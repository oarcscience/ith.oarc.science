### CHAPTER II.

1\. For in the third fargar*d* ('chapter) of the Vendidad of
Mê*d*ôk-mâh <span id="fr_1244"></span>[1](#fn_1237.md) *it* is declared
that when life is resigned without effort <span
id="fr_1245"></span>[2](#fn_1238.md), at the time when the life departs,
when a dog is tied to his foot, even then the Nasû*s* <span
id="fr_1246"></span>[3](#fn_1239.md) rushes upon it, and afterwards, when
seen by it, the Nasû*s* is destroyed by it. 2. This is where *it is
stated* which is the dog which destroys the Nasû*s* <span
id="fr_1247"></span>[4](#fn_1240.md), the shepherd's dog, the village-dog,
the blood-hound, the slender hound <span
id="fr_1248"></span>[5](#fn_1241.md), and the rûkûnîk <span
id="fr_1249"></span>[6](#fn_1242.md);

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

and as to the rûkûnîk there have been divers opinions, *as*
Vand-Aûharmazd <span id="fr_1250"></span>[1](#fn_1243.md) asserted, from
the teaching of Afarg, that it does not destroy *it*. 3. The dog
destroys the Nasû*s* at the time when it sees the flesh, and when it
sees the hair or nails it does not destroy *it* <span
id="fr_1251"></span>[2](#fn_1244.md). 4. A blind dog also destroys *it* at
the time when it places a paw <span id="fr_1252"></span>[3](#fn_1245.md) on
the corpse; and when it places *it* upon the hair or nails it does not
destroy *it* <span id="fr_1253"></span>[4](#fn_1246.md). 5. The birds which
destroy the Nasû*s* are three: the mountain kite, the black crow, and
the vulture <span id="fr_1254"></span>[5](#fn_1247.md); the bird, moreover,
destroys *it* at the time when *its* shadow falls upon it; when it sees
it in the water, a mirror, or a looking-glass, it does not destroy
*it* <span id="fr_1255"></span>[6](#fn_1248.md).

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

6\. Vand-Aûharmazd said, where a pregnant woman is to be carried by two
men <span id="fr_1256"></span>[1](#fn_1249.md), both are to be cleansed by
the Bareshnûm *ceremony* <span id="fr_1257"></span>[2](#fn_1250.md), and
the head of the corpse, when they carry it away, is to be set towards
the Dakhma <span id="fr_1258"></span>[3](#fn_1251.md). 7. And on account of
contamination

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
(pa*d*vîshak) <span id="fr_1259"></span>[1](#fn_1252.md) two are not to be
carried at one time, and two by one person are not proper; one dog and
one person are proper <span id="fr_1260"></span>[2](#fn_1253.md). 8. Every
one who understands the care of a corpse is proper; two boys of eight
years old, who understand the care, are proper; a woman free from
menstruation, or free from dead

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

matter <span id="fr_1261"></span>[1](#fn_1254.md), or a man, with a woman
or a child of eight years old, is proper.

9\. It is not to be carried all covered up <span
id="fr_1262"></span>[2](#fn_1255.md), for *that* is burying the corpse; to
carry *it* in the rain is worthy of death <span
id="fr_1263"></span>[3](#fn_1256.md). 10. When clouds have been
around <span id="fr_1264"></span>[4](#fn_1257.md), it is allowable to carry
*it* away from the house; and when rain sets in upon the road it is not
allowable to carry *it* back to the house; *but* when it is before a
veranda (dâhlî*z*) *one* should put *it* down there; that is allowable
when he who owns the veranda is apprehensive, *and* when he does not
allow *it* inside; and, afterwards, it is to be carried away to its
place, and when the water stands the height of a javelin (nî*z*ak)
inside <span id="fr_1265"></span>[5](#fn_1258.md), *one* puts *it* down
*and* brings *it* away yet again. 11. Mê*d*ôk-mâh <span
id="fr_1266"></span>[6](#fn_1259.md) says that there should be a shelter
(var) <span id="fr_1267"></span>[7](#fn_1260.md) *one* should

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

fasten above that place, *and* it would make *it* dry below <span
id="fr_1268"></span>[1](#fn_1261.md); *one* should place the corpse under
that shelter, and they may take the shelter *and* bring *it* away.

12\. From the fifth fargar*d* of the Vendidad of Mê*d*ôk-mâh <span
id="fr_1269"></span>[2](#fn_1262.md) they state thus, that at the place
where one's life goes forth, when he shall die upon a cloth, and a hair
or a limb remains upon the bed-place and the ground <span
id="fr_1270"></span>[3](#fn_1263.md), the ground conveys the pollution,
even not originating with *itself* (ahambûni*k*), in like manner down
unto the water <span id="fr_1271"></span>[4](#fn_1264.md). 13. And when *he
is* on a bedstead, and *its* legs are not connected with the ground,
when a hair or a limb remains behind on the bedstead, it does not convey
*the pollution* down. 14. When he shall die on a plastered floor the
plaster is polluted, and when they dig up that plaster, and spread *it*
again afterwards, it is clean. 15. When he shall die on a stone, and the
stone is connected with the ground, the stone will become clean, *along*
with the ground, in the length of a year; and when they dig up the
place, the stone *being* polluted is to be washed at the time. 16. When
a stone is connected with the ground, or is separated, and *one* shall
die upon it, so much space of the stone as the corpse occupied is
polluted  <span id="fr_1272"></span>[5](#fn_1265.md);

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

when they shall leave it, in the length of a year it will become clean
*along* with the ground; and when they dig *it* up, the stone is all
polluted, *and* is to be washed at the time; when the stone is not made
*even* with the ground, above the ground the stone is all polluted,
*and* is to be washed at the time.

17\. Dung-fuel *and* ashes, when the limbs of a menstruous woman come
upon them, are both polluted; and the salt and lime for washing *her*
shift (kartak-shûî) are *to be treated* just like stone <span
id="fr_1273"></span>[1](#fn_1266.md).

18\. If *one* shall die on a terrace roof (bân) <span
id="fr_1274"></span>[2](#fn_1267.md), when one of his limbs, or a hair,
remains behind at the edge of the roof, the roof is polluted *for* the
size of the body as far as the water; and they should carry down all the
*sacred* twigs (baresôm) <span id="fr_1275"></span>[3](#fn_1268.md) in the
house, from the place where the pollution is, until there are thirty
steps of three feet <span id="fr_1276"></span>[4](#fn_1269.md) to the
*sacred* twigs, so that the *sacred* twigs may not be polluted; and when
his hair or limb has not come to the eaves (parakân) the roof is
polluted to the bottom (tôhîk). 19. And when *one* shall die on a
rîtâ <span id="fr_1277"></span>[5](#fn_1270.md) *it* is polluted

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

*for* the size of the body as far as the water; *in* the length of a
year it will become clean *along* with the ground. 20. A built bridge is
*liable* just like a terrace roof. 21. When *one* shall die on the
terrace roof of a trellised *apartment* (varam), that is also *liable*
just like a terrace roof. 22. When he shall die in a trellised
*apartment*, when one of his limbs, or a hair, does not remain on the
borders (parakân), it does not convey the pollution down, but when *any*
of him remains behind it conveys *it* down; it is allowable when they
dig *it* up <span id="fr_1278"></span>[1](#fn_1271.md), and *one* also
spreads *it* again afterwards, and *it* is clean.

23\. When *one* shall die by strangulation and a rope in a crowd, when
*there* is no fear of his falling down they should not carry *him* down;
and when *there* is a fear of his falling down, when that fear is as
regards one side of him, they should carry *him* down on that side; and
when *he has* fallen down they should carry *him* down *in* such *place*
as *he has* fallen. 24. When *one* is seated upright *and* shall die,
when *there* is fear of his falling on one side they should carry *him*
down *on* that one side, and when there is fear on all four sides,
*then* on all four sides; and when *he has* fallen down they should
carry *him* down in such place as *he has* fallen <span
id="fr_1279"></span>[2](#fn_1272.md).

25\. And when *one* shall die on a tree, when its

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

bark is green and *there* is no fear of falling off, they should not
carry *him* down; and when *there* is fear of it, they should carry down
the whole of the body (tanû masâî). 26. And when the bark of the tree is
withered, when *there* is fear of it and when *there* is no fear of it,
they should carry *it* down. 27. When he shall die on a branch of a tree
which is green, when *there* is no fear of his falling off they should
not carry *him* down. 28. And when *there* is fear of it, or *it is* a
branch of a withered tree, when also, a hair originating with him, or a
limb, remains behind on the particular tree, they should carry down the
whole of the body <span id="fr_1280"></span>[1](#fn_1273.md). 29. And when
it does not remain behind him on the particular tree, but when *there*
is fear of its falling off, they should not carry it below (vad
frô*d*) <span id="fr_1281"></span>[2](#fn_1274.md).

30\. When a corpse (nasâî-1) <span id="fr_1282"></span>[3](#fn_1275.md),
from outside of it, remains behind on a jar (khûmbŏ) in which *there*
may be wine, the jar is polluted, *and* the wine is clean. 31. And when
*one* shall die inside, in the wine in the jar, if not even a hair or a
curl originating with him remains behind on the jar, the wine is
polluted and the jar not polluted <span
id="fr_1283"></span>[4](#fn_1276.md). 32. When *it is*

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

a jar in which *there* is oil <span id="fr_1284"></span>[1](#fn_1277.md),
and dead matter (nasâî), from outside of it, remains behind on it, this
is even *as* though it remains inside it, because the oil comes outside
and goes back to the inside, *and* both are polluted, the jar and the
oil; and even on making the jar dry <span
id="fr_1285"></span>[2](#fn_1278.md) it is not fit to put anything in.

33\. When a serpent (gar*z*ak) is in a jar in which *there* is wine,
both are useless and polluted, for it makes *them* contaminated
(pa*d*vîshak). 34. And when corn shall be in *it*, the jar is polluted
and the corn clean; and when nothing originating with *the serpent*
inside the jar remains behind on the jar, so much of the corn as
includes the serpent, and upon *which* the touch (mâli*s*n) of the
serpent has gone—because the touch of the serpent's seed might be the
death of one—is to be taken out *and* to be thrown away. 35. And when
hair or dead matter, even not originating with *the serpent*, remains
behind on the jar, the jar is polluted, but is serviceable (shâya*d*) on
making *it* dry <span id="fr_1286"></span>[3](#fn_1279.md).

36\. Brick, earth, and mortar are separated by

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

their own substance (pavan mindavam-i naf*s*man), and are connected with
the ground; being separated by their own substance is this, that so much
space as dead matter <span id="fr_1287"></span>[1](#fn_1280.md) comes upon
is polluted; being connected with the ground is this, that they would
convey the pollution down unto the water. 37. Dung-fuel, ashes, flour,
and other powdered things are connected with their own substance, and
are separated from the ground; being connected with their own substance
is this, that when dead matter comes upon them the whole of them is
polluted; and being separated from the ground is this, that when dead
matter comes upon them it does not make the ground polluted <span
id="fr_1288"></span>[2](#fn_1281.md).

38\. *At* a house *in* which the *sacred* ceremony (ya*z*i*s*n) is
prepared, and a dog or a person passes <span
id="fr_1289"></span>[3](#fn_1282.md) away in it, the first business to be
done is this, that the fire is to be preserved from harm; moreover, if
it be only possible to carry the fire so that they would carry *it* away
within three steps of the corpse <span
id="fr_1290"></span>[4](#fn_1283.md), even then it is to be carried away,
*and* the

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

wall is not to be cut. 39. Rôshan <span
id="fr_1291"></span>[1](#fn_1284.md) said that an earthen *one* is to be
cut into, *but* a mortar *one* is not to be cut; below and above no
account *is taken* of damaging (bo*d*ôzê*d*îh) <span
id="fr_1292"></span>[2](#fn_1285.md) the wall <span
id="fr_1293"></span>[3](#fn_1286.md). 40. To bring the fire within <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[4](#fn_1287.md) the three steps from the corpse is a
Tanâpûhar sin; and when exudation happens to the corpse, it is worthy of
death <span id="fr_1295"></span>[5](#fn_1288.md). 41. The prepared food in
that house is all useless, and that which is not prepared is usable in
the length of nine nights

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

*or* a month <span id="fr_1296"></span>[1](#fn_1289.md). 42. Clothing also
*in* like manner, except that which *one* wears on the body; that, even
in that time, is not clean, since it remains in use. 43. And the
holy-water (zôhar) <span id="fr_1297"></span>[2](#fn_1290.md), too, which
is taken and remains *in* that place, is to be carried away immediately
to the water; also the sacred milk (*g*îv) <span
id="fr_1298"></span>[3](#fn_1291) *and* butter (*g*um.md) <span
id="fr_1299"></span>[4](#fn_1292.md) *in* like manner. 44. Of the
prayer <span id="fr_1300"></span>[5](#fn_1293.md) clothing
Vand-Aûharmazd <span id="fr_1301"></span>[6](#fn_1294.md) said that it is
usable in the length of nine nights *or* a month, the writer <span
id="fr_1302"></span>[7](#fn_1295) (dapîr.md) said that it is when they
perform the washing of hands, and wash *it* thoroughly, it will become
clean at the time.

45\. If in a house there are three rooms (gun*g*înak), and *one* shall
die in the entrance place (dargâs), if *it be* so that they may set the
door open, and the corpse comes to this side, only this

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

side is polluted; and if the corpse comes to that side, only that side
is polluted; when it comes to both sides at once (aêvâ*k*), only the
entrance place is polluted alone, both the dwelling-rooms (khânak) are
clean.

46\. And the vault of the sacred fires <span
id="fr_1303"></span>[1](#fn_1296.md) alone does not become polluted.

47\. If *one* shall die in a wild spot (va*s*kar), prepared food which
is within three steps is all useless, and beyond four steps it is not
polluted. 48. Prepared food is this, such as bread, boiled and roast
meat, and prepared broth <span id="fr_1304"></span>[2](#fn_1297.md).

49\. And the ashes (var) of the sacred fire <span
id="fr_1305"></span>[3](#fn_1298.md) become in a measure polluted.

50\. Should they carry in the fire into that house in which the length
of nine nights *or* a month is requisite for becoming clean, *there* is
a sin of one Tanâpûhar <span id="fr_1306"></span>[4](#fn_1299.md) through
carrying *it* in, and one Tanâpûhar through kindling *it*; and every
trifling *creature* (khûr or khûl) which shall die and shall remain
*causes* a sin of one Tanâpûhar. 51. Also through carrying water in,
*there* is a sin of one Farmân; and to pour water on the place where
*any* one's life departs is a sin of one Tanâpûhar, and to pour *it* on
a different place is a sin of one Yât. 52. And to

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

undergo ablution <span id="fr_1307"></span>[1](#fn_1300.md) inside *the
unclean house* is all non-ablution. 53. And whoever goes into it
needlessly, *his* body *and* clothes are to be every time thoroughly
washed, and his sin is one Tanâpûhar <span
id="fr_1308"></span>[1](#fn_1300.md); and when he goes in needfully *it* is
neither good work nor sin <span id="fr_1309"></span>[2](#fn_1301.md).

54\. And this pollution is all in the sharp account (tîkhak amâr) when
the life departs <span id="fr_1310"></span>[3](#fn_1302.md); the only
*thing* which amounts to polluting is contact with the flesh, and even
with the hair and nails. 55. Of the contact which is stated in the
Avesta <span id="fr_1311"></span>[4](#fn_1303.md), the account is *that it
is* from one side, and it ever cleaves to *one*; the curse
(ga*z*i*s*n) <span id="fr_1312"></span>[5](#fn_1304.md) which is stated in
the Avesta advances from all four sides. 56. Sôshyans <span
id="fr_1313"></span>[6](#fn_1305.md) said it is, until its exhibition to a
dog, just as it becomes at the time when its life departs <span
id="fr_1314"></span>[7](#fn_1306.md); a priest, a

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

warrior, and a husbandman are no use, for merely a dog is stated. 57.
Kûshtanŏ-bû*g*ê*d* <span id="fr_1315"></span>[1](#fn_1307.md) said the
account is at the time when its life departs; and that which
Kûshtanŏ-bû*g*ê*d* specially said is, 'when anything is inside it (the
place) the pollution is as far as to the place where that thing stands.'
58. When a dog, or a goat, or a pig is requisite (dârvâî) <span
id="fr_1316"></span>[2](#fn_1308.md) it is proper, for *the pollution* does
not attack further there; and the pollution of a child in the womb is
*along* with the mother.

59\. The direct pollution of a hedgehog <span
id="fr_1317"></span>[3](#fn_1309.md) cleaves to *one*, and not the indirect
pollution. 60. Direct pollution (hamrê*d*) <span
id="fr_1318"></span>[4](#fn_1310.md) is that when the body is in contact
with a corpse, and indirect pollution (paîtrê*d*)

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

is that when <span id="fr_1319"></span>[1](#fn_1311.md) *one* is in contact
with him who touched the corpse and from contact with him who is the
eleventh <span id="fr_1320"></span>[2](#fn_1312.md) indirect pollution
cleaves to *one in* the same manner. 61. The indirect pollution of an
ape <span id="fr_1321"></span>[3](#fn_1313.md) and a menstruous woman, not
acting the same *way*, remains. 62. The shepherd's dog, and likewise the
village-dog, and others also of the like kind carry contamination to
eight <span id="fr_1322"></span>[4](#fn_1314.md); and when they, shall
carry *the carcase* down on the ground *the place* <span
id="fr_1323"></span>[5](#fn_1315.md) is clean immediately; and that, too,
which dies on a balcony (â*s*kûp), until they shall carry *it* down to
the bottom, is polluted *for* the length of a year.

63\. Whoever brings dead matter (nasâî) on any person is worthy of
death; he is thrice worthy, of

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

death <span id="fr_1324"></span>[1](#fn_1316.md) at the time when a dog
*has* not seen the corpse (nasâî); and *if* through negligence of
appliances and means (*k*âr va tûbânŏ) he disturbs *it*, and disturbs
*it* by touching it, he knows that *it is* a sin worthy of death; and
*for* a corpse that a dog *has* seen, and *one that* a dog *has* not
seen, the accountability is to be understood *to be* as much <span
id="fr_1325"></span>[2](#fn_1317.md), and *for* the death and
sickness <span id="fr_1326"></span>[3](#fn_1318.md) of a feeble man *and* a
powerful *one*. 64. Afarg has said there is no account of appliances and
means <span id="fr_1327"></span>[4](#fn_1319.md), for *it* is not allowable
to commit a sin worthy of death in *cases of* death and sickness.

65\. When they move a corpse which a dog *has* not seen with a thousand
men, even then the bodies of the whole *number* are polluted <span
id="fr_1328"></span>[5](#fn_1320.md), and are to be washed for them with
ceremony (pî*s*ak) <span id="fr_1329"></span>[6](#fn_1321.md). 66. And
*for* that which a dog *has* seen, except that one only when a man shall
move *it* all <span id="fr_1330"></span>[7](#fn_1322.md) by touching *it*,
his washing is then not *to be* with ceremony. 67. And when he is in
contact *and* does not move *it*, he is to be washed with bull's urine
*and* water. 68. And

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

when he shall move with a stake (dâr) <span
id="fr_1331"></span>[1](#fn_1323.md) a corpse which a dog *has* not seen,
except that one only when he shall move *it* all, the washing for him is
not *to be* with ceremony.

69\. And when a man shall move a corpse, which a dog *has* not seen, by
the hand of another man, *he* who moves it by the hand of a man, *and*
he also whose own hand's strength *does it* are polluted in the bodies
of both; and it is the root of a Tanâpûhar <span
id="fr_1332"></span>[2](#fn_1324.md) *sin* for him himself and of a
Tanâpûhar for the other one, for this *reason*, because his own body and
that also of the *other* are both made polluted through sinfulness. 70.
And when there is not in him, nor even originating with *him*
(ahambûni*k*), the strength of him whose own hand *it is*, it is just as
though, he would move it (the corpse) with a stake <span
id="fr_1333"></span>[3](#fn_1325.md); and he who held *it* in the way of
contact with his hand is to be washed with ceremony; and it is the root
of a Tanâpûhar sin for him whose own hand *it is*, and of a Khôr <span
id="fr_1334"></span>[4](#fn_1326.md) for himself. 71. When he shall move a
corpse by the hand of a man, and the corpse is of those which a dog
*has* seen—except that one only when he shall move it all <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[5](#fn_1327.md)—the washing for him is not *to be*
with ceremony.

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

72\. When *one* is going *by* a place at night, and comes back there
*on* the morrow, and a corpse lies there, and he does not know whether
the evil (dû*s*) was there when he came by <span
id="fr_1336"></span>[1](#fn_1328.md), or not, it is to be considered by him
that it was not there.

73\. Of a flock in which is a sheep by whom dead matter is eaten, of a
forest in which is a tree with which dead matter is mingled, and of a
firewood-stand (aesamdân) in which is a stick of firewood with which
grease is mingled, Afarg said that it is not proper to make the flock
and the forest fruitful, and the firewood is useless <span
id="fr_1337"></span>[2](#fn_1329.md).

74\. *About* a door on which a corpse impinges; as to the door of a town
and city they have been of the same opinion, that *it* is to be
discarded by *his* comrades (hamkâr) <span
id="fr_1338"></span>[3](#fn_1330.md); as to a door which is mostly closed
(badtûm) <span id="fr_1339"></span>[4](#fn_1331.md) they have been of
different opinions,

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Gôgô*s*asp <span
id="fr_1340"></span>[1](#fn_1332.md) said that discarding *it* by *his*
comrades is likewise proper, and Sôshyans said that it is not proper;
and as to other doors they have been of the same opinion, that it is not
proper. 75. The door of one's own chief apartment (shah-gâs) is fit for
that of the place for menstruation (da*s*tânistân), and that of the
place for menstruation is fit for that of the depository *for the dead*
(khazânŏ) <span id="fr_1341"></span>[2](#fn_1333.md), and that of the
depository of the dead is not fit for any purpose whatever <span
id="fr_1342"></span>[3](#fn_1334.md); that of the more pleasant is fit for
that of the more grievous.

76\. Any one who, through sinfulness, throws a corpse into the water, is
worthy of death on the spot <span id="fr_1343"></span>[4](#fn_1335.md);
when he throws only one *it is* one *sin* worthy of death, *and* when he
throws ten at one time *it is* then one *sin* worthy of death; when he
throws *them* separately *it is* a *sin* worthy of death for each one.
77. Of the water, into which *one* throws dead matter, the extent of
pollution is three steps of three feet *in* the water advancing, nine
steps of three feet *in* the water *passed* over, and six steps of three
feet *in* the water alongside <span id="fr_1344"></span>[5](#fn_1336.md);
six steps of three feet in the depth of the water, and three steps of
three feet in the water pouring over the dead matter are polluted as
regards the depth <span id="fr_1345"></span>[6](#fn_1337.md). 78. When it
is thrown *into* the midst of a great standing water, in like manner,
the proportion it comes is ever as much as it goes, *and*

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

*is* the proportion of it they should always carry *away* with *the dead
matter* <span id="fr_1346"></span>[1](#fn_1338.md).

79\. And when a man comes forth, and a corpse lies in the water, when he
is able to bring it out, and it is not an injury to him, it is not
allowable to abandon *it* except when he brings *it* out <span
id="fr_1347"></span>[2](#fn_1339.md). 80. Sôshyans <span
id="fr_1348"></span>[3](#fn_1340.md) said that, when it is an injury, it is
allowable when <span id="fr_1349"></span>[4](#fn_1341.md) he does not bring
*it* out; and when it is not an injury, and he does not bring *it*, his
sin is a Tanâpûhar <span id="fr_1350"></span>[5](#fn_1342.md). 81.
Kûshtanŏ-bû*g*ê*d* <span id="fr_1351"></span>[6](#fn_1343.md) said that
even in *case of* injury it is not allowable to abandon *it*, except
when he brings *it* out; when he does not bring *it he* is worthy of
death. 82. And Gôgô*s*asp <span id="fr_1352"></span>[7](#fn_1344.md) said
that it is even in *case of* injury not allowable, except when he brings
*it* out; and when, in *case of* injury, he does not bring *it* out his
sin is a Tanâpûhar; and when it is no injury to him, and he does not
bring *it, he* is worthy of death.

83\. And when he shall wish to bring *it* his clothing is to be laid
aside <span id="fr_1353"></span>[8](#fn_1345.md), for it makes the clothing

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

polluted, and whatever *he* is first able *and* best able *to bring* is
to be brought out by him. 84. When, too, he is able to bring *it* out
through the breadth of the water, then also it is to be brought out
so <span id="fr_1354"></span>[1](#fn_1346.md); and when he is not able, it
is to be brought out through the length of the water; and showing *it
to* a dog *and* the two men are not to be waited for <span
id="fr_1355"></span>[2](#fn_1347.md).

85\. And it is to be carried by him so much away from the neighbourhood
of the water that, when he puts *it* down, the water which comes out
dropping from the corpse does not reach back to the water; for when the
water which comes out from the corpse reaches continuously back to the
water *he* is worthy of death; and after that (min zak frâ*g*) it is to
be shown *to* a dog, and it is to be carried away by two men. 86. And
when he wishes to throw *it* out from the water, Mar*d*-bû*d* <span
id="fr_1356"></span>[3](#fn_1348.md) said it is allowable to throw *it* out
thus, so that the water of the dripping corpse does not reach
continuously back to the water; Rôshan said it would be allowable to
throw *it* out far.

87\. To drag *it* over the water is allowable, to grasp and relinquish
*it* is not allowable <span id="fr_1357"></span>[4](#fn_1349.md); and when
it is possible to act so that he may convey *it* from a great water to a
small water, when the water is

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

connected *it* is allowable, and when separated *it* is not allowable.
88. Afarg <span id="fr_1358"></span>[1](#fn_1350.md) said it is allowable
to drag *it* below through the water, but to drag *it* over is not
allowable, for this has come *on* the water *as* a danger <span
id="fr_1359"></span>[2](#fn_1351.md), and that has not come on *it as* a
danger. 89. Mê*d*ôk-mâh <span id="fr_1360"></span>[1](#fn_1350.md) said it
is allowable to drag *it* above, *but* to drag *it* below is not
allowable, for the danger has gone out across the water, and the danger
is not now to be brought upon it; and on that which is below, *on* which
the danger has not come, the danger will at last arrive.

90\. When he goes into the water he is to go into it with this idea,
that 'should there be many below, then I will even bring all;' for
whoever goes in not with this idea, and shall disturb any other one
which lies there, will become polluted <span
id="fr_1361"></span>[3](#fn_1352.md). 91. And if the corpse be heavy *and*
it is not possible to bring *it* out by one person; *and* he goes out
with this idea, that 'I *will* go and prepare means, and bring this
corpse out of the water;' and when through sinfulness <span
id="fr_1362"></span>[4](#fn_1353.md) he does not go back his body is
polluted *and* worthy of

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

death, and when he is unable to go back he is not polluted.

92\. When the corpse is so decomposed (pû*d*ak), when *it* is thus
necessary to bring it out, that, he must cut off various fragments, even
after he cuts *them* off *they* are to be brought out; and for every
fragment his hands and knife are to be washed with bull's urine
(gômê*z*), and with dust and moisture (nambŏ) *they* are clean <span
id="fr_1363"></span>[1](#fn_1354.md). 93. And *they* are to be torn
off <span id="fr_1364"></span>[2](#fn_1355.md) by him, and for every single
fragment which he brings out his good work is one Tanâpûhar.

94\. And when rain is falling the corpse lies in the water; to take *it*
from the water to deposit *it* in the rain is not <span
id="fr_1365"></span>[3](#fn_1356.md) allowable.

95\. Clothing which is useless <span id="fr_1366"></span>[4](#fn_1357.md),
this is that in which they should carry a corpse, and that even when
very much *or* altogether useless; of that on which they shall
decompose <span id="fr_1367"></span>[5](#fn_1358) (barâ vishûpênd.md), and
of that on which the excretions (hîkhar) of the dead come, so much space
is to be cut away <span id="fr_1368"></span>[6](#fn_1359.md), and the rest
is to be

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

thoroughly washed for the six-months’ *period* <span
id="fr_1369"></span>[1](#fn_1360.md). 96. That which a menstruous woman has
in wear (mahmânîh) <span id="fr_1370"></span>[2](#fn_1361.md) is to be
discarded in like fashion.

97\. The clothing which is to be washed for the six-months’ *period* is
such as is declared in the Avesta <span
id="fr_1371"></span>[3](#fn_1362.md). 98. If the clothing be leathern it is
to be thoroughly washed three times with bull's urine (gômê*z*), every
time to be made quite dry with dust, and to be thoroughly washed three
times with water, and to be laid out three months in a place to be
viewed by the sun <span id="fr_1372"></span>[4](#fn_1363.md); and then it
is proper for an unclean person (armê*s*t) <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[5](#fn_1364.md) who has not performed

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

worship, or it is proper for a menstruous woman. 99. Other clothing,
when hair is on *it* <span id="fr_1374"></span>[1](#fn_1365.md), is
*liable* just like woven *cloth* (ta*d*ak); all the washing of wool,
floss silk, silk, hair, and camel's hair is just like *that of* woven
*cloth*; and woven clothing is to be washed six times <span
id="fr_1375"></span>[2](#fn_1366.md).

100\. Wool which is connected together, when one *part* is twisted over
another, and a corpse rests <span id="fr_1376"></span>[3](#fn_1367.md) upon
it, is all polluted on account of the connection; and when fleece (mêsh)
rests upon fleece, then so much space as the corpse rests upon is
polluted. 101. When *one* shall die upon a rich carpet (bûp) when the
carpet is on a coarse rug (nama*d*) *and* is made connected, the rug and
carpet are both polluted, and when separated the rug is clean. 102. When
several cushions are heaped (ni*k*î*d*) one upon the other, and are not
made connected, and dead matter comes upon them, they have been
unanimous that only that one is polluted on which the dead matter came.
103. A cushion *together* with wool <span
id="fr_1377"></span>[4](#fn_1368.md) is *liable* just like a carpet with a
rug <span id="fr_1378"></span>[5](#fn_1369.md). 104. Of several cushions
which are tied down together, when dead matter comes to the tie, both
are polluted, the cord *and* the cushions; and when the dead matter
comes to a cushion, and does not come to the tie, the cushions are all
polluted on account of the connection, and the tie is clean <span
id="fr_1379"></span>[6](#fn_1370.md).

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

105\. A pregnant woman who devours dead matter through sinfulness is
polluted *and* worthy of death, and there is no washing for her <span
id="fr_1380"></span>[1](#fn_1371.md); and *as for* the child, when it *has*
become acquainted with duties (pî*s*ak-shinâs), ashes <span
id="fr_1381"></span>[2](#fn_1372.md) and bull's urine are for its eating
and for its washing. 106. *As for* a child who is born of solitary
carriers *of the dead* <span id="fr_1382"></span>[3](#fn_1373.md), although
its father and mother may both have devoured dead matter through
sinfulness, that which is born is clean on the spot, for it does not
become polluted *by* birth.

107\. Rôshan <span id="fr_1383"></span>[4](#fn_1374.md) said that every
one, who, through sinfulness, has become polluted by means of dead
matter, is worthy of death, and his polluted. body never becomes clean;
for this *one* is more wretched than the fox which *one* throws into the
water living, and in the water it will die. 108. *One* worthy of death
never becomes clean; *and* a solitary carrier *of the dead* is to be
kept at thirty steps from *ceremonial* ablution (pâ*d*îyâ*v*îh).

109\. Whichsoever of the animal species has eaten their dead
matter <span id="fr_1384"></span>[5](#fn_1375.md), its milk, dung, hair,
*and* wool are polluted the length of a year; and *if* pregnant when it
has eaten *it*, the young one has also eaten *it*, and the young one is
clean after the length of a year from being born of the mother. 110.
When a male which has eaten *it* mounts a female, the female is not
polluted. 111. When dead matter is eaten by it,

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

and even while it is not digested it shall die, it is *liable* just like
a leathern bag (anbân) in which is dead matter.

112\. Gold, when dead matter comes upon it, is to be once thoroughly
washed with bull's urine (gômê*z*), to be once made quite dry with dust,
and to be once thoroughly washed with water, and it is clean <span
id="fr_1385"></span>[1](#fn_1376.md). 113. Silver is to be twice thoroughly
washed with bull's urine, and to be made quite dry with dust, and is to
be twice thoroughly washed with water, and *it is* clean <span
id="fr_1386"></span>[2](#fn_1377.md). 114. And iron, *in like manner*,
three times, steel four times, and stone six times <span
id="fr_1387"></span>[3](#fn_1378.md). 115. Afarg said: 'Should it be
quicksilver (â*v*gînak) <span id="fr_1388"></span>[4](#fn_1379.md) it is
*liable* just like gold, and amber (kahrupâî) just like stone, and all
jewels just like iron. 116. The pearl (mûrvârî*d*) <span
id="fr_1389"></span>[5](#fn_1380.md), amber, the

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

ruby (yâkand) gem, the turquoise <span
id="fr_1390"></span>[1](#fn_1381), the agate (shapak.md), coral-stone
(vasa*d*în sag), bone, and other substances (gôhar) which are not
particularly mentioned, are to be washed just like wood <span
id="fr_1391"></span>[2](#fn_1382.md); and when they are taken into use
there is no washing <span id="fr_1392"></span>[3](#fn_1383.md), and when
they are not taken their washing is once. 117. Of earthen *and* horny
*articles* there is no washing; and of other substances which are not
taken for use the washing is once, and *they are* declared out of use.

118\. Firewood, when green, is to be cut off the length of a span
(vitast), one by one, as many *sticks* as there are—and when dry one
span and two finger-*breadths* <span
id="fr_1393"></span>[4](#fn_1384.md)—and is to be deposited *in* some place
the length of a year, and water is not to be dropped upon *it*; and *it
is* drawn out *after* the length of a year; Sôshyans <span
id="fr_1394"></span>[5](#fn_1385.md) said that it is proper as firewood for
*ordinary* fires, and Kûshtanŏ-bû*g*ê*d* <span
id="fr_1395"></span>[6](#fn_1386.md) said that *it is* just as declared in
the Avesta: 'The

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

washed *one*, even then, is proper in dried clothing <span
id="fr_1396"></span>[1](#fn_1387.md).' 119. About corn <span
id="fr_1397"></span>[2](#fn_1388.md) they have been unanimous that so much
space is polluted as the dead matter comes upon; and of that which is
lowered into pits <span id="fr_1398"></span>[3](#fn_1389.md), or is wanted
*to be so*, and of that which is scattered (af*s*î*d*) at such a place
*there are* different opinions; Sôshyans said: 'Should it be of such a
place *it* is polluted as much as the dead matter *has* come upon it;'
and Gôgô*s*asp <span id="fr_1399"></span>[4](#fn_1390.md) said: 'Should it
be *so it* is all polluted, *and* the straw is all polluted.'

120\. A walnut <span id="fr_1400"></span>[5](#fn_1391.md), through *its*
mode of connection, is all polluted, and the washing of both its shell
and kernel (pôst va mazg) is just like *that of* wood. 121. A
pomegranate also is of such nature as a walnut. 122. *As to* the date,
when its stalk <span id="fr_1401"></span>[6](#fn_1392.md) is not connected
the date is polluted and the stalk *and* stone (âstak) are clean; the
washing of the date is just like *that of* corn; and when it is touched
upon the stalk, when the stalk, stone, and date are connected, the whole
is polluted; *as to* the date when not connected with the stalk, *and*
touched at the

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

stalk, the date is clean, and the washing of the stone is just like
*that of* wood. 123. The pomegranate, citron, quince, apple, pear, and
other fruit, when in bearing and the rind (pazâ*v*i*s*nŏ) is perceptible
on it, when dead matter comes upon it *there* is no pollution of it; and
when the rind (pazâmi*s*nŏ) is not perceptible on it, its washing is
just like *that of* corn; and rind is ever with the citron <span
id="fr_1402"></span>[1](#fn_1393.md). 124. *For* meat, butter, milk,
cheese, and preserves (rî*k*âr) there is no washing <span
id="fr_1403"></span>[2](#fn_1394.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1237"></span>[245:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1244.md) Alluding probably
to Mê*d*ôk-mâh's complete commentary on the Vendidad (now no longer
extant), as the commentary on Pahl. Vend. III, 48, which treats of
Sag-dî*d* or dog-gaze, does not mention Mê*d*ôk-mâh or any of the
details described here in the text; these details, however, are to be
found in Pahl. Vend., VII, 4.

<span id="fn_1238"></span>[245:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1245.md) Reading amat barâ
zôr *g*ân dâ*d*. This phrase occurs only in M6 (as a marginal note) and
in the text of its descendants. Assuming that barâ may be a miswriting
of pavan (see [p. 176](sbe0552.htm#page_176.md), note
[5](sbe0552.htm#fn_989).md), we might read amat pavan zôr shûyâ*d*, 'when
he shall wash with holy-water.'

<span id="fn_1239"></span>[245:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1246.md) The 'corruption'
which is supposed to enter a corpse shortly after death, whence it
issues in the form of a fiend and seizes upon any one who touches the
corpse, unless it has been destroyed, or driven away, by the gaze of a
dog, as mentioned in the text (compare Vend. VIII, 38-48). The carcase
of a dog is considered equally contagious with the corpse of a human
being, and when the fiend of corruption (Nasû*s* or Nas of Bund. XXVIII,
29) has seized upon any one, it can be driven out only by a long and
troublesome form of purification described in Vend. VIII. 111-228, IX,
4-117.

<span id="fn_1240"></span>[245:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1247.md) This statement is
now to be found in Pahl. Vend. VII, 4.

<span id="fn_1241"></span>[245:5](sbe0562.htm#fr_1248.md) See Bund. XIV,
19. The Persian Rivâyats of Kâmah Bahrah and Kâûs Kâmân (quoted in B29)
describe these dogs as 'the shepherd's dog, the house-dog, the strange
or tame (gharîb) dog, and the puppy.'

<span id="fn_1242"></span>[245:6](sbe0562.htm#fr_1249.md) Probably the Av.
sukuruna of Vend. V, 100, XIII, 48, which <span id="page_246">p.
246</span> is translated by hûkar or hûkûr in the Pahlavi version. This
fifth kind of dog is called 'the blind (kûr) dog' in the Persian
Rivâyats; but Pahl. Vend. VII, 4 asserts that, 'Sôshâns said the rûkunîk
also destroys it,' and then speaks of the blind dog as in § 4.

<span id="fn_1243"></span>[246:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1250.md) See the note on
Chap. I, 4.

<span id="fn_1244"></span>[246:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1251.md) This is also
stated in Pahl. Vend. III, 138.

<span id="fn_1245"></span>[246:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1252.md) See Pahl. Vend.
VII, 4.

<span id="fn_1246"></span>[246:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1253.md) The Persian
Rivâyats say this is because the Nasû*s* is concealed beneath the hair
and nails (compare Vend. VII, 70).

<span id="fn_1247"></span>[246:5](sbe0562.htm#fr_1254.md) These are the
birds 'created for devouring dead matter' (see Bund. XIX, 25). Pahl.
Vend. VII, 4 substitutes an eagle (dâlman) for the vulture.

<span id="fn_1248"></span>[246:6](sbe0562.htm#fr_1255.md) This sentence is
probably defective, as the last clause evidently refers to the dog's
gaze (see Pahl. Vend. III, 138), and not to the bird's shadow; the rule,
however, is applicable to both. Thus the Persian Rivâyats state that if
the bird's shadow falls upon the hair or the nails of the corpse, or if
the bird's shadow, or the dog's gaze falls upon a corpse in the water,
or upon its reflection in a mirror, the Nasû*s* is not destroyed. Dastûr
Jâmâspji is of opinion that the utility of the bird's shadow is intended
to apply only to cases of death in uninhabited places, where a dog is
not procurable. As all three birds are such as feed upon corpses, it
seems probable that the rule as to their utility was intended to prevent
<span id="page_247">p. 247</span> any neglect of corpses found in wild
places, where some of these birds would be sure to approach and let
their shadows fall upon the dead. after which the finder of the corpse
would suppose that the Nasû*s* was destroyed or driven away, and the
corpse safer to approach.

<span id="fn_1249"></span>[247:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1256.md) This is an
exceptional case, when not more than two men are available; the usual
custom (see Chap. X, 10) is to employ four men and two dogs (double the
usual number) in disposing of the corpse of a pregnant woman, on account
of the double risk of contamination, owing to the Nasû*s*, or fiend of
corruption, having seized upon two corpses at once. In consequence of
the exceptional nature of the case, the mode of purification is also
exceptional.

<span id="fn_1250"></span>[247:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1257.md) A long
purification ceremony lasting nine nights, and described in Vend. IX,
1-145. Its name, according to Dastûr Hoshangji, is derived from the
first word of the instructions for sprinkling the unclean person, which
commence (Vend. IX, 48) as follows: Bareshnûm hê vaghdhanem paourum
paiti-hi*nk*ôi*s*, 'sprinkle in, front on the top of his head.' As it is
usual to quote chapters by their initial words, the initial word of
these instructions for the ceremony became a name for the ceremony
itself.

<span id="fn_1251"></span>[247:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1258.md) The building in
which the dead are finally deposited; here called by its Huzvâri*s*
name, khazân. The Dakhmas used by the Parsis in India are like low
circular towers in external appearance, and consist of a high wall
enclosing a larger or smaller circular space which is open to the sky.
The only opening in the wall is a small doorway, closed with an iron
door. In the centre of the circular area is a circular well a few feet
in depth, and the space around it is paved so as to slope gently
downwards from the enclosing wall to the brink of the well. This paved
annular area is divided (by shallow gutters grooved into its surface)
into spaces, each large enough for one corpse to be laid, upon it, with
the head towards the wall and the feet towards the well. These spaces
are arranged in two or more concentric rings around the well, and the
gutters (which isolate each space on all four sides) drain into the
<span id="page_248">p. 248</span> well. After a sufficient time has
elapsed the dry bones are said to be thrown into the well, and when the
well is full the Dakhma ought to be finally closed, and another one
brought into use. These Dakhmas are erected upon some dry and barren
spot, remote from habitations and water; upon the summit of a hill, if
possible, as prescribed in Vend. VI, 93, and usually more than a mile
from the town. In Bombay the town has gradually approached the Dakhmas,
and to some extent surrounded them, but has been kept away from their
immediate vicinity by the judicious measures of influential Parsis, who
have acquired all the neighbouring land, and refrain from building on
it. The reason for thus exposing their dead to the sun and carnivorous
birds is that the Parsis consider fire, water, and earth too sacred to
be defiled by corpses; and they have less consideration for the air.
Next to burning, the Parsi mode of disposing of the dead is the most
rapid and effectual, as it avoids most of the concentrated evils which
must accumulate in crowded cemeteries in the course of time, and which
require ages to dissipate. As it is, most of the offensive effluvium in
the immediate vicinity of a Dakhma arises not from direct contamination
of the air, but indirectly through the ground, which becomes polluted,
in the course of time, by impure filtrations.

<span id="fn_1252"></span>[248:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1259.md) Dastûr Jâmâspji
prefers reading patôshak, and thinks it means 'necessity,' as in cases
where two deaths occur nearly simultaneously in the same house, when
both corpses cannot be removed the same day. Such a meaning might suit
this passage, but the word occurs again, in § 33 and Chap. IX, 7, where
it can refer only to 'contamination,' and the etymology of pa*d*vîshak
(Av. paiti + vish) is plain enough.

<span id="fn_1253"></span>[248:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1260.md) That is, when two
persons cannot be found to carry a corpse, one can do it alone, provided
he holds a dog by a string. This course is adopted, Dastûr Jâmâspji
says, when a person happens to die in a place where only one Parsi is
available.

<span id="fn_1254"></span>[249:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1261.md) In the terms
a*v*î-dashtânŏ and a*v*î-nasâî the compound a*v* is written in an
obsolete manner, both in M6 and K20. The meaning of the text is that
either or both of the corpse-carriers may be any Parsi man, woman, or
child who understands the proper precautions. Compare Pahl. Vend. VIII,
28.

<span id="fn_1255"></span>[249:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1262.md) K20 has 'when
curved it is not to be carried.'

<span id="fn_1256"></span>[249:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1263.md) That is, it is a
mortal sin to allow rain to fall upon a corpse before it is deposited in
the Dakhma.

<span id="fn_1257"></span>[249:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1264.md) Or 'withheld,' or
'continuous,' according as we compare hâmûn with Pers. âmûn (âman),
amân, or hâmân.

<span id="fn_1258"></span>[249:5](sbe0562.htm#fr_1265.md) Inside the Dakhma
apparently. The meaning seems to be, that when the Dakhma is flooded the
corpse is to be laid down in some dry place in its vicinity until the
flood has abated. But according to Pahl. Vend. VIII, 17, it is allowable
to throw the corpse in when the Dakhma is full of water.

<span id="fn_1259"></span>[249:6](sbe0562.htm#fr_1266.md) See Chaps. I, 3,
II, 1. Here, again, the quotation must be from his complete commentary,
as it is not extant in the present Pahlavi Vendidad.

<span id="fn_1260"></span>[249:7](sbe0562.htm#fr_1267.md) From Av. var, 'to
cover, to shelter;' compare Pers. gullah, 'a bower or shed.' Nowadays
the Parsis have a permanent shelter near the Dakhma. Pahl. Vend. VIII,
17 says, 'to carry <span id="page_250">p. 250</span> an umbrella
(a*v*argash) from behind, *or* to hold up a shelter, is of no use.'

<span id="fn_1261"></span>[250:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1268.md) Or, 'it would
make *it* very dry,' if we read a*v*îr, 'very,' instead of a*g*îr,
'below;' these two words being written alike in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_1262"></span>[250:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1269.md) Quoting again
from his lost commentary.

<span id="fn_1263"></span>[250:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1270.md) Or, perhaps,
'floor.'

<span id="fn_1264"></span>[250:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1271.md) This translation
is somewhat doubtful, but the text seems to imply that the ground is
polluted as deep as it contains no water.

<span id="fn_1265"></span>[250:5](sbe0562.htm#fr_1272.md) K20 has had, 'the
stone is all polluted, *and* will become clean at the time when they dig
*it* up, the stone is all polluted, in so <span id="page_251">p.
251</span> much space as the corpse occupied *it is* polluted;' but the
additional matter seems to be struck out. Something analogous to the
details in this paragraph will be found in Pahl. Vend. VI, 9.

<span id="fn_1266"></span>[251:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1273.md) This section
would be more appropriate in Chap. III.

<span id="fn_1267"></span>[251:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1274.md) Or 'an upper
floor;' Pahl. Vend. VI, 9 has, 'when he shall die on an upper floor,
when nothing of him remains behind at the partitions (pardakân), the
floor is polluted as far as the balcony (â*s*kûp) *and* the balcony
alone is clean; when anything of him remains behind at the partitions,
the floor is polluted as far as the balcony, the ground is polluted as
far as the water, *about* the balcony alone it is not clear.'

<span id="fn_1268"></span>[251:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1275.md) See note on Chap.
III, 32.

<span id="fn_1269"></span>[251:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1276.md) The gâm, 'step,'
being 2 feet 7½ inches (see note on Bund. XXVI, 3) these thirty steps
are about 79 English feet.

<span id="fn_1270"></span>[251:5](sbe0562.htm#fr_1277.md) Meaning
uncertain; the word looks like Huzvâri*s*, but it is possible to read
rî*d*-aê instead of rîtâ-1.

<span id="fn_1271"></span>[252:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1278.md) That is, the
floor of the apartment; which would probably be formed of earth beaten
down, which, in India, is nearly always overspread with diluted cow-dung
to hinder cracks in the smooth surface. A better class of floor is
spread with lime plaster on a stony surface.

<span id="fn_1272"></span>[252:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1279.md) The object of
these rules is evidently to avoid disturbing the corpse more than is
absolutely necessary, provided there be no fear of its polluting more of
the ground by falling upon it.

<span id="fn_1273"></span>[253:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1280.md) K20 has a portion
of § 30 inserted here by mistake.

<span id="fn_1274"></span>[253:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1281.md) The object of
these rules is likewise to prevent the risk of the corpse defiling more
of the ground than is absolutely necessary by falling upon it, as it
might do by the breaking of a dead branch.

<span id="fn_1275"></span>[253:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1282) Nasâî (Av. nasu.md)
means not only a corpse or carcase of a human being, dog, or other
animal of the good creation, but also any portion of such corpse or
carcase; that is, *solid* 'dead matter' in general, as distinguished
from dirt or refuse from the living body, or any *liquid* exudation from
a corpse or carcase, which is called hîkhar (Av. hikhra).

<span id="fn_1276"></span>[253:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1283.md) Pahl. Vend. VI, 9
states, that 'when *one* shall die on a jar of wine, the jar is useless,
and the wine becomes just as though *its* <span id="page_254">p.
254</span> course (ravi*s*n) had been within three steps *of the
corpse*. And when he shall die in the wine, when nothing of him remains
behind on the jar, the jar is proper on making *it* dry' (or, perhaps,
'the jar is fit for bran-flour').

<span id="fn_1277"></span>[254:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1284.md) Or 'clarified
butter;' in this case the 'jar' is probably a globular vessel, or
carboy, made of hide, through which the oil, or liquid butter,
penetrates so far as to keep the outer surface greasy, which accounts
for the remark about the oil passing in and out. Such vessels, called
*d*abar, are commonly used for oil and liquid butter in India.

<span id="fn_1278"></span>[254:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1285.md) Assuming that
khû*s*kar stands for khû*s*k-kar, as it does in Pahl. Vend., VI, 71;
otherwise we should have to read thus: 'and the jar is mot even fit to
put any bran-flour in.'

<span id="fn_1279"></span>[254:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1286.md) Again assuming as
in § 32; otherwise we must read thus: 'but is fit for bran-flour
(khû*s*kar).'

<span id="fn_1280"></span>[255:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1287.md) Or 'a corpse;'
K20 has 'stands upon.' The meaning is that these substances do not
communicate the contamination throughout their own substance, but only
downwards to the ground, which conveys it farther down, so far as it
contains no water.

<span id="fn_1281"></span>[255:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1288.md) That is, these
substances communicate the contamination throughout their own substance,
but not down to the ground.

<span id="fn_1282"></span>[255:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1289.md) The verb
vi*d*ar*d*anŏ (Huz. vabrûntanŏ), 'to cross over, to pass away' (Av, vi +
tar, Pers. guDHa*s*tan), can only be used when referring to the death of
*good* people or animals; but the verb mûr*d*anŏ (Huz. yemîtûntanŏ), 'to
die, to expire' (Av. mar, Pers. murdan), can be used generally, though
usually applied to the wicked and to evil creatures. Pahl. Vend. V, 134
contains nearly the same text as §§ 38, 39.

<span id="fn_1283"></span>[255:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1290.md) Under ordinary
circumstances fire must not be brought within thirty steps, or about 79
English feet, of a corpse (see Vend. VIII, <span id="page_256">p.
256</span> 17). But the spirit of the Mazdayasnian law is reasonable,
and, although strict, it allows for practical difficulties and chooses
the least of two evils in a more judicious manner than might be expected
(a fact which it would be well for Parsis and others to observe in
doubtful cases). Here, breaking through the wall of a house is
considered a greater evil than the possible pollution of the fire by
passing at a distance of three steps, or eight English feet, from a
corpse.

<span id="fn_1284"></span>[256:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1291.md) The name of a
commentator, or commentary, often quoted in Pahlavi translations (see,
the note on Chap. I, 4).

<span id="fn_1285"></span>[256:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1292.md) Literally,
'destroying the consciousness,' or 'injuring the existence.' Bô*d*ôzê*d*
or bô*d*yôza*d* is a particular kind of sin which appears to consist
chiefly of the ill-treatment of animals and injury of useful property.
It is mentioned in Pahl. Yas. XXIX, 1b, Pahl. Vend. V, 107, XIII, 38,
Farh. Okh. pp. 32, 33; and in some editions of the Khurdah Avesta it is
defined as selling stolen men or animals into misery, or one's own
domestic cattle to the butcher, also spoiling and tearing up good
clothing, or wasting and spoiling good food.

<span id="fn_1286"></span>[256:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1293.md) The meaning is,
that if it became necessary to break through the wall in order to remove
the fire unpolluted, the sin committed through damaging the wall will
not be punished either in this world or the next.

<span id="fn_1287"></span>[256:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1294.md) That is, nearer
than three steps, which is considered to be the minimum distance at
which any degree of purity can be maintained.

<span id="fn_1288"></span>[256:5](sbe0562.htm#fr_1295.md) A marg-ar*g*ân
sin, on committing which the sinner is required to place his life at the
disposal of the high-priest (see Chap. VIII, 2, 5, 6, 21). It is usually
considered equivalent to fifteen Tanâpûhars (see Chap. I, 1, 2).

<span id="fn_1289"></span>[257:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1296.md) According to the
season of the year, the period of uncleanness being nine nights in the
five winter months, and a month in the seven summer months (see Vend. V,
129).

<span id="fn_1290"></span>[257:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1297.md) Av. zaothra; this
holy-water is consecrated by the priest reciting certain prayers while
holding the empty metal cups in his hands, while filling them with
water, and after filling them (see Haug's Essays, p. 397).

<span id="fn_1291"></span>[257:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1298.md) The Av. gâu*s*
*g*îvya, '*product of* the living cow,' which is kept in a metal saucer
during the ceremonies, and used for sprinkling the sacred twigs
(baresôm), and for mixing with the holy-water and Hôm-juice in the
mortar (see Haug's Essays, pp. 403, 405, 06).

<span id="fn_1292"></span>[257:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1299.md) Compare Pers.
*k*ûm, 'fat;' it is the Av. gâu*s* hudh*a*u, '*product of* the
well-yielding cow,' a small piece of which is placed upon one of the
sacred pancakes, or wafers (drôn), during the ceremonies (see Haug's
Essays, pp. 396, 407).

<span id="fn_1293"></span>[257:5](sbe0562.htm#fr_1300.md) Reading ya*s*t;
but it may be ga*s*t, 'changed.'

<span id="fn_1294"></span>[257:6](sbe0562.htm#fr_1301.md) See the note on
Chap. I, 4.

<span id="fn_1295"></span>[257:7](sbe0562.htm#fr_1302.md) There appear to
be, as yet, no means of ascertaining the name of the writer of the
Shâyast lâ-shâyast, who gives his own opinion here.

<span id="fn_1296"></span>[258:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1303.md) Literally, 'the
vault of the fires of Vâhrâm.' Pahl. Vend. V, 134 says 'the vault of the
fires is *liable* just like an empty house.' Both this section and § 49
seem out of place.

<span id="fn_1297"></span>[258:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1304.md) See Pahl. Vend.
V, 134.

<span id="fn_1298"></span>[258:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1305.md) Literally, 'the
produce of the fire of Vâhrâm,' a term for 'ashes,' which is used in
Pahl. Vend. V, 150 along with the equivalent phrase, 'clothing of the
fire' (see Chap. III, 27).

<span id="fn_1299"></span>[258:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1306.md) See Chap. I, 1, 2
for the degrees of sin mentioned in §§ 50, 51, 53.

<span id="fn_1300"></span>[259:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1308.md) That is, the
ceremonial ablution (pâ*d*îyâ*v*îh), or 'washing, with water, the hands
and arms up to the elbows, the face as far as behind the ears, and the
feet up to the ankles,' whilst a certain form of prayer is recited (see
AV. p. 148, note).

<span id="fn_1301"></span>[259:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1309.md) Here again, as in
§ 38, the strict letter of the law is relaxed in case of necessity.

<span id="fn_1302"></span>[259:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1310.md) Meaning,
apparently, that any pollution is taken into account, as a sin, in the
investigation the soul has to undergo upon entering the other world.
Much of this paragraph will be found in Pahl. Vend. V, 107.

<span id="fn_1303"></span>[259:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1311.md) Referring to
Vend. V, 82-107, which gives an account of the number of persons through
whom the pollution of a corpse or carcase will pass, which is in
proportion to the importance of the dead individual. The statement here
made is that the infection, passing from one to the other, enters each
person only on one side, but the demon of corruption attacks them on all
sides.

<span id="fn_1304"></span>[259:5](sbe0562.htm#fr_1312.md) Meaning,
probably, the Nasû*s*, or demon of corruption (see § 1 who is said to
rush upon all those polluted as detailed in Vend. V, 82-107.

<span id="fn_1305"></span>[259:6](sbe0562.htm#fr_1313.md) See Chap. I, 3.

<span id="fn_1306"></span>[259:7](sbe0562.htm#fr_1314.md) That is, until
seen by the dog the corpse remains pervaded by the demon of corruption
and hazardous to approach (see §§ 1-4).

<span id="fn_1307"></span>[260:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1315.md) See Chap. I, 4,
note. This name is nearly always written Kushtanŏ-bû*g*ê*d* in Sls. in
K20 and M6; it is not mentioned in Pahl. Vend. II, 107, although the
details here quoted are there given in part.

<span id="fn_1308"></span>[260:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1316.md) The meaning is
not quite clear, but this sentence is probably to be read in connection
with the preceding one, as implying that where such domestic animals are
kept they can be used for stopping the infection, as effectually as any
inanimate object. The pig is here mentioned as a common domestic animal,
but Parsis have long since adopted the prejudices of Hindus and
Muhammadans as regards the uncleanness of the pig.

<span id="fn_1309"></span>[260:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1317.md) As Vend. V,
108-112 says the same of the dog urupi, it would seem that the writer of
our text considered the urupi to be a hedgehog (zûzak); the Pahlavi
translation of the Vendidad renders it by rapuk or rîpûk, which appears
to be merely an approximate transcript of the Avesta word;
traditionally, this is read raspûk and compared with Pers. râsû,
'ichneumon;' its identification with the hedgehog is certainly doubtful,
although it appears to be admitted in Pahl. Vend. V, 112, where the same
words are used as in this section.

<span id="fn_1310"></span>[260:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1318.md) The technical
terms hamrê*d* and paîtrê*d*, for contagion and infection, are merely
corruptions of Av. hãm-raêthwayêiti and paiti-raêthwayêiti. The
definition of the latter one is omitted in K20 by mistake.

<span id="fn_1311"></span>[261:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1319.md) Reading amat,
'when,' instead of mûn, 'which' (see note to Bund. I, 7).

<span id="fn_1312"></span>[261:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1320.md) Vend. V, 86, 87
limits the pollution to the eleventh person infected, in the extreme
case of the corpse having been a priest; but Pahl. Vend. V, 107 quotes
the opinion of Sôshâns that until a dog has gazed at the corpse the
pollution extends to the twelfth, but only the first ten require the
ceremonial purification of the bareshnûm, the others being cleansed by
ordinary washing with bull's urine and water.

<span id="fn_1313"></span>[261:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1321.md) Pahl. Vend. V,
107 states, however, that 'everything of the ape (kapîk) is just like
mankind.' The meaning of § 61 is very uncertain, as the text can be both
read and translated several ways, and none of them are very
satisfactory.

<span id="fn_1314"></span>[261:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1322.md) That is, in the
case of the shepherd's dog (see Vend. V, 92, 93); the carcases of other
dogs occasion the indirect pollution of fewer persons, in proportion to
their inferior importance; but Pahl. Vend. V, 107 states, with regard to
this importance, that when 'in doubt, every man is to be considered as a
priest, and every dog as a shepherd's dog,' so as to be on the safe
side, by exacting, the maximum amount of purification in all doubtful
cases.

<span id="fn_1315"></span>[261:5](sbe0562.htm#fr_1323.md) The Pahlavi text
leaves it doubtful whether the place, the people, or the carcase becomes
clean, but the first is the most probable.

<span id="fn_1316"></span>[262:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1324.md) That is, he has
committed a sin equivalent to three mortal sins (marg-ar*g*ân).

<span id="fn_1317"></span>[262:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1325.md) Reading ve*s* as
equivalent to vê*s*.

<span id="fn_1318"></span>[262:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1326.md) Reading râkhtakîh
(compare Pers. rakhtah, 'sick, wounded').

<span id="fn_1319"></span>[262:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1327.md) This opinion of
Afarg (see Chap. I, 3) is also quoted in Pahl. Vend. III, 48.

<span id="fn_1320"></span>[262:5](sbe0562.htm#fr_1328.md) This statement is
repeated in Chap. X, 33.

<span id="fn_1321"></span>[262:6](sbe0562.htm#fr_1329.md) That is, with the
Bareshnûm ceremony.

<span id="fn_1322"></span>[262:7](sbe0562.htm#fr_1330.md) This exception
(which is repeated in §§ 68, 71) seems to imply that §§ 66, 68, 71 refer
to the collection of any fragments of a corpse found in the wilderness,
or in water; and the exemption from the troublesome purification
ceremony in such cases, is probably intended to encourage people to
undertake the disagreeable duty of attending to such fragments.

<span id="fn_1323"></span>[263:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1331.md) The interposition
of the stake, or piece of wood, prevents the direct attack of the
Nasû*s*, or demon of corruption, which has not been driven away by a
dog. That inanimate objects are supposed to stop the progress of the
pollution appears from § 57.

<span id="fn_1324"></span>[263:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1332.md) See Chap. I, 1,
2. A sin is figuratively said to take root in the body, when it has to
be eradicated, or figuratively dug up.

<span id="fn_1325"></span>[263:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1333.md) See § 68. If he
employs another man to move the corpse merely because he is physically
unable to do it himself, he escapes with less pollution than when he is
able to do the work himself; but the man employed suffers the same in
both cases.

<span id="fn_1326"></span>[263:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1334.md) See Chap. I, 1,
2.

<span id="fn_1327"></span>[263:5](sbe0562.htm#fr_1335.md) See § 66.

<span id="fn_1328"></span>[264:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1336.md) Literally, 'when
I came by;' the usual Persian idiom in such phrases.

<span id="fn_1329"></span>[264:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1337.md) This statement of
Afarg's, so far as it relates to greasy firewood, will be found in Pahl.
Vend. V, 14.

<span id="fn_1330"></span>[264:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1338.md) Or, 'by the
community.' The same rule is mentioned in Pahl. Vend. V, 14.

<span id="fn_1331"></span>[264:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1339.md) There is some
uncertainty about this word. It is not the Pers. badtum, 'worst,
vilest,' because that is written va*d*tûm or vatûm in Pahlavi; besides,
the rule must apply to other than the vilest doors, otherwise it would
not harmonize with § 75. It is not a miswriting of nîtûm, 'lowest, most
debased,' for the same reason, and because it occurs elsewhere. It is
not a miswriting of bêtman, a possible variant of bêtâ, 'a house'
(although 'a house-door' would suit the context very well), because it
occurs also in Pahl. Vend. V, 14, XI, 10, in which latter place it is
clearly an adjective partially translating Av. b*e*ndvô. And it would be
hazardous to connect it with Pers. bîdûn, 'outside,' which seems merely
a corruption or misreading of bîrûn. The view taken here is that badtûm
stands for bandtûm, 'most shut up,' the nasal being often dropped in
Pahlavi, as in sag for sang, 'stone,' &c.

<span id="fn_1337"></span>[265:6](sbe0562.htm#fr_1345.md) That is, the
pollution extends about eight English feet up-stream and upwards,
sixteen feet sideways and downwards, and twenty-four feet down-stream.
Some of the latter part of the sentence is omitted in K20 by mistake.

<span id="fn_1338"></span>[266:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1346.md) The sentence is
obscure, but this seems to be the meaning; that is, when a corpse or any
dead matter is thrown into a pond or tank, the pollution extends sixteen
feet from it in all directions; and that quantity of water ought to be
drawn off, in order to purify the tank (see Vend. VI, 65-71). As the
corpse, in nearly all cases, must be either at the bottom or on the
surface, the quantity of polluted water to be drawn off must be a
hemispherical mass sixteen feet in radius, or about forty-eight tons of
water.

<span id="fn_1339"></span>[266:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1347.md) See Pahl. Vend.

Tanâpûhar, and leaving it is a sin of the same amount.

<span id="fn_1341"></span>[266:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1349.md) Reading amat,

water may be polluted by the corpse taking the shortest route through
it; but if that be impossible it must come out quickly, at any rate.

<span id="fn_1347"></span>[267:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1355.md) That is, the
otherwise indispensable dog's gaze and two bearers must be dispensed
with, if not at hand, in order to save time, until the corpse is out of
the water (see § 85).

<span id="fn_1348"></span>[267:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1356.md) It might be,
'there was a man *who* said,' but Mar*d*-bû*d* occurs in the Nîrangistân
as the name of a commentator (see Chap. I, 4, note).

<span id="fn_1349"></span>[267:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1357.md) See Pahl. Vend.
VI, 64 for this prohibition.

<span id="fn_1350"></span>[268:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1360.md) See Chap. I, 3.

<span id="fn_1351"></span>[268:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1359.md) Or 'fear.' The
difference of opinion between the two commentators on this question in
casuistry, appears to have arisen from Afarg regarding the water merely
as the representative of a spirit, who might be endangered or frightened
by the source of impurity becoming more visible when above the water,
while Mê*d*ôk-mâh considered the water in its material aspect, and
wished to save it from the further pollution consequent upon drawing the
corpse through more of it.

<span id="fn_1352"></span>[268:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1361.md) See Pahl. Vend.
VI, 64.

<span id="fn_1353"></span>[268:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1362.md) These rules
generally distinguish clearly between offences committed 'through
sinfulness,' that is, wilfully, and those arising from accidental
inability; more stress being laid upon the intention than upon the
action.

<span id="fn_1354"></span>[269:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1363.md) See Pahl. Vend.
VI, 64 for §§ 92, 93.

<span id="fn_1355"></span>[269:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1364.md) Or 'twisted off;'
the Huz. neskhûntanŏ must be traced to Chald. ‏נְסַח‎ 'to pluck out, to
tear away,' and seems to have a similar meaning in Pahlavi; its Paz.
equivalent vîkhtanŏ (Av. vi*g*) ought to be compared rather with Pers.
kîkhtan, 'to bruise or break,' than with bêkhtan or pêkhtan, 'to twist.'

<span id="fn_1356"></span>[269:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1365.md) This negative is
omitted in M6 by mistake.

<span id="fn_1357"></span>[269:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1366.md) Compare Pahl.
Vend. VII, 32.

<span id="fn_1358"></span>[269:5](sbe0562.htm#fr_1367.md) Or 'go to
pieces;' that this is the meaning of vishûpênd appears clearly from
Pahl. Vend. VII, 123, but a Persian gloss in the modern MS. M9 explains
it as 'deposit fragments from the beak of a bird,' meaning, of course,
fragments of dead matter dropped by a carrion bird.

<span id="fn_1359"></span>[269:6](sbe0562.htm#fr_1368.md) As useless, being
incapable of purification; such cuttings are to be buried, according to
the Avesta of Vend. VII, 32, though the Pahlavi commentary explains that
they are to be thrown away.

<span id="fn_1360"></span>[270:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1369.md) Khshvâ*s*-mâûgôk
is merely a corruption of the Av. khshva*s* m*a*unghô, 'six months,' of
Vend. VII, 36, where this form of cleansing is thus described: 'If (the
clothing) be woven, they should wash *it* out six times with bull's
urine, they should scour *it* six times with earth, they should wash
*it* out six times with water, they should fumigate *it* six months at
the window of the house.'

<span id="fn_1361"></span>[270:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1370.md) See Pahl. Vend.
VII, 3 2.

<span id="fn_1362"></span>[270:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1371.md) That is; woven
clothing, as declared in Vend. VII, 36 (quoted above in note 1).

<span id="fn_1363"></span>[270:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1372.md) See Vend. VII,
35.

<span id="fn_1364"></span>[270:5](sbe0562.htm#fr_1373.md) A Persian gloss
defines armê*s*t as 'a woman who has brought forth a dead child,' and
this is the general opinion; but that seems to be only a particular
example of an unclean person who would be included under the general
term armê*s*t, for according to Pahl. Vend. IX, 133, 137, 141 a man when
only partially purified must remain apart in the place for the armê*s*t
(Av. airima, compare Sans. il or rî) for a certain time. Nêryôsang, in
his Sanskrit translation of Mkh. (XXXVII, 36, XXXIX, 40, LI, 7),
explains armê*s*t as 'lame, crippled, immobility;' it also means
'stagnant,' when applied to water; and its primitive signification was,
probably, 'most stationary' an appropriate term for such unclean persons
as are required to remain in a particular place apart from all others,
as well as for helpless cripples, and insane persons under restraint
(see Chap. VI, x). The meaning 'most polluted' would hardly apply to
tank water.

<span id="fn_1365"></span>[271:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1374.md) Pahl. Vend. VII,
35 says 'when a single hair is on it.'

<span id="fn_1366"></span>[271:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1375.md) As mentioned in a
note on § 95.

<span id="fn_1367"></span>[271:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1376.md) Literally,
'impinges.' Here, as in many other places, 'dead matter' may be read
instead of 'corpse,' as nasâî means both or either of them.

<span id="fn_1368"></span>[271:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1377.md) That is, laid
upon wool.

<span id="fn_1369"></span>[271:5](sbe0562.htm#fr_1378.md) See § 101.

<span id="fn_1370"></span>[271:6](sbe0562.htm#fr_1379.md) See Pahl. Vend.
VII, 27.

<span id="fn_1371"></span>[272:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1380.md) That is, she
cannot be purified.

<span id="fn_1372"></span>[272:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1381.md) Reading var (see
note on § 49).

<span id="fn_1373"></span>[272:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1382.md) Carrying a corpse
by a single person being prohibited (see §§ 7, 8); but why he is
supposed to devour it is not clear.

<span id="fn_1374"></span>[272:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1383.md) See Chap. I, 4,
note.

<span id="fn_1375"></span>[272:5](sbe0562.htm#fr_1384.md) Compare Pahl.
Vend. VII, 192.

<span id="fn_1376"></span>[273:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1385.md) The purification
here detailed is prescribed for golden vessels in Vend. VII, 186.

<span id="fn_1377"></span>[273:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1386.md) This is the
purification prescribed for silver vessels in Vend. VII, 74 W.; it is
found in the Vendidad Sâdah, but is omitted (evidently by mistake) in
the Vendidad with Pahlavi translation, and has, therefore, been omitted
in Spiegel's edition of the texts. By this accidental omission in the
MSS. silver is connected with the purification for stone (see § 114).

<span id="fn_1378"></span>[273:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1387.md) See Vend. VII, 75
W., much of which is omitted in the Vendidad with Pahlavi translation,
and in Spiegel's edition (see the preceding note), the sixfold washing
of stone being erroneously applied to silver (see Vend. VII, 187 Sp.),
owing to this omission of the intervening text. It appears from this
section that the AV. haosafna, which has usually been translated as
'copper,' was understood to be pûlâ*vd*, 'steel,' by the Pahlavi
translators.

<span id="fn_1379"></span>[273:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1388.md) Or 'a mirror'
(Pers. âbgînah), but the word is evidently used for a metal in SZS. X,
2, and very likely here also.

<span id="fn_1380"></span>[273:5](sbe0562.htm#fr_1389.md) Most of the
substances mentioned in §§ 115, 116 are detailed in Pahl. Vend. VII,
188, where it is stated that 'as to the pearl *there* have been
different opinions, some say that it is *liable* just like gold, some
say that it is just like the other jewels, *and* some say that there is
no washing *for it*.'

<span id="fn_1381"></span>[274:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1390.md) This is doubtful;
the word can be read pirînak, and has the Pers. gloss pîrûzah,
'turquoise,' in some MSS. If read pilînak it might perhaps be taken for
'ivory.' But in Pahl. Vend. VII, 188 it is vafarinô, 'snowy,' and the
reading there seems to be 'jet-black *and* snow-white stone-coral;' so
here the original meaning may have been 'snow-white, and jet-black
coral-stone.'

<span id="fn_1382"></span>[274:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1391.md) Vend. VII, 188
says that 'earthen or wooden or porcelain *vessels* are impure for
everlasting.'

<span id="fn_1383"></span>[274:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1392.md) Meaning,
apparently, that they cannot be purified for immediate use.

<span id="fn_1384"></span>[274:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1393.md) That is,
one-sixth longer than when green, the vitast being twelve
finger-*breadths*, or nine inches (see Bund. XXVI, 3, note). The
purification of firewood, here prescribed, is simply drying it for a
year in short lengths; but Vend. VII, 72-82 requires it also to be
sprinkled once with water, and to be cut into longer pieces.

<span id="fn_1385"></span>[274:5](sbe0562.htm#fr_1394.md) See Chap. I, 3.

<span id="fn_1386"></span>[274:6](sbe0562.htm#fr_1395.md) See Chap. I, 4,
note.

<span id="fn_1387"></span>[275:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1396.md) Something similar
is said in Pahl. Vend. VI, 71.

<span id="fn_1388"></span>[275:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1397.md) According to
Vend. VII, 83-93 polluted corn and fodder are to be treated like
polluted firewood, but to be cut into pieces of about double the length.

<span id="fn_1389"></span>[275:3](sbe0562.htm#fr_1398.md) Reading dên gôpân
farôstak; the practice of storing corn in dry pits underground is common
in the East and in some parts of Europe. In Pahl. Vend. VII, 93 it is
den gôpân âvist, 'concealed in pits.'

<span id="fn_1390"></span>[275:4](sbe0562.htm#fr_1399.md) See Chap. I, 3.

<span id="fn_1391"></span>[275:5](sbe0562.htm#fr_1400.md) Pahl. Vend. VII,
93 classes the almond with the walnut as a connected fruit and the date
with the pomegranate as a separated one.

<span id="fn_1392"></span>[275:6](sbe0562.htm#fr_1401.md) The word is
kûrâpak or kûrâ*z*ak, but its meaning is doubtful.

<span id="fn_1393"></span>[276:1](sbe0562.htm#fr_1402.md) Pahl. Vend. VII,
9 3 says, 'fruit whose rind (pazâ*v*) exists is also just like that in a
pod (kûvak), and *for* that which does not remain in a rind, when
*pollution* shall come upon it, *there* is no *cleansing* whatever.
Afarg said that *there* is ever a rind (pazâ*v*i*s*nŏ) with the citron.'

<span id="fn_1394"></span>[276:2](sbe0562.htm#fr_1403.md) Pahl. Vend. VII,
93 says, '*for* everything separated *there* is a washing, except meat
*and* milk.' Articles for which there is no washing cannot be purified.
