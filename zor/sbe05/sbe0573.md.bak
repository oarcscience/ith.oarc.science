### CHAPTER XIII.

0\. The signification of the Gâthas <span
id="fr_1760"></span>[9](#fn_1748.md).

1\. These three Ashem-vohûs (Yas. XI, end) which

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

*represent* <span id="fr_1761"></span>[1](#fn_1749.md) the Fravarânê (Yas.
XI, end) of the preliminary ritual (pê*s* nîrang) and the rotation of
these three Hâs ('chapters'), the Fravarânê, Frastuyê, and
Âstuyê—fravarânê *being* the beginning of the Fravarânê <span
id="fr_1762"></span>[2](#fn_1750.md) *which extends* as far as
frasastayaê*k*a <span id="fr_1763"></span>[3](#fn_1751.md), frastuyê <span
id="fr_1764"></span>[4](#fn_1752.md), the beginning of the Frastuyê (Yas.
XII, I-XIII, 26) *which extends* up to the Âstuyê, and âstuyê <span
id="fr_1765"></span>[5](#fn_1753.md), the beginning of the
Âstaothwanem <span id="fr_1766"></span>[6](#fn_1754.md), (Yas. XIII,
27-XIV, end) *which extends* as far as âstaothwanem*k*â daênay*a*u
Mâzdayasnôi*s*—*also represent* the Vîsâi-v*e*-ameshâ-spe*n*tâ (Yas.
XV), *which is* the beginning of the Stôtânyasnô ('the ritual of
praisers') <span id="fr_1767"></span>[7](#fn_1755.md), and these three Hâs
of the Baghãm (Yas. XIX-XXI).

2\. In the exposition (*k*ashî*d*ak) and through the

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

evidence of revelation (dînô) the wise of those of the primitive
faith <span id="fr_1768"></span>[1](#fn_1756.md) *have* thus said, that a
man of fifteen years <span id="fr_1769"></span>[2](#fn_1757.md), and a son
and, brother of Mazdayasnians—when he confesses *his* failings (mândak)
to the high-priests (ra*d*ân), and they shall bring him the whip and
scourge <span id="fr_1770"></span>[3](#fn_1758.md), and these five
Gâthas <span id="fr_1771"></span>[4](#fn_1759.md) are chanted and the good
waters consecrated by him, and the whole of the renewed-birth *ceremony*
(navî*d*-zâ*d*îh) <span id="fr_1772"></span>[5](#fn_1760.md) is performed
by him—*becomes* a mature youth and not a child, and a share of the
prayers of initiation (nâpar) and of the fires is to be given over to
him <span id="fr_1773"></span>[6](#fn_1761.md); and when thus much is not
performed by him, a share is not to be given. 3. These five <span
id="fr_1774"></span>[7](#fn_1762.md) Gâthas are made up from the body of a
righteous man.

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

4\. Ahyâ-yâsâ (Yas. XXVIII), Khshmaibyâ (Yas. XXIX), and A*d*-tâ-vakhshâ
(Yas. XXX) *have*, severally, eleven stanzas (va*k*êst), because eleven
things move spiritually within the bodies of men, as life,
consciousness, religion, soul, guardian spirit, thought, word, deed,
seeing, smelling, and hearing; and the bodies of men and other creatures
are formed of water, fire, and wind <span
id="fr_1775"></span>[1](#fn_1763.md).

5\. Ashem-Ahurem-mazdãm (Visp. XV) is *to be recited* <span
id="fr_1776"></span>[2](#fn_1764.md) three times before the coming of
Hûshê*d*ar, Hûshê*d*ar-mâh, and Sôshyans; and when they also recite the
chapter (hâ*d*) well, and by line (gâs) and stanza, those *apostles* are
present <span id="fr_1777"></span>[3](#fn_1765.md), and the

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

country becomes more flourishing and more dominant in the world.

6\. The twenty-two stanzas of Tâ-v*e*-urvâtâ (Yas. XXXI) are the
twenty-two judgments (dâ*d*istân) of which it speaks in the Hâ*d*ôkht
*Nask* <span id="fr_1778"></span>[1](#fn_1766.md) thus:—'Anaomô mananghê
daya vîspâi kva, kva parô?' (where are *they* to be produced beyond
every thought? *and* where before?') 'Lodging in the judge, that while
*he has* twenty-two judgments *he may be* more just;'—so that when they
pray the Tâ-v*e*-urvâtâ chapter well, and recite *it* by line and
stanza, the judges possess those twenty-two judgments more correctly,
and judiciousness is more lodging *in them*.

7\. The sixteen stanzas of the *Hv*aêtumaithi *chapter* (Yas.
XXXII) <span id="fr_1779"></span>[2](#fn_1767.md) are lodging in warriors,
so that it becomes possible, during their good protection, to force the
enemy *away* from those sixteen countries which the Vendidad <span
id="fr_1780"></span>[3](#fn_1768.md) mentions in *its* first fargar*d*.

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

8\. The fourteen stanzas of Yathâ-âi*s* (Yas. XXXIII) are for this
reason, because seven archangels are more diligent in activity *for* the
spirit, and seven archangels <span id="fr_1781"></span>[1](#fn_1769.md) for
the world, so that they may attain 'to heaven, the home (mêhônŏ) of
Aûharmazd, the home of the archangels, the home of those righteous
ones,' avi garô-nmânem, maêthanem Ahurahê mazd*a*u, maêthanem ameshanãm
spe*n*tanãm, maêthanem anyaêshãm ashaonãm <span
id="fr_1782"></span>[2](#fn_1770). 9. The three repetitions (dânar.md) of
Y*e*-s*e*vi*s*tô (Yas. XXXIII, 11) <span
id="fr_1783"></span>[3](#fn_1771.md), *and* the holding up of the
holy-water (zôhar) at these *repetitions*, are for the four
classes <span id="fr_1784"></span>[4](#fn_1772.md), and for this *reason*
at Ahurâi mazdâi *and* ashem*k*â frâda*d* <span
id="fr_1785"></span>[5](#fn_1773.md) the holy-water is

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

to be held level with the heart of him who is the officiating priest
(zôt), and at sraotâ <span id="fr_1786"></span>[1](#fn_1774.md) *it* is to
be held level with the arm of him who is the officiating priest, so that
while the warriors are in battle with foreigners (anâîrân) they may be
fuller of breath (vayô-gîrtar), and the husbandmen stronger-armed in the
tillage and cultivation of the world.

10\. The fifteen stanzas of Yâ-*s*kyaothanâ (Yas. XXXIV) are for this
reason, because it is given <span id="fr_1787"></span>[2](#fn_1775.md) for
the destruction of those fifteen fiends who are disclosed in the medical
part (bêshâ*z*) of the Hâ*d*ôkht *Nask* <span
id="fr_1788"></span>[3](#fn_1776). 11. The four repetitions (bâr.md) of
Mazdâ-a*d*-môi (Yas. XXXIV, 15) <span id="fr_1789"></span>[4](#fn_1777.md)
are for the right coming on of the share of these five chieftainships
(ra*d*îh), the house-ruler, the village-ruler, the tribe-ruler, the
province-ruler, and the supreme Zaratû*s*t <span
id="fr_1790"></span>[5](#fn_1778.md).

12\. The two repetitions of Ahyâ-yâsâ (Yas. XVIII, 1) <span
id="fr_1791"></span>[6](#fn_1779.md), are for this reason, that the
sovereign (dahyûpat) may not at once seize body, consciousness,

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

and soul. 13. Those four Yathâ-ahû-vairyôs of the first *Gâtha* <span
id="fr_1792"></span>[1](#fn_1780.md) are for this reason, that is, so that
inferiors may become more tolerant of the commands of superiors, and
good thoughts, good words, and good deeds be more domesticated
(mâhmântar) in the world, and the fiend more powerless
(apâ*d*akhshâhtar).

14\. In short (aê-mar) <span id="fr_1793"></span>[2](#fn_1781.md),
Ahyâ-yâsâ is as (pavan) <span id="fr_1794"></span>[3](#fn_1782.md)
Aûharmazd and the righteous man, Khshmaibyâ as Vohûman and cattle,
A*d*-tâ-vakhshyâ as Ar*d*avahi*s*t and fire, Tâ-v*e*-urvâtâ as
Shatvaîrô <span id="fr_1795"></span>[4](#fn_1783.md) and metal, the
*Hv*aêtumaithi as the Gâtha of Spendarma*d* and the earth, Yatha-âi*s*
as Horvada*d* and water, and Yâ-*s*kyaothanâ as Amerôda*d* and plants.

15\. The progress which is in <span id="fr_1796"></span>[5](#fn_1784.md)
the Ahunavaiti Gâtha the house-rulers should carry on; that which is in
the U*s*tavaiti Gâtha the village-rulers should carry on; that which is
in the Spe*n*tâ-mainyû <span id="fr_1797"></span>[6](#fn_1785.md) Gâtha the
tribe-rulers should carry on; that which is in the Vohû-khshathra Gâtha
the province-rulers should carry on; that which is in the
Vahi*s*tô-i*s*ti Gathâ the supreme Zaratû*s*ts should carry on, and

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

that which is in the Yasna, which is the place of righteous
blessing <span id="fr_1798"></span>[1](#fn_1786.md), these four classes
themselves should carry on.

16\. Of the Yasna *of seven chapters* (Yas. XXXV-XLI, 17) the beginning
section (kar*d*akŏ) *has* nine stanzas; and its beginning <span
id="fr_1799"></span>[2](#fn_1787) is Humatanãm (Yas. XXXV, 4.md), and its
end is Humatanãm (Yas. XLI, 17 supl.)

17\. The six stanzas of Ahyâ-thwâ-âthrô (Yas, XXXVI) are owing to the
six hot ordeals (var) which, in the Hûspâram *Nask* <span
id="fr_1800"></span>[3](#fn_1788.md), are effected by *k*athrayâim
âthraiãm <span id="fr_1801"></span>[4](#fn_1789.md).

18\. The five stanzas of Ithâ-â*d*-yazamaidê (Yas. XXXVII) are
thanksgiving and praise for the production of the good creations by
Aûharmazd.

19\. The five stanzas of Imãm-âa*d*-zãm (Yas. XXXVIII) are owing to
those five comforts and five discomforts of the earth, which, it is
declared in the third fargar*d* in the Vendidad <span
id="fr_1802"></span>[5](#fn_1790.md) are accomplished

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

thus:—'The first comfort of the earth is from the land on which a
righteous man walks forth; the second is when they shall make the
dwelling of the good and fires upon it; the third is when they sow corn
upon it, and shall take heed of dead matter; the fourth is when all
beasts *of burden* are born upon it; the fifth is when every beast *of
burden* is on it <span id="fr_1803"></span>[1](#fn_1791.md); and its first
discomfort is from the Arezûr ridge <span
id="fr_1804"></span>[2](#fn_1792.md) and the gate of hell; the second is
when they dig <span id="fr_1805"></span>[3](#fn_1793.md) it up *for* a dead
*body*; the third is when *one* constructs a depository *for the dead*
(khazân) <span id="fr_1806"></span>[4](#fn_1794.md) upon it; the fourth is
from the holes of its noxious creatures; the fifth is when they shall
forsake a man in affliction (var*d*akîh) upon it, who is righteous.'

20\. The five stanzas of Ithâ (Yas. XXXIX) are just as those which *go*
before.

21\. The four stanzas of Âhû-a*d*-paiti (Yas. XL) are about the benefit
(ar*g*-hômandîh) which is on account of water, earth, plants, and
animals.

22\. The six stanzas of Stûtô-garô (Yas. XLI, 117), the two repetitions
of Humatanãm (Yas. XX XV, 4-6), *and* the three repetitions of
Hukhshathrôtemâi (Yas. XXXV, 13-15) are on account of the existence of
the sons of Zaratû*s*t <span id="fr_1807"></span>[5](#fn_1795.md).

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

23\. The two repetitions of Ashahyâ-âa*d*-sairi <span
id="fr_1808"></span>[1](#fn_1796) (Yas. XXXV, 22, 23.md) are for the
laudation of righteousness and the destruction of the fiend. 24. The two
repetitions of YêNhê-hâtãm <span id="fr_1809"></span>[2](#fn_1797.md) are
for the laudation of Aûharmazd and the archangels, and the destruction
of the evil spirit and the miscreations (vishû*d*akân). 25. *The two
repetitions of* <span id="fr_1810"></span>[3](#fn_1798.md)
Thwôistaotaras*k*â, (Yas. XLI, 12-14) are for the laudation of
ceremonial worship (ya*z*i*s*nŏ) and the *sacred* feast (mâzd).

26\. The two repetitions of Âtarem*k*a (Visp. XIX, 1-8) <span
id="fr_1811"></span>[4](#fn_1799.md) are for the laudation of the Frôbâk
fire and the fire Vâzi*s*t <span id="fr_1812"></span>[5](#fn_1800.md).

27\. Of the sixteen stanzas of the U*s*tavaiti *chapter* (Yas.
XLII) <span id="fr_1813"></span>[6](#fn_1801.md) it is related just as
about the *Hv*aêtumaithi *chapter* <span
id="fr_1814"></span>[7](#fn_1802.md).

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

28\. The twenty stanzas of Ta*d*-thwâ-peresâ (Yas. XLIII) are the twenty
judgments (dâ*d*istân) between the beneficent spirit and the evil
spirit; and for this *reason* they should every time utter
Ta*d*-thwâ-peresâ again <span id="fr_1815"></span>[1](#fn_1803.md), because
they should utter the original judgment again, and the twentieth time
the evil spirit becomes confounded.

29\. The eleven stanzas of A*d*-fravakhshyâ (Yas. XLIV) are made up from
the six chieftainships <span id="fr_1816"></span>[2](#fn_1804.md) and the
five accomplishments (farhâng) owing to religion; one is thus, not to do
unto others <span id="fr_1817"></span>[3](#fn_1805.md) all that which is
not well for one's self; the second is to understand fully *what* is
well-done and not-well-done; the third is to turn from the vile and
their conversation (andarag-gûftanŏ); the fourth is to confess *one's*
failings to the high-priests, and let them bring the whip; the fifth is
not to neglect the season-festivals at *their proper* hour (dên hâsar),
*nor* the other things which go to the bridge <span
id="fr_1818"></span>[4](#fn_1806.md); and the six chieftainships are not
his property who has not these

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

five accomplishments, and he is not fit even for teaching.

30\. The nineteen stanzas of Kãm-nemôi-zãm (Yas. XLV) are for this
reason, that every one may so persevere in his own duty
(khve*s*akânîh) <span id="fr_1819"></span>[1](#fn_1807.md), that while
those are our nineteen propitiations (aû*s*ôfrî*d*) <span
id="fr_1820"></span>[2](#fn_1808.md), which it says in the Sakâ*d*ûm
*Nask* <span id="fr_1821"></span>[3](#fn_1809.md) should be my own, the
strength and power of the angels shall become more considerable, and the
destroyer more perishable.

31\. The U*s*tavaiti Gâtha is a Gâtha (gâs) of four chapters <span
id="fr_1822"></span>[4](#fn_1810), and each stanza of five lines (gâs.md),
except Hê*k*a*d*-aspâ-vakhshyâ (Yas. XLV, 15) <span
id="fr_1823"></span>[5](#fn_1811.md). 32. The two repetitions of
U*s*tâ-ahmâi (Yas. XLII, 1) <span id="fr_1824"></span>[6](#fn_1812.md) are,
one *as* a retention *and* embrace of Aûharmazd, and one *as* a
destruction of the fiends; *and* U*s*ta-Ahurem-mazdãm (Visp. XXI,
1-5) <span id="fr_1825"></span>[7](#fn_1813.md) *in* like manner.

33\. Spe*n*ta-mainyû (Yas. XLVI) *has* six stanzas, Yêzî-adâi*s* (Yas.
XLVII) twelve stanzas, A*d*-mâ-yavâ (Yas. XLVIII) twelve stanzas, *and*
Ka*d*-môi-urvâ (Yas. XLIX) eleven stanzas. 34. The Spe*n*tâ-mainyû Gâtha
is a Gâtha of four chapters <span id="fr_1826"></span>[8](#fn_1814.md), and

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

each stanza of four lines; it is made up from the five chieftainships
and four classes <span id="fr_1827"></span>[1](#fn_1815.md). 35. The two
repetitions of Spe*n*tâ-mainyû (Yas. XLVI, 1) <span
id="fr_1828"></span>[2](#fn_1816.md) are, one *for* the laudation of the
beneficent spirit (spendamat), and one for that of the earth <span
id="fr_1829"></span>[3](#fn_1817.md).

36\. One Spe*n*tem-Ahurem-mazdãm (Visp. XXII, 1-11) <span
id="fr_1830"></span>[4](#fn_1818.md) is the laudation of the creatures of
the beneficent spirit, and one is the destruction of the creatures of
the evil spirit.

37\. The twenty-two stanzas of the Vohû-khshathra Gâtha (Yas. L) are
those twenty-two judgments which are lodging within judges, as written
above <span id="fr_1831"></span>[5](#fn_1819.md). 38. The two repetitions
of Vohû-khshathrem (Yas. L, 1) <span id="fr_1832"></span>[6](#fn_1820.md)
are, one the laudation of living (zîndakîh), and one of the supreme
Zaratû*s*t.

39\. One Vohû-khshathrem yazamaidê (Visp. XXIII, 1-9) <span
id="fr_1833"></span>[7](#fn_1821.md) is for the laudation of
Shatvaîrô <span id="fr_1834"></span>[8](#fn_1822.md), and one of metal. 40.
The two repetitions of

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Avi-apâm (Visp.
XXIV, 1-12) <span id="fr_1835"></span>[1](#fn_1823.md) are, one for the
laudation of waters, and one of plants.

41\. The nine stanzas of the Vahi*s*tôi*s*ti (Yas. LII) are on account
of those nine things which are <span id="fr_1836"></span>[2](#fn_1824.md) .
. . the supreme Zaratû*s*tship lodging in the supreme Zaratû*s*ts, the
source of fountains, the bridge *over* waters, and even the navigable
river, the righteous man, and the righteous woman. 42. And *it is* a
Gâtha of one chapter, *and* each stanza of four lines, except
Ithâ-î-haithyâ-narô (Yas. LII, 6) <span
id="fr_1837"></span>[3](#fn_1825.md), for *there* is always one lord and
sovereign in the world. 43. And those four lines are for this *reason*,
because *it* is declared: *k*athru*s* hamay*a*u khshapô dahmayâ*d* parô
âfritôi*d* <span id="fr_1838"></span>[4](#fn_1826.md), 'four times every
night is the "blessing of the holy" (Yas. LIX),' and three *times*
Srôsh <span id="fr_1839"></span>[5](#fn_1827.md), twice Bûshâsp <span
id="fr_1840"></span>[6](#fn_1828.md), and once Aêshm <span
id="fr_1841"></span>[7](#fn_1829.md) will come

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

to the material world. 44. And the five *lines* of that one *stanza*
(Yas. LII, 6) are for this *reason*, because the assistants of the
supreme Zaratû*s*t are five, the house-ruler, the village-ruler, the
tribe-ruler, the province-ruler, and she even who is his own wife
(nârîk) <span id="fr_1842"></span>[1](#fn_1830.md). 45. The two repetitions
of Vahi*s*tâ-î*s*tis (Yas. LII, 1) <span
id="fr_1843"></span>[2](#fn_1831.md) are, one *for* the laudation of
sovereigns, and one for the laudation of peace (pa*d*mân).

46\. The two repetitions of Vahi*s*tem-Ahurem-mazdãm (Visp. XXVI) <span
id="fr_1844"></span>[3](#fn_1832.md) are, one *for* the laudation of
Aûharmazd and the archangels, and one for the destruction of the fiends.
47. The four repetitions of the Airyamana (Yas. LIII) <span
id="fr_1845"></span>[4](#fn_1833.md) are for the existence of more
submission (aîrmânîh) in the house, village, tribe, and province. 48.
The four repetitions of Ava*d*-mi*z*dem (Visp. XXVII) are for the
healing of those <span id="fr_1846"></span>[5](#fn_1834.md) *who* dwell in
the house, village, tribe, and province.

49\. The section (kar*d*akŏ) whose beginning is Ta*d*-sôidhi*s* (Yas.
LVII, 1-9) <span id="fr_1847"></span>[6](#fn_1835.md) is, for the
completion

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

of the Gâthas, taught as *pertaining*, to the Gâthas (gâsânîk *k*â*s*t).

50\. The beginning of the Gâthas is Ahyâ-yâsâ (Yas. XXVIII, 1), and
their end is drigavê vahyô (Yas. LII, 9, end); and *there* are 278
stanzas, 1016 lines, 5567 words (vâ*k*ak), 9999 mârîk, and 16,554
khûr*d*ak <span id="fr_1848"></span>[1](#fn_1836.md). 51. For the lines and
stanzas of the Gâthas *were* collected by us, and were:—one hundred
stanzas of the Ahunavaiti Gâtha (Yas. XXVIII-XXXIV), of which each
stanza is three lines; forty stanzas of the Yasna *of seven chapters*
(Yas. XXXV-XLI, 17),

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

of which each stanza is three lines; sixty-six stanzas of the
U*s*tavaiti Gâtha (Yas. XLII-XLV), of which each stanza is five lines,
except Haê*k*a*d*-aspâ (Yas. XLV, 15), for that one is four lines;
forty-one stanzas of the Spe*n*tâ-mainyû Gâtha (Yas. XLVI-XLIX), of
which each stanza is four lines; twenty-two stanzas of the
Vohû-khshathra (Yas. L), of which each stanza is three <span
id="fr_1849"></span>[1](#fn_1837.md) lines; *and* nine stanzas of the
Vahi*s*tôi*s*ti (Yas. LII), of which each stanza is four lines, except
Ithâ-î (Yas. LII, 6), for that one is a stanza of five;—the amount of
the foregoing <span id="fr_1850"></span>[2](#fn_1838.md) is 278
stanzas <span id="fr_1851"></span>[3](#fn_1839.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1748"></span>[352:9](sbe0573.htm#fr_1760.md) That is, the
mystical meaning or influence supposed to attach to various parts of the
ancient hymns, or to the manner in which they are chanted. The term
Gâtha or 'hymn' (Pahl. gâs) is applied, in this chapter, not only to the
five Gâthas properly so called, but also to the Yasna of seven chapters,
and apparently to <span id="page_353">p. 353</span> other portions of
the Yasna written in the Gâtha dialect of the Avesta.

<span id="fn_1749"></span>[353:1](sbe0573.htm#fr_1761.md) This appears to
be the meaning, but the construction of this section is altogether very
obscure, and the text is more or less corrupt in all MSS. In the
celebration of the Yasna or Ya*z*i*s*n the officiating priest tastes the
Hôm juice during the recitation of Yas. XI (see Haug's Essays, p. 404),
and shortly afterwards he commences the preliminary prayers mentioned in
the text.

<span id="fn_1750"></span>[353:2](sbe0573.htm#fr_1762.md) Both K20 and M6
have Frerân in Pâzand.

<span id="fn_1751"></span>[353:3](sbe0573.htm#fr_1763.md) Both K20 and M6
omit the initial f.

<span id="fn_1752"></span>[353:4](sbe0573.htm#fr_1764.md) M6 has âstuyê.

<span id="fn_1753"></span>[353:5](sbe0573.htm#fr_1765.md) M6 omits this
word.

<span id="fn_1754"></span>[353:6](sbe0573.htm#fr_1766.md) This is the
Avesta name of the Hâ or chapter consisting of Yas. XIII, 27-XIV, 19; as
Fraoreti is the name of the preceding Hâ, consisting of Yas. XII,
I-XIII, 26.

<span id="fn_1755"></span>[353:7](sbe0573.htm#fr_1767.md) Probably
consisting of the three Hâs, Yas. XV-XVII; in which case, the meaning
seems to be that the three Ashem-vohûs, at the beginning of this
preliminary ritual, are symbolical of each of the three triplets of
chapters which follow them; first, of the Fravarânê, Fraoreti, and
Âstaothwanem chapters; secondly, of the three chapters of the
Stôtân-yasnô; and thirdly, of those of the Baghân Ya*s*t.

<span id="fn_1756"></span>[354:1](sbe0573.htm#fr_1768.md) See Chap. I, 3.

<span id="fn_1757"></span>[354:2](sbe0573.htm#fr_1769.md) Referring to one
about to become a priest.

<span id="fn_1758"></span>[354:3](sbe0573.htm#fr_1770.md) The Av. a*s*tra
and sraoshô-*k*arana of Vend. IV, 38-114, &c., which were formerly used
for the temporal punishment of sinners. Whether they are here brought to
the neophyte as a token of his admission to the priesthood, or are
administered to him as a punishment for his offences, is not quite
clear.

<span id="fn_1759"></span>[354:4](sbe0573.htm#fr_1771.md) The five Gâthas
are the Ahunavaiti (Yas. XXVIII-XXXIV), the U*s*tavaiti (Yas. XLII-XLV),
the Spe*n*tâ-mainyû (Yas. XLVI-XLIX), the Vohû-khshathra (Yas. L), and
the Vahi*s*tôi*s*ti (Yas. LII); these collections of hymns are thus
named from the words with which each of them commences, excepting the
first, which derives its name from the Ahunavar (see Bund. I, 21) which
is written in the same metre.

<span id="fn_1760"></span>[354:5](sbe0573.htm#fr_1772.md) This is the
Pahlavi form of the Parsi navazûdi, a term applied to the whole
initiatory ceremonial of a nônâbar, or newly initiated priest; the term
evidently implies that the ceremony is considered somewhat in the light
of 'regeneration.'

<span id="fn_1761"></span>[354:6](sbe0573.htm#fr_1773.md) That is, he can
take his part in the regular priestly duties, including the initiation
of other neophytes.

<span id="fn_1762"></span>[354:7](sbe0573.htm#fr_1774.md) Both K20 and M6
have four in ciphers, which can hardly be right; the sentence is clear
enough, but the idea of its writer is rather obscure.

<span id="fn_1763"></span>[355:1](sbe0573.htm#fr_1775.md) These first three
chapters of the Ahunavaiti collection of hymns are here supposed to
symbolize the three material elements, whose union distinguishes a man's
body from inorganic substances; while the eleven stanzas, which each of
these chapters contains, symbolize the eleven immaterial existences said
to be contained in the same body.

<span id="fn_1764"></span>[355:2](sbe0573.htm#fr_1776.md) This is doubtful,
as no verb is expressed, and, the word bâr, 'time,' is struck out in M6,
so it is possible to read 'the "three foremost" of the
Ashem-Ahurem-mazdãm are the coming of Hûshê*d*ar,' &c. The 'three
foremost' (3 levînŏg) would be a possible Pahlavi translation of the Av.
ti*s*rô paoiryô and ti*s*ra paoirya of Visp. XV, 4-6, instead of the
actual 'three first' (3-i fratûm), as may be seen from Pahl. Visp. VIII,
17, 20, where both pê*s* (= levînŏ) and fratûm are used indifferently
for Av. paoiryô. At any rate the idea embodied in the text is that these
'three first' have some reference to the three future apostles of the
Parsi religion (see Bund. XXXII, 8, B. Yt. III, 13, 44, 52, 62). In
fact, however, they seem to refer to the first three chapters of the
Ahunavaiti Gâtha, immediately after which this chapter (Visp. XV) is
recited in the full Parsi ritual; the phrase being rendered in the
Pahlavi translation thus:—'I reverence the three first by not speaking
out, that is, I do not say anything during them, and not wearing out,
that is, I do not doze away during them.'

<span id="fn_1765"></span>[355:3](sbe0573.htm#fr_1777.md) K20 has 'arrive
early.'

<span id="fn_1766"></span>[356:1](sbe0573.htm#fr_1778.md) See B. Yt. III,
25. Both the Avesta text here quoted and the translation suggested must
be received with caution, as the MSS. do not agree in the three central
words; K20 has manaNhê de vîspâi kaua, and M6 has manaNhê kya vîsâi
kaia. The former reading has been adopted, with very slight correction,
as it seems the more intelligible; but the meaning of the preceding
word, anaomô, is, far from certain. The writer seems to have been
quoting from a Pahlavi version of the Nask which contained this Avesta
quotation.

<span id="fn_1767"></span>[356:2](sbe0573.htm#fr_1779.md) This Hâ, which
begins with the words a*hv*yâ*k*â *hv*aêtu*s*, is not called by its
initial words, as the preceding chapters are, but has this special name
(see the prayers at the end of it) derived from its second word, and
which is corrupted in Pahlavi into Khvêtmanŏ.

<span id="fn_1768"></span>[356:3](sbe0573.htm#fr_1780.md) Here written
Gavî*d*-*s*êdâ-dâ*d* as in Sls. Part I, and not Vadîkdâ*d* as in other
parts of Sls. Part II (see § 19 and Chap. XII, 4, 6, 20, 23, 26). Vend.
I contains an account of the sixteen <span id="page_357">p. 357</span>
'best of regions and countries' where the Iranian power and religion
extended at an early date.

<span id="fn_1769"></span>[357:1](sbe0573.htm#fr_1781.md) The seven
archangels besides their spiritual duties have severally charge of the
seven worldly existences, man, animals, fire, metal, earth, water, and
plants (see § 14 and Chap. XV). But perhaps we should read 'angels,' as
they are often mentioned as 'the angels of the spiritual and worldly
existences.'

<span id="fn_1770"></span>[357:2](sbe0573.htm#fr_1782.md) This quotation,
of which the Pahlavi translation is first given, and then the Avesta
text, is from Vend. XIX, 107.

<span id="fn_1771"></span>[357:3](sbe0573.htm#fr_1783.md) This stanza is
recited thrice, and about the same time the officiating priest strains
the Hôm juice, and prepares to pour holy-water into the mortar in which
the Hôm twigs were pounded (see Haug's Essays, pp. 402, 406).

<span id="fn_1772"></span>[357:4](sbe0573.htm#fr_1784.md) Or 'professions'
of the community, of which there were originally only three, the priest,
warrior, and husbandman; but at a later date the artizan was added. Both
K20 and M6 have 'four classes,' but this is inconsistent with the 'three
repetitions.' The Avesta generally knows only three classes, but four
are mentioned in the Baghân Ya*s*t (Yas. XIX, 46).

<span id="fn_1773"></span>[357:5](sbe0573.htm#fr_1785.md) That is,
probably, at the words Ahurô mazd*a*us*k*â in the first line, and
ashem*k*â frâda*d* in the second line of the stanza; but this is
doubtful, as the MSS. give the words corruptly, in a mixture of Av. and
Pahl., as follows: pavan Ahurâi mazdâi ahârayih-i da*d*ŏîh.

<span id="fn_1774"></span>[358:1](sbe0573.htm#fr_1786.md) The first word in
the third line of the stanza; but this, again, has to be guessed from a
Pahlavi version in the MSS. which may be read va vâ-srôdâân.

<span id="fn_1775"></span>[358:2](sbe0573.htm#fr_1787.md) Or 'produced.'

<span id="fn_1776"></span>[358:3](sbe0573.htm#fr_1788.md) In the last
division of that Nask (see B. Yt. III, 25, note).

<span id="fn_1777"></span>[358:4](sbe0573.htm#fr_1789.md) This last stanza
of the Ahunavaiti Gâtha is recited four times.

<span id="fn_1778"></span>[358:5](sbe0573.htm#fr_1790.md) See Yas. XIX,
50-52. The last of these rulers must have been the supreme pontiff or
patriarch of the province, and in the province of Ragha (Rages or Raî,
near Teheran) he was both temporal and spiritual ruler.

<span id="fn_1779"></span>[358:6](sbe0573.htm#fr_1791.md) This first stanza
of the Ahunavaiti Gâtha is recited twice, not only in its proper place
(as the first stanza of each chapter is, in the Gâthas), but also at the
end of every chapter of the Ahunavaiti Gâtha, while the officiating
priest sprinkles the sacred twigs with the sacred milk or gâu*s*
*g*îvya, 'living-cow produce' (see Haug's Essays, pp. 405, 406).

<span id="fn_1780"></span>[359:1](sbe0573.htm#fr_1792.md) After the two
Ahyâ-yâsâs, at the end of each chapter of the Ahunavaiti Gâtha, the
Yathâ-ahû-vairyô formula (see Bund. I, 21) is recited four times.

<span id="fn_1781"></span>[359:2](sbe0573.htm#fr_1793.md) Or 'to sum up.'

<span id="fn_1782"></span>[359:3](sbe0573.htm#fr_1794.md) It is not quite
clear how pavan, 'in, on, with, by, through, as, for,' &c., should be
translated in each clause of this section; but the intention is
evidently to compare the seven chapters of the Ahunavaiti Gathâ with the
seven archangels and the seven earthly creations which they severally
protect (see Chap. XV).

<span id="fn_1783"></span>[359:4](sbe0573.htm#fr_1795.md) Here written
Shatrîvar.

<span id="fn_1784"></span>[359:5](sbe0573.htm#fr_1796.md) Meaning probably
'the prosperity which is *occasioned* by;' but the exact signification
of the word frâk-shâm or freh-kashâm (or however it may be read) is
uncertain.

<span id="fn_1785"></span>[359:6](sbe0573.htm#fr_1797.md) Spendômat or
Spendamat in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_1786"></span>[360:1](sbe0573.htm#fr_1798.md) That is, the
Yasna of seven chapters (Yas. XXXV-XLI), which is called simply 'the
Yasna' in this chapter. This last clause, which is omitted in M6,
connects these later hymns with the four classes of the community (see §
9), just as the five older hymns are connected with the five chiefs of
the community (see § 11) in the former clauses. This section may be a
translation from the Avesta, as the verbs precede their nominatives.

<span id="fn_1787"></span>[360:2](sbe0573.htm#fr_1799.md) That is, the
beginning of the Yasna of seven chapters.

<span id="fn_1788"></span>[360:3](sbe0573.htm#fr_1800.md) See Chap. X, 21;
but the Sakâ*d*ûm Nask (see Chap. X, 25) is probably meant, as it
contained a section on ordeals by heat and cold.

<span id="fn_1789"></span>[360:4](sbe0573.htm#fr_1801.md) These Avesta
words are evidently corrupt, but perhaps 'a quadruple fire' is meant.
K20 has *k*athrâyâim âthraiãm.

<span id="fn_1790"></span>[360:5](sbe0573.htm#fr_1802.md) Here written
Vandîkdâ*d* (see § 7). The passage here cited is not a quotation, but
only a brief summary of Vend. III, 1-37; and appears to have been
derived direct from the Avesta, without the assistance of the Pahlavi
version, as several words differ from that translation.

<span id="fn_1791"></span>[361:1](sbe0573.htm#fr_1803.md) The verb is
probably omitted by mistake, and we ought to read 'voids urine upon it,'
in accordance with Vend. III, 20.

<span id="fn_1792"></span>[361:2](sbe0573.htm#fr_1804.md) See Bund. XII, 8.

<span id="fn_1793"></span>[361:3](sbe0573.htm#fr_1805.md) Reading kalêndend
(Pers. kalandand), as Vend. III, 27 refers to burial of the dead, and
the same idea might be obtained, more fancifully, by reading kilînênd,
'they turn to clay' (compare Pers. gil, 'clay'); but the most obvious
reading is karînênd, 'they cut,' and as the sentence stands it would
imply that 'they cut up its dead.'

<span id="fn_1794"></span>[361:4](sbe0573.htm#fr_1806.md) See Chap. II, 6.

<span id="fn_1795"></span>[361:5](sbe0573.htm#fr_1807.md) The three
apostles expected in the future (see § 5 and Bund. XXXII, 8). It is
doubtful whether these three passages in the <span id="page_362">p.
362</span> Yasna are here intended all to refer to the same subject, but
no other subject is mentioned for the two former. Having completed the
enumeration of the sections of the Yasna of seven chapters, the writer
is now proceeding to notice those passages which are recited more than
once in the performance of the ritual.

<span id="fn_1796"></span>[362:1](sbe0573.htm#fr_1808.md) M6 has gairî, 'in
a song,' with the obsolete g, which is very like s, and is also used in
the word garô in § 22; this is a variant well worth consideration by
translators of the Avesta. K20 has only Ashahyâ.

<span id="fn_1797"></span>[362:2](sbe0573.htm#fr_1809.md) This formula (see
B. Yt. II, 64) is recited after every chapter of the Gâthas, but does
not appear to be anywhere recited twice; so the words 2 dânar, 'two
repetitions,' may perhaps be inserted here in the wrong place, as they
are wanting in § 25.

<span id="fn_1798"></span>[362:3](sbe0573.htm#fr_1810.md) These words are
omitted in the Pahlavi text, evidently through mistake.

<span id="fn_1799"></span>[362:4](sbe0573.htm#fr_1811.md) Visp. XIX, XX
follow Yas. XLI in the full Parsi ritual, and the first of them is
recited twice.

<span id="fn_1800"></span>[362:5](sbe0573.htm#fr_1812.md) The Frôbâk is the
oldest sacred fire on earth, and the Vâzi*s*t is the lightning. (see
Bund. XVII, 1, 5, SZS. XI, 5, 8-10).

<span id="fn_1801"></span>[362:6](sbe0573.htm#fr_1813.md) The first chapter
of the U*s*tavaiti Gâtha (see § 2, note 4), so called from its first
word u*s*tâ.

<span id="fn_1802"></span>[362:7](sbe0573.htm#fr_1814.md) See § 7.

<span id="fn_1803"></span>[363:1](sbe0573.htm#fr_1815.md) That is, the
first line (ta*d* thwâ peresâ ere*s* môi vao*k*â Ahurâ! 'that I shall
ask thee, tell *it* me right, O Ahura!') is repeated at the beginning of
each of the first nineteen stanzas, and the first stanza being recited
twice (as in all chapters of the Gâthas) these words are recited twenty
times before the last stanza is reached. The phrases 'and for this
*reason*' and 'because they should utter the original judgment again'
are omitted in M6.

<span id="fn_1804"></span>[363:2](sbe0573.htm#fr_1816.md) These cannot be
the same 'chieftainships' (ra*d*îh) as those mentioned in § 11, of which
there are only five; but perhaps they are the spiritual chieftainships,
or primacies, of the six other regions of the earth (see Bund. XXIX, 1).

<span id="fn_1805"></span>[363:3](sbe0573.htm#fr_1817.md) Assuming that
aî*s*an stands for aî*s*ân.

<span id="fn_1806"></span>[363:4](sbe0573.htm#fr_1818.md) The *K*inva*d*
bridge, or route of the soul to the other world (see Chap. XII, 31).
Part of these fourth and fifth clauses is omitted in K20 by mistake.

<span id="fn_1807"></span>[364:1](sbe0573.htm#fr_1819.md) Or, it may be,
'through his own intellect (khvê*s*ak hûsh),' or merely another mode of
writing khvê*s*kârîh, 'industry.'

<span id="fn_1808"></span>[364:2](sbe0573.htm#fr_1820.md) Considering each
of the stanzas as an offering to, or propitiation of, (Av. usefriti) the
angels.

<span id="fn_1809"></span>[364:3](sbe0573.htm#fr_1821.md) See Chap. X, 25.

<span id="fn_1810"></span>[364:4](sbe0573.htm#fr_1822.md) Those detailed in
§§ 27-30.

<span id="fn_1811"></span>[364:5](sbe0573.htm#fr_1823.md) Which stanza has
only four lines. Pahl. gâs means both the whole hymn and also each line
of the hymn.

<span id="fn_1812"></span>[364:6](sbe0573.htm#fr_1824.md) The first stanza
of the U*s*tavaiti Gâtha, which is recited twice, both in its proper
place and at the end of each chapter of that Gâtha (see § 12, note).

<span id="fn_1813"></span>[364:7](sbe0573.htm#fr_1825.md) Visp. XXI follows
Yas. XLV in the full Parsi ritual, and is recited twice.

<span id="fn_1814"></span>[364:8](sbe0573.htm#fr_1826.md) Those detailed in
§ 33.

<span id="fn_1815"></span>[365:1](sbe0573.htm#fr_1827.md) See §§ 9, 11.

<span id="fn_1816"></span>[365:2](sbe0573.htm#fr_1828.md) The first stanza
of the Spe*n*tâ-mainyû Gâtha, which is recited twice, both in its proper
place and at the end of each chapter of that Gâtha (see § 12, note).

<span id="fn_1817"></span>[365:3](sbe0573.htm#fr_1829.md) It seems probable
that the Pahlavi writer has here confounded Spendamat, 'the beneficent
spirit,' with the archangel Spendarma*d* who has special charge of the
earth; their names being even more alike in Pahlavi than in English,
though corrupted from the distinct Avesta forms spe*n*ta mainyu and
spe*n*ta ârmaiti, respectively.

<span id="fn_1818"></span>[365:4](sbe0573.htm#fr_1830.md) Visp. XXII
follows Yas. XLIX in the full Parsi ritual, and is recited twice.

<span id="fn_1819"></span>[365:5](sbe0573.htm#fr_1831.md) See § 6.

<span id="fn_1820"></span>[365:6](sbe0573.htm#fr_1832.md) The first stanza
of the Vohû-khshathra Gâtha, which is recited twice, both at the
beginning and end of the chapter (see § 12, note).

<span id="fn_1821"></span>[365:7](sbe0573.htm#fr_1833.md) Visp. XXIII, 1-9
follows Yas. L in the full Parsi ritual, and is recited twice.

<span id="fn_1822"></span>[365:8](sbe0573.htm#fr_1834.md) The archangel who
has special charge of metal (see § 14, Chap. XV, 5, 14-19, and Bund. I,
26, XXX, 19); the name is here written Shatrîvar.

<span id="fn_1823"></span>[366:1](sbe0573.htm#fr_1835.md) After the two
recitations of Visp. XXIII, 1-9 there follow Vend. XV, XVI, and Visp.
XXIII, 10, and then Visp. XXIV, 1-12 is recited twice, in the full Parsi
ritual, followed by Visp. XXV.

<span id="fn_1824"></span>[366:2](sbe0573.htm#fr_1836.md) Some words are
evidently lost here; M6 has m followed by a blank space, and K20 has
madam, 'on.' It is not quite certain whether the things mentioned are to
be reckoned as four, five, or six; but assuming they are five, it is
possible that the four things missing in the text are the four remaining
chieftainships (see § 11), the rulerships of the house, village, tribe,
and province lodged in the rulers of the same respectively.

<span id="fn_1825"></span>[366:3](sbe0573.htm#fr_1837.md) Which stanza has
five lines, and is, therefore, here considered symbolical of the ruling
monarch, or pontiff.

<span id="fn_1826"></span>[366:4](sbe0573.htm#fr_1838.md) This Avesta
passage does not appear to be extant elsewhere, and its Pahlavi
translation, given in the text, is not quite correct it would be better
thus: 'through the "blessing of the holy" four times every night;' dahma
âfriti (Pahl. dâhmân âfrînô, 'blessing of the holy') is the technical
name of Yas. LIX.

<span id="fn_1827"></span>[366:5](sbe0573.htm#fr_1839.md) See Bund. XIX,
33, XXX, 29. This angel, invoked by the 'blessing' (Yas. LIX, 8), comes
to defend mankind against the wiles of Bûshâsp and Aêshm.

<span id="fn_1828"></span>[366:6](sbe0573.htm#fr_1840.md) The demoness of
sloth (see Bund. XXVIII, 26).

<span id="fn_1829"></span>[366:7](sbe0573.htm#fr_1841.md) The demon of
wrath (see Bund. XXVIII, 15-17, 20).

<span id="fn_1830"></span>[367:1](sbe0573.htm#fr_1842.md) Though bound to
be strictly obedient to her husband or guardian, a Mazdayasnian woman
occupied a more honourable position in the community than was sanctioned
by any other oriental religion.

<span id="fn_1831"></span>[367:2](sbe0573.htm#fr_1843.md) The first stanza
of the Vahi*s*tôi*s*ti Gâtha, which is recited twice, both at the
beginning and end of the chapter (see § 12, note).

<span id="fn_1832"></span>[367:3](sbe0573.htm#fr_1844.md) Visp. XXVI
follows Yas. LII in the full Parsi ritual, and is recited twice,
followed by Vend. XIX, XX.

<span id="fn_1833"></span>[367:4](sbe0573.htm#fr_1845.md) So called from
its first words â airy*e*mâ; it is recited four times after Vend. XX,
and shortly afterwards Visp. XXVII is also recited four times, as
mentioned in § 48.

<span id="fn_1834"></span>[367:5](sbe0573.htm#fr_1846.md) M6 has 'of the
soul,' which is, no doubt, a blunder due to the illegibility of the MS.
from which it was copied.

<span id="fn_1835"></span>[367:6](sbe0573.htm#fr_1847.md) This is the
Fshûshô-mãthra ('a spell or prayer for prosperity.') Of Visp. I, 28, II,
30, Yas. LVI, ix, 6, LVIII, 13. Whether the remainder of Yas. LVII is to
be considered as pertaining to the Gâthas is uncertain; it is recited in
seven sections by the assistant priest, each section from a different
position; these seven positions being the stations of the seven
assistant priests who are supposed to be present spiritually, and to be
arranged three on each side, and one at the south end, of the ceremonial
area, while the chief officiating priest occupies the north end (see
Haug's Essays, p. 332).

<span id="fn_1836"></span>[368:1](sbe0573.htm#fr_1848.md) The numbers of
the stanzas and lines are correct, as may be seen from the details given
in § 51. Regarding the words there is the uncertainty as to what
constitutes a compound word, but, taking each compound in Westergaard's
edition of the texts as a single word, the total number of words in the
1016 lines is about 6147; and this could be reduced to 5567 only by
omitting the Yasna of seven chapters, and somewhat relaxing the rule as
to compound words. The meaning of the last two terms, mârik and
khûr*d*ak, is doubtful, but they are certainly not syllables and
letters, as the number of syllables exceeds 13,000. In other places (see
Bund. I, 21) mârik usually means 'a word,' but that meaning is expressed
by the term vâ*k*ak here. If the number 9999 be correct, mârîk must
signify some particular class of syllable which would include about
three-fourths of the whole number of syllables. It may be noted,
however, that Zâ*d*-sparam, in the particulars he gives about the Gâthas
(see SZS. XI, 10, note 6), states the number of mârîk at 6666. The
khûr*d*ak or 'small' things are probably the consonants.

<span id="fn_1837"></span>[369:1](sbe0573.htm#fr_1849.md) All MSS. have
'four,' and then add the exception about Ithâ-i to the account of this
Gâtha, instead of mentioning it in the details of the Vahi*s*tôi*s*ti;
which blunder is here corrected.

<span id="fn_1838"></span>[369:2](sbe0573.htm#fr_1850.md) Reading kadmon
yehevûni*s*nŏ, but the latter word, with part of the ciphers which
follow, is torn away in K20, and in M6 it is written so as to resemble
the Avesta letters gnn gnn, which are unintelligible, though something
like Pahl. yehevûni*s*nŏ; there can, however, be little doubt as to the
general meaning of the phrase.

<span id="fn_1839"></span>[369:3](sbe0573.htm#fr_1851.md) The number of
lines is easily computed from the same details, as follows:—300 + 120 +
329 + 164 + 66 + 37 = 1016 lines, as stated in § 50, and as they still
exist in the Gâtha texts.
