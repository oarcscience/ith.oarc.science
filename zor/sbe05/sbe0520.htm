<p>1. On the nature of the earth it says in revelation, that <I>there</I> are thirty and three kinds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_153"></A><A HREF="#fn_153"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of land. 2. <I>On</I> the day when T&icirc;<I>s</I>tar produced the rain, when its seas arose therefrom, the whole place, half taken up by water, was converted into seven portions; this portion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_154"></A><A HREF="#fn_154"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, as much as one-half, is the middle, <I>and</I> six portions are around; those six portions are <I>together</I> as much as Khvan&icirc;ras. 3. The name</p>

<p>k&ecirc;shvar ('zone or region') is also applied to them, and <I>they</I> existed side by side (kash&nbsp;kash)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_155"></A><A HREF="#fn_155"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; as on the east side of this portion (Khvan&icirc;ras) is the Savah region, <I>on</I> the west is the Arzah region; the two portions on the south side are the Frada<I>d</I>afsh <I>and</I> V&icirc;da<I>d</I>afsh regions, the two portions on the north side are the V&ocirc;r&ucirc;bar<I>s</I>t <I>and</I> V&ocirc;r&ucirc;<I>g</I>ar<I>s</I>t regions, <I>and</I> that in the middle is Khvan&icirc;ras. 4. And Khvan&icirc;ras has the sea, for one part of the wide-formed ocean wound about around it; <I>and from</I> V&ocirc;r&ucirc;bar<I>s</I>t <I>and</I> V&ocirc;r&ucirc;<I>g</I>ar<I>s</I>t a lofty mountain grew up; so that it is not possible for any one to go from region to region&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_156"></A><A HREF="#fn_156"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>5. And of these seven regions every benefit was created most in Khvan&icirc;ras, and the evil spirit also produced most for Khvan&icirc;ras, on account of the superiority (sar&icirc;h)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_157"></A><A HREF="#fn_157"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> which he saw in it. 6. For the Kay&acirc;nians and heroes were created in Khvan&icirc;ras; and the good religion of the Mazdayasnians was created in Khvan&icirc;ras, and afterwards conveyed to the other regions; S&ocirc;shyans&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_158"></A><A HREF="#fn_158"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> is born in Khvan&icirc;ras, who makes the evil spirit impotent, and causes the resurrection <I>and</I> future existence.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_153"></A><A HREF="sbe0520.htm#fr_153">32:3</A> K20b has 'thirty-two kinds.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_154"></A><A HREF="sbe0520.htm#fr_154">32:4</A> That is, Khvan&icirc;ras; or it may be 'one portion,' as han&acirc;, 'this,' is often used for a&ecirc;, 'one,' because the P&acirc;zand form of both words is <I>e</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_155"></A><A HREF="sbe0520.htm#fr_155">33:1</A> Possibly an attempt to connect the term k&ecirc;shvar with kash; but the sentence may also be translated thus: 'and <I>they</I> formed various districts like this portion; on the east side is the Savah region,' &amp;c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_156"></A><A HREF="sbe0520.htm#fr_156">33:2</A> In the Pahlavi Vend. I, 4a, and in the Mainy&ocirc;-i-khar<I>d</I>, IX, 6, it is added, 'except with the permission of the angels' or the demons.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_157"></A><A HREF="sbe0520.htm#fr_157">33:3</A> So in M6; but K20 has za<I>d</I>&acirc;r&icirc;h, which would imply, 'for the destruction of what he saw of it.'</P>

K20 and M6, and corrupted into S&ocirc;shy&ocirc;s in P&acirc;zand; but it is more usually written S&ocirc;sh&acirc;ns in other Pahlavi works, and its Avesta form is Saoshy&atilde;s (see Chap. XXXII, 8).</P>
