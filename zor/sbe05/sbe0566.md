### CHAPTER VI.

1\. The deaf and dumb and helpless (armê*s*t) <span
id="fr_1485"></span>[2](#fn_1475.md), though of unblemished conduct and
proper disposition, is incapable of doing good works, and from the
*time* when he is born till the *time* when he shall die, all the duty
and good works which they may perform in the world become his property
(naf*s*man) as much as his even by whom *they* are performed; some say
that it is thus: as much as they belong to Zaratû*s*t <span
id="fr_1486"></span>[3](#fn_1476.md). 2. Though he does not do the good
works not really originating with (ahambûni*k*) him, and does not commit
the sin not really originating with *him, it* is better than though *he
were* able to do the good works not really originating with him, *and*
should not do *them*; but should commit the sin not really originating
with *him;* when, afterwards, he passes away, and then also comes to
*his* account as to sin and good works, when the good works not really
originating with him are more *he is* in heaven (vahi*s*t), when the sin

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

not really originating with *him* is more *he is* in hell <span
id="fr_1487"></span>[1](#fn_1477.md), and when both are equal *he is* among
the ever-stationary (hamîstakân) <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[1](#fn_1477.md). 3. When the good works are three
Srôshô-*k*aranâms <span id="fr_1489"></span>[2](#fn_1478.md) more than the
sins *he is* in heaven (vahi*s*t), when the good works are one Tanâpûhar
more he attains to the best existence (pâhlûm ahvân) <span
id="fr_1490"></span>[3](#fn_1479), when his ceremony (ya*s*t.md) is

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

performed <span id="fr_1491"></span>[1](#fn_1480.md). 4. Sôshyans <span
id="fr_1492"></span>[2](#fn_1481.md) said that to come into that best
existence it is not necessary to perform the ceremony, for when his good
works are one <span id="fr_1493"></span>[3](#fn_1482.md) Tanâpûhar more
than the sin he attains to the best existence, and no account is *taken*
of performing his ceremony; because in the heavenly existence
(garô*d*mânîkîh) it is not necessary to perform a ceremony, for an
excess of good works must attain Garô*d*mân <span
id="fr_1494"></span>[4](#fn_1483.md). 5. As Sôshyans said, in heaven
(vahi*s*t) he who is below is elevated to him who is above; *and* it
says thus: 'Happy indeed art thou, O man! who art in any way near unto
that imperishable existence <span id="fr_1495"></span>[5](#fn_1484.md).'

6\. Kûshtanŏ-bû*g*ê*d* <span id="fr_1496"></span>[6](#fn_1485.md) said that
an infidel (akdînô) <span id="fr_1497"></span>[7](#fn_1486.md), when *his*
good works are one Tanâpûhar more than *his* sin, is saved from hell.

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

7\. of a pure law (dâ*d*) are we of the good religion, and we are of the
primitive faith; of a mixed law are *those of* the Sînîk
congregation <span id="fr_1498"></span>[1](#fn_1487.md); of a vile

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

law are the Zandîk <span id="fr_1499"></span>[1](#fn_1488.md), the
Christian (Tarsâk), the Jew (Yahû*d*), and others of this sort
(*s*anŏ) <span id="fr_1500"></span>[2](#fn_1489.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1475"></span>[293:2](sbe0566.htm#fr_1485.md) That is, any one
compelled to remain stationary or secluded, owing to bodily or mental
infirmity (see Chap. II, 98); an idiot, or insane person, is probably
meant here.

<span id="fn_1476"></span>[293:3](sbe0566.htm#fr_1486.md) This comment
seems to imply that its writer was translating from an Avesta text, and
here met with a word which some persons thought contained a reference to
Zaratû*s*t, but which he first translated so as to suit the context;
perhaps Av. zarazdâiti may be suggested.

<span id="fn_1477"></span>[294:1](sbe0566.htm#fr_1488.md) That is, he is
treated, with regard to the actions merely imputed to him, precisely as
all others are with regard to their own actions. With reference to the
hamîstakân, Ar*d*â-Vîrâf states (AV. VI, 2, 5-12) that on his journey to
the other world he 'saw the souls of several people who remain in the
same position,' and he was informed that 'they call this the place of
the Hamîstakân ("those ever-stationary"), and these souls remain *in*
this place till the future existence; and *they are* the souls of those
people whose good works and sin were equal. Speak out to the worldlings
thus: "Consider not the easier good works with avarice and vexation! for
every one whose good works are three Srôshô-*k*aranâms more than *his*
sin is for heaven, *they* whose sin is more are for hell, they *in* whom
both are equal remain among these Hamîstakân till the future existence."
And their punishment is cold or heat from the changing of the
atmosphere; and they have no other adversity.'

<span id="fn_1478"></span>[294:2](sbe0566.htm#fr_1489.md) Probably
equivalent to a Farmân sin (see Chaps, I, 1, 2, IV, 14, note).

<span id="fn_1479"></span>[294:3](sbe0566.htm#fr_1490.md) This appears to
be another name for Garô*d*mân, 'the abode of song,' which is the
highest heaven, or dwelling of Aûharmazd. The lower heaven is here
called Vahi*s*t, which is a general term for heaven in general. AV.
VII-XXVII, 27, and Mkh. VII, 9-12, 20, 21 describe four grades in heaven
and four in hell, besides the intermediate neutral position of the
Hamîstakân (AV. VI, Mkh. VII, 18, 19). The four grades of heaven,
proceeding upwards, are Hûmat for good thoughts in the station of the
stars, Hûkht for good words in the station of the moon, Hûvar*s*t for
good deeds in the station of the sun, and Garô*d*mân where Aûharmazd
dwells (Vend. XIX, 12 1). And the four grades of hell, proceeding
downwards, are Dû*s*-hûmat for evil thoughts, Dû*s*-hûkht for evil
words, Dû*s*-hûvar*s*t for evil deeds, and the darkest hell (Vend. XIX,
147) where the evil spirit dwells. The pâhlûm ahvân of <span
id="page_295">p. 295</span> the text is merely the Pahlavi form of Av.
vahi*s*tem ahûm (Vend. VII, 133, XVIII, 69, XIX, 120, Yas. IX, 64),
whence the term vahi*s*t (Pers. bahi*s*t) is also derived.

<span id="fn_1480"></span>[295:1](sbe0566.htm#fr_1491.md) That is, when his
surviving relatives have performed the proper religious ceremonies after
his death.

<span id="fn_1481"></span>[295:2](sbe0566.htm#fr_1492.md) See Chap. I, 3.

<span id="fn_1482"></span>[295:3](sbe0566.htm#fr_1493.md) Reading aê,
'one,' and supposing that this Pâz. form has been substituted for an
original Huz. khadûk, 'one.' This supposition being necessary to account
for the aê preceding its noun, instead of following it; and without it
we ought to read 'three' instead of 'one,' which seems, however, hardly
reconcilable with the context (but compare Pahl. Vend. VII, 136). This,
is an instance of the ambiguity occasioned by aê, 'one,' and the cipher
3 being often written alike in Pahlavi, as already noticed in p. 289,
note 3. The word might also be taken as the conditional verbal form aê,
'shall be,' but in that case it is likewise misplaced.

<span id="fn_1483"></span>[295:4](sbe0566.htm#fr_1494.md) See note on
pâhlûm ahvân in § 3.

<span id="fn_1484"></span>[295:5](sbe0566.htm#fr_1495.md) A somewhat
similar exclamation to that in Vend. VII, 136.

<span id="fn_1485"></span>[295:6](sbe0566.htm#fr_1496.md) See Chap. I, 4,
note.

<span id="fn_1486"></span>[295:7](sbe0566.htm#fr_1497.md) That is, one of
another religion; not an apostate, nor an atheist.

<span id="fn_1487"></span>[296:1](sbe0566.htm#fr_1498.md) It is not easy to
identify this Sînîk va*s*kar*d*îh, but Professor J. Darmesteter suggests
that the term may have been applied to the Manicheans settled in eastern
Turkistân and western China, whence they may have been called Sînîk (the
country of the Sênî, Av. Sâini, being identified with *K*înîstân or
China in Bund. XV, 29, because *TS*în is the Arabic name of the latter).
This is confirmed, to some extent, by a passage in the Dînkar*d* (see
Dastûr Pêshôtan's edition of the Pahlavi text, p. 27), where three
foreign religions are mentioned, that of the Jews from Arûm, that of the
Messiah from the west, and that of Mânih from Turkistân. Darmesteter
further points out the following passages in Barbier de Meynard's French
translation of Mas’aûdî, which show that the Manicheans had considerable
influence in eastern Turkistân as late as A.D. 944:—

(Meynard, I, 268): '. . . the Turks, the Khuzlu*g*, and the Taghazghaz,
who occupy the town of Kû*s*ân, situated between Khurâsân and China, and
who are now (A.D. 944) the most valiant, most powerful, and best
governed of all the Turkish races and tribes. Their kings bear the title
of îrkhân ("sub-khân?"), and they alone, among all these nations,
profess the religion of Mânî.'

Again, after stating that the Chinese were at first Samanians
(Buddhists), it is added (Meynard, II, 258): 'Their kingdom is
contiguous to that of the Taghazghaz, who, as we have said above, are
Manicheans, and proclaim the simultaneous existence of the two
principles of light and darkness. These people were living in
simplicity, and in a faith like that of the Turkish races, when there
turned up among them a demon of the dualist sect, who showed them, in
tempting language, two opposing principles in everything that exists in
the world, such as life and death, health and sickness, riches and
poverty, light and darkness, union and separation, connection and
severance, rising and setting, existence and non-existence, night and
day, &c. Then, he spoke to them of the various ailments which afflict
rational beings, animals, children, idiots, and madmen; and he added
that God could not be responsible for this evil, which was in
distressing contradiction to the excellence which distinguishes his
works, and that he was <span id="page_297">p. 297</span> above any such
imputation. By these quibbles, and others like them, he carried away
their minds, and made them adopt his errors.

The tenets of the Manicheans ought, no doubt, to have been considered by
the Zoroastrians as a mixture of truth and error, just as those of the
Sînîk congregation are represented to be in our text; but such tenets
being an heretical offshoot of Zoroastrianism, it argues unusual
liberality in the priests if they preferred Manicheans to Christians,
that is, heretics to infidels.

K20 has altered sînîk va*s*kar*d*îh into nisînîk (or vîdînîk)
*s*ikaftîh, which appears to be an attempt to bring the words within the
limits of the writer's knowledge, without paying much attention to their
collective meaning.

<span id="fn_1488"></span>[297:1](sbe0566.htm#fr_1499.md) A sect which
(according to its name) probably adhered to a certain heretical
interpretation (zand) in preference to the orthodox Avesta and Zand.
Nêryôsang, in his Sanskrit version of Mkh. XXXVI, 16, explains a Zandîk
as one who 'thinks well of Aharman and the demons.'

<span id="fn_1489"></span>[297:2](sbe0566.htm#fr_1500.md) Unless this
paragraph be a continuation of the quotation from Kûshtanŏ-bû*g*ê*d*'s
commentary, which seems unlikely, its contents have an important bearing
upon the age of the Shâyast lâ-shâyast. As it does not mention
Muhammadanism by name it could hardly have been written after the fall
of the Sasanian dynasty, when that new faith had become much more
important, in Persia, than those of the Christians and Jews.
