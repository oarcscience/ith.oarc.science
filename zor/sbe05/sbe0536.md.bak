### CHAPTER XXVII.

1\. On the nature of plants it says in revelation, that, before the
coming of the destroyer, vegetation had no thorn and bark about it; and,
afterwards, when the destroyer came, it became coated with bark *and*
thorny <span id="fr_539"></span>[1](#fn_534.md), for antagonism mingled
with every single thing; owing to that cause vegetation is also much
mixed with poison, like Bi*s* the height of hemp (kand) <span
id="fr_540"></span>[2](#fn_535.md), that is poisonous, for men when they
eat *it* die.

2\. In like manner even as the animals, with grain of fifty and five
species *and* twelve species of medicinal plants, have arisen from the
primeval ox <span id="fr_541"></span>[3](#fn_536.md), ten thousand <span
id="fr_542"></span>[4](#fn_537.md) species among the species of principal

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

plants, *and* a hundred thousand species among *ordinary* plants have
grown from all these seeds of the tree opposed to harm <span
id="fr_543"></span>[1](#fn_538.md), the many-seeded, *which* has grown in
the wide-formed ocean. 3. When the seeds of all these plants, with those
from the primeval ox, have arisen upon it, every year the bird <span
id="fr_544"></span>[2](#fn_539.md) strips that tree *and* mingles all the
seeds in the water; Tî*s*tar seizes *them* with the rain-water and rains
*them on* to *all* regions. 4. Near to that tree the white Hôm, the
healing and undefiled, has grown at the source of the water of
Arêdvîvsûr <span id="fr_545"></span>[3](#fn_540.md); every one who eats
*it* becomes immortal, and they call it the Gôkar*d* <span
id="fr_546"></span>[4](#fn_541.md) tree, as it is said that Hôm is
expelling death <span id="fr_547"></span>[5](#fn_542.md); also in the
renovation *of the universe* they prepare its immortality
therefrom <span id="fr_548"></span>[6](#fn_543.md); *and* it is the chief
of plants <span id="fr_549"></span>[7](#fn_544.md).

5\. These are as many genera of plants as exist: trees and shrubs,
fruit-*trees*, corn, flowers, aromatic herbs, salads, spices, grass,
wild plants, medicinal

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

*plants*, gum *plants*, and all producing <span
id="fr_550"></span>[1](#fn_545.md) oil, dyes, *and* clothing. 6. I *will*
mention them also a second time: all whose fruit is not welcome as food
of men, *and* are perennial (sâlvâr), as the cypress, the plane, the
white poplar, the box, and others of this genus, they call trees and
shrubs (dâr va dirakht). 7. The produce of everything welcome as food of
men, *that* is perennial, as the date, the myrtle, the lote-plum <span
id="fr_551"></span>[2](#fn_546.md), the grape, the quince, the apple, the
citron, the pomegranate, the peach, the fig, the walnut, the almond,
*and* others in this genus, they call fruit (mîvak). 8. Whatever
requires labour with the spade <span id="fr_552"></span>[3](#fn_547.md),
*and* is perennial, they call a shrub (dirakht). 9. Whatever requires
that they take its crop through labour, *and its* root withers away,
such as wheat, barley, grain, various kinds <span
id="fr_553"></span>[4](#fn_548.md) of pulse, vetches, *and* others of this
genus, they call corn (*g*ûr*d*âk). 10. Every *plant with* fragrant
leaves, *which* is cultivated by the hand-labour of men, *and* is
perennial (hamvâr), they call an aromatic herb (siparam). 11. Whatever
sweet-scented blossom arises *at* various seasons through the
hand-labour of men, or has a perennial root *and* blossoms in *its*
season *with* new shoots *and* sweet-scented blossoms, as the rose, the
narcissus, the jasmine, the dog-rose (nêstarûn),

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

the tulip, the colocynth (kavastîk), the pandanus (kêdi), the *k*amba,
the ox-eye (hêri), the crocus, the swallow-wort (zarda), the violet, the
kârda, *and* others of this genus, they call a flower (gûl). 12.
Everything whose sweet-scented fruit, or sweet-scented blossom, arises
in *its* season, without the hand-labour of men, they call a wild plant
(vahâr or nihâl). 13. Whatever is welcome as food of cattle and beasts
*of burden*, they call grass (giyâh). 14. Whatever enters into cakes
(pê*s*-pârakîhâ) they call spices (âvzârîhâ). 15. Whatever is welcome in
eating of bread, as torn shoots <span id="fr_554"></span>[1](#fn_549.md) of
the coriander, water-cress (kakî*g*), the leek, *and* others of this
genus, they call salad (têrak) <span id="fr_555"></span>[2](#fn_550.md).
16. Whatever is like spinning <span id="fr_556"></span>[3](#fn_551.md)
cotton, *and* others of this genus, they call clothing *plants*
(*g*âmak). 17. Whatever lentil <span id="fr_557"></span>[4](#fn_552.md) is
greasy, as sesame, dûshdâng, hemp, zandak <span
id="fr_558"></span>[5](#fn_553.md), and others of this genus, they call an
oil-*seed* (rôkanô). 18. Whatever *one* can dye clothing with, as
saffron, sapan-wood, za*k*ava, vaha, *and* others of this genus, they
call a dye-*plant* (rag). 19. Whatever root, or gum <span
id="fr_559"></span>[6](#fn_554.md), or wood

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

is scented, as frankincense <span id="fr_560"></span>[1](#fn_555.md),
varâ*s*t <span id="fr_561"></span>[2](#fn_556.md), kust, sandalwood,
cardamom <span id="fr_562"></span>[3](#fn_557.md), camphor, orange-scented
mint, *and* others of this genus, they call a scent (bôd). 20. Whatever
stickiness comes out from plants <span id="fr_563"></span>[4](#fn_558.md)
they call gummy (za*d*ak). 21. The timber which proceeds, from the
trees, when it is either dry or wet, they call wood (*k*îbâ). 22. Every
one of all these plants which is so, they call medicinal (dârûk) <span
id="fr_564"></span>[5](#fn_559.md).

23\. The principal fruits are *of* thirty kinds (khadûînak), and ten
species (sar*d*ak) of them are fit to eat inside and outside, as the
fig, the apple, the quince, the citron, the grape, the mulberry, the
pear, *and* others of this kind; ten are fit to eat outside, *but* not
fit to eat inside, as the date, the peach, the white apricot, *and*
others of this kind; those which are fit to eat inside, *but* not fit to
eat outside, are the walnut, the almond, the pomegranate, the
cocoanut <span id="fr_565"></span>[6](#fn_560.md), the filbert <span
id="fr_566"></span>[7](#fn_561.md), the chesnut <span
id="fr_567"></span>[8](#fn_562.md), the pistachio nut, the vargân, *and*
whatever else of this description are very remarkable.

24 <span id="fr_568"></span>[9](#fn_563.md). This, too, it says, that every
single flower is appropriate to an angel (ameshôspend) <span
id="fr_569"></span>[10](#fn_564.md), as the

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

white <span id="fr_570"></span>[1](#fn_565) jasmine (saman.md) is for
Vohûman, the myrtle *and* jasmine (yâsmin) are Aûharmazd's own, the
mouse-ear (or sweet marjoram) is Ashavahi*s*t's <span
id="fr_571"></span>[2](#fn_566.md) own, the basil-royal is Shatvaîrô's own,
the musk flower is Spendarma*d*'s, the lily is Horvada*d*'s, the *k*amba
is Amerôda*d*'s, Dîn-*pavan-Âtarô* *has* the orange-scented mint
(vâ*d*rang-bôd), Âtarô *has* the marigold <span
id="fr_572"></span>[3](#fn_567) (âdargun.md), the water-lily is Âvân's, the
white marv is Khtûrshê*d*'s, the ranges <span
id="fr_573"></span>[4](#fn_568.md) is Mâh's, the violet is Tîr's, the
mêren <span id="fr_574"></span>[5](#fn_569.md) is Gô*s*'s, the kârda is
Dîn-pavan-Mitrô's, all violets are Mitrô's, the red chrysanthemum (khêr)
is Srôsh's, the dog-rose (nestran) is Rashnû's, the cockscomb is
Fravar*d*în's, the sisebar is Vâhrâm's, the yellow chrysanthemum is
Râm's, the orange-scented mint is Vâ*d*'s <span
id="fr_575"></span>[6](#fn_570.md), the trigonella is Dîn-pavan-Dîn's, the
hundred-petalled rose is Dîn's, all kinds of wild flowers (vahâr) are
Ar*d*'s <span id="fr_576"></span>[7](#fn_571.md), Â*s*tâ*d* *has* all the
white Hôm <span id="fr_577"></span>[8](#fn_572.md), the bread-baker's basil
is Asmân's, Zamyâ*d* *has* the crocus, Mâraspend *has the flower* <span
id="fr_578"></span>[9](#fn_573.md) of Ardashîr,

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Anîrân *has* this
Hôm of the angel Hôm <span id="fr_579"></span>[1](#fn_574.md), of three
kinds.

25\. It is concerning plants that every single kind *with* a drop of
water on a twig (teh) they should hold four finger-breadths in front of
the fire <span id="fr_580"></span>[2](#fn_575.md); Most of all it is the
lotos (kûnâr) they speak of.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_534"></span>[99:1](sbe0536.htm#fr_539.md) M6 has 'poisonous,'
but is evidently copied from an original almost illegible in some
places.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[99:2](sbe0536.htm#fr_540.md) Perhaps 'hemp the
height of Bî*s*' would better express the Pahlavi words, but Bî*s*
(Napellus Moysis) is often mentioned as a poisonous plant. The phrase
may also be translated 'like Bî*s* *and* tall hemp.'

<span id="fn_536"></span>[99:3](sbe0536.htm#fr_541.md) See Chap. XIV, 1.

<span id="fn_537"></span>[99:4](sbe0536.htm#fr_542.md) M6 has 'a thousand,'
but marks an omission. See Chap. IX. 4.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[100:1](sbe0536.htm#fr_543.md) See Chaps. IX, 5,
XVIII, 9, XXIX, 5.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[100:2](sbe0536.htm#fr_544.md) The apparently
contradictory account in Chap. IX, 2, refers only to the first
production of material plants from their spiritual or ideal
representative. The bird here mentioned is *K*amrô*s* (see Chaps. XIX,
15, XXIV, 29), as appears from the following passage (Mkh. LXII, 40-42):
'And the bird *K*amrô*s* for ever sits *in* that vicinity; and his work
is this, that he collects that seed which sheds from the tree of all
seeds, which is opposed to harm, and conveys *it* there where Tî*s*tar
seizes the water, so that Tî*s*tar may seize the water with that seed of
all kinds, and may rain *it* on the world with the rain.'

<span id="fn_540"></span>[100:3](sbe0536.htm#fr_545.md) See Chaps. XII, 5,
XIII, 3-5.

<span id="fn_541"></span>[100:4](sbe0536.htm#fr_546.md) Here written Gôkarn
in all MSS. See Chaps. IX, 6, XVIII, I, 2.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[100:5](sbe0536.htm#fr_547.md) That is, in Yas.
IX, where Haoma is entitled dûraosha.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[100:6](sbe0536.htm#fr_548.md) See Chap. XXIV, 27.

<span id="fn_544"></span>[100:7](sbe0536.htm#fr_549.md) See Chap. XXIV, 18.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[101:1](sbe0536.htm#fr_550.md) Comparing this list
with the subsequent repetition it appears probable that hamâk barâ is a
corruption of aesam bôd (see §§ 19, 21), and that we ought to read 'gum
*plants*, woods, scents, *and plants* for oil, dyes, *and* clothing.' M6
has 'oil *and* dyes for clothing.'

<span id="fn_546"></span>[101:2](sbe0536.htm#fr_551.md) The kûnâr (see
Chap. XV, 13).

<span id="fn_547"></span>[101:3](sbe0536.htm#fr_552.md) The Pâz. pêhani
(which is omitted in K20) is evidently a misreading of Pahl. pashang, 'a
hoe-like spade.'

<span id="fn_548"></span>[101:4](sbe0536.htm#fr_553.md) M6 adds Pâz. gavina
(Pahl. gûnak) to gvî*d* gvî*d* mungân, without altering the meaning
materially.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[102:1](sbe0536.htm#fr_554.md) Reading stâk
darî*d*; Justi has 'baked shoots;' Anquetil has 'the three following;'
M6 has stâk va karafs, 'shoots and parsley.'

<span id="fn_550"></span>[102:2](sbe0536.htm#fr_555.md) Or târak in § 5,
Pers. tarah.

<span id="fn_551"></span>[102:3](sbe0536.htm#fr_556.md) Reading Huz.
neskhunân, 'twisting,' but the word is doubtful. Justi has 'sitting *on
the plant*,' which is a rather singular description for cotton.

<span id="fn_552"></span>[102:4](sbe0536.htm#fr_557.md) Reading ma*k*ag;
Anquetil, Windischmann, and Justi read mazg, 'marrow,' but this is
usually written otherwise.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[102:5](sbe0536.htm#fr_558.md) Perhaps for zêtô,
'olive,' as Anquetil supposes, and Justi assumes.

<span id="fn_554"></span>[102:6](sbe0536.htm#fr_559.md) Reading tûf
(compare Pers. tuf, 'saliva').

<span id="fn_555"></span>[103:1](sbe0536.htm#fr_560.md) Pâz. kendri for
Pahl. kundur probably.

<span id="fn_556"></span>[103:2](sbe0536.htm#fr_561.md) Justi compares
Pers. bargha*s*t.

<span id="fn_557"></span>[103:3](sbe0536.htm#fr_562.md) Pâz. kâkura may be
equivalent to Pers. qaqulah, 'cardamoms,' or to Pers. kâkul or kâkûl,
'marjoram.'

<span id="fn_558"></span>[103:4](sbe0536.htm#fr_563.md) K20 omits a line,
from here to the word 'either.'

<span id="fn_559"></span>[103:5](sbe0536.htm#fr_564.md) The line which
contained this sentence is torn off in K20.

<span id="fn_560"></span>[103:6](sbe0536.htm#fr_565.md) Pâz. anârsar is a
misreading of Pahl. anârgîl (Pers. nârgîl, 'cocoa-nut').

<span id="fn_561"></span>[103:7](sbe0536.htm#fr_566.md) Pâz. pendak, a
misreading of Pahl. funduk.

<span id="fn_562"></span>[103:8](sbe0536.htm#fr_567.md) Pâz. shahbrôd, a
misreading of Pahl. shahbalût; omitted in M6.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[103:9](sbe0536.htm#fr_568.md) M6 begins a new
chapter here.

<span id="fn_564"></span>[103:10](sbe0536.htm#fr_569.md) These are the
thirty archangels and angels whose names are applied to the thirty days
of the Parsi month, in the order in <span id="page_104">p. 104</span>
which they are mentioned here, except that Aûharmazd is the first day,
and Vohûman is the second.

<span id="fn_565"></span>[104:1](sbe0536.htm#fr_570.md) M6 has 'yellow.'

<span id="fn_566"></span>[104:2](sbe0536.htm#fr_571.md) Synonymous with the
Ar*d*avahi*s*t of Chap. I, 26.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[104:3](sbe0536.htm#fr_572.md) Anquetil,
Windischmann, and Justi have 'the poppy.'

<span id="fn_568"></span>[104:4](sbe0536.htm#fr_573.md) M6 has Pâz. lg as
only the first part of the word, and Justi translates it by 'red lac,'
which is not a plant. Transcribing the Pâzand into Pahlavi, perhaps the
nearest probable word is rand, 'laurel.'

<span id="fn_569"></span>[104:5](sbe0536.htm#fr_574.md) M6 has Pâz. mênr;
Anquetil has 'vine blossom,' and is followed by Windischmann and Justi,
but the word is very uncertain.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[104:6](sbe0536.htm#fr_575.md) The remainder of
this chapter is lost from K20.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[104:7](sbe0536.htm#fr_576.md) This female angel
is also called Arshi*s*ang (see Chap. XXII, 4).

<span id="fn_572"></span>[104:8](sbe0536.htm#fr_577.md) See § 4.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[104:9](sbe0536.htm#fr_578.md) M6 leaves a blank
space for the name of the flower; perhaps it is the marv-i Ardashîrân.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[105:1](sbe0536.htm#fr_579.md) Reading, in
Pahlavi, Hôm yêdatô aê hôm.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[105:2](sbe0536.htm#fr_580.md) See Chap. XXI, 1.
Referring to the necessity of drying firewood before putting it on the
fire. The kûnâr is specially mentioned, as one of the first fire-woods
used by mankind, in Chap. XV, 13.
