### CHAPTER XIX.

1\. The Yathâ-ahû-vairyô <span id="fr_1923"></span>[1](#fn_1911.md)
*formulas* that are necessary in each place, and how *they* are to be
spoken in performing anything <span id="fr_1924"></span>[2](#fn_1912.md).

2\. One *by him* who goes forth to an assembly, or before grandees *and*
chieftains, or on any business; or when he goes to ask for what he wants
(val khvahî*s*nŏ); also when he quits any business; in each of these
situations *he* is to say only one *formula*, so that his business may
proceed more promptly <span id="fr_1925"></span>[3](#fn_1913.md).

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

3\. *That* a blessing (âfrînô) may be more benedictory, for this *reason
one* utters two *formulas*; for *there* are two kinds of blessing, one
is that which is in the thoughts <span
id="fr_1926"></span>[1](#fn_1914.md), and one is that which is in words.

4\. Four are for coming out more thankfully when at a
season-festival <span id="fr_1927"></span>[2](#fn_1915.md).

5\. Five *by him* who goes to atone for sin, in order to expel the
fiend; because it is necessary to undergo punishment by the decision
(dastôbarîh) of these five persons, the house-ruler, the village-ruler,
*the tribe-ruler* <span id="fr_1928"></span>[3](#fn_1916.md), the
province-ruler, and the supreme Zaratû*s*t; and five Ashem-vohûs <span
id="fr_1929"></span>[4](#fn_1917.md) are to be uttered by him at the end.

6\. Six *by him* who goes to seek power, and to battle, so that he may
be more successful.

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

7\. Seven *by him* who goes to perform the worship of God (yazdân), *so
that* the archangels may come more forward <span
id="fr_1930"></span>[1](#fn_1918.md) at the worship.

8\. Eight *by him* who goes to perform the ceremonial of the righteous
guardian spirit.

9\. Nine *by him* who goes to sow corn; these he utters for this
*reason*, because the corn will ripen (rasê*d*) in nine months, *and* so
that the corn may come forward he will make the mischief of the noxious
creatures less <span id="fr_1931"></span>[2](#fn_1919.md).

10\. Ten *by him* who goes to seek a wife, so that the presents may be
favourable for the purpose. 11. Ten *by him* who wishes to allow the
male *access* to beasts *of burden* and cattle, so that it may be more
procreative <span id="fr_1932"></span>[3](#fn_1920.md).

12\. Eleven *by him* who goes to the lofty mountains, so that the glory
of mountains and hills may bless him *and* be friendly <span
id="fr_1933"></span>[4](#fn_1921.md).

13\. Twelve *by him* who goes to the low districts, so that the glory of
that country and district may bless him and be friendly <span
id="fr_1934"></span>[5](#fn_1922.md).

14\. Thirteen *by him* who shall become pathless; *at* that same place
he shall utter *them*; or *by him*

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

who shall pass over a bridge and a river, so that the spirit of that
water may bless him <span id="fr_1935"></span>[1](#fn_1923.md); because the
Yathâ-ahû-vairyô is greater and more successful *than* everything in the
Avesta as to all rivers, all wholesomeness, and all protection.

15\. Religion is as connected with the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô as the hair is
more connected with the glory of the face; any one, indeed, would dread
(samâ*d*) to separate hairiness *and* the glory of the face.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1911"></span>[390:1](sbe0579.htm#fr_1923.md) See Bund. I, 21.

<span id="fn_1912"></span>[390:2](sbe0579.htm#fr_1924.md) It appears from
the ninth book of the Dînkar*d*, that the contents of this chapter are
derived from the first fargar*d* of the Sû*d*kar Nask (see B. Yt. I, 1,
note). The account given by the Dînkar*d* contains fewer details, but,
so far as it goes, it is in accordance with our text, except that it
seems to transfer the object of § 10 to § 12, and removes the objects of
§§ 12, 13 one step onwards; it also adds 'going on a bridge' to § 2. The
Persian Rivâyat of Bahman Pûn*g*yah gives further details, as will be
mentioned in the notes below.

<span id="fn_1913"></span>[390:3](sbe0579.htm#fr_1925.md) The Persian
Rivâyat adds to these occasions, when he goes on the water, or a river,
or goes to borrow, or to ask repayment of a loan, or goes out from his
house, or comes into it.

<span id="fn_1914"></span>[391:1](sbe0579.htm#fr_1926.md) The words pavan
mîni*s*n are guessed, for this first clause is omitted by mistake in M6,
and these two words are illegible in K20, except part of the last
letter.

<span id="fn_1915"></span>[391:2](sbe0579.htm#fr_1927.md) K20 substitutes
for val, 'at,' the following mutilated phrase \[. . . . aNh*a*u khshapô
ka*d*ar*k*âi pavan ka*d*âr*k*âî\] madam vazlûnê*d* râ*d*ih-i; the
portion in brackets being evidently a fragment from the Hâ*d*ôkht Srôsh
Yt. 5 with Pahlavi translation (a passage which treats of the efficacy
of reciting the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô). If this fragment be not merely a
marginal gloss, which has crept into the text by mistake, we must
translate the whole section as follows: 'Four are for the more thankful
coming out of the liberality of a season-festival, when the passage,
"*on that day nor* on that night *comes there* anything whatever on any
one," goes on.' The Dînkar*d* has merely: 'Four by *him* who is at the
invocation of the chiefs *of creation and* the celebration of a
season-festival.' The Persian Rivâyats omit the section altogether.

<span id="fn_1916"></span>[391:3](sbe0579.htm#fr_1928.md) This person is
omitted both in M6 and K20, but he is wanted to make up the five. This
section is omitted by the Persian Rivâyats.

<span id="fn_1917"></span>[391:4](sbe0579.htm#fr_1929.md) See Bund. XX, 2.
These are to be recited after the punishment is over.

<span id="fn_1918"></span>[392:1](sbe0579.htm#fr_1930.md) Or 'may arrive
earlier;' there being seven archangels has suggested the number seven.
This section and the next are omitted by the Persian Rivâyats.

<span id="fn_1919"></span>[392:2](sbe0579.htm#fr_1931.md) The Persian
Rivâyats add general cultivation, planting trees, and cohabitation with
one's wife.

<span id="fn_1920"></span>[392:3](sbe0579.htm#fr_1932.md) Instead of §§ 10,
11 the Persian Rivâyats have buying quadrupeds, and driving pegs into
the ground for picketing them.

<span id="fn_1921"></span>[392:4](sbe0579.htm#fr_1933.md) The Persian
Rivâyats substitute conference with a maiden, seeking a wife, giving
one's children in marriage, and obtaining anything from another.

<span id="fn_1922"></span>[392:5](sbe0579.htm#fr_1934.md) The Persian
Rivâyats add going up hills, mounting anything lofty, going on a bridge,
and losing one's way.

<span id="fn_1923"></span>[393:1](sbe0579.htm#fr_1935.md) The Persian
Rivâyats substitute going to and entering a city or town; they also add
twenty-one recitations on setting out on a journey, so that the angel
Bahrâm may grant a safe arrival.
