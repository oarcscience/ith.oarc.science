### CHAPTER III.

1\. And Gô*s*ûrvan, as she was herself the soul of the primeval ox, when
the ox passed away, came out from the ox, even as the soul from the body
of the dead, and kept up the clamour of a cry to Aûharmazd in such
fashion as that of an army, a thousand strong, when they cry out
together <span id="fr_938"></span>[3](#fn_932). 2. And Aûharmazd, in
order to be much more able to keep watch over the mingled creatures than
in front of Gâyômar*d*, went from the earth up to the sky. 3. And
Gô*s*ûrvan continually went after him crying, and she kept up the cry
thus: 'With whom may the guardianship over the creatures be left by
thee?'
