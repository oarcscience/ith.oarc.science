### CHAPTER VI.

1\. On the conflict <span id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_119.md) of the
creations of the world with the: antagonism of the evil spirit it is
said in revelation, that the evil spirit, even as he rushed in and
looked upon the pure bravery of the angels and his own violence <span
id="fr_120"></span>[2](#fn_120.md), wished to rush back. 2. The spirit of
the sky is himself like one of the warriors who has put on armour; he
arrayed the sky against the evil. spirit, and led on in the contest,
until Aûharmazd had completed a rampart around, stronger than the sky
and in front of the sky. 3. And his guardian spirits (fravâhar) of
warriors and the righteous, on war horses and spear in hand, were around
the sky; such-like as the hair on the head is the similitude
(ângunî-aîtak) of those who hold the watch of the rampart. 4. And no
passage was found by the evil spirit, who rushed back; and he beheld the
annihilation of the demons and his own impotence, as Aûharmazd, *did*
his own final triumph, producing the renovation *of the universe* for
ever and everlasting.
