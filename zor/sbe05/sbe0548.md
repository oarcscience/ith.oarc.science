### CHAPTER IV.

1\. This was the highest predominance of Aharman, for he came on, with
all the strength which he

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

had, for the disfigurement of the creatures; and he took as much as
one-third of the base of the sky <span id="fr_939"></span>[1](#fn_933.md),
in a downward direction, into a confined *and* captive state, so that it
was all dark *and* apart from the light, for it was itself, at the
coming of the adversary, *his* enemy among the struggles for creation.
2. And this is opposing the renovation *of the universe*, for the
greatest of all the other means of the fiend, when he *has* come in, are
of like origin and strength this day, in the sleep <span
id="fr_940"></span>[2](#fn_934.md) of the renovation, *as on* that when the
enemy, who is fettered on coming in, is kept back.

3\. Amid all this struggling were mingled the instigations of Aharman,
*crying* thus: 'My victory *has* come completely, for the sky is split
and disfigured by me with gloom and darkness, and taken by me as a
stronghold; water is disfigured by me, and the earth, injured by
darkness, is pierced by me; vegetation is withered by me, the ox is put
to death by me, Gâyômar*d* is made ill by me, and opposed to those
revolving <span id="fr_941"></span>[3](#fn_935.md) are the glooms and
planets arranged by me; no one *has* remained for me to take *and*
pervert in combat except Aûharmazd, and of the earth *there* is only one
man, who is alone, what is he able to do?'

4\. And he sends Astô-vîdâ*d* <span id="fr_942"></span>[4](#fn_936.md) upon
him with the thousand decrepitudes (aûzvârânŏ) *and* diseases

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

which are his own, sicknesses of various kinds, so that they may make
him ill *and* cause death. 5. Gâyômar*d* was not secured by them, and
the reason was because it was a decree of appointing Time (zôrvânŏ) in
the beginning of the coming in of Aharman, that: 'Up to thirty winters I
appoint Gâyômar*d* unto brilliance and preservation of life.' 6. And his
manifestation in the *celestial* sphere was through the forgiveness of
criminals *and* instigators of confusion by *his* good works, and for
that reason no opportunity was obtained by them during the extent of
thirty years.

7\. For in the beginning it was so appointed that the star Jupiter
(Aûharmazd) was life towards the creatures, not through its own nature,
but on account of *its* being within the control (band) of the
luminaries <span id="fr_943"></span>[1](#fn_937); and Saturn (Kêvân.md) was
death towards the creatures. 8. Both were in their supremacy
(bâlîst) <span id="fr_944"></span>[2](#fn_938.md) at the beginning of the
creatures,

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

as Jupiter was in Cancer on rising, that which is also called *G*îvân
('living") <span id="fr_945"></span>[1](#fn_939.md), for it is the place in
which life is bestowed upon it; *and* Saturn was in Libra, in the great
subterranean, so that its own venom and deadliness *became* more evident
and more dominant thereby. 9. And it was when both shall not be supreme
*that* Gâyômar*d* was to complete his own life, which is the thirty
years <span id="fr_946"></span>[2](#fn_940.md) Saturn came not again to
supremacy, that is, *to* Libra. 10. And at the time when Saturn came
into Libra, Jupiter was in Capricornus <span
id="fr_947"></span>[3](#fn_941.md), on account of whose own lowness <span
id="fr_948"></span>[4](#fn_942.md), and the victory of Saturn over Jupiter,
Gâyômar*d* suffered through those very defects which came and are to
continue advancing, the continuance of that disfigurement which Aharman
can bring upon the creatures of Aûharmazd.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_933"></span>[164:1](sbe0548.htm#fr_939.md) Compare Bund. III,
11. The involved style of Zâ*d*-sparam is particularly conspicuous in
this chapter.

<span id="fn_934"></span>[164:2](sbe0548.htm#fr_940.md) The word seems to
be khvâpi*s*nŏ.

<span id="fn_935"></span>[164:3](sbe0548.htm#fr_941.md) Meaning probably
the zodiacal signs, but the word is doubtful, being spelt vardi*s*nânŏ
instead of var*d*i*s*nânŏ. A very small alteration would change it into
varôî*s*nânŏ, 'believers,' but there were no earthly believers at the
time alluded to.

<span id="fn_936"></span>[164:4](sbe0548.htm#fr_942.md) See Bund. III, 21,
and XXVIII, 35.

<span id="fn_937"></span>[165:1](sbe0548.htm#fr_943.md) These luminaries
are the fixed stars, especially the signs of the zodiac, to whose
protection the good creation is committed (see Bund. II, 0-4); whereas
Jupiter and all other planets are supposed to be, by nature, disturbers
of the creation, being employed by Aharman for that purpose (see Mkh.
VIII, 17-21, XII, 7-10, XXIV, 8, XXXIII, 5).

<span id="fn_938"></span>[165:2](sbe0548.htm#fr_944.md) The most obvious
meaning of bâlîst is 'greatest altitude,' and this is quite applicable
to Jupiter when it attains its highest northern declination on entering
Cancer, but it is not applicable to Saturn in Libra, when it has only
its mean altitude. At the vernal equinox, however, which was the time of
the beginning mentioned in the text, when Aharman invaded the creation
(see Chap. II, 1), Libra is in opposition to the sun, and Saturn in
Libra would be at its nearest approach to the earth, and would,
therefore, attain its maximum brightness; while Jupiter in Cancer would
be at its greatest altitude and shining with four-fifths of its maximum
brightness. Both planets, therefore, were near their most conspicuous
position (which would seem to be the meaning of bâlîst <span
id="page_166">p. 166</span> here), and might each be supposed to the
exercising its maximum astrological influence, so that the presumed
deadly power of Saturn would be neutralised by the supposed reviving
influence of Jupiter.

<span id="fn_939"></span>[166:1](sbe0548.htm#fr_945.md) This reading suits
the context best, but the name can also be read Snahan, and in many
other ways. It may possibly be the tenth lunar mansion, whose name is
read Nahn in Bund. II, 3, by Pâzand writers, and which corresponds to
the latter part of Cancer.

<span id="fn_940"></span>[166:2](sbe0548.htm#fr_946.md) Saturn revolves
round the sun in about 29 years and 167 days, so it cannot return into
opposition to the sun (or to its maximum brightness), at or near the
vernal equinox, in less than thirty years.

<span id="fn_941"></span>[166:3](sbe0548.htm#fr_947.md) That is, while
Saturn performs one revolution round the sun, Jupiter performs two and a
half, which is very nearly correct, as Jupiter revolves round the sun in
about 11 years and 315 days. Therefore, when the supposed deadly
influence of Saturn has returned to its maximum, the supposed reviving
influence of Jupiter is at its minimum, owing to the small altitude of
Capricornus, and no longer counterbalances the destructive power of
Saturn.

<span id="fn_942"></span>[166:4](sbe0548.htm#fr_948.md) There seems to be
no other reasonable translation, but the MS. has lâ instead of râî, and
ni*s*kasp instead of ni*s*î*v*.
