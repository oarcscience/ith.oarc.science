### CHAPTER XXII.

1\. On the nature of lakes it says in revelation, that thus many
fountains of waters have come into notice, which they call lakes (var);
counterparts of the eyes (*k*ashm) of men are those fountains
(*k*ashmak) of waters; such as Lake *K*ê*k*ast, Lake Sôvbar, Lake
Khvâri*z*em <span id="fr_461"></span>[3](#fn_457.md), Lake Frazdân, Lake
Zarînmand, Lake Âsvast, Lake Husru, Lake Satavês, Lake Urvis.

2\. I *will* mention them also a second time: Lake *K*ê*k*ast <span
id="fr_462"></span>[4](#fn_458.md) is in Âtarô-pâtakân, warm is the water
*and* opposed to harm, so that nothing whatever is living in *it*; and
its source is connected with the wide-formed ocean <span
id="fr_463"></span>[5](#fn_459.md). 3. Lake Sôvbar is in the upper district
and country on the summit of the mountain of Tûs <span
id="fr_464"></span>[6](#fn_460.md); as it says, that the Sû*d*-bâhar <span
id="fr_465"></span>[7](#fn_461) ('share of benefit'.md) is propitious and
good from which abounding

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

liberality is produced. 4. Regarding Lake Khvâri*z*em <span
id="fr_466"></span>[1](#fn_462.md) it says that excellent benefit is
produced from it, *that is*, Arshi*s*ang <span
id="fr_467"></span>[2](#fn_463.md) the rich in wealth, the well-portioned
*with* abounding pleasure. 5. Lake Frazdân <span
id="fr_468"></span>[3](#fn_464.md) is in Sagastân; they say, where a
generous man, *who is* righteous, throws anything into it, it receives
*it*; when not righteous, it throws *it* out again; its source also is
connected with the wide-formed *ocean*. 6. Lake Zarînmand is in
Hama*d*ân <span id="fr_469"></span>[4](#fn_465.md). 7. Regarding Lake
Âsvast it is declared that the undefiled <span
id="fr_470"></span>[5](#fn_466.md) water which it contains is always
constantly flowing into the sea, so bright and copious <span
id="fr_471"></span>[6](#fn_467.md) that *one* might say that the sun had
come into it *and* looked at Lake Âsvast, into that water which is
requisite for restoring the dead in the renovation *of the universe*. 8.
Lake Husru <span id="fr_472"></span>[7](#fn_468.md) is within fifty <span
id="fr_473"></span>[8](#fn_469.md)

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

leagues (parasang). of Lake *K*ê*k*ast. 9. Lake (or, rather, Gulf)
Satavês <span id="fr_474"></span>[1](#fn_470.md) is that *already* written
*about*, between the wide-formed ocean *and* the Pûtîk. 10. It is said
that in Kamîndân is an abyss (zafar), from which everything they throw
in always comes *back*, and it *will* not receive it unless alive
(*g*ânvar); when they throw a living creature into it, it carries *it*
down; men say that a fountain from hell is in it. 11. Lake Urvis is on
Hûgar the lofty <span id="fr_475"></span>[2](#fn_471.md).

water is salt.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[85:6](sbe0531.htm#fr_464.md) The Kôndrâsp

water on the mountains near Meshhed.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[85:7](sbe0531.htm#fr_465.md) Evidently a punning
etymology of the name of this lake.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[86:1](sbe0531.htm#fr_466.md) The province of
Khvâri*z*em was between the Aral and Caspian, along the ancient course
of the Oxus (see Chap. XVII, 5). This lake has been identified with the
Aral.

'good rectitude,' personified as a female angel whose praises are
celebrated in the Ashi Ya*s*t; in later times she has been considered as
the angel dispensing wealth and possessions. She is also called Ar*d*
(Av. areta, which is synonymous with asha), see Chap. XXVII, 24.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[86:3](sbe0531.htm#fr_468.md) The 'Frazdânava
water' of Âbân Yt. 108 and Farhang-i Oîm-khadûk, p. 17. Justi identifies

here represented as a salt lake.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[86:4](sbe0531.htm#fr_469.md) K20 adds, 'they
say.' This lake cannot be the spring Zarînmand of Chap. XX, 34.

<span id="fn_466"></span>[86:5](sbe0531.htm#fr_470.md) Pâz. avnasti
transcribed into Pahlavi is avinastag, 'unspoiled,' the equivalent of
Av. anâhita in Yas. LXIV, 1, 16, Visp. I, 18.
