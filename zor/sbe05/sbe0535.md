### CHAPTER XXVI.

1\. A Hâsar <span id="fr_536"></span>[1](#fn_531.md) on the ground is a
Parasang of one thousand steps of the two feet. 2. A Parasang <span
id="fr_537"></span>[2](#fn_532.md) is a measure as much as a far-seeing man
may look out, see a beast *of burden, and* make known that *it* is black
or white. 3. And the measure of a man is eight medium spans <span
id="fr_538"></span>[3](#fn_533.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_531"></span>[98:1](sbe0535.htm#fr_536.md) Av. hâthra of Vend.
II, 65, VIII, 280, 287, 291, Tî*s*tar Yt. 23, 29. The statements
regarding the length of a Hâsar are rather perplexing, for we are told
that it 'is like a Parasang' (Chap. XIV, 4), that 'the length of a Hâsar
is one-fourth of a Parasang' (Chap. XVI, 7), and that 'a medium Hâsar on
the ground, which they also call a Parasang, is a thousand steps of the
two feet when walking with propriety' (Farhang-i Oîm-khadûk, ed. Hosh.
p. 42). To reconcile these statements we must conclude that the Hâsar is
like a Parasang merely in the sense of being a long measure of distance,
that it is really the mille passus or mile of the Romans, and that it is
a quarter of the actual Parasang. At the same time, as it was usual to
call a Hâsar by the name of a Parasang, we are often left in doubt
whether a mile or a league is meant, when a Hâsar or Parasang is
mentioned. The Farhang-i Oîm-khadûk (p. 41) also mentions other measures
of distance, such as the ta*k*ar (Av. ta*k*ara) of two Hâsars, the
asvâst (or aêast) of four Hâsars, the dashmêst (Av. dakhshmaiti) of
eight, Hâsars, and the yô*g*êst (Av. yi*g*aiasti or yu*g*aiasti) of
sixteen Hâsars.

<span id="fn_532"></span>[98:2](sbe0535.htm#fr_537.md) A Parasang is
usually from 3½ to 4 English miles, but perhaps a Hâsar is meant here.

<span id="fn_533"></span>[98:3](sbe0535.htm#fr_538.md) Reading vitast-i
miyânak instead of vitast damânak. The Farhang-i Oîm-khadûk (p. 41)
mentions three kinds of spans, the Av. vitasti (Vend. VIII, 243, 245,
XVII, 13) of twelve finger-breadths (angûst), or about 9 inches, which
is a full span between the thumb and little finger (the one mentioned in
the text); the Av. di*s*ti (Vend. XVII, 13) of ten finger-breadths, or
about 7½ inches, which is a span between the thumb and middle finger;
and the <span id="page_99">p. 99</span> Av. uza*s*ti (Pahl. lâlâ-a*s*t)
of eight finger-breaths, or about 6 inches which is a span between the
thumb and fore-finger. Other measures mentioned by the same authority
are the pâî (Av. padha, Vend. IX, 15, 20, 29), 'foot,' of fourteen
finger-breadths, or about 10½ inches; the gâm (Av. gâya, Vend. III, 57,
&c.), 'step,' which 'in the Vendîdâd is three pâî,' or about 2 feet 7½
inches, 'and in other places is said *to be* two frârâst' (Av. frârâthni
in Vend. VII, 76, 79, 87); so the frârâst, which is probably the
distance from the neck to the extended elbow, is half a gâm, or from 15
to 16 inches. Two other measures are mentioned in Vend. VII, 7 9, 87,
90, IX, 8, the Av. frâbâzu, 'fore-arm or cubit' from elbow to
finger-ends, which is about 18 inches (or it may be a half fathom); and
Av. vîbâzu, which is probably the 'fathom,' or extent of the two arms
out-stretched, from 5½ to 6 feet.
