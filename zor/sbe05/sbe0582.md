### CHAPTER XXII <span id="fr_1967"></span>[1](#fn_1955.md).

vigorous!

17\. May Srôsh the righteous, the smiter of demons, keep greed, wrath,

18\. May Rashnû be thy conductor <span id="fr_1974"></span>[5](#fn_1962.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1955"></span>[401:1](sbe0582.htm#fr_1967.md) These last two
chapters are found written upon some folios which have been added to the
beginning of M6; but, though not belonging to that MS. originally, they
are still very old. The first of these two chapters has not been found
elsewhere; it is an elaborate benediction, in which the writer calls
down, upon some one, a series of blessings from each of the thirty
archangels and angels whose names are given to the days of the Parsi
month in the order in which they here stand (compare the same names in
Bund. XXVII, 24).

<span id="fn_1956"></span>[401:2](sbe0582.htm#fr_1968.md) The meaning of
the word pâ*d*rô*g* or pâ*d*ran*g* (which occurs also in §§ 12, 26, and
appears to be a title) may be guessed from the following passage in the
Yâ*d*kâr-i Zarîrân, or Vi*s*tâsp-shâh-nâmak: Pavan har ra*z*m va
pâ*d*ra*z*m-i lak pîrô*g* va vêh pâ*d*rô*g* *s*em yâîtûnî-ae, 'in every
attack and counter-attack of thine mayest thou bring *away* the title of
conqueror and good champion!'

<span id="fn_1957"></span>[401:3](sbe0582.htm#fr_1969.md) The reading is
uncertain.

<span id="fn_1958"></span>[402:1](sbe0582.htm#fr_1970.md) This verb is
doubtful; here and in § 23 it is netrûnâ*d*, 'may she guard,' but in §
15 it is ketrûnâ*d*, 'may she remain.'

<span id="fn_1959"></span>[402:2](sbe0582.htm#fr_1971.md) Bûr*z* âtarô,
'the sublime fire,' seems to be a personification of the fire
Berezi-savang of Bund. XVII, 1; 3, the Supremely-benefiting of SZS. XI,
1, 6.

<span id="fn_1960"></span>[402:3](sbe0582.htm#fr_1972.md) She is usually
called an angel. Either the verb is omitted in this section, or it is
not a blessing; and the same may be said of §§ 20, 25.

<span id="fn_1961"></span>[402:4](sbe0582.htm#fr_1973.md) These are the
three fiends, Â*z*, Aeshm, and Nîyâz (see Bund. XXVIII, 15-17, 26, 27).

<span id="fn_1962"></span>[402:5](sbe0582.htm#fr_1974.md) It is very
possible that the verb should be yehabûnâ*d*, <span id="page_403">p.
403</span> instead of yehevûnâ*d*, in which case we should have 'give
thee a passport.'

<span id="fn_1963"></span>[403:1](sbe0582.htm#fr_1975.md) The meaning of
khvâpar (Av. *hv*âpara) is by no means certain; it is an epithet of
Aûharmazd, angels, and spirits, and is then often assumed to mean
'protecting;' but it is also a term applied to the earth and offspring;
perhaps 'self-sustaining' would suit both its etymology and its various
applications best, but the root par has many other meanings.

<span id="fn_1964"></span>[403:2](sbe0582.htm#fr_1976.md) That is, two
great cycles. It is usual for the copyists of Pahlavi MSS. to wish, in
their colophons, that the persons for whom the MSS. are written, whether
themselves or others, may retain the MSS. for a hundred and fifty years
before leaving them to their children; which period is mentioned because
it is supposed to constitute a great cycle of the moon and planets.

<span id="fn_1965"></span>[403:3](sbe0582.htm#fr_1977.md) Written drûd
instead of drû*d*.

<span id="fn_1966"></span>[404:1](sbe0582.htm#fr_1978.md) Both nouns are in
the plural, and both verbs in the singular. Anîrân is a personification
of Av. anaghra rao*ka*u, 'the beginningless lights,' or fixed stars
(which, however, are said to have been created by Aûharmazd in Bund. II,
1), and these stars appear to have been considered as horses of the
angels (Bund. VI, 3, SZS. VI, 1). There are several uncertain phrases in
§§ 30-32.

<span id="fn_1967"></span>[404:2](sbe0582.htm#fr_1979.md) This would appear
to be the name of the person to whom the benediction is addressed, as it
can hardly be meant for the ancient hero Thrita, the Athrat of Bund.
XXXI, 27, and the Srîtô of SZS. XI, 10, note.
