### CHAPTER III.

1\. On the rush of the destroyer at the creatures it is said, in
revelation, that the evil spirit, when he saw the impotence of himself
and the confederate <span id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_82) (hâm-dast.md)
demons, owing to the righteous man <span id="fr_83"></span>[2](#fn_83.md),
became confounded, *and* seemed in confusion three thousand years. 2.
During that confusion the archfiends <span id="fr_84"></span>[3](#fn_84.md)
of the demons severally shouted thus: 'Rise up, *thou* father of us! for
we *will* cause a conflict in the world, the distress and injury from
which *will* become those of Aûharmazd and the archangels.'

3\. Severally they twice recounted their own evil deeds, and it pleased
him not; and that wicked evil spirit, through fear of the righteous man,
was not able to lift up *his* head until the wicked *G*êh <span
id="fr_85"></span>[4](#fn_85.md) came, at the completion of the three
thousand years. 4. And she shouted to the evil spirit thus: 'Rise up,
*thou* father of us! for I *will* cause that conflict in the world
wherefrom the distress and injury of Aûharmazd and the archangels *will*
arise.' 5. And she twice recounted severally her own evil deeds, and it
pleased him not; and that wicked evil spirit

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

rose not from that confusion, through fear of the righteous man.

6\. And, again, the wicked *G*êh shouted thus: 'Rise up, *thou* father
of us! for in that conflict I *will* shed thus much vexation <span
id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86.md) on the righteous man and the labouring ox
that, through my deeds, life *will* not be wanted, and I will destroy
their living souls (nismô) <span id="fr_87"></span>[2](#fn_87.md); I *will*
vex the water, I *will* vex the plants, I *will* vex the fire of
Aûharmazd, I *will* make the whole creation of Aûharmazd vexed.' 7. And
she so recounted those evil deeds a second time, that the evil spirit
was delighted and started up from that confusion; and he kissed *G*êh
upon the head, and the pollution which they call menstruation became
apparent in *G*êh.

8\. He shouted to *G*êh thus: 'What is thy wish? so that I may give *it*
thee.' And *G*êh shouted to the evil spirit thus: 'A man is the wish, so
give *it* to me.'

9\. The form of the evil spirit was a log-like lizard's (vazak) body,
and he appeared a young man of fifteen years to *G*êh, and that brought
the thoughts of *G*êh to him <span id="fr_88"></span>[3](#fn_88.md).

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

10\. Afterwards, the evil spirit, with the confederate demons, went
towards the luminaries, and he saw the sky; and he led them up, fraught
with malicious intentions. 11. He stood upon one-third <span
id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_89.md) of the inside of the sky, and he sprang,
like a snake, out of the sky down to the earth.

12\. *In* the month Fravar*d*în and the day Aûharmazd <span
id="fr_90"></span>[2](#fn_90.md) he rushed in at noon, and thereby the sky
was as shattered and frightened by him, as a sheep by a wolf. 13. He
came on to the water which was arranged <span
id="fr_91"></span>[3](#fn_91.md) below the earth, and then the middle of
this earth was pierced *and* entered by him. 14. Afterwards, he came to
the vegetation, then to the ox, then to Gâyômar*d*, and then he came to
fire <span id="fr_92"></span>[4](#fn_92.md); so, just like a fly, he rushed
out upon the whole creation; and he made the world quite as injured and
dark <span id="fr_93"></span>[5](#fn_93.md) at midday as though it were in
dark night. 15. And noxious creatures. were diffused by him over the
earth, biting and venomous, such as the snake, scorpion, frog (kalvâk),
and lizard (vazak),—so that not so much as the point of a needle
remained *free* from noxious creatures. 16. And blight <span
id="fr_94"></span>[6](#fn_94.md) was diffused by him over the

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

vegetation, and it withered away immediately. 17. And avarice, want,
pain, hunger, disease, lust, and lethargy were diffused by him abroad
upon the ox and Gâyômar*d*.

18\. Before *his* coming to the ox, Aûharmazd ground up the healing
fruit <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95.md), which some call 'bînâk,'
small in water openly before *its* eyes, so that *its* damage *and*
discomfort from the calamity (zani*s*n) might be less; and when it
became at the same time lean and ill, as *its* breath went forth and it
passed away, the ox also spoke thus: 'The cattle are to be created,
*and* their work, labour, and care are to be appointed.'

19\. And before *his* coming to Gâyômar*d*, Aûharmazd brought forth a
sweat upon Gâyômar*d*, so long as he might recite a prayer (vâ*g*) of
one stanza (vi*k*ast); moreover, Aûharmazd formed that sweat into the
youthful body of a man of fifteen years, radiant *and* tall. 20. When
Gâyômar*d* issued from the sweat he saw the world dark as night, and the
earth as though not a needle's point remained *free from* noxious
creatures; the *celestial* sphere was in revolution, *and* the sun and
moon remained in motion: *and* the world's struggle, owing to the
clamour of the Mâzînâkân demons <span id="fr_96"></span>[2](#fn_96.md), was
with the constellations.

21\. And the evil spirit thought that the creatures of Aûharmazd were
all rendered useless except

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Gâyômar*d*; and
Astô-vîdâ*d* <span id="fr_97"></span>[1](#fn_97.md) with a thousand demons,
causers of death, were let forth by him on Gâyômar*d*, 22. But his
appointed time had not come, *and* he (Astô-vîdâ*d*) obtained no means
of noosing (âvi*z*î*d*anŏ) *him*; as it is said that, when the
opposition of the evil spirit came, the period of the life and rule of
Gâyômar*d* was appointed for thirty years. 23. After the coming of the
adversary he lived thirty years, and Gâyômar*d* spoke thus: 'Although
the destroyer *has* come, mankind *will* be all of my race; and this one
thing is good, when they perform duty and good works.'

24\. And, afterwards, he (the evil spirit) came to fire, and he mingled
smoke and darkness with it. 25. The planets, with many demons, dashed
against the *celestial* sphere, and they mixed the constellations; and
the whole creation was as disfigured as though fire disfigured every
place and smoke arose over *it*. 26. And ninety days *and* nights the
heavenly angels were contending in the world with the confederate demons
of the evil spirit, *and* hurled *them* confounded to hell; and the
rampart of the sky was formed so that the adversary should not be able
to mingle with it.

27\. Hell is in the middle of the earth; there where the evil spirit
pierced the earth <span id="fr_98"></span>[2](#fn_98.md) and rushed in upon
it, as all the possessions of the world were

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

changing into duality, *and* persecution, contention, and mingling of
high and low became manifest.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_82"></span>[15:1](sbe0512.htm#fr_82.md) The Pâzand MSS. have
garôist, for the Huz. hêmnunast, 'trusted.' Windischmann and Justi have
'all.'

<span id="fn_83"></span>[15:2](sbe0512.htm#fr_83.md) Probably Gâyômar*d*.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[15:3](sbe0512.htm#fr_84.md) The word kamârakân is
literally 'those with an evil pate,' and is derived from Av. kameredha,
'the head of an evil being,' also applied to 'the evil summit' of Mount
Arezûra (Vend. XIX, 140, 142), which is supposed to be at the gate of
hell (see Chap. XII, 8). That the chief demons or arch-fiends are meant,
appears, more clearly in Chap. XXVIII, 12, 44, where the word is
kamârîkân.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[15:4](sbe0512.htm#fr_85.md) The personification of
the impurity of menstruation.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[16:1](sbe0512.htm#fr_86.md) The word vêsh or vîsh
may stand either for bêsh, 'distress, vexation,' as here assumed, or for
vish, 'poison,' as translated by Windischmann and Justi in accordance
with the Paz. MSS.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[16:2](sbe0512.htm#fr_87.md) That this is the
Huzvâri*s* of rûbân, 'soul,' appears from Chap. XV, 3-5, where both
words are used indifferently; but it is not given in the Huz.-Pâz.
Glossary. It is evidently equivalent to Chald. ni*s*mâ, and ought
probably to have the traditional pronunciation nisman, an abbreviation
of nismman.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[16:3](sbe0512.htm#fr_88.md) This seems to be the
literal meaning of the sentence, and is confirmed by Chap. XXVIII, 1,
but Windischmann and Justi understand that the evil spirit formed a
youth for *G*êh out of a toad's body. The incident in the text may be
compared with Milton's idea of Satan and Sin in Paradise Lost, Book II,
745-765.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[17:1](sbe0512.htm#fr_89.md) Perhaps referring to
the proportion of the sky which is overspread by the darkness of night.
The whole sentence is rather obscure.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[17:2](sbe0512.htm#fr_90.md) The vernal equinox
(see Chap. XXV, 7).

<span id="fn_91"></span>[17:3](sbe0512.htm#fr_91.md) Literally, 'and it was
arranged.'

<span id="fn_92"></span>[17:4](sbe0512.htm#fr_92.md) For the details of
these visitations, see Chaps. VI-X.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[17:5](sbe0512.htm#fr_93.md) Reading khûst tôm; but
it may be hangî*d*tûm, 'most turbid, opaque.'

<span id="fn_94"></span>[17:6](sbe0512.htm#fr_94.md) The word makhâ, 'blow,
stroke,' is a Huzvâri*s* logogram not found in the glossaries; M6 has
dâr, 'wood,' but this may be a misreading, due to the original, from
which M6 was copied, being difficult to read.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[18:1](sbe0512.htm#fr_95.md) The word mîvang is an
unusual form of mîvak, 'fruit.' It is probably to be traced to an Av.
mivangh, which might mean 'fatness,' as Windischmann suggests.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[18:2](sbe0512.htm#fr_96.md) The Mâzainya daêva of
the Avesta, and Mâzendarân demons, or idolators, of Persian legends.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[19:1](sbe0512.htm#fr_97.md) The demon of death,
Astô-vîdhôtu in the Avesta (Vend. IV, 137, V, 25, 31), who is supposed
'to cast a halter around the necks of the dead to drag them to hell, but
if their good works have exceeded their sins they throw off the noose
and go to heaven' (Haug's Essays, 2nd ed. p. 321). This name is misread
Asti-vihâ*d* by Pâzand writers.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[19:2](sbe0512.htm#fr_98.md) See § 13.
