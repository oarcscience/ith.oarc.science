### CHAPTER X.

0\. On the conflict waged with the primeval ox.

1\. As it passed away <span id="fr_149"></span>[5](#fn_149), owing to
the vegetable principle (*k*îharak) *proceeding*, from every limb of the
ox, fifty and five species of grain <span
id="fr_150"></span>[6](#fn_150) *and* twelve species of medicinal plants
grew forth from the earth, and their splendour and strength were the

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

seminal energy (tôkhmîh) of the ox. 2. Delivered to the moon
station <span id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_151), that seed was thoroughly
purified by the light of the moon, fully prepared in every way, and
produced life in a body. 3. Thence *arose* two oxen, one male *and* one
female; and, afterwards, two hundred and eighty-two species of each
kind <span id="fr_152"></span>[2](#fn_152) became manifest upon the
earth. 4. The dwelling (mânîst) of the birds is in the air, and the fish
are in the midst of the water.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_149"></span>[31:5](sbe0519.htm#fr_149) See Chap. IV, 1.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[31:6](sbe0519.htm#fr_150) See Chaps. XIV, 1,
XXVII, 2.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[32:1](sbe0519.htm#fr_151) See Chap. XIV, 3. In
the Mâh Yt. 0, 7, blessings are invoked for 'the moon of ox lineage'
(gao*k*ithra) in conjunction with the 'sole-created ox and the ox of
many species.' In the Avesta the gender of these two primeval oxen
appears doubtful, owing probably to the dual gen. masc. of their
epithets being of the same form as a sing. gen. fem.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[32:2](sbe0519.htm#fr_152) That is, of each
sex. See Chap. XIV, 13, 27. In all three occurrences of this number K20
has 272, but all other MSS. have 282 (except M6 in this place only).
