### CHAPTER IX.

1\. The greater Hâsar is one part in twelve parts of the day and night,
and the lesser Hâsar is one part in eighteen parts <span
id="fr_1549"></span>[3](#fn_1537.md).

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

2\. The priest (âsrûk) who passes away in idolatry <span
id="fr_1550"></span>[1](#fn_1538) (aû*z*dâyakîh.md) thou hast considered as
desolate (vîrân) <span id="fr_1551"></span>[2](#fn_1539.md); and there is a
high-priest (dastôbar) who is of a different opinion, there is *one* who
says *he is as* a non-Iranian (anâîrân) country <span
id="fr_1552"></span>[3](#fn_1540.md). 3. It is declared that, when a
supreme high-priest (zaratû*s*trotûm) passes away in idolatry, an
apostate (aharmôk) will be born in that dwelling, and a rumour of this
calamity is uttered <span id="fr_1553"></span>[4](#fn_1541.md) by that
supreme high-priest.

4\. In order to be steadfast in the good religion it is to be discussed
with priests *and* high-priests, and when *one* does not discuss it is
proper that he do not teach it.

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

5\. The ceremonial worship (ya*z*i*s*n) which they perform in a
fire-temple <span id="fr_1554"></span>[1](#fn_1542.md), when not *done*
aright, does not reach unto the demons; *but* that which they perform
*in* other places, when they do not perform *it* aright, does reach unto
the demons; for there is no medium in worship, it reaches either unto
the angels or unto the demons. 6. Of a man who has relinquished a *bad*
habit, and through his good capabilities *engages* in renunciation *of
sin* <span id="fr_1555"></span>[2](#fn_1543.md), the good work advances
unto the future existence.

7\. Any one who shall die in a vessel (ka*s*tîk) it is allowable, for
fear of contamination (pa*d*vîshak), to throw into the water; some say
that the water itself is the receptacle for the dead (khazânîh).

8\. This, too, *is declared*: 'When in the dark it is not allowable to
eat food; for the demons and fiends seize upon one-third of the wisdom
and glory of him who eats food in the dark;' and it is declared by that
passage (*g*înâk) which Aûharmazd spoke to Zaratû*s*t, thus: 'After the
departure of the light let him not devour, with unwashed hands, the
water and vegetables of Horvada*d* and Amerôda*d* <span
id="fr_1556"></span>[3](#fn_1544.md); for if after the departure of the
light thou devourest, with unwashed hands, the water and vegetables of
Horvada*d* and Amerôda*d*, the fiend seizes away from thee two-thirds of
the existing original wisdom

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

which, when he seizes *it* away, is the glory and religion which are
auspicious. for thee that day, so that diligence becomes a vexation this
day <span id="fr_1557"></span>[1](#fn_1545.md).'

9\. In a passage of the fifth fargar*d* of the Pâ*z*ôn *Nask* <span
id="fr_1558"></span>[2](#fn_1546.md) it is declared that one mentions these
characteristics

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

of four kinds of worship of the celestial beings (yazdân):—one is that
whose Avesta is correct, *but* the man is bad; the second is that whose
Avesta is faulty (zîfânŏ) <span id="fr_1559"></span>[1](#fn_1547.md), *but*
the man is good; the third is that whose Avesta is correct, *and* the
man is good; *and* the fourth is that whose Avesta is faulty *and* the
man is bad. 10. *That* whose Avesta is correct, *but* the man bad, the
archangels will approach and will listen to, *but* do not accept; *that*
whose Avesta is faulty, *but* the man good, the archangels *and*
angels <span id="fr_1560"></span>[2](#fn_1548.md) will approach, *but* do
not listen to, *and* will accept; *that* whose Avesta is correct, *and*
the man good, the archangels *and* angels will approach, will come to,
will listen to, and will accept; *that* whose Avesta is faulty, *and*
the man bad, they do not approach, do not listen to, and do not accept.

11\. In every ceremonial (ya*z*i*s*nŏ), at the beginning of the
ceremony <span id="fr_1561"></span>[3](#fn_1549.md), and the beginning of
the sacred-cake *consecration* (drôn) <span
id="fr_1562"></span>[4](#fn_1550.md), the angels *and* guardian spirits of
the righteous are to be invited to the ceremony. 12. When they invoke
the angels they will accept the ceremony, and when they do

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

not invoke them, all the guardian spirits of the righteous are to be
invoked at the beginning of 'staomi <span
id="fr_1563"></span>[1](#fn_1551.md);' and when not, they watch until *the
words* 'frashô-*k*arethrãm saoshya*n*tãm <span
id="fr_1564"></span>[2](#fn_1552.md),' and when they shall invoke them
there they will accept the ceremony; and when not, they will watch until
*the words* 'vîsp*a*u fravashayô ashaonãm yazamaidê <span
id="fr_1565"></span>[3](#fn_1553.md),' *and* when they shall invoke *them*
there they will accept <span id="fr_1566"></span>[4](#fn_1554.md) the
ceremony; and when not, *they will watch* until *the words* 't*a*us*k*â
yazamaidê <span id="fr_1567"></span>[5](#fn_1555.md);' and when they invoke
them <span id="fr_1568"></span>[6](#fn_1556.md) *at* the threefold 'ashem
vohû' and *the word* 'dâmanãm <span id="fr_1569"></span>[7](#fn_1557.md),'
at the twice-*told* 'aokhtô-nâmanô <span
id="fr_1570"></span>[8](#fn_1558.md),' the 'ashâd ha*k*â <span
id="fr_1571"></span>[9](#fn_1559.md)', *or* the 'yâtumanahê *g*asaiti <span
id="fr_1572"></span>[10](#fn_1560.md),'

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

they will accept <span id="fr_1573"></span>[1](#fn_1561.md); and when not,
they go up the height of a spear (nî*z*ak) and will remain. 13. And they
speak thus: 'This man does not understand that it will be necessary even
for him <span id="fr_1574"></span>[2](#fn_1562.md) to go from the world,
and our prayer (apistân) is for reminding men; it is not *that* our
uneasiness *arises* from this, that we are in want of their ceremony,
but our uneasiness *arises* from this, that when, they do not reverence
and do not invoke us, when evil comes upon them it is not possible for
us to keep *it* away.'

14\. ''O creator! how much is the duration in life of him who is dead?'
And Aûharmazd spoke thus:, As much as the wing of a fly, O Zaratû*s*t
the Spîtâmân! or as much as the hearing a wing unto a sightless
*one* <span id="fr_1575"></span>[3](#fn_1563.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1537"></span>[308:3](sbe0569.htm#fr_1549.md) The Hâsar is not
only a measure of distance (see Bund. XXVI, 1), but also a measure of
time (see Bund. XXV, 5). According to the text here the greater Hâsar
must be two hours, and the lesser Hâsar (which is not mentioned in M6)
must be one hour and twenty minutes. But Farh. Okh. (P. 43) says,
'dvada-sang-hâthrem asti aghrem ayare, "of twelve Hâsars is the <span
id="page_309">p. 309</span> longest day;" the day and night in which is
the longest day are twelve of the greatest Hâsars, eighteen of the
medium, and twenty-four of the least;' according to which statement
there are three kinds of Hâsar, that are respectively equivalent to two
hours, one hour and twenty minutes, and one hour. As the longest day is
said (Bund. XXV, 4) to be twice the length of the shortest day, and the
greatest Hâsar is twice the length of the least one, it may be
conjectured that the Hâsar varied with the length of the day, being a
subdivision (one-eighth) of the time the sun was above, the horizon;
this would account for the greatest and least Hâsars, which are
one-eighth of the longest and shortest days, respectively; but it does
not account for the medium Hâsar, which is not a mean between the two
extremes, but one-ninth (instead of one-eighth) of the mean day of
twelve hours. If the Hâsar of distance were really a Parasang, as is
sometimes stated, the connection between it and the Hâsar of time would
be obvious, as the average Hâsar of one hour and twenty minutes is just
the time requisite for walking a Parasang, which seems indeed to be
stated in Farh. Okh. p. 42.

<span id="fn_1538"></span>[309:1](sbe0569.htm#fr_1550.md) Or it may be
'passes over into idolatry.'

<span id="fn_1539"></span>[309:2](sbe0569.htm#fr_1551.md) K20 has girân,
'grievous.'

<span id="fn_1540"></span>[309:3](sbe0569.htm#fr_1552.md) That is, he reads
anâîrân instead of vîrân in the foregoing statement.

<span id="fn_1541"></span>[309:4](sbe0569.htm#fr_1553.md) Or, perhaps,
'this calamity is at once announced.'

<span id="fn_1542"></span>[310:1](sbe0569.htm#fr_1554.md) Literally, 'in
the dwelling of fires.' The fire must always be sheltered from the sun's
rays, and in a fire-temple it is kept in a vaulted cell, with a door and
one or two windows opening into the larger closed chamber which
surrounds it.

<span id="fn_1543"></span>[310:2](sbe0569.htm#fr_1555.md) K20 has, 'and it
shall happen through his good capabilities.'

<span id="fn_1544"></span>[310:3](sbe0569.htm#fr_1556.md) The two
archangels whose chief duties are the protection of water and plants,
respectively (see Chap. XV, 5, 25-29, Bund. IX, 2).

<span id="fn_1545"></span>[311:1](sbe0569.htm#fr_1557.md) This passage does
not appear to be now extant in the Avesta.

<span id="fn_1546"></span>[311:2](sbe0569.htm#fr_1558.md) This was the
sixth nask or 'book' of the complete Mazdayasnian literature, according
to the Dînka*r*d, which calls it Pâ*z*î or Pâ*z*ag; but according to the
Dînî-va*g*arkar*d* and the Rivâyats it was the seventh nask, called
Pâ*g*am. For its contents, as given by the Dînî-va*g*arkar*d*, see
Haug's Essays, pp. 128, 129. The following is a short summary of the
account of it given in the eighth book of the Dînkar*d* (that published
in the Pahl.-Pâz. Glossary, pp. 18 4, 185, being taken from the
fifteenth nask, whose contents were mixed up with those of the seventh
through the abstraction of several folios from the Iranian MS. of the
Dînka*r*d before M13, or any other copy, was written in India):—

The Pâ*z*î (or Pâ*z*ag) is about the lawful slaughtering of animals in
the ceremonial rites of fire and water at the season-festivals; also
where, when, and how the festivals are to be celebrated, their
advantages, and the duties of the officiating priests. The rotation of
days, months, and years, summer and winter, the ten days at the end of
the winter, when the guardian spirits visit the world, and the
ceremonies to be then performed. The time for gathering medicinal
plants. The retribution necessary for the various sins affecting the
soul, the advantage of providing for such retribution, and the harm from
not providing it. The thirty-three principal chiefs of the spiritual and
worldly existences. The miracles of great good works, and the heinous
sinfulness of apostasy. How far a wife can give away her husband's
property, and when it is lawful for him to recover it. Whither winter
flees when summer comes on, and where summer goes when winter comes on.
The amount of disaster (vôighn) in one century, and the duration of
everything connected with such disaster. The summer and winter months,
the names of the twelve months, their meaning, and the angels they are
devoted to; also the thirty days of the month, and the five Gâtha days
at the end of the year, when the guardian spirits are to be reverenced.

The fifth fargar*d*, quoted in the text, was probably that portion of
the Nask which described the duties of the officiating priests.

<span id="fn_1547"></span>[312:1](sbe0569.htm#fr_1559.md) K20 has hûzvân,
'tongue, speech,' for zîfân, 'faulty' (compare Pers. zîf, 'sin'), in all
occurrences of the word.

<span id="fn_1548"></span>[312:2](sbe0569.htm#fr_1560.md) K20 omits from
this word to 'will approach' in the next clause of the sentence.

<span id="fn_1549"></span>[312:3](sbe0569.htm#fr_1561.md) That is, shortly
before beginning the regular recitation of the Yasna, the angels, in
whose honour the ceremony is being performed, are invited to approach by
reciting their proper Khshnûmans, or propitiatory formulas (see Chap.
VII, 8, and Haug's Essays, p. 404).

<span id="fn_1550"></span>[312:4](sbe0569.htm#fr_1562.md) This begins with
Yas. III, 1, and the spirits are to be invited by adding their proper
Khshnûmans to those contained in Yas. III, 3-20 (see Haug's Essays, p.
408).

<span id="fn_1551"></span>[313:1](sbe0569.htm#fr_1563.md) This may be at
the 'staomi' of Yas. XII, 6, which is recited before the Yasna is
commenced; but K20 alters the meaning (by inserting the relative
particle) into '*they* are to be invoked at "staomi," the beginning of
"all the guardian spirits of the righteous" (Yas. XXVI, 1).'

<span id="fn_1552"></span>[313:2](sbe0569.htm#fr_1564.md) Yas. XXVI, 20.

<span id="fn_1553"></span>[313:3](sbe0569.htm#fr_1565.md) Yas. XXVI, 34.

<span id="fn_1554"></span>[313:4](sbe0569.htm#fr_1566.md) K20 has, 'shall
not invoke,' and 'will not accept.'

<span id="fn_1555"></span>[313:5](sbe0569.htm#fr_1567.md) The concluding
words of the yêNhê hâtãm formula, probably of that one at the end of
Yas. XXVII, just preceding the recital of the Gâthas, up to which time
the spirits wait, but, if not invoked, they are then supposed to ascend,
away from the ceremony, as mentioned in the text.

<span id="fn_1556"></span>[313:6](sbe0569.htm#fr_1568.md) K20 has, 'when
they do not invoke them.'

<span id="fn_1557"></span>[313:7](sbe0569.htm#fr_1569.md) Yas. VIII, 10;
which is preceded by a thrice-told 'ashem vohû,' at which the
officiating priest tastes the sacred cake, being the end of the Drôn
ceremony (see Haug's Essays, pp. 404, 408).

<span id="fn_1558"></span>[313:8](sbe0569.htm#fr_1570.md) Yas. XXII, 33 (§§
14-33 being recited twice). At this point the officiating priest brings
out the mortar for pounding the Hôm twigs (see Haug's Essays, p. 405);
Yas. XXII being called the beginning of the Hômâst in the Vi*s*tâsp
Ya*s*t Sâdah.

<span id="fn_1559"></span>[313:9](sbe0569.htm#fr_1571.md) Yas. XXIV, 30,
when the officiating priest turns the mortar right side upwards.

<span id="fn_1560"></span>[313:10](sbe0569.htm#fr_1572.md) Yas. VIII, 9,
which is practically the same place as the threefold 'ashem vohû' before
mentioned.

<span id="fn_1561"></span>[314:1](sbe0569.htm#fr_1573.md) K20 has, 'they
will not accept.'

<span id="fn_1562"></span>[314:2](sbe0569.htm#fr_1574.md) Literally, 'for
me,' which seems to refer to the man, and not to the spirits.

<span id="fn_1563"></span>[314:3](sbe0569.htm#fr_1575.md) This appears to
be the complete translation of the Avesta sentence partially quoted in
Pahl. Vend. VIII, 64: 'yatha makhshy*a*u perenem, yatha vâ perenahê,'
&c. The last clause is doubtful; the reading adopted here is *k*and
zak-i shinavâk-*i* par andarg avênâk, as nothing more satisfactory
suggests itself; it might also be translated by 'as much as the sound of
a wing in the invisible.'
