### CHAPTER VIII.

1\. As he (Aharman) came fourthly to the plants—which have struggled
(kûkhshî-aîtŏ) against him with the whole vegetation—because the
vegetation *was* quite dry <span id="fr_991"></span>[1](#fn_985),
Amerôda*d*, by whom the essence of the world's vegetation <span
id="fr_992"></span>[2](#fn_986) was seized upon, pounded it up small,
and mixed *it* up with the rain-water of Tî*s*tar. 2. After the rain the
whole earth is discerned sprouting, and ten thousand <span
id="fr_993"></span>[3](#fn_987) special species and a hundred
thousand <span id="fr_994"></span>[4](#fn_988) additional species
(levatman sar*d*akŏ) so grew as if *there were* a species of every kind;
and those ten thousand species are provided for <span
id="fr_995"></span>[5](#fn_989) keeping away the ten thousand <span
id="fr_996"></span>[3](#fn_987) diseases.

3\. Afterwards, the seed was taken up from those hundred thousand
species of plants, *and* from the collection of seed the tree of all
germs, amid the wide-formed ocean, was produced, from which all species
of plants continually grow. 4. And the griffon bird (sênô mûrûvŏ) has
his resting-place upon it; when he wanders forth *from* within it, he
scatters the dry seed into the water, *and* it is rained back to the
earth with the rain.

5\. And in its vicinity the tree was produced *which is* the white Hôm,
the counteractor of decrepitude,

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

the reviver of the dead, *and* the immortalizer of the living.

6\. This was the fourth contest, about the plants.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_985"></span>[176:1](sbe0552.htm#fr_991) This chapter is a
paraphrase of Bund. IX.

<span id="fn_986"></span>[176:2](sbe0552.htm#fr_992) Or, perhaps, 'the
worldly characteristics of vegetation.'

<span id="fn_987"></span>[176:3](sbe0552.htm#fr_996) Written like 'one
thousand,' but see the context and Bund. IX, 4.

<span id="fn_988"></span>[176:4](sbe0552.htm#fr_994) In Bund. IX, 4, the
MSS. have '120,000,' which is probably wrong, as Bund. XXVII, 2, agrees
with the text above.

<span id="fn_989"></span>[176:5](sbe0552.htm#fr_995) The MS. has barâ
instead of pavan, a blunder due probably to some copyist reading the
Huzvâri*s* in Persian, in which language bih (= barâ) and bah (= pavan)
are written alike. In Pâzand they are usually written b*e* and pa,
respectively.
