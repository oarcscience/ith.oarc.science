### CHAPTER XII.

1\. The rule is this, that when one's *form of* worship (ya*s*t) <span
id="fr_1679"></span>[4](#fn_1667.md) is performed, and it is not possible
for him to prepare *it*, the practice of those of the primitive
faith <span id="fr_1680"></span>[5](#fn_1668.md) is, when the girdle
(aîpiyâûng) is twined about a *sacred* twig-bundle (baresôm) <span
id="fr_1681"></span>[6](#fn_1669) of seven twigs (tâk.md), to consecrate a
sacred cake (drônô) thrice, which becomes his *form of* worship that is
performed one degree better through the sacred cake; and of the merit of
a threefold *consecration*

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

*of the* sacred cake the high-priests *have* specially taught, in the
Hûspâram *Nask* <span id="fr_1682"></span>[1](#fn_1670.md), that *it* is as
much as *that* of a lesser *form of* worship.

2\. The rule is this, that he who is himself more acquainted with
religion is he who considers him who is more acquainted with religion
than himself as high-priest, and considers *him* as high-priest <span
id="fr_1683"></span>[2](#fn_1671.md) so that he may not destroy the bridge
of the soul <span id="fr_1684"></span>[3](#fn_1672.md); as it says in the
Sakâ*d*ûm *Nask* <span id="fr_1685"></span>[4](#fn_1673.md) that no one of
them, that is an inattentive (asrûshdâr) man who has no high-priest,
attains to the best existence <span id="fr_1686"></span>[5](#fn_1674.md),
not though his recitations should be so many that they have made his
duty and good works as much as the verdure (sapdak) of the plants when
it shoots forth in spring, the verdure which Aûharmazd *has* given
abundantly.

3\. The rule is this, that they keep a fire <span
id="fr_1687"></span>[6](#fn_1675.md) in the house, because, from not
keeping the fire properly, *there* arise less pregnancy of women and a
weeping (â*v*-dî*d*anŏ) for the loss of strength (tanû) of men <span
id="fr_1688"></span>[7](#fn_1676); and the chilled charcoal (angi*s*t.md)
and the rest which are without advantage (bar) are to be

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

carried away from the fire; and in the Spend *Nask* <span
id="fr_1689"></span>[1](#fn_1677.md) *it* is revealed that a fire, when
they shall make it quite clean from its chilled charcoal, *has* as much
comfort as a man whose clothing they should make clean.

4\. The rule is this, that when any one passes away it is proper to
render useless <span id="fr_1690"></span>[2](#fn_1678.md) as much as the
smallest mouth-veil <span id="fr_1691"></span>[3](#fn_1679.md), for it
says, in the Vendidad <span id="fr_1692"></span>[4](#fn_1680.md) that 'if
even those Mazdayasnians should leave on him who is dead, in parting
with him, as much as that which a damsel would leave in parting with the
*food*-bowl (pa*d*mânakŏ)—that is, a bag (anbânakŏ-hanâ) <span
id="fr_1693"></span>[5](#fn_1681.md)'—the decree is this, that *it* is a
Tanâpûhar

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

*sin* <span id="fr_1694"></span>[1](#fn_1682.md) at root, which is hell;
*and* in the Vendidad <span id="fr_1695"></span>[2](#fn_1683.md) it says
that the clothing of the charitable (dahi*s*n-hômand) soul, and even the
clothing which they will give *it*, are out of almsgivings
(dâsarân) <span id="fr_1696"></span>[3](#fn_1684.md).

5\. The rule is this, that when any one passes away after keeping
fasting the three *nights* <span id="fr_1697"></span>[4](#fn_1685.md),
still the presentation of holy-water (zôhar) to the fire is to be
performed, which is the presenting of the holy-water to the nearest
fire; for in the Dâmdâ*d* *Nask* <span id="fr_1698"></span>[5](#fn_1686.md)
*it* is revealed that when they sever (tebrûnd) the consciousness of men
it goes out to the nearest fire, then out to the stars, then out to the

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

moon, and then out to the sun <span id="fr_1699"></span>[1](#fn_1687.md);
and *it* is needful that the nearest fire, which is that to which it
*has* come out, should become stronger (zôr-hômand-tar) <span
id="fr_1700"></span>[2](#fn_1688.md).

6\. The rule is this, that they should not leave a nail-*paring*
unprayed over (anâfsû*d*ak), for if it be not prayed over (afsând) <span
id="fr_1701"></span>[3](#fn_1689.md) it turns into the arms *and*
equipments of the Mâzanân demons <span
id="fr_1702"></span>[4](#fn_1690.md); *this* is explicitly shown in the
Vendidad <span id="fr_1703"></span>[5](#fn_1691.md).

7\. The rule is this, that the labour of child-birth <span
id="fr_1704"></span>[6](#fn_1692.md) is not to be accomplished at night,
except while with the light of a fire, or the stars and moon, upon *it*;
for great opposition is connected with it, and in the twentieth of the
Hûspâram *Nask* <span id="fr_1705"></span>[7](#fn_1693.md) it is shown
*that* over the soul of him who works in the dark *there is* more
predominance of the evil spirit.

8\. The rule is this, that they should allow the egg and other
food <span id="fr_1706"></span>[8](#fn_1694.md) for those gifts *and*
favours of the

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

sovereign moon (mâh-i khû*d*âî) and the other angels; if so, it is to be
allowed by them thus: 'I will consecrate so much food for such an
angel,' and not thus: 'One sacred cake (drônô) in so much food.' 9. And
the reason of it is this, that *they* who shall allow thus: 'One sacred
cake out of so much food,' and of which *it* is one thing less, even
though *one* shall consecrate *it* many times, still then he *has* not
repaid; and *they* who should allow thus: 'I will consecrate so much
food for such an angel,' though *one* shall reverence *him* with many
sacred cakes, it is proper. 10. And in the twenty-two *sections* of the
Sakâ*d*ûm *Nask* <span id="fr_1707"></span>[1](#fn_1695.md) grievous things
are shown about those who do not make offerings (aûstôfrî*d*) unto the
angels.

11\. The rule is this, that when a woman becomes pregnant, as long as it
is possible, a fire *one* cares for well is to be maintained in the
house, because it is revealed <span id="fr_1708"></span>[2](#fn_1696.md) in
the Spend Nask that *to* Dûkdâv <span id="fr_1709"></span>[3](#fn_1697.md),
the mother of Zaratû*s*t, when she was pregnant with Zaratû*s*t, for
three nights, every night a leader (shâh) <span
id="fr_1710"></span>[4](#fn_1698.md) with a hundred and fifty demons came
for the destruction of Zaratû*s*t, and yet, owing to the existence of
the fire in the dwelling, they knew no means *for it*.

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

12\. The rule is this, where a child is born, *during* three days, for
protection from demons, wizards, and witches, a fire is to be made at
night until day*light*, and is to be maintained there in the day, and
pure incense is to be put upon it, as is revealed in the thirtieth of
the Sakâ*d*ûm *Nask* <span id="fr_1711"></span>[1](#fn_1699.md).

13\. The rule is this <span id="fr_1712"></span>[2](#fn_1700.md), that from
a toothpick the bark <span id="fr_1713"></span>[3](#fn_1701.md) is to be
well cut off, for there are *some* of those of the primitive faith <span
id="fr_1714"></span>[4](#fn_1702.md) who *have* said that, when <span
id="fr_1715"></span>[5](#fn_1703.md) they shall make it for the teeth
*with* the bark on, and they throw *it* away, a pregnant woman, who puts
a foot upon it, is doubtful about *its* being dead matter.

14\. The rule is this, that *it* is well *if any one of* those who have
their handmaid (*k*akar) in cohabitation (zanîh), and offspring is born
of her, shall accept all those who are male as sons; *but* those who are
female are no advantage, because an adopted *son* (satôr) is requisite,
and in the fourteenth of the Hûspâram *Nask* <span
id="fr_1716"></span>[6](#fn_1704.md) the high-priests

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

*have* taught thus: 'My son is suitable also as thy son, *but* my
daughter is not suitable also as thy daughter;' and *there* are many
who <span id="fr_1717"></span>[1](#fn_1705.md) do not appoint an adopted
*son with* this idea, that: 'The child of a handmaid may be accepted by
us as a son.'

15\. The rule is this, that *one is* to persevere much in the begetting
of offspring, since *it is* for the acquisition <span
id="fr_1718"></span>[2](#fn_1706.md) of many good works at once; because in
the Spend <span id="fr_1719"></span>[3](#fn_1707.md) and Nihâ*d*ûm
Nasks <span id="fr_1720"></span>[4](#fn_1708.md) the high-priests *have*
taught that the duty and good works which a son performs are as much the
father's as though they had been done by his own hand; and in the
Dâmdâ*d* *Nask* <span id="fr_1721"></span>[5](#fn_1709.md), it is revealed
thus: 'Likewise, too, the good works, *in* like manner, which come *to*
the father as his own.'

18\. The rule is this, that what they shall give to the worthy is as
much as is proper and beyond, for eating *and* accumulating; because in
the Nihâ*d*ûm *Nask* <span id="fr_1722"></span>[6](#fn_1710.md) the
high-priests *have* taught thus: 'When a man gives bread to a man, even
though that man *has* too much bread, all the good works, which he shall
perform through that superabundance, become as much his *who gave it* as
though they had been done by his own hand.'

17\. The rule is this, that in the night water is

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

not to be drawn <span id="fr_1723"></span>[1](#fn_1711.md) from a well, as
in the Bâg-yasnô <span id="fr_1724"></span>[2](#fn_1712.md) notice is given
about the uncleanness (ayo*s*dâsarîh) of well-water at night.

18\. The rule is this, that in the night anything eatable is not to be
cast away to the north, because a fiend *will* become pregnant; and when
it is cast away one Yathâ-ahû-vairyô <span
id="fr_1725"></span>[3](#fn_1713.md) is to be uttered. 19. Those of the
primitive faith <span id="fr_1726"></span>[4](#fn_1714.md) who *used* to
act more orthodoxically (hû-rastakîhâtar), when food *was* eaten by them
in the night, for the sake of preservation from sin owing to the coming
of strainings *and* sprinklings *on* to the ground, directed a man to
chant the Ahunavar <span id="fr_1727"></span>[5](#fn_1715.md) from the
beginning of the feast

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (myazd) unto the
end, more especially at the feast of the season-festivals; as it says in
the Hâ*d*ôkht *Nask* <span id="fr_1728"></span>[1](#fn_1716.md), that of
the sayings which are spoken out the Ahunavar is that *which is* most
triumphant.

20\. The rule is this, that when *one* sees a hedgehog he takes *it*
back to the plain, and its own place is to be preserved free from
danger; for in the Vendidad the high-priests *have* taught, that every
day, when the hedgehog voids urine into an ant's nest, a thousand ants
will die <span id="fr_1729"></span>[2](#fn_1717.md).

21\. The rule is this, that some who are of the good religion *say*,
where *one* is washing *his* face, one Ashem-vohû <span
id="fr_1730"></span>[3](#fn_1718.md) is always to be uttered, *and* that
Ashem-vohû is to be uttered before the *washing*; for when he utters
*it* while washing *his* face, *he* is doubtful (var-hômand) about the
water coming to *his* mouth.

22\. The rule is this, that they select from the purifiers <span
id="fr_1731"></span>[4](#fn_1719)—when their business (mindavam.md) is as
important (rabâ) as purity and impurity—*him* with whom the
control <span id="fr_1732"></span>[5](#fn_1720.md) of ablution
(pâ*d*îyâ*v*îh) <span id="fr_1733"></span>[6](#fn_1721.md), and
non-ablution is connected; they select *him* especially

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

with regard to the good disposition and truthful speaking of the man,
and *to* the particular work; and on account of *his being*, in
innocence *he* is to be considered more righteous. 23. As in the
Vendidad <span id="fr_1734"></span>[1](#fn_1722.md) it says, about the two
shares of righteousness, how *one* should tell that *he is* 'a righteous
man, O Zaratû*s*t the Spîtâmân! who is a purifier, who should be a
speaker that speaks truly, an enquirer of the *sacred* texts—that is, he
has performed his ritual (ya*s*t)—a righteous *one* who specially
understands purification from the religion of the Mazdayasnians, that
is, he understands its *religious* formulas (nîrang).' 24. When *it* is
so that the control of their ablution is connected with him, so that
they consider what *pertains* to the *purifying* bowl (zak-i tâ*s*tîk)
as his, and ever abstain from it, though the angels hear and consider
*them* as clean, and they select for him those who consecrate the water
and bull's urine (gômê*z*) on account of *their* control, of
purification (yô*s*dâsarkarîh), *and it* is to be performed very
observantly by the consecrators at the place which is to be measured
with a measure and very exactly (khûptar) <span
id="fr_1735"></span>[2](#fn_1723.md). 25. And the purifier is so much the
better when washed again, and when *it is* by some one through whose
periodic (zamânîk)

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

care *he* is thus done; for in the periodic interval many secret <span
id="fr_1736"></span>[1](#fn_1724.md) kinds of pollution are produced. 26.
Of the celebrators of the Vendidad the good are *they* who shall again
perform the Navashâ*d*ar rite <span id="fr_1737"></span>[2](#fn_1725.md);
for, on account of the same nicety (nâ*z*ûkîh) which is written above by
me, *and* on account of much also *that is* secret, which has happened
*and* mostly arises about it, *there* is no harm from performing *it*.
27: And *any one* of those who shall receive the water and bull's urine
*it* is very important to wash beforehand (pavan pê*s*) <span
id="fr_1738"></span>[3](#fn_1726.md); because, if *there* be impurity
*about* him <span id="fr_1739"></span>[4](#fn_1727.md), *and* he puts a
hand to the cup (*g*âmak), the water, *and* the bull's urine, *they* are
unclean (apâ*d*â*v*ŏ) <span id="fr_1740"></span>[5](#fn_1728.md); when *it
is* so that *there* be some one, when so, *it* is better *that* they
always wash his eyelids (môyak gâs), and to wash them by the clean is
good.

28\. The rule is this, that thou shouldst not consider even any one
hopeless (anâîmê*d*) of heaven,

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

and they should not set *their* minds steadfastly on hell; thereby much
sinfulness for which *there* is a desire would be undesirable, because
*there* is nothing which is a sin *in* my religion for which *there* is
no retribution, as it says in the Gâthas <span
id="fr_1741"></span>[1](#fn_1729.md) thus:—'Of those who are aware that
thou art, O Aûharmazd! is even he who is infamous (raspakŏ); and they
know the punishment of him even who is very sinful.' 29. And *as to* him
even who is a very sinful person, through the desire <span
id="fr_1742"></span>[2](#fn_1730.md) of good works which is entertained by
him, *there* then comes more fully to him the joy of a soul newly worthy
(nuk shâya*d*); as in the Spend *Nask* <span
id="fr_1743"></span>[3](#fn_1731.md) *it* was shown to Zaratû*s*t about one
man, that all *his* limbs were in torment, and one foot was outside;
*and* Zaratû*s*t enquired of Aûharmazd about the reason *of it; and*
Aûharmazd said that he was a man, Davâns <span
id="fr_1744"></span>[4](#fn_1732.md) by name; he was ruler over
thirty-three <span id="fr_1745"></span>[5](#fn_1733.md) districts, and he
never practised

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

any good work, except one time when fodder *was* conveyed by him to a
sheep with that one foot.

30\. The rule is this, that when a man has performed his *form of*
worship (ya*s*t), and his wife has not performed *it, it* is extremely
necessary to perform the suitable *form of* worship, or to order a
Gêtô-kharî*d* <span id="fr_1746"></span>[1](#fn_1734.md), so that they may
become such as are dwelling more closely *together* in the spiritual
*existence* than in the world; and in the Hâ*d*ôkht *Nask* <span
id="fr_1747"></span>[2](#fn_1735) it says that a woman (nâîrîk.md) who
shall be reverent (tarsak) is to be considered as much as she who is
suitable (zîyâk).

31\. The rule is this, that these five ceremonies (ya*z*i*s*n), when
they shall perform *them*, are good works <span
id="fr_1748"></span>[3](#fn_1736.md); when *one* does not perform *them*,
and the time is manifest to him, and when he shall set *them* aside to
perform *them* out of the proper time, they shall go to the bridge <span
id="fr_1749"></span>[4](#fn_1737.md) *as* sin; the ceremonies which go to
the bridge are these, and in the Hûspâram *Nask* <span
id="fr_1750"></span>[5](#fn_1738.md) it says that *they are* the
non-celebration of the rites (lâ ya*s*tanŏ) of the
season-festivals <span id="fr_1751"></span>[6](#fn_1739.md), the

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rapîtvîn <span
id="fr_1752"></span>[1](#fn_1740.md), the three *nights* <span
id="fr_1753"></span>[2](#fn_1741.md) *after a death*, the *days devoted* to
the guardian spirits <span id="fr_1754"></span>[3](#fn_1742.md), and the
sun and moon <span id="fr_1755"></span>[4](#fn_1743.md).

32\. The rule is this, that at every one of these three things, *which*
come through hungry living, that is, sneezing, yawning, and sighing,
*one* is to speak out a Yathâ-ahû-vairyô and one Ashem-vohû <span
id="fr_1756"></span>[5](#fn_1744.md); and also when *one* hears the
sneezing of any one, to speak *in* like manner is so considered as an
action of the good <span id="fr_1757"></span>[6](#fn_1745.md); *and* in the
Stû*d*gar *Nask* <span id="fr_1758"></span>[7](#fn_1746.md) it says thus:
'"What prepares sneezing? that is, through what process (kâr) does it
come?" And Aûharmazd said thus: "Hungry living, O Zaratû*s*t! because
the remedy for its existence is the Ahunavar, O Zaratû*s*t! *and*
righteousness <span id="fr_1759"></span>[8](#fn_1747.md)."'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1667"></span>[338:4](sbe0572.htm#fr_1679.md) A Ya*s*t is a
formula of praise in honour of the sun, moon, water, fire, or some other
angel, as well as a term for prayers and worship in general.

<span id="fn_1668"></span>[338:5](sbe0572.htm#fr_1680.md) See Chap. I, 3.

<span id="fn_1669"></span>[338:6](sbe0572.htm#fr_1681.md) See Chap. III,
32, note.

<span id="fn_1670"></span>[339:1](sbe0572.htm#fr_1682.md) See Chap. X, 21.
The passage mentioned in the text was probably in the section called
Nîrangistân.

<span id="fn_1671"></span>[339:2](sbe0572.htm#fr_1683.md) K20 omits this
repetition.

<span id="fn_1672"></span>[339:3](sbe0572.htm#fr_1684.md) That is, may not
render the passage of his soul to heaven, over the *K*inva*d* bridge
(see Bund. XII, 7), impossible, owing to the sin of arrogance in this
world.

<span id="fn_1673"></span>[339:4](sbe0572.htm#fr_1685.md) See Chap. X, 25;
the passage alluded to was probably at the beginning of the Nask, which
treated of 'the reward of the precepts of religion, and the bridge of
the destroyers of good preceptors, adapted to their destruction.'

<span id="fn_1674"></span>[339:5](sbe0572.htm#fr_1686.md) See Chap. VI, 3.

<span id="fn_1675"></span>[339:6](sbe0572.htm#fr_1687.md) K20 has 'that a
fire is to be properly kept.'

<span id="fn_1676"></span>[339:7](sbe0572.htm#fr_1688.md) K20 has 'and a
loss of the strength and wealth of men.'

<span id="fn_1677"></span>[340:1](sbe0572.htm#fr_1689.md) See Chap. X, 4;
the passage mentioned was probably in that part of the Nask which
described the protection afforded by the fire to the new-born
Zaratû*s*t.

<span id="fn_1678"></span>[340:2](sbe0572.htm#fr_1690.md) Probably a
negative is omitted, or akârînî*d*anŏ should be translated 'to make no
use of.'

<span id="fn_1679"></span>[340:3](sbe0572.htm#fr_1691.md) See Chap. X, 40.
K20 has 'garment.'

<span id="fn_1680"></span>[340:4](sbe0572.htm#fr_1692.md) Always written
Vadîkdâ*d* in this second part of Sls., except in Chap. XIII, 7; whereas
in the first part it is written in its uncorrupted form
*G*avî*d*-dêf-dâ*d* or *G*avî*d*-*s*êdâ-dâ*d*, 'the law opposed to the
demons.' The passage here quoted is Pahl. Vend. V, 171, 172, with one or
two verbal variations.

<span id="fn_1681"></span>[340:5](sbe0572.htm#fr_1693.md) Standing for
anbânak-aê, which is corrupted in the Vendidad MSS. into the
unintelligible form andanakŏ-1, so that this old quotation throws a
rather unexpected light upon a passage in the Vendidad which translators
would be almost certain to misunderstand. The allusion is to the bags
used by a menstruous woman, when eating, to prevent contamination of the
food. The Persian Rivâyats state that three bags (kîsah) are made of two
thicknesses of strong linen, one bag to wear on each hand, and the
third, which is larger, to hold the metal food-bowl and water-goblet.
After thoroughly washing her hands and face, she puts the two bags on
her hands, taking care that they do not touch her food, or clothes, or
any other part of her body. She then feeds herself with a metal spoon,
which must not touch her nose; and when the meal <span id="page_341">p.
341</span> is finished the food-bowl and water-goblet are placed on the
large bag, and the two smaller bags inside it, till wanted again.

<span id="fn_1682"></span>[341:1](sbe0572.htm#fr_1694.md) See Chap. I, 1,
2.

<span id="fn_1683"></span>[341:2](sbe0572.htm#fr_1695.md) This passage does
not appear to be now extant in the Vendidad, and it is possible to read
Nask Dâ*d* instead of Vadîkdâ*d*. The Dâ*d*î or Dâ*d*ak Nask was the
eleventh nask or 'book' of the complete Mazdayasnian literature,
according to the Dînkar*d*, which merely says that its 'Avesta and Zand
are not communicated to us by the high-priest.' According to the
Dînî-va*g*arkar*d*, which calls it Khûstô and the Rivâyats, which call
it Kha*s*t, it was the twelfth Nask, and they give its contents in more
detail than usual (see Haug's Essays, pp. 130, 131).

<span id="fn_1684"></span>[341:3](sbe0572.htm#fr_1696.md) Meaning that the
dead require no clothing, as their future bodies will be clothed out of
the garments they have given away in charity. The resemblance of this
statement to that contained in Bund. XXX, 28, which must have been
abridged from the Dâmdâd Nask (see SZS. IX, 1), renders it possible that
it may have been taken from that Nask.

<span id="fn_1685"></span>[341:4](sbe0572.htm#fr_1697.md) No fresh meat is
to be cooked or eaten for the first three days after a death in the
house, according to the Sad-dar Bundahi*s*, LXXVIII (compare Chap. XVII,
1-3).

<span id="fn_1686"></span>[341:5](sbe0572.htm#fr_1698.md) See SZS. IX, 1.
The passage here quoted may perhaps be found in the complete text of the
Bundahi*s*, as given in TD (Chap. 37; see Introduction, [p.
xxxvii](sbe0504.htm#page_xxxvii).md).

<span id="fn_1687"></span>[342:1](sbe0572.htm#fr_1699.md) A righteous soul
is supposed to step out first to the star station, then to the moon
station, and then to the sun station, on its way to Garô*d*mân, the
highest heaven; but if its righteousness is imperfect it has to stop at
one of these three stations, which are the three lower grades of heaven
(see note on pâhlûm ahvân, Chap. VI, 3).

<span id="fn_1688"></span>[342:2](sbe0572.htm#fr_1700.md) Or 'more provided
with zôr,' which may mean 'holy-water,' as the two words zôr and zôhar
are occasionally confounded.

<span id="fn_1689"></span>[342:3](sbe0572.htm#fr_1701.md) Or, perhaps, 'if
they shall not pray over *it*.'

<span id="fn_1690"></span>[342:4](sbe0572.htm#fr_1702.md) See Bund. III,
20, XIX, 19, 20.

<span id="fn_1691"></span>[342:5](sbe0572.htm#fr_1703.md) Vend. XVII, 29.

<span id="fn_1692"></span>[342:6](sbe0572.htm#fr_1704.md)
Barman-zerkhûni*s*nîh may also mean 'begetting a son.'

<span id="fn_1693"></span>[342:7](sbe0572.htm#fr_1705.md) See Chap. X, 21.
The word 'twentieth' appears to refer to the second group of twenty
sections, one of which treated of the begetting, birth, and treatment of
children.

<span id="fn_1694"></span>[342:8](sbe0572.htm#fr_1706.md) Referring to the
egg, drôns, frasasts, and gâu*s* hudh*a*u or 'meat-offering' (which may
be either butter or meat, see Chap. XI, 4) that are used in the drôn
ceremony, or consecration of the sacred cakes (see note on drôn, Chap.
III, 32). The object of <span id="page_343">p. 343</span> this paragraph
is, evidently to reprove niggardliness in such offerings, and to prevent
their being mere pretexts for feasting.

<span id="fn_1695"></span>[343:1](sbe0572.htm#fr_1707.md) See Chap. X, 25.,
The passage alluded to here was probably in that section, of the last
twenty-two, which treated of the spirits of the earthly existences, one
portion of which was 'about preparing offerings (aûstôfrîtô) to the
angels.'

<span id="fn_1696"></span>[343:2](sbe0572.htm#fr_1708.md) M6 has 'the fire
of Aûharmazd is to be fully maintained, *and* it is revealed,' &c. This
section is a repetition of Chap. X, 4, with a few variations.

<span id="fn_1697"></span>[343:3](sbe0572.htm#fr_1709.md) Here written
Dû*d*kâv.

<span id="fn_1698"></span>[343:4](sbe0572.htm#fr_1710.md) Or it may be read
*s*êdâ, 'a demon', meaning, an 'arch-fiend.'

<span id="fn_1699"></span>[344:1](sbe0572.htm#fr_1711.md) That is, in the
first thirty sections of the Nask (see Chap. X, 25); the passage alluded
to must have been, in that portion which treated of new-born infants and
their proper treatment.

<span id="fn_1700"></span>[344:2](sbe0572.htm#fr_1712.md) §§ 13-16 are a
repetition of Chap. X, 20-23, with a few variations.

<span id="fn_1701"></span>[344:3](sbe0572.htm#fr_1713.md) The word appears
to be tôpŏ or tûfŏ, which would rather mean 'scum' or 'gum' (see Bund.
XXVII, 19), unless it be considered a miswriting of tô*g*ŏ or tô*z*ŏ,
which would mean 'thin bark' or 'bast.' It can also be read tûpar, 'a
leather bag,' and the sentence can be so translated as to imply that a
toothpick should be cut out of a leather bag, an alternative similar to
that suggested by the text of Chap. X, 20.

<span id="fn_1702"></span>[344:4](sbe0572.htm#fr_1714.md) See Chap. I, 3.

<span id="fn_1703"></span>[344:5](sbe0572.htm#fr_1715.md) Reading amat,
'when,' instead of mûn, 'who' (see Bund. I, 7, note).

<span id="fn_1704"></span>[344:6](sbe0572.htm#fr_1716.md) See Chap. X, 21.

<span id="fn_1705"></span>[345:1](sbe0572.htm#fr_1717.md) The writer of M6
evidently found his original illegible at this place, as he wrote . . .
maman instead of mûn denman.

<span id="fn_1706"></span>[345:2](sbe0572.htm#fr_1718.md) M6 has
'performance,' which is probably a misreading, due to the original of
that MS. being partially illegible.

<span id="fn_1707"></span>[345:3](sbe0572.htm#fr_1719.md) See Chap. X, 4.
This Nask is not mentioned in Chap. X, 22, and the passage here alluded
to is not to be traced in any of the short accounts of its contents.

<span id="fn_1708"></span>[345:4](sbe0572.htm#fr_1720.md) See Chap. X, 3,
22.

<span id="fn_1709"></span>[345:5](sbe0572.htm#fr_1721.md) See SZS. IX, 1,
and Chap. X, 22.

<span id="fn_1710"></span>[345:6](sbe0572.htm#fr_1722.md) See Chap. X, 3,
23.

<span id="fn_1711"></span>[346:1](sbe0572.htm#fr_1723.md) K20 has 'that
water is not to be drawn on foot.'

<span id="fn_1712"></span>[346:2](sbe0572.htm#fr_1724.md) Probably the
Bakân-yastô is meant, which was the fourteenth nask or 'book' of the
complete Mazdayasnian literature, according to the Dînkar*d*; but
according to the Dînî-va*g*arkar*d* and the Rivâyats it was the
fifteenth nask, called Baghân-ya*s*t. For its contents, as given by the
Dînî-va*g*arkar*d*, see Haug's Essays, p. 132. The following is the
account of it given in the eighth book of the Dînka*r*d:—

'The Bakân-yastô is a treatise, first, on the worship (yastô) of
Aûharmazd, the most pre-eminent of divinities (bakân a*v*artûm), and,
secondly, the worship of the angels of the other invisible and visible
worldly existences, out of whom are even the names of the days, and the
glory, power, triumph, and miraculousness of their life also is extreme;
the angels who are invoked by name in their worship, and the attention
*and* salutation *due* to them; the worthiness *and* dispensation of
favour for worshippers, *and* the business of their many separate
recitations unto the angels; the business of unlimited acquaintance with
knowledge about the promoters of the treasures of the period, unto whom
the creator Aûharmazd *is* to intrust them, *and* they remain to cause
industry. Perfect is the excellence of righteousness.'

<span id="fn_1713"></span>[346:3](sbe0572.htm#fr_1725.md) See Bund. I, 21.
This section is a repetition of Chap. X, 7, with a few variations.

<span id="fn_1714"></span>[346:4](sbe0572.htm#fr_1726.md) See Chap. I, 3.

<span id="fn_1715"></span>[346:5](sbe0572.htm#fr_1727.md) That is, the
Yathâ-ahû-vairyô (see Bund. I, 21).

<span id="fn_1716"></span>[347:1](sbe0572.htm#fr_1728.md) See B. Yt. III,
25. The passage here quoted must have been in the first division of the
Nask.

<span id="fn_1717"></span>[347:2](sbe0572.htm#fr_1729.md) This section is a
repetition of Chap. X, 31.

<span id="fn_1718"></span>[347:3](sbe0572.htm#fr_1730.md) See Bund. XX, 2.

<span id="fn_1719"></span>[347:4](sbe0572.htm#fr_1731.md) The yô*s*dâsarân,
'purifiers' (Av. yao*z*dâthrya), are those priests who retain so much of
the purifying effect of the Bareshnûm ceremony (see Chap. II, 6) as to
be able to assist in purifying others by means of the same ceremony.
When that effect has passed away a priest can no longer perform the
sacred rites, until he has again undergone the nine nights’ purification
of the Bareshnûm.

<span id="fn_1720"></span>[347:5](sbe0572.htm#fr_1732.md) Reading band, but
it may he bôd, 'vitality, essence.'

<span id="fn_1721"></span>[347:6](sbe0572.htm#fr_1733.md) See Chap. II, 52.

<span id="fn_1722"></span>[348:1](sbe0572.htm#fr_1734.md) The passage here
quoted is from Pahl. Vend. IX, 4-6.

<span id="fn_1723"></span>[348:2](sbe0572.htm#fr_1735.md) Referring to the
Bareshnûm-gah, or place prepared for the Bareshnûm ceremony of
purification with bull's urine and water, which are handed to the person
undergoing purification by an officiating priest (see Chap. II, 6). The
place is marked out with furrows in the ground, and furnished with
stones (magh) to squat upon during the ablutions (see B. Yt. II. 36).
The construction of this paragraph is very obscure in many places, and
its proper division into sentences is, therefore, uncertain.

<span id="fn_1724"></span>[349:1](sbe0572.htm#fr_1736.md) Reading nihân,
but we might perhaps read 'causes (vahân) of pollution of many kinds.'
The meaning of the section is, that it is necessary for the purifying
priest to maintain his own purity by frequently undergoing the Bareshnûm
ceremony himself.

<span id="fn_1725"></span>[349:2](sbe0572.htm#fr_1737.md) Ya*s*t-i
Navashâ*d*ar in all MSS., but the latter word is most probably a
corruption of Av. navakhshapara, 'a period of nine nights,' for which
length of time the Bareshnûm ceremony must be continued (see Vend. IX,
144, XIX, 80). The 'Navashâ*d*ar rite' is, therefore, 'the ceremony of
the nine nights,' which should be frequently undergone by the priests
who celebrate the Vendidad ceremonial.

<span id="fn_1726"></span>[349:3](sbe0572.htm#fr_1738.md) M6 has pavan
pî*s*ak, 'with ceremony.'

<span id="fn_1727"></span>[349:4](sbe0572.htm#fr_1739.md) M6 has 'them.'

<span id="fn_1728"></span>[349:5](sbe0572.htm#fr_1740.md) M6 has '*one*
knows it is unto the cup and bull's urine;' but as M6 was evidently
copied from a MS. already nearly illegible in some places, it is
generally safer to follow K20, except when M6 supplies words omitted by
the more careless writer of K20.

<span id="fn_1729"></span>[350:1](sbe0572.htm#fr_1741.md) The passage here
quoted from the Gâthas will be found in Pahl. Yas. XXXII, 7.

<span id="fn_1730"></span>[350:2](sbe0572.htm#fr_1742.md) M6 has merely
'through the good works which are practised by him;' but K20 has '1
hamak' inserted at this point, which seems to indicate the existence of
the nearly identical Pahlavi letters kâmak, 'desire,' in the original
from which it was copied.

<span id="fn_1731"></span>[350:3](sbe0572.htm#fr_1743.md) See Chap. X, 4.
The passage here quoted was no doubt contained in that part of the Nask
which treated of the exhibition of heaven and hell to Zaratû*s*t, which
must have been very similar to the Ar*d*â-Vîrâf-nâmak, in which most of
the details of this story about Davâns are given (see AV. XXXII).

<span id="fn_1732"></span>[350:4](sbe0572.htm#fr_1744.md) This is, no
doubt, the Av. davãs of Yas. XXXI, 10, which may be translated
'hypocrite.' The Pahlavi translation of the line in which the word
occurs is thus rendered in Haug's Essays (p. 351): 'Aûharmazd does not
allot to him who is an idler, the infidel who is any hypocrite (davãs)
in the sacred recitations. In the good religion it is asserted that even
as much reward as they give to the hypocrite they, do not give to the
infidel.'

<span id="fn_1733"></span>[350:5](sbe0572.htm#fr_1745.md) K20 has
'thirty-four.'

<span id="fn_1734"></span>[351:1](sbe0572.htm#fr_1746.md) Here written
gêtôk-kharî*d*, but see Chap. V, 6, and Bund. XXX, 28.

<span id="fn_1735"></span>[351:2](sbe0572.htm#fr_1747.md) See B. Yt. III,
25; but the passage here quoted is not clearly indicated in the accounts
we have of the contents of this Nask.

<span id="fn_1736"></span>[351:3](sbe0572.htm#fr_1748.md) The distinction
between these ceremonies and those whose values as good works are given
in Chap. XVI, 6, appears to be that any omission in performing these
five at their proper times amounts; to an absolute sin, whereas the
others are not so indispensable.

<span id="fn_1737"></span>[351:4](sbe0572.htm#fr_1749.md) That is, they
will be taken into account at the judgment on the soul's actions at the
*K*inva*d* bridge (see Bund. XII, 7).

<span id="fn_1738"></span>[351:5](sbe0572.htm#fr_1750.md) See Chap. X, 21.
The passage here quoted was probably in the section called Nîrangistân.

<span id="fn_1739"></span>[351:6](sbe0572.htm#fr_1751.md) The Gâsânbârs or
Gâhanbârs (see Bund. XXV, 1-6).

<span id="fn_1740"></span>[352:1](sbe0572.htm#fr_1752.md) The midday period
(see Bund. II, 8; 9, XXV, 9-14).

<span id="fn_1741"></span>[352:2](sbe0572.htm#fr_1753.md) See Chap. VIII,
6.

<span id="fn_1742"></span>[352:3](sbe0572.htm#fr_1754.md) See Chap. X, 2.

<span id="fn_1743"></span>[352:4](sbe0572.htm#fr_1755.md) See Chap. VII,
1-5.

<span id="fn_1744"></span>[352:5](sbe0572.htm#fr_1756.md) See Bund. I, 21,
XX, 2.

<span id="fn_1745"></span>[352:6](sbe0572.htm#fr_1757.md) That is, it is
commendable, though not obligatory. The practice of uttering a blessing
on hearing a sneeze is still common in many parts of Europe.

<span id="fn_1746"></span>[352:7](sbe0572.htm#fr_1758.md) See B. Yt. I, 1.
The passage here quoted is not to be traced in any of the accounts of
this Nask.

<span id="fn_1747"></span>[352:8](sbe0572.htm#fr_1759.md) 'The Ahunavar and
praise of righteousness' would be a Pahlavi equivalent for 'the
Yathâ-ahû-vairyô and Ashem-vohû.'
