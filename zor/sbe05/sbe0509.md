### OBSERVATIONS.

1\. For all divisions into chapters and sections the translator is
responsible, as the original text is written continuously, with very few
stops marked.

2\. Italics are used for any English words which are not expressed, or
fully understood, in the original text, but are added to complete the
sense of the translation.

3\. Oriental words are usually 'spaced.' Italics occurring in them, or
in names, are intended to represent certain peculiar Oriental letters.
The italic consonants *d*, *n*, *v* may be pronounced as in English; but
*g* should be sounded like j, *hv* like wh, *k* like ch in 'church,' N
like ng, *s* like sh, *z* like French j. For further information, see
'Transliteration of Oriental Alphabets adopted for the Translations of
the Sacred Books of the East' at the end of the volume.

4\. In Pahlavi words all circumflexed vowels and any final ŏ are
expressed in the Pahlavi original, but all other vowels are merely
understood.

5\. In the translation, words in parentheses are merely explanatory of
those which precede them.

6\. Abbreviations used are:—Av. for Avesta. Dâ*d*. for Dâ*d*istân-i
Dînîk. Huz. for Huzvâri*s*. Mkh. for Mainyô-i-khar*d*, ed. West. Pahl.
for Pahlavi. Pâz. for Pâzand. Pers. for Persian. Sans. for Sanskrit.
Vend. for Vendîdâd, ed. Spiegel. Visp. for Visparad, ed. Sp. Yas. for
Yasna, ed. Sp. Yt. for Ya*s*t, ed. Westergaard.

7\. The manuscripts mentioned in the notes are:—

K20 (about 500 years old), No. 20 in the University Library at
Kopenhagen.

K20b (uncertain date), a fragment of the text, No. 20b in the same
library.

M6 (written A.D. 1397), No. 6 of the Haug Collection in the State
Library at Munich.
