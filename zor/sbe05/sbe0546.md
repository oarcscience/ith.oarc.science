### CHAPTER II.

On the coming in of Aharman to the creatures it is thus declared in
revelation, that *in* the month Fravar*d*în *and* the day Aûharmazd, at
noon <span id="fr_925"></span>[1](#fn_919.md), he came forth to the
frontier of the sky. 2. The sky sees *him* and, on account of *his*
nature, fears as much as a sheep trembles at a wolf; *and* Aharman came
on, scorching *and* burning into it. 3. Then he came to the water which
was arranged below the earth <span id="fr_926"></span>[2](#fn_920.md), and
darkness without an eyelid was brought on by him; and he came on,
through the middle of the earth, as a snake all-leaping comes on out of
a hole; and he stayed within the whole earth. 4. The passage where he
came on is his own, the way to hell, through which the demons make the
wicked run.

5\. Afterwards, he came to a tree, such as was of a single root, the
height of which *was* several feet, and *it was* without branches and
without bark, juicy *and* sweet; and to keep the strength of. all kinds
of trees in its race, it was in the vicinity of the-middle of the earth;
and at the self-same time *it became* quite withered <span
id="fr_927"></span>[3](#fn_921.md).

6\. Afterwards, he came to the ox, the sole-created <span
id="fr_928"></span>[4](#fn_922.md), as it stood as high as Gâyômar*d* on
the

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

bank of the water of Dâîtih <span id="fr_929"></span>[1](#fn_923.md) *in*
the middle of the earth; and its distance from Gâyômar*d* being as much
as its own height, it was also distant from the bank of the water of
Dâîtih by the same measure; and it was a female, white *and* brilliant
as the moon. 7. As the adversary came upon *it* Aûharmazd gave *it* a
narcotic, which is also called 'bang,' to eat, and to rub the 'bang'
before the eye <span id="fr_930"></span>[2](#fn_924.md), so that the
annoyance from the assault of crimes may be less; it became lean and
ill, *and* fell upon its right breast <span
id="fr_931"></span>[3](#fn_925.md) trembling.

8\. Before the advance to Gâyômar*d*, who was then about one-third the
height of Zaratû*s*t, *and* was brilliant as the sun; Aûharmazd forms,
from the sweat <span id="fr_932"></span>[4](#fn_926.md) on the man, a
figure of fifteen years, radiant *and* tall, and sends it on to
Gâyômar*d*; and, he also brings his sweat <span
id="fr_933"></span>[5](#fn_927.md) on to him as long as one
Yathâ-ahû-vairyô <span id="fr_934"></span>[6](#fn_928.md) is *being*
recited. 9. When he issued from the sweat, and raised his eyes, he saw.
the world when it was dark as night <span
id="fr_935"></span>[7](#fn_929.md); on the whole earth were the snake, the
scorpion, the lizard (vazak), and noxious creatures of many kinds; *and*
so the other kinds of quadrupeds stood among the

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

reptiles; every approach of the whole earth was as though not as much as
a needle's point remained, in which there was no rush of noxious
creatures. 10. *There were* the coming of a planetary *star* into
planetary conjunction, and the moon and planets at sixes and
sevens <span id="fr_936"></span>[1](#fn_930.md); many dark forms with the
face and curls of A*z*-i Dahâk suffered punishment in company with
certain non-Iranians; *and* he was amazed at calling the wicked out from
the righteous.

11\. Lastly, he (Aharman) came up to the fire, and mingled darkness and
smoke with it <span id="fr_937"></span>[2](#fn_931.md).

<span id="fn_922"></span>[161:4](sbe0546.htm#fr_928.md) The primeval ox, or
first-created representative of animals, as Gâyômar*d* was of mankind;
from which two representatives all mankind and animals are said to have
been afterwards developed. There seems to have been some doubt as to the
sex of this mythological ox; here it is distinctly stated to have been a
female, but from Bund. X, 1, 2, XIV, 3, it would appear to have been a
male, and this seems to be admitted by Dâ*d*-sparam himself, in Chap.
IX, 7.

<span id="fn_923"></span>[162:1](sbe0546.htm#fr_929.md) The Dâîtîk river
(see Bund. XX, 13).

<span id="fn_924"></span>[162:2](sbe0546.htm#fr_930.md) This is a
misunderstanding of the corresponding phrase in Bund. III, 18. The
narcotic here mentioned is usually prepared from the hemp plant, and is
well known in India and the neighbouring countries.

<span id="fn_925"></span>[162:3](sbe0546.htm#fr_931.md) See Bund. IV, 1.

<span id="fn_926"></span>[162:4](sbe0546.htm#fr_932.md) The word which, as
it stands in the MS., looks like hômanâe, is here taken as a
transposition of min khvâe, in accordance with Bund. III, 19; but it may
be a variant of anumâe, 'embryo,' in which case the translation should
be, 'forms an embryo into the shape of a man of fifteen years.'

<span id="fn_927"></span>[162:5](sbe0546.htm#fr_933.md) Or it may be
'sleep,' both here and in § 9.

<span id="fn_928"></span>[162:6](sbe0546.htm#fr_934.md) See Bund. I, 21.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[162:7](sbe0546.htm#fr_935.md) Bund. III, 20.

<span id="fn_930"></span>[163:1](sbe0546.htm#fr_936.md) Literally, 'in
fours and fives.'
