### CHAPTER XX.

1\. On the nature of rivers it says in revelation, that these two rivers
flow forth from the north, part from Albûr*z* *and* part from the
Albûr*z* of

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Aûharmazd <span
id="fr_379"></span>[1](#fn_376.md); one towards the west, that is the
Arag <span id="fr_380"></span>[2](#fn_377.md), *and* one towards the east,
that is the Vêh river. 2. After them eighteen rivers flowed forth from
the same source, just as the remaining waters have flowed forth from
them in great multitude; as they say that they flowed out so very fast,
one from the other, as when a man recites one Ashem-vohû <span
id="fr_381"></span>[3](#fn_378) of a series (pa*d*îsâr.md). All of those,
with the same water, are again mingled with these rivers, that is, the
Arag river *and* Vêh river. 4. Both of them continually circulate
through the two extremities of the earth, and pass into the sea; and all
the regions feast owing to the discharge (zahâk) of both, which, after
both arrive together at the wide-formed ocean, returns to the sources
whence they flowed out; as it says in revelation, that just as the light
comes in through Albûr*z* *and* goes out through Albûr*z* <span
id="fr_382"></span>[4](#fn_379.md), the

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

water also comes out through Albûr*z* and goes away through Albûr*z*. 5.
This, too, it says, that the spirit of the Arag begged of Aûharmazd
thus: 'O first omniscient creative power <span
id="fr_383"></span>[1](#fn_380.md)! from whom the Vêh river begged for the
welfare that thou mightest grant, do thou then grant *it* in my
quantity!' 6. The spirit of the Vêh river similarly begged of Aûharmazd
for the Arag river; *and* on account of loving assistance, one towards
the other, they flowed forth with equal strength, as before the coming
of the destroyer they proceeded without rapids, and when the fiend shall
be destroyed <span id="fr_384"></span>[2](#fn_381.md) they *will* again be
without rapids.

7\. Of those eighteen principal rivers, distinct from the Arag river
*and* Vêh river, and the other rivers which flow out from them, I *will*
mention the more famous <span id="fr_385"></span>[3](#fn_382.md): the Arag
river, the Vêh river, the Diglat <span id="fr_386"></span>[4](#fn_383.md)
river they call also again the Vêh river <span
id="fr_387"></span>[5](#fn_384.md), the Frât river, the Dâîtîk river, the
Dargâm river, the Zôndak river, the Harôî river, the Marv river, the
Hêtûmand river, the Akhôshir river, the Nâvadâ <span
id="fr_388"></span>[6](#fn_385.md) river, the Zî*s*mand river, the
Khve*g*and river, the Balkh river, the Mehrvâ river they call the Hendvâ
river, the Spêd <span id="fr_389"></span>[7](#fn_386.md) river, the
Rad <span id="fr_390"></span>[8](#fn_387.md) river which they call also the
Koir, the Khvaraê river which they call

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

also the Mesrgân, the Harhaz <span id="fr_391"></span>[1](#fn_388.md)
river, the Teremet river, the Khvanaîdi*s* <span
id="fr_392"></span>[2](#fn_389.md) river, the Dâra*g*a river, the Kâsîk
river, the *S*êd <span id="fr_393"></span>[3](#fn_390) ('shining'.md) river
Pêdâ-meyan *or* *K*atru-meyan river *of* Mokarstân.

8\. I *will* mention them also a second time: the Arag <span
id="fr_394"></span>[4](#fn_391.md) river is that of which it is said that
it comes out from Albûr*z* in the land of Sûrâk <span
id="fr_395"></span>[5](#fn_392.md), *in* which they call it also the Âmi;
it passes on through the land of Spêtos, which they also call Mesr, and
they call it there the river Niv <span id="fr_396"></span>[6](#fn_393.md).
9. The Vêh <span id="fr_397"></span>[7](#fn_394.md) river

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

passes on in the east, goes through the land of Sînd <span
id="fr_398"></span>[1](#fn_395.md), *and* flows to the sea in Hindûstân,
and they call it there the Mehrâ <span id="fr_399"></span>[2](#fn_396.md)
river. 10. The sources of the Frât <span id="fr_400"></span>[3](#fn_397.md)
river are from the frontier of Arûm, they feed *upon it* in Sûristân,
*and* it flows to the Diglat river; and of this Frât *it is* <span
id="fr_401"></span>[4](#fn_398.md) that they produce irrigation over the
land. 11. It is declared that Mânû*sk*îhar excavated the sources, *and*
cast back the water all to one place, as it says thus 'I reverence the
Frât, full of fish, which Mânû*sk*îhar excavated for *the benefit of*
his own soul, *and* he seized the water *and* gave to drink <span
id="fr_402"></span>[5](#fn_399.md),' 12. The Diglat <span
id="fr_403"></span>[6](#fn_400.md) river comes out from Salmân <span
id="fr_404"></span>[7](#fn_401.md), *and* flows to the sea in Khû*g*îstân.
13. The Dâîtîk <span id="fr_405"></span>[8](#fn_402.md) river is the river

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

*which* comes out from Aîrân-vê*g*, *and* goes out through the
hill-country <span id="fr_406"></span>[1](#fn_403.md); of all rivers the
noxious creatures in it are most, as it says, that the Dâîtîk river is
full of noxious creatures. 14. The Dargâm river is in Sûde. 15. The
Zend <span id="fr_407"></span>[2](#fn_404.md) river passes through the
mountains of Pan*g*istân, *and* flows away to the Haro river. 16. The
Haro <span id="fr_408"></span>[3](#fn_405.md) river flows out from the
Apârsên range <span id="fr_409"></span>[4](#fn_406.md). 17. The
Hêtûmand <span id="fr_410"></span>[5](#fn_407.md) river is in Sagastân, and
its sources are from the Apârsên range; this is distinct from that which
Frâsîyâ*v* conducted away <span id="fr_411"></span>[6](#fn_408.md). 18. The
river Akhôshir is in Kûmî*s* <span id="fr_412"></span>[7](#fn_409.md). 19.
The Zî*s*mand <span id="fr_413"></span>[8](#fn_410.md) river, in the
direction

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

of Soghd, flows away towards the Khve*g*and river. 20. The
Khve*g*and <span id="fr_414"></span>[1](#fn_411.md) river goes on through
the midst of Samarkand *and* Pargâna, and they call it also the river
Ashârd. 21. The Marv <span id="fr_415"></span>[2](#fn_412.md) river, a
glorious river in the east <span id="fr_416"></span>[3](#fn_413.md), flows
out from the Apârsên range. 22. The Balkh river comes out *from* the
Apârsên mountain of Bâmîkân <span id="fr_417"></span>[4](#fn_414.md), *and*
flows on to the Vêh <span id="fr_418"></span>[5](#fn_415.md) river. 23. The
Spêd <span id="fr_419"></span>[6](#fn_416.md) river is in Âtarô-pâtakân;
they say that Dahâk begged a favour <span
id="fr_420"></span>[7](#fn_417.md) here from Aharman and the demons. 24.
The Tort <span id="fr_421"></span>[8](#fn_418.md) river, which they call
also the Koir, comes out from

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

the sea of Gîklân <span id="fr_422"></span>[1](#fn_419.md), *and* flows to
the sea of Vergân <span id="fr_423"></span>[2](#fn_420.md). 25. The
Zahâvayi <span id="fr_424"></span>[3](#fn_421.md) is the river *which*
comes out from Âtarô-pâtakân, *and* flows to the sea in Pârs. 26. The
sources of the Khvaraê <span id="fr_425"></span>[4](#fn_422.md) river are
from Spâhân <span id="fr_426"></span>[5](#fn_423.md); it passes on through
Khû*g*îstân, flows forth to the Diglat <span
id="fr_427"></span>[6](#fn_424.md) river, and in Spâhân they call it the
Mesrkân <span id="fr_428"></span>[7](#fn_425.md) river. 27. The
Harhaz <span id="fr_429"></span>[8](#fn_426.md) river is in Taparîstân, and
its sources are from Mount Dimâvand. 28. The Teremet <span
id="fr_430"></span>[9](#fn_427.md) river flows away to the Vêh river. 29.
The Vendese*s* <span id="fr_431"></span>[10](#fn_428.md) river is in *that
part of* Pârs which they call Sagastân. 30. The Kâsak <span
id="fr_432"></span>[11](#fn_429) river comes out through a ravine (kâf.md)
in the province of Tûs <span id="fr_433"></span>[12](#fn_430.md), and they
call it there the Kasp river; moreover,

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

the river, which is there the Vêh, they call the Kâsak <span
id="fr_434"></span>[1](#fn_431.md); even in Sînd they call *it* the Kâsak.
31. The Pê*d*âk-mîyân <span id="fr_435"></span>[2](#fn_432.md), which is
the river *K*atru-mîyân, is that which is in Kangde*z* <span
id="fr_436"></span>[3](#fn_433.md). 32. The Dâra*g*a river is in
Aîrân-vê*g*, on the bank (bâr) of which was the dwelling of Pôrûshasp,
the father of Zaratû*s*t <span id="fr_437"></span>[4](#fn_434.md). 33. The
other innumerable waters and rivers, springs *and* channels are one in
origin with those <span id="fr_438"></span>[5](#fn_435.md); so in various
districts *and* various places they call *them* by various names.

34\. Regarding Frâsîyâ*v* <span id="fr_439"></span>[6](#fn_436.md) they
say, that a thousand springs were conducted away by him into the sea
Kyânsîh <span id="fr_440"></span>[7](#fn_437.md), suitable for horses,
suitable for camels, suitable for oxen, suitable for asses, both great
and small <span id="fr_441"></span>[8](#fn_438.md); and he conducted the
spring Zarînmand (or golden source), which is the Hêtûmand <span
id="fr_442"></span>[9](#fn_439.md) river they say, into the same sea; and
he conducted the seven navigable waters of the source of the
Va*k*aêni <span id="fr_443"></span>[10](#fn_440.md) river into the same
sea, *and* made men settle *there*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_376"></span>[75:1](sbe0529.htm#fr_379.md) So in K20, and if
correct (being only partially confirmed by the fragment of this chapter
found in all MSS. between Chaps. XIII and XIV) this reading implies that
the rivers are derived partly from the mountains of Albûr*z*, and partly
from the celestial Albûr*z*, or the clouds in the sky. M6 has 'flow
forth from the north part of the eastern Albûr*z*.'

<span id="fn_377"></span>[75:2](sbe0529.htm#fr_380.md) For further details
regarding these two semi-mythical rivers see §§ 8, 9.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[75:3](sbe0529.htm#fr_381.md) The sacred formula
most frequently recited by the Parsis, and often several times in
succession, like the Pater-noster of some Christians; it is not,
however, a prayer, but a declaratory formula in 'praise of
righteousness' (which phrase is often used as its name in Pahlavi). It
consists of twelve Avesta words, as follows:

Ashem vohû vahi*s*tem astî,  
u*s*tâ astî; u*s*tâ ahmâi  
hya*d* ashâi vahi*s*tâi ashem.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And it may be
translated in the following manner: 'Righteousness is the best good, a
blessing it is; a blessing be to that which is righteousness to perfect
rectitude' (Asha-vahi*s*ta the archangel).

<span id="fn_379"></span>[75:4](sbe0529.htm#fr_382.md) See Chap. V, 5.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[76:1](sbe0529.htm#fr_383.md) So in M6, but K20
has, 'First is the propitiation of all kinds.'

<span id="fn_381"></span>[76:2](sbe0529.htm#fr_384.md) Literally, 'when
they shall destroy the fiend.'

<span id="fn_382"></span>[76:3](sbe0529.htm#fr_385.md) For details
regarding these rivers see the sequel.

<span id="fn_383"></span>[76:4](sbe0529.htm#fr_386.md) The Pâz. Deyrid is
evidently a misreading of Pahl. Diglat or Digrat, which occurs in § 12.

<span id="fn_384"></span>[76:5](sbe0529.htm#fr_387.md) So in K20, but M6
(omitting two words) has, 'they call also the Didgar.'

<span id="fn_385"></span>[76:6](sbe0529.htm#fr_388.md) No further details
are given, in this chapter, about this river, but it seems to be the
river Nâhvtâk of Chap. XXI, 6, the Nâîvtâk of Chap. XXIX, 4. 5.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[76:7](sbe0529.htm#fr_389.md) K20 has 'Spend.'

<span id="fn_387"></span>[76:8](sbe0529.htm#fr_390.md) Called Tort in § 24.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[77:1](sbe0529.htm#fr_391.md) Miswritten Araz in
Pâzand, both here and in § 27.

<span id="fn_389"></span>[77:2](sbe0529.htm#fr_392.md) M6 has
Khvanaînidi*s*, but in K20 it is doubtful whether the extra syllable
(which is interlined) is intended to be inserted or substituted; the
shorter form is, however, more reconcilable with the Pahlavi form of
Vendese*s* in § 29.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[77:3](sbe0529.htm#fr_393.md) As there is no
description of any *S*êd river it is probably only an epithet of the
Pêdâ-meyan or *K*atru-meyan (pê*d*âk being the usual Pahlavi equivalent
of Av. *k*ithrô). Justi suggests that Mokarstân (Mokarsta rû*d* in M6)
stands for Pers. Moghulstân, 'the country of the Moghuls,' but this is
doubtful.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[77:4](sbe0529.htm#fr_394.md) Sometimes written
Arang or Arêng, but the nasal is usually omitted; it is the Av. Rangha
of Âbân Yt. 63, Rashnu Yt. 18, Râm Yt. 27, which is described more like
a lake or sea in Vend. I, 77, Bahrâm Yt. 29. This semi-mythical river is
supposed to encompass a great part of the known world (see Chap. VII,
16), and the Bundahi*s* probably means to trace its course down the Âmû
(Oxus) from Sogdiana, across the Caspian, up the Aras (Araxes) or the
Kur (Cyrus), through the Euxine and Mediterranean, and up the Nile to
the Indian Ocean. The Âmû (Oxus) is also sometimes considered a part of
the Vêh river or Indus (see §§ 22, 28).

<span id="fn_392"></span>[77:5](sbe0529.htm#fr_395.md) Sogdiana (see Chap.
XV, 29), the country of the Âmû river.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[77:6](sbe0529.htm#fr_396.md) The combination of
the three names in this clause, as Justi observes, renders it probable
that we should read, 'the land of Egypt,' which is called Misr, and
where the river is the Nile. The letter S in Pâz. Spêtos is very like an
obsolete form of Av. g, or it may be read as Pahl. îk or îg, so the name
may originally have been Gpêtos or Ikpêtos; and the Pâz. Niv, if
transcribed into Pahlavi, can also be read Nîl.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[77:7](sbe0529.htm#fr_397.md) The 'good' river,
which, with the Arag and the ocean, completes <span id="page_78">p.
78</span> the circuit of the known world, and is evidently identified
with the Indus; sometimes it seems also to include the Âmû (Oxus), as
Bactria was considered a part of India; thus we find the Balkh and
Teremet rivers flowing into the Vêh (see §§ 22, 28).

<span id="fn_395"></span>[78:1](sbe0529.htm#fr_398.md) See § 30.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[78:2](sbe0529.htm#fr_399.md) No doubt the Mehrvâ
or Hendvâ river of § 7, and the Mihrân of Ouseley's Oriental Geography
of the pseudo Ibn ‘Haûqal, pp. 148-155, which appears to combine the
Satli*g* and lower Indus. The final n is usually omitted by the
Bundahi*s* after â in Pâzand words. This river is also called Kâsak (see
§ 30).

<span id="fn_397"></span>[78:3](sbe0529.htm#fr_400.md) The Euphrates, which
rises in Armenia (part of the eastern empire of the Romans), traverses
Syria, and joins the Tigris.

<span id="fn_398"></span>[78:4](sbe0529.htm#fr_401.md) Or, 'and its
convenience is this;' a play upon the words farhat and Frât, which are
identical in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[78:5](sbe0529.htm#fr_402.md) Referring probably
to canals for irrigation along the course of the Euphrates.

<span id="fn_400"></span>[78:6](sbe0529.htm#fr_403.md) The Tigris (Arabic
Di*g*lat), Hiddekel of Gen. ii. 14, Dan. x. 4, and perhaps the Av.
tighri*s* of Tî*s*tar Yt. 6, 37; misread Dêîrid in Pâzand.

<span id="fn_401"></span>[78:7](sbe0529.htm#fr_404.md) The country of Salm
(see Chap. XV, 29), son of Frê*d*ûn (see Chap. XXXI, 9, 10). The name
can also be read Dîlmân, which is the name of a place in the same
neighbourhood.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[78:8](sbe0529.htm#fr_405.md) The Av. Dâitya of
Vend. XIX, 5, Aûharmazd Yt. 21, Âbân Yt. 112, Gô*s* Yt. 29. The 'good
dâitya of Airyana-vaê*g*ô' is also <span id="page_79">p. 79</span>
mentioned in Vend. I, 6, II, 42, 43, Âbân Yt. 17, 104, Râm Yt. 2, but
this may not be a river, though the phrase has, no doubt, led to
locating the river Dâîtîk in Aîrân-vê*g*.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[79:1](sbe0529.htm#fr_406.md) Pâz. gopestân in
K20, which is evidently Pahl. kôfistân, but not the Kôhistân of southern
Persia. M6 has 'the mountain of Pan*g*istân,' which must be incorrect,
as according to §§ 15, 16, this is in north-east Khurâsân, and too far
from Aîrân-vê*g* in Âtarô-pâtakân (Âdar-bî*g*ân), see Chap. XXIX, 12.
Justi proposes to read Gur*g*istân (Georgia), and identifies the Dâîtîk
with the Araxes, but, adhering to the text of K20, the Dâîtîk rises in
Âdar-bî*g*ân and departs through a hill-country, a description
applicable, not only to the Araxes, but also more particularly to the
Safêd Rûd or white river; although this river seems to be mentioned
again as the Spêd or Spend river in § 23.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[79:2](sbe0529.htm#fr_407.md) Written Zôndak in §
7. This can hardly be the Zendah river of Ispahan, but is probably the
Te*g*end river, which flows past Meshhed into the Heri river.

<span id="fn_405"></span>[79:3](sbe0529.htm#fr_408.md) This is the Heri,
which flows past Herat.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[79:4](sbe0529.htm#fr_409.md) See Chap. XII, 9.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[79:5](sbe0529.htm#fr_410.md) The Etymander of
classical writers, now the Hêlmand in Afghânistân. The Av. Haêtumat of
Vend. I, 50, XIX, 130, Zamyâd Yt. 66, is the name of the country through
which it flows.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[79:6](sbe0529.htm#fr_411.md) See § 34 and Chap.
XXI, 6.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[79:7](sbe0529.htm#fr_412.md) The district about
Dâmaghân.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[79:8](sbe0529.htm#fr_413.md) Perhaps the
Zaraf*s*ân.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[80:1](sbe0529.htm#fr_414.md) This is evidently
not the small affluent now called the Khu*g*and, but the great Syr-darya
or Iaxartes, which flows through the provinces of Farghânah and
Samarkand, past Kokand, Khu*g*and, and Tashkand, into the Aral. The Pâz.
Ashârd represents Pahl. Khshârt, or Ashârt (Iaxartes).

<span id="fn_412"></span>[80:2](sbe0529.htm#fr_415.md) The Murghâb.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[80:3](sbe0529.htm#fr_416.md) Or, 'in Khûrâsân.'

<span id="fn_414"></span>[80:4](sbe0529.htm#fr_417.md) Bâmian, near which
the river of Balkh has its source.

<span id="fn_415"></span>[80:5](sbe0529.htm#fr_418.md) Justi observes that
it should be 'the Arag river;' but according to an Armenian writer of
the seventh century the Persians called the Oxus the Vêh river, and
considered it to be in India, because Buddhists occupied the country on
its banks (see Garrez in Journal Asiatique for 1869, pp. 161-198). It
would seem, therefore, that the Oxus was sometimes (or in early times)
considered a part of the Arag (Araxes), and sometimes (or in later
times) a part of the Vêh (Indus).

<span id="fn_416"></span>[80:6](sbe0529.htm#fr_419.md) So in M6, but K20
has 'Spend,' both here and in § 7. The name of this river corresponds
with that of the Safêd Rûd, although the position of that river agrees
best with the account given of the Dâîtîk in § 13.

<span id="fn_417"></span>[80:7](sbe0529.htm#fr_420.md) Compare Râm Yt. 19,
20. K20 has 'there,' instead of 'here.'

<span id="fn_418"></span>[80:8](sbe0529.htm#fr_421.md) Called Rad in § 7
(by the loss of the first letter of the original Pahlavi name); by its
alternative name, Koir, Justi identifies it as the Kûr in Georgia,
flowing into the Caspian, or sea of Vergân, the Av. Vehrkâna (Hyrcania)
of Vend. I, 42, which is Gûrgân in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[81:1](sbe0529.htm#fr_422.md) M6 has Pâz. Keyâseh,
but this is in Sagastân (see Chap. XIII, 16).

<span id="fn_420"></span>[81:2](sbe0529.htm#fr_423.md) The MSS. have Vergâ,
but the final nasal after i is often omitted in Pâzand reading in the
Bundahi*s*.

<span id="fn_421"></span>[81:3](sbe0529.htm#fr_424.md) Not mentioned in §
7. Possibly one of the rivers Zâb, which rise on the borders of
Âdarbî*g*ân, flow into the Tigris, and so reach the Persian Gulf, the
sea on the coast of Pârs. Or it may be the Shirvân, another affluent of
the Tigris, which flows through the district of Zohab.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[81:4](sbe0529.htm#fr_425.md) The Kuran, upon
which the town of Shûstar was founded by one of the early Sasanian
kings, who also dug a canal, east of the town, so as to form a loop
branch of the river; this canal was called Nahr-i Masrûqân by Oriental
geographers (see Rawlinson, journal Roy. Geogr. Soc. vol. ix. pp.
73-75).

<span id="fn_423"></span>[81:5](sbe0529.htm#fr_426.md) Ispahân in Persian.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[81:6](sbe0529.htm#fr_427.md) Miswritten Dayrid in
Pâzand (see § 12).

<span id="fn_425"></span>[81:7](sbe0529.htm#fr_428.md) Written in Pâzand
without the final n, as usual. This is the old name of the canal forming
the eastern branch of the Kuran at Shûstar, it is now called Âb-i
Gargar.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[81:8](sbe0529.htm#fr_429.md) Flows into the
Caspian near Amûl.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[81:9](sbe0529.htm#fr_430.md) Probably the river
which flows into the Âmû (Oxus) at Tarmaz; but, in that case, the Oxus
is here again identified with the Vêh (Indus) as in § 22, instead of the
Arag (Araxes) as in § 8.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[81:10](sbe0529.htm#fr_431.md) Called
Khvanaîdi*s*, or Khvanaînidi*s*, in § 7.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[81:11](sbe0529.htm#fr_432.md) Called Kâsîk in §
7.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[81:12](sbe0529.htm#fr_433.md) Close to Meshhed.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[82:1](sbe0529.htm#fr_434.md) Or, 'this same Vêh
river they call there the Kâsak; even in Sênî they call *it* the Kâsak;'
Sênî is apt to be miswritten Sênd or Sînd (see Chap. XV, 29).

<span id="fn_432"></span>[82:2](sbe0529.htm#fr_435.md) See § 7. The latter
half of both names can also be read mâhan, mâhô, or mahân. Pêshyôtan,
son of Vi*s*tâsp, seems to have taken a surname from this river (see
Chap. XXIX, 5).

<span id="fn_433"></span>[82:3](sbe0529.htm#fr_436.md) See Chap. XXIX, 10.

<span id="fn_434"></span>[82:4](sbe0529.htm#fr_437.md) See Chaps. XXIV, 15,
XXXII, 1, 2.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[82:5](sbe0529.htm#fr_438.md) Or, 'are from those
as a source.'

<span id="fn_436"></span>[82:6](sbe0529.htm#fr_439.md) The MSS. have
'Pôrûshasp,' but compare § 17 and Chap. XXI, 6. The two names are
somewhat alike in Pahlavi writing.

<span id="fn_437"></span>[82:7](sbe0529.htm#fr_440.md) See Chap. XIII, 16.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[82:8](sbe0529.htm#fr_441.md) Compare Chap. XIX,
6. K20 omits the words 'suitable for asses' here.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[82:9](sbe0529.htm#fr_442.md) Another Hêtûmand
according to § 17. Possibly a dried-up bed of that river.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[82:10](sbe0529.htm#fr_443.md) K20 has Vataêni;
*k* and t being much alike in Pâzand. The <span id="page_83">p.
83</span> 'navigable (nâvtâk) waters' may be 'the Nâvadâ river' of § 7,
'the river Nâîvtâk' of Chap. XXI, 6, and Nâîvtâk of Chap. XXIX, 4, 5.
