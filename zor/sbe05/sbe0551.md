### CHAPTER VII.

1\. And as he (Aharman) came thirdly to the earth, which arrayed the
whole earth against him—

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

since *there was* an animation of the earth through the
shattering—Albûr*z* grew up <span id="fr_981"></span>[1](#fn_975.md), which
is the boundary of the earth, *and* the other <span
id="fr_982"></span>[2](#fn_976.md) mountains, which are amid the circuit of
the earth, come up 2244 in number <span id="fr_983"></span>[3](#fn_977.md).
2. And by them the earth *was* bound together and arranged, and on them
*was* the sprouting and growth of plants, wherefrom *was* the
nourishment of cattle, and therefrom was the great advantage of
assistance to men.

3\. Even so it is declared that before the coming of the destroyer to
the creatures, for a thousand years the substance of mountains was
created in the earth—especially as antagonism came on the earth, *and*
settled on *it* with injury—*and* it came up over the earth just like a
tree *whose* branch *has* grown at the top, and its root at the bottom.
4. The root of the mountains is passed on *from* one to the other, *and*
is arranged in connection *with them*, and through it is produced the
path *and* passage of water *from* below to above, so that the water may
flow in it in such manner as blood in the veins, from all *parts* of the
body to the heart, the latent vigour which they possess. 5. And,
moreover, in six hundred years <span id="fr_984"></span>[4](#fn_978.md), at
first, all the mountains apart from Albûr*z* were completed. 6. Albûr*z*
was growing during eight hundred years <span
id="fr_985"></span>[5](#fn_979.md); in two hundred years it grew up to

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

the star station, in two hundred years up to the moon station, two
hundred years up to the sun station, *and* two hundred years up to the
sky. 7. After Albûr*z* the Aparsên mountain <span
id="fr_986"></span>[1](#fn_980.md) is the greatest, as it is also called
the Avar-rôyi*s*n <span id="fr_987"></span>[2](#fn_981) (up-growth'.md)
mountain, whose beginning is in Sagastân and its end unto Pârs and to
*K*înîstân <span id="fr_988"></span>[3](#fn_982.md).

8\. This, too, is declared, that after the great rain in the beginning
of the creation <span id="fr_989"></span>[4](#fn_983.md), *and* the wind's
sweeping away the water to the ocean, the earth is in seven
portions <span id="fr_990"></span>[5](#fn_984.md), a little above *it*, as
the compact earth, after the rain, is torn up by the noise and wind *in*
various places. 9. One portion, moreover, as much as one-half the whole
earth, is in the middle, and in *each of* the six portions around is as
much as Sagastân; moreover, as much as Sagastân is the measure *of what*
is called a keshvar ('region') for the reason that one was defined from
the other by a kêsh ('furrow'). 10. The middle *one* is Khvanîras, of
which Pârs is the centre, and those six regions are like a coronet
(a*v*îsar) *around it*. 11. One part of the wide-formed ocean wound
around it, among those six regions; the sea and forest seized upon the
south side, *and* a lofty mountain grew up on the north, so that they
might become separate, one from the other, *and* imperceptible.

12\. This is the third contest, about the earth.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_975"></span>[174:1](sbe0551.htm#fr_981.md) Bund. VIII, 1-4 is
paraphrased in §§ 1-4.

<span id="fn_976"></span>[174:2](sbe0551.htm#fr_982.md) The MS. has âvânŏ,
'waters,' instead of avârîk, 'other,' which alters the meaning into,
'which is the boundary of the waters of the earth, *and* the mountains,'
&c.

<span id="fn_977"></span>[174:3](sbe0551.htm#fr_983.md) Bund. XII, 2.

<span id="fn_978"></span>[174:4](sbe0551.htm#fr_984.md) Bund. VIII, 5, and
XII, 1, have 'eighteen years.' As both numbers are written in ciphers it
would be easy for either to be corrupted into the other.

<span id="fn_979"></span>[174:5](sbe0551.htm#fr_985.md) Bund. XII, 1.

<span id="fn_980"></span>[175:1](sbe0551.htm#fr_986.md) The Apârsên of
Bund. XII, 9.

<span id="fn_981"></span>[175:2](sbe0551.htm#fr_987.md) Written
Apû-rôyi*s*n, as if it were an Arabic hybrid meaning 'father of growth.'

<span id="fn_982"></span>[175:3](sbe0551.htm#fr_988.md) Bund. XII, 9. XXIV,
28, have Khû*g*îstân instead of *K*înîstân; the latter appears to be an
old name of the territory of Samarkand (see note to Bund. XII, 13).

<span id="fn_983"></span>[175:4](sbe0551.htm#fr_989.md) Literally,
'creature.'

<span id="fn_984"></span>[175:5](sbe0551.htm#fr_990.md) Bund. XI, 2-4 is
paraphrased in §§ 8-11.
