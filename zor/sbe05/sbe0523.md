### CHAPTER XIV.

1\. On the nature of the five classes of animals (gôspend) it says in
revelation, that, when the primeval ox passed away <span
id="fr_231"></span>[4](#fn_230), there where the marrow came out grain
grew up <span id="fr_232"></span>[5](#fn_231), of fifty and five
species, *and* twelve <span id="fr_233"></span>[6](#fn_232) species of
medicinal plants grew; as it says, that out of the marrow is every
separate creature, every single thing whose lodgment is in the
marrow <span id="fr_234"></span>[7](#fn_233). 2. From the horns *arose*
peas (mî*g*ûk),

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

from the nose the leek, from the blood the grapevine <span
id="fr_235"></span>[1](#fn_234) from which they make wine—on this
account wine abounds with blood—from the lungs the rue-like herbs, from
the middle of the heart <span id="fr_236"></span>[2](#fn_235) thyme
*for* keeping away stench, *and* every one of the others as revealed in
the Avesta.

3\. The seed of the ox was carried up to the moon station <span
id="fr_237"></span>[3](#fn_236); there it was thoroughly purified, *and*
produced the manifold species of animals <span
id="fr_238"></span>[4](#fn_237). 4. First, two oxen, one male and one
female, and, afterwards, one pair of every single species was let go
into the earth, *and* was discernible in Aîrân-vê*g* *for* a Hâsar
('mile'), which is like a Parasang ('league') <span
id="fr_239"></span>[5](#fn_238); as it says, that, on account of the
valuableness of the ox, it was created twice, one time as an ox, and one
time as the manifold species of animals. 5. A thousand days and nights
they were without eating, and first water and afterwards herbage
(aûrvar) were devoured by them.

6\. And, afterwards, the three classes (kar*d*ak) of animals were
produced therefrom, as it says that first were the goat and sheep, and
then the camel

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

and swine, and then the horse and ass. 7. For, first, *those* suitable
for grazing were created therefrom, those are now kept in the valley
(lâî); the second created were those of the hill summits (sar-i
dê*z*) <span id="fr_240"></span>[1](#fn_239), which are wide-travellers,
*and* habits (nihâdak) are not taught to them by hand; the third created
were *those* dwelling in the water.

8\. As for the genera (khadûînak), the first genus is that which *has*
the foot cloven in two, *and is* suitable for grazing; of which a camel
larger than a horse is small *and* new-born. 9. The second genus is
ass-footed, of which the swift <span id="fr_241"></span>[2](#fn_240)
horse is the largest, *and* the ass the least. 10. The third genus is
that of the five-dividing paw, of which the dog is the largest, *and*
the civet-cat the least. 11. The fourth genus is the flying, of which
the griffon of three natures <span id="fr_242"></span>[3](#fn_241) is
the largest, and the chaffinch <span id="fr_243"></span>[4](#fn_242) the
least. 12. The fifth genus is that of the water, of which the Kar
fish <span id="fr_244"></span>[5](#fn_243) is the largest, *and* the
Nemadu <span id="fr_245"></span>[6](#fn_244) the least.

13, These five genera are apportioned out into

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

two hundred and eighty-two <span id="fr_246"></span>[1](#fn_245) species
(sar*d*ak). 14. First are five species of goat, the ass-goat <span
id="fr_247"></span>[2](#fn_246), the milch-goat, the mountain-goat, the
fawn, *and* the *common* goat. 15. Second, five species of sheep, that
with a tail, that which has no tail, the dog-sheep, the wether, *and*
the Kûri*s*k sheep, a sheep whose horn is great; it possesses a
grandeur <span id="fr_248"></span>[3](#fn_247) like unto a horse, *and*
they use *it* mostly for a steed (bâra), as it is said that Mânû*sk*îhar
kept a Kûri*s*k as a steed. 16. Third, two species of camel, the
mountain *one and that* suitable for grazing; for one is fit to keep in
the mountain, *and* one in the plain; they are one-humped *and*
two-humped. 17. Fourth, fifteen species of ox, the white,
mud-coloured <span id="fr_249"></span>[4](#fn_248), red, yellow, black,
*and* dappled, the elk, the buffalo, the camel-leopard ox, the
fish-chewing <span id="fr_250"></span>[5](#fn_249) ox, the Far*s* ox,
the Ka*ga*u, *and* other species of ox. 18. Fifth, eight species of
horse, the Arab, the Persian, the mule <span
id="fr_251"></span>[6](#fn_250), the ass, the wild ass (gôr), the
hippopotamus (asp-i âvî), *and* other species of horse. 19. Sixth, ten
species of dog, the shepherd's dog, the village-dog which is the
house-protector, the blood-hound, the slender hound <span
id="fr_252"></span>[7](#fn_251), the

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

water-beaver <span id="fr_253"></span>[1](#fn_252) which they call the
water-dog, the fox, the ichneumon (râsu), the hedgehog which they call
'thorny-back,' the porcupine <span id="fr_254"></span>[2](#fn_253),
*and* the civet-cat; of which, two species are those accustomed <span
id="fr_255"></span>[3](#fn_254) to burrows, one the fox *and* one the
ichneumon; *and* those accustomed to jungle are such as the porcupine
which has spines on *its* back, *and* the hedgehog which is similar. 20.
Seventh, five species of the black <span id="fr_256"></span>[4](#fn_255)
hare; two are wild species, one dwelling in a burrow <span
id="fr_257"></span>[5](#fn_256) *and* one dwelling in the jungle. 21.
Eighth, eight species of weasel; one the marten, one the black marten,
the squirrel, the B*e*z ermine <span id="fr_258"></span>[6](#fn_257),
the white ermine, *and* other species of weasel. 22. Ninth, eight
species of musk *animals*; one is that which is recognised by *its*
musk <span id="fr_259"></span>[7](#fn_258), one

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

the musk *animal* with a bag in which is their pleasant scent, the
Bi*s*-musk <span id="fr_260"></span>[1](#fn_259) which eats the
Bi*s*-*herb*, the black musk which is the enemy of the serpent *that is*
numerous in rivers, *and* other species of musk *animals*. 23. Tenth,
one hundred and ten species of birds; flying creatures (vey = vâî) such
as the griffon bird <span id="fr_261"></span>[2](#fn_260), the
Kar*s*ipt <span id="fr_262"></span>[3](#fn_261), the eagle, the
Kahrkâs <span id="fr_263"></span>[4](#fn_262) which they call the
vulture, the crow, the Ardâ, the crane, *and* the tenth <span
id="fr_264"></span>[5](#fn_263) is the bat. 24. There are two of them
which have milk in the teat *and* suckle *their* young, the griffon bird
and the bat which flies in the night; as they say that the bat is
created of three races (sar*d*ak), the race (âyina) of the dog, the
bird, *and* the musk *animal*; for it flies like a bird, has many teeth
like a dog, *and* is dwelling in holes like a musk-rat. 25. These
hundred and ten species of birds are distributed into eight groups
(khadûînak), mostly as scattered about as when a man scatters seed,
*and* drops the seed in *his* fingers to the ground, large, middling,
*and* small. 26. Eleventh <span id="fr_265"></span>[6](#fn_264), fish
were created of ten

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

species; first, the fish Ari*z* <span id="fr_266"></span>[1](#fn_265),
the Arzuvâ, the Arzukâ, the Marzukâ, *and* other Avesta names <span
id="fr_267"></span>[2](#fn_266). 27. Afterwards, within each species,
species within species are created, so the total is two hundred and
eighty-two species <span id="fr_268"></span>[3](#fn_267).

28\. Of the dog they say that out of the star station, that is, *away*
from the direction of the constellation Haptôk-rîng, was given to him
further by a stage (yô*g*ist) <span id="fr_269"></span>[4](#fn_268) than
to men, on account of *his* protection of sheep, *and* as associating
with sheep *and* men; for this the dog is purposely adapted <span
id="fr_270"></span>[5](#fn_269), as three more kinds of advantage are
given to him than *to* man, *he has* his own boots, his own
clothing <span id="fr_271"></span>[6](#fn_270), *and* may wander about
without self-exertion. 29. The twelfth <span
id="fr_272"></span>[7](#fn_271) is the sharp-toothed beast of

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

which the leader of the flock is in such great fear, for that flock of
sheep is very badly maintained which has no dog.

30\. Aûharmazd said when the bird Vâresha <span
id="fr_273"></span>[1](#fn_272) was created by him, *which* is a bird of
prey, thus: 'Thou art created by me, O bird Vâresha! so that my vexation
may be greater than *my* satisfaction with thee, for thou doest the will
of the evil spirit more than that of me; like the wicked man who did not
become satiated with wealth, thou also dost not become satiated with the
slaughter of birds; but if thou be not created by me, O bird Vâresha!
thou wouldst be created by him, the evil spirit, *as* a kite <span
id="fr_274"></span>[2](#fn_273) with the body of a Varpa <span
id="fr_275"></span>[3](#fn_274), by which no creature would be left
alive.'

31\. Many animals are created in all these species for this reason, that
when one shall be perishing *through* the evil spirit, one shall remain.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_230"></span>[45:4](sbe0523.htm#fr_231) See Chaps. IV, 1,
and X, 1.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[45:5](sbe0523.htm#fr_232) All MSS. have
lakhvâr, 'again,' but this is probably a blunder for lâlâ, 'up.'

<span id="fn_232"></span>[45:6](sbe0523.htm#fr_233) K20 has 'fifteen'
here, but 'twelve' in Chaps. X, 1, and XXVII, 2.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[45:7](sbe0523.htm#fr_234) K20 has 'of every
single thing the lodgment is in the marrow.'

<span id="fn_234"></span>[46:1](sbe0523.htm#fr_235) Probably ka*d*ûk-i
raz may mean 'the pumpkin and grape.'

<span id="fn_235"></span>[46:2](sbe0523.htm#fr_236) Reading dîl; but the
word may also be read sar, 'the head,' or jigar, 'the liver.'

<span id="fn_236"></span>[46:3](sbe0523.htm#fr_237) See Chap. X, 2.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[46:4](sbe0523.htm#fr_238) This translation
suits both text and context very welt but gôspend pûr-sar*d*ak is
evidently intended for the Av. gâu*s* pouru-saredhô, 'the ox of many
species,' of Mâh Yt. 0, 7, and Sîrôz. 12.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[46:5](sbe0523.htm#fr_239) Reading mûn aê
parasang humânâk; if 3 be read for aê the translation must be, 'three of
which are like a Parasang,' for a Hâsar cannot be equal to three
Parasangs (see Chaps. XVI, 70 and XXVI). The phrase in the text probably
means merely that a Hâsar is a measure for long distances, just as a
Parasang is.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[47:1](sbe0523.htm#fr_240) Justi reads
gîrîsa*k*, the Av. gairishâ*k*ô, 'mountain-frequenting,' of Tî*s*tar Yt.
36; but this is doubtful.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[47:2](sbe0523.htm#fr_241) Pahl. zibâl = Pers.
zîbâl.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[47:3](sbe0523.htm#fr_242) The Paz. sin-i se
avinâ is the Pahl. sên-i 3 khadûînak of Chap. XXIV, II, 29, the Sîn bird
or Sîmurgh of Persian legends, the Av. saêna. The word avinâ is a Pâz.
misreading either of âînak, 'kind, sort,' or of an*g*anâk, 'dividing.'
The mixture of Pâzand and Pahlavi in this and some other chapters is
rather perplexing, but the Pâzand misreadings can usually be corrected
after transliterating them back into Pahlavi characters.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[47:4](sbe0523.htm#fr_243) Reading va taru
(Pers. tar).

<span id="fn_243"></span>[47:5](sbe0523.htm#fr_244) See Chaps. XVIII, 3,
and XXIV, 13.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[47:6](sbe0523.htm#fr_245) If this Pâzand word
be written in Pahlavi letters it may be read va magan, which may stand
for va magil, 'and the leech;', but this is very uncertain.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[48:1](sbe0523.htm#fr_246) K20 alone has 272
(see Chap. X. 3).

<span id="fn_246"></span>[48:2](sbe0523.htm#fr_247) The khar-bûz (see
Chap. XXIV, 2).

<span id="fn_247"></span>[48:3](sbe0523.htm#fr_248) Supposing se koh to
be a Pâz. misreading of Pahl. *s*ukûh. Justi's translation is: 'it
inhabits the three mountains, like the horse.'

<span id="fn_248"></span>[48:4](sbe0523.htm#fr_249) Pâz. ashgun is
evidently for Pahl. ha*s*gûn.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[48:5](sbe0523.htm#fr_250) Transcribing the
Pâz. mâhi khu ushân into Pahlavi it may be read mâhîkân-khvashân
(khashân?).

<span id="fn_250"></span>[48:6](sbe0523.htm#fr_251) Instead of these
first three species M6 has 'the white, black, yellow, bay, *and*
chestnut.' K20 omits 'the ass' by mistake.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[48:7](sbe0523.htm#fr_252) These first four
species are the Av. pasu*s*-haurvô, vi*s*-haurvô, vôhunazgô, and taurunô
of Vend. V, 92-98, XIII, 21, 26-74, 117, 164, 165.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[49:1](sbe0523.htm#fr_253) The Av. bawri*s*
upâpô of Âbân Yt. 129.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[49:2](sbe0523.htm#fr_254) The word indra has
usually been taken as a Pâz. misreading of the Pahl. aûdrak (Av. udra,
'otter,' of Vend. XIII, 48, 167, 169, XIV, 2), but this would be more
probably read andra. The Pahl. sûgar, 'porcupine,' is just as likely to
be misread indra, and its meaning suits the context better.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[49:3](sbe0523.htm#fr_255) The Paz.
âmokhte*s*n, which is an ungrammatical form, is evidently a misreading
of the Pahl. âmûkhtagân.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[49:4](sbe0523.htm#fr_256) K20 has seyâ, M6 has
zyâgi hest. Perhaps some old copyist has corrected siyâk-gôsh into
khar-gôsh, and so both the epithets have crept into the text, the word
'black' being superfluous.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[49:5](sbe0523.htm#fr_257) Reading
khan-mâni*s*t, the Pâz. khu being an obvious misreading of khan.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[49:6](sbe0523.htm#fr_258) The Pâz. b*e*z is
written bedh in the Pâzand MS. (the z in M6 being shaped something like
dh), and Justi supposes it represents the Arabic abyadh or baîdhâ,
'white,' and is explained by the Pers. sapêd, 'white,' which follows;
but there is nothing in the text to indicate that the second name is an
explanation of the first. It is more probable that b*e*z represents the
Pers. bî*g*âd, 'reddish, rufous, variegated,' an epithet quite
applicable to the ermine in its summer fur.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[49:7](sbe0523.htm#fr_259) Or, 'is known as the
musk *animal*.'

<span id="fn_259"></span>[50:1](sbe0523.htm#fr_260) A kind of musk-rat;
the bî*s* it eats is said to be the Napellus Moysis.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[50:2](sbe0523.htm#fr_261) Pahl. sênô mûrûk,
the sîmurgh of Persian tradition, and Av. mereghô saênô of Bahrâm Yt.
41.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[50:3](sbe0523.htm#fr_262) See Chap. XIX, 16.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[50:4](sbe0523.htm#fr_263) See Chap. XIX, 25.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[50:5](sbe0523.htm#fr_264) Counting the 'flying
creatures' and 'the vulture' as distinct species, 'the bat' is the
tenth. It has been generally supposed that we should read 'eleventh,'
and consider the bats as an eleventh group, especially as the MSS. call
the next group (the fish) the 'twelfth;' but this view is contradicted
by the remarks about the bats being mingled with those about the birds,
and also by Zâ*d*-sparam in his Selections, Chap. IX, 14 (see App. to
Bund.), not mentioning any group of bats among the other animals.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[50:6](sbe0523.htm#fr_265) All the MSS. have
'twelfth,' but they give no 'eleventh' nor 'thirteenth,' though they
have 'fourteenth' in § 29. These irregularities <span id="page_51">p.
51</span> seem to indicate that part of this chapter has been omitted by
some old copyist.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[51:1](sbe0523.htm#fr_266) See Chaps. XVIII, 5,
and XXIV, 13.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[51:2](sbe0523.htm#fr_267) None of these names
are found in the portion of the Avesta now extant.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[51:3](sbe0523.htm#fr_268) K20 alone has 272
(see Chap. X, 3). The actual total number of species mentioned is 186,
leaving ninety-six for the 'species within species.' Zâ*d*-sparam in his
Selections, Chap. IX, 14, differs from the numbers given in the text
merely in giving ten species of ox, instead of fifteen; so the total of
his details is 181, leaving 101 sub-species to make up his; grand total
of 282 (see App. to Bund.)

<span id="fn_268"></span>[51:4](sbe0523.htm#fr_269) A yô*g*ist (compare
Sans. yo*g*ana) was probably from fifteen to sixteen English miles, as
it consisted of sixteen hâsar, each of one thousand steps of the two
feet (see Chap. XXVI, 1). This sentence seems to imply that on account
of the useful qualities of the dog he has a part of the lowermost grade
of paradise allotted to him, further from the demon-haunted north than
that allotted to the men whose inferior order of merit does not entitle
them to enter the higher grades of paradise.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[51:5](sbe0523.htm#fr_270) Reading
âhang-hômand, 'having a purpose.'

<span id="fn_270"></span>[51:6](sbe0523.htm#fr_271) Compare Vend. XIII,
106.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[51:7](sbe0523.htm#fr_272) All the MSS. have
'fourteenth,' but they give no 'thirteenth.'

<span id="fn_272"></span>[52:1](sbe0523.htm#fr_273) No doubt 'a hawk'
(Pers. vâ*s*ah or bâ*s*ah), as mentioned by Justi; Av. vâre would become
vâ or bâ in Persian.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[52:2](sbe0523.htm#fr_274) Compare gûrîk with
Pers. varik, varkâ, varkâk, varkak, vargâh, 'an eagle, falcon, kite, or
hawk.'

<span id="fn_274"></span>[52:3](sbe0523.htm#fr_275) Transcribing the
Pâz. varpa êyi into Pahlavi we have varpak-aê, which is very nearly the
same in form as varî*k*ak-aê, 'a hut or cottage' (Pers. gurî*k*ah-ê); so
the formidable bird which the evil spirit might have created was 'a kite
with a body like a cottage.'
