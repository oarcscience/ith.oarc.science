### CHAPTER VII.

1\. The morning sun it is necessary to reverence (ya*s*tanŏ) till
midday, and that of midday it is necessary to reverence till the
afternoon time, and that of the afternoon time it is necessary to
reverence till night <span id="fr_1501"></span>[3](#fn_1490.md); whenever
*one* is quite prepared

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

for activity (khvê*s*kârîh), and shall then do reverence, it is proper.
2. And when anything of that happens which *indicates* when it is not
proper to wash the hands, and about this he considers that when he does
not reverence the sun it will stop <span
id="fr_1502"></span>[1](#fn_1491.md), *at* the time previous *to that* in
which it occurs the sun is to be fully reverenced by him, and,
afterwards, when *his* hands are washed, it is to be reverenced again;
and when he does not reverence *it*, except when innocent through not
reverencing *it* <span id="fr_1503"></span>[2](#fn_1492.md), then it
becomes irreverence (lâ ya*s*t) of the sun *for* him <span
id="fr_1504"></span>[3](#fn_1493.md).

3\. *As to* the sun it is better when *one* reverences *it* every time
at the proper period (pavan gâs-i naf*s*man); when he does not reverence
*it for* once *it* is a sin of thirty stîrs <span
id="fr_1505"></span>[4](#fn_1494.md). 4. Reverencing the sun is every time
a good work of one Tanâpûhar <span id="fr_1506"></span>[5](#fn_1495.md);
and *so* of the moon and fire *in* like manner <span
id="fr_1507"></span>[6](#fn_1496.md). 5. When on account of cloudiness the
sun is not visible (pê*d*âk), and *one* shall reverence *it*, it is
proper.

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

6\. And while *one* does not reverence the sun, the good works which
they do that day are not their own; some say that of the good works
which they do within the law (dâ*d*) of the good religion he has no
share. 7. While they do not wash dirty hands any good work which they do
is not their own, for while *one* does not utterly destroy corruption
(nasû*s*) <span id="fr_1508"></span>[1](#fn_1497.md) *there* is no coming
of the angels to his body, and when *there* is no coming of the angels
to his body he has no steadfastness in the religion, and when he has no
steadfastness in the religion no good work whatever reaches unto him.

8\. When *one* wishes to perform the propitiation (shnûman) <span
id="fr_1509"></span>[2](#fn_1498.md) of fire, it is allowable to perform
one 'âthrô' by itself, and, when two *and* the 'ma*d* vîspaêibyô
âterebyô,' these three are thus the propitiation everywhere <span
id="fr_1510"></span>[3](#fn_1499.md); some say that it would be proper to
perform *it* while allowable, except that of the heterodox.

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

9\. Whoever shall extinguish <span id="fr_1511"></span>[1](#fn_1500.md) a
fire, by him ten fires are to be gathered together, by him ten
punishments are to be endured, by him ten ants are to be destroyed <span
id="fr_1512"></span>[2](#fn_1501), and by him holy-water (zôhar.md) is to
be presented to the sacred fire (âtâ*s*-i Vâhrâm).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1490"></span>[297:3](sbe0567.htm#fr_1501.md) Referring to the
recitation of the Khûrshêd Nyâyi*s*, or 'salutation of the sun,' which
should be performed thrice a day, in the Hâvan, Rapîtvîn, and Aûzêrîn
Gâhs, or periods of the day (see <span id="page_298">p. 298</span> Bund.
XXV, 9); a few sentences in the Nyâyi*s*, or formula of salutation, are
altered to suit the particular Gâh in which it is recited.

<span id="fn_1491"></span>[298:1](sbe0567.htm#fr_1502.md) K20 has, 'it will
protect *it;*' having read netrûnê*d* instead of ketrûnê*d* in its
original. To pray with unwashed hands would be sinful (see Pahl. Vend.
XIX, 84).

<span id="fn_1492"></span>[298:2](sbe0567.htm#fr_1503.md) That is, except
when the omission is to avoid a worse evil, as in the instance just
mentioned.

<span id="fn_1493"></span>[298:3](sbe0567.htm#fr_1504.md) Or, perhaps, 'it
does not become a Khûrshê*d* Ya*s*t ("a formula of praise in honour of
the sun") *for* him.' This Ya*s*t forms a part of the Nyâyi*s*.

<span id="fn_1494"></span>[298:4](sbe0567.htm#fr_1505.md) That is, an
Aredû*s* sin (see Chap. I, 2). M6 has, 'when he does not reverence if
again.'

<span id="fn_1495"></span>[298:5](sbe0567.htm#fr_1506.md) That is, a good
work sufficient to counterbalance a Tanâpûhar sin, which puts the
performance of a Nyâyi*s* on the same footing as the consecration of 9,
sacred cake or drôn (see Chap. XVI, 6).

<span id="fn_1496"></span>[298:6](sbe0567.htm#fr_1507.md) The moon and fire
have each a separate Nyâyi*s*.

<span id="fn_1497"></span>[299:1](sbe0567.htm#fr_1508.md) That is, the
demon of corruption, who is supposed to enter and reside in all filth of
the nature of dead matter, until expelled or destroyed by cleansing.

<span id="fn_1498"></span>[299:2](sbe0567.htm#fr_1509.md) A shnûman or
khshnûmanŏ (Av. khshnûman) is a short formula of praise, reciting all
the usual titles of the spirit intended to be propitiated by it, and is
used for dedicating the prayers or ceremony specially to his service
(see Chaps. III, 35, X, 2, XIV, 3). The propitiatory formulas for the
thirty angels and archangels who preside over the days of the month
constitute the Sîrôzah, or form of prayer 'relating to the thirty days.'

<span id="fn_1499"></span>[299:3](sbe0567.htm#fr_1510.md) The propitiation
of fire (as given in Sîrôz. I, 9, Âtâ*s* Nyâyi*s* 5, 6) consists of five
sentences, each beginning with the word âthrô, 'of the fire,' and the
last sentence also contains the words ma*d* vîspaêibyô âterebyô, 'with
all fires.' The meaning of the text appears to be that it is allowable
to use only one of these sentences (probably the last), but if two are
used besides the fast they are amply sufficient for practical purposes.

<span id="fn_1500"></span>[300:1](sbe0567.htm#fr_1511.md) Literally,
'kill.'

<span id="fn_1501"></span>[300:2](sbe0567.htm#fr_1512.md) The ant being a
creature of the evil spirit, on account of its carrying away corn.
