### CHAPTER XI.

1\. On the nature of the earth it says in revelation, that *there* are
thirty and three kinds <span id="fr_153"></span>[3](#fn_153.md) of land. 2.
*On* the day when Tî*s*tar produced the rain, when its seas arose
therefrom, the whole place, half taken up by water, was converted into
seven portions; this portion <span id="fr_154"></span>[4](#fn_154.md), as
much as one-half, is the middle, *and* six portions are around; those
six portions are *together* as much as Khvanîras. 3. The name

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

kêshvar ('zone or region') is also applied to them, and *they* existed
side by side (kash kash) <span id="fr_155"></span>[1](#fn_155.md); as on
the east side of this portion (Khvanîras) is the Savah region, *on* the
west is the Arzah region; the two portions on the south side are the
Frada*d*afsh *and* Vîda*d*afsh regions, the two portions on the north
side are the Vôrûbar*s*t *and* Vôrû*g*ar*s*t regions, *and* that in the
middle is Khvanîras. 4. And Khvanîras has the sea, for one part of the
wide-formed ocean wound about around it; *and from* Vôrûbar*s*t *and*
Vôrû*g*ar*s*t a lofty mountain grew up; so that it is not possible for
any one to go from region to region <span
id="fr_156"></span>[2](#fn_156.md).

5\. And of these seven regions every benefit was created most in
Khvanîras, and the evil spirit also produced most for Khvanîras, on
account of the superiority (sarîh) <span id="fr_157"></span>[3](#fn_157.md)
which he saw in it. 6. For the Kayânians and heroes were created in
Khvanîras; and the good religion of the Mazdayasnians was created in
Khvanîras, and afterwards conveyed to the other regions; Sôshyans <span
id="fr_158"></span>[4](#fn_158.md) is born in Khvanîras, who makes the evil
spirit impotent, and causes the resurrection *and* future existence.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_153"></span>[32:3](sbe0520.htm#fr_153.md) K20b has 'thirty-two
kinds.'

<span id="fn_154"></span>[32:4](sbe0520.htm#fr_154.md) That is, Khvanîras;
or it may be 'one portion,' as hanâ, 'this,' is often used for aê,
'one,' because the Pâzand form of both words is *e*.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[33:1](sbe0520.htm#fr_155.md) Possibly an attempt
to connect the term kêshvar with kash; but the sentence may also be
translated thus: 'and *they* formed various districts like this portion;
on the east side is the Savah region,' &c.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[33:2](sbe0520.htm#fr_156.md) In the Pahlavi Vend.
I, 4a, and in the Mainyô-i-khar*d*, IX, 6, it is added, 'except with the
permission of the angels' or the demons.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[33:3](sbe0520.htm#fr_157.md) So in M6; but K20
has za*d*ârîh, which would imply, 'for the destruction of what he saw of
it.'

<span id="fn_158"></span>[33:4](sbe0520.htm#fr_158.md) Always spelt so in
the Bundahi*s* MSS. K20 and M6, and corrupted into Sôshyôs in Pâzand;
but it is more usually written Sôshâns in other Pahlavi works, and its
Avesta form is Saoshyãs (see Chap. XXXII, 8).
