### CHAPTER V.

1\. Seven chieftains of the planets have come unto the seven chieftains
of the constellations <span id="fr_104"></span>[2](#fn_104.md), as the
planet Mercury (Tîr) unto Tî*s*tar, the planet Mars (Vâhrâm) unto
Haptôk-rîng, the planet Jupiter (Aûharmazd) unto Vanand, the planet
Venus (Anâhî*d*) unto Satavês, the planet Saturn (Kêvân) unto the great
*one* of the middle of the sky, Gô*k*îhar <span
id="fr_105"></span>[3](#fn_105.md)

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

and the thievish (dû*g*gun) Mû*s*par <span
id="fr_106"></span>[1](#fn_106.md), provided with tails, unto the sun and
moon and stars. 2. The sun has attached Mû*s*par to its own radiance by
mutual agreement, so that he may be less able to do harm (vinâs).

3\. Of Mount Albûr*z* <span id="fr_107"></span>[2](#fn_107.md) it is
declared, that around the world and Mount Têrak <span
id="fr_108"></span>[3](#fn_108.md), which is the middle of the world, the
revolution of the sun is like a moat <span
id="fr_109"></span>[4](#fn_109.md) around the world; it turns back in a
circuit <span id="fr_110"></span>[5](#fn_110.md) owing to the enclosure
(var) of Mount Albûr*z* around Têrak. 4. As it is said that *it is* the
Têrak of Albûr*z* from behind which my sun and moon *and* stars return
again <span id="fr_111"></span>[6](#fn_111.md). 5. For there are a hundred

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

and eighty apertures (rô*g*în) in the east, and a hundred and eighty in
the west, through Albûr*z*; *and* the sun, every day, comes in through
an aperture, and goes out through an aperture <span
id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_112.md); *and* the whole connection and motion
of the moon and constellations and planets is with it: every day it
always illumines (or warms) three regions (kêshvar) <span
id="fr_113"></span>[2](#fn_113.md) *and* a half, as is evident to the
eyesight. 6. And twice in every year the day and night are equal, for on
the original attack <span id="fr_114"></span>[3](#fn_114.md), when <span
id="fr_115"></span>[4](#fn_115) it (the sun.md) went forth from its first
degree (khûr*d*ak), the day and night were equal, it was the season of
spring; when it arrives at the first degree of Kala*k*ang (Cancer) the
time of *day* is greatest, *it is* the beginning of summer; when it
arrives at the sign (khûr*d*ak) Tarâ*g*ûk (Libra) the day and night are
equal, *it is* the beginning of autumn; when it arrives at the sign
Vahîk (Capricorn) the night is a maximum, *it is* the beginning of
winter; and when it arrives at Varak (Aries) the night and day *have*
again become equal, as when it

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

went forth from Varak. 7. So that when it comes back to Varak, in three
hundred and sixty days and the five Gâtha days <span
id="fr_116"></span>[1](#fn_116.md), it goes in *and* comes out through one
and the same aperture; the aperture is not mentioned, for if it had been
mentioned the demons would have known the secret, and been able to
introduce disaster.

8\. From there where the sun comes on on the longest day to *where* it
comes on on the shortest day is the east region Savah; from there where
it comes on on the shortest day to *where* it goes off on the shortest
day is the direction of the south regions Frada*d*afsh and Vîda*d*afsh;
from there where it goes in on the shortest day to *where* it goes in on
the longest day is the west region Arzah; from there where it comes in
on the longest day to there where it goes in on the longest day are the
north regions Vôrûbar*s*t *and* Vôrû*g*ar*s*t <span
id="fr_117"></span>[2](#fn_117.md). 9. When the sun comes on, it illumines
(or warms) the regions of Savah, Frada*d*afsh, Vîda*d*afsh, and half of
Khvanîras <span id="fr_118"></span>[3](#fn_118.md); when it goes in on the
dark side, it illumines the regions of Arzah, Vôrûbar*s*t,
Vôrû*g*ar*s*t, *and* one half of Khvanîras; when *it is* day here *it
is* night there.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_104"></span>[21:2](sbe0514.htm#fr_104.md) Five of these are
mentioned in Chap. II, 7, 8, to which the sun and moon are here added.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[21:3](sbe0514.htm#fr_105.md) As this name stands
in the MSS. it may be read Gûr*g*dâr (as in the Pâz. MSS), Gûr*k*îhar,
or Dûr*k*îhar; the reading is very uncertain, and Windischmann suggests
Gûrg-*k*îhar, 'wolf progeny' (compare vehrkô-*k*ithra in Ardabahi*s*t
Ya*s*t 8). A shooting star, <span id="page_22">p. 22</span> or meteor,
is probably meant (see Chap. XXX, 18, 31), and as it is the special
disturber of the moon, it may be Gô-*k*îhar (Av. gao*k*ithra, of
ox-lineage'), a common epithet of the moon; the Pahlavi letter *k* being
often written something like the compound r*k*; and this supposition is
confirmed by the Gôk-*k*ihar of TD in Chap. XXVIII, 44.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[22:1](sbe0514.htm#fr_106.md) This is written
Mû*s*-parîk in TD in Chap. XXVIII, 44, and seems to be the mû*s* pairika
of Yas. XVII, 46, LXVII, 23, as noticed by Windischmann; it is probably
meant here for a comet, as it is attached to the sun. The zodiacal light
and milky way have too little of the wandering character of planets to
be considered planetary opponents of the sun and moon.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[22:2](sbe0514.htm#fr_107.md) The hara berezaiti,
'lofty mountain-range,' of the Avesta, which is an ideal representative
of the loftiest mountains known to the ancient Iranians, the Alburz
range in Mâzendarân, south of the Caspian. See Chaps. VIII, 2, XII, 1,
3.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[22:3](sbe0514.htm#fr_108.md) The Taêra of Yas.
XLI, 24, Râm Yt. 7, Zamyâd Yt. 6. See Chap. XII, 2, 4.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[22:4](sbe0514.htm#fr_109.md) The word mayâ-gîr is
a Huz. hybrid for âv-gîr, 'a water-holder, or ditch.'

<span id="fn_110"></span>[22:5](sbe0514.htm#fr_110.md) The word may be
either âvê*g*ak or khavî*g*ak, with this meaning.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[22:6](sbe0514.htm#fr_111.md) This appears to be a
quotation from the Rashnu Ya*s*t, 26. The Huz. word for 'month' is here
used for the 'moon.'

<span id="fn_112"></span>[23:1](sbe0514.htm#fr_112.md) This mode of
accounting for the varying position of sunrise and sunset resembles that
in the Book of Enoch, LXXI, but only six eastern and six western gates
of heaven are there mentioned, and the sun changes its gates of entrance
and exit only once a month, instead of daily.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[23:2](sbe0514.htm#fr_113.md) See § 9 and Chap.
XI.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[23:3](sbe0514.htm#fr_114.md) The reading of this
word is doubtful, although its meaning is tolerably clear. The Pâz. MSS.
read har dô, 'both;' Justi reads ardab, 'quarrel;' and in the Selections
of Zâ*d*-sparam it is written âr*d*îk. It seems probable that the word
is kharah, 'attack,' which being written exactly like ardê (Av. ashya,
see Yas. LVI, 1, 1) has had a circumflex added to indicate the supposed
d, and this false reading has led to the more modern form âr*d*îk (Pers.
ârd, 'anger'). But probabilities in obscure matters are often
treacherous guides.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[23:4](sbe0514.htm#fr_115.md) Reading amat,
'when,' instead of mûn, 'which,' throughout the sentence (see note to
Chap. I, 7).

<span id="fn_116"></span>[24:1](sbe0514.htm#fr_116.md) The five
supplementary days added to the last of the twelve months, of thirty
days each, to complete the year. For these days no additional apertures
are provided in Albûr*z*, and the sun appears to have the choice of
either of the two centre apertures out of the 180 on each side of the
world. This arrangement seems to indicate that the idea of the apertures
is older than the rectification of the calendar which added the five
Gâtha days to an original year of 360 days.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[24:2](sbe0514.htm#fr_117.md) This sentence
occurs, without the names of the kêshvars or regions, in the Pahl. Vend.
XIX, 19. For the kêshvars see Chap. XI.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[24:3](sbe0514.htm#fr_118.md) Often corrupted into
Khanîras in the MSS.
