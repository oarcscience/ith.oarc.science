### CHAPTER XXXI <span id="fr_727"></span>[1](#fn_722)

0\. On the race and genealogy of the Kayâns.

1\. Hôshyang <span id="fr_728"></span>[2](#fn_723) *was son* of Fravâk,
*son* of Sîyâkmak <span id="fr_729"></span>[3](#fn_724), *son* of Mâshya
 <span id="fr_730"></span>[4](#fn_725), *son* of Gâyômar*d*. \[2.
Takhmôrup <span id="fr_731"></span>[5](#fn_726) *was son* of
Vîvanghâû <span id="fr_732"></span>[6](#fn_727), *son* of
Yangha*d* <span id="fr_733"></span>[7](#fn_728), *son* of Hôshyang. 3.
Yim,\] <span id="fr_734"></span>[8](#fn_729) Takhmôrup, Spîtûr <span
id="fr_735"></span>[9](#fn_730), *and* Narsih <span
id="fr_736"></span>[10](#fn_731), whom they also call 'the Rashnû of
*K*înŏ <span id="fr_737"></span>[11](#fn_732),'

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

were all brothers 4. From Yim and Yimak <span
id="fr_738"></span>[1](#fn_733), who was *his* sister, was born a pair,
man *and* woman, and they became husband *and* wife together; Mîrak the
Âspiyân <span id="fr_739"></span>[2](#fn_734) and Zîyânak Zardâhim were
*their* names, *and* the lineage went on. 5. Spîtûr was he who, with
Dahâk, cut up Yim <span id="fr_740"></span>[3](#fn_735); 3; Narsih <span
id="fr_741"></span>[4](#fn_736) lived then <span
id="fr_742"></span>[5](#fn_737) also, *whom* they call Nêsr-gyâvân <span
id="fr_743"></span>[6](#fn_738); they say that such destiny (gadman) is
allotted to him <span id="fr_744"></span>[7](#fn_739), that he shall
pass every day in troubles, and shall make all food purified *and* pure.

6\. Dahâk <span id="fr_745"></span>[8](#fn_740) *was son* of Khrûtâsp,
*son* of Zâînîgâv,

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

*son* of Viraf*s*ang, *son* of Tâ*z*, *son* of Fravâk, *son* of
Sîyâkmak <span id="fr_746"></span>[1](#fn_741); by *his* mother Dahâk
*was* of Udaî <span id="fr_747"></span>[2](#fn_742), *son* of Bayak,
*son* of Tambayak, *son* of Owokhm <span
id="fr_748"></span>[3](#fn_743), *son* of Pairi-urvaêsm <span
id="fr_749"></span>[4](#fn_744), *son* of Gadhwithw <span
id="fr_750"></span>[5](#fn_745), *son* of Drû*g*âskân <span
id="fr_751"></span>[6](#fn_746), *son* of the evil spirit.

7\. Frê*d*ûn the Âspiyân <span id="fr_752"></span>[7](#fn_747) *was son
of* Pûr-tôrâ <span id="fr_753"></span>[8](#fn_748) the Âspiyân, *son* of
Sôk-tôrâ <span id="fr_754"></span>[9](#fn_749) the Âspiyân, *son* of
Bôr-tôrâ the Âspiyân, *son* of Sîyâk-tôrâ the Âspiyân, *son* of
Spê*d*-tôrâ the Âspiyân, *son* of Gefar-tôrâ the Âspiyân, *son* of
Ramak-tôrâ the Âspiyân, *son* of

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
Vanfraghe*s*n <span id="fr_755"></span>[1](#fn_750) the Âspiyân, *son*
of Yim, *son* of Vîvanghâû; as these, apart from the Âspiyân Pûr-tôrâ,
were ten generations, they every one lived a hundred years, which
becomes one thousand years; those thousand years were the evil reign of
Dahâk. 8. By the Âspiyân Pûr-tôrâ was begotten Frê*d*ûn, who exacted
vengeance for Yim; together *with him* <span
id="fr_756"></span>[2](#fn_751), also were the sons Barmâyûn *and*
Katâyûn, *but* Frê*d*ûn was fuller of glory than they.

9\. By Frê*d*ûn three sons were begotten, Salm and Tû*g* and
Aîrî*k* <span id="fr_757"></span>[3](#fn_752); and by Aîrî*k* one son
*and* one pair <span id="fr_758"></span>[4](#fn_753) were begotten; the
names of the couple of sons were Vânî*d*âr *and* Anastokh <span
id="fr_759"></span>[5](#fn_754), *and* the name of the daughter was
Gû*z*ak <span id="fr_760"></span>[6](#fn_755). 10. Salm *and* Tû*g* slew
*them* all, Aîrî*k* and *his* happy sons, *but* Frê*d*ûn kept the
daughter in concealment, *and* from that daughter a daughter was
born <span id="fr_761"></span>[7](#fn_756); they became aware *of it*,
and the mother was slain by them. 11. Frê*d*ûn provided for the
daughter <span id="fr_762"></span>[8](#fn_757), also in concealment, for

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

ten generations, when Mânû*s*-i Khûrshê*d*-vînîk was born from *his*
mother, \[*so called* because, as he was born, *some* of\] <span
id="fr_763"></span>[1](#fn_758) the light of the sun (khûrshê*d*) fell
upon *his* nose (vînîk). 12. From Mânû*s*-i Khûrshê*d*-vînîk *and his*
sister <span id="fr_764"></span>[2](#fn_759) was Mânû*s*-khûrnar, *and*
from Mânû*s*-khûrnar \[*and his* sister\] was Mânû*sk*îhar born <span
id="fr_765"></span>[3](#fn_760), by whom Salm and Tû*g* were slain in
revenge for Aîrî*k* <span id="fr_766"></span>[4](#fn_761). 13. By
Mânû*sk*îhar were Fri*s*, Nô*d*ar <span id="fr_767"></span>[5](#fn_762),
and Dûrâsrôb <span id="fr_768"></span>[6](#fn_763) begotten.

14\. Just as Mânû*sk*îhar *was of* Mânû*s*-khûrnar, of
Mânû*s*-khûrnâk <span id="fr_769"></span>[7](#fn_764), who was
Mâm-sozak <span id="fr_770"></span>[8](#fn_765), of Aîrak, of Thritak,
of Bîtak, of Frazû*s*ak, of Zû*s*ak <span
id="fr_771"></span>[9](#fn_766), of Fragûzak, of Gûzak, of Aîrî*k*, of
Frê*d*ûn, *so* Frâsîyâ*v* <span id="fr_772"></span>[10](#fn_767) *was*

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

of Pashang, of Zaê*s*m <span id="fr_773"></span>[1](#fn_768), of Tûrak,
of Spaênyasp, of Dûrôshasp, of Tû*g*, of Frê*d*ûn. 15. He (Frâsîyâ*v*)
as well as Karsêvaz <span id="fr_774"></span>[2](#fn_769), whom they
call Kadân <span id="fr_775"></span>[3](#fn_770), *and* Aghrêra*d* <span
id="fr_776"></span>[4](#fn_771) were all three brothers.

\[16 <span id="fr_777"></span>[5](#fn_772). Pashang and Vîsak were both
brothers. 17. By Vîsak were Pîrân <span id="fr_778"></span>[6](#fn_773),
Hûmân, *S*ân <span id="fr_779"></span>[7](#fn_774), and other brothers
begotten. 18. By Frâsîyâ*v* were Frasp-i Kûr, *S*ân, Shê*d*ak <span
id="fr_780"></span>[8](#fn_775), and other sons begotten; *and*
Vispân-fryâ <span id="fr_781"></span>[9](#fn_776), from whom Kaî-Khûsrôb
was born, was daughter of Frâsîyâ*v*, *and* was of the same mother with
Frasp-i Kûr. 19. From Frasp-i Kûr *were* Sûrâk, Asûrîk, and other
children; *and* by them were Khvâst-aîrikht, Yazdân-aîrikht,
Yazdân-*s*arâ*d*, Frêh-khûr*d*, Lâ-vahâk <span
id="fr_782"></span>[10](#fn_777), and others begotten, a recital of whom
*would* be tedious.

20\. By Aghrêra*d* *was* Gôpatshah <span
id="fr_783"></span>[11](#fn_778) begotten. 21. When Frâsîyâ*v* made
Mânû*sk*îhar, with the Iranians, captive in the mountain-range (gar) of

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Padashkh-vâr <span
id="fr_784"></span>[1](#fn_779), *and* scattered ruin *and* want among
them, Aghrêra*d* begged a favour of God (yazdân), and he obtained the
benefit that the army and champions of the Iranians were saved by him
from that distress. 22. Frâsîyâ*v* slew Aghrêra*d* for that fault; *and*
Aghrêra*d*, as his recompense, begat *such* a son as Gôpatshah.

23\. Aûzôbô the Tûhmâspian <span id="fr_785"></span>[2](#fn_780),
Kanak-i Barzi*s*t, Arawi*s*anasp, *and* Vaêta*nd*-i Râghinôi*d* *were*
the three sons *and* the daughter of Agâima*s*vâk <span
id="fr_786"></span>[3](#fn_781), the *son* of Nô*d*ar, *son* of
Mânû*sk*îhar, who begat Aûzôbô. 24. Kavâ*d* <span
id="fr_787"></span>[4](#fn_782) was a child in a waist-cloth (kuspû*d*)
they abandoned *him* on a river, *and* he froze upon the door-sills
(kavâ*d*akân); Aûzôbô perceived and took *him*, brought *him* up, *and*
settled the name of the trembling child.

25\. By Kavâ*d* *was* Kaî-Apîvêh begotten; by Kaî-Apîvêh *were*
Kaî-Arsh, Kaî-Vyârsh, Kaî-Pisân, and Kaî-Kâûs begotten; by Kaî-Kâûs
*was* Sîyâvakhsh begotten; by Sîyâvakhsh *was* Kaî-Khûsrôb <span
id="fr_788"></span>[5](#fn_783)

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

begotten. 26. Keresâsp <span id="fr_789"></span>[1](#fn_784) *and*
Aûrvakhsh <span id="fr_790"></span>[2](#fn_785) were both brothers. 27.
Athrat <span id="fr_791"></span>[3](#fn_786) *was son* of Sâhm, *son* of
Tûrak, *son* of Spaênyasp, *son* of Dûrôshasp <span
id="fr_792"></span>[4](#fn_787), *son* of Tû*g*, *son* of Frê*d*ûn. 28.
Lôharâsp <span id="fr_793"></span>[5](#fn_788) *was son* of Aûzâv <span
id="fr_794"></span>[6](#fn_789), *son* of Mânû*s*, *son of*
Kaî-Pîsîn <span id="fr_795"></span>[7](#fn_790), *son of* Kaî-Apîvêh,
*son of* Kaî-Kavâ*d*. 29. *By* Kaî-Lôharâsp were Vi*s*tâsp, Zarîr <span
id="fr_796"></span>[8](#fn_791), *and* other brothers begotten; by
Vi*s*tâsp were Spend-dâ*d* <span id="fr_797"></span>[9](#fn_792) and
Pêshyô-tanû <span id="fr_798"></span>[10](#fn_793) begotten; and by
Spend-dâ*d* were Vohûman <span id="fr_799"></span>[11](#fn_794),
Âtarô-tarsah, Mitrô-tarsah, *and* others begotten.

30\. Artakhshatar *descendant* of Pâpak—of whom his mother *was*
daughter—*was son* of Sâsân <span id="fr_800"></span>[12](#fn_795),
*son* of

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vêh-âfrî*d*
and <span id="fr_801"></span>[1](#fn_796) Zarîr, *son* of Sâsân, *son*
of Artakhshatar who *was* the said Vohûman *son* of Spend-dâ*d*.

31\. The mother of Kaî-Apîvêh was Farhank <span
id="fr_802"></span>[2](#fn_797), *daughter* of *him who is* exalted on
the *heavenly* path <span id="fr_803"></span>[3](#fn_798),
Urva*d*-gâi-frâ*s*t <span id="fr_804"></span>[4](#fn_799), *son* of Râk,
*son* of Dûrâsrôb, *son* of Mânû*sk*îhar. 32. This, too, it says, that
the glory <span id="fr_805"></span>[5](#fn_800) of Frê*d*ûn settled on
the root of a reed (kanyâ) in the wide-formed ocean; *and*
Nôktargâ <span id="fr_806"></span>[6](#fn_801), through sorcery, formed
a cow for tillage, *and* begat *children* there; three years he carried
the reeds there, *and* gave them to the cow, until the glory went on to
the cow; he brought the cow, milked *her* milk, *and* gave *it* to his
three sons; as *their* walking *was on* hoofs, the glory did not go to
the sons, but to Farhank. 33. Nôktargâ wished to injure <span
id="fr_807"></span>[7](#fn_802) Farhank, *but* Farhank went with the
glory *away* from

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

the fierce (tîb) father, and made a vow (patyastâk) thus: 'I will give
*my* first son to Aûshbâm <span id="fr_808"></span>[1](#fn_803).' 34.
Then Aûshbâm saved her from the father; and the first son, Kaî-Apîvêh,
she bore and gave to Aûshbâm, was a hero associating with Aûshbâm, and
travelled in Aûshbâm's company.

35\. The mother of Aûzôbô was the daughter of Nâmûn the wizard, when
Nâmak <span id="fr_809"></span>[2](#fn_804) was with Frâsîyâ*v*.

36\. And, moreover, together with those begotten by *S*âm <span
id="fr_810"></span>[3](#fn_805) were six children in pairs, male *and*
female; the name of one *was* Damnak, of one Khûsrôv, *and of one*
Mârgandak, *and* the name of *each* man and woman together was one. 37.
And the name of one *besides* them was Dastân <span
id="fr_811"></span>[4](#fn_806); he was considered more eminent than
they, and Sagânsîh <span id="fr_812"></span>[5](#fn_807) and the
southern quarter were given to him; and Avar-shatrô <span
id="fr_813"></span>[6](#fn_808) and the governorship were given by him
to Avarnak. 38. of Avar-shatrô this is said, that *it is* the district
of Avarnak, *and* they offered blessings *to* Srôsh and Ar*d*avahi*s*t
in succession; on this account is *their* possession of horses and
possession of arms; and on account of firm religion, purity, and
manifest joy, good estimation and extensive fame are greatly

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

among them. 39. To Damnak the governorship of Asûristân was given;
sovereignty and arranging the law of sovereignty, wilfulness and the
stubborn defects they would bring, were among them. 40. To Sparnak <span
id="fr_814"></span>[1](#fn_809) the governorship of Spâhân <span
id="fr_815"></span>[2](#fn_810) was given; to Khûsrôv the governorship
of Râi <span id="fr_816"></span>[3](#fn_811) was given; to Mârgandak the
kingdom, forest settlements, and mountain settlements of Padashkhvârgar
were given; *where* they travel nomadically, and *there are* the forming
of sheep-folds, prolificness, easy procreation, and continual triumph
over enemies. 41. From Dastân proceeded Rû*d*astâm <span
id="fr_817"></span>[4](#fn_812) and Hûzavârak <span
id="fr_818"></span>[5](#fn_813).\]

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_722"></span>[130:1](sbe0540.htm#fr_727) For this chapter,
which is numbered XXXII by previous translators, we have to depend only
on K20, TD, and K20b (a fragment evidently derived from the same
original as K20 and M6, but through some independent line of descent).

<span id="fn_723"></span>[130:2](sbe0540.htm#fr_728) So in K20, but
usually Hôshâng (see Chaps. XV, 28, XXXIV, 3, 4).

<span id="fn_724"></span>[130:3](sbe0540.htm#fr_729) See Chap. XV,
25,30.

<span id="fn_725"></span>[130:4](sbe0540.htm#fr_730) See Chaps. XV,
2-24, 30, XXXIV, 3.

<span id="fn_726"></span>[130:5](sbe0540.htm#fr_731) Av. Takhmô-urupa of
Râm Yt. 11, Zamyâd Yt. 28, Âfrîn Zarat. 2; written Tâkhmôrup in TD,
which is the only MS. in which the passage enclosed in brackets is
found, the omission of which by K20 was suspected by Windischmann
(Zoroastriche Studien, p. 199). This king is the Tahmûras of the
Shâhnâmah. See also Chaps. XVII, 4, XXXIV, 4.

<span id="fn_727"></span>[130:6](sbe0540.htm#fr_732) Av. Vîvan*g*h*a*u
of Yas. IX, 11, 20, XXXII, 8, Vend. II, 8, 28, 94, Fravardîn Yt. 130,
Zamyâd Yt. 35.

<span id="fn_728"></span>[130:7](sbe0540.htm#fr_733) As this Pâzand name
or title begins with a *medial* y, its initial vowel is probably omitted
(see p. 141, note 8).

<span id="fn_729"></span>[130:8](sbe0540.htm#fr_734) Av. Yima or Yima
khshaêta of Vend. II, &c., the Jamshêd of the Shâhnâmah (see Chaps.
XVII. 5, XXXIV, 4).

<span id="fn_730"></span>[130:9](sbe0540.htm#fr_735) Av. Spityura of
Zamyâd Yt. 46.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[130:10](sbe0540.htm#fr_736) Here written Nârsî
in K20, and K20b, and Nôsîh in TD; but see § 5 and Chap. XXIX, 6.
Windischmann suggests that he may be the Av. Aoshnara pouru-*g*îra of
Fravardîn Yt. 131, Âf. Zarat. 2.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[130:11](sbe0540.htm#fr_737) An epithet
equivalent to 'the Minos of China;' Rashnû being the angel of justice,
who is said to weigh the meritorious deeds of <span id="page_131">p.
131</span> the departed soul against its sins. Neither word is, however,
quite certain, as rashnûk may stand for rasnîk, 'spear,' and has also
been translated by 'light' and 'hero;' *K*înŏ, moreover, was probably
not China, but Samarkand (see Chaps. XII, 13, 22, XV, 29).

<span id="fn_733"></span>[131:1](sbe0540.htm#fr_738) See Chap. XXIII, 1.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[131:2](sbe0540.htm#fr_739) Av. Âthwyâna of
Âbân. Yt. 33, Gô*s* Yt. 13, Fravardîn Yt. 131, Zamyâd Yt. 36, &c., where
it is the family name of Thraêtaona, who is said to be a son of Âthwya
in Yas. IX, 23, 24. In the text this name seems to be used rather as a
title than a patronymic, and in § 7 it appears to be a family surname.

<span id="fn_735"></span>[131:3](sbe0540.htm#fr_740) As stated in Zamyâd
Yt. 46.

<span id="fn_736"></span>[131:4](sbe0540.htm#fr_741) Here written Nârsak
in K20 and K20b, and Nôsîh in TD.

<span id="fn_737"></span>[131:5](sbe0540.htm#fr_742) TD has 'together,'
instead of 'then.'

<span id="fn_738"></span>[131:6](sbe0540.htm#fr_743) So in K20, but K20b
has Narst-gyâvân, and TD has Nôsîh-vîyâvânîk (or nîyâzânîk). Perhaps we
may assume the epithet to have been nîgîr-vîyâvânîk (or nîyâzânîk), 'one
with a bewildering (or longing) glance.'

<span id="fn_739"></span>[131:7](sbe0540.htm#fr_744) Justi supposes this
clause of the sentence refers to Yim and the disease which attacked his
hand. If this be the case it may be translated as follows: 'they say
aîghash is produced on his hand (yadman), so that,' &c.; aîghash being a
disease, or evil, mentioned in Vend. XX, 14, 20, 24; compare Chap.
XXVIII, 33.

<span id="fn_740"></span>[131:8](sbe0540.htm#fr_745) Or A*z*-i Dahâk,
the Av. A*z*i Dahâka, 'destructive serpent,' of Yas. IX, 25, Vend. I,
69, Âbân Yt. 29, 34, Bahrâm Yt. 40, Zamyâd Yt. 46-50. A name applied to
a foreign dynasty (probably Semitic) personified as a single king, which
conquered the dominions of Yim (see Chap. XXXIV, 5).

<span id="fn_741"></span>[132:1](sbe0540.htm#fr_746) For the last three
names, see Chap. XV, 25, 28.

<span id="fn_742"></span>[132:2](sbe0540.htm#fr_747) Pahl. Aû*d* in TD;
compare 'the demon Uda' of Chap. XXVIII, 19. The following two names
look like 'fear' and 'gloom-fear,' both appropriate names for demons.

<span id="fn_743"></span>[132:3](sbe0540.htm#fr_748) TD has Pâz. Owôikh;
compare Av. aoiwra, 'a species of nightmare,' observing that r and ô are
often written alike in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_744"></span>[132:4](sbe0540.htm#fr_749) TD and K20b have
Paz. Pairi-urva-urvaêsm, and K20 has Pai-urvaêsm.

<span id="fn_745"></span>[132:5](sbe0540.htm#fr_750) TD has Pâz.
Gawithw.

<span id="fn_746"></span>[132:6](sbe0540.htm#fr_751) So in TD, but K20
has Pâz. Dru*z*-i ayaskâ, and K20b has Dru*g*-i ayaskâ. It corresponds
to Av. dru*g*aska in Vend. XIX, 139, Vi*s*tâsp Yt. 26. This genealogy
appears to trace Dahâk's maternal descent through a series of demons.

<span id="fn_747"></span>[132:7](sbe0540.htm#fr_752) Av. Thraêtaona, son
of Âthwya, but generally called 'the Âthwyânian,' who slew the
destructive serpent (a*z*i dahâka), see Yas. IX, 24, 25, Vend. I, 69,
Âbân Yt. 33, 61, Gô*s* Yt. 13, Fravardîn Yt. 131, Bahrâm Yt. 40, Râm Yt.
23, Ashi Yt. 33, Zamyâd Yt. 36, 92, Âf. Zarat. 2. In the Shâhnâmah he is
called Ferîdûn son of Abtîn.

<span id="fn_748"></span>[132:8](sbe0540.htm#fr_753) This name is
omitted in K20, but occurs in the other two MSS.; it is a Huzvâri*s*
hybrid equivalent to Pâz. Pûr-g*a*u and Av. Pouru-g*a*u which is. a
title of an Âthwyânian in Âf. Zarat. 4, Vi*s*tâsp Yt. 2. This genealogy
consists almost entirely of such hybrid names, which have a very
artificial appearance, though suitable enough for a race of herdsmen,
meaning, as they severally do, 'one with abundant oxen, with useful
oxen, with the brown ox, with the black ox, with the white ox, with the
fat ox, and with a herd of oxen.'

<span id="fn_749"></span>[132:9](sbe0540.htm#fr_754) So in TD, but the
other two MSS. have Sîyâk-tôrâ, which is probably wrong, as the same
name occurs again in this genealogy.

<span id="fn_750"></span>[133:1](sbe0540.htm#fr_755) In TD this name can
be read Vanfrôki*s*n or Vanfrôkgân.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[133:2](sbe0540.htm#fr_756) TD has 'as well as
*him*.' K20b omits most of this sentence by mistake.

<span id="fn_752"></span>[133:3](sbe0540.htm#fr_757) These sons, as
Windischmann observes, are not mentioned in the extant Avesta, but their
Avesta names, Sairima, Tûirya or Tûra, and Airya or Airyu, may be
gathered from the names of the countries over which they are supposed to
have ruled (see Fravardîn Yt. 143).

<span id="fn_753"></span>[133:4](sbe0540.htm#fr_758) TD has 'two sons
*and* one daughter.'

<span id="fn_754"></span>[133:5](sbe0540.htm#fr_759) TD has Anî*d*âr and
Anastabŏ.

<span id="fn_755"></span>[133:6](sbe0540.htm#fr_760) Or Gû*g*ak, in TD;
the other MSS. have Pâz. Gan*g*a here, but Guzak in § 14; it is
identical with the name of Hôshyang's sister and wife in Chap. XV, 28.
in the Pâzand *G*âmâsp-nâmah the name of Frê*d*ûn's daughter is written
Vîrak.

<span id="fn_756"></span>[133:7](sbe0540.htm#fr_761) Reading min zak
dûkht dûkht-i zâ*d*, as in K20b and TD; some uncertainty arises here
from the words dûkht, 'daughter,' and dvâ*d*, 'pair,' being written
alike in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_757"></span>[133:8](sbe0540.htm#fr_762) TD has bartman,
'daughter,' indicating that the word in K20 must be read dûkht, and not
dvâ*d*, 'pair.'

<span id="fn_758"></span>[134:1](sbe0540.htm#fr_763) The phrase in
brackets occurs only in TD; and the whole passage from 'vînîk' to 'sun'
is omitted in K20, evidently by mistake.

<span id="fn_759"></span>[134:2](sbe0540.htm#fr_764) TD has 'from
Manû*s* and *his* sister,' and K20b 'has from Mânû*s*-hû*k*îhar *and*
Mânû*s*-khûrshêd.'

<span id="fn_760"></span>[134:3](sbe0540.htm#fr_765) The words in
brackets occur only in TD, and K20b has 'from Mânû*s*-khûrnar also was
Mânû*s*-khûrnâk, *from* Mânû*s*-khûrnâk was Mânû*sk*îhar born,' but this
introduction of an extra generation is not confirmed by the list of
names in § 14. The term khûrnâk (or khûrnak) seems to be merely a
transcript of the Avesta word of which khûrshê*d*-vînîk, 'sun-nose,' is
a translation. The other term khûrnar can also be read khûrvar, but K20
has Pâz. *hv*arnar. Mânû*sk*îhar is the Av. Manus*k*ithra of Fravardîn
Yt. 131, where he is styled the Airyavan, or descendant of Airyu
(Aîrî*k*).

<span id="fn_761"></span>[134:4](sbe0540.htm#fr_766) TD has '*and*
vengeance exacted for Aîrî*k*.'

<span id="fn_762"></span>[134:5](sbe0540.htm#fr_767) See Chap. XXIX, 6.

<span id="fn_763"></span>[134:6](sbe0540.htm#fr_768) Pâz. Durâsro, but
the Pahlavi form, given in the text, occurs in § 31 and Chap. XXXII, 1
in TD, which MS. omits this § by mistake.

<span id="fn_764"></span>[134:7](sbe0540.htm#fr_769) The same as
Mânû*s*-i khûrshê*d*-vînîk, as noted above.

<span id="fn_765"></span>[134:8](sbe0540.htm#fr_770) This Pâzand epithet
seems to mean 'mother-burning,' and may have some connection with the
legend mentioned in § 11. TD has mûn am Gû*g*ak, 'whose mother was
Gû*g*ak.'

<span id="fn_766"></span>[134:9](sbe0540.htm#fr_771) K20b omits the five
names from Aîrak to Zû*s*ak.

<span id="fn_767"></span>[134:10](sbe0540.htm#fr_772) Av. Frangrasyan,
the Tûryan, of Yas. XI, 21, Âbân Yt. 41, <span id="page_135">p.
135</span> Gô*s* Yt. 18, 22, Ashi Yt. 38, 42, Zamyâd Yt. 56-63, 62, 93;
called Afrâsiyâb in the Shâhnâmah.

<span id="fn_768"></span>[135:1](sbe0540.htm#fr_773) Zâd*s*am in the
Shâhnâmah.

<span id="fn_769"></span>[135:2](sbe0540.htm#fr_774) Garsîvaz in the
Shâhnâmah.

<span id="fn_770"></span>[135:3](sbe0540.htm#fr_775) TD has Pahl.
Kî*d*ân.

<span id="fn_771"></span>[135:4](sbe0540.htm#fr_776) See Chap. XXIX, 5.

<span id="fn_772"></span>[135:5](sbe0540.htm#fr_777) The remainder of
this chapter is found only in TD.

<span id="fn_773"></span>[135:6](sbe0540.htm#fr_778) Pîrân Vîsah is
Afrâsiyâb's chief general in the Shâhnâmah and Hûmân and Pîlsam are his
brothers.

<span id="fn_774"></span>[135:7](sbe0540.htm#fr_779) This name is very
ambiguous in Pahlavi, as it can be read many other ways.

<span id="fn_775"></span>[135:8](sbe0540.htm#fr_780) Shêdah in the
Shâhnâmah.

<span id="fn_776"></span>[135:9](sbe0540.htm#fr_781) She is called
Farangîs in the Shâhnâmah.

<span id="fn_777"></span>[135:10](sbe0540.htm#fr_782) The reading of
several of these names is more or less uncertain, but the object of the
author is evidently to apply opprobrious epithets to all the male
descendants of Afrâsiyâb.

<span id="fn_778"></span>[135:11](sbe0540.htm#fr_783) TD has Gôpat-malkâ
here, as also in Chap. XXIX, 5, where it is said to be a title of
Aghrêra*d* (always written Agrêra*d* in TD).

<span id="fn_779"></span>[136:1](sbe0540.htm#fr_784) The mountains south
of the Caspian (see Chap. XII. 17).

<span id="fn_780"></span>[136:2](sbe0540.htm#fr_785) Av. Uzava Tûmâspana
of Fravardîn Yt. 131, called Zav, or Zâb, son of Tahmâsp, in the
Shâhnâmah.

<span id="fn_781"></span>[136:3](sbe0540.htm#fr_786) None of these
names, which TD gives in Pâzand, are to be found in the portion of the
Avesta yet extant.

<span id="fn_782"></span>[136:4](sbe0540.htm#fr_787) Av. Kavi Kavâta of
Fravardîn Yt. 132, Zamyâd Yt. 71, called Kaî-Qubâd in the Shâhnâmah.
There appears to be an attempt, in the text, to derive his name from the
'door-sill' on which he is said to have been found.

<span id="fn_783"></span>[136:5](sbe0540.htm#fr_788) The Avesta names of
these seven other Kayâns are, respectively, Kavi Aipi-vanghu, Kavi
Arshan, Kavi Byârshân, Kavi Pisanangh, Kavi Usadhan, Kavi Syâvarshân,
and Kavi Husravangh (see Fravardîn Yt. 132, Zamyâd Yt. 71, 74); omitting
the third, they are called, respectively, Armîn, Ari*s*, Pa*s*în,
Kaî-Kâvûs, Siyâvush, and Kaî-Khusrô in the Shâhnâmah. TD, omitting the
first letter, has Sânŏ for Pisân; it also writes Kaî-Kâyûks and
Kei-Khûsrôvî.

<span id="fn_784"></span>[137:1](sbe0540.htm#fr_789) Av. Keresâspa of
Yas. IX, 31, 36, 39, Vend. I, 36, Âbân Yt. 37, Fravardîn Yt. 61, 136,
Râm Yt. 27, Zamyâd Yt. 38-44, Âf. Zarat. 3; he is called Gar*s*âsp in
the Shâhnâmah.

<span id="fn_785"></span>[137:2](sbe0540.htm#fr_790) Av. Urvâkhshaya of
Yas. IX, 31, Râm Yt. 28, Âf. Zarat. 3. These brothers were sons of
Thrita or Athrat, mentioned in the next §.

<span id="fn_786"></span>[137:3](sbe0540.htm#fr_791) Av. Thrita of the
Sâma race (see Yas. IX, 30, Vend. XX, 11) and father of Keresâspa, whose
genealogy is given in a passage interpolated in some copies of the
Shâhnâmah as follows: Gar*s*âsp, Atrat, *S*am, Tûrag, *S*îdasb, Tûr,
Jamshêd.

<span id="fn_787"></span>[137:4](sbe0540.htm#fr_792) Written Dûrôshap in
TD, both here and in § 14.

<span id="fn_788"></span>[137:5](sbe0540.htm#fr_793) Av. Aurva*d*-aspa
of Âbân Yt. 105, Vi*s*tâsp Yt. 34, 46, called Luhrâsp in the Shâhnâmah.

<span id="fn_789"></span>[137:6](sbe0540.htm#fr_794) Reading doubtful.

<span id="fn_790"></span>[137:7](sbe0540.htm#fr_795) Written Ka-Pîsîn
here, but he is the same person as Kaî-Pisân of § 25; the latter part of
the name is written both Pisanangh and Pisina in the Avesta.

<span id="fn_791"></span>[137:8](sbe0540.htm#fr_796) Probably Zargar
(being Av. Zairivairi of Âbân Yt. 112, 117, Fravardîn Yt. 101), but
called Zarîr in the Shâhnâmah.

<span id="fn_792"></span>[137:9](sbe0540.htm#fr_797) Av. Spe*n*tô-dâta
of Fravardîn Yt. 103. Vi*s*tâsp Yt. 25, called Isfendiyâr in the
Shâhnâmah.

<span id="fn_793"></span>[137:10](sbe0540.htm#fr_798) See Chaps. XXIX,
5, XXXII, 5.

<span id="fn_794"></span>[137:11](sbe0540.htm#fr_799) Called Bahman in
the Shâhnâmah, and Ar*d*ashîr the Kayânian in Bahman Yt. II, 17; the
successor of his grandfather Vi*s*tâsp (see Chap. XXXIV, 8).

<span id="fn_795"></span>[137:12](sbe0540.htm#fr_800) The text is rather
obscure, but the Kârnâmak of Ar*d*ashîr-i Pâpakân states clearly that
Ar*d*ashîr was son of Sâsân by the <span id="page_138">p. 138</span>
daughter of Pâpak, a tributary ruler of Pârs under Ardavân, the last of
the A*s*kâniyân monarchs.

<span id="fn_796"></span>[138:1](sbe0540.htm#fr_801) So in the Pahlavi
text, which therefore makes Vêh-âfrî*d* a woman's name (like Pers.
Beh-âfrîn); but this is doubtful, as the MSS. often confound va, 'and,'
and i, '*son* of.'

<span id="fn_797"></span>[138:2](sbe0540.htm#fr_802) In the Shâhnâmah
Farhang is mother of Kaî-Kâvûs. The Pahlavi name can also be read
Farânak, the name of the mother of Ferîdûn in the Shâhnâmah.

<span id="fn_798"></span>[138:3](sbe0540.htm#fr_803) Pâz.
vîdharg-âfrâr*s*taka, which looks more like an epithet than a name.

<span id="fn_799"></span>[138:4](sbe0540.htm#fr_804) Or, perhaps,
'Urva*d*-gâ *son* of Frâ*s*t.'

<span id="fn_800"></span>[138:5](sbe0540.htm#fr_805) The divine glory
which was supposed to accompany all legitimate sovereigns of Iran, from
the time of Hôshyang even to that of the Sasanian dynasty; it is the Av.
*hv*arenangh of the Zamyâd Ya*s*t, and is said to have fled to the ocean
for refuge during the reign of foreign dynasties and wicked kings (see
Âbân Yt. 42, Zamyâd Yt. 51, 56, 59, 62).

<span id="fn_801"></span>[138:6](sbe0540.htm#fr_806) The last syllable
is so written, in Pâzand, in § 33.

<span id="fn_802"></span>[138:7](sbe0540.htm#fr_807) Reading
han*g*î*d*anŏ, to injure,' instead of khun*gd*anŏ, which may mean 'to
embrace;' the difference between the two words being merely the letter
î.

<span id="fn_803"></span>[139:1](sbe0540.htm#fr_808) This name means
'the dawn;' perhaps it may be identified with Av. Usinemangh or
Usenemangh of Fravardîn Yt. 113, 1401 whose wife Fr*e*ni may possibly be
the Farhank (or Frânak) of the text.

<span id="fn_804"></span>[139:2](sbe0540.htm#fr_809) So in TD, but it is
probably only a variant of Nâmûn.

<span id="fn_805"></span>[139:3](sbe0540.htm#fr_810) The grandfather of
Rustam (see § 41). In the Avesta he is usually called Sâma Keresâspa
with the title Nairiman*a*u; while in the Shâhnâmah *S*âm is son of
Narîmân.

<span id="fn_806"></span>[139:4](sbe0540.htm#fr_811) Another name for
Zâl, the father of Rustam, in the Shâhnâmah.

<span id="fn_807"></span>[139:5](sbe0540.htm#fr_812) The same as
Sagastân.

<span id="fn_808"></span>[139:6](sbe0540.htm#fr_813) Or, perhaps, 'the
upper district.'

<span id="fn_809"></span>[140:1](sbe0540.htm#fr_814) He would seem not
to have been a son of Sâm, as he is not mentioned before. The reading of
all these names is uncertain.

<span id="fn_810"></span>[140:2](sbe0540.htm#fr_815) The Pahlavi form of
Ispahân.

<span id="fn_811"></span>[140:3](sbe0540.htm#fr_816) Av. Ragha of Yas.
XIX, 51, Vend. I, 60, whose ruins are near the modern Teherân.

<span id="fn_812"></span>[140:4](sbe0540.htm#fr_817) The usual Pahlavi
form of Rustam.

<span id="fn_813"></span>[140:5](sbe0540.htm#fr_818) Or Aûzvârak;
Rustam's brother is called Zavârah in the Shâhnâmah.
