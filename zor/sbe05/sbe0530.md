### CHAPTER XXI <span id="fr_444"></span>[1](#fn_441).

1\. In revelation they mention seventeen <span
id="fr_445"></span>[2](#fn_442) species of liquid (mâyâ), as one liquid
resides in plants  <span id="fr_446"></span>[3](#fn_443); second, that
which is flowing from the mountains, that is, the rivers; third, that
which is rain-water; fourth, that of tanks *and* other special
*constructions*; fifth, the semen of animals and men; sixth, the urine
of animals and men <span id="fr_447"></span>[4](#fn_444); seventh, the
sweat of animals and men; the eighth liquid is that in the skin of
animals and men; ninth, the tears of animals and men; tenth, the blood
of animals and men; eleventh, the oil in animals and men, a necessary in
both worlds <span id="fr_448"></span>[5](#fn_445); twelfth, the saliva
of animals and men, with which they nourish the embryo <span
id="fr_449"></span>[6](#fn_446); the thirteenth is that which is under
the bark <span id="fr_450"></span>[7](#fn_447) of plants, as it is said
that every bark has a liquid, through which a drop *appears* on a twig
(têkh) *when placed* four finger-breadths before a fire <span
id="fr_451"></span>[8](#fn_448); fourteenth, the milk of animals and
men. 2. All these, through growth, or

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

the body which is formed, mingle again with the rivers, for the body
which is formed *and* the growth are both one.

3\. This, too, they say, that of these three rivers, that is, the Arag
river, the Marv river, *and* the Vêh <span
id="fr_452"></span>[1](#fn_449) river, the spirits were dissatisfied, so
that they would not flow into the world, owing to the defilement of
stagnant water (armê*s*t) which they beheld, so that they were in
tribulation through it until Zaratû*s*t was exhibited to them, whom I
(Aûharmazd) will create, who *will* pour sixfold holy-water (zôr) into
it *and* make *it* again wholesome; he will preach carefulness <span
id="fr_453"></span>[2](#fn_450). 4. This, too, it says, that, of water
whose holy-water is more and pollution less, the holy-water has come in
excess, *and* in three years it goes back to the sources <span
id="fr_454"></span>[3](#fn_451); *that* of which the pollution *and*
holy-water have both become equal, arrives back in six years; *that* of
which the pollution is more and holy-water less, arrives back in nine
years. 5. So, also, the growth of plants is connected, in this manner,
strongly with the root <span id="fr_455"></span>[4](#fn_452); so,
likewise, the blessings (âfrîn) which the righteous utter, come back, in
this proportion, to themselves.

6\. Regarding the river Nâhvtâk <span id="fr_456"></span>[5](#fn_453) it
says, that Frâsîyâ*v* of Tûr conducted it away; *and* when <span
id="fr_457"></span>[6](#fn_454)

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hûshê*d*ar <span
id="fr_458"></span>[1](#fn_455) comes it *will* flow again suitable for
horses; so, also, *will* the fountains of the sea Kyânsîh <span
id="fr_459"></span>[2](#fn_456). 7. Kyânsîh <span
id="fr_460"></span>[2](#fn_456) is the one where the home (*g*inâk) of
the Kayân race is.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_441"></span>[83:1](sbe0530.htm#fr_444) This chapter is
evidently a continuation of the preceding one.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[83:2](sbe0530.htm#fr_445) Only fourteen are
mentioned in the details which follow.

<span id="fn_443"></span>[83:3](sbe0530.htm#fr_446) Most of these
details are derived from the Pahl. Yas. XXXVIII, 7-9, 13, 14; and
several varieties of water are also in Yas. LXVII, 15.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[83:4](sbe0530.htm#fr_447) This sixth liquid is
omitted by K20.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[83:5](sbe0530.htm#fr_448) Departed souls are
said to be fed with oil in paradise.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[83:6](sbe0530.htm#fr_449) K20 omits the word
pûs, 'embryo.'

<span id="fn_447"></span>[83:7](sbe0530.htm#fr_450) The meaning 'bark'
for Pâz. ayvan is merely a guess; Anquetil has 'sap' (compare Pers.
âvînâ, 'juice'), but this is hardly consistent with the rest of the
sentence.

<span id="fn_448"></span>[83:8](sbe0530.htm#fr_451) See Chap. XXVII, 25.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[84:1](sbe0530.htm#fr_452) K20 has 'Hêlmand,'
but M6 has '*S*apîr,' the Huz. equivalent of 'Vêh,' which is more
probable.

<span id="fn_450"></span>[84:2](sbe0530.htm#fr_453) Or, 'abstinence
*from impurity*.'

<span id="fn_451"></span>[84:3](sbe0530.htm#fr_454) The source
Arêdvîvsûr (see Chap. XIII, 3, 10).

<span id="fn_452"></span>[84:4](sbe0530.htm#fr_455) That is, by the sap
circulating like the waters of the earth. The greater part of this
sentence is omitted in K20.

<span id="fn_453"></span>[84:5](sbe0530.htm#fr_456) Probably 'the
Nâvadâ' and 'navigable waters' of Chap. XX, 7, 34, and Nâîvtâk of Chap.
XXIX, 4, 5.

<span id="fn_454"></span>[84:6](sbe0530.htm#fr_457) Reading amat,
'when,' instead of mûn, 'which' (see note to Chap. I, 7).

<span id="fn_455"></span>[85:1](sbe0530.htm#fr_458) Written
Khûrshê*d*ar, as usual in Bundahi*s* (see Chap. XXXII, 8).

<span id="fn_456"></span>[85:2](sbe0530.htm#fr_460) Written Kayâseh in
Pâzand (see Chap. XIII, 16).
