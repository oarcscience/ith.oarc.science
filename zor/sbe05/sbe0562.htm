A built bridge is <I>liable</I> just like a terrace roof. 21. When <I>one</I> shall die on the terrace roof of a trellised <I>apartment</I> (varam), that is also <I>liable</I> just like a terrace roof. 22.

When he shall die on a branch of a tree which is green, when <I>there</I> is no fear of his falling off they should not carry <I>him</I> down. 28. And when <I>there</I> is fear of it, or <I>it is</I> a branch of a withered tree, when also, a hair originating with him, or a limb, remains behind on the particular tree, they should carry down the whole of the body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1280"></A><A HREF="#fn_1273"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 29.

<P><A NAME="fn_1248"></A><A HREF="sbe0562.htm#fr_1255">246:6</A> This sentence is probably defective, as the last clause evidently refers to the dog's gaze (see Pahl. Vend. III, 138), and not to the bird's shadow; the rule, however, is applicable to both. Thus the Persian Riv&acirc;yats state that if the bird's shadow falls upon the hair or the nails of the corpse, or if the bird's shadow, or the dog's gaze falls upon a corpse in the water, or upon its reflection in a mirror, the Nas&ucirc;<I>s</I> is not destroyed. Dast&ucirc;r J&acirc;m&acirc;spji is of opinion that the utility of the bird's shadow is intended to apply only to cases of death in uninhabited places, where a dog is not procurable. As all three birds are such as feed upon corpses, it seems probable that the rule as to their utility was intended to prevent <A NAME="page_247"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 247</FONT></A> any neglect of corpses found in wild places, where some of these birds would be sure to approach and let their shadows fall upon the dead. after which the finder of the corpse would suppose that the Nas&ucirc;<I>s</I> was destroyed or driven away, and the corpse safer to approach.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1249"></A><A HREF="sbe0562.htm#fr_1256">247:1</A> This is an exceptional case, when not more than two men are available; the usual custom (see Chap. X, 10) is to employ four men and two dogs (double the usual number) in disposing of the corpse of a pregnant woman, on account of the double risk of contamination, owing to the Nas&ucirc;<I>s</I>, or fiend of corruption, having seized upon two corpses at once. In consequence of the exceptional nature of the case, the mode of purification is also exceptional.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1250"></A><A HREF="sbe0562.htm#fr_1257">247:2</A> A long purification ceremony lasting nine nights, and described in Vend. IX, 1-145. Its name, according to Dast&ucirc;r Hoshangji, is derived from the first word of the instructions for sprinkling the unclean person, which commence (Vend. IX, 48) as follows: Bareshn&ucirc;m h&ecirc; vaghdhanem paourum paiti-hi<I>n</I><I>k</I>&ocirc;i<I>s</I>, 'sprinkle in, front on the top of his head.' As it is usual to quote chapters by their initial words, the initial word of these instructions for the ceremony became a name for the ceremony itself.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1251"></A><A HREF="sbe0562.htm#fr_1258">247:3</A> The building in which the dead are finally deposited; here called by its Huzv&acirc;ri<I>s</I> name, khaz&acirc;n. The Dakhmas used by the Parsis in India are like low circular towers in external appearance, and consist of a high wall enclosing a larger or smaller circular space which is open to the sky. The only opening in the wall is a small doorway, closed with an iron door. In the centre of the circular area is a circular well a few feet in depth, and the space around it is paved so as to slope gently downwards from the enclosing wall to the brink of the well. This paved annular area is divided (by shallow gutters grooved into its surface) into spaces, each large enough for one corpse to be laid, upon it, with the head towards the wall and the feet towards the well. These spaces are arranged in two or more concentric rings around the well, and the gutters (which isolate each space on all four sides) drain into the <A NAME="page_248"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 248</FONT></A> well. After a sufficient time has elapsed the dry bones are said to be thrown into the well, and when the well is full the Dakhma ought to be finally closed, and another one brought into use. These Dakhmas are erected upon some dry and barren spot, remote from habitations and water; upon the summit of a hill, if possible, as prescribed in Vend. VI, 93, and usually more than a mile from the town. In Bombay the town has gradually approached the Dakhmas, and to some extent surrounded them, but has been kept away from their immediate vicinity by the judicious measures of influential Parsis, who have acquired all the neighbouring land, and refrain from building on it. The reason for thus exposing their dead to the sun and carnivorous birds is that the Parsis consider fire, water, and earth too sacred to be defiled by corpses; and they have less consideration for the air. Next to burning, the Parsi mode of disposing of the dead is the most rapid and effectual, as it avoids most of the concentrated evils which must accumulate in crowded cemeteries in the course of time, and which require ages to dissipate. As it is, most of the offensive effluvium in the immediate vicinity of a Dakhma arises not from direct contamination of the air, but indirectly through the ground, which becomes polluted, in the course of time, by impure filtrations.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1252"></A><A HREF="sbe0562.htm#fr_1259">248:1</A> Dast&ucirc;r J&acirc;m&acirc;spji prefers reading pat&ocirc;shak, and thinks it means 'necessity,' as in cases where two deaths occur nearly simultaneously in the same house, when both corpses cannot be removed the same day. Such a meaning might suit this passage, but the word occurs again, in &sect; 33 and Chap. IX, 7, where it can refer only to 'contamination,' and the etymology of pa<I>d</I>v&icirc;shak (Av. paiti + vish) is plain enough.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1253"></A><A HREF="sbe0562.htm#fr_1260">248:2</A> That is, when two persons cannot be found to carry a corpse, one can do it alone, provided he holds a dog by a string. This course is adopted, Dast&ucirc;r J&acirc;m&acirc;spji says, when a person happens to die in a place where only one Parsi is available.</P>

The meaning of the text is that either or both of the corpse-carriers may be any Parsi man, woman, or child who understands the proper precautions. Compare Pahl. Vend. VIII, 28.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1258"></A><A HREF="sbe0562.htm#fr_1265">249:5</A> Inside the Dakhma apparently. The meaning seems to be, that when the Dakhma is flooded the corpse is to be laid down in some dry place in its vicinity until the flood has abated. But according to Pahl. Vend. VIII, 17, it is allowable to throw the corpse in when the Dakhma is full of water.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1259"></A><A HREF="sbe0562.htm#fr_1266">249:6</A> See Chaps. I, 3, II, 1. Here, again, the quotation must be from his complete commentary, as it is not extant in the present Pahlavi Vendidad.</P>

VI, 65-71). As the corpse, in nearly all cases, must be either at the bottom or on the surface, the quantity of polluted water to be drawn off must be a hemispherical mass sixteen feet in radius, or about forty-eight tons of water.</P>

Vend. IX, 133, 137, 141 a man when only partially purified must remain apart in the place for the arm&ecirc;<I>s</I>t (Av. airima, compare Sans. il or r&icirc;) for a certain time. N&ecirc;ry&ocirc;sang, in his Sanskrit translation of Mkh. (XXXVII, 36, XXXIX, 40, LI, 7), explains arm&ecirc;<I>s</I>t as 'lame, crippled, immobility;' it also means 'stagnant,' when applied to water; and its primitive signification was, probably, 'most stationary' an appropriate term for such unclean persons as are required to remain in a particular place apart from all others, as well as for helpless cripples, and insane persons under restraint (see Chap. VI, x). The meaning 'most polluted' would hardly apply to tank water.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1381"></A><A HREF="sbe0562.htm#fr_1390">274:1</A> This is doubtful; the word can be read pir&icirc;nak, and has the Pers. gloss p&icirc;r&ucirc;zah, 'turquoise,' in some MSS.
