### CHAPTER XVII.

1\. This, too, Zaratû*s*t asked of Aûharmazd, that is: 'Which is the
time when *one* must not eat meat?'

2\. Aûharmazd gave a reply thus: 'In a house when a person shall die,
until three nights are completed, nothing whatever of meat is to be
placed on a sacred cake (drôn) therein and in *its* vicinity <span
id="fr_1896"></span>[1](#fn_1884.md); but these, such as milk, cheese,
fruit, eggs, and preserves, are to be placed; *and* nothing whatever of
meat is to be eaten *by* his relations <span
id="fr_1897"></span>[2](#fn_1885.md). 3. In all the three days it is
necessary to perform the ceremonial (ya*z*i*s*n) of Srôsh for this
*reason*, because Srôsh will be able to save his soul from the hands of
the demons *for* the three days <span id="fr_1898"></span>[3](#fn_1886.md);
and when *one* constantly

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

performs a ceremonial *at* every period (gâs) <span
id="fr_1899"></span>[1](#fn_1887.md) in the three days *it* is *as* good as
though they should celebrate the whole religious ritual (hamâk dînô) at
one time. 4. And after the third night, *at* dawn, *one* is to
consecrate three sacred cakes (drôn), one *for* Rashnû *and* Â*s*tâ*d*,
the second *for* Vâê the good <span id="fr_1900"></span>[2](#fn_1888.md),
*and* the third *for* the righteous guardian spirit (ar*d*âî fravar*d*);
and clothing <span id="fr_1901"></span>[3](#fn_1889.md) is to be placed
upon the sacred cake of the righteous guardian spirit. 5. For the fourth
day it is allowable to slaughter a sheep <span
id="fr_1902"></span>[4](#fn_1890.md), *and* the fourth day the ceremonial
(ya*z*i*s*n) of the righteous guardian spirit is to be performed; and
afterwards are the tenth-day, the monthly, and, then, the annual
*ceremonies*; and the first monthly is exactly on the thirtieth day, and
the annual on the particular day <span
id="fr_1903"></span>[5](#fn_1891.md). 6. When he

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

shall die *at* a place distant *from that* where the information
arrives, when the three *days’ ceremonies* (satûîh) are celebrated *at*
that place where he shall die *it* is well, when not, their celebration
is *to be at* this place, *and* from the *time* when the information
arrives, until three nights are completed, it is necessary to perform
the ceremonial of Srôsh, *and* after three days and nights it is
necessary to perform the ceremonial of the righteous guardian spirit.'

7\. *In* one place *it* is declared, that of him whose begetting is
owing to the demons, of him who commits sodomy, and of him who performs
the religious rites (dînô) of apostasy, of none of the three do

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

they restore the dead <span id="fr_1904"></span>[1](#fn_1892.md), for this
*reason*, because he whose begetting is owing to the demons is himself a
demon <span id="fr_1905"></span>[2](#fn_1893.md), and the soul of him who
commits sodomy will become a demon <span
id="fr_1906"></span>[3](#fn_1894.md), and the soul of him *who* performs
the religious rites of apostasy will become a darting snake <span
id="fr_1907"></span>[4](#fn_1895.md).

8\. This, too, is revealed by the Avesta <span
id="fr_1908"></span>[5](#fn_1896.md), that Aûharmazd spoke thus: 'Give ye
up the persons of all men, with the submissiveness of worshippers, *to*
that man to whom the whole Avesta and Zand is easy <span
id="fr_1909"></span>[6](#fn_1897.md), so that he may make you acquainted
with duties and good works; because men go to hell for this *reason*,
when they do not submit *their* persons to priestly control
(aêrpatistân), and do not become acquainted with duties and good works.'

9\. Query:—There is an action which, according to the Avesta <span
id="fr_1910"></span>[7](#fn_1898.md), is not good for a person to do, *and*
the sentence of 'worthy of death' is set upon *it*; for *one's* better
preservation is *one* not to do that action,

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

or to accomplish *and* urge *it* on, for the advance of religion in a
state of uncertainty (var-hômandîh)? 10. The answer is this, that when
they act well for *their* better preservation *there* is no fear, on
account of acting well, but *one* is not to forsake that <span
id="fr_1911"></span>[1](#fn_1899.md), too, though *it* be not goodness; a
forsaken duty is very bad, for a contempt of it enters into one.

11\. This, too, is declared, that Zaratû*s*t enquired of Aûharmazd thus:
'From what place do these people rise again? from that place where they
first went into *their* mothers, or from that place where the mothers
have given *them* birth, or from that place where *their* bodies happen
*to be* (aûftê*d*)?' 12. Aûharmazd gave a reply thus: 'Not from that
place where they have gone into *their* mothers, nor from that place
where they have been born from *their* mothers, nor from that place
where *their* bodies and flesh happen *to be*, for they rise from that
place where the life went out from their bodies.' 13. And this, too, he
asked, that is: 'Whence do they raise <span
id="fr_1912"></span>[2](#fn_1900.md) *him* again who is suspended from
anything, *and* shall die in the air?' 14. The reply *was:* 'From that
place where his bones and flesh first fall to the ground; hence, except
when he shall die on a divan (gâs) or a bed (vistarg), before they carry
him away, whatever *it*

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

*is*, a fragment <span id="fr_1913"></span>[1](#fn_1901.md) is to be taken
and to be laid across his limbs; for when the usage is not so, they
raise him again from that place where his body arrives at the ground.'

15\. Completed in peace, pleasure, *and* joy <span
id="fr_1914"></span>[2](#fn_1902.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1884"></span>[382:1](sbe0577.htm#fr_1896.md) Reading va
hamgôshak, the latter word being apparently used in a parallel passage
in Pahl. Vend. VIII, 64 in old MSS.; this reading is, however, somewhat
doubtful here, and perhaps we ought to read 'on a sacred cake in that
roofed place (pavan zak vâmkînîh);' the last word being a possible term
for 'roofing' as it stands, though it may be a miswriting of vâmpô*s*
(Pers. bâmpô*s*, 'roofing').

<span id="fn_1885"></span>[382:2](sbe0577.htm#fr_1897.md) The Parsis,
nowadays (Dastûr Hoshangji says), do not cook for three days under a
roof where a death has occurred, but obtain food from their neighbours
and friends; but if the cookroom he under a separate roof, as often
happens in India, they have no objection to cooking there.

<span id="fn_1886"></span>[382:3](sbe0577.htm#fr_1898.md) The soul is
supposed to hover about the body for the first three nights after death,
during which time it has to rely upon the angel Srôsh (see Bund. XXX,
29) for protection from the demons, which the angel, it is presumed,
will afford more efficiently if properly propitiated by the surviving
relatives. At the third dawn after death (that is, the dawn of the
fourth day inclusive of the day of death) the soul is supposed to depart
finally for the other world (see AV. IV, 8-36, XVII, 5-27).

<span id="fn_1887"></span>[383:1](sbe0577.htm#fr_1899.md) These periods of
the day are five in summer, and four in winter (see Bund. XXV, 9, 10).

<span id="fn_1888"></span>[383:2](sbe0577.htm#fr_1900.md) The usual name of
the angel Râm (the Vayu of Râm Yt.) who, with the angels Rashnû and
Â*s*tâ*d*, is supposed to be stationed at the *K*inva*d* bridge, where
the soul has to give an account of its actions during life shortly after
the dawn following the third night after death (see AV. V. 3, CI, 21,
note, Mkh. II, 115).

<span id="fn_1889"></span>[383:3](sbe0577.htm#fr_1901.md) This clothing
must be new and good, and is supposed to be supplied to the spirit to
prevent its appearing unclothed in the other world, where the clothing
of the soul is said to be formed 'out of almsgivings' (Chap. XII, 4); to
fulfil which condition the clothes provided are presented to the
officiating priests (see Saddar Bundahi*s* LXXXVII).

<span id="fn_1890"></span>[383:4](sbe0577.htm#fr_1902.md) Or 'goat.'

<span id="fn_1891"></span>[383:5](sbe0577.htm#fr_1903.md) That is, on the
exact anniversary of the death; the sentence is rather obscure, but this
appears to be the meaning. With regard to the ceremonies after a death,
the Persian Rivâyats give more details, which may be summarized as
follows:—On each of the first three days a Srôsh Ya*s*t is performed and
a Srôsh Drôn consecrated (see Chap. III, 32, note). On the third night,
in the middle of the Aiwisrûthrem Gâh (dusk to midnight), a renunciation
<span id="page_384">p. 384</span> of sin is performed in the house of
the deceased; and in the Ushahin Gâh (midnight to dawn) four Drôns are
consecrated, one dedicated to the good Vâê (Nâ-î veh), one to Rashn and
Â*s*tâ*d*, one to Srôsh, and one to the righteous (ashôân), and in front
of the last are placed new and clean clothes with fruit, but without an
egg. On the fourth day, at sunrise, the Dahmân Âfrîngân (Yas. LIX) is
recited, and then the Khûrshê*d* and Mihir Nyâyi*s*, after which the
people in the house can first eat fresh-cooked meat. During the fourth
day also the Ya*s*t of the righteous is performed, and the Drôn of the
righteous is consecrated; and the same again on the tenth day, together
with the recitation of the Dahmân Âfrîngân. On the thirtieth day the
Sîrôzah (praise of the thirty days) is to be celebrated, with the
dedication to the thirty days; thirty-three beans (lûvak) and
thirty-three eggs, with fruit, being placed in front of the Drôn, which
is consecrated in the presence of fire; and, afterwards, the assistant
priest consecrates a Drôn for Srôsh. The next day the chief priest
consecrates a Drôn for the righteous; a suit of clothes and fruit being
placed in front of the Drôn. And each day a Ya*s*t of the righteous is
performed, a Drôn of the righteous is consecrated, and an Âfrîngân
recited. On the same day every month the same Ya*s*t, Drôn, and,
Âfrîngân are celebrated; a priest also undergoes the Bareshnûm for the
deceased, a Gêtî-kharî*d* (see Bund. XXX, 28) is performed, and three
Vendidads dedicated to Srôsh. On each day at the end of a year the
Sîrôzah Ya*s*t is performed, and a Drôn <span id="page_385">p.
385</span> dedicated to the thirty days is consecrated, thirty-three
beans being placed, with one Drôn, one Frasast (see Chap. III, 32,
note), one pentagonal Drôn as the sun, one crescent-shaped as the moon,
thirty-three eggs, and fruit, in front of the Drôn, which is consecrated
in the presence of fire; afterwards, the assistant priest consecrates a
Drôn for Srôsh, and recites the Dahmân Âfrîngân, and the next day the
chief priest consecrates a Drôn for the righteous, a suit of clothes
being placed before the Drôn, and recites the Dahmân Âfrîngân.

<span id="fn_1892"></span>[385:1](sbe0577.htm#fr_1904.md) That is, there is
no resurrection for them.

<span id="fn_1893"></span>[385:2](sbe0577.htm#fr_1905.md) And, therefore,
not immortal according to the Parsi faith.

<span id="fn_1894"></span>[385:3](sbe0577.htm#fr_1906.md) Compare Vend.
VIII, 98-106.

<span id="fn_1895"></span>[385:4](sbe0577.htm#fr_1907.md) Which being a
creature of the evil spirit is doomed to destruction.

<span id="fn_1896"></span>[385:5](sbe0577.htm#fr_1908.md) But it is
doubtful if the passage be extant.

<span id="fn_1897"></span>[385:6](sbe0577.htm#fr_1909.md) That is, the man
who knows the whole scripture and commentary by heart.

<span id="fn_1898"></span>[385:7](sbe0577.htm#fr_1910.md) Reading pavan
Avistâk, instead of Avistâk pavan.

<span id="fn_1899"></span>[386:1](sbe0577.htm#fr_1911.md) The religion in a
position of difficulty appears to be the meaning, but the reply to this
question of casuistry is by no means clear.

<span id="fn_1900"></span>[386:2](sbe0577.htm#fr_1912.md) Literally, 'they
rise,' both here and in the next section, but the change to the plural
number is perplexing, unless it refers to those who prepare the
resurrection of the dead (Bund. XXX, 4, 7, 17), as here assumed by
reading 'they raise.'

<span id="fn_1901"></span>[387:1](sbe0577.htm#fr_1913.md) Apparently a
fragment of the place whereon the death took place is meant by ka*d*âm-1
pârak.

<span id="fn_1902"></span>[387:2](sbe0577.htm#fr_1914.md) The miscellaneous
passages which follow Sls. in M6 terminate at this point, which is the
end of the first volume of that MS. The next three chapters are taken
from the latter end of the other volume of M6.
