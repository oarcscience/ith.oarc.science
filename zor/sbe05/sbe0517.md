### CHAPTER VIII.

0\. On the conflict which the evil spirit waged with the earth.

1\. As the evil spirit rushed in, the earth shook <span
id="fr_139"></span>[4](#fn_139.md), *and* the substance of mountains was
created in the earth. 2. First, Mount Albûr*z* arose; afterwards,

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

the other ranges of mountains (kôfânîhâ) of the middle of the earth; for
as Albûr*z* grew forth all the mountains remained in motion, for they
have all grown forth from the root of Albûr*z*. 3. At that time they
came up from the earth, like a tree which *has* grown up to the clouds
*and its* root <span id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_140.md) to the bottom; and
their root passed on that way *from* one to the other, *and* they are
arranged in mutual connection. 4. Afterwards, about that wonderful
shaking out from the earth, they say that a great mountain is the knot
of lands; *and* the passage for the waters within the mountains is the
root which is below the mountains; they forsake the upper *parts* so
that they may flow into it, just as the roots of trees pass into the
earth; a counterpart (ângunî-aîtak) of the blood in the arteries of men,
which gives strength to the whole body. 5. In numbers <span
id="fr_141"></span>[2](#fn_141.md), apart from Albûr*z*, all the mountains
grew up out of the earth in eighteen years <span
id="fr_142"></span>[3](#fn_142.md), from which *arises* the
perfection <span id="fr_143"></span>[4](#fn_143.md) of men's advantage.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_139"></span>[29:4](sbe0517.htm#fr_139.md) The word *g*udnî*d*
is a transposition of *g*undî*d*, a graphical variant of *g*unbî*d*,
'shook.'

<span id="fn_140"></span>[30:1](sbe0517.htm#fr_140.md) M6 has ra*k*âk, but
this and many other strange words are probably due to the copyist of
that MS. having an original before him which was nearly illegible in
many places.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[30:2](sbe0517.htm#fr_141.md) Or, 'as it were
innumerable;' the word amar meaning both 'number' and 'innumerable.'

<span id="fn_142"></span>[30:3](sbe0517.htm#fr_142.md) See Chap. XII, 1.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[30:4](sbe0517.htm#fr_143.md) The word must be
farhâkhtagân, 'proprieties,' both here and in Chap. IX, 6, as
farhâkhti*s*n is an ungrammatical form.
