### CHAPTER XXIII.

1\. On the nature of the ape *and* the bear they say, that Yim, when
reason (nismô) departed from, him <span id="fr_476"></span>[3](#fn_472.md),
for fear of the demons took a demoness as wife, and gave Yimak, who was
*his* sister, to a demon as wife; and from them have originated the
tailed ape and bear *and* other species of degeneracy.

2\. This, too, they say, that in the reign of A*z*-i Dahâk <span
id="fr_477"></span>[4](#fn_473.md) a young woman was admitted to a demon,
and a young man was admitted to a witch (parîk), and on seeing them they
had intercourse; owing to that one intercourse the black-skinned negro
arose from them. 3. When Frê*d*ûn <span id="fr_478"></span>[5](#fn_474.md)
came to them they fled from the country of Iran, *and* settled upon the
sea-coast; now, *through* the invasion of the Arabs, they are again
diffused through the country of Iran.

This is the Jamshêd of the Shâhnâmah. Perhaps for 'reason' we should
read 'glory.'
