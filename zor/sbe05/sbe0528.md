### CHAPTER XIX.

1\. Regarding the three-legged a ass <span
id="fr_345"></span>[4](#fn_343.md) they say, that it stands amid the
wide-formed ocean, and its feet are three, eyes six, mouths <span
id="fr_346"></span>[5](#fn_344.md) nine, ears two, and horn

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

one, body white, food spiritual, *and* it is righteous. 2. And two of
its six eyes are in the position of eyes, two on the; top of the head,
and two in the position of the hump <span
id="fr_347"></span>[1](#fn_345.md); with the sharpness of those six eyes it
overcomes *and* destroys. 3. Of the nine mouths three are in the head,
three in the hump, and three in the inner part of the flanks; and each
mouth is about the size of a cottage, and *it is* itself as large as
Mount Alvand <span id="fr_348"></span>[2](#fn_346.md). 4. Each one of the
three feet, when it is placed on the ground, is as much as a flock
(gir*d*) of a thousand sheep comes under when they repose together;
*and* each pastern <span id="fr_349"></span>[3](#fn_347.md) is so great in
its circuit that a thousand men with a thousand horses may pass inside.
5. As for the two ears *it is* Mâzendarân which they will encompass. 6.
The one horn is as it were of gold *and* hollow, and a thousand *branch*
horns <span id="fr_350"></span>[4](#fn_348.md) have grown upon it, some
befitting <span id="fr_351"></span>[5](#fn_349.md) a camel, some befitting
a horse, some befitting an ox, some befitting an ass, both great and
small. 7. With that horn it will vanquish *and* dissipate all the vile
corruption *due to* the efforts of noxious creatures.

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

8\. When that ass shall hold *its* neck in the ocean *its* ears will
terrify (asahmê*d*), *and* all the water of the wide-formed ocean will
shake with agitation, *and* the side of Ganâva*d* <span
id="fr_352"></span>[1](#fn_350) will tremble (shîvanê*d*.md). 9. When it
utters a cry all female water-creatures, of the creatures of Aûharmazd,
will become pregnant; and all pregnant noxious water-creatures, when
they hear that cry, will cast *their* young. 10. When it stales in the
ocean all the sea-water will become purified, which is in the seven
regions of the earth—*it is* even on that account when all asses which
come into water stale in the water—as it says thus: 'If, O three-legged
ass! you were not created for the water, all the water in the sea would
have perished from the contamination which the poison of the evil spirit
has brought into its water, through the death of the creatures of
Aûharmazd.'

11\. Tî*s*tar seizes the water <span id="fr_353"></span>[2](#fn_351.md)
more completely from the ocean with the assistance of the three-legged
ass. 12. Of ambergris also (ambar-i*k*) *it* is declared, that it is the
dung of the three-legged ass; for if it has much spirit food, then also
the moisture of the liquid nourishment goes through the veins
*pertaining* to the body into the urine, *and* the dung is cast away.

13\. Of the ox Hadhayô*s* <span id="fr_354"></span>[3](#fn_352.md), which
they call Sarsaok <span id="fr_355"></span>[4](#fn_353.md), it says, that
in the original creation men passed from region to region *upon it, and*
in the

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

renovation *of the universe* they prepare Hûsh (the beverage producing
immortality) from it. 14. It is said, that life is in the hand of that
foremost man, at the end of *his* years <span
id="fr_356"></span>[1](#fn_354.md), who has constructed the most defences
around this earth, until the renovation *of the universe* is requisite.

15\. Regarding the bird *K*âmrô*s* <span id="fr_357"></span>[2](#fn_355.md)
it says, that *it is* on the summit of Mount Albûr*z*; *and* every three
years many come from the non-Iranian districts for booty (gir*d*) <span
id="fr_358"></span>[3](#fn_356), by going to bring damage (zîyân.md) on the
Iranian districts, and to effect the devastation of the world; then the
angel Bûr*g* <span id="fr_359"></span>[4](#fn_357.md), *having* come up
from the low country of Lake Arag <span id="fr_360"></span>[5](#fn_358.md),
arouses that very bird *K*âmrô*s*, *and* it flies upon the loftiest of
all the lofty mountains, *and* picks up all those non-Iranian districts
as a bird *does* corn.

16\. Regarding Kar*s*ipt <span id="fr_361"></span>[6](#fn_359.md) they say,
that it knew how to speak words, *and* brought the religion to the
enclosure which Yim made, and circulated *it*; there they utter the
Avesta in the language of birds.

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

17\. Regarding the ox-fish they say, that it exists in all seas; when it
utters a cry all fish become pregnant, and all noxious water-creatures
cast *their* young.

18\. The griffon bird <span id="fr_362"></span>[1](#fn_360.md), which is a
bat, is noticed (kar*d*) twice in another chapter (babâ).

19\. Regarding the bird Ashôzu*s*t <span
id="fr_363"></span>[2](#fn_361.md), which is the bird Zobara <span
id="fr_364"></span>[3](#fn_362.md)-vahman *and* also the bird *S*ôk <span
id="fr_365"></span>[4](#fn_363.md), they say that it has given an Avesta
with *its* tongue; when it speaks the demons tremble at it *and* take
nothing away there; a nail-*paring*, when it is not prayed over
(afsû*d*), the demons *and* wizards seize, *and* like an arrow it shoots
at *and* kills that bird. 20. On this account the bird seizes *and*
devours a nail-*paring*, when it is prayed over, so that the demons may
not control *its* use; when it is not prayed over it does not devour
*it, and* the demons are able to commit an offence with it.

21\. Also other beasts and birds are created all in opposition to
noxious creatures, as it says, that when the birds *and* beasts are all
in opposition to noxious creatures and wizards, *&c.* <span
id="fr_366"></span>[5](#fn_364.md) 22. This, too, it says, that of all
precious <span id="fr_367"></span>[6](#fn_365) birds the crow (valâgh.md)
is the most precious. 23, Regarding the white falcon it

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

says, that it kills the serpent with wings. 24. The magpie (kâskînak)
bird kills the locust, *and* is created in opposition to it. 25. The
Kahrkâs <span id="fr_368"></span>[1](#fn_366.md), dwelling in decay, which
is the vulture, is created for devouring dead matter (nasâî); so also
are the crow (valâk) <span id="fr_369"></span>[2](#fn_367.md) and the
mountain kite.

26\. The mountain ox, the mountain goat, the deer, the wild ass, *and*
other beasts devour all snakes. 27. So also, of other *animals*, dogs
are created in opposition to the wolf species, *and* for securing the
protection of sheep; the fox is created in opposition to the demon
Khava; the ichneumon is created in opposition to the venomous snake
(gar*z*ak) *and* other noxious creatures in burrows; so also the great
musk-*animal* is created in opposition <span
id="fr_370"></span>[3](#fn_368.md) to ravenous intestinal worms
(ka*d*ûk-dânak gar*z*ak). 28. The hedgehog is created in opposition to
the ant which carries off grain <span id="fr_371"></span>[4](#fn_369.md),
as it says, that the hedgehog, every time that it voids urine into an
ant's nest, will destroy a thousand ants; when the grain-carrier travels
over the earth it produces

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

a hollow track <span id="fr_372"></span>[1](#fn_370.md); when the hedgehog
travels over it the track goes away from it, and it becomes level. 29.
The water-beaver is created in opposition to the demon which is in the
water. 30. The conclusion is this, that, of all beasts and birds and
fishes, every one is created in opposition to some noxious creature.

31\. Regarding the vulture (karkâs) it says, that, even from his highest
flight, he sees when flesh the size of a fist is on the ground; and the
scent of musk is created under his wing, so that if, in devouring dead
matter, the stench of the dead matter comes *out* from it, he puts *his*
head back under the wing *and* is comfortable again. 32. Regarding the
Arab horse they say, that if, in a dark night, a single hair occurs on
the ground, he sees *it*.

33\. The cock is created in opposition to demons *and* wizards,
co-operating with the dog; as it says in revelation, that, of the
creatures of the world, those which are co-operating with Srôsh <span
id="fr_373"></span>[2](#fn_371.md), in destroying the fiends, are the cock
and the dog. 34. This, too, it says, that it would not have *been*
managed if I had not created the shepherd's dog, which is the
Pasu*s*-haurva <span id="fr_374"></span>[3](#fn_372.md), *and* the house
watchdog, the Vi*s*-haurva <span id="fr_375"></span>[3](#fn_372.md); for it
says in revelation, that the dog is a destroyer of such a fiend as
covetousness,

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

among those which are in the nature (aîtîh) of man and of animals. 35.
Moreover it says, that, inasmuch as it will destroy all the disobedient,
when it barks it will destroy pain <span
id="fr_376"></span>[1](#fn_373.md); and its flesh and fat are remedies for
driving away decay and pain from men <span
id="fr_377"></span>[2](#fn_374.md).

36\. Aûharmazd created nothing useless whatever, for all these (kolâ aê)
are created for advantage; when one does not understand the reason of
them, it is necessary to ask the Dastûr ('high-priest'), for his five
dispositions (khûk) <span id="fr_378"></span>[3](#fn_375.md) are created in
this way that he may continually destroy the fiend (or deceit).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_343"></span>[67:4](sbe0528.htm#fr_345.md) The Av. khara,
'which is righteous *and* which stands in the middle of the wide-shored
ocean' (Yas. XLI, 28). Darmesteter, in his Ormazd et Ahriman (pp.
148-151), considers this mythological monster as a meteorological myth,
a personification of clouds and storm; and, no doubt, a vivid
imagination may trace a striking resemblance between some of the
monster's attributes and certain fanciful ideas regarding the phenomena
of nature; the difficulty is to account for the remaining attributes,
and to be sure that these fanciful ideas were really held by
Mazdayasnians of old. Another plausible view is to consider such
mythological beings as foreign gods tolerated by the priesthood, from
politic motives, as objects worthy of reverence; even as the goddess
Anâhita was tolerated in the form of the angel of water.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[67:5](sbe0528.htm#fr_346.md) This is the
traditional meaning of the word, which (if this <span id="page_67">p.
67</span> meaning be correct) ought probably to be read yông, and be
traced to Av. *e*e*a*ungh (Yas. XXVIII, ii). In the MSS. the word is
marked as if it were pronounced gûnd, which means 'a testicle.'

<span id="fn_345"></span>[68:1](sbe0528.htm#fr_347.md) The hump is probably
supposed to be over the shoulders, as in the Indian ox, and not like
that of the camel.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[68:2](sbe0528.htm#fr_348.md) Near Hamadân, rising
11,000 feet above the sea, or 6000 above Hamadân. It may be one of the
Av. Aurva*n*tô of Zamyâd Yt. 3. The Pâzand MSS. read Hunavand.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[68:3](sbe0528.htm#fr_349.md) Literally, 'the
small of the foot,' khûr*d*ak-i ragelman.

<span id="fn_348"></span>[68:4](sbe0528.htm#fr_350.md) Or, 'a thousand
cavities (srûbŏ, Pers. surub, ‘cavern’) have grown in it.'

<span id="fn_349"></span>[68:5](sbe0528.htm#fr_351.md) Reading zîyâk;
compare Pers. ziyîdan, 'to suit, befit.'

<span id="fn_350"></span>[69:1](sbe0528.htm#fr_352.md) A mountain (see
Chap. XII, 29, 34).

<span id="fn_351"></span>[69:2](sbe0528.htm#fr_353.md) See Chap. VII, 11.

<span id="fn_352"></span>[69:3](sbe0528.htm#fr_354.md) Written Hadayâv*s*
in the MSS. in Chap. XXX, 25, and Hadhayãs in the Dâ*d*istân-i Dînîk,
Part II, reply 89; it is a Pâzand reading in all three places.

<span id="fn_353"></span>[69:4](sbe0528.htm#fr_355.md) See Chaps. XV, 27,
XVII, 4.

<span id="fn_354"></span>[70:1](sbe0528.htm#fr_356.md) Transcribing the
Pâz. *s*vadyi into Pahlavi we have *s*natîh, 'term of years.' The whole
sentence is very obscure.

<span id="fn_355"></span>[70:2](sbe0528.htm#fr_357.md) Written *K*amrô*s*
in Chap. XXIV, 29. It is the Av. *K*amrao*s* (gen. of *K*amru) of
Fravardîn Yt. 109. See also Chap. XVII, 3.

<span id="fn_356"></span>[70:3](sbe0528.htm#fr_358.md) Or, 'to an
assembly.'

<span id="fn_357"></span>[70:4](sbe0528.htm#fr_359.md) The Av. Bere*g*ya of
Yas. I, 21, II, 27, III, 35, 'a spirit cooperating with the Ushahina
Gâh, who causes the increase of herds and corn.'

<span id="fn_358"></span>[70:5](sbe0528.htm#fr_360.md) Or, 'of the district
of Arag' (see the note on Chap. XII, 23). Although no Lake Arag is
described in Chap. XXII, some of the epithets referring to its Avesta
equivalent Rangha are more applicable to a lake than to a river, as in
Bahrâm Yt. 29. Possibly the low lands between the Caspian and Aral, or
on the shores of the Caspian, are meant.

<span id="fn_359"></span>[70:6](sbe0528.htm#fr_361.md) The Av. vi*s*
kar*s*ipta of Vend. II, 139, where, however, vi*s* <span id="page_71">p.
71</span> does not mean 'bird,' and the Pahlavi translator calls it 'a
quadruped.' In the Pahl. Visp. I, 1, 'the Kar*s*ipt is the chief of
flying creatures,' and the Bundahi*s* also takes it as a bird (see
Chaps. XIV, 23, XXIV, 11).

<span id="fn_360"></span>[71:1](sbe0528.htm#fr_362.md) See Chaps. XIV, 11,
23, 24, XXIV, 11, 29.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[71:2](sbe0528.htm#fr_363.md) The Av. Ashô-zu*s*ta
of Vend. XVII, 26, 28.

<span id="fn_362"></span>[71:3](sbe0528.htm#fr_364.md) Compare Pers.
*z*ûlah, 'a sparrow or lark.'

<span id="fn_363"></span>[71:4](sbe0528.htm#fr_365.md) Compare Pers. *s*ak,
'a magpie.'

<span id="fn_364"></span>[71:5](sbe0528.htm#fr_366.md) This quotation is
evidently left incomplete.

<span id="fn_365"></span>[71:6](sbe0528.htm#fr_367.md) The Pahlavi word is
ambiguous; it may be read zîl, 'cheap, common,' or it may be zagar =
yakar, 'dear, precious,' but the <span id="page_72">p. 72</span> latter
seems most probable, although the crow is perhaps as 'common' as it is
'precious,' as a scavenger in the East. Singularly enough Pers. arzân is
a synonym to both words, as it means both 'cheap' and 'worthy.'

<span id="fn_366"></span>[72:1](sbe0528.htm#fr_368.md) The Av. kahrkâsa of
Vend. III, 66, IX, 181, Âbân Yt. 61, Mihir Yt. 129; its epithet
zarmân-mâni*s*n, 'dwelling in decay,' is evidently intended as a
translation of the Av. zarenumaini*s*, applied to it in Bahrâm Yt. 33,
Dîn Yt. 13.

<span id="fn_367"></span>[72:2](sbe0528.htm#fr_369.md) The text should
probably be valâk-i sîyâk va sâr-i gar, 'the black crow and the mountain
kite,' which are given as different birds in Shâyast-lâ-shâyast, II, 5.

<span id="fn_368"></span>[72:3](sbe0528.htm#fr_370.md) K20 omits the words
from this 'opposition' to the next one.

<span id="fn_369"></span>[72:4](sbe0528.htm#fr_371.md) The môr-i dânak-kash
is the Av. maoiri*s* dânô-karsô of Vend. XIV, 14, XVI; 28, XVIII, 146.

<span id="fn_370"></span>[73:1](sbe0528.htm#fr_372.md) Comparing sûrâk with
Pers. surâgh in preference to sûrâkh or sûlâkh, 'a hole.'

<span id="fn_371"></span>[73:2](sbe0528.htm#fr_373.md) Av. Sraosha, the
angel who is said specially to protect the world from demons at night;
he is usually styled 'the righteous,' and is the special opponent of the
demon Aêshm, 'Wrath' (see Chap. XXX, 29).

<span id="fn_372"></span>[73:3](sbe0528.htm#fr_375.md) These are the Avesta
names of those two kinds of dog (see Chap. XIV, 19).

<span id="fn_373"></span>[74:1](sbe0528.htm#fr_376.md) Or it may be thus:
'For it says thus: Wherewith will it destroy? When it barks it will
destroy the assembly (gir*d*) of all the disobedient.'

<span id="fn_374"></span>[74:2](sbe0528.htm#fr_377.md) This is the most
obvious meaning, but Spiegel (in a note to Windischmann's Zoroastrische
Studien, p. 95) translates both this sentence and the next very
differently, so as to harmonize with Vend. XIII, 78, 99.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[74:3](sbe0528.htm#fr_378.md) The five
dispositions (khîm) of priests are thus detailed in old Pahlavi MSS.:
'First, innocence; second, discreetness of thoughts, words, and deeds;
third, holding the priestly office as that of a very wise and very
true-speaking master, who has learned religion attentively and teaches
*it* truly; fourth, celebrating the worship of God (yazdân) with a
ritual (nîrang) of rightly spoken words and scriptures known by heart
(narm naskîhâ); fifth, remaining day and night propitiatingly in *his*
vocation, struggling with his own resistance (hamêstâr), and, *all* life
long, not turning away from steadfastness in religion, and being
energetic in *his* vocation.'
