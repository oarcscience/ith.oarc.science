### CHAPTER IV.

1\. This also is said, that when the primeval ox <span
id="fr_99"></span>[1](#fn_99) passed away it fell to the right hand,
*and* Gâyômar*d* afterwards, when he passed *away*, to the left hand. 2.
Gô*s*ûrvan <span id="fr_100"></span>[2](#fn_100), as the soul of the
primeval ox came out from the body of the ox, stood up before the ox
*and* cried to Aûharmazd, as much as a thousand men when they sustain a
cry at one time, thus: 'With whom is the guardianship of the creatures
left by thee, when ruin *has* broken into the earth, and vegetation is
withered, and water is troubled? Where is the man <span
id="fr_101"></span>[3](#fn_101) of whom it was said by thee thus: I
*will* produce *him*, so that he may preach carefulness?'

3\. And Aûharmazd spoke thus: 'You are made ill <span
id="fr_102"></span>[4](#fn_102), O Gô*s*ûrvan! you, have the illness
which the evil spirit brought on if it were proper to produce that man
in this earth at this time, the. evil spirit would not have been
oppressive in it.'

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

4\. Forth Gô*s*ûrvan walked to the star station (pâyak) *and* cried in
the same manner, and forth to the moon station *and* cried in the same
manner, *and* forth to the sun station, and then the guardian spirit of
Zaratû*s*t was exhibited to her, *and Aûharmazd said* thus <span
id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_103): 'I will produce for the world *him* who
will preach carefulness.' 5. Contented became the spirit Gô*s*ûrvan, and
assented thus: 'I will nourish the creatures;' that is, she became again
consenting to a worldly creation in the world.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_99"></span>[20:1](sbe0513.htm#fr_99) Literally, 'the
sole-created ox' from whom all the animals and some plants are supposed
to have proceeded (see Chaps. X and XIV), as mankind proceeded from
Gâyômar*d*. It is the ox of the primitive creation, mentioned in Chap.
III, 14, 18.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[20:2](sbe0513.htm#fr_100) The spiritual
representative of the primeval ox, called G*e*u*s*-urvâ, 'soul of the
bull,' in the Avesta, of which name Gô*s*ûrvan is a corruption. The
complaint of Gô*s*ûrvan is recorded in the Gâthas, the oldest part of
the Avesta (see Yas, XXIX).

<span id="fn_101"></span>[20:3](sbe0513.htm#fr_101) Referring to
Zaratû*s*t.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[20:4](sbe0513.htm#fr_102) In K20, 'You are
ill.'

<span id="fn_103"></span>[21:1](sbe0513.htm#fr_103) As the text stands
in the MSS. it means, 'and then the guardian spirit of Zaratû*s*t
demonstrated to her thus;' but whether it be intended to represent the
fravâhar as producing the creature is doubtful. The angel Gô*s*, who is
identified with Gô*s*ûrvan, is usually considered a female, but this is
hardly consistent with being the soul of a bull (see Chap. X, 1, 2),
though applicable enough to a representative of the earth. In the
Selections of Zâ*d*-sparam, II, 6, however, this mythological animal is
said to have been a female (see Appendix to Bundahi*s*).
