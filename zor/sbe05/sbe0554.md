### CHAPTER X.

1\. As he (Aharman) came sixthly *to* Gâyômar*d* there was arrayed
against *him*, with Gâyômar*d*, the

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

pure propitious liturgy (mânsarspend), as heard from Gâyômar*d*; *and*
Aûharmazd, in pure meditation, considered that which is good and
righteousness as destruction of the fiend (drû*g*ô). 2. And when he
(Gâyômar*d*) passed away eight kinds of mineral of a metallic character
arose from *his* various members; they are gold, silver, iron, brass,
tin, lead, quicksilver (â*v*gînakŏ), and adamant; *and* on account of
the perfection of gold it is produced from the life and seed.

3\. Spendarma*d* received the gold of the dead Gâyômar*d* <span
id="fr_1022"></span>[1](#fn_1015), *and* it was forty years in the
earth. 4. At the end of the forty years, *in* the manner of a
Rîvâs-*plant*, Mashya *and* Mashyôî <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[2](#fn_1016) came up, and, one joined to the other,
*were* of like stature *and* mutually adapted <span
id="fr_1024"></span>[3](#fn_1017); and its middle, on which a glory
came, through their like stature <span
id="fr_1025"></span>[4](#fn_1018), *was* such that it was not clear
which is the male and which the female, and which is the one with the
glory which Aûharmazd created. 5. This is that glory for which man is,
indeed, created, as it is thus said in revelation:

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Which existed
before, the glory <span id="fr_1026"></span>[1](#fn_1019) or the body?'
And Aûharmazd spoke thus: 'The glory was created by me before;
afterwards, for him who is created, the glory is given a body so that it
may produce activity, and its body is created only for activity.' 6.
And, afterwards, they changed from the shape of a plant into the shape
of man <span id="fr_1027"></span>[2](#fn_1020), *and* the glory went
spiritually into them.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1015"></span>[183:1](sbe0554.htm#fr_1022) Compare Bund. XV,
1.

<span id="fn_1016"></span>[183:2](sbe0554.htm#fr_1023) The MS. has
Mashâî Mashâyê, but see Bund. XV, 6. The Avesta forms were probably
mashya mashyôi (or mashyê), which are regular nominatives dual,
masculine and feminine, of mashya, 'mortal,' and indicate that they were
usually coupled together in some part of the Avesta which is no longer
extant. Pâzand writers have found it easy to read Mashyanî instead of
Mâshyôî.

<span id="fn_1017"></span>[183:3](sbe0554.htm#fr_1024) Reading
ham-ba*s*nŏ ham-dakhîk, but whether this is more likely to be the
original reading than the ham-badi*s*n va ham-dasak of Bund. XV, 2, is
doubtful. The last epithet here might also be read ham-sabîk, 'having
the same shirt,' but this is an improbable meaning.

<span id="fn_1018"></span>[183:4](sbe0554.htm#fr_1025) It is evident
that ham-bandi*s*nîh, 'mutual connection,' in accordance with Bund. XV,
3, would be preferable to the ham-ba*s*nŏîh, 'like stature,' of this
text.

<span id="fn_1019"></span>[184:1](sbe0554.htm#fr_1026) The old word
nismô, 'soul' (see Bund. XV, 3, 4), has become corrupted here (by the
omission of the initial stroke) into gadman, 'glory.' This corruption
may be due either to Dâ*d*-sparam not understanding the word (in which
case the Bundahi*s* must have been an old book in his time), or else to
some later copyist confounding the old word for 'soul' with the
better-known 'glory' of the Iranian sovereigns.

<span id="fn_1020"></span>[184:2](sbe0554.htm#fr_1027) Bund. XV, 5.
