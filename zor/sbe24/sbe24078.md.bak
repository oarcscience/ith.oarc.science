### CHAPTER VIII.

1\. Again, about the existence of a competing *and* different original
evolution <span id="fr_759"></span>[2](#fn_751), *there* are these (2.md)
that are manifest from the good and evil which are in the world, (3) and
the particulars of *its* good maker which are self-limited. 4. Such as
darkness and light, (5) erudition *and* ignorance, (6) perfume and
stench, (7) life and death, (8) sickness and health, (9) order (dâ*d*)
and disorder, (10) distress and freedom from care (â*z*â*d*îh), (11)
*and* other co-existing <span id="fr_760"></span>[3](#fn_752.md) factors
whose certain existence is visible in every district *and* land, and
every age. 12. So that no district *or* land whatever is discovered, nor
yet any age *has* existed *or* shall exist, (13) wherein these good and
bad terms and particulars *have* not existed *or* do not exist. 14. And
it is not possible to say, as to any place *or* age, that good and evil
are changeable in themselves by their own nature.

15\. So, moreover, of the other co-existences whose difference is not
through different duty, through different species, *or* through
different quality—(16) as the difference of those of a like nature among
one another, such as male *and* female, (17) *of* the varieties

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

of scents *and* flavours, and *of* the sun *and* moon *and* stars, whose
difference is not through different nature, but through different duty,
through different qualification, and through different construction,
which are such as are attainable for various duties—(18) the good and
evil, light and dark, *and* other different natures are then their
distinction not through different duty, but through different nature,
(19) the incompatible quality and the injuriousness which are manifest
*in* them, one towards the other. 20. Therefore, when good is
there <span id="fr_761"></span>[1](#fn_753.md), the non-existence of evil
is unquestionable; (21) when light *has* come, darkness is removed. 22.
Even so *of* the other co-existences <span
id="fr_762"></span>[2](#fn_754.md) whose incompatibility and injuriousness
together are owing to the cause of difference of nature, (23) because,
in the worldly *existence, there* is a manifestation of the competing
nature and injuriousness of the things, one towards the other.

24\. The worldly *existence* is the fruit of the spiritual, and the
spiritual is its root, (25) because fruit is obtained through a root.
26. *In* like manner the giver of the evidence arisen among the
intelligent is clear. 27. Of the worldly *existence being* the fruit,
*and* the spiritual being the root, the evidence is this, (28) when the
progress (ma*d*anŏ) of every visible *and* tangible thing from
imperceptibility to perceptibility is explicitly manifest. 29. Because
the arising of mankind and other creatures,

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

who are visible *and* tangible, from a spiritual *existence* which is
invisible *and* intangible is known, (30) as much as the mirrored length
*and* breadth of the body *being* an emanation of itself. 31. And the
perceptibility of the body of man and other creatures was imperceptible
*and* invisible in the semen which is *derived* from *their* fathers;
(32) the semen itself, too, came into perceptibility, visibility, *and*
tangibility in the skin <span id="fr_763"></span>[1](#fn_755.md) of the
fathers.

33\. It is now possible to know inevitably <span
id="fr_764"></span>[2](#fn_756.md) that this worldly *existence*, which is
visible *and* tangible, is produced *and* has arisen from a spiritual
*existence* which is invisible *and* intangible. 34. *In* like manner
the lapsing (yehevûntanŏ) from visibility *and* tangibility into
invisibility *and* intangibility <span id="fr_765"></span>[3](#fn_757.md),
which are themselves a spiritual *state*, is unquestionable.

35\. When *these* are seen by us, in the worldly *existence*, the
competing nature, formation, and injuriousness of one towards the other,
even as to the property of the spiritual *existence*, (36) which is the
root of the worldly *one*; (37) and, *in* like manner, *there* is no
doubt of the existence of its fruit of worldly possessions; (38) this is
that which is manifest as regards a competing nature. 39. Then <span
id="fr_766"></span>[4](#fn_758.md) its purpose and cause *were* indicated
by me above <span id="fr_767"></span>[5](#fn_759.md), which are the
sagaciously working of the creator, (40) who created the creature which
is an indicator of the existence *of* an opponent.

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

41\. For *it* is known that work due to workers is *of* two kinds,
designed or qualified. 42. That which is designed is *of* three kinds.
43. Two are due to the wise *and* sagacious; (44) either through seeking
for their own working of advantage and benefit, (45) or *through*
removing *and* keeping away the harm and evil which are from without.
46. And one is due to the ignorant *and* unwise, (47) *done* defectively
*and* without a purpose. 48. From the wise *and* sagacious, work
ought <span id="fr_768"></span>[1](#fn_760.md) not to arise without a
purpose *and* without a cause.

49\. As the sagacious creator, who is all-knowing, perfectly capable,
*and* fully complete in his own self, *has* sought that which is not a
necessity for any advantage and aggrandizement of his from without <span
id="fr_769"></span>[2](#fn_761), (50.md) it is, therefore, necessary to
understand that the purpose *and* causes of his works are *of* that one
kind <span id="fr_770"></span>[3](#fn_762), (51.md) to remove *and* keep
away the harm which is due to his opponent and the injurer who may arise
from without, which is itself the purpose and cause of the creation of
the creatures. 52. Also this, that that sagacious creator is
good-willed, (53) and his will is all goodness. 54. The creatures *were*
also created by him predominantly of his own will. 55. And the
completely-stirring desire of him who is good-willed *and* sagacious is
to subdue <span id="fr_771"></span>[4](#fn_763.md) evil *and* make *it*
extinct, (56) for while evil is not subdued the

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

will of him who is good-willed is not fulfilled. 57. *And* this, that
the goodness of that sagacious creator is manifest from creativeness,
cherishing, and protection, *and from* commanding *and* teaching the
means of putting away the path of evil and causing forbearance from
crime; (58) also from the qualities and powers of the body in pain and
sickness from without.

59\. And, as a cause of the body, (60) to remove and keep away the
opponent who comes to the body, *and to be* the maintenance, the cause
of maturity, and the cause of growth of animals *and* sprouting
plants <span id="fr_772"></span>[1](#fn_764.md), through the power of
maintaining *and* cherishing *their* qualities, *there* is a co-operator
who is scripturally called the Fravash <span
id="fr_773"></span>[2](#fn_765.md). 61. And through those four powers that
are accumulative, which are the powers of attracting, seizing,
digesting, *and* extracting—(62) and which, owing to the creator's
sagacity of every kind, are co-operators with proportionate power for
keeping away the pain and sickness of various kinds which are owing to
the opponent, who is working defectively *and* desirous of evil—(63) and
*through* others *that* are of like strength *and* auxiliary, the good
will of the creator is manifest.

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

64\. Of this, too, that this *one* is no creator of the pain and death
which are dissipaters of the body, who is good-willed *and* a maintainer
and cherisher of the body, (65) the evidence is even from this, when the
sagacious creator is not a sufferer from sorrow (apakhshadâr) and
performing penitence, (66) and is no dissipater and disabler of his own
achievements <span id="fr_774"></span>[1](#fn_766), (67.md) because *he* is
sagacious and all-knowing.

68\. *As to* this *other and* the sorrow *and* penitence of the kind
which is owing to his own work, it is fitting to speak about him *as* of
deficient knowledge, incomplete wisdom, and inconclusive understanding.
69. As work does not arise from the wise and sagacious without a purpose
*and* without a cause <span id="fr_775"></span>[2](#fn_767), (70.md) *in*
like manner work from the unwise *and* ignorant *and* those of
inconclusive understanding is all defective, without a purpose, *and*
without a cause <span id="fr_776"></span>[3](#fn_768.md). 71. And that
sagacious *one* is a contriver, working sagaciously *and* methodically,
for keeping away that defective work and inconclusive understanding from
his own creatures.

72\. He who is working defectively produced distorted <span
id="fr_777"></span>[4](#fn_769.md) *and* entangled scriptures among the
creatures; (73) because this is known, that it is not possible so to
keep away *and* cramp <span id="fr_778"></span>[5](#fn_770.md) him who is a
moving *and* living nature in a boundless void, *and*

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

to become without risk of injury <span id="fr_779"></span>[1](#fn_771.md).
74. But, though he does not become entangled, fenced in, and captive,
(75) *he* is spreading anguish into the entanglement and captivity, and
*it* is a means of grievous punishment. 76. Only while a complete wiping
away of the anguish *due to* him, and complete information as to his own
ignorant activity do not arise, he *has* meditated <span
id="fr_780"></span>[2](#fn_772.md) with lying falsehood on that which is
connected therewith. 77. And the complete capability of the almighty
creator is the wiping away of the anguish.

78\. Owing to the complete wiping away of anguish, through the
almightiness of the sagacious creator, he casts *him* back impotent into
the boundless void. 79. *And* the good creatures thereby become
fearless, immortal, *and* undistressed (80) *through* the completely
methodical sagacity and discernment of means of that omniscient creator
of good beings.

81\. From observation of possessions the difference of things is
manifest. 82. And the difference is *of* two kinds, as mentioned
above <span id="fr_781"></span>[3](#fn_773.md). 83. One is difference of
operation, and the other is difference of nature. 84. Difference of
operation is owing to mutual assistance and united strength <span
id="fr_782"></span>[4](#fn_774), (85.md) and difference of nature is owing
to want of an adapter

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

and *to* opposition. 86. And not in a single place is a permanence of
possessions manifest.

87\. If one of anything shall exist *and* one does not exist, *its* name
shall exist, (88) for the sake of recognising things, one from the
other, and preserving the name. 89. The bad, by separation from the good
existence, is originally evolved *in* such a manner that the one is
really no cause of the other. 90. Because each one is existent
(aît-hômand) through its own self, (91) owing to the perpetual injury
*and* antagonism which are manifestly theirs, one towards the other.

92\. If any one shall say that, as the competing *formations* of the
competitors are numerous—(93) such as good *and* evil, dark *and* light,
perfume *and* stench, life *and* death, sickness *and* health, pleasure
*and* vexation—(94) there ought to be many other such original
evolutions, many *in* number and of many species; (95) then they *may*
give this reply <span id="fr_783"></span>[1](#fn_775), (96.md) that, even
when *there* are many names and many species of competitors, still then
all are within the compass <span id="fr_784"></span>[2](#fn_776.md) of two
names. 97. And these two names are their including-source, which are
good and evil. 98. Their different names and different species are
tokens of these two sources.

99\. *There* is nothing whatever that is not *in* the compass of these
two names. 100. *There has* not been and *will* not be anything which is
not good or evil, or a mixture of both. 101. On which account

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

*it* is explicitly manifest that the original evolutions are two, *and*
not more; (102) *and* also this, that it is not possible *for* good to
arise from evil, and evil from good.

103\. From this, too, it is possible to understand <span
id="fr_785"></span>[1](#fn_777), (104.md) that it is not possible *for*
complete evil to arise from that thing which is filled with goodness.
105. If it be possible, then *it* is not full; (106) because *any* one
thing, when said *to be* full, is no place *for* anything else; (107)
and when *there* is no place *for* anything else, other things are not
improved by it.

108\. If the sacred being *be* perfect in goodness and wisdom, the folly
and evil of *any* one are known not to arise from him. 109. If it be
possible for them to arise from him, then *he* is not perfect. 110. If
*he be* not perfect, it is not proper to glorify *him* for the
sacredness of complete goodness. 111. If good and evil have crept on
from the sacred being, *he* is imperfect in goodness. 112. If *he be*
imperfect in goodness, *he* is imperfect in good information. 113. If*he
be* imperfect in good information, so also *he* is imperfect in wisdom,
understanding, knowledge, intellect, and other appliances of sagacity.
114. If *he be* imperfect in wisdom, understanding, intellect, *and*
knowledge, *he* is imperfect in health. 115. If *he be* imperfect in
health, he is apt to become sick. 116. If he be apt to become sick, *he*
is imperfect in life.

117\. If any one shall speak thus: 'I always see that from one nature,
such as *that of* mankind, alike good and alike evil have always crept
on, through actions owing to them,' (118) that is for this reason,

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

because mankind are not perfect even in one *thing*. 119. And on account
of imperfection in goodness, evil has crept on from them; (120) and also
on account of imperfection, even in health, they become sick. 121. For
the same reason they die, (122) because the cause of death is the
struggling of two competing propensities within one nature. 123. There
where two competing propensities exist within one nature, the occurrence
of sickness and death is known.

124\. If any one shall say that there are good and evil actions which,
until they are done, do not exist, (125) then they *may* give this
reply <span id="fr_786"></span>[1](#fn_778), (126.md) that the occurrence
of an action apart from doing is as impossible as any propensity apart
from a nature; and, as to the nature, (127) its <span
id="fr_787"></span>[2](#fn_779.md) continuance and arrangement are then
known thereby not to occur through its own self. 128. For when a man
indulges in wrath, Vohûman <span id="fr_788"></span>[3](#fn_780.md) is far
from there; (129) and when Vohûman holds the position, wrath is not
there. 130. When a man tells a lie, truth is far from there <span
id="fr_789"></span>[4](#fn_781); (131.md) and when he speaks true,
falsehood has no position there, and that man is called truthful. 132.
So also when sickness *has* come, health is not there; (133) and when
health *has* come, sickness *has* gone.

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 134. Just as a
substance which is not moving can exist, (135) but movement, except in a
substance, cannot exist.

136\. About this chapter, too, collected as a summary, (137) do you
reverently <span id="fr_790"></span>[1](#fn_782.md) and discreetly observe
and instruct thereon.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_751"></span>[152:2](sbe24078.htm#fr_759.md) See Chap. IV, 73
n.

<span id="fn_752"></span>[152:3](sbe24078.htm#fr_760.md) And, therefore,
competing, as their natures are different.

<span id="fn_753"></span>[153:1](sbe24078.htm#fr_761.md) Sans. has 'so that
where (yatra) good is,' which has induced JE to insert Pâz. *e*dar for
Sans. yatra, so as to make the author say 'when good is here (in this
world), the non-existence of evil there (in the other world) is
unquestionable.' A noteworthy instance of punctilious blundering, on the
part of a revising copyist, making an author say more than he means.

<span id="fn_754"></span>[153:2](sbe24078.htm#fr_762.md) Mentioned in §§
5-11; those in § 4 having been just referred to.

<span id="fn_755"></span>[154:1](sbe24078.htm#fr_763.md) That Nêr. thus
read pôst is shown by his Sanskrit translation of the word, but the
original word was probably pô*s*t, 'the back.'

<span id="fn_756"></span>[154:2](sbe24078.htm#fr_764.md) See Chap. V, 12-14
for the technical meaning of this word.

<span id="fn_757"></span>[154:3](sbe24078.htm#fr_765.md) As in the case of
death and decay.

<span id="fn_758"></span>[154:4](sbe24078.htm#fr_766.md) Reading
adina*s*am, 'then its by me,' which is the Pahlavi form indicated by the
Pâz. ainâum of Nêr. (see Mkh. IX, 6 n).

<span id="fn_759"></span>[154:5](sbe24078.htm#fr_767.md) Chap. VII, 4, 5,
19-21.

<span id="fn_760"></span>[155:1](sbe24078.htm#fr_768.md) Reading sa*z*ê*d*,
as in JE, because, although AK, PB3, MH19 have Pâz. sah*ed*, 'seems,'
Nêr. uses Sans. *s*aknoti.

<span id="fn_761"></span>[155:2](sbe24078.htm#fr_769.md) And, therefore,
cannot have been actuated by the design mentioned in § 44.

<span id="fn_762"></span>[155:3](sbe24078.htm#fr_770.md) Mentioned in § 45.

<span id="fn_763"></span>[155:4](sbe24078.htm#fr_771.md) Reading khvâftanŏ,
instead of Pâz. anâftan, which is almost identical in writing; and
making a similar correction in § 56.

<span id="fn_764"></span>[156:1](sbe24078.htm#fr_772.md) Pâz. rôdamãnã,
which Nêr translates by the Sanskrit for 'trees and grains;' and the
occurrence of the latter word has induced some reviser of AK to alter
the following words zôr-i dârâ, 'power of maintaining,' into zôridâêã,
'grains,' which alteration has been adopted by MH19 and PB3, but the
latter has also zôr-i dârâ inserted in the margin, while JE has both
readings in the text which thus means 'through the power of maintaining
*and* cherishing the quality of grains.'

<span id="fn_765"></span>[156:2](sbe24078.htm#fr_773.md) The guardian
spirit or spiritual representative of each object created by
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, which acts for that object in the spiritual world (see
Mkh. XLIX, 23).

<span id="fn_766"></span>[157:1](sbe24078.htm#fr_774.md) Sans. has
'creatures.'

<span id="fn_767"></span>[157:2](sbe24078.htm#fr_775.md) See § 48.

<span id="fn_768"></span>[157:3](sbe24078.htm#fr_776.md) See §§ 46, 47.

<span id="fn_769"></span>[157:4](sbe24078.htm#fr_777.md) Assuming that Pâz.
far*z*înma*n*d (Sans. gumphita) stands for Pahl. par*k*în-hômand.

<span id="fn_770"></span>[157:5](sbe24078.htm#fr_778.md) Pâz. aw*e*fsûidan
(Sans. saṅko*k*ayitum); but it may be noted that the Pahlavi equivalent
of this word might be easily read apasa*g*agînî*d*anŏ, 'to disorganize.'

<span id="fn_771"></span>[158:1](sbe24078.htm#fr_779.md) From him, the evil
spirit, who is said to have left his native abyss and come on towards
the light, through the void which intervened (see Bd. I, 3-5,9).

<span id="fn_772"></span>[158:2](sbe24078.htm#fr_780.md) So in Pâz.-Sans.;
but 'he meditates' is more probable, and would be written in the same
manner in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_773"></span>[158:3](sbe24078.htm#fr_781.md) Perhaps referring
to the 'two series of things' mentioned in Chap. VI, 13-15, but the
connection is not very clear.

<span id="fn_774"></span>[158:4](sbe24078.htm#fr_782.md) Because
co-operation in complicated work tends towards division of labour.

<span id="fn_775"></span>[159:1](sbe24078.htm#fr_783.md) Sans. has 'others
give a reply;' but the Pâz. anyê, 'others,' is certainly a misreading of
Pahl. adîn aê, 'then this,' or adîna*s*, 'then to him,' in which latter
case the phrase would be 'then they *may* give a reply to him.' The
proper Pâzand for 'other' is awar*e* or han.

<span id="fn_776"></span>[159:2](sbe24078.htm#fr_784.md) See Chap. IV, 22
n.

<span id="fn_777"></span>[160:1](sbe24078.htm#fr_785.md) MH19 has 'to
maintain.'

<span id="fn_778"></span>[161:1](sbe24078.htm#fr_786.md) See § 95 n.

<span id="fn_779"></span>[161:2](sbe24078.htm#fr_787.md) Reading
adîna*s*a*s*, 'then its thereby' (with a double pronominal suffix),
which is the original Pahlavi indicated by Pâz. ainâ*s* (see Mkh. IX, 6
n).

<span id="fn_780"></span>[161:3](sbe24078.htm#fr_788.md) The archangel
'good thought,' who is said to hold the position and vanquish 'evil
thought,' while the angel Srôsh does the same as regards 'wrath' (see
Dînka*rd*, quoted in Dd. XCIV, 1 n; also Bd. XXX, 29).

<span id="fn_781"></span>[161:4](sbe24078.htm#fr_789.md) Sans. adds 'and
that man is called false,' which JE also inserts in Pâzand in the
margin, but all other manuscripts omit.

<span id="fn_782"></span>[162:1](sbe24078.htm#fr_790.md) Assuming that Pâz.
dâramaihâ (Sans. sûkshmatayâ) is a misreading of Pahl. garâmîkîhâ. It
would more easily be a misreading of sharmakîhâ, 'modestly,' but this
term seems rather less likely to be applied by the author to his
readers.
