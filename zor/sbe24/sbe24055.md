### CHAPTER XLIX.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: '*As to* these stars
which are apparent in the sky, and their number is so great, what is
then their duty and influence? 3. And how is the motion of the sun and
moon and stars?'

4\. The spirit of wisdom answered (5) thus: 'Of the stars which are in
the sky the first star is Tî*s*tar <span
id="fr_479"></span>[4](#fn_474), which is said *to be* great and good,
more valuable and more glorious <span id="fr_480"></span>[5](#fn_475).
6. And prosperity of every kind and the fertility of the world are in
the path of Tî*s*tar.

7, 8. 'And the star of water germs is for the increase of the star of
plant germs <span id="fr_481"></span>[6](#fn_476). 9, 10. And the star
of plant germs is for the increase of cattle germs <span
id="fr_482"></span>[7](#fn_477).

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 11. And water,
fire <span id="fr_483"></span>[1](#fn_478), plant, and cattle germs are
created for the increase of man germs <span
id="fr_484"></span>[2](#fn_479).

12\. 'And the star Vanand <span id="fr_485"></span>[3](#fn_480) is
intrusted with the passes *and* gates of Albûr*z* <span
id="fr_486"></span>[4](#fn_481); (13) so that the demons and witches and
fiends *may* turn from those gates and passes, (14) that *it may* not
*be* possible for them to cut off and break up the road and passage of
the sun and moon and stars <span id="fr_487"></span>[5](#fn_482).

15\. 'And the star Haptôk-ring <span id="fr_488"></span>[6](#fn_483),
with 99,999 guardian spirits of the righteous <span
id="fr_489"></span>[7](#fn_484), is intrusted with the gate and passage
of hell <span id="fr_490"></span>[8](#fn_485), (16) for the keeping

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

back of those 99,999 demons and fiends, witches and wizards, who are in
opposition to the *celestial* sphere and constellations *of the zodiac*.
17. Its motion, also, is round about hell; (18) and its special business
is this, as *it were* it holds the twelve signs of the zodiac by the
hand, in *their* proper going and corning. 19. And those twelve
constellations also proceed *in* like manner by the power and help of
Haptôk-ring <span id="fr_491"></span>[1](#fn_486); (20) and every single
constellation, when it comes in at Albûr*z*, provides support for
Haptôk-ring <span id="fr_492"></span>[2](#fn_487), (21) and begs
protection from Haptôk-ring.

22\. 'The remaining unnumbered and innumerable constellations <span
id="fr_493"></span>[3](#fn_488) which are apparent are said *to be* the
guardian spirits of the worldly *existences*. 23. Because, *as to* the
creatures and creations of every kind, that the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*
created for the worldly *existence*, which are procreative and also
which are developable (ârôdi*s*nîk) <span
id="fr_494"></span>[4](#fn_489), for every single body *there* is
apparent its own single guardian spirit of a like nature.

24\. 'And the motion of the sun and moon is the special illumination of
the world, (25) and the maturing of procreations and growths of all
kinds. 26. And the correct keeping of the day, month, and year, summer
and winter, spring and autumn, and other calculations and accounts of
all kinds which men ought to obtain, perceive, and understand, (27)

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

are more fully defined by means of the setting (ni*s*î*v*akŏ) <span
id="fr_495"></span>[1](#fn_490) of the sun and moon.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_474"></span>[90:4](sbe24055.htm#fr_479) Av. Ti*s*trya, the
eastern leader of the stars and special opponent of the planet Tîr
(Mercury), which can be identified only with Sirius. It is personified
as an angel who contends with the demon of drought and produces rain
(see Bd. II, 7, V, 1, VII, 1-13).

<span id="fn_475"></span>[90:5](sbe24055.htm#fr_480) The usual Avesta
epithets of Tî*s*tar are 'the radiant and glorious.'

<span id="fn_476"></span>[90:6](sbe24055.htm#fr_481) L19 has 'for the
increase of water. And the star of earth germs is for the increase of
earth.'

<span id="fn_477"></span>[90:7](sbe24055.htm#fr_482) L19 has 'for the
increase of plants. And the star of cattle germs is for the increase of
cattle.' The stars of water, earth, and plant germs are mentioned in the
formula of dedication to Tî*s*tar (Sîr. 13), and the moon is said to
possess the germs of cattle (Sîr. 12). <span id="page_91">p. 91</span>
Reference is also made to all of them in Rashnu Yt. 29-31, 33, and to
those of water germs in Vend. XXI, 33, Tî*s*tar Yt. 39, 45, 46.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[91:1](sbe24055.htm#fr_483) L19 has 'earth.'

<span id="fn_479"></span>[91:2](sbe24055.htm#fr_484) L19 has 'for the
increase of men.' As both the Pahlavi and Pâzand versions of §§ 7-11 are
complete and consistent in themselves, it is uncertain which of them
gives the original text. The Pâzand corresponds more closely to certain
passages in the Avesta, but a wish to produce such a correspondence may
have led Nêryôsang to alter the text. That the Pahlavi writer was
thinking of some other passage, as yet unidentified, is evident from the
omission of the star Satavês (which follows Tî*s*tar in Sîr. 13) and
from the details he gives concerning the others.

<span id="fn_480"></span>[91:3](sbe24055.htm#fr_485) The southern leader
of the stars and special opponent of the planet Aûha*r*ma*zd* (Jupiter),
which is perhaps best identified with Fomalhaut (see Bd. II, 7, V, 1).
The Avesta mentions it in connection with Tî*s*tar (Sîr. 13).

<span id="fn_481"></span>[91:4](sbe24055.htm#fr_486) See Chap. XLIV, 16
n.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[91:5](sbe24055.htm#fr_487) Which are supposed
to rise and set through openings or passes in the mountain range of
Albûr*z*, which encircles the world (see Bd. V, 5).

<span id="fn_483"></span>[91:6](sbe24055.htm#fr_488) Av. Haptôiri*n*ga,
the northern leader of the stars and special opponent of the planet
Vâhrâm (Mars), which corresponds to Ursa Major (see Bd. II, 7, V, 1).
The Avesta mentions it, in connection with the other stars named in the
text, in Sîr. 13.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[91:7](sbe24055.htm#fr_489) See Fravar*d*in Yt.
60. The number here mentioned is that generally used in the Avesta to
express an indefinitely large number.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[91:8](sbe24055.htm#fr_490) Which is supposed
to be in the north, so that the circumpolar <span id="page_93">p.
93</span> constellation of Ursa Major seems to revolve around it, and to
remain on the watch.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[92:1](sbe24055.htm#fr_491) Written Haptâôrig
in §§19-21 in K43.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[92:2](sbe24055.htm#fr_492) L19 has 'holds to
Haptôk-ring by the hand.'

<span id="fn_488"></span>[92:3](sbe24055.htm#fr_493) L19 has 'stars.'

<span id="fn_489"></span>[92:4](sbe24055.htm#fr_494) L19 has azâi*s*nî,
'unprocreative.'

<span id="fn_490"></span>[93:1](sbe24055.htm#fr_495) Nêr. reads vah*ez*a
and translates 'new year's day.'
