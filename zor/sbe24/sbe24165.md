### CHAPTER LXXVII.

1\. The seventy-seventh subject is this, that, when a woman's infant is
still-born, it is necessary to give *her* first something washed with
ceremony *and* brought *with* fire-ashes <span
id="fr_1489"></span>[3](#fn_1478.md), so that it *may* make the heart
within her pure. 2. After that, *for* three days, it is altogether
improper to give *her* water, *or* anything in which *there* is water or
salt. 3. And these three days are from period to period <span
id="fr_1490"></span>[4](#fn_1479.md), *in* such a

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

manner that, if the duty of mid-day <span
id="fr_1491"></span>[1](#fn_1480.md) prayer has occurred, they extend till
the mid-day prayer itself, *and she is* to pass over one other hour
*and* it is *then* proper to swallow water. 4. After that, till the
lapse of forty days, *she is* to sit apart again, and, afterwards, to
undergo the Bareshnûm *ceremony* <span
id="fr_1492"></span>[2](#fn_1481.md).

5\. *On* the infant's becoming a four-months’ *child*, whenever it is
*still-*born it is a dead *body* <span
id="fr_1493"></span>[3](#fn_1482.md), for the reason that so long as it
does not reach the fourth month life does not come to it. 6. And if
after three months this affair occurs, *one is* to exercise great
caution (i‘htiyâ*t*) and to insist strictly on this matter.

7\. For our religion has reiterated on this matter that, if *one* be
polluted and do not keep himself pure, so long as he is living he never
becomes clean from that pollution. 8. That, if he wash *his* head ten
thousand times in *ceremonial* ablution, he certainly does not any *way*
become pure from it <span id="fr_1494"></span>[4](#fn_1483.md). 9. Because
this pollution is not from without; it is from within every bone and
vein and tendon; *and* water makes clean *only* anything that is on the
skin. 10. Impurity which is *in* the bones, except *through the liquid
consecrated by* the religious formula <span
id="fr_1495"></span>[5](#fn_1484.md), does not otherwise become clean.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1476"></span>[340:1](sbe24164.htm#fr_1487.md) Only B29 and the
Gu*g*arâti have 'a second.'

<span id="fn_1477"></span>[340:2](sbe24164.htm#fr_1488.md) B29 omits these
twelve words.

<span id="fn_1478"></span>[340:3](sbe24165.htm#fr_1489.md) So in B29, which
agrees with Vend. VII, 163, but La, Lp are defective. The 'something'
means consecrated bull's urine, as in Chap. LXXIV, 1; this, mingled with
ashes, is prescribed as the first thing to be tasted by the woman.

<span id="fn_1479"></span>[340:4](sbe24165.htm#fr_1490.md) That is, from
the given hour to the same hour on the third day, although, from what
follows, it appears that, if the given hour were in the middle of any
period of the day, the third day would expire at the beginning of the
third similar period. Whether the three days are to be inclusive, or
exclusive, of the day when the term begins, that is, whether the term is
to be nearly 48 or 72 hours, is not very clear.

<span id="fn_1480"></span>[341:1](sbe24165.htm#fr_1491.md) Literally
'former, early.'

<span id="fn_1481"></span>[341:2](sbe24165.htm#fr_1492.md) See Chap. XXXVI,
1 n.

<span id="fn_1482"></span>[341:3](sbe24165.htm#fr_1493.md) And, therefore,
to be treated with all the precautions necessary in dealing with a
corpse to avoid the pollution alluded to in §§ 710. Hence the necessity
of careful enquiry in doubtful cases, as recommended in § 6.

<span id="fn_1483"></span>[341:4](sbe24165.htm#fr_1494.md) B29 omits § 8.

<span id="fn_1484"></span>[341:5](sbe24165.htm#fr_1495.md) See Chap. XXXVI,
7 n.
