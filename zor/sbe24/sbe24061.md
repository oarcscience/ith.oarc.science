### CHAPTER LV.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Wherefore is he who
is an ill-natured man no friend of the good, *nor* an untalented man of
a talented *one?*'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'For this reason, because he
who is an ill-talented <span id="fr_519"></span>[2](#fn_512.md) man is *at*
\[all\] <span id="fr_520"></span>[3](#fn_513.md) times *in* fear of the
talented, (5) lest "they should trouble <span
id="fr_521"></span>[4](#fn_514.md) us by *their* skill and talent, and,
owing to that circumstance, shame *may* come upon *us* before the good
and *our* opponents."

6\. 'And the ill-natured are no friends of the good for this reason,
because *there* is a time for their annihilation and destruction by the
hands of the good.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_512"></span>[97:2](sbe24061.htm#fr_519.md) L19 has
'untalented.'

<span id="fn_513"></span>[97:3](sbe24061.htm#fr_520.md) K43 omits 'all,'
and its text may be translated thus:—'because the position of him who is
an ill-talented man is in danger from the talented.'

<span id="fn_514"></span>[97:4](sbe24061.htm#fr_521.md) Reading aê
ran*g*ênd. Nêr. has the doubtful reading airô*z*ine*n*d, 'they
enlighten,' and also several other variations, so as to produce the
following meaning:—'lest "these enlighten *others* by the skill and
talent which are not mine," and shame come upon him before the good and
*his* helpmates.'
