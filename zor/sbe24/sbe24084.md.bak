### CHAPTER XIV.

1\. My desire is also that I write a story (nisang-1) out of the
accompanying inconsistency and full delusion of the same scripture, (2)
that is full of every iniquity and demonism; and I *will* disclose a
summary of one *part* out of a thousand of *what is* declared thereby,
(3) *so as* to notice the commands therein.

4\. First, this is what he says about his own nature, (5) that is, 'I am
the Lord, seeking vengeance (6) and retaliating vengeance <span
id="fr_967"></span>[1](#fn_959), (7.md) and I retaliate vengeance sevenfold
upon the children <span id="fr_968"></span>[2](#fn_960), (8.md) and *one*
does not forget my original vengeance.' (9). Another place states that,
'*having* acquired <span id="fr_969"></span>[3](#fn_961.md) wrath and
grievous thoughts, (10) his lips are also full of indignation <span
id="fr_970"></span>[4](#fn_962), (11.md) *his* tongue is like a blazing
fire, (12) and *his* breath (vâyâ) is like a river of rapid water
(arvand nâk) <span id="fr_971"></span>[5](#fn_963.md). 13. His voice, too,
as though for causing

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

weeping, is more resembling the shouting of a demon <span
id="fr_972"></span>[1](#fn_964), (14.md) and his seat is in the gloom <span
id="fr_973"></span>[2](#fn_965.md), the dew, and the cloud <span
id="fr_974"></span>[3](#fn_966.md). 15. His charger, also, is the drying
(khû*s*kâk) wind <span id="fr_975"></span>[4](#fn_967), (16.md) and from
the motion of his feet is the arising of a whirlwind of dust <span
id="fr_976"></span>[5](#fn_968.md). 17. When he walks the arising of fire
is behind him <span id="fr_977"></span>[6](#fn_969.md).

18\. And, elsewhere, he speaks about his own wrathfulness, (19) thus: 'I
have been forty years in wrath about the Israelites <span
id="fr_978"></span>[7](#fn_970),' (20.md) and he said that the Israelites
are defiled in heart <span id="fr_979"></span>[8](#fn_971.md).

21\. Elsewhere he speaks thus: 'Who is blind <span
id="fr_980"></span>[9](#fn_972.md),

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

unless *it be* my servant? 22. Who is deaf <span
id="fr_981"></span>[1](#fn_973), but the messenger (firîstak.md) I am
appointing? 23. Who is blind like the king <span
id="fr_982"></span>[2](#fn_974.md)?' *And it is* declared that their king
is the Lord himself <span id="fr_983"></span>[3](#fn_975.md).

24\. Elsewhere it also says this, that the worshippers (parastakân) of
his fire are defiled <span id="fr_984"></span>[4](#fn_976.md). 25. Also
this, that his deeds bring blinding smoke, (26) *and his* fighting is
the shedding of blood <span id="fr_985"></span>[5](#fn_977.md). 27. And
this, that is, 'I pour forth mankind one upon the other, (28) *and* I
sit upon the sky, over their limbs.' 29. Likewise this, that, in one
night, a hundred *and* sixty thousand *were* slain by him, through a
wretched death, out of the champions and troops of the Mâzerdarâns <span
id="fr_986"></span>[6](#fn_978.md). 30. And, *on* another occasion, he slew
six hundred thousand men, besides women and young children, out of the
Israelites in the wilderness; (31) only two men escaped <span
id="fr_987"></span>[7](#fn_979.md).

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

32\. Again, it shows that his final result is all regret, (33) just as
this which it states, that he became among the despondent (zardakân),
and he spoke thus: 'I am repentant as to the making of men on the
earth <span id="fr_988"></span>[1](#fn_980.md).'

34\. This, too, it states, that he sits upon a throne which four angels
hold upon *their* wings, from each one of whom a fiery river always
proceeds, owing to the load of *his* weight <span
id="fr_989"></span>[2](#fn_981.md). 35. Now, when he is a spirit, not
formed with a body, why then are those four distressed by him, who
*have* to sustain with toil the grievous load of that easy *thing?*

36\. Again, *it states* this, that every day he prepares, with his own
hand, ninety thousand worshippers, and they always worship him until he
night time, and then he dismisses them, through a fiery river, to
hell <span id="fr_990"></span>[3](#fn_982.md). 37. When trouble and
injustice of this description are seen, how is it

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

expedient *for* worldly beings to exist in duty, good works, and good
deeds? 38. When he casts distressed worshippers who are reverent,
listening to commands, *and* pure in action, together with others *who
are* sinners, into eternal hell, (39) *it is* like even that which
another congregation <span id="fr_991"></span>[1](#fn_983.md) asserts, that
the sacred being, *at* the day of the resurrection, gives the sun and
moon, together with others *who are* sinners, to hell for the reason
that there are people who *have* offered homage to them.

40\. Another place also states this, that when the eyes of the aged
(masâtval) <span id="fr_992"></span>[2](#fn_984.md) Abraham, who *was* the
friend of the Lord, were afflicted, the Lord himself came enquiring for
him; (41) and he sat *on* his cushion and asked for peace <span
id="fr_993"></span>[3](#fn_985.md). 42. And Abraham called Isaac <span
id="fr_994"></span>[4](#fn_986.md), who *was* his dearest son <span
id="fr_995"></span>[5](#fn_987), in secret, *and* spoke (43.md) thus: 'Go
to paradise (vahi*s*t), *and* bring wine that is light and pure.' 44.
*And* he went and brought it. 45. And Abraham made many entreaties to
the Lord (46) thus: 'Taste one time <span
id="fr_996"></span>[6](#fn_988.md) wine in my abode.' 47. *And* the Lord
spoke thus:

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'I *will* not
taste *it*, because *it* is not from paradise, and is not pure.' 48.
Then Abraham gave assurance thus: 'The wine is pure from paradise, and
Isaac, who is my son, brought *it*.' 49. Thereupon the Lord, *on account
of* his freedom from doubt in Isaac, and the assurance *given* by
Abraham, tasted the wine one time. 50. Afterwards, when he wished to go,
*he was* not allowed until one of them *had* sworn *to* the other by a
serious oath <span id="fr_997"></span>[1](#fn_989.md).

51\. Observe this twaddle full of delusion; not even a single *detail*
is adapted to a sacred being. 52. In what way *was* his coming in bodily
form to the abode of Abraham and eating bread, of which not even a
single *detail* is adapted to him? 53. This, too, is evident, from it,
that the suffering of Abraham was not <span
id="fr_998"></span>[2](#fn_990.md) from the Lord, but from another
producer. 54. And even the faultiness <span
id="fr_999"></span>[3](#fn_991.md) which *was* owing to his want of
understanding of knowledge was such, that the purity of the wine and
whence *it came* were not known by him. 55. His falsity is also *seen
in* this, when he spoke of not drinking the wine, and *at* last drank
*it*. 56. Afterwards he is confessing that it is genuine *and* pure. 57.
Now, how is he worthy of worship, as a divinity that is all-knowing
*and* almighty, whose nature is this?

58\. And another place states that *there* was one of the sick who, with
his own wife and child, *was*

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

particularly *one* that was suffering, poor, *and* without a stipend.
59. *At* all times he was very diligent and active in prayer and fasting
and the worship of the sacred being. 60. And one day, in prayer, he
secretly begged a favour thus: 'Give me any enjoyment that is in daily
food (rô*z*îh), (61) that it may be easier for me to live.'

62\. And an angel came down unto him *and* spoke thus: 'The sacred being
has not allotted thee, through the constellations <span
id="fr_1000"></span>[1](#fn_992), more daily food than this, (63.md) *and*
it is not possible to allot anew; (64) but, as a recompense for worship
*and* prayer, a throne whose four feet are of jewels is appointed for
thee in heaven (vahi*s*t) by me, (65) *and*, if it be necessary, I
*will* give unto thee one foot of that throne.'

66\. That exalter of the apostles enquired of his own wife, (67) *and*
the unfortunate *one* spoke thus: '*It is* better for us to be content
with the scanty daily food and bad living in the worldly *existence*,
(68) than if our throne, among *our* companions in heaven, *had* three
feet; (69) but if it may occur to thee then appoint us a day's food by
another mode.'

70\. *At* the second coming of that angel he spoke thus: 'But if I
dissipate the *celestial* sphere, and produce the sky *and* earth anew,
and construct and produce the motion of the stars anew, *still*
thenceforth *it* is not clear whether thy destiny *will* fall *out* good
or bad <span id="fr_1001"></span>[2](#fn_993.md).'

71\. From this statement *it* is, therefore, manifest that he is not
himself the appointer of daily food and supreme, (72) distribution is
not by his will,

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

*he is* not able to alter destiny, (73) and the revolution of the
*celestial* sphere, the sun *and* moon and stars, is not within the
compass of his knowledge, will, and command. 74. *And* also this, that
the throne, as to which *it was* announced (nivîkînî*d*) thus: 'I *will*
give *it* in heaven,' is not of his formation and creation.

75\. And *in* another place he speaks about his own twaddle (76) thus:
'I *have* slain, *in* one day <span id="fr_1002"></span>[1](#fn_994.md), an
assemblage (ram) of sinners, as well as innumerable innocents.' 77.
*And* when the angels talked much of the unreasonable performance, he
then spoke of it thus: 'I am the Lord, the ruler of wills, (78)
superintending, unrivalled, and doing *my own* will, and no one assists
*or* is to utter a murmur (dren*g*i*s*nŏ) about me <span
id="fr_1003"></span>[2](#fn_995.md).'

79\. Especially abundant is the twaddle that is completely delusive,
which *has* seemed to me tedious to write. 80. Whoever would investigate
the backward opinions of these statements, should be, for that purpose
of his, a high-priest speaking candidly (â*z*â*d*), (81) until he
becomes aware of the nature of the same scripture, and *of* the truth of
that which is stated by me.

82\. Now if he *be* a sacred being, of whom these are signs and tokens,
that *implies that* truth is far from him, (83) forgiveness strange to
him, (84) and knowledge is not bestowed upon him. 85. Because this
itself is the fiend who is leader of the hell which

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

is the den (grêstak) of the gloomy race, (86) whom the devilish defiled
*ones and* evil *people* glorify by the name of the Lord, and offer
*him* homage.

87\. About this subject is here complete.

<span id="fn_963"></span>[221:5](sbe24084.htm#fr_971.md) 'Behold, the name
of the Lord cometh from far, burning *with* his anger, and the burden

<span id="fn_965"></span>[222:2](sbe24084.htm#fr_973.md) Assuming that Pâz.
gûam (Pers. gum, 'invisible') is a misreading of Pahl. tom, 'gloom,' as
the Sanskrit is dhûmalatvam, 'smokiness.'

<span id="fn_966"></span>[222:3](sbe24084.htm#fr_974.md) 'He made darkness
his secret place: his pavilion round about him *were* dark waters *and*
thick clouds of the skies' (Ps. xviii. 11). 'Clouds and darkness *are*

Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to
render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire' (Is.
lxvi. 15).

<span id="fn_970"></span>[222:7](sbe24084.htm#fr_978.md) Pâz. Asarâsarã is
evidently a misreading of Pahl. Asrâyîlân.

<span id="fn_971"></span>[222:8](sbe24084.htm#fr_979.md) 'Forty years long
was I grieved with *this* generation, and said, "It *is* a people that
do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways;" unto whom I
sware in my wrath, that they should not enter into my rest' (Ps. xcv.
10, 11).

<span id="fn_972"></span>[222:9](sbe24084.htm#fr_980.md) Sans. has 'whoever
is needy,' both here and in § 23.

<span id="fn_973"></span>[223:1](sbe24084.htm#fr_981.md) Sans. has 'whoever
is prosperous.'

<span id="fn_974"></span>[223:2](sbe24084.htm#fr_982.md) 'Who *is* blind,
but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger *that* I sent? who *is* blind
as *he that is* perfect, and blind as the Lord's servant?' (Is. xlii.
19).

<span id="fn_975"></span>[223:3](sbe24084.htm#fr_983.md) 'The Lord *is* our
king' (Is. xxxiii. 22).

<span id="fn_976"></span>[223:4](sbe24084.htm#fr_984.md) 'About five and
twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the Lord, and their
faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east. Then
he said unto me, "Hast thou seen *this*, O son of man? Is it a light
thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they
commit here?"' (Eze. viii. 16, 17).

<span id="fn_977"></span>[223:5](sbe24084.htm#fr_985.md) 'And when Joshua
and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the
smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of
Ai' (Jos. viii. 21).

<span id="fn_978"></span>[223:6](sbe24084.htm#fr_986.md) 'Then the angel of
the Lord went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred
and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the
morning, behold, they were all dead corpses' (Is. xxxvii. 36).

<span id="fn_979"></span>[223:7](sbe24084.htm#fr_987.md) 'And the children
of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand
on foot, *that were* men, beside <span id="page_224">p. 224</span>
children' (Ex. xii. 37). 'Doubtless ye shall not come into the land
*concerning* which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son
of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. . . . But *as for* you, your
carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness' (Num. xiv. 30, 30.

<span id="fn_980"></span>[224:1](sbe24084.htm#fr_988.md) 'And it repented
the Lord that he had made man on the earth' (Gen. vi. 6).

<span id="fn_981"></span>[224:2](sbe24084.htm#fr_989.md) 'Also out of the
midst thereof *came* the likeness of four living creatures. . . . Their
wings *were* joined one to another. . . . As for the likeness of the
living creatures, their appearance *was* like burning coals of fire,
*and* like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living
creatures. . . . And under the firmament *were* their wings straight,
the one toward the other. . . . And above the firmament that *was* over
their heads *was* the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a
sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne *was* the likeness
as the appearance of a man above upon it' (Eze. i. 5, 9, 13, 23, 26). 'A
fiery stream issued and came forth from before him' (Dan. vii. 10).

<span id="fn_982"></span>[224:3](sbe24084.htm#fr_990.md) This statement may
possibly be quoted from the Talmud.

<span id="fn_983"></span>[225:1](sbe24084.htm#fr_991.md) Probably the
Christians, and referring to such texts as 'The sun shall be turned into
darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of
the Lord come' (Acts ii. 20).

<span id="fn_984"></span>[225:2](sbe24084.htm#fr_992.md) Nêr. reads this
word as a title, Mehâdar, of Abraham. It is, however, the Huzvâri*s* of
dâ*d*-mas (for dâ*d*-î mas, 'great age'), and appears to be a hybrid
form, the first syllable being Iranian and the latter portion Semitic.

<span id="fn_985"></span>[225:3](sbe24084.htm#fr_993.md) Upon his host; the
usual Oriental salutation.

<span id="fn_986"></span>[225:4](sbe24084.htm#fr_994.md) Nêr. has read
Âsînak, which indicates a Pahlavi form that might be read Aîsôk, and
points to Syr. ’Îs‘hoq as the original of this form of Isaac.

<span id="fn_987"></span>[225:5](sbe24084.htm#fr_995.md) Sans. has 'his
whole-blood brother's son.'

<span id="fn_988"></span>[225:6](sbe24084.htm#fr_996.md) Assuming that Pâz.
shê stands for Pahl. gâs-1, both here and in § 49. Nêr. seems to have
understood it as Ar. *s*ay, 'somewhat.'

<span id="fn_989"></span>[226:1](sbe24084.htm#fr_997.md) This tale is
perhaps to be sought in the Talmud.

<span id="fn_990"></span>[226:2](sbe24084.htm#fr_998.md) Reading lâ instead
of râî. By reading the latter Nêr. has 'the suffering, which *was* for
Abraham, was from the Lord,' which is inconsistent with the context.

<span id="fn_991"></span>[226:3](sbe24084.htm#fr_999.md) Assuming that Pâz.
bavãnî (Sans. vaikalyam) stands for Pahl. zîfânîh, which seems more
probable than supposing it to be a miswriting of Pâz. d*e*wãnagî,
'folly.'

<span id="fn_992"></span>[227:1](sbe24084.htm#fr_1000.md) Of the zodiac
(see Mkh. XII, 5, 6, 8).

<span id="fn_993"></span>[227:2](sbe24084.htm#fr_1001.md) This tale is
probably from the same source as the last.

<span id="fn_994"></span>[228:1](sbe24084.htm#fr_1002.md) Assuming that
Pâz. zumaê is a corruption of *g*umê (see Chap. IV, 101 n) and stands
for Huz. yôm-1. But it may mean 'the whole of.'

<span id="fn_995"></span>[228:2](sbe24084.htm#fr_1003.md) This seems to be
quoted from the same source as the two preceding tales.
