### CHAPTER IX.

1\. Other information about the existence of the competitor, similarly
testified by the Dînka*rd* <span id="fr_791"></span>[2](#fn_783.md)
manuscript (nipîk), is here well noted for you. 2. For both this *which
is* written above and that which is written *here* are all grown from
the seed which the glorified Âtûr-pâ*d*îyâvand sowed, (3) and *from* the
original thanksgiving (spâs) of the supremely learned Âtû*r*-frôbag, son
of Farukh-zâ*d*, himself.

4\. The fourth <span id="fr_792"></span>[3](#fn_784.md) subject, which is
from the Dînka*rd*, is about the existence of an opponent of the
creatures and of an opponent earlier than the creatures, and is from the
exposition of the good religion <span id="fr_793"></span>[4](#fn_785.md).

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

5\. *That* is, a knowledge of the existence of an opponent of the
creatures is obtainable from the innermost *recesses* of the body of man
even to the outermost *objects* of which <span
id="fr_794"></span>[1](#fn_786) sight is susceptible, (6.md) and beyond
those, within the certain limits of analogy. 7. The innermost *recesses*
of man are the innermost of life, (8) *and* are seen through complete
observation, within the same limits.

9\. This is, as ignorance is to erudition, (10) deceit to good
disposition, (11) and falsehood to truth, (12) other defects of the
capabilities which are the source of erudition, good disposition, and
truth are the opponent, (13) and the cause of the wickedness of the
soul. 14. Again, these irregularities of the rules of arrangement of the
body, within the compass of the body, are the opponent, and the cause of
the disintegration of the body. 15. Again, *as to* these among the
emanations, cold is the opponent of heat, dryness is of moisture, *and*
the other doers of mischief are *opponents* of the operations of
existence.

16\. Within time darkness is the opponent of light, stench of perfume,
ugliness of handsomeness, unsavouriness of savouriness, poison of *its*
antidote, noxious creatures and the wolf of the well-yielding cattle,
*and* the vile felon (mar) of the good man. 17. Beyond time the brigand
*planets* (gadûgân) <span id="fr_795"></span>[2](#fn_787.md) are the
opponents of the work of the divine bestowers.

18\. Beyond the knowledge obtainable of all these

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

champions susceptible to sight, are those who are within the limits of
analogy <span id="fr_796"></span>[1](#fn_788.md) and the certain
information of multitudes, the demons who are the opponents of the
sacred beings.

19\. The existence of an opponent before the creation of the creatures,
and his coming to the creatures (20) after, the creation of the
creatures, *and* also to the creator, are presented comprehensibly
through reasons which are suitable <span id="fr_797"></span>[2](#fn_789.md)
*and* presentable, *and* through the provision of a remedy, a creation
which is for a purpose. 21. This one statement (vâ*k*ak) possesses five
arguments (sâmân). 22. One is the *being* presented comprehensibly. 23.
One is the *being* presented through reasons. 24. One is the reasons
which are presentable *and* suitable that the creation existed. 25. One
is the remedy appointed for the creation. 26. *And* one is the creation
of the creatures of the creator for a purpose.

27\. The existence of these five arguments is manifest through the
creations *and* achievements themselves. 28. The presenting
comprehensibly is wisely arranging the testimony of the effect <span
id="fr_798"></span>[3](#fn_790) of the creatures, (29.md) through the
reasons presented, which are a declaration owing to the same sagacity.
30. The reason obtainable, that the creation existed, (31) with the
arrangement of the creation so methodically, ought to arise from the
suitable *state* of the

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

creation; (32) and the suitable design of the creation itself possesses
the testimony, through *its* appearance. 33. The remedy appointed is a
comprehensible *and* presentable demonstrator, (34) because it becomes a
desire of knowledge and an appearance of the desire. 35. The *being*
created for a purpose is manifest through the desire of activity of the
creation, both severally and naturally.

36\. The evidences of the existence of an opponent before the creation
of the creatures are many. 37. And one of them is the suitable *state*
of the creation of the creatures, (38) because the limit of suitability
is not well fitted for anything except necessity. (39) That *which* is
*inferred* from suitability is necessity, from necessity haste, *and*
from haste the existence of an opponent who is before the suitable work
which is the creation.

40\. The evidence of the coming of the destroyer to the creatures, after
the creation of the creatures, is the formation of the means of the
creator, for encountering an opponent, before the arrival of the
opponent, (41) which are omnisciently a provision before creation by the
creator. 42. And there is a demonstrator of *these* same means of the
creatures that is prepared, which is the struggling opposed to the
opponent through the arrangement of *their* nature. 43. One duty of the
nature of the creatures is the subduing of so much vexation. 44. Their
preparation, too, is like a contest that is forming an enemy opposing
the opponent, (45) and their natural desire for duty is removing all
haste.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_783"></span>[162:2](sbe24079.htm#fr_791.md) See Chap. IV, 106,
107 for the names in these §§ 1, 2.

<span id="fn_784"></span>[162:3](sbe24079.htm#fr_792.md) Assuming that Pâz.
ardium (Sans. balish*th*o me) is a misreading of Pahl. arbâûm. The first
subject (see Chap: II, 1) consisted of the three questions of
Mit*r*ô-aîyyâr discussed in Chaps. II-IV. The second subject, about the
existence of God, is contained in Chaps. V, VI. And the third subject,
about the existence of an evil spirit competing with the creator, is
debated in Chaps. VII, VIII.

<span id="fn_785"></span>[162:4](sbe24079.htm#fr_793.md) The third book of
the Dînka*rd*, which treats of a multitude of subjects 'from the
exposition of the good religion,' does not appear <span id="page_163">p.
163</span> to contain the materials for this chapter. The author is,
therefore, probably alluding to one of the two earlier books which have
not yet been discovered.

<span id="fn_786"></span>[163:1](sbe24079.htm#fr_794.md) Assuming that Pâz.
a*n*dâ n*e* (for b*e*) thûm-i va*s* (Sans. yâvat bî*g*am asya) stands
for Pahl. vad ba*r*âtûm-î a*g*a*s*.

<span id="fn_787"></span>[163:2](sbe24079.htm#fr_795.md) See Chap. IV, 10.

<span id="fn_788"></span>[164:1](sbe24079.htm#fr_796.md) Referring to the
two kinds of evidence, direct and indirect, mentioned in §§ 5, 6.

<span id="fn_789"></span>[164:2](sbe24079.htm#fr_797.md) So in § 24 and in
Sans., though Pâz. has 'obtainable' here.

<span id="fn_790"></span>[164:3](sbe24079.htm#fr_798.md) Assuming that the
Pâz. awar dugâê of AK stands for Pahl. bar gôkâs (or gôkâsîh). MH19 has
duvâê, and PB3, JE have dusâê, while Sans. means 'about the magnitude.'
