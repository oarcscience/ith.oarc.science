### CHAPTER XXXIII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: '*As to* a ruler <span
id="fr_374"></span>[2](#fn_369), (3) a chieftain, (4) a friend, (5) a
kinsman, (6) a wife, (7) a child, (8) and a country, which is the
worse?'

9\. The spirit of wisdom answered (it)) thus: 'That ruler is the worse,
that is not able to keep the country unalarmed, and the people
untroubled. 11. That chieftain is the worse, who is defective in
ability, unthankful unto agents (ka*rd*ârân), and no helper and
interceder for a servant (a*s*âk) <span id="fr_375"></span>[3](#fn_370).
12. That friend is the worse, who is not fit to be relied upon. 13. That
kinsman is the worse, who is no helper in illness (khastânak) <span
id="fr_376"></span>[4](#fn_371). 14. That wife is the worse, with whom
it is not possible to live with pleasure. 15. That child . is the worse,
who is no bringer of renown. 16. And that country is the worse, in which
it is not possible to live in happiness, fearlessness, and permanence.'
