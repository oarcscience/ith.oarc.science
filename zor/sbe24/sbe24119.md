### CHAPTER XXXI.

1\. The thirty-first subject is this, that, every time they eat bread,
it is necessary to withhold three morsels from their own bodies, and to
give *them* to a dog. 2. And it is not desirable to beat a dog. 3. For,
of the poor no one whatever is poorer than

a dog, *and* it is necessary to give a tethered *animal* bread, because
the good work is great.

4\. And in revelation it is declared in this manner, that, if a dog is
asleep upon the road, it is not proper that they put a foot violently on
the ground, so that he becomes awake. 5. And, in former times, an
allowance (râtib) of bread would have been made every day for the sake
of the dogs, three times in summer *and* twice in winter, on this
account, that *one* wishes *them* to come to the assistance of his soul
at the *K*inva*d* bridge.

6\. In the worldly *existence* they are the guard of men and cattle. 7.
If *there* had not been a dog they would not have been able to keep a
single sheep. 8. Every time that he barks, just as his bark goes forth,
the demons and fiends run away from the place.
