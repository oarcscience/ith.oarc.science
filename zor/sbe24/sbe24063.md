### CHAPTER LVII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Wherefore *is it*
when the knowledge and sagacity of the spiritual and worldly
*existences*, both united, are connected with thee?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'For this reason, because,
from the first, I, who am the innate wisdom, *apart* from the spiritual
and worldly existences, have been with Aûha*r*ma*zd*. 5. And

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd* created (âfrî*d*ŏ) the angels of the spiritual
and worldly creations, and all the other creatures and creations through
the power and mightiness, the wisdom and sagacity of innate wisdom; and
I produce <span id="fr_525"></span>[1](#fn_518) and he maintains and
stimulates *them*. 6. And at the end of the renovation *of the universe*
it is possible to cause the annihilation and destruction of Aharman and
his miscreations more fully by the power of wisdom; (7) and
Sôshâns <span id="fr_526"></span>[2](#fn_519), with Kaî-Khûsrôî <span
id="fr_527"></span>[2](#fn_519), and those who the resurrection and
future existence are able to act more fully, by means of the power and
help of wisdom.

8\. 'The knowledge and sagacity of the worldly *existence*, the learning
and teaching in <span id="fr_528"></span>[3](#fn_520) every profession,
and all advancement of temporal *beings* <span
id="fr_529"></span>[4](#fn_521) are through wisdom: 9. The souls of the
righteous, in escaping from hell <span id="fr_530"></span>[5](#fn_522)
and coming <span id="fr_531"></span>[6](#fn_523) to heaven and the
supreme heaven (garô*d*mân), arrive much better by means of the power
and protection of wisdom. 10. And it is possible to seek the good
living, pleasure, good repute, and every happiness of people in the
worldly *existence*, through the power of wisdom.

11\. 'And the maintenance of the seeds of men

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

and beasts *of burden*, oxen and sheep, and also every other creature
and creation of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the lord, the seating <span
id="fr_532"></span>[1](#fn_524) *of them* in the womb, and making
manifest what is their food in the womb, so that they shall not die from
hunger and thirst, and the allotment and maturing of the limbs are
effected <span id="fr_533"></span>[2](#fn_525) more fully by means of
the durability (dôrângarîh) and great potency which are in the
force <span id="fr_534"></span>[3](#fn_526) of wisdom.

12\. 'The arrangement of the earth and the mingling of the water in the
earth, the growth and increase of plants, colour of various kinds, and
the scent, taste, and pleasantness of various things are allotted and
produced more fully through wisdom. 13. And the arrangement of
Albûr*z* <span id="fr_535"></span>[4](#fn_527) around the world, the
manifestation of the earth of the seven regions <span
id="fr_536"></span>[5](#fn_528) and the sky above the mountain of
Albûr*z*, the motion of the sun and moon and twelve constellations <span
id="fr_537"></span>[6](#fn_529), the six times of the season festivals
(gâsanbâr) <span id="fr_538"></span>[7](#fn_530). the five times
*devoted* to the guardian spirits (fravar*d*îkân) <span
id="fr_539"></span>[8](#fn_531), the heaven which is in the place of
good thoughts, the place of good words, the place of good deeds, and the
perfect supreme

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

heaven (garô*d*mân) of all gloriousness <span
id="fr_540"></span>[1](#fn_532), the path of the spirits and worldly
*existences*, and the *K*indvar bridge <span
id="fr_541"></span>[2](#fn_533) are produced and allotted through the
power of wisdom.

14\. 'The watery-looking <span id="fr_542"></span>[3](#fn_534) cloud's
seizing water from the sea, advancing in the atmosphere, and gradually
breaking away <span id="fr_543"></span>[4](#fn_535), drop by drop, to
the earth, and Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s <span id="fr_544"></span>[5](#fn_536)
creatures’ thoroughly understanding the nature of heaven and hell, the
compassion of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the archangels, and other angels as regards
their own creatures, and the devastation and destructiveness of Aharman
and the demons as regards the creatures of Aûha*r*ma*zd* it is possible
to comprehend through the more complete power <span
id="fr_545"></span>[6](#fn_537) of wisdom. 15. And the good religion of
the Ma*zd*a-worshippers, the sayings and teaching of the spirits <span
id="fr_546"></span>[7](#fn_538), and the demons’ demolishing the worldly
body *and* making *it* imperceptible by the sight of men are
apprehended <span id="fr_547"></span>[8](#fn_539) more fully by means of
the most perfect means of wisdom. 16. And even the struggle and warfare
of Irân with foreigners (an-aîrân), and the smiting of Aharman and the
demons it is possible to effect through the power of wisdom.

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

17\. 'To occasion the sun's inspection of the hidden water also, below
the earth, it is expedient to convey *it* for tillage and cultivation,
and the advantage, comfort, and enjoyment of men and beasts of burden,
oxen and sheep, through the power of wisdom. 18. The thorough
understanding of the pain and sickness of men and beasts *of burden*,
oxen, sheep, and other animals, and the bringing of medicine and
remedies, health of body and comfort unto them are much more possible to
effect <span id="fr_548"></span>[1](#fn_540) by means of the power of
wisdom.

19\. 'And *as to* every man whose participation in wisdom is. much, his
share of heaven is then much more. 20. Even *as to* Vi*s*tâsp <span
id="fr_549"></span>[2](#fn_541), Zaratû*s*t <span
id="fr_550"></span>[3](#fn_542), Gâyômar*d* <span
id="fr_551"></span>[4](#fn_543), and those others whose share of heaven
was much the more <span id="fr_552"></span>[5](#fn_544), *it was* on
account of the much coming of wisdom unto them. 21. And *as to* Yim,
Frê*d*ûn, Kâî-Ûs <span id="fr_553"></span>[6](#fn_545), and those other
rulers who obtained splendour (var*g*ŏ) and mightiness (tagakîh) <span
id="fr_554"></span>[7](#fn_546) from the sacred beings just as the
participation of Vi*s*tâsp and other rulers in the religion
occurred <span id="fr_555"></span>[8](#fn_547)—and their not attaining
to the religion, and also as to the *times* when they have become
ungrateful unto their own lord <span id="fr_556"></span>[9](#fn_548),
*it was* on account of the little coming of wisdom unto them.

22\. 'And Aharman, also, and the demons deceive that man more, and lead
*him* to hell, who is poorer

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

of wisdom and unsteadier in disposition. 23. And *it* is manifest, that,
unto *him* who is virtuous in disposition, habit, and demeanour <span
id="fr_557"></span>[1](#fn_549), praise is then *due*, owing to his
maintenance of wisdom. 24. For *it* is declared, that Aharman shouted to
Zaratû*s*t thus <span id="fr_558"></span>[2](#fn_550): "If thou desist
from this good religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers, then I *will* give
thee a thousand years’ dominion of the worldly *existence*, (25) as
*was* given to the Va*d*akân <span id="fr_559"></span>[3](#fn_551)
monarch Dahâk <span id="fr_560"></span>[4](#fn_552)." 26. On account of
complete wisdom, the virtuous disposition and demeanour of Zaratû*s*t
not *having* hearkened and not being deluded, he did not become deceived
and longing through that temptation of the accursed evil *one*, the
wicked <span id="fr_561"></span>[5](#fn_553). 27. And he spoke to
Aharman (28) thus: "I *will* shatter and cause to run (dûkânam) <span
id="fr_562"></span>[6](#fn_554), and *will* make downcast (nigûîsâr) for
thee <span id="fr_563"></span>[7](#fn_555), the bodies of your demons
and fiends, wizards and witches, through the Hôm <span
id="fr_564"></span>[8](#fn_556) *and* sacred twigs <span
id="fr_565"></span>[9](#fn_557), and the good, true

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

religion which the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd* *has* taught to me." 29.
Aharman, when those words *were* heard by him, became confounded and
stupefied, and rushed to hell, and remained confounded a long time.

30\. 'This, too, is declared, that Aûha*r*ma*zd*, when Aharman, by
agreement <span id="fr_566"></span>[1](#fn_558), had further
operated <span id="fr_567"></span>[2](#fn_559) with his
(Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s) creatures and creation of every kind, afterwards
formed an assembly with the angels and archangels of every kind <span
id="fr_568"></span>[3](#fn_560), and the welfare (â*v*â*d*îh) due to his
own wisdom *was* mentioned and recounted by him.

31\. 'This, too, is declared, that *for* the nine thousand years of
renovation <span id="fr_569"></span>[4](#fn_561), until the resurrection
and future existence, wisdom maintains and stimulates the creatures and
creation of every kind.

32\. 'And this, too, is declared, that, *as to* him who is an ignorant
and bad-tempered man, when he attains even to much eminence, opulence,
and authority, even then he is not fit to elevate into that welfare and
authority.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_518"></span>[99:1](sbe24063.htm#fr_525) So in K43, but Nêr.
has taken this verb in the third person,. in place of the nearly
synonymous âfrî*d*ŏ, so as to state that the creator 'created,
maintains, and stimulates the angels' and all other existences through
the power of innate wisdom. The object of the Pahlavi text, however,
seems to be to emphasize the fact that the creation was specially due to
the innate wisdom of the creator, while its maintenance is dependent on
all his powers and attributes.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[99:2](sbe24063.htm#fr_527) See Chaps. II, 95,
XXVII, 63.

<span id="fn_520"></span>[99:3](sbe24063.htm#fr_528) L19 has 'of.'

<span id="fn_521"></span>[99:4](sbe24063.htm#fr_529) L19 has 'times.'

<span id="fn_522"></span>[99:5](sbe24063.htm#fr_530) That is, in
escaping from the risk of being sent to hell.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[99:6](sbe24063.htm#fr_531) L19 omits 'and
coming.'

<span id="fn_524"></span>[100:1](sbe24063.htm#fr_532) Nêr. has read
shâyastan, 'possibility,' instead of nishâstanŏ, 'seating.'

<span id="fn_525"></span>[100:2](sbe24063.htm#fr_533) Reading
vâdûrnî-hênd. L19 has 'are possible to effect.'

<span id="fn_526"></span>[100:3](sbe24063.htm#fr_534) L19 has 'by means
of the great potency and force.'

<span id="fn_527"></span>[100:4](sbe24063.htm#fr_535) See Chap. XLIV, 16
n.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[100:5](sbe24063.htm#fr_536) See Chap. IX, 2 n.

<span id="fn_529"></span>[100:6](sbe24063.htm#fr_537) The signs of the
zodiac, whose apparent movement, due to the motion of the earth, is here
alluded to.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[100:7](sbe24063.htm#fr_538) See Chap. IV, 5 n.

<span id="fn_531"></span>[100:8](sbe24063.htm#fr_539) The five
supplementary days, named after the five Gâthas or sacred hymns, which
follow the twelfth month in order to complete the Parsi year of 365
days. Together with the five preceding days they are specially devoted
to the homage of the guardian spirits or Fravashis.

<span id="fn_532"></span>[101:1](sbe24063.htm#fr_540) The four grades of
heaven (see Chap. VII, 9-12).

<span id="fn_533"></span>[101:2](sbe24063.htm#fr_541) See Chap. II, 115
n. By omitting 'and' Nêr. identifies this bridge with the path mentioned
before if, but it forms only one portion of the path to the other world.

<span id="fn_534"></span>[101:3](sbe24063.htm#fr_542) Assuming that
mâ-vênakŏ stands for mayâ-vênakŏ.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[101:4](sbe24063.htm#fr_543) Pahl. vîkhtanŏ is
more probably connected with Pers. kîkhtan, 'to break,' than with Pers.
pîkhtan, 'to sift.'

<span id="fn_536"></span>[101:5](sbe24063.htm#fr_544) The Sanskrit
version adds 'and Aharman's.'

<span id="fn_537"></span>[101:6](sbe24063.htm#fr_545) L19 has 'more
fully through the power.'

<span id="fn_538"></span>[101:7](sbe24063.htm#fr_546) L19 has 'worldly
*existences*.'

<span id="fn_539"></span>[101:8](sbe24063.htm#fr_547) Reading
girî-hastŏ. L19 has 'are effected.'

<span id="fn_540"></span>[102:1](sbe24063.htm#fr_548) L19 omits 'to
effect.'

<span id="fn_541"></span>[102:2](sbe24063.htm#fr_549) See Chap. XIII, 14
n.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[102:3](sbe24063.htm#fr_550) See Chap. I, 10 n.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[102:4](sbe24063.htm#fr_551) See Chap. XXVII, 2
n.

<span id="fn_544"></span>[102:5](sbe24063.htm#fr_552) L19 has 'who more
fully obtained a share of heaven.'

<span id="fn_545"></span>[102:6](sbe24063.htm#fr_553) See Chap. VIII,
27, where all three are mentioned.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[102:7](sbe24063.htm#fr_554) L19 has
'opulence.'

<span id="fn_547"></span>[102:8](sbe24063.htm#fr_555) This clause occurs
only in K43.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[102:9](sbe24063.htm#fr_556) They all three
suffered misfortunes in their old age, attributed by the priesthood to
neglect bf religion, which is here traced to diminution of intellect.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[103:1](sbe24063.htm#fr_557) L19 has 'virtuous
in disposition and virtuous of demeanour.'

<span id="fn_550"></span>[103:2](sbe24063.htm#fr_558) This is stated, in
other words, in Vend. XIX, 23-32.

<span id="fn_551"></span>[103:3](sbe24063.htm#fr_559) As Va*d*ak is said
(Dd. LXXII, 5) to have been the mother of Dahâk, this term may be a
matronymic implying 'son of Va*d*ak.'

<span id="fn_552"></span>[103:4](sbe24063.htm#fr_560) See Chap. VIII, 29
n.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[103:5](sbe24063.htm#fr_561) This section is a
good deal altered in the Pâzand version, but the general meaning is the
same.

<span id="fn_554"></span>[103:6](sbe24063.htm#fr_562) L19 has va vânom,
'and I *will* smite.'

<span id="fn_555"></span>[103:7](sbe24063.htm#fr_563) L19 has 'and
*will* make withered (nizâr).'

<span id="fn_556"></span>[103:8](sbe24063.htm#fr_564) A plant growing in
Persia, small twigs of which are pounded in water, and the resulting
juice is tasted by the priest during the ceremonial. It is a symbol of
the mythic Hôm, the producer of immortality. (see Chap. LXII, 28).
Originally, no doubt, the Hôm (Av. haoma) and the Sans. soma were the
same plant (see Dd. XLVIII, 16 n).

<span id="fn_557"></span>[103:9](sbe24063.htm#fr_565) The baresôm (Av.
baresma) is a bundle of slender twigs or wires, prepared in a particular
manner, to be held in the left hand <span id="page_104">p. 104</span> of
the priest while reciting certain parts of the liturgy (see Dd. XLIII, 5
n).

<span id="fn_558"></span>[104:1](sbe24063.htm#fr_566) The covenant
between the good and evil spirits, by which their conflict was limited
to nine thousand years (see Bd. I, 18, 19).

<span id="fn_559"></span>[104:2](sbe24063.htm#fr_567) That is,
transformed and vitiated them. The Av. frâkere*n*ta*d* (Vend. I, 7),
describing the modifying work of the evil spirit upon the creation, is
here expressed by f*r*â*g*ŏ vâdûn*d*.

<span id="fn_560"></span>[104:3](sbe24063.htm#fr_568) Such an assembly
is mentioned in Vend. II, 42, but its proceedings are not stated.

<span id="fn_561"></span>[104:4](sbe24063.htm#fr_569) So in all
versions, but, as the renovation is generally considered as confined to
the end of the nine thousand years, we ought perhaps to transpose the
words and read 'for the nine thousand years, until the renovation,
resurrection, and future existence.'
