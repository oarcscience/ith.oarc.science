### CHAPTER LXI.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Which is the chief of
men? Which is the chief of women? 3. Which is the chief of horses? Which
is the chief of flying creatures? 4. \[Which is the chief of
oxen?\] <span id="fr_584"></span>[6](#fn_576) Which is the chief of wild
animals? Which is the chief of grains?'

5\. The spirit of wisdom answered (6) thus: 'The man who is wise, who is
steadfast in the religion, who is well-praising, who is true-speaking is
chief over *his* associates.

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

7\. 'The woman who is young <span id="fr_585"></span>[1](#fn_577), who
is properly disposed, who is faithful, who is respected, who is
good-natured, who enlivens the house, whose modesty and awe are
virtuous, a friend of her own father and elders <span
id="fr_586"></span>[2](#fn_578), husband and guardian, handsome and
replete with animation <span id="fr_587"></span>[3](#fn_579) is chief
over the women who are her own associates.

8\. 'The ox which is glorious, which is tall-eared, which has a herd *of
cows* is chief over oxen.

9\. 'The *K*îharâ*v* <span id="fr_588"></span>[4](#fn_580) is the chief
of birds. 10. The horse which is swift <span
id="fr_589"></span>[5](#fn_581) is the chief of horses. 11. The
hare <span id="fr_590"></span>[6](#fn_582) is the chief of wild animals;
*and* wheat <span id="fr_591"></span>[7](#fn_583) is the chief of
grains.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_576"></span>[107:6](sbe24067.htm#fr_584) K43 omits the
question in brackets.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[108:1](sbe24067.htm#fr_585) L19 has 'talking,
eloquent.'

<span id="fn_578"></span>[108:2](sbe24067.htm#fr_586) Nêr. translates
nîyâk by 'father's brother,' an elder who is considered as a special
protector in India.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[108:3](sbe24067.htm#fr_587) Reading
namag-âkûn, which epithet is omitted in L19.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[108:4](sbe24067.htm#fr_588) A name of the
Kar*s*ipt, who is said to be the chief of birds in this world (Pahl.
Visp. I, 1, Bd. XXIV, 11), the Vi*s* Kar*s*ipta who brought the religion
to the enclosure formed by Yim (see Vend. II, 138, 139), and which is
said, in the Pahlavi version, to be 'a *K*ahârvâk (or *K*ahârnâk) who
goes back into the existence of the spirits.' To determine the meaning
of this name (which Nêr. translates by Sans: *k*akravâka, 'Brahmany
duck') we have to consider not only the two forms *k*îharâ*v* and
*k*ahârvâk, but also the term *k*ark, 'falcon,' used in Bd. XXIV, 11.
The *k*âmrô*s* of Bd. XIX, 15, XXIV, 29 (the *k*înâmrô*s* of Chap. LXII,
40) is also said to be the chief of birds, but probably mythic birds are
meant.

<span id="fn_581"></span>[108:5](sbe24067.htm#fr_589) L19 has 'white,'
as in Bd. XXIV, 6.

<span id="fn_582"></span>[108:6](sbe24067.htm#fr_590) See Bd. XXIV, 9.

<span id="fn_583"></span>[108:7](sbe24067.htm#fr_591) See Bd. XXIV, 19.
