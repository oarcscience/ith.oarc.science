### CHAPTER XXV.

1\. The twenty-fifth subject is this, that any agreement and promise
(qaûl) they make with any one it is necessary so far to perform and
bring to pass. 2. Although many things *may* go <span
id="fr_1238"></span>[6](#fn_1228) to harm by means (sabab) of it, it is
not desirable to perform that agreement with duplicity.

3\. Because, in our religion, they call this a Mihir-dru*g* ('breach of
promise'), *and* in revelation it decrees, *as to* any one *who* commits
a Mihir-dru*g*, that the way *to* heaven becomes closed for him, and
that person himself goes discomforted out of this world, so that a
warning (’halâmat) becomes quite manifest unto him.

4\. And a Mihir-dru*g* is attached <span
id="fr_1239"></span>[7](#fn_1229) *in* such a manner that, *if* fortune
(*t*âli’h) may have befallen any one <span
id="fr_1240"></span>[8](#fn_1230)

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

happily, or an insufficient quantity of his life (’humr) may have
remained, the Mihir-dru*g* extends to his children without opposition
(‘*h*ilâf). 5. And every household that becomes extinct, or race whose
issue fails, or *any of* the great misfortunes that happen to
mankind—from which misfortune *one* obtains release with difficulty—may
all be owing to the *fact* that they have committed a Mihir-dru*g*.

6\. If *committed by* oneself, it is declared, *in* one place in
revelation, that the glorified Zaratu*s*t, the Spitamân, enquired of
Hôrmazd, the good *and* propitious, thus: 'Of any of the sins that
mankind commit which is the worst?' 7. Hôrmazd, the good *and*
propitious, decreed thus: 'No sin whatever is worse than this, that two
persons make a covenant with one another *in* such a manner that no one
whatever is between them, except me who am Hôrmazd; *and*, afterwards
one of those two persons deviates *from it*, and says, "I have no
knowledge (‘*h*abar) *of it*," and no one whatever is a witness, for
that *other* person, except me.' 8. No sin whatever is worse than that,
and that person himself *will* not go out of this world until
retribution overtakes him, and in that *other* world his punishment is
more severe than all; *so* that person becomes unfortunate *in* both
worlds. 9. And it is the same *if* this covenant *be* with a righteous
*person or* a wicked *one*.
