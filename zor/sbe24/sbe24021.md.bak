### CHAPTER XV.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Is poverty good, or
opulence <span id="fr_230"></span>[1](#fn_227.md)?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'Poverty which is through
honesty is better than opulence which is from the treasure of others. 5.
For it is stated (6) thus: "*As to* him who is the poorest and most
secluded (armê*s*ttûm) <span id="fr_231"></span>[2](#fn_228.md) person,
whenever he keeps his thoughts, words, *and* deeds honest, and in duty
to the sacred beings, for him even *there* is lawfully a share of all
the duties and good works which mankind shall do in the world <span
id="fr_232"></span>[3](#fn_229.md). 7. *As to* him, too, who is opulent,
who is a man of much wealth, when the wealth is not produced by honesty,
though he takes trouble (an*g*înakŏ) in <span
id="fr_233"></span>[4](#fn_230.md) duties and good works and righteous
gifts, his good work is then not his own, (8) because the good work is
his from whom *the wealth* is abstracted <span
id="fr_234"></span>[5](#fn_231.md)."

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

9\. 'And *as to* that much wealth which is collected by proper exertion,
and *one* consumes and maintains with duties and good works and
pleasure, even that is no better thereby, (to) because it is necessary
to consider that as perfect. 11. But *as to* him who is a man of much
wealth, whose wealth is collected by proper exertion, and he consumes
and maintains *it* with duties and good works and pleasure, he is great
and good and more perfect <span id="fr_235"></span>[1](#fn_232.md).

12\. 'And regarding even that which is sovereignty they state (13) thus:
"What is <span id="fr_236"></span>[2](#fn_233.md) good government in a
village is better than what is <span id="fr_237"></span>[2](#fn_233.md) bad
government in a realm. 14. Because the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd* produced
good government for effecting the protection of the creatures, (15) and
Aharman, the wicked, has produced bad government as the adversary of
good government."

16\. 'Good government is that which maintains *and* directs a province
flourishing, the poor untroubled, *and* the law *and* custom true, (17)
*and* sets aside improper laws and customs. 18. It well *maintains*
water and fire by law <span id="fr_238"></span>[3](#fn_234), (19.md) *and*
keeps in progress the ceremonial of the sacred beings, duties, and good
works. 20. It causes friendliness

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

and pleading <span id="fr_239"></span>[1](#fn_235) for the poor, (21.md)
and delivers up itself, *and* even that which is its own life, for the
sake of the good religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers. 22. And if there
be any one who desists from the way of the sacred beings, then it orders
*some one* to effect his restoration thereto; (23) it also makes him a
prisoner, *and* brings *him* back to the way of the sacred beings; (24)
it allots, out of the wealth that is his, the share of the sacred beings
*and* the worthy, of good works *and* the poor; (25) and delivers up the
body for the sake of the soul <span id="fr_240"></span>[2](#fn_236.md). 26.
A good king, who <span id="fr_241"></span>[3](#fn_237.md) is of that kind,
is called equal to the angels and archangels.

27\. 'Bad government is that (28) which destroys the true and proper law
and custom, (29) and brings <span id="fr_242"></span>[4](#fn_238.md)
oppression, plunder, and injudiciousness into practice. 30. It
dissipates the treasure of the spiritual *existence*, (31) *and*
considers duty and good works a vexation, through greediness <span
id="fr_243"></span>[5](#fn_239.md). 32. It keeps back a person performing
good works from doing good works, (33) and he thereby becomes a doer of
harm. (34) Its disbursement <span id="fr_244"></span>[6](#fn_240.md), too,
of every kind is for its own self, (35) the administration of <span
id="fr_245"></span>[7](#fn_241.md) the treasure

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

of the worldly existence, (36) the celebrity <span
id="fr_246"></span>[1](#fn_242) *and* exaltation of the vile, (37.md) the
destruction *and* neglect of the good, (38) *and* the annihilation of
the poor. 39. A bad king, who <span id="fr_247"></span>[2](#fn_243.md) is
of that kind, is called equal to Aharman and the demons.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_227"></span>[42:1](sbe24021.htm#fr_230.md) L19 adds 'or
sovereignty,' to account for §§ 12-39.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[42:2](sbe24021.htm#fr_231.md) Av. armaê*s*ta,
applied to water, means 'most stationary, stagnant;' Pahl. armê*s*t (Av.
airima) is applied to the place of 'seclusion' for impure men and women,
and in Sls. VI, 1 it seems to refer to 'helpless' idiots or lunatics;
Nêr. explains it in Sanskrit as 'lame, crippled, immobility,' but
'secluded, immured, helpless' are terms better adapted to the context,
whether the word be applied to persons, as it is here and in Chaps.
XXXVII, 36, XXXIX, 40, or to learning and character, as in Chap. LI, 7.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[42:3](sbe24021.htm#fr_232.md) Persons who are
wholly unable to perform good works are supposed to be entitled to a
share of any supererogatory good works performed by others (see Sls. VI,
1, 2), but the allotment of such imputed good works seems to be at the
discretion of the angels who keep them in store (see Sls. VIII, 4).

<span id="fn_230"></span>[42:4](sbe24021.htm#fr_233.md) Nêr. has 'makes
expenditure on,' by reading khvazînak, as in Chap. XIII, 3.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[42:5](sbe24021.htm#fr_234.md) § 8 does not occur
in L19, but is found in TD2, PA10, and MH7.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[43:1](sbe24021.htm#fr_235.md) That is, the proper
use of wealth does not make the wealth itself any better, but only the
rightful possessor of it. This is, however, probably only an emendation
of Nêr., as the copy of TD2 gives merely the following, for §§ 9-11:
'But *as to* him who is a man of much wealth, by whose proper exertion
it is collected, *and* he consumes *and* maintains *it* with duties,
good works, and pleasure, he is no better thereby, because it is
necessary to consider him as perfect.'

<span id="fn_233"></span>[43:2](sbe24021.htm#fr_237.md) L19 omits 'what is'
in both places.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[43:3](sbe24021.htm#fr_238.md) TD2 omits
'maintains,' as it is sufficiently expressed by the same Pahl. verb
'keeps' in § 19; and. L19 omits 'by law.'

<span id="fn_235"></span>[44:1](sbe24021.htm#fr_239.md) Reading
dâ*d*ŏ-gôbîh, 'pronouncing the law,' or 'speaking of gifts,' instead of
Pâz. *g*âda*n*gôî, a misreading of Nêr. for Pahl. yêdatô-gôbîh, speaking
of the sacred being.'

<span id="fn_236"></span>[44:2](sbe24021.htm#fr_240.md) The usual way of
treating nonconformists in all ages and all sects, when party spirit is
strong. TD2 has 'delivers *him* up for the sake of body and soul.'

<span id="fn_237"></span>[44:3](sbe24021.htm#fr_241.md) TD2 has 'good
government which.'

<span id="fn_238"></span>[44:4](sbe24021.htm#fr_242.md) TD2 has 'keeps;'
but the two verbs are much alike in Huzvâri*s*.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[44:5](sbe24021.htm#fr_243.md) Because nearly all
such works entail expenditure.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[44:6](sbe24021.htm#fr_244.md) Nêr. has
'accumulation,' but this is the meaning of andô*z*i*s*n, rather than of
the andâ*z*i*s*n in the text.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[44:7](sbe24021.htm#fr_245.md) So in TD2.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[45:1](sbe24021.htm#fr_246.md) Reading khanî*d*îh
as in TD2 and Chap. II, 28.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[45:2](sbe24021.htm#fr_247.md) TD2 has 'bad
government which.'
