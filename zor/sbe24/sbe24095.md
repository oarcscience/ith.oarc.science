### CHAPTER VII.

1\. The seventh subject is this, that, when a sneeze (’ha*t*sat) comes
forth from any one, it is requisite to recite one Yathâ-ahû-vairyô <span
id="fr_1133"></span>[3](#fn_1125.md) and one Ashem-vohû <span
id="fr_1134"></span>[4](#fn_1126.md). 2. Because there is a fiend in our
bodies, and she is an adversary who is connected with mankind, and
strives so that she *may* make misfortune (’hillat) and sickness
predominant (mustaûlî) over mankind. 3 And in our bodies there is a fire
which they call a disposition—in Arabic they say *t*abî’hat—and they
call *it* the sneezing instinct (*gh*arîzî). 4. *It is* connected with
that fiend, *and* they wage warfare, and it keeps her away from the body
of man. 5. Then, as the fire becomes successful over

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

that fiend, *and* puts her to flight (hazîmat), a sneeze comes because
that fiend comes out.

6\. Afterwards, because it is necessary, they recite these *inward*
prayers <span id="fr_1135"></span>[1](#fn_1127.md) and perform the
benediction (âfrîn) of the fire, so that it may remain *for* a long
period while thou art keeping <span id="fr_1136"></span>[2](#fn_1128.md)
this fiend defeated. 7. When another person hears the sneeze, it is
likewise requisite for him to utter the said prayers, and to accomplish
the benediction of that spirit <span id="fr_1137"></span>[3](#fn_1129.md).

<span id="fn_1126"></span>[265:4](sbe24095.htm#fr_1134.md) A formula in
praise of righteousness, which begins with these two Avesta words, and
is in constant use (see Bd. XX, 2).

<span id="fn_1127"></span>[266:1](sbe24095.htm#fr_1135.md) The formulas are
muttered as a spell.

<span id="fn_1128"></span>[266:2](sbe24095.htm#fr_1136.md) B29 has 'it is
making.'

<span id="fn_1129"></span>[266:3](sbe24095.htm#fr_1137.md) In some parts of
Europe it is still the custom to invoke a blessing, by means of some
formula, on hearing a sneeze.
