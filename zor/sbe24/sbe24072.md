### CHAPTER II.

1\. The first subject (2) is about several questions *that* the
ever-successful Mit*r*ô-aîyyâr <span id="fr_651"></span>[1](#fn_643.md),
son of Mahmâ*d*,

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

from Spâhân <span id="fr_652"></span>[1](#fn_644.md), asked with good
intent *and* not in search of defects, *and* the answer *thereto*.

3\. *As to* that which is asked thus: 'Why did Aharman hurry on to the
light <span id="fr_653"></span>[2](#fn_645.md), and how was it possible to
be *so* when *he* is not *of* a like nature with it, though we always
see that whatever is not *of* a like nature abstains from a different
nature as much as water *does* from fire?' 4. The answer is this, that
the cause itself of the hurrying on of Aharman, which *was* to the
light, *was his* different nature. 5. And on account of the desire of a
destroyer, which was perpetually in his nature, *he* is a destroyer of
different natures.

6\. Being injured *and* injuring, however they occur, do not take place
except from difference of nature and those of a different nature. 7.
Because *in* those of a like nature *there* exist similarity of will and
unanimity, one towards the other, not injuring *and* being injured. 8.
And those of a different nature, on account of *their* opposing nature,
are destroyers *and* injurers, one of the other, however they come
together. 9. Those of a like nature, on account of unanimity and
similarity of nature, are lively <span id="fr_654"></span>[3](#fn_646.md),
efficient, and mutually helping, when they come together.

10\. The disintegration and separation of like natures is the disunion
of different natures. 11. Just

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

as heat *and* cold which, on account of *their* opposing nature, are
destroyers and injurers, resisting *and* disintegrating one another,
through *their* perpetual nature. 12. Because every disintegration is
owing to the laws (rastagân) of cold and dryness, heat and moisture,
(13) and *their* destruction, injuring, *and* opposition of one another.
14. For the disintegration of bodies is owing to the perpetual
struggling of heat and cold, dryness and moisture; (15) *and* owing to
their struggling, one with the other, bodies are disintegrated *and*
disabled.

16\. Of water and fire, through their own nature, no injury whatever is
manifest; (17) but the cold of *their* fraternization <span
id="fr_655"></span>[1](#fn_647.md) is mingled with the moisture of the
water, *and* is an opponent of the heat of the fire; (18) and the
dryness of *their* fraternization is mingled with the heat of the fire,
*and* is counteractingly an injurer of the moisture *of* the water.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_643"></span>[122:1](sbe24072.htm#fr_651.md) This person, who
is not mentioned elsewhere, was probably a layman and evidently a
Ma*zd*a-worshipper, although his father's name seems to be Muhammadan,
either Ma‘hmûd or Mu‘hammad. The Parsis under a Muhammadan government
often adopted Muhammadan names, as they also took Hindu names in India;
but, in this case, it is perhaps more probable that the father had
become <span id="page_123">p. 123</span> a convert to Muhammadanism, and
changed his name accordingly, after his son had grown up.

<span id="fn_644"></span>[123:1](sbe24072.htm#fr_652.md) The Pahlavi form
of Ispahân.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[123:2](sbe24072.htm#fr_653.md) In Bd. I, 9, 10 we
are told that when the evil spirit arose from the abyss, he rushed in to
destroy the light which he then saw for the first time, but was
frightened away by its bravery and glory.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[123:3](sbe24072.htm#fr_654.md) So understand by
Nêr., but zîvihend may mean 'they are graceful,' or it may be a
misreading of zênîhend, 'they are armed.'

<span id="fn_647"></span>[124:1](sbe24072.htm#fr_655.md) When water comes
in contact with fire.
