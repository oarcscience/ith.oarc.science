### CHAPTER XIV.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of <span id="fr_226"></span>[1](#fn_223.md)
\[wisdom (2) thus: 'Which protection is the more defensive? 3. Which
friend <span id="fr_227"></span>[2](#fn_224) (4.md) and which supporter of
fame are good? 5. Which helper of enjoyment is good? 6. Which wealth is
the pleasanter? 7. And which is the supremest pleasure of all
pleasures <span id="fr_228"></span>[3](#fn_225.md)?'

8\. The spirit of wisdom answered (9) thus: 'The sacred being is the
more defensive protection. 10. A virtuous brother is a good friend. 11.
A child, who is virtuous and an upholder of religion, is a good
supporter of fame. 12. A virtuous wife, who is well-disposed, is a good
helper of enjoyment. 13. That wealth is better and pleasanter which is
collected by honesty, *and one* consumes *and* maintains with duties and
good works. 14. *And* the pleasures which are superior to all pleasures
are health of body, freedom from fear, good repute, *and*
righteousness <span id="fr_229"></span>[4](#fn_226.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_223"></span>[41:1](sbe24020.htm#fr_226.md) From this point to
Chap. XXVII, 49 the Pahlavi text of K43 is missing, owing to the loss of
nine folios in that MS., but a copy of the missing passage, made by
Dastur Hoshangji Jamaspji from TD2, has been consulted for the purpose
of controlling the Pâz. version of L19.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[41:2](sbe24020.htm#fr_227.md) L19 inserts 'is
good?'

<span id="fn_225"></span>[41:3](sbe24020.htm#fr_228.md) TD2 has 'which is
the friend who is the supremest of friends;' but this does not
correspond well with the reply in § 14.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[41:4](sbe24020.htm#fr_229.md) TD2 adds '*and* are
good.'
