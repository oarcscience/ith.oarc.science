### CHAPTER LXVI.

1\. The sixty-sixth subject is this, that it is incumbent on all
women <span id="fr_1430"></span>[2](#fn_1419) to order the days (ayyâm)
of the Dvâzdah-hômâst <span id="fr_1431"></span>[3](#fn_1420), because
the whole of any sin that may have arisen during menstruation, and *at*
other times, becomes cleared away *thereby*.

2\. And in the commentary of the Vendîdâ*d* it says *that* every one
becomes sanctified in the days of the Dvâzdah-hômâst, and all sins
become cleared away from her, like that which *occurs at* harvest time,
when a great wind comes on and carries it off; dust like this the sin
departs from her, and the person becomes clean *and* pure.

3\. And, for women <span id="fr_1432"></span>[4](#fn_1421), there is no
duty more indispensable than this; for it is declared in revelation
that, when they celebrate a Dvâzdah-hômâst, it is a good work of a
hundred thousand Tanâvars <span id="fr_1433"></span>[5](#fn_1422), and
if

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

it be the days of the Dvâzdah-hômâst it is a good work of a
thousand thousand Tanâvars, and when they celebrate *it* by day it is a
good work just like this.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1419"></span>[330:2](sbe24154.htm#fr_1430) B29 has 'on the
wives of every one,' and J15 has 'on every one.'

<span id="fn_1420"></span>[330:3](sbe24154.htm#fr_1431) In the
Gu*g*arâti version (p. 310) of the long-metre Sad Dar Dastûr Jâmâspji
states, in a foot-note, that the Dvâzdah-hômâst consists of a Yazi*s*n
ceremony every day for 144 days, in honour of twelve angels, so that
each angel is reverenced for twelve successive days. He stated formerly
(see Byt. II, 59 n) that this celebration was a Hômâst, and that a
Dvâzdah-hômâst was a similar celebration for 264 days in honour of
twenty-two angels for twelve days each. It appears, however, from Chap.
XLI, 7, 20, that the number of ceremonies may vary with the wealth of
the individual.

<span id="fn_1421"></span>[330:4](sbe24154.htm#fr_1432) Lp omits these
thirteen words.

<span id="fn_1422"></span>[330:5](sbe24154.htm#fr_1433) See Sls. XVI, 6.
