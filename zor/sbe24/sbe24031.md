3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'Of the rich he is the
poorer who is not content with that which is his, (5) and suffers
anxiety for the increase of anything.

6\. '*And* of the poor he is the richer who is content with that which
has come, (7) and cares not for the increase of anything.'
