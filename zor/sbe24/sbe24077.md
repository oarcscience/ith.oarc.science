### CHAPTER VII.

1\. Another *subject* is about the existence of a competitor of a
different nature, as shown above <span id="fr_753"></span>[1](#fn_745),
(2) that, from the constructing, qualifying, *and* ennobling of things
so sagaciously, *and* even from the circumstances of an unimproving
(a*k*ârîk) hand put upon the concentrated light, *it* is manifest that
its maker, constructor, concentrator, *and* qualifier is sagacious. 3.
Also his constructing sagaciously is manifest, from each separately,
through the qualifying *and* ennobling of his own works severally. 4.
And his working sagaciously is an indicator that his work is purposed
*and* caused, (5) because every one of the works of the sagacious ought
to be purposed *and* caused. 6. The purpose and cause of a work arise
first, the work *itself* afterwards.

7\. From the many kinds of his work *it* is manifest that his work is
willed and requisite. 8. For *there*

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

are two modes of doing a work, (9) either the willed is *of* the many
kinds which are his will, (to) or the quality is *of* one kind which is
as it is qualified <span id="fr_754"></span>[1](#fn_746); (11) *so* from
the many kinds *of* work of the creator *it* is manifest that his work
is willed and requisite. 12. And his will is owing to a necessity of
different limit <span id="fr_755"></span>[2](#fn_747), (13) because his
will *was* a requisite for the power of the original evolution.

14\. The purpose and cause of a work are before the necessity, (15)
because while the purpose of the necessity of a work does not occur, the
necessity does not exist. 16. The purpose of a work arises from the
cause, towards which the necessity of that work instigates. 17. The
necessity *and* willing of a thing which is caused exist; (18) and a
cause of the necessity of a thing owing to its own self is not well
suited, (19) because the cause arises from progression, (20) concerning
which an indicator is the purposed work that is sagacious. 21. The
purpose is owing to a cause, the cause is owing to promptitude
(aûstâ*v*), the promptitude is owing to an exception (ba*r*â), the
exception is owing to an injurer, and the injury is owing to an
opponent, without *further* words.

22\. I *have* also shown <span id="fr_756"></span>[3](#fn_748), on this
subject, through inevitable knowledge and through analogy, the making
and qualification of the world and its circumstances *and* appliances.
23. From the making and qualification of the world is manifested a maker
and qualifier; (24) and <span id="fr_757"></span>[4](#fn_749) \[through
the purposely-made

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

work of the sagacious creator, (25) owing to\] the purposely-made
work <span id="fr_758"></span>[1](#fn_750), is manifested the existence
of an injurer from without.
