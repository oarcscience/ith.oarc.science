### CHAPTER LXXXVIII.

1\. The eighty-eighth subject is this, that, *as to any piece of* wood
on which they carry a corpse, or on which they wash *it*, and that which
may be defiled with blood and impurity, that on which menstruous
*defilement*, or a bare limb, is deposited by a *menstruous* woman, and
that on which they impale a human being, it is necessary to avoid the
whole of these *pieces of* wood, and not to work with <span
id="fr_1549"></span>[1](#fn_1538) them again, because one's dress
becomes impure; and it is not proper to burn *them*. 2. It is necessary
to put *them* in a place where any one, *who* pulls *them* up and stirs
*them, will* not <span id="fr_1550"></span>[2](#fn_1539) bring *them*
into the use of mankind.
