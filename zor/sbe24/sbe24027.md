### CHAPTER XXI.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'What is the end of
the world-arranging *and* spirit-destroying man? 3. What is the end of
him who is a scoffing man? 4-6. What is the end of the idle, the
malicious, and the lazy man? 7. What is the end of a false-hearted
*one*, (8) and the end of an arrogant *one* <span
id="fr_274"></span>[1](#fn_270.md)?'

9\. The spirit of wisdom answered (10) thus: 'He who is a
world-arranging *and* spirit-destroying man is as injured, in the
punishment of the three *nights* <span id="fr_275"></span>[2](#fn_271.md),
as a raging fire when water comes upon it.

11 <span id="fr_276"></span>[3](#fn_272.md). 'Of him who is a scoffing man
*there* is no glory in body and soul; (12) *and* every time when he
opens *his* mouth his wickedness then increases. 13. All the fiends,
too, become so lodged in his body, that they leave no goodness whatever
for his body; (14) and he makes mockery of the good, and glorification
of the vile. 15. Also in the worldly *existence* his body is infamous,
and *in* the spiritual *existence his* soul is wicked. 16. And, for
effecting *his* punishment in hell, they deliver him over to

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

the scoffing fiend; (17) *and* that fiend inflicts a ridicule and a
mockery upon him with every single punishment.

18\. '*As to* him who is an idle man, yet devoid of wickedness, mostly
when <span id="fr_277"></span>[1](#fn_273.md) death comes on in the worldly
*existence*, he thereupon (a*g*a*s*) begets pleasantly for the sake of
another.

19\. 'The bridge <span id="fr_278"></span>[2](#fn_274.md) which is for the
soul of him who is a malicious man is more difficult than *for* the
other wicked who are in hell. 20. For this reason, because malice
proceeds by lineage; (21) *and* it is possible to manage every sin
better than malice, (22) because malice will abide in a lineage. 23.
There are *instances* when it adheres <span
id="fr_279"></span>[3](#fn_275.md) until the renovation *of the universe;*
(24) for *it* is clearly declared by the pure revelation, (25) that the
origin of the estrangement (anîrânîh) of the Arûmans, *and* even the
Tûrânians, *from* the Irânians, was owing to that malice which *was*
generated by them through the slaughter of Aîrî*k* <span
id="fr_280"></span>[4](#fn_276); (26.md) *and it* always adheres until the
renovation.

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

27\. 'He who is a lazy man is said *to be* the most unworthy of men. 28.
Because *it* is declared by revelation, (29) that the creator
Aûha*r*ma*zd* produced no corn for him who is a lazy man; (30) for him
who is a lazy man *there* is then no giving of anything in gifts and
charity <span id="fr_281"></span>[1](#fn_277); (31.md) and lodging and
entertainment are not to be provided for him. 32. For this reason,
because that food which a lazy man eats, he cats through impropriety and
injustice; (33) and, on account of his laziness and unjust eating, his
body then becomes infamous and the soul wicked.

34\. 'He who is a false-hearted man is as dubious in good *things* as in
bad; (35) *he* is dubious as to the treasure of the spiritual and
worldly *existences*, and also as to the ceremonial, invocation, *and*
service of the sacred beings. 36. And, on account of these
circumstances, the angels *and* archangels shall accept little of the
ceremonial *and* invocations which he performs, (37) and give unto him
little of the gain, too, which he seeks. 38. And in the mouth of the
good *man he* is always infamous, (39) and his soul becomes wicked.

40\. 'The friends of him who is an arrogant man are few, and his enemies
many. 41. And even of the gifts which he gives to any one, *and* the
ceremonial, too, which he performs for the sacred beings, they shall
accept little, on account of *his* arrogance, (42) and give little of
the gain, too, which he seeks. 43. And in hell they deliver him to the
fiend of arrogance, in order to inflict punishment upon *his* soul; (44)
and the fiend of arrogance inflicts punishment of various kinds upon it,
*and* is not pacified.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_270"></span>[51:1](sbe24027.htm#fr_274.md) L19 has 'What is
the end of him who is an idle man?' in § 4, and repeats the same formula
in each of the §§ 5-8.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[51:2](sbe24027.htm#fr_275.md) Referring to the
three days and nights of final punishment, reserved for those specially
wicked, at the time of the resurrection (see Bd. XXX, 12-16).

<span id="fn_272"></span>[51:3](sbe24027.htm#fr_276.md) In TD2 the
remaining sections are arranged in the following order:—§§ 18, 27-33,
19-26, 34-44, 11-17.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[52:1](sbe24027.htm#fr_277.md) L19 inserts 'misery
and.'

<span id="fn_274"></span>[52:2](sbe24027.htm#fr_278.md) The *K*indvar
bridge (see Chap. II, 115, 162), which is supposed to resemble a beam
with many unequal sides, the side turned uppermost being narrower in
proportion as the soul, intending to pass along it, is more wicked; so
that the difficulty of the transit increases with the sin of the soul
(see Dd. XXI, 3-5).

<span id="fn_275"></span>[52:3](sbe24027.htm#fr_279.md) Or 'continues.'

<span id="fn_276"></span>[52:4](sbe24027.htm#fr_280.md) Pâz. *E*raz, one of
the three sons of Frê*d*ûn, the Pê*s*dâ*d* sovereign, who divided his
empire among them, giving the Arûman provinces to Salm, the Tûrânian to
Tû*g*, and the Irânian to Aîrî*k*. The last was slain by his two
brothers, and his death was subsequently avenged by his descendant
Mânû*sk*îhar (see Chap. XXVII, 41-43, Bd. XXXI, 9-12). Though these sons
are not mentioned in the Avesta now extant, their history appears to
have been related in the *K*i*d*rast Nask (see Sls. X, 28 n).

<span id="fn_277"></span>[53:1](sbe24027.htm#fr_281.md) L19 has 'he then
gives nothing *as* his living, which is through gifts and charity.'
