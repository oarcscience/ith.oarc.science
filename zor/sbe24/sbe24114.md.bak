### CHAPTER XXVI.

1\. The twenty-sixth subject is this, that the wise and the ancients say
that when a man becomes fifteen years *of age* it is necessary that he
takes

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

one of the angels <span id="fr_1241"></span>[1](#fn_1231.md) as his own
protection <span id="fr_1242"></span>[2](#fn_1232.md), *that* he takes one
of the wise as his own sage, and *that* he takes one of the high-priests
and officiating priests as his own high-priest. 2. So that, if, any
time, a bereavement (âstânah) approaches, he *may* beg a favour from the
archangels <span id="fr_1243"></span>[3](#fn_1233.md), in order that it
*may* furnish <span id="fr_1244"></span>[4](#fn_1234.md) an escape *from
that* bereavement. 3. And <span id="fr_1245"></span>[5](#fn_1235.md), any
time any affair comes forward, and *he has* <span
id="fr_1246"></span>[6](#fn_1236) to have opinion (râî.md) *and* advice
(ma*s*varat), he holds a consultation with that sage, while the sage
tells him *his* opinion (tadbîr). 4. And, if any *question as to* proper
and improper comes forward, he speaks with that high-priest, so that he
*may* tell him *in* reply.

5\. When the instructions of these three persons are brought to pass,
carrying *out* the commands of the sacred being is accomplished. 6.
Especially the instructions of the high-priests, because their
satisfaction is connected with the satisfaction of the sacred being; and
the high-priests possess so much dignity (martabat) *in* the presence of
the sacred being, the good *and* propitious, that they are quite able to
forgive *any* trivial one of the sins of mankind <span
id="fr_1247"></span>[7](#fn_1237.md), and Hôrmazd, the good *and*
propitious, quickly <span id="fr_1248"></span>[8](#fn_1238.md) forgives
that sin for the high-priest. 7.

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Therefore,
carrying *out* the commands of the high-priests becomes <span
id="fr_1249"></span>[1](#fn_1239.md) incumbent on every one; and the
fulfilment of this maxim is *better* than *that of* a whole assemblage
of maxims.
