### CHAPTER LXVIII.

1\. The sixty-eighth subject is this, that for a menstruous woman who
casts an eye upon a fire it is a sin of twelve dirhams *in* weight <span
id="fr_1442"></span>[4](#fn_1431); and if she goes *within* three steps
of the fire it is a sin of a thousand *and* two hundred dirhams <span
id="fr_1443"></span>[5](#fn_1432) *in* weight for her; and when she puts
her hand *to* the fire it is a sin of fifteen Tanâvars for her.

2\. In like manner, if she takes a look *at* running water it is a sin
of twelve dirhams *in* weight for her <span
id="fr_1444"></span>[6](#fn_1433); if she goes *within* fifteen steps of
running water it is a sin of fifteen dirhams *in* weight for her; and
when she sits down in running water it is a sin of fifteen Tanâvars for
her. 3. And when she walks in the rain, through every drop that drops
upon her limbs *there* arises a sin of one Tanâvar for her.

4\. *If* she comes to a Khûrshê*d* Nyâyi*s* <span
id="fr_1445"></span>[7](#fn_1434), to observe *it*, it is not proper
*for her* to speak a word with a

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

righteous man <span id="fr_1446"></span>[1](#fn_1435). 5. It is not
proper *for her* to put a bare foot on the ground. 6. It is not proper
*for her* to eat any food with a *bare* hand; it is not proper *for her*
to eat bread *when* satisfied <span id="fr_1447"></span>[2](#fn_1436).
7. It is not proper *for* two menstruous women to eat together; it is
not proper for them to sleep *so* <span
id="fr_1448"></span>[3](#fn_1437).

8\. And so long as three days *have* not elapsed it is not proper to
wash the hands <span id="fr_1449"></span>[4](#fn_1438), and three days
after that, if she *has* perceived herself clean, it is requisite to
remain another day, and *so* until the lapse of nine days, *when*, if
she *has* perceived herself clean, it is not necessary *to remain* to
the end of <span id="fr_1450"></span>[5](#fn_1439) another *interval of*
time. 9. If menstruation occurs *for* twenty-nine days, it is
necessary <span id="fr_1451"></span>[6](#fn_1440) to consider that she
is menstruous a second time, and during three other days it is not
proper to wash again, and it is necessary to exercise care, just like
that which <span id="fr_1452"></span>[7](#fn_1441) I first wrote
*about*.

10\. If she be doubtful whether menstruation is come to her, it is
requisite *for her* to strip off *her* dress, and then to take notice if
she has become menstruous, *or if* the dress that is stripped off be
clean. 11. If she has an infant *to feed* with *her* milk,

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

*one* puts away the dress from the infant, and gives *it to* the mother
till it *has* fed *on* the milk, *and* then it is proper to give *it* to
other persons. 12. It is pure, but when the mother washes *her* head she
also washes <span id="fr_1453"></span>[1](#fn_1442) the head of the
infant.

13\. And it is necessary *for* a menstruous *woman* that she *should*
not pass by the end of <span id="fr_1454"></span>[2](#fn_1443) anything
ceremonially washed, for, if it be a thousand cubits (gaz) *in length*,
she makes the whole *of it* polluted, *and* it becomes unclean. 14. With
any one *who* holds a sacred-twig stand <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[3](#fn_1444) she *should* not speak a word; *and*
if a priest holds the sacred twigs in *his* hand, *and* a menstruous
*woman* speaks some (ba’hʓ̣ê) words <span
id="fr_1456"></span>[4](#fn_1445) from afar, or he walks within three
steps of a menstruous woman, she makes *it* <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[5](#fn_1446) unclean.
