### CHAPTER LXIII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Which is that good
work which is greater and better <span id="fr_629"></span>[1](#fn_621)
than \[all <span id="fr_630"></span>[2](#fn_622)\] good works, and no
trouble (an*g*înakŏ) whatever is necessary for its performance <span
id="fr_631"></span>[3](#fn_623)?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'To be grateful in the
world, (5) *and* to wish happiness for every one. 6. This is greater and
better than every good work, and no commotion (an*g*înakŏ) whatever is
necessary for its performance <span id="fr_632"></span>[4](#fn_624).'

Peace and prosperity <span id="fr_633"></span>[5](#fn_625).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_621"></span>[113:1](sbe24069.htm#fr_629) L19 inserts 'more
valuable and more advantageous.'

<span id="fn_622"></span>[113:2](sbe24069.htm#fr_630) K43 omits 'all.'

<span id="fn_623"></span>[113:3](sbe24069.htm#fr_631) L19 has 'no
trouble and expense are necessary in it.'

<span id="fn_624"></span>[113:4](sbe24069.htm#fr_632) This reply is much
altered by Nêr. and stands as follows, in L19:—'To wish happiness for
every one; (5) to be grateful unto the sacred beings and the good; (6)
in every position and time to consider and keep in remembrance
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, as regards creativeness, and Aharman, as regards
destructiveness; (7) and to be without doubt as to the existence of the
sacred beings, the religion and soul, heaven and the account in the
three days, and the reality of the resurrection and future existence. 8.
This, most especially, is the good work which is greater and better,
more valuable and more advantageous than all good works, and no trouble
and expense are necessary in it.'

The text of all versions ends abruptly at this point, without any
peroration.

<span id="fn_625"></span>[113:5](sbe24069.htm#fr_633) Only in K43.
