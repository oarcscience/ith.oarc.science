### CHAPTER LXXXIII.

1\. The eighty-third subject is this, that it is requisite to abstain
from the keeping of fasts. 2. For, in our religion, it is not proper
that they *should* not eat every day *or* anything, because it would be
a sin *not to do so*.

3\. With us the keeping of fast is this, that we keep fast from
committing sin with *our* eyes and tongue and ears and hands and feet.
4. Some people are striving about it, so that they *may* not eat
anything all day, and they practise abstinence from eating anything. 5.
For us it is also necessary to make an effort, so that we *may* not
think, *or* speak, *or* commit any sin; and it is necessary that no bad
action *should* proceed from our hands, *or* tongue, *or* ears, *or*
feet, which would be a sin owing to them.

6\. Since I have spoken *in* this manner, and have brought forward the
fasting of the seven members of the body, that which, in other
religions, is fasting owing to not eating is, in our religion, fasting
owing to not committing sin.
