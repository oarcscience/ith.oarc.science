### CHAPTER XLVII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'What is that thing
*which* is the most perfect of all wealth? 3. What is that which is
predominant over everything whatever? 4. And what is that from which no
one is able to escape?'

5\. The spirit of wisdom answered (6) thus: 'It is wisdom which is
better than the wealth of every kind which is in the world. 7. It is
destiny which is predominant over every one and everything. 8. And *it
is* Vâê the bad <span id="fr_475"></span>[1](#fn_470.md) from whom no one
is able to escape.'
