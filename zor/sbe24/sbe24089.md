### CHAPTER I.

1\. The first subject is this, that it is necessary that they become
steadfast in the religion, and do not introduce any hesitation (*s*akk)
and doubt into the heart. 2. And *that* they make a statement (‘haqîqat)
with confidence (i’htiqâd), that the good religion, the true and
perfect, *which* the Lord sent into the world (‘*h*alq), is that which
Zaratu*s*t has brought; which is this I hold <span
id="fr_1086"></span>[4](#fn_1078).

3\. Every time <span id="fr_1087"></span>[5](#fn_1079) that mankind are
like this, and do

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

not introduce any hesitation *and* doubt into the heart, of every duty
*and* good work that *others* have done, from the days of Zaratu*s*t
until these days, and of whatever *one* does after this until the
resurrection, *there* is a share <span id="fr_1088"></span>[1](#fn_1080)
*for* that person. 4. When the soul, on the fourth night <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[2](#fn_1081), arrives at the head of the *K*inva*d*
bridge, the angel Mihir and the angel Rashn <span
id="fr_1090"></span>[3](#fn_1082) make up its account (‘hisâb) and
reckoning. 5. And, if the good works it has done *be* deficient *in*
quantity, of every duty *and* good work that those of the good religion
have done *in* the earth of seven regions they appoint it a like portion
(naʓîb), till the good works become more in weight <span
id="fr_1091"></span>[4](#fn_1083); and the soul arrives righteous in the
radiant locality of heaven.

6\. For it is declared in revelation, that of the duty <span
id="fr_1092"></span>[5](#fn_1084) *and* good work which they perform in
doubt—that is (ya’hnî), they entertain a suspicion like this, that 'I do
not know that this faith, which I possess, is better *in comparison*
with other faiths'—no merit whatever comes to their souls. 7. Therefore,
the first (avval) thing is to become steadfast in the religion; and this
is the chief of all good works.
