### OBSERVATIONS.

1\. The division into chapters corresponds with the beginnings of the
questions, and the sections are divided according to the alternating
Pâzand-Sanskrit text of Nêryôsang.

2\. Italics are used for any English words that are not expressed, or
fully understood, in the original text, but are added to complete the
sense of the translation.

3\. Italics occurring in Oriental words, or names, represent certain
peculiar Oriental letters (see the 'Transliteration of Oriental
Alphabets' at the end of this volume). The italic *d*, *l*, *n*, *r*,
*v* may be pronounced as in English; but *g* should be sounded like j,
*hv* like wh, *k* like ch in 'church,' *s* like sh, and *z* like French
j.

4\. In Pahlavi words the only vowels expressed in the original text are
those circumflexed, initial a, and the letter ŏ; italic *d* is written
like t, *r* and *l* like n or the Avesta o, *v* and *z* like *g*, and
*zd* like â in the Pahlavi character.

5\. In the translation, words in parentheses are merely explanatory of
those which precede them.

6\. For the meanings of the abbreviations used in the notes, see the end
of the Introduction.

7\. The manuscripts mentioned are:—

K43 (written A.D. 1569) Pahlavi, No. 43 in the University Library at
Kopenhagen; upon the text of which, so far as it extends, this
translation is based.

L19 (written A.D. 1520) Pâz.-Sans., No. 19 in the India Office Library
at London.

MH7 (written A.D. 1809) Pârsî-Pers., No. 7 of the Haug Collection in the
State Library at Munich.

MH10, a Persian Rivâyat, No. 10 of the same Collection.

PA10 (written A.D. 1649) Pâz.-Sans., No. 10 of the Anquetil Collection
in the National Library at Paris.

PB6, Pâz.-Sans., No. 6 of the Burnouf Collection in the same library.

TD2, Pahlavi, belonging to Mobad Tehmuras Dinshawji Anklesaria at
Bombay; upon a copy of which this translation chiefly relies in the
passages (XIV, 1-XXVII, 49 and XXXIX, 31-XL, 17) missing from K43.
