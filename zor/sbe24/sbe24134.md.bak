### CHAPTER XLVI.

1\. The forty-sixth subject is this, that, when people become fourteen
years *of age*, it is necessary to tie on the *sacred
thread-*girdle <span id="fr_1336"></span>[3](#fn_1325.md), because the
high-priests have said that it is likewise necessary to take into
account those nine months that they have been in the womb of the mother.

2\. For in our religion there is no duty better than wearing the *sacred
thread-*girdle, and it is incumbent

on man and woman. 3. And, in former days, if any one should have become
completely fifteen years *of age*, and should not have worn the *sacred
thread-*girdle, they would have done for him by stoning, as bread and
water are forbidden (‘harâm) for him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1325"></span>[309:3](sbe24134.htm#fr_1336.md) See Chap. X,
which mentions fifteen years in accordance with Vend. XVIII, 115, 120.
But Sls. X, 13 recommends fourteen years and three months as more
prudent, no doubt for the reason stated here in the text.
