### CHAPTER XXXIV.

1\. The thirty-fourth subject is this, that it is greatly necessary to
refrain from much slaughter of animals and the cattle species <span
id="fr_1267"></span>[1](#fn_1257.md). 2. Because it says in
revelation <span id="fr_1268"></span>[2](#fn_1258.md) that, *for* every one
who slaughters many animals *and* cattle <span
id="fr_1269"></span>[3](#fn_1259.md), every fibre of the hair of a goat
becomes, in that *other* world, like a sharp sword, *and* adheres in the
soul of that person.

3\. And there are several things the slaughter of which is very bad, and
the sin very abundant, *as* the lamb, the kid, the ploughing ox, the war
horse, the swallow bird that catches the locust, and the cock; and of
the whole of these the sin is most *as regards* the cock. 4. If it
becomes a necessity <span id="fr_1270"></span>[4](#fn_1260.md), it is
proper to kill a cock *that* does not crow <span
id="fr_1271"></span>[5](#fn_1261.md), and it is necessary to consecrate
their heads. 5. Any head of an animal, not consecrated, it is not
desirable to eat, so that it becomes so far <span
id="fr_1272"></span>[6](#fn_1262.md) a righteous gift. 6. If *one* be not
able to consecrate the head, it is requisite to consecrate one kidney
*as* a substitute (badal) for it.
