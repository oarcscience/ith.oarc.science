### CHAPTER XXIV.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: On account of the
begging of favours, and the practice and worthiness of good works, do
the sacred beings also grant anything to men otherwise <span
id="fr_286"></span>[2](#fn_282.md), or not?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'They grant; (5) for *there
are* such as they call thus: "Destiny *and* divine providence." 6.
Destiny is that which is ordained from the beginning, (7) *and* divine
providence is that which they also grant otherwise. 8. But the sacred
beings provide and manifest in the spiritual *existence* little of that
grant, on this account, because Aharman, the wicked <span
id="fr_287"></span>[3](#fn_283.md), through the power of the seven planets
extorts wealth, *and* also every other benefit of the worldly
*existence*, from the good *and* worthy, *and* grants *them* more fully
to the bad *and* unworthy.'

than by destiny, as mentioned in the previous chapter, and in
consequence of prayer and merit.

'through that cause.'
