### CHAPTER LXXXVII.

1\. The eighty-seventh subject is this, that, when

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

any one departs from the world <span id="fr_1536"></span>[1](#fn_1525.md),
it is necessary to make an effort, in those three days, so that they
*may* continuously perform the ceremonial of Srôsh <span
id="fr_1537"></span>[2](#fn_1526.md) and make the fire blaze, and *may*
recite the Avesta; because the soul is three days in this world <span
id="fr_1538"></span>[3](#fn_1527.md).

2\. The fourth night it is requisite to consecrate three sacred cakes;
one *with* a dedication *to* Rashn <span
id="fr_1539"></span>[4](#fn_1528.md) and Â*s*tâ*d* <span
id="fr_1540"></span>[5](#fn_1529.md), one *with* a dedication *to* the
spirit Râm <span id="fr_1541"></span>[6](#fn_1530.md), *and* one *with* a
dedication to the righteous guardian spirit; *and one is* to consecrate
a dress and something *as* a righteous gift for that soul <span
id="fr_1542"></span>[7](#fn_1531.md).

3\. It is necessary that the dress be new and of uniform quality
(*g*ins), and such as turban, shirt, vest, girdle, trowsers, shoes
(pasandil) <span id="fr_1543"></span>[8](#fn_1532.md), and mouth-veil. 4.
Since they give those among the spirits a counterpart of those garments,
therefore, whatever is more beautiful, *and* more surpassing *in*
grandeur for the soul *in* that place, is necessary where that place is,
because our fathers and mothers and the whole of *our* relations are
*in* that place. 5. *And* since the souls recognise and ask after one
another in that world, they are, therefore, more joyful on account of
every one whose dress <span id="fr_1544"></span>[9](#fn_1533.md) and
grandeur are more surpassing. 6. In a similar manner, when the dress is
old and ragged, they are ashamed, and exhibit heaviness of heart.

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

7\. They call that dress a righteous gift because they consecrate *it*;
and it is necessary to give *it to* the priests and high-priests, as it
is a righteous gift on account of their position. 8. And it is suitable
for them to keep *it* for the reason that the souls are nearer to them;
*people should also* make an effort that the dress may be stitched like
the dress of a priest.

9\. The sacred beings make up the account *and* reckoning for the soul
when the priest recites frasasti ahurahê mazd*a*u <span
id="fr_1545"></span>[1](#fn_1534.md) and removes the Frasast <span
id="fr_1546"></span>[2](#fn_1535.md) from this side to that side. 10. The
soul passes over the *K*inva*d* bridge when, *on* the fourth night, it
arrives from the world *at* the *K*inva*d* bridge. 11. First it goes to
the abode of fire (âta*s*-gâh) <span id="fr_1547"></span>[3](#fn_1536.md);
afterwards, one step reaches to the star station, the second step
reaches to the moon station, the third step to the sun station, *and*
with the fourth step it reaches the *K*inva*d* bridge <span
id="fr_1548"></span>[4](#fn_1537.md), *and* they convey it to its own
place.

<span id="fn_1535"></span>[352:2](sbe24175.htm#fr_1546.md) A Frasast is a
sacred cake marked on the upper side with nine superficial cuts (in
three rows of three each) made with a fingernail while repeating the
words humat hûkht huvar*s*t, 'well-thought, well-spoken, well-done,'
thrice, one word to each of the nine cuts. It is placed before the
consecrating priest, but to his right, while the ordinary sacred cakes
are to his left (see Haug's Essays, pp. 396, 407, 408).

<span id="fn_1536"></span>[352:3](sbe24175.htm#fr_1547.md) That is, when it
leaves the vicinity of the body, after hovering about it for three
nights (see Sls. XII, 5).

<span id="fn_1537"></span>[352:4](sbe24175.htm#fr_1548.md) In other
accounts the soul has to pass over this bridge before it steps forwards
to the stars and moon and sun (see Mkh. II., 123, 145, VII, 9-12, Dd.
XXXIV, 3, AV. V, 2, VII-IX, 1).
