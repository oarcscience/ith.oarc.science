### CHAPTER XVI.

1\. Again, about the delusion of Mânî, one out of the thousands *and*
myriads is written; (2) for I am not unrestrained (anatang) as to
writing more fully of the delusion, twaddle, and deceit of Mânî and the
Mânîchaeans, (3) and much trouble and long-continued daily work is
necessary for me therein.

4\. Now you Ma*zd*a-worshippers of Zaratû*s*t should know that the
original statement of Mânî *was* about the unlimitedness of the original
evolutions, (5) the intermediate *one* about *their* mingling, (6) and
the final *one* about the distinction of light from dark, (7) that which
is much more like unto want of distinction <span
id="fr_1056"></span>[1](#fn_1048.md).

8\. Again, *he states* this, that the worldly existence is a bodily
formation of rudiments of Aharman; (9) the bodily formation *being* a
production of Aharman. 10. And a repetition of that *statement* is this,
that the sky is from the skin, (11) the earth from the flesh, (12) the
mountains from the

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

bones, (13) and the trees from the hair of the demon Kunî <span
id="fr_1057"></span>[1](#fn_1049.md). 14. The rain is the seed of the
Mâzendarâns <span id="fr_1058"></span>[2](#fn_1050.md) who are bound on the
*celestial* sphere. 15. Mankind are two-legged demons, and animals
four-legged. 16. And Kunî is the commander of the army of Aharman, (17)
who, to be liberated by <span id="fr_1059"></span>[3](#fn_1051.md) his
nails from the divinity Aûha*r*ma*zd* *in* the first conflict, swallowed
the light; (18) and, in the second conflict, the demon Kunî *was*
captured by them, *together* with many demons. 19. And it is *in*
binding the demon Kunî on the *celestial* sphere *he* is killed, (20)
*and* these magnificent creatures are preserved from him and formed.

21\. And the sun *and* moon are arranged in supremacy *in* the outer
sky; (22) so that, as regards that light which the demons swallowed,
they filter and excite <span id="fr_1060"></span>[4](#fn_1052.md) *it*,
little *by* little, through the exciting and filtering of the sun and
moon. 23. Then Aharman knew, through foresight, that they *would*
rapidly filter and release this light through the exciting of the sun
and moon. 24. *And*, for the purpose of not rapidly releasing the light
from the darkness, he prepared this lesser world which, like mankind,
cattle, *and* the other living creatures, is a wholly-copied similitude
of the greater world

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

with the other bodily creations <span id="fr_1061"></span>[1](#fn_1053.md).
25. He confined life and light in the body, and made *them* prisoners;
(26) so that, while that light which is excited by the sun and moon is
again exhausted through the cohabitation and birth of living creatures,
(27) *their* release would become more tardy.

28\. And the rain was the seed of the Mâzendarâns (29) for the reason
*that* when the Mâzendarâns are bound on the *celestial* sphere <span
id="fr_1062"></span>[2](#fn_1054), (30.md) whose light is swallowed by
them, (31) and, in order to pass *it* from them through a new
regulation, discrimination, and retention of the light of Time <span
id="fr_1063"></span>[3](#fn_1055.md), the twelve glorious *ones* <span
id="fr_1064"></span>[4](#fn_1056.md) show the daughters of Time *to* the
household-attending male Mâzendarâns, (32) so that while the lust of
those Mâzendarâns, from seeing them, is well suited to them, (33) and
seed is discharged from them, (34) the light which is within the seed is
poured *on* to the earth. 35. Trees, shrubs, *and* grain have grown
therefrom, (36) and the light which is within the Mâzendarâns is
discharged in the seed. 37. That which is within the earth is discharged
from the earth as the cause of the trees.

38\. Again, about the difference of nature of life and body, this *is
stated*, that the life is confined and imprisoned within the body. 39.
*And* as the producer and maintainer of the bodily formations of all
material existences is Aharman, (40) for the same reason it is not
expedient to occasion birth *and* to propagate lineage—(41) because it
is co-operating

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

with Aharman in the maintenance of mankind and cattle, and *in* causing
the exhaustion of the life and light within *their* bodies—nor yet to
cultivate trees and grain.

42\. Again, inconsistently, they also say this, (43) that the destroyer
of the creatures is always Aharman; (44) *and*, for the same reason, it
is not expedient to kill any creature whatever, (45) because it
(killing) is the work of Aharman.

46\. Again, *they say* this, that, as the world is maintained by
Aharman, *and in* the end the sacred being is triumphant (47) through
the departure of lives from bodies, (48) this worldly existence is
dissipated in the end, (49) *and* is not arranged anew; (50) nor does
*there* occur a restoration of the dead *and* a future existence.

51\. Again, *they say* this, that those two original evolutions are
perpetually remaining, *and* existed as contiguously as sun and shadow,
(52) and no demarcation <span id="fr_1065"></span>[1](#fn_1057.md) and open
space existed between them.

53\. Now I speak first about the impossibility of the occurrence of any
existing thing *that is* unlimited, (54) except only those which I call
unlimited, *that is*, empty space and time. 55. Those, indeed, which are
for existence within *them—that is* beings and things in locality and
time—are seen *to be* limited.

56\. This, too, *I say*, that, if unity and duality be spoken *of* about
them, *it is* owing to this, because unity, except through the perpetual
encompassing of something, does not then exist therein. 57. For the one
is this, namely, not two; (58) *and* the two

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

are these, namely, the original *one and* the one that is the difference
of *this* one from the other (59) which is not called two. 60. When the
one is not understood, except through the whole compassing of unity,
(61) and duality cannot occur, except through the separation of unit
*from* unit, (62) the one is that one in the unity, and is steadfast in
unity. 63. One and two are in the pedigree (tôkhmak) of quantity *and*
numerousness; (64) and quantity, numerousness, aggregation, and
separation, which, as I *have* said, cannot occur without limitation,
(65) are clear even to medium understandings.

66\. Again, *I say* this, the unlimited is that which is not compassed
by the understanding. 67. When it is not possible to compass by any
understanding, *it* is inevitable *that* it was not possible to compass
in the understanding of the sacred being. 68. It is itself the
peculiarity of the sacred being, *and* even that of the gloomy original
evolution is not wholly compassed within the understanding. 69. To speak
*of* him whose own peculiarity is not compassed within his own
understanding *as* all-good and all-seeing is strange <span
id="fr_1066"></span>[1](#fn_1058), (70.md) because it describes a whole
aggregate, (71) and an aggregate is called a whole on account of
encompassment *on* all sides. 72. *But what is* encompassed *on* all
sides is inevitably limitedness. 73. Is it fitting to account that *as*
a sacred being when aware, from all its own encompassment, *that it* is
limited? 74. *And* if unlimited *it* is unaware *of it*. 75. The first
knowledge of a sage is owing to his well-arranging <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[2](#fn_1059.md) comprehension of his own peculiarity,

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

nature, and quantity; (76) *and* to speak *of him* who was unaware *of*
all his own peculiarity, nature, and quantity, *and* yet wise about
another nature and quantity, is strange <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[1](#fn_1060.md).

77\. This, too, *I say*, that as the unlimited, on account of
non-encompassment, is not compassed by the understanding, (78) that
*implies* this, that all its peculiarity *may be* wise, or there *may*
be *some* that is ignorant; all *may be* light, or there *may* be *some*
that is dark; all *may be* alive, or there *may* be *some* that is dead;
and *one* is unaware of it.

79\. Again, *I say* this, that the light and the life which I obtain
here are an allotment that exists owing to the selfsame Time <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[2](#fn_1061.md), or *they are* not. 80. If *they be*
an allotment that exists owing to a peculiarity of Time, that *implies
that men* should well recognise this, that anything owing to whose
allotment it is possible to ordain them must be provided with
allotments. 81. *As to what is* provided with allotments, except when
united it is then not possible *even* for it, (82) and *as to what is*
united, except through the uniter by whom that united *thing* is united
it does not then determine it. 83. And when the allotment made is seen
*to be* limited, the origin from which the allotment is *in* like manner
made is doubtless a limited existence. 84. As regards that, since they
say that all allotment of a result is a giver of evidence *as* to *its*
origin, (85) that *implies*, when I obtain an allotment made *and*
limited, *that* an origin even of that, except when made and united

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

from allotments *and* limited, is then not possible to exist.

86\. This, too, *I say*, that the unlimited is not bestowed, (87)
because an allotment is bestowed from an aggregate, (88) and aggregation
is an evidence as to limitation, (89) as I *have* shown above <span
id="fr_1070"></span>[1](#fn_1062.md). 90. So that *as to* the existence
*and* nature of the origin, except by the likeness and similitude of the
result, I do not then attain to them. 91. Whatever is obtained in the
result (92) is certain to exist *in* like manner in the origin. 93. That
*implies* likewise from *this* explanation, when the formation and
limitation are obtainable in the result, *that* the origin also, from
which the result *arises*, is without doubt as to limitation.

94\. Again, *I say* this, that the unlimited is that which *has* an
undisturbed position and an unbounded <span
id="fr_1071"></span>[2](#fn_1063) individuality, (95.md) and there is no
other position *or* resting-place for it disturbed *apart* from it. 96.
That *implies*, when two original evolutions are said *to be* unlimited
and of unbounded (asâmân) individuality, *that* the skies *and* earths,
the rudimentary bodily formations, growths, *and* lives, the luminaries,
divinities, *and* archangels, *and* the many congregations
(hambari*s*nân) whose different names are owing to the difference of
each one *of those two* from the other, cannot be limited. 97. What
produced all those within them, and where *is it*, (98) when the two
original evolutions have been eternally *in* an undisturbed position?
99.

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Unless that
individuality of theirs, which is unlimited, *be* made limited, how is
it possible *for* a place to exist for all these *things that* are *and*
were *and will* be made? 100. If a nature that is always unlimited can
become limited, that certainly *implies that* it could even become
nothing; (101) *and* that which they say about the unchangeableness of a
nature is strange <span id="fr_1072"></span>[1](#fn_1064.md).

102\. This, too, you should understand, that the unlimited becomes that
which *has* disturbed it, which *was* not appointed by it *at* first;
(103) nothing different from it can exist separate from it. 104. Apart
from the boundary of unlimitedness it is not understood, (105) or,
stupidly, *one* does not know that thing, that is, of what *it is* he
always speaks and contends and bandies words about, *and* thereby
deludes those with a trifle of the trifles of knowledge into *some* way
*and* whither. 106. If he uncritically <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[2](#fn_1065.md) says even this of it, that its
individuality is unlimited, and its knowledge also, *being* unlimited,
knows through unlimited knowledge that it is unlimited, (107) that is a
strange *thing* which is twofold strange <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[3](#fn_1066.md). 108. One is this, that of knowledge,
except about things acquired by knowledge and compassed within
knowledge, (109) nothing whatever is understood until complete, except
that which is wholly compassed within knowledge and acquired, (110)
which knowledge of anything arises through entire understanding of the
thing. 111. *And* entire

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

understanding of anything arises through entire compass of the thing
within knowledge <span id="fr_1075"></span>[1](#fn_1067.md).

<span id="fn_1048"></span>[243:1](sbe24086.htm#fr_1056.md) Except the
belief in the two original existences (whose main characteristics are,
respectively, light and darkness) the account of Mânî's doctrines, given
in the Fihrist of Muhammad bin Is‘hâq (see Flügel's Mânî seine Lehre and
seine Schriften), appears to contain none of the details mentioned in
this chapter.

<span id="fn_1049"></span>[244:1](sbe24086.htm#fr_1057.md) So read by Nêr.
in Pâz. and Kûnî in Sans. But there is little doubt that he is the demon
Ku*n*da or Ku*n*di of Vend. XI, 28, 36, XIX, 138, whose Pahlavi name is
Kûnd in Pahl. Vend. XIX, 138, and Kûndak in Bd. XXVIII, 42, in which
latter he is said to be 'the steed of wizards.' Kûndak is written like
Kûnîk in Pahl., and this latter becomes Kunî in Pâz.

'having scratched it with.'

illegible here. JJ has a*hv*araidihâ.

n.

<span id="fn_1067"></span>[251:1](sbe24086.htm#fr_1075.md) The most
complete MSS., yet discovered, break off at this point, without
concluding the subject. It is quite uncertain how much of the work is
lost, but, supposing that all existing MSS. are descended from AK,
supposing that that MS. was originally complete, and supposing that it
was divided into two equal portions (the latter of which is now lost) in
consequence of some division of family property, we might then conclude,
if all these assumptions were correct, that very little of the work is
missing, because the portion of AK still extant extends no further than
Chap. XI, 145 which is very little beyond the middle of the extant text.
