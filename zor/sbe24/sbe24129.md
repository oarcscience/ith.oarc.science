### CHAPTER XLI.

1\. The forty-first subject is this, that it is greatly requisite to
avoid a menstruous woman, while they give *her* bread and food
moderately. 2. As soon as

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

she is not able to eat <span id="fr_1304"></span>[1](#fn_1294.md) they
*should* not give *her* more, and *in* the same manner *as regards*
water, on this account, that whatever remnant comes from that menstruous
*woman* does not come to any use <span
id="fr_1305"></span>[2](#fn_1295.md).

3\. When they wish to provide <span id="fr_1306"></span>[3](#fn_1296.md)
bread they put the hand into the sleeve, or they place something on the
top of the sleeve, *and* it is necessary that her bare hand *should* not
come *forth* again in any place. 4. Because every drop of water that
trickles on to a limb of a menstruous woman becomes a sin of three
hundred stîrs <span id="fr_1307"></span>[4](#fn_1297.md). 5. And it is
requisite *for* a menstruous woman to avoid everything that is washed
*with* ceremony by fifteen steps. 6. It is *also* necessary *for her* to
be *at least* three steps distant from a righteous man, and on whatever
her eye casts a look it diminishes the glory <span
id="fr_1308"></span>[5](#fn_1298.md) of that thing.

7\. And on every woman the twelve ceremonials <span
id="fr_1309"></span>[6](#fn_1299.md), *atoning for* the offence of
menstruation, are incumbent. 8. One on account of the offence that has
occurred as regards the spiritual *existence* <span
id="fr_1310"></span>[7](#fn_1300.md). 9. The second on account of the
offence that has occurred

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

as regards the stars <span id="fr_1311"></span>[1](#fn_1301.md). 10. The
third on account of that which <span id="fr_1312"></span>[2](#fn_1302.md)
has occurred as regards the sun. 11. The fourth on account of that which
has occurred as regards the moon. 12. The fifth on account of that which
has occurred as regards the spirit of fire. 13. The sixth on account of
that which has occurred as regards the spirit of water. 14. The seventh
on account of that which has occurred as regards the spirit of earth.
15. The eighth on account of that which has occurred as regards the
spirit of the wind. 16. The ninth on account of that which has occurred
as regards Khurdâ*d* <span id="fr_1313"></span>[3](#fn_1303.md). 17. The
tenth on account of the offence that has occurred as regards
Ameredâ*d* <span id="fr_1314"></span>[3](#fn_1303.md). 18. The eleventh on
account of the offence that has occurred as regards meal-time (‘*h*urdak
gâh) <span id="fr_1315"></span>[4](#fn_1304.md). 19. The twelfth on account
of the offence that has occurred as regards bodily refuse *and* dead
matter. 20. Therefore it is incumbent on every one *in* this
manner <span id="fr_1316"></span>[5](#fn_1305.md); if any one be more
opulent eighteen *ceremonials* are indispensable, and if she has silver
in excess (ba-*gh*âyat) *there should be* twenty-one, *and in* one place
I have read that twenty-four are indispensable; but, for lesser people,
this that I have noted is necessary.

21\. That which they provide in *their* lifetime is better <span
id="fr_1317"></span>[6](#fn_1306.md); *and*, just as would occur when any
one

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

plants a tree anew, *and* is eating the fruit of it every year, even so
much is that good work increasing every year. 22. If she shall live ten
years, *or* if a hundred years, even so long it is becoming every year
much more <span id="fr_1318"></span>[1](#fn_1307.md). 23. If they provide
*it* after her *lifetime*, that which would be the increase departs; and
in *her* lifetime, also, that occurs which every one, who *has* done a
duty on his own account, has seen, that *the thing* itself *which
others* accomplish after his *lifetime* is very different; so that she
*should* provide *it* with her own hands, not after her decease (vafât).

as her hunger is satisfied.

<span id="fn_1295"></span>[303:2](sbe24129.htm#fr_1305.md) Lp, B29 have 'it
is not possible to make of any use.'

<span id="fn_1296"></span>[303:3](sbe24129.htm#fr_1306.md) Lp, B29 have
'bring.'

<span id="fn_1297"></span>[303:4](sbe24129.htm#fr_1307.md) The amount of a
Tanâvar or Tanâpûhar sin (see Sls. I, 2).

<span id="fn_1298"></span>[303:5](sbe24129.htm#fr_1308.md) Lp, B29 add 'and
purity.'

<span id="fn_1299"></span>[303:6](sbe24129.htm#fr_1309.md) These resemble
the celebration of the Hômâst, but are shorter and less onerous. The
Hômâst consists of a Yasna each day for 144 days in honour of twelve
angels, each angel being reverenced for twelve successive days. The
angels are nearly the same as stated in the text, but the celebration of
the Hômâst is twelve tines as long. The cost of this latter is said to
be 350 rupis (see Byt. II, 59 n). Occasionally a still more onerous
celebration is said to be incumbent on such women as can afford it (see
Chap. LXVI).

<span id="fn_1300"></span>[303:7](sbe24129.htm#fr_1310.md) Lp has 'the
spirits,' and B29 has 'mankind.'

<span id="fn_1301"></span>[304:1](sbe24129.htm#fr_1311.md) B29 has 'the
rain.'

<span id="fn_1302"></span>[304:2](sbe24129.htm#fr_1312.md) Lp, B29 use the
same form of words in §§ 10-16 as in §§ 8, 9.

<span id="fn_1303"></span>[304:3](sbe24129.htm#fr_1314.md) See Mkh. II, 34.

<span id="fn_1304"></span>[304:4](sbe24129.htm#fr_1315.md) Doubtful, and
not understood by the Gu*g*arâti translator.

<span id="fn_1305"></span>[304:5](sbe24129.htm#fr_1316.md) Lp, B29 have
'thus much.'

<span id="fn_1306"></span>[304:6](sbe24129.htm#fr_1317.md) The author
evidently implies, by this paragraph, that the celebration of these
ceremonials was only occasional, perhaps once in a lifetime, but the
earlier the better, so as to admit of a larger growth of merit before
death.

<span id="fn_1307"></span>[305:1](sbe24129.htm#fr_1318.md) Lp, B29 have 'it
is proceeding every year to a head.'
