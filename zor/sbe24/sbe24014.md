### CHAPTER VIII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'How and in what
manner *has* Aûha*r*ma*zd* created these creatures and creation? 3. And
how and in what manner *were* the archangels and the spirit of wisdom
formed and created by him? 4. And how are the demons and fiends \[and
also the remaining corrupted *ones*\] <span
id="fr_185"></span>[2](#fn_183.md) of Aharman, the wicked, miscreated? \[5.
How do every good and evil happen which *occur* to mankind and also the
remaining creatures?\] 6. And is it possible to alter anything which is
destined, or not?'

7\. The spirit of wisdom answered (8) thus: 'The creator, Aûha*r*ma*zd*,
produced these creatures and creation, the archangels and the spirit of
wisdom from that which is his own splendour, and with the blessing of
unlimited time (zôrvân). 9. For this reason, because unlimited time is
undecaying and immortal, painless and hungerless, thirstless and
undisturbed; and for ever and everlasting no one is able to seize upon
*it*, *or* to make *it* non-predominant as regards his own affairs.

10\. 'And Aharman, the wicked, miscreated the (demons and fiends, and
also the remaining corrupted

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

*ones* <span id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_184.md), by his own unnatural
intercourse. 11. A treaty of nine thousand winters <span
id="fr_187"></span>[2](#fn_185) in unlimited time (damân.md) *was* also
made by him with Aûha*r*ma*zd*; (12) and, until it *has* become fully
completed, no one is able to alter *it* and to act otherwise. 13. And
when the nine thousand years *have* become completed, Aharman is quite
impotent; (14) and Srôsh <span id="fr_188"></span>[3](#fn_186.md), the
righteous, will smite Aeshm <span id="fr_189"></span>[3](#fn_186), (15.md)
*and* Mit*r*ô <span id="fr_190"></span>[4](#fn_187.md) and unlimited time
and the spirit of justice <span id="fr_191"></span>[5](#fn_188.md), who
deceives no one in anything, and destiny and divine providence <span
id="fr_192"></span>[6](#fn_189.md) will smite the creatures and creation of
Aharman of every kind, and, in the end, even Â*z*ŏ <span
id="fr_193"></span>[7](#fn_190.md), the demon. 16. And every creature and
creation of Aûha*r*ma*zd* becomes again as undisturbed as those which
*were* produced and created by him in the beginning.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

17\. 'Every good and the reverse <span id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_191.md)
which happen to mankind, and also the other creatures, happen through
the seven *planets* and the twelve *constellations* <span
id="fr_195"></span>[2](#fn_192.md). 18. And those twelve constellations are
such as in revelation are <span id="fr_196"></span>[3](#fn_193.md) the
twelve chieftains who are on the side of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, (19) *and* those
seven planets are called the seven chieftains who are on the side of
Aharman. 20. Those seven planets pervert every creature and creation,
and deliver *them* up to death and every evil. 21. And, as *it were*,
those twelve constellations and seven planets <span
id="fr_197"></span>[4](#fn_194.md) are organizing and managing the world.

22\. 'Aûha*r*ma*zd* is wishing good, and never approves nor contemplates
evil. 23. Aharman is wishing evil, and does not meditate nor approve
anything good whatever. 24. Aûha*r*ma*zd*, when he wishes it, is able to
alter as regards the creatures of Aharman and Aharman, too, it is, who,
when \[he wishes\] <span id="fr_198"></span>[5](#fn_195.md) it, *can do so*
as regards the creatures of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, (25) but *he* is *only* able
to alter so that in the final effect *there may* be no injury of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, (26) because the final victory is Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s own.
27. For it is declared, that "the Yim <span
id="fr_199"></span>[6](#fn_196.md) and

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Frê*d*ûn <span
id="fr_200"></span>[1](#fn_197.md) and Kâî-Ûs <span
id="fr_201"></span>[2](#fn_198.md) of Aûha*r*ma*zd* are created immortal,
(28) and Aharman so altered *them* as is known. 29. *And* Aharman so
contemplated that Bêvarâsp <span id="fr_202"></span>[3](#fn_199.md) and
Frâsîyâk <span id="fr_203"></span>[4](#fn_200.md) and Alexander <span
id="fr_204"></span>[5](#fn_201) *should* be immortal, (30.md) *but*
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, for great advantage, so altered *them* as that which is
declared."'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_183"></span>[32:2](sbe24014.htm#fr_185.md) K43 omits the
phrase in brackets, as well as § 5; but these passages are supplied from
L19, merely substituting yahi*d*akân, 'corrupted ones,' as in § 10, for
the vashûdagã, 'miscreations,' of L19.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[33:1](sbe24014.htm#fr_186.md) Reading
yahi*d*akân, but it may be yâtukân, 'wizards,' though the word requires
an additional long vowel to represent either term correctly. L19 has
vashûdagã, 'miscreations.'

<span id="fn_185"></span>[33:2](sbe24014.htm#fr_187.md) According to the
Bundahi*s*, time consists of twelve thousand years (see Bd. XXXIV, 1).
In the beginning Aûha*r*ma*zd* created the spiritual prototypes (Bd. I,
8) who remained undisturbed for the first three thousand years, when
Aharman appeared and agreed to a conflict for the remaining nine
thousand years (Bd. I, 18), during the first three of which
Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s will was undisputed, while during the next three Aharman
is active in interference, and during the last three his influence will
diminish till, in the end, it will disappear (Bd. I, 20). The nine
thousand years of the conflict were supposed to extend from about B.C.
5400 to A.D. 3600 (see Byt. III, 11 n, 44 n).

<span id="fn_186"></span>[33:3](sbe24014.htm#fr_189.md) See Chap. II, 115.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[33:4](sbe24014.htm#fr_190.md) See Chap. II, 118.

<span id="fn_188"></span>[33:5](sbe24014.htm#fr_191.md) Probably the angel
Rashnû (see Chap. II, 118, 119).

<span id="fn_189"></span>[33:6](sbe24014.htm#fr_192.md) Assuming that the
vâgô-bakhtô of K43 is equivalent to the baghô-bakht, 'divine
appointment,' of L19.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[33:7](sbe24014.htm#fr_193.md) Av. âzi of Yas.
XVII, 46, LXVII, 22, Vend. XVIII, 45, 50, Â*s*tâd Yt. 1, â*z*u of Yas.
LII, 7, and the demon of 'greediness' in Chap. II, 13, 14, XVIII, 5,
&c., Bd. XXVIII, 27, and modern Persian, who seems to be a being
distinct from Av. a*z*i, 'serpent.'

<span id="fn_191"></span>[34:1](sbe24014.htm#fr_194.md) L19 has 'evil.'

<span id="fn_192"></span>[34:2](sbe24014.htm#fr_195.md) The zodiacal signs.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[34:3](sbe24014.htm#fr_196.md) L19 has 'are called
in revelation.' The authority, here quoted, was not the Bundahi*s*,
because that book speaks of seven chieftains of the constellations
opposed to the seven planets (see Bd. V, 1).

<span id="fn_194"></span>[34:4](sbe24014.htm#fr_197.md) L19 omits 'and
seven planets,' but has a blank space at this place in both texts,
Pâzand and Sanskrit.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[34:5](sbe24014.htm#fr_198.md) K43 omits the words
in brackets, which may, perhaps, be superfluous in the Pahlavi text.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[34:6](sbe24014.htm#fr_199.md) Av. Yima or Yima
khshaêta of Vend. II, the Jamshêd of the Shâhnâmah, some of whose deeds
are mentioned in Chap. XXVII, 24-33, Yas. IX, 13-20. He was the third of
the Pê*s*dâ*d* dynasty, and is said to have been perverted by Aharman in
his old <span id="page_35">p. 35</span> age, when he lost the royal
glory (see Dd. XXXIX, 16, 17), and was overthrown by the foreign dynasty
of A*z*-î Dahâk.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[35:1](sbe24014.htm#fr_200.md) Av. Thraêtaona, who
conquered A*z*-î Dahâk (see Chap. XXVII, 38-40, Yas. IX, 24-27). He was
misled by Aharman into dividing his empire between his three sons, two
of whom revolted and slew the third (see Chaps. XXI, 25, XXVII, 42).

<span id="fn_198"></span>[35:2](sbe24014.htm#fr_201.md) Av. Kava Usan or
Kavi Usadhan, the Kaî-Kâvûs of the Shâhnâmah, misread Kahôs in Pâzand.
He was the second monarch of the Kayân dynasty, and made an unsuccessful
attempt to reach heaven, mentioned in Bd. XXXIV, 7, to which he may be
supposed to have been instigated by Aharman, but he was also unfortunate
in many other enterprises.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[35:3](sbe24014.htm#fr_202.md) A title of A*z*-î
Dahâk in the Shâhnâmah, literally, 'with a myriad horses.' This king, or
dynasty, is said to have conquered Yim and reigned for a thousand years,
but was overthrown by Frê*d*ûn. In the Avesta (Yas. IX, 25, Âbân Yt. 34,
Âf. Zarat. 3) A*z*-î Dahâk, 'the destructive serpent,' is described as
hazangrayaokh*s*ti, 'with a thousand perceptions,' a term analogous to
baêvare-spasana, 'with a myriad glances,' which is usually applied to
Mithra, the angel of the sun. From this latter, if used for the former,
bêvarâsp might easily be corrupted.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[35:4](sbe24014.htm#fr_203.md) Av. Frangrasyan,
the Afrâsiyâb of the Shâhnâmah, a Tûrânian king who conquered the
Irânians for twelve years during the reign of Mânû*sk*îhar (see Bd.
XXXIV, 6).

<span id="fn_201"></span>[35:5](sbe24014.htm#fr_204.md) Alexander the
Great, misread Arasa*n*gar by Nêr.
