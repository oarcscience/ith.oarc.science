### CHAPTER XXXVI.

1\. The thirty-sixth subject is this, that it is strictly incumbent on
mankind, on man <span id="fr_1278"></span>[6](#fn_1268.md) and woman, to
perform the Bareshnûm *ceremony* <span
id="fr_1279"></span>[7](#fn_1269.md), because mankind feed on menstruous
*matter* in the womb of the mother. 2. For that reason it is necessary
to perform the Bareshnûm once, so that *one may* become pure from that
pollution. 3. For if *one* becomes fifteen years *of age*, and does not
perform the Bareshnûm, whatever he puts a hand on, the glory and purity
of that thing will diminish; and it

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

is not proper that they put a hand on a sacred cake *or* any *thing*
washed *with ceremony*.

4\. In revelation it says, if any one *who has* not performed the
Bareshnûm shall die, the demons make *him* <span
id="fr_1280"></span>[1](#fn_1270.md) as though *he were* a corpse *kept*
one month in the hot season. 5. And, when the soul arrives at the head
of the *K*inva*d* bridge, the archangels and angels complain of the
stench of that soul, *and* are not able to make *up* its account and
reckoning. 6. It remains at the *K*inva*d* bridge *and* is not able to
pass; it experiences much repentance and has no advantage from it.

7\. If it be necessary for any one to perform the Bareshnûm of the head,
and he be able to do *it, but* does not do *it*, if he performs the
*ceremonial* ablution of the head a thousand times, it does not become
pure from that pollution <span id="fr_1281"></span>[2](#fn_1271.md), and
that is the pollution of Nasru*s*t <span
id="fr_1282"></span>[3](#fn_1272.md), which is amid the veins and sinews,
and the flesh and bones; it does not become pure *through* any other
thing except through *the liquid consecrated by* the religious
formula <span id="fr_1283"></span>[4](#fn_1273.md).

8\. And *as to* that person, also, who performs the Bareshnûm *for*
mankind <span id="fr_1284"></span>[5](#fn_1274.md), it is necessary that he
be a man, a friend of the soul, a truthful speaker, *and* an abstainer,
because through chastity and modesty (mastûrî) he becomes employed. 9.
If complaint of any perfidy in him is publicly diffused <span
id="fr_1285"></span>[6](#fn_1275), in that disgrace (malâmat.md) it is
necessary that the high-priests

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

*should* dislocate his joints one by one, and it is requisite that they
give him as food to the dogs. 10. So that by this action they *may* make
a man observe more chastely and continently, that this result (‘hâʓil)
of sin *may* not occur.
