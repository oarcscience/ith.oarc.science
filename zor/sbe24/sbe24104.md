### CHAPTER XVI.

1\. The sixteenth subject is this, that, when a woman becomes pregnant
in a house, it is necessary to make an endeavour so that *there may* be
a continual fire in that house, and to maintain a good watch *over it*.
2. And, when the child becomes separate from the mother, it is necessary
to burn a lamp *for* three nights *and* days—if they burn a fire it
would be better—so that the demons and fiends *may* not be able to do
any damage and harm; because, when a child is born, it is exceedingly
delicate *for* those three days.

3\. For it is declared in revelation <span
id="fr_1191"></span>[1](#fn_1182), that, when Zaratu*s*t, the Spitamân,
became separate from *his* mother, every night, *for* three nights, a
demon came on, with a hundred and fifty *other* demons, so that they
*might* effect the slaughter (halâk) of Zaratu*s*t, *and*, when they had
beheld the light of the fire, they had fled away, and had not been able
to do any damage and harm.

4\. During forty days it is not proper that they *should* leave the
child alone; and it is also not proper that the mother of the infant
*should* put *her* foot over a threshold in the dwelling, or cast *her*
eyes upon a hill, *for* it <span id="fr_1192"></span>[2](#fn_1183) is
bad *for* her menstruation.
