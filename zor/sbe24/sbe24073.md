### CHAPTER III.

1\. And *as to* that which is asked (2) thus: 'Why does not the creator
Aûha*r*ma*zd* keep Aharman back from evil doing and evil seeking, when
he is the mighty maker? 3. As I assert that no mighty maker is
afterwards imperfect *nor* yet unresisting.'

4\. The answer is this, (5) that the evil deeds of Aharman are owing to
the evil nature and evil will which are always his, as a fiend. 6. The
omnipotence of the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd* is that which is over all
*that* is possible to be, and is limited *thereby*.

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

7\. That which is not possible to be is not stirred up *by* a capable
*or* an incapable being. 8. Whoever says *it is so* is not within the
limits of understanding the words. 9. Because, though he said that it is
not possible to be, he says again that the sacred being is capable of
it, *and* that *has* brought it out of the limits of *what* is not
possible to be. 10. For then *it* is not the not-possible, but the
possible to be.

11\. As his capability is limited, so also is *his* will, thereby. 12.
For *he* is sagacious, (13) and the will of a sagacious *being* is all
for that which is possible to be, (14) and his will does not pass on to
that which is not possible <span id="fr_656"></span>[1](#fn_648), (15)
because he wills all that which is possible *and* fit to be.

16\. If I say that the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd* is able to keep Aharman
back from the evil which is his perpetual nature, (17) it is possible to
change that nature which is demoniacal into a divine *one*, and that
which is divine into a demoniacal *one*; (18) and it is possible to make
the dark light, and the light dark.

19\. *Of* the changing of a nature by its own self those not
understanding nature speak, (20) who are uninformed of the nature of the
result <span id="fr_657"></span>[2](#fn_649) in actions *and*
propensities <span id="fr_658"></span>[3](#fn_650); (21) and they
account the wolf *and* noxious creatures as a benefit.

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

22\. Since the harm and evil which *arise* from mankind and cattle are
not naturally their own, but are owing to the havoc, deceit,
solicitation, *and* deluding <span id="fr_659"></span>[1](#fn_651) of
the fiend, (23) *they* are from the like vileness of other fiends who
are such as the malice, wrath, and lust <span
id="fr_660"></span>[2](#fn_652) which are mingled with mankind. 24. Just
as the swallowing of bitter medicine, which is mingled with poison, is
not the accomplishment of happiness, but for the removal of the pain and
sickness which are owing to an extraneous nature (ba*r*â gôhar). 25. As
of a statement which is true *or* false—(26) though it *may* be that,
connected with a false statement, a righteous man is preserved from much
harm, and is ruined by that which is true—(27) mostly that benefit is
not from the false statement, but from the removal of the destruction
and evil which are mingled with the vile, (28) and that harm is not from
the true statement, but from the evil which is mingled with the vile.

29\. Also, as regards that which *happens* when opponents have appeared
*in order* to remove each one its own competitor, (30) every one is
unrestricted <span id="fr_661"></span>[3](#fn_653) *in* keeping away
that which is its own opponent, (31) such as light *and* darkness,
perfume *and* stench, good works *and* crime, erudition *and* ignorance.
32. That *which* is not unrestricted is the

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

light to keep away stench, nor the perfume darkness; (33) but they have
each separately appeared *in order* to keep away their own opponent.

34\. *As to* that, too, which they say <span
id="fr_662"></span>[1](#fn_654), that in the dark night a righteous man
is preserved from the lion, wolves, dogs, and robbers, (35) *while* in
the light day he becomes a captive <span id="fr_663"></span>[2](#fn_655)
in their hands, (36) it is not proper to consider that as a benefit
owing to darkness, nor yet as an evil owing to light. 37. Because light
is created for the removal of darkness, not for the keeping away of the
lion, wolf, and noxious creatures. *And there are* many other *things*
which are of this nature. 38. On account of tediousness *this* is
collected *merely* as a summary; the virtue *and* understanding of you
triumphant *ones* (39) are so much, that you *may* obtain more from
revelation.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_648"></span>[125:1](sbe24073.htm#fr_656) Sans. adds 'to
be,' and is followed by most of the modern MSS.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[125:2](sbe24073.htm#fr_657) Pâz. vazîha*s*n,
probably a misreading of Pahl. uzdahi*s*n.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[125:3](sbe24073.htm#fr_658) Pâz. gada*s*ni,
both here and in Chaps. IV, 56, VIII, 122, 123, 126, XII, 64, evidently
means 'disposition, peculiarity.' It is probably a misreading of Pahl.
gu*z*ini*s*n, occasioned by some writer connecting the two letters *z*n
and so converting them into a t (*d*).

<span id="fn_651"></span>[126:1](sbe24073.htm#fr_659) Nêr. reads
vyâwãnî, which he understands to mean 'bewildering,' but it is doubtful
if we can derive this meaning from vyâwãn, 'a waterless wilderness,'
which word occurs in Chap. XIV, 30. The original Pahlavi word can be
also read either nîyâ*z*ânîh, 'cause of longing, temptation,' or
nihâ*z*ânîh, 'intimidation.'

<span id="fn_652"></span>[126:2](sbe24073.htm#fr_660) Evil passions
which are personified as fiends (see Mkh. XLI, 10, 11).

<span id="fn_653"></span>[126:3](sbe24073.htm#fr_661) Reading atang,
instead of the similarly-written âtûk which would be the equivalent of
the Pâz. atû (Sans. *s*akta) used by Nêr.

<span id="fn_654"></span>[127:1](sbe24073.htm#fr_662) For the purpose of
arguing that evils are sometimes advantageous, and may, therefore, form
part of the design of a beneficent spirit.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[127:2](sbe24073.htm#fr_663) Or grôh may mean
'a hostage.'
