### CHAPTER XXI.

1\. The twenty-first subject is this, that, when they eat bread, it is
necessary that *one should* recite

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

the Ithâ-â*d*-yazamaidê <span id="fr_1213"></span>[1](#fn_1204) and
three Ashem-vohûs <span id="fr_1214"></span>[2](#fn_1205), especially
(ba-‘*h*âʓʓata*m*) in the benediction-ceremonies (âfrîngân).

2\. For it is declared in the good religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers,
that, when they wish to celebrate the sacred feast (myazd) and
benediction-ceremonies, it is necessary that all persons who are seated
at the feast *should* take up the *inward* prayer. 3. For each man an
angel is stationed, on the right-hand *side*, and two angels for the
priests. 4. *But* when they eat chatteringly, *or* relate the news
(‘hadîTH) <span id="fr_1215"></span>[3](#fn_1206), the angels depart
from them, and a demon seizes on the place of each angel <span
id="fr_1216"></span>[4](#fn_1207).

5\. And in former times the custom (’hâdat) of the people would have
been in this manner, that, if any one should have come to the door in
the middle of the feast, that person whose Âfrîngân-precinct it might
have been, *or* whoever should have gone to the expense of that
Âfrîngân, would have had words with that *intruding* person <span
id="fr_1217"></span>[5](#fn_1208), and would have also spoken thus: 'As
thou hast brought my feast to harm, give me back whatever has been the
cost <span id="fr_1218"></span>[6](#fn_1209).'

6\. And *in* one place in revelation *it is* declared

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

that from eating chatteringly itself is the sin, for <span
id="fr_1219"></span>[1](#fn_1210) every one who is chattering during the
eating of bread is just like him who is smiting and harassing the angels
of the spiritual *existences*.

7\. Therefore, if *there* be any one who is not able to consecrate a
sacred cake <span id="fr_1220"></span>[2](#fn_1211), it is necessary to
eat bread with the *inward* prayer of Hôrmazd, that is, the archangels.
8. And, if he does not altogether know *it*, he recites the
Ithâ-â*d*-yazamaidê <span id="fr_1221"></span>[3](#fn_1212) and three
Ashem-vohûs, and eats up the bread. 9. Afterwards he makes *his* mouth
clean, and, four Ashem-vohûs and two Yathâ-ahû-vairyôs *being* spoken
out <span id="fr_1222"></span>[4](#fn_1213), *he is* then to utter
words.

10\. For, every time that this custom (qâ’hidat) is carried *on* in a
place, through the first Ashem-vohû so much good work *has* arisen that
it has propitiated the sacred being, the good *and* propitious; through
the second Ashem-vohû so much good work *has* arisen that it has
reverenced and <span id="fr_1223"></span>[5](#fn_1214) propitiated
Srôsh, the righteous <span id="fr_1224"></span>[6](#fn_1215); through
the third Ashem-vohû so much good work *has* arisen that it has
reverenced and <span id="fr_1225"></span>[5](#fn_1214) propitiated
Khurdâ*d* *and* Ameredâ*d* <span id="fr_1226"></span>[7](#fn_1216), the
archangels; and through the fourth Ashem-vohû so much good work *has*
arisen that whatever the creator Hôrmazd has created becomes reverenced
and propitiated. 11. And with each mouthful (luqmah) that is eaten,
while the *inward* prayer subsists, they

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

proclaim a blessing *for* Khurdâ*d* and Ameredâ*d*, the archangels. 12.
*But*, if *it be* eaten without the *inward* prayer, as demons are *in*
that place <span id="fr_1227"></span>[1](#fn_1217), they say, 'Thou
mightest have eaten the poison of a serpent.' 13. Therefore, take notice
as to which is the better of these two.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1204"></span>[283:1](sbe24109.htm#fr_1213) Vas. V, 1, 2, of
which these are the first three words. This, with the three Ashem-vohûs,
constitutes the inward prayer, or grace, before eating (see Dd. LXXIX, 1
n).

<span id="fn_1205"></span>[283:2](sbe24109.htm#fr_1214) See Chap. VII, 1
n.

<span id="fn_1206"></span>[283:3](sbe24109.htm#fr_1215) By which they
commit the sin of breaking the protective spell of the inward prayer.

<span id="fn_1207"></span>[283:4](sbe24109.htm#fr_1216) Lp, B29 have 'a
demon is (B29 stands) in place of the angel.'

<span id="fn_1208"></span>[283:5](sbe24109.htm#fr_1217) B29 has 'would
have spoken to that person who had uttered words, would have taken
*something* away from him.' Lp merely adds 'would have taken
*something*' to the words in the text.

<span id="fn_1209"></span>[283:6](sbe24109.htm#fr_1218) B29 has only,
'As it is my feast, give *it* back.' The interruption having destroyed
the merit of the ceremony.

<span id="fn_1210"></span>[284:1](sbe24109.htm#fr_1219) B29 has 'from
eating chatteringly is so much sin that.'

<span id="fn_1211"></span>[284:2](sbe24109.htm#fr_1220) See Mkh. XVI, 17
n.

<span id="fn_1212"></span>[284:3](sbe24109.htm#fr_1221) See § 1 n.

<span id="fn_1213"></span>[284:4](sbe24109.htm#fr_1222) These formulas
begin the grace after eating, and, being uttered aloud, break the spell
of the inward prayer now no longer necessary; after them the eaters are
at liberty to speak.

<span id="fn_1214"></span>[284:5](sbe24109.htm#fr_1225) B29 omits these
two words.

<span id="fn_1215"></span>[284:6](sbe24109.htm#fr_1224) See Mkh. II, 115
n.

<span id="fn_1216"></span>[284:7](sbe24109.htm#fr_1226) See Ho*r*vada*d*
and Ame*r*ôda*d* (Mkh. II, 34).

<span id="fn_1217"></span>[285:1](sbe24109.htm#fr_1227) See § 4.
