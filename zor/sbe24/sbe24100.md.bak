### CHAPTER XII.

1\. The twelfth subject is this, that, when any one dies, an order is
necessary <span id="fr_1164"></span>[1](#fn_1155.md) *that* how much soever
scantier <span id="fr_1165"></span>[2](#fn_1156.md) clothing they are able
to make a beginning *of*, the better they act. 2. Beside (illâ) <span
id="fr_1166"></span>[3](#fn_1157.md) something become old *and* washed,
anything new is not proper for *the purpose* that they *may* let *it* go
upon a dead body.

3\. For in the commentary of the Vendîdâ*d* <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[4](#fn_1158.md) it asserts that, if they *shall* pass
on to a dead body as much as a woman's spindle makes for a single
thread, with the exception of that which is unavoidable, for every
single thread a black snake hangs, in that *other* world, on to the
liver of that person who has made a beginning of the clothing. 4.
Likewise, that dead *person* becomes his antagonist (‘*h*aʓ̣m), and hangs
similarly <span id="fr_1168"></span>[5](#fn_1159.md) upon *his* skirt, and
speaks thus: 'This clothing, which thou hast put on my body, devours
*me, having* become worms and noxious creatures. 5. *My* name *was* put
upon a sacred cake <span id="fr_1169"></span>[6](#fn_1160.md), the fourth
*day*, with a Ya*s*t, so that *there*

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

might be alike a benefit therefrom for my soul, and it might be alike
unnecessary for thee to bear this torment (’haDHâb).' 6. Owing to that,
many sorrows come to that person, and he has no advantage from it. 7.
Therefore, it is necessary to act *with* caution (i’htiyâ*t*), so that,
how much soever the clothing be scantier <span
id="fr_1170"></span>[1](#fn_1161.md), they *may* make a beginning *of it*.

8\. And as many as shall be able to walk after the bier (tâbût) and
corpse shall walk. 9. Because every step that they go after a corpse is
a good work of three hundred stîrs <span
id="fr_1171"></span>[2](#fn_1162.md); *and* every stîr is four dirhams, in
such manner that three hundred stîrs are a thousand *and* two hundred
dirhams <span id="fr_1172"></span>[3](#fn_1163.md). 10. For every single
step *there* is thus much good work.
