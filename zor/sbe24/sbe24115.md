### CHAPTER XXVII.

1\. The twenty-seventh subject is this, that is, if any affair comes
forward, that they *should* thoroughly understand <span
id="fr_1250"></span>[2](#fn_1240) whether it be a good work, or a sin.
2. In that manner it becomes better that they make an evasion on the
spot <span id="fr_1251"></span>[3](#fn_1241), until a time *when* they
make *it* known with accuracy <span id="fr_1252"></span>[4](#fn_1242)
that that affair is a sin or a reward. 3. If they perform any affair
without knowing *this*, although it be a good work, it becomes a sin for
them.

4\. For it is declared in revelation, that, except that which they
enquire of the high-priests, no affair whatever is proper to perform. 5.
Whatever wisdom *there be* for any one from his own head is only one;
then, *as* two wisdoms are more than one <span
id="fr_1253"></span>[5](#fn_1243), it therefore makes *it* expedient to
enquire of the high-priests.
