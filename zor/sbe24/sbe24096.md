### CHAPTER VIII.

1\. The eighth subject is this, that it is necessary to maintain the
religion by rule (dastûr), and to practise obedience to the commands of
the high-priests; *and* every duty that *people* perform they *should*
perform by their authority.

2\. For it is declared in the good religion, that, if they accomplish as
many good works as the leaves of the trees, *or* the sand*-grains* of
the desert, *or* the drops (qa*t*rah) of rain, which they do not perform
by command of the high-priests, *or* to their satisfaction, no merit
whatever attains to their souls, and *for* the good works they have done
they obtain sin *as* a recompense. 3. While *such a one* is living it is
not proper to call him righteous, and when he dies he does not attain to
heaven, and not a single archangel comes <span
id="fr_1138"></span>[4](#fn_1130.md) near him. 4. He does not make his
escape from the hands of the demons and Aharman, and he

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

does not obtain a release from hell. 5. Because duties *and* good
works <span id="fr_1139"></span>[1](#fn_1131.md) attain to the soul *on*
those occasions when they perform *them* with the authority of the
high-priests and those acquainted with the religion, and *when* they
give them one-tenth of those good works <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[2](#fn_1132.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1130"></span>[266:4](sbe24096.htm#fr_1138.md) Lp, B29 have
'goes.'

<span id="fn_1131"></span>[267:1](sbe24096.htm#fr_1139.md) That is, the
merit of performing them.

<span id="fn_1132"></span>[267:2](sbe24096.htm#fr_1140.md) The principles
of blind submission of the laity to the priesthood, and complete
abnegation of private judgment, which pervade the whole of the Sad Dar,
are especially conspicuous in this chapter. They are the ideas prevalent
in the darkest ages of the religion, which have now nearly disappeared
with the spread of true knowledge as in other faiths.
