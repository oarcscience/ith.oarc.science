### CHAPTER XCIV.

1\. The ninety-fourth subject is this, when a person confers a benefit
*or* kindness upon any one, it is necessary that *the latter should*
understand the value of it, and lay the obligation (minnat) upon
himself; and, if he be able, he *should* provide a benefit to that
amount (miqdâr) for that *person*.

2\. It is declared in revelation, *that*, when a person confers a
benefit upon any one, Hôrmazd <span id="fr_1570"></span>[1](#fn_1559.md)
gives him ten times as much, as an equivalent. 3. And, if *the other* be
not understanding <span id="fr_1571"></span>[2](#fn_1560.md) the justice
*of this*, it is related in the commentary of the Avesta *in* this
manner, that it is a great sin for him. 4. And Aharman <span
id="fr_1572"></span>[3](#fn_1561.md) speaks like this, namely: 'That sinner
is akin to me; *in* the end he will come into my hands; I will not give
him into the hands of any demon, *but* I *will* inflict punishment
*with* my own hands.' 5. *And* the chief priest <span
id="fr_1573"></span>[4](#fn_1562.md) says it is necessary for all
Zaratu*s*tians that they keep themselves far from this sin.
