### CHAPTER XXVI.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Is a blind eye worse,
or a blind mind (dîl)? 3. Is the ill-informed worse, or the
bad-tempered?'

4\. The spirit of wisdom answered (5) thus: 'He who is blind-eyed, when
he has understanding in anything, *and* accomplishes learning, is to be
considered as sound-eyed. 6. *And* he who is sound-eyed, when he has no
knowledge *and* understanding <span id="fr_288"></span>[1](#fn_284), and
even that which they teach him he does not accept, then that is worse
than even a blind eye.

7\. 'The ill-tempered is less evil <span id="fr_289"></span>[2](#fn_285)
than the ill-informed; (8) because the ill-tempered, except by a decree,
is not able to seize anything away from any one; (9) and *as to* the
ill-informed man, his desire of every kind is then <span
id="fr_290"></span>[3](#fn_286) for oppression and plunder. 10.
Concerning him who is ill-informed *it* is declared that, apart from
predestination, he is born *free* from fresh understanding <span
id="fr_291"></span>[4](#fn_287)'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_284"></span>[56:1](sbe24032.htm#fr_288) L19 has 'when he
has no knowledge of anything.'

<span id="fn_285"></span>[56:2](sbe24032.htm#fr_289) L19 has 'is
better.'

<span id="fn_286"></span>[56:3](sbe24032.htm#fr_290) That is, when he
has a decree in his favour.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[56:4](sbe24032.htm#fr_291) § 10 is found only
in TD2. It probably means that an ill-informed man is not likely to
acquire any knowledge beyond that which is unavoidable.
