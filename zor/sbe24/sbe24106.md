### CHAPTER XVIII.

1\. The eighteenth subject is this, that it is necessary for mankind to
make an endeavour, so that they *may* espouse a wife in *their* youth
and beget a child. 2. And for women, in like manner, it is necessary
that *there* should be a longing (ra*gh*bat) for espousing a husband.

3\. Because it is declared in revelation <span
id="fr_1194"></span>[2](#fn_1185), *that* every duty and good work a
child performs becomes the father's and mother's, just like those which
they have performed with their own hands. 4. The meaning (ma’hnî) of pûr
('a son') is that which signifies pûl ('a bridge') <span
id="fr_1195"></span>[3](#fn_1186), for by this bridge they arrive at
that *other* world. 5. If *there* be no child for any one they call *him
one with* a severed bridge, that is, the

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

way for him *to* that *other* world is severed, and he is not able to
attain to that world. 6. At the head of the *K*inva*d* bridge he shall
remain; although he has performed much duty and good works he is not
able to make a passage over the *K*inva*d* bridge, and they do not make
up his account and reckoning. 7. And every archangel that comes forward
*to* that place first asks these words, that is, 'Hast thou brought thy
own substitute visibly into the world, or not?' 8. When he has not
brought *it*, they will pass over him, and his soul will remain, *in*
that place <span id="fr_1196"></span>[1](#fn_1187), full of anguish and
grief (*gh*am).

9\. A similitude (miTHâl) of it is like that which *happens when* any
one may be in a wilderness, and *there* may be fear of wild animals and
creatures, and near to him may be his own town, *but* a river of water
is in front <span id="fr_1197"></span>[2](#fn_1188), and it is not
possible to make a passage over that river, *as* a bridge is fallen in,
and he is not able to arrive at that town, *but* he is always upon the
bank (sar*t*) *speaking* thus <span id="fr_1198"></span>[3](#fn_1189):
'Would that the bridge would become perfect!'

10\. The duty as to children <span id="fr_1199"></span>[4](#fn_1190) is
in this aggregate <span id="fr_1200"></span>[5](#fn_1191). 11.
Therefore, the creator Hôrmazd *has* granted unto men that, if *there*
be any one to whom sickness from heaven may occur, and *there* be no
provision of a child for him, he *has* commanded him that he *should*
make some one a son of his own, as <span
id="fr_1201"></span>[6](#fn_1192) a friend of *his* soul, and *should*
receive a child, because every duty *can be* delegated. 12. That person
is in place of a

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

child, and every duty and good work that he performs shall be just like
that *which* is performed by one's own hand.

13\. And, finally, if any one departs from the world (dunyâ) <span
id="fr_1202"></span>[1](#fn_1193) and possesses no adopted child, it is
incumbent on the priests and high-priests and his relations to appoint
his adopted son, and it is necessary to bring some one in sight on that
account, so that his soul *may* spring away from the torment of hell.
14. Because, every time that his relations do not pay attention *to
this*, when they proceed to that *other* world, the soul of that person
hangs about them and speaks thus: 'I left with you something that I had
collected and borne trouble for in many years, and you seized upon *it*,
and put *it* into your own expenditure (‘*h*arg), and did not seek
for <span id="fr_1203"></span>[2](#fn_1194) mercy (*s*afqat) on my soul.
15. *In* the same manner as I have remained, delayed (maûqûf) *in* this
place, I *will* not let you pass; so that you *will* make no passage
over the *K*inva*d* bridge till the sacred being takes my rights away
from you.' 16. Then the angel Rashn and the angel Mihir <span
id="fr_1204"></span>[3](#fn_1195) make up their reckoning, *and, as to*
whatever those persons have seized upon from the *other's*
property <span id="fr_1205"></span>[4](#fn_1196), for every single dînâr
the account makes four, and they take away the equivalent. 17. And, *as*
in that world *there* are no gold and silver, they take away from their
souls the good works that they have done, and they give *them* to the
soul of this *other*. 18. Still, while *others* do not appoint the
adopted son, they are not able to pass over the *K*inva*d* bridge, nor
to arrive at their own station.

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

19\. There is no duty whatever more incumbent on relations than this
duty, and every time that they appoint an adopted son *for* any one it
is just as though they have made the deceased alive; and there are no
limit (‘hadd) and end (nihâyat) of their good works.

<span id="fn_1186"></span>[278:3](sbe24106.htm#fr_1195) This fanciful
explanation must be derived from a Pahlavi source, as it is only in that
language that the two words are written precisely alike.
