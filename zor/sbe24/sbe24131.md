### CHAPTER XLIII.

1\. The forty-third subject is this, that it is necessary to make an
endeavour to kill noxious creatures *and* reptiles (‘ha*s*arât) of the
earth; because, in revelation <span id="fr_1322"></span>[1](#fn_1311),
it is put *forth as* a great good work.

2\. Especially these five things:—One is the frog in the water, the
second is the snake and scorpion, the third is the ant (mar*k*is) <span
id="fr_1323"></span>[2](#fn_1312) that flies, the fourth is the *common*
ant (môr*k*ah), and the fifth is the mouse. 3. Therefore <span
id="fr_1324"></span>[3](#fn_1313), every time that they bring a frog up,
out of the water, and make *it* dry, and, after (ba’hd) that, kill it,
it is a good work of a thousand *and* two hundred dirhams *in*
weight <span id="fr_1325"></span>[4](#fn_1314). 4. And every time that
they kill a snake, and recite the Avesta that is *appointed* for that
*occasion* <span id="fr_1326"></span>[5](#fn_1315), it is

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

just as though they have slain an apostate (âshmô*gh*). 5. For every one
who kills a *flying* ant (mar*k*is) it is as much good work as *for* any
one who is reciting *inward* prayer *for* ten days. 6. Among the
creatures of Aharman nothing whatever is more harmful than this; for, if
it dies in the air (havâ) it becomes a gnat, if it dies in the dust it
becomes a worm, if it dies in the water it becomes a leech <span
id="fr_1327"></span>[1](#fn_1316), if it dies among the excavators of
flesh it becomes a venomous snake (mâr-i af’haî), and if it dies in dung
it becomes creeping *things*. 7. *For* every one who kills a
corn-dragging ant it is as much good work as *for* any one *who* recites
the Hôrmazd Ya*s*t. 8. And *for* every one who kills many noxious
creatures it is as much good work as *for* a priest who performs the
ceremonial of the sacred beings; both good works are equal. 9. *For*
every one who kills a mouse it is as much good work as *if* four lions
are killed <span id="fr_1328"></span>[2](#fn_1317). 10. Therefore, it is
incumbent on every one to make an effort to kill a noxious creature.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1311"></span>[306:1](sbe24131.htm#fr_1322) See Vend. XIV,
9-17, XVIII, 144-146.

<span id="fn_1312"></span>[306:2](sbe24131.htm#fr_1323) If mar*k*is were
Pahlavi, it would mean 'the deadly thing.' Possibly 'the locust'
(mala‘*h*) is meant, but the description in § 6 is rather perplexing.

<span id="fn_1313"></span>[306:3](sbe24131.htm#fr_1324) Lp omits
'therefore,' and B29 has 'and.'

<span id="fn_1314"></span>[306:4](sbe24131.htm#fr_1325) See Chap, XII, 9
n. The frog is considered noxious because it is supposed to injure the
water, being generally found in stagnant pools which are unwholesome.

<span id="fn_1315"></span>[306:5](sbe24131.htm#fr_1326) An Avesta
passage of about thirty words, to be used on such occasions, is to be
found in the Rivâyats, but is still unedited.

<span id="fn_1316"></span>[307:1](sbe24131.htm#fr_1327) B29 has
'hedgehog.'

<span id="fn_1317"></span>[307:2](sbe24131.htm#fr_1328) Ants and mice
(or rats) are considered noxious on account of the damage they do to
certain crops and farmers’ stores.
