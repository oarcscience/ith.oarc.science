### CHAPTER XXXVII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Through how many ways
and motives of good works do people arrive most at heaven?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'The first good work is
liberality <span id="fr_392"></span>[5](#fn_387.md). 5. The second, truth.
6. The third, thankfulness. 7. The fourth, contentment. 8. The fifth,
wanting to produce welfare for the good, and becoming a friend to every
one. 9. The sixth, being without doubt as to this, that the

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

sky and earth and every benefit of the worldly and spiritual
*existences* are owing to the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*. 10. The seventh,
*being so* as to the unquestionableness of this <span
id="fr_393"></span>[1](#fn_388.md), that all misery and affliction are
owing to Aharman the wicked, who is accursed. 11. The eighth, freedom
from doubt as to the resurrection and future existence. 12. The ninth,
who for love of the soul effects <span id="fr_394"></span>[2](#fn_389.md) a
next-of-kin marriage. 13. The tenth, who arranges adoption <span

industry. 15. The twelfth, who is without doubt in this pure, good
religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers. 16. The thirteenth, who is kindly
regardful as to the ability and means of every one. 17. The fourteenth,
who perceives <span id="fr_396"></span>[4](#fn_391.md) the kind regard of
the good, and becomes himself, also, kindly regardful as to the goodness
which *one* wants among the good. 18. The fifteenth, who seeks the
affection of the good. 19. The sixteenth, who keeps malice and
uncharitableness far from *his* mind. 20. The seventeenth, who bears no
improper envy. 21. The eighteenth, who forms no desire of lust. 22. The

brings no distress into the affairs Of a departed and unassisted *one*
(avi*g*î*d*) <span id="fr_397"></span>[5](#fn_392.md). 24. The
twenty-first, who

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

lets <span id="fr_398"></span>[1](#fn_393.md) no wrath into *his* body. 25.
The twenty-second, who commits no sin on account of disgrace <span
id="fr_399"></span>[2](#fn_394.md). 26. The twenty-third, who forms no
desire of lethargy on account of laziness. 27. The twenty-fourth, who is
without doubt as to the sacred beings. 28. The twenty-fifth, who is
without doubt as to the existence of heaven and hell, and the account
which is *to be rendered* by the soul, the glory which is in heaven, and
the misery which is in hell. 29. The twenty-sixth, who abstains <span
id="fr_400"></span>[3](#fn_395.md) from slander and envious looks. 30. The
twenty-seventh, who causes the happiness of himself, and gives happy
advancement also to others. 31. The twenty-eighth, who becomes the
help <span id="fr_401"></span>[4](#fn_396.md) of the good, and accuser of
the bad. 32. The twenty-ninth, who restrains himself from deceit and
evil (dû*s*îh) <span id="fr_402"></span>[5](#fn_397.md). 33. The thirtieth,
who does not speak false and untrue <span
id="fr_403"></span>[6](#fn_398.md). 34. The thirty-first, who restrains
himself firmly from promise-breaking. 35. The thirty-second, who, for
the sake of seeking his own benefit and happiness, causes the abstinence
of others from evil. 36. *And* the thirty-third, who provides lodging
accommodation for the sick and secluded <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_387"></span>[73:5](sbe24043.htm#fr_392.md) Compare Chap. IV,
which divides good works into seven classes.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[74:1](sbe24043.htm#fr_393.md) By the
transposition of two words L19 has 'freedom from doubt as to this.'

<span id="fn_389"></span>[74:2](sbe24043.htm#fr_394.md) Whether for
himself, or for another, is uncertain (see Chap. IV, 4 n).

<span id="fn_390"></span>[74:3](sbe24043.htm#fr_395.md) Nêr. explains in
Sanskrit, thus: 'that is, whoever becomes a spirit childless, maintains
any man, with his wealth, for his fame and his lineage, then thus the
soul, too, is for an increase of good works.'

<span id="fn_391"></span>[74:4](sbe24043.htm#fr_396.md) L19 transposes the
two verbs, 'perceives' and 'wants.'

<span id="fn_392"></span>[74:5](sbe24043.htm#fr_397.md) Nêr. reads
*hv*azî*d*, which he identifies with Pers. ‘*h*azîd, 'concealed, <span
id="page_75">p. 75</span> secluded;' and which might also be taken in
the sense of one who has 'crawled,' meaning a young child; but the
identification is doubtful.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[75:1](sbe24043.htm#fr_398.md) L19 has 'keeps.'

<span id="fn_394"></span>[75:2](sbe24043.htm#fr_399.md) That is, 'for fear
of disgrace.'

<span id="fn_395"></span>[75:3](sbe24043.htm#fr_400.md) L19 has 'restrains
himself.'

<span id="fn_396"></span>[75:4](sbe24043.htm#fr_401.md) L19 has 'helper.'

<span id="fn_397"></span>[75:5](sbe24043.htm#fr_402.md) L19 has
*hv*ad-dôshî, 'self-conceit.'

<span id="fn_398"></span>[75:6](sbe24043.htm#fr_403.md) See Chap. XXXVI, 29
n.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[75:7](sbe24043.htm#fr_404.md) See Chap. XV, 6 n.
