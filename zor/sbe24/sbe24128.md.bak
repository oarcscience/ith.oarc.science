### CHAPTER XL.

1\. The fortieth subject is this, that it is not desirable to distress
*one's* priest, *or* father, *or* mother; and, if *people* perceive much
trouble, disquietude, and harm *arising* from them, it is certainly not
desirable that they *should* give them back a reply with any
aggravation. 2. Because their satisfaction is connected with the
satisfaction of the sacred being, *and* every time that *people*
distress them they have

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

distressed Hôrmazd, the good *and* propitious. 3. It is not possible
*for* any duty *or* good work to extend to the spiritual *existences*
while *one* does not make those *guardians* satisfied, and it is not
possible (mumkin) that any one *should* repay these three persons all
*their* dues.

4\. In the commentary of the Hâ*d*ôkht *Nask* it says:—Mâ âzârayôi*s*,
Zarathu*s*tra! mâ Pourushaspem, mâ Dughdhôvãm, mâ aêthrapaiti*s* <span
id="fr_1302"></span>[1](#fn_1292.md), 'it is nor desirable that thou, O
Zaratu*s*t! *shouldest* distress *thy* father, *or* mother, *or*
priest.'

5\. Therefore, three times every day it is indispensable *for one* to
fold *his* arms <span id="fr_1303"></span>[2](#fn_1293.md) in the presence
of these three persons, *and* to say:—'What is your will (murâd)? So
that I *may* think and speak and do it. 6. If *what* was not proper has
come from me of itself, it is necessary that you make a righteous gift
on our behalf.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1292"></span>[302:1](sbe24128.htm#fr_1302.md) This Avesta
passage is not known to be extant elsewhere, and its orthography has
been corrected in accordance with the translation attached to it by the
author of Sd. In La, Lp, J15 the first two names are in the genitive,
and the third is accusative; B29 differs by putting the third name also
in the genitive; the last word being accusative in all. Pourushaspa and
Dughdhôva (?) were the names of the father and mother of Zarathu*s*tra,
and the latter name has not previously been found in the Avesta texts,
but is known only from Pahlavi and Persian writings.

<span id="fn_1293"></span>[302:2](sbe24128.htm#fr_1303.md) That is, to
stand in an attitude of obedient reverence.
