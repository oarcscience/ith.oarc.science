### CHAPTER IV.

1\. And *as to* that which is asked (2) thus: 'When I always see that
all things ever arise from the *celestial* sphere and stars, (3) and who
created this sphere, then it is like that *which* those of the
Vîrô*d* <span id="fr_664"></span>[3](#fn_656.md) religion say, that he
created good and evil. 4. If Aharman

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

created *anything*, how did he become able to create the effect of these
marvellous things, (5) *and* why *is it* when they are stars by which
assistance of virtue is always bestowed? 6. If Aûha*r*ma*zd* and Aharman
created in conference, then that way *it* is manifest that Aûha*r*ma*zd*
is an accomplice *and* confederate, with Aharman, in the harm and evil
which ever arise from the *celestial* sphere.' 7. The answer is this,
(8) that the *celestial* sphere is the place of the divinities (baghân),
who are the distributers of happiness, from which they always justly
bestow their distribution of every happiness. 9. And the forms of the
seven planets (star) are witches who rush below them, despoilers who are
antagonistic distributers, (10) whose scriptural name is Gadûg <span
id="fr_665"></span>[1](#fn_657.md).

11\. *Through* the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd* *was* the arrangement of these
creatures and creation, methodically *and* sagaciously, and for the sake
of the continuance of the renovation *of the universe*. 12. As the evil
spirit *was* entangled in the sky, that fiend, with evil astuteness
*and* with lying falsehood, encompassed <span
id="fr_666"></span>[2](#fn_658.md) *and* mingled with the light, *together*
with the fiends of crimes of many kinds, who are those of a gloomy race,
*thinking* thus: 'I *will* make these creatures *and* creation of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* extinct, or I must make *them* for my own.'

13\. Those luminaries, the highest of those of the

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

good *being*, became aware, by means of omniscience, of the blemishing
operation and the lies *and* falsehoods of the fiend, (14) *and* of this
too, that is, of what extent *was* this power of his, by which this
blemishing operation and work of ruin creep on <span
id="fr_667"></span>[1](#fn_659), (15.md) so that, henceforth, *there*
exists no power whatever for its restoration, which is *free* from the
complete daubing of restraint, pain, and entanglement that is inside the
sky.

16\. It is they <span id="fr_668"></span>[2](#fn_660.md) who are
sagaciously mingled by him (the good being) with the substance of the
luminaries, because that fiend encompassed and *was* entangled with his
luminaries, therefore all his powers and resources are for the purpose
of not allowing the fiends of crimes of many kinds their own performance
of what is desirable for them each separately; (17) such as the fiendish
venom of the noxious creatures which the four elements (zahakân),
pertaining to Aûha*r*ma*zd*, \[keep enveloped <span
id="fr_669"></span>[3](#fn_661.md). 18. For if this fiendish venom of the
noxious creatures\] does not remain entangled \[with the four elements
of the bodily formations pertaining to Aûha*r*ma*zd*\]—which are water,
fire, earth, and air—*it is* just as though they came to the sky *and*
spiritual existence. 19.

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *And* if they
attained to spirituality and a disembodied existence, it would not be
possible for those creatures of Aûha*r*ma*zd* to avoid *and* escape from
that demoniacal venom of theirs. 20. It would be in the grasp
(grôhê) <span id="fr_670"></span>[1](#fn_662.md) and mingled with the
breath (vâ*d*) of mankind *and* the other creatures, *and their*
restoration, support, increase, *and* growth would not be possible.

21\. So they <span id="fr_671"></span>[2](#fn_663.md) also keep those
planets enveloped in light, because the fiendish venom of the noxious
creatures is in the substance of *those* luminaries. 22. On account of
that, too, the existence of somewhat of advantage is manifest from the
serpent species, which are dissolving venom from the multitudes of other
wild animals *and* noxious creatures <span
id="fr_672"></span>[3](#fn_664.md). 23. So also from the planets; on
account of the commingling of the inferior splendour of *those*
luminaries, benefit is manifested by them.

24\. A similitude of these planets *and* the benefit which they always
bestow (25) is such as the brigands (gadûgân) <span
id="fr_673"></span>[4](#fn_665.md) *and* highwaymen who interrupt the path
of traders in a caravan. 26. They abstract important things *from* many,
(27) *and* do not grant and give *them* to the diligent *and* worthy,
but to sinners, idlers, courtezans, paramours, *and* the unworthy.

28\. *Observe* this, too, that this performance of good works which
astrologers compute and state from those planets is for this reason,
(29) when they have not preferred the method of the divinities

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (baghân) who are
distributing welfare, and that, also, of the five constellations
pertaining to Aûha*r*ma*zd*—which are the great *one* <span
id="fr_674"></span>[1](#fn_666.md) that is supreme and measurable <span
id="fr_675"></span>[2](#fn_667.md), Haptôiring <span
id="fr_676"></span>[3](#fn_668.md), created by Mazda <span
id="fr_677"></span>[4](#fn_669.md), *and* the stars Vanand <span
id="fr_678"></span>[5](#fn_670.md), Satavês <span
id="fr_679"></span>[6](#fn_671.md), *and* Tî*s*tar <span
id="fr_680"></span>[7](#fn_672)—as regards the brigands (gadûgân.md) <span
id="fr_681"></span>[8](#fn_673.md) *and* distributers of evil. 30. And
those are the five planets that rush below them in the shape of stars,
and they keep *them* enveloped in light, which are Saturn, Jupiter,
Mars, Venus, and Mercury. 31. Since the supreme constellation, the great
*one* of the north-opposing <span id="fr_682"></span>[9](#fn_674) (32.md)
Haptôiring, is opposing Saturn, (33) Haptôiring, created by Ma*zd*a, is
opposing Jupiter, (34) Vanand, the smiter of noxious creatures, is
opposing Mars, (35) the star Satavês is opposing Venus, (36) *and* the
star Tî*s*tar is opposing the planetary Mercury <span
id="fr_683"></span>[10](#fn_675), (37.md) the welfare, which they say is
from those brigands (gadûgân), is from those five constellations
pertaining

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

to Aûha*r*ma*zd*, (38) as they obtain the triumph of much power *and*
little injury.

39\. And for the sake of not leaving these five planets to their own
wills, they are bound *by* the creator, Aûha*r*ma*zd*, each one by two
threads (*g*îk) to the sun (Mihir) and moon. 40. And their forward
motion and backward motion are owing to the same cause. 41. There are
*some* whose length of thread is longer, such as Saturn and Jupiter,
(42) and there are *some of* which *it* is shorter, such as Mercury and
Venus. 43. Every *time* when they go to the end of the threads, they
draw *them* back from behind, (44) and they do not allow them to proceed
by their own wills, (45) so that they *may* not injure the creatures.

4.6. And those two fiends that are greatly powerful, who are opponents
of the planetary sun and moon, move below the splendour of *those* two
luminaries <span id="fr_684"></span>[1](#fn_676.md). 47. Another—even that
which is called the brigand (gadûg) of the stars, as regards the welfare
that exists <span id="fr_685"></span>[2](#fn_677.md)—is likewise confined
below the splendour of the sun. 48. And when it <span
id="fr_686"></span>[3](#fn_678.md) gets far from control, it commits damage
and harm on the constellation into which it springs, *and* on the
quarter which is the particular concern of that constellation, (49)
until it

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

becomes again, a second *time*, bound *and* fettered *to* the sun.

50\. The statement which they offer about it <span
id="fr_687"></span>[1](#fn_679) (51.md) is this, the conflict of the
superior beings within the star station. 52. Out of the inferior of
those are the conflicts of Tî*s*tar and the demon Spen*z*agar <span
id="fr_688"></span>[2](#fn_680), (53.md) *of* the fire Vâzi*s*t <span
id="fr_689"></span>[3](#fn_681.md) and the demon A*v*âush <span
id="fr_690"></span>[4](#fn_682), (54.md) *and of* other good spirits with
gloomy ones, for the formation of rain and allotment of welfare to the
creatures.

55\. Below them are mankind and cattle, noxious creatures and deadly
*ones* <span id="fr_691"></span>[5](#fn_683.md), and other creatures that
are good and bad. 56. Because propensities (gada*s*ni) are mingled with
mankind, (57) which are greed, lust, malice, wrath, and lethargy, (58)
wisdom, temper, skill, knowledge, understanding, and intellect, (59) as
the good influences and bad influences are called, which are the causes
of good works and sin.

60\. All this welfare of the creatures <span
id="fr_692"></span>[6](#fn_684.md) is specially owing to the creator of the
creatures, (61) who is himself the healer and perfect ruler, the
maintainer of protection, nourisher, and caretaker, preserving his own
creatures. 62. And, for his own creatures, he

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

has thoroughly created and taught the means of preservation from evil,
and the appliances for abstaining from crime.

63\. A semblance, too, of him is such as a wise orchard-owner and
gardener who wishes to diminish the wild animals and birds which are
mischievous and destructive for his orchard by spoiling the fruit of the
trees. 64. And that wise gardener, effacing (padasâê) his own little
trouble, for the sake of keeping those mischievous wild animals away
from his own orchard, arranges the appliances which are necessary for
the capture of those wild animals, (65) such as springes, traps, and
snares for birds. 66. So that when a wild animal sees the snare, and
wishes to proceed with suspicion of it, through unconsciousness of the
springe and trap he is captured therein.

67\. This is certain, that, when a wild animal falls into a trap, *it*
is not a victory of the trap, but that of the arranger of the trap, (68)
*and* through him the wild animal is captured in the trap. 69. The
proprietor *and* orchard-owner, who is the arranger of the trap, is
aware through sagacity that the wild animal is powerful, *and* to what
extent and how long a time. 70. The power and strength of that wild
animal, which are in its body, are exhausted and poured *out* by
struggling, as much as it is able, in demolishing the trap and *in*
endeavouring to destroy *and* spoil the springe. 71. And when, on
account of imperfect strength, its power of struggling totters *and* is
exhausted, that wise gardener then, by his own will and his own result
of determination, wisely throws that wild animal out of the trap, with
*its* existing nature *and* exhausted strength. 72. And

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

he consigns his own trap and springe, rearranged *and* undamaged, back
to the storehouse.

73\. Even like him is the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*, who is the preserver of
creations and arranger of creatures <span
id="fr_693"></span>[1](#fn_685.md), the disabler of the evil original
evolution <span id="fr_694"></span>[2](#fn_686.md) and protector of his own
orchard from the injurer. 74. The mischievous wild animal, which is the
spoiler of the orchard, is that accursed Aharman who is the hurrier
*and* disturber of the creatures. 75. The good trap is the sky, in which
the good creations are lodging, (76) *and* in which the evil spirit and
*his* rudimentary <span id="fr_695"></span>[3](#fn_687.md) miscreations are
captured. 77. And *pertaining* to the springe and trap of the wild
animal, who is mischievous owing to his own wilfulness, is the exhauster
(78) time that, for the struggling of Aharman and his powers *and*
resources, is for the long period <span id="fr_696"></span>[4](#fn_688.md)
(79) which, through the struggling of the wild animal in the springe and
trap, is an exhaustion of its strength. 80. The sole <span
id="fr_697"></span>[5](#fn_689.md)

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

creator of the creatures arranges a preservation again, which is the
preparation of an eternal happy progress *free* from his adversary,
which that wise orchard-owner *does with* his own trap and springe <span
id="fr_698"></span>[1](#fn_690.md).

81\. Then <span id="fr_699"></span>[2](#fn_691.md) the scanty power and
want of ability of that fiend for it, in his struggling for the
luminaries, are manifest even from this. 82. When as with lying
falsehood he thought thus <span id="fr_700"></span>[3](#fn_692.md): 'I
*will* make this sky and earth and the creatures of Aûha*r*ma*zd*
extinct, or I *will* turn *them* from their own nature *and* bring
*them* to my own,' (83) even then, with *all* the power, desire of
destruction, and perpetual struggling of the fiend, no slaughter
whatever *by* the demons is *free* from effectual limits; it is this
earth and sky, and these creatures, (84) *that* are propagating from few
to many, as is manifest, (85) and innumerable *persons* are convinced of
it. 86. For, if in this struggling any victory should have specially
occurred, it would have been impossible to attain from few to many.

87\. Moreover, if the births of the worldly *existence* are mostly
manifest through the occurrence of death therein, even then it is seen
that that death is not a complete dissolution of existence, but a
necessity of *going* from place to place, from duty to duty <span
id="fr_701"></span>[4](#fn_693.md). 88. For, as the existence of all these
creations is *derived* from the four elements, *it* is manifest to the
sight *that* those worldly bodies of theirs are to be mingled again with
the four elements. 89. The spiritual *parts*, which are the rudimentary
appliances of the life

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

stimulating the body, are mingled with the soul—(90) on account of unity
of nature they are not dispersed—(91) and the soul is accountable
(amârhômand) for its own deeds. 92. Its treasurers <span
id="fr_702"></span>[1](#fn_694.md), also, unto whom its good works and
offences are intrusted, advance there for a contest. 93. When the
treasurer of the good works is of greater strength, she preserves it, by
her victory, from the hands of the accuser <span
id="fr_703"></span>[2](#fn_695.md), *and* settles *it* for the great throne
and the mutual delightfulness of the luminaries; (94) and it is assisted
eternally in virtuous progress. 95. And when the treasurer of its
offences is of greater strength, it is dragged, through her victory,
*away* from the hands of the helper <span
id="fr_704"></span>[3](#fn_696), (96.md) *and* is delivered up to the place
of thirst and hunger and the agonizing abode of disease <span
id="fr_705"></span>[4](#fn_697.md). 97. And, even there, those feeble good
works, which *were* practised by it in the worldly *existence*, are not
useless to it; (98) for, owing to *this* same reason, that hunger and
thirst and punishment are *inflicted* on it proportionately to the sin,
*and* not lawlessly, (99) because *there* is a watcher <span
id="fr_706"></span>[5](#fn_698.md)

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

of the infliction of its punishment. 100. And, ultimately, the
compassionate creator, who is the forgiver of the creatures, does not
leave any good creature captive in the hands of the enemy <span
id="fr_707"></span>[1](#fn_699.md). 101. *But*, one day <span
id="fr_708"></span>[2](#fn_700.md), he saves even those who are sinful,
*and* those of the righteous through atonement for sin, by the hands of
the purifiers, *and* makes *them* proceed on the happy course which is
eternal.

102\. The conclusion is this, that the creator is the healer and perfect
ruler, the maintainer and nourisher, protecting *and* preserving the
creatures <span id="fr_709"></span>[3](#fn_701.md); not a producer of the
disease, a causer of the pain, and an inflicter of the punishment of his
own creatures. 103. And it is more explicitly written below, with the
arrangement of the two original evolutions <span
id="fr_710"></span>[4](#fn_702.md), among the assertors of the
non-existence of a sacred being <span id="fr_711"></span>[5](#fn_703.md),
and the contemplators of unity <span id="fr_712"></span>[6](#fn_704.md).

104\. As ordered and requested by you it is provided (padarâst); do you
direct and observe *it* with kind regards. 105. Because, as written
above <span id="fr_713"></span>[7](#fn_705.md) by us, I do not hold the
station of teaching, but really that of learning. 106. Even this
teaching of doctrines is that which *was* obtained by me, through the
religion of wisdom <span id="fr_714"></span>[8](#fn_706.md), from the
writing (nipîk) of Âtûr-pâ*d*îyâvand <span
id="fr_715"></span>[9](#fn_707.md), and is here indicated. 107. And his
teachings

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

are in the Dînka*rd* <span id="fr_716"></span>[1](#fn_708.md) manuscript
(nipîk), which the supremely learned Âtû*r*-frôbag <span
id="fr_717"></span>[2](#fn_709.md), son of Farukh-zâ*d*, who was the leader
of those of the good religion, explained out of *his* knowledge of the
religion, *and* which consists of a thousand subjects <span
id="fr_718"></span>[3](#fn_710.md).

108\. Of that, too, which is asked by you about unlimitedness and
limitation, I have written below <span id="fr_719"></span>[4](#fn_711.md),
through the will of the sacred beings.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_656"></span>[127:3](sbe24074.htm#fr_664.md) Compare Sans.
viruddha, 'perverse, contradictory,' or Pers. bulûd, 'antiquity.' It is
possible that Muhammadanism is alluded to, as that religion is hardly
ever mentioned by name in Pahlavi writings, probably from motives of
policy.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[128:1](sbe24074.htm#fr_665.md) Av. gadha, a term
for 'a brigand' which is used in conjunction with witches and other evil
beings in the Srôsh Yt. Hâ*d*ôkht, 5, 6.

<span id="fn_658"></span>[128:2](sbe24074.htm#fr_666.md) Supposing that the
Pâz. frawast (fravast in § 16) stands for Pahl. parvast, as in Chaps.
VIII, 96, 97, XIV, 73, XVI, 56, 60, 66-69, 71, 72; but as Nêr. uses
Sans. prasarpita, pravish*t*a, pravartita, samudgata, and samutpatita to
translate the word, he must have assumed that it stood for fra*z*ast
(Pahl. fra*g*ast, 'sprang forth').

<span id="fn_659"></span>[129:1](sbe24074.htm#fr_667.md) Sans. 'will
retreat,' as if Nêr. understood the pronoun 'his' to refer to the good
spirit, instead of the evil one; the application of the pronouns in §§
14, 15 being by no means clear in the original text.

<span id="fn_660"></span>[129:2](sbe24074.htm#fr_668.md) The spiritual
representatives of the luminaries, who are angels.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[129:3](sbe24074.htm#fr_669.md) The words in
brackets are omitted in AK, PB3, L23, so that §§ 17, 18, in those MSS.,
stand as follows:—'Since the fiendish venom of the noxious creatures,
that the four elements pertaining to Aûha*r*ma*zd*—which are water,
fire, earth, and air—have not entangled, is just as though they (the
creatures) came to the sky *and* spiritual *existence*.'

<span id="fn_662"></span>[130:1](sbe24074.htm#fr_670.md) Or grôhê may mean
'an assemblage.'

<span id="fn_663"></span>[130:2](sbe24074.htm#fr_671.md) The angels of the
luminaries.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[130:3](sbe24074.htm#fr_672.md) Which they eat,
and thereby diminish the number of such objectionable creatures.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[130:4](sbe24074.htm#fr_673.md) See § 10 n.

<span id="fn_666"></span>[131:1](sbe24074.htm#fr_674.md) Called 'the great
*one* of the middle of the sky' in Bd. II, 8, V, I, which has not yet
been identified, but may be Regulus or Orion.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[131:2](sbe24074.htm#fr_675.md) Sans. 'very
visible.'

<span id="fn_668"></span>[131:3](sbe24074.htm#fr_676.md) See Mkh. XLIX,
15-21, where it is called Haptôk-ring.

<span id="fn_669"></span>[131:4](sbe24074.htm#fr_677.md) This epithet is
often applied to Haptôiring, Vanand, and Satavês.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[131:5](sbe24074.htm#fr_678.md) See Mkh. XLIX,
12-14.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[131:6](sbe24074.htm#fr_679.md) See Mkh. LXII, 13.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[131:7](sbe24074.htm#fr_680.md) See Mkh. XLIX, 5,
6.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[131:8](sbe24074.htm#fr_681.md) The planetary
witches (see § 10).

<span id="fn_674"></span>[131:9](sbe24074.htm#fr_682.md) Or it may be
'planetary-opposing,' or 'north-accepting.' The dislocation, and
probable corruption, of these sections is due to Nêr., who evidently
considered the epithet mazdadhâta, 'created by Mazda,' as the name of
one of the constellations, and 'great' and 'supreme' as mere epithets of
Haptôiring. But he found it difficult to adapt the text to this opinion
of his.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[131:10](sbe24074.htm#fr_683.md) These oppositions
agree with those mentioned in Bd. V, 1, except that Haptôiring is there
opposed to Mars, and Vanand to Jupiter.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[132:1](sbe24074.htm#fr_684.md) Referring to the
supposed cause of eclipses, which are said to be occasioned by two dark
bodies revolving below the sun and moon, so as to pass between them and
the earth whenever an eclipse occurs (see Dd. LXIX).

<span id="fn_677"></span>[132:2](sbe24074.htm#fr_685.md) Referring to the
supposed injurious influence of comets which, as they usually appear one
at a time to the unassisted eye, are here assumed to be a single evil
being, the Mû*s*par of Bd. V, 1, 2.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[132:3](sbe24074.htm#fr_686.md) We should perhaps
say 'she,' as a drû*g*, 'fiend,' is usually considered to be a female
being, and the Mû*s*par or Mû*s*-pairika is a witch.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[133:1](sbe24074.htm#fr_687.md) Meaning, probably,
the reason given by the astrologers for the good works mentioned in §
28.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[133:2](sbe24074.htm#fr_688.md) The demon of
thunder (see Bd. VII, 12).

<span id="fn_681"></span>[133:3](sbe24074.htm#fr_689.md) The lightning (see
Bd. XVII, 1).

<span id="fn_682"></span>[133:4](sbe24074.htm#fr_690.md) The demon of
drought (see Bd. VII, 8, 10, 12, XXVIII, 39). These two conflicts
represent the struggle between rain and drought, which culminates in the
thunderstorm; Tî*s*tar (Sirius) being the bringer of rain.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[133:5](sbe24074.htm#fr_691.md) So in AK, PB3,
MH19, but other MSS. have mâr, 'serpent,' instead of mar, though Nêr.
uses Sans. n*ris*a*m*sa.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[133:6](sbe24074.htm#fr_692.md) Which is manifest
in the world around us.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[135:1](sbe24074.htm#fr_693.md) Nêr. has 'of the
trap' in Sanskrit. The Pâz. dãm, meaning both 'creature' and 'trap.'

<span id="fn_686"></span>[135:2](sbe24074.htm#fr_694.md) Reading bûn
ga*s*tak instead of bûn ya*s*tak, as the word has evidently no reference
to any form of worship. It cannot be translated 'original perversion' (a
possible meaning of the word) because there are two of them (see § 103
and Chap. VIII, 101), one competing with the other (see Chap. VIII, 1),
which, as one of them is here said to be evil, implies that the other is
good and cannot, therefore, be a perversion; nor would this term be
applicable in Chap. VI, 6 or XV, 56.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[135:3](sbe24074.htm#fr_695.md) Or it may be
'primitive,' as kâdmon is the Huzvâri*s* form of the Pâz. khâmast
(superlative of Pers. ‘*h*âm, 'immature') here used.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[135:4](sbe24074.htm#fr_696.md) So in all the
older MSS., but in Sans. it '*is* the long-time lord,' a common Avesta
epithet of 'time,' and this alteration has been introduced into JE, R,
and a few other modern MSS.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[135:5](sbe24074.htm#fr_697.md) Assuming that Pâz.
awâ*z* stands for *e*wâ*z*. The word is omitted by Sans., K28, L15.

<span id="fn_690"></span>[136:1](sbe24074.htm#fr_698.md) As stated in § 72.

<span id="fn_691"></span>[136:2](sbe24074.htm#fr_699.md) Reading adîna*s*,
'then for it,' which is the original Pahlavi indicated by the Pâz. ainâ
of Nêr. (see Mkh. IX, 6 n).

<span id="fn_692"></span>[136:3](sbe24074.htm#fr_700.md) See § 12.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[136:4](sbe24074.htm#fr_701.md) Compare Chap. XII,
79.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[137:1](sbe24074.htm#fr_702.md) Nêr. divides the
word gan*g*ôbar, 'treasurer,' into the three words gan*g* u bar,
'treasure and produce.' These treasurers are the female spirits who meet
the soul after death, with its stores of good works and sins (see Dd.
XXIV, 5, XXV, 5), and symbolize its good and bad conscience, represented
by a beautiful maiden and a frightful hag, respectively.

<span id="fn_695"></span>[137:2](sbe24074.htm#fr_703.md) The accuser is any
person or thing of the good creation that has been injured by any sin,
and who must be satisfied by atonement before the sin can be remitted.
The question, therefore, to be settled, when the account of the soul is
rendered, is whether its good works are sufficient to atone for its
sins. In this case the treasurer of offences represents the accusers.

<span id="fn_696"></span>[137:3](sbe24074.htm#fr_704.md) The treasurer of
good works.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[137:4](sbe24074.htm#fr_705.md) That is, to the
torments of hell.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[137:5](sbe24074.htm#fr_706.md) Either the
treasurer of its good works, or the good works themselves.

<span id="fn_699"></span>[138:1](sbe24074.htm#fr_707.md) Compare Chap. XII,
59.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[138:2](sbe24074.htm#fr_708.md) Assuming that Pâz.
*g*umê is a misreading of Huz. yôm-1.

<span id="fn_701"></span>[138:3](sbe24074.htm#fr_709.md) Compare § 61.

<span id="fn_702"></span>[138:4](sbe24074.htm#fr_710.md) See § 73 n, Chaps.
V, 46-IX, 45.

<span id="fn_703"></span>[138:5](sbe24074.htm#fr_711.md) Chap. V.

<span id="fn_704"></span>[138:6](sbe24074.htm#fr_712.md) Chap. X.

<span id="fn_705"></span>[138:7](sbe24074.htm#fr_713.md) Chap. I, 44.

<span id="fn_706"></span>[138:8](sbe24074.htm#fr_714.md) It is doubtful
whether this dîni-i-khard was the name of a book now unknown, as the
phrase admits of reasonable translation.

<span id="fn_707"></span>[138:9](sbe24074.htm#fr_715.md) This writer is
also mentioned in Chaps. I, 38, IX, 2, X, 52, but his name has not yet
been found elsewhere. As he does not <span id="page_139">p. 139</span>
appear to be mentioned in that portion of the Dînka*rd* known to be
extant, his writings were probably embodied in the first two books of
that work, which have not yet been discovered.

<span id="fn_708"></span>[139:1](sbe24074.htm#fr_716.md) The most extensive
Pahlavi work in existence, of which only Books III-IX are extant; they
contain about 170,000 words and are a summary of the religious opinions,
customs, legends, and literature of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers, compiled
probably in or before the eighth century of the Christian era from
earlier records.

<span id="fn_709"></span>[139:2](sbe24074.htm#fr_717.md) An early editor of
the Dînka*rd*, 'acts of the religion.' His selections from various
religious writings form the fourth and fifth books of that work. He
appears to have been succeeded in the editorship by his son Zaratû*s*t.
And when their manuscript became worn out, it was finally re-edited by
Âtû*r*pâ*d*, son of Hêmî*d*, who lived in the latter part of the ninth
century. All these three editors were 'leaders of the good religion,'
and are mentioned in the last paragraphs of the third book of the
Dînka*rd*.

<span id="fn_710"></span>[139:3](sbe24074.htm#fr_718.md) Pâz. daraa means
rather 'subject' than 'chapter' (Pâz. dar).

<span id="fn_711"></span>[139:4](sbe24074.htm#fr_719.md) See Chap. XVI,
53-107.
