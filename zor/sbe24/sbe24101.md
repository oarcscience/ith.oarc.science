### CHAPTER XIII.

1\. The thirteenth subject is this, that it is necessary to maintain the
souls of fathers, mothers, and relations properly. 2. And, when any day
of theirs <span id="fr_1173"></span>[4](#fn_1164.md) occurs, it is
necessary to make an endeavour, so that they *may* accomplish the
ceremonial (yazi*s*n), the sacred feast (myazd), *the consecration of*
the sacred cakes (drôn), and the benedictions (âfrîngân).

3\. For it is declared in revelation, that, every time that any day of
theirs occurs, they will bring with

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

themselves 9999 guardian spirits of the righteous, like that *case* when
any one goes home himself, and brings people (qaûm) in hospitality. 4.
And, when they utter <span id="fr_1174"></span>[1](#fn_1165.md) *the
consecration of* the sacred cakes and sacred feast and the benedictions,
those people become joyful and utter blessings on that house and master
of the house, and on the house-mistress and any persons who are in that
house.

5\. But if they do not celebrate the sacred feast, *the consecration of*
the sacred cakes, the ceremonial, and the benedictions, *the spirits*
will remain for them *in* that place from dawn as long as the period of
a day, and are maintaining a hope that 'perhaps they *will* have us *in*
remembrance.' 6. Then, if they do not bring them <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[2](#fn_1166.md) *into* remembrance, the souls turn
upwards from that place, go very quickly on high, and will say, 'O
creator Hôrmazd! they do not know that we are such as we are <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[3](#fn_1167.md), *and that* it is necessary for
them <span id="fr_1177"></span>[4](#fn_1168.md) to come into this world,
and in this world they will not give any one acquittal. 7. For them
there is need of the good works in *consecrating* the sacred cakes and
*celebrating* the sacred feast and benedictions; there is no need of
them for such as we. 8. Yet (va lîkin), if they would have maintained a
place *for* <span id="fr_1178"></span>[5](#fn_1169.md) the duty of those
days, we should have turned away from them misfortunes of various kinds;
but, as they have not maintained <span id="fr_1179"></span>[6](#fn_1170.md)
observance of us *in* the day's duty, we are not able to come in
friendship *to* this house.'

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 9. Thus much they
say, and turn *away* in anger, and go away from that place.
