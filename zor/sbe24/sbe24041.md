### CHAPTER XXXV.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: How many are those
people whom it is necessary to consider as rich, and how many are those
who are poor?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'These are the people it is
necessary to consider as rich:—(5) one is he who is perfect in wisdom;
(6) the second, whose body is healthy, and he lives fearlessly; (7) the
third, who is content with that which has come; (8) the fourth, he whose
destiny is a helper in virtue; (9) the fifth, who is well-famed in the
eyes of the sacred beings, and *by* the tongues of the good; (10) the
sixth, whose trust is on this one, pure, good religion of the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers; (11) *and* the seventh, whose wealth is from
honesty.

12\. 'And these are the people to be considered as poor:—(13) one is he
*with* whom there is no wisdom; (14) the second, whose body is not
healthy; (15) the third, who lives in his fear, terror <span

not ruling in his

own body; (17) the fifth, whose destiny is no helper; (18) the sixth,
who is infamous in the eyes of the sacred beings, and *on* the tongues
of the good; (19) *and* the seventh, who is old, *and* no child and
kindred exist.'
