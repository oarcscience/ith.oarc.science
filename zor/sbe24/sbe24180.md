### CHAPTER XCII.

1\. The ninety-second subject is this, that it is necessary to properly
maintain the sacred fire <span id="fr_1560"></span>[4](#fn_1549.md) and
some one who *will* work with assiduity (kandân) to provide <span
id="fr_1561"></span>[5](#fn_1550.md) maintenance and sympathy for it. 2.
And the supply of its firewood is entirely *in* such a manner that they
burn this year the firewood of last year <span
id="fr_1562"></span>[6](#fn_1551.md). 3. *At* midnight they make *it* blaze
up, *and* put incense upon *it in* such a manner that the wind carries
off its scent.

4\. The demons and fiends rush away, because there is the glory of the
sacred fire that we are able to make a living existence in the midst of
this

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

people. 5. For, if no fiend <span id="fr_1563"></span>[1](#fn_1552.md) and
the glory of the archangels and the day of the sacred fire had not
existed, it would not have been possible to produce the living existence
any day. 6. And, therefore, it makes *it* expedient that they supply a
fire-attendant to maintain the firewood and fire, so that a seeking for
*its* safety (’hâfiyat) *may* come into *operation*, and they *may* know
a support and protection for it that would be acceptable.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1549"></span>[355:4](sbe24180.htm#fr_1560.md) Literally 'the
fire of Bahirâm.' Compare Chap. XXXIX.

<span id="fn_1550"></span>[355:5](sbe24180.htm#fr_1561.md) Lp, B29, J15
have 'so that some one *may* keep watch over it, and is to provide
proper.'

<span id="fn_1551"></span>[355:6](sbe24180.htm#fr_1562.md) So that it may
be quite dry, as to put anything damp into a fire would be considered
sinful (see AV. X, 6-24).

<span id="fn_1552"></span>[356:1](sbe24180.htm#fr_1563.md) That is, the
absence of fiends. B29 has 'if the splendour.'
