<p>1. The eighty-first subject is this, that every duty and good work, which it is requisite to perform, they <I>should</I> accomplish while within that day, and not postpone for the morrow.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_345"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 345</FONT></A></p>  
<p>2. For it is declared in revelation, that the creator H&ocirc;rmazd spoke to Zaratu<I>s</I>t thus: 'O Zaratu<I>s</I>t! I have created no one better than thee in the world, and after thee I <I>shall</I> likewise not create <I>one;</I> thou <I>art</I> my chosen one, and I have made this world apparent on account of thee. 3. And all&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1514"></A><A HREF="#fn_1503"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> these people (&#145;<I>h</I>al&acirc;&icirc;q) whom I have created, and the whole of these monarchs who have existed and do exist, have always maintained the hope that I <I>should</I> create thee in their days, so that they <I>should</I> accept (qab&ucirc;l kunand) the religion, and their souls <I>should</I> attain to the supreme heaven.</p>  
<p>4. 'Nevertheless I have created <I>thee</I> at the present time, in the middle period; for it is three thousand years from the days of Gay&ocirc;mard till now, and from now till the resurrection are the three thousand years that remain: therefore, I have created thee in the middle. 5. For whatever is in the middle is more precious and better and more valuable, <I>in</I> the same manner as the heart is in the middle of the whole body <I>and</I> is unquestionably (l&acirc;-<I>g</I>arm) very precious&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1515"></A><A HREF="#fn_1504"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <I>in</I> the same manner as the land of <I>E</I>r&acirc;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1516"></A><A HREF="#fn_1505"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is more valuable than other lands, for the reason that it is in the middle. 6. And the country of <I>E</I>r&acirc;n, which is <I>in</I> the fourth climate (iql&icirc;m)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1517"></A><A HREF="#fn_1506"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, is better than other places, for the reason that it is in the middle. 7. Therefore, I have created thee in the middle, in the manner of <I>what is</I> precious, and I have given thee the apostleship, and have sent <I>thee</I> to a monarch, a friend of knowledge and a friend of religion.</p>  
<p>8. 'Afterwards, I have sent thee, with thus much</p>

<p>preciousness, to the people; and the knowledge of the good works that mankind perform&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1518"></A><A HREF="#fn_1507"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in life, and have not been able to bring to hand without trouble (mi&#145;hnat), I have made clear <I>and</I> plain unto thee; and I have made thee aware of the whole of knowledge. 9. I have taught <I>it</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1519"></A><A HREF="#fn_1508"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> to thee in the Avesta, in a language that no one in the world considers plain <I>and</I> easy; and I have told thee its interpretation (zand) in a language that is more current among mankind, and thou likewise hast more eloquence (fa&#659;&#145;h) therein.</p>  
<p>10. 'While <I>thou hast</I> all this greatness that I have given to thee, O Zaratu<I>s</I>t! I enact a precept for thee, that "every good work which thou art able to do to-day do not postpone for to-morrow, and accomplish with thine own hand the counsel of thine own soul." 11. Do not be proud (<I>gh</I>arrah) on the <I>score</I> that it is still <I>the time of</I> youth, <I>and</I> it is quite possible to do <I>it hereafter</I>, while thou thinkest thus: "I will do <I>it</I> after this." 12. For <I>there</I> have been many people whose <I>remaining</I> life was one day, and they have been taken <I>away</I> in the presence of fifty years&#146; work&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1520"></A><A HREF="#fn_1509"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>13. Therefore, make an effort, so that thou <I>mayest</I> not postpone to-day's duty for to-morrow. 14. Because Aharman, the evil wicked <I>one</I>, has intrusted two fiends with this matter, the name of one is Tardy (d&ecirc;r) and the name of the other is Afterwards (pas). 15. Both these fiends are united, <I>and</I> they</p>

<p>make an effort and exertion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1521"></A><A HREF="#fn_1510"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with man, so that his duty falls back behindhand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1522"></A><A HREF="#fn_1511"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 16. For, <I>as to</I> every duty and good work which comes forward, that fiend whose name is Tardy speaks thus: 'Thou wilt live long, and it is possible to perform this duty <I>at</I> all times;' and that fiend whose name is Afterwards says: 'Pass on now; it is possible to perform <I>it</I> afterwards.' 17. And these two fiends united keep the soul away from its own duty, till the end arrives; all duties have fallen back behindhand, and <I>it has</I> to experience regret (&#145;hasarat) and penitence. 18. It has no benefit through duty <I>and</I> good works, <I>and</I> departs from this world.</p>
