### CHAPTER XL.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'What is the colder
and what is the warmer? 3. What is the brighter and what is the darker?
4. What is the fuller and what is the emptier <span
id="fr_423"></span>[2](#fn_418.md)? 5. What end is the more fruitless <span
id="fr_424"></span>[3](#fn_419.md)? 6. What is that thing of which no
superfluity arises *for* any one? 7. What is that which no one is able
to deprive *one of?* 8. What is that thing which it is not possible to
buy at a price? 9. What is that thing with which every one is
always <span id="fr_425"></span>[4](#fn_420.md) satisfied? 10. What is that
with which no one <span id="fr_426"></span>[5](#fn_421.md) whatever is
satisfied? 11. What is that one wish that Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the lord,
*contemplates* <span id="fr_427"></span>[6](#fn_422.md) as regards men? 12.
What is that one wish that Aharman, the wicked, contemplates as regards
men? 13. What is the end of the worldly *existence* and what is the end
of <span id="fr_428"></span>[7](#fn_423.md) the spiritual *one*?'

14\. The spirit of wisdom answered (15) thus: 'The heart of the
righteous is the warmer, and that

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

of the wicked the colder. 16. Righteousness is the brighter, and
wickedness the darker. 17. The hope *and* protection which *pertain* to
the sacred beings\] <span id="fr_429"></span>[1](#fn_424.md) are the
fuller, and those which pertain to the demons are the emptier <span
id="fr_430"></span>[2](#fn_425.md). 18. The end of the world-arranging
*and* spirit-destroying man is the more fruitless. 19. It is knowledge
of which no one knows a superfluity. 20. It is learning and skill which
no one is able to deprive *one of*. 21. It is understanding and
intellect which it is not possible to buy at a price. 22. It is wisdom
with which every one and one's own self are untroubled and satisfied.
23. It is stupidity and ignorance with which every one and even one's
own self are troubled and not satisfied.

24\. 'That one wish which Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the lord, contemplates as
regards men is this, (25) that "ye shall fully understand me; for every
*one* who fully understands me, comes after me and strives for my
satisfaction." 26. And that one wish which Aharman contemplates as
regards men is this, (27) that "ye shall not understand me;" for he
knows that whoever fully understands that wicked *one*, does not go
after his evil deeds <span id="fr_431"></span>[3](#fn_426), (28.md) and
nothing whatever of power and help for him arises <span
id="fr_432"></span>[4](#fn_427.md) from that man.

29\. 'And *as to* that which is asked by thee concerning the spiritual
and worldly *existences*, the worldly *existence* is, in the end, death
and disappearance, (30) and of the spiritual *existence*, in the end,

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

that of a soul of the righteous is undecaying, immortal, and
undisturbed, full of glory and full of enjoyment, for ever and
everlasting, with the angels and archangels and the guardian
spirits <span id="fr_433"></span>[1](#fn_428.md) of the righteous. 31. And
the bridge <span id="fr_434"></span>[2](#fn_429.md) and destruction <span
id="fr_435"></span>[3](#fn_430.md) and punishment of the wicked in hell are
for ever and everlasting <span id="fr_436"></span>[4](#fn_431.md). 32. And
the wicked soul, apart from the punishment, contemplates the existence,
and even the appearance <span id="fr_437"></span>[5](#fn_432.md), with the
demons and fiends just as, in the worldly *existence*, a healthy man
*does that* with him who is very grievously sick.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_418"></span>[79:2](sbe24046.htm#fr_423.md) Reading tôhiktar,
both here and in § 17; L19 has ta*n*gîtar, as if for tangtar,
'narrower,' in both places.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[79:3](sbe24046.htm#fr_424.md) TD2 has 'fearless,'
but this does not correspond with § 18.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[79:4](sbe24046.htm#fr_425.md) L19 omits 'always.'

<span id="fn_421"></span>[79:5](sbe24046.htm#fr_426.md) L19 has 'nothing.'

<span id="fn_422"></span>[79:6](sbe24046.htm#fr_427.md) The verb in § 12 is
sufficient in Pahlavi for this section also.

<span id="fn_423"></span>[79:7](sbe24046.htm#fr_428.md) L19 omits these
five words.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[80:1](sbe24046.htm#fr_429.md) From this point the
translation again follows the Pahlavi text of K43.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[80:2](sbe24046.htm#fr_430.md) See §4 n.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[80:3](sbe24046.htm#fr_431.md) L19 has 'for
whoever fully understands me *as* wicked, *his* deeds do not go after
me.'

<span id="fn_427"></span>[80:4](sbe24046.htm#fr_432.md) L19 has' nothing
whatever of advantage and help comes to me.'

<span id="fn_428"></span>[81:1](sbe24046.htm#fr_433.md) The guardian
spirits are the spiritual representatives of each individual being and
thing of the good creation, which are supposed to have been all created
by Aûha*r*ma*zd* in the beginning (see Chap. XLIX, 23, Bd. I, 8).

<span id="fn_429"></span>[81:2](sbe24046.htm#fr_434.md) That is the
investigation into the character of the soul at the *K*indvar bridge
(see Chap. II, 115, 162). L19 omits this mention of the bridge.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[81:3](sbe24046.htm#fr_435.md) Reading drû*s*, as
in L19, but this is doubtful.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[81:4](sbe24046.htm#fr_436.md) This phrase can be
used either with reference to time or to eternity. Time which lasts for
ever must end at the resurrection, as in this case (see Chap. II, 193),
because time then ceases to exist. But eternity which lasts for ever can
never end. If this phrase had the same meaning here as in § 30, it would
contradict all the other statements regarding the fate of the wicked,
which are to be found in Pahlavi literature, including those of the
author himself.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[81:5](sbe24046.htm#fr_437.md) L19 has 'the wicked
soul contemplates being apart from the punishment, and also apart from
appearance.'
