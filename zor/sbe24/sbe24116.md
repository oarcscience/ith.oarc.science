### CHAPTER XXVIII.

1\. The twenty-eighth subject is this, that, when they teach the Avesta,
it is *in* like manner necessary

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

that they teach *it* properly and truly, *and* recite *it* with
deliberation and composure (sâkinî). 2. And it is necessary *for* those
who are taught to recite *it* connectedly, and to keep *it* ever *in*
remembrance.

3\. For it is declared in revelation, that the sacred being *has*
decreed thus: '*As to* every one who puts the Avesta away from *his*
memory, I *will* put his soul as far from heaven as the width of the
earth <span id="fr_1254"></span>[1](#fn_1244).' 4. And in the commentary
of the Avesta it is related *that*, in former times, *as to* any one who
had been taught the Avesta and had put *it* away from *his* memory,
until the time he had again made *it* easy, they would have given him
bread like that which they give to the dogs. 5. *And in* another place I
have read that they would have given bread to him *on* the point of a
spear.
