### CHAPTER LX.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Of mankind which are
more conversant with good and evil?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'Of mankind *he* whose
sojourn <span id="fr_576"></span>[3](#fn_568.md) and business are with the
bad <span id="fr_577"></span>[4](#fn_569.md), and they provide him a name
for good repute and goodness, is the man more conversant with good. 5.
And he whose sojourn and business are with the good <span
id="fr_578"></span>[5](#fn_570.md), and they provide him a name for
disrepute, is the man more conversant with evil.

6\. 'Because it is said, (7, 8) that whoever joins with the good brings
good with *him*, and whoever

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

joins with the bad *brings* <span id="fr_579"></span>[1](#fn_571.md)
evil—(9) just like the wind which, when it impinges on stench, is <span
id="fr_580"></span>[2](#fn_572) stench, (10.md) and when it impinges on
perfume, is perfume,—(11) *it* is, therefore, notorious <span
id="fr_581"></span>[3](#fn_573), (12.md) that he whose business is with the
good receives good, (13) and *he* whose business is with the bad
*receives* <span id="fr_582"></span>[4](#fn_574) evil; (14.md) but, even
then, both are to be considered as an experiment (aû*z*mâyi*s*nŏ) <span
id="fr_583"></span>[5](#fn_575.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_568"></span>[106:3](sbe24066.htm#fr_576.md) Reading ni*s*astŏ.
L19 has 'whose business is most (vê*s*-ast),' both here and in § 5.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[106:4](sbe24066.htm#fr_577.md) L19 has 'the
good.'

<span id="fn_570"></span>[106:5](sbe24066.htm#fr_578.md) L19 has 'the bad.'

<span id="fn_571"></span>[107:1](sbe24066.htm#fr_579.md) L19 has 'will
bring with *him*' in both clauses, but the repetition is unnecessary in
Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[107:2](sbe24066.htm#fr_580.md) L19 has 'will
bring with *it*,' both here and in § 10.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[107:3](sbe24066.htm#fr_581.md) L19 has 'proper to
know.'

<span id="fn_574"></span>[107:4](sbe24066.htm#fr_582.md) K43 does not
repeat this verb.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[107:5](sbe24066.htm#fr_583.md) L19 has 'by the
result (a*nz*âme*s*n).' The meaning is that, though a man's character is
generally in accordance with the company he keeps, this must not be
assumed without proof; and when the contrary is the case, as stated in
§§ 4, 5, his own disposition must be of a very decided nature. Nêryôsang
seems to have misunderstood the author's argument, and, supposing §§
6-13 to contain a mere illustration of §§ 4, 5, he considered it
necessary to transpose 'the bad' and 'the good' in §§ 4, 5, so as to
make the illustration applicable.
