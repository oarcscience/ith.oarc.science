### CHAPTER XIII.

1\. Again, about the inconsistency and faulty statements of the first
scripture <span id="fr_916"></span>[3](#fn_908), (2.md) which they call
holy (â*z*â*d*)—(3) and as to it they are, *in* every way, unanimous
that the sacred being wrote *it* with his own hand, *and* gave *it* to
Moses (Mûshâê)—(4) so that, as *it* is full of delusion, I *will* here
publish, for your information, a story <span
id="fr_917"></span>[4](#fn_909.md) out of all *its* stupidity and of much
that is in it.

5\. It states, in the beginning *of* the scripture, (6) that *there*
first arose earth, without form and void <span
id="fr_918"></span>[5](#fn_910.md),

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

darkness, and black water; (7) and the breathing <span
id="fr_919"></span>[1](#fn_911.md) of the sacred being ever yearns <span
id="fr_920"></span>[2](#fn_912.md) over the face of that black water <span
id="fr_921"></span>[3](#fn_913.md). 8. Afterwards the sacred being spoke
thus: 'Let *there* be light,' (9) and *there* was light <span
id="fr_922"></span>[4](#fn_914.md). 10. And stooping he considered that
light below him, (11) and the light *was* transmitted by him to the day,
and the darkness to the night <span id="fr_923"></span>[5](#fn_915.md). 12.
In six days this world and sky *and* earth *were* also created by him,
(13) for during the seventh day he was reposing (khaspân) and
comfortable <span id="fr_924"></span>[6](#fn_916.md). 14. Through that same
mystery (râ*z*) even now the Jews are enjoying repose *on* the Sabbath
day <span id="fr_925"></span>[7](#fn_917.md).

15\. This, too, *is stated*, that Adam and his wife Eve (Havâê) *were*
created by him, (16) *and* put into a garden of paradise (vahi*s*t);
(17) so that Adam

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

should perform cultivation in that garden, and should keep watch <span
id="fr_926"></span>[1](#fn_918.md). 18. The Lord <span
id="fr_927"></span>[2](#fn_919.md), who is the sacred being himself,
commanded Adam (19) thus: 'Eat of every tree which is in this garden,
except of that tree of knowledge; (20) because when you eat thereof you
die <span id="fr_928"></span>[3](#fn_920.md).' 21. Afterwards a serpent
*was* also put by him into the garden; (22) *and* that serpent deceived
Eve *and* spoke thus: '*Let* us eat of the gathering from this tree,
*and let* us give *it* to Adam <span id="fr_929"></span>[4](#fn_921.md).'
23. And she acted accordingly, (24) and Adam likewise ate <span
id="fr_930"></span>[5](#fn_922.md). 25. And *his* knowledge became such
that good *was* distinguished by him from evil, and they did not
die <span id="fr_931"></span>[6](#fn_923.md). 26. He also saw and knew that
he was naked, (27) *and* became concealed under the trees; (28) he
likewise covered over his own body *with* leaves of trees, on account of
the shame of nakedness <span id="fr_932"></span>[7](#fn_924.md). 29.
Afterwards the Lord went to the

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

garden, *and* called Adam by name thus: 'Where art thou <span
id="fr_933"></span>[1](#fn_925.md)?' 30. Adam replied thus: 'Here I am,
under the trees, for this reason, because I am naked <span
id="fr_934"></span>[2](#fn_926).' 31. The Lord indulged *in* wrath, (32.md)
*and* spoke thus: 'Who could have informed *thee* that thou art naked?
33. Mayest thou not ever yet <span id="fr_935"></span>[3](#fn_927.md)
*have* eaten of that tree of knowledge, *of* which I said that you shall
not eat <span id="fr_936"></span>[4](#fn_928.md)?' 34. Adam spoke thus: 'I
have *been* deceived *by* this woman, who *was* given to me by thee, and
I ate <span id="fr_937"></span>[5](#fn_929.md).' 35. And the Lord enquired
of Eve thus: 'Why *was* it so done by thee?' 36. Eve spoke thus: 'I have
*been* deceived *by* this serpent <span
id="fr_938"></span>[6](#fn_930.md).' 37. And Adam and Eve and the serpent
are, all three, forced out of the garden of paradise by him with a
curse <span id="fr_939"></span>[7](#fn_931.md). 38. And he spoke to Adam
thus: 'Thy eating shall be through the scraping off of sweat <span
id="fr_940"></span>[8](#fn_932.md)

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

and the panting of the nostrils, (39) until the end of thy life; (40)
and thy land shall grow all bodily refuse and dung <span
id="fr_941"></span>[1](#fn_933.md).' 41. He also spoke to Eve thus: 'Thy
pregnancy shall be in pain and uneasy, and thy bringing forth in
grievous hastening <span id="fr_942"></span>[2](#fn_934.md).' 42. And he
spoke to the serpent thus: 'Thou shalt be accursed from amid the
quadrupeds and wild animals of the plain and mountain; (43) for thee
also *there* shall be no feet, (44) and thy movement shall be on *thy*
belly, and *thy* food dust. 45. And betwixt thy offspring, with *those
of* the woman, *there* shall be such hatred and conversion to enmity
that they *will* wound the head of that offspring <span
id="fr_943"></span>[3](#fn_935.md).'

46\. This, too, they say, that this worldly *existence*, with whatever
is in everything, was made and produced by him for mankind; (47) and man
*was* made by him predominant over all creatures and creations, wet and
dry <span id="fr_944"></span>[4](#fn_936.md).

48\. Now I *will* tell *you* a story (nisang-1) about

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

the contents of their twaddle and the faultiness of their statements,
(49) that is, where and with what limits did that earth without form and
void <span id="fr_945"></span>[1](#fn_937.md), the darkness, the sacred
being and his breathing <span id="fr_946"></span>[2](#fn_938.md), and the
black water arise? 50. Or *of* what description was the sacred being
himself? 51. *It is* manifest that he was not light, (52) because, when
the light was seen by him, (53) stooping he considered *it* <span
id="fr_947"></span>[3](#fn_939.md), for the reason that he had not seen it
*before*. 54. If they say that he was dark, that manifestly *implies*
that the origin of darkness is uttering <span
id="fr_948"></span>[4](#fn_940.md) a word *and* there is light. 55. If they
say that he was not dark, but light, (56) why, when the light *was* seen
by him, did he admire *and* consider it, though he was light himself?
57. And if they say that he was neither light nor dark, (58) it is
necessary for such to specify that third *state* which is not light and
not dark.

59\. Then *as to* him whose position and abode were in darkness and
black water, and light was never seen by him, how was it possible for
him to look *at* that light? 60. And what *was* his divinity owing to?
61. Because even now *it* is not possible for any one who remains in
darkness to look *at* the light. 62. *Observe* also this, that if his
origin and abode were darkness, how was it possible for him to remain
opposite the light? 63. Because this is known, that *it* is not possible
*for* darkness to remain opposite the light, since *the latter* puts it
aside harmless.

64\. Again, *I ask* this, that is, was that earth, which

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

*was* without form and void, limited or unlimited? 65. If it were
limited, what was there outside of it? 66. If it were unlimited, whither
did that unlimitedness of it go, (67) when, as we see, this earth and
worldly *existence* are not those of the first existence?

68\. *As to* that which the Lord spoke, (69) that is: 'Let *there* be
light,' and it was *so*, (70) it is thereupon appropriate to understand
that the Lord *existed* before the *time* that the light arose; (71)
*and* when he was wishing to make the light, and he gave the command for
it to arise, he then considered mentally *in* what way the light is of
good appearance or evil appearance. 72. And if the light, through its
own nature, reached into the knowledge and consideration of the Lord, it
is evident that the light was existing alike within the knowledge and
mind of the Lord, (73) and alike outside of him. 74. For it is not
possible to know and obtain anything, unless *it be* a manifestation of
an existence. 75. If the light was existing is it <span
id="fr_949"></span>[1](#fn_941.md), on that account, a creation of the
Lord? 76. And if they say that the light was not, through its own
nature, within *his* knowledge, that light *was* demanded by him, who
did not know of what nature *it was*, very unwisely. 77. Or how is it
possible to consider in the mind that which one *has* never even thought
of *or* known?

78\. And *observe* this, too, that that command for the arising of light
*was* given *either* to something or to nothing, (79) because this is
certain, that it is necessary to give a command to a performer of
commands. 80. If *it were* given by him to something existing, which
*was* light, that *implies that* the light

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

itself existed. 81. And if the command *were* given by him, to something
not existing, then how did the something not existing hear the command
of the Lord? 82. Or how did it know that the will of the Lord *was*
thus, that 'I *should* become light?' 83. Because the command of the
Lord is not heard *by what* does not exist, in the same manner as though
*it were* not given by him. 84. Since it is not possible *for* the
non-existent even to think in any way, (85) *it was* that which is
appointed nonexistent, so that it does not exist, but *yet* exists <span
id="fr_950"></span>[1](#fn_942.md), that was really before the sight of the
sage <span id="fr_951"></span>[2](#fn_943.md); by which *it was* known *in*
what manner the Lord is demanding that it *shall* arise <span
id="fr_952"></span>[3](#fn_944.md), *and* in the manner which was demanded
by him it arose.

86\. If they say that the light arose from the word of the Lord, which
*was* spoken by him thus: 'Thou shalt arise,' and it was *so*—(87) that
*being* when the Lord and his belongings (khû*d*îh) were dark, and light
had really never *been* seen by him—*in* what way is it possible *for*
that light to arise from *his* word? 88. Because this is known, that
speaking is the progeny of thinking. 89. If they say that his word
became light, that is very marvellous, because then light is the fruit
of darkness, and the source of darkness is thereby the essence of light;

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

or *else it is* this, that the light was concealed in the darkness.

90\. As I *have* said <span id="fr_953"></span>[1](#fn_945.md), it is
evident that it is of no use to give a command, except *to* a performer
of commands, (91) so that it should be *that* the light existed, *and*
then the command was expedient *and* given.

92\. Again, *I ask* this, *as to* these creatures and creations, sky
*and* earth of his, since *they were* prepared and produced by him in
six days, (93) *and* the seventh he reposed (khaspî*d*) therefrom <span
id="fr_954"></span>[2](#fn_946), (94.md) then, when this world *was* not
produced by him from anything, but merely arose by his command, 'thou
shalt arise,' and it was *so*, (95) to what *was* that delay of his of
six days owing? 96. For when his trouble is merely as much as to say
'thou shalt arise,' the existence of that delay of six days is very
ill-seeming. 97. It is also not suitable for trouble to arise for him
therefrom. 98. If it be possible to make the non-existent exist, and *he
be* capable *of it*, it is possible to produce *it* even a long time
back. 99. And if *he be* incapable of producing except in the period of
a day, it is not fitting to speak of his producing it from nothing.

100\. And, again, *I ask* this, that is, when the number of the days
should be known from the sun, whence then is the number of the day,
besides the names of the days, known before the creation of the sun?
101. For they say that the sun *was* produced by him *on* the fourth
day, which is itself Wednesday <span id="fr_955"></span>[3](#fn_947.md).

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

102\. *I* also *ask* this, to what *was it* owing that it was necessary
for him to make *himself* comfortable *and* reposing *on* the seventh
day? 103. When the delay and trouble in his creation and production of
the world was *merely* so much as *that* he spoke thus: 'Thou shalt
arise,' (104) how are those days accounted *for* by him, so that it was
necessary to make him reposing whose trouble is recounted? 105. For if
'thou shalt arise' *were* spoken by him at once, that is his trouble,
and he ought to become comfortable immediately.

106\. Again *I ask* this, that is, for what purpose and cause is Adam
produced by him, *together* with Eve <span
id="fr_956"></span>[1](#fn_948), (107.md) so that while they practise his
will <span id="fr_957"></span>[2](#fn_949.md), the purpose of it is not so
presented by him that they shall not turn *away* from the performance of
his desire? 108. For when it is known by him, before the fact, that they
*will* not be listening *to* his command, and *yet they* are finally
produced by him, that *shows that* for him now to become exhausted, and
to indulge in wrath about them, is unreasonable, (109) because *it* is
evident that the Lord himself was not fully proceeding *with that* which
is desirable for his own will, and is manifestly an opponent and
adversary to his own will. 110. If they are not understood by him before
the fact, and it is not even known by him that they *will* not listen
*to* his command, then he is ignorant and badly informed. 111. If they
say that his will itself was for non-performance, why then is the
command for performance given by him? 112. Also what is the sin in not
performing

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

it, and how goes (113) a horse whom they yoke with *another* in
confinement (lag) and hurry on with a whip (tâ*z*ânak) <span
id="fr_958"></span>[1](#fn_950.md). 114. From this statement signs and
tokens of deceivers are manifested, (115) whose will and command are
inconsistent *and* unadapted, one to the other.

116\. And if his will and desire were this, that they *shall* not turn
*away* from his will, (117) still their power and desire for turning
*away* from his will are much stronger and more resistant than those
which he *gave* for not turning. 118. If the will for their turning
*away* from his will, and also the knowledge of it, were his, and the
command for not turning *away were* given by him, how was it still
possible *for* the distressed Adam *to act* so that they *should* not
turn *away?* 119. Also, the origin and maintenance of his will ought not
to exist, (120) because by turning *away* from his command *one* merely
falsifies (drû*g*e*d*) it as a command, *while* by not turning *away* it
becomes a falsification of both *his* will and knowledge.

121\. Again, *I ask* this, that is, on what account and for what
advantage *was* that garden, prepared by him, produced <span
id="fr_959"></span>[2](#fn_951.md)? 122. And *as to* the tree of knowledge
itself, about which he commanded thus: 'Ye shall not eat *of it*,' and
also *as to* the injunction for not eating *of it*, which *was* issued
by him, why was it necessary for him to make them?

123\. *It* is also evident, from his injunction and

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

command, that scanty knowledge and ignorance are more loved by him,
(124) and *his* desire for them is more than *for* knowledge and wisdom.
125. And *that* even his advantage from ignorance was more, (126)
because while the tree of knowledge was not tasted by them they were
ignorant, and not disobedient and without benefit unto him, (127) *but*
just as their knowledge arose they became disobedient unto him. 128.
*There* was also no anxiety for him from their ignorance, *but* just as
their knowledge arose (129) he became exhausted and wrathful about them,
(130) and, forced out of paradise by him, with grievous discomfort and
disgrace, they are cast <span id="fr_960"></span>[1](#fn_952.md) to the
earth. (131) The sum total is this, that the cause of this birth of
man's knowledge, in the worldly *existence*, was owing to the serpent
and deceit.

132\. They also say this, that things of every kind *were* created for
mankind—on account of which *it* is evident that even that tree *was*
created by him for mankind—(133) and man *was* made by him predominant
over every creature and creation <span id="fr_961"></span>[2](#fn_953.md).
134. If that be so, why *were they* now to incline *their* desires
*away* from that tree which was their own?

135\. From this *following* statement this, too, is evident, that
knowledge was not really originating with him, (136) because if he came
forth to the garden <span id="fr_962"></span>[3](#fn_954.md) and raised his
voice, and called Adam by name thus: 'Where art thou,' *it* is just as
though he were unaware of the place where he existed; (137) *and* if he
had been unanswered by him, *he would have* been unaware of the place
where Adam existed. 138. If it were not owing to his (a*g*a*s*)

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

outcry, too, before seeing *him, he would have* been unaware that he
*had* eaten of that tree, or not; *and of* this also, that is, *by* whom
and how *it was done*, who ate and who deceived. 139. If he were aware,
why *had he* to make that enquiry of him, 'mayest thou not ever yet
*have* eaten of that tree, *of* which I commanded that you shall not
eat <span id="fr_963"></span>[1](#fn_955.md)?' 140. And at first, when he
came forth, he was not exhausted, *but* afterwards, when he knew that
*they had* eaten, he became exhausted about them and was wrathful.

141\. His scanty knowledge is also *evident* from this, when he created
the serpent, which *was* itself his adversary, and put *it* into the
garden with them <span id="fr_964"></span>[2](#fn_956); (142.md) or *else*
why *was* not the garden made so fortified by him, that the serpent, and
also other enemies, should thereby not go into it?

143\. Even his falsity is also evident from this, when he spoke thus:
'When you eat of this tree you die <span
id="fr_965"></span>[3](#fn_957.md);' and they *have* eaten and are not
dead, but have become really intelligent, (144) and good is well
recognised from evil by them.

145\. *I* also *ask* this, that is, how is his knowledge inconsistent
*and* competing with *his* will and command? 146. For if *it were*
willed by him to eat of that tree, and the command for not eating *were*
given by him, the knowledge about it was that *the fruit would be*
eaten. 147. Now *it* is evident that the will, knowledge, and command
are all three inconsistent, one towards the other.

148\. This, too, *is evident*, that, though Adam committed sin, the
curse which *was* inflicted by Him (the Lord) <span
id="fr_966"></span>[4](#fn_958.md) reaches unlawfully over people of every
kind

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

at various periods, (149) *and* I consider *it*, in every way, a
senseless, ignorant, and foolish statement.

150\. On this subject, on account of tediousness, thus much is
considered complete.
