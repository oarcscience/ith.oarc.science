<p>I. The tenth subject is this, that it is incumbent on all those of the good religion, women and men, every one who attains to fifteen years, to wear the <I>sacred thread-</I>girdle&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1149"></A><A HREF="#fn_1140"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. 2. Because the <I>sacred thread-</I>girdle is to be a girding of the loins and to preserve obedience (<I>t</I>&acirc;&#146;hat) to the Lord, may he be honoured and glorified (&#146;hazza va <I>g</I>alla)!</p>  
<p>3. The first person who set the wearing of this <I>sacred thread-</I>girdle in view was Jamsh&ecirc;<I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1150"></A><A HREF="#fn_1141"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. 4. And it may be the whole (<I>g</I>umlah) of the demons and fiends who are made extinct by the glory of wearing the <I>sacred thread-</I>girdle.</p>  
<p>5. Every one who <I>has</I> tied the <I>sacred thread-</I>girdle round the waist is out of the department of Aharman, and is established in the department of</p>

And also, while he keeps the <I>sacred thread-</I>girdle on the waist, <I>there</I> is a share <I>for</I> him of all those duties and good works which they perform in the earth of seven regions. 7. It is like that <I>which occurs</I> when they are performing ham&acirc; z&ocirc;r and ham&acirc; ash&ocirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1151"></A><A HREF="#fn_1142"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and have put <I>on</I> this <I>sacred thread-</I>girdle on that account, <I>or</I> when, similarly, some one in Ka<I>s</I>m&icirc;r, or <I>E</I>r&acirc;n-ve<I>g</I>, or Kangdez, or the enclosure formed by Jam&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1152"></A><A HREF="#fn_1143"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, performs a good work, <I>and</I> we are not able to perform <I>it</I> with ham&acirc; z&ocirc;r, then they and we, <I>who</I> wear the <I>sacred thread-</I>girdle on the waist, are mutually connected and equally meritorious, one <I>with</I> the other. 8. As no good work attains to him <I>who</I> does not wear a <I>sacred thread-</I>girdle&#151;excepting that which he performs himself&#151;it is therefore necessary that any one of mankind <I>should</I> not put <I>it</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1153"></A><A HREF="#fn_1144"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> away from the waist on any occasion, so that the associated good works of those of the good religion <I>may</I> attain to him.</p>  
<p>9. And those four knots&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1154"></A><A HREF="#fn_1145"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, <I>with</I> which they tie <I>it</I> on, are on this account, that it <I>may</I> give four attestations.</p>  
<p>

<p>

<p><A NAME="page_270"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 270</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> 10. The first knot is that which preserves&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1155"></A><A HREF="#fn_1146"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> constancy (qar&acirc;r), and gives attestation as to the existence, unity, purity, and matchlessness of the sacred being, the good <I>and</I> propitious. 11. The second knot is that which gives attestation <I>that it is</I> the good religion of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers which is the word of the sacred being. 12. The third knot is that which gives attestation as to the apostleship and mission (ras&ucirc;l&icirc;) in the just (&#145;haqq) Zaratu<I>s</I>t, the Spitam&acirc;n. 13. The fourth knot is that which adduces more pleasantly, gives assurance (iqr&acirc;r), and openly accepts that I <I>should</I> think of good, speak of good, and do good. 14. And from the whole I become established; and the pure, good&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1156"></A><A HREF="#fn_1147"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> religion is this, that I persist in those <I>views</I>.</p>  
<p>15. And, again, when the archangels came meeting Zaratu<I>s</I>t they likewise wore the <I>sacred thread-</I>girdle on the waist; and the distinctive <I>characteristic</I> (farq) amid the laws of the sacred being is the wearing of the <I>sacred thread-</I>girdle. 16. It is incumbent both on woman and on man, <I>and</I> it is altogether (albattah) improper when they do not wear <I>it</I>.</p>

If this good work be in excess of what is wanted to balance its performer's sins, it can be imputed to any other member of the good religion who may be in want of it, provided he wears the girdle.
