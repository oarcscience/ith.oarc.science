### CHAPTER V.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Which land is the
happier <span id="fr_170"></span>[5](#fn_168.md)?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'That: land is the happier,
in which a righteous man, who is true-speaking, makes his abode. 5. The
second,

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

in which they make the abode of fires. 6. The third, when oxen and sheep
repose upon it. 7. The fourth is uncultivated and uninhabited land when
they bring *it* back to cultivation and habitableness. 8. The fifth,
from which they extirpate the burrows of noxious creatures. 9. The
sixth, on which exist the ceremonies and coming of the sacred beings,
and the sitting of the good <span id="fr_171"></span>[1](#fn_169.md), 10.
The seventh, when they make populous that which *was* desolate. 11. The
eighth, when from the possession of the bad it comes into the possession
of the good. 12. The ninth, when of the produce and yield (bê*d*ŏ) which
arise from it they provide the share of the sacred beings, the good, and
the worthy. 13. *And* the tenth, in which they provide holy-water and
ceremonies.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_168"></span>[27:5](sbe24011.htm#fr_170.md) This chapter is an
imitation of Vend. III, 1-20, where it is stated that the five most
pleasing spots on the earth are, first, where a righteous man performs
ceremonies; second, where he has built his house and keeps his fire,
cattle, family, and retainers; third, where the land is best cultivated;
fourth, where most oxen and sheep are produced; and fifth, that which is
most manured by oxen and sheep.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[28:1](sbe24011.htm#fr_171.md) That is, the
ceremonial precinct where the priests sit to conduct the ceremonies.
