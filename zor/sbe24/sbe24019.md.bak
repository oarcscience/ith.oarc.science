### CHAPTER XIII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Wherefore is *it*
when oxen and sheep, birds, flying creatures, and fish are, each one,
properly learned in that which is their own knowledge, (3) and men, so
long as 'they bring no instruction unto them, and they do not perform
much toil and trouble (an*g*înŏ) <span id="fr_218"></span>[1](#fn_215.md)
about it, are not able to obtain and know the learning of the human
race?'

4\. The spirit of wisdom answered (5) thus: 'Men have been so wise, in
the original creation, that, *as to* the good works and crime which
*were* performed by them, the recompense of the good works and the
punishment of the crime *were* then seen by them with their own eyes,
(6) and no crime whatever proceeded from men. 7. *But*, afterwards,
Aharman, the wicked, concealed the recompense of good works and the
punishment of sin. 8. And on this account, moreover, it is said in
revelation (9) that: "\[These\] <span id="fr_219"></span>[2](#fn_216.md)
four \[things are worse and more grievous\] than every evil which the
accursed evil *one*, the wicked, committed upon the creatures of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, (To) \[that is, when the reward of good works and\]
punishment \[of sin\], the thoughts of men, and the consequence of
actions *were* quite concealed \[by him\] <span
id="fr_220"></span>[3](#fn_217.md)."

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

11\. 'And, for the same reason, he made many devotions and improper
creeds current in the world. 12. And, on account of men's not knowing of
duty and good works, every one believes that most, and considers *it* as
good, which his teaching in devotion has included. 13. And that
devotion, in particular, is more powerful <span
id="fr_221"></span>[1](#fn_218.md), with which sovereignty exists. 14. But
that one is the lordship and sovereignty of Vi*s*tâsp <span
id="fr_222"></span>[2](#fn_219), the king of kings, (15.md) by whom, on
account of knowing *it* unquestionably and certainly (aêvarîhâ), the
perfect and true religion, which is in the word of the creator
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, was received from the unique Zaratû*s*t, the
Spîtamân <span id="fr_223"></span>[3](#fn_220), (16.md) who has manifested
clearly, explicitly, and unquestionably the treasure of the worldly and
spiritual *existences*, of every kind, from the good religion of the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers. 17. There is then <span
id="fr_224"></span>[4](#fn_221.md) no *other* creed, through which it is
possible for one to obtain and know the treasure of the worldly and
spiritual *existences* so explicitly and clearly, (18) but, on account
of much controversy <span id="fr_225"></span>[5](#fn_222.md), they are so
cut up (âgî*s*takŏ)

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

and entangled, that the statements of their beginning are much unlike to
the middle, and the middle to the end.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_215"></span>[39:1](sbe24019.htm#fr_218.md) Nêr. has read
khva*z*înak, and taken it as equivalent to Pers. khazînah, 'treasury,'
in the sense of 'expenditure;' but this is very doubtful.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[39:2](sbe24019.htm#fr_219.md) The words in
brackets, in §§ 9, 10, are taken from the Pâzand version, as the passage
containing them has been omitted by mistake in K43.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[39:3](sbe24019.htm#fr_220.md) The Pandnâmah of
Buzurg-Mihir states 'this, too, is declared, that the evil spirit
committed even this very grievous thing upon <span id="page_40">p.
40</span>the creatures of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, when the reward of good works
and punishment of sin *were* quite concealed by him, in the thoughts of
men, as the consequence of actions.'

<span id="fn_218"></span>[40:1](sbe24019.htm#fr_221.md) Nêr. has 'purer,'
by connecting pa*d*îyâvandtar with pâ*d*îyâ*v*, 'ablution;' but this is
hardly possible, whereas the former word can be readily traced to Av.
paiti + yâ + va*n*t, with the meaning 'resistant, stubborn, strong;'
compare Pers. payâb, 'power.'

<span id="fn_219"></span>[40:2](sbe24019.htm#fr_222.md) Av. Vî*s*tâspa,
Pers. Gu*s*tâsp, the fifth king of the Kayân dynasty, who adopted the
religion of Zarâtu*s*t in the thirtieth year of his reign, and is said
to have reigned 120 years (see Bd. XXXIV, 7).

<span id="fn_220"></span>[40:3](sbe24019.htm#fr_223.md) See Chap. I, 10 n.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[40:4](sbe24019.htm#fr_224.md) Instead of 'then
for one,' Nêr. has 'otherwise,' as in Chap. IX, 6.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[40:5](sbe24019.htm#fr_225.md) Reading vigûftakîh.
Nor. has 'by much contemplation,' <span id="page_41">p. 41</span>having
read vênaftakîh. Both words are very uncommon, and it is doubtful which
of them is the more appropriate to the context.
