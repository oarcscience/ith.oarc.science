### CHAPTER XXXIX.

1\. The thirty-ninth subject is this, that it is necessary to properly
maintain the sacred fire <span id="fr_1301"></span>[1](#fn_1291.md) which
they have established in a town or village. 2. And *at* night it is
necessary to make *it* blaze up once, and by day twice.

3\. For it is declared in revelation, that, if *there* had been no
sacred fire, no one would have been able to go from town to town;
because it is *owing to* the glory of the sacred fire that no one on the
roads is able to commit an excess upon any one *else*.

4\. It is necessary that they *should* present the whole of the
firewood; and, *as to* the person who makes *it* blaze, they *should*
give him bread and a salary (nafaqah). 5. For, every time that that fire
is satisfied, and they maintain *it* properly, every fire that may exist
in the earth of seven regions becomes satisfied with that person.
