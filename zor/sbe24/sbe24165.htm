<p>1. The seventy-seventh subject is this, that, when a woman's infant is still-born, it is necessary to give <I>her</I> first something washed with ceremony <I>and</I> brought <I>with</I> fire-ashes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1489"></A><A HREF="#fn_1478"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, so that it <I>may</I> make the heart within her pure. 2. After that, <I>for</I> three days, it is altogether improper to give <I>her</I> water, <I>or</I> anything in which <I>there</I> is water or salt. 3. And these three days are from period to period&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1490"></A><A HREF="#fn_1479"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, <I>in</I> such a</p>

<p>manner that, if the duty of mid-day&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1491"></A><A HREF="#fn_1480"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> prayer has occurred, they extend till the mid-day prayer itself, <I>and she is</I> to pass over one other hour <I>and</I> it is <I>then</I> proper to swallow water. 4. After that, till the lapse of forty days, <I>she is</I> to sit apart again, and, afterwards, to undergo the Bareshn&ucirc;m <I>ceremony</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1492"></A><A HREF="#fn_1481"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>5. <I>On</I> the infant's becoming a four-months&#146; <I>child</I>, whenever it is <I>still-</I>born it is a dead <I>body</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1493"></A><A HREF="#fn_1482"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, for the reason that so long as it does not reach the fourth month life does not come to it. 6. And if after three months this affair occurs, <I>one is</I> to exercise great caution (i&#145;htiy&acirc;<I>t</I>) and to insist strictly on this matter.</p>  
<p>7. For our religion has reiterated on this matter that, if <I>one</I> be polluted and do not keep himself pure, so long as he is living he never becomes clean from that pollution. 8. That, if he wash <I>his</I> head ten thousand times in <I>ceremonial</I> ablution, he certainly does not any <I>way</I> become pure from it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1494"></A><A HREF="#fn_1483"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. 9. Because this pollution is not from without; it is from within every bone and vein and tendon; <I>and</I> water makes clean <I>only</I> anything that is on the skin. 10. Impurity which is <I>in</I> the bones, except <I>through the liquid consecrated by</I> the religious formula&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1495"></A><A HREF="#fn_1484"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, does not otherwise become clean.</p>
