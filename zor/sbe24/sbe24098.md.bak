### CHAPTER X.

I. The tenth subject is this, that it is incumbent on all those of the
good religion, women and men, every one who attains to fifteen years, to
wear the *sacred thread-*girdle <span id="fr_1149"></span>[4](#fn_1140.md).
2. Because the *sacred thread-*girdle is to be a girding of the loins
and to preserve obedience (*t*â’hat) to the Lord, may he be honoured and
glorified (’hazza va *g*alla)!

3\. The first person who set the wearing of this *sacred thread-*girdle
in view was Jamshê*d* <span id="fr_1150"></span>[5](#fn_1141.md). 4. And it
may be the whole (*g*umlah) of the demons and fiends who are made
extinct by the glory of wearing the *sacred thread-*girdle.

5\. Every one who *has* tied the *sacred thread-*girdle round the waist
is out of the department of Aharman, and is established in the
department of

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hôrmazd. 6. And
also, while he keeps the *sacred thread-*girdle on the waist, *there* is
a share *for* him of all those duties and good works which they perform
in the earth of seven regions. 7. It is like that *which occurs* when
they are performing hamâ zôr and hamâ ashô <span
id="fr_1151"></span>[1](#fn_1142.md), and have put *on* this *sacred
thread-*girdle on that account, *or* when, similarly, some one in
Ka*s*mîr, or *E*rân-ve*g*, or Kangdez, or the enclosure formed by
Jam <span id="fr_1152"></span>[2](#fn_1143.md), performs a good work, *and*
we are not able to perform *it* with hamâ zôr, then they and we, *who*
wear the *sacred thread-*girdle on the waist, are mutually connected and
equally meritorious, one *with* the other. 8. As no good work attains to
him *who* does not wear a *sacred thread-*girdle—excepting that which he
performs himself—it is therefore necessary that any one of mankind
*should* not put *it* <span id="fr_1153"></span>[3](#fn_1144.md) away from
the waist on any occasion, so that the associated good works of those of
the good religion *may* attain to him.

9\. And those four knots <span id="fr_1154"></span>[4](#fn_1145.md), *with*
which they tie *it* on, are on this account, that it *may* give four
attestations.

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 10. The first knot
is that which preserves <span id="fr_1155"></span>[1](#fn_1146.md)
constancy (qarâr), and gives attestation as to the existence, unity,
purity, and matchlessness of the sacred being, the good *and*
propitious. 11. The second knot is that which gives attestation *that it
is* the good religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers which is the word of
the sacred being. 12. The third knot is that which gives attestation as
to the apostleship and mission (rasûlî) in the just (‘haqq) Zaratu*s*t,
the Spitamân. 13. The fourth knot is that which adduces more pleasantly,
gives assurance (iqrâr), and openly accepts that I *should* think of
good, speak of good, and do good. 14. And from the whole I become
established; and the pure, good <span id="fr_1156"></span>[2](#fn_1147.md)
religion is this, that I persist in those *views*.

15\. And, again, when the archangels came meeting Zaratu*s*t they
likewise wore the *sacred thread-*girdle on the waist; and the
distinctive *characteristic* (farq) amid the laws of the sacred being is
the wearing of the *sacred thread-*girdle. 16. It is incumbent both on
woman and on man, *and* it is altogether (albattah) improper when they
do not wear *it*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1140"></span>[268:4](sbe24098.htm#fr_1149.md) See Dd. XXXIX, 1
n. A modification of the age is recommended in Chap. XLVI.

<span id="fn_1141"></span>[268:5](sbe24098.htm#fr_1150.md) Av. Yima
khshaêta (see Mkh. XXVII, 24 n).

<span id="fn_1142"></span>[269:1](sbe24098.htm#fr_1151.md) These words form
part of a benedictory formula which concludes certain ceremonies (see
Haug's Essays, pp. 407, 409), and the recital of them implies that the
ceremony, which is a good work, has been fully and satisfactorily
completed. If this good work be in excess of what is wanted to balance
its performer's sins, it can be imputed to any other member of the good
religion who may be in want of it, provided he wears the girdle. The
MSS. have hamâ for hamâ.

<span id="fn_1143"></span>[269:2](sbe24098.htm#fr_1152.md) These four
localities are considered to be isolated from the seven regions to some
extent (see Bd. XXIX, 4), probably implying that they were supposed to
contain Ma*zd*a-worshippers independent of Iranian rule, or that their
position had become unknown. (See also Mkh. XXVII, 27-31, 58, 62, XLIV,
17-35, LXII, 13-19.)

<span id="fn_1144"></span>[269:3](sbe24098.htm#fr_1153.md) Lp, B29 have
'that mankind *should* not put the girdle.'

<span id="fn_1145"></span>[269:4](sbe24098.htm#fr_1154.md) That is, two
double knots, one before and the other behind (see SBE, vol. xviii, pp.
386, 387).

<span id="fn_1146"></span>[270:1](sbe24098.htm#fr_1155.md) Altered into
'brings' by a later hand in La, and so written in Lp, B29.

<span id="fn_1147"></span>[270:2](sbe24098.htm#fr_1156.md) Lp, B29 omit
'good.'
