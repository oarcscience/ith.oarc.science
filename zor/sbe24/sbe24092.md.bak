### CHAPTER IV.

1\. The fourth subject is this, that it is not desirable for any one
that he *should* become hopeless of the pity (ra‘hmat) and forgiveness
of Hôrmazd, and fix *his* heart outwardly <span
id="fr_1102"></span>[6](#fn_1094.md) on this, that our sin is excessive
*and it is* not possible to arrive in heaven. 2. Because it happens that
a small quantity of duty *and* good work is performed, *and* it may be
that for that

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

quantity Hôrmazd, the good *and* propitious, *may* have pity on him *and
may* make *him* arrive in heaven.

3\. For it is declared in revelation <span
id="fr_1103"></span>[1](#fn_1095.md), that one time when Zaratu*s*t was in
conversation *with* the sacred being, the most high, he saw a man whose
whole <span id="fr_1104"></span>[2](#fn_1096.md) body was in hell, and one
foot—the right *one* <span id="fr_1105"></span>[3](#fn_1097.md)—was outside
of hell. 4. Zaratu*s*t enquired of the sacred being, the most high <span
id="fr_1106"></span>[4](#fn_1098.md), thus: 'What person has this man
been?' 5. Hôrmazd, the good *and* propitious, gave a reply (*g*avâb)
thus: 'He has been a king, and possessed the sovereignty of thirty-three
towns, and was conducting that sovereignty many years. 6. And he never
did any virtuous action, but was committing much oppression,
lawlessness, and violence (*th*ulṁ) . 7. By chance (qaʓ̣ârâ) he was one
day going on the chase, *and* arrived out at a place (maûʓ̣a’h) *and* saw
a goat *that* was tied. 8. A morsel of hay *was* placed very far *off*,
and that goat was hungry. 9. Owing to this the goat was trying to eat
the hay, but did not reach the hay. 10. This the king saw, *and* kicked
*his* foot at that hay *and* cast *it* in front of the goat. 11. Now, in
recompense for that, that one foot of his is outside of hell, and the
remaining (bâqî) limbs <span id="fr_1107"></span>[5](#fn_1099.md) are in
hell.'

12\. Therefore, although a sin has happened to any one, it is not
necessary *for him* <span id="fr_1108"></span>[6](#fn_1100.md) to become
hopeless. 13. And whoever has the power (*t*âqat)

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

is to endeavour to perform good works, so that *there* may be an
atonement for the sin thereby; because the sacred being, the good *and*
propitious, is kind to every one.
