### CHAPTER V.

1\. Another subject, among the assertors of the non-existence of a
sacred being, is about the existence of the sacred being and his
competitor.

2\. Of the knowledge approvable by wisdom and the statements of the
limits of evidence, *about* the existence of the sacred being and his
competitor, (3)

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

this is a summary:—*One* knows it should be enjoined, that the supreme
first knowledge, most *suitable* for the well-discerning, is
comprehending the sacred being. 4. He, of whom this knowledge is not the
leader of knowledge, is unaided by other knowledge. 5. Comprehending the
sacred being is possible through undecayed <span
id="fr_720"></span>[1](#fn_712.md) understanding, fervent intellect, and
decisive wisdom.

6\. Since comprehending the sacred being is not, thus far, more than
*that one* knows that a sacred being exists, (7) because whoever is
acquainted with the existence of a certain thing, and is unaware of its
nature, is thinking thus, that that thing is good or bad, erudite or
ignorant, antidote or poison, cold *and* frozen or hot and scorching,
dry *and* withering or damp, (8) and, when unaware of its nature, his
only knowledge of it is then useless—(9) for it is possible to cause the
commendation and condemnation of any person *or* thing, not through
*its* existence but through *its* nature—(10) *therefore one* knows this
should be also enjoined, that a knowledge of <span
id="fr_721"></span>[2](#fn_713.md) anything is *acquired* in three
modes:—(11) by knowing *what* is inevitable, or by knowing *what* is
analogous, or by *what* is possible *and* fit to exist.

12\. Inevitable knowledge is such as once one is one, and twice two are
four. 13. For within the bounds of the really inevitable it is not
possible to say, (14) that *there* was *or will* be a time, or a place,
where twice two are said *to be* five or three.

15\. Knowledge *by* analogy is that which announces, from anything
manifest, something which is not

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

manifest, (16) and brings, out of anything visible, something invisible,
in the likeness of a hand put up <span id="fr_722"></span>[1](#fn_714.md),
for the household service of the perception of wisdom, (17) through
complete similarity, resemblance, *or* partial resemblance.

18\. Complete similarity is such as *that of* a man of Pârs to a man of
another district. 19. Resemblance is such as *that of* cheese to the
white of an egg. 20. And partial resemblance is such as *that of* cheese
to chalk, (21) since this is about the limit of partial resemblance,
because cheese is like unto chalk only in whiteness, (22) *but to* the
white of an egg in whiteness and also as food.

23\. And there is also *that* which is called more resembling than
resemblance, and more partially resembling *than* partial resemblance.
24. That which is more *than* complete similarity is not spoken about,
(25) because completion does not become more complete.

26\. By this mode *it* is set forth a second time at more length. 27. To
demonstrate an invisible from a visible thing is such as from a thing
made and maintained, which is not domestically serving the maker and
maintainer, (28) and from a thing written, whose writer is not declared,
(29) are manifest a maker of that *which is* made, a maintainer of that
*which is* maintained, *and* a writer of that *which is* written, who
are inevitable, (30) because that which is not manifest *and* is
invisible is demonstrated by the thing which is manifest and visible.

31\. Information of that which is within the possible *and* fit to exist
is credible, (32) such as what *one*

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

states thus: 'I saw a man by whom a lion, or a lion by whom a man, *was*
slain outright.' 33. And this, *being* that which is within the limits
of the possible *and* fit to exist, may be a lie. 34. But when a man
announces that intelligence, who is renowned for truth and tested in
judgment, it is within the limits of truth and reality. 35. If a man
announces *it*, who is disgraced by falsehood and tested in misjudgment,
it is within the limits of falsehood and unreality.

36\. Another mode, outside of these *and* within the limits of the
inevitable, is *by knowing what has* not occurred *and* is not possible;
(37) such as what *one* states thus: 'It is possible to bring the world,
in secrecy, into the inside of an egg,' (38) or 'it is possible *for* an
elephant to pass into an eye of a needle,' (39) *in* such a manner *as*
though one *of them* really becomes no greater and no less, (40) or
*its* substance is something which is not a rudiment.

41\. A struggle which should not be limited, (42) an existing thing
which is not temporary and localised, (43) or is localised *and* not
limited, (44) the working of a vain miracle, (45) and other *things* of
this description of speaking *and* imagining are faulty and false and
not possible.

46\. Then <span id="fr_723"></span>[1](#fn_715.md) the knowledge of the
existence of him who is the exalted sacred being, apart from tangibility
of nature and other evidence, is through the inevitable and analogy,
(47) as much visible before the sight of wisdom as from the
prosperity <span id="fr_724"></span>[2](#fn_716.md), formation, and
organization which are, according to different

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

statements of many kinds, the formation of the things of the world and
mankind whose particles, *and* the appliances which are owing thereto,
are such as the elements of the body *and* life, from which <span
id="fr_725"></span>[1](#fn_717) they are prepared *and* formed, (48.md)
which are fire, water, air, *and* earth, (49) that are, each separately,
a stimulus so qualified and ennobled for their own operations, (50) that
the operation of fire, through its own quality (*k*îharîh) and nobility
(vâspûharakânîh), is such that the operations of water, air, *and* earth
are not to stimulate unrestricted (atang) <span
id="fr_726"></span>[2](#fn_718.md) by it. 51. Thus, also, the operation of
water, through its own quality, is such that the operations of air,
fire, *and* earth are not *unrestricted* by it. 52. So, also, of air,
the operations of fire, water, *and* earth are not *unrestricted by it*.
53. So, also, of earth, the operations of these *others* are to
stimulate not unrestricted *by it*. 54. But each separately is for its
own operation, just as they are ennobled *and* qualified (55) by him who
is, sagaciously *and* methodically, a qualifier, a constructor, and an
ennobler. 56. *And* the organization is constructed, prepared,
qualified, *and* ennobled as is suitable for those operations.

57\. So, also, *as to* mankind and the other creatures, who are the
germinating of these elements, (58) whose organization of bone, fat,
sinew, veins, and skin, each separately (59) without sympathy, one for
the other, is visible altogether. 60. Thus, too, are the nobility *and*
qualification of the internal organs, (61) such as the liver,
heart <span id="fr_727"></span>[3](#fn_719.md), lungs, kidneys,
gall-bladder, *and*

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

other appliances, *for* every one of which a function of its own is
manifest. 62. They are qualified *and* ennobled for their defence by
those functions which are their own.

63\. So, also, is the qualification of the eye, ear, nose, tongue,
mouth, teeth, hand, foot, *and* other external appliances, whose own
functions are each separate. 64. And *it* is visibly manifest therein;
inasmuch as, when one of these organs is disabled, any *one* of the rest
is not suitable for the work of that other *one*, for which it is not
qualified. 65. And when only the construction of one of the organs of
the body is examined into—that is, how *it is*—it is wonderfully
sagaciously constructed <span id="fr_728"></span>[1](#fn_720.md).

66\. Such as the eye, which is of many natures of different names and
different purposes, (67) as the eyelash, the eyelid, the white, the
eyeball (khâyak), the iris (sâyak), *and* the pupil (tê*d*ak), (68) *in*
such way that the white is fat <span id="fr_729"></span>[2](#fn_721.md),
(69) the iris is water which *has* so stood in the prison <span
id="fr_730"></span>[3](#fn_722.md) of fat that the turning of the eye, from
side to side, occurs through it, (70) *and* the pupil, itself the sight,
is like a view into the water. 71. The iris stands in the prison of
white, like the standing of water in a prison of fat; (72) and the pupil
is within the iris, like the view of a thing within clear water, (73)
*or* the form of a column in

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

a shining mirror. 74. And the arrangement of the white *in* the orbit is
for the reason that the dust whirling from the atmosphere, when it
arrives at the eye, shall not be concealed in it, (75) *but* shall turn
to the lid (gumb) of the eye, (76) and shall not injure the sight of the
eye. 77. Just as the construction of the tube (rag) of the ear is
undilated (afâhal), for the reason (78) that whirls of dust and winged
noxious creatures shall not rightly enter therein. 79. And the moisture
of oneself, the secretion of the ear, and the venom of noxious creatures
are manifestly as *useful* <span id="fr_731"></span>[1](#fn_723.md).

80\. When the appliances of life and soul are observed—(81) such as the
smell, hearing; sight, taste, and touch which are causing the
intelligence of living beings, (82) as also the wisdom of every pontiff
(ra*d*), *which* is pronounced decisive, (83) the knowledge which is
acquiring, (84) the intellect which is a seeker *and* transmitter, (85)
the understanding which is a treasurer *and* defender, (86) the
consciousness which is itself the sight of the soul, (87) the guardian
spirit (fravash) which is itself the nature that is a maintainer of the
body, (88) the spiritual life (ahû) which is pure, (89) and the other
spiritual *existences* that are maintaining the body, which are each
separately qualified, in that manner <span
id="fr_732"></span>[2](#fn_724), *for* their operation and duty—(90.md)
they are perfect in their own operation, as to duty such as they are
ennobled *and* qualified *for*. 91. As to that *for* which they are not
qualified, they are not suitable.

92\. The two *arguments* which are each separate

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

in the Dînka*rd* manuscript, as the supremely learned *one* <span
id="fr_733"></span>[1](#fn_725.md) *has* explained *them* out of *his*
knowledge of the religion, are here set forth at length. 93. *He* whose
wish is to fully understand the wonderfulness of the Ma*zd*a-worshipping
religion and the statements of the primitive faith, (94) examines into
it in a manuscript of that character, (95) *and* shall understand more
fully the wonderfulness and truth of the religion <span
id="fr_734"></span>[2](#fn_726.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_712"></span>[140:1](sbe24075.htm#fr_720.md) Assuming that Pâz.
agunast (Sans. anâvila) stands for Pahl. agôndî*d*; but it may stand for
Pahl. agûngî*d*, 'unsilenced.'

<span id="fn_713"></span>[140:2](sbe24075.htm#fr_721.md) Sans. inserts 'the
nature of.'

<span id="fn_714"></span>[141:1](sbe24075.htm#fr_722.md) As a finger-post.

<span id="fn_715"></span>[142:1](sbe24075.htm#fr_723.md) Reading adîna*s*,
'then of him,' for Pâz. ainâ, as in Chap. IV, 81. Having explained the
modes of arguing, in §§ 12-45, the author now returns to the argument
itself.

<span id="fn_716"></span>[142:2](sbe24075.htm#fr_724.md) So in Sans., but
bâhar-hômandîh also means 'divisibility.'

<span id="fn_717"></span>[143:1](sbe24075.htm#fr_725.md) Reading mûn
a*z*a*s* for Pâz. ke va*s*.

<span id="fn_718"></span>[143:2](sbe24075.htm#fr_726.md) See Chap. III, 30
n.

<span id="fn_719"></span>[143:3](sbe24075.htm#fr_727.md) Assuming that Pâz.
dawur is a misreading of Pahl. dîl.

<span id="fn_720"></span>[144:1](sbe24075.htm#fr_728.md) So in Sans., but
the Pahl. text may be translated 'how wonderful *it is*, it is
sagaciously constructed.'

<span id="fn_721"></span>[144:2](sbe24075.htm#fr_729.md) Assuming that Pâz.
p*e*gh, as well as pih in § 69 and peh in § 71, stands for Pahl. pîk
(Pers. pî), 'fat' It might also be connected with Pers. pikah, 'a veil,'
as Nêr. seems to have understood it here; but 'fat' suits the whole
context better.

<span id="fn_722"></span>[144:3](sbe24075.htm#fr_730.md) Reading lag,
instead of rag, 'a vein,' which latter is adopted by Nêr. both here and
in § 71.

<span id="fn_723"></span>[145:1](sbe24075.htm#fr_731.md) As means of
defence.

<span id="fn_724"></span>[145:2](sbe24075.htm#fr_732.md) By the assistance
of the senses mentioned in § 81.

<span id="fn_725"></span>[146:1](sbe24075.htm#fr_733.md) Âtû*r*-frôbag (see
Chap. IV, 107).

<span id="fn_726"></span>[146:2](sbe24075.htm#fr_734.md) Nearly all the
Pahlavi manuscripts of this work terminate here.
