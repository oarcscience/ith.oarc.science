### CHAPTER XLII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'How many kinds of man
are *there?*'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: '*There* are three kinds of
man, (5) one is man, one is demi-man, and one is demi-demon.

6\. 'A man is he who is without doubt as to the creativeness of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the destructiveness of Aharman, and the existence of the
resurrection and future existence; and also *as regards* every other
happiness and misery, in the worldly and spiritual

*existences*, (7) that *its* origin is from both of those *beings*, from
Aûha*r*ma*zd* and Aharman. 8. And his belief is in this one pure, good
religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers; (9) and he does not believe in, and
does not hearken unto, any heterodoxy.

10\. 'A demi-man is he who performs the affairs of the worldly, and
spiritual *existences* according to his own opinion, self-conceitedly
and obstinately; (11) be they duties and good works by the will of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, *or* be they by the will of Aharman, they proceed from
him.

12\. 'A demi-demon is he in whom *there* is only as *it were* the name
of man <span id="fr_442"></span>[1](#fn_437) and the human race, *but*
in his doing of every action *he* is then like unto a two-legged demon.
13. He understands no worldly and no spiritual *existence*, (14) he
understands no good work and no sin, (15) he understands no heaven and
no hell, (16) and even the account which is *to be rendered* by the soul
he does not think of.'
