### CHAPTER XXVII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Wherefore have the
people who *were* from Gâyômar*d* <span id="fr_292"></span>[1](#fn_288.md),
*and* those, too, who *were* lords and monarchs, from Hôshâng <span
id="fr_293"></span>[2](#fn_289.md), the Pê*s*dâ*d*, even unto
Vi*s*tâsp <span id="fr_294"></span>[3](#fn_290.md), the king of kings, been
such doers of *their own* wills? 3. Much benefit *was* also obtained by
them from the sacred beings, (4) *and* they have been mostly those who
*were* ungrateful unto the sacred beings, (5) and there are *some* even
who have been very ungrateful, promise-breaking, *and* sinful. 6. For
what benefit then have they *been* severally created, (7) and what
result and advantage proceeded from them?'

8\. The spirit of wisdom answered (9) thus: 'That which thou askest
concerning them, as to benefit, or *as to* the reverse <span
id="fr_295"></span>[4](#fn_291.md), thou shouldst become aware of and fully
understand. 10. Because the affairs of the world of every kind proceed
through destiny and time and the supreme decree of the self-existent
eternity (zôrvân), the king and long-continuing lord. 11. Since, at
various periods, it happens unto every one, for whom it is allotted,
just as that which is necessary to happen. 12. As even from the mutual
connection of those ancients, who are passed

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

away, it is manifest (13) that, ultimately, that benefit arose which was
necessary to come from them to the creatures of Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

14\. 'Because the advantage from Gâyômar*d* was this, (15) first, the
slaying of Ârzûr <span id="fr_296"></span>[1](#fn_292.md), and making
delivery of his own body, with great judiciousness, to Aharman <span
id="fr_297"></span>[2](#fn_293.md). 16. *And* the second advantage was
this, (17) that mankind and all the guardian spirits of the producers of
the renovation *of the universe*, males <span
id="fr_298"></span>[3](#fn_294.md) *and* females <span
id="fr_299"></span>[4](#fn_295.md), *were* produced from his body. 18.
*And*, thirdly, this <span id="fr_300"></span>[5](#fn_296.md), that even
the metals *were* produced *and* formed <span
id="fr_301"></span>[6](#fn_297.md) from his body <span
id="fr_302"></span>[7](#fn_298.md).

19\. 'And the advantage from Hôshâng, the Pê*s*dâ*d*, was this, (20)
that, of three parts, he slew two parts of the demons of Mâzendar <span
id="fr_303"></span>[8](#fn_299.md), who *were* destroyers of the world.

21\. 'The advantage from Tâkhmorup <span
id="fr_304"></span>[9](#fn_300.md), the well-grown,

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

was this, (22) that the accursed evil *one*, the wicked, *was* kept by
him thirty years as a charger <span id="fr_305"></span>[1](#fn_301.md). 23.
*And* the writing of penmanship of seven kinds, which that wicked *one*
kept in concealment, he brought out to publicity.

24\. 'The advantage from the well-flocked Yimshê*d* <span
id="fr_306"></span>[2](#fn_302), son of Vîvangha, was this, (25.md) that an
immortality of six hundred years, six months, and sixteen days <span
id="fr_307"></span>[3](#fn_303.md) is provided by him for the creatures and
creation, of every kind, of the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*; (26) *and* they
are made unsuffering, undecaying, *and* undisturbed <span
id="fr_308"></span>[4](#fn_304). (27.md) Secondly, this <span
id="fr_309"></span>[5](#fn_305.md), that the enclosure formed by Yim <span
id="fr_310"></span>[6](#fn_306) *was* made by him; (28.md) *and* when that
rain of Malkôs <span id="fr_311"></span>[7](#fn_307.md) occurs—since *it*
is declared in revelation that mankind and

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

the other creatures and creations of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the lord, are mostly
those which shall perish <span id="fr_312"></span>[1](#fn_308)—(29.md)
*one* shall afterwards open the gate of that enclosure formed by Yim,
(30) *and* the people *and* cattle, and other creatures and creations of
the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*, shall come out from that enclosure, (31) and
arrange the world again. 32. Thirdly, (33) when <span
id="fr_313"></span>[2](#fn_309.md) he brought back the proportion of the
worldly *existences*, which that evil-producing wicked *one* <span
id="fr_314"></span>[3](#fn_310.md) had swallowed, from his belly <span
id="fr_315"></span>[4](#fn_311). Fourthly, when a goat (gôspend.md) *was*
not given by him to the demons in the character of an old man <span
id="fr_316"></span>[5](#fn_312.md).

34\. 'And the advantage from A*z*-î Dahâk, the

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bêvarâsp <span
id="fr_317"></span>[1](#fn_313.md), and the accursed Frâsîyâk of Tûr <span
id="fr_318"></span>[1](#fn_313) was this, (35.md) that, if the dominion
should not have come to Bêvarâsp *and* Frâsîyâk, the accursed evil
spirit would then have given that dominion unto Aeshm <span
id="fr_319"></span>[2](#fn_314); (36.md) and when it would have come unto
Aeshm, it would not have been possible to take *it* away from him till
the resurrection *and* future existence, (37) for this reason, because
he has no bodily existence <span id="fr_320"></span>[3](#fn_315.md).

38\. 'And the advantage from Frê*d*ûn <span
id="fr_321"></span>[4](#fn_316) was this, (39.md) such as the vanquishing
*and* binding of A*z*-î Dahâk, the Bêvarâsp <span
id="fr_322"></span>[5](#fn_317.md), who *was* so grievously sinful. 40.
And, again too, many demons of Mâzendar <span
id="fr_323"></span>[6](#fn_318.md) were smitten by him, and expelled from
the region of Khvanîras <span id="fr_324"></span>[7](#fn_319.md).

41\. 'And the advantage from Mânû*sk*îhar <span
id="fr_325"></span>[8](#fn_320) was this, (42, 43.md) that, in revenge for
Aîrî*k*, who was his grandfather, Salm and Tû*g* *were* kept back by him
from disturbing the world <span id="fr_326"></span>[9](#fn_321.md). 44.
From the land of

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
Pa*d*ashKhvârgar <span id="fr_327"></span>[1](#fn_322.md) unto the
beginning of Dû*g*akŏ <span id="fr_328"></span>[2](#fn_323.md), such as
Frâsîyâk <span id="fr_329"></span>[3](#fn_324.md) had taken, by treaty
(pa*d*mânŏ) <span id="fr_330"></span>[4](#fn_325.md) he seized back from
Frâsîyâk, *and* brought *it* into the possession of the countries of
Irân. *And as to* the enlargement of the sea of Kânsâî <span
id="fr_331"></span>[5](#fn_326.md), such as Frâsîyâk supplied, he also
expelled the water from it.

45\. 'And the advantage from Kaî-Kavâ*d* <span
id="fr_332"></span>[6](#fn_327.md) was

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

this, (46) that he became a thanksgiver unto the sacred beings. 47.
Dominion, also, *was* well exercised by him, (48) *and* the family and
race of the Kayâns proceeded again from him.

49\. 'And the advantage from Sâhm\] <span
id="fr_333"></span>[1](#fn_328) was \[this\], (50.md) that the serpent
Srôvar <span id="fr_334"></span>[2](#fn_329.md) and the wolf Kapû*d* <span
id="fr_335"></span>[3](#fn_330.md), which they also call Pêhînŏ <span
id="fr_336"></span>[4](#fn_331.md), the watery demon Gandarep <span
id="fr_337"></span>[5](#fn_332.md), the bird Kamak <span
id="fr_338"></span>[6](#fn_333.md), and the deluding demon *were* slain by
him. 51. And he also performed many other great and valuable actions,
(52) and kept back much disturbance from the world, (53) *as to* which,
when one of those disturbances, in particular, should have remained
behind, it would not have been possible to produce the resurrection and
future existence.

54\. 'And the advantage from Kâî-Ûs <span
id="fr_339"></span>[7](#fn_334.md) was this,

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (55) as
Sîyâvakhsh <span id="fr_340"></span>[1](#fn_335.md) *was* produced from his
body. 56. Many other actions also proceeded from him.

57\. 'And the advantage from Sîyâvakhsh was this, (58) such as the
begetting of Kaî-Khûsrôî <span id="fr_341"></span>[2](#fn_336.md), and the
formation of Kangde*z* <span id="fr_342"></span>[3](#fn_337.md).

59\. 'And the advantage from Kaî-Khûsrôî was this, (60) such as the
slaying of Frâsîyâk <span id="fr_343"></span>[4](#fn_338), (61.md) the
extirpation of the idol-temples which *were* on the lake of
*K*ê*k*ast <span id="fr_344"></span>[5](#fn_339), (62.md) and the
management of Kangde*z*. 63. And *he* is able to do good through his
assistance of the raising of the dead <span
id="fr_345"></span>[6](#fn_340.md) *by* the restorer of the dead, the
triumphant Sôshâns <span id="fr_346"></span>[7](#fn_341.md), which is in
the future existence.

64\. 'And the advantage from Kai-Lôharâsp <span
id="fr_347"></span>[8](#fn_342.md) was

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

this, (65) that dominion was well exercised by him, (66) and he became a
thanksgiver unto the sacred beings. 67. He demolished the Jerusalem of
the Jews <span id="fr_348"></span>[1](#fn_343.md), and made the Jews
dispersed *and* scattered; *and* the accepter of the religion,
Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp <span id="fr_349"></span>[2](#fn_344.md), *was* produced from
his body.

68\. 'And the advantage from Vi*s*tâsp was this, (69) such as the
acceptance and solemnization of the good religion of the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers, (70) through the divine voice (bakân aêvâ*z*) *of*
the Ahunavar <span id="fr_350"></span>[3](#fn_345.md), the word of the
creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*; (71) the annihilation and destruction of the
bodies of the demons and fiends; (72) and the pleasure and comfort of
water and fire and all the angels and spirits of the worldly
*existences* <span id="fr_351"></span>[4](#fn_346.md). 73. And *he was*
full of the hope of the good and worthy, (74) through a virtuous desire
for his own determination, (75) the compensation (nô*s* da*s*nŏ) <span
id="fr_352"></span>[5](#fn_347.md) and gratification of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, with
the archangels, (76) and the affliction and destruction of Aharman and
the <span id="fr_353"></span>[6](#fn_348.md) miscreations.'

to have reigned for forty years (see Bd. XV, 21-28, XXXI, I, XXXIV, 4).

<span id="fn_292"></span>[58:1](sbe24033.htm#fr_296.md) Written Aîrzûr in
TD2. It has been suggested by Windischmann (Zor. Stud. p. 5) that this
was the name of a demon, afterwards applied to the Are*z*ûr ridge at the
gate of hell (see Bd. XII, 8), but this requires confirmation. Regarding
this ridge the following explanation occurs in the Pahlavi Rivâyat which
precedes Dd. in many MSS.:—'They say that hell is the ridge (pûstŏ) of
Arekzûr; and hell is not the ridge of Arekzûr, but that place where the
gate of hell *exists* is a ridge (grîvakŏ) such as the ridge named
Arekzûr, and owing to that they assert that *it is* the ridge (pûstŏ) of
Arekzûr.' The explainer appears to mean that the ridge at the gate of
hell was named after the other Mount Are*z*ûr, in Arûm (see Bd. XII,
16).

stated in Bd. XXX, x7.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[58:5](sbe24033.htm#fr_300.md) L19 has 'this
advantage.'

<span id="fn_297"></span>[58:6](sbe24033.htm#fr_301.md) L19 omits the
former verb.

referring probably to the demon-worshippers of Mâzendarân, south of the
Caspian.

<span id="fn_300"></span>[58:9](sbe24033.htm#fr_304.md) Av. Takhmô-urupa,
the Tahmûras of the Shâhnâmah; he <span id="page_59">p. 59</span> is
said to have been a great-grandson of Hôshâng, whom he succeeded on the
throne, and to have reigned thirty years (see Bd. XXXI, 2, XXXIV, 4).
Written Takhmôrî*d*ŏ in TD2.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[59:1](sbe24033.htm#fr_305.md) See Râm Yt. 12,
Zamyâ*d* Yt. 29.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[59:2](sbe24033.htm#fr_306.md) Av. Yima khshaêta,
'Yim the [splendid](errata.htm#3.md);' he was a brother of his predecessor,
Tâkhmorup, and the Bundahi*s* states that he reigned six hundred and
sixteen years and six months in glory, and one hundred years in
concealment (see Chap. VIII, 27, Bd. XXXI, 3, XXXIV, 4).

<span id="fn_303"></span>[59:3](sbe24033.htm#fr_307.md) TD2 has only 'three
hundred years,' by the accidental omission of a cipher; it also omits
the months and days.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[59:4](sbe24033.htm#fr_308.md) See Vend. II, 16,
Râm Yt. 16, Zamyâ*d* Yt. 33.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[59:5](sbe24033.htm#fr_309.md) L19 has 'this
advantage.'

<span id="fn_306"></span>[59:6](sbe24033.htm#fr_310.md) See Chap. LXII,
15-19. The formation of this enclosure is ordered by Aûha*r*ma*zd* in
Vend. II, 61-92, for the preservation of mankind, animals, and plants
from the effects of a glacial epoch which he foretells, and which is
here represented as the rain of Malkôs.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[59:7](sbe24033.htm#fr_311.md) This term for
'deluging rain' may be traced either to Chald. ‏מַלְקוֹשׁ‎ 'autumnal
rain,' or to Av. mahrkû*s*ô, the title of a demon regarding whom nothing
is yet known (see Dd. XXXVII, 94 n and SBE, vol. xviii, p. 479).

<span id="fn_308"></span>[60:1](sbe24033.htm#fr_312.md) L19 has merely
'shall mostly perish,' in place of these last six words.

<span id="fn_309"></span>[60:2](sbe24033.htm#fr_313.md) L19 has 'thirdly,
this advantage, that.'

<span id="fn_310"></span>[60:3](sbe24033.htm#fr_314.md) L19 adds 'who is
Aharman.'

<span id="fn_311"></span>[60:4](sbe24033.htm#fr_315.md) According to a
legend preserved in the Persian Rivâyats (see MH10, fol. 52) Aharman,
while kept as a charger by Tâkhmorup, induced the wife of the latter to
ascertain from her husband whether he ever felt fear while riding the
fiend, and, acting upon the information thus obtained, he threw the king
from his back while descending from the Albur*z* mountains, and
swallowed him. Information of this event was conveyed to Yim by the
angel Srôsh, who advised him to seek the fiend and propitiate him. Yim,
accordingly, went into the wilderness singing, to attract Aharman, and,
when the fiend appeared, Yim ingratiated himself into his favour and,
taking advantage of an unguarded moment, he dragged Tâkhmorup out of the
fiend's entrails, and placed the corpse in a depository for the dead. In
consequence of this feat his hand was attacked with leprosy, from which
he suffered greatly until it was accidentally washed in bull's urine,
which healed it. This legend is related for the purpose of recommending
the use of bull's urine for purification of the body.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[60:5](sbe24033.htm#fr_316.md) Or, perhaps, 'as a
substitute for an old man.' This fourth advantage is found only in TD2,
where the text is as follows:—'*K*ahârûm, amata*s* gôspend pavan
gôharî*k*-î pîr va*l* *s*êdân lâ. yehabûntô.'

<span id="fn_313"></span>[61:1](sbe24033.htm#fr_318.md) See Chap. VIII, 29.

<span id="fn_314"></span>[61:2](sbe24033.htm#fr_319.md) The demon of wrath
(see Chap. II, 115).

<span id="fn_315"></span>[61:3](sbe24033.htm#fr_320.md) And would,
therefore, have continued to live and reign till the resurrection.

<span id="fn_316"></span>[61:4](sbe24033.htm#fr_321.md) See Chap. VIII, 27.
He is said to have reigned for five hundred years (see Bd. XXXIV, 6),
but this period includes the lives of ten generations of his descendants
who did not reign (see Bd. XXXI, 14).

<span id="fn_317"></span>[61:5](sbe24033.htm#fr_322.md) He is said to have
been confined in Mount Dimâvand (see Bd. XXIX, 9).

<span id="fn_318"></span>[61:6](sbe24033.htm#fr_323.md) See § 20.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[61:7](sbe24033.htm#fr_324.md) The central region
of the earth, containing all the countries best known to the Irânians,
and supposed to be as large as the six outer regions united (see Bd. XI,
2-6).

<span id="fn_320"></span>[61:8](sbe24033.htm#fr_325.md) The successor of
Frê*d*ûn, who reigned one hundred and twenty years (see Bd. XXXIV, 6).
He was a descendant, in the tenth generation, from Aîrî*k*, one of the
sons of Frê*d*ûn, who had been slain by his brothers Salm and Tû*g* (see
Bd. XXXI, 9-14).

<span id="fn_321"></span>[61:9](sbe24033.htm#fr_326.md) L19 has 'that he
slew Salm and Tû*g*, who were his great-uncles, <span id="page_62">p.
62</span> in revenge for Aîrî*k*, and kept them back from disturbing the
world.'

<span id="fn_322"></span>[62:1](sbe24033.htm#fr_327.md) The mountainous
region in Taparistân and Gîlân, south of the Caspian (see Bd. XII, 17).

<span id="fn_323"></span>[62:2](sbe24033.htm#fr_328.md) L19 has 'hell.'
This Dû*g*akŏ may possibly be meant for the Du*z*akô of Vend. I, 34, of
which Vaêkereta was the chief settlement, and this latter is identified
with Kâ*v*ûl (Kâbul) by the Pahlavi translators. The name can also be
read Gan*g*akŏ, which might be identified with Canzaca, but this would
not correspond so well with the legend, alluded to in the text, which
relates how Mânû*sk*îhar, having shut himself up in the impregnable
fortress of Âmul in Taparistân, could not be conquered by Frâsîyâk, who
was compelled to come to terms, whereby all the country within an
arrow-shot east of Mount Dimâvand should remain subject to Mânû*sk*îhar.
The arrow was shot and kept on its flight from dawn till noon, when it
fell on the bank of the Oxus, which river was thenceforward considered
the frontier of the Irânians. This frontier would fully include all the
territory between Taparistân and Kâbul mentioned in the text. In Bd.
XXXI, 21 the success of Mânû*sk*îhar is attributed to some dispute
between Frâsîyâk and his brother, Aghrêra*d*.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[62:3](sbe24033.htm#fr_329.md) See Chap. VIII, 29
n.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[62:4](sbe24033.htm#fr_330.md) L19 has 'such as
was made the portion (pa*d*mânŏ) of Frâsîyâk.'

<span id="fn_326"></span>[62:5](sbe24033.htm#fr_331.md) Called Kyânsîh in
Bd. XIII, 16, XX, 34, where it is stated that it was formerly fresh, but
latterly salt, and that Frâsîyâk diverted many rivers and streams into
it. It is the brackish lake and swamp now called Hâmûn, 'the desert,' or
Zarah, 'the sea,' in Sîstân. In the Avesta it is called Kãsu, and the
future apostles of the Ma*zd*a-worshipping faith are expected to be born
on its shores.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[62:6](sbe24033.htm#fr_332.md) Av. Kavi Kavâta,
the Kaî-Qubâd of the Shâhnâmah. He <span id="page_63">p. 63</span> was
the founder of the Kayân dynasty, and reigned fifteen years (see Bd.
XXXI, 24, 25, XXXIV, 7).

<span id="fn_328"></span>[63:1](sbe24033.htm#fr_333.md) The brackets
indicate the end of the passage taken from TD2 and the Pâzand version,
in consequence of the nine folios containing Chaps. XIV, 1-XXVII, 49
being lost from K43. From this point the translation follows the text of
K43. Sâhm (Av. Sâma) was the family name of the hero Keresâsp (see
Fravar*d*in Yt. 61, 136), who was a son of Thrita the Sâman (see Yas.
IX, 30, 31). For the legends relating to him, see SBE, vol. xviii, pp.
369382. His name is written Sâm in Pâzand.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[63:2](sbe24033.htm#fr_334.md) Av. a*z*i srvara
(see Yas. IX, 34-39, Zamyâ*d* Yt. 40).

<span id="fn_330"></span>[63:3](sbe24033.htm#fr_335.md) Or 'the blue wolf;'
not yet identified in the Avesta.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[63:4](sbe24033.htm#fr_336.md) Darmesteter (SBE,
vol. xxiii, p. 295, note 4) identifies this name with Pathana of
Zamyâ*d* Yt. 41, which seems to mean 'highwayman;' but this
identification appears to depend merely on similarity of sound.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[63:5](sbe24033.htm#fr_337.md) Av. Ga*n*darewa of
Âbân Yt. 38, Râm Yt. 28, Zamyâ*d* Yt. 41.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[63:6](sbe24033.htm#fr_338.md) A gigantic bird
mentioned in the Persian Rivâyats as overshadowing the earth and keeping
off the rain, while it ate up men and animals like grains of corn, until
Keresâsp killed it with arrows shot continuously for seven days and
nights.

<span id="fn_334"></span>[63:7](sbe24033.htm#fr_339.md) See Chap. VIII, 27
n. He was a grandson of Kaî-Kavâ*d*, <span id="page_64">p. 64</span>
whom he succeeded, and is said to have reigned a hundred and fifty years
(see Bd. XXXI, 25, XXXIV, 7), but perhaps this period may have included
the reign of his father, whom tradition has nearly forgotten.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[64:1](sbe24033.htm#fr_340.md) Av. Syâvarshân, the
Siyâvush of the Shâhnâmah. Though both his father and son were kings, he
did not reign himself. L19 has Kaî-Syâvash.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[64:2](sbe24033.htm#fr_341.md) See Chap. II, 95.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[64:3](sbe24033.htm#fr_342.md) Av. Kangha. A
fortified settlement said to have been 'in the direction of the east, at
many leagues from the bed of the wide-formed ocean towards that side,'
and on the frontier of Aîrân-vê*g* (see Chap. LXII, 13, Bd. XXIX, 10).

<span id="fn_338"></span>[64:4](sbe24033.htm#fr_343.md) See Chap. VIII, 29.
This name must have been applied rather to a dynasty than to a single
individual, as he reigned in Irân in the time of Mânû*sk*îhar, nearly
two hundred years earlier.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[64:5](sbe24033.htm#fr_344.md) See Chap. II, 95.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[64:6](sbe24033.htm#fr_345.md) He is expected to
assist in the renovation of the universe at the resurrection, together
with Keresâsp and other heroes (see Chap. LVII, 7, Dd. XXXVI, 3).

<span id="fn_341"></span>[64:7](sbe24033.htm#fr_346.md) See Chap. II, 95.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[64:8](sbe24033.htm#fr_347.md) Av. Kavi and
Aurva*d*aspa. He was a descendant of Kaî-Kavâ*d* in the fifth
generation, being a second cousin once removed of his predecessor,
Kaî-Khûsrôî, and reigned a hundred and twenty years (see Bd. XXXI, 25,
28, XXXIV, 7).

<span id="fn_343"></span>[65:1](sbe24033.htm#fr_348.md) Aûrî*s*alêm-i
Yahû*d*ânŏ. The first fourteen words of § 67 do not occur in the
Pâz.-Sans. version, but a corresponding statement is found in a Persian
metrical version, described by Sachau in his Contributions to the
Knowledge of Parsee Literature (J*RAS*., New Series, vol. iv, pp.
229-283), also in the works of several Arab writers of the tenth century
(see Nŏldeke, Gŏt. gel. Anz. 188 2, p. 964).

<span id="fn_344"></span>[65:2](sbe24033.htm#fr_349.md) See Chap. XIII, 14
n.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[65:3](sbe24033.htm#fr_350.md) The most sacred
formula of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers, consisting of twenty-one words,
forming three metrical lines of sixteen syllables each, beginning with
yathâ ahû vairyô, 'as a patron spirit is desirable.' It is supposed to
have been uttered by Aûha*r*ma*zd*, for the discomfiture of Aharman, on
the first appearance of that evil spirit in the universe (see Bd. I,
21).

<span id="fn_346"></span>[65:4](sbe24033.htm#fr_351.md) L19 has 'all the
angels of the spiritual and worldly *existences*.'

<span id="fn_347"></span>[65:5](sbe24033.htm#fr_352.md) L19 has u
shnâi*s*n, 'and the propitiation.'

<span id="fn_348"></span>[65:6](sbe24033.htm#fr_353.md) L19 has 'his.'
