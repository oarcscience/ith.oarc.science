### CHAPTER LII.

1\. The fifty-second subject is this, that it is incumbent on every one
that, every year *when* the month Fravardîn comes on, *he is* to provide
a sacred cake *on* the day Khurdâ*d* <span
id="fr_1355"></span>[1](#fn_1344.md), and whatever they are able to bring
to hand, *a little* of everything, *they are* to place by that sacred
cake, and to consecrate *it* with the dedicatory *formula*
Ayaranãm*k*a <span id="fr_1356"></span>[2](#fn_1345.md), so that

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

the affairs of that year may be better through that day's provision and
the entry and coming in *of guests*.

2\. For it is declared in revelation <span
id="fr_1357"></span>[1](#fn_1346.md), that, every year, when the day
Khurdâ*d* of the month Fravardîn comes on, they allot a daily provision
*for* mankind, and whatever *one* wishes to pass to the lot of mankind
in that year they write down that day. 3. Therefore, when they shall
consecrate this sacred cake, the archangel Khurdâ*d* <span
id="fr_1358"></span>[2](#fn_1347.md) is making intercession for that
person.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1344"></span>[314:1](sbe24140.htm#fr_1355.md) That is, on the
sixth day of the first month of the Parsi year, a day which is called
Khurdâ*d*-sâl and kept sacred, because it is said to be the anniversary
of many remarkable events, of which the following are mentioned in a
Pahlavi tract that is also translated in the Persian Rivâyats (B29, fol.
401):—On that day worldly life was created, Gâyômar*d* came into the
world and slew Are*z*ûr, Mashya and Mashyôî grew up from the ground,
Hôshâng appeared, Takhmôrup made Aharman his steed, Yim made the world
free from death and decay, brought on a truce (? pa*d*mânak) with hell,
and established depositories for the dead and new year's day, Frê*d*ûn
divided the world between his three sons, Mânû*sk*îhar slew two of them,
and rescued the world from Frâsyâk, Sâm the Narîmânian slew the demon
Gandarêpak (?); Kaî-Khûsrôî slew Frâsyâk and went to heaven, leaving the
sovereignty to Lôrâsp, Zaratû*s*t came to converse with Aûha*r*ma*zd*
and received the religion from him, Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp accepted the religion,
eighteen things come in eighteen years to Khûsrô son of Aûha*r*ma*zd*,
Vâhrâm the Var*g*âvand comes from the Hindûs, Pêshyôtanû, son of
Vi*s*tâsp, comes from Kangde*z*, Hûshê*d*ar comes to converse with
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, Sâm slays A*z*-î Dahâk and rules till Kai-Khûsrôî
reappears to reign for fifty-seven years, with Sôshâns as supreme
high-priest, after which Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp resumes the sovereignty, and
Zaratû*s*t the priestship, and the resurrection takes place on the same
day of the year.
