### CHAPTER XXIII.

1\. The twenty-third subject is this, that it is requisite to restrain a
tethered *animal* from misbehaviour, and to keep watch *over* one's own
*creatures*, especially *at* the time when they have eaten meat.

2\. Therefore, if they have eaten meat *and* they commit an assault,
every offence that the animal (‘haîvân) commits may be that person's
whose meat may be eaten. 3. For example, if a horse lashes *out* a kick
(lakad) at any one, the offence may be that person's whose food may be
eaten and caused the offence.

4\. Therefore it is necessary to make an endeavour that they *shall*
commit no offence whatever, especially at a time when they have eaten
meat.
