### CHAPTER XXXVII.

1\. The thirty-seventh subject is this, that, when *the days of* the
guardian spirits <span id="fr_1286"></span>[1](#fn_1276) come on, it is
necessary that all persons, among their own food and devotion, *should*
order *and* provide the sacred cakes and ceremonial, the sacred feast
and benedictions (âfrîngân). 2. *For* these ten days it is incumbent on
every one; *and* those are better which they prepare in their own
houses, because the souls <span id="fr_1287"></span>[2](#fn_1277) go
every one to its own house. 3. And they *should* have an ear for
them <span id="fr_1288"></span>[3](#fn_1278), so that they *may* prepare
the sacred cakes and feast and benedictions.

4\. Those ten days any one of all the souls—*that* are in this
*way* <span id="fr_1289"></span>[4](#fn_1279) in every house where they
provide the feast more abundantly—proclaims, as to that master of the
house <span id="fr_1290"></span>[5](#fn_1280), that family, and the
whole who are in that house, and the year's affairs of every kind,
*that* they are very good, and their entry (da‘*h*l) and coming in are
very good. 5. And every single

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

good work, on account of which we have spoken of the souls of the
departed, becomes just like those we have done for our own souls. 6.
And, when they pass away from this worldly *existence*, those souls come
again, meeting them, and cause gladness, maintain <span
id="fr_1291"></span>[1](#fn_1281) their courage, and also render *them*
honour in the presence of the creator Hôrmazd, and speak *thus:*
'*These* righteous souls did not put us away from remembrance while they
were in the world, *and* we have been satisfied with them; now we are
unanimous that thou *shouldest* provide them equal shares of those good
works of ours, *and* make their souls attain to the position of the
righteous.' 7. They utter these words, and give those souls confidence,
while they make out their account. 8. Afterwards, with them, they make
the passage of the *K*inva*d* bridge, till they arrive at their own
position, *and* then they return.

9\. Therefore it is necessary to make an effort, so that they *may*
maintain the guardian spirits properly, and the souls of *their* fathers
and mothers and relations *may* exist with honour from them. 10. For if
they retire with dissatisfaction they utter a curse, *and*, as the soul
departs from this world, they administer reproaches to it, and speak
*thus:* 'Thou thinkest that they wish continually to make a way <span
id="fr_1292"></span>[2](#fn_1282) for thee *to* that place, *but* it is
not necessary for thee to come into this world <span
id="fr_1293"></span>[3](#fn_1283). 11. Now, hadst thou performed duty
*and* good works on our behalf, and hadst thou recollected us, we would
also have come to thy assistance, and would have released thee from

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

this fearful position.' 12. And that *soul* experiences much repentance,
and has no advantage whatever *from it*.
