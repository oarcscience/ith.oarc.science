### CHAPTER XXXII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'What is the business
of the well-endeavouring <span id="fr_371"></span>[6](#fn_366.md), the
artizans?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'The business of the
artizans is this, (5) that *as to* that work which they do not
understand, they do not bring a hand to it; (6) and that which they
well <span id="fr_372"></span>[7](#fn_367.md)

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

understand (hû-dânend), they perform well *and* with attention; (7) and
they demand wages lawfully. (8). For *as to him* who persists in doing
that work which <span id="fr_373"></span>[1](#fn_368.md) he does not
understand, it is *he by* whom that work is spoiled and becomes useless;
and when, moreover, he is a man whose work makes himself satisfied, it
then becomes even an origin of sin for him.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_366"></span>[68:6](sbe24038.htm#fr_371.md) The hûtûkhshân (Av.
hûiti) are the fourth class of the community, and are very rarely
mentioned in the Avesta, possibly because they were originally enslaved
outcasts or aborigines, as in other ancient communities. The passage
where they are specially mentioned (Yas. XIX, 46) is probably taken from
the Bagh Nask (see Sls. X, 26 n; XIII, 1 n, 9 n).

<span id="fn_367"></span>[68:7](sbe24038.htm#fr_372.md) L19 omits 'well.'

<span id="fn_368"></span>[69:1](sbe24038.htm#fr_373.md) L19 omits 'work,'
and K43 omits 'which.'
