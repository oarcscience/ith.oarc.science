### CHAPTER XLV.

1\. The forty-fifth subject is this, that it is continually necessary
that *people should* keep in remembrance the accomplishment of
repentance (taûbat). 2. Every time that a sin leaps from control it is
necessary to act so that they go before the priests, high-priests, and
*spiritual* chiefs, and accomplish repentance.

3\. And <span id="fr_1332"></span>[1](#fn_1321) in accordance with the
sin *should be* the good work, just as though the good work *were* due
to that occasion when they accomplish *it*. 4. While mankind are living,
it becomes every year a further benefit. 5. Sin is also, *in* like
manner, going *on* to a head every year; and when they accomplish
repentance, so that it *may* not increase further, it is just like a
tree that becomes withered, and they extirpate its further growth.

6\. And that repentance is better which they accomplish before
high-priests and *spiritual* chiefs, and when they accomplish the
retribution that the high-priest orders every sin that exists departs
from them. 7. The repentance *that* high-priests accomplish they
likewise call repentance <span id="fr_1333"></span>[2](#fn_1322). 8. If
*there* be no high-priest it is necessary to go before some persons who
are commissioned *by* high-priests; and if those, also, do not exist, it
is necessary to go to a man *who is* a friend of the soul, *and* to
accomplish the repentance.

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

9\. At the time when *one* shall depart from the world it is incumbent
on sons and daughters and relations, that they give repentance into the
mouth of the afflicted *one, and that* they give the Ashem-vohû <span
id="fr_1334"></span>[1](#fn_1323) into *his* mouth. 10. For the
high-priests have said that, when they have accomplished repentance
because they have committed many sins, they do not arrive in hell, *but*
they administer punishment *to them* at the head of the *K*inva*d*
bridge, and afterwards conduct *them* to their own place.

11\. Repentance is that when they accomplish repentance of the sin which
they have committed, and do not commit that sin a second *time;* if they
do commit *it*, that *first sin* then comes back <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[2](#fn_1324).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1321"></span>[308:1](sbe24133.htm#fr_1332) Lp, B29 have
'for.'

<span id="fn_1322"></span>[308:2](sbe24133.htm#fr_1333) Here and
throughout the rest of the chapter B29 has patit, 'renunciation *of
sin*,' instead of taûbat. The outward form of repentance consists of the
recitation of the patit, in which all imaginable sins are mentioned and
renounced.

<span id="fn_1323"></span>[309:1](sbe24133.htm#fr_1334) See Chap. VII, 1
n.

<span id="fn_1324"></span>[309:2](sbe24133.htm#fr_1335) That is,
repentance is not a mere penance, but requires a change of will, a
veritable renunciation of that sin for the future; otherwise it is
useless.
