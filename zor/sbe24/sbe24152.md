### CHAPTER LXIV.

1\. The sixty-fourth subject is this, that it is necessary to practise
great abstinence from committing theft <span
id="fr_1412"></span>[5](#fn_1401) and seizing anything from mankind by
force.

2\. For it is declared in revelation that, *as to* every one who steals
one dirham <span id="fr_1413"></span>[6](#fn_1402) away from another,
when they really know *it*, it is necessary to take two dirhams away
from him; one dirham *being* that which *was* carried off, and one
dirham as the fine of him who committed the theft. 3. It is also
requisite to cut *off* one ear, and it is necessary to strike ten *blows
with* a stick, and to detain *him* one period in prison.

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

4\. And if he shall steal another <span
id="fr_1414"></span>[1](#fn_1403) dirham, in the same manner *one* is to
take away two dirhams <span id="fr_1415"></span>[2](#fn_1404), to cut
*off* the other ear, to strike twenty *blows with* a stick, and to
detain *him* two periods <span id="fr_1416"></span>[3](#fn_1405) in
prison. 5. And if he shall steal three dirhams and two dângs <span
id="fr_1417"></span>[4](#fn_1406), it is requisite to cut *off his*
right hand. 6. If he shall steal five hundred dirhams <span
id="fr_1418"></span>[5](#fn_1407), it is requisite to hang *him*.

7\. *On* the spot the punishment is this, and among the spirits it
brings punishment on the soul itself. 8. And, if the *other* person does
not know *it*, they take away twice as much good work, among the
spirits, from that *thief*, and give *it* to the soul of this person. 9.
If *the thief* possesses no good works, they give the compensation from
the constantly-beneficial treasury <span
id="fr_1419"></span>[6](#fn_1408), and exhibit the punishment on the
soul of that *thief*.

10\. *As to* that person who has seized anything

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

from another by force, among the spirits they seize back four
*things* <span id="fr_1420"></span>[1](#fn_1409) as compensation for
every single one. 11. And if, *on* the spot *where people* capture him,
he makes *it* convenient to return four *things* in compensation *for*
one, when they have fully understood, as they capture that person who is
committing highway-robbery, *that* he makes *it* convenient <span
id="fr_1421"></span>[2](#fn_1410), they *may* kill him at once.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1401"></span>[326:5](sbe24152.htm#fr_1412) B29, J15 have
'violence.'

<span id="fn_1402"></span>[326:6](sbe24152.htm#fr_1413) A silver coin of
63 grains in weight, or about 5 3/5 annas (see Dd. LII, 1 n); say,
seven-pence.

<span id="fn_1403"></span>[327:1](sbe24152.htm#fr_1414) Lp has 'two.'

<span id="fn_1404"></span>[327:2](sbe24152.htm#fr_1415) Lp has 'to take
four.'

<span id="fn_1405"></span>[327:3](sbe24152.htm#fr_1416) The Gu*g*arâti
translator takes 'one period' as 'one gha*d*î (24 minutes),' but 'two
periods' as '2½ gha*d*î (one hour).' The word sâ’hat, 'period,' means
also 'an hour,' but so short a term of imprisonment seems improbable.

<span id="fn_1406"></span>[327:4](sbe24152.htm#fr_1417) That is, 3½
dirhams, nearly, 1¼ rûpî, or, say, two shillings.

<span id="fn_1407"></span>[327:5](sbe24152.htm#fr_1418) That is, 175
rûpîs, or, say, £ 14 12*s*.

<span id="fn_1408"></span>[327:6](sbe24152.htm#fr_1419) Where all
supererogatory good works are supposed to be kept in store by the
angels, for the purpose of granting them to souls who deserve them, but
have been unable to acquire a sufficiency. It is said to be situated in
the 'endless light' of heaven, and is the misvânô gâtu*s* *hv*adhâtô,
'ever-benefiting place, the self-sustained,' of Vend. XIX, 122. Perhaps
gan*g*, 'treasury,' may have been originally gun*g*, 'space,' which
would better suit the idea of a 'self-sustained place' (see Dd. XXVI, 3,
XXXI, 24, XXXVII, 22, 24, XXXVIII, 3). The term 'treasurer,' applied to
the female personifications of conscience who meet the soul with the
stores of its good works and sins. (sec Sg. IV, 92-96), seems to have no
connection with this treasury of other people's good works.

<span id="fn_1409"></span>[328:1](sbe24152.htm#fr_1420) Twice as much as
in cases of theft without violence (see § 2).

<span id="fn_1410"></span>[328:2](sbe24152.htm#fr_1421) So that they may
not interfere with such benefit for his soul as he may obtain by
atonement. These old priestly laws having much more consideration for
the soul than for the body.
