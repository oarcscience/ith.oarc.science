### CHAPTER XI.

1\. Henceforth I write <span id="fr_835"></span>[1](#fn_827.md) *of* the
inconsistency of their twaddle, and *of* just observations (2) you
should estimate with wise regard.

3\. First, *as to* the full consideration of that one original evolution
(4) which they state thus: 'The sacred being is one, doing good works,
wise, powerful, compassionate, *and* merciful, (5) so that good works
*and* crime, truth *and* falsehood, life *and* death, good *and* evil
are <span id="fr_836"></span>[2](#fn_828.md) owing to him <span
id="fr_837"></span>[3](#fn_829.md).'

6\. Now do ye ask of them (7) thus: 'Is the sacred being always
compassionate *and* showing mercy, doing good works *and* judicious, and
does he know all *that* is, was, *and will* be; *and* is *he* advancing
the desire of *one's* wishes in everything, even *in* this where
judiciousness is interference, or when such is not so? 8. Because, if
*he be* compassionate, doing good works, *and* showing mercy, why then
are Aharman and the demons and all these evil faiths <span
id="fr_838"></span>[4](#fn_830.md) of hell admitted <span
id="fr_839"></span>[5](#fn_831.md)

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

by him to his own creatures, through his own compassion, doing of good
works, *and* showing of mercy? 9. If not known by him, where are that
knowledge and omniscience of his? 10. If he did not wish to keep misery
and evil away from the creatures, and to produce only happiness *for*
every one, where are that judiciousness and interference of his? 11. If
it were not possible that it should not be produced by him, for what is
that omnipotence of his (12) which we <span
id="fr_840"></span>[1](#fn_832.md) every one, as *it were*, observe *and*
well consider?'

13\. Whenever they say *that* every good and evil *has* arisen from the
sacred being—except when they separate from him these four attributes
(hûnar), requisite for divinity, which are omniscience, omnipotence,
goodness, *and* mercifulness—(14) there is then no possibility of it.
15. When, indeed, they separate from him *only* one of these four
attributes, even then *he* is not complete in divinity. 16. For if a
sacred being be he *who is* omniscient, omnipotent, good, and merciful,
then he who is not omniscient, *or* not omnipotent, *or* not good, or
not merciful is not a sacred being.

17\. Again, *observe* this, that when *he is* a ruler, advancing desires
in every person *and* thing, why are that country and empire of his own
not so kept, without help, from every enemy and adversity *apart* from
his own work, so that *there* would not be anything whatever of
distress, oppression, injustice, and complaint for any one in his
empire? 18. Since the

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

rule *and* empire of a man, *who is* ruler and emperor, are then
commendable when *it* is possible for him so to protect *and* keep his
own country *and* empire, through his own wisdom, that they *may* not
assist his enemy to detract from his work, and to produce sin *and*
harm. 19. Or, when his enemy covets *some* of his work, he is enabled to
keep him away from his own thoughtful friends, *and* to make every one
free from distress.

20\. Again, *observe* this, that when *he is* triumphant, victorious,
and prevailing, (21) over whom are that triumph, victory, and prevailing
of his? 22. Since triumph and victory are over enemies, a competitor
exists. 23. It is not expedient <span id="fr_841"></span>[1](#fn_833.md) to
become himself a competitor *and* enemy to his own; (24) while when
there is no enemy *and* competitor of his, over whom does he become
triumphant and victorious? 25. That *sort of* triumph and victory is not
spoken about, (26) because even cattle and sheep, when they have no
opponent and injurer, are victorious and triumphant over themselves.

27\. Again, *observe* this, is a wise *being* contented with his own
divinity and grandeur, or not? 28. If the wise *being* be contented,
then he *has* become contented to produce an enemy and criminal, *and*
to admit all *that is* devastating into a country, through his own
knowledge and will, for the benefit of the

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

country and creatures. 29. *But* why <span
id="fr_842"></span>[1](#fn_834.md) is it expedient to seek a disposition of
crime *and* evil, to become himself an enemy *and* curser as regards
them, *and* to provide a hellish *existence*, becoming the misery of
mankind?

30\. Again, *observe* this, *as to* whatever he says, does he speak
truly *and* credibly, or not? 31. If he speaks that truly *and* credibly
which he states thus: 'I am a friend of good works and an enemy of
crime,' (32) *and* always produces more crime *and* criminals than good
works *and* doers of good works, (33) where is that truthful speaking of
his?

34\. Again, *observe* this, is his desire goodness, or vileness? 35. If
his desire *be* vileness, whence is that divinity of his? 36. If his
desire *be* goodness, then why are the vile and vileness more than the
good and goodness?

37\. Again, *observe* this, is he merciful, or not? 38. If he *be* not
merciful, whence is that divinity of his? 39. If he *be* merciful, then
why does he speak thus: 'The hearts, ears, *and* eyes of mankind are
bent about by me, so that it is not possible for them to think, speak,
*or* do *anything* but that which is wanted by me <span
id="fr_843"></span>[2](#fn_835); (40.md) be it what *has* made them great
*and* noble, through *being* without want; (41) *or* be it what *has*
admitted them to eternal hell, slain *and* exterminated by death of many
kinds. 42. So that while those whom I force back become good *and* more
active in good works, (43) yet still those who

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

are forced back do only a little <span id="fr_844"></span>[1](#fn_836.md),
(44) *and* are much more criminal *and* more sinful than those who are
forward.'

45\. Again, *observe* this, that if, whatever he does, he does wisely
and for a purpose, (46) then, when no opponent and adversary of his
existed, why *did* the first achievement which *was* prepared by him
*become* servants to demoniacal disobedience, who are perverted thereby,
among mankind, to wickedness *and* a hellish *existence* <span
id="fr_845"></span>[2](#fn_837.md)? 47. If *it were* not known by him that
they *would* become perverted, it was expedient (sa*z*î*d*) for him to
order the making of a trial of them, (48) because now many thousands
*and* myriads who *are* prepared by him, so that they *may* serve him
and exhilarate (mastend) his rule, have become in every mode disobedient
*and* unhappily advised. 49. for with that scanty knowledge that mankind
*possess*, which is not so prepared *and* organized as is the wish of
mankind, (50) if even anything arises, that they construct *and*
prepare, which does not so come on *and* become <span
id="fr_846"></span>[3](#fn_838.md) as is their wish, they do not stop
again, a second *time*, for the preparation of that thing, *but* they
refrain from it.

51\. *As to* him, that omnipotent *and* omniscient ruler, of the
abundant *and* innumerable things *he has* hitherto made and prepared
not even one comes on *and* becomes such as is his wish, yet still he
never refrains from the preparation *and* production of many new
*things*. 52. Just as when *he was* the creator of

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

that *one* of his first angels whom, on account of affection, he
prepared out of fire, *and for* several thousand years, (53) as they
say, *they* always performed his worship; (54) at last *that one was*
undone by one command that was given by him (the creator) thus: 'Offer
homage to this first of mankind, who is prepared by me out of clay.' 55.
And deliverance, as to *what* is not expedient to offer, *was* expressly
mentioned by him. 56. Then *that one* acted scornfully *and*
contemptibly as to his clay and curse and wrath; (57) and, *being*
perverted to devilry and fiendishness, *he was* forced out of heaven,
(58) *and was* given a life of millenniums *and* an eternal dominion,
(59) so that *he said*, 'I *will* go *and* make my servants and
worshippers astray *and* deluded <span id="fr_847"></span>[1](#fn_839.md).'
60. And he *was* made an injurer and adversary at his own will.

61\. *At* last also that man, to whom he, the supreme angel, was ordered
to offer homage with many worshippers, for the sake of affection and
respect, (62) is appointed to the garden of paradise (vahi*s*t), (63)

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

so that he *may* cultivate *it* and eat all the fruit, (64) except *of*
that one tree of which *it* is ordered thus: Ye shall not eat *of
it* <span id="fr_848"></span>[1](#fn_840).' 65. And with them (mankind.md)
the deceiver, who is the deluder prepared by him (the creator), (66) is
let into the garden. 67. There are *some* who say *he is* a
serpent <span id="fr_849"></span>[2](#fn_841.md), *and* there are *some*
who *say he is* Aharman <span id="fr_850"></span>[3](#fn_842.md). 68. And
an inclination *for* eating *and* greediness is given by that same *one*
himself to mankind. 69. Then, being deceived *by* that deluder *saying:*
'Eat of that tree'—(70) there are *some* who say *he spoke to* Adam—(71)
they ate through that inclination for eating <span
id="fr_851"></span>[4](#fn_843.md).

72\. After eating they became so imbued with knowledge that good and
evil *were* understood and known by them <span
id="fr_852"></span>[5](#fn_844.md). 73: *Deprived* of that so-great respect
and affection, through that one injunction which *was* forgotten by
them—(74) and that forgetfulness *being* likewise owing to that
cause—(75) they are forced out of the garden of paradise <span
id="fr_853"></span>[6](#fn_845.md)—*he* with *his* wife—by grievous wrath
and disrespect, (76) *and* are delivered into the hand of that enemy who
is a deceiver and deluder; (77) so that he *has* propagated

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

his own will among them, *and has* fashioned *it* upon them.

78\. Now which *was* unjust, the unreasonable command, the after-wisdom,
*or* the scanty knowledge that *was* more faulty and more mischievous
than these? 79. Also this, that is, why *was* that garden not made by
him fortified and strong, so that that deluder could not have gone into
*it?*

80\. Even now he (*the deceiver*) *has* made and makes multitudes *of*
his (the creator's) servants *and* worshippers deluded; (81) and, for
the same reason, multitudes *of* apostles *and* prophets (vakhshvarân)
are appointed by him (the creator) for the worldly *existence at*
various times, (82) so that, *as he says:* 'They *may* save my servants
from the hand of that deluder, (83) *and* bring them into the true path
and way <span id="fr_854"></span>[1](#fn_846.md).' 84. And even those
worshippers of his, *in* every way through their own will, have slain
*and* subdued (khvâft), by a wretched death, his own apostles <span
id="fr_855"></span>[2](#fn_847.md), whose diligence had brought mankind
into the proper path and doctrine.

85\. That original deluder and misleader is allowed an eternal life. 86.
*And*, even till now, his will is more triumphant *and* absolute than
that of the sacred being, through deluding *and* misleading, (87)
because those deluded *and* astray are much more numerous than those in
the true path *and* undeluded.

88\. Again, *observe* this, does he do whatever he

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

does for a purpose, or not? 89. If he does *it* without a purpose, *he*
is working foolishly; (90) and it is not proper to praise him who is
working foolishly as a sagacious divinity. 91. If he does *it* for a
purpose, (92) then, when no opponent and adversary of his existed, why
is the production of all these creatures which are even like demons,
disobedient men *with* the opposing will of that contentious deluder,
and innumerable unprofitable creatures?

93\. Again, *observe* this, that, if he knows all *that* is, was, *and
will* be, it was not expedient for him to produce, through his own
knowledge and will, anything of that of which he *may be* sorry, and
*which* remains opposing his will and command, (94) and becomes an
adversary of his apostles *and* the doers of *his* will.

95\. If they say that this adversary *was* produced good and virtuous
from the beginning, *and* afterwards became an evil and a misleading of
the creatures, (96) that *implies*, you should say, that, when he is
all-powerful, the purpose *and* will of the adversary, in changing into
an evil and a misleading of the creatures, are more successful and more
powerful than those of the sacred being; (97) because the evil in *any*
period is stronger than the good.

98\. Again, *observe* this, that when a criminal *arises* wholly through
his will <span id="fr_856"></span>[1](#fn_848), (99.md) and the minds of
criminals are defiled by him himself, (100) and the seed of crime is
sown by him himself, (101) when <span id="fr_857"></span>[2](#fn_849.md)
*it has* grown who *has* maintained *its* origin? 102.

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *And* by what
power of adjudication is one executed *and* one rewarded <span
id="fr_858"></span>[1](#fn_850.md)?

103\. Again, *observe* this, *was* this world made and created by him
(the creator) for a purpose, for his own pleasure *and* for the sake of
the comfort and happiness of mankind, or without a purpose, for his own
discomfort and the hurry, trouble, pain, *and* death of mankind? 104.
For if made by him without a purpose, *he was* acting foolishly; (105) a
thing without a purpose *being* not acceptable by the wise. 106. If made
by him for a purpose, and created by him for his own pleasure and the
comfort and happiness of mankind, (107) why *was* it not made by him
prosperous *and* full of happiness?

108\. If his pleasure and happiness *arise* from the preparation of
mankind and the creatures, what is the advantage from their slaughter
and devastation? 109. If thoughts of crime are not given by him himself
to mankind, who is he who gives thoughts of crime different from his
command and will? 110. If *they* are given by him himself, and he now
considers them a fault, what is that justice and arbitration of his
owing to? 111. For when mankind, with little knowledge and little
wisdom, even then, so far as they are able, do not let the lion and wolf
*and* other noxious creatures in among their own young ones *and*
pregnant *females*, (112) so long as they can destroy them, (113) why
*has* the merciful sacred being now let <span
id="fr_859"></span>[2](#fn_851.md) Aharman and the demons in upon his own
creatures, (114) so that they have

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

made them vile <span id="fr_860"></span>[1](#fn_852.md), defiled, wicked,
*and* hellish? 115. If done for the sake of experiment, just as that
which they assert, that evil *was* created by him for the sake of an
experiment as regards the creatures, (116) why *was* it not understood
by him before those men and creatures *existed?* 117. Because *he* whose
custom <span id="fr_861"></span>[2](#fn_853.md) is experiment is not to be
called omniscient.

118\. The conclusion is this, that the sacred being, if *there* existed
no opponent and adversary of his, was able to create all those creatures
and creations of his free from misfortune; why did *he* not *so* create
*them?* 119. Or was it not possible for him to wish *it?* 120. If it
were not possible for him to wish *it, he* is not completely capable.
121. If it were possible for him not to wish *it, he* is not merciful.
122. If *it were* known by him that *he might say:* 'Something *or* some
one *will* arise, from these creatures *and* creations which I create,
that *will* not *be* according to my will,' (123) and ultimately he made
*them*, (124) then to attach now all this wrath *and* cursing and
casting away for punishment in hell, discontentedly to his own
performance, is unreasonable.

125\. Again, *observe* this, that if all the crime-meditating *and*
crime-committing sin which mankind think *and* speak *and* do, as well
as pain, sickness, poverty, *and* the punishment *and* misery of hell,
cannot arise, except by the will and command of the

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

sacred being—(126) the will *and* power of the sacred being *being*
eternal <span id="fr_862"></span>[1](#fn_854), (127.md) because his
self-existence is also eternal—(128) the hopelessness of eternally
saving any one whatever from misery and punishment is now certain. 129.
For *it* is repeatedly declared that there is no learned teacher
whatever who keeps one away from these mischievous evil desires, (130)
if the worshipper *be even of* the same kind *as* those worshippers
*and* high-priests who *have* issued to mankind this admonition: 'Commit
no crime *and* sin.' 131. Because they wish to set aside the will *and*
command of the sacred being <span id="fr_863"></span>[2](#fn_855.md). 132.
*Observe* this, too, that, as both are his will, alike crime *and* alike
good works, *it* is not manifest whether he approves the good works of
doers of good works more, or the crimes of criminals.

133\. Likewise *observe* this, those physicians who, on account of the
hope of the soul, prepare the medicine of the sick, (134) and remove
*and* dismiss their pain and disease, (115) so that merit is possessed
by them (the physicians) owing to that practice; (136) yet they <span
id="fr_864"></span>[3](#fn_856.md) are prepared for the punishment of hell.
137. And those who, on account of affection *for* the soul, give
something *to* poor, begging, suffering people, (138) and thereby
scatter <span id="fr_865"></span>[4](#fn_857.md) *and* dismiss their want
*and* poverty, (139) so that merit is possessed by them (the charitable)

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

owing to that practice; (140) yet it becomes grievous sin for them <span
id="fr_866"></span>[1](#fn_858.md), through anxiety. 141. If they say that
those physicians *and* the remedies which they offer, *and* also those
who give something *to* the poor *and* suffering, all *exist* by the
will of the sacred being, (142) it is easier, more reasonable, *and*
more adapted to divinity, when the sacred being is without an adversary
*and* without an opponent, for him not to create that disease *and*
poverty (143) than *that, as to* those that *he* himself is to make sick
*and* poor, he *should have* commanded mankind thus: 'Ye shall make them
healthy *and* free from want.' 144. If they say that his desire is this,
that he *may* occasion the happiness of those physicians *and* givers by
the recompense for it, (145) and make them proceed <span
id="fr_867"></span>[2](#fn_859.md) to the eternal happiness of heaven
(vahi*s*t); (146) you should observe, *as to* that, since he acts
injudiciously *and* incapably when, on account of the existence of a
complete desire for happiness *and* prosperity <span
id="fr_868"></span>[3](#fn_860.md) among others, *he* is an attainer of
misery *for* multitudes *of* the innocent who are distressed, poor,
necessitous, *and* sick, (147) this *may* also *be said*, that if *it
be* not possible for him to occasion happiness and prosperity <span
id="fr_869"></span>[4](#fn_861.md) as regards one, except by the distress,
pain, and vexation of some other, (148) that *shows that* his absolute
power *and* freedom from opposition are not adapted for effectual
operation. 149. If they say

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

that he makes those sick *and* poor proceed to the eternal happiness of
heaven in the spiritual *existence*, as a recompense for it, (150) that
*implies*, if *it be* not possible, *or* not completely possible, for
him to give the recompense in the spiritual *existence*, except through
the misery of the worldly *one*, (151) also this, that—his production of
distress in the worldly *existence arising* unquestionably *and*
unreasonably, through *its* previous occurrence, (152) *and* the
recompense of the spiritual *existence arising* doubtfully *and*
incredibly after the production of the distress—(153) just as the
previous distress is unreasonable, the after recompense *occurs* alike
unreasonably *and* foolishly. 154. This also *may be said*, that no
after nobility is obtained for previous distress without a cause.

155\. Again, *observe* this, that the existence of one of these three
doctrines is inevitable:—(156) Every single thing that is, *or* was, *or
will* be in this world is all by his will, or *it* is not, (157) or
there are *some* that are by his will *and* there are *some* that are
not. 158. Because nothing whatever is found which is not good, or evil,
or a mixture <span id="fr_870"></span>[1](#fn_862.md) of both.

159\. If they say that all *things* are *by* his will, the good and evil
are both his desire. 160. If good and evil are both his desire, *he* is
not of perfect will; (161) *it* is not perfect even as to a single
*thing*. 162. And he who is of imperfect will must be himself imperfect,
(163) as is shown above <span id="fr_871"></span>[2](#fn_863.md).

164\. If nothing *be by* his will, (165) on account of nothing being
*by* the will there is no will. 166. He *in* whom there is no will is
working constitutionally <span id="fr_872"></span>[3](#fn_864.md),

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (167) and he who
is working constitutionally is constituted *and* made.

168\. If there be *some things* which are *by* his will, *and* there be
*some* which are not *by* his will, (169) *and* nothing is found in the
world which is not good and not evil, (170) *from* that *it* is known
*that*, if the sacred being *be of* good will, *he* is not desirous of
that evil of it, (171) and that which is evil is not by his will. 172.
If his will *be* evil *he* is inevitably not desirous of that good of
it, (173) *and* that which is good is not by his will. 174. If that
which is good *be by* the will of the sacred being, *it* is known *that*
that which is evil arose from another will. 175. If that which is evil
*be by* his will, that which is good arose inevitably from another will.
176. *And* the inevitability *of* a rival *of* the will of the sacred
being is manifest.

177\. If *one* says the evil springs from mankind, (178) that *implies*
the inevitability—since mankind is not perpetually a
self-existence—*that* evil either arose before mankind, or after, (179)
or it arose with mankind. 180. If they say it arose before mankind,
(181) that *implies*—since, apart from the sacred being, *there* was no
other creator and producer (182) *that* either the sacred being produced
that evil, or it produced its own existence itself, or it was itself
eternal. 183. If they say it arose after mankind, (184) *as to* that,
when human nature is likewise a production of the sacred being, (185)
and the sacred being did not produce evil in the nature of mankind,
(186) how has it sprung into action from them? 187. If the evil *was*
set in action by them, apart from the will of the sacred being, (188)
and a knowledge, as to *their* setting about it, existed *in*

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

the sacred being, (189) that *implies that* the sacred being is
imperfect in his own will, (190) and mankind are victorious and
triumphant in setting aside the will *and* command of the sacred being,
and doing the evil competing *with* the will of the sacred being. 191.
Also the power of the sacred being in his own will and his own servants
is manifestly unprevailing. 192. If they say that he makes them proceed
afterwards to the awful punishment of hell, (193) *as to* that <span
id="fr_873"></span>[1](#fn_865.md), if the sacred being *be* a powerful
doer, *and* not to allow the committal of crime, *but* to convey *it*
away from their minds, *be* more advantageous *and* more adapted to the
compassion of a sacred being than *if* he allowed the committal, (194)
*yet he has* become helplessly contented with it, (195) *and*,
afterwards, contentedly punishes his own creatures, (196) *then*, as to
the one matter I am well considering, either incapability, or scanty
knowledge, or scanty goodness is thereby manifested.

197\. If they say that the sacred being produced and created evil for
the reason that so mankind *may* fully understand the value of goodness,
(198) *as to* that you should observe that, if evil *be* requisite and
advantageous for understanding goodness, that evil exists *by* his good
will. 199. *And* if evil exists *by* his good will, and is requisite
*and* advantageous for him *of* whom they say that evil is not his wish,
*it* is inconsistent.

200\. *As to* that also which they say, that death, pain, *and* poverty
*are* produced by him for the reason that so mankind *may* much better
understand the value of life, health, and opulence, (201) *and* become
more grateful unto the sacred being, (202) *as to* that

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

you should observe that *it* is as *it were* acting unreasonably, in the
mode of him who gives poison to mankind for the sake of increasing the
value *and* price of an antidote, (203) so that he *may* sell the
antidote dearer *and* more costly. 204. To what is this intermeddling
action owing, that, for the sake of an understanding of the value of the
goodness of other *things*, he allows pain, death, *and* misery in some
one else?

205\. Again, *as to* that which a multitude of them say, that the sacred
being is a ruler over every creature and creation, (206) because his
creations are all his own. 207. *And* he acts about them as is desirable
for him, because it is desirable for him, *and he* is not a causer of
distress. 208. Since distress is that which they inflict upon anything
that is not their own, (209) then the who, all things *being* his own,
acts about them as is desirable for him, is not a causer of
distress <span id="fr_874"></span>[1](#fn_866.md). 210. *As to* that you
should know that, if, on account of sovereignty, he who occasions
distress is not to be called a causer of distress, (211) that is *as
though* even he who is a sovereign *and* tells a lie is speaking
truthfully, (212) and he who, on account of sovereignty, commits crime,
sin, theft, *and* plunder is not to be called a sinner. 213. Such as
that which the glorified Rôshan <span id="fr_875"></span>[2](#fn_867.md),
son of Âtûr-frôbag, related as a parable (ângunî-aîtak), (214) that they
saw a man who was defiling an ass, (215) when they enquired of him

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

thus: 'Why dost thou commit this execrable action?' 216. And he spoke
thus, in excuse: 'The ass is my own.'

217\. Again, you should ask this of them, (218) that is: 'Is the sacred
being a friend, or an enemy, to these creatures and creations which are
made by him?' 219. If *he be* a friend of the creatures, that *implies
that* it is not proper for him to desire *and* to produce the evil *and*
misery of the creatures; (220) *yet*, as regards the devastation and
misery of his own achievements, *he has* never even become tired of
them. 221. If *he be* an enemy of the creatures, that *implies that* it
is not proper for him to create *and* produce, through his own competent
knowledge, that thing which is his enemy *and* disablement <span
id="fr_876"></span>[1](#fn_868.md), and struggles against his will.

222\. This, too, you should ask, (223) that is: 'Is the sacred being
always a well-understanding, good sovereign, occasioning
prosperity <span id="fr_877"></span>[2](#fn_869), (224.md) or an
evil-understanding, bad sovereign, occasioning distress? 225. Or is
there a time when *he is* a well-understanding, good sovereign,
occasioning prosperity, (226) and is there a time when *he is* an
evil-understanding, bad sovereign, occasioning distress?'

227\. If *he be* always a well-understanding, good sovereign,
occasioning prosperity, (228) that *implies that* there are not, in his
country *and* sovereignty, *any* oppression, distress, and complaint;
(229) and his affection *for* the creatures and the affection of the
creatures for him are pure. 230. Owing to the

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

same reason *he is* merciful as regards his own creatures, (231) and his
creatures are recounting *his* praise, utterers of thanksgivings *and*
pure friends towards him. 232. His title of divinity, moreover, is
worthily his own.

233\. If *he be* an evil-understanding, bad sovereign, occasioning
distress, (234) that *implies that he is* himself a pure <span
id="fr_878"></span>[1](#fn_870.md) enemy to the creatures, and his
creatures are also *of* a like nature towards him. 235. Owing to the
same reason *he is* an injurer, destroyer, *and* deluder of the
creatures, (236) and his creatures are complainers of him, strugglers
concerning him, *and* pure enemies. 237. His title of divinity,
moreover, is the equivalent of an unworthy name; (238) and, even on
account of his eternity, the creatures are hopeless of becoming free
from the risk of distress and misery for an unlimited time.

239\. If there be a time when *he is* a good sovereign,
well-understanding, *and* occasioning prosperity, and there be a time
when *he* is turned away from this; (240) that *implies that* his
affection for the creatures is mingled. 241. From a mingled affection
*arises* mingled action, (242) *and* from mingled action a mingled
individuality is also manifested. 243. And his creatures also are
mingled friends to him. 244. Of *one's* associates *there* is none who,
if a friend, is not one's enemy, no praiser who is not complaining of
one, no glorifier even who is not scorning one; a character of this
description is manifest among all creatures.

245\. Again, *observe* this, that since all things which are in the
world are not outside of these two terms,

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

good and evil, (246) that *implies*, if good and evil are both said *to
arise* from the sacred being and through the will of the sacred being,
(247) *that* the troublesome Aharman is unreasonably defamed; *that,
being* innocent *and* without an original evolution, he never was, nor
*will* be, evil and headstrong <span id="fr_879"></span>[1](#fn_871.md).
248. That which is mentioned in scripture (nipîk) <span
id="fr_880"></span>[2](#fn_872.md), that Aharman became headstrong, and was
put out of heaven by them, is unreasonable, (249) because even that
headstrongness *and* disobedience *were* likewise through the will of
the sacred being.

250\. If even it be said *that* the good *arises* from the sacred being
and through the will of the sacred being, *and* the evil from mankind,
still Aharman is without an original evolution *and* innocent, and
curses *and* scorn for him are unreasonable. 251. If all this misery and
evil *be* sent down, not from a different nature, but from the
individuality and individual nature of the sacred being himself, (252)
that *implies that* the sacred being is an enemy *and* adversary to his
own tendencies (rûn).

253\. *Observe* this, too, that to speak of the existence of criminality
apart from a nature of crime is very deluding; (254) *and* as *it* is
deluding to imagine a nature of crime that is good, *is it* more
deluding to imagine Aharman—who is the origin *and* original evolution
of every crime—*apart* from the creation and achievement of the sacred
being?

255\. The conclusion is this, that if *at* first there be anything which
is not within the will of the sacred being, provided everything be
through the will of the sacred being, no one whatever is a sinner; (256)

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

and the apostle <span id="fr_881"></span>[1](#fn_873.md) and religion
*were* appointed without a purpose. 257. If it be expedient to ruin any
one for sinfulness, it is more expedient to ruin him who is the original
doer, maintainer, and creator of every evil and crime. 258. And if it be
said *that* evil and crime *arise* from Aharman or mankind, that
*implies*, as they are likewise created and produced *by* the sacred
being, *that* he is the source of them; in like manner, he who is the
cause of the origin of evil (259) is worse than evil.

260\. This, too, you should observe, that sects (kêshân) of every kind
assert this *maxim*, handed down by their own high-priests, when *it* is
mentioned and prescribed by them to their own congregation (ram), that
is: 'Perform good works *and* abstain from crime.' 261. On account of
delusion they do not consider this, that is, from where and what origin
ought the crime to arise, about which *it* is thus commanded: 'Ye shall
not commit *it, and* I *will* cast *him* who commits *it* into eternal
hell.' 262. So that, if *that* same *be* owing to the sacred being, it
would be easier for him not to produce it, than, after *its* production,
*to have* brought *it* to notice and commanded *us* to abstain from it.
263. So far, indeed, I do not understand any advantage and motive *in*
the production and creation of evil.

264\. Again, in their scriptures, he speaks inconsistently about good
works and crime (265) thus: 'Good works and crime are both owing to me.
266. Neither demons, nor wizards, are unrestricted in causing the ruin
of any one. 267. No one *has* accepted the religion *and* done good
works, and no one *has* walked in infidelity *and* committed crime,
except through my will.'

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 268. In the same
scripture he adduces many *things* which *one has* to connect, and
inflicts curses on the creatures, (269) thus: 'Why do mankind desire
*and* commit that crime which I design for them?' 270. It occurs
concerning the will and work of his own hand, and *yet* he frightens
them with punishment in body and soul. 271. *In* another place he speaks
thus: 'I myself am the deluder of mankind, for if it should be my will
they *would* then be shown the true path by me, but *it is* my will that
they go to hell <span id="fr_882"></span>[1](#fn_874.md).' 272. And *in*
another place he speaks thus: 'Man himself is the causer of crime.'

273\. In these three modes the sacred being gives evidence of different
kinds about his own creatures. 274. One is this, that *he* himself is
Aharman <span id="fr_883"></span>[2](#fn_875); (275.md) one is this, that
he is himself the deluder of the creatures <span
id="fr_884"></span>[3](#fn_876); (276.md) *and*, in the other, he makes his
own creatures confederates involved with Aharman in deluding <span
id="fr_885"></span>[4](#fn_877.md); so that *he implies:* 'There are
*instances* when I occasion *it, and* there are *instances* when Aharman
*does*.'

277\. Through that *which* he states, that mankind themselves occasion
crime, they are made by him confederates with Aharman; *he* himself
*being* at a distance from the crime. 278. For if mankind commit crime
owing to their own nature and their own delusion, that *implies that*
the sacred being, with

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Aharman, is far
from the criminality, (279) because *it is* as *it were* not owing to
the sacred being, nor yet owing to Aharman.

280\. Again, you should ask of those whom they call Mûtazalîk <span
id="fr_886"></span>[1](#fn_878) (281.md) thus: 'Is *it* the will of the
sacred being *for* all mankind to abstain from crime through *their own*
free will <span id="fr_887"></span>[2](#fn_879.md), to escape from hell,
*and* to make *them* proceed to heaven, or not?' 282. If *one* says that
*it is* not, (283) that *implies that* an <span
id="fr_888"></span>[3](#fn_880.md) opinion is formed by him as to the
little goodness of the sacred being *and* the evil of his will; (284)
*and*, for the same reason, *it* is not fitting to glorify *him* as the
divine existence. 285. If *one* says that *it is* his will, (286) that
*implies that* an opinion is formed by him as to the good will of the
sacred being; (287) *and*, for the same reason, *it* is fitting to
glorify *him* as the divine existence.

288\. *Ask* this, too, that is: 'If *it be* his will, is *he* capable of
performing *it*, or not?' 289. If *one* says that *he is* not, (290)
that *implies that* an opinion is formed by him as to the incapability
of the sacred being as regards that will of his; (291) *and*, for the
same reason, *it* is not fitting to glorify *him* as the divine
existence which is almighty. 292. If *one* says that *he* is capable of
performing *his* will, (293) that *implies that* an opinion is formed by
him as to *his*

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

capability for that will of his; (294) *and*, for the same reason, *it*
is fitting to glorify *him* as the divine existence which is almighty.

295\. Again, *ask* this, that is: 'When *he* is capable of performing
his will, does he perform *it*, or not?' 296. If *one* says that he
performs *it*, (297) that *implies that* the abstaining from sin,
escaping from hell, and bringing to heaven <span
id="fr_889"></span>[1](#fn_881.md) would be manifested unto all mankind;
(298) *but* this is that which is not manifest by his existence, and is
falsifying even his own revelation (dînŏ). 299. If *one* says that *he*
is capable of performing his will, but does not perform *it*, (300) that
*implies that* an opinion is formed by him as to the unmercifulness of
the sacred being, *his* enmity to mankind, and the inconstancy of his
will. 301. For if he performs *it, it* is no harm to him himself and is
an advantage *to* mankind; his own will is also continuous thereby. 302.
*But* if he does not perform *it, it* is no advantage to him himself
and, is harm *to* mankind; his own will is also discontinuous thereby.

303\. Again, *ask* this, that is: 'Does he not perform *it* through
will, or without will?' 304. If *one* says that he does not perform *it*
through will, (305) that *implies that* an opinion is formed by him that
the sacred being is good-willed, *but* has no will to do good; (306)
*and* this is even to consider *him* faulty through inconsistency. 307.
If *one* says that *he* is without will, *and* therefore does not
perform *it*, (308) *that implies* that an opinion is formed by him as
to the weakness of the sacred being in his own self, or the existence of
an injurer of his will.

309\. The conclusion is this, that, *with* a manager

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

of this worldly *existence* who may be without an opponent, without
competition, and perfect in sagacity, goodness, and capability, *there*
should not be all these unworthy actions, trouble and misery, pain and
vexation, especially of mankind and the other creatures. 310. Because,
when a manager, without an opponent, is perfect in sagacity, he knows
means for evil not to occur and also remedies for carrying off evil.
311. When *he* is perfect in goodness and merciful, *he has* no wish for
the occurrence of evil at first, *but* a wish for *its* extinction. 312.
When *he* is perfect in capability, *he* is capable of not really
becoming equally the origin of evil.

313\. Now, as in the worldly *existence*, whose manager is the sacred
being, the existence of evil is unquestionably visible, then thus much
is not separable from this, either where the manager is *provided* with
an opponent, or is without an opponent:—314. If he does not know means
for evil not to occur, and remedies for carrying off evil, the imperfect
sagacity of the sacred being is thereby <span
id="fr_890"></span>[1](#fn_882.md) manifested. 315. Or the evil exists
*with* his good will, *and* the imperfect goodness of his will is
manifested. 316. Or *he* is not capable of not *allowing* the occurrence
of evil, and of carrying *it* off, *and* the imperfect capability of the
sacred being is manifested. 317. And when *he* is imperfect even *in*
one—in sagacity, or goodness, or capability—*it* is not fitting to
glorify *and* worship *him* as the divine existence who is almighty,
all-good, *and* all-wise.

318\. This, too, you should know, that since any existing thing, which
is acting, is *provided* with a will, but *its* nature *has* not become
unrestricted, (319) that

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

*shows that*, if the original existence of the creator *be* divinity,
and his nature *be* light *and* beauty, fragrance and purity, goodness
and sagacity, then such *things* as darkness and ugliness, stench *and*
pollution, vileness *and* ignorance—the demoniacal nature itself—ought
to be far from him. 320. If his original existence *be* anything
demoniacal, and his nature *be* darkness *or* stench, ugliness *or*
pollution, vileness *or* ignorance, then the nature of divinity remains
strange to him.

321\. If there be *any* one by whom indecision about all this is
insinuated into his own self, that *implies that*, owing to his
indecision about it, there is no discrimination *in* him as to goodness,
amid his own evil. 322. Now, moreover, the hope of the hopeful is
absorbed, (323) for even he who goes to heaven through doing good works
is, even there, in evil and misery, (324) because there is no distinct
discrimination of good from evil, even there, (325) if there be the
goodness which is devoid of evil, *and* there be also the evil which is
devoid of goodness, represented *as* really of the same origin. 326.
This is known, that the difference of good and evil is owing to
difference of nature. 327. When the two origins of their difference and
distinction from the other of different nature are manifest, that hope
of the hopeful is just, (328) and sagacity is their passport (parvânak).

329\. This, too, you should know, that every statement which is not
unconfused by its own limits is unenquiring (apa*d*-khvâh) <span
id="fr_891"></span>[1](#fn_883.md). 330. Likewise this, that the limit of
divinity is specially sagacity. 331. *And* also this, that <span
id="fr_892"></span>[2](#fn_884.md) the limit of sagacity is only <span
id="fr_893"></span>[3](#fn_885.md)

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

advantageous action. 332. Advantageous action is not doing injury; (333)
*and* the modes of doing injury are three. 334. One is that which,
*being* no advantage to oneself, is the injury of another also. 335.
\[One is that which, *being* no advantage to another <span
id="fr_894"></span>[1](#fn_886.md)\], is the injury of oneself also. 336.
*And* one is that which is the injury of oneself and the injury of
another also. 337. And from the creation of Aharman and the demons
*there* is no advantage *to* a wisely-acting sacred being himself, *and
there is* injury of others also; (338) the non-advancement of even his
own will, owing to his own work, is always manifested thereby.

339\. This, too, *you should know*, that if the will of the sacred being
*be* goodness, (340) his will is also eternal. 341. And he should be
capable of a suitable will, (342) so that, from the beginning even to
the end, all the goodness *and* virtue of the will of the sacred being
would have proceeded in the world. 343. Now *it* is manifest that
vileness and vice always proceed much more. 344. Therefore *the cause*
is one of these, either they always proceed through the will of the
sacred being, or without *his* will. 345. If they always proceed through
some will of the sacred being, *it* is evident that his will is also for
vileness as well as for goodness, (346) or *he* is inefficient and
changeable in will. 347. Since a will does not change, unless owing to a
cause, or unless owing to a changer, (348) that *implies* one of these
two, either *it* is through some cause, or there exists some other
*being with* him as a changer of his will. 349 If they always proceed
not through the will of the sacred being, (350) *from* that *it* is
evident that the

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

sacred being is suffering in his own will, and his will is not perfect,
(351) or there exists some diminisher of it who is a possessor *of*
will.

352\. *As to* this, too, which they assert, that the sacred being
commanded Adam thus: 'Thou shalt not eat of this one tree which is in
paradise (vahi*s*t) <span id="fr_895"></span>[1](#fn_887),' (353.md) you
should ask of them (354) thus: 'Was the command which the sacred being
gave to Adam, thus: "You shall not eat of this tree," good or evil?'
355. If the command were good *it* is evident that the tree was evil;
(356) *and* it is not befitting the sacred being to create anything that
is evil. 357. If the tree were good the command was evil, *and* it is
not befitting the sacred being to give an evil command. 358. If the tree
were good, and the command as to not eating *were* given by him, it is
not <span id="fr_896"></span>[2](#fn_888.md) adapted to the goodness and
mercifulness of the sacred being to allot a benefit *away* from his own
innocent servants.

359\. *As to* this, too, which they assert, that the sacred being brings
every one whom he wills unto faith and the true way, and, as the
recompense, he makes him proceed to the happy progress which is eternal;
(360) *and* him whom he does not will he leaves in irreligion and
ignorance of the sacred being, and, for that reason, he casts him into
hell and eternal misery <span id="fr_897"></span>[3](#fn_889); (361.md) you
should ask of them (362) thus: 'Is he good whose desire and will are for
the religion and faith of the sacred being and the true way, or he whose
desire and will are for going astray, irreligion, and ignorance of the
sacred being?' 363. If *one* says that he is good whose desire and will

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

are for the religion of the sacred being and the true way, (364) now *as
to* that man about whom this is the will of the sacred being, that he
*shall* leave him in irreligion, going astray, and ignorance of the
sacred being, *and to whom* an apostle, or *some* other person who is a
friend, recites the revelation (dînô) of the sacred being and the true
way, (365) *does* that *show that* the sacred being is thereby better
and more beneficial to him, or are that apostle *and* that person *so?*
366. If *one* says that the will of the sacred being about him <span
id="fr_898"></span>[1](#fn_890.md) is good, it is thereby asserted by him,
that not understanding the sacred being, not accepting the religion, and
going astray are good; *but* this is not acceptable \[and not to be
taught <span id="fr_899"></span>[2](#fn_891.md)\], on account of error.
367. If *one* says that his coming to the true religion and
understanding the sacred being are thereby better and more beneficial,
(368) it is thereby obviously asserted by one that the apostle and
person are thereby better to him than the sacred being. 369. Because a
person *through* whom the true way and an understanding of the sacred
being are wanted among mankind, and his will is *bent* upon it, is much
better than he who is a sacred being (370) *by* whose will backsliding
(a*v*â*z*râsîh), misunderstanding, and irreligion *exist* among them;
*and* the sacred being is much worse than that person.

371\. *Observe* this, too, that if the criminal thought and criminal
action of man are by the will of the sacred being, that already
*implies* that the sacred being produced criminal thought, and sowed
crime

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

in his mind, (372) and Aharman merely invites and instigates him to the
committal of crime; that *shows that* the criminal thought *traced to*
the sacred being and also his desire for it are more violent and worse
than the invitation of Aharman. 373. When, too, his listening to *what
proceeds* from Aharman, *as to* the committal of crime, is likewise due
to the criminal thought which the sacred being produced, and *so* also
*is* his desire for it, *it* is already obvious that the sacred being is
much worse and more sinful than Aharman.

374\. As regards these statements, which are enumerated by us, (375) one
of these two *opinions* must arise, (376) either that all are true or
that all are false, (377) or there are *some* which are true and there
are *some* which are false. 378. If all *be* true, every statement that
is not adapted to these statements is false, *or* something *of* the
two, truth and falsehood. 379. If all *be* false, every statement that
is not adapted to these statements is true, *or* something *of* the two
together <span id="fr_900"></span>[1](#fn_892.md). 380. If there be *some*
that are true and there be *some* that are false, (381) then of those
which are true—*derived* from the nature and nucleus (nâf) of
truth—(382) and of those which are false—*derived* from the nature and
nucleus and original evolution of falsehood—(383) the origins are two,
one from which *arises* truth, *and* one *from* which *arises*
falsehood.

but, as the two Pâz. verbs end in -u*n*, the original Pahlavi
termination may have been -yên (3d pers. optative). and we might read
'which every one may, as it were, observe.'

<span id="fn_833"></span>[175:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_841.md) K28 inserts
shâya*d*, '*and* possible,' and JE inserts Pâz. tvã, which has the same
meaning; but these insertions have probably originated in a blunder of
the writer of AK, who first wrote Sans. *s*aknoti, the usual equivalent
of Pâz. shâya*d*, but afterwards interlined Sans. sa*m*yu*g*yate to
correspond with sa*z*e*d*, 'it is expedient,' the word he had written in
the Pâz. text.

<span id="fn_834"></span>[176:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_842.md) Assuming that Pâz.
*k*i, 'what?' stands for *k*im. Sans. has 'how?' (Pâz. *k*u*n*.)

<span id="fn_835"></span>[176:2](sbe24081.htm#fr_843.md) 'Yet the Lord hath
not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear,
unto this day' (Deut. xxix. 4).

<span id="fn_836"></span>[177:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_844.md) Assuming that Pâz.
khvazâr stands for khû*g*ârak; but, as Sans. has 'injury,' the Pâzand
may be a misreading of â*z*âr.

<span id="fn_837"></span>[177:2](sbe24081.htm#fr_845.md) Referring probably
to the fall of man, detailed in §§ 61-77.

<span id="fn_838"></span>[177:3](sbe24081.htm#fr_846.md) So in Sans. and
JE, as in § 51; but AK and MH19 have 'go' here.

<span id="fn_839"></span>[178:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_847.md) 'And we did create
man from crackling clay of black mud wrought in form. And the *g*inns
had we created before of smokeless fire. And when thy lord said to the
angels, "Verily I am creating a mortal from crackling clay of black mud
wrought into shape; and when I have fashioned it, and breathed into it
of my spirit, then fall ye down before it adoring." And the angels
adored all of them together, save Iblîs, who refused to be among those
who adored. . . . He said, "Then get thee forth." . . . Said he, "O my
lord! respite me until the day when they shall be raised." He said,
"Then, verily, thou art of the respited." . . . He said, "O my lord! for
that thou hast seduced me I will surely make it seem seemly for them on
earth, and I will surely seduce them all together, save such of thy
servants amongst them as are sincere."' (Qur’ân XV, 26-40; SBE, vol.
vi.)

<span id="fn_840"></span>[179:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_848.md) 'And the Lord God
took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it and to
keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of
the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it "' (Gen. ii. 15-17).

<span id="fn_841"></span>[179:2](sbe24081.htm#fr_849.md) 'Now the serpent
was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made'
(Gen. iii. 1).

<span id="fn_842"></span>[179:3](sbe24081.htm#fr_850.md) 'That old serpent,
called the Devil and Satan' (Rev. xii. 9, xx. 2).

<span id="fn_843"></span>[179:4](sbe24081.htm#fr_851.md) Compare Gen. iii.
1-6.

<span id="fn_844"></span>[179:5](sbe24081.htm#fr_852.md) 'And the eyes of
them both were opened' (Gen. iii. 7):

<span id="fn_845"></span>[179:6](sbe24081.htm#fr_853.md) 'Therefore the
Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from
whence he was taken. So he drove out the man' (Gen. iii. 23, 24).

<span id="fn_846"></span>[180:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_854.md) 'For the Lord will
not forsake his people for his great name's sake; because it hath
pleased the Lord to make you his people . . . but I (Samuel) will teach
you the good and the right way' (1 Sam. xii. 22, 23).

<span id="fn_847"></span>[180:2](sbe24081.htm#fr_855.md) 'I will send them
prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute'
(Luke xi. 49).

<span id="fn_848"></span>[181:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_856.md) The will of the
adversary is probably meant (see § 95).

<span id="fn_849"></span>[181:2](sbe24081.htm#fr_857.md) So in Sans. and
JE, but AK has 'so that.'

<span id="fn_850"></span>[182:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_858.md) That is, why is
the sinner punished while the adversary, who occasions the sin, remains
unmolested and triumphant?

<span id="fn_851"></span>[182:2](sbe24081.htm#fr_859.md) AK has 'let'
written above 'admitted.'

<span id="fn_852"></span>[183:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_860.md) Pâz. khôr, which
Nêr. seems to have identified with Pers. kar, as his Sans. gives 'deaf.'
It may, however, mean 'blind' (Pers. kûr), as in Chap. XII, 64, 70.

<span id="fn_853"></span>[183:2](sbe24081.htm#fr_861.md) The Sanskrit takes
Pâz. dastûr in its more usual sense of 'high-priest.'

<span id="fn_854"></span>[184:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_862.md) Sans. has 'the
will of the sacred being *being* powerful and eternal.'

<span id="fn_855"></span>[184:2](sbe24081.htm#fr_863.md) Without whose will
and command the sin and evil cannot arise, as assumed in § 125.

<span id="fn_856"></span>[184:3](sbe24081.htm#fr_864.md) The sick are
probably meant, but the original text is ambiguous.

<span id="fn_857"></span>[184:4](sbe24081.htm#fr_865.md) Assuming that Pâz.
hugâre*n*d stands for Pahl. aûkâlend.

<span id="fn_858"></span>[185:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_866.md) Probably the poor,
but the original text is ambiguous.

<span id="fn_859"></span>[185:2](sbe24081.htm#fr_867.md) Assuming that Pâz.
*g*âmine*d* stands for Pahl. gâmînê*d*. The old MS. AK ends with this
section, and the remaining half of the extant text has been found only
in modern copies, having been formerly separated from AK and lost

<span id="fn_860"></span>[185:3](sbe24081.htm#fr_868.md) So in JE, but JJ
has 'nobility,' and MH19 has 'pleasure.'

<span id="fn_861"></span>[185:4](sbe24081.htm#fr_869.md) JJ has 'nobility.'

<span id="fn_862"></span>[186:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_870.md) Assuming that Pâz.
ham*e*khtaa stands for Pahl. âmîkhtak.

<span id="fn_863"></span>[186:2](sbe24081.htm#fr_871.md) Compare Chap.
VIII, 108-116.

<span id="fn_864"></span>[186:3](sbe24081.htm#fr_872.md) That is,
'instinctively.'

<span id="fn_865"></span>[188:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_873.md) So in MH19 and
Sans., but JE omits 'that.'

<span id="fn_866"></span>[189:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_874.md) Compare Rom. ix.
20, 21: 'Shall the thing formed say to him that formed *it*, "Why hast
thou made me thus?" Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same
lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour?'

<span id="fn_867"></span>[189:2](sbe24081.htm#fr_875.md) See Chap. X, 53.

<span id="fn_868"></span>[190:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_876.md) Assuming that Pâz.
apa*d*vâh stands for Pahl. apatûgîh; the two words being nearly alike in
Pahlavi letters.

<span id="fn_869"></span>[190:2](sbe24081.htm#fr_877.md) Reading
â*v*â*d*îh-kar instead of Pâz. â*z*âdîgar, 'producing freedom, or
nobility,' which two words are alike in Pahlavi writing.

<span id="fn_870"></span>[191:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_878.md) The word
a*v*ê*z*ak, 'pure,' is here used idiomatically for 'mere,' precisely as
'pure' is often used in English.

<span id="fn_871"></span>[192:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_879.md) Literally 'with
averted head.'

<span id="fn_872"></span>[192:2](sbe24081.htm#fr_880.md) Probably referring
to the Qur’ân XV, 26-40 (see § 59 n).

<span id="fn_873"></span>[193:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_881.md) Zaratû*s*t.

<span id="fn_874"></span>[194:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_882.md) Texts to this
effect are numerous in the Qur’ân, such as 'whom he pleases does God
lead astray, and whom he pleases he places on the right way . . . God
leads the wrong-doers astray; for God does what he will . . . in hell
they shall broil' (Qur’ân VI, 39, XIV, 32, 34; SBE, vol. vi).

<span id="fn_875"></span>[194:2](sbe24081.htm#fr_883.md) As deduced from
the passage quoted in § 269.

<span id="fn_876"></span>[194:3](sbe24081.htm#fr_884.md) As stated in the
passage quoted in § 272.

<span id="fn_877"></span>[194:4](sbe24081.htm#fr_885.md) As implied in the
passage quoted in § 272.

<span id="fn_878"></span>[195:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_886.md) Which is doubtless
the original Pahlavi form of Pâz. muthzarî. It is an adjective, meaning
'seceding, schismatic,' derived from Ar. mu’htazil, and applied
specially to Muhammadan schismatics.

<span id="fn_879"></span>[195:2](sbe24081.htm#fr_887.md) Assuming that Pâz.
âwâ*d*-kâmî stands for Pahl. a*z*â*d*-kâmîh, which would be identical
with the former word in Pahlavi writing.

<span id="fn_880"></span>[195:3](sbe24081.htm#fr_888.md) JE has 'no' in
Pâz. but not in Sans., which negative is evidently a modern blunder.

<span id="fn_881"></span>[196:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_889.md) JJ has 'saving
from hell *and* escaping to heaven.'

<span id="fn_882"></span>[197:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_890.md) Reading a*g*a*s*
instead of the similarly-written afa*s*, 'and by it.'

<span id="fn_883"></span>[198:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_891.md) Sans. has
'undesirable.'

<span id="fn_884"></span>[198:2](sbe24081.htm#fr_892.md) JJ and Sans. omit
these four words.

<span id="fn_885"></span>[198:3](sbe24081.htm#fr_893.md) Literally 'one.'

<span id="fn_886"></span>[199:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_894.md) The words in
brackets are omitted, both in Pâz. and Sans., by JE and JJ, the only two
MSS. available.

<span id="fn_887"></span>[200:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_895.md) See § 64.

<span id="fn_888"></span>[200:2](sbe24081.htm#fr_896.md) Reading Pâz. n*e*
instead of Pâz. b*e*, 'quite,' as the Sanskrit has a negative
participle.

<span id="fn_889"></span>[200:3](sbe24081.htm#fr_897.md) See § 271.

<span id="fn_890"></span>[201:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_898.md) The man mentioned
in § 364.

<span id="fn_891"></span>[201:2](sbe24081.htm#fr_899.md) The words in
brackets have no equivalent in the Pâzand text, but are indicated by
âsvâdya*ñk*a in Sans.

<span id="fn_892"></span>[202:1](sbe24081.htm#fr_900.md) Sans. has
'something mingled twofold.'
