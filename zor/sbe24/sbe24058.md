### CHAPTER LII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'How is it necessary
to perform the ceremonial of the sacred beings and the thanksgiving for
the welfare which is owing to the sacred beings? 3. *And* how is the
renunciation *of sin* to be performed for the preservation of the soul?'

4\. The spirit of wisdom answered (5) thus: 'That ceremonial of the
sacred beings is good which they perform in this pure, good religion of
the Ma*zd*a-worshippers. 6. Its origin, also, is goodness and truth, and
freedom from doubt in the sacred beings. 7. And for the little and the
much that has come *there has* arisen thanksgiving unto the sacred
beings; and *one* is to meditate upon the gratifications (shnûmakân) and
prosperity which are owing to the, sacred beings and to keep
grateful <span id="fr_499"></span>[2](#fn_493.md). 8. And even when
perplexity and misery come on from Aharman and the demons, *he* is not
to become doubtful as to the treasure of the sacred beings, (9) and not
to diminish the thanksgiving unto the sacred beings. 10. And every
disaster which springs up *he* is to give back <span
id="fr_500"></span>[3](#fn_494.md) to the violence of Aharman and the
demons. 11. *He* is not to seek his own welfare and advantage through
the injury of any one else; (12) and he

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

becomes compassionate as regards the creatures of Aûha*r*ma*zd*. 13. In
duty and good works *he* is diligent and striving <span
id="fr_501"></span>[1](#fn_495); (14.md) *and* especially in the care of
water and fire <span id="fr_502"></span>[2](#fn_496.md) *he* is to
persevere much. 15. And *he* is to be without doubt as to this, that,
except happiness, the sacred beings do not then <span
id="fr_503"></span>[3](#fn_497.md) give anything whatever, *as* a
modification <span id="fr_504"></span>[4](#fn_498.md) of it, unto men; and
Aharman and the demons, except misery, do not then <span
id="fr_505"></span>[3](#fn_497.md) give them any happiness.

16\. 'For the existence of renunciation *of sin* the special thing is
this, that *one* commits no sin voluntarily; (17) and if, through folly,
or weakness and ignorance, a sin occurs, he is then in renunciation *of
sin* before the high-priests and the good. 18. And after that,
*when* <span id="fr_506"></span>[5](#fn_499.md) he does not commit it, then
that sin which is committed by him becomes thus a sweeping
(êsvârakŏ) <span id="fr_507"></span>[6](#fn_500) from his body; (19.md)
just as the wind which is hasty and mighty, when it comes swift and
strong, sweeps so over the plain that it carries away every single blade
of grass (gîyyâkî*k*akŏ-1) and anything which is broken *in* that
place.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_493"></span>[94:2](sbe24058.htm#fr_499.md) The Pâzand version
omits the latter half of this section, and also uses the present tense
instead of the infinitive in several of the following sections.

<span id="fn_494"></span>[94:3](sbe24058.htm#fr_500.md) Perhaps 'trace
back' may be meant, but this is uncertain.

<span id="fn_495"></span>[95:1](sbe24058.htm#fr_501.md) L19 has 'he acts
diligently and strivingly.'

<span id="fn_496"></span>[95:2](sbe24058.htm#fr_502.md) L19 adds 'and
plants.'

<span id="fn_497"></span>[95:3](sbe24058.htm#fr_505.md) Reading êdîna*s*;
Nêr. has misread ainâ, 'otherwise.'

<span id="fn_498"></span>[95:4](sbe24058.htm#fr_504.md) Reading gvî*d*arîh;
Nêr. has misread vatarî, 'an evil.'

<span id="fn_499"></span>[95:5](sbe24058.htm#fr_506.md) L19 has 'too,' and
K43 omits the word.

<span id="fn_500"></span>[95:6](sbe24058.htm#fr_507.md) Misread a*v*â*z*,
'away,' by Nêryôsang.
