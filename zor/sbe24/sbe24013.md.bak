### CHAPTER VII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'How is heaven, and
how many? 3. How are the ever-stationary (hamîstân), and how many? 4.
And how is hell, and how many? 5. What is the decision *about* the
righteous in heaven, and from what is *their* happiness? 6. What are the
misery and affliction of the wicked in hell? 7. And what and how is the
decision *about* those who are among the ever-stationary?'

8\. The spirit of wisdom answered (9) thus: 'Heaven is, first, from the
star station unto the

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

moon station; (10) second, from the moon station unto the sun; (11)
*and*, third, from the sun station unto the supreme heaven
(garô*d*mânô), whereon the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd* is seated. 12. Of
heaven the first *part* is *that of* good thoughts (hûmatô), the second
is *that of* good words (hûkhtô), and the third is that of good deeds
(hûvar*s*tô).

13\. 'The righteous in heaven are undecaying and immortal, unalarmed,
undistressed, and undisturbed. 14. And, everywhere <span
id="fr_177"></span>[1](#fn_175.md), they are full of glory, fragrant, and
joyful, full of delight and full of happiness. 15. And, *at* all times,
a fragrant breeze and a scent which is like sweet basil come to meet
*them*, which are more pleasant than every pleasure, and more fragrant
than every fragrance. 16. For them, also, there is no satiety owing to
the existence in heaven. 17. And their sitting and walking, perception
and enjoyment are with the angels and archangels and the righteous for
ever and everlasting.

18\. 'Regarding the ever-stationary *it* is declared, that *they are*
from the earth unto the star station; (19) and its affliction for them
is then <span id="fr_178"></span>[2](#fn_176.md) nothing whatever except
cold and heat.

20\. 'Of hell the *first* part is *that of* evil thoughts
(dû*s*-hûmatô), the second is *that of* evil words (dû*s*-hûkhtô), and
the third is *that of* evil deeds

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
(dû*s*-hûvar*s*tô) <span id="fr_179"></span>[1](#fn_177.md). 21. *With* the
fourth step the wicked person arrives at that which is the darkest hell;
(22) and they lead him forwards to the vicinity of Aharman, the wicked.
23. And Aharman and the demons, thereupon, make ridicule and mockery of
him (24) thus <span id="fr_180"></span>[2](#fn_178.md): "What was thy
trouble and complaint, as regards Aûha*r*ma*zd* and the archangels, and
the fragrant and joyful heaven, when thou approachedst for a sight of us
and gloomy hell, (25) although we cause thee misery therein and do not
pity, and thou shalt see misery of long duration?" 26. And, afterwards,
they execute punishment and torment of various kinds upon him.

27\. 'There is a place <span id="fr_181"></span>[3](#fn_179.md) where, as
to cold, *it* is such as that of the coldest frozen <span
id="fr_182"></span>[4](#fn_180.md) snow. 28. There is a place where, as to
heat, *it* is such as that of the hottest and most blazing fire. 29.
There is a place where noxious creatures are gnawing them, just as a dog
*does* the bones. 30. There is a place where, as to stench, *it* is such
that they stagger about (ba*r*â lar*z*ênd) <span
id="fr_183"></span>[5](#fn_181.md) *and* fall down. 31. And the darkness

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

is always such-like as though it is possible for them to seize upon *it*
with the hand <span id="fr_184"></span>[1](#fn_182.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_175"></span>[30:1](sbe24013.htm#fr_177.md) Nêr. has 'at all
times,' which may be correct, as gâs means both 'time' and 'place.' It
should be noticed, however, that the word used in § 15 is damân, which
means 'time' only.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[30:2](sbe24013.htm#fr_178.md) Nêr. has 'their
affliction is otherwise,' by mistaking Huz. adîna*s*-*s*ân, 'then its .
. . for them,' for a supposed Pâz. ainâ*s*ã, 'otherwise their,' which
seems to have no real existence, as wherever he reads ainâ, 'otherwise,'
the Pahl. text has adîna*s*, 'then its.'

<span id="fn_177"></span>[31:1](sbe24013.htm#fr_179.md) These names, as
here written, mean literally 'evil good thoughts, evil good words, and
evil good deeds,' as if they implied that these places are for those
whose best thoughts, words, and deeds are evil; but it is not quite
certain that the Pahlavi names are spelt correctly.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[31:2](sbe24013.htm#fr_180.md) As already stated
in Chap. II, 183-186.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[31:3](sbe24013.htm#fr_181.md) L19 has 'he is
experienced' in §§ 27-30, owing to Nêr. having read dânâk, 'knowing,
experienced,' instead of dîvâk, 'a place.'

<span id="fn_180"></span>[31:4](sbe24013.htm#fr_182.md) Literally,
'stone-possessing, stony' if we read sang-dâr, as seems most plausible;
but we might read sôkhâr and consider Pers. khasâr or khasar, 'ice,' as
a corruption of it, by transposition. L19 has 'ice (yah) and snow.'

<span id="fn_181"></span>[31:5](sbe24013.htm#fr_183.md) L19 has b*e*
r*ez*e*n*d, 'they vomit up,' which is evidently a misreading.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[32:1](sbe24013.htm#fr_184.md) 'Even darkness
*which* may be felt' (Ex. x. 21).
