### CHAPTER XC.

1\. The ninetieth subject is this, that it is not proper that they
*should* give anything to a sinful person *or one* worthy of death,
because <span id="fr_1554"></span>[1](#fn_1543) it is like that they
have placed in the jaws of a destructive serpent (a*z*dahâ). 2. And, if
this be food which he devours *and* they give, they pass into the
committing of sin; *and* that person *who* may have given food to him is
a participater with him. 3. In eating food, if *there* be no danger and
fear of them <span id="fr_1555"></span>[2](#fn_1544), it is not
desirable to give anything to them, for it would be a great sin.
