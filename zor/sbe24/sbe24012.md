### CHAPTER VI.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Which land is the
unhappier <span id="fr_172"></span>[2](#fn_170)?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'That land is the more
afflicted, in which hell is formed <span
id="fr_173"></span>[3](#fn_171). 5. The second, when they slay in it a
righteous man who is innocent. 6. The third, for whose sake <span
id="fr_174"></span>[4](#fn_172)

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

the demons and fiends work. 7. The fourth, in which they construct an
idol-temple. 8. The fifth, when a wicked man, who is an evil-doer, makes
an abode in it. 9. The sixth, when the interment of a corpse is
performed below <span id="fr_175"></span>[1](#fn_173). 10. The seventh,
in which a noxious creature has a burrow. 11. The eighth, when from the
possession of the good it comes into the possession of the bad. 12. The
ninth, when they make desolate that which was populous. 13. *And* the
tenth, in which they make lamentation and weeping <span
id="fr_176"></span>[2](#fn_174).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_170"></span>[28:2](sbe24012.htm#fr_172) This chapter is an
imitation of Vend. III, 22-37, where it is stated that the five most
unpleasing spots on the earth are, first, the ridge of Arezûra, on which
the demons congregate from the pit of the fiend; second, where most dead
dogs and men lie buried; third, where most depositories for the dead are
constructed; fourth, where there are most burrows of the creatures of
the evil spirit; and fifth, where the family of a righteous man is
driven into captivity.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[28:3](sbe24012.htm#fr_173) Bd. III, 27 states
that 'hell is in the middle of the earth.'

<span id="fn_172"></span>[28:4](sbe24012.htm#fr_174) Reading mûn . . .
rûnŏ-î pa*d*a*s*. Instead of drû*g*ân rânŏ, <span id="page_29">p.
29</span> Nêr. has read drû*g* hanrûnŏ, and assumed the last word to be
equivalent to Av. ha*n*dvarena, 'concourse;' so as to obtain the
meaning, 'in which the demons and the fiend form a congress.' But Av.
ha*n*dvarena is Pahl. ham-dûbâri*s*nîh (see Pahl. Vend. VII, 237).

<span id="fn_173"></span>[29:1](sbe24012.htm#fr_175) Or 'when much
interment of corpses is performed,' as it is doubtful whether we ought
to read a*v*îr, 'much,' or a*z*îr, 'below.'

<span id="fn_174"></span>[29:2](sbe24012.htm#fr_176) That is, for the
dead. Such outward manifestations of mourning being considered sinful by
the Parsis, as they ought to be by all unselfish people who believe in a
future existence of happiness.
