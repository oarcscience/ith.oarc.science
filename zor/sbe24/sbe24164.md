### CHAPTER LXXVI.

1\. The seventy-sixth subject is this, when a woman brings forth, it is
necessary that she *should* not wash *her* head *for* twenty-one days,
nor put *her* hand again on anything, nor walk on a terrace-roof, nor
put *her* foot on a threshold in *her* habitation. 2. And after the
twenty-one days, if she sees herself *in* such a state that she is able
to wash *her* head, she washes *her* head. 3. And, after that, until the
coming on of the fortieth day, it is requisite to abstain from the
vicinity of a fire and anything that is wooden <span
id="fr_1485"></span>[3](#fn_1474.md) *or* earthen; it is also requisite to
abstain from everything of her cooking and pot-boiling <span
id="fr_1486"></span>[4](#fn_1475.md). 4. Afterwards, when it is forty days,
*she is*

to wash *her* head, and it is proper *for her* to do every *kind of*
work.

5\. Till the lapse of a second <span
id="fr_1487"></span>[1](sbe24165.htm#fn_1476.md) forty days it is not
proper *for her* husband to make an approach to her, for it is a great
sin, and it is possible that she *may* become pregnant a second time, as
within a *period of* forty days women become very quickly pregnant <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[2](sbe24165.htm#fn_1477.md).

6\. And if after the *first* forty days she sees herself impure, unless
she knows with accuracy that it has come from the infant, it is
necessary to consider if *she be* menstruous.
