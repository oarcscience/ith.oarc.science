### CHAPTER II.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'How is it possible to
seek the maintenance and prosperity of the body \[without injury of the
soul, and the preservation of the soul without injury of the body <span
id="fr_65"></span>[2](#fn_64.md)\]?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4). thus: 'Him who is less than thee
consider as an equal, and an equal as a superior, (5) and a greater than
him as a chieftain <span id="fr_66"></span>[3](#fn_65.md), and a chieftain
as a ruler. 6. And among rulers *one* is to be acquiescent, obedient,
and true-speaking; (7) *and* among accusers <span
id="fr_67"></span>[4](#fn_66.md) be submissive, mild, and kindly regardful.

8\. 'Commit no slander; (9) so that infamy and wickedness *may* not
happen unto thee. 10. For it is said (11) that slander is more grievous
than witchcraft; (12) and in hell the rush of every fiend <span
id="fr_68"></span>[5](#fn_67.md) is to the front, *but* the rush of the
fiend of slander, on account of the grievous sinfulness, is to the rear.

13\. 'Form no covetous desire; (14) so that the

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

demon of greediness *may* not deceive thee, (15) and the treasure of the
world *may* not be tasteless to thee, and that of the spirit
unperceived.

16\. 'Indulge in no wrathfulness; (17) for a man, when he indulges in
wrath, becomes then forgetful of his duty and good works, of prayer and
the service of the sacred beings, (18) and sin and crime of every kind
occur unto his mind, and <span id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_68.md) until the
subsiding of the wrath (19) he <span id="fr_70"></span>[2](#fn_69.md) is
said *to be* just like Aharman <span id="fr_71"></span>[3](#fn_70.md).

20\. 'Suffer no anxiety; (21) for he who is a sufferer of anxiety
becomes regardless of enjoyment of the world and the spirit, (22) and
contraction happens to his body and soul.

23\. 'Commit no lustfulness; (24) so that harm and regret *may* not
reach thee from thine own actions.

25\. 'Bear no improper envy; (26) so that thy life *may* not become
tasteless.

27\. 'Commit no sin on account of \[disgrace\] <span
id="fr_72"></span>[4](#fn_71); (28.md) because happiness and
adornment <span id="fr_73"></span>[5](#fn_72), celebrity (khanî*d*îh.md)
and dominion, skill and suitability are not through the will and action
of men, but through the appointment, destiny, and will of the sacred
beings.

29\. 'Practise no sloth; (30) so that the duty and good work, which it
is necessary for thee to do, *may* not remain undone.

31\. 'Choose a wife who is of character; (32)

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

because that *one* is good who in the end is more respected.

33\. 'Commit no unseasonable chatter <span
id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_73)'; (34.md) so that grievous distress *may* not
happen unto Ho*r*vada*d* and Ame*r*oda*d*, the archangels <span
id="fr_75"></span>[2](#fn_74.md), through thee.

35\. 'Commit no running about uncovered <span
id="fr_76"></span>[3](#fn_75); (36.md) so that harm *may* not come upon thy
bipeds and quadrupeds, and ruin upon *thy* children.

37\. 'Walk not with one boot <span id="fr_77"></span>[4](#fn_76); (38.md)
so that grievous distress *may* not happen to thy soul.

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

39\. 'Perform no discharge of urine (pê*s*âr-vâr) *standing* on
foot <span id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_77)'; (40.md) so that thou mayst not
become a captive by a habit of the demons, (41) and the demons may not
drag thee to hell on account of that sin.

42\. 'Thou shouldst be (yehevûne*s*) diligent and moderate, (43) and eat
of thine own regular industry, (44) and provide the share of the sacred
beings and the good; (45) and, thus, the practice of this, in thy
occupation, is the greatest good work.

46\. 'Do not extort from the wealth of others; (47) so that thine own
regular industry may *not* become unheeded. 48. For it is said (49)
that: "He who eats anything, not from his own regular industry, but from
another, is such-like as *one* who holds a human head in *his* hand, and
eats human brains."

50\. 'Thou shouldst be an abstainer from the wives of others; (51)
because all these three would become disregarded by thee, alike wealth,
alike <span id="fr_79"></span>[2](#fn_78.md) body, and alike <span
id="fr_80"></span>[2](#fn_78.md) soul.

52\. 'With enemies fight with equity. 53. With a friend proceed with the
approval of friends. 54. With a malicious <span
id="fr_81"></span>[3](#fn_79) man carry on no conflict, (55.md) and do not
molest him in any way whatever. 56. With a greedy man thou shouldst not
be a partner, (57) and do not trust him with the leadership. 58. With

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

a slanderous man do not go to the door of kings. 59. With an ill-famed
man form no connection. 60. With an ignorant man thou shouldst not
become a confederate and associate. 61. With a foolish man make no
dispute. 62. With a drunken man do not walk on the road. 63. From an
ill-natured man take no loan.

64\. 'In thanksgiving unto the sacred beings, and worship, praise,
ceremonies, invocation, and performing the learning of knowledge thou
shouldst be energetic and life-expending. 65. For it is said (66) that:
"In aid of the contingencies (*g*ahisnŏ) <span
id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_80) among men wisdom is good; (67.md) in seeking
renown and preserving the soul liberality is good; (68) in the
advancement of business and justice complete mindfulness is good; (69)
and in the statements of those who confess (khûstîvân) <span
id="fr_83"></span>[2](#fn_81.md), with a bearing on the custom of the
law <span id="fr_84"></span>[3](#fn_82.md), truth is good. 70. In the
progress of business energy is good, (71) for <span
id="fr_85"></span>[4](#fn_83.md) every one to become confident therein
steadfastness is good, (72) and for the coming of benefit thereto
thankfulness is good. 73. In keeping oneself untroubled (anaîrang) <span
id="fr_86"></span>[5](#fn_84.md) the discreet speaking which is in the path
of <span id="fr_87"></span>[6](#fn_85) truth is good; (74.md) and in
keeping away the disturbance of the destroyer <span
id="fr_88"></span>[7](#fn_86.md) from oneself employment is good. 75.

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Before rulers and
kings discreet speaking is good, and in <span
id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_87) an assembly good recital; (76.md) among
friends repose and rational friends <span id="fr_90"></span>[2](#fn_88.md)
are good; (77) and with an associate to one's own deeds the giving of
advantage (sûkŏ) is good. 78. Among those greater than one (a*g*a*s*
masân) mildness and humility are good, (79) and among those less than
one flattery <span id="fr_91"></span>[3](#fn_89.md) and civility are good.
80. Among doers of deeds speaking of thanks and performance of
generosity are good; (81) and among those of the same race the formation
of friendship (hûmânŏîh) <span id="fr_92"></span>[4](#fn_90.md) is good.
82. For bodily health moderate eating and keeping the body in action are
good; (83) and among the skilled in thanksgiving performance is good.
84. Among chieftains unanimity and seeking advantage are good; (85)
among those in unison and servants good behaviour and an exhibition of
awe are good; (86) and for having little trouble in oneself contentment
is good. 87. In chieftainship to understand thoroughly the good in
*their* goodness and the vile in *their* vileness is good; *and* to make
the vile unseen, through retribution <span
id="fr_93"></span>[5](#fn_91.md), is good. 88. In every place and time to
restrain oneself from sin and to be diligent in meritorious work are
good; (89) and every day to consider *and* keep in remembrance
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, as regards creativeness, and Aharman, as regards
destructiveness, is good. 90. *And* for dishonour not to come unto one a
knowledge of oneself is good." 91. All these are proper

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

and true and of the same description, (92) but occupation and guarding
the tongue (pâ*d*-hûzvânîh) <span id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_92.md) above
everything.

93\. 'Abstain far from the service of idols <span
id="fr_95"></span>[2](#fn_93.md) and demon-worship. 94. Because *it* is
declared (95) that "If Kaî-Khûsrôî <span id="fr_96"></span>[3](#fn_94.md)
should not have extirpated the idol-temples (aû*g*dês-*k*âr) which
*were* on the lake of *K*ê*k*ast <span id="fr_97"></span>[4](#fn_95.md),
then in these three millenniums *of* Hûshê*d*ar, Hûshe*d*ar-mâh, and
Sôshâns <span id="fr_98"></span>[5](#fn_96.md)—of whom one of them comes
separately at the end of each millennium, who arranges again all <span
id="fr_99"></span>[6](#fn_97.md) the affairs of the world, and utterly
destroys the breakers of promises and servers of idols who are in the
realm—the adversary <span id="fr_100"></span>[7](#fn_98.md) would have
become so much more violent, that it would not have been possible to
produce the resurrection and future existence."

96\. 'In forming a store <span id="fr_101"></span>[8](#fn_99.md) of good
works thou

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

shouldst be diligent, (97) so that it *may* come to *thy* <span
id="fr_102"></span>[1](#fn_100.md) assistance among the spirits.

98\. 'Thou shouldst not become presumptuous through any happiness of the
world; (99) for the happiness of the world is such-like as a cloud that
comes on a rainy day, which one does not ward off by any hill.

100\. 'Thou shouldst not be *too* much arranging the world; (101) for
the world-arranging man becomes spirit-destroying.

102\. 'Thou shouldst not become presumptuous through much treasure and
wealth; (103) for in the end it is necessary for thee to leave all.

104\. 'Thou shouldst not become presumptuous through predominance; (105)
for in the end it is necessary for thee to become non-predominant.

106\. 'Thou shouldst not become presumptuous through respect and
reverence; (107) for respectfulness does not assist in the spiritual
*existence*.

108\. 'Thou shouldst not become presumptuous through great connections
and race; (109) for in the end thy <span id="fr_103"></span>[2](#fn_101.md)
trust is on thine own deeds.

110\. 'Thou shouldst not become presumptuous through life; (111) for
death comes upon thee <span id="fr_104"></span>[3](#fn_102.md) at last,
(112) the dog and the bird lacerate the corpse <span
id="fr_105"></span>[4](#fn_103), (113.md) and the perishable *part*
(se*g*înakŏ) <span id="fr_106"></span>[5](#fn_104.md) falls to the ground.
114. During three days <span id="fr_107"></span>[6](#fn_105.md) and nights

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

the soul sits at the crown of the head of the body <span
id="fr_108"></span>[1](#fn_106.md). 115. And the fourth day, in the light
of dawn—with the co-operation of Srôsh the righteous, Vâê the good, and
Vâhrâm the strong <span id="fr_109"></span>[2](#fn_107.md), the opposition
of Astô-vîdâ*d* <span id="fr_110"></span>[3](#fn_108.md), Vâê the bad <span
id="fr_111"></span>[4](#fn_109.md), Frazî*s*tô the demon, and Nizî*s*tô the
demon <span id="fr_112"></span>[5](#fn_110.md), and the evil-designing
action of Aeshm <span id="fr_113"></span>[6](#fn_111.md), the evil-doer,
the impetuous assailant—

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[it goes\] <span
id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_112.md) up to the awful, lofty *K*indvar <span
id="fr_115"></span>[2](#fn_113.md) bridge, to which every one, righteous
and wicked, is coming <span id="fr_116"></span>[3](#fn_114.md). 116. And
many opponents have watched there, (117) with the desire of evil of
Aeshm, the impetuous assailant, and of Astô-vîdâ*d* who devours
creatures of every kind and knows no satiety, (118) and the mediation of
Mit*r*ô <span id="fr_117"></span>[4](#fn_115.md) and Srôsh and Rashnû,
(119) and the weighing of Rashnû, the just, (120) with the balance <span
id="fr_118"></span>[5](#fn_116.md) *of* the spirits, which renders no
favour (hû-girâî) *on* any side <span id="fr_119"></span>[6](#fn_117.md),
neither for the righteous nor yet the wicked, neither for the lords nor
yet the monarchs. 121. As much as a hair's breadth it will not turn, and
has no partiality; (122) and he who is a lord and monarch <span
id="fr_120"></span>[7](#fn_118.md) it considers equally, in *its* decision,
with him who is the least of mankind.

123\. 'And when a soul of the righteous passes upon that bridge, the
width of the bridge becomes as it were a league (parasang) <span
id="fr_121"></span>[8](#fn_119), (124.md) and the

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

righteous soul passes over with the co-operation of Srôsh the righteous.
125. And his own deeds of a virtuous kind <span
id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_120.md) come to meet him in the form of a
maiden, (126) who is handsomer and better than every maiden in the
world.

127\. 'And the righteous soul speaks (128) thus: "Who mayst thou
be <span id="fr_123"></span>[2](#fn_121.md), that a maiden who is handsomer
and better than thee *was* never seen by me in the worldly *existence*?"

129\. 'In reply that maiden form responds (130) thus: "I am no maiden,
but I am thy virtuous deeds, *thou* youth who *art* well-thinking,
well-speaking, well-doing, *and* of good religion! 131. For when thou
sawest in the world *him* who performed demon-worship, then thou hast
sat down, and thy performance *was* the worship of the sacred beings.
132. And when *it was* seen by thee that *there was* any one who caused
oppression and plunder, and distressed *or* scorned a good person, and
acquired wealth by crime, then thou keptest back from the creatures
their own *risk of* oppression and plunder; (133) the good person *was*
also thought of by thee, and lodging and entertainment provided; and
alms *were* given by thee *to him* (134) who came forth from near and
*him*, too, who *was* from afar; and wealth which *was* due to honesty
*was* acquired by thee. 135. And when thou sawest *him* who practised

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

false justice and taking of bribes, and false evidence was given by him,
then thou hast sat down, and the recitation of truth and virtue <span
id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_122.md) *was* uttered by thee. 136. I am this of
thine, the good thoughts, the good words, and the good deeds which
*were* thought and spoken and done by thee. 137. For when I have become
commendable, I am then made altogether more commendable by thee; (138)
when I have become precious, I am then made altogether still more
precious by thee; (139) and when I have become glorious, I am then made
altogether <span id="fr_125"></span>[2](#fn_123.md) still more glorious by
thee."

140\. 'And when he walks onwards from there, a sweet-scented breeze
comes then to meet him, which is more fragrant than all perfume. 141.
The soul of the righteous enquires of Srôsh (142) thus: "What breeze is
this, that never in the world so fragrant a breeze came into contact
with me?"

143\. 'Then Srôsh, the righteous, replies to that righteous soul (144)
thus: "This breeze is from heaven, which is so fragrant."

145\. 'Afterwards, on *his* march, the first step is set <span
id="fr_126"></span>[3](#fn_124.md) on *the place of* good thoughts, the
second on *that of* good words, the third on *that of* good deeds <span
id="fr_127"></span>[4](#fn_125), (146.md) and the fourth step reaches up
unto the endless light <span id="fr_128"></span>[5](#fn_126.md) which is
all-radiant. 147. And angels

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

and archangels of every description come to meet him, (148) and ask
tidings from him (149) thus: "How hast thou come, from that which is a
perishable; fearful, *and* very miserable existence, to this which is an
imperishable existence that is undisturbed, *thou* youth who *art*
well-thinking, well-speaking, well-doing, *and* of good religion?"

150\. 'Then Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the lord, speaks (151) thus: "Ask ye from him
no tidings; for *he has* parted from that which *was* a precious body,
and has come by that which is a fearful road. 152. And bring ye unto him
the most agreeable of eatables, that which is the midspring butter <span
id="fr_129"></span>[1](#fn_127), (153.md) so that he *may* rest his soul
from that bridge pf the three nights, unto which he came from
Astô-vîdâ*d* and the remaining demons <span
id="fr_130"></span>[2](#fn_128); (154.md) and seat him upon an
all-embellished throne."

155\. 'As *it is* declared (156) that: "'Unto <span
id="fr_131"></span>[3](#fn_129.md) the righteous man <span
id="fr_132"></span>[4](#fn_130.md) and woman, after passing away <span
id="fr_133"></span>[5](#fn_131.md), they bring food <span
id="fr_134"></span>[6](#fn_132.md) of the most agreeable of eatables—

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

the food of the angels of the spiritual *existences*— that which is the
midspring butter <span id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_133.md); and they seat
them down on an all-embellished throne. 157. For ever and everlasting
they remain in all glory with the angels of the spiritual *existences*
everlastingly."

158\. 'And when he who is wicked dies, his soul then rushes *about for*
three days and nights in the vicinity of the head of that wicked *one*,
and sobs <span id="fr_136"></span>[2](#fn_134) (159.md) thus: "Whither do I
go, and now what do I make <span id="fr_137"></span>[3](#fn_135.md) as a
refuge?" 160. And the sin and crime of every kind, that *were* committed
by him in the worldly *existence*, he sees with *his* eyes in those
three days and nights. 161. The fourth day Vîzaresh <span
id="fr_138"></span>[4](#fn_136.md), the demon, comes and binds the soul or
the wicked with the very evil noose <span
id="fr_139"></span>[5](#fn_137); (162.md) and with the opposition of Srôsh,
the righteous, he leads *it* up to the *K*indvar bridge <span
id="fr_140"></span>[6](#fn_138.md). 163. Then Rashnû <span
id="fr_141"></span>[7](#fn_139.md), the just, detects that soul of the
wicked through *its* wickedness.

164\. 'Afterwards, Vîzaresh, the demon, takes that

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

soul of the wicked, and mercilessly and maliciously beats *and*
maltreats *it*. 165. And that soul of the wicked weeps with a loud
voice, is fundamentally horrified <span id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_140.md),
implores with many supplicating <span id="fr_143"></span>[2](#fn_141.md)
entreaties, and makes many struggles for life disconnectedly <span
id="fr_144"></span>[3](#fn_142.md). 166. Whom <span
id="fr_145"></span>[4](#fn_143.md)—when his struggling and supplication are
of no avail whatever, and no one comes to his assistance from the
divinities (bagân) <span id="fr_146"></span>[5](#fn_144.md), nor yet from
the demons—moreover, Vîzaresh, the demon, drags miserably <span
id="fr_147"></span>[6](#fn_145.md) to the inevitable <span
id="fr_148"></span>[7](#fn_146.md) hell.

167\. 'And then a maiden who is not like unto maidens comes to meet him.
168. And that soul of the wicked speaks to that evil maiden (169) thus:
"Who mayst thou be, that never in the worldly *existence was* an evil
maiden seen by me, who was viler and more hideous than thee?"

170\. 'And she <span id="fr_149"></span>[8](#fn_147.md) speaks in reply to
him (171) thus: "I *am* not a maiden, but I am thy deeds <span
id="fr_150"></span>[9](#fn_148.md), *thou* monster who *art* evil-thinking,
evil-speaking, evildoing, *and* of evil religion! 172. For even when
thou sawest <span id="fr_151"></span>[10](#fn_149.md) *him* who performed
the worship of the sacred beings, still then thou hast sat down, and
demon-worship *was* performed by thee, (173) and the demons and fiends
were served. 174. And also when thou sawest *him* who provided lodging
and

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

entertainment, and gave alms, *for* a good person who came forth from
near and *him*, too, who *was* from afar <span
id="fr_152"></span>[1](#fn_150), (175.md) then thou actedst scornfully and
disrespectfully *to* the good person, and gave no alms, and even shut up
the door. 176. And when thou sawest *him* who practised true justice,
took no bribe, gave true evidence, and uttered virtuous recitation,
(177) even then thou hast sat down, and false justice *was* practised by
thee, evidence *was* given by thee with falsehood, and vicious
recitation *was* uttered by thee. 178. I am this of thine, the evil
thoughts, the evil words, and the evil deeds which *were* thought and
spoken and done by thee. 179. For when I have become uncommendable, I am
then made altogether still more uncommendable by thee; (180) when I have
become unrespected, I am then made altogether still more unrespected by
thee; (181) and when I have sat in an eye-offending <span
id="fr_153"></span>[2](#fn_151.md) position, I am then made altogether
still more really eye-offending (*k*ashm-kah-î*k*tar-i*k*) by thee."

182\. 'Afterwards he enters <span id="fr_154"></span>[3](#fn_152.md), the
first step on *the place of* evil thoughts, the second on *that of* evil
words, the third step on *that of* evil deeds <span
id="fr_155"></span>[4](#fn_153), (183.md) and the fourth step rushes into
the presence of the

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

wicked evil spirit and the other demons <span
id="fr_156"></span>[1](#fn_154.md). 184. And the demons make ridicule and
mockery of him (185) thus: "What was thy trouble and complaint, as
regards Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the lord, and the archangels, and the fragrant
and joyful heaven, when thou approachedst for a sight of Aharman and the
demons and gloomy hell, (186) although we cause thee misery therein and
do not pity, and thou shalt see misery of long duration?"

187\. 'And the evil spirit shouts to the demons (188) thus: "Ask ye no
tidings from him (189) who is parted *from* <span
id="fr_157"></span>[2](#fn_155.md) that which *was* a precious body, and
has come on by that which is a very bad road. 190. But bring ye unto him
the foulest and vilest of eatables, the food which is nurtured in hell."

191\. 'They bring the poison and venom of <span
id="fr_158"></span>[3](#fn_156.md) the snake and scorpion and other noxious
creatures that are in hell, (192) and give him to eat. 193. And until

195\. The spirit of innate wisdom spoke to the sage (196) thus: 'This
which *was* asked by thee, as to the maintenance of the body *and*
concerning the preservation of the soul, is also spoken about by me, and
thou art admonished. 197. Be virtuously

assiduous about it, and keep *it* in practice; (198) for this is thy
chief way for the maintenance of the body *and* preservation of the
soul.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_64"></span>[9:2](sbe24008.htm#fr_65.md) The passage in
brackets is omitted by K43, and is here supplied from L19.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[9:3](sbe24008.htm#fr_66.md) In L19 the text is
corrupt, but has nearly the same meaning.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[9:4](sbe24008.htm#fr_67.md) L19 has 'associates,'
which seems equally appropriate; the two words are much alike in Pahlavi
writing.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[9:5](sbe24008.htm#fr_68.md) The word drû*g*,
'fiend,' is usually supposed to mean a female demon, and is often
understood so in the Avesta, perhaps because it is a feminine noun. It
is usually an impersonation of some evil passion (see Chap. XLI, 11).

<span id="fn_68"></span>[10:1](sbe24008.htm#fr_69.md) L19 omits 'and.'

<span id="fn_69"></span>[10:2](sbe24008.htm#fr_70.md) L19 has 'wrath;'
making § 19 a separate sentence.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[10:3](sbe24008.htm#fr_71.md) The evil spirit, Av.
angra mainyu.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[10:4](sbe24008.htm#fr_72.md) K43 omits 'disgrace,'
by mistake.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[10:5](sbe24008.htm#fr_73.md) L19 omits
'adornment.'

<span id="fn_73"></span>[11:1](sbe24008.htm#fr_74.md) A free translation of
the name of the sin which is usually called drâyân-*g*ûyi*s*nîh,
'eagerness for chattering;' here, however, K43 omits the latter y, so
that the name may be read drâyân-*g*a*lis*nîh, 'chatteringly devouring,'
and a similar phrase is used in AV. XXIII, 6. The sin consists in
talking while eating, praying, or at any other time when a murmured
prayer (vâ*g*) has been taken inwardly and is not yet spoken out; the
protective spell of the prayer being broken by such talking. If the
prayer be not taken inwardly when it ought to be, the same sin is
incurred (see Sls. V, 2, Dd. LXXIX, 8).

<span id="fn_74"></span>[11:2](sbe24008.htm#fr_75.md) Instead of
amah*r*aspend, 'the archangel,' L19 has Mârspe*n*d, the angel of the
'righteous liturgy;' but this is probably a misreading, due to the fact
that, when the chattering interrupts prayer, the angel of the liturgy
would be as much distressed as the archangels Ho*r*vada*d* and
Ame*r*oda*d*, who protect water and vegetation (see Sls. XV, 25-29),
would be when it interrupts eating and drinking. These archangels are
personifications of Av. haurvatâ*d*, 'completeness or health,' and
ameretâ*d*, 'immortality.'

<span id="fn_75"></span>[11:3](sbe24008.htm#fr_76.md) That is, moving about
without being girded with the Kustî or sacred thread-girdle, which must
not be separated from the skin by more than one thin garment, the sacred
shirt (see Sls. IV, 7, 8).

<span id="fn_76"></span>[11:4](sbe24008.htm#fr_77.md) We should probably
read 'without a boot,' as aê-mûkŏ and amûkŏ are much alike in Pahlavi;
otherwise we must suppose that walking with only a single covering for
the feet, and without outer boots, is meant. At any rate, walking or
standing on unconsecrated ground with bare feet is a serious sin for a
Parsi, on account of the risk of pollution (see Sls. IV, 12, X, 22).

<span id="fn_77"></span>[12:1](sbe24008.htm#fr_78.md) Whereby an
unnecessary space of ground is polluted; hence the sin.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[12:2](sbe24008.htm#fr_80.md) K43 has hômânam, 'I
am,' the Huzvâri*s* of am, used by mistake for ham, 'alike,' which is
written exactly like am in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[12:3](sbe24008.htm#fr_81.md) K43 has kîkvar,
instead of kênvar, but this is doubtless a miswriting.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[13:1](sbe24008.htm#fr_82.md) L19 has zahi*s*n,
'issue, proceedings.'

<span id="fn_81"></span>[13:2](sbe24008.htm#fr_83.md) L19 has read
aûstîkân, 'the steadfast,' by mistake.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[13:3](sbe24008.htm#fr_84.md) Reading
dâ*d*ŏ-khûk-bari*s*nŏîhâ. L19 has 'conveying intercession (*g*âda*n*gô =
dâ*d*ŏ-gôk);' this small difference in reading may be a clerical error
in K43. The Sans. version omits the phrase altogether.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[13:4](sbe24008.htm#fr_85.md) L19 omits pavan,
'for.'

<span id="fn_84"></span>[13:5](sbe24008.htm#fr_86.md) Nêr. has
'unblemished.'

<span id="fn_85"></span>[13:6](sbe24008.htm#fr_87.md) L19 omits 'path of;'
and it may possibly be superfluous.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[13:7](sbe24008.htm#fr_88.md) Or it may be 'the
destroyer and adversary,' as in L19; the last word being defective in
K43.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[14:1](sbe24008.htm#fr_89.md) L19 omits pavan,
'in.'

<span id="fn_88"></span>[14:2](sbe24008.htm#fr_90.md) L19 has 'friendship.'

<span id="fn_89"></span>[14:3](sbe24008.htm#fr_91.md) Or 'adaptation.'

<span id="fn_90"></span>[14:4](sbe24008.htm#fr_92.md) L19 has humatî, 'good
intention.'

<span id="fn_91"></span>[14:5](sbe24008.htm#fr_93.md) L19 has 'to cause the
reward of the good and the punishment of the vile.'

<span id="fn_92"></span>[15:1](sbe24008.htm#fr_94.md) L19 has 'preserving
pure language.'

<span id="fn_93"></span>[15:2](sbe24008.htm#fr_95.md) More correctly
'temple-worship,' as aûzdes means 'an erection.'

<span id="fn_94"></span>[15:3](sbe24008.htm#fr_96.md) Av. Kavi Husravangh,
the third of the Kayân kings, who reigned sixty years, and was the
grandson of his predecessor, Kâî-Ûs, and son of Sîyâvakhsh (see Bd.
XXXI, 25, XXXIV, 7).

<span id="fn_95"></span>[15:4](sbe24008.htm#fr_97.md) The present Lake
Urumiyah according to Bd. XXII, 2. This feat of Kaî-Khûsrôî is also
mentioned in Bd. XVII, 7, and his exploits in the same neighbourhood are
stated in Âbân Yt. 49, 50, Gô*s* Yt. 18, 21, 22, Ashi Yt. 38, 41, 42;
but it is possible that the Avesta name, *K*aê*k*asta, may have been
transferred to Lake Urumiyah in later times.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[15:5](sbe24008.htm#fr_98.md) The three future
apostles who are supposed to be sons of Zaratû*s*t, whose births have
been deferred till later times (see Bd. XXXII, 8). Their Avesta names
are Ukhshya*d*-ereta, Ukhshya*d*-nemangh, and Saoshyãs.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[15:6](sbe24008.htm#fr_99.md) L19 omits 'all.'

<span id="fn_98"></span>[15:7](sbe24008.htm#fr_100.md) The evil spirit.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[15:8](sbe24008.htm#fr_101.md) L19 has 'in always
doing;' having read hamvâr, 'always,' instead of ambâr, 'a store.'

<span id="fn_100"></span>[16:1](sbe24008.htm#fr_102.md) K43 omits 'thy.'

<span id="fn_101"></span>[16:2](sbe24008.htm#fr_103.md) L19 omits 'thy.'

<span id="fn_102"></span>[16:3](sbe24008.htm#fr_104.md) L19 omits 'thee.'

<span id="fn_103"></span>[16:4](sbe24008.htm#fr_105.md) Referring to the
mode of disposing of the dead adopted by the Parsis (see Sls. II, 6 n,
Dd. XV, 5, XVII, 17, XVIII, 2-4).

<span id="fn_104"></span>[16:5](sbe24008.htm#fr_106.md) L19 has ast,
'bone.'

<span id="fn_105"></span>[16:6](sbe24008.htm#fr_107.md) Including the day
of death. The fate of the soul after death, as detailed in §§ 114-194,
is also described in Vend. XIX, 90-112, Hn. II, III, Aog. 8-19, AV.
IV-XI, XVII.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[17:1](sbe24008.htm#fr_108.md) Reciting a passage
from the Gâthas or sacred hymns (see Hn. II, 4, 5, III, 3, 4, AV. IV,
9-11, XVII, 6, 7).

<span id="fn_107"></span>[17:2](sbe24008.htm#fr_109.md) These three angels
are personifications of Av. sraosha, 'listening, obedience,' vaya or
vayu, 'the upper air (uncontaminated by the evil spirit),' and
verethraghna, 'victorious, triumphant;' the last is more literally
'demon-smiting,' that is, 'smiting Verethra (the demon),' Sans.
v*ri*trahan.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[17:3](sbe24008.htm#fr_110.md) Av. Astô-vîdhôtu,
'the bone-dislocator,' or demon of death who binds the parting soul (see
Vend. V, 25, 31); in later. writings, such as the Book of Dâdâr bin
Dâd-dukht, he is said to throw a noose over the neck of the soul to drag
it to hell, but if its good works have exceeded its sins, it throws off
the noose and goes to heaven; and this noose is also mentioned in Bd.
III, 22, Dd. XVIII, 3. In Bd. XXVIII, 35 this demon is said to be the
same as the bad Vâê, but all other authorities consider them as distinct
beings. It may be noted that a different demon of death is usually
mentioned when the soul is wicked (see § 161).

<span id="fn_109"></span>[17:4](sbe24008.htm#fr_111.md) Av. vaya or vayu,
'the lower air (vitiated by the evil spirit).' Just as the wind (vâ*d*)
may be either an angel or a demon, according as its strength makes it a
refreshing breeze or a violent hurricane, so may the air be a good or
evil being, according as it retains its original purity or has been
vitiated by the evil spirit. That the angel Vâê is the upper air appears
from its epithet uparô-kairya, 'working aloft,' in the Râm Yt.; and that
it is only the lower air that is vitiated by the evil spirit is in
accordance with the division of the sky into three thirds, of which the
uppermost is inaccessible to the evil spirit (see Dd. XXXVII, 24-31).
But this distinction between a good and bad Vâê is not made in Vend. V,
25, 31, where we are told that Vayô conveys the soul when bound by
Astô-vîdhôtu.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[17:5](sbe24008.htm#fr_112.md) These two demons
have not been recognised elsewhere.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[17:6](sbe24008.htm#fr_113.md) The demon of wrath,
Av. Aêshmô daêva, appears to be the Asmodeus of the Book of Tobit.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[18:1](sbe24008.htm#fr_114.md) K43 omits this
verb.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[18:2](sbe24008.htm#fr_115.md) Or, perhaps,
*K*ingvar, a partial translation of Av. *K*inva*d* (gv being a
mispronunciation of v or w, as in gvâ*d* for vâ*d*, 'wind;' and Pers.
var translating Av. va*d*). The Pâzand writers have *K*a*n*dôr. It is
the bridge of ever-varying breadth which leads to heaven (see Vend. XIX,
100, 101, AV. III, 1, IV, 7, V, 1, 2, XVII, 1, Bd. XII, 7, Dd. XX, XXI),
but it is not mentioned in Hn.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[18:3](sbe24008.htm#fr_116.md) Literally, 'is a
corner.'

<span id="fn_115"></span>[18:4](sbe24008.htm#fr_117.md) The angel of the
sun's light; being a personification of friendship and good faith he is
specially concerned in calling the soul to account (see Dd. XIV, 3).

<span id="fn_116"></span>[18:5](sbe24008.htm#fr_118.md) In which the
actions of men are weighed by Rashnû, the angel of justice, to ascertain
whether the good or the evil preponderate.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[18:6](sbe24008.htm#fr_119.md) 1.19 has 'who makes
no unjust balance of the spirits on either side.'

<span id="fn_118"></span>[18:7](sbe24008.htm#fr_120.md) K43 adds ra*d*,
'master,' but this is evidently an abortive beginning of the next word,
levatman, which has been left unerased.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[18:8](sbe24008.htm#fr_121.md) Nine spears (about
126 English feet) in AV. V, 1, Dd. XXI, 5. <span id="page_19">p.
19</span> The parasang is probably used here as an equivalent for Av.
hâthra, 'a mile.'

<span id="fn_120"></span>[19:1](sbe24008.htm#fr_122.md) L19 has 'his own
virtuous deeds.' The conscience of the soul meets it in the form of a
damsel, beautiful in proportion to the goodness of its deeds. In AV. IV,
18-36, Dd. XXIV, 5, XXV, 5 the conscience meets the soul before it
attempts the bridge.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[19:2](sbe24008.htm#fr_123.md) More literally,
'what may be thou?' as the verb is in the third person here, though not
so in the similar phrase in § 169.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[20:1](sbe24008.htm#fr_124.md) Meaning probably
the recitation of the Avesta texts.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[20:2](sbe24008.htm#fr_125.md) K43 omits ba*r*â,
'quite, altogether,' in this third clause.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[20:3](sbe24008.htm#fr_126.md) L19 has
'afterwards, he rests the first step;' but awar ârâme*d*, 'he rests,' is
a misreading of madam khârâm dâ*d*, 'on the march is set.'

<span id="fn_125"></span>[20:4](sbe24008.htm#fr_127.md) These are the three
lowermost grades of heaven, hûmat, hûkht, and hûvar*s*t (see Chap. VII,
12).

<span id="fn_126"></span>[20:5](sbe24008.htm#fr_128.md) The highest grade
of heaven, where Aûha*r*ma*zd* and the angels are supposed to dwell (see
Chap. VII, 11).

<span id="fn_127"></span>[21:1](sbe24008.htm#fr_129.md) The Maidhyô-zarm
rôghan, which is explained in Dd. XXXI, 14 as the spiritual
representative of butter made during the Maidhyô-zaremaya,
'mid-verdure,' festival, which was considered the best of the year. This
festival is held on the forty-fifth day of the Parsi year, which was
about 4th May when the year was fixed to begin at the vernal equinox as
described in Bd. XXV, 3-7, 20. The heavenly food which goes by this name
is not to be confounded with the Hûsh which is expected to be prepared
at the resurrection, from the fat of the ox Hadhayô*s* and the white
Hôm, for the purpose of making mankind immortal (see Bd. XXX, 25);
although some such confusion appears to exist in AV. X, 5. K43 has
rûbân, 'soul,' instead of rôghan, 'butter.'

<span id="fn_128"></span>[21:2](sbe24008.htm#fr_130.md) See §§ 114-123.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[21:3](sbe24008.htm#fr_131.md) K43 omits 'unto.'

<span id="fn_130"></span>[21:4](sbe24008.htm#fr_132.md) Literally, 'male.'

<span id="fn_131"></span>[21:5](sbe24008.htm#fr_133.md) L19 adds 'from the
body and consciousness.'

<span id="fn_132"></span>[21:6](sbe24008.htm#fr_134.md) Reading kazag,
instead of kazad, both here and in the next clause of the sentence. L19
has 'the angels of the spiritual *existences* <span id="page_22">p.
22</span> bring the most agreeable of eatables,' by omitting the first
kazag, and misreading the second one.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[22:1](sbe24008.htm#fr_135.md) K43 has rûbân
again, as in § 152, for rôghan. Although this sentence resembles Hn. II,
38, 39, it is evidently quoted from some other source, as its difference
is more striking than its resemblance.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[22:2](sbe24008.htm#fr_136.md) This verb is Huz.
bekhûnê*d* = Pâz. giryê*d*, but Nêr. has read bângînê*d*, 'laments,' and
has written vãgine*d*.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[22:3](sbe24008.htm#fr_137.md) Or it may be
'take,' as these two verbs are written alike in Huzvâri*s*. This
exclamation is a quotation from the Gâthas or sacred hymns, being the
first line of Yas. XLV, 1.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[22:4](sbe24008.htm#fr_138.md) The Av. Vîzaresha
of Vend. XIX, 94, who carries off the souls of the wicked; he is also
mentioned in Bd. XXVIII, 18, Dd. XXXII, 4, 7, XXXVII, 44.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[22:5](sbe24008.htm#fr_139.md) Reading saryâtar
*s*û*l*an. L19 has va*d* ba*n*d, 'an evil tie.'

<span id="fn_138"></span>[22:6](sbe24008.htm#fr_140.md) See § 115.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[22:7](sbe24008.htm#fr_141.md) See §§ 229, 120.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[23:1](sbe24008.htm#fr_142.md) Instead of
bur*z*-vângîhâ bekhûnê*d*, bun râmê*d*, L19 has burzâva*n*dihâ vãgîne*d*
u vârâme*d*, 'loudly shrieks and weeps.'

<span id="fn_141"></span>[23:2](sbe24008.htm#fr_143.md) Reading
lâpakŏ-karîhâ.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[23:3](sbe24008.htm#fr_144.md) Instead of
apa*d*vandîhâ, L19 has apatûihâ, 'fruitlessly.'

<span id="fn_143"></span>[23:4](sbe24008.htm#fr_145.md) L19 has 'and.'

<span id="fn_144"></span>[23:5](sbe24008.htm#fr_146.md) L19 has vehã, 'the
good.'

<span id="fn_145"></span>[23:6](sbe24008.htm#fr_147.md) Instead of
âk-hômandîhâ, L19 has anaom*e*dihâ, 'hopelessly.'

<span id="fn_146"></span>[23:7](sbe24008.htm#fr_148.md) Reading nagirz, but
this is uncertain; L19 has az*e*r, 'lower.'

<span id="fn_147"></span>[23:8](sbe24008.htm#fr_149.md) L19 has 'that evil
maiden.'

<span id="fn_148"></span>[23:9](sbe24008.htm#fr_150.md) L19 has 'evil
deeds.'

<span id="fn_149"></span>[23:10](sbe24008.htm#fr_151.md) L19 adds 'in the
world.'

<span id="fn_150"></span>[24:1](sbe24008.htm#fr_152.md) In L19 the words
'near' and 'afar' change places.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[24:2](sbe24008.htm#fr_153.md) Literally,
'eye-consuming,' the reading adopted by Nêr., but, though it gives a
satisfactory meaning, it is not quite certain that it represents the
Pahlavi text correctly.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[24:3](sbe24008.htm#fr_154.md) For dên vazlûnê*d*,
'he goes in,' L19 has a*n*dar zrôve*d*, indicating that the first
letter, va, of vazlûnê*d* had been omitted in the Pahl. MS. used by
Nêr., which misled him into reading the remaining letters as a new Pâz.
verb zrôve*d*, as already by Nŏldeke in Gŏt. gel. Anz. 1882, p. 975.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[24:4](sbe24008.htm#fr_155.md) These are the three
uppermost grades of hell, dû*s*-hûmat. dû*s*-hûkht, and dû*s*-hûvar*s*t
(see Chap. VII, 20).

<span id="fn_154"></span>[25:1](sbe24008.htm#fr_156.md) In the lowermost
grade of hell (see Chap. VII, 21).

<span id="fn_155"></span>[25:2](sbe24008.htm#fr_157.md) L19 has 'for *he
has* parted from,' as in § 151.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[25:3](sbe24008.htm#fr_158.md) L19 has 'and.'

<span id="fn_157"></span>[25:4](sbe24008.htm#fr_159.md) L19 has 'he is in
much misery and punishment of kinds worthy of hell.'

<span id="fn_158"></span>[25:5](sbe24008.htm#fr_160.md) So that starvation
is one of the punishments of hell. L19 has 'and especially that the food
there can be only like putrid blood.'
