### CHAPTER LXIII.

1\. The sixty-third subject is this, that it is necessary to practise
strict abstinence from adultery on this account, that *through* every
one who beguiles the wife of another, and commits iniquity with her,
that woman becomes, in a moment, unlawful as regards *her* husband. 2.
And, after that, every time her husband comes round about her, it is
just as though she had gone near to a strange man. 3. The righteous
bestowal <span id="fr_1404"></span>[4](#fn_1393.md) *of herself* on her own
husband, in this

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

situation, is always worse *than his going* <span
id="fr_1405"></span>[1](#fn_1394.md) with women of a different religion, on
this account, that, if that wife becomes pregnant, it is just as though
one of the good religion had fallen *away* into a different religion,
and <span id="fr_1406"></span>[2](#fn_1395.md) thereby that man becomes
worthy of death.

4\. And it also happens, when that wife becomes pregnant, *that* she
*may* effect the slaughter of the infant, from fear of a bad reputation.
5. Then, *for* that person whose child it is, it is just as though he
had effected the slaughter of the child with his own hand; therefore, he
is worthy of death. 6. If the infant be born, and it remains <span
id="fr_1407"></span>[3](#fn_1396.md) in the religion, every sin that that
child of his commits is, for that person, just as though it were
committed by his own hand.

7\. And if a woman of those of the good religion commits *adultery*, she
becomes in a condition unlawful as regards *her* husband; *and* if an
infant be born it is illegitimate. 8. And the sin owing to this will
depart *at* the time when that person goes near to her husband *and*
shall say: 'What is *there* in me befitting thy wife? 9. A calamity (âk)
*has* occurred, and a crime (‘*h*a*t*â) *has* come into *my* body; thou
knowest if thou *wilt* exercise forgiveness (’hafû), and if not, when
*it is* not for me, do thou kill *me*; my blood is lawful (‘halâl) unto
thee.' 10. If he shall kill her, her sin will depart owing to this;

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

otherwise, this sin will not depart from her in any manner (navaî) <span
id="fr_1408"></span>[1](#fn_1397.md).

11\. And *one* calls this sin a sin *affecting* antagonists <span
id="fr_1409"></span>[2](#fn_1398.md), *and*, so long as the antagonist does
not become satisfied, the sin flows on <span
id="fr_1410"></span>[3](#fn_1399.md), *and* they keep his soul back at the
head of the *K*inva*d* bridge, till the time that its antagonist shall
arrive and himself accomplishes *his* antagonism, and they give him back
a reply <span id="fr_1411"></span>[4](#fn_1400.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1393"></span>[324:4](sbe24151.htm#fr_1404.md) Lp inserts 'he
shall wish.'

<span id="fn_1394"></span>[325:1](sbe24151.htm#fr_1405.md) B29 has 'it
never becomes a righteous bestowal of herself on *her* husband, and if,
in this situation, he is also.'

<span id="fn_1395"></span>[325:2](sbe24151.htm#fr_1406.md) B29 omits 'and.'

<span id="fn_1396"></span>[325:3](sbe24151.htm#fr_1407.md) Lp, B29 have 'it
does not remain,' but the text seems to be assuming that the illicit
origin of the child is unsuspected, in which case it would undoubtedly
remain in the religion, as it would probably do in any case.

<span id="fn_1397"></span>[326:1](sbe24151.htm#fr_1408.md) B29 omits these
eleven words.

<span id="fn_1398"></span>[326:2](sbe24151.htm#fr_1409.md) Or accusers
(see-Chap. XLII, 1, 2).

<span id="fn_1399"></span>[326:3](sbe24151.htm#fr_1410.md) B29 has 'it
flows on,' if we read bi-rêzad; but the Gu*g*arâti translator seems to
take gunâh-barêza*d* (Av. bereza*n*t) as a technical epithet for the
soul, as though he would say 'they keep back the soul of him *whose* sin
is rampant.'

<span id="fn_1400"></span>[326:4](sbe24151.htm#fr_1411.md) That is, the
investigating angels announce their decision as to the proper fate of
the soul they have detained.
