### CHAPTER IV.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (?) thus: 'Which is a good work
*that is* great and good?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'The greatest good work is
liberality, and the second is truth and next-of-kin marriage <span
id="fr_165"></span>[5](#fn_163.md). 5. The third is

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

*keeping* the season festivals <span id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_164.md),
*and* the fourth is *celebrating* all the religious rites <span
id="fr_167"></span>[2](#fn_165.md). 6. The fifth is the ceremonial of the
sacred beings, and the providing of lodging for traders <span
id="fr_168"></span>[3](#fn_166.md). 7. The sixth is the wishing of
happiness for every one. 8. *And* the seventh is a kind regard for the
good <span id="fr_169"></span>[4](#fn_167.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_163"></span>[26:5](sbe24010.htm#fr_165.md) This was the
meaning of the term khvêtûk-das when this work was written, but some
centuries ago such marriages were discontinued, and the term was then
confined to marriages between first cousins, as at present (see Sacred
Books of the East, vol. xviii, app. III).

<span id="fn_164"></span>[27:1](sbe24010.htm#fr_166.md) Of which there are
six, each held for five days. These Gâsânbârs or Gâhambârs end,
respectively, on the 45th, 105th, 180th, 210th, 290th, and 365th days of
the Parsi year; and when that year was fixed to begin at the vernal
equinox, they celebrated the periods of midspring, midsummer, the
beginning of autumn, the beginning of winter, midwinter, and the
beginning of spring (see Sls. XVIII, 3). In modern times they have been
supposed to commemorate the several creations of the sky, water, earth,
vegetation, animals, and man; but this idea must have been borrowed from
a foreign source.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[27:2](sbe24010.htm#fr_167.md) The periodical
ceremonies which are obligatory for all Parsis (see Dd. XLIV, 2 n).

<span id="fn_166"></span>[27:3](sbe24010.htm#fr_168.md) Literally, 'for the
producers of business.'

<span id="fn_167"></span>[27:4](sbe24010.htm#fr_169.md) That is, for the
priests. The Parsi-Persian version divides these good works into nine
items, by counting next-of-kin marriage' as the third, and providing of
lodging' as the seventh. For a fuller detail of good works, see Chap.
XXXVII.
