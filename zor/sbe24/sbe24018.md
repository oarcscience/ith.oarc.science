### CHAPTER XII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Wherefore is *it*
when the treasure of the spiritual *existence* is allotted so truly,
*and* that of the worldly *existence* so falsely?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'The treasure of the worldly
*existence* was <span id="fr_210"></span>[2](#fn_207) allotted as truly,
in the original creation, as that of the spiritual *existence*. 5. And
the creator, Aûha*r*ma*zd*, provided the

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

happiness of every kind, that is in these creatures and creation, for
the use (bûn) of the sun <span id="fr_211"></span>[1](#fn_208) and moon
and those twelve constellations which are called the twelve
chieftains <span id="fr_212"></span>[2](#fn_209) by revelation; (6) and
they, too, accepted *it* in order to allot *it* truly and deservedly.

7\. 'And, afterwards, Aharman produced those seven planets, such as are
called the seven chieftains of Aharman, for dissipating <span
id="fr_213"></span>[3](#fn_210) *and* carrying off that happiness from
the creatures of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, in opposition to the sun and moon and
those twelve constellations. 8. And *as to* every happiness which
those-constellations bestow on the creatures of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, (9) those
planets take away as much of it as *it* is possible for them (the
constellations) to give <span id="fr_214"></span>[4](#fn_211), (10) and
give *it* up to the power of the demons <span
id="fr_215"></span>[5](#fn_212) and fiends and the bad.

11\. 'And the treasure of the spiritual *existence* is so true on this
account, because Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the lord, with all the angels *and*
archangels, is <span id="fr_216"></span>[6](#fn_213) undisturbed, (12)
and they make the struggle with Aharman and the demons, and also the
account of the souls of men, with justice. 13. And the place of *him*
whose good work is more is in heaven, (14) the place of *him* whose good
work and sin are equal is among the ever-stationary <span
id="fr_217"></span>[7](#fn_214), (15) and when the crime is more, his
path is then to hell.'
