<p>1. The twenty-fifth subject is this, that any agreement and promise (qa&ucirc;l) they make with any one it is necessary so far to perform and bring to pass. 2. Although many things <I>may</I> go&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1238"></A><A HREF="#fn_1228"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> to harm by means (sabab) of it, it is not desirable to perform that agreement with duplicity.</p>  
<p>3. Because, in our religion, they call this a Mihir-dru<I>g</I> ('breach of promise'), <I>and</I> in revelation it decrees, <I>as to</I> any one <I>who</I> commits a Mihir-dru<I>g</I>, that the way <I>to</I> heaven becomes closed for him, and that person himself goes discomforted out of this world, so that a warning (&#146;hal&acirc;mat) becomes quite manifest unto him.</p>  
<p>4. And a Mihir-dru<I>g</I> is attached&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1239"></A><A HREF="#fn_1229"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> <I>in</I> such a manner that, <I>if</I> fortune (<I>t</I>&acirc;li&#146;h) may have befallen any one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1240"></A><A HREF="#fn_1230"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>

<p>happily, or an insufficient quantity of his life (&#146;humr) may have remained, the Mihir-dru<I>g</I> extends to his children without opposition (&#145;<I>h</I>il&acirc;f). 5. And every household that becomes extinct, or race whose issue fails, or <I>any of</I> the great misfortunes that happen to mankind&#151;from which misfortune <I>one</I> obtains release with difficulty&#151;may all be owing to the <I>fact</I> that they have committed a Mihir-dru<I>g</I>.</p>  
<p>6. If <I>committed by</I> oneself, it is declared, <I>in</I> one place in revelation, that the glorified Zaratu<I>s</I>t, the Spitam&acirc;n, enquired of H&ocirc;rmazd, the good <I>and</I> propitious, thus: 'Of any of the sins that mankind commit which is the worst?' 7. H&ocirc;rmazd, the good <I>and</I> propitious, decreed thus: 'No sin whatever is worse than this, that two persons make a covenant with one another <I>in</I> such a manner that no one whatever is between them, except me who am H&ocirc;rmazd; <I>and</I>, afterwards one of those two persons deviates <I>from it</I>, and says, "I have no knowledge (&#145;<I>h</I>abar) <I>of it</I>," and no one whatever is a witness, for that <I>other</I> person, except me.' 8. No sin whatever is worse than that, and that person himself <I>will</I> not go out of this world until retribution overtakes him, and in that <I>other</I> world his punishment is more severe than all; <I>so</I> that person becomes unfortunate <I>in</I> both worlds. 9. And it is the same <I>if</I> this covenant <I>be</I> with a righteous <I>person or</I> a wicked <I>one</I>.</p>
