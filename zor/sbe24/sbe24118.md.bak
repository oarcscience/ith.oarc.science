### CHAPTER XXX.

1\. The thirtieth subject is this, that it is not proper to pour *away*
water at night, especially from the northern side (*g*ânib) which would
be the worst <span id="fr_1257"></span>[1](#fn_1247.md). 2. Therefore, if
it become a necessity in the end (ba-‘*h*atam) <span
id="fr_1258"></span>[2](#fn_1248.md), it is requisite to recite one
Yathâ-ahû-vairyô <span id="fr_1259"></span>[3](#fn_1249.md), and, *when*
they make a light ready (‘hâʓ̣ir) <span
id="fr_1260"></span>[4](#fn_1250.md), to pour *away* the water gently.

3\. *In* like manner it is not proper to swallow water at night, because
it is a sin. 4. *But*, if a necessity arises, it is necessary to make a
light ready, and *one* first eats some morsels of food (*t*a’hâm) so
that the sin may be less.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1247"></span>[292:1](sbe24118.htm#fr_1257.md) Lp has 'side it
would be,' to which B29 adds 'bold.' The reason of the impropriety is
that the demons are supposed to come from the north, and anything thrown
out northwards might be of use to them (see Sls. X, 7, XII, 18, 19).

<span id="fn_1248"></span>[292:2](sbe24118.htm#fr_1258.md) B29 has
'necessity to pour.'

<span id="fn_1249"></span>[292:3](sbe24118.htm#fr_1259.md) See Mkh. XXVII,
70 n.

<span id="fn_1250"></span>[292:4](sbe24118.htm#fr_1260.md) Lp, B29 omit
these seven words. Both the recitation and light are supposed to
frighten away any demons.
