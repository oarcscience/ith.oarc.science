### CHAPTER XXXII.

1\. The thirty-second subject is this, that, when a hen utters a crow in
a house, or the cock crows. unseasonably, it is desirable that they do
not kill it <span id="fr_1261"></span>[1](#fn_1251.md), and do not consider
*it* a bad habit (fa’hl). 2. Because it is uttering that crow *for* the
reason that a fiend has found a way into that house, and the hen or the
cock, *alone*, does not possess the power (*t*âqat) that *would* keep
the fiend away from that house, and the hen is going to give the cock
assistance, and utters the crow. 3. Therefore, if any time the chance
(ittifâq) happens in that manner, it is requisite to bring another cock,
so that they

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

*may* drive away that fiend through the assistance of one another. 4.
And if a cock crows unseasonably it is likewise not desirable to kill
*it*, because the reason may be this which I have stated.

5\. For it is declared in the good religion, that there is a fiend whom
they call Sê*g* <span id="fr_1262"></span>[1](#fn_1252.md), *and*, in every
house *where* an infant exists, that *fiend* strives that she *may*
cause some misfortune to come upon that house. 6. *So* it is necessary
that they *should* keep a cock *on* the watch for her, so that it *may*
smite that fiend and force *her* to the road *away* from that house.
