### CHAPTER XII.

1\. Again, about the inconsistency of their assertions *there* are
several statements from the Dînka*rd* <span
id="fr_901"></span>[2](#fn_893.md)

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

manuscript, (2) *as to* that which they say, that the sacred being is
around everything, *but* nothing is within him; (3) and within
everything, *but* nothing is around him. 4. *That he* is above
everything, *but* nothing is below him; (5) and below everything, *but*
nothing is above him. 6. *That* he sits upon a throne, *but* is
possessing no *resting-*place; (7) and is inside heaven, *but* is
possessing no whereabouts. 8. *That* he does not exist in any place, and
*yet* he does exist *there*. 9. *That* he exists everywhere, and *yet*
his place does not exist. 10. Also *that* everything of his becomes
*fit* for his own by his own will, (11) *his* original evolution *being
both* malice and good; (12) and *he is* eternally unforgiving and
compassionate, (13) preparing distress and not distressing. 14. Likewise
*that* he *has* commanded him who is incapable of performing *or*
neglecting the divine command, (15) and he *has* created him who is
innocent for hell, not the distresser. 16. *That he is* aware of the
hellish existence of mankind, owing to wickedness, and his will is for
it; (17) and *he is* good-willed, or it *has* become not his will. 18.
*That* he *has* produced a remedy, and is not himself distressing; (19)
or no remedy, but want of remedy, is produced by him, *and yet he is*
not possessing an opponent. 20. *That he is* wanting experience, and
*yet* omniscient; (21) neglecting commands, and *yet*

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

*they are* themselves his will; (22) and he who neglects, *and* provides
a restricted evolution <span id="fr_902"></span>[1](#fn_894.md), is *yet* a
good sovereign. 23. Also *that* his commands are all continuous, (24)
and *yet* the setting aside of his commands is obtainable. 25. And
*that* there is *some* of his will which is not continuous, (26) and
neglect of his will is not an injurer of the will. 27. Likewise *that*
he *has* commanded that which is not his will, (28) and the command
*which is* not inconsistent with his will *and* also the command *which
is* inconsistent with his will are both proper. 29. Also *that* his good
will is not a discontinuous will, (30) and *as to* his evil will, which
makes evil things, that is judicious. 31. And many other inconsistencies
which are in the assertions of *various* sects.

32\. If it be not possible for an orderly (pa*d*mânîk) religion to
exist, without rescue from these inconsistent assertions of many kinds,
(33) they then <span id="fr_903"></span>[2](#fn_895.md) say this of it,
that *to* the supposers of two original evolutions <span
id="fr_904"></span>[3](#fn_896.md) the work of the sacred being is weak and
unresisting; (34) *and* they say *it* is not as *it were* adapted to the
grandeur of the sacred being.

35\. Upon this subject, too, there are *some matters*, which I *shall*
clearly state, *that* should be dictated *and* known. 36. That is, does
he <span id="fr_905"></span>[4](#fn_897.md) make divine things weaker and
more unresisting, (37) where *it is he* who says that *the sacred
being's* own achievements,

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

which *were* created by him, have all lapsed into *being* intolerant of
command *and* deaf to admonition, (38) till even the most tender-bodied
creatures struggle against his will? 39. And so *they have* slain *or*
impaled those many prophets (vakhshvarân) *and* apostles (pêtkhambarân)
of his, who are appointed by him; (40) *and* there are *some* who *have*
acted scornfully, contemptibly, and irreverently. 41. This, too, is
where *he has* not only not protected his own dominion from the vile
*creatures* which *were* created by him himself, but *he has* himself
afflicted his own dominion also; (42) and he himself destroys his own
productions without a reason, (43) and himself renders his own creations
useless. 44. Through his own culpability he himself destroys his own
innocent servants. 45. He himself makes his own peculiar friends weak,
needy, sinful, and deluded. 46. And *his* wrath, *inflicted* upon a
single innocent servant, which is like Aharman's <span
id="fr_906"></span>[1](#fn_898.md), makes his own innumerable creatures
unobservant *and* deluded. 47. For a sin that is limited, which is owing
to his own actions, he puts the innocent to unlimited punishment <span
id="fr_907"></span>[2](#fn_899.md). 48. The door of forgiveness is finally
shut up, (49) and he is not satiated with the pain, distress, and misery
of his own creatures, (50) *but* maintains *them* perpetually in action
and excitement. 51. And *yet* he is not able to insist upon the commands
which he

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

gives *in* the beginning, middle, *or* end. 52. Or is *it* he <span
id="fr_908"></span>[1](#fn_900.md) who says that that *one* is the sacred
being who is perpetually a ruler, all-knowing and almighty; (53) whose
dominion and knowledge and power are perpetual *and* for unlimited time?
54. Owing to him, too, is the happiness of any goodness; (55) his
actions also are for a purpose, *his* commands are advantageous, (56)
*he is* compassionate and forgiving as regards his own servants, (57)
and is an abundant bestower of recompense, too, *on* that servant who is
a carrier *off* of victory. 58. As to him who is a sinner, who, on
account of his own sinfulness, becomes captive *in* the hands of the
enemy <span id="fr_909"></span>[2](#fn_901.md), *he is* forgiving upon
atonement *for* the sinfulness and cleansing from iniquity and
pollution. 59. *In* the end *he* is no leaver of any good creature
captive in the hands of enemies <span id="fr_910"></span>[3](#fn_902.md),
(60) and is heir protector, maintainer, and cherisher, in body and life,
amid *their* contest and struggle with enemies. 61. *He is* a complete
defender of his own empire from opponents of a different nature, (62)
and his champions and troops become victorious in the struggle and
contest. 63. *And* in the end *he is* a bringer of victory *to* his own
creatures, as regards every iniquity.

64\. When it is observed *as* to light, knowledge, sight, life, health,
*and* other divine creations, that *they* are fully resistant and
prevailing over darkness,

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

ignorance, blindness, death, sickness, *and* other demoniacal
peculiarities—(65) because this is known, that light is the putting
aside of all darkness, (66) knowledge is victorious over ignorance, (67)
and life is powerful <span id="fr_911"></span>[1](#fn_903.md) and
increasing over death, (68) for, owing to the powerfulness and increase
of life, the incalculable progress of the creatures arises from two
persons, (69) and multitudes are confident about it; (70) so also sight
and health are manifestly as much victorious and powerful over blindness
and sickness —(71) *such being observed*, it is also expedient to
observe this, that is, what does the opposing fiend want, *and* about
what do the troops of the sacred being struggle?

72\. That opponent wants this *that he speaks of* thus: 'I *will* make
this earth and sky and the creatures which are luminaries <span
id="fr_912"></span>[2](#fn_904) extinct, (73.md) or I *will* bring *them*
into *my* possession, *and will* pervert *them* from their own
nature <span id="fr_913"></span>[3](#fn_905), (74.md) so that the sacred
being shall not be able to occasion the resurrection and the renovation
*of the universe*, and to restore his own creatures.'

75\. The troops of the sacred being struggle about this, that the
opponent shall not attain to *his* will through *his* desire. 76.
*Observe* this, too, that the troops of Aûha*r*ma*zd* *have been*
valiant in struggling and successful in will *ever* since the original
creation.

77\. From this *it* is manifest, when it happens *that* this earth and
sky are formed, (78) that it *would be* possible for him to make all
creatures and creations extinct; but *he* is incapable of making even
one of the most tender-bodied creatures of the sacred being

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

extinct. 79. Because, if even, by reason of death, the body be separated
from life, *it* is not extinction and change of nature from its own
self, but decay <span id="fr_914"></span>[1](#fn_906.md) of peculiarities
and a necessity of *going* from place to place, from duty to duty <span
id="fr_915"></span>[2](#fn_907.md). 80. Then each one of the qualities of
one's body *and* life is to subsist again, in its own nature, for other
duties, as is revealed. 81. And the existence of these creatures and
creation, fully continuously *and* perpetually active, is advantageously
manifest during a suitable period.

82\. Thus far is considered complete upon this subject.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_893"></span>[202:2](sbe24082.htm#fr_901.md) See Chap. IV, 407.
As the inconsistent statements which <span id="page_203">p. 203</span>
follow in the text are not to be found in the portion of the Dînka*rd*
known to be extant, they were probably contained in the first two books
of that work, which have not yet been discovered. Chap. 132 of the third
book (130 in Dastûr Peshotan's translation, pp. 176-178) is the nearest
approach to our text in style, but not in matter. It is 'about him who
is in all *and* over all, over and not lower than anything *nor* through
anything, that is, even owing to management *he is* over all, and all is
manageable by him.'

<span id="fn_894"></span>[204:1](sbe24082.htm#fr_902.md) Reading
bandak-ga*s*tîh instead of Pâz. ba*n*daya*s*tî; compare Chap. IV, 73 n.

<span id="fn_895"></span>[204:2](sbe24082.htm#fr_903.md) Reading adîna*s*,
'then of it,' for Pâz. ainâ, as in Chap. IV, 81.

<span id="fn_896"></span>[204:3](sbe24082.htm#fr_904.md) That is, those who
hold the orthodox Ma*zd*a-worshipper's opinion, that the producer of
evil is independent of the producer of good, so long as the former
continues to exist.

<span id="fn_897"></span>[204:4](sbe24082.htm#fr_905.md) The believer in a
single original evolution without any independent producer of evil.
Connect §§ 36, 37 with §§ 52, 53.

<span id="fn_898"></span>[205:1](sbe24082.htm#fr_906.md) Aharman being
supposed to be the producer of the demon of wrath, who is one of his
most powerful auxiliaries.

<span id="fn_899"></span>[205:2](sbe24082.htm#fr_907.md) Sans. has 'he puts
another unlimited punishment upon the innocent;' Nêr. having read hanŏ,
'another,' instead of avŏ, 'to,' which two words are written alike in
Pahlavi. As the author's interpretation of his opponent's argument
assumes that everything, including sin, is produced by the sacred being,
he naturally concludes that the sinners themselves are innocent.

<span id="fn_900"></span>[206:1](sbe24082.htm#fr_908.md) The believer in
two original evolutions, good and evil; the producer of the latter being
independent of the producer of the former for a limited period of
existence. This producer of evil is not clearly described here, but is
mentioned in §§ 58-61, 72 as an enemy and opponent. §§ 52, 53 are to be
read in connection with §§ 36-38.

<span id="fn_901"></span>[206:2](sbe24082.htm#fr_909.md) The spiritual
enemy, Aharman.

<span id="fn_902"></span>[206:3](sbe24082.htm#fr_910.md) Compare Chap. IV,
100.

<span id="fn_903"></span>[207:1](sbe24082.htm#fr_911.md) Assuming that Pâz.
ava*z*ma*n*d stands for Pahl. ao*g*-hômand.

<span id="fn_904"></span>[207:2](sbe24082.htm#fr_912.md) Sans. has 'of the
luminaries.'

<span id="fn_905"></span>[207:3](sbe24082.htm#fr_913.md) Compare Bd. I, 14.

<span id="fn_906"></span>[208:1](sbe24082.htm#fr_914.md) Assuming that Pâz.
nyâra*s*ni is a misreading of Pahl. nihâri*s*nŏ.

<span id="fn_907"></span>[208:2](sbe24082.htm#fr_915.md) Compare Chap. IV,
87.
