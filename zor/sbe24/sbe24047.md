### CHAPTER XLI

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Which man is the
mightier? 3. Which road is the more dreadful? 4. Which account is the
more

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

perplexing? 5. Which tie <span id="fr_438"></span>[1](#fn_433.md) is the
pleasanter? 6. Which work is the more regretable? 7. And which gift is
the more unprofitable?'

8\. The spirit of wisdom answered (9) thus: 'That man is the mightier
who is able to struggle with his own fiends <span
id="fr_439"></span>[2](#fn_434); (10.md) and, in particular, *he* who keeps
these five fiends far from *his* person, (11) which are such as
greediness, wrath, lust, disgrace, and discontent. 12. The road in
passing over the *K*indvar bridge <span id="fr_440"></span>[3](#fn_435.md)
is the more dreadful. 13. The account for a soul of the wicked is the
more perplexing. 14. The tie of children is the pleasanter and more
desirable. 15. That work is the more regretable which they do for the
ungrateful. 16. *And* that gift is the more unprofitable which they give
to the unworthy <span id="fr_441"></span>[4](#fn_436.md).'
