### CHAPTER LVIII.

1\. The fifty-eighth subject is this, that it is ever necessary that
those of the good religion *should* make an effort that they *may*
celebrate *a ceremony for their* living souls. 2. *For* the soul, *for
which* they have celebrated *a ceremony* <span
id="fr_1379"></span>[3](#fn_1368.md), just as much good work as it then
becomes each year, it is twice as much good work the second year. 3. So
that, *in* this manner, the merit of *the ceremony for* the living soul
is increasing just so much every year, while the man is living. 4. And,
after that, this also occurs, that, if at the time when that person
becomes an immortal soul *there* be no one *at hand*—Srôsh <span
id="fr_1380"></span>[4](#fn_1369.md) *being* the angel when *the ceremony
for* the living soul is celebrated—Srôsh, the righteous, receives the
soul by

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

himself, and is keeping watch *over it* during the three days <span
id="fr_1381"></span>[1](#fn_1370.md), and does not forsake *it*, so that no
danger *or* harm happens to it. 5. And the fourth night he is a helper,
with the angel Rashn <span id="fr_1382"></span>[2](#fn_1371.md) at the
*K*inva*d* bridge, while they make up its account and reckoning, and it
goes *to* its own place.

6\. And this *ceremony for* the living soul is appointed for the reason
that, just in the manner *that*, when an infant becomes separated from
the mother, a midwife (qâbilat) is necessary for it, so that they *may*
keep watch over it, *and* just in the manner that she takes up the
infant <span id="fr_1383"></span>[3](#fn_1372.md) from the ground—and, *at*
the time when it is born, it is ever necessary that *there* be a woman
present (‘hâʓ̣irat), or they *may* perform work *for* the infant at a
time *fit* for the demon—*in* this same manner, when the soul is
becoming separated from the body it is like an infant (*t*ifl), *and*
does not know any way to its place. 7. When they celebrate *a ceremony
for* the living soul, and have propitiated the righteous Srôsh, the
righteous Srôsh becomes like the midwife, so that he receives that soul
by himself, and keeps watch *that it is* out of the hands of Aharman and
the demons. 8. When they do not celebrate *a ceremony* for the soul
*when* living, *but*, after that <span
id="fr_1384"></span>[4](#fn_1373.md), the priests perform *it* before
Srôsh, it is like that *which occurs* when a woman brings forth a
child <span id="fr_1385"></span>[5](#fn_1374.md), *and* after that they set
*her* before the midwife. 9. And it happens that while some one is
coming in, who takes up that child and wraps *it* up, it has perished.

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

10\. Therefore, as she does the needful which they *should* do earlier
by the hand of some one, *in* this same manner it makes *it* incumbent
on every one to celebrate *a ceremony for* his own living soul, so that
it *may* be free (îman) from these misfortunes. 11. *And* <span
id="fr_1386"></span>[1](#fn_1375.md) that, if his decease occurs *in* any
place where *there* may be no one who *will* celebrate *a ceremony for*
his soul, since *a ceremony for* the living soul is celebrated, *there*
are no arrears for him, and he is free. 12. And, in many things, it is
that *ceremony for the* living soul which is expedient, especially in
these times when the priests have remained few *in* number; *and*, when
it is celebrated by one's own hands, it is a great duty.
