### CHAPTER XCVI.

1\. The ninety-sixth subject is this, when any one departs to that
*other* world it is not proper for others that they *should* utter an
outcry, maintain grief, *and* make lamentation *and* weeping. 2. Because
every tear *that* issues *from* the eyes becomes one *drop* of that
river <span id="fr_1578"></span>[5](#fn_1567.md) before the *K*inva*d*

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

bridge, *and* then the soul of that dead *person* remains *at* that
place; it is difficult for it to make a passage there, and it is not
able to pass over the *K*inva*d* bridge. 3. It is therefore necessary
that they recite the Avesta and celebrate the ceremonial, so that the
passage of that place *may* become easy for it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1567"></span>[358:5](sbe24184.htm#fr_1578.md) 'This river is
the many tears that men shed from *their* eyes, as they make lamentation
and weeping for the departed. They shed those tears unlawfully, and they
swell to this river. Those who are not able to cross over are those for
whom, after their departure, <span id="page_359">p. 359</span> much
lamentation and weeping were made; and those *who cross* more easily are
those for whom less was made' (AV. XVI, 7-10).
