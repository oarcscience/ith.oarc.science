### CHAPTER XIX.

1\. The nineteenth subject is this, that the performance of agriculture
is like that when some one is performing the ceremonial of the sacred
beings, and it is necessary to maintain much respect for agriculturists;
it is also necessary to keep trouble and strife far from them.

2 For it is declared in revelation, that, as to every one who replants a
shrub, while that shrub or tree exists at the place, every good work
that every one, who eats of that shrub, does in that state of repletion
becomes the agriculturist's, just like those which are done by his own
hand. 3. If any one orders it, just as that good work occurs <span
id="fr_1206"></span>[1](#fn_1197) much new repose (râ‘hat) and comfort
reach his soul <span id="fr_1207"></span>[2](#fn_1198). 4. As to corn
and grain (‘hubûb) and whatever they sow, it is just like this <span
id="fr_1208"></span>[3](#fn_1199), because, as regards every one who
eats wheat, barley, and other grains, and performs duty and good works,
they become those of the sower of <span
id="fr_1209"></span>[4](#fn_1200) those grains, just as those which are
performed by his own hand. 5. Because, for the life of mankind a crop
was necessary, the creation of a

creator <span id="fr_1210"></span>[1](#fn_1201) after the sacred being,
the most high <span id="fr_1211"></span>[2](#fn_1202), owing to the work
of the agriculturist. 6. For every one who eats anything dies,
therefore, *as regards* that person by whose work the life of mankind is
established, it is necessary to consider him valuable and precious.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1197"></span>[281:1](sbe24107.htm#fr_1206) Lp, B29 have 'is
performed.'

<span id="fn_1198"></span>[281:2](sbe24107.htm#fr_1207) Lp, B29 add
'therefrom.'

<span id="fn_1199"></span>[281:3](sbe24107.htm#fr_1208) B29 adds 'way.'

<span id="fn_1200"></span>[281:4](sbe24107.htm#fr_1209) La omits the
rest of this chapter, as well as the words 'they become,' by mistake.

<span id="fn_1201"></span>[282:1](sbe24107.htm#fr_1210) B29, J15 omit
these five words.

<span id="fn_1202"></span>[282:2](sbe24107.htm#fr_1211) J15 has 'after
its creation by the sacred being, the creator.' The alteration of this
sentence, in B29 and J15, seems due to their writers’ reluctance to
attribute the power of creating, even figuratively, to the mere producer
of a crop.
