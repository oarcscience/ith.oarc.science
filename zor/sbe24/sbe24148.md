### CHAPTER LX.

1\. The sixtieth subject is this, that we are keeping the good *and*
pure religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers with us <span
id="fr_1391"></span>[2](#fn_1380), so that escape from hell *may* be
possible for our souls <span id="fr_1392"></span>[3](#fn_1381). 2. And
we are completely united in hope, and through investigation (ta‘hqîq) we
fully understand that, when we are steadfast in the good religion, we
arrive in heaven. 3. And we know that arrival in heaven occurs through
virtuous actions, and through them we are saved; so that we think of
good <span id="fr_1393"></span>[4](#fn_1382), speak of good, and do
good.

4\. And no doing of good is better than that which *offers itself* when
a difficult duty comes before one of the good religion as his soul
wishes to depart. 5. Since it comes to thee, do thou give help *to* that
which has escaped *his* hand, so that he *may* come out of that
hindrance; and do thou not forsake *him*

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

so that he relinquishes the religion. 6. For after that, while he is in
the religion, *and* while his children, after him, are in the
religion <span id="fr_1394"></span>[1](#fn_1383), every duty and good
work that he does—and *his* children—is just like those which are done
by *thine* own hand.

7\. And *it is* just like that with regard to poll-tax, it is also
indispensable to give *it* in semblance of help, so that they *may* give
that person *his* release (‘*h*alâʓ), and he *may* stay in his own
place, *and* the advantage of a good work (THavâb) *may* come to that
*other person*.
