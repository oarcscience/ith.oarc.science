### CHAPTER XCI.

1\. The ninety-first subject is this, that is, *in* what mode is it
necessary to wash everything that becomes polluted by dead matter?

2\. Gold *one is* to wash over once with *ceremonial* ablution <span
id="fr_1556"></span>[3](#fn_1545) to make *it* dry once with dust, and
to wash *it* over once with water. 3. Silver (nuqrah) *one is to do*
twice; copper, tin, lead, and brass *articles* three times; steel four
times; stone *articles* six times; turquoise, ruby (yâqût), amber,
carbuncle, cornelian (’haqîq), and, like these, whatever is from a mine
(ma’hdan) are all to be washed six times in the manner which I have
stated. 4. Afterwards they are clean *in* that manner, when every single
time *one* washes them over with *ceremonial* ablution, makes

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

*them* dry with dust, and washes *it* off <span
id="fr_1557"></span>[1](#fn_1546); and just like this *on* the occasion
of the other times—up to three times, or four, or six—as far as whatever
is ordered.

5\. For pearls two modes <span id="fr_1558"></span>[2](#fn_1547) are
ordered, but the conclusion is this, that they *should* wash *them* six
times, just like stone *articles*. 6. The whole of wooden and earthen
*ware* it is requisite to throw *away*. 7. All clothing of the body it
is requisite to wash six times *in* the manner that I have stated,
*and*, after that, to put *them* in a place where the sun and moon must
*shine* on them *for* six months <span
id="fr_1559"></span>[3](#fn_1548); after that they are fit for a
menstruous woman.
