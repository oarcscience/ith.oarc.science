### CHAPTER XLVII.

1\. The forty-seventh subject is this, that, when a child of seven years
shall die, an order is necessary *that* it is requisite to perform a
ceremony (ya*s*t) *for* Srôsh <span id="fr_1337"></span>[1](#fn_1326.md) on
account of it, *and* to consecrate the sacred cake of the fourth
night <span id="fr_1338"></span>[2](#fn_1327.md).

2\. For it says in revelation that the souls of children go with the
souls of *their* fathers and mothers; if the father is *fit* for heaven
*the child* goes to heaven with him, if he be *fit* for hell it arrives
in hell; if the mother be *fit* for heaven it reaches heaven with her,
if she be *fit* for hell it reaches hell with her <span
id="fr_1339"></span>[3](#fn_1328.md).

3\. Therefore, every time that they accomplish the ceremony *for* Srôsh,
the soul of that child becomes separated from the souls of *its* father
and mother, and goes to heaven, and is imploring intercession
(*s*ifâ’hat) for *its* father and mother in the presence of the sacred
beings in that *other* world.
