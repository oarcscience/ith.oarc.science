### CHAPTER LIV.

1\. The fifty-fourth subject is this, that if any one has a serving
wife <span id="fr_1364"></span>[2](#fn_1353.md), *and* if the acquisition
of a male child results <span id="fr_1365"></span>[3](#fn_1354.md) from
her, it is suitable for adoption *by* that person <span
id="fr_1366"></span>[4](#fn_1355.md), and the bridge <span
id="fr_1367"></span>[5](#fn_1356.md) is not severed *for* that person. 2.
*But* if it be a female *child* it is necessary that the man *should*
not be negligent (*gh*âfil) in appointing an adopted son for his own
sake. 3. He *should* himself appoint a son of some relation, *who is* a
friend of the soul, so that the bridge may not be severed *for* his
soul.
