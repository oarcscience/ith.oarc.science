### CHAPTER VI.

1\. The sixth subject is this, that of the many good works there are
those which, when they accomplish *them*, obtain great (’ha*th*îm)
rewards; *and* if *one* does not perform *them* severe punishment seizes
upon *one* at the head of the *K*inva*d* bridge <span
id="fr_1119"></span>[1](#fn_1111.md). 2. One is *the celebration of* the
season festivals <span id="fr_1120"></span>[2](#fn_1112.md); the second is
keeping *the days of* the guardian spirits <span
id="fr_1121"></span>[3](#fn_1113.md); the third is *attending to* the souls
of fathers, mothers, *and* other relations <span
id="fr_1122"></span>[4](#fn_1114.md); the fourth is *reciting* the
Khûrshê*d* Nyâyi*s* <span id="fr_1123"></span>[5](#fn_1115.md) three times
every day; the fifth is *reciting* the Mâh Nyâyi*s* <span
id="fr_1124"></span>[6](#fn_1116.md) three times every month, once when it
becomes new, once when it becomes full, and once when it becomes
slender <span id="fr_1125"></span>[7](#fn_1117.md); *and* the sixth is
celebrating the Rapithwin <span id="fr_1126"></span>[8](#fn_1118.md)
*ceremony* once every year. 3. If not able to celebrate *them* oneself,
it is requisite to order *them*, so that they *may* celebrate them every
single time <span id="fr_1127"></span>[9](#fn_1119.md).

4\. These six good works are things indispensable unto every one. 5.
When any one *of them* is not *performed*—be it that which, if omitted
at its own time <span id="fr_1128"></span>[10](#fn_1120.md), it is not
possible to accomplish, or if it be that one time *one* omits an
occasion, *and* another time <span id="fr_1129"></span>[11](#fn_1121.md)
they accomplish twice as much—*one should* consider <span
id="fr_1130"></span>[12](#fn_1122.md) that as an advantage, *which* occurs
in retribution

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

for it, or *as* atonement for the transgression. 6. Because they call
the transgression of each of these six a bridge-sin; that is, every one
*through* whom a transgression of these may have arisen they keep back,
at the head of the *K*inva*d* bridge, till punishment for it happens to
him, and no good work is possible <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[1](#fn_1123.md) in this place, which is torment and
punishment for him <span id="fr_1132"></span>[2](#fn_1124.md).

7\. Therefore it is necessary to make an effort, that they *may* be
performed each one at its own time, so that they *may* obtain a
recompense, *and* not a severe punishment.
