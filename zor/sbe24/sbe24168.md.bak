### CHAPTER LXXX.

1\. The eightieth subject is this, that there is a time when thou
recitest one Ashem-vohû <span id="fr_1502"></span>[3](#fn_1491.md), *and*
the merit of it may be as much as *that of* ten. 2. There is a time when
thou recitest one Ashem-vohû, *and* the merit of it may be as much as
*that of* a hundred. 3. A time may be when thou recitest one <span
id="fr_1503"></span>[4](#fn_1492.md), *and* the merit of it may be as much
as *that of* a thousand. 4. A time may be when the merit of one
Ashem-vohû <span id="fr_1504"></span>[5](#fn_1493.md) may be as much as
*that of* ten thousand. 5.

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> A time may be when
the merit of one Ashem-vohû is as much as the value (qîmat) <span
id="fr_1505"></span>[1](#fn_1494.md) of this world and that *other*
world <span id="fr_1506"></span>[2](#fn_1495.md).

6\. As for that Ashem-vohû whose nature <span
id="fr_1507"></span>[3](#fn_1496.md) is as much as ten, that is when they
recite *it* as they eat bread. 7. That which is, from nature, as much as
a hundred is when they recite *it* after eating <span
id="fr_1508"></span>[4](#fn_1497.md). 8. That which is so much by nature
that, *having* turned side over side, they recite *it* correctly may be
a merit of a thousand <span id="fr_1509"></span>[5](#fn_1498.md). 9. That
which is of the nature of ten thousand is that which thou recitest when
thou risest up from sleep <span id="fr_1510"></span>[6](#fn_1499.md). 10.
And that whose nature is as much as this world and that *other*
world <span id="fr_1511"></span>[7](#fn_1500.md) is when they recite *it*
at the time of the dissolution of life; for, if he be not able to recite
*it* himself, friends and relations give *it* into his mouth. 11 <span
id="fr_1512"></span>[8](#fn_1501.md). If he be fit for hell he becomes fit
for the ever-stationary, if he be fit for the ever-stationary he becomes
fit for heaven, *and* if he be fit for heaven he becomes fit for the
supreme heaven <span id="fr_1513"></span>[9](#fn_1502.md).
