### VIII. TÎR YA*S*T.

Ti*s*trya is the leader of the stars against the planets, as stars and
planets belong, respectively, to the worlds of Ahura Mazda and Angra
Mainyu (Vend. Introd. IV, 36; Bund. II, 5 seq.).

This Ya*s*t is a description of the production of the rain through the
agency of the star Ti*s*trya. It has to struggle against the Daêva of
Drought, Apaosha, is first overcome and conquers at last. This seems to
be a refacimento of the old storm myths, which have been in so far
renewed as the role of the hero in the original myth has been
transferred to a star. It is to be noticed, however, that Apaosha is not
described as a planet.

Ti*s*trya is Sirius <span id="fr_476"></span>[1](#fn_455.md). It presides
over the first month of summer (21 June-21 July). This Ya*s*t appears
thus to have been written in a part of Iran where the dog-days must have
fallen in July, and the rainy season began in the last days of July,
unless the place of Ti*s*trya in the calendar has been changed at some
later period.

This Ya*s*t is recited on the days of Ti*s*trya, Haurvatâ*t* (as the
Genius of Waters), Farvardîn (as the Fravashis are his allies in the
struggle; § 34), and Bâd (the wind; § 32).

The struggle between Ti*s*trya and Apaosha is described in the
Bundahi*s* (VII), but it has there a cosmological character: it has not
for its object the annual and regular return of the rains after the
dog-days, but the production of the seas and lakes in the first ages of
the world.

0\. May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced! . . . .

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathu*s*tra, one
who hates the Daêvas and obeys the laws of Ahura;

For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto \[Hâvani\],
the holy and master of holiness . . . .

Unto Ti*s*trya, the bright and glorious star, and unto the powerful
Satavaêsa, made by Mazda, who pushes waters forward <span
id="fr_477"></span>[2](#fn_456.md),

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and
glorification.

Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . .

#### I.

1\. Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathu*s*tra, saying: 'We worship
the lordship and mastership \[of Ti*s*trya\], whereby he protects <span
id="fr_478"></span>[1](#fn_457.md) the Moon, the dwelling, the food, when
my glorious stars come along and impart their gifts <span
id="fr_479"></span>[2](#fn_458.md) to men. I will sacrifice unto the star
Ti*s*trya, that gives the fields their share \[of waters\].

2\. 'We offer up libations unto Ti*s*trya, the bright and glorious star,
that gives happy dwelling and good dwelling; the white, shining, seen
afar, and piercing; the health-bringing, loud-snorting <span
id="fr_480"></span>[3](#fn_459.md), and high, piercing from afar with its
shining, undefiled rays; and unto the waters of the wide sea, the
Vanguhi of wide renown <span id="fr_481"></span>[4](#fn_460.md), and the
species <span id="fr_482"></span>[5](#fn_461.md) of the Bull, made by
Mazda, the awful kingly Glory, and the Fravashi of the holy Spitama
Zarathu*s*tra.

3\. 'For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice
worth being heard, namely, unto the star Ti*s*trya.

'Unto Ti*s*trya, the bright and glorious star, we offer up the
libations, the Haoma and meat, the baresma, the wisdom of the tongue,
the holy spells, the speech, the deeds, the libations, and the
rightly-spoken words <span id="fr_483"></span>[6](#fn_462.md).

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

'Yê*n*hê hâtãm: All those beings of whom Ahura Mazda . . . .

#### II.

4\. 'We sacrifice unto Ti*s*trya, the bright and glorious star, who is
the seed of the waters, powerful, tall, and strong, whose light goes
afar; powerful and highly <span id="fr_484"></span>[1](#fn_463.md) working,
through whom the brightness and the seed of the waters come from the
high Apãm Napâ*t* <span id="fr_485"></span>[2](#fn_464.md).

'For his brightness and glory, I will offer him a sacrifice worth being
heard . . . .

#### III.

5\. 'We sacrifice unto Ti*s*trya, the bright and glorious star; for whom
long <span id="fr_486"></span>[3](#fn_465.md) flocks and herds and men,
looking forward for him and deceived in their hope <span
id="fr_487"></span>[4](#fn_466.md): "When shall we see him rise up, the
bright and glorious star Ti*s*trya? When will the springs run with waves
as thick as a horse's size and still thicker? Or will they never come?"

'For his brightness and glory, I will offer him a sacrifice worth being
heard . . . .

#### IV.

6\. 'We sacrifice unto Ti*s*trya, the bright and glorious star; who
flies, towards the sea Vouru-Kasha <span
id="fr_488"></span>[5](#fn_467.md), as swiftly as the arrow darted through
the heavenly

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

space <span id="fr_489"></span>[1](#fn_468.md), which Erekhsha <span
id="fr_490"></span>[2](#fn_469.md), the swift archer, the Arya amongst the
Aryas whose arrow was the swiftest, shot from Mount Khshaotha to Mount
*Hv*anva*nt* <span id="fr_491"></span>[3](#fn_470.md).

7\. 'For Ahura Mazda gave him assistance; so did the waters and the
plants; and Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, opened a wide way unto
him.

'For his brightness and glory, I will offer him a sacrifice worth being
heard . . . .

#### V.

8\. 'We sacrifice unto Ti*s*trya, the bright and glorious star, that
afflicts the Pairikas, that vexes the Pairikas, who, in the shape of
worm-stars <span id="fr_492"></span>[4](#fn_471.md), fly

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

between the earth and the heavens, in the sea Vouru-Kasha, the powerful
sea, the large-sized, deep sea of salt <span
id="fr_493"></span>[1](#fn_472.md) waters. He goes to its lake in the shape
of a horse, in a holy shape; and down there he makes the waters boil
over, and the winds flow above powerfully all around.

9\. 'Then Satavaêsa <span id="fr_494"></span>[2](#fn_473.md) makes those
waters flow down to the seven Karshvares of the earth <span
id="fr_495"></span>[3](#fn_474.md), and when he has arrived down there, he
stands, beautiful, spreading ease and joy on the fertile countries
(thinking in himself): "How shall the countries of the Aryas grow
fertile?"

'For his brightness and glory, I will offer him a sacrifice worth being
heard . . . .

### VI.

10\. 'We sacrifice unto Ti*s*trya, the bright and glorious star, who
spake unto Ahura Mazda, saying: "Ahura Mazda, most beneficent Spirit,
Maker of the material world, thou Holy One!

11\. ' "If men would worship me with a sacrifice in which I were invoked
by my own name, as they worship the other Yazatas with sacrifices in
which they are invoked by their own names, then I should have come to
the faithful at the appointed time <span
id="fr_496"></span>[4](#fn_475.md);

I should have come in the appointed time of my

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

beautiful, immortal life <span id="fr_497"></span>[1](#fn_476.md), should
it be one night, or two nights, or fifty, or a hundred nights."

12\. 'We sacrifice unto Ti*s*trya;

'We sacrifice unto the rains of Ti*s*trya <span
id="fr_498"></span>[2](#fn_477.md).

'We sacrifice unto the first star <span id="fr_499"></span>[3](#fn_478.md);
we sacrifice unto the rains of the first star.

'I will sacrifice unto the stars Haptôiri*n*ga <span
id="fr_500"></span>[4](#fn_479.md), to oppose the Yâtus and Pairikas.

'We sacrifice unto Vana*nt* <span id="fr_501"></span>[5](#fn_480.md), the
star made by Mazda; for <span id="fr_502"></span>[6](#fn_481.md) the
well-shapen strength, for the Victory, made by Ahura, for the crushing
Ascendant, for the destruction of what distresses us, for the
destruction of what persecutes us.

'We sacrifice unto Ti*s*trya, whose eye-sight is sound <span
id="fr_503"></span>[7](#fn_482.md).

13\. 'For ten nights, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! Ti*s*trya, the bright and
glorious star, mingles his shape

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

with light, moving in the shape of a man of fifteen years of age <span
id="fr_504"></span>[1](#fn_483.md), bright, with clear eyes, tall, full of
strength, strong, and clever.

14\. 'He is active as the first man <span
id="fr_505"></span>[2](#fn_484.md) was; he goes on with the strength of the
first man; he has the virility <span id="fr_506"></span>[3](#fn_485.md) of
the first man.

15 <span id="fr_507"></span>[4](#fn_486.md). 'Here he calls for people to
assemble, here he asks, saying: "Who now will offer me the libations
with the Haoma and the holy meat? To whom shall I give wealth of male
children, a troop of male children, and the purification of his own
soul? Now I ought to receive sacrifice and prayer in the material world,
by the law of excellent holiness."

16\. 'The next ten nights, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! the bright and
glorious Ti*s*trya mingles his shape with light, moving in the shape of
a golden-horned bull <span id="fr_508"></span>[5](#fn_487.md).

17\. 'Here he calls for people to assemble, here he asks, saying: "Who
now will offer me the libations with the Haoma and the holy meat? To
whom shall I give wealth of oxen, a herd of oxen, and the purification
of his own soul? Now I ought to receive sacrifice and prayer in the
material world, by the law of excellent holiness."

18\. 'The next ten nights, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! the bright and
glorious Ti*s*trya mingles his shape with light, moving in the shape of
a white, beautiful horse, with golden ears and a golden caparison.

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

19\. 'Here he calls for people to assemble, here he asks, saying: "Who
now will offer me the libations with the Haoma and the holy meat? To
whom shall I give wealth of horses, a troop of horses, and the
purification of his own soul? Now I ought to receive sacrifice and
prayer in the material world, by the law of excellent holiness."

20\. 'Then, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! the bright and glorious Ti*s*trya
goes down to the sea Vouru-Kasha in the shape of a white, beautiful
horse, with golden ears and a golden caparison <span
id="fr_509"></span>[1](#fn_488.md).

21\. 'But there rushes down to meet him the Daêva Apaosha, in the shape
of a dark horse, black with black ears, black with a black back, black
with a black tail, stamped with brands of terror.

22\. 'They meet together, hoof against hoof, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra!
the bright and glorious Ti*s*trya and the Daêva Apaosha. They fight
together, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! for three days and three nights. And
then the Daêva Apaosha proves stronger than the bright and glorious
Ti*s*trya, he overcomes him.

23\. 'And Ti*s*trya flees from the sea Vouru-Kasha, as far as a
Hâthrâ's <span id="fr_510"></span>[2](#fn_489.md) length. He cries out in
woe and distress, the bright and glorious Ti*s*trya: "Woe is me, O Ahura
Mazda! I am in distress, O Waters and Plants! O Fate and thou, Law of
the worshippers of Mazda! Men do not worship me with a

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

sacrifice in which I am invoked by my own name, as they worship the
other Yazatas with sacrifices in which they are invoked by their own
names <span id="fr_511"></span>[1](#fn_490.md).

24\. ' "If men had worshipped me with a sacrifice in which I had been
invoked by my own name, as they worship the other Yazatas with
sacrifices in which they are invoked by their own names, I should have
taken to me the strength of ten horses, the strength of ten camels, the
strength of ten bulls, the strength of ten mountains, the strength of
ten rivers <span id="fr_512"></span>[2](#fn_491.md)."

25\. 'Then I, Ahura Mazda, offer up to the bright and glorious Ti*s*trya
a sacrifice in which he is invoked by his own name, and I bring him the
strength of ten horses, the strength of ten camels, the strength of ten
bulls, the strength of ten mountains, the strength of ten rivers.

26 <span id="fr_513"></span>[3](#fn_492.md). 'Then, O Spitama
Zarathu*s*tra! the bright and glorious Ti*s*trya goes down to the sea
Vouru-Kasha in the shape of a white, beautiful horse, with golden ears
and golden caparison.

27\. 'But there rushes down to meet him the Daêva Apaosha in the shape
of a dark horse, black with black ears, black with a black back, black
with a black tail, stamped with brands of terror.

28\. 'They meet together, hoof against hoof, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra!
the bright and glorious Ti*s*trya, and the Daêva Apaosha; they fight
together, O Zarathu*s*tra! till the time of noon. Then the bright and
glorious Ti*s*trya proves stronger than the Daêva Apaosha, he overcomes
him.

29\. 'Then he goes from the sea Vouru-Kasha as far as a Hâthra's length:
"Hail!" cries the

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

bright and glorious Ti*s*trya. "Hail unto me, O Ahura Mazda! Hail unto
you, O waters and plants! Hail, O Law of the worshippers of Mazda! Hail
will it be unto you, O lands! The life <span
id="fr_514"></span>[1](#fn_493.md) of the waters will flow down
unrestrained to the big-seeded <span id="fr_515"></span>[2](#fn_494.md)
cornfields, to the small-seeded <span id="fr_516"></span>[3](#fn_495.md)
pasture-fields, and to the whole of the material world!"

30\. 'Then the bright and glorious Ti*s*trya goes back down to the sea
Vouru-Kasha, in the shape of a white, beautiful horse, with golden ears
and a golden caparison <span id="fr_517"></span>[4](#fn_496.md).

31\. 'He makes the sea boil up and down; he makes the sea stream this
and that way; he makes the sea flow this and that way: all the shores of
the sea Vouru-Kasha are boiling over, all the middle of it is boiling
over.

32\. 'And the bright and glorious Ti*s*trya rises up from the sea
Vouru-Kasha, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! the bright and glorious Satavaêsa
rises up from the sea Vouru-Kasha; and vapours rise up above Mount
Us-hindu, that stands in the middle of the sea Vouru-Kasha <span
id="fr_518"></span>[5](#fn_497.md).

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

33\. 'Then the vapours push forward, in the regular shape of
clouds <span id="fr_519"></span>[1](#fn_498.md); they go following the
wind, along the ways which Haoma traverses, the increaser of the
world <span id="fr_520"></span>[2](#fn_499.md). Behind him travels the
mighty wind, made by Mazda, and the rain, and the cloud, and the sleet,
down to the several places, down to the fields, down to the seven
Karshvares of the earth.

34\. 'Apãm Napâ*t* <span id="fr_521"></span>[3](#fn_500.md), O Spitama
Zarathu*s*tra! divides the waters amongst the countries in the material
world, in company with the mighty wind, the Glory, made by the
waters <span id="fr_522"></span>[4](#fn_501.md), and the Fravashis of the
faithful <span id="fr_523"></span>[5](#fn_502.md).

'For his brightness and glory, I will offer him a sacrifice worth being
heard . . . .

35\. 'We sacrifice unto Ti*s*trya, the bright and glorious star, who
from the shining east, moves along his long winding course, along the
path made by the gods, along the way appointed for him the

watery way, at the will of Ahura Mazda, at the will of the
Amesha-Spe*n*tas.

36\. 'We sacrifice unto Ti*s*trya, the bright and glorious star, whose
rising is watched by men who live on the fruits of the year, by the
chiefs of deep <span id="fr_524"></span>[1](#fn_503.md) understanding <span
id="fr_525"></span>[2](#fn_504.md); by the wild beasts in the mountains, by
the tame beasts that run in the plains; they watch him, as he comes up
to the country for a bad year, or for a good year <span

the Aryan countries be fertile?"

the bright and glorious star, swift-flying and swift-moving, who flies
towards the sea Vouru-Kasha, as swiftly as the arrow darted through the
heavenly space, which Erekhsha, the swift archer, the Arya amongst the
Aryas whose arrow was the swiftest, shot from Mount Khshaotha to Mount
*Hv*anva*nt*.

afflicts the Pairikas, who destroys the Pairikas, that Angra Mainyus
flung to stop all the stars that have in them the seed of the
waters <span id="fr_531"></span>[4](#fn_510.md).

40\. 'Ti*s*trya afflicts them, he blows them away from the sea
Vouru-Kasha; then the wind blows the clouds forward, bearing the waters
of fertility, so that the friendly showers spread wide over, they spread
helpingly and friendly over the seven Karshvares.

will the springs with a flow and overflow of waters, thick as a horse's
shoulder, run to the beautiful places and fields, and to the

powerful growth?"

44\. 'I will sacrifice unto Ti*s*trya, the bright and glorious star,
whom Ahura Mazda has established as a lord and overseer above all
stars <span id="fr_534"></span>[3](#fn_513.md), in the same way as he has
established Zarathu*s*tra above men; whom neither Angra Mainyu, nor the
Yâtus and the Pairikas, nor the men Yâtus <span

Daêvas together prevail for his death.

45\. 'We sacrifice unto Ti*s*trya, the bright and glorious star, to whom
Ahura Mazda has given a thousand senses <span

the stars that have in them the seed of the waters:

46\. 'Who moves in light with the stars that have in them the seed of
the waters: he, from the sea Vouru-Kasha, the powerful sea, the
large-sized, deep, and salt of waters, goes to all the lakes, and to all

Vouru-Kasha, mother-like <span id="fr_538"></span>[3](#fn_517.md),
friendly, and healing: he divides them amongst these countries, being

healthful, wise, happy, and powerful, who is the lord of a thousand
boons, and grants many boons to that man who has pleased him, whether
begging or not begging for them.

50\. 'I, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! have created that star Ti*s*trya as
worthy of sacrifice, as worthy of prayer, as worthy of propitiation, as
worthy of glorification as myself, Ahura Mazda <span

51\. 'In order to withstand, to break asunder, to afflict, to drive back
the malice of that Pairika Du*z*yâirya <span

52\. 'Had I not created that star Ti*s*trya as worthy of sacrifice, as
worthy of prayer, as worthy of propitiation, as worthy of glorification
as myself, Ahura Mazda;

53\. 'In order to withstand, to break asunder, to afflict, to drive back
the malice of that Pairika Du*z*yâirya, whom evil-speaking people call
Huyâirya;

54\. 'Then all day long, all night long, that Pairika Du*z*yâirya would
wage war against this material world of mine, wanting to extinguish its
life <span id="fr_545"></span>[1](#fn_524.md), and she goes on, rushing
upon and around it.

55\. 'But the bright and glorious Ti*s*trya keeps that Pairika in bonds,
with twofold bonds, with threefold bonds, that cannot be overcome, with
bonds all over the body: it is as if there were a thousand men keeping
one man in bonds, a thousand men of those who are the strongest in
strength.

56\. 'If the Aryan countries, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! would perform in
honour of the bright and glorious Ti*s*trya the due sacrifice and
invocation, just as that sacrifice and invocation ought to be performed
in the perfection of holiness; never should a hostile horde enter these
Aryan countries, nor any plague, nor leprosy, nor venomous plants <span
id="fr_546"></span>[2](#fn_525.md), nor the chariot of a foe, nor the
uplifted spear of a foe.'

57 <span id="fr_547"></span>[3](#fn_526.md). Zarathu*s*tra asked: 'What is
then, O Ahura Mazda! the sacrifice and invocation in honour of the
bright and glorious Ti*s*trya, as it ought to be performed in the
perfection of holiness?'

58\. Ahura Mazda answered: 'Let the Aryan nations bring libations unto
him; let the Aryan nations tie bundles of baresma for him; let the Aryan
nations cook for him a head of cattle, either white, or black, or of any

<span id="fn_468"></span>[95:1](sbe2313.htm#fr_489.md) Mainivas*au* =
mainyu-as*au* (meaning pun mînôî *g*îvâkîh, svargasthânam, Yasna LVII,
27 \[LVI, 11, 3\]).

<span id="fn_469"></span>[95:2](sbe2313.htm#fr_490.md) Erekhsha
khshviwi-ishu*s*, in Pahlavi Ari*s* Shîvâtîr (see Études Iraniennes, II,
220), or 'Ari*s* of the swift arrow,' was the best archer in the Iranian
army. When Mino*k*ihr and Afrâsyab determined to make peace and to fix
the boundary between Irân and Tûrân, 'it was stipulated that Ari*s*
should ascend Mount Damâvand, and from thence discharge an arrow towards
the east; and that the place in which the arrow fell should form the
boundary between the two kingdoms. Ari*s* thereupon ascended the
mountain, and discharged towards the east an arrow, the flight of which
continued from the dawn of day until noon, when it fell on the banks of
the *G*ihûn (the Oxus),' (Mirkhond, History of the Early Kings of
Persia, trans. by David Shea, p. 175; cf. Noeldeke, Zeitschrift der
Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 1881, p. 445.)

<span id="fn_470"></span>[95:3](sbe2313.htm#fr_491.md) Mount Khshaotha
seems to be the same as Mount Damâvand (see preceding note); Mount
*Hv*anva*nt* may be the same as Mount Bâmîân, from which the Balkh river
springs, as according to Tabari (trans. by Noeldeke, l. l.), Ari*s*’
arrow stopped at the Balkh river (an affluent of the Oxus). But it may
be that the limits given refer to the course of Ti*s*trya; cf. § 38,
text and note.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[95:4](sbe2313.htm#fr_492.md) Doubtful. Shooting
stars are alluded to. Mr. Geiger remarks that there is a swarm of
shooting stars falling every year just at the time when Ti*s*trya, in
the European climate, is supposed to be most active, on the 10th of
August.

<span id="fn_472"></span>[96:1](sbe2313.htm#fr_493.md) See above, [p.
66](sbe2310.htm#page_66), note [3](sbe2310.htm#fn_323.md).

<span id="fn_473"></span>[96:2](sbe2313.htm#fr_494.md) Satavaêsa is said to
be the leader of the western stars (to be read southern stars, Bund. II,
7), and has in its protection the seas of the southern quarter (ibid.
XIII, 12); the Satavaêsa sea is the Persian gulf.

<span id="fn_474"></span>[96:3](sbe2313.htm#fr_495.md) This seems to be an
allusion to the tide in the Arabian sea (the sea Vouru-Kasha) and in the
gulf of Oman, which, being a southern sea, is under the control of
Satavaêsa (cf. preceding note and Vend. V, 18, note 1).

<span id="fn_475"></span>[96:4](sbe2313.htm#fr_496.md) At the right time of

<span id="fn_478"></span>[97:3](sbe2313.htm#fr_499.md) Ti*s*trya; cf. [p.
105](#page_105), note [3](#fn_513.md).

<span id="fn_479"></span>[97:4](sbe2313.htm#fr_500.md) Haptôiri*n*ga (Ursa
Major) is the leader of the stars in the north (Bund. II, 7). It is
'entrusted with the gate and passage of hell, to keep back those of the
nine, and ninety, and nine hundred, and nine thousand and nine myriad
demons, and demonesses, and fairies (Pairikas) and sorcerers (Yâtus) who
are in opposition to the celestial sphere and constellations'
(Minokhired XLIX, 15; tr. by Vest).

<span id="fn_480"></span>[97:5](sbe2313.htm#fr_501.md) Vana*nt* is the
leader of the stars in the south (read west; Bund. II, 7). Cf. Yt. XX.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[97:6](sbe2313.htm#fr_502.md) To obtain . . . .
This invocation is brought about by the very name of Vana*nt*, which
means 'who smites, who overcomes.' The peculiar office of Vana*nt* is to
keep the passes and gates of Mount Albôrz, around which the sun, the
moon, and the stars revolve, and to prevent the Paris and Daêvas from
cutting off and breaking the road of the sun (Minokhired XLIX, 12).

the translation is doubtful; possibly 'as a first-rate man is.'

converted into three forms, the form of a man and the form of a horse
and the form of a bull. . . . as the astrologers say that every
constellation has three forms' (Bund. VII, 4; tr. West). Ti*s*trya
promises his worshippers children (§ 15), oxen (§ 17), or horses (§ 19),
according as he appears in the form of a man (§ 13), of a bull (§ 16),
or of a horse (§ 18).

<span id="fn_493"></span>[101:1](sbe2313.htm#fr_514.md) Adhavô; possibly
'the streams;' cf. Yt. V, 1, note 2. A month in the ancient Persian
calendar, supposed to correspond to September-October, was called
âdukani, which might, on that hypothesis, mean '(the month) that makes
streams spring up.'

<span id="fn_494"></span>[101:2](sbe2313.htm#fr_515.md) Of which the
representative is wheat (Bundahi*s* XXIV, 19.).

<span id="fn_495"></span>[101:3](sbe2313.htm#fr_516.md) Of which the
representative is the summer vetch (ibid. 21).

<span id="fn_497"></span>[101:5](sbe2313.htm#fr_518.md) 'The Aûsindôm
mountain is that which, being of ruby, of the substance of the sky, is
in the midst of the wide-formed ocean (the sea Vouru-Kasha),' (Bund.
XII, 6; tr. West). Mount Aûsindôm receives its waters through a golden
channel from the height Hukairya (cf. Yt. V, 3); from there one portion
flows forth to the ocean for the purification of the sea, and one
portion drizzles in moisture upon the whole of this earth, and all the
creations of <span id="page_102">p. 102</span> Aûharmazd acquire health
from it, and it dispels the dryness of the atmosphere' (ibid. XIII, 5).

<span id="fn_498"></span>[102:1](sbe2313.htm#fr_519.md) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_499"></span>[102:2](sbe2313.htm#fr_520.md) Haoma opens the way
for the waters from heaven, as being the foremost element in sacrifice
(cf. § 24). For the same reason the Bundahi*s* numbers Vohu-Manô, 'Good
Mind,' amongst the cooperators of Ti*s*trya.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[102:5](sbe2313.htm#fr_523.md) The Fravashis are
active in the world struggle; cf. Yt. XIII, 43. 'Co-operators with
Tî*s*tar were Vohûman and the angel Hôm, with the assistance of the
angel Bûr*g* (the same as Apãm Napâ*t*; see [p. 94](#page_94.md), note

(Bundahi*s* VII, 3, tr. West).

<span id="fn_509"></span>[104:3](sbe2313.htm#fr_530.md) Doubtful. Mount
*Hv*anva*nt*, being situated in the sea Vouru-Kasha (as appears from
Ti*s*trya travelling towards that sea, § 38), seems to be the same with
Mount Aûsindôm (§ 32).
