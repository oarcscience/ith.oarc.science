### IV. KHORDÂD YA*S*T.

Only the first two sections of this Ya*s*t refer to its nominal object,
Haurvatâ*t*, the Genius of Health and Waters (Vend. Introd. IV, 7, 33).
The rest of the Ya*s*t refers to the performance of the Bareshnûm
ceremony as being the test of the true Zoroastrian. As the Bareshnûm
purification was performed by Airyaman to drive away the myriads of
diseases created by Angra Mainyu <span id="fr_262"></span>[4](#fn_249.md),
its laudation is not quite unaptly inserted in a Ya*s*t devoted to the
Genius of Health.

The Khordâd Ya*s*t can be recited at any time. It is better to recite it
during the Gâh U*s*ahin, on the day Khordâd (Anquetil).

The text is corrupt.

0\. May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced! . . . .

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathu*s*tra, one
who hates the Daêvas and obeys the laws of Ahura;

For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto \[Hâvani\],
the holy and master of holiness <span id="fr_263"></span>[5](#fn_250.md) .
. . . .

Unto Haurvatâ*t*, the master; unto the prosperity

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

of the seasons and unto the years, the masters of holiness <span
id="fr_264"></span>[1](#fn_251.md),

Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and
glorification.

Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . .

We sacrifice unto Haurvatâ*t*, the Amesha-Spe*n*ta; we sacrifice unto
the prosperity of the seasons; we sacrifice unto the years, the holy and
masters of holiness <span id="fr_265"></span>[2](#fn_252.md).

1\. Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathu*s*tra, saying: 'I created for
the faithful the help, the enjoyments, the comforts, and the pleasures
of Haurvatâ*t*. We unite them with him who would come up to thee as one
of the Amesha-Spe*n*tas, as he would come to any of the
Amesha-Spe*n*tas, Vohu-Manô, Asha-Vahi*s*ta, Khshathra-Vairya,
Spe*n*ta-Ârmaiti, Haurvatâ*t*, and Ameretâ*t*.

2\. 'He who against the thousands of thousands of those Daêvas, against
their ten thousands of ten thousands, against their numberless myriads
would invoke the name of Haurvatâ*t*, as one of the Amesha-Spe*n*tas, he
would smite the Nasu, he would smite Ha*s*i <span
id="fr_266"></span>[3](#fn_253.md), he would smite Ba*s*i <span
id="fr_267"></span>[3](#fn_253.md), he would smite Saêni <span
id="fr_268"></span>[3](#fn_253.md), he would smite Bû*g*i <span
id="fr_269"></span>[3](#fn_253.md).

3 <span id="fr_270"></span>[4](#fn_254.md). 'I proclaim the faithful man as
the first \[of men\]; if I proclaim the faithful man as the first

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[of men\] <span
id="fr_271"></span>[1](#fn_255.md), then Rashnu Razi*s*ta <span
id="fr_272"></span>[2](#fn_256.md), then every heavenly Yazata of male
nature in company with the Amesha-Spe*n*tas will free the faithful
man <span id="fr_273"></span>[3](#fn_257.md)

4\. 'From the Nasu, from Ha*s*i, from Ga*s*i <span
id="fr_274"></span>[4](#fn_258.md), from Saêni, from Bû*g*i; from the
hordes with the wide front, from the hordes with the many spears
uplifted, from the evil man who oppresses, from the wilful sinner <span
id="fr_275"></span>[5](#fn_259.md), from the oppressor of men, from the
Yâtu, from the Pairika, from the straying way.

5\. 'How does the way of the faithful turn and part from the way of the
wicked <span id="fr_276"></span>[6](#fn_260.md)?'

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is when a man pronouncing my spell, either
reading <span id="fr_277"></span>[7](#fn_261.md) or reciting it by heart,
draws the furrows <span id="fr_278"></span>[8](#fn_262.md) and hides <span
id="fr_279"></span>[9](#fn_263.md) there himself, \[saying\]:

6\. "I will smite thee, O Dru*g*! whomsoever thou art, whomsoever thou
art amongst the Dru*g*es that come in an open way, whomsoever thou art
amongst the Dru*g*es that come by hidden ways, whomsoever thou art
amongst the Dru*g*es that defile by contact; whatsoever Dru*g* thou art,
I smite thee away from the Aryan countries; whatsoever Dru*g* thou art,
I bind thee; I smite thee down, O Dru*g*! I throw thee down below, O
Dru*g*!"

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

7\. 'He draws \[then\] three furrows <span
id="fr_280"></span>[1](#fn_264.md): I proclaim him one of the faithful; he
draws six furrows <span id="fr_281"></span>[1](#fn_264.md): I proclaim him
one of the faithful; he draws nine furrows <span
id="fr_282"></span>[1](#fn_264.md): I proclaim him one of the faithful.

8\. 'The names of those (Amesha-Spe*n*tas) smite the men turned to
Nasus <span id="fr_283"></span>[2](#fn_265.md) by the Dru*g*es; the seed
and kin of the deaf <span id="fr_284"></span>[3](#fn_266.md) are smitten,
the scornful <span id="fr_285"></span>[4](#fn_267.md) are dead, as the
Zaotar Zarathu*s*tra blows them away to woe <span
id="fr_286"></span>[5](#fn_268.md), however fierce, at his will and wish,
as many as he wishes.

9\. 'From the time when the sun is down he smites them with bruising
blows; from the time when the sun is no longer up, he deals deadly blows
on the Nasu with his club struck down, for the propitiation and
glorification of the heavenly gods.

10\. 'O Zarathu*s*tra! let not that spell be shown to any one, except by
the father to his son, or by the brother to his brother from the same
womb, or by the Âthravan to his pupil <span
id="fr_287"></span>[6](#fn_269.md) in black hair, devoted to the good law,
who, devoted to the good law, holy <span id="fr_288"></span>[7](#fn_270.md)
and brave, stills all the Dru*g*es <span
id="fr_289"></span>[8](#fn_271.md).

11\. 'For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice
worth being heard, namely, unto Haurvatâ*t*, the Amesha-Spe*n*ta. Unto
Haurvatâ*t*, the Amesha-Spe*n*ta, we offer up the libations, the Haoma
and meat, the baresma, the wisdom of the tongue, the

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

holy spells, the speech, the deeds, the libations, and the
rightly-spoken words.

12\. 'Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . .
. .

'I bless the sacrifice and prayer, and the strength and vigour of
Haurvatâ*t*, the master; of the prosperity of the seasons and of the
years, the masters of holiness.

'Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good. . . . .

'\[Give\] unto that man <span id="fr_290"></span>[1](#fn_272.md)'
brightness and glory, . . . . give him the bright, all happy, blissful
abode of the holy Ones.'
