<p><FONT SIZE="-1">D&icirc;n (Da&ecirc;na) presides over the 24th day of the month (S&icirc;r&ocirc;zah 24) and gives it her name; she is invoked in company with <I>K</I>ista, and in fact this Ya<I>s</I>t, though it bears the name of Da&ecirc;na, is consecrated to Kista (&sect;&sect; 2, 7). These two Genii are, however, very closely connected in their nature, as Da&ecirc;na is the impersonation of the Zoroastrian Law or Religion, and Kista is religious knowledge, the knowledge of what leads to bliss (far<I>g</I>&acirc;nak, nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;na; the same as <I>K</I>isti).</p>  
<p>The description of <I>K</I>ista is rather pallid, and does not rise above abstractions (see, however, Mihir Ya<I>s</I>t, &sect; 126). She was not worshipped by the old epic heroes as An&acirc;hita was, but by Zarathu<I>s</I>tra and his wife, because she must have been, from her very name and nature, a goddess of Zoroastrian origin and growth.</FONT></p>
