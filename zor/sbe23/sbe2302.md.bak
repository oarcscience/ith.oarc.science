### INTRODUCTION.

THE present volume contains a translation of the Sîrôzahs and Ya*s*ts,
and of the Nyâyi*s*. This part of the Avesta treats chiefly of the
mythical and legendary lore of Zoroastrianism.

For a satisfactory translation of these texts, the etymological and
comparative method is generally considered as the best or as the only
possible one, on account of the entire absence of any traditional
interpretation. I have tried, however, to reduce the sphere of
etymological guesswork to its narrowest limits, with the help of
different Pahlavi, Persian, and Sanskrit translations, which are as yet
unpublished, and have been neglected by former translators. I found such
translations for the Sîrôzahs, for Ya*s*ts I, VI, VII, XI, XXIII, XXIV,
and for the Nyâyi*s* <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) (besides the
already published translations of Ya*s*ts XXI and XXII).

Of the remaining Ya*s*ts, which are mostly of an epical character, there
is no direct translation available; but a close comparison of the
legends in Firdausi's Shah Nâmah seems to throw some light, even as
regards philological points, on not a few obscure and important
passages. This has enabled me, I believe, to restore a few myths to
their original form, and to frame a more correct idea of others <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md).

In this volume, as in the preceding one, I have to thank Mr. West for
his kind assistance in making my translation more readable, as well as
for valuable hints in the interpretation of several passages.
