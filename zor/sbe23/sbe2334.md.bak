### V. ÂTA*S* NYÂYI*S*

1 <span id="fr_1609"></span>[6](#fn_1538.md). Take me out <span
id="fr_1610"></span>[7](#fn_1539.md), O Ahura! give me perfect piety and
strength . . . .

4 <span id="fr_1611"></span>[8](#fn_1540.md). May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced!
. . . .

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

Hail unto thee, O Fire, son of Ahura Mazda, thou beneficent and most
great Yazata!

 <span id="fr_1612"></span>[1](#fn_1541.md)Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best
of all good . . . .

I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda . . . .

For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification . . . .

Unto Âtar, the son of Ahura Mazda; unto thee Âtar, son of Ahura Mazda!

5 <span id="fr_1613"></span>[2](#fn_1542.md). Unto Âtar, the son of Ahura
Mazda; unto the Glory and the Weal, made by Mazda; unto the Glory of the
Aryas, made by Mazda; unto the Glory of the Kavis, made by Mazda.

Unto Âtar, the son of Ahura Mazda; unto king Husravah; unto the lake of
Husravah; unto Mount Âsnava*nt*, made by Mazda; unto Lake *K*aê*k*asta,
made by Mazda; unto the Glory of the Kavis, made by Mazda.

6\. Unto Âtar, the son of Ahura Mazda; unto Mount Raêva*nt*, made by
Mazda; unto the Glory of the Kavis, made by Mazda.

Unto Âtar, the son of Ahura Mazda.

Unto Âtar, the beneficent, the warrior; the God who is a full source of
Glory, the God who is a full source of healing.

Unto Âtar, the son of Ahura Mazda, with all Âtars; unto the God
Nairyô-sangha, who dwells in the navel of kings;

Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and
glorification.

Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . .

7 <span id="fr_1614"></span>[3](#fn_1543.md). I bless the sacrifice and
invocation, and the

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

good offering, the beneficent offering, the offering of assistance
offered unto thee, O Âtar, son of Ahura Mazda!

Thou art worthy of sacrifice and invocation; mayest thou receive the
sacrifice and the invocation in the houses of men.

Well may it be unto the man who ever worships thee with a sacrifice,
holding the sacred wood in his hand, the baresma in his hand, the meat
in his hand, the mortar <span id="fr_1615"></span>[1](#fn_1544.md) in his
hand.

8\. Mayest thou have the right <span id="fr_1616"></span>[2](#fn_1545.md)
wood! Mayest thou have the right incense! Mayest thou have the right
food! Mayest thou have the right fuel <span
id="fr_1617"></span>[3](#fn_1546.md)!

Mayest thou be full-grown for protecting (this house)! Mayest thou grow
excellent for protecting!

9\. Mayest thou burn in this house! Mayest thou ever burn in this house!
Mayest thou blaze in this house! Mayest thou increase in this house!
Even for a long time, till the powerful restoration of the world, till
the time of the good, powerful restoration of the world!

10\. Give me, O Âtar, son of Ahura Mazda! lively welfare, lively
maintenance, lively living; fulness of welfare, fulness of maintenance,
fulness of life;

Knowledge, sagacity; quickness of tongue; (holiness of) soul; a good
memory; and then the understanding that goes on growing and the one that
is not acquired through learning <span
id="fr_1618"></span>[4](#fn_1547.md);

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

And then the manly courage,

11\. Firm-footed, unsleeping, (sleeping only) for a third part of the
day and of the night, quick to rise up from bed, ever awake;

And a protecting, virtuous offspring, able to rule countries and
assemblies of men, well growing up, good, freeing us from the pangs (of
hell), endowed with a good intellect, that may increase my house, my
borough, my town, my country, my empire.

12\. Give me, O Âtar, son of Ahura Mazda! however unworthy I am <span
id="fr_1619"></span>[1](#fn_1548.md), now and for ever, a seat in the
bright, all-happy, blissful abode of the holy Ones.

May I obtain the good reward, a good renown <span
id="fr_1620"></span>[2](#fn_1549.md), and long cheerfulness for my
soul <span id="fr_1621"></span>[3](#fn_1550.md)!

13\. Âtar, the son of Ahura Mazda, lifts up his voice to all those for
whom he cooks their evening meal and their morning meal <span
id="fr_1622"></span>[4](#fn_1551.md). From all those he wishes a good
offering, a beneficent offering, an offering of assistance, O Spitama!

14\. Âtar looks at the hands of all those who pass by: 'What does the
friend bring to his friend? What does he who comes and goes bring to
him <span id="fr_1623"></span>[5](#fn_1552.md) who stays motionless?'

We sacrifice unto Âtar, the valiant warrior <span
id="fr_1624"></span>[6](#fn_1553.md).

15\. And if the passer-by brings him wood holily brought, or bundles of
baresma holily tied up, or

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

twigs of Hadhânaêpata <span id="fr_1625"></span>[1](#fn_1554.md) then Âtar,
the son of Ahura Mazda, well pleased with him and not angry, and fed as
required, will thus bless him:

16\. 'May herds of oxen grow for thee, and increase of sons; may thy
mind be master of its vow, may thy soul be master of its vow, and mayest
thou live on in the joy of the soul all the nights of thy life.'

This is the blessing which Âtar speaks unto him who brings him dry wood,
well-examined by the light of the day, well-cleansed with godly
intent <span id="fr_1626"></span>[2](#fn_1555.md).

17\. Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . .
.

I bless the sacrifice and prayer, and the strength and vigour of Âtar,
the son of Ahura Mazda <span id="fr_1627"></span>[3](#fn_1556.md) . . . .

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . .

18 <span id="fr_1628"></span>[3](#fn_1556.md). We gladden by our virtue thy
mighty Fire, O Ahura! thy most quick and powerful Fire, who shows his
assistance <span id="fr_1629"></span>[4](#fn_1557.md) to him who has ever
comforted him, but delights in taking vengeance with his hands on the
man who has harmed him.
