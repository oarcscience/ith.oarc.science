### XV. RÂM YA*S*T.

This Ya*s*t bears the name of Râma *Hv*âstra, the Genius who presides
over the 21st day of the month (Sîrôzah, § 21), and is devoted to his
Hamkâr, Vayu.

Regarding Râma [*Hv*âstra](errata.htm#3.md), the Genius that gives good
abodes and good pastures, and his connection with Vayu, see Vend.
Introd. IV, and Études Iraniennes, II, 187.

This Ya*s*t can be divided into two parts. The first part (§§ 1-140)
contains an enumeration of worshippers who sacrificed to Vayu: Ahura
Mazda (§ 2), Haoshyangha (§ 7), Takhma Urupa (§ 11), Yima (§ 15), A*z*i
Dahâka (§ 19), Thraêtaona (§ 23), Keresâspa (§ 27), Aurvasâra (§ 31),
Hutaosa (§ 35), and Iranian maids (§ 39). The second part (§§ 42-58)
contains a special enumeration and glorification of the many names of
Vayu (§§ 42-50).

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathu*s*tra, one
who hates the Daêvas, and obeys the laws of Ahura;

For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto \[Hâvani\],
the holy and master of holiness . . . .

Unto Râma *Hv*âstra, unto Vayu who works highly and is more powerful to
afflict than all other creatures <span

To this Vayu do we sacrifice, this Vayu do we invoke, for this house,
for the master of this house, and for the man here who is offering

our enemies at one stroke.

the Good Spirit!'

Mazda, did pursue it.

highly.

To this part of thee do we sacrifice, O Vayu! that belongs to Spe*n*ta
Mainyu <span id="fr_1164"></span>[5](#fn_1102.md).

For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice worth
being heard, namely, unto the awful Vayu, who works highly. We offer up
a sacrifice unto the awful Vayu, who works highly, with the libations,
with the Haoma and meat, with the baresma, with the wisdom of the
tongue, with the

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

holy spells, the words, the deeds, the libations, and the well-spoken
words.

never-failing <span id="fr_1172"></span>[1](#fn_1110.md).'

<span id="fn_1112"></span>[253:3](sbe2320.htm#fr_1174.md) Or, 'his accursed
palace of the Stork' (upa kviri*n*tem duzitem). 'A*z*i Dahâka,' says
Hamza (p. 32 in the text, p. 22 in the translation), 'used to live in
Babylon (cf. Yt. V, 29), where he had built a palace in the form of a
stork; he called it Kuleng Dîs (<span id="img_25300"></span>
![](img/25300.jpg)), the fortress of the Stork; the inhabitants called
it Dis Het (<span id="img_25301"></span> ![](img/25301.jpg)).' Kuleng
Dîs was in Zend Kviri*n*ta daêza and Dis Het is nothing else than
Du*z*ita. One may doubt <span id="page_254">p. 254</span> whether
Kviri*n*ta is the name of a place or the Zend form of Kuleng, a stork:
in any case it was a palace in Bawri (Babylon). In the Shah Nâmah it is
called Di*z*ukht (du*z*-ukhta for du*z*-ita; see Études Iraniennes, II,
211).

sons, Keresâspa, a warrior, and Urvâkhshaya, a judge and law-giver
(Yasna IX, 10 \[29 seq.\]). We have no further details about
Urvâkhshaya's legend than that he was killed by 'Hitâspa, the
golden-crowned' (cf. Yt. XIX, 4I), and avenged by Keresâspa.

<span id="fn_1118"></span>[256:1](sbe2320.htm#fr_1180.md) A disconnected
allusion to the struggle of Keresâspa with the Ga*n*darewa (Yt. V, 38,
text and notes; XIX, 41). On the words 'the son of Ahura . . . .' cf.
Ormazd et Ahriman, p. 215, note 1.

razûra is called 'the chief of forests' (Bund. XXIV, 16). According to

<span id="fn_1123"></span>[257:1](sbe2320.htm#fr_1185.md) This line looks
as if it should belong to a counter-prayer by Husravah, which was heard
by Vayu, as appears from Yt. V, 50.

<span id="fn_1126"></span>[258:1](sbe2320.htm#fr_1188.md) It may be doubted
whether the allusion here is to a legend of marriage en masse, following
the marriage of Hutaosa with Vî*s*tâspa, or whether the aorist is used
with an indicative meaning: 'To him do the maids who have known no man .
. . . They beg of him a boon, saying . . . .' Cf. Yt. XVI, 17.
