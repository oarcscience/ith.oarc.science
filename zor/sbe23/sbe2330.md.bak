# NYÂYI*S*.

A Nyâyi*s* is properly a begging prayer, as opposed to Sitâyi*s*, a
prayer of praise. It is a term particularly applied to five prayers
addressed to the Sun, to Mithra, to the Moon, to Waters, and to Fire.
Every layman over eight years old is bound to recite the Nyâyi*s*: he
recites it standing and girded with his Kôstî.

The Sun Nyâyi*s* is recited three times a day, at the rising of the sun
(Gâh Hâvan), at noon (Gâh Rapitvin), and at three o'clock in the
afternoon (Gâh Uzîren). The Mithra Nyâyi*s* is recited with the Sun
Nyâyi*s*, as Mithra follows the sun in its course (see Yt. X, 13).

The Moon Nyâyi*s* is recited three times a month: first, at the time
when it begins to be seen; second, when it is at the full; third, when
it is on the wane.

The Waters Nyâyi*s* and the Fire Nyâyi*s* are recited every day, when
one finds oneself in the proximity of those elements. The Fire Nyâyi*s*
is recited with the Penôm on (see Vend. p. 168, 7).

The first four Nyâyi*s* must be recited especially on the days over
which the Izads invoked preside; that is to say, on the Khôrshê*d*,
Mihir, Mâh, and Âbân days (the eleventh, sixteenth, twelfth, and tenth
days of the month) <span id="fr_1567"></span>[1](#fn_1499.md).

Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification
. . . . <span id="fr_1587"></span>[1](#fn_1516.md)

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .
