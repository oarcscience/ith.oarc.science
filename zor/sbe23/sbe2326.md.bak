### XXI AND XXII. YA*S*T FRAGMENTS.

These two Ya*s*ts or Ya*s*t fragments are known among the Parsis as the
Hâdhôkht Nask, though their context does not correspond to any part of
the description of that Nask as given in the Dîn-kart (West, Pahlavi
Texts, I, 224, note 8). A Pahlavi translation of these Ya*s*ts has been
edited by Haug and West (The Book of Ardâ Vîrâf, p. 269 seq.).

### XXI. YA*S*T FRAGMENT.

Ya*s*t XXI is a eulogy of the Ashem Vohû prayer, the value of which
rises higher and higher, according as the circumstances under which it
is being recited are of greater importance.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1\. Zarathu*s*tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent
Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One!

What is the only word in which is contained the glorification of all
good things, of all the things that are the offspring of the good
principle?'

2\. Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is the praise of Holiness <span
id="fr_1391"></span>[1](#fn_1325.md), O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra!

3\. 'He who recites the praise of Holiness <span
id="fr_1392"></span>[1](#fn_1325.md), in the fulness of faith and with a
devoted heart, praises me, Ahura Mazda; he praises the waters, he
praises the earth, he praises the cattle, he praises the plants, he
praises all good things made by Mazda, all the things that are the
offspring of the good principle.

4\. 'For the reciting of that word of truth, O Zarathu*s*tra! the
pronouncing of that formula, the Ahuna Vairya, increases strength and
victory in one's soul and piety.

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

5\. 'For that only recital of the praise of Holiness is worth a hundred
khshnaothras of the beings of Holiness <span
id="fr_1393"></span>[1](#fn_1326.md), when delivered while going to sleep,
a thousand when delivered after eating, ten thousand when delivered
during cohabitation, or any number when delivered in departing this
life.'

 

6\. 'What is the one recital of the praise of Holiness that is worth ten
others in greatness, goodness, and fairness?

7\. Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is that one, O holy Zarathu*s*tra! that a
man delivers when eating the gifts of Haurvatâ*t* and Ameretâ*t* <span
id="fr_1394"></span>[2](#fn_1327.md), at the same time professing good
thoughts, good words, and good deeds, and rejecting evil thoughts, evil
words, and evil deeds.'

 

8\. 'What is the one recital of the praise of Holiness that is worth a
hundred others in greatness, goodness, and fairness?'

9\. Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is that one, O holy Zarathu*s*tra! that a
man delivers while drinking of the Haoma strained for the sacrifice, at
the same time professing good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, and
rejecting evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds.'

 

10\. 'What is the one recital of the praise of Holiness that is worth a
thousand others in greatness, goodness, and fairness?'

11\. Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is that one, O holy Zarathu*s*tra! that a
man delivers when starting

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

up from his bed or going to sleep again, at the same time professing
good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, and rejecting evil thoughts,
evil words, and evil deeds.'

 

12\. 'What is the one recital of the praise of Holiness that is worth
ten thousand others in greatness, goodness, and fairness?'

13\. Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is that one, O holy Zarathu*s*tra! that a
man delivers when waking up and rising from sleep, at the same time
professing good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, and rejecting evil
thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds.'

 

14\. 'What is the one recital of the praise of Holiness that is worth
this Karshvare of ours, *Hv*aniratha <span
id="fr_1395"></span>[1](#fn_1328.md), with its cattle and its chariots,
without its men, in greatness, goodness, and fairness?'

15\. Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is that one, O holy Zarathu*s*tra! that a
man delivers in the last moments of his life, at the same time
professing good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, and rejecting evil
thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds.'

 

16\. 'What is the one recital of the praise of Holiness that is worth
all that is between the earth and the heavens, and this earth, and that
luminous space, and all the good things made by Mazda, that are the
offspring of the good principle in greatness, goodness, and fairness?'

17\. Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is that one, O holy Zarathu*s*tra! that a
man delivers to renounce evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds <span
id="fr_1396"></span>[2](#fn_1329.md).'
