### XIII. FARVARDÎN YA*S*T.

The Fravashi is the inner power in every being that maintains it and
makes it grow and subsist. Originally the Fravashis were the same as the
Pit*ri*s of the Hindus or the Manes of the Latins, that is to say, the
everlasting and deified souls of the dead (see §§ 49-52); but in course
of time they gained a wider domain, and not only men, but gods and even
physical objects, like the sky and the earth, &c. (§§ 85-86), had each a
Fravashi (see Ormazd et Ahriman, §§ 111-113).

This Ya*s*t is to be divided into two parts. The former part (§§ 1-84)
is a glorification of the powers and attributes of the Fravashis in
general; the latter part (§§ 85–158) is an enumeration of the Fravashis
of the most celebrated heroes of Mazdeism, from the first man, Gaya
Maretan, down to the last, Saoshya*nt*.

This latter part is like a Homer's catalogue of Mazdeism. The greatest
part of the historical legends of Iran lies here condensed into a
register of proper names. This enumeration is divided into seven
chapters:

The first (XXIV, §§ 85-95) contains the names of several gods, of the
first man, Gaya Maretan, the first law-giver, Zarathu*s*tra, and his
first disciple, Maidhyô-m*a*ungha;

The second part (XXV, §§ 96-110) contains the names of the disciples of
Zarathu*s*tra, most of them belonging to the epical cyclus of Vî*s*tâspa
(Gu*s*tâsp);

The third part (XXVI, §§ 111-117) is of uncertain character, and no name
contained in it is found in the epical legends;

The fourth part (XXVII, §§ 118-128) seems to be devoted to the heroes of
the other Karshvares and to mythical beings, born or unborn (cf. §§ 121,
122, 127, 128);

The fifth part (XXVIII, § 129) is devoted to Saoshya*nt* alone; The
sixth part (XXIX, §§ 130-138) is devoted to the heroes before the time
of Zarathu*s*tra;

The seventh part (XXX, §§ 139-142) is devoted to the holy women of
Mazdeism from Hvôvi, Zarathu*s*tra's wife, down to Srûta*t*-fedhri,
Vanghu-fedhri, and Ereda*t*-fedhri, the future mothers of his three
unborn sons.

The second, third, and fourth enumerations all end with the

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

name of Astva*t*-ereta (that is to say, Saoshya*nt*), which shows that
they do not refer to successive generations, but to three independent
branches, which are each developed apart down to the time of the
Saviour.

0\. May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced! . . . .

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathu*s*tra, one
who hates the Daêvas and obeys the laws of Ahura;

For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto \[Hâvani\],
the holy and master of holiness.

Unto the awful, overpowering Fravashis of the faithful; unto the
Fravashis of the men of the primitive law <span
id="fr_851"></span>[1](#fn_810.md); unto the Fravashis of the next-of-kin,

Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and
glorification.

Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness. . . .

#### I.

1\. Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathu*s*tra, saying: 'Do thou
proclaim, O pure Zarathu*s*tra! the vigour and strength, the glory, the
help and the joy that are in the Fravashis of the faithful, the awful
and overpowering Fravashis; do thou tell how they come to help me, how
they bring assistance unto me, the awful Fravashis of the faithful <span
id="fr_852"></span>[2](#fn_811.md).

2\. 'Through their brightness and glory, O Zarathu*s*tra! I maintain
that sky, there above, shining and seen afar, and encompassing this
earth all around.

3\. 'It looks like a palace, that stands built of a

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

heavenly substance <span id="fr_853"></span>[1](#fn_812.md), firmly
established, with ends that lie afar, shining in its body of ruby over
the three-thirds (of the earth) <span id="fr_854"></span>[2](#fn_813.md);
it is like a garment inlaid with stars, made of a heavenly substance,
that Mazda puts on, along with Mithra and Rashnu and Spe*n*ta-Ârmaiti,
and on no side can the eye perceive the end of it.

4\. 'Through their brightness and glory, O Zarathu*s*tra! I maintain
Ardvi Sara Anâhita, the wide-expanding and health-giving, who hates the
Daêvas and obeys the laws of Ahura, who is worthy of sacrifice in the
material world, worthy of prayer in the material world; the
life-increasing and holy, the flocks-increasing and holy, the
fold-increasing and holy, the wealth-increasing and holy, the
country-increasing and holy <span id="fr_855"></span>[3](#fn_814.md);

5 <span id="fr_856"></span>[4](#fn_815.md). 'Who makes the seed of all
males pure, who makes the womb of all females pure for bringing forth,
who makes all females bring forth in safety, who puts milk in the
breasts of all females in the right measure and the right quality;

6\. 'The large river, known afar, that is as large as the whole of all
the waters that run along the earth; that runs powerfully from the
height Hukairya down to the sea Vouru-Kasha.

7\. 'All the shores of the sea Vouru-Kasha are boiling over, all the
middle of it is boiling over,

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

when she runs down there, when she streams down there, she, Ardvi Sûra
Anâhita, who has a thousand cells and a thousand channels; the extent of
each of those cells, of each of those channels, is as much as a man can
ride in forty days, riding on a good horse.

8\. 'From this river of mine alone flow all the waters that spread all
over the seven Karshvares; this river of mine alone goes on bringing
waters, both in summer and in winter. This river of mine purifies the
seed in males, the womb in females, the milk in females’ breasts <span
id="fr_857"></span>[1](#fn_816.md).

9\. 'Through their brightness and glory, O Zarathu*s*tra! I maintain the
wide earth made by Ahura, the large and broad earth, that bears so much
that is fine, that bears all the bodily world, the live and the dead,
and the high mountains, rich in pastures and waters;

10\. 'Upon which run the many streams and rivers; upon which the many
kinds of plants grow up from the ground, to nourish animals and men, to
nourish the Aryan nations, to nourish the five kinds of animals <span
id="fr_858"></span>[2](#fn_817.md), and to help the faithful.

11\. 'Through their brightness and glory, O Zarathu*s*tra! I maintain in
the womb the child that has been conceived, so that it does not die from
the

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

assaults of Vîdôtu <span id="fr_859"></span>[1](#fn_818.md), and I develop
in it <span id="fr_860"></span>[2](#fn_819.md) the bones, the hair, the . .
. .  <span id="fr_861"></span>[3](#fn_820.md), the entrails, the feet, and
the sexual organs.

12\. 'Had not the awful Fravashis of the faithful given help unto me,
those animals and men of mine, of which there are such excellent kinds,
would not subsist; strength would belong to the Dru*g*, the dominion
would belong to the Dru*g*, the material world would belong to the
Dru*g*.

13\. 'Between the earth and the sky the immaterial creatures would be
harassed by the Dru*g*; between the earth and the sky the immaterial
creatures would be smitten by the Dru*g*; and never afterwards would
Angra-Mainyu give way to the blows of Spe*n*ta-Mainyu.

14\. 'Through their brightness and glory the waters run and flow forward
from the never-failing springs; through their brightness and glory the
plants grow up from the earth, by the never-failing springs; through
their brightness and glory the winds blow, driving down the clouds
towards the never-failing springs.

15\. 'Through their brightness and glory the females conceive offspring;
through their brightness and glory they bring forth in safety; it is
through their brightness and glory when they become blessed with
children.

16\. 'Through their brightness and glory a man is born who is a chief in
assemblies and meetings <span id="fr_862"></span>[4](#fn_821.md), who
listens well <span id="fr_863"></span>[5](#fn_822) to the (holy.md) words,
whom Wisdom

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

holds dear <span id="fr_864"></span>[1](#fn_823.md), and who returns a
victor from discussions with Gaotema, the heretic <span
id="fr_865"></span>[2](#fn_824.md).

'Through their brightness and glory the sun goes his way; through their
brightness and glory the moon goes her way; through their brightness and
glory the stars go their way.

17\. 'In fearful battles they are the wisest for help, the Fravashis of
the faithful.

'The most powerful amongst the Fravashis of the faithful, O Spitama! are
those of the men of the primitive law <span
id="fr_866"></span>[3](#fn_825.md) or those of the Saoshya*nt*s <span
id="fr_867"></span>[4](#fn_826.md) not yet born, who are to restore the
world. Of the Others, the Fravashis of the living faithful are more
powerful, O Zarathu*s*tra! than those of the dead, O Spitama!

18\. 'And the man who in life shall treat the Fravashis of the faithful
well, will become a ruler of the country with full power, and a chief
most strong; so shall any man of you become, who shall treat Mithra
well, the lord of wide pastures, and Ar*s*tâ*t*, who makes the world
grow, who makes the world increase.

19\. 'Thus do I proclaim unto thee, O pure Spitama! the vigour and
strength, the glory, the help, and the joy that are in the Fravashis of
the faithful,

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

the awful and overpowering Fravashis; and how they come to help me, how
they bring assistance unto me, the awful Fravashis of the faithful <span
id="fr_868"></span>[1](#fn_827.md).'

#### II.

20\. Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathu*s*tra, saying: 'If in this
material world, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! thou happenest to come upon
frightful roads, full of dangers and fears, O Zarathu*s*tra! and thou
fearest for thyself, then do thou recite these words, then proclaim
these fiend-smiting words, O Zarathu*s*tra!

21\. ' "I praise, I invoke, I meditate upon, and we sacrifice unto the
good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful. We worship the
Fravashis of the masters of the houses, those of the lords of the
boroughs, those of the lords of the towns, those of the lords of the
countries, those of the Zarathu*s*trôtemas <span
id="fr_869"></span>[2](#fn_828.md); the Fravashis of those that are, the
Fravashis of those that have been, the Fravashis of those that will be;
all the Fravashis of all nations <span id="fr_870"></span>[3](#fn_829.md),
and most friendly the Fravashis of the friendly nations;

22\. ' "Who maintain the sky, who maintain the waters, who maintain the
earth, who maintain the cattle, who maintain in the womb the child that
has been conceived, so that it does not die from the assaults of Vîdôtu,
and develop in it the bones, the hair, the . . . ., the entrails, the
feet, and the sexual organs <span id="fr_871"></span>[4](#fn_830.md);

23\. ' "Who are much-bringing, who move with

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

awfulness, well-moving, swiftly moving, quickly moving, who move when
invoked; who are to be invoked in the conquest of good, who are to be
invoked in fights against foes, who are to be invoked in battles;

24\. ' "Who give victory to their invoker, who give boons to their
lover, who give health to the sick man, who give good Glory to the
faithful man that brings libations and invokes them with a sacrifice and
words of propitiation <span id="fr_872"></span>[1](#fn_831.md);

25\. ' "Who turn to that side where are faithful men, most devoted to
holiness, and where is the greatest piety <span
id="fr_873"></span>[2](#fn_832.md), where the faithful man is
rejoiced <span id="fr_874"></span>[3](#fn_833.md), and where the faithful
man is not ill-treated <span id="fr_875"></span>[4](#fn_834.md)." '

#### III.

26\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
who are the mightiest of drivers, the lightest of those driving
forwards, the slowest of the retiring <span
id="fr_876"></span>[5](#fn_835.md), the safest <span
id="fr_877"></span>[5](#fn_835.md) of all bridges, the least-erring <span
id="fr_878"></span>[5](#fn_835.md) of all weapons and arms <span
id="fr_879"></span>[6](#fn_836.md), and who never turn their backs <span
id="fr_880"></span>[7](#fn_837.md).

27\. At once, wherever they come, we worship them, the good ones, the
excellent ones, the good, the strong, the beneficent Fravashis of the
faithful. They are to be invoked when the bundles of baresma are tied;
they are to be invoked in fights against foes, in battles <span
id="fr_881"></span>[8](#fn_838.md), and there where gallant men strive to
conquer foes.

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

28\. Mazda invoked them for help, when he fixed the sky and the waters
and the earth and the plants; when Spe*n*ta-Mainyu fixed the sky, when
he fixed the waters, when the earth, when the cattle, when the plants,
when the child conceived in the womb, so that it should not die from the
assaults of Vîdôtu, and developed in it the bones, the hair, the . . .
., the entrails, the feet, and the sexual organs <span
id="fr_882"></span>[1](#fn_839.md).

29\. Spe*n*ta-Mainyu maintained the sky, and they sustained it from
below, they, the strong Fravashis, who sit in silence, gazing with sharp
looks; whose eyes and ears are powerful, who bring long joy, high and
high-girded; well-moving and moving afar, loud-snorting <span
id="fr_883"></span>[2](#fn_840.md), possessing riches and a high renown.

#### IV.

30\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful;
whose friendship is good, and who know how to benefit; whose friendship
lasts long; who like to stay in the abode where they are not harmed by
its dwellers; who are good, beautiful afar <span
id="fr_884"></span>[3](#fn_841.md), health-giving, of high renown,
conquering in battle, and who never do harm first.

#### V.

31\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful;
whose will is dreadful unto those who vex them; powerfully working and
most beneficent; who in battle break the dread arms of their foes and
haters.

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

#### VI.

32\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful;
liberal, valiant, and full of strength, not to be seized by thought,
welfare-giving, kind, and health-giving, following with Ashi's remedies,
as far as the earth extends, as the rivers stretch, as the sun
rises <span id="fr_885"></span>[1](#fn_842.md).

#### VII.

33\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
who gallantly and bravely fight, causing havoc, wounding <span
id="fr_886"></span>[2](#fn_843.md), breaking to pieces all the malice of
the malicious, Daêvas and men, and smiting powerfully in battle, at
their wish and will.

34\. You kindly deliver the Victory made by Ahura, and the crushing
Ascendant, most beneficently, to those countries where you, the good
ones, unharmed and rejoiced, unoppressed and unoffended, have been held
worthy of sacrifice and prayer, and proceed the way of your wish.

#### VIII.

35\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
of high renown, smiting in battle, most strong, shield-bearing and
harmless to those who are true, whom both the pursuing and the fleeing
invoke for help: the pursuer invokes

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

them for a swift race, and for a swift race does the fleer invoke them;

36\. Who turn to that side where are faithful men, most devoted to
holiness, and where is the greatest piety, where the faithful man is
rejoiced, and where the faithful man is not ill-treated <span
id="fr_887"></span>[1](#fn_844.md).

#### IX.

37\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
who form many battalions, girded with weapons <span
id="fr_888"></span>[2](#fn_845.md), lifting up spears, and full of sheen;
who in fearful battles come rushing along where the gallant heroes <span
id="fr_889"></span>[3](#fn_846.md) go and assail the Dânus <span
id="fr_890"></span>[4](#fn_847.md).

38\. There you destroy the victorious strength of the Turanian Dânus;
there you destroy the malice of the Turanian Dânus; through you the
chiefs <span id="fr_891"></span>[5](#fn_848.md) are of high intellect <span
id="fr_892"></span>[6](#fn_849.md) and most successful; they, the gallant
heroes the gallant Saoshya*nt*s <span id="fr_893"></span>[7](#fn_850.md),
the gallant conquerors of the offspring of the Dânus chiefs of myriads,
who wound with stones <span id="fr_894"></span>[8](#fn_851.md).

#### X.

39\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
who rout the two wings of an army standing in battle array, who make the
centre swerve, and swiftly pursue onwards, to help the faithful and to
distress the doers of evil deeds.

#### XI.

40\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Fravashis of the
faithful; awful, overpowering, and victorious, smiting in battle, sorely
wounding, blowing away (the foes), moving along to and fro, of good
renown, fair of body, godly of soul, and holy; who give victory to their
invoker, who give boons to their lover, who give health to the sick
man <span id="fr_895"></span>[1](#fn_852.md);

41\. Who give good glory to him who worships them with a sacrifice, as
that man did worship them, the holy Zarathu*s*tra, the chief of the
material world, the head of the two-footed race, in whatever struggle he
had to enter, in whatever distress he did fear;

42\. Who, when well invoked, enjoy bliss in the heavens; who, when well
invoked, come forward from the heavens, who are the heads <span
id="fr_896"></span>[2](#fn_853.md) of that sky above, possessing the
well-shapen Strength, the Victory made by Ahura, the crushing Ascendant,
and Welfare <span id="fr_897"></span>[3](#fn_854.md), the wealth-bringing,
boon-bringing, holy, well fed, worthy of sacrifice and prayer in the
perfection of holiness.

43\. They shed Satavaêsa <span id="fr_898"></span>[4](#fn_855.md) between
the earth and the sky, him to whom the waters belong <span
id="fr_899"></span>[5](#fn_856.md), who listens to appeals and makes the
waters flow and the plants grow up, to nourish animals and men, to
nourish the Aryan nations, to nourish the five kinds of animals <span
id="fr_900"></span>[6](#fn_857.md), and to help the faithful <span
id="fr_901"></span>[7](#fn_858.md).

44\. Satavaêsa comes down and flows between the earth and the sky, he to
whom the waters belong, who listens to appeals and makes the waters and
the plants grow up, fair, radiant, and full of

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

light, to nourish animals and men, to nourish the Aryan nations, to
nourish the five kinds of animals, and to help the faithful.

#### XII.

45\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful;
with helms of brass, with weapons of brass, with armour <span
id="fr_902"></span>[1](#fn_859.md) of brass; who struggle in the fights for
victory in garments of light, arraying the battles and bringing them
forwards, to kill thousands of Daêvas.

When the wind blows from behind them <span
id="fr_903"></span>[2](#fn_860.md) and brings their breath unto men,

46\. Then men know where blows the breath of victory: and they pay pious
homage unto the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, with
their hearts prepared and their arms uplifted.

47\. Whichever side they have been first worshipped in the fulness of
faith of a devoted heart <span id="fr_904"></span>[3](#fn_861.md), to that
side turn the awful Fravashis of the faithful, along with Mithra and
Rashnu and the awful cursing thought <span
id="fr_905"></span>[4](#fn_862.md) of the wise and the victorious wind.

48\. And those nations are smitten at one stroke by their fifties and
their hundreds, by their hundreds and their thousands, by their
thousands and their tens of thousands, by their tens of thousands and
their myriads of myriads, against which turn the awful Fravashis of the
faithful, along with Mithra and Rashnu, and the awful cursing thought of
the wise and the victorious wind.

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

#### XIII.

49\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
who come and go through the borough at the time of the
Hamaspathmaêdha <span id="fr_906"></span>[1](#fn_863.md); they go along
there for ten nights, asking thus <span id="fr_907"></span>[2](#fn_864.md):

50\. 'Who will praise us? Who will offer us a sacrifice? Who will
meditate upon us? Who will bless us <span
id="fr_908"></span>[3](#fn_865.md)? Who will receive us with meat and
clothes in his hand <span id="fr_909"></span>[4](#fn_866.md) and with a
prayer worthy of bliss <span id="fr_910"></span>[5](#fn_867.md)? Of which
of us will the name be taken for invocation <span
id="fr_911"></span>[6](#fn_868.md)? Of which of you will the soul be
worshipped by you with a sacrifice <span
id="fr_912"></span>[7](#fn_869.md)? To whom will this gift of ours be
given, that he may have never-failing food for ever and ever?'

51\. And the man who offers them up a sacrifice,

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

with meat and clothes in his hand, with a prayer worthy of bliss, the
awful Fravashis of the faithful, satisfied, unharmed, and unoffended,
bless thus:

52\. 'May there be in this house flocks of animals and men! May there be
a swift horse and a solid chariot! May there be a man who knows how to
praise God <span id="fr_913"></span>[1](#fn_870.md) and rule in an
assembly, who will offer us sacrifices with meat and clothes in his
hand, and with a prayer worthy of bliss <span
id="fr_914"></span>[2](#fn_871.md).'

#### XIV.

53\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
who show beautiful paths to the waters, made by Mazda, which had stood
before for a long time in the same place without flowing <span
id="fr_915"></span>[3](#fn_872.md):

54\. And now they flow along the path made by Mazda, along the way made
by the gods, the watery way appointed to them, at the wish of Ahura
Mazda, at the wish of the Amesha-Spe*n*tas.

#### XV.

55\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
who show a beautiful growth to the fertile <span
id="fr_916"></span>[4](#fn_873.md) plants, which had stood before for a
long time in the same place without growing:

56\. And now they grow up along the path made

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

by Mazda, along the way made by the gods, in the time appointed to them,
at the wish of Ahura Mazda, at the wish of the Amesha-Spe*n*tas.

#### XVI.

57\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
who showed their paths to the stars, the moon, the sun, and the endless
lights, that had stood before for a long time in the same place, without
moving forwards, through the oppression of the Daêvas and the assaults
of the Daêvas <span id="fr_917"></span>[1](#fn_874.md).

58\. And now they move around in their far-revolving circle for ever,
till they come to the time of the good restoration of the world.

#### XVII.

59\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
who watch over the bright sea Vouru-Kasha <span
id="fr_918"></span>[2](#fn_875.md), to the number of ninety thousand, and
nine thousand, and nine hundred, and ninety-nine.

#### XVIII.

60\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
who watch over the stars Haptôiri*n*ga <span
id="fr_919"></span>[3](#fn_876.md), to the number of ninety thousand, and
nine thousand, and nine hundred, and ninety-nine.

#### XIX.

61\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
who watch over the body

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

of Keresâspa, the son of Sâma <span id="fr_920"></span>[1](#fn_877.md), the
club-bearer with plaited hair, to the number of ninety thousand, and
nine thousand, and nine hundred, and ninety-nine.

#### XX.

62\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
who watch over the seed of the holy Zarathu*s*tra <span

expressed by words; who run by tens of thousands into the midst of the

Zarathu*s*tra! along with the Glory made by Mazda <span
id="fr_923"></span>[1](#fn_880.md), then forwards come the awful Fravashis
of the faithful, many and many hundreds, many and many thousands, many
and many tens of thousands,

66\. Seeking water for their own kindred, for their own borough, for
their own town, for their own country, and saying thus: 'May our own
country have a good store and full joy!'

67\. They fight in the battles that are fought in their own place and
land, each according to the place and house where he dwelt (of
yore) <span id="fr_924"></span>[2](#fn_881.md): they look like a gallant
warrior who, girded up and watchful, fights for the hoard he has
treasured up.

their own borough, to their own town, to their own country, saying thus:

keep him in front, from the Dru*g* unseen, from the female Varenya

all death, Angra Mainyu. It will be as if there were a thousand men
watching over one man <span id="fr_925"></span>[1](#fn_882.md);

72\. So that neither the sword well-thrust, neither the club
well-falling, nor the arrow well-shot, nor the spear well-darted, nor
the stones flung from the arm shall destroy him.

73\. They come on this side, they come on that side, never resting, the
good, powerful, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, asking for help
thus: 'Who will praise us? Who will offer us a sacrifice? Who will
meditate upon us? Who will bless us? Who will receive us with meat and
clothes in his hand and with a prayer worthy of bliss? Of which of us
will the name be taken for invocation? Of which of you will the soul be

then came in across [Vohû](errata.htm#2.md) Manô and Âtar <span
id="fr_932"></span>[3](#fn_889.md).

cold-hearted man; who first in the material world pronounced the praise
of Asha <span id="fr_954"></span>[6](#fn_911.md), thus bringing the Daêvas

the Amesha-Spe*n*tas! May they not leave this house of us, the
worshippers of Mazda, complaining!

158\. Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . .
. .

I bless the sacrifice and prayer, and the strength and vigour of the
awful, overpowering Fravashis of the faithful; of the Fravashis of the
men of the primitive law; of the Fravashis of the next-of-kin.

Ashem Vohû.: Holiness is the best of all good. . . .

\[Give\] unto that man <span id="fr_1092"></span>[1](#fn_1034.md)
brightness and glory, . . . . give him the bright, all-happy, blissful
abode of the holy Ones.

to the dead; the Romans in February 'qui tunc extremus anni mensis erat'
(Cicero, De Legibus, II, 21), the Athenians on the third day of the
Anthesterion feast (in the same month). The souls of the dead were
supposed to partake of the new life then beginning to circulate through

*Hv*yaonas (ibid. and XIX, 87). The Hunus have been compared with the
Hunni; but it is not certain that this is a proper name; it may be a
disparaging denomination, meaning the brood (hunu = Sansk. sûnu; cf. Yt.
X, 113).

<span id="fn_928"></span>[205:5](sbe2318.htm#fr_973.md) Zarîr, the brother
of Vî*s*tâspa and son of Aurva*t*-aspa (see Yt. V, 112). The ten
following seem to be the names of the other sons of Aurva*t*-aspa (Bund.
XXXI, 29).

<span id="fn_929"></span>[205:6](sbe2318.htm#fr_974.md) Possibly the same
with Pât-Khosrav, a brother to Vî*s*tâspa in the Yâ*d*kâr-î Zarîrân, as
Mr. West informs me.

<span id="fn_930"></span>[206:1](sbe2318.htm#fr_975.md) Gustahm, the son of
Nodar; see Yt. V, 76. Strangely enough, Tusa is not mentioned here,
unless he is the same with one of the preceding names: possibly the
words 'the son of Naotara' (Naotairyâna) refer to all the four.

<span id="fn_931"></span>[206:2](sbe2318.htm#fr_976.md) Possibly
Frashîdvard <span id="img_20600"></span> ![](img/20600.jpg) (misspelt

![](img/20601.jpg) (?); the Yâ*d*kâr-î Zarîrân, as Mr. West informs me,
has <span id="img_20602"></span> ![](img/20602.jpg) and <span
id="img_20603"></span> ![](img/20603.jpg)). Frashîdvard was a son of
Gu*s*tâsp: he was killed by one of Ar*g*âsp's heroes and avenged by his
brother Isfendyâr (Spe*ñ*tô-dâta). The following names would belong to
his brothers: most of them contain the word Âtar, in honour of the
newly-adopted worship of fire.

<span id="fn_932"></span>[207:1](sbe2318.htm#fr_977.md) Isfendyâr, the
heroic son of Gû*s*tâsp, killed by Rustem.

<span id="fn_933"></span>[207:2](sbe2318.htm#fr_978.md) In the Yâ*d*kâr-î
Zarîrân, according to Mr. West, Bastvar, the son of Zairivairi, whose
death he avenges on his murderer Vîdraf*s*. This makes Bastavairi
identical with the Nastûr <span id="img_20700"></span>
![](img/20700.jpg) of Firdausi (read Bastûr <span id="img_20701"></span>
![](img/20701.jpg)).

<span id="fn_934"></span>[207:3](sbe2318.htm#fr_979.md) Kavârazem is the
Gurezm of later tradition (<span id="img_20702"></span>
![](img/20702.jpg)), 'the jealous brother of Isfendyâr, whom he
slandered to his father and caused to be thrown into prison' (Burhân
qâti’h). Firdausi (IV, 432) has only that he was a relation to
Gû*s*tâsp: <span id="img_20703"></span> ![](img/20703.jpg). See Études
Iraniennes, II, 230.

<span id="fn_940"></span>[208:4](sbe2318.htm#fr_985.md) Aêthrapati, in
Parsi hêrbad, a priest, whose special function is to teach; his pupils
were called aêthrya. Aêthrapati meant literally 'the master of the
hearth' (cf. hêrkodah, fire-temple). Hamidhpati is literally 'the master
of the sacrificial log.'

<span id="fn_941"></span>[208:5](sbe2318.htm#fr_986.md) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_942"></span>[208:6](sbe2318.htm#fr_987.md) No temporal lord

of the Sassanian times, and traced its origin to the time of Gû*s*tâsp
(Noeldeke, Geschichte der Perser zur Zeit der Sasaniden, p. 437).

<span id="fn_947"></span>[209:3](sbe2318.htm#fr_992.md) Cf. Yt. V, 64.

117, 128.

<span id="fn_952"></span>[211:2](sbe2318.htm#fr_999.md) Possibly, 'the holy
Hãm-baretar vanghvãm, the son of Takhma.' His name means, 'the gatherer

<span id="fn_960"></span>[213:1](sbe2318.htm#fr_1007.md) There are two men

<span id="fn_967"></span>[216:3](sbe2318.htm#fr_1014.md) Paitisrîra is
perhaps an epithet (most beautiful?), added to distinguish Paêshatah
from the hero mentioned in § 115.

<span id="fn_968"></span>[216:4](sbe2318.htm#fr_1015.md) An allusion to
some legend of domestic feud of which Paêshatah was the hero.

<span id="fn_969"></span>[216:5](sbe2318.htm#fr_1016.md) The high-priest of
