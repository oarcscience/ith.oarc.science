# YA*S*TS AND SÎRÔZAHS.

THE word ya*s*t, in Zend yê*s*ti, means properly 'the act of
worshipping,' the performance of the yasna; and it is often used in
Parsi tradition as synonymous with yasna. But it has also been
particularly applied to a certain number of writings in which the
several Izeds are praised and magnified. These writings are generally of
a higher poetical and epical character than the rest of the Avesta, and
are most valuable records of the old mythology and historical legends of
Iran.

The Parsis believe that formerly every Amshaspand and every Ized had his
particular Ya*s*t, but we now possess only twenty Ya*s*ts and fragments
of another <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md). The writings known as
Ya*s*t fragments, the Âfrîn Zartu*s*t, and Vî*s*tâsp Ya*s*t (printed as
Ya*s*ts XXI, XXII, XXIII, XXIV in Westergaard's edition), are not proper
Ya*s*ts, and have no liturgical character; they are not devoted to the
praise of any Ized.

The order in which the Ya*s*ts have been arranged by the Parsis follows
exactly the order of the Sîrôzah, which is the proper introduction to
the Ya*s*ts.

#### SÎRÔZAH.

Sîrôzah means 'thirty days:' it is the name of a prayer composed of
thirty invocations addressed to the several Izeds who preside over the
thirty days of the month.

There are two Sîrôzahs, but the only difference between them is that the
formulas in the former are shorter <span id="fr_3"></span>[2](#fn_3.md),
and there is also, occasionally, some difference in the epithets, which
are fuller in the latter.

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

In India the Sîrôzah is recited in honour of the dead, on the thirtieth
day after the death, on the thirtieth day of the sixth month, on the
thirtieth day of the twelfth month, and then every year on the thirtieth
day from the anniversary day (Anquetil, Zend-Avesta, II, 315).

The correspondence between the formulas of the Sîrôzah and the Ya*s*ts
is as follows:

The Ya*s*ts that have been lost are, therefore, those of
Khshathra-vairya, Spe*n*ta-Ârmaiti, Ameretâ*t*, Âtar, Vâta, Asman,
Mãthra-Spe*n*ta, and Anaghra rao*ka*u. The second Ya*s*t, or Ya*s*t of
the seven Amshaspands, appears to have been no independent Ya*s*t: it
was common to all the seven Ya*s*ts devoted to the several

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Amshaspands, and,
accordingly, it is recited on the first seven days of the month. One
might suppose that it was originally a part of the Ormazd Ya*s*t, as the
Amesha-Spe*n*tas are invoked in company with Ahura Mazda (Sîrôzah 1, 8,
15, 23). There may, indeed, have been several Ya*s*ts for one and the
same formula of the Sîrôzah, as in all of these formulas more than one
Ized are invoked: this would apply not only to the Ya*s*t of the seven
Amshaspands, but also to the Vana*nt* Ya*s*t (Ya*s*t XX), which, in that
case, ought to follow the Tîr Ya*s*t (see Sîrôzah 13).

Not every Ya*s*t, however, is devoted to the Ized whose name it bears:
thus the Ardibehe*s*t Ya*s*t is mostly devoted to Airyaman; the
Râm-Ya*s*t and the Zemyâd-Ya*s*t are devoted to Vayu and to the
*Hv*arenô: but Airyaman, Vayu, and the *Hv*arenô are invoked in the same
Sîrôzah formulas as Ardibehe*s*t, Râm, and Zemyâd, and a Ya*s*t is named
from the opening name in the correspondent Sîrôzah formula.

The systematic order so apparent in the Sîrôzah pervades the rest of the
liturgy to a great extent: the enumeration of Izeds in Yasna XVII, 12-4a
(XVI, 3-6) follows exactly the order of the Sîrôzah, except that it
gives only the first name of each formula; and the question may be
raised whether this passage in the Yasna is taken from the Sîrôzah, or
whether the Sîrôzah is developed from the Yasna.

The very idea of the Sîrôzah, that is to say the attribution of each of
the thirty days of the month to certain gods, seems to have been
borrowed from the Semites: the tablets found in the library of
Assurbanipal contain an Assyrian Sîrôzah, that is, a complete list of
the Assyrian gods that preside over the thirty days of the month <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2"></span>[1:1](sbe2303.htm#fr_2.md) The Bahman Ya*s*t (see
Yt. I, §§ 24 and following).

<span id="fn_3"></span>[1:2](sbe2303.htm#fr_3.md) In the greater Sîrôzah
the names of the gods invoked are introduced with the word yazamaidê,
'we sacrifice to;' in the lesser Sîrôzah there is no introductory word,
the word khshnaothra, 'propitiation,' being understood, as can be seen
from the introductory formulas to the several Ya*s*ts.
