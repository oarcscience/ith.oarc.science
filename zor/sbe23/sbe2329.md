#### XXIV. VÎ*S*TÂSP YA*S*T.

#### I.

1\. 'I am a pious man, who speaks words of blessing,' thus said
Zarathu*s*tra to the young king Vî*s*tâspa <span
id="fr_1456"></span>[1](#fn_1388.md).—'She <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[2](#fn_1389.md) appears to me full of Glory, O
Zarathu*s*tra!'—'O young king Vî*s*tâspa! \[I bless thee <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[3](#fn_1390.md)\] with the living of a good life, of
an exalted life, of a long life. May thy men live long! May thy women
live long! May sons be born unto thee of thy own body <span
id="fr_1459"></span>[4](#fn_1391.md)!

2\. 'Mayest thou thyself <span id="fr_1460"></span>[5](#fn_1392.md) be
holy, like Zarathu*s*tra!

'Mayest thou be rich in cattle, like an Âthwyanide <span
id="fr_1461"></span>[6](#fn_1393.md)!

'Mayest thou be rich in horses, like Pouru*s*-aspa <span
id="fr_1462"></span>[7](#fn_1394.md)!

'Mayest thou have a good share of bliss <span
id="fr_1463"></span>[8](#fn_1395.md), like king Husravah!

'Mayest thou have strength to reach the Rangha, whose way lies afar, as
Vafra Navâza did <span id="fr_1464"></span>[9](#fn_1396.md).

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

3\. 'May ten sons be born of thy own body <span
id="fr_1465"></span>[1](#fn_1397.md)! three as Âthravans <span
id="fr_1466"></span>[2](#fn_1398.md), three as warriors <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[3](#fn_1399.md), three as tillers of the ground <span
id="fr_1468"></span>[4](#fn_1400.md)! May one of them be like
*G*âmâspa <span id="fr_1469"></span>[5](#fn_1401.md), that he may bless
thee with great and ever greater happiness <span
id="fr_1470"></span>[6](#fn_1402.md)!

4\. 'Mayest thou be freed from sickness and death, like Peshô-tanu <span
id="fr_1471"></span>[7](#fn_1403.md).

'Mayest thou have piercing rays, like Mithra!

'Mayest thou be warm, like the moon!

'Mayest thou be <span id="fr_1472"></span>[8](#fn_1404.md) resplendent,
like fire!

'Mayest thou be long-lived, as long-lived as an old man can be <span
id="fr_1473"></span>[9](#fn_1405.md)!

5\. 'And when thou hast fulfilled a duration of a thousand years,
\[mayest thou obtain\] the bright, all-happy, blissful abode of the holy
Ones!

'Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

#### II.

6 <span id="fr_1474"></span>[1](#fn_1406.md). 'Give <span
id="fr_1475"></span>[2](#fn_1407.md) him strength and victory! Give him
welfare in cattle and bread <span id="fr_1476"></span>[3](#fn_1408.md)!'
thus said Zarathu*s*tra to the young king Vî*s*tâspa! 'Give him a great
number <span id="fr_1477"></span>[4](#fn_1409.md) of male children,
praisers <span id="fr_1478"></span>[5](#fn_1410.md) \[of God\] and chiefs
in assemblies, who smite and are not smitten, who smite at one stroke
their enemies, who smite at one stroke their foes, ever in joy and ready
to help.

7\. 'Ye gods of full Glory, ye gods of full healing, let your greatness
become manifest!'

8\. Zarathu*s*tra addressed him, saying: 'O young king Vî*s*tâspa! May
their greatness become manifest as it is called for!

'Ye Waters, impart and give your Glory to the man who offers you a
sacrifice!

'This is the boon we beg (for thee) of Ashi Vanguhi <span
id="fr_1479"></span>[6](#fn_1411.md), of Râta <span
id="fr_1480"></span>[7](#fn_1412.md), with eyes of love.'

9\. Pâre*n*di <span id="fr_1481"></span>[8](#fn_1413.md), of the light
chariot, follows: 'Mayest thou <span id="fr_1482"></span>[9](#fn_1414.md)
become manifest unto him, the young king Vî*s*tâspa!

'May plenty dwell in this house, standing upon high columns and rich in
food <span id="fr_1483"></span>[10](#fn_1415.md)! Thou wilt never

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

offer and give bad food to a priest: for a priest must be to thee like
the brightest <span id="fr_1484"></span>[1](#fn_1416.md) offspring of thy
own blood.'

10\. Zarathu*s*tra spake unto him: 'O young king Vî*s*tâspa!

'He who supports the Law of the worshippers of Mazda, as a brother or as
a friend, he who treats her friendly in any way, looks to keep off want
of food from her <span id="fr_1485"></span>[2](#fn_1417.md).'

11\. The holy Zarathu*s*tra preached that law to Frashao*s*tra <span
id="fr_1486"></span>[3](#fn_1418.md) and *G*âmâspa: 'May ye practise
holiness and thrive, O young Frashao*s*tra (and *G*âmâspa)!'

12\. Thus said Ahura Mazda unto the holy Zarathu*s*tra, and thus again
did Zarathu*s*tra say unto the young king Vî*s*tâspa: 'Have no bad
priests or unfriendly priests; for bad priests or unfriendly priests
will bring about much harm, and, though thou wish to sacrifice, it will
be to the Amesha-Spe*n*tas as if no sacrifice had been offered <span
id="fr_1487"></span>[4](#fn_1419.md).

'Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

#### III.

13\. 'When I teach thee, that thou mayest do the same to thy son <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[5](#fn_1420.md), O Vî*s*tâspa! receive thou well that
teaching; that will make thee rich in children and rich in milk; rich in
seed, in fat, in milk <span id="fr_1489"></span>[6](#fn_1421.md).

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

14\. 'Thus do we announce unto thee, Ahura Mazda, and Sraosha, and Ashi,
and the Law of the worshippers of Mazda, with the whole of all her
hymns, with the whole of all her deeds, with the whole of her
performances; the Law of Mazda, who obtains her wishes, who makes the
world grow, who listens to the songs and rejoices the faithful man at
his wish; who protects the faithful man, who maintains the faithful man;

15\. 'From whom come the knowledge of holiness and the increase in
holiness of the world of the holy Principle, and without whom <span
id="fr_1490"></span>[1](#fn_1422.md) no faithful man <span
id="fr_1491"></span>[2](#fn_1423.md) can know holiness.

'To thee <span id="fr_1492"></span>[3](#fn_1424.md) come every Hâvanan,
every Âtare-vakhsha, every Frabaretar, every Âbere*t*, every Âsnâtar,
every Rathwi*s*kar, every Sraoshâ-varez <span
id="fr_1493"></span>[4](#fn_1425.md);

16\. 'Every priest, every warrior, every husbandman; every master of a
house, every lord of a borough, every lord of a town, every lord of a
province;

17\. 'Every youth of good thoughts, good words, good deeds, and good
religion; every youth who speaks the right words; every one who performs
the next-of-kin marriage <span id="fr_1494"></span>[5](#fn_1426.md); every
itinerant priest; every mistress of a house; every wandering priest,
obedient to the Law.

18\. 'To thee come all the performers <span
id="fr_1495"></span>[6](#fn_1427) (of holiness.md), all the masters of
holiness, who, to the

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

number of three and thirty <span id="fr_1496"></span>[1](#fn_1428.md),
stand next to Hâvani, being masters of holiness.

19\. 'May they be fully protected <span
id="fr_1497"></span>[2](#fn_1429.md) in thee, O young king Vî*s*tâspa!
While thou smitest thy adversaries, thy foes, those who hate thee, a
hundred times a hundred for a hundred <span
id="fr_1498"></span>[3](#fn_1430.md), a thousand times a thousand for a
thousand, ten thousand times ten thousand for ten thousand, myriads of
myriads for a myriad.

20\. 'Proclaim thou that word, as we did proclaim it unto thee!

'O Maker of the good world! Ahura Mazda, I worship thee with a
sacrifice, I worship and forward thee with a sacrifice, I worship this
creation of Ahura Mazda.'

21 <span id="fr_1499"></span>[4](#fn_1431.md). The young king Vî*s*tâspa
asked Zarathu*s*tra: 'With what manner of sacrifice shall I worship,
with what manner of sacrifice shall I worship and forward this creation
of Ahura Mazda?'

22\. Zarathu*s*tra answered: 'We will make it known unto thee, O young
king Vî*s*tâspa!

'Go towards that tree that is beautiful, high-growing, and mighty
amongst the high-growing trees, and say thou these words: "Hail to thee!
O good, holy tree, made by Mazda! Ashem Vohû!"

23\. 'Let the faithful man cut off twigs of baresma, either one, or two,
or three: let him bind them and

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

tie them up according to the rites, being bound and unbound according to
the rites.

'The smallest twig of Haoma, pounded according to the rules, the
smallest twig prepared for sacrifice, gives royalty to the man (who does
it).'

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

#### IV.

24 <span id="fr_1500"></span>[1](#fn_1432.md). Zarathu*s*tra said: 'O young
king Vî*s*tâspa!

'Invoke Ahura Mazda, who is full of Glory, Ahura Mazda, and the
sovereign Heaven, the boundless Time, and Vayu who works highly.

25\. 'Invoke the powerful Wind, made by Mazda, and Fate.

'Repeat thou those words, that the god invoked may give thee the boon
wished for; that thou, strong, and belonging to the creation of the good
Spirit, mayest smite and take away the Dru*g* and watch with full
success those who hate thee; smite down thy foes, and destroy at one
stroke thy adversaries, thy enemies, and those who hate thee <span
id="fr_1501"></span>[2](#fn_1433.md).

26\. 'Proclaim thou those prayers: they will cleanse thy body from deeds
of lust <span id="fr_1502"></span>[3](#fn_1434.md), O young king
Vî*s*tâspa!

'I will worship thee, O Fire, son of Ahura Mazda, who art a valiant
warrior. He falls upon the fiend Ku*n*da <span
id="fr_1503"></span>[4](#fn_1435.md), who is drunken without drinking, upon
the men of the Dru*g*, the slothful ones <span
id="fr_1504"></span>[5](#fn_1436.md), the wicked Daêva-worshippers, who
live in sin.

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

27\. 'He <span id="fr_1505"></span>[1](#fn_1437.md) trembles at the
way <span id="fr_1506"></span>[2](#fn_1438.md) made by Time and open both
to the wicked and to the righteous.

'They <span id="fr_1507"></span>[3](#fn_1439.md) tremble at the perfume of
his soul <span id="fr_1508"></span>[4](#fn_1440.md), as a sheep does on
which a wolf is falling.

 

28\. 'Reciting the whole collection of the Staota Yêsnya <span
id="fr_1509"></span>[5](#fn_1441.md) prayers brings one up all the way to
the blessed Garô-nmâna, the palace beautifully made. That indeed is the
way.

 

29\. 'That man does not follow the way of the Law, O Zarathu*s*tra <span
id="fr_1510"></span>[6](#fn_1442)! who commits the Baodhô-(var*s*ta.md)
crime <span id="fr_1511"></span>[7](#fn_1443.md) with a damsel and an old
woman <span id="fr_1512"></span>[8](#fn_1444.md),' said Zarathu*s*tra to
the young king Vî*s*tâspa.

'Let him <span id="fr_1513"></span>[9](#fn_1445.md) praise the Law, O
Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! and long for it and embrace the whole of the Law,
as an excellent horse turns back from the wrong way and goes along the
right one, smiting the many Dru*g*es <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[10](#fn_1446.md).

30\. 'Go forward with praises, go forward the way of the good Mazdean
law and of all those who walk in her ways, men and women.

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

'He who wishes to seize the heavenly reward <span
id="fr_1515"></span>[1](#fn_1447.md), will seize it by giving gifts to him
who holds up (the Law) to us <span id="fr_1516"></span>[2](#fn_1448.md) in
this world here below <span id="fr_1517"></span>[3](#fn_1449.md) . . .

31\. 'Let him <span id="fr_1518"></span>[4](#fn_1450) give (the Law.md) to
him who is unfriendly to her, that he may become friendly.

'Wash thy hands with water, not with gômêz <span
id="fr_1519"></span>[5](#fn_1451.md), and let thy son, who will be born of
thy wife <span id="fr_1520"></span>[6](#fn_1452.md), do the same.

'Thus thy thought will be powerful to smite him <span
id="fr_1521"></span>[7](#fn_1453.md), who is not so <span
id="fr_1522"></span>[8](#fn_1454.md); thy speech will be powerful to smite
him, who is not so; thy deed will be powerful to smite him.

32\. ' "Hear me! Forgive me <span
id="fr_1523"></span>[9](#fn_1455.md)!"—We, the Amesha-Spe*n*tas, will come
and show thee, O Zarathu*s*tra! the way to that world <span
id="fr_1524"></span>[10](#fn_1456.md), to long glory in the spiritual
world, to long happiness of the soul in Paradise;

33\. 'To bliss and Paradise, to the Garô-nmâna of Ahura Mazda,
beautifully made and fully adorned,

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

when his soul goes out of his body through the will of fate, when I,
Ahura Mazda, when I, Ahura Mazda, gently show him his way as he asks for
it.

'Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

#### V.

34\. 'They <span id="fr_1525"></span>[1](#fn_1457.md) will impart to thee
full brightness and Glory.

'They will give him <span id="fr_1526"></span>[2](#fn_1458.md) quick <span
id="fr_1527"></span>[3](#fn_1459.md) and swift horses, and good sons.

'He wishes to go to the Law, the young king Vî*s*tâspa.'

Zarathu*s*tra said: 'Let him who is unfriendly to her become a follower
of the Law of Mazda, such as we proclaim it.

35\. 'Proclaim thou ever (unto the poor): "Ever mayest thou wait here
for the refuse that is brought unto thee, brought by those who have
profusion of wealth <span id="fr_1528"></span>[4](#fn_1460.md)!" Thus the
Dru*g* will not fall upon thee and throw thee away; thou wilt wield
kingly power there <span id="fr_1529"></span>[5](#fn_1461.md).

36\. 'The Law of Mazda will not deliver thee unto pain <span
id="fr_1530"></span>[6](#fn_1462). Thou art entreated (for charity.md) by
the whole of the living world, and she <span
id="fr_1531"></span>[7](#fn_1463.md) is ever standing at thy door in the
person of thy brethren in the faith: beggars are ever standing at the
door of the stranger, amongst those who beg for bread.

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

'Ever will that bread be burning coal upon thy head <span
id="fr_1532"></span>[1](#fn_1464.md).

'The good, holy Râta <span id="fr_1533"></span>[2](#fn_1465.md), made by
Mazda, goes and nurses thy bright offspring <span
id="fr_1534"></span>[3](#fn_1466.md).'

37\. Zarathu*s*tra addressed Vî*s*tâspa, saying: 'O young king
Vî*s*tâspa! The Law of Mazda, O my son! will give thy offspring the
victorious strength that destroys the fiends.

'Let no thought of Angra Mainyu ever infect thee, so that thou shouldst
indulge in evil lusts, make derision and idolatry, and shut (to the
poor) the door of thy house <span id="fr_1535"></span>[4](#fn_1467.md).

38 <span id="fr_1536"></span>[5](#fn_1468.md). 'Âtar thus blesses the man
who brings incense to him, being pleased with him and not angry, and fed
as he required: "May herds of oxen grow for thee, and increase of sons!
May fate and its decrees bring thee the boons thou wishest for!
Therefore do thou invoke and praise (me) excellently in this glorious
world! That I may have unceasing food, full of the glory of Mazda <span
id="fr_1537"></span>[6](#fn_1469.md) and with which I am well pleased."

39\. 'O Mazda! take for thyself the words of our praise: of these words
I speak and speak again, the strength and victorious vigour, the power
of health and healing, the fulness, increase, and growth.

'Bring it together with the words of hymns up to the Garô-nmâna of Ahura
Mazda. He will <span id="fr_1538"></span>[7](#fn_1470.md) first

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

enter there. Therefore do thou pronounce these prayers.

'Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

#### VI.

40\. 'Converse ye with the Amesha-Spe*n*tas,' said Zarathu*s*tra unto
the young king Vî*s*tâspa, and with the devout Sraosha, and
Nairyô-sangha, the tall-formed, and Âtar, the son of Ahura Mazda, and
the well-desired kingly Glory.

41\. 'Men with lustful deeds address the body <span
id="fr_1539"></span>[1](#fn_1471.md); but thou, all the night long, address
the heavenly Wisdom <span id="fr_1540"></span>[2](#fn_1472.md); but thou,
all night long, call for the Wisdom that will keep thee awake.

'Three times a day raise thyself up and go to take care of the
beneficent cattle.

42\. 'Of these men may the lordship <span
id="fr_1541"></span>[3](#fn_1473.md) belong to the wisest of all beings, O
Zarathu*s*tra! May their lord belong to the wisest, O Zarathu*s*tra! Let
him show them the way of holiness, let him show them at once the way
thereto, which the Law of the worshippers of Mazda enters victoriously.
Thus the soul of man, in the joy of perfect holiness, walks over the
bridge, known afar, the powerful *K*inva*t*-bridge <span
id="fr_1542"></span>[4](#fn_1474.md), the well-kept, and kept by virtue.

43\. 'How the worlds were arranged was said to thee first, O
Zarathu*s*tra! Zarathu*s*tra said it again to the young king Vî*s*tâspa;
therefore do thou <span id="fr_1543"></span>[5](#fn_1475.md) praise
him <span id="fr_1544"></span>[6](#fn_1476.md) who keeps and maintains the
moon and the sun.

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

'He who has little friendship for the Law, I have placed him down below
to suffer.'

44\. Thus said Angra Mainyu, he who has no Glory in him, who is full of
death: 'This is an unbeliever, let us throw him down below; this is a
liar, or a traitor to his relatives, and like a mad dog who wounds
cattle and men; but the dog who inflicts wounds pays for it as for
wilful murder <span id="fr_1545"></span>[1](#fn_1477.md).

'The first time he shall smite a faithful man, the first time he shall
wound a faithful man, he shall pay for it as for wilful murder.

'Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

#### VII.

45\. 'Mayest thou receive <span id="fr_1546"></span>[2](#fn_1478.md), O
holy young king Vî*s*tâspa! (a house) with a hundred . . . . <span
id="fr_1547"></span>[3](#fn_1479.md), ten thousand large windows, ten
thousand small windows, all the year long <span
id="fr_1548"></span>[4](#fn_1480.md), O holy Vî*s*tâspa! never growing old,
never dying, never decaying, never rotting, giving plenty of meat,
plenty of food, plenty of clothes to the other worshippers of Mazda.

46\. 'May all boons be bestowed upon thee, as I proclaim it unto thee!
May the Amesha-Spe*n*tas impart to thee their brightness and glory and
plenty <span id="fr_1549"></span>[5](#fn_1481.md)! May they give him quick
and swift horses and good sons, strong, great in all things, powerful to
sing the hymns.

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

47\. 'He wields his power according to the wish of Ahura Mazda, the Good
Spirit, and for the destruction of the Evil Spirit, whichever of two men
goes quicker to perform a sacrifice (to Ahura); but if he chooses to
perform the sacrifice and prayer to us not in the right way, he does not
wield the right power, he will not reign <span
id="fr_1550"></span>[1](#fn_1482.md).

48\. 'He will receive bad treatment in the next world, though he has
been the sovereign of a country, with good horses to ride and good
chariots to drive. Give royalty to that man, O Zarathu*s*tra! who gives
royalty unto thee with good will <span
id="fr_1551"></span>[2](#fn_1483.md).

 

49 <span id="fr_1552"></span>[3](#fn_1484.md). 'Thou shalt keep away the
evil by this holy spell: "Of thee \[O child!\] I will cleanse the birth
and growth; of thee \[O woman!\] I will make the body and the strength
pure; I make thee a woman rich in children and rich in milk; a woman
rich in seed, in milk, and in offspring. For thee I shall make springs
run and flow towards the pastures that will give food to the child."

50\. 'Do not deliver me <span id="fr_1553"></span>[4](#fn_1485.md) into the
hands of the fiend <span id="fr_1554"></span>[5](#fn_1486.md); if the fiend
take hold of me, then fever with loss of all joy will dry up the milk of
the good Spe*n*ta-Ârmaiti <span id="fr_1555"></span>[6](#fn_1487.md). The
fiend is powerful to distress, and to dry up the milk of the woman who
indulges in lust and of all females.

51\. 'The perfume of fire, pleasant to the Maker,

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ahura Mazda, takes
them <span id="fr_1556"></span>[1](#fn_1488.md) away from afar; . . .

creation of the Good Spirit are destroyed <span
id="fr_1558"></span>[3](#fn_1490.md);

52\. 'Whom Mithra, and Rashnu Razi*s*ta, and the Law of the worshippers
of Mazda wish to be taken far away, longing for a man who is eager to
perform and does perform the ceremonies he has been taught; . . . <span
id="fr_1559"></span>[4](#fn_1491.md)

'Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

#### VIII <span id="fr_1560"></span>[5](#fn_1492.md).

53\. 'The words of the Vahi*s*tôi*s*ti <span
id="fr_1561"></span>[6](#fn_1493.md) Gâtha are to be sung: "Happy is he, O
holy Vî*s*tâspa! happy the man, whoever he be, to whom Ahura Mazda gives
the full accomplishment of his wishes."

'Where does his soul abide on that night <span
id="fr_1562"></span>[7](#fn_1494.md)?'

54\. Ahura Mazda answered: 'O my son, Frashao*s*tra! It takes its seat
near the head, singing the U*s*tavaiti Gâtha and proclaiming happiness:
"Happy is he, happy the man whoever he be!"

'On the first night, his soul sits in Good Words <span
id="fr_1563"></span>[8](#fn_1495.md);

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

on the second night, it sits in Good Deeds; on the third night, it goes
along the ways (to Garô-nmâna).

55\. 'At the end of the third night, O my son, Frashao*s*tra! when the
dawn appears, it seems to the soul of the faithful one as if it were
brought amidst plants \[and scents: it seems as if a wind were blowing
from the region of the south, from the regions of the south\] <span
id="fr_1564"></span>[1](#fn_1496.md), a sweet-scented wind, sweeter-scented
than any other wind in the world, and it seems to his soul as if he were
inhaling that wind with the nose, and it asks, saying: "Whence does that
wind blow, the sweetest-scented wind I ever inhaled with my nose?"

56\. 'And it seems to him as if his own conscience were advancing to him
in that wind, in the shape of a maiden fair, bright, white-armed,
strong, tall-formed, high-standing, thick-breasted, beautiful of body,
noble, of a glorious seed, of the size of a maid in her fifteenth year,
as fair as the fairest things in the world.

57\. 'And the soul of the faithful one addressed her, asking: "What maid
art thou, who art the fairest maid I have ever seen?"

58\. 'And she, being his own conscience, answers him: "O thou youth, of
good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, of good religion! I am thy
own conscience.

' "Everybody did love thee for that greatness, goodness, fairness,
sweet-scentedness, victorious strength, and freedom from sorrow, in
which thou

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

dost appear to me; \[and so thou, O youth of good thoughts, good words,
and good deeds, of good religion! didst love me for that greatness,
goodness, fairness, sweet-scentedness, victorious strength, and freedom
from sorrow, in which I appear to thee.

59\. ' "When thou wouldst see a man <span

idolatry, or rejecting (the poor) and shutting (his door), then, thou
wouldst sit, singing the Gâthas, and worshipping the good waters, and
Âtar, the son of Ahura Mazda, and rejoicing the faithful that would come
from near or from afar.

60\. ' "I was lovely, and thou madest me still lovelier; I was fair, and
thou madest me still fairer; I was desirable, and thou madest me still
more desirable; I was sitting in a forward place, and thou madest me sit
in the foremost place, through this good thought, through this good
speech, through this good deed of thine; and so henceforth men worship
me for my having long sacrificed unto and conversed with Ahura Mazda."

61\. 'The first step that the soul of the faithful man made, placed him
in the Good-Thought Paradise; the second step that the soul of the
faithful man made, placed him in the Good-Word Paradise; the third step
that the soul of the faithful man made, placed him in the Good-Deed
Paradise; the fourth step that the soul of the faithful man made, placed
him in the Endless Light.

62\. 'Then one of the faithful, who had departed before him, asked,
saying: "How didst thou depart this life, thou holy man? How didst thou
come,

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

thou holy man! from the abodes full of cattle and full of the wishes and
enjoyments of love? from the material world into the world of the
spirit? from the decaying world into the undecaying one? How long did
thy felicity last?" '

63\. And Ahura Mazda answered: 'Ask him not what thou askest him, who
has just gone the dreary way, full of fear and distress, when the body
and the soul part from one another.

64\. '\[Let him eat\] of the food brought to him, of the oil of
Zaremaya: this is the food for the youth of good thoughts, of good
words, of good deeds, of good religion, after he has departed this life;
this is the food for the holy woman, rich in good thoughts, good words,
and good deeds, well-principled, and obedient to her husband, after she
has departed this life.'

 

65\. Spitama Zarathu*s*tra said to the young king Vî*s*tâspa: 'To what
land shall I turn, O Ahura Mazda? To whom shall I go with praying <span
