### XXIII-XXIV. ÂFRÎN PAIGHAMBAR ZARTÛ*S*T AND VÎ*S*TÂSP YA*S*T.

'God taught the Zendávasta to Zartusht—a sublime work . . . . God said
to Zartusht, "Go and before Sháh Gushtásp read this book, that he may
come into the faith . . . . keep all my counsel and repeat it word by
word to Sháh Gushtásp <span id="fr_1427"></span>[1](#fn_1359.md)." '

Zartusht, in obedience to God, went to the court of Gushtásp: 'He came
forward and called down a blessing on the Shâh <span
id="fr_1428"></span>[2](#fn_1360.md).' Then he read to him the Zandávasta
and said: 'Learn its statutes and walk therein. If your desire is
towards its laws, your abode shall be in the paradise of heaven. But if
you turn away from its commandments, you shall bring down your crowned
head to the dust. Your God will be displeased with you, and will
overthrow your prosperous condition. At the last you shall descend into
hell, if you hear not the counsel of the Almighty <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[3](#fn_1361.md).'

These lines of the Zartusht-Namah are a summary of the following two
Ya*s*ts. The first, entitled 'The blessing of the prophet Zartû*s*t,'
contains the words of blessing addressed by Zarathu*s*tra when appearing
before the king. These words seem to have followed a similar blessing
pronounced by *G*âmâspa <span id="fr_1430"></span>[4](#fn_1362.md), the
prime minister of Vî*s*tâspa <span id="fr_1431"></span>[5](#fn_1363.md).

Ya*s*t XXIV contains the exhortations of the prophet to the king to
follow and closely adhere to the Law of Mazda. It is a counterpart to
the XIXth Fargard of the Vendîdâd, as Zarathu*s*tra plays here the same
part to Vî*s*tâspa as Ahura does there to Zarathu*s*tra. It is,
therefore, a summary of the Law, of the duties it

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

enforces and of the rewards it promises. This accounts for the strange
disconnection apparent in it, which makes it a crux interpretum, as,
besides the very corrupt state of the text, the chief difficulty of this
Ya*s*t arises from the fact that many passages in it are incomplete
quotations from the Vendîdâd, or allusions to statements therein <span
id="fr_1432"></span>[1](#fn_1364.md), which, when supplied, help a good
deal to relieve this Ya*s*t from its apparent state of utter
incoherence.

For this translation I was able to avail myself of a Pahlavi
translation, of which a copy was kindly lent to me by Mr. West. That
translation is apparently of late date and often manifestly wrong; yet
it was very useful to me in several passages, besides its giving a Zend
text generally more correct and more correctly divided than the text in
Westergaard's edition <span id="fr_1433"></span>[2](#fn_1365.md).

Ya*s*t XXIII was originally no independent Ya*s*t, being nothing more
than the beginning of Ya*s*t XXIV, detached from it, with one slight
alterations and inversions.

long! May sons be born unto thee of thy own body!

id="fr_1446"></span>[1](#fn_1378.md)! In three of them mayest thou be an
Âthravan! In three of them mayest thou be a warrior! In three of them
mayest thou be a tiller of the ground <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[2](#fn_1379.md)! And may one be like thyself, O
Vî*s*tâspa!

6\. 'Mayest thou be swift-horsed, like the Sun <span

'Mayest thou be hot-burning, like fire!

'Mayest thou have piercing rays, like Mithra!

'Mayest thou be tall-formed and victorious, like the devout
Sraosha <span id="fr_1449"></span>[4](#fn_1381.md)!

id="fr_1450"></span>[5](#fn_1382.md)!

'Mayest thou be a conqueror of thy foes, like Verethraghna <span

'Mayest thou have fulness of welfare, like Râma *Hv*âstra <span
id="fr_1452"></span>[7](#fn_1384.md)!

'Mayest thou be freed from sickness and death, like king Husravah <span
id="fr_1453"></span>[8](#fn_1385.md)!

8\. 'Then the blessing goes for the bright, all-happy, blissful abode of
the holy Ones <span id="fr_1454"></span>[9](#fn_1386.md).

'May it happen unto thee according to my blessing!

' <span id="fr_1455"></span>[10](#fn_1387.md) Let us embrace and propagate
the good thoughts, good words, and good deeds that have been done and
that will be done here and elsewhere, that we may be in the number of
the good.

bright, all-happy, blissful abode of the holy Ones.'
