## 82. THE COYOTE AND HIS PREY. <span id="fr_159"></span>[1](toth086.htm#fn_157.md)

Alíksai! At Hohóyapi the people were living. The Coyote had children
somewhere. So he was hunting some food for them and had killed a rabbit
and he did not want to eat it alone, so he mounted a bluff and called it
out in the way Coyotes bark. So from the north tame a yellow Coyote,
from the west a blue one, from the south a red one, from the east a
white, from the north east a black, and from the south east a gray one.
"This here I killed," he said to, them, "and because I do not want to
eat it alone I have called you. We shall eat it together." So they tore
it to pieces and devoured it there very quickly, and that is the reason
why a coyote never eats any prey that he has found alone, but always
calls out when he has found something.
