## 101.--THE DESTRUCTION OF PIVÁNHONK'API.

North of Oraíbi are living Yáyaponchatu. Village chief of Pivánhonk'api
is worried over degeneration of people, women even participating in
games of chance. Chief's wife neglects children when she gambles in
kiva. Chief goes to Yáyaponchatu, who are in league with supernatural
forces, to ask them to punish his people. They tell him to choose fire
or storm and he chooses fire. He invites them to dance in his village.
He tells chief of Hû'ckovi and his assistant to come in evening. They
come and chief tells them all about matter. On fourth day there are
seven of Katcina dances. Yáyaponchatu perform last dance. They sing
ominous song. Prayer-offerings carried by four of their dancers have
spark of fire over each husk packet. At conclusion of dance they hand
three of these prayer-offerings to village chief and to chief of
Hû'ckovi and his friend, fourth being retained by leader of Yáyaponchatu

dancers. In evening two chiefs and friend smoke over prayer-offerings
and friend takes one to San Francisco Mountains to deposit among trees
and high grass. Next night light is noticed in San Francisco Mountains.
Each night it is seen to be larger. Those watching become alarmed, but
their remarks are not listened to. During fourth night people continue
gambling and carousing, while fire begins to spread towards Hopi
village. People in kiva are asked to come out of kiva and see, but they
laugh. Finally one comes out and cries out to others. They rush out and
try to gather effects before fleeing, but most of them are suffocated or
burned to death. Only few escape from two villages.

Village chief of Oraíbi goes to house of Spider Woman. She tells him to
make two arrows, using on shafts feathers of certain birds. They are
thrust in ground west and north of village, and Spider Woman weaves
network of web between them, which she moistens with water. This breaks
force of fire and Oraíbi is saved.
