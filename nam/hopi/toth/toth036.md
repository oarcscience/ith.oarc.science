## 33. TWO YÁYAPONCHATU TRADE IN ORAÍBI. <span id="fr_85"></span>[2](#fn_83)

Halíksai! A long time ago the Oraíbi were living in Oraíbi. North of the
present peach orchards (about three-fourths of a mile north of Oraíbi),
lived the Yáyaponchatu. These are not Hopi, but they are beings
something like the skeletons. They have white faces and white bodies,
disheveled hair, and wear kilts of black and white striped cloth. They
understand the fire and more than once caused villages to be destroyed
by fire. They were the cause of the destruction

by fire of Pivánhonk'ape, and also one time of Oraíbi, when a great many
people perished.

The Oraíbi at that time did the same as they are doing now when they
want to barter. They would put the things they wanted to sell together
on a pile in a kiva, and then send some one around to the different
kivas to trade the things off for what they were in need of. One time
the Yáyaponchatu heard that the Oraíbi were again trading. They were out
of native tobacco (píva), so they sent two of their number to the
village to trade for some tobacco. West of the place where now
Nakwáyeshtiwa lives was then a kiva called Blue-bird Height
(Chórzhovi). <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](toth037.htm#fn_84)

To this kiva the two Yáyaponchatus came first. They laid down on the
roof of the kiva and let down the bunches of broom grass (wúhci), which
they had brought with them to trade. "I came to trade" (Nu buy!) they
said. "Have you come to trade something?'' answered those in the kiva,
"whee!" (with a rising inflection). "Very well," they said from the
kiva, "what is it that you want?" "Tobacco we want" (Tangúnache
wiwinche), they answered. The men in the kiva looked up and said, "What
is it? We do not understand you." Hereupon one of the Yáyaponchatu
whispered, "píva, píva, hut-hut-hut" (the latter words, however, were
spoken with an inhalation). "O," they said, "tobacco he wants." So one
of them, who had a supply, went and got some and gave it to one of the
barterers. They were happy over it.

The two now proceeded to the Móts kiva, which was located a few yards
west of the present Wíkolapi kiva, where the same exchange of words was
repeated that had taken place at the previous kiva. Here the second one
traded his broom grass for a sack of tobacco, whereupon the two returned
to their village, being happy over their purchase. Here in the village
they smoked the tobacco that they had obtained from the Oraíbi.
