Children find nest of Tû'chvos on bluff. Bull-snake has also discovered
nest. Snake is discovered by bird, who feels secure and sings jokingly
at snake. Snake is angry and tries to climb up. He falls back three
times, but fourth .time he reaches mouth of opening in which is nest. He
enters, coils up in nest, and devours four little ones. He remains in
nest four days and then crawls on bluff and coils up. Old bird flies
about bewailing loss of brood. Snake begins to exert charm on bird by
strong inhalations. Bird is drawn nearer and nearer towards snake on
each inhalation, although when it exhales bird tries to escape. Finally
it is drawn by strong inhalation close to Snake's mouth and then snake
devours its victim.
