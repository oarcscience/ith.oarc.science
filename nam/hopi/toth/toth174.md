## 61.--BÁLÖLÖOKONGWUU AND THE COYOTE.

Lölö'okong goes to visit his friend Coyote and is so long he fills kiva.
Coyote gives him juniper berries to eat. He invites Coyote to visit him
and leaves. Coyote thinks he will pay off his friend and makes
artificial tail of cedar bark and yucca leaves, which he fastens to his
own tail. He goes to his friend's house and fills whole kiva with his
long tail. They eat corn-pollen. They talk together until evening and
then Coyote goes home. When his tail is nearly unwound, Lölö'okong sets
fire to it. Tail sets grass on fire. When tail is nearly consumed,
Coyote reaches kiva and begins to think that his friend has so treated
him and becomes very angry with Lölö'okong .
