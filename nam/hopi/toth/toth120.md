## 7.--THE SNAKE MYTH.

Old men of Píhk'ash and Kókop clans wonder where Colorado River flows
They build box, put provisions and four báhos with young man into box,
and send it floating down river. When box will go no further young man
gets out. He sees water everywhere. In midst is house. Hurúing Wuhti
comes out and calls him four times. He goes to her house on road made by
corn-meal ball she rolls on water. In evening Hurúing Wuhti sends him
into side room Sun comes sitting on disk attached to pole. He is dressed
like Katcina. He assorts báhos offered him on course around earth and
throws those of bad people away. He takes bath and eats food. He then
goes into house under

earth on course again. In east he goes down in house. Hence bahos
offered to Sun are carried eastward to Sun shrines. There live Flutes of
Sun Clan, who always play and the Sun rises. Hence gray fox-skin is put
up at white dawn and yellow fox-skin at yellow dawn.
