## 31. MÁSAUWUU MARRIES A MAIDEN. <span id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_81.md)

Alíksai! In old Mishóngnovi they were living. At Mástopk'ave Másauwuu
lived with his grandmother, Mas Wuhti. In the village lived a beautiful
maiden who persistently refused all offers of marriage. So Másauwuu one
time went to pay her a visit. He came as a very handsome young man. She
was grinding corn when he entered her house. She invited him to sit
down, and asked who he was. He told her who he was. He had a great many
strands of beads around his neck and long turquoise ear-pendants in his
ears and was dressed up nicely. They were sitting on the opposite sides
of the fireplace and conversed with each other all the evening. She told
him that she would be willing to marry him.

The next morning she sent a large tray full of múhpiki (píki made of the
meal of young roasted corn-ears) to Másauwuu's grandmother, for which
the latter was very glad. She then told Másauwuu that from the gift
which the mána had sent she inferred that the mána was willing to marry
him. "Yes," he said, "and she asked whether I was rich, and I told her
yes; now what shall we pay her back for the presents that she has sent
us?" So his grandmother gave him a large quantity of rabbit meat, which
he wrapped up and carried over to the house of the maiden. She thanked
him for it and again

gave him something to eat. The next morning he came to her house and
took her over to his grandmother's house, where they lived forever
afterwards.
