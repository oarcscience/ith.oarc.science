## 68. THE COYOTE AND THE BLUE JAYS. <span id="fr_138"></span>[1](#fn_136.md)

Halíksai! A long time ago the people lived in Oraíbi. West of the
village, at Íshmovala, lived the Coyote and his wife. They had six
children and the Coyote used to go and hunt rabbits for his children.
One day he went hunting again and found a little cottontail rabbit,
which he chased. The rabbit ran into the hole, which the Coyote could
not enter. "How shall I get this rabbit out now?" he thought to himself;
then somebody came along; it was the Badger. "You get this out for me
here," the Coyote said, "I want this rabbit for my children to eat." So
the Coyote sat down and waited while the Badger scratched a hole until
he reached the rabbit, whereupon he pulled the latter out. The Coyote
was very happy. "Thus," he

said, "on your account my children will have something to eat." Then the
Coyote took the rabbit in his mouth and ran home with it, being very
happy. When he arrived in his home the little Coyotes wrangled over the
rabbit, tore it to pieces and devoured it, some of them getting
something, others not, so they remained hungry.

The next morning both the Coyote and his wife went out in search of food
again, the latter ascending up to the village, and ran past the village
on the west side, then by the north side, turning northward over the
mesas. Not finding anything, she finally entered the woods north of the
village. All at once she heard something in the trees, and, looking up,
she saw some Blue Jays in the tree. The Blue jays were dancing in the
tree and she coveted them. They said to the Coyote: "We are having a
dance here, you come and be with us and assist us." "I would like to,"
the Coyote said, "but how shall I get up there?" "Why, we shall lend you
some of our wings, tails, and feathers," the Blue jays said. "All
right," she said. So they took off some of their wings, tails, and
feathers and put them on her legs. They then told her that she must
dance and sing just the same as they did, and then they again began to
sing.

The Coyote now having wings ascended and danced with them. When they had
finished the song they all flew away, the Coyote with them, and alighted
on some other tree. This they repeated in all three times. They then
flew up high into the air, the Coyote with them, and when they were very
high up they all surrounded the Coyote, each one saying: "This is my
tail, this is my wing, these are my feathers," and then tore out all the
feathers that they had loaned the Coyote. When they had torn out all the
feathers the Coyote began to fall downward to the earth. When she
reached it she was dead.

Her children still had nothing to eat. When the Coyote father saw that
his wife was not coming home he concluded that he would go and hunt her.
Following her tracks, he ascended to the village, passed the village on
the west side, and when he reached the north side of the village the
dogs of the village noticed him and pursued him. He at once left the
footprints of his wife and ran back to his children. So after that the
little Coyotes had no mother. The Coyote then afterwards hunted food
alone for his children, and that is the reason why so many Coyotes have
to look out for their food alone.
