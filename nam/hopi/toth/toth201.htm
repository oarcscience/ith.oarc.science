They go to dwelling of Badger, who has hidden stick under his bed. Mice gather round bed of Badger, who groans as if he were going to die Mice while moving in circle, sing song about Badger and then chief tells him that nothing is matter with him. Chief then ascends ladder, followed by other Mice. Badger grabs stick and begins to strike at Mice, but hits none of them, and all escape. Some of the younger Mice being chased by Badger cannot find their way home and dig holes for themselves. This is Why they are living all over country. Hopi workers in field, if sick or hurt, are in some unseen way taken care of by Mice.</p>
