## 18. THE TWO WAR GODS AND THE TWO MAIDENS. <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_57.md)

A long time ago Pöokónghoya and his little brother Balö'ngahoya lived
north of the village at the shrine of the Achámali. One day they heard
that two beautiful maidens were watching some fields west of the village
of Hû'ckovi, of which the ruins may still be seen a few miles north-west
of Oraíbi. They concluded that they would go hunting and at the same
time visit those two maidens. When they arrived there the maidens
joyfully greeted them and they were joking and teasing each other. The
maidens believed that the two brothers had come with the intention to
marry them, and they said, in a half-jesting manner, to their suitors:
"We will cut off an arm from each one of you, and if you do not die you
may own us." The younger brother was at once willing, saying to his
elder brother: "They are beautiful; let us not be afraid of having our
arm cut off." The elder brother hesitated, saying, that that would hurt.
So the younger brother said, "I am willing," laid his right arm over the
edge of the mealing trough at which the maidens had been working, and
one of the maidens struck the arm with the upper mealing stone and cut
it off, the arm dropping into the trough or bin. His elder brother
hereupon laid his arm over the edge of the bin, which consisted of a
thin, sharp slab, and the other maiden also cut his arm off with her
mealing stone. Now the two brothers said: "If we recover, we shall come
after you. Hand us our arm, now." The maidens did so and the two
brothers left, each one carrying his severed arm, Arriving at their home
north of Oraíbi, they told their grandmother what had happened. "There,"
she said, "you have been in something again and have done some
mischief." "Yes," they said, "We met two beautiful

maidens and liked them very much, and so we allowed them to cut off our
arms. Very well, she said, "I am going to set you right again." So she
asked them to lay down north of the fireplace. She placed the two arms
by their sides, covered them up, whereupon she commenced to sing a song.
When she was through singing, she told them now to get up. They did so
and found their arms healed. The next day they proceeded to the house of
the maidens, who were surprised to see them fully recovered. The older
of the two sisters was the prettier one and Pöokónghoya wanted to choose
that one. His younger brother protested, saying: "Yesterday you were not
willing to have your arm cut off, as you were then afraid, and now you
want to have the first choice. I had my arm cut off first and I am going
to choose first," to which his elder brother finally consented. They
slept with the maidens that night and then left them and returned to
their home north of Oraíbi.
