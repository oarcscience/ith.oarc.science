## 54.--THE CHILDREN AND THE LIZARDS.

Man from Wálpi goes to attend dance at Shongópavi. He sees children
hunting lizards and shooting arrows at them. Proceeding, he hears voice
and sees little lizards sitting and making peculiar sounds. He watches
them running around and playing with each other. Man has lost so much
time he returns and relates that he has not seen dance, but has watched
children hunting and singing song, which is forever afterwards called
Mishóngnovi Song.
