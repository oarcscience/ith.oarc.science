## 13.--THE REVENGE OF THE KATCINAS.

Katcinas assemble in kiva in mountains and come to village in night.
They dance on plaza while people sleeping. Not knowing what or who
dancers are, people become angry and threaten to kill them. Katcinas run
away and jump from bluff into large crack. Katcina Uncle is in lead.
People set fire to them and burn them up, except Uncle, who is at
bottom. He returns home singing and sobbing. He finds Hehéa Katcina
hoeing, and tells what has happened. They go home to mountain, and when
chief hears he orders Katcinas to assemble. They make it hail for three
days. On fourth day they cause cloud to rise over mountains. Clouds
spread over sky and Hopi expect good rain. It thunders and lightens and
rains great hail stones. All crops are destroyed, and all people except
one man and one woman are killed. Clouds then disperse and Katcinas say
they are revenged.
