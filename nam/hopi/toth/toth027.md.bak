## 24. HOW PÖ'OKONG WON A BRIDE. <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_63.md)

Halíksai! In Oraíbi they were living. There were a great many people. At
Pik'áchvi lived a family who had a pretty maiden who persistently
refused all offers of marriage. Pöokónghoya and his brother
Balö'onghoya, who lived at Pöokongwawarzhpi with their grandmother,
Spider Woman, heard about this. They were thinking about it, and one
time said to their grandmother: "Our grandmother!" "What is it?" she
replied. "There is a maiden in the village," they said, "who refuses to
marry any one of the young men of the village. We are going to try,
too." "You poor ones," she said, "you are too small and you are
unsightly, she certainly will not want you." But they would not listen
and said, "But we are going to try it, anyway." "Very well," she said,
"you go and try it, but she will not want you because you are not
handsome."

So in the evening they took some squash seed and gathered some little
sticks and went to the village. West of the house where the maiden lived
a great many mice were living among the rocks. Here the Pö'okongs set a
number of stone traps, putting the squash seed into them. While they
were engaged in setting the traps towards evening, the maiden happened
to go by there and- saw them at work. "What are you doing here?" she
asked. "Yes," they said," we are setting traps here for the mice." "You
come to my house and set traps there, too," she said to them; "there are
a great many mice there.

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

So she took them over to her house where they set traps in different
parts of the house, also close to the mealing bin. They finally asked
whether they did not have a píki tray. The mother fetched one from
another room and they set that near the mealing tray, instead of a small
stone like in the other traps. "Now, to-morrow you must look after these
traps," they said to the maiden, and left. They at once went hunting and
killed an antelope. This they took to the house of the maiden during the
night and placed it under the píki tray, making it appear as if it had
been caught in that trap. When the maiden examined the traps the next
morning she found something large under the piki tray, and looking at it
she saw that it was an antelope. She at once called her father. "My
father," she said, "you go in there. Something large has been caught
there, and do not be slow about it." He was still sleeping, but got up
at once, went into the room, and saw that something large had been
caught there. "Thanks," he said. "Why this is an antelope; why, an
antelope has been caught here." Hereupon he took it out of the trap and
carried it into his kiva.

Here he skinned the antelope and cut it up into pieces. A part of the
meat his wife cooked as nö'ekwiwi, the rest he dried, and they were very
happy over it. In the evening the Pö'okongs took some more squash seed
and again repaired to the village, where they set traps as they had done
on the previous evening. While they were doing so the maiden was eating
of the antelope meat and then again went to the place where the
Pö'okongs were setting the traps. Here she met them. "Have you come
again?" she asked them." Yes, "they replied." When you are done here,"
she continued, "you come to our house again and set traps there, because
something large was trapped there this morning and we are very happy
over it."

They went with her to the house and there set traps everywhere again.
When they came to the tray the maiden said to them: "Here something
large was caught last night and of that we are eating now. We are very
happy over it. So you must set that again, too." While they were setting
this the father came in and asked them: "Are you setting traps here
again?" "Yes," they replied. "Very well," he said, "last night an
antelope was caught in this trap and of that we have been eating and we
are very happy over it. You have by that terminated something here
(referring to the persistent refusals of the maiden to enter into
marriage), so if to-morrow morning something is caught in this trap
again, you come here to-morrow evening and get our daughter."

In the night the Pö'okongs killed a deer, of which they owned

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

many, and carried it to the house of the maiden, where they placed it
under the píki tray trap. In the morning when the maiden arose she saw
something under the trap with big antlers. Running to her father she
called him, saying: "My father, come quickly. There is something large
in the trap." So he came and found a deer there. "Thanks," he said,
"this is a deer," and taking it out they carried it to the kiva where he
skinned it and cut up the meat. His wife again cooked a part of it,
while he hung all the rest up to dry. There was a great deal of meat
hanging outside of his house and they were very happy over it.

"To-night you wait for somebody here," he said to his daughter, Towards
evening they were eating of the meat that the mother had cooked, and in
the evening the maiden was grinding corn. In the house of the two
Pö'okongs the two brothers were getting ready to go to the house of the
maiden, but they began to quarrel about it. "I am going," Pö'okong said.
"No, indeed," his brother replied, "I'm going," and thus they were
contending with each other. "Now, why do you quarrel about this?" their
grandmother asked them. "Certainly Pö'okong must go because he is the
older one." Thus she spoke to them.

So in the evening Pö'okong proceeded to the house of the maiden, whom he
found grinding corn in an upper room. He entered and said: "I have come
because your father wished it that way." "Very well," she said, and went
to call her father. Her father went to Pö'okong and told him; "Yes, you
know I told you that you could come and fetch our daughter because you
have trapped this game for us, which we are eating and for which we are
glad." Hereupon the mother filled a tray with meal for her daughter, and
Pö'okong then led her away to his house in order to marry her. When they
arrived there the grandmother told them to come in, but she doubted
whether her grandchild had brought the maiden until she saw her enter.
She was then very happy and told them to sit down. She took the tray of
meal from the maiden and put it away into an inner room towards the
north. Coming out she placed before the maiden a small tray with a very
small quantity of hurúshuki, and invited the maiden to eat. The latter
took the entire quantity and placed it into her mouth. Spider Woman was
watching her and when she saw that she put all the hurúshuki into her
mouth, she said: "You must not do that, why that is 'very something,'
and you must just, take a very little of it." So the maiden replaced the
hurúshuki into the tray and then put a very small quantity into her
mouth. When she began to eat this it increased in her mouth so that her
mouth was

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

filled. She repeated this until she was satisfied and then there was
some of the hurúshuki left.

When the maiden had eater they soon retired for the night, the maiden
sleeping with the grandmother. Early the next morning the grandmother
and the maiden went out to throw an offering of sacred meal to the sun,
which they did close by the entrance of the kiva. Returning to the kiva
the grandmother, or Spider Woman, got some corn-ears, shelled them, and
then the maiden ground this corn for three days. Early on the fourth day
when the yellow dawn was rising, the grandmother went out and called out
to her neighbors that they should come in and assist in washing the
heads of the two. She then went in and brought out the maiden and told
her to be sitting close to the kiva entrance and then wait. Soon a great
many clouds came and rained upon the maiden, thus washing and bathing
her. "Thanks," the grandmother said, "that you have thus washed the
bride." Hereupon she took her into the kiva.

The maiden then again ground corn all day, and in the evening prepared
some chukúviki. Spider Woman got some meat from one of the inner rooms,
of which they then all ate. The next day this was repeated, and the
maiden then made some comíviki, and in this way she prepared food for
all of them day after day. But she felt unhappy because no one was
carding and spinning cotton and preparing a bridal costume for her, as
is always done for a bride. That way they were living there for some
time. The two Pö'okongs were constantly playing with their ball and
stick, also with feathered arrows, but no one was preparing a bridal
costume for the bride, about which she was very unhappy. But Spider
Woman would often go into an inner room and they would frequently hear
her say, "Thanks, thanks," to some one, but the maiden did not know to
whom she was talking, but there in that room the spiders were preparing
a bridal costume, first carding the cotton, then spinning it, placing it
onto a loom and then weaving it.

Finally Spider Woman said one day to the bride: "you prepare some píkami
now. Your parents are homesick after you and we shall then send you
home." The maiden prepared some píkami, and Spider Woman some nö'okwiwi,
and in the evening the maiden took Out the píkami from the oven, Spider
woman dipped out the nö'okwiwi, and all ate and then retired for the
night. In the morning Spider Woman prepared some yucca suds and with it
washed the heads of Pö'okong and his bride. She then entered an inner
room and brought forth a complete bridal costume, which she handed to
the maiden. She then again went into an inner room and brought

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

out a large quantity of meat which she handed to Pö'okong. He tied it
into a bundle. Hereupon Spider Woman dressed up the bride in the bridal
costume, the way it is done to-day, and then sent her on to her mother's
house. Pö'okong followed her, carrying on his back a large quantity of
meat.

Before they started Spider Woman instructed Pö'okong that when his wife
shall have taken him home now to her house and he should stay there, he
should not talk much, but in the evening he should sit on the floor with
his arms folded over his knees and he should be looking at his wrist
bands (by which she meant that he should simply be, sitting there
silently, as the Hopi are usually sitting on their floors and observe
silence). While they were going to the village the men who had gotten up
early were sitting on their housetops and saw them come. "Here somebody
is coming," they said. The two went to the house of the maiden's parents
where they were welcomed by the mother, who said, "Thanks that you have
come," and received from them what they were carrying.

The mother cooked all the meat which Pö'okong had brought, in a vessel,
and prepared a feast. After they had eaten they sat and conversed.
Pö'okong sat on the floor with his arms folded over his knees, but
instead of looking at his wrist band, he took it off, and holding it
before his eyes he looked through it. The people kept looking at him and
said among themselves: "So that is his custom, that is the way he does."
After they had all conversed a while they retired for the night. Early
in the morning Pö'okong went to his house to visit Spider Woman. When he
arrived there she asked him whether he had done as she had told him to
do about the wrist band. He replied: "When we were through eating and
they had taken away and all the things, and the men were conversing, I
took off my arm band and held it before my eyes and looked through it."
"You are naughty," his grandmother said, "I did not tell you to do that
way. If any one becomes a son-in-law he has to sit there quietly with
his hands folded over his knees close before his face so that his eyes
appear to be, looking at his arm band. You are ka hópi."

Hereupon he returned to the house of his wife again. After s(we time it
was planting time and the men began to plant. Pö'okong went to Spider
Woman and said: ''It is planting time and we are going to plant." "Very
well," she said, and gave him a small parcel of different kinds of corn
to plant. This he took over to the house where he saw his father-in-law
ready to go and plant. He had prepared a small sack full of corn, but
Pö'okong said to him: "Do not take that along, I have brought some
planting-corn with me." <span id="page_97">p. 97</span> Hereupon he
produced a very small parcel. "That is not enough," his father-in-law
said. "Yes, let us take this," Pö'okong said, ''this is a great deal."
"Very well," his father-in-law replied, "we shall take that," whereupon
he put away the sack of corn which he had gotten ready.

Hereupon they proceeded to the field of his father-in-law and commenced
to plant. Pö'okong always put one grain into the hole which he had made
with his planting stick, but when the man planted the first hill he put
in a great deal, the way the Hopi do to-day. When Pö'okong saw it he
said: "You must not do that way, but just put in one grain, that is
enough." The man immediately replaced the corn into the sack and put in
one grain of corn only, after that, and when they were done planting
they had not planted all the corn. It had kept increasing. The corn,
which they had planted, soon grew up and when it rained it became larger
and larger. One time it rained heavily and then much grass also came up.

Pö'okong went to visit Spider Woman again. "Have you planted?" she asked
him. "Yes," he said. "And when it rained a little," she kept on
inquiring, "did the grass come up?" "Yes," he said, "much grass and
weeds came up." She then told him that a son-in-law ought to help his
father-in-law to hoe his field, so he should return and go and do that.
He should take his hoe and form ant hills throughout the field
(referring to the small piles of sand and earth that are formed as one
is drawing a hoe through the ground; in other words, she meant that he
should diligently hoe the field). "Very well," he replied, and returned
to the house, where he asked for a hoe. They gave him one and he went to
the field. Here, however, he laid it down and at once began to hunt
ants. Finding a very large ant hill at the edge of the field he put the
ants together with the earth into his blanket and formed small ant hills
throughout the field, scattering ants in that way all through the
corn-field.

The next morning he again proceeded to his grandmother who asked him: "I
told you yesterday to go and hoe the field, what have you done about it?
How much did you hoe?" "Yes," he said, "you told me yesterday, so I went
to the field, laid down my hoe, and then hunted ant hills along the edge
of the field, and when I found a large one I placed it into my little
blanket and made little ant hills throughout the field, all day." "Now,
that is the way you have done again," she said. "You certainly are a
fool. I did not tell you that, I meant that when a man is hoeing and he
draws his hoe through the weeds from different sides, the earth and sand
is drawn together ill little piles, or hills. These are called ant
hills. That is what I

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

told you to do. You are a fool, a fool you are. You go back again, take
your hoe, and expose the moist ground by removing the dry surface in
cutting off the weeds (wíklolantanangwu)."

He returned to the house, and the next morning when they had their
morning meal he asked for a little grease of fat. They hunted some, tied
it up, and handed it to him. He took his hoe and fat, and went to the
field. Here he laid down his hoe and taking a little of the tallow which
he had brought with him, he scattered it all through the corn-field, an
act which in the Hopi language is expressed by the same word,
wíklolantanangwu. Hereupon he returned to the house without having hoed
any at all. Early the next morning he again visited Spider Woman. "Have
you come again?" she asked. "Yes," he replied. ''Now," she said, "you
remember what I told you to do yesterday. Have you done that way this
time at least?" "Yes," he said, "when we had eaten yesterday's morning
meal I asked my wife's mother for some tallow, which she gave me. I
wrapped it up and took it along to the field where I scattered it
throughout the field." "You are a fool, you are a fool, you are a great
fool. I never told you to do that. I told you to go and hoe the corn,
and you know if any man hoes and cuts off the weeds he stirs the dry
surface and the moist ground appears a little, and this is what I meant,
this is what I told you to do. But you go now, take your hoe and you go
and hoe the field."

When he returned to the house he found his father-in-law sitting and
meditating, evidently being very sad. He had been to the field several
times, and although his son-in-law had always gone to the field he did
not find any work done there. The grass was growing, the corn was
becoming tired (dry) and wilted, and he was thinking whether his
daughter should not send his son-in-law away. While he was thus
thinking, Pö'okong came to the house. When the latter saw his
father-in-law sitting there and evidently being very disappointed, he
asked him why he was so sad. "Yes," the man said, "I have been thinking
about our field. The grass and weeds are growing and the corn is getting
tired. There ought to be some corn ears forming by this time, but it is
getting dry." "So that is what you are thinking about," his son -in-law
said. "Now, you must not think about that any more. I shall go there
to-day and we shall finish hoeing that field to-day." Hereupon the two
went to the field.

Spider Woman had in the meanwhile asked the clouds to hoe the field of
her grandchild, and when the two commenced to hoe, a cloud was forming
over the San Francisco mountain. Soon many clouds

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

began to move towards the village. When they had hoed a little it
commenced to rain. They ran to a shelter where they sat and waited while
it was raining. The water soon began to run through the com-field in
little streamlets and covered up with sand and earth, the grass in the
field. When it stopped raining the two went through the field and saw
that the weed's had all been covered up by the floods. "Thanks," the old
man said, "that these have cleaned the field for us. We shall go home
now." So they went home, and that way were quickly through ridding their
field of the weeds.

They were now living happily in their home. By and by Pö'okong's wife
bore a little son who grew up and played with the children. His father
soon made him a bow and arrows with which he learned to shoot. He
sometimes shot the Oraíbi children and killed them. At this the Oraíbi
became very angry and said that Pö'okong should not live in the village,
but they should move away to their own house. So one time Pö'okong said,
"I am going to go back. I shall take my little son with me, on whose
account they are driving us away. But you shall stay here at your
father's and mother's," he said to his wife. So he took his little boy
on his back and returned to his home where he remained.
