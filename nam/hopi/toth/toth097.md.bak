## 94. THE RED EAGLE SONG. <span id="fr_178"></span>[1](toth098.htm#fn_176.md)

Halíksai! A long time ago, when people lived in all the seven Hopi
villages, and also at Sikyátki, Red Eagle and his wife lived on the
bluff running westward, north of Sikyátki. He had four children. He
lived on a small steep bluff called Kwákatpe. One time, early in the
morning, they had a dance and sang the following song:

Pu turzh hûvam, umuh totim!  
Now then come here, your youths!  
Kuywaman ayalalwaahahay.  
(To) behold send them!  
Ura conwayningwu  
Why pretty  
Kwakatpe palakwayo titooya  
At Kwakatpe (the) Red Eagle hatches children.  
Ura vungve tutunglainingwu.  
Why when grown up (they) are, ask for them.  
Haooo talti! talti!  
Ah, it has dawned! It has dawned!  
Haooo, talti! talti!  
Ah, it has dawned! It has dawned!  
Kwa--! (Here they all flew upward a little way and alighted again).

One of the men from Sikyátki heard them singing and saw them dance and
told his people about it. They soon afterwards went and captured the
small Eagles, and forever afterwards they used to get young eagles
there, the feathers of which they used for their prayer-offerings,
masks, etc.
