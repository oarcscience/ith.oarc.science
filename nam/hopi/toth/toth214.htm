<p>Racer Katcinas come to W&aacute;lpi from Siky&aacute;tki to race. W&aacute;lpi man cuts off hair knot of Katcina instead of small portion of side lock. Katcina is angry. He returns to Siky&aacute;tki and practices running. W&aacute;lpi come to have race at Siky&aacute;tki. Young man is still angry, and, taking knife, goes on bluff opposite Siky&aacute;tki. During dance he comes down and enters plaza. He races with clowns and catches them all, cutting off small portion of side locks. He detects on top of house sister of man who had cut his hair. He dashes to top of house, follows her and cuts off her head. Holding it by hair whorl, he swings head and dashes away. People follow him, but he escapes and returns to village by another trail. People of villages quarrel, but W&aacute;lpi withdraw. People of Siky&aacute;tki are very wicked, especially towards women. As they do not spare chief's wife, he determines to take revenge. He agrees with chief of W&aacute;lpi that when people are planting in valley, W&aacute;lpi shall come to village and destroy it. W&aacute;lpi have balls of pitch and when Siky&aacute;tki people are in fields they rush upon village and kill women and children. Then they set houses on fire destroying village. People planting see smoke and rush to village, but only have planting sticks. W&aacute;lpi are well armed and kill all people, including chief who instigated revenge.</p>
