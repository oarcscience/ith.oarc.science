## 92. THE SPARROW-HAWK AND THE GRASSHOPPERS. <span id="fr_176"></span>[2](#fn_174)

Halíksai! A long time ago a Sparrow-Hawk lived at Kâlâ'tipka, somewhat
northwest of Oraíbi. The Sparrow-Hawk had some children, so every day
the Sparrow-Hawk mother would go to hunt Some food for her children.
Close by were many grasshoppers.

These the Sparrow-Hawk would capture and take them to her nest for her
brood. At other times she would go and hunt some Prayer Beetles
(hohóyahtu). The mothers of the Beetles and of the Grasshoppers were
very unhappy. They saw that the young Sparrow-Hawks were growing fast
but their children were disappearing.

One morning the Grasshopper mother sneaked out of her house and looked
up and saw the Sparrow-Hawk mother sitting again near her nest. The
Sparrow-Hawk mother saw the Grasshopper and swooped down upon it and
caught it. The Grasshopper mother began to moan in the following manner:

Takakâlâtu Manakâlâtu  
(The) man Sparrow-Hawks, maiden Sparrow-Hawks,  
Itimui yukumanta  
My children have gotten.  
Oh! Oh!

The Sparrow-Hawk then released the Grasshopper mother and returned to
her nest. Soon some Hopi children came along and began to capture the
little Grasshoppers. The Grasshopper mother, seeing it, told them they
should not take them, but they should go and catch the young
Sparrow-Hawks and take them along. So they went to the house of the
Sparrow-Hawk and took the young Sparrow-Hawks and took them along to the
village.
