## 71.--THE COYOTE AND THE TURKEYS.

Coyote and Turkey are great friends and both have children. Coyote goes
to Turkey's house and admires figures on little turkey's feathers.
Turkey mother says she baked children and ate their meat, but did not
break any bones, which she put into tray and waved up and down, singing
song, and then threw bones outside and children got alive again
beautifully figured. In morning Coyote gets wood and makes oven very
hot. Then he throws all little Coyotes in and plasters oven up. In
evening he takes them out thoroughly baked, eats meat, but does not hurt
bones, which he gathers into basket. During night Turkey mother sends
her children away to San Francisco Mountains. She rolls up small
blankets and places them on floor to make them appear as sleeping. Then
she follows children. When sun comes out Coyote takes tray containing
children's bones, waves it up and down, singing song, and throws bones
away. Nothing comes alive and only bones are there. He is very angry and
runs very fast to friend's house. He jumps on beds and grabs at young
turkeys, but nobody is there. He hunts tracks of turkeys, who have
arrived at Little Colorado River. They cross it and little turkeys are
very tired and mother leaves them and runs ahead to San Francisco
Mountains.

She tells turkeys that Coyote is following them and two very strong
Turkey men run towards place where mother has left children. Coyote is
chasing little turkeys and is just about to take one when Turkey men
come, grab little Ones and run away with them on their backs. Coyote
says he is hungry and wants to cat them, but they do not listen to him.
He returns home hungry, but dies before he gets there.
