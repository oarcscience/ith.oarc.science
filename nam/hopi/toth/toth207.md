## 95.--THE RED EAGLE AND THE OWL.

Owl and Red Eagle are great friends. Eagle hunts during day and as Owl
cannot go out during day they do not hunt together. Eagle visits friend
and finds him sound asleep. He tries to waken him and finally succeeds
by pulling out few hairs. They go out to hunt, Eagle holding Owl so that
he shall not go to sleep again. Party of Oraíbi are following rabbit.
Eagle swoops down and carries it off. He returns for Owl and finds him
sleeping. He speaks to Owl, who does not hear. Oraíbi boys returning
from hunting shoot Owl through head and carry him home. Eagle is angry
and then lives in house all alone.
