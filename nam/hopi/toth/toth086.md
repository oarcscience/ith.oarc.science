## 83. THE BULL-SNAKE AND THE TÛ'CHVO <span id="fr_160"></span>[2](#fn_158) (WREN.md).

A long time ago some Oraíbi children were hunting some Tû'chvos. They
found a nest high up on a bluff, somewhere east of the village, but as
they could not get to it they returned to the village. By and by a
Bull-snake (Lölöoköngwuu), being in search of food had also discovered
the nest of the Tû'chvo. While coiled up at the foot of the bluff. the
Snake was discovered by the Bird. The latter, feeling secure at its high
place, began to joke the Snake, singing as follows:

Lölöoköngwuu, lölöoköngwuu!  
Bull-snake, Bull-snake!  
Tcöngmomoki, tcöngmomoki  
Dying of hunger, dying of hunger,  
Súun pi pâk wûptipkaa,  
Never you'll ascend here to my nest.

and then rushed back into its little hole. The Snake at once became
angry and said: "I am going to get up to you there. You are talking

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

to me that way now, but I am going to devour you." Whereupon he
commenced to hunt a place of ascent. Finally having found a place, tried
to climb up, but soon got tired and fell back. The little Bird seeing
it, triumphantly sang:

Súun pi pâk wûptípakaa.  
Never you'll ascend here to my nest.

This made the Snake still more angry and it tried to get up to the nest
again and succeeded in climbing up higher than before, but fell back
again. The little Bird again sang its little song of triumph. Thus the
Serpent made three unsuccessful efforts, but the fourth time it
succeeded in reaching the mouth of the opening in which the little
bird's nest was, and hooking its mouth over the rim, looked into the
hole and saw four young birds in the nest. He said to the Bird: "Now,
don't you run away, I am going to devour you," and then entered the
hole. The bird escaped, leaving its little ones in the nest. The Snake
coiled up in the nest and devoured the four little birds, whereupon it
remained in the nest four days. On the fourth day it left the place but
crawled up on the bluff where it coiled up. The old Bird kept flying and
running about in the neighborhood of the Snake, bewailing the loss of
its brood. The Snake then began to exert its charm on the poor Bird,
trying to cause it to come nearer. This the Snake did by strong
inhalations, and whenever the reptile inhaled the bird would be drawn
towards the snake, when it exhaled the bird would try to escape, but
would be drawn closer towards the Snake's mouth at the next
inhalation. <span id="fr_161"></span>[1](toth087.htm#fn_159.md) This game
the Snake carried on with its poor victim for quite a while, the poor
Bird being entirely under the charm of the reptile. Finally it was drawn
by a last strong inhalation on the part of the Snake close to the
latter's mouth and then the Snake devoured its victim.
