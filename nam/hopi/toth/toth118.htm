<p>In under-world people live in same manner as here. Chief of Bear clan angry at wife for often dancing in Butterfly dance. Chief sends P&ouml;'okong and his brother in search of another world. They find opening above, which P&ouml;'okong reaches by means of reed. Chief leaves wife dancing, and accompanied by P&ouml;'okong and his brother, Spider clan chief, and many people, they start and go out. Bear chief closes opening. It is dark, and chief sends eagle to hunt for light. Eagle finds it hot, but he makes it lighter. Buzzard then goes and is burned, but makes it lighter. Bear clan and Spider clan go in different directions. Spider clan travels north following chief. They come to cold country where North Old Man lives. They plant corn, etc. Chief has cult and altar of Blue Flutes. When corn grows he puts up altar, sings and flutes. When ears of corn develop cold destroys crop. This occurs four years in succession, and people start south after Bear people. Chief's wife bathes and collects scales rubbed from skin. Chief wraps them in reed receptacle, sings over them, covers them four times, and they become burros. They repeat performance and Spaniards come out. Chief tells them to put their things on burros and follow Bear clan and kill them. Castilians go south. Spider people go southeast, and stop at ten different places. They finally arrive where sun rises and Americans live. They stay three years and then follow Bear clan westward. At Ora&iacute;bi they join Bear clan, whose chief is Mach&iacute;to, and who have &Acirc;'ototo and &Aacute;holi Katcinas. Bear clan go south with &Acirc;'ototo Katcina and are joined by Young Coin Ear people who have &Aacute;holi Katcina. They stop ten times before arriving at Americans where sun rises. Here they stop four years. Land is scarce and they go west. Americans say if anybody bad they will come and cut their heads off. They finally arrive at Shong&oacute;pavi and settle down. People accuse chief Mach&iacute;to of greediness, and he leaves them with &Acirc;'ototo and &Aacute;holi. Hunters find them and want them to go back, but they refuse. Mach&iacute;to with stone makes land-mark between Ora&iacute;bi and Shong&oacute;pavi. Mach&iacute;to and two Katcinas go up Ora&iacute;bi mesa. Later Spider people arrive, and Mach&iacute;to asks about their wanderings. He says they may live there, but they are to watch sun for Soy&aacute;l ceremony and to make his kind of puhtavi. Among Spider clan is Lizard clan, who have Mara&uacute; cult, They are permitted to stay, but are to co-operate in Soy&aacute;l ceremony. Other clans that come are Rattle Snake, Badger, Butterfly, and Divided Spring. Divided Spring and Blue Flutes have corn contest, in which latter win.</p>
