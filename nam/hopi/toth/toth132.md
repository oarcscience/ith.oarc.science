## 19.--THE PÖOKÓNGHOYAS AND THE CANNIBAL MONSTER.

Large monster called Shíta comes to Oraíbi and devours people. Chief
asks Pöokónghoyas, who live near village, for assistance. They tell him
to make arrow for each of them. He brings them arrows and they go in
search of monster. They see it and it swallows them. They find
themselves on path into stomach, and see many people from different
parts of earth. Stomach is little world in itself. They go in search of
heart and shoot arrows into it. Monster dies, and they and people get
out through nose. People seek old homes, settling down temporarily at
different places, which accounts for many small ruins scattered
throughout country.
