## 43.--BIG HEAD AND GOAT HORN.

Big Head and Goat Horn are friends, but live so far apart in Oraíbi they
do Hot often visit each other. Once Goat Horn visits friend and, after
eating, he goes home, telling friend he must visit him sometime. Big
Head goes and stays night with friend. In morning he kills goat, cuts it
in two, and gives friend half. Big Head takes it with him, and that is
reason why Hopi when they kill goat cut it up.
