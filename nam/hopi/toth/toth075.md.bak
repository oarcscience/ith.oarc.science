## 72. THE CHÍRO AND THE COYOTE. <span id="fr_144"></span>[1](#fn_142.md)

In Oraíbi the people were living. At Íshmovala the Coyote lived. Away
over there at K'áhk'angwovâkaavi lived a great many Chíros, and they
were always dancing there. One time the Coyote was walking about east of
their village. The Chíros saw him as they were dancing. They were
singing as follows:

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

Ishawu, ishawu, höhöongyanikay cölmoki  
Coyote, Coyote, to dance is longing,  
Ishawu, oomii höngina,  
Coyote upward dances,  
Aatk'amii höngina,  
Downward dances,  
Machiwa, machiwa, chirorororo.  
Is called, is called chirorororo.

The Coyote was looking at them and wanted to dance along. "Very well,"
the Chíros said to him, whereupon each one of them gave him some
feathers; one some wing feathers, another some tail feathers, and so on.
They made for the Coyote wings and a tail, and put small feathers into
his body, whereupon the Coyote was very happy. "Thanks," he said, "that
you have made wings for me. I am going to dance with you now." Hereupon
they danced, again singing the same song. The Coyote danced with them.
Now they were flying upward somewhere, and arrived somewhere away high
up. Now they crowded around the Coyote and said: "Why, this is my wing;
why, this is my tail; why, these are my feathers;" some of them had
given him these things, and now they took everything away from him, and
alas! he began to descend. He arrived at the earth and died. The Chíros
laughed at him. "Thanks," they said, "that you have died, because you
very often do commit depredations on some one's property. That is why
you were going about again."
