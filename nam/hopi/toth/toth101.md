## 98. HOW THE BEETLES PRODUCED PAIN. <span id="fr_183"></span>[1](#fn_181.md)

In Oraíbi they were living, and at the Hohóyaw village lived the
Hohóyawtu (certain black Beetles). It was always hot and the wind was
blowing, and it did not rain. As these Beetles drink rain-water they
became very thirsty. Some became so thirsty that they died. So their
chief said one time: "Let us have a dance and perhaps if we dance it
will rain, because if it does not rain we shall all die!" "Very well, we
shall have a dance," they said, "and maybe it will rain then. and we
shall not die." So one evening they assembled to practice for the dance
and their chief made a little song for them. This they were practicing.
They practiced a while in the evening, and then they went to sleep.

The next day they were going to have their dance. Early in the morning
they got up and their chief made four nakwákwosis for them. He deposited
the nakwákwosis west of their little village, and spoke to the clouds in
the San Francisco mountains saying: "We are thirsty here, so you come
quickly this way and bring us some water that we may drink and not die."
So he returned to their village and they dressed up for the dance. They
painted their bodies black, and then they danced. They were in a hurry
because they were thirsty.

Their chief began to pray to the clouds in the San Francisco Mountains.
"Come this way quickly and bring us water." So they were formed in a
line now and one of them acted as leader. By this

time a cloud was forming in the mountains. They now sang the following
song:

Yoookwaa yoookwahayaha, Rain, rain.  
Ihi, aha, ihi.

As they were singing, the clouds came nearer and it began to rain and
thunder, and the water began to fall so that they could now drink. When
they had quenched their thirst they were very happy and ran about
because they were no longer thirsty.
