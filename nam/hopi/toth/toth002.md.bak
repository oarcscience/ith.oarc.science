# THE TRADITIONS OF THE HOPI.

## 1. ORIGIN MYTH. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

A very long time ago there was nothing but water. In the east Hurúing
Wuhti <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md), the deity of all hard
substances, lived in the ocean. Her house was a kiva like the kivas of
the Hopi of to-day. To the ladder leading into the kiva were usually
tied a skin of a gray fox and one of a yellow fox. Another Hurúing Wuhti
lived in the ocean in the west in a similar kiva, but to her ladder was
attached a turtle-shell rattle.

The Sun also existed at that time. Shortly before rising in the east the
Sun would dress up in the skin of the gray fox, whereupon it would begin
to dawn--the so-called white dawn of the Hopi. After a little while the
Sun would lay off the gray skin and put on the yellow fox skin,
whereupon the bright dawn of the morning--the so-called yellow dawn of
the Hopi--would appear. The Sun would then rise, that is, emerge from an
opening in the north end of the kiva in which Hurúing Wuhti lived. When
arriving in the west again, the sun would first announce his arrival by
fastening the rattle on the point of the ladder beam, whereupon he would
enter the kiva, pass through an opening in the north end of the kiva,
and continue his course eastward under the water and so on.

By and by these two deities caused some dry land to appear in the midst
of the water, the waters receding eastward and westward. The Sun passing
over this dry land constantly took notice of the fact, that no living
being of any kind could be seen anywhere, and mentioned this fact to the
two deities. So one time the Hurúing Wuhti of the west sent word through
the Sun to the Hurúing Wuhti in the east to come over to her as she
wanted to talk over this matter. The Hurúing Wuhti of the east complied
with this request and proceeded to the West over a rainbow. After
consulting each other on this point the two concluded that they would
create a little bird; so the

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

deity of the east made a wren of clay, and covered it up with a piece of
native cloth (möchápu). Hereupon they sang a song over it, and after a
little while the little bird showed signs of life. Uncovering it, a live
bird came forth, saying: "Úma hínok pas nui kitâ' náwakna?" (why do you
want me so quickly). "Yes," they said, "we want you to fly all over this
dry place and see whether you can find anything living." They thought
that as the Sun always passed over the middle of the earth, he might
have failed to notice any living beings that might exist in the north or
the south. So the little Wren, flew al over the earth, but upon its
return reported that no living being existed anywhere. Tradition says,
however, that by this time Spider Woman (Kóhk'ang Wuhti), lived
somewhere in the south-west at the edge of the water, also in a kiva,
but this the little bird had failed to notice.

Hereupon the deity of the west proceeded to make very many birds of
different kinds and form, placing them again under the same cover under
which the Wren had been brought, to life. They again sang a song over
them. Presently the birds began to move under the cover. The goddess
removed the cover and found under it all kinds of birds and fowls. "Why
do you want us so quickly?" the latter asked. "Yes, we want you to
inhabit this world." Hereupon the two deities taught every kind of bird
the sound that it should make, and then the birds scattered out in all
directions.

Hereupon the Hurúing Wuhti of the west made of clay all different kinds
of animals, and they were brought to life in the same manner as the
birds. They also asked the same question: "Why do you want us so
quickly?" "We want you to inhabit this earth," was the reply given them,
whereupon they were taught by their creators their different sounds or
languages, after which they proceeded forth to inhabit the different
parts of the earth. They now concluded that they would create man. The
deity of the east made of clay first a woman and then a man, who were
brought to life in exactly the same manner as the birds and animals
before them. They asked the same question, and were told that they
should live upon this earth and should understand everything. Hereupon
the Hurúing Wuhti of the east made two tablets of some hard substance,
whether stone or clay tradition does not say, and drew upon them with
the wooden stick certain characters, handing these tablets to the newly
created man and woman, who looked at them, but did not know what they
meant. So the deity of the east rubbed with the palms of her hands,
first the palms of the woman and then the palms of the man, by which
they were enlightened so that they understood the

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

writing on the tablets. Hereupon the deities taught these two a
language. <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md).After they had taught them
the language, the goddess of the east took them out of the kiva and led
them over a rainbow, to her home in the east. There they stayed four
days, after which Hurúing Wuhti told them to go now and select for
themselves a place and live there. The two proceeded forth saying that
they would travel around a while and wherever they would find a good
field they would remain. Finding a nice place at last, they built a
small, simple house, similar to the old houses of the Hopi. Soon the
Hurúing Wuhti of the west began to think of the matter again, and said
to herself : "This is not the way yet that it should be. We are not done
yet," and communicated her thoughts to the Hurúing Wuhti of the east. By
this time Spider Woman had heard about all this matter and she concluded
to anticipate the others and also create some beings. So she also made a
man and woman of clay, covered them up, sang over them, and brought to
life her handiwork. But these two proved to be Spaniards. She taught
them the Spanish language, also giving them similar tablets and
imparting knowledge to them by rubbing their hands in the same manner as
the woman of the East had done with the "White Men." Hereupon she
created two burros, which she gave to the Spanish man and woman. The
latter settled down close by. After this, Spider Woman continued to
create people in the same manner as she had created the Spaniards,
always a man and a woman, giving a different language to each pair. But
all at once she found that she had forgotten to create a woman for a
certain man, and that is the reason why now there are always some single
men.

She continued the creating of people in the same manner, giving new
languages as the pairs were formed. All at once she found that she had
failed to create a man for a certain woman, in other words, it was found
that there was one more woman than there were men. "Oh my!'' she said,
"How is this?" and then addressing the single woman she said: ''There is
a single man somewhere, who went away from here. You try to find him and
if he accepts you, you live with him. If not, both of you will have to
remain single. You do the best you can about that." The two finally
found each other, and the woman said, "Where shall we live?" The man
answered: "Why here, anywhere. We shall remain together." So he went to
work and built a house for them in which they lived. But it did not take

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

very long before they commenced to quarrel with each other. "I want to
live here alone," the woman said. "I can prepare food for myself."
''Yes, but who will get the wood for you? Who will work the fields?" the
man said. "We had better remain together." They made up with each other,
but peace did not last. They soon quarreled again, separated for a
while, came together again, separated again, and so on. Had these people
not lived in that way, all the other Hopi would now live in peace, but
others learned it from them, and that is the reason why there are so
many contentions between the men and their wives. These were the kind of
people that Spider Woman had created. The Hurúing Wuhti of the west
heard about this and commenced to meditate upon it. Soon she called the
goddess from the east to come over again, which the latter did. "I do
not want to live here alone," the deity of the west said, "I also want
some good people to live here." So she also created a number of other
people, but always a man and a wife. They were created in the same
manner as the deity of the east had created hers. They lived in the
west. Only wherever the people that Spider Woman had created came in
contact with these good people there was trouble. The people at that
time led a nomadic life, living mostly on game. Wherever they found
rabbits or antelope or deer they would kill the game and eat it. This
led to a good many contentions among the people. Finally the Woman of
the west said to her people: "You remain here; I am going to live, after
this, in the midst of the ocean in the west. When you want anything from
me, you pray to me there." Her people regretted this very much, but she
left them. The Hurúing Wuhti of the east did exactly the same thing, and
that is the reason why at the present day the places where these two
live are never seen.

Those Hopi who now want something from them deposit their prayer
offerings in the village. When, they say their wishes and prayers they
think of those two who live in the far distance, but of whom the Hopi
believe that they still remember them.

The Spanish were angry at Hurúing Wuhti and two of them took their guns
and proceeded to the abiding place of the deity. The Spaniards are very
skillful and they found a way to get there. When they arrived at the
house of Hurúing Wuhti the latter at once surmised what their intentions
were. "You have come to kill me," she said; "don't do that; lay down
your weapons and I shall show you something; I am not going to hurt
you." They laid down their arms, whereupon she went to the rear end of
the kiva and brought out a white lump like a stone and laid it before
the two men, asking

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

them to lift it up. One tried it, but could not lift it up, and what was
worse, his hands adhered to the stone. The other man tried to assist
him, but his hands also adhered to the stone, and thus they were both
prisoners. Hereupon Hurúing Wuhti took the two guns and said: "These do
not amount to anything," and then rubbed them between her hands to
powder. She then said to them: "You people ought to live in peace with
one another. You people of Spider Woman know many things, and the people
whom we have made also know many, but different, things. You ought not
to quarrel about these things, but learn from one another; if one has or
knows a good thing he should exchange it with others for other good
things that they know and have. If you will agree to this I shall
release you. They said they did, and that they would no more try to kill
the deity. Then the latter went to the rear end of the kiva where she
disappeared through an opening in the floor, from where she exerted a
secret influence upon the stone and thus released the two men, They
departed, but Hurúing Wuhti did not fully trust them, thinking that they
would return, but they never did.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[1:1](toth002.htm#fr_0.md) Told by Qöyáwaima
(Oraíbi), The events here related are supposed to have happened in the
lower world. The increasing of the various peoples and tribes, and the
constant contentions among them, finally led to the emigration from the
nether world through the sípapu into this world, the account of which is
related by variant traditions of the Hopi.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[1:2](toth002.htm#fr_1.md) The nearest literal
translation that can be given of this name, which appears so frequently
in Hopi mythology and ceremonies is Hard Being Woman, i. e., woman of
that which is hard, and the Hopi say she is the owner of such hard
objects as shells, corals, turquoise, beads, etc.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[3:1](toth002.htm#fr_2.md) Some Hopi say that these
two people were the ancestors of what are now called the White Man, and
the people say that they believe this language taught to these two
people was the language of the present White Man.
