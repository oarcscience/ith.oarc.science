## 60.--THE COYOTE AND THE BÁLÖLÖOKONG (WATER SERPENT).

Bálölöokong goes to Coyote's kiva, which he fills entirely, so that
Coyote has to go outside. Coyote is angry and makes large artificial
tail, which he fastens to his own. He visits Bálölöokong and tail fills
kiva. Bálölöokong has to go outside and when Coyote leaves sets
artificial tail on fire. Grain is set on fire and Coyote runs away and
finally reaches Little Colorado River, in which he is drowned, as in No.
59, but here he jumps into river because fire on tail reaches his
natural tail.
