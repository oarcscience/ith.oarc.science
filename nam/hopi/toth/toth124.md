## 11.--THE ORIGIN OF SOME MISHÓNGNOVI CLANS.

Bátki clan and Sand clan come from Palátkwapi. When travelling, Sand
clan spreads sand on ground and plants corn. Bátki clan causes it to
thunder and rain and crops grow in day. They find Bear, Parrot, and Crow
clans at Mishóngnovi, and are asked what they know about producing rain
crops. They show their power, and their leader is made chief of village.
Spring Toríva is very small, but Bátki-ñamu puts in it mud, grass, and
water from Little Colorado River and flow of water increases. Bátki is
admitted to Antelope and Blue Flute Fraternities of other clans Young
Corn-Ear clan comes from Pueblo and brings larger corn.
