## 57.--THE LOCUST THAT CAME TO LIFE WHILE BEING ROASTED.

Many locusts live in valleys around Oraíbi. Children capture many, which
women roast in pots with salt water. Voting men used to hunt jack
rabbits, and cotton-tail rabbits, but prefer to hunt locusts. While old
woman is stirring locusts in pot, one of them becomes alive, sings song
about locusts being meat instead of rabbits, while slowly crawling up
stirring stick. Woman replies to it and locust flies away with hissing
sound.
