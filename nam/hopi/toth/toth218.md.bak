## 107.--THE LAST FIGHT WITH THE NAVAHO.

While Oraíbi are practicing with bows and arrows at foot of mesa, news
is brought them that Navaho expedition is corning. Men hasten to village
where councils are held. Situation is discussed and warriors encouraged
during night, but many Hopi go to Navaho with presents. These are
weakened by blood-letting near ankle so that they may be recognized by
Navaho next day through walking slowly. Immediately before sunrise
Navaho ascend mesa and fill space north of village. Hopi warriors
protect their bodies with buck-skins and some have head-dresses of
societies. War rites are celebrated and warriors are decorated with
powdered war god vomisis stone. Leading Navaho rides up to Hopi, says
something and shoots arrow without hitting any one. Battle begins and
Hopi drive Navaho off mesa. Navaho who has lived in Oraíbi and speaks
Hopi calls out that Hopi had better not follow them, as many more Navaho
further east. But Hopi follow and while lines of warriors are facing
each other, Navaho woman on pony grabs lance from warrior and dashes
towards Hopi, followed by her people. They break line and divide Hopi
into two parties, which are surrounded. Navaho are mounted, but are
dressed only in loin cloths, while Hopi are wrapped with heavy
buckskins. Hopi break through, but are surrounded again, so that circles
become smaller and smaller. In afternoon small party of Hopi break
through and climb point of mesa. Three of them afterwards go down and
hide behind rocks, from which they kill number of Navaho who are fleeing
from party of Hopi, who then join others. All then ascend mesa, from
which they descend in another place and rest at spring. Navaho who had
at first pursued them male for village. Meanwhile different groups of
Hopi have succeeded in cutting way through assailants and run towards
village. Both sides have lost heavily. Hopi are followed by bands of
Navaho and others try to outflank them and reach village first. Six Hopi
hide in stone inclosure, who keep Navaho at distance until latter
procure firearms from comrades. Then five of Hopi are killed and sixth,
rushing through Navaho, jumps down steep place and hides under rock.
Brave Hopi warrior is hit several times by Navaho, but is protected by
buckskins, and they abandon pursuit of him. Hopi discover that among
Navaho are Hopi from Wálpi disguised as Navaho. Brave warrior addresses
them and they surround him. He is overpowered and killed and his heart

torn out. This is seen by man hidden under rock. Wálpi take victim on
horse to Wálpi and place him in small hut and throw stones upon him.
Navaho reach village and drive out sheep that have been assembled on
plaza behind barriers. Navaho women shell corn and load it on ponies.
Navaho then leave village, taking with them all sheep. They tie dead and
wounded on horses. Many wounded die while they are traveling and all are
buried at place sixty miles northeast of Oraíbi. After Navaho have left
village, straggling Hopi come in bearing wounded. Some have to be
carried into village and are placed in home of Coyote Clan. Here they
are attended by their "fathers," those who had carried them. On fourth
day survivors are taken to their homes.
