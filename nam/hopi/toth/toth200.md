## 87.--THE LITTLE GRAY MICE AND THE LITTLE BROWN MICE.

Little Gray Mice and Little Brown Mice are on very friendly terms. They
go to village at night and whenever one finds corn, it invites others to
come. They often visit and dance together and sing song about dawn. Gray
Mouse finds something good to eat and tells Brown Mice. They all come
from both places, but quarrel over food and there is great fight. Gray
Mice go to Brown Mice again and sing different song. Then they rush back
to their home. Brown Mice laugh and say others are afraid of them. Two
kinds of mice have not been on good terms since.
