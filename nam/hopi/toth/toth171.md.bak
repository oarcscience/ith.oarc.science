## 58.--THE COYOTE AND THE TURTLES.

Coyote hunts near place where turtles live in river, Turtle has little
baby, whom it leaves asleep when others go hunting food. Little turtle
awakes and, nobody being there, it cries and comes out of water. It
finds tracks and follows them for some distance, but cannot find any one
and cries bitterly. Coyote hears, hunts it up, and asks what it is
singing. Little turtle says he is not singing, he is crying. Coyote asks
why he is crying. Little turtle tells him, and he then threatens to eat
turtle if he does not sing again. Little turtle refuses and says if
Coyote eats him he will live in his body. Coyote then threatens to throw
him in water and little turtle asks him not to, as he would drown.
Coyote takes little turtle and slings him into water. Little turtle then
swims around and laughs at him. Coyote threatens to kill turtle's
mother. He meets turtles on way back to water and tries to seize one. It
draws its head, feet, and tail into shell and Coyote cannot hurt it. He
