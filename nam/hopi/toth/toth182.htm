<p>Coyote seeing Eagle stand on one foot, asks him why he does so. Eagle says he has cut one leg off. Coyote inquires how Eagle did it. Eagle tells him to lay leg across stone and strike on it with sharp stone and it will come off, adding that it does not hurt. Coyote does as told. Eagle lowers second leg, stretches out his wings, laughs at Coyote, and then flies away. Coyote limps away, crying.</p>
