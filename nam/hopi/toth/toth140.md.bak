## 27.--HOW THE YELLOW CORN-EAR MAIDEN BECAME A BULL-SNAKE.

Two maidens, friends, fall in love with young man, which leads to
quarrels between them. Yellow Corn-Ear maiden has supernatural powers.
They go to spring, and on return she suggests, after resting, they shall
play. Friend is to go down hill and Yellow Corn-Ear is to throw little
colored wheel she has at her and friend is to throw it back again.
Yellow Corn-Ear throws wheel, and when friend catches it, it is so heavy
it throws her down. When she rises she has turned to coyote. Yellow
Corn-Ear laughs at her and returns to village. Coyote maiden tries to
carry jug and cannot. She waits, crying, until evening, and then tries
to enter village, but dogs drive her away. She goes westward, and being
hungry, goes to temporary shelter of people in field and eats two
roasted corn-ears she finds. She again tries to enter village, but is
driven away She then goes westward again and arrives at hut of two
Qö'qöqlöm Katcinas, They are away hunting, and she remains there all
day. In evening they return, and one prepares to kill co , vote, when
other suggests they shall capture him alive and take him home to
grandmother, Spider Woman. On entering hut they hear coyote sob, and see
tears trickling down his eyes. They feed him, and loading meat, skins,
and coyote on their backs, they return to their home. Spider Woman is
pleased with present, but looking closely at it she says it is no
coyote, and inquires where they found it. She sends one for some tomóala
and other for juniper branches. When former returns she pours water into
vessel and puts hook from tomóala pods into neck and another into

back of coyote, which she places into water, covered with cloth. She
twists and turns by hooks and then pulls off skin of coyote. She finds
maiden in vessel, with clothes on and hair in curls. When juniper comes,
she bathes maiden and then gives her corn to grind. Spider Woman tells
maiden her mother is homesick after her. She then calls for Katcinas,
and tells them maiden's story. Maiden is dressed up, and after Spider
Woman has instructed her as to prayer-offerings for Katcinas and how to
get even with Yellow Corn-Ear, she goes to village with Katcinas.
Katcinas dance and sing. Parents hear they have brought daughter, but at
first refuse to believe news. They go for her, but mána remains with
Katcinas until father brings offerings. Maiden returns home, and next
day she goes to grind corn and sings about her adventures. Yellow
Corn-Ear maiden hears and visits her. She is treated cordially, and they
grind corn together as formerly. In evening they go to spring for water.
Yellow Corn-Ear maiden notices that friend uses peculiar little vessel
(given her by Spider Woman), and that water running into jug shows
different colors of rainbow. Friend drinks and says water tastes good.
She hands jug to Yellow Corn-Ear maiden, who drinks and turns into
bull-snake. Friend tells her to remain so, takes jug, and returns to
village, Bull-snake maiden later on goes to village and is killed by her
parents, who do not know her. Her soul goes to Skeleton House, and ever
since sorcerers occasionally leave their graves in form of bull-snakes.
