NOTE.

The traditions of the Hopi here presented were collected in the
vernacular and without an interpreter, by Mr. H. R. Voth, during the
last two years, in connection with other investigations among the Hopi
which he made for this institution. As in previous years, Mr. Stanley
McCormick has very generously provided the means for this additional
investigation, and it is a great pleasure to acknowledge the debt of
gratitude under which he has again placed this department.

GEORGE A. DORSEY,  
*Curator, Dept. of Anthropology.*

CHICAGO, January 1, 1905.
