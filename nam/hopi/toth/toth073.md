## 70. THE COYOTE AND THE RED EAGLE. <span id="fr_140"></span>[2](#fn_138.md)

In Mishóngnovi the people were living. North of the village at the bluff
Kwaná Vüvi lived the Red Eagle, and east of the village at
Where-Coyotes'-Heads-are-put-in (Ishqöttangat) <span
id="fr_141"></span>[3](#fn_139.md), lived the Coyote. He had children.
During the day it was very hot and he went to hunt something for them,
but did not kill anything. So he returned to his children, who were very
thirsty. They were living only a very short time. Now he went after
water for them to Toríva, but he had no jug, so he got water in his
mouth. When he arrived there he drank and drew out his mouth full of
water. With his mouth full of water he ran to his children and now he
arrived at Kwanávüvi, and there on the bluff sat the Red Eagle. He
danced on one leg and sang as follows:

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

Tipoki homponcholo  
Yep nu (Here I)  
Cholo, cholo, chololololo. <span
id="fr_142"></span>[1](toth074.htm#fn_140.md)

The Coyote laughed at the Red Eagle and spilled the water. Now he ran
back to the spring again, and again filled his mouth with water. Now he
ran again, and again arrived at the Red Eagle, who was still dancing,
and because he (the Coyote) laughed again, he again poured out the
water. Now the Coyote was angry. "Why do you dance here that way?" he
asked the Red Eagle. "Now let me go to the cedar timber and hunt some
pitch," and he ran very fast to the timber, and there a piñon-tree had a
great deal of pitch. He cut that off and carrying it, went home. Now he
again descended to Toríva and drank there, very much, because he was
very thirsty. When he had drank he filled his mouth and then pasted up
his mouth with the pitch. Now he again came to the Red Eagle, who was
again dancing. The Coyote again laughed, but his mouth was closed up
tightly and he did not spill the water. Now at last he ran to his
children very fast. When he arrived there they were sleeping nicely.
When he had taken off the pitch he poured the water into their mouths,
but they did not get awake. Why, they had died! Now because he was very
angry he wanted to kill the Red Eagle, and went to him, very angry. When
he arrived there the Red Eagle flew away. When he flew away he showed
him his leg and, behold! he had two legs. The Coyote jumped at him but
did not catch him, and thus he did not kill him.
