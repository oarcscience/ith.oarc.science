<p>W&aacute;lpi always have races and become strong. They propose to go to Ora&iacute;bi and race them, because they are not strong. Ora&iacute;bi youth visits friend in W&aacute;lpi and remains to see Katcina race. Friend tells him of intention of W&aacute;lpi. Early next morning youth returns to Ora&iacute;bi and tells what he has heard. Young men practice running for four days. On fifth day W&aacute;lpi come and dress up. Two Katcinas carry gifts and go to plaza. Ora&iacute;bi youths descend and race with Katcinas, Katcinas are soon tired and Ora&iacute;bi youths win all presents. Katcinas remove costumes and after receiving prayer meal go to west of village and again race. They are very tired and give up race. W&aacute;lpi return in despair. They agree not to go and race with Ora&iacute;bi again:</p>
