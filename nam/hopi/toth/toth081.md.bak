## 78. THE COYOTE AND THE GRASSHOPPERS. <span id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_149.md)

Alíksai! The people were living in Shongópavi. North of the village
(about three miles), was a bluff in which a Sparrow-hawk had his house
(nest). A short distance (about half a mile), north of Shongópavi was a
sand hill in which lived many Grasshoppers. These the Sparrow-hawk
relished very much and was constantly watching them. When he would see
the little Grasshoppers jumping about, he would swoop down on them and
carry them to his children, who would quickly devour them. There were
ten Grasshopper children, all of whom the Sparrow-hawk killed, one after
another. When they were all gone their parents mourned over the loss of
their children.

At this juncture a Coyote came along, saying to the Grasshopper mother:
"You are singing nicely. Sing to me, too." "No," she insisted, "I am not
singing, I am crying. This Sparrow-hawk killed all my children and I am
crying." But the Coyote would not listen, and said: "If you do not sing
to me I will devour you." Hereupon the Grasshopper mother repeated her
song:

Wala, wala, chochon nacomta,  
Tumaci kele nanakavoo  
Itimuy uuyinglawu  
Uy, uy, h- h- h- (with a rising inflection to represent sobbing).

The Coyote at once ran away singing the song of the Grasshopper.
Arriving at a rock he stumbled over it and fell down, losing by that the
song. He tried to sing it again but was just able to say the first
syllable, Wa, Wa. So he returned to the place where he had left the
Grasshopper woman, the latter, however, had also left the place
immediately after the departure of the Coyote, leaving in her place a
stone that resembled the form of the Grasshopper. Arriving at this stone
the Coyote said, "I have forgotten my song, sing it to me again," but
received no reply. "If you do not sing I shall devour you," he said,
''but still receiving no reply he grabbed the stone and broke his teeth.
The blood was running from his mouth. In this condition he ran about to
hunt food, but even when he found some he could not eat it as he had no
teeth, and so finally he perished with hunger.
