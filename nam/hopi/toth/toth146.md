## 33.--THE TWO YÁYAPONCHATU TRADE IN ORAÍBI.

Long ago Yáyaponchatu live near Oraíbi. They are like skeletons, white
with disheveled hair, and wear kilts of black and white striped cloth.
They understand fire. Oraíbi barter by putting things on pile in kiva
and sending round to different kivas to trade things off. Yáyaponchatu
send two to trade for native tobacco. They go to kiva and let down
bundles of broom grass. They make Hopi understand what they want, and
one of them gets tobacco. They go to another kiva, and other one trades
broom grass for tobacco. They are happy. and in village smoke tobacco.
