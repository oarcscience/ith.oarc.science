## 75. THE BADGER AND THE COYOTE. <span id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_145.md)

Halíksai! North-east of Wálpi at Oáktoika lived the Coyote. West of this
place at Shiwápba lived the Badger. They were friends. One time the
latter visited his friend, the Coyote. "Have you come?" the Coyote said.
"Yes," his friend replied. Hereupon they conversed until noon. "Now let
us have something to eat," the Coyote said, whereupon he went into a
room and got out some juniper berries. "This I am eating," he said to
his friend, and set it before him. "Now, eat this," he said. Hereupon
they ate. When that was eaten they conversed until towards evening, when
the Badger said he had to go home now. "Very well," the Coyote replied.
And after having invited his friend to visit him too, the Badger went
home. In the evening he went on a hunt and tracking a rabbit into a hole
he quickly dug him up and pulled him out. Having killed the rabbit he
took him home and put him away until the next morning.

Early in the morning he roasted the rabbit nicely and then waited for
his friend, who soon came. "Have you come?" the Badger said. "Yes," the
Coyote said. "Very well," the Badger said. So they conversed all
forenoon and at noon the Badger said: "Now, we are going to have
something to eat, too," whereupon he brought forth the roasted rabbit,
which looked very inviting. Cutting the rabbit up, the Badger invited
his friend to eat, whereupon they enjoyed their meal very much. When
they had eaten they again conversed with each other, and were very happy
talking about the good food that they had eaten. Towards evening the
Coyote said that he must go home now. "Very well," the Badger replied,
whereupon the

Coyote left, his friend having wished him a happy journey. After that
each one continued to live in his house.
