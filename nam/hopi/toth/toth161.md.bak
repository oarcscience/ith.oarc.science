## 48.--THE MAIDEN AND THE COYOTE.

Young men bring flowers to beautiful maiden of Oraíbi, but she refuses
them. Yellow Cloud chief of north hears about it, takes yellow bridal
outfit and offers it to maiden, but she refuses it. Then Blue Cloud
chief of west takes blue bridal outfit and offers it to maiden without
success. White Cloud chief of east, Black Cloud chief from above, and
Gray Cloud chief from below each tries his luck, but all fail. Rain
Deity in far south hears story. He paints and dresses up like Katcina
and proceeds to Oraíbi. Maiden is favorably impressed with him and
promises to ask her parents to give her to him in four days. Parents
offer no objection. Coyote Old Man, hearing maiden has accepted Rain
Deity, determines to win her. He travels south and captures Macaw, which
maiden accepts 'as present. During night he goes to house of Rain Deity
and steals his costume and ornaments. Next morning he dresses up and
paints like Rain Deity and proceeds to house of maiden, who, thinking it
is her lover, goes with Coyote Old Man to his house. Site soon discovers
mistake and is very unhappy. When Rain Deity awakes he misses costume.
He follows tracks to house of maiden and then to house of Coyote, where
he finds her. He returns home very angry. Young men of village hear and
go to kill Coyote. He manages to escape unhurt and from distance makes
defiant gesture at pursuers. Rain Deity afterwards strikes Coyote dead
with lightning. Maiden returns to her home, but leads life of lewdness.
