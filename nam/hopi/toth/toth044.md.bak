## 41. THE SHONGÓPAVI MAIDEN WHO TURNED INTO A DOG. <span id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_101.md)

Halíksai! In Shongópavi they were living, and a youth there was very
handsome, and all the maidens were coveting him. And one maiden was
young yet, had small hair whorls; she was dirty, and a bad looking
maiden. The maidens owned the chíro birds, and one of the maidens ground
coarse meal (hakwúshkwi) for them and put it into a tray, and when she
had put it in she lifted it up, and while she was singing she threw it
away. She sang: "Póta, póta, póta, Yóa íni, yóa íni," and then scattered
it to the birds. Now the chíros darted towards it and ate of it, and
when they had eaten they dispersed again, whistling, and were flying
around somewhere in the field. When it was evening they again assembled
at the mána's house. In the morning she again made hakwúshkwi for them
and fed them, and after that the mána always fed them.

Now that youth also made a tray. When he was done with it the maidens
assembled. He handed that tray to them, and when he had handed it to
them he said: "Now then, who opens this shall get me." Now one when she
had loosened it could not untie it. She handed it to another one, who
could not untie it, and thus one after the other tried to loosen and
untie it, and not one could open it. Now then when it came to that bad
looking maiden she also tried it. Now the old grandmother (Spider Woman)
informed her, ''When you will sing this you will open it." Thus she
informed her. So the maiden, while she was secretly singing, opened it.
When she had opened it, singing secretly, she opened it as her song
ended. When she had opened it all she owned the youth. Then those pretty
maidens were very sad and were angry.

Now the youth took her to his house, where the mother of the youth
bathed her entirely, whereupon she became a pretty maiden. She now
remained there as a bride. Then they made a bridal costume for her
whereupon she went home. When she went home the youth followed her. Now
she slept there in their house twice, and when she slept there the
second time she did not get up. At last when they were eating they would
still not get up, so the mother of the maiden went up to them and looked
at them and they were still sleeping, but that maiden had turned into
something; she had turned into a dog. Now the mother said to them, "Get
up, please." The dog got up at once and rushed out right away and jumped
down as a dog, and at once ran away somewhere, and is still going around
somewhere.
