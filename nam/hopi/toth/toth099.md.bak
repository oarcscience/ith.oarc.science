## 96. THE BEE AND THE ÁSYA. <span id="fr_180"></span>[1](#fn_178.md)

Halíksai! At Potátuk'aovi lived the Bee, and at Móngwupcovi lived the
Ásya (a species of bird). They were both women and both had children.
They were great friends with each other. The Ásya one time was walking
around in the peach orchard north of her house and was eating peaches,
which she relished very much. One time she was visiting her friend, the
Bee, and the latter fed her honey, of which she ate. After she was
through eating they conversed together all day. In the evening the Ásya
returned to her house, inviting her friend, however, to come and visit
her too in the morning, which the Bee promised to do. The next morning
the Bee went over to her

friend's house, but at that time the Bees had no wings. They walked like
the hohóyawuu, so that she did not get there very quickly.

The Ásya was living in an opening in a rock, which the Bee entered. The
Ásya gave her a seat and told her to be seated, and then fed her
peaches, which the Bee ate. "Do you like these peaches?" the Ásya asked.
"Yes," she said, "I always eat them. I like them very much; I live on
them." "But," the Bee said, "what do you think, shall I make some
medicine for the peaches? They are not good," because the peaches at
that time were not sweet as they are now; they were sour. "Very well,"
the Ásya replied, "make some medicine then, and I shall have something
that tastes well." Hereupon the Bee put some honey on the peaches, and
ever since the peaches are sweet and taste better. The Ásya was very
happy and said to the Bee, "I am glad, and I shall give you something
too, because you have made my peaches better."

Hereupon she pulled out some of her feathers, made some wings, and
attached them to the Bee, saying to her, "Now fly." But the Bee said, "I
do not know how it is done." "You just extend your front legs." The Bee
did so and moved them, whereupon she could fly, and flew away. Ever
since that time the bees can fly.
