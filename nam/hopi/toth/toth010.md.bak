## 7. THE SNAKE MYTH. <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md)

At Wû'hkok'ieqö the Píhk'ash and Kókop clans. The old men often wondered
where the Colorado River was flowing. So they built a box, put
provisions in, and a pole to push and guide the box with

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

when it got fast. They made also four báhos, put them and a young man
into the box, and sent the box off floating down the river.

After a while the box would go no farther, and so the young man got out.
He saw water everywhere. In the midst of it was a house. But how should
he get there? Presently Hurúing Wuhti came out there and called him four
times. Then he consented to go to her. She rolled a corn-meal ball
across the water, which made a road. On this he went to her house. In
the evening Hurúing Wuhti sent him into a side room saying that
something was coming. It was the Sun. He was sitting on a disk attached
to a pole like a spindle and made a great noise. He was dressed like
some Katcinas (Powámu and others) and nicely painted up with fine
sik'áhpik'i. Her house is open below. He came in and assorted the báhos
that had been offered to him on his course around the earth. Those
offered by the bad people were thrown away; those from the good people
were put in a row. He then came into Hurúing Wuhti's house and bathed
his body. After his bath he ate some hurúshik'i, öongáwi, etc. When he
was through eating he put on his paint and clothes again, went down into
his house and under the earth to the east and west on his course again.
During this course eastward the people below the earth see him there. In
the east he goes down in his house. Hence, the báhos offered to the Sun
are carried eastward to the Sun Shrines of the Sun clan (tawá kihus).
There east lived also "Flutes" (Lâ'lentû), who are always playing and
then the sun rises. For that reason at the Flute ceremony the gray fox
skin (lâ'tayo nátsi) is put up at the white dawn (qöyángwunuptu), then
the yellow fox skin (sikáhtayo nátsi) at the yellow dawn
(sik'ángwunuptu).

Then the Sun there lays off his clothes again, bathes his body, is fed
by the Sun clan (Tawá-ñamu), arrays himself again, mounts a bluff
(chochókpi), and again proceeds on his course gathering the báhos, etc.,
that are offered to him as he sweeps westward.
