## 45. HOW THE CHILDREN OF PIVÁNHONK'API OBTAINED PERMISSION TO CATCH BIRDS. <span id="fr_106"></span>[1](#fn_104)

Halíksai! At Hû'kovi they were living, and at Pivánhonk'api they were
also living. At both places there were a great many children, and they
always went down to Mumúshva (a spring named after a certain herb and
grass that grows in the spring), where they were setting bird traps.
They were often at enmity with one another on account of the birds. One
morning they again went to trap birds. They again became very angry at
one another on account of the trapping, and the Hû'kovi children said to
the children of Pivánhonk'api that they should not trap birds there. But
they said if they would give them something they could trap birds there.
So the children from Pivánhonk'api ran back to the village and got such
things as kûtû'ki, píki, and different other articles of food, and gave
them to the children of Hû'kovi, so that the latter carried home a great
deal of food which they had purchased for the permission given to the
Pivánhonkapi children to catch birds there, and after that the children
from both villages were always catching birds there, and maybe they are
catching birds there still.
