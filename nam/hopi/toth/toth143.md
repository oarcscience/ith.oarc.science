## 30.--SKELETON WOMAN AND THE HUNTER.

Poor youth does not go with young men to hunt when snow on ground. Older
men in kiva ask why he has not gone on hunt. He says he has no
moccasins. They make him pair Of moccasins and some leggings, and give
him old blanket, also bow and arrows and some throwing sticks. They then
explain difference between rabbit tracks and those of other animals. He
leaves village and finds rabbit tracks, which he follows for long
distance. Comes upon tired jack-rabbit, which he kills. On returning it

leaving him to attend to fire. He sees opening of kiva closed with
threads stretched in every direction. Woman comes again dancing and
singing, and is skeleton. As she turns around youth jumps up, runs up
ladder and cuts strings closing opening, and runs away. He again sees
light, and finds another kiva where dancing is going on. He enters and
asks dancers to hide him. They are crickets. They rub clay over his body
and he dances along. Skeleton Woman comes and asks for her husband. They
pretend not to hear her, but she enters and examines dancers. Youth
rushes out and runs towards village pursued by Skeleton Woman, who fails
to overtake him.
