## 32. MÁSAUWUU AND THE HÁNO HUNTERS. <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](toth036.htm#fn_82.md)

In Háno the people were living. In the winter it snowed very much and
there was much snow, and the Hano went hunting. North of the village
they were hunting towards the Sun shrine, and they were hunting rabbits
there in the snow. There were a great many rabbits. When they had killed
a great many they went home, but still hunting. North of Wálpi, at
Pûhúvavi there lived the Másauwuu. In order to hunt he lived there. He
was also hunting in the night. During the day he was sleeping all day.
There were a great many rabbits. When he was still sleeping the Háno
arrived. The Másauwuu was living at Big Rock (Wûwû'koa). When the Háno
came a cotton-tail was running and they followed him. "Havá! havá!" they
said, and pursued him. The rabbit jumped down just where the Másauwuu
was sleeping. The Háno also jumped down, making a great deal of noise.
The Másauwuu had a great deal of game under the rock.

Now the Másauwuu jumped up quickly and ran. He ran against a point of
the rock, then he ran in a different direction and again ran against the
rock. He had thus perforated his head. In that way he again ran against
the rock from place to place. When his head was full of holes the blood
was streaming down. A long time ago he used to have a white head, but on
account of the Háno now he always has a bloody head. Now they
distributed his game. From there they proceeded, tired. Had the Háno not
been going around there the Másauwuu would still have a white head.
