## 63.--THE COYOTE, THE BAT, AND THE HUMMING-BIRD.

Coyote, Bat, and Humming-bird are friends. Bat and bird visit Coyote,
who always has plenty of meat, which they enjoy. Rat thinks he will
invite his two friends, but is worried as to what he will give them to
eat. He goes in evening to Oraíbi, thinking some one may have forgotten
to take in meat that is drying, but finds none. He returns home
discouraged, but goes again and finds open window, through which he gets
into house, and carries home piece of tallow. He afterwards gets more
tallow and some meat and some salt. He determines if his friends ask
where he got food to say from Badger. In morning he invites bird and
Coyote to visit him. They go and at noon Bat prepares meal. His friends
enjoy food and ask him where he got it. He says Badger gave him it. They
say nothing, but on way home talk matters over and agree that Bat is
deceiving them. Bird visits Coyote in evening. They talk about food and
agree that Bat must have stolen it in Oraíbi. They conclude they will
song-tie him and start to make song. During night Coyote finishes song
and in morning he goes to bird's house and. sings song. They practice it
until they both know it, Bird invites Bat in evening and fetches Coyote.
Bird proposes to have song and they all. stand in line. Bird begins
song, Coyote chimes in and Bat sings best he can, but soon finds out
that joke is being played on him. He stops singing, tells them they have
song-tied him and that it ends their friendship. They disperse and never
become friends again.
