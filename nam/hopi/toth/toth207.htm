<p>Owl and Red Eagle are great friends. Eagle hunts during day and as Owl cannot go out during day they do not hunt together. Eagle visits friend and finds him sound asleep. He tries to waken him and finally succeeds by pulling out few hairs. They go out to hunt, Eagle holding Owl so that he shall not go to sleep again. Party of Ora&iacute;bi are following rabbit. Eagle swoops down and carries it off. He returns for Owl and finds him sleeping. He speaks to Owl, who does not hear. Ora&iacute;bi boys returning from hunting shoot Owl through head and carry him home. Eagle is angry and then lives in house all alone.</p>
