## 66.--THE ÁAHTU AND THE COYOTE.

Áahtu are playing in cedar timber and singing. When through with song
they throw their eyes on tree and on again singing song eyes return to
their sockets. Coyote comes and asks what they are doing. They tell him
that when eyes are not clear and they are thrown away in that manner
they become clear again. Coyote says one of his eyes is not clear and he
will join them. He throws his eyes on tree with others at last word of
song. They sing again and all eyes except those of Coyote return. Little
birds all laugh at him and say eyes will not return as he is bad. Coyote
is angry and leaves them. He can find nothing to eat and soon dies.
