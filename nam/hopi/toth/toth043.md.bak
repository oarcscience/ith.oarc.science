## 40. HOW HIYÓNATITIWA DEFEATED THE PLAN OF HIS ENEMIES. <span id="fr_102"></span>[1](#fn_100.md)

Halíksai! In Oraíbi they were living. At the place where now Hóngsi and
Nákwsu live, lived a maiden who refused all offers of marriage. The
young men of the village would frequently go there

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

and try to win her affections, but without success. At Achámali (now a
shrine a few hundred yards north of the village) lived a youth by the
name of Hiyónatitiwa, with his grandmother. They were very poor. The
young man always went around with a patched blanket, and his grandmother
also did so. One time he said to the latter: "My grandmother!" "Ha!" she
said. "I am going to go south to that maiden there and see whether she
will not marry me." "O my!" the grandmother said, "you are so poor, she
will certainly not want you, and you are thinking of it. But at least go
there and try it," she said to him.

So one time he came to the village. On the Snake and Flute and other
kivas and on some of the houses the young men were still sitting, as it
was twilight. As they saw the youth come they said: "Aha, somebody is
coming here." So he stood and waited. They went to their supper and then
returned, taking their previous places again. But the young man, not
wanting to wait any longer, boldly passed between them to the house of
the maiden. There was an open window in the upper story of the house,
and to this the youth went up. The young people who saw him smiled. The
maiden was grinding corn, but occasionally stopped. The young people
watched the proceedings, and as they heard that the maiden occasionally
stopped grinding, they concluded and said that the young man must be
welcome, and she must be talking with him sometimes, because she stops
grinding corn occasionally.

The young man talked to the maiden and asked her to marry him. She said
that if her father and mother were willing, she would marry him. "Very
well," he said, he would return the next evening, and if they were
willing he would fetch her. Hereupon he returned home. The young men of
the village were very unhappy. The youth said to his grandmother that
to-morrow he would fetch the maiden. She refused to believe it.
"Certainly I am going to fetch her," he said. And so the day passed and
evening came. When it was dark he again proceeded to the house of the
maiden. The young men of the village were again sitting on the roofs of
the kivas and houses watching him. He went up to the house, and after a
little while brought with him the mána, taking her to his house. The
young men said to him as they passed along: "So you are fetching her.
What do you want with her? But, of course, you are going to dress her up
in patched blankets."

So he brought her to the house of his grandmother and went in. She took
charge of the maiden and the latter remained there. The next three days
she ground corn, and on the morning of the fourth day the grandmother
washed their heads, but there was nobody there

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

to participate. There was nobody there to make a bridal costume, for
which the maiden was now sorry. Hereupon the bride remained there and
prepared the food for them, but no one prepared a bridal costume for
her. When she had remained there about the time that brides usually
remain at their husband's house before they go home to their mother's
house, the old grandmother said: "Now, you have been here about that
long, we shall see whether we can find something for you."

That day the young man went hunting and brought home a great deal of
meat. They prepared some nö'okwiwi, some píkami, etc. Of this they ate
in the evening. Early the next morning the grandmother again washed the
head of the bride, and hereupon she went into a room on the north side
and was hunting around there, knocking things about, but found nothing.
Going into another room on the west side she did the same, but had
nothing when she came out. She repeated this in a room on the south
side, but when she came out of a room on the east side she brought with
her a complete bridal costume--two white robes, a pair of moccasins, a
white, knotted, fringed belt and a reed receptacle. She dressed up the
bride, sprinkled a road of corn-meal for her, and sent her home to her
parents. The people were again sitting on their housetops and kiva
roofs, and, behold! there the young bride came home, dressed as brides
usually are dressed. When she came to her mother's house her mother was
very happy.

Her husband went on a hunt the next day and brought back with him a
mountain sheep. This he handed to his wife's parents, who were very
happy over it. The inhabitants of the Snake and Náshabe kivas were very
angry at this young man and were planning how they could kill him. They
decided to make a raid on the Navaho. But the father of the young wife
was also one of the inhabitants of the Snake kiva, and so he found out
how matters stood. He told his son-in-law about it, and the latter
informed his grandmother. She said that the next morning he should send
his wife's little sister to the Snake kiva to call his father-in-law for
breakfast. Hereupon the young man returned.

In the morning the maiden went to the Snake kiva, called her father for
the morning meal, and added that in four days there would be war,
whereupon she ran back. The people in the kiva were surprised, but
laughed. The next day she repeated this, saying that in three days there
would be war, and soon. In the evening of the second day the father and
his son-in-law went over to the old woman at Achámali, and said: "It is
drawing nearer." "Yes," she said, "when

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

they will have a race to-morrow you must not race with them, but you
both come here first and start from here." Whereupon the two returned
home. The next morning the little maiden repeated the same words. The
men now began to feel uneasy, saving that that maiden certainly did not
say that for nothing. Something must be about to happen.

On the. morning of the third day she repeated the same words, saying:
"To-morrow there will be war." That day the men made bows and arrows all
day. On the morning of the fourth day the maiden again said: "Let us go
and eat, but to-day there will be war," whereupon she ran home. It had
been noised abroad that some Navaho were approaching the village and
were attacking some men in the fields, The men who were not killed ran
towards the village and shouted. The men of the village at once got
ready and descended the village to meet the Navaho raiders. Hiyónatitiwa
and his father-in-law each got two quivers full of arrows and a bow, and
then ran over to Achámali to the old woman's house. "Have you come"' she
said. "Yes," they replied. Hereupon she went to the room on the north
and called in: "Come out here, your grandchildren have come here." At
once somebody came. It was the Puma. She then called into the room on
the west side: "Your grandchildren have come, come out here," and a Bear
came out. She repeated this, calling into the room on the south side,
and a Wildcat came out. Repeating this same act on the east side, a Wolf
came out of the room.

While this was going on at Achámali, the Hopi had met the Navaho, and
the latter were constantly asking where Hiyónatitiwa was. "He is in the
village yet," the Hopi replied. "Go and get him, he is slow," the Navaho
said. By this time the young man and his father-in-law, accompanied by
the four animals , descended the mesa. The animals at once rushed upon
the Navaho, who were nearly all killed, and also the Hopi that had
planned this raid in order to get Hiyánatitiwa out of the way, and then
steal his wife. When those who remained alive returned to the village
there was a great deal of mourning there. "Somebody has certainly
brought this about that some of our people have now been killed also,"
they said. And this way it was prevented that some one should take away
the Young man's wife, and he forever afterwards lived with her.
