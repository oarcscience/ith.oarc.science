<p>Navaho living east of Ora&iacute;bi steal Hopi boy. They make him work and give him little to eat, so that he becomes emaciated. Navaho have great gathering and leave boy behind. Hawk pities him and carries him on his back to bluff. Hawk then swoops down on Navaho camp and grabs little boy of wealthy Navaho, tears clothes from him, and then drops him. He takes costume to little boy and then grabs another Navaho boy and takes his moccasins. Navaho are much frightened and disperse in all directions. Hawk gets boy firewood and fire and some rabbit meat, which boy roasts and eats. He stays four days in Hawk's house Then Hawk takes him on his back, and, after circling round Navaho camp number of times, flies with child to village of Ora&iacute;bi.</p>
