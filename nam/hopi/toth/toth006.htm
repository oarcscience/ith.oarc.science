<p>Away down the s&iacute;papu in the under-world the people lived in the same manner as they do here. The wife of the chief of the Bear clan often danced in the Butterfly dance (Pol&iacute;htikivee), at which the chief got angry. The Spider clan had also a chief. The Bear chief sent the P&ouml;'okong to limit for them another life (k&aacute;tci) or world and see whether they could not get out. He was so angry at his wife's participating in the dance, fearing that she would be led astray, he wanted to go away and leave her.</p>  
<p>P&ouml;'okong and his younger brother Bal&ouml;'ongahoya went in search of another world, and when they returned, reported that there was an opening right above them. P&ouml;'okong had reached it by means of a reed on which he had spit and thus made it strong. The chief said, as they were still dancing (the Butterfly dance) they would move in four days. After four days they were still dancing, and the chief said to some one that he would not tell his wife anything, but try to find another wife. So he left, being accompanied by P&ouml;'okong and, Bal&ouml;'ongahoya, the P&ouml;lis still dancing wildly. They started and went out, P&ouml;'okong first, then Bal&ouml;'ongahoya, then the Bear clan chief, who was followed by the Spider clan chief. Then the Bear clan people, the Spider clan people, and after them many other people came out. When many were out the Bear chief closed the opening. When they were out the chief said, ''Well, what now?" They were in the dark yet, the entrance, however, being closed. The chief sent the Eagle who flew around hunting an opening or light. H returned, and the chief asked: ''Ta&aacute; um hin naw&oacute;ti?" "Well, I found an opening and made it more light, but it is very hot high up yet. Send another one." So the chief sent the Buzzard (Wic&oacute;ko). The latter ascended higher but got burned (hence he has no feathers on his head and wings), but he made it lighter, When he returned that chief said: "Thank</p>

<p>you. Well, now what? Now it is somewhat better. The sky has been opened somewhat more and it is much lighter." The question arose: Which way? The Bear clan spoke for the South, the Spider clan for the north, and the latter talking more and getting the greater crowd, the Spider clan went northward.</p>
