<p>Young man thinks he will try to marry maiden who has refused all young men of village. He sees her grinding corn, and tells her to stop. They converse, and when she finds out who he is, she consents if mother willing. Parents say he will be welcome. Next morning young man prepares ten bunches of corn ears and proceeds to village. Maiden asks him to come in and they sit on opposite sides of fireplace. Young man wears mask of Ball-Head. He gives her corn of which she eats and takes to parents.

<p>tray to grandmother, and after evening meal they retire, m&aacute;na sleeping with grandmother. In morning, after making prayer-offerings to dawn and sun, m&aacute;na shells corn. Young man calls chickens, who eat corn. He tells chickens to sit on banquette and then sings to them, accompanying song with drum. Chickens sway bodies from side to side to time of singing, and so grind corn in bodies. They then vomit meal into tray and leave kiva. Maiden thus saved trouble to grind meal. Young man hunts, and they prepare much food. Grandmother calls neighbors to come and eat. They come, each bringing part of bridal costume. In morning grandmother washes m&aacute;na's head with yucca suds. Afterwards she dresses m&aacute;na in bridal costume. Grandmother sprinkles road of meal, and children go to bride's house, where they are welcomed by her mother. Young people live in village, which prospers, as young man is Katcina. Wife goes astray and husband leaves village. People then become poor.</p>
