<p>Large monster called Sh&iacute;ta comes to Ora&iacute;bi and devours people. Chief asks P&ouml;ok&oacute;nghoyas, who live near village, for assistance. They tell him to make arrow for each of them. He brings them arrows and they go in search of monster. They see it and it swallows them. They find themselves on path into stomach, and see many people from different parts of earth. Stomach is little world in itself. They go in search of heart and shoot arrows into it. Monster dies, and they and people get out through nose. People seek old homes, settling down temporarily at different places, which accounts for many small ruins scattered throughout country.</p>
