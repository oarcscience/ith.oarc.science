## 56.--THE TOAD AND THE SNOW KATCÍNAS.

Son of Toad Woman goes to village to listen to Snow Katcínas practice
their singing. He wears robe of wildcat skin, as is customary among
young men. On eighth day Toad Woman washes his head with suds. When suit
rises, he puts on robe and cap of skin and goes to village. He paints
his face. Children laugh at his funny cap. Nobody gives him food, but
old man tells children to take him to ant hill. When he has eaten many
ants, he goes back to plaza and attends dance all day, enjoying himself.
As he leaves village in evening, children follow, having red piki. He
asks for some. They give him very little, which he takes to his mother,
and she is happy.
