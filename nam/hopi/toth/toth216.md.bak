## 104.--THE DESTRUCTION OF AOÁTOVI.

Maidens are afraid of son of village chief at Aoátovi and refuse to
marry him. He gets up great hunt and many rabbits are killed. Hawk kills
rabbit for chief's son, so chief has much game to carry home. After
eating, father smokes on game. Son tells father he is unhappy and
suggests they shall do something to people. In morning village chief
goes to Háno, tells chief that maidens refuse to marry his son, and asks
him to come and fetch people. He tells him to bring Spanish pepper. Háno
chief informs people of Sitchomovi and Wálpi, and says they are to get
ready for expedition next night. Next evening people of three villages
go to Aoátovi. Great storm is raging and they ascend mesa. Men are in
kivas eating evening meal. Enemies draw ladders from kivas, so that men
cannot come out. They gather women and children, and, while some drive
them off, others throw firebrands into kivas and destroy men. Captives
are taken to villages and distributed.
