## 97. THE GRASSHOPPERS AND THE ORAÍBI MAIDEN. <span id="fr_181"></span>[1](#fn_179.md)

At our village the people were living. At the place where now
Shókhungioma and his wife, Síngösi, are living somebody lived and had a
daughter whose name was Awát Mcána. The father had a field west of the
village in the valley and often watched that field. He became tired of
watching the field alone, and so one time he said to his daughter she
should relieve him once; he would go down early and then after breakfast
she should come down and take his place. So after breakfast she went
down and took her father's place and the latter returned to the village.
She was sitting in the kísi (a temporary booth or bower to give shade);
all at once she heard some singing at a distance in the hollow, but she
did not go there. In the evening she went home. The father thanked her
that she had assisted him. "Yes," she said, "to-morrow I am going down
again when it is very early." The father asked her whether their corn
had already roasting ears. She said yes, she had gone through the corn
and had found that the roasting ears were beginning to come out already.

Her father had seen what the girl had believed to be singing children.
They were Grasshoppers. So in the morning she went to

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

the field early and stayed there during the day. When the sun was well
up it became warm and then she heard the singing again. She thought she
would see what it was, and going in a southerly direction she cam; upon
a little wash, and away down in the wash in the shadow of the bank she
saw many little beings engaged in a dance and in singing. When she saw
them she stopped short, but the Grasshoppers also noticed her and said:
"Somebody is standing there"; so they stopped their dancing. The maiden
said, "Go on, dance some more," but they hesitated for a little while.
She urged them to perform another dance, but they refused to do it. She
finally said, "If you dance for me once more you can have one division
of our corn-field and eat the corn." They then were willing to dance,
bending. their front legs like arms, and swinging them lively back and
forth, to which they sang the following song: <span
id="fr_182"></span>[1](#fn_180.md)

Yayaaaaa shaolololo,  
Yayaaaaa shaolololo,  
Hotingawi,  
Yayaaaa shaolololo,  
Yayaaaa shaolololo,  
Hotingawi.  
Halatoni halatoni,  
Halatoni halatoni,  
Yamoshkiki yamoshkiki,  
Ruk, ruk, ruk, ruk.

When they were through they said: "Now, let us go," and, then they began
to emerge from the wash and it was found that they had wings, so they
flew to the corn-field and began to devour the corn. The maiden ran
after them, and when she saw that they were eating away the corn beyond
the limit she had allowed them, she told them they should stop as her
father would be angry. When she saw that they would not stop she began
to cry and took her blanket and began to beat them. When she found that
that would not do any good she left them and ran to the village,
arriving there nearly at noon, all in perspiration and nearly out of
breath. Her father was just spinning cotton for a ceremonial robe
(atö'ö), for her. "Why did you come home?" her father asked. "Yes," she
said, "something is eating our corn," and then she told him all about
it. "Ishohí!" he exclaimed, "they are certainly going to eat all of the
corn." He at once laid

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

down his spindle and hurried to the field and found that the
Grasshoppers had eaten up all the corn. He then grabbed a stick and,
knowing where he had seen the Grasshoppers before, and also seeing their
tracks in the sand, he followed them.

It seems that on returning they had not been flying, but walking. When
he came upon them he found that they were resting and sleeping, as they
had filled themselves so full with the corn. He jumped into the wash
saying: "Ishohí, you have eaten my corn," and began pounding them with
his stick. He killed a great many, but others escaped. He destroyed
their houses there entirely, and that is the reason why now the
grasshoppers do not all live at one place, but may he found almost
anywhere. Hereupon he went home, being sad at heart. When he came home
he chided his daughter saying: "Why did you tell them about our
corn-field? They are bad." But he added: "I have only you alone, and I
shall not be angry at you. That corn will sprout and grow again."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_179"></span>[236:1](toth100.htm#fr_181.md) Told by Qöyáwaima
(Oraíbi).

<span id="fn_180"></span>[237:1](toth100.htm#fr_182.md) The meaning of some
of the words only is known. The first word is probably derived from
"yáyalawa" (damage), referring to the damage done by the Grasshoppers in
the corn-field, "yamóshkiki" expresses such ideas as swarming, crowding
each other. "ruk" is said to refer to the rubbing of the legs against
the wings by the Grasshoppers.
