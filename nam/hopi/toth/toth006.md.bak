## 5. THE ORIGIN OF SOME ORAÍBI CLANS. <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md)

Away down the sípapu in the under-world the people lived in the same
manner as they do here. The wife of the chief of the Bear clan often
danced in the Butterfly dance (Políhtikivee), at which the chief got
angry. The Spider clan had also a chief. The Bear chief sent the
Pö'okong to limit for them another life (kátci) or world and see whether
they could not get out. He was so angry at his wife's participating in
the dance, fearing that she would be led astray, he wanted to go away
and leave her.

Pö'okong and his younger brother Balö'ongahoya went in search of another
world, and when they returned, reported that there was an opening right
above them. Pö'okong had reached it by means of a reed on which he had
spit and thus made it strong. The chief said, as they were still dancing
(the Butterfly dance) they would move in four days. After four days they
were still dancing, and the chief said to some one that he would not
tell his wife anything, but try to find another wife. So he left, being
accompanied by Pö'okong and, Balö'ongahoya, the Pölis still dancing
wildly. They started and went out, Pö'okong first, then Balö'ongahoya,
then the Bear clan chief, who was followed by the Spider clan chief.
Then the Bear clan people, the Spider clan people, and after them many
other people came out. When many were out the Bear chief closed the
opening. When they were out the chief said, ''Well, what now?" They were
in the dark yet, the entrance, however, being closed. The chief sent the
Eagle who flew around hunting an opening or light. H returned, and the
chief asked: ''Taá um hin nawóti?" "Well, I found an opening and made it
more light, but it is very hot high up yet. Send another one." So the
chief sent the Buzzard (Wicóko). The latter ascended higher but got
burned (hence he has no feathers on his head and wings), but he made it
lighter, When he returned that chief said: "Thank

you. Well, now what? Now it is somewhat better. The sky has been opened
somewhat more and it is much lighter." The question arose: Which way?
The Bear clan spoke for the South, the Spider clan for the north, and
the latter talking more and getting the greater crowd, the Spider clan
went northward.
