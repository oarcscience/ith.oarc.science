## 42.--THE BLIND MAN AND THE LAME MAN.

Earthquake at Oraíbi frightens people and all run north. Blind man asks
cripple for information. They call to each other to come over and
finally blind man takes stick and feels his way to cripple's house.
Cripple suggests that they also flee, blind man to carry cripple on his
back and cripple to show way. Thus they follow others. Elk meets them
and cripple wonders what it is. From his description blind man
concludes, it is elk. They have bow and arrow, and cripple suggests that
blind man shall shoot it, cripple to aim for him. Blind man shoots and
kills elk. They have nothing with which to skin animal or cut meat, but
they dig eyes out with arrow. They make fire and place eyes on it. Eyes
get hot and burst with great report. They jump. and lame man can wall,
and blind man can see. They remain awake all night lest they should
become lame and blind again. In morning they follow tracks of people and
find them in timber. People return to Oraíbi, those two taking lead.
