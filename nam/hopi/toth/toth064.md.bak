## 61. BÁLÖLÖOKONGWUU <span id="fr_129"></span>[2](#fn_127) AND THE COYOTE. <span id="fr_130"></span>[3](#fn_128.md)

Alíksai! In Mishóngnovi, where there are now the ruins of old
Mishóngnovi, they were living. East of there the Lölö'okong also

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

lived, and south from there, at Jack-Rabbit House (Covíihkivee), lived
the Coyote. He was a friend of the Lölö'okong. "I am going to visit my
friend," the Lölö'okong said one day, so in the evening he went over to
his friend's kiva. The Lölö'okong was very long. When he arrived at the
Coyote's house the latter said, "Come in." "All right," he replied.
"Come in," his friend repeated, so he went in and kept coiling up until
he filled the entire kiva. So they were sitting and conversing there.
"Now let us eat something," the Coyote said. "Very well," his visitor
replied. So the Coyote brought forth some juniper berries, which they
ate. "Thanks, that I have eaten," the Lölö'okong said.

By this time it had become quite late. "I am going home now," the
Lölö'okong said. "All right," his host replied, "it is getting late."
And after having invited the Coyote to visit him also, the Lölö'okong
left. After his visitor had left the Coyote was thinking: "What shall I
do to my friend, as I want to repay him?" The next day he went into the
timber and got a big armful of dry cedar bark. This he tied into a long
rope, as it were, with yucca leaves, and rolled it up in his kiva. He
then fastened it to his tail and went out. After having run around for
some time, he went to his friend's house. "Have you come?" the latter
said. "Yes, I have come." "All right, come in, come in," the Lölö'okong
said. So he went in and kept circling around and around and around,
filling the whole kiva with his long tail. On the walls of the kiva of
the Lölö'okong were hanging many snake costumes, and the Coyote kept
looking and looking at them. "Now let us eat," the host finally said,
and getting from a shelf a very small bowl with some corn-pollen, set it
before his visitor. "This I am eating; eat of it too," he said to the
Coyote. So they talked together until evening. "It is evening," finally
the Coyote said. "I am going home now." "Very well," the Lölö'okong
replied, "we are through talking, and it is evening."

The Coyote hereupon left the kiva, dragging his long tail after him.
When the latter was nearly unwound, the Lölö'okong put a little piece of
ember on the tail, which set it on fire, a lid when this was dragged out
of the kiva, it set the grass on fire. The Coyote looked around and was
wondering who was setting everything on fire after him. When the tail
was nearly consumed he had arrived at his kiva, and then he began to
think that maybe his friend had done that to him. "Well now," he said,
"he is my friend, and that friend has treated me this way," And then he
became very angry at the Lölö'okong. He then entered his kiva and
continued to live there.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_127"></span>[187:2](toth064.htm#fr_129.md) Told by Sik'áhpiki
(Shupaúlavi).

<span id="fn_128"></span>[187:3](toth064.htm#fr_130.md) Bálölöokongwuu (the
abbreviated term Bálölöokong being usually used) is a mythical serpent,
supposed to control the water and to live in the ocean, springs, etc.
Lö1ö'okongwuu (abr. Lölö'okong) is really the Bull Snake, but this term
is often used for Bálölöokong, as is seen in this story.
