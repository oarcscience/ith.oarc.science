## 87. THE LITTLE GRAY MICE AND THE LITTLE BROWN MICE. <span id="fr_166"></span>[2](#fn_164)

A long time ago the Little Gray Mice (Pövö'yamu) lived at Tumble Down
Bluff (Tûkwíshahpukpu), south-east of the village, and the Little Brown
Mice (Pavávumshamu) lived at Chiróve, west of the village, far down the
mesa. The two kinds of mice were on friendly terms at that time. During
the night they would come to the village and whenever one would find
hidden away in jars or packed away in the rooms, corn, etc., it would
invite the others and then they would come and carry away the food to
their holes. This they did a long time. The two kinds of mice would
often visit each other and dance together. They would usually sing the
following song, both parties it seems generally using the same words:

Talawyayna talawyaynaaa  
It begins to dawn, it begins to dawn.  
Ahaha, ihihi. Talawyayna, talawyaynana,  
Yaoohoo, oohia, ahaha ihihi.

One time one of the Gray Mice had found something very good to eat,
perhaps peaches, and ran over to the Brown Mice, saving: ''I have found
some good food and I have already made a hole in the cover so that we
can get at it." Hereupon they all came from both

places, but when they were carrying their food away to their houses they
commenced to quarrel over it and had a great fight. Many were bitten,
although none were killed. After a few days the Gray Mice went over to
the Brown Mice again, entered their kiva and danced. They changed their
song somewhat, however, singing as follows:

Talawyayna, talawyayna.  
It begins to dawn, it begins to dawn.  
Ahaha ihihi,  
Talawyayna, talawyayna, ahaha, ihihi,  
Yaoohoo oohio,  
Pas nu pawupshat wupashurut  
Very I (of) big mice, long tails  
Mamkashi, (afraid), Pi nuu, pi nuu! O! I! O! I!  
Yaoohoo oohia  
Pas nu yan töonumkat mamkashi  
Very I thus whistlers afraid (of)  
Pi! nuu! pi, nuu! Pu yââmi! Pu yââmi.  
O! I! O! I! Now off! now off!

When they were through singing they rushed out of the kiva back to their
home. The Brown Mice laughed at them, saying: "Aha, they are afraid of
us." The two kinds of mice have never been on good terms since, and from
that time they began to scatter out through the fields and through the
houses, and that is the reason why they now may be found everywhere.
