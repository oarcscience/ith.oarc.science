## 45.--HOW THE CHILDREN OF PIVÁNHONK'API OBTAINED PERMISSION TO CATCH BIRDS.

Children living at Hukovi and at Pivánhonk'api go to spring to trap
birds. They are angry with each other. Hukovi children tell others they
will not trap birds there, but that they can if they give them
something. Children from Pivánhonk'api go and get food, which they give
to children from Hukovi. After that, children from both villages always
catch birds there.
