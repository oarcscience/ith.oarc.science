## 101. THE DESTRUCTION OF PIVÁNHONK'API. <span id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_184.md)

A long time ago there lived some people north of Oraíbi close to the
north of the place where the Oraíbi at present dry their peaches. They
were called Yáyaponchatu. There was only one village of them, probably
only a small one. The villages of Pivánhonkapi, about four miles
northwest of Oraíbi, and Hû'ckovi, about two miles northwest of Oraíbi,
which have been in ruins long ago, were then, too, still inhabited. The
people in Pivánhonkapi seemed to have been very much degenerated. The
village chief of that village was much worried over it, especially over
the fact that the women of that village would even participate in the
games of chance, especially that of totólocpi, in the kivas; even the
chief's wife was no exception. It is stated that she would even neglect
her children when she was gambling in the kivas. Sometimes he would say
to her, in order to get her out of the kiva, that she should go and
nurse their little child that was crying outside. The chief finally
became concerned and angry over the condition of affairs to such a
degree that he decided to adopt severe measures. So he went to the
village of the Yáyaponchatu, who were known to have special influence
over and with storms and fire, and who, in fact, were looked upon as
being in league with supernatural forces. "I have come to you," he said.
"For what purpose?" they asked him. "My people," he said, "are dark
hearted; they are bad. They will not listen to me. The women are
gambling to such an extent that they are even neglecting their duties
and their children. I want you to punish my people." They said that he
should choose the element with which they were to exercise judgment,
either the fire or the storm. He chose the fire and went home, telling
them, however, that in four days they were going to have a dance in his
village, and invited them to participate in the celebration. On his way
home he stopped at the village of Hû'ckovi, telling his friend, the
chief of this village, to come and see him in the evening and to bring
his friend, his assistant, whose name is not known, with him. When
meeting in the evening, in the house of the chief of Pivánhonkapi, the
latter told his two friends all about the matter, also that in four days
they were going to have a dance in his village and inviting them also to
come and take part in the dance, which they promised to do. So

these three 'People were the only ones in possession of the secret. On
the fourth day they had a series of dances. During the day the different
kind of Katcina were dancing at each dance, and leaving the village when
they had completed their performances. The Yáyaponchatu people performed
the last (lance. They were masked like the Hóhe Katcina of the present
day, their bodies, however, being decorated like certain personages that
appear at the Soyál ceremonies at present, taking from the kiva in which
the ceremonies were performed certain prayer-offerings, which they
deposited at a large spring west of the village. The Yáyaponchatu were
sprinkled with corn-meal the same as all the other Katcinas, whereupon
they performed their dance, and while they were dancing they sang the
following ominous song, alluding to the judgment that was to befall
them:

Ahaha, Ihihi  
Hiayiayiayhaaa  
Hiayiayiayhaa  
Pai nû'vûpi yepee.  
Why, at last here  
Uni uh kiyu  
You your houses  
Palaomawuy akwa  
Red cloud with  
Nöömiltiqöö  
When enveloped  
Hakami yang  
Somewhere over there  
Pamöci conako  
The mist through  
Naiikwilmuyionihüi  
Carrying one another  
Kiihkiihki nawitaha  
Villages along  
Ahaha, Ihihi.

Some of the spectators, watching the dances from the house-tops, when
they heard the song became somewhat alarmed and began to think and talk
of the matter. Nobody, of course, fully understood the meaning of the
song and of the presence of these strange neighbors. Four of these last
named dancers carried certain prayer-offerings the same as are now being
deposited during the Soyál ceremony by the aforesaid messengers. These
prayer-offerings consisted of sacred meal piled up in small trays. Into
these trays are placed a number of little

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

husk packets, which are supposed to contain sacred meal mixed with
honey. These little packets are fastened to nakwákwosis. But the
prayer-offerings carried by the four dancers on that occasion also had a
little spark of fire over each one of these packets. At the conclusion
of the dance one of these was handed to the village chief of
Pivánhonkapi, the other to the village chief of Hû'ckovi, the third to
the latter's assistant and friend, and the fourth was retained by the
leader of these last named dancers.

Late in the evening the chief from Hû'ckovi and his friend came to the
chief of Pivánhonkapi and all three smoked over the prayer-offerings
which they had received from the Yáyaponchatu. Then the chief from
Hû'ckovi sent his friend with one of them to the San Francisco
Mountains, which are situated about ninety miles to the south-west, to
deposit the same there among the trees and high grass. The other two the
two chiefs kept, each one hiding his one away in some lower room in his
house. Tradition does not mention what the chief of the Yáyaponchatu did
with his prayer-offering, beyond the fact that he took it home with him.
This was during the night following the dance. The next night the women
and some of the men again assembled in the kivas to gamble. Some of the
men, however, did not participate. They all at once noticed a light in
the San Francisco Mountains and remarked about it, mentioning it also to
those in the kiva. The latter ridiculed them, and took no notice of it.
The next night the same thing was repeated, only the fire in the
mountains appeared to be larger. Those who were outside of the kiva,
looking on and watching the gambling, again mentioned the fact to the
others, but the latter again showed themselves skeptical. During the day
also they had observed smoke at the same place, without, however, taking
special notice of it. During the third night the fire became larger, and
those who noticed it became somewhat alarmed, but their remarks upon the
fact again met deaf ears. On the following day the smoke arising from
the San Francisco Mountains seemed to be threatening, and those few that
were considered the better class of the people became alarmed. During
the fourth night the people again continued their gambling and
carousing, those outside watching with great alarm the fire on the San
Francisco Mountains, which now began to spread itself towards the Hopi
villages. They told the people so and asked them to come out of the kiva
and see for themselves. The latter again laughed at them saying: "You
only want us to stop our playing. We do not believe what you say." At
short intervals their attention was drawn to the approaching fire with
more persistence and in more urgent language, but without avail.

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

Finally one of the players came out of the kiva to see for himself, and
when he saw the air full of smoke and the fire rolling towards the
villages, he cried out in despair to those in the kiva that the reports
about the approaching disaster were only too true. When the latter also
saw the smoke they rushed out of the kiva and to their houses, trying to
gather some of their effects before fleeing. But the fire was now upon
them and most of those who had procrastinated were either suffocated or
burned to death. Only a very few escaped from the two villages. These,
it is said, left that part of the country. They lived at certain places
for a little while and then moved on. It is said that some of the small
ruins in these parts of the country mark the sites of the temporary
houses of these former inhabitants of Pivánhonkapi and Hû'ckovi.

The village chief of Oraíbi, when becoming aware of the approaching
danger, became very much worried. "My children are dear to me," he said,
"and I do not want to have them destroyed." So he quickly proceeded to
the house of Spider Woman, which is situated South of the village,
half-way down the mesa. She advised him to at once make two arrows,
using on the shafts the feathers of the bluebird and wuríñawuu. This he
did. When he was done he sent out a messenger with one arrow,
instructing him to thrust it into the ground west of the village at the
foot of the mesa. The other one he took to the shrine of Achámali, north
of the village, where he thrust it into the ground in front of the
shrine. Spider Woman then wove a network of web between the two arrows
which she moistened with water. When the fire reached this protecting
network of moist spider-web its force was broken and the village of
Oraíbi saved from destruction.
