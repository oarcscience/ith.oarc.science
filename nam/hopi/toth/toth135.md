## 22.--HOW PÖ'OKONG KILLED THE BEAR.

Bear kills people living at Mishóngnovi. Pö'okong lives with grandmother
at Skeleton Katcina house. Chief makes bow and arrows and also buckskin
ball for Pö'okong and báho for grandmother. He takes them to house and
asks Pö'okong to kill bear. Pö'okong hunts bear and shoots him in throat
and hits him with ball stick. He skins bear and fills skin with dry
grass. Then he ties it to himself and drags it very fast, screaming.
People see him and tell grandmother bear is following him. He ascends
house and throws bear to grandmother, who is scared, and dies. Pö'okong
wakes her up and she whips him for searing her. Chief happy, as bear
stops killing people.
