## 53.--THE CHILD WHO TURNED INTO AN OWL.

In Shupaúlávi child cries bitterly and mother beats it. She tells it she
will throw it out to the owl and drags child out of house. Large Owl
comes and carries child off on his back. He takes child to cave, where
his children are living nicely. Then mother no longer hears crying. She
comes and looks for child, but it has gone. In morning she hunts for it,
but cannot find it. Men going after wood, on passing Owl's cave, hear
singing. They look up and in cave see child which has feathers and white
spots of owl appearing all over body, and eyes becoming yellow. On
return to village they tell what they have seen. Parents of child
proceed with men to place. Men climb up to cave and take child. Owl
tells them to keep child locked in room four days and let it out on
fourth day when sun rises. It will then be Hopi. If door is opened
sooner, child will remain Owl and go back. They take child to village
and lock it up in room. Father watches. After first day mother is
anxious to open door, but father forbids. When it begins to be light
after third night, she open,, door and out rushes Owl, which rises up
and flies to place it has come from.
