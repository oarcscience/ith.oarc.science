## 91. THE SPARROW-HAWK AND THE HÂ'KWÂ. <span id="fr_172"></span>[1](#fn_170.md)

A long time ago the people lived in Oraíbi and in Shongópavi. A little
distance north-east of Oraíbi, at a place called
Sparrow-Hawk-Catching-Place (Kâlâ'tipka), lived a little
Sparrow-Hawk. <span id="fr_173"></span>[2](#fn_171.md) Farther down in the
rock lived a large Hâ'kwâ. The Sparrow-Hawk caught many lizards, <span
id="fr_174"></span>[3](#fn_172.md) for its brood, but would never attempt
to catch the Hâ'kwâ, so that the latter began to think the Sparrow-Hawk
was afraid of it, and remarked on it. "Why is that little Sparrow-Hawk
afraid of me?" he asked. ''I am so fat, and I am sure the Sparrow-Hawk
is very anxious to have me, but he is afraid of me." These thoughts the
Hâ'kwâ soon put into a song and teased the tittle Sparrow-Hawk by
singing the following song, dashing into a large crack in the rock as
soon as it had sung the last word of the song:

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This somewhat irritated the Sparrow-Hawk, who warned the Hâ'kwâ in the I
following words: "Why are you talking there; I am not afraid of you; I
could kill you if I wanted to do so, but I do not want you, you are
dirty." Soon the Hâ'kwâ came out and sang the same song again. The
Sparrow-Hawk became more angry and repeated its warning. The little bird
then began to make plans to kill the Hâ'kwâ, but did not know just how
to go about it, but when the latter had sung the song four times the
Sparrow-Hawk was very angry and was determined to kill the Hâ'kwâ.

By this time the young Sparrow-Hawks in the nest had become large.
enough to be able to fly, so the mother told them: "Let us kill that
Hâ'kwâ down there. He has made me very angry and says I am anxious to
have him, and am afraid of him. Now, I want to kill him." Hereupon he
instructed one of the young Hawks to follow him to the top of the rock.
Here he placed the little Hawk on the same stone where he had always
been sitting when the Hâ'kwâ had angered him, and then flew away.

The Hâ'kwâ again came out of the crack, and mistaking the young
Sparrow-Hawk for the old one, he began in a taunting manner to sing his
song. The Sparrow-Hawk had in the meanwhile made a large circuit, and
just as the Hâ'kwâ was singing the word "Hanák" the Sparrow-Hawk swooped
down on him saving: "What, are you singing again! I am not afraid of
you; I am going to kill you now and then we are going to devour you."
Hereupon he grabbed him with both talons and killed him, and took him
home to his nest. He found that the Hâ'kwâ was indeed very fat. Then he
and his brood lived upon the Hâ'kwâ until the latter were large enough
to leave the nest and take care of themselves.
