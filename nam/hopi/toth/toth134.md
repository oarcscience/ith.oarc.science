## 21.--HOW THE PÖ'OKONGS DESTROYED CÓOYOKO AND HIS WIFE.

Many people living in Oraíbi. Some who go for wood do not return. Man,
while gathering wood, bears Cóoyoko singing. Cóoyoko says he will feast
on man, but man crawls under wood and Cóoyoko cannot find him. Cóoyoko
then finds woman and says he will feast on her. Woman climbs tree and
micturates. Cóoyoko sees moisture and says there must be clouds
somewhere. Cóoyoko leaves place. Man and woman go to village and say it
is Cóoyoko who kills people. Village chief goes to shrine where
Pö'okongs live with grandmother, Spider Woman. They are playing, but
woman makes them stop. Chief tells them that he wants them to take
revenge on Cóoyoko for killing people. They promise to help him if he
will make them some balls. Brothers take bow and lightning arrows. They
strike ball before them forward and backward, until they arrive at
Cóoyoko's house. He and wife have gone, but they follow wife's tracks
and find her sitting. They kill her with arrows. They go again to house
and wait return of Cóoyoko. He comes singing, and throws something down.
He enters kiva and hunts for something

to eat. Pö'okongs have hidden themselves behind mealing bin, and kill
him with lightning arrows. They scalp him and return home with many
beads and other things. Village chief makes two balls out of buckskin
and two ball sticks, which he takes to Pö'okongs. After that Hopi always
return when they go after wood.
