## 23.--THE PÖ'OKONGS ATTEND A DANCE.

Pöokongs live with grandmother, Spider Woman, at Achámali. They go to
look on at dance at Shongópavi. They throw wheels and shoot arrows at
them as they go. They come to sand hill where grass is waving, producing
hissing noise. They sit down and look at grass dancing. In evening they
return and tell grandmother, who calls them fools. She sends them to see
dance at Mishóngnovi, and tells them about tray throwing. They get to
Mishóngnovi and see dance, but they are so filth, no one invites them to
eat. They snatch trays from dancers and run home. They give trays to
grandmother, who feeds them, but they are angry at not being fed in
Mishóngnovi. Hopi find salt, but salt belongs to Pö'okongs, who remove
it far away to give Hopi trouble in getting it.
