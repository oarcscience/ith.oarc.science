## 20.--PÖOKÓNGHOYA AND HIS BROTHER AS THIEVES.

Pö'okong and his brother live near Shongópavi with grandmother. They
play with ball, striking it towards Toríva. They drink at spring and see
many báhos. Younger brother swallows báho. Elder brother discovers bowls
of paints deposited in recess by Flute priests. He puts some of each
paint into ball through holes, and sews them up. They proceed towards
Mishóngnovi, and beat ball through village. They enter kiva where Flute
priests are assembled and grab tray with lightning frame, thunder board,
netted water jug, etc. They go to kiva where Snake priests assembled,
and grab bull-snake and carry it off in sack. They beat ball to corn-ear
bluffs, where they find many báhos and prayer-offerings. Elder brother
refuses to take prayer-offerings, but younger one takes corn báho,
watermelon, and melon. They start for Shongópavi and shoot lightning
frame and twirl bullroarer. Clouds gather and there is thunder storm.
They run towards house and again use lightning frame and thunder board.
It thunders hard and lightning flashes. They rush into house and put
things they have stolen into two pots, which they cover up. It rains,
and Hopi have good crops because Pöokóngyas have those things.
