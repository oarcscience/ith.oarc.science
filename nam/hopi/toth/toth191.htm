<p>Sparrow-hawk eats all grasshopper children. Their parents mourn loss. Coyote comes along and tells Grasshopper mother she is singing nicely and asks her to sing to him. She says she is crying for her children, but Coyote threatens to devour her if she does not sing to him. She sings and Coyote runs away singing song. He stumbles over rock and loses song. He returns to place where he left Grasshopper woman, and, seeing stone resembling her which she had put in her place, he tells it to sing again. Receiving no reply, he grabs stone and breaks teeth. He hunts for food, but cannot eat it, as he has no teeth, and finally perishes with hunger.</p>
