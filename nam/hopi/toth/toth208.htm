<p>Bee and &Aacute;sya are both women and have children. They are great friends. &Aacute;sya has peach orchard and relishes peaches very much. She visits Bee, who feeds her honey. They converse all day and &Aacute;sya asks Bee to visit her in morning. Bee has no wings and walks to friend's house. &Aacute;sya gives her seat and feeds her peaches. She asks Bee if she likes peaches. Bee suggests she shall make some medicine for peaches, as they are sour. &Aacute;sya consents and Bee puts honey on them, making them sweet. &Aacute;sya is happy and pulls out some feathers for Wings, which she attaches to Bee. She teaches Bee how to fly and ever since bees can fly.</p>
