## 60. THE COYOTE AND THE BÁLÖLÖOKONG <span id="fr_128"></span>[1](#fn_126) (WATER SERPENT.md).

Alíksai! The Oraíbis were living in their village. There were many of
them. The Bálölöokong was living at Flute Spring (Lânangva), west of the
village. Somewhat south of this spring, at Íshmovala, the Coyote was
living. They were great friends and often visited each other. One time
Bálölöokong came out of his kiva in the spring and went over to his
friend's kiva, which he entered, filling it up entirely so that the
Coyote had to go out and remain there while they were conversing. After
they had conversed a while, Bálölöokong returned to his kiva.

The Coyote was angry that he had to remain outside and was meditating
how he could take revenge on his friend, and finally formed a plan. He
went to the woods and brought with him a large armful of cedar bark and
also some yucca leaves. He wrapped the bark with leaves, always adding
wool to it so that it finally formed a large artificial tail. This he
tied to his own tail and then went over to pay his friend a visit.
Entering the kiva of the latter, he also kept going around until his
tail filled the entire kiva, and Bálölöokong had to go out and also
remain outside while they conversed with each other.

When they were through talking, the Coyote left, and had not yet quite
left the kiva when Bálölöokong rushed into the kiva and shoved the
artificial tail of the Coyote on the fireplace and set it on fire. When
the Coyote had drawn it out of the kiva entirely, the grass through
which he was running was set on fire. He thought that the people of the
village were trying to drive him away by setting the grass on fire, and
so he ran westward, setting everything on fire that he came in contact
with. Finally he reached the Little Colorado River. By this time the
fire on his tail had reached his natural tail and he jumped into the
river and tried to swim across, but perished.
