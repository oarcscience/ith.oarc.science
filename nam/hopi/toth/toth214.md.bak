## 102.--THE DESTRUCTION OF SIKYÁTKI.

Racer Katcinas come to Wálpi from Sikyátki to race. Wálpi man cuts off
hair knot of Katcina instead of small portion of side lock. Katcina is
angry. He returns to Sikyátki and practices running. Wálpi come to have
race at Sikyátki. Young man is still angry, and, taking knife, goes on
bluff opposite Sikyátki. During dance he comes down and enters plaza. He
races with clowns and catches them all, cutting off small portion of
side locks. He detects on top of house sister of man who had cut his
hair. He dashes to top of house, follows her and cuts off her head.
Holding it by hair whorl, he swings head and dashes away. People follow
him, but he escapes and returns to village by another trail. People of
villages quarrel, but Wálpi withdraw. People of Sikyátki are very
wicked, especially towards women. As they do not spare chief's wife, he
determines to take revenge. He agrees with chief of Wálpi that when
people are planting in valley, Wálpi shall come to village and destroy
it. Wálpi have balls of pitch and when Sikyátki people are in fields
they rush upon village and kill women and children. Then they set houses
on fire destroying village. People planting see smoke and rush to
village, but only have planting sticks. Wálpi are well armed and kill
all people, including chief who instigated revenge.
