## 18.--THE TWO WAR GODS AND THE TWO MAIDENS.

Pöokónghoya and little brother Balö'ngahoya hear of two beautiful
maidens, and go to visit them. Maidens think they have gone to marry
them, and say they may own them if they will each have arm cut off. They
consent, and maidens cut off right arm of young brother and then of
elder brother with upper mealing stone. They carry severed arms home and
tell grandmother how mischief happened. She asks them to lay down north
of fireplace, places arms by their sides, covers them up, and sings.
When through singing, they get up healed. Next day they go to house of
maidens. Pöokónghoya wants

to choose prettiest, but younger brother objects, as he had his arm cut
off first. His brother consents, and they sleep with maidens that night,
and then return home.
