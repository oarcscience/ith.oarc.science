## 74.--THE COYOTE AND THE BADGER.

Coyote and Badger are great friends. Oraíbi are cleaning out spring and
maidens take food and place it near rock. Coyote watches people as they
eat and envies them. Next day Coyote bears criers announce another
spring cleaning. He goes to Badger's house and tells him. He suggests
that they take part in eating. Badger follows Coyote to his house, from
which Badger begins to dig hole towards where food is. After Badger has
gone little way he turns round. Coyote thinks he is turning back and
goes for mole. Mole returns with Coyote and rapidly digs hole
underground. Badger follows enlarging hole, and Coyote scratches out
loose dirt. Mole continues hole to rock and while Hopi are at work he
reaches food and hands it to Badger and Badger to Coyote, who carries it
to his house. When Hopi are through with work, chief sends maidens for
food. They go to rock and find food gone. Coyote, Badger and Mole divide
food, on which they live for some time. Afterwards Coyote visits Badger,
who has cut into small pieces some lölö'okyongs and roasted them. Coyote
eats food with relish and asks Badger where he got it. He replies that
he opened his side and took fat from his intestines. He shows

hold of fat and pulls at it, but becomes exhausted, falls over and dies.
When Badger arrives he finds Coyote dead.
