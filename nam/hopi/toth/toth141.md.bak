Youth always sits on edge of mesa thinking about graveyard, and whether
those buried there are living somewhere. He gets corn meal and prays to
sun for information. He prays four days and sun comes and gives him
something to eat, when he sleeps in evening. He tells parents, and that
when sun is high up they are to work on him that he may wake up. In
evening he eats medicine. He dies. and goes to Skeleton house. He sees
trail. On north side he descends. He sees somebody whom he recognizes
and who asks him to carry him four steps, but he goes on. Woman carrying
something asks him to take burden from her, but he says he is in hurry.
Man carrying mealing stone asks him to take it. Then he runs fast and
comes to man shaking bell very loudly. It is Kwánitaka, who explains
what he has seen. He goes on and sees another Kwánitaka ringing. They go
on together and see fire in deep place where wicked ones in Oraíbi are
burned and come out as smoke. They come to very dark, deep place from
which those who are thrown in never come out. Youth returns to first
Kwánitaka, who directs him to village. Here he finds Kwánitaka, and he
sees chiefs he had known in Oraíbi living in blossoms. He sees all kinds
of grass, plants, and blossoms. Kwánitaka tells him that those not
wicked in Oraíbi will come there. He is to tell his parents what he has
seen, and run fast as they are waiting for him. He runs fast, and
passing again all those he had seen before, he arrives at house in
Oraíbi and enters body. He awakes. When they have eaten, he tells them
what he has seen. Young man wants to go back again. He tells parents,
