## 26. THE PÖ'OKONGS AND THE BÁLÖLÖOKONG. <span id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_69.md)

Alíksai! In Mishóngnovi where now are the ruins, the people lived, and
there lived a family consisting of a father, mother, a youth, and a
maiden. One day at noon the latter went after water to Toríva. There was
a great deal of water in the spring at that time. As she was dipping out
the water it began to move and a Bálölöokong came out. He at once began
to draw the maiden with strong inhalations towards him, embraced her,
and disappeared with her into the water. Her mother was waiting for her
to return, but she did not come. When she did not return the mother
began to worry and said she would go and look for her. Following her
tracks and not meeting her on the way, she went down to the spring.
There she hunted for her tracks but only found them descending to the
water. The jug was standing there, but the daughter could not be found,
so she

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

finally picked up the jug and the old blanket in which the jug had been
carried and went home. "I have found the tracks," she said to her
husband, "but they simply lead to the edge of the water, and cannot find
our child anywhere." "Oh!" the father replied; so the father bestirred
himself and made a ball and an arrow: to the latter he tied some
blue-bird feathers. These he took to the house of Pöokónghoya and his
younger brother Balö'ongahoya, who lived somewhat higher up, north of
the village.

When he arrived at their house the two youths were romping about. "Be
quiet," their grandmother, Spider Woman, said, "be quiet, somebody has
come here." So they were quiet. "Sit down, sit down," she said to the
man, and then set some hurúshiki <span id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_70.md)
before him, of which he ate. It was just a small ball, but as he ate
from it it kept increasing again. When he was done she said to him, "Now
why do you come? What is the matter?" "Yes," he said, "yes, yesterday
our daughter went after water and she did not return. Her foot tracks
only lead to the edge of the stream, and now I came here, as you have a
strong heart, and thought that may be you could do something for us."
Hereupon he handed two bows to the youths and an eagle nakwákwosi, which
he had also prepared, to Spider Woman. They were all happy over these
things. "Askwalí," she said, "yes, these, my youths, know about it, for
they have seen it. Bálölöokong dragged your daughter into the water, and
to-morrow we will bestir ourselves and we shall go there. Now, you go
back and invite your friends and you must also go to work making
nakwákwosis." Spider Woman also instructed him that they should then
dress up the brother of the maiden.

So he went home, invited his friends, and they made many nakwákwosis
which they placed into a handsome tray. Early the next morning Spider
Woman and the two youths repaired to the village. When they had arrived
there they dressed up the brother of the lost maiden, putting a kilt,
sash, bunch of breath feathers, numerous strands of beads, and ear
pendants on him. He took a ball in his right hand, and the taláwayi (a
stick with two eagle feathers and a string of horse hair attached to it)
in his left hand. The father took the tray with prayer-offerings, and
the chief of the village also went along. Spider Woman told the young
man not to be afraid. While the Pö'okong and his younger brother would
sing at the spring he should dance, and if the Bálölöokong pitied them
and would come out With his sister, he should not be afraid and he
should not cry, but should grab his sister and then strike the
Bálölöokong with the tonípi

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

(a club with a stone attached to it), which the Pö'okongs had handed to
him.

When they had arrived at the spring they stood there. "Now we are
ready," the young man said. Hereupon the Pö'okongs sing the following
song:

While they were singing the young man was shaking his ball and holding
the taláwayi in his left arm, dancing at the edge of the spring to the
time of the singing. All at once the water began to move and the
Bálölöokong came out holding the maiden in his left arm. She was still
nicely dressed, having her turquoise ear-pendants still in her ears. "My
elder brother," she said, to her brother, "take me. ''Yes, you go nearer
now, and have a big heart, but do not cry," Spider Woman urged him. So
he approached the edge of the spring and reached for his sister. But as
he did so he began to cry and immediately the Bálölöokong disappeared in
the water with the maiden. "Oh!" they all said. "Now let us try it
again," Spider Woman suggested. "Let us try, it once more, but you must
not be afraid; you must have a big heart; you must not cry. I did not
tell you you must do this way, but have a big heart this time." And now
they were ready again.

As they were singing the same song that they had sung before, the young
man again shaking his ball and dancing at the edge of the water, the
water again began to move and the Bálölöokong once more came out, again
holding the mána in his left arm. ''Now go nearer, close to the edge,"
Spider Woman urged him, "do not be afraid now" So he danced slowly to
the edge of the water and again his sister reached out her hands towards
him and said: "My elder brother, take me." So when he was still dancing
he held out his hand, grasped the maiden and struck the Bálölöokong on
the head with the club. Immediately the serpent released the maiden and
only his skin was floating on the water like a sack. "Thanks the maiden
said, "thanks! You were slow in taking me, you cried." Hereupon he drew
her out of the water. "Thanks!" Spider Woman said, "thanks that you were
not too late." Hereupon they put other clothes on the

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

maiden and laid a pûhu of red feathers for her on the path. <span
id="fr_73"></span>[1](toth030.htm#fn_71.md) The tray with all the
nakwákwosis they threw into the spring for the maiden, because with this
price they had purchased the mána back from the water serpent. And they
threw the prayer-offerings into the spring that nothing further should
befall the mána.

They then returned to the village, but it seems that Bálölöokong just
left his skin and slipped back into the water when he was struck,
because he is still there and is occasionally seen by women, and whoever
sees him becomes sick. Only lately, the narrator continued, he was seen
by a woman, Corn-Ear (Káö), but the women that have seen him say that he
now is just small. One time he was also seen by a man. Sometimes those
who see him get sick, because he is dangerous.

After they had returned to the village Spider Woman and the two
Pö'okongs returned to their house. And so that way they were in time to
save the mána.
