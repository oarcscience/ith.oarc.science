## 72.--THE CHÍRO AND THE COYOTE.

Coyote walking about sees Chíros dancing and singing. He wants to dance
and Chíros give him feathers, making him wings and tail and putting
small feathers into his body. They dance and sing again, Coyote with
them, and then they fly upward very high. Now they crowd around Coyote
and take away their feathers. Coyote falls to earth and dies. Chíros
laugh at him and are pleased that he is dead.
