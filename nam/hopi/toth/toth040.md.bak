## 37. THE YOUTH AND MAIDEN WHO PLAYED HIDE AND SEEK FOR THEIR LIFE. <span id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_94.md)

Ishyaoí! In Oraíbi the people were living. At the west end of the south
row of houses lived a youth. A short distance north-east of the present
Honáni kiva lived a maiden. One day the youth went down to the west side
of the mesa to watch his father's fields. As he passed the house of the
maiden she asked where he was going. "I am going to watch my father's
fields," he said: "May I not go along?" she asked. "Yes," he said,
thinking that she was only joking, and passed on. The mána wrapped up
some fresh píki rolls (múhpi) and followed the youth. "So you have
come," he said to her by way of greeting when she had arrived. "Yes,"
she said, and opening her blanket showed him her píki, which they ate
together. "Let us play hide and seek now," she said, "and the one who is
found four times shall be killed." "All right," he replied, "you hide
first because you wanted it." "No, you hide first," she said, and so
finally they agreed that the mána would go and hide first. "But you must
not look after me," she warned the youth, and spread her blanket
(ushímni) over him.

She then ran through the growing corn and finally hid under some û'yi
(Corrispermum hyssopi folium Linn). As soon as she had hidden she called
out "tow." The young man then commenced to hunt her but could not find
her. Finally he said: "I cannot find you, come out." So she came out and
they went back to the place where they had eaten, and the youth then
went to hide himself, covering up the mána with her blanket. He hid
under a bush of pawíhchoki. Having hidden, he called out, "tow,"
whereupon the mána hunted for him and found him. Hereupon they again
returned, the youth was covered up and the mána again went among the
growing corn to hide. Finding a large corn-stalk, she pulled out the
tassel, crawled into the opening and put the tassel in again. She then
signaled to the youth, and he came and looked for her. Following her
tracks he found. that she had been running through the corn-field. So he
hunted throughout the corn-field and then at the edge among the herbs
and grasses, but could not find her. Finally he noticed that her tracks
seemed to come to an end near a large corn-stalk, but he could not find
her anywhere. Finally he called out, "I cannot find you, where are you?"
"Here I am," she replied, and throwing out the corn-tassel she jumped
out. So for the second time he had failed to find her.

They again returned to the edge of the field, the mána now covering

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

herself up. The youth now, as, he went through the field, was thinking,
"Where shall I hide? It is time that she does not find me again." As he
passed along the edge of the field he heard a voice. "Listen to me,"
someone said. "Come up here. I have pity on you. One time she has
already found you, and she will certainly find you again." This was the
Sun. Hereupon the latter threw down a rainbow upon which the youth
climbed to the Sun, who hid him behind his back saying, "Here she will
not find you." So the mána followed his tracks all through the field,
and went to the edge of the field to a small knoll, but could not find
him. She followed them again throughout the field and returned to the
same place. By this time she was puzzled where he could be. Her hair
whorls were hanging down out of shape. She was thinking and thinking
where he might be. Finally she pressed a few drops of milk out of her
breast, examined the drops in her hand, and seeing the sun reflected in
them, she discovered the boy behind him. She at once said: "Ma, there
you are; I have found you. Come down."

The youth now again covered himself up and the mána went to hide away
the third time. But this time the youth lifted up a corner of the
covering and watched her, in which direction she went. When he followed
her tracks throughout the corn-field he could not find her. Her tracks
led to a patch of watermelons and squashes, but as the runners covered
the ground he could not find her there. He returned to the corn-field
and hunted, but not finding her anywhere he again followed her tracks to
the watermelon patch. Finally he gave up in despair and called out: "I
cannot find you, come out." She then burst open a watermelon, saying:
"Here I am, and you did not find me," and came out.

The youth by this time became unhappy. They again returned and the
maiden covering herself up, the youth went to hide away, but was very
unhappy. Running through the corn-field and along its edge, he all at
once heard a voice. "Where are you going? I have pity on you. You come
in here," and looking down he saw a small hole by the side of a small
corn-stalk. It was the house of Spider Woman. This he entered and she
quickly spun some web across the opening. The mána again went to hunt
for the youth. Running through the corn-field repeatedly, she finally
traced his tracks to the edge of the corn-field, but could not find him
anywhere. She then drew-forth from her bosom a mirror, which was
probably a quartz crystal. Through this she hunted first upward, hoping
to find him somewhere above again, but failed to find him. She then
turned it downward and all at once saw the opening of the Spider's hole
reflected

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

in it. "Come out," she at once called out, "I have found you. You are in
there." Spider Woman said: "Well, you will have to go out, she has found
you." He was very dejected by this time because there was only one
chance for him left; but he came out.

For the fourth time the mána went to hide away. The youth again lifted
up a corner of the covering and looked after her and saw that she was
again running towards the watermelon patch. On one side of the
corn-field was a ditch and as it had rained shortly before, there was
some water in this ditch and a number of tadpoles were in this water.
The mána crossed the watermelon patch, went into the ditch, entered the
water and turned into a tadpole. The boy again went in search of the
mána, following her tracks through the cornfield and through the
watermelon patch down to the ditch, but failed to find her. He returned
and hunted throughout the field, and being very tired, he returned to
the water, stooped down and drank some. He was very sad by this time,
but he hunted once more. Finally he again followed her tracks to the
edge of the water, and knowing that she must be there somewhere, he
called out: "I cannot find you, just come out," and immediately she
emerged from the water and said: "I was here when you were drinking
water and I looked right at you." He then remembered that a tadpole had
looked up out of the water when he was drinking, but he, of course,
never thought that that could be the maiden.

So they returned again to the same place, and as they went back the
youth was very much discouraged. "Only one chance left for me," he
thought, "where shall I hide that she will not find me?" After the mána
had covered herself he again went away. Passing the house of Spider
Woman, the latter said to him: "Alas! (Okiwa!) where are you going? You
go there a little to the east to your uncle, the Aha (a species of worm
that lives in rotten wood); he lives in the takáchki (a temporary shade
or shelter) and maybe he will hide you." So the youth went there and
when he arrived there called out, "My uncle, put me in there." So the
Áhû pulled out a loose knot from one of the corner poles, which was that
of a piñon-tree. This post was hollow, and into this the Áhû put the
youth, closing up the opening after he had entered. So the mána went and
hunted for the youth, following his tracks through the corn-field, and
found that he had been going up and down and back and forth, and finally
she tracked them to the aforesaid shelter. Arriving at this place she
hunted, but at first could not find him. She then put the tips of her
right hand fingers, one after another, into her mouth, wet them
slightly, then pressed the point of her forefinger into her right ear,
and

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

immediately she heard the youth in his hiding place and told him to come
out, as she had found him.

They then returned to their place again, but the mána said: "Let us now
return again to the shelter where I found you." So they returned and sat
down close to the shelter on the north side. The mána hereupon dug a
hole close to one of the corner posts and then said to the youth: "I
have beaten you, I have beaten you. You take off your shirt." he did so.
It was a blue shirt such as the Hopi used to wear. "Now take off your
beads," she said, and, not knowing what she intended to do, he did so.
She hereupon grabbed him by the hair, jerked out a knife from behind her
belt, bent him over the hole that she had made, and cut his throat,
letting the blood run into the hole. <span id="fr_97"></span>[1](#fn_95.md)
She then closed up this hole, dug another one somewhat to the north and
dragged the body to it, burying it in this grave.

Hereupon she took the shirt and the beads with her and went home. When
the young man did not return to his home his parents became worried and
inquired at the maiden's house. "We thought you both had gone to our
field to watch," they said. "Do you not know where Kwavû'hú is?" "Yes,"
she said, "we were there together, but he drove me away, and I do not
know where he is." So the parents were very sad. They had killed a sheep
shortly before, but as they were so sorry they ate very little of the
meat, and so the flies came in and ate of the meat. One time the woman
was driving the flies off with a broom and one of them said: "Why do you
drive me away when I eat your meat? I suck some of this meat and then I
shall go and hunt your child." Hereupon the woman desisted and the flies
then sucked of the meat. "Yes," the woman then said to the fly, "our boy
went to watch the fields and he never came back. If you can, you go and
hunt him and find him for me." So the Fly flew away to the corn-field
and found very many tracks. Following them all over the field, she
finally tracked them to the shelter where the young man had been killed.
Flying around here she soon discovered traces of the blood, and opening
the hole she found blood in it. She sucked some of this blood and went a
little farther north and there found the grave. She then sucked up all
the blood from the first opening and injected it into the body and then
waited. Soon the heart of the youth began to beat and after a little
while he raised up, shaking his head slightly. "Have you woke up?" the
Fly said. "Yes," he answered, "but I am very thirsty." "There is some
water over there in the ditch," the Fly said, "go there and drink and
then

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

we shall return to your house." So he went there and quenched his thirst
and then they returned to the house of his parents. These were now very
happy when they saw the child. The Fly then said to the parents: "The
shirt and beads of your boy are at the maiden's house. Let him go over
there and then see what she says, whether she will be glad or not, and
then let him ask for his shirt and beads, and when she gives him the
shirt let him shake it at her, and then when he gets the beads he must
shake them, too."

The mother then said to her son: "All right, you go over to the mána's
house. But the Fly continued: "She will probably spread food before you,
she will offer you piki rolls, but do not eat them." So he went over
there. When the mána saw him she exclaimed: "Ih (with a rising
inflection), Have you come?" "Yes," he said, "I have come." "Sit down,"
she said to him, and at once went into another room and got some food,
which she placed before him. "I am not hungry; I have come for my shirt
and my beads. I think you brought them with you when you came." "Yes, I
have them here, and of course I shall give them to you." She hereupon
went into a room and when she opened the door the young man looked in
and saw that she was very wealthy. She had a great many things there
that she had taken from the youths whom she had killed. When she brought
out his things he took them and shook them at her and said: "Yes, these
are mine, these are the ones." Hereupon he left the house, but the Fly
had in the meanwhile told his parents that they should go over to the
mána's house also and meet their son there, so they met in front of the
house and waited there. While they were standing there they heard a
noise in the house, some clapping and shaking. When the young man had
shaken his shirt and the beads at the mána, an evil charm had entered
her and she was changed into "Tíhkuy Wuhti" <span
id="fr_98"></span>[1](#fn_96) (child protruding woman.md). She entered an
inner room and came out dressed in a white ówa. Her hair was now tied up
like that of a married woman, but her face and clothes were all bloody.
While she had put on this costume the noise and rattle in the room where
the costumes of the slain youths were had continued, and these costumes,
which it seems consisted mostly of buckskins, rabbit skins, etc., had
assumed the shape of deer, antelope and rabbits, and these now dashed
out of the room and left the house. The mána tried to keep them and was
angry, but could not stop them. She grabbed the last one, however, and
wiping her hand over her genitalia

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

she rubbed this hand over the face of the antelope, twisted his nose,
rubbed his horns, etc., and then let him run. She then turned to the
people who had assembled outside of the house and said: "After this you
shall have great difficulty in hunting these animals. If you had let
them alone here they would have remained close by, and you would have
had no difficulty in slaying them." She thereupon also left the house
and disappeared with the game. Ever after she lived along the Little
Colorado River, where also for a long time the deer and antelope
abounded. And this is the reason why it is so difficult to approach and
kill this game. The Tíhkuy Wuhti having rubbed her own odor over the
nose and face of that antelope, these antelopes now smell the odor of
people from a far distance, and so it is very difficult to approach
them. The Tíhkuy Wuhti is said to still live at the Little Colorado
River, and the Hopi claim to have seen her, still wrapped up in the
white robe, and all covered with blood. She controls the game, and
hunters make prayer-offerings to her of turquoise and nakwákwosis
stained in red ochre like that used in the Snake ceremony. These
prayer-offerings, however, are always deposited in the night.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[136:1](toth040.htm#fr_96.md) Told by Wikvaya
(Oraíbi).

<span id="fn_95"></span>[139:1](toth040.htm#fr_97.md) I have found other
evidences in the Hopi tradition that point to the probability that human
sacrifices existed among the ancestors of the Hopi.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[140:1](toth040.htm#fr_98.md) This personage occurs
in various Hopi tales. Some say that in a migrating party a woman was
about to be confined. But as she was in labor a long time, she asked to
be left behind. Her request was granted, the child being only partly
born, from which fact she received her name. Comp. "The Oraíbi Snake
Ceremony," by H, R Voth, page 353.
