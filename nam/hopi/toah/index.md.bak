This is one of the rarest types of ethnographic documents, one actually
written by a native American. Mr. Nequatewa ably relates some of the
mythological stories also covered by [Voth](../toth/index.md). However, the
bulk of this book--by far the most valuable section--covers the
historical legends of the Hopi, from a Hopi viewpoint. The Hopi 'theory'
(Nequatewa's word) was that the 'Bahana' (the white people) emerged from
the under-world alongside the Hopi, and went off in search of the truth.
Someday they would return and live in harmony with the Hopi, bringing
wisdom and great abundance.

So what is the truth of a Hopi? The return of the Bahana didn't work out
quite that way. The Hopi resisted enculturation, sometimes through armed
resistance, at other times through nonviolent resistance (as when they
hide the children from the policeman coming to take them to the boarding
schools). However, all the while they apparently kept their good natured
belief that someday their ironic 'theory' of the inherent goodness of
the whites would work out.

Throughout, Nequatewa relates incidents and characterizations of Hopis
that go far beyond the 'Noble Savage' sterotypes of brave warriors and
laconic wisemen. The Hopi who occupy these pages are all too human, and
that alone is a drop of truth that is missing from accounts of the Hopi,
even to the present day.
