# FOREWORD

The stories related in this little book represent the origin, myths and
history of a group of Hopi clans. They carry us from the very beginning
of things down to modern times. One might say that they are the "Old
Testament" of these people. They tell of their origin, their sacred
beliefs, their wanderings and their trials. The first story is one
recounted only by the Priests of the "One Horned Fraternity" in the
village of Shung-opovi. Edmund Nequatewa, a Shung-opovi man who recorded
this story, is of the Sun Forehead Clan and is a member of the One
Horned Fraternity. Clan stories are not supposed to be told by the
members of unrelated clans but members of the powerful One Horned
Fraternity may tell all the clan stories belonging to the clans of their
village. Each society has its own group of stories and sacred songs
which it may give, but no other society is supposed to know these or to
relate them.

The clans concerned in this particular story are the following: the Bear
Clan, *Hona-wungwa*; the Strap Clan, *Bia-quois-wungwa*; the Blue Bird
Clan, *Chosh-wungwa*; the Spider Clan, *Koking-wungwa*; the Gopher Clan
(extinct), *Mui-wungwa*; and the "Greasy Eye Cavities of the Skull
Clan," *Wikurs-wungwa* (now extinct). Other clan stories are included in
this book.

The Crow, *Ungwish-wungwa*, or Kachina Clan story is closely connected
with the first story, the "Truth of a Hopi," and their later history
forms a part of our tale. These people came to the Hopi towns after the
arrival of the Strap Clan and the Parrot Clan, Gash-wungwa (Zuni Clan
from Awatovi).

The Legend of Palotquopi is the story of the Cloud or Water Clan group;
these were the last to arrive. Several of these clans are mentioned in
our main story. The Cloud, *Omow-wungwa*, or Water Clan (nicknamed Flood
Clan) was originally the Corn Clan, *Ka-eu-wungwa*. After the disaster
at Palotquopi this clan split and three others were formed, the Snow
Clan, *Nuva-wungwa*, the Wilted Corn Clan, *Pikas-wungwa*, and the
Rabbit Bush Clan, *Sivaf-wungwa* (now extinct). With these clans came
the Eagle Clan, *Qua-wungwa*, the Tobacco Clan, *Bif-wungwa*, the Rabbit
Clan, *Taf-wungwa*, the Sand Clan, *Teu-wungwa*, the Bamboo or Reed
Clan, *Wuko-bacab-wungwa*, the Sun Forehead Clan, *Kala-wungwa*,
originally the Eagle Clan, and the Sun Clan, *Tawa-wungwa*. When this
group arrived, the

\[paragraph continues\] Crow Clan was already settled at Mishongnovi by
the Corn Rock.

The clans mentioned above, with which the three stories deal, represent
all the clans in the village of Shung-opovi, with the exception of the
following group: Badger Clan, *Honan-wungwa*, Butterfly Clan,
*Poval-wungwa*, Tansy Mustard Clan, *As-wungwa*, and the Parrot Clan,
*Gash-wungwa*, said to be a Zuni Clan. These clans came from Awatovi,
after the destruction of that village.

As the North American Indian never developed a written language, all
traditions are passed down by "word of mouth." Boys were initiated into
the sacred societies when they reached early maturity, and were then
taught the traditions and history of their people. Since the intrusion
of the White Man and the development of his school system, there has
been a consequent breaking down of the ancient customs. Although the
young men are still initiated into the societies, it is usually at a
much later period and often even after marriage. The old men complain of
the careless inattention of the younger generation and are fearful that
their history and traditions may fall into confusion and be forever lost
to the coming generations. And so, today we find many of the more
thoughtful men anxious to have these precious records permanently
recorded in writing.

In the following pages the author's style remains practically unchanged,
only slight alterations having been made here and there by the editor
for the sake of clarifying the meaning. Historic events have been
checked by the editor and many explanatory foot-notes added.

The author and the editor are greatly indebted to Dr. Harold S. Colton,
Miss Katharine Bartlett, Mr. Lyndon Hargrave, and various Hopi
informants for their kind cooperation and assistance in compiling this
little book.
