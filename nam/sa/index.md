| **Native South Americans** |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This index has links to resources at Intangible Textual Heritage about
the religions and spiritual practices of Native South Americans
exclusive of the Incas. Please note that while South America is a vast
land with a great diversity of environments and cultures, the same
cannot be said for the material available in the public domain which is
written in English; thus all of the culture areas (except the Andean
region) will be lumped together here. At this time, however, only
British Guiana (now known as Guyana) is represented.
