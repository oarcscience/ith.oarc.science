## C<span class="small">HAPTER</span> XII THE SPIRITS OF THE WATER

   <span class="small">Names and general appearance: Anthropomorphic
(*[177](#pp_177)*); partly human, partly animal (*[178](#pp_178)*.md);
Zoomorphic, as porpoise, manati, macaw (*[179](#pp_179)*.md), snake
(*[180](#pp_180)*), big fish, Omar (*[181](#pp_181)-182*.md); derived from
men or animals (*[183](#pp_183)*.md); kindly disposed on the whole—they
gave man his water-jug and potato (*[184](#pp_184)*.md), the rattle and
tobacco (*[185](#pp_185)*.md); of an amorous disposition
(*[186](#pp_186)-187*.md), with strong likings for menstruating women
(*[188](#pp_188)-189*.md); share, with Bush Spirits, the responsibility for
sickness, accident, and death (*[190](#pp_190)*.md); responsible also for
the Tidal Wave (*[191](#pp_191)*.md); they object to mention of their names
and antecedents (*[192](#pp_192)*.md); to a pot-spoon being washed outside
the traveling boat (*[193](#pp_193)*.md); and woe betide the yoyager if he
dares to utter certain forbidden words (*[194](#pp_194)*.md).</span>

   <span id="pp_177"></span>**177.**[\*](#pp_177.md) The Water Spirits,
whether anthropomorphic or zoomorphic, are known as Ori-yu or Orehu
(Arawak), Ho-aránni (Warrau), Oko-yumo (Carib), etc. The Warraus,
especially a swamp-inhabiting tribe, seem to have made several
distinctions in their Spirits: they had their Ahúba, Ho-inarau or
Ho-aránni, and Naba-rau or Naba-ranni. The Ahúba is the "Fish-mamma,"
the chief of all the fish—one male and one female. The two live in
underground water; their heads are like those of people, but their
bodies resemble those of fish though they are provided with all the
different kinds of feet belonging to land animals. They work evil on
mankind; when shipwreck takes place they eat the bodies. The Ho-inarau
and Naba-rau represent the Water Spirits of the sea and the rivers,
respectively; they are sometimes like people, sometimes like fish, and
were once good and kind, but the Warraus have made them bad. Indeed,
there was a time when these Water People used to live in amity and
friendship with the Land People. There are two reasons for the
termination of this ideal state of existence. The Warraus used to
exchange wives with them in those days, that is, a wife would be taken
as required alternately from the one and the other tribe (see [Sect.
*190*](aflg12.htm#pp_190).md). The Warrau supply ran short, however, and
the Water Spirits accordingly became vexed and angered with them. The
second alleged reason is that the Warraus insisted on the isolation of
the women at their menstrual periods, a practice to which the Water
Spirits were unaccustomed and strongly objected ([Sect.
*190*](aflg12.htm#pp_190).md).

   Though some of the Water Spirits have been repeatedly described by
certain authors as the Water-mamma, they have nothing whatever to do
with the African-Creole superstition represented under that designation.
Still less have they necessarily any connection with the water-cow or
manati (the Kuyu-moro of the Arawaks), or with the water-camudi (the
*madre del agua* of the old Spanish authors), <span id="page_242">p.
242</span> except of course in the possibility that the physical
attributes and peculiarities of these and other huge creatures have had
to be accounted for in the Indian cosmogony. The natives of the Amazons
country have their *mai d'agoa*—Mother or Spirit of the Water—the shape
of a water serpent said to be many score fathoms in length, a monster
doubtless suggested by the occasional appearance of the anaconda
(*Eunectes murinus*), which assumes a great variety forms (HWB, 236).
One of the many mysterious tales told of the Bouto, as the large dolphin
of the Amazons is called, "was to the effect that a Bouto once had the
habit of assuming the shape of a beautiful woman, with hair hanging
loose to her heels, and walking ashore at night in the streets of Ega to
entice the young men down to the water. If anyone was so much smitten as
to follow her to the water-side, she grasped her victim round the waist
and plunged beneath the waves with a triumphant cry" (HWB, 309).

   The accounts of these Water Folk vary a great deal, but I believe the
following represents the consensus of Arawak opinion. The Oriyus always
live in the water and one at least accompanies every corial. If an
accident takes place the Spirit is blamed for it. These Spirits may
appear in human shape, impersonating both sexes. The female sometimes
can be seen bathing on the banks of a stream, or combing her long hair
with a silver comb, which she occasionally forgets and leaves behind in
her hurry to return to the water when suddenly surprised.

   <span id="pp_178"></span>**178.**[\*](#pp_178.md) Oriyu sometimes
splashes and tramples the water like a horse where horses are known not
to exist; Brett even goes so far as to tell us that "she sometimes
presents herself above the water with the head of a horse or other
animal as it may suit her fancy, or the object she has in view" (Br,
367). On the other hand, I have often heard her or him described by
Warraus as having a fish's head. Brett as a matter of fact always speaks
of Oriyu as a female. Of remaining Water People those mentioned by im
Thurn as the Huroni (cf. the Warrau term Ho-aránni, Water Spirits in
general), "a tribe of Indians living beyond the Pakaraima \[mountains\],
who are men by night, but fish by day," etc. (IT, 384), will doubtless
remind the reader strongly of the Huri Fish story ([Sect.
*152*](aflg09.htm#pp_152).md). People may actually be transformed into fish
([Sect. *115*](aflg08.htm#pp_115).md). The Piapocos of the lower Guaviar, a
branch of the Orinoco, have a belief in Evil Spirits who live by day at
the bottom of the water, but emerge at night, when they walk about,
screaming like little children: they call these Spirits Mami-naïmis, and
consider that the various rock-carvings are their handiwork (Cr, 525,
529). Endowed with somewhat similar habits there must be included here
the Water People mentioned by Brown (Bro, 247), who apparently received
his information from the Tarumas of the upper Essequibo, and by Crévaux
(274) who derived <span id="page_243">p. 243</span> his from the Indians
of the upper Parou, in the far eastern Guianas. The former tells us that
the Toonahyannas, or Water People, are said to live more to the south,
near the headwaters of the Trombetas River (in Brazil). These have ponds
encircled by stockades, to which they retire for the night, sleeping
with their bodies submerged. The latter authority states that "on a
march of four days to the westward, we would meet some very bad Indians
whom it would be impossible to take by surprise because they plunged in
a stream called by the same name (Parou) as that which we were now on. .
. . Let us note in passing that *toona* signifies 'water' not only
amongst the Taruma, but also in the language of the Trios, Roucouyennes,
Apaläi, Carijonas: the Caribs of the Antilles call water *toné*."
Perhaps these Water People were undergoing a gradual transformation
before reaching the final change with advancing European civilization,
after the style of the Partamonas at Waipah village on the Ireng, who
stated that it was currently reported among the surrounding inhabitants
that now that a white man had come among them, their country would sink
under water (Bro, 283).

   <span id="pp_179"></span>**179.**[\*](#pp_179.md) When zoomorphic the
Water Spirit may take on the form of a porpoise, manati ([Sect.
*183*](aflg12.htm#pp_183).md), macaw, snake, or fish. Thus, the Pomeroon
Arawaks believe in the kassi-kuyuha, a white or a black variety of
porpoise: the latter will hunt and injure a person who happens to fall
into the water, whereas the white species will save one from drowning
and carry him to shore. All that one has to do is to jump on the
Spirit's back—it will do the rest and will always help anyone who is not
afraid of it. Caroquia, on the Demerara River, is a place avoided by the
Indians: Water-mámmas in this place take the form of huge scarlet
macaws, which rise out of the river and drag them beneath the water,
woodskins and all (Ki, 179). On the Moruca River an old Warrau piai
friend of mine told me that it is the macaw who tells the Ho-aránni to
come and upset the canoe, as well as to destroy the occupants: the bird
itself may also assist directly in the work of destruction.

   <span id="pp_180"></span>**180.**[\*](#pp_180.md) The Caribs talk of
their Okoyumo being like a camudi snake, but much bigger; it lives in
underground water: in habitat, it corresponds closely to the variety of
Water Spirit which the Warraus call Ahúba. In cases of snake-bite among
certain tribes, in addition to any other treatment the bitten person
must neither drink water, bathe, nor come into the neighborhood of
water, during the period immediately following the accident \[cf. [Sect.
*317*](aflg17.htm#pp_317.md)\]: the same prohibition, for a similar period,
is incumbent on his children, his parents, and his brothers and sisters
so long as they reside in the same settlement. His wife alone is free
from the taboo (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 130). The freedom of
the woman from such an inconvenience is interesting when regarded in
conjunction with the belief in human milk as an efficacious antidote for
snake-poison.

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

   <span id="pp_181"></span>**181.**[\*](#pp_181.md) Of Water Spirits in
the form of fish I must note the Omars, of which, so far as the name is
concerned, the only record I can find is given by im Thurn. These are
beings—

>    With bodies variously described as like those of exaggerated crabs
> and fish, who live under water in the rapids, and often drag down the
> boats of the Indians as they shoot these places. . . . A story was
> told me at Ouropocari fall on the Essequibo. . . . This Omar used to
> feed on rotten wood, and he dragged down many boats merely in mistake
> for floating logs, but all the same the Indians were drowned. So one
> day an Ackawoi peaiman carefully wrapped up two pieces of the wood
> with which fire is rubbed, so that no water could make them damp. Then
> he dived down into the middle of the falls, and got into the belly of
> the Omar. There he found whole stores of rotten wood. So he set fire
> to this. Then the Omar, in great pain, rose to the surface, belched
> out the peaiman and died. \[IT, 385.\]

I do not know whether this author was aware that *omar* is the Arawak
term for that terrible little fish, the pirai, whose peculiarly
destructive powers would constitute a capital groundwork on which to
weave fabulous embellishment, though there is a suspicion that the word
is but a play on the word Jonah, the exploits of these extraordinary
individuals being so closely parallel.

   <span id="pp_182"></span>**182.**[\*](#pp_182.md) I obtained a somewhat
similar story from the Warraus of the Moruca River.

   <span id="pp_183"></span>**183.**[\*](#pp_183.md) Some of these Water
Spirits have been derived from human mortals as well as from animals.

   Others again may claim genealogical relations with a totally
different beast. On the left bank of the Pomeroon, just above the mouth
of Wakapoa Creek, is a place where the water used to be generally "on
the bubble": this is believed to be the spot where some gigantic
Salapentas (lizards) after being vanquished by the Indians threw
themselves into the river and became Oriyus.

   <span id="pp_184"></span>**184.**[\*](#pp_184.md) Certain of the Water
Spirits are of a kindly nature, in the sense of having conferred gifts
and blessings on mankind ([Sect. *185*](aflg12.htm#pp_185).md), in saving
men from drowning ([Sect. *179*](aflg12.htm#pp_179).md), and in other ways.

> potatoes.

   <span id="pp_185"></span>**185.**[\*](#pp_185.md) Brett mentions certain
other good qualities of the Oriyus. Out on one of the islands all the
men, women, and children were struck down with sickness. Arawánili \[cf.
Hariwali, [Sect. *3*](aflg02.htm#pp_3.md)\], the island chieftain, begged
Oriyu for some charm to withstand the Evil Spirit's power which had made
his people sick. She gave him the branch of an Ida tree, which she told
him to go and plant, and to bring back to her the first fruit that
should fall from it. This turned out to be a calabash (*Crescentia*),
with which he did what he was told. Having emptied the rind through
certain holes cut in in it, she provided him with the feathered handle,
and dived into the sea whence she brought the shining white stones to
put into it; with these she thereupon showed him how to invoke the
Spirits. Thus was the first *maraka* (rattle) formed. Besides this, she
taught Arawánili the use of tobacco, till then unknown to man ([BrB,
18](../lmbg/lmbg1b.htm#page_18).md).

   <span id="pp_186"></span>**186.**[\*](#pp_186.md) Like the Spirits of
the Forest, the Oriyus have strong sexual predilections. Every night, in
their anthropomorphic form, both males and females may come after
Indians of the opposite sex respectively, and no disastrous result
follows the intimacy.<span
id="page_246_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_246_note_1.md) But the Indians who
happen to have such dealings must keep the fact absolutely secret: if
divulged, either they will not live long, or they <span id="page_247">p.
247</span> will never be visited again by their Spirit friends.
Furthermore, those Indians who foster such friendships must on no
account have similar dealing with their own people.<span
id="page_247_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_247_note_1.md) Perhaps it is as a
result of these sexual weaknesses of the Spirits that some of the
Arawaks believe in the possibility of an Oriyu introducing into the womb
a full-term fetus, provided the woman really wants to be pregnant
([Sect. *284A*](aflg16.htm#pp_284A)..md)—a real water-baby.

have great liking for women at the menstrual period, so much so that, at
such a time, no Carib, Akawai, Warrau, or Arawak woman will travel by
boat or even cross water.

   <span id="pp_191"></span>**191.**[\*](#pp_191.md) Not only are many of
the troubles afflicting mankind, as just recorded in the legend,
ascribable to the machinations of Oriyu, but he (or she) is held
responsible for more than one natural phenomenon. The tidal wave, or
bore, known as *appapuru* \[an Arawak term\] on the Berbice and other
streams, in certain of this colony's rivers is a case in point. Among
the natives the popular explanation is that when this River becomes
inconveniently low for the bad things of the deep, they show their
uneasiness by moving furiously about, and thus agitate the river (Da,
21). The several tribes on the coast, we learn from Doctor Hancock,
usually give it some name, signifying "head of waters" or "mother of
waters," and in connection with this have many strange stories to tell
of the Loku-kuyuha (people's spirit) mermaid, or "watery mamma" as they
translate it (ScC, 288). Again, Wailak-paru, a creek on the right bank
of the Potaro, is so called from a part of the human body, and is
believed to be the home of Oriyu: the turbulence of the water as it runs
into the Potaro is caused by water issuing from the body of that Spirit.

   <span id="pp_193"></span>**193.**[\*](#pp_193.md) Besides their dislike
to hearing mention of their names and antecedents, as well as their
passion for menstruating women, it is interesting to note the strong
objection of the Water Spirits to a pot-spoon being washed outside of
the traveling boat in either river or sea ([Sects.
*214*](aflg13.htm#pp_214), [*219*](aflg13.htm#pp_219).md).

   <span id="pp_194"></span>**194.**[\*](#pp_194.md) The surest way of
offending the Water Spirits, however, and thereby getting caught in a
storm, and being capsized, wrecked, or drowned by way of punishment, is
to utter certain words strictry forbidden under the circumstances. Thus,
among the Arawaks of the Pomeroon and Moruca Rivers, there are certain
terms which must never be employed when on a boat: they have to be
paraphrased. The majority of these tabooed words are evidently of
foreign (mostly Spanish) origin: a few are certainly indigenous. Thus,
the occupants of a corial will never be heard to use the term *arcabuza*
(gun), but they will speak of a gun as *kataroro* (foot, referring to
the stock); they talk of *kariro* (the one with the teeth) instead of
*perro* (Span., dog); of *kanakara-shiro* (load on the head, the cock's
comb) instead of *gai-ina* (Span., *gallina*, fowl); of *akwadoa-kotiro*
(round foot) instead of *kawai-yo* (Span., *caballo*, horse); of
*kakwaro* (horn) instead of *bakka* (Span., *vaca*, cow); of *tataro*
(something hard) instead of *sereri* (grindstone, or saw, probably from
Span. *sierra*); of *majeriki* (the untrimmed one, referring to the
hair) instead of *hó-a* (monkey); of *ehedoa* (frothing, brimming over,
in reference to its snarling or growling) instead of *aroa* (tiger); of
*katau-chi* (the one with wisdom) instead of *semi-chichi*
(meclicine-man), etc. The Warraus, it seems, had also various words
strictly taboo when traveling by boat. The same holds good for Cayenne,
where the superstitious Indians take care not to speak of several things
by their right names: <span id="page_253">p. 253</span> thus, if one has
to speak of a rock, it must be described as "that which is hard;" if it
is a lizard, they must similarly paraphrase by saying "that which has a
long tail." It is dangerous also to name the streams and little islands
that they pass en route. Even the medicine-men may not be mentioned as
such: infringement of this rule will cause at least rain to fall,
without reckoning that one is exposed to shipwreck, together with the
likelihood of some frightful monster rising from out the deep, and
swallowing the whole lot (PBa, 184). Records have been left to us of
similar practices by the Carib islanders. When they have to cross the
sea . . . upon approaching land, this must not be named or pointed out,
but it can be noticed by shouting *Lyca!* "It is there!" (BBR, 245).

curious phase of Indian character: Celibacy in either sex is regarded as
something uncanny or unnatural. It is on this account that two very

intimate relations with the Oriyu.

is the little out-house for the special use of women at their periods,
and sometimes for the use of a female during confinement. It can always
be distinguished by the tassels of "skinned" Mauritia leaves (those from
which the cortex has been removed for twine manufacture), hanging from
the posts and other parts. This building is of course taboo to the
males, though I am afraid that advantage is often taken by bachelor
friends of this isolation of the females from their husbands.—W. E. R.
