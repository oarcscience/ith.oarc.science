## C<span class="small">HAPTER</span> III TRACES OF SPIRIT, IDOL, AND FETISH CULT

   <span class="small">Evidence very scarce, but recognizable in
Familiar Spirits, and in the kickshaws of the Medicine-man
(*[43](#pp_43)*); Dancing with noisy instruments in front of Idols
(*[44](#pp_44)*); the Sacred Trumpets or Flutes (*[45](#pp_45)*); Frogs
and Toads as divinities (*[46](#pp_46)*); Snakes (*[47](#pp_47)*). On
the Amazons: Idols (*[48](#pp_48)*); Other objects, of obscure
signification, recorded from within (*[49](#pp_49)*) and without
(*[50](#pp_50)*) the Guianas, can hardly be regarded as Idols or
Fetishes.</span>

   <span id="pp_43"></span>**43.**[\*](#pp_43) It must be admitted that
the positive evidence of idol or fetish worship among the Guiana Indians
is very scarce, even Schomburgk recording (ScR, <span
class="small">II</span>, 321) that he never found the slightest trace of
idolatry or of supplication to a fetish. And yet, in view of the
historical records that the people living to the north, the west, and
the south of them, did certainly have something akin to an idol or
fetish cult leads one to the belief that the Guiana natives, at some not
very remote period of their history, may possibly have pursued similar
practices. Their northern neighbors, living on the islands, apparently
worshiped *Cemi*, or so-called familiar spirits, a cult still traceable,
as I propose showing ([Sect. *93*](aflg07.htm#pp_93)), in certain
kickshaws of the mainland medicine-man.

   <span id="pp_44"></span>**44.**[\*](#pp_44) Among their western
tribesmen a religious rite performed by some of the Orinoco tribes "was
that of dancing to the sound of very noisy instruments, before two small
idols, to which they paid reverence by chanting extemporaneous couplets"
(FD, 52).

   <span id="pp_45"></span>**45.**[\*](#pp_45) This reference to noisy
instruments suggests the sacred trumpet, or *botuto*, which was an
object of veneration on the upper reaches of the Orinoco, the Atabapo,
and the Inirida. It was sounded under the palm trees that they might
bear abundance of fruit. Humboldt says that, to be initiated into the
mysteries of the *botuto*, it is requisite to be of pure morals and to
have lived single. The initiated are subjected to flagellations,
fastings, and other painful exercises. There is but a small number of
these sacred trumpets. The most anciently celebrated is that upon a hill
near the confluence of the Tomo and the Guainia. Father Cereso assured
us, continues the celebrated traveler, that the Indians speak of the
Botuto of Tomo as an object of worship common to many surrounding
tribes. Fruit and intoxicating liquor are placed beside the sacred
trumpet. Sometimes the Great Spirit himself makes the botuto resound;
sometimes he is content to manifest his will through him to whom the
keeping of the instrument is entrusted. "Women are not permitted to see
this marvelous instrument, and are excluded from all the ceremonies of
this worship" (AVH, <span class="small">II</span>, 363), at the risk of
life.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

   Wallace (348) also refers to similar instruments among the Uapes
River Indians, upper Rio Negro, which are used at their festivals to
produce the Jurupari, or Forest-Spirit, music. He says that—

>    These instruments, however, are with them such a mystery that no
> woman must ever see them, on pain of death. They are always kept in
> some *igaripe´* \[water-chanel\] at a distance from the malocca,
> whence they are brought on particular occasions: when the sound of
> them is heard approaching, every woman retires into the woods, or into
> some adjoining shed which they generally have near, and remains
> invisible till after the ceremony is over, when the instruments are
> taken away to their hiding-place, and the women come out of their
> concealment. Should any female be supposed to have seen them, either
> by accident or design, she is invariably executed, generally by
> poison, and a father will not hesitate to sacrifice his daughter, or a
> husband his wife, on such an occasion.

   Koch-Grünberg (<span class="small">I</span>, 186-187) speaks of these
"Devil" flutes on the Aiary River (Rio Negro) among the Siusi, an Arawak
tribe. He says that these are sounded in honor of Ko-ai, the son of
Yaperi´kuli, their tribal Hero; that the festival at which they are used
is held at the time of ripening of the fruit of the manicole (*Euterpe
oleracea*) and turu (*Œnocarpus bacaba*); that on the same occasion
there is mutual flagellation with whips. The flutes have to be carefully
guarded from the gaze of women, and when not in use are hidden under
water, etc. They take their name from that of the spirit in whose honor
they are sounded. Elsewhere (KG, <span class="small">I</span>, 314-316)
he speaks of the dance as having magic powers; it can dispel sickness
and even heal big wounds. Granted that the whipping is part and parcel
of the festival, and the object of the festival is to ensure abundance
of fruit, the following extract from Gumilla is worth consideration:
When the time arrives for clearing the open plains with a view to sowing
their corn, yucca, plantains, etc., they \[the Salivas\] place the young
men, some separated from the others, in lines, and a certain number of
old men provide themselves with whips and rough thongs made of twisted
agave (*pita*). As soon as intimation is given that it is time to
commence work, the whipping of these young men takes place, and
notwithstanding the cuts and marks which their bodies receive, neither
groan nor complaint escapes them (G, <span class="small">I</span>, 188).
It is true that the missionary was told that they received the whipping
to cure them of their laziness, but I am strongly inclined to the view,
corroborated as it is by the examples already given, that flagellation
is a propitiation for favors already received or expected, that the
object of the whole festival in fact is comparable with that met with in
connection with the cassava plant ([Sects. 165](aflg10.htm#pp_165),
[166](aflg10.htm#pp_166)). The flagellations inflicted at the burial
ceremonies ([Sect. *75*](aflg05.htm#pp_75)) would seem to have a
different origin.

   <span id="pp_46"></span>**46.**[\*](#pp_46) "Some other tribes of
Indians, who likewise dwelt upon the banks of the river Oronoka, paid to
toads the honours due to the divinity \[[Sect.
*342*](aflg19.htm#pp_342)\]. Far from injuring these animals, they
carefully <span id="page_139">p. 139</span> kept them under pots, in
order to obtain rain or fine weather; and so fully persuaded were they
of their power in this respect, that they scourged them as often as
their petitions were not answered." (FD, 52.) It is known that for the
Chaimas, Cumanagotos, Tamanacs, and other original tribes of the Caribs,
the frog was the god of the waters (cf. [Sect. *18*](aflg02.htm#pp_18)):
Ruiz Blanco (*Conversion de Piritu*) says that the Cumanagotos never
killed a frog, but kept one like a domestic animal, beating it when the
rain did not fall (AR, 185). There is an intimate connection between
frogs, toads, and certain other animals, and success in the chase
([Sect. *349*](aflg19.htm#pp_349)).

   <span id="pp_47"></span>**47.**[\*](#pp_47) Beyond the mention of
certain snake dances, I can find nothing akin to actual worship and
similar ceremonies in connection with these creatures, notwithstanding
the very deep-rooted belief in the relationship of the serpent to sexual
matters ([Sect. *347*](aflg19.htm#pp_347)). At Maroa, River Guainia,
(upper Rio Negro), Humboldt (<span class="small">II</span>, 386) talks
of "that ancient *dance of serpents*, the *Queti*, in which these wily
animals are represented as issuing from the forests, and coming to drink
with the men in order to deceive them, and carry off the women." So also
Wallace (204) records in connection with a snake dance among the Uaupes
River Indians, participated in by men and boys, "two huge artificial
snakes of twigs and bushes bound together with sipós, from thirty to
forty feet long, and about a foot in diameter. . . . They divided
themselves into two parties of twelve or fifteen each, and lifting the
snakes on their shoulders, began dancing."

   <span id="pp_48"></span>**48.**[\*](#pp_48) South of the Guianas,
there is the evidence of Acuña (92) from the Amazons, in 1639:

>    The Religion of these barbarous People is much alike: they all
> worship Idols which they make with their own hands; to one of them
> they ascribe the authority of governing the waters, and put a fish in
> his hand in token of his power; they choose others to preside over
> their seed time, and others to inspire them with courage in their
> Battles; they say these gods came down from Heaven on purpose to dwell
> with them and to show them kindness. They do not signify their
> Adoration of these Idols by any outward ceremonies, but on the
> contrary seem to have forgotten them as soon as they have made them,
> and putting them in a case let them lie, without taking any notice of
> them so long as they imagine they have no occasion for their Help; but
> when they are ready to march out to war, they set up the Idol in which
> they have placed the hopes of their Victories, at the Prow of their
> Canoes (Cf. [Sect. *84*](aflg05.htm#pp_84)): so, when they go a
> fishing, they take that Idol with them to which they attribute the
> government of the waters.

   <span id="pp_49"></span>**49.**[\*](#pp_49) On the other hand, there
are a few accounts of the existence of various cult objects, the actual
signification of which has so far not been satisfactorily explained;
lest these should ever be claimed as examples of a fetish cult, it would
be well to mention them here. In the Catalogue of Contributions
transmitted from British Guiana to the London International Exhibition
of 1862 there is a record (p. 52) of "Figures of Clay, made by an Indian
of the Caribisi tribe, <span id="page_140">p. 140</span> and
representing human beings and an armadillo. From Massaruni River.
Contributed by H. C. Whitlock and Geo. Dennis. These are the only
specimens of Indian plastic art ever seen by the Contributors." I myself
have obtained children's whistles in the shape of frogs and turtles made
of clay by the Moruca River Caribs. Among the Caribs of the Parou River,
French Guiana, Crévaux (262) speaks of meeting with a young woman who
was modeling a tapir in black wax. From the upper Aiary (Rio Negro)
Koch-Grünberg (<span class="small">I</span>, 125) figures several wax
objects modeled by little boys, and wooden fishes employed in the death
ceremonies (KG, <span class="small">II</span>, 154). In our own colony,
Schomburgk states (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 471) that at a
Maopityan settlement under the cone-shaped shelter raised on top of the
giant huts, were several flat pieces of wood, cut into all kinds of
figures, which swayed to and fro with the wind. Among the Monikos and
Sokorikos, branches of the Carib race inhabiting the districts on both
sides of the Cotinga, "a very marked feature in all their houses," says
J. J. Quelch (Ti, 1895, pp. 144-5), "are the rude imitations birds,
chiefly of the herons, the negrocop \[*Mycteria*\], the muscovy duck,
and the swallow-tailed hawk, which are made from cotton thread,
corn-cobs and sticks, and are suspended high up under the roofs of the
houses, in the positions occupied during flight." These are probably
identical with the targets met with on the Aiary River (Rio Negro).
Targets of artificial birds, made of maize-cobs and their coverings,
hang as decorations from the crossbeams of the houses: the boys blow at
them with nonpoisoned arrows (KG, <span class="small">I</span>, 102;
<span class="small">II</span>, 244).

   <span id="pp_50"></span>**50.**[\*](#pp_50) Outside of the Guianas to
the westward, among the Carijonas of the upper Yapura, Crévaux (361)
speaks of a bench with rough carvings representing a bird of prey; also
of the wooden figure of a man with legs wide apart. To the southward,
Acuña (142) makes mention of the Capunas and Zurinas on the south side
of the Amazon, near its junction with the Rio Negro:

>    They will cut a raised figure so much to the life and so exactly
> upon any coarse piece of wood that many of our Carvers might take
> pattern by them. It is not only to gratify their own fancies, and for
> their own use that they make these pieces of work, but also for the
> Profit it brings them: for they hereby maintain a trade with their
> neighbours, and truck their work with them for any necessaries to
> serve their occasion.
