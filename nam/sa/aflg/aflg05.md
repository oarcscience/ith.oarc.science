## C<span class="small">HAPTER</span> V THE BODY AND ITS ASSOCIATED SPIRITS

   <span class="small">The Body: Originally considered immortal
(*[63](#pp_63)*); renovated by change of skin (*[64](#pp_64)*), or by
Fountain of Youth (*[65](#pp_65)*); its immortality put to the test
(*[66](#pp_66)*), and assured by its transformation into stone
(*[67](#pp_67)*).  
   The Spirits: Several in each body; Shadow Spirits; Head, Heart, and
Pulse-beat, Blood, Spittle, Footprint, and Bone Spirits, possessed by
both men (*[68](#pp_68)-69*) and animals (*[70](#pp_70)*): become
associated with Dream, Familiar, Forest, Mountain, Sky, and Water,
Spirits (*[71](#pp_71)*).  
   Stages in Conception of Spirit Immortality shown in disposal and
treatment of corpse: attitude in which buried, etc. (*[72](#pp_72)*);
flattery and adulation, festivals and feasts (*[73](#pp_73)-74*);
furnishing dead with means of capturing assailant (*[75](#pp_75)*);
supplying dead with dogs, women, ornaments, hunting and fighting
weapons, and food (*[76](#pp_76)*); eating his flesh and bones
(*[77](#pp_77)*); exhuming his remains for witchcraft and prophecy
(*[78](#pp_78)*); abandonment of place of sepulture, etc.
(*[79](#pp_79)*); doubtful animistic indications of other burial customs
(*[80](#pp_80)*).  
   Where spirits take on anthropomorphic forms, they reach their final
destination direct (*[81](#pp_81)*) or only after certain trials and
ordeals (*[82](#pp_82)*), but the idea of a future existence dependent
on present conduct is very probably a borrowed one (*[83](#pp_83)*).  
   Spirits are Good or Bad according as they help or harm the Indian,
and *not* according to the bodies whence they have been derived; the
latter conception is an error into which many missionaries and travelers
have fallen—*e. g.*, the Maboya Spirit (*[84](#pp_84)*).  
   Individuals can be relieved of the presence of undesirable Spirits by
use of rattle, by blowing (*[85](#pp_85)*).</span>

   <span id="pp_63"></span>**63.**[\*](#pp_63) As with many another
savage people, there are traces among the Guiana Indians of an idea of
perpetual existence of both body and its contained spirits. On the upper
Yary River, Cayenne, when a Roucouyenne piai is buried, the flesh
(*matière*) and spirit remain in the grave, to be visited by
medicine-men and others, as well as by beasts, for the purpose of being
consulted (Cr, 298). The following is a curious case from Surinam
reported by de Goeje (22): "An Ojana woman asked me, when I came again,
to bring her a teremopüilatop which literally means 'die-never
implement-for,' so that her little son might be blessed with everlasting
life. When I told her there was no such thing, and that everybody had to
die, I met with the same extraordinary unbelief that Von den Steinen
records in his 'Unter den Naturvölkern' (p. 348)." So also on the upper
Rio Negro Koch-Grünberg (<span class="small">I</span>, 197) was applied
to for a panacea (*Universalsmittel*) against death.

   <span id="pp_64"></span>**64.**[\*](#pp_64) Other phases of this idea
of an immortal body are met with in the myths relative to changed skins:
the Indian belief is that those creatures which undergo ecdysis live
forever. After Amalivaca had lived a long while with the Tamanacas, he
took his corial to reach the other side of the salt water whence he had
come. Just as he was taking his departure he sang out to them, "You will
change your <span id="page_150">p. 150</span> skins," (*i. e.*, "You
will always be young," like snakes, etc.), but one doubting old dame
called out "Oh!" which annoyed Amalivaca so much that he now said "You
shall die!" (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 320). When Kururumanni
\[Kororomanna\] came to earth to see what the Arawaks were doing, he
found them so bad that he wished to destroy them, on which account he
took away their everlasting life and bestowed it on those creatures who
cast their skins—snakes, lizard and cockroaches (ScR, <span
class="small">II</span>, 319).

   <span id="pp_64A"></span>**64A.**[\*](#pp_64A) There are several
examples of this taking-off and putting-on of skins and consequent
continuous existence, to be met with in the Guiana folk-lore (*e. g.*,
[Sects. *64B*](aflg05.htm#pp_64B), [*137*](aflg09.htm#pp_137),
[*162*](aflg09.htm#pp_162)), therefore I can only conclude that all of
these are stages in the conception of the same idea of living forever.

   <span id="pp_64B"></span>**64B.**[\*](#pp_64B) Another example is to
be met in the story which I am adapting here from Brett ([BrB,
177](../lmbg/lmbg5b.htm#page_177)).

 

<span id="story_12"></span>[\*](#story_12)T<span class="small">HE</span>
S<span class="small">ORCERER'S</span> D<span
class="small">AUGHTER</span>

>    The daughter of a piai fell in love with a brave young hunter, who
> did not seemingly pay her any too much attention. She begged her
> father to make her like one of the young man's dogs so that she might
> always be with him. He put a magic skin over her shoulders and she

   <span id="pp_65"></span>**65.**[\*](#pp_65) It was owing to a myth
relative to the fountain of perennial youth that Florida came to be
discovered just four centuries ago. Some old Island Indians, presumably
of the Arawak stock, assured Ponce de Leon that—

>    Far to the north there existed a land abounding in gold and in all
> manner of delights; but above all, possessing a river of such
> wonderful virtue that whoever bathed in it would be restored to youth!
> They added, that in times past, before the arrival of the Spaniards, a
> large party of the natives of Cuba had departed northward in search of
> this happy land and this River of Life, and, having never returned, it
> was concluded that they were flourishing in renovated youth, detained
> by the pleasure of that enchanting country. \[WI, 788.\]

   <span id="pp_66"></span>**66.**[\*](#pp_66) Another interesting
example of the existence of this idea of immortality is connected with
the Arawak stock in Porto Rico:

>    Many of the most hardy and daring (of the Indians) proposed a
> general insurrection, and a massacre of their oppressors; the great
> mass, however, were deterred by the belief that the Spaniards were
> Supernatural Beings and could not be killed. A shrewd and sceptical
> cacique, named Brayoan, determined to put their immortality to the
> test. Hearing that a young Spaniard named Salzedo was passing through
> his lands, he sent a party of his subjects to escort him, giving them
> secret instructions how they were to act. On coming to a river, they
> took Salzedo on their shoulders to carry him across, but, when in the
> midst of the stream, they let him fall and throwing themselves upon
> him, pressed him under water until he was drowned. Then dragging his
> body to the shore, and still doubting his being dead, they wept and
> howled <span id="page_152">p. 152</span> over him, making a thousand
> apologies for having fallen upon him, and kept him so long below the
> surface. The cacique Brayaon came to examine the body and pronounced
> it lifeless; but the Indians still fearing it might possess lurking
> immortality and ultimately revive, kept watch over it for three days,
> until it showed incontestable signs of putrefaction. Being now
> convinced that the strangers were mortal men like themselves, they
> readily entered into a general conspiracy to destroy them. \[WI,
> 779.\]

   <span id="pp_67"></span>**67.**[\*](#pp_67) Certain of the Indians
(*e. g.*, Otomacs) seemingly held the view that, after death, the body
or skeleton itself turned into stone, reverted to the very material from
which some of them believed it to have originally sprung ([Sect.
*58*](aflg04.htm#pp_58)). The Atorais regard certain enormous blocks of
granite as some of their local warriors who, after death, have been
changed into stone (Cou, <span class="small">II</span>, 346). Hence we
must not be surprised to find cases where bowlders ([Sect.
*171*](aflg11.htm#pp_171) et seq.) and bones ([Sects.
*26*](aflg02.htm#pp_26), [*91*](aflg07.htm#pp_91)) possess a more or
less independent animate existence of their own. The transformation of
people into rocks and stones by way of punishment, or for other reasons,
may be a development of the same belief. Thus, a long time ago, the
Caribs came up to the Kirinampo Rocks, upper Rupununi, in order to
surprise the Makusi and destroy them from off the face of the earth; but
the good Spirit who in those days lived among the Makusis took pity on
them, and changed their enemies into these stones (ScR, <span
class="small">I</span>, 375).

   <span id="pp_68"></span>**68.**[\*](#pp_68) Having reached a higher
stage of belief, and realized that the material body does indeed undergo
dissolution at death, the Indians are convinced of a Spirit or
Something, one or more, being set free at the time of its occurrence. I
purposely say "one or more" because it would seem that originally, not
only the shadow, but also the heart, the head, and the more perceptible
of all the parts of the body where there is a pulsation of arteries, as
well as perhaps the blood ([Sect. *240A*](aflg14.htm#pp_240A)), the
spittle ([Sect. *112*](aflg08.htm#pp_112)), the footprint ([Sect.
*24*](aflg02.htm#pp_24)), and the bone ([Sect. *69*](aflg05.htm#pp_69))
were each regarded in the light of a Spirit or Something that was part
and parcel of the body, and took its departure at the material death.
The Arawak present-day conception of this Something is connected with
the person's shadow ([Sect. *253*](aflg15.htm#pp_253)); their terms for
a dead person's spirit and a person's shadow are (*h*)*iyaloko* and
(*h*)*iyá*, respectively. With these same people according as this
spirit helps or harms them, they may qualify the designation by
*satu*-(*h*)*iyaloko* when doing good, or *wakaiatu*-(*h*)*iyaloko* when
doing evil. The hiyaloko, strange to say, does not appear any further in
the folk-lore collected by me, *unless indeed it is identical with*
Iya-imi and so with Hyorokon, Yolok, etc., the word for a bush spirit, a
term which, as I propose showing ([Sect. *94*](aflg08.htm#pp_94)), is
met with throughout the extent of the Guianas, from the Orinoco to the
Amazon.

   <span id="pp_69"></span>**69.**[\*](#pp_69) The mainland Caribs term
a person's shadow *ai-akaru*, and the spirit resident in his head, his
Dream Spirit, *aka* or *akari* ([Sect. *86*](aflg06.htm#pp_86)); but
after the latter leaves the body for the forest permanently, it is <span
id="page_153">p. 153</span> known as *aka-tomba*. The Warrau expression
for the shadow is *amého-ko-i*, while *ak-óbi* is their word for 'heart'
or for the heart's Spirit which, leaving the body at death, becomes
their *Hebu*, or Bush Spirit ([Sect. *99*](aflg08.htm#pp_99)). The
Island Caribs applied the word *akamboüe* \[cf. mainland Carib
*akatomba*\] to the spirit of a person whatever it might be like, the
women speaking of it as *opoyem* (RoP, 471); unfortunately no
information is given as to the particular part of the body (head, heart,
pulse, etc.) whence it was supposed to have emanated. It was these same
islanders, however, who held strong beliefs in a connection between
spirits and an individual's heart- and pulse-beats: "they talked of the
latter as the Spirit of the Hand \[RoP, 452\]; they spoke of the
Spirit-something near the heart as Gonanni or Lanichi" (BBR, 237). This
one at the heart was the principal one, which after death went to the
sky in company with its Ichĕiri, or Chemin ([Sect.
*89*](aflg07.htm#pp_89)), to live there with other Familiar Spirits
(RoP, 484), and change into a young and new body (BBR, 237). They do not
regard the spirit as being so immaterial as it is invisible. As to their
other Spirits which have nothing to do with the heart, they believe that
some go after death to make their home on the seashore, and that it is
they who make the boats tack—these are known as *Oumekou*; they believe
that others go and live in the woods and forests—these they term
*Maboyas* (RoP, 484), or they become changed into beasts. All these
Spirits are of different sexes and multiply (BBR, 237). Koch-Grünberg
(<span class="small">II</span>, 153) makes the interesting suggestion
that certain procedures connected with some of the death festivals point
to a belief in the bones constituting the real and final resting-place
of the Spirit after the dismemberment (*Zersetzung*) of the body.

   <span id="pp_70"></span>**70.**[\*](#pp_70) The possession of a Body
Spirit, or spirits, was not, however, the prerogative solely of man,
but, as will be subsequently shown, there was a widespread belief in the
association of spirits with animal life. Survivals of this cult, in part
or in its entirety, are still recognizable in the folk-stories, in
certain omens and tokens, charms or talismans, in the observance of
certain tabus with regard to food, in blood-atonement and the treatment
of disease, and perhaps in the application of family group-names. So
also, there are similarly many traces of a corresponding association of
spirits with plant-life ([Chap. X](aflg10)).

   <span id="pp_71"></span>**71.**[\*](#pp_71) The general mainland
belief in a Something (singular or plural) emanating, disintegrating,
separating, etc., from the dead body of an individual, or an animal, and
either remaining in the immediate neighborhood or pursuing various
courses, hence becomes quite intelligible. Thus it may associate itself
with some other person, to become his spirit friend and adviser as it
were, or else may become intimately connected with the bush, forest,
fields, and trees, sometimes with stones, rocks, mountains, underground
caverns, and occasionally with stars, clouds, lightning, with rain,
river, or sea. Thus, associated <span id="page_154">p. 154</span> with
spirits already there; we can speak collectively of Dream ([Sect.
*86*](aflg06.htm#pp_86)), Familiar ([Sect. *89*](aflg07.htm#pp_89)),
Forest ([Sect. *94*](aflg08.htm#pp_94)), Mountain ([Sect.
*171*](aflg11.htm#pp_171)), Water ([Sect. *178*](aflg12.htm#pp_178)),
and Sky ([Sect. *195*](aflg13.htm#pp_195)) Spirits. I have met with no
example of a freed spirit associating itself with a person's shadow, and
hence purposely omit the term Shadow Spirits ([Sect.
*68*](aflg05.htm#pp_68)) from this category. The important thing to
remember is that two or more different kinds of spirits may have been
derived from one and the same body. The old Spanish Fathers used the
word *demonio* as a generic term for these Beings, in the same way that
some of the present-day Creoles employ the name Devil; there are,
however, too many diverse opinions held concerning the abstract and
concrete nature of the latter to permit of the term being profitably
employed for comparative purposes. Others of the Creoles as well as the
"civilized" Indians often employ the word "Mother," or *Máma* (*e. g.*,
the Mother of Powis, the Water-Mama). I propose using the term "Spirit"
throughout the following pages. Another matter to be borne in mind,
however, before proceeding further, is that these Spirits of the Forest,
Waters, etc., did not all have a human or an animal origin.
Unfortunately the evidence at present available is insufficient to
demonstrate with certainty how, or along what lines, many of them thus
closely associated with the chief physical characteristics of nature,
came to have an existence at all. Certain of them (*e. g.*, Mountain
Spirits) would seem to have been derived on a principle somewhat
analogous to that of choosing a picture to suit the frame; in other
cases, they may perhaps have been due to foreign introduction, while I
doubt not that a few, like Topsy, "growed" on their own account.

   <span id="pp_72"></span>**72.**[\*](#pp_72) The extent or degree of
the spirit's immortality, if such an expression may be used, varies from
the primitive idea of its hovering around the place of sepulture to the
advanced view of its translation, with or without apparent zoomorphic or
anthropomorphic reincarnation, to less defined realms of happiness and
bliss. There is nothing to prevent the several spirits of the one body
pursuing different courses. Indications of some of these primitive ideas
are to be found in certain of the procedures followed with the corpse,
namely, the position in which it is laid to rest, its propitiation and
address, the objects buried with it, the eating of the flesh, the
abandonment of the place of death, and other customs. "McClintock . . .
says that the . . . Akawoio races like to bury their dead in a standing
position, assigning this reason,—'Although my brother be in appearance
dead, he (*i. e.*, his soul) is still alive.' Therefore, to maintain an
outward sign this belief in immortality, some of them bury their dead
erect, which they say represents life, whereas lying down represents
death. Others bury their dead in a sitting posture, assigning the same
reason" (Br, 356). Certainly on the Pomeroon, with the Arawaks, if a
person should step over another lying down, the latter <span
id="page_155">p. 155</span> would be mortally offended, and would say,
"You can cross me only when I am dead. I am not dead yet." This is of
interest in connection with the procedure described by Schomburgk (ScR,
<span class="small">I</span>, 421) at the burial of a Makusi woman: all
the relatives next surrounded the grave, and each one jumped over it in
the direction whence he had come. Even the barely twelve-week old orphan
was taken in the arms and made to jump over it. So also at the
anniversary of the death of a captain among the Guahiba of the Vichada
River (Orinoco) the pyre is jumped over by the piai, the men, and women,
at the same time that they blow with full force ([Sect.
*85*](aflg05.htm#pp_85)) in the direction of the country occupied by the
Piaroa, their terrible neighbors who make them die through throwing
spells over them (Cr, 548).

   <span id="pp_73"></span>**73.**[\*](#pp_73) However beloved or
despised during life, the spirit of the dead is always an object of
dread, and is to be propitiated by kind and flattering expressions, by
festivals and feasts. At York Hill, near Tinadu Creek, Demerara, says
Dance (256), an Indian child had taken to the habit of eating sand,
which contributed to its early death. While the dead body of the child
lay in the open coffin, which his father had procured from a Creole
carpenter in the neighborhood, and just before the interment, the
grandmother of the child stood over it and in wailing tones said:

>    My child, I always told you not to eat sand. I never gave you any,
> for I knew it was not good for you; you always sought it yourself. I
> told you that it was bad. Now, see, it has killed you. Don't trouble
> me, for it was your own doing; some evil thing put it into your head
> (mind) to eat it. Look, I put your arrow and bow by your side that you
> may amuse yourself. I was always kind to you; be good and don't
> trouble me.

   Then the mother came up crying, and said as in a chant:

>    My child, I brought you into the world to see and enjoy all the
> good things. This breast \[and she exposed it, or rather held it up,
> for it was already exposed\] nourished you as long as you were willing
> to take it. I made your laps and pretty shirts. I took care of you and
> fed you, and played with you, and never beat you. You must be good and
> not bring evil upon me.

   The father of the dead child likewise approached and said:

>    My boy, when I told you that the sand would kill you, you would not
> listen to me, and now see, you are dead. I went out and got a
> beautiful coffin for you. I shall have to work to pay for it. I made
> your grave in a pleasant spot where you loved to play. I shall place
> you comfortably, and put some sand for you to eat, for now it can not
> harm you, and I know that you like it. You must not bring bad luck to
> me; but look for him who made you eat the sand.

   This was a family of Christian Arawaks, but the roots of inbred
traditional beliefs could not at once be eradicated.

   <span id="pp_74"></span>**74.**[\*](#pp_74) At the burial of a Makusi
woman at Nappi, upper Essequibo: Surrounding the hammock in which the
corpse lay, in and between the wailing, the women were chanting
eulogiums upon the deceased—one had lost her best friend; another
praised the fine cotton thread that she had woven; another, the various
objects that she had possessed. <span id="page_156">p. 156</span> When
the last article had passed out of the door, in came the piai: he
proceeded to the head of the corpse, bent down to the left ear, and
shouted several words into it, when he retired. The piai came back with
a bundle of hair, and bending down, exposed the corpse's face from
beneath the laths, spat on it; then plugged the hair into the ears and
mouth, while he continued spitting; then, addressing it in a harsh tone,
he retired (ScR, <span class="small">I</span>, 421). So again, at the
death of a Makusi female from the effects of a snake bite, all the women
of the village gathered in the hut and shouted unintelligible words into
the corpse's ears (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 269).<span
id="page_156_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_156_note_1)

   On the Moruca River, the Warrau women sit in a circle round the
grave, and break out ever anew with their song of mourning, which is
approximately as follows: "Why have you left your wife, children, and
friends who loved you so dearly? Why have you left your home and field,
where yams and cassava were thriving so well? . . . Who will catch
agouti, monkey, fish, and turtle for us now?" (ScR, <span
class="small">II</span>, 446.) "Why are you dead? Were you tired of
life? Did you not have cassava enough?" are among the expressions
addressed by the Island Carib women to the corpse (BBR, 252). So with
their fellow tribeswomen in Cayenne where, on a death, the men, women,
friends, and children assemble and weep, or rather sing; the singing is
done mostly by the nearest female relatives who, sitting on their heels,
slowly pass both hands over the corpse from head to foot, while
reproaching him for having let himself die. "Is it because you were not
happy with us?" say some. "What have we done for you to leave us like
this?" say others. They add: "You were such a good hunter, too! You
caught fish and crabs so well! You knew how to make a proper
provision-field," etc. (PBa, 228). On the Orinoco the Saliva mourners,
on finally eulogizing the deceased would say, "What an excellent
fisherman we have lost!" "What a clever archer has died; he never missed
his mark!" (G, <span class="small">I</span>, 197). Among the special
feasts and festivals in honor, or rather in propitiation, of the dead, I
would mention the Arawak Makuari (Mora-Kuyuha, [Sect.
*75*](aflg05.htm#pp_75)) and Hauyari dances for deceased males and
females, respectively. In the far western Guianas, the object of the
Mask dances is to propitiate the spirit of the dead, so that he will not
come back again to fetch one of the survivors (KG, 138).

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

   At the burial of a male Makusi at Pirari, not only the dead man's
knife but several thongs were buried with him. The thongs were put into
the grave for the purpose of enabling him to tie to a tree the kanaima
who had caused his death (ScR, <span class="small">I</span>, 468). Such
thongs are to be seen also at some of the funeral dances of other
tribes. Thus, among the Roucouyenne of Cayenne, at the *pono*, or first
of the two festivals in honor of the dead, one man alone stands up,
holding in his hand a whip eight meters long. With a swirling motion he
cracks it with a report like that of a pistol; each one in turn gets up
and cracks the whip (Cr, 258). At their corresponding festival the
Arawaks use whips upon each other, often inflicting terrible wounds. To
receive their flagellation, the performers put their legs forward as
does the white crane or stork (*Mycteria* sp.), the wooden effigy of
which the masters-of-ceremony carry, this particular dance as well as
the whips being thus named, after the bird, morakúyuha: this Arawak
word, corrupted now into *macquarrie*, *makuari*, etc., is seemingly of
Tupi origin, the creature being known on the lower Amazon as magoary
(HWB, 146, 316).

   <span id="pp_76"></span>**76.**[\*](#pp_76) Future provision may be
made for the deceased by burying with him his dog, his women, or his
slaves, some food, his hunting and fighting implements, and his
ornaments. Examples of these procedures are plentiful in the old
records.

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

   Many of the Indian tribes, but chiefly the Caribs, Makusi, and Akawai
have the custom of burying their dead either in the hut where they
lived, or, if a case of death should happen during a journey, a shed
covered with palm leaves is built over the grave to prevent the weather
from incommoding the person who rests beneath (ScG, 271). For the
alleged reason of making doubly sure of giving the spirit or spirits no
cause for wishing to come out of the grave, certain of the present-day
Pomeroon Arawaks are said either to plant cassava, or to place a
cassava-squeezer, upon the top of it.

   <span id="pp_77"></span>**77.**[\*](#pp_77) The eating of the
corpse's flesh or the drinking of a preparation made therefrom, except
in those cases in which cannibalism was indulged in rather by reason of
vengeance with the object of inspiring terror in their enemies (PBa,
171), was but the expression of another link in the chain of ideas which
culminated in a belief in spirit immortality. There yet remained in the
flesh and bones of the deceased certain qualities, somethings, spirits,
etc., which could be detached, separated, and transferred to the living
by means of ingestion. There is abundant evidence among these Guiana
Indians of a belief in the transference of individual (animal or human)
peculiarities through this agency ([Sects. *250*](aflg15.htm#pp_250),
[*280*](aflg16.htm#pp_280)). Thus in order to strengthen their own
courage and contempt for death, the Caribs of the upper Pomeroon would
cut out the heart of the person slain, dry it over the fire, powder it,
and then mix the powder in their drink (ScR, <span
class="small">II</span>, 430).

>    The Tariánas and Tucános (of the Uaupes River) and some other
> tribes, about a month after the funeral, disinter the corpse which is
> then much decomposed, and put it in a great pan, or oven, over the
> fire, till all the volatile parts are driven off with a most horrible
> odour, leaving only a black carbonaceous mass, which is pounded into a
> fine powder, and mixed in several large *couchés* (vats made of
> hollowed trees) of caxiri: this is drunk by the assembled company till
> all is finished; they believe that thus the virtues of the deceased
> will be transmitted to the drinkers. \[ARW, 346.\]

   The Salivas on the Orinoco also pursued the practice of digging up
the bones, burning them, and then collecting the ashes to mix with their
drinking water (Bri, 267).

   On the other hand, in the lands back \[of Cayenne\] there are nations
who disinter the bones when they consider the body is putrid enough, and
after calcining them, drink the ashes which they mix with their *vicou*,
believing that by this means they are giving the defunct a more
honorable burial than by leaving them a prey to worms and corruption
(PBa, 231).<span id="page_158_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_158_note_1)

   <span id="pp_78"></span>**78.**[\*](#pp_78) Surely it is not
unreasonable to suppose, granted certain spirits and other agencies were
believed to be contained in the corpses, that the bones of the deceased
distributed among friends and acquaintances, or slung up in their
houses, must have served a purpose other <span id="page_159">p.
159</span> than that of an every-day gift or ordinary ornament. The
Island Caribs certainly used the bones of their friends for purposes of
witchcraft and prophecy ([Sect. *91*](aflg07.htm#pp_91)). The practice
of exhuming the remains after longer or shorter intervals, although not
direct evidence, may nevertheless indicate the existence in former times
of a similar use for the bones among the Mainland Caribs and other
tribes. Thus, at the expiration of the year, the decomposed body is dug
up and the bones are distributed to all the friends and acquaintances
(St, <span class="small">I</span>, 399). The bones, having been cleaned
by the fish, are packed according to size in a basket already provided,
worked with glass beads of various colors; care is taken that the skull
of the deceased forms the lid of the basket. The basket is then hung up
to the roof of their houses (among the Warraus of the Orinoco) along
with the many other baskets containing the bones of their forefathers
(G, <span class="small">I</span>, 199). The women (among the Caribs of
the upper Pomeroon) who prepare the bones are considered unclean for
several months (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 431-2).

   <span id="pp_79"></span>**79.**[\*](#pp_79) With regard to the
abandonment by the Indians of the locality where death has taken place,
nothing can conquer their fear lest the deceased's spirit, located
somewhere in the immediate neighborhood, should do them harm. On the
Orinoco the practice of rooting up the fields which deceased has
planted, so soon as his widow or widows have buried him, is also almost
universal: They said they do it to destroy all memory of the deceased
(G, <span class="small">I</span>, 207).<span
id="page_159_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_159_note_1) With the Anabali and
other tribes of this same river, when anyone dies they bury him in the
place where he had his hearth and, covering the grave with many mats,
they forsake the village and all their fields, and build and sow at 12
or 15 leagues' distance. They say that when death has once entered their
village they can not live in security. But when these people
subsequently advanced to a settled life—as soon as the sick person died
they broke up his home and burnt everything which the deceased possessed
(ibid., 206). One of the chief's wives had died; and in consequence,
although the settlement was quite new, the houses most comfortable, the
cassava still in the field, every man had abandoned it, and left this
poor Indian to look after the crops (Rupununi River, ScG, 238). In an
Ojana village (Tuwoli's) on the Tapanahoni (Surinam) three people died
in 1907—Tuwoli's adult son Paleku, and two others. One house of Tuwoli
and one of Paleku were burned. A month later, the village was
deserted—the survivors had established themselves in another one (Go,
15). Among the Roucouyennes on the upper Parou, Cayenne, the common
laity must not make the slightest noise, or approach anywhere near the
grave of a piai, for fear of meeting his fellow-colleague, <span
id="page_160">p. 160</span> the Tiger medicine-man who guards the
corpse, but the spirits of the distinguished dead may be visited by
"doctors," by the common crowd, and by animals for the special purpose
of consultation (Cr, 298).

   <span id="pp_80"></span>**80.**[\*](#pp_80) Of other obscure burial
customs—obscure in the sense that their real signification has been only
approximately, if at all, determined—may be mentioned that of the Island
Caribs (BBR, 252) who place two weights on the eyes of the deceased, so
that he may not see his parents and thus make them ill ([Sect.
*253*](aflg15.htm#pp_253)). Most extraordinary of all, however, would
seem to be the procedure followed by the Warraus at the mouth of the
Orinoco:

>    On the death of a woman, the husband lies down in front of her. He
> remains there a few minutes, weeping and singing, and then makes way
> for each and all who have ever had connection with the deceased. As no
> Indian will willingly act contrary to the established usages of his
> tribe . . . such a custom seems calculated to prove a check upon
> persons who are not desirous of having their actions exposed to public
> notoriety. \[Cr, 612.\]

   <span id="pp_81"></span>**81.**[\*](#pp_81) While certain of the
Indians appear to hold advanced views respecting the immortality of that
particular spirit which, on its departure from the body, takes on an
anthropomorphic form, they are not in agreement as to the place of
translation. This may be identical for the spirits of "good" and of
"bad" people, as is the belief of the Warraus and the Makusi, or at all
events the places may not be very far apart (*e. g.*, the Caribs of the
Yary River, Cayenne). According to the views of these people, the
spirits of the "good" and "bad" \[within certain limitations to be
immediately discussed in this and succeeding paragraphs\] rise after
death toward the skies, which they call Capoun.<span
id="page_160_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_160_note_1) The former travel high,
very high, above the clouds where they find pretty women; they dance
every night; they drink cassiri, and do not work in the clearings
(provision-fields). The wicked remain below the clouds where they are
always roaming without any hope of getting higher. If the body is burned
immediately after death, this is done in order that the spirit may
ascend with the smoke (Cr, 298). There are interesting records left to
us concerning the Island Caribs: (*a*) Some hold that the most valiant
of their nation are carried after death to the Fortunate Isles, where
they have everything they can wish for, and that the Arawaks are their
slaves; that they swim without being tired, in the wide and large
rivers; and live delightfully and pass the time happily in dances,
games, and feasts, in a country which produces all kinds of good fruits
without being cultivated. (*b*) On the contrary those who have been
cowardly and timid in going to war against their enemies, have, after
death, to serve the Arawaks, who inhabit desert and sterile countries
which are beyond the mountains. (*c*) But others, the most brutal, do
not trouble about what takes place <span id="page_161">p. 161</span>
after death: they neither dream not talk about it (RoP, 484-485). The
Arawaks maintain that the spirits of "evil" people wander continually
around an uninhabited desolate, barren place, while those of the "good"
occupy the air above their former huts and settlements, but the
conceptions of these Indians as to "good" and "bad" are not identical
with modern European views. For instance, if an Arawak by any action of
his proves himself a coward or faint-hearted, or succumbs too frequently
to excesses in drink, he is called *mako-burokwa* \['one who forgets'\],
a man without sense, while one who shows a blameless disposition and has
remained a stranger to continual intoxication, is named a
*kaka-burokwa*, or brave man (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 497):
the spirits of two such people will be separated on the lines just
indicated. It must not be forgotten, however, that these Arawaks, of all
the Guiana Indians, have been longest in contact with civilizing
influences, and that this idea of a future existence dependent on
present conduct may be but a borrowed one. Speaking generally, the trend
of opinion among the so-called unsophisticated Indians is that certain
of the spirits of people departed hasten to a place where they will have
all they want, and meet their friends who have gone before. The
prevalent neglect of the South American natives of the sick and the want
of love in dealing with them can become intelligible, in Schomburgk's
opinion (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 318), only on the
assumption of their belief in some such religious tradition as this.

   <span id="pp_82"></span>**82.**[\*](#pp_82) Certain Venezuelan
Indians believed that the spirit retires to certain lakes and is
swallowed by monstrous serpents, which transport it to a paradise where
its time is occupied in constant dancing and drinking (FD, 52). The
Otomacs declare that peoples' souls all speed toward the West to a place
where without trouble or toil they live at ease, but before they reach
it, they are met by a big bird called Tigtitig, which seizes upon and
swallows them, unless they valorously fight it (ScR, <span
class="small">II</span>, 318). Humboldt (<span class="small">II</span>,
249) speaks of this fabulous bird as Tikitiki and makes it responsible
for the deformities of new-born children ([Sect.
*279*](aflg16.htm#pp_279)). In the province of Curoana are several lofty
mountains, the highest of which is Tumeriquiri.

   The superstitions connected with this cavern are recorded also by
Humboldt (<span class="small">I</span>, 258).

   <span id="pp_83"></span>**83.**[\*](#pp_83) It has been mentioned
([Sect. *81*](aflg05.htm#pp_81)) that in the case of a spirit taking on
an anthropomorphic form there were indications showing that its future
state may sometimes depend on the character of the individual whence it
had been derived. But mainly for the reason that the more complex ideas
on this subject, as will have been recognized from even the few
illustrations already given, are to be met with among those of the
tribes which have been longest in contact with European influences, I am
inclined to the opinion that the belief in a future condition directly
dependent on present conduct is not only of comparatively late
introduction, but is a borrowed one; the purgatorial nature of the
ordeals to be successfully undergone by the spirits ([Sect.
*82*](aflg05.htm#pp_82)) certainly savors strongly of Roman Catholic
influences. In a sense this opinion is strengthened by a study of the
Orinoco Indians, whose original beliefs have been preserved through the
careful investigations of Father Gumilla, one of the very first of the
missionaries to labor among them. I have searched his writings in vain
for any reference to the doctrine of conditional future reward or
punishment, or to that of a purgatory. In the same manner, on the Aiary
(Rio Negro), the Siusi Indians, an Arawak group which has been but
little in contact with civilizing influences, apparently make no
distinction between good and bad spirits, all the members of the tribes
after death finding their way to a forest upon high mountains on the
upper Içana (KG, <span class="small">I</span>, 166).

   <span id="pp_84"></span>**84.**[\*](#pp_84) So again there does not
appear to be sufficient warrant for many of the old travelers and
missionaries making that arbitrary distinction of "good" and "bad"
spirits (according to the bodies whence they have been derived) which
has led to so many disastrous misconceptions. The Indian's idea of these
comparative virtues is, as might have been expected, simplicity itself,
in that a spirit is good or bad according as it is for or against him,
that is, inclined to help or to harm him; it is only from this point of
view that he concerns himself with the spirit at all. A spirit may be
good as judged by its source of origin (*e. g.*, a brave man), but bad
as regards the evil which it happens to inflict upon the person
concerned. Thus it was among the Carib Islanders, that the good Familiar
Spirits, the Chemin or Icheiri, ([Sect. *67*](aflg05.htm#pp_67)) were
sent by their human associates as messengers to carry sickness and evil
to their enemies (RoP, 472). As a matter of fact, the above-mentioned
misconception of the Indian's point of view affords an excellent
illustration of the error into which certain authors have fallen in
failing to recognize the very wide <span id="page_163">p. 163</span>
distinction existing between the Evil Spirit, or Maboya, of the Carib
Islanders, and their Good Spirit, or Chemin, when pursuing evil courses.
It will be convenient to rectify this error, as far as possible, here.
Maboya, or Maboia, was undoubtedly of human origin. Thus, of the several
spirits which the body possesses ([Sect. *69*](aflg05.htm#pp_69)) some
"remain on earth changed into beasts or into Maboia" (BBR, 237): they go
and live in the woods and forests and are called Maboyas (RoP, 484).
That is to say, in the same way that others of the body's spirits attach
themselves to the waters, mountains, skies, etc., and remain there, so
the Maboya attaches itself to the bush and forest. Indeed, there can be
no doubt that the Maboya of the Antilleans corresponds in every sense
with the mainland Spirit of the Forest, that is, the Yawahu, Hebu,
Yurokon, etc. ([Sect. *94*](aflg08.htm#pp_94)). The Mainland Caribs of
Cayenne actually used the identical term Maboya (PBa, 206). The people
never invoke Maboya, as some imagine (RoP, 472): notwithstanding the
extent to which he or it may be feared, and in spite of the brutality of
the treatment received at his hands, the folk do not honor him with
offerings, prayers, adoration, or sacrifice (ibid., 476). When the
proverbial "pain and anguish wring the brow," Indians believe that these
are due to the Familiar Spirits of some of their enemies by whom they
have been sent (ibid., 473). When a person is sick, the offerings
(*anacri*, [Sect. *89*](aflg07.htm#pp_89)) laid on the little table
(*matutu*) are *not* for the Maboya, as (incorrectly) stated in one
passage by Rochefort and Poincy (ibid., 563), but for that Familiar
Spirit which had been instructed to convey the sickness, or for that
Familiar Spirit which had played an important part in effecting the
cure, as (correctly) mentioned by the same authors in another passage
(ibid., 472). It is known also that the Island, as well as the Mainland,
Caribs painted or carved a hideous figure of this spirit in front of
their canoes, not only to frighten their enemies, but in order that the
spirit's contemplation of its own likeness might divert its attention
into other channels. This figure was said to be Maboia (*e. g.*, BBR,
236), but as it would be ridiculous to assume the existence of Bush or
Forest Spirits upon the bosom of the waters, I am forced to the
conclusion that it represented a Chemin, or Familiar Spirit, capable of
course of committing good or evil according to its "master's"
instructions (cf. [Sect. *48*](aflg03.htm#pp_48)).

   <span id="pp_85"></span>**85.**[\*](#pp_85) Individuals can be
relieved of the presence of undesirable spirits by means of the
piai-rattle ([Sect. *289*](aflg17.htm#pp_289)), as well as by so-called
"kissing" and "blowing." It is this latter method that I propose
discussing here. While one writer talks of kissing being "unknown among
Indians" (IT, 193), another speaks of these people expressing tenderness
by kissing, not on the lips, but on all parts of the body (Cr, 175). If
osculation is to be regarded as a sign of amativeness, the former is an
error, because certainly among Caribs, Akawai, <span id="page_164">p.
164</span> Warraus, and Arawaks, this is expressed by man or woman, in
the protrusion of the tip of the tongue between the loosely closed lips.
What can also be considered a form of kissing is the custom of one
individual blowing upon another under particular circumstances. The
object of this blowing is explained by Schomburgk (ScR, <span
class="small">II</span>, 254) on the principle that both by the Indians
"and the Orientals, the breath is regarded as an emanation of the most
inward spiritual and mental vigor." A far more satisfactory explanation,
however, would seem to lie in the fact that the blowing is intended to
drive away an attached Evil Spirit, etc., as is indeed the belief among
the Galibi piai ([Sect. *310*](aflg17.htm#pp_310)) and elsewhere
([Sects. *14*](aflg02.htm#pp_14), [*59*](aflg04.htm#pp_59),
[*72*](aflg05.htm#pp_72), [*246*](aflg15.htm#pp_246),
[*319*](aflg17.htm#pp_319)) a view which is only strengthened by the
particular circumstances, above referred to, under which it is
practised, namely, in sickness, or in absence of adequate protecting
influences. On the way to Roraima, the Serekong "women brought us
several of their sick children for us to breathe upon their faces, and
so restore them to health" (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 253). At
Curasawaka streamlet, "a pretty-looking Makusi mother insisted upon my
blowing in the face of her sickly infant, which she believed would act
as a charm, and restore her child to health" (ScE, 177). "Before we
left, she \[the old Indian woman\] made the entire party \[on our way to
Roraima\] blow three times on her back for good luck, but whether the
luck was for her or for us we never found out" (BW, 217).

>    \[At Taiepong Village, upper Potaro\] when on the point of leaving,
> a woman stepped forward to an old Indian in one of our canoes, and
> held up her head. He tapped her forehead with his fingers, muttered a
> few words, and then blew on her temple. This was done to charm away a
> pain in the head, the old fellow being a peaiman, and capable of
> effecting such cures. On our arrival at villages I have sometimes seen
> a woman carry her infant round to one after another of the Indians of
> my party, each man as she passed stooping down and blowing gently on
> the face of the child. \[Bro, 202.\]

   Among the Arawak and the Warrau, when the child cries, or when father
or mother leave it to set out on the chase, to work in the field, etc.,
they will blow either on the child's face or hand; but they do nothing
of the sort on their return. It is a Makusi custom for the infant to be
blown upon (*angeblasen*) by the relatives, before its parents take to
their hammocks (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 314) to keep the
couvade. With the same tribe, the piai will blow upon the girl after the
menstruation ceremony with the object of disenchanting her ([Sect.
*267*](aflg16.htm#pp_267)).

<span id="page_156_note_1"></span>[1](#page_156_fr_1) In these last two
examples there is difficulty in interpreting the real signification of
the shouting into the ears—whether it is the deceased or the mischievous
spirit causing the death ([Sect. *310*](aflg17.htm#pp_310)) that is
being addressed. In North Queensland I have observed a similar custom.
There, the seat of intelligence, life, etc., is located in the ear; and
at death these escape through this exit: hence, by shouting into the
deceased's ears his friends are trying to restore these essentials to
their proper place.—W. E. R.
