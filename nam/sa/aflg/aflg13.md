   <span id="pp_195"></span>**195.**[\*](#pp_195.md) The Sun seems to have
been regarded invariably as a male ([Sect. *29*](aflg02.htm#pp_29).md): The
Salibas of the Orinoco—certainly a section of the tribe—claimed to be
his children (G, <span class="small">I</span>, 113). At Enamouta
Village, on a branch of the Ireng, it would appear to be the usual
practice for the Indians to issue simultaneously from their houses at
daylight and greet the morn with cries and loud shouts (Bro, 129). It
was customary for the Otomacs to bewail the dead as a matter of daily
routine. "Thus, as soon as the cocks crow, about 3 o'clock in the
morning, the air is rent with a sad and confused sound of cries and
lamentations, mixed with tears and other appearances of grief. They
mourn not by way of ceremony, but in very truth. When day breaks, the
wailing ceases and joy reigns" (G, <span class="small">I</span>, 167).
So also on the Vichada, a branch of the Orinoco, the Guahibos at sunrise
come out with a pan-pipe and make the round of the village while playing
on this instrument, but their purpose in doing so is not made clear (Cr,
554). Among the Wapisianas of the upper Rio Branco, the first to awake
strikes a drum until all jump out of their hammocks, and, in the
meantime, with a quick step, he will promenade around the maloka with
his barbarous music (Cou, <span class="small">II</span>, 268). With the
Island Caribs the flute is ordinarily played in the morning when they
rise (RoP, 509).

   <span id="pp_196"></span>**196.**[\*](#pp_196.md) It is said by im Thurn
that on one occasion, during an eclipse of the sun, the Arawak men among
whom he happened to be rushed from their houses with loud shouts and
yells: they explained that a fight was going on between the Sun and the
Moon, and they shouted to frighten and so part the combatants (IT, 364).
Brett speaks of Oroan,<span
id="page_254_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_254_note_1.md) the great Demon of
Darkness, who causes eclipses; he seizes <span id="page_255">p.
255</span> the Sun and strives to quench the fire, till scorched and
blackened, he retires, only to return another time ([BrB,
189](../lmbg/lmbg5b.htm#page_189).md). In Cayenne, eclipses of the Sun and
Moon upset the Indians a good deal: they think some frightful monster
has come to "devour these heavenly bodies. If the eclipse is total or of
short duration, they consider it a fatal thing for them: they make a
terrible noise, and shoot a volley of arrows into the air to chase away
the monster (PBa, 232). Island Caribs attribute the eclipses to Maboia,
the devil, who tries to kill Sun and Moon: "they say that this wicked
seducer cuts their hair by surprise, and makes them drink the blood of a
child, and that, when they are totally eclipsed, it is because the
Stars, being no longer warmed by the Sun's rays and light, are very ill"
(Ti, 1886, p. 227).

   <span id="pp_198"></span>**198.**[\*](#pp_198.md) The Moon also is
clothed with male attributes, and among the tribes here dealt with, as
is the case with many another savage race, is held responsible for
certain conditions met with during the child-bearing period of woman's
life. I have heard the following tradition among both Arawaks and
Warraus:

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

   <span id="pp_199"></span>**199.**[\*](#pp_199.md) A peculiar custom
among the Makusis, practised as soon as the new moon is visible ([Sect.
*227*](aflg14.htm#pp_227).md), is that of all the men standing before the
doors of their huts, and drawing their arms backward and forward in its
direction at short intervals: by this means they are strengthened for
the chase (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 328). "As soon as the new
moon appears, they all run out of their huts and cry *Look at the moon!*
. . . They take certain leaves, and after rolling them in the shape of a
small funnel, they pass some drops of water through it into the eye,
while looking at the moon. This is very good for the sight" (BBR, 228).
The first night of the incoming moon was considered the proper occasion
for obtaining clay for the manufacture of pots and other utensils which,
it was believed, would not speedily be broken ([Sect.
*258*](aflg15.htm#pp_258).md).

   <span id="pp_200"></span>**200.**[\*](#pp_200.md) With regard to the
explanations given as to the nature of the eclipse of the moon, I have
obtained the following at first-hand from the Pomeroon Arawaks. The
phenomenon is due to its traveling along the Sun's path, falling asleep,
and so not being able to get out of the way quickly enough. With the
object of awakening the Moon members of this tribe strike drums, blow
shells, and make a big noise generally, whenever the eclipse takes
place. They must also keep themselves lively and active, and during the
whole night must eat absolutely nothing; were they to break the fast,
they would change into whatever animal or plant they might be eating
([Sect. *248*](aflg15.htm#pp_248).md). Indeed, it is a common belief among
these people that, at the time of an eclipse, there is a constant change
or transformation-scene taking place on Nature's stage, in both animal
and vegetable kingdoms, owing to this cause. The transformation is not
necessarily sudden but may take time. I can call to mind an old Arawak
story of a hunter who had gone to visit one of the streams away back
from the Moruca River: On the first occasion he sees a huge land-camudi;
on the second, at the time of an eclipse, he finds the snake changed
into a tapir; and on the third he sees it swimming in the water as a
manati.

   <span id="pp_201"></span>**201.**[\*](#pp_201.md) As to the Orinoco
Indian tribes, Gumilla has left us some very interesting records
concerning the eclipse of the moon. Some of these nations believed that
it was about to die: others that it was angry with them, and that it
would give them no more light. The Loláca and Atabáca Indians held to
the death theory (G, <span class="small">II</span>, 274) and were under
the conviction that if the Moon were indeed to die, all exposed fires
would be extinguished. Their women, crying and yelling—an outburst in
which the men joined—accordingly would each seize a glowing ember and
hide it, either in the sand or underground. Moved by their tears and
entreaties, the Moon however recovers, and the hidden fires are
extinguished: but were he indeed to die, the concealed embers would
remain alight. The Salivas had different views (G, <span
class="small">II</span>, 277). All the warriors stand up in rows facing
the Moon, offering him their prowess and strength and entreating <span
id="page_258">p. 258</span> him not to leave them. The young men, of 15
to 20 years of age, stand in two rows apart while certain old men
roughly thrash them in turn with whips. Finally, the women, in a sea of
tears bewail the Moon's projected departure and fatal absence. The idea
would seem to be that the Moon has enemies whom, through fear, he is
anxious to avoid, and he is therefore desirous of giving the benefit of
his light to other nations. It is only the promises of these Indian
warriors to fight in his favor which allay his fears, and hence there is
no necessity for him really to take himself off. As soon as the Guayánas
(G, <span class="small">II</span>, 278) recognize an eclipse of the
moon, they take up the implements used in cultivating their fields. With
much talk and gesticulation, some cut the undergrowth, others clear it,
and others again dig up the ground, all of them loudly proclaiming that
the Moon has cause for being annoyed, and particularly good reason for
forsaking them, considering that they had never made a field for him.
They accordingly beg him not to go, because they are now providing him
with a field, in which they propose planting maize, cassava, and
plantains. With these promises and entreaties they continue at their
task, working on it with vigor so long as the eclipse lasts; and as soon
as it is over, they return to their houses overjoyed. But there is no
more working on the field in the Moon's behalf until the next eclipse
takes place! Among the Otomacs (G, <span class="small">II</span>, 279),
when the event occurs, the husbands aimlessly take up their weapons,
skip about, and yell beyond measure, stretch the arrow on the bow in
sign of anger, and ask, beg, and implore the Moon not to die. While they
continue in their grief, the Moon goes on diminishing and languishing.
Recognizing from this that their actions are not understood, they run
back to their houses, where they bitterly reproach their wives for not
grieving over and bewailing the Moon's sickness. The latter make not the
slightest sign that they understand what is expected of them, and answer
never a word. The men then change their tactics and start begging and
beseeching their wives to cry and weep, so that the Moon may revive and
not die. Still the women act as if they do not understand what is
besought of them. So the men give them presents—glass-beads,
monkey-tooth necklaces, jewelry, and the like. The women now understand
in truth, and saying many prayers soon make the Moon shine as bright and
clear as before—for doing which they earn their husbands' gratitude.
According to their idea it is the female voices that move the Moon to
take compassion on them, and save them from extinction.

   <span id="pp_202"></span>**202.**[\*](#pp_202.md) The Uaupes River (Rio
Negro) Indians believe that at an eclipse, Jurupari ([Sect.
*101*](aflg08.htm#pp_101).md) is killing the Moon; they make all the noise
they can to frighten him away (ARW, 348). So again, the Island Caribs
say that Maboya ([Sect. *84*](aflg05.htm#pp_84).md) is eating the Moon on
such an occasion: they dance all night, and rattle their calabashes with
<span id="page_259">p. 259</span> little pebbles inside (RoP, 461).
Schomburgk points out the curious fact that the Taruma word for a moon
eclipse is *piwa-toto*, the literal translation of which is 'Moon-Earth'
(ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 469).

   <span id="pp_203"></span>**203.**[\*](#pp_203.md) Any reference to
comets in the Indian literature is extremely scarce. With regard to the
one that was seen by Schomburgk in the early forties, the Arekunas and
Makusis regarded it as a sign of pestilence, famine, and disaster. One
night they all emerged from their huts . . . men, women, and children
extended their arms expressive of supplication and beseeched it to leave
the heavens, so that they should not come to grief under its influence .
. . the Makusis called it Ca-po-eseima, "Fire-Cloud," or Wae-inopsa,
"Sun that throws its rays behind"; the Arekunas gave it the name of
Wa-taima, and the Wapisianas Capische, both terms signifying "Spirit of
the Stars" (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 308). The Pomeroon
Arawaks speak of the present year's (1910), Halley's, comet, simply as
Wiwa-kihi-koro (lit. "Star-tail-with"), but have no information to
furnish concerning it. Among the Island Caribs, Limacani is a comet sent
by Coualina, the "boss" of the Chemeens \[i. e., Familiar Spirits\] to
cause evil when he is vexed (BBR, 231).

   <span id="pp_203A"></span>**203A.**[\*](#pp_203A.md) In the Makusi
legend of Murapa-yeng (lit. Bat Mountain, one of the Pakaraima Range)
the phenomenon is ascribed to an old woman carrying a fire-stick under
somewhat pathetic circumstances: Schomburgk tells the story.

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

   <span id="pp_204"></span>**204.**[\*](#pp_204.md) Arawaks, Warraus, in
fact all the Indian tribes of whom we have reliable accounts, possess
myths and legends indicative of more or less animistic conception of the
stars and constellations.

   Dance (270) says that Eweiwah, or Huewah (Arawak), and Koiunuk
(Akawai) are the names of the Morning and Evening stars interchangeably,
these tribes supposing that they are one and the same. Brett (Br, 107),
on the other hand, gives the Arawak name for Venus as Warakoma
\[Warukóma\], and that generally used for Jupiter as Wiwa Kalimero (i.
e. the star of brightness). The Warraus here on the Pomeroon call the
Morning Star Okona-kura. She it was who stuck in the hole when her
people first came down from above the skies to populate the earth
([Sect. *51*](aflg04.htm#pp_51).md). The Makusis speak of the Evening Star
as Kai-wono, wife of the Moon, because she is to be seen in his near
neighborhood, and also on account of her shining more brightly than all
the other stars (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 328). According to
Father Gili, the Indians of the Casiquiare believed that the dew which
falls by night was the spittle of the stars (AR, 207), a belief similar
to that reported of the Makusis. The Caribs ascribed it to the urination
of the stars (ScR, <span class="small">I</span>, 429). The Makusis speak
of shooting stars as Wai-taima (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>,
328). The Island Caribs regarded all the heavenly bodies as Carib.
Father de la Borde mentions some five or six stars in their cosmogony,
but unfortunately has apparently not identified them. Racumon was one of
the first Caribs made by Louquo; he was transformed into a large snake
with the head of a man; he was always seated on a cabatas (a hard and
high tree); he lived on its fruit, which resembles a large plum or small
apple, and which he gave sometimes to those who passed; he is now
changed into a star. "Savacou was also a Carib. He was changed into a
large bird; he is the captain of the Storms and Thunders; he has caused
the heavy rains, and is also a star now. Achinaon, a Carib, at present a
star, causes light rain and strong winds. Couroumon (a Carib), also a
star, causes the heavy sea waves, and upsets canoes; he is also the
cause of flood and ebb." (BBR, 229.)

   <span id="pp_205"></span>**205.**[\*](#pp_205.md) Arawaks speak of the
Milky Way under two names, one of which signifies the Path of the
Maipuri (Tapir), and the other is the Path of the Bearers of Wai-é, a
species of white clay of which their vessels are made. The nebulous
spots are supposed to be the tracks of Spirits whose feet were smeared
with that material (Br, 107). On equally reliable authority we are told
that the three nebulæ within the Milky Way represent a tapir being
chased by a dog, followed by a jaguar, who is not particular in choice,
so that he take either the dog or the tapir. Another legend is that the
nebulæ were formed by celestial wild hogs rooting up the white clay (Da,
296). The Makusis call the Milky Way Parana, a term which they apply
also to the sea.

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

   <span id="pp_206"></span>**206.**[\*](#pp_206.md) With regard to the
Southern Cross, Dance talks of it as being the great White Crane, and
gives a legend relative to it (Da, 296). Arawaks and Warraus, however,
have told me that this represents the powis (*Crax* sp.), the nearer
"pointer" to it being the Indian just about to let fly his arrow, the
farther one indicating his companion with a fire-stick running up
behind. This constellation serves also as an indication for the hunting
of the bird, Schomburgk recording (ScT, 23) how, when the Cross stands
erect, the powis commences its low moan ([Sect.
*98*](aflg08.htm#pp_98).md). The Makusis apparently regard the Southern
Cross as the home of the Spirit of this bird.

   <span id="pp_207"></span>**207.**[\*](#pp_207.md) There are two groups
of stars described by the Arawaks and certain of the Warraus, as the
Babracote and the Camudi: four bright stars (Pegasus) with four
imaginary connecting lines constitute the square frame of the former,
another thick cluster (Scorpio) representing the Snake. This is the
Arawak story:

   <span id="pp_208"></span>**208.**[\*](#pp_208.md) The Pleiades, the
Seven Stars, bore a very important rôle in the daily life of the Guiana
Indians in that, among several other reasons, their rising from the east
marked the commencement of their new year: this measurement of time was
adopted from the Orinoco to Cayenne. All the legends relating to the
constellations Taurus and Orion have something in common in the detail
of an amputated arm or leg. Dance speaks of the Stars forming the belt
and sword-sheath of the constellation Orion (Da, 343) as Mabukuli
(Arawak) or Ibbeh-pughn (Akawai). Now the word Mabukuli signifies
"without leg," and the corresponding little story which he relates (Da,
296) will not prove out of place here: "A huntsman being unsuccessful in
the chase one day, and being loth to return without flesh for his
stepmother, whom he loved, cut off one of his own legs, and wrapping it
up in leaves, presented it to her as veritable game; and then ascended
into the heavens as Mabukuli (Ibbeh-pughn) or one-legged."

   <span id="pp_209"></span>**209.**[\*](#pp_209.md) The Legend of the
Tumong, or Seven Stars, as told by Dance (296), apparently from Akawai
sources, is this:

   <span id="pp_211"></span>**211.**[\*](#pp_211.md) Brett's account ([BrB,
191](../lmbg/lmbg5b.htm#page_191).md) is of interest in comparison with the
Warrau story, and I accordingly adapt it here from the metrical version.
Before doing so, however, I can but express the probability that the
idea of making Aldebaran (the Bull's-eye in our constellation Taurus)
the organ of vision for the Tapir—making, in fact, the Tapir correspond
with the Bull—is the result of contact with African or European
influences. Brett calls the myth the Legend of Sirikoai, and from
internal evidence (cf. [Sect. *38*](aflg02.htm#pp_28).md) I am inclined to
think that he must have received it from Carib sources. Sirikio is the
Carib name for a star, Wailya for a watchman, and Wawa (cf. Wawaiya) for
a sister or a wife: on the other hand, Sahtai is the Akawai name for an
ax.

   <span id="pp_213"></span>**213.**[\*](#pp_213.md) Rain can be produced
as well as stopped by human, animal, or spirit agency, but at the same
time would appear to have an independent existence. To make rain on the
Pomeroon, one of the authorized methods consists in plunging into water
a length of cassava stalk held at one extremity. Next the stalk must be
tied up in the center of a bundle of other cassava stalks, and the whole
left to soak in water: rain is sure to fall within twenty-four hours.
Another method practised here is to wash in water the scrapings from one
of an alligator's largest teeth. Arawaks as well as Warraus believe also
in the piai or any layman burning the carcass of a camudi as an
inducement for the rain to fall. The Oyambis of Cayenne have the same
belief in the efficacy of the killing of a snake (Cr, 174). On the
Kamwatta Creek, in the Moruca River district, there is a half-submerged
tree stump, known as Ibúma (lit. "young woman," in the Warrau language),
believed to be the site where either an Indian murdered his wife or
where she killed herself. In dry weather the tree is exposed, and as the
Indians pass it in their corials, they call out, "Ibúma!" and slash
their cutlasses into it, with the avowed purpose of making the woman
vexed, and so causing the rain to fall. Rain can also be made to fall in
this district by cursing the black kurri-kurri bird as mentioned in the
story of the Medicine-man and the Carrion Crows ([Sect.
*303*](aflg17.htm#pp_303).md). On the upper Mazaruni it is a large eagle
and a camudi that can cause the rain to fall (Bro, 399); frogs are
reputed to be able to do the same thing ([Sect.
*46*](aflg03.htm#pp_46).md).

   <span id="pp_214"></span>**214.**[\*](#pp_214.md) The infringement of
certain taboos can also entail a downpour of rain. For instance, when
traveling on the sea or any other large sheet of water, as a big river,
the Indians (Arawaks, Warraus, etc.) have to be very careful as to what
they do with the pot-spoon, the *haráro* of the Arawaks ([Sect.
*193*](aflg12.htm#pp_193).md). After use they must wash it in the traveling
boat or wait until they get on land, but never wash it in the river or
sea: otherwise, big squalls and storms will arise. Nor must any fresh
water be spilt in the traveling boat ([Sect. *219*](aflg13.htm#pp_219).md).
Near the Chichi Falls, upper Mazaruni, on giving the Indians rice to
cook that evening, the men told them to wash it first by dipping the
earthen pot into water, but to this they demurred, saying that if they
placed their pot in the water the rain would fall more heavily (Bro,
397). In the same way a Cayenne bush-negro, in order to stop the rain,
advises his fellow-servant not to wash the inside of the pot (Cr, 276).

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

   <span id="pp_215"></span>**215.**[\*](#pp_215.md) Conversely, the rain
can be stopped. Near Mora Village, on the upper Rupununi, there was a
hill close by on which, the Indian said, a "Spirit at the approach of
the end of the rainy season, made a noise like the report of a gun to
stop the rain" (Bro, 138). "We passed an old man," says Brett (Br, 169),
"fishing in a canoe on the Manawarin. The clouds threatened rain, and
when he perceived it, he began to use extraordinary gesticulations,
flourishing his arms, and shouting his incantations to drive it away. It
soon cleared up, and the old sorcerer rejoiced at his success, as he
deemed it." So again, Dance (p. 234), on the Potaro: "A cloud was
gathering windward, and threatened rain. The Indian who had the front
paddle in my woodskin commenced to blow away the threatening rain cloud.
This he attempted to do by blowing into his fist and dashing his hand
upward toward the cloud." Schomburgk describes a similar manoeuver
executed by a Warrau (ScR, <span class="small">I</span>, 186). On the
Pomeroon, should rain fall at a time when it is particularly not
desired, as when traveling in an exposed corial, one of the occupants
will address the "Boss" Spirit of the Rain somewhat as follows: "Pass
on. We don't want you here. Clear out to the head of the river where you
are wanted," at the same time pointing with his finger toward the
direction he wishes it to take. Another of the occupants will as often
as not then get up in the boat on all fours and, pointing his posterior
in the direction of the Rain, will address it with an obscene remark.
The Being thus addressed is Uni-shidu, so called by the Arawaks from
Uni, the Rain, and Shidu, a term applied to any chief or boss. As first
recorded by Bancroft (312), it is noteworthy that if it rains at the
time, the medicine-man will postpone his incantations.

   <span id="pp_216"></span>**216.**[\*](#pp_216.md) The Arawaks speak of
the Rainbow as Yawarri (*Didelphys* sp.), the reddish color of its fur
bearing some fancied resemblance to the coloration of the bow. These
same people (certainly in the Pomeroon District) hold that white people
are coming from the direction where they see a rainbow: On inquiry, I
learn that the connection between this natural phenomenon and the
European lies in the high arched forehead of the latter. The Island
Caribs more or less personified it as Joulouca \[? another form of the
word Yurokon, [Sect. *94*](aflg08.htm#pp_94.md)\], the Rainbow Spirit,
which lives on fish, lizards, pigeons, and humming birds, and is covered
with fine feathers of all colors, especially on the head. He is the
rain-bow which we see: the clouds prevent us from seeing the rest of the
body. He makes the Carib ill when it finds nothing to eat above. If this
fine Iris appears when they are at sea, they take it as a good omen of a
prosperous journey. When it appears to them while they are on land, they
hide in ther homes and think that it is a strange and masterless spirit
which seeks to kill somebody" (BBR, 231).

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

   <span id="pp_217"></span>**217.**[\*](#pp_217.md) As will be seen from
the following list, weather forecasting must be somewhat easy for the
Indians. Unfortunately I have been unable to discover at first hand, the
connection, if any, between the sign and the event, that is, whether it
is a case of cause and effect, at the instigation of some Spirit, human
or animal. On the Moruca River, rain will fall or an accident of some
sort will happen to the person hearing the karra-suri (small kingfisher)
or the fika-wanna (a little bird with red legs and its long tail)
whistle notes; so again, certainly on the same river, if when the
weather happens to be dry, the kaiokochi (crocodile) "barks" late of an
afternoon, rain is certain to follow either that night or during the
course of the following day. When the river ibis, or kurri-kurri (*Ibis
infuscatus*), utters its cries in the evening, the natives of the Cuyuni
say it is a sure sign that rain will fall during the night (Bro, 21).
Gumilla makes the curious statement (G, <span class="small">I</span>,
289) that the manati is to be seen taking big jumps out of the water a
day before rain falls. On the Pomeroon and Moruca, among the Arawaks,
when plenty of swallows are seen, or the toucans cry loudly, or various
frogs (as the akura, tontonli, kure-kure, warra-raura) are heard, or a
little insect (the kudu-kudu) chirps, or the yarau fish are found
bearing plenty of eggs, wet weather is believed to be approaching. In
Cayenne, the araqua or paraqua is the rain-bird of the Ouajana Indians.
A long spell of dry weather may be expected when any large camudi is
found high up on a tree, and a correspondingly short one if the serpent
is but a small one and only a few feet from the ground (Arawaks and
Warraus, Moruca River). Again, if a Pomeroon Arawak hears the kukui (a
hawk somewhat like a 'carrion crow') he knows the sound presages
prolonged dry weather; what is more curious still, he and his people
when they hear this sound rush to the pepper trees around the house and
shake them with a view to making them bear more peppers. There are two
birds that I shall always be glad to hear singing, the warri-kuma and
the dara ("bell-bird," *Chasmarhynchus*), because the Arawaks have
taught me that they indicate the coming of plenty of sunshine. Some
Indians enjoy the same prospect when they hear the baboon howling.

   <span id="pp_218"></span>**218.**[\*](#pp_218.md) The Cayenne Indians
are not so much afraid of thunder as of an eclipse; they believe the
former is caused by piai who, climbing up into the skies, makes this
frightful noise (PBa, 233). As soon as they recognize the approaching
storm which usually accompanies the thunder, the Island Caribs at once
make for their houses, and stepping into the kitchen, seat themselves on
their little stools close to the fire. Here, hiding their faces, and
resting their heads upon their hands and knees, they commence to cry,
bewailing in their gibberish that Maboya ([Sect.
*84*](aflg05.htm#pp_84).md) is much angered with them. They do the same
thing when there is a hurricane on (RoP, 486). The Uaupes <span
id="page_270">p. 270</span> River Indians blame their corresponding
spirit, the Jurupari, for the thunderstorms; it is at these times that
he is angry with them (ARW, 348). The Kobéuas believe that at death
separation of spirit from body is taking place (KG, <span
class="small">II</span>, 152). Warraus believe thunder to be the roar of
Black Tiger ([Sect. *148*](aflg09.htm#pp_148).md). The Surinam negroes
regard the old-time Indian stone weapons as thunderbolts, and look on
them as talismans with which they part only with reluctace (WJ, 71).
Many people \[? Indians, ? Spaniards\] at Caracas and elsewhere wear
them on their necks as amulets for protection against lightning and
thunder (AR, 461).

   <span id="pp_219"></span>**219.**[\*](#pp_219.md) With regard to storms
generally, the Carib lslanders—

>    When they have to cross over sea to go to another island—like St.
> Alousi or St. Vincent . . . no pure water is drunk, and they are very
> careful not to spill any in the canoe or in the sea ([Sect.
> *193*](aflg12.htm#pp_193).md); it would cause the sea to swell and make
> rain and bad weather come. . . . They cannot pass certain places at
> sea without throwing over food: it is for some Caribs who have
> perished there, and now have their huts at the bottom of the sea. They
> could otherwise not pass without the boat capsizing. When a storm
> cloud is seen, they all blow in the air and drive it away with their
> hands to turn the rain in another direction. To make the sea calm, and
> allay a storm, they chew cassava, then spit it in the air and sea to
> appease the *Chemeen* ([Sect. *89*](aflg07.htm#pp_89).md) who is perhaps
> angry because he is hungry. If they have an unfavorable wind, an old
> man out of the crowd takes an arrow and hits the hydrant of the canoe,
> which is supposed to let the canoe go as straight as an arrow: if a
> gust of wind makes them lose sight of land, they consult the devil.

<span id="page_254_note_1"></span>[1](#page_254_fr_1.md) Warraus tell me
that this word is a form of Yurokon, the name of the Carib Bush
Spirit.—W. E. R.

<span id="footnotes_page_255">p. 255</span>

<span id="page_255_note_1"></span>[1](#page_255_fr_1.md) This word *okóhi*
smong the Warraus means the hottest part of the day; it refers to the
warmth and heat of the sun as distinguished from its power of producing
light.

<span id="page_255_note_2"></span>[2](#page_255_fr_2.md) Even up to very
recent times the Indians' canoes were thus decorated with Sun and Moon.

<span id="page_255_note_3"></span>[3](#page_255_fr_3.md) This sound would
correspond with the English "Swish! Swish! Swish!"

<span id="page_255_note_4"></span>[4](#page_255_fr_4.md) This is the Warrau
term for any smart, sensible female.

<span id="footnotes_page_256">p. 256</span>

<span id="page_256_note_1"></span>[1](#page_256_fr_1.md) On the march the
Indians always walk in file, the men leading.

<span id="page_256_note_2"></span>[2](#page_256_fr_2.md) This is the name
of an obsolete form of musical instrument, which none of my Warrau
friends have ever seen, but have only heard of, and hence can not
furnish me with particulars. From indirect evidence, however, I am
inclined to believe that it was some form or the "crow-skull"
gourd-flute—the Warrau *bure-akwa*.—W. E. R.

<span id="page_256_note_3"></span>[3](#page_256_fr_3.md) This sound would
correspond with our hootiti-tootiti, etc.

<span id="page_256_note_4"></span>[4](#page_256_fr_4.md) This is the Arawak
version. The Warraus say that, instead of soot, she used the *humatuba*,
the blue paint of the Caribs.

<span id="page_256_note_5"></span>[5](#page_256_fr_5) Ehrenreich (37.md)
cites a somewhat similar story of incest and subsequent discovery, in
which the girl, however, becomes the Moon, given by Barboza Rodriguez,
from the Rio Jamunda.

<span id="footnotes_page_263">p. 263</span>

<span id="page_263_note_1"></span>[1](#page_263_fr_1.md) This name (lit.
"Leg-half") is Warrau; its signification here will be seen below.

<span id="page_263_note_2"></span>[2](#page_263_fr_2.md) This female was
really a Bush Spirit, or Hebu, and though of the same name has nothing
whatever to do with the old man mentioned in the story in [Sect.
*29*](aflg02.htm#pp_29.md).

<span id="footnotes_page_264">p. 264</span>

<span id="page_264_note_1"></span>[1](#page_264_fr_1.md) He could not, of
course, speak to the old woman directly, she being his mother-in-law; he
himself was precluded from bringing the fish up to the house, as this
procedure would spoil his luck ([Sect. *244*](aflg15.htm#pp_244).md).

<span id="page_264_note_2"></span>[2](#page_264_fr_2.md) In another Warrau
version of the same story, Nohi-abassi sets a big cage-trap for the
fish, and asks an alligator to remain alongside, for the same purpose
and with similar results.

<span id="footnotes_page_266">p. 266</span>

<span id="page_266_note_1"></span>[1](#page_266_fr_1.md) When I reminded
the old Warrau informant that Indians had no looks and keys, she told me
that the story as told above is just as she heard it, and that old time
people do not like to mention bad (i. e. indecent) things.—W. E. R.
