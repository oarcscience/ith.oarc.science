## C<span class="small">HAPTER</span> II TRIBAL HEROES

   <span class="small">Alubiri or Hubuiri; Hariwali and the Wonderful
Tree (*[3](#pp_3)-8*); The Story of Haburi (*[9](#pp_9)-18*.md).

the Sun, the Frog, and the Firesticks—Warrau version

   <span id="pp_3"></span>**3.**[\*](#pp_3.md) Some of the mythic Heroes
have a history peculiarly their own, of which it is now proposed to give
a few particulars.

   I will begin with Alubiri, or Hubuiri, for whom Hilhouse, as already
stated ([Sect. *2*](aflg01.htm#pp_2).md), found a place in the Arawak
cosmogony, a view which Schomburgk indorsed, with a reference to him,
however, as one "who does not trouble himself about men." In Brett's
time, however, and at the present day, throughout the Pomeroon district
the Hero seemingly appears only under the name Haburi. The Pomeroon
Warrau now claim Haburi as their particular Hero, in just the same way
as Brett ([BrB, 76](../lmbg/lmbg2b.htm#page_76).md) did for them under the
name Abore. For my own part I suspect that the term Alubiri is but
another form of the name Oruperi, the mythical Carib snake ([Sect.
*235*](aflg14.htm#pp_235).md), which gave rise to all the hunting *binas*,
and that Haburi has some philological connection with Yaperi-Kuli, the
Hero ([Sect. *45*](aflg03.htm#pp_45).md) of the Siusi branch of the Arawak
stock. It is only for the reason that an old Arawak friend identified
Hariwali (cf. Arawanili, [Sec. *185*](aflg12.htm#pp_185).md) with Haburi—an
identity which I admittedly can neither confirm nor challenge—that I
propose beginning with these mythic Heroes by introducing the story of—

>    Hariwali was a clever, painstaking *piai*, who spent most of his
> time in clearing the field for his two wives. These two women, their
> children, and his brother lived with him at his house. While felling
> the timber, the wives undertook, turn and turn about, to bring their
> husband some cassiri daily. It happened now that while carrying the
> usual refreshment one of the wives was met by the brother-in-law, who
> was bringing in some itiriti strands to weave baskets with. "Hullo!"
> he said, "where are you going?" to which he received reply, "I am
> taking cassiri to my husband; the field.—But I like you. Do you like
> me?" "No, I don't," he answered, "and even if I did, my brother, being
> a medicine-man, would find it out very soon." She tried him again, and
> tempted him sorely, and then she threw her arms round him. He was but
> mortal. . . . She assured him that her husband would never find out
> what had happened, and both went their respective ways. Before she
> reached the field, however, she broke the calabash; then with a
> pointed stick she cut her knee, causing it to bleed. When Hariwali saw
> her coming slowly along with a limp carrying the broken calabash, he
> asked her what had happened. All she could do was to point to the
> scratch and blood on her lame knee, and tell him that she had <span
> id="page_121">p. 121</span> had an accident, having fallen on a stump.
> He was a shrewd *piai*, however, and knew exactly what had happened,
> and though he said nothing then, he determined not only upon getting
> rid of her, but of his other wife also; he just then, however,
> directed her to return home.
>
>    <span id="pp_4"></span>**4.**[\*](#pp_4.md) Next morning he bade both
> the women accompany him, as he intended fishing in the pond, and he
> merely wanted them to do the cooking and make the fire. When fire had
> been made, he brought them a turtle, which they put on the hot ashes
> without killing it, so it promptly crawled out; they pushed it on
> again, but with the same result. It was the omen betokening their
> death. The *semi-chichi* \[medicine-man\] had bewitched them and they
> thought they had already killed the turtle. What they imagined was
> that the fire was not hot enough, and so the faithless spouse went to
> look for more dry wood. Now, as she was breaking up the timber she
> found it very hard work, and exclaimed *Tata*—Ketaiaba (*lit*. hard—to

>    <span id="pp_5"></span>**5.**[\*](#pp_5.md) Hariwali thus punished his

> to hunt, but neither spoke. That same afternoon the brother, who had
> never missed a bird before, made a bad shot every time now, the arrow
> invariably flying absurdly wide of its mark. This was really all
> Hariwali's doing. At last the brother did manage to hit a bird, but
> only just hard enough to knock a few feathers off, nothing more.
> "Don't do that again," said the bird, "and now look behind you." And
> when he did so, there was a large sheet of water, and he realized that
> he was upon an island. But how to escape? Round and round he wandered,
> until he finally found a path; no ordinary path, but a Yawahu's path
> leading to the Spirit's house. Arrived at the house, the Yawahu caught
> him, and took all his bones out except those of his fingers; this was
> done only out of kindness, so that he could not escape, the Yawahu
> putting him into a hammock and paying him every care and
> attention.<span id="page_121_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_121_note_1.md) The
> bones themselves were tied up in a bundle under the roof (as bundles
> are kept by many other Indian tribes). The Yawahu was quite a family

> bows and arrows; when their arrows got blunted they had only to go up
> to the captive's hammock and sharpen them on his bony finger tips. All
> this time, Hariwali's mother would cry regularly every night over her
> absent son, whose whereabouts and condition she was absolutely igorant
> of. So at last the piai's heart became softened, and he determined on
> going to fetch his brother home again. It was all due to his
> "medicine" that his brother fell into the clutches of the Spirits. He
> told the old woman to pack up everything, because when he returned
> with his brother they and all their family would have to leave the
> place forever.
>
>    <span id="pp_6"></span>**6.**[\*](#pp_6.md) The night previous to
> their departure, he "played the *shak-shak*" (*i. e.*, called up his
> Spirit friends with the rattle), and next morning hosts of parrots
> were passing overhead. His children called his attention to them; so
> he went out and asked the birds to throw down a seed of a certain tree
> the bark of which he used medicinally. This they did, and though the
> youngeters saw the seed falling, directly it touched ground the father
> put his foot on it, and look as much as they could, the children could
> not find it. As he did not want them to know what he was doing, he
> told them that nothing had fallen, that they must be mistaken, and
> that they must run away now. Young folk are not allowed to see what
> the old medicine-men practise. When left alone, Hariwali planted the
> identical seed just where it had fallen, and that same evening <span
> id="page_122">p. 122</span> repeated the performance with the rattle;
> by next morning a stately tree had grown from that one seed. He told
> his mother to tie all the things which she had packed up, on the

>
>    <span id="pp_7"></span>**7.**[\*](#pp_7.md) It was not long before he
> reached the Yawahu's place, where, the family being away, he had no
> difficulty in releasing the captive, untying the bones from the roof,
> and making good his escape. Unfortunately the Spirit returned earlier
> than was expected, and seeing the empty hammock and no parcel of
> bones, was not long in concluding what had happened. He recognized the
> fresh tracks, and put his dogs on the scent. Poor Hariwali and his
> brother! They heard the barking of the dogs and the whistling of the
> Spirit, and barely had time to crawl into an armadillo hole. They just
> managed to get out of sight when Yawahu came up, threatening that if
> they did not come out, he would drive a stick into them; the fugitives
> laid low, and said nothing. Yawahu then shoved a stick in, but
> Hariwali touched it with his hand, and changed it into a bush-master
> snake. (This is why, even to the present day, a bush-master snake is
> always found in an armadillo hole.) At any rate, Yawahu on seeing the
> serpent thought he must have been mistaken in folowing the tracks and
> retraced his steps. Having put the bones back into his brother's skin,
> and waiting till the coast was clear, Hariwali led the way home.
>
>    <span id="pp_8"></span>**8.**[\*](#pp_8.md) And how glad their mother
> was to see them! She had everything packed away in and among the
> branches of the big tree, and she herself, her daughter, and the
> grandchildren were all prepared for a long journey. As night fell,
> they all, big and little, climbed up into the lower branches, finding
> shelter among the leaves while Hariwali made his way up to the very
> summit and began again the *shak-shak* performance. This continued
> till quite into the middle of the night, when all of a sudden, the
> family below felt the tree shaking, and heard rumbling noises,
> followed by a quivering, and experienced a sensation of the trunk
> being rooted out of the sand, and starting to fly up into the air.
> Now, it was just about the moment when they were off on their proposed
> journey that the old woman's daughter, the *piai's* sister, felt a bit
> chilly, and casting her eyes downward, remembered that she had left

> And they told Mayara-kóto not to go to Tiger's pond. The man, however,

> was very late when he came and quite dark. With him he brought not
> only Mayara-kóto's *waiyarri* (a temporary openwork basket made of

> come"), said he had brought some fish. Both women were astonished at

> mind him. The women cooked the fish. When cooked, and while the women

> and loudly—indeed, so loud that you could have heard him on the other
> side of the river. And while snoring, he called the father's
> name—Mayara-kóto. The two women looked at each other, and they
> listened. They said "Our husband never snored like that; he never
> called his own name before." They therefore stopped eating at once,
> and told each other that this man could not possibly be their husband.
> And they pondered as to how they were going to get Haburi out of the

>    <span id="pp_11"></span>**11.**[\*](#pp_11.md) While going along, they
> heard Wau-uta singing. Wau-uta was a woman in those days, indeed she

> (rattle). The two women went on and on, quickly too, for they knew
> that once they arrived at Wau-uta's place they would be safe. In the
> meantime, the Tiger-man woke up and found the bark bundle in his arms
> instead of little Haburi, and both the sisters gone. So he got angry;
> he changed back into his animal shape, and hurried after them. The
> women heard him coming and hurried still more. They called out
> "Wau-uta! open the door." "Who is there?" said Wau-uta, to which she

> But Wau-uta lied, telling that she had not seen them, that she had

>    <span id="pp_12"></span>**12.**[\*](#pp_12.md) In the meantime Wau-uta

>    <span id="pp_13"></span>**13.**[\*](#pp_13.md) Haburi was a splendid

> Haburi, however, did one day miss a bird for the first time, his arrow
> sticking into a branch overhanging a creek where his uncles, the

> here Haburi eased himself, covering the dung with leaves. He next
> climbed the tree to dislodge the arrow, but just then the water-dogs
> arrived, and, scenting the air, exclaimed, "What smell is this? That
> worthless nephew of ours, Haburi, must be somewhere about." So they
> looked around, and down, and up, and finally discovering him on the
> tree branch, ordered him to come down. They then sat him on a bench,
> and told him he was leading a bad life, that the old woman was not his
> mother, but that the two younger ones were his mother and aunt,
> respectively; they furthermore impressed upon him that it was very
> wicked of him to divide the birds so unfairly, and that in future he
> must do exactly the opposite, giving his real mother, the bigger of

>    <span id="pp_14"></span>**14.**[\*](#pp_14.md) So when Haburi got home

> *85*](aflg05.htm#pp_85).md), and told him he must be mad; so angered and
> upset was she that she could eat nothing at all. She spent all that

>    <span id="pp_15"></span>**15.**[\*](#pp_15.md) Haburi, therefore, made

> but, by next morning a black duck had taken it away. He therefore made
> another little clay corial, but this was stolen by another kind of
> duck. In the meantime he cut a large field, and cleared it so quickly

> required plenty of cassava for their proposed journey. At any rate,
> while the women planted, Haburi would often slip away and make a boat,
> always of a different kind of wood and of varying shape, and just as
> regularly would a different <span id="page_125">p. 125</span> species
> of duck come and steal it. At last he happened to make one out of the

>    <span id="pp_16"></span>**16.**[\*](#pp_16.md) But what was more

>
>    <span id="pp_17"></span>**17.**[\*](#pp_17.md) Wau-uta thereupon

   <span id="pp_18"></span>**18.**[\*](#pp_18.md) The tree-frog above
referred to is probably the *kono*(*bo*)-*aru*, or rain-frog, the name
given to the old woman in the Carib version of the story ([Sect.
*35*](aflg02.htm#pp_35).md). The croaking of this creature (*Hyla venulosa*
Daud.) is an absolutely sure sign of rain. This frog lives only in the
trunk of the *Bodelschwingia macrophylla* Klotzsch, a tree found on the
Pomeroon and Barama (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 419). Though
the Warraus are believed to have been the first of the Guiana Indians to
use boats, the invention of the sail has been credited to the Caribs. A
modern addition to the above version of the story is that Haburi sailed
away, found new lands, and taught the white people all their arts and
manufactures, all about guns and ships, and for many years used to send
his old Warrau friends certain presents annually, but they never come
now—an unscrupulous Government detains them in Georgetown!

   <span id="pp_19"></span>**19.**[\*](#pp_19.md) With regard to
Koroiomanna, or Kururumanni, the same remarks concerning his tribal
origin apply as in the case of Haburi. Hilhouse and Schomburgk (ScR,
<span class="small">II</span>, 319) seemingly would have him an Arawak,
but Brett undoubtedly makes him a Warrau, the view which <span
id="page_126">p. 126</span> is held by the present-day Warraus and
Arawaks on the Pomeroon. He is said to be the creator of the male
portion of mankind, another Spirit, Kulimina,<span
id="page_126_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_126_note_1.md) being responsible for
the female. Uri-Kaddo and Emeshi are his two wives, one name signifying
'darkness-people,' 'a worker in darkness,' and the other a large red ant
that burrows in the earth; "together, they are typical of the creation
of all things out of the earth in the dark" (HiC, 244). Kororomanna
would seem to have experienced a remarkable number and variety of
adventures some of which are given here.

the alleged God (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 225, 515) or
Supreme Being (IT, 365) of the Akawais, the Maker of Heaven and Earth
(ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 319) of the Makusis, was one of the
twin children of the Sun—in this particular all the traditions
concerning him are in agreement. He and his brother Pia may be regarded
as both Akawai and Makusi heroes. The name itself, Makunaima, signifies
"one that works in the dark" (HiC, 244); the Being working in opposition
to him, according to Makusi beliefs, is Epel (ScR, loc. cit.). I am
fortunately able to give three versions of the tradition of these
Heroes—from Warrau, Carib, and Makusi sources, respectively.

   <span id="pp_39"></span>**39.**[\*](#pp_39.md) In the story as told by a
Makusi (Da, 339), there are but a few main variations from the
particulars given by the Warraus ([Sect. *29*](aflg02.htm#pp_29).md). These
variations are as follows:

>    The Sun, finding his fish-ponds too frequently robbed, set Yamuru,
> the water-lizard, to watch them. Yamuru, not being sufficiently
> vigilant and deprivations continuing, Alligator was appointed
> watchman. Alligator, the depredator, continued his old trade while
> employed as a watchman, and at last was detected by the Sun, who
> slashed him with a cutlass within an inch of his life, every cut
> forming a scale ([Sect. *141*](aflg09.htm#pp_141).md). Alligator begged
> piteously for his life, and to propitiate the Sun offered him his
> beautiful daughter in marriage. But he had no daughter. He therefore
> sculptured the form of a woman from a wild plum tree. He then exposed
> her to the Sun's influence, and fearing ultimate detection of the
> fraud, hid himself in the water, peering at the Sun; and this habit
> Alligator has continued to the present time. The woman was imperfectly
> formed, but a woodpecker, in quest of food, pecked at her body atque
> genitalia preparavit. The Sun left her and she, grieving for his
> desertion, said that she would seek him. \[Then follows the incident
> of her advent at old Mother Toad's house, the sickness caused by
> eating the poisonous head-lice, the death of the woman, as in the
> Carib version, caused by Tiger, and the discovery of the two unborn
> children, who subsequently became the two Heroes.\]
>
>    <span id="pp_40"></span>**40.**[\*](#pp_40.md) Pia's first work was to
> slay Tiger and take out of his carcass the parts ot the body of his
> mother, who became whole and alive. \[Next comes a repetition of the
> Warrau legend concerning the old toad guarding her fire-making
> secret.\] But Makunaima had an appetite for fire-eating, and
> invariably devoured the live coals. The toad remonstrated, and
> Makunaima in anger prepared to leave and to travel throughout the

   Mount Zabang, the Olympus of the Makusis, is the dwelling their great
Spirit Makunaima (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 188).

   <span id="pp_42"></span>**42.**[\*](#pp_42.md) Amalivaca ([Sect.
*2*](aflg01.htm#pp_2).md), venerated by the Caribs and more especially by
the Tamanacs, is said to have arrived in a bark, during the subsidence
of the great waters, and carved the sculptures now seen high on the
perpendicular faces of the rocks which border the great rivers (Br,
387). He has a brother Vochi—together, they created the world. While
making the Orinoco they had a long consultation about causing the stream
to flow up and down at one and the same time, so as to ease the paddlers
as much as possible. Amalivaca had daughters who were very fond of
gadding about, so he broke their legs to render them sedentary, and
force them to people the land of the Tamanacs. He also did many other
things. He made the earth sufficiently level for people to dwell on. He
seems to have known music. His house, consisting of some blocks of stone
piled one on another, forming a sort of cavern, may still be seen on the
plains of Maita, and near it is a large stone which the Indians say "was
an instrument of music, the drum of Amalivaca" (AVH, <span
class="small">II</span>, 473). Strange to say, I can obtain no
information first-hand from the Pomeroon District Caribs concerning this
Amalivaca; even the name appears to be now unknown here.
