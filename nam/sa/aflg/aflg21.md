>    This is another crab story ([Sect. *278*](aflg16.htm#pp_278).md); but
> the hero of it was distinguished by his laziness, and not by his
> ignorance. A large party of people went out in a big boat to catch
> crabs: every one of them had twenty quakes aboard, and as they rested
> at each stopping-place, they still continued plaiting them. You see,
> they had nothing to distract their attention, having left their wives
> at home to make the paiwarri ready for their return. At one of the
> inlets where they put in for a rest on the way down, they saw growing
> close to the banks a small kokerite palm, with a large bunch of ripe
> fruit. Having cut off the bunch, they put it into the boat, shoved
> off, and then started eating. The hero of this story asked them to
> save all the seeds, after they had removed the fruity parts, and let
> him have them. This they did, and on the night before their arrival at
> the place agreed upon for catching crabs, he filled all his quakes
> with them. Next morning the others landed to hunt, but this fellow
> refused to join them, and remained in the boat, not even putting his
> feet into the water. He knew well enough how to hunt the crabs, but
> was too lazy, and counted on receiving contributions from all his
> companions. These, on the contrary, were equally determined that he
> should not have any: they filled all their own quakes, returned to the
> boat, and finally reached home. It was night when they got there, and
> they turned into their hammocks. Next morning, they called their wives
> to fetch the crabs from the place where they had left them at the
> water-side. The wife of the individual who had brought back the
> kokerite seeds, asked him where *his* crabs were: he told her that she
> would find them at the bottom of the heap and that she would have to
> wait until all the other women had cleared away theirs. She did as she
> was instructed and, carrying the quakes to her mother, let her know
> that these were the kind of crabs that her husband had brought home
> with him. The old woman thought much, but merely said, "Put them into
> a big pot and boil them on the fire, till the shells crack." In the
> meantime, each of the other women gave the naturally diaappointed wife
> one quakeful of crabs each, but conditionally, on her promising that
> she would give none to her husband. And thus, with one exception, they
> all started on a hearty meal of crabs and paiwarri. The old mother
> took a calabash full of the cooked kokerite seeds, and placing it
> before her good-for-nothing son-in-law, bade him eat. This was obliged
> to do, even if only out of mere shame, because he was so hungry, and
> knew that no one would give him of their crabs. At any rate, the
> lesson cured him of his laziness, and on the next occasion that he
> went out hunting, he brought home to his poor wife crabs and not
> kokerite seeds.

   I give the following almost word for word translation of the account
told me by an old Pomeroon Arawak; it is well worth comparing with
Brett's version ([BrB, 35](../lmbg/lmbg1b.htm#page_35).md):

>    An Arawak and a Carib were very friendly: this must needs be so,
> because each had taken the other's sister to wife. They regularly used
> to go hunting together. After living in harmony for a long time, they
> went out hunting, but on this occasion they did not go in company, and
> they both stayed away longer than usual, and their friends wefe
> beginning to wonder what had happened to them. The Arawak, having
> finally returned, went to see after his brother-in-law, followed his
> tracks into the bush, and came on the babracote upon which he found
> the dried body of his sister whom her husband had evidently killed. He
> went home, but did not speak for some time. He them told his wife, the
> Carib's sister, to come into the bush and hunt with him: when he got
> her away, he killed and babracoted her. The Carib next came along to
> see what had happened, and he soon saw. He also went home again, but
> did not speak for some time. Finally, he expressed a wish to fight and
> kill the Arawak, but the Nafudi said "No. All the Caribs together must
> fight the Arawaks together." So both sides cut a big field and planted
> plenty of the particular canes required for making arrows, and when
> these canes were full grown, they cut them down and completed their
> weapons, and both sides erected a strong house, Waiba, to store them
> in. Up at Jack Low, on the left bank of the Pomeroon, is still to be
> recognized the site of the old settlement and fortress, the place
> itself even to this day being known as Waiba-diki. Furthermore, it was
> arranged by both parties that as they intended fighting their battle
> at sea, and not on land, they would allow themselves time to build a
> large number of canoes. This being done, they filled their boats with
> arrows: twenty canoes were paddled by Arawaks, and forty by Caribs.
> They all went down the river, out to sea, at the Pomeroon mouth, each
> taking up such position as would permit of the intervening distance
> being just sufficient to allow of the arrows thrown from one side
> reaching the other. The Arawaks, however, were shrewd. They made
> themselves cork-wood shields \[*nonabokuanna*\].<span
> id="page_383_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_383_note_1.md) The Caribs let fly
> their arrows first, but these stuck in the shields, when the Arawaks
> broke them off with their *mossi*, the now almost obsolete club. None
> of the Arawaks were slain, and it was now their turn to shoot. This
> they did, with the result that they killed all their enemy, except
> two, whom they purposely spared in order that they might go home and
> tell their friends what had happened, and what to expect should they
> ever dare to fight the Arawaks again. The two who had been spared went
> away to the Cuyuni, to the Barima, and to the Waini, and remained
> three months gathering together all their people, who clamored that
> they would never rest until they had destroyed all the Arawaks. The
> Arawaks were waiting for them at Waiba-diki, their stronghold, and
> stretched a vine-rope across the river; and as the hosts of Caribs
> approached up the stream, the steering paddles of their canoes became
> entangled in this rope, and broke away; and while the occupants were
> looking after them, their canoes all tossed one against the other in
> dire confusion, and the Arawaks shot showers of arrows into the
> wavering multitude. Half the Caribs were destroyed; the other half
> effected a landing. But around their fortress, the Arawaks had already
> built a palisade, with just a few chinks in it to permit of arrows
> flying through; they were all well under cover, and though losing a
> few of their own people, massacred as before all their enemy, leaving
> but two to give the news to their friends. These two went to the east,
> to Surinam, and started collecting the remnants of their own tribe
> from those parts. <span id="page_384">p. 384</span> About three months
> passed. The Arawaks could wait no longer, so they traveled over to
> Surinam, and came upon the Carib forces, collected in a fortress with
> enclosing palisade, similar to what they themselves had constructed
> for their own preservation at Waiba-diki. The Caribs were in
> overwhelming numbers. So the Arawaks hid themselves, and sent in one
> of their number to reconnoiter. This man, who could talk Carib,
> painted himself like one of that nation, and boldly entered the
> enemy's camp, where he found them all drinking. He said he was a
> Carib, and that he had just come from the Pomeroon looking for his
> family; he accepted a little drink and then took his departure, but
> not before discovering that very early on the following morning, long
> before daybreak, a crab whistle (i. e. made from a crab claw) would be
> blown as a signal for them to prepare for battle. The scout returned
> to his people, with all the information that he had gleaned. That
> night, every one of the Arawaks made a crab whistle, and surrounding
> the Caribs while they were still drinking, blew their whistles,
> surprising the enemy, and slew them all, save one man and woman, who
> begged so earnestly for their lives that only their legs were speared.
> It is from this couple that all the present day Caribs are derived,
> and this is why there are comparatively so few of them. It was we
> Arawaks who broke their power.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_381">p. 381</span>

<span id="page_381_note_1"></span>[1](#page_381_fr_1.md) I am well aware of
the statement often made (for example, by Boddam-Whetham, p. 250; im
Thurn, p. 265) about Indians not eating birds' eggs; this, however,
applies only to eggs of domesticated birds, as noted by Schomburgk in
his visit to the Takutu (Sc.T. 70): "Fowls are the only animals which
the Indian of Guiana domesticates . . . ; but he raises them only for
his diversion, as he makes neither use of their eggs nor of their
flesh." Crévaux (164), in French Guiana, speaking of fowls and eggs,
says that these are not eaten by the Oyambis, nor by the Roucouyennes.
On his asking the chief for the reason, the latter told him that, in
spite of his advanced age, he still wished to have children and that the
eggs of all species of birds were preserved for the old people of both
sexes. I am given to understand that the aboriginal Guiana receipt for
cooking eggs is as follows: Break a number into a pot over the fire,
stir with a wooden spoon, add salt, when procurable, to taste, and then
serve.—W. E. R.

<span id="footnotes_page_382">p. 382</span>

<span id="page_382_note_1"></span>[1](#page_382_fr_1.md) The
*maraka-bakuru* is a small detached house, in which in the olden times
the Warru house-master would keep his arrows, clubs, tools, and
implements, and other knickknacks.

<span id="page_382_note_2"></span>[2](#page_382_fr_2.md) Any snag or tree
growing from out of the river-bed above the water is believed to have
been planted there by the Water People, or Ho-aranni ([Sect.
*177*](aflg12.htm#pp_177).md), and hence is given this name.

<span id="footnotes_page_383">p. 383</span>

<span id="page_383_note_1"></span>[1](#page_383_fr_1.md) Although we have
historical evidence of the use of shields from the Orinoco, Cayenne, and
the Amazon, this is the first reference that I have come across
concerning these weapons in British Guiana.—W. E. R.
