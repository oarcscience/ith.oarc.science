## C<span class="small">HAPTER</span> XIV OMENS, CHARMS, TALISMANS

   <span class="small">Omens, tokens, auguries, etc., dependent on—human
beings (*[220](#pp_220)-221*); quadrupeds (*[222](#pp_222)*.md); birds
(*[223](#pp_223)*); insects (*[224](#pp_224)-225*.md); plants
(*[226](#pp_226)*.md). Ordeals, Preparatory Charms, for the Chase, with:
Incisions, mutilations, nose-stringing (*[227](#pp_227)*.md); frogs, toads
(*[228](#pp_228)-229*); caterpillars and ants (*[230](#pp_230)*.md);
perhaps have a physiological basis (*[231](#pp_231)*.md). Hunting-dogs have
to undergo similar ordeals (*[232](#pp_232)*.md). Attraction charms, Binas
(1) for hunting: Plants, used on hunter (*[233](#pp_233)*.md), or on his
dog (*[234](#pp_234)*.md), originally obtained from a snake
(*[235](#pp_235)*.md). Animals used on the hunter and on his dog
(*[236](#pp_236)*); (2) for sexual purposes: Plants (*[237](#pp_237)*.md);
animals (*[238](#pp_238)*.md). Talismans, Repellent (and so Protective or
Defensive) Charms: Plant (*[239](#pp_239)*.md), animal, tooth
(*[240](#pp_240)*), blood and red paint (*[240A](#pp_240A)*.md), stone
(*[241](#pp_241)*.md).</span>

   <span id="pp_220"></span>**220.**[\*](#pp_220.md) Omens, tokens,
auguries, etc., are known to the Arawaks as *adibuahu*, to the Warraus
as *asijatai-ahá*. Lucky indeed are those children who are born with a
caul (*shibo-addahu*), because they are going to see spirits (Yawahu)
and so become more clever. If the husband is away fishing or hunting,
and any little child of his, boy or girl, takes up a pot, and puts it on
the fire pretending to cook something (leaves, etc.), the mother can
rest assured that their father is bringing something home with him. If a
healthy person is suddenly overcome by a sleepy feeling, or if during
sleep he happens to spit, this means that he is about to be visited by
some one (Arawaks). During sneezing and yawning, the spirit temporarily
leaves the body through nose and mouth (KG, <span
class="small">II</span>, 152). To point the finger at a fellow creature
([Sect. *263*](aflg15.htm#pp_263).md) is to offer him as serious an affront
as it would be to step over him when lying on the ground; in the latter
case, the recumbent person would rightly say, "You can cross me when I
am dead. I am not dead yet!" (Arawaks). Our old chieftain, says
Schomburgk, had during the morning sprained his foot, while jumping from
rock to rock, an accident to which he paid little attention, but which
showed he was unable to proceed on the journey to Nappi: this accident
was taken as a bad omen by both the Makusis and Arekunas who, with the
exception of those who were bound to us by agreement, all turned back to
their settlement on the following morning (ScR, <span
class="small">II</span>, 291). If the occupants of a settlement
\[Pomeroon Caribs\] wish to assure the victory for their warriors on the
march, and want to assure themselves at the same time of the issue of
the battle, perhaps already fought, they place two boys on a bench and
whip them without mercy, especially over the shoulders. If the boys bear
the pain without shedding a tear or uttering a groan, victory is
certain. One of the boys is then placed in a hammock, from which he has
to shoot at a target fixed to one of the roofs: as many arrows <span
id="page_272">p. 272</span> as hit the target, so many of the enemy will
be killed by the warriors (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 431). If
after their descent upon the Arawaks, they are discovered before
striking the first blow, or a dog yelps at them, the Island Caribs take
the incident for a bad augury, and return to their boats; they believe
that hostilities, begun openly, will not succeed (RoP, 529).

   <span id="pp_221"></span>**221.**[\*](#pp_221.md) As a matter of fact,
anything that occurs out of the ordinary is accepted in the light of a
token of something evil about to happen. For examples of this, I am
taking at random the following extracts from the legends already given:

> killing it, so *it promptly crawled out*; they pushed it on again, but

>    And when asked how she knew \[that the Bush Spirits were coming to

>    When the husband *claimed the beast which he had not killed, as his

   <span id="pp_221A"></span>**221A.**[\*](#pp_221A.md) The token or augury
may be in the nature of an indescribable sort of feeling.

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

   <span id="pp_222"></span>**222.**[\*](#pp_222.md) With regard to
animals, let us see what they or their actions can presage.

   Serious sickness or death is indicated by either small or large
species of armadillo (yeshi and monoraima, respectively), of the jaguar,
burrowing or digging up, for the purpose of covering its excreta, any
portion of the road leading up to the house. Similarly it is a bad omen
for any droppings of the buhürri (a bat) to be found on the pathway
(Arawaks). There is a frog with a spotted back which jumps well, and is
known to the Pomeroon Arawaks as sorukara. A pregnant woman will tickle
it to make it jump, and according as it lands on its back or its belly,
so will her child prove to be girl or boy. The Island Caribs regarded
bats as their guardian Chemeens or Familiar Spirits, and believed that
whoever killed them would become ill (BBR, 235). When the warritimakáro
(*Bradypus tridactylus*), the smallest kind of sloth, which has a
curious habit of always covering its face with its crossed hands,
uncovers its face, it is a sure token that some one is going to die
(Arawaks).

   <span id="pp_223"></span>**223.**[\*](#pp_223.md) Birds of ill omen are
present in plenty. Chief among these is the goat-sucker (*Caprimulgus*).
Writing from the Takutu, Schomburgk says that—

>    The Indians have the greatest superstition with regard to this
> bird, and would not kill it for any price. They say it keeps
> communication with the dead, and brings messages to their conjurers.
> Even the common people on the coast retain in a great measure this
> superstition, and hold the bird in great awe. Its nocturnal habits,
> the swiftness and peculiarity of its flight, and its note, which
> breaks the silence of the night, have no doubt contributed to the fear
> which Indians and Creoles entertain for the Wacarai or Sumpy Bird
> \[ScT, 67\].

   As is the case with even far more civilized nations, owls are of
equally evil portent and may indicate sickness, death, the presence of
an as-yet-unborn babe, or a birth. Thus, among the Pomeroon and Moruca
Arawaks, the boku-boku, and the waro-baiya or maletitoro (both of them
species of night-owl), and among the Demerara River Arawaks, the hututu
(night-owl) and makudi (small owl) are said always to be heard when a
person is sick or about to die. In the Pomeroon the morokodyi
(night-owl) cries when a female in the house is enciente. On the
Demerara, when the night-owl calls *cuta! cuta! cuta!* quickly, it is to
notify that one in the family is about to give birth to a child; and
when that bird mews like a cat, it is the notification of death (Da,
269). In French Guiana, on the upper Parou River, at an Apaläi vinage,
Crévaux had a curious experience: "Arrived in the forest where we
proposed camping, we heard the notes of a bird which I have reason to
believe is a kind of screech-owl. A panic seized my escort, the torches
were put out, and men and women saved themselves in the obscurity of the
night. We were obliged to return to the village for our night's rest"
(Cr, 300). On the Pomeroon <span id="page_275">p. 275</span> and
elsewhere, probably from their custom, when in large numbers, of flying
in pairs, one behind the other, the baridi hawks are taken as an omen of
a funeral. On the lower Amazon, a black eagle (*Milvago nudicollis*)
locally known as the caracára-i, is considered a bird of ill-omen by the
Indians; it often perches on the tops of trees in the neighborhood of
their huts and is then said to bring a warning of death to some member
of the household. Some say that its whining cry is intended to attract
defenceless birds within its reach (HWB, 146). With regard to remaining
species of birds, the Pomeroon Arawaks believe that if the koko-bero
flies over the house, some one in it will shortly prove pregnant, that
or a little baby is about to be taken sick. The voice of the kwa-kwarra
brings an evil message, similar to that of the boku-boku. The
karéo-obannahu is a small night-bird, so named after its note, *karau!
karau!* and *obannahu* (the liver, the color of which it resembles). If
its note is heard but faintly, some individual must be exceedingly ill:
if distinctly, the patient is getting better and stronger. When the
beletika cries, some one is about to be married; hence this token may be
both of good and bad omen. Another set of bird-tokens may indicate
approaching rainfall as well as accident ([Sect.
*217*](aflg13.htm#pp_217).md). There is still another class of omens,
indicative of either prospective good luck or bad luck. Thus, when on a
hunting expedition, one hears the karrasuri, a small bird, uttering a
kind of laugh, he is sure to kill something, but if it should cry
*shirai*, he will get nothing. According as the bukulaura, another bird,
turns its back or its breast toward a person, so will fortune or
misfortune attend that person's wishes in obtaining whatever food he
wants. \[Furthermore, when walking along the pathway one must not mind
if a munirikuti (species of black ant) bites his foot, because this
means that he will obtain something very good and satisfying.\] Some
Indians will never turn their back on a trogon: "He \[the Indian\]
attributed his safety (from drowning) to the strictness with which the
Indians had observed the proper respect due to a trogon that had flown
over our heads in the morning: they have a superstition that if, on
setting out on a journey, they should turn their backs to this species
of bird, ill luck will surely follow." (BW, 146: on the Mazaruni, with
an Arawak and Akawai crew.) The following are some miscellaneous
examples of bird-omens: On the Pomeroon one must not gaze too long on
the great red macaw, unless the individual wishes to become bald,
presumably in view of the bird having its cheeks so markedly devoid of
feathers. The advent of strangers is notified by the warracabba
(trumpeter-bird) when it is seen playing about near the house, having in
its mouth a leaf with which it is believed to be building a banab. On
the Orinoco, in token of the Father coming to visit them, the Cacique
said that on the previous day he had seen a bird with peculiar feathers
and colors passing over his house: it gave <span id="page_276">p.
276</span> them notice of his approach (G, <span class="small">I</span>,
311). Children are discouraged from picking up certain feathers, as
these tend to weaken memory, and the handling of the feathers of a
scissor-tail hawk, called by the Atorais *chaouneh*, conduces to
insanity (Da, 250).

   <span id="pp_224"></span>**224.**[\*](#pp_224.md) There are two bees
which indicate the arrival of a stranger. One of these insects
(honorari) comes in the morning early, and in the afternoon late, while
the other (wariro) lives in the ground; when either of these buzzes
Arawaks are convinced that people are about to visit them. The modudu is
another bee that flies round <span id="page_277">p. 277</span> somewhere
between 4 and 5 a. m.: should a young person hear it buzzing he (or she)
must immediately get out of the hammock, on penalty of having pains all
over the body. The Arawaks of the Pomeroon believe that if a candle fly,
*Pyrophorus noctilucus* (koko-i) is seen coming into the house, it may
mean three things: supposing it falls to the ground, this indicates the
near death of one of the inmates; if it falls into the fire, this shows
that a deer has sent it along to fetch a light for him; but if it
settles down under the roof, the arrival of a stranger is to be
expected. The bite of a certain ant is lucky ([Sect.
*223*](aflg14.htm#pp_223).md).

   <span id="pp_226"></span>**226.**[\*](#pp_226.md) The only example of
plant-life in connection with omens and auguries so far met with is that
recorded by Bernau: "Marriage is frequently contracted by parents for
their children when infants; and trees are planted by the respective
parties in witness thereof: it is considered a bad omen if either tree
should happen to wither as in that case the party is sure to die" (Be,
59).

   <span id="pp_227"></span>**227.**[\*](#pp_227.md) The Guiana Indian
voluntarily submits to various painful ordeals or preparatory charms,
previous to setting out on, and with the object of winning success in,
the chase. He believes in priming himself whenever his hunting powers
appear to be impaired, and may spend some two or three months or more in
the process; during this period he abstains from salt and peppers, also
perhaps from sugar. The ordeals apparently consist in the "mortification
of the flesh" by scarification, etc., and its irritation with various
frogs, toads, caterpillars, ants, or by special nose-stringing
apparatus. I purposely use the term "apparently" because their real
signification <span id="page_278">p. 278</span> (see [Sect.
*231*](aflg14.htm#pp_231).md) is evidently not even known to the Indians
who practise them. In Surinam, among both the Ojanas (Caribs) and Trios
(Caribs) it is customary (Go, 21) to slash arms and legs with a knife,
and the scars may be rubbed perhaps with turalla (Caladium bulb). An
Ojana told de Goeje that he cut his arm in order to be able to shoot the
quatta monkey well. A Trio slashed his arm and forearm and rubbed earth
into it, to become a good hunter; another cut his thigh in order to
become a strong mountain climber; some women also had on the outer side
of the thigh scars from wounds inflicted to make themselves strong. With
the Island Caribs, the forehead and nose were flattened artificially
(RoP, 437). This was done as soon as the infants were born by exerting
pressure in such a way as to cause a slight backward slope of this part
of the head. Besides being considered a sign of beauty, this shape was
said to be advantageous in shooting arrows from a tree-top, in securing
a foot-hold, etc. (RoP, 552). Among the Yaruro Indians of the Orinoco,
in order to become skillful with the bow and arrow the men submit to a
sexual mutilation with a sting-ray "barb", which is made to pierce the
prepuce (Cr, 570). The Cayenne Caribs never go on a big hunting
expedition without drawing a little blood from their arms to prevent
them shaking when pulling the bow: to give them greater strength for
paddling, the young men scarified themselves on both arms. Similarly,
before undertaking a journey on land they never fail to make incisions
at the level of the calves (Cr, 280). Schomburgk reports seeing Indians
bleeding each other as a remedy for over fatigue (ScF, 235). There is
still a nose-stringing procedure to be mentioned: "In most Indian houses
pieces of thick roughly-plated fiber or cord, as thick as codline, and a
yard in length, are seen hanging up in the roof. These have all been
used once . . . that is, passed up through the nose of the owner of the
house, and drawn out by the mouth, for the purpose of giving him good
luck in hunting" (Bro, 302). The string tapers "from a very small point
at one end to a considerable thickness at the other end, where the
fibers hang loosely in a bunch . . . the thin end \[is passed\] up his
nostril . . . employed by Makusis, Arecunas, and Ackawoi" (IT, 228). The
"exercising" of the limbs at each new moon may perhaps be regarded in
the light of a preparatory ordeal ([Sect. *199*](aflg13.htm#pp_199).md).

   <span id="pp_228"></span>**228.**[\*](#pp_228.md) In British Guiana, on
the Kaieteur savannah, a frog is rubbed on the transverse cuts made
adown either side of the hunter's chest, a different frog being used for
different game. In the same district a small live toad is said to be
swallowed for the promotion of general success in hunting.<span
id="page_278_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_278_note_1.md) "Having scratched his
wrist with the telson or sting of a scorpion to insure precision in
darting the arrow from the bow, and cut his arms and legs with the
flakes of a broken bottle, he <span id="page_279">p. 279</span> rubs the
back of the kunaua toad over the wounds; the virus of the reptile burns
like fire" (Da, 253). In the Pomeroon District, in addition to
abstention from salt and peppers, cuts are made on the arms, and the
spawn of the akura frog ([Sect. *229*](aflg14.htm#pp_229).md) is rubbed not
only into the incisions, but also into the mouth, nose, eyes, and ears,
where it is said to cause acute irritation. It is difficult to
understand the relationship, if any, between the frog or toad, and
success in the chase ([Sect. *144*](aflg09.htm#pp_144).md), except on a
basis of some original belief in the divinity ([Sect.
*46*](aflg03.htm#pp_46).md) of these batrachians, as we know to have
existed in other parts of the Guianas ([Sect.
*349*](aflg19.htm#pp_349).md). The following is an Arawak story:

   <span id="pp_230"></span>**230.**[\*](#pp_230.md) In the Pomeroon
District a hairy caterpillar may be rubbed into incisions made on the
wrists and thighs. This creature, obtained on the Rupununi and brought
down here in barter, is said to be soaked in water the whole of the
night previous to the solution being applied, by means of cotton-wool,
to the cuts. I have also seen a Pomeroon Arawak wear one on his neck. Im
Thurn (230) speaks of caterpillars "the hairs of which break off very
readily, and have a great power of irritating flesh. These caterpillars
he rubs on his <span id="page_280">p. 280</span> chest or thighs, and
thus produces a considerable and very painful-looking rash." This method
employed by Makusis, Arekunas, and Akawais. Or the hunter may mortify
his flesh with ants, a practice indulged in by a member of any of these
three tribes who—

>    Takes a small mat, about six or eight inches square, made of narrow
> parallel strips of the skin of a reed-like plant \[*Ischnosiphon*\]
> tied together somewhat as are the laths of a Venetian blind. Between
> each two of these strips he inserts a row of living ants, their heads
> all one way. The strips are exactly at such distance apart that the
> ants when once inserted can not extricate themselves. The huntsman
> then presses the whole mat, on the side on which are the heads of the
> ants, against his own chest; and the ants, which are of a large and
> venomous kind, bite most painfully." \[IT, 229.\]

   <span id="pp_231"></span>**231.**[\*](#pp_231.md) While recovering from
the effects of his self-inflicted cuts and other injuries, the Carib and
Akawai nimrod may be waited upon and nursed by some woman, but she must
be past the climacteric; he is strictly forbidden to take liberties with
any female. Though, at first sight, the inconvenience and suffering
entailed by certain of the above procedures might seem to constitute a
sort of sacrifice or free gift for favors to come, or at all events
expected, I am afraid all the evidence is in the negative. On the other
hand these practices may have a physiological basis of fact, and so of
reason. The passing of the nose-string would certainly tend to clean the
nasal mucus membrane, and so render the olfactory organ more keen; the
prohibition of women combined with an enforced diet would certainly tend
to make the individual more fit and thus get him into better training;
the stimulation of all his sense organs with the particular frog slime
may possibly hypersensitize them: while the infliction of physical pain
within certain limits can reasonably be expected to irritate the nervous
system to such an extent as to render it responsive to but the slightest
external stimulus—qualities, all of them, advantageous for the hunter to
insure success in the chase. It is perhaps on somewhat similar lines
that, with a view to stimulating the child quickly to learn to walk, the
Arawak mother will get a tibi-tibi lizard and encourage it to "bite the
infant's feet and knees; the child is also incited to activity by
putting a small stinging ant on him (Da, 250). But it is certainly
difficult to understand how the artificial flattening of the children's
foreheads by the Carib Island mothers can be vindicated in the belief
that it helps the victims in years to come the better to fly their
arrows from the tree-tops by securing firm foot-hold for them (RoP,
552).

   <span id="pp_232"></span>**232.**[\*](#pp_232.md) Hunting dogs are also
made to undergo similar ordeals, but whether as part and parcel, or
independent, of their general training ([Sect.
*234*](aflg14.htm#pp_234).md) it is difficult to say. On the Pomeroon in
addition to, or in lieu of, the rubbing of a leaf ([Sect.
*233*](aflg14.htm#pp_233).md) the animal's snout may be rubbed with a
certain tree-bark peculiar in that, when squeezed in the hands, a sort
of frothiness exudes \[? a species of *Inga*\]. Or <span
id="page_281">p. 281</span> again, the Pomeroon Indian will gash the
snout with a sting-ray barb and pour on the raw surface a few drops of a
solution made as follows: Some of the hot test kind of peppers are
squeezed into a swab of cotton already moistened with a little water; a
sugar-loaf funnel is then made of a suitable leaf, the cotton swab
expressed into it, and a few drops allowed to trickle down through the
funnel on the incisions. It is said that in two or three days' time the
animal is ready to hunt, and when on the chase will keep his nose close
to the ground, this action allowing of all grass and undergrowth being
well turned over and scoured. Ants are also sometimes made to bite the
creature's snout; or the same hairy caterpillar previously mentioned
([Sect. *230*](aflg14.htm#pp_230).md) is rubbed into it. There is reported,
however, an equally painful method as practised by the Makusi, Arekunas,
and Akawaios.

   <span id="pp_233"></span>**233.**[\*](#pp_233.md) Bínas are charms,
plant or animal, which effect their purpose by enticing or attracting
the particular object or desire yearned for, whatever it may be—from the
capture of an animal to the gratification of a wish. The real source of
the term *bín-a* is from the Arawak *bia-bina*, meaning "to entice,
attract," etc., and so comes to be applied to all those things, plant or
animal, which act on those lines. I have found nothing of this nature in
the inorganic world, unless the quartz-pebbles within the piai's rattle
are to be considered such. As against this view, it might be urged that
the medicine-man's tobacco-smoke constitutes the real or at least
co-equal attraction for the Spirits ([Sect. *170*](aflg10.htm#pp_170).md).
Im Thurn is certainly incorrect in speaking of the word being of Carib
origin. As a matter of fact, the Carib term is *turallári*; for example,
the Caribs speak of the bush-hog bina as ponjo-turallari. The Warrau
word is *aibihi*; for instance, toma-aibihi means the bina for meat, in
general. As a rule there is but one bina for each special object or
thing, but not necessarily. I know of one that is employed for small
hog, deer, and acouri; and with very few exceptions, the plants employed
as binas are the different varieties of caladium. Indian huntsmen place
great value on the use of the caladia, each variety being a bina or
charm to assist in the taking of a particular kind of game. Not only do
these plants grow spontaneously in old fields, but the Indians carefully
remove and plant in the immediate neighborhood of their dwellings the
most valued kinds, as the binas for tapir, wild hogs, deer, labbas,
turtle, and those for the various <span id="page_282">p. 282</span>
kinds of fish (Da, 253). As a rule, women are supposed neither to see
nor to handle such plants thus cultivated. Even in so comparatively
civilized a district as the Pomeroon and Moruca, I have collected more
than a score of such plants, the respective leaves of which in the
majority of cases bear some real or fancied resemblance to the animal
for which they are reputed to have so peculiar an affinity. Thus the
bush-hog bina has a leaf easily recognizable by the small secondary leaf
on its under surface, representing the animal's scent-gland, though some
Indians say that it indicates the tip of the nostril; the deer bina
shows the horns, in its general contour, and the coloration of the fur
in its venation; the armadilio bina typifies the shape of the small
projecting ears; the lukunanni bina bears a variety of colors resembling
those around the fish's gills; the gillbacker bina develops the same
yellowish color as the fish which it attracts; the labba bina has the
typical white markings; the powis bina bears the identical shape of that
bird's wing-feather—and so on for turtle, huri, etc. Some of these binas
seemingly must be of comparatively widespread use; thus, that for the
bush-hog is known in the Makusi country, those for the turtle, and
armadilio, in Surinam (J. Rodway), etc.

   The hunter puts the particular plant to use by taking off a young
as-yet-unopened shoot, and placing it, in the rough, in his
powder-flask, or rubbing it up into the paint, with which he smears his
face and body, but especially all the main joints; or, on the other
hand, he may employ only the leaf, which he rubs on his arrow, his
fish-hook, his gun-barrel; or on his dog. In Cayenne, these binas (*des
herbes enchanteresses*) are said to have been hung up on the trees (LAP,
<span class="small">II</span>, 221).

   <span id="pp_234"></span>**234.**[\*](#pp_234.md) In Cayenne, the dog
was also rubbed with "simples," for which procedure Pitou gives the
negative reason, "so that the game should not take itself off on its
approach" (LAP, <span class="small">II</span>, 220). The Roucouyennes, a
Carib nation of the same colony, cuitivate in their clearings the
*Hibiscus abelmoschus*, from which they make a musk-scented infusion for
washing their dogs before taking them to hunt jaguar (Cr, 330): this,
however, has nothing to do with the binas, the object of its application
being to prevent the tiger biting the dog, owing to the pungency of the
smell. Hunting dogs are also rubbed over with ruku (*Bixa orellana*)
both by Indians (Trios, Ojanas, and others) and Bush Negroes (Go, 3): in
British Guiana the practice said to keep off certain ticks (Ki, 184).
The methods adopted by the Corentyn Arawaks for "training" ([Sect.
*232*](aflg14.htm#pp_232).md) their dogs to hunt may be included here.
While the procedure may be correctly given, the statements relative to
the naming of the particular leaf after the animal which feeds on it and
the alleged odor are of course imaginative. These Arawaks first choose
the dogs for hunting various animals, according to strength, having
<span id="page_283">p. 283</span> each one broken for hunting a
different species of game; taking the largest for the wild hog, and the
smaller ones for the smaller animals. When about six months old they are
taken to the hunt with their sires, having previously gone through the
process of being washed and rubbed over with a particular leaf named
after the animal which feeds on it, and which the dog is intended to
hunt; and it is curious that these leaves should partake of the odor of
the animal. The game being discovered, the young dog is taken forward,
and set on him; but he generally turns tail for the few first times, as
this breed is naturally without spirit. He is then taken up, and again
goes through the same process of washing and rubbing with the leaf; and
at length he is treated to a piece of the animal's flesh, which

makes him more keen and ravenous. In this manner, exerting patience, of
which these Indians have a most abundant stock, and seldom correcting
the animal, it becomes in time a reliable and valuable dog (StC, <span
class="small">I</span>, 315). The method sometimes used by the Záparo
Indians of the Napo River (upper Amazon) in training their celebrated
hunting-dogs consists in putting a dose of tobacco down the animal's
throat, his nose and mouth being then also stuffed full of it, until he
nearly chokes; this is to clear his scent and sharpen his perceptions
(AS, 169).

   <span id="pp_235"></span>**235.**[\*](#pp_235.md) Old Caribs, Warraus,
and Arawaks of the Pomeroon and Moruca Rivers agree in telling me that
they originally obtained their hunting binas—they are not so sure about
the binas employed for other purposes—from certain very large snakes,
which are invariably to be met with only in localities so far distant
from the source of information as to preclude the possibility of my ever
obtaining specimens. The Caribs refer me to two snakes, the Orupéri
([Sect. *3*](aflg02.htm#pp_3)) and the Aramári ([fig. 2](#p283).md). The
former lives on the ground, beyond the Waini and the Barima. The latter,
which is much the bigger, lives in the tops of trees and catches its
prey by pouncing upon it from above: it <span id="page_284">p.
284</span> is also the more dangerous because from it can be obtained
binas which, in addition to attracting all kinds of game, can attract
thunder, lightning, and rain. The Warraus admit that almost all they
know about the binas has been taught them by the Akawais and Caribs. The
Arawak serpent is known as Oroli ([Sect. *363*](aflg20.htm#pp_363).md), or,
on account of its rate of progression, Kolekonáro (the slow walker). The
traditions of all three tribes agree in that, after having been killed,
the snake was carefully burnt, and that from the ashes there
subsequently arose all the different plants, mostly, but not all of
them, caladiums, which are now employed as binas ([Sect.
*168A*](aflg10.htm#pp_168A).md). The Arawaks say that—

>    A long time ago people noticed how every now and again one of their
> friends would leave his house, go into the forest, and never be seen
> more, They accordingly made up a big party, and tracked the latest

> carcass was then covered with bushes and saplings, and set fire to; as
> already mentioned the binas all grew out of the ashes.

   How the special efficacy of each bina was originally discovered has
been explained to me somewhat on the following lines: Trial would daily
be made of one plant after the other. Taking, for instance, Plant No. 1:
On the first day, the hunter might come across a tiger. A plant that
enticed or attracted such an animal would certainly be of no use to him,
and would accordingly be discarded. Another day, he might try Plant No.
2, and run across a snake; that plant also could be cast aside. If on
the other hand, with Plant No. 3 he were to fall in with some
scrub-turkey or similar game, he would reserve that plant for future
use—and so on with each animal or bird of economic value. But of course
nowadays since they know of and cultivate these different plants around
their houses, such trials are not necessary; they are quite aware what
particular plant will specially attract some particular animal.

   <span id="pp_236"></span>**236.**[\*](#pp_236.md) Corresponding animal
binas for attracting game must be somewhat scarce: I have succeeded in
obtaining only the following examples. When Arawaks on the Pomeroon kill
a bush-hog which happens to contain young, they bury the latter under
the house in a spot below the place where the cassava is usually grated,
the idea being that other bush-hogs may come near the house to the spot
whither the young are calling them. So among the Uaupes River Indians,
when they kill a bush-hog they bury the head at the spot where they
first met the band, so that the latter may not stray away but return
<span id="page_285">p. 285</span> there (Cou, <span
class="small">II</span>, 171). If a fisherman \[Pomeroon Arawaks\] has
been unlucky, and finally catches any little fish, he will take it off
the hook and, blowing into its mouth, say: "I will let you go again, if
you tell your friends, the bigger fish, to come." Of course it tells
them, and the fisherman's luck is rewarded. But the little fish is not
given its liberty again as promised, for the Indians say that if they
returned it to the water, it would tell its friends not to bite at the
hook. There are three such fish that are thus supposed to act as binas:
the wé-shi (*Crenicichla saxatilis*), "sun-frsh," the shiballi
(*Acara*); "patwa,"—and the hura-diro (? *Eigenmannia lineatus*), a fish
12 to 14 inches long, but of which the long thin tall constitutes a good
third. Similar ideas underlie a procedure reported from Caracas: "When
an Indian slays a wild beast, he opens its mouth, and pours down its
throat some intoxicating liquor, in order that its soul \[Spirit\] may
inform others of a similar species of the kind reception it received,
and that they may be encouraged to come and share the same favor" (FD,
52).

   Game, however, can be attracted to the hunting-dog. There is a
certain ant (kudu-kudu-barilya of the Arawaks) which, after being
roasted, is put inside a piece of cassava, and given to a dog to make it
a good hunter of any animal; the dog is simultaneously trained to go
into wood-holes and earth-holes by having its food placed inside a
cassava-squeezer.

   <span id="pp_237"></span>**237.**[\*](#pp_237.md) The next class of
binas deals with phases of the sexual question: conjugal rights, mutual
love and affection, and babies. Where plants take the title rôles, these
are again mostly caladia. Arawak, Warrau, Akawai, and Carib women all
have their own binas for managing the opposite sex. The Arawak young
woman plants her hiaro (girl)-bina usually in some secluded spot known
only to herself; she will bathe with a leaf of it, or carry it about
with her, and, provided the opportunity offers, without her being seen,
may rub it over her lover's hammock, or she may rub her own hands with
it, and then touch his. In any case, the man must be ignorant of what is
going on, and, provided the procedure is strictly carried out as
described, he will never have any desire to transfer his affections
elsewhere. Again, the same woman may employ another plant, not a
caladium, called the kurua-bina, apparently a Rajania of the Yam family;
she will similarly bathe with the leaf, but retaining the water in which
she has thus made her ablutions, will strew it on the path along which
her sweetheart is about to travel, tening it to make him return soon.
The male Arawak has a corresponding belief as to the wajíli (man)-bina,
the leaf of which he generally carries about with the object of brushing
over his girl's face or shoulders: he is very intent on going through
this performance when he notices that she has a weakness for other men.
Other peoples (as the Caribs) have <span id="page_286">p. 286</span>
similar practices, I know of three plants that are used by these people
on the Pomeroon. Wai-áru: squeeze and pinch up a leaf or two in water,
rub one's self now with the leaf, and throw the water just used in the
direction of the person desired, at the same time calling his (or her)
name. Wamba: used by the father for an absent elder son, or by the
mother for an absent elder daughter; take a leaf with you in your
hammock and call the boy's or girl's name. Akámi: when a person has come
with the object of picking a quarrel, rub the leaf over one's head and
face: it will make him quite amicable and friendly. So also among the
Surinam Kaliñas (Caribs) de Goeje tells us that to evoke affection, one
rubs the hands and face with turalla (Go, 14, 15): a woman, for
instance, can do this when her man is away traveling, so that he may not
forget her. When an Arawak or Warrau woman is desirous of having a baby,
and none happens to appear in the natural course of things, she pounds
up in water a certain fungus, and drinks the infusion. As I have shown
elsewhere, the absence of a boy is a slur on the Indian's womanhood and
entails many opprobrious epithets. The fungus in question, a species of
Nidularia, is known to the Arewak as Kassato-lokono-biabina (lit.,
"baby-plenty charm"), or, in its shortened form, as Kassa-lo-bina, These
women here never eat of a "double-fruit" which would mean twins for them
([Sect. *284A*](aflg16.htm#pp_284A).md).

   <span id="pp_238"></span>**238.**[\*](#pp_238.md) There are certain
animal binas corresponding in their action with the plant binas just
mentioned in connection with sexual matters. Among the Pomeroon Arawaks,
when the husband is very jealous and ill-tempered, his wife will cut off
the head of a small lizard (yamorro), burn it, and put the ashes into
the water which she gives him to drink; any man or woman can then make
the husband do whatever he or she likes. When one woman wants another's
husband she will manage to put marabunta (wasp) eggs into his drink,
which will make him leave his own wife and go off with her (the eggs are
pounded up and roasted before mixing). On the upper Amazons, the native
women, even the white and half-caste inhabitants of the towns, attach
superstitious value to the skin and feathers of the papá-uira, believing
that the relics will have the effect of attracting for the happy
possessors a train of lovers and followers \[The Indians have noticed
these miscellaneous hunting parties of birds, but appeared not to have
observed that they are occupied in searching for insects. They have
supplied their want of knowledge . . . by a theory which has degenerated
into a myth to the effect that the onward moving bands are led by a
little gray bird called the papá-uirá, which fascinates all the rest and
leads them a weary dance through the thickets. There is certainly some
appearance of truth in this explanation; for sometimes stray birds
encountered in the line of march are seen to be drawn into the throng,
and purely frugiverous birds are now and then found mixed up with the
rest, as though led away by some will-of-the-wisp (HWB, 346).\] When it
is known to her intimate friends and relatives that an Arawak woman
wants an infant, they will give her to drink of a mixture, in which,
unknown to her, they have placed the roasted and pulverized remains of
either a cockroach (matero), the eggs of a certain spider, or the paw of
an opossum (yawarri).

   <span id="pp_239"></span>**239.**[\*](#pp_239.md) Talismans, the last
group of charms to be dealt with, include those which repel evil, bad
luck, and the like, and so have a protective or defensive
character—those which endow the Indian with such superior advantages of
body and estate as enable him to get the better of his fellow-creatures,
human and animal. Matters of courage, health and strength, power to
withstand sickness and his enemies, craft to excel in the chase, trade
and barter, all find a place here. With regard to the chase, the
provisions mentioned in [Sect *243*](aflg15.htm#pp_243.md) might very
reasonably be regarded as talismanic. Among the Trios (Caribs) of
Surinam, says de Goeje—

>    We saw afresh how one of our party rubbed the palms of his hands
> with turalla \[caladiuim bulb\] on arrival at a village of which they
> had much dread. A young man on the journey through the forest carried
> siinti \[turalla\] in a little palm-leaf box attached to the neck, in
> order to strengthen his head and shoulders. A child with fever was one
> afternoon washed by its mother with water into which finely ground
> siinti had been placed. As after two days, the fever again appeared,
> it was streaked with ruku paint, with which the same stuff had been
> mixed. \[Go, 14-15.\]

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

   De Goeje states also that when making a purchase, the buyer will take
a little turalla between his lips to prevent the seller overreaching
him. According to Schomburgk (ScF, 215), the Maiongkongs used for
necklaces a bunch of the slender stems of a cryptogamous plant, a fern
called *Zinapipo* by them, to which they ascribed talismanic property.

teeth or bush-hog teeth will preserve him, when he grows up, from being
attacked by wild beasts \[Uaupes River\] (Cou, <span
class="small">II</span>, 171). Makusi women and children wear round
their necks tigers' teeth, to which they ascribe talismanic power (ScT,
61; ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 83). On the Berbice the sticks
cut down by the sawyer beetle are given by the Indians to children
cutting teeth, to rub their gums with, under the impression that as a
result the teeth will grow strong and sharp (Da, 15). With the Indians
of the upper Napo River (Amazons) bracelets and armlets of iguana skin
are much affected, as in some parts of Central America, with the same
association of their imparting bravery and pugnacity to the wearer (AS,
154). To obtain sharp vision, a Kobeua Indian will rub his eyes with
those of a certain falcon (KG, <span class="small">II</span>, 153). The
Caribs and almost all other Indians ascribe talismanic powers to the
large teeth of an alligator (ScA, 336). West of the Orinoco alligator
teeth are employed by the Indians as an ornament for the neck and arms;
they are also regarded as an antidote for certain poisons, and as an
alexipharmic in general (FD, 151). As an antidote for poison, within the
Orinoco area, Gumilla speaks of alligator teeth mounted in gold or
silver and tied by a small chain on one of the arms or <span
id="page_290">p. 290</span> made up into rings worn on the fingers; but
this would appear to be a discovery learned from the negro slaves (G,
<span class="small">II</span>, 225).

   <span id="pp_240A"></span>**240A.**[\*](#pp_240A.md) The application of
red paint was sometimes considered a talisman against sickness and
disease. Thus, among the Makusis of the Rupunini the mothers
ceremonially rub red (aromatic) paint on the heads of their children,
who are then supposed to be protected from illness and the power of Evil
Spirits (ScR, <span class="small">I</span>, 366). The men \[Guahibos of
the Vichada River, Orinoco\] then squatted on the little benches, and
the women painted them from top to toe with a red paste; this, the women
said, would protect them from sicknesses (Cr, 548). On the branches of
the upper Rio Negro also red paint was considered a prophylactic against
disease (KG, <span class="small">I</span>, 158; <span
class="small">II</span>, 85, 150). The application of blood would almost
seem to have had an antecedent origin, from which that of the red paint
was but a development, and yet, strange to say, the positive evidence
now available points rather to the reputed curative than the protective
power of the vital fluid. Thus in some cases the father, when the child
is weakly, has his own flesh cut in close parallel lines: the blood
flowing from the wounds is mixed with water for washing and
strengthening the child (Da, 250). Among the Island Caribs, after the
couvade the child's face is smeared with the father's blood to impart
courage (RP, 550). On the Orinoco, when the Guama women recognize that
any of their children—nurslings or somewhat older ones—are sick, they
transfix their own tongues with finely-ground bone lancets; the blood
gushes forth in torrents and with it they bespatter their youngsters by
mouthfuls, while, with their hands, they smear it all over them from
head to foot (G, <span class="small">I</span>, 164). In the same area,
for older people it is one of the duties of the captains of the Guama
nation to slash his flesh daily and drain off his blood in order to
besmear the breasts of all those under his command who are sick (G,
<span class="small">I</span>, 164). Dance (250) speaks of an old man
being washed in turtle's blood.

   <span id="pp_241"></span>**241.**[\*](#pp_241.md) The widespread belief
in Spirits connected with mountains, rocks, stones, etc., will probably
help to explain the talismanic virtues ascribed to the green
Amazon-stones (*Lapis nephriticus*), the *piedra hijada* of the
Spaniards. Out on the islands "they also wear necklaces made out of
large crystals and green stones which come from the mainland toward the
Amazon River, and have a healing virtue; it is their precious ornament
and is only worn at feasts" (BBR, 248). Humboldt found them among the
Indians of the Rio Negro, where they are carried on the neck as amulets
for protection against fever, and the bites of poisonous snakes (AVH,
<span class="small">II</span>, 395, 462); Martius found them on the Rio
Negro among the inhabitants of Sylves, and Schomburgk in Demerara. The
last-named authority says:

>    Through the Caribs along the Guiana coast these stones were brought
> into Demerara where they are known as *Macuaba* or *Calicot* stones.
> On the Orinoco they are called <span id="page_291">p. 291</span>
> *Macagua*. They were formerly brought in considerable quantities by
> the Caribs to Demerara, but now very rarely . . . As I was told by
> people, these stones were also formerly brought to Demerara in the
> form of fishes and other animals, as well as with figures cut into the
> surfaces. . . . According to Barrere, they were treasured more than
> gold by the Caribs: such a stone was the price of a slave. Raleigh saw
> them on the Orinoko, and noticed that every Cacique had such a stone
> which was usually carried by his women: they treasured them more than
> gold. Lawrence Keymis says of the Carib and other tribes who dwell on
> the Arawari, below the Oyapoke: "Their money is white and green
> stones." He found the same thing on the Corentyn . . . According to
> Clavigero they are identical with the green stones of the Mexican
> Anahuacs: these people could cut all manners of figures out of this
> stone, and knew also how to cut diamonds. \[ScR, <span
> class="small">II</span>, 330-2.\]

   These Amazon stones, as just mentioned, were highly valued by the
Galibis of Cayenne, who called them *takourave*, about which Pierre
Barrere has left us this account:

>    This stone is of olive color, of a slightly paler green, and close
> to a pearl gray (*presque d'un gris de perles*). I have brought all
> colors from Guiana. The most common shape one gives to this stone is
> cylindrical, length of 2, 3, up to 4 inches, by six or seven lines in
> diameter, and drilled their whole length. I have seen some of them
> that were squared, oval, to which one had given the shape of a
> crescent and imprinted upon it the figure of a toad, or some other
> animals. This stone is known by lapidaries under the name of jade. It
> is highly polished, and so hard, that one can hardly work with it
> except with diamond powder. One has assured me that it is artificial:
> that a nation called Tapouye who live 150 leagues, or thereabout from
> Para, busy themselves in making them. \[PBa, 175.\]

   There is another interesting reference to these green and gray jade
stones in Surinam. They are stones harder than jasper, susceptible of a
fine polish and making fire with a steel, although oily to the sight and
touch; they are extremely hard to work. The Indians also set such great
store on them that they regard these stones as very precious jewels,
with which they decorate themselves when disposed to, show themselves
with an their fine attire (Fe, <span class="small">II</span>, 351). I
have come across a possible reference to them in a Warrau legend ([Sect.
*139*](aflg09.htm#pp_139).md). A comparison between these Amazon stones and
the drilled stones of quartz imperfectly crystalized, used as neck
ornaments and as symbols of authority by the chiefs among the Uaupes
River Indians (ARW, 191), is well worth consideration.
