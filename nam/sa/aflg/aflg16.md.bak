   <span id="pp_267"></span>**267.**[\*](#pp_267.md) In many of the tribes,
as the Warraus and the Caribs, the young people of both sexes can not
enter into permanent sexual partnership until they have successfully
undergone the puberty ordeals (Cr, 612); in others, the betrothal or
perhaps even the consummation of the marriage follows as a direct
consequence of such ordeals. The result has been that some authors have
referred certain marriage customs to puberty ceremonies, while
occasionally the reverse has happened. As a matter of fact they would
seem to be more or less identical. The puberty ordeals include (*a*)
more or less rigid fasting, combined with (*b*) exposure to the bites of
ants, etc., (*c*) severe scarification, or (*d*) sound flogging—all to
be borne without visible signs of suffering. A careful study of these
leads one to the conviction that with both sexes the effect is to ensure
the young people being healthy and strong, willing to work, skilful, and
industrious. In the case of the female, the general tenor of the facts
points to a belief in her being possessed by some Spirit prone to evil,
whose influence so far as practicable, has to be counteracted and
destroyed. Hence the piai blows on ([Sect. *85*](aflg05.htm#pp_85).md) and
mutters over the \[Makusi\] girl and her more valuable belongings so as
to disenchant her and everything she has come into contact with (ScR,
<span class="small">II</span>, 316) Some of the ordeals may be repeated,
though in a less degree, at the second, perhaps at the third menstrual
period.

   <span id="pp_268"></span>**268.**[\*](#pp_268.md) To account for this
enforced abstinence from sufficient food on the part of the women at
times of menstruation, a cacique on the Orinoco told Gumilla: "Our
ancestors observed that wherever the women, during their monthly
periods, happened to tread, there <span id="page_309">p. 309</span>
everything dried up, and that if any man trod where they had placed
their feet, his legs would swell: having studied the remedy, they
ordered us to starve them, so that their bodies should be free from the
poison" (G, <span class="small">I</span>, 159). So with the Pomeroon
Caribs, it was essential that when the girl was carried from her hammock
to the place where the scarification had been effected, and back again,
her feet must not touch the ground (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>,
431). Among the Pomeroon Arawaks, at the puberty ceremony of first
menstruation the girl is allowed no meat, but a little fish (and these
must be only of small size), together with small cassava cakes, of which
she must eat only the center, and a modicum of water in a very small
calabash. For the next six months or so, according to circumstances, the
young woman does not eat any meat of large animals, or fish which has
much blood in it, as flesh of the tapir, yarau, turtle, etc. With the
Warraus the girl must not speak or laugh or eat during the two or three
days of the period. Were she to do so, she would lose all her teeth when
she grew into a big woman. The first thing she is allowed to eat is a
little cassava flour wrapped in a leaf. The Pomeroon Carib girl who, for
the space of three days had to do without food or water, was not allowed
to utter a word. She was subsequently starved for a month on a diet of
roots, cassava bread, and water (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>,
431). Girls may die under this treatment.

   <span id="pp_269"></span>**269.**[\*](#pp_269.md) In order that the
Arawak girl, now become a woman, may henceforth have strength and
willingness to work, some old stranger whose character is known to be
strong and good, and a willing worker, is chosen to place an ant-frame
on the young woman's forehead, hands, and feet. The ants are attached at
their middles in the interstices of the plaited strands forrning the
framework, the frame itself being applied on the side from which all the
little heads are projecting. In Cayenne, Pitou (<span
class="small">II</span>, 267) describes the ant-frame as being applied
by the girl's mother. Among the Warraus, as with the Caribs, the young
people of both sexes cannot marry until they have gone through the
ordeal of the ants. Among the Warraus \[mouth of Orinoco\], the sufferer
is put in his hammock; they apply the tari-tari ants to him; if he cries
out he is condemned to celibacy (Cr, 612), My Warrau friends on the
Moruca recognize the above-mentioned insects as their natatari. They
tell me that long ago the same practices were carried on here. If the
girl cried it meant that she could not work, and was therefore not
deserving of a husband. The Roucouyenne (Cayenne Carib) would-be
bridegroom has to submit to a corresponding ordeal at the hands of the
piai: the latter applies ants to the chest and wasps on the forehead,
the whole of the body being subsequently stung with ants and wasps (Cr,
245-50). According to Coudreau, the Ojanas believe that the wasp ordeal
undergone by the men renders them <span id="page_310">p. 310</span>
skilful, clever, and industrious; and certainly the obligation of
publicly braving severe bodily suffering has an assured intrinsic value
(Go, 21). If the parents had not previously submitted themselves to
these ant and wasp tests and other ordeals the Cayenne Apaläis and
Roucouyennes believe that "only emaciated and sickly children would be
born to them" (Cr, 307). It is noteworthy that in both Surinam and
Cayenne the insects above referred to "are held in frames of bizarre
shapes fringed with feathers, representing quadrupeds and birds (Cr,
245-50). In such cases it certainly seems a very fair question to
inquire whether it is the properties and qualities of the particular
quadruped or bird represented in the shape of the frame, or those of the
old stranger, piai, or other individual applying it, that are supposed
to be impressed on the young person's character; unfortunately the
evidence thus far collected is insufficient to furnish a satisfactory
answer. But in the following example the object of applying the ants at
all would seem to be—though the suggestion after all may be wrong—to
obtain the personal characteristics and qualities of the European
traveler: "On entering the Apaläi village—a custom we did not find among
the Ouayanas—they brought me a framework of palm leaves to which were
attached at their centers, some big black ants. All the people of the
tribe, irrespective of age or sex, presented themselves for me to apply
it to their bodies, loins, thighs, etc." (Cr, 300).

   <span id="pp_270"></span>**270.**[\*](#pp_270.md) The Warrau boys had to
undergo at initiation greater ordeals than the girls, to demonstrate
their strength and manly prowess. These ordeals consisted principally in
the infliction of painful wounds upon the breast and arms with the tusk
of the wild boar or the beak of the toucan. If the boy endures all this
without showing signs of pain, he can rank thenceforth with the men; if
not, he has to submit to the ordeal on another occasion (ScR, <span
class="small">I</span>, 168). The Carib girl of the Pomeroon is operated
on by the piai, who with the incisors of the *Dasyprocta* \[acouri\]
makes deep incisions down her back, and from shoulder to shoulder; he
then rubs pepper into these wounds, without the poor tortured creature
daring to utter one cry of pain (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>,
431). So also in Cayenne, a number of bloody incisions are made in her
body, and it is only subsequent to this that she is allowed to wear the
apron-belt (*kewé-yo*): the young man is allowed to wear the lap-cloth
only after having passed the necessary ordeals (PBa, 225). In Cayenne
again, the girl is said to have her teeth filed down by the piai at her
puberty initiation (LAP, <span class="small">II</span>, 267).

   <span id="pp_271"></span>**271.**[\*](#pp_271.md) On returning from her
first bath \[after the first menstrul period\] the Makusi girl must
during the night sit upon a stool or stone, to be whipped by her mother
with thin rods without raising the slightest cry to wake the sleeping
occupants of the hut, an occurrence which would prove daugerous for her
future welfare. The <span id="page_311">p. 311</span> whipping takes
place also at the second menstrual period, but not subsequently (ScR,
<span class="small">II</span>, 316). Among the Puinavis Indians of the
Ynirida \[upper Orinoco\], the "Devil" who three days before has been
making terrible music in the forest at last enters the house of the poor
young girl, who tries to take to flight. A piai at this moment runs up
and, binding her eyes ([Sect. *255*](aflg15.htm#pp_255).md), leads her
through the village while the Devil all by himself is making a frightful
hubbub. Now is the time for the festival of the beating with the sticks,
when the men strike the unfortunate girl, who dares not complain. At
last a young man, admiring her courage, takes her place, and exposes
himself to the blows of the company; if he bears the pain without
murmuring she chooses him for her husband (Cr, 532). \[Compare [Sect.
*276*](aflg16.htm#pp_276.md).\] With the Uaupes River Indians, "all
relatives and friends of the parents are assembled, bringing, each of
them, pieces of sipó (an elastic climber); the girl is then brought out,
perfectly naked, into the midst of them, when each person present gives
her five or six severe blows with the sipó across the back and breast
till she falls senseless, and it sometimes happens, dead. If she
recovers it is repeated four times at intervals of six hours, and it is
considered an offence to the parents not to strike hard. During this
time numerous pots of all kinds of meat and fish have been prepared,
when the sipós are dipped in them and given to her to lick<span
id="page_311_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_311_note_1.md) and she is then
considered a woman and allowed to eat anything, and is marriageable. The
boys undergo a somewhat similar ordeal \[at puberty, as the girls\] but
not so severe, which initiates them into manhood, and allows them to see
the Jurupari music" (ARW, 345).

   <span id="pp_272"></span>**272.**[\*](#pp_272.md) What may be regarded
as remaining puberty ordeals to which the young girl has to submit at
her first menstruation, and to a minor degree at all her subsequent
ones, are certain procedures connected with her isolation, with water,
fire, cooking, and cooking apparatus, and with the hair. In the "old
days" of the Pomeroon Arawaks, the girl would remain with her mother in
a separate logie, or in a specially constructed compartment of the
house. The former would be distinguished by hanging from the posts waste
shreds of the ite (*Mauritia*) palm, that is, the leaves from which the
outer fibrous layer, for making twine, has already been removed. The
specially constructed room was called the *aibona-léhi*. The Warraus are
said to have used a separate closed house. With the Makusis, at the
first signs, the girl is separated from all intercourse with the
occupants of the hut; her hammock is taken from its usual place and
slung in the highest part of the hut, where the poor creature is exposed
to all the smoke which, if that be possible, is now increased. For the
first few days she must not leave her hammock at all during the daytime.
When the most active <span id="page_312">p. 312</span> and striking of
the symptoms have passed she can come down from her height, and occupy a
small place partitioned off in the darkest corner of the hut (ScR, <span
class="small">II</span>, 315). So also in Cayenne, the girl's hammock
was slung high up to the ridge of the *karbet* (PBa, 225). On the upper
Amazon, she is similarly banished to the *girao* \[an overhead staging
inside the oblong hut\] under the smoky and filthy roof (HWB, 383). She
must not go near water until when the period is past; her mother bathes
her in the closed room. If, during the day, the Arawak girl wishes to
micturate she must do so into a goblet, which she empties after dark in
the bush. When she thus similarly goes to ease herself, she must be
accompanied by her mother, and must take with her a lighted fire-stick,
which otherwise would not be used. The Makusi girl uses a fire which she
herself has to light, and alone gets the benefit of. For ten days she
cooks her cassava meal in her own pot at her own fire. Pots and drinking
vessels that she has used are broken, and the chips buried (ScR, <span
class="small">II</span>, 316). The Arawak girl must not comb her hair
but must let it hang loose until such time as her mother combs it after
bathing her when the event is over. The Warrau matron (or the father
sometimes) crops her (or his) daughter's hair; the Carib girl has hers
burned off (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 431). On the Aiary River
(Rio Negro), the hair cut from a girl at menstruation is used for head
and dance ornaments by the men (KG, <span class="small">I</span>, 181;
<span class="small">II</span>, 253).

   <span id="pp_273"></span>**273.**[\*](#pp_273.md) As a rule the puberty
ordeal is brought to a conclusion with drink-and-dance party, in which
the girl herself neither drinks nor dances, though she constitutes of
course the central object of attraction. If an Arawak, she is brought
out of the closed room by a middle-aged man, and shown in her
decorations to the assembled guests; she then takes her seat on a stool
especially made for her, shaped like a crocodile or a "tiger." Previous
to these festivities her brother or father has killed a hummingbird,
dried it, and cut it up into very small pieces. Every visitor, male or
female, now gets a bit of this on a small piece of cassava, the idea
being that when the girl grows older she will obtain her share of any of
the good things that the other people may possess. The Warrau young
woman is decked with beads and the white feather-down of various birds,
as *Crax* and *Ardea*, apparently stuck with some gummy substance to the
smooth head \[the hair having been cut\], and the arms and legs (ScR,
<span class="small">I</span>, 168). The Caribs paint her red all over.
In place of the stool they would seem to have employed a stone or (?)
plate (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 431).

   <span id="pp_274"></span>**274.**[\*](#pp_274.md) The following are the
ordeals regularly undergone by Arawak women at subsequent menstruations,
and which I understand are undergone, to a greater or less extent, by
women of other tribes also, for example, the Warraus. The girl takes up
her quarters in a separate logie or banab, distinguishable from all
other structures by the suspended bunches of waste ite shreds. She lies
in a smaller hammock <span id="page_313">p. 313</span> than usual. She
must not eat meat from any big animal (as tapir and turtle), or fish
which contains much blood. The flesh of any game hunted by dogs is
strictly forbidden her; otherwise the dogs would be permanently spoiled
for hunting. On no account may she cook, bake, or prepare drink, for
other men or women. She must not cross water, travel in a corial, or
bathe in a river or a pond; if she wishes to wash she may pour water out
of a calabash over herself. Using a separate fire for herself, it is
imperative that she never blows one out. She has to cook in a smaller
pot, and employ a smaller fan, goblet, etc., all especially made for the
purpose. In this connection I would suggest that many of the "toy
vessels," described by im Thurn as being "seen in and about almost every
Indian house" (IT, 278), are in reality the pottery-ware used specially
during the periods of menstruation. Finally, the girl must not comb her
hair but must let it hang loose.

   In addition to the bathing prohibition, the Makusi women during these
times must not go into the forest, where they would be exposed to the
embraces of snakes (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 316). On the
lower Guaviar the Piapoco husband is said to bring the wife her food
during the few days that she remains isolated in the special hut (Cr,
526).

   <span id="pp_275"></span>**275.**[\*](#pp_275.md) In matters of
courtship the would-be benedict knows that the acceptance of an offering
of food or of other objects is the token of a favorable, the rejection,
that of an unfavorable issue. The Arawak lover, after making sure
beforehand through the girl's relatives that he will not meet with a
refusal, pays a visit to her parents, tells them how poor he is, that he
has no wife, etc. At the conclusion of these preliminaries the young
woman puts before him something to eat (SR, <span
class="small">II</span>, 459). He knows that the path of true love is
going to run smooth. So again in the same tribe if a father wants some
well-known person for son-in-law, he lets his daughter place food before
the latter during the course of a visit; if he partakes of it, the union
is assured; if not, the old man knows that their wishes do not agree
(ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 459). At the present day, on the
Pomeroon, when the Arawak young man returns on the appointed day to
receive an answer from the father, he takes care to leave his hammock at
the waterside, or on the pathway. If the girl brings this in, he knows
that his prospects are favorable, any doubt being clinched by the father
telling his daughter to give the young man cassava, pepper-pot, beltiri,
or anything else that may be on hand. In Surinam, it is sufficient for
the man anxious to marry, to take to the girl all the game and fish that
he has caught during the day; if she accepts this present it is a sign
that she is willing to have him (Fe, 38). In Cayenne, with the Galibis,
as soon as a girl has taken a fancy to an Indian she will offer him
drink, together with firewood to light near <span id="page_314">p.
314</span> his hammock; if he refuses the offer it means that he does
not want her (PBa, 220).

   <span id="pp_276"></span>**276.**[\*](#pp_276.md) In none of the tribes
is any sexual union publicly recognized as permanent—the closest
correspondence I can find to our idea of marriage—prior to the advent of
womanhood. Certain of the ordeals of puberty are closely paralleled:
indeed, as at puberty, the candidates for matrimony have to submit to a
rigid fast with or without exposure to ants, wasps, etc., a sound
flogging (KG, <span class="small">II</span>, 144), or a severe
scarification. It is only the males on whom something additional is
imposed in the way of trials of skill and the like. Among the Makusis
the man, for some time before marriage, abstains from meat (IT, 221-3),
which was apparently the case with the Guiyquirie and Mapoye females of
the Orinoco. Concerning the latter tribes Gumilla says: For forty days
before marrying, their girls are locked up to a continuous and rigid
fast: three seeds of the *Murichi*, three ounces of cassava with a
pitcher of water is their daily ration; and so, on the day of the
nuptials, they are more like corpses than brides (G, <span
class="small">I</span>, 159). No reasons for this abstention are given,
though it was asserted for the Carib girls on the Islands, who were
treated similarly, that the idea of the fasting was to prevent them
becoming sluggards, not likely to work when married (BBR, 250). The
young Apaläi males on the Parou River, Cayenne, have to undergo the
*maraké* (the ant and wasp ordeal) prior to attempting the trials of
skill. Among the Guahibos of the Vichada River (Orinoco) on the occasion
of the marriage of a widow, after having covered her husband's remains
with earth, they put her on the grave, and remove the rag which, for the
time being covers her chest: she then holds her hands above her head: a
man comes forward and strikes her breasts with a switch—this is her
future husband: the other men hit her on the shoulders, and she receives
the flagellation without a groan: her fiancé in his turn is struck with
the switch, his hands joined above his head and without a murmur (Cr,
548). \[Compare [Sect. *271*](aflg16.htm#pp_271.md).\] After the above
ceremony, they place another woman on the grave and pierce the extremity
of her tongue with a bone: the blood runs down her chest, and a sorcerer
besmears her breasts with it (Cr, 548).

   <span id="pp_277"></span>**277.**[\*](#pp_277.md) In most of the tribes
there were certain trials of skill ([Sect. *30*](aflg02.htm#pp_30).md),
certain marriage ordeals, which the would-be suitor had successfully to
surmount before gaining permanent possession of his wife, in addition to
the puberty ordeals that had previously to be passed. These marriage
ordeals at the same time may be admittedly regarded as omens or tokens
of what the father-in-law or his daughter might reasonably expect from
the husband in the future. The Uacarras Indians, a tribe on the River
Apaporis, a branch of the Uaupes, of the Rio Negro, have a trial of
skill at shooting with the bow and arrow, and if the young man does not
show himself a <span id="page_315">p. 315</span> good marksman, the girl
refuses him on the ground that he will not be able to shoot fish and
game enough for the family (ARW, 346). On the Orinoco, he had to kill a
bush-hog all by himself and bring it to his future father-in-law's house
to show that he was indeed a man (G, <span class="small">II</span>,
285). The young Apaläi Indians on the Parou River, Cayenne, after
submitting to the *maraké* (ant and wasp ordeal) must now "go through
the target test: with their backs turned, they have to throw cassava
pellets (*boulettes*) at a piece of wood upon which a circle has been
traced, and must hit it three times running, etc." (Cr, 307). In its
most complete form, however, the shooting ordeal seems to have been
carried out by the Arawaks, and it is from the very old people of this
people that I have been able to gather the following facts concerning
what used to take place in bygone days. When the youth went to his
future father-in-law and asked for the girl, the old man would consult
his wife and daughter, as a rule, and if everything were satisfactory
would say "yes," but would not give him actual possession of her until
he had performed certain deeds, the first and foremost of which was to
shoot into a certain woodpecker's nest. He would accordingly ask the
suitor whether he were ready or whether he wished to wait a few days.
The latter would of course say he was quite ready, so impetuous is
youth, and would give a minute description of the situation of the
particular tree, usually one close to the water-side, into which he
proposed shooting the arrow. The girl's father, however, would
invariably plead some excuse to put him off, say to the next day, and in
the meantime would get ready a big corial—big enough to carry 10 or 12
men—and engage his crew. When next morning the young man turned up
again, the old man had everything ready and would get them all into the
boat, he himself steering. The girl herself had to sit on the left of
her would-be husband in the bows. When within a comparatively short
distance from the tree wherein the woodpecker's nest lay concealed, the
old man would call upon the crew to pull with all their strength—and the
young man to draw his bow. Before, however, the arrow had sped, and
while yet the bow was fully stretched, the woman had to touch his left
side with her hand signifying that if his arrow reached its mark she
agreed to be his. If he missed, the performance had to be postponed to
another occasion, he having the right to try as many times as he liked
until he succeeded and in the meantime he might continue practising on
his own account. Luck might assist him on the first occasion, sometimes
on the second, third, or fourth, or he might have to make the trial so
many times that he would give up the attempt as well as all thoughts for
the girl, and proceed to some other settlement where the woodpecker's
nests were situated to better advantage. Without shooting his arrow into
the nest the wooer would certainly never get possession of the
girl—neither father nor mother <span id="page_316">p. 316</span> would
give way on that particular point. On the other hand, supposing his aim
to have been finally suceessful, the girl would be as wife to him, and
he would take up residence in his father-in-law's house. The next thing
was for the old Arawak paterfamilias to mark out a piece of ground,
which within so many days the young man to whom he presented an ax for
the purpose, had to cut and clear for a provision field. The time
specified was usually short, the young man having to work with might and
main, starting early and returning late, but finally completing the
task. A similar ordeal was exacted among the Makusis and other tribes
(ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 316). But there was still something
else for the Arawak would-be bridegroom to do. For during the time
occupied in cutting the field, the old man had busied himself in
collecting a large number of crab quakes (baskets), and subsequently he
would accompany the lad out to sea, and would himself watch to see that
within the one day the youngster really filled all the baskets through
his own exertions, and did not obtain the assistance of friends. This
completed, the youth became henceforth one of the legal heirs of the
house. Should, however, the lad not have cut the field nor filled the
requisite number of quakes within the allotted period he would have been
laughed and jeered at when attending subsequent paiwarris. The two
ordeals, just described, however, were never so essential as that of the
shooting of the arrow into the woodpecker's nest.

   <span id="pp_278A"></span>**278A.**[\*](#pp_278A.md) I have been un able
to confirm Brett's statement as to the members of the Demarena, a
particular family group, being restricted to connubium only with those
of the Korobohana family group ([BrB,
179](../lmbg/lmbg5b.htm#page_179).md); otherwise, all the Guiana Indian
tribes are exogamous <span id="page_319">p. 319</span> and trace descent
exclusively through the mother. Certainly among the Arawaks and Warraus,
sexual union between persons of certain degrees of cousinship is
regarded in the same light as is incest by Europeans. (See [Sect.
*131*](aflg09.htm#pp_131)..md)

   <span id="pp_279"></span>**279.**[\*](#pp_279.md) An analysis of the
pre-natal and post-natal ordeals undergone by father and mother bring
into prominence the fact that they bear remarkably strong resemblance to
those submitted to at puberty (by both sexes) and at menstruation
([Sect. *267*](aflg16.htm#pp_267) et seq..md). In the main, these ordeals
consist of food restrictions; the tolerance of severe physical pain
without visible signs of suffering; and procedures connected with
isolation, with water, fire, and cooking. The proper performance of the
childbirth ordeals insures that nothing will go amiss with the baby.
With regard to the food restrictions, before the child's birth, these
may be imposed on both parents.

   Among the Pomeroon Arawaks, though the killing and eating of a snake
during the woman's pregnancy is forbidden to both father and mother the
husband is allowed to kill and eat any other animal. The cause assigned
for the taboo of the snake is that the little infant might be similar,
that is, able neither to talk nor to walk. Neither parent, however, when
carrying a piece of cassava cake, may either turn it over in the hand,
or curl it up at the sides; otherwise, the ears of the child, when born,
will be found curled over. Any game hunted by dogs is strictly forbidden
the pregnant woman of this tribe, just as it is at her menstruation;
otherwise the dog would be spoiled for hunting purposes, permanently in
the latter circumstances, temporarily in the former, the dog recovering
its powers only when the baby was born. Hence, when a man brings home
any animal that has been hunted by a dog, it is his wife's business to
see that it is not partaken of by any woman in either of the states
named. An interesting reference to this belief will be found in
*Timehri* (vol. <span class="small">II</span>, 1883, p. 355), in which
report is made of a woman's wages being stopped because, while weeding,
she partook of the game caught by a hunting dog and so rendered the dog
useless. She is forbidden to eat when pregnant any "big meat," as turtle
or tapir, or fish that has much blood in it, as at menstruation; she can
now eat only the tail portion of a fish. Infringement of any of these
rules will result <span id="page_320">p. 320</span> in something being
amiss with the child when born. The Indians of the Uaupes River, Rio
Negro, "believe that if a woman, during her pregnancy, eats of any meat,
any other animal partaking of it will suffer; if a domestic animal or
tame bird, it will die; if a dog, it will be for the future incapable of
hunting; and even a man will ever after be unable to shoot that
particular kind of game" (ARW, 349); hence, meat has to be avoided by
her. A Pomeroon Arawak female will beget twins through eating any double
fruit during the period of her pregnancy. The Saliva husband, however
(G, <span class="small">I</span>, 189), regarding such a result as a
sure sign of his wife's disloyalty, believing that only one of the twins
could possibly be his. Another pregnancy restriction on the Pomeroon is
that the Arawak woman must not laugh, and must not grieve; neither may
she look at the face of a dead person though it is permissible for her
to gaze on the body.

   <span id="pp_280"></span>**280.**[\*](#pp_280.md) And even when the baby
does put in an appearance, the mother's troubles, like the father's, are
far from over; for until her youngster is able to walk well, the Arawak
mother on the Pomeroon must eat neither deer, turtle, nor iguana,
animals which, for some days after birth, creep or crawl very slowly, in
contradistinction, for instance, from the bush-hog, that will start to
run directly it has littered. The idea is that by eating such flesh the
mother will cause her infant to walk too slowly. On the islands, the
Carib mother abstained from female crabs, which would give the child
stomachache, while the father had to avoid certain animals for fear of
the youngster participating in their natural faults. If a father ate
turtle, the child would be heavy, and have no brains; if he ate a
parrot, the child would have a parrot nose; if a crab, the consequence
would be long legs (BBR, 248-9). The mainland Caribs of Cayenne
(Galibis) avoided deer, hog, and other large game (PBa, 223-4). Brett,
in a quotation apparently from McClintock, says that the Akawai, Carib,
and Warrau husband abstains from venison after his wife's delivery for
the same reason that the Arawak mother shuns it (Br, 356). The
Roucouyenne father must eat no fish or game that has been caught with an
arrow, but must content himself with cassava and with small fish that
have been poisoned with the "nicou" plant; should he disregard this
taboo the child will either soon die or develop vicious propensities.
For the Carib Islander, paternity must undoubtedly have proved somewhat
trying; for ten or twelve days he had "to take to his bed," and subsist
on a little cassava and water; he ate only of the insides of the cassava
cakes, leaving the outsides for the subsequent feasting; for from 6 to
10 or 12 months later he had to abstain from several meats, as manati,
turtle, hog, fowl, and fish, for fear of hurting his infant, but such
extreme fasting was carried out only at the birth of the first male
child. <span id="page_321">p. 321</span> When the fasting period was
approaching its conclusion, he had to submit to a scarification, by
means of agouti teeth, upon his shoulders without a murmur, and the
better he bore this infliction the more valiant would his son prove; the
blood thus made to flow was not allowed to fall onto the ground, but was
smeared on the child's face to make it courageous (*généreux*) (RoP,
550). The actual termination of the fast must here have been celebrated
more or less ceremoniously: "Placed on a red-painted seat, the women
bring him food, which the old men put in his mouth, as they would do to
a child, the cassava and the fish being in small pieces; he eats the
cassava, but ejects the fish after chewing it. He would become sick if
he began to eat too well at once; he is made to drink by being held by
the neck" (BBR, 249). The scarification and flogging ordeals of puberty
are repeated on the Carib father, both island and mainland, after his
wife's delivery of either boy or girl: the reputed idea is "to transfer
his courage (*muth*) to the children" (ScR, <span
class="small">II</span>, 431). In the former case, after a course of
very limited diet he is "brought to a public place, looking like a
skeleton, and standing upright on two large flat cakes of cassavas. The
sponsors then begin to scratch and cut his skin with very sharp agouti
teeth. They first begin on the sides, then the shoulders, from the arm
to the elbow, from elbow to wrist, and from the thighs to the ankles. .
. . He is then painted and rubbed with *roucou* leaves, pepper seeds and
tobacco juice, and placed on a red-painted seat" (BBR, 248-9), and fed,
as already mentioned. The Mainland Carib, the Galibi of Cayenne, after
some weeks' subsistence on a stinted diet, is "scarified on various
parts of the body with fish-bones or agouti teeth: very often even he is
given several lashes with a whip" (PBa, 223-4).

   <span id="pp_281"></span>**281.**[\*](#pp_281.md) After the birth of the
baby come the various procedures connected with the isolation of one or
both parents; in the case of the father, his so-called "lying-in" is
spoken of as the *couvade*, and is met with in many tribes, for example,
Arawaks, Warraus, Caribs (who call the practice *kenonimáno*), Makusis,
and Wapisianas. In the case of the mainland Caribs (Cayenne) "when their
wives are confined for the first time, the newly married husband has to
sling his hammock high up to the ridge of the house" (PBa, 223-4). With
the Island Caribs, if the child is a firstborn male, the husband, as
soon as the woman is delivered, goes to bed, complains and acts as
though he had been delivered (BBR, 248), and submits to a restricted
diet, etc. As with the Caribs, so with the Arawaks and Warraus, it is
practically the husband who is isolated, and does the "lying-in."
Indeed, in these three tribes, the woman is isolated only during actual
delivery, which takes place either out in the bush, in a separate
shelter, or in a compartment specially partitioned off from <span
id="page_322">p. 322</span> the rest of the house. With the bath that
she takes within a comparatively few hours after the interesting event
has occurred, her isolation, and with it any dangerous influence of her
recent condition ceases. The woman is her own accoucheuse; even during
the night and in wet season she will leave the house and retire to a
secluded spot near by. She occupies herself with her daily affairs until
the last moment: she may come home with a quake containing the baby
instead of the usual cassava; and "on the morrow she is prepared to
undertake all the indoor work of the household" (Da, 248). Confinement
takes place either in the forest or in some little hut; she is always
alone unless some difficulty presents itself, when an old woman will
attend (PBa, 226). With the Makusis and Wapisianas, both parents engage
in a "lying-in" for a shorter or longer period after the appearance of
baby. The Makusi father takes to his hammock placed near that of his
wife, until the navel-string falls off; but before doing this, if he has
no separate building, he will prepare a palm-leaf partition in the hut
(ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 314). When the partition was
finished the \[Wapisiana\] husband hung up in it both his own and his
wife's hammock, and therein they lay to "take to bed" (*die Wochen zu
halten*) like the Makusis (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 389).
During the lying-in of the mother, or couvade of the father, they are
considered equally unclean, such uncleanness being occasionally regarded
as persisting for long afterward. Thus, the Mainland Carib (in Cayenne)
is obliged to devote himself to the service of an old Indian and to
leave his wife for some months; during this period he has to be
submissive and regard himself as a real slave (PBa, 223-4). When in
couvade a visitor enters his house, that visitor's dogs will soon die
(Cr, 241). The Arawaks and Warraus say that if a man during the period
he ought to remain in couvade indulges in sexual relations with any
woman other than his wife, the infant will die through inability to
exert its emunctory powers. After lighting her fire and supplying her
with drinking cups it is the duty of the female Wapisiana population to
keep as far away from the lying-in woman as possible for the few days
that she is deemed unclean (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 389).
With the completion of the couvade, on the upper Tiquie River, among the
Tuyuka and other Indians, the grandmother "smokes" the pathway leading
from the *maloka* to the water as well as the water itself, before the
parents have their first bath (KG, <span class="small">I</span>, 312).
With the Uaupes River (Rio Negro) Indians, when a birth takes place in
the house, everything is taken out of it, even the pans and pots, and
bows and arrows, till the next day (ARW, 345).

   <span id="pp_281A"></span>**281A.**[\*](#pp_281A.md) In connection with
this question of couvade, it is of interest to note that from among the
Caribs I obtained a trace of an idea of the male acting as the
parturient parent.

   <span id="pp_282"></span>**282.**[\*](#pp_282.md) There seem to be some
curious restrictions concerning water, so far as the father is
concerned, both previous and subsequent to birth. R. L. Kingston gives
the following interesting pre-natal example: "While some (True) Caribs
were poisoning the upper Pomeroon with haiari for fish, I saw one of
them rub his shins with the beaten and washed-out haiari. Asking why he
did this, he told me his wife was with child, and that he could not
therefore go into the water without first rubbing his legs with haiari,
lest all the fish should sink to the bottom" \[instead of floating
narcotized on the surface\] (Ti, <span class="small">II</span>, 1883, p.
355). It was said to be a custom of the Island Caribs that "they often
deliver near the fire, and the child is bathed at once; but a funny
precaution is, that if it is born at night, the men who are sleeping in
the house go and bathe so that the child may not catch cold" (BBR,
248-9). It is curious that the Pomeroon Arawak women will not bathe
their infants until such time as the navel-string heals, for fear of the
same contingency happening. On the other hand, his usual bath is
forbidden the Makusi father (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 314)
during his time of couvade. Strange to say, it is the bath which in most
tribes constitutes the final purification of the mother, at the end of
her lying-in period, whether such period be of a few hours' or several
days' duration. Beyond what has already been mentioned concerning
fire—how some women (Island Caribs) will often deliver near a fire and
how others will apparently have one lighted for them—I have found no
further references to childbirth in connection with fire, except one in
connection with the navel-string. Bancroft is the only author who speaks
of the division of "the umbilic vessels, which they do with a brand of
fire, which cauterizes their orifices, and renders a ligature
unnecessary" (Ba, 330). Two old Arawak women are my authority for saying
that in the old days the cord was burned off with a heated nail. Cooking
for a man is strictly prohibited to a pregnant woman: she may however
"clean" the meat, but in cleaning any animal or fish she must not cut
off the ears, nails, or fins. In this latter connection there is a
curious prohibition concerning fingernails in force among the Makusis:
neither men nor women at times of couvade or lying-in must scratch their
bodies or heads <span id="page_324">p. 324</span> with their nails. A
piece of the midrib of the kokerite palm is specially employed for the
purpose (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 314).

   <span id="pp_283"></span>**283.**[\*](#pp_283.md) In many of the tribes
during the couvade, and often for long afterward, the husband is
prohibited from engaging in certain of his ordinary occupations. The
Pomeroon Arawak must neither smoke, lift any heavy weight, use a
fish-hook, nor have intimate relations with any woman. The Mainland
Carib of Cayenne was not allowed to cut any big timber with an ax (PBa,
223-4). The Makusi must not touch his weapons (ScR, <span
class="small">II</span>, 313). Should these and similar prohibitions be
not observed, some evil would be sure to befall the child. There is
another interesting example recorded of a man (? Arawak) during couvade
lying in his hammock and twisting a new bowstring; baby began to scream,
with the result that the father had to undo the whole line (Ti, <span
class="small">II</span>, 1883, p. 355).

   When one realizes what the Indian conception of child-life is, the
explanation of the above otherwise extraordinary customs becomes
comparatively simple. In its material as well as in its spirit nature
the baby is believed to be part and parcel of both parents, and even at
birth is not considered to have an independent existence. Its material
dependence on the father ceases only when the navel-string is finally
detached, the signal for the male parent to conclude his "hatching" or
couvade. The baby's spirit nature does not, however, usually free itself
from the mother until the lapse of many months, when it begins to crawl
or walk (an occasion which in some tribes seems to have been celebrated
by a festival, with hair cutting and other features); hence, all this
time, whatever can affect the mother in the way of food, or otherwise,
exerts a corresponding influence on the child. On the other hand, its
spirit nature may occasionally tend to wander all on its own account.
Thus, when a Moruca River woman is carrying her very young infant along
a pathway and happens to meet a cross path, she will break off a leaf or
two from an adjoining bush, and throw it on the latter; baby's Spirit
must follow her and not go off in another direction. On the conclusion
of the couvade the baby's spirit nature, though physically freed from
the Spirit of the father, and in that sense independent of it,
nevertheless accompanies the father for a similar period, that is, until
it can crawl, and can be influenced by it so long as the companionship,
so to speak, is retained. When the infant begins to crawl, its hair is
cut for the first time. Rev. Mr. Dance was, I believe, among the first
to appreciate fully the true signification of these facts in connection
with, presumably, the Arawaks. I myself have had opportunities for
studying them among Arawaks as well as Warraus.

   For my own part, I am very much inclined to believe that this little
Baby Spirit is identical with the Familiar Spirit ([Sect.

   <span id="pp_284"></span>**284.**[\*](#pp_284.md) In view of the facts
mentioned throughout this chapter it is as well to note that, on the
Orinoco, when an infant (male or female) was born with any defect or
monstrosity it was put to death (G, <span class="small">II</span>, 60).
Similar procedure was in vogue in Cayenne (PBa, 227), while Schomburgk
states that "the shocking practice of destroying deformed children is
not so general among the savages of Guayana as has been supposed" (ScF,
219). On the Amazon there was the curious custom of killing all the
first-born children among the Ximánas and Cauxanas, tribes met with
between the Iça and Japura Rivers (ARW, 355). Among the Zaparos of the
Napo River (upper Amazon), when a mother having a very young child dies,
the child is sometimes buried alive ([Sect. *76*](aflg05.htm#pp_76).md)
with her (AS, 175). On the Orinoco, among the Salivas, twins were
considered a sign of dishonor.

   The same thing takes place on the River Cuduiary, among the Kobéwas,
at the present day, the second-born of the twins being killed, but if of
different sexes, the girl is sacrificed (KG, <span
class="small">II</span>, 146).

   <span id="pp_284A"></span>**284A.**[\*](#pp_284A.md) There are certainly
traces of a belief in sexual relationships having no necessary
connection with the production of children. Even at the present day
women can cohabit with Water Spirits without disastrous consequences
resulting ([Sect. *186*](aflg12.htm#pp_186).md). On the other hand women
can get babies if they want them, by eating certain binas, plant or
animal ([Sects. *237*](aflg14.htm#pp_237), [*238*](aflg14.htm#pp_238).md);
in a case of this kind the <span id="page_326">p. 326</span> child is
already in existence, its body being attached to, and by some mysterious
means passing into, the body of the mother. As to the origin of such
babies, all I can gather is that they arrive in the water of in the
bush, and hence may make their appearance in our mundane world either as
a gift from the Water Spirits ([Sect. *186*](aflg12.htm#pp_186).md), or at
the instigation of the Spirits of the Forest ([Sects.
*117*](aflg08.htm#pp_117), [*302*](aflg17.htm#pp_302).md), with or without
the agency of the piai. The following is a Warrau story bearing on this
subject:

   <span id="pp_284B"></span>**284B.**[\*](#pp_284B.md) Arawaks believe
that birth-marks and moles (*namarakan*) are due to the failure of the
mother, during pregnancy, to get what she wanted. She may have said,
"Oh! how I should like to have just a bit of marudi!" thoughtlessly
placing her hand on her face, breast, body, or thigh; her baby, will be
born with a corresponding mark on the particular part touched. The
"Mongolian spot" is regarded by the women as due to the position of the
afterbirth being near the surface in the corresponding part of the
mother's body. The Moruca River Arawaks call this spot *tu-tebe*, but as
it begins to fade it is known as *anakwarro*.

weft of these crab-quakes is known to the Arawaks as the kassaroa, or
"four-eye fish," from the manner in which the starting strads are
arranged, like so many "eyes." The idea intended to be conveyed here is
that as the man in question did not really know how to make these
baskets, he was anxious to get a full view of the fish, so as to serve
him for a model which he could copy.
