## C<span class="small">HAPTER</span> VIII THE SPIRITS OF THE BUSH <span class="small">NATURAL HISTORY</span>

   <span class="small">Various names applied (*[94](#pp_94)*.md); the
Yàwahu—Tukuyuha, Dai-dai, etc., general appearance (*[95](#pp_95)*.md), and
special association with the silk-cotton tree (*[96](#pp_96)*.md); Ekkekuli
and Mansinskiri (*[97](#pp_97)*.md); an unusual form of Bush Spirit
(*[98](#pp_98)*); the Hebu (*[99](#pp_99)*.md); the Immawari
(*[100](#pp_100)*); the Yurokon, etc. (*[101](#pp_101)*.md). But Bush
Spirits may be zoomorphic—able to change into animals, as Tigers,
Goat-suckers (*[102](#pp_102), [103](#pp_103)*.md). They can be recognized
by Sound (*[104](#pp_104)*) or by Smell (*[105](#pp_105)*.md).  
   They are very shrewd; can bring the dead to life, and render
themselves invisible (*[106](#pp_106)*.md); may occasionally do kindnesses
to people (*[107](#pp_107)*.md), but generally prefer mischief, though this
may be due to the Indians' own fault (*[108](#pp_108)*.md); they cause all
the mishaps and accidents of daily life (*[109](#pp_109)*.md)—damage crops,
raise disputes, bring death and sickness, produce transformations
(*[110](#pp_110)-115*); they are excellent hunters (*[116](#pp_116)*.md).  
   They are fond of women, human flesh, and children at the breast
(*[117](#pp_117)-120*), and of tobacco (*[121](#pp_121)-122*.md); are
usually of abnormally large size (*[123](#pp_123)*.md); shrink from
exposure of all descriptions; as to daylight, or in connection with name
or origin (*[124](#pp_124)*.md); can not endure being mimicked or chaffed
(*[125](#pp_125)*.md).  
   It is best to leave these Bush Spirits strictly to themselves, as
they bring only harm in the long run (*[126](#pp_126)-128*.md); if
circumstances force one into their company, measures can be taken to rid
the house and neighborhood of them (*[129](#pp_129)*.md); also the road
when one is traveling (*[130](#pp_130)*.md).</span>

   <span id="pp_94"></span>**94.**[\*](#pp_94.md) Those Spirits which,
emanating from the human corpse, ultimately find a resting place in the
tree, field, forest, or bush, are known collectively as Forest Spirits
or Bush Spirits. But let us not forget that certain of the Bush Spirits
may arise from the dead bodies of animals and birds, and may even
develop spontaneously. The generic term applied to them varies with the
tribes: thus, in Cayenne there is Hyorokon (Galibi) or Hyrouca (LAP,
<span class="small">II</span>, 223), Amignao and Anaanh (Arroua), Maboya
(Carib) (PBa, 206) and Yolok (Carib); in British Guiana, Yawahu
(Arawak), Hebo or Hebu (Warrau), Yurokon (Carib), and Immawari (Akawai);
on the upper Orinoco, the Atabapo, Inirida, and Guainia (*i. e.*, upper
Rio Negro), it is Iolok-iamo (AVH, <span class="small">II</span>, 362,
385); on the Aiary River, Iya-imi (Siusi) (KG, <span
class="small">I</span>, 113); on the Orinoco, Tanasimi (Achagua), Memelü
(Betoyes, Jiraras), and Duati (Guajivas) (G, <span
class="small">II</span>, 24); on the Amazons, Caypor (HwB, 279),
Curupari (ibid., 36), and Jurupari (ibid., 381), but this word is said
to be Lingoa Geral (KG, <span class="small">I</span>, 113). It will be
noticed how the term Yurokon, in the form of Hyorokon, Hyrouca, Yolok,
Iolok-iamo, Iya-imi, is spread throughout the extent of the Guianas,
while in the form of Juluca ([Sect. *216*](aflg13.htm#pp_216).md) it is met
with on the islands, as the personification of the Rainbow. I have also
<span id="page_171">p. 171</span> shown the probability of its identity
with the Shadow Spirit ([Sect. *68*](aflg05.htm#pp_68).md). Equally
striking is its resemblance to the word Huracan, the name given by the
Aztecs to the autumnal equinox. (Cordonazo de San Francisco). Huracan
means the Spirit (*corazon*) of the Sea, the Spirit of Heaven and Earth:
the Nahuas were unable to conceive of the author of the universe except
in a cataclysm. Cyclone, Hurricane, or Cordonazo de San Francisco are
names of the same phenomenon. Hurakan of the Quiche myths is the
Kukulcan of the Maya, the Quetzalcouatl (morning-star) of Mexican
mythology. Yawahu, the Arawak generic term, includes the Tu-kuyuha, the
Ekkekuli or Manahau, and the Mansinskiri Spirits, the Tu-kuyuha being
subdivided into Konoko-(Tu)kuyuha and Adda-(Tu)kuyuha, according as they
are more specially associated with the bush and forest, or trees,
respectively.

   <span id="pp_95"></span>**95.**[\*](#pp_95.md) Each tribe seems to
exhibit variations in the ideas held as to the form, shape, and
peculiarities assumed by its respective Bush Spirits. Of some of these I
am able to furnish the following particulars: Starting with the Arawak
Yawahus, there are the Tukuyuhas, the Konoko variety of which are spoken
of by the Akawai as Arai-dai or Dai-Dai, and by the creoles of the
Colony as "Bush devils." An Arawak woman told me that such Spirits are
hairy people having so much hair that one can not see their faces. They
live underground in the forest; they may be men or women; they are met
with suddenly, but may often give a premonitory sign or token of their
coming. The token varies greatly, and even when taken note of is usually
recognized only after the event of which it has given warning has taken
place ([Sect. *220*](aflg14.htm#pp_220) et seq..md). Having no bows and
arrows, these Spirits are accustomed to fight only with their limbs, so
that when an Indian has been attacked and returns home, where he is sure
to die shortly after, no marks will be found on his body. Sometimes the
Konoko-(Tu)kuyuha will not even allow the victim to return alive, but
will eat him, causing him to disappear totally; the friends and
relatives never see any further signs of him. The attack may be made at
any time, day or night. Now, because these beings ([Sect.
*331*](aflg18.htm#pp_331).md) have no bows, or rather what bows they have
are broken, the old-time Arawak people used to call them
Shimarabu-akaradáni (*lit*., bows-broken), and when returning home from
some hunting or trading expedition, would sing out that name before
reaching their houses, with the view of preventing these undesirable
Spirits making an entry ([Sect. *129*](aflg08.htm#pp_129).md).

   <span id="pp_96"></span>**96.**[\*](#pp_96.md) The Adda variety of
Tukuyuha Spirits, particularly associated with trees, are sometimes in
the shape of birds: among such notable trees are the silk-cotton
(*Bombax* sp.) and the kofa (*Clusia grandiflora*). In Cayenne it would
seem that the Hyrouca \[Yurokon\] was specially attached to a tree known
as *panacoco* (LAP, <span class="small">II</span>, 223), <span
id="page_172">p. 172</span> which thus far I have not been able to
identify. The Indian guide breaks his arrow and asks pardon from the
Spirit for his European visitor having touched the timber with unclean
victims—a fish and an agouti.<span
id="page_172_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_172_note_1.md)

   <span id="pp_97"></span>**97.**[\*](#pp_97.md) When perceptible to human
eyes, the Ekkekuli or Manahau have the appearance of black people
(negroes): they are of a savage nature, killing Indians, and abducting
children. If anywhere in the neighboring caves and gullies and their
names be loudly called in the forest, they will materialize. The
Mansinskiri (Arawak), or Maihisikiri (Warrau) is a particular Yawahu
wandering about the bush, and in and among the trees, of which the
native women, subsequent to certain regular occasions, have to be
especially careful. Such Spirits can assume the identical material
appearance of their real husbands or lovers, but woe betide those poor
women who yield to their solicitations, for they will surely die in a
few days. On the other hand, provided the woman is shrewd enough, she
can invariably tell whether she is dealing with the real man or not—she
has only to look at the left foot; in the case of a spirit wooer, this
is always minus the big toe. During February, 1910, an Indian came and
gave me particulars of his wife's death, with details as to name, place,
and surrounding circumstances. The wife had been out getting firewood in
the bush, and had unexpectedly met what she had believed to be her
husband. When she got home there was her husband lying in his hammock;
she expressed surprise at seeing him, still more so when he assured her
that he had not been away from the house that day. Like a good wife, she
told him what had happened to her. Within the week the woman died.

   <span id="pp_98"></span>**98.**[\*](#pp_98.md) An unusual form of Arawak
Bush Spirit is that of the scrub-turkey (*Tinamus* sp.)—a woman's leg:
there are several references, however, to a leg in the folk-lore
([Sects. *38*](aflg02.htm#pp_38), [*208*](aflg13.htm#pp_208.md),
[*362*](aflg20.htm#pp_362).md). The connection between this astral limb and
the bird under consideration is that when the "leg" is above the horizon
just before daybreak, then will the scrub-turkey's "call" be heard.<span

   <span id="pp_99"></span>**99.**[\*](#pp_99.md) The Hebus are more or
less hairy beings, recognizable in a near view by the absence of
buttocks, their place being taken by a fire-hearth, with glowing embers,
giving rise to the name Huta-kurakura, "Red-back," which is often
applied to these folk ([Sects. *21*](aflg02.htm#pp_21.md),
[*27*](aflg02.htm#pp_27).md). Another peculiarity they possess is the
extraordinary prominence of the eye-brows (supra-orbital region), which
prevents them having a look at the skies except when standing on their
heads ([Sect. *22*](aflg02.htm#pp_22).md). Perhaps this conception is a
survival of the custom of artificial head-compression which certainly
used to be practised in the Guianas. As is the case with the Yurokons,
Hebus may sometimes appear in the form of skulls or skeletons ([Sect.
*26*](aflg02.htm#pp_26).md). Like all other Forest Spirits they have strong
patriarchal tendencies. They seem to be specially digtinguished by the
size of their purses \[scrotums\].

   <span id="pp_100"></span>**100.**[\*](#pp_100.md) Of the Immawari I can
not get much information, there being few reliable old Akawai in my
district: on the authority of Warraus, however, these Spirits have two
immense teeth protruding from their stomachs. Had elephants roamed the
country within recent geological periods, one could perhaps have
obtained an insight into the origin of so extraordinary a belief: on the
other hand it is possible that it may be an idea borrowed from the
African ([Sect. *113*](aflg08.htm#pp_113).md).

   <span id="pp_101"></span>**101.**[\*](#pp_101.md) So also with the
Yurokons. All I can glean is that, in common with the other Forest
Spirits, the face, body, and limbs are covered with a luxuriant growth
of hair. As to the Caypor, a kind of sylvan deity similar to the
Curupira, the belief in this being seems to be common to all the tribes
of the Tupi stock: according to the figure they dressed up at Ega (upper
Amazon) he is a bulky misshapen monster with red skin and long shaggy
red hair hanging halfway down his back (RWB, 279). The Curupari
(Jurupari, or Demon) is a mysterious being whose attributes are
uncertain, for they vary according to locality: sometimes he is
described as a kind of orang-outang, covered with long shaggy hair and
living in trees; at others he is said to have cloven feet and a
bright-red face . . . he sometimes comes down to the rocas to steal the
mandioca (HWB, 36) on the upper Aiary River (Rio Negro) the bad forest
demon is a bearded dwarf: he jeers the hunters and drives away the
quarry from right under their very noses. At times, he kills people with
his poisoned arrows (KG, <span class="small">I</span>, 137).

   <span id="pp_102"></span>**102.**[\*](#pp_102.md) But the Spirits of the
Forest need not necessarily be anthropomorphic. They may take the
likeness of animals (*e. g.*, "tigers," birds), an especially favored
feathered form being the goat-sucker <span id="page_175">p. 175</span>
(*Caprimulgus*). These physical attributes of some particular creature
or other they may permanently retain, or on occasion discard, as when
playing the rôle of a *kanaima*, or blood-avenger. At the head of the
Arapu River near Roraima "in traversing the country between Waetipu and
Ipelemouta . . . we were startled by a most singular prolonged cry. . .
. The Indians . . . said that the sound must have proceeded from some
Arecuna who, having killed one of his own people, had been turned into a
wild animal" (Bro, 123). Among the Trios of Surinam certain of these
Spirits are Akalamano, the carrion-vulture (*Sarcorhamphus*); Soni, a
kind of vulture or falcon, etc. As with animals, so in the case of
birds, those of them which are Bush Spirits bent on inflicting
punishment, in the way of blood revenge or otherwise, upon poor mortal
man, may be killed by him with impunity. "One small bird which in the
early morning and in the evening flits, with a peculiar and shrill
whistle, over the savannahs and some times approaches the Indian
settlements, is looked upon with especial distrust. When one of these is
shot, the Indians suppose that they have one enemy less, and they burn
it, taking great care that not even a single feather escapes to be blown
about by the wind; on a windy day on the savannahs I have seen upwards
of a dozen men and women eagerly chasing single floating feathers of
these birds" (IT, 332). On the other hand, there are certain birds—owls,
goat-suckers, and others (undoubtedly Bush Spirits in the sense that
they have been derived from human beings)—which must not be killed under
any pretence whatever. Such birds do not wish to injure "we Indians,"
but they often come to give us a warning or token. "You will never
persuade the negro to destroy these birds \[goat-suckers\], or get the
Indian to let fly his arrow at them. . . . They are receptacles for
departed souls, who come back again to earth; unable to rest for crimes
done in their days of nature; or they are expressly sent by Jumbo, or
Yabahou \[Yawahu\], to haunt cruel and hard-hearted masters, and
retaliate injuries received from them. . . . If it be heard close to the
negro's or Indian's hut, from that night misfortune sits brooding over
it; and they await the event in terrible suspense" (W, 177). Reference
has already been made to the "souls" of people departed being changed
into goat-suckers in the cavern of Guacharo ([Sect.
*82*](aflg05.htm#pp_82).md).

   <span id="pp_103"></span>**103.**[\*](#pp_103.md) The following legend,
current among both Caribs and Arawaks is of special interest in that the
bird in question is derived from the head of the Spirit itself:

   <span id="pp_104"></span>**104.**[\*](#pp_104.md) Speaking generally,
the Spirits of the Forest can be recognized, even when invisible, by
means of the whistling sound which they make. "The first night after
leaving Peaimah \[Mazaruni River\] we heard a long, loud, and most
melancholy whistle, proceeding from the direction of the depths of the
forest, at which some of the men exclaimed, in an awed tone of voice,
'The Didi' \[Dai-dai\]. Two or three times the whistle was repeated,
sounding like that made by a human being, beginning in a high key, and
dying slowly and gradually away in a low one" (Bro, 87). But instead of
a whistle ([Sect. *118*](aflg08.htm#pp_118).md) they may indicate their
presence by a noise somewhat like the neighing of a horse, in places
where horses are known not to exist. <span id="page_177">p. 177</span>
They are then described as Kawaiho-Kuyuha, evidently so called from the
corrupted Spanish form *caballo*, and with anthropophagous tastes have
unconquerable attraction toward infant at the breast and women encientes
(Da, 183). The Hebus, after dark, make sudden sharp noises like the
sounds caused by the breaking of branches: as stated elsewhere ([Sect.
*19*](aflg02.htm#pp_19).md), "You can always distinguish a Spirit's road
from any other pathway in the forest, because the Hebus occupying the
trees that lie alongside it are always, especially at night, striking
the branches and trunks, and so producing sharp crackling noises." Of
course, in the case of Bush Spirits that are zoomorphic the sounds they
make depend on the nature of the particular animal whose form they have
assumed. The Caribs in the Pomeroon plant a certain species of caladium
in the neighborhood of their settlement, to give warning of the approach
of a Yurokon at night: the plant gives a double signal, a soft yet
high-pitched whistling sound, and at the same time somehow contrives to
shake the hammock with force sufficient to wake the sleeper and warn him
of the coming danger. The following extract is from Bates, with
reference to the lower Amazon: "At one time I had a Mameluco youth in my
service . . . he always went with me in the forest: in fact I could not
get him to go alone, and whenever he heard any of the strange noises
mentioned above \[due to the Curupira\] he used to tremble with fear"
(HWB, 36). Dance (262) writes on this same subject of what the duties of
a traveler are, and how the influences of evil Bush Spirits may be
avoided ([Sect. *128*](aflg08.htm#pp_128).md).

   <span id="pp_105"></span>**105.**[\*](#pp_105.md) Bush Spirits may also
be recognized through the sense of smell. "When the Island Caribs smell
something offensive in a place, they will say 'The Evil Spirit (Maboya)
is here: let us therefore go away.' . . . They also give the name of
Maboya to certain plants, to toadstools, of a bad odor, and to
eyerything that is capable of imparting dread to them" (RoP, 464). The
Pomeroon Arawaks have the same idea.

   <span id="pp_106"></span>**106.**[\*](#pp_106.md) Bush Spirits are
certainly very clever people; nothing comes amiss to them, and they can
even bring the dead to life. They may render themselves invisible
([Sect. *119*](aflg08.htm#pp_119).md).

   <span id="pp_107"></span>**107.**[\*](#pp_107.md) Certain of the Forest
Spirits have come from the bodies of old-time medicine-men: the
present-day celebrant invokes them with his rattle ([Sect.
*309*](aflg17.htm#pp_309).md). Such Spirits may be considered beneficent in
the sense of assisting the piai by giving him information concerning the
source of the illness from which his patient is suffering, and in other
ways. Evidently others have been kindly disposed occasionally in that
they have conferred blessings and other gifts upon mankind. Thus, Arawak
legends point to the Spirits of the Forest as the introducers among them
of the flute made from the femoral bone of animals, and according to
Akawai tales, of the *sewehekuru*, or lace-work of hard nutshells tied
on the legs to give proper time to the movements in dancing (Da, 184).
Sometimes these Spirits do positive good, as in <span id="page_179">p.
179</span> the Jurupari festival, whereby sicknesses can be dispelled,
and large wounds healed (KG, <span class="small">I</span>, 320).

   <span id="pp_108"></span>**108.**[\*](#pp_108.md) Sufficient has already
been said to indicate that the Spirits of the Forest may have their good
points as well as bad; they may indeed have in their nature more of the
imp than the rogue. They have not always borne bad reputations, but the
very large majority of them certainly do so now. The Caribs, however,
admit that they themselves are responsible for this, and concurrently
for the introduction of pain, misery, and death.

   <span id="pp_109"></span>**109.**[\*](#pp_109.md) The general tendency
of these Spirits, however, is to do bad, the degree of wickedness of
which they can be guilty varying with <span id="page_180">p. 180</span>
circumstances and locality. Such a Spirit for instance may "be believed
in simply as a mischievous imp, who is at the bottom of all those
mishaps of their daily life, the causes of which are not very immediate
or obvious to their dull understandings" (HWB, 381). When in the
manufacture of their native drinks anything goes wrong with the
fermentation, the Indians ascribe it to Spirit machinations. The
following Warrau story is illustrative of this belief.

   If an Indian loses his way in the forest, the Spirit is the cause.
The Caribs, however, know how to circumvent the latter, by making a
string puzzle, which is left on the pathway: the object of this puzzle
consists in removing, without cutting or breaking, an endless string
from off two sticks upon which it has been placed (see [fig. 1](#p180).md).
The Spirit coming along sees the puzzle, starts examining it, and tries
to get the string off: indeed, so engrossed with it does he become, that
he forgets all about the wanderer, who is now free to find the <span
id="page_181">p. 181</span> road again. In this connection, it is
interesting to note that Bates speaks of his Indian boy, on the lower
Amazon, making a charm to protect them from the Curupari: "For this
purpose he took a young palm-leaf, plaited it, and formed it into a ring
which he hung to a branch on our track" (HWB, 35).<span
id="page_181_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_181_note_1.md)

   <span id="pp_110"></span>**110.**[\*](#pp_110.md) On the Orinoco, the
Mapoyes blamed the Spirits of the Forest for damage to their fields, the
Guayquiries held them responsible for all their strifes and disputes,
the Guamos ascribed sickness to their occult powers, while the Betoyes
regarded them as the cause of the deaths of all their children whose
necks they broke so silently as not to be felt (G, <span
class="small">II</span>, 23-26). This belief in their being the cause of
sickness and death is universal throughout the Guianas. Among the
Arawaks it is the Yawahu-shimara, or Spirit's Arrow, which has the
property of inflicting pains or ills, the visible causes of which are
not discoverable. The Arawaks, however, are not alone in this
conception: it is apparently shared by the Caribs, from whom I learned
the following:

   <span id="pp_111"></span>**111.**[\*](#pp_111.md) In Cayenne, it is
Hyorokon, the Bush Spirit, who strangles some, corrupts the blood of
others, covers this one with ulcers, and that one inflicts with
jaundice. The same Indians believe also in a Spirit called Chinay \[thus
far not identified by me\], who is a real cannibal and sucks their
blood, which accounts for their being so thin when sick (PBa, 206). This
belief (in the work of the Spirits) explains a peculiar trait of Indian
character which would otherwise be inexplicable. Believing that a child
who has just fallen into the river or has gotten beyond its depth is
being drowned by the will or agency of a Spirit, the Indian who passes
by and sees the struggling child is afraid to incur the wrath of that
Spirit, by any interference on his part to save the child. He thinks he
will have done his utmost duty as a neighbor by informing the parents of
the fate of their child <span id="page_182">p. 182</span> (DA, 290). So
again, because sickness is regarded chiefly as due to Spirits, the
method of cure is therefore mainly directed to driving them out by means
of presents, through the agency of the piai, etc.<span
id="page_182_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_182_note_1.md)

   <span id="pp_112"></span>**112.**[\*](#pp_112.md) Death, sickness, and
other calamities may be inflicted by the Spirits upon mankind, not only
out of pure malevolence, but also by way of punishment for
transgressions committed against the recognized rules of law and order
as understood in Indian society. The other calamities just referred to
include, *inter alia*, transformation into various beasts and birds, and
spontaneous disappearance. The following five legends from the Warraus
and Arawaks illustrate these points pretty clearly.

   <span id="pp_117"></span>**117.**[\*](#pp_117.md) The Spirits of the
Forest are blessed, or cursed, with strong patriarchal tendencies, are
very fond of women, and of human flesh generally. They have an
unconquerable attraction toward suckling babes and pregnant women (Da,
183), a statement which appears to be confirmed in the accompanying
legends. I do not know the reason of their supposed relationship to
children, but certain it is that among the Pomeroon Arawaks, it was the
Yawahus who were asked by the piais to bring babies to those women who
wanted them ([Sect. *302*](aflg17.htm#pp_302).md). On the upper Orinoco it
was the Bush Spirit Iolok-iamo who, together with the tikitiki bird, was
considered responsible for the deformities of new-born children (AVH,
<span class="small">II</span>, 249).

   <span id="pp_121"></span>**121.**[\*](#pp_121.md) Since Spirits are
supposed to have a peculiar fondness for tobacco ([Sect.
*27*](aflg02.htm#pp_27).md), and to be continually inhaling its fumes, the
smoke of the fragrant weed is largely used in their invocation
([Sect.](aflg17.htm#pp_308.md) <span id="page_192">p. 192</span>
[*308*](aflg17.htm#pp_308).md). Among the Caribs, the first two Spirits
that are called on by the medicine-man with his rattle are Mawári
([Sect. *309*](aflg17.htm#pp_309).md) and Makai-abáni. The latter puts in
an appearance with the tobacco smoke, in which he is enveloped:
otherwise he remains in the rattle (*maraka*), coming out only when this
is shaken. The former's weakness for tobacco constitutes the subject of
the Carib legend here given.

   <span id="pp_123"></span>**123.**[\*](#pp_123.md) Whenever my Indian
friends wished to impress me with the power and importance of any of
their legendary beings, they invariably ascribed to it great size: thus,
a black tiger as big as a house meant a very dangerous brute; a bat as
big as a tree indicated the "vampire," that sucks people's blood at
night with fatal results. I learned that for similar reasons these
Forest Spirits are always associated with unusually big things ([Sects.
*27*](aflg02.htm#pp_27), [*147*](aflg09.htm#pp_147).md). Both Arawaks and
Warraus have a story of this nature: I attach the former version.

   <span id="pp_124"></span>**124.**[\*](#pp_124.md) To conclude this
natural history, so to speak, of the Spirits of the Forest, it may be
mentioned that, with very rare exceptions, as the Mansinskiri ([Sect.
*97*](aflg08.htm#pp_97).md), they shrink from exposure to sunlight or
firelight, from hearing their names called, or particulars of their
origin talked about. This idea explains why an Indian will almost
invariably refuse to tell these spirit-legends in the daytime, when
<span id="page_194">p. 194</span> he might be heard by the particular
Spirit spoken about and subsequently be mysteriously punished.<span
id="page_194_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_194_note_1.md) There are certainly many
examples in the Indian folk-lore illustrative of the dire results
consequent on mentioning either the Spirit's name or his particular
origin ([Sects. *99*](aflg08.htm#pp_99), [*133*](aflg09.htm#pp_133.md),
[*135*](aflg09.htm#pp_135), [*176*](aflg11.htm#pp_176).md).

   <span id="pp_125"></span>**125.**[\*](#pp_125.md) To mimic the sounds of
their voices is of course as bad as laughing at Spirits ([Sect.
*59*](aflg04.htm#pp_59).md) or mentioning their names.

   <span id="pp_126"></span>**126.**[\*](#pp_126.md) And so, when all is
said and done, it is just as well that we should be circumspect in our
conduct and not incur the enmity, with all its attendant consequences,
of these denizens of the forest. Indeed, it is far better to keep out of
the clutches of these Spirits altogether, and give them a wide berth.
Just consider, for instance, what happened to the Warrau who would
insist on associating with them.

   <span id="pp_129"></span>**129.**[\*](#pp_129.md) Should unforeseen
circumstances, however, force one into close quarters with Bush Spirits,
various procedures may be adopted to get rid of them. Warraus and
Makusis took measures to exorcise evil spirits from the dancing-ground.
Schomburgk describes how this was effected by the former tribe:
Proceeding slowly to the spot chosen, with clanging Thevetia seeds, the
Hoho-hit, or Master <span id="page_197">p. 197</span> of the Ceremonies,
etc., blew upon a small flute, in imitation of a monkey's voice, which
regulated the movement. Reaching there, the others made a circle round
him, when a second signal on the flute warned them all to lay their
instruments on the ground, and bend themselves down, until he had
murmured some unintelligible words. At a third signal they picked up
their instruments, straightened themselves, and were now allowed to pipe
away (ScR, <span class="small">I</span>, 153). With the Makusis, a
deafening universal shout, like dogs howling, constitutes on every
occasion the introduction and finale of their combined games and dances
wherewith to expel the evil spirits from the neighborhood (ScR, <span
class="small">II</span>, 194). A somewhat similar course was followed on
the Orinoco at the wedding festivities of the Guayquiries and Mapojes.
As soon as day breaks, there comes from the bush close at hand a dancing
party with flutes and kettledrums, which circuits backward and forward
round the houses of the brides, whence presently there emerges an old
woman with a plate of food, which she presents to one of the dancers;
they then all return at top speed to the bush, where, scattering the
plate and food, one of them will shout, "Here! you devil of a dog
(*perro demonio*)! Take this food, and don't come and upset our fun!"
(G, <span class="small">I</span>, 160). To prevent the Bush Spirits
coming into the house, a hunter, on his return from the chase, will
shout out the name Shimarabu-akaradani ([Sect. *95*](aflg08.htm#pp_95).md)
before entering ([Sect. *124*](aflg08.htm#pp_124).md). Other methods may be
adopted for withstanding the vengeance of the Spirits of those animals
which the hunter has just returned from slaughtering ([Sect.
*243*](aflg15.htm#pp_243).md). An alligator skull stuck up in a Carib house
will prevent the Yurokon entering it ([Sect. *251*](aflg15.htm#pp_251).md).

   <span id="pp_130"></span>**130.**[\*](#pp_130.md) So also, when
traveling in the bush, forest, and other places, where all these Spirits
are lurking, one should never be without a companion, and it is always
advisable to satisfy oneself as to the cause and origin of any unusual
sound. "The Indian always prefers to travel in large numbers: his dread
of evil spirits is so great, that he will subject himself to great
inconvenience rather than travel alone" (ScG, 262). "It is a duty to
one's self to turn and look about when a stick falls from a tree, or
when a crackling of twigs is heard: for there walk together always a bad
and a good spirit ([Sect. *84*](aflg05.htm#pp_84).md)—the one wishing to
injure, the other to protect living people. At sight of any one in the
forest or on the river, the evil spirit is ready to harm: but the good
spirit says, 'Stay! he may be a friend of mine. Let us see if he will
show his face when I call.' He then breaks a twig or a branch. The
person is saved from harm if he looks around, but is in danger of being
hurt if he will not look." (Da, 262.) Whenever Indians—Warraus and
others—traveling in the bush hear any unusual cry or uncanny noise, they
will sing out, "Show who you are, or else bring something to eat!" or
some similar expression ([Sects. *116*](aflg08.htm#pp_116.md),
[*130*](aflg08.htm#pp_130).md). If a Spirit is met on the road, the Caribs
know how to divert its attention ([Sect. *109*](aflg08.htm#pp_109).md) with
a string puzzle.

You?" "Yes, I called you; you are a nice wench, too, and had better come
home with me." She being agreeable, went home, and lived with him a long
time. But his people were continually nagging at her. You see, being
really a frog, she had no waist, her hips were narrow and her foot was
long; and accordingly her step-parents would always be calling her
names, as "Froggie, where's your waist?" "Small-hip," "Lanky-foot." Her
life, once full of joy, was now replete with misery, so she determined
upon returning to her own people. She went into the bush, and her man,
following the trail, got almost in touch with her; but just then she
jumped into a little puddle and disappeared. He put his hand in, and
felt all the way round, but no further trace of her could he find. You
can always hear her, however, at the commencement of the rainy season.

folk-lore. Scalping was practised both in the Guianas and elsewhere in
South America, for example, in Ecuador (AS, 90).

<span id="page_176_note_3"></span>[3](#page_176_fr_3.md) Brett's version
([BrB, 176](../lmbg/lmbg5b.htm#page_176).md) is as follows: Peaima was an
Arai-dai who had become dissatisfied with his coarse and matted looks
and wished them to be made like those of human beings. Pahadun, a
captive, undertook to gratify him; he shaved his head close, and on the
raw surface poured pepper seeds. Thus crowned with pepper seeds, the
monster tried to slay the man in a long series of adventures, but the
man with lying tongue outwitted his pursuer.

<span id="page_183_note_1"></span>[1](#page_183_fr_1.md) It is not an
uncommon thing to see an Indian who has already a wife and family of
young children bringing up a little girl who will be his second wife
(Br, 352).

<span id="footnotes_page_185">p. 185</span>

<span id="page_185_note_1"></span>[1](#page_185_fr_1.md) This word is the
Arawak term for an eye-socket; it is applied to a particular variety of
basket, characterized by having an oblong concavity in its base, a
peculiarity which the name suggests.

<span id="footnotes_page_186">p. 186</span>

<span id="page_186_note_1"></span>[1](#page_186_fr_1.md) *Ija-sanuka* is
Warrau for 'cousin,' the word used by the narrator. An Indian will greet
any other female of his tribe in three ways: If older, as 'mother' or
'auntie'; if about the same age, as 'sister' or 'cousin'; and if much
younger, as 'child,' 'daughter,' etc.

<span id="page_186_note_2"></span>[2](#page_186_fr_2.md) Kokerite is used
only for the blow-pipe, that is, poisoned arrows.

<span id="page_186_note_3"></span>[3](#page_186_fr_3.md) The Warrau word
for 'uncle' as used here is *daku*: not only does this mean the parents'
brother but practically every male of about corresponding age.

<span id="footnotes_page_187">p. 187</span>

<span id="page_187_note_1"></span>[1](#page_187_fr_1.md) Among all these
Indians, the husband becomes a member of his wife's family. His
permanent retention of his wife depends on the satisfactory completion
by him of various tasks, as the cutting or a field and the building or a
house. The recognition of him and his acceptance of the responsibilities
or the position as the lawful heir or his wife's family whose interests
he has henceforth to protect and safeguard, commence with the appearance
of the baby. So-called "marriage" to the Indian is a question of neither
morality nor ethics, but one of policy. He takes up with a woman so that
she may bear him children, especially daughters, whose husbands will
have to provide for his old age, as by custom from time immemorial
ordained. If she proves barren, he but naturally takes unto himself
another. Without the advent of offspring, no woman is wanted. Hence, in
those districts where missionaries have established themselves, the
celebration of the marriage contract very generally takes place only
after the bride-elect has proved herself an ideal woman by becoming
pregnant. Sterility is regarded as a shame and disgrace by both sexes.
Any physically developed woman, married or single, so afflicted, is
described as a "mule" by English-speaking Indians; the Arawaks speak of
such a female as *massoronto* (barren) in the sense of degradation and
reproach.

<span id="footnotes_page_190">p. 190</span>

<span id="page_190_note_1"></span>[1](#page_190_fr_1.md) When a person
suddenly disappears from any place without leaving a trace, under
circumstances which in plain English would be described as murder and
disposal of the body, the Indians ascribe it to the Evil Spirit.

<span id="page_190_note_2"></span>[2](#page_190_fr_2.md) Among many savage
races, the husband has marital rights over his wife's sisters, and vice
versa; I have found several traces of this communal form or marriage in
the Guianas.—W. E. R.

<span id="footnotes_page_191">p. 191</span>

<span id="page_191_note_1"></span>[1](#page_191_fr_1.md) The "knife" which
gave rise to the girl's name was probably the labba-tooth instrument
employed by the old-time Arawaks. Among the other Indians there are
records of knives and kindred implements being made from the teeth of
the pirai fish, from a piece of bamboo, etc.

<span id="page_191_note_2"></span>[2](#page_191_fr_2.md) Intimate friends
call one another by the identical name: the same thing occurs among men
([Sect. *265*](aflg15.htm#pp_265).md).

<span id="footnotes_page_192">p. 192</span>

<span id="page_192_note_1"></span>[1](#page_192_fr_1.md) The stool upon
which the Carib medicine-man sits during the incantation is generally in
the form of an alligator.

<span id="footnotes_page_193">p. 193</span>

<span id="page_193_note_1"></span>[1](#page_193_fr_1.md) According to Dance
(p. 202), the large woody fungi growing out of the fallen and decayed
trunks of trees are named by the Demerara River Arawaks "kamara-sana"
and also the "Bush-devil's cassava bread."

<span id="page_193_note_2"></span>[2](#page_193_fr_2.md) In the Warrau
version of this story the Bush Spirit asks the man to bring him peppers,
but he means a scorpion; then a hammock, but he means a tiger, whose
color-stripes represent the cotton "cross-ties;" and finally a
hammock-rope, but he means a snake.

<span id="footnotes_page_194">p. 194</span>

<span id="page_194_note_1"></span>[1](#page_194_fr_1.md) We ourselves are
blessed with a corresponding weakness in believing that the best
occasion for a real good ghost-story is when gathered around the
fireside, and that there is much truth in the old adage, "Talk of the
Devil, and He is sure to appear."

<span id="page_194_note_2"></span>[2](#page_194_fr_2.md) A man *never*
takes his wife or child with him on the actual hunt, where one or the
other would only be in his way. She always accompanies him if he
proposes being out some days, when he will leave her during the daytime
at the temporary shed, or banab, while he himself searches the
neighborhood for game, returning to her before nightfall. As a matter of
fact, even when men join together on a hunting expedition, and the banab
has been made, it is the rule rather than the exception for each to go
his own way and thus the better scour the surrounding country in all
directions. It is the wife's business, if present, to erect the
babracote, as well as dry and cook the food.

<span id="footnotes_page_195">p. 195</span>

<span id="page_195_note_1"></span>[1](#page_195_fr_1.md) These Rain-frogs
are peculiar in that they make an especially loud noise at the time of
the first rainy season after which they cease.

<span id="page_195_note_2"></span>[2](#page_195_fr_2.md) This is an
exclamation denoting astonishment or surprise.

<span id="page_195_note_3"></span>[3](#page_195_fr_3.md) In a Carib version
of the story, it is a Yurokon by name of Araiyokó who gives the brother
his pointed feet, by way of punishment.
