## C<span class="small">HAPTER</span> IV CREATION OF MAN, PLANTS, AND ANIMALS

   <span class="small">Man was either brought here from Cloud-land, etc.
(*[51](#pp_51)*), or was created here (*[52](#pp_52)*.md); in the latter
case, from Animals, as Tigers (*[53](#pp_53)*.md), Snakes
(*[54](#pp_54)-56*), from Plants (*[57](#pp_57)*.md), or from Rocks and
Stones (*[58](#pp_58)*.md).  
   Certain Plants were derived from human beings or Bush Spirits
(*[59](#pp_59)*), or grew upon a Wonderful Tree (*[60](#pp_60)-61*.md).
Some animals arose from the Spirits of Mortal Men
(*[62](#pp_62)*.md).</span>

   <span id="pp_51"></span>**51.**[\*](#pp_51.md) Certain tribes believe
that man, already made, reached this world from elsewhere, while others
claim that he developed here, where he either merely grew into being or
was indebted to some Master Spirit for coming into existence at all. His
presence on the planet, however, would not seem to give rise on his part
to claims superior to those of various animals, including birds.

   In those cases where Man, already created, reached this "vale of
tears" from elsewhere, his place of origin appears to have been
Cloud-land, the Skies, and countries beyond them, according to views
held by Caribs, Arawaks, and Warraus.

   The first-mentioned hold that mankind descended from on high . . .
unfortunately, the clouds which had brought them down receded and so
left them behind. Being hungry, they were forced to eat earth, which
they baked into cakes, and followed the beasts and birds to see what
wild fruits they were accustomed to devour, and so learned to help
themselves ([BrB, 103](../lmbg/lmbg3b.htm#page_103).md). According to the
Island Caribs, "Louquo was the first man and a Carib. He was not made of
any other body; he descended from the sky and lived a long time on
earth;" in fact it was he who made it. "He had a large nostril from
which, as also from an incision in his thighs, he produced the first men
(BBR, 226-7). Bolingbroke talks of Longwo as being the first man, in the
Indian belief of the "central parts" of Guiana: "Certain vapors, or
spirits, to which the savages ascribe thunders and fevers, are the
objects of their fear and propitiatory worship. They do not ascribe a
human form to these divinities, but conceive them to have brought hither
the first man,whom they call Longwo" (Bol, 371). The Korobohána, one of
the many group-divisions of the Arawaks . . . believe that they
originally came from above the clouds. The weight of a heavy woman broke
the rope by which they were descending: and communication was thus cut
off between those who had reached the ground and those remaining above.
The Great Spirit, pitying the latter, supplied them with wings and
plumage; and they came down to colonize the trees above the heads of
their <span id="page_142">p. 142</span> brethren—still privileged to
live near, and to converse with them, though changed into kuriaka
parrots ([BrB, 179](../lmbg/lmbg5b.htm#page_179).md).

   The Warrau version of their own origin is very similar. Okonoróté one
day went hunting for a rare bird—in those times the Warraus lived up
above the sky and the only creatures they knew of were birds—and it was
many a long day before he succeeded in locating it, though he did so at
last. Letting fly an arrow he transfixed it, but on rushing up to the
place where it had fallen, there was nothing visible but a big hole in
the ground through which he could see the deer, peccary, and other
animals disporting themselves on the green plains below. With the help
of a cotton rope he descended to earth, and saw jaguars, snakes, and
wild beasts devouring their prey. He shot a young deer, cooked the
flesh, and finding how sweet it tasted, took some of the flesh back with
him on his ascent up the rope, home again. Needless to say, all the
Warraus were only too eager to accompany him when he repeated his
descent, which they did in safety, one after the other until the very
last—and this happened to be a woman who got wedged in the aperture, and
could neither get up nor down. The hole being thus filled up, the
Warraus have never been able to reach their old home again ([BrB,
55](../lmbg/lmbg2b.htm#page_55).md). The name of this woman who thus stuck
half-way is Okona-kura, the Warraus still recognizing her as the Morning
Star.

   Certain of the Salivas did not hesitate to proclaim themselves
children of the Sun (G, <span class="small">I</span>, 113).

   <span id="pp_52"></span>**52.**[\*](#pp_52.md) In those cases where man,
as such, put in his first appearance on this world's stage (*i. e.*, as
in many other places was created on the earth) there is no evidence
available pointing to the existence of any belief that his creation took
place out of nothing, either spontaneously or at the instance of some
Master Spirit, or some person, or thing. Indeed, the two or three
examples which might be claimed in support of the existence of such
evidence are very dubious. Schomburgk notes an Arawak tradition, which I
can not find elsewhere, that man was created by Kururumanni, and woman
by Kulimina ([Sect. *19*](aflg02.htm#pp_19).md); he mentions also that the
former was subservient to Aluberi, the Supreme Spirit (ScR, <span
class="small">II</span>, 319). Among the Maipures of the Orinoco,
however, it was the Supreme Being Purrunaminari who created man, but the
traveler just cited admits that the above tradition, among others
reported by Gili, shows a seemingly evident admixture of Christian ideas
(ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 320). So also does the alleged
Akawai legend that Makunaima, admittedly the Supreme Being, put his son,
the first man, in charge of all the other animals that he had just made
([BrB, 126](../lmbg/lmbg4b.htm#page_126).md). On the other hand, the Indian
seemingly can conceive of man's origin only from something already
existing in the world of nature immediately surrounding him. And so, in
considering the reputed origins <span id="page_143">p. 143</span> of the
various tribes, the belief becomes more and more prominent that
Mankind—and by Mankind each Indian means the original ancestors of his
own people—was originally derived, with or without the assistance of
pre-existing agencies, from various animals and plants, from rocks,
stones, and rivers.

   <span id="pp_53"></span>**53.**[\*](#pp_53.md) Among various animal
forms, "tigers" (jaguars) and snakes constitute the commonest sources
from which peoples claiming an animal pedigree have been derived. Carib
history furnishes excellent examples in this respect, because we have
records not only of what they themselves thought about their own origin,
but of what other peoples also believed concerning it. Thus the Achagua
maintain that the Caribs are legitimate descendants of tigers . . .
*chavi* in their language signifies a tiger, whence they deduce
*chavinavi*, "arising from a tiger," which is their term for a Carib.
Other branches of the Achagua explain the term more satisfactorily thus:
*chavi* in their language is a tiger, and *chavina* is the spear, lance,
pike, pole, and from these two words, "tiger" and "pike," they derive
the word *chavinavi*, as being the children of tigers with pikes (G,
<span class="small">I</span>, 112).

   <span id="pp_54"></span>**54.**[\*](#pp_54.md) The Salivas say that the
son of Puru conquered and put to death a horrible snake that had been
destroying and devouring the nations of the Orinoco; but that as soon as
the monster began to putrefy, certain large worms began to develop in
her entrails, and that from each worm there finally arose a Carib Indian
and his woman; and that in the same way that the snake was so bloody an
enemy of all those nations, so her children were savage, inhuman, and
cruel (G, <span class="small">I</span>, 111).

   <span id="pp_55"></span>**55.**[\*](#pp_55.md) The Warrau version, like
that recorded by Brett in his Legend of Korobona ([BrB,
64](../lmbg/lmbg2b.htm#page_64).md) refers to a special water-snake, and
the account which I now give is almost word for word as related to me:

<span id="story_8"></span>

   <span id="pp_56"></span>**56.**[\*](#pp_56.md) The Carib version of the
story was told me on the upper Pomeroon, by probably one of the oldest
local survivors of the tribe, who spoke somewhat as follows:

>    The water-camudi had an Indian woman for a sweetheart. During the
> day he took the form of a snake; at night, he was "a people" like
> myself. The couple used to meet at the water side, and hence the
> girl's parents knew nothing about their being so fond of each other.
> After she became pregnant, a baby camudi was born. The little one used
> to appear when she reached the river bank, swim about, and after a
> time return to its nesting place. Now, as she stayed so long each time
> at the water side, the old father said to his two sons, "What is the
> matter with your sister? Why does she take so long to bathe?"
> Accordingly, the brothers, watching her go down to the stream, videt
> serpentem parvam exire atque serpentem magnam intrare. They saw also
> the huge camudi bring his infant son something to eat and saw the baby
> take the father's place when the latter left. When they reached home,
> the sons complained to the old man about what they had seen: he told
> them to kill both the snakes. So on the next occasion they killed the
> huge camudi, and seizing the baby serpent, carried it far away back
> into the bush, where they chopped it up into many small pleces. Some
> months afterward when hunting in the neighborhood, the brothers heard
> a great noise and the sound of voices coming from the very same
> direction, and going to ascertain the cause, found four houses in the
> identical spot where they had cut up the baby camudi, all occupied by
> Indians who had grown out of the fragments of the snake. In the first

   <span id="pp_57"></span>**57.**[\*](#pp_57.md) The vegetable world takes
a share of the responsibility for the derivation of man. There is either
a story of some fabulous Tree of Life, or reference to certain
well-known plants, as the silk-cotton tree <span id="page_145">p.
145</span> (*Bombax*) or ité palm (*Mauritia*). The Akawai and Makusi
idea of creation is that, co-eval with Makunaima, there was a large
tree, and that, having mounted this tree, with a stone ax he cut pieces
of wood which, having been thrown into the river, became animated beings
(HiC, 244; ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 319). The Arawaks hold
that from his seat on the silk-cotton tree, the Mighty One scattered
twigs and bark in the air, on the land, and in the water, and that from
these pieces arose the birds, beasts, reptiles, fish, and also men and
women. The sire of the Arawaks was Wadili ([BrB,
7](../lmbg/lmbg1b.htm#page_7).md). Some of the Salivas affirmed that
certain trees used to bear men and women for fruit, and that these
people were their ancestors (G, <span class="small">I</span>, 113). The
Maipures and, according to Humboldt similarly the Tamanacs, say that in
early days the whole earth was submerged in water, only two people, a
man and a woman, saving themselves on the top of the high mountain
Tamanaku; that as they wandered around the mountain in deep distress
over the loss of their friends, they heard a voice which told them to
throw the fruits of the *Mauritia* behind them over their shoulders, and
that as they did so, the fruit which the man threw became men, and that
which the woman threw, women (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 320).
Certain of the Achagua Indians pretend that they are the children of
tree-trunks and from this allusion call themselves Aycuba-verrenais (G,
<span class="small">I</span>, 114). Loku-daia is the mythic Indian tree,
growing out of a grave, which is said by some Indians to have been the
root from which they sprang. When it was cut down, it was transformed
into a rapid, whence the name of one of the Demerara River rapids (Da,
195).

   According to the idea current among the Trios, people were originally
like wood, stone, etc., and had no faces (Go, 12). The manufacture of a
woman out of a plum tree ([Sect. *29*](aflg02.htm#pp_29).md), and the tree
changing into a man ([Sect. *9*](aflg02.htm#pp_9).md), should also be noted
here.

   <span id="pp_58"></span>**58.**[\*](#pp_58.md) Not a few legends ([Sect.
*158*](aflg09.htm#pp_158).md) connected with the origin of the tribes
contain curious examples of animism relative to earth, rocks, and stones
([Sect. *171*](aflg11.htm#pp_171).md). The Mapoyas, the Salivas, and the
Otomacs, all three of them Orinoco tribes, had beliefs of this nature
(G, <span class="small">I</span>, 113). The last-mentioned used to say
that a stone made up of three parts, arranged in the form of a pyramid
upon the summit of a rock called Barraguan, was their earliest
ancestress; and that another monstrous rock, which served as the summit
of another pinnacle, two leagues distant, was their first ancestor.
Being consistent, they believed that all the rocks and stones of which
the said Barraguan (a high promontory of large rocks, bearing hardly a
particle of earth) was formed, were each of them one of their
predecessors. Although these Otomacs buried their dead, they dug up the
skulls at the end of a year, and placed them in and among the crevices
and holes between the rocks and stones constituting the promontory
mentioned, <span id="page_146">p. 146</span> where they expected them in
their turn to change into stone. The Mapoyas would call such a stone as
that serving for the summit of the pinnacle just mentioned, Uruana,
describing it as the source of their tribe, and would be delighted at
any one speaking of them as Uruanayes in allusion to this fact. These
tombs, caverns filled with bones, in the strait of Barraguan, are again
referred to by Humboldt (<span class="small">II</span>, 487). Some of
the Salivas would declare that they were children of the soil, and that
in former times the earth used to breed men and women in the same way
that it now produces thorns and hidden rocks (G, <span
class="small">I</span>, 113). According to the Makusi tradition,
Makunaima sent great waters: only one man escaped . . . this one man who
survived the flood threw stones behind him, and thus peopled the earth
anew (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 320). Those of the Achaguas
who believed in their origin from rivers distinguished themselves from
the the tree-trunk ones ([Sect. *57*](aflg04.htm#pp_57).md) by the name
Uni-verrenais (G, <span class="small">I</span>, 114).

   <span id="pp_59"></span>**59.**[\*](#pp_59.md) The Yahuna Indians of the
Apaporis River have a belief in certain palm trees having been derived
from the ashes of a human being ([Sect. *163A*](aflg10.htm#pp_163A).md).
The Arawaks and Caribs hold similar views as to the origin of certain
cultivated plants. In an Arawak story it is one of the Bush Spirits
which supplies man with the first fruit plants, whereas the Carib
version gives a wonderful tree itself as the source ([Sect.
*60*](aflg04.htm#pp_60).md). The following is the Arawak story:

<span id="story_10"></span>

   <span id="pp_60"></span>**60.**[\*](#pp_60.md) The statement has been
already made, on Carib authority ([Sect. *51*](aflg04.htm#pp_51).md), that
mankind learned from the beasts and birds what wild fruits to devour.
But it was the Bunia bird which taught the Carib folk all about the
cultivated plants, which originally grew upon a certain wonderful tree,
and it happened in this way:

>    Time was when the Indians had no cassava to eat; they all starved.
> Animals and birds also had nothing to eat; they likewise starved. It
> was the Maipuri alone who, going out regularly every morning and
> returning home of an evening, always appeared sleek and fat. The

> Maipuri a long, long way into the bush, when he saw him pause under
> the shade of an immense tree and gather the fruit that had fallen.
> This tree was the Allepántepo, and very wonderful, in that everything

> many plantains, pines, and other things had fallen on the ground.

> not fall—so big was Allepántepo. They cut away for another ten days
> and still it would not fall. By this time their work had made them

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

   <span id="pp_61"></span>**61.**[\*](#pp_61.md) The above is the
tradition, almost word for word as it was told to me by an old Carib,
but no explanation was forthcoming as to the origin of the tree itself.
Brett however ascribes it to Tamosi ([BrB,
103](../lmbg/lmbg3b.htm#page_103)-114.md) in the same way that he gives
Makunaima credit ([BrB, 126](../lmbg/lmbg4b.htm#page_126).md) for the
similarly wonderful Akawai tree. In the latter case the immediately
preceding sentence, however, shows an undoubted bias due to Christian
influences: "Makunaima made all the beasts and birds, all of one speech,
bade them live in unity, and put his Son, the first man, in charge of
them." The same author gives also an addition to the story as above
narrated, by the mention of a fountain or swelling waters in the stump,
or under the roots, of this wonderful tree, the overflowing of which is
temporarily checked by means of a rugged rock (Carib) or an inverted
basket (Akawai). Owing to the reputed wickedness of the people in the
one case, and the mischief of a howling monkey in the other, the waters
are let loose, and a flood occurs, which overwhelms nearly everything,
most of the people being destroyed." Some try to escape by climbing a
high kokerite palm whose top reached the heavens, but a poor woman not
in a condition to climb led the way, and halfway up was turned into
stone by terror and exhaustion: none could help her and none could pass
over her, and all who tried to do so became rocks likewise. A few
survivors then climbed a komoo palm and so saved themselves" ([BrB,
106](../lmbg/lmbg3b.htm#page_106).md).

   <span id="pp_62"></span>**62.**[\*](#pp_62.md) Among the mainland
Indians, I can find no explanations current concerning the origin of the
first birds and beasts. Brett's statement that Makunaima made them
([BrB, 126](../lmbg/lmbg4b.htm#page_126).md) appears to lack confirmation.
The Island Caribs had a tradition that Louquo, their first man ([Sect.
*51*](aflg04.htm#pp_51).md), "made fishes out of scrapings and fragments of
cassava, which he threw into the water" (BBR, 227). Many an animal has
