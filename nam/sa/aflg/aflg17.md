## C<span class="small">HAPTER</span> XVII THE MEDIClNE-MAN

   <span class="small">Medicine-men practise what they preach: Names
(*[285](#pp_285)*); respected and feared both alive or dead and may be
given offerings (*[286](#pp_286)*), but occupy no position necessarily
distinctive, as captain of tribe (*[287](#pp_287)*).  
   Insignia and paraphernalia: bench (*[288](#pp_288)*), rattle
(*[289](#pp_289)*), doll or manikin, identical with idol or zemi of
Antilleans (*[290](#pp_290)*), quartz crystals (*[291](#pp_291)*);
miscellaneous kickshaws (*[292](#pp_292)*).  
   Office, hereditary (*[293](#pp_293)*). Female doctors
(*[294](#pp_294)*). Consulting-room (*[295](#pp_295)*). First Piai
(*[296](#pp_296)*). Apprenticeship and Installation
(*[297](#pp_297)*).  
   Power over Spirits: of animals (*[298](#pp_298)*), of himself (e. g.
invisibility) and of other Indians (*[299](#pp_299)*).  
   As interpreter of dreams (*[300](#pp_300)*); seer or prophet
(*[301](#pp_301)*); his general versatility (*[302](#pp_302)-303*);
guardian of the tribal traditions (*[304](#pp_304)*); the giver of
personal names (*[305](#pp_305)*); his treatment of sickness and disease
(*[306](#pp_306)*).  
   Disease and treatment: signification (*[307](#pp_307)*); usual
treatment by Arawak piai (*[308](#pp_308)*); by Carib
(*[309](#pp_309)*); by Galibi (*[310](#pp_310)*); by ? Oyampi
(*[311](#pp_311)*); by Makusi (*[312](#pp_312)*); by Indians of Caracas
(*[313](#pp_313)*); by Carib Islanders (*[314](#pp_314)*). Spirits
specially invoked in cure (*[315](#pp_315)*); objects extracted from
patients (*[316](#pp_316)*); dieting of patient's relatives and family
(*[317](#pp_317)*); medical fees (*[318](#pp_318)*); Quack doctors
(*[319](#pp_319)*).</span>

   <span id="pp_285"></span>**285.**[\*](#pp_285) There is abundant
evidence that the medicine-men practised what they preached, and had
every confidence in the powers with which they had been intrusted. "They
practise those incantations over their own sick children, and cause them
to be practised over themselves when sick" (BrA, 117). "They act the
farce on themselves when they are disordered: a practice which has not a
little contributed to overthrow all doubts of the sincerity of their
pretensions" (Ba, 314). "The piai himself believes in it: one will put
himself in the hands of another when sick" (Go, 13). Schomburgk was
"convinced that the piai believes in the efficacy of his witchcraft as
firmly as his protéges" (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 146). The
real causes of the existing prejudice against the medicine-men are not
far to seek, and have often been clearly expressed. "As doctors, angurs,
rain-makers, spell-binders, leaders of secret societies, and
depositaries of the tribal traditions and wisdom, their influence was
generally powerful. Of course it was adverse to the Europeans,
especially the missionaries, and also of course it was generally
directed to their own interest or that of their class; but this is
equally true of priestly power wherever it gains the ascendency, and the
injurious effect of the Indian shamans on their nations was not greater
than has been in many instances that of the Christian priesthood on
European communities" <span id="page_328">p. 328</span> (Bri, 55). On
the other hand, there is not a single recorded instance of the Guianese
Indian priesthood ever having submitted those of their people holding
religious views different from their own to either torture or the block.
The Creole term for the priest-doctor is *piai*-man, a hybrid that seems
to have been first recorded by Waterton in the form of *pee-ay*-man, who
is an enchanter; he finds out things lost (W, 223). In its simple form,
the word of course came into use much earlier, and is seemingly derived
from the Carib *piache*, which Gumilla employs, and is still met with
among the Pomeroon group of these Indians as *piésan*. Brett (Br, 363)
derives it from the Carib word *puiai*, which denotes their profession.
The Akawais call it *piatsan*. Dance seems to derive the name from that
of the tribal hero, Pia ([Sect. *41*](aflg02.htm#pp_41)). Crévaux in
Cayenne speaks of *piay*, de Goeje in Surinam of *piai*, and Bates,
throughout the extent of the Amazons visited by him, of *pajé*. The
Warrau word for the priest-doctor is *wishidatu* (*wisidaā*, according
to Brett), similarly applied to the kickshaws. In some of the Orinoco
nations, they call these men *Mojàn*: in others *Piache*: in others
*Alabuqŭi*, etc. (G, <span class="small">II</span>, 25) The Piapocos
Indians of the lower Guaviar River speak of them a *Kamarikeri* (Cr,
526); the Caribs of the lower Caroni River as *Marirri* (AVH, <span
class="small">III</span>, 89), and the Island Caribs as *Bové* (RoP,
473). The Arawak designation is of equal interest and also of extended
range: it is *Semi-tchichi* or *Semi-cihi*, the same term applied
generally to the kickshaws and various apparatus employed in the pursuit
of the craft ([Sect. *93*](aflg07.htm#pp_93)).

   <span id="pp_286"></span>**286.**[\*](#pp_286) Both alive and dead,
the medicine-men had the respect and fear of the community. They were
the teachers, preachers, counsellors, and guides, of the Indians;
"regarded as the arbiters of life and death, everything was permitted,
and nothing refused them; the people would suffer anything at their
hands without being able to obtain redress, and with never a thought of
complaining" (PBa, 210). They thus lived "in clover," (G, <span
class="small">II</span>, 24), better than all the rest of the people
(St, <span class="small">I</span>, 399). And yet in a sense they were
restricted: they must not partake of the flesh of the larger animals,
but limit themselves to those only which are indigenous to their country
(ScR, <span class="small">I</span>, 173); they had religiously to
abstain from certain fish and game (PBa, 211); no animal food was
publicly tasted by these priests, while they abstained, even more
strictly than the laity from the flesh of oxen, sheep, and all other
animals that had been transported from Europe ([Sect.
*247*](aflg15.htm#pp_247)) and were "unnatural" to their country (St,
<span class="small">I</span>, 399). They were said to renew their piai
power from time to time by drinking tobacco juice, but in doses not so
strong as at the time of installation (PBa, 211). As stated above, even
dead the medicine-men were still respected.

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

> veneration as if they were the Reliques of Saints. When they have put
> their bones together, they hang them in the Air in the same cotton
> beds those Wizards use to live in when alive. \[Da, 98.\]

   Bates gives a curious example of such veneration and sanctity, met
with at a spot on the Jaburu channel, Marajo Island, at the mouth of the
Amazon, "which is the object of a strange superstitious observance on
the part of the canoe-men. It is said to be haunted by a Pajé, or Indian
wizard, whom it is necessary to propitiate, by depositing some article
on the spot, if the voyager wishes to secure a safe return from the
*sertaô*, as the interior of the country is called. The trees were all
hung with rags, shirts, straw hats, bunches of fruits, and so forth.
Although the superstition doubtless originated with the aborigines, yet
I observed, in both my voyages, that it was only the Portuguese and
uneducated Brazilians who deposited anything. The pure Indians gave
nothing; but they were all civilized Tapuyos" (HWB, 115). Koch-Grünberg
gives a similar example on the River Caiary-Uaupes (Upper Rio Negro),
where the practice is undoubtedly observed by the Indians (KG, <span
class="small">I</span>, 237), while Coudreau (<span
class="small">II</span>, 404) has observed it on the Rio Branco.
(Compare the protective charm against the Curupira, etc., in [Sect.
*109*](aflg08.htm#pp_109).).

   <span id="pp_287"></span>**287.**[\*](#pp_287) It sometimes happened
that the captain and the piai were one and the same person, as in
Cayenne (PBa, 208). But on the other hand, however great his abilities,
the medicine-man did not obtain any distinctive position, as head of the
farnily, through his proficiency (Go, 14). Bancroft (310) says that in
almost every family, there is a person consecrated to the craft. There
was apparently nothing characteristic about the piai in the way of
ornament or decoration. I can find no confirmation of Bernau's statement
that the novitiate's "right ear is pierced, and he is required to wear a
ring all his lifetime" (Be, 31).

   <span id="pp_288"></span>**288.**[\*](#pp_288) The insignia and
"stock-in-trade" of the medicine-man, in his highest stage of
development, comprise a particular kind of bench, a rattle, a doll or
manikin, certain crystals, and other kickshaws, generally something out
of the common, all except the first mentioned being packed away when not
in use, in a basket, or pegall, which is usually of a shape different
from that employed by the lay fraternity. The peculiarity of the basket
among Arawaks and Warraus lies in both top and bottom being concave. St.
Clair (<span class="small">I</span>, 330) reports that on the Corentyn,
among Arawaks, he came across the "magical shell" (rattle) supported by
three pieces of stick, the ends of which were stuck into the ground, in
the middle of the floor; it is not clear, however, whether in this
situation the implement was being used or not. At any rate, all the
insignia were taboo to the common folk and were kept out of harm's way
in a special shed, the piai's consulting-room, <span id="page_330">p.
330</span> so to speak. Were they to be profaned, they would lose their
intrinsic virtues, while the delinquents would suffer misfortunes of
various descriptions. The bench (the *ha-la* of the Arawaks), <span
id="pl5"></span>[plate 5](pl5), differed from the ordinary article of
furniture usually met with in Indian houses, in being larger, often
painted, and carved in fanciful designs of various animals, but little
is known concerning the why and wherefore of the selection of the
particular beast; thus, I have seen the turtle, alligator, tiger, and
macaw more or less faithfully represented on such Warrau and Arawak
divining-stools.

   <span id="pp_289"></span>**289.**[\*](#pp_289) The rattle, *maráka*
(an Arawak word), the *shakshak* of the Creoles, differs somewhat in
shape, size, and ornamentation throughout the various tribes. It
consists essentiany of a large cleaned-out "calabash," containing stones
and other objects, through which a closely fitting tapering stick is run
from end to end by means of two apertures cut for the purpose ([fig.
4](#p330)). This gourd shell (*Crescentia cujete* Linn.), which may or
may not be painted in various colors, is provided with certain small
circular holes as well as with a few long narrow slits, both kinds of
openings being too small to allow of the contents (either
quartz-crystals or a species of agate) dropping out. Seeds may be
employed with or without the stones—small pea-like seeds variegated with
black and yellow spots which, it is commonly believed, will occasion the
teeth to fall out if they are chewed (Ba, 311), or hard red ones (StC,
<span class="small">I</span>, 320). But whether seeds or stones, they
usually have some out-of-the-way origin; the former, for instance, may
have been extracted from the piai teacher's stomach (PBa, 208); the
latter may be the gift of the Water Spirits ([Sect.
*185*](aflg12.htm#pp_185)). According to a Kaliña, the power of the
*maráka* lies in the stone contained therein (Go, 14). The thicker,
projecting part of the stick constitutes the handle, to prevent its
slipping; it may be wrapped with cotton thread. The exposed thinner end
is ornamented with feathers, as those of the parrot, inserted in a
cotton band, which is then wound spirally on it. An Arawak medicine-man
assured me that the feathers must not only be those of a special kind of
parrot (*Psittacus œstivus*), but that they must be plucked from the
<span id="page_331">p. 331</span> bird while alive. A string of beetles'
wings may be superadded. Gumilla (<span class="small">I</span>, 155)
states his belief that the Aruacas \[Arawaks\], the cleverest of the
Indians, were the inventors of the *maráka*, which even in his day, some
two centuries ago, had "also been introduced into other nations." From
the fact that, according to Indian tradition ([Sect.
*185*](aflg12.htm#pp_185)), the original rattle was a gift from the
Spirits, Dance (290) accounts for the great veneration in which it is
held even by Christian converts who have ceased to use it. Brett (Br,
364) confirms this, saying that there are Indians who fear to touch it
or even to approach the place where it is kept. I have had personal
experience that the same holds true today in the Pomeroon. So again, on
account of the agates being put to use in the construction of the
apparatus, Bancroft (21) records how these white and red stones remain
untouched where they are found in abundance above the cataracts of the
Demerara. In speaking of the Warrau rattle, Schomburgk says: "If the
sick man dies, the piai buries his rattle also, since it has lost its
power now, and with the sick person its healing properties die" (ScR,
<span class="small">I</span>, 172). I can not, however, find this
statement anywhere confirmed.

   <span id="pp_290"></span>**290.**[\*](#pp_290) Gumilla (*I*, 155)
says that the medico makes the Indians believe that the maráka speaks
with the Spirit (*demonio*), and that by its means he knows whether the
sick person will live or not. This statement does not exactly agree with
the evidence handed down to us by other reliable authors, nor does it
quite agree with what I have been taught and have seen put into
practice. The object of the rattle is to invoke the Spirits only; it is
rather the business of the manikin, or doll, to give the prognosis, to
lend assistance, etc. Mention is made of such an object in *Timehri*
(June, 1892, p. 183): "Some few months ago, a gold expert and prospector
while traveling along the Barima River, came upon the burial-place of an
Indian Peaiman or Medicine-man. The house under wliich the burial had
been made was hung round with five of the typical peaiman's rattle or
shak-shak, and over the grave itself was placed the box of the dead man,
containing the various objects which had been the instruments, or
credentials, of his calling. The contents of this box . . . were a
carved wooden doll or baby." The doll, or manikin ([fig. 5](#p332)),
which I saw used for the purpose on the Moruca River, was a little black
one about 2½ inches long, balanced "gingerly" on its feet, which bore
traces of having been touched with some gummy substance: if during the
course of the special incantation it remained in the erect position, the
patient would recover, but if it fell over, this would be a sure sign of
his approaching death. In parts of Cayenne the doll is replaced by the
Anaan-tanha, or Devil-figure ([Sect. *311*](aflg17.htm#pp_311)), which
is unmercifully thrashed with a view to compelling the Evil Spirit to
<span id="page_332">p. 332</span> leave the invalid. The identity of
this mainland doll, or manikin, with the idol, or *cemi*, of the
Antilleans has already been indicated ([Sect. *93*](aflg07.htm#pp_93)).

   <span id="pp_291"></span>**291.**[\*](#pp_291) The crystals are
employed for charming, bewitching, or cursing others, though the
references in the literature to their application in this manner are
exceedingly scarce. Indeed, I can call to mind only the following from
Crévaux (554): "I notice on the neck of one of them \[Guahibos of the
Orinoco\] a bit of crystal set in the cavity of an alligator's tooth.
The whole has the name of guanare. . . . It is with this guanare that
the Guahibos throw spells (*jettent des sortilèges*) on their hated
neighbors, the Piaroas. . . . Every mineral that presents in its lines
and shape a certain regularity is to

them the work of a devil or a sorcerer." Cursing and similar procedure
are not, however, the sole prerogative of the medicine-man, at least not
in the Pomeroon District of the present day; the procedure is known as
*hó-a* to both Warraus and Arawaks, and is practised, I am told, by very
old people. As a remedy for over-fatigue, Schomburgk describes "Macusis
and Wapisianas cutting each other's legs with a piece of rock crystal,
an instrument to which they ascribed particular virtue, refusing instead
of it my offer of a lancet" (ScF, 235).

   <span id="pp_292"></span>**292.**[\*](#pp_292) With respect to
remaining kickshaws, Pinckard (<span class="small">I</span>, p. 505)
says: "And having faith in spells, they make little decorated
instruments, of tender rushes about a foot long, which their physicians
or priests called *Pyeis* employ together with other magical implements,
as wands to drive out these demons of Ill." These instruments I have
been unable to identify thus far. Finally, on the authority of the old
medicine-man who taught me the greater part of what I know concerning
the practice of the art, a "charm" of some description was worn on the
chest suspended by a cord hung round the neck ([Sect.
*93*](aflg07.htm#pp_93)). The one that my late teacher (Bariki) employed
is flat and oval, made of some resinous material, and ornamented on one
side with the incised figure of a female frog ([fig. 6](#p333)). It had
been given Bariki by his grandfather when the latter taught him his
profession, and when the old man died, he left it to me. In the extract
from *Timehri* (1892, p. 184) above quoted, where is to be found a list
of the kickshaws appertaining to the piai-man's stock-in-trade, is
mentioned: "a neatly carved representation, in reddish quartz, of a dog
sitting on its haunches <span id="page_333">p. 333</span> and holding
its front well up. In this figure the base of the fore legs is occupied
by two clearly-bored holes, into which, evidently, it had been the
custom to fit strings by which to pull the little object along on the
ground, just as toys are usually drawn along by small children." It
seems to me far more reasonable, under the circumstances, to suppose
that this object was the doctor's chest-ornament just referred to. There
is absolutely no evidence of any Guiana Indian toy being used in this
manner, and it is ridiculous to believe that the vast amount of labor
necessarily involved in carving

quartz and boring holes through it, would be expended on a child's
play-thing.

   <span id="pp_293"></span>**293.**[\*](#pp_293) The office of the
medicine-man appears to have been hereditary and to have passed to the
eldest son (Ba, 316). If he has no son the piai picks a friend as his
successor (ScR, <span class="small">I</span>, 172), although the same
authority (Schomburgk) elsewhere states that, under these circumstances,
he chooses the craftiest among the boys (ScR, <span
class="small">I</span>, 423-4). It is likely that the secrets and
mysteries of the profession may also have been imparted to outsiders for
a consideration. I happen to have known one of the fraternity who taught
another his profession for the sum down of eleven dollars together with
the gift of his daughter. Im Thurn (334) says: "If there was no son to
succeed the father, the latter chose and trained some boy from the
tribe—one with an epileptic tendency being preferred. . . . It has been
said that epileptic subjects are by preference chosen as piaimen, and
are trained to throw themselves at will into convulsions." Perhaps this
idea had its origin in the fact that through the use of a narcotic
powder, the piais can throw themselves into a condition of wild ecstasy
(ScR, <span class="small">I</span>, 423-4): several such powders were
known to some of the Guiana Indians, as the *Yupa* (G, <span
class="small">I</span>, 181), etc. On the other hand I can find no
references in the literature to the choice of epileptic subjects;
furthermore, the unlikelihood is turned into impossibility, when it is
borne in mind that the victim of such a convulsion would be unconscious
during its progress.

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

   <span id="pp_294"></span>**294.**[\*](#pp_294) Occasionally the piai
may be a woman. Thus, I knew an old Warrau dame who used to practise her
profession in the neighborhood of Santa Rosa Mission, Moruca River,
under almost the very nose of the unsuspecting Father. On the authority
of Joseph Stoll, Arawak, catechist at St. Bede's Mission, Barama River,
young women, certainly among his own tribe, used to be trained in the
same manner as the boys for the profession of piai: his own grandmother
(on the father's side), and his father's cousin were both trained
piai-women. On the other hand, I can find no references whatever to
woman "doctors" throughout the early literature of the subject.

   <span id="pp_295"></span>**295.**[\*](#pp_295) The medicine-man
usually possesses a little outhouse (Pomeroon and Moruca Rivers), <span
id="pl6"></span>[plate 6](pl6), in which he keeps his various insignia:
the Warraus call it *hebu-hanoku* (Spirit-house). This building is of
course taboo, as indicated by a bundle of kokerite leaves hung over the
entrance. As a matter of fact, I have never seen the doctor's
"consulting-room" in the Pomeroom District built of any leaves other
than kokerite. At Savonette, Berbice, the "consulting-room," so to
speak, must have been a somewhat more complicated structure, for the use
of medicine-men in common. "Near to the cabins that were inhabited, we
observed a detached building inclosed on all sides, forming a single
room, into which light and air were only admitted at the doorway. Upon
inquiry we learned that this was devoted to the use of the sick—not as a
hospital, but as a temple of incantation, for the purpose of expelling
disease" (Pnk, <span class="small">I</span>, 505). On the Amazons,
Father Acuña (98) also leads us to believe that there was in each
settlement one special building for the use of all these doctors: "There
is a certain house devoted to the use of these sorcerers, in which they
perform their superstitious exercises, and converse with the Devil."

   <span id="pp_296"></span>**296.**[\*](#pp_296) The original piai
forms the subject-matter of legends with which Arawaks, Warraus, and
Caribs are all more or less conversant; members of all these tribes
assure me that tobacco was brought here from the islands, but I will let
a Warrau give two of the versions:

   <span id="pp_297"></span>**297.**[\*](#pp_297) The apprenticeship of
the medicine-man in the olden days was very far from being the
proverbial bed of roses. Among other tests, he had for many months to
practise self-denial, and submit under a stinted diet to the prohibition
of what were to him accustomed luxuries. He had to satisfy his teacher
in his knowledge of the instincts and habits of animals, in the
properties of plants, and the seasons for flowering and bearing, for the
piai man was often consulted as to when and where game was to be found,
and he was more than often correct in his surmises. He also had to know
of the grouping of the stars into constellations, and the legends
connected not only with them, but with his own tribe. He had likewise to
be conversant with the media for the invocation of the Spirits, as
chants and recitatives, and also to be able to imitate animal and human
voices. He had to submit to a chance of death by drinking a decoction of
tobacco in repeated and increasing doses, and to have his eyes washed
with the infusion of hiari leaves ([Sect. *169*](aflg10.htm#pp_169)); he
slowly recovered, with a confused mind, believing that in his trance,
the effect of narcotics and a distempered mind, he was admitted into the
company of the Spirits, that he conversed with them, and was by
themselves consecrated to the office of piai priest-doctor (Da, 285).
Bancroft (316) says that the novitiate "is dosed with the juice of
tobacco till it no longer operates as an emetic." Sometimes, as among
the Oyambis on the Oyapock River in French Guiana, other things were
mixed with the tobacco, for example, a plant called <span
id="page_339">p. 339</span> quinquiva, as well as certain of the
drippings from an exposed dead body (Cr, 158). For the same colony
Fathers Grillet and Bechamel (GB, 48) record that the medicine-men
proffer neither physic nor divination "till they have made divers
experiments, one of which is so dangerous that it often makes them
burst. They stamp the green leaves of tobacco and squeeze out the juice
of it, of which they drink the quantity of a large glassful, etc.; so
that none but those who are of a very robust constitution, who try this
practice upon themselves, escape with their lives." Brett (Br, 362) also
testifies to the severity of the ordeal, for after the novice has been
reduced to the deathlike state of sickness to which the fasting coupled
with the drinking of tobacco-water has brought him—

>    His death is loudly proclaimed, and his countrymen called to
> witness his state. Recovery is slow, and about the tenth day he comes
> forth from the sacred hut in a most emaciated condition. For ten
> months after the new sorcerer must abstain from the flesh of birds and
> beasts, and only the smallest kinds of fish are allowed him. Even
> cassava bread is to be eaten sparingly, and intoxicating drinks
> avoided during that period. Meats and food not indigenous to the
> country are especially tabooed. . . . McClintock states that the
> "above rules are common to the Caribs as well as the Waraus, but that
> the former are allowed during their period of abstinence to take a
> little meat—the flesh of the Acouri. . . . The Akawoios differ in some
> respects from the other tribes, inasmuch as not less than four, and
> frequently more, become M. D.'s at the same time."

   Gumilla (<span class="small">II</span>, 25), on the Orinoco speaks of
the apprenticeship of the *Piache* in the following terms:

>    In the forest of Casiabo, there was a medicine-man named Tulujay,
> so celebrated that Indians flocked to him from all quarters, but they
> did not all come to learn, nor subject themselves to his teaching,
> because this cost them very dear. For besides adequate payment, he
> imposes such a rigorous 40-day fast on them, that few dare to
> undertake it: of those that do, the majority leave the Master weakened
> with the fasting: he who completes it is made to swallow, without
> chewing, three pills, manufactured of different herbs, of the size of
> a cherry-stone. These pills are said to be an antidote for every kind
> of poison, and so render the disciple secure from all his rivals and
> enemies. The credulity of the Indians is so simple that none of them
> will meddle with any individuals so treated (*curados*).

   Most of the above accounts are concerned mainly with the drinking of
the tobacco, an ordeal to which the old-time missionaries and travelers
seem chiefly to have devoted their attention. Though it would have been
of course more or less practised beforehand, the tobacco ordeal in its
entirety was reserved for the grand day when the public installation
took place. During his course of training, in addition to his other
instruction, the apprentice was taught to suffer the pangs of hunger and
thirst, and to experience the martyrdom of pain without complaint or
murmur. To teach him the latter, he was either bitten with ants or cut
on various portions of the body. Among the Islanders "his body is
scraped with acouri teeth" (BBR, 236). The ants were fixed into the
interstices of plaited diamond-shaped <span id="page_340">p. 340</span>
mats or girdles and these were held or tied on the neck, breast,
stomach, or legs (WJ, 91). In some cases, during their period of
probationership, the prospective medicine-men must not come into contact
with Europeans, as this would destroy forever their influence over the
spirit world (ScR, <span class="small">I</span>, 423). West of the
Orinoco, "they submitted to a seclusion of two years in caverns,
situated in the deepest recesses of the forests. During this period they
ate no animal food; they saw no person, not even their parents. The old
Piaches or doctors went and instructed them during the night" (FD, 50).
Magic stones are alleged to be placed in the novitiate's head (KG, <span
class="small">II</span>, 154). Crévaux, among the Roucouyennes of the
Yary River, French Guiana, speaks of the "many years of probationership"
(Cr, 117). "Takes some years: the novice returns more like a skeleton
than a man among his people" (ScR, <span class="small">I</span>, 423-4).
The only account of a *public* installation of the would-be piai,
actually described as such, comes from Cayenne:

>    At the public installation to which the neighboring piais are
> invited, the aspirant has to swallow at one draught a calabash
> containing about two pints of tobacco-juice. Most often he falls into
> a swoon, whereupon he is carried to his hammock: if he does not vomit
> directly after taking this powerful emetic, he dies, or at least he is
> seized with horrible convulsions and breaks out into cold sweats,
> etc., which all tend to bring him to the grave. But if he survives, he
> is acclaimed Piai. \[PBa, 211.\]

   In the Island practices, the novitiate is made to drink tobacco-juice
until he faints, and, when they say that his Spirit has gone to the
Chemeen, they rub his body with gum, and cover it with feathers to allow
him to fly to the Chemeen (BBR, 235). Among the Pomeroon District
Arawaks and Warraus it would seem that the aspirant wore a special
cotton headdress at the time of installation. Pitou mentions the piai
installation as taking place on the night before the marriages (LAP,
<span class="small">II</span>, 266).

   <span id="pp_298"></span>**298.**[\*](#pp_298) Mention has already
been made ([Sect. *297*](aflg17.htm#pp_297)) of the knowledge, of which
the medicine-man had to give proof, concerning the instincts, habits,
etc., of animals. Seated on his professional stool, with maraka in hand,
he might be observed studying where game is to be found by the morrow's
daybreak. He lights up his fire, and igniting some tobacco, he invites
by invocation the spirits of the game he desires ([Sect.
*116*](aflg08.htm#pp_116)). In his enthusiasm he speaks to them and
answers for them in their supposed peculiar tones, modulated as in
ventriloquy; for he believes that, being possessed, they answer through
him, he being at the same time the humble earnest inquirer and the
sufficient aswerer of his own inquiries (Da, 287). This belief in the
interdependence of the priesthood and animal life is well illustrated in
an example (Ti, <span class="small">II</span>, 1883, p. 348) given by
McClintock: "I had an Accawoi huntsman who was a sorcerer (peaiman) and
considered that he had certain birds and animals so completely under his
control that <span id="page_341">p. 341</span> no inducement would have
tempted him to kill any of them; among them were powis . . . maroodies,
and the Arua tiger. . . . The latter he always told he could put his
hand upon any time he went out."

   Another apt illustration is furnished by Schomburgk: "In our
peregrinations in the savannahs we frequently met with the nests, of
wild bees. They belonged to a species which the Makusi Indians called
wampang; the Wapisiana camuiba. The hives or nests are generally fixed
to branches of trees, and are from 2 to 3 feet in length. . . . It
stings severely; and in order to secure nests, the Indians kindle fires
under them, when the insects abandon their fabrics *en masse*. I have,
however, seen an Indian who was the conjurer or piaiman of his tribe,
merely approach the nest, and knocking with his fingers against it,
drive out all the bees without a single one injuring him. I noticed him
drawing his fingers under the pits of his arms before he knocked against
the hive" (ScT, 40). The piai system made a secret art of hunting; from
the priest-doctor the hunters learned to hunt for the particular game
they required, and received at his hands charms—*maklar* and *bina*—to
insure their success (Da, 251). Among the Indians of the Uaupes River,
the piais are believed to have power to destroy dogs or game and to make
the fish leave a river (ARW, 347). The medicine-man furthermore could
transform himself into an animal ([Sect. *154*](aflg09.htm#pp_154)); if
his wife becomes pregnant she may bear him a tiger, an animal into which
he himself may be transformed at death (KG, <span
class="small">II</span>, 154).

   <span id="pp_299"></span>**299.**[\*](#pp_299) Certainly among many
of the tribes the "doctors" were believed to be endowed with such power
over their own spirits as to render themselves invisible. At a Makusi
village on the Karakarang River, a branch of the Cotinga, Barrington
Brown (Bro, 119) was told that many of their people had gone to Roraima
to see an Indian sorcerer there who had the power of making himself
invisible at will. At Mora village, on the upper Rupununi, the same
traveler (Bro, 139) explains how the piai's absence for the night was
unavoidable, owing to his having to go up among the mountains to roam
about for the night, while his good spirit remained in one of the houses
to cure a sick man.

   Not only could the medicine-man invoke Spirits generally, as well as
those of particular birds and beasts, but he could also play tricks with
his own and other Indians' Spirits. Thus, im Thurn (339): "He is able to
call to him and question the spirit of any sleeping Indian of his own
tribe, so that if an Indian wishes to know what an absent friend is
doing, he has only to employ the piai-man to summon and question the
spirit of the far-away Indian. Or the piai-man may send his own spirit,
his body remaining present, to get the required information."

   <span id="pp_300"></span>**300.**[\*](#pp_300) The piai's reputation
as an interpreter of dreams was second to none: he was both dreamer and
seer ([Sect. *298*](aflg17.htm#pp_298)), but this is only what <span
id="page_342">p. 342</span> might have been expected, considering the
powers he possessed over other people's Spirits ([Sect.
*299*](aflg17.htm#pp_299)), and dreams are really but people's Spirits
([Sect. *86*](aflg06.htm#pp_86)).

   <span id="pp_301"></span>**301.**[\*](#pp_301) Among other duties
that the medicine-men might be called on to perform was to fix the time
most propitious for the people to attack their enemies (HWB, 244). They
were supposed to be gifted with the power of prophecy: they foretold the
issue of battles (BBR, 234), whether there would be war or peace;
similarly, they could prophesy as to the crops—whether these would prove
scanty or abundant (FD, 51).

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

   <span id="pp_302"></span>**302.**[\*](#pp_302) The Pomeroon Arawaks
appear to credit the piai with being able to influence the Yawahus in
bringing the as-yet-unborn babes to the mothers ([Sect.
*284A*](aflg16.htm#pp_284A)). In some districts, as on the Berbice, the
piais were said to be professional poisoners, but it must be remembered
that the charge of poisoning was one made against an Arawaks as a habit
(Da, 16). Among the wurali-poison-making tribes, for example, the
Makusis, Bernau's statement (Be, 36) that the "conjurers alone are
conversant with the art of compounding it" does not seem to be borne out
by the facts. At one place on the Orinoco, as already stated ([Sect.
*297*](aflg17.htm#pp_297)), the sorcerers were alleged to be rendered
poison-proof (G, <span class="small">II</span>, 25). Waterton's
statement (W, 223) that "he is an enchanter: he finds out things lost"
is only a further example of the piai's supposed versatility. I remember
on one occasion unconsciously giving great offence to my old
doctor-friend, Bariki, now alas! gone to his long, last rest, by asking
him *if* he knew so-and-so: he gave me a withering glance, and after a
few moments, silence, said, "I know all things." Taking the hint, I
subsequently invariably sought information from him by putting my
question in the form of "Tell me this, or that," with the result that,
pleased with my appreciation of his mental superiority, he was always
ready to impart all he knew, and perhaps more.

   <span id="pp_303"></span>**303.**[\*](#pp_303) The following legend
is another good example showing that there was very little that the
medicine-man could not do in the natural or supernatural sphere: it is
apparently a variant of the stories given in [Sects.
*137*](aflg09.htm#pp_137) and [*142*](aflg09.htm#pp_142).

   <span id="pp_304"></span>**304.**[\*](#pp_304) In some cases the
piais were recognized to a greater or less extent as the guardians of
the tribal traditions. Thus in the "Archivos de Indias; Patronato.
Rodrigo de Navarrete: An account of the Provinces and Nations of the
Aruacas" \[Arawaks\], written some time during the last quarter of the
sixteenth century, a work quoted by Rodway, in *Timehri* (for 1895, p.
10), there is the following interesting reference:

>    These Indians have a meeting-place or school where they assemble,
> as in a manner for preaching. There are among them old and wise men
> whom they call *Cemetu* \[compare the usual form Cemi, Semi, etc.,

> narrate what those ancestors heard from their forefathers; so that in

> relating to the heavens, the sun, moon, and stars.

   <span id="pp_305"></span>**305.**[\*](#pp_305) The medicine-men not
only gave names to the children, as with the Arawaks ([Sect.
*264*](aflg15.htm#pp_264)), but under certain circumstances would change
them. Thus, among this same nation, if a piai is called on to treat a
sick child, and is successful in effecting a cure, he may give his
little patient a new name, and thus enable it to make a fresh start in
life.

   <span id="pp_306"></span>**306.**[\*](#pp_306) The chief business,
however, of these doctors is centered in counteracting the evil designs
of certain Spirits, Kanaima or other, <span id="page_346">p. 346</span>
who cause disease of such a nature as to baffle the ordinary home
treatment and household remedies of the average Indian, though I know of
one instance in which a woman in labor was brought by her husband to
seek remedial measures from one of this fraternity. The home treatment
just referred to might consist in the use of ordinary herbs, vapor
baths, and in other measures known to the average Indian. But
occasionally, as with the Dakinis, to obtain such an herbal remedy, the
piai's assistance may have to be invoked ([Sect.
*168B*](aflg10.htm#pp_168B)). As a matter of fact, all disease which
does not respond readily to treatment is ascribed to various Spirits
acting directly or indirectly, by means of thorns, pointed bones, etc.,
maliciously inserted into the body of the patient. When once invoked,
the medicine-man is able to learn the cause of the trouble, and how to
combat its effects.

   <span id="pp_307"></span>**307.**[\*](#pp_307) Disease or death is
not a "natural" phenomenon, so to speak, but is usually due to one of
two agencies. It may be the work of some Spirit, perpetrated either
judicially or of mere malice, as some affirm, or through the importunity
of a votary. An evil Spirit, one who causes an evil, might send an
animal to bite or sting a person, or cause a tree to fall upon him, his
ax to cut him, water to drown him, or some other calamity (Da, 289).
Now, except through the agency of the piai, the influence of this Spirit
causing the evil can not usually be counteracted. Berman alone for the
Mainland makes the statement, which I must regard as confirmed by the
practice of a similar custom on the Islands, that "when sickness assails
them, they \[laymen, [Sect. *89*](aflg07.htm#pp_89)\] present a
propitiation to the Evil Spirit, consisting of a piece of the flesh of
any quadruped. If recovery follows, they suppose the Evil Spirit to have
regarded and accepted the offering," but if no recovery, the conjurer is
called in, etc. (Be, 51-54). The piais are undoubtedly believed to have
the power of influencing the Spirits not only in removing the causes of
the disease which they (the Spirits) have inflicted, but also in sending
sickness elsewhere ([Sect. *319*](aflg17.htm#pp_319)) In the spring of
1907 the Ojanas (Cayenne) suffered from an epidemic of bronchitis, or
"galloping consumption," from which many died; this was ascribed to the
piais (Go, 14). It is possible, however, that the medicine-men,
independently of Spirits, and certain old people, can inflict sickness
on folks at a distance; for instance, the Apaläi Indians of the upper
Parou, Cayenne, when they can not subdue their sicknesses revenge
themselves by sending an evil charm to a woman ([Sect.
*319*](aflg17.htm#pp_319)) of the neighboring tribe (Cr, 299). It is not
at an uncommon for one tribe to put the blame of some real or imagined
ill on the shoulders of another. For example, the Wapisianas consider
the Makusis the most dangerous poisoners and Kanaimas—every illness is
ascribed by them to the wickedness of the Makusis (ScR, <span
class="small">II</span>, 387). Similarly, on the Tiquie River (Rio
Negro) the Makus <span id="page_347">p. 347</span> are blamed for
everything (KG, <span class="small">I</span>, 270). There is a certain
skin disease, believed to be a *vitiligo*, which the Piapocos of the
lower Guaviar (Orinoco River) call *sero*: it is always contracted by
drinking the *yocuto* (*couac* mixed with water) of an enemy affected
with this trouble, who has mixed in the brew a few drops of his blood
(Cr, 527). Death and other evils may be due also to some human enemy
more or less disguised, modified, or influenced by a peculiarly terrible
Spirit known as Kanaima, against whose machinations the power of the
piai avails nothing. To this belief in Kanaima I propose devoting a
separate chapter ([Sect. *320*](aflg18.htm#pp_320)).

   <span id="pp_308"></span>**308.**[\*](#pp_308) In the Pomeroon
District, the present-day Arawak procedure of the piai, for the
treatment of disease, is as follows: Suppose the patient visits the
"doctor," the latter will sling the sufferer's hammock in the special
out-house already mentioned. In those cases in which the person is too
ill to bear removal, the doctor will visit him, and there erect a
closely plaited conical-shaped cage of manicole leaves, with a low door
only just large enough to crawl in and out by. Nothing further can be
done now until the sun sets, but as soon after sundown as convenient the
medicine-man will start a new fire, by twirling one stick upon another.
The fire once kindled, he rolls tobacco to make the usual Indian
cigarette, and proceeds to examine the patient. He then asks what the
pain is like, and where it is—as, in stomach, head, chest,—and talks to
his kickshaws, especially the manikin, or doll, to learn whether the
patient is going to be cured. The method of employment of this doll has
already been given ([Sect. *290*](aflg17.htm#pp_290)). Seated on his
special chair, the doctor next lights and smokes his cigarette, and
finally rubs his hands with haiawa wax. This done, he proceeds to
massage the painful spot, and smokes on it through his hands placed
funnel-wise. This part of the treatment may be viewed by the public,
there being nothing secret or mysterious about it, and may of itself
effect a cure, in which case, as the Creoles would say, "Story done."
With the next procedure, however, provided the illness prove stubborn,
the females are all sent away from the place, men have to keep at a
respectful distance, quiet must reign, and all lights have to be
extinguished. The alleged reason for putting out the fires is that the
various Spirits whom he is now about to invoke may not be afraid to
come. (If the treatment is being carried out at the patient's residence,
the medicine-man will crawl into the cage when the invocation takes
place.) In the meantime, the medicine-man cleans and polishes his
maraka, which he pieces together, and ties the feathers carefully on,
smoking on it all the while: he sings and shakes his rattle. Leaving his
bench, he touches the painful spot or spots with the maraka, circling it
in the air, smoking and singing all the while, altering his voice from
bass to alto and vice-versa according to the voice of the Spirit which
is presumed <span id="page_348">p. 348</span> to be conversing with him.
Apparently two voices are often heard. When it is remembered that the
Spirit may be anything from a tiger to a powis, even another piai, the
various modulations of voice and speech which he has been trained to
reproduce can be better imagined than described. He does not know
beforehand which one has wrought the mischief; hence he has to invite
and interrogate each one. This manner of invocation, according to the
fee given, may continue until two or three in the morning—there is a
limit to the doctor's powers and endurance—when all the kickshaws will
be put away in the specially constructed pegall. Our medicine-man,
seated on his divining stool, will proceed to smoke and dream, and in
his dream he will discover at whose instigation the sickness has been
sent, and whether the illness itself is due to a dead person's Spirit
(as a Bush Spirit), to a living one's Spirit (a Kanaima), or to the
Oriyu, or Water Spirit. At the same time he also learns the mode of
cure. Next morning he will retail this information either to the patient
or to his friends, as soon as he is paid something over and above the
fee (as cloth, beads, money), which he has already received. The cure
may be such as can then and there be carried out, as the extraction of
the evil by suction, or the disease may prove of so serious a nature
that it is a matter for the Spirits alone to deal with. At any rate the
medicine-man then gives careful directions as to how the patient and his
relatives are to be fed—with bird, fish, or otherwise, as the case may
be—but there is always the stipulation that whatever is ordered (*a*)
must never be added to, or taken away from, for example, no salt,
peppers, seasoning, etc., and no "trimming off;" (*b*) must be cooked
with the doctor's own fire, or with another specially made for the
purpose by means of two pieces of stick, care being taken in both cases
that it is not touched by a stranger; (*c*) must not be allowed to boil
over the edge of the pot. If during the course of the day the patient
should not improve, the doctor will repeat the treatment the same
night—smoking, singing, and dreaming—but on this occasion, addressing
the Spirit which has caused the mischief, he implores it if possible to
restore the health which it has impaired. He may even repeat all this
the third night if the patient's grave condition warrants so doing, and
he is paid an adequate fee. At any rate, when he finally completes the
treatment the doctor invariably tells the patient, unless the latter is
actually moribund, that he will recover, but that both he and his family
must be very careful as to the foods prescribed, for should the sufferer
unfortunately die it is always because one or other of the stipulations
regarding diet has not been properly obeyed. When, during the course of
the treatment, rain happens to fall, the proceedings are immediately
postponed to the following evening.

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

   <span id="pp_309"></span>**309.**[\*](#pp_309) Among the Pomeroon
Caribs I have been present on several occasions on the Manawarin River
at the procedure adopted by a piai to affect a cure. It has always been
at night, with the doctor seated in a small temporary cone-shaped
structure roughly made of manicole leaves, and the rattle brought into
requisition. Operations invariably commenced with the invocation of four
particular Spirits by "singing" to them, each with a different song, by
tobacco smoke, and by shaking the maraka. As a matter of fact the medico
is said to call up only the first Spirit; the latter, however, invokes
the second, and so on. The names of these four Spirits, in the order in
which they are summoned, are Mawari ([Sect. *122*](aflg08.htm#pp_122)),
Makai-abáni, Iakai-a, and Aturaróni. All except the second live
somewhere in the bush, but they come when summoned by the rattle.
Makai-abáni, on the other hand, remains in the maraka, coming out only
when shaken, and then he envelops himself in the tobacco-smoke. All
these four are good Spirits and friends of the piai; they are male and
female, like people, and come from the bodies of old-time medicine-men;
they tell the celebrant whether the disease from which the sick man is
suffering has been sent by another Spirit or by another piai at the
instigation of some enemy. The three evil Spirits who send sickness,
ill-luck, and other calamities to mankind, belong to Cloud-land, and to
Water; Kwamaraka lives in the sky below the clouds and is something like
a "gaulding" bird (*Pilerodius*); Tokoroi-mo has his home below the
clouds, and resembles the "doraquarra" bird (*Odontophorus*); while
Oko-yumo is the "water-mamma" ([Sect. *177*](aflg12.htm#pp_177)). These
three have a master, called No-séno, who lives somewhere above the
clouds; he is a man, a very bad one, is always for killing somebody, and
is his own master. But to return. If the disease has been sent by one or
other of these bad Spirits, the piai gets Mawari to take it far, far
away, away to the Orinoco River; but if by another piai, the present
celebrant will send it back to him, and woe betide the latter if he is
not smart enough to avoid it, for unless he takes very great care he is
sure to die from it. Should, however, the sickness prove stubborn,
"Tiger" is finally called on; directly his voice is heard the disease
comes out to be speedily devoured by him. But if Tiger should prove
unsuccessful, nothing now can possibly save the patient.

   <span id="pp_310"></span>**310.**[\*](#pp_310) The Galibi piai of
French Guiana practised similar methods, according to the accounts left
us by Barrere: After placing the maraka below the patient's hammock, the
piai starts sucking at those parts of the sick person's body where the
pains are greatest, afterward passing both hands over the patient; he
then strikes his hands together and blows on each palm ([Sect.
*85*](aflg05.htm#pp_85)) so as to drive away the "Devil" \[spirit\] that
has attached itself there ([Sect. *74*](aflg05.htm#pp_74)); the piai
will sometimes pinch up pieces of his own skin, and thus extracting
corpulency (embonpoint) and good health, will apply these in handsful to
the patient while making the passes over him. <span id="page_350">p.
350</span> These Indians also employed the little hut specially
constructed in the *karbet*, in which, after all the lights have been
extinguished, the medicine-men "sings" and shakes the rattle. He often
comes out of his little cabin and would pretend that it is the Devil
\[Spirit\] that has got out. He will then run right round the *karbet*
and tug at the hammocks in which the Indians are lying. He sometimes
says that he is going up into the skies, but will soon return, and he
will then mimic the distant voice, etc. (PBa, 213-215).

   <span id="pp_311"></span>**311.**[\*](#pp_311) In remote parts \[of
French Guiana\] and toward the sources of the River Oyapok, the Indians
\[? Oyampis\] practise another method, with the figure of a Devil
\[Spirit\] made of a very soft and resonant wood. This statue, which is
three or four feet high, looks frightful with its long tail (queue) and
big claws with which they provide it. They call it Anaan-tanha
(literally, Devil-figure). After having blown on the sick person, the
piais carry the statue out of the hut. There they talk to it, and thrash
it unmercifully with sticks, so as to force the Devil \[Spirit\], in
spite of itself, to leave the sick person. These exorcisms are carried
out at night, after the fires have been extinguished (PBa, 216). Very
interesting in this connection is the maize-straw manikin, found by
Crévaux, among the Apaläi Indians of Cayenne (Cr, 301), which may have
been employed for a similar purpose; it represented a warrior ready to
let fly an arrow, fixed on two sticks arranged crosswise like a gallows.

   <span id="pp_312"></span>**312.**[\*](#pp_312) It is not always
necessary, however, to use the maraka, it being quite possible to invoke
the Spirits with a couple of bundles of leaves. Thus, Schomburgk gives
the following account of a Makusi performance at Nappi, on the Canuku
Mountains:

>    The old man came into my hut with two bundles of leaves in his
> hands, and with them he drove out the other occupants. He then put out
> all the fires, sat near my hammock on the ground, which he whipped
> with the bundles, and started howling, only now and again broken by
> short pauses. After this had gone on for a quarter of an hour, I
> recognized a second voice by the side of my hammock, and question and
> answer went on between the two. The conversations with the evil
> spirits are unintelligible even to the Indians: it was next morning
> that the piai took care to make them aware of its contents. After the
> double conversation was finished, the magician placed himself at the
> head-end of my hammock, howled close to my forehead and, after
> lighting a cigar, blew strong clouds of tobacco-smoke into my face
> which almost suffocated me, and pressed the bundle of leaves (which I
> recognized by the smell as tobacco leaves) onto my forehead. This went
> on for quite half an hour and got me into a good sweat: at last his
> voice failed him, and he left the hut. He did not use the maraka.
> \[ScR <span class="small">II</span>, 145-146.\]

   <span id="pp_313"></span>**313.**[\*](#pp_313) Westward of the
Guianas a particular kind of wood apparently played the same rôle as the
rattle or the leaf-bundle, if we accept the statement of Depons in his
description of the Captain Generalship of Caracas:

>    The practice of these professors of the healing art consisted in
> licking and sucking the affected part, in order, according to them, to
> eliminate the peccant humour. <span id="page_351">p. 351</span> When
> the fever or pain increased, suction of the joints, as well as
> friction over all the body with the hand, was employed. During the
> performance of this operation, some unintelligible words were
> pronounced, with a loud voice, commanding the evil spirits to depart
> out of the patient's body. If the malady did not readily yield, the
> Piache or physician had recourse to a particular kind of wood, known
> to himself alone, with which he rubbed the breast, throat, and mouth
> of the patient; a practice which seldom failed to produce sickness and
> vomiting. In the meantime the Piache on his side uttered dreadful
> exclamations, howled, shook, and made a thousand contortions with his
> body. If the sick person recovered, everything contained in the house
> was given to the Piache; if he died, the fault was imputed to Destiny,
> never to the physician. \[FD, 50.\]

   <span id="pp_314"></span>**314.**[\*](#pp_314) Among the Island Carib
Indians the piai procedure was of the simplest kind:

>    They say that the *Chemeen* \[[Sect. *90*](aflg07.htm#pp_90) et
> seq.\] always comes on scenting the odor of this incense \[tobacco\]
> and, being interrogated, he answers with a clear voice, but sounding
> as from a distance. The sorcerer then approaches the sick person
> repeatedly, feels, presses, and manipulates the suffering part, always
> blowing on it, and extracts something from it, or rather appears to
> extract, some thorns, or small pieces of cassava, wood, or bones,
> making the sick person believe that this was the sole cause of the
> pain. Very often he sucks the painful part, and immediately goes out
> of the house to vomit what he calls the poison. \[BBR, 234.\]

   The following are further particulars of the Island practices as
reported by Rochefort and Poincy:

>    The Boye . . . consults his Familiar Spirit who tells him that it
> is the \[Familiar\] Spirit of such an one who has done it \[who has
> brought the mischief\] \[RoP, 473\]. . . . Then the devil \[Familiar
> Spirit\] whom he has invoked . . . violently shakes the ridge of the
> roof, or with some other noise immediately appears, and replies
> distinctly to all the questions asked by the Boye \[ibid., 563\]. . .
> . If the devil assures him that the illness is not mortal, both the
> Boye and the accompanying phantom approach the sick person to assure
> him that he will soon be cured: and to encourage him in this hope they
> touch gently the most painiul parts of his body, and having pressed
> them a little pretend to extract from them thorns, broken bones,
> splinters of wood and stones which these wretched doctors say were the
> cause of the ill. They also moisten with their breath the weak spot
> and having repeatedly sucked it, they persuade the patient that by
> this means they have extracted the poison which was in his body and
> kept it in languor. They finally rub the sick person's body with
> junipa fruit. . . . But if the Boye has learnt from the communication
> which he has had with his demon that the sickness is a fatal one, he
> contents himself with consoling the sick person by the statement that
> this God, or rather to say, his Familiar Devil, having pity on him,
> wishes to take him into his company, so as to be freed from all his
> infirmities. \[RoP, 564.\]

   <span id="pp_315"></span>**315.**[\*](#pp_315) With regard to the
nature of the Spirits specially invoked, Barrington Brown (Bro, 140)
when describing the performances of a Makusi piai at Mora Village, upper
Rupununi, remarks that—

>    In some instances the good spirit for the time being brought with
> it the evil one that was supposed to have had some hand in producing
> the man's malady; and then the wife asked it how it could come and
> injure a being who had never harmed it, begging it to desist and leave
> her husband alone. The only answer she obtained to this appeal was a
> most diabolical, mocking laugh. The Makunaima, or great spirit, <span
> id="page_352">p. 352</span> was never called upon by the sorcerer to
> assist or cure the sick man, but only the subordinate inhabitants of
> spirit-land.<span id="page_352_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_352_note_1)

   <span id="pp_316"></span>**316.**[\*](#pp_316) As to the
extraordinary variety of visible objects inserted into the body of the
victim by the invisible Spirit and similar agencies, and subsequently
extracted by massage and suction, the following will give some idea:
Fangs of the much-dreaded *Lachesis mutus*, "bushmaster" snake
(McClintock, Ti., June, 1886, p. 94), grass-roots (G, <span
class="small">II</span>, 27), gravel-stone, fish-bone, bird's claw,
snake's tooth, or piece of wire (Br, 364-5), a worm (HWB, 244), a
miniature bow and arrow (Cr, 526). The last-mentioned is very
interesting in view of the Arawak Indians' belief (Br, 361) that all
pain is due to the Evil Spirit's arrow ([Sect.
*330*](aflg18.htm#pp_330)). The medicos of the Otomac nation suck with
such force as to extract blood from the patient, and when this is spat
out on a cleared space, minute stony particles are to be seen in it (G,
<span class="small">II</span>, 27). Fathers Grillet and Bechamel
apparently gave approval (GB, 48) to this method of cure: "Besides
divers sorts of Plants, Gums, and Woods they use to cure diseases and
wounds, they have a way of sucking their patients in that part of the
body in which they feel their pain, and this method is most commonly
very successful."

   <span id="pp_317"></span>**317.**[\*](#pp_317) The idea that not only
the patient but also his relatives and others should abstain from
certain diets was very widespread: "The *Piache's* first prescription is
to impose a general fast on the patient and all his kinsfolk: the
majority of the *Piaches* demand that no one belonging to the house
should eat anything hot, anything cooked, or peppers" (G, <span
class="small">I</span>, 210). With the Caribs, Arawaks ([Sect.
*308*](aflg17.htm#pp_308)), and Warraus, the whole family—father,
mother, brothers, and sisters—is dieted on exactly the same lines as the
invalid. "If a man \[Carib Islander\] gets wounded or ill, he will ask
his brother, sister, or some relation to abstain from eating such or
such a thing. This would make their pain worse even if they were fifty
miles off" (BBR, 250). So also other observances may be incumbent on the
whole family as well as on the patient ([Sect.
*180*](aflg12.htm#pp_180)). Among the Roucouyennes of the upper Yary,
Cayenne, besides the diet, the only license which the doctor allows the
patient is to throw himself into the river when the fever is very high
(Cr, 117). As a matter of fact, when death ensues in spite of the
treatment, this was usually ascribed to disobedience as to
food-restrictions, though other causes were occasionally held
accountable. Thus, the implacable inveteracy of the Spirit causing the
mischief may be too powerful for the doctor to contend against, or some
rival sorcerer, whom the sufferer has unhappily made his <span
id="page_353">p. 353</span> enemy, and who is supposed to have employed
the Yawahu in destroying him (Br, 364-5), will at times come in for a
share of the blame.

   <span id="pp_318"></span>**318.**[\*](#pp_318) Crévaux (250) states
that when consulted, the piai is offered a cigarette: if he accepts it,
this means that he undertakes to visit the sick person. He will not
receive, however, certain gifts (in this this case a comb, child's
hammock, and sifter) offered him until the sick person is completely
cured. "A young girl is sometimes given as payment for the professional
services of the piaiman during sickness, which may account for the scale
of his domestic establishment" (Br, 320). So great is his influence
among the women that his wives are always the choicest (ScR, <span
class="small">I</span>, 423-4). With the Carib Islanders it was
customary for the person cured to express his gratitude by a big feast,
where the Boye, who had helped in the cure, held first rank among the
guests: furthermore, it was incumbent on the convalescent not to omit
the Anakri ([Sect. *89*](aflg07.htm#pp_89)) for the devil \[Familiar
Spirit\] who did not fail to find a place among the assembled company
(RoP, 564).

   <span id="pp_319"></span>**319.**[\*](#pp_319) There is said to have
been on the Islands a class of men and of women who, though in a large
measure alleged to be playing the rôle of piai, can not quite correctly
be classed as such; references to them may conveniently be given here.
Besides the Boyes or Magicians, there are sorcerers (*sorciers*), at
least the people believe so, who, according to what they say, send
charms on them, of very dangerous and fatal kinds, and these sorcerers
they kill when they can catch them; their presence often serves as a
pretext for getting rid of one's enemies (RoP, 474).

>    They believe themselves never to get ill, but to be bewitched; and,
> simply for a headache or stomach-ache, they kill or cause to be killed
> those whom they suspect to have given it to them. It is generally a
> woman ([Sect. *307*](aflg17.htm#pp_307)), since they dare not openly
> attack a man. But before killing her, they ill-treat this unfortunate
> person most cruelly. Their parents and friends go and fetch her, and
> she is then made to search in the earth in different places, and
> ill-treated, until she finds what they believe her to have hidden; and
> very often, the woman, in order to deliver herself from her
> executioners, confesses what is not true, picking up some pieces of
> shell . . . or fish-bones. . . . When the women who are accused as
> witches pick up these different shells they say that it is the remains
> of what the bewitched had eaten, which the pretended witch had buried
> in the ground. Many incisions are then made on her body. She is hanged
> by the feet; a kind of very strong pepper ([Sect.
> *255*](aflg15.htm#pp_255)) called *Piman* is then rubbed in her eyes,
> and she is left for some days without food, until a drunken
> executioner arrives and puts an end to the unfortunate being by
> breaking her head with a club. \[BBR, 232-234.\]

   With regard to the celebration of the anniversary of a Guahibo
chieftain's death on the mainland, there is a record by Crévaux (548) of
the medicine-man casting, or rather blowing, a spell over (*souffle pour
jeter un sortilège à*) the individual who caused the death \[compare
[Sect. *85*](aflg05.htm#pp_85)\]; the others, men and women, then
following his example.

Caribs ([Sect. *309*](aflg17.htm#pp_309)) and from the records left to
us of the Island Caribs ([Sect. *90*](aflg07.htm#pp_90)), the Spirits
invoked were undoubtedly of the "Familiar" class ([Sect.
*314*](aflg17.htm#pp_314)).—W. E. R.
