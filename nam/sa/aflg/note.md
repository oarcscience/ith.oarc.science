## An Inquiry into the Animism and Folk-Lore of the Guiana Indians

### notes to the hypertext transcription

------------------------------------------------------------------------

All of the stories and many of the direct quotations in this book are
presented in a smaller font in the printed edition to set them apart
from the author's own commentary. In this electronic edition, those
sections have been rendered indented (i.e., inside of &lt;blockquote&gt;
tags).

There are internal references to other parts of the text throughout, and
all of these have been linked to allow for ease of navigation. In
addition, every story and numbered section is preceded by a red asterisk
link (i.e., <u>\*</u>), which is a self-referential anchor. This acts as
a temporary bookmark, and by clicking on this anchor before following
other links, you will be able to use your browser's back button to
return directly to the section that you were reading (and not to the
beginning of the file) after following internal links. Citations of
William Henry Brett's [Legends and Myths of the Aboriginal Indians of
British Guiana](../lmbg/index) have also been linked, as these books
were posted to sacred-texts simultaneously.
