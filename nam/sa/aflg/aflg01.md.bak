## C<span class="small">HAPTER</span> I NO EVIDENCE OF BELIEF IN A SUPREME BEING

   <span class="small">Originally, Indians had no terms expressive of
the conception of a Supreme Being; such terms as they now possess have
been framed to suit civilized, especially missionary, requirements
(*[1](#pp_1)*).<span id="page_117_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_117_note_1.md) On
the other hand, traditions of certain Tribal Heroes have been
unconsciously assumed as indicative of the existence among the natives
of the knowledge of a God (*[2](#pp_2)*.md).</span>

   <span id="pp_1"></span>**1.**[\*](#pp_1.md) Careful investigation forces
one to the conclusion that, on the evidence, the native tribes of Guiana
had no idea of a Supreme Being in the modern conception of the term.
This contention is confirmed in a way by Gumilla (<span
class="small">II</span>, 7),<span
id="page_117_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_117_note_2.md) one of the early
missionary fathers on the Orinoco, who writes as follows:

>    In three nations which will be mentioned directly they have a word
> indicative, after their fashion, of God: we trust that time and labor
> will also reveal, in other tribes, a name which until now they have
> furnished no sign of recognizing either by word or expression. Even in
> the said nations no outward ceremony of divine worship or adoration
> has been observed. Nor are the terms which express God in the
> different languages so particularized and indubitable as to convince
> us of their sure and certain signification. The Caribs call God
> Quiyumocón, *i. e.*, Our Big Father, but it is not sufficiently clear
> whether they mean by this expression the First Cause or the most
> ancient of their ancestors. The Salivas say that Púru made all that is
> good; that he lives in the expanse of the sky . . . The Betoyes,
> before their conversion, used to say that the Sun was God, and in
> their language, they speak of both God and Sun as Theos.

   The nations of the upper Orinoco, the Atabapo, and the Inirida, as
Humboldt records, have no worship other than that of the powers of
Nature: they call the good principle Cachimana; it is the Manito, the
Great Spirit, that regulates the seasons and favors the harvests (AVH,
<span class="small">II</span>, 362). In Cayenne there is the similar
evidence of the Jesuits Grillet and Bechamel (25): "The Nouragues and
the Acoquas, in Matters of Religion, are the same with the Galibis. They
acknowledge there is a God, but do not worship him. They say he dwells
in Heaven, without knowing whether he is a Spirit or no, but rather seem
to believe he has a body. . . The Nouragues and the Acoquas call him
Maire, and never talk of him but in fabulous stories." They <span
id="page_118">p. 118</span> have not even in their language any suitable
term to express the Divinity, still less the homage and respect due to
him (PBa, 218). The present-day British Guiana Carib name for God is
identical with that just given, Tamosi-Kabutana, Old Man-Sky \[Kabu =
the Sun\], figuratively The Ancient of Heaven, or simply Tamosi, without
particularizing. But this word is undoubtedly the same as *tamuchi*, the
Cayenne Carib term for the head-man or chief of a tribe; it serves also
to designate a grandfather (PBa, 218). The same remark perhaps may be
applicable to *theos*, the word given by Gumilla as the Betoya word for
the Divine Person, recognizable in the terms *tuchao* (Cr, 372) and
*tushaúa* (HWB, 241, 244), the name given to the chief, head-man, of the
tribe or nation, in the upper and lower Amazons, respectively.
Koch-Grünberg (<span class="small">II</span>, 82) talks of Tuschaua as
being Lingoa Geral. Wallace (348), too, says that the Indians of the
Amazon appear to have no definite idea of a God. The Arawak terms for
the Christian deity also show signs that they have been adapted to
express a conception to which they could have been introduced only
within modern times, a statement which is made advisedly, because in
none of the Arawak myths and legends relative to the Creation, even in
those published by clerics, is there a single reference to the All-Maker
(Br, 58) under the term of Wa’chinachi, Our Father,
Wa’murretakuon(na)chi, Our Maker, or even Aiomun Kondi, Dweller on High.
It is very noteworthy that the same discrepancy as to the alleged word
for God is at once apparent in almost all the Creation myths of the
other tribes that so far I have managed to unearth: for example, the
Warrau word (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 515) *kwarisabarote*,
really intended for *kwaresa ba-arautu*, meaning literally 'on-top
belonging-to.' The only exception perhaps would seem to be the Warrau
Kanonatu, Our Maker (IT, 366), referred to by Brett in his Warrau story
of the origin of the Caribs ([BrB, 62](../lmbg/lmbg2b.htm#page_62).md),
where its introduction is certainly suspicious. "Some \[of the Orinoco\]
tribes, Father Caulin tells us, considered the Sun as the Supreme Being
and First Cause; it was to him that they attributed the productions of
the earth, scanty or copious rains, and all other temporal blessings;
others, on the contrary, believed that everything depended on the
influence of the moon, and conceived, when she suffered an eclipse, that
she was angry with them." (FD, 51.) It is known that the Chaimas,
Cumanagotos, Tamanacs, and other original tribes of the Carib people,
worshipped (*adoraban*) the Sun and Moon (AR, 185). For perhaps the most
extraordinary conception met with, however, concerning ideas of a
Supreme Being, I would quote the reply given to Acuña (97) by a cacique
of one of the Amazon tribes: "He told me himself was God, and begotten
by the Sun, affirming that his Soul went every night into Heaven to give
orders for the succeeding Day, and to regulate the Government of the
Universe!" The Tupi language, at least, as taught by the old Jesuits,
has a word, *tupána*, signifying God (HWB, 259). And so <span
id="page_119">p. 119</span> it happened that the little china dolls
which Koch-Grünberg (<span class="small">I</span>, 184) presented to the
women and children on the Aiary River (Rio Negro) were generally called
*tupána*: the people took them for figures of saints from missionary
times.

   <span id="pp_2"></span>**2.**[\*](#pp_2.md) Conversely, it is
interesting to note how both travellers and missionaries have assumed
almost unconsciously the Indian traditions of certain mythic Heroes to
be more or less indicative of the view no doubt *a priori*
conscientiously held by the former that the native was not without the
knowledge of a God. Thus, Hilhouse (HiC, 244) writing in 1832, makes the
statement, blindly followed, strangely enough, by Schomburgk (ScR, <span
class="small">II</span>, 319) in 1848, that "The Indians acknowledge the
existence of a superior divinity, the universal creator; and most
tribes, also, believe in a subservient power, whose particular province
is the protection of their nation. Amongst the Arawaaks, Aluberi is the
supreme being, and Kururumanny the god or patron (*Schutz gott*) of the
Arawaak nation," etc. With regard to the former there is a very probable
reference to him under the name of Hubuiri, some three centuries
previously, in the *Archivos de Indias: Patronato* (quoted by Rodway in
*Timehri* for 1895, p. 9), where, in an account of the Provinces and
Nations of the Aruacas \[Arawaks\] by Rodrigo de Navarrete, the latter
says: "From those whom I have frequently kept in my house, I have
understood that their belief and object of adoration is the firmament or
heavens, because they say that in the greater heaven there is a powerful
lord and a great lady . . . when they die, their souls will go with
Hubuiri, as they call the great and powerful lord in heaven." This same
Alubiri, or Hubuiri, is still recognizable as Haburi ([Sect.
*9*](aflg02.htm#pp_9).md) in the stories related by me, and as Abore, the
Warrau "Father of Inventions" in the legend told by Brett ([BrB,
76](../lmbg/lmbg2b.htm#page_76).md). In his Arawak vocabulary the name for
God is given by Schomburgk (SCR, <span class="small">II</span>, 515) as
Kururumanni: Brett (Br, 58), however, is more correct in saying. that it
is the Warraus who "sometimes use the word 'Korroromana' when speaking
of God; but it is doubtful what ideas some of them attach to that name."
As a matter of fact, both of these would-be deities, Alubiri ([Sect.
*3*](aflg02.htm#pp_3)) and Kororomanna ([Sect. *19*](aflg02.htm#pp_19).md),
were Arawak and Warrau Tribal Heroes, respectively. Similar remarks may
be made of Makunaima and Pia ([Sects. *29-41*), and of Amalivaca
(](aflg02.htm#pp_29)[Sect. *42*](aflg02.htm#pp_42).md). The name Amalivaca
is spread over a region of more than five thousand square leagues.

>    He is found designated as "the father of mankind," or "our great
> grandfather," as far as to the Carribbee nations. . . . *Amalivaca* is
> not originally the *Great Spirit*, the *Aged of Heaven*, the invisible
