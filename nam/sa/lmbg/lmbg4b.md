### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_127">p. 127</span>

<span id="page_127_note_1"></span>[1](#page_127_fr_1) "Ahkoo," the
*agouti*, or *acouri*. This little animal takes the part which, in the
corresponding Caribi legend, is given to "Maipuri," the *tapir*. The
*tree* itself, the source of all cultivation, is the same in both; and
the *monkey*, though in different ways, releases the pent up waters of
the flood.

Though differing widely now, the ancient traditions, as well as the
languages spoken by these two nations, and some others, now widely
spread, point to a common origin at some remote period.

<span id="footnotes_page_130">p. 130</span>

<span id="page_130_note_1"></span>[1](#page_130_fr_1) "Arawata," in the
Caribi; Spanish, "Araguato."

<span id="footnotes_page_132">p. 132</span>

<span id="page_132_note_1"></span>[1](#page_132_fr_1) A bush fowl,
called by the Acawoios "Okura."

<span id="page_132_note_2"></span>[2](#page_132_fr_2) The tongue of the
alligator, previous to this calamity, is supposed to have been long and
flexible.

<span id="footnotes_page_149">p. 149</span>

<span id="page_149_note_1"></span>[1](#page_149_fr_1) Arrows thus
pointed are believed by the natives to inflict greater agony than any
other weapon; and the terror they inspire is often heightened by
superstition.

<span id="footnotes_page_153">p. 153</span>

<span id="page_153_note_1"></span>[1](#page_153_fr_1) Archdeacon Jones
and myself, on the Upper Demerara, in 1865. That "Kanáima" murderer, we
found, had followed his victim and friends from the vicinity of Roráima
to Georgetown and back, killing him on his return.

<span id="footnotes_page_154">p. 154</span>

<span id="page_154_note_1"></span>[1](#page_154_fr_1) A set of jaguar's
claws, hung up in sorcerer's hut, have the same threatening
signification.

<span id="footnotes_page_158">p. 158</span>

<span id="page_158_note_1"></span>[1](#page_158_fr_1) In 1845, all the
Acawoios, and many Caribs, went to that man, near the river Cako. We
were unable to stop the movement. They were so numerous that food could
not be got, so the imposture collapsed under the weight of too great
success. The man was not an Indian, and his ultimate object was never
known.

To "Capui" (the moon), one of the leading Acawoios, he gave a
"commission" as from the Lord. It had a *leaden seal* attached, and was
written in hieroglyphic characters, invented, of course, by himself.
Those were the days of "Joe Smith's" early Mormon successes, and our
impostor seemed to imitate him as far as he could.
