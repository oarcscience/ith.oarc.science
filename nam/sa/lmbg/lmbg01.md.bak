## PREFACE

------------------------------------------------------------------------

T<span class="small">HE</span> chief object of the present work has been
to preserve, and to give at one view, the more serious
traditions—religious, mythological, and historical—of the four
aboriginal races who live nearest the shores of Guiana.

 A few of these legends appeared in a former work on the Indian tribes.
To them are here added the more copious results of systematic research,
extending over many years. A metrical form has been adopted, as
agreeable to the native style in former days, when their national
traditions were recited with peculiar intonation—chanted, rather than
told.

 The head-men, mostly sorcerers, who guarded, and from time to time
recited them, have, in the vicinity of our missions, nearly all passed
away. Many time-honoured legends have expired with them, as the old
state of things has yielded to the spread of Christianity.

 The foregoing remarks apply only to the more *serious* traditions.
Fanciful legends, of which a few specimens are also given here, are
common to all. Some are very popular, and will probably continue to be
told, for the purpose of amusement, over their evening fires, as long as
the native languages shall be spoken.
