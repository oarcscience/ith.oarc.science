<span id="page_168">p. 168</span><br />
    Thus our young men addressed<br />
    Their friend Bahmoo, a guest,<br />
Who had come to their "place" of adventures in quest,<br />

And tell you beforehand what <em>I</em> mean to do.<br />
    The first frog that is found<br />
    Upon yon marshy ground,<br />
I will jump on his back, and will twist his neck round,<br />

Who o'erheard Bahmoo's boast, and forthwith, in the way,<br />

There he seemed half asleep; while around him awoke<br />
A deafening chorus of croak upon croak.<br />
</td>

But Bahmoo half shrunk from the row those frogs made,<br />

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span><br />

And his comrades enjoyed it. Although no one spoke,<br />
 He knew they were laughing aside.<br />
So he ran at that first frog, and sprang on his back,<br />
And, to twist round his head, threw his arms round his neck,<br />
 And then—found himself in the tide!<br />
For the frog-chief, returning his ardent embrace,<br />
Said," Come, my dear friend, with me, home to my place,<br />
 Just to <em>see</em> it, if not to abide."<br />
    Then he sprang off the ground,<br />
    And with wonderful bound<br />
And a splash, that was heard a long distance around,<br />
 They plunged in where the deep waters glide.<br />

Which possessed that huge frog, in his paws held him tight;<br />

He said," Mount on my back, it is much the best way,<br />
And we will enjoy ourselves this pleasant day,<br />
 As over the river we go.<br />
We will sing, as we swim along, merry and gay:<br />
And my people, as chorus, shall join in the lay,<br />

Well, at first I must say that they thought it no fun:<br />
 To see their friend caught by the frog.<br />
But as soon as they saw him upon the frog's back,<br />
With loud peals of laughter, they cried, "Twist his neck,<br />
 And bring him here dead as a log.<br />

Of all our bold hunters we'll make you the head,<br />

Heard his comrades laugh loudly, and join in it too.<br />

For your people are killing mine yonder, I know.<br />

When the young men had finished their frog-hunt, they hailed<br />
For Bahmoo to swim back; but entreaties all failed<br />
 To draw him from that other side.<br />
He dreaded their laughter, and would not again<br />
 Adventure himself in the tide,<br />
Lest that frog he should meet. So he had to remain,<br />

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_171">p. 171</span>

<span id="page_171_note_1"></span>[1](#page_171_fr_1) The frog chorus in
this legend, when taken up by the native audience, all admirable mimics,
has a most amusing effect.

<span id="footnotes_page_175">p. 175</span>

<span id="page_175_note_1"></span>[1](#page_175_fr_1) "Bernau's
Missionary Labours," p. 167.

<span id="page_175_note_2"></span>[2](#page_175_fr_2) The tiger slayer,
a Carib, and the snake-catcher, an Arawâk, are not mythical personages.
They belonged to the last generation, and both became Christian
converts. The former would attack any jaguar, and cleave his skull with
axe or cutlass. Of the skill and daring displayed by the latter in the
capture of a kolokonāro snake, with only a cord and forked stick, the
writer was an eye-witness.

<span id="footnotes_page_176">p. 176</span>

<span id="page_176_note_1"></span>[1](#page_176_fr_1) An Araidai, or
goblin of the woods, who had become dissatisfied with his coarse and
matted locks, and wished them to be made like those of human beings.
Pahndun, a captive, undertook to gratify him, with the above result.

<span id="footnotes_page_178">p. 178</span>

<span id="page_178_note_1"></span>[1](#page_178_fr_1) From the "Ebesōtu"
(*changed* or *transformed*), heroine of the above legend, the Ebesoana
(Arawâk family) take their name.

The names of those families all descend in the *female* line, and no
individual was permitted to marry another of the same family name.

<span id="footnotes_page_179">p. 179</span>

<span id="page_179_note_1"></span>[1](#page_179_fr_1) From the above
union, the existing Demaréna (Arawâk family) are supposed to have
sprung. They bear, of course, their mother's family name; and in ancient
days considered it "the correct thing," in accordance with the legend,
to intermarry solely with their father's family—the "Korobohána."

These latter have a strange legend of their own. They believe that they
originally came from above the clouds. The weight of a heavy woman broke
the rope by which they were descending; and communication was thus cut
off between those who had reached the ground and those remaining above.
The Great Spirit, pitying the latter, supplied them with wings and
plumage; and they came down, to colonise the trees above the heads of
their brethren—still privileged to live near, and to converse with them,
though changed into "Koriouka" *parrots*.

This legend, though grotesque, affords another instance of the belief
(which our pages have shown) expressed by various myths, but almost
universal amongst the aboriginal races of Guiana: of a *descent* from a
*higher* region, or state of existence.

<span id="footnotes_page_181">p. 181</span>

<span id="page_181_note_1"></span>[1](#page_181_fr_1) "Walyarima" is the
name of the animal whose appearance was assumed by the lover while
swimming the river. "To-eyborōri" and "To-eyza" are titles, denoting
authority, masculine and feminine respectively. The *proper names* seem
to have been lost in the lapse of years.

<span id="footnotes_page_186">p. 186</span>

<span id="page_186_note_1"></span>[1](#page_186_fr_1) This agrees with
the old legends, told to Raleigh and others. But many Indians now say
that the male infants were *always* destroyed, and their fathers warned
*not to return*, on pain of death.

With regard to the subject in general. The expeditions for war and
plunder, so common nmongst the South American tribes in former ages,
would often draw away all the males in a district capable of bearing
arms, and sometimes they *never returned*. The women, left by
themselves, <span id="footnotes_page_187">p. 187</span> drew together
for mutual defence; and being, in those days, all well trained to the
bow, would (like the women of the Caribi islands) defend their homes and
children fiercely agninst all comers.

Such a state of things—said still to exist in some wild regions of that
vast continent—will account for the tales of Orellana and others, of
their *fights with Amazons*.

It does not, of course, account for the murder of husbands, and utter
rejection of marital authority, in the legend before us. Whether that
tale ever had any foundation in fact, it is impossible to say. Wild and
unnatural as it is, it has deeply impressed the minds of the Aborigines;
and the writer has, in his researches, come upon various legends (both
tragical and comical) founded on the *scarcity of wives*, after their
(supposed) terrible Exodus.

<span id="page_187_note_1"></span>[1](#page_187_fr_1) The spotted "arua"
(or harua) of the Arawâks, spelt *jaguar* by the Spanish discoverers, is
commonly called "tiger" by the colonists who frequent the bush. It is
called "tobi" by the Waraus, and "kaikusi" by the Caribs and Acawoios.

<span id="footnotes_page_189">p. 189</span>

<span id="page_189_note_1"></span>[1](#page_189_fr_1) The great comet of
1843.

<span id="page_189_note_2"></span>[2](#page_189_fr_2) The great demon of
darkness, who causes eclipses.

<span id="footnotes_page_190">p. 190</span>

<span id="page_190_note_1"></span>[1](#page_190_fr_1) The native ideas
respecting the constellations differ widely from ours. For instance, the
Southern Cross is supposed, by many clans, to represent a "paui" bird
resting on a tree. The star, *Beta Centauri*, is a hunter stealthily
approaching it. *Alpha Centauri* is the hunter's torch (or firebrand),
held *behind him*, so as not to alarm the bird by its glare. Some call
it another hunter, lighting the first. Other constellations have
*narratives* connected with them; of these, "Serikoai," the legend given
here, is the most interesting specimen.

<span id="footnotes_page_199">p. 199</span>

<span id="page_199_note_1"></span>[1](#page_199_fr_1) The Pleiades.

<span id="page_199_note_2"></span>[2](#page_199_fr_2) The Hyades
represent the tapir's head. The red eye is Aldebaran.

<span id="footnotes_page_200">p. 200</span>

<span id="page_200_note_1"></span>[1](#page_200_fr_1) The constellation
Orion: Rigel indicating the upper part of the sound limb.

<span id="footnotes_page_201">p. 201</span>

<span id="page_201_note_1"></span>[1](#page_201_fr_1) This great fall is
822 feet in total height, by 369 feet in width. Its upper part is 741
feet perpendicular.
