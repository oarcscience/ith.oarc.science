La Barre. The English had by that time made a settlement on the Coma, or
Surinam, which, in 1667, was exchanged with the Dutch for "New Holland,"
the present New York. Essequibo and Berbice (now English) were colonised
by the Dutch in the early part of the seventeenth century, and remained
in their possession nearly two hundred years. Demerara was also founded
by them, though at a much later period.

As the Caribs themselves have always been accused of cannibalism, it is
but fair to the survivors of that race in Guiana, to say that all those
whom I have spoken with deny that their fathers ever were guilty of it,
save in mimic action, as a vaunt or threat, to terrify a foe.

Humboldt, who treats the subject fully in his "Narrative," acquits the
continental Caribs of the charge, while admitting the cannibalism of the
Cabrés (as stated above), of various other inland tribes, and of the
*Caribs of the islands* in former days.

<span id="page_109_note_1"></span>[1](#page_109_fr_1) There is an
episode, usually given here, of a "cocorite" palm, which mankind strove
to ascend, because its top reached the heavens. A poor woman, not in a
condition to climb, led the way. When halfway up she was turned into
stone by terror and exhaustion. None could help her, and none could pass
over her. All who tried to do so became rocks likewise. The terrified
survivors then climbed the komoo, and were saved.

<span id="footnotes_page_114">p. 114</span>

<span id="page_114_note_1"></span>[1](#page_114_fr_1) Humboldt, who
records the legend of Amalivaca, considers those *rock-carvings* to be
"traces of an ancient civilisation, which may have belonged to an epoch
when the tribes, which we now distinguish by various names and races,
were still unknown."

Whether the mystery attached to those rude sculptures will ever be
solved, *even in part*, it is at present impossible to say. In the
interest of science, it is desirable that a collection of photographs of
the most remarkable—not only on the Orinaco, but (if possible) from the
Rio Negro to the Corentyn—should be made and compared.
