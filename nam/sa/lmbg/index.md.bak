### by William Henry Brett

#### \[London, 1880\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

William Henry Brett was a missionary to the Natives of British Guiana,
and by his own account, was quite evangelical. Thus, as with all works
written by agents of Western power, this book should be read with care.
In addition, the entire book is written in very regular meter. The
relentless rhythms and rhymes, combined with the sometimes ridiculous
portrayal of the Natives as late Romantic 'savages', sometimes invite
comparison with Dr. Seuss (to the advantage of which poet, I leave the
reader to decide). He spends a good amount of time extolling the virtues
of English colonialism, and the 'Black Legend' (of Spanish atrocities in
America) is repeatedly mentioned, while the English are portrayed as the
kind-hearted civilizers and bearers of the true Christian gospel. In
spite of all this, the book is an important record because it is the
earliest record we have of many of these stories.

Please note that the original book had a number of illustrations which
are not reproducable because the copy we were working from was a library
photocopy.
