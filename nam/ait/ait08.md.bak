### THE RED SWAN.

GREAT chief, Red Thunder, was traveling with his wife and three children
to a council of the nations. When they were near the place appointed for
the meeting, one of the children saw a beautiful white bird winging its
way high in the air. He pointed upwards, clapping his hands with
delight, for it was flying swiftly towards the earth and the sun was
shining on its broad back and wings.

While the smile was on their faces the bird suddenly appeared above
them, and in a moment struck their mother to the earth, driving her into
the ground so that no portion of her body remained. The force of the
blow was so great that the bird itself was broken in pieces and its
plumes were scattered far and wide. The Indians assembled at the
council, rushed forth eagerly to secure them; for a white feather is not
easily procured and is highly prized in time of war.

Red Thunder stood speechless in his

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

great agony. Then taking his little ones with him he tied into the
forest, and no man ever saw him again. He built himself a lodge and
never passed far from its doorway. When Winter shook his white locks and
covered the land with snow, Red Thunder fell, shot by an unseen arrow.

Thus the three boys were left alone. Even the eldest was not large
enough or strong enough to bring home much food, and all that they could
do was to set snares for rabbits. The animals were sorry for them and
took them in charge. The squirrels dropped nuts at their doorway, and a
great brown bear kept guard over them at night. They were too young to
remember much of their parents, and they were brave boys, who tried
their best to learn how to hunt and fish. The eldest soon became
skillful and he taught his brothers.

When they were all able to take care of themselves, the eldest wanted to
leave them and go to see the world, to find other lodges and bring home
wives for each of them. The younger ones would not hear of this, and
said that they had gone along so far well without strangers, and they
could still do without them. So

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

they continued to live together and no more was said about any of them
leaving.

One day they wanted new quivers for their arrows. One made his of otter,
another chose sheep, and a third took wolf skin. Then they thought it
well to make new arrows. They made many, some being of oak and a few,
very precious, of the thigh-bone of the buck. It took them much longer
to fashion the heads of flint and sandstone; but at last all were
finished, and they were ready for a grand hunt. They laid wagers with
one another as to who should come in first with game, each one agreeing
to kill only the animal he was in the habit of taking, and not to meddle
with what he knew belonged to his brother.

The youngest, named Deep Voice, had not gone far when he met a black
bear, which according to the agreement he was not to kill. But the
animal was so close to him that he could not refrain from taking aim.
The bear fell dead at his feet. His scruples were gone then, so he began
skinning it.

Soon his eyes troubled him and he rubbed them with his bloody hands,
when, on looking up, everything appeared red. He went to the brook and
washed

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

his hands and face, but the same red hue was still on the trees, the
ground, and even on the skin of the black bear. He heard a strange
noise, and leaving the animal partly skinned, went to see whence it
came.

By following the sound he came to the shore of a great lake, where he
saw a beautiful swan swimming. Its feathers were not like those of any
other swan he had ever seen, for they were a brilliant scarlet and
glistened in the sun.

He drew one of his arrows and fired at it, but the arrow fell short of
its mark. He shot again and again until his quiver was empty. Still the
swan remained dipping its long neck into the water, seemingly ignorant
of the hunter's presence.

Then he remembered that three magic arrows which had belonged to his
father were in the wigwam. At any other time he would not have thought
of meddling with them; but he was determined to secure this beautiful
bird. He ran quickly to the lodge, brought the arrows and fired them.
The first went very near the bird, but did not strike it. The second
also fell harmless in the water. The third struck the swan in the neck;
but she rose immediately and flew towards the setting sun.

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

Deep Voice was disappointed, and knowing that his brothers would be
angry about the loss of the arrows, he rushed into the water and secured
the first two, but found that the third had been carried off by the red
swan.

He thought that as the bird was wounded it could not fly far, so,
placing the magic arrows in his quiver, he ran on to overtake it. Over
hills and prairies, through the forests and out on the plain he went,
till at last it grew dark and he lost sight of the swan.

On coming out of the forest he heard voices in the distance, and knew
that people could not be far off. He looked about and saw a large town
on a distant hill and heard the watchman, an old owl, call out, "We are
visited," to which the people answered with a loud "Hallo!"

Deep Voice approached the watchman and told him that he came for no evil
purpose, but merely to ask for shelter. The owl said nothing, but led
him to the lodge of the Chief, and told him to enter.

"Come in, come in," said the Chief; "sit there," he added, as the young
man appeared.

He was given food to eat and but few questions were asked him.

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

By and by the Chief, who had been watching him closely, said, "Daughter,
take our son-in-law's moccasins, and if they need mending, do it for
him."

Deep Voice was much astonished to find himself married at such short
notice, but made up his mind to let one of his brothers have her for his
wife. She was not good-looking and she proved herself bad-tempered by
snatching the moccasins in such a surly manner that Deep Voice ran after
her, took them from her and hung them up himself.

Being very tired he soon fell asleep. Early next morning he said to the
girl: "Which way did the red swan go?"

"Do you think you can catch it?" she said, and turned angrily away.

Yes," he answered.

"Foolishness!" said the girl; but as he persisted, she went to the door
and showed him the direction in which the bird had flown.

It was still dark, and as the road was strange to him he traveled
slowly. When daylight came he started to run and ran all day as fast as
lie could. Towards night he was almost exhausted and was glad to find
himself near another village, where he might be able to rest.

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

This village also had an owl for a watchman, a large, gray bird, who saw
him at a distance and called to those in the camp, "Tu-who! we are
visited."

Deep Voice was shown to the lodge of the Chief and treated exactly as on
the first night. This time the Chief's daughter was beautiful and gentle
in her ways. "She shall be for my elder brother," thought the boy, "for
he has always been kind to me."

He slept soundly all night and it was nearly dawn when he awoke; but he
lost no time, for the Chief's daughter was ready to answer his questions
at once. She told him the red swan had passed about the middle of the
previous afternoon, showed him the exact course it took and pointed out
the shortest road to the prairie.

He went slowly until sunrise and then ran as before. He was a swift
runner, for he could shoot an arrow and then pass it in its flight so
that it would fall behind him. He did this many times on the second day,
for it helped him to travel faster. Towards evening, not seeing any
town, he went more leisurely, thinking that he would have to travel all
night.

Soon after dark he saw a glow of light

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

in the woods, and found when he went nearer that it came from a small,
low lodge. He went cautiously on and looked in at the doorway. An old
man was sitting by the fire, his head bent forward on his breast.

Although Deep Voice had not made the slightest noise the old man called
out, "Come in, my grandson."

The boy entered.

"Take a seat there," said the old man, pointing to a corner opposite him
by the fire. "Now dry your things, for you must be tired, and I will
cook supper for you. My kettle of water stands near the fire."

Deep Voice had been looking about the fireplace, but had seen no kettle.
Now there appeared a small earthen pot filled with water. The old man
took one grain of corn and one whortleberry, dropped them into the
[pot](errata.htm#0.md) and set it where it would boil. Deep Voice was
hungry and thought to himself that there was small chance of a good
supper.

When the water boiled the old man took the kettle off, handed him a dish
and spoon made of the same material as the pot and told him to help
himself.

Deep Voice found the soup so good that

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

he helped himself again and again until he had taken all there was. He
felt ashamed, but he was still hungry.

Before he could speak, the old man said, "Eat, eat, my grandchild, help
yourself," and motioned to the pot, which was immediately refilled.

Deep Voice again helped himself to all the soup and again the kettle was
filled, and his hunger was satisfied. Then the pot vanished.

"My grandchild," said the old man, when Deep Voice had finished, "you
have set out on a difficult journey, but you will succeed. *Only be
determined*, and be prepared for whatever may happen. Tomorrow you will
go on your way until the sun sets, when you will find one of my
fellow-magicians. He will give you food and shelter and will tell you
more than I am permitted to do. *Only be firm*. On the day beyond
to-morrow you will meet still another who will tell you all you wish to
know and how you are to gain your wish."

Deep Voice lay down on the buffalo skins, which were white and soft, and
slept soundly; for the old man's words made him very happy.

The magician prepared his breakfast as

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

he had done the supper, after which the boy went on his way. He found
the second magician as he had been told, and was given a supper from a
magic kettle, and a couch upon white buffalo robes.

The second magician did not seem so sure of the young man's success.
"Many have gone this way before you," said he, "and none have ever come
back. We shall see, we shall see."

This was said to try the courage of Deep Voice; but he remembered what
the first magician had told him and was firm in his resolution.

After breakfast next day he ran forward quickly, for he was anxious to
meet the third magician who should tell him all about the red swan. But
though he ran all day he did not get to the third lodge any earlier than
he had reached the others.

After a supper prepared as on the previous nights, the magician said to
him: "My grandchild, to-morrow night you will come to the lodge of the
Red Swan. She is not a bird, but a beautiful girl, the most beautiful
that ever lived. Her father is a magician and rich in wampum. This
wampum is of much value, for many of the shells were brought from the
Great

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Salt Lake; but he
prizes his daughter far more than all. The Red Swan loves her father,
and all her life is spent in making him comfortable. The old man has met
with a misfortune, having lost his cap of wampum which used to be
fastened to his scalp and was never removed, night or day. A tribe of
Indians, who had heard of it, one day sent to him, saying that their
Chief's daughter was very ill and that but one thing could cure her—a
sight of this magic cap of wampum. The magician did not suspect the
messengers, though he tried to persuade them to bring the maiden to him.
They declared that she could not be moved; whereupon the old man tore
off his cap, though it gave him much pain to do so, and sent it to the
Chief. The story was all a pretense; and when they got the cap they made
fun of it and placed it on a pole for the birds to peck at, and the
stranger to ridicule. The old man is not strong enough to get the cap
back; but he has been told that a young warrior shall some day procure
it for him. The Red Swan goes forth [in](errata.htm#1.md) the Moon of
Falling Leaves to seek for this Brave, and she has promised to be the
wife of him who is successful. My grandchild, many have followed her and
have

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

failed, but I think you will be more favored. When you are seated in the
lodge of the Red Swan, the magician will ask you many things. Tell him
your dreams and what your guardian spirits have done for you. Then he
will ask you to recover his cap of wampum and will show you what you are
to do to find and punish the wicked possessors of it."

Deep Voice was greatly pleased to hear that he might win such a
beautiful wife. He leaped and ran gaily through the forest the next day,
and the idea that he might fail never entered his mind. Towards evening
he heard deep groans, which he believed came from the lodge of the Red
Swan.

It was not long before he reached a fine wigwam, and on entering saw the
magician seated in the center, holding his head with both hands and
moaning with pain.

The old man prepared supper, for no one was allowed to see the Red Swan,
or even to know that she was in the wigwam. But Deep Voice saw a curtain
dividing the lodge, and thought that he heard a rustle of wings.

His heart did not fail him, and he answered the old man's questions
patiently

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

and truthfully. When he told his dreams, the magician shook his head,
saying, "No, that is not the one, that is not it," to each, until Deep
Voice thought he would not tell him any more. He was not willing,
however, to give up the Red Swan, so at last he remembered a dream
wholly different from the others, which he straightway told.

The magician became quite excited before he had finished his story, and
exclaimed: "That's it, that's it! You will cause me to live! That is
what I have been waiting for a young man to say. Will you go and get my
cap for me?"

"Yes," said Deep Voice, "and on the day beyond to-morrow when you hear
the voice of the night-hawk, you must put your head out of the door of
the lodge. You will see me coming with the cap, which I will fasten on
your head before I enter. The magic food that I have eaten has given me
the power to change my form, so I shall come as a night-hawk, and will
give the cry to let you know that I am successful. Have ready your
war-club that I may seize it to strike with when I come."

Deep Voice had not known when he began speaking what he would say, but

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

as the magician looked at him the words came. In spite of all the tales
that he had heard about the young men who had gone before him, and the
magician told him many that night, Deep Voice was anxious to begin his
task. He rose early and went in the direction pointed out to him.

When he saw the cap at a distance he thought that no one was near it;
but as he went nearer he found that those about it were as the hanging
leaves for number. Knowing that he could not pass unharmed through so
great a crowd, he changed himself into a humming-bird and flew close
enough to the cap to examine it, but did not touch it, for fear an arrow
might be aimed at him.

The cap was tied securely to a tall pole and no bird could unfasten it
without his actions being noticed. Deep Voice, therefore, changed
himself into the down of a dandelion and lighted on the cap itself. He
thrust his silver fingers under and between the cords, untied them, and
lifted the cap slowly, for it was a great weight for so small a thing to
carry.

When the crowd below saw the cap moving, and that it was being carried
away, they raised a great shout and ran after it,

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

<span id="img_05300"></span>

[![“He flew swiftly toward the magician's lodge.”](tn/05300.jpg)

“He flew swiftly toward the magician's lodge.”  

shooting clouds of arrows as they went. The wind which blew the arrows
blew the down out of their reach; so it was soon far enough from them to
be safe for Deep Voice to take the form of a bird. As a night-hawk he
flew swiftly towards the magician's lodge, giving the call he had named
as a signal.

The old man heard him and looked out. Deep Voice flew close to him and
dropped the cap upon his head; then changing himself into a man, he
seized the war-club which the magician had placed just outside the
lodge, and with one powerful blow fastened the cap securely, but knocked
the old man senseless. When he recovered, what was the surprise of Deep
Voice to see, not the old magician who had entertained him, but a
handsome young warrior who said to him, "Thank you, my *friend*, for the
bravery and kindness by which you have restored my youth and strength."

He urged Deep Voice to remain in his lodge as his guest. They hunted
together many days and became fast friends. At last Deep Voice wished to
return to his brothers. The young magician then brought out
gifts—buffalo robes and deer skin white as snow, strings and belts of

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

wampum, as much as he could carry, enough to make him a great man in any
country.

During all his stay nothing had been said about the Red Swan. This day,
as they were smoking their farewell pipe, the young magician said to
Deep Voice: "My brother, you know the reward that was to be for him who
restored my cap of wampum. I have given you riches that will be all that
you will want as long as you live. I now give you the best gift of all."

At this the Red Swan appeared.

"Take her," said the magician; "she is my sister, let her be your wife."

So Deep Voice and the Red Swan went home by the way he came, stopping at
the lodges of the old magicians to take with them the wives for his
brothers. The Red Swan far surpassed them in beauty and loveliness, and
her daughters and their daughters have ever been known as the handsomest
women of the tribe.
