<P ALIGN="CENTER">OBITUARY NOTICE.</P>
<P>JOSEPH LA FLESCHE, formerly chief of the Omaha tribe, died at his farm near Bancroft, Nebraska, September, 1888. This remarkable man was deeply versed in Indian lore, and had won his honors by a full compliance with Indian customs and superstitions. He was also an acute observer and reasoner, and foresaw tile inevitable change which awaited the Indians. As chief, in which function he was confirmed by United States authority, he was a leader of his people in the direction of civilization. At a later period, he discerned that the tribal system was an obstacle to the advancement of his race, and he not only abandoned his official position, but was the means of the overthrow of the office of chief. During his later years he was deeply interested in the preservation of the history and traditions of his race, and rendered invaluable assistance to laborers engaged in the task.</P>
