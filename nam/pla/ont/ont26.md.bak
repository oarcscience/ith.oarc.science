SPOTTED EAGLE, Mas-te-pe-ne and Bull Child, prominent medicine men, were
chosen by the chiefs to take charge of the ceremonies to be given inside
the Sun-lodge. On the morning of the fifth day they walked slowly
through camp, dancing and blowing their medicine whistles as a signal to
the tribe that they were proceeding to the Sun-lodge.

Bull Child wore a robe, <span id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_30.md) famous among
the Blackfeet, and purchased by him from "Brings-down-the-Sun," a
celebrated medicine man of the north. Many bird and animal tails were
attached, including those of the eagle, owl, weasel, mink and gopher. It
had also a small bell, two shields and several pieces of fragrant punk
from the cottonwood tree. There were paint marks on the back of the robe
to represent stars. One group of seven, across the shoulders, to
represent the

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Great Bear, and,
under the right shoulder, a cluster of six to represent the Pleiades. In
the centre of the back, the Sun was represented by a double circle in
black and red, and there was also a small Maltese cross for the Morning
Star. Before entering the Sun-lodge, Bull Child gave a long dance
outside. In one hand he held owl and crow tails, which belonged to the
medicine of his robe; and, in the other, an eagle wing that went with
his medicine bag.

painted upon his face and body had been revealed to him by the Sun in a
dream, while sleeping in the medicine booth of a former Sun-dance. The
marks upon his arms represented the rainbow, those upon his cheeks
stars. Across his mouth was a red cross, the sign of fasting. Upon the
centre of his forehead was a red disc for the Sun and upon either temple
two yellow streaks for sun dogs. Upon the front of his
otter-medicine-hat was fastened a white shell representing the sun, and
above it was painted a crescent for the Moon. At the back of the hat
were two spotted eagle feathers, and in his hair a single red eagle
plume.

When he danced, he faced first towards the rising sun, blowing his
medicine whistle and making mysterious

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

motions with both arms extended towards the sky. Then he danced facing
the west and waving the eagle wing in the direction of the setting sun.

The door of the Sun-lodge faced towards the east. Opposite the entrance
upon the inside, was a small booth for the exclusive use of the medicine
men. It was closely interwoven at the sides and back with ground-pine to
bar inquisitive eyes from the outside. The

<span id="img_31400"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![THE
SUN-LODGE.](tn/31400.jpg)

</span>

floor was made of earth taken from the foot of the Centre Pole. It was
hardened by wetting and then covered with white clay. Pine boughs were
spread within upon which they slept. When the medicine men entered the
booth they announced that they would fast four days, which meant to the
tribe that the Sun-dance would continue four days longer. During this
time the medicine men ate but four bites of dried meat before sunrise
and four more after sunset, with an

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

allowance of but one small shell of water. They might eat gooseberries
and sweet cottonwood pulp, provided they were brought to them. They
could not gather them, nor leave the booth during their fast.

The Indians surrounded and crowded into the Sun-lodge in such numbers
that it was almost impossible for more to enter, or for those that were
within to withdraw. Seats were reserved for the lodge-giver with

his wife and their assistants. Gives-to-the-Sun was indeed highly
exalted among Indian women, when she entered the Sun-lodge with Mad
Wolf, O-mis-tai-po-kah and Natokema, for she was the object of honour
and veneration from the entire tribe. Robes were spread, and they took
their seats near the Centre Pole, on the north side of the medicine
booth. The people brought offerings, which they presented with a filled
pipe to one of the medicine men. After smoking he painted the faces of
the givers and blessed them with "long life and

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

good luck." Many women carried young children to Bull Child to receive
his blessing. He took them in his arms, and, holding a bunch of eagle
feathers in one hand and a buffalo tail in the other, gazed intently at
the bright sun and prayed, that "they might be endowed with power, and
have an abundance to eat throughout their lives."

The space in the centre was kept open for the different societies. They
were recognised, as they entered, by their characteristic dress and the
painting of their bodies. Hanging their shields and weapons upon the
Centre Pole, they sat down in rows to the north and south of the fire
and later gave their different dances. Warriors also "counted coups,"
narrating their deeds of bravery and illustrating them by their sham
battles.

The Blackfeet believe that men, who have been brave in battle, have
acquired extra merit and, by recounting their deeds publicly in the
Sun-lodge will thereby help their sick relatives and friends. One of
these was Mukoi-sa-po who arose and prayed,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O Sun take pity on my sick mother and restore her
to health."</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He built a
miniature lodge of branches to make more realistic his description of
his attacking alone a Sioux lodge, and securing two scalps.

Big Beaver, dressed in a buckskin suit, decorated with weasel skins and
holding a piece of the sacred food, stood before the people saying:

"<span class="small">Hear me! my brothers and sisters. During the moon,
when snows are deep (February), I went with Esto-ko-atto to visit the
Crows. On our way home, at the time of the big Chinook (Warm Wind), we
were crossing the Yellowstone River. The water was high and carried us
against an ice-jam. Esto-ko-atto went under and was drowned, but I
crawled out upon the ice, which floated down the river. I then vowed to
the Sun that, if I escaped alive, my sister would partake of a tongue
for me at the time of the</span>

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

<span class="small">next Sun-dance. I jumped from one ice-cake to
another and escaped to shore, reaching my home in safety."</span>

He handed the tongue to his sister, who held it up, praying to the Sun
Power for all of the people. Breaking a small piece from the tongue, she
buried it in the

</span>

earth, praying to the Underground Spirits that all might have plenty to
eat. Big Beaver then said to his sister, "Here is my horse and the
clothing I wear. Give them to the medicine man, Spotted Eagle, and ask
him to pray for us."

The entire assembly became hushed, when Kit-sta-ka

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

arose from a group of squaws and, with trembling voice, sang to her dead
lover,

<span class="small">"This is the sacred place where I was last with my
lover. Now I am left alone, for he has gone to the Spirit World where I
hope to join him soon."</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> After the
Sun-dance, Kit-sta-ka was camped with the clan of Lone Eaters on Two
Medicine River. One evening she was seen standing on the edge of a high
cliff in full view of the camp. The Indians heard her singing this same
song to her dead lover, and then saw her jump to her death.

Many years ago, when the Indian tribes were at war, it was customary for
warriors, who had made vows, to fulfil them at the time of the
Sun-dance. These acts were not performed, as is sometimes asserted, for
the making of warriors, nor were they regarded as deeds of bravado, but
as religious expiations to the Sun, in return for favours granted. The
vows were made under various conditions. For instance, a man, starting
upon an important war expedition, would pray to the Sun, promising
self-torture, if he could be successful and return home safely.
Sometimes a warrior, hard pressed in battle, or a hunter in a desperate
conflict with a wild animal, vowed that, if his life were saved, he
would cut himself at the next Sun-dance. The devotee, in fulfilling such
a vow, would choose a friend to do the cutting and have charge of him
during the ordeal. Having made the incisions and thrust wooden skewers
under the muscles, on both sides of his breast, he made them fast to the
loose ends of one of the half dozen raw-hide ropes suspended from the
top of the Centre Pole. He then danced around the pole until the skewers
were torn loose. The spectators spurred him on by loud and continual
singing, shouts of encouragement and admiration,

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

and violent beating of the tom-toms. Weakened by previous fasting, he
would often fall senseless to the ground, to be revived and started
again, until his flesh was torn loose, when he would withdraw within the
tipi of a relative for healing treatment and a feast. In their frenzy
greater tortures were often voluntarily undertaken. Extra incisions
would be made in their shoulders and back, from which buffalo skulls,
guns, saddles and other heavy articles were suspended. The dancers would
run about, dragging these heavy objects after them, until torn off by
the violent strain.

Once, Two Bears, a young chief in a desperate battle with the Sioux, was
surrounded and cut off from his comrades. When death seemed certain, he
made a vow to the Sun and escaped. The next summer, he rode through the
Sun-dance camp, telling the story of his deliverance and announcing that
he was ready to fulfil his vow. He presented himself before a medicine
man, who covered his body with white clay, painted black streaks on his
cheeks, representing tears, and a black shield on his back,—the emblem
of war. A wreath of juniper was placed upon his head and sage leaves
tied around his wrists and ankles. He chose a noted warrior, who had
done great deeds in battle, to cut the incisions in his back and breast.
In these slits skewers were inserted, to which lariats were attached.
During the ordeal Two Bears displayed no sign of pain. He directed that
a herd of his own horses be sent for; that the lariats be fastened to
them, and that they be stampeded by the waving of blankets. He announced
also, that he gave these horses as an offering to the Sun. The young
chief was dragged a long distance before the last skewer was pulled
through his flesh and he lay as if dead upon the plain. He was carried
on a litter to his

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

tipi, and root medicine was applied to his wounds. Next day he returned
to the Sun-lodge, bringing a present and a filled pipe for the medicine
man, who smoked and prayed for him. It is said that those who underwent
self-torture generally seemed to recover, but not many of them lived
long afterwards, because of the severe nervous shock sustained.

The medicine men were believed to have power over the weather, and at
the time of the Sun-dance were expected to drive away all storms. The
following incident illustrates the extraordinary skill with which they
acquire and maintain a reputation with the tribe for supernatural power.

A dark cloud, with its eastern side extending far out over the plains,
was seen slowly advancing along the main range of the Rockies towards
the encampment. The people anxiously watched the medicine men, who were
quick to realise that the occasion had great possibilities of success,
or failure for their office. Spotted Eagle and Mastepene standing in
front of their people, entered into a sort of competition as
weather-makers, but with much better success than the competing prophets
of Baal. Mastepene, blowing his whistle and facing the black cloud,
called in a loud voice,

"Behold! A storm comes from the mountains, and you people would get wet,
but I am powerful and my medicine is strong. I will now dance to keep
the weather clear."

He left the booth, and stepping forth into the circle danced alone. He
was short, but sinewy, and as he danced, circling around with agile
step, he held an otter skin towards the north, south, east and west
which, with a final gesture, as if driving back the clouds, he waved
over his head. A sudden change in

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

the wind averted its course and it divided, as Mastepene predicted.
Spotted Eagle, jealous of the success of his rival, then left the booth.
He wore the powerful medicine handed down to him by Four Bears. On his
head was an otter-skin cap to make him strong and active; in his hair an
eagle feather to preserve him in battle; while around his waist was a
medicine belt to keep his body free from sickness. In one hand he

<span id="img_32100"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![A MEDICINE MAN

</span>

carried a magpie and in the other a mink skin. Standing before the
waiting people, he said,

"Mastepene, you are wrong, for my supernatural power over the weather
comes from the Sun, and is therefore stronger than yours. The storm has
indeed separated, but it will again unite and return to wet the people."

Again the eyes of the Indians eagerly watched the divided clouds, which
actually came together and

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

continued to spread until they passed over the encampment with a heavy
rain.

The Sun had set on the last day of his Sun-dance, when Mad Wolf, the
greatest orator of the Blackfeet, arose to make a farewell talk. A deep
stillness fell over the assembled people as the venerable chief, with
hand upraised to command attention, stood before them. He spoke with a
strong full voice, saying:

"Hear! my children, for I speak to you with a good heart. It does us all
good to assemble every summer around the Sun-lodge. We have smoked the
Medicine Pipe, and the rising smoke has carried away all of our bad
feelings. Many have given presents to the Sun, and some have fulfilled
their vows. The old people have fasted and prayed, and now feel better
in their hearts. The young men have listened to the wise counsels of the
chiefs, and the young girls have seen the medicine women, chosen to fast
and pray, because their lives are pure and their hearts are kindly
disposed towards everyone. The Great Sun God is our father. He is kind,
for he makes the trees to bud and the grass to become green in the
spring-time. He gave the people good hearts, that they also might be
kind and help each other. The grass is now long, and the sun is bright
and warns upon the prairies, but the cold and frost of winter, with its
deep snows and biting winds, will soon come, and I know not where our
women and children will get their food. We are not moving; we are just
standing still. The buffalo are all gone, the antelope and the rest of
the game also. The white men have continued driving us westward, until
now the Rocky Mountains face us like a wall and we can go no farther. I
care not for myself, for I will soon go to the Great Spirit. I am
anxious for the little children, for I know not what will become of
them.

"You have all heard of our Ka-ach-sino (Great Grandfather, President),
who calls us his red children. He is the only one upon whom we can
depend, and we must now look to him, as in the past we have prayed to
the Sun God. All of you my children should obey his laws and give heed
to his advice. He lives far away towards the rising sun, but I shake
hands with him now, for our hearts feel good toward him. Prepare to
return to your ranches and look well after your cattle, for, with
diligence and perseverance, you can make a good living. Let everyone
keep away from fire water, and send your children to school. If they can
learn the talk of the white men, they will be a great help to us, for
the white man's way is now on top. I shake hands with all of you, my

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

<span class="small">children. I wish that you may feel the sunshine of
joy in your hearts and that you may have no trouble. What I speak with
my mouth I feel in my heart. Farewell!"</span>

Early on the following morning, Running Crane, followed by his band,
departed for the south, and on the next day Mad Wolf also departed,
followed by the rest of the tribe. I remained alone in the midst of the
recent encampment, watching them as they slowly

<span id="img_32300"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![MAD WOLF WITH His
BAND DEPARTING FOR THE NORTH.](tn/32300.jpg)

MAD WOLF WITH His BAND DEPARTING FOR THE NORTH.  
</span>

made their way northward. When they disappeared over a distant ridge, I
turned for a last look at the Surf-lodge, which was now the one
conspicuous and solitary object in the midst of a broad and desolate
plain, surrounded on all sides by the smoking embers of the deserted
lodge fires.

Mad Wolf died, May 28, 1902, during the moon, when the grass is green.
Just before his death, four large crosses of light appeared about the
moon, the sign a great chief is about to die. He was ill but three days.
Ear Rings and White Grass, skilled

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

doctors of the Blackfeet, were called without avail. Mad Wolf grew
steadily worse. It was the second night of his illness, when Ear Rings
said, "Mad Wolf, you should make your farewell talk, for your sickness
is hard to cure and it is doubtful if you will recover." The chief would
not think of death. He directed that Snake Woman, a celebrated herb
doctor and medicine woman, be consulted, but her remedies brought no
relief. At early dawn of the fourth day, Mad Wolf suddenly raised
himself. He said, "I want to go alone into the open, that I may see the
blue sky and breathe again the fresh air."

He walked slowly to the door, and when outside, the watchers heard him
speaking. Gives-to-the-Sun, hastening to him, found him kneeling, his
face towards the rising sun, with arms outstretched and praying to the
Morning Star, which had already risen and was shining upon the face of
the dying chief. She heard him exclaim, "Wait!" and when she hurried to
his side, he said, "Do you not see, standing there, the ghost of my old
friend Double Runner? He says he is waiting for me, and it is now time
for me to go with him."

Morning Plume ran out and caught the dying chief in his arms. Mad Wolf
sank back as if tired. Reaching out, he took the hands of his wife in
his own, and looking up tried to speak. She leaned close to his face and
heard him whisper, "I love you and I love Morning Plume also." With
these last words, Mad Wolf passed to the Spirit World over the "Wolf
Trail" (Milky Way), the path worn across the heavens by the travelling
spirits of many generations of the Blackfeet dead.
