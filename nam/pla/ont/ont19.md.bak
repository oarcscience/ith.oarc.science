THE first day in the Sun-dance camp was warm and pleasant. The Indians
remained outside their tipis greeting their friends and watching for
late arrivals. All were light-hearted and glad to be assembled in the
great tribal camp. On all sides were scenes of activity, boys galloping
bareback over the hills while rounding up the horses, men picketing
their horses and driving large herds of them to the lake for water.
Women were arranging the lodges, caring for the medicine bundles and
bringing in wood and water in preparation for the evening meal.

An inseparable feature of an Indian camp is the large numbers of dogs of
all kinds. They mostly run in packs, continually brawling, or, for the
sake of excitement, racing after horsemen and riderless horses on the
hills, or even worrying a single dog that had incautiously ventured out
alone.

Little Owl's large family were seated about an outside

fire in front of his lodge, while Poi-o-pa-ta-mach-ka (Coming Running)
prepared their supper. She was young and very pretty, although the
mother of a numerous flock of children. As my lodge was close by, I had
an opportunity of observing her overburdened life. She was entertaining
visitors from the Flathead tribe in her single-roomed home. A crowd of
small children<span id="img_22600"></span>

were hanging about her, demanding attention, one of them a young baby,
and another, a little daughter, suffering from a dangerous abscess. But,
in spite of her cares and labours, she was always smiling and in a good
humour. I did not once hear her complain, or speak an angry, or
impatient word. Her bright and cheerful disposition radiated sunshine to
all around her.

Wolf Chief came from his lodge to announce that he was giving a feast.
He invited his guests by shouting each of their names several times in
succession. The simplicity of this Blackfoot custom of issuing social
invitations contrasts with the complicated forms observed in civilised
society.

Morning Eagle, a noted old warrior and the hero of many battles, led
through the camp his old white war-horse, decorated with medicine
emblems and picture writings, representing his achievements in early
days, while, in a loud voice he called the people's

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

attention to his "advertising horse," and proclaimed his deeds of
valour. Although a very old man, he was still alive during the Sun-dance
camp of 1909, when his lodge was close to mine. He was then nearly blind
and had completely lost the use of his legs, but he still

retained his old-time enthusiasm and love of excitement. He had the
young men lift him upon his war horse, that he might ride through camp
as of old and take part in the sham battles. He awakened me every
morning at sunrise (4.30), when he began to chant his medicine songs,
repeating the performance at precisely the same time each day. The songs
seemed very similar, the

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

principal variations consisting in changes of rhythm and in the
different bird, or animal calls at the end of each. During a heavy
storm, and in spite of his age

</span>

and feebleness, he crawled from the lodge on his hands and knees and
seated himself in the pouring rain, with only a blanket thrown over his
head, to pray and to chant medicine songs, for the purpose of driving
away the storm.

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

Standing before his small tipi among the North Blackfeet, was an elderly
chief named Natosin (Sun Chief). His two travois, one with a wicker
frame constructed over the seat as a protection from the weather, were
ingeniously raised together for a sun shade over the door. He was over
six feet in height and of dignified bearing. His long hair was tinged
with grey and his

face manly and earnest. He seemed pleased, when I stopped to tell him
that I had once visited his people. At that moment his wife came from
the lodge and joined in welcoming me. Natosin said, "We have come here
in fulfilment of a vow. During the past winter, when very sick, I vowed
that if my health was restored, I would attend the next Sun-dance. When
we heard the ceremonial was to be given here, we came

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

from the far north, that I might fulfil my vow and that we might partake
of the sacred food."

In another tipi I heard a woman singing softly. Looking within I saw a
little hammock, ingeniously made by folding a blanket over two buckskin
thongs, swinging from the poles. The baby slept, while its old
grandmother gently rocked the hammock, singing a lullaby, just as our
affectionate grandmothers do.

TWO WOMEN TANNING A GREEN HIDE.  
</span>

Two women were tanning a green hide, which was pegged to the ground,
hair-side down. They first fleshed it with large sharpened elk-bones,
and then scraped it with an adze-shaped tool to make it of uniform
thickness. An old woman was patiently softening a hide, which is the
last step in tanning. She pulled and worked it against a raw-hide rope,
fastened at both ends to an upright pole. When the hide became
sufficiently soft and pliable, she whitened it by rubbing with a piece
of fungus.

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

Running Fisher's wife was making parfleches (rawhide cases) near the
Otter Tipi. They were used by the Blackfeet as receptacles, and for
packs on horses while travelling.

I found greater difficulty in photographing women than men. I was at a
loss to understand the cause of my trouble, until I discovered that they
were unwilling

to have their pictures taken dressed in their ordinary clothes, as I
usually found them while pursuing their daily avocations. But they took
an entirely different view of the matter when dressed in their finery. I
was told, however, that some women believed that the machine had magical
power, and were afraid of it. This belief was started by a medicine man
who was jealous of his wife's frequent visits to a photographer's place.
But he effectually stopped them when he

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

explained to her that, by means of the camera, the white man was able to
see through her clothes.

A group of women were seated on the ground, sewing a large tipi covering
which was spread out before them. They seemed to be thoroughly enjoying
themselves,

<span id="img_23200"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![WOMEN SEWING A
TIPI COVERING.](tn/23200.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/23200.jpg.md)  
WOMEN SEWING A TIPI COVERING.  
</span>

gossiping, smoking, and eating while at their work, much after the
fashion of the neighbourly quilting bees of our grandmothers. The tipi
coverings were so large and heavy that it would have been impossible for
one woman to do the work alone. Joint labour was a necessity, at the
same time furnishing a means of social enjoyment. When the group had
finished one tipi they

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

moved on to help another woman, who was waiting for their assistance on
her tipi covering.

Not only the manufacture, but also the keep—the "pitching" and
"striking" of the tipi, was the office of women. They became so expert
in both, that either was the work of only a few minutes. In former days,
when buffaloes were numerous, the Blackfeet made

TIPI.&lt;br&gt; (Lifting the covering into place.)](tn/23300.jpg)

their tipis of buffalo skins. They now use canvas, or duck. The skins
were tanned white but, in use, became smoke-coloured in the upper part
of the tipi. When a lodge covering was discarded, it was cut up for
moccasins, because they would not harden or shrink.

It required eight buffalo skins to make a small lodge, and from twenty
to thirty to make a very large one. The average size was about sixteen
feet in diameter

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

at the base, while large ones measured twenty-five feet. From fourteen
to twenty-six poles were used for the supporting framework, and two
others as "ear-poles" for facilitating the escape of smoke. The best
poles are made of the slim and straight mountain pines, which the women
cut and peel and season slowly, to keep them straight. Their length
varies from fifteen to thirty feet according to the size of the tipi. A
good set of poles having been secured, it is carried everywhere in their
wanderings.

The following method of pitching a tipi was taught me by the Blackfeet.
Four poles of equal length were selected. Lashing them together near
their tops with a strong cord, we stood them up like a tripod and spread
out their butts on the ground, very much on the same principle as the
stacking of arms, with fixed bayonets, by infantry. This made a firm
basis or skeleton for the completed framework. The other poles were then
placed around, equi-distant from each other, their tops falling into the
forked seat, made by the crossed tops of the four poles first put into
place. Then, spreading the canvas covering upon the ground, we tied a
pole to its middle and raised it to its proper position against the
standing poles. The covering was then drawn around the framework of
poles and the two ends were pinned together above the door opening in
front, with seven slender sticks, or keys. By spreading out the poles
uniformly at the base, the tipi was made symmetrical and by pegging the
canvas down tightly all around, it was made to fit snugly. Last of all
the two "ear-poles" were put in position, suited to the direction of the
wind, and regulating the draught of the smoke-hole at the top. Inside,
the fire-place occupied the centre, being made of stones, to confine

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

the fire in a small circle. Around it were placed the beds, provisions
and cooking utensils. There was keen rivalry among the women in the
matter of pitching the first new tipi in the spring, also as to who
would excel in having the neatest tipi and the best tanned robes and
skins.

Although it was customary for Indian women to

</span>

perform the menial work, while men filled the more exalted vocation of
providing and defending, yet it is a mistake to conclude that Blackfeet
women rebelled against their lot. A Blackfoot mother conscientiously
trained her daughter from childhood in the tanning of hides and
converting them into clothes and shelter, the making of lodges and
travois, and in the knowledge of herbs and wild vegetables used for
eating and healing.

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Women considered
that this work was their rightful vocation and allowed no interference
from the men of the family. In fact as the men lacked the necessary
training they naturally were unfitted for these tasks.

The superiority of women in all household arts, which was developed by
careful training from childhood, was

</span>

a marked feature of their social life. The same idea is suggested in a
very primitive and curious Blackfeet legend, which tells of a period
before the institution of the family, when men and women lived in
separate camps. It describes the clothes and lodges of the men as poor
compared with those used by the women, and

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

alludes to the great benefits resulting to the men, after the women
chose them as mates.

In front of the war-tipi several women were engaged in drying and
smoking meat upon poles erected for the purpose. From the time, when the
men killed the game, the cutting of the meat, packing it on horses into
camp, curing it, and finally cooking it, all was the work

<span id="img_23700"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![WOMEN DRYING AND
SMOKING MEAT UPON POLES.](tn/23700.jpg)

of women. The preparing of pemmican, the Blackfeet's "staff of life," a
palatable form of condensed food, which was used for long journeys and
for winter supplies, was also their duty. Their method of preparing it
consisted, first, of cutting the meat into strips and drying it in the
sun. It was then well pounded in a mixture together with wild cherries.
To this was added

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

shredded meat, forming a kind of mince-meat, which was again dried and
stored in parfleches for future use.

The Blackfeet subsisted mainly upon buffalo meat, when it could be
secured. They also used sarvis berries, wild cherries, buffalo berries
and vegetables such as camass, wild turnips, wild onions, wild potatoes,
bitter root and wild rhubarb. They secured wild ducks and geese by
striking them over the head with long sticks. Beaver tails were
considered a great delicacy. They

snared rabbits with willow sticks and fish with horse-hairs, but did not
often eat them, because they preferred meat, which was abundant. They
ridiculed the custom of eating dogs practised by the Crees, Gros Ventres
and Assinniboines. The Cree Indians were not particular as to their diet
for they are said to have eaten skunks, badgers, prairie dogs and even
wolves and coyotes.

I once had an opportunity to witness the preparation of a dog feast by a
band of Assinniboines, who were visiting in a Blackfeet camp. It
happened that my

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

lodge was next to Eagle Child's, who was the owner of a litter of fat
puppies. He had erected close by, a small tipi where they slept, and
they played daily before my door. One night the puppies suddenly
disappeared, Eagle Child himself could not explain what had become of
them. The mystery, however, was solved when I went to call upon the
Assinniboines. I saw that some of

my puppy neighbours had already been cut up and were boiling in a large
pot, while others lay in the hot ashes to have the hair singed off.
Nothing was wasted. Near by was a collection of small legs and feet
which were to be used for soup and was afterwards described in jest by
my Blackfeet friends as "the puppy paw soup of the Assinniboines."
