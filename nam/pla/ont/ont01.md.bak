### PREFACE

AFTER becoming acquainted with the Blackfeet Indians, I realised that
there were locked up in the breasts of the old chiefs and medicine men
rich treasures of folk-lore, religious beliefs and ceremonials. I saw
that the younger generation was indifferent to their tribal customs,
traditions and religion. I also observed that they had no written
language, and it seemed inevitable that, with the passing of the old
chiefs and medicine men, their ancient religion and folk-lore would fall
into oblivion. When I discovered that I could obtain the unbosoming of
their secrets and that the door was open to me for study and
investigation, I resolved that I would do my best to preserve all the
knowledge available.

Having kept accurate records of my experiences and investigations, I
have been encouraged to believe that information has been secured worthy
of publication. This book has accordingly been published with the hope
that its narrative of experiences among the Blackfeet would interest the
general reader, and its records of investigation would be of some value
to the science of ethnology. The narrative form has been chosen in the
belief that this method would furnish a more faithful portraiture of the
environment, family life and personal character of this tribe of
Indians, and would enable the reader to form a better conception of
their religion,

tribal customs and social organisation, than if a more formal treatise
on these subjects had been attempted.

den Steinen, President of the Berlin Anthropological Society; Mr. George
A. Macmillan of London; Doctor J. G. Frazer, Fellow of Trinity College,
Cambridge, England; and Professor William Ridgeway, President of the
