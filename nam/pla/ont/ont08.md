SIKSIKAKOAN and I returned from the mountains in good time to keep my
appointment with Mad Wolf. Early in the morning of the first day of the
full moon, when the leaves were falling, I rode across the plains in
search of his summer camp on the South Fork of Cutbank River. When I
reached a high ridge overlooking the river valley, I looked down upon a
serene and beautiful landscape. In a meadow near the river was a cluster
of white lodges. To the west of the encampment, like a massive wall,
extending into the distant north and disappearing in the far south, was
the main range of the Rocky Mountains. Over the highest summits floated
light, fleecy clouds, the beautiful snow-capped peaks of Rising Wolf and
Going-to-the Sun standing sharp and clear against the deep blue sky.

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Far away over the
plains in the east and enveloped in a bluish haze, were the Kato-yi-six
(Sweet Pine Hills), <span id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_12) resembling
distant islands in the ocean. The smoke of many fires was rising from
the lodges, bearing the sweet odour of burning cottonwood. Grazing
horses dotted the green hillsides, and I met Indian boys riding
bare-back and racing their ponies. Groups of Indians in brightly
coloured clothing were variously occupied among the irregular rows of
tipis. When I rode nearer I recognised the large painted-tipi of Chief
Mad Wolf in the centre of the camp.

Clustered around Mad Wolf's were the lodges of O-mis-tai-po-kah, the
head chief, Isso-ko-yi-kinni, White Grass, Ear Rings, Medicine Wolf,
Bear Child, Drags-his-robe, Double Runner and Elk Chief. The sound of my
approach brought forth Mad Wolf's daughter Strikes-on-both-sides. She
looked very picturesque in a buckskin dress heavily beaded and a robe of
soft-tanned fawn skin with beaded stripes. She wore small white shells
in her ears and necklaces of elk teeth and deer bones. Her leggings and
moccasins were beautifully decorated with coloured porcupine quills. She
called to those within, that A-poi-a-kinni (Light Hair) had come back
and laughingly said to me, "I see that you are still smiling." She took
my hand and led me inside the lodge. At the back sat Mad Wolf. To his
left were the priests-O-mis-tai-po-kah, the head chief, White Grass, a
judge and medicine man, Isso-ko-yi-kinni, Stock-stchi, Medicine Wolf,
Elk Chief, Bear Child, Ear Rings, and. Double Runner. To the right were
Gives-to-the-Sun, wife of Mad Wolf, and Natokema, wife of
O-mis-tai-po-kah, and other women.

Turning to the head chief, Mad Wolf said: "Because

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

you are my friend, I request that you select a suitable name for my
white son." O-mis-tai-po-kah bowed his head in silence.

Maka, near whom I sat, was an Indian of unusual appearance. He was
thick-set and short in stature, with an enormous head, his heavy growth
of hair resembling the mane of a lion. He was, however, full of drollery
and good nature. There was something upon his mind, for frequently he
looked at me, with eyes dancing with merriment, and he occasionally
shook with laughter. He kept his joke to himself with difficulty, for
several times he was on the point of telling, but changed his mind, when
he looked at stern Mad Wolf. Finally he said to me in a. low voice, "I
have a name which I will give you later." But this little episode did
not escape Mad Wolf's keen ears and he turned upon him quickly, with
such a piercing and reproving glance, that nothing further was heard of
Maka's joke.

#### CEREMONIAL OF THE BEAVER MEDICINE.

Bear Child arose and with a forked stick, covered with sacred paint,
selected a live coal from the fire and placed it in front of Mad Wolf.
He took dried sweet grass from a small buckskin bag and, holding it
aloft to command attention, and as a signal that he was ready to begin
the ceremonial, placed it upon the hot coal. When the rising smoke
filled the lodge with a pleasing fragrance, Mad Wolf began with seven
songs, which were chanted in unison, each song being repeated four
times. The first was to Napi (Sun Power, not referring to Old Man).

Mad Wolf led the chants with strong voice, swaying

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

his body to and fro and marking time with raised finger, explaining to
me that the Beaver Chief made this sign when giving instruction to
Akaiyan, the founder of the Beaver Medicine.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">1. "Behold Napi comes into the lodge.  
    He is a strong Medicine Man.  
    He came in.  
    I see him."</span>

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

2\. "The Heavens provide us with food.  
    The Heavens are glad to behold us."

3\. "The Earth loves us.  
    The Earth is glad to hear us sing.  
    The Earth provides us with food."

</div>

Mad Wolf ended this song with the gesture of sweeping his hands towards
the ground.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">4. Song to the "Prongs." (The prongs are sacred
sticks painted red. They are forked, and are</span>

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">used to take hot coals from the fire in the burning
of incense.)</span>

</div>

Mad Wolf, O-mis-tai-po-kah and their wives, as the principals in the
ceremonial, knelt beside the Bundle, and chanted in unison, while laying
their hands upon the "prongs" held in the sweet smoke. Each in turn held
a prong against his shoulder, in imitation of beavers carrying sticks,
while at work building their

lodge, and then, extending their arms together, with hands raised and
parallel (the sign of the beaver lodge), they prayed together to the
spirit of the beaver,

<span class="small">"Pity us! Grant us your wisdom and cunning that we
may escape all dangers. May our medicine provide us with food. May all
of us be blessed."</span>

5\. Two Beaver Songs.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The Old Man, (Beaver Chief), is coming in.  
 The Old Man has come in. <span id="page_81">p. 81</span>  
 He sits down beside his medicine.  
 It is a very strong medicine."

"The Old Woman (Female Beaver) is coming in.  
 The Old Woman has come in.  
 She sits down and takes the medicine.  
 It is a very strong medicine."

</div>

6\. Buffalo Song.

During this chant Mad Wolf and O-mis-tai-po-kah with their wives knelt
by the side of the sacred

<span id="img_08100"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![MAKING THE SIGN OF
THE BEAVER LODGE.](tn/08100.jpg)

</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bundle and with
deep reverence slowly lifted it, singing the following in unison:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I take hold of the sacred Buffalo.  
 While I am walking, I walk slowly.  
 I stop with my medicine.  
 The ground where my medicine rests is sacred."</span>

</div>

7\. The seventh and last chant was a Buffalo song.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When summer comes, He will come down from the
Mountains."</span>

</div>

Mad Wolf directed his wife to bring forth the Koto-ki-a-nukko (buffalo
raw hides),

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

and turning to me explained that, during the ceremony which would
follow, the priests would beat time on these hides with the rattles, in
imitation of the way the beavers drummed by striking the water with
their tails. Mad Wolf first chanted and then prayed over the buffalo

<span id="img_08200"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![BRINGING OUT
BUFFALO RAW HIDE.](tn/08200.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/08200.jpg)

</span>

hides with closed eyes, holding his right hand raised impressively with
fingers closed and thumb pointing upwards, a sign used by the Beaver
Chief. After the hides had been unrolled all chanted in unison,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The Buffalo likes to live in the mountains during
the autumn.  
 He comes down from the mountains to the plains.  
 The mountains are his medicine."</span>

</div>

During this chant, Mad Wolf, O-mis-tai-po-kah and

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

their wives held up their hands with the two index fingers curved
towards each other (the others closed) in imitation of buffalo horns,
the sign of the buffalo. The hides were spread on the ground in front of
the priests during the chant:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The Buffalo came down from the mountains.  
 He lies down upon the ground."</span>

</div>

Gives-to-the-Sun handed Mad Wolf an old medicine

<span id="img_08300"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![MAKING BUFFALO

</span>

sack containing rattles. They were made by stretching raw hide over
wicker frames, in shape like gourds, enclosing pebbles and having short
handles. While the two women, Gives-to-the-Sun and Natokema, knelt
beside the sacred Bundle and raised it reverently, Mad Wolf took the
rattles from the medicine sack. He distributed them among the
Awa-wa-nukki (singers or priests) and, handing two to me, said: "You are
now

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

my son and it is proper for you to join with us in this ceremonial." He
then chanted the two Crow songs:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. "I fly high in the air.  
    My medicine (power) is very strong.  
    The wind is my medicine."

2\. "The Buffalo is my medicine.  
    He is a very strong medicine.  
         The trees are my medicine.  
    When I am among them I walk around my own medicine."

</div>

<span id="img_08400"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![TAKING RATTLES
FROM MEDICINE SACK.](tn/08400.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/08400.jpg)  
TAKING RATTLES FROM MEDICINE SACK.  
</span>

The Rattle songs came next, all uniting in the song, "The rattles I hold
are good." This was repeated four times. The priests then grasped the
rattles and beat rhythmically upon the buffalo raw hide, singing in
unison "I now take the rattles." I watched every movement Mad Wolf made
and when he grasped the rattles and began beating, I did likewise and
also joined vigorously

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

in the chant. He had been watching my movements for, at the end of the
song, he said, "I like the way you swing your rattles, I feel proud of
my white son."

At this moment, a visiting chief from the Bloods raised his voice in
prayer, saying,

<span class="small">"Great Spirit in the Sun! I am praying for my people
that they may be able to have food and survive the coming winter. May
all</span>

<span id="img_08500"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![MAKING THE
ANTELOPE SIGN.&lt;br&gt; (Imitating with their hands the movement of

(Imitating with their hands the movement of antelope running.)  
</span>

<span class="small">of our children grow and have strong bodies. May
they live long and be happy."</span>

During this prayer, Mad Wolf and the entire assembly reverently bowed
their heads, joining in an ejaculatory assent (Amen) when he had
finished.

Mad Wolf started the Elk song, while the two women, Gives-to-the-Sun and
Natokema. imitated the actions of elk rubbing their horns against trees.

In the Moose song four men came forth imitating, with their heads, the
movements of moose rubbing their horns.

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

For the Antelope song Mad Wolf, O-mis-tai-po-kah and their wives chanted
while making the antelope sign. Holding their hands closed, one above
the other, they changed positions alternately with a quick graceful
movement, in imitation of antelope running.

The songs were, at this point, interrupted by the wife of the Blood
chief making a long prayer for her own tribe and for the people among
whom she was visiting.

Mad Wolf now brought forth the sacred Pipe wrapped in red flannel.
Before starting, he explained to me that the ceremonial of the Pipe
included two Pipe songs and three Pipe Dancing songs. They chanted the
first two, while unrolling the Pipe, one while untying the strings, and
one while removing the cover. Mad Wolf, while seated, led the first Pipe
song, chanting the words,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Our father, the Sun! It is now time you were
rising.  
 I want to dance with you."</span>

</div>

Mad Wolf then arose and, drawing his blanket around him, held the Pipe
in its red cover, while the entire assembly united in chanting the first
Pipe Dancing song. Mad Wolf danced, blowing his medicine whistle and
circling the fire in the same direction the sun moves through the
heavens. O-mis-tai-po-kah took the Pipe for the second Dancing song, and
White Grass, the medicine-man, for the third, turning from right to left
as he danced around the fire. While Mad Wolf unrolled the Pipe he gave
the cry of the beaver and imitated the actions of a swimming beaver.
O-mis-tai-po-kah arose and, blowing his medicine whistle, danced around
the fire with a slow, graceful step. Taking the Pipe from Mad Wolf, he
held it before him, while the priests sang and heat vigorously with
their rattles.

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

O-mis-tai-po-kah then danced, holding the Pipe beneath his blanket and
finished by returning it to Mad Wolf, who held it up towards the north,
south, east and west. Finally, placing it in the sweet smoke of the
incense, he bowed his head and prayed to the Great Spirit in

<span id="img_08700"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![“HOLDING THE PIPE
IN THE SWEET SMOKE,&lt;br&gt; MAD WOLF BOWED HIS HEAD AND
PRAYED&lt;br&gt; TO THE SUN.”](tn/08700.jpg)

“HOLDING THE PIPE IN THE SWEET SMOKE,

</span>

the Sun for the recovery of the sick. The Root Digger was then taken
from the Bundle with the chant,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I am digging the sacred Turnip."</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The two women
Gives-to-the-Sun and Natokema placed their hands upon it and prayed,
holding it in position for digging.

The ordinary root-digger is a wooden stick, about two feet long, with a
sharpened point, in common use by Indian women for digging roots. The
sacred Root Digger is similar, but is painted with red paint and figures
prominently in the sacred Bundles of the Sun-dance

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

and Beaver Medicine. The Blackfeet believe that, according to their
tradition, it was originally brought to them by the Indian maiden, who
was loved by Morning Star, and was taken by him to live in the home of
the Sun. She was compelled by the Sun God to return to earth and her
tribe, because of her disobedience to his commands, in digging up the
sacred Turnip, and in gazing down at her people on the earth through the
hole she had made in the sky.

The sacred women, Gives-to-the-Sun and Natokema, seated beside the
Beaver Bundle, were distinguished from the other women by the colour of
their blankets, which were decorated with red paint. They had both made
the vow for the Sun-dance, and were held in high honour by the Indians.
To be eligible as sacred women they were required to have led perfectly
pure lives before the entire tribe, and they must also be known for
their kindness of heart towards everyone.

The time had now come for the opening of the Beaver Bundle. The priests
sang a lively chant called the "Song of the Buffalo Bull":

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The head chief is looking for something to hook
that may help him."</span>

</div>

The two sacred women knelt beside the Bundle, imitating the actions of
the buffalo and representing the buffalo bull, or chief, slowly
approaching the Beaver Bundle. He stopped three times before reaching
it. At the fourth time, the women imitated the Buffalo Chief, hooking at
the Bundle with his horns. Mad Wolf chanted the Hurrying song and then
the String song, as the women untied the strings and removed the outside
cover, revealing a beautiful beaver skin called in their ceremonial "His
Robe." The song was changed to a solemn chant led by Mad Wolf, while

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

the sacred women slowly unrolled the beaver skin, uncovering the many
skins of the birds and animals from the plains and mountains.

It is difficult for one of the white race to realise the deep solemnity
with which the Indians opened the sacred Bundle. To them it was a moment
of deepest reverence and religious feeling.

<span id="img_08900"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![OPENING THE BEAVER
BUNDLE.](tn/08900.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/08900.jpg)  
OPENING THE BEAVER BUNDLE.  
</span>

Mad Wolf, taking the beaver skin reverently held it up while chanting:

<span class="small">"My medicine (Beaver) says, 'when I go out from the
lodge and see an enemy, I dive down into the water where no one can harm
me. '"</span>

He then moved the beaver skin in imitation of the animal's movements
while swimming, and suddenly blew shrilly upon the medicine whistle, to
represent the Beaver's alarm when seeing an enemy and diving out of
sight. Mad Wolf and the priests joined in a Beaver song accompanied by
the beating of rattles. The sacred

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

women knelt by the side of the Bundle, making mysterious motions with
their hands, in imitation of the Beaver swimming and working and
building his lodge, gracefully swaying their bodies in time with the
rhythmical beating. Each in turn took the Beaver

<span id="img_09000"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![WOMEN PRAYING

</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Skin and with
bowed head reverently held it to her breast, praying to the spirit of
the Beaver:

<span class="small">"I take you, my child, in order that my children and
relatives may be free from sickness."</span>

Two women arose and knelt with Gives-to-the-Sun and Natokema in front of
the Medicine Bundle. The four women together imitated a beaver's
movements. They covered their heads with blankets to represent the
beaver hidden in his lodge, all the time moving their bodies in time
with the chanting of the

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

priests and the rhythmical beating. Then they came forth to work on
their beaver-dams, the women representing beavers rising to the surface
by uncovering their heads, and holding sticks in their mouths like
beavers carrying branches, imitating also the swimming motions with
their hands. Suddenly the beavers dived under the water, and at this
point Mad Wolf slowly lifted the sacred Beaver Skin, while the four
dancers

<span id="img_09100"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![WOMEN PRAYING
WHILE HOLDING BEAVER SKIN.](tn/09100.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/09100.jpg)  
WOMEN PRAYING WHILE HOLDING BEAVER SKIN.  
</span>

continued their mysterious and symbolic movements. Then the dancers
imitated the beavers coming to the surface and swimming across the
river. They went out for a dance upon the shore, sitting upright, wiping
their faces with their hands, and looking carefully in all directions
after the manner of beavers guarding against danger. The four women
arose and stood in single file, with Gives-to-the-Sun at the head of the
line as the wife of the Beaver Chief. They danced around the fire with
their hands crossed upon their breasts, turning to

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

and fro and swaying their bodies in time with the chanting of the
priests. Mad Wolf handed the Beaver Skin to Gives-to-the-Sun. The
singing and drumming became louder as the women circled the fire,
imitating the call of the beaver. Gives-to-the-Sun held the Beaver Skin
beneath her robe making it appear to swim around her waist and then
around her neck. After dancing once around the fire, she handed the
Beaver Skin to the woman next in line, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I do not give you away, my child (the beaver),
because I am tired of you, but because the son of this woman is sick and
she prays that he might be restored to health."</span>

</div>

The woman, receiving the sacred skin, was careful not to let it fall,
lest it bring misfortune, and prayed,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I take you, my child (the beaver) that my husband
and children might be free from sickness and that they may live to be
old."</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> She danced once
around the fire with the skin across her shoulders. This part was
continued, until each one of the four women had taken the Beaver Skin in
turn.

Gives-to-the-Sun and Natokema held up two snow-white winter skins of the
weasel. They prayed to the spirit of this animal for its skill in
hunting, and providing food. The priests chanted the Weasel song, while
Mad Wolf, taking one of the skins, held it to his breast, praying for a
blessing and then, rising, danced around the fire, blowing at intervals
upon his medicine whistle to represent the weasel's cry and imitating
its movements when hunting for food. O-mis-tai-po-kah, the head chief,
with a gesture of authority, held the snow white skin aloft, so that all
within the lodge could see. There was a deep silence as he looked
fixedly at me, saying impressively,

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

<span class="small">"This is the skin of the A-pe-ech-eken (White Weasel
Moccasin), one of the animals belonging to the Beaver Bundle. After this
sacred animal we now name you. We think you resemble this animal because
your hair is light and your eyes are blue. We pray that this name may
bring to you long life and good fortune."</span>

Mad Wolf, having expressed his approval of the name, moved to the left,
White Grass, the medicine man, taking the leader's seat. The face of
White Grass was painted a dark red. Upon the centre of his forehead

<span id="img_09300"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![WOMEN PRAYING
WHILE HOLDING TWO WHITE-WEASEL SKINS.](tn/09300.jpg)

</span>

a black spot represented a thunderbolt, from which extended on both
sides yellow zig-zags of lightning. He prayed:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Great Spirit, bless us all, men, women, and
children.  
 Sacred Medicine Bundle, help us to live a straight life.  
 Sacred Medicine Pipe, bless us, also the rivers, mountains, prairies,
animals, and birds.  
 Mother Earth, provide for us until we die."</span>

</div>

After the prayer, White Grass brought forth the sacred red paint, which
he kneaded with his hands, his

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

body meanwhile swaying to and fro. First he painted Mad Wolf and then
O-mis-tai-po-kah; in like manner the priests, Isso-ko-yi-kinni,
Stock-stchi, Bear Child and Ear Rings. I was seated next to Ear Rings
and when my turn came, Mad Wolf said, "Here comes my white son." White
Grass then signed to me to approach. Going before him, I knelt while he
placed the sacred

<span id="img_09400"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![PREPARING THE
SACRED RED PAINT.](tn/09400.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/09400.jpg)  
PREPARING THE SACRED RED PAINT.  
</span>

paint upon my forehead, chin and hands, the places where the beaver rubs
himself with his paws. A beaver song was started by Mad Wolf and
O-mis-tai-po-kah, in which all joined, accompanied by the beating of
rattles.

After the song, White Grass, addressing me, said impressively,

<span class="small">"This lodge is a sacred place, and the ceremonial,
in which we</span>

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

<span class="small">have painted you, is also sacred. We pray that you
may never be sick."</span>

White Grass then pointed along the ground towards my seat, a sign that
he had finished. Bear Child arose and taking the prongs, picked out a
live coal from the embers and laid it in front of O-mis-tai-po-kah, the
head chief. Placing dried sweet grass upon the coal and holding both
hands in the rising smoke, he prayed:—

<span class="small">"My father, Great Sun Chief, who gives us light,
look down in favour upon this young man whom we have taken into our
tribe. Grant that his relatives and all his friends may have a good
life. Protect him day and night from all harm, that he may live long,
and return many summers to visit his Indian brothers."</span>

The formal act of naming his white son and making him a member of the
tribe having been completed, Mad Wolf returned to his seat beside the
sacred Bundle to continue the ceremonial.

It required a wonderful feat of memory to conduct accurately the Beaver
ceremonial, with its great number of songs, prayers, and dances,
continuing from early morning until after sunset. Every song, prayer and
dance must be performed correctly. If any mistakes are made, it is
believed that misfortune will surely follow. One instance of the care
taken to perform accurately every detail of the ceremonial occurred in
the "Dance of the Lynx." Mad Wolf brought from the Bundle the decorated
tail of a lynx. It was handed to O-mis-tai-po-kah, who held it aloft
while all sang, accompanied by the beating of rattles. Gives-to-the Sun
stood a stick, painted red, upon the ground to represent a tree.
Natokema took the tail and imitated the movements of a lynx hunting
squirrels. First, it walked around and then sat down, looking up at the
tree. Several times it ran towards the tree, as if in

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

pursuit of a squirrel, but each time it returned and sat down. Finally,
it made a quick dash for the tree, when Natokema carried the tail
rapidly up one side and down the other. At this point, O-mis-tai-po-kah
raised his hand and stopped the service. The medicine women were
astonished. Everyone in the lodge was silent. The chief announced that
the ceremonial had not been conducted correctly. The rhythmic drumming
and singing began again, as the old chief took the tail. He represented
the lynx as making several feints, and then ran suddenly to the tree,
just as the women had done. But O-mis-tai-po-kah made it climb more
slowly and held it for some time on top, where it had a dance, keeping
time with the singing. He then brought it slowly down the other side,
clambering little by little as a lynx would do, pausing frequently to
look around and listen, making sure that all was well. It finally
reached the ground, and, scampering away, was returned to the medicine
bundle.

Mad Wolf brought forth two badger skins, taking them out backwards like
badgers emerging from their holes. He then imitated the timid actions of
the badger, which is naturally a great coward. He moved the skins this
way and that, like a badger trying to get away. Suddenly he turned the
skins around as if the badger was about to attack but instead it became
frightened and ran back into its hole.

During the song of the Wild Goose, Mad Wolf stopped for an instant and,
bowing his head, closed his eyes. The entire assembly waited "in
complete silence. Suddenly Mad Wolf looked directly at me, saying,
"There is my son, A-pe-ech-eken. I must ask him to continue the ceremony
in my place." This was intended as a humorous diversion. The Indians
enjoyed the unusual

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

occurrence. The silence was thus relieved, and Mad Wolf soon continued
the service.

The head of a mallard duck was next taken out. Mad Wolf started a chant,
in which both men and women joined, accompanied by the rattles. Elk
Chief arose and drawing his blanket around him, circled around the
lodge, imitating the movements of a duck. From across the lodge Soft
Woman arose. Both danced towards each other until they met and together
circled the fire, their movements representing the swimming and flying
of a duck. Soft Woman held up her right hand, swaying her body from one
side to the other, while Elk Chief spread out both his arms with hands
extended in imitation of a duck flying. This dance was very interesting
because of the graceful movements and steps of the two performers.

A woman entered the lodge. Her dishevelled hair hid her face and her
blanket was closely drawn around her. She looked pale and emaciated,
from fasting and her arms were bleeding, having been slashed with a
knife. One of her children had died and she was in mourning. She was
indeed a sad and forlorn-looking creature. She remained standing before
the assembled company until Mad Wolf took a handful of sage and purified
her, praying, that she might begin a new and happier life. She then
withdrew as silently as she had come.

Four Otter songs were sung and then the Mink song. After these were the
following Women songs, Prairie Dog, Lizard, Sitting and Tobacco. It was
now time to fill the sacred Pipe. Mad Wolf held the pipe bowl close to
the tobacco. He slowly picked up the stone used as a stopper and placed
it in the bowl, leading a chant in which all joined:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The Sun beholds the smoke grow larger and
larger."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

Picking up the pipe and tobacco he said,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The heavens provide us with seeds of the
tobacco."</span>

</div>

Holding the tobacco up, he chanted,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I drop the seeds as I go along."</span>

</div>

He filled the pipe and prayed,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The place where I sit is sacred."</span>

</div>

Then, holding up the pipe with the bowl pointed towards himself, he
chanted:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Sacred Person! behold I am still alive.  
 I ask the spirit of the wild geese to smoke with me,  
 The first that came into this country."

"I know of no medicine so strong as my smoke."

</div>

While going through this ceremonial with the pipe, the bowl became loose
and fearing that it might fall, which would be an ill omen, Mad Wolf
removed it. He held up the stem and placing his right hand upon his
breast gazed intently at the sun and chanted:

<span class="small">"Sacred Spirit in the Sun, it has been a long time
since you have smoked with me."</span>

He arose and danced, holding up the sacred Pipe and blowing upon his
medicine whistle. Stock-stchi followed and the women also joined, all
dancing in single file around the fire, following the direction of the
sun's course through the heavens. After the dance was finished Mad Wolf
remarked that his Pipe was very old, having been handed down through
many generations.

When he came to the skin of the red headed woodpecker, Mad Wolf said it
had three songs. In the beginning, when the birds gave their songs to
the Beaver Medicine, the woodpecker offered three. Mad Wolf chanted the
songs, holding the skin of the woodpecker in his right hand and beating
time with the

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

rattles with his left. In closing, he held both the skin and rattles
over his head and gave the call of the woodpecker.

For the Buffalo dance, Gives-to-the-Sun and Natokema arose, wearing head
dresses having horns, in imitation of buffalo cows. Mad Wolf handed to
Gives-to-the-Sun a string of buffalo horns which had been added to the
Beaver Bundle as the symbol of the buffalo by the chief, who secured the
Buffalo Tipi from the Sacred Buffalo Bull. The Indians found both
interest and amusement in this dance, because it represented the mating
of buffalo by women choosing their men. Gives-to-the-Sun and Natokema
knelt before the Beaver Bundle with heads lowered, making motions of
hooking the ground in imitation of buffalo cows digging wallows in the
autumn. They pawed the ground and bellowed, simulating buffalo throwing
dirt and catching it upon their backs, then shaking themselves and
making the dust rise into the air.

Gives-to-the-Sun and Natokema then danced, imitating the capers of
mating buffaloes. They stood before their mates pawing the ground and
hooking at them with their horns. Mad Wolf and O-mis-tai-po-kah then
joined in the dance. The men followed the women around the fire like
buffalo bulls following cows. They danced in pairs until
Gives-to-the-Sun threw the hoofs to Snake Woman. All then sat down and,
amid laughter, Snake Woman danced in front of Medicine Wolf, her
relative. When Medicine Wolf arose and joined her, she threw the hoofs
to Strikes-on-both-sides, who came gracefully across the lodge and
danced before me. While my Indian sister stood there, dancing with
quick, short steps and swaying her body in time with the singing and the
beating of rattles, I

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

heard them calling, "Get up! A-pe-ech-eken you are a chief now and
should enter the dance." Grasping the string of buffalo hoofs lying
before me I danced, following Strikes-on-both-sides around the fire,
swaying my body, turning, holding my feet together and bending at the
knees. I heard many shrill war cries from both men and women and
exclamations of "Good boy, A-pe-ech-eken!" I stopped at intervals to
mimic the call of the buffalo and to imitate its movements, digging
wallows, kicking, hooking, pawing the ground and throwing dust. When
Strikes-on-both-sides brought our dance to a close I completed the
circle and throwing the hoofs to Bear Child's wife, sat down.

Last of all came the Dog dance. Its lively air and fast time made it the
most popular of the Beaver Medicine dances. It is a woman's dance, in
which all the women within the lodge are expected to join, the men
urging them on, singing their loudest and beating time with the rattles.
The women entered into the Dog dance with spirit and dash, laughing
merrily and joking with each other.

The wife of Stock-stchi, who was not dancing, sat with her little
daughter of about twelve years, both intently watching. The dance was
just at its height and the little girl's eyes were sparkling with
excitement, when her mother, snatching off her own blanket, threw it
over the shoulders of the little girl and pushed her into the circle.
She looked very pretty with her shining black hair falling over her
shoulders, in striking contrast with the brilliant scarlet of her squaw
dress, which was beautifully fringed and decorated with beads. Her
leggings were also beaded, and around her waist was a miniature squaw
belt, closely studded with shining brass-headed tacks. At first she was
abashed and

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

cast her eyes demurely downward, but soon forgot herself and entered
into the dance with animation, her lithe body swaying to and fro, and
her small moccasined feet keeping perfect time to the beating of the
rattles. As the singers gradually quickened the time, the steps of the
dancers grew faster and faster, until they were tired out and ceased,
saying they could

CEREMONIAL ALL PARTOOK OF A FEAST.”](tn/10100.jpg)

dance no longer. When the dance was at its height, I noticed two old
white-haired women having a dance of their own outside the lodge. They
were in mourning and so could not enter the main dance, but they could
not resist the call of the lively Dog dance. They were surrounded by a
circle of young people, who were urging them on and seemed more
interested in their performance than in the main dance.

The sun had already set and the Indians began

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

preparations for returning to their lodges, bringing in the horses,
changing their beautifully decorated clothes and beaded dance moccasins
for those of everyday use. But, before they separated, all partook of a
feast of sarvis berry stew. It had a delicate, sweet flavour and was a
very popular dish. The men were always served first. I noticed, however,
that but few of them ate their share. Many children were brought to the
ceremonials and the food generally ran short. There was a custom that
any man, feeling generously inclined, would call out the name of a
woman. His plate with the remaining food was passed to her. If she had
children she always shared it with them. Amid a general calling of names
by the men and changing of plates, I requested that mine be passed to
Morning Plume's wife, who had many mouths to feed. It was eagerly
seized, divided into several portions and rapidly disappeared.

While the rest were feasting, I saw Awunna, a kindhearted old priest and
doctor, gathering together a supply of food. Before tasting anything
himself, he carried it to his wife, E-kit-o-waki, one of the old women
who had been dancing outside the lodge. They were an interesting couple.
He always seemed thoughtful of others and in a good humour, while
E-kit-o-waki, his wife, was still full of fun and life. Before the
ceremonial began I saw Awunna draw her to one side and gently placing
his hands upon her, uttered a prayer giving her his blessing. This was
because she was about to enter Bear Child's lodge to doctor a sick
child.

With the end of the service and the closing day, the Indians separated
and the entire camp subsided into quietness, broken occasionally by a
crying child in one of the lodges, or the dismal howling of distant
prairie wolves and the answering yelps of the Indian dogs.
