### CHAPTER XII

#### BEGINNING OF THE SUN-DANCE

<span class="small">Preparations of Mad Wolf and Gives-to-the-Sun.—Rules
and customs observed within the sacred lodge.—Ceremonial of consecrating
the tongues.—Methods of Medicine Men for impressing their supernatural
power upon the tribe.—Sudden death of Good Hunter, sacred woman at a
former Sun-dance.</span>

IN former days, when the Blackfeet were constantly hunting the buffalo,
the man and his wife giving the Sun-dance would begin to collect tongues
for the sacred food in the early spring, and continued gathering them
until the sarvis berries were ripe (midsummer). They went on the buffalo
hunts, but took no part in the killing. They sat upon a robe, watching
from a distance the hunters run the buffalo, praying that there might be
no accident.

When Mad Wolf and his wife began their preparations for the Sun-dance,
she became the "sacred woman." In her tipi the ceremonials would take
place. The fire burned day and night. It must not be allowed to die out,
nor the door to remain open. A sarvis berry stick or buffalo chip <span
id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_16.md) must be used to light the pipes. No other
fire was allowed within. Gives-to-the-Sun and Mad Wolf remained in fixed
places, with heads bowed and blankets drawn closely around them, praying
to the Sun by day and the Moon by night:

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

<span class="small">"Great Spirit! have pity on me and my people. Help
me to be pure and to lead a straight life. Grant that I may be
kind-hearted to all my people, and may our children and relatives live
to be old."</span>

They seldom spoke to each other, and did not go outside, while the sun
was above the horizon. Before sunrise and after sunset, a relative came
in to assist them to rise. Before they left the tipi, they chanted a
sacred song. Mad Wolf filled a pipe, and with Gives-to-the-Sun carrying
many presents, they went together to the home of O-mis-tai-po-kah, the
lodge maker of the year before, and presented the pipe to him. It was a
custom of the Blackfeet that the lodge maker and his wife be instructed
by those who had given the ceremonial the year before. The sacred
bonnet, to be worn by the woman, was purchased from them and they were
paid for their assistance. O-mis-tai-po-kah, <span

Mad Wolf and their wives smoked together and prayed to the Sun.
Henceforth, during the Sun-dance, Mad Wolf and Gives-to-the-Sun
addressed O-mis-tai-po-kah and Natokema as father and mother, for, by
smoking the pipe, they agreed to lead and instruct them. When the
tongues were dried and ready for cutting, Mad Wolf invited to his tipi
the Sun-dance priests, White Grass, Ear Rings, Curly Bear, Stock-stchi,
Double Runner, Morning Plume and Blessed Weasel, with their wives; the
men to help in chanting and praying, the women to assist
Gives-to-the-Sun in curing tongues and other necessary preparations.
When

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

they were assembled, O-mis-tai-po-kah (as father or instructor) produced
two buffalo chips, a bag of red paint and dried sweet grass. Placing the
sweet grass upon a hot coal he started a chant. As the smoke arose,
Natokema (the mother) took Gives-to-the-Sun s hand and held it in the
sacred smoke for purification. She then gave her the red paint, which
Gives-to-the-Sun rubbed over the buffalo chips. Natokema took a

tongue, which, during the ceremony that followed, was called "chief of
tongues." Holding the end towards her, she painted the north side red
and the south black, and handed it with a knife to Gives-to-the-Sun, who
arose and prayed, holding the tongue before her. After placing the knife
in the smoke of the sweet grass, she cut the tongue into thin strips for
boiling. Tongues were then distributed to the other women, who arose in
turn, and, after making confession, also cut them into

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

thin strips. If a woman made a mistake, or cut herself, while preparing
the tongues, the rest suspected that she was not pure. Two women were
selected to go to the river for water. They carried a bucket painted
with red and black bands, forming a cross on either side. While dipping
the water with small shells they avoided careless splashes, which might
bring on a sudden storm, and on the way back to the tipi stopped four
times to pray. If a storm came, the people believed it was caused by an
error in some part of the ceremonial. The women sang in unison while
they placed the tongues in the bucket and hung it over the fire. When it
boiled, Gives-to-the-Sun chanted

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I want to go to a sacred place,"</span>

</div>

and threw in sweet grass that the meat might have a pleasant fragrance.
The ceremonial of preparing the tongues was finished, when Natokema held
the bucket in the fragrant smoke. The priests and their wives again
assembled to place the sacred meat in parfleches. At this ceremony a
feast was given, but before eating, a blessing was asked upon the food,
not so simple in form as our Christian custom of giving thanks, but very
devout and expressive as a symbolic act. Each broke from his portion a
small piece, holding it up as an offering to the sun, all praying in
unison to the Spirit for long life; then, after planting it in the
ground, they supplicated Mother Earth for an abundance to eat. The
sacred meat was then placed in parfleches in readiness for the
Sun-dance, all the men and women chanting in unison

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The buffalo will wait for us."</span>

</div>

The same ceremony was repeated for every lot of tongues secured, until a
sufficient quantity had been

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

prepared. Formerly about three hundred buffalo tongues were gathered for
a Sun-dance. They now seldom secure more than thirty beef tongues. An
occurrence at another Sun-dance, during the ceremony of preparing the
tongues, illustrates the methods employed by medicine men to impress
upon the people their supernatural powers and the importance of implicit
compliance with their directions. An Indian from Canada named Big Swan,
with his wife, Good Hunter, were giving the Sun-dance. Big Swan selected
as his adviser for the ceremonies, Spotted Eagle, and invited, to assist
him, Red Wing, Wolf Eagle and Big Moon, with their wives Strikes-on-top,
Feather Woman and Calls Back. They camped together on Two Medicine
River, and were preparing the tongues. Big Swan interrupted the services
by going to Willow Creek. 'There he met Spotted Eagle, telling him that
additional tongues had been secured and the ceremonial would be
continued that evening. For a moment Spotted Eagle made no reply, but
gazed intently at the distant Rocky Mountains where his trained powers
of observation detected signs of a storm. He said to Big Swan: "When you
return to your tipi, do nothing further with the tongues to-night, put
them away." No more was said. Big Swan returned to Two Medicine River
and told the waiting men and women of Spotted Eagle's warning. Thinking
they had insufficient reason for delay, they continued the service. In
the midst of the ceremonial, a violent storm from the Rockies moved
eastwardly over their camp. A bolt of lightning struck the lodge,
prostrating the three women, Good Hunter, Strikes-on-top and Feather
Woman. The last two recovered, but Good Hunter, the sacred woman, was
killed. Big Swan discontinued the service, and, after placing the body
of his

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

wife upon a high cliff, overlooking the river, returned to Canada. In
telling me of the event Spotted Eagle said: "It cast a deep gloom over
the entire Sun-dance. If Big Swan had followed my directions it would
not have happened. I saw signs of a storm over the mountains at the head
of Two Medicine Canyon. They were bad medicine, so I warned him." Some
of the Indians, however, believed the Sun God had stricken down Good
Hunter because she had falsely declared in her prayer that she was a
pure woman.
