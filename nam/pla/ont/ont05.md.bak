### CHAPTER II

#### MY ADOPTION BY MAD WOLF

<span class="small">My meeting with Mad Wolf on the plains.—He proposes
to adopt me as his son.—Mad Wolf's camp.—The ceremonial of adoption.—Mad
Wolf's prayer.—He directs me to take part in the ceremonial.—Appoints a
second ceremonial for giving my Indian name.</span>

ONE afternoon in midsummer, while riding with Siksikakoan across the
plains, we met Mad Wolf near Willow Creek. He was alone and signified
his desire to speak with me. He was standing with his blanket drawn
closely around him. His long hair tinged with gray fell loosely over his
shoulders. From his neck hung a medicine whistle made from the wing-bone
of an eagle. In his back hair, a single eagle feather stood erect. When
I had dismounted, he warmly shook my hand. For a moment, he gazed into
my face with eyes as penetrating as those of an eagle. Then, with head
erect, he addressed me in a strong and earnest voice.

<span class="small">"The snows of two winters have now passed since you
first came to live in my country. I have been watching you continually
from the time when you first arrived, and my heart feels warm towards
you. I have never taken a son from among the white men, but I now wish
to adopt you as my son, because I believe that some day you will become
a chief among your people. I am growing old, and it is probable that I
will go before you to dwell with the Great Spirit, for you are still a
young man. When I am gone you will then be left to help and to advise my
people."</span>

Having in a few words made known to Mad Wolf

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

my willingness to become his son, he waved his hand towards the North,
and said:

<span class="small">"My lodge is out there on the plains. It is on the
other side of yonder butte, and cannot be seen from here. Come to my
lodge to-morrow, when the sun is high. My relatives will be there; I
will hold a ceremonial, in which I will paint you with the sacred red
paint, and in their presence adopt you as my son."</span>

The developments of subsequent years have enabled me more fully to
appreciate Mad Wolf's serious purpose in adopting me as his son.
Prompted by the constant misrepresentation and misunderstanding of the
Indian by the whites, his purpose was to seek a white man's strong
friendship, hoping for an alliance that would be productive of sympathy
and fidelity to the welfare of his tribe. He wanted a white
representative, who had lived sufficiently long among his <span

people, to become familiar with their customs, religion, and manner of
life, and would tell the truth about them to the white race.

Upon the day following my meeting with Mad Wolf the sky was overcast.
Riding in a northerly direction, I arrived at the ridge pointed out by
the chief. I paused on its crest, and looked down upon a small Indian
camp. The freshening wind had begun to drive low clouds over the plains,
while occasionally a furious gust shook the lodges, firmly anchored by
ropes thrown around their tops. The only living thing to be seen

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

was a coyote, slinking away over a neighbouring butte, and the only sign
of human occupation was the slender wisp of blue smoke issuing from the
top of Mad Wolf's tipi. During a lull in the wind I heard the subdued
and measured sounds of Indians chanting and beating upon drums. As I sat
still upon my horse, my mind went back many years, and I pictured to

myself the days when the ancestors of Mad Wolf and his followers were
the rulers of this entire region, and their lodges were numbered by
thousands. When the song had ceased I rode down from the ridge and
dismounting, raised the door. A small fire was burning in the center,
and in the dim light I saw that a large number of Indians were
assembled.

"Oki!" (come in), cried Mad Wolf. Upon entering I found myself in a
large, well ordered tipi of about

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

twenty-five feet in diameter. Mad Wolf was seated at the back,—the
position of honour. His relatives and friends were on either side, the
men to his left, and the women to his right. He greeted me with a warm
handshake and said, "Ke-a-e-es-tsa-kos-ach-kit-satope" (spread the robe
out for him to sit down). He wore beaded buckskin leggings and moccasins
and from his neck was suspended a medicine whistle. He had a noble
countenance, and a large and shapely head, the upper part of his body
was bare, his shoulders broad and well formed, and his arms strongly
developed, he was in every way a magnificent specimen of Indian manhood.
From his piercing glance and the firm expression of his mouth, I knew he
was accustomed to command. He had a natural dignity of manner, while
conducting the ceremonial, that fascinated me, and I found myself
intently watching his every movement.

Next to Mad Wolf, and assisting him in the ceremonial, was Natoya Apau
(Blessed Weasel). The expression of his face and eyes told me that he
had a kind heart and a good disposition. On my left was Morning Plume,
who gave me a smile of welcome and was careful of my comfort, spreading
a robe for my seat and watching that I should male no mistake during the
ceremonial. Beyond him were Isoko-yo-kinni, Double Runner, Stock-stchi,
Bear Child, and Many White Horses. The latter was so named because he
made a speciality of white horses and would have no other colour in his
herds.

To the right of Mad Wolf lay the sacred bundle of the Beaver
Medicine. <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) Next to it sat Mad Wolf's
wife, Gives-to-the-Sun. From the lodge poles over their heads hung the
Medicine Pipe and a raw-hide case

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

containing the Medicine Bonnet. <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) To
the right of Gives-to-the-Sun were women and children completely filling
the circle to the doorway of the lodge.

All sat silently gazing into the small fire, for they were about to
commence a religious ceremony. Gives-to-the-Sun spoke in a low voice to
a young woman, who arose and, bending over the fire, slowly stirred a

large kettle containing a stew of sarvis berries and tongues. Pointing
to her, Mad Wolf explained that she was his daughter who would now
become my sister, saying also, "When she was small, the enemy had
captured her, but I followed them and, when they were preparing to kill
her, I jumped among them and, striking the enemy down on both sides,
rescued her. So we named her "Strikes-on-both-sides!"

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

A large pipe of polished red stone was continually circulating, everyone
smoking except the children. The pipe always started from Mad Wolf, who
first blew four whiffs to the Sun and four to the Earth, then it was
passed to Blessed Weasel on his left, who handed it to me, stem first.
After smoking I passed it on to Morning Plume. On its return I handed it
to Blessed Weasel, stem first as before, but was corrected by him, with
the explanation that, in going towards Mad Wolf, the pipe should have
been handed bowl first. No one else seemed to notice this infraction of
one of their customs. I was often impressed, in gatherings of the
Blackfeet, by the dignified courtesy and genuine nobility of manners on
the part of their head men, in passing over, without remark, or notice,
any unwitting breach of social or ceremonial observance.

Mad Wolf began the ceremonial by taking a hot coal from the fire with a
long forked stick. He placed dried sweet grass upon it and the rising
smoke soon filled the lodge with a pleasing fragrance. At this moment
the clouds parted in the sky, and the sun came out. The bright rays,
streaming down through the top of the lodge, shone upon the ground in
front of Mad Wolf. Holding his hands in the sweet smoke of the incense,
Mad Wolf passed them along his arms and upon his breast to purify
himself, and then chanted:

"To-day, our father (Sun) shines into the lodge, his power is very
strong.

"Last night our mother (Moon) shone into the lodge, her power is very
strong.

"I pray the Morning Star (their Son) that, when he rises at daybreak, he
too will shine in to bless us and to bring us long life."

Mad Wolf and Blessed Weasel together led a chorus in which all joined.
The women held aloft their left

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

hands and closely watched Mad Wolf, who with bent arms held his hands
folded on a level with his head. Then passing his hands along his arms
alternately, after their manner of a blessing, he finally folded them
upon his breast, and chanted:

"Mother Earth have pity on us, and give us food to eat!

"Father, the Sun, bless all our children, and may our paths be
straight!"

Taking a sacred stick decorated with red paint, representing a cane, Mad
Wolf placed it upon his right and left shoulders in turn, and prayed for
long life. Blessed Weasel did likewise, handing the cane to me. I laid
it upon both of my shoulders while they prayed that I might live to be
old. The cane was passed around the circle, all performing the same
ceremony. When the stick was returned to Mad Wolf, he and Blessed Weasel
with their wives placed their hands upon it and sang a low chant.

Mad Wolf brought forth a small buckskin bag from which he took some red
clay, the sacred paint which the Blackfeet believe has power to ward off
sickness and to bring long life. When I saw him preparing it in his
hands, I knew the moment for my adoption had arrived. There was an
impressive silence as he motioned to me and said, "Here comes my white
son." While kneeling before him, he painted my face on the forehead,
chin and both cheeks, representing the Sun's daily course through the
heavens. The forehead represented the rising, and the left cheek the
setting Sun. Then taking the beaver skin, he passed it down both sides
of my head, shoulders and arms to the hands, ending with an upward
movement, by which he imparted his blessing and prayed:

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

<span class="small">"Before you, my father, Great Sun Chief, I now adopt
this young man as my son. Let the red paint be like the sunlight to
protect and bring him health and strength. May all my people be friendly
and protect him that he may be happy as long as he remains among his
Indian brothers and sisters. My father, the Sun, who gives us light,
keep him from harm when he goes again to his home towards the East. Give
him light by day, that his path may be free from danger. If he should go
into the wrong trail, lead him safely back, that his path may be firm
and down hill to old age. As the sweet smoke of the incense ascends
towards the sky, so may our prayers arise and be acceptable to thee, O
thou great Sun God!"</span>

After the prayer Mad Wolf directed Blessed Weasel to unroll a bundle
containing buffalo and elk hides, which were spread out before the men.
Large rattles were also distributed among them. Mad Wolf handed me two
rattles, saying "You are now my son and should take part in this
ceremonial." Kneeling on the ancient buffalo hide, I joined with them in
the chants and beat time on the hide with my rattles. The first chant we
sang represented a porcupine sitting on a hill and watching a beaver at
work. The porcupine said: "I will take my bow and arrows and kill you."
But the beaver jumping into the stream swam off under the water and
escaped. We also sang the song of the war eagle, describing it as
soaring high in the air above the mountain peaks and at times swooping
down towards the earth when seeking its prey. Mad Wolf then danced
around the fire with the pipe, singing and, at intervals, blowing upon
his medicine whistle. Stock-stchi took the pipe from Mad Wolf. He blew
four whiffs to the North, South, East and West, and then, holding the
pipe towards the Sun, prayed to the Great Spirit in the Sun for the
recovery of his sick child.

Mad Wolf ended the ceremonial at sunset with the prayer:

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

"Great Sun God! Continue to give us your light that the leaves and grass
may grow so that our cattle will increase and our children may live to
be old.

"Our mother! (the Moon), give us sleep that we may rise again like our
father (the Sun). May our lives be strong, and may our hearts feel good
towards our white brothers, as we are all your children."

When the wife of Blessed Weasel arose to ladle out the stew, Mad Wolf
directed that she set aside for his white son some of the tongue which
the Blackfeet consider a delicacy. When the stew had been passed to
everyone, I was preparing to eat, when Blessed Weasel motioned to me.
Then I noticed that all were waiting. To my surprise it was for a
blessing upon the food, for, after a short pause, Mad Wolf said: "The
berries that grow are blessed, for upon them we live." He held a sarvis
berry aloft in his right hand and chanted, everyone imitating his
motions and joining with him in his prayer to Mother Earth that they
might live to see many summers. After each person had planted a berry in
the ground, a symbolic act in recognition of the source of their
sustenance, they partook of the feast. None of the food was wasted. What
remained was gathered together and set aside.

When I was ready to depart for my camp, Mad Wolf said, "O-mis-tai-po-kah
(White Calf), the head chief, and I are selecting for you an Indian
name. I ask you to come again to my lodge in one week." I replied, that
next day I would start with Siksikakoan on a hunting expedition into the
Rocky Mountains. He sat in silence for a moment and then said:

<span class="small">"It is now the moon when the leaves are beginning to
turn yellow. I have adopted you as my son, and you have met my family
and relatives. On the first day of the full moon, at the</span>

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

<span class="small">time when the leaves are falling, I will be camped
on the South Fork of Cutbank River. Come to my lodge on that day, for I
will have there the leading chiefs and medicine men. I will hold a
sacred ceremonial, and will unroll the ancient Medicine Bundle <span
id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_7.md) of the Beavers. We will give you an Indian
name, again painting you with the sacred paint, and receiving you into
the tribe of the Blackfeet."</span>
