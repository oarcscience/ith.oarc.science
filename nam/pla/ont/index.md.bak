Walter McClintock went to Montana with a US Forestry Service expedition
in 1896. He spent the next four years living on the land with the
Blackfeet, one of the most northern of the Great Plains tribes. He was
adopted into the tribe by the Chief Mad Dog, and got a chance to learn
their traditions firsthand. The book presents Blackfeet folklore and
religious traditions in context. The narrative of his gradual adoption
into Blackfeet society is a classic Western tale, but it is also a
classic of 19th century ethnography. Unfettered by modern
anthropological protocols and given total access by his hosts,
McClintock produced the primary source on the Blackfeet just after the
collapse of their traditional way of life.

Production Note: Due to the number of illustrations in this book, images
are presented at about half of the usual resolution. We apologize for
the reduced quality, which is needed to control the cost of hosting this
book in its entirety.
