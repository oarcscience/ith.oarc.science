ON the morning of the second day of the Sun-dance, Elk Horn, the herald,
rode through camp, announcing with his powerful voice that the Kisapa
(Hair Parters, a social organisation composed of young men) were
preparing for a dance and invited everyone to be present. In his left
hand he carried a long spear. At regular intervals along its staff,
eagle feathers were attached, falling free and fluttering in the wind.
Coyote tails, representing his medicine animal, were fastened to his
stirrups. He wore a buckskin shirt and a blue beaded necklace of many
strands. About his waist was draped a red blanket decorated with a band
of white beads. His leggings and moccasins were ornamented with
porcupine quills, and large pieces of cottonwood punk were fastened to
his blanket for their sweet perfume. When the young men, coming from
different

parts of the camp, assembled for the dance, they were dressed in their
gayest and finest clothes. They wore war-bonnets of eagle feathers
tipped with coloured horsehair, and ornamented with beads and porcupine
quills, and caps made by winding otter and mink skins around their
heads, the tails hanging down behind. Some were stripped and their faces
and bodies were painted; others had war-shirts and leggings of
soft-tanned deer <span id="img_27200"></span>

skin heavily beaded, or decorated with coloured porcupine quills and
trimmed with ermine along the shoulders and leggings. They wore
necklaces variously made of beads, small bones, elk-teeth, shells and
grizzly bear claws. They also had dog-skin ankle-bands with bells
attached and arm-bands of deer skin and brass, with pendants of grouse
and woodpecker feathers. They carried shields, spears, bows and arrows,
tomahawks and rattles made of deer and elk-hoofs tied together in
bunches.

All sat down in a semi-circle, and when forty or fifty had arrived, the
singers began, accompanied by the drums.

First came the dance of the warriors, in which everyone who took part
had been in battle. A prominent chief had eight parallel black lines on
his leggings, representing the number of chiefs, or medicine men he

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

had killed; another had a war-shirt covered with marks representing
picket pins with short lariats attached. These signified the number of
horses, picketed close to the lodge of the enemy, he had cut loose, with
great risk of being captured. This was followed by the dance of those
who had been wounded. Wolf Eagle, a fine looking fellow,<span

whose arm had been shot off by the enemy, entered into the dance with
great energy, carrying in his single hand the feather-decorated bone of
his missing arm. One dancer, named "Behind-the-ear," continually aimed
his rifle, as if in the act of shooting. He had received his name from
shooting an enemy behind the ear, and was now going through the motions
which recalled the deed. Another warrior, who had been a noted stealer
of horses from the enemy, carried a horse carved out of wood. Others had
tomahawks, spears, arrows, feathered shields and war-bonnets. Every
movement of the dance and the distinguishing marks of the dancers had a
significance, which it is impossible for an outsider to understand.

When an eagle feather fell from Sepe-nama's war-bonnet, he selected Bear
Chief, a noted warrior, to pick

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

it up, because it would bring him bad luck to do it himself. With Bear
Chief as their leader, they danced in single file three times around the
feather. When passing it the fourth time, Bear Chief picked it up and
they returned to their seats.

The leader was Black Weasel, a tall and handsome<span

Indian, whose seat in the surrounding circle was marked by a feathered
wand driven into the ground. He wore a large war-bonnet of selected
eagles’ feathers, and a soft-tanned buckskin suit trimmed with ermine
tails. It was decorated across the shoulders and along the arms and legs
with coloured porcupine quills, beautifully laid. When it was time to
commence a figure, he moved about the circle, wand in hand, hustling the
dancers out and giving sharp raps to those who lagged behind. He was as
considerate, however, as he was energetic, in enforcing discipline, for
he devoted part of his efforts to seeing that visiting Indians were
comfortably seated, and that the women and children were supplied with
drinking water.

The most interested of the large circle of spectators seemed to be
Nokoa, the small son of Wolverine. He

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

was seated beside his mother, watching with filial admiration every
movement of his father, who was taking part in the dance. Nokoa wore a
beaded necklace of many strands and a fringed buckskin suit. His

</span>

bright eyes fairly danced with excitement, when his father led him out
before the company. He stepped forward fearlessly, swaying his small
body to and fro, aiming his stick as if it were a gun, while his little
moccasined feet kept perfect time with the beating of the drums.

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

While they were feasting, Running Crane addressed the people:

<span class="small">"I am now glad in my heart to see you gathered
together. The young men are dressed in their beautiful clothes, and they
dance well. It is not often that we have such a good time,—only once a
year. Lawless shooting has all been stopped, and we have ceased to count
coups, yet we are all happy. I hope that the Great Father (the
President) will not stop our coming together, for it</span>

</span>

<span class="small">does not last long. Let the old people restrain the
young men, so that we may break camp and return to our homes without
having any disturbance. I have now finished. My name is Seco-mo-muckon
(Running Crane)."</span>

Nena-es-toko (Mountain Chief) then arose to tell of the old days and how
he used to dance. He urged the people to be generous and give many
horses to the Sioux, because they were visitors, and had come on a long
journey from the far east. He held a small stick,

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

which represented a horse, and, when he had finished speaking, stepped
across the circle and handed the stick to a Sioux Indian. From the crowd
of spectators there came the voice of another old chief singing, "Good
man, giving away your horse so generously."

A band of Indians, under Chief Little Plume, appeared on a high ridge to
the north, representing a victorious war party returning to the tribal
camp with spoils. Their faces and horses were decorated with paint, and
they were dressed in beaded buckskin clothes

<span id="img_27700"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![SHAM BATTLE BY
HORSEMEN.](tn/27700.jpg)

</span>

and war-bonnets. They rode rapidly across the plain in single file, and
entered camp at a gallop with war whoops and piercing yells. Then,
forming into line, with Little Plume in the lead, they marched slowly
around the camp circle, with rifles in the position of firing, holding
aloft the sacred Spear and singing their song of victory. <span
id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_21.md) The warriors then gathered together in the
large open space in the centre of the camp, where they gave exhibitions,
before the tribe, of sham battles,

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

both on horseback and on foot, re-enacting their victories of former
days.

I also witnessed some exciting horse races. The course lay over a level
stretch and along a low ridge, where crowds of Indian spectators were
seated. On one side was the tribal camp of picturesque lodges. The
surrounding prairies were dressed in the living green of spring,
embroidered with wild flowers. The distant snow-covered peaks of the
Rocky Mountains furnished a magnificent background, at the head of the
course. The young riders were completely stripped. They were excellent
horsemen, riding fearlessly the wildest bronchos, using no saddle, and,
for a bridle, only a rope passed through the horse's mouth. I secured an
excellent view of the most exciting race of the day, by standing near
the finish, where a large crowd of Indians had gathered, wagering,
instead of money, horses, cattle, robes, blankets, and even provisions
upon the result. At the start, the horses could be seen rearing and
plunging, until a loud shout was heard, and we realised that they were
off. As they passed us in a cloud of dust, the riders, excited by the
shrill war whoops of the spectators, shouted in turn to their horses for
greater speed, lying low upon their backs and beating them with raw-hide
quirts. They finished amid intense excitement and rejoicing by the
Indians, who bet on Bull Shoe, their horse, which won by a narrow
margin.

While eating our evening meal, Strikes-on-both-sides suddenly opened the
door, exclaiming, "Come quickly A-pe-ech-eken, and see the Pena-pes-ena
Warriors (Below People or Sioux)." I was just in time to photograph them
passing in a long line. They were led by Lone Dog as chief, and riding
beside him were Red Boy, Bear Paw, and White Eagle. They were dressed in
beaded

</span>

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

clothes of bright colours, with horned head-dresses and feathered
shields on their backs. Many tinkling bells were attached to their
horses, which were also painted and otherwise decorated. They marched
slowly through camp, holding their spears and feathered ensigns aloft

and singing in unison a striking Celebration song <span
id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) with the words:

<span class="small">"Oh, Blackfeet! we have heard you boast in the past
that you were becoming like white men. We now behold you taking part in
these ceremonials, poorly dressed, and with few of your Indian clothes
left."</span>

In accordance with a time-honoured Indian custom, it was expected that
those before whose lodges they stopped and sang would give them
presents. If the Blackfeet were not generous, they could not expect many
gifts, when the return visit to the Sioux would be

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

made. After completing the circle they dismounted at the lodge of
Ahkiona, where they gave a ceremonial. When Ahkiona had visited the
Sioux they presented him with a Medicine Pipe. On this occasion the Pipe
was to be returned to its former owners.

Exhausted by the excitement and heat of the day, I returned to my lodge
and was soon asleep in spite of the singing and drumming of the dancing
Sioux. But it was not long before I was rudely awakened by the fierce
snarling and yelping of a vicious dog-fight near by. The fight of this
single pair quickly roused other dogs and they rushed together to engage
in a mass fight. Soon hundreds of dogs in all parts of the camp, excited
by the uproar, united in a great deep-throated mournful howl, such as is
only heard in a large Indian village, and resembles the howling of an
enormous pack of wolves.

When their dismal chorus had finally died away, I stepped outside the
lodge. The full moon was rising from the plains, flooding the camp with
its light. The lodges with their crowns of tapering poles stood out in
sharp relief against the burnished eastern sky. To the west were the dim
outlines of the rugged Rockies, behind which a large planet was slowly
sinking. The constellation of the Northern Crown (called "The Camp," by
the Blackfeet, because of the suggestiveness of its outlines) had passed
over into the west, while, in the east, the sparkling Pleiades (Lost
Children) were rising above the plains. Although it was late, the camp
was still so throbbing with life that sleep was made impossible. Many
young men were on horseback, singing Riding songs <span
id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) as they rode around the circle of the
encampment. The dance at Ahkiona's

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

lodge was finished, and the Sioux were returning to their quarters,
singing a Travelling song in their own tongue. When they had finished,
the answering notes of a Night song <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_24.md)
were heard from a small band of Blackfeet, sitting on the shore of the
lake. A large company of men and women on horseback, having learned a
Celebration song <span id="fr_29"></span>[2](#fn_25.md) from the visiting
Sioux, rode slowly through the camp singing it at intervals. Red Fox and
his young wife, riding the same horse, made circuits of the camp,
singing a Night song of remarkable beauty. I saw them very distinctly,
when they passed, their strongly coloured Indian clothes showing in the
bright moonlight. The woman rode in front, wearing a magnificent bonnet
of eagle feathers, belonging to her husband, and a buckskin dress
heavily beaded across the shoulders. Red Fox wore a band of weasel skin
around his head, with an eagle feather erect in his back hair. A
beautifully tanned elk-skin robe, decorated with red stripes of
porcupine quills, extended in graceful folds from his shoulders backward
over the horse's tail. He carried a string of bells, which he used in
marking time for their singing. Their song had a very pronounced rhythm,
which was in perfect time with the slow trot of their horse. They
continued their striking duet at intervals through the night, not
stopping until day began to dawn.

When I first heard the Blackfeet singing together in unison, with
untrained voices, the women's an octave higher than the men's, my
impressions were not pleasing. But, having learned several of their
airs, and mastered the peculiar intervals and difficult voice
vibrations, so that I could join in their singing, the wild beauty of
their music dawned upon me. Their music seemed so

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

thoroughly original in its conception, and so unique in the method of
expression, that I became filled with the desire to do something for its
preservation. It strongly appealed to me, that its development through
past ages had been independent of all sources of inspiration or
colouring, other than those of their natural environment of mountains,
forests and plains, their wild life of hunting and warfare, their
Sun-worship, and those emotions and passions which are common to the
human heart the world over.

I also felt that the beautiful motives of their sacred hymns, war-songs,
love and night songs, springing from these aboriginal sources, like pure
water from a mountain spring, were so entirely original and thoroughly
American, that they ought to be rescued from oblivion and permanently
preserved. <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_26.md)
