WE remained several days in the Blood camp to rest our horses and visit
Indian relatives and friends. The Bloods are a fine looking tribe, but
reserved and haughty. They seem to be on the best of terms with the
North Blackfeet, but are not popular with other tribes, because of their
conceit and arrogance. The Piegans have a saying, "He is just like a
Blood, he likes to show off." They also speak of the Bloods as "generous
givers, but always seeking to get back as large a return as possible."

An incident occurred, while I was present at a Sun-dance of the Piegans,
which illustrates the peculiar manners of the Bloods. It was in a large
assembly of Indians, including representatives from sixteen different
tribes, guests of the Piegans, who were gathered around the Sun-lodge,
listening to the war stories of prominent chiefs. Unlike their white
brothers, it is the custom of

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Indians to always
listen with respectful attention to the speeches of their leaders,
without regard to their importance. But not so with a visiting band of
young men from the Bloods. While the old Piegan chiefs were recounting
their brave deeds in battle, the Bloods

<span id="img_36900"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![HEAD CHIEF OF
BLOODS.](tn/36900.jpg)

</span>

gave great affront and transgressed all custom and etiquette by publicly
ridiculing their stories.

For my own part, I have found that the Bloods are not so approachable,
and lack the cordiality and open hearted friendliness so characteristic
of the Piegans.

After sunset, on our way to One Spot's lodge, we were startled by the
mournful wailing of a woman, standing upon a lonely butte, overlooking
the river valley.

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Snake Woman told
us that she was the mother of Has-many-guns-in-the-camp, mourning over
his death. The sad news had just come, that he had died in the camp of
the North Blackfeet. While absent on a long journey, he had heard that
his wife had left him for another. Has-many-guns mourned so deeply over
the loss of

</span>

his wife, that he refused to eat and finally died from starvation.

The similarity of the cause of this pathetic incident,—the infidelity of
a wife,—reminds me of a much more tragical event, which happened in the
winter of 1896, during my visit among the Piegans.

Opiowan, a Blood Indian, living just across the border in Alberta,
killed his rival, who had stolen his wife's

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

affections. For many weeks he kept the Indian families on both sides of
"the line" at the highest pitch of excitement and alarm because of his
sudden attacks and cold blooded murders. He proved himself more than a
match for the Canadian Mounted Police in his Indian cunning and
resourcefulness in evading arrest.

This Opiowan tragedy illustrates the capabilities of a single Indian for
cunning, ferocity and physical endurance,

<span id="img_37100"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![BLOOD CUSTOM OF

when fired by revenge for wrongs suffered. When one such was multiplied
into a band, or tribe united for revenge, as in the cases of the Sioux,
Apaches and Nez-Perces, it meant a bloody war against the whites. War
meant extermination for the Indian, for it developed among the whites
that bitter animosity which was universal along the frontier and still
finds expression in that laconic but barbarous saying, "The only good
Indian is a dead Indian."

Opiowan was reported as frequenting so many localities

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

and as moving about with such incredible swiftness, while murdering
indiscriminately, that all, whether in the mountains, or on the plains,
were in dread of a surprise by him. The Piegan women spoke of him in
great fear as the "Mad Indian," while the mere mention of his name
filled the children with terror. When I asked Snake Woman for the Blood
account, she related the following thrilling story of vengeance under
the "unwritten law."

#### TRAGEDY OF OPIOWAN, "THE MAD INDIAN."

"Opiowan once lived at peace with all our tribe. He was known as an
industrious man, living contentedly in a lodge with his two wives, his
mother and his only child, a boy of eight. A young man named Natomina, a
former lover of Pretty Wolverine, his favourite wife, began coming to
the lodge. When he became so deeply enamoured that his attentions were
the talk of the tribe, Opiowan warned him to desist. One day Opiowan
prepared for a journey, as if he would be absent for several days. He
rode off over a ridge, but, instead of going farther, lay in ambush to
watch his lodge. When he saw Natomina and Pretty Wolverine cross the
meadow together, he quietly returned and with drawn knife came
unexpectedly upon the guilty lovers. He mutilated and killed Natomina,
but spared his wife. Having ordered her to return quietly to the lodge,
he continued his journey. When the Mounted Police discovered Natomina's
dead body, some days later, they carried it through the camp, vainly
endeavouring to find some trace of the murderer. When Opiowan returned
from his journey, he heard the people talking about the mysterious
murder. At night the face of Natomina

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

was always before him, so that he was unable to sleep. He dreaded
hearing a rider enter the camp, lest it might be one of the Mounted
Police coming to arrest him. He became morose and gloomy and shunned his
friends, imagining that all had turned against him. He thought he must
be going mad and desired to live no longer. Resolved to die the death of
a brave, he vowed he would kill as many people as he could, both Indian
and white. Passing the store at night, and seeing the trader standing
near a window, he raised his rifle and fired. He saw the trader fall
forward upon his face and then fled in the darkness. Returning to his
lodge, he told his wives that he had shot a white man, and he must hide
in the mountains. The lodge was quickly taken down, and their belongings
packed upon a travois. Opiowan put on his war charm and, painting his
face, chanted a war song. They entered the Rocky Mountains, camping in a
small glade, where their lodge was hidden by the trees. When the Mounted
Police heard of Opiowan's escape, they knew he must be the murderer and
followed his trail. But Opiowan, watching from a neighbouring cliff, saw
them coming. Knowing they would enter the glade from below, he left his
mother and son in the lodge and with his wives circled through the
forest. The police tied their horses at the lower end of the glade and
advanced on foot. They shot into the lodge, but the boy and woman lay
flat and were not hit. Opiowan then came quickly from the forest and
made off with their horses. The police captured the old mother and the
boy and withdrew, after destroying the lodge, but Opiowan, with his two
wives, escaped by going northward along the Rockies. When they came to
the country of the North Piegans, they entered the Porcupine Mountains
and hid

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

themselves in the forest. Whenever they ran short of food, or
ammunition, Opiowan stole down at night into an Indian camp, shooting
anyone who would oppose his demands. One day he rode boldly through the
main street of a small town (Cardston), and shot one of the police. They
followed him many miles, but were unable to capture him. On a big flat
beyond the Kootenai River, Opiowan killed another of his pursuers, whose
horse had outrun the others, and seizing the policeman's rifle and
ammunition, escaped into the forest. The autumn passed and winter came
on with intense cold and deep snow, but no one could 'find his hiding
place. One night, in a heavy snow storm, Opiowan left the camp of
Brings-down-the-Sun, where he had suddenly appeared to demand food and
[ammunition](errata.htm#3.md). He lost his way and was followed by the
police, but again managed to elude his pursuers. At last, fearing that
his wives might desert him while absent on foraging expeditions, he
hobbled them, tying their hands and feet, but leaving them separated
from each other. Managing to free themselves, they made their way down
the mountains by night and came into the Blood camp on the plains, where
they were arrested. Opiowan, deserted by his wives, without food and
suffering from the intense cold, was finally driven from the mountains
by starvation. He came one night to the lodge of his brother Sixepe, who
kept him in hiding. The information was carried to the police, who
surrounded the camp, and ordered them to give up the outlaw. Our chiefs
in their alarm finally prevailed upon Sixepe to betray his brother into
the hands of the police. As he lay tied hand and foot, Opiowan warned
his brother that he would die first. Within four days Sixepe suddenly
sickened and died. Opiowan also died soon after, killing

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

himself by piercing the arteries of both wrists with a sharp awl."

 

We left the Blood camp soon after sunrise, riding along the Okoan River,
and through groves of large

<span id="img_37500"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![SUN-SHELTER AT
MIDDAY.](tn/37500.jpg)

</span>

cottonwoods. After fording the river, we turned towards the mountains
and the country of the North Piegans. Heavy clouds covered the plain,
completely hiding the rising sun. But the snow-clad summits of the
Rockies in the west, glowed in the rays that shone above the clouds. We
followed an old Indian trail known to Kionama and Onesta, a short cut,
that took us across a broad plain. When we entered the hill

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

country beyond, the clouds disappeared and the hot sun again shone in a
clear sky. My thermometer registered 98 degrees in the shade and 130
degrees in the sun. We rested our horses at midday near a small lake.
The women erected a shelter from the sun by throwing canvas over a wagon
pole, supported on a tripod. The sides were then raised, allowing the
breeze to blow through.

In the early afternoon clouds gathered over the Rocky Mountains.
Electrical storms appeared in all directions and the air gradually
became cooler. While slowly winding our way among the high hills, I
heard Onesta and Nitana chanting a religious song. I quietly rode behind
them and, after becoming thoroughly familiar with the air, joined in the
chant. They explained that it was an ancient custom, while travelling
towards a strange country, to chant and offer prayers to the Sun for a
prosperous journey and safe return. Onesta said, "On this occasion, we
have been praying also, that you may be successful in securing the
information you desire from the North Piegans. I intend giving the
Sup-weyo-kinni (Crow Beaver) ceremonial in their camp and I will teach
you some of the chants, so that you can help us in the singing." Nitana
expressed her uneasiness, lest some misfortune might overtake us,
because one of the medicine sticks of the Crow Beaver Bundle had been
broken while in the Blood camp.

Onesta taught me the Worm song, which the Blackfeet use to make worms
dance. When we came to a wild rose bush covered with cobwebs enclosing
small worms (Tent Caterpillars), he directed me to stand near and sing,
"Kom-i-os-ché! Kom-i-os-ché!" (Worms! Worms!), beating time by clapping
my hands. To my surprise, the worms, which had been perfectly still,
began to move

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

as if slowly waking up. They soon became more active, until all stood
erect and swayed their heads to and fro. Onesta sang another song, with
which, he said, he could make a sand-piper dance, by clapping his hands
and singing, "Ék-si-sa-que! Ék-si-sa-que!" (Meat! Meat!)

He called my attention to the swallows hovering over the horses to
secure hairs for their nests, and also to the grasshoppers flying high
in the air "to colour their wings." Grasshoppers’ wings are said to be
without colour, until they fly into the sunlight, which turns them red,
yellow and black.

When we finally gained the summit of the ridge, we looked down upon the
broad valley of the North Piegans, through which flowed a river,
bordered with huge cottonwood trees. Towards the north were the
Porcupine Mountains covered with dark forests of pine, and westward were
the snow-capped summits of the Rockies. While descending towards the
valley, we met several young men of the North Piegans, guarding their
tribal herds of cattle and horses. They guided us towards the camp of
Brings-down-the-Sun. One of them, whom I afterwards discovered was the
son of Crow Eagle, the head chief, rode with me. He pointed out an
enormous solitary rock upon the prairie, and said: "Many years ago a
huge grizzly lived in a cave beneath that rock. Around it grow different
varieties of berry bushes from seeds carried there by the bear." The
Porcupine Mountains are so named, because the ridges bristle so thickly
with tall trees that they resemble a porcupine's back. The river in the
valley before us was called Old Man's River by the white men, but Crow
Lodge by the Indians, the vision for the Crow Lodge having been received
in former days near its source. The high mountain, with a broad slide
shining like a huge glacier, is called Turtle

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mountain by the
whites, but is named Lodge Lining by the Indians, because its slopes are
uniform and regular, resembling the inside lining of a lodge.

Having reached the river, Crow Eagle's son invited us to his tipi. But,
when Onesta explained that we must go direct to the camp of
Brings-down-the-Sun, he

<span id="img_37800"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![HERDER LASSOING
WILD HORSE.](tn/37800.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/37800.jpg.md)

</span>

pointed out to us a distant bend in the Crow Lodge River, saying that we
would find Natosin Nepe-e (Brings-down-the-Sun) there among the big
trees on the north bank.

After the young men had left us, I observed a single horseman appear
upon the summit of a distant ridge and remain to watch our course, that
we might not go astray. The trail led down a steep hill and into the

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

valley. A wolf standing motionless, watched us from the head of a small
ravine. The colour of his coat was so like the grass and willows
surrounding him that he had an excellent colour protection. The deep
shade of the big trees and luxuriant vegetation of the river valley were
most refreshing, after the fierce sunlight and heat of the plains. The
meadows were bright with a

<span id="img_37900"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![“A SINGLE HORSEMAN
APPEARED UPON A RIDGE TO WATCH OUR COURSE.”](tn/37900.jpg)

beautiful pink flower called Manekape (young man) by the Blackfeet, but
known by botanists as Horse Mint, or Monarda scabra. The trail ran
sometimes close to the broad, swift river, now through meadows of grass
and flowers and now among the cottonwoods. Passing through an opening
among the trees, I saw, in the distance, a group of Indians, wrapped in
blankets, standing on the edge of a high cut-bank overlooking the
valley. They were watching our approach with evident

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

interest. Onesta explained to me that it was a "Lookout Butte" for the
camp of Brings-down-the-Sun. From its summit, not only the river valley,
but also the surrounding plains could be viewed for a long distance. As
we drew nearer, I discovered that the watchers were women. One with a
baby on her back, her long black hair flying in the wind, and her figure
distinctly outlined against the evening sky, was standing surrounded by
children. Nitana recognised her as Long Hair, favourite daughter of
Brings-down-the-Sun. As we approached the edge of the clearing, a group
of white lodges among the trees came into view. It was the camp of the
noted medicine man, with his children, grandchildren and
great-grandchildren. In front of a lodge, beneath a huge cottonwood, and
close to where the trail again entered the trees, a tall figure, with a
blanket wrapped closely around him, stood gazing intently at us. When he
recognised Onesta, he hailed us and said: "My children, I will be glad
to have you pitch your lodges close to mine, under the big trees on the
other side of the trail." I rode nearer to observe him more closely. He
was an elderly man with clean-cut Indian features. His hair was grey and
the deep lines in his face indicated a strong character, burdened with
care and responsibility. With hand upraised and head thrown back, he had
the air of one accustomed to command. Pointing to the meadow, he
continued, "However, if you wish, you can camp in the open at the edge
of the cottonwoods. Sometimes heavy wind-storms tear branches from the
trees, and if your lodges were beneath they might injure you. On the
north side of the clearing you will find a spring, where the water is
cold and good to drink. It will be better for you to take your horses
upon the hills, where they

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

can feed upon the abundant bunch grass." With these words the chief
withdrew into his lodge.

The cool shade of the woods proved such an attraction that we promptly
selected the spot beneath the big trees pointed out by
Brings-down-the-Sun. While our lodges were being pitched, Sis-tse
(Bird), wife of the chief, with her daughters and daughters-in-law,
arrived, bearing many presents. This exchange of gifts among the women
was always an interesting performance. They often gave many objects,
that were highly prized by themselves, although they might seem of
little value to white people. For instance, Nitana received on this
occasion an old tea-pot, a wash tub and board, a small bag of beans, two
plates, two cups, a copper kettle and a butcher knife. In return, she
gave two blankets, two pairs of moccasins, paints dug by herself on
Birch Creek, and a few trinkets. Bird brought an invitation from
Brings-down-the-Sun, for Onesta, Kionama and their friend, the white
man, to eat with him at sunset. When we walked down the wooded trail
towards the tipis of the chief and his son Running Wolf, standing close
together at the end of a grove of huge cottonwoods, we came upon an
ideal camp and the most peaceful and charming picture of a happy and
contented Indian family it has ever been my good fortune to see. A large
outside fire sent a shower of golden sparks into the air. It lighted up
the white tipis with their clusters of tapering poles, and tops deeply
browned by smoke, and brought them into sharp contrast with the dark
trunks and green branches of the big cottonwood trees. Grouped around
the fire, and dressed in brightly coloured Indian clothes, were women
and young girls engaged in animated conversation, while cooking, making
clothes and moccasins and playing Indian games.

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> To one side a
little baby hammock, swung between two saplings, was rocked by a mother
singing a Blackfeet slumber song. When we stepped into the circle of
bright firelight, this peaceful scene was rudely disturbed by a dog
dashing at us, with flattened ears and snarling fiercely. A squaw
shouted, "Puksiput! kokun! Kopsksis-e!" (Come back here! you pup! Swell
Nose!), but the damage was done. The group of young girls, warned of the
approach of the strange white man, fled precipitately into the woods,
and the charming circle was quickly broken.
