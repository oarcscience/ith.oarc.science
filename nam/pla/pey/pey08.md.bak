### JESSE CLAY'S ACCOUNT OF THE ARAPAHO MANNER OF GIVING THE PEYOTE, CEREMONY WHICH HE INTRODUCED AMONG THE WINNEBAGO IN 1912

I went to Oklahoma once as the guest of an Arapaho Indian. While there I
witnessed the Arapaho manner of holding a peyote meeting and was very
much impressed with it. A year later this Arapaho came to visit me in
Winnebago, and while he was with us a few of my friends urged me to hold
the peyote ceremony according to the Arapaho method. I held several
meetings at which my Arapaho friend led.

Now these are the instructions that Arapaho Bull gave me.

The person giving the ceremony must get up at sunrise so that he can
tell exactly where the sun is going to rise. He must place a stick and
make the drawing of a cross on the earth just in that direction from
which the sun is about to rise. He does this in order to get the correct
location for the tipi and the fireplace. Then he marks a circle around
the cross. Then he makes a diagonal mark through the center of the
circle, thus making the circle resemble a star. The circle is the
outline of the tipi. Then another diagonal mark is made so that the
drawing resembles, to their minds, a peyote. A fireplace which resembles
a half-moon is placed right in the center of the lodge. After that the
tipi poles are raised, 12 in number. Finally the whole is inclosed in
canvas. When finished it is supposed to represent the earth. It is then
ready to be entered. Special preparations are made for entering. The
drummer with his drum and the leader and those behind him with all their
regalia march up to the door. Before these enter, however, an attendant,
called the fireman, spreads sage all over the lodge, from the seat of
the leader to the door and back again. Then he starts a fire, always
placing the left fire sticks first. When they are all thus lined up
outside of the door the leader offers a prayer.

"May the Creator be with us when we enter this lodge."

The leader now enters and, proceeding along the left side of the lodge,
marches to his seat, and there he stands with his drum until the lodge
is filled. After all have entered they sit down. Then the fireman who
sits to the right rekindles the fire. The leader now spreads out his
articles—a gourd, a drumstick, a staff, and the feathers. He then takes
12 sage leaves and lays them out in the form of a star, first making a
cross-shaped object and then filling this into the desired form. On top
he places the peyote, and, leaning against that, be places a flute made
of an eagle bone, the mouth of the flute resting against the peyote.
Then he puts an otter-skin cap at the foot of the flute. After a while
the leader takes the peyote he is going to use in one hand and some
cedar needles in the other,

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

and, going to his seat, where all the other objects are spread out, he
sits down and prays. He prays that all the participants may be
strengthened by the prospective meeting. He offers up thanks for the
peyote and prays that all may be in the proper spirit that night. Then
he throws the needles in the fire and holds the peyote over the smoke of
the cedar. When this has been finished he returns to his seat, eats one
peyote, and gives one to the drummer. After they have eaten these he
passes four peyote in turn to those on his left until the peyote comes
to the one sitting nearest the door. Four peyote are given to the one
nearest the door that he, in turn, may pass them to those on the other
side of the door and so on until the leader is reached again. Before the
peyote is eaten, the leader gets up and talks. He instructs the people
as to the nature of the meeting and tells them that those who wish to go
out must do so after the midnight water is drunk and not until after the
leader returns from outside. No one is to go out while anyone is
singing, praying, or eating peyote. He then speaks of the special
prayers that are to be offered up and asks them to offer general prayers
for all nonmembers and even for their enemies. After that the leader
again offers up a prayer and smokes all the objects he had spread before
his seat. Then the songs are to start, all, however, first eating
peyote.

(When the fire first starts and thereafter, throughout the night, it is
supposed to represent light, just as God said, "Let there be light.")

The first song is always the same and is called the starting song. Those
that follow are peyote songs. When he has finished these songs he passes
the singing staff to the right of the drummer. When this one has
finished the staff is returned to the leader, who passes it on to the
left, and then in rotation it goes to the one sitting near the door. The
drum, when it is handed on, is always passed under the staff. The fire
is always replenished, but toward midnight special care is taken in this
regard and the coals are placed in the shape of a crescent between the
fire and the earth crescent, and the fireman sweeps first around the
left and then around the right side. Then exactly at midnight the leader
calls for his singing staff and his drum, no matter where they happen to
be, and, taking the singing staff and sending the drum to the drummer,
he blows his flute and sings. The song he sings then is called the
midnight song. After that three peyote songs are sung, it making no
difference which they are. As the leader starts his midnight song the
fireman takes up his position at the doorway opposite the fireplace and
the leader. When the second song is started the fireman turns around to
the right and goes out and gets water and soon comes back with it. When
he reenters he makes the figure of a cross on the ground where he stood
just before he left and places water on it. Then he squats down on his
knees.

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

When the leader stops singing he walks to the crescent by the fireplace
and begins praying again. After the prayer he burns some more cedar
needles. The reason for drinking water at midnight is because Christ was
born at midnight and because of the good tidings that he brought to the
earth, for water is one of the best things in life and Christ is the
savior of mankind. After the leader has made his prayer and the cedar is
burned, then the fireman reaches over toward the smoke and makes a
motion with his body as if he were drawing the smoke over himself. He
then takes the water and brings it over to the leader. The leader takes
a bunch of feathers and, dipping it into the water, sprinkles it on the
peyote, then on the fire, on the sage, and finally all over the lodge,
beginning with the doorway and then going around. The water is then
drunk in a regular order, first by the leader, then by the drummer, and
then by all the other people. After all these things have been done the
leader returns the staff to the man from whom he had taken it at
midnight. As soon as this man starts the singing again the leader takes
his flute and goes outside. He goes toward the east for a short
distance, and there he sits down and offers up a prayer for the people.
Then he blows his flute, and going to the south of the lodge repeats the
same procedure. This is also repeated for the west and the north. When
the singing within the lodge has stopped, he returns and takes his seat.

The purpose of going to the four directions and blowing the flute is to
announce the birth of Christ to all the world.

After the leader has reentered the singing continues as before. At
daybreak the fireman fixes the fire in the same way as at midnight. The
staff, drum, etc., is now passed to the leader, who as soon as he has
received everything takes his flute and blows on it. Before doing this,
however, he puts on his otter-skin cap. The purpose of blowing the flute
just at that time is to represent the trumpet of the Day of Judgment,
when Christ will appear wearing His crown in all glory. The putting on
of the otter-skin cap represents the crown.

The song used on this occasion is called the water song. After the first
song is finished the fireman opens the door and a woman enters carrying
water, which she pours over the cross which the fireman had sprinkled at
midnight. The fireman then spreads something for her to sit on, between
the water and the door.

When the leader has finished his four songs, he lays down his staff,
etc., and, taking some cedar needles, offers up a prayer of thanks, and
as he finishes he throws the cedar into the fire and sits down while the
woman gathers the smoke toward her in the same way as the fireman had
done on the previous night. Then the leader takes a drinking cup and
sends it toward the woman. The

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

fireman now rises and pours water on the impressions he had made when
drawing the cross on the earth, and the woman drinks some water from the
cup, which she then returns to the leader. The water is then returned to
her and she passes it around the lodge, beginning at the left. When it
reaches the leader again, he takes out the same cup which he had handed
to the woman and drinks out of it. The water, however, is passed on
until it reaches the door. The fireman would then take it and bring it
back to where it had been placed when first brought in. The woman rises
and goes around the fireplace from left to right, taking the water with
her. Finally the leader takes his singing staff and sings four songs.
When these songs are finished, the woman places some food just outside
the door. The fireman goes outside and brings in this food, placing it
in a line between the fire and the door. Four things are brought
in—water, corn with sweetened water, fruit, and meat. When the food is
brought in the leader puts away all the objects he had spread out before
him, which the fireman takes out of the lodge. The leader then offers up
a prayer of thanks and says grace. The four kinds of food are passed
around the lodge, beginning with the entrance, from left to right. After
they are returned they are placed in line again, only in the reverse
order from that used before. The fireman then takes them outside. While
the people are eating the door remains open.

(During the evening the leader represents the first created man, the
woman dressed up is the New Jerusalem, the bride waiting for the
bridegroom. The cup used by the leader and the woman is supposed to
symbolize the fact that they are to become one; the water represents the
God's gift, His Holiness. The corn represents the feast to be partaken
of on the Day of Judgment and the fruit represents the fruit of the tree
of life. The meat represents the message of Christ and those who accept
it will be saved.) <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md)

The above descriptions represent the Peyote cult as it was given between
1908 and 1913. It is quite clear that a definite organization exists
consisting of a unit of five positions occupied by the leader and four
helpers. No specific requirements, with the exception, of course, of
that of being a peyote eater, are associated with the right to occupy
these positions.

No specialized features have become associated with the positions of the
four helpers. As indicated before, John Rave is always the leader when
he is present, but the position of leadership can be delegated to
others. This is always of a temporary nature. It may be significant to
note that whenever delegated the leadership is always delegated to men
who have been among the first of the converts, outside of Rave's
immediate family, and who were leaders in the old

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

pagan ceremonies. In 1910 this delegation of leadership was clearly a
recent tendency, conditioned, on the one hand, by the size of the
reservation and the impossibility of Rave's being everywhere, and, on
the other hand, by Rave's frequent absence on proselytizing missions. In
1913 it had already become customary for a number of men to hold the
position of leader even when Rave was present. A further complication
was introduced when Jesse Clay began giving the peyote ceremonies in the
Arapaho manner, for he then stood in the same relation to his method of
giving the ceremony as Rave stood to the older form. As we shall see,
there was, even in 1908, a separatist movement led by Albert Hensley,
which, if it had succeeded, would have given Hensley the same leadership
that Rave enjoyed before him and that Clay subsequently acquired.
