*The Peyote Cult*, by Paul Radin, \[1925\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

### DISSEMINATION OF THE DOCTRINE

Let us now see how the ideas of Rave and Hensley were transmitted in the
tribe itself, who the first and the later converts were, in what the
nature of their conversion consisted, and what they, in turn, brought to
the new cult.

The first and foremost virtue predicated by Rave for the peyote was its
curative power. He gives a number of instances in which hopeless
venereal diseases and consumption were cured by its use; and this was
the first thing one heard about it as late as 1913. In the early days of
the Peyote cult it appears that. Rave relied principally for new
converts upon the knowledge of this great curative virtue of the peyote.
The main point apparently was to induce people to try it. No amount of
preaching of its direct effects, such as the hyperstimulation induced,
the glorious visions, and the feeling of relaxation following, would
ever have induced prominent members of the old Winnebago religious
societies to try it. For that reason it is highly significant that all
the old members of the Peyote cult speak of the diseases of which it
cured them. Along this line lay unquestionably its appeal for the most
converts. Its subsequent spread was due to a large number of interacting
factors. One informant claims that there was little religion connected
with it at first, and that the people drank the peyote on account of its
peculiar effects.

The manner in which it spread at the beginning was simple and
significant—viz, along family lines. As soon as an individual had become
a peyote eater he devoted all his energies to converting other members
of his family. From instances that have come to our notice this lay in
an insistent appeal to family ties and personal affection. A man showed
unusual courtesy, showered innumerable favors upon relatives he was
anxious to convert, and thereby earned the gratitude of the recipient,
who at some critical moment, let us say, such as illness or mental
depression, showed it by partaking of the peyote. The same methods were
employed in the more general propaganda. The author knows of Peyote
people who drove many miles in order to be present at the bedside of
some old conservative who was ill, perhaps neglected by his relatives;
bring him food, and spend the night with him in the most affectionate
solicitude. They always had sufficient tact and understanding of human
nature not to obtrude their purpose on the sick man too much. To the
casual observer their object seemed simply that of a Samaritan. They
would hardly have admitted that behind all their solicitude lay the
desire to obtain a new convert. They would have claimed that their only
purpose, over and above their sincere desire to comfort the sick man,
was to demonstrate to their fellow Winnebago what changes the peyote had
wrought in them. In this way the patient drew the inference, an
inference that was likely to be drawn all the more quickly and forcibly
when he contrasted the behavior of these Peyote nurses with that of his
pagan relatives. The author was fortunate enough to obtain a fairly
complete account of a conversion, illustrating both these features.
