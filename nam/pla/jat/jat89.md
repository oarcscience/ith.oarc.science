### 87. THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD.

In olden times when anyone died they put on his moccasins, and leggings.
If he had many relatives they brought from different places, personal
property, such as shirts, leggings, blankets. With these, which were all
of the best, they dressed the body. Many people came together and
wailed. They painted the face red. The better and smaller pieces of
property were placed inside the blanket in which the body was wrapped.
The corpse was then placed on a horse which was led by two of his
kinsmen. A third man accompanied them. A grave was dug and the body
placed in it. Over the grave were placed sticks and stones. The horse
was then killed and its head cut off. All the relatives of the deceased
cut their hair. This was the way they did.
