### 57. A DUEL BETWEEN SCOUTS.

At another time they were off on a buffalo hunt. While one man was
scouting ahead for the enemy he saw one of the enemy also scouting. They
came toward each other, stood some distance apart and talked by the sign
language. They motioned that they should come near to each other. One of
them threw his arrows on the ground and held out his empty hand. Then
the other one also threw his arrows upon the ground. The enemy held up
his bow toward him and put that on the ground also. The Jicarilla held
up his bow and put it on the ground. The enemy drew his knife, showed it
to the Jicarilla, and placed it on the ground. The Jicarilla signed that
he had no knife. Then they agreed to meet in the center and to make
friends. Each said that he was without weapons. They met and commenced
to talk by signs. Soon they were fighting with their fists. The
Jicarilla was getting tired. The enemy picked him up and commenced to
carry him where his weapons were lying. The Jicarilla had a knife
suspended about his neck. As the enemy was carrying him toward his
weapons he thought about his knife, drew it and stabbed the enemy under
his arm. He dropped him and ran for his weapons. When he was close by
them he

fell and died. The Jicarilla scalped him, took all his weapons, and
carried them to his camp. Everyone was frightened and ran back to his
own country. When they came back, they made the scalp dance with it.
