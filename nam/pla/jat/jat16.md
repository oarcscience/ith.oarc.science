### 14. THE WINNING OF DAYLIGHT. <span id="fr_25"></span>[2](#fn_25)

Long ago they all gathered to play the moccasin game. <span
id="fr_26"></span>[3](#fn_26) When they arranged the wagers, daylight
was staked against darkness as a perpetual future condition. Day was
about to break. Roadrunner with his red spot did not miss the moccasin
once. Crane also guessed right every time. Roadrunner and Crane both
rubbed their cheeks with fire.

Owl took the ball from the moccasin. "It will not be day," he sang,
"who, wo." Roadrunner took the ball again. "Daylight is good," he sang,
"the east is whitening." While they were intent on the game, day broke
and they started to run to the mountains. All those who were struck by
the sun's rays became red. Roadrunner had rubbed his cheeks with fire
and that is why they are so red. Crane also burned his cheeks by rubbing
them with fire and they are red in consequence. Those were beaten who
sang, "There will be no daylight." That is why they go around at night.
Those that go around in the daytime won.
