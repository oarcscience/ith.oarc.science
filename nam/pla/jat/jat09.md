### 7. THE MONSTER FISH (Second Version).

Naiyenesgani came to the monster fish who swallowed him. As it lay in
deep water, Naiyenesgani, sat inside of him, playing. After a short
time, he cut off the heart of the monster which thereupon swam with bull
to the shore. Naiyenesgani cutting slits in the sides of its neck, went
out through the opening, taking the heart with him. The fish was thus
without a heart. When he came to his grandmother he said to her, "I will
give you this heart of the largest evil thing." That is the heart of the
fish which is held inside of the moon. His grandmother was glad because
he brought it to her and said, "I will carry it whenever the moon comes
up. They will laugh," she said, "I will carry it among the people, and
they will continually look at it as the moon rises. I will carry the
heart of the fish inside of the moon." In this manner it became the
property of his grandmother. <span id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_15"></span>[202:2](jat09.htm#fr_15) This is one of the
clearest identifications Of YoLgaiistdzan, with the moon. Certain songs
of the Mescalero mention her under the names, Esdzannadlehi, or L'ena?ai
(moon) as best suits the artistic requirement.
