### 11. THE ORIGIN OF SHEEP AND CATTLE.

Naiyenesgani went around looking in vain for monsters. When he failed to
find any he started off in this direction, toward the Mescalero country.
He climbed to the top of White Mountain and looked about in all the
different directions in vain. There were no monsters. Then he threw away
his staff. "You will get your living by means of this," he said, and
right where he threw it, it became a yucca.

Then he washed from his hands the pollution from the killing of the
monsters and threw it in different directions. "With this you will
live," he said, referring to the Mexicans. That is why sheep and cattle
have a bad odor. The dirt he washed from his hands became cattle and
sheep. All the monsters were gone. The Mescalero live upon the staff
which he threw away, the Mexicans live upon the cattle and the sheep.
That is why Mexicans have many sheep and cattle. He spoke to them this
way.
