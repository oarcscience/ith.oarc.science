### 33. COYOTE LOSES HIS EYES. <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md)

Coyote took out his eyes and threw them up. They fell back again. Some
time after, when he was walking through the woods and happened to be
under a tree, he did this. His eyes caught on the tree. He went away
again in this direction. Someone made eyes for him out of yellow pitch
and cautioned him, "You must not lie in the sunshine." Coyote, however,
did lie in the sunshine and the pitch when it became warm ran down on
each side of his nose. That is the reason Coyote has marks from each eye
down his checks. The eyes that Coyote threw into the tree became
plums. <span id="fr_52"></span>[2](#fn_52.md)
