### 19. THE BEAR-MAN.

They were living on the other side of the Rio Grande near a mountain
called Nabîanye where they were raising a crop. A bear was killing them
one by one. There at a place called Teîcnadjin, "trees thick," the bear
had his camp from which he came to get the people. They went there after
cherries. One of them, the tallest, climbed a tree to get the cherries.
The bear killed them.

They ran back away from him. They sent word to the camp and all got
ready to go after him. They followed his tracks. Here a bear had run
along. Over there, they found his coat (bearskin) which he wore when he
came after the people. He took off also the braided sticks which he wore
under his coat, as he ran to his home. They tracked him to his camp
which was by an arroyo. He had made a number of holes, in a row on the
opposite bank. Those pursuing him came there in the early morning and
stood by his door.

An old man found him. "He is like one of our people, but we will kill
him for an enemy," he said. <span id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33.md) They
brought him to the door and shot him. He had killed a bear and taken its
coat. He had cut small tough sticks and fixed them under his coat so the
arrows would not go through. They brought it home.

meant that he spoke a related language, probably Kiowa-Apache or
Mescalero.
