The Jicarilla Apache lived in what is now Northern New Mexico and
Eastern Colorado. Their name means 'Little Baskets'. Along with the
Navaho they were among the southernmost of the Athabascans. They are
grouped with the Plains indians, due to their nomadic life and reliance
on Buffalo hunting. However, a large portion of the Jicarilla occupied
mountainous areas. The animated movie 'Spirit, Stallion of the
Cimmarons', depicts the beautiful Jicarilla territory. The [official
Jicarilla Apache website](https://www.jicarillaonline.com/) \[External
Site\] has more information on the tribe.

This etext is extracted from a book of Jicarilla Apache texts collected
at the turn of the century. The first part of this book is interlinear
Apache and English, which would be difficult if not impossible to
transcribe properly into HTML. This etext consists of the second
section, which contains English translations of the texts.

The texts contain myths and legends (including many trickster stories),
stories of war and hunting, and a few ethnographic details. The stories
were collected at the close of the frontier, and Mexicans and Americans
(including Kit Carson) show up as actors in some of the historical
texts. It is important to note that at this time Plains culture had been
greatly impacted by cultural contact with Europeans.

However, these texts have all the hallmarks of genuine traditional
texts. As with many texts of traditional peoples of all continents, the
narrative style may be jarring to westerners used to a four act story
structure and a strict distinction between comedy and tragedy.
