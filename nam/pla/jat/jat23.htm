<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>Raven had the buffalo hidden they say. Then the people found out about it and went to his house. The house and Raven's children were covered with ashes and grey and dirty. The smallest child took the stone away from the opening to the lower world. Then the buffalo were in a large herd on the plain.</P>
<P>"The eyeballs and the fat between the shoulders will be mine," Raven said. "You did me a wrong. I lived on the buffalo. You took away the stone and now you have caused me to be without anything to eat. You have made me poor. I go about starving. That is why I eat whatever anybody kills," Raven said this they say.</P>
