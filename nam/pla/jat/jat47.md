### 45. HOW MOLE WON THE RACE.

All the men congregated to run a race to the border of the world where a
pretty girl was living. The one who would get there first would marry
her. They were running, along, Coyote far ahead of all the others. He
kept looking back as he ran along. The men were all running one behind
the other.

Heron started to run long after the others had set out. He ran by all
the others as they were going along a slope, and came where Mole was
running throwing a lot of dust over himself. "Where are you running?"
said Heron to Mole. "We are all running to that girl over there." "Sit
on my back," said Heron to Mole. He lay by Heron's tail who ran with him
passing everyone else. Finally, he came where Coyote was by himself, far
ahead of the others. He turned and looked back. Heron passed by him and
coming near the place put Mole down saying to him, "Hurry up now, run."
Mole came there. When Coyote and the other men came running along, Heron
said to them, "What are you running for? Mole has already married the
girl."
