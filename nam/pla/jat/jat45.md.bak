### 43. COYOTE DECEIVES A WOMAN.

They moved their camp from that place. Another girl became Coyote's
wife. "I am going off to hunt," he said, and went away. At evening, when
he came back his face and hands were covered with blood. He had caused
his nose to bleed and rubbed the blood on his face and hands. "I killed
a good many of them," he told them. "I am going to get the meat," he
said next morning and started back toward it. He came home without
anything. He had just been telling lies.
