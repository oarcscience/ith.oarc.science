### 23. THE ORIGIN OF CORN AND DEER (Second Version).

They tell of a man who went about accompanied by a small turkey. The two
went down the Rio Grande. There were four bad places for them to pass.
When they had gone down the stream, they sat by the bank.

Then the man said to the turkey, "My child, this is a nice land we have
come to. There should be some seeds." "Father, I will soon make some
corn for you. To-morrow you must level a place." Then the man levelled a
piece of ground. The turkey came to the prepared place. He ran from the
east toward it. He made black corn lie there in a row. He ran from the
south causing blue corn to lie in a row. He ran again from the west
making a row of yellow corn. Then he ran from the north and made a row
of corn of various colors. "Now, my father, you may plant it," he said.
The man planted it, scattering the seed. He raised corn and tobacco
also.

He went across the river. He saw the blazing of a fire. "Where are there
any people living?" he said to himself. The next day he went where he
had seen the fire but there were no people there. When it was dark
again, there was a fire blazing again in the same place. When he went
there the next day there were no people. He went back to his home and
when it was dark again there was a fire as before. The next day he went
there and found a woman rubbing hides in the water. She started to run
away from him but he ran right after her. She ran into the tipi and he
followed after her. Her father spoke to him, offering him tobacco from
his fawn-skin tobacco bag. He did not care to smoke and only drew on the
pipe once.

He went back to his little home. His turkey was afraid of him and would
not come near him. "You smell, my father. You do not smell as you used
to," the turkey said. <span id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_38.md) The man broke
off four ears of corn and gave them to the girl's father. He liked them
very much. He passed his tobacco bag to him. He drew on the pipe but
once.

He went back to his home. His turkey would not come near him. "You smell
bad," he said. The next day he went to visit them again,

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

carrying much corn with him. The people were glad because he brought so
much corn. Then the girl placed before him loin meat and deer meat side
by side. The young man ate the meat. He took some of the tobacco he had
raised, rolled a cigarette with corn leaves, and gave it to the old man.
"This is good," said the girl's father as he smoked it. "Why did he not
bring a large quantity of it? When he comes again he must bring
plenty." <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md) It was the girl's father
who said this. The next day he came to them again bringing a fawn-skin
bag full of tobacco. "He has done very well," said the father as he
received it.

The woman went home with the man and returned bringing much corn with
her. The young man then became her husband. They were satisfied. "We,
too, have some property," said the father-in-law, "Go and hunt with
him." His brother-in-law placed him by a black screen or blind.
Something ran toward him and passed. It was a fox. Then he placed him by
a blue blind and a wolf rain by him. "Do not shoot it," his monitor told
him. <span id="fr_40"></span>[2](#fn_40.md) Then he sat by a yellow blind
and a large panther ran by him. Finally, he placed him by a variegated
blind. "Now, make motions four times when it runs towards you." Then he
made motions four times, and shot it. "It ran off that way," he said. It
fell with its head backward. When he came to it he turned its head
toward the sun and then he butchered it. He killed it for his
brother-in-law to whom he gave the hide. His brother-in-law's wife
carried it home. <span id="fr_41"></span>[3](#fn_41.md)

Then the old man, his father-in-law, felt happy. "Now come with me and
look at my property," he said. They two went in together where the tame
deer were kept. There were very many fawns there which he had raised. He
gave all these to his son-in-law, saying, "Now these deer are all your
property, take charge of them. All the people living upon the earth will
live upon deer." The man and his wife went away and commenced living on
a hill. The woman built a fire there. All the deer gathered about her
and by the next morning had eaten all the leaves from the brush shelter.
The woman did not like it and drove them away. They came back to her,
however. This continued for four days. The woman, not liking it, took up
the poker and struck the deer with it. They had scattered the ashes all
about. She drove them far away saying, "I am tired of you." They came
back to her nevertheless. Then she was angry and hit them above the nose
with the poker. "Deer will always have a sense of smell," she said. She
drove them far away but they came back to her.

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "My mother, do not hit me, we belong to you. To
what other one can we go?" one of them said to her. "I like you my
children," she said. Then two fawns came back to her. "The time is at
hand when I shall turn you loose," she said. Nevertheless, four came
back to her. "Four times, you have destroyed my fence for me. That is
why I am going to send you away she said. "Now, my children, I send you
off." The next day four of them came back to her again. "To-day, I am
turning you loose. Go as far as you wish toward the South. I have made
you red in the summertime, blue in the fall, black in the middle of the
winter, and brown in the spring. I have made your hoofs and the ends of
your noses black. I have made your horns, your ears, your face, your
teeth, your gait, your tails, your white hips, all very pretty for you.
I have made your eyes of coals, for you to see with. Now, all I have
given you looks very well." <span id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_38"></span>[218:1](jat25.htm#fr_38.md) The man was unclean,
ceremonially at least, from his contact with the girl.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[219:1](jat25.htm#fr_39.md) In the third person
because men relations-in-law are not directly addressed.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[219:2](jat25.htm#fr_40.md) It was explained that a
bug or fly on the man's head told him what to do. This is a common
source of information in Southwestern myths.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[219:3](jat25.htm#fr_41.md) The deer was placed on
piñon, pine, oak and mixed bunches of limbs for butchering. The person
for whom the hunting is done receives the hide and half the meat.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[220:1](jat25.htm#fr_42.md) This myth is the
foundation of the deer-hunting ceremony. The substance of it, embodied
in songs, is sung before a hunt.
