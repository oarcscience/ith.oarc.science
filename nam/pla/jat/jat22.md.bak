### 20. RELEASING THE BUFFALO. <span id="fr_34"></span>[2](#fn_34.md)

Long ago, they were camping about over on the plain without food. They
were playing the hoop and pole game. Raven came from nobody knew where
and took off his quiver. Inside of the quiver were intestines.

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Magpie took them out. They watched Raven to see
which way he would start home. When it was evening he started off flying
up toward the sky-hole. "You must all watch him," they said to each
other. Everyone was looking at him. He kept circling about until he
became very small and few could see him. When he was so far off that no
one else could see him, Rattlesnake and Bat still could make him out.
When he was at the top of the sky and out of sight, he flew across this
way to the east where. the Black Mountains range from north to south.
When he reached them he went to the junction of canyons. Only the two
could see him.

The people moved their camp four times before they came to him. They
found he had very much meat there which he (Raven) distributed to the
people. They asked him about the buffalo but he would not tell them.
Then they changed an Apache into a puppy, making eyes for him of black
obsidian. They hid him under a brush bed and moved their camp away.

The children of Raven came around the deserted camp and finding the dog,
took him up. Raven's smallest child folded his arms about him and
carried him home. His father said to the children, "He was lying there
to find out something." The child did not want to give up the dog. The
father put the poker in the fire and when it was burning brought it near
the dog's eyes. After a while he cried, Wau." "You may keep it, its only
a dog. It does not know anything," the father said. "It's name will be
înôldî (choke)," said the child.

Raven had the buffalo all shut up. He opened the door when he wanted to
kill some of them. That was the way he secured the meat. The dog went
along with them and they fed it. When it was dark and they had all gone
to bed, the dog went over there and opened the door. The buffalo started
out. They had nearly all gone out before Raven noticed it. He ran over
there with his quiver, shooting at them as they rail past. When all his
arrows were gone but one, he looked at the door for the man who had
become a dog. There was an old buffalo going out which could hardly get
to its feet. The man caught hold of this buffalo and went out with it
clinging to the opposite side. Raven paid no attention to it and stood
there holding his bow with the one arrow looking for the man in vain.

The man overtook the others who had moved their camp away, "I turned the
buffalo all loose," he told them. They turned back, moving their camp to
the buffalo, where they killed many of them and were no longer hungry.

Raven told his children, "You will live on the meat that is left on the
backbone and on the eyeballs."

Long ago they were hungry but he let the buffalo out and then they had
plenty to eat. That way he did.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_34"></span>[212:2](jat22.htm#fr_34.md) In the version obtained
by Russell, (a), p. 259, many other animals are released. This story
seems not to be known to the Western Apache and the Navajo. The
Mescalero say that Coyote failed and Naiyenesgani succeeded in inducing
the buffalo to leave the lower world.

The Blackfoot have a somewhat different version of this myth. Wissler
and Duvall, pp. 50-53. The Gros Ventre do not appear to connect Raven
with the retention of the buffalo, an old woman and her daughter being
mentioned. Kroeber, (a), p. 65.
