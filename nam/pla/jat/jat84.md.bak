### 82. CEREMONY FOR BUFFALO.

They bring the medicineman buffalo manure. He makes a level place on the
ground. The men being called, come together. Then he scatters down some
pollen and strews L'ectcîc toward it and prays. He sings four times and
then stops. From over there the buffalo bellow. The buffalo manure
stands on edge and moves itself and shakes off the L'ectcîc. All the
people believe it is true and pray, saying, "May the buffalo be near us.
May we camp there among them. May there be much there to eat. With
plenty of meat may we move our camp back to our own country."

This is the way they do when there are no buffalo. From there they go
back, carrying the meat with them to their own country. This is the way
they do.
