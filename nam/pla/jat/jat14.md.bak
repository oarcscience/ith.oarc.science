### 12. NAIYENESGANI TAKES HIS LEAVE.

Naiyenesgani, when he was about to go away, came here to the center
where the heart of the world lies. When he had brought the people
together he asked them concerning that by which people should live.
Standing there at the center of the world, with his black flint armor
blowing out from him in the four directions, he said, "Now try your
supernatural power on me." Then the men who knew magic tried their
powers but the bad missiles fell all about him. When he blew his breath
towards them they fell. "You see you can do nothing with them. People
will not live by means of such things as these," he said.

Then he put the bear in charge of all the insects and of all kinds of
fruit. He gave marten (?) the care of the yuccas, chokecherries, and
corn. He placed one of the small squirrels in control of blackberries,
strawberries, and small fruits. Grasshopper was given grain. He assigned
the amole to black tail deer. "These are the things by means of which
people will live," he said.

"The heart of the world lies here. Wherever you may wander you will come
back to this place," he told them. "I am going away now to my
grandmother. I have already rid the world of monsters for you. In the
future, when the people have become few, I will come back to you that we
may all die together. I made this world as it lies here quite strong for
you. For that reason you shall live here on this world."

He made this river, the Rio Grande, its backbone. He made a mountain

ridge for its neck and Pike's Peak for its head. He made the Sangro de
Christo Range one of its legs and the mountains on the west side of the
river the other leg. White Flint Mountain is one of its nipples, and
Rock Bell Mountain the other. He made the world very strong. <span

"You shall live right here," he told them. "If they take you away from
this place, to another, where the surroundings are not your own, you
will perish." <span id="fr_21"></span>[2](#fn_21.md)

We are dying off because the Americans have taken us to a place not our
own and have forced us to live by means not ours. They have taken us
away from the world which our father made for us to live in and we are
dying in consequence. Some of the Indians who are intelligent do not
like it. We are dying every summer. When we were living in our own
country the people did not die as they do now.

Having talked to them in this manner he went away to his
grandmother. <span id="fr_22"></span>[3](#fn_22.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_20"></span>[206:1](jat14.htm#fr_20.md) Naiyenesgani made the
world of the body of YoLgaiistdzan his grandmother, and it is probably
the chief object of worship among the Jicarilla. This information was
suppressed by the informant but supplied later by Edward Ladd who is an
excellent authority.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[206:2](jat14.htm#fr_21.md) This addition to the
myths, of material pertinent to modern conditions, is evidence of the
vitality and freedom of religion among the Jicarilla. The same views in
nearly the same form were given by two other old men. They hold that
there is a definite cause for the evils which have come upon the tribe.
They have been removed from that portion of the earth where the sacred
rivers and mountains, filled with supernatural power for their help,
were situated. There is no remedy, for it is a fate foretold long ago.
YoLgaiistdzan and her grandson, while powerless are not unsympathetic;
they will return to share the fate of extinction.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[206:3](jat14.htm#fr_22.md) The Navajo locate the
present home of Estsanatlehi in the western ocean, but Naiyenesgani and
his brother live at the mouth of the San Juan, Matthews, pp. 133-134.
