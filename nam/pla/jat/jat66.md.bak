### 64. PESITA IS SHOT.

Long ago, they came to Cimarron for rations. Pesita <span
id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79.md) and another Indian commenced shooting at
each other without the knowledge of the other Indians. The other man was
shot in the shoulder with an arrow and was killed. The Ollero came
running close to Pesita's tipi from all sides. They shot at each other.
Pesita was hit with a musket ball and shot through the thigh. He fell
right there. They stopped shooting and the Ollero ran off west to their
own country. Afterwards Pesita gave them a good horse and they made
friends.

They came again for rations and fought with the Americans. One Indian
was shot through the flesh of his arm and another was shot through the
chest, from side to side. We surrounded the house but the American agent
did not want to fight and we did not shoot at each other.

Afterward there was shooting again at the same place. One Indian was
killed and another was caught and put in jail. We rode there on
horseback. One man rode in front of us by himself. He rode right up
where the Americans were in line. When he was near, his horse was killed
and he started back on foot. They shot at him. He went slowly but was
not hit. He got away from them. We rode up and surrounded them but they
did not want to fight. They gave the man they had in jail back to us so
we did not fight. When we had gone home the soldiers came to us and made
peace.

After that, rations were issued again and the meat was being given out.
He gave the bones to two men. One of them struck the Agent with the
bone. <span id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_80.md) They shot him through the
flesh of the arm. They shot there inside. Then the Agent ran into his
house. After a while, the Agent came out; he had been shot in his hand.
They ran toward us and we started toward them. We were going to shoot
but they did not attack us.

very little meat on it.
