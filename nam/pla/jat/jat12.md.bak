### 10. THE TRAVELING ROCK.

A large number of the people started away, camping. They discovered the
enemy who came together in large numbers on the plains and surrounded
them. They made a barricade of their goods and commenced to fight. The
enemy came straight at them. When they were near, they fought with
knives. The women fought too, drawing the bows this way with their feet.
Putting the bow over one foot, the woman drew the string with both hands
and shot at the enemy. Nearly all were killed. Many of the enemy also
were killed. A few of the Jicarilla escaped and returned to their own
country. Another generation grew up from these. When they were again
numerous, they started away to camp in the plains. Again, the enemy
discovered them and came together. They fought with them again until
only a small hand was left. Many of the enemy were also killed. Those
who escaped came again to their own country. Another generation grew up
and there were many men again.

The stone which rolls around came among them and killed many of the
people. It went among those who were camping over on the plain and
killed many of them. It came among the people who were living on the
east side of the. Rio Grande. Naiyenesgani tried to head it off but he
could not get around it to shoot. When it was nearly on the people he
got in front of it. It passed right through them. Again he got in front
of it and once more it came among the people. When he got in front of it
this time he shot it, hitting it in the backbone. It still lies over by
Picuris with its mouth open. It is a blue stone that has a white stripe
across its breast. They cut off this white material which shows on the
surface. When one gets sore from wearing the medicine string about his
body, he puts some of this on and be gets well. If one gets shot with an
arrow he gets well at once by the aid of this. The Picuris and other
Pueblo Indians scrape this off and use it for their medicine also.
