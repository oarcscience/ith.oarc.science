### 1. THE EMERGENCE. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

In the beginning, the people were coming up. He <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) made a mountain that continued to increase
in height. Then he caused reeds to stand vertically in the center. The
people were gathered about the mountain, watching. When the reeds were
approaching the sky, four girls went up the mountain and twisted them.
They went down and left them in this condition. The people tried in vain
to make the reeds grow. "Go up and see what has happened to them," he
told someone. This person, on ascending the mountain, found the reeds
were twisted and that those who had done it had gone down. The
messenger, when he came down, said, "The reeds are twisted."

Then four ladders were made and placed in position: <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) one black, one blue, one yellow, and one
variegated. Then whirlwind went to the world above and looked. When he
came back he reported that there was much water there. <span
id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md)

After a time, the one in charge, told Beaver to go and see how
conditions were. When Beaver got to the upper world, he found the water
receding and commenced piling dirt in front of it to retain it. When
Beaver did not

return, Badger was told to go after him and see what had happened. He
found Beaver building a dam in front of the water. "When the people come
up and the children are dying of thirst, they will drink this," said
Beaver in explanation of his conduct. Badger went into the mud
(producing certain markings). The two went down and reported that the
land was already exposed.

The people prepared to ascend. The black ladder was placed in position
and the people went up by means of it until it was worn out. The blue
ladder was next put in place. When it was worn out the yellow ladder was
put up. By the time it was worn out nearly all the people had gone up.
Last of all, the variegated ladder was placed in position. When the last
of the people had gone up it, too, was worn out. There remained behind a
feeble old woman and an old man. The people went away and left them
sitting there. "Take us out," one of them called after them. The people
stopped and looked back at the couple but did not take them out. Then
one of them said, "You will come back here to me." <span
id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md)

Then the people moved away towards the east along four parallel trails
under four chiefs. Those who went by the first road had fighting. Those
going along the second road were fortunate and came back without having
had a fight. The people who had gone by the third road, having had a
fight, returned. The fourth man came back without having had any
trouble. The leadership of the chief of the first band was unfortunate,
that of the second band fortunate, that of the third band unfortunate,
and that of the fourth band fortunate. They moved back to their own
country near Taos.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[193:1](jat03.htm#fr_0.md) This account is much
abbreviated, Mooney's version speaks of four mountains of the four
colors; and explains that the girls were picking berries and flowers and
that their mere presence caused the mountains to stop growing. He
mentions, Polecat, Crow (Raven), in addition to Beaver and Badger as
messengers sent. In each case peculiar markings resulted. Mooney, (a).
p. 197.

Russell tells that the mountains grew during four nights; that the girls
who caused them to stop growing became rabbits; that Badger and Turkey
were the messengers; that the whirlwind dried up the water; and that one
old woman remained behind from choice. Russell, (a), p. 254.

Compare also, Matthews, pp. 63-76; Franciscan Fathers, pp. 351-2.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[193:2](jat03.htm#fr_1.md) The person who did this
was Xastc'iniLgaiyîn, White god of the east, assisted by
Xastc'inyaLkîdn, Talking god of the south, Xastc'inîLtsôyin, Yellow god
of the west, and Xaste'inîdlôyin, Laughing god of the north. This was
the order in which they were mentioned. It is usual to associate
Xastc'inyaLkîdn with the east. Cf. p. 265.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[193:3](jat03.htm#fr_2.md) It was explained that two
of the ladders were made of elkhorns with four horns on each side for
rails and separate horns for the, rounds. The other two ladders were of
buffalo horn.

The continual reoccurrence of the number four, the objects or incidents
being usually associated with the cardinal points and their appropriate
colors is characteristic of the myths and ceremonies of the southern
Athapascan.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[193:4](jat03.htm#fr_3.md) Black Whirlwind caused
the water to dry up.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[194:1](jat03.htm#fr_4.md) These two are the rulers
of the world of the dead which the ghosts reached through the place of
emergence. They pass down easily but cannot return because the ladders
are worn out. This place is said to be situated somewhere many miles
north of Taos and is reached by four trails. Compare, Russell, (a), p.
255.

The Navajo tell of the death of a hermaphrodite twin afterward seen
sitting in the lower world who became the ruler of the ghosts, Matthews,
p. 77 and note 50.
