### 36. COYOTE AND BEAVER PLAY TRICKS ON EACH OTHER.

Coyote, as he was traveling, came to the shore of a large lake where he
lay down and went to sleep. Beaver coming there, took him out to the
center of the lake where he woke him up. Coyote started to swim to the
shore but when he had gone a little way, gave it up, and came back.
Beaver, swimming around him, forced him toward the shore. Coyote
continued to turn back and Beaver to force him on, until he finally
reached the shore where he came out of the water nearly dead.

He walked along keeping watch until he found Beaver sleeping on the
shore of the lake. Coyote, taking him on his back, carried him far from
the water where he woke Beaver. Beaver started back to the water,
hitching himself along. Coyote kept running about him as he crawled
along. When Beaver got back to his home, he was nearly dead and had the
skin all worn from his hands.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_55"></span>[231:1](jat37.htm#fr_55.md) This statement lacks
connection. The full story explains the shortening of Wildcat's nose and
the lengthening of Coyote's, the one operating on the other while
sleeping.
