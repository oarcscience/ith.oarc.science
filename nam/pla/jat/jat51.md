### 49. FLICKER DESCRIBES HIMSELF.

"My name is Gose 'flicker.' I eat with my long bill. I fly with my wings
which are red underneath. My legs are blue and the borders of my eyes
are pinkish. My voice is loud and when I sing all the people hear me.
They like my voice. This is my nature," he said they say.
