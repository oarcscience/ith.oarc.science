### 6. THE MONSTER FISH. <span id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md)

A monster fish which lived in a lake swallowed anyone coming near it.
Naiyenesgani came there and was swallowed by the fish which swain to the
center of the lake and lay in deep water. Naiyenesgani, sitting inside
of the fish, began singing ceremonial songs, that the fish might move to
the shore of the lake. When he had finished his songs, he cut off the
heart of the fish which raced with him toward the shore, throwing the
smaller fish and water far away. It fell with him at the shore of the
lake. Naiyenesgani,

with his obsidian knife, cut openings in the neck of the fish through
which he went out, carrying the heart in his hand. He gave it to the
suit, saying, "Here, carry this where he cannot get it again." That is
why a fish has a series of openings on the sides of its neck. He went
home to his grandmother, YoLgaiistdzan. The firedrill had blazed up and
then died down again. <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_13"></span>[201:1](jat08.htm#fr_13.md) This exploit of
-Naiyenesgani seems not to he known to the other Southern Athapascan
tribes who consider fish and water animals taboo. Mooney's account tells
of a fish leaving the water and flying to secure its prey, (a), p. 200.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[202:1](jat08.htm#fr_14.md) This was a sign for the
grandmother of the danger or safety of Naiyenesgani. Cf. Matthews, pp.
117, 122.
