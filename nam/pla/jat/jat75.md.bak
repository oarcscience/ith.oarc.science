### 73. METHODS OF COOKING CORN.

In olden times corn was roasted in the car and afterward ground with a
metate. The meal was stirred into a pot of hot water. When cooked it was
removed from the fire and served to the company in bowls. It was eaten
from the hand.

Sometimes corn was ground without first being roasted. Wheat, after it
had been allowed to sprout, was ground. This with the corn meal was
stirred into a large pot and cooked. The corn meal was first stirred in.
The pot was then withdrawn from the fire and the ground wheat thoroughly
stirred in. It was then placed in the fire and cooked for some time.
When it was dished out for serving, sugar was added. They ate it that
way, sweetened.

Corn was sometimes cooked in water as mush. It was then poured into a
dish-like hollow made in the snow. Sometimes the mush was poured on top
of the metate. As it ran off the stone they would say to it, "Run far
off from the stone." Then the mush did not run very far from the stone
when it was so told. It was eaten with the hands. That way they ate it.
Sometimes peas and corn were mixed and cooked with the feet of deer in a
pot. When it was boiled they ate it.

Others roasted the peas and then ground them. The meal was placed in
water and made into soup. That they ate.

Sometimes wheat flour was kneaded, spread out each way and twisted. This
was buried in the ashes. The dried amole fruit was well worked up

with the hands in water. When it was soft it was taken out and placed in
the ashes. It is called LînîLî.

Some people roasted beans; these were cooked in a pot, and mush not very
thick made of them. With this soup they ate bread.
