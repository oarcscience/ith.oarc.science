### 31. COYOTE KILLS HIS OWN CHILD INSTEAD OF THE TURKEYS. <span id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md)

Coyote came where a flock of turkeys was rolling in the dust. He put
them in a sack, saying, "I am going to roll with you." When he had
rolled with them twice he carried them home. He told his children to
build a fire and then said, "You had better consider what we will do
with them." The smallest child said, "We should take them out of the
sack one at a time, wring their necks, and put them in the fire."
Another one proposed that they should all break off sticks for clubs and
stand in a circle about the fire where all the turkeys could be turned
loose. This they did. The youngest coyote rushed in where the turkeys
were scattering the ashes, with their wings and he only was killed. "Why
only the little one, the smartest. is dead." Coyote started away again.
