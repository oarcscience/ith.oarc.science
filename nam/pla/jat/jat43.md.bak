### 41. COYOTE MARRIES UNDER FALSE PRETENCES.

He came to a camp and asked that a girl be given him in marriage. The
man had said, "I will give my daughter to one who has large leg
muscles." Coyote, displaying his leg muscles, was given the girl. A
horse whinnied. "That is my horse, making the noise," Coyote said. After
they had stayed there sometime they prepared to move the camp. "I am
going to get my horse," Coyote told them. His wife's family still
remained there while the others moved away. When Coyote did not return,
those who remained started and went to the other camp. "My horse came
this way," said Coyote, as he ran out toward them. "A panther skin
saddle blanket was on him and the halter and bridle of rope were
dragging." <span id="fr_63"></span>[2](#fn_63.md)
