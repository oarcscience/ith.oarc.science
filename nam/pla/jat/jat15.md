### 13. NAIYENESGANI TAKES HIS LEAVE (Second Version).

Naiyenesgani came to the rock that was rolling over people. It rolled
away from him and he could not overtake it to kill it. After trying for
some time to pass it, he succeeded in getting ahead of it and shooting
it. Before he killed it he said, "What shall I do with you who swallow
people?" Killing it, he said, "This is what I do with bad people, I kill
them." He did not go up to it nor did he cut it. <span

"Now I will go and look for other bad things," Naiyenesgani said. "Wait
for me, my friend." Then four of them started away toward the east. They
climbed one of the sacred mountains and looked around without finding
anything. After that, they came to Balgai, another mountain, which they
climbed. When they had looked about without finding anything,
Naiyenesgani said, "There are no bad things. Now, we will go back. He

threw all the yucca stalks back of him, saying, "People will live on you
right here." <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md) The name of this
mountain will be Balgai." Then they started back and taking only four
steps, they reached Taos.

"Do you like it?" he asked the people. "I have killed for you all the
monsters which were in the world. That is why my name is,
'Monsters-he-kills'. Are you all pleased?" "Yes," they replied. "I made
these things which are on the earth so that you may like them. I have
made everything that you will eat; the berries, amole fruit, and plums.
Are you satisfied? I made all these for you when you were poor and had
nothing. Are you pleased with all these fruits I have made for you."
"They are very good, my grandson," she said. "You will eat them every
summer. I do not wish that you shall live on these things all the time
because I am not going to talk about them for you always."
