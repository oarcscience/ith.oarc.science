### INCENSE AND THE PIPE.

When the Conductor ceased singing this song he entered the lodge and sat
at the *catku*. He then filled and lighted a pipe in the formal manner
and handed it to the Assistant, who smoked and passed it to the younger
man, who also smoked and passed the pipe. It was passed until all in the
lodge had smoked in communion, the Conductor smoking last. He emptied
the residuum in the pipe carefully beside the *catku* and said, "The
grandfather, the father, and the sons are with us. The Earth and the
Buffalo are in this lodge. We have smoked together as friends, and the
spirit of the pipe has gone up to the Great Spirit. I will now make
incense to drive away the evil powers." The meaning of this address is
that all the Gods above the world were with them and that those on the
world, the Earth and the Buffalo, were in the lodge; that the potency of
the mediating

God, *Wohpe*, which abides in the smoke of the pipe, had gone from all
in the lodge to the Great Spirit and would propitiate Him. ,

The Conductor then handed the fire carrier to the Assistant and the
counting rod to the Recorder, and commanded the Assistant to bring fire.
He brought burning coals and placed them together on the fireplace,
using the fire carrier to handle the fire. The Conductor then made
incense by first sprinkling sage and then sweetgrass on the fire. While
he was doing this, the Assistant arranged the buffalo skull on the
altar, propping it up with the stone that had been placed beside the
altar, so that it faced the *catku*.. Then the Conductor filled the
ceremonial pipe with *cansasa*, and the Assistant brought a burning coal
on the fire carrier and held it so as to light the pipe. The ceremonial
pipe is lighted in this formal manner in order that the potency of the
sun, which abides in the fire, may be with the potency of the mediator,
which abides in the smoke of the pipe. As the Conductor smoked the
ceremonial pipe be said, "Grandmother, you have not taken the horns from
this skull. The spirit of the buffalo still watches for *Anpeo*. We will
honor these horns."

The Shamans usually addressed the Goddess, the Earth, as Grandmother, It
was taught that when the horns fall from the dried skull of a buffalo
this Goddess has taken them from it; that the spirit of the buffalo
abides in the skull as long as the horns remain on it; that the spirit
of the buffalo is as one with the God, the Buffalo; that the God, the
Buffalo is the comrade of the God, the Sun, and is most pleased when in
His light. *Anpeo* is the *akicita*, or forerunner, of the sun. It is
the red aurora. With this explanation the allusive meaning of the
address may be comprehended.
