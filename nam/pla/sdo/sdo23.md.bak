### CAPTURE OF THE TREE.

On the second holy day, after the escort has driven evil beings from the
camp and the Superior has formally greeted the Sun, the red herald
should proclaim that the people form for the procession of the Bear God.
Then a procession should form and march as on the previous day, but it
should be done without levity. When the procession disperses, the
Superior should command the red herald to proclaim that the hunter has
reported that an enemy is near the camp. He then should command the
escort to go in search of the enemy and if found take him captive. The
escort, and those who wish to join them, should search all about in the
vicinity of the camp,

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

as if looking for signs of an enemy. Soon they should return and report
to the Superior that no signs of an enemy have been found. The Superior
should command them to go and search again, and they should do as
before. This is repeated until the fourth time, when the escort finds
the Sacred Tree. They should surround it, jeering and taunting it, and
then rush upon it, strike it, and bind a thong about it.

When they have done this they should return to the camp singing a
victory song and shouting like victorious returning warriors. The people
should greet their return with songs and shouts of joy and the women
should ululate shrilly. The escort should report to the Superior that
the enemy has been found and made captive and the herald should proclaim
this to the people who should rejoice and shout and sing warrior songs.
The Superior should then command the red herald to proclaim the
formation of the procession that is to bring the enemy into the camp.
The procession should be formed with the Superior and Mentors leading,
followed by the escort, the mothers bearing babes whose ears are to be
pierced, the children whose parents wish thus to honor them, the women
who are to chop the Sacred Tree, and finally, the people. The procession
should go, if practicable, so as to cross running water at its second
pause. At about one fourth the distance to the Sacred Tree, the Superior
should halt and light a pipe and all should wait until he has smoked a
few whiffs. Then the procession should move on until one half the
distance is covered; there again the Superior should halt as before, and
if there is running water there he should strike it four times with his
Fetish, to drive from it the *Mini Watu*, or evil water creatures that
can infect the people. Again, at three fourths the distance all should
halt as before. Then the procession should go to the tree and surround
it. Now the Superior may harangue the people and should proclaim aloud
four times the name of some reputable man, preferably one who is
renowned for war deeds. The one so named should come forward and take
the chopper and may recite the deeds that make him eligible to strike
the Sacred Tree. When he has done so, he should strike the Sacred Tree
on the west side four times with the chopper, and if he can do so, leave
the chopper sticking in the tree. This should be repeated until four men
have struck the tree, each four times, first on the west, then the
north, then the east, and then on the south. The *nagila* of the tree is
thus subdued and made subservient to the people.

When this is done, the children who are to be honored are placed in
line, and the herald, beginning at one end of the line should call the
names of the children successively as they stand, and when a name is so
called those wishing to honor the child should come forward and give it
presents. When this is done, the Superior should command that the Sacred
Tree be felled. Then the women appointed to chop the Sacred Tree should
do so, relieving

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

each other so that all may have a chance. When the tree is about to fall
the woman chosen to fell it should strike the last blows that cut it
down. As the tree falls, the people should sing and shout and ululate
for joy because it is now their servant. To ululate one should utter a
prolonged sound in high or falsetto key, patting the lips with the
fingers while doing so. This is an expression of intensity of emotion.

When the tree is down it should be trimmed and the bark peeled from it
to its smaller end. The bark should be left on the fork at the smaller
end. This is the Sacred Pole. Pregnant women, and women who have young
babes will eagerly gather the twigs that are trimmed from the tree, for
they are powerfully effective against *Anog Ite*.

After the Superior pronounces the pole Sacred, it should not be touched
by hands that are not painted red. Then it should be carried to the camp
in the following manner:--A sufficient number of carrying sticks should
be placed under it and the carriers should lift it on these without
touching it with their hands and carry it, butt forward, toward the
camp. When about one fourth the distance to be carried, the carriers
should halt and lay the Sacred Pole on the ground. Then they should howl
like wolves, for this is the cry of returning warriors who come bringing
a captive. Then another relay of carriers should lift and carry the pole
in the same manner to half the distance, where they should lay it down
and howl as did the first relay. Then another relay should carry it in
the same manner as before, to three fourths the distance, where they
should lay it down and howl.

Then the messenger race should be run in this manner:--The young men who
desire to run this race should stand side by side in a line at the
Sacred Pole, and starting at a signal should race for the Sacred Spot.
The first to place his hand on the Sacred Spot; or in the hole for the
erection of the Sacred Pole is thereby entitled to carry a red coup
stick, or a banner of feathers. A runner in this race should obstruct
his competitors in any manner he can. Thus a runner in this race may be
seriously injured by a blow or a fall.

After the race of the messengers the fourth relay of carriers should
lift and carry the pole as before, taking it through the entrance to the
camp circle and into the Dance Lodge, where they should lay it down with
the forked end toward the east and the butt at the hole prepared for its
erection. It should be so placed that when it is erected it will follow
the course of the Sun. When the Sacred Pole is laid in the Dance Lodge
the people may disperse, but the Superior and Mentors should then mix
the paints and fats supplied with the equipment, and they, or others,
whose hands are painted red, should paint the Sacred Pole, so that its
west side will be red, its north blue, its east green, and its south
side yellow.

The fork of the pole should not be painted and the paint should be so

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

applied to the body of the pole that when erect the opening of the fork
will be toward the west and east. While others are painting the Sacred
Pole one of the Mentors should cut from the dried buffalo skins without
hair, provided with the equipment, the figures of a bull buffalo and of
a man, each with exaggerated genitals, and painted black. When the
Sacred Pole is painted, all but the Superior, Mentors, and Shamans
should be excluded from the Dance Lodge. Those remaining should sit in a
circle around the black images, and by incantation, impart to the image
of a man the potency of *Iya*, the patron God of libertinism, and to the
image of the buffalo the potency of *Gnaski*, the Crazy Buffalo, the
patron God of licentiousness. When thus prepared, these images should be
carefully wrapped and bound so as to restrain them until they are
elevated.

When the people disperse from the Dance Lodge the societies may give
feasts, one or more at the same time, but all should unite in feasting.
During this feast, each society should be grouped, and each served by
its women folks before the people are served. After feasting, each
society may dance its dances and such others as the regulations of the
society will permit, may dance with them. These festivities may continue
far into the night, but they should cease while the Superior greets the
Sun as He disappears from sight.

When it is dark that night the Superior and Mentors should again go in
procession about the camp for the same purposes as on the previous
night, and then visit the Candidates in the Sacred Lodge. This completes
the formalities of the second holy day.
