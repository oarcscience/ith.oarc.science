### INVOCATION BY A SHAMAN.

The invocation and its explanation were given in Lakota by Sword and
interpreted by Thomas Mills.

Before a Shaman can perform a ceremony in which mysterious beings or
things have a part, he should fill and light a pipe and say:--

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

"Friend of *Wakinyan*, I pass the pipe to you first. Circling I pass to
you who dwell with the Father. Circling pass to beginning day. Circling
pass to the beautiful one. Circling I complete the four quarters and the
time. I pass the pipe to the Father with the Sky. I smoke with the Great
Spirit. Let us have a blue day."

The pipe is used because the smoke from the pipe smoked in communion has
the potency of the feminine god who mediates between godkind and
mankind, and propitiates the godkind. When a Shaman offers the pipe to a
god, the god smokes it and is propitiated. In this invocation, when the
Shaman has filled and lighted the pipe he should point the mouthpiece
toward the west and say, "Friend of *Wakinyan*, I pass the pipe to you
first." Thus, he offers the pipe to the West Wind, for the West Wind
dwells in the lodge of Wakinyan and is his friend. The pipe should he
offered to the West Wind first, because the birthright of precedence of
the oldest was taken from the first born, the North Wind, and given to
the second born, the West Wind, and the gods are very jealous of the
order of their precedence.

When he has made this offering the Shaman should move the pipe toward
his right hand, the mouthpiece pointing toward the horizon, until it
points toward the north. Then he should say, "Circling, I pass to you
who dwells with the grandfather." Thus, he offers the pipe to the North
Wind, for because of an offence against the feminine god, the Great
Spirit condemned the North Wind to dwell forever with his grandfather,
who is *Wazi*, the wizard. Then the Shaman should move the pipe in the
same manner, until the mouthpiece points toward the east and should say,
"Circling pass to beginning day." This is an offering to the East Wind,
for his lodge is where the day begins and he may be addressed as the
"beginning day." Then the Shaman should move the pipe in the same manner
until the mouthpiece points toward the south, and say, "Circling, pass
to the beautiful one." This is an offering to the South Wind, for the
"beautiful one" is the feminine god who is the companion of the South
Wind and dwells in his lodge, which is under the sun at midday. It
pleases the South Wind to be addressed through his companion rather than
directly.

The Four Winds are the *akicita* or messengers of the gods and in all
ceremonies they have precedence over all other gods and for this reason
should be the first addressed.

When the offering has been made to the South Wind the Shaman should move
the pipe in the same manner until the mouthpiece again points toward the
west, and say, "Circling I complete the four quarters and the time." He
should do this because the Four Winds are the four quarters of the
circle and mankind knows not where they may be or whence they may come
and the pipe should be offered directly toward them. The four quarters
embrace all that are on the world and all that are in the sky.
Therefore, by circling the pipe, the offering is made to all the gods.
The circle is the symbol of time, for the daytime, the night time, and
the moon time are circles above the world, and the year time is a circle
around the border of the world. Therefore, the lighted pipe moved in a
complete circle is an offering to all the times.

When the Shaman has completed the four quarters and the time he should
point the mouthpiece of the pipe toward the sky and say, "I pass the
pipe to the father with the sky." This is an offering to the Wind, for
when the Four Winds left the lodge of their father, the Wind, he went
from it. and dwells with the sky. He controls the seasons and the
weather, and he should he propitiated when good weather is desired,

Then the Shaman should smoke the pipe and while doing so, should say, "I
smoke with the Great Spirit. Let us have a blue day."

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

To smoke with the Great Spirit means that the one smoking is in
communion with the Great Spirit. Then he may make a prayer. The prayer
here is for a blue day. Ordinarily, a blue day means a cloudless or
successful day. When a Shaman formally prays for a blue day, it means an
enjoyable day and an effective performance of a ceremony.
