### THE CONCEPT NI.

(By Sword.)

A man's *Ni* is his life. It is the same as his breath and that which
gives him his strength. It is the *Ni* which keeps the inside of a man
clean. If the *Ni* is weak, he cannot perform this office and if it goes
away the man dies. *Niya* is the ghost or spirit which is given to a man
at birth and is that which causes the *Ni*. The Lakota have a ceremony
which they call *Ini kaga* or *Inipi*. The white people call it taking a
sweat bath. The idea of the Lakota is that the *Inipi* makes man's
spirit strong so that it may cleanse all within the body and so that the
*Ni* may drive from his body all that makes him tired or that causes
disease or that causes him to have evil thoughts. The ceremony must be
performed in a *ini ti* or what the white people call a sweatlodge. The
*ini ti* must be made according to Lakota custom; otherwise, the
ceremony would be of no avail.

Wowihanble is the name for a supernatural communication. It is what the
white people call a holy dream or vision. In former times, if a man
wished to know the will of his god he sought a vision. The term for this
is *ihanblapi*. To seek such a vision a Lakota must think about it all
the time, but first strengthen his spirit by the *inikaga*.
