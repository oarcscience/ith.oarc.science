### RITES OF THE BUFFALO SKULL.

When the Conductor had thus addressed the younger man he filled and
lighted the ceremonial pipe as before, blew smoke from it into the
nostril cavities of the buffalo skull on the altar, and then gave the
pipe to the younger man, saying, "Smoke with the spirit of the buffalo,
for you are now as its brother. He will help you that you may have
plenty of meat and hides."

As the younger man smoked the pipe, the Conductor removed the skull from
the stone that supported it, placed a splotch of red paint on the stone,
and then said, "We will smoke with the Rock." He took the pipe and blew
smoke from it against the stone. He then gave the pipe to the younger
man who also blew smoke on the stone. While he was doing so the
Conductor said, "You have smoked with the Rock and He will make you
strong so that you will not quickly grow weary." The Shaman then took
the pipe and said, "We will smoke with our Grandmother." He then blew
smoke from the pipe upon the altar and gave the pipe to the younger man
who did likewise. The Conductor said, "We have smoked with the Earth and
She will provide us with all things."
