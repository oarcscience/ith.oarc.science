<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE CONCEPT NI.</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(By Sword.)</P>
<P>A man's <I>Ni</I> is his life. It is the same as his breath and that which gives him his strength. It is the <I>Ni</I> which keeps the inside of a man clean. If the <I>Ni</I> is weak, he cannot perform this office and if it goes away the man dies. <I>Niya</I> is the ghost or spirit which is given to a man at birth and is that which causes the <I>Ni</I>. The Lakota have a ceremony which they call <I>Ini kaga</I> or <I>Inipi</I>. The white people call it taking a sweat bath. The idea of the Lakota is that the <I>Inipi</I> makes man's spirit strong so that it may cleanse all within the body and so that the <I>Ni</I> may drive from his body all that makes him tired or that causes disease or that causes him to have evil thoughts. The ceremony must be performed in a <I>ini ti</I> or what the white people call a sweatlodge. The <I>ini ti</I> must be made according to Lakota custom; otherwise, the ceremony would be of no avail.</P>
<I><P>Wowihanble</I> is the name for a supernatural communication. It is what the white people call a holy dream or vision. In former times, if a man wished to know the will of his god he sought a vision. The term for this is <I>ihanblapi</I>. To seek such a vision a Lakota must think about it all the time, but first strengthen his spirit by the <I>inikaga</I>.</P>
