# TRANSLATIONS OF TEXTS.

In the following will be found close renderings of texts and
conversations upon important concepts referred to in the preceding
discussions. The author has prepared for publication a number of texts
with both literal and free translations which it is hoped may, be
printed in the near future. These all deal with ceremonies and mythical
concepts.
