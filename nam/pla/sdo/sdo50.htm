<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">WAKAN TANKA.</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(By Sword.)</P>
<P>When <I>Wakan Tanka</I> wishes one of mankind to do something he makes his wishes known either in a vision or through a shaman.. . . The shaman addresses <I>Wakan Tanka</I> as <I>Tobtob Kin</I>. This is part of the secret language of the shamans.. . . . <I>Tobtob Kin</I> are four times four gods while <I>Tob Kin</I> is only the four winds. The four winds is a god and is the <I>akicita</I> or messenger of all the other gods. The four times four are: <I>Wikan and Hanwikan</I>; <I>Taku Skanskan</I> and <I>Tatekan</I> and <I>Tob Kin</I> and <I>Yumnikan</I>; <I>Makakan</I> and <I>Wohpe</I>; <I>Inyankan</I> and <I>Wakinyan</I>; <I>Tatankakan</I>; <I>Hunonpakan</I>; <I>Wanagi</I>; <I>Waniya</I>; <I>Nagila; </I>and <I>Wasicunpi</I>. These are the names of the good Gods as they are known to the people.</P>
<P>Wakan Tanka is like sixteen different persons; but each person is <I>kan</I>. Therefore, they are all only the same as one . . . . All the God persons have ton. Ton is the power to do supernatural things . . . . Half of the good Gods are <I>ton&nbsp;ton</I> (have physical properties) and half are <I>ton&nbsp;ton sni</I> (have no physical properties). Half of those who are <I>ton&nbsp;ton</I> are t<I>on&nbsp;ton yan</I> (visible), and half of those who are <I>ton&nbsp;ton sni</I> are <I>ton&nbsp;ton yan sni</I> (Invisible). All the other Gods are visible or invisible as they choose to be . . . . All the evil Gods are visible or invisible as they choose to be . . . . The invisible Gods never appear in a vision except to a Shaman . . . . Except for the Sun dance, the ceremonies for the visible and the invisible Gods differ. The Sun dance is a ceremony the same as if <I>Wikan</I> were both visible and invisible. This is because <I>Wi</I> is the chief of the Gods. . . .</P>
