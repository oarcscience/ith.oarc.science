### THE PROCESSION OF SEX.

From dawn on the third holy day until the Sun shows His face, the same
rites should be performed as on the preceding day. Then the herald
should call the people to form the procession of sex in which children
take no part. It should form near the council lodge, the women in front
and the men behind, with an interval between the sexes. This procession
should march around inside the camp circle four times, the women with
song and speech lauding the Earth and the Feminine, while the men in the
same manner laud the Sky and the Wind. When this procession returns to
the starting place the fourth time, it should disperse, and then the
Superior and Mentors should go to the Sacred Lodge, and remind the
Candidates that they may drink, but take no food on that day.
