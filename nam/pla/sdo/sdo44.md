### RITES OF THE EAR OF CORN.

He then emptied the pipe, putting the residuum on the fire, took the ear
of corn, and thrust the rod to which it was attached, into the altar so
that the rod stood upright. He said, "Our Grandmother gave us this corn.
She sent it to the Lakota by the Buffalo woman. The South Wind came with
her. The plume is the Buffalo. These embrace the Earth and her children
are many. These things the Shaman can explain to you." He then sang this
song:--

"Hunka, Hunka, Hunks, in the west.  
The voice of Hunka, hear it."

An interpretation of this song is: the patron God of the ceremony in the
west, the Buffalo, approves the performance of this ceremony, the
younger man must heed that which is told to him and that the ceremony is
to be continued.
