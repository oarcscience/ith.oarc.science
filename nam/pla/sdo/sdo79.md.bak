### HOW BIG-FOOT GOT HIS NAME.

(Told by John Blunt-horn.)

In the moon, when the leaves fall, in the year when many stars fell, a
war party of twenty men went on the warpath against the Pawnee. A small
orphan boy wanted to go with them, but as he was only nine years old,
they refused him at first. He begged them so to go that they finally
consented, and he went with them. They were all armed with bows and
arrows except two men who had guns they had traded for with the Hudson
Bay Fur Company.

After they had made five camps, they came to a great herd of buffalo and
killed a great many. They camped at this place until they had dried the
best parts of the meat, when they continued on their warpath. One
evening, they came to a good camping place in the woods on the bank of a
creek and camped there. After they had been there a short time, one of
the men said that he had camped at this place, once before, and knew it,
and that there was a ghost dwelling here. He advised the party to move
to another place to avoid trouble from the ghost but the others of the
party ridiculed him and told him that they were not afraid of ghosts and
that if one should come they would take it prisoner and carry it back to
their friends. The little boy did not say anything but he sat and
thought about the ghost.

After they had eaten, they made a tipi of branches of the trees and
covered it with grass, and sat outside talking, but the boy sat inside
and thought about the ghost. While they were talking, they heard a sound
as if someone were singing and then something cried "Hoo-oowi" in a
mournful way. The man who had warned them of the ghost said that this
was the ghost and begged them to go away at once, but the others said
they would wait and see the ghost.

The two men with the guns were told to get them ready and if the ghost
showed itself, to fire at it and scare it away. All this time the boy
sat inside the tipi, beside the door, with his robe over his head
thinking about the ghost. Soon the sound came nearer, and the warriors
went to find what it was, but they could find nothing so they came back
to the tipi.

After a while, the sound appeared to be close to them, but they could
see nothing until the sound appeared among them when they saw a thing
like a skeleton, with a little hair left on the head and a little flesh
hanging to some of the bones. This frightened them so that they fled
into the tipi, falling over each other and piled upon one another at the
back of the tipi. Here they lay in a pile, some of them fainting and the
others hiding their faces from fear. The boy looked at them and then
turned and looked at the ghost and beckoned it to come into the tipi.

It came in and stood looking at the boy, who took a piece of the buffalo
meat, put it on a stick and placed it before the fire. When it was hot
he offered it to the ghost. The ghost took the meat. Then the boy took
some of the choice fat and

offered it and the ghost took this also. Then the boy put some fat from
the kidneys of a buffalo on a stick and placed it before the fire. While
it was getting hot, he said to the ghost, "I have given you of the best
food that we have and I want you to do something for me."

The ghost said, "What do you want? I will do it for you, if I can." The
boy said, "I want to strike an enemy; I want to be slightly wounded; and
I want to capture horses from the enemy. The ghost said, "I will help
you in these things." Then the boy gave the ghost the hot fat and it
went away crying "Hoo-oo-wi" which grew fainter and fainter until it
could not be heard.

When the ghost had gone, the boy went and pulled the warriors off each
other and brought water for those who had fainted. After all had been
restored the boy said to them, "You are like old women. You are
frightened by a friend. What will you do if an enemy should come?" Then
the warriors hid their faces and were ashamed.

The next morning when they were starting from the camp, the boy
pretended to be mending his moccasin. He told them not to wait for him
as he would overtake them. They went without him. After they were gone,
the boy went another way, for he knew where they were to camp that
night. He kept thinking of what the ghost had promised him, all the day,
and near evening, he came to a creek and saw smoke. He thought this was
from fire that his party had made, but he was puzzled for this was not
the place they had said they would camp. So he stole carefully near
where the smoke was coming from and saw that it was a camp of Pawnee and
that they had many horses. The horses were hobbled and near the camp,
but he determined to try to get some of them. So he waited until late at
night when he stripped off all his clothing and took with him only a
knife and the cord for binding his robe. He crept near the horses and
then crawled on his belly until he was among them.

The horses snorted and shied away from him. A Pawnee came to find what
was the matter and the boy curled himself about a bush of sagebrush so
that the Pawnee could not see him. The Pawnee drove the horses nearer
the camp and then went away. Again, the boy crawled among the horses.
This time he found a gentle horse which he caught and bridled with the
cord he had with him. He then untied the hobble and had enough cord to
lead the horse. He led the horse from one to another of the other
horses, driving them slowly farther from the camp all the time, and when
he could catch a horse he would untie the hobbles. When he had twenty
horses freed from their hobbles he got on the horse he was leading and
began to drive them away. As soon as he was far enough away from the
Pawnee so that he thought they would not hear him he began to drive them
as fast as possible towards his own camp. He did not get to their camp
until the morning, just as they were about to break camp and go back to
hunt for him. They were surprised to see him come with the horses, and
while they were trying to catch them the Pawnee came upon them and they
had to fight them. The boy herded the horses he had taken while his
party fought the Pawnee, until a Pawnee charged on horseback towards the
horses to stampede them. Just as he was about to do so one of the boy's
friends shot the horse the Pawnee was riding and it fell and threw its
rider near the boy. The Pawnee jumped up and drew an arrow to shoot the
boy, but the boy's friend shot the Pawnee just as he let his arrow fly.
The arrow hit the boy in the foot making a bad wound, but he rushed
forward and struck the Pawnee before the one who shot him could do so.

The Pawnee were driven away. The boy kept the horses and brought them to
the camp of his people. When the war party had returned, the boy told
the story

of the ghost and what it had promised to help him do. His wounded foot
swelled until it was very large. To give him a new name for the brave
thing he had done, the people called him Big-foot. Big-foot was a brave
warrior and the chief of a band. He was killed by the white soldiers at
Wounded Knee, on the Pine Ridge Reservation.
