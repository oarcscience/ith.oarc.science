### THE WIZARD AND HIS WIFE.

(Told by Hoka-chatka.)

Long ago, there was an old woman and her little grandson who were so
ragged and filthy that the people drove them from the camp and they
lived alone, far away from anyone. She was a wise woman and taught the
boy strange things so that when he was a young man, though he was still
ragged and filthy, he knew how to talk with birds and beasts and to do
magical things.

The chief had a beautiful daughter who was so beloved by all, that they
would spread their robes on the ground for her to walk upon. This young
man wanted the chief's daughter for his wife, but she scorned him
because he was so filthy. He told his grandmother what he wanted and
asked her to go to the camp and get a bladder for him. She was afraid to
go to the camp or to ask anyone for anything, for she knew the people
despised her and her grandson and that they would treat her with
contempt and might abuse her.

The young man persuaded her to go. When she was near the camp she called
to the people and asked if someone would give her a bladder. They made
sport of her and told her to keep away from the camp. She was about to
go to her tipi when a good woman gave her a bladder. She took it to her
grandson and he made a rattle of it and conjured it so that it was
magical. He then sat beside the creek where the chief's daughter came
for water and when she came and stooped to fill her vessel, she saw his
reflection in the water.

When she looked up at him, he told her he wanted her to be his wife. She
answered him by scolding and bemeaning him and calling him vile names
and ordered him to keep away from her so that she could not see him. He
then shook his magic rattle at her and she became like a rattle and
rattled at every step she made. She ran, but this only made her rattle
the louder, so she began to weep. Her friends put a robe on her and
carried her to her father's tipi and she told him of the filthy young
man who had asked her to be his wife, and had brought this evil thing on
her when she had refused.

The chief knew that the old woman had taught her grandson many wise
things and that he was a wizard so he told his daughter that this young
man and no other could relieve her of the evil upon her. He advised her
to go to the young man and

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

say that she would be his wife if he would relieve her of the spell that
was upon her and then she could run away from him.

She went to the old woman's tipi and told the young man that she had
always intended to be his wife, that what she had said to him at the
creek was just to tease him, that if he would relieve her from the evil
he had put upon her, she would be his wife. He relieved her of the evil
and told her to go back to her father's tipi and he would come there and
get her with her father's consent and take her in an honorable way,
before all the people. This pleased her, for she thought that her father
would never give his consent to such an arrangement. When she was
relieved of the evil she hurried away.

The people were gathered at her father's tipi, waiting to learn the
result of her visit to the young man and when they saw her coming,
restored to her natural condition, they shouted their joy and
congratulated her on her escape from the filthy young man. The young man
perceived that he had been tricked into restoring her and that she did
not intend to become his wife and would try to keep out of his power. He
went to the creek and hid himself near where she came for water. Soon
she came, looking cautiously about to see if he were there. At first she
did not see him, but when she stooped to fill her vessel she saw his
shadow in the water. She started to run but he shook the rattle at her
and she became dry and hard and rattled as she moved.

The people again carried her to her father's tipi and she told him what
had happened to her. He then understood that this young man was truly a
wizard and told his daughter that she could not escape him and must be
his wife. He then directed the people to go to the young man, to treat
him well and invite him to come to his tipi, and tell him that he would
give him his daughter to be his wife. They did so.

The young man came to the chief's tipi. The chief ordered three old
women to take him and cleanse him, bathe him and clothe him in good
clothing and put a new robe on him. They did so. When the young man was
cleansed and clothed in good clothing all saw that he was a strong and
handsome man and good to look upon, so they followed him to the chief's
tipi, singing and laughing joyfully.

When the chief's daughter saw him, she smiled upon him and came and put
her hand in his. He restored her to. her natural condition and wrapped
his robe about her and himself, and stood facing all the people, proud
and commanding, so that they knew that he would be a chief. The chief
then said to him, "You are a wizard, and you shall be known by that name
forever."

He then gave his daughter to the wizard to be his wife and made a great
feast and the people danced and sang and played games. The young people
made love and the old people told stories and all were happy. The old
women made a big tipi at the head of the camp, next to the chief's tipi
and. the wizard and his wife lived in it, happily for many moons.

One morning, the wizard awoke and found his wife gone. He inquired for
her in her father's tipi and in all the camp, but could not find her, so
the chief called all the people together and asked them about her, but
no one could tell where she had gone or what had become of her.

The wizard was disconsolate and wandered aimlessly about until one day
he came to his grandmother's tipi. He did not know her, but she said,
"Come into my tipi, my grandson. I have been waiting for you. Your wife
is gone and I win tell you how to find her." He went into the tipi and
his grandmother gave him food. After he had eaten and rested, she gave
him a gray bonnet and a big knife and told

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

him that when he put the bonnet on, no one could see him, and when he
struck anything with the big knife, it would be cut to pieces.

She showed him a trail and told him to follow it until he came to a lake
and then put on the gray bonnet and dive into the lake where he would
find a trail at the bottom and to go on this trail until he came to a
river. When he came to the river, she told him to put on the gray bonnet
and he could walk across the river. On the other side of the river was a
great camp and his wife was in that camp.

The wizard did as his grandmother told him and traveled on the trail
until he came to the lake where he put on the bonnet, dived into the
lake, and found the trail at the bottom. He went on this trail until he
came to a river and he put on the gray bonnet again and walked on the
water across the river. On the other side of the river he saw a great
camp and in the center of the camp he saw a large tipi. He put the gray
bonnet on, so that no one could see him and walked into the camp and
went into the big tipi in the center of the camp. Here, he found his
wife, sitting in the tipi, making moccasins. He sat down near her and
took off the gray bonnet.

She was surprised and pleased to see him and begged him to take her back
to his tipi. She begged him to go quickly for she was afraid of the one
who had stolen her and brought her there, because he was a strong and
savage beast who would try to kill both the wizard and his wife if he
found them together. The wizard told her to have no fear, for he wanted
to see this evil one who had stolen her, but she begged him so hard to
go before the beast came that he took her by the hand and led her out of
the door. As they came out of the tipi, his wife cried, "Here it comes.
It will kill both of us."

The wizard saw a great beast rushing at them and knew that it was the
Magical Buffalo (*Ganask inyan*). He put on the gray bonnet and the
Magical Buffalo could see neither him nor his wife. As it rushed by him,
he struck it with the big knife and it was cut into pieces. He and his
wife then went to the river and he put, on the gray bonnet and followed
the trail to his grandmother's tipi. They came to her tipi and found her
waiting for them, and she said, "Come into my tipi, grandson., I knew
that you would bring your wife with you." When they were in the tipi she
said to him, "Hang the gray bonnet and the big knife on the side of the
tipi, and when you are in trouble come to me." She then gave them food
and when they had rested, they went on their way to their own tipi. When
the people saw them, they rejoiced; the chief gave a great feast and all
were happy.

The wizard and his wife lived happily in their tipi for many moons. One
morning, the wizard awoke and found his wife gone again. He searched for
her in her father's tipi and in all the camp but could not find her. The
chief called the people together but no one could tell where she was or
what had become of her. The wizard remembered his grandmother and went
to her tipi and found her waiting for him She said to him, "My grandson,
you have lost your wife again. I will help you to find her."

She then gave him food. When he had rested she told him to take the gray
bonnet and the big knife and follow her. She went into a wood on the
bank of a large river where there was a log with a branch at one end.
She twisted this branch round and round and the log rolled over and over
towards the river and as it rolled became more and more like a boat, so
that when it reached the water it was a boat with a head, two great
eyes, and a tail. She told the wizard that this boat would carry him
where he wanted to go and that when he got out of it, it would sink
below the surface of the water until only its tail could be seen. She
told him that when he

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

wished to use the boat again he should shake the tail and the boat would
rise and start away. She warned him that he must get into it quickly or
it would go and leave him.

He sat in the boat and it carried him all day. At night he lay down and
slept and it carried him all night. The next morning he saw something
dark far away, and when the boat brought him near he saw that it was a
summer cloud sitting on the bank of the river. The boat carried him to
the bank. He got out of it and it sank in the water until only the tail
could be seen. He found a trail under the cloud and followed it to the
top of a high hill and in the valley beyond he saw a large yellow tipi.
He put the gray bonnet on and went to the tipi and walked around it,
examining it closely. Then he went into it and found his wife making
moccasins and sat down near her.

He took off the gray bonnet. When his wife saw him, she was like one
dead with fear. When she revived she begged him to take her away from
that place, for the one who had stolen her and brought her there was a
malicious and terrible bird with three brothers who were as evil as it,
and that when they glared their glance would kill. The wizard told her
to have no fear for him, as he wished to see the bird that had stolen
her.

While they talked, there was a crash of thunder. The woman grew pale
with fear and said that the thunder was one of the birds coming. The
wizard told her to sit still as if she were making moccasins and if the
bird came in to go out and hurry to the bank of the river and wait for
him there.

In a short time, the bird came in and the wizard saw that it was the
Thunderbird from the north. Its voice was loud and rough as it said,
"Who has been here? There are tracks around the tipi." The woman said,
"No one has been here and gone. Look about the tipi for yourself." It
looked about the tipi but could see no one, so it said, "I will wait for
my brothers."

Soon there was another crash of thunder and another bird came in. The
wizard saw that it was the Thunderbird from the west. It said in a loud
coarse voice, "Who has been here? There are tracks about the tipi and in
the door?" The woman said, "No one has been here and gone. Look about
the tipi for yourself." It looked about the tipi but could see no one,
so it said, "We will wait for our brothers."

Then there was another crash of thunder and another bird came in. The
wizard saw it was the Thunderbird from the south. It said in a loud
coarse voice, "Who has been here? There are tracks around the tipi and
in the door and near the fireplace." The woman said: "No one has been
here and gone. Look about the tipi for yourself." It looked about the
tipi but could see no one, so it said, "We will wait for our brother."

Then there was a crash of thunder louder than the others, which shook
the tipi and the earth, and soon another bird came. It was larger and
more terrible than either of the others. The wizard saw that it was the
Thunderbird from the east. It said in a voice that sounded like the
growling of an angry bear, "Who has been here? There are tracks around
the tipi, and in the door, and near the fireplace and by the woman." The
woman said, "No one has been here and gone. Look about the tipi for
yourself." It looked about the tipi but could see no one and it said,
"Woman, the tracks are tracks of a human. The tracks axe of one of your
kind. You must be hiding him. You may be sitting on him. Get up and go
out of the tipi."

She went out of the tipi and hurried to the bank of the river as the
wizard had

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

told her. When she had gone, the Thunderbirds looked all about the tipi
but could see no one, so they gathered up the robes and bags and
everything that was in it, and threw them all out, but could find no
one. Then the Thunderbird from the north searched all the north side of
the tipi, and said, "There is no one in the north side of the tipi." The
Thunderbird from the west, searched the west side and said, "There is no
one in the west side of the tipi." The Thunderbird from the south
searched the south side and said, "There is no one in the south side of
the tipi." The Thunderbird from the east searched on one side of the
door in the east, and said, "There is no one on this side of the door."
As it crossed the doorway, the wizard struck it on the head and knocked
it down. It jumped up and knocked down the Thunderbird from the north
and it said, "Why did you do that?" and the Thunderbird from the east
said, "Why did you knock me down?" The Thunderbird from the north said,
"I did not knock you down."

Then the Thunderbird from the east knocked down the Thunderbird from the
west, and it said, "Why did you do that?" and the Thunderbird from the
east said, "Why did you knock me down?" and the Thunderbird from the
west said, "I did not knock you down." Then the Thunderbird from the
east knocked down the Thunderbird from the south, and it said, "Why did
you do that?" The Thunderbird from the east said, "Why did you knock me
down?" and the Thunderbird from the south said, "I did not knock you
down." Then the Thunderbird from the east said, "One of you has lied
tome, for one of you knocked me down." So they began to quarrel, and
soon were fighting. They fought until three of the birds were killed and
the other was weak and bloody.

The wizard saw that it was the Thunderbird from the west that was not
killed and he took off the gray bonnet and said to the bird, "You are an
evil thing. You delight in destroying and killing. You have even killed
your own brothers. Now I will kill you." The Thunderbird saw that he was
a wizard because he had appeared from nowhere. It was wounded and weak
from the loss of blood, so it cried like a woman and begged the wizard
to spare its life, but he said, "You have had no mercy on anything or
anyone, and I will have no mercy on you."

He threw the gray bonnet down and took the big knife in his hand and
stepped towards the bird to strike it, but the gray bonnet fell on the
body of one of the dead birds and he could not see it and he stumbled
over it and fell down. When he fell, the Thunderbird from the west
snatched the gray bonnet and put it on, and the wizard could not see it.
He searched long and carefully but could see neither the bird nor the
bonnet. Then the Thunderbird mocked him and said, "My brothers are now
dead. I am the Thunderbird. I shall keep the gray bonnet and no one
shall ever see me again. I am weak now and cannot harm you, but I shall
ever be your enemy. I will destroy and kill forever."

The wizard hurried to his wife on the bank of the river, but it was
night when he got there and the summer cloud sitting on the bank made it
very dark, so they waited for morning. During the night, they saw the
glare of the Thunderbird's eye, weak and faint like the northern light,
but towards morning it grew stronger and glanced towards them. As soon
as it was light enough for them to see, the wizard shook the tail of the
boat and it rose to the top of the water. They got into it quickly and
it carried them away very fast. It carried them all day. At night, they
slept in it and it carried them all night. The next morning, they saw
something far away. When the boat brought them near it they saw that it
was the wood on the bank of the river where the trail that led to his
grandmother's tipi started.

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

The grandmother stood on the bank waiting for them. When they got out of
the boat, she twisted its tail and it rolled over and over, up the bank
and into the wood. Each time it rolled over, it grew smaller and rounder
until it was a log again. They then went to the grandmother's tipi and
she said to him, "Grandson, I knew you would bring your woman back with
you. Now hang the gray bonnet and the big knife on the side of the tipi,
and if you are ever in trouble come to me."

Then the wizard told her how he had lost the gray bonnet. She went to
the top of a hill and wailed a song as if for the dead for she knew that
it was gone forever and no man would again wear it. She returned to the
tipi and said to the wizard, "My heart is heavy, for the gray bonnet is
gone forever. The Thunder is your enemy and it will wear it always.
Waziya and Iktomi are its friends and Heyoka and Iya will do its
bidding. It will plague you with these evil ones. There is but one
bonnet that will help you. That is the brown bonnet. It is far away, but
you must get it. When you are in trouble come to me."

She then gave the wizard and his wife food. When they had rested they
went on their way to their own tipi. When the people saw them they
rejoiced and the chief made a great feast for all. The wizard and his
wife lived happily until the winter moon had come when, one night his
wife woke him and said, "Waziya is blowing his breath on me." He knew
there would be trouble, so he went to his grandmother's tipi, and found
her waiting for him. She said, "Grandson, Waziya is troubling your wife.
You must get the brown bonnet. A stone wrapped the little brown bonnet
in a little red ball and swallowed it. You must find this stone and take
the brown bonnet from it. I will prepare you for this quest. Bring me
three things. A wolf, a turtle and a meadowlark." She then gave him food
and when he had rested, he went to find the wolf, turtle, and meadow
lark.

He traveled far on the plains, and met a huge wolf and said to him, "My
friend, come and eat with me." The wolf was hungry and sat beside the
wizard and they feasted all that day and far into the night. The next
morning the wizard told the wolf that he must go in quest of the brown
bonnet, and what his grandmother must have to prepare him for the quest.
The wolf said, "I have little hair. Waziya's breath pinches me. I will
help you that I may be revenged on Waziya."

So the wolf and the wizard traveled on together and they came to a great
muddy lake and met a huge turtle.

The wizard, whose name was Piya, said to the turtle, "My friend, come
eat with us." The turtle sat and ate with Piya and the wolf. In the
morning, Piya told the turtle as he had the wolf. The turtle said, "My
skin is thin and insects bite me, but I will help you so that I maybe
revenged on those who suck my blood." The wizard, the wolf, and the
turtle traveled far into the night.

In the morning, Piya spoke to the lark as he had the wolf and turtle.
The lark said, "My voice is harsh and I can sing but one note and the
magpie laughs at me; but I will help you so that I can make the magpie
ashamed." So Piya, the wolf, the turtle, and the lark went together to
the tipi of the wizard's grandmother.

She stood outside and said, "Grandson, I knew you would come and bring
that which I want." She then bade them go inside. She prepared a feast
for them and they feasted far into the night. In the morning Piya told
his grandmother what the wolf, the turtle, and the lark had said. She
told them that if they would give her what she wished she would give
each of them what he most wished. The wolf, the turtle, and the lark
agreed to this. She said she wished the wolf to give her grandson the
cunning by which he could follow a hidden trail and find hidden things;

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

the turtle to give him the sense by which he could locate water; and the
lark to give him the power to hide himself without a covering.

The wolf said he wished for fur clothing for himself and his people so
that they could laugh at the Old Man, Wazi. The turtle said he wished
for hard and tough clothing so that he could laugh at all insects that
bite and suck blood. The lark said he wished for a pleasing voice so
that he could sing and make the magpie ashamed.

The Old Woman then said that if they would first help her grandson as
she wished, she would give them and all their people what they wished.
She then told them how to go to a far region where there were neither
trees, nor grass, nor open trail, and but little water in hidden
springs. She gave Piya the big knife and a magic rattle and told him to
go upon the barren region and find his wife.

The wizard, the wolf, the turtle and the lark traveled together as the
Old Woman had instructed them. Piya was sad, for he thought of his wife,
but the others were happy, for they thought of that which the Old Woman
would give them. In the evening the wolf taught Piya how to lie hidden
with no covering. Thus they traveled many days and came to the barren
region. Piya took food and went alone upon this region, but he could see
no trail and wandered about until he remembered the cunning the wolf had
taught him. Then he found a hidden trail and traveled on it until
evening, when he located a spring hidden under a stone, with little
water in it. He camped there that night. In the morning a bear came and
Piya hid himself as the lark had taught him. The bear saw the stone was
taken from the spring, and he raged and sniffed about to find who had
drunk from his spring. Piya showed himself and the bear reared and
rushed to attack him. Piya shook the magic rattle toward the bear and he
could not move. Piya showed the big knife and the bear whimpered and
begged for pity and promised to help Piya in any manner. Then Piya told
of his wife and why he was there. The bear said that the Crazy Buffalo
had stolen his wife and kept her in his tipi which was four days'
journey distant; that the hidden trail was to this tipi which was like a
huge cactus; that no man could enter this cactus without wearing the
brown bonnet; and that the brown bonnet was hidden in a red stone that
was like a fruit on the cactus.

Piya traveled on the hidden trail for four days and then saw a huge
cactus. He bid himself and watched it. The Crazy Buffalo came from the
cactus. He hid himself and watched it. The Crazy Buffalo came from the
cactus and bellowed that he smelled a man. He sniffed this way and that
way and then rushed along the hidden trail, grunting and snorting.

When Piya could no longer see him he went to the cactus and saw what
appeared to be a large fruit on it. He struck the fruit with the big
knife. When it fell to the ground, he saw that it was a stone. He struck
the stone with the big knife and cut it through. The brown bonnet was
inside the stone and Piya put it on his head. A door opened in the
cactus and he went inside and when his wife saw him she was much afraid.

She said that the Crazy Buffalo was a ferocious demon and would kill
Piya when he came back. Piya, told her not to fear and do as he bade
her. When the Crazy Buffalo came and saw the broken red stone he
bellowed with rage. Piya hid. The demon came into the cactus and said,
"I smell a man. Where is he?" The woman said, "No man has been here and
gone." The Crazy Buffalo said, "You hid a man and I will gore you."
Piya. said to the woman, "Runaway from here." The Crazy Buffalo turned
to see who spoke and the woman ran from the cactus and far away. When
Piya showed himself and the Crazy Buffalo rushed to gore him, he shook
the

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

magic rattle. When the Crazy Buffalo heard the rattle he could not move.
He said to Piya, "You are a wizard and have much power. We should be
friends, for I also have much power. We can work together and we can do
anything that we may wish." Piya said nothing. The Crazy Buffalo said,
"If you will be my friend I will give you my power. You will be a chief
and a brave and the women will sing your songs." Piya said nothing. The
Crazy Buffalo said, "I will give you power so that you will have plenty
of meat and robes and can take the wives of other men and ravish the
young women and no one will harm you." Piya gazed far away, but said
nothing. The Crazy Buffalo grew bold and said, "Let me take the brown
bonnet and I will show you how to wear it so that you can do as you wish
in anything." Then Piya said, "You tell me lies to escape from me, but
you shall not escape." He drew the big knife and when the Crazy Buffalo
saw it he begged for mercy.

Piya said, "You are a demon who has had no pity for anyone, and I will
have no pity for you." He then struck the Crazy Buffalo with the big
knife and cut him into four pieces. Piya then went and found his wife.
Together they traveled on the hidden trail until they came to where the
wolf, the turtle, and the lark waited for them. All rejoiced and they
went to the Old Woman's tipi. She stood outside and said, "Grandson, I
knew that you would get the brown bonnet and find your wife."

She then made a feast and all feasted until far into the night. In the
morning she gave the wolf, the turtle, and the lark what each had wished
for, and together they went on the trail. She told her grandson to hang
the brown bonnet and big knife in the tipi, and keep the magic rattle,
and as long as it was in his tipi no harm would come to him or his wife.

The wizard and his Wife returned to her people and they rejoiced,
singing songs, dancing, and playing games. The chief made a great feast
and gave away all he possessed. The women put up a new tipi beside that
of the chief and the wizard's wife led him through its door and seated
him on the man's place.
