### THE HUNKA CEREMONY.

The *Hunka* ceremony is a Lakota ceremony in which two persons adopt the
*Hunka* relationship toward each other and thereby both assume a more
restricted relationship with all for whom the ceremony has been
performed. The term, *Hunka*, <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md)
expresses the relationship of each of the two persons to the other,
while the term, *Hunkaya*, expresses their relationship to all others
for whom the ceremony has been performed. The term, *Hunkayapi*,
designates the persons for whom the ceremony has been performed.

The relationship of *Hunka* is difficult to define, for it is neither of
the nature of a brotherhood, nor of kindred. It binds each to his
*Hunka* by ties of fidelity stronger than friendship, brotherhood, or
family. The relationship of *Hunkaya* is similar to that which the
members of a society bear toward each other, but the *Hunkayapi* have no
organization as a society and recognize no distinction among themselves
as *Hunkaya*. *Hunka* may be a relationship somewhat like that of parent
and child, when one is much older or more experienced than the other. In
such case, the older is *Hunka Ate* to the younger, while the younger is
simply *Hunka* to the older. If a *Hunka Ate* has the confidence of the
people, they, whether *Hunkayapi* or not, may title him *Mihunka*, which
indicates reverential respect.

The practice of assuming the *Hunka* relationship has existed among the
Lakota since ancient times. It is probable that at first there was
little ceremony other than an agreement between two persons; but that
when the practice became more common the Shamans assumed control, adding
rites until the ceremony assumed its present form. The most common
designation of the ceremony is, "They Waved Horse-tails over Each
Other." This appears to fix the time when the ceremony was given its
present form, for it alludes to a prominent rite of the ceremony.
According to the Oglala calendar a certain year is designated as "When
They Waved Horse-tails

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

over Each Other." The Lakota custom was to name each year according to
some event that was peculiar to, or first noticeable, during that year.
Therefore, it is probable that the year "When They Waved Horse-tails
over Each Other" was the year when the *Hunka* ceremony was first
performed with the rite of waving horse-tails over each other, or, at
least, the year when this rite was first noticeable. This year
corresponds to A.D. 1805. Perhaps at that time the horse was a rare
animal to the Lakota and as its tail was the most noticeable feature,
the Lakota considered it sacred, with the potency of sacred things, in
the same manner as they considered sacred the tail of a buffalo. The old
Lakota still so consider horse-tails and wave them over others to cause
an amicable influence. <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md)

Any two persons may become *Hunka*, provided a Shaman will perform the
ceremony. This proviso makes it difficult for a white man to become a
*Hunka*, for the Shamans are reluctant to perform the ceremony in such
cases. Any two Oglala may become *Hunka*, provided one who is entitled
to paint his hands red will perform the ceremony, but the ceremony is
most esteemed when it is performed by a Shaman. One who wishes to become
*Hunka* should first consult with the one with whom he desires to form
that relationship; or, if he wishes to become *Hunka* with a child, he
should consult with the parent, or the one who controls the child. If
the consultants do not agree the matter should be abandoned. If they
agree, they may proceed, and, in case one of them represents a child, he
should represent it during the ceremony, except in the rite of placing
the mark or badge of a *Hunka*, which should be placed on the person of
the child to become a *Hunka*. Having agreed to become *Hunka* they
should agree as to who shall perform the ceremony. He must be either a
Shaman, or one who is entitled to paint his hands red and should know
the rites and how and when to perform them.

He should be notified in sufficient time to enable him to prepare for
the ceremony, or if he should refuse, to choose another. When this is
done, then suitable provision for the ceremony should be made. When two
adults are to become *Hunka* it is expected that they will share alike
in making the provision, but if an older person desires to become
*Hunka* with a child, he should provide most for the occasion. The
requirements are sufficient food

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

for the feasts, articles for presents, and the material and implements
used in the rites. Those who are to provide should give as liberally as
is within their power, even to the extent of impoverishing themselves.
Their kindred and friends should aid them, for the degree of the
ceremony and the notability of the occasion is in proportion to the
feasts and presents expected.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1"></span>[122:1](sdo34.htm#fr_1.md) According to the late
Rev. W. J. Cleveland, the term *hunka*, while conforming to Dakota
phonetics appears to be a foreign word. This opinion of Rev. Cleveland
deserves serious consideration because of his perfect familiarity with
the language. The Oglala conception of the term is a kind of relation
like that of a brother, father, mother, sister, or child and parent. The
relationship is not exactly such as we consider fraternal, but was
looked upon by the Dakota as approximately the same as blood kin. In
fact, the *hunka* relationship often takes precedence over blood
relationship. Now, if it turns out that Rev. Cleveland's theory is
correct, then we may suspect that there is some relation between this
term and the Pawnee term, *hako*, which has been used by Miss Fletcher
as the name for a similar ceremony. As just stated, there are historical
reasons for believing that the Pawnee are chiefly responsible for the
introduction of this ceremony to the other tribes of the Plains--Editor.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[123:1](sdo34.htm#fr_2.md) This ceremony is
essentially the same as the Hako of the Pawnee of which we have a
published account. It also appears to be a form of the ceremony known to
early explorers as the "Waving the Calumet," though not necessarily
identical with it. If 1805 is really the date for its introduction to
the Oglala, then they can make no claims to its origination, except in
so far as they may have modified the ritual to bring it into harmony
with their own ceremonial concepts. Further, since an important part of
the *Hunka* wand stick is the horse's tail and since the ceremony is
sometimes spoken of as the ''waving of horses' tails over one," we must
infer that the ceremony took its present form since the introduction of
the horse.--Editor.
