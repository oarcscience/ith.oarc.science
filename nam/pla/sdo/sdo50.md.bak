### WAKAN TANKA.

(By Sword.)

When *Wakan Tanka* wishes one of mankind to do something he makes his
wishes known either in a vision or through a shaman.. . . The shaman
addresses *Wakan Tanka* as *Tobtob Kin*. This is part of the secret
language of the shamans.. . . . *Tobtob Kin* are four times four gods
while *Tob Kin* is only the four winds. The four winds is a god and is
the *akicita* or messenger of all the other gods. The four times four
are: *Wikan and Hanwikan*; *Taku Skanskan* and *Tatekan* and *Tob Kin*
and *Yumnikan*; *Makakan* and *Wohpe*; *Inyankan* and *Wakinyan*;
*Tatankakan*; *Hunonpakan*; *Wanagi*; *Waniya*; *Nagila;* and
*Wasicunpi*. These are the names of the good Gods as they are known to
the people.

Wakan Tanka is like sixteen different persons; but each person is *kan*.
Therefore, they are all only the same as one . . . . All the God persons
have ton. Ton is the power to do supernatural things . . . . Half of the
good Gods are *ton ton* (have physical properties) and half are *ton ton
sni* (have no physical properties). Half of those who are *ton ton* are
t*on ton yan* (visible), and half of those who are *ton ton sni* are
*ton ton yan sni* (Invisible). All the other Gods are visible or
invisible as they choose to be . . . . All the evil Gods are visible or
invisible as they choose to be . . . . The invisible Gods never appear
in a vision except to a Shaman . . . . Except for the Sun dance, the
ceremonies for the visible and the invisible Gods differ. The Sun dance
is a ceremony the same as if *Wikan* were both visible and invisible.
This is because *Wi* is the chief of the Gods. . . .
