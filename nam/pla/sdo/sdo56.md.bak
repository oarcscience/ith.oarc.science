### AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NOTE BY SWORD.

At the time of his death Sword was writing an autobiography from which
the following has been translated.

When I believed the Oglala *Wakan Tanka* was right I served him with all
my powers. I became a *Wicasa Wakan* (Shaman) and conducted all the
ceremonies of the Lakota, even the Sun dance, which is the greatest
ceremony of the Oglala. I danced the Sun dance to become a Shaman and
because of the scars on my chest no Oglala will deny my word. I was a
*pejuta wicasa* (medicineman) and belonged to the Matopi (Bears, a cult
or society of medicinemen) and the Bears have all the ceremonies of
other medicinemen and much more. I was a Blotaunka (leader of war
parties) and have fought according to Lakota customs against the enemy,
both Indians and white people, so I know all the customs of war that the
Oglala practised. I was *Wakiconze* (civil magistrate) and thus know all
the customs of the Oglala. I was eligible to chieftainship. In war with
the white people I found their *Wakan Tanka* the Superior, I then took
the name of Sword and have served *Wakan Tanka* according to the white
people's manner and with all my power. I became the chief of the United
States Indian Police and held the office until there was no trouble
between the Oglala and the white people. I joined the church and am a
deacon in it and shall be until I die. I have done all I was able to do
to persuade my people to live according to the teachings of the
Christian ministers.

I still have my *Wasicun* (ceremonial pouch or bundle of a Shaman) and I
am afraid to offend it, because the spirit of an Oglala may go to the
spirit land of the Lakota.
