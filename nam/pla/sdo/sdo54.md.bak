### SICUN.

(By Sword.)

The word *Sicun* is from the sacred language of the shamans. It
signifies the spirit of a man. This spirit is given to him at birth to
guard him against the evil spirits and at death it conducts him to the
land of the spirits, but does not go there itself. In the course of his
life a man may choose other *Sicun*. He may choose as many as he wishes
but such *Sicun* do not accompany him after death; if he has led an evil
life no *Sicun* will accompany him.

A shaman should direct a person in the choice of his *Sicun*. When the
Lakota chooses a *Sicun* such is the *Ton* of a *Wakan* or it may be the
*Ton* of anything When one chooses a *Sicun* he should give a feast and
have a shaman to conduct the ceremony, for no one can have the knowledge
necessary to conduct his own ceremony unless he has learned it in a
vision. One's *Sicun* may be in any object as in a weapon or even in
things to gamble with or in a medicine. But the *Sicun* that a man
receives at birth is never found in anything but his body. This *Sicun*
is like one's shadow.

No one ever had the *Ton* of the Sun for a *Sicun*, for the Sun will not
be a *Sicun* for anyone. On the other hand, the *Ton* of the Sky, while
a very powerful *Sicun*, may be secured through old and wise shamans.
The *Sicun* of the earth is the next most powerful and next in rank is
the *Sicun* of the rock. The *Sicuns* of the bear and the buffalo are
often chosen; but that of the bear more frequently. A Shaman's *Wakan*
bag is his *Sicun* and all *Sicun* are considered *Wakan*. A doctor's
medicine is his *Sicun* and the implements used by a shaman in any
ceremony are the *Sicun* of that shaman. Implements that are in such
*Sicun* will not be appropriate in a ceremony. A person may lend his
*Sicun* to another. The term *Wasicun* is applied to any object used as
a *Sicun* or it may represent anything which is *Wakan*. If a ceremony
by which one gets a *Wasicun* is performed in the most acceptable manner
that *Wasicun* will be the same in essence as the *Wakan* thing it
represents. An evil man cannot secure a good *Sicun*, but may secure an
evil one. If the ceremony be performed, a *Sicun* is secured. Then that
*Sicun* must do as it is directed to do by the one who chooses it; but
the chooser must know the songs that belong to it.
