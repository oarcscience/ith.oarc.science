### THE SYMBOLIC CAPTURE.

When the procession began, the younger man and his two friends entered
the preparation tipi, pulling down and tying the flap. When the
procession bad gone the fourth time around the circle, the Conductor
said, "My friends, we have gone around the world. *Yata* has closed the
door on *Wakinyan*. *Iktomi* has gone to the home of *Iya*. *Tatanka* is
in the lodge." This speech was a metaphor meaning that by the formal
march in every direction immunity from lightning was secured; *Iktomi*,
the imp of mischief and disturber of ceremonies, was driven away; and
the Buffalo, the patron God of Ceremonies, prevailed in the camp. The
Conductor then went to the preparation tipi and said, "The enemy is in
this tipi. Who will help me take him?" The older man who was to be made
*Hunka* said, "I will."

The Conductor asked him, "Are you *Hunka*?" He replied, "I am *Hunka*."
Then the Conductor cried in a loud voice, "*Hunka* must die for each
other." He then said, "We will capture the enemy." He rushed to the door
of the tipi, cut the strings that tied the flap, and he and the older
man went in hurriedly. In a few moments, they came out leading the
younger man by the arms, the Conductor singing the song of a returning
warrior. They led the younger man toward the ceremonial lodge, singing
as they went. The people followed them, some joining in the song. When
they came to the lodge the Conductor said, "We will kill the enemy but
if

anyone will take him for *Hunka* we will not kill him." The older man
said, "I will take him for my *Hunka*. Take him into the lodge." The
older man conducted the younger into the lodge and sat him between the
altar and the fireplace, facing the altar.

As many as the lodge would accommodate then entered it and seated
themselves in the following order: the Assistant at the right of the
*catku* and the Recorder at the left of it; men *Hunkayapi* on the right
side of the lodge and women *Hunkayapi* on the left; the drummer beside
the drum and the bearers of the rattles in front of him. At the right of
the Assistant, and in front of the women, were first, the bearer of the
ear of corn and next at his right the bearers of the wands. The people
who could not have seats inside sat in a circle before the door of the
lodge, the men together on the north side and the women on the south.
While the people were arranging themselves, the Conductor stood beside
the door and sang:--

"The meadow lark my cousin.  
A voice is in the air."

He repeated this song four times. Like all the ceremonial songs of the
shamans, this is figurative. It is explained as follows: To the Lakota,
the meadow lark is the symbol of fidelity, just as among
English-speaking people the dove is the symbol of peace. By claiming
relationship to the lark the Shaman claimed power to influence for
fidelity. By saying, "A voice is in the air," he implied that the
influence for fidelity pervaded the camp. Such vague and indefinite
expressions were common among the Lakota and though they are difficult
of interpretation, they were comprehended by them.
