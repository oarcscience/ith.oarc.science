### THE NUMBER FOUR.

(By Tyon.)

In former times the Lakota grouped all their activities by four's. This
was because they recognized four directions: the west, the north, the
east, and the south; four divisions of time: the day, the night, the
moon, and the year; four parts to everything that grows from the ground:
the roots, the stem, the leaves, and the fruit; four kinds of things
that breathe: those that crawl, those that fly, those that

walk on four legs, and those that walk on two legs; four things above
the world: the sun, the moon, the sky, and the stars; four kinds of
gods: the great, the associates of the great, the gods below them, and
the spirit kind; four periods of human life: babyhood, childhood,
adulthood, and old age; and finally, mankind had four fingers on each
hand, four toes on each foot, and the thumbs and the great toes of each
taken together are four. Since the Great Spirit caused everything to be
in four's, mankind should do everything possible in four's.
