### LEGENDS OF THE ORIGIN OF THE BUFFALO CEREMONY.

(Told by Antoin Herman, a mixed-blood Oglala.)

Iktomi, wandering in the west, came to the tipi of *Tatanka* who invited
him into his lodge and gave him an abundance of food. Then *Iktomi*
said, "My friend, you are large and strong, and very wise, while I am
small and weak, but I am also very wise. I am often very hungry and if
you will teach me the good things you eat to keep you so fat, I will
teach you many wonderful things." Then *Tatanka* said, "Buffalo grass is
very good. That is what I eat to keep me fat." *Iktomi* said, "Sage is
very good to eat and it Will make you fatter." Then *Tatanka* knew Chat
*Iktomi* was trying to play a trick on him, for he knew that sage is a
bitter medicine, so he said to himself, "I will think well on what
*Iktomi* says to me." *Iktomi* said, "My friend, let us prove that our
hearts are good towards each other. I will tell you what I fear more
than anything else and you tell me what you fear the most."

Tatanka said , "*How*." *Iktomi* said, "I am the oldest, therefore you
should tell first." *Tatanka* feared that *Iktomi* wished to play a
trick on him, so he said, "I fear more than anything else to be shot by
an arrow in the forehead, because the breath of my life is in my
forehead and my mysterious Power lies in my horns which grow from my
forehead." Then *Iktomi* said, "My mysterious power lies in my hair, and
I fear more than anything else to have my hair broken, for that would
kill me." Soon after this *Iktomi* saw a lone hunter and said to him,
"My friend, are you very hungry?" The hunter said, "I am very hungry."
*Iktomi* said, "If you will divide the fat meat with me I will tell you
how to kill *Tatanka*." The hunter said "*How*?" *Iktomi* said, "Hide
yourself on this trail and I will bring *Tatanka* near you when you must
shoot an arrow into his forehead and that will kill him." The hunter hid
himself on the trail and *Iktomi* went to *Tatanka* and said to him, "My
friend, I have found where there is a great plenty of buffalo grass.
Come with me and I will show it to you." *Tatanka* followed *Iktomi*,
watching him closely, and trying to learn what trick he was about to
play. Soon they came to Where the hunter was hidden, and he shot an
arrow into *Tatanka's* forehead. But. *Tatanka* had been performing his
ceremony in a wet wallow and the hair on his forehead was thickly matted
with mud which had dried hard, so the arrow did him no harm.

When he saw what the hunter had done he said to *Iktomi*, "This is the
trick that you have played on me. Because you have tried to have me
killed I will chew your hair and kill you." So he began to chew
*Iktomi's* hair. *Iktomi* screamed and acted as if he suffered much, and
after a little time he fell down as if he were dead. Then *Tatanka* said
to the hunter, "*Iktomi* played a trick on you; for he knew that if you
wounded me I would gore you to death. Let us be friends. I will do
something for you to show you that my heart is good toward you." The
hunter said, "*How*. *Iktomi* has fooled my people very often and I am
glad he is dead. To show you that my heart is good toward you I will do
something for you." *Tatanka* said, "You may do this. Shoot an arrow
where I ask you. What can I do for you?" The

hunter said, "Teach me the ceremony you perform in the wallow." *Iktomi*
jumped up and said, "I want to be friend to each of you." *Tatanka* said
to the hunter, "Shoot an arrow through his heart." *Tatanka* said to the
hunter, "Hereafter you may wear a circle of red paint over your heart as
a sign that you are a good hunter. Whenever a hunter kills an animal by
shooting it through the heart he will be entitled to wear such a circle
as a sign of honor. Go to your camp and seek a vision, and I will tell
you how to perform the ceremony.

The hunter returned to his camp and asked a wise Shaman to help him in
seeking a vision. So the Shaman went into the sweatlodge with him and
used powerful medicine and mysterious incantations and told him he must
purify himself by going into the sweatlodge four times. Then he must go
naked and alone to a high hill, taking with him only a robe, a pipe, and
willow bark to smoke. There he must invoke the Sun, *Maka*, *Inyan*, and
*Wakan Ska*. Then he must call the spirit of *Tatanka*, who would tell
him what to do. The hunter did as the Shaman had instructed him and when
he had invoked the four great mysteries he covered himself with the robe
and lay on the ground with his face covered.

He offered the smoke of the pipe to the spirit of *Tatanka* and then
called it to help him as it had promised. A great white buffalo came and
said to him, "What do you want more than any other thing?" He said, "I
am a young man and I want more than anything else, a good woman, one who
win be industrious, hospitable, and virtuous, and who will bear me
children." The buffalo said to him, "I will teach you my ceremony and
show you how to perform it. A girl is good. She has not yet formed her
habits. When she has her first menstrual flow she then becomes a woman.
At that time she is very mysterious and is susceptible to the influences
of the spirits. I will teach you how to drive the evil influences away
and how to invoke the good influences so that she may become a good
woman. When a girl has her first menstrual flow her family and her
friends should give a feast. They should choose a wise Shaman who will
teach her how to be hospitable, industrious, and virtuous. He will
invoke my spirit as you have invoked it. He must first burn sage to
drive away *Iktomi* and the spirit of the coyote and all evil
influences. He must burn sweetgrass to please the good spirits. The
first menstrual flow of a woman is powerful for good and evil, but she
must not destroy it. She must place it where it may be known what it is
and where animals cannot get at it. When she has so placed the blood
from her flow, then In y ceremony may be performed over her. The Shaman
will drive away the evil influences and invoke the good influences on
that day. He will sing mysterious songs and teach mysterious things. He
will sing this song first:--

A man coming from the west.  
A man coming from the west.  
Listen to him.

A man coming from the west.  
Speaking he says mysterious things.  
Listen to him.

All the girl's family and all her friends should listen to the Shaman
and the girl should remember what he says."

The hunter returned to his camp and told the Shaman what the white
buffalo had said. They called the people together and performed the
Buffalo ceremony as the white buffalo had taught the hunter to do.

The following is a liberal translation of another version of the same
legend.

Iktomi was very hungry. He schemed, to kill a bull buffalo, so as to get
plenty of fat meat. He said to the bull, "You are fat in the summer and
you are lean in the winter. I will show you what to eat so you will be
fat all the time. The bull knew that *Iktomi* would play a prank, so he
agreed, but said that *Iktomi* must eat first. *Iktomi* showed wild
hyacinth and ate of it. He began to swell. He said, "See how fat it
makes me." The buffalo said, "You are poisoned and wish to poison us."
Then he gored *Iktomi* through the stomach. He left him as dead, but he
only let the wind out of *Iktomi*'s stomach. He was well again. The bull
saw this. He said to a hunter, "My friend, if you will do something for
me I will do something for you." The hunter agreed. The buffalo said,
"Hide and I will bring *Iktomi*. When he is near you must shoot an arrow
through his heart." When they came near the hunter shot an arrow through
the heart of *Iktomi*. *Iktomi* said, "This is an evil thing you have
done; no one will believe me when they see the arrow in my heart." So
the hunter pitied him and drew the arrow out. The blood flowed and made
a red circle around the wound. *Iktomi* said that ever after when a
hunter shot a bull buffalo through the heart he shall wear a red circle
around his heart. The bull then said to the hunter, "What do you want?"
The hunter said, "I want a good woman who will bear many children." The
buffalo said, "I perform the ceremony in the wallow. I will show you how
to perform this ceremony to make all your women good." The buffalo
showed the hunter how to perform the Buffalo ceremony when a girl first
lives alone. This makes the influences good. If she does as they
influence she will be good. Good hunters will desire her. Brave warriors
will desire her. It was long ago when the buffalo bull showed how to
perform the buffalo ceremony.
