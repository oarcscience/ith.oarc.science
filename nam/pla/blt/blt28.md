### THE ELK

Old Man was very hungry. He had been a long time without food, and was
thinking how he could get something to eat, when he saw a band of elk on
a ridge. So he went up to them and said, "Oh, my brothers, I am lonesome
because I have no one to follow me."

"Go on, Old Man," said the elk, "we will follow you." Old Man led them
about a long time, and when it was dark, he came near a high-cut bank.
He ran around to one side where there was a slope, and he went down and
then stood right under the steep bluff, and called out, "Come on, that
is a nice jump, you will laugh."

So the elk jumped off, all but one cow, and were killed.

"Come on," said Old Man, "they have all jumped but you, it is nice."

"Take pity on me," replied the cow. "My child is about to be born, and I
am very heavy. I am afraid to jump."

"Go on, then," answered Old Man; "go and live; then there will be plenty
of elk again some day."

Now Old Man built a fire and cooked some ribs, and then he skinned all
the elk, cut up the meat to dry, and hung the tongues up on a pole.

Next day he went off, and did not come back until night, when he was
very hungry again. "I'll roast some ribs," he said, "and a tongue, and
I'll stuff a marrow gut and cook that. I guess that will be enough for
to-night." But when he got to the place, the meat was all gone. The
wolves had eaten it. "I was smart to hang up those tongues," he said,
"or I would not have had anything to eat." But the tongues were all
hollow. The mice had eaten the meat out, leaving only the skin. So Old
Man starved again.
