### THE FAST RUNNERS

Once, long ago, the antelope and the deer met on the prairie. At this
time both of them had galls and both dew claws. They began to talk
together, and each was telling the other what he could do. Each one told
how fast he could run, and before long they were disputing as to which
could run the faster. Neither would allow that the other could beat him,
so they agreed that they would have a race to decide which was the
swifter, and they bet their galls on the race. When they ran, the
antelope proved the faster runner, and beat the deer and took his gall.

Then the deer said: "Yes, you have beaten me on the prairie, but that is
not where I live. I only go out there sometimes to feed, or when I am
travelling around. We ought to have another race in the timber. That is
my home, and there I can run faster than you can."

The antelope felt very big because he had beaten the deer in the race,
and he thought wherever they might be, he could run faster than the
deer. So he agreed to race in the timber, and on this race they bet
their dew claws.

They ran through the thick timber, among the brush and over fallen logs,
and this time the antelope ran slowly, because he was not used to this
kind of travelling, and the deer easily beat him, and took his dew
claws.

Since then the deer has had no gall, and the antelope no dew claws.
