# BLACKFOOT LODGE TALES

<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span> <span id="page_vii">p. vii</span>

We were sitting about the fire in the lodge on Two Medicine. Double
Runner, Small Leggings, Mad Wolf, and the Little Blackfoot were smoking
and talking, and I was writing in my note-book. As I put aside the book,
and reached out my hand for the pipe, Double Runner bent over and picked
up a scrap of printed paper, which had fallen to the ground. He looked
at it for a moment without speaking, and then, holding it up and calling
me by name, said:—

"*Pi-nut-ú-ye is-tsím-okan,* this is education. Here is the difference
between you and me, between the Indians and the white people. You know
what this means. I do not. If I did know, I should be as smart as you.
If all my people knew, the white people would not always get the best of
us."

"*Nísah* (elder brother), your words are true. Therefore you ought to
see that your children go to school, so that they may get the white
man's knowledge. When they are men, they will have to trade with the
white people; and if they know nothing, they can never get rich. The
times have changed. It will never again be as it was when you and I were
young."

"You say well, *Pi-nut-ú-ye is-tsím-okan,* I have seen the days; and I
know it is so. The old things are passing away, and the children of my
children will be like white people. None of them will know how it used
to be in their father's days unless they read the things which we have
told you, and which you are all the time writing down in your books."

"They are all written down, *Nísah*, the story of the three tribes,
Sík-si-kau, Kaínah, and Pikŭ´ni."
