### SOCIAL ORGANIZATION

The social organization of the Blackfeet is very simple. The three
tribes acknowledged a blood relationship with each other, and, while
distinct, still considered themselves a nation. In this confederation,
it was understood that there should be no war against each other.
However, between 1860 and 1870, when the whiskey trade was in its
height, the three tribes were several times at swords' points on account
of drunken brawls. Once, about sixty or seventy years ago, the Bloods
and Piegans had a quarrel so serious that men were killed on both sides
and horses stolen; yet this was hardly a real war, for only a part of
each tribe was involved, and the trouble was not of long duration.

Each one of the Blackfoot tribes is subdivided into gentes, a gens being
a body of consanguineal kindred in the male line. It is noteworthy that
the Blackfeet, although Algonquins, have this system of subdivision, and
it may be that among them the gentes are of comparatively recent date.
No special duties are assigned to any one gens, nor has any gens, so far
as I know, any special "medicine" or "totem."

Below is a list of the gentes of each tribe.

It will be readily seen from the translations of the above that each
gens takes its name from some peculiarity or habit it is supposed to
possess. It will also be noticed that each tribe has a few gentes common
to one or both of the other tribes. This is caused by persons leaving
their own tribe to live with another one, but, instead of uniting with
some gens of the adopted tribe, they have preserved the name of their
ancestral gens for themselves and their descendants.

The Blackfoot terms of relationship will be found interesting. The
principal family names are as follows:—

As the members of a gens were all considered as relatives, however
remote, there was a law prohibiting a man from marrying within his gens.
Originally this law was strictly enforced, but like many of the ancient
customs it is no longer observed. Lately, within the last forty or fifty
years, it has become not uncommon for a man and his family, or even two
or three families, on account of some quarrel or some personal dislike
of the chief of their own gens, to leave it and join another band. Thus
the gentes often received outsiders, who were not related by blood to
the gens; and such people or their descendants could marry within the
gens. Ancestry became no longer necessary to membership.

As a rule, before a young man could marry, he was required to have made
some successful expeditions to war against the enemy, thereby proving
himself a brave man, and at the same time acquiring a number of horses
and other property, which would enable him to buy the woman of his
choice, and afterwards to support her.

Marriages usually took place at the instance of the parents, though
often those of the young man were prompted by him. Sometimes the father
of the girl, if he desired to have a particular man for a son-in-law,
would propose to the father of the latter for the young man as a husband
for his daughter.

The marriage in the old days was arranged after this wise: The chief of
one of the bands may have a marriageable daughter, and he may know of a
young man, the son of a chief of another band, who is a brave warrior,
of good character, sober-minded, steadfast, and trustworthy, who he
thinks will make a good husband for his daughter and a good son-in-law.
After he has made up his mind about this, he is very likely to call in a
few of his close relations, the principal men among them, and state to
them his conclusions, so as to get their opinions about it. If nothing
is said to change his mind, he sends to the father of the boy a
messenger

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

to state his own views, and ask how the father feels about the matter.

On receiving this word, the boy's father probably calls together his
close relations, discusses the matter with them, and, if the match is
satisfactory to him, sends back word to that effect. When this message
is received, the relations of the girl proceed to fit her out with the
very best that they can provide. If she is the daughter of well-to-do or
wealthy people, she already has many of the things that are needed, but
what she may lack is soon supplied. Her mother makes her a new cowskin
lodge, complete, with new lodge poles, lining, and back rests. A chiefs
daughter would already have plenty of good clothing, but if the girl
lacks anything, it is furnished. Her dress is made of antelope skin,
white as snow, and perhaps ornamented with two or three hundred elk
tushes. Her leggings are of deer skin, heavily beaded and nicely
fringed, and often adorned with bells and brass buttons. Her summer
blanket or sheet is an elk skin, well tanned, without the hair and with
the dew-claws left on. Her moccasins are of deer skin, with parfleche
soles and worked with porcupine quills. The marriage takes place as soon
as these things can be provided.

During the days which intervene between the proposal and the marriage,
the young woman each day selects the choicest parts of the meat brought
to the lodge,—the tongue, "boss ribs," some choice berry pemmican or
what not,—cooks these things in the best style, and, either alone, or in
company with a young sister, or a young friend, goes over to the lodge
where the young man lives, and places the food before him. He eats some
of it, little or much, and if he leaves anything, the girl offers it to
his mother, who may eat of it. Then the girl takes the dishes and
returns to her father's lodge. In this way she provides him with three
meals a day, morning, noon, and night, until the marriage takes place.
Every one in camp who sees the girl carrying the food in a covered dish

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

to the young man's lodge, knows that a marriage is to take place; and
the girl is watched by idle persons as she passes to and fro, so that
the task is quite a trying one for people as shy and bashful as Indians
are. When the time for the marriage has come,—in other words, when the
girl's parents are ready,—the girl, her mother assisting her, packs the
new lodge and her own things on the horses, and moves out into the
middle of the circle—about which all the lodges of the tribe are
arranged—and there the new lodge is unpacked and set up. In front of the
lodge are tied, let us say, fifteen horses, the girl's dowry given by
her father. Very likely, too, the father has sent over to the young man
his own war clothing and arms, a lance, a fine shield, a bow and arrows
in otter-skin case, his war bonnet, war shirt, and war leggings
ornamented with scalps,—his complete equipment. This is set up on a
tripod in front of the lodge. The gift of these things is an evidence of
the great respect felt by the girl's father for his son-in-law. As soon
as the young man has seen the preparations being made for setting up the
girl's lodge in the centre of the circle, he sends over to his
father-in-law's lodge just twice the number of horses that the girl
brought with her,—in this supposed case, thirty.

As soon as this lodge is set up, and the girl's mother has taken her
departure and gone back to her own lodge, the young man, who, until he
saw these preparations, had no knowledge of when the marriage was to
take place, leaves his father's lodge, and, going over to the newly
erected one, enters and takes his place at the back of it. Probably
during the day he will order his wife to take down the lodge, and either
move away from the camp, or at least move into the circle of lodges; for
he will not want to remain with his young wife in the most conspicuous
place in the camp. Often, on the same day, he will send for six or eight
of his friends, and, after feasting them, will announce his intention

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

of going to war, and will start off the same night. If he does so, and
is successful, returning with horses or scalps, or both, he at once, on
arrival at the camp, proceeds to his father-in-law's lodge and leaves
there everything he has brought back, returning to his own lodge on
foot, as poor as he left it.

We have supposed the proposal in this case to come from the father of
the girl, but if a boy desires a particular girl for his wife, the
proposal will come from his father; otherwise matters are managed in the
same way.

This ceremony of moving into the middle of the circle was only performed
in the case of important people. The custom was observed in what might
be called a fashionable wedding among the Blackfeet. Poorer, less
important people married more quietly. If the girl had reached
marriageable age without having been asked for as a wife, she might tell
her mother that she would like to marry a certain young man, that he was
a man she could love and respect. The mother communicates this to the
father of the girl, who invites the young man to the lodge to a feast,
and proposes the match. The young man returns no answer at the time,
but, going back to his father's lodge, tells him of the offer, and
expresses his feelings about it. If he is inclined to accept, the
relations are summoned, and the matter talked over. A favorable answer
being returned, a certain number of horses—what the young man or his
father, or both together, can spare—are sent over to the girl's father.
They send as many as they can, for the more they send, the more they are
thought of and looked up to. The girl, unless her parents are very poor,
has her outfit, a saddle horse and pack horse with saddle and pack
saddle, parfleches, etc. If the people are very poor, she may have only
a riding horse. Her relations get together, and do all in their power to
give her a good fitting out, and the father, if he can possibly do so,
is sure to pay them back what they have given.

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> If he cannot do
so, the things are still presented; for, in the case of a marriage, the
relations on both sides are anxious to do all that they can to give the
young people a good start in life. When all is ready, the girl goes to
the lodge where her husband lives, and goes in. If this lodge is too
crowded to receive the couple, the young man will make arrangements for
space in the lodge of a brother, cousin, or uncle, where there is more
room. These are all his close relations, and he is welcome in any of
their lodges, and has rights there.

Sometimes, if two young people are fond of each other, and there is no
prospect of their being married, they may take riding horses and a pack
horse, and elope at night, going to some other camp for a while. This
makes the girl's father angry, for he feels that he has been defrauded
of his payments. The young man knows that his father-in-law bears him a
grudge, and if he afterwards goes to war and is successful, returning
with six or seven horses, he will send them all to the camp where his
father-in-law lives, to be tied in front of his lodge. This at once
heals the breach, and the couple may return. Even if he has not been
successful in war and brought horses, which of course he does not always
accomplish, he from time to time sends the old man a present, the best
he can. Notwithstanding these efforts at conciliation, the parents feel
very bitterly against him. The girl has been stolen. The union is no
marriage at all. The old people are ashamed and disgraced for their
daughter. Until the father has been pacified by satisfactory payments,
there is no marriage. Moreover, unless the young man had made a payment,
or at least had endeavored to do so, he would be little thought of among
his fellows, and looked down on as a poor creature without any sense of
honor.

The Blackfeet take as many wives as they wish; but these ceremonies are
only carried out in the case of the first wife, the "sits-beside-him"
woman. In the case of subsequent

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

marriages, if the man had proved a good, kind husband to his first wife,
other men, who thought a good deal of their daughters, might propose to
give them to him, so that they would be well treated. The man sent over
the horses to the new father-in-law's lodge, and the girl returned to
his, bringing her things with her. Or if the man saw a girl he liked, he
would propose for her to her father.

Among the Blackfeet, there was apparently no form of courtship, such as
prevails among our southern Indians. Young men seldom spoke to young
girls who were not relations, and the girls were carefully guarded. They
never went out of the lodge after dark, and never went out during the
day, except with the mother or some other old woman. The girl,
therefore, had very little choice in the selection of a husband. If a
girl was told she must marry a certain man, she had to obey. She might
cry, but her father's will was law, and she might be beaten or even
killed by him, if she did not do as she was ordered. As a consequence of
this severity, suicide was quite common among the Blackfoot girls. A
girl ordered to marry a man whom she did not like would often watch her
chance, and go out in the brush and hang herself. The girl who could not
marry the man she wanted to was likely to do the same thing.

The man had absolute power over his wife. Her life was in his hands, and
if he had made a payment for her, he could do with her about as he
pleased. On the whole, however, women who behaved themselves were well
treated and received a good deal of consideration. Those who were
light-headed, or foolish, or obstinate and stubborn were sometimes badly
beaten. Those who were unfaithful to their husbands usually had their
noses or ears, or both, cut off for the first offence, and were killed
either by the husband or some relation, or by the *I-kun-uh´-kah-tsi*
for the second. Many of the doctors of the highest reputation in the
tribe were women.

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

It is a common belief among some of those who have investigated the
subject that the wife in Indian marriage was actually purchased, and
became the absolute property of her husband. Though I have a great
respect for some of the opinions which have been expressed on this
subject, I am obliged to take an entirely different view of the matter.
I have talked this subject over many times with young men and old men of
a number of tribes, and I cannot learn from them, or in any other way,
that in primitive times the woman was purchased from her father. The
husband did not have property rights in his wife. She was not a chattel
that he could trade away. He had all personal rights, could beat his
wife, or, for cause, kill her, but he could not sell her to another man.

All the younger sisters of a man's wife were regarded as his potential
wives. If he was not disposed to marry them, they could not be disposed
of to any other man without his consent.

Not infrequently, a man having a marriageable daughter formally gave her
to some young man who had proved himself brave in war, successful in
taking horses, and, above all, of a generous disposition. This was most
often done by men who had no sons to support them in their old age.

It is said that in the old days, before they had horses, young men did
not expect to marry until they had almost reached middle life,—from
thirty-five to forty years of age. This statement is made by Wolf Calf,
who is now very old, almost one hundred years, he believes, and can
remember back nearly or quite to the time when the Blackfeet obtained
their first horses. In those days, young women did not marry until they
were grown up, while of late years fathers not infrequently sell their
daughters as wives when they are only children.

The first woman a man marries is called his sits-beside-him wife. She is
invested with authority over all the other

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

wives, and does little except to direct the others in their work, and
look after the comfort of her husband. Her place in the lodge is on his
right-hand side, while the others have their places or seats near the
door-way. This wife is even allowed at informal gatherings to take a
whiff at the pipe, as it is passed around the circle, and to participate
in the conversation.

In the old days, it was a very poor man who did not have three wives.
Many had six, eight, and some more than a dozen. I have heard of one who
had sixteen. In those times, provided a man had a good-sized band of
horses, the more wives he had, the richer he was. He could always find
young men to hunt for him, if he furnished the mounts, and, of course,
the more wives he had, the more robes and furs they would tan for him.

If, for any cause, a man wished to divorce himself from a woman, he had
but to send her back to her parents and demand the price paid for her,
and the matter was accomplished. The woman was then free to marry again,
provided her parents were willing.

When a man dies, his wives become the potential wives of his oldest
brother. Unless, during his life, he has given them outright horses and
other property, at his death they are entitled to none of his
possessions. If he has sons, the property is divided among them, except
a few horses, which are given to his brothers. If he has no sons, all
the property goes to his brothers, and if there are no brothers, it goes
to the nearest male relatives on the father's side.

The Blackfeet cannot be said to have been slave-holders. It is true that
the Crees call the Blackfeet women "Little Slaves." But this, as
elsewhere suggested, may refer to the region whence they originally
came, though it is often explained that it is on account of the manner
in which the Blackfeet treat their women, killing them or mutilating
their features for adultery and other serious offences.

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

Although a woman, all her life, was subject to some one's orders, either
parent, relative, or husband, a man from his earliest childhood was free
and independent. His father would not punish him for any misconduct, his
mother dared not. At an early age he was taught to ride and shoot, and
horses were given to him. By the time he was twelve, he had probably
been on a war expedition or two. As a rule in later times, young men
married when they were seventeen or eighteen years of age; and often
they resided for several years with their fathers, until the family
became so large that there was not room for them all in the lodge.

There were always in the camp a number of boys, orphans, who became the
servants of wealthy men for a consideration; that is, they looked after
their patron's horses and hunted, and in return they were provided with
suitable food and clothing.

Among the Blackfeet, all men were free and equal, and office was not
hereditary. Formerly each gens was governed by a chief, who was entitled
to his office by virtue of his bravery and generosity. The head chief
was chosen by the chiefs of the gentes from their own number, and was
usually the one who could show the best record in war, as proved at the
Medicine Lodge, <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md) at which time he was
elected; and for the ensuing year he was invested with the supreme
power. But no matter how brave a man might have been, or how successful
in war, he could not hope to be the chief either of a gens or of the
tribe, unless he was kind-hearted, and willing to share his prosperity
with the poor. For this reason, a chief was never a wealthy man, for
what he acquired with one hand he gave away with the other. It was he
who decided when the people should move camp, and where they should go.
But in this, as in all other important affairs, he generally asked the
advice of the minor chiefs.

The *I-kun-uh´-kah-tsi* (All Comrades) were directly under

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

the authority of the head chief, and when any one was to be punished, or
anything else was to be done which came within their province as the
tribal police, it was he who issued the orders. The following were the
crimes which the Blackfeet considered sufficiently serious to merit
punishment, and the penalties which attached to them.

Murder: A life for a life, or a heavy payment by the murderer or his
relatives at the option of the murdered man's relatives. This payment
was often so heavy as absolutely to strip the murderer of all property.

Theft: Simply the restoration of the property.

Adultery: For the first offence the husband generally cut off the
offending wife's nose or ears; for the second offence she was killed by
the All Comrades. Often the woman, if her husband complained of her,
would be killed by her brothers or first cousins, and this was more
usual than death at the hands of the All Comrades. However, the husband
could have her put to death for the first offence, if he chose.

Treachery (that is, when a member of the tribe went over to the enemy or
gave them any aid whatever): Death at sight.

Cowardice: A man who would not fight was obliged to wear woman's dress,
and was not allowed to marry.

If a man left camp to hunt buffalo by himself, thereby driving away the
game, the All Comrades were sent after him, and not only brought him
back by main force, but often whipped him, tore his lodge to shreds,
broke his travois, and often took away his store of dried meat,
pemmican, and other food.

The tradition of the origin of the *I-kun-uh´-kah-tsi* has elsewhere
been given. This association of the All Comrades consisted of a dozen or
more secret societies, graded according to age, the whole constituting
an association which was in part benevolent and helpful, and in part
military, but whose main function was to punish offences against society

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

at large. All these societies were really law and order associations.
The Mŭt'-sĭks, or Braves, was the chief society, but the others helped
the Braves.

A number of the societies which made up the *I-kun-uh´-kah-tsi* have
been abandoned in recent years, but several of them still exist. Among
the Pi-kun'-i, the list—so far as I have it—is as follows, the societies
being named in order from those of boyhood to old age:—

There may be other societies of the All Comrades, but these are the only
ones that I know of at present. The Mūt'-sĭks, Braves, and the
Knats-o-mi'-ta, All Crazy Dogs, still exist, but many of the others are
being forgotten. Since the necessity for their existence has passed,
they are no longer kept up. They were a part of the old wild life, and
when the buffalo disappeared, and the Blackfeet came to live about an
agency, and to try to work for a subsistence, the societies soon lost
their importance.

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

The societies known as Little Birds, Mosquitoes, and Doves are not
really bands of the All Comrades, but are societies among the boys and
young men in imitation of the *I-kun-uh´-kah-tsi*, but of comparatively
recent origin. Men not more than fifty years old can remember when these
societies came into existence. Of all the societies of the
*I-kun-uh´-kah-tsi,* the Sin'-o-pah, or Kit-fox band, has the strongest
medicine. This corresponds to the Horns society among the Bloods. They
are the same band with different names. They have certain peculiar
secret and sacred ceremonies, not to be described here.

The society of the Stum´-īks, or Bulls, became obsolete more than fifty
years ago. Their dress was very fine,—bulls' heads and robes.

The members of the younger society purchased individually, from the next
older one, its rights and privileges, paying horses for them. For
example, each member of the Mosquitoes would purchase from some member
of the Braves his right of membership in the latter society. The man who
has sold his rights is then a member of no society, and if he wishes to
belong to one, must buy into the one next higher. Each of these
societies kept some old men as members, and these old men acted as
messengers, orators, and so on.

The change of membership from one society to another was made in the
spring, after the grass had started. Two, three, or more lodge coverings
were stretched over poles, making one very large lodge, and in this the
ceremonies accompanying the changes took place.

In later times, the Braves were the most important and best known of any
of the All Comrades societies. The members of this band were soldiers or
police. They were the constables of the camp, and it was their duty to
preserve order, and to punish offenders. Sometimes young men would
skylark in camp at night, making a great noise when

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

people wanted to sleep, and would play rough practical jokes, that were
not at all relished by those who suffered from them. One of the forms
which their high spirits took was to lead and push a young colt up to
the door of a lodge, after people were asleep, and then, lifting the
door, to shove the animal inside and close the door again. Of course the
colt, in its efforts to get out to its mother, would run round and round
the lodge, trampling over the sleepers and roughly awakening them,
knocking things down and creating the utmost confusion, while the mare
would be whinnying outside the lodge, and the people within, bewildered
and confused, did not know what the disturbance was all about.

The Braves would punish the young men who did such things,—if they could
catch them,—tearing up their blankets, taking away their property, and
sometimes whipping them severely. They were the peace officers of the
camp, like the *lari pūk'ūs* among the Pawnees.

Among the property of the Brave society were two stone-pointed arrows,
one "shield you don't sit down with," and one rattle. The man who
carried this rattle was known as Brave Dog, and if it passed from one
member of the society to another, the new owner became known as Brave
Dog. The man who received the shield could not sit down for the next
four days and four nights, but for all that time was obliged to run
about the camp, or over the prairie, whistling like a rabbit.

The societies known as Soldiers and Bulls had passed out of existence
before the time of men now of middle age. The pipe of the Soldier
society is still in existence, in the hands of Double Runner. The bull's
head war bonnet, which was the insignia of the Bulls society, was
formerly in the possession of Young Bear Chief, at present chief of the
Don't Laugh band of the Piegans. He gave it to White Calf, who presented
it to a recent agent.

In the old days, and, indeed, down to the time of the

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

disappearance of the buffalo, the camp was always arranged in the form
of a circle, the lodges standing at intervals around the circumference,
and in the wide inner space there was another circle of lodges occupied
by the chief of certain bands of the *I-kun-uh´-kah-tsi*. When all the
gentes of the tribe were present, each had its special position in the
circle, and always occupied it. The lodge of the chief of the gens stood
just within the circle, and about it his people camped. The order
indicated in the accompanying diagram represents the Piegan camp as it
used to stand thirty-five or forty years ago. A number of the gentes are
now extinct, and it is not altogether certain just what the position of
those should be; for while all the older men agree on the position to be
assigned to certain of the gentes, there are others about which there
are differences of opinion or much uncertainty. It is stated that the
gentes known as Seldom Lonesome, Dried Meat, and No Parfleche belong to
that section of the tribe known as North Piegans, which, at the time of
the first treaty, separated from the Pi-kun'-i, and elected to live
under British rule.

The lodges of the chiefs of the *I-kun-uh´-kah-tsi* which were within
the circle served as lounging and eating places for such members of the
bands as were on duty, and were council lodges or places for idling, as
the occasion demanded.

When the camp moved, the Blood gens moved first and was followed by the
White Breast gens, and so on around the circle to number 24. On camping,
the Bloods camped first, and the others after them in the order
indicated, number 24 camping last and closing up the circle.
