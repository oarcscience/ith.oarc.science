### THE BAD WIFE

#### I

There was once a man who had but one wife. He was not a chief, but a
very brave warrior. He was rich, too, so he could have had plenty of
wives if he wished; but he loved his wife very much, and did not want
any more. He was very good to this woman. She always wore the best
clothes that could be found. If any other woman had a fine buckskin
dress, or something very pretty, the man would buy it for her.

It was summer. The berries were ripe, and the woman kept saying to her
husband, "Let us go and pick some berries for winter." "No," replied the
man. "It is dangerous now. The enemy is travelling all around." But
still the woman kept teasing him to go. So one day he told her to get
ready. Some other women went, too. They all went on horseback, for the
berries were a long way from camp. When they got to the place, the man
told the women to keep near their horses all the time. He would go up on
a butte near by and watch. "Be careful," he said. "Keep by your horses,
and if you see me signal, throw away your berries, get on your horses
and ride towards camp as fast as you can."

They had not picked many berries before the man saw a war party coming.
He signalled the women, and got on his horse and rode towards them. It
happened that this man and his wife both had good horses, but the
others, all old women, rode slow old travois horses, and the enemy

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

soon overtook and killed them. Many kept on after the two on good
horses, and after a while the woman's horse began to get tired; so she
asked her husband to let her ride on his horse with him. The woman got
up behind him, and they went on again. The horse was a very powerful
one, and for a while went very fast; but two persons make a heavy load,
and soon the enemy began to gain on them. The man was now in a bad
plight; the enemy were overtaking him, and the woman holding him bound
his arms so that he could not use his bow.

"Get off," he said to her. "The enemy will not kill you. You are too
young and pretty. Some one of them will take you, and I will get a big
party of our people and rescue you."

"No, no," cried the woman; "let us die here together."

"Why die?" cried the man. "We are yet young, and may live a long time
together. If you don't get off, they will soon catch us and kill me, and
then they will take you anyhow. Get off, and in only a short time I will
get you back."

"No, no," again cried the woman; "I will die here with you."

"Crazy person!" cried the man, and with a quick jerk he threw the woman
off.

As he said, the enemy did not kill her. The first one who came up
counted *coup* and took her. The man, now that his horse was lightened,
easily ran away from the war party, and got safe to camp.

#### II

Then there was great mourning. The relatives of the old women who had
been killed, cut their hair and cried. The man, too, cut off his hair
and mourned. He knew that his wife was not killed, but he felt very
badly because he was separated from her. He painted himself black, and

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

walked all through the camp, crying. His wife had many relations, and
some of them went to the man and said: "We pity you very much. We mourn,
too, for our sister. But come. Take courage. We will go with you, and
try to get her back."

"It is good," replied the man. "I feel as if I should die, stopping
uselessly here. Let us start soon."

That evening they got ready, and at daylight started out on foot. There
were seven of them in all. The husband, five middle-aged men, the
woman's relations, and a young man, her own young brother. He was a very
pretty boy. His hair was longer than any other person's in camp.

They soon found the trail of the war party, and followed it for some
days. At last they came to the Big River, <span
id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md) and there, on the other side, they saw many
lodges. They crept down a coulée into the valley, and hid in a small
piece of timber just opposite the camp. Toward evening the man said:
"*Kyi*, my brothers. To-night I will swim across and look all through
the camp for my wife. If I do not find her, I will cache and look again
to-morrow evening. But if I do not return before daylight of the second
night, then you will know I am killed. Then you will do as you think
best. Maybe you will want to take revenge. Maybe you will go right back
home. That will be as your hearts feel."

As soon as it was dark, he swam across the river and went all about
through the camp, peeping in through the doorways of the lodges, but he
did not see his wife. Still, he knew she must be there. He had followed
the trail of the party to this place. They had not killed her on the
way. He kept looking in at the lodges until it was late, and the people
let the fires go out and went to bed. Then the man went down to where
the women got their water from the river. Everywhere along the stream
was a cut bank, but in one place a path of steps had been made down to
the water's

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

edge. Near this path, he dug a hole in the bank and crawled into it,
closing up the entrance, except one small hole, through which he could
look, and watch the people who came to the river.

As soon as it was daylight, the women began to come for water. *Tum,
tum, tum, tum*, he could hear their footsteps as they came down the
path, and he looked eagerly at every one. All day long the people came
and went,—the young and old; and the children played about near him. He
saw many strange people that day. It was now almost sunset, and he began
to think that he would not see his wife there. *Tum, tum, tum, tum*,
another woman came down the steps, and stopped at the water's edge. Her
dress was strange, but he thought he knew the form. She turned her head
and looked down the river, and he saw her face. It was his wife. He
pushed away the dirt, crawled out, went to her and kissed her. "*Kyi*,"
he said, "hurry, and let us swim across the river. Five of your
relations and your own young brother are waiting for us in that piece of
timber."

"Wait," replied his wife. "These people have given me a great many
pretty things. Let me go back. When it is night I will gather them up,
steal a horse, and cross over to you."

"No, no," cried the man. "Let the pretty things go; come, let us cross
at once."

"Pity me," said the woman. "Let me go and get my things. I will surely
come to-night. I speak the truth."

"How do you speak the truth?" <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) asked
her husband.

"That my relations there across the river may be safe and live long, I
speak the truth."

"Go then," said the man, "and get your things. I will cross the river
now." He went up on the bank and walked down the river, keeping his face
hidden. No one noticed him, or if they did, they thought he belonged to
the camp.

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> As soon as he had
passed the first bend, he swam across the river, and soon joined his
relations.

"I have seen my wife," he said to them. "She will come over as soon as
it is dark. I let her go back to get some things that were given her."

"You are crazy," said one of the men, "very crazy. She already loves
this new man she has, or she would not have wanted to go back."

"Stop that," said the husband; "do not talk bad of her. She will surely
come."

#### III

The woman went back to her lodge with the water, and, sitting down near
the fireplace, she began to act very strangely. She took up pieces of
charred wood, dirt, and ashes in her hands and ate them, and made queer
noises.

"What is it?" asked the man who had taken her for a wife. "What is the
matter with you?" He spoke in signs.

The woman also spoke in signs. She answered him: "The Sun told me that
there are seven persons across the river in that piece of timber. Five
of them are middle-aged, another is a young boy with very long hair,
another is a man who mourns. His hair is cut short."

The Snake did not know what to do, so he called in some chiefs and old
men to advise with him. They thought that the woman might be very strong
medicine. At all events, it would be a good thing to go and look. So the
news was shouted out, and in a short time all the warriors had mounted
their best horses, and started across the river. It was then almost
dark, so they surrounded the piece of timber, and waited for morning to
begin the search.

"*Kyi*," said one of the woman's relations to her husband. "Did I not
speak the truth? You see now what that woman has done for us."

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

At daylight the poor husband strung his bow, took a handful of arrows
from his quiver, and said: "This is my fault. I have brought you to
this. It is right that I should die first," and he started to go out of
the timber.

"Wait," said the eldest relative. "It shall not be so. I am the first to
go. I cannot stay back to see my brother die. You shall go out last." So
he jumped out of the brush, and began shooting his arrows, but was soon
killed.

"My brother is too far on the road alone," <span
id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) cried another relation, and he jumped out
and fought, too. What use, one against so many? The Snakes soon had his
scalp.

So they went out, one after another, and at last the husband was alone.
He rushed out very brave, and shot his arrows as fast as he could.
"Hold!" cried the Snake man to his people. "Do not kill him; catch him.
This is the one my wife said to bring back alive. See! his hair is cut
short." So, when the man had shot away all his arrows, they seized and
tied him, and, taking the scalps of the others, returned to camp.

They took the prisoner into the lodge where his wife was. His hands were
tied behind his back, and they tied his feet, too. He could not move.

As soon as the man saw his wife, he cried. He was not afraid. He did not
care now how soon he died. He cried because he was thinking of all the
trouble and death this woman had caused. "What have I done to you," he
asked his wife, "that you should treat me this way? Did I not always use
you well? I never struck you. I never made you work hard."

"What does he say?" asked the Snake man.

"He says," replied the woman, "that when you are done smoking, you must
knock the ashes and fire out of your pipe on his breast."

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

The Snake was not a bad-hearted man, but he thought now that this woman
had strong medicine, that she had Sun power; so he thought that
everything must be done as she said. When the man had finished smoking,
he emptied the pipe on the Piegan's breast, and the fire burned him
badly.

Then the poor man cried again, not from the pain, but to think what a
bad heart this woman had. Again he spoke to her. "You cannot be a
person," he said. "I think you are some fearful animal, changed to look
like a woman."

"What is he saying now?" asked the Snake.

"He wants some boiling water poured on his head," replied the woman.

"It shall be as he says," said the Snake; and he had his women heat some
water. When it was ready, one of them poured a little of it here and
there on the captive's head and shoulders. Wherever the hot water
touched, the hair came out and the skin peeled off. The pain was so bad
that the Piegan nearly fainted. When he revived, he said to his wife:
"Pity me. I have suffered enough. Let them kill me now. Let me hurry to
join those who are already travelling to the Sand Hills."

The woman turned to the Snake chief, and said, "The man says that he
wants you to give him to the Sun."

"It is good," said the Snake. "To-morrow we move camp. Before we leave
here, we will give him to the Sun."

There was an old woman in this camp who lived all alone, in a little
lodge of her own. She had some friends and relations, but she said she
liked to live by herself. She had heard that a Piegan had been captured,
and went to the lodge where he was. When she saw them pour the boiling
water on him, she cried and felt badly. This old woman had a very good
heart. She went home and lay down by her dog, and kept crying, she felt
so sorry for this poor man. Pretty soon she heard people shouting out
the orders of the chief. They said: "Listen! listen! To-morrow we move

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

camp. Get ready now and pack up everything. Before we go, the Piegan man
will be given to the Sun."

Then the old woman knew what to do. She tied a piece of buckskin around
her dog's mouth, so he could not bark, and then she took him way out in
the timber and tied him where he could not be seen. She also filled a
small sack with pemmican, dried meat, and berries, and put it near the
dog.

In the morning the people rose early. They smoothed a cotton-wood tree,
by taking off the bark, and painted it black. Then they stood the Piegan
up against it, and fastened him there with a great many ropes. When they
had tied him so he could not move, they painted his face black, and the
chief Snake made a prayer, and gave him to the Sun.

Every one was now busy getting ready to move camp. This old woman had
lost her dog, and kept calling out for him and looking all around.
"*Tsis'-i!*" she cried. "*Tsis'-i!* Come here. Knock the dog on the
head! <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md) Wait till I find him, and I'll
break his neck."

The people were now all packed up, and some had already started on the
trail. "Don't wait for me," the old woman said. "Go on, I'll look again
for my dog, and catch up with you."

When all were gone, the old woman went and untied her dog, and then,
going up to where the Piegan was tied, she cut the ropes, and he was
free. But already the man was very weak, and he fell down on the ground.
She rubbed his limbs, and pretty soon he felt better. The old woman was
so sorry for him that she cried again, and kissed him. Then the man
cried, too. He was so glad that some one pitied him. By and by he ate
some of the food the old woman had given him, and felt strong again. He
said to her in signs: "I am not done. I shall go back home now,

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

but I will come again. I will bring all the Piegans with me, and we will
have revenge."

"You say well," signed the old woman.

"Help me," again said the man. "If, on the road you are travelling, this
camp should separate, mark the trail my wife takes with a stick. You,
too, follow the party she goes with, and always put your lodge at the
far end of the village. When I return with my people, I will enter your
lodge, and tell you what to do."

"I take your speech," replied the old woman. "As you say, so it shall
be." Then she kissed him again, and started on after her people. The man
went to the river, swam across, and started for the North.

#### IV

Why are the people crying? Why is all this mourning? Ah! the poor man
has returned home, and told how those who went with him were killed. He
has told them the whole story. They are getting ready for war. Every one
able to fight is going with this man back to the Snakes. Only a few will
be left to guard the camp. The mother of that bad woman is going, too.
She has sharpened her axe, and told what she will do when she sees her
daughter. All are ready. The best horses have been caught up and
saddled, and the war party has started,—hundreds and hundreds of
warriors. They are strung out over the prairie as far as you can see.

When they got to the Missouri River, the poor man showed them where the
lodge in which they had tortured him had stood. He took them to see the
tree, where he had been bound. The black paint was still on it.

From here, they went slowly. Some young men were sent far ahead to
scout. The second day, they came back to the main body, and said they
had found a camping place

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

just deserted, and that there the trail forked. The poor man then went
ahead, and at the forks he found a willow twig stuck in the ground,
pointing to the left hand trail. When the others came up, he said to
them: "Take care of my horse now, and travel slowly. I will go ahead on
foot and find the camp. It must be close. I will go and see that old
woman, and find out how things are."

Some men did not want him to do this; they said that the old woman might
tell about him, and then they could not surprise the camp.

"No," replied the man. "It will not be so. That old woman is almost the
same as my mother. I know she will help us."

He went ahead carefully, and near sunset saw the camp. When it was dark,
he crept near it and entered the old woman's lodge. She had placed it
behind, and a little way off from, the others. When he went in the old
woman was asleep, but the fire was still burning a little. He touched
her, and she jumped up and started to scream; but he put his hand on her
mouth, and when she saw who it was she laughed and kissed him. "The
Piegans have come," he told her. "We are going to have revenge on this
camp to-night. Is my wife here?"

"Still here," replied the old woman. "She is chief now. They think her
medicine very strong."

"Tell your friends and relations," said the Piegan, "that you have had a
dream, and that they must move into the brush yonder. Have them stay
there with you, and they will not be hurt. I am going now to get my
people."

It was very late in the night. Most of the Snakes were in bed and
asleep. All at once the camp was surrounded with warriors, shouting the
war cry and shooting, stabbing, and knocking people on the head as fast
as they came out of the lodges.

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

That Piegan woman cried out: "Don't hurt me. I am a Piegan. Are any of
my people here?"

"Many of your relations are here," some one said. "They will protect
you."

Some young men seized and tied her, as her husband had said to do. They
had hard work to keep her mother from killing her. "*Hai yah*!" the old
woman cried. "There is my Snake woman daughter. Let me split her head
open."

The fight was soon over. The Piegans killed the people almost as fast as
they came out of their lodges. Some few escaped in the darkness. When
the fight was over, the young warriors gathered up a great pile of lodge
poles and brush, and set fire to it. Then the poor man tore the dress
off his bad wife, tied the scalp of her dead Snake man around her neck,
and told her to dance the scalp dance in the fire. She cried and hung
back, calling out for pity. The people only laughed and pushed her into
the fire. She would run through it, and then those on the other side
would push her back. So they kept her running through the fire, until
she fell down and died.

The old Snake woman had come out of the brush with her relations.
Because she had been so good, the Piegans gave her, and those with her,
one-half of all the horses and valuable things they had taken. "*Kyi!*"
said the Piegan chief. "That is all for you, because you helped this
poor man. To-morrow morning we start back North. If your heart is that
way, go too and live with us." So these Snakes joined the Piegans and
lived with them until they died, and their children married with the
Piegans, and at last they were no longer Snake people. <span
