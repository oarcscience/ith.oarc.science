### 8. The Old Woman and the Wild Beasts.

   An old woman was scraping a wolf-skin. A man came to her and asked
her, "What kind of skin are you scraping?" — "An ermine-skin." — "That
is not true." He ran away into the open. Then he came again and asked,
"What kind of skin are you scraping?" — "A fox-skin." — "Ah, that is not
true!"

   She named all kinds of skins. Then she grew angry, and shouted, "A
wolf-skin! I am scraping a wolf-skin! This is a wolf-skin!" — "Aha!" He
ran away, and did not come any more. He was a Wolf-Man. The next day all
kinds of wild beasts assembled, — wolves and bears, mice and foxes, and
wolverenes. From all sides they surrounded the old woman's house, and
were hostile. "Oh, did you come to see me?" said the old woman. "That is
right. <span id="page_430">p. 430</span> I am boiling berries to make a
pudding. Now come in! We will taste it. However, do take care lest
anybody come with a knife or a spear!"

   She deceived them, and put on the fire a kettle with water. Then she
covered the vent-hole. She threw rotten-wood on the fire, and the house
became full of smoke. They could not see anything. The Bear was rubbing
his eyes. "Oh, the smoke!" — "That's nothing," said the old woman, and
nudged him with her elbow. "Now let us taste of this pudding!"

   The smoke increased. The beasts wanted to go out, but could not find
the exit. The old woman stood watching by the exit, knife in hand. She
killed the beasts that were blinded by the smoke. She stabbed the wolf,
and cut the throat of the bear; she pierced the fox; she trampled on the
mouse. Then she took all the skins, which were of much value.

Told by Tal‘i´mak, an Asiatic Eskimo man, in the village of Uñi´sak, at
Indian Point, May, 1901.
