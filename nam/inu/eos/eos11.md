### 10. The Man who used Magic against the Storm.

   In the village of Uñi´sak lived a man and his brother. A heavy storm
arose, and the wind would not cease at all. It was impossible to hunt;
and half the inhabitants, those that were less strong and enduring, died
of starvation. Then the elder brother said to the younger one, "Go out
and try to restore quiet in the world." The youth went out, and called
into the darkness, "O great Outer World! your neighbor Sea-God is
killing us. From mid-ocean bring sea-food for our children!"

   He entered, and after a while sent his sister-in-law to look at the
weather. She entered, and said, "Oh, it is as before, wind and tempest."
He went out again. "O great Outer World! your neighbor Sea-God is
killing us. Bring from mid-ocean sea-food for our children!"

   He entered, and after a while sent his sister-in-law to look at the
weather. She returned, and said, "It is more quiet now." — "Aha!" He
went out again. "O great Outer World! bring from mid-ocean some sea-food
for our children!"

   At last it grew quiet, and the storm was over. Then far out at sea
there appeared a little cloud. A walrus's voice was heard roaring out of
the cloud. Then the snorting of a thong-seal and the cries of a young
ringed-seal were heard. Walrus, thong-seals, and ringed-seals came in
great numbers. They landed, and came directly to the houses. Some of the
houses were nearly crushed under their weight. All night the people were
stabbing them, until the morning. Then all the hunters were quite
exhausted. The sea-game went away, but all the storehouses were full of
meat of the best quality.

Told by Tal‘i´mak, an Asiatic Eskimo man, in the village of Uñi´sak, at
Indian Point, May, 1901.
