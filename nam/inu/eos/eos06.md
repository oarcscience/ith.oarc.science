### 5. Creation of the World. <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md)

   The Raven and his wife created the world. They made the cape of
Uñi´sak out of a nose of an eider-duck (*Somatheria spectabilis*); the
peninsula of Alaska, of a long belt-knife; and the island Ima´lik (one
of the Diomedes), of a button of the scabbard (with which it is clasped
around the hip). They made reindeer of their hair, and dogs of their
nails, and sea-water of their urine.

Told by Ñịpe´wġi, an Asiatic Eskimo man, in the village of Uñi´sak, at
Indian Point, May, 1901.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2"></span>[424:1](eos06.htm#fr_2.md) This fragment seems to
include material from two different sources, — one belonging to the
Raven cycle, and probably borrowed from the Chukchee; the other
referring to the creation of Uñi´sak and Alaska, undoubtedly Eskimo.
