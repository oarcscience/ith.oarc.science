### 31. THE DOG.

<span class="small">\[This tale is taken from a single
manuscript.\]</span>

AN old married couple had two sons and a little daughter. The sons were
renowned for strength, and for being able hunters. They used to return
with their seals towing in a long line behind them. But one day they did
not return. While the parents were still expecting them, a man brought
the sad news that he had seen them both hanging on an inaccessible rock.
They were hung up by the feet, head downwards, and nobody could get at
them to save them. This deed had been done by the inlanders. While the
old parents were in deep affliction for their loss, they heard that some
of their neighbours had a dog with a great many whelps. The mother sent
the daughter away to fetch one, which she adopted, and had it always on
the ledge beside her, nursing it with her own milk. In the winter, she
noticed that the dog (being endowed with magic power) sometimes went on
scratching his face, and at the same time always commencing to speak,
and asking, "What do I look like now?" Towards the end of the winter
they were in great want, having lost their protectors. The dog then said
he was going for a walk into the country. One night be roused his
foster-mother, <span id="page_228">p. 228</span> and having given
himself a scratching, inquired, "Am I still good-looking? I shall be off
to-morrow." The reason for thus scratching itself was *to frighten
people to death* (viz., by charm). He came upon the inlanders while they
were busy conjuring spirits. The angakok soon foretold his coming, and
cried, "Fire! fire!" but the dog scratched his face, and rushed into the
passage, hiding itself there. When the people came out, bringing lights
with them, the dog frightened them to death on the spot. Next he set off
in search of their storehouse, and carried some victuals back to his
foster-parents, and showed them the place where they could find the
rest. But from that time upwards the woman began to fear him; and in the
spring, when the boat was loaded and ready for starting, she asked the
dog to go back to the house and bring her something she had forgotten.
As soon as it had disappeared to obey her orders, they pushed off from
land, and set out on their journey. But the dog went on following along
the shore until they gained the last point, from which it could follow
them no longer. There it remained whining and howling. It is supposed
that this is the origin of the present custom with the dogs to follow
the departing boat along the coast, and go on howling at them from the
last point of land.
