143\. T<span class="small">HE</span> S<span class="small">WIMMER,
A</span> T<span class="small">ALE FROM</span> L<span
class="small">ABRADOR</span>.—A mother, who lived at a solitary place,
successively lost all her children, who were killed by enemies. Finally,
she got a son, whom from his babyhood she brought up with the aim of
making him fit for dwelling in the water like a seal. The enemies once
went to the place with the intention of killing him also. But the
mother, seeing the kayakers approach, told him to make his escape
through the water. The enemies, who observed him jumping into the water,
had no doubt they would get hold of him; but, swimming like a seal, he
seduced them far out to sea, when the mother whipped the surface of the
water with a string, causing a storm, by which they all perished, her
son being the only one saved.

<span class="small">N<span class="small">OTE</span>.—From East Greenland
there is a somewhat similar tale about a man having three sons, who
would not grow properly, and were brought up as swimmers.</span>
