119\. T<span class="small">HE</span> I<span
class="small">GDLOK</span>.—A man had lost his beloved cousin and
friend, who in his sight had been torn to pieces by one of those bears
that are made by sorcery. In his despair be went out to encounter and
brave all kinds of danger by way of excitement; and he first killed an
amarok. One evening, when staying at home, he was surprised in his
lonely house by a stranger dropping in, who explained that he also
having lost his brother was roaming about for excitement. Being very
talkative, he spent the evening there very pleasantly, until the
hostess, who had boiled some flesh of the amarok, came and served it
before the men. The guest then burst out in loud praises of its
delicious <span id="page_458">p. 458</span> flavour and tempting
appearance; but before he had taken a morsel he went on, "But I see the
dish is all aslope," and the same instant arose and vanished through the
entrance. The host immediately followed him; and on examining his
footsteps in the snow, he found them to be made by only one foot, so
that the guest must have been an *igdlokok* (whose body is only the one
half of the human body cut in twain).

<span class="small">N<span class="small">OTE</span>.—In another similar
story there are two guests, who at their sudden disappearance manifest
themselves as certain *stars* (**siagtut** or **ĸilugtûssat**). The
mysterious words about the sloping dish are the same.</span>
