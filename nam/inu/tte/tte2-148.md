they had grown larger, she ordered them to devour her father, whereupon
she divided them into two parties and sent them off from home to seek
their subsistence henceforth by themselves. Five of them, who were sent
up the country, grew erkileks; and to the other five she gave the sole
of an old boot, and put it in the sea, where it rapidly expanded and
grew a ship, in which they went off, turning into kavdlunaks
(Europeans).

<span id="page_471_note_1"></span>[1](#page_471_fr_1.md) This is an
abstract of the tale mentioned in the note to [No. 11](tte2-011.md) (p.
143), which for obvious reasons cannot be given in its original form. It
seems to exhibit an analogy to several traditions of other nations—the
idea about the origin of the Europeans, for instance, corresponding, as
far as we know, to the origin attributed by a Japanese popular tradition
to the Ainos of the Kurile Islands.
