131\. T<span class="small">HE</span> R<span class="small">EMOVAL
OF</span> D<span class="small">ISCO</span> I<span
class="small">SLAND</span>.—Off the southernmost part of Greenland an
island was situated which some of the inhabitants of the mainland took a
dislike to, because it cut them off from the open sea. Two old men got
the idea of removing it by help of some magic lay. Their names were
Nevingasilernak and Nivfigfarsuk; but another oldster, called
Kiviaritajak, rather inclined to retain the island. The first two went
in their kayaks to fasten a hair from the head of a little child to the
outside, while the last from shore tried to keep it back by means of a
thong of sealskin made fast to it. The two old kayakers then pushed off,
chanting their spells and tugging the hair. At length the thong burst,
and the island got afloat; and continually singing, they pulled away to
the north, and placed it in front of Ilulissat. It is now Disco Island.
The translation caused the bottom of the sea to rise all along where
they travelled.
