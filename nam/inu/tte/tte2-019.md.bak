### 19. AVARUNGUAK OR AGDLERUT.

AT a well-peopled place the trick of pinching was a favourite amusement
with the inhabitants. One night a girl, who was an only sister with a
number of brothers, came running in, crying, "I wonder who it can
possibly be who is always running after me and paying court to me?" They
told her that when he again made his appearance, she had better bring
him into the house. When at length she brought him in, it was a man
totally unknown to all of them. Avarunguak—such was his name—had grown
up in solitary places, and when he came among people he married this
girl, and after a while learned to manage a kayak, and grew an excellent
hunter. Once they had some visitors from the south, and an old woman of
the party accosted Avarunguak thus, saying, "If Avarunguak were to hear
of the nice hunt, and the many *auks*<span
id="page_177_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_177_note_1.md) we have down in the
south, I am sure he would be wanting to go there!" So saying, she went
away; but having heard her, Avarunguak could not sleep, so great was his
desire to go at once. Already the next morning he ordered his housemates
to make ready for the voyage; he wanted to be off for the south, he
said. They loaded the boat and got under way. On the way out they asked
the people they encountered whether the place was still far off, and all
made answer that it was not very nigh yet. At length they put on shore,
to rest from the toil of rowing, at a place where the people said that
to-morrow they might possibly gain their destination. "When ye leave
here, and have doubled the cape, ye will come in sight of a very large
tent—this ye must shun; but soon afterwards ye will perceive a little
<span id="page_178">p. 178</span> white point, and having also passed
this, ye will fall in with a great many people. To those ye shall go
up." On leaving, they soon observed the little white promontory right
enough. Avarunguak steered his boat towards the large tent, unheeding
the advice of his companions. On landing, a huge man came out from the
tent towards them, and receiving them very civilly, went on saying, "It
is really a matter of difficulty to get any one to keep company with
here; pray stay and live with me;" and accordingly they prepared for
wintering there.

Every morning Avarunguak awoke at an early hour, but somehow his
housemate was always out and off before him. One day in autumn he
happened to meet him on their look-out hill; and when the huge man
observed him, he said, "It will soon be the time when the auks will come
screaming across the country; then thou must be sure to get up in good
time." But rise as early as he might, Avarunguak was never able to be
beforehand with his companion, but always found he had gone out first.
One day, when he again overtook him on the hill, he said, "There, the
auks are coming across the sea. Make haste to thy tent; but mind, shut
the curtain closely, so that only one bird can get in at a time; and do
not begin to catch any of them until the tent is quite full." When
Avarunguak had entered and drawn the curtain close, he heard a tapping
and rustling, and the birds began to flutter in. He could not, however,
take time, but began catching them too soon, upon which the birds
instantly left; and at the same time he heard the man scolding, and
saying, "Didst thou not mind my telling thee that thou wert not to catch
them till the tent was quite full, lest I should be in want of food?"
Still, Avarunguak had got a great many birds, quite sufficient to live
upon for a good length of time. Some time after, his house-fellow said,
"Now it is near the time for the walrus, but I do <span id="page_179">p.
179</span> not pursue them; the red walrus is a very ferocious beast,
and at that time I do not venture out at all." When these animals
appeared, Avarunguak grew very excited about going, taking a great
interest in all kinds of hunting that were new to him. When he landed
his first walrus, his big companion came down to the beach, took hold of
the walrus, and dragging it along with only one hand, passed by
Avarunguak's tent, and carried it off to his own. Avarunguak wondered,
and said to himself, "I doubt if I shall have a taste of my first
walrus;" and entering, he saw the big man busy eating it all by himself,
his wife and daughter only looking on; but he did not dare to make any
objections. Next time he got a walrus the big man's wife came, and at
once carried off his prize, and, after her, their three daughters did
the same by turns. Not until they had all got their walrus did they
desist; and then, at last, he could think of providing for the ensuing
winter. In the beginning his huge friend proposed that they should come
and live all together in his house; and when Avarunguak consented, the
big man added, "We are five individuals ourselves, and consequently have
five windows. Now I suppose that thou wilt add as many as ye count
persons." To this Avarunguak answered, "Why, we have never built any
more than two or three windows for a company of travellers, with only
one boat, whatever their number may be."<span
id="page_179_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_179_note_1.md) "Then just do as thou
mayst like, and put in two or three windows, but only do come and live
with us." In the beginning of winter Avarunguak always caught plenty;
but the big man having no kayak of his own, never went out. As time wore
on, the sea froze up, and all hunting ceased. The master of the house
then spoke, "Here we are all badly off; but I know that behind our
country there is good hunting enough, and thither we intend to go
tomorrow." <span id="page_180">p. 180</span> Avarunguak had a great mind
to accompany them; but the other asked him, "How swift mayst thou be?"
"Why, I think I can run a race with any of the quadrupeds." But still
the man was very unwilling to take him with him, and only consented at
last after much beseeching. The next day they departed, all of them
carrying cords of sealskin round their necks. They crossed the
neighbouring mountains, and in the distance beheld a bare land, and then
the big man spoke: "Dost thou see yonder lofty mountains far away?
Behind, there is a sea where the *white whale* in abundance are found;
but when we get so far, thou must only aim at the small ones, because
thou wilt not be expert enough to carry home one of the larger ones." As
they wandered along, the daughters had to take hold of Avarunguak by his
arms to help him along, because he was not quite able to keep up with
them. When they reached the appointed place, each of them watched at a
cleft in the ice. No sooner did Avarunguak see a huge white whale rise
to the surface than he at once aimed at and killed it. Then the other
party came on, each of them bringing up two fish; but when the master
saw that Avarunguak had disobeyed his orders, he gave him a scolding;
and when they prepared to return, they wanted to tie his fish to their
own, and make him sit down on the top of it, and thus be dragged home.
But he answered, "Since I commenced hunting I have never let my game be
carried home by any one but myself, nor shall I do so now. I have caught
the fish myself, and will take care to bring it home." They let him have
his own way, but in a moment they disappeared from his sight, as if they
had been blown away. It was evening, and again beginning to dawn, before
he could even see his home, and he met the others coming back to fish
anew. It was not till the fourth day he got home; and on the way he had
been obliged to eat all the matak (skin) of his dolphin. Meanwhile his
<span id="page_181">p. 181</span> relatives had been very anxious about
him, thinking that perhaps his companion had killed him. About this
time, Avarunguak's people had a dog that happened to whelp. When the
first whelp appeared, the huge man whispered something to his wife, on
which she brought it him, and he took hold of it and examined all its
joints. The wife then put it back in its place, and subsequently brought
each new-born whelp to him to be examined in the same way; but when they
had handled the seventh, which was also the last, they were heard
saying, "This one is perfect; there is not a limb wanting." From that
time they seemed despondent; and Avarunguak, who began to fear their
intentions, one day said to them, "If you would like to have a dog, you
are welcome to take the one you like best." This seemed to please them
highly, and they chose the last born, and became so fond of it that they
let it stop on the ledge and sleep at night beside them. From this time
Avarunguak himself became a great favourite with his other
house-fellows. While the winter lasted, the big man once spoke as
follows, "We intend soon to go and visit our enemies." Avarunguak was
very desirous to join the party, but his house-master answered him, "No,
friend; thou wouldst too soon be worn out: for, in the first place, thou
canst not eat blubber and flesh enough; and secondly, because of thy
clumsiness and want of speed." He answered, "As to the blubber and
flesh, methinks I do well enough as regards both of them." Whereat the
big one rejoined, "Well, then, try to lick out the oil of all the lamps
here, beginning with the outermost." Avarunguak succeeded; and only a
few days after, the leader told him "that now he might accompany them to
their enemies," adding, "when we have entered, and begin licking the
oil, thou must be sure to help us. Next they will present each of us
with one large white fish, and thou must thrust thy knife right into it,
turn it round, and put the piece thou has cut out into thy <span
id="page_182">p. 182</span> mouth, and suddenly exclaim, 'I must go
outside, but I will be back in a moment, and go on eating; I enjoy it
very much.' But when outside take to thy heels, and run for home as fast
as possible, and before thou hast been off long, we shall empty the
lamps, and soon overtake thee." Some time after, they carried out their
intention of visiting their enemies in their place of abode. They at
once set about licking the oil of the lamps, beginning with the first,
Avarunguak joining them to the best of his ability. When the hosts saw a
stranger among their visitors, they regarded him keenly, so that the
huge man interposed: "That is a new housemate of ours; he is living with
us at present, and assists us every way,"—and they went on praising and
flattering him very much, and making a great deal of his dexterity and
strength, adding that he was more than a match for them every way. This
was anything but the truth; but they dared not do otherwise, for fear of
their enemies. The host now said, "Bring in the meal for the visitors,"
and the women instantly went out, and returned, bringing in large white
fish. The guests soon fell to; but Avarunguak forgot he had been advised
to leave off in good time, and never remembered till he was quite
satisfied. He then observed his companions making signs to him, and
quickly pronouncing the words he had been told, took himself off, and
commenced running as fast as possible. On coming near their own house he
turned round, and looking back, he saw that the creatures he had been
visiting were transformed into bears, pursuing him closely; but his own
housemates soon overtook him, and the daughters again took him by the
arms to speed him on. When they had almost reached the house, the
enemies seemed at their very heels, and Avarunguak was deserted by his
protectors, who gave him a blow, so that he fell, and the bears
instantly gathered round him. But he chanced to have a salmon for his
amulet, and this did him good <span id="page_183">p. 183</span> service
in making him too slippery to be caught hold of, and thus he escaped.
When spring came round, Avarunguak took a fancy to remove to another
place; and on departing, his huge companion said to him, "I hope thou
wilt soon return and stay with us; but wherever thou goest, mind to tell
the people never to kill a bear when one appears." Thus they departed;
but on turning round, they now saw that their housemates too had been
transformed into bears: they had been wintering among bears in human
shape. Later on they heard that some people in the south had killed a
bear, and still later Avarunguak and his wife died.
