88\. A<span class="small">TLUNGUAK</span> was a miserable hunter,
despised and mocked by his housemates, who only saw in him a poor wretch
always sitting behind his mother's lamp, and feeding upon what the
others brought home. But when some deed of special daring, which no one
else cared to undertake, was on hand, he at length bestirred himself,
and braved the danger alone. Thus, he first killed an ice-covered bear,
then an amarok, and finally a kilivfak (all fabulous animals).
