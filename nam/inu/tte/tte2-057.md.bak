### 57. THE WITCHCRAFT OF KULANGE.

IT was Kulange's (pron. Koolanghee's) business to bring up and down the
fishing implements, tools, and arms of the kayakers. Having no kayak of
his own, he only roamed about the country. He had but one friend; and on
a certain day he saw his friend engaged in opening a new grave and
cutting a piece out of the dead body. He had taken a morsel of flesh and
the bladder. He approached silently, and after having watched his
proceeding, he asked him what he was about. The friend turned round,
explaining to him, "I want it to work some witchcraft." But having thus
been taken by surprise, he got ashamed and wished to make it over to
Kulange, saying that he might use it advantageously any time he wanted
to injure some great hunter. He informed him that he ought to dry the
morsel of dead man's flesh, and put it beneath the point <span
id="page_329">p. 329</span> of the hunter's harpoon, and that in this
manner he might in less than a moment turn a clever hunter into a very
poor one. The bladder he was likewise to dry, and if ever he happened to
get an enemy, he was to blow it up, and, while the other was asleep,
press the air out upon him. At length Kulange accepted the gift, and
after making the grave up anew, they both departed. Meanwhile Kulange
put by the things, intending to try them on the first occasion. About
the beginning of winter one of his house-fellows had a particularly good
hunt, and consequently got quite rich. Kulange at once determined
whether he could put an end to his great good luck; with this view he
put a bit of the flesh beneath the point of his harpoon, while the owner
was sleeping, after which he sneaked silently away to his couch. On the
return of the kayakers the following evening, it happened that only he
on whose harpoon the bit of flesh had been concealed, was unsuccessful;
and this continued from day to day until one day Kulange again took it
away and cleaned the point well where it had been deposited. No sooner
had this been done, than the kayaker returned tugging a large seal after
him like all the rest, and he had the same good luck ever afterwards.
Kulange now thought that he had sufficiently tested the magic power of
the flesh, and he only awaited an opportunity to make somebody angry
with him in order to try the effect of the bladder. It so happened that
his daughter-in-law got offended with him, and in her wrath called him
"the nasty Kulange." The next day it blew a gale from the south, and he
went out to fill the bladder with air. When she was asleep in the
evening, he went up beside her and let the air out upon her. At dawn she
awoke with a swelling in her side, and later in the day she was swollen
all over. Her husband instantly rowed away to fetch an angakok from a
neighbouring place. He came back with him, and after having practised
his incantations <span id="page_330">p. 330</span> for some time in the
darkened room, he knew enough to tell that the misdeed had been done by
Kulange, who immediately confessed his guilt, saying, "I certainly did
it, and here are the implements given me by my friend." Having heard the
whole state of the case, the bewitching objects were sunk deep in the
sea; but the wicked friend was put to death.
