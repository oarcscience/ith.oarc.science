### 64. NAUJARSUAK AND KUKAJAK.

<span class="small">\[A tale from South Greenland.\]</span>

NAUJARSUAK and Kukajak were friends, and both skilled hunters. They
lived apart; but being very fond of each other, they were often
together. In spring, when the first seals had made their appearance,
they used to bring full-loaded boats with dried meat to their
storehouses. Once Kukajak happened to have put by a greater store than
his friend, and this made Naujarsuak jealous. Kukajak used to go away
deer-hunting in the spring, and did the same that summer; and on his way
home in the autumn, he was as usual to <span id="page_355">p. 355</span>
pass by his store-places on the coast, and take out some dried seal-meat
for a welcome feast at home. He was longing greatly for some dried
seal-flesh himself. But on arriving at his stores, he found that the
foxes had been there beforehand, and had left nothing for him. On a
close examination, he found out that some one had been making little
holes in the stone coverings, just large enough for a fox to pass
through. He got extremely vexed; and at home he learned that Naujarsuak
had made the holes during his absence. At this intelligence he became
still more angry; but nevertheless he could not help longing for his
friend; and he started on a visit to him the day after. Naujarsuak, in
his turn, was longing as much to see Kukajak; and as soon as the other
had arrived, he hastened to draw his kayak on land, and take him to his
house. During the meal, Kukajak carelessly observed, "I also had a small
portion of dried meat put by, but the foxes have carried it all off,
which has never happened to me before." Naujarsuak remarked, "Thou hast
been wrong in coming so late to look after thy stores." At this speech
Kukajak got inwardly enraged. Having passed the night beneath his
friend's roof, he, as usual, invited him to accompany him home to have
some dried reindeer-flesh. While they were thus talking, they saw from
land some kayakers stopping outside, lying in wait for seals, when, all
of a sudden, Kukajak came upon his friend from behind, and sent his
harpoon right through him. The little son of Naujarsuak was standing on
the beach, and saw his father being killed, while Kukajak called out, "I
paid him back, because he spoiled my stores," and then turned his back
upon them, and rowed home. The old father of Naujarsuak now took away
the corpse of his son, and had it buried; and when the usual days of
mourning had gone by, he accosted the little one thus—"Now thou hast
seen thy father killed, it will not do for thee to grow up in idleness."
He then resolved <span id="page_356">p. 356</span> to leave his place,
where he was continually reminded of his lost son. They travelled on to
Amerdlok (the present Holsteinsborg), where they established themselves
for the winter. Here the boy grew up under the constant care and
unceasing admonitions of his grandfather; and he was never seen to
smile. While they were still at Amerdlok, he grew to manhood, assisted
at the whale-fishing, and turned out an able and expert kayaker. Under
these circumstances, the old man advised him to go southwards and
revenge himself on Kukajak, if he were still alive; and during this last
winter he carefully secured the whalebones whenever a whale was caught,
knowing them to be a rare article, much in request in the south. When
the first thaw set in, they started; and at every place they passed by,
they inquired, "Have ye heard nothing of Kukajak?" but invariably the
answer was, "No; we don't know him." Far away south, however, they met
some people who told them—"Kukajak! ah, yes; he is all right! but
getting rather old now, and has taken to frog-fish." At length they
reached their former home, and settled there for good. All their
relatives immediately came to see them after their long absence; and on
leaving they presented them with some of the longest and best
whalebones. They had many unexpected visitors, some of whom only came in
the hope of getting their share of whalebones, which were well known to
be desired for gifts. As time wore on, they had to change their tent for
a winter hut; but as yet Naujarsuak's son had had no opportunity of
avenging the murder of his father. He one day requested his grandfather
to make him a very big harpoon, with a strong line to match. The
grandfather got it ready for him the very next day; and, regarding it
with great satisfaction, the son smiled, and thanked him, and concealed
it carefully beneath the ledge. Some time after, Kukajak took a great
fancy to go and ask the son of <span id="page_357">p. 357</span> his
betrayed friend for a piece of whalebone for his fishing-line, but on
further consideration gave up the idea, fearing that he might bring down
vengeance upon himself if he carried it out. However, the people
thereabout were always telling him of the gifts they had received,
saying, "If thou goest, thou wilt be sure to get some too: it was only
the other day the old man said that he longed much to see thee." On
hearing this, he could resist no longer, and started the very next day.
He got a friendly welcome, and was beginning to think "they had
forgotten all about the murder." A plentiful repast was soon served up
before him; and the talk went merrily round all the evening; but
somehow, whenever there was a short silence, he always thought, "there,
now, it all returns to them." At daybreak the following morning, when
Naujarsuak's son went outside the house, the thought struck him it was
just on such a day that his father was killed. The air was soft, and
light clouds appeared and passed by overhead. At this his former wrath
awoke with full force; but on entering the house, he looked quite
guileless. At Kukajak's departure, he also was presented with
whalebones. Still he apprehended some evil, and kept glancing back to be
sure that he was not pursued; and thus he succeeded in getting a
considerable way off. Now, however, was the time for Naujarsuak's son to
make use of his new weapon. He took the bone-point which his grandfather
had made, brought it down, and fixed it with a loud jerk. Kukajak heard
the sound, and recognised the meaning (viz., charm) of it; and seeing
his enemy in full pursuit, he hastened on as quickly as he could, but
found his strength fast failing. Perceiving this, his enemy pursued him
more slowly; and Kukajak began thinking that he might reach home
unharmed. At that moment, however, his adversary again darted on, and,
just outside his own house, took aim, and sent his lance with a great
crash into Kukajak's body. The son of <span id="page_358">p. 358</span>
Naujarsuak now turned to the bystanders, saying, "I saw him treat my
father in the same way; and I have only paid him back; if ye care for
his corpse, ye may take it." Having finished this speech, he left for
home; and from that day his father was not always in his thought, though
he never quite forgot him.
