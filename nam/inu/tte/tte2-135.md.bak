135\. T<span class="small">HE</span> S<span
class="small">UNRISE</span>.—A man from the east coast of Greenland from
love for his home never left it even during the summer-time; and among
his principal enjoyments was that of gazing at the sun rising out of the
ocean. But when his son grew up he became desirous of seeing other
countries, and, above all, accompanying his countrymen to the west
coast. At length he persuaded his father to go with him. No sooner,
however, had he passed Cape Farewell, and saw the sun about to rise
behind the land, than he insisted upon returning immediately. Having
again reached their home island, he went out from his tent early next
morning, and when his people had in vain waited for his return, they
went out and found him dead. His delight at again seeing the sunrise had
overpowered and killed him.
