130\. T<span class="small">HE</span> H<span class="small">ELP
FROM</span> I<span class="small">NGNERSUIT</span>.—An old man once met
with an ingnersuak, who invited him to his house, and told him that he
had watched in order to have some talk with him that no one else might
hear. He wanted to let him know that, if ever he was in want, he only
had to apply to him for help—the ingnersuak would at any time provide
him with food. The old man from this time had a comfortable life, being
always supplied with what he required. But at last he began to hint at
the source of his riches to other people, and henceforth the ingnersuak
declined to assist him further.
