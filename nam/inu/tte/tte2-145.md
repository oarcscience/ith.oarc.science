145\. T<span class="small">HE</span> S<span class="small">HARK AS</span>
P<span class="small">ROVIDER</span>.—A mother with her daughter being
abandoned by their relatives, and helpless, were saved from starvation
by a dead seal which drifted to the shore. After a time they found
another, and a shark appeared to them, rising out of the sea, and saying
that now he would supply all their wants. He took up his abode with
them; and afterwards, when some inuarutligaks were approaching, he took
the two women on his back, along with all their implements, and brought
them away to an island.
