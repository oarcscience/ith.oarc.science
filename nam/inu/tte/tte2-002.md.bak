### 2. THE BLIND MAN WHO RECOVERED HIS SIGHT.

<span class="small">\[The text of this story has been collated from
eight copies, among which two have been received from Labrador, the rest
from different parts of Greenland, three of them having been written
down before 1828. Like the former, it seems to have no historical, but
only a moral or mythological reference.\]</span>

A WIDOW had a son and a daughter. When the son grew up, he made himself
useful in different ways, and also commenced seal-hunting. One day in
the beginning of winter he caught a *thong-seal* (a very large species,
*Phoca barbata*<span id="page_99_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_99_note_1).md). On
bringing it home, his mother wanted the skin for a ledge-cover, but he
insisted on having it for making *hunting-lines*.<span
id="page_99_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_99_note_2.md) The mother grew angry, and
in preparing the skin and removing the hairs, she practised some
witchcraft on it, and spoke thus: "When he cuts thee into thongs, when
he cuts thee asunder, then thou shalt snap and smite his face;" and she
rejoiced in the thought that it would hit him. When she had finished her
preparations, <span id="page_100">p. 100</span> and he had cut out the
first thong, he stretched and strained it; but in scraping it with a
shell, a small blister burst, and hitting both his eyes, blinded him.

The winter coming on, they were destitute of their main provisions, and
had to live entirely upon mussels (*Mytilus edulis*); and the blind boy
took his place on the ledge, unable to go out hunting any more. Thus he
passed the first half of the winter. A great bear then appeared, which
began to eat away their (skin<span
id="page_100_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_100_note_1).md) window-pane, and next
thrust its head into the room. The mother and the sister fled in great
terror to the inmost retired part of the ledge; but the blind man said
to his sister, "Please bring my bow;" and she having given it to him, he
bent it, and asked her to take the right aim for him. Levelling it at
the animal, she gave him the signal, whereon he shot, and the arrow
struck the bear so that it fell to the ground. The mother said, "Thou
hitst the window instead of the beast;" but his sister whispered, "Thou
hast killed a bear." They had now provisions for the coming days; but
the mother never gave her son any of the boiled bear-flesh, but only a
few shell-fish instead, and never let him taste a meal from his own
hunting, but, in order to starve him, concealed her having any flesh.
His sister, however, gave him his portion when the mother was absent,
and he swallowed it in haste before her return. In this manner the
greater part of the winter passed away. At last the days lengthened; and
one day, in the spring, the sister said, "Dost thou remember how very
delightful the time was when thou hadst still got thy sight, and wast
able to go out hunting, and how we used to roam about the country?" The
brother answered, "To be sure; let us be off again. I can take hold of
thee." And the next morning at daybreak they went out together, he
taking <span id="page_101">p. 101</span> hold of her garments; and all
day long they wandered about, the sister occupied in gathering
shrubs<span id="page_101_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_101_note_1.md) for fuel.
One day they came to a large plain beside a lake, and the brother then
said, "I think I will lie down a little, while thou goest away to find
more fuel;" and accordingly she left him. Whilst he was thus resting
himself, he heard some wild geese flying in the air above him, and when
they were right over his head, he heard one of them crying out, "Look at
the poor young man down there; he is blind: would we could make him
see." When the birds approached him he never stirred, but lay quietly on
his back. At this moment he had a sense of something warm falling down
on his eyes, one of the wild geese having dropped its excrement upon
them, and heard a voice saying, "Keep thy eyes shut till the sound of
our wings has altogether passed away, then thou mayst try to open them."
Again he lay down motionless; while the wild goose, sweeping its wings
across his face, repeated, "Mind thou dost not open thy eyes." The sound
of their wings now dying away, he already observed a certain brightness;
but when the noise had altogether passed away, he opened his eyes wide,
and had his sight restored to him. He now called out, "*Nayagta!*" (so
he called his sister). But she did not return till evening, when she was
seen coming across the country, moody and downhearted, with one arm
drawn out of the sleeve of her jacket, and her chin hidden in the fur
collar. Perceiving her, he again called out, "Nayagta, now thou needst
not be in want of food or anything else; I shall give thee clothes, for
now I have my sight again." But she only gainsaid him, and would not
believe him until she looked into his reopened eyes, and saw their sound
and healthy appearance. They both agreed not to let their mother know
what had happened. In descending the hills, and approaching <span
id="page_102">p. 102</span> the house, he caught sight of his bear-skin
stretched out to dry, and in front of the entrance its bones, and on
entering the main room he got a glimpse of its paws. Shutting his eyes,
he now took his usual place on the ledge, and feigning to have been
asleep, he started up, saying, "I dreamt I saw a bear-skin stretched out
behind the house;" but the old woman merely replied, "Thou must surely
have been thinking about somebody who happened to hurt thee some time
ago." Again the son feigned sleeping, and starting up, he said,
"Methinks I also saw a lot of bear-bones outside the entrance." The old
woman repeated her first answer; but the third time, on seeming to
awake, the son said, "I dreamt I saw two bear's paws here underneath the
couch;" and the mother again giving the same answer, suddenly opening
his eyes, he said, "Mother, I mean these;" and then she knew that he had
regained the use of his eyes, and she exclaimed, "Eat them, just eat
them!" He now took up his old habits, and again commenced seal-hunting;
but, after some time, the idea grew upon him to take revenge on his
detestable old mother. The season was at hand when the *white
whales*<span id="page_102_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_102_note_1.md) began to
appear along the ice-bound shore, and he used to catch them in the
following manner: he went out on the ice with his sister, and having
fastened his hunting-line round her waist, he threw the harpoon which
was attached to the line into the fish, thus making her serve him
instead of a hunting-bladder.<span
id="page_102_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_102_note_2.md) After which, they hauled
together till they had safely landed the fish on the ice, where they
afterwards killed it.

One day, returning home, he asked his sister, "Dost thou like our old
mother?" She made no answer; but on his repeating the question she only
answered, "I am <span id="page_103">p. 103</span> more fond of thee than
of her; thou art the only one I do love." "Well, then, to-morrow she
shall serve us for a bladder. I'll pay her off for having made me
blind." They both agreed upon the plan; and returning to the house where
they found the mother busy mending boots, he said, "Oh dear, how tired
we are with hauling in the fish! Now let my sister have a rest
to-morrow; meantime thou mightst serve me as a hunting-bladder. I
suppose thou canst keep thy footing when the fish pull the line." The
mother declaring herself willing, they all went down to the open sea the
next morning; but when the white whales appeared, and he was preparing
to harpoon them, she said: "Take one of the smallest, and not the large
ones;" and perceiving some very little fish coming up, she cried, "Look
out and try for one of these;" but be answered, "They are still too
big." At the same instant, however, one of the very largest fishes rose
to the surface; and harpooning it, he let go his hold of the line, and
when the animal had drawn his mother pretty close to the water, he cried
out, "Dost thou remember the time thou madest me blind?" and while she
endeavoured to hold back, he pushed her on, saying, "That fellow will
give me my revenge." When she was close to the very edge of the water,
she cried, "My *ullo!*" (woman's knife)—"it was I who nursed thee;" and
with these words she was plunged into the sea, which soon covered her.
Still she reappeared on the surface, crying, "My *ullo*, my *ullo;* I
nursed thee!" but then disappeared for ever. It is said that she was
afterwards transformed into a fish, and that her spreading hair turned
into long horny teeth, from which the narwals<span
id="page_103_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_103_note_1.md) are said to have their
origin. The white whales having all disappeared, brother and sister
returned to the house, and lamented the loss of their mother, feeling
conscious that she had nursed them, and taken care of them. <span
id="page_104">p. 104</span> They now began to be terrified at their
deed, and dared not stay in their little house; they therefore fled on
eastward, far away to the large continent, roaming about the interior
parts of the country.<span
id="page_104_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_104_note_1.md) At first he would not
even kill a bird, feeling pity towards them for having restored the use
of his eyes to him; but at last he killed a swan, because his sister
wanted to have it, and it is said that this was the only bird he caught
for the remainder of his life. Far away from the coast they built their
house; they grew to be immensely old, and were always without friends.
At length they determined to show themselves among other people, and he
resolved upon going to some place which had an *angakok* (priest of the
heathens). After a while he found such people, and decided to await the
time when the angakok was going to conjure his spirits. He then went up
to the house; but ere he reached it, the angakok began to complain, and
cried, "I am going to let a spirit out upon you; a large fire is just
outside" (viz., the *kivigtok*, supernatural beings in general making
their appearance like a flame or brightness). The man who was standing
outside now made his inquiry: "Do you not know me?—have ye heard of him
who used his mother for a hunting-bladder?" and as no one answered him,
he repeated the same question over again. An old woman now rejoined: "I
remember to have heard in my childhood that many many years ago there
lived a brother and a sister who fastened their poor mother as a bladder
to a white whale." The stranger outside then said: "I am that very man;
I have come to denounce myself: do come out and see what I am like." The
angakok went out, followed by his auditors, and they saw him standing
erect in the bright moonlight beside the boat. The hair of his head was
snowy white, as if he <span id="page_105">p. 105</span> had been covered
with a hood of white hare-skins; but his face was black, and his clothes
were made of reindeer-skins, and he told them that his sister was not
able to move from old age, and that they had their hut far away in the
interior of the country, and that their house-fellows

![](105.jpg)

were terrible beings with heads like seals; and lastly he added: "After
this, I will not show myself any more to human creatures; those to whom
I wanted to denounce myself I have done it to." After having said these
words he turned away, and has never been seen afterwards.

<span class="small"> N<span class="small">OTE</span>.—The son's name has
in Greenland been called Tutigak; in Labrador, Kemongak. According to
the Labrador tale, the birds make him dive into the lake; according to
the Greenland readings, the mother cried, "*It was I who cleared away
thy urine*"—instead of "*nursed thee*."</span>
