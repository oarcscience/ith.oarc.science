### 37. THE BROTHER WHO WENT TO AKILINEK IN SEARCH OF HIS SISTER.

<span class="small">\[In regard to this story, which is very widely
known in Greenland, we refer to the introductory sections, where it is
pointed out as one of those most probably resting upon a historical
basis, representing the invention of dog-sledging, or the teaming and
training of some wild animal, from which the present Eskimo dog has
descended. Akilinek is now by the Greenlanders considered a fabulous
country beyond the sea; but it may be supposed to have been a real
country opposite to the original homesteads of their ancestors.\]</span>

AN old man had a son and two daughters. His son being a first-rate
hunter and provider, the father at length gave up kayaking himself. His
son could overtake and outrun every animal on shore; and at sea he was
an excellent hand at harpooning. His eldest sister used to follow him
along the shore, where she amused herself by catching partridges in
little traps, and generally got a good many. At a time when the sea was
frozen over, they one day went away to the outermost islets. There the
brother saw a fox and set off to pursue it. After a short absence among
the islets, he returned with the fox; but meanwhile the sister was gone.
He looked for her everywhere, and called out, but she did not come. At
length he detected the trace of a sledge, but as it was growing dark, he
had to go home without his sister. On his return, he grew silent and
reserved, but after a while said to his father, "Oh how much I should
like to have a sledge!" The father rather favoured this idea, and at
once set about making him one. The next morning the son set out on foot,
but returned at nightfall without having killed anything, and went to
sleep without saying a word. In the morning he asked his father to
provide him with <span id="page_249">p. 249</span> some cords, saying
that he wanted to fetch home an animal to pull his sledge for him; and
then he went off and stayed away. Towards evening a strange noise was
heard, and the little sister went outside to see what it was, but
instantly returned in great alarm, exclaiming, "Oh, what dreadful
monster is this my dear brother has brought home with him?" When he
entered, the father asked him, "What beast is it thou hast got?" "Why,
it is only a little bear I have caught to drag my sledge; I hope thou
wilt make a harness for it; I want him to be trained shortly." The
father complied, and the son left off hunting for a while in order to
train the bear; but when he had finished this, he took him along with
him on his excursions. Another time he again returned late in the
evening quite exhausted, and turned in without speaking a word. The
following morning he asked his father for more cords; but this time they
must be still stronger. Having received what he wanted, he went away. In
the evening a strange noise was again heard, on which the little sister
went outside, but returned quite horrified, saying that it was still
more frightful than the last time. When he had entered, and the father
questioned him, he answered, "Oh, it's nothing but a little *amarok*
(wolf or fabulous animal) I have caught to match the bear." These two,
however, could not agree; and he had often to use his whip to part them
when they were going to fight. After training, however, they pulled very
well together; but now he wanted a third one, and having set out for it
in the morning, he did not return till late at night, when his parents
had long been quite miserable on account of his long absence; and he
went to sleep as before without speaking to any one. The next morning he
applied to his father for strings and lashings, but this time none but
the very strongest would serve him; having got them, he went off as
usual. In the evening there was a terrible noise outside, for now he had
got the bear, <span id="page_250">p. 250</span> the amarok, and an
*agshik* (a fabulous monster) fighting each other. At length he had them
all tamed and trained; and he once more turned to his father, saying,
"All I wish for is a sledge." His father was quite willing, and made him
one of very hard wood, with many knots in it. When the sea was frozen
over, he went out to try his team, following the coast southwards, and
returned towards evening on the same day. When his father questioned him
as to how far he had been, he answered: "'If thou wert to leave with a
boat early in spring, thou wouldst not have reached the place I got at
to-day before autumn. In going home we made great speed, but the bear
got tired, and I was obliged to take him into the sledge beside me; but
the agshik is incapable of tiring, and will be of great use to me." The
next day he travelled on in the same manner to the north, returning home
at night; and having made some similar remarks, he added, "The agshik, I
find, is soon provoked, and goes off in a fury; he will be rather
dangerous for strangers to encounter." The ice now covering the sea all
over, and not having broken up, although it had been very stormy, he
supposed he might trust himself out on it; and the weather again became
settled and beautiful. He then spoke to his parents thus: "Don't ye
remember the day I wandered out on the ice with my sister and lost her
there? Since that day I have sought her far and near all over our
country: where can she have gone to? Not even the bones of her corpse
did I find; but on the day I lost her, in looking for her, I noticed the
marks of a sledge on the ice, leading right to sea. Any other trace of
her I have never seen; and therefore I should now like to go across to
Akilinek, as I shall certainly not be at rest until I have found her."
The parents tried to persuade him to stay, saying, "It does not matter
for thy sister, who has been lost to us for such a great length of time;
don't go away in search of her as far away as that, but <span
id="page_251">p. 251</span> bear in mind thou art now our only provider.
Out yonder is a cleft in the ice so wide that thou mayst never cross
it." The son then rejoined, "To be sure my animals cannot swim; the bear
only in some degree is capable of that: but if I don't succeed, I shall,
of course, return." The parents repeated their warnings, but he got all
the more bent upon going, come what might, so that he should only find
his sister. When he arrived at the exact spot where he had formerly seen
the trace of a sledge, he turned right seawards, and after a while lost
sight of the land. The bear now got tired as before, and being only a
hindrance, he took it on the sledge. Driving continually straight on, he
again came in sight of land, and observed the tracks of many sledges;
and on approaching the shore, he saw them in all directions. He now
looked all around him to find out which way he had better turn. In the
meantime he had made fast his animals to an iceberg near the strand, and
went to shore himself to see if any people were to be found there. He
had not walked long before he saw a number of houses, which made him
stop and consider; but after a while he advanced, and having found an
entrance, he walked up to a large house and went inside. Having entered
and given the inmates a look, he at once recognised his sister sitting
down with a baby on her lap. When he had seated himself on the side
bench, she also recognised him, and they began to speak to each other,
and she said, "On the same day thou left me to pursue thy fox, a man in
a sledge happened to pass by; and in no time I was taken up and carried
away to this place, and that is the reason why thou seest me here. I am
married, but at present my husband is out as usual. However, I expect
him home very soon, and when he comes thou must look at him well." The
brother now rejoined, "Since that day I have done nothing but try to
find thee out; all over the country I have travelled in search of thee;
how lucky it is that I <span id="page_252">p. 252</span> find thee at
last!" Whilst they sat waiting, some one called out, "There he is
coming!" and looking out at the window the brother-in-law saw his
sister's husband driving on towards the house with a number of young
reindeer pulling his sledge. Though he sped on at a good rate, the other
thought his own animals still swifter, and considering himself to be
quite a match for the new-comer, he again seated himself without any
further remark. When the husband entered, he kept his eyes constantly
fixed on the visitor sitting beside his wife; and without a word to any
one, leaned back on the ledge after having taken his place upon it, so
that nothing but his heels resting on the edge of it were visible. The
relatives being thus interrupted, left off speaking for a time; however,
she told her brother that it was for fear of her husband, who used to
speak very little, she added, being of a shy disposition. On hearing
this he came a little closer to them, and they began to converse
together. The guest spoke of his happiness in seeing his sister so well
off, and said, that seeing she had such a good provider, he would not
trouble himself any more about her in future; and further, he proposed
that they should come and visit him and his parents on the opposite
shore. But his brother-in-law did not fancy this much: he gave as a
pretext that the cold would be too severe for the children. Both now
wanted to persuade him to stay, but he said he must needs go and look
after his animals, without mention of what kind they were. His relatives
gave him some of the children's clothes for a gift to the parents: he
put them on his shoulders, went to his sledge, and departed. When he had
got so far that he had lost sight of the land, the bear again got tired,
and was taken in beside him. On his return, his parents rejoiced greatly
at seeing the clothes of their daughter's little children, and on
hearing that their long-missed daughter was coming to visit them. One
day during fine weather, when they were <span id="page_253">p.
253</span> <span id="p253"></span>{see [picture](p253.md) on page 253}
<span id="page_254">p. 254</span> anxiously expecting them, sledges were
seen coming across the ice, which made them all very happy, and the
little sister, who was of a merry temper, was hardly able to contain her
joy. When her sister's sledge had come still closer, she gave a jump and
bounded over the boat, which was put up on the boat-pillars. But all of
a sudden the sledgers were seen to put about—probably they took fright
at seeing her brother's animals and at the girl indulging in such wild
pranks. They now called out loudly for them, and the parents were very
much distressed and wept together. This sight made the son take pity on
the old people, and to punish the fugitives he let loose the agshik,
being the most furious of the lot, to pursue them. In a moment the
sledgers as well as the agshik disappeared; but on his return the agshik
was all bloody around the muzzle. In all likelihood he devoured them
all. The brother did not go in search of them, as he did not expect any
of them to be alive.

<span class="small">N<span class="small">OTE</span>.—The tale here given
is nearly literally translated from one manuscript; besides which three
copies have been received, and one verbal narration has been written
down by the author himself. The latter, comprising the most frequent
variations of the tale, substitutes a cousin in the place of the
brother. When he had turned mute and sorrowful on account of his having
lost a dear companion, his father spoke to him saying, "At the
neighbouring hamlet to the north of us, there are several old people,
and old people generally are rich in stories; go to them for the purpose
of cheering thy mind." One morning the son at length took a fancy to go
and visit these old folks; and on his arrival there, one old man told
him how in the days of his youth, when he had been roaming about in
quest of sport and excitement, he had once on the brink of a rock
happened to discover a *kukissook* (fabulous animal with great fangs)
with its young ones. While he was gazing at these awful beasts, a little
sparrow happened to pass by, flying over their heads. At the same moment
the old animal, which had till then been couchant, bounded into the air,
snatching the body of the sparrow so that the wings fell to the ground
separately, at the sight of which the man had been struck with terror,
and fled the spot for ever. The visitor on hearing this asked exact
information about the locality of the place, and having returned to his
father, made ready for an excursion, uponwhich he captured a kukissook.
The remaining part of the story agrees with the version given. But when
the cousin with her husband and child comes to visit their relatives,
instead of being frightened <span id="page_255">p. 255</span> and
turning back, they decided to stay with them; but the brother-in-law
from Akilinek did not dare to step outside the house for fear of the
sledge animals, and being too tall for the ledge, he was obliged to lie
on the floor. At length he grew tired and ventured outside, whereupon
the cousin of his wife set the kukissook upon him, causing him to be
torn to pieces. He then also went on to kill the child, saying it was of
no real human descent, and might grow like its father. The two cousins
then adopted their former mode of life, roaming about their home
together, where their bones are now resting. The illustration
accompanying the text refers to one of the written variations of the
story.</span>
