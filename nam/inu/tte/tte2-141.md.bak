141\. A T<span class="small">ALE FROM</span> E<span
class="small">AST</span> G<span class="small">REENLAND</span>.—Two
cousins loved each other, but one of them having a passion for outdoing
other people, grew irritated at seeing the other not only getting first
married, but also having the first son, and that one catching seals
before his own son had got a bird. He then removed to another place, and
his son trained a dog to tear men to pieces, by feeding it with food
that had been in contact with human bones. It had already devoured
several travellers when the cousin and his son came and attacked the
dangerous animal, and killed it between them.
