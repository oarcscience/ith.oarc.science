### 13. THE BARREN WIFE.

<span class="small">\[This very popular tale has been collated from
three copies agreeing in all essential particulars.\]</span>

A MAN had a wife who begat him no children. The husband, who was envious
of all the people who had children, one day told her to make herself
trim and nice, and walk on to a certain spot where an old man, who had
given up seal-hunting, had his fishing-place. This old man, however, was
a great magician. The next day, while he sat fishing in his kayak, a
little way off the shore, she appeared on the beach dressed in her best.
But as the old man, afraid of her husband, would not approach her, she
soon returned. The husband himself now went to the old man, and promised
him half of his <span id="page_149">p. 149</span> "catch" if he could
think of some means whereby to get children. When the wife appeared on
the beach the next day, the old man instantly made for the shore, and
went up to her. From this day forwards the husband always put by half of
the seals he caught for the old man: and when he noticed that his wife
was *enceinte*, he asked the old man to take up his abode in their
house; upon which he rejoined, "Thy wife will bear thee a son. To-morrow
when thou goest out kayaking thou must row to the birds-cliff and get
hold of a bird,<span id="page_149_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_149_note_1.md)
which he shall use for an amulet." On the following day, when the
husband had brought the bird, the old man went on, "Farther, thou must
fetch a hollow stone, of a black colour, on which the sun has never
shone;" and when he had also brought this, the old man said, "Finally,
thou must go to thy grandmother's grave and bring home her collar-bone."
When all these things had been gathered, the wife brought forth a son,
who was named Kujavarsuk by the old man, and the stone was put close to
his feet, but the bird was stuck up above the window. The old man now
told the father to provide a kayak for the boy as soon as he should be
able to make use of it, and have it ready fitted up with utensils and
all other requisites for the hunt. When the boy grew up, the father made
the kayak; and even before the skins with which it had been covered had
time to dry, it was put in the water, and the boy being placed in it,
they shoved it off the beach. The old man told what would happen to him,
saying, "The very first time he goes out, one of the 'quiet' seals will
rise to the surface, and he shall not return home till he has captured
ten of them; and in future he will always get ten seals whenever he goes
out kayaking. The old man and the father now followed him closely, but
as soon as they left him at a little distance a seal popped its head
above the water, and he paddled on and harpooned it, at which <span
id="page_150">p. 150</span> the old man was quite transported; and from
this time the boy began to hunt. When he was grown up he took two wives;
and he became of great use to his house-fellows and neighbours. In times
of need he was their only provider. One winter the sea was frozen over
very early, and ere long there was only one opening in the ice left,
right in front of their dwelling-place; out of this he every day got his
ten seals. Later on the cleft became so narrow that his kayak touched
the edge of the ice with both ends, and at last it altogether closed up.
The whole sea was now covered with ice; great perplexity came over the
people, and they deliberated whether it would not be necessary to call
in an angakok. One person mentioned that in the summer-time he had seen
the widow Igdlutsialik's daughter practising the angakok art in a lake.
Kujavarsuk at once sent off a messenger to let her know that he would
give her a large seal-skin in return if she would make the ice break up.
However, she declined to do so. They next tried to get her to return by
offering her different things, such as clothes and lamps; but still she
refused. Then some one brought her a handful of beads, which happened to
take her fancy; and she said to her mother, "Bring my summer dress."
When she had put it on, she walked down to the water-side and
disappeared among the loose ice-blocks scattered all along the
sea-shore. Shortly afterwards the spectators heard a splash, and she was
seen no more. She now remained in the depths of the ocean for three
days, and at the bottom of the sea she had a struggle with the old woman
(viz., the arnarkuagssâĸ of the Eskimo mythology), to make her let loose
the animals of the sea, which she purposely detained, and kept swimming
about underneath her lamp; and when at length she had managed to
conciliate her, she again returned to the earth. On the evening of the
third day she reappeared among the ice-blocks on the beach, and let the
people know that she wanted every other seal that <span id="page_151">p.
151</span> was caught, for herself, of those with the most beautiful
skin, as well as of the common *fiord seals*. As yet, however, the sea
was all covered with ice. But on the following morning, at dawn, the ice
broke up, and an opening appeared near the houses; and after a while it
had become so wide that the men could put down their kayaks. Each of
them soon caught two seals, but Kujavarsuk as usual got ten, which made
the others very jealous. It now happened one day that his wives had only
put by a piece of the back instead of the briskets for his mother's
brother, who was expected to come home later in the evening. He was
offended at this want of consideration on their part, and resolved to
make (by help of sorcery) a *tupilak* for Kujavarsuk. To this end he
gathered bones of all sorts of animals, out of which he fashioned it in
such manner that it could take the shape of different animals, of birds
as well as of seals; and having stirred them into life, he let it loose,
and ordered it to persecute Kujavarsuk. First it dived down into the
sea, and again appeared to him in the shape of a seal; but he was then
already on his way home, and when it approached him he was in the very
act of drawing his kayak on the shore. The same thing happened on the
second and the third day. The *tupilak* now determined to pursue him to
his house, and then frighten him to death. It transformed itself into a
*toogdlik*,<span id="page_151_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_151_note_1.md) and
commenced shrieking outside the house. Kujavarsuk went out; but as he
could not be brought to look at it, the charm would not work. It then
resolved to go underground, and pop up into the room. However, it
succeeded no better this time, but rose at the back of the house; and
just as it was about to climb up the roof, it met his own amulet-bird,
which at once set about picking and scratching its face. It now,
however, turned desperate, and thought, "Why did this miserable fool
<span id="page_152">p. 152</span> of a man ever make me!" and in the
height of its wrath it turned against its maker. Diving down into the
water near his fishing-place, it emerged right beneath his kayak, and
fairly upsetting it, devoured him on the spot. It now fled far away from
the habitations of man, out on the roaring ocean. Kujavarsuk afterwards
remained unmolested, and died at a very old age.

 

<span class="small">\[There are other tales of Kujavarsuk among the
Greenlanders. The following may be taken as a sample of the
whole.\]</span>

When Kujavarsuk had grown a man he travelled to a place in the north,
where he had had a namesake who died from starvation. The people of
those parts followed the pursuit of whale-fishery, and here Kujavarsuk
made friends with a youth. Those two were always trying to outdo each
other, but Kujavarsuk was more than a match for him. In the beginning of
winter they were to try who could detect the first whale. Kujavarsuk had
never seen any animal of this kind before. He had by this time taken up
his abode with an old man, who said to him, "When a whale is near at
hand, it cannot be mistaken; its breathing is at once roaring and
hissing." And Kujavarsuk was always on the alert to catch sight of them.
One fine morning, when it was quite calm, the old man said, "If the
whales are going to be early this year, they'll turn up on a day like
this." Kujavarsuk remained out in his kayak all day, listening for the
signal, but could not perceive any such sound at all. In the evening he
returned after a fair hunt, and tried to go to sleep, but was not able.
About midnight he rose, and stepping out he heard a sound of heavy
breathing from the sea coming closer to him, and stopping at the mouth
of the bay; and on entering he said, "I wonder what sound it was I heard
just now." The old man walked out, and returned, saying, <span
id="page_153">p. 153</span> "Why, that's just the whale blowing; he did
not miss his day." Kujavarsuk now went to rest, and slept soundly. But
early in the morning his young friend was heard calling without,
"Kujavarsuk, the whale is blowing! thou art too late!" But the old man
made answer, "Thou art mistaken, he knew it yesterday, and has just gone
to sleep." Soon after, the friend said, "Now let us see which of us is
the best hand at making bladders for our whale-catching." And next day
they went out together to procure seals for this purpose. Close to land
Kujavarsuk got two spotted ones, but his friend got none at all. As the
weather continued fine, and more whales appeared, the boats were sent
out on the watch. At first Kujavarsuk concluded he was not to be of the
party because he had no women to row his boat, but on seeing all the
hunters set off along with their housemates, women and all, he, too,
felt a strong desire to go; and getting hold of some children, he manned
his boat with them, and left shore. The other boats, meantime, had stood
farther out to sea, and the people shouted to him, "If thou art on the
look-out for the whale thou must come out to us; he'll never rise where
thou art now." But he did not mind them, and stayed where he was, his
mother having said, "I conceived thee on the sea-shore, and for this
reason thou shalt watch thy chance near it." In a little while a whale
appeared close by; he at once pursued and harpooned it, and the beast
could not even draw his bladder under the water. Again the others cried,
"If thou wilt not lose it thou must pursue it more seawards." But he
only replied, "All the animals of the sea that I am going to pursue will
seek towards shore, close to my dwelling-place." And thus he was left
alone to kill it all by himself. Whether he got any more than this one
is not known; but perhaps he even got his ten of them. When spring came
on he returned to his former <span id="page_154">p. 154</span> home,
where he still found the old fisherman alive, and to him he presented
all the whalebone; the longest and best splits having been all reserved
for him.
