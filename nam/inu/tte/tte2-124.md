124\. A G<span class="small">IRL NAMED</span> T<span
class="small">UAGTUANGUAK</span> fled from her brother-in-law, who
persecuted her. Running across the ice, she fell through; but having
again got up, she ran on and on to the north constantly, viewing a black
spot before her. Swooning several times, and again seeing the black spot
on awaking, she meanwhile acquired angakok power. Going on in this way
for five successive days, she came to a precipice, and setting out from
its edge, she leaped across, but was somehow wafted back through the air
to the same spot. This process she continued for five days. She then
pursued her journey north, and came to an inhabited place, where she
took up her abode, and afterwards got married. She visited the
ingnersuit, and received presents from them; but while carrying them
homewards the gifts were wafted out of her hands, and flew back to their
first owners.
