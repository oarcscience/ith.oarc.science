147\. T<span class="small">HE</span> O<span
class="small">CEAN</span>-S<span class="small">PIDER</span>.—A kayaker
in the firth of Godthaab once, at a place where no shoal was known to
exist, saw the bottom quite close to him. He then suddenly recollected
to have heard old people talking of the ocean-spider, a most dangerous
animal to the kayakers. Presently he discovered a monstrous eye, and at
the distance of about a kayak-paddle's length from it a similar one, and
on tearing away from the spot a terrible gap made its appearance.
Indeed, if he had been a less skilled kayaker, he would never have got
off alive.
