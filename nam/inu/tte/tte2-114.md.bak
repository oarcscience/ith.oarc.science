class="small">IRD</span> (*Alca impennis*), a story from South
Greenland.—Two young men with one elder companion lost their way when
kayaking in foggy weather, and having roamed about without being able to
sight any land, they came to a high promontory, showing one continuous
steep and inaccessible cliff, inhabited by crowds of isarukitsoks. By
following the coast they at last came to a landing-place, and found a
nice situation, where they rested themselves, and had their strength
restored by eating birds. Having also filled their kayaks with them,
they put off to sea again, and happened to pass by one of the monstrous
gulls which are in the habit of picking up the kayakers and giving them
as food to their young ones; but they reached their home in safety. It
is told that before the land of the isarukitsok sank there were plenty
of these birds about Nook (Godthaab).
