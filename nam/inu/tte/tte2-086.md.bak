### 86. THE DREAM AND CONVERSION OF AKAMALIK.

<span class="small">\[This tradition appears to rest upon an event
mentioned by Crantz in his 'Historie von Gronland,' p. 561, as having
taken place in the year 1743; but it is given here in a very much
abridged form, from two manuscripts, a great portion of which was merely
copied out from the New Testament, and some other religious
books.\]</span>

IN the days when missionaries had come to Nook (Goothaab with
New-Herrnhut), but people in other places were still heathens, there
lived in the south a clever and skilful seal-hunter, named Akamalik, who
had a cousin of whom he was very fond. However, it chanced that this
friend of his fell ill and died, which caused him much grief, and sorely
depressed his spirits. As chance would have it, the women of the place
at that time brought forth no sons, and his own wife being childless, he
could get no namesake for his deceased friend. He henceforth fell into
the habit of ill-treating his wife, kicking her and piercing her skin
with an awl. After some time it was rumoured that a woman of a
neighbouring place had borne a child and named it after his friend. On
hearing this, Akamalik at once hastened thither, and was so glad at
seeing the babe that he was quite unable to sleep for five succeeding
nights. Having returned home, sleep at length was again restored to him,
and then he dreamt as follows: Some one peeped <span id="page_435">p.
435</span> in at the window, and calling out for him, said that he was
to come and get his piece of blubber from a young whale which was just
being caught. He at once went out and followed the voice, the owner of
which he now perceived was a woman. In running after her he came across
a vast plain, stretching forth like the surface of the ocean, and
gradually rising. It became brighter and always brighter; he passed over
heaps of sand, rolling dreadfully like a mountain-river, and saw a crowd
of people playing at ball with a walrus-head. Akamalik would fain have
stopped and joined the players, but the woman hurried him on, and,
almost against his will, he constantly followed her. However, he
wondered greatly; for in those people, on close view, he plainly
recognised men who had died a number of years ago. He then came to three
high steps, which it appeared impossible to ascend; but merely looking
at his guide, he gave a leap and almost unwillingly mounted them. From
the top he again saw before him a great plain, and a crowd or people in
beautiful clothing; among them he recognised a man in the murder of whom
he himself had taken an active part many years ago, and could not but be
astonished at hearing people talk in answer to what he was thinking of
but had not yet spoken out. Voices were then heard calling the crowd to
divine service: the people all sallied forth, and he followed their
steps, passing over a dreadful abyss with fires burning down in the
depths; then they ascended still higher to a place so dazzlingly bright
and beautiful as he never had seen before. Here the Saviour Himself was
preaching and leading the song of innumerable people. The Saviour spoke
to Akamalik, reproaching him with his sins, at the same time pointing
out to him the abyss, where He told him that tornarsuk resided in the
depths, and advised him, saying, "Next summer thou must repair thee to
Nook for the purpose of getting instructed." The Saviour guided him on
his way back across the abyss, <span id="page_436">p. 436</span> <span

earth again he (viz., his soul) beheld his own poor body, walking
backwards and forwards all void of intellect, people believing him to be
mad. It appeared very uncouth in his sight, all covered with maggots;
but though he greatly abhorred it, he nevertheless entered into it,
having no other abode. Having thus put on the garb of his body, he
became like dead and lay in a swoon. By-and-by he recovered his reason,
and was awake. He then repented his profligate life, went to Nook in the
spring, and was baptised by the Moravian missionaries. He not only
became a Christian by name, but also a good man and a loving husband.
