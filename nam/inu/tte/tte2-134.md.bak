134\. A G<span class="small">IRL NAMED</span> I<span
class="small">SSERFIK</span> preferred animals to men. Lastly, she fell
in love with an eagle, that carried her off further inland. A man went
after them to fetch her back; but she excited the eagle against him. The
man sought refuge beneath a stone. The eagle began to peck at it with
its beak to make a hole in it; but the <span id="page_466">p. 466</span>
man sent out his amulet, killed the eagle, and carried Isserfik back to
her home, where she gave birth to a child, half man, half eagle.
Finally, she lost her mind and died.
