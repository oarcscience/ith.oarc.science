96\. K<span class="small">IGDLINARARSUK</span>, in order to avenge the
murder of his sister, went out in search of an old woman <span

for giving swiftness to a boat. The first one he came to replied, "I
have grown rather old to no purpose (viz., without having acquired
wisdom), I am only clever in ― ―,<span

an elder sister more cunning than I; first try thy luck with her, and if
thou dost not succeed I'll see what can be done." He then went farther,
and came to another old hag, who gave him for an amulet a small bit of a
dried Merganser (*Mergus serrator*). This he inserted in the prow of the
boat with such care that no marks or joints were visible. Twice he tried
it before the boat appeared swift enough to run down a flying Merganser,
and not till then did he start to encounter his adversaries.

<span id="page_445_note_1"></span>[1](#page_445_fr_1) The original words
I have not ventured to translate, sufficiently characteristic though
they are of the modesty which it is considered necessary by the Eskimo
to assume on such occasions as that described in the text. It would have
been scarcely possible for the old woman to have claimed skill in a
manufacture more lowly than that of which the words omitted would have
been a translation.
