136\. T<span class="small">HE</span> A<span
class="small">RNARKUAGSAK</span>.—An angakok performed a conjuration in
order to procure good seal-hunting. He went down to the old hag, the
arnarkuagsak, at the bottom of the sea, and found her in a great rage.
Having entered her abode, she seized hold of her hair behind one ear,
grasping some bloody clothes, and afterwards from behind the other one
she fetched down a crying baby, flinging both upon the floor. The
angakok then succeeded in propitiating her.
