95\. K<span class="small">ANGINGUAK</span> was a native of the south,
who set forth on a journey and took up his abode near Umanarsuak (Kin of
Sael, a high island of South Greenland). He had a son named Tunerak, who
was such an expert rower that he used to overtake the falcons in their
flight, and killed them with a blow of his paddle-oar. He went out to
sea so far as to make Umanarsuak appear like a seal diving up and down
among the waves. He also tried matches with celebrated kayakers, but on
one of these occasions he was killed by his rival. His father afterwards
went to the place where he was buried, brought out his body again and
carried it along with him, till he found an angakok, who restored it to
life.
