### 83. ATALIANGUAK.

ATALIANGUAK was an excellent seal-hunter, and lived as a bachelor in a
large house, together with several cousins. At spring-time he used to go
out all by himself in his boat in order to fish *angmagsat* (Capelins).
One evening when he returned to his tent, having been out kayaking, he
was much surprised at seeing a pretty little woman standing outside of
it. She wore a pair of white boots, and her hair-tuft was newly dressed.
Atalianguak ran quickly up beside her, and taking hold of her hand
brought her into the tent, and afterwards married her. When the fishing
season came to an end he repaired homewards in his boat, his wife
rowing, while he himself took the helm. In autumn he again settled down
in the house of his cousins. One evening just as his wife had risen from
her seat on the ledge to go outside, one of the other people, whom she
happened to pass by, remarked, "What a very peculiar <span
id="page_428">p. 428</span> smell I perceived;" but his housemates told
him to take great care not to offend her, as they had observed that she
was not a woman of *the common kind*. The same thing, however, happened
again; this time the little woman hearing them speak of a strange smell
rushed quickly out, and the moment she passed the doorway the people
observed a fox-tail dangling at her back. Atalianguak pursued her to the
border of a lake. In a fox-hole close by he noticed a light, and peeping
in he saw his wife sitting on a ledge. He called out, "I feel so cold,
let me come in." "Well, come." "But in what way am I to enter?" "Thou
hast only to breathe upon the entrance and thou wilt easily get in."
Thus be entered, and sitting down beside his wife, he exclaimed, "It is
dreadfully cold—do make me warm." At the same time be saw one of the
walls covered with flies, dirt-flies, beetles, and all kinds of
reptiles. She now raised up her head and ordered them to lull
Atalianguak to sleep, and presently they all began singing,
"Atalianguak, sleep, sleep; at spring we will rouse thee again:" and he
slept for ever so long. At last he awoke of his own accord, and when he
rose and went outside the sun was high in the sky, while the cave itself
swarmed with flies and reptiles. He went to make water, and forthwith it
turned to a whole river. From that time he gave up all thought of
womanhood.
