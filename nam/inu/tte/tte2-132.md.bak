132\. T<span class="small">HE</span> A<span
class="small">MAROK</span>.—A man who mourned the death of a relative
went out in hopes of finding some means of excitement; and being told
that an amarok had been heard roaring in the firth of Nook (Godthaab),
he could not be kept from going off to encounter the beast. Accompanied
by a relative, he went up the country, and finding the young ones of the
amarok, the mourner instantly killed the whole. But his companion,
getting terribly frightened, betook himself to a cave for refuge,
accompanied by the mourner. From their retreat the relative soon saw how
the old amarok came running, holding a whole reindeer between its jaws;
and having looked in vain for its young ones, it rushed down to the
lake, where it appeared to be hauling out something of a human shape. At
the same moment, turning round to his companion, he saw him falling
helpless to the ground. The amarok, from which nothing remains
concealed, had discovered him and taken the soul out of his body.
