107\. A<span class="small">VIGIATSIAK</span> was the name of a young
woman who, while grinding her knife on the beach, was taken by a whale.
After living for a time with the whales, she fled and was transformed
into a seal, living with the seals. As such she was caught by a man,
hauled upon the ice, and cut to pieces, all excepting the head, <span

thence she slipped into the womb of the man's wife who had harpooned
her, and was afterwards born anew, and called Avigiatsiak.
