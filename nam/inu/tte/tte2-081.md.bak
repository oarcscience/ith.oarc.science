### 81. THE DESERTED WOMAN AND HER FOSTER-DAUGHTER.

A WOMAN, who had no brothers or sisters, lived with a little
foster-daughter at the house of a great seal-hunter. The daughter was
very docile, and always obeyed at the least word. Once, during spring,
all the people belonging to the place went away fishing. The chief
hunter only lingered behind, harbouring wicked intentions. One calm
morning he went outside the house and re-entered, saying, "Pack up your
things; we must be ready to start." They now made all speed, and the
lonely woman was not the least busy among them—she worked away as she
never did before. When she had put her own poor bundles into the boat
<span id="page_421">p. 421</span> she hurried up for her ledge-cover;
but when she came outside again, she observed the foster-daughter still
standing on shore watching their master closely; and when she herself
came down he leaped into the boat, and shoving off, called out to them,
"Ye only eat our food; we won't take you along." So saying, their
housemates turned their backs upon them, and got under way. The poor
creatures, whose scanty belongings had all been put into the boat
excepting the ledge-cover, on seeing the boat depart, faced each other
in blank despair, and then burst into tears. However, when the boat was
out of sight, the widow wiped her eyes, and said, "Never mind, my dear;
we must just do without them." But the child was not so easily consoled.
When at length she stopped crying, her mother said, "Let us go and find
out a house to make our home." They went through all the deserted huts,
but everywhere the walls were bare and the hangings removed, till at
length they came into one without windows, where the skins still hung on
the walls, and the old one said, "Here, in the southern corner, we'll
take up our quarters." She at once proceeded to make a room of suitable
size, dividing it from the rest of the house with the skins. This done,
she continued, "Let us now go outside and try to find something to eat
at the flensing-place." She took the child by her hand, and they soon
found some small bits of blubber and skin, which they greedily devoured,
having had no food the whole day. After this meal they lay down to rest,
but were unable to sleep because of the cold. The next day, after a
similar search, they found the entrails of an entire seal. After this,
however, they found nothing more, and had only the entrails to live
upon.

It was just when the herds of seals are passing along the coast that
their stock of entrails was exhausted. One morning, having taken a small
morsel, they noticed that there was only a bit left for their supper at
night. <span id="page_422">p. 422</span> Then the widow said to her
daughter, "Child, thou art more strong and active than I: thou must go
and dig a hole over yonder beneath the window-ledge." The daughter
obeyed at once, and began to dig up the loose earth. When she had
finished, the mother repeated, "Thou art more brisk and active than I:
run away and fill the hole with water." The daughter continued fetching
water from the sea, and before evening the hole was filled. That evening
they took their last bit of food, and went to rest, but without being
able to sleep. In the early morning the mother said, "I shall probably
not succeed; still I think I will try to procure something (by magic)."
The daughter did not like the idea, nor did she believe in it; but the
mother rejoined, "When I commence my incantation, as I repeat it again
and again, thou must listen attentively." She soon began, and as she
went through it, warned her daughter to attend well. The child listened,
and presently heard a splash: on which she exclaimed, "Mother dear,
there is something moving in the water." When the old woman told her to
see what it was, she ran off to look, and seeing a little frog-fish,
called out, "Ah, mother, it is a frog-fish!" The mother told her to kill
it with the old grindstone (probably an amulet). The little girl obeyed,
and the fish was boiled and cut in two, putting aside one-half for their
evening meal. Next morning the mother repeated her incantation, and they
got a *nepisak-fish* (*Cyclopterus lumpus*); the next day, in the same
way, an eider-duck—and so on the following days, a firth-seal, a
saddleback-seal, a small dolphin, a white whale, and at last a narwal.
When she had done flensing the captured animals, the following day large
quantities of different kinds of provisions were heaped up outside the
house. Towards evening they went to the top of a rock sloping south to
cut the flesh in thin slices for drying. While there engaged the
daughter exclaimed, "I almost think I see a kayak coming in;" and in
this she was quite <span id="page_423">p. 423</span> right. The lonely
woman had one relative, a very aged man; and this poor fellow, having
lately heard of the manner in which she had been abandoned and left in
an empty house, now came to see if she had not starved to death,
bringing with him a frog-fish as a gift in case she was still alive.
When he saw the flensing-place all red with blood he could not believe
his own eyes, but thought it all a delusion. And when he observed the
two women standing on the rock and slicing large pieces of flesh for
drying, and when they afterwards came running down to receive him, he
accosted them, "Here am I, expecting to find you starved to death: I
actually came to bury you." She answered him, "Silly old thing thou art!
just get thee out of thy kayak, and partake of our good fare here." The
poor old man went ashore, but tasted nothing till he had pulled his
kayak properly up on the beach. The women had meanwhile boiled him a
nice dish. He took his fill for once; and when he wanted to start they
stuffed his kayak with such a supply that it was almost ready to sink.
On leaving he said, "As it is, there is no fear of your starving to
death; when all your provisions are ready prepared I shall come to fetch
you off." When he was gone they went to rest, and the morning after she
again made ready to practise her art. However, she chanted and invoked,
and chanted again, and the daughter watched and listened as usual, but
neither breathing nor splashing was heard. The reason was that they had
taken offence at her having made the gifts over to other people; and
from that time upwards she never succeeded in calling forth anything.
When her magic spell had wholly lost its effect, and she had finished
drying her stock of flesh, her poor old relative came and fetched her
off to his own homestead, and there she remained the rest of her days
with him.
