149\. K<span class="small">ATIGAGSE</span><span
id="page_471_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_471_note_2) had no faith in the
angakut, and sometimes, when attending their conjurations, he tore <span
id="page_472">p. 472</span> away the window-curtain, and thereby
dispelled all their doings. But once when an angakok had begun his
conjuration, and announced his tornak to be approaching in the shape of
a fire, Katigagse tore away the curtain which covered the entrance, and
ran outside. Suddenly he discovered a great flame rushing through the
air, which struck him with terror, and made him re-enter the house, and
trembling from head to foot cling to the rafters of the hut, from whence
fatigue soon made him fall to the ground. When the conjuration had been
finished, and the fire kept off, Katigagse was missed. At length they
brought him forth from underneath the ledge, all covered with filth, in
which state he left the house, never to attend angakok service any more.
