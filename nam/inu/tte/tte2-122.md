country. After returning home he often used to visit his son's grave.
Kayaking up the firth with this view, he once right before him saw an
inlander pulling himself through the water without any kayak ("using the
fog as kayak"), and after some angry words, he killed the inlander.
Another time, when he was again visiting the grave, he was surprised at
the sight of an inlander, who questioned him as to the cause of his
grief. "Yonder wretched heap of stones is the only object of my
distress," he answered. The inlander then told him how he also had, some
time ago, lost a son who had been seal-hunting. The old man made out
that it must have been the one he had killed; on which he pretended to
be expected home, pushed off in his skiff, and never more visited the
grave of his son.
