### VII.—I<span class="small">NFLUENCE OF</span> C<span class="small">ONTACT WITH</span> E<span class="small">UROPEANS</span>.

The natives of the Danish districts, whose numbers during last century
seem to have been greatly on the decrease, were afterwards, for a long
period, again increasing; while, since 1855, they have remained almost
stationary between 9400 and 9700 souls. They have long been
Christianised, and brought into a regular state of subjection to the
Danish Government, by means of the monopolised trade, the missionaries
and schools, as well as several other administrative institutions. The
introduction of intoxicating liquors, as well as those acts of violence
and oppression which in other countries have destroyed the primitive
races, especially those who live by hunting, have been here unknown.
Scarcely any other country will be found where the Europeans have shown
so much consideration for, and been so careful of, the uncivilised
natives as in this case. From the very beginning of the monopolised
trade, it has been carried on with a view to introduce and make
accessible to them such articles as were judged to be most necessary and
useful to them; and not without much hesitation have such articles of
luxury as bread, coffee, and sugar, besides tobacco, been sold to them.
By help of native schoolmasters, instruction is given to the children in
all the wintering place, except a few where the number of inhabitants is
too small. Attempts have been made to provide the natives with necessary
medicines, along with some medical aid, although the latter remains, of
course, very insufficient and illusory, on account of the extreme
distances; and finally, the Government has endeavoured to establish
regular institutions for the relief of the poor, and likewise taken
measures for the administration of justice and laws, as far as
circumstances would admit. Still, the general destructive influence of
nations at a far more advanced stage of culture upon those on a <span
id="page_77">p. 77</span> lower stage may here be traced—poverty,
combined with predisposition to certain diseases, having sensibly
increased. Greenland must be considered peculiarly adapted for making
closer inquiries as to the nature of this influence.

From the earliest times of the colonisation, Europeans of the working
classes have intermarried with native women, and formed their household
after the Greenland model, with merely a few European improvements.
These marriages have generally been rich in offspring; and have probably
become a concurring means of temporarily increasing the population, the
children, for the most part, growing up as complete Greenlanders. This
mixed offspring being now very numerous, and its individuals
representing the mixture of European and native blood in almost every
possible proportion, any marked distinction between the Europeans and
the natives might be supposed to have gradually disappeared. But the
real difference of nationality depending on education, not on physical
constitution, there are still sufficiently sharp distinctions to
indicate what we mean by Europeans and natives. The average number of
Europeans in the country, excepting at the time of existence of some
temporary establishments peculiarly European, has varied between 200 and
300.

When the natives saw the first Europeans approaching their country from
the sea in great ships, furnished with things all wonderful to them,
they can hardly have failed to combine the idea of something
supernatural with them. The Europeans, on their part, on settling down
in the country, in order to make their existence more secure, were
involuntarily led to abolish all native authority, especially that of
the angakut, and to suppress all kinds of national meetings. Religious
zeal—here of course, as everywhere else, combined with worldly and
social aims—and national prejudice tended to make them despise and
indiscriminately denounce all the native <span id="page_78">p. 78</span>
customs and institutions as heathenish; and in time, European authority
more and more became the principal law among them. From this abolition
of native laws and authority, and a kind of self-abasement and
disheartening consequently arising among them, the real or principal
source of the national evils must be considered to proceed.

Two national treasures yet remain to the natives, by means of which they
still maintain a kind of independence and national feeling—viz., their
language and their folk-lore. Through the tales, they also still
preserve a knowledge of their ancient religious opinions, combined
somewhat systematically with the Christian faith. Tornarsuk, in being
converted into the devil by the first missionaries, was only degraded,
getting in the meantime, on the other hand, his real existence confirmed
for ever. In consequence of this acknowledgment in part of tornarsuk,
the whole company of inue or spirits were also considered as still
existing. The ingnersuit were expressly charged by Egede as being the
devil's servants. The Christian heaven coming into collision with the
upper world of their ancestors, the natives very ingeniously placed it
above the latter, or, more strictly, beyond the blue sky. By making
tornarsuk the principle of evil, a total revolution was caused with
regard to the general notions of good and evil, the result of which was
to identify the idea of good with what was conformable to European
authority; but, unhappily, the rules and laws given by the Europeans
often varied with the individuals who successively arrived from Europe
quite ignorant of the natives. In the same way as the ancient belief in
the world of spirits has been kept up, the Greenlanders also maintain
their old faith respecting the aid to be got from it, and have
habitually recourse to it. The kayakers, in their troublesome and
hazardous occupation, still believe themselves taken care of by
invisible ingnersuit. Although the natives <span id="page_79">p.
79</span> are aware that the aid required from the spirit-world of the
angakut is opposed to Christianity, they still discern as clearly as
formerly between that and witchcraft. Only in rare instances have some
of the natives attempted to form a Christian community independent of
the Europeans, and founded on alleged immediate revelations from heaven;
but these efforts have been soon suppressed. No attempts have ever been
made to re-establish the ancient authority of the angakut.

Excepting the introduction of firearms, no essential change has taken
place in the hunting operations of the natives. The principal means of
subsistence are still procured in the same way as they were a thousand
years ago. It will also be evident that a consumption of from thirty to
forty pounds of bread annually per individual, besides coffee, sugar,
and tobacco, cannot have essentially contributed to change the habitual
food of the population. As to the rules regarding property, and the
distribution of the daily gains from hunting and fishing, some changes
must of course have arisen from the settling of Europeans among the
natives; besides, a great portion of the produce of the chase is now
turned into articles of trade. But still, the ancient principle of
mutual assistance and semi-communism, out of the feeling of clanship it
may be, still predominates among the Eskimo. When, however, the lazy and
the active, the skilled and the unskilled, fared the same, owing to this
division of the produce of the hunt, personal energy and activity
necessarily abated. As to the body of persons constituting the family,
the Europeans from the first made a practice of interfering with the
discipline exercised by the head member, and even with the choice of
husband or wife; while, at the same time, the children were not, as
before, invariably brought up to the national occupation of hunters and
fishers, and accordingly a temptation to waste the proceeds of the good
man's labour increased. As to the communities <span id="page_80">p.
80</span> comprising the inhabitants of the same house or the same
hamlet, their mutual relations have also necessarily been essentially
altered, partly in having members added to their band who did not
contribute to the common household, and also by their being enabled to
barter away their seal-oil, and even the flesh, for European articles,
principally such as would serve to improve their meals. On the other
hand, in cases of any particular want, public opinion still requires the
neighbouring seal-hunter to proffer his aid, if he had anything left
beyond his own needs for the day. In fact, the Europeans, and perhaps
those who are in their service, are now considered the only persons
really entitled to possess property to any extent, the native sooner or
later finding too much trouble in keeping what he may have saved up.
Probably, by way of lessening the demands made on a provider by his
house-fellows, a growing tendency has been observed in Greenland to make
the houses smaller; but still it is extraordinary how many persons are
entirely supported by a single man. All this taken into consideration,
the security for person and property, which ought to have been one of
the first advantages of the social order introduced by the Europeans,
though prospering on the whole, on closer investigation still shows
itself in some respects illusory as far as concerns the natives.

Although the general economical conditions of the Greenlanders now
present a somewhat disheartening picture, there remain various
circumstances which leave some ground for hope that they may regain
their former prosperity, and that contact with a people in a higher
stage of civilisation will prove no absolute hindrance to their
existence and welfare. Firstly, in many places we meet with pure natives
who have been able to combine the industry of their ancestors with the
advantage to be derived from the use of European articles which are now
for sale, and by means of these have established a household <span
id="page_81">p. 81</span> undoubtedly preferable to that which formed
the highest stage of comfortable life among the ancient Greenlanders.
Next, it must be noticed that in many families the children even of
European fathers, who are more exposed than other natives to the
influence of European habits, and also to the use of European articles,
have often become the most able kayakers and industrious seal-hunters.
Next, it must be remarked that the natives show a great aptitude for
learning, and are anxious to profit by the instruction imparted at
schools, regular school attendance being perhaps in no country more
popular than in Greenland; and lastly, it has been proved by experience
that the natives themselves are acquiring a notion of the benefit
arising from suitable laws and social institutions, which are necessary
for the bringing about a more regulated way of making those habits which
are inseparable from their trade and mode of life conformable to their
relation with the Europeans.
