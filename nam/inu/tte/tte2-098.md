98\. A<span class="small">TARSUATSIAK</span> and his brothers were a set
of fearful manslayers, living in the country about Upernivik
(Greenland), who had their heads tattooed with a separate mark for each
murder they had committed. On Atarsuatsiak these marks formed a whole
row along his forehead from one side to the other. At last the people of
the neighbouring places resolved upon having him killed at a place to
which he used to resort in order to visit his concubine.
