### 54. STORIES ABOUT THE ANCIENT KAVDLUNAIT.

<span class="small">\[The four following tales are given in one section
on account of their more local character, being known only to the west
Greenlanders, especially the southernmost of them, and representing the
only trace of intelligence left concerning the ancient Scandinavian
settlers which the author has been able to discover by inquiries made in
the country.\]</span>

 

(1.) UNGORTOK, THE CHIEF OF KAKORTOK.

IT once happened that a kayaker from Arpatsivik came rowing up the
firth, trying his new bird-javelin as he went along. On approaching
Kakortok, where the first *Kavdlunait*<span
id="page_308_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_308_note_1.md) had taken up their <span
id="page_309">p. 309</span> <span id="p309"></span>{see [picture](p309.md)
on page 309} <span id="page_310">p. 310</span> abode, he saw one of them
gathering shells on the beach, and presently he called out to him, "Let
us see whether thou canst hit me with thy lance." The kayaker would not
comply, although the other continued asking him. At last, however, the
master of the place, named Ungortok, made his appearance, and said,
"Since he seems so very anxious about it, take good aim at him;" and
soon the kayaker sent out his spear in good earnest, and killed him on
the spot. Ungortok, however, did not reproach him, but only said, "It
certainly is no fault of thine, since thou hast only done as thou wast
bidden." When winter came, it was a general belief that the Kavdlunait
would come and avenge the death of their countryman; but summer came
round again; and even two summers passed quickly by. At the beginning of
the third winter, the same kayaker again rowed up to Kakortok, provided
with the usual hunting tools, bladder and all. This time he again
happened to see a Kavdlunak gathering shells, and somehow he took a
fancy to kill him too. He rowed up towards him on that side where the
sun was shining full upon the water, and launching his spear at him,
killed him at once, upon which he returned home unobserved, and told how
he had done away with one of the Kavdlunait. They reproached him with
not having let their chief know of this; and the murderer answered them,
"The first time I only killed him because I was asked over and over
again to do so." Some time after this occurrence, a girl was sent out to
draw water in the evening; but while she was filling the pail, she
noticed the reflection of something red down in the water. At first she
thought it to be the reflection of her own face; but turning round, she
was horrified at seeing a great crowd of Kavdlunait. She was so
confounded that she left the pail behind, and hurried into the house to
tell what had happened. At the same time the enemies posted themselves
in front of the door <span id="page_311">p. 311</span> and the windows.
One of the inmates instantly ran out, but was soon killed with an axe,
and cast aside. They were all despatched in this way: only two brothers
remained unhurt. They happily escaped out on the ice. The Kavdlunait,
however, soon caught sight of them, saying, "Those are the last of the
lot; let us be after them;" and at once began the pursuit. The leader
now said, "I am the quickest of you; let me start after them;" and he
followed them out on the ice, where the speed of the brothers had been
greatly retarded owing to the younger one having got new soles to his
boots, which made them slippery, and caused him often to lose his
footing. At length they reached the opposite shore, and Kaisape (pron.
Kysapee), the elder, succeeded in climbing the icy beach; but the
younger fell, and was quickly overtaken. Ungortok cut off his left arm,
and

![](311.jpg)

held it up before his brother, saying, "Kaisape! as long as thou livest
thou won't surely forget thy poor brother." Kaisape, who was not armed,
could render him no assistance, but quickly took to his heels. He
crossed the country for Kangermiutsiak, where his father-in-law was
living. Here he remained all winter, and was presented with a kayak. In
summer he kayaked southward to learn some magic lay that had power to
charm his enemies. He again wintered at Kangermiutsiak; but when the
summer came round he went away to the north, in order to find himself a
companion. At every <span id="page_312">p. 312</span> place he came to,
he first inquired if there happened to be a couple of brothers, and then
he went on to examine the inside fur of their boots to see whether they
had any lice in them; and he travelled far and wide before he found two
brothers, of whom the younger one was altogether without lice. This one
he persuaded to assist him, and made him return with him to
Kangermiutsiak. He was now very intent on catching seals; and of all he
caught he had the hairs removed from the skins, which were then used for
white skins. This done, he went out in search of a large piece of
driftwood, and at last found one to suit his purpose. He now proceeded
to excavate it with his knife until it was all hollow like a tube, and
made a cover to fit tightly at one end; and both sides he furnished with
little holes, for which he also made stoppers of wood. Being thus far
ready, he first put all the white skins inside the hollow space, shut it
up at the end with the cover, and likewise closed the little side holes.
He then put it down into the water, upon which all the kayakers joined
in towing it down the inlet to Pingiviarnek, where they landed it; and
having got out the skins, attached strings to them, then hoisted and
spread them like sails, so that the boat came to have the appearance of
a somewhat dirty iceberg, the skins being not all alike white. The
people now got in: it was pushed off from land, and Kaisape gave the
order, "Let the skins be spread!" This was accordingly done; and the
people on shore were astonished to see how very like it was to an
iceberg floating slowly along. Kaisape, who wanted to take a survey of
the whole from shore, said to the crew, "Now ye can take the boat out
yourselves, while I step ashore to have a look at it." When he beheld
the work of his hands, he was well pleased with it, and ordered the boat
to load again. The skins were all spread out to dry in the sun; and when
this had been done, he remarked that he had not yet forgotten his
brother. <span id="page_313">p. 313</span> They were now ready to go to
Kakortok and have their revenge, but for some time they were obliged to
station themselves at Arpatsivik, waiting a favourable wind to carry
them up the inlet. When the fair wind had set in, the firth gradually
filled with broken bits of ice of different form and size. Now was the
time for Kaisape to spread all sail and get in. Several boats followed
in his wake, but the crews landed a little north of Kakortok to gather
fagots of juniper; while Kaisape and his helpmates, well hidden in the
hollow wood, and keeping a constant look-out through the peep-holes,
drifted straight on towards the house. They saw the Kavdlunait go to and
fro, now and then taking a look down the inlet. Once they distinctly
heard it announced, "The *Kaladlit* (plur. of **kalâleĸ**, a
Greenlander) are coming:" upon which they all came running out of the
house; but when the master had reassured them, saying, "It is nothing
but ice," they again retired; and Kaisape said, "Now, quick! they won't
be coming out for a while, I think." They got out on shore; and, well
loaded with juniper fagots, they all surrounded the house. Kaisape
filled up the doorway with fuel, and then stuck fire to it, so that all
the people inside were burned; and those who tried to make their escape
through the passage were also consumed. But Kaisape cared little for the
people in general; his thoughts all centred in Ungortok; and he now
heard one of his helpmates exclaiming, "Kaisape! the man whom thou
seekest is up there." The chief had by this time left the burning house
through a window, and was flying with his little son in his arms.
Kaisape went off in pursuit of him, and approached him rapidly. On
reaching the lake, the father threw his child into the water that it
might rather die unwounded. Kaisape, however, not being able to overtake
his antagonist, was forced to return to his crew. Ungortok ran on till
he reached Igaliko, and there established himself with another chief
<span id="page_314">p. 314</span> <span id="p314"></span>{see
[picture](p314.md) on page 314} <span id="page_315">p. 315</span> named
Olave. On finding that Kaisape would not leave him at peace there, he
removed to the head of the firth Agdluitsok, where he settled at
Sioralik, while Kaisape established himself at the outlet of the same
firth. The following summer he again left in pursuit of Ungortok, who,
however, succeeded in getting to the coast opposite the island of Aluk.
Kaisape traced him right along to the north side of the same island,
where he took up his abode; and he now consulted the Eastlanders with
regard to some means of killing Ungortok. At last one stood forth,
saying, "I will get thee a bit of wood from a barren woman's boot-shelf,
out of which thou must shape thine arrow." Having pronounced some spell
upon it, he handed it over to Kaisape, who acknowledged the gift saying,
"If it comes true that this shall help me, I will be bound to give thee
my aid in hunting and fishing." He now went on making as many arrows as
could be contained in a quiver fashioned out of a sealskin; and last of
all, he added the precious charmed one, and then with his helpmates left
for the great lake in front of Ungortok's house, where Kaisape stuck all
the arrows in the ground at a certain distance from each other; and
finally also the charmed one. He let his companion remain below by the
lake, and cautiously mounted some high hills by himself, from whence he
could see Ungortok striding to and fro outside his house. He heard him
talk to himself, and mention the name of Kaisape. However, he resolved
to await the coming of night to carry out his purpose. In the dusk he
stole away to the house, and looked in at the window, holding his bow
ready bent. Ungortok was passing up and down as swiftly as a shadow, on
account of which it was impossible for him to take a sure aim. He
therefore levelled his bow at Ungortok's wife, who lay sleeping with a
baby at her breast. Ungortok, hearing a noise, gave a look at his wife,
and perceived the arrow sticking fast in her throat. Meantime <span
id="page_316">p. 316</span> Kaisape had quickly run back to the margin
of the lake to fetch another arrow, while Ungortok sped after him with
uplifted arm holding the axe that had formerly killed his brother in
readiness for himself. Kaisape launched his second arrow at him, but
Ungortok escaped it by falling down and making himself so thin that
nothing but his chin remained visible; and before long

![](316.jpg)

Kaisape had spent all his arrows, without having hit his mark. Ungortok
broke them in twain, and threw them into the lake. But at last Kaisape
caught hold of the charmed arrow, and this went straight through the
<span id="page_317">p. 317</span> protruding chin down into the throat.
As Ungortok did not, however, expire immediately, Kaisape took flight,
but was shortly followed by the wounded Ungortok. Kaisape had been
running on for a good long while, when all of a sudden he felt his
throat getting dry, and fell down totally exhausted. Remembering
Ungortok, however, he soon rose again, and running back to see what had
become of him, found his dead body lying close by. He now cut off his
right arm, and holding it up before the dead man, repeated his own
words, "Behold this arm, which thou,wilt surely never forget!" He also
killed the orphan child; and taking the old Eastlander with him, he
travelled back to Kangermiutsiak, where he sustained the old man, whose
bones, according to report, were laid to rest in that same place.

 

(2.) THE FIRST MEETING OF THE KALADLIT WITH THE ANCIENT KAVDLUNAIT IN
GREENLAND.

In former times, when the coast was less peopled than now, a boat's crew
landed at Nook (Godthaab). They found no people, and traversed the fiord
to Kangersunek. Half-way up to the east of Kornok, near Kangiusak, they
came upon a large house; but on getting closer to it, they did not know
what to make of the people, seeing that they were not Kaladlit. In this
manner they had quite unexpectedly come across the first Kavdlunak
settlers. These likewise for the first time saw the natives of the
country, and treated them kindly and civilly; but the Greenlanders
nevertheless feared them, and made for their boats. On getting farther
up the fiord, they found many Kavdlunait stationed. However, they did
not put in anywhere, but hastened away as fast as possible. When the
boat and its crew returned from their summer trip in the fiord, <span
id="page_318">p. 318</span> they told their countrymen all around of
their encounter with the foreigners, and many of them now travelled up
to see them. Many boats having thus reached Kangersunek, they now began
to have intercourse with the Kavdlunait, seeing that they were well
disposed towards them. Later on in the summer, many more Kaladlit
arrived, and the foreigners began to learn their language. At Kapisilik
a Kavdlunak and a Kalalek, it is said, became such fast friends that
they would not be separated, but were constantly together. They tried to
excel each other at different games and feats of dexterity; and their
countrymen on both sides were greatly diverted as lookers-on; but being
both first-rate archers, their arrows always fell side by side. One day
the Kavdlunak said, "Come, let us climb yon lofty hill; but first we
will stretch a skin for a target to aim at on that little islet yonder;
then we will try which of us can hit the mark. He who fails shall be
thrown down the precipice, and the other remain the conqueror." The
Kalalek answered, "No, I will not agree to that, because we are friends,
and none of us shall perish." But the Kavdlunak persisted so long that
his own countrymen at last said, "Well, let him be thrown down as it is
at his own will;" and the Kalalek at last gave in, and they climbed the
mountain together, accompanied by a crowd of spectators. The Kavdlunak
was the first to shoot, but altogether failed; then the Kalalek came in
for his turn, and pierced the skin in the centre. According to his own
desire, the Kavdlunak was hurled down the precipice, and his countrymen
only thought it served him right for having thus recklessly pledged his
life. From that day until the present this mountain has been called
Pisigsarfik (the shooting-place).

<span class="small">N<span class="small">OTE</span>.—The two preceding
stories are compiled from six different manuscripts, in which the
contents of both are partly mixed up, and the same events have been
localised for each of the two tracts of coastland in which ruins of the
old settlements are still to be seen—viz., the district <span
id="page_319">p. 319</span> of Julianehaab, now most generally supposed
to have been the old Easterbygd, and the district of Godthaab,
identified with the ancient Westerbygd. The second story, however, is
only told by the Godthaab narrators, who appear to have linked the first
one to it, having previously altered and adapted it for their homestead
fiords of Kapisilik, Pisigsarfik, and Ameralik, and inserted the tale of
Navaranak (see [No. 18](tte2-018).md) to explain the beginning of the
warfare. The name Kakortok signifies Julianehaab itself; as also some
very remarkable Scandinavian ruins about eight miles distant from it.
Arpatsivik is an island between these places, upon which some very
ancient sod-covered Eskimo ruins are still to be seen, and are pointed
out as Kaisape's house.</span>

 

(3.) THE ANCIENT KAVDLUNAIT'S RUIN NEAR ARSUT.

A kayaker one day went to the bay of Iminguit to catch thong-seals.
Arriving there he observed a tent belonging to some Kavdlunait. He heard
them jesting and prating inside, and was strongly minded to go and look
in upon them. Accordingly be left his kayak, went up to the place, and
began to strike on the sides of the tent. This made them apprehensive,
and they now became quiet, which only encouraged him to continue all the
more, until he succeeded in silencing them altogether. Then he took a
peep in at them, and behold! they were all dead with fear. At Ikat, the
Kavdlunait living there were also taken by surprise by the Kaladlit, and
four fathers fled with their children out upon the ice, which, however,
being too thin, broke through with them, so that all were drowned; and
it is said that only a few years ago they might be seen at the bottom of
the sea. It is a common tradition at Arsut, that whenever they become
visible it is a sure foreboding that one of the people will die.

(4.) ENCOUNTER OF KALADLIT WITH THE ANCIENT KAVDLUNAIT ON THE ICE.

<span class="small">\[A tale received from North Greenland.\]</span>

It is said that the Kaladlit of the south country at times were attacked
in the autumn season, when the lakes were frozen over, and the sea-shore
was all bordered with ice. It once happened that a man had been out
hunting, and came home with two white whales. In the evening a couple of
girls came running into the house crying, "The enemy is coming upon us!"
At which the man got into a passion, and tore the fishing-line which he
was busily winding up. But when he was about to go out, the Kavdlunait
were already making an onset upon the house. The housewife, who had been
newly delivered of a child, was by means of sorcery got through a
window, and several escaped the same way; but all those who attempted to
get through the entrance were miserably killed. The master of the house,
who had escaped along with his wife, returned to bring his mother out,
but finding her badly wounded had to leave her to her fate. Some had in
this manner escaped, and hastened away to hide themselves among the
stoneheaps, from whence they heard the enemy's wild shouts of triumph.
And the man had to witness his mother being dragged across the frozen
lake by a rope fastened to her tuft of hair. Though greatly enraged, he
tried to keep quiet in his hiding-place, but ordered the two girls down
on the ice, saying, "Now ye go on to the edge of the water, and when
they overtake you plunge yourselves into the sea." Sobbing and crying,
they did as they were bid. No sooner had they been observed by the
Kavdlunait than they were seen to run out after them; but the ice was
too slippery for them, and they lost their footing. Some fell on their
backs, others <span id="page_321">p. 321</span> sideways, and some went
tottering about. The angry Kalalek now asked his people how many of the
enemy had gone out on the ice, and whether any of them were still on
shore. About this, however, they did not agree; but at last one of them
said, "That all of them had now got down." Immediately the furious
Kalalek rushed out on the ice, spear in hand, and another one in store.
The first of the Kavdlunait he met with was instantly speared; the
others fell on approaching him, and were likewise killed. When the point
of his spear had got too sticky with blood, he would only take time to
blow it away; and before the girls had reached the open sea, he had
despatched the whole of them. However, he turned back again, and pierced
them through their bellies, in order to complete his vengeance, and then
returned to the house, where he found the inmates all killed.
