106\. T<span class="small">HE</span> V<span class="small">ISITING</span>
A<span class="small">NIMALS</span>.—An old man, while staying in a firth
to fish for salmon, lost his son, who died at some distance up the
country. In his grief he could not persuade himself to leave his son's
grave, and he therefore put up his winter-house on the spot. In this
lonely abode they were once surprised by seeing three men entering the
house, one of them tall and long-nosed, the other smaller and with a
flat nose, and the last of very small stature and white as snow. After
passing the evening talking with the host, the short-nosed man, before
starting, asked for a piece of sole-leather, and the white one wanted a
piece of walrus-tooth. The old man saw the departing visitors out, but
when they left him, stood dumfoundered at seeing them bounding off in
the shape of a reindeer, a fox, and a hare. It is said that the hare had
need of something for a new tooth.
