<P class=indent>103. A<SMALL>KLAUJAK, A</SMALL> T<SMALL>ALE FROM</SMALL> L<SMALL>ABRADOR</SMALL>.&#8212;A man named Aklaujak was of immense strength. Once, when away on a reindeer-hunt, his brothers robbed him of his wife. But the mother, who from a high hill observed him sitting in his kayak and seizing two large reindeers by the antlers and drowning them by holding them under water, hastened down and persuaded the wife to return to him, on which the brothers took flight.</P>
