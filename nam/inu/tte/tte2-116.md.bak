116\. T<span class="small">HE</span> K<span
class="small">UINASARINOOK</span>.—Uvnek, one of the last angakut at the
firth of Godthaab, on one of his spirit-flights narrowly escaped being
taken by an *amarsiniook*. After his return he once performed a
conjuration and summoned the *amarsiniook*. A brightness was observed,
and a voice was heard from above the house saying, "If thou hadst not
happened to be an angakok thou wouldst never have escaped; it was I who
killed the *kuinasarinook* (another monster, dwelling in certain
mountains), because it had torn a man to pieces." The auditors then
remembered how some time ago a man had been found dead, and his body
terribly mutilated; but nobody had been able to make out how the murder
was committed, till it was thus explained by Uvnek.
