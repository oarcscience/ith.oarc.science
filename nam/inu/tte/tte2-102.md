102\. A T<span class="small">ALE FROM</span> L<span
class="small">ABRADOR</span>.—Sikuliarsiujuitsok, on account of his
great size, was unable to walk upon new ice. He, all by himself, caught
a whale from his kayak. But he was much dreaded and hated, and never
ventured to sleep in strange places. He was, however, once persuaded to
stay for a night in a snow-hut; and being too big to find room in it, he
lay all doubled up, and allowed his feet to be tied together. In this
condition he was hauled out and killed, but not before he himself had
killed four men in the struggle. He had three sisters, one of whom had
three sons, likewise powerful men. They had an enclosure, fenced in with
stones, into which they enticed all those they intended to kill.
