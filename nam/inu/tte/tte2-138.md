138\. T<span class="small">HE</span> B<span class="small">LOODY</span>
R<span class="small">OCK</span>.—At a certain wintering-place all the
men successively disappeared on going out. Two young lads who were still
left, while roaming about came to a mountain continually turning round,
and on one side all bloody. One youth tried the bloody path, but fell
down and perished. The other waited till the bloody side turned away
from him, and climbing gained the summit, when he found a house, and a
man who lived by hunting eider-ducks in a lake. After having stayed some
time, and rendered assistance to this man, he returned home safely.
