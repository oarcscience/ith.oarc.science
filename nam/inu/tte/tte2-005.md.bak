### 5. AKIGSIAK.

<span class="small">\[Of this tale six different copies have been
received. It seems in a very remarkable way to refer to certain
historical facts in regard to the intercourse between the Indians and
the Eskimo, and is in some measure analogous to the folk-lore of several
other nations, ascribing certain great actions, especially such as the
defeating of some monstrous and dreadful animal, to one special hero.
The text, however, is here given in an abridged form, the story itself
not being very interesting.\]</span>

IN days of yore it once happened that some people went far into a firth
to fish for salmon, and at the time one of the women was carried off by
an inlander, and was taken by him to a very remote place. She belonged
to the coast people, but afterwards married the man who carried her off,
and they begat a son, who was named Akigsiak. In his boyhood two of his
father's nephews were his constant playfellows. They often used to box
and fight each other, but Akigsiak soon outdid them completely; even in
swiftness his friends did not surpass him. As his mother belonged to the
coast people, while his father was from the interior of the country, he
was smaller of growth; but notwithstanding, he was respected and feared
by the other inlanders, and had a great reputation for strength and
ability in hunting. Akigsiak used to seek intercourse with the coast
people in order to gain information concerning his mother's relatives;
and at such a meeting he once told them as follows: "When my father grew
older he was incapable of providing for us. One winter we had a great
famine, and every day I went out in search of provisions; and meanwhile
my father watched me from the tops of the highest mountains, at the same
time taking note of any change in the weather, and as soon as the sky
darkened he made me a signal that I could hear far <span
id="page_117">p. 117</span> and wide, after which I took my way
homewards. He also gave me several instructions, and said I might go
anywhere excepting to the north, because of a monstrous reptile that was
reported to ravage those parts. One day my father gave me the signal;
but not even having had a chance of killing any game, I did not obey his
call. Afterwards, when I was going to return home, the storm overtook
me, and I could hardly see anything on account of the wind and the
snow-drifts, and consequently lost my way. Wandering about in this
manner, I at length discovered something that appeared to me like two
large windows of a house; then I saw that the other parts were like a
hill; and finally I saw that this was the terrible reptile against which
my father had warned me. I at once took to flight. However, he had
already seen me, and pursued me; but whenever he came up I leapt across
him, and striking him with my lance, I continued running. At last,
however, turning round to look for him, and noticing that he was quite
close upon me, I cried aloud with fatigue, and falling to the ground, I
lost my senses. I was soon awakened by a cool touch upon my face, and at
once remembered the monster reptile. Looking about for him, I beheld him
lying close to my feet. With my eyes constantly fixed upon him, I very
cautiously crept away; and as he did not even move, I rose to my feet
and walked on: but I did not reach my home until the fourth day, and had
been given up for lost. On entering the house my father said, 'Our
housemates have got nothing to help thee with.' But I told him that I
had barely escaped from the reptile, and that apparently I had left him
dead; and then my father said, 'The body of the reptile is said to
consist of nothing but fat;' and he added, 'our house-fellows are almost
starving.' These were now informed of what had happened, and they went
out in search of the monster; but many of them died before they reached
the spot—some just outside their houses <span id="page_118">p.
118</span> others farther away, till the whole road was covered with
dead bodies. But those who reached the reptile flensed away at him, and
found him to consist principally of fat, mixed with a little lean flesh.
They afterwards had it for food the whole winter." This was Akigsiak's
report at his first meeting with the coast people.

The next time he told how he had once been away on an excursion with his
father, and that on approaching the sea-shore they observed a whale
close outside, and a number of coast people standing on the beach. By
his father's orders he ran down and made an old man teach him a magic
lay for luring the whale up the river. As soon as the whale had entered
the river a crowd of inlanders appeared; but before they had been able
to penetrate the skin of the whale with their harpoons, Akigsiak ran off
home in order to fetch his weapons. Though he had to round three large
bays on his way, he was still in good time to despatch the whale after
his return, and then proceeded to give everybody his share of it, not
forgetting the old coast man, whom he protected against the inlanders.
At the third meeting he went on to tell how, having once heard that some
other inlanders had caught an immense fish the shape of a salmon, he
hurried down to the river-side and threw his harpoon also into the fish,
but that his companions being too few, the other inlanders stationed on
the opposite side succeeded in hauling it from them. He then hastened on
to a place where the river was somewhat narrower, and in jumping across
hurled himself round, head over heels, before he alighted on his feet at
the opposite shore. There he soon frightened away the other inlanders,
took his share of the fish—which he threw across to his own people on
the other side—and then jumped back in the same way he had come. At his
fourth meeting with the coast people, Akigsiak told them about a quarrel
he once had with an *igalilik* (viz., "pot-bearer," certain fabulous
inlanders <span id="page_119">p. 119</span> carrying boiling pots on
their shoulders), whom he had pushed down a precipice, crushing him to
death against the rocks. At last, Akigsiak met with an *inorusek*
(another kind of gigantic inlanders) on the high banks of a river. While
they were amusing themselves with throwing stones, the inorusek
persuaded him to try to hit a kayaker just passing by below, whom he did
not fail to kill on the spot. Akigsiak, repenting himself of his deed,
afterwards slew the inorusek, but is said never from this time to have
ventured himself among the coast people again, because of the murder he
had committed. Only once, they say, did he go to visit a certain coast
man, who lived on the banks of a river, in order to try a boxing-match
and a race with him. Although he was said to be a smaller man than the
other inlanders, he was at all events larger than our people; his back
was as broad as that of two others put together, and his height very
little less than two people on top of each other.
