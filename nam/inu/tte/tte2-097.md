97\. A M<span class="small">AN LIVING ON</span> K<span
class="small">ARUSUK</span> (in the firth of Goothaab) every day used to
repair to Kangek (about 24 miles distant) for the purpose of hunting
auks. For his companion he had an ingnersuak, who at the same time was
the tornak of an angakok, living farther up the firth at Tukak. It is
said that even nowadays many kayakers have an ingnersuak for their
companion, and every now and then they become visible. Sometimes a
kayaker observing two distinct kayaks at a distance, on coming nearer
will only meet with one, who on being questioned is not aware of any
other having been with him. In such cases people believe it to have been
an ingnersuak, on account of their being invisible, excepting from a
great distance. The said ingnersuak in the short winter days came to
Karusuk, waited until he saw the man ready to start for Kangek, and then
followed, and took care of him the whole day, and returned <span

to his home at Tukak.
