### 18. NAVARANAK OR JAVRAGANAK.

<span class="small">\[This apparently historical tradition has been
given in two separate narratives, the original copies not agreeing
sufficiently to admit of their being combined into one, although they
have evidently sprung from the same source. The variants of this tale
exemplify in a very remarkable manner how the narrators have practised
their habit of localising events. The first copy is one from North
Greenland, where the inlanders are meant to represent the fabulous
inhabitants of the interior of Greenland; the second is one from
Labrador, in which the native Indians of that country are plainly
alluded to; and it is very remarkable that a third record of the same
events has been received from South Greenland, in which the inlanders
are represented as being identical with the ancient Scandinavian
settlers in those parts of the country.\]</span>

THE inlanders and the coast-people in the beginning were friends. A
servant-maid called Navaranak used to be sent out by the inlanders to
the coast-people in order to fetch back *matak* (edible whale-skin), and
in exchange brought them reindeer-tallow; but after a time she grew
weary of this work, and resolved to free herself by making them enemies.
For this purpose she told the inlanders that the coast-people were going
to attack them, and to the coasters she asserted that the inlanders were
making ready to invade them. At length she provoked the inlanders to
such a degree that they resolved upon attacking the coast-people. They
chose a time when they were well aware that the men had all gone out
hunting; and, accompanied by Navaranak, fell upon the helpless women and
children. In their fright some of the mothers killed their own children,
but one woman who was pregnant fled down beneath the ledge; and when
Navaranak was sent back by the inlanders to find her out, she promised
her all she possessed not to betray her. Some also escaped by hiding
themselves among the rocks, but all the rest were killed. When the men
<span id="page_175">p. 175</span> returned, those who were left alive
ran down and told them what had happened; and on coming up from the
beach to their houses and beholding all their dead, the men were almost
desperate. When the time came for flensing and cutting up the whale,
Navaranak did not arrive as usual; she seemed to have disappeared
altogether. When summer had again come round, the men prepared a great
many arrows, and set out for the interior to take revenge on the
inlanders. On their way they called out, as was their wont, "Navaranak,
come on; we have got matak for thee!" but no one appeared. Again they
went on a good distance, and then repeatedly called out, "Navaranak,"
&c. And this time she answered the summons, and went up to them. On
noticing their arrows, she was about to take flight. Reassuring her,
however, they told her she had no need to do that. When she had ventured
quite close to them, they asked her where her countrymen were to be
found, and she said, "Further away in the interior of the country!" but
now they made her fast to a rope, and dragged her along with them until
she perished. At length they arrived at a very large lake, where the
tents of the inlanders were pitched all around, and they saw people
going out and in. But they waited till all had entered the tents, and
then they made their attack. Arrows came flying from both sides; but
those of the inlanders soon grew fewer in number, and the coast-people
remained all unwounded. When they had done with the men, they went
inside, killing women and children; and having thus satisfied their
revenge, returned to their homes.

 

<span class="small">\[On the island of Okak, in Labrador, this tale is
told as follows:—\]</span>

At Kivalek, on the island of Okak, there once lived a great many people,
among whom was an Indian woman named Javraganak. From her childhood she
had been <span id="page_176">p. 176</span> living with the coast-people,
whose servant she was; but nevertheless she had always remained a
stranger among them. One day when she was hungry, and longed for one of
her Indian dishes, she said, "At Pangma my countrymen have plenty of
tongues;" upon which an old man sneeringly replied, "I daresay thou hast
many brothers and relatives away there; thou hadst better make them come
over here,"—and at night she wandered away to give them warning. In
those times hares were very abundant, and sometimes you might even hear
them run about on the house-tops. One night when Javraganak had come
with a great number of her countrymen, those within heard a murmuring
sound outside, and the old man said, "Well, if that is not the hares
again! They are very lively, it seems." Besides him there was not a man
at home; they were all out hunting. And so it happened that all the
inhabitants were put to death by Javraganak's Indian countrymen. Many of
them sought refuge in a cave, where some were suffocated and others
murdered. On their return the men found their wives and children all
killed; but shortly afterwards they set out to kill the murderers. Among
these men was an angakok, who made a road for them right through a
mountain, and the countrymen of Javraganak were all destroyed. She,
however, was not to be found, having gone to hide herself; but the men
had great trust in their angakok. At last a man happened to call out,
"How I wish that Javraganak would serve me again!" upon which she
immediately appeared, looking very comfortable. But they soon all fell
upon her, wound a cord around her body, and dragged her along the ground
till she died. And in this way she was paid back for what she had done
to them.
