112\. T<span class="small">HE</span> C<span
class="small">OUSINS</span>.—This tale is somewhat similar to [No.
15](tte2-015), but in the present version the revenge is <span
id="page_454">p. 454</span> brought on by an angakok, who assisted the
cousins on a flight, and while staying with them invoked his tornak, the
*toolik*, who carried a red-hot weapon, and destroyed the house and all
its inhabitants by fire, while the angakok flew homewards. After his
return to his house, while narrating the deed to his people, a laughing
voice was heard from without, recognised as that of his *erkungasok*
(the ingenious and cunning adviser, but rather powerless and boasting
dweller among the tornaks), who came to give notice of his having also
assisted at the destruction of his enemies.
