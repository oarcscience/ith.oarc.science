### PAPIK, WHO KILLED HIS WIFE'S BROTHER

THERE was once a man whose name was Papik, and it was his custom to go
out hunting with his wife's brother, whose name was Ailaq. But whenever
those two went out hunting together, it was always Ailaq who came home
with seal in tow, while Papik returned empty-handed. And day by day his
envy grew.

 Then one day it happened that Ailaq did not return at all. And Papik
was silent at his home-coming.

 At last, late in the evening, that old woman who was Ailaq's mother
began to speak.

 "You have killed Ailaq."

 "No, I did not kill him," answered Papik.

 Then the old woman rose up and cried:

 "You killed him, and said no word. The day shall yet come when I will
eat you alive, for you killed Ailaq, you and no other."

 And now the old woman made ready to die. for it was as a ghost she
thought to avenge her son. She took her bearskin coverlet over her, and
went and sat down on the shore, close to the water, and let the tide
come up and cover her.

 For a long time after this, Papik did not go out hunting at all, so
greatly did he fear the old woman's threat. But at last he ceased to
think of the matter, and began to go out hunting as before.

 One day two men stood out on the ice by the breathing holes. Papik had
chosen his place a little farther off, and stood there alone. And then
it came. They heard the snow creaking, with the sound of a cry, and the
sound moved towards Papik, and a fog came down over the ice. And soon
they heard shouts as of one in a fury, and the screaming of one in fear;
the monster had fallen upon Papik, to devour him.

 And now they fled in towards land, swerving wide to keep away from what
was happening there. On their way, they met sledges with hunters setting
out; they threw down their gear, and urged the others to return to their
own place at once, lest they also should be slain by fear.

 When they reached their village, all gathered together in one house.
But soon they heard the monster coming nearer over the ice, and then all
hurried to the entrance, and crowding together, grew yet more greatly
stricken with fear. And pressing thus against each other, they struggled
so hard that one fatherless boy was thrust aside and fell into a tub
full of blood. When he got up, the blood poured from his clothes, and
wherever they went, the snow was marked with blood.

 "Now we are already made food for that monster," they cried, "since
that wretched boy marks out the way with a trail of blood."

 "Let us kill him, then," said one. But the others took pity on him, and
let him live.

 And now the evil spirit came in sight out on the ice; they could see
the tips of its ears over the hummocks as it crept along. When it came
up to the houses, not a dog barked, and none dared try to surround it,
for it was not a real bear. But at last an old woman began crying to the
dogs:

 "See, there is your cousin—bark at him!" And now the dogs were loosed
from the magic that bound them, and when the men saw this, they too
dashed forward, and harpooned that thing.

 But when they came to cut up the bear, they knew its skin for the old
woman's coverlet, and its bones were human bones.

 And now the sledges drove out to find the gear they had left behind,
and they saw that everything was torn to pieces. And when they found
Papik, he was cut about in every part. Eyes, nose and mouth and ears
were hacked away, and the scalp torn from his head.

 Thus that old woman took vengeance for the killing of her son Ailaq.

 And so it was our fathers used to tell: when any man killed his <span
id="page_106">p. 106</span> fellow without good cause, a monster would
come and strike him dead with fear, and leave no part whole in all his
body.

 The people of old times thought it an ill thing for men to kill each
other.

 This story I heard from the men who came to us from the far side of the
great sea.
