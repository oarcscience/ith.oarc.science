### ÍMARASUGSSUAQ, WHO ATE HIS WIVES

IT is said that the great Ímarasugssuaq was wont to eat his wives. He
fattened them up, giving them nothing but salmon to eat, and nothing at
all to drink. Once when he had just lost his wife in the usual way, he
took to wife the sister of many brothers, and her name was Misána. And
after having taken her to wife, he began fattening her up as usual.

 One day her husband was out in his kayak. And she had grown so fat that
she could hardly move, but now she managed with difficulty to tumble
down from the bench to the floor, crawled to the entrance, dropped down
into the passage way, and began licking the snow which had drifted in.
She licked and licked at it, and at last she began to feel herself
lighter, and better able to move. And in this way she afterwards went
out and licked up snow whenever her husband was out in his kayak, and at
last she was once more quite able to move about.

 One day when her husband was out in his kayak as usual, she took her
breeches and tunic, and stuffed them out until the thing looked like a
real human being, and then she said to them:

 "When my husband comes and tells you to come out, answer him with these
words: I cannot move because I am grown so fat. And when he then comes
in and harpoons you, remember then to shriek as if in pain."

 And after she had said these words, she began digging a hole at the
back of the house, and when it was big enough, she crept in.

 "Bring up the birds I have caught!"

 But the dummy answered:

 "I can no longer move, for I am grown so fat."

 Now the dummy was sitting behind the lamp. And the husband coming in,
harpooned that dummy wife with his great bird-spear. And the thing
shrieked as if with pain and fell down. But when he looked <span
id="page_45">p. 45</span> closer, there was no blood to be seen, nothing
but some stuffed-out clothes. And where was his wife?

 And now he began to search for her, and as soon as he had gone out, she
crept forth from her hiding-place, and took to flight. And while she was
thus making her escape, her husband came after her, and seeing that he
came nearer and nearer, at last she said:

 "Now I remember, my amulet is a piece of wood."

 And hardly had she said these words, when she was changed into a piece
of wood, and her husband could not find her. He looked about as hard as
ever he could, but could see nothing beyond a piece of wood anywhere.
And he stabbed at that once or twice with his knife, but she felt no
more than a little stinging pain. Then he went back home to fetch his
axe, and then, as soon as he was out of sight, she changed back into a
woman again and fled away to her brothers.

 When she came to their house, she hid herself behind the skin hangings,
and after she had placed herself there, her husband was heard
approaching, weeping because he had lost his wife. He stayed there with
them, and in the evening, the brothers began singing songs in mockery of
him, and turning towards him also, they said:

 "Men say that Ímarasugssuaq eats his wives."

 "Who has said that?"

 "Misána has said that."

 "I said it, and I ran away because you tried to kill me," said she from
behind the hangings.

 And then the many brothers fell upon Ímarasugssuaq and held him fast
that his wife might kill him; she took her knife, but each time she
tried to strike, the knife only grazed his skin, for her fingers lost
their power.

 And she was still standing there trying in vain to stab him, when they
saw that he was already dead.

 Here ends this story.
