### (THE RITUAL OF THE ANGELS) <span id="fr_386"></span>[2](#fn_384.md)

Dominus vobiscum ended the words of their song when there was neither
heaven nor earth. When the world was submerged, when there was neither
heaven nor earth, the three-cornered precious stone <span
id="fr_387"></span>[3](#fn_385.md)of grace was born, after the divinity of
the ruler was created, <span id="fr_388"></span>[4](#fn_386.md) when there
was no heaven. Then there were born seven tuns, seven katuns, hanging in
the heart of the wind, <span id="fr_389"></span>[5](#fn_387.md) the seven
chosen ones. Then, they say, their seven graces <span
id="fr_390"></span>[6](#fn_388.md) stirred also. Seven also were their holy
images. <span id="fr_391"></span>[7](#fn_389.md) While they were still
untarnished, occurred the birth of the first precious stone of grace,
the first infinite <span id="fr_392"></span>[8](#fn_390.md) grace, when
there was infinite night, when there was no God. Not yet had he received
his Godhead. <span id="fr_393"></span>[9](#fn_391.md) Then he remained
alone within the grace, within the night, when there was neither heaven
nor earth. Then he departed <span id="fr_394"></span>[10](#fn_392.md) at
the end of the katun, as he could not be born in the first katun. There
were his long locks of hair, *adeu ti paramii*; <span
id="fr_395"></span>[11](#fn_393.md) his divinity came to him when he
departed.

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

Thereupon he became man in the second infinite precious stone of grace.
Then there arrived in the second katun Alpilcon, as the angel was named
when he was born. The second grace was permitted to depart in the second
infinite night, when no one was present. Then he received his divinity,
alone and through his own effort, when he came to depart. "*O firmar*"
he said, when he received his divinity by /

himself and through his own effort.

Thereupon he departed and went to the third infinite precious stone of
grace. Alba Congel was the name of its angel. This was the third grace.

Let me proceed to the fourth infinite precious stone of grace, to the
fourth night. Atea Ohe was the name of its angel. The fourth grace was
born and began to speak, alone and through his own effort. "Oh god, the
ruler! I am after all nothing in myself." These were his words in his
concealment, in his divinity within the grace. "Let me still proceed,"
he said.

Then he went to the fifth infinite precious stone of grace, to the fifth
infinite night. The fifth grace was born <span
id="fr_396"></span>[1](#fn_394.md) in the fifth katun. Thereupon he was set
up to declare his divinity. Then his angel was born; Decipto was the
name of his angel when he was set up. "Since it is so, let me go. Who
might I be? I am a god, a ruler, after all," and he declared his
divinity all alone. "*A ninite dei sin*," he said when he received his
divinity all by himself.

Then he went to the sixth infinite precious stone of grace, to the sixth
measured night, to the sixth katun: "Ye gods, ye rulers! Make answer to
my words. After all, I am nothing in myself alone."

The seventh grace was born. Conlamil was the name of his angel. "I
deliver the things of god to you who are gods. <span
id="fr_397"></span>[2](#fn_395.md) Answer my words. After all, there is no
one; no one replies to my words." Thus he spoke as he caused the seventh
grace to be born. And there was joy in his heart at the birth of the
seventh katun, the seven lights, the seventh measured night &lt;and&gt;
the seven infinite &lt;things&gt;.

Abiento bocayento de la zipil na <span id="fr_398"></span>[3](#fn_396.md)
*de fente note*. *Sustina gracia, trece mili, uno cargo bende*. The
first, the second, the thirteenth unfolding; thirteen banners of the
katuns; three, seven, eight thousand. Then God the Father awoke to

in person;/ in the three-cornered precious stone of grace he awoke to
consciousness, God the Father, as his name was known

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

to be. *Unidad* and God the Father, these were his names, cleft from the
katun for you. There were three generations suddenly augmented in
stature when he came. Seven were the generations of his angels. <span
id="fr_399"></span>[1](#fn_397.md) Four times did he first speak. There was
one seal <span id="fr_400"></span>[2](#fn_398.md) in the darkness, one seal
on high. "I am the beginning and I shall be the end." Here are his words
in their mighty entirety. "*Datate* here to that which has been
received. I am *Unidate*, *I am also Unitata*, I am the Dove, I am
*Unitata Anuni*. *Unidad* cometh." <span id="fr_401"></span>[3](#fn_399.md)

Nilu <span id="fr_402"></span>[4](#fn_400.md) was the name of the night.
This was the first speech of God; this was the first speech of the
Father. Of cleansed stone was his precious stone <span
id="fr_403"></span>[5](#fn_401.md) alone in the night. *Etomas*, Çipancas
was the name of the wind. Hun Katun was his father. *Otahocanil
Aucangel* was the name of the wind. <span
id="fr_404"></span>[6](#fn_402.md) H&lt;i&gt;eron was the name of the Wind.
Xicluto-tu-tanil was the name of the wind. Virtutus was the name of the
wind. Joramis was the name of the wind in the second katun. This was
what he said when he changed the stone: "*Jaxyonlacalpa*." He covered
the name of the holy heaven which our holy Lord, the Father raised up.
Bolay <span id="fr_405"></span>[7](#fn_403.md) was the name of the serpent
of the second heaven. He was in the dust at the feet of *Sustinal
Gracia*, <span id="fr_406"></span>[8](#fn_404.md) as he was called. Then
Lonmias <span id="fr_407"></span>[9](#fn_405.md) was formed. The sharp
stone was his stone within the night. Zihontun <span
id="fr_408"></span>[10](#fn_406.md) was his stone, when these stones were
fixed in their places. Three times they were set at the foot of
*Sustinal Gracia*. These stones were born, they were beneath the one
stone, the mighty pointed stone, <span id="fr_409"></span>[11](#fn_407.md)
the stone column, the mighty pointed clashing stone. They were
manifested all over the world &lt;by&gt; God the Father, /

the first ruler. In the first katun was born the only son of God; in the
second katun, the Father. In the third katun was *Expleo-ucaan*, <span
id="fr_410"></span>[12](#fn_408.md) as he was called, who chastised him
named *Chac Opilla* when he set up the heavens. *Enpileo-u-caan* <span
id="fr_411"></span>[13](#fn_409.md) was his name. *Expleo* was his name
within the

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

first noose of God. Hebones was the only son of God. &lt;Like&gt;a
mirror <span id="fr_412"></span>[1](#fn_410.md) he was borne astride on the
shoulder of his father, on the stone of his father.

Then, it is said, the boldness <span id="fr_413"></span>[2](#fn_411.md) of
the heaven on high was created. This was one grace, one stone; then fire
was created, Tixitate was his name, the light of the heavens. Sustinal,
they say, was the light from that which lighted the heaven. Acpa, it
was, who made the katun after the light originated in the heavens.
Alpa-u-manga was his name after it ended.

&lt;These are&gt; the angels <span id="fr_414"></span>[3](#fn_412.md) of
the winds which were set up while he created the star, when the world
was not yet lighted, when there was neither heaven nor earth: the Red
Pauahtun, the White Pauahtun, the Black Pauahtun, the Yellow
Pauahtun. <span id="fr_415"></span>[4](#fn_413.md)

Here was the first heaven where God the Father was set up, grasping in
his hand his stone, grasping his *cangel*, grasping his wheel <span
id="fr_416"></span>[5](#fn_414.md) on which are hung the four angels of the
winds. Cerpinus was the name of him who, under Orele, measured <span
id="fr_417"></span>[6](#fn_415.md) the land. They were three persons, God
the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. He set up the planets,
Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, which he said were held in the grasp of
the god in heaven when he created them. This was the name of the heaven,
cristalino. <span id="fr_418"></span>[7](#fn_416.md) Here were the Angels.
Corpinus was the name of him /

|          |

| p\. 52 C |

who held aloft on the palm of his hand the Blessed Father <span
id="fr_419"></span>[8](#fn_417.md) when there was neither heaven nor earth.
Inpicco

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

was his name when all the angels were asperged. <span
id="fr_420"></span>[1](#fn_418.md) Baloyo was his name when &lt;the
water&gt; was sprinkled. <span id="fr_421"></span>[2](#fn_419.md) Seros was
his name, *Et sepeuas. Laus Deo*.

Below were Chac Bolay Balam <span id="fr_422"></span>[3](#fn_420.md) and
the cacao called *balamté*. <span id="fr_423"></span>[4](#fn_421.md)
Esperas was the name of the sixth heaven; Isperas was the name of the
seventh heaven. Then the world was created by God the ruler in the
seventh katun, created in the darkness named Espiritu. St. Edendeus
&lt;and&gt; St. Eluceo were the saints who witnessed the birth of him
who was hidden within the stone, <span id="fr_424"></span>[5](#fn_422.md)
hidden within the night. *Se repite elitun entri de noche*. These were
the words said by him who was hidden within the stone, hidden within the
night: *Tronas Aleseyo de mundo de gracia. En apedia tejo çipi dia te en
pieted gracia. Santo Esuleptun jam estum est gracia. Suplilis el timeo
me firme abin finitis gracia, y metis absolutum ti metis de gracia.
Abegintis gracia, Edendeo gracia, de fentis de gracia, fenoplis tun
gracia. Locom dar yme gracia, tretris u mis gracia. Noçi luçi de gracia,
in pricio de gracia, trese mili uno de cargo, leonte*." <span
id="fr_425"></span>[6](#fn_423.md)

One, two, thirteen, one division, thirteen *bakam* of katuns. Three,
seven, eight thousand was the creation of the world, when he who was
hidden within the stone, hidden within the night, was born, when there
was neither heaven nor earth. Then God the Father /

|          |
|----------|
| p\. 53 C |

spoke alone, by his own efforts, in the darkness that clung like a
thrice withered fruit &lt;to the tree&gt;. This was the first word of
God, when there was neither heaven nor earth, when he came out of the
stone and fell into the second stone. Then it was that he declared his
divinity. Then resounded eight thousand katuns at the word of the first
stone of grace, the first ornamented <span
id="fr_426"></span>[7](#fn_424.md) stone of grace. It was the macaw that
warmed it well behind the *acantun*. <span
id="fr_427"></span>[8](#fn_425.md)

Who was born when our father descended?

Thou knowest. There was born the first macaw who cast the stones behind
the *acantun*. <span id="fr_428"></span>[9](#fn_426.md)

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

How was the grain of maize born? How, indeed, father?

Thou knowest. The tender green &lt;shoot&gt; was born in heaven.

"*Ciripacte, horca mundo. Ni mompan est noche. Amanena, omonena, apa
opa*," &lt;was said&gt; when the wind emerged from the great stone of
grace. "*Cipiones ted coruna, pater profecido*," were his words when he
arrived at the seventh stratum of the solid rock of grace. <span
id="fr_429"></span>[1](#fn_427.md) "*Bal te piones, orteçipio, reçi quenta
noche. Hun ebrietate, hun cute profeciado*," were the words of the
Angel, Jerupiter. Then the sky was put in its place, *Corporales ti
ojales*, by the first pope, the face of the katun, the burden of the
Katun 13 Ahau. The face of the sun shall be turned from its course, it
shall be turned face down during the reign of the perishable men, the
perishable rulers. Five days the sun is eclipsed, and then shall be seen
the torch of &lt;Katun&gt; 13 Ahau, a sign

given by God that death shall come to the rulers/of this land. Thus it
shall come about that the first rulers are driven from their towns. Then
Christianity &lt;shall&gt; have come here to the land.

Thus it is that God, our Father, gives a sign when they shall come,
because there is no agreement. The descendants &lt;of the former
rulers&gt; are dishonored and brought to misery; we are christianized,
while they treat us like animals. There is sorrow in the heart of God
because of these "suckers." <span id="fr_430"></span>[2](#fn_428.md)

The misspelled Latin and Spanish names may have been taken from some
Spanish treatise on astrology or magic. The decoration here is evidently
borrowed from some Spanish religious book.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_384"></span>[107:2](cbc16.htm#fr_386.md) The following ritual
is an example of the manner in which the Maya superimposed Christian
doctrines on their own religious conceptions. An account of what we
might call the Americanization of Christianity will be found in Appendix
G.

<span id="fn_385"></span>[107:3](cbc16.htm#fr_387.md) Maya *tun*. This
usually means a precious stone, while an ordinary stone or rock is
called tunich. *Tun* also means the pit of a fruit as well as the soft
surface limestone of the country. In compound words designating things
made of stone we find the same term employed; furthermore *tun* is the
name of the Maya time-period of 365 days. It is important to the
interpretation of this chapter to note that among the Maya the Spanish
word *gracia*, here literally translated as "grace," is a ritualistic
term employed to designate the young maize plant (information supplied
by Dr. Redfield). Consequently the "three-cornered precious stone of
grace" is doubtless also a liturgical term indicating a grain of corn.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[107:4](cbc16.htm#fr_388.md) Alternative
translation: was declared.

<span id="fn_387"></span>[107:5](cbc16.htm#fr_389.md) Alternative
translation: in the heart of the spirit. *Ik* may mean either wind,
breath or spirit.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[107:6](cbc16.htm#fr_390.md) Written *grasiail* in
the text.

<span id="fn_389"></span>[107:7](cbc16.htm#fr_391.md) Written *santoil* in
the text.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[107:8](cbc16.htm#fr_392.md) Maya *picib*, here
translated as though it were *picil* which means innumerable.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[107:9](cbc16.htm#fr_393.md) Written *Diosil* in
the text.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[107:10](cbc16.htm#fr_394.md) Here *buki* is
translated as though it were *luki*, he departed. *Buki* means to be
beaten up, like wax, or as soil is pulverized for cultivation.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[107:11](cbc16.htm#fr_395.md) Either for the
purpose of mystification or to add solemnity to the ritual, this chapter
is filled with Spanish and Latin words and names heard in the Christian
church service. Here the "long locks of hair" are probably a reference
to the corn-silk.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[108:1](cbc16.htm#fr_396.md) It is possible that
this word *zihil* should be translated as "originated" here, as we can
not be sure that the "grace" or maize plant, is personified. The Spanish
words for grace and angel often have a Maya suffix. The names of the
angels are unfamiliar to the translator, but they are certainly not
Maya.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[108:2](cbc16.htm#fr_397.md) The Maya text: "*Ten
kul u ba ku tex ku exe*," is translated as though it read: *Ten kub u
bal ku tex ku exe*.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[108:3](cbc16.htm#fr_398.md) In all this
abracadabra only the words, *zipil na*, appear to be Maya and might
possibly be translated as "house of sin." The reader is reminded that
the sounds of d, f, g and r do not occur in the Maya language.
Consequently the remainder appears to be a mixture of corrupted Latin
and Spanish, and, it is to be suspected, meant little more to the Maya
writer than "eena meena mina mo" does to the American child who recites
the formula.

<span id="fn_397"></span>[109:1](cbc16.htm#fr_399.md) Maya *cangel*, or
*canhel*, the genuine Maya "angel," who was probably a wind-spirit.
*Cf.* P. 67, note  [5](cbc07.htm#fn_68.md).

<span id="fn_398"></span>[109:2](cbc16.htm#fr_400.md) Maya *¢alab*, defined
as a seal or mold. Literally it means "that which is pressed down on
something." The reference is to the terra cotta stamps or molds employed
in decorating pottery, and it is possible that they were also used to
stamp certain decorations on the human body.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[109:3](cbc16.htm#fr_401.md) Of these italicized
words, *Anuni* is the only one which is not intended for Latin or
Spanish. Possibly it is either a corrupted Nahuatl form or one taken
from the Chol-Tzeltal group of languages.

<span id="fn_400"></span>[109:4](cbc16.htm#fr_402.md) Possibly a reference
to "Egyptian darkness."

<span id="fn_401"></span>[109:5](cbc16.htm#fr_403.md) From here on, the
*tun* appears to refer to a stela or monument.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[109:6](cbc16.htm#fr_404.md) Maya *ik*, here
translated as wind, also means breath, life and spirit. "*El espíritu,
vida y aliento*." Motul.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[109:7](cbc16.htm#fr_405.md) *Bolay*, the general
name for a beast of prey.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[109:8](cbc16.htm#fr_406.md) Apparently a
corruption of some form of the Latin *sustineo* and *gracia*, in which
case it would probably mean "sustaining grace," or in other words, the
maize plant which is our sustenance.

<span id="fn_405"></span>[109:9](cbc16.htm#fr_407.md) Lonmias may be a
corruption of Hieronymus.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[109:10](cbc16.htm#fr_408.md) Zihontun might be
translated as the created stone.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[109:11](cbc16.htm#fr_409.md) Alternative
translation: the red pointed stone.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[109:12](cbc16.htm#fr_410.md) This mixture of
Latin and Maya could be translated: I fill out the heavens.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[109:13](cbc16.htm#fr_411.md) Possibly the *Cielo
Empireo* is meant.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[110:1](cbc16.htm#fr_412.md) The Maya carried
mirrors, possibly on the back or shoulder.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[110:2](cbc16.htm#fr_413.md) Alternative
translation: the bold one, the mad one, the turbulent one; possibly this
is a confused recollection of the story of Lucifer. A Maya legend much
resembling the Lucifer story is reported from Yucatan (Relaciones de
Yucatan, I, p. 177).

<span id="fn_412"></span>[110:3](cbc16.htm#fr_414.md) Maya, *cangeles ik*.
The reference is evidently to the so-called "angels," one of whom was
set on the back of the image of the Red Bacab in the ceremony pertaining
to the year ascribed to the east. This "angel" was a sign of good rains
and favorable crops. Easterly winds have always been favorably regarded
by the Maya, and the translator believes that this cangel (Landa's
"angel" and Beltran's "dragon") was a wind-spirit. It probably looked
more like a dragon than an angel. As we see here, there were four of
them, and the word itself could well be translated as "the four changing
ones." Consequently our "angels of the wind" would be originally the
"four changing winds." *Cf.* p. 67, note  [5](cbc07.htm#fn_68.md).

<span id="fn_413"></span>[110:4](cbc16.htm#fr_415.md) This passage confirms
Baeza's account of the *misa milpera* (quoted in Brinton 1890, p. 166),
in which it is stated that the four Pauahtuns are identical with the
winds and the four cardinal points from which they blow. A discussion of
the four cardinal points and the deities associated with them will be
found in Appendix A.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[110:5](cbc16.htm#fr_416.md) Maya, *kabalil*, is
the primitive Yucatecan potter's wheel, which is only a block of wood on
which the pot is turned by the feet of the potter. See Tozzer 1907,
Plate 13, fig. 3. In the Codex Cortesianus (pp. 20-21 d), we see a
wheel-like ceremonial object held by four bird-headed figures. The
pictures illustrate a *tzol-kin* (or tonalamatl) divided into four parts
and beginning with the day 4 Ik (4 Wind).

<span id="fn_415"></span>[110:6](cbc16.htm#fr_417.md) We find several
unexplained references to "measuring the land." *Cf.* [p.
65](cbc06.htm#page_65.md).

<span id="fn_416"></span>[110:7](cbc16.htm#fr_418.md) We find in the Books
of Chilam Balam of Ixil and Kaua a diagram on which the earth is
enclosed within eleven spheres labeled Luna, Mercurio, Venus, Sol,
Marte, Jupiter, Saturno, Firmamento (containing the fixed stars),
Christalino, Primer Mobil and Cielo Empireo. It is, of course, the
popular idea of Ptolmaic astronomy in vogue at the time, and was not
unlike the native conception of thirteen heavens, of which the earth
itself counted as the first.

<span id="fn_417"></span>[110:8](cbc16.htm#fr_419.md) Possible alternative
translation: The blessing of the Father, etc.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[111:1](cbc16.htm#fr_420.md) Sprinkling with a
consecrated liquid was an ancient Maya ceremony. Landa 1928, p. 184.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[111:2](cbc16.htm#fr_421.md) Alternative
translation: when they (the angels) were scattered.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[111:3](cbc16.htm#fr_422.md) *Balam* is a general
term for jaguar, but it can also mean priest. *Chac-bolay* is *Felis
hernandesii goldmani* Mearns; but it was also the name of a certain evil
spirit, and spreading the skin of this jaguar in the market-place was a
symbol of war, famine and pestilence (Tizimin, p. 30).

<span id="fn_421"></span>[111:4](cbc16.htm#fr_423.md) Balamté is the
*Theobroma bicolor* Humb. & Bonpl.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[111:5](cbc16.htm#fr_424.md) Maya, *u lamay tun*,
probably the planted seed corn. The definition of this phrase, "the
square stone," symbolizing the twenty years of the katun, has long been
accepted. The word for squared, however, is *amay*, not *lamay*, which
means sunk out of sight, hidden. *Cf.* Chumayel, p. 163, where we read
of the "hell which is sunken within the world."

<span id="fn_423"></span>[111:6](cbc16.htm#fr_425.md) Little, if any, of
this hocus-pocus is Maya, and it is the conjecture of the translator
that its source was some itinerant Spanish fortune-teller or astrologer.
*Cf.* Aguilar 1900, p. 80. The repetition of the word *gracia* suggests
an incantation to make the corn grow.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[111:7](cbc16.htm#fr_426.md) Literally,
embroidered. Maya: *hun piliz tun de gracia*.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[111:8](cbc16.htm#fr_427.md) This reference
recalls the legend of the divine macaw which brought down from heaven
the fire to consume the sacrifice to Kinich Kakmó, the sun-god, at
Izamal (Cogolludo 1868, 1, p. 319). For an account of the *acantun*, see
page 114, note  [3](cbc17.htm#fn_434.md).

<span id="fn_426"></span>[111:9](cbc16.htm#fr_428.md) The text is confused
here and the translation a little uncertain.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[112:1](cbc16.htm#fr_429.md) Probably a fanciful
conception of the structure of the maize-kernel.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[112:2](cbc16.htm#fr_430.md) Possibly this is a
reference to the name first given to the Spaniards. They were called
"suckers of anonas," because they were seen eating the pond-apple, an
insipid fruit not considered edible by the natives.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[112:3](cbc16.htm#fr_431.md) Here as elsewhere Don
Juan de Montejo is confused with his father, Don Francisco, the Spanish
conqueror. The door of the old Montejo mansion in Merida faces north,
not east, and it is the belief of the translator that this reference is
not to the actual house of Montejo, but to the compartment, or so-called
"house," of the katun-wheel in which is pictured Katun 11 Ahau, the
first katun of the Spanish Conquest in which Montejo ruled the country.
The katun-wheel on page 132 of the Chumayel ascribes Katun 11 Ahau to
the east.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[112:4](cbc16.htm#fr_432.md) Written in a
different hand.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[112:5](cbc16.htm#fr_433.md) Written in a
different hand.
