<P>Katun 11 Ahau is set upon the mat, set upon the throne, when their ruler is set up. Yaxal Chac&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> is its face to their ruler. The heavenly fan, the heavenly wreath and the heavenly bouquet shall descend.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_163"></A><A HREF="#fn_162"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> The drum and rattle of the lord of 11 Ahau shall resound, when flint knives are set into his mantle.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> At that time there shall be the green turkey; at that time there shall be Zulim Chan; at that time there shall be Chakanputun.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> They shall find their food among the trees; they shall find their food among the rocks, those who have lost their &lt;usual&gt; food&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> in katun 11 Ahau.</P>

Still he who comes of our lineage will know it, one of us who are Maya men. He will know how to explain these things when he reads what is here. When he sees it, then he will explain the adjustment of the intricacy of the katun by our priest, Ah Kin Xuluc; but Xuluc&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> was not his name formerly.

<P><A NAME="fn_161"></A><A HREF="cbc08.htm#fr_162">77:4</A> Literally, the green rain-god. Rain is green in the Maya picture-manuscripts. <I>Cf.</I> Appendix A.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_162"></A><A HREF="cbc08.htm#fr_163">77:5</A> In the Mani version of this prophecy these objects are said to be held in the hand of Yaxal Chac (Perez Codex, p. 75). We are told that the Maya "were fond of fragrant odors, and so made use of bouquets of flowers and fragrant herbs of odd designs." The bouquet was also a ceremonial object, for when children were baptised, the priest's assistant carried a bouquet of flowers. With this he made a threatening motion nine times at each child and then caused the child to smell it (Landa 1928, pp. 150 and 184).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_167"></A><A HREF="cbc08.htm#fr_168">78:2</A> This is the end of the prophecy. What follows is a commentary.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_169"></A><A HREF="cbc08.htm#fr_170">78:4</A> Xuluc is probably derived from the name of a fish resembling the dace, but it can also mean perishable, hence the play on words here.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_170"></A><A HREF="cbc08.htm#fr_171">79:1</A> <I>Limosna</I> in the text, but to the Indians it meant compulsory dues.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_172"></A><A HREF="cbc08.htm#fr_173">79:3</A> These are stereotyped phrases usually employed to describe a riot or the plundering of a town.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_173"></A><A HREF="cbc08.htm#fr_174">79:4</A> Here we have a description of the oppression of the Indians during the colonial period, not only by the Spaniards but also by many of their own chiefs who held public office under the Spanish regime.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_174"></A><A HREF="cbc08.htm#fr_175">79:5</A> Maya, <I>camzah</I>, is a term also supplied to the village choirmaster, a person of considerable authority.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_175"></A><A HREF="cbc08.htm#fr_176">79:6</A> Called <I>antachristoil</I> in the text. We suspect it merely means bad Christians here.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_176"></A><A HREF="cbc08.htm#fr_177">79:7</A> These are terms applied in general to harsh and oppressive Maya chiefs. It is probable that they were originally honorable titles among the Itz&aacute;. <I>Cf.</I> Appendix F.</P>
