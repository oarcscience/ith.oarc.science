# APPENDIX B

### THE SACRIFICIAL CENOTE AT CHICHEN ITZA

Chichen Itzá was at one time not only the greatest and most powerful
city in Yucatan, but it was a sacred city as well, a center of
pilgrimage to which people flocked from every part of the peninsula and
from foreign countries also to make offerings of gold, incense, copper,
precious stones and human victims. The city owed its reputation for
sanctity to its cenote, <span id="fr_951"></span>[1](#fn_944.md) or natural
well, which was believed to be inhabited by the gods and the spirits of
the illustrious dead. It is a great cup-shaped depression in the earth
with perpendicular walls, about seventy feet down to the surface of the
water and about one hundred and seventy feet across. The sacred well
served no utilitarian purpose; the city obtained its water from another
more convenient cenote and several artificial wells.

We first hear of the Sacrificial Cenote from Bishop Landa who mentions
it several times in his report on the natives of Yucatan. He gives an
account of human sacrifice and adds: "Besides killing people in their
towns, they had two infamous sanctuaries at Chichen Itzá and Cozumel,
where they sent an infinite number of wretched people to be sacrificed.
At the former they were flung headlong down a precipice, and at the
latter they tore out their hearts." <span
id="fr_952"></span>[2](#fn_945.md) "From the court facing these theaters
(two stone platforms in front of the main temple) a broad and handsome
causeway led to a well about twice a stone's throw distant. Into this
well it was their custom to cast living men as a sacrifice to the Gods
in times of drought; and it was their belief that they did not die,
although they never saw them any more. They also threw in many other
things of precious stone and articles which they highly prized. Thus if
this land had contained gold, this well would hold the largest part of
it, so devoted were the Indians to it. It is a well with a depth of
seven times a man's height down to the water and a breadth of more than
one hundred feet. It is round with a sheer precipice down to the water
which is extraordinary. The water appears to be very green, and I
believe that this is caused by the thicket of trees with which it is
surrounded. It is also very deep. Above, close to its mouth, is a small
structure where I found idols made in honor of all the principal
edifices of the country, almost like the Pantheon at Rome. I do not know
whether this was a device of the ancients or of the moderns in order to
encounter their idols when they came to this well with offerings. I
found pumas carved in the round, (stone) jars and other things such that
I do

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

not know how anyone can say that these people did not have steel
tools. <span id="fr_953"></span>[1](#fn_946.md) I also found two men of
great stature each carved from a single block of stone, naked but their
modesty preserved by the coverings the Indians formerly used. They had
separate heads with ear-rings in the ears such as the Indians used to
wear. There was a tenon at the back of the neck which fitted into a deep
hole made for it which was also in the neck. When fitted together it
made a complete figure." <span id="fr_954"></span>[2](#fn_947.md) Landa
also tells us "that they held Cozumel and the well at Chichen Itzá in as
great veneration as we do the pilgrimages to Jerusalem and Rome." <span
id="fr_955"></span>[3](#fn_948.md)

A report by the municipality of Valladolid written in 1579 covers a
number of details omitted by Landa. Here we read: "This pyramid (the
principal temple of the city) lies between two cenotes of very deep
water. One of these is called the Sacrificial Cenote. Chichen Itzá was
named for an Indian who lived beside the Sacrificial Cenote and who was
called Ah Kin Itzá. <span id="fr_956"></span>[4](#fn_949.md) It was the
custom of the lords and nobles of all these provinces of Valladolid to
fast for sixty days without raising their eyes during this time even to
look at their wives or those who brought them their food. And this they
did in order, when they should arrive at the mouth of that cenote, to
cast into it at break of day some Indian women of each of these lords.
They had told them that they should ask for an abundant year &lt;and&gt;
all those things which occurred to them. Thus when these Indian women
were thrown in without being bound but flung down as from a cliff, they
fell into the water striking it with great force. Precisely at mid-day
the one who was to come forth made a great outcry for them to let down a
rope to draw her out. When she came up half dead, they built large fires
about her perfuming her with copal incense. After she recovered
consciousness, she said that down below there were many of her nation,
both men and women, and that they received her; but when she raised her
head to look at any of them, they struck her with heavy blows on the
back of the neck so that she should keep her head bowed. This was all
within the water, below which there were believed to be many hollows and
pits. And they replied to her whether there would be an abundant year or
a bad one according to the questions which the Indian woman asked of
them. And if the devil was angered with any of the lords who threw in
the Indian women, when none asked to be drawn out at precisely noon,
they knew that he was angry with them and that she would never more come
forth. In this it rather resembles

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

what occurred at the cave of Salamanca. <span
id="fr_957"></span>[1](#fn_950.md) Then when it was seen that she was not
coming out, that lord and all of his &lt;men&gt; threw great stones into
the water and fled precipitately from the place making a great
outcry." <span id="fr_958"></span>[2](#fn_951.md)

We have seen in the Chumayel, <span id="fr_959"></span>[3](#fn_952.md)
however, that one man at least did not flee in terror from the cenote
when none of the messengers to the gods returned. This was Hunac Ceel,
later the head-chief of Mayapan who conquered Chichen Itzá and drove out
its inhabitants. <span id="fr_960"></span>[4](#fn_953.md) He was evidently
of the stuff of which rulers are made, a man with sufficient courage and
force of character to shape his own destiny. When no one appeared on the
surface of the water crying to be drawn out, he realized that the
prophecy must be obtained at any cost. "It was Cauich, Hunac Ceel,
Cauich, was the name of the man there who put out his head over the
mouth of the well on the south side. Then he went to get it. Then he
came forth to declare the prophecy." There can be but one interpretation
of this terse statement: Hunac Ceel cast himself into the cenote and
returned from its depths bringing the desired prophecy.

In his account of the visit of Father Alonso Ponce to Yucatan in the
summer of 1588, Antonio de Ciudad Real, the reputed author of the Motul
Dictionary, tells of the Sacrificial Cenote at Chichen Itzá and adds the
detail that "they even say that in the wall of this well or *zonote*
there is a cave which enters a considerable distance within &lt;the
cliff&gt;." <span id="fr_961"></span>[5](#fn_954.md) In his description of
the ruins of Mayapan the same writer describes the principal pyramid and
states: "Near the foot of this *mul* (pyramid) there is a very deep
*zonote* with a very flat stone at the edge of its mouth from which (as
they say) they flung down those whom they sacrificed to their
gods." <span id="fr_962"></span>[6](#fn_955.md) Stephens found a cenote at
Mayapan near the base of one of the larger pyramids there but states
that it was in a cave. "The entrance was by a broken, yawning mouth,
steep, and requiring some care in the descent." <span
id="fr_963"></span>[7](#fn_956.md)

Long after Chichen Itzá ceased to be of political importance, its sacred
cenote continued to draw pilgrims. The last pilgrimage of which we have
any knowledge was in 1536, and although its members never reached the
holy spot, the event had considerable influence on the history of the
country. "The Spaniards having gone forth from Yucatan (1535), there was
a scarcity of water in the land, and as they had used their maize
recklessly in the wars with the Spaniards, there came upon them a great
hunger, so great that they were

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

even brought to eat the bark of trees, especially one which they called
*cumche*, <span id="fr_964"></span>[1](#fn_957.md) which is soft and tender
inside. On account of this famine the Xiu who are Lords of Mani resolved
to make a solemn sacrifice to the idols, bearing certain slaves, both
men and maidens, to be thrown into the well of Chichen Itzá, and to
reach which they have to pass by the town of the Lords Cocomes, their
principal enemies, and so thinking that at such a time ancient passions
would not be renewed in this land, they (the Xiu) sent to them (the
Cocom) asking them to let them (the Xiu) pass through their land. And
the Cocomes deceived them with a fair reply, and giving them shelter all
together in one great house they set fire to it and slew those who
escaped, and for this reason there were great wars." <span
id="fr_965"></span>[2](#fn_958.md) Here we have the complete story of the
murder of Napot Xiu mentioned on pages [138](cbc24.htm#page_138.md),
[142](cbc26.htm#page_142) and [146](cbc27.htm#page_146.md) of the present
work. From this it would appear that the rain-god was one of the
divinities who dwelt in the Sacrificial Cenote.

In a report written in 1581 by one of the early Spanish settlers who
tells us that he received much of his information from Gaspar Antonio
Chi, we read: "At one time all this land was under the dominion of a
lord who dwelt at the ancient city of Chichen Itzá and to whom all the
lords of this province were tributaries. And even from without the
province, from Mexico, Guatemala, Chiapas and other provinces they sent
them presents in token of peace and friendship." <span
id="fr_966"></span>[3](#fn_959.md) We can not but believe that these
foreign embassies, which must have traveled for weeks through tropical
forests, swamps and waterless wastes to reach a far-off city in
northeastern Yucatan, were motivated more by the religious veneration
which its famous sanctuary enjoyed than by the political prestige which
its rulers enjoyed in such a distant country.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_944"></span>[173:1](cbc31.htm#fr_951.md) The word cenote is a
Spanish corruption of the Maya *¢onot*. As the drainage of Yucatan is
subterranean and the ponds of surface water are unfit to drink, the
water used is drawn either from cenotes or artificial wells. In Maya
c~~h~~een, which means an artificial well primarily, is also another
name for a cenote, hence the name Chichen Itzá, which means the mouth of
the well of the Itzá.

<span id="fn_946"></span>[174:1](cbc31.htm#fr_953.md) Landa employs the
term, *herramientas*, which means iron or steel tools, but he must have
meant merely hard metal tools in general. It would seem that he was too
well informed about the Indians to believe that they ever had iron or
steel.

<span id="fn_950"></span>[175:1](cbc31.htm#fr_957.md) There was a story of
an enchanted cave at Salamanca in Spain which contained an oracle. Of
seven who entered to consult the oracle only six ever returned
(Relaciones de Yucatan, II, p. 26, note 1).
