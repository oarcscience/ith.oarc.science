### (THE BUILDING OF THE MOUNDS)

In the year 1541. <span id="fr_179"></span>[9](#fn_178.md)

181 <u>¢</u>uul. at. 5 Dik: 92 nhele <span

The history which I have written of how the mounds came to be
constructed by the heathen. <span id="fr_181"></span>[11](#fn_180.md)
During three score and fifteen katuns they were constructed. <span
id="fr_182"></span>[12](#fn_181.md) The great men made them. Then the
remainder of the men went

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

to Cartabona, <span id="fr_183"></span>[1](#fn_182.md) as the land where
they were is called today. There they were when San Bernabé <span
id="fr_184"></span>[2](#fn_183.md) came to teach them. Then they were
killed by the men; the men were called heathen. 1&lt;5&gt;56 is the
total count today &lt;after&gt; fifteen years. <span
id="fr_185"></span>[3](#fn_184.md) On this day I have written how the great
mounds /

came to be built by the lineages and all the things which the rulers
did. They were the ones who built the mounds. &lt;It took&gt; thirteen
katuns and six years for them to construct them. The following was the
beginning of the mounds they built. Fifteen four-hundreds were the
scores of their mounds, and fifty &lt;more&gt; <span
id="fr_186"></span>[4](#fn_185.md) &lt;made&gt; the total count of the
mounds they constructed all over the land. From the sea to the base of
the land <span id="fr_187"></span>[5](#fn_186.md) they created names for
them as well as for the wells. Then a miracle was performed for them by
God. Then they were burned by fire among the people of Israel. &lt;This
is&gt; the record of the katuns and years since Chac-unezcab of the
lineage of the Tutul Xius departed from Viroa. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_178"></span>[79:9](cbc09.htm#fr_179.md) The year of the
Spanish settlement at Merida.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[79:10](cbc09.htm#fr_180.md) Probably a confused
imitation of the chapter-heading in some Spanish history.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[79:11](cbc09.htm#fr_181.md) Written *heregesob*
(literally heretics) in the text. *Cf.* p. 115, note
 [4](cbc17.htm#fn_446.md).

<span id="fn_181"></span>[79:12](cbc09.htm#fr_182.md) This is evidently an
attempt to fix the period of building activity in northern Yucatan, just
as on page 83 we find four baktuns and fifteen katuns given as what was
probably the period of Maya civilization. Some Maya writers put the end
of the native regime at the time of the settlement of Merida in 1541 and
others fix the date at 1519 when <span id="page_80">p. 80</span> Cortez
landed at Cosumel and even confuse the latter date with that of the
settlement at Merida (*Cf.* pp. 81, 84). Possibly we have here a
reference to the Long Count. If so the end of the native regime (whether
we place it in 1519 or 1541) was believed to be fifteen katuns after an
even number of baktuns, or scores of katuns as stated here. As to what
the three baktuns were, two alternatives seem the most probable. We
could consider them to be Baktuns 9, 10 and 11, which would make the
Spanish conquest fall in the katun following 12. 15. 0. 0. 0.  1 Ahau 13
Uo. The other most likely alternative would be to consider these three
baktuns to be Baktuns, 8, 9 and 10. This would fix the Spanish Conquest
in the katun immediately following 11. 15. 0. 0. 0.  2 Ahau 8 Zac. It is
generally agreed that Cortez landed in Cozumel during the first part of
the katun immediately following Katun 2 Ahau, while on the other hand no
dated monuments earlier than Baktun 9 have been found in northern
Yucatan. It is possible, of course, that the inhabitants of northern
Yucatan had been constructing the mounds mentioned here for some
centuries before they set up the first dated monument.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[80:1](cbc09.htm#fr_183.md) Cartabona is certainly
a European name, but it is not identified.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[80:2](cbc09.htm#fr_184.md) Possibly a reference
to the battle on the day of San Bernabé at Merida.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[80:3](cbc09.htm#fr_185.md) Although one of the
figures is omitted, the year 1556 seems to be intended, as it was
fifteen years after the occupation of Merida in 1541.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[80:4](cbc09.htm#fr_186.md) When we find round
numbers given in terms of fifty, one hundred or one thousand, we may
suspect the influence of European methods of counting on the mind of the
Maya writer.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[80:5](cbc09.htm#fr_187.md) Maya: *tu chun cab*.
Campeche was called "the base of the land." Chumayel, p. 86.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[80:6](cbc09.htm#fr_188.md) Viroa appears to be a
corruption of some Spanish or Latin word as the letter r does not occur
in Maya. The name, Chacunezcab is unfamiliar, and a possible alternative
translation would be: since the lineage of the Tutul Xius departed there
at Viroa, Chacunezcab.
