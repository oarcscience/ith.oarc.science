### (MEMORANDA CONCERNING THE HISTORY OF YUCATAN)

A record of the katuns and years when the Province of Yucatan was first
seized by the foreigners, the white men. It was, they say, in Katun 11
Ahau that they seized the port of Ecab. They came from the east when
they arrived. They say they were the first to eat the pond-apple for
breakfast, this was the reason they called them the foreigners who ate
pond-apples; foreigners who

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

sucked pond-apples, they were called. <span
id="fr_189"></span>[1](#fn_188.md) This is the name of the householder whom
they seized at Ecab, Nacom Balam <span id="fr_190"></span>[2](#fn_189.md)
was his name. He was the first to be seized at Ecab by the first
&lt;Spanish&gt; captain, Don Juan /

|          |

| p\. 17 C |

de Montejo, the first conqueror. It was still the same katun when they
arrived at Ichcanziho (Merida). <span id="fr_191"></span>[3](#fn_190.md)

It was the year 1513 in Katun 13 Ahau that they seized Campeche. They
were there one katun. <span id="fr_192"></span>[4](#fn_191.md) Ah Kin Camal
from Campeche introduced the foreigners into the province here.

It was on August 20th in the year 1541, I have made known the name of
the year when Christianity began.

In the year 1519, after seven score and eleven years, occurred the
agreement with the foreigners, <span id="fr_193"></span>[5](#fn_192.md)
according to which we paid for the war between the foreigners and the
other men here in the towns. It was the captains of the towns &lt;who
made war&gt;. It is we who pay for it today.

Today I have written down that in the year 1541 the foreigners first
arrived from the east at Ecab, as it was called. In that year occurred
their arrival at the port of Ecab, at the village of Nacom Balam, on the
first day of the year /

|          |

| p\. 18 C |

in which Katun 11 Ahau <span id="fr_194"></span>[6](#fn_193.md)
&lt;fell&gt;. After the Itzá were dispersed, it was fifteen score
years <span id="fr_195"></span>[7](#fn_194.md) when the foreigners arrived.
&lt;It was&gt; after the town of Zaclahtun <span
id="fr_196"></span>[8](#fn_195.md)was depopulated, after the town of
Kinchil Coba <span id="fr_197"></span>[9](#fn_196.md) was depopulated,

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

after the town of Chichen Itzá was depopulated, after the town on the
Uxmal side &lt;of the range of hills&gt;, the great town of Uxmal as it
is called, <span id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_197.md) was depopulated, as
well as Kabah. <span id="fr_199"></span>[2](#fn_198.md) It was after the
towns of Zeye, <span id="fr_200"></span>[3](#fn_199.md) Pakam, <span
id="fr_201"></span>[4](#fn_200.md) Homtun, at the town of
Tix-calom-kin, <span id="fr_202"></span>[5](#fn_201.md) and Ake, <span
id="fr_203"></span>[6](#fn_202.md) Holtun Ake, were depopulated.

It was after the town of Emal Chac <span id="fr_204"></span>[7](#fn_203.md)
was depopulated, Izamal, <span id="fr_205"></span>[8](#fn_204.md) where the
daughter of the true God, Lord of Heaven, descended, the Queen, the
Virgin, the miraculous One. <span id="fr_206"></span>[9](#fn_205.md) When
the ruler said: "The shield of Kinich Kakmo <span
id="fr_207"></span>[10](#fn_206.md) shall descend," he was not declared
ruler here. It was she, the miraculous one, the merciful one, who was so
declared here. "The rope shall descend, the cord shall descend from
heaven. The word shall descend from heaven." There was rejoicing over
his reign by the other towns when they said this, but he was not
declared their ruler at Emal (Izamal?). <span
id="fr_208"></span>[11](#fn_207.md)

Then the great Itzá went &lt;away&gt;. Thirteen four-hundreds were the
four-hundreds of their thousands, <span id="fr_209"></span>[12](#fn_208.md)
and fifteen four-hundreds, the four-hundreds of their hundreds, the
leading men among them, the heathen Itzá. <span
id="fr_210"></span>[13](#fn_209.md) But many supporters went with them to
feed them. Thirteen measures of

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

corn per head was their quota, and nine measures and three handsful of
grain. From many small towns the magicians went with them also. /  <span
id="fr_211"></span>[1](#fn_210.md)

|          |
|----------|
| p\. 19 C |

They did not wish to join with the foreigners; they did not desire
Christianity. They did not wish to pay tribute, did those whose emblems
were the bird, the precious stone, the flat precious stone and the
jaguar, <span id="fr_212"></span>[2](#fn_211.md) those with the three magic
&lt;emblems&gt;. Four four-hundreds of years and fifteen score years was
the end of their lives; <span id="fr_213"></span>[3](#fn_212.md) then came
the end of their lives, because they knew the measure of their days.
Complete was the month; complete, the year; complete, the day; complete,
the night; complete, the breath of life as it passed also; complete, the
blood, when they arrived at their beds, their mats, their thrones. In
due measure did they recite the good prayers; in due measure they sought
the lucky days, until they saw the good stars enter into their reign;
then they kept watch while the reign of the good stars began. Then
everything was good.

Then they adhered to &lt;the dictates of&gt; their reason. There was no
sin; in the holy faith their lives &lt;were passed&gt;. There was then
no sickness; they had then no aching bones; they had then no high fever;
they had then no smallpox; they had then no burning chest; they had then
no abdominal pains; they had then no consumption; they had then no
headache. <span id="fr_214"></span>[4](#fn_213.md) At that time the course
of humanity was orderly. The foreigners made it otherwise when they
arrived here. They brought shameful things /

|          |
|----------|
| p\. 20 C |

when they came. They lost their innocence in carnal sin; they lost their
innocence in the carnal sin of Nacxit Xuchit, <span
id="fr_215"></span>[5](#fn_214.md) in the carnal sin of his companions. No
lucky days were then displayed to us. This was the origin of the two-day
chair (or throne), of the two-day reign; <span
id="fr_216"></span>[6](#fn_215.md) this was the cause of our sickness also.
There were no more lucky days for us; we had no sound judgment. At the
end of our loss of vision, and of our shame, everything shall be
revealed. There was no great

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

teacher, no great speaker, no supreme priest, when the change of rulers
occurred at their arrival. Lewd were the priests, when they came to be
established here by the foreigners. Furthermore they left their
descendants here at Tancah (Mayapan). These then received the
misfortunes, after the affliction <span id="fr_217"></span>[1](#fn_216.md)
of these foreigners. These, they say, were the Itzá. Three times it was,
they say, that the foreigners arrived. It was because of this that we
were relieved from paying tribute at the age of sixty, <span
id="fr_218"></span>[2](#fn_217.md) because of the affliction by these men,
/

|          |
|----------|
| p\. 21 C |

the Itzá. It was not we who did it; it is we who pay for it today.
However there is at last an agreement so that there may be peace between
us and the foreigners. Otherwise there will be a great war. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_188"></span>[81:1](cbc10.htm#fr_189.md) *Op* is a general term
for the Annona species today, but it seems likely that at the time of
the Conquest, the *op* or *makop* was the insipid pond-apple, the fruit
of the *Annona glabra* L. which is of little use for food.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[81:2](cbc10.htm#fr_190.md) Cogolludo (Book 2,
Chap. 5) states that Nacom Balam was an old man living at a ranch called
Coni, near Conil, on the east coast.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[81:3](cbc10.htm#fr_191.md) Juan de Montejo was
the son of Francisco the younger. The latter arrived at Merida in Katun
11 Ahau.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[81:4](cbc10.htm#fr_192.md) Few of the dates
mentioned here are correct.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[81:5](cbc10.htm#fr_193.md) The agreement with the
Spaniards was in 1542 or 1543, and not in 1519. The year 1543 was just
seven score and eleven years after a certain year 7 Cauac which fell in
1392, and was employed as the basis of a chronological count for some
reason as yet undiscovered (Chilam Balam of Mani apud Codex Perez, p.
127).

<span id="fn_193"></span>[81:6](cbc10.htm#fr_194.md) The Spanish Conquest
of northern Yucatan was completed and Merida founded early in Katun 11
Ahau, but it was during the previous katun that Montejo first landed on
the east coast of Yucatan. The port of Ecab was near Cape Cotoche and
eight leagues northwest of Mugeres Island (Relaciones de Yucatan, II, p.
173).

<span id="fn_194"></span>[81:7](cbc10.htm#fr_195.md) According to the
chronicles, Chichen Itzá was depopulated by Hunac Ceel in a Katun 8 Ahau
which was seventeen katuns before Montejo entered Yucatan in a Katun 13
Ahau. In connection with the period of fifteen katuns mentioned here,
compare p. 79, note  [12](cbc09.htm#fn_181), p. 83, note  [3](#fn_212.md),
and Appendix H.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[81:8](cbc10.htm#fr_196.md) This appears to be the
town usually called Zaclactun. In the third Chumayel chronicle and in
all the prophecies for Katun 12 Ahau except the two in the Tizimin (see
table of references at the end of Appendix D) and the katun-wheel ([p.
132](cbc23.htm#page_132).md), we find the name given as Saclactun Mayapan;
and in the other three places it is called Zaclactun or Zaclahtun. It
seems likely therefore that Zaclactun was the ancient name of Mayapan.
In the latter name the last syllable, *-pan*, is a Nahuatl word meaning
banner. According to Brinton (1882, p. 175) Zaclactun "apparently means
'the place where white pottery is made.'" The present translator is
inclined to derive this name from *zacal actun*, white cave or,
according to the Motul dictionary, white stone building.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[81:9](cbc10.htm#fr_197.md) Here, as in most of
the prophecies for Katun 13 Ahau, Kinchil Coba is given as a place-name.
In the Books of Chilam Balam of Kaua and Mani (apud Morley 1920, <span
id="page_82">p. 82</span> p. 482) this is the name of a personage, and
Avendaño (see p. 134, note 5) tells of a statue, probably an idol, at
Tayasal named Kinchil Coba. In all likelihood the Kaua version of his
name, Ah Kinchil Coba, is the correct one, meaning "the man of Kinchil
Coba." Thompson believes that the place, Kinchil Coba, was the city of
Cobá, and the writer is inclined to agree with him (Thompson, Pollock,
Charlot 1932, p. 6). Of interest is the statement in the Calkini
Chronicle that at the town of Kinchil in northwestern Yucatan "there is
a stone building, the stone building of the man of Coba, &lt;Ah&gt;
Kinchil Coba." "*ti yan nocac u nocacil Ah Coba he Kinchil Coba*"
(Crónica de Calkini, p. 38).

<span id="fn_197"></span>[82:1](cbc10.htm#fr_198.md) The Maya text reads:
"*cib u kaba*," but has been corrected to *ci bin u kaba* and so
translated. As the text stands in the original, the translation could
be: to the south of the town of Uxmal, Cib was its name, was
depopulated.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[82:2](cbc10.htm#fr_199.md) This is the only
mention in Maya literature of the name of these ruins known to the
translator.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[82:3](cbc10.htm#fr_200.md) There is a town of
this name northeast of Acanceh, and Indians of Ticul who have farms near
the ruins of Zayi insist that Zeyé is the correct name of that site.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[82:4](cbc10.htm#fr_201.md) Possibly the town of
Tepakam northwest of Izamal is meant.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[82:5](cbc10.htm#fr_202.md) This name much
resembles that of Xcalumkin, also called Holactun, a site noted for its
Initial Series date.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[82:6](cbc10.htm#fr_203.md) Aké is a well-known
ruined city, also a Maya family name. Holtun is difficult to translate;
it might mean stone gate or opening in the rock. We read of Holtun Zuyua
(p. 74) and Holtun Itzá (p. 146), also of a personage named Holtun Balam
(pp. [74](cbc07.htm#page_74) and [147](cbc27.htm#page_147).md).

<span id="fn_203"></span>[82:7](cbc10.htm#fr_204.md) Emal Chac, literally
where the Chac (rain-god) descended.

<span id="fn_204"></span>[82:8](cbc10.htm#fr_205.md) Written "Etzemal" in
the text.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[82:9](cbc10.htm#fr_206.md) Nra. Señora de Izamal,
the famous Virgin of Izamal.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[82:10](cbc10.htm#fr_207.md) An idol at Izamal.
See p. 160, note  [2](cbc27.htm#fn_842.md).

<span id="fn_207"></span>[82:11](cbc10.htm#fr_208.md) Here the worship of
the Virgin of Izamal is ascribed to a time before the Spanish Conquest.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[82:12](cbc10.htm#fr_209.md) *Picil* originally
meant eight thousand; it was later reduced to a thousand.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[82:13](cbc10.htm#fr_210.md) "It is said that the
first founders of Chichen Itzá were not idolaters, until Kukulcan, a
Mexican captain, entered these provinces. He taught idolatry, as they
say it was he who taught it." Rel. de Yucatán, I, p. 270. This statement
was made repeatedly by the Indians to the first Spanish settlers.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[83:1](cbc10.htm#fr_211.md) A very slight change
in the text would make it read: "Many of the daughters of the towns went
with them to serve them, also."

<span id="fn_211"></span>[83:2](cbc10.htm#fr_212.md) See note
 [10](cbc07.htm#fn_62.md), p. 66 Chumayel.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[83:3](cbc10.htm#fr_213.md) Evidently a belief
existed that Maya civilization had lasted four baktuns and fifteen
katuns. These four complete baktuns might have been either Baktuns 8, 9,
10 and 11 or Baktuns 7, 8, 9 and 10. The latter alternative would take
us back to Spinden's Historical Era, 7.0.0.0.0. (Spinden 1924, p. 160),
and put the Spanish Conquest shortly after 11.15.0.0.0., 2 Ahau 8 Zac.
(*Cf.* p. 79, note  [12](cbc09.htm#fn_181)..md) In that case the date
9.0.0.0.0. would have fallen about the year 435 A.D.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[83:4](cbc10.htm#fr_214.md) The foreign Toltecs no
doubt brought disease into the country, just as the Spaniards did at a
later date.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[83:5](cbc10.htm#fr_215.md) Nacxit was one of the
Mexican names of Quetzalcoatl. Xuchit is an archaic form of the Aztec
*xochitl*, which means flower. We are reminded here of the well-known
erotic episode in the Quetzalcoatl legend.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[83:6](cbc10.htm#fr_216.md) We shall encounter a
number of references to these "two-day" or temporary rulers. They are
everywhere referred to as upstarts and usurpers. The following
statements of the Indians may cast some light on the matter. In answer
to the questions of the Spaniards as to the origin of the vaulted stone
buildings seen in the country, some of the natives replied that their
own ancestors had built them. "Others say that foreign immigrants
settled there, and that the natives put an end to them and killed them."
(Relaciones de Yucatan, I, p. 197). *Cf.* [p. 93](cbc14.htm#page_93.md) of
the present work.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[84:1](cbc10.htm#fr_217.md) It is difficult to
understand why the Itzá who had been so long in Yucatan should be called
foreigners. Possibly it was because they were still established at
Tayasal at the time this passage was written. in any case the Itzá are
denounced a number of times in these pages.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[84:2](cbc10.htm#fr_218.md) Under the Colonial
administration, unmarried youths and old men were exempt from tribute.
Probably this was also the case before the Spanish Conquest.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[84:3](cbc10.htm#fr_219.md) The confusion of this
narrative is probably due to the fact that while the writer was
referring ostensibly to the Itzá, he really had the Spaniards in mind.
He evidently shares the belief of some of the Spanish writers that the
Itzá migrated from northern Yucatan to avoid subjection to the
Spaniards, whose coming their prophets had foretold. *Cf.* Villagutierre
1701, p. 34.
