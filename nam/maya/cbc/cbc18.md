### (THE CREATION OF THE UINAL) <span id="fr_465"></span>[5](#fn_463.md)

Thus it was recorded &lt;by&gt; the first sage,
Melchise&lt;dek&gt;, <span id="fr_466"></span>[6](#fn_464.md) the first
prophet, Napuc Tun, <span id="fr_467"></span>[7](#fn_465.md) the priest,
the first priest. This is a song of how the *uinal* came to be created
before the creation of the world. <span id="fr_468"></span>[8](#fn_466.md)
Then he began to march by his own effort alone. Then said his maternal
grandmother, then said his maternal aunt, then said his paternal
grandmother, then said his sister-in-law: "What shall we say when we see
man on the road?" These were their words as they marched along, when
there was no man &lt;as yet&gt;. Then they arrived there in the east and
began to speak. "Who has passed here? Here are footprints. Measure it
off with your foot." So spoke the mistress of the world. <span
id="fr_469"></span>[9](#fn_467.md) Then he measured the footstep of our
Lord, God <span id="fr_470"></span>[10](#fn_468.md) the Father. This was
the reason it was called counting off the whole earth, *lahca* (12)
Oc. <span id="fr_471"></span>[11](#fn_469.md) This was the count, after it
had been created by &lt;the day&gt; 13 Oc, after his feet were joined
evenly, after they had departed there in the east. Then he spoke

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

its name when the day had no name, after he had marched along with his
maternal grandmother, his maternal aunt, his paternal grandmother and
his sister-in-law. The uinal was created, the day, as it was called, was
created, heaven and earth were created, the stairway <span
id="fr_472"></span>[1](#fn_470.md) of water, the earth, rocks and trees;
the things of the sea and the things of the land were created.

On 1 Chuen he raised himself to his divinity, after he had made heaven
and earth.

On 2 Eb he made the first stairway. It descended from the midst of the
heavens, in the midst of the water, when there were neither earth, rocks
nor trees.

On 3 Ben he made all things, as many as there are, the things of the
heavens, the things of the sea and the things of the earth. /

On 4 Ix sky and earth were tilted. <span id="fr_473"></span>[2](#fn_471.md)

On 5 Men he made everything.

On 6 Cib the first candle <span id="fr_474"></span>[3](#fn_472.md) was
made; it became light when there was neither sun nor moon.

On 7 Caban honey <span id="fr_475"></span>[4](#fn_473.md) was first
created, when we had none.

On 8 E¢nab his hand and foot were firmly set, then he picked up small
things on the ground.

On 9 Cauac hell was first considered.

On 10 Ahau wicked men went to hell because of God the Father, that they
might not be noticed.

On 11 Imix rocks and trees were formed; this he did within the day.

On 12 Ik the breath of life <span id="fr_476"></span>[5](#fn_474.md) was
created. The reason it was called Ik was because there was no death in
it.

On 13 Akbal he took water and watered the ground. Then he shaped it and
it became man.

On 1 Kan he first created anger because of the evil he had created.

On 2 Chicchan occurred the discovery of whatever evil he saw within the
town.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

On 3 Cimi he invented death; it happened that our Lord God invented the
first death. <span id="fr_477"></span>[1](#fn_475.md)

On 5 Lamat he established the seven great waters of the sea.

On 6 Muluc all valleys were submerged, when the world was not yet
created. <span id="fr_478"></span>[2](#fn_476.md) Then occurred the
invention of the word of our Lord God, when there was no word in heaven,
when there were neither rocks nor trees.

Then they went to consider &lt;what they were&gt;, and &lt;the voice&gt;
spoke as follows: /

|          |
|----------|
| p\. 62 C |

"Thirteen entities, seven entities, one." <span
id="fr_479"></span>[3](#fn_477.md) So it spoke when the word came forth, at
the time when there was no word. Then the reason was sought by the first
ruling day (the first day Ahau) why the meaning of the word to them was
not revealed <span id="fr_480"></span>[4](#fn_478.md) so that they could
declare themselves. Then they went to the center of heaven and joined
hands. Then the following were set up in the middle of the land: the
Burners, four of them:

|             |             |
|-------------|-------------|
| 4 Chicchan, | the Burner. |
| 4 Oc,       | the Burner. |
| 4 Men,      | the Burner. |
| 4 Ahau,     | the Burner. |

 

These are the four Rulers.

|          |     |                                                |

| 12 Ben   | 4   | 9 Akbal                                        |
| 13 Ix    | 5   | 10 Kan                                         |
| 1 Men    | 6   | 11 Chicchen                                    |
| 2 Cib    |     | 12 Cimi                                        |
| 3 Caban  | 7   | 13 Manik                                       |
| 4 E¢nab  |     | 1 Lamat <span id="fr_481"></span>[5](#fn_479.md), |

 

The day-name Oc is a homonym for the word meaning foot. Ix has a slight
resemblance to the root of *nixpahal* meaning to tilt. Men means to make
or to do something. The syllable *e¢* of E¢nab means to set something
firmly on the ground. Nevertheless the Maya were not unaware of the
relation between this day and the flint knife pictured by its glyph, for
in another manuscript we find it associated with a flint, as well as
with the blood-letter and the warrior, both of whom employed this
implement (Kaua, p. 21).

The association of the day Ahau with hell (*metnal*) may be because of
its resemblance to that of Cumhau (or Hun Ahau,) one of the names of the
god of the underworld and whom the author of the Motul Dictionary
identifies as "Lucifer, the prince of the devils." Akbal is associated
with the verb *akzah*, which means to water the ground. Chicchan
resembles *chictahal* which means to find. The day-name Cimi and the
Maya word meaning death are homonyms. Muluc resembles the verb
*mucchahal* meaning to be buried or submerged.}

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

The uinal was created, the earth was created; sky, earth, trees and
rocks were set in order; all things were created by our Lord God, the
Father. /

Thus he was there in his divinity, in the clouds, alone and by his own
effort, when he created the entire world, when he moved in the heavens
in his divinity. Thus he ruled in his great power. <span
id="fr_482"></span>[1](#fn_480.md) Every day is set in order according to
the count, beginning in the east, as it is arranged.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_463"></span>[116:5](cbc18.htm#fr_465.md) The Maya *uinal* was
a period of twenty days, each with a different name. The Maya year, or
*haab*, was composed of eighteen such uinals and a closing period of
five days known as *xma kaba kin*, or nameless days.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[116:6](cbc18.htm#fr_466.md) Written *Merchise* in
the Maya text. The presence of an r indicates a European word or name,
but it does not follow that it was an r in Spanish. R and l sounded
alike to the Maya ear, and in native documents we find the name Melchor
written Merchor. We have already seen Bible names piously interpolated
in native legends. The last syllable is here supplied by the translator.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[116:7](cbc18.htm#fr_467.md) A famous Maya prophet
who foretold the coming of the Spaniards. See Appendix D.

<span id="fn_466"></span>[116:8](cbc18.htm#fr_468.md) *Tima to ahac cab*;
this could also be translated: before it dawned.

<span id="fn_467"></span>[116:9](cbc18.htm#fr_469.md) The mistress of the
world. *Cf.* 114, note  [6](cbc17.htm#fn_437.md).

<span id="fn_468"></span>[116:10](cbc18.htm#fr_470.md) Alternative
translation: Then our Lord, God the Father, measured his footstep.

<span id="fn_469"></span>[116:11](cbc18.htm#fr_471.md) In other words, the
day 12 Oc (*lahca Oc*) is derived from the phrase, *xoc lah cab oc*,
which means counting off the whole world by footsteps.

<span id="fn_470"></span>[117:1](cbc18.htm#fr_472.md) Maya *eb* is the name
of one of the days, and also means stairway. It is probably derived from
*e*, a point, and refers to a series of points or indentations (Seler
1902, p. 482). Why it is connected with water is uncertain, but the fact
is confirmed on page 74 of the Dresden Codex. Here we see the old
goddess with the jaguar claws emptying a jar of water upon the earth,
and in the descending stream of water is pictured the day-sign Eb.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[117:2](cbc18.htm#fr_473.md) Possibly a reference
to the horizon where earth and sky meet.

<span id="fn_472"></span>[117:3](cbc18.htm#fr_474.md) *Cib*, which has
meant candle since the Spanish occupation, appears to have always been
the word for wax. We can find no evidence of the use of candles before
the Conquest, but according to the reports of the Sixteenth Century
settlers there was such an extensive trade in beeswax that it is
difficult to believe that it dated only from the Spanish occupation of
the country (Relaciones de Yucatan). *Cf.* p. 101, note
 [6](cbc15.htm#fn_325.md).

<span id="fn_473"></span>[117:4](cbc18.htm#fr_475.md) *Cab*, here
translated as honey, could also mean the earth.

<span id="fn_474"></span>[117:5](cbc18.htm#fr_476.md) *Ik* can mean either
wind or the breath of life. The context appears to call for the latter
rendering.

<span id="fn_475"></span>[118:1](cbc18.htm#fr_477.md) Following the day 3
Cimi, 4 Manik is omitted.

<span id="fn_476"></span>[118:2](cbc18.htm#fr_478.md) Possibly a reference
to the belief in a previous creation which was destroyed by water.
Throughout this passage everything that occurred is told in language
which is a play of words on the name of the day.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[118:3](cbc18.htm#fr_479.md) The twenty day-names
were combined with the numbers one to thirteen. When the numerical
series of thirteen was completed, it began over again and was repeated
for seven days more. Consequently we have 13 days + 7 days = 1 *uinal*.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[118:4](cbc18.htm#fr_480.md) *Hepahac*, here
translated as revealed, literally means opened, like a door.

<span id="fn_479"></span>[118:5](cbc18.htm#fr_481.md) This series of twenty
days could be the first *uinal* of a Year 8 Muluc which recurred every
52 years. From the time of the Conquest down to the compilation of the
Chumayel, this year could have fallen in 1562, 1614, 1666, 1718 and
1770. The meaning of the numbers between the columns of days is not
clear. If it is a secondary count beginning on the day 6 Ahau, then 13
Manik is wrongly numbered 7.

<span id="fn_480"></span>[119:1](cbc18.htm#fr_482.md) Among the modern
Jacalteca Indians it is still believed that the days were once men who
lived on the earth. They were rulers who protected the village or
divided the land (Lafarge and Byers 1931, p. 159).
