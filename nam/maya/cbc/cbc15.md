### (THE CREATION OF THE WORLD) <span id="fr_298"></span>[2](#fn_297.md)

It is most necessary to believe this. These are the precious stones
which our Lord, the Father, has abandoned. <span
id="fr_299"></span>[3](#fn_298.md) This was his first repast, this
*balché*, <span id="fr_300"></span>[4](#fn_299.md) with which we, the
ruling men revere him here. Very rightly <span
id="fr_301"></span>[5](#fn_300.md) they worshipped as true gods these
precious stones, <span id="fr_302"></span>[6](#fn_301.md) when the true God
was established, our Lord God, the Lord of heaven and earth, the true
God. Nevertheless, the first gods were perishable gods. Their worship
came to its inevitable end. They lost their efficacy by the benediction
of the Lord of Heaven, after the redemption of the world was
accomplished, after the resurrection of the true God, the true Dios,
when he blessed heaven and earth. Then was your worship abolished, Maya
men. Turn away your hearts from your &lt;old&gt; religion.

&lt;This is&gt; the history of the world in those times, because it has
been written down, because the time has not yet ended for making these
books, these many explanations, so that Maya men may be asked if they
know how they were born here in this country, when the land was founded.

 <span id="fr_303"></span>[1](#fn_302.md) It was &lt;Katun&gt; 11 Ahau when
the *Ah Mucenca* <span id="fr_304"></span>[2](#fn_303.md) came forth to
blindfold the faces of the Oxlahun-ti-ku; <span
id="fr_305"></span>[3](#fn_304.md) but they did not know his name, except
for his older sister and his sons. They said his face had not yet been
shown to them also. This was after the creation of the world had been
completed, but they did not know it was about to occur. Then
Oxlahun-ti-ku was seized by Bolon-ti-ku. <span
id="fr_306"></span>[4](#fn_305.md) Then it was that fire descended, then
the rope descended, then rocks and trees descended. <span
id="fr_307"></span>[5](#fn_306.md) Then came the beating of &lt;things&gt;
with wood and stone. Then Oxlahun-ti-ku /

was seized, his head was wounded, his face was buffeted, he was spit
upon, and he was &lt;thrown&gt; on his back as well. After that he was
despoiled of his insignia <span id="fr_308"></span>[6](#fn_307.md) and his
smut. <span id="fr_309"></span>[7](#fn_308.md) Then shoots of the yaxum
tree <span id="fr_310"></span>[8](#fn_309.md) were taken. Also Lima beans
were taken with crumbled tubercles, hearts of small squash-seeds, large
squash-seeds <span id="fr_311"></span>[9](#fn_310.md) and beans, all
crushed. He wrapped up the seeds &lt;composing&gt; this first Bolon
<u>¢</u>acab, <span id="fr_312"></span>[10](#fn_311.md) and went to the
thirteenth heaven. <span id="fr_313"></span>[11](#fn_312.md) Then a mass of
maize-dough with the tips of corn-cobs remained here on earth. Then its
heart departed because of Oxlahun-ti-ku, but they did not know the heart
of the tubercle was gone. After that the fatherless ones, the miserable
ones, and those without husbands were all pierced through; <span
id="fr_314"></span>[12](#fn_313.md) they were alive though they had no
hearts. Then they were buried in the sands, in the sea.

There would be a sudden rush of water when the theft of the
insignia <span id="fr_315"></span>[13](#fn_314.md) &lt;of Oxlahun-ti-ku&gt;
occurred. Then the sky would fall, it would fall down

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

upon the earth, when the four gods, the four Bacabs, were set up, who
brought about the destruction of the world. <span
id="fr_316"></span>[1](#fn_315.md) Then, after the destruction of the world
was completed, they placed &lt;a tree &gt; <span
id="fr_317"></span>[2](#fn_316.md) to set up in its order the yellow cock
oriole. Then the white tree of abundance was set up. A pillar of the sky
was set up, a sign of the destruction of the world; that was the white
tree of abundance in the north. Then the black tree of abundance was set
up &lt;in

the west&gt; <span id="fr_318"></span>[3](#fn_317.md) for the
black-breasted *pi¢oy* <span id="fr_319"></span>[4](#fn_318.md) to sit
upon. Then the yellow tree of abundance was set up &lt;in the
south&gt;, <span id="fr_320"></span>[5](#fn_319.md) as a symbol of the
destruction of the world, for the yellow-breasted *pi¢oy* to sit upon,
for the yellow cock oriole to sit upon, the yellow timid *mut*. Then the
green tree of abundance was set up in the center &lt;of the world&gt; as
a record of the destruction of the world.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

The plate <span id="fr_321"></span>[1](#fn_320.md) of another katun was set
up and fixed in its place by the messengers of their lord. The red
Piltec was set at the east of the world to conduct people to his lord.
The white Piltec was set at the north of the world to conduct people /

to his lord. Lahun Chaan <span id="fr_322"></span>[2](#fn_321.md) was set
&lt;at the west&gt; to bring things to his lord. The yellow Piltec was
set &lt;at the south&gt; to bring things to his lord. But it was
&lt;over&gt; the whole world that Ah Uuc Cheknal <span
id="fr_323"></span>[3](#fn_322.md) was set up. He came from the seventh
stratum of the earth, when he came to fecundate Itzam-kab-ain, <span
id="fr_324"></span>[4](#fn_323.md) when he came with the vitality of the
angle between earth &lt;and&gt; heaven. <span
id="fr_325"></span>[5](#fn_324.md) They moved among the four lights, <span
id="fr_326"></span>[6](#fn_325.md) among the four layers of the stars. The
world was not lighted; there was neither day nor night nor moon. Then
they perceived that the world was being created. Then creation dawned
upon the world.✠ During the creation thirteen infinite

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

series <span id="fr_327"></span>[1](#fn_326.md) &lt;added&gt; to seven was
the count of the creation of the world. Then a new world dawned for
them.

The two-day throne was declared, the three-day throne. Then began the
weeping of Oxlahun-ti-ku. They wept in this reign. The reign became red;
the mat became red; the first tree of the world was rooted fast. <span
id="fr_328"></span>[2](#fn_327.md) The entire world was proclaimed by
Uuc-yol-zip; <span id="fr_329"></span>[3](#fn_328.md) but it was not at the
time of this reign that Bolon-ti-ku-wept. Then came the counting of the
mat in its order. <span id="fr_330"></span>[4](#fn_329.md) Red was the mat
on which Bolon-ti-ku sat. His buttock is sharply rounded, <span
id="fr_331"></span>[5](#fn_330.md) as he sits on his mat. Then descended
greed from the heart of the sky, greed for power, greed for rule.

Then the red foundation was established; the white foundation of the
ruler was established; the black foundation was established; the yellow
foundation was established. <span id="fr_332"></span>[6](#fn_331.md) Then
the Red Ruler was set up, he who was raised <span
id="fr_333"></span>[7](#fn_332.md) upon the mat, raised upon the throne.
The White Ruler was set up, he who was raised upon the mat, raised upon
the throne. The Black Ruler was set up, he who was raised upon the mat,
raised upon the throne. The Yellow Ruler was set up, he who was raised
upon the mat, raised upon the throne. <span
id="fr_334"></span>[8](#fn_333.md)

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

\[paragraph continues\] As a god, it is said; <span
id="fr_335"></span>[1](#fn_334.md) whether or not gods, their bread is
lacking, their water is lacking. /

There was only a portion &lt;of what was needed&gt; for them to eat
together . . . <span id="fr_336"></span>[2](#fn_335.md) but there was
nowhere from which the quantity needed for existence could come.
Compulsion and force were the tidings, when he <span
id="fr_337"></span>[3](#fn_336.md) was seated &lt;in authority&gt;;
compulsion was the tidings, compulsion by misery; it came during his
reign, when he arrived to sit upon the mat ... <span
id="fr_338"></span>[2](#fn_335.md) Suddenly on high fire flamed up. The
face of the sun was snatched away, <span id="fr_339"></span>[4](#fn_337.md)
taken from earth. This was his garment in his reign. This was the reason
for mourning his power, at that time there was too much vigor. At that
time there was the riddle for the rulers. <span
id="fr_340"></span>[5](#fn_338.md) The planted timber was set up.
Perishable things are assembled at that time. <span
id="fr_341"></span>[6](#fn_339.md) The timber of the grave-digger is set up
at the crossroads, at the four resting places. <span
id="fr_342"></span>[7](#fn_340.md) Sad is the general havoc, <span
id="fr_343"></span>[8](#fn_341.md) at that time the butterflies swarmed.
Then there came great misery, when it came about that the sun in Katun 3
Ahau was moved from its place for three months. After three years <span
id="fr_344"></span>[9](#fn_342.md) it will come back into place in Katun 3
Ahau. Then another katun will beset &lt;in its place&gt;. The
*ramon* <span id="fr_345"></span>[10](#fn_343.md) fruit is their bread, the
*ramon* fruit is their drink; the *jícama cimarrona* <span
id="fr_346"></span>[11](#fn_344.md) is their bread, the *jícama cimarrona*
is their drink; what they eat and what they drink. The *ix-batun*, <span
id="fr_347"></span>[12](#fn_345.md) the

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

c~~h~~imchim-c~~h~~ay, <span id="fr_348"></span>[1](#fn_346.md) are what
they eat. These things were present here when misery settled, father, in
Tun 9. At that time there were the foreigners. The charge &lt;of
misery&gt; was sought for all the years <span
id="fr_349"></span>[2](#fn_347.md) of &lt;Katun&gt; 13 Ahau. <span
id="fr_350"></span>[3](#fn_348.md)

Then it was that the lord of &lt;Katun&gt; 11 Ahau spread his feet
apart. Then it was that the word of Bolon <u>¢</u>acab <span
id="fr_351"></span>[4](#fn_349.md) descended to the tip of his tongue. Then
the charge of the katun was sought; nine was its charge when it
descended from heaven. Kan was the day when its burden was bound to
it. <span id="fr_352"></span>[5](#fn_350.md) Then the water descended, it
came from the heart of the sky for the baptism <span
id="fr_353"></span>[6](#fn_351.md) of the House of Nine Bushes. With it
descended Bolon Mayel; <span id="fr_354"></span>[7](#fn_352.md) sweet was
his mouth and the tip of his tongue. Sweet were his brains. Then
descended the four mighty supernatural jars, this was the honey of the
flowers. <span id="fr_355"></span>[8](#fn_353.md) /

Then there grew up for it the red unfolded calyx, <span
id="fr_356"></span>[9](#fn_354.md) the white unfolded calyx, the black
unfolded calyx and the yellow unfolded calyx, those which were half a
palm &lt;broad&gt; and those which were a whole palm &lt;in breadth&gt;.
Then there sprang up the five-leafed <span
id="fr_357"></span>[10](#fn_355.md) flower, the five drooping
&lt;petals&gt;, the cacao &lt;with grains like&gt; a row of teeth, the
*ix-chabil-tok*, the little flower, <span
id="fr_358"></span>[11](#fn_356.md) Ix Macuil Xuchit, <span
id="fr_359"></span>[12](#fn_357.md) the flower with the brightly
colored <span id="fr_360"></span>[13](#fn_358.md) tip, the *laurel* <span
id="fr_361"></span>[14](#fn_359.md) flower, and the limping flower. <span
id="fr_362"></span>[15](#fn_360.md) After these flowers sprang up, there
were the vendors

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

of fragrant odors, <span id="fr_363"></span>[1](#fn_361.md) there was the
mother <span id="fr_364"></span>[2](#fn_362.md) of the flowers. Then there
sprang up the bouquet of the priest, the bouquet of the ruler, the
bouquet of the captain; this was what the flower-king bore when he
descended and nothing else, so they say. <span
id="fr_365"></span>[3](#fn_363.md) It was not bread that he bore. Then it
was that the flower sprang up, wide open, to introduce the sin of
Bolon-ti-ku. &lt;After&gt; three years was the time when he said he did
not come to create Bolon <u>¢</u>acab as the god in hell. Then descended
Ppizlimtec <span id="fr_366"></span>[4](#fn_364.md) to take the
flower; <span id="fr_367"></span>[5](#fn_365.md) he took the figure of a
humming-bird with green plumage on its breast, when he descended. Then
he sucked the honey from the flower with nine petals. Then the
five-petaled flower took him for her husband, <span
id="fr_368"></span>[6](#fn_366.md) Thereupon the heart of the flower came
forth to set itself in motion. Four-fold <span
id="fr_369"></span>[7](#fn_367.md) was the plate of the flower, and Ah Kin
Xocbiltun <span id="fr_370"></span>[8](#fn_368.md) was set in the center.
At this time Oxlahun-ti-ku came forth, but he did not know of the
descent of the sin of the mat, when he came into his power. The
flower <span id="fr_371"></span>[9](#fn_369.md) was his mat, the flower was
his chair. He sat in envy, he walked in envy. Envy was his plate, envy
was his cup. There was envy in his heart, in his understanding, in his
thought and in his speech. Ribald and insolent was his speech during his
reign. At that time his food cries out, his drink cries out, <span
id="fr_372"></span>[10](#fn_370.md) from the corner of his mouth when he
eats, from the back of his claw <span id="fr_373"></span>[11](#fn_371.md)
when he bites his food. He holds in his hand a piece of wood, <span
id="fr_374"></span>[12](#fn_372.md) he holds in his hand a stone.
Mighty <span id="fr_375"></span>[13](#fn_373.md) are his teeth; his face is
that of Lahun Chan, <span id="fr_376"></span>[14](#fn_374.md) as he sits.
Sin is &lt;in&gt; his face, in his speech, in his talk, in his
understanding &lt;and in&gt; his walk. His eyes are blindfolded. <span
id="fr_377"></span>[15](#fn_375.md) He

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

seizes, he demands as his right, <span id="fr_378"></span>[1](#fn_376.md)
the mat on which he sits /

|          |

| p\. 47 C |

during his reign. Forgotten is his father, forgotten is his mother, nor
does his mother know her offspring. The heart is on fire alone in the
fatherless one who despises his father, in the motherless one. He shall
walk abroad giving the appearance of one drunk, without understanding,
in company with his father, in company with his mother. There is no
virtue in him, there is no goodness in his heart, only a little on the
tip of his tongue. He does not know in what manner his end is to come;
nor does he know what will be the end of his reign, when the period of
his power shall terminate.

 <span id="fr_379"></span>[2](#fn_377.md)This is Bolon-ti-ku. &lt;Like that
of&gt; Bolon Chan <span id="fr_380"></span>[3](#fn_378.md) is the face of
the ruler of men, the two day occupant of the mat and throne. He came in
Katun 3 Ahau. After that there will be another lord of the land who will
establish the law <span id="fr_381"></span>[4](#fn_379.md) of another
katun, after the law of the lord of Katun 3 Ahau shall have run its
course. At that time there shall be few children; then there shall be
mourning among the Itza who speak our language brokenly. <span
id="fr_382"></span>[5](#fn_380.md) Industry <span
id="fr_383"></span>[6](#fn_381.md) &lt;and&gt; vigor finally take the
place, in the first tun &lt;of the new katun&gt;, of the sin of the Itzá
who speak our language brokenly. It is Bolon-ti-ku who shall come to his
end &lt;with&gt; the law of the lord of Katun 3 Ahau. Then the riddle of
the rulers of the land shall end the law of the katun. Then those of the
lineage of the noble chiefs shall come into their own, <span
id="fr_384"></span>[7](#fn_382.md) with the other men of discretion and
with those of the lineage of the chiefs. Their faces had been trampled
on the ground, and they had been overthrown by the unrestrained upstarts
of the day and of the katun, the son of evil and the offspring of the
harlot, who were born when their day dawned in Katun 3 Ahau. Thus shall
end the power of those who are two-faced toward our Lord God.

But when the law of the katun shall have run its course, then God will
bring about a great deluge again which will be the end of the world.
When

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

this is over, then our Lord Jesus Christ shall descend over the valley
of Jehoshaphat beside the town of Jerusalem /

|          |

where he redeemed us with his holy blood. He shall descend on a great
cloud to bear true testimony that he was once obliged to suffer,
stretched out on a cross of wood. Then shall descend in his great power
and glory the true God who created heaven and earth and everything on
earth. He shall descend to level off the world for the good and the bad,
the conquerors &lt;and&gt; the captives. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_297"></span>[98:2](cbc15.htm#fr_298.md) Here we have a
creation narrative of the sort described by Aguilar in his report on
idolatry in Yucatan written early in the Seventeenth Century.
"Furthermore it would be very advantageous if books were printed in the
language of these Indians which would treat of Genesis and the creation
of the world, because they have fables and histories which are very
detrimental. Some of them have had them written down, and they keep them
and read them in their assemblies. I had a copybook of this sort, which
I took away from a choir-master named Cuytun from the town of Sucopo. He
got away from me, and I never could get hold of him to learn the origin
of this Genesis of his" (Aguilar 1900, p. 115).

<span id="fn_298"></span>[98:3](cbc15.htm#fr_299.md) This expresses
admirably the religious attitude of the Maya who seem capable of
superimposing Christianity on their old faith. See Appendix G.

<span id="fn_299"></span>[98:4](cbc15.htm#fr_300.md) See p. 95, note
 [2](cbc14.htm#fn_271.md).

<span id="fn_300"></span>[98:5](cbc15.htm#fr_301.md) Maya, *pay bentzil*,
employed as a synonym for *tibil* in Crónica de Oxkutzcab (Gates
reproduction, Plates 161 and 166).

<span id="fn_301"></span>[98:6](cbc15.htm#fr_302.md) These may be what
Avendaño refers to when he tells of the "devil" and "the worship which
they (the Itzá) pay to him in the form of some stones" (Means 1917, p.
141. *Cf.* Appendix D).

<span id="fn_302"></span>[99:1](cbc15.htm#fr_303.md) Parallel versions of
this passage occur in the Mani (p. 161) and the Tizimin (p. 20) MSS.
Juan Martinez H. (1913, pp. 164-171) has made an excellent translation
of the first part of this narrative, and suggests that the accompanying
head of the "lord" of the katun is blurred in order to indicate that he
is blindfolded.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[99:2](cbc15.htm#fr_304.md) Ah Mucencab: See p.
64, note  [4](cbc06.htm#fn_38.md).

<span id="fn_304"></span>[99:3](cbc15.htm#fr_305.md) Oxlahun-ti-ku,
literally the Thirteen Gods, are probably the gods of the thirteen
heavens of the Maya cosmos, but they are usually treated as a single
god.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[99:4](cbc15.htm#fr_306.md) Bolon-ti-ku, or Nine
Gods, appear to be treated as one god. We find them represented in the
inscriptions, and it seems likely that they represent the nine
underworlds and correspond to the Nine Lords of the Night of the
Mexicans. (*Cf.* J. E. Thompson 1929, p. 225, and Seler 1923, p. 31.)

<span id="fn_306"></span>[99:5](cbc15.htm#fr_307.md) *Cf.* Motul, p. 346:
"*Eman u che u tunich Dios coklal*: The punishment of God has come upon
us with deaths or pestilence."

<span id="fn_307"></span>[99:6](cbc15.htm#fr_308.md) *Cf.* p. 67, note
 [5](cbc07.htm#fn_68.md).

<span id="fn_308"></span>[99:7](cbc15.htm#fr_309.md) Maya idol-makers
removed the smut from their faces as a sign that their period of fast
and consecration was over (Landa 1929, p. 70).

<span id="fn_309"></span>[99:8](cbc15.htm#fr_310.md) We have a Maya homonym
here, and possibly quetzal plumage is meant by *ix kukil ix yaxum*.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[99:9](cbc15.htm#fr_311.md) The seeds of the
unidentified striped squash called *ca*.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[99:10](cbc15.htm#fr_312.md) Lit. nine
generations, or eternal. According to Landa (1929, p. 20), Bolon
<u>¢</u>acab was set up in the house of the chief as a sort of tutelary
god of the Kan years. He appears to be closely associated with the
rain-god, Chac, and is identified by Seler as the god usually designated
by the letter K. Seler 1902, p. 377. We are reminded of the Mexican
image of Tlaloc composed of seeds.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[99:11](cbc15.htm#fr_313.md) Lit. "the 13th layer
of the sky."

<span id="fn_313"></span>[99:12](cbc15.htm#fr_314.md) "pierced through:"
The Tizimin and Mani versions say: "fell to pieces," (*hutlahi*).

<span id="fn_314"></span>[99:13](cbc15.htm#fr_315.md) See p. 67, note
 [5](cbc07.htm#fn_68.md).

<span id="fn_315"></span>[100:1](cbc15.htm#fr_316.md) Like the Mexicans,
the Maya believed that the present order was preceded by other worlds
which had been destroyed. According to the former, the fourth of these
worlds, or "Suns," was destroyed by a great flood of water (Seler 1923,
p. 40).

<span id="fn_316"></span>[100:2](cbc15.htm#fr_317.md) Supplied from the
Tizimin and Mani versions. This was the red *imix*-tree which was set up
in the east, for the *Kan-xib-yuy*, or *Kan-xib-yuyum*, to sit upon.
(*Cf.* Mani MS. p. 162.)

<span id="fn_317"></span>[100:3](cbc15.htm#fr_318.md) Supplied from the
Tizimin and Mani versions of this narrative.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[100:4](cbc15.htm#fr_319.md) *Pi¢oy* is spelled
three ways in the three versions. The context leaves little doubt that a
bird is meant. It may have been something like the *mut*, an
unidentified bird of the Cracidæ family (*Cf.* Maler 1908, p. 132).

<span id="fn_319"></span>[100:5](cbc15.htm#fr_320.md) We find a portrayal
of four trees, each surmounted by a bird, in one of the reliefs of the
Temple of the Wall Panels at Chichen Itzá. (*Cf.* Plate [1,
c](cbc03.htm#img_pl1c)..md) Also on page 1 of the Codex Fejérváry-Mayer
there is a Mexican picture of the four world-quarters at each of which
there is a flowering tree with a bird perched upon it (Apud Seler 1923,
p. 15). The *yax-che* or green tree at the center of the world is
probably shown on pages 41-42 of the Maya Codex Cortesianus. This last
tree is still remembered by the Maya (*Cf.* Tozzer 1907, p. 154). In the
Ritual of the Four World Quarters found in Chapter I of the present
work, these *imix*-trees, or trees of abundance, are further qualified
as being the ceiba tree so prominent in Maya mythology (*Cf.* p. 64,
note  [5](cbc06.htm#fn_39).md).

<span id="fn_320"></span>[101:1](cbc15.htm#fr_321.md) Mention of the
"plate" and "cup" of the katun is found several times in the Books of
Chilam Balam. it is probably a reference to the ceremonies connected
with the so-called idol of the katun (*Cf.* Landa 1929, p. 98). These
articles appear to symbolize the numerical coefficient of the day Ahau
from which the katun took its name. On page [150](cbc27.htm#page_150.md) it
is said of Katun 9 Ahau: "Nine was its plate, nine was its cup."

<span id="fn_321"></span>[101:2](cbc15.htm#fr_322.md) Lahun Chaan is
doubtless the same as the "Lakunchan" described by Cogolludo as an idol
with very ugly teeth. *Lahun* means ten in both Maya and Chol, and
*chan* means sky, heaven and serpent in Chol. The Maya word for sky is
*caan*. It seems likely that Lahun Chaan is a borrowed foreign word and
means the god of the tenth heaven. On page 47 of the Dresden Codex we
find a picture ([fig. 24](#img_fig24).md) accompanied by a glyph composed
of the number ten and an element which is generally accepted as the
symbol of the sky or heavens. The picture is that of a deity whose face
resembles that of the God B, or rain-god; but it lacks the curved
ornament over the nose, and instead of the protruding tooth at the side
of the mouth there is a fleshless lower jaw. Also skeleton-like ribs are
painted on the front of the torso. We recall that a fleshless jawbone is
one of the symbols of the number ten on the monuments; but the figure
appears to be the regent of the second Venus period in the Dresden
Codex, and the regent of the first of these periods in the Mexican Codex
Bologna also has a fleshless lower jaw. Since the above passage in the
Chumayel implies that Lahun Chaan was set in the west, the translator is
inclined to believe that this god was closely connected with the
appearance of Venus as an evening star. Cogolludo's mention of the "ugly
teeth" may be a reference to the fleshless lower jaw in the picture
(*Cf.* Cogolludo Bk. 4, Chap. 8).

<span id="fn_322"></span>[101:3](cbc15.htm#fr_323.md) Ah Uuc Chek-nal: he
who fertilizes the maize seven times.

<span id="fn_323"></span>[101:4](cbc15.htm#fr_324.md) Itzam-kab-ain:
literally, the whale with the feet of a crocodile. Martinez 1913,
reprint p. 5. Beltran spells it Itzam-cab-ain, and defines it simply as
whale, though it could mean literally Itzam-the-earth-crocodile. In
either case, we are forcibly reminded of the fabled earth-monster which
appears in the Dresden Codex (pp. 4 and 5) with the head of Itzamná
between its jaws.

The Mexicans believed that the gods created "in the water a great fish,
which is called *cipáctli* and which is like a crocodile, and from this
fish they made the earth" (Hist. de los Mexicanos por sus pinturas,
Chap. 2). On page 27 of the Codex Borgia we see this earth-monster with
the head and claws of a crocodile and with maize sprouting from its back
(Seler 1923, pp. 10, 11).

<span id="fn_324"></span>[101:5](cbc15.htm#fr_325.md) A change of one
letter (*tu muk* to *tamuk*) would give to this sentence the meaning:
then he descended while the heavens rubbed against the earth.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[101:6](cbc15.htm#fr_326.md) Maya, *can cib*,
literally four wax candles. *Cib* is also the word for beeswax, but we
find no record of candles being used prior to the Spanish conquest. The
Maya employed torches of pitch-pine (*tahté*) or of the *Viguiera
dentata* HBK (*tah*) for lighting. Thompson believes, however, that wax
was used by the Maya for ceremonial purposes before the Conquest (J. E.
Thompson, 1930, p. 105).

<span id="fn_326"></span>[102:1](cbc15.htm#fr_327.md) <u>¢</u>ac, here
translated as series, also means degrees, steps, stairs and other things
which go above one another. Motul.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[102:2](cbc15.htm#fr_328.md) The yax-cheel-cab, or
first tree of the world is believed to be a giant ceiba which grows in
the exact center of the earth and rears its branches through successive
holes in the various heavens (Tozzer 1907, p. 154). Avendaño describes
the representation of this mythological tree as "the fragment of a
column, of round stone, the circumference of each part of which is about
three quarters of a yard across and one quarter high. It is made of
stones placed on top of each other with mortar of lime and *cah cab*
(*zahcab*), which is usually used for that purpose; and the middle is
filled in with bitumen, so that it is like a table with a round
pedestal, upon which and set in the foundation of the said stone column,
there stands out toward the West a stone mask, very ill-formed . . . The
said column is called, in the name by which they worship it, Yax cheel
cab, which means in their language, 'the first tree in the world,' and,
as it is understood in their old songs (which few people understand)
they wish to have it known they worship it because it was the tree of
whose fruit our first father Adam ate, who in their language is called
Ixanom" (Means 1917, p. 135).

<span id="fn_328"></span>[102:3](cbc15.htm#fr_329.md) *Cf.* p. 157, note
 [2](cbc27.htm#fn_803.md).

<span id="fn_329"></span>[102:4](cbc15.htm#fr_330.md) *Cf.* p. 72, note
 [13](cbc07.htm#fn_115.md).

<span id="fn_330"></span>[102:5](cbc15.htm#fr_331.md) Maya: *¢ut polbil*.
*<u>¢</u>ut* means pointed like a hat. (Dict. San Francisco.) *Polbil*
is defined as either rounded or shaped. The description fits the
representations of the death-god in the Dresden Codex. (Pp. 10, 11, 12,
13 and 19.) As ruler of the ninth and deepest hell, he sits upon the
mat, the symbol of authority, and comprises in himself the idea of the
gods of the nine under-worlds. *Cf.* Codex Vaticanus No. 3738, f. l v.
apud Seler 1923, p. 21.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[102:6](cbc15.htm#fr_332.md) Probably the bases or
pedestals on which the following deities were set.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[102:7](cbc15.htm#fr_333.md) Written *ah ten pop
ah ten ¢am* in our text, but in the Mani and Tizimin MSS., *ah tem pop
ah tem ¢am*. *Tem* is an altar or bench, and in compounds something set
above something else. *Tem* is also a verbal stem meaning to alleviate.
The mat (*pop*) and throne (¢am) have the figurative significance of
toil, misery and misfortune. (Motul, 1930, p. 694.) Consequently the
expression could also mean "he who alleviates misfortunes." *Cf.*
Tizimin, pp. 7, 8 and 25; Codex Perez, pp. 78, 82, 83, 107, 108, 153 and
161.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[102:8](cbc15.htm#fr_334.md) The Red, White, Black
and Yellow "Rulers" appear to be the four gods who presided at the four
cardinal points. Each is qualified by the adjective, *tenel*, which we
believe to mean "raised up." It is probably an obsolete word, and we
find *temal* substituted for it in the Mani MS. (Codex Perez, p. 116.) A
discussion of the gods of the cardinal points will be found in Appendix
A.

<span id="fn_334"></span>[103:1](cbc15.htm#fr_335.md) Maya, *tu than*. An
expression often found in the medical manuscripts, meaning "so people
say" or "so they call it," referring to various names applied to the
same disease. *Cf.* Roys 1931, p. 16.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[103:2](cbc15.htm#fr_338.md) Lacuna in the text

<span id="fn_336"></span>[103:3](cbc15.htm#fr_337.md) Referring to
Bolon-ti-ku.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[103:4](cbc15.htm#fr_339.md) Maya, *colop*,
translated as though it were *colob*.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[103:5](cbc15.htm#fr_340.md) A reference to the
interrogation of the chiefs. *Cf.* Chapter IX.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[103:6](cbc15.htm#fr_341.md) Maya, *zatay
babalil*. This has been translated as it stands, but in connection with
the "riddle for the rulers" we suspect that *zatay batabil* is intended.
This would mean that the chiefs who are about to perish are assembled.
*Cf.* Chapter IX.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[103:7](cbc15.htm#fr_342.md) This expression, *to
ho&lt;l&gt; can be, tu ho&lt;l&gt; can heleb*, has been corrected from
page 166 of the Kaua MS. Literally it means the four openings where two
roads cross, the openings between the four resting places, i.e. the four
corners at the cross-roads where travelers set down their packs and
rested. Such would be a convenient place for an ambuscade, and here the
slain would be buried. *Ah muuc*, here translated as gravedigger, means
anyone who buries or conceals anything.

<span id="fn_341"></span>[103:8](cbc15.htm#fr_343.md) Maya, *bul cum*,
might mean "all down" literally. Its translation here is based on the
contexts in which it occurs. Always it is sad and to be mourned. On page
91 of the previous chapter it occurs in the courtyards of the nobles on
an occasion when a number of chiefs are killed for failing to pass the
test. Here it occurs at the cross-roads. In the prophecy for Katun 1
Ahau we shall find it closely associated with the flies (swarming on the
corpses?) and mentioned in the same category with pestilence, famine and
sudden death. It is an archaic expression and does not occur in any of
the old dictionaries.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[103:9](cbc15.htm#fr_344.md) Lit. "three heaps of
years." The translation of this sentence is uncertain.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[103:10](cbc15.htm#fr_345.md) The fruit of the
*ramon* (*Brosimum alicastrum* Sw.) is boiled and eaten alone or with
honey or corn-meal, and a sort of bread is made of the ground seeds.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[103:11](cbc15.htm#fr_346.md) The root of the
*Jícama cimarrona* (*Calopogonium cæruleum*, Benth.) is eaten in time of
famine. Dicc. San Francisco.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[103:12](cbc15.htm#fr_347.md) *Ix-batun*, or
*batun*, is probably an unidentified wild plant or tree. Batun is a
common family name among the Maya.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[104:1](cbc15.htm#fr_348.md)
C~~h~~inchin-c~~h~~ay, a very spiny variety of *Jatropha aconitifolia*
Mill., is boiled like cabbages and eaten when the corn crop fails
(Relaciones de Yucatan, 1, p. 299).

<span id="fn_347"></span>[104:2](cbc15.htm#fr_349.md) A record of the
misfortunes of each of the twenty years of a certain Katun 5 Ahau is
found in the Tizimin (pp. 1-13) and Mani (pp. 135-156) manuscripts.

<span id="fn_348"></span>[104:3](cbc15.htm#fr_350.md) Most of the preceding
paragraph concerning Katun 3 Ahau appears to be an interpolation. It is
not found in the Tizimin and Mani versions.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[104:4](cbc15.htm#fr_351.md) Bolon <u>¢</u>acab:
*Cf.* p. 99, note  [10](#fn_311.md).

<span id="fn_350"></span>[104:5](cbc15.htm#fr_352.md) *Cf.* Stela D, Copan
(apud Morley 1915, Pl. 14) where the personified numeral is the bearer
and the time-period is the burden.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[104:6](cbc15.htm#fr_353.md) Alternative
translation: for the rebirth etc.

<span id="fn_352"></span>[104:7](cbc15.htm#fr_354.md) Bolon Mayel means
"the fragrant one."

<span id="fn_353"></span>[104:8](cbc15.htm#fr_355.md) For this sentence the
following is substituted in the Mani and Tizimin versions of this
narrative: "Then descended two mighty demon bats who sucked the honey of
the flowers."

<span id="fn_354"></span>[104:9](cbc15.htm#fr_356.md) Unfolded calyx (*hoch
kom*): *hoch* has a number of different meanings, but in the Tizimin and
Mani versions *choch* is substituted, which is a synonym for *hoch* in
the sense of "to untie, to unfold." *Kom* means something bent, curved
or hollowed out in general, and a socket or a depression in the earth in
particular. *Kom lac* is a deep plate. In view of the context here, the
calyx of a flower seems to be meant.

<span id="fn_355"></span>[104:10](cbc15.htm#fr_357.md) Maya, *ix-ho-yal*.
*Ho* means five, and, *yal*, after a numeral, means thin layers, folds
or sheets. Literally this would mean five circles of floral leaves
composing the perianth. This seems unusual, and it is probable that five
leaves are meant.

<span id="fn_356"></span>[104:11](cbc15.htm#fr_358.md) *Ix-bac nicte*:
*ix-bac* means a little girl, and there may be a plant of that name, as
it is also a place-name. *Nicte* means flower in general, particularly
the Plumeria.

<span id="fn_357"></span>[104:12](cbc15.htm#fr_359.md) *Macuil Xochitl* is
Nahuatl for Five Flower, the Mexican god of music and dancing, probably
introduced into Yucatan by the Toltecs.

<span id="fn_358"></span>[104:13](cbc15.htm#fr_360.md) Alternative
translation: hollow tip.

<span id="fn_359"></span>[104:14](cbc15.htm#fr_361.md) *Laul*: *Stemmadenia
insignis* Miers., much admired by the Maya (Landa 1900, p. 386).

<span id="fn_360"></span>[104:15](cbc15.htm#fr_362.md) In the Maya
treatises on medical plants this word, *nicté*, always designates the
Plumeria, but here the definition found in all the Maya dictionaries has
been followed: "*Nicté*. A rose, or a flower, not indicating from what
tree, bush or plant." Motul. A secondary meaning is: "*Nicté.
Deshonestidad, vicio de carne y travezuras de mugeres*."

<span id="fn_361"></span>[105:1](cbc15.htm#fr_363.md) Possibly the
pollen-bearing insects and humming-birds are meant here. We find a
masculine prefix.

<span id="fn_362"></span>[105:2](cbc15.htm#fr_364.md) In the Tizimin and
Mani versions we find: "there was the house of the flowers."

<span id="fn_363"></span>[105:3](cbc15.htm#fr_365.md) Alternative
translation: there was no other food than this, so they say.

<span id="fn_364"></span>[105:4](cbc15.htm#fr_366.md) "Although they had a
god of song whom they called *Xocbi&lt;l&gt;tum*, they worshipped the
idol, the statue of an Indian who, they said, was a great singer and
musician named Ah Kin Xooc. They adored him as the god of poetry and
also called him Pizlimtec." Cogolludo Bk. 4, chap. 8.

<span id="fn_365"></span>[105:5](cbc15.htm#fr_367.md) Alternative
translation: to the root of the flower.

<span id="fn_366"></span>[105:6](cbc15.htm#fr_368.md) The five-petaled
flower, or *nicté*, is without doubt the Plumeria. The red Plumeria and
the white Plumeria are considered the father and mother respectively of
Nohochacyum, the head of the Lacandon Pantheon (Tozzer 1907, p. 93).

<span id="fn_367"></span>[105:7](cbc15.htm#fr_369.md) Maya, *can-hek*:
literally, four-branched.

<span id="fn_368"></span>[105:8](cbc15.htm#fr_370.md) See note
 [4](#fn_364.md).

<span id="fn_369"></span>[105:9](cbc15.htm#fr_371.md) Here the flower,
probably a Plumeria, is closely associated with the idea of carnal sin.
*Cf.* p. 104, note  [15](#fn_360.md).

<span id="fn_370"></span>[105:10](cbc15.htm#fr_372.md) "his food cries out,
his drink cries out:" here the Mani and Tizimin versions of the
narrative have been followed in the translation.

<span id="fn_371"></span>[105:11](cbc15.htm#fr_373.md) *Xau*, translated
here as claw, also means the toes of a man.

<span id="fn_372"></span>[105:12](cbc15.htm#fr_374.md) Alternative
translation: He holds in his hand a tree.

<span id="fn_373"></span>[105:13](cbc15.htm#fr_375.md) Alternative
translation: Great is his madness.

<span id="fn_374"></span>[105:14](cbc15.htm#fr_376.md) Lahun Chan: see p.
101, note  [2](#fn_321.md).

<span id="fn_375"></span>[105:15](cbc15.htm#fr_377.md) A blindfolded god is
pictured on page 50 of the Dresden Codex, and the blurred faces of the
Lords of the Katuns on page [144](cbc26.htm#page_144.md) of the Chumayel
are believed to represent the same thing.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[106:1](cbc15.htm#fr_378.md) "He seizes, he
demands as his right the mat," etc.: here the Mani and Tizimin versions
have been followed, as indicated in the Maya text.

<span id="fn_377"></span>[106:2](cbc15.htm#fr_379.md) As on page 103, we
have here another interpolation which also treats of the interrogation
of the chiefs in Katun 3 Ahau. *Cf.* [p. 89](cbc14.htm#page_89.md).

<span id="fn_378"></span>[106:3](cbc15.htm#fr_380.md) It seems likely that
the Maya compiler has inadvertently written Bolon Chan for Lahun Chan.
*Bolon* means nine, and *lahun* means ten. No personage by the name of
Bolon Chan is known to the translator, while Lahun Chan is well known.
See p. 101, note  [2](#fn_321.md).

<span id="fn_379"></span>[106:4](cbc15.htm#fr_381.md) The *than* of the
katun is translated as its "law," following the explanation on page 171
of the Kaua MS., where it is defined as "*ordenanzas*." The expression
recurs so frequently in this book that an explanation seems to be
required. Primarily than means word, speech or language, but it also has
a number of different meanings when employed figuratively. If it were
not for this definition in the same context in the Kaua MS., we should
be inclined to translate it as "the force, power and duration" of the
katun. See Motul 1930, p. 875.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[106:5](cbc15.htm#fr_382.md) "*Nun*, or *ah nun*:
A stupid foreigner who does not know the language of the country, or a
stammerer or a stutterer; also a stupid person whom it is of no use to
teach" (Motul 1930, p. 695).

<span id="fn_381"></span>[106:6](cbc15.htm#fr_383.md) Maya, *chuen*. The
translation is based on the word, *ah-chuen*, defined as artisan
(Motul).

<span id="fn_382"></span>[106:7](cbc15.htm#fr_384.md) Possible alternative
translation: Then those of the lineage of the noble chiefs shall appear.
*Cf.* [p. 92](cbc14.htm#page_92.md).

<span id="fn_383"></span>[107:1](cbc15.htm#fr_385.md) Possible alternative
translation: the conqueror of the stupid ones. *Cf.* text, p. 34, note
