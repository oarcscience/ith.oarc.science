# THE BOOK OF CHILAM BALAM OF CHUMAYEL

### INTRODUCTION

The Books of Chilam Balam are the sacred books of the Maya of Yucatan
and were named after their last and greatest prophet. *Chilam*, or
*chilan*, was his title which means that he was the mouth-piece or
interpreter of the gods. Balam means jaguar, but it is also a common
family name in Yucatan, so the title of the present work could well be
translated as the Book of the Prophet Balam.

During a large part of the colonial period, and even down into the
Nineteenth Century, many of the towns and villages of northern Yucatan
possessed Books of Chilam Balam, and this designation was supplemented
by the name of the town to which the book belonged. Thus the Book of
Chilam Balam of Chumayel is named for a village in the District of
Tekax, a short distance northwest of the well-known town of Teabo.

This Prophet Balam lived during the last decades of the Fifteenth
Century and probably the first of the Sixteenth Century <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) and foretold the coming of strangers from
the east who would establish a new religion. The prompt fulfilment of
this prediction so enhanced his reputation as a seer that in later times
he was considered the authority for many other prophecies which had been
uttered long before his time. Inasmuch as prophecies were the most
prominent feature of many of the older books of this sort, it was
natural to name them after the famous soothsayer.

The Books of Chilam Balam were written in the Maya language but in the
European script which the early missionaries adapted to express such
sounds as were not found in Spanish. Each book is a small library in
itself and contains a considerable variety of subject material. Besides
the prophecies we find brief chronicles, fragmentary historical
narratives, rituals, native catechisms, mythological accounts of the
creation of the world, almanacs and medical treatises. Many such
passages were no doubt originally transcribed from older hieroglyphic
manuscripts, some of which were still in existence in northern Yucatan
as late as the close of the Seventeenth Century <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md). As time went on, more and more European
material was added to the native Maya lore. In some of the books not
only do we find the ritual of a religion which is a

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

mixture of the old faith with Christianity, but there are also
translations into Maya of Spanish religious tracts and astrological
treatises, as well as notes of events which occurred during the colonial
period. In two of these books we even find part of a Spanish romance
translated into Maya. <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md)

The ability of the Maya to write their own language in European script
was due to the educational policy of the Spanish missionaries. Although
at first they rather admired the Maya for having a graphic system of
their own, they were determined to destroy the old manuscripts and
eradicate all knowledge of the glyphs from the minds of their converts.
The Indians had a great reverence for their hieroglyphic writing which
was permeated with the symbols of their old religion, and the friars
felt that if they could wipe out this knowledge and substitute for it
the European system of writing, it would be an effective means for the
complete Christianization of the native population. This should be the
easier, since the knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was confined to the
priesthood and certain members of the nobility. Diego de Landa,
afterward bishop of Yucatan, burned twenty-seven hieroglyphic
manuscripts at the famous *auto de fe* in Mani in 1562, and although
many of the Spaniards severely criticized him for this, there is little
doubt that other missionaries followed his example whenever they had the
opportunity.

The chiefs and former priests were ordered to send their sons to the
schools established by the Franciscan friars, where they were taught to
read and write their own language in European letters. Although some of
the more promising pupils were taught Spanish, there does not seem to
have been any general policy of attempting to impose the language of the
conquerors upon the Indians. In the first place such a scheme was
plainly impracticable owing to the comparatively small number of
Spaniards in Yucatan and, besides, many of the missionaries frankly
admitted that they preferred the local officials of the villages in
their charge not to know Spanish. <span id="fr_3"></span>[2](#fn_3.md) This
was probably in order that the latter should not complain too frequently
of ecclesiastical discipline to the lay officials, who were sometimes at
odds with the Franciscans. From a purely educational point of view the
schools were a success, for after a time every village had its town
clerk who could read and write, as well as many members of the more
important native families; but the Spanish settlers complained in the
latter part of the Sixteenth Century that many native schoolmasters and
choir-masters were still practising idolatry in secret and that idols
had even been found in the school-houses. <span
id="fr_4"></span>[3](#fn_4.md)

If such persons as these were not completely reformed, it is hardly
surprising to find the successors of the former prophets and priests,
the herb-doctors and sorcerers of colonial times, making use of this new
and more convenient graphic system of the white man in the pursuit of
their ancient

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

professions. After Landa's famous bonfire at Mani, it is needless to say
that the surviving hieroglyphic manuscripts were kept concealed,
although now and then one of them came to the notice of the Franciscans.
Seventy years after the Conquest, Aguilar wrote that "in these they
painted in colors the count of their years, the wars, epidemics,
hurricanes inundations, famines and other events." <span
id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) It is remarkable that not a single one of
these books is known to have survived in Yucatan at the present time,
for as late as the close of the Seventeenth Century Avendaño was quite
familiar with them. In his account of the visit he made to the heathen
Itzá at Tayasal he writes: "At the instant that we landed and I saw the
said column and mask, <span id="fr_6"></span>[2](#fn_6.md) I came to
recognize it since I had already read about it in their old papers and
had seen it in their *Anahtés*, which they use, which are books of barks
of trees, polished and covered with lime, in which by painted figures
and characters they have foretold their future events." <span
id="fr_7"></span>[3](#fn_7.md) This was Avendaño's first visit to any of
the heathen Maya, and he could only have seen such hieroglyphic books as
still survived in northern Yucatan.

A comparison of these descriptions with the existing Books of Chilam
Balam shows plainly that many portions of the latter are simply
transcriptions of the old hieroglyphic manuscripts into European script.
Aguilar mentions one of these early transcriptions which was written in
a copy-book and contained an account of the creation of the world. He
confiscated this book from a choir-master of the town of Sucopo. <span
id="fr_8"></span>[4](#fn_8.md) As time went on, the transcriptions
gradually took the place of the older hieroglyphic books. Fewer people
were now able to read the glyphs, and much as the clergy condemned the
Books of Chilam Balam, they were not considered such prima facie
evidence of the crime of idolatry as was anything written in
hieroglyphics. Aguilar also tells us how in their assemblies the Indians
read the fables and histories contained in the books. Some of the
contents were chanted to the accompaniment of a drum; old songs were
sung; <span id="fr_9"></span>[5](#fn_9.md) and the dramatic
representations, the names of which we find listed in the Motul
dictionary, were enacted. <span id="fr_10"></span>[6](#fn_10.md) Cogolludo
later wrote of such meetings that "God knows what goes on there, and at
the very least many of them end up in drunkenness." <span
id="fr_11"></span>[7](#fn_11.md)

None of the Books of Chilam Balam that have come down to us were
compiled earlier than the last part of the Seventeenth Century, and most
of them date from the Eighteenth Century. The older ones were probably
worn out by constant use. Nevertheless we have Maya legal documents
covering almost

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

every decade from the year 1557 down to the present time, and a
comparison of the language of these with that of the Books of Chilam
Balam shows that many passages of the latter were copied verbatim from
Sixteenth and early Seventeenth Century originals.

At the present time we have photographic reproductions of the Books of
Chilam Balam of Chumayel, Tizimin, Kaua, Ixil, Tekax and Nah as well as
copious extracts copied from the Mani and Oxkutzcab manuscripts. The
latter were made by Dr. Hermann Berendt and are now in the Berendt
Linguistic Collection of the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania.
This scholar also made copies of the Chumayel and Tizimin manuscripts
about sixty years ago, when they were in better condition than when the
present photographs were made. Consequently a complete transcription and
translation of the texts can only be made with the aid of these copies.
Tozzer gives the names of four others known by reputation only: the
Books of Chilam Balam of Nabula, Tihosuco, Tixcocob and Hocabá. <span
id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md) Genet and Chelbatz give a brief
description of a Book of Chilam Balam of Telchac. <span
id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md)

Of these books the Chumayel, Tizimin and Mani manuscripts have the
greatest value for the study of Maya civilization, although the others
are not lacking in interest. The Chumayel was a small quarto volume
which appears to have originally consisted of fifty-eight numbered
leaves. There are only 107 written pages in the University of
Pennsylvania reproduction. Three leaves, numbers 1, 50 and 55, are
missing, and there are breaks in the text at these places. The other
pages seem to have been blank. The writer has seen only the leather
cover, in which a hole had been burned; the book itself had disappeared.
A number of the leaves are either torn or have crumbled away along the
edges, and some of the pages are badly water-stained in places.
Nevertheless the manuscript is very legible on the whole. Although it
dates only from the year 1782, the language suggests the Seventeenth
Century much more than it does the Eighteenth. The book contains
comparatively little of the intrusive European material which
predominates in other Books of Chilam Balam written at so late a date.
The drawings which illustrate the volume are quite European in
character, although many of the ideas which they represent are purely
Maya.

Brinton was the first to make a translation of any considerable portion
of the Chumayel. Using the Berendt copy of the text, he translated the
three chronicles found in Chapters XIX, XX and XXI of the present
work. <span id="fr_14"></span>[3](#fn_14.md) Martinez Hernandez has
published his own Spanish translations of these chronicles, also the
story of the Last Judgment in Chapter XXIII and the first part of the
creation narrative in Chapter X. <span id="fr_15"></span>[4](#fn_15.md)
Tozzer has translated the prophecy of Chilam Balam in Chapter XXIV and
the chronicle in Chapter XX. <span id="fr_16"></span>[5](#fn_16.md) The
writer

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

has published translations of Chapters II, IX and XIII, <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) and the entire manuscript has been freely
rendered into Spanish poetical prose by Mediz Bolio. <span
id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md)

We know from internal evidence that the Chilam Balam of Chumayel was
compiled by Don Juan Josef Hoil of that town, as we find his name signed
to a notation written in the same hand as the rest of the book and dated
1782. <span id="fr_19"></span>[3](#fn_19.md) Only a few interpolations
added at later dates are written in different hands. Subsequently the
book passed into the possession either of a certain unnamed priest or of
his secretary, Justo Balam, who inscribed two baptismal records on one
of the blank pages in 1832 and 1833. <span id="fr_20"></span>[4](#fn_20.md)
In 1838 Pedro de Alcantara Briceño of San Antonio made a record on the
same page that he had purchased the book "in his poverty" for the price
of one peso, probably from a priest, although the writing is very
indistinct. It is possible that the priest was Don Diego Hoil, the son
of the writer. On another blank page <span id="fr_21"></span>[5](#fn_21.md)
the same Pedro Briceño noted that he made a loan of the book. The date
here is badly written, but it is probably 1858. Some time during the
next ten years it was acquired by Don Audomaro Molina, how or where, we
do not know; but the latter stated to Sr. Martinez Hernandez in
1910 <span id="fr_22"></span>[6](#fn_22.md) that he had given it to Bishop
Crescencio Carrillo y Ancona. It was already in the Bishop's possession
when Dr. Berendt copied it in 1868, and he permitted Teobert Maler to
make the first photographs of it in 1887. When Bishop Carrillo died in
1897, the book passed into the hands of Don Ricardo Figueroa, and
through the efforts of Sr. Molina it was loaned in 1910 to George B.
Gordon, Director of the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, who
photographed it the same year. In 1913 the Museum published & handsome
facsimile reproduction from which the present translation is made. The
original was returned to Figueroa, in whose house Dr. S. G. Morley saw
it in 1913. After Figueroa's death the manuscript was removed in 1915 to
the Cepeda Library in Merida, but when Dr. Morley visited the Library in
1918 it had disappeared and its whereabouts is still unknown. As Dr.
Morley has already noted, "In view of its doubtful fate, it is nothing
short of providential that two photographic copies of it exist, the one
made by Maler in 1887, a copy of which is in the Gates collection, and
the other made by Gordon in 1910." <span id="fr_23"></span>[7](#fn_23.md)

The attempt has been made to learn something about Don Juan Josef Hoil,
the compiler of the manuscript, from the surviving members of the Hoil
family of Chumayel, and although he has not been completely identified,
the results of the inquiry are not without interest. The writer is
indebted to Sr. Martinez Hernandez of Merida for the following
information.

There appears to have been but one Hoil family in Chumayel. The present
generation consists of Miguel, care-taker at Uxmal; Alejandro, a
brakeman on

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

the Ferrocarriles Unidos de Yucatan; Transito and Valentina, all of whom
were born at the village of Xul. After much consultation with the
various members of the family, Miguel Hoil reported on February 28,
1928, that their father was Epitacio Hoil, who married Cristina Parra
and had a brother, Maximo. The grandfather was Juan José Hoil, married
to Felipa Mendoza. He could hardly be the Don Juan Josef Hoil who signed
the manuscript in 1782, however. The great-grandfather was Damaso Hoil,
the natural son of a Doña Guadelupe Hoil, and married to Narcisa Guemes.
From his time down to that of Epitacio the family seems to have lived at
Tekax. Doña Guadelupe was the sister of Don Diego Hoil, curate of San
Cristóbal. This is a suburb of Merida and was an important Indian
parish, which indicates that Don Diego was a man of some learning and
considerable importance. This would take us back to about the time when
the manuscript was written, but unfortunately our information ceases at
this point. It seems likely that the Don Juan Josef Hoil who wrote the
Chilam Balam of Chumayel was the father of Don Diego, the curate, and of
Doña Guadelupe. A search of the records of the parish of San Cristóbal
might be rewarded with the confirmation of Don Diego's parentage. If
Doña Guadelupe's natural son, Damaso, was brought up in her father's
home at Chumayel, it would be most natural that Damaso should give his
own son the name of his maternal grandfather.

As to the manuscript itself, the most probable conclusion from the
information which we have is that after Don Juan Josef Hoil's death it
passed into the hands of Don Diego and that he was the priest who sold
the book to Diego Briceño in 1838.

Needless to say, the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel is difficult to
translate, although the spelling is better on the whole than that of
some of the other manuscripts. As Professor Tozzer has noted, many words
are separated arbitrarily into syllables, the same word sometimes being
divided in several different ways on the same page. <span
id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md) Some passages are logically arranged in
paragraphs, which is a great help, but many are not. There is little
division of the text into sentences, and a capital letter rarely begins
either a sentence or a proper name. Consequently it is necessary to
establish a critical text before attempting a formal translation.

The greatest difficulty of all is found in the numerous obsolete words
and phrases which occur. It has already been noted that the Chumayel is
a compilation made from various earlier works, many of which were
probably copied from still older books. This would account for an
occasional corrupt text, which can often be rectified from parallel
passages or similar stereotyped phrases occurring in the other writings.
The meaning of obsolete words and phrases can be learned in three ways.
They may be found in the older dictionaries which were written at a time
when they were still in use; a more

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

modern Maya expression or even a Spanish word is sometimes substituted
in a parallel passage in another manuscript; and when other means fail,
the use of the same word or expression in a number of different contexts
will cast considerable light upon the meaning. Sometimes the Maya writer
of a manuscript will even explain the significance of an obscure term
which he thinks his readers might not understand. For an explanation of
the many proper names found in the Chumayel, especially those of
deities, we are obliged to rely largely on the Spanish source material
such as Landa, the Relaciones de Yucatan, Cogolludo, Aguilar and Lizana.
This information may be supplemented by the reports of such modern
ethnological investigators as Tozzer, Redfield, Thompson and Gann. Many
unfamiliar words not found in any Maya dictionary have turned out to be
plant-names. These will be found in the Maya medical literature, and a
great many of them have been identified by the botanists. <span
id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md)

It has been suggested that a modern Maya Indian should be of great
assistance in translating these old books, but none of the few efforts
which have been made along this line of inquiry have had much success.
The vocabulary of the average Indian is limited. Many words are now used
with a changed meaning, and he is entirely too ready to resort to a
typical *Volksetymologie* to explain any word which has now passed out
of current use. This is evident from the explanations made by natives to
the botanists in the case of plant-names composed of obsolete words. The
errors of such native derivations are amply demonstrated by the
Sixteenth Century Motul dictionary, in which many of these old words are
found. Up to the present a little has been done in this respect with the
native Maya priests, or *h-menob*, some of whom can still recite a
number of the old incantations. Such men would be likely to rely more on
tradition than on their own improvised etymology. Dr. Redfield's
elucidation of the puzzling name of Ah Muzencab, the bee-god, from the
explanation of one of these native sorcerers is an example of the
results which may be looked for from this line of inquiry. Needless to
say, it is difficult to persuade these native priests to explain their
rituals.

Doubts have been expressed in the past as to whether it was possible to
translate some of the passages in the Book of Chilam Balam. of Chumayel.
Such scepticism was not unreasonable in view of the limited amount of
related material accessible to the student at the time. In more recent
years, however, additional manuscripts have been collected, and
photographs or photostats have been made of nearly all the Maya writings
known to be in existence. The archæological evidence uncovered in the
course of the past few years and the reports of modern ethnologists have
furnished explanations for a number of the obscure statements found in
the Books of Chilam Balam. In view of these facts a translation of these
books seems feasible at the present time; but there is little doubt that
further search among the archives of Spain

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

will bring to light additional reports on the natives of Yucatan,
possibly some of the lost source material known to have been written by
the early Spanish missionaries. Also the discovery of more Maya
manuscripts and the results of further archæological and ethnological
investigations should furnish an answer to many of the problems as yet
unsolved. Another source of information should be the thorough study of
the more closely related languages of the Maya stock. It seems likely
that at least some of the obsolete words in the Books of Chilam Balam
will be more fully explained by similar terms which have survived in the
other languages.

### PREFATORY NOTE TO THE MAYA TEXT

Like the other Books of Chilam Balam, the Chumayel manuscript is written
in the European script which the Sixteenth Century Spanish missionaries
adapted to the Maya language of Yucatan. It differs only in a few
particulars from ordinary Spanish script. The letters d, f, g, q and r
are not employed in writing Maya words, as the sounds which they
represent do not occur in Maya. Some Maya writers substituted ij for ii,
but neither the Spanish nor the English sound of j appears to be
indicated. C is pronounced somewhat like the English k. The other
letters have approximately the same sound as in Spanish except for the
following, which represent sounds which do not occur in Spanish, viz.
pp, th, ɔ, ch and k. The writer is indebted to Dr. M. J. Andrade for the
following description:

"These sounds are very familiar to those who have studied the Indian
languages of North America, where they are at present represented
respectively by the phonetic symbols p', t', ts', tc' and k'. They are
the so-called glottalized or fortis sounds. It is difficult to convey an
idea of the acoustic effect of these sounds to those who have never
heard them. Roughly speaking, it may be said that Maya pp and th are
emphatic articulations of Maya p and t, and that a similar
correspondence exists between the series ɔ, ch, k, and tz, ch, c. A
careful enunciation of the k-sound, however, does not affect our ears as
a mere emphatic articulation of the Maya c, but that is also the case in
other Indian languages in which this sound occurs. In Maya these fortis
sounds are not articulated as energetically as in many North American
languages, particularly in those of the Pacific coast. On the whole they
may best be compared with the corresponding sounds of the Dakota Sioux,
although with many Maya speakers they are so weak that the untrained ear
can not distinguish them from the unemphatic sounds." <span
id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md)

In writing the double vowels, Maya writers are frequently inconsistent,
although the compiler of the Chumayel is less so than most of them. They
sometimes write them with a single vowel. Of these Dr. Andrade states
that the sound is--

"two moras long with a fall in pitch on the second half if it is a
double vowel. In current usage there is no articulation of two separate
vowels, but a continuous vocalic sound. This throws light, I think, on
the discrepancy found in the manuscripts. If

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

this phoneme was even in earlier times a single vocalic sound with
double quantity, we can readily see that the use of two letters for its
orthography was somewhat artificial, and in this, as in all artificial
spelling, individuals are more likely to make mistakes."

We find in the use of certain letters an inconsistency that is somewhat
similar to that found in many of the Spanish manuscripts of the colonial
period. Since a consistent notation is desirable in the present edition
of the Maya text, the writer has followed that of Pio Perez for which
there is precedent among both Maya writers and the Spanish authors of
Maya grammars, vocabularies and dictionaries. It is the notation of
Beltran, except that he writes p for pp, and of the Motul dictionary,
except for the latter's frequent use of ç instead of z. The following
tabulation will explain the present writer's method of avoiding the
inconsistencies which occur in most Maya manuscripts.

Only one abbreviation is generally used in the Maya manuscripts: this is
the character <u>y</u>, which stands for *yetel*, a word having the
double meaning of "with" and "and." A few manuscripts, chiefly legal
documents, substitute for this another abbreviation, <u>y</u>t, and only
rarely is the word *yetel* written out in full. In the present rendition
of the Maya text the writer has followed Brinton's example and
transcribed this abbreviation just as it is found in the Chumayel
manuscript instead of writing out the word in full.

The text of the Books of Chilam Balam is not divided into sentences, and
many portions are not separated into paragraphs. Words are frequently
wrongly divided into syllables, and proper names rarely begin with
capital letters. Inasmuch as an excellent photographic reproduction of
the original manuscript of the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel has been
published by the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania and is
accessible to the student, it has been considered advisable in the
present edition to divide the Maya text into such chapters, paragraphs,
sentences and words as are called for by the meaning of the
subject-matter, and to begin sentences and proper names with capital
letters. The method of determining which words are proper names has been
discussed elsewhere. The text is often divided into short phrases by
colons or dashes. Such punctuation is sometimes inconsistent and even
occurs in the middle of a proper name, but it frequently corresponds
somewhat to the meaning of the text. For this peculiar system of
punctuation, the Maya student is referred to the published reproduction
of the manuscript.

We now come to the mistakes found in the manuscript. Juan Josef Hoil was
on the whole an unusually careful copyist, and the writer is inclined to

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

ascribe most of the errors to his sources. As Professor Tozzer has
already noted, <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md) these texts are
probably copies of copies and have been garbled somewhat in passing from
hand to hand. In the Chumayel manuscript a garbled phrase is often
accompanied by a vacant space, indicating that the copyist was not able
to read all the words of his source at that point. In these cases it is
often possible to correct the text from a parallel passage in another
manuscript. In the case of such a correction, however, the reader is
referred to a foot-note in which the corrected word or phrase is given
as it is actually written in the manuscript. Sometimes a passage is
obscure because of the omission of a word or phrase. When the latter is
supplied from another source, it is enclosed in diamond brackets and its
source indicated in a foot-note. In some cases where a parallel passage
radically alters the meaning of the text, the alternative reading is
given in a foot-note.

In transcribing the photographic reproduction of this lost manuscript,
the Berendt copy of the original has been used constantly for
comparison. This has been especially helpful in deciphering badly
written and faded portions of the text, and is indispensable where the
edge of a page has crumbled away after the Berendt copy was made.
Missing words supplied from this copy are placed in diamond brackets,
and the source is indicated in a foot-note.

Misspelled words constitute another difficulty. Many errors are due to a
habit of the Maya writer who often employs the letter ç for z and then
occasionally omits the cedilla. Such an omission may completely change
the meaning of the word. Another error sometimes found is when the Maya
writer has omitted the bar from the p (pp) and ch. Often these mistakes
in orthography can be corrected from a parallel passage, but
occasionally the meaning of the context must be depended upon in the
case of an obvious mistake or a slip of the pen. Corrections of
orthography are referred to a foot-note in which the word is given as it
stands in the manuscript.

It is needless to say that a critical text can be established with much
more assurance for those portions of the Book of Chilam Balam of
Chumayel for which parallel passages can be found in other manuscripts.
Such corresponding passages are not absolutely the same. The phraseology
differs slightly. Some contain a certain amount of material omitted by
others, and an archaic word or phrase in one may be replaced in another
by a more modern expression or sometimes even by a Spanish word.
Nevertheless the language is sufficiently similar to indicate that they
are drawn from a single original source.

Where the Chumayel narrative is not duplicated elsewhere, we are
frequently aided by comparison with other texts of the same general
character. This is because the Books of Chilam Balam abound in certain
stereotyped phrases often employed in similar contexts. When a portion
of such a phrase appears to be garbled and we find the same phrase
occurring elsewhere in

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

much the same context, we can make the correction with a fair degree of
certainty. In any case the garbled phrase will be found in the
foot-note, and the reader is at liberty to draw his own conclusions.

As previously stated, all supplied material is enclosed in diamond
brackets &lt; &gt;. Any words or letters believed by the writer to be
intrusive are enclosed in square brackets \[ \].

Certain abbreviations have been employed in the notes to the Maya text.
These are to be explained as follows:

Ber. = Copy of the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel by Dr. Hermann

In the present rendition of the Maya text it will be seen that marginal
notations have been made showing the corresponding page numbers of the
University of Pennsylvania Museum reproduction of the manuscript.
Inasmuch as some of the earlier commentaries on the Book of Chilam.
Balam of Chumayel make references to the actual folio numbers of the
manuscript, a correlation of these with the page numbers of the
reproduction will be useful. Some of the folio numbers have disappeared,
owing to the crumbling away of the corner of the sheet, but the sequence
of the text enables us to apply them in the following table.
