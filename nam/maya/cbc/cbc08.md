### (A PROPHECY FOR KATUN 11 AHAU) <span id="fr_161"></span>[3](#fn_160)

Katun 11 Ahau is set upon the mat, set upon the throne, when their ruler
is set up. Yaxal Chac <span id="fr_162"></span>[4](#fn_161) is its face
to their ruler. The heavenly fan, the heavenly wreath and the heavenly
bouquet shall descend. <span id="fr_163"></span>[5](#fn_162) The drum
and rattle of the lord of 11 Ahau shall resound, when flint knives are
set into his mantle. <span id="fr_164"></span>[6](#fn_163) At that time
there shall be the green turkey; at that time there shall be Zulim Chan;
at that time there shall be Chakanputun. <span
id="fr_165"></span>[7](#fn_164) They shall find their food among the
trees; they shall find their food among the rocks, those who have lost
their &lt;usual&gt; food <span id="fr_166"></span>[8](#fn_165) in katun
11 Ahau.

11 Ahau is the beginning of the count, because this was the katun when
the foreigners arrived. They came from the east when they arrived. Then

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Christianity also began. The fulfilment of its
prophecy is &lt;ascribed&gt; to the east. <span
id="fr_167"></span>[1](#fn_166) The katun is established at
Ichcaanzihoo. <span id="fr_168"></span>[2](#fn_167)

This is a record of the things which they did. After it had all passed,
they told of it in their &lt;own&gt; words, but its meaning is not
plain. Still the course of events was as it is written. But even when
everything shall be thoroughly

explained, perhaps not so much is written about it, nor has very much
been written of the guilt of their conspiracies with one another. So it
was with the ruler of the Itzá, with the men &lt;who were rulers&gt; of
Izamal, Ake, Uxmal, Ichcanziho &lt;and&gt; Citab Couoh <span
id="fr_169"></span>[3](#fn_168) also. Very many were the /

head-chiefs and many a conspiracy they made with one another. But they
are not made known in what is &lt;written&gt; here; not so much will be
related. Still he who comes of our lineage will know it, one of us who
are Maya men. He will know how to explain these things when he reads
what is here. When he sees it, then he will explain the adjustment of
the intricacy of the katun by our priest, Ah Kin Xuluc; but Xuluc <span
id="fr_170"></span>[4](#fn_169) was not his name formerly. It was only
because these

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

priests of ours were to come to an end when misery was introduced, when
Christianity was introduced by the real Christians. Then with the true
God, the true *Dios*, came the beginning of our misery. It was the
beginning of tribute, the beginning of church dues, <span
id="fr_171"></span>[1](#fn_170) the beginning of strife with
purse-snatching, <span id="fr_172"></span>[2](#fn_171) the beginning of
strife with blow-guns, the beginning of strife by trampling on people,
the beginning of robbery with violence, the beginning of forced debts,
the beginning of debts enforced by false testimony, the beginning of
individual strife, a beginning of vexation, a beginning of robbery with
violence. <span id="fr_173"></span>[3](#fn_172) This was the origin of
service to the Spaniards and priests, of service to the local
chiefs, <span id="fr_174"></span>[4](#fn_173) of service to the
teachers, <span id="fr_175"></span>[5](#fn_174) of service to the public
prosecutors by the boys, the youths of the town, while the poor people
were harassed. These were the very poor people who did not depart when
oppression was /

put upon them. It was by Antichrist <span
id="fr_176"></span>[6](#fn_175) on earth, the kinkajous of the towns,
the foxes of the towns, <span id="fr_177"></span>[7](#fn_176) the
blood-sucking insects of the town, those who drained the poverty of the
working people. But it shall still come to pass that tears shall come to
the eyes of our Lord God. The justice of our Lord God shall descend upon
every part of the world, straight from God upon Ah Kantenal, Ix Pucyola,
the avaricious hagglers <span id="fr_178"></span>[8](#fn_177) of the
world.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_160"></span>[77:3](cbc08.htm#fr_161) A discussion of Maya
prophecies will be found in Appendix D.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[77:4](cbc08.htm#fr_162) Literally, the green
rain-god. Rain is green in the Maya picture-manuscripts. *Cf.* Appendix
A.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[77:5](cbc08.htm#fr_163) In the Mani version of
this prophecy these objects are said to be held in the hand of Yaxal
Chac (Perez Codex, p. 75). We are told that the Maya "were fond of
fragrant odors, and so made use of bouquets of flowers and fragrant
herbs of odd designs." The bouquet was also a ceremonial object, for
when children were baptised, the priest's assistant carried a bouquet of
flowers. With this he made a threatening motion nine times at each child
and then caused the child to smell it (Landa 1928, pp. 150 and 184).

<span id="fn_163"></span>[77:6](cbc08.htm#fr_164) Here the text is
corrupt, it is corrected from page [133](cbc23.htm#page_133).

<span id="fn_164"></span>[77:7](cbc08.htm#fr_165) The green turkey ([p.
70](cbc07.htm#page_70)), Zulim Chan ([p. 69](cbc07.htm#page_69)) and
Chakanputun ([p. 136](cbc24.htm#page_136)) are all associated with
occasions when people were driven out into the forest, as many were in
Katun 11 Ahau, the period of the Spanish conquest.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[77:8](cbc08.htm#fr_166) Alternative
translation: who have lost their sowed fields, etc.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[78:1](cbc08.htm#fr_167) Compare with the
katun-wheel on [p. 132](cbc23.htm#page_132).

<span id="fn_167"></span>[78:2](cbc08.htm#fr_168) This is the end of the
prophecy. What follows is a commentary.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[78:3](cbc08.htm#fr_169) The Couoh (Spider)
family ruled in Champoton (Landa 1928, p. 42).

<span id="fn_169"></span>[78:4](cbc08.htm#fr_170) Xuluc is probably
derived from the name of a fish resembling the dace, but it can also
mean perishable, hence the play on words here.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[79:1](cbc08.htm#fr_171) *Limosna* in the text,
but to the Indians it meant compulsory dues.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[79:2](cbc08.htm#fr_172) Lit. snatching the
bags in which they carried the cacao used for small change.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[79:3](cbc08.htm#fr_173) These are stereotyped
phrases usually employed to describe a riot or the plundering of a town.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[79:4](cbc08.htm#fr_174) Here we have a
description of the oppression of the Indians during the colonial period,
not only by the Spaniards but also by many of their own chiefs who held
public office under the Spanish regime.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[79:5](cbc08.htm#fr_175) Maya, *camzah*, is a
term also supplied to the village choirmaster, a person of considerable
authority.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[79:6](cbc08.htm#fr_176) Called *antachristoil*
in the text. We suspect it merely means bad Christians here.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[79:7](cbc08.htm#fr_177) These are terms
applied in general to harsh and oppressive Maya chiefs. It is probable
that they were originally honorable titles among the Itzá. *Cf.*
Appendix F.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[79:8](cbc08.htm#fr_178) Maya, ¢utanil, which
the Pio Perez dictionary translates as sorcerers or witches. The
alternative translation, derived from ¢*ut* seems preferable here.
