At that time he went to Tzimentan,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_533"></A><A HREF="#fn_531"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> and when he was at Tzimentan a certain queen said she would marry him. For seven years he was married, when the golden doors of the house of four apartments&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_534"></A><A HREF="#fn_532"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> were opened. &lt;Here&gt;he was shown how, and he equipped&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_535"></A><A HREF="#fn_533"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> a fleet of thirteen ships.

It was three months &lt;ago&gt; that you arrived, since you arrived, since you are shut up in the prison; in the meantime I come. I will take you out of prison.

<P>"Let nine chairs be raised up for us to sit on.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_538"></A><A HREF="#fn_536"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The sea shall burn. I shall be raised up." There was fire in his eye.

Whereupon the captain accoutered himself. &lt;Everything&gt; shall be blown to the ground by the wind. In the meantime I sit on my chair; in the meantime the fleet of thirteen ships comes. Then the King&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_539"></A><A HREF="#fn_537"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> accouters himself also. "Prepare yourself, my lord! There come the French." These were his words to me. "We shall be killed by &lt;these&gt; men. For what reason does your strength fail because of your compatriots? Let me go and direct the ship from the middle." My own spirits are raised also. The sea upon which I go burns. The face of the heavens is tilted.

<P>Now the town officials went elsewhere.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_547"></A><A HREF="#fn_545"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> Whereupon he said he would give his town, half of the men &lt;in it&gt;, to me.

<P><A NAME="fn_492"></A><A HREF="cbc20.htm#fr_494">120:4</A> The following combined prophecy and narrative in the Chumayel is immediately joined to and made a part of the chronicle contained in the previous chapter, following the statement that a certain epidemic occurred in the year 1692.</P>
<P>Two parallel versions of the material contained in the present chapter are found in the Tizimin (pp. 14-16) and Mani (pp. 109-116) manuscripts. The fullest account is that of the Mani, but the Tizimin version is probably the oldest, as it retains the Maya forms of a number of words which are translated into Spanish in the Mani and Chumayel. Both the Tizimin and Mani versions contain an explanatory introduction which is completely lacking in the Chumayel.</P>
<P>The Mani version bears the following title: <I>U than hahal ku tu nathob Chilam</I>, which could be translated: The words of the true God which Chilam understood. The introduction states that the other great Maya prophets (see Appendix D) assembled at the house of Chilam Balam, here also called Ah Nacom Balam and indicating that he was the official sacrificial priest (Landa 1928, p. 194). Chilam Balam lay stretched out in a trance in his room, while he received a revelation which seems to have descended from the roof of the house, and which only he understood. Finally all the others threw themselves on their faces, and Chilam Balam is said to have delivered the prophecy contained in this chapter.</P>
<P>In this prophecy we find inserted bodily the story of a certain Antonio Martinez, an adventurer who <A HREF="errata.htm#1">probably</A> lived long after the Spanish Conquest. His name does not appear in any of the Spanish histories of Yucatan. A portion of the actual prophecy evidently dates from ancient times and is written in very obscure language, while other passages are inspired by events which occurred after the Spanish occupation.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_493"></A><A HREF="cbc20.htm#fr_495">120:5</A> Supplied from the Tizimin and Mani version of this prophecy.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_494"></A><A HREF="cbc20.htm#fr_496">120:6</A> In the Tizimin and Mani versions it is called "the first katun." Katun 11 Ahau is usually called the first katun. (<I>Cf.</I> <A HREF="cbc27.htm#page_147">p. 147</A>.) Not only was it the first katun of the Spanish occupation, but it also began with the day 1 Imix which was the first day of the tzol-kin, or tonalamatl. Possibly it is here called the tenth katun because the Eighteenth Century Maya copyist found it recorded immediately after the date 1692. According to several Eighteenth Century Maya writers a Katun 10 Ahau should have ended in 1692, but their deduction is not supported by the historical evidence (Tizimin, p. 1; Mani, p. 135; cf. Seler 1902, pp. 591-592).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_495"></A><A HREF="cbc20.htm#fr_497">121:1</A> The erotic significance of the Plumeria flower has already been discussed (p. 104, note &nbsp;<A HREF="cbc15.htm#fn_360"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A>). But that this eroticism was always sinful may be doubted, for it was associated with lawful marriage and with the father and mother of Nohochacyum, the head of the Lacandon Pantheon. Furthermore the corollas of this flower are strung in chains and still used as decorations in churches, a custom which probably dates from ancient times (Standley 1930, p. 384). Consequently it may be inferred that many of its associations were innocent and simply concerned the reproduction of the race. Nevertheless, it may have been associated with Kukulcan because of the introduction of certain erotic religious practises by the Toltecs, and with the coming of the Spaniards on account of the manner in which European soldiers of the Sixteenth Century usually behaved toward the women of a newly conquered population. Maya warriors probably carried off women captives to make slaves and concubines of them, but it is doubtful that they practised violation in warfare. Compare with the prophecy for Katun 7 Ahau, <A HREF="cbc27.htm#page_151">p. 151</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_496"></A><A HREF="cbc20.htm#fr_498">121:2</A> Maya <I>uu</I>. This refers to an actual lunation, and not to the Maya month of 20 days which was called <I>uinal</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_497"></A><A HREF="cbc20.htm#fr_499">121:3</A> This name is not Maya. The division made here is in accordance with the Maya texts. Its usual association with the quetzal leads to the conclusion that it is closely connected with Kukulcan and may be another name for the Mexican culture-hero.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_498"></A><A HREF="cbc20.htm#fr_500">121:4</A> The quetzal, the green bird, Maya <I>kuk yaxum</I>. For <I>yaxum</I> see p. 63, note &nbsp;<A HREF="cbc06.htm#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. <I>Kuk</I> usually means a sprout or shoot, hence offspring or descendants (Motul). Here we believe it refers to the quetzal, which is also called <I>k&ugrave;k</I> in Kekchi and <I>xman k'uk</I> in Chol (Sapper 1927, p. 428). The Maya word for feather is <I>kukum</I>; but it is very possible that the name, Kukul-can, is derived directly from <I>kuk</I>, quetzal, and <I>can</I>, serpent, making it a literal translation of the Nahuatl Quetzalcoatl.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_499"></A><A HREF="cbc20.htm#fr_501">121:5</A> The translator can make little out of the Maya expression found here in the Chumayel, <I>u may chiiceh</I>. <I>May</I> can mean either hoof or a fine powder, and <I>chiich</I> means forcefully. The variant found in the Mani version of this passage, <I>ah chich</I> is quite intelligible and means "the forceful one."</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_501"></A><A HREF="cbc20.htm#fr_503">121:7</A> If some of the most powerful families of Yucatan, like the Xius, were of foreign origin, they would have penances and other religious practises not understood by the ordinary people. <I>Cf.</I> Appendix E.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_503"></A><A HREF="cbc20.htm#fr_505">121:9</A> The various Maya compilers of the Books of Chilam Balam appear to have been uncertain about this passage. The Chumayel text reads <I>&#162;u&#162;ul</I> which means withered or shriveled; the Mani version gives <I>thul</I> which could be translated: "like a rabbit;" while the Tizimin variant is <I>tzutzui</I> which means dove. Among the Mexicans Quetzalcoatl was pictured as having a face not altogether human.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_504"></A><A HREF="cbc20.htm#fr_506">121:10</A> The Tizimin version is "disgusting is his body."</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_550"></A><A HREF="cbc20.htm#fr_552">125:2</A> Katun 9 Ahau covered approximately the seventh and eighth decades of the Sixteenth Century. By this time most of the thickly settled portions of the country had been pacified. Many people who had fled to the forests to escape the violence of the Spanish conquerors now returned to their homes again. The Spanish Governor at Merida seriously undertook to reconstruct the social and political organization of the country which had been disrupted by the Conquest. Much of this work was begun during Katun 11 Ahau, but it was probably Katun 9 Ahau before results began to be noted generally.</P>
