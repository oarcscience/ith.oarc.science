### (PROPHECIES OF A NEW RELIGION) <span id="fr_875"></span>[2](#fn_869)

These are the words which were composed to admonish the fatherless ones,
the motherless ones. <span id="fr_876"></span>[3](#fn_870) These words
are to be treasured as a precious jewel is treasured. They are
concerning the coming introduction of Christianity, &lt;and were
spoken&gt; at Tancah Mayapan &lt;and&gt; at Chichen Itzá in the time of
the Zuyua people, <span id="fr_877"></span>[4](#fn_871) in the time of
the Itzá. A new wisdom shall dawn upon the world <span
id="fr_878"></span>[5](#fn_872) universally, in the east, north, west
and south. It shall come from the mouth of God the Father. Those who
recorded it were the five priests, the holy priests who came into the
presence of God. They recorded the charge of misfortune when the
introduction of Christianity came.

Here are their names written down:

1\. Chilam Balam, the great priest.  
2. Napuctun, the great priest.  
3. Nahau Pech, the great priest.  
4. Ah Kuil Chel, the great priest.  
5. Natzin Yabun Chan, the great priest.

&lt;Like&gt; a servant of God who bends his back over virgin soil, <span
id="fr_879"></span>[6](#fn_873) they recorded the charge of misery in
the presence of our Lord God: the introduction of Christianity occurs;
blood-vomit, pestilence, drought, a year of locusts, /

smallpox are the charge of misery, &lt;also&gt; the importunity of the
devil. There shall be a white circle in the sky. It shall burn on earth
in Katun 3

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Ahau, in Katun 1 Ahau, the worst of three
katuns. Just as it was written by the Evangelists and the prophet Balam,
it came from the mouth of the Lord of heaven and earth. Then the priests
set it down in holy writ at the time of the great drought at Lahun
Chable <span id="fr_880"></span>[1](#fn_874) in &lt;the time of&gt;
Christianity. Then Saul and Don Antonio Martínez <span
id="fr_881"></span>[2](#fn_875) shall come to avenge <span
id="fr_882"></span>[3](#fn_876) their descendants. The day has dawned.
So it is written in the command of the great priest, the prophet of
Chilam Balam and in the chest of manuscripts. Amen Jesus.

The Interpretation &lt;of&gt; the histories of Yucatan.

The priests, the prophecy &lt;of&gt; Napuctun. <span
id="fr_883"></span>[4](#fn_877)

It shall burn on earth; there shall be a circle in the sky. Kauil <span
id="fr_884"></span>[5](#fn_878) shall be set up; he shall be set up in
front in time to come. It shall burn on earth; <span
id="fr_885"></span>[6](#fn_879) the &lt;very&gt; hoof shall burn in that
katun, in the time which is to come. Fortunate is he who shall see it
when the prophecy is declared, who shall weep over his misfortunes in
time to come. <span id="fr_886"></span>[7](#fn_880)

The prophecy of Ah Kuil Chel, <span id="fr_887"></span>[8](#fn_881) the
priest.

When the end of the katun shall come, lord, ye shall not understand when
it comes. Who shall believe it at the rolling up of the mat of the
katun? <span id="fr_888"></span>[9](#fn_882) The end shall come because
of misery. It comes from the north, it comes from

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

the west at that time when it shall be, lord. Who then shall be the
priest, who then &lt;shall be&gt; the prophet who will declare truly the
word of the book, lord, in &lt;Katun&gt; 9 Ahau? Ye shall not
understand, &lt;ye people&gt; in every part of the world . . . <span
id="fr_889"></span>[1](#fn_883) shall be cleansed of shame. Oh &lt;there
was&gt; joy among the /

|           |
|-----------|
| p\. 105 C |

rulers, pleasure among the rulers of the land. Acknowledge it in your
hearts, ye Itzá. <span id="fr_890"></span>[2](#fn_884)

The prophecy of Nahau Pech the great priest.

At that time when the sun shall stand high <span
id="fr_891"></span>[3](#fn_885) &lt;in the heavens&gt;, lord, when the
ruler has had compassion, in the fourth katun <span
id="fr_892"></span>[4](#fn_886) it shall come to pass, the tidings of
God are truly brought. They ask <span id="fr_893"></span>[5](#fn_887)
perchance what I recommend, lord. You see your guests upon the road, oh
Itzá! It is the fathers of the land <span
id="fr_894"></span>[6](#fn_888) who will arrive. &lt;This prophecy&gt;
comes from the mouth of Nahau Pech, the priest in the time of Katun 4
Ahau <span id="fr_895"></span>[7](#fn_889) at the end of the
katun, <span id="fr_896"></span>[8](#fn_890) lord.

The food of the ant&lt;-like&gt; men shall be destroyed. They shall be
at the end of their food &lt;-supply&gt; because of the *boboch* <span
id="fr_897"></span>[9](#fn_891) &lt;which takes their&gt; food, the
great hawk &lt;which takes their&gt; food, the ant, the cowbird, <span
id="fr_898"></span>[10](#fn_892) the grackle, <span
id="fr_899"></span>[11](#fn_893) the blackbird, <span
id="fr_900"></span>[12](#fn_894) the mouse. <span
id="fr_901"></span>[13](#fn_895)

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

The prophecy of Natzin Yabun Chan.

There was the word of the true God in the land. You shall await the
coming forth, lord, of his priests who will bring <span
id="fr_902"></span>[1](#fn_896) it in time to come. Give your
understanding to his word, to his admonition. <span
id="fr_903"></span>[2](#fn_897) Fortunate are you who truly receive it.
Forsake those things which you have held sacred, oh Itzá; forget your
perishable gods, your transitory gods. Of all things he is the ruler,
lord, the creator of all heaven and earth. It is to your hearts that I
speak, oh Maya Itzá. You shall not desire another God &lt;than&gt; the
true God according to your &lt;own&gt; words. You shall take to heart
the word of my admonition. <span id="fr_904"></span>[3](#fn_898)

The prophecy of Chilam Balam, the singer, of Cabal-c~~h~~en, <span
id="fr_905"></span>[4](#fn_899) Mani.

On &lt;the day&gt; 13 Ahau the katun will end <span
id="fr_906"></span>[5](#fn_900) in the time of the Itzá, in the time of
/

|           |

| p\. 106 C |

Tancah &lt;Mayapan&gt;, lord. There is the sign of Hunab-ku <span
id="fr_907"></span>[6](#fn_901) on high. The raised wooden standard
shall come. <span id="fr_908"></span>[7](#fn_902) It shall be displayed
to the world, that the world may be enlightened, lord. There has been a
beginning of strife, there has been a beginning of rivalry, when the
priestly man shall come to bring the sign &lt;of God&gt; in time to
come, lord. A quarter of a league, <span id="fr_909"></span>[8](#fn_903)
a league &lt;away&gt; he comes. You see the *mut* <span
id="fr_910"></span>[9](#fn_904)-bird surmounting the raised wooden
standard. A new day shall dawn in the north, in the west.

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Itzamná Kauil shall rise. <span
id="fr_911"></span>[1](#fn_905) Our lord comes, <span
id="fr_912"></span>[2](#fn_906) Itzá. Our elder brother comes,
&lt;oh&gt; men of Tantun. <span id="fr_913"></span>[3](#fn_907) Receive
your guests, the bearded men, the men of the east, the bearers of the
sign of God, lord. Good indeed <span id="fr_914"></span>[4](#fn_908) is
the word of God that comes to us. The day of our regeneration <span
id="fr_915"></span>[5](#fn_909) comes. You do not fear the world, Lord,
you are the only God who created us. It is sufficient, then, that the
word of God is good, lord. &lt;He is&gt; the guardian <span
id="fr_916"></span>[6](#fn_910) of our souls. He who receives him, who
has truly believed, he will go to heaven with him. Nevertheless
&lt;at&gt; the beginning were the two-day men.

Let us exalt his sign on high, let us exalt it &lt;that we may gaze upon
it today&gt; <span id="fr_917"></span>[7](#fn_911) with the raised
standard. Great is the discord that arises today. <span
id="fr_918"></span>[8](#fn_912) The First Tree of the World <span
id="fr_919"></span>[9](#fn_913) is restored; it is displayed to the
world. This is the sign of Hunab-ku on high. Worship it, Itzá. You shall
worship today his sign on high. You shall worship it furthermore with
true good will, <span id="fr_920"></span>[10](#fn_914) and you shall
worship the true God today, lord. You shall be converted to the word of
Hunab-ku, lord; it came from heaven. Oh it is he who speaks to
you! <span id="fr_921"></span>[11](#fn_915) Be admonished indeed, Itzá.
They will correct their ways <span id="fr_922"></span>[12](#fn_916) who
receive him in their hearts <span id="fr_923"></span>[13](#fn_917) in
another katun, lord.

Believe in my word itself, I am Chilam Balam, and I have interpreted the
entire message of the true God &lt;of&gt; the world; it is heard in
every part of the world, <span id="fr_924"></span>[14](#fn_918) lord,
the word of God, the Lord of heaven and earth. Very good indeed is his
word in heaven, lord.

He is ruler over us; he is the true God over our souls. /

|           |

| p\. 107 C |

But those to whom &lt;the word&gt; is brought, lord: thrice weighed down
is their <span id="fr_925"></span>[15](#fn_919) strength, the

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

younger brothers <span id="fr_926"></span>[1](#fn_920) native to the
land. Their hearts are submerged &lt;in sin&gt;. Their hearts are dead
in their carnal sins. They are frequent backsliders, <span
id="fr_927"></span>[2](#fn_921) the principal ones who spread
&lt;sin&gt;, Nacxit Xuchit <span id="fr_928"></span>[3](#fn_922) in the
carnal sin of his companions, the two-day rulers. <span
id="fr_929"></span>[4](#fn_923) &lt;They sit&gt; crookedly on their
thrones; crookedly in carnal sin. Two-day men they call them. For two
days &lt;endure&gt; their seats, <span id="fr_930"></span>[5](#fn_924)
their cups, their hats. <span id="fr_931"></span>[6](#fn_925) They are
the unrestrained lewd <span id="fr_932"></span>[7](#fn_926) ones of the
day, the unrestrained lewd ones of the night, <span
id="fr_933"></span>[8](#fn_927) the rogues of the world. They twist
their necks, they wink their eyes, they slaver at the mouth, <span
id="fr_934"></span>[9](#fn_928) at the rulers of the land, lord. Behold,
when they come, there is no truth in the words of the foreigners to the
land. They tell very solemn and mysterious things, the sons of the men
of Seven-deserted-buildings, the offspring of the women of
Seven-deserted-buildings, <span id="fr_935"></span>[10](#fn_929) lord.

Who will be the prophet, who will be the priest who shall interpret
truly the word of the book?

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_869"></span>[164:2](cbc29.htm#fr_875) These are
fundamentally prophecies of the return of Kukulcan, or Quetzalcoatl, the
Mexican culture-hero; but after the arrival of the Spaniards they were
believed to be prognostics of that event and were in some instances
adapted in later times to fit the facts of the actual occurrence. *Cf.*
Tozzer 1921, p. 192. A discussion of these prognostications, their
reputed authors and their place in the prophetic literature of the Maya
will be found in Appendix D.

<span id="fn_870"></span>[164:3](cbc29.htm#fr_876) A term applied to the
Itzá in the Tizimin MS. It may well be a reference to the Itzá custom of
killing off the older men to prevent their becoming sorcerers, though we
do not hear of their killing the older women. *Cf.* Appendix C.

<span id="fn_871"></span>[164:4](cbc29.htm#fr_877) Probably the foreign
Nahua who invaded Yucatan. *Cf.* page 88, note  [1](cbc14.htm#fn_234).

<span id="fn_872"></span>[164:5](cbc29.htm#fr_878) Literally, a new day
shall dawn. Both the literal and figurative meanings of this expression
are given in the Motul Dictionary.

<span id="fn_873"></span>[164:6](cbc29.htm#fr_879) Possibly a
description applied by the missionaries to themselves.

<span id="fn_874"></span>[165:1](cbc29.htm#fr_880) Lahun Chable:
possibly the same as Chablé. *Cf.* page 159, note
 [9](cbc27.htm#fn_836).

<span id="fn_875"></span>[165:2](cbc29.htm#fr_881) *Cf.* page 123, note
 [8](cbc20.htm#fn_530), and page 157, note  [7](cbc27.htm#fn_808).

<span id="fn_876"></span>[165:3](cbc29.htm#fr_882) Alternative
translation: to collect the debts of their descendants, etc.

<span id="fn_877"></span>[165:4](cbc29.htm#fr_883) Of the five following
prophecies the Maya text has been copied from the Chilam Balam of Mani
in Codex Perez, pages 72-73, and from the Chilam Balam of Oxkutzcab in
Codex Perez, pages 166-170. Accompanying the latter are Spanish
translations of the first four. Berendt ascribes the latter version of
these prophecies to the Chilam Balam of Ixil, but they are not to be
found in the reproduction of the Ixil; and the Perez Codex indicates
that they are a part of the copy of the Chilam Balam of Oxkutzcab which
immediately precedes them. The Maya text of the prophecies of Nahau
Pech, Natzin Yabun Chan and Chilam Balam are given in the Tizimin MS.,
pages 17, 18.

The Maya text and Spanish translations of all five have been published
in Lizana 1893, pages 37-39. The Maya text and an English translation of
the prophecy of Nahau Pech appear in Brinton 1882, pages 255-256; the
text and English translation of the prophecy of Chilam Balam are given
in Tozzer 1921, pages 122-128.

Spanish translations of all five prophecies are to be found in Cogolludo
1868, Book 2, chapter 11, and in Villagutierre Soto-Mayor 1701, pages
36-37. Tozzer (1921, pages 192-194) gives a full bibliography of the
modern literature covering the subject.

<span id="fn_878"></span>[165:5](cbc29.htm#fr_884) Kauil is an obsolete
word meaning food. *Cf.* *kauilyah*, to beg for food (Motul). It also
appears to be the name of a god as in Itzamna Kauil. Kauil is also a
common family name in Yucatan.

<span id="fn_879"></span>[165:6](cbc29.htm#fr_885) We are reminded of
the portents said to have presaged the Spanish Conquest of Mexico:
"there appeared in the sky a pyramidal flame of fire, which ascended
from midnight till sun-rising, when it came into the south, and then
vanish'd" (Herrera 1726, Dec. 2, Book 10, Chap. 1).

<span id="fn_880"></span>[165:7](cbc29.htm#fr_886) The Maya text is
accompanied by a Spanish translation in the Chilam Balam of Oxkutzcab
which reads as follows: "*Habrá final culto de los Dioses vanos y el
mundo sera purificado con fuego. El que esta viere sera llamado dichoso
si con dolor llorare sus pecados*" (Codex Perez, p. 167). The translator
has difficulty in finding any close correspondence between this and the
Maya text of the prophecy. The setting up of Kauil is a figure of speech
which is difficult to understand.

<span id="fn_881"></span>[165:8](cbc29.htm#fr_887) Called Kauil C~~h~~el
in the Oxkutzcab, Ah Kauil Chel in the Tizimin (p. 13) and Mani (Codex
Perez, p. 72), and Ah Kukil Chel by Cogolludo (Book 2, chap 11).

<span id="fn_882"></span>[165:9](cbc29.htm#fr_888) *Cf.* page 135, note
 [3](cbc24.htm#fn_641).

<span id="fn_883"></span>[166:1](cbc29.htm#fr_889) Part of the text is
obliterated here, and this portion of the prophecy does not occur in any
of the other versions; the translation is therefore a little uncertain.

<span id="fn_884"></span>[166:2](cbc29.htm#fr_890) We find the following
purported translation in the Book of Chilam Balam of Oxkutzcab: "*La
interpretacion. En el fin de la edad presente los que ignorais futuras
que &lt;e&gt;dad pensais que sucederá: sabed pues que vendran de todas
partes tales cosas por nuestros malos. Historia. Que los podreis tener
por presentes y os digo que en la edad novena ningun sacerdote ni
profeta os declarara las escrituras que generalmente ignorais*." The
fulfilment of this very vague prophecy was evidently the
Christianization of Yucatan in Katun 9 Ahau.

<span id="fn_885"></span>[166:3](cbc29.htm#fr_891) This version of the
prophecy of Nahau Pech is the only one which corresponds here to the
time-honored translation by the early Spanish missionaries. The other
versions read: "At that time the news shall be understood."

<span id="fn_886"></span>[166:4](cbc29.htm#fr_892) This statement, "in
the fourth katun," can be taken two ways. It could be either the fourth
katun after the fall of Mayapan, Katun 13 Ahau, when the Spaniards made
their first and unsuccessful attempt to conquer Yucatan, or Katun 9
Ahau, the fourth katun after the time of Nahau Pech who lived in Katun 4
Ahau. Katun 9 Ahau was really the period when the general conversion of
the Mayas was effected.

<span id="fn_887"></span>[166:5](cbc29.htm#fr_893) A space has been left
in the Chumayel text here which has been supplied from the Tizimin
version. The Mani version reads: "You ask what I recommend." The Spanish
translation renders this sentence: "With great concern I recommend,"
etc.

<span id="fn_888"></span>[166:6](cbc29.htm#fr_894) A term equally
applicable to the priests of Quetzalcoatl and the Christian
missionaries.

<span id="fn_889"></span>[166:7](cbc29.htm#fr_895) Katun 4 Ahau ended
either in 1497 or 1500 according to which correlation is accepted.

<span id="fn_890"></span>[166:8](cbc29.htm#fr_896) The rest of the
prophecy does not appear in any of the other versions.

<span id="fn_891"></span>[166:9](cbc29.htm#fr_897) Pio Perez defines
*boboch* as a fabulous animal. The name may be derived from *bob*,
another mysterious animal, and *och*, an opossum.

<span id="fn_892"></span>[166:10](cbc29.htm#fr_898) Maya *¢iu*,
*Tangavius æneus involucratus* Lesson. *Cf.* Roys 1931, page 344.

<span id="fn_893"></span>[166:11](cbc29.htm#fr_899) Maya *kau*,
*Megaquiscalus major macrourus* Swainson. *Cf.* ibid., page 334.

<span id="fn_894"></span>[166:12](cbc29.htm#fr_900) Maya *pich*,
*Dives dives* Lichtenstein. Ibid., page 338.

<span id="fn_895"></span>[166:13](cbc29.htm#fr_901) The Spanish
translation given for this prophecy in the Chilam Balam of Oxkutzcab is
as follows: "*En el dia que mas alumbrare el sol por la misericordia del
omnipotente, vendra de aquí a cuatro edades los que han de traer la
nueva de ese Dios con grande afecto, os encomiendo, esperais oh
itzalanos nuestros huespedes que son los padres de la tierra cuando
vengan. Profetizó Nahau Pech sacerdote en los dias de la cuarta edad
acerca de su principio*."

<span id="fn_896"></span>[167:1](cbc29.htm#fr_902) Here the Maya
*puchcob* has been translated as though it were *pulicob*.

<span id="fn_897"></span>[167:2](cbc29.htm#fr_903) *Tzacil* is
translated as though it were *tzecil*, for which it may be an antiquated
form. The word *tzac* has survived only in compounds and means an
incantation.

<span id="fn_898"></span>[167:3](cbc29.htm#fr_904) The Spanish
translation of this prophecy in the Oxkutzcab manuscript reads: "*Hecha
fue la palabra de Dios sobre la tierra, la cual esperad que ella vendrá
que sus sacerdotes os la traerán; aprended sus palabras y predicacion.
Bien aventurados los que aprendieron; o Ytzalanos, aborreced ya vuestros
dioses, olvidad los que ya son fundibles; adorad todos el Dios de la
verdad que está poderoso en todas partes y que es criador de todas las
cosas*."

<span id="fn_899"></span>[167:4](cbc29.htm#fr_905) The Chumayel text
reads Cauichen, but the Tizimin version calls it Cabal-chen, which is
still the name of the cenote at Mani. it is in a cave and approached by
a path, but there is also an opening like a well in the roof of the cave
directly above the pool.

Tozzer has made a valuable study of this prophecy in which he has
compared the Tizimin, Chumayel and Lizana versions of the text with the
reading by Martinez, and his own translation with those of Lizana and
Martinez.

<span id="fn_900"></span>[167:5](cbc29.htm#fr_906) The Tizimin,
Oxkutzcab and Lizana versions of the text read: "the katun shall be
established." In either case the meaning is approximately the same. This
is the day when Katun 13 Ahau ends and when the new Katun 11 Ahau is
established.

<span id="fn_901"></span>[167:6](cbc29.htm#fr_907) "Hunabku: the only
living and true god, and he was the greatest of the gods of the people
of Yucatan. He had no form because they said that he could not be
represented as he was incorporeal." (Motul.)

<span id="fn_902"></span>[167:7](cbc29.htm#fr_908) Maya, *uaom che*,
literally a raised wooden standard. The Ticul Dictionary defines the
term as "*picota, horca, ó rollo*," indicating a raised pole on which
the heads of malefactors were exposed. The missionaries applied the term
to the cross, but originally it probably meant a ceremonial pole or
standard, perhaps a mythological tree.

<span id="fn_903"></span>[167:8](cbc29.htm#fr_909) Maya, *hun auat*, the
distance that a cry can be heard.

<span id="fn_904"></span>[167:9](cbc29.htm#fr_910) Defined as a bird of
the Cracidæ family (Maler 1908, p. 132). *Mut* can also mean news, but
in this context the bird seems to be intended. Martinez has noted that a
quetzal appears on the cross at Palenque (Tozzer 1921, p. 123, note 7).
Also what appears to be a conventionalized bird surmounts the cross on
the katun-wheel in the Chilam Balam of Kaua.

<span id="fn_905"></span>[168:1](cbc29.htm#fr_911) Alternative
translation: shall awaken. Both this phrase and the statement "Kauil
shall be set up" in the prophecy of Napuctun ([p. 165](#page_165)) are
translated by the missionaries: "the worship of the vain gods shall
cease." Possibly Itzamna Kauil, at one time the supreme Maya god, is
here identified with the Christian God.

<span id="fn_906"></span>[168:2](cbc29.htm#fr_912) Alternative
translation: our father comes.

<span id="fn_907"></span>[168:3](cbc29.htm#fr_913) On page
[66](cbc06.htm#page_66) Tantun is associated with the Island of Cozumel
which was a holy place visited by many pilgrims. Lizana puts it in the
plural and translates the expression; "*o Tantunites*," i.e. oh ye men
of Tantun. Apparently it is an exhortation to them to receive
Christianity.

<span id="fn_908"></span>[168:4](cbc29.htm#fr_914) Maya, *ka*: "appended
to certain expressions it embellishes, as: *Bax u ka Dias*? What is God?
*Bax u ka lo*? What is that?" (Motul).

<span id="fn_909"></span>[168:5](cbc29.htm#fr_915) Literally, our life.

<span id="fn_910"></span>[168:6](cbc29.htm#fr_916) *Cf.* page 69, note
 [2](cbc07.htm#fn_73).

<span id="fn_911"></span>[168:7](cbc29.htm#fr_917) Supplied from the
Tizimin, Mani, Oxkutzcab and Lizana versions.

<span id="fn_912"></span>[168:8](cbc29.htm#fr_918) Here the text varies
somewhat in the different versions.

<span id="fn_913"></span>[168:9](cbc29.htm#fr_919) *Cf.* page 102, note
 [2](cbc15.htm#fn_327). Here this mythological tree is said to be
restored, apparently as the Christian cross.

<span id="fn_914"></span>[168:10](cbc29.htm#fr_920) Written *colah* in
the Chumayel text, which is obscure. Here the Mani version, *a uolah*
has been followed; but the Oxkutzcab version, *ocolal*, which means
faith, is equally acceptable.

<span id="fn_915"></span>[168:11](cbc29.htm#fr_921) Alternative
translations: he who commands you, or he who has power over you.

<span id="fn_916"></span>[168:12](cbc29.htm#fr_922) Literally: a day
will dawn for them or the world will awaken for them. The figurative
meaning given above is not unusual and is authorized by the Motul
Dictionary.

<span id="fn_917"></span>[168:13](cbc29.htm#fr_923) Maya, *ol*.
Primarily it means the will, but figuratively it is "the true heart, not
the physical one" (Motul). The organ is called *puczikal*.

<span id="fn_918"></span>[168:14](cbc29.htm#fr_924) The remainder of the
prophecy as given here does not occur in any of the other versions or
translations.

<span id="fn_919"></span>[168:15](cbc29.htm#fr_925) Written "your
strength" in the text.

<span id="fn_920"></span>[169:1](cbc29.htm#fr_926) In the various
prophecies believed to foretell the coming of the Spaniards, the Indians
are called "the younger brothers," and the new-comers, "the elder
brothers." That these terms originally signified the first inhabitants
of Yucatan and the Itzá invaders is indicated by the following passage
in the Tizimin MS.: "This was when the time of the white men, the
bearded, men was known, just as the priest Chilam declared the time of
the arrival of their elder brothers, just as the hosts of Itzá had
already arrived among them" (Tizimin, p. 36).

<span id="fn_921"></span>[169:2](cbc29.htm#fr_927) Maya, *ah uaua
tulupoob*: literally, those who often turn back.

<span id="fn_922"></span>[169:3](cbc29.htm#fr_928) Nacxit Xuchit, cf.
page 83, note  [5](cbc10.htm#fn_214).

<span id="fn_923"></span>[169:4](cbc29.htm#fr_929) *Cf.* page 83, note
 [6](cbc10.htm#fn_215).

<span id="fn_924"></span>[169:5](cbc29.htm#fr_930) Maya, *xec*, defined
as a straight chair without arms. Apparently it indicated authority.

<span id="fn_925"></span>[169:6](cbc29.htm#fr_931) The early Spanish
writers make no mention of hats. The Maya word, *ppooc*, was applied to
a hat, hood or cap, as well as to a crown of flowers (Motul). Elaborate
head-dresses are found on Maya monuments of almost every period, and in
the Temple of the Warriors at Chichen Itzá are carved head-dresses which
are plainly hats in the modern sense of the word (Morris, Charlot and
Morris, 1931, p. 278 and Pls. 50 and 52).

<span id="fn_926"></span>[169:7](cbc29.htm#fr_932) Maya, *co*, defined
as "Mad, unrestrained, insolent, deceitful and lewd" (Motul). In many of
its compounds it means lewd.

<span id="fn_927"></span>[169:8](cbc29.htm#fr_933) Maya, *u co akab*,
could also be translated as the mad one of the night. *Ah-coo-akab* is
the name of the Yucatan screech-owl, probably on account of its cry.
*Cf.* Roys 1931, page 329.

<span id="fn_928"></span>[169:9](cbc29.htm#fr_934) *Cf.* page 151, note
8. Alternative translation: they pout their lips. Here it appears to
refer to certain foreigners who introduced these wild orgies. The
reference to Nacxit Xuchit indicates a people of Nahua traditions and
some Nahua elements. Nacxit Xuchit is expressly associated with the Itzá
on pages [83](cbc10.htm#page_83) and [84](cbc10.htm#page_84) of the
present work.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[169:10](cbc29.htm#fr_935) Maya,
*Uuc-tocoy-naob*. This allusion to deserted ruined buildings suggests
that the Itzá came from a land where there were already deserted and
ruined cities in ancient times. Could this refer to the cities of the
Old Empire in the south? We are reminded of the mixture of Maya and
Mexican features occurring in the drawings incised on the latest stucco
covering of the inner walls of the temples at Tikal. Here are
spear-throwers (atlatls) of the Mexican type and a row of the little
flags which were a Mexican numerical symbol, both of which are
practically unknown to the old Maya sculptures. *Cf.* Maler 1911, pages
56-63. Compare the standards, or "way-signs," incised on one of the
Tikal temples (Maler 1911, fig. 14), with those painted on the Temple of
the Warriors at Chichen Itzá (Morris, Charlot & Morris 1931, fig. 323).
