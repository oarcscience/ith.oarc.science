<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

 <span id="fr_618"></span>[1](#fn_615) Katun 11 Ahau is established at
Ichcaanzihoo. <span id="fr_619"></span>[2](#fn_616) Yax-haal Chac <span
id="fr_620"></span>[3](#fn_617) is its face. The heavenly fan, the
heavenly bouquet shall descend. The drum and rattle of Ah
Bolon-yocte <span id="fr_621"></span>[4](#fn_618) shall resound. At that
time there shall be the green turkey; at that time there shall be Zulim
Chan; at that time there shall be Chakanputun. <span
id="fr_622"></span>[5](#fn_619) They shall find their food among the
trees; they shall find their food among the rocks, those who have lost
their crops in Katun 11 Ahau.

 <span id="fr_623"></span>[6](#fn_620) The katun is established at
Uuc-yab-nal in Katun 4 Ahau. At the mouth of the well,
Uuc-yab-nal, <span id="fr_624"></span>[7](#fn_621) it is established ...
It shall dawn in the south. <span id="fr_625"></span>[8](#fn_622) The
face of &lt;the lord of the katun&gt; is covered; his face is dead.
There is mourning for water; there is mourning for bread. <span
id="fr_626"></span>[9](#fn_623) His mat and his throne shall face the
west. <span id="fr_627"></span>[10](#fn_624) Blood-vomit is the charge
&lt;of the katun&gt;. <span id="fr_628"></span>[11](#fn_625) At that
time his loin-cloth and his mantle shall be white. <span
id="fr_629"></span>[12](#fn_626) Unattainable shall be the bread of the
katun. The quetzal shall come; the green bird shall come. The *kax* tree
shall come; the bird shall come. <span id="fr_630"></span>[13](#fn_627)
The tapir shall come. The tribute shall be hidden at the mouth of the
well. <span id="fr_631"></span>[14](#fn_628)

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

The katun is established at Maylu, Zaci, Mayapan <span
id="fr_632"></span>[1](#fn_629) in Katun 2 Ahau. The katun &lt;stone&gt;
is on its own base. The rope shall descend; the poison of the serpent
shall descend, pestilence &lt;and&gt; three piles of skulls. The men are
of little use. <span id="fr_633"></span>[2](#fn_630) Then the burden was
bound on Buluc-c~~h~~abtan. <span id="fr_634"></span>[3](#fn_631)
&lt;Then there came up&gt; a dry wind. The ramon <span
id="fr_635"></span>[4](#fn_632) is the bread of &lt;Katun&gt; 2 Ahau. It
shall be half famine and half abundance. This is the charge of Katun 2
Ahau.

The Katun is established at Kinchil Coba, <span
id="fr_636"></span>[5](#fn_633) Maya Cuzamil, <span
id="fr_637"></span>[6](#fn_634) in Katun 13 Ahau. Itzamna,
Itzam-tzab, <span id="fr_638"></span>[7](#fn_635) is his face during its
reign. The ramon shall be eaten. Three years shall be locust years, ten
generations &lt;of locusts&gt;. The fan shall be displayed; the bouquet
shall be displayed, <span id="fr_639"></span>[8](#fn_636) borne by
Yaxaal Chac in the heavens. Unattainable is the bread of the katun in 13
Ahau. The sun shall be /

eclipsed. Double is the charge of the katun: men without offspring,
chiefs without successors. <span id="fr_640"></span>[9](#fn_637) For
five days the sun shall be eclipsed, then it shall be seen
&lt;again&gt;. <span id="fr_641"></span>[10](#fn_638) This is the charge
of Katun 13 Ahau.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_614"></span>[132:1](cbc23.htm#fr_617) For a full discussion
of the Maya katun wheel the reader is referred to Bowditch 1910,
Appendix II, and to Landa 1929, pp. 94-97. The katun series with its
prophecies is discussed in Appendix D of the present work. Among the
various katun wheels, this one is unique in that the beginning of each
prophecy is set down opposite the number of the katun to which it
corresponds, i.e. the day with its number on which the katun ends.

Here the cross is set above Katun 13 Ahau, but in Landa's wheel the
cross is over Katun 11 Ahau, which is usually considered to be the first
of the series, and indeed it begins with the day 1 Imix.

It should be noted that on this wheel, although the succession of katuns
is as usual to the right, the sequence of the directions, or
world-quarters, East, North, West and South, is to the left.

<span id="fn_615"></span>[133:1](cbc23.htm#fr_618) Here we have four of
the first and older series or katun-prophecies. *Cf.* p. 20 and Appendix
D.

<span id="fn_616"></span>[133:2](cbc23.htm#fr_619) Ichcaanzihoo is the
Maya name of Merida. It is also called Tihoo.

<span id="fn_617"></span>[133:3](cbc23.htm#fr_620) Yax-haal Chac is the
Green Rain-god. *Cf.* p. 77, note  [4](cbc08.htm#fn_161).

<span id="fn_618"></span>[133:4](cbc23.htm#fr_621) A comparison of this
version of the prophecy with that on p. 20 indicates that Ah Bolon-yocte
was the lord or idol of Katun 11 Ahau. The name might be translated as
the nine-footed one, but its meaning is uncertain.

<span id="fn_619"></span>[133:5](cbc23.htm#fr_622) The green turkey,
Zulim Chan and Chakanputun, are symbols of other times when the people
were driven from their homes into the forest, as they were again in
Katun 11 Ahau by the Spanish conquerors. *Cf.* p. 77, note
 [7](cbc08.htm#fn_164).

<span id="fn_620"></span>[133:6](cbc23.htm#fr_623) The series is
incomplete; Katuns 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 12, 10, 8 and 6 Ahau are omitted here.

<span id="fn_621"></span>[133:7](cbc23.htm#fr_624) We know nothing of
Uuc-yab-nal beyond what is stated here. In the prophecy for this same
Katun 4 Ahau on page 161, it is said to be established at Chichen Itzá,
and here Uuc-yab-nal is said to be "at the mouth of the well" (*tu chi
c~~h~~een*). We can only conclude that Uuc-yab-nal was the ancient name
of the old city of Chichen Itzá before the Itzá came and called it "the
mouth of the well of the Itzá." *Uuc* means seven, and Abnal is still a
well-known Maya family name.

<span id="fn_622"></span>[133:8](cbc23.htm#fr_625) Here the Chumayel
text means little to the translator, and it may be corrupt. Consequently
the Tizimin version of the same passage has been given as the correct
one.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[133:9](cbc23.htm#fr_626) In other words, it
shall be a time of drought and famine.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[133:10](cbc23.htm#fr_627) Here again the
Chumayel text seems meaningless, and the Tizimin and Mani version of the
same prophecy is assumed to be the correct one and translated
accordingly. A comparison of these three versions will be found in the
Maya text.

<span id="fn_625"></span>[133:11](cbc23.htm#fr_628) Evidently a
reference to the epidemic mentioned on [p. 142](cbc26.htm#page_142) as
occurring in the fifth tun of the Katun 4 Ahau last preceding the
Spanish Conquest. This tun would fall between 1480 and 1485. This was
probably the pestilence said by Landa to be characterized by a fever
followed by the body swelling and being filled with worms. The
blood-vomit and fever strongly suggest yellow fever, and the last
symptom could refer to secondary infections such as abscesses and
suppurations in which flies had laid their eggs. It should be noted,
however, that the medical historians do not believe that yellow fever
occurred in America prior to the Spanish conquest. *Cf.* Landa 1928, pp.
92-94.

<span id="fn_626"></span>[133:12](cbc23.htm#fr_629) A reference to the
white garments of the priests of Quetzalcoatl. Under the Maya name of
Kukulcan, this culture-hero is said to have come with the Itzá in a
Katun 4 Ahau. *Cf.* [p. 161](cbc27.htm#page_161), also Landa 1928, p.
62.

<span id="fn_627"></span>[133:13](cbc23.htm#fr_630) Maya *kax-te*.
Possibly the *kax*, or *Randia longiloba* Hemsl., is intended. The
reference to the bird and tree suggests the mythological symbols already
noted. *Cf.* p. 100, note 5.

<span id="fn_628"></span>[133:14](cbc23.htm#fr_631) The Sacrificial
Cenote at Chichen Itzá may be meant here. *Cf.* Appendix B.

<span id="fn_629"></span>[134:1](cbc23.htm#fr_632) Maylu is not
identified; Zaci is the Maya name for Valladolid; and Mayapan, the
former capital of Yucatan is well known.

<span id="fn_630"></span>[134:2](cbc23.htm#fr_633) In other words, they
are weakened by the pestilence, of which the "three piles of skulls"
constituted the symbol. Serapio Zumarraga, an aged Indian of Mani, knows
the latter term (*ox-multun-tzek*) and explains it as three burial
mounds for the Spaniards, mestizos and Indians. in ancient times the
corresponding classes of society were nobles, commoners and slaves.

<span id="fn_631"></span>[134:3](cbc23.htm#fr_634) Buluc-c~~h~~abtan
could be translated, eleven penances or eleven times fortunate. It
appears to be the name of a personage, possibly a deity.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[134:4](cbc23.htm#fr_635) The dried seeds of
the ramon tree (*Brosimum alicastrum* Sw.) are ground into a meal from
which a sort of bread is made. It took the place of corn in time of
famine.

<span id="fn_633"></span>[134:5](cbc23.htm#fr_636) Any mention of the
great and ancient city of Coba is of especial interest as Maya history
is silent concerning it. Here, possibly the city itself is meant, though
Kinchil Coba is usually treated as a personage, one of the priests
associated with the thirteen katun-prophecies in the Mani and Kaua
manuscripts. In the translation by C. P. Bowditch of Avendaño's
Relación, now in the Peabody Museum at Cambridge, we read: "This image
(of Cortez' horse) they preserved till the present time and they worship
it as they do also the statue of a man made of stone and lime, situated
on the top of a hillock, which they call Kinchilcoba, who they say is
their watchman and sentinel, who defends them against all misfortunes
which can happen to them" (Avendaño MS. f. 29 v; Bowditch MS., p. 68).
Coba is still a well-known family name and is also the name of a tree
which the Indians say is to be found in the forests of Campeche. *Co-ba*
could be translated gopher-tooth, just as *ne-ba* (another unidentified
plant or tree) means gopher-tail.

<span id="fn_634"></span>[134:6](cbc23.htm#fr_637) This place-name
suggests the island of Cozumel, but on the katun-wheel it is associated
with Mayapan.

<span id="fn_635"></span>[134:7](cbc23.htm#fr_638) Itzamna was the god
of the heavens, and Itzam-tzab may be another name for the constellation
called *tzab*, "the Pleiades, a constellation of seven stars; also the
rattles of the snake" (Motul).

<span id="fn_636"></span>[134:8](cbc23.htm#fr_639) *Cf.* p. 77, note
 [5](cbc08.htm#fn_162).

<span id="fn_637"></span>[134:9](cbc23.htm#fr_640) The Oxkutzcab version
of this prophecy (p. 202) gives the double charge of this katun as
pestilence and famine.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[134:10](cbc23.htm#fr_641) This belief that an
eclipse might last five days probably reflects a legend to the effect
that such was once the case. It would explain the frantic efforts of the
people to bring it to an end. *Cf.* Aguilar 1921, pp. 203-204.
