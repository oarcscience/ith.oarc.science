3 Ahau.

On this 18th day of August, 1766, occurred a hurricane. I have made a
record of it in order that it may be seen how many years it will be
before another one will occur.

On this 20th day of January, 1782, there was an epidemic of inflammation
here in the town of Chumayel. The swelling began at the neck and then
descended. &lt;It spread&gt; from the little ones to the adults, until
it swept the entire house, once it was introduced. The remedy was sour
ashes <span id="fr_687"></span>[5](#fn_684) and lemons or the young
*Siempre vive*. <span id="fr_688"></span>[6](#fn_685) It was the year of
'81 when it began. After that there was a great drought also. There was
scarcely any rain. The entire

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_669"></span>[140:4](cbc26.htm#fr_672) Of the five
chronicles found in the Books of Chilam Balam this is the most puzzling.
Much of its material is found in the others, but the dates and sequence
of events are different. Here Hunac Ceel is said to have lived prior to
the destruction of Chakanputun, and the fall of Mayapan is placed in
Katun 1 Ahau, three katuns prior to its well established date in Katun 8
Ahau. Nevertheless a number of events are dated within the katun with an
apparent precision not found in the other chronicles.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[141:1](cbc26.htm#fr_673) Alternative
translation: when the merchants were dispersed. This might be a
reference to some occasion when foreign merchants were driven from the
country. Brinton's translation, "the well-dressed ones" is based on a
slight error by Berendt in copying the original manuscript. He wrote *ah
oni* for *ah coni*.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[141:2](cbc26.htm#fr_674) Kin-ich Kak-moo, lit.
sun-eyed fiery macaw, was a sort of sun-god whose rays descended and
consumed sacrifices to him. This deity, whose idol was at Izamal, was a
protector against disease (Cogolludo 1868, Book 4, Chap. 8).

<span id="fn_672"></span>[141:3](cbc26.htm#fr_675) The place-name
Zaclactun has survived only in that of the hacienda of Salactun in the
district of Izamal (Berendt: Nombres propios en lengua Maya, f. 73 v.).

<span id="fn_673"></span>[141:4](cbc26.htm#fr_676) We find the names of
these leaders mentioned in the historical reports of the first Spanish
settlers. "The inhabitants of the said city (Izamal) were conquered by
Kak-u-pacal and Uilo, valorous captains of the Itzá who were the people
who founded Mayapan" (Relaciones de Yucatan, I, p. 269). "In the course
of time the inhabitants of the said town (Motul) were conquered by
Kak-u-pacal and one hundred valorous captains formerly of the city of
Mayapan" (*Ibid*, I, p. 119). Evidently the fall of Chakanputun, the
establishment of Mayapan and the Itzá conquest of the important cities
of northern Yucatan all took place within a single generation.
Kak-u-pacal, literally fiery glance, was deified and worshipped at the
time of the Spanish Conquest (Cogolludo 1868, Book 4, Chap. 8).

<span id="fn_674"></span>[142:1](cbc26.htm#fr_677) Brinton and Martinez
both consider these invaders to have been Caribs because of the
cannibalism and nudity mentioned. Down to the middle of the Eighteenth
Century Mosquito Indians in canoes from Rio Tinto, Honduras, were still
making raids on the east coast of Yucatan. (MS. map of Yucatan by Juan
de Dios Gonsalez, 1766.) It seems likely that similar incursions took
place in pre-Columbian times. The skirt (Maya pic) referred to is
certainly a woman's garment. Possibly *ppic* is intended. This was the
*sobre carga*, a bundle carried above the usual traveler's pack. *Cf.*
Motul.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[142:2](cbc26.htm#fr_678) *Cf.* p. 139, note
 [5](cbc25.htm#fn_665).

<span id="fn_676"></span>[142:3](cbc26.htm#fr_679) Tancah may refer to
the portion of Mayapan lying outside the walls.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[142:4](cbc26.htm#fr_680) *Cf.* p. 133, note
 [11](cbc23.htm#fn_625).

<span id="fn_678"></span>[142:5](cbc26.htm#fr_681) This taking of the
stone evidently refers to the Maya custom of setting up a monument every
7200 days to commemorate the katun that has just passed. *Cf.* Landa
1929, pages 94-98. Avendaño states that the thirteen katuns were
ascribed to each of thirteen provinces in turn. *Cf.* Appendix D.

A parallel passage found on page 95 of the Codex Perez ascribes these
ceremonies as follows: 1 Ahau, Izamal; 12 Ahau. Zizal; 10 Ahau. Kulche;
8 Ahau, Hunucma; 6 Ahau, Chacalna; 4 Ahau, Tiix-Kulche; 2 Ahau, Euan; 13
Ahau, Colox-peten; and states that in 11 Ahau when the Spaniards arrived
no stone was taken. Izamal, Hunucma and Zizal are well-known towns. Euan
is in the district of Izamal. Hunacthi is said to be in the Province of
Mani (Molina Solís 1896, p. 219). Otzmal is now a hacienda two leagues
south of Sotula, and Kancaba is the name of a hacienda in the district
of Valladolid (Berendt, Nom, prop. de Yuc. f. 55 v.).

<span id="fn_679"></span>[142:6](cbc26.htm#fr_682) In the Mani, Tizimin
and first Chumayel chronicles this event was placed in Katun 13 Ahau but
confused with some unknown episode which occurred in a year 4 Kan,
presumably 1545 (*Cf.* p. 138, note  [3](cbc24.htm#fn_656)). The year 4
Kan fell in Katun 11 Ahau, and in this chronicle the actual death of the
rain-bringer is ascribed to the latter katun.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[143:1](cbc26.htm#fr_683) "Verbi gratia. The
Indians state that the Spaniards completed their arrival at the city of
Merida in the year A.D. 1541, which was exactly the first year of the
era 11 Ahau" (Landa 1929, p. 98). The truth of this statement is open to
question, but it agrees with the date mentioned in the present
chronicle.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[143:2](cbc26.htm#fr_684) In these chronicles
Christianity is usually said to have begun in Katun 9 Ahau. The present
reference may be to the arrival of Fr. Villalpando in 1546. On page
[145](cbc27.htm#page_145) we shall see the statement that the
missionaries arrived in 1545.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[143:3](cbc26.htm#fr_685) In the Books of
Chilam Balam the year 1519 is given an importance out of all proportion
to the fact that it was the year when Cortez landed and remained for a
short time in Cozumel. On page [81](cbc10.htm#page_81) we have seen this
date associated with a treaty with the Spaniards which must have
occurred much later; again on page [84](cbc10.htm#page_84) we have seen
the foundation of Merida and that of the Convent of San Francisco
ascribed to the same year.

The Maya text is not divided into sentences, and the present translation
is based on a sentence arrangement which changes the meaning materially
from that of Brinton's translation, which is as follows: "The eleventh
ahau: in the time of its beginning, the stone of Coloxpeten was taken;
in this katun died Apula Napotxiu, in the first year of the eleventh
ahau; it was also in this katun that the Spaniards first arrived here in
this land, in the seventh year of the eleventh ahau katun; also
Christianity began in the year fifteen hundred and nineteen, the year of
our Lord 1519" (Brinton 1882, pp. 171172). Although it is possible that
Brinton's rendition is the correct one, preference is given to the
sentence arrangement given above, because Maya writers usually place a
temporal phrase or clause beginning with the particle *ti* before the
main clause of the sentence. Indeed Dr. Andrade reports that in
present-day spoken Maya a temporal clause with *ti* precedes the main
clause.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[143:4](cbc26.htm#fr_686) Bishop Toral arrived
in Yucatan in 1562.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[143:5](cbc26.htm#fr_687) Possibly a lye
solution is meant.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[143:6](cbc26.htm#fr_688) Maya, *zizal-xiu*,
the *Bryophyllum pinnatun* (Lam.) S. Kurz. It is called *Siempre vive*,
*Admirable* and *Sinverguenza* in Spanish (Roys 1931, p. 310).

<span id="fn_686"></span>[144:1](cbc26.htm#fr_689) Juan Josef Hoil is
considered the compiler of the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[144:2](cbc26.htm#fr_690) This note is made in
a different hand from the usual text of the Chumayel. The date might be
1818, 1838 or 1858. The last has been chosen as the most probable.
