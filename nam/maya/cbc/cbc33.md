# APPENDIX D

### THE MAYA PROPHECIES

Prophecy played an important part in the lives of the Maya and occupied
a prominent position in their literature. Nor was the Maya prophet
without honor in his own country. Foretelling the future was the
profession of a special branch of the priesthood, the members of which
were called *chilans*. The word means mouthpiece, spokesman or
interpreter, and it was the *chilans* who delivered to the people the
responses of the gods. They were held in such high esteem that they were
carried on men's shoulders when they went abroad. <span
id="fr_984"></span>[1](#fn_977.md) In the Tizimin manuscript we find an
account <span id="fr_985"></span>[2](#fn_978.md) of the manner in which
Chilam Balam. gave his prophecy, and it is likely that it was the
customary method with this class of priests. He retired to a room in his
home where he lay prostrate <span id="fr_986"></span>[3](#fn_979.md) in a
trance while the god or spirit, perched on the ridgepole of the house,
spoke to the unconscious *chilan* below. Then the other priests
assembled, probably in the reception hall of the house, and listened to
the revelation with their faces bowed down to the floor.

Broadly speaking, Maya prophecies fall into four classes:
day-prophecies, year-prophecies, katun-prophecies and special prophecies
of the return of Quetzalcoatl, or Kukulcan as he was called by the Maya.

What we have termed the day-prophecy is more properly a prognostic,
probably the business of the *ah-kinyah*, or diviner, rather than that
of the *chilan*. Every one of the 260 days of the *tzolkin*, or
tonalamatl, is specified as being lucky or unlucky, and many of them are
followed by further prognostications telling whether the day is suitable
for certain undertakings, lucky for certain professions and trades,
auspicious for sowing certain crops, etc. These divinations are probably
the scanty remnant of an extensive hieroglyphic literature exemplified
by the numerous *tzolkin* series found in the Maya picture manuscripts.
Although these almanacs are perhaps the most constant feature of the
various Books of Chilam Balam, no series of this sort occurs in the
Chumayel.

The predictions for the years, however, fall definitely in the field of
genuine prophecy. Two versions of the series of prophecies for the
twenty years of a certain Katun 5 Ahau have come down to us in the books
of Tizimin and Mani. The one in the latter manuscript is entitled
"*Cuceb*," which means squirrel, for some unknown reason. It seems
likely that these were originally the predictions corresponding to the
twenty tuns of this katun, but the versions

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

which we have, ascribed them to the Maya year, or *haab*, of 365 days,
giving the name of the first day of each such year. As in the words of
the minor Hebrew prophets, a surprisingly large proportion of the
predictions are unfavorable. Drought, famine, pestilence are freely
foretold, to say nothing of war, political upheavals, the sacking of
towns and the captivity of the inhabitants. Many misfortunes are
symbolized by the name of the deity which

brought them, and there are valuable references to religious ceremonies.
The latter, coming as they do from a purely native source, are of
especial importance, since practically all our knowledge of the Maya
religion comes from the accounts of the Spanish missionaries who were
obviously prejudiced.

Of all the prophecies, those of the katuns possess the greatest
historical interest. As the Maya commentator himself tells us on page
[78](cbc08.htm#page_78.md) of the Chumayel, they are essentially historical
in character. This appears to be because whatever has occurred in the
past during a certain katun is expected to recur

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

in the future during another katun of the same name. The katun was named
for the day Ahau with its numerical coefficient on which the period
ended. A katun of the same name recurred after approximately 256 years,
consequently at the end of that time history was expected to repeat
itself. The events recounted in the Maya Chronicles found in the Mani,
Tizimin and Chumayel manuscripts offer excellent grounds for believing
that this belief was so strong at times as to actually influence the
course of history. A surprisingly large proportion of the important
upheavals in Maya history appear to have occurred in some katun named
either 4 Ahau or 8 Ahau.

That the katun-prophecies written in European script in the Books of
Chilam Balam correspond closely to their original form, is confirmed by
the account of Father Avendaño who drew his information from the actual
hieroglyphic manuscripts of the independent Itzá. The missionary's
familiarity with such books and his ability to read and expound them to
the Indians indicate that similar hieroglyphic manuscripts were still
available for study in northern Yucatan during the last part of the
Seventeenth Century, for the few days he spent at Tayasal certainly did
not allow sufficient time to acquire the knowledge.

Avendaño's account explains so well the prophecies in the Books of
Chilam Balam that it deserves to be given in full. It is as follows:

"I told them that I wished to speak to them of the old manner of
reckoning which they use, both of days, months and years and of the
ages, and to find out what age the present one might be (since for them
one age consists only of twenty years) and what prophecy there was about
the said year and age; for it is all recorded in certain books of a
quarter of a yard high and about five fingers broad, made of the bark of
trees, folded from one side to the other like screens; each leaf of the
thickness of a Mexican *Real* of eight. These are painted on both sides
with a variety of figures and characters (of the same kind as the
Mexican Indians also used in their old times), which shows not only the
count of the said days, months and years, but also the ages and
prophecies which their idols and images announced to them, or, to speak
more accurately, the devil by means of the worship which they pay to him
in the form of some stones. These ages are thirteen in number; each age
has its separate idol and its priest, with a separate prophecy of its
events. These thirteen ages are divided into thirteen parts, which
divide this kingdom of Yucathan and each age, with its idol, priest and
prophecy, rules in one of these thirteen parts of this land, according
as they have divided it; I do not give the names of the idols, priests
or parts of the land, so as not to cause trouble, although I have made a
treatise <span id="fr_987"></span>[1](#fn_980.md) on these old counts with
all their differences and explanations, so that they may be evident to
all, and the curious may learn them, for if we do not know them, I
affirm that the Indians can betray us face to face." <span
id="fr_988"></span>[2](#fn_981.md)

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

We could hardly ask for a more accurate description of the
katun-prophecies as we find them in the Books of Chilam Balam. About the
only difference is that they are not written in hieroglyphics. All of
them give the name of the katun, the place where it is "established" and
a deity who is called "the face of the katun." The last named, however,
is not described as an idol, but is said to be in the sky, or heavens.
In the Chumayel and Tizimin manuscripts the prophecy is not accompanied
by the name of its corresponding priest, but we find the names of these
priests in the Books of Chilam Balam of Mani and Kaua. Of the prophecies
themselves, more of them are unfavorable than favorable, but we do not
find the complete pessimism which prevails in the year-prophecies.

In the Books of Chilam Balam we find two different series of
katun-prophecies, both covering the thirteen katuns which make up the
"*u kahlay katunob*," i.e. the record of the katuns. They begin with
Katun 11 Ahau, which is called the first katun because it commences with
the day 1 Imix, the first day of the *tzol-kin*, or tonalamatl, and ends
with Katun 13 Ahau. This period of thirteen katuns is the least common
denominator of the 260 day *tzol-kin* and the katun which consists of
7200 days.

The first of these two series is evidently the older, as it takes little
account of the events which occurred after the Spanish Conquest,
although it does mention the actual conquest. Also its language is
somewhat more symbolic than that of the other. The second series of
prophecies was probably compiled at some time later than the second
decade of the Seventeenth Century, judging from some of the historical
allusions which it contains. Most of these allusions, however, date from
before the discovery of America.

The second and later series of prophecies is completely recorded in the
Chumayel, but of the first, only abbreviated versions of the prophecies
for Katuns 11, 4, 2 and 13 Ahau occur. The second series is complete in
the Tizimin manuscript, which also contains the prophecies of the first
series. In the Books of Chilam Balam of Mani, Oxcutzcab and Kaua only
the thirteen prophecies of the first series are to be found.

In both of these series of katun-prophecies the more ancient allusions
are to the history of the Itzá, so far as we are able to identify them.

If Avendaño was the only Spanish writer to concern himself with the
katun-prophecies, such was not the case with the special prophecies
which deal with the return of Quetzalcoatl. These aroused the interest
of most of the early missionaries, since they were believed to foretell
the coming of the Spaniards and the conversion of the Maya to
Christianity. Lizana, Cogolludo and Villagutierre all published Spanish
translations of five of these, and Lizana even went so far as to quote
the Maya text. To anyone who knew them only through these Spanish
translations, they would appear to be inspired by missionary propaganda;
but an examination of the Maya text leads to a conviction

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

of their genuine character, in spite of the fact that any mention of the
name of Quetzalcoatl has been carefully deleted. This personage is,
however, mentioned in the most obscure and guarded terms in a sixth
prophecy by Chilam Balam found in the Chumayel, Tizimin and Mani
manuscripts. <span id="fr_989"></span>[1](#fn_982.md) A seventh prophecy,
also ascribed to Chilam Balam, is thoroughly pagan in character, but
confines its statements to predicting misfortunes of a general character
in Katun 13 Ahau. Its language is archaic, and it approaches more
closely the European idea of poetry than anything else found in Maya
literature. <span id="fr_990"></span>[2](#fn_983.md) Only in an eighth
prophecy, ascribed to Ah Xupan Nauat, do we find a statement obviously
inspired by the event itself. Here the arrival of the white men is
foretold as occurring in the eighth year of Katun 13 Ahau. If Katun 13
Ahau began in 1519, this is altogether too accurate a prediction of
Montejo's landing on the east coast of Yucatan in 1527 to be credited to
a man said to have lived under Hun Uitzil Chac at Uxmal about the
Eleventh Century A.D. <span id="fr_991"></span>[3](#fn_984.md)

The five Maya prophets quoted by Lizana, Cogolludo and Villagutierre
were Ah Kauil Chel, Napuctun, Natzin Yabun Chan, Nahau Pech and Chilam
Balam It is possible that the first two were contemporaries of Ah Xupan
Nauat, as the three names appear to be associated. Nothing is known of
Natzin Yabun Chan to the translator. Nahau Pech is believed to have
lived about four katuns, or eighty years, before the coming of the
whites, which would be about the time of the fall of Mayapan. He was
probably a member of the powerful Pech family which governed the
Province of Ceh Pech at the time of the Conquest. The last and greatest
of the Maya prophets was Chilam Balam. Balam in this case was probably
the man's family name, and as among ourselves the name of his profession
was prefixed to it as a title.

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

Chilam Balam lived at Mani during the reign of Mochan Xiu. <span
id="fr_992"></span>[1](#fn_985.md) In Katun 2 Ahau <span
id="fr_993"></span>[2](#fn_986.md) he predicted that in the Katun 13 Ahau
following, bearded men would come from the east and introduce a new
religion. His prophecy was somewhat more definite than those of his
predecessors, except for the suspicious case already mentioned. This can
be accounted for by rumors of the arrival of the Spaniards in the West
Indies, for we know that fishing canoes were occasionally driven across
to Yucatan by storms. <span id="fr_994"></span>[3](#fn_987.md) What Chilam
Balam had in mind was the return of Quetzalcoatl and his white-robed
priests, but after the Spaniards landed in Yucatan in Katun 13 Ahau
according to schedule, he never ceased to be regarded as the most famous
of the Maya prophets.

We have associated five of these six prophets with the provinces
governed by the Xiu, Pech and Chel families. It is worthy of note that
Montejo and his soldiers received a more friendly reception in these
three provinces than in any other part of Yucatan.

The following table will be useful to the student who wishes to make a
comparison of the various versions of the prophecies found in the Books
of Chilam Balam. <span id="fr_995"></span>[4](#fn_988.md)
