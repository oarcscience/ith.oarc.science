### (THE SECOND CHRONICLE) <span id="fr_664"></span>[1](#fn_661.md)

4 Ahau was the name of the katun when occurred the birth of Pauahs, when
the rulers descended. <span id="fr_665"></span>[2](#fn_662.md)

Thirteen katuns they reigned; thus they were named while they ruled.

4 Ahau was the name of the katun when they descended; the great descent
and the little descent they were called. <span
id="fr_666"></span>[3](#fn_663.md)

Thirteen katuns they reigned. So they were called. While they were
settled, thirteen were their settlements. <span
id="fr_667"></span>[4](#fn_664.md)

4 Ahau was the katun when they sought and discovered Chichen Itzá. There
it was that miraculous things were performed for them by their lords.
Four divisions they were, when the four divisions of the nation, as they
were called, went forth. From Kincolahpeten in the east one division
went forth. From Nacocob in the north one division came forth. But one
division came forth from Holtun Zuyua in the west. One division came
forth from Four-peaked Mountain, Nine Mountains is the name of the
land. <span id="fr_668"></span>[5](#fn_665.md) /

4 Ahau was the katun when the four divisions were called
&lt;together&gt;. The four divisions of the nation, they were called,
when they descended. They became lords when they descended upon Chichen
Itzá. The Itzá were they then called.

Thirteen katuns they ruled, and then came the treachery by Hunac Ceel.
Their town was abandoned and they went into the heart of the forest to
Tan-xuluc-mul, <span id="fr_669"></span>[1](#fn_666.md) as it is called.

4 Ahau was the katun when their souls cried out!

Thirteen katuns they ruled in their misery!

8 Ahau was the katun when occurred the arrival of the remainder of the
Itzá, as they were called. They arrived, and there their reign endured
in Chakanputun.

13 Ahau was the katun when they founded the town of Mayapan, the Maya
men, as they were called.

8 Ahau was when their town was abandoned and they were scattered
throughout the entire district. In the sixth katun after they were
dispersed, then they ceased to be called Maya. <span

11 Ahau was the name of the katun when the Maya men ceased to be called
Maya. They were called Christians; their entire province &lt;became
subject&gt; to St. Peter and the reigning King &lt;of Spain&gt;. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_661"></span>[139:1](cbc25.htm#fr_664.md) The following is a
chant or song rather than an actual chronicle, and the events recorded
are not set in chronological order. Nevertheless it has usually been
included with the Maya chronicles because its content is largely
historical. It emphasizes the fact already noted, that most of the
historical events recorded by the Maya occurred either in a Katun 4 Ahau
or a Katun 8 Ahau. Besides the translations already cited. Tozzer has
also translated this passage (Tozzer 1920, p. 131).

<span id="fn_662"></span>[139:2](cbc25.htm#fr_665.md) Part of the text here
is corrupt: *paua haen cuh u yahauoob*, and has been changed to *pauah
emci u yahauoob*, to obtain the reading given above. For the Pauah or
Pauahtun, see page 110, note  [4](cbc16.htm#fn_413.md). Chichen Itzá was
once ruled by Chac-xib-chac, a name associated with Pauahtun. *Cf.* page
[67](cbc07.htm#page_67.md).

Mr. T. A. Willard has made a study of this important passage and
translates it: "In 4 Ahau, the name of the katun, were born (again)
those who had been destroyed by water (i.e. the flood or the rain)." The
word *cuh* may be intended for *cah*, the town which was destroyed; *pa*
could mean to destroy, and *ha*, water, either flood or rain. We know
that the old Maya era with which the Initial Series dates began was a
day 4 Ahau, and we have seen both from the creation story in Chapter X
and from page 74 of the Dresden Codex that according to the Maya the
world was once destroyed by water.

<span id="fn_663"></span>[139:3](cbc25.htm#fr_666.md) "In former times they
called the East *Cenial* (*¢e-emal*), the Little Descent, and the West
*Nohenial* (*noh-emal*), the Great Descent. The reason they give for
this is that on the east of this land a few people descended, and on the
west a great many; and with that syllable they understand little or
much, to the east and the west; and that few people came from one
direction and many from another." Lizana 1893, ff. 3 and 4, apud Brinton
1882, page 182.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[139:4](cbc25.htm#fr_667.md) There was a tradition
that Yucatan was divided into thirteen provinces or divisions in ancient
times. *Cf.* [Avendaño](errata.htm#2.md) apud Appendix D.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[139:5](cbc25.htm#fr_668.md) Like the typical
Nahua tribe, the Maya nation was composed of four main divisions. As we
shall see in the next chronicle, when Mayapan was destroyed, the
head-chief Tutul Xiu went out with his chiefs and with the "four
divisions of the nation." It is not impossible that the system was a
Nahua innovation. Here it is suggested that this method of organization
was the result of the amalgamation of four different peoples into one
nation.

The places of origin are not fully identified. We have discussed Zuyua
on page 88, note  [1](cbc14.htm#fn_234.md). *Holtun* may mean a stone gate.
For "Nine Mountains, see page 64, note  [3](cbc06.htm#fn_37.md).
Kincolah-peten is mentioned on page 132.

<span id="fn_666"></span>[140:1](cbc25.htm#fr_669.md) Avendaño reports a
pond named Tan-xuluc-mul a short distance west of Lake Peten. Above it
towered a high hill crowned by a ruined building in which a noted idol
was said to be worshipped. This would indicate that some of the Itzá at
least migrated to Tayasal at this time (Means 1917, p. 128).

<span id="fn_667"></span>[140:2](cbc25.htm#fr_670.md) The reference here is
to the destruction of Mayapan in Katun 8 Ahau. Counting this katun as
the first, 11 Ahau, the katun of the actual Spanish conquest, was the
sixth.

<span id="fn_668"></span>[140:3](cbc25.htm#fr_671.md) R. B. Weitzel
considers the preceding a presentation of the Nahua penetration of the
peninsula of Yucatan, and if we are to consider the so-called arrival of
Kukulcan (perhaps the introduction of the Quetzalcoatl cult) a Nahua
intrusion, some support for this opinion will be found in the prophecy
for Katun 4 Ahau on page [161](cbc27.htm#page_161.md).

His suggestion that a folk-song of this kind is the original form of a
Maya chronicle is not unreasonable. It is indeed possible that the other
chronicles were later compilations made from the material found in such
songs. The prophecies would also furnish historical data. Such a
hypothesis would explain the long sequences of katuns in the chronicles
for which there are no historical entries (Weitzel 1931, p. 323).
