### Footnotes

<span id="fn_219"></span>[84:4](cbc11.htm#fr_220.md) It is generally agreed
that Katun 11 Ahau began some time during the last half of the fourth
decade of the Sixteenth Century. There was, however, a school of Maya
writers during the Eighteenth Century who taught that the katun was
composed of 24 years of 365 days each. They believed that a certain
Katun 4 Ahau ended in 1752; and counting back to Katun 11 Ahau by their
assumed katuns of 24 years, they came to the conclusion that it began in
a year 10 Cauac which fell in 1512.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[84:5](cbc11.htm#fr_221.md) Cortez landed in
Cozumel in 1519.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[84:6](cbc11.htm#fr_222.md) Santiago was a suburb
of Merida occupied by the Nahua allies of the Spaniards (Cogolludo Bk. 7
Chap. 4).

<span id="fn_222"></span>[84:7](cbc11.htm#fr_223.md) It is significant to
note that the Maya still preserved the idea of a night-count at this
late date.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[85:1](cbc11.htm#fr_224.md) The uinal was the Maya
month of twenty days.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[85:2](cbc11.htm#fr_226.md) Literally Little
Yaxkin. Yaxkin is the usual name of this uinal.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[85:3](cbc11.htm#fr_227.md) The ear is left on the
stalk, which is bent double so that the husk will completely shed the
rain. Until the fall rains are over, the corn is said to keep better in
this manner than in the granary.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[85:4](cbc11.htm#fr_225.md) Probably due to the
smoke from the fields which are burned over at this time.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[85:5](cbc11.htm#fr_228.md) Written in a different
hand. The rest of the page is blank.
