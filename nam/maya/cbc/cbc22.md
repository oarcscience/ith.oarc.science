### (AN INCANTATION)

Strung end to end are the precious stones, the red precious stones,
representing the substance of heaven, the moisture of heaven. <span
id="fr_612"></span>[3](#fn_609.md)

The form in which you created the sun, &lt;in which&gt; you created the
earth! The form of the moisture of heaven, the substance of heaven, the
yellow blossom <span id="fr_613"></span>[4](#fn_610.md) of heaven! How did
I create your sun? &lt;How did I&gt; create your moon? How did I create
your precious stones? I created you. When you were sprinkled with water,
you remembered the force of the sun. Then when the message was sent to
you ... Under cover I created you, I set you &lt;where you are&gt;. From
time to time I take &lt;you&gt;, I perceive your vigor because of your
father. You await ... that I may take away ... from your mouth. They are
the yellow precious stones. So runs its course as he records <span
id="fr_614"></span>[5](#fn_611.md) it. These are the rulers <span
id="fr_615"></span>[6](#fn_612.md) which have been set in order. Go and
read it and you will understand it. <span
id="fr_616"></span>[7](#fn_613.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_607"></span>[131:1](cbc21.htm#fr_610.md) The text reads *un
trus nicte*. *Nicte* is a flower, usually the Plumeria. *Trus*, since it
contains an r is probably a distorted Spanish word. The translation
given here is derived from a comparison of the use of the expression on
p. 118 of B.L.C. No. 43 and that of a similar Maya phrase, *oxlahun tzuc
nicte* on page 174 of the same manuscript. The translator is inclined to
associate this expression with the love-charm described by Aguilar
(Aguilar 1892, p. 84; translated in Saville 1921, p. 207).

<span id="fn_608"></span>[131:2](cbc21.htm#fr_611.md) Maya, *pectzil*. This
word usually means news or what is said of some one. Here something
concrete appears to be intended, and the word has been divided into its
component parts, *pec* and *tzil*, which give a very different meaning.

<span id="fn_609"></span>[131:3](cbc22.htm#fr_612.md) Maya: *kab caan itz
caan*. When asked who he was, Itzamat-ul, a deified ruler of Izamal,
replied: "*Itz en caan, itz en muyal*." This has been translated: "*Yo
soy el rocío, ó sustancia del cielo y nubes*" (Cogolludo 1868, Book 4,
chap. 8).

<span id="fn_610"></span>[131:4](cbc22.htm#fr_613.md) *Cf.* p. 65, note
 [9](cbc06.htm#fn_52.md).

<span id="fn_611"></span>[131:5](cbc22.htm#fr_614.md) To obtain this
meaning *¢olic* (he skins it) has been changed to *tzolic* (he records
it).

<span id="fn_612"></span>[131:6](cbc22.htm#fr_615) Ahau (ruler.md) is the
day for which the katun is named.

<span id="fn_613"></span>[131:7](cbc22.htm#fr_616.md) This very difficult
passage differs in vocabulary and style from the rest of the MS. The
spaces left in the text indicate that the Eighteenth Century compiler
copied it from a defective original. Its unique style resembles that of
Gates' Ritual of the Bacabs, which was probably written in eastern
Yucatan, judging from a comparison of the latter with the Titulos de
Ebtun. The translator is familiar only with a few extracts from the
Ritual of the Bacabs, but it is possible that the above passage has been
copied from that manuscript. *Cf.* Tozzer 1921, p. 196. We suggest that
this is an invocation to the growing corn. Possibly the last three
sentences refer to the following chapter.
