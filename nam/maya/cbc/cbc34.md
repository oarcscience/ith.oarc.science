# APPENDIX E

### TRADITIONS OF CASTE AND CHIEFTAINSHIP AMONG THE MAYA

Although chieftainship in Yucatan was not always hereditary in the
strictest sense of the word, it was only considered legitimate when
confined to certain families, and a proper rank was most essential.
Apparently it was not necessary to have established this social position
in the particular locality in question, for after the fall of Mayapan
about the middle of the Fifteenth Century when the Ah Canuls, the
so-called Mexican mercenaries at the capital, were allowed to settle in
western Yucatan, they were promptly accepted as chiefs by the people
living in that region. As we are told in the Calkini chronicle, "they
were not pretenders to chieftainship nor were they provokers of
discord." They were legitimate chiefs, even though they had been driven
by revolution from the capital which had been their home for centuries.
So "they began to love the towns and the local chiefs, and they were
also loved by the towns there where my great ancestor governed
men." <span id="fr_996"></span>[1](#fn_989.md)

Maya society, broadly speaking, was divided into two classes, nobles and
commoners. The former were called *almehen*, and the latter, *mazeual*.
*Al* designates the son of a woman and *mehen* a man's son. Consequently
the word *almehen* means one who had a father and a mother, both
presumably persons of distinction. Oddly enough, the term parallels its
Spanish equivalent, *hidalgo*, which is the abbreviation of *hijo de
algo*, the son of somebody. *Mazeual* was a foreign word borrowed from
the Toltec intruders into Yucatan. In the Nahuatl language as well as in
Maya it meant the ordinary agricultural laborer who was not eligible to
political office. The Maya language itself bears frequent evidence of
static social conditions in spite of wars and political revolutions. For
example, *pic-¢acab* (literally innumerable generations) is defined in
the Sixteenth Century Motul Dictionary as: "by inheritance from one's
ancestors, by caste, by lineage, by family or from far back." An example
is given which is translated: "By caste, by lineage, by inheritance from
his ancestors or from far back, the chieftainship comes to Juan, or he
comes to be a farmer," etc. <span id="fr_997"></span>[2](#fn_990.md) So in
spite of certain communistic aspects of Maya society, it was anything
but democratic.

From the time of the fall of Mayapan down to the Spanish Conquest we
find two classes of chieftains in Yucatan, the *halach-uinic* and the
*batab*. The former, literally the real man, was the governor, or
head-chief, of a district, and the latter was the local municipal
executive officer. Halach-uinic has usually been translated as governor
and *batab* as cacique or chief. The objection

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

to calling the former a governor is that in Spanish colonial times the
local *batab* was given the title of Gobernador and frequently appears
as such in official documents. After the Conquest of course the native
office of *halach-uinic* disappeared. Consequently in the present work
*batab* has been rendered as "chief" and *halach-uinic*, as
"head-chief." There was probably also a religious aspect to the office
of *halach-uinic* judging by the definition of the term given by the
Motul Dictionary: "*Obispo, oydor, governador, o comissario; es nombre
para estas dignidades y otras semejantes*." Another term, *ahau*, was
applied to some of the head-chiefs of the various territorial divisions
of Yucatan. In the present work this has been translated as "ruler,"
although we can not be certain as to just what it implied. The Motul
Dictionary defines ahau as "king, emperor, monarch, prince or great
lord," and in colonial times it was the Maya title of the King of Spain.
We know that before the Conquest the head-chiefs of three of the
so-called provinces <span id="fr_998"></span>[1](#fn_991.md) were called
Ahau Pech, Ahau Chel and Ahau Cocom. <span
id="fr_999"></span>[2](#fn_992.md) Strangely enough we nowhere find the
title, Ahau, given to any of the Xiu rulers, the *halach-uinics* <span
id="fr_1000"></span>[3](#fn_993.md) of the Province of Mani, although they
seem to have been the most powerful in Yucatan at the time of the
Spanish Conquest. In some provinces there may have been more than one
head-chief, <span id="fr_1001"></span>[4](#fn_994.md) while in others we
find only a loose confederation of local *batabs*. <span
id="fr_1002"></span>[5](#fn_995.md)

Landa would have us believe that the office of head-chief was
hereditary. "If when the lord died there were no sons &lt;old enough&gt;
to rule and if he had brothers, the eldest of the brothers governed or
else the one who was most at liberty &lt;to do so&gt;. These instructed
the heir in their usages and festivals in view of the time when he
should become a man; and even when the heir was &lt;old enough&gt; to
govern, these brothers continued in command all during their lives. If
there were no brothers, the priests and leading people chose a man who
was capable." <span id="fr_1003"></span>[6](#fn_996.md) It is difficult to
reconcile this account with what we find to have been the actual
practise. In that unique document, the Xiu family tree, <span
id="fr_1004"></span>[7](#fn_997.md) which covers the period from the
destruction of Mayapan down to the Spanish Conquest, we find that during
the last two generations the office of *halach-uinic* passed through two
different branches of the Xiu family, and not from father to son nor
even from brother to brother. We know that the grandfather of the famous
interpreter, Gaspar Antonio Chi, was the Xiu *halach-uinic* who was
murdered at Otzmal by Nachi Cocom; and he appears in the Xiu family tree
as Ah <u>¢</u>ulub Xiu, although he was also known as Ah

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

\[paragraph continues\] <u>¢</u>un Xiu. <span
id="fr_1005"></span>[1](#fn_998.md) He had two sons and two younger
brothers, one of whom survived him, but his successor, christened
Francisco de Montejo Xiu, was the second son of his second cousin, Ah
Ziyah Xiu, who also met his death at Otzmal.

The head-chief of the Province of Ceh Pech always belonged to the Pech
family, and in Ah Kin Chel the Chel family governed. In Zotuta the Cocom
family was supreme, while in the Provinces of the Cupuls and of Cochuah
we find members of the Cupul and Cochuah families in power. In addition
to being noble, such families enjoyed the further distinction of being
called "the first lineage" in the provinces in which they were supreme.
In Ceh Pech, for example, Nakuk Pech referred to himself and his
relatives as belonging to the "first lineage," <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[2](#fn_999.md) and the families of the head-chief s of
other provinces probably enjoyed a similar distinction. We can not be
certain of the method employed for determining the succession among the
various members of the family when the *halach-uinic* died. It may have
been hereditary, as explained by Landa, in some families, while in
others it was probably a matter of personal prestige.

So far as we can learn, the powers of the *halach-uinic* appear to have
been very broad. Certainly he took the lead in formulating both foreign
and domestic policy, but we get the general impression that he had an
advisory council composed of the more important batabs and priests. The
towns of his territory paid him tribute in the form of grain, fowls,
honey, game, cotton cloth, precious stones and sometimes even slaves. We
find no mention of gold in this connection, probably because gold was
not produced in Yucatan. The tribute does not seem to have been onerous,
and under the Xius of Mani it is said to have been very light, little
more than a matter of form in fact. In time of war it was obligatory for
each town to furnish the quota of fighting men demanded by the
head-chief. The maritime provinces often fought to prevent outsiders
from fishing or gathering salt on their coasts, and there were many
petty wars over boundary disputes. <span
id="fr_1007"></span>[3](#fn_1000.md)

"The lords were absolute in command, and what they ordered was carried
out without fail. They had in the towns caciques &lt;*batabs*&gt; or a
person of rank <span id="fr_1008"></span>[4](#fn_1001.md) to listen to
lawsuits and public demands. He received the litigants or negotiators,
and when the case was heard, if the matter was a serious one, he
discussed it with the lord. To settle it, other officials were appointed
who were like lawyers and alguaciles, <span
id="fr_1009"></span>[5](#fn_1002.md) and they always took part in the
presence of the judges. The latter and the lords could receive
gratuities from both parties." <span id="fr_1010"></span>[6](#fn_1003.md)

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

In some cases the *halach-uinic* himself acted as judge. <span
id="fr_1011"></span>[1](#fn_1004.md)

The *batab*, or local chief, was appointed by the *halach-uinic*, <span
id="fr_1012"></span>[2](#fn_1005.md) who frequently gave the position to
one of his own family connections. Other noble families were by no means
excluded, but we find a considerable proportion of the local chiefs
belonging to the "first lineage" in the Provinces of Ceh Pech, Zotuta
and Cupul. Landa tells us that at the death of the *batab* his son was
appointed in his place by the head-chief, <span
id="fr_1013"></span>[3](#fn_1006.md) if he was found suitable for the
position. Nevertheless we also find the capable sons of local chiefs
appointed to govern other towns during their fathers' lifetime. <span
id="fr_1014"></span>[4](#fn_1007.md)

The *batab* was the local magistrate and executive. He took an important
part in the conduct of war, <span id="fr_1015"></span>[5](#fn_1008.md)
although there was also a war-chief called the *nacom*. <span
id="fr_1016"></span>[6](#fn_1009.md) The *batab's* power could hardly have
been arbitrary, for he was subject to influence and probably even
pressure at times from three different quarters. Certainly he had to
carry out the orders of the *halach-uinic* who had appointed him. Then
he was obliged to cooperate with the local priest, who was the diviner
and prophet and "whom they (the people) obeyed, though not so much as
they did the *batabs*." <span id="fr_1017"></span>[7](#fn_1010.md)
Furthermore we learn that he had two or three advisers called
*ah-cuch-cab* who could veto his decisions in the village council. <span
id="fr_1018"></span>[8](#fn_1011.md) It is probable that these last
represented the interests of the wealthier members of the community. As
a matter of practise these things did not always work out according to
rule. Sometimes the batab was in a position where he could afford to pay
little attention to the *halach-uinic*, as in some parts of the Province
of the Cupuls, and in other cases he was able to override the objections
of the town-council. His government was decidedly of a paternal
character. Besides presiding at the local council and holding court, he
also gave directions for repairing the houses of individual citizens as
well as the municipal buildings, preparing the fields for cultivation
and planting crops at such times as the priest declared proper. <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[9](#fn_1012.md)

As to the remuneration of the *batabs*, we are told that "they did not
pay them any tribute; they only supported them from what they
manufactured and sowed." <span id="fr_1020"></span>[10](#fn_1013.md) This
information is supplemented by the decrees of the Spanish governors of
Yucatan in confirmation of certain old rights and privileges granted in
perpetuity to a number of native families whose members had aided in the
Conquest and reorganization of the country. Adjoining the town

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

of Oxkutzcab was a village called Yaxa, the chief of which was favored
by such a grant. In the year 1608 we find the official Protector of the
Indians petitioning the Governor to confirm the rights of Don Pedro Xiu,
a descendant of the original grantee. The grant compelled local
*gobernador* and *alcaldes* of Yaxa to see to it that the village
cultivated each year a cornfield for the support of Don Pedro Xiu and
his wife, supplied each week a man and a woman for domestic service, and
repaired the buildings comprising the Xiu residence as often as it might
be needed. <span id="fr_1021"></span>[1](#fn_1014.md) The measure was a
wise one on the part of the Spanish government, calculated to preserve
the loyalty of the more influential Maya families, and it continued in
force down to the end of the colonial period.

New light is cast on the traditions of caste and chieftainship among the
Maya by the chapter in the Chumayel which the translator has entitled
"The Interrogation of the Chiefs." This formality took place at the
beginning of each katun <span id="fr_1022"></span>[2](#fn_1015.md) and was
a sort of civil service examination conducted by the *halach-uinic* with
the object of weeding out from the ranks of legitimate chieftainship the
upstarts, pretenders and those who had obtained office under false
pretenses. Many of the prescribed questions and answers are trivial, and
the questionnaire which has come down to us contains references to
horses, which shows us that it had been altered a little to correspond
to the new conditions since the Spanish Conquest. Nevertheless three
important facts are brought out in this chapter. The first is that there
was a firmly established tradition of such an examination; the second,
that the proof of legitimacy was considered to be certain knowledge
supposed to have been handed down from father to son in families
eligible to chieftainship; the third, that this occult knowledge was
known as the "language of Zuyua."

The name Zuyua is inseparably connected with the Toltec penetration of
Yucatan, which left a number of Nahuatl words in the Maya language. Many
such words are those associated with ideas of political power and social
standing. The Xius believed that they had come from a place called West
Zuyua, <span id="fr_1023"></span>[3](#fn_1016.md) and Brinton has
identified Zuyua with the Mexican Zuiven, "the name of the uppermost
heaven, the abode of the Creator, Hometecutli, the father of
Quetzalcoatl, and the place of his first birth as a divinity." <span
id="fr_1024"></span>[4](#fn_1017.md)

The foregoing indicates that only members of those families in which
certain Toltec traditions had been handed down were eligible to
chieftainship. It is uncertain whether such families were actually of
Mexican descent, but confirmation of the long-standing Nahua
affiliations of the ruling families is found in Landa's account of the
annual festival in honor of Kukulcan, or Quetzalcoatl, at Mani, the
capital of the Province of the Xius. This festival

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

had been celebrated at Mayapan until the destruction of that city, and
it was peculiarly the affair of the chiefs and priests who had assembled
from the various parts of the country. <span
id="fr_1025"></span>[1](#fn_1018.md) The other provinces contributed each
year in turn four or five feather banners which played an important part
in the ceremonies, and the various *halach-uinics*, so frequently at war
with one another, appear for the time being to have forgotten their
feuds and enmities. During the last five days of the month of Xul
everything was as it had been when the entire country was united under
the rule of Mayapan.

To account for these Toltec traditions among the ruling families we must
go back to the time of the introduction of the worship of Kukulcan into
Yucatan. The identity of the Maya Kukulcan with the Mexican Quetzalcoatl
and the Mexican origin of the worship of this culture-hero have been
well established. <span id="fr_1026"></span>[2](#fn_1019.md)

If a foreign religion was introduced into the country from Mexico, we
should first look for the families of the descendants of the people who
introduced it, although, of course, it does not necessarily follow that
any of them survived. In this connection our attention is drawn first to
the Xiu family in whose capital we have seen the festival for Kukulcan
still being celebrated down to the time of the Spanish Conquest. We have
already noted that they themselves believed that they had come from a
place called West Zuyua, a name derived from Mexican mythology. Landa
tells us that when they arrived in Yucatan, their only weapon was the
dart and throwing-stick, <span id="fr_1027"></span>[3](#fn_1020.md) or
*atlatl*, which points strongly to a Nahua origin. Elsewhere we read of
the town of Mama near Mani that "they were subject to a lord whom they
called Tutul Xiu, a Mexican name, who, they say, was a foreigner. He
came from the west, and having come to this province the leading people
raised him with common consent to be their king." <span
id="fr_1028"></span>[4](#fn_1021.md) If further confirmation of the Mexican
origin of this family were needed, we might cite the Xiu family
tree, <span id="fr_1029"></span>[5](#fn_1022.md) according to which two
members of the family have the name or title of Ah Cuat Xiu. *Cuat* is
simply another form of the Nahuatl *coatl* which means serpent.

If we search for Nahuatl names or titles among the other leading
families of Yucatan, we find mention three times in the Chronicle of
Nakuk Pech of the name, Ah Cuat Cocom, <span
id="fr_1030"></span>[6](#fn_1023.md) he may have been related to Nachi
Cocom who

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

was the *halach-uinic* at Zotuta. The Cocom family was at one time the
most powerful in Yucatan, and even after the destruction of Mayapan they
continued to play an important part in the history of the country. Their
history goes back to the founding of Mayapan in the Tenth Century A.D.
Of this city Landa tells us that after settling Chichen Itzá--

"Kukulcan again founded another city by arrangement with the native
lords of the land, in which he and they should live and where all the
affairs and business should be conducted ... and they surrounded it with
a very broad wall of dry stone of about half a quarter of a league,
leaving only two narrow gates. The wall was not very high. Within this
they constructed their temples ... and the houses for the lords, among
whom he divided the entire country, giving towns to each according to
the antiquity of his lineage and his personal importance. Kukulcan ...
called it Mayapan, which means the standard of the Maya . . .

"This Kukulcan lived with the lords for some years in that city, and
leaving them in all peace and friendship he returned by the same road to
Mexico ... After the departure of Kukulcan the lords agreed in order to
perpetuate the government that the house of the Cocoms should have the
chief command, either because it was the oldest or richest, or because
its head was at that time the most valorous man." <span
id="fr_1031"></span>[1](#fn_1024.md)

In one of the Mexican sources we read that--

"The people of Yucatan venerated and reverenced this God, Quetzalcoatl,
and called him Kulkulcan, and said he arrived there from the west ...
They said of him that from him descended the Kings of Yucatan whom they
call Cocoms, which means *Oidores*." <span
id="fr_1032"></span>[2](#fn_1025.md)

Descent from a Nahua culture-hero would be ascribed to a Mexican family
rather than to one of Maya origin.

A third important Toltec family, probably a later arrival than the Xius
and Cocoms, was that of the Ah Canuls, the so-called Mexican
mercenaries <span id="fr_1033"></span>[3](#fn_1026.md) whom we have already
discussed.

Consequently the joint government at Mayapan appears to have consisted
of two rival Mexican factions, Cocoms and Xius, <span
id="fr_1034"></span>[4](#fn_1027.md) the former being supported by a third
element of similar origin, the Ah Canuls. By the time of the fall of
Mayapan, however, they were probably Mexican only by tradition, for the
Spanish [conquerors](errata.htm#5.md) found them speaking only Maya some
sixty years later.

A question arises as to the origin of the other ruling families of the
various provinces, such as the Pechs, Chels, Cupuls and Cochuahs, to
mention only those of whose hereditary standing we have some
information. At some unspecified time, probably after the destruction of
Mayapan, a certain Noh-cabal

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Pech established his capital at Motul, and we
are told that he was "a near relative of the great lord at
Mayapan." <span id="fr_1035"></span>[1](#fn_1028.md) The Chel family was
descended from Mo-Chel, the noble son-in-law of one of the principal
priests at Mayapan. He is said to have foreseen the destruction of the
capital, and he fled with some followers to Tecoh near Izamal, where he
established an independent state, taking the title of Ah Kin (the
priest) Chel. <span id="fr_1036"></span>[2](#fn_1029.md) We know little of
the history of the others, but their status as independent rulers dated
only from the fall of Mayapan about the middle of the Fifteenth Century.
No doubt most of those who were not of Toltec origin were descended from
the old Yucatecan ruling class, of whom we have practically no
knowledge. There were, however, other intruders into the country besides
the Toltecs. Both in the proper names and in the vocabulary of Yucatan
we find distinct traces of people from the south who spoke a language
very similar to what we know of the Chol. This is one of the other
languages of the great Maya stock, and while it much resembles the Maya
of Yucatan in some respects, it has a different consonantal system. At
least two Maya families <span id="fr_1037"></span>[3](#fn_1030.md) had such
foreign names, and there were probably others.

During the hegemony of Mayapan these "lords" lived at the capital and
each governed his own district from there. Their residences were within
the walled enclosure, but outside the walls each head-chief had a house
where petitioners from his own district were received when they came to
the capital. This house was in charge of a personal representative
called the *caluac* who made requisitions on the towns of the district
for food, clothing and anything else needed for the maintenance of the
household of his master. <span id="fr_1038"></span>[4](#fn_1031.md)

A comparison of the Maya sources cited in this paper with Zurita's
account <span id="fr_1039"></span>[5](#fn_1032.md) of the political
institutions of Mexico leads to the conclusion that the central
government at Mayapan corresponded in many respects to the Nahua
pattern. At the time of the revolution which destroyed the city we are
told that "the halach-uinic Tutul &lt;Xiu&gt; departed with the chiefs
of the town and of the four districts or divisions of the town," <span
id="fr_1040"></span>[6](#fn_1033.md) and we are reminded of the four main
divisions of the Aztec and Tlaxcalan states. The four chiefs of these
divisions were especially concerned with the distribution of tribute
from subject peoples, and we find an echo of this function in the
present work when we read: "At Tikuch arrived the tribute of the four
men." <span id="fr_1041"></span>[7](#fn_1034.md) The resemblance is less
apparent in the local government of the Yucatecan towns and villages.
Here the administration of the *batab*, assisted by the *ah-cuch-cags*
and *ah-kulels* probably followed the ancient traditions of Yucatan.

<span id="fn_1019"></span>[193:2](cbc34.htm#fr_1026.md) Seler (1902, p.
674) has assembled and correlated the evidence on this point. The first
Spanish settlers in Yucatan also tell us: "It is the opinion among the
Indians that with the Itzá who settled at Chichen Itzá there came a
great lord named Kukulcan . . . And they say that he entered &lt;the
country&gt; from the western side . . . and that after his return he was
held in Mexico to be one of their gods and called Quetzalcoatl; in
Yucatan they also consider him to be a god because of his great public
spirit" (Landa 1928, pp. 62-64).

Mayapan over all northern Yucatan. It is probable that prior to 1200
A.D. Chichen Itzá was the more powerful of the two cities. *Cf*.

be an archaic participial form meaning "one who listens with attention."
