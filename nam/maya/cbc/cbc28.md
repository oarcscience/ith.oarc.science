### (THE LAST JUDGMENT) <span id="fr_871"></span>[3](#fn_865.md)

The judgment of God for the righteous: "Come unto me ye blessed of my
Father, inherit the eternal glory prepared by my Father for you since
the beginning of the world. You have kept my commandments; you have done
penance when you sinned against me. Therefore come ye to heaven." <span
id="fr_872"></span>[4](#fn_866.md) Then he turns his gaze upon the sinners
with whom he is angered. "Depart from me ye accursed of my Father into
the eternal fire of hell which is prepared for the Devil by my Father.
You have despised me, your Father, me, your Redeemer. You have despised
my commandments with the commandment of the Devil. Go ye therefore with
him to eternal misery." Then the wicked men shall go to hell, but the
good men shall go to Heaven with our Father, God, to eternal glory
comparable to the glory of Jehoshaphat. There are three men, the true
servants of God, well beloved of God. Elias, and Methuselah and Enoch
are their names; they are living to this day. They are ordained by God
to guard his seats. Our Lord God shall call a reckoning in a valley in
the land, a great open savannah. There he shall sit upon his throne. The
entire world shall assemble &lt;there&gt;. The sheep shall be set apart;
they shall be on his right hand. The goats shall be set apart; they
shall be on his left hand. On his left shall be the wicked men; those
who have not fulfilled all the commandments of God shall then go to the
eternal misery of hell, sunk in the earth, oppressed by &lt;the Sins&gt;
of our first parents. <span id="fr_873"></span>[5](#fn_867.md) But the

good men who have fulfilled the commandments of God shall be at the
right hand of the great Lord God. "Come, ye men blessed of my Father and
take the kingdom prepared for you since the beginning of the world."
Then a great cloud shall gather, black in the sky, <span

down to the face of the earth. Like a trumpet is the joyful song of the
Angels. It is beautiful beyond comparison. The true God shall arise, the
Lord of heaven and earth.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_865"></span>[163:3](cbc28.htm#fr_871.md) The following is an
account of the Christian Last Judgment apparently written by a Spanish
missionary. The text seems to adhere too closely to the rules laid down
by the Spanish writers on Maya grammar for it to have been written by an
Indian. Nevertheless it is written in excellent Maya and probably dates
from the Seventeenth Century. It will be of interest to compare this
text with the "*Carta de los Diez Caciques*" written in 1567 and
published by Juan Martinez in his edition of the Motul Dictionary. The
latter is formal but extremely idiomatic. Our present text, although we
do not know the date when it was written originally, shows that the Maya
idiom had changed in its forms of expression since the middle of the
Sixteenth Century.

The present translator has availed himself freely of Sr. Martinez'
Spanish translation of this passage (Martinez 1928, pp. 137-138).

<span id="fn_867"></span>[163:5](cbc28.htm#fr_873.md) Alternative
translation: told of by our first parents (Adam and Eve).

<span id="fn_868"></span>[164:1](cbc28.htm#fr_874.md) Possible alternative
translation: Then a great cloud of stars shall gather. *Cf.* Revelation
14.14: "And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one
sat like unto the Son of man."
