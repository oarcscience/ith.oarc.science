### SEC. IX. CHRONOLOGICAL MONUMENTS OF YUCATAN. FOUNDATION OF THE KINGDOM OF SOTUTA. ORIGIN OF THE CHELS. THE THREE PRINCIPAL KINGDOMS OF YUCATAN.

According to the reckoning of the Indians it has been 120 years since
the abandonment of Mayapán. On the site of that city are to be found
seven or eight stones each ten feet in height, round on one side, well
carved and bearing several lines of the characters they use, so worn
away by the water as to be unreadable, although they are thought to be a
monument of the foundation and destruction of the city. There are others
like them at Zilán, a town on the coast, except that they are
taller. <span id="fr_11"></span>[\*](#fn_11.md) The natives being asked
what they

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

were, answered that it was the custom to set up one of these stones
every twenty years, that being the number by which they reckon their
periods. This however seems to be without warrant, for in that event
there must have been many others; besides that there are none of them in
any other places than Mayapán and Zilán.

The most important thing that the chiefs who stripped Mayapán took away
to their own countries were the books of their sciences, for they were
always very subject to the counsels of their priests, for which reason
there are so many temples in those provinces.

That son of Cocom who had escaped death through being away on a trading
expedition to the Ulna country, which is beyond the city of Salamanca,
on hearing of his father's death and the destruction of the city,
returned in haste and gathered his relatives and vassals; they settled
in a site which he called **Tibulon**, meaning 'we have been played
with.' <span id="fr_12"></span>[†](#fn_12.md) They built many other towns
in those forests, and many families have sprung from these Cocoms. The
province where this chief ruled was called **Sututa**.

The lords of Mayapán took no vengeance on those Mexicans who gave aid to
Cocom, seeing that they had been influenced by the governor of the
country, and since they were strangers. They therefore left them
undisturbed, granting them leave to settle in a place apart, or else to
leave the country; in staying, however, they were not to intermarry with
the natives, but only among themselves. These decided to remain in
Yucatan and not return to the lagoons and mosquitos of Tabasco, and so
settled in the province of Canul, which was assigned them, and where
they remained until the second Spanish wars.

They say that among the twelve priests of Mayapán was one of great
wisdom who had an only daughter, whom he had married to a young nobleman
named **Ah-Chel**. This one had sons who were called the same as their
father, according to the custom of the country. They say that this
priest predicted the fall of the city to his son-in-law; they tell that
on the broad part of his arm the old priest inscribed certain characters
of great import in their estimation. With this distinction conferred on
him he went to the coast and established a settlement at Tikoch, a great
number of people following him. Thus arose the renowned families of the
Chels, who peopled the most famous province of Yucatan, which they named
after themselves the province of **Ahkin-Chel** Here was Izamal, where
the Chels resided; and they multiplied in Yucatan until the coming of
the admiral Montejo.

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

Between these great princely houses of the Cocoms, Xius and Chels there
was a constant feud and enmity, which still continues even though they
have become Christians. The Cocoms call the Xius strangers and traitors,
murdering their natural lord and plundering his possessions. The Xius
say they are as good as the others, as ancient and as noble; that they
were not traitors but liberators, having slain a tyrant. The Chel said
that he was as good as the others in lineage, being the descendant of
the most renowned priest in Mayapán; that as to himself he was greater
than they, because he had known how to make himself as much a lord as
they were. The quarrel extended even to their food supply, for the Chel,
living on the coast, would not give fish or salt to the Cocom, making
him go a long distance for it; and the Cocom would not permit the Chel
to take any game or fruits.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_11"></span>[16:\*](ybac13.htm#fr_11.md) The date at Mayapán
has been read as **katun 10 Ahau**, meaning that the event took place in
the 20-year period preceding Oct. 7, 928, or else again in 1185 or 1441.
It could hardly be the latter, since Mayapán had just previously been
destroyed, as correctly stated by Landa; if the earlier, it might easily
record the foundation. The Zilán date reads **7 Muluc, 2 Kayab**,
denoting 891, as most probable.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[17:†](ybac13.htm#fr_12.md) Landa is in error here;
the proper spelling as given in the 1579 Relations, is **Tibolon**, 'at
the Nine,' as **Tiho**, the site of Merida, 'At the Five.' Also **ti-bul
on** means only 'we rambled,' and not 'we were played with,' a
meaningless term here; also Maya place names are simple or compound
nouns, not verbal phrases like this.
