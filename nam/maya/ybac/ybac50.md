### SEC. XLVI. HOW THERE ARE SERPENTS AND OTHER POISONOUS ANIMALS.

The diversity of snakes or serpents is great, of many colors and not
harmful, except for two kinds of very poisonous ones, much larger than
those we have here in Spain; one of which they call **taxinchan**. There
are also others very large and very poisonous, with rattles in their
tails. Others there are so large that they will swallow a hare, or two,
but are not harmful; it is to be related that some of the Indians take
hold of both kinds, without being harmed.

There is a kind of lizard, larger than ours here, of which it is
surprising the great fear the Indians have of them, for they say that
for them merely to touch a person causes a sweat that is a deadly
poison. There are many scorpions among the rocks, but they are not as
poisonous as those here in Spain.

There is a kind of large ants whose bite is very bad, and which pains
and suppurates more than that of the scorpions, and lasts twice as long,
as I know by experience. There are two kinds of spiders, one small and
very pestiferous, and the other very large and ail covered with very
fine black spines that look like down, and which hold the poison; thus
the Indians are most careful not to touch them. There are many other
reptiles that are not poisonous. There is a small red worm of which they
make a yellow ointment that is excellent for swellings and sores, and
needing no more than to crush and apply them; it also serves as oil for
painting vases and strengthening the paint.
