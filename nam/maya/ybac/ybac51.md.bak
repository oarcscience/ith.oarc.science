### SEC. XLVII. OF THE BEES AND THEIR HONEY AND WAX.

There are two kinds of bees, both being much smaller than ours; the
larger of these are raised in very small hives, and do not form a comb
as do ours, but instead certain small sacs like wax-nuts, all close
together and full of honey. To get this it is only necessary to open the
hive and break the sacs for the honey to run out, and then remove the
wax as convenient.

The others live in the woods, in the hollows of trees and rocks, where
one must hunt the wax. With this and the honey the country abounds, the
hones being most excellent save for the fact that it is somewhat watery
on account of the fertility of the food of the bees; it is therefore
necessary to heat it at the fire, which makes it very good and very
hard. The wax is fine, except for being smoky, the reason for which I
have not been able to discover; in some provinces it is much yellower on
account of the flowers. These bees do not sting, even when the honey is
gathered.
