### SEC. IV. EXPEDITION OF CORTES TO COZUMEL. LETTER TO AGUILAR AND HIS FRIENDS.

Hernando Cortés sailed from Cuba with eleven ships, the largest being of
100 tons burden, placing in them eleven captains, and himself being one
of these. He took along 500 men, some horses, and goods for barter,
having Francisco de Montejo as a captain and Alaminos as chief pilot of
the armada. On the admiral's ship he set a banner of white and blue in
honor of Our Lady, whose image, together with the cross, he always
placed wherever he destroyed idols. On the banner was a red cross
surrounded by a legend reading: *Amici sequamur crucem, et si habuerimus
fidem, in hoc signo vincemus*.

With this fleet and no further equipment he set sail and arrived at
Cozumel with ten ships, one becoming separated in a storm; he however
recovered it later on the coast. They arrived at Cozumel on the north,
where they found fine buildings of stone for the idols, and a fine town;
but the inhabitant. seeing so great a fleet and the soldiers
disembarking, all fled to the woods.

On reaching the town the Spaniards sacked it and lodged themselves.
Seeking through the woods for the natives they came on the chief's wife
and children. Through an Indian interpreter named Melchior, who had been
with Francisco Hernández and Grijalva, they learned it was the chief's
wife, to whom and the children Cortés gave presents and caused them to
send for the chief. Him on his arrival he treated very well, gave him
some small gift; and returned to him his wife and children, with all the
things that had been taken in the town; and begged him to have the
Indians return to their houses, saying that when they came everything
that had been taken away from them would be restored. When they were
thus restored, he preached to them the vanity of idols, and persuaded
them to adore the cross; this he placed in their temples with an image
of Our Lady, and therewith public idolatry ceased.

Here Cortés learned that there were bearded men six days away, in the
power of a chief, and persuaded the Indians to send a messenger to
summon them. With difficulty he found one that would go, because of the
fear they had of the chief of the bearded men. He then wrote this
letter:

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

Noble sirs: I left Cuba with a fleet of eleven ships and 500 Spaniards,
and laid up at Cozumel, whence I write this letter. Those of the island
have assured me that there are in the country five or six men with
beards and resembling us in all things. They are unable to give or tell
me other indications, but from these I conjecture and hold certain that
you are Spaniards. I and these gentlemen who go with me to settle and
discover these lands urge that within six days from receiving this you
come to us, without making further delay or excuse. If you shall come we
will make due acknowledgment, and reward the good offices which this
armada shall receive from you. I send a brigantine that you may come in
it, and two boats for safety.

The Indians took this letter wrapped in their hair, and gave it to
Aguilar. But the Indians delaying beyond the time appointed, those on
the ships believed them killed, and returned to the port of Cozumel.
Cortés then seeing that neither the Indians nor the bearded men
returned, set sail the next day. On that day, however, a ship sprung a
leak and it was necessary to return to port. While the repairs were
being made Aguilar, having received the letter, crossed the channel
between Yucatan and Cozumel in a canoe; when those of the fleet seeing
him approach went to see who it was, Aguilar asked whether they were
Christians. When they answered Yes, and Spaniards, he wept for joy and
falling on his knees gave thanks to God. He then asked the Spaniards if
it was Wednesday.

The Spaniards took him all naked as he was to Cortés, who clothed him
and treated him with much affection; and Aguilar related there <span
id="fr_5"></span>[\*](#fn_5.md) his peril and labors, and the death of his
companions, and how it was impossible to send word to Guerrero in so
short a time, he being more than eighty leagues away.

Aguilar having told his story, and being an excellent interpreter,
Cortés renewed the preaching of the adoration of the cross, and put the
idols out of the temples; and they say that this preaching by Cortés
made such an impression on those of Cuzco <span
id="fr_6"></span>[†](#fn_6.md) that they came out to the shore saying to
the Spaniards who passed: "Maria, Maria, Cortés, Cortés."

Cortés departed thence, touched Campeche in passing, but did not make a
stop until he reached Tabasco. Here among other presents and Indian

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

women which those of Tabasco gave to him was one who was afterwards
called Marina. She was from Xalisco, a daughter of noble parents, stolen
when small and sold in Tabasco, and later sold in Xicalango and
Champotón, where she learned the language of Yucatan. By this she was
able to understand Aguilar, and thus God provided Cortés with good and
faithful interpreters, through whom he acquired knowledge and intimacy
with Mexican matters. With these Marina was well posted, having mingled
with Indian merchants and leading people, who spoke of them daily.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_5"></span>[7:\*](ybac08.htm#fr_5.md) The pleasant Sunday
supplement story of the beautiful maiden, and the temptation arranged
for Aguilar by the chief, which of course must have first been given
currency by Aguilar himself, as related by Cogolludo, has probably been
repeated by every succeeding chronicler. It is a bit hard to visualize,
even when buttressed by his reported words on meeting Cortés’ men,
asking the Spaniards if they were Christians, and then verifying his
devotion to his breviary by asking if it was Wednesday. But beside it
should be set off a curiously surviving manuscript, dated Mexico, 1554,
in support of a petition for payment for military services under Cortés,
by one Cristóbal Doria, of Oaxaca, the husband by a "legitimate church
marriage" with Luisa, the natural daughter of Gerónimo de Aguilar, had
by him, "an unmarried bachelor, and free," by an unnamed Tarascan woman.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[7:†](ybac08.htm#fr_6.md) So in the ms., but clearly
an error for Cuzamil.
