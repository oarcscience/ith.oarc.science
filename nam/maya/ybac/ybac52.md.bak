### SEC. XLVIII. OF THE PLANTS, FLOWERS AND TREES; OF THE FRUITS AND OTHER EDIBLES.

Great and notable is the diversity of plants and flowers that adorn
Yucatan in their seasons, as well among the trees as the plants, many of
them being marvelously fine and beautiful, of many colors, and odorous;
outside also of the beauty with which they dress the woods and fields,
these plants afford the greatest abundance of supply for the bees for
honey and wax. Among these I shall give here a number, both for their
exquisite smell and beauty, and for the benefits derived from them by
those who dwell in that land.

There are sages much fresher and more odorous than those here, and with
longer and slenderer leaves; these the Indians cultivate for their odor,
and for their pleasure. I have noted that they increase their beauty by
putting ashes around the base.

There is one plant with broad leaves and tall, thick branches, of a
singular freshness and fertility, growing as they do in profusion from
cuttings, the same as do osiers, although not like these in any way;
rubbing the leaf a little between the hands it has a real odor of
clover, although it loses this when dry; it is good for freshening the
temples at fiestas, and for this it is used.

There is also sweet basil found in the woods and fields, which in some
parts are full of it; growing in those rocks it is very fresh, beautiful
and odorous, though not comparable with what is grown in the gardens,
imported from here, and which grows and spreads in a notable fashion.

There is a flower they call **tixzula**, of the most delicate odor I
have ever known, much more so than the jessamine; it is white, or light
purplish in

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

some cases, and could be brought here to Spain, since it sprouts from a
thick bulb. These bulbs put forth tall, thick and very fresh spires that
last the year around, and once a year bear in the center a green stem as
broad as three fingers and as long as the spires; at the end of these
come the flowers in a bunch, each being some six inches long with its
stem; when open they have five long leaflets, open and connected at the
base by a delicate white membrane, with pellicles in the center, white
and yellow and wonderfully beautiful. When this stalk is cut and put in
a jar of water, it holds the soft odor for many days, the joined flowers
only opening a little at a time.

There are certain small lilies that are very white and odorous, which
last long in water and would be easy to bring here, since they also grow
from bulbs and are quite like our lilies, except that the odor is more
delicate and does not give headaches; also it lacks the yellow center of
our lilies.

There is a rose they call **ixlaul**, which they tell me is of much
beauty, and odorous.

There is also a kind of tree they call **nicte**, that bears many white
roses, and others half yellow, and yet others half purplish; these are
fresh and odorous, and of them they fashion handsome garlands, and
lectuaries when they so desire.

There is a flower they call **kom**, that is very odorous and gives a
burning heat when smelled; it could easily be brought here. Its leaves
are broad and wonderfully fresh.

Besides these flowers and odorous plants there are many others most
beneficial and medicinal, among them two varieties of the *yerbamora* or
night shade, fresh and very handsome. There is much *doradilla* or
ceterach, and also maiden's hair; also a plant whose leaves boiled are a
wonderful remedy' for swollen feet and legs.

There is another especially good for the cure of sores, which they cab
**yaxpahalché**. Another has the odor of fennel; this is both eaten raw
or boiled, and so applied for the cure of sores. At Bayhalar there is
also found *zarzaparilla*.

They have a certain plant that grows in the pools and other places,
three-cornered like the sedge, but much thicker, out of which they make
their baskets, staining them beautifully with colors.

Also they have a plant that grows both wild and cultivated near them
houses (this being the best), and which is a kind of hemp (*cáñamo*),
which they employ for an infinity of useful things.

Again on certain trees there grows without cultivation a plant that
bears fruit like small cucumbers, out of which they make glue for
sticking thing, together, when needed.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

The seeds they have for human sustenance are very good *maize*, of many
different kinds and colors; of this they gather much and keep in a
granary or silo for poor years. There are two kinds of small beans, one
black and the other of different colors; others small and white that
have been brought over from Spain.

Their peppers have many different pods; the seeds of some of these are
used for seasoning. Others are for eating baked or boiled, and still
others for cups for household use. They have fine melons, and also
Spanish calabashes. They have millet, which yields excellently and is
good food.

They have a yellow fruit that is fresh and tasteful; this they sow, and
the root, growing like the turnip, short, fat and round, is the fruit;
this they eat raw with salt.

There is another root that grows under the earth, being sown, and is
great as food; of this there are many kinds, purplish, yellow and white,
which they eat boiled or roasted; they are good eating, and taste
somewhat like chestnuts; they also serve roasted for a drink. \[? the
peanut\]

There are two other kinds of good roots they use as food; also others
that grow wild and have a salty flavor, of which I have before spoken
and which serve them in seasons of famine; otherwise they do not use
them.

They have a small tree with soft branches containing much sap, whose
leaves they eat as a salad, tasting like cabbage and good with plenty of
fat bacon. The Indians plant it wherever they make their homes, and then
have the leaves for gathering the whole year. There is much fresh
chicory grown in the gardens, but they do not eat it.

It is a matter for praise to be given to God, with the prophet who has
said "Admirable, O Lord, is thy name in all lands," because of the great
number of trees thy Majesty has created in this land, and all so unlike
ours, so unlike what I have seen elsewhere (I speak of Yucatan), and of
all both the Indians and the Spaniards have great use and benefit.

One there is with a fruit like round gourds, out of which the Indians
make their vessels (*jícaras*); they are very handsome, and they paint
them elaborately and beautifully.

There is also another of the same species, only smaller and very hard,
of which they make small cups for ointments and other purposes.

There is another kind that bears a fruit like filberts, of whose kernels
they make fine beads, and whose bark is used for washing clothes the
same as soap, making a fine lather.

They cut the incense tree a great deal, for the demons; this they
extract cutting the bark with a stone for the sap to run out. This tree
is fresh, tall, and with fine leafage and shade, but its flower turns
the wax black when it is present.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

There is a very handsome tree that grows by the wells, tall and with
fresh leaves; this spreads its branches in a marvelous manner, growing
in a very orderly fashion from the trunk, in threes or more, around the
tree, and continuing to extend and the shoots to grow.

There are also cedars, but not of the finer kind.

There is a sort of yellowish tree, veined like an oak, marvelously
strong and hard, and so stout that we have seen it used as doorposts in
the houses at Izamal, and supporting the entire weight above.

There is another of the hardest kind, of a tawny color, of which they
make bows and lances.

There is another of the color of an orange, of which they make staffs,
very strong. I think it is called *brazil*.

There are many trees which they say are good for the affliction of
pustules, which they call **zon**.

There is a tree whose sap causes sores when touched, and even its shade
is noxious, if one sleeps under it.

There is another with double thorns, long and very hard and thick, on
which the birds never rest; these thorns are all hollowed inside, and
always filled with ants.

There is another tree of great height and size, which bears a fruit like
carob beans, filled with certain black seed-nuts that they eat in time
of famine; from the roots of this tree they make buckets for drawing
water from the wells.

There are others from whose bark the Indians make small cups for taking
water; also others from which they make ropes; also yet others whose
crushed bark they use for polishing plastered walls and hardening them.

There are beautiful mulberry trees, of fine wood; also so many other
useful and beautiful trees as to astonish one.

In the woods and fields there are many kinds of long osiers or willows
(not the kind of which they make baskets), which they use for tying in
erecting their houses, or whatever else they have need for; the use they
make of these is very great indeed.

Another tree gives a sap that is fine to strengthen the gums.

Another bears a certain large fruit that is filled with a wool that for
pillows is superior to tow.

 

Fearing to offend the fruit or their trees, I have felt best to put them
to themselves; and I will speak first of the wine that the Indians
esteem so highly, and therefore plant them in all their enclosures or
around their houses. It is an ugly tree, producing nothing but its
roots, and its wine by using honey and water.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

In the country there are certain wild vines bearing edible grapes; we
find many of these on the Cupul coast. There are plums of many kinds,
some of them very tasteful and wholesome; they are very different from
ours, having but little meat and a large stone, contrary to what is
found with those we have here; this tree puts forth its fruit before the
leaves, and without flower.

There are many bananas, these having been brought by the Spaniards,
since previously they did not have them.

There is a very large tree that bears a large, longish fruit, and fat
with a red meat, very fine to eat; it does not produce a flower, but
only the fruit, at first very small and growing by degrees.

There is another very leafy and beautiful tree, whose leaves never fall;
this also bears no flowers, but a fruit much sweeter than the one above,
small, dainty, well tasting and very delicate; some of these are better
than others, and the best would be much in favor if they were brought
over here; they call them **ya** in their language.

Another fresh and beautiful tree also holds its leaves without their
falling, and bears a small fig they call **ox**.

Another, exceedingly beautiful and fresh, bears a fruit like large eggs;
the Indians gather it green and ripen it in the ashes; when ripe it
lasts well, is sweet and tastes like the yolk of an egg \[*papaya*\].

Another tree bears also a yellow fruit, not so large as the one above,
but softer and sweeter; this when eaten leaves a kernel like a soft
prickly body, curious to see.

Another fresh and beautiful tree bears a fruit like hazelnuts, with its
husk, inside are fruit like *guindas*, with a large kernel. The Indians
call these **vayam**, and the Spaniards *guayas*.

There is another good and wholesome fruit the Spaniards brought, which
they call *guayavas*.

In the sierras there are two kinds of trees, one bearing fruit as large
as a good pear, very green, with a thick skin; these they ripen by
beating them on a stone, whereupon they have a special flavor. The other
bears fruit like pineapples, good to eat, juicy and acid; this has many
small kernels, but these are not wholesome.

There is another tree that grows only in open places, alone and never
among other trees; its bark is good for tanning hides, serving like
sumac; it bears a small tasty yellow fruit, which is much eaten by the
women.

There is a very large and fresh tree that the Indians call **on**; it
bears a fruit like largish small calabashes, soft and tasting like
butter; it is fatty and of much substance and nourishment. It has a
large kernel, a thin skin, and is eaten cut in slices like a melon, and
with salt.

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

There are artichokes (*cardos*) that are very spiny and ugly, growing
always on stems attached to other trees and growing from them; the fruit
of these is red-skinned, shaped like an artichoke (*alcachofa*), soft to
open, and without spines. The flesh inside is white, with many small
black seeds; it is sweet, most delicious, watery and melting in the
mouth, being eaten like an orange in sections around, and with salt; the
Spaniards eat as many as the Indians bring in from the woods.

There is a spongy tree, ugly but large, that bears a sort of large fruit
full of very savory yellow meat, with pits like hemp seeds but larger;
these are good for the urine. They make an excellent conserve from this
fruit; the tree puts out its leaves after the fruit has gone.

There is a small, rather spiny tree bearing a fruit shaped like a
slender cucumber, somewhat long; it is like the artichoke (*cardo*) in
taste, and is eaten in the same fashion, with salt, and in slices; the
seeds are like those of the small cucumbers, many and tender. If by some
chance a hole is made in the fruit while still on the tree, a gum
collects in it smelling like fine civet. The fruit is also an excellent
remedy for women's periodic troubles.

There is another tree whose flower is full of a soft odor, and whose
fruit is like what we here in Spain call blanc mange; there are many
different sorts, with fruit of different quality.

There is a tree that the Indians raise near their houses, bearing spiny
pods like chestnuts, but not so large nor so rough; they open when ripe
and contain small seeds which both Spaniards and Indians use to color
their condiments, as one does with saffron; the color is marked, and
stains a great deal \[*achiote*\].

I am sure that there remain yet other fruits, but I shall however speak
of those of the palms, of which there are two kinds. One kind
\[*huano*\] serves for thatching the houses, and is very tall and
slender; these bear great bunches of a black fruit like pulse, of which
the Indians are very fond.

The other kind is a low, very spiny palm whose leaves are very short and
thin, and serve no purpose; these bear great bunches of a round green
fruit, of the size of pigeons’ eggs. When the husk is removed there
remains a very hard kernel, inside of which is a pit the size of a
hazelnut, of good taste and useful in times of poor harvests; they make
of it a hot food which they take in the mornings, and on occasions use
the milk for flavoring as one does almonds.

They gather a very great amount of cotton, which grows in all parts of
the country, there being two sorts. One is sown each year and does not
last over, and the tree of this is small; the tree of the other kind
lasts five or six years. The fruit of both is in the forms of pods like
nuts, with a green husk that opens when ripe, showing the cotton within.

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

They are accustomed to gather the cochineal, which is said to be the
finest in the Indies, as growing on dry soil; the Indians gather some
little here and there.

There are colors of many kinds made from the juices of certain trees and
of flowers, but because the Indians have not known how to perfect them
by gums to temper them in prevention, they fade. But those who gather
the silk have already discovered the remedies, and say that they give as
perfect results as anywhere found.
