### SEC. XIV. STATE OF YUCATAN AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE SPANIARDS. DON FRANCISCO, SON OF THE ADMIRAL MONTEJO, RE-ESTABLISHES THE SPANISH RULE IN YUCATAN.

After the departure of the Spaniards from Yucatan, a drought followed in
the land, and the corn having been consumed during the wars with the
Spaniards they suffered much from famine and were reduced to eating the
bark of trees, especially of a certain kind called **cumché**
(**kunché**), the inside of which is soft and mellow. On account of This
famine the Xius of Maní undertook to snake a solemn sacrifice to the
idols, taking certain male and female slaves to cast into the pool at
Chichén Itzá. To do this they had to pass by the town of the Cocom
chiefs, their mortal enemies, hut thinking that ancient quarrels would
be forgotten in such times they sent to ask permission to pass through
the country. The Cocoms deceived them with a favorable answer, but
having lodged them all together in one great building they set fire to
it, and slew those who escaped. From this great wars

followed. <span id="fr_15"></span>[\*](#fn_15.md) There was also a plague
of locusts for five years, so great that no green thing was left and
such a famine ensued that they fell dead on the roads, and when the
Spaniards returned they did not recognize the country. However, four
good years followed and bettered the situation somewhat.

This Don Francisco set out for Yucatan along the rivers of Tabasco, and
entered by the lagoons of Dos Bocas. The first place he touched was
Champotón, whose chief Moch-Covoh had received Francisco Hernández and
Grijalva so ill. The chief however having died, Don Francisco met no
opposition, but was on the contrary supported with his company for two
years by the people of the place; during this time he could not advance
because of the resistance he encountered. Later he went to Campeche,
where he found the inhabitants very friendly, so that with their help
and that of the people of Champotón he accomplished the conquest. For
their fidelity he promised that the King would reward them, a promise
which up to the present time the King has not fulfilled.

Such resistance as he met was not strong enough to prevent Don Francisco
from reaching Tiho with his army; here he founded the city of Mérida,
and leaving the baggage there he set out to continue the conquest,
sending captains in different directions. Don Francisco sent his cousin
Francisco de Montejo to Valladolid to pacify the natives, who had
rebelled somewhat, and to settle the city as it now is. In Chectemal
\[Chetumal\] he founded the city of Salamanca \[de Bacalar\]; Campeche
he already had occupied. He established in orderly manner the services
of the Indians and the rule of the Spaniards, before the coming of his
father the admiral to assume control. The latter on arriving from
Chiapas with his wife and household was well received at Campeche, and
gave his own name to the city, as San Francisco; and then went on to the
city of Mérida.
