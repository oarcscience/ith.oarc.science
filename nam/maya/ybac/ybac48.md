*Yucatan Before and After the Conquest*, by Diego de Landa, tr. William
Gates, \[1937\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

### SEC. XLIV. THE SOIL AND ITS PRODUCTS.

Yucatan is a land of less soil than any I know, being all live flat
stones with very little earth, so that there are few places where one
can dig down a fathom without meeting great banks of large rocks. The
stone is not very good for fine carving, is hard and coarse; but such as
it is it has served to produce the great number of buildings in the
country. The country is excellent for lime, of which there is much; it
is a marvel how much fertility exists in the soil on or between the
stones, where is to be found all there is, more among the stones than
there is elsewhere; since on the earthy ground where it is to be found;
no trees grow, but only grass. But where they sow over the stony parts
they secure crops, and all the trees grow, some of them marvelously
large and beautiful. The cause I think is that more moisture is
preserved among the stones than in the earth.

In this country there has so far been found no kind of local metal; it
is astonishing that without it they have erected so many buildings,
since the Indians can tell nothing as to what tools were used. But since
they lack metals, God gave them a flint ridge near<span

where the sierra we first spoke of crosses the country; of this they
made points for the war spears, and also the knives used in sacrifice
(of which the priests have a great store); they also served and still do
as arrow tips, thus taking the place of metal. They had a certain soft
brass which, when founded with<span id="img_09401"></span>

a light mixture of gold yielded them hatchets and the little rattles
they used in their dances, as well as a certain sort of chisels which
they used in making the idols and boring out the blowpipes, as in this
figure in the margin; they use the blowpipe a great deal, and shoot well
with it. This brass and other placques or sheets, of greater hardness,
is part of their traffic in Tabasco for their idols. They had among them
no other kind of metal. <span id="fr_46"></span>[\*](#fn_46)

 

According to the wise, one of the things most needed by man is water,
without which the earth cannot produce its fruits or man live. Yucatan
lacks the abundance of rivers to be found in the neighboring countries,
having only two; one of these is<span id="img_09402"></span>

the Rio de Lagartos, which enters the sea next to a headland, and the
other is that of Champotón; both being salty and of bad water, God
provided many choice water sources, some natural and others brought out
by industry. In this respect nature has acted differently in this
country from the rest of the world, where the rivers and springs flow
above the ground,

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

whereas here all run in secret channels underground. As we have been
told, the entire coast is full of springs of sweet water, rising in the
sea, and from many of which one can get water, as I myself have done,
when the ebb tide has left the shore dry.

Inland God has provided various breaks in the<span

natural rock, which the Indians call cenotes, cut and reaching down to
the water; at times there are below furious currents so as to carry off
cattle that fall into them; all these go out into the sea, and from them
the above springs come. These cenotes contain fine water and are a great
sight, for some of them are of cut natural rock clear down to the water;
others have mouths that God created, or were caused by the accidents of
thunderbolts (such as often fall), or in other ways. Inside we, find
handsome arches of the living rock, while on the top are trees, so that
above is forest and underneath the cenotes; in some a boat may be taken
and used; with others larger or smaller. The people who got to these
cenotes drank of them, having no wells, or very poor ones due to their
lack of tools. Now however we have given them work at making good wells,
as very excellent pumping wells whence the water can be taken as from a
spring. There are also found lagoons, but all of these are of brackish
water, bad to drink, and without the currents found in the cenotes.

THE UNDERGROUND CAVE OF LOLTUN  

There is one thing in this country, in all this marvellous matter of the
wells, which is that wherever we find them there comes out fine spring
water, and some so beautiful that a lance goes down into them; and also
that in all places where they have dug there has been found at half a
man's height above the water a bench of seashells and caracols of many
different kinds and colors, large and small, like those found on the
seashore, with the sand already converted into hard white rock. At Maní,
the royal town, we dug a great pumping well for the use of the Indians,
and after having dug seven to eight fathoms in the living rock we found
a grave a good seven feet long, filled with very fresh red earth and
with human bones, which when removed were

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

found to be almost converted into stone. This was still two to three
fathoms from the water, before reaching which we came to a hollow arch,
made by God, in such fashion as that the grave was set within the rock,
and one could walk underneath to where it was. We could not understand
how this could have been, unless we might say that the grave was opened
there on the inside, and afterwards by the moisture of the cave, and the
lapse of time, the rock hardened and grew to close it up.

Besides the two rivers which we have said are in the country, there is a
spring three leagues from the sea near Campeche that is brackish; and in
the whole land there is no other, nor other waters. The Indians living
toward the sierra, needing to have their wells very deep, are accustomed
to gather the rain water for their homes in that season, in great
cavities in the rocks; because very heavy rains come then, with much
thunder and lightning at times. All the wells, especially those near the
sea, rise and fall every day at the hours of high and low tides, showing
clearly that the underground rivers run into the sea.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_46"></span>[94:\*](ybac48.htm#fr_46) <span id="page_93">p.
93</span> In seeking to illustrate the objects of use referred to by
Landa we are helped by the known extent of their trading relations, from
Honduras as far as the Mizteca region. Cortés needing to cast brass
cannon sought and found the needed source of tin, and that this hardened
copper was a part of the Tabasco trade we know. Landa also speaks in his
last chapter of fire-hardened spears, a weapon hard to find still
surviving as a specimen. The same with their ancient bows and arrows.
Even the marginal figure here referred to in the text has been left out
in the transcribed copy of Landa's manuscript; all however without
leaving us wholly without pictured reproductions. Of the illustrations
on these pages the collection of implements is taken from the manuscript
of Fuentes y Guzmin's history of Guatemala, as also are the interesting
human figures representing native bowmen, and also an "Indio noble"
holding what is clearly a spear of hardened wood. Of the three small
figures in the margin above we have a copper axe from an original
Mexican codex, a copper bell from the <span id="page_94">p.
94</span>cenote at Chichén Itzá, and an illustration of the use of one
of the very copper chisels to carve the 'idols,' from the Madrid codex.
A chipped flint sacrificial knife, also from the cenote, has been shown
previously.
