### SEC. XXXVIII. SACRIFICES OF THE NEW YEAR OF THE LETTER CAUAC. THE EVILS PROPHESIED AND THEIR REMEDY IN THE DANCE OF THE FIRE.

In the year whose dominical was **Cauac** and the augury **Hosan-ek**,
after the election of the one to serve as president had been made, they
made an image of the demon named **Ek-uvayeyab**, and carried this to
the piles of stone on the West, where they had left the other the year
before. They also made a statue of a demon called **Vacmitun-ahau**,
which they put in the president's house in a convenient place, and from
there went all together to where the image of **Vacmitun-ahau** stood,
having the road thither all properly prepared. On arriving the priest
and the chiefs offered incense, as they were accustomed, and cut off the
head of a fowl. After this they took the image on a standard called
**yax-ek**, placing on the back of the image a skull

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

and a corpse, and on top a carnivorous bird called **kuch**
\['vulture'\], as a sign of great mortality, since they regarded this as
a very evil year.

They then carried it thus with their sentiment and devotion, dancing
various dances, among which was one like the *cazcarientas*, which they
thus called the **xibalba-okot**, meaning the dance of the devil. The
cup-bearers brought to the road the drink of the chiefs, which they
drank and came to the place of the statue **Vacmitun-ahau**, and then
they placed before it the image they brought. Thereupon commenced the
offerings, the incense, and the prayers, while many drew blood from many
parts of the body, to anoint the stone of the demon called
**Ekel-acantun**; thus the fatal days passed, after which they carried
**Vacmitun-ahau** to the temple, and **Ek-uvayeyab** to the place of the
South, to receive it the next year.

This year whose sign is **Cauac** and which was ruled by the bacab
**Hosan-ek**, they held as one of mortality and very bad, according to
the omens; for they said that many hot spells would kill the maize
fields, while the multitudes of the ants and the birds would eat up the
seeds that had been sown; but since this would not happen in all parts,
in some places they would lack food, and in others have it, though with
heavy labor. To avoid this the evil one caused them to make four demons
called **Chichac-chob**, **Ekbalam-chac**, **Ahcanuol-cab**,
**Ahbuluc-balam**, and set them in the temple where they should offer
incense, and burn two balls of the milk or resin called **kik**,
together with some iguanas, and bread, a miter, a bunch of flowers, and
one of their precious stones. After this, to celebrate the festival,
they made a great vault of wood, filling it aloft and on the sides with
firewood, leaving doors to enter and go out. Then the most of the men
took each two bundles of rods, very dry and long, tied together, and a
singer standing on top of the firewood sang and made sound with one of
their drums, while those below danced in complete unison and devotion,
entering and leaving the doors of that wooden vault; dancing thus until
the evening, each left there his bundle, and they then went home to rest
and eat.

When the night came on they returned, and with them came a great crowd,
because this ceremony was held in great regard. Each then took his
bundle of rods, lit it, and each for himself put fire to the firewood,
which burned high and quickly. When only the coals were left, they
smoothed and spread them out; then those who had danced having come
together, some of them began to walk unshod and naked from one side to
the other across the hot coals; some of these came off with no lesions
whatever, some came burned or half burned. In this way they believed to
lie the remedy against the ills and bad auguries, and that this was the
service most acceptable to their gods. After this they went off to drink
and get intoxicated, for this was called for by the customs of the
festival, and by the heat of the fire.
