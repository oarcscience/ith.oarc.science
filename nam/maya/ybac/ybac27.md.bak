### SEC. XXIII. INDUSTRY, COMMERCE AND MONEY. AGRICULTURE AND, SEEDS. JUSTICE AND HOSPITALITY.

Among the occupations of the Indians were pottery and wood-working; they
made much profit from forming idols of clay and wood, in doing which
they fasted much and followed many rites. There were also physicians, or
better named, sorcerers, who healed by use <span id="img_03701"></span>

of herbs and their superstitious practices. It was so also with all
their other occupations.

Their favorite occupation was trading, whereby they brought in salt;
also cloths<span id="img_03702"></span>

and slaves from Tabasco and Ulúa. In their bartering they used cacao and
stone counters which they had for money, and with which they bought
slaves and other fine and beautiful stones, such as the chiefs wore as
jewels on festal occasions. They had also certain red shells for use as
money and jewels for wearing; these they carried in network

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

purses. In their markets they dealt in all the products of the country;
they gave credit, borrowed and paid promptly and without usury.

The commonest occupation was agriculture, the raising of maize and the
other seeds; these they kept in well-constructed places<span

and in granaries for sale in due time. Their mules and oxen were the
people themselves. For each married man and his wife it was their custom
to plant a space of 400 feet, which was called **hun** **vinic** \[one
man\], a plot measured with a 20-foot rod, 20 in breadth and 20, in
length.

The Indians have the excellent custom of helping each other in all their
work. At the time of planting, those who have no people of their own to
do it join together in bands of twenty, or more or less, and all labor
together to complete the labor of each, all duly measured, and do not
stop until all is finished. The lands today are in common, and whoever
occupies a place first, holds it; they sow in different places, so that
if the crop is short in one, another will make it up. When they work the
land they do no more than gather the brush and burn it before sowing.
From the middle of January to April they care for the land and then
plant when the rains come. Then carrying a small sack on the shoulders
they make a hole in the ground

The growing plant springs from the head of the god Itzamna. The plant,
springing from the earth, withers and is revived. The Corn deity holds
forth the growing plant, springing from the sign **ik**, or Breath,
Life. (All the figures shown on this page are from the Madrid Codex,
which has chiefly to do with farm ceremonies.)

Itzamná plants the tree in the earth. Itzamná drops the seed in the
earth and animals attack it. Worms attack the Corn-god, seated on the
earth. Birds of prey feed on the dying Corn-god (note the closed eye).

with a stick, dropping in five or six grains, and covering them with the
same stick. When it. rains, it is marvelous how they grow. In hunting
also, they unite in bands of fifties, or more or less; the flesh of the
deer they grill over rods to keep it from spoiling; then when they come
back to the town they first make their presents to the chief and then
distribute all as between friends. In fishing they do the same.

The Fire-dog, or heat rays from the sun, burns the growth, while the
Corn-god, with arms bound, is dying. Next, Itzamná waters the growing
maize, denoted by the kan-sign. The hunter ties up the deer.

In making visits the Indians always carry a gift, according to their
quality, and the one visited returns the gifts with another. During
these visits third persons present speak and listen attentively to those
talking, having due regard for their rank; notwithstanding which all use
the 'thou.' Those of less position must, however, in the course of
the<span id="img_03901"></span>

conversation, repeat the title or dignity of the one higher in rank.
They have the custom of assisting one who delivers a message by
responding with a cadence of the voice, a sort of aspirate in the
throat, as if to say 'it is well,' or 'be it so.' The women are brief in
what they say, nor do they have the habit of negotiating on their own
account, especially if poor; for this the chiefs scoffed at the friars
for giving ear to poor and rich without distinction.

For offenses committed by one against another the chief of the town
required satisfaction to be made by the town of the aggressor; if this
was refused it became the occasion of more trouble. If they were of the
same town they laid it before the judge as arbitrator, and he ordered
satisfaction given; if the offender lacked the means for this, his
parents or friends helped him out. The cases in which they were
accustomed to require such amends were in instances of involuntary
homicide, the suicide of either husband or wife on the other's account,
the accidental burning of houses, lands of inheritance, hives or
granaries. Other offenses committed with malice called for reparation
through blood or blows.

are very generous and hospitable; no one enters their houses without
being offered food and drink, what drink they may have during the day,
or food in the evening. If they have none, they seek it from a neighbor;
if they unite together on the roads, all join in sharing even if they
have little for their own need.
