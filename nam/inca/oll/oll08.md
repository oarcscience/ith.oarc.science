*Apu Ollantay*, by Clements Markham, \[1910\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SCENE 5

The great hall of the palace of Pachacuti. *The* INCA, *as before,
seated on the* tiana. *Enter to him* RUMI-ÑAUI.

  *Pachacuti*. I ordered a search to be made,  
But Ollantay was not to be found.  
My rage I can scarcely control--  
Hast thou found this infamous wretch?

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

  *Rumi-ñaui*. His fear makes him hide from thy wrath.  
  *Pachacuti*. Take a thousand men fully armed,  
And at once commence the pursuit.  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. Who can tell what direction to take?  
Three days have gone by since his flight,  
Perchance he 's concealed in some house,  
And till now he is there, safely hid.

(*Enter a* chasqui *or messenger with* quipus.)

Behold, O King, a messenger  
From Urubamba he has come.  
  *Chasqui*. I was ordered to come to my King,  
Swift as the wind, and behold me.  
  *Pachacuti*. What news bringest thou?  
  *Chasqui*. This *quipu* will tell thee, O King.  
  *Pachacuti*. Examine it, O Rumi-ñaui.  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. Behold the *llanta*, and the knots <span
id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md)  
Announce the number of his men.  
  *Pachacuti* (*to* Chasqui). And thou, what hast thou seen?  
  *Chasqui*. 'Tis said that all the Anti host  
Received Ollantay with acclaim;  
Many have seen, and they recount,  
Ollantay wears the royal fringe.  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. The *quipu* record says the same.  
  *Pachacuti*. Scarcely can I restrain my rage!  
Brave chief, commence thy march at once,  
Before the traitor gathers strength.  
If thy force is not enough,  
Add fifty thousand men of mine.  
Advance at once with lightning speed,  
And halt not till the foe is reached.  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. To-morrow sees me on the route,

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

I go to call the troops at once  
The rebels on the Colla road,  
I drive them flying down the rocks.  
Thine enemy I bring to thee,  
Dead or alive, Ollantay falls.  
Meanwhile, O Inca, mighty Lord,  
Rest and rely upon thy thrall.

\[*Exeunt*.

END OF ACT I.
