# ACT II

### SCENE 1

Ollantay-tampu. Hall of the fortress-palace. Back scene seven immense
stone, slabs, resting on them a monolith right across. Above masonry. At
sides masonry with recesses; in the R*. centre a great doorway. A
golden* tiana *against the central slab*.

(*Enter* OLLANTAY *and* URCO HUARANCA, *both fully armed*.)

  *Urco Huaranca*. Ollantay, thou hast been proclaimed  
By all the Antis as their Lord.  
The women weep, as you will see--  
They lose their husbands and their sons,  
Ordered to the Chayanta war.  
When will there be a final stop  
To distant wars? Year after year  
They send us all to far-off lands,  
Where blood is made to flow like rain.  
The King himself is well supplied  
With coca and all kinds of food.  
What cares he that his people starve?  
Crossing the wilds our llamas die,  
Our feet are wounded by the thorns,  
And if we would not die of thirst  
We carry water on our backs.  
  *Ollantay*. Gallant friends! Ye hear those words,  
Ye listen to the mountain chief.

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

Filled with compassion for my men,  
I thus, with sore and heavy heart,  
Have spoken to the cruel king:  
'The Anti-suyu must have rest;  
All her best men shan't die for thee,  
By battle, fire, and disease--  
They die in numbers terrible.  
How many men have ne'er returned,  
How many chiefs have met their death  
For enterprises far away?'  
For this I left the Inca's court, <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36)  
Saying that we must rest in peace;  
Lot none of us forsake our hearths,  
And if the Inca still persists,  
Proclaim with him a mortal feud.

(*Enter* HANCO HUAYLLU, *several chiefs, and a great crowd of soldiers
and people*.)

  *People*. Long Eve our king, Ollantay  
Bring forth the standard and the fringe,  
Invest him with the crimson fringe  
In Tampu now the Inca reigns,  
He rises like the star of day.

(*The chiefs, soldiers, and people range them selves round.* Ollantay
*is seated on the tiana by* Hanco Huayllu*, an aged* Auqui *or Prince*.)

  *Hanco Huayllu*. Receive from me the royal fringe,  
'Tis given by the people's will.

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

Uilcañota <span id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37) is a distant land,  
Yet, even now, her people come  
To range themselves beneath thy law.

(Ollantay *is invested with the fringe. He rises*.)

  *Ollantay*. Urco Huaranca, thee I name  
Of Anti-suyu Chief and Lord;  
Receive the arrows and the plume,

(Gives them.)

Henceforth thou art our general.  
  *People*. Long life to the Mountain Chief.  
  *Ollantay*. Hanco Huayllu, <span id="fr_38"></span>[2](#fn_38) of all
my lords  
Thou art most venerable and wise,  
Being kin to the august High Priest,  
It is my wish that thou shouldst give  
The ring unto the Mountain Chief.

(Urco Huaranca *kneels, and* Hanco Huayllu *addresses him*.)

  *Hanco Huayllu*. This ring around thy finger's placed  
That thou mayst feel, and ne'er forget,  
That when in fight thou art engaged,  
Clemency becomes a hero chief.  
  *Urco Huaranca*. A thousand times, illustrious king,  
I bless thee for thy trust in me.  
  *Hanco Huayllu*. Behold the valiant Mountain Chief,  
Now fully armed from head to foot,  
And bristling like the *quiscahuan*, <span
id="fr_39"></span>[3](#fn_39)  
Accoutred as becomes a knight.

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

(*Turning to* Urco Huaranca.)

Ne'er let thine enemies take thee in rear  
Man of the Puna, <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40) it ne'er can be
said  
You fled or trembled as a reed.  
  *Urco Huaranca*. Hear me, warriors of the Andes!  
Already we have a valiant king,  
It might be he will be attacked;  
'Tis said th' old Inca sends a force,  
The men of Cuzco now advance.  
We have not a single day to lose;  
Call from the heights our Puna men,  
Prepare their arms without delay,  
Make Tampu strong with rampart walls,  
No outlet leave without a guard;  
On hill slopes gather pois'nous herbs  
To shoot our arrows, carrying death.  
  *Ollantay* (*to* Urco Huaranca). Select the chiefs!  
Fix all the posts for different tribes;  
Our foes keep marching without sleep--  
Contrive to check them by surprise.  
The *compi* <span id="fr_41"></span>[2](#fn_41) ruse may cause their
flight.  
  *Urco Huaranca*. Thirty thousand brave Antis are here,  
Amongst them no weakling is found;  
Apu Maruti, <span id="fr_42"></span>[3](#fn_42) the mighty in war,  
From high Uilcapampa <span id="fr_43"></span>[4](#fn_43) will come,  
On steep Tinquiqueru <span id="fr_44"></span>[5](#fn_44) he'll stand

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

To march when the signal appears;  
On the opposite side of the stream  
Prince Chara <span id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45) has mustered his
force;  
In the gorge Charamuni <span id="fr_46"></span>[2](#fn_46) I post  
Ten thousand armed Antis on watch;  
Another such force is in wait  
On the left, in the vale of Pachar. <span
id="fr_47"></span>[3](#fn_47)  
We are ready to meet our foes,  
We await them with resolute calm;  
They will march in their confident pride  
Until their retreat is out off,  
Then the trumpet of war shall resound,  
From the mountains the stones shall pour down,  
Great blocks will be hurled from above.  
The Huancas <span id="fr_48"></span>[4](#fn_48) are crushed or
dispersed,  
Then the knife shall do its fell work,  
All will perish by blows from our hands,  
Our arrows will follow their flight.  
  *People and soldiers*. It is well! It is very well!

(*Cheers and martial music*.)

\[*Exeunt*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_36"></span>[369:1](oll09.htm#fr_36) This, as we have seen,
was not the reason why Ollantay fled from Cuzco; but, from a leader's
point of view, it was an excellent reason to give to the people of
Anti-suyu. The great wars of the Incas were, to some extent, a heavy
drain upon the people, but the recruiting was managed with such skill,
and was so equally divided among a number of provinces, that it was not
much felt.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[370:1](oll09.htm#fr_37) The snowy mountain far
to the south, in sight from Cuzco. *Uilca*, sacred; *unuta*, water. Here
is the source of the river *Uilcamayu*, which flows by Ollantay-tampu.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[370:2](oll09.htm#fr_38) The aged *Hanco
Huayllu* as *Auqui*, or Prince of the Blood, and relation of the High
Priest, gave éclat to these ceremonies.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[370:3](oll09.htm#fr_39) *Quiscahuan*. anything
full of thorns.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[371:1](oll09.htm#fr_40) *Puna*, the loftier
parts of the Andes.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[371:2](oll09.htm#fr_41) *Compi*, cloth or a
cloak. This was an expression of the ancient Peruvians, perhaps
equivalent to our 'hoodwinking.'

<span id="fn_42"></span>[371:3](oll09.htm#fr_42) Apu Maruti was the head
of the *ayllu* of the Inca Yahuar Huaccac, grandfather of Pachacuti. It
was called the *ayllu* Aucaylli Panaca.--Mesa, *Anales del Cuzco*,
quoted by Zegarra.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[371:4](oll09.htm#fr_43) Uilcapampa, mass of
mountains between the Uilcamayu and Apurimac.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[371:5](oll09.htm#fr_44) Tinqui Queru, between
Urupampa and Tampu. The word means 'two vases coupled.' Here are two
rounded hills connected by a saddle, three and a half miles from Tampu.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[372:1](oll09.htm#fr_45) Chara, was another
descendant of Yahuar Huaccac.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[372:2](oll09.htm#fr_46) A ravine on the right
bank of the Vilcamayu.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[372:3](oll09.htm#fr_47) Pachar is on the left
bank of the Vilcamayu opposite Ollantay-tampu, with which it is
connected by a rope bridge.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[372:4](oll09.htm#fr_48) Huancas, natives of the
valley of Jauja--Inca recruits.
