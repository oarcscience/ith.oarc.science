<p>A garden in the house of the Virgins of the Sun</i>. Chilca <i>shrubs and</i> mulli <i>trees</i> (Schinus Molle) <i>with panicles of red berries. The walls of the house at the back, with a door. A gate</i> (L.) <i>opening on the street</i>.</p><dir> <dir>  
<p>(YMA SUMAC <i>discovered at the gate looking out. To her enters</i> (R.) PITU SALLA. <i>Both dressed in white with golden belts</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Pitu Salla</i>. Yma Sumac, do not approach<br> So near that gate, and so often;<br> It might arouse the Mother's wrath.<br> Thy name, which is so dear to me,<br> Will surely pass from mouth to mouth.<br> Honour shall be shown to chosen ones,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> Who wish to close the outer gate.<br> Amuse thyself within the walls,<br> And no one then can say a word.<br> Think well what you can find within--<br> It gives you all you can desire,<br> Of dresses, gold, and dainty food.<br> Thou art beloved by every one,<br> E'en Virgins of the royal blood.<br> The Mothers love to carry thee,<br> They give thee kisses and caress--<br> You they prefer to all the rest.<br> What more could any one desire,<br> Than always to remain with them,</p>

<p>Destined to be servant of the Sun?<br> In contemplating Him there's peace.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Yma Sumac</i>. Pitu Salla, ever you repeat<br> The same thing and the same advice;<br> I will open to thee my whole heart,<br> And say exactly what I think.<br> Know that to me this court and house<br> Are insupportable--no less;<br> The place oppresses--frightens me--<br> Each day I curse my destiny.<br> The faces of all the <i>Mama Cuna</i><br> Fill me with hatred and disgust,<br> And from the place they make me sit,<br> Nothing else is visible.<br> Around me there is nothing bright,<br> All are weeping and ne'er cease<br> If I could ever have my way,<br> No person should remain within.<br> I see the people pass outside,<br> Laughing as they walk along.<br> The reason it is plain to see--<br> They are not mewed and cloistered here.<br> Is it because I have no mother,<br> That I am kept a prisoner?<br> Or is it I 'm a rich novice?<br> Then from to-day I would be poor.<br> Last night I could not get to sleep,<br> I wandered down a, garden walk;<br> In the dead silence of the night,<br> 1 heard one mourn. A bitter cry,<br> As one who sought and prayed for death.<br> On every side I looked about,<br> My hair almost on end with fright,<br> Trembling, I cried, 'Who canst thou be?'<br> Then the voice murmured these sad words:</p> 
<p><a name="page_377"><font size="1" color="green">p. 377</font></A></p> 
<p>'O Sun, release me from this place!'<br> And this. amidst such sighs and groans!<br> I searched about, but nothing found--<br> The grass was rustling in the wind.<br> I joined my tears to that sad sound,<br> My heart was torn with trembling fear.<br> When now the recollection comes,<br> I'm filled with sorrow and with dread.<br> You know now why I hate this place.<br> Speak no more, my dearest friend,<br> Of reasons for remaining here.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Pitu Salla</i>. At least go in. The Mother may appear.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Yma Sumac</i>. But pleasant is the light of day.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> MAMA CCACCA, L., <i>in grey with black edges and belt</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mama Ccacca</i>. Pitu Salla, hast thou spoken<br> All I told thee to that child?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Pitu Salla</i>. I have said all to her.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mama Ccacca</i>. And she, does she answer freely?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Pitu Salla</i>. She has wept and asked for pity,<br> Refusing to comply at all.<br> She will not take the virgin's oath.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mama Ccacca</i>. And this in spite of thy advice?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Pitu Salla</i>. I showed her the dress she will wear,<br> Telling her misfortune would befall<br> If she refused to be a chosen one--<br> That she would ever be an outcast,<br> And for us a child accursed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mama Ccacca</i>. What can she imagine,<br> Wretched child of an unknown father,<br> A maid without a mother,<br> Just a fluttering butterfly?<br> Tell her plainly, very plainly,</p> 
<p><a name="page_378"><font size="1" color="green">p. 378</font></A></p> 
<p>That these walls offer her a home,<br> Suited for outcasts such as she,<br> And here no light is seen.</p>
