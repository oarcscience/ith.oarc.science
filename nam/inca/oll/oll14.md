*Apu Ollantay*, by Clements Markham, \[1910\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SCENE 3

The great terrace entrance to Ollantay-tampu. On R. *a long masonry wall
with recesses at intervals. At back a great entrance doorway. On* L.
t*erraces descend, with view of valley and mountains*.

(*Guards discovered at entrance doorway. To them enter* RUMI-ÑAUI *in
rags, his face cut and slashed with wounds, and covered with blood*.)

  *Rumi-ñaui*. Will no one here have pity on me?  
  *One of the Guards*. Who art thou, man?  
Who has ill-treated thee?  
Thou comest in a frightful state,  
Covered with blood and gaping wounds.  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. Go quickly to thy king and say  
That one he loves has come to him.  
  *One of the Guards*. Thy name?  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. There is no need to give a name.  
  *One of the Guards*. Wait here.

\[*Exit one of the guards*.

(*Enter* OLLANTAY *with guards*, R. *front*.)

  *Rumi-ñaui*. A thousand times I thee salute,  
Ollantay, great and puissant king!  
Have pity on a fugitive  
Who seeks a refuge here with thee.  
  *Ollantay*. Who art thou, man? Approach nearer.  
Who has thus ill-treated thee?  
Were such deep and fearful wounds  
Caused by a fall, or what mishap?  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. Thou knowest me, O mighty chief.  
I am that stone that fell down once,  
But now I fall before thy feet;  
O Inca! mercy! Raise me up!

(*Kneels*.)

  *Ollantay*. Art thou the noble Rumi-ñaui,  
Great Chief and Lord of Hanan-suyu?  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. Yes, I was that well-known Chief--  
A bleeding fugitive to-day.  
  *Ollantay*. Rise, comrade mine. Let us embrace.

(*Rises*.)

Who has dared to treat thee thus,  
And who has brought thee here to me  
Within my fortress, on my hearth?

(*To attendants*.)

Bring new clothes for my oldest friend.

\[*Exit an attendant*.

How is it that thou art alone?  
Camest thou not fearing death?  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. A new king reigns in Cuzco now--  
Tupac Yupanqui is installed.  
Against the universal wish,  
He rose upon a wave of blood;  
Safety he sees in headless trunks,

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

The *sunchu* <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63) and the *nucchu* <span
id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_64) red  
Are sent to all he would destroy.  
Doubtless you have not forgot  
That I was Hanan-suyu's Chief.  
Yupanqui ordered me to come;  
Arrived, I came before the king,  
And as he has a cruel heart,  
He had me wounded as you see;  
And now thou knowest, king and friend,  
How this new Inca treated me.  
  *Ollantay*. Grieve not, old friend Rumi-ñaui,  
Thy wounds before all must be cured;  
I see in thee th' avenging knife,  
To use against the tyrant's heart.  
At Tampu now we celebrate  
The Sun's great Raymi festival;  
On that day all who love my name,  
Throughout my realms hold festival.  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. Those three days of festival  
To me will be a time of joy,  
Perhaps I may be healed by then,  
So that my heart may pleasure seek.  
  *Ollantay*. It will be so. For three whole nights  
We drink and feast, to praise the Sun,  
The better to cast all care aside  
We shall be shut in Tampu fort.  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. The youths, as is their wont, will find  
Their great delight in those three nights,  
Then will they rest from all their toils,  
And carry off the willing girls.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_63"></span>[386:1](oll14.htm#fr_63) *Sunchu*, a very large
*composita* with a yellow flower, growing round Cuzco. It was one of
those which were used on sacred festivals.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[386:2](oll14.htm#fr_64) *Nucchu* is a *salvia*,
also considered sacred. A red flower. Perhaps these flowers were sent as
a summons from the Inca, but I have not seen the custom mentioned
elsewhere.
