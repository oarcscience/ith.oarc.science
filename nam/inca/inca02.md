# DEATH OF PACHACUTI INCA YUPANQUI

#### from "History of the Incas" by Pedro Sarmiento De Gamboa, translated by Clements Markham, Cambridge: The Hakluyt Society 1907, pp. 138-139.

BEING IN THE HIGHEST PROSPERITY and sovereignty of his life, he fell ill
of a grave infirmity, and, feeling that he was at the point of death, he
sent for all his sons who were then in the city. In their presence he
first divided all his jewels and contents of his wardrobe. Next he made
them plough furrows in token that they were vassals of their brother,
and that they had to eat by the sweat of their hands. He also gave them
arms in token that they were to fight for their brother. He then
dismissed them.

He next sent for the Incas *orejones* of Cuzco, his relations, and for
Tupac Inca his son to whom he spoke, with a few words, in this manner:
"Son! you now see how many great nations I leave to you, and you know
what labour they have cost me. Mind that you are the man to keep and
augment them. No one must raise his two eyes against you and live, even
if he be your own brother. I leave you these our relations that they may
be your councillors. Care for them and they shall serve you. When I am
dead, take care of my body, and put it in my houses at Patallacta. Have
my golden image in the House of the Sun, and make my subjects, in all
the provinces, offer up solemn sacrifice, after which keep the feast of
*purucaya*, that I may go to rest with my father the Sun." Having
finished his speech they say that he began to sing in a low and sad
voice with words of his own language. They are as follows:

"I was born as a flower of the field,  
As a flower I was cherished in my youth,  
I came to my full age, I grew old,  
Now I am withered and die."

Having uttered these words, he laid his head upon a pillow and expired,
giving his soul to the devil, having lived a hundred and twenty-five
years. For he succeeded, or rather he took the Incaship into his hands
when he was twenty-two, and he was sovereign one hundred and three
years.
