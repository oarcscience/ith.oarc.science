This book is a compendium of translations of four rather disparate
documents relating to pre-conquest Peru. As with most early studies of
Spanish America, they range rather freely between religion, history, and
laws. The fourth in particular is exclusively concerned with laws, while
the third is mythological, and is also interesting because it deals with
an outlying province of the Inca empire. The printed book also contains
a fifty page index of subjects, places, names, and Quechua words which
is not reproduced here.
