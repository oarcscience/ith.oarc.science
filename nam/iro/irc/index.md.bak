# Iroquoian Cosmology

## By J. N. B. Hewitt

#### \[ARBAE 21:127-339\]

#### \[1903\]

This is a set of literal translations of three Iroquois creation myths,
from the Onondaga, Seneca and Mohawk tribes respectively. The
interlinear translations in the original have been omitted for technical
reasons. These myths are of great interest for several reasons. The
Iroquois Confederation was the dominant culture group in the
northeastern region at the time of European contact, and as such has
maintained its traditions in a fairly intact state. There are minor
infiltrations of Biblical elements in the narrative, which are, however,
easy to recognize.

The Iroquois had a matrilinear culture in which men and women shared
power, which is reflected in this myth by the strong participation of
female demi-gods in the creation. The translation is by an experienced
anthropologist writing for an academic audience and so it is almost
completely free of the sentimentality and prudishness that infected
other contemporary books about Native American mythology and folklore.
