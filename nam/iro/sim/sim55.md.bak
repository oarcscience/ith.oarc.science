IN Geneseo there was a young man, an orphan, who went around among the
people, staying wherever kindhearted persons would keep him, sleeping on
the ground by a brush fire, and eating whatever was given to him. When
he was twenty years old, he was as much of a boy as ever.

A chief, who was rich and proud, lived in Geneseo. He had a daughter and
two or three sons. One day the orphan stopped near the chief's house
where people were burning brush.

One of the chief's sons came out and said to him, "Don't you feel poor
and lonely sitting around so?"

"No," said the young man, "I feel as rich as you do."

"Don't you sometimes think you would like to have a wife?"

"Yes, I sometimes think I would like a wife if I could get one."

"What would you think of my sister for a wife? Many men have tried to
marry her, but she refuses everyone."

"Oh," said the orphan, looking up, "I would as soon have her as any
woman; she is handsome and rich."

"I will ask her to marry you," said the brother, thinking to have fun
with his sister.

He went to the house and said to her, "There is a young man out there by
the fire, who would like to marry you. Will you be his wife?"

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

"I will. I would rather marry him than anyone else."

"Shall I tell him so?"

"You may."

He told the young man, who said, "I shall be glad to have her for my
wife."

The brother, in fun, repeated this to his sister, who said, "I will go
and ask him myself."

She went to the orphan, and asked, "What did my brother say to you?"

He told her, and she said, "I will go with you. Come to-morrow at this
time and I'll marry you."

The next morning the girl got leggings and moccasins for the young man.
(He had never worn moccasins in Summer.) In the evening he came to where
she was. He washed, put on the leggings and embroidered moccasins and
tied up his hair. She told him then that he could go home with her, but
he must not talk with any of the men, that one of her brothers was
always fooling.

The girl became the orphan's wife and he lived in the chief's house. In
the Fall when the chief's sons were ready to go deer hunting, the young
woman wanted to go. She had a husband and she thought he might be a good
hunter.

The man had never hunted but he said, "I will go and try."

When the party had gone some distance, they camped and began to hunt.
The young man found a place where there were wild grape vines. He made a
swing, then sat in it and swung all day, didn't try to hunt. At night he
went home without game. Each morning he went to the swing and each
evening he went home without game.

The brothers killed many deer. One day one brother said to the other,
"Our brother-in-law gets no game, maybe he doesn't hunt." They agreed to
watch him.

The next morning they followed the young man, found him swinging and saw
that the ground was smooth around the swing. Then they said, "We will
not live with him and feed him. We will leave him, go a day's journey
away and camp."

They left the man and woman with only one leg of deer meat.

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

The young man never ate much; the woman ate most of the meat. When it
was gone, she began to be afraid of starving.

One day, while the man was swinging, a horned owl lighted on a tree
nearby. He shot the owl and put it under the swing where he could look
at it as he swung. His wife was getting very hungry.

That night when he came home without game, she said, "If I have nothing
to eat to-morrow, I will be too weak to get up. You ought to kill
something."

"Well, maybe to-morrow I will kill something."

The next morning the man went, as usual, to the swing. While swinging he
heard a woman crying. He was frightened and stopped swinging. Soon he
saw a female panther coming with three cubs. She was crying. As she
approached, he heard a terrible roar in the North, the direction from
which the panther had come. Then the man saw Whirlwind coming, tearing
down all the trees in his path. He stopped on a tree near the swing.

"You know now what harm you have done," said Whirlwind to Panther.

"Why are you angry with the panther?" asked the young man. "What has she
done to you?"

"She has torn up my best feather cap."

"Why do you think so much of your cap? It must have been a nice one."

"It was nice."

"What kind of feathers was it made of?"

"It was the skin and feathers of a horned owl."

"What would you think if I gave you another cap?"

"How can you get one?"

The young man picked up the horned owl that he had killed and threw it
at Whirlwind. Whirlwind caught it, said, "Thank you, this is better than
the one Panther destroyed," and away he flew.

Panther thanked the man, and said, "I am glad that you had the owl, you
have saved my life. Now I will help you. Go to that knoll yonder, behind
it you will find two bucks fighting. Shoot them both. The one you shoot
first will not run; they will fight till they die."

The young man found the bucks and watched them till

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

they killed each other. Then, taking a large piece of meat, He went home
to his wife, who was almost starved.

"I have brought you meat," said he, "I had good luck to-day."

The woman sprang up, threw the meat on the fire and hardly waited for it
to cook till she began to eat.

They dragged the bucks home, skinned them, and had plenty of meat. The
young woman dried the meat and tanned the skins.

Panther told the main to always hunt near the swing and he would kill a
great deal of game.

When they had a large quantity of meat, the man said to his wife, "Your
brothers are good hunters. No doubt they have plenty of meat, but I will
find them and see."

He started. On the way he killed a deer, and he carried the carcass
along. He found the camp and looking in saw the brothers; they were poor
and weak.

He went in, and asked, "How are you?"

"We are almost starved," said one of them. "We can find nothing to
kill."

"Your sister and I have a plenty. Come and live with us. I have meat
here. Eat and then come to my camp."

He gave them the deer and they ate the meat nearly raw, they were so
hungry.

When they started for the young man's camp he went ahead, got home
quickly and told his wife he had found her brothers nearer starvation
than she had been. During the night the brothers came. They were
satisfied and remained with their sister and brother-in-law.

After a while they all went back to the village loaded with skins and
venison. Now the young man was rich; and he and his wife lived ever
after in Geneseo Valley.
