# DAGWANOE<sup>n</sup>YENT (WHIRLWIND) <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7)

TWO brothers, one a young man, the other a small boy were one day out in
the woods together. They heard a great noise overhead and looking up saw
a DAGWANOE<sup>n</sup>YENT, an enormous head, flying above them.

The elder brother called out "*Gówe*! *gówe*!"

The DAGWANOEnYENT said, "Thank you. Thank you. You should always sing in
that way when you are going to fight. If you do, I will be on your side
and kill your enemies for you."

Taking three hairs from his head the DAGWANOE<sup>n</sup>YENT gave them
to the brothers, saying, "When you want to escape from danger, get water
and draw these hairs along in it. When you take them out, drops of water
will hang to them and those drops will bring rain." Then the
DAGWANOE<sup>n</sup>YENT went on, leaving the two brothers.

By those hairs the brothers often escaped from their enemies.

Whenever they wanted rain, they had only to draw the hairs through water
and then shake off the drops; right away heavy rain fell. The hairs were
long kept by the Senecas.

 

The narrator thinks there is one hair yet. It is owned by a man who
lives on the Alleghany Reservation.
