# THE WOMAN AND DOG IN THE MOON

A WOMAN is sitting in the moon and she is busy embroidering with
porcupine quills. Near her is a bright fire, and over the fire hangs a
kettle with something boiling in it. By her side sits a large dog that
watches her continually. Once in a while she gets up, lays aside her
work and stirs whatever is boiling in the kettle. While she is doing
this the dog unravels her work.

This is going on all the time. As fast as the woman embroiders, the dog
unravels. If she could finish her work, or if she ever does, the end of
the world will come that instant.
