DAGWANOE<sup>n</sup>YENT (Whirlwind), an old woman, the oldest of all
her people, lived in the forest with her two grandchildren, a boy and a
girl.

One day when the grandmother was out digging roots a
GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWA (Frost and Great Cold) woman came to the cabin,
picked up the little girl and, after speaking kindly, telling her she
was a nice little thing, swallowed her.

Then she began to talk to the boy. Sitting down by him, she said, "Get
on to my back and I will carry you to where your grandmother is digging
roots."

The boy did as GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWA told him to, but he was frightened,
and he clung to her so tightly that he became fastened to her back, and
couldn't get off, though he tried hard.

GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWA started off, but in a different direction from
where the boy's grandmother was. When the boy told her she was going the
wrong way, she said, "No, I am not, we will soon come to where she is at
work."

The woman went far into the forest and the boy began to cry for his
grandmother. He cried so hard and loud

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

that GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWA told him to get off of her back. She didn't
like to hear him cry, and she thought it was best to eat him at once.

He couldn't get off and she couldn't put her hands around to pull him
off, nor turn her head to bite him.

When the boy saw that she couldn't harm him if he stayed where he was,
he clung all the tighter and stopped trying to get away.

When the grandmother came home and found that the boy and girl were not
in the cabin, she was frightened and began to search for them. After a
while she came upon the tracks of the GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWA woman and
then she knew who had stolen the children and she followed the tracks,
thinking she would soon overtake the thief.

The woman was tired of the boy and tried in every way to free herself of
him. She rubbed him against hickory trees and against rocks. He said,
"Oh, I like that, rub harder." She stopped then and traveled on.

The grandmother followed in the form of a Whirlwind GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWA
said to the boy, "Your grandmother is coming. She will kill us both. Get
off of my back."

The boy kept still, didn't answer. The woman looked around for a hiding
place and found one in a deep ravine. She dug a hole, went into it and
covered herself with the earth that slipped down from above. When she
heard Whirlwind coming nearer and nearer she asked the boy, "Can you
hear your grandmother coming?"

He didn't answer.

When Whirlwind rushed over the place where the woman lay, the boy
shouted to her. She heard him and, changing her course, came straight to
where they were. When she asked the boy if he was there, the woman told
him to keep still, but he called out, "I am here!"

Whirlwind blew the earth from the hiding place and shouted,
"DAGWANOE<sup>n</sup>YENT, get off of GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWA's back!" That
instant the boy slipped off and went among the rocks. The old woman
hurled stones at the GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWA, tore off her clothes and
killed her. Then she took her grandson and started for home.

On the way, she said to him, "Never let yourself be treated in that
manner again. Never let anyone abuse

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

you. You can conquer everybody if you use your power, for you are of the
Whirlwind family."

The old woman stayed at home for a time, caring for her grandson.

Meanwhile some of the GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWA woman's people found her
trail and followed it till they came to where her body was. They asked
who had killed her and her spirit answered, "Whirlwind killed me." Right
away the GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWA men decided to kill old woman Whirlwind.

Whirlwind, out on one of her journeys, discovered their plans. She went
home and said to her grandson, "We must get your sister out of
GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWA 's stomach, she is sitting there and crying for
me."

They set out and when they reached the place where the body lay, the old
grandmother built a fire and began to burn tobacco, saying, "This is
what we like! This is what we like!" She burned half a pouchful and
pushed the smoke toward the body, repeating, "This is what we like."
Then she called, "My grandchild, come out of GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWA's
body!"

When the girl didn't come, the old woman said to her grandson, "We must
have people come and help us. We have many relatives, uncles, aunts, and
cousins, we will call them." Then she called each relative by name, and
one after another they came. They built a fire at GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWA's
head, and burned tobacco, as they walked around the fire each threw in
tobacco, saying, "Ne vonoes, ne vonoes" (This is what we like).

When the last one had thrown in tobacco, the girl, panting for breath,
came out and asked, "How long have I been here?" She was very weak. They
gave her tobacco smoke and she inhaled it till she gained strength, then
all Whirlwinds went home.

When the old woman and her grandchildren had been at home some time a
GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWA woman came to the cabin, she talked pleasantly,
found out there were only three persons there and left thinking it would
be a small task to kill them.

After the woman had gone, Whirlwind said to her grandchildren, "We are
in trouble now. A great number of those people will come against us.
They have assembled

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

somewhere nearby. When the struggle begins I don't know that we will be
able to come home again." She went out and called,
"DAGWANOE<sup>n</sup>YENT GOWA! DAGWANOE<sup>n</sup>YENT GOWA!"

The girl asked, "Grandmother, what are you doing?"

"I am calling our relatives," answered the old woman,

The Whirlwinds came, one by one, when all were there the old woman said,
"Each one of you must have a big round stone to strike with."

They had just picked up the stones when the GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWAs began
to come; there were thousands and thousands of them.

The Whirlwinds were frightened when they saw how. strong the enemy was.
The old woman said, "We must separate and fight singly. Keep the stones
in your hands, Be firm and have faith that you will kill one man with
each blow you strike."

The Whirlwinds went in different directions; the GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWAs
chased them.

The Whirlwinds struck whenever they had the chance and kept retreating,
they went up a high mountain, fighting as they went. The old woman said,
"When we all reach the top we will go down a short distance on the other
side. When the GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWAs come to the top we will strike them
on the east and on the west, some of us will get behind them and drive
them over the mountain and into the deep ravine on the other side, they
will die there for a river runs through the ravine and they cannot cross
it.

The GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWAs came to the top of the mountain and seeing
nothing of the Whirlwinds, thought they had escaped. They stood and
listened. Soon they heard wind on each side of them. The sound grew
louder and louder and right away the DAGWANOE<sup>n</sup>YENTs struck
them on both sides and, uniting in the rear, struck them from behind.,
So fierce was the attack and power of the Whirlwinds that they tore out
all the trees by their roots, swept the earth from the top of the
mountain and hurled trees and earth into the ravine and river below. The
GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWAs Were piled up, like rocks, in the river and along
the banks.

The Whirlwinds were dancing and rejoicing on the top

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

of the mountain when the old woman said, "We have hurled our enemies
into the ravine, now we will finish them. Half of you go along the
ridges east of the river and the other half go along the western ridges
and blow all the trees and rocks and earth into the ravine."

They went, and when they came together again they had stripped the
mountain spurs naked and filled up the ravine. The river had no outlet;
it became a great lake and ever after was called, "The grave of the
GÉNO<sup>n</sup>SKWAs."
