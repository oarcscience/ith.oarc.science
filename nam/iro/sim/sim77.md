A GRANDMOTHER and granddaughter were living together. They had a skin
blanket, but it was old and a good deal of the hair was worn off.

The two women went to the forest to camp and cut wood and they carried
the blanket to cover themselves with at night. They had been in the
forest only a few days when they found that their skin blanket was alive
and was angry. They threw the blanket down and ran toward home as fast
as they could go. Soon they heard the skin following them.

When it seemed very near the grandmother began to sing and her song
said, "My granddaughter and I are running for our lives, My
granddaughter and I are running for our lives."

When the song ended, the women could scarcely hear the skin following
them, but not long afterward they heard it again. When they reached home
the skin, now a bear, was so near that as they pushed open the door it
clawed at them and scratched their backs, but they got in.

The old woman and her granddaughter were chipmunks. Since that time
Chipmunks have stripes on their backs, the result of the scratches given
by the bear.
