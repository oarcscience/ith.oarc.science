# A MAN PURSUED BY HIS UNCLE AND BY HIS WIFE

### \[Told by Johnny John who learned it from his grandmother, "who lived to be one hundred and thirty years old."\]

AN old man and his nephew lived together in a forest. Their house had a
partition through the middle and a door at each end. The uncle never
entered the part occupied by his nephew, and all communication between
the two was held by each hearing through the partition what the other
said to himself. Each went in and out of his own part of the house when
he liked, but neither ever crossed the threshold of the other part.

After a time the nephew discovered his uncle's true nature--he was a
man-eater.

One day a woman came to the young man's part of the house. The next
morning the uncle said, "My nephew has two ways of breathing."

The young man, speaking to himself, said, "My uncle is mistaken, I am
talking to myself."

"My nephew can't deceive me," said the old man.

There are two persons in his part of the house. I am glad that game has
come to him--I am going hunting."

When his uncle had gone, the young man said to his wife, "My uncle knows
that you are here, now you must do as I tell you. If you don't he will
kill and eat you. Three women have been here. He killed and ate each one
of them, for they paid no heed to what I told them. Before I go away to
hunt, I will bring wood and water and whatever you want, so you need not
go out. If you

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

go out, you are lost. My uncle will kill you. As soon as I leave the
house he will come back."

The young man started off, but turned back and a second time warned his
wife not to disobey him.

The minute the nephew was out of sight in the forest, the uncle came to
the door. The old man had the power of commanding things to be done and
the person had to obey though they didn't hear or see him.

He said, "Let the woman come out!"

But the woman had power also. When he saw that she didn't come out, he
said, "Let the water she is cooking with boil away!"

The water boiled away, but the woman had a plenty more. The old man was
angry, and said, "I will get her out in one way or another."

As the young man was coming home, he saw smoke rising from his part of
the house. "All is well," thought he. "My uncle has not been able to
kill my wife." When he went into the house he praised the woman for her
obedience.

That afternoon, about dusk, they heard the old man come into his part of
the house and they knew that he hadn't brought any game. He hunted only
for people. He called out, "What luck has my nephew had to-day."

"I have had good luck," answered the young man.

The old man began to mutter to himself, to blame his nephew for hiding
his uncle's game. At last he said, "I will wait a while then I will have
my own."

He heard two persons breathe and he was angry. Determined to have
something to eat he pounded bones into bits, put the bits into a kettle,
filled the kettle with water and hanging it over the fire made soup.

The young man and his wife were silent. The man had decided to leave his
uncle and his plans were laid. He had walked in circles around the house
making each circle larger than the preceding one till he had a ring
three days' journey in circuit and now he told his wife what she must
do.

That night the uncle said, "I am going away for a while. I can find no
game around here."

"Well," answered the nephew, "hunters, go where they

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

can find something to kill and they are often gone a long time. I am
going farther myself. Game is getting scarce in our neighborhood."

The young man had power. He caused a house to appear in a place six
days' journey away, then he told his wife about the house, and said, "I
have a brother there and I am going to send you to him. This brother is
invisible. No stranger has ever seen him. Hitherto he has accompanied
me, but now fie will aid you."

The young man took an arrow from his quiver, shook his wife till she was
only a couple of inches long, then, taking off the flint point of the
arrow, he put her inside the arrow and replacing the point, said, "In
three days I will follow you."

Putting his arrow on the bow string he drew it and sent the arrow to the
East. That instant the call of a woodpecker was heard. The feathers on
the arrow were from that bird, and all the way the arrow sang with the
voice of a woodpecker.

The young man could see the trail that the arrow left as it went through
the air. He went back to the cabin, and waited. In three days his uncle
came, but without game.

Talking to himself he asked, "What luck has my nephew had?"

"Good luck," said the young man. "I have a plenty to eat."

"I found nothing," said the old man. "This hunting ground is barren, my
eyes see no more game. But if I have no fresh meat I have bones. I'll
break them up and make soup."

Then the nephew heard his uncle breaking bones--there was a terrible
noise. At last the young man said, "My uncle makes too much noise."

"My nephew wouldn't make less noise if he were in my place. I am trying
to get something to eat." And paying no attention to what his nephew
said, the old man kept at work. The next morning, at daybreak, he said,
"I am going hunting. I shall be gone three days."

"I am glad," thought the young man, and as soon as his uncle was out of,
sight he took the trail that he had

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

made and followed it three days. Then he went directly toward his new
cabin. Glancing up he saw the arrow's trail, which looked like a rainbow
in the sky. After a while he made a long leap and as he leaped he ran in
the air, went up far above the forest and off on a level which was still
in the air.

The trail of the arrow was in the form of a rainbow and it seemed to
roll up and dissolve in mist as the young man passed over it. It ended
where the arrow had struck. In the cabin at the end of the trail he
found his wife.

The invisible brother saw the arrow when it struck the ground and burst.
He saw the woman come out of the arrow and take her natural size. When
she came into the house, he said to her, "I knew you were coming. By
obedience to your husband you have been able to make this journey. No
one has ever seen me before except my brother and he only two or three
times. I know what will come from my uncle's wrath. He will pursue, and,
if possible, kill you."

The old man came home and began to talk to his nephew. When he received
no answer he was very angry. He knew that his nephew was not at home,
and going out he looked for his trail, struck it and found that the
footprints were as old as his own, made three days before. Going back to
the house he muttered, "I'll follow him to-morrow. The world is small.
He cannot escape me. I'll follow him everywhere."

The invisible brother, though a great distance away, heard his uncle
talking to himself, heard his threats, heard him say, "My
daughter-in-law will never get out of my reach. I can go to the edge of
the world very quickly. My nephew is trying to save her. He'll not
succeed. I'll eat her flesh."

The next morning the old man set out. He followed his nephew's
footprints till night, then, looking up, saw that his own house was
near, that he had been going around and around. He was angry, and said,
"To-morrow I will get on the right trail."

As soon as daylight came, the old man started again. As he traveled he
found that the trail was growing dim,

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

but he kept on till midday, then he saw that he was near his own house.

"Be it so!" said he. "Though my nephew is possessed with the witchcraft
of all the animals, I will have his wife's flesh."

He followed the trail three days longer, then he reached the end of it
and cried out, exultantly, "My daughter-in-law's flesh is mine!" Looking
up in the air he saw his nephew's trail. The trail of the arrow was
gone, but the footprints of the nephew remained on the clouds.

As the old man followed on the ground the trail that he saw in the air,
he muttered to himself. The invisible brother heard his threats and the
three started for a lake that was not far away. The woman took the lead;
the husband stepped in her footprints. When they came to the lake, the
young man took a clam shell and threw it toward the opposite bank.
Immediately the banks came together and the three stepped over. When
they had crossed and the lake had again resumed its natural size they
looked back but could scarcely see, at one look, <span
id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) the bank they had left. The young man,
thinking that when his uncle came to the lake he would be long in
crossing, left his wife and went to hunt for game.

The old man came to the lake and ran back and forth looking for a place
to cross. At last he called out, "Daughter-in-law, Daughter-in-law, how
did you cross the lake?" And though the woman knew he wanted to kill
her, she thought, "Why doesn't he throw a clam shell!"

He heard distinctly what she said in her mind and picking up a clam
shell he threw it. The banks came together and when the woman looked to
see where the old man was she was terrified to find him right there at
her side.

He caught her by the hair, and said, "I knew that I should eat your
flesh. My nephew has no right to keep game from me."

With one blow he cut off the woman's head. She had been left alone. The
invisible brother was not there to warn her.

The woman had twin boys. The old man hid the children

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

in a hollow tree, together with the woman's head, then putting the body
on his back, he went to the lake, and picking up a clam shell threw it
toward the opposite bank. The banks came together and he stepped over.
As he looked back, he saw the lake spread out again.

The young man thought that when near home he would see smoke rising from
his cabin, but he did not. "My uncle's words have come true," thought
he. "She forgot my warning." He was lonesome and discouraged and he
determined never to go back to his uncle's house.

While cooking supper, the young man had to go for water. As he stooped
down to dip it up he heard a voice say, "Your uncle has killed me! Your
uncle has killed me!"

On looking around he saw that the willows were bespattered with blood,
and he knew from the blood out of which the voice came that his wife had
been killed. He had two proofs now, his uncle's tracks and the speaking
blood.

The young man continued to hunt and as he had good luck he didn't go
again to the house across the lake. One day when he came from hunting he
saw tracks around his fire, two little trails. Though he saw fresh
tracks each evening he paid no attention to them. They looked like the
tracks of a child but he thought that a little animal made them. At last
he noticed that some of his meat was gone and that each day more and
more disappeared. Then he resolved to catch the thief. Pieces of meat
hung up to dry had been pulled down, dragged out of the house and then
pulled along on the ground.

The young man followed the trail till he came to a big log. The log, was
hollow and the trail disappeared at the opening. He was sure that some
animal lived in the tree. The next day he started off, as usual, but
after going a short distance into the forest he stopped to watch his
house. Soon he saw two little boys come out of the log and run toward
the house. They went in and after a while came out dragging a piece of
meat. When they reached the log they disappeared in the opening, pulling
the meat in after them. The man thought, "To-morrow I will catch those
children,"

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

He knew they could talk, for as they pulled the meat along he heard one
of them say, "Hurry, father will come!"

The next morning the young man went a short distance into the forest,
hid and waited. The time seemed long, but at last the boys came from the
log, ran to the house, went in and closed the door. The man hurried
home, went into the house and fastened the door behind him. As soon as
the children saw him, they began to cry.

"Why do you cry?" asked he, "I am your father. Don't cry."

When they stopped crying, he asked, "How do you know that I am your
father?"

One boy was a little larger than the other, and when the man questioned
them he answered, "An old man killed our mother. He cut off her head and
hid it in a hollow log and he put us in there too. Our mother's head is
in the tree now."

"What do you do with the meat you take from here?"

"We feed it to our mother."

"You must stay with me now," said the father. He was kind to them and
the boys were glad to stay. He made them playthings, bow and arrows and
a ball and club. Whenever he went hunting, they carried meat to their
mother.

One day the larger boy said to his father, "My mother is hungry."

"Feed her," said he. "Feed her all she will eat. We have a plenty of
meat. You can take as much as you want."

Soon the man saw that the meat was disappearing very fast, faster than
he could bring it in. He was frightened.

One of the boys noticed this, and said, "My mother eats a great deal, we
can't carry her enough." And he asked his father to go and see her.

The man went to the log and looking in saw two great eyes in a skull.

"What can we do?" asked one of the boys.

"I am afraid," said the father, "that after she has eaten all the meat
she will eat us."

"We must go to some place far away," said the boys,

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

"so that she will have to travel a long time to overtake us. We can't
feed her. She never gets enough, and we are tired."

The man knew that it would soon be impossible to satisfy the Head, so he
said, "We will go away from here. You will start in the morning and
travel till you come to a large village. My dogs will go with you as far
as the village, then they will come back to help me."

The boys started and after they had gone quite a distance and were
tired, the larger dog said to the larger boy, "Sit on my back."

Then the smaller dog said to the smaller boy, "Sit on my back."

The boys did as told. The dogs ran on swiftly. After a long time they
came to a place where trees had been felled, then they said to the boys,
"We are near a village. You must walk now."

The boys were unwilling to walk, but the dogs, shaking themselves as if
they had just been in water, threw them off and told them to go to the
village. The dogs turned then and went back to their master.

The man knew that by going South he would find uncles who would help
him, just such powerful men as his old uncle. When the dogs came back,
they told their master that they would stay till the last meat was gone,
but he must go, for as soon as the meat was eaten the Head would fly in
the direction he took. They would delay it all they could, but he must
travel fast for his life was in danger.

The man started toward the South and went with great swiftness, for he
was a fast runner. Two days after he left, one of the dogs overtook him,
and said, "The meat is gone and the Head is trying to find the boys. It
can follow as far as they walked but no farther. Be on your guard for it
will find your trail."

The dog could see a great distance, it looked back, and said, "The Head
is coming! You have always said that no one could outrun you. The time
has come when you must exert all your strength."

When the Head started, the dogs left behind did what they could to delay
it. They bit it and when it turned to pursue them, they dodged into the
ground. It went

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

on and again they sprang at it and when it turned they again escaped
into the ground. The trail of the Head could be seen plainly for the
bark was gnawed from the trees where the dogs kept it back, delayed it
and made it angry.

All at once, far off in the West, one of the little boys said to the
other, "Our father is in trouble, our mother is following him."

Soon a dog came up to the man, and said, "The Head is possessed of such
power that we don't know how to keep it back. We are doing what we can,
but you must run with all your strength."

The man ran with all speed. Seeing a house he darted into it and called
out to an old man sitting there, "Uncle, help me! A terrible Head is
following me to take my life!"

"I will help you all I can," said the old man, "but hurry to the next
house, your aunts live there; they will help you. If I am killed, a dark
cloud will go up to the sky."

The man was about half way between the two houses when he heard a
terrible noise and looking back saw that the Flying Head had reached his
uncle's house and his uncle was fighting it with all his strength. When
he turned a second time he saw a great black cloud rise into the sky and
he knew that his uncle was dead.

That minute one of the dogs came to the man, and said, "Your uncle is
dead. He was never beaten before."

When the Head had devoured the old man's flesh, it rushed after the
husband.

The man ran as fast as he could. When almost exhausted, he saw a house,
ran into it and called to the women sitting there, "Help me! help me!
Something is following me to take my life!"

"Poor man," said one of his aunts. "Hurry on. We will do what we can to
delay the Head. Go to the next house. Your mother lives there. Maybe she
can help you."

The man wasn't out of sight of the house when he heard a great noise and
heard his aunts call to their children to have courage. The Head flew
into the house, and bit at everything it came in contact with. The women
beat it

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

with clubs. The man heard the blows fall on the skull. When he was half
way to his mother's house, all was still at his aunts' house. Suddenly
his invisible brother called out, "Run! Run or we are lost!"

The invisible brother urged the man forward, pushed him and he seemed to
run faster. The brother urged and pushed till they reached the house.

Then the man cried, "Mother, help me, help me!"

"Poor Son, you are in great trouble," said the mother. "Go on, we will
do what we can."

The man hurried through the house. The Head came in as he went out. The
dogs ran around the house and urged their master on.

The mother called to her children, "Kill the Head if you can! Fight with
all your strength!"

They took their most poisonous weapons and began to strike the Head. One
of the women stumbled and fell; the Head devoured her in an instant.

The old mother cautioned her children, telling them to be careful and
make no misstep. The youngest girl, remembering there was bears' oil in
the house, thought she would boil it and see if she couldn't kill the
Head with boiling oil. While the Head was chasing the women through the
house, the oil began to boil, then the girl seized the kettle and threw
the oil onto the Head. It burned and killed the Head.

'Your brother is free," said the mother. "We ought to have a game of
ball. It is our duty to give thanks. The Head will be the ball."

She picked up the Head, carried it out and called in a loud voice,
"Here, warriors, is a ball for you to play with."

Soon a great many people, with netted clubs in their hands, came and
began to play ball. (These players were animals that lived in the
forest.) The man saw them play with his wife's head. Each one struggled
to get the ball and in that way they wore it out.

One of the dogs said to him, "Your wife is dead and you are safe."

When it said, "Your wife is dead," the man's strength left him, his arms
dropped down, and he was very sad.

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

"You are sorry," said the invisible brother, "but I am glad. Why should
you be sad? She would have devoured you, if they had not killed her. Now
there is no one to harm us. Our uncle will not trouble us again."

"Your children are living off in that direction," said he, pointing to
the West. "Go and find them." So saying he turned and when the brother
looked after him, he had disappeared.

The man and his dogs traveled toward the West. When the dogs left the
children they were near a house at the edge of a village. In that house
lived an old woman and her granddaughter. One day when the girl was in
the woods stooping down to pick up broken boughs, she heard voices. She
listened and, as the wind came toward her, she discovered that they were
the voices of children. She went home with her wood, told her
grandmother that she had heard children crying, and asked her to come to
the forest and listen.

"It is a pleasure to know that there are children alive. They must be
for us," said the grandmother. "We will go and find them."

When they came to the place where the girl had heard the voices, she
said, "Now listen!"

"True," said the grandmother, "there are children in the woods. We must
look everywhere till we find them. Maybe they are sent to us because we
are alone."

The girl followed the sound, going in the direction from which the wind
came, she could hear distinctly and she knew the sound came from near
the ground. At last she came to where the boys were. They were
apparently about a year old, one a little larger than the other and both
were crying. The girl began to comfort the children, to tell them she
would be their mother and be kind to them.

While she was talking, her grandmother came. She pitied the children and
'said to them, "Stop crying. It is the will of the Great Spirit that you
should be our children. I will be your grandmother and my granddaughter
will be your mother."

"All we have we will give to you," said the girl. "I will love you as
your mother would."

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

The boys stopped crying and went home with the girl. Each boy had the
little bow and arrow and ball club that his father had made for him.

"We will take good care of these children," said the grandmother. "There
are many people in our village, but not a child. I have lived here a
long time, but I have never seen a little child."

When the boys were old enough to hunt for birds, their grandmother gave
them bows and arrows and they brought in a good deal of game.

One day the larger boy called, "Grandmother, come and see what I have
killed. It is covered with spots. It is over here in the weeds."

"Where is it? Where is it?" asked the grandmother.

The boys led the way, but she could hardly keep in sight of them, the
weeds were so high. On reaching the spot she found a fawn a few hours
old. She carried the fawn home, and said to herself, "I am thankful that
I have these children. They will be great hunters; their game is getting
larger. First they killed birds, now they have killed a fawn."

One day the larger boy said, "Our father is coming."

"I am afraid our father is dead," answered the other boy.

The grandmother overheard this and told the boys to go and hunt for
birds, she was hungry for bird meat.

The next day, while the children were out, a man came to the house. The
invisible brother had told the man that when he came to the old woman's
house he must say, "Grandmother, I am glad to see you," and to the girl,
"Sister, I am glad to see you." As the man went in, he saluted the old
woman as Grandmother, and to the girl he said, Sister.

One of the boys said to the other, "Our father has come!"

"I don't think so," said his brother, "Our father had dogs; there are no
dogs with this man." To find out he raised the skin door a little and
looking in he saw his father sitting there with his elbow on his knee
and his face on his hand.

"We must find the dogs," said the larger boy.

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

They followed their father's tracks and they hadn't gone far when they
found that the dogs had run off in another direction. They tracked the
dogs and toward night found them standing by a fallen tree. The dogs
heard the children's voices and ran to meet them. They were as glad to
see the boys as the boys were to see them.

"We must go home," said the brothers, but they didn't know the way.

The dogs took the lead. It was late at night and very dark when they got
home.

When the boys didn't come, the grandmother and granddaughter were
frightened. They were waiting for daylight -to come so they could hunt
for them. When they came, the grandmother asked, "Why did you stay so
long and frighten us?"

The father was happy to be with his children again. The girl was the
man's sister and the old woman was his grandmother.

They all lived together now and were happy.
