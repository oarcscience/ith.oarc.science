A GRANDFATHER and grandson lived far away from any village. All the
people of their nation had been carried off. The grandfather was very
careful of his grandson for he was the only comfort he had.

One day the boy ran into the cabin, and said, "Grandfather, I heard
something out in the woods crying, '*kidjidi*! *kidjidi*!'"

"Oh," said the grandfather, "that was a chickadee, that is the first
game hunters kill."

The boy went out with his bow and arrows and after many attempts he
killed a chickadee. When he took it home the old man danced with joy,
singing as he danced, "My grandson will be a great hunter! My grandson
will be a great hunter!"

Another day the boy ran in crying, "O Grandfather, I've seen something
with four legs, and a tail with four black stripes around it!

"That was a coon," said the grandfather. "That is the second game
hunters kill."

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

The boy killed a coon, and the old man danced and sang, "Oh, my grandson
will be a great hunter! Oh, my grandson will be a great hunter!"

The next day the boy ran in crying, "O, Grandfather, I've seen a strange
thing walking on two legs. Red skin hangs from its head, and it makes a
great noise."

"That was a turkey," said the grandfather. "That is the third game a
hunter kills."

The boy went to the woods and when he saw a flock of turkeys, he ran
till he caught one of them. Again the old man danced and sang, "My
grandson will be a great hunter."

The boy went out another day and saw a long creature with thin legs and
something, like the branches of a tree, on its head. He was frightened;
he ran home and told his grandfather what he had seen. The old man said,
"That is the fourth and largest game; that was a deer. When a man can
kill a deer he is a good hunter."

The next clay the boy killed a deer.

The old man didn't dance or sing this time; it was a solemn occasion. He
taught the boy how to dress the deer and stretch the skin, then he said,
"You are a young man now. You needn't run in to tell me what you have
seen, kill anything that comes along. A man that can kill a deer can
kill all kinds of game. When hunting you can go in any direction except
the North, wicked women live in the North; women who have killed many of
our people."

The young man went toward the South, but he kept thinking about the
women who had killed his relatives and at last he turned and went North.
After a time he came to a tree that was covered with scratches, like the
scratches made by a coon's nails. He said in his mind, "It must be that
there are a great many coons in this tree."

He threw off his blanket, took a stick and his bow and arrows and
climbed up till he came to a hole in the tree; he looked into the hole
and, seeing a number of coons, poked his stick down, killed two or three
of them, pulled them up and threw them to the ground. As he did this he
looked down and he saw, near the foot of the tree, a beautiful young
woman.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

As soon as he saw her, she called out, "Come down, I want to talk to
you."

He paid no attention to the woman, but kept on killing coons. She called
again and again. At last he went to the other side of the tree, turned
himself into a red-headed woodpecker and went up the tree pecking the
bark. When he got to the top he shot an arrow off toward home. The arrow
whizzed through the air, making a noise like a woodpecker.

The woman, thinking that the boy was in the arrow, hurried after it.

The young man took his own form, slipped down from the tree, put on his
clothes, gathered up the coons and went home. The grandfather was glad
to get the coons, but when he knew where his grandson had been he was
angry. "You must not go there again," said he. "If you do, great harm
will come to us."

The next day the young man started off toward the South, but when out of
sight he turned and went North. He went beyond the first tree and came
to a second tree covered with scratches. He climbed the tree and killed
a number of coons, then he looked down and saw, sitting on a log, near
the foot of the tree, the same young woman. As soon as he saw her, she
began to urge him to come down. She talked with enticing words. He knew
that he ought not to go, but the feeling came into his heart that he
wanted to. He went half way and stopped. Again the woman urged. At last
he went to the ground and sat down on the end of the log--the woman was
sitting in the middle.

"Why do you sit so far away?" asked she, "A young man and a young woman
sit near each other when they talk."

He drew a little nearer, then she urged him to come up close to her. At
last he sat by her side. She told him stories and talked till he fell
asleep then she put him in a skin bag, took the bag on her shoulders and
hurried off through the air.

After a long time, the woman came to the ground, took the young man out
of the bag, roused him, and asked, "Do you know this place?"

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

"Yes, my grandfather used to fish here."

"I don't believe it," said the woman, "Point out something you
remember."

"There are the poles we put up; and there is the old kettle we cooked
in." He willed that she should see those things; he bewitched her eyes.

Again she told him stories till she put him to sleep. A second time she
carried him far away. When she came to the ground and opened the bag,
the young man found that he was on the shelf of a high cliff. On narrow
places near him were other men, some alive, some half eaten up. "Oh,"
thought he, "my grandfather was right, there are bad women in the
North." He called to the man nearest him and asked how he came there.

"A woman brought me here; other women brought these other men to where
they are; many men have been eaten up; you and I will be eaten when they
come to us."

The young man thought how he might escape. All at once he remembered
that, on a time, a great spider had appeared to him in a dream, and had
promised to help him when in trouble, and he cried, "O Spider, help me
now!"

Right away an enormous spider was there on the top of the cliff and it
began weaving threads for a rope. When the rope was long enough the
spider let it down and the young man climbed up on it. Then he let the
rope down and drew up the men on the cliff one after another. All the
men went home except the young man. He set out for the home of the woman
who had deceived him.

He found the woman living in an old house with her mother and he said to
her, "I have come to marry you."

The woman said, "I have a very bad mother, I'm afraid that she will kill
you; she sent me to deceive you and carry you to the cliff."

"I'll try to save myself," said the young man.

The old woman slept at the end of the house. In the night she began to
groan and roll around on the ground.

The young woman said, "Strike my mother on the head with the corn
pounder."

He struck her, and asked, "What is the matter, Mother-in-law?"

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

"I dreamed that my son-in-law killed the white beaver in the lake and
made a feast for the DAGWANOE<sup>n</sup>YENTS."

"Go to sleep now," said the son-in-law, "I'll do that to-morrow."

The next morning he went to the lake and killed the beaver with a single
arrow, but as soon as he lifted it out of the water the lake rose up and
pursued him with fury. The young man knew the water was so poisonous
that flesh that it touched instantly dropped from the bones, so he ran
for his life. He reached the house and threw the beaver down. That
minute the water disappeared.

The old woman was raging, she said, "Oh, my poor son, my poor son! I
thought that my son-in-law's bones would be in the lake."

The beaver was dressed and cooked. The man invited the
DAGWANOE<sup>n</sup>YENTS and the GÁSYONDETHAS to come to the feast.
They came; the house was full of horrid heads with long hair. When the
dinner was eaten to the last morsel, the heads began to smack their
lips. "A splendid feast!" said they. "A grand dinner the old woman's son
has made us! How sweet his flesh was!"

The old woman was furious; she seized a club and drove the guests away.

The next night the old woman rolled around the house and down to the
fire, crying, "*Agi*! *Agi*!"

"Oh," said the wife. "This time my mother will dream that you and she
must go to the sweat house, you first and then she. Now strike her with
the corn pounder."

He struck her and she called out, "I dreamed that my son-in-law went to
the sweat house and then I went."

"Go to sleep, Mother-in-law, I'll attend to that to-morrow."

In the morning the sweat house was heated. As soon as the young man went
in, the old woman danced around outside and sang "Let there be heat to
kill him! Let there be heat to kill him!"

When she thought he was dead she went in, but she found him comfortable
and happy. Now it was her turn to sweat. The son-in-law closed the sweat
house, then he danced and sang "Let it become flint, first at a red and
then at a white heat."

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

Right away the house was flint and red hot.

The old woman was burned up.

"Now," said the young man to his wife, "You brought me most of the
journey on your back, you know the way; take me to my home."

She put him on her back, carried him over the fields and the woods, past
the fishing grounds where he had said that his grandfather used to fish,
past the trees scratched by the coons, and at last brought him to his
grandfather's house, and they lived there happily.

 

The women in this story were eagles.
