ONE day a coon was walking out. As he went slowly along the bank of a
stream, he thought of his enemies, the crawfish, and wondered how he
could kill them. At last he stood still and thought out a plan: he would
go along the stream till he found a half-decayed log; he would take some
of the soft, rotten wood, the punk of the log, and rub it over his face
and around his eyes till he looked half-decayed himself, then he would
wait for his enemies.

He hurried along and soon found a log. He rubbed his face with punk then
stretched himself across the log, half of his body hanging down on one
side and his head and neck on the other side. Lying in this lifeless way
he looked as though he had been a long time dead.

By and by a crawfish, that was walking along and looking around, chanced
to see Coon, and he thought, "There is a dead man!" He was surprised,
and said in his own mind, "I'll go and see if he is really dead."

He went to the log. Coon did not stir. Flies were crawling over his face
and body.

"Why, this is our enemy," said Crawfish, "and he is dead! This is good
news to tell. I'll notify all of my people."

He started off immediately. When he thought he was near enough home to
make some one hear, he screamed,

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "*Go-gwa*! *go-gwa*!" then he ran on, every
little while halting to scream "*Go-gwa*! *go-gwa*!"

Some one heard the cry and notified the chief that runner was coming
with important news. The people went to the edge of the village and
waited. When the runner came in sight, the chief said, "Let half of the
people stand on one side of the path and half on the other, that he may
come to me quickly."

When the runner stood in front of the chief of the Crawfish nation the
chief asked, "What news have you brought?"

"Great news! As I came along the creek I saw, not very far from here, a
dead man hanging across a log, I went to the log and found that the dead
man was our enemy, Coon. He has been dead a long time, flies we crawling
over his face."

The chief said, "This is great news, the best we have ever heard. Our
enemy is dead! We will go and look at him. The man who found him will
lead us to the place."

Before starting they sang and as the song ended they gave a shout that
filled the valley and went up to the top of the mountains. Some, in a
hurry to see their enemy, pushed ahead, but the chief ordered them to
stand back and move forward in order.

When the runner said they were half way, the chief told the people to
halt and sing. They sang the same song and again the shout filled the
valley and went to the top of the mountains.

When they came to the place, the chief told the men to form in a circle
around the log, but not to go up to the man hanging across it till they
were sure that he was dead.

After a while each man said to the chief, "He is dead and has been for a
long time."

The chief said, "This is the best thing that has ever happened, but we
must be perfectly sure that coon is dead. We will sing and shout and
then the bravest man among us will go up to the body, reach into the
mouth and, if possible, pull out the heart, then we shall know that our
enemy is dead."

At the end of the song and the shout a man went up and put his hand into
Coon's mouth, but he sprang back

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

with a cry and he looked as though he were frightened and wanted to run
away.

When they asked, "What is the matter?" he said,

"Coon is alive."

The men called him a liar, and said, "You want to fool us Coon is half
rotten, and you say he is alive."

The chief called on another man whom he said always told the truth. The
people sang and shouted, then the man stepped boldly up to the body, but
he sprang back. The chief and the people were astonished when the man
said, "Coon is alive!" There the body hung, head down, no one had seen
it move, and the face was black.

The chief called out a third man, the best man in the Crawfish nation.
The people sang and shouted, then the man went up to the body. He had
just reached out to touch it when Coon sprang up, and dashing in among
his enemies began to fight them. He pulled out their arms, pounded their
heads, and killed them. Of all the Crawfish nation only one man escaped.
That one found himself alone on a high hill and, not knowing which way
to go, was terribly frightened.

"I shall die," thought Crawfish, "for how can I get back to the water. I
shall die here alone." He crawled along slowly, for he was weak and
thirsty. At last he saw a tree, then he said in his own mind, "I'll go
and ask that tree what it is." When he came to the tree he spoke up and
asked, "What kind of a tree are you?" The tree answered, "I am a black
oak."

Crawfish was discouraged-black oaks grow far from water-and he said to
himself, "I shall die here alone," but he crawled along slowly. After a
time he saw another tree and when he came near it, he spoke up and
asked, "What kind of a tree are you?" The tree answered, "I am a
butternut."

Now butternut trees grow nearer the water than oaks do, so Crawfish knew
he was going in the right direction, but his courage almost gave out for
he was so thirsty and weak that he could scarcely move. Still he crawled
on. After a long time he came to another tree, and asked as before,
"What kind of tree are you?" The tree answered, "I am a cottonwood."

Crawfish was encouraged and began to think that maybe he would live till
he came to some stream, for he knew that one was not far away. He
crawled along and soot came to another tree. He asked, "What kind of a
tree are you?" "I am a willow," answered the tree.

Now Crawfish was so glad that he screamed and laughed and called out,
"I'm near water! I'm near water!" Soon he came to low bushes, then he
stood up, jumped as far as be could and came down in water. He was so
thirst that he didn't go to the bottom of the stream, but floated on the
surface till he had taken a long drink. Then he sank to the bottom, and
he still lives there.
