### SECTION 91

"So they proceeded a little ways farther and in a short time they
reached a certain spot and stopped.

"Then said the messengers, 'Look toward the setting sun.'

"So he looked and saw. Now as he looked he seemed to see a man pacing to
and fro. He seemed to be a white man and in his hand he seemed to have a
bayonet with which he prodded the ground. Now moreover he seemed very
angry.

"Then said the messengers, 'What did you see?'

"He answered, 'I saw what seemed to be a man pacing to and fro. He
seemed to be a white man and in his hand he seemed to have a bayonet
with which he prodded the ground, and, moreover, it seemed that he was
angry.' So he said when he answered.

"Then the messengers said, 'It is true. He is a white man and in a
temper. It is true. Indians must not help him and the head

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_79"></span>[66:1](cohl102.htm#fr_79) This section refers to
the "war in the west," probably General Harrison's campaign against
Tecumseh in 1811. Red jacket and all the principal chiefs were anxious
to preserve peace and did all within their power to prevent their young
warriors from enlisting on either side but were not entirely successful.
The issue was of such moment that the prophet deemed it wise to reveal
the will of the four messengers in the matter.
