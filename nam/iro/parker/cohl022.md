### SECTION 11

"'Now another message to tell your people.

"'This concerns short marriages.

"'Now some live together peaceably and keep the family as should be.
Then after a time the man resolves to go off on a hunting excursion in
the woods for a certain number of days. So he goes, having agreed with
his wife about it. All is well and he returns with a load of game. He
feels well and thinks he is doing well in thus providing for his family.
On his way homeward he meets some one who tells him that in his absence
his wife has been living with another man. When he hears this report he
feels sad and angry. He refuses to go to his home and turns from his
path and goes to his relatives. Now whoever makes mischief of this kind
does a great wrong before the Creator. So he bids his people to forever
stop such evil practices.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
