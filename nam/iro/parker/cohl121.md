"Verily he saw those who were upon the earth and those who were alive
and he saw the wicked in the house of torment. He saw
Gowono<sup>n</sup>?'gowa \[she great talker\], Gâkon'go? \[she-glutton
animal\], Gânonjoni'yon \[hanging kettle\] and Hano'e:s \[head-eater\].
Verily he saw these four persons.

and can not be forgiven.'"

So they said. Eniaiehuk.
