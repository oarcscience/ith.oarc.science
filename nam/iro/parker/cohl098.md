### SECTION 87

"So they proceeded and it was not long before they said, 'We must stop
here.' Then they pointed in a certain direction and commanded him to
watch. So he watched and as he did he saw a house with a spire and a
path leading into the house and none out. There was no door, neither
were there any windows in the house. Within was a great noise, wailing
and crying, and the house was hot.

Then the messengers asked him what he saw.

He answered, 'I saw a house with a spire and a path leading to the
house. There was no door, neither were there any windows in the house.
Within was a great noise, wailing and crying, and the house was hot.'

"Then they replied, 'You have truly seen. It is a hard matter for
Indians to embrace these conditions, that is, to embrace the belief of
Bible believers.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
