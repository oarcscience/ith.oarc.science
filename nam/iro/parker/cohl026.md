### SECTION 15

"'Now another message of things not right.

"'Parents disregard the warnings of their children. When a child says,
"Mother, I want you to stop wrongdoing," the child speaks straight words
and the Creator says that the child speaks right and the mother must
obey. Furthermore the Creator proclaims that such words from a child are
wonderful and that the mother who disregards then takes the wicked part.
The mother may reply, "Daughter, stop your noise. I know better than
you. I am the older and you are but a child. Think not that you can
influence me by your speaking." Now when you tell this message to your
people say that it is wrong to speak to children in such words.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
