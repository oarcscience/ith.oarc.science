### SECTION 4

"'Now another word. It is sad. It is the fourth word. It is the way
Yondwi'nias swa'yas. <span id="fr_27"></span>[2](#fn_27.md)

Now the Creator ordained that women should bear children.

Now a certain young married woman had children and suffered much. Now
she is with child again and her mother wishing to prevent further
sufferings designs to administer a medicine to cut off the child and to
prevent forever other children from coming. <span
id="fr_28"></span>[3](#fn_28.md) So the mother makes the medicine and gives
it. Now when she does this she forever cuts away her daughter's string
of children. Now it is because of such things that the Creator is sad.
He created life to live and he wishes such evils to cease. He wishes
those who employ such medicines to cease such practices forevermore. Now
they must stop when they hear this message. Go and tell your people.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_27"></span>[30:2](cohl017.htm#fr_27.md) Meaning "she cuts it
off by abortion."

<span id="fn_28"></span>[30:3](cohl017.htm#fr_28.md) The Iroquois knew of
such an herb. I find it mentioned by Dr Peter Wilson, the Cayuga, and it
was pointed out to me at Onondaga in 1911. The Seneca and Onondaga
belief is that every woman has a certain number of children predestined
to them and that they are fastened on a stringlike runner like tubers,
or like eggs within a bird.
