## Recitation of the third day

#### NOW AT TONAWANDA

### SECTION 78

"Now another message. Tell it to those at Tonawanda.

"Now they said to him, 'Watch a certain place.' So he did and he saw a
certain person holding meat in his hands. The man was rejoicing and was
well clothed and fed and his name was Tâ?dondä'ieha?, and he recognized
him."

"Then said they to him, 'How is it?'

"He answered, 'I recognized Tâ?dondä'ieha? and he held meat in his
hands.' So answered he who talked religiously."

"Then the messengers answered, 'Truly you saw a man with meat enjoying
himself. He was joyous because he was a prosperous and successful hunter
and gave game as presents to his neighbors. So his neighbors were
grateful and thanked him. Now the man you saw has departed from the
earth. In his earth-life he cleansed himself each day, visited and
enjoyed himself in his best clothing. He was ever good to his
fellow-beings and so he is blessed and will receive the reward reserved
for him by his Creator."

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
