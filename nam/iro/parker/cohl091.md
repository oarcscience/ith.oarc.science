### SECTION 80

"Now another message.

"Every person has a song to sing when the time comes to leave the earth.
When a person is departing he must sing that song

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

and continue to sing on his journey to the other world. <span

who believe in Gai'wiio\`."

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_76"></span>[61:1](cohl091.htm#fr_76) Ideas of the soul. The
following ideas of the human soul were anciently held by the Iroquois
and their influence on the teachings of Handsome Lake's teachings will
be noted upon reading the Gai'wiio\`:

Every soul has a path to its destiny after death.

Every soul retains its personal identity whatever form it may inhabit.

Soul differs from life.

When the soul leaves the body life does not necessarily.

When life leaves the body the soul generally does, though not always
immediately but may linger for ten days.

The soul may pass from a living body and enter any object or go to any
place to acquire wisdom and returning reveal it to the person in dreams
or visions.

Should a person refuse persistently to heed these warning visions the
soul is liable to desert him, leaving the person simply a creature
without power to resist or understand the influence of the various
spirits good or bad.

Thinking that by some oversight or evil doing that be may lose his soul
the Indian often offers sacrifice to his evil spirit. This is to satisfy
his evil spirit with other things than wrong doing and thereby not
offend his good spirit.
