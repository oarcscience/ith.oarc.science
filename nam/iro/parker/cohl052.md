### SECTION 41

"'Now another message to tell your people.

"'This thing will happen when it is new.

"'Truly men will repent and reform but it will happen that three certain
ones will neither confess nor reform. Nothing will induce them to
confess.

"'There are grades of sin: <span id="fr_44"></span>[2](#fn_44.md) the sins
of Hasan'owa:n'ê?, the sins of Honon'diont and the sins of the ordinary
people.

"'Now when you are preaching repentance, Gaiänt'wakâ will say that these
men when they pass from this world are most vile. He will say, "Let us
cast them into the water for they are not worthy to be dressed for the
grave. The Creator will not receive them." Now no one will object to
what Gaiänt'wakâ says."'

Now this thing did happen as predicted and when the messenger arose the
first thing that he did was to spread the news and give the command that
it must not be done.

"Now they said, 'The Creator will not give up hope of them until they
pass from the earth. It is only then that they can lose their souls if
they have not repented. So the Creator always hopes for
repentance.'" <span id="fr_45"></span>[3](#fn_45.md)

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
