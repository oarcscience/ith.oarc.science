### SECTION 37

"'Now another message to tell your people.

"'Now this is a thing to happen.

"'Hereafter we shall have a new species of deer. <span
id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41) The Creator will create somewhere a pair,
male and female. The male deer will be spotted with white and the female
striped with white over her back. This will be done and we say it.

"'Now moreover the messengers command that these animals shall never be
killed."'

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_41"></span>[43:1](cohl048.htm#fr_41) These deer are the
sacred creations of the Great Ruler and as such no "pale invader" is
permitted to see them, though a few of the faithful have at certain
seasons seen them in the darkness fleeing from discovery. Cornplanter
says these deer were killed by a jealous rival of the prophet while he
yet lived, so defying the new command.
