# The Code of Handsome Lake, the Seneca Prophet

## ARTHUR C. PARKER

# INTRODUCTION

## HANDSOME LAKE'S RELIGION

The Gai'wiio\` <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) is the record of the
teachings of Handsome Lake, the Seneca prophet, and purports to be an
exact exposition of the precepts that he taught during a term of sixteen
years, ending with his death in 1815. It is the basis of the so-called
"new religion" of the Six Nations and is preached or recited at all the
annual midwinter festivals on the various Iroquois reservations in New
York and Ontario that have adherents. These reservations are Onondaga,
Tonawanda, Cattaraugus and Allegany in New York and Grand River and
Muncytown in Ontario.

There are six authorized "holders" of the Gai'wiio\` among whom are John
Gibson (Ganio\`dai'io\`) and Edward Cornplanter (Soson'dowâ), Senecas,
and Frank Logan (Adoda:r'ho), Onondaga. Chief Cornplanter is by far the
most conservative though Chief Gibson seems to have the greater store of
explanatory matter, often interpolating it during his exposition. Chief
Logan is a devout adherent of his religion and watches the waning of his
prophet's teachings with grave concern. His grief is like that of
Hiawatha (Haiyo<sup>n</sup>'wêntha) and inclines him to leave Onondaga
for a region where the prophet will not be jeered.

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

The stated times for the proclaiming of the Gai'wiio\` are at the Six
Nations' meeting in September and at the midwinter thanksgiving in the
moon Nîsko'wûkni:, between January 15th and February 15th. At such times
the Oñgwe?'oñweka: or "faithful Indians" send for an expounder paying
his traveling expenses and entertaining him during his stay. Usually
reservations "exchange" preachers, Cornplanter going to Grand River or
Onondaga and Chief Gibson to Cattaraugus or Allegany.

The time consumed in reciting the Gai'wiio\` is always three days. At
noon each day the expositor stops, for the sun is in midheaven and ready
to descend. All sacred things must be done sêde:'tcia:, *early in the
morning*. Before sunrise each morning of the preaching the preacher
stands at the fireplace in the long house and sings a song known as the
Sun Song. This is an obedience to a command of the prophet who promised
that it should insure good weather for the day. "The wind always dies
down when I sing that song," affirms Chief Cornplanter.

During the recital of the Gai'wiio\` the preacher stands at the
fireplace which serves as the altar. Sitting beside him is an assistant
or some officer of the rites who holds a white wampum strand. <span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) A select congregation sits on benches placed
across the long house but the majority use the double row of seats
around the walls. The women wear shawls over their heads and during
affecting parts of the story hide their faces to conceal the tears. Some
of the men, stirred to emotion, likewise are moved to tears but are
unable to hide them. Such emotion once detected by the auditors
sometimes becomes contagious and serves as the means of scores
repledging their allegiance to the old religion. In 1909, for example,
136 Allegany Senecas promised Chief Cornplanter that they would stop
drinking liquor and obey the commands of Handsome Lake. Visiting
Canadian Oneida Indians at the Grand River ceremonies, as a result of
such a "revival," petitioned for a visit of the Gai'wiio\` preachers
several years ago, saying that a portion of the Oneida of the Thames
wished to return to the "old way." This some of them have done but they
complain of the persecution of their Christian tribesmen who threatened
to burn their council house. In other places the case seems different
and the "prophet's cause" is not espoused with much enthusiasm by the
younger element to whom the white man's world and thought present a
greater appeal.

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

Those who live in communities in which the prophet's word is still
strong are drawn to the ceremonies and to the recitals because it is a
part of their social system.

Its great appeal to the older people is that it presents in their own
language a system of moral precepts and exhortations that they can
readily understand. The prophet, who is called "our great teacher"
(sedwa'gowa:'nê?), was a man of their own blood, and the ground that he
traversed was their ancestral domain. Patriotism and religious emotion
mingle, and, when the story of the "great wrongs" is remembered, spur on
a ready acceptance. The fraudulent treaty of Buffalo of 1838, for
example, caused many of the Buffalo Senecas to move to the Cattaraugus
reservation. Here they settled at Ganûn'dase:\` or Newtown, then a
desolate wilderness. Their bitter wrongs made them hate white men and to
resist all missionary efforts. Today there is no mission chapel at
Newtown. All attempts have failed. <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md)
Whether future ones will readily succeed is conjectural. The Indian
there clings to his prophet and heeds the word of his teacher. At Cold
Spring on the Allegany is another center of the "old time people." On
the Tonawanda reservation this element is chiefly centered "down below"
at the long house. On the Onondaga reservation the long house stands in
the middle of the Onondaga village and the Ganuñg'sîsne:'ha (long house
people) are distributed all over the reservation but perhaps chiefly on
Hemlock road. It is an odd sight, provoking strange thoughts, to stand
at the tomb of the prophet near the council house and watch each day the
hundreds of automobiles that fly by over the State road. The Tuscarora
and St Regis Indians are all nominally Christians and they have no long
houses.

The present form of the Gai'wiio\` was determined by a council of its
preachers some fifty years ago. They met at Cold Spring, the old home of
Handsome Lake, and compared their versions. Several differences were
found and each preacher thought his version the correct one. At length
Chief John jacket, a Cattaraugus Seneca, and a man well versed in the
lore of his people, was chosen to settle forever the words and the form
of the Gai'wiio\`. This he did by writing it out in the Seneca language
by the method taught by Rev. Asher Wright, the Presbyterian missionary.
The preachers assembled again, this time, according to Cornplanter, at
Cattaraugus where they memorized the parts in which they were faulty.
The original text was written on letter paper and now is entirely
destroyed.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

Chief jacket gave it to Henry Stevens and Chief Stevens passed it on to
Chief Cornplanter who after he had memorized the teachings became
careless and lost the papers sheet by sheet. Fearing that the true form
might become lost Chief Cornplanter in 1903 began to rewrite the
Gai'wiio\` in an old minute book of the Seneca Lacrosse Club. He had
finished the historical introduction when the writer discovered what he
had done. He was implored to finish it and give it to the State of New
York for preservation. He was at first reluctant, fearing criticism, but
after a council with the leading men he consented to do so. He became
greatly interested in the progress of the translation and is eager for
the time to arrive when all white men may have the privilege of reading
the "wonderful message" of the great prophet.

The translation was made chiefly by William Bluesky, the native lay
preacher of the Baptist church. It was a lesson in religious toleration
to see the Christian preacher and the "Instructor of the Gai'wiio\`"
side by side working over the sections of the code, for beyond a few
smiles at certain passages, in which Chief Cornplanter himself shared,
Mr Bluesky never showed but that he reverenced every message and
revelation of the four messengers.
