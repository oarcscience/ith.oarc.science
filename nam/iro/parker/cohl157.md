### DEGI'YA?GO<sup>n</sup> OÄ\`'NO?, THE BUFFALO SOCIETY

The ritual of this society consists of a number of songs which relate
the story of the origin of the order. After a ceremony in which there is
a dance, the members depart, carrying with them the buffalo pudding. The
dancers imitate the action of buffalo when stamping off flies, and the
pudding is supposed to be of the consistency of the mud in which the
buffalo stamps. When it is eaten it acts as a charm that "stamps off"
disease or ill fortune. The Buffalos use the water drum and horn
rattles.
