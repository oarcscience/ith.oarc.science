### SECTION 10

"'Now another message to tell your people.

"'The married often live well together for a while. Then a man becomes
ugly in temper and abuses his wife. It seems to afford him pleasure. Now
because of such things the Creator is very sad. So he bids us to tell
you that such evils must stop. Neither man nor woman must strike each
other.' So they said.

"Now furthermore they said, 'We will tell you what people must do. It is
the way he calls best. Love one another and do not strive for another's
undoing. Even as you desire good treatment, so render it. Treat your
wife well and she will treat you well.'

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
