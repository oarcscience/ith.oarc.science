### SECTION 19

"'Now another message.

"'Now the Creator of mankind ordained that people should live to an old
age. He appointed that when a woman becomes old she should be without
strength and unable to work. <span
id="fr_30"></span>[1](cohl031.htm#fn_30.md) Now the Creator says that it is
a great wrong to be unkind to our grandmothers. The Creator forbids
unkindness to the old. We, the messengers, say it. The Creator appointed
this way: he designed that an old woman should be as a child again and
when she becomes so the Creator wishes the grandchildren to help her,
for only because she is, they are. Whosoever does right to the aged does
right in the sight of the Creator.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.

(So many words, Odi'waga?'de, end of first day's preaching)
