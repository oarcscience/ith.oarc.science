### SECTION 56

"'Now another message.

"This happened when Gai'wiio\` was new. It was the time when he dwelt at
Diono<sup>n</sup>?'sodegê\`. <span id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_60.md)

"A father and son appeared in Diono<sup>n</sup>?'sodegê\`. Now the name
of the son was Gani'seoñ. They were on a hunting journey and came from
Gadäges'käo<sup>n</sup> <span id="fr_61"></span>[2](#fn_61.md) with a horse
and cart. Now they tarried in Diono<sup>n</sup>?'sodegê\` for several
nights before again taking up their journey.

"It was during the hunting season that the news spread that some one had
returned from the hunting grounds without a companion. It was the young
man who had returned. So they questioned him and asked where his father
was. He answered, 'My father is lost. I went about searching for my
father a number of days. I walked and searched and signalled with gun
discharges hoping to find him. I could not find him and became weary
waiting for his return.' So he said."

"Now Gaiänt'wakâ when he heard this said, 'It is apparent to me that the
young man has spoken the untruth.' So then they all went to the diviner
of mysteries and Gaiänt'wakâ spoke to him saying, 'It is my opinion that
the boy has murdered his own father.' And the prophet answering said,
'They have not yet given me the power to see things but this will I do.
Bring a bullet, a knife, and a hatchet that the boy may look upon these
things when I speak and perhaps the truth will come (*see* plate 14).
One of these things will move though not touched and he shall be the
witness.' So the head men did as bidden and placed the objects as
directed. In the middle of the floor they spread a blanket and put the
articles upon it. Then they gathered around it and watched, and as they
watched he spoke and the bullet moved. Thus it happened. Then spoke
Ganio\`dai'io\`, 'This brings the confirmation of the rumor. Truly the
youth has murdered his father, and furthermore I say that the crime was
committed between Ga:nos' <span id="fr_62"></span>[3](#fn_62.md) and
Hanênk'gaek. <span id="fr_63"></span>[4](#fn_63.md) On the south side of a
mountain, where half way up an elm is broken, leaning over on the
downhill side to the west lies the body buried in the leaves of the top
branches. He, the father, is buried in the leaves.' So he said when he
spoke. The

chiefs and head-men appointed a delegation to see if all he had said
were true. So they went as they had been told and found the body of the
father and brought it back with them." Eniaiehuk.
