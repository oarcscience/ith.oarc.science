### SECTION 96

"Now again they took up their journey and had not traveled far when they
saw a crowd on both sides of the road. And when they came to where it
was they saw that they were at the forks of the road. One road, on the
right, was a narrow one and the tracks upon it were mostly those of
children and all were pointed in one direction. Few adults had their
tracks on this road, the road rough and wide. Now as they watched they
saw a woman approaching the forks of the road from behind them. She came
to where the road divided and as she halted before the roads a man who
stood to the left shouted, 'To this side.' (Now the road of the wicked
is owa'êtgä<sup>n</sup>, a rough road.) Then the man on the right said,
'Not so. This woman has done her whole duty. She has truly repented;'
Then answered the man on the left, 'You are wrong, for her repentance
has been of short duration and so of slight effect. But the man on the
right replied, 'Truly in her earth-life she repented and was faithful to
her promises. This is all that is required and she will walk upon the
narrow road.'

"Now one of the messengers turned to him and said, 'The woman has lived
a repented life for three days and has entered into the happy eternity.
It was not an easy matter for her to do so of herself, but we, the
messengers, have plead before the Creator and he has heard us. Three
times we assist every one who believes to continue in the faith of the
Gai'wiio\`. At this division in the great road we guide the spirits of
the earth into Tain'tciadê (heaven land). At the forks of the road the
spirits of the dead are divided. The narrow road leads to the pleasant
lands of the Creator and the wide and rough road leads to the great
lodge of the punisher.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
