### SECTION 65

"'Now another message.

"'It has been a custom when a person knows of a healing herb to ask
payment for giving it to a patient. Now we say that this is not right.
It is not right to demand compensation for treating the sick. If such is
done it adds greater afflictions to the sick one. The Creator has given
different people knowledge of different things and it is the Creator's
desire that men should employ their knowledge to help one another,
especially those who are afflicted. Now moreover the person helped out
ought only to give tobacco for an offering.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
