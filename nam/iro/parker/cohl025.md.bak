### SECTION 14

"'Now another message.

"'This is what your people do.

"'An old woman punished her children <span id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md)
unjustly. The Creator is sad because of such things and bids us tell you
that such practices must cease.' So they said.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

"'Now this is the way ordained by the Creator: Talk slowly and kindly to
children and never punish them unjustly. When a child will not obey let
the mother say, "Come to the water and I will immerse you." If after
this warning the child is still obstinate she must take it to the
water's edge and say, "Do you now obey?" and she must say so again and
if at the third time there is no obedience then the child must be thrust
in the water. But if the child cries for mercy it must have it and the
woman must not throw it into the water. If she does she does evil.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_29"></span>[33:1](cohl025.htm#fr_29.md) Handsome Lake was ever
the lover and champion of children. There are many instances in the
Gaiwiio relating to the care and rearing of children. The mode of
punishment here referred to was one of long usage. Sometimes the mother
would fill her mouth with water and blow it into the face of the little
offender, repeating until obedience was enforced. Punishment by violence
as by whipping or striking was discountenanced. The mother <span
id="page_34">p. 34</span> who was intrusted with the care of children
was accustomed to tell her children what was wrong and allow them by
experience to know that her word was to be relied upon. A boy remained
under the discipline of his mother until the age of sixteen when be was
turned over to the training of his father. If the boy was unruly and
without ambition the mother received the blame and was sometimes
punished.
