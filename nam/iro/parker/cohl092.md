### SECTION 81

"Now another message.

"Now the messengers said, 'Look you back in a vision to Cornplanter
village and the place where the creek empties into the river.' So he
looked and saw a large number of canoes gathered there. Many people were
assembled and there were barrels of strong drink at the place. The
people were making much noise. Now moreover there was a man there,
hopping from canoe to canoe and singing Dji'haya:, the song of the
evil-minded spirit. Now the words that he sang were these:

'More happy am I in my own house,  
Far more happy there than here.'

Yet the man seemed to be greatly enjoying himself.

"Then said the messengers, 'You have been observing, now what did you
see?'

He answered, 'I saw a man hopping from canoe to canoe singing the song
of the evil-minded one. He said that his house was more happy a place
than that where he was. The people about I should judge were filled with
strong drink.' So he said in answer to the messengers.

"Then answered the messengers, 'What you say is true. The man was the
punisher and his delight is to see people filled with strong drink.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
