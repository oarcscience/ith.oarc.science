<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE OPENING OR TOBACCO THROWING CEREMONY OF THE FALSE FACE COMPANY</H3>
<P>Now receive you this tobacco, you, Shagodiow&ecirc;<SUP>n</SUP>'gowa, the great false face.<BR>
Now it is that you have come to where your grandchildren are gathered.<BR>
Now you are taking the place of the great false faces who are wandering in the rocky valleys and mountains.<BR>
Now you are the ones who think much of this sacred tobacco.<BR>
Now we wish to make a request of you. So we always offer this sacred tobacco [literally, real tobacco], when we ask anything of you.<BR>
We pray that you help us with your power.<BR>
You can go over all the earth.<BR>
In the center of the earth is a great pine tree and that is the place of your resting. It is there that you rub your rattle when you come to rest.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_129"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 129</FONT></A></P>
<P>Now then this tree receives this tobacco.<BR>
We ask that you watch over us and exercise your power to protect us from anything harmful.<BR>
We hold in mind that you have ever done your duty in past times and we ask that you continue [vigilant] henceforth.<BR>
We use this tobacco when we ask favors of you for you are very fond of this tobacco.<BR>
Now your cane gets tobacco. The great pine tree to its top is your cane.<BR>
Now you, the husk faces, you get tobacco also.<BR>
You have been associated with the false faces in times past. Now you receive tobacco for you have done your duty.<BR>
So it is finished.</P>
