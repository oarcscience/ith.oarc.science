clear a fount of water. Then said the four, 'This is a place of
refreshment.' One of the four drew a bottle from his bosom, so it seemed
and it was, and dipped it in the spring. Then he said, 'You must partake
first,' and so he took it, but when he looked at it he thought it was
not enough. So he said, 'I think that this is not sufficient.' And when
he had said this the messengers looked at one another and smiled and one
said, 'Truly it is enough. If it lacks, there is still the spring and
the vessel may be refilled. So all took and drank and all the drink that
all wished was in the bottle. Then said the messengers, 'This is a place
of meeting. Now we will go on our journey.'" \[There are also said to
have been two other meeting places, Dioge:?'djaie, Grassy Place, and
Dion'dot, The Tree.\]

So they said. Eniaiehuk.
