### SECTION 67

"'Now another message.

"'Now it is said that your people must change certain customs. It has

friend or relative. <span id="fr_71"></span>[2](#fn_71) It is said that
while you are

upon the earth you do not realize the harm that this works upon the
departed.

"'Now moreover it is said that when an infant is born upon the earth
with which the parents are dissatisfied, it knows and says, "I will
return to my home above the earth.'"

"Now it is said that our grief adds to the sorrows of the dead. It is
said that it is not possible to grieve always. Ten days shall be the
time for mourning and when our friends depart we must lay grief aside.
When you, the beings of earth, lose one of your number you must bury
your grief in their grave. Some will die today and some tomorrow for the
number of our days is known in the sky-world. So hereafter do not
grieve. Now it is said that when the ten days have elapsed to prepare a
feast and the soul of the dead will return and partake of it with you.
It is said moreover that you can journey with the dead only as far as
the grave. It is said that when you follow a body to the grave you must
have prepared for that journey as if to travel afar. Put on your finest
clothing for every human creature is on its journey graveward. It is
said that the bodies of the dead have intelligence and know what
transpires about them. <span id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_72) It is true.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
