### SECTION 52

"'Now another message for your people.

"'Now when my relatives heard all this they said, 'This man must be a
clairvoyant (hênne'yo<sup>n</sup>?). <span
id="fr_53"></span>[2](#fn_53.md)"

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

"The news spread and Gaiänt'wakâ came as a messenger. <span
id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md) Now he came to Ganiodai'io\` and said,
'Why, having the assurance of powers, do you not commence now. Come
prophesy!' Now he had tobacco for an offering. Then he said, 'My
daughter is very sick.'

"Now the diviner of mysteries did not respond to his entreaty and so
Gaiänt'wakâ went out but soon came running back. This second time he had
the same request and plead more earnestly, but without avail.

"Then it was said that he would not respond to the cry of a brother and
had no hearing for the voice of a brother.

"Again Gaiänt'wakâ returned and urged his brother.

"Now the people said, 'Have we not something to say to you as well as
the messengers of the Creator?'

"Then he answered and said, 'Truly the people say that I will not
reason. Verily I am true to my words. Now I can do nothing but try but I
have not yet the permission of the messengers.'

"Now he went into a deep sleep and when he awoke he told his vision. Now
he said that O?gi'we <span id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_55.md) should be sung
for the sick woman.

"Now it is said that at that time the first song was in order but every
part of the song was silent.

"Now a rumor spread that after all it was not wrong to continue the
ceremonial dances once forbidden. So many were sick because they had not
observed the commanded method of closing the societies."

This was so when Gai'wiio\` was new. Eniaiehuk.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_53"></span>[49:2](cohl063.htm#fr_53.md) Diviners of mysteries
have always been prominent characters among the Indians. Their office
was to tell their clients the proper medicine society <span
id="page_50">p. 50</span> that would be most efficacious in curing the
sick, to discover the whereabouts of lost children or articles, to
discover what witch was working her spells, and to tell fortunes, as
well as to interpret dreams.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[50:1](cohl063.htm#fr_54.md) Cornplanter again
endeavored to get his brother into disfavor with the four messengers by
forcing him to exercise his powers prematurely. For this reason the
followers of Handsome Lake to this day regard Cornplanter as a malicious
character who ever tried to upset the Gai'wiio\`.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[50:2](cohl063.htm#fr_55.md) The death chant, a
ceremony belonging to the O?gi?weono? or Society of Chanters. See the
legend *Origin of the Death Dance*.
