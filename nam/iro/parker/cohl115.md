### SECTION 104

"Now he saw a certain nude woman coming out from a crowd and in all the
hair of her body were writhing serpents. Her cheeks were parched to the
bone where she had been wont to color them and likewise where her hair
was parted there was no flesh. Now she was greatly ashamed but she could
not cover her nakedness. So in this condition he saw her.

"Then said the four messengers, 'Saw thou that woman? In life she was
wont to give on'oityi'yênde, \[secret powders\] to men to attract them
to her. So you have seen the punishment meted out to those who do this
and do not repent.'

So they said. Eniaiehuk.
