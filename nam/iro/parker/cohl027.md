### SECTION 16

"'Now another message.

"'Tell your people that the Creator is sad because of what they are
doing.

"'Some people live together well as man and wife and family, but the man
of the family uses strong drink. Then when he comes home he lifts up his
child to fondle it and he is drunk. Now we, the messengers of the
Creator, say that this is not right for if a man filled with strong
drink touches his child he burns its blood. Tell your people to heed
this warning.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
