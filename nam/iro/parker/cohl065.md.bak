### SECTION 54

"Now I will relate another.

"There is a certain ceremony in the midwinter. <span
id="fr_57"></span>[2](#fn_57.md) It is said that it is most important to
uphold the customs of midwinter and that any one having a part should
fulfil it. It is said that to fulfil the customs they must go about the
neighborhood holding dances. It is said that the Creator has sanctioned
certain dances for thanksgiving."

"Now the messengers said that Ganio\`dai'io\` must sing <span
id="fr_58"></span>[3](#fn_58.md) early in the morning on three mornings and
give the cheer-cries of the Gai'wiio\`."

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.

White Dog, [p. 85](cohl142.htm#page_85.md).

<span id="fn_58"></span>[51:3](cohl065.htm#fr_58.md) This song is still
sung by the preacher of the Gai'wiio\`. The preacher stands at the door
of the Long House on three successive mornings of the new year's season
and greets the sunrise with his song. It is said to be a charm against
high winds and the faithful claim that Gao?, the spirit of the wind,
holds back his fury when the song floats over the settlement.
