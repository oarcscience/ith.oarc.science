### O\`GI'WE:, OÄ'NO?, CHANTERS FOR THE DEAD

The O\`gi'we: ceremony is called for by any member who dreams of the
restless spirit of some former member, relative, or friend. At the
ceremony the set of songs is sung, the large water drum beaten, and a
feast indulged in. The food is supposed to satisfy the hungry ghosts
that for some reason are "earth-bound," as spiritists might express it.
The O\`gi'we: ceremony must not be confused with the Death Feast
ceremony, which is a clan affair. The diviner of the O\`gi'we: people is
able to identify the unknown spirit which may be troubling the dreams of
a member. The sickness and ill fortune caused by evil ghosts may be
dispelled by the ceremony. The chief officer is a woman.
