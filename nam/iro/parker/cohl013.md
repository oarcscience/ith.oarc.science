### GANIODAIIO COMMANDED TO PROCLAIM THE GAIWIIO

"'And now behold! Look through the valley between two hills. Look
between the sunrise and the noon!'

"So I looked, and in the valley there was a deeper hollow from which
smoke was arising and steam as if a hot place were beneath.

Then spoke the messengers saying, 'What do. you see?'

I answered, 'I see a place in the valley from which smoke is arising and
it is also steaming as a hot place were beneath.'

"Then said the beings, 'Truly you have spoken. It is the truth. In that
place a man is buried. He lies between the two hills in the hollow in
the valley and a great message is buried with him. Once we commanded
that man to proclaim that message to the world but he refused to obey.
So now he will never rise from that spot for he refused to obey. So now
to you, therefore, we say, proclaim the message that we give you and
tell it truly before all people.'

"'Now the first thing has been finished and it remains for us to uncover
all wickedness before you.' So they said."
