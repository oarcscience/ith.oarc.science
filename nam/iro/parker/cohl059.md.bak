### SECTION 48

"Now another story.

1 "Now it was that when the people reviled me, the proclaimer of the
prophecy, the impression came to me that it would be well to depart and
go to Tonawanda. In that place I had relatives and friends and thought
that my bones might find a resting place there. Thus I thought through
the day.

"Then the messengers came to me and said 'We understand your thoughts.
We will visit you more frequently and converse with you. Wherever you go
take care not to be alone. Be cautious and move secretly.'

"Then the messengers told me that my life journey would be in three
stages and when I entered the third I would enter into the eternity of
the New World, <span id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md) the land of our
Creator. So they said." Eniaiehuk.

2 "The day was bright when I went into the planted field and alone I
wandered in the planted field and it was the time of the second hoeing.
Suddenly a damsel <span id="fr_50"></span>[2](#fn_50.md) appeared and threw
her arms about my neck and as she clasped me she spoke saying, 'When you
leave this earth for the new world above, it is our wish to follow you.'
I looked for the damsel but saw only the long leaves of corn twining
round my shoulders. And then I understood that it was the spirit of the
corn who had spoken, she the sustainer of life. So I replied, 'O spirit
of the corn, follow not me but abide still upon the earth and be strong
and be faithful to your purpose. Ever endure and do not fail the
children of women. It is not time for you to follow for Gai'wiio\` is
only in its beginning.'" Eniaiehuk.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_49"></span>[47:1](cohl059.htm#fr_49.md) The heaven described
by Ganiodai'io\` was called the New World because it had not been
previously known. The generations before had not gone there, not having
known the will of the Creator as revealed by the prophet.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[47:2](cohl059.htm#fr_50.md) See plate 13, the
Spirit of the Corn.
