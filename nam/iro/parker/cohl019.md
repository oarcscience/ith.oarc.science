### SECTION 7

"'Now another message.

"'The Creator has ordered that man and wife should rear their children
well, love them and keep them in health. This is the Creator's rule. We,
the messengers, have seen both men and women desert each other when
children come. The woman discovers that the man, her husband, loves his
child and she is very jealous and spreads evil reports of him. She does
this for an excuse before the world to leave him. Thus the messengers
say that the Creator desires men and women to cease such mischief.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
