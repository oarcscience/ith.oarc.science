### SECTION 84

"'Now, they said unto him, 'We will tarry here a while in order that you
may see.'

"Now as he watched and believed, he saw a large woman sitting there. Now
the woman was grasping frantically at all things within her reach, and
it seemed that she could not stand because of her great size. That was
what he saw.

"Then they said to him, 'What did you see?

"He answered, 'It is hard to say. I saw a woman sitting and she was
large of size and snatching at everything about her. I am of the opinion
that she can not rise.' So he answered when he spoke.

"Then the messengers answered, 'It is true. That which you saw was the
evil of stinginess. She can not stand and thus she will

remain forever. Thus it will be with those who forsake religious
teachings and think more of the things of earth than of the new world

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_78"></span>[63:1](cohl095.htm#fr_78) Those who gain great
riches and lack humility can not stand upon the sky-road nor can they
walk. The poor and meek only can travel skyward and not even the poor
unless their ways have been humble and marked with virtue. Thus it is
said, "It is better to be poor on earth and rich in the sky-world than
to have earth riches and no heaven."
