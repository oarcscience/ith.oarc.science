### SECTION 92

"So they proceeded on their journey and had not gone far when they
stopped.

"Then the messengers said, 'Watch attentively.' Then they pointed out to
him a certain spot midway between the earth and the clouds. So he
watched there. Now this is true. He saw a house suspended there and on
the veranda with a railing about it, a man walked and with him was a
penny dog (kwên'nîs dji\`'yä). Now moreover the man was rejoicing and he
was a white man.

"Then said the messengers, 'What did you see?'

"He answered, 'I saw a house suspended in the air and on the porch with
a railing about it a man was walking and with him was a penny dog. Now
moreover the man was a white man.'

"Then the messengers said, 'Truly you have seen. It is said that the man
is the first and oldest president of the United States. Now he enjoys
himself and he is the only white man so near the new world of our
Creator. Now it is said that there was once a time when the Thirteen
Fires and the King <span id="fr_80"></span>[2](#fn_80.md) were in trouble.
The Thirteen Fires were victorious and this man won the victory from the
king. Said the king, "You have overpowered me, so now I release
everything that was in my control, even these Iroquois who were my
helpers. It rests with you what shall be done with them. Let them be to
you a thing for a sacrifice." Then said the president, "I shall let them
live and go back to the places that are theirs for they are an
independent people." So it is said. Now this man did a great work. He
has ordered things that we may enjoy ourselves, as long as the sun
shines and waters run. This is the doing of our Great Creator.'" <span

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_80"></span>[66:2](cohl103.htm#fr_80.md) The word here is
feminine and should be translated queen but this would manifestly not be
in accord with truth. The error was made by Chief John jacket who wrote
out the Gai'wiio\` in Seneca in 1860, during the reign of Queen
Victoria.
