### THE SICK MAN

And now furthermore a man becomes sick. Some strong power holds him.

Now as he lies in sickness he meditates and longs that he might rise
again and walk upon the earth. So he implores the Great Ruler to give
him strength that he may walk upon this earth again. And then he thinks
how evil and loathsome he is before the Great Ruler. He thinks how he
has been evil ever since he had strength in this world and done evil
ever since he had been able to work. But notwithstanding, he asks that
he may again walk.

So now this is what he sang: O?gi'we, <span
id="fr_10"></span>[2](#fn_10) Ye'ondâ'thâ, <span
id="fr_11"></span>[3](#fn_11) and Gone'owo<sup>n</sup>. <span
id="fr_12"></span>[4](#fn_12) Now while he sings he has strong drink
with him.

Now it comes to his mind that perchance evil has arisen because of
strong drink and he resolves to use it nevermore. Now he continually
thinks of this every day and every hour. Yea, he continually thinks of
this. Then a time comes and he craves drink again for he thinks that he
can not recover his strength without it.

Now two ways he thinks: what once he did and whether he will ever
recover.
