### NE GANEOWO <span id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_100.md)

One of the four sacred ceremonies of the Seneca

The Ga:ne:'o<sup>n</sup>wo<sup>n</sup> is a ceremonial thanksgiving in
which two preachers," standing on either side of a long bench around
which a company of religious dancers have arranged themselves,
alternately intone sections of the Ga:ne:'o<sup>n</sup>wo<sup>n</sup>
ritual. At the end of

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

each section the speaker starts a chant which is taken up by the singers
who sit on the benches. A drummer keeps time by beating a water drum and
the dancers gracefully circle around the benches. The direction of this
dance, as all Iroquois dances, is counterclockwise. When the chant and
dance have continued a period deemed sufficient by the opposite speaker,
he halts the singing and dancing by the exclamation "Gwi?'yâ?!" and then
commences his intonation.

The writer had recorded the entire Ga:ne:'o<sup>n</sup>wo<sup>n</sup>
ritual, speeches and songs, on a set of phonograph records, especially
for preservation by the New York State Education Department.
Unfortunately these perished in the Capitol fire of March 29, 1911.
About 100 other ceremonial records on wax cylinders were also destroyed
at that time.
