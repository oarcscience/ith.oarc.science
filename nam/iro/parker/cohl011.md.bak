### THE DEAD MAN REVIVES

Now Tää'wônyâs is speaking. "Are you well? What think you?
(Isege<sup>n</sup>' onênt'gayei\` hênesni'goê\`)?"

Now the people notice that the man is moving his lips as if speaking but
no words come. Now this is near the noon hour. Now all are silent while
Tää'wônyâs asks again, "My uncle, are you feeling well?
(onigênt'gaiye\`)."

Then comes the answer, "Yes I believe myself well." So these are the
first words Ganio\`dai'io\` spoke ("Iwi\`' nai' o'nê't?gai'ye hê?'
nekni'goê<sup>n</sup>").

Now then he speaks again saying, "Never have I seen such wondrous
visions! Now at first I heard some one speaking. Some one spoke and
said, 'Come out awhile' and said this three times. Now since I saw no
one speaking I thought that in my sickness I myself was speaking but I
thought again and found that it was not my voice. So I called out
boldly, 'Niio?!' and arose and went out and there standing in the clear
swept space I saw three men clothed in fine clean raiment. Their cheeks
were painted red and it seemed that they had been painted the day
before. Only a few feathers were in their bonnets. All three were alike
and all seemed middle aged. Never before have I seen such handsome
commanding men and they had in one hand bows and arrows as canes. Now in
their other hands were huckleberry bushes and the berries were of every
color.

"Then said the beings, addressing me, 'He who created the world at the
beginning employed us to come to earth. Our visit now is not the only
one we have made. He commanded us saying "Go once more down upon the
earth and \[this time\] visit him who thinks of me. He is grateful for
my creations, moreover he wishes to rise from sickness and walk'\[in
health\] upon the earth. Go you and help him to recover."' Then said the
messengers, 'Take these berries and eat of every color. They will give
you strength and your people with us will help you rise.' So I took and
ate the berries. Then said the beings, 'On the morrow we will have it
that a fire will be in the bushes and a medicine steeped to give you
strength. We will appoint Odjis'kwâthê<sup>n</sup> <span
id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md) and Gayänt\`gogwûs, <span
id="fr_19"></span>[2](#fn_19.md) a man and his wife, to make the medicine.
Now they are the best of all the medicine people. Early in the morning
we will see them and at that time you will have the medicine for your
use, and before noon the unused medicine will be cast away because you
will

have recovered. Now moreover before noon many people will gather at the
council house. These people will be your relatives and will see you.
They will have gathered the early strawberries <span
id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md) and made a strawberry feast, and moreover
will have strawberry wine sweetened with sugar. Then will all drink the
juice of the berry and thank the Creator for your recovery and moreover
they severally will call upon you by your name as a relative according
as you are.'

"Now when the day came I went as appointed and all the people saw me
coming and it was as predicted."

wild strawberries are thought to be of great medicinal value and are
eagerly eaten as soon as ripe. So sacred a plant is the strawberry that
it is thought to grow along the "heaven road." A person recovering from
a severe illness says, "I almost ate strawberries."
