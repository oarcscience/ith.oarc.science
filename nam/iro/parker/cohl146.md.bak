1 Dä'nondinônnio\`' Êde:\`kwa gää'kwa\`, the Sun dance, is designed to
honor the sun.

2 This ceremony has no certain time for its celebration but may be
called by anyone, at any time, who dreams it necessary for the welfare
of the settlement.

3 The ceremony begins at noon when arrows are shot up toward the sun
while the populace shout their war cries.

4 A fire is built outside and tobacco is thrown by a priest who chants
the sun-rite.

5 Three times during this ceremony a shower of arrows are shot up to the
sun accompanied by a chorus of cries, intended to notify him that they
are addressing him.

6 Immediately afterward the Osto'wägowa is engaged in as the only
fitting dance to perform before the mighty Sun.

II

1 Dä'nondinônnio\`' Soi'ka gää'kwa\`, the Moon Dance ceremony, is

clairvoyant.

2 A thanksgiving speech is recited by a chief while he burns the tobacco
offering to the moon.

3 As the peach stone gambling game is thought especially pleasing to the
moon, the company gambles away the evening.

4 The distribution of the feast terminates the ceremony.

III

1 Wasaze, the Thunder Dance, is one designed to please the spirit of
Thunder, Hi?'no<sup>n</sup>.

made by a priest or chief and the dance immediately starts.

4 The line of dancers dance into the long house.

5 Hi?'no<sup>n</sup> is supposed to delight in war songs and these are
sung to please him.

6 Tobacco is burned and a thanksgiving speech made to
Hi?'no<sup>n</sup>, for his services in the past and he is prayed to
continue his favors.
