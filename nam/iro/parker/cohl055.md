### SECTION 44

"'Now another message for your people.

"'You have had the constant fear that the white race would exterminate
you. <span id="fr_47"></span>[2](#fn_47.md) The Creator will care for his
Oñgwe'o<sup>n</sup>we (real people).'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_47"></span>[45:2](cohl055.htm#fr_47.md) The Iroquois saw that
the white race had encircled them and were drawing the lines ever
tighter. They saw that they were in a position of great disadvantage,
living as they did in the midst of a people against whom they had fought
not only in their own wars but also as allies of the British. They saw
how all other native tribes had been swept away with the advance of the
invading race and thus no wonder they feared. Yet today (1912) they
still exist unabsorbed and as a distinct people in the midst of the
civilization of the Empire State under their own tribal laws and
recognized nominally as nations. The story of how they have preserved
themselves through three centuries of contact with an invading race that
had little love for them and whose policy like their own in ancient
times, is to absorb or exterminate, to accomplish a thing that no other
aboriginal race has done, is well worth a place in history as one of its
marvels. "Truly the Creator has cared for his red children!"
