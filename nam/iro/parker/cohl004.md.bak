## PRESENT EFFECTS OF HANDSOME LAKE'S TEACHING

There is no record of Handsome Lake's visiting Tuscarora, Oneida or St
Regis. The result is that these reservations contain only Indians who
are nominally Christian. The Oneida are virtually citizens, the
Tuscarora as capable of being so as any community of whites, and the St
Regis progressive enough not only to use all their own lands but to rent
from the whites. Their "Indianess" is largely gone. They have no Indian
customs though they are affected by Indian folk-thought and exist as
Indian communities, governing themselves and receiving annuities. Their
material culture is now largely that of the whites about them and they
are Indians only because they dwell in an Indian reservation, possess
Indian blood and speak an Iroquois dialect.

In contrast to these reservations where the Indian has become
"whitemanized" stand out the reservations of the Seneca and Onondaga. On
the latter the folk-ways and the "Indian way of thinking" struggle with
the white man's civilization for supremacy. The Indian of the old way is
arrayed against the Indian of the new way. The conservative Indian calls
his Christian brother a traitor to his race, a man ashamed of his
ancestors, a man who condones all the wrongs the white man has done his
people, and a man who is at best an imitator and a poor one. On the
other hand the Christian Indian calls his "feather wearing" (Adîstowäe')
brother, "a blind man in the wilderness," a nonprogressive, behind the
times, a man hopelessly struggling against fate, a heathen and a pagan.
Even so, the followers of Handsome Lake constitute an influential
element and the other Indians are affected by their beliefs whether they
are willing or not. As was remarked in the beginning, Handsome Lake
crystallized as a social unit the people whom he taught and those who
follow him today constitute a unit that holds itself at variance with
the social and accepted economic systems of the white communities about
them. They assert that they have a perfect right to use their own
system. They argue that the white man's teachings are not consistent
with his practice and thus only one of their schemes for deceiving them.
They assert that they wish to remain Indians and have a right to be so
and to believe their own prophet. They are largely instrumental in
conserving the systems peculiarly Indian and though they are a minority
they control a majority of the offices in the nations to which they
belong. Among the Onondaga and Tonawanda Seneca

they hold most of the offices. In connection with the Allegany and
Cattaraugus Seneca I use the word control, advisedly, since there may be
times when the majority of councilors may be of the Christian party.
Even so, the "conservative" party controls enough to maintain the system
that they deem right.

When their poverty is urged as an argument against their religion and
social system they assert that the true follower of the prophet will be
poor and suffer much in this world but that his condition in the "new
world above the sky" will be in direct contrast. They therefore esteem
poverty, lowly surroundings and sickness as a sure indication of a rich
heavenly reward and point to the better material surroundings and wealth
of their brethren of the white man's way as an evidence that the devil
has bought them.

The writer of this sketch has no complaint against the simple folk who
have long been his friends. For a greater portion of his lifetime he has
mingled with them, lived in their homes and received many honors from
them. He has attended their ceremonies, heard their instructors and
learned much of the old-time lore. Never has he been more royally
entertained than by them, never was hospitality so genuine, never was
gratitude more earnest, never were friends more sincere. There is virtue
in their hearts and a sincerity and frankness that is refreshing. If
only there were no engulfing "new way" and no modern rush, no need for
progress, there could scarcely be a better devised system than theirs.
It was almost perfectly fitted for the conditions which it was designed
to meet, but now the new way has surrounded them, everything which they
have and use in the line of material things, save a few simple maize
foods and their ceremonial paraphernalia, is the product of the white
man's hand and brain. The social and economic and moral order all about
them is the white man's, not theirs. How long can they oppose their way
to the overwhelming forces of the modem world and exist? How long will
they seek to meet these overwhelming forces with those their ancestors
devised but devised not with a knowledge of what the future would
require? My Indian friends will answer, "Of these things we know
nothing; we know only that the Great Ruler will care for us as long as
we are faithful." Asked about the clothes they wear, the houses they
live in, the long house they worship in, they reply, "All these things
may be made of the white man's material but they are outside things. Our
religion is not one of paint or feathers; it is a thing of the heart."
That is the answer; it is a thing of the heart--who can change it?
