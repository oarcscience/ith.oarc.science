"Now the punisher called out in a loud voice saying, 'My nephew, come
hither,' and the man stood before him. 'Now, nephew, play your violin as
was once your delight.' The punisher handed the man a bar of hot iron
and forced him to rub it upon his arm. So he played and the cords of his
arm were the strings of the instrument and made the music. So in great
agony he cried and screamed until he fell. <span

"Then said the four messengers, 'You have seen the punishment of the man
who failed to repent.'"
