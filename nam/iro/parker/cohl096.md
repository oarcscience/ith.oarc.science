### SECTION 85

"Now they said, 'We shall proceed.' Now the farther they went the more
brilliant the light became. They had not gone far when the four
messengers said, 'Now we will stop again. Look attentively at what you
see.'

"So he looked and saw three groups of people and each group was of a
different size. The first was large, the second small and the third
still smaller.

"Then the messengers asked him, 'What do you see?'

"He answered, 'I saw three groups, the first a large group, the second
half as large as the first and the third still smaller.' That is what he
said when he answered.

"Then they replied, 'Truly you have seen. The groups represent the
people of earth. The first group you saw was composed of those who have
not repented; the second group was inclined half way, and the third
group, the smallest one, was composed of those who have repented. They
are protected by the true belief in Gai'wiio\`.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
