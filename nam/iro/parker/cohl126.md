### SECTION 115

"So they took up their journey again and in a short time came to a halt.
In the distance before them a man appeared to be coming and soon he came
nearer. Then he saw that the man was guiding two others, one on either
side of him. Now as he looked he saw that one was the daughter of
Gaiänt'wakâ and it appeared that she was a large child. With her was his
(Ganio\`dai'io\`) own son, an infant, and they greeted one another, the
son and the daughter. Now one could see that they were not strangers for
they were friendly. Now moreover a fourth person was leading them all."
Eniaiehuk.
