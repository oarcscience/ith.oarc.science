<P>"'Now another word. It is sad. It is the fourth word. It is the way Yondwi'nias swa'yas.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></P>
<P>Now the Creator ordained that women should bear children.</P>
<P>Now a certain young married woman had children and suffered much. Now she is with child again and her mother wishing to prevent further sufferings designs to administer a medicine to cut off the child and to prevent forever other children from coming.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> So the mother makes the medicine and gives it. Now when she does this she forever cuts away her daughter's string of children. Now it is because of such things that the Creator is sad. He created life to live and he wishes such evils to cease. He wishes those who employ such medicines to cease such practices forevermore. Now they must stop when they hear this message. Go and tell your people.'"</P>
<P>So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_27"></A><A HREF="cohl017.htm#fr_27">30:2</A> Meaning "she cuts it off by abortion."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_28"></A><A HREF="cohl017.htm#fr_28">30:3</A> The Iroquois knew of such an herb. I find it mentioned by Dr Peter Wilson, the Cayuga, and it was pointed out to me at Onondaga in 1911. The Seneca and Onondaga belief is that every woman has a certain number of children predestined to them and that they are fastened on a stringlike runner like tubers, or like eggs within a bird.</P>
