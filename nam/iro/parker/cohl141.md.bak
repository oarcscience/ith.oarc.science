"Now shortly after he said a few words. To the numbers gathered about
him to hear his message he said, "I will soon go to

my new home. <span id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_96.md) Soon I will step into
the new world for there is a plain pathway before me leading there.
Whoever follows my teachings will follow in my footsteps and I will look
back upon him with outstretched arms inviting him into the new world of
our Creator. Alas, I fear that a pall of smoke will obscure the eyes of
many from the truth of Gai'wiio\` but I pray that when I am gone that
all may do what I have taught.'

"This is what he said. This is what Ganio\`dai'io\`, our head man, said
to his people." Eniaiehuk.

\[Then the preacher says:\] "Relatives and friends: His term of ministry
was sixteen years. So preached our head man, Ganio\`dai'io\`.

"Let this be our thanks to you and to the four messengers also. I give
thanks to them for they are the messengers of our Creator. So, also, I
give thanks to him whom we call Sêdwa:gowa:nê, our great teacher. So,
also, I give thanks to our great Creator.

So have I said, I, Sosondowa (Great Night), the preacher."

\[*Signed*\] EDWARD CORNPLANTER,

Sosondowa
