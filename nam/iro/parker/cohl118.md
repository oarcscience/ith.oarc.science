### SECTION 107

"Now they showed him another:

"Now the punisher called out a certain woman's name saying, 'Come to me,
my niece,' and straightway she came. Then said he, 'It was once your
delight gaknowe'haat.' As he said this he lifted up an object from a
pile and thrust it within her. Now the object was like ha?ji'no?
gânää?', and it was red hot. Then she cried aloud in agony and she fell
with steam issuing from her body. Now there were three piles of gâ'nää?,
the first white, the second red and the third black and all were
gâ'nää?.' So this was what he saw.

"Then the messengers said, 'You have seen the punishment of the immoral
woman.'"

So they said. Eniaiehuk.
