## THE WHITE DOG SACRIFICE <span id="fr_99"></span>[1](#fn_99)

A preliminary translation of the ceremonial prayer at the burning of the
white dog at the Seneca Indian new year's ceremony (February).

Wotokwaiiendakwa Gaiantguntgwaa

(wotok'waiîen'dakwa gaiäñt'guntgwa:')

Gwa! Gwa! Gwa!  
So now this is the appointed time! Oh listen, you who dwell in the sky!

Our words are straight--  
Only these can we speak unto you,  
Oh you from whom we are descended,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!  
You look down upon us and know that we are all children.  
Now we petition you as we burn this sacred tobacco!  
Now we commence our invocation,  
Now we speak of all that you have created.  
Now \[in the beginning\] you did think that men-beings should inherit
the blessings of your creations,  
For you did say, "Earth was my birthplace!  
Now we have spoken in this incense \[throws tobacco upon the flames\].  
Oh now inhale the smoke, so listen to our words.  
Now we commence, we are all that remain upon the earth.  
You behold the places that once were filled but now are empty;  
We were unable to change it for you made the law.  
Now you think that there should be two conditions of temperature upon
the earth;  
One you thought should be cold and one should be warm  
And when the warm season came that Diohe\`'ko, our substance, should
spring from the bosom of Earth, our mother.  
Now we have harvested the Diohe\`'ko from whence our living is  
For the warm season has gone and we have here assembled.  
Now we have made inquiries among all the people and they remember their
promises,  
For they promised you that they should assemble again at Gaiwanos'kwa
gowa'  
On the fifth sun of the moon Nîskowûk'nî.  
So all fulfilled the plan and gathered together in the moon Nîs'a, even
those here present,  
Oh you who were born of Earth, yet dwell in the sky!  
Now all have fulfilled the law, for you did plan that the rites should
be perpetuated even forever.  
Now we are commencing, Oh you who were born of Earth!  
Upon the first day the Great Feather dance went through the village for
your pleasure.  
The honon'diont and their cousins did their full duty.  
Now on the next day Gane:o\` was celebrated; at midday they went through
the village,

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

And you did give us great joy because we performed this ceremony.  
For you did think that Gane:o' should be celebrated upon the earth for
thine own self.  
Thus did we fulfil your desires, Oh you who were born of Earth, yet live
in the sky!  
Now on the next day Gagandot was played.  
Truly we did fulfil your desires,  
Oh you who were born of Earth, you who live in the sky!  
You did see all that was done,  
Oh you who were born of Earth, you who live in the sky!  
In the beginning you thought that you would lay this sacred tobacco by
man's side  
That men should have an incense with which to send his words up to the
sky,  
With which to lift his words when the year ended.  
Truly we have fulfilled your desires and here we have that basket of
sacred tobacco,  
Oh you who were born of Earth, you who dwell in the sky!  
\[Throws tobacco on the flames.\]  
So now the smoke arises!  
Oh inhale the incense as you listen!  
For now do we commence to speak of what you have created.  
In the beginning you thought that there should be a world  
Upon which men beings should travel  
That you might say, "They are my descendants."  
Now there is a shaft that reaches up to you, Ganeowi, the sacred song of
the morning it is.  
Now of your descendants as many as remain are gathered here.  
Now you thought that there should be two sexes of men-beings,  
That one should be the male and one should be the female,  
And the function of the female should be the rearing of children.  
Truly the females are fulfilling the design of their creation  
For in their arms we see their children.  
Truly it is in progress what you planned for them.  
Now the smoke arises!  
So now inhale this sacred incense!  
Now we petition you that this thing should continue so henceforth,  
And shall continue as long as the earth endures.  
Now you thought that there should be a world  
Upon which grasses of different kinds should grow

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

And that some should be medicinal,  
And that some should yield fruits for a help to the men-beings who dwell
upon the earth.  
Thus did you think, O you who dwell in the sky!  
Now it was ordered to be so when the warm season warmed the earth  
And that it should be fulfilled them and that your descendants should
see the return of things.  
Now again the smoke arises  
And the people speak through it to you,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!  
Now we implore you that it may so occur again when the earth warms,  
That your desires may be fulfilled and that your descendants may again
see your creations.  
Now again the smoke arises  
And the people speak through it to you,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky  
Yet were born of Earth!

Now our sustenance you thought should be placed beside us,  
And that men-beings should labor for their living.  
These plans are all in progress  
All see from whence their living comes.  
Now we implore you that when the earth warms again that sustaining food
may grow.  
This we ask by the power of the incense tobacco,  
Oh inhale it and listen to us,  
Oh you, our great ancestor,  
You who dwell in the sky!

You thought that there should be veins and that there should be
fountains of water;  
Now this thought is made a fact and is occurring  
So we ask that this shall continue.  
Now again the smoke arises  
To you the father of all men-beings,  
To you who dwell in the sky!

Now you thought that there should be living creatures,  
Inhabiting the waters, useful to the people.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

Now your thoughts have happened and we implore you that it may not be
withdrawn,  
Oh you who were born of Earth,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!  
But may continue as long as earth endures.

So now another.  
You did think that there should be world  
And that bushes should grow upon it for a help to the people,  
That the bushes should yield various fruits for the benefit of
men-beings,  
Oh you who were born of Earth,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky,  
May this continue as long as earth endures!

Now again the smoke arises,  
Oh inhale the incense and continue to listen  
Oh you who were born of Earth  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!

So now another.  
Now you did think that there should be forests upon the earth  
And that they might be a help to the people.  
So now moreover you did think that there should be a certain tree  
That should yield sweet water from its trunk.  
Now that tree is the Maple and it is faithful to its design  
May this continue to be,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!

Now again the smoke arises,  
And the people pray that this may still continue when the earth becomes
warm again!  
So now this thing is done.  
Our words are as straight as we could make them.  
Only this can we do for we are all young  
Oh you who were born of Earth,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!  
So now this one thing ends.

So now another.  
You have created wild animals that roam in the forests,  
You did think that they would be a pleasure to men-beings

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

Who should remember and say, "We are his descendants."  
Now may they continue so to be,  
Oh you who were born of Earth,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!

So now another.  
The people are speaking;  
They are continuing from the commencement of creation  
Discussing those things that you didst think would be a benefit to
men-beings,  
Oh you who were born of Earth,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!

Now the birds that inhabit the air,  
Birds from the low world to the great birds,  
Birds that float above the clouds.  
All these you did think would be a benefit to mankind.  
Oh you who were born of Earth,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!  
Now we ask that this thought should be forever  
Even as long as earth endures.

Now again the smoke arises,  
Continue to listen as you inhale this incense,  
For we are discussing the things of your creation  
That you did think should be a benefit to mankind,  
Oh you who were born of Earth,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!  
Now you did think that there should be a world and that it should become
cold,  
At a recurring season become cold again.  
Now we implore thee that it should not be too great a cold  
And likewise when the earth becomes warm again,  
That the heat should be moderate and comfortable.  
Now again the smoke arises  
To you who were born of Earth,  
To you who dwell in the sky!

So now another.  
Continue to listen!  
You did think that there should be a wind  
And that it should be a help to the world.

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

Now the wind is here.  
And the people pray that it may continue to be so as long as earth
endures.

Now again the smoke arises  
To you who were born of Earth,  
To you who dwell in the sky!  
Now they came from the west. Ti'so:t we call them,  
Our great grandfathers the Thunderers;  
You did make them our relatives.  
They were placed in a high position  
That they might care for the earth  
And feed the waters that flow over the world and purify them,  
And freshen all things that grow.  
A certain season was appointed for their activity  
The season when the earth commences to become warm again.  
Now again the smoke arises,  
It lifts our words to you,  
Oh inhale the incense and continue to listen,  
Oh you who were born of Earth,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!  
Now the whole world prays that you will listen,  
May all these things continue as long as earth endures,  
Oh you who were born of Earth,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!

So now again another.  
You did think that there should be a sky  
And that within it should be something to illuminate the world,  
Ênde:'ka gää\`'kwa, our great brother, the mighty warrior, the Sun,  
And that so it should be called so.  
He has a high position that shall last as long as earth endures.  
Now again the smoke arises and so smoke tobacco as you listen,  
Oh you who were born of Earth,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!  
Now the people of all earth with one voice implore you  
That your plan may be carried out and continue as long as earth
endures,  
So do your descendants pray.

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

So now another.  
It is of Soi'ka: gää\`'kwa, our grandmother, the Moon in the sky.  
You did make her a sign for reckoning the years of children.  
Now she has fulfilled the design of her creation so far.  
Now again the smoke arises.  
Inhale the incense as you continue to listen,  
Oh you who were born of Earth,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!  
Through the smoke we pray that this may be so as long as earth
endures,  
So pray your descendants,  
Oh you who were born of Earth,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!  
So have they said,  
Oh you who were born of Earth,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!

Now you did think that there should be a sky  
And that spots should be in the sky  
For signs unto the people.  
So did you design this to be so as long as the earth endures.  
And the people implore thee that this may continue to be as long as the
earth endures.  
Now again the smoke arises,  
And through it the people speak.  
Oh inhale as you continue to listen,  
Oh you who were born of Earth,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!  
Now you did design all that which should occur in the world,  
And planned the four sacred ceremonies  
That should be perpetuated forever  
And celebrated by the people each year.  
Be celebrated by these who call themselves your descendants,  
That there should be head ones and their assistants  
To perpetuate the four ceremonies.  
Now as many men-beings as remain on earth are here,  
Gathered about this pole.  
Now then you have seen that we commenced at the new part of day.  
Now you shall know that you are invited to listen to thanking songs this
day!

\[The head chief yells Yokadi!, Gowagannie!  
The people answer wo? wo? wo?!\]

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

Now tomorrow morning you must consider yourself invited to the Great
Feather Dance!

\[Cries by the head chief Hioh, hiu, hiu, hiu!  
The People answer Io? io? io? io? io?!\]

Two parts will be celebrated, the Great Feather Dance and the Harvest
Thanksgiving.

\[Cries by the head chief; Ganio ganio ganio!  
Answers by the people Ho-ni ho-ni!\]

These two ceremonies will be in progress tomorrow,  
Oh you who were born of Earth,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky  
And the next day you are: invited to the sacred game.

\[Cries by the head chief, Ba-a?! ba-a?! ba-a?! ba-a?! ba-a?!  
Answers by the people, Hoie! hoie! hoie! hoie!\]

Now again the smoke arises  
The incense of the sacred tobacco,  
To you who were born of Earth,  
Yet dwell in the sky  
Only this can we do  
To fulfil the law.  
All the things of your creation that you have made visible to us  
We thank you for and for all the things that you have created.  
In the manner that you did think, we have thanked you,  
From low earth upward to the great sky where you are living.  
With all their strength the people thank you and you have seen it,  
Oh you who were born of Earth,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!  
So now it is done.  
Now you did think that you would appoint four messengers whose work
should be to watch over earth  
And the people that dwell in the world  
To keep them all from harm,  
For men-beings are your children.  
Now do I say, the voices of the people combine as one  
To thank you.  
We have done as best we can in giving thanks to the four messengers.  
Now again-the smoke arises,  
And we speak through its incense.  
Inhale the smoke as you do listen.  
Oh the great Handsome Lake!

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

We believe that he is happy in the place that you have prepared for
him.  
Moreover we thank him.  
Oh you who were born of Earth,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!  
Now only this can we do.  
You thought that it should be this way,  
Oh you that were born of Earth,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!  
Now we thank you, the Creator of the World.  
Here are gathered so many people as remain,  
Few head men remain.  
Only this can we do, .  
And they say how the people should act.  
Of the head men and their cousins only so many are left,  
\[But they with\] the men and the women  
The children that run and the children that creep  
As one man-being offer you thanks.  
They are your descendants,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky!  
Now you did think that we should offer you tobacco when we addressed
you.  
And we have fulfilled your request and used tobacco.  
We leave our words with you until the next great thanksgiving,  
Until then may the people continue in health.  
Now the smoke arises!  
Oh inhale as you do listen!  
Only this can we do  
For all the words are spoken  
To you, our great ancestor,  
Oh you who dwell in the sky.  
Oh you who were born of Earth!
