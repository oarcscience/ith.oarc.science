### SECTION 60

"'Now another message.

"'It is a custom for thanksgiving to be made over the hills of planted
corn. <span id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_66) Let the head one of the family
make an invocation over the planted hills that the corn may continue to
support life. Now this will be a right thing and whosoever asks the help
of the Creator will receive it.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_66"></span>[54:1](cohl071.htm#fr_66) The ceremony of
invoking the Creator over the hills of corn was an old one and like many
other old customs was indorsed by the prophet. This custom is still
continued among some of the Iroquois. "When the leaf of the dogwood is
the size of a squirrel's ear, the planting season has come. Before the
dawn of the first day of the planting a virgin girl is sent to the
fields where she scatters a few grains of corn to the earth as she
invokes the assistance of the spirit of the corn for the harvest."
