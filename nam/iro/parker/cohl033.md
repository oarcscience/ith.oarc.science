"'When a woman sees an unfortunate girl who has neither parents nor
settled home and calls her in and helps her repair her clothing, cleanse
herself and comb her hair, she does right and has favor in the sight of
her Creator. He loves the poor and the woman does right before him. So
we, the messengers, say that you must tell your people to continue to do
this good thing.'"
