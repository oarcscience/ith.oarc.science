### SECTION 51

"'Now another message to tell your people.

"'The messengers have given the promise to the prophet that he will be
able to judge diseases and prescribe remedies. <span
id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md) So also he will be able to see far down
into the earth as far as runs the elm's root. Then if any trouble comes
and anyone asks the help of the prophet, he must give it freely, but
they who ask must give an offering of tobacco. Now there will be some in
your care who will be taken from your hands for other treatment. No
wrong will be done and you must bear no ill will. It is said that the
events of all our days are foreknown, so when the time comes for you to
exercise your power we will tell you and then you may judge the earth
and cure diseases.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
