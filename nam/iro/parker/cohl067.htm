<P>"This happened when Gai'wiio` was new. It was the time when he dwelt at Diono<SUP>n</SUP>?'sodeg&ecirc;`.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_60"></A><A HREF="#fn_60"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<P>"A father and son appeared in Diono<SUP>n</SUP>?'sodeg&ecirc;`. Now the name of the son was Gani'seo&ntilde;. They were on a hunting journey and came from Gad&auml;ges'k&auml;o<SUP>n</SUP>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_61"></A><A HREF="#fn_61"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> with a horse and cart. Now they tarried in Diono<SUP>n</SUP>?'sodeg&ecirc;` for several nights before again taking up their journey.</P>
<P>"It was during the hunting season that the news spread that some one had returned from the hunting grounds without a companion. It was the young man who had returned.

Then spoke Ganio`dai'io`, 'This brings the confirmation of the rumor. Truly the youth has murdered his father, and furthermore I say that the crime was committed between Ga:nos'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_62"></A><A HREF="#fn_62"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and Han&ecirc;nk'gaek.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> On the south side of a mountain, where half way up an elm is broken, leaning over on the downhill side to the west lies the body buried in the leaves of the top branches.
