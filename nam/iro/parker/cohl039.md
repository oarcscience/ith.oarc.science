### SECTION 28

"'Now another message of things not right.

"'People do wrong in the world and the Creator looks at all things.

"'A woman sees some green vegetables and they are not hers. She takes
them wrongly. Now she is yeno<sup>n</sup>'skwaswa'do<sup>n</sup>?, a
thieving woman. Tell your people that petty thieving must cease.' So
they said.

"'Now the Creator gave Diohe?'ko<sup>n</sup> <span
id="fr_33"></span>[2](#fn_33.md) for a living. When a woman sees a new crop
and wishes to eat of it in her own house, she must ask the owner for a
portion and offer payment. Then may the owner use her judgment and
accept recompense or give the request freely.'" <span
id="fr_34"></span>[3](#fn_34.md)

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_33"></span>[39:2](cohl039.htm#fr_33.md) Meaning, "our life
givers," the corn, beans and squashes. See Iroquois Uses of Maize, p.
36.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[39:3](cohl039.htm#fr_34.md) One of the old methods
of gardening was to clear a small patch in the woods by girdling the
trees and planting in the mellow forest mold. The name and totem of the
owner of the garden was painted on a post, signifying that the ground
was private property. The clan totem gave permission to any hard-pressed
clansman to take what he wished in emergency but only in such a case.
These isolated gardens in the forests were objects of temptation
sometimes, as the prophet intimates.
