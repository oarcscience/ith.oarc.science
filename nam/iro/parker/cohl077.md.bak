### SECTION 66

"'Now another message.

"'Now it is said that your fathers of old never reached the true lands
of our Creator nor did they ever enter the house of the tormentor,
Ganos'ge?. <span id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_70.md) It is said that in some
matters they did the will of the Creator and that in others they did
not. They did both good and bad and none was either good or bad. They
are therefore in a place separate and unknown to us, we think, enjoying
themselves.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_70"></span>[56:1](cohl077.htm#fr_70.md) The evil spirit has no
domain except his house. A land in which the condemned spirit might roam
would not be so terrible but eternal confinement within a house was
considered a horrible fate by the liberty-loving Iroquois.
