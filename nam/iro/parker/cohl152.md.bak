### DEWANONDIISSO<sup>n</sup>DAIK'TA\`, PYGMY SOCIETY, THE DARK DANCE CEREMONY

The ritual of this society consists of 102 songs, divided into four
sections, as follows: The first section, 15 songs; the second, 23 songs;
the third, 30 songs, and the fourth, 34 songs. The order of the ceremony
is somewhat like that of the Medicine Company. All the songs are sung in
darkness. It is believed that the spirit members of the society come and
join in the singing, and their voices are thought to be audible at
times.

The water drum and the horn rattle are used in this ceremony for keeping
time. There is a brief dance. The Dark ceremony is designed to appease
certain spirits and to procure the good offices of others. Meetings are
called at any time for the purpose of appeasing the spirits of certain
charms that have become impotent or which may become so, or are called
by members and even by nonmembers who are troubled by certain signs and
sounds, such as the drumming of the water fairies or stone throwers,
pygmies, who by their signs signify their desire for a ceremony.
Nonmembers become members by asking for the services of the society. The
rites are preeminently the religion of the "little folk" whose good will
is sought by all Indians living under the influence of the
Ongwe\`'oñwe\`ka', Indian belief. The Pygmies are thought to be "next to
the people" in importance, and to be very powerful beings. They demand
proper attention or they will inflict punishment upon those who neglect
them. This society, however, "sings for" all the "medicine charms" and
all the magic animals. These magic animals are members of the society,
and in order of their importance are: Jo<sup>n</sup>gä'o<sup>n</sup>,
Elves or Pygmies; Jodi?'gwado<sup>n</sup>, the Great Horned Serpent;
Shondowêk'owa, the Blue Panther, the herald of death; Dewûtiowa'is, the
Exploding Wren. Other members, equal in rank, are: Diatdagwût', White
Beaver; O\`nowaot'gont, or Gane?'onttwût, the Corn-bug; Otnä'yont,
Sharp-legs; O?wai'ta, Little Dry Hand; Dagwûn'noyaênt, Wind Spirit, and
Nia?\`gwahe:, Great Naked Bear.

These charm-members are called Ho'tcine'gada. The charms or parts of
these members, which the human members keep and sing for, are: none of
the first two, because they are very sacred and "use their minds" only
for charms; panther's claw; feathers; white beaver's castor; corn-bug
dried; bone of sharp-legs; dry hand; hair of the wind, and bones of
Nia?'gwahê. Some of these charms bring evil to the owners, but must not
be destroyed under any circumstance.

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

Their evil influence can be warded off only by the ceremonies. The owner
or his family appoints someone to "hold the charm" after the first
owner's death. Other charms are only for benevolent purposes, but become
angry if neglected. Of the evil charms, the sharp bone may be mentioned;
and of the good charms the exploding bird's feathers. Most of them are
regarded, however, as ot'gont. The members of this society save their
fingernail parings and throw them over cliffs for the Pygmies.

The ceremonies of the societies are always opened with a speech by the
invoker. The following speech is that of the Pygmy Society, and in a
general way is the pattern of nearly all opening invocations.

Yotdondak'o\`, Opening Ceremony of the Pygmy Society

We now commence to thank our Creator.  
Now we are thankful that we who have assembled here are well. We are
thankful to the Creator for the world and all that is upon it for our
benefit.  
We thank the Sun and the Moon.  
We thank the Creator that so far tonight we are all well.  
Now I announce that A B is to be treated.  
Now this one, C D, will throw tobacco in the fire.  
Now these will lead the singing, E and F.  
So I have said.  
\[The "tobacco thrower" advances to the fire and, Seating himself, takes
a basket of Indian tobacco and speaks as follows:\]  
Now the-smoke rises!  
Receive you this incense!  
You who run in the darkness.  
You know that this one has thought of you  
And throws this tobacco for you.  
Now you are able to cause sickness.  
Now, when first you knew that men-beings were on earth, you said,  
"They are our grandchildren."  
You promised to be one of the forces for men-beings' help,  
For thereby you would receive offerings of tobacco.  
So now you get tobacco--you, the Pygmies. \[Sprinkles tobacco on the
fire.\]  
Now is the time when you have come;  
You and the member have assembled here tonight.

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

Now again you receive tobacco--you, the Pygmies. \[Throws tobacco. \]  
You are the wanderers of the: mountains;  
You have promised to hear us whenever the drum sounds, Even as far away
as a seven days' journey.  
Now all of you receive tobacco. \[Throws tobacco.\] You well know the
members of this society,  
So let this <span id="fr_110"></span>[1](#fn_110.md) cease. You are the
cause of a person, a member, becoming ill.  
Henceforth give good fortune for she (or he) has fulfilled her duty and
given you tobacco.  
You love tobacco and we remember it; So also you should remember us. Now
the drum receives tobacco, And the rattle also.  
It is our belief that we have said all, So now we hope that you will
help us.  
Now these are the words spoken before you all, You who are gathered here
tonight.  
So now it is done.
