## CHAPTER IX.

### THE IROQUOIS POLICY.

Few popular notions, it may be affirmed, are so far from the truth as
that which makes the Iroquois a band of treacherous and ferocious
ravagers, whose career was marked everywhere by cruelty and devastation.
The clear and positive evidence of historical facts leads to a widely
different conclusion. It is not going too far to assert that among all
uncivilized races the Iroquois have shown themselves to be the most
faithful of allies, the most placable of enemies, and the most clement
of conquerors. It will be proper, in justice to them, as well as in the
interest of political and social science, to present briefly the
principles and methods which guided them in their intercourse with other
communities. Their system, as finally developed, comprised four distinct
forms of connection with other nations, all tending directly to the
establishment of universal peace.

1\. As has been already said, the primary object of the founders of
their League was the creation of a confederacy which should comprise all
the nations and tribes of men that were known to them. Experience,
however, quickly showed that this project, admirable in idea, was
impossible of execution. Distance, differences of language, and
difficulties of communication, presented obstacles which could not be
overcome. But the plan was kept in view as one of the cardinal
principles of their policy. They were always eager to receive new
members into their League. The Tuscaroras, the Nanticokes, the Tuteloes,
and a band of the Delawares, were thus successively admitted, and all of
them still retain representatives in the Council of the Canadian branch
of the confederacy.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

2\. When this complete political union could not be achieved, the
Iroquois sought to accomplish the same end, as far as possible, by a
treaty of alliance. Two notable examples will show how earnestly this
purpose was pursued, and how firmly it was maintained. When the Dutch
established their trading settlements on the Hudson River, one of their
first proceedings was to send an embassy to the Five Nations, with
proposals for a treaty. The overture was promptly accepted. A strict
alliance was formed, and was ratified in the usual manner by an exchange
of wampum belts. When the English took the place of the Dutch, the
treaty was renewed with them, and was confirmed in the same manner. The
wampum-belts then received by the Confederates are still preserved on
their Canadian Reservation, and are still brought forth and expounded by
the older chiefs to the younger generation, in their great Councils.
History records with what unbroken faith, through many changes, and
despite many provocations from their allies and many enticements from
the French rulers and missionaries, this alliance was maintained to the
last.

If it be suggested that this fidelity was strengthened by motives of
policy, the same cannot be affirmed of the alliance with the Ojibways,
which dates from a still earlier period. The annalists of the
Kanonsionni affirm that their first treaty with this wide-spread people
of the northwest was made soon after the formation of their League, and
that it was strictly maintained on both sides for more than two hundred
years. The Ojibways then occupied both shores of Lake Superior, and the
northern part of the peninsula of Michigan. The point at which they came
chiefly in contact with the adventurous Iroquois voyagers was at the
great fishing station of St. Mary's Falls, on the strait which unites
Lake Superior with Lake Huron,; and here, it is believed, the first
alliance was consummated. After more than two centuries had elapsed, the
broken bands of the defeated Hurons, fleeing from their ravaged homes on
the Georgian Bay, took refuge among the

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Ojibways, with whom they, too, had always
maintained a friendly understanding. Their presence and the story of
their sufferings naturally awakened the sympathy of their hosts. The
rapid spread of the Iroquois empire created alarm. A great agitation
ensued among the far-dispersed bands of the Ojibway name. Occasional
meetings between hunting-parties of the younger warriors of the two
peoples,--the Iroquois arrogant in the consciousness of their recent
conquests, the Ojibways sullen and suspicious,--led to bitter words, and
sometimes to actual strife. On two occasions several Ojibway warriors
were slain, under what provocation is uncertain. But the reparation
demanded by the Ojibway chiefs was promptly conceded by the Iroquois
Council. The amplest apology was made, and for every slain warrior a
pack of furs was delivered. The ancient treaty was at the same time
renewed, with every formality. Nothing could more clearly show the
anxiety of the Iroquois rulers to maintain their national faith than
this apology and reparation, so readily made by them, at the time when
their people were at the height of their power and in the full flush of
conquest. <span id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md) These efforts, however, to
preserve the ancient amity proved unavailing. Through whose fault it was
that the final outbreak occurred is a question on which the annalists of
the two parties differ. But the events just recounted, and, indeed, all
the circumstances, speak strongly in favor of the Iroquois. They had
shown their anxiety to maintain the peace, and they had nothing to gain
by war. The bleak northern home of the Ojibways offered no temptation to
the most greedy conqueror. To the Ojibways, on the other hand, the broad
expanse of western Canada, now lying deserted, and stretching

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

before them its wealth of forests full of deer, its lakes and rivers
swarming with fish, its lovely glades and fertile plains, where the corn
harvests of the Hurons and Neutrals had lately glistened, were an
allurement which they could not resist. They assumed at once the wrongs
and the territories of their exiled Huron friends, and plunged into the
long-meditated strife with their ancient allies. The contest was
desperate and destructive. Many sanguinary battles took place, and great
numbers of warriors fell on both sides. On the whole the balance
inclined against the Iroquois. In this war they were a southern people,
contending against a hardier race from the far north. They fought at a
distance from their homes, while the Ojibways, migrating in bands,
pitched their habitations in the disputed region.

Finally, both sides became weary of the strife. Old sentiments of
fellowship revived. Peace was declared, and a new treaty was made. The
territory for which they had fought was divided between them. The
southwestern portion, which had been the home of the Attiwandaronks,
remained as the hunting-ground of the Iroquois. North and east of this
section the Ojibways possessed the land. The new treaty, confirmed by
the exchange of wampum-belts and by a peculiar interlocking of the right
arms, which has ever since been the special sign of amity between the
Iroquois and the Ojibways, was understood to make them not merely allies
but brothers. As the symbol on one of the belts which is still preserved
indicates, they were to be as relatives who are so nearly akin that they
eat from the same dish. This treaty, made two centuries ago, has ever
since been religiously maintained. Its effects are felt to this day.
Less than forty years ago a band of the Ojibways, the Missisagas, forced
to relinquish their reserved lands on the River Credit, sought a refuge
with the Iroquois of the Grand River Reservation. They appealed to this
treaty, and to the evidence of the wampum-belts. Their appeal was
effectual. A large tract of valuable land

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

was granted to them by the Six Nations. Here, maintaining their distinct
tribal organization, they still reside, a living evidence of the
constancy and liberality with which the Iroquois uphold their treaty
obligations.

3\. When a neighboring people would neither join the confederacy nor
enter into a treaty of alliance with it, the almost inevitable result
would be, sooner or later, a deadly war. Among the nomadic or unsettled
Indian tribes, especially the Algonkins and Sioux, the young men are
expected to display their bravery by taking scalps; and a race of
farmers, hunters, and fishermen, like the Iroquois, would be tempting
victims. Before the confederacy was formed, some of its members,
particularly the Caniengas and Oneidas, had suffered greatly from wars
with the wilder tribes about them. The new strength derived from the
League enabled them to turn the tables upon their adversaries. But they
made a magnanimous use of their superiority. An enemy who submitted was
at once spared. When the great Delaware nation, the Lenapes, known as
the head of the Algonkin stock, yielded to the arms of the Kanonsionni,
they were allowed to retain their territory and nearly all their
property. They were simply required to acknowledge themselves the
subjects of the Iroquois, to pay a moderate tribute in wampum and furs,
and to refrain thenceforth from taking any part in war. In the
expressive Indian phrase, they were "made women." This phrase did not
even imply, according to Iroquois ideas, any serious humiliation; for
among them, as the French missionaries tell us, women had much
authority. <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md) Their special office in
war was that of peace-makers. It was deemed to be their right and duty,
when in their opinion the strife had lasted long enough, to interfere
and bring about a reconciliation. The knowledge of this fact led the
Lenapes, in aftertimes, to put forward a whimsical claim to dignity,
which was accepted by

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

their worthy but credulous historian, Heckewelder. They asserted that
while their nation was at the height of power, their ancestors were
persuaded by the insidious wiles of the Iroquois to lay aside their
arms, for the purpose of assuming the lofty position of universal
mediators and arbiters among the Indian nations. <span
id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md) That this preposterous story should have
found credence is surprising enough. A single fact suffices to disprove
it, and to show the terms on which the Delawares stood with the great
northern confederacy. Colden has preserved for us the official record of
the Council which was held in Philadelphia, in July, 1742, between the
provincial authorities and the deputies of the Six Nations, headed by
their noted orator and statesman, the great Onondaga chief, Canasatego.
The Delawares, whose claim to certain lands was to be decided, attended
the conference. The Onondaga leader, after reciting the evidence which
had been laid before him to show that these lands had been sold to the
colonists by the Delawares, and severely rebuking the latter for their
breach of faith in repudiating the bargain, continued: "But how came you
to take upon you to sell land at all? We conquered you. We made women of
you. You know you are women, and can no more sell land than women. Nor
is it fit that you should have the power of selling lands, since you
would abuse it. This very land that you now claim has been consumed by
you. You have had it in meat and drink and clothes, and now you want it
again, like children, as you are. But what makes you sell land in the
dark? Did you ever tell us that you had sold this land? Did we ever
receive any part of the price, even the value of a pipe-stem from you?
You have told us a blind story--that you sent a messenger to inform us
of the sale; but he never came among us, nor have we ever heard anything
about it. And for all these reasons we charge you to remove instantly.
We don't give you the liberty to think about it. We assign you two

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

places to go, either to Wyoming or Shamokin. You may go to either of
those places, and then we shall have you more under our eyes, and shall
see how you behave. Don't deliberate, but remove away; and take this
belt of wampum." <span id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53.md)

This imperious allocution, such as a Cinna or a Cornelius might have
delivered to a crowd of trembling and sullen Greeks, shows plainly
enough the relation in which the two communities stood to one another.
It proves also that the rule under which the conquered Delawares were
held was anything but oppressive. They seem to have been allowed almost
entire freedom, except only in making war and in disposing of their
lands without the consent of the Six Nations. In fact, the Iroquois, in
dealing with them, anticipated the very regulations which the
enlightened governments of the United States and England now enforce in
that benevolent treatment of the Indian tribes for which they justly
claim high credit. Can they refuse a like credit to their dusky
predecessors and exemplars, or deny them the praise of being, as has
been already said, the most clement of conquerors?

4\. Finally, when a tribe within what may be called "striking distance"
of the Confederacy would neither join the League, nor enter into an
alliance with its members, nor come under their protection, there
remained nothing but a chronic state of warfare, which destroyed all
sense of security and comfort. The Iroquois hunter, fisherman, or
trader, returning home after a brief absence, could never be sure that
he would not find his dwelling a heap of embers, smouldering over the
mangled remains of his wife and children. The plainest dictates of
policy taught the Confederates that the only safe method in dealing with
such persistent and unappeasable foes was to crush them utterly. Among
the most dangerous of their enemies were the Hurons and the eastern
Algonkins, sustained and encouraged by the French colonists. It is from
them and their historians chiefly that the complaints

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

of Iroquois cruelties have descended to us; but the same historians have
not omitted to inform us that the first acquaintance of the Iroquois
with these colonists was through two most wanton and butcherly assaults
which Champlain and his soldiers, in company with their Indian allies,
made upon their unoffending neighbors. No milder epithets can justly
describe these unprovoked invasions, in which the Iroquois bowmen,
defending their homes, were shot down mercilessly with firearms, by
strangers whom they had never before seen or perhaps even heard of. This
stroke of evil policy, which tarnished an illustrious name, left
far-reaching consequences, affecting the future of half a continent. Its
first result was the destruction of the Hurons, the special allies and
instigators of the colonists in their hostilities. The Attiwandaronks,
or Neutrals, with whom, till this time, the Iroquois had maintained
peaceful relations, shared the same fate; for they were the friends of
the Hurons and the French. The Eries perished in a war provoked, as the
French missionaries in their always trustworthy accounts inform us, by a
perverse freak of cruelty on their own part.

Yet, in all these destructive wars, the Iroquois never for a moment
forgot the principles which lay at the foundation of their League, and
which taught them to "strengthen their house" by converting enemies into
friends. On the instant that resistance ceased, slaughter ceased with
it. The warriors who were willing to unite their fortunes with the
Confederates were at once welcomed among them. Some were adopted into
the families of those who had lost children or brothers. Others had
lands allotted to them, on which they were allowed to live by
themselves, under their own chiefs and their native laws, until in two
or three generations, by friendly intercourse, frequent intermarriages,
and community of interests, they became gradually absorbed into the
society about them. Those who suppose that the Hurons only survive in a
few Wyandots, and that the Eries, Attiwandaronks, and Andastes

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

have utterly perished, are greatly mistaken. It is absolutely certain
that of the twelve thousand Indians who now, in the United States and
Canada, preserve the Iroquois name, the greater portion derive their
descent, in whole or in part, from those conquered nations. <span
id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md) No other Indian. community, so far as we
know' has ever pursued this policy of incorporation to anything near the
same extent, or carried it out with anything like the same humanity.
Even towards the most determined and the most savage of their foes, the
Kanonsionni, when finally victorious, showed themselves ever magnanimous
and placable.

The common opinion of the cruelty of the Iroquois has arisen mainly from
the custom which they occasionally practiced,

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

like some other Indians, of burning prisoners at the stake. Out of the
multitude of their captives, the number subjected to this torture was
really very small,--probably not nearly as large in proportion as the
number of criminals and political prisoners who, in some countries of
Europe, at about the same time, were subjected to the equally cruel
torments of the rack and the wheel. These criminals and other prisoners
were so tortured because they were regarded as the enemies of society.
The motives which actuated the Iroquois were precisely the same. As has
been before remarked, the mode in which their enemies carried on their
warfare with them was chiefly by stealthy and sudden inroads. The
prowling warrior lurked in the woods near the Iroquois village through
the day, and at night fell with hatchet and club upon his unsuspecting
victims. The Iroquois lawgivers deemed it essential for the safety of
their people that the men who were guilty of such murderous attacks
should have reason to apprehend, if caught, a direful fate.

If the comparatively few instances of these political tortures which
occurred among the Iroquois are compared with the awful list of similar
and worse inflictions which stain the annals of the most enlightened
nations of Europe and Asia, ancient and modern,--the crucifixions, the
impalements, the dreadful mutilations--lopping of hands and feet,
tearing out of eyes--the tortures of the rack and wheel, the red-hot
pincers, the burning crown, the noisome dungeon, the slow starvation,
the lingering death in the Siberian mines,--it will become evident that
these barbarians were far inferior to their civilized contemporaries in
the temper and arts of inhumanity. Even in the very method of punishment
which they adopted the Indians were outdone in Europe, and that,
strangely enough, by the two great colonizing and conquering nations,
heirs of all modern enlightenment, who came to displace them,--the
English and the Spaniards. The Iroquois never burnt women at the stake.
To put either men or

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

women to death for a difference of creed had not occurred to them. It
may justly be affirmed that in the horrors of Smithfield and the Campo
Santo, the innate barbarism of the Aryan, breaking through his thin
varnish of civilization, was found far transcending the utmost barbarism
of the Indian. <span id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55.md)

divers peoples" that, under the discipline of Iroquois institutions and
the guidance of Iroquois statesmen and commanders, held high the name of
the Kanonsionni, and made the Confederacy a great power on the continent
for more than a century after this time; who again and again measured
arms and intellects with French generals and diplomatists, and came off
at least with equal fortune; who smote their Abenaki enemies in the far
east, punished the Illinois marauders in the far west, and thrust back
the intruding Cherokees into their southern mountains; who were a wall
of defence to the English colonies, and a strong protection to the many
broken bands of Indians which from every quarter clustered round the
shadow of the "great pine tree" of Onondaga.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[98:1](ibr10.htm#fr_55.md) The Aryans of Europe are
undoubtedly superior in humanity, courage and independence, to those of
Asia. It is possible that the finer qualities which distinguish the
western branch of this stock may have been derived from admixture with
an earlier population of Europe, identical in race and character with
the aborigines of America. See Appendix, Note F.
