### ANCIENT RITES OF THE CONDOLING COUNCIL.

#### THE PRELIMINARY CEREMONY:

##### CALLED, "AT THE WOOD'S EDGE."

1\. Now <span id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62.md) to-day I have been greatly
startled by your voice coming through the forest to this opening. You
have come with troubled mind through all obstacles. You kept seeing the
places where they met on whom we depended, my offspring. How then can
your mind be at ease? You kept seeing the footmarks of our fore fathers;
and all but perceptible is the smoke where they used to smoke the pipe
together. Can then your mind be at ease when you are weeping on your
way?

2\. Great thanks now, therefore, that you have safely arrived. Now,
then, let us smoke the pipe together. Because all around are hostile
agencies which are each thinking, "I will frustrate their purpose." Here
thorny ways, and here falling trees, and here wild beasts lying in
ambush. Either by these you might have perished, my offspring, or, here
by floods you might have been destroyed, my offspring, or by the
uplifted hatchet in the dark outside the house. Every day these are
wasting us; or deadly invisible disease might have destroyed you, my
offspring.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

3\. Niyawenhkowa kady nonwa onenh skennenjy thadesarhadiyakonh. Hasekenh

Etho ne niwa ne ranyaghdenshon.

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

3\. Great thanks now, therefore, that in safety you have come through
the forest. Because lamentable would have been the consequences had you
perished by the way, and the startling word had come, "Yonder are lying
bodies, yea, and of chiefs!" And they would have thought in dismay, what
had happened, my offspring.

4\. Our forefathers made the rule, and said, "Here they are to kindle a
fire; here, at the edge of the woods, they are to condole with each
other in few words." But they have referred thither <span
id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md) all business to be duly completed, as well
as for the mutual embrace of condolence. And they said, "Thither shall
they be led by the hand, and shall be placed on the principal seat."

5\. Now, therefore, you who are our friends of the Wolf clan:

Such is the extent of the Bear clan.

These were the clans in ancient times.

9\. Thus are written the words of mutual greeting, called "the opening
ceremony." Then one will say, "My offspring, now this day we are met
together. God has appointed this day. Now, to-day, we are met together,
on account of the solemn event which has befallen you. Now into the
earth he has been conveyed to whom we have been wont to look. Yea,
therefore, in tears let us smoke together.

10\. "Now, then, we say, we wipe away the tears, so that in peace you
may look about you.

11\. "And, further, we suppose there is an obstruction in your ears.
Now, then, we remove the obstruction carefully from your hearing, so
that we trust you will easily hear the words spoken.

12\. "And also we imagine there is an obstruction in your throat. Now,
therefore, we say, we remove the obstruction, so that you may speak
freely in our mutual greetings.

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

13\. "Now again another thing, my offspring. I have spoken of the solemn
event which has befallen you. Every day you are losing your great men.
They are being borne into the earth; also the warriors, and also your
women, and also your grandchildren; so that in the midst of blood you
are sitting.

14\. "Now, therefore, we say, we wash off the blood marks from your
seat, so that it may be for a time that happily the place will be clean
where you are seated and looking around you."

15\. Now the Hymn,

CALLED "HAIL."

I come again to greet and thank the League;  
I come again to greet and thank the kindred;  
I come again to greet and thank the warriors;  
I come again to greet and thank the women.  
My forefathers,--what they established,  
My forefathers,--hearken to them!

16\. The last verse is sung yet again, while he walks to and fro in the
house, and says:

17\. "Hail, my grandsires! Now hearken while your grandchildren cry
mournfully to you,--because the Great League which you established has
grown old. We hope that they may hear.

18\. "Hail, my grandsires! You have said that sad will be the fate of
those who come in the latter times.

19\. "Oh, my grandsires! Even now I may have failed to perform this
ceremony in the order in which they were wont to perform it."

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

20\. "Na-i Raxhottahyh! Nene ji onenh wakarighwakayonne ne

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

20\. "Oh, my grandsires! Even now that has become old which you
established,--the Great League. You have it as a pillow under your heads
in the ground where you are lying,--this Great League which you
established; although you said that far away in the future the Great
League would endure."

21\. So much is to be said here, and the Hymn is to be sung again, and
then he is to go on and walk about in the house again, saying as
follows:

22\. "Hail, my grandsires! Now hear, therefore, what they did--all the
rules they decided on, which they thought would strengthen the House.
Hail, my grandsires! this they said: 'Now we have finished; we have
performed the rites; we have put on the horns.'

23\. "Now again another thing they considered, and this they said:
'Perhaps this will happen. Scarcely shall we have arrived at home when a
loss will occur again.' They said, 'This, then, shall be done. As soon
as he is dead, even then the horns shall be taken off For if invested
with horns he should be borne into the grave,' oh, my grandsires, they
said, 'we should perhaps all perish if invested with horns he is
conveyed to the grave.'

24\. "Then again another thing they determined, oh my grandsires!
'This,' they said, 'will strengthen the House.' They said, if any one
should be murdered and \[the body\] be hidden away among fallen trees by
reason of the neck being white, then you have said, this shall be done.
We will place it by the wall in the shade.

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

25\. "Onenh are oya eglidejisewayudoreghdonh, nene isewenh:

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

25\. "Now again you considered and you said: 'It is perhaps not well
that we leave this here, lest it should be seen by our grandchildren;
for they are troublesome, prying into every crevice. People will be
startled at their returning in consternation, and will ask what has
happened that this (corpse) is lying here; because they will keep on
asking until they find it out. And they will at once be disturbed in
mind, and that again will cause us trouble.'

26\. "Now again they decided, and said: 'This shall be done. We will
pull up a pine tree--a lofty tree--and will make a hole through the
earth-crust, and will drop this thing into a swift current which will
carry it out of sight, and then never will our grandchildren see it
again.'

27\. "Now again another thing they decided, and thought, this will
strengthen the House. They said: 'Now we have finished; we have
performed the rites. Perhaps presently it will happen that a loss will
occur amongst us. Then this shall be done. We will suspend a pouch upon
a pole, and will place in it some mourning wampum--some short
strings--to be taken to the place where the loss was suffered. The
bearer will enter, and will stand by the hearth, and will speak a few
words to comfort those who will be mourning; and then they will be
comforted, and will conform to the great law.'

28 Now, then, thou wert the principal of this Confederacy, Dekanawidah,
with the joint principal, his son, Odadsheghte; and then again *his*
uncle, Wathadodarho; and also again *his* son, Akahenyonh; and again
*his* uncle,

29\. Now listen, ye who established the Great League. Now it has become
old. Now there is nothing but wilderness. Ye are in your graves who
established it. Ye have taken it with you, and have placed it under you,
and there is nothing left but a desert. There ye have taken your
intellects with you. What ye established ye have taken with you. Ye have
placed under your heads what ye established--the Great League.
