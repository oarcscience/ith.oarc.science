#### NOTE B.

#### MEANING OF OHIO, ONTARIO, ONONTIO, RAWENNIIO.

The words Ohio, Ontario and Onontio (or *Yonnondio*)-which should
properly be pronounced as if written *Oheeyo*, *Ontareeyo*, and
*Ononteeyo*--are commonly rendered "Beautiful River," "Beautiful Lake,"
"Beautiful Mountain." This, doubtless, is the meaning which each of the
words conveys to an Iroquois of the present day, unless he belongs to
the Tuscarora tribe. But there can be no doubt that the termination *io*
(otherwise written *iyo*, *iio*, *eeyo*, etc.) had originally the sense,
not of "beautiful," but of "great." It is derived from the word *wiyo*
(or *wiio*) which signifies in the Seneca dialect good, but in the
Tuscarora, great. It is certain that the Tuscaroras have preserved the
primitive meaning of the word, which the Hurons and the proper Iroquois
have lost. When the French missionaries first studied the languages of
these nations, traces of the original usage were apparent. Bruyas, in
the "Proemium" to his *Radices Verborum Iroquæorum*, (p. 14), expressly
states that *jo* (*io*) in composition with verbs, "signifies
magnitude." He gives as an example, *garih8ioston*, "to make much of
anything," from garth*8*a, thing, and *io*, "great, important." The
Jesuit missionaries, in their *Relation* for 1641, (p. 22) render
*Onontio* "great mountain," and say that both Hurons and Iroquois gave
this title to the Governor of that day as a translation of his name,
Montmagny.

Ontario is derived from the Huron *yontare*, or *ontare*, lake
(Iroquois, *oniatare*), with this termination. It was not by any means
the most beautiful of the lakes which they knew; but in the early times,
when the Hurons dwelt on the north and east of it and the Iroquois on
the south, it was to both of them emphatically "the great lake."

Ohio, in like manner, is derived, as M. Cuoq in the valuable notes to
his Lexicon (p. 159) informs us, from the obsolete *ohia*, river, now
only used in the compound form *ohionha*. *Ohia*, coalescing with this
ancient affix, would become *ohiio*, or *ohiyo*, with the signification
of "great river," or, as the historian Cusick renders it, "principal
stream."

M. Cuoq, in his "*Etudes Philologiques*" (p. 14) has well explained the
interesting word *Rawenniio*, used in various dialectical

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

forms by both Hurons and Iroquois, as the name of the deity. It
signifies, as he informs us, "he is master," or, used as a noun, "he who
is master." This, of course, is the modern acceptation; but we can
gather from the ancient Huron grammar, translated by Mr. Wilkie,
(*ante*, p. 101) that the word had once, as might be supposed, a larger
meaning. The phrase," it is the great master," in that grammar (p. 108)
is rendered ondaieaat *etharontio* or *etha8endio*. The Huron *nd*
becomes in Iroquois *nn*. Etha*8*endio is undoubtedly a form of the same
word which appears in the Iroquois *Rawenniio*. We thus learn that the
latter word meant originally not merely "the master," but "the great
master." Its root is probably to be found in the Iroquois *kawen*, or
*gawen* (Bruyas, p. 64), which signifies "to belong to any one," and
yields, in. combination with *oyata*, person, the derivatives
*gaiatawen*, to have for subject, and *gaiatawenston*, to subject any
one.
