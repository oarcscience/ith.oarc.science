# CANIENGA GLOSSARY.

The following Glossary comprises all the words of the Canienga text. The
meanings of these words are given as they were received from the
interpreters. For most of them these definitions are confirmed by the
dictionaries of Bruyas and Cuoq. Some of the words, which are either
archaic forms or peculiar to the Council ceremonies, are not found in
those dictionaries; and in a few instances the precise purport of these
words must be considered doubtful. In some cases, also, the force of a
grammatical inflection or of an affix may not have been correctly
ascertained; but it is believed that the vocabulary will be found, in
general, sufficiently accurate to be of service to the student who may
desire to acquire some knowledge of the Canienga speech.

When the words of John Buck's copy differ in orthography from those of
the Johnson MS., the former are added in brackets. Words cited from the
dictionary of Bruyas are distinguished by the letter B; those from the
lexicon of M. Cuoq by C.
