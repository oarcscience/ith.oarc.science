# PREFACE.

The aboriginal composition now presented to the public has some peculiar
claims on the attention of scholars. As a record, if we accept the
chronology of its custodians,---which there is no reason to
question,---it carries back the authentic history of Northern America to
a date anterior by fifty years to the arrival of Columbus. Further than
this, the plain and credible tradition of the Iroquois, confirmed by
much other evidence, links them with the still earlier Alligewi, or
"Moundbuilders," as conquerors with the conquered. Thus the annals of
this portion of the continent need no longer begin with the landing of
the first colonists, but can go back, like those of Mexico, Yucatan and
Peru, to a storied past of singular interest.

The chief value of the Book of Rites, however, is ethnological, and is
found in the light which it casts on the political and social life, as
well as on the character and capacity, of the people to whom it belongs.
We see in them many of the traits which Tacitus discerned in our
ancestors of the German forests, along with some qualities of a higher
cast than any that he has delineated. The love of peace, the sentiment
of human brotherhood, the strong social and domestic affections, the
respect for law, and the reverence for ancestral greatness, which are
apparent in this Indian record and in the historical events which
illustrate it, will strike most readers as new and unexpected
developments.

The circumstances attending the composition of this record and its
recent discovery are fully detailed in the introductory chapters. There
also, and in the Notes and Appendix, such further explanations are given
as the various allusions and occasional obscurities of the Indian work
have seemed to require. It is proper to state that the particulars
comprised in the following pages respecting the traditions, the usages,
and the language of the Iroquois (except such as are expressly stated to
have been derived from books), have been gathered by the writer in the
course of many visits made, during several years past; to their
Reservations in Canada and New York. As a matter of justice, and also as
an evidence of the authenticity of these particulars, the names of the
informants to whom he has been principally indebted are given in the
proper places, with suitable acknowledgment of the assistance received
from each. He ventures to hope that in the information thus obtained, as
well as in the Book of Rites itself, the students of history and of the
science of man will find some new material of permanent interest and
value.
