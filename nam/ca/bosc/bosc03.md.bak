### Of What Race of People Are These Indians?

To commence this relation, it may be proper, in the first place, to
search after the origin, or lineage of these Indians of New California.
But it is impossible to find any account of where they originated; as
those of this mission, (St. Juan Capistrano) and indeed those of all the
missions in the province, have no tradition, and are entirely ignorant
of their descent. Without examining into the opinion of others, as to
their being descendants of the Jews, Carthagenians or Phœnicians, I
shall confine myself to the class that came to populate the Mexican
Territory, and from these have doubtless descended the natives of
California.

The tribes that populated the Mexican Territory at different epochs,
according to the writings of Father Torquemada in his "Monarquia
Indiana," were four; and as follows: "Tulticas," "Chichimecas,"
"Aculnas," and "Mexicanos." Of these distinct tribes, my opinion is,
that the race of California proceeded from the Chichimecas, because,
from the Tulticas they could not have originated, as is manifest from
their characters, and inclinations; for "Tultica" signifies Art, and
these Indians do not manifest the least industry or ingenuity. They are,
in every respect, like the Chichimecas, according to the description
given of them by Father Torquemada. "Near the northern boundary of
Mexico there was a province, the principal city of which was called
Amaqueme; its inhabitants, Chichimecas, were people entirely naked,
fierce in appearance,

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

and great warriors. Their arms the bow and arrows; their ordinary
sustenance game and wild fruits, and their habitations were caves, or
huts made of straw. As it was their manner of life habitually to roam
about among the mountains, in search of game, they paid but little or no
attention to the art of building." This is the picture given by Father
Torquemada of the Chichimecas, and comparing them with the natives of
California, they are found the same in every respect.

Although the habitations of the said Chichimecas formed a kind of
village, still they had no police, nor acknowledged any higher power
than that of "Capitan" or chief, and toward him was observed but little
respect; indeed, hardly sufficient to designate him from the rest. They
did not live permanently in one place, but roamed about, from spot to
spot, as the scarcity of game compelled them. Of medicine they had no
knowledge; consequently, no means of curing the sick, and the bodies of
their dead were immediately burnt. Idolatry prevailed among them, but
not a belief in a plurality of gods; neither did they sacrifice, as
[was](errata.htm#0.md) the custom among the Mexican Indians.

Having thus described the Chichimecas, we see precisely the character of
the Californians, with the exception, that the last mentioned lived in
villages, and were governed by a chief, whom they entitled "Not,"
signifying lord, or master; he possessed but little influence over his
subjects, and they in return entertained no respect for his authority,
as we shall see hereafter. The name, *Chichimeca*, signifies a "sucker."
Their principal sustenance was the flesh of animals taken in hunting
excursions, and which was generally consumed in a raw state, after
sucking all the blood; and from this, arose the term Chichimeca.

The Californian, often made his repast from the uncooked animal, and at
the present day, flesh, very slightly cooked, is quite common among
them. They also extract the blood in like manner, and I have seen many
instances of their taking a rabbit, and sucking its blood with
eagerness, previous to consuming the flesh in a crude state. The
diversities of language, and other pecularities, render it extremely
difficult to ascertain to a certainty, if all the inhabitants of Alta
California descended from the Chichimecas. Those between Monterey and
the extreme northern boundary of the Mexican domain, shave their heads
close; while those to the south, between Santa Barbara and towards St.

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Lucas, wear their hair long, and take pride in
cultivating its length as a mark of beauty. Those between Santa Barbara
and Monterey, differ considerably from these, as regards their habits;
being much more industrious, and appear an entirely distinct race. They
formed, from shells, a kind of money, which passed current among them,
and they constructed, out of logs, very swift and excellent canoes for
fishing. Their dead, they interred in places appropriated to that
purpose. The diversity of language is so great, in California, that
almost every 15 or 20 leagues, you find a distinct dialect; so
different, that in no way does one resemble the other. It is natural to
suppose, that the Chichimeca nation, would have had but one language,
notwithstanding, it might have varied a little, from one place to
another, as is seen in other parts of the world, where are to be met
with certain provincialisms, which are not to be found in the original
tongue. But here, it is not so; for the natives of St. Diego cannot
understand a word of the language used in this mission, and in like
manner, those in the neighborhood of St. Barbara, and farther north. If
it should be suggested, that people thus separated, could have corrupted
the original language, in all its phraseology, and manner of
pronunciation, I would reply, that such *might* be the case; but still,
there would be some connection, or similarity, so that they could
understand each other. This has placed me somewhat in perplexity; and I
am without means of discovering the cause of such dissimilarity in a
spot, confined like California; and I shall leave the subject to some of
my brother missionaries, or to those who may peruse these writings, to
explain.
