# Chapter XIII

### Their Funeral Ceremonies

Before treating upon the subject of their manner of interment, I will
just refer to the remedies used for their diseases. They possessed some
knowledge of the virtues of certain medicinal herbs, and the external
application of them to cutaneous disorders; but for internal diseases,
such as fevers, &c., they always resorted to cold baths. For pains in
the head, immediate application of cold water was the remedy. For
external diseases, such as tumors, swellings, sores and rheumatic pains,
they made use of various herbs, known to us, and called sage, rosemary,
and nettle-plant--which were applied in a plaster. They made use of a
kind of black rosin also, which was very oily, and manufactured from
certain seeds. When attacked with pain in the stomach they inhaled the
smoke of these plants, and if afflicted with any ordinary pain, a
whipping, with nettles, was applied to the part affected, and frequently
large ants.

For disease of the liver, fevers, and all malignant complaints, I have
not discovered that they made use of any remedies but the cold water
baths, before mentioned. Sometimes the patient, entirely exposed, was
laid upon a quantity of dry ashes or sand, and at his feet blazed a
scorching fire, without regard to the season. At his head stood a small
vessel of water, and sometimes gruel, that he might partake of them, if
he chose, but no persuasions were ever used on the part of his friends
to induce him to do so, if he did not feel inclined. He was never left
alone, being

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

attended by many of his friends, both day and night; and thus he
remained until either nature, or the disease, conquered.

As soon as any one fell ill, they immediately sent for the physician,
who was one of the *puplem*, or soothsayers before spoken of. It must be
understood that not all of the *puplem* possessed the necessary
qualifications, but only those who received them by succession. When
they appeared before the patient, it was always with an air of great
mystery. A strict examination into the state of the patient, was the
commencement of their performances, and divers infirmities were
explained, and their causes--all originating from the introduction of
certain particles into the body of the patient, such as the hairs of
various animals, bones, stones, briers, sticks, &c., which produced the
pain or infirmity. Before prescribing anything, they made use of many
superstitious ceremonies. In the first place, the patient was examined
from head to foot, and no part of his body remained untouched. Then the
painful parts became the topic of discussion, and were represented as
having within them something of a hard substance, such as a stone,
splinter, or bone, and of course, their success in removing the disease
was ever a matter of great uncertainty; but still, they would use all
their skill, and endeavor to restore him to health. They placed feathers
upon his head, and encircled him entirely with these, and other
articles, such as horse-hair, grass, beads, and hairs of the head;
blowing at the same time with their mouths towards the four cardinal
points, and muttering to themselves certain low sounds--certain
mysterious words--accompanied with antic gesticulations, of which no one
knew the meaning. After this, one of them applied his lips to the part
affected, and pretended to draw from it, by suction, the particles,
which they had stated as being within, and exposed them to all present.
The spectators, as well as the patient, placed strict confidence in the
fact, and were satisfied, whether he recovered or died. When the patient
did not recover from his disease, the puplem would say, it was because
Chinigchinich had sent him the infirmity, as a chastisement for some act
of disobedience, and that he must reconcile himself to death.

There were many of these impostors spread about the country, who, after
being well fed and paid for their *services*, made all manner of
ridicule of their too credulous companions. Wonderful as it may appear,

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

oftentimes they performed cures, when the patients were apparently fast
verging into eternity, and in the space of twenty-four hours, by their
extravagances and witchcraft, they have enabled them to rise from a bed
of sickness, and unite with their companions in their domestic
employments. I will relate a case which happened in the mission of "La
Purissima," A.D. 1809, which will serve to confirm the truth of the
preceding statement. A young woman of eighteen years of age, had been
sick for nearly a year, suffering from the effects of dysentery and
fever, so that she had wasted away almost to a skeleton, and was to all
appearances dying; having received the holy sacrament preparatory to her
supposed departure. One morning, whilst walking in the garden of the
mission, I saw her sitting with other females performing the task of
clearing the grass; surprised at beholding her there, when I supposed
her dying, I asked her how she felt? Her mother, who was at her side,
replied to the question, and said that she was well, because such a one
(naming one of the sorcerers) had taken from her some bear's hairs,
which were the cause of her illness, and, immediately, she was restored.
I inquired how they were introduced into her stomach, and how long she
had had them? She replied, that when in childhood, and about eight or
nine years old, one night, whilst asleep with other children in a room
by themselves, a bear came and placed some of his hairs on her stomach.
How he came there, or how the hairs got into her stomach, she could not
explain; for all that she knew about it, had been stated to her by the
sorcerer. This was all deception, of course, but still it happened from
that day, that the girl improved in health, and, in a short time, was as
robust and hearty as any one!

When the patient died under the attendance of these physicians, then
preparations were made for his sepulture, or the burning of his body,
according to a custom observed here, in commemoration of the last
ceremonies rendered to the remains of their grand chieftain *Ouiot*.
They did not put into immediate execution the solemn duties and funeral
performances, but suffered several hours to elapse, that they might be
assured of his death. In the meantime the pile was prepared, and the
person summoned, who officiated on such occasions in applying the torch;
for it was usual, in this neighborhood, to employ certain characters,
who made their livelihood by it, and who, generally, were confined

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

to particular families. As soon as every thing was prepared, and the
time had arrived for the ceremony, they bore the corpse to the place of
sacrifice, where it was laid upon the faggots. Then the friends of the
deceased retired, and the burner (so called) set fire to the pile, and
remained near the spot until all was consumed to ashes. The ceremony
being concluded on his part, he was paid for his services, and withdrew.
Every thing of use, belonging to the deceased, such as his bow and
arrows, feathers, be-ads, skins, &c., were consumed with him, whilst his
relatives and friends added, also, other articles of value to the
sacrifice, but during the scene of burning they did not observe any
particular ceremony, nor had they any; for as soon as the burner gave
notice that he had performed his task, they all retired outside of the
town to mourn the decease of their friend. The *puplem* sang songs,
while the relatives wept; and the substance of their canticles was
merely a relation of the cause of the infirmity--the location of the
disease--when it first commenced, and its course throughout the body,
until it attacked the heart, when he died, thus naming over all the
parts of the human frame. These songs were generally repeated over and
over for three days and nights, and then they returned to their homes.

The mode of testifying their grief by outward appearance, was by
shortening the hair of their heads; and in conformity to the kin of the
deceased, so they regulated the custom. For the loss of a parent, wife
or child, the head was completely shorn; for a distant relative, they
cut off merely one half of the length, and for a friend, only the
extremity; but in all cases, however, they were governed entirely by the
love and attachment for the deceased. The same custom is now in use, and
not only applied to deaths, but to their disappointments and adversities
in life, thus making public demonstration of their sorrow.
