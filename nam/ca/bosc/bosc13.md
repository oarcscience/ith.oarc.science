# Chapter XI

### Their Calendar

We cannot but believe that the calendar is one of the most important and
the most necessary of inventions. But theirs, if we may call it such,
differed but very little from the natural instinct of the brute
creation, which possessed a knowledge of time, and the seasons for their
sustenance and procreation. We see that many animals change their
places, and even climates, at a time prefixed; either on account of the
temperature or want of food; and at the proper time for their return
they visit again the same locations. The Indians had the same custom, as
regards the changing from place to place; for in the winter they resided
in one place, and in summer in another. This was general amongst them,
excepting with those located on the sea-coast, who seldom removed,
because their maintenance was derived from the sea; unlike the others
who subsisted entirely upon fruits and seeds of the fields. Their
calendar contained merely the names of the months, directing the times
or seasons for the collecting of their different seeds, and produce of
the earth. Not all of them possessed this knowledge; it being confined
to the *Puplem* who were the criers that informed them when to cultivate
their fields, and observe other requisitions. In the first place, they
were destitute of chronology, by which to calculate the period of time
transpired; hence, the difficulty in giving any account of their
antiquities, as they had neither figures nor signs to preserve them; and
possessing no idea of the past, their thoughts were limited solely to

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

the present. On this account their calendar was confined to the months
of the year, but as they reckoned these by the number of moons, they
differed from the "sun's reckoning," having almost every year a less
number of days--for at the conclusion of the moon in December, that is,
at the conjunction, they calculated the return of the sun from the
Tropic of Capricorn; and another year commenced, the Indian saying "the
sun has arrived at his home." When the new year begun, no thought was
given to the past; and on this account, even amongst the most
intelligent, they could not tell the number of years which had
transpired, when desirous of giving an idea of any remote event.

They observed with greater attention and celebrated with more pomp, the
sun's arrival at the tropic of Capricorn, than they did his reaching the
tropic of Cancer, for the reason, that, as they were situated ten
degrees from the latter, they were pleased at the sun's approach towards
them; for it returned to ripen their fruits and seeds, to give warmth to
the atmosphere, and enliven again the fields with beauty and increase.

The names of the months were as follows:--

|              |                       |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| Aapcomil,    | December and January. |
| Peret,       | February.             |
| Yarmar,      | March.                |
| Alasoguil,   | April.                |
| Tocoboaich,  | May.                  |
| Sintecar,    | June and July.        |
| Cucuat,      | August.               |
| Lalavaich,   | September.            |
| Aguitscomel, | October.              |
| Aaguit,      | November.             |

 

In order to comprehend the manner in which they counted the months, it
is necessary to know that their year commenced always on the 21st day of
December, and upon the sun's arrival at the tropic--consequently, the
days which transpired between the last conjunction and the 21st were not
noticed--or, in their mode of explanation, "There was no day." The month
"Aapcomil" always begun on the 21st, without any regard to the moon's
age, and not only continued during the remainder

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

of its term, but throughout the one following; thus including nearly two
moons. Sometimes it so happened that the moon's conjunction occurred on
the 21st or afterwards, in which case two entire moons were counted in
the first month. Nearly the same occurrence took place in "Sintecar,"
with this difference only, that if the sun's arrival at the tropic of
Cancer fell upon the day of the moon's full, then the month began; but
the days previous to this were made use of, and annexed to the
antecedent "Tocoboaich,"--that is, the month did not expire with the
conjunction, but at the full; when the other began, and continued
throughout the following moon. All the other months of the year
commenced with the conjunction, therefore, they seldom agreed with ours.

Their calendar contained no more; and served, principally, to denote
when to harvest the grain, celebrate their feasts, and commemorate the
death of their friends. But of the number of days contained in their
months, they had no knowledge whatever, and much less of those composing
the year-so that the phases of the moon were their only guide, and these
informed them when they were to observe their feastings, which never
fell upon the same day in any other year. The way they ascertained when
to celebrate them, was as follows. When the month arrived, one of the
Puplem (to whom belonged the privilege of holding the feast) observed
with attention the moon's aspect; and when its appearance denoted the
time, he made known the fact to the public by sending a crier through
the town.

In like manner, they proceeded, in regard to the anniversaries of the
dead, although they were never celebrated on the same day in any other
year, as that on which the person died. At the time of the decease of a
captain, or of one of the Puplem, (for they paid no attention to others)
a *Pul* observed the moon's aspect, also the month in which the death
occurred; and in the following year, in the same month, when the moon's
aspect was the same, they celebrated the anniversary.
