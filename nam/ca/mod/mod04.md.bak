### THE IMPIETY OF THE FROG.

When the moon had grown very little all the people were over there
running races; and after all had finished running, the rabbit and the
frog ran together; and all the people stood around looking on and
laughing at the frog, because he had the shape of a man, but wore no
clothes. Then the frog was very angry at the Maker, and the thought
entered his head, "Because you did not make me well, you shall pay for
it."

Tu-chai-pai had gone away to a very high place, and he was asleep up
there, and the frog was down in a deep place holding up his hands in
defiance of the Maker. Then came the sunshine, and Tu-chai-pai with it.
He had a long stick, pointed at both ends, and he held it up over his
head. And he took the stick and felt in the deep place with it, and it
touched the back of the frog, where it made a long white mark. By that
time the frog had planned a wrong deed. He meant to exude poison,
swallow it, and die. When thoughts of this evil entered the heart of
Tu-chai-pai, he said to himself, "I shall die." Then some boys came and
told him what the frog had done.

Tu-chai-pai said, "I shall die with the moon. Go, look at the moon,
Ach-hulch-la-tai. Look again, Hup-lach-sen. Look at it a third time,
Hucht-la-kutl. <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) Then I will die."

"Oh, it is a bad time." They looked at the moon, and they watched it to
see when Tu-chai-pai would die. It was very little, and they watched it
grow smaller, and in six months he finished his life. And all the things
on this earth are the children of Tu-chai-pai, and they will die, too.
