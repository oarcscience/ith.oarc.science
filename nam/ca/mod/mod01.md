# The Mythology of the Diegueños

## by Constance Goddard Du Bois

THE Diegueños have been classified as belonging to the Yuman family of
Turner and Brinton. They make part of the Mission Indians of San Diego
County, California, in which are also included fragments of Shoshonean
tribes, akin to the Nahuatlan peoples of Southern Mexico. It would not
be surprising to find in the folklore of the Shoshonean tribes traces of
Aztec influence; but if the Diegueños belong to another family, a rather
curious problem is presented by the following relics of tribal mythology
related to me by old Cinon Duro, the last chief of the Diegueños, since
they seem to suggest by internal evidence relations with primitive Aztec
tradition.
