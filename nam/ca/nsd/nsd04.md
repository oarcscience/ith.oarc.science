### AGUA CALIENTE.

The previously published Agua Caliente vocabulary was gone over with
Jose Miguel of the Reservation at Banning, who learned from his mother
this dialect intermediate between Luiseño and Cahuilla. Only such words
are here presented as he gave in a more or less new form. The
differences consist in part of the presence and absence of final a. It
appears from the preceding

discussion of the Cahuilla dialect that this ending is a subjective case
suffix, and not part of the word itself. Other discrepancies between the
two lists are due to the occurrence of certain nouns in one list with
the possessive prefix, which causes the loss of their ending. Such are:
no-gotapi, gutapi-c; no-hu-ya, hu-l; ne-pi<span class="it">v</span>’a,
pi<span class="it">v</span>a-t.

Ten, namadulwanut; eleven, suplawat namixunut; twelve, wi namixunut;
twenty, wis namidulwanut.
