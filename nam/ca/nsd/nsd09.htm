<p>The Kern River branch, or T&uuml;batulabal dialect, can only be mentioned here. The possessive my is expressed by -n, your by -&ntilde;. This fact is of significance since of all other Shoshonean dialectic groups Ute-Chemehuevi alone suffixes the possessive pronominal elements. As T&uuml;batulabal is territorially in contact with Kawaiisu, there is the possibility that one group has influenced the other in this respect. The T&uuml;batulabal words for man, woman, and house show a curious form of reduplication to indicate the plural: datwal, adatwal; goim, ogogoim; hanil, ahanhanil. It does not follow that these cases are typical of the formation of the plural throughout the language. Most Shoshonean, and in fact most Uto-Aztekan, dialects show a certain amount of reduplication to express the plural without employing it as the regular or customary means. The word anawic-m, Pleiades, meaning girls and unquestionably plural in meaning, may contain the usual Shoshonean plural suffix -m. Compare anawic-bit, girl, in which -bit is the diminutive; and anabic, sweet. The name which the T&uuml;batulabal apply to the Kawaiisu, Kawishm, and perhaps their designation of the Bankalachi, Toloim,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A> seem also to contain the plural suffix.</p>  
<p>A comparison of the practically equivalent T&uuml;batulabal and Bankalachi vocabularies shows several forms denoting parts of</p>

<p>the body used in one case with possessive affix and in the other without. Such are cunan, my heart, and cunal, heart; buntcil and puntsin, eye, the latter really my eye; mupit and mupin, nose. It thus appears that in this dialectic group terms denoting parts of the body are provided with noun endings when they are not used with a possessive pronoun, in which respect the Kern River branch differs from the Southern California and Ute-Chemehuevi dialectic groups.</p>
