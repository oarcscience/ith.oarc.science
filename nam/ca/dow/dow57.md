### WHAT GOOD AND BAD GHOSTS TURN INTO

*The Northern Mewuk say*:

The heart-spirits or Ghosts (*Soo-lek'-ko*) of good Indians turn into
*Too-koo'-le* the Great Horned Owl; those of bad Indians into
*Et-tā'-le* the Barn Owl, *Yu'-kal-loo* the Meadowlark, *O-lā'-choo* the
Coyote, or *Choo'-moo-yah* the Gray Fox. <span
id="fr_24"></span>[26](#fn_24.md) Whatever they turn into they continue to
be forever--there is no change after that.

The night after the Ghost leaves the body it may come back and do harm
to someone-so it is well to look out. \[My informant told me that the
night after his wife's Ghost left her body it came back while he was,
asleep and beat him severely.\]

NOTE. The Tribes of Midoo stock also believe in transmigration. *The
No-to'-koi-yo* or Northeastern Midoo say that their ghosts go into the
Great Horned Owl, while the *Pā'-we-nan* or Southwestern Midoo say that
when a person dies his spirit (*oos*) may go into any one of a number of
things: it may turn into an Owl or Coyote, a Snake or a Lizard; it may
become a Whirlwind, or it may

go into the ground and become earth. Sometimes, but rarely, it goes off
to a good place.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_24"></span>[219:26](dow57.htm#fr_24.md) The Coyote and Fox are
bad*--*they kill too much and make too much trouble; good Indians do not
like them. *Yu'-kal-loo* the Meadowlark is a bad bird; he is mean and is
always saying disagreeable things.
