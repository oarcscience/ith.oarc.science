# Note

HE accompanying illustrations are from paintings made expressly for the
present collection of Myths by Edwin W. Deming of New York and Charles
J. Hittell of San Francisco.

Of the stories here published, only a few are complete, and several
consist of the merest fragments. All however are of ethnologic value,
for even those expressing a single idea may prove of service in tracing
relationship. In preparing them for the press my aim has been to
reproduce them in simple English, adhering as closely as possible to the
form in which they were told me by the Indians. Certain brief passages
and repetitions have been omitted; nothing has been added.

All the Indian words, whether tribal names or names of objects, are
written in simple phonetic English. The letter *a*, when unmarked, has
the sound of *a* in fat; *a* long (*ā*) has the sound of *a* in fate;
and the *ah* sound is always spelled, *ah*.
