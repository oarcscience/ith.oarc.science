### Wek'-wek's Visit to the Underworld People

AFTER *Wek'-wek* had sent his sister home he stayed near-the caves below
*Koo-loo'-te* and dug holes in the sand and found roots and seeds that
were good to eat. In digging he came to a very deep hole which led down
under the world; he went down this hole and when he reached the
underworld found other people there, and got a wife with a little boy.
Besides his wife there were *To-to'-kon* the Sandhill Crane, *Wah'-ah*
the Heron, *Cha-poo'-kah-lah* the Blackbird, and others.

*To-to'-kon* the Sandhill Crane was chief. When he saw *Wek'-wek* he
said, "What shall we do with this man; he is lost; we had better kill
him."

*Wek'-wek* saw a man make ready with his bow and arrow, and invited him
to come and eat. The man came and ate, and when his belly was full went
back.

Captain *To-to'-kon* said, "I didn't send you to eat, but to kill him."
Then he sent another, and *Wek'-wek* asked him also to come and eat, and
he did as the other had done. Then Captain *To-to'-kon* sent two men
together to kill him, but *Wek'wek* called them both to come and eat)
and they did so. Then *To-to'-kon* was angry; he sent no more

men but went himself and took his bow and arrow. *Wek'-wek* said to him,
"Come in," whereupon *To-to'-kon* shot his arrow but missed.

Then *Wek'-wek* came out and faced the people. They fired all their
arrows but could not kill him. *Wek'-wek* said, "You can't kill me with
arrows. Have you a pot big enough to hold me?"

"Yes," they answered.

"Then set it up and put me in it," he said.

And they did as they were told and put *Wek'wek* in the hot pot and put
the cover on. When he was burned they took out the burnt bones and
buried them in the ground.

*Ah'-ut* the Crow missed his uncle and went to his uncle's partner,
*Hoo-loo'-e*, who was in the hole crying, and asked where *Wek'-wek*
was. *Hoo-loo'-e* pointed down the hole. *Ah'-ut* went down and found
the rancheria of the underworld people and killed them all. He then
asked *Wek'-wek's* wife where *Wek'-wek* was. She answered that the
people had burned and buried him.

*Wek'-wek* stayed in the ground five days and then came to life; he came
out and asked his wife where the people were. She told him that *Ah'-ut*
had come and killed them all. "That is too bad," he exclaimed, "I wanted
to show them what kind of man I am." Then he said she should stay there
and he would take the boy and go home.

She answered, "All right."

Then he shot his arrow up through the hole and

caught hold of it, and held the boy also, and the arrow carried them
both up to the upper world.
