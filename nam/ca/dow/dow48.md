### THE MEADOWLARK, A GOSSIP AND TROUBLEMAKER

*The Olayome of Putah Creek say*:

*Hoo-yu'-mah* the Meadowlark understands and speaks our language. He
often makes disagreeable remarks; we often hear him say, "I see you are
angry," and other mean things.

NOTE. In the Ancient Myths it has already been shown that the Northern
*Me'-wuk* and *Wi'-pā* tribes of Mewan stock, and the *Pā'-we-nan* tribe
of Midoo stock, hold the Meadowlark responsible for the failure of dead
people to rise on the third or fourth day and come to life again (see
pages

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
[55](dow11.htm#page_55)-56 and [132](dow25.htm#page_132).md). This belief
is widespread among the Mewan tribes and is held also by at least one
Pomo tribe-the \`Ham'-fo or Koi'-im-fo of Clear Lake.

All the Mewan tribes, and many belonging to widely different
stocks--including even the Washoo of Lake Tahoe and adjacent valleys
east of the Sierra--class the Meadowlark among the bad birds. They say
he talks too much and is a gossip and they do not like him. The Washoo
call him *Se-soo'-te'-al-le* and, like several other tribes, insist that
he talks to them in their own language and always makes uncomplimentary
remarks. He tells them that he sees right through them; that they are
stingy and provide only food enough for themselves; that they are dark
on the outside only and under the skin are as white and mean as a white
man, and so on.

*The Mariposa Mewuk say*:

If a person breaks a Meadowlark's egg it will rain.
