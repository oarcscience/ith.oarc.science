# Beliefs Concerning Animals

### BEARS RESEMBLE PEOPLE AND LIKE TO DANCE

*The Northern Mewuk say*:

Bears are like people. They stand up, they have hands, and when the hide
is off, their bodies look like the bodies of people. Bears know a great
deal. They understand the Mewuk language, and their hearing is so sharp
that they hear a person a long way off and know what he says.

Bears, like people, like to dance. Once an old Indian saw some bears
dance in the forest. He saw *Oo-soo'-ma-te* the old she Grizzly Bear and
a lot of little bears. The old she Bear leaned up against a young pine
tree with her left hip and bent it down, and sang *moo'-oo*, *moo'-oo*.
The little bears caught hold of the bent-over tree, hanging on with
their hands over their heads, while they danced with their hind feet on
the ground.
