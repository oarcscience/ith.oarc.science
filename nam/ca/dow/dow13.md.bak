### HOW THE PEOPLE GOT FIVE FINGERS; HOW THEY OBTAINED FIRE; AND HOW THEY BROKE UP INTO TRIBES

ALL the world was dark.

*Os-sā'-le* the Coyote-man and *Pe-tā'-le* the Lizard-man were First
People. They tried to make Indian people, each like himself. *Os-sā'-le*
said he was going to make man just like himself.

*Pe-tā'-le* said that would be absurd; "How could man eat or take hold
of anything if he had no fingers?"

So they quarrelled, and *Os-sā'-le* tried to kill *Pe-tā'-le*; but
*Pe-tā'-le* slid into a crack in a rock where *Os-sā'-le* could not
reach him. Then they talked and argued for a long time. After a while
*Pe-tā'-le* came out ahead and when they made people he gave them five
fingers.

The world was dark and everybody wanted light and fire. By and by
*Pe-tā'-le* the Lizard said, "I see smoke down in the valley; who will
go and get it. *Loo'-loo-e* the White-footed Mouse runs fast and plays
the flute well; he had better go." So *Loo'-loo-e* went with his flute
(*loo'-lah*) and found the home of the Valley People and played

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

for them. They liked his music and gave a big feast and asked him to
come into the roundhouse and play so that everyone might hear him.

*We'-pi-ah'-gah* the Eagle was chief of the Valley People and *Wek'-wek*
the Falcon lived with him. When all the people had assembled and
*Loo'-loo-e* the Mouse was there with his flute, Captain *We-pi-ah'-gah*
took the big feather blanket called *kook'-si-u*, made of feathers of
*Mol'-luk* the Condor, and closed the doorway with it and made it very
tight, for he had a feeling that *Loo'-loo-e* might try to steal
something and run off with it.

Then *Loo'-loo-e* took his flute and began to play; he lay on his back
and rocked to and fro and played for a long time. Everyone liked the
music and felt happy. In a little while they all became sleepy. Soon
*Loo'-loo-e* looked around and saw that they were asleep; but he kept on
playing till everybody was sound asleep. Then he got up and went to the
fire and stole it all--two small coals--and put them in his flute and
started to run away. But he could not get out of the roundhouse because
of the thick feather blanket which *We-pi-ah'-gah* had hung over the
doorway. So he stopped and cut a hole through it with his teeth and then
ran out and hurried toward the mountains.

After a while the people awoke and found that the fire was gone. They
were sure that *Loo'-loo-e* the Mouse had stolen it, and said, "Whom can
we

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

send who is fast enough to overtake him? Of all our people only
*Sah'-win-ne* the Hail and *Nuk'-kah* the Shower are fast enough." So
they sent these two to catch him. They rushed off toward the mountains
and overtook him.

He saw them coming and put one coal in the *oo'-noo* tree (buckeye) and
threw the other in the water. When *Sah'-win-ne* and *Nuk'-kah* caught
him they could not find the coals. He told them to look, he had nothing.
They looked and found nothing, and went back and told the Valley People.

Then *Loo'-loo-e* took the coal from the *oo'noo* tree and put it back
in his flute and ran up into the mountains with it and gave it to his
people, and they put it in the middle of the roundhouse. Before this
their country was dark, and they had always eaten their food raw. Now
they could see and could cook meat.

Then *Os-sā'-le* the Coyote-man brought the intestines of a deer and put
them on the fire, covering it up and nearly putting it out. Because of
his selfishness in doing this the people changed his name from
*Os-sā'-le* to *Kat'-wah* (greedy), which they call him to this day.

Then the people felt cold, and only those in the middle of the
roundhouse could talk as they had talked before. Those around the sides
were so cold that their teeth chattered and they could not talk plainly.
They separated into four groups on the four sides of the house--one on
the north, one

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

on the south, one on the east, and one on the west--and each group began
to speak differently from the others, and also differently from the one
in the middle. This is the way the speech of the people began to break
up into five languages, and this is the way the five tribes <span
id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) began--the people being driven apart by the
selfishness of Coyote.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_9"></span>[64:10](dow13.htm#fr_9.md) The *Me'wah* knew only
five tribes: their own; the people to the north, whom they call
*Tam-moo-lek* or *Tah-mah-lā'-ko* (from *Tah'-mah*, north); those on the
east, whom they call *Mo'-nok* or *He'-sah-duk* (from *He'-sum*, east);
those on the south, whom they call *Choo'-mat-tuk* (from *Choo'-match*,
south), and those on the west, whom they call *O'-loo-kuk* or
*Ol'-lo-kuk* (from *O'-lo-win* or *O'-lo-win*, meaning down west--in the
valley).
