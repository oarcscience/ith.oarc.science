### WHERE THE DUCKS AND GEESE GO TO BREED

*The Hookooeko of Tomales Bay say*:

The home of Ducks and Geese is far up the coast in the cold country
called *Kon'-win*, the North, which is on the other side of the sky. The
way to this country lies between two high hills which continually go
apart and come together, forming a sliding gateway which is ever opening
and closing--the hills are never still. <span

The name of these sliding hills is *Wal-le-kah'-pah*.

In spring when the Ducks and Geese go north they pass between the
*Wal'-le-kah'-pah* hills and make their nests and rear their young in
the cold *Kon'-win* country beyond; in fall they come back through the
same opening and bring their young with them.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_19"></span>[214:21](dow50.htm#fr_19.md) The gateway in this
little story is of course the North Hole in the sky, which is always
described as opening and closing with great rapidity, so that only the
swiftest personages can shoot through.
