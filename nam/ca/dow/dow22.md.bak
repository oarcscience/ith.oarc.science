### HOW THE CHILDREN OF HE-LE'-JAH BECAME PEOPLE

HE-LE'-JAH the Cougar or Mountain Lion had two wives, *Oo-soo'-ma-te*
the Grizzly Bear-woman and *Paht'-ki-yu* the Raccoon-woman. Their
children looked a little like people but still were not people. Every
year there were more children, and as they grew up and had children of
their own, the children came to look more and more like people, only
they had no fingers.

Then *Pe-tā'-le* the Lizard gave them five fingers and they became real
people (*Me'wuk*).
