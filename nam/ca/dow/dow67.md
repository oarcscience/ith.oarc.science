# Beliefs Concerning Witches, Pigmies, Giants, and other Fabulous Beings

### HOW WITCHES KILL PEOPLE

*The Hookooeko of Nicasio and San Rafael say*:

Our country is on the north side of San Francisco Bay and reaches from
San Rafael to Tomales Bay. Before the white man came and destroyed us
there used to be witches among the people. The people used to burn the
dead. Sometimes after a burning the witches would save the ashes and
burnt bones (called *me'-cham yem'-me-um*) and pound them up fine in a
stone mortar and use them to kill with. The witches had two ways of
killing people. One way was to put the powdered bones and ashes on the
windward side of the house or rancheria of the person they wished to
harm. Then the wind would blow the fine dust over the enemy. Next day he
would have a headache and feel sick, and every day grow worse until by
and by he died.

Another way was to take the hollow wing bone of a Turkey-buzzard and go
to windward of the person to be injured. The witch then blew through the
bone toward the person. The person soon had bad dreams and felt
lonesome, and next day went crazy, and after a while died.

With the right kind of a buzzard bone (called *to'-kah*) a witch could
blow harm to a person from a distance as great as two miles.
