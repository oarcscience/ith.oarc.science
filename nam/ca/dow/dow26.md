### THE DEFEAT OF O-LA'-NAH THE COYOTE-MAN

WEK'-WEK the Falcon-man and *O-lā'-nah* the Coyote-man lived a long time
ago.

*Wek'-wek* did not like *O-lā'-nah* because he was smart and always
pretended that he could do everything. So one day *Wek'-wek* said to
him, "Let's go and get wood; you are so smart and know so much and can
do so many things, let's see you take that big oak tree and bring it
home."

*O-lā'-nah* answered, "All right, I can do it."

*Wek'-wek* told him to go ahead and do it.

Then *O-lā'-nah* ran around and around the big oak tree and the roots
cracked and made a noise, and the tree shook, but it did not fall;
*O-lā'-nah* could not get it up; he made it shake four times but could
not make it fall.

*Wek'-wek*, who was watching from the top of a sycamore tree, said, "Do
that again; make the big oak tree shake again, the same as you did
before, you are so strong."

*O-lā'-nah* tried but could not do it.

Then *Wek'-wek* said: "What you said was not true; you bragged that you
could do everything but

you can not do any thing; now I have beaten you, haven't I?"

"Yes," answered *O-lā'-nah*, "You have beaten me; I am going away." Then
*O-lā'-nah* turned and howled as Coyotes howl and cried and said
"*how-loo'-loo-e, how-loo'-loo-e, how-loo'-loo-e*," and turned into a
real Coyote like the coyotes we have now. But he was angry and set upon
*O-hul'-le*, his wife (*O-hul'-le* was the Badger-woman), and whipped
her, and she ran away. *O-lā'-nah* followed and tried to hiring her
back, but she refused and would not come.

After *Wek'-wek* had beaten *O-lā'-nah* he had to get fire. So he went
up the Sacramento River to the place where trees grow, where the creeks
come down from the mountains, and took a piece of wood and made a small
hole in it and sprinkled in the hole some dry leaves of *Kutch'-um* the
sage-herb, and took a stick of *Lap'-pah*, the elderberry tree, and
whirled it between his hands, with one end in the hole in the wood, and
fire came in the dry *Kutch'-um* leaves and he had fire.
