### GHOSTS HIDE IN STUMPS AND WHIRLWINDS

*The Northern Mewuk say*:

Sometimes when passing *Too'-cha-mo* the stump you hear a noise inside;
it is *Soo-lek'-ko* the Ghost. You had better go right on, for if you
stop he might do you harm.

Whenever you see *Poo'-ki-yu* the Whirlwind whirling the dust around and
around and carrying it up into the air you may know that *Soo-lek'-ko*
the Ghost is inside, dancing and swinging round and round. You had
better not go near it but keep away.
