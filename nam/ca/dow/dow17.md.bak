# How they got the Fire

THE first fire was made by the Doctor Birds at the birth of *Wek'-wek*.
The next fire was made by *Ke'-lok* the North Giant. After *Ke'-lok's*
death and after his fire had burnt up the world and had burnt itself
out, there was no fire except that of the *Hul-luk mi-yum'-ko*, the
Star-women, which was close by the elderberry tree, way off in the east
where the Sun gets up.

*O-let'-te* said to his grandson, *Wek'-wek*: "Now we have people, and
elderberry music for the people, but we have no fire for them to cook
with; the Star-women have it; we must steal it."

"How?" asked *Wek'-wek*.

"Send *Koo-loo'-loo* the Humming-bird; he is faster than you. Tell him
to catch a little spark and bring it quickly," replied *O-let'-te*.

"All right," answered *Wek'-wek*, and he sent *Koo-loo'-loo* to fetch
the fire. *Koo-loo'-loo* shot out swiftly and soon reached the
Star-women by the elderberry tree in the far east, in the place where
the Sun gets up. Here he hid and watched and waited, and when he saw a
little spark of fire, he darted in and seized it and brought it back
quickly to *Wek'-wek* and *O-let'-te*. He held it tight under his chin,
and to this day if you look

under the Humming-bird's chin you will see the mark of the fire.

Then *Wek'-wek* asked: "Where shall we put it?"

*O-let'-te* answered, "Let us put it in *oo'-noo*, the buckeye tree,
where all the people can get it." So they put it in *oo'-noo*, the
buckeye tree, and even now whenever an Indian wants fire he goes to the
*oo'-noo* tree and gets it.

### FRAGMENT OF A HOO'-KOO-E'-KO VERSION

I have discovered fragments of a similar myth among the nearly extinct
*Hoo'-koo-e'-ko* north of San Francisco Bay. These people state that
*O'-ye* the Coyote-man sent *Koo-loo'-pis* the Hummingbird far away to
the east to steal the fire; that he brought it back to Coyote-man, and
that Coyote-man put it into the buckeye tree. They state also that
*Wek'-wek* once went a long way off and was killed, and that his
grandfather, *O'-ye* the Coyote-man, went after him and restored him to
life.
