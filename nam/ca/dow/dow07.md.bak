### HOW WIT'-TAB-BAH THE ROBIN GOT HIS RED BREAST

A LONG time ago the world was dark and cold and the people had no fire.
*Wit'-tab-bah* the Robin learned where the fire was and went on a far
journey to get it. After he had traveled a great distance he came to the
place and stole it and carried it back to the people. Every night on the
way he lay with his breast over it to keep it from getting cold; this
turned his breast red. Finally he reached home with it and gave it to
the people. Then he made the Sun out of it, but before doing this he put
some into the *oo'-noo* tree (the buckeye) so the people could get it
when they needed it. From that day to this all the people have known
that when they want fire they can get it by rubbing an *oo'-noo* stick
against a piece of dry wood; this makes the flame come out.
