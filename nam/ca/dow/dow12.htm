<p>After they had done this, <i>Pe-t&#257;'-le</i> wanted to turn into the Moon but <i>O-l&#257;'-choo</i> the Coyote-man and <i>Yu'-ka-loo</i> the Meadowlark-man would not allow him to do so.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_8"></A><A HREF="dow12.htm#fr_8">59:9</A> This reference to the moon is the only one I have discovered among the Mewuk creation myths. But the next people on the north--the Nissenan--count the Moon-man among the early divinities. The Southern Nissenan give the following account of the creation of man:</p>  
<p>In the beginning, <i>Pombok</i> the Moon-man, <i>O'-leh</i> the Coyote-man, and <i>Pit-chak</i> the Lizard-man decided to make people but differed as to what the first man should be like, for each of the three wanted man to be like himself.</p>  
<p>After they had argued a long time they finally agreed that man should have a round face like the Moon-man, but they could not agree as to his hands. Coyote-man insisted that he should have paws like his own, but Lizard-man said that paws would be of no use-that man should have five fingers so he could take hold of things. Finally Lizard-man carried his point and gave man five long fingers like his own.</p>  
<p>Coyote-man never forgave him, and to this day the Coyote hunts the lizard and kills him whenever he can.</P>
