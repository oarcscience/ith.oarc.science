### NEK'-NA-KA'-TAH THE ROCK MAIDEN

IN the mountains among the rocks by the river lives *Nek'-na-kā'-tah*,
the little rock girl. She is herself a rock and always lives in rocky
places by the river. In some way she produces or gives off people; these
people are hard like rocks and you can not cut them or shoot them with
an arrow.

A long time ago *Oo-soo'-ma-te* the Grizzly Bear and *Hoi-yah'-ko* the
FIRST PEOPLE, made the Chaw'-se or mortar holes in the big flat-topped
rocks. Then *Nek'-na-kā'-tah* the rock maiden came and helped make the
*Kah-wah'-che* or stone pestles for the people to pound acorns with.
