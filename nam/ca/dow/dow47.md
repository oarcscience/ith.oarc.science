### SOO-KOO'-ME THE GREAT HORNED OWL

*The Middle Mewuk of Tuolumne River foothills say*:

When *Soo-koo'-me* the Great Horned Owl hoots, it means that someone is
dying. He is himself the Ghosts of dead people. <span

\[I was once asked by a Northern Mewuk if I had ever seen the broad belt
of bony plates which surrounds the eyeball of the Great Horned Owl. On
replying that I had, I was assured that these closely imbricating plates
are the "finger nails all jammed tight together of the ghosts caught by
the owl."\]
