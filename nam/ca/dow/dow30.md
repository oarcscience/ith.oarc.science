### WHY THE BODEGA BAY INDIANS CAN NOT STAND COLD

WHEN *O'-ye* the Coyote-man had everything ready he thought he would
make people. So he gathered a lot of sticks of different kinds--some
hard, as oak, madrone, and manzanita; some soft and hollow, as the
sage-herb--and made a big pile of them and said that by and by they
would turn into people.

Then he went over all the country and whereever he wanted a village he
laid down two sticks, and gave the place a name--and the name he gave it
then has always been its name and is its name to this day. Then he went
away.

In a short time the sticks turned into people, and all the rancherias
were started with the first real people.

In places where he had put sticks of hard wood the people were strong
and well and warm-blooded and could stand cold weather; but in places
where he put poor wood the people were weak and sickly and could not
stand cold weather. Here at Bodega Bay he left only sticks of

which has a hollow stem and has no strength. That is the reason our
people are tender and weak

and can not stand cold, and why nearly all died soon after the white men
came. We are hollow inside and can not stand cold.
