<p>THE first fire was made by the Doctor Birds at the birth of <i>Wek'-wek</i>. The next fire was made by <i>Ke'-lok</i> the North Giant. After <i>Ke'-lok's</i> death and after his fire had burnt up the world and had burnt itself out, there was no fire except that of the <i>Hul-luk mi-yum'-ko</i>, the Star-women, which was close by the elderberry tree, way off in the east where the Sun gets up.</p>  
<p><i>O-let'-te</i> said to his grandson, <i>Wek'-wek</i>: "Now we have people, and elderberry music for the people, but we have no fire for them to cook with; the Star-women have it; we must steal it."</p>  
<p>"How?" asked <i>Wek'-wek</i>.</p>  
<p>"Send <i>Koo-loo'-loo</i> the Humming-bird; he is faster than you. Tell him to catch a little spark and bring it quickly," replied <i>O-let'-te</i>.</p>  
<p>"All right," answered <i>Wek'-wek</i>, and he sent <i>Koo-loo'-loo</i> to fetch the fire. <i>Koo-loo'-loo</i> shot out swiftly and soon reached the Star-women by the elderberry tree in the far east, in the place where the Sun gets up. Here he hid and watched and waited, and when he saw a little spark of fire, he darted in and seized it and brought it back quickly to <i>Wek'-wek</i> and <i>O-let'-te</i>. He held it tight under his chin, and to this day if you look</p>

<p>under the Humming-bird's chin you will see the mark of the fire.</p>  
<p>Then <i>Wek'-wek</i> asked: "Where shall we put it?"</p>  
<p><i>O-let'-te</i> answered, "Let us put it in <i>oo'-noo</i>, the buckeye tree, where all the people can get it." So they put it in <i>oo'-noo</i>, the buckeye tree, and even now whenever an Indian wants fire he goes to the <i>oo'-noo</i> tree and gets it.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">FRAGMENT OF A HOO'-KOO-E'-KO VERSION</h3>  
<p>I have discovered fragments of a similar myth among the nearly extinct <i>Hoo'-koo-e'-ko</i> north of San Francisco Bay. These people state that <i>O'-ye</i> the Coyote-man sent <i>Koo-loo'-pis</i> the Hummingbird far away to the east to steal the fire; that he brought it back to Coyote-man, and that Coyote-man put it into the buckeye tree. They state also that <i>Wek'-wek</i> once went a long way off and was killed, and that his grandfather, <i>O'-ye</i> the Coyote-man, went after him and restored him to life.</p>
