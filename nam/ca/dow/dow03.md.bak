# Preface

IT is our custom to go abroad for the early beliefs of mankind and to
teach our children the mythologies of foreign lands, unmindful of the
wealth and beauty of our American folk-tales. The present collection
invites attention to the unique and entertaining character of the myths
of some of our California Indians.

These tales were told me by the Indians of a single stock, the Mewan,
the tribes of which are confined to central California and have no known
relatives in any part of the world. They have been little visited by
ethnologists and during the few years that have passed since the tales
were collected, several of the tribes have become extinct.

The myths are related by the old people after the first rains of the
winter season, usually in the ceremonial roundhouse and always at night
by the dim light of a small flickering fire. They constitute the
religious history of the tribe, and from time immemorial have been
handed down by word of mouth; from generation to generation they have
been repeated, without loss and without addition.

The conceptions of the Indians concerning the forces of nature and the
character and attributes of the early inhabitants of the earth differ so
radically

from our own that an explanation seems necessary. This is supplied by
the Introduction, which is intended to give the reader the view point
necessary for the full appreciation and enjoyment of the tales.
