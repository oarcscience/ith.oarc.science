### LOO-POO-OI'-YES THE ROCK GIANT OF TAMALPAIS

*The Hookooeko of Nicasio and San Rafael say*:

A woman had a husband and two boy babies--

twins. The woman's brother killed her husband and the little boys did
not know that they ever had a father. When they were big enough they
went off every day to play by a big rock in the woods. They went always
to the same place; they liked this place and always went there. This was
the very place where their father, when he was alive, used to go every
day to sing, but the little boys did not know this--for they did not
even know that they had ever had a father.

One day the boys heard somebody say: "You come here every day just as
your father used to." The voice came from the rock; it was the voice of
*Loo'-poo-oi'-yes* <span id="fr_29"></span>[31](#fn_29.md) the Rock Giant.
Then the boys knew they had had a father. They went to the rock and saw
long hairs sticking up. These hairs grew out of the nostrils of
*Loo'-poo-oi'-yes*; the boys took hold of them and pulled them out.

This made *Loo'-poo-oi'-yes* angry and he took a long hooked stick and
tried to catch the boys to kill them. He was all rock except a place on
his throat where he wore an abalone shell. The boys, saw this and shot
their arrows through it and killed him. When he died he fell to pieces;
the pieces were rocks and scattered over the ground. Inside he was flesh
like other people, but outside he was rock, except the place on his
throat where the abalone shell was.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_29"></span>[235:31](dow73.htm#fr_29.md) The name
*Loo'-poo-oi'-yes* means literally *the old man of rock*, from *loo'poo*
rock, and *oi'yes* old man.
