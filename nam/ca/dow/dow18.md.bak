### How Kah'-kool the Raven Became a Great Hunter

A LONG time ago *Too'-le* the Evening Star lived at *Oo'-tin* \[Bower
Cave, on the Coulterville road to Yosemite\]. *He-le'-jah* the Mountain
Lion lived with him. They were chiefs and partners and had a room on the
north side of the cave. There were other people here also *To-lo'-mah*
the Wild Cat, *Yu'-wel* the Gray Fox, *Kah'-kool* the Raven, and many
more.

They used to send out hunters for meat. One of these, *Kah'-kool* the
Raven, complained to *Too'-le* and *He-le'-jah* that he could not come
near enough the game to shoot; the animals saw him too easily--he was
too light colored. So he decided to make himself black; he took some
charcoal and mashed it in a basket and rubbed it all over his body
wherever he could reach, and had the others help put it on his back
where he could not reach. When he was black all over he went hunting and
killed two or three animals the first day, for now they could not see
him.

One day *Kah'-kool* went to Big Meadows and climbed on top of Pile Peak,
and when the moon rose, he saw away in the east two big things like ears
standing up. He had never seen anything like

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

them before and ran back to *Oo'-tin* and told the Chiefs. He said the
animal must be very big and very wild, for it turned its big ears every
way. He wanted to see it.

Every evening he went back to the peak and saw the ears in the east, and
each time they were a little nearer. But he did not yet know what the
animal was. Then he went again and this time the ears were only two or
three miles away, and he ran back quickly and told the Chiefs that the
new animals were coming. They were Deer coming over the mountains from
the east; they had never been here before.

The next morning *Kah'-kool* went out and for the first time in his life
saw a bunch of Deer; but he did not know what they were. He saw that
they stepped quickly, and that some of them had horns. So he ran back
and told *Too'-le* and *He-le'-jah* what he had seen, and said that the
new animals looked good to eat and he wanted to kill one.

"All right, "answered the Chiefs, "If you see one on our side <span
id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md) go ahead and kill him."

So the next morning *Kah'-kool* again went out and saw that the animals
had come much nearer and were pretty close. He hid behind a tree and
they came still nearer. He picked out a big one and shot his arrow into
it and killed it, for he wanted

to try the meat. He watched it kick and roll over and die, and then went
back and told the Chiefs that he had killed one and wanted two men to go
with him and fetch it. The Chiefs sent two men with him, but when they
got there they had nothing to cut it with and had to carry it home
whole. One took it by the front feet, the other by the hind feet; they
carried it to the cave and showed it to the Chiefs.

*He-le'-jah* said it was a Deer and was good to eat, and told the people
to skin it. They did so and ate it all at one meal.

Next morning *Kah'-kool* returned alone to the same place and followed
the tracks and soon found the Deer. He hid behind a tree and shot one.
The others ran, but he shot his arrows so quickly that they made only a
few jumps before he had killed five--enough for all the people. He did
not want to kill all; he wanted to leave some bucks and does so there
would be more.

This time the Chiefs sent five men with *Kah'-kool*. They took flint
knives and skinned the Deer and carried home all the meat and intestines
for supper and breakfast.

Chief *Too'-le* the Evening Star told *Kah'-kool* that he wanted to see
how the Deer walked, and would hunt with him. *Kah'-kool* replied that
he was too light--too shiny--and would scare the Deer. *Too'-le* said he
would hide behind a tree and not show himself. So he went, and
*Kah'-kool* kept him

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

behind. But he was so bright that the Deer saw him and ran away.
*Too'-le* said, "What am I going to do?" *Kah'-kool* made no answer; he
was angry because he had to go home without any meat.

Next morning *Too'-le* went again. He said he was smart and knew what he
would do. The Deer had now made a trail. *Too'-le* dug a hole by the
trail and covered himself up with leaves and thought that when the Deer
came he would catch one by the foot. But when the Deer came they saw his
eye shine and ran away.

The next morning he tried again. He said that this time he would bury
himself eye and all, and catch a Deer by the foot. *Kah'-kool* answered,
"You can't catch one that way, you will have to shoot him." But
*Too'-le* dug a hole in another place in the trail and covered himself
all up, eye and all, except the tips of his fingers. The Deer came and
saw the tips of his fingers shine and ran away. So again the hunters had
to go back without any meat.

Then *Too'-le* the Evening Star said, "I'm going to black myself with
charcoal, the same as *Kah'-kool* did." He tried, but the charcoal would
not stick--he was too bright. He said, "I don't know what to do; I want
to kill one or two Deer." Then he tried again and mashed more charcoal
and put it on thick. The others helped him and finally made him black
all over. *Too'-le* did not know that the Deer could smell him, and
again hid on

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

the trail. The Deer came again. This time the doe was ahead, the buck
behind. The leader, the doe, smelled him and jumped over him; the buck
smelled him and ran back. So this time also *Too'-le* and *Kah'-kool*
had to go home without meat.

The next morning *Too'-le* tried once more. He had two men blacken him
all over. Then he went to the trail and stood still between two trees.
But the Deer smelled him and swung around and ran away and went down
west to the low country. This discouraged him so that he did not know
what to do, and he gave up hunting and stayed at home.

Then *Kah'-kool* began to hunt again; he went every morning alone and
killed five or ten Deer. The people ate the meat and intestines and all,
but did not have enough. Then *Kah'-kool* worked harder; he started very
early in the morning, before daylight, and killed twelve to fifteen Deer
every day. This was too much for him and before long he took sick and
could not hunt at all.

Then the Chiefs and all the others had nothing to eat and did not know
what to do. *Too'-le* asked *He-le'-jah*, and *He-le'-jah* asked
*Too'-le*, what they should do. *He-le'-jah* said he would stay and kill
his own Deer and eat the liver only--not the meat--and would eat it raw.
*Too'-le* said he would go up into the sky and stay there and become the
Evening Star. And each did as he had said. So the rancheria at *Oo'-tin*
was broken up.
