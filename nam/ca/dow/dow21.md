### THE BEAR AND THE FAWNS

A story sung by the Middle Mewuk

OO-SOO'-MA-TE the Grizzly Bear killed *Ut-too'-yah* the Mother Deer.
*Oo-soo'-ma-te* killed her and *He-le'-jah* the Mountain Lion ate her.
The Mother Deer had two little fawns. They missed their mother*--*and
asked *Oo-soo'-ma-te* where she was. *Oo-soo'-ma-te* answered, "She is
resting," and pointing to the house said, "Go in there where you will be
safe till she comes back."

They went in, singing for their mother to come back, for they were
starving. When they were inside, *Oo-soo'-ma-te* closed the door so they
could not get out.

Then the fawns felt sure that *Oo-soo'-ma-te* had killed their mother
and was intending to kill them. So they fastened the door of the Bear's
house on the inside so she could not get in. Then a kind
one--*Te-wi'-yu* the Red-shafted Flicker--brought them fire and they put
it in the middle of the house and put on a number of rocks to heat.

When *Oo-soo'-ma-te* came home she was unable to get in and called to
the fawns, saying, "I want to come in; where is the door?"

They answered, "Try the west side."

She tried, but could not find any door.

Then they called to her to try the north side, and she did so, but could
not find it.

Then they told her to try the cast side, and she did, with no better
success; then the south side, with the same result.

This made *Oo-soo'-ma-te* very angry and she shouted, "If you don't open
the door and let me in I'll come and eat you."

Then they told her to climb up on top and come in through the smoke
hole, and to back down or she would fall and break her neck.

So she climbed up on top and began to back down through the smoke hole.
But by this time the rocks were hot, and while she was trying to squeeze
through the hole the fawns took the hot rocks and burned her to death.
