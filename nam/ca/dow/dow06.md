# Part I: Ancient Myths

### STORIES OF THE FIRST PEOPLE--PEOPLE WHO LIVED BEFORE REAL PEOPLE WERE CREATED

The Mewuk tribes, those inhabiting the western slopes and foothills of
the Sierra, call the ancient myths *oo'-ten-ne* or *oot'-ne*, meaning
the history of the FIRST PEOPLE. (The Northern Mewuk say *oo'-ten
nas'-se-sa*.) In this connection it may be significant that the name of
Bower Cave, the home of *Too'-le* and *He-le'-jah*, two great chiefs of
the FIRST PEOPLE, is *Oo'-tin*.
