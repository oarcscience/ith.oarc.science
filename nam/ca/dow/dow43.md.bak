### HOW TOO-LE'-ZE, THE TIMBER-WOLF HUNTS DEER

*The Northern Mewuk say*:

*Too-le'-ze* the Big Wolf is a hunter. Like *He-le'-jah* the Cougar or
Mountain Lion he hunts Deer, but he hunts in a different way. He chases
them like *Choo'-koo* the Dog but catches them by the throat with his
claws, which he sinks deep into the sides of the throat. In the early
morning he howls long howls. He used to be common here but now is rarely
seen.
