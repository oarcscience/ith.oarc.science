### TOO'-CHA-MO, THE STUMP, AND CHOO'-KOO HENG-IL'-NAH-AS'-SE, THE LOST DOG

*The Northern Mewuk say*:

*Too'-cha-mo* the stump and *Choo'-koo* the dog are friends. When
*Choo'-koo* is lost and does not know where his man has gone he goes to
*Too'-cha-mo* and asks. *Too'-cha-mo* tells him which way to go to
strike his man's trail; *Choo'-koo* goes and finds it, and no matter how
far away his man is, he follows the trail right to him.
