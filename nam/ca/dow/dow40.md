# Part 2: Present Day Myths

In addition to the Ancient Myths or FIRST PEOPLE stories, which relate
to the early history of the world, the Mewan tribes have numerous
beliefs concerning the present and the very recent past. Some of
these--mainly fragments or outlines, but covering a wide range of
subjects--have been collected from nearly all the extant tribes and are
here brought together. They are arranged under the following headings:
Beliefs concerning Animals; Beliefs concerning Ghosts and the Sign of
Death; Beliefs concerning Natural Phenomena; Beliefs concerning Witches,
Pigmies, Giants, and other Fabulous Beings.
