### THE COYOTE AND THE LIZARD

O-LA'-CHOO the Coyote-man and *Pe-tā'-le* the little Lizard-man made the
world and everything in it.

After they had done this, *Pe-tā'-le* wanted to turn into the Moon but
*O-lā'-choo* the Coyote-man and *Yu'-ka-loo* the Meadowlark-man would
not allow him to do so. <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_8"></span>[59:9](dow12.htm#fr_8.md) This reference to the moon
is the only one I have discovered among the Mewuk creation myths. But
the next people on the north--the Nissenan--count the Moon-man among the
early divinities. The Southern Nissenan give the following account of
the creation of man:

In the beginning, *Pombok* the Moon-man, *O'-leh* the Coyote-man, and
*Pit-chak* the Lizard-man decided to make people but differed as to what
the first man should be like, for each of the three wanted man to be
like himself.

After they had argued a long time they finally agreed that man should
have a round face like the Moon-man, but they could not agree as to his
hands. Coyote-man insisted that he should have paws like his own, but
Lizard-man said that paws would be of no use-that man should have five
fingers so he could take hold of things. Finally Lizard-man carried his
point and gave man five long fingers like his own.

Coyote-man never forgave him, and to this day the Coyote hunts the
lizard and kills him whenever he can.
