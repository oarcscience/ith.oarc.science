### THE FLOOD. <span id="fr_302"></span>[286](#fn_296.md)

There is a wonderful little knoll, near Bonsall, the Spanish name of it
Mora, the Indian name Katuta; <span id="fr_303"></span>[287](#fn_297.md)
and when there was a flood that killed all the people, some stayed on
this hill and were not drowned. All the high mountains were covered, but
this little hill remained above the water. One can see heaps of
seashells and seaweed upon it, and ashes where those people cooked their
food, and stones set together, left as they used them for cooking; and
the shells were those of shell-fish they caught to eat. <span
id="fr_304"></span>[288](#fn_298.md)

They stayed there till the water went down. From the top of this hill
one can see that the high mountains are lower than it is. This hill was
one of the First People. <span id="fr_305"></span>[289](#fn_299.md)

<span id="fn_297"></span>[157:287](roli25.htm#fr_303.md) Or Katuktu; see
song records 395 and 398 above.—Katukto.—S.

<span id="fn_298"></span>[157:288](roli25.htm#fr_304.md) The hills near Del
Mar and other places along the coast have many such heaps of sea-shells,
of the species still found on the beaches, piled in quantities.
