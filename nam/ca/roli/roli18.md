### A CHUNGICHNISH STORY. <span id="fr_273"></span>[258](#fn_268)

Among the people living near El Toro, there was a boy who was always
hunting rabbits, quail, and the like with bow and arrows. One day, near
Santa Ana, he saw a rabbit which he tried to catch, but it ran into a
hole in the ground. He got a stick and poked in the hole. He felt the
rabbit, so he kept on digging, and went farther and farther down, every
little while finding something, which, he would say, "I will take to my
mother," "to my sister," and so on.

So he went on, and finally came to a place where those Chungichnish were
living. They all said, "Witte,"—"Welcome"—to him, and told him to sit
down. Then they built a big fire, a very large fire. The boy was very
sad. He did not know what to do. There he was down in the ground among
those people. He was afraid.

These people had power and could do anything. They would stand up, leap,
jump, and dance moving about, jump into the fire and stand in the middle
of it, the flames going up above their heads. All took turns in doing
this; then they said to the boy: "It is your turn now." He was
frightened, but he sang a song, a sort of invocation, <span

no heat, and after standing there awhile he came out unharmed. They all
shouted and said, "Now you are a good Chungichnish."

This is the reason people dance in that way, jumping and moving about.
