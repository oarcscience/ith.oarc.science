### THE DANCE OF THE SPIRITS.

There were two large villages in old times, Kamak, where Potrero is
now, <span id="fr_294"></span>[278](#fn_288.md) and Ahoya near where
Sparkman's store is at Rincon, <span id="fr_295"></span>[279](#fn_289.md)
where one leaves the sycamore trees.

When it was time to gather the acorns, all the people of Kamak left
their houses empty and went up on Palomar Mountain.

An old man named Pautovak came up from Ahoya, and stopped at Kamak,
thinking he would stay all night and go on in the morning. He took one
of the enormous storage baskets, mushkwanish, <span
id="fr_296"></span>[280](#fn_290.md) that was empty, inverted it over
himself for shelter, and went to sleep.

Early during the night he heard people call out the summons to a dance.
He lay and listened.

There were children among the people, little boys, and they came near
the granary basket, and there was a torn place in it where the toes of
the old man were sticking out. The boys said "the devil" (a spirit) was
there, and ran away.

The old man could recognize the voices of men and women who had died
long ago. He could hear the spirits talk and hear them laugh. One was
Exwanyawish, <span id="fr_297"></span>[281](#fn_291.md) the woman that was
turned into a rock, and Piyevla, <span id="fr_298"></span>[282](#fn_292.md)
the man that scooped the rock with his fingers. <span
id="fr_299"></span>[283](#fn_293.md) Piyevla sang that night all the songs
that had been his when alive.

The old man could hear the women's songs as they danced. He lay awake
all night and listened; till at last, just before dawn, he could not
wait any longer, but determined to see them for himself; so suddenly
throwing off the basket, he said, "Hai, are you there? " and immediately
all the spirits turned into a flock of birds and flew away; and the
turtle-shell rattle they had used all night for the dancing he found
where they had left it, but now it was nothing but a piece of soaproot.
