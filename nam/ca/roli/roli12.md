*The Religion of the Luiseño Indians of Southern California*, by
Constance Goddard DuBois, \[1908\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

### THE NOTISH CEREMONY.

Another form of the Image mourning-ceremony was known to the Luiseños as
having been in use among the Indians of the north; and, though never
performed among the mountain Luiseños, it was celebrated at least once
at San Luis Rey, for Lucario Cuevish remembers to have seen it there.

Salvador Cuevas, who never saw this form of the ceremony, gives the
sacred basket pole as one of the children of the Earth-mother, sent by
her to the north.

This ritual for the dead was called Notish <span
id="fr_60"></span>[53](#fn_57) or Kutumit. <span
id="fr_61"></span>[54](#fn_58) The chief feature of it was a tall
painted pole called Kimul Chehenish, <span
id="fr_62"></span>[55](#fn_59) made very smooth from the trunk of a pine
or fir, which was hung with baskets at the top to be reached by climbing

as a contest of skill. This pole was as high as a house and was painted
with different colors. It represented the dead man, the spirit.
Different parts of the pole were painted in different colors to refer to
the different parts of the body. The pole was not painted with the shape
of a man, but one part of the painting meant the knee, another the arm,
and so on. The top for the head was always painted white.

On top was fastened the dressed skin of a crow or raven, the same they
laid on the breast of Ouiot when they burned him. When the pole was set
up they danced and sang.

Notish was a more elaborate form of the mourning-ceremony, in which it
was necessary that great stores of food should be provided, and
different villages were invited to participate. Contests of skill were a
feature of the occasion. The simpler form of the Image ceremony can be
performed by one village alone. <span id="fr_63"></span>[56](#fn_60)
