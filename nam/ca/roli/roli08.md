### THE CHUNGICHNISH CEREMONY OF UNISH MATAKISH.

The sand-painting was used also in the ceremony of Unish Matakish, <span
id="fr_37"></span>[34](#fn_34.md) the burying of the feathers of a
Chungichnish initiate.

When a man died who had drunk toloache in his youth, if he still had in
his possession the feather head-dress, sacred stick, paviut, and other
ceremonial implements, the chief of his "party" or clan would go and get
these objects and bury them.

Many of the features of the toloache fiesta were repeated.

The chief calls the people, and gets out the tamyush and all the sacred
objects. He cleans the tamyush—they are buried in the ground when not in
use—and paints them and sets them all together. They have two places, as
in the Mani. In one place they prepare these things; and in the other
they make the sand-painting. This has a gap to the north, and the
rattlesnake is

painted near the gap. Tukmul, the winnowing basket, is represented in
the painting, too. It is Chungichnish. <span
id="fr_38"></span>[35](#fn_35.md)

After everything is ready, the Paha calls out three times; and they come
marching and singing a solemn recitative. The chief who made the
sand-painting takes the feather head-dress, and the other things to be
buried, in his hand, and goes ahead of the others as they sing the
Chungichnish songs which mention the stones and sacred objects, always
ending with tamyush.

They sing as they reach the main place where the sand-painting is. The
feathers and objects are placed in the central hole of the painting, and
are buried by pushing the sand slowly forward, obliterating the painting
and filling the hole at the same time, to the accompaniment of a
recitative invocation.

The Chungichnish songs, sung at this ceremony, are not subject to the
law of clan ownership, but may be sung by all, as they do not belong to
any one family or party. No one composed them. They were made and given
by Chungichnish himself.
