### ORIGIN OF THE NOTISH MOURNING CEREMONY. <span id="fr_265"></span>[250](#fn_260.md)

The Sea-fog, Awawit, was the one who started the Notish ceremony. He was
one of those who arranged all the ceremonies after the death of Ouiot.
He was the one who had to provide the food and to call all the people
together.

Sea-fog set up the kutumit pole with baskets at the top, and arranged
for a contest of skill between his people of the West and those of the
mountains. The Western people were sure that they could do better in
everything than the people of the mountains. <span
id="fr_266"></span>[251](#fn_261.md)

So everyone tried to climb the pole to get the baskets, but no one could
reach the top except the squirrel from the mountains, and he climbed the
pole, cut the string, and the baskets fell down.

When the mountain people went to this gathering, they took deer meat and
much food, all they could carry; but Mechish from the ocean, a sea
animal that crawls along, and has little hollows or cups in his shell,
got a bag and got all the food in that and carried it off. So the West
won in that contest and got all the mountain people's food. In the first
game the squirrel beat. In the second the West beat.

Then the Western people gathered fish and other things to eat. There was
a bird there from the mountains with a very big mouth (the
whip-poor-will?), and the mountain people said to

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

him: "It is your turn now to eat." He said: "That is nothing for me to
do." So he opened his mouth and they poured everything into it, and he
ate it all up. So the mountain people beat.

Then they arranged a game between the fish and the owl. They were to
look straight at each other and whoever closed his eyes first was to
lose. The owl and the fish sat and looked at each other, and finally the
owl had to close his eyes, so he lost, and the Western people won on
that.

They were getting angry over all this contest and it seemed that there
would be a fight. When levalwish, the crow's skin, <span
id="fr_267"></span>[252](#fn_262.md) is hung on the pole, there is to be
fighting.

Then Sea-fog made a house and told the mountain people to try to destroy
it. So they got the summer-cloud, Thunder-cloud, a very powerful man, to
come and see if he could blow or break it down. He came, he roared and
blew, but could do nothing to break the house down. So the West won.
Then Thunder-cloud invited Sea-fog to come up to his house and see if he
could destroy it. So Sea-fog came. A strong wind broke the trees and
knocked down all the houses. So the West won again. Then they tried
their skill in a long race. They went past Pala up through the mountains
as far as La Jolla. <span id="fr_268"></span>[253](#fn_263.md) Some of
those that raced on the side of the mountain people were the hawk, frog,
eagle, raven, and chicken-hawk; and for the West, Emamul (little birds
on the seashore, very fast runners), <span
id="fr_269"></span>[254](#fn_264.md) the butterfly, grasshopper, and
others. As they came by Pala to the foot of the mountain, at Rincon,
Wasimul, <span id="fr_270"></span>[255](#fn_265.md) a kind of hawk, gave
out in the race, and there he is now as a rock beside the road, right
below the store. (See Ancestral Songs.) At the same time Chehuka, <span
id="fr_271"></span>[256](#fn_266.md) a person, coming along in the race,
gave out, and his footprint can still be seen in the rock. When many of
the racers had given out and died, or stayed behind, the eagle and the
raven and the chicken-hawk, Mountain people, were ahead; and the
grasshopper and

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

the butterfly, Western people, were close behind, so the Mountain people
won in this race.

The last race was between the deer, Sukut, and the antelope, Tonla. This
race was from Temecula to San Bernardino mountain, and the antelope beat
in this, for it was all on a level, where the antelope can go fastest.
So they arranged to have another race between them, and this time it was
over a mountain route, and here the deer won the race.

Summer-cloud (Thunder-cloud) was glad because the deer beat, and the
mountain people had won in most of the contests. <span
id="fr_272"></span>[257](#fn_267.md) All these contests were made in the
first Notish ceremony and ended it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_260"></span>[148:250](roli17.htm#fr_265.md) Told by Lucario
Cuevish.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[148:251](roli17.htm#fr_266.md) The place where
the ceremony was held can still be seen. It is where the trees stand
around in a circle, and ashes and stones used for cooking are there. It
is on the mountain ridge from Pala going towards Temecula. Compare the
description of the place near Temecula where the sun was raised, given
by the same informant ([p. 144](roli16.htm#page_144.md), note
[244](roli16.htm#fn_254).md).

<span id="fn_262"></span>[149:252](roli17.htm#fr_267.md) Levalvush, wide; a
rare word.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[149:253](roli17.htm#fr_268.md) Lucario, probably
on account of his blindness, is inclined to give a very limited account
of distance. All the others say that this race was to be made out to the
desert and back again.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[149:254](roli17.htm#fr_269.md) Emamal, a small
bird.—S.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[149:255](roli17.htm#fr_270.md) Wasimal, a hawk
that nests on the ground.—S.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[149:256](roli17.htm#fr_271.md) Chahuka, a person
that lived in the distant past.—S.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[150:257](roli17.htm#fr_272.md) It is evident that
certain trials of skill have been forgotten by the narrator, as in his
list the mountain people are not ahead.
