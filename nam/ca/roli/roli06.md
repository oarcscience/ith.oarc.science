### THE SAND PAINTING.

The sand-painting was first done by Tukwut, Iswut, and Mesmal
Awawit, <span id="fr_23"></span>[23](#fn_23.md) Mountain Lion, Wolf, and
Sea Fog. They were people and great medicine men, and were the first to
institute Mani. It was after Ouiot died that they made all the rituals
and ceremonies.

The sand-painting was used in four ceremonies: Mani, the toloache
ritual; Wukunish, the girl's ceremony; the ant-ordeal; and in Unish
Matakish, <span id="fr_24"></span>[24](#fn_24.md) the ceremony for burying
the feathers of a toloache initiate when he died. <span
id="fr_25"></span>[25](#fn_25.md)

Since my authorities differed concerning it, it was with difficulty that
I obtained anything like a complete understanding of the sand-painting;
and it was not until all my notes were collated and compared that I
decided that the main reason for these differences was the fact that
some of the old men were describing one form of sand-painting and some
another; that those were wrong who maintained that the girls’ and boys’
sand-paintings were alike; that there were in fact two forms of which
one only was distinctly remembered by most of them.

The only alternative is to imagine that different practices prevailed in
this matter in the old days.

As all were agreed concerning the sand-painting used in the girls’
ceremony, this will be first described.

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

A central hole is dug, and the sand removed from it is taken to make a
heaped-up circle about two feet in diameter, the width of the heaped-up
border being about three or four inches.

This circle is then painted by sprinkling it with different colored
sands or ground paint and powdered charcoal. The outer. edge is made
white, the middle red, the inner edge black.

The central hole is defined in the same way, white outermost, red in the
center, black nearest the hole.

Three concentric circular rows of nine points each <span
id="fr_26"></span>[26](#fn_26.md) are made pointing outwards from the
central hole; the outermost row of points are white, the next circle of
points red, those nearest the hole black.

A sand-painting was made for the author, which is shown in [plate
2](roli32.htm#img_pl02.md). For convenience in photographing it was done
chiefly in white. The outer enclosing circle, however, shows the red and
black.

According to one authority the three circles forming the circumference
mean, the white outer one the Milky Way; the red central one,
tukmit <span id="fr_27"></span>[27](#fn_27.md) the sky; the black inner
one, chum kwinamul, <span id="fr_28"></span>[27](#fn_27.md) our spirit.
According to another, the outer circle of white is the Milky Way; the
middle of red, chum towi <span id="fr_29"></span>[27](#fn_27.md) our
spirit; the inner of black, kwinamish, <span
id="fr_30"></span>[27](#fn_27.md) the spirit. Another gives these as chum
towi, chum wanamul, chum kwinamul, all meaning our spirit; the central
one referring to the Milky Way, which he places in that position, making
the white circle central and uppermost. Wanamul seems to include the
stem which is found in wanawut, as if spirit and Milky Way were
synonymous. <span id="fr_31"></span>[28](#fn_28.md)

The sand-painting represents the world. The sky bending above is
supposed to rest upon the circle of the Milky Way. The whole of the
visible universe is thus represented.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

All the authorities but one maintain that there is a "door" to the north
to allow the escape of the spirit. The informant who denies this has
either forgotten, or he belongs to a line of descent, a 'clan,' in which
the ceremony was modified.

The gate towards the north is shown in the photograph. The Earth-mother
lies with her feet to the north. <span id="fr_32"></span>[29](#fn_29.md)
Those who laid Ouiot on the funeral pile stood facing that way. All
ceremonies and invocations are performed facing the north.

In the outer circle of points or diamond-shaped divisions, in the second
one from the door, is a small circle of sand. This represents the sea,
which according to one version of the creation myth, gives us the breath
of life which fills our lungs.

In the next division is a small heap of sand; this is kawima hulwul,
that is, the little hill of hulwul, <span id="fr_33"></span>[30](#fn_30.md)
the sacred Chungichnish plant that grows on the hills, which punishes
the transgressor; how, it is not known.

In the sixth division, counting in the same direction, is a larger hill
combining the meaning of four Chungichnish avengers: sowut, hunwut,
tukwut, iswut, that is, rattlesnake, bear, mountain lion, wolf.

In the middle circle of points, in the fourth division, there is another
small heap of sand. This means mukil, boil or abscess, which is a
Chungichnish avenger and sent to punish those who do not fast for the
appointed time, or who secretly steal meat or salt during the fast.

The name of the sand-painting is eskanish tarohayish, a double name.
Eskanish means any kind of images or figures, and after the habit of
Luiseño double terms is qualified, as it were, by tarohayish which means
this particular kind of image. It is also called nahish. <span
id="fr_34"></span>[31](#fn_31.md)

Into the central hole of the sand-painting, the girls spit the lump of
sage seed and salt at the conclusion of the ceremony. In this hole also
are buried the feathers of the toloache initiate

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

after his death. The hole in this case must be made larger. In the
girls’ sand-painting the hole is about four inches in diameter.

Salvador is the only one who gives a different sand-painting for the
boys’ ceremony ([fig. 2](#img_fig02).md); the others think it differed only
in being of a larger size.

Salvador is probably correct. He drew both for me on pieces of paper and
explained them as well as he could. The circle in the boys’
sand-painting is about as large as a wagon wheel, and is divided in
quarters, three of which are marked off by lines into nine divisions
each; the fourth being empty except for the figure of a rattlesnake and
three round figures meaning the flat baskets, tukmul, which belong to
the men and are sacred to Chungichnish, being placed on the ground in
every ceremonial, containing a little grain.

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

The divisions of this painting are said to be in various colors, made
with powdered yellow bark, white and red clay, and other paints, yellow,
green, white, blue, and red.

This painting represents the earth, the colors symbolizing flowers,
fields, and trees.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[87:25](roli06.htm#fr_25.md) It will be seen that
these are all connected with the idea of initiation.—Ed.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[88:26](roli06.htm#fr_26.md) The design may also be
imagined as consisting of nine pointed figures of the form of a Gothic
arch, intersecting, and surrounding the central hole.—Ed.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[88:27](roli06.htm#fr_30.md) Tukomit, night, also
the first 'man' made by Kyuvish Ataxvish (x German ch); sky, tupash;
Towish, spirit, corpse, cham-towi, our spirit. Cham-kwinamo, our spirit,
root, or origin, from kwinamush, which really means root, and is used in
speaking of the root of a plant or the origin of a person.—S.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[88:28](roli06.htm#fr_31.md) To most California
Indians the Milky Way is the spirits’ or ghosts’ road.—Ed.

nawish, marking, writing, painting, from the verb nawi.
