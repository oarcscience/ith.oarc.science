### CLANS OR TRADITIONAL GROUPS.

At the present day no trace of tribal consciousness exists; but a
division can still be traced into what may be called clans; though the
little information gained is so vague in character that no definite
conclusion can be based upon it.

The interpreter thus tries to explain the division into these parties or
clans. José's uncle has one name, and José's father has another; but the
latter and others belong to the uncle's "party." They do not have to be
related, but anyone can join the party who wants to. It is like church
membership, he says,

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

or like Masons and Oddfellows. Some chiefs did not have many ceremonial
objects, and did not perform any ceremonies: but to José's uncle
descended the hereditary performance of Mani, the toloache ceremony. In
earliest times the family name was Naxyum. Now they are called Calac.
When they scattered from Temecula, the Naxyum family brought their
tamyush, toloache bowls, with them, and the other families did not bring
any, or not many; and they brought the fire songs to put out the fire in
the toloache ceremony: and they brought an eagle with them; rind as they
came along they put him in one of the cañons, and he is still there.
They used to catch the young ones in this place for the ceremony. The
Naxyum were a big family of brothers. They were all related. After they
had found there was to be death, at the death of Ouiot, the Naxyum took
the tamyush, while others did not take anything. They would sing the
songs of Munival to tell how they traveled from Temecula to Rincon,
where they now live as the Calacs.

The people from Temecula called themselves Exvayum. <span
id="fr_311"></span>[295](#fn_305.md) Temecula was ruined after Ouiot died,
so they scattered in groups. The Diegueños went off with a separate
language when they left Temecula.

The groups were originally related, but they kept changing names, so
that they have not the same names now, but have the same ancestors.

The songs show who are related. Only those of the same group can sing
the same songs. José's father's traveling songs are different from
Lucario's. The songs descended from father to son and the old people
were eager to teach the songs to those in the same family, but not to
outsiders. But if an old man is the last of his line, like Lucario, it
is then permissible for him to leave his songs to another in a different
"party."

When Albañas was a boy, his father was killed, and his mother died soon
after. He was brought up by a circle of old people, each of Whom in turn
instructed him in the family songs.

Some of the chiefs had very few ceremonies, did not know much. Only the
most important ones could lead the ceremonies.
