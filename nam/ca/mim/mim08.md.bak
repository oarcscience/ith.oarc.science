# 6. THE FLOOD

Prairie Falcon told his people to prepare. He said, "Get ready, Eagle.
Get ready, Flicker. Get ready, Dove. Get ready, Woodpecker. Get ready,
Quail. Get ready, Kingbird. Get ready, Hummingbird. We are going. We are
going. We are going, going toward the north. Hurry, prepare, for we must
go at once, must go at once, must go at once." Thus he spoke, when he
told his people to prepare. "We shall take the people. We shall take the
people to the place, where my father always goes."

Prairie Falcon said to Eagle, "Tell everyone, Eagle. Tell everyone,
Eagle. Have your people prepare. Tell California Jay to come. Tell
Coyote to come. Tell Hummingbird to come. We will go to the top of the
great mountain."

Eagle said, "We shall follow our chief to the great mountain. We will go
there, so that we may see how the world fares. I hear that a flood
approaches. We are all going together. Do not say 'I shall stay home.'
We are all going. Do not say 'I am sick.' Do not be lazy. We are all
going, going toward the north. We will arrive there. We will see
different sorts of people." Thus spoke the chief, when he told his
people to prepare.

Prairie Falcon said, "We are all going. Do not stay behind. Take Chief
Eagle for a guide. He knows the way. Hurry, the water comes. Do not stay
at home, for you will drown. We are all going. We will try to escape
from the flood." Thus spoke Prairie Falcon to Eagle. He continued to
Eagle, "I do not think that the water will cover the great mountain. If
we arrive there before it overtakes us, I think we shall be saved."

They hurried. "The water is just coming over the cliff." said Coyote to
Chief Prairie Falcon. Coyote saw the water coming over the bluff.
Flicker became frightened and fainted. They called Hummingbird to save
Flicker's life.

Coyote said, "I am the only one who will drown, as I cannot run fast
enough. One of my legs is cut off." They all went, except Coyote. He
could not walk. He stayed on a big log as the water neared him. The
water reached him and he floated with the log. Meanwhile, the people
gained the mountain top. The water overwhelmed everything, making great
caverns in the mountains. Coyote on his log drifted hither and thither
and finally stranded in a different country. The water subsided after
drowning all human beings.

Eagle said to Rattlesnake, "The flood washed us to this mountain top."
Rattlesnake repeated this to his wife, saying, "The water washed those
people to our mountain."

The water rose a second time. It rose higher than ever, and it washed
down the great mountain where the Rattlesnakes lived. Eagle sent Dove
into the air to survey the water for another mountain, where they might
take refuge. Then he sent Hummingbird on a similar quest. Hummingbird
found dry land, returned, and told Prairie Falcon.

"Hurry, let us go before the water overtakes us," said Prairie Falcon to
his people, "for the water still rises." They went, taking Rattlesnake
with them. On the way Rattlesnake bit Flicker, who was carrying him.
They dropped Rattlesnake in the water, and he had to swim. He swam back
to his home, which the water had not quite

covered. After he arrived there, the water rose higher and completely
covered the mountain. Rattlesnake was forced to swim again, but as he
could not find land, he became exhausted and was drowned.

Water flooded the entire world. At last Prairie Falcon and Eagle and
their people arrived at a piece of dry land. There they found green
fruit. Hummingbird told them not to eat the fruit. Then they sent Dove
to survey the water and discover how humanity fared. Dove reported that
all human beings were dead.

Prairie Falcon and his people were starving upon their piece of dry
land. Prairie Falcon again sent forth Dove and Hummingbird with orders
to bring back some earth. He told them to obtain mud. He instructed
Hummingbird not to suck the flowers and Dove not to eat the weed seed.
"Do not forget to bring mud," he said, "Do not eat the weed seed and do
not suck the flowers." The water had subsided. Prairie Falcon said, when
he sent Dove and Hummingbird, "Do not forget to bring mud. Do not forget
to bring mud." Thus he spoke to Dove and Hummingbird. Then the two went
to obtain mud. This occurred after all human beings were dead, after
they had been drowned and after the great mountains had been changed.
Then Dove and Hummingbird went.
