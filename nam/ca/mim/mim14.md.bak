# STORIES BY WILLIAM FULLER

## 12. THE THEFT OF FIRE

Lizard saw the smoke. He said: "Smoking below, smoking below, smoking
below, smoking below. My grandmother starts a fire to cook acorns. It is
very lonely."

Flute-player (Mouse) was sent down the mountains into the valley to
secure the fire. Flute-player departed, taking with him two flutes. He
finally arrived at the assembly house from which the smoke was issuing.
He found it crowded, but he was welcomed and the people persuaded him to
play. He played and he played.

Then they put a feather mat over the smoke hole at the top of the house
and shut the feathers in the door. They closed the door with the feather
dress. They told the doorkeeper to close the door tight.

Flute-man played continuously. The people fell asleep and snored.
Flute-player remained awake and played. Finally, he concluded that all
were fast asleep. He arose and took two coals from the fire, placing
them in his flute. Then he put two coals in the second flute. He
proceeded to the door, cut loose the feathers, passed out, and started
homeward.

The people awoke to find him gone and with him the fire. Hail and Rain
were sent in pursuit, for they were the two swiftest travellers among
the valley people. Hail went, but Flute-man heard Hail and Rain coming,
so he threw one of his flutes under a buckeye tree. Rain asked him what
he had done with the fire. "You stole our fire," Rain said. Flute-player
denied it. Then Rain returned home. The placing of the flute, with the
coals in it, under the buckeye tree resulted in the fire always being in
the buckeye.

When Rain started back, Flute-man took his fire from under the buckeye
and again proceeded homeward. He arrived at home safely and brought the
fire into the assembly house. He told the people that Rain had taken one
flute with coals in it. He said, "Rain took one flute from me. I have
only one left."

The chief told Flute-player to build a fire, and the latter produced the
coals from his remaining flute. A large fire was made. It was then that
people lost their language. Those close to the fire talked correctly.
The people at the north side of the assembly house talked brokenly.
Those at the south side talked altogether different; so did those at the
west side and at the east side. This was because of the cold.

Coyote brought entrails and threw them on the fire, extinguishing it.
The people became angry and expelled Coyote, telling him to remain
outside and to eat his food raw. That is why Coyote always eats his meat
uncooked.
