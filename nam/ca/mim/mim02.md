# INTRODUCTION

The fourteen stories presented in this collection were secured during
1913 and 1914 among the Central Sierra Miwok of Tuolumne County,
California. Three, which are exceedingly brief, were told by William
Fuller of Soulsbyville. The remaining eleven were obtained from Thomas
Williams of Jamestown, whose picture appears in plate 6.

All are sentence-by-sentence translations into English of myths which
were recorded in Miwok on the phonograph.

These stories were formerly related at night in the Circular assembly
houses of the Miwok. Certain men versed in the myths often

travelled from village to village telling the tales in the assembly
house of each village. Such a raconteur was known as an utentbe, a name
derived from utne, a myth. Each utentbe was paid for his services, his
audience presenting him with baskets, beads, furs, and food. Thomas
Williams, who was formerly an utentbe, said that the telling of a myth
often took all night. Not infrequently the myth was chanted. Each myth,
whether chanted or told in ordinary prose, was accompanied by the songs
of the various characters. For example, with the story of Prairie
Falcon's Marriage belong three songs, one sung by Prairie Falcon, one by
his wife, and one by his father.

A comprehensive collection of Miwok myths, including a number from the
Central Sierra Miwok, has been published by Dr. C. Hart Merriam. <span

his "Tribes of California." <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) Dr. A. L.
