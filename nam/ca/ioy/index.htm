<P>This short little book was written by one of the pioneers of
Yosemite National Park, Galen Clark. 
In 1857 Clark was the first white person to view the Mariposa Grove, a stand
of old-growth redwoods which are some of the largest living organisms
on the planet.
Clark was one of the first full-time white residents of Yosemite and
is considered the first ranger of that park.
Although obviously Clark had no training in ethnography, he lived
for many years with the last generation of
pre-contact Native Americans of Yosemite.
It is apparent that the Yosemite Miwok, who had a disasterous first contact,
were extremely reluctant to open up about the details of their mythology
and culture, even to comparatively benign individuals such as Clark.
However, this is one of the few first-hand accounts from this period,
and the information in this book has been rehashed in many others,
such as <A HREF="../lly/index.htm">The Lore and Lure of the Yosemite</A>.
