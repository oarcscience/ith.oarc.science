### HINTS TO YOSEMITE VISITORS.

This chapter is included in this etext for completeness. Of course, the
vast majority of this quaint tourist information, originally published
in 1904, (except for the geographical and etymological facts) is a
century out of date. The advice to "TAKE YOUR CAMERA" is timeless,
though.--J. B. Hare.

Secure stage seats in advance.

Take only hand baggage, unless for a protracted visit. For a short trip,
an outing suit and two or three waists, with a change for evening wear,
will be found sufficient. The free baggage allowance on the stage lines
is fifty pounds.

Men will find flannel or negligee shirts the most comfortable.

In April, May and June wear warm clothing and take heavy wraps. In July,
August and September wear medium clothing, with light wraps. In October
and November wear warm clothing, with heavy wraps. The nights are cool
at all seasons.

Dusters are always advisable, and ladies should provide some light head
covering to protect the hair from dust. Sun bonnets are frequently worn.

Short skirts are most convenient.

Divided skirts are proper for trail trips, as ladies are required to
ride astride. Heavy

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

denim for skirt and bloomers is very satisfactory. Such skirts can be
hired in the Valley.

Waists of soft material and neutral shades are appropriate. Avoid white.

Something absolutely soft for neckwear will be found a great comfort,
both by men and women.

Leggings, stout, comfortable shoes and heavy, loose gloves will be found
very serviceable.

A soft felt hat is preferable to straw. One that will shade the eyes is
best. A cloth traveling cap is the worst thing to wear.

Smoked glasses will sometimes save the wearer a headache.

Except in April, May and November, an umbrella is a useless encumbrance.

If the skin is sensitive, and one wishes to avoid a painful sunburn, the
use of a pure cream and soft cloth is preferable to water, and far more
efficacious.

A week is the shortest time that should be allowed for a trip to
Yosemite. Two weeks are better. The grandeur of the Valley cannot be
fully appreciated in a few weeks.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

Those not accustomed to staging or mountain climbing should make some
allowance in their itineraries for rest. Many visitors spoil their visit
by getting too tired.

Take a little more money than you think will be needed. You may wish to
prolong your stay.

Hunting, or possession of firearms, is not permitted in the Yosemite
National Park. Fishing is allowed, and in June and July an expert angler
is likely to be well rewarded. Rods and tackle may be hired in the
Valley.

There is no hardship, risk or danger in any part of the Yosemite trip.
Many old people and children visit the Valley without difficulty.

A knowledge of horsemanship is not needed for going on the trail. The
most timid people make the trips with enjoyment. Some of the finest
views can only be obtained in this way.

There is a laundry in the Valley.

There is a barber shop.

There is a post office, telegraph, and express.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

There is a general store and places for the sale of photographs, curios
and Indian work.

Treat the Indians with courtesy and consideration, if you expect similar
treatment from them. Do not expect them to pose for you for nothing.
They are asked to do it hundreds of times every summer, and are entitled
to payment for their trouble.

Kodak films and plates can be obtained in the Valley.

Developing and printing are done in the Valley.

TAKE YOUR CAMERA.

### INTERPRETATION OF INDIAN NAMES

The Indians had names for all the prominent features of the Yosemite
Valley, and these have been variously translated (sometimes with
considerable poetic license), and variously spelled. The translations
given below are as literal as possible, without embellishment, and are
believed to be fairly accurate. The spelling adopted is such as best
indicates the pronunciation.

The English names, by which the falls and peaks are commonly known, bear
no relation to the Indian names, but were bestowed by

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

the soldiers of the Mariposa Battalion at the time the Valley was
discovered. The appropriateness and good taste of most of them are due
to Dr. L. H. Bunnell, the surgeon of the expedition.

AH-WAH'-NEE (original name of Yosemite Valley)--"Deep grassy valley."

YO-SEM'-I-TE--"Full-grown grizzly bear."

PO-HO'-NO (Bridal Veil)--"A puffing wind."

LOI'-YA (The Sentinel)--"A signal station."

CHO'-LACK (Yosemite Falls)--"The falls."

CHO-KO'-NI (Royal Arches)--"Canopy of baby basket." Strictly speaking
this name applies only to a deep alcove near the top of this cliff.

YO-WEI'-YEE (Nevada)--"Twisting."

TO-TAU-KON-NU'-LA (El Capitan)--Named from the To-tau'-kons, or cranes,
which used to make their nests in a meadow near the top of this rock.

KU-SO'-KO (Cathedral Rock)--Interpretation doubtful.

PU-SEE'-NA CHUCK'-AH (Cathedral Spires)--"Pu-see-na" means mouse or rat,
and might possibly be applied to a squirrel. "Chuck-ah" is a store house
or cache.

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

WAW-HAW'-KEE (Three Brothers)--"Falling rocks." Pom-pom-pa'-sus, usually
given as the Indian name of the Three Brothers, is the name of a smaller
rock immediately to the West.

WEI-YOW' (Mt. Watkins)--"Juniper Mountain."

TO-KO'-YA (North Dome)--"The basket."

TIS-SA'ACK (Half Dome)--A character in Indian mythology.

MAH'-TA (Cap of Liberty)--Said to mean "Martyr Mountain."

PI-WEI'-ACK (Vernal Fall)--Said to mean "Sparkling Water."

LE-HAM'-I-TEE (Indian Canyon)--"The place of the arrow-wood."

HUM-MO' (Devil's Thumb)--"The Lost Arrow."

AH-WEI'-YA (Mirror Lake)--"Quiet Water."

TOO-LOO'-LO-WEI-ACK (Illillouette Fall)--Interpretation doubtful.

WAH'-WO-NAH--"Big Tree." (Now commonly spelled and pronounced
Wa-wo'-na.)
