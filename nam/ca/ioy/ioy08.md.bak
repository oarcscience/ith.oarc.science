# Chapter Five

### RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES AND BELIEFS

The Indians of this region, in common with most, if not all, of the
North American aborigines, were of a highly religious temperament, most
devout in their beliefs and observances, and easily wrought upon by the
priests or medicine men of their tribes. Elaborate ceremonies were
carried out, in which all of the details were highly symbolical, and
some of their curious and picturesque superstitions were responsible for
acts of cruelty and vengeance, which in many cases were foreign to their
natural disposition.

### DANCES.

Dancing was an important part of all religious observances, and was
practiced purely as a ceremonial, and never for pleasure or recreation.
Both men and women took part, the men executing a peculiar shuffling
step which involved a great deal of stamping upon the ground with their
bare

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

feet, and the women performing a curious, sideways, swaying motion. Some
of the dancers carried wands or arrows, and indulged in wild
gesticulations. They usually circled slowly around a fire, and danced to
the point of exhaustion, when others would immediately take their
places. The ceremony was accompanied by the beating of rude drums, and
by a monotonous chant, which was joined in by all the dancers.

The great occasions for dancing were before going to war, and when
cremating the bodies of their dead. The war dance was probably the most
elaborate in costume and other details, and of recent years the Indians
have sometimes given public exhibitions of what purported to be war
dances, but these performances, like everything else which they do from
purely mercenary motives, are very poor imitations of the originals, and
it is doubtful if they have ever allowed a genuine war dance to be
witnessed by white men.

### FESTIVALS.

The various tribes in the vicinity of Yosemite Valley are accustomed to
hold a

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

great meeting or festival once a year, each tribe taking its turn as
hosts, and the others sometimes coming from considerable distances. At
these meetings there are dances and other ceremonials, and also a grand
feast, for which extensive preparations are made. Another feature of the
occasion is the presentation of gifts to the visiting tribes, consisting
of money, blankets, clothing, baskets, bead-work, or other valuable
articles. These presents, or their equivalent, no matter how small they
may be, are always returned to the givers at the next annual festival,
together with additional gifts, which, in turn, must be given back the
following year, and so on.

At these gatherings an Indian is appointed to secure and keep on hand a
good supply of wood for the camp fires, and every day he spreads a
blanket on the ground and sits on it, and the other Indians throw Money,
clothing, or other contributions, into the blanket, to pay him and his
assistants for their services. At other times this man acts as a
messenger or news carrier--first spreading his blanket to collect

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

his fees, and then starting off on his mission.

### MARRIAGE

Many of the Indians in Mariposa and adjoining counties were polygamists,
having two or three, and sometimes more, wives. Some of the chiefs and
head men would have wives from several of the adjacent tribes, which had
a tendency to establish permanent friendly relations among them.

Every man who took a young woman for his wife had to buy her. Young
women were considered by their parents as personal chattels, subject to
sale to the highest suitable bidder, and the payment of the price
constituted the main part of the marriage ceremony. The wife was then
the personal property of the husband, which he might sell or gamble away
if he wished; but such instances were said to be very rare. In case
negotiations for a marriage fell through, the preliminary payments were
scrupulously returned to the rejected suitor by the parents.

Even a widow, independent of control in the matter of marriage, if she
consented to

become a man's wife, received some compensation herself from her
intended husband.

It is said that in their marital relations they were as a rule strictly
faithful to each other. If the woman was found to be guilty of
unfaithfulness to her husband, the penalty was death. Such a thing as a
man whipping or beating his wife was never known. Whipping under any
circumstances was considered a more humiliating and disgraceful
punishment than death.

Even in the management of children, whipping was never resorted to as
punishment for disobedience. In fact, children were always treated in
such a kind, patient, loving manner, that disobedience was a fault
rarely known. The pre-natal maternal influence, and subsequent treatment
after birth, were such that they were naturally patient and readily
submissive to kind parental control.

In recent years, under the influence and examples often seen in what is
called civilized life, Indian husbands have been known to beat their
wives, and mothers to whip their children.

### MEDICINE MEN.

At the time of the settlement of California by the whites, every Indian
tribe had its professional doctors or medicine men, who also acted as
religious leaders. They were the confidential counselors of the chiefs
and head-men of the tribes, and had great influence and control over the
people. They claimed to be spiritual mediums, and to have communication
with the departed spirits of some of their old and most revered
chieftains and dear friends, now in a much more happy condition than
when here in earthly life. They were thought to be endowed with
supernatural powers, not only in curing all diseases (except those due
to old age), but also in making a well person sick at their pleasure,
even at a distance; but when their sorcery failed to work on their white
enemies and exterminate them, they lost the confidence of their
followers to a large extent.

With the invasion of the white settlers came forced changes in their old
customs and manner of living, and a new variety of epidemic and other
diseases. When a doctor failed to cure these diseases, and several

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

deaths occurred in quick succession in a camp, they believed the doctor
was under the control of some evil spirit, and killed him.

After the Indians were given their freedom from the reservations in
1855, the old ones, subdued and broken-hearted, sickened and died very
fast, and most of the men doctors were killed off in a few years. There
are none known who now attempt to act in that capacity.

There are still some women doctors who continue to practice the magic
art, but as there are now but very few Indians, there is not so much
sickness, and very few deaths in a year, so that the doctors very rarely
forfeit their lives by many of their patients dying in quick succession.

Their most common mode of treatment in cases of sickness was to scarify
the painful locality with the sharp edge of a piece of obsidian, and
suck out the blood with the mouth. In cases of headache, the forehead
was operated on; in a case of colic the abdomen was treated in the same
way, as were also all painful swellings on any part of the body.

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

The grand object of the doctor was to make the patient and family firmly
believe that his course of treatment was removing the cause of the
sickness. To aid in strengthening this belief, after diagnosing the
case, and before commencing operations, he would quietly retire for a
short time, ostensibly to get under the influence of the divine healing
spirit, but in reality to fill his mouth with several small articles,
such as bits of wood or stone; he was then ready to commence treatment.
After sucking and spitting pure blood a few times, he began to spit out
with the blood, one after another, the things he had in his mouth, at
the sight of which all the attendants would join in a chorus of grunts
of astonishment, and the doctor would pretend to be very much
nauseated.. In most ordinary cases two or three treatments effected a
cure.

The doctors also made use of certain rare medicinal plants in treating
some diseases. The Indian women have great faith in charms made of the
pungent roots of some rare plants from the high mountain ranges, which
they wear on strings around their

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

necks, or on a string of beads, to protect them from sickness.

In cases of malignant sores or ulcers on any part of the body, the
doctors treated them by applying dirt or earth, and in warm weather
would excavate a place in the ground and put the patient in it, either
in a sitting or recumbent position, as the nature of the case required,
and cover the affected part with earth for several hours daily.
Sometimes, by this mode of treatment, wonderful cures were made.

In all cases, if a doctor failed to cure a disease, and the patient
died, he was obliged to refund to the relatives any fee which he had
received for his services.

### DISPOSING OF THE DEAD.

In the early days of the settlement of California, it seemed to be the
universal custom of the Indians along the foothills of the Sierra Nevada
range of mountains to burn the bodies of their dead.

A suitable pile of readily combustible wood was prepared. The body was
taken charge of by persons chosen to perform the last sacred rites, and
firmly bound in skins

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

or blankets, and then placed upon the funeral pyre, with all the
personal effects of the deceased, together with numerous votive
offerings from friends and relatives. The chief mourners of the occasion
seemed to take but little active part in the ceremonies. When all was
ready, one of the assistants would light the fire, and the terrible,
wailing, mournful cry would commence, and the professional chanters,
with peculiar sidling movements and frantic gestures, would circle round
and round about the burning pile. Occasionally, on arriving at the
northwest corner of the pile, they would stop, and, pointing to the
West, would end a crying refrain by exclaiming "*Him-i-la'-ya*!" When
these became exhausted, others would step in and take their places, and
thus keep up the mournful ceremony until the whole pile was consumed.

After the pile had cooled, the charred bones and ashes were gathered up,
a few pieces of bone selected, and the remainder buried. Of the pieces
retained, some would be sent to distant relatives, and the others
pounded to a fine powder, then mixed with pine pitch and plastered on
the faces of the

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

nearest female relatives as a badge of mourning, to be kept there until
it naturally wore off . Every Indian camp used to have some of these
hideous looking old women in it in the "early days."

One principal reason for burning the bodies of the dead was the belief
that there is an evil spirit, waiting and watching for the animating
spirit or soul to leave the body, that he may get it to take to his own
world of darkness and misery. By burning the perishable body they
thought that the immortal soul would be more quickly released and set
free to speed to the happy spirit world in the *El-o'-win*, or far
distant West, while with their loud, wailing cries the evil spirit was
kept away.

The young women take great care of their long, shining, black hair, of
which they all feel very proud, as adding much to their personal beauty,
and they seldom have it cut before marriage. But upon the death of a
husband the wife has her hair all cut off and burned with his body, so
that he may still have it in his future spirit home, to love and caress
as a memento of his living earth-wife.

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

These Indians believe that everything on earth, both natural and
artificial, is endowed with an immortal spirit, which is indestructible,
and that whatever personal property or precious gifts are burned, either
with the body or in later years for the departed friend's benefit, will
be received and made use of in the spirit world. In recent years the
Yosemites and other remnants of tribes closely associated with them,
have adopted the custom of the white people, and bury their dead. The
fine, expensive blankets, and most beautifully worked baskets, which
have been kept sacredly in hiding for many years, to be buried with the
owner, are now cut into small fragments before being deposited in the
ground, for fear some white person will desecrate the grave by digging
them up and carrying them away.

There are no people in the world who show more reverence for their dead,
or hold their memory more sacred, than these so-called "Digger" Indians.
After being released from the reservations they kept themselves in
abject poverty for many years, by sacrificing their best blankets,
baskets and

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

clothing in the devouring flames of a fire kindled for that purpose,
when holding their annual mourning festivals in memory of their dead
friends.

### RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.

The old Indians are all very reticent regarding their religious beliefs.
They hold them too sacred to be exposed to possible ridicule, and it is
therefore very difficult to get information from them by direct
questions.

They seem, however, to have a vague, indistinct belief or tradition that
their original ancestors, in the long forgotten past, dwelt in a better
and much more desirable country than this, in the *El-o'-win*, or
distant West, and that by some misfortune or great calamity they were
separated from that happy land, and became wanderers in this part of the
world. They also believe that the spirits of all good Indians will be
permitted, after death, to go back to that happy country of their
ancestors' origin; but that the spirits of bad Indians have to serve
another earth life in the form of a grizzly bear, as a punishment for
their

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

former crimes. Hence, no Indians ever eat bear meat if they know it.

All the old Indian are spiritualists, and very superstitious in their
religious beliefs. One special tenet is that if one of their relatives
or friends has been murdered, he will not receive them on terms of
friendship in the spirit world unless they revenge his death, by either
killing the murderer or some one of the same blood. This belief
sometimes results in an entirely innocent person being put to death.

They all have a great fear of evil spirits, which they believe have the
power to do them much harm and defeat their undertakings. They also have
a fairly distinct idea of a Deity or Great Spirit, who never does them
any harm, and whose home is in the happy land of their ancestors in the
West.
