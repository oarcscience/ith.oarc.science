# Chapter Six

### NATIVE INDUSTRIES.

The Yosemites and other kindred or adjacent tribes have been branded as
"Diggers," and are generally thought to be the lowest class of Indians
in America, but in some lines of artistic work they excelled all other
tribes. For example, their basketry work, for domestic or sacred
purposes, and their bows and arrows, were of very superior workmanship
and fine finish.

### BASKETRY AND BEAD WORK.

Many years ago the chief industry of the Indian women, aside from their
other domestic duties, was the making of baskets. They made a great
variety of shapes and sizes for their common use, and also many of a
more artistic design and finer finish for the sacred purpose of being
burned or buried with their bodies, or that of some relative or dear
friend, after death. The baskets devoted to this special purpose are the
finest made, but are very seldom seen by any white person, and are not
for sale at any

price. This finest style of work seems to have been made a specialty by
certain of the most artistic workers in each tribe.

At the present time, in their more modern style of living, they do not
require so many baskets, and the industry of making them is fast on the
decline. Some of the old women, however, still continue to make such as
are required for their own use, and a few others for sale.

Most of the ornamental figures and designs worked into the finest
basketry are symbolical in character, and of so ancient an origin that
Indians of the present day do not know what many of them are intended to
represent. They have simply been copied from time immemorial, with the
idea that they were necessary for the complete finish and beauty of the
article made.

In recent years they sometimes make use of more modern styles of
ornamentation, which they see in print.

Many of the young women are now giving their attention to making fancy
bead work, in the form of ornamental belts and hat-bands, but this is an
industry of very modern origin. Some of them are employed

by white people to do laundry and other work, and any labor of this kind
pays them better than making baskets for sale. Forty years ago a finely
made basket could have been bought for less than ten dollars. At
present, if the time spent in getting and preparing the necessary
materials, and in working them into the basket, were paid for at the
same rate per day that a young woman receives for doing washing in the
hotel laundry, or for private families, it would amount to over one
hundred dollars.

Most of the baskets made for domestic use are so closely woven that they
are practically water-tight, and are used for cooking and similar
purposes. Over on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, near
the dry, desert country, the Indians make some of their baskets in the
form of jugs of various sizes. These are smeared over with a pitch
composition, which renders them perfectly water-tight, and they are used
for carrying water when traveling over those desolate, sandy wastes.

### BOWS AND ARROWS.

The Indian men showed no less ingenuity and artistic skill in their
special lines of

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

work than the women, especially in the manufacture of their bows and
arrows, in the making of fish lines and coarser twine out of the soft,
flexible bark of the milkweed (*Asclepias speciosa*), and in making
other useful implements and utensils with the very limited means at
their disposal.

Their bows were made of a branch of the incense cedar (*Libocedrus
decurrens*), or of the California nutmeg (*Tumion Californicum*
\[*Torreya*\] ), made flat on the outer side, and rounded smooth on the
inner or concave side when the bow is strung for use. The flat, outer
side was covered with sinew, usually that from the leg of a deer,.
steeped in hot water until it became soft and glutinous, and then laid
evenly and smoothly over the wood, and so shaped at the ends as to hold
the string in place. When thoroughly dry the sinew contracted, so that
the bow when not strung was concave on the outer side.

When not in use the bow was always left unstrung. To string it for use,
it was necessary in cold weather to warm it, thus making it more elastic
and easily bent. The best

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

strings were also made of sinew, or of paxwax cartilage, for their
finest bows.

The arrows were made of reeds and various kinds of wood, including the
syringa (*Philadelphus Lewisii*) and a small shrub or tree which the
Indians called *Le-ham'-i-tee*, or arrow-wood, and which grew quite
plentifully in what is now known as Indian Canyon, near the Yosemite
Falls.

The finest arrows were furnished with points made of obsidian, or
volcanic glass, which was obtained in the vicinity of Mono Lake on the
eastern side of the Sierras. It required great care and delicate skill
to work this brittle material into the fine sharp points, and the making
of them seemed to be a special business or trade with some of the old
men. Arrows furnished with these points were only used in hunting large
game, or in hostile combat with enemies; for common use, in hunting
small game, the hard wooden arrow was merely sharpened to a point.

The butt, or end used on the string, was furnished with three or four
short strips of feathers taken from a hawk's wing, and fastened on
lengthwise. These strips of

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

feathers are supposed to aid in the more accurate flight of the arrow
when shot from the bow.

When out on a hunt the Indian carried his bow strung ready for use, and
his bundle of assorted arrows in a quiver made of the skin of a small
fox, wild-cat or fisher, hung conveniently over his shoulder.

These primitive weapons, which were in universal use by the Yosemite
Indians fifty years ago, are now never seen except in some collection of
Indian relics and curios.

Other articles manufactured by these tribes were stone hammers, and also
others made from the points of deer horns mounted on wooden handles
which they used in delicately chipping the brittle obsidian in forming
arrowheads., Rude musical instruments, principally drums and flageolets,
were also made.
