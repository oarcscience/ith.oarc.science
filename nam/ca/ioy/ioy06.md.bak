# Chapter Three.

### CUSTOMS AND CHARACTERISTICS.

As stated in a previous chapter, all of the Indian tribes occupying the
region in the vicinity of the Yosemite Valley were more or less
affiliated by blood and intermarriage, and resembled each other in their
customs, characteristics and religious beliefs. What is said, therefore,
on these subjects in the following pages, will be understood to apply
generally to all of the tribes which have been mentioned as inhabiting
this region, although, of course, minor differences did exist,
principally due to environment. As in the case of all primitive peoples,
their mode of life, food supply, etc., were largely determined by
natural conditions, and the tribes living in the warm foot-hills
differed somewhat in these respects from those dwelling higher in the
mountains.

### DIVISION OF TERRITORY.

In their original tribal settlements, at the time the first pioneer
whites came among them, the Indians had well defined or under

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

stood boundary lines, between the territories claimed by each tribe for
their exclusive use in hunting game and gathering means of support; and
any trespassing on the domain of others was likely to cause trouble.
This arrangement, however, did not apply to the higher ranges of the
Sierras, which were considered common hunting ground.

### COMMERCE AMONG THE TRIBES.

As there was a difference in the natural products and resources of
different sections of the country, there was a system of reciprocal
trade in the exchange of the different desirable commodities. Sometimes
commerce between tribes extended for a long distance, as, for instance,
the Indians on the western side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains were
entirely dependent upon the Pai-utes (*Pye-yutes'*) on the eastern side
for the obsidian, a kind of volcanic glass, from which they made the
points for their most deadly arrows, used in hunting large game or when
in mortal combat with their enemies. They were also dependent upon the
Pai-utes for their supply of salt for domestic use, which came in solid
blocks as

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

quarried from salt mines, said to be two days' travel on foot from Mono
Lake.

From the Indians at or near the Catholic Missions to the South, on the
Pacific Coast, they got their hunting knives of iron or steel. and sea
shells of various kinds, for personal or dress ornaments, and also to be
used as money. From the same source they obtained beads of various
forms, sizes and colors, cheap jewelry and other fancy articles, a few
blankets, and pieces of red bunting, strips of which the chiefs and head
men wore around their heads as badges, indicating their official
positions.

### COMMUNICATION.

They had a very efficient system of quickly spreading important news by
relays of special couriers, who took the news to the first stations or
tribes in different directions, where others took the verbal dispatches
and ran to the next station, and so on, so that all tribes within an
area of a hundred miles would get the good or bad tidings within a few
hours. In this manner important communication was kept up between the
different tribes.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

They also had well organized signal systems, by fires in the night and
smoke by day, on high points of observation-variations in the lights
(either steady, bright or flashing) indicating somewhat the character of
the tidings thus given.

### DWELLINGS.

Their winter huts, or *o'-chums*, as they termed them, were invariably
of a conical form, made with small poles, and covered with the bark of
the incense cedar (*Libocedrus decurrens*). A few poles ten or twelve
feet long were set in the ground around an area of about twelve feet in
diameter, with their -tops inclined together. The outside was then
closely covered with long strips of the cedar bark, making it perfectly
watertight. An opening was left on the south side for an entrance, which
could be readily closed with a portable door. An opening was also left
at the top for the escape of the smoke, a fire being kindled in the
center inside.

One of these huts would hold a family of a half-dozen persons, with all
their household property, dogs included; and there is

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

no other form of a single-room dwelling that can be kept warm and
comfortable in cold weather with so little fire, as this Indian
*o'-chum*.

Their under-bedding usually consisted of the skins of bears, deer,
antelope or elk, and the top covering was a blanket or robe made of the
skins of small fur-bearing animals, such as rabbits, hares, wildcats and
foxes. The skins were cut in narrow strips, which were loosely twisted
so as to bring the fur entirely around on the outside, and then woven
into a warp of strong twine made of the fine, tough, fibrous bark of a
variety of milkweed (*Asclepias speciosa*). These fur robes were very
warm, and were also used as wraps when traveling in cold weather.

During the warm summer season they generally lived outside in brush
arbors, and used their *o'-chums* as storage places.

### CLOTHING.

Their clothing was very simple and scant, before being initiated into
the use of -a more ample and complete style of covering while living at
the reservations. The ordinary full complement of dress for a man
(*Nung'-ah*)

was simply a breech-clout, or short hip-skirt made of skins; that for a
woman (*O'-hoh*) was a skirt reaching from the waist to the knees, made
of dressed deer-skin finished at the bottom with a slit fringe, and
sometimes decorated with various fancy ornaments. Both men and women
frequently wore moccasins made of dressed deer or elk skin. Young
children generally went entirely nude.

### CHARACTERISTICS.

The Indians of the various tribes in this part of the Sierras vary
somewhat in physical characteristics, but in general are of medium
height, strong, lean and agile, and the men are usually fine specimens
of manhood. They are rather light in color, but frequently rub their
bodies with some kind of oil, which gives the flesh a much redder and
more glossy appearance. The hair is black and straight, and the eyes are
black and deep set. The beard is sparse, and in former times was not
allowed to grow at all, each hair being pulled out with a rude kind of
tweezers. They are naturally of a gentle and friendly disposition, but
their

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

experience with the white race has made them distant and uncommunicative
to strangers.

Most of the older Indians still cling to their old customs and manner of
living, and are very slow to learn or talk our language, but the younger
ones are striving to live like the white people, and seem proud to adopt
our style of dress and manner of cooking. They all speak our language
plainly, and some few of them attend the public schools when living near
by, and acquire very readily the common rudiments of an education.

Their style of architecture is in a state of transition, like
themselves. Their old *o'-chum* form of dwelling is now very seldom
seen--a rude building of more roomy and modern design having taken its
place.

All the able-bodied men are ready and willing to work at any kind of
common labor, when they have an opportunity, and have learned to want
nearly the same amount of pay as a white man for the same work.

As a rule, they are trustworthy, and when confidence is placed in their
honesty it is very rarely betrayed. During nearly the

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

past fifty years, a great many thousands of people have visited the
Yosemite Valley with their own camping outfits, and, during the day, and
often all night, are absent on distant trips of observation, with no one
left in charge of camp, yet there has never to my knowledge been an
instance of anything being stolen or molested by Indians. There are,
however, some dishonest Indians, who will steal from their own people,
and some times, when a long distance from their own camp, they may steal
from the whites. A few, if they can get whisky, through the aid of some
white person, will become drunk and fight among themselves, and
occasionally one of them may be killed; but, as a rule, they are
peaceful and orderly, and hold sacred the promise made to the Indian
Commissioners by the old tribal chiefs, when released from confinement
on the reservations, that they would forever keep the peace, and never
again make war against the white people.
