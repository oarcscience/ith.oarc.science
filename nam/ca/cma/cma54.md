### VALUE OF LETTERS IN THE LIST OF PLACES AND IN THE NAMES OF PERSONS THROUGHOUT THE VOLUME

|                    |                    |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Along =a in hate   | I short = i in bit |
| A short = o " not  | O long = o " note  |
| Ai = i " bite      | O short = o " not  |
| Au = ow " now      | U long = oo " boot |
| E long = ai " bait | U short = u " bull |
| E short = e " bet  | J = our j          |
| I long = ee " beet | H = German ch      |

All other consonants have the same value as ours.

All short vowels are marked with macron; the long are unmarked.

When the Indian meaning of names is known, I have given it before the
present name of the place given by white men. When the name given by
white men stands alone, it indicates that the Indian meaning is
uncertain or unknown.

Names accented on the penult have no accents printed on them all others
have printed accents.
