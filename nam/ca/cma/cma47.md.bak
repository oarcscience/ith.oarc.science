### TITINDI MAUPA AND PAIOWA THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER OF WAKARA

Paiowa is the evening star. Wakara's most interesting daughters are
always Halaia, or Halai Auna, and Paiowa. The first is the morning, the
second the evening star.

Halaia's sister, Pahnino, in this myth became afterward a shell, or
rather a creature which lives in a shell, as did also her mother. I do
not know which kind of shell Pahnino is; it has bright colors.

The increase and decrease of food, the magic power of weapons, the
jealousy and hostility of the husbands of other sisters, are usual in
Yana myths of this kind.
