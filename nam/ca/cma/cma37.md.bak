*Creation Myths of Primitive America*, by Jeremiah Curtin, \[1898\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following four spirit songs are from my Wintu collection. Two I give
in the original, with literal translation; the other two, in translation
only. The lightning song, by referring to the connection between
lightning and the sucker, which has one of the most formidable spirits,
enables us to suspect why the sucker is so much feared by Wintus. In the
Olelbis song, the great one above is the cloud-compeller, as in classic
mythology. The tanning is described in "Olelbis." In the Hau song, the
celestial Hau is described as travelling along the Milky Way. This is
the Wintu comment on the text. Many readers will agree, I think, that
the Polar Star song, the fourth, is composed on a scale truly immense.
The lightning song sounds wonderfully like an extract from the Sanscrit,
"Rig Veda."

### SONGS OF SPIRITS.

1\. Walokin tsawi, Lightning's Song.

Mínom tóror wéril chirchákum sáia  
Dúne wérem winwar dún bohémum.

I bear the sucker-torch to the western tree-ridge.  
Look at me first born (and) greatest.

2\. Olelben tsawi, the Song of Olelbis.

Olél bohéma ni tsulúli káhum síka ni.

I am great above. I tan the black cloud (there).

3\. Song of Hau (red fox).

"On the stone ridge east I go.  
 On the white road I, Hau, crouching go.  
I, Hau, whistle on the road of stars."

4\. Song of Waida Werris (the Polar Star).

"The circuit of earth which you see,  
The scattering of stars in the sky which you see,  
All that is the place for my-hair." <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_4"></span>[516:1](cma37.htm#fr_4.md) Hair in Indian mythology,
as in other mythologies, is the equivalent of rays of light when
connected with the sun and with planet luminaries.
