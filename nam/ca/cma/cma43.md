### TIRUKALA

I HAVE referred to Tirukala in the Wintu myth "Hawt." The battle
described in this myth and the child which rises from the spittle of
Burnt Face and reaches maturity in one day, are very striking.

Tirukala gives the active, the working side of water as a personage, the
widener of valleys, the pusher apart of mountains, the maker of all
streams and rivers. Tirukala works without ceasing, he sings as he
labors, and never eats food of any kind.

Hawt (in the Wintu myth) gives the artistic, the poetic side of the same
person, whose voice is that of Niagara and the raging ocean at its
loudest, that of the tiniest rivulet or of the raindrop at its gentlest.
