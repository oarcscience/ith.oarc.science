AMONG the Iroquois the cyclone was represented as a great head, the name
of which in Seneca is Dagwa Noenyent. This head would pass through a
forest and tear up the greatest trees by the roots.

might remind one of the way of cooking oysters at the waterside in
Virginia near the places where they are taken.
