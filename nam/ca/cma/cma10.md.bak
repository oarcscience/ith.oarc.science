\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In Puidal Winnem lived Kele. Olelbis built a great sweat-house there,
and told him to stay in it. Kele was old and lived all alone in that
place; lived there a long time, thinking, making up his mind what to
do,--he was lonely and thirsty. "Why did Olelbis put me here?" thought
he.

Once he rose about daybreak, hurried out, went westward, went to a
creek. A great clump of mountain maples stood near the bank. Kele saw a
straight stick among all the others. He cut the stick, drew it out, and
took off a short piece. On the way home he split the stick, smoothed it,
and fixed it as he walked. He put the two sticks overhead in the
sweat-house, went out a second time. found a white oak sapling, firm and
strong, cut a piece two feet long from it, put it at the hearth. The
next day he lay with his back to the fire, lay there all night without
sleeping. Just before daybreak he heard steps, and was struck on the
back.

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> A minute later he
was struck again in the same place. The old man rose then and made a
good fire of manzanita wood.

It was daylight, and Kele said: "My children, come to the fire, warm
yourselves, sweat, and then swim in the creek."

Two girls came to the fire, warmed themselves standing, and soon they
were sweating from heat.

"My daughters," said Kele, "there is a creek near here. Go and swim in
it."

These girls were from the stick that Kele had split in two parts and put
in the house wall. The girls bathed in the creek, came back, and were
good-looking. When they came in, Kele brought venison for his two
daughters to eat.

"My daughters," said the old man, "I will tell you something. You must
go to work, do good things. There are roots in the woods all around us,
roots fit for food. You need to walk. Go out and get roots." They went
out to dig wild lily roots. After that they went every morning.

Soon they began to say: "We should like to have other food; we should
like to have game to eat. We saw mountain quail to-day; we saw deer." At
last they talked this way every night. Kele listened, thinking what to
do. These girls had a nice bed made of skins, and they talked every
night to each other; but one night they went to bed early and fell
asleep right away. Kele had wished them to sleep; that is why they fell
asleep quickly. He hurried down to some mountain-ash trees, went to the
middle of them, and cut off five sticks. He

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

whittled these, made them smooth, cut each in two. He had ten smooth
sticks then. Next he cut five other sticks. These he left rough; cut
them also in two; had ten of them. Kele placed the twenty sticks
overhead in the house on the north side, and lay with his back to the
fire. The fire was a good one, a hot manzanita fire. His club of green
oak was there at the fireplace.

Kele lay without sleeping and waited. He was awake and was thinking. The
two girls were sound asleep all the time. just before daybreak he heard
a sound as if some barefooted person had sprung from above to the floor.
Next moment some one took the club and struck him. Another came down in
the same way and struck him. Ten times he was struck with the club.

The ten smooth sticks had turned into people. Each man gave him a blow,
went to the wall of the house, and sat there. Kele did not rise yet. He
heard some one barefoot jump down and seize the club. This one hit Kele
once. A second one sprang down and hit him twice, a third three times, a
fourth four times, and so on to the tenth, who struck him ten times.
There were twenty in all; ten from the smooth and ten from the rough
sticks.

The first ten sticks he had whittled smooth, and they made ten good
sons, but from the ten untrimmed sticks came ten rough, uproarious sons.
Kele hadn't smoothed them, and they struck him many times. When the
tenth rough son struck him the last blow, Kele stood up and made a big

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

fire; he could barely move, he had been so beaten with the club. He lay
down then and said,--

"Now, my boys, come here; warm yourselves, dance and sweat, then go to
the creek to swim, and come here again." He sang then, and made his sons
dance. The boys danced, and hurried to the creek to swim, shouting as
they went. They came back to the sweat-house good-looking persons.

The two girls rose now. They knew already what their father had done.

"Go, my daughters, and cook for your brothers," said Kele.

The two sisters made the food ready and placed it before their brothers.

"Now, my sons, eat what we have," said Kele. "You will go out after
that, you will hunt, and bring game."

The first ten, the smooth men, had good sense; the second ten were
inferior; the ninth and tenth of the second ten were very bad. The first
ten took each only one mouthful; of the second ten, the first took one
mouthful, the second two, the third three, and so on to the tenth, who
took ten mouthfuls. After that they sat back and made ready to go out.

"What are we to do?" asked the first ten. We have nothing to hunt with."

Kele brought out bows and quivers with arrows, and gave them to each;
gave five ropes to them also, ropes of grass fibre. "You are armed now,"
said Kele; and he showed them where to set snares for deer.

They went far down to the foot of the mountain

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

and set snares. The ten smooth brothers stood on the mountain top; the
second ten, who were rough, drove the deer. "You must shout so that we
can hear you all the time," said the smooth brothers. Toward evening the
smooth brothers saw deer in the snares. The smooth ten took the bodies,
the best of the game; the rough ten the legs, ears, horns, all the poor
parts. The smooth ten took the best meat to the house; the rough ten
made a great uproar--they had little sense. The two sisters cooked roots
and venison for all.

Next morning Kele made a big fire of manzanita, wood. "Be up, my boys,"
called he. "Go and swim." That day the twenty stayed at home, and the
sisters went for roots.

They lived this way a long time, the brothers hunting, the sisters
digging roots and cooking, till at last the sisters wished to see other
persons besides their brothers. One day when they went for roots they
sat down on the mountain slope. "What are we to do?" said one sister;
"we wish to see people, we see no one now but our brothers and father."

That evening, when all had lain down, the elder sister went to Kele and
sat near him. "My father," said she, "I wish to know my name."

"Your name is Klereu Lulimet," said Kele; "your sister's name is Pili
Lulimet."

She told her sister what their names were. Both liked the names, and
were glad to have them. Every day the men sweated and swam, killed deer
and snared them. The sisters dug lily roots and cooked them.

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

One time instead of digging roots they went high on the mountain side
and sat there, sat looking westward. They could see very far, and things
seemed right there before them, though away off near the edge of the
great western water.

This was the first time that the sisters had a chance to see far. Till
that day they had only a mountain slope or a forest opening in front of
them; now they had the whole country to look at. just after midday they
saw a man going northward, going slowly.

"What a nice man that is! Look at him," said one sister to the other.

He stopped all at once, seemed to sit down and disappear through the
earth. That day they saw him no more.

"Oh, we should like to see that man," said the sisters, "and talk to
him." They watched, talked, and forgot to dig roots. At last, a short
time before sunset, they said, "Let us go for roots!" They ran down the
mountain, dug a basketful quickly, and hurried home.

"Oh, father, will you teach us how to sing?" said the younger sister to
Kele that evening. "We tried all day to sing. I tried to teach my
sister, she tried to teach me. We could do nothing."

"You can sing this way," said Kele, and he began,--

"O wi, no á, O wi, no í,  
 O wi, no á, O wi, no í"

That is good," said she, going away. She said nothing to her sister and
lay down.

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

Soon after the twenty brothers came. Ten of them made a great noise. The
house just trembled and shook from the uproar. The second ten had
smeared themselves with deer blood, hung deer entrails around their
necks. They looked wild and ferocious. When inside, they were quiet; in
going out and coming in they always rushed and shouted.

Next morning Kele kept the twenty brothers in the sweat-house. "Rest a
day," said he.

The sisters went to the mountain top and looked westward. Soon they saw
some one go toward the north, as on the first day.

"Did our father tell you how to sing?" asked the elder sister.

"He did, but I have forgotten."

She tried to remember the song, and soon after it came to her,--

"O wi, no á, O wi, no í,  
 O wi, no á, O wi, no í"

"This is the way our father sang," said she. "You try it, sister."

The elder began; soon both sang together.

"Oh, we have a nice song now," said they.

Their song went straight to where the man was, a long distance. This man
was Sedit. He was getting red earth for acorn bread. Water soaked
through red earth was used to moisten acorn meal. Sedit was covered with
shells. He was very splendid to look at. As he dug the earth, it seemed
to him that he heard something. He stopped, listened, listened with all
his ears. The sisters stopped singing, and he dug again; again he heard
the

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

singing and stopped. When he stopped, the sisters ceased to sing; when
he dug, they began again. Thus it continued the whole afternoon. They
kept Sedit all day there doing little, almost nothing.

Sometime before sunset the sisters dug their roots and went home. Sedit
went home too. He lived at the house of Satok Pokaila.

"What were you doing? I waited all day, forenoon and afternoon, for you.
It is too late to make bread now," said Satok.

This old woman lived alone till Sedit in his wanderings came to her and
worked, brought wood, and dug red earth for her.

"I got a headache," said he, "and had to lie down all day nearly."

"I am sorry," said the old woman; and she gave him food, but he did not
want any. Next day Sedit went for red earth. He did not eat much that
morning. He had not slept all the night. He was thinking of that song on
the mountain.

That day the sisters went to the mountain top, looked westward. Soon
Sedit came to the same place and worked, put two or three handfuls in
his basket, heard singing, heard it plainly, stopped, strained his eyes
to see who was singing, saw no one. Again he dug, again they sang; again
he stopped work, again they ceased singing; again he worked, again they
sang. Sedit thinks now how to follow the singers, tries to whistle their
music--cannot catch it--looks around, sees no one. "Well, I must sing,"
says he. He sings, and this time he catches the music.

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

The sisters sang now in response to him. They moved on, as he thought,
and he followed. But they were not moving, they stayed in one place.
They simply made their singing seem farther each time.

Sedit followed till they stopped at last, would not sing any longer. He
could not tell what to do. "It is better for me to go back to my
basket," said he at last. He went back, put his basket on the bank east
of the pit, and said: "Now, my basket, I will leave you a while, I am
going away. I place you east of the pit. Rootstick, I place you east of
the basket. If Satok Pokaila asks where I am, you will move east,
basket, and you will fall east, rootstick. She will know which way I
went."

He went eastward, went a short distance, forgot the song, stopped,
thought what to do. The song then came back to him. The sisters began to
sing again. Sedit followed their song.

Satok Pokaila waited for red earth, waited till midday, then thought,
"I'll go and see if Sedit has a headache." She found the basket partly
filled with red earth, and the stick standing east of it. She looked in
the pit where Sedit had dug, and thought, "He must he here somewhere."
She searched, but could not find him.

"Where is Sedit?" asked she of the basket. "Where did he go?--Where is
Sedit?" asked she of the rootstick.

The basket moved eastward till it reached the stick, the stick fell
toward the east. Old Satok knew now what had happened. She took the
basket

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

and digging-stick home with her, put them up safely.

Sedit followed the sisters, sang himself, and listened to their song.
The song went southward, went away from the mountain. He followed till
he reached Tayam Norel. Sedit sat down. People asked where he came from,
where he was going. He would not tell, would not talk, did not care for
people's words. He thought of nothing, heard nothing but the song of
Kele's daughters.

He sat only a little while, and went away singing and listening to the
song of the sisters. Now it went eastward. He followed it to a mountain,
where he saw an old man setting a trap. This was old Pokok.

"Uncle, where are you going in such a great hurry?" asked Pokok.

"I am going east," replied Sedit. "You will not see me pass this way
again."

He hurried down the mountain, crossed a creek, and went straight up
another mountain; was just at the top, when he saw a very big man coming
toward him on the right hand as Sedit was going east. Sedit stopped,
looked, was afraid somewhat. The two stared at each other. The stranger
was very tall and very thick. Sedit was frightened. The big man never
stopped, went straight ahead westward. Sedit looked at him a long time,
didn't move, watched him going down the mountain. After he had gone
Sedit stood a long time, and then sat down.

"Why did he not speak to me?" thought Sedit.

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "He is the first
person I have met who wouldn't speak to me. Who is he? I should like to
know."

Sedit sat and thought all that day about the big man. He heard the song
always, at times very near him, but he thought so much about the big man
that he didn't follow it. He wondered if the big man would come again,
and said to himself, "I will wait and see."

About night Sedit thought, "If he comes and will not speak to me, I'll
kill him." All night he waited. He rose very early, had not slept any.
About sunrise he saw a man coming from afar, from the east, moving
westward. Sedit watched, had his bow and arrows ready. It was he who
would not speak the day before. Sedit shot him in the breast, shot
again. The big man paid no heed, passed right along. Sedit shot twenty
arrows. The stranger looked all the time at Sedit, said nothing. Sedit
shot twenty arrows more--spent all his arrows.

After he had shot away the forty arrows, and the man had passed right
close to him, Sedit sat down and thought, "Who is this that I cannot
kill him?" He thought a long time, and then knew that he must be Sas
Kiemila.

It was old Sas. Sas had been fooling Sedit, just as Kele's daughters had
fooled him.

Sedit heard the song again, and followed it. He went to the Bohema Mem
at Sawal Pom, went up Norken Mem till he came to Hin Pom where he heard
a great noise. Many people were dancing there.

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

"Oh. there is Sedit coming," said they. "Where is he going so fast?"

"Uncle, where are you going in such a great hurry?" asked one of the
men. "What news have you? Tell us what you have seen on your journey."

"I am travelling this country to look at it. I saw no one, can give you
no tidings of any one. I shall not pass this way again."

The man who spoke and the dancers were Hinwa people. Sedit rushed on,
came to a flat, saw a spring, and many persons drinking water.

"My grandsons, what are you doing, why do you drink so much water? Water
is bad for young people" (these people were birds of all sorts). Sedit
called the place Chilchil balus (bird drinking). He went on without
stopping or talking,--had no time for either. He listened, heard the
singing near a hill, ran there; heard talking of many people, the
Tsurats arguing about acorns.

Sedit passed these people, crossed the Norken Mem, ran along the trail,
came to an old man lying across it at the foot of a mountain. Sedit,
going fast, thought to jump over the old man, but he moved, and Sedit
stopped. "Grandson, what are you doing?" asked Sedit. This was Pom
Piweki. "I cannot tell what to do," said Pom. "I am old, I cannot
travel; so I lay down here."

"I will go on," said Sedit, "and come back this way, I think." He heard
the song nearer now; followed it, followed till sunset, when it ceased.
He stayed all night in that place.

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

Next morning, some time after sunrise, the song began again. Sedit
answered, and followed it. Then it ceased; he stopped again; then the
song began a second time; he followed; the song ceased. The song circled
around the mountain, going a little higher gradually; sometimes it was
near, sometimes it seemed far away, but he never came up to it.

After wandering ten days, perhaps, he reached the top of the mountain by
going round and round the side of it. The singing was in the mountain
now all the time. He was on the highest part of Kele's sweat-house.
Kele, his twenty sons, and two daughters were inside, and the girls and
old man knew that some one was walking on the roof of their sweat-house.
Kele's sons went out each morning, and so did his daughters. Although
they were many, Sedit never saw one of them,--they fooled him. At last,
when Sedit was on the mountain, Kele shouted,--

"If any one is on my house, let him go down to the western door of it."

Sedit heard, and went back the way by which he came. He went to Pom
Piweki and asked: "Do you know where the door to this sweat-house is?"

Pom Piweki made no answer. He stood up and pulled open a door; it seemed
as though he had been lying across the entrance. When he opened the
door, Sedit saw far into the house.

"Sedit, if you are here to go in, this is the way for you," said Pom
Piweki. "You will see an old man lying on the east side, go to him and
talk; this is his sweat-house."

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

Sedit went in and sat down near Kele, said nothing. Kele rose up and
gave Sedit food, talked to him, told him what kind of person he, Kele,
was, and about his children, and said: "Sedit, if you have come here to
stay, you must do what I tell you; you must be careful. I have rough
sons; if they know that you are here, they will make trouble. I will
hide you. They will make a noise, but you will not suffer if you keep
quiet; if you move, they will find you, and abuse you, surely."

Kele put Sedit in a basket in the ground, hid him there, leaving a small
hole to look through. "You may look out, but do not move," said Kele.

As soon as Sedit was hidden the girls came in with roots, and sat down
at their sleeping-place. Sedit was near them. He thrust out his hand and
pinched the younger sister. She said nothing.

"Sister, have you seen any one?" asked she, after a time; "some one
pinched me."

"\`Sh!" said the elder, "be quiet and say nothing; don't let our father
hear."

The elder went to cook, and Kele's twenty sons came hammering and
tramping.

The first ten, the smooth ones, came, as always, quietly; the second ten
came with a rush and an uproar. Sedit peeped out at them.

The younger sister pushed him back. "Be still," said she.

Sedit tried to rise; she kept him down.

The first man of the second ten cried, "Pshu! I smell Sedit."

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

The second said, "Pshu! I smell Sedit; throw him out!"

"Be quiet, boys; don't talk so," said Kele. "Sedit is your uncle."

"Phew! I smell Sedit," cried all the second ten.

Kele could hardly keep his sons from taking Sedit. After they had eaten
they grew more excited. "Where is Sedit?" cried they. "Let us find
Sedit!"

At last they found Sedit, dragged him out, played ball with him, threw
him around the whole night from one side of the great house to the
other. Kele could do nothing, could not stop them. He went and lay down.
About sunrise Sedit screamed. He was almost dead. Kele's ten rough sons
were covered with deer blood and shouted all night. The smooth ten sat
still, could do nothing against the rough ten.

About sunrise Sedit could hardly breathe. He had a root under his left
arm, and as he was hurled across the house it fell into the fire and
made a great smoke. The odor was very pleasant. Kele's sons liked it.
They threw Sedit back to where they found him, left him, and began to
breathe in the smoke.

"My sons," said Kele, "I told you last night not to hurt or harm Sedit;
let him alone. That root which he dropped will be good for you, and
hereafter you will like it. Future people when going to hunt will take
this root, tsarauhosi, hold it out, and say, 'Kele, give us deer.' They
will give you the root, and you will give them deer. When they go

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

hunting and have bad luck, they will make a fire, burn this root, hold
it out while it smokes, and say, 'Kele, will you put deer where we can
see and kill them?'" (Wintu hunters carry this root and burn it if they
have bad luck in finding deer. Kele likes the odor and sends them deer).
Kele rubbed Sedit with deer marrow, put him on the west side of the
sweat-house, and said, "This is your place; you will stay here."

The boys went to hunt, the girls to dig roots as before.

"How did you get those sons, brother?" asked Sedit once.

"You have no need to know; I will not tell you," replied Kele.

"How did you build this house? Two old men should not live in one house.
If I had a house, your sons could visit me when they wished, see their
uncle's house, and stay all night, perhaps."

"I don't think you could have sons, Sedit, or keep a house. I don't
believe you have strength for it; these things are hard to do," said
Kele.

But Sedit talked on about sons and a sweat-house. Kele asked Sedit to
sing for his sons while they danced and sweated. He sang twice and sang
fairly. "I could sing well if I had a house and sons of my own,"
remarked Sedit.

"I will build a sweat-house for him," thought Kele, at last. "He may go
through as I have. I don't think he will, but I can let him try."

The next night Kele made all sleep soundly. He went north a short
distance and wished for a sweat-house.

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> A mountain stood
in front of him next moment. Kele went home before daylight and lay
down. That day Sedit talked on as before.

"Come," said Kele; and he took him to the new mountain. "You can live
here if you like. This is your house." Kele left him then.

Sedit made a fire, found a pipe and tobacco, smoked, stayed many days
and nights by himself there. "I should like to know how Kele got his
sons," thought he one night. "I must ask him."

"I come to tell you," said Sedit one morning, "that I am lonesome. I
want to know how you got your sons and daughters."

Kele made no answer for a long time. At last he told him how he got his
daughters.

Sedit went home, did exactly as Kele had done, then lay down without
sleeping. Toward morning he heard some one jump to the floor; next he
got a blow on the back, then a second. The two persons went away and sat
down. Sedit rose, made a big fire, and began singing for a sweat-dance.
Two girls stood near the fire, sweated, then went to the creek, swam,
and went home. They had very long hair and were nice looking. Sedit gave
them wooden combs and mink-skins for their hair, gave them food and nice
baskets painted red, told each to dig roots and cook them.

Sedit lived a while with his daughters, till he thought once, "I want to
have sons." He went to Kele, and Kele told how he had got sons, told
carefully.

Sedit cut the sticks, did everything as Kele said,

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

and lay by the fire, but he could not keep from looking up; the moment
he looked all the sticks fell to the ground. Sedit put them in place
again, lay by the fire, looked up. The sticks fell a second time; he put
them up again, lay down, looked a third time. The sticks fell a third
time. He was putting the sticks up till daylight, when he had to stop.
Sedit went to Kele that day. "My sticks were falling all night," said
he.

Kele knew what had happened already. "Why not do as I told you? I told
you not to look up."

"I will not look any more," said Sedit.

Next night he put up sticks again and waited, took the blows till the
last one of the second ten was giving him ten blows, then he sprang up
and screamed. All the twenty sons dropped down and were sticks again. It
was just daylight. Sedit gathered the sticks into a basket, and looked
to see if the girls were awake. They were sticks as well as the others.

Sedit felt very sorry, could not tell what to do. He put the two sticks
with the other twenty, took one at a time, held it up, and said, "This
was my son, this was my daughter." He was sorry and wondered if he could
make others. He went to Kele and said,--

"My brother, I could not stand it."

"What did I tell you?"

"Can I not make more?"

"Perhaps you cannot endure it." Kele did not want him to try.

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

"I am sorry for my girls," said Sedit, "I want them back; I was fond of
them."

"You may try for sons, but those girls will not come back."

Sedit tried a third time. The beating was so hard that he almost
screamed; but he held out this time, and had twenty sons. Sedit's house
was full of sons, but he had no daughters; the sticks would not turn to
girls again, though he did with them as he had the first time.

Sedit sent his sons to hunt. "Go wherever you like," said he. "On the
west side is a ridge; go on that ridge, keep in one line, and when you
turn some one may see you and think, 'What a crowd of nice boys!'"

Kele's boys were hunting that day, and saw Sedit's sons in a long line.
"Look at that row of men on the ridge," said they. "Those are our
cousins," said one of the smooth ten; "those are Sedit's sons."

Sedit's sons went to a flat, danced and played all the day, took yellow
clay, made paste of it, painted themselves yellow--that is why coyotes
are yellow to this day; the paint would not wash off All went home in a
line. Sedit had supper for them.

"Why do you come without deer?" asked Sedit.

"We danced on the flat and painted."

Sedit said nothing. All ate; then Sedit thought,

"I wish you boys to sleep." All fell asleep. Sedit went to Kele, woke
him up, and said,--

"My sons went to hunt, but came home without deer. What shall I do with
them?"

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

"Let them hunt birds. Let them hunt gophers and grasshoppers in the
meadows. Gophers are as good as deer."

"All right," said Sedit; and he went home and slept.

They brought grasshoppers and gophers from the hunt next day, and Sedit
was satisfied.

"Let them live on that kind of food," thought he.

They told of their hunting that day. "We wanted water," said one of
them, "and met an old woman. 'We are dry and cannot find water,' said we
to her. 'I will give you water,' said the old woman; 'come with me.' We
followed her a while. I was afraid and said to my brothers, 'Do not
drink the water she gives.' One of my brothers shouted at the old woman
and frightened her. She fell back and turned into a swamp with a spring
in the middle of it. We didn't go near the spring, but were nearly lost
in the swamp."

"That is a wicked old woman, said Sedit. "That is Tunhlucha Pokaila. She
drowns people often. I met her once and she came near drowning me. Don't
you go near her again. Hunt gophers and grasshoppers elsewhere."

"Now, my sons," said Sedit, some days later, "go and scatter around
through this country. Whenever you want to see me come here to my
sweat-house."

Sedit's sons scattered north, south, east, and west. They were at every
ridge and point, in every valley and meadow, at every spring and river.

Kele's sons stayed at their great mountain sweat-house, doing the same
things, living in the same way. The two sisters never married, and all
Kele's people are in that mountain now. When they go out they look like
wolves; but when inside, when at home in the mountain, they are people.
