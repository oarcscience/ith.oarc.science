### THE WINTUS

THE Wintus are a nation or stock of Indians who before the coming of
white men owned and occupied all that part of California situated on the
right bank of the Sacramento, from its source near the foot of Mount
Shasta to its mouth at the northern shore of San Francisco Bay.

<span id="page_488">p. 488</span>

These Indians extended into Trinity County on the west, and still
farther to the mountain slope which lies toward the Pacific. Only a
small number of them, however, were on the western declivity. The great
body of the nation lived on the eastern slope of the Coast Range and in
the Sacramento Valley. Some of their finest mental productions are
connected with the upper course of the Sacramento and with the MacCloud
River, or Wini Mem.

It is difficult to determine what the Wintu population was half a
century ago, but, judging from the number of houses in villages, the
names and positions of which have been given me by old men, I should say
that it could not have been less than 10,000, and might easily have been
double that number. At present there are not more than 500 Wintus in
existence.

The Wintus have suffered grievously; great numbers have been killed by
white men, others have perished by diseases brought in by strangers; but
those who remain ore strong and are more likely to increase than
diminish. Times of violence have passed, and the present Wintus are
willing and able to adapt themselves to modern conditions.

It may be of interest to readers of these myth tales to know something
of the present condition of the Wintus.

In 1889, when I was in California, commissioned by Major Powell for the
second time to make linguistic investigations among various tribes of
the Pacific coast, a few Wintus came to me in Redding, California, and
complained of their wretched condition. There was not a spot of land,
they said, where they could build a hut without danger of being ordered
away from it. "This country was ours once," added they, "but the white
man has taken all of it." I told them to bring their people together,
and invite also the Yanas, who had suffered more than all other people
of that region, and then explain to me what was needed.

The two peoples met on a little stony field in a brushy waste outside
the inhabited part of Redding. There they made speeches and discussed
matters for three hours the first day and as many the second. They gave
me all the points of what they wanted, which was simply that the United
States should give each man of them a

<span id="page_489">p. 489</span>

piece of land, with help to begin life on it. I jotted down in brief
form what they had told me, read it to them, and they were satisfied.
Next day the paper was copied in the form of a petition from the two
nations to President Harrison. They signed the petition before a Redding
notary, and gave it to me with a request to lay it before the President.

Early in i 890 I was in Washington. Anxious to win the case of my poor
Indian friends,--or "Diggers," as some men are pleased to call them
contemptuously,--I looked around for a Congressman of influence to go
with me to support the petition before the President. I found no
suitable person till I met my classmate and friend, Governor Greenhalge
of Massachusetts, at that time a member of Congress. When he heard the
tale of the Yana massacre and realized the sad plight of the Wintus, he
offered at once to cooperate with me. He went to the President and
explained the affair to him. Two or three days later he accompanied me
to the White House. I gave the petition to President Harrison, who
promised to favor it with his executive initiative. He did this so
earnestly and with such emphasis that an agent was appointed very soon
to find land for those Indians. The agent found land for them in various
places, but within the radius of their former possessions. The condition
of the Wintus at present is this: They have lands which are described,
but in most cases the boundaries are not indicated by any material mark,
or at least very few of them are; white men are trespassing, and it is
impossible for the Indians to protect themselves till their boundaries
are fixed tangibly. They will not have the means to begin serious work
till they receive assistance. They are waiting now in hope that the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs will have their lands surveyed, and that
Congress will make a small appropriation for their benefit. This is the
extent of their hopes and wishes. They are very glad to have land, and
the majority of them will make fairly good use of it. When I met them in
1895, they were very grateful for the part which I had taken in settling
them in life, adding that they could not have settled themselves
unassisted. As to me, I cannot but make an emphatic acknowledgment of
the generous and effective aid given by Governor Greenhalge.

"Olelbis," the first myth published in "The Sun" (March 19, 1896), was
preceded by the following brief introduction:--

The Wintus, with whose creation-myths I begin this series, are a very
interesting people. Their language is remarkably harmonious, rich, and
flexible. It has great power of describing the physical features of the
country in which it is spoken, as well as the beliefs and ideas of the
Wintus themselves.

The picture of Olelbis, a being who lives in the highest and sees
everything, is drawn more distinctly and with more realism than any
character in other American religious systems, so far as I know.

The theory of creation evolved by the Indians of North America is
complete, simple, and symmetrical. I have referred to it somewhat in the
introduction to "Hero Tales of Ireland," in "Myths and Folk-lore of
Ireland," and in "Myths and Folk-tales of the Russians, Western Slavs,
and Magyars." This theory is in brief as follows:--

There was a people in existence before the present race of men in
speaking of the present race of men, the tales have in view Indians
only. This first people lived in harmony for a period of indefinite,
unimaginable duration, without division or
dissension,--undifferentiated, so to speak. This was the golden age of
existence, a Nirvana preliminary to life as we know it at present, a
Nirvana of the gods, as the Buddhist extinction of self is to be the
Nirvana of just men when all shall be one in all and one in one. At last
a time came when character appeared, and with it differences and
conflicts. When the conflicts were past and the battles fought out, the
majority of the first people were turned into all the animated things,
walking, creeping, crawling, swimming, flying, that have ever been seen
on the earth, in the water, or in the air. They were turned also into
trees and plants of every kind,--some into heavenly bodies, others into
remarkable stones and rocks, just as, in the Bible, Lot's wife was
turned into a pillar of salt.

According to this theory, every individual existence which we see in the
world around us is a transformed or fallen god. Every beast, bird,
reptile, fish, insect, or plant was at one time a divinity of high or
low degree, an uncreated person who had lived in harmony with his
fellows from the beginning till the time when variety

<span id="page_491">p. 491</span>

of character, or individuality, appeared and brought with it
difficulties, or perhaps we might say, penalty. With individuality came
conflicts; when those conflicts were over, creation was finished.

At the end of each particular conflict the victor turned by means of a
word the vanquished into that which embodied and expressed his
character. The vanquished on his part had a similar compelling word, and
changed his opponent into the beast, bird, or other existence which
described him; in other terms, he gave his opponent the physical form,
the outward personality, which corresponded to the nature of his hidden
or at least his unapparent character. Besides these metamorphosed or
fallen divinities, there is in the Indian mythologies a group, a small
minority, which was not changed, but left this world going out under the
sky at the west to live in harmony and delight; and they live in that
way to this moment. Sometimes this group, or a part of it, went to live
above the sky.

The Indian Creation-myths all relate to the adventures and exploits of
the "first people,"--the gods; none relate to human beings, and none
touch on anything done since man appeared on earth. They are the
accounts of what took place when there was an order different from the
present, and explain how the present order rose from the first.

Such, in substance, is the foundation of American religious systems, and
the method of all of them, so far as examined. The Wintu is different
from many others in its methods and details, but the result is the same
in all cases. Olelbis, with few exceptions, disposes of the first
people, retains with himself whomsoever he likes, sends to the earth and
transforms those whom he thinks more useful below than above, and gives
the example of a single ruling divinity which, without being represented
as all-powerful or all-wise, manages through the knowledge and services
of others to bear rule over all things.
