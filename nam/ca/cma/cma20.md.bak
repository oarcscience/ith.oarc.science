\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Titindi Maupa lived at a place called Kurulsa Mauna, where he had two
sisters. Three miles west of that place lived young Topuna with his
father, who had a great sweat-house at Motiri Mauna.

Titindi Maupa wished his elder sister to marry Topuna, his great friend,
who was a good hunter and killed many deer. One day Titindi Maupa told
his two sisters to make ready much food,--roots, acorns, and pine nuts.

The women made these things ready and put them into a round basket. He
put the basket on his back, took two otter-skins as presents, and went
to Motiri Mauna.

Old Topuna was sitting at home. His son had gone off before daylight to
hunt deer in the mountains. Titindi Maupa saw a great deal of venison
and deer fat hanging around in all parts of the sweat-house.

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

He looked in from the top of the sweat-house, and saw the old man
cutting meat, breaking bones, and taking marrow out of them. He went in.
Topuna stood up to meet him, made a fire, cooked meat, put it in a
basket, and set it down before Titindi Maupa. He gave him also fat and
dried venison.

"I have food on the top of the sweat-house," said Titindi Maupa. "I left
my basket there."

Topuna went and brought it, put it down, then ate of it himself. The
visitor ate much, and the two sat long together talking and eating; sat
till midday, when young Topuna came home. He had killed five deer and
was glad.

"You came to see us," said he, sitting down near the visitor.

"Yes," answered Titindi Maupa, "and you will come soon, I hope, to my
house. You will come to-night, perhaps?"

Topuna gave Titindi Maupa nice venison and deer fat,--a great deal of
it. "Be light and small till he takes you home," said Topuna to the
meat; "then be as big as you now are or bigger."

He gave the visitor a beautiful buckskin dress, and Titindi Maupa went
home.

The pack was light till he set it down at home. Then it grew as big as a
small house. His elder sister would not eat Topuna's venison; she did
not like her brother's friend; she loved young Hitchinna, and would not
look at the other man.

Topuna put on three pairs of moccasins, three pairs of thick buckskin
leggings trimmed with

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

beads; put on three buckskin blankets, and at dark he went out of the
door to go to Kurulsa Mauna.

"My son," said old Topuna, when his son was going, "you will come back
sorry; you will be angry in the morning; I know that woman well."

All were asleep at Titindi Maupa's when Topuna came; but Titildi Marimi
had wished the whole house outside to be covered with sharp rocks and
thorny brush, for she knew that Topuna was coming.

When he reached the place, he could not go in; he could not find the
door, even; everything was hidden with sharp rocks and thorns. He was
outside all night, and never stopped trying to find the way in; he wore
out his three pair of moccasins, tore his three pair of leggings and
three blankets; bits of them were scattered all around the sweat-house.
At last he was naked and nearly frozen.

Topuna went home before daylight, very angry. Titildi Marimi had heard
him, but said not a word. He lay down in his father's sweat-house and
stayed there all day.

When daylight came, Titildi Marimi rose up and went out of the
sweat-house; the rocks and brush were all gone at her wish; nothing
there now but the nice beads that had fallen from Topuna. She went to
the spring; washed there, combed and dressed her hair, painted her face
red, put on a nice woven cap, took a little basket with a sharp stick,
and went out on the mountain; went far; dug sweet roots by the creeks on
the mountain flats.

Titindi Maupa was angry at his sister all day; he stayed in bed until
evening. Titildi Marimi dug

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

roots, dug a great many, singing all the time while she worked.
Hitchinna heard the singing from his place and came to her. She liked
him. She went to meet him; was pleased to see him; they sat down
together, talked, and were glad. They parted for that day; he hunted
deer, she filled her basket with roots and went home about sundown.

Titindi Maupa was in bed yet. He did not raise his eyes when she came;
did not look at his sister.

Next morning she rose early; rose at daylight. She had promised
Hitchinna to meet him a second time. She washed, combed her hair,
painted her face, took a basket with a root stick, and started.

She had not gone far when her brother sprang up, hurried to the river,
swam in it; went back to the sweat-house, striking his hair as he went
with a stick to make it dry quickly. Then he ate, and said to his
younger sister,--

"I am going away; I must leave you; you will cry, I think, because I am
going."

He put on rich clothes, then tied a string of nice beads to a staff, and
fastened the staff in one corner of the house corners.

"If I die," said he, "those beads will fall to the ground; do not touch
them while they are hanging, and say to our sister not to touch them.
When she comes, do not say that I have gone; if she knows herself, you
must not show her the way that I have taken."

Then he turned to each thing in the house and said, "You, my
poking-stick, must not tell my sister how I have gone, nor you, my
baskets, nor

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

you, my fire, nor you, my basket of water, nor my roots; not one of you
must tell her." And he told everything except the acorn flour; he forgot
to tell the acorn flour.

"Now I go," said he; and pushing up the central post of the house, he
went in to the ground, and the post settled back after him. He went
underground until he reached a spring of water. From the spring he
turned back and went west, then back; went north, then back; went south,
then back to the spring. Next he went in circles around his house to
mislead his sister, so that she might not track him. At last he went
west two or three miles; then he rose to the top of the ground, and went
off on a trail.

When she went to the mountain flat on the second morning, Titildi Marimi
stood a while thinking. She knew that her brother was out of bed, that
he was very angry. "My brother will go away to-day," thought she. "I
must be home again soon."

She threw down her stick and basket quickly and hurried home. She saw
that her brother was not in the house, that her sister was crying.

"Where is my brother," asked she; "tell me, my sister."

The sister would not speak, gave no answer; held down her head and cried
bitterly.

"Tell me quickly. The sun is high. If I cannot come up with him, he will
die; if I do not find him, his enemies will kill him." The sister did
not answer.

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

"Tell me, you rock, which way my brother went; tell me quickly. Tell me,
you poking-stick; tell me, baskets." Nothing gave answer. "Post, tell
me, tell quickly; it is too late almost, he will escape me." She asked
everything and got no answer, till at last she said, "Acorn flour, will
you tell me?"

"Your brother is gone," said the acorn flour. "He is angry because you
injured Topuna, his friend; he is very angry, and does not wish you to
follow him."

"Which way did he go? Under the post."

"That is well."

She was glad then. She made ready quickly; put on nice, new things, took
her best bow and a big otter-skin quiver filled with arrows, put on
leggings like a man.

"My sister, be well, take good care of yourself," said she. "I don't
want my brother to die. He thinks that the journey is pleasant, that the
journey is easy. I will go, too; I will help him."

She pushed up the post and followed her brother; went to the spring,
came back, followed him everywhere; came out at last on the trail and
tracked him, followed him, toiled along over Backbone Mountain. She
followed hard and fast, gained on him, kept gaining; still she was
afraid that she could not come up with her brother. She turned then to
Sun and called out.--

"O Sun. I wish you to be slow. Go very slowly to-day, O Sun. Let the day
be long. Give me time to come up with my brother."

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

The Sun went more slowly, gave her time, and she hurried on.

Titindi Maupa all this while was hurrying, going on quickly; and he sang
as he went. His song was of Paiowa, Wakara's youngest daughter, a maiden
far off in the west.

Wakara had a great many daughters. All the stars in the sky were his
children, and all his daughters were married but this one, the youngest,
the one whom Titindi Maupa was going to marry if her father would give
her.

He went along the Daha, went as the stream flows, swam across and sat
down to smoke. When he had emptied his pipe, he went up on the mountain
ridge west of the river, reached the top, and walked some distance down
on the western slope, sat again and smoked a second time. Now Titildi
Marimi, his sister, had crossed the river and was following. She came to
where her brother had sat to smoke the first time.

"I will come up with you soon," said she. "You cannot go from me now;"
and she followed on, followed quickly.

The brother, when he smoked the second time, sat at a little spring on
the western slope of the mountain ridge; the sister reached the ridge
from the top; she saw her brother a little below her. He heard some one
behind, looked up, and saw Titildi Marimi. He held his head down, he
said nothing.

"I shall be with you soon," cried the sister. "We can go on together.
You have come a long way to find a good smoking-place."

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span>

He said nothing, looked at the ground, waited for his sister. Soon she
was there with him.

"My brother, I am tired," said she, "give me tobacco; I wish to smoke."

He gave her tobacco; she smoked.

"My brother," said Titildi Marimi, "I want you to shoot at that quartz
rock over there on the mountain side."

He raised his bow with an arrow and took good aim.

"Now hit that rock," said she.

He sent one arrow, after it a second, and then a third. They hit the
rock, but bounded back from it.

"You might go a long way to hurt an enemy with arrows of that sort!"
laughed the sister. "Do you think those good arrows, my brother? You
will see enemies enough in two days; you will see enemies in the house
of Wakara."

She drew out her own bow then, took an arrow from her otter-skin quiver,
and said, "Look now at me, my brother!"

She shot at the rock; hit it. Her arrow shivered the rock to pieces.

"This is what my arrows do!" said Titildi Marimi.

Titindi Maupa hung his head; said not a word, but rose and went down the
mountain side till he came to a creek; then he crossed another mountain,
going westward all the time till he was in sight of Wakaruwa, the place
to which he was going; then he sat down a third time and smoked.

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

"O smoke," said he, "I wish you to make friends to-night and to-morrow
for me."

He looked down into the valley, where he heard much noise; he saw many
people playing games and shooting.

Just before this Wakara had called his youngest daughter, Paiowa, and
said, "I want you to gather oak leaves for the acorn bread, and red
earth to mix in it."

She went with a basket on her back, went up to the mountain side,
gathered red earth to mix with the acorn flour and make the bread light.
The leaves were to be put on the top of the dough and cover the bread
while baking. Titindi Maupa put his sister with her quiver in an
otter-skin and carried her. She had made herself small, and seemed just
like an otter; he hid her on his shoulder in this form.

Paiowa, Wakara's youngest daughter, had put red earth in her basket and
filled it with leaves. She turned around now to stoop and raise it, but
could not, it was too heavy.

Titindi Maupa had slipped up and was holding the basket. She turned to
see what the trouble was, and saw him right there almost touching her.

"Oh!" cried she, frightened and dropping her head; she was shamefaced
before the stranger.

"Why are you afraid?" asked Titindi Maupa. "Is it because I am ugly?

She raised the basket to her back, and rushed away. When she reached
Wakaruwa, she threw down the basket outside, and ran into the house past
her mother.

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

"Why are you so frightened? What is the matter?" asked her mother.

Not a word did she answer.

Old Wakara was sitting inside. "Why are you frightened, my daughter?"
asked he. "Has anything happened, has any one hurt you?"

"I saw a man over there on the mountain."

"What kind of man was he?" asked Wakara.

"He has an otter on his back and wears buckskin; his hands are both red
with deer blood."

Titindi Maupa had a large piece of fat venison in his otter-skin quiver.

"He is a good hunter, I think," said Wakara; and he took down an
otter-skin, put it on the north side of the house, and said to his
daughter, "Sit there and let this man come to you."

It was night soon. All the people came into the house, sat down, and ate
supper. Titindi Maupa stopped outside for a while, and found a place
where Wakara stored acorns. "I will leave you here for this night," said
he to his sister. "To-morrow I will come to get you."

Titindi Maupa left his sister in the acorn crib, sank in the ground
then, and came up inside the sweat-house right at the side of Paiowa.
Old Wakara laughed when he saw him sitting near his daughter. He was
glad.

"Give the stranger food," said he.

Paiowa brought food and gave it to the stranger.

Titindi Maupa ate some and said, "Look in my otter-skin, I have some
venison."

She put her hand in, found a good piece, a nice

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

saddle of venison. She could not draw the piece out, it was so heavy.
She went then to her father and said, "I must have a big basket."

She took a large tray basket over to her place. Titindi Maupa drew out
the venison and put it on the tray, saying,--

"Now, be no smaller, my venison, stay as you are, no matter how much
they take from you."

Two girls carried the basket and put it down before Wakara and Hemauna
Marimi, his wife. The two old people ate. After them all in the house
ate, and the saddle of venison was as large as at first. When all in the
house had eaten, old Wakara went out on the housetop and shouted,

"My sons, I call you all to come in for a short while."

Now, all the stars in the sky were Wakara's children; they were his sons
and daughters. The greatest, a son, came in first. When near the house,
he had caught the odor of venison. Behind him came a great many people.
All the stars were in Wakara's sweat-house; the whole place was filled
with them. When they looked and saw Titindi Maupa sitting with their
sister, they laughed. They were glad. Some sat down; others cut off the
venison and roasted it. All ate what they wanted.

Now, old Wakara himself cut off venison, and gave a large share to each
son to carry home for his wife and children. All went away laughing.

Titindi Maupa rose before dawn the next morning, took a deer head, and
went hunting to a mountain. He put on the head. Deer came and stood

<span id="page_400">p. 400</span>

before him, ten, then ten more, and soon there were a hundred. He killed
the hundred deer. Taking the smallest, he opened it, made the others
very little, and put them into the small one, which he carried in one
hand.

All were sleeping in the sweat-house when Titindi Maupa came. He threw
down the small deer, and the ninety-nine others were as big as at first;
they burst out of the small one, made a great noise, and filled all the
space before the sweat-house. Wakara's wife had got up to make acorn
bread. She tried to go out, but could not, there were so many deer lying
around everywhere. She hurried back and called her husband.

"There is something outside," said she; "I do not know what it is. Get
up and look, get up quickly!"

Wakara went out and saw piles of deer; he ran back, took his knife and
sharpened it. Then going to the top of the house, he called to the whole
village, "Come here; come, all of you!"

All the people of the village came soon, and there were so many that the
venison was dressed quickly. They cooked and ate in company. Others came
from beyond the river south of them, and ate all the venison they
wanted. Many sat down under oak-trees and gambled; some shot arrows at
marks, and others raced.

All day they amused themselves; all day they feasted, and went home at
sunset very glad and praising Titindi Maupa.

West of Wakaruwa, was a large village and many

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

people, all Wakara's sons-in-law, all married to his daughters; and the
chief was Lawalila.

"I wonder what my father-in-law is doing," said each of these people;
"he has very loud talk in his sweat-house. There has never been such
talk there before."

Lawalila called his two sons and said: "Go and see what your grandfather
is doing. Your youngest aunt has a husband; perhaps that is why there is
such loud talk at the sweat-house."

The two boys stole up to the house carefully, and peeped into it. The
younger saw Paiowa, his aunt, in one corner. and Titindi Maupa sitting
near her. Wakara saw the boy peeping in, and hurled a stick at him. The
two boys ran home.

"My aunt has a husband," said the younger boy. "She has not," said the
elder.

"I saw him," said the younger. "You did not," said the elder.

Lawalila stopped the boys; he was satisfied. He went out. and calling to
all said, "Paiowa, the youngest daughter of Wakara, is married!"

All were very angry now, all were enraged, for there were many in that
village who wanted Paiowa.

Next morning Lawalila roused the village early, and said: "I want you,
my people, to play to-day. You must play your best; you must beat
Titindi Maupa, Wakara's new son-in-law."

After they had eaten he called all his people together and said, "We
will go over to my father-in-law's, to Wakara's, and shoot at a mark
there with arrows."

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

They went to Wakara's and asked: "Where is Titindi Maupa? We wish to try
him; we want to shoot arrows at a mark against him."

Titindi Maupa came out and shot. He won the first shot. the second; he
won all the time, won everything that Lawalila's people wagered.

Just at noon Lawalila lost his temper, got angry, sprang up, tried to
seize and take back all the things that his people had lost. Titindi
Maupa would not let him do that; he stood in his way, would not let him
take anything.

Lawalila struck Wakara's new son-in-law. Titindi Maupa threw down his
opponent. Lawalila jumped up, ran toward his people, drew his bow, and
tried to send an arrow through Titindi Maupa. A great fight now
followed.

Wakara's sons came and took Titindi Maupa's part. Lawalila's people
hurried to his side. Titindi Maupa's young wife ran out to help her
brothers and her husband.

They fought very hard on both sides. In the middle of the afternoon all
were killed on Lawalila's side except himself. New forces came to
Lawalila. Titindi Maupa was so tired that he could not stand. At this
moment his sister came. She picked up Titindi Maupa, put him on her
back, and gave him her bow and arrows. He shot from her shoulder. and
used her strong arrows. Every man that they touched fell that moment.
Every one from the west was killed, Lawalila with the others.

Titindi Maupa rested, and went to the sweat-house.

<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> His sister went
with him. The dead of both sides lay all night where they fell.

Before daybreak Titindi Maupa rose, took his fire-drill, went out, and
turning the faces of all his brothers-in-law to the earth, struck them
with the fire-drill. All came to life and went back to Wakaruwa.

Lawalila's people lay on the field all night, the next day, and the
night following. Titindi Maupa did not like to see all those dead people
lying there; so he went before daybreak of the second day and struck
each with his fire-drill. All came to life, rose up, were glad, and went
home. Next morning they came to Wakaruwa, and had games again, with good
feasting and pleasure. They did not get angry a second time.

Titindi Maupa brought in deer every morning. His brothers-in-law came
and ate with him; they were friendly and happy. Titindi Maupa stayed
twenty days at Wakaruwa. He killed deer for all of them. On the
twenty-first morning Wakara said to his daughter,--

"I think your husband would like to go home now."

Next morning Titindi Maupa set out for home with his wife and sister;
they went in one day to Kurulsa Mauna.

Three nights later Topuna came to visit them; he came again to see
Titildi Marimi. She let him come now. She was afraid that her brother
might leave her a second time.

So at last Topuna got the wife he wanted, and they all lived together at
Kurulsa Mauna.
