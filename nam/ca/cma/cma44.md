### SUKONIA'S WIVES AND THE ICHPUL SISTERS

IT is noteworthy that in Indian myths whenever two sisters are sent
somewhere, as in the present case, and warned by father or mother
against some deceiver who is likely to meet them on the way, the elder
sister is generally ready to become a victim, the younger is the wise
and obedient one, as in this myth.

We have again a case of putting on the skin of a slain person to become
like him or her.

The test of bringing water was perfect, since no one who was not of the
household could know where it was.
