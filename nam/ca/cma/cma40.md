### THE HAKAS AND THE TENNAS

This myth describes a deadly feud between the people who were turned
into flint, that is, fire, presumably lightning, and the grizzlies or
cloud people. After I had prevailed on him to give me the story, the
narrator told it with unfeigned delight. His sympathy with the old woman
Tsuwalkai was great, and his enthusiasm for Tsawandi Kamshupa, who rose
from the spittle of Tsawandi Kamshu, evident and striking. The origin of
Ilhataina in this myth and in the following called "Ilhataina," which is
the usual name for lightning, strengthens my view that the Wintu
Tulchuherris, a name which is merely an epithet, meaning, "dug up," is
the same person as Ilhataina of the Yanas. The regular acknowledged
lightning of the Wintus is called Walokit, who is a child of Wima
Loimis, grizzly-bear maiden, and the sun.
