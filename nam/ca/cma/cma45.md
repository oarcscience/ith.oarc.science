### THE FINDING OF FIRE

IN this, as in all Indian myths of the bringing of fire, it is procured
by stealing. The pursuit in all cases is most strenuous.

In one myth relays are posted along the road at short intervals these
deliver the fire to one another in great haste. At last the pursuers are
very near, when the fire is given to him who afterward becomes the
turtle; he places the treasure in his mouth and rolls into a deep river,
where he hides till the baffled masters of fire turn homeward sorrowing.
