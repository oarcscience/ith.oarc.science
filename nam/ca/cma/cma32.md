### HAWT

This myth of Hawt is very curious and subtle; it is one of the best told
tales that I have found anywhere. There is a largeness about it, and, at
the same time, a perfectly firm grasp on the part of Waida Dikit, the
master of the assembly, that produce a grand effect.

Though the story is long, it needs, I think, no explanation beyond what
is stated in the introduction and in preceding notes: except some
remarks touching the character of Hawt.

Hawt, the great musician, is identified with water; he is, as it were,
the spirit of water made visible.

In this myth, only the musical powers of Hawt are exhibited but in the
Yana Tirukala, which means the same thing as Hawt (lamprey eel), we see
the active side of the same personage, we see him as a worker. Original
is Hawt indeed,--a living flute fingering his own body as he would an
instrument inhaling air and blowing it out through the apertures in his
sides.

The present lamprey eel has marks, as it were, of holes in his sides.
