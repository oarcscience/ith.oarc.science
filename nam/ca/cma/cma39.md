### THE WINNING OF HALAI AUNA

THE Yanas were fond of astronomical myths, or myths of the upper world.
The morning star and the moon appear in them frequently. The great
sweat-house of the sun is the dome of heaven.

The name of the mysterious and mighty old uncle, Igupa Topa, seems to me
to be derived from Iguna, chief sweat-house, and Tuina or Toina, the
sun. Tuina is the prevailing pronunciation, but Toina is used also.
Igupa is the regular form of son of Iguna, as is Topa of Toina. He is a
person whose strength is well known to the sun, who has evidently a
clear perception of how dangerous a person he is.

The shooting of Wakara into the sky is a curious variant of the
tree-bending by Tulchuherris and Sas in the Wintu myth.
