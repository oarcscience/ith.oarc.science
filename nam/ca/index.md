<title>Intangible Textual Heritage: Native Californians</title>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There were hundreds of small tribes of Native Californians, with diverse
cultures and languages. Most Native Californian tribes were decimated by
disease and the stress of their virtual enslavement by the Spanish
Missionaries. Later the Americans hunted down and exterminated many of
the remaining tribes without mercy. Some were completely wiped out with
little trace, such as the Esselen of Big Sur. Others survived adversity
and remain active today, particularly some of the tribes in the
Northwest coast, and some of the Southern desert bands.

However, a great volume of detailed and accurate information on their
culture, mythology and religion is available. This is thanks to
pioneering anthropologists at the end of the 19th and beginning of the
20th centuries. Many of these scholars were affiliated with the
University of California.
