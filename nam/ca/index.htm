<P>
There were hundreds of small tribes of Native Californians, with
diverse cultures and languages.
Most Native Californian tribes were decimated by disease and the stress of
their virtual enslavement by the Spanish Missionaries.
Later the Americans hunted down and exterminated
many of the remaining tribes without mercy.
Some were completely wiped out with little trace, such as the
Esselen of Big Sur.
Others survived adversity and remain active today,
particularly some of the tribes in the Northwest coast, and some of the
Southern desert bands.
</P>
<P>
However, a great volume of detailed and accurate information on their
culture, mythology and religion is available.
This is thanks to pioneering anthropologists at
the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.
Many of these scholars were affiliated with the University of California.
