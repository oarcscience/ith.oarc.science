### FIRE MAKING.

The wood most used for fire making is that of *Baccharis Douglasii*. A
flat stick of this, as dry as possible, is obtained and a shallow hole
made in it, from which a small notch is cut to the edge of the stick.
The drill, a short piece of wood with the lower end trimmed to fit the
hole, is then placed in it and twirled rapidly between the palms with a
downward pressure. This causes a fine dust to be ground from the stick.
This dust runs out to one side through the notch, and if conditions are
favorable, after a time ignites, no tinder being used. But if the wood
is not thoroughly dry, or if the air is moist, it is exceedingly
difficult to kindle a fire by this method.
