### MARRIAGE.

Until recently a girl could not be taken for wife without the consent of
her parents or guardian. The suitor had to make a bargain with them, and
pay a price agreed upon, which seems to have been proportioned to some
extent to his wealth, as a well-to-do man would be expected to give more
than a poor one. Still marriage was not entirely a mercenary affair, as
a man who was idle or worthless, or a poor hunter, had, it is said, much
difficulty to obtain a wife, while one who was industrious, or a
skillful hunter, could easily do so. This shows that the parents or
guardians of a girl took an interest in her future welfare, and it seems
probable that her own inclination was consulted to some extent.

All accounts agree, however, that after her parents or guardians had
once disposed of her they had no more control over her.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Should she become
a widow, or separate from her husband, she was free to marry whom she
liked.

It is said that polygamy was not common, though some men would have two
wives, and occasionally more. The most usual form was for a man to marry
several sisters one after the other. It is said to have been permissible
for a free woman, such as a widow, to herself propose to a man that he
take her as a wife, even though he was already married, and it was
thought unchivalrous for him to refuse to do so. If a man had two or
more wives it was customary for him to give one of them to a brother who
might have lost his only wife. Until quite recently it was thought to be
in a measure obligatory for an unmarried woman to marry the husband of
her deceased sister. For her to decline to do so was thought to show
disrespect to the deceased sister.

Some say that another method of marriage was for a man and several of
his friends to carry off by force the woman he wished to marry, even
from the house of her parents.

Marriages with even distant relations were looked upon with extreme
disfavor.

When a child is adopted by an Indian family it is looked upon as one of
their own children, and its marriage with one of its foster relations is
regarded as incestuous.

One remarkable belief was that when a woman had a child, certain acts on
the part of its father would affect its health in the same manner as if
they were performed by the mother herself. So for some time after the
birth of a child its father was supposed to be as careful of himself as
its mother. He was forbidden to smoke, as that would choke the infant.
He was also careful not to take cold, as that would affect the infant's
health. Neither, if it was winter, was it allowable for him to drink
cold water. It was in fact thought improper for him to eat or drink
anything that is usually prohibited to a woman with a newly born child.
When an infant died within a few days of its birth, its mother often
attributed its death to the violation by its father of some of the
prescribed rules, and quarrels often arose between a husband and wife on
this account.

It was customary for a woman for a certain time after bearing a child to
keep herself with a fire in a close house.
