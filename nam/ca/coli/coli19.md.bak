### GOVERNMENT.

There was no government worthy the name among the Luiseños, in which
respect they seem not to have differed from most Indians of California.

Each clan <span id="fr_6"></span>[4](#fn_5.md) appears to have inhabited a
separate village, and to have been a law unto itself.

One sometimes hears of the power exercised by chiefs in other parts of
America, but the Luiseños seem to have been more democratic. There
appear to be no legends of powerful chiefs.

The religious chief of each clan seems to have possessed the most power,
all matters pertaining to religion being under his control. This office
was hereditary, though in some cases it might pass out of the direct
line of descent, as when the heir was incapable of performing the
duties. Women in some cases held the office.

The office of chief of the rabbit hunt was hereditary. Presumably the
medicine man possessed a certain amount of governmental power.

It is certain that the Indians fought at times, and it would seem that
on such occasions they must of necessity have had a leader.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_5"></span>[215:4](coli19.htm#fr_6.md) The term clan here and
in the following pages appears to be the equivalent of the word band in
the introduction. No mention is made by the author or by any other of
clan-totemism. It would seem that the Luiseño clan or band was similar
to the semi-totemic clans of the Mohave but without the totemism; or to
the village of the greater part of California, with perhaps greater
emphasis on real or imagined kinship and descent.
