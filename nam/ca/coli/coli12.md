### FEATHER OBJECTS.

The most valuable article made from feathers is a sort of apron or waist
dress, pa’lut. This extends about half way around the body, the upper
portion being net-work. To the lower part of the network the feathers
are attached by cutting part of the twine of the network, and tucking it
into the hollow of the quill. The wing or tail feathers of only three
birds can be used to make this skirt, namely, the golden eagle, the bald
or white-headed eagle, and the California vulture or condor. It is worn
at the morahash dance.

Another feather object, a long and flat band, is made of a double row of
feathers strung on two strings, the quills, which are turned inwards,
being perforated, and the strings passed through the perforations. This
object is worn slung over one shoulder, so as to hang diagonally across
the chest.

A bunch of feathers tied on the end of a stick, cheyat, is fastened on
the head and worn at certain dances. The feathers of owls, hawks, and
crows are used.

Feathers fastened to a cord so as to form a head-band are worn at
several dances and ceremonies.
