### MISCELLANEOUS ARTS.

The root of *Chenopodium Californicum* was grated and used as soap, also
the bulb of soap-root, *Chlorogalum pomeridianum*. The fruit of the wild
gourd, *Cucurbita foetidissima*, is broken open when ripe, and the
inside rubbed on articles to be cleaned.

A white clay is used to wash the head with; it is thought to be
beneficial for dandruff.

The pilaxpish or deer-antler tool for flaking stone arrowheads has been
mentioned.

A chisel was also made from deer antler. The base of the antler formed
the butt of the chisel, which a stone hammer was used to drive. An
antler as straight as possible was selected.

Tobacco pipes, hukapish, were usually made of clay, and had no stem, a
person, it is said, lying down to smoke. One kind of pipe had a stem,
but this seems to have been used only at religious festivals.

A rattle, paayat, is made of one or more land-turtle shells, with
choke-cherry stones or certain seeds inside.

A rattle was also made of a number of deer hoofs tied on the end of
loose strings. This was formerly used by hunters at a ceremony performed
by them before going to hunt deer, with the idea of insuring their
success.

Necklaces of deer hoofs, also of bear claws, were sometimes worn at
certain dances.

A mat of reeds or rushes was made by perforating and passing twine
through them. One was three feet by two feet nine inches, and had four
rows of twine. In this mat were rolled up the articles used at religious
ceremonies by the chief of festivals, not only his own, but also of the
other members of his clan.

Until quite recently a large receptacle was made for the

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

storage of acorns. Where boulders of sufficient size were near the
dwelling, the receptacles were placed on top. Otherwise they were put on
platforms of poles. They were made in a very rough manner of coils of
willow, *Adenostoma fasciculatum*, or other plants. These receptacles
have generally been called acorn granaries. The mouth is covered with a
flat stone. They are said to have held eight to twelve bushels.

A bullroarer, momlaxpish, consists of a flat stick with a double string
passed through a hole at one end. When the string is twisted tightly and
the stick swung around the head it makes a loud humming noise, and is
used to call the people together at feasts.

Several ornamented sticks were used at religious ceremonies. One of
these, paviut, had a pointed crystal inserted in one end, and sometimes
bits of shell glued to the sides with pitch a little below the crystal.

There seems to have been no musical instrument except a rude flute,
widolish. This was made from a piece of elder wood with the pith
removed. Specimens seen were about twenty inches long, and had four
holes.

A popgun of elder wood was made as a plaything for boys.

A syringe was made of the bladder of a deer and a piece of cane, the
bladder being inflated and then pressed with the hands to eject the
contents.

Several herbs are used to make tea, which is used partly as medicine,
and also as a beverage by people who are not ill. The tea is made by
steeping the plants in boiling water. The plants are sometimes used
fresh, but are oftener dried. The bird-claw fern, *Pellaea ornithopus*,
is one of the plants used for this purpose. Another is *Micromeria
Douglasii*, a creeping aromatic plant of the mint family growing in the
shade of trees. Another plant of the mint family, *Monardella
lanceolata*, is also used.

A tea was made from several different plants that were bitter and acted
as emetics when the throat was tickled with a feather. Emetics were
formerly much used.

The Luiseños made no intoxicating drink of any kind whatever, the
stupefying jimson-weed, *Datura meteloides*, being used for religious
purposes, not inebriation.
