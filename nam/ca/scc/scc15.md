# 13.--GASHOWU YOKUTS. THE OWL DOCTOR.

The prairie falcon made war on the northerners and was killed. Coyote
claimed to be a medicine man and was the first to doctor him. He was
merely a pretender who wanted to obtain pay. Then others, all owls,
doctored him. Hihina, the large owl, sodut, the white owl, wedjiji, the
ground owl, and hihimcha, the small owl, were the ones who doctored him.
It was the white owl that cured him.
