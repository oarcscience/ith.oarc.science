# 21.--TACHI YOKUTS. THE WOLF AND THE CRANE.

The wolf constantly hunted, but never gave his wife and two boys any
meat. Once in the morning He went hunting. Then his wife, the crane, ran
off. He returned and found her gone. He followed her. He was angry and
wanted to kill her. He saw her and tried to shoot her, but she was high
up in the air. Slowly she settled and at last lit far off. Then he shot
and hit her. He went to her. With her bill she tried to stab him. He
used an arrow to ward off her blows, and tried to stab her. Then she
pierced his breast and knocked him down. She stabbed him again and
again, until she killed him. Then she went off with her boys. They
turned into stars in the sky. She is in advance; her two boys are
following her. They are called yibish, the three stars of Orion.
