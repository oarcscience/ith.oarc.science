# 19.--TACHI YOKUTS. THE RACE OF THE ANTELOPE AND DEER.

The antelope and the deer were together. The antelope said: "I can beat
you running." The deer said: "I think not." The antelope said: "Well,
let us try." The deer said: "We shall run for six days," and the
antelope agreed. The deer said: "Let us go south and run northward."
Then they went far to the south "across the ocean" (or Tulare Lake), in
order to run northward to the end of the world. The antelope said: "This
will be my path on the west here. You take the path on the east." The
deer agreed. Then they started. Their path was the milky way. On the
side where the antelope ran there is a wide path; on the other side
there are patches. That is where the deer jumped. The antelope had said:
"If I win, all this will be my country and you will have to bide in the
brush." The deer said: "Very well, and if I win it will be the same for
me." Then they ran and the antelope won. So now he has the plains to
live in, but the deer hides in the brush.
