<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">29.--YAUDANCHI YOKUTS. THE PRAIRIE FALCON FIGHTS.[1]</H1>
<P>Long ago the prairie falcon (limik) lived alone. He came to a village. He returned. Then he went again. He reached a rock. He sat on top of it and laid his bow down on it. Then he thought: "It will be good if I kill them." He started again. Then he began the fight. He shot at them. At once the people there all became angry. There was a great battle. He killed them all. Then he hung up the hair of the killed on trees. It can be seen still (as moss) at a place called khodomo (probably in the territory of the Shoshonean T&uuml;batulabal or Pitanisha).</P>
