# 33.--YAUDANCHI YOKUTS. THUNDER AND WHIRLWIND.

Thunder and Whirlwind each had a boy. Thunder said: "You cannot find
your boy. I have hidden him from you." He had put him away enclosed in
stone. Then the Whirlwind rushed. He whirled by the rock, tore the top
off, and found his boy. Then the Whirlwind took Thunder's boy and
whirled off with him. He took him far away into the water. Thunder began
to look for his son. It became foggy. There was fine rain all around.
Thunder came with great noise. He hurled the rain and fog aside. He
found his son. So each of them succeeded in getting his boy again.
