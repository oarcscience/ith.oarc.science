# 25.--WÜKCHAMNI YOKUTS. THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD.

Told by a Yaudanchi Yokuts.

Everything was water except a very small piece of ground. On this were
the eagle and Coyote. Then the turtle swam to them. They sent it to dive
for the earth at the bottom of the water. The turtle barely succeeded in
reaching the bottom and touching it with its foot. When it came up
again, all the earth seemed washed out. Coyote looked closely at its
nails. At last he found a grain of earth. Then he and the eagle took
this and

laid it down. From it they made the earth as large as it is. From the
earth they also made six men and six women. They sent these out in pairs
in different directions and the people separated. After a time the eagle
sent the Coyote to see what the people were doing. Coyote came back and
said: "They are doing something bad. They are eating the earth. One side
is already gone." The eagle said: "That is bad. Let us make something
for them to eat. Let us send the dove to find something." The dove went
out. It found a single grain of meal. The eagle and Coyote put this down
on the ground. Then the earth became covered with seeds and fruit. Now
they told the people to eat these. When the seeds were dry and ripe the
people gathered them. Then the people increased and spread all over. But
the water is still under the world.
