# 6.--RUMSIEN COSTANOAN. COYOTE WITH A THORN IN HIS EYE.

Coyote came to some women and asked them to pull out a thorn from his
eye. There was only a little stick which he held in place with his
eyelid. At first they distrusted him. He selected the most beautiful;
"You draw it out," he sang. When she was about to take it with her
fingers, he said: "No, take hold of it with your teeth." He said this so
that he might seize her. When she took hold of the little stick he
seized her and ran off with her. His song:

Meneya doñ kac op ka yapunnin, you ( ?) me pull-out my thorn!
