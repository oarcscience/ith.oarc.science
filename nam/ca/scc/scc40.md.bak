# 38.--YAUELMANI YOKUTS. THE ORIGIN OF DEATH.

It was Coyote who brought it about that people die. He made it thus
because our hands are not closed like his. He wanted our hands to be
like his, but kondjodji (a lizard), said to him: "No, they must have my
hand." He had five fingers and Coyote had only a fist. So now we have an
open hand with five fingers. But then Coyote said: "Well, then they will
have to die."
