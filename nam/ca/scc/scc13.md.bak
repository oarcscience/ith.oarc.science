# 11.--GASHOWU YOKUTS. THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD.

The prairie falcon and the raven made the earth at a time when
everything was water. The beaver, the otter, the mud-hen, the mallard
duck, and a duck called potikh dived and tried to reach bottom, but
could not do so. Then k'uik'ui, a small duck, dived, reached the bottom,
and grasped the sand there. As he rose up, it washed out of his hands,
his mouth, and his ears. Only a little was left under his finger-nail.
When he came to the surface, he gave this to the prairie falcon. The
prairie falcon had tobacco. This he mixed with the sand. Then he divided
it, and gave half to the raven, whom he called his friend. They went far
to the north. There they separated. The prairie falcon sent the raven to
go southward on the west. He himself came southward along the east where
these mountains are now. As they

went they dropped the sand from between the thumb and finger. As the
sand fell into the water it began to boil and the world grew from
underneath. Then the raven surpassed the prairie falcon. These large
mountains which are now here were then in the west. When the prairie
falcon arrived he saw that the raven's mountains were the larger. Then
he changed them about. He put one in the place of the other without the
raven's knowledge.

So if it had not been for k'uik'ui and the prairie falcon the world
would not have been made. But it was the prairie falcon who first wanted
the world.
