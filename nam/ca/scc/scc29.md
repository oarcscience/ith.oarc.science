# 27.--YAUDANCHI YOKUTS. THE EAGLE AND THE CONDOR.

The eagle was chief. The condor did not like him. He tried to supersede
him as chief. Flying high in the air, he saw a bloody deer on the
ground. "Now I will have something to eat," bethought. He lit and began
to peck at the deer. The eagle, hidden under the brush on which the deer
was lying, caught him by the foot. "Now I have you! I will kill you," he
said. The condor said: "Let me go. You can be chief again. I will go
away." Then the eagle released him and was chief once more.
