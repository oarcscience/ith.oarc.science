# 37.--YAUELMANI YOKUTS. THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD.

At first there was water everywhere. A piece of wood (wichet, stick,
wood, tree) grew up out of the water to the sky. On the tree there was a
nest. Those who were inside did not see, any earth. There was only water
to be seen. The eagle was the chief of them. With him were the wolf,
Coyote, the panther, the prairie falcon, the hawk called po'yon, and the
condor. The eagle wanted to make the earth. He thought: "We will have to
have land." Then he called k'uik'ui, a small duck. He, said to it: "Dive
down and bring up earth." The duck dived, but did not reach the bottom.
It died. The eagle called another kind of duck. He told it to dive. This
duck went far down. It finally reached the bottom. Just as it touched
the mud there it died. Then it came up again. Then the eagle and the
other six saw a little dirt under its finger nail. When the eagle saw
this he took the dirt from its nail. He mixed it with telis and pele
seeds and ground them up. He put water with the mixture and made dough.
This was in the morning. Then he set it in the water

{p. 230\]

and it swelled and spread everywhere, going out from the middle. (These
seeds when ground and mixed with water swell.) In the evening the eagle
told his companions: "Take some earth." They went down and took a little
earth up in the tree with them. Early in the morning, when the morning
star came, the eagle said to the wolf: "Shout." The wolf shouted and the
earth disappeared, and all was water again. The eagle said: "We will
make it again," for it was for this purpose that they had taken some
earth with them into the nest. Then they took telis and pele seeds
again, and ground them with the earth, and put the mixture into the
water, and it swelled out again. Then early next morning, when the
morning star appeared, the eagle told the wolf again: "Shout!" and he
shouted three times. The earth was shaken by an earthquake, but it
stood. Then Coyote said: "I must shout too." He shouted and the earth
shook a very little. Now it was good. Then they came out of the tree on
the ground. Close to where this tree stood there was a lake. The eagle
said: "We will live here." Then they had a house there and lived there.

Now every evening when the sun went down tokho (sokhon, tobacco) came
there and went into the water in the lake. Coyote wanted to catch it.
The eagle asked him: "How will you do it?" Coyote said: "Well, I will do
it." He went off into the brush, rolled string on his thigh, and made it
into a snare, which he put into the water. Tokho came, entered the
water, and was caught. Coyote tried to take hold of it, but it was too
hot. He could not touch it. It was like fire. Only after the sun came up
was he able to take hold of it. Now, after he had held it all night, the
tokho said to him: "Take me to the house." Coyote asked it: "What does
tokho mean?" It said: "I am tobacco (sokhon). Give me to the prairie
falcon." Coyote brought it to the house and said: "Who wants this?" The
eagle did not want it. None of the seven wanted it except the prairie
falcon. He said: "I will take it." Coyote asked it: "What are you good
for?" The tobacco said: "I am good for many things. If there is anything
you want to have, use me, and then whatever it is that you wish will be
so." The prairie falcon said: "I will try it." At night he took a little
of the tobacco in his mouth and blew

{p. 231}

out: "Pu! I want it to rain." Then it began to rain. It rained all
night.

Then Coyote said: "We will make a woman of a deer." Then they killed a
deer. They put it under a blanket of tules. It was entirely covered.
When the morning star came it got up. It was a person (yokots) now. It
was a woman. Coyote said: "I will sleep with her." That night he slept
with her. In the morning he was dead. The woman was not hurt. The
prairie falcon took a sharp water-grass (kapi). He said: "Stick it in
his anus and he will get up." One of them put it in. Coyote got up
hurriedly. "Ah, I was sleepy," he said. He said: "That is not good. It
is not sweet. All men will die. We shall have to do it differently."
Then he killed her. He left her under the blanket over night. Then he
said: "To-night I will try it again." Then he slept with her. In the
morning he got up early. "This is all right," he said. "This is good. We
will let it be like that." This is how people came to be: deer was the
mother. They made her by means of tobacco, blowing (spitting) it out
while they said what they wished. But the prairie falcon ate nothing but
tobacco. He lived on that. Thus the earth was made.
