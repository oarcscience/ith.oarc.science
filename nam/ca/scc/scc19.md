# 17.--TRUHOHI YOKUTS. THE ORIGIN OF DEATH.

Told by a Tachi Yokuts.

There were two insects, Shoyo and Kokwiteit.\[1\] The latter was a
chief. He, did not want many people to live. He gathered the people and
said: "We will go. I do not know where. We must go somewhere. It will
fill up. It is best if we make it that medicine-men will kill people.
Then there will be a great ceremony for the dead." Coyote liked that.
The others did not like it. Coyote said: "When a chief or one of his
family dies we will go to his village. We will have a great gathering.
We will dance and enjoy ourselves." Then the people liked the idea. But
it was Kokwiteit who was the cause. So now, here in this world, if one
meets a kokwiteit in the road, people say: "There will be too many; let
us kill him." So they kill him. Shoyo did not want people to die, but
Kokwiteit made it that they do.

\[1. C-oyo, nearly Shroyo; the t's in Kokwiteit are palatal, approaching
ch. Kokwiteit resembles the word for raven in other dialects.\]
