# II. THE MYTHS.

## I.--RUMSIEN COSTANOAN. THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD.\[1\]

When this world was finished, the eagle, the humming-bird, and Coyote
were standing on the top of Pico Blanco. When the water rose to their
feet, the eagle, carrying the humming-bird and Coyote, flew to the
Sierra de Gabilan. There they stood until the water went down. Then the
eagle sent Coyote down the mountain to see if the world were dry. Coyote
came back and said: "The whole world is dry." The eagle said to him: "Go
and look in the river. See what there is there." Coyote came back and
said: "There is a beautiful girl." The eagle said: "She will be your
wife in order that people may be raised again." He gave Coyote a digging
implement of abalone shell and a digging stick. Coyote asked: "How will
my children be raised'?" The eagle would not say. He wanted to sec if
Coyote was wise enough to know. Coyote asked him again how these new
people were to be raised from the girl. Then he said: "Well, I will make
them right here in the knee." The eagle said: "No, that is not good."
Then Coyote said: "Well then, here in the elbow." "No, that is not good"
"In the eyebrow." "No, that is not good." "In the back of the neck."
"No, that is not good either. None of these will be good." Then the
humming-bird cried: "Yes, my brother, they are not good. This place will
be good, here in the belly.- Then Coyote was angry. He wanted to kill
him. The eagle raised his wings and the humming-bird flew in his armpit.
Coyote, looked for him in vain. Then the girl said: "What shall I do?
How will I make my children?" The eagle said to Coyote: "Go and marry
her. She will be your wife." Then Coyote went off with this girl. He
said to her: "Louse me." Then the girl found a woodtick on him. She was
afraid and threw it away. Then Coyote seized her. He said: "Look for it,
look for it! Take it! Eat it! Eat my louse!" Then the girl put it in her
mouth. "'Swallow

it, swallow it!" he said. Then she swallowed it and became pregnant.
Then she was afraid. She ran away. She ran through thorns. Coyote ran
after her. He called to her: "Do not run through that brush." He made a
good road for her. But she said: "I do not like this road." Then Coyote
made a road with flowers on each side. Perhaps the girl would stop to
take a flower. She said. "I am not used to going between flowers." Then
Coyote said: "There is no help for it. I cannot stop her." So she ran to
the ocean. Coyote was close to her. Just as he was going to take hold of
her, she threw herself into the water and the waves came up between them
as she turned to a sand flea (or shrimp: camaron). Coyote, diving after
her, struck only the sand. He said: "I wanted to clasp my wife but took
hold of the sand. My wife is gone."
