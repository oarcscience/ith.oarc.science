# 4.--RUMSIEN COSTANOAN. COYOTE AND HIS WIFE.

Makewiks is an animal that lives in the ocean and sometimes comes to the
surface. Coyote went to the ocean with his wife. He told her not to be
afraid. He told her about the sea lion, about the mussels, about the
crabs, and the octopus. He told her that all these were relatives; so
when she saw them she was not afraid. But he did not tell her about the
makewiks. Then when this rose before her it frightened her so that she
fell dead. Coyote took her on his back, carried her off, built a fire,
and laid her by the side of it. He began to sing and dance and jump.
Soon she began to come to life. He jumped three times and brought her to
life.
