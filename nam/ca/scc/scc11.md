# 9.--POHONICHI MIWOK. THE ORIGIN OF DEATH.

Told among the Chukchansi Yokuts.

When the first person died Coyote was south of him, the meadow-lark to
the north. Now the dead person began to stink. The meadow-lark smelled
it. He did not like it. Coyote said: "I think I will make him get up.
The meadow-lark said: "No, do not. There will be too many. They will
become so many that they will eat each other." Coyote said: "That is
nothing. I do not like people to die." But the meadow-lark told him:
"No, it is not well to have too many. There will be others instead of
those that die. A man will have many children. The old people will die
but the young will live." Then Coyote said nothing more. So from that
time on people have always died. Coyote said: "It will be best to put
them into the fire." And so the dead were burned.
