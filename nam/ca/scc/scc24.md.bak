# 22.--TACHI YOKUTS. THE BALD EAGLE AND THE PRAIRIE FALCON.

At a mountain southwest from the north end of Tulare Lake the ground is
red and white. There the bald eagle, owik, lived. He used to take away
men's wives. If they became angry he killed them. The prairie falcon,
limik, lived farther north in the Coast Range with the Tachi. The eagle
took away his wife. Then the prairie falcon pursued him. He fought him.
He broke his head with a rock and killed him. The bald eagle's brains
and blood turned the ground white and red.
