### Formula of Medicine to Insure Long Life for an Infant. <span id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_80.md)

A man lived in the middle of this world all alone. His stool always lay
in the sweat-house. Once when he came in and looked at his stool he was
surprised to see a baby's track near it. The next day when he looked
again he saw it had been playing still more. He studied about it. The
next day he saw it had done that again. After a time he thought be would
watch, so he sat near by. In the morning when he looked he saw it had
been playing with woodpecker heads. The next day again it had been
playing with woodpecker heads, and the next day also. He picked up the
woodpecker head. The third day he picked one up also. When he had
watched nearly four days and the fourth night was nearly passed, well
after midnight he heard a jingling noise. He heard a baby cry. He went
into the house. He saw a baby squirming about. He got a piece of
buckskin, picked up the baby, and wrapped it up in it.

Then, because he did not want to leave it, he put it in his sack and
went away. He went all over the world looking for the herb with which he
was going to make medicine. Finally he went all around the world without
finding it. He came back to the middle of the world where he used to
stay and went into the house without having found the medicine. When he
looked around inside of the house he saw it growing by the wall that
holds the wood, at the very place where the baby was born. Then he
pulled it off and put it under the baby and steamed him with it.

And then the baby grew. Really it grew very fast. Soon it was creeping
about. It seemed very vigorous. After a while it ran about, it was so
strong. He began to study about it. He said to the child, "Lie down and
go to sleep." The child obeyed. The man went away.

He climbed one ridge, and then a second, and a third, and a fourth. When
he got up the fourth ridge be sat down. He looked back where he had left
the baby. He looked this way toward the north. Then he looked toward the
south. After that he looked toward the eastern water's shore. And then
he looked across to the west. Wherever he looked clouds came up.

\[paragraph continues\] As he looked he saw them slide together toward
each other. "He is growing strong," he thought. "What is going to
happen, they are going to come together before me," he thought. Finally
where he used to stay they came together. Just blackness and darkness
hung there. The baby was afraid of that which had happened. Suddenly it
ran up and at once in every direction they drew back. "This way sickness
will be afraid," he thought. And he went back.

The medicine he had made did that. He looked at it thinking, "How will
it be good?" He started home and in time got there. He saw the baby
running about. "I have made the medicine good," he thought. "The
Indians, who are coming to be, will know of me. It will be only a few
who will talk about my medicine. This way those who know my medicine
will do," he thought. "They will place this under the child. This way
they will do. Here across to the north he will hold it up. Here across
to the south, too, he will hold it up. He who knows my formula will do
this way. I made this my medicine for Indians. They will ask me for it.
That which grows in the Indian world \[tobacco\] he will grow with," he
thought. "I will leave something for them. Sickness will be afraid like
this if he puts my medicine under the child. He, who knows my medicine,
will grow in this way to be smart." This way he made it. This way he
finished it.

THE PRAYER.

"Here are ten packages of tobacco with which I ask you for it. Lend me
your medicine. I have not much of that which grows in the Indian world."
"Yes, I guess it is true that you know my formula. I will lend it to
you. There stands my medicine; put it under the child." And then he
blows from his hand the offering of incense root.
