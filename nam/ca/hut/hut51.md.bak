### Formula of Medicine for Green Vomit. <span id="fr_99"></span>[1](#fn_99.md)

The sun, here at the end of the world toward the south, did this. He it
is who always went over the world by day and at night came back home.
The next day he did the same thing again. After a time he listened at
the place they talk about

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

(underworld). He did the same thing the next day. At first he did not
understand what they were saying, but after a time he understood it.

While traveling through the middle of the world, he thought, "I wish I
had a wife. Let something become my wife" He did not find anything which
might be his wife. Finally he thought, "I wish this one we walk on would
be my wife." This that we walk on became his wife. He immediately forgot
the places where he used to listen, so much did he care for the one who
had become his wife.

A child grew in her and she could not move. Soon it would be time for
the movements of the child to begin. By the time it did move she was
like a log. Only her eyes moved about in circles.

Then her husband thought again of the rounds he used to make, which he
had forgotten since he had a wife. "Yes," he thought, "that is the way I
used to do." Then he took up the basket-cup which was on the bank back
of the fire and went out over the world. He did not find the medicine he
sought. "I wonder if Indians are coming into existence," he thought. "It
will be hard for them to have children if they listen at that kind of a
place.

Then he took up the cup again and went down to the river. There he saw
alder roots projecting into the water. They were very beautiful, just
like woodpecker crests sticking out there. "This way it will be when
Indians become," he thought. "However, there will not be many who will
say of me, 'That is the one who did this way.'" And then he made the
medicine in the cup. He picked up a blue-stone <span
id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_100.md) besides. He poured water on the medicine
and carried it with the blue-stone to the house.

When he got there the one in whom the child was moving vomited green
stuff from her mouth. Then he put the blue-stone into the fire. When it
was hot he put it into the cup containing the medicine. As soon as the
medicine was warm he put it into her mouth, and then commenced placing
her in proper position. Before he had her laid as he wished a baby
cried. The one that was

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

born was Yīdetūwiñyai. Once again he arranged her and again a baby
cried. That one came to be "Ground-lies-around." Then he steamed the
babies with the medicine. "This way it will be," he thought, "even if
they listen at that kind of a place."

After midnight, when it began to be light, he heard the babies kicking
in their baskets. "This way it will be with Indians," he thought, "when
they come into existence, if they repeat these words. There will not be
many at all events who will say of me, 'That is the one who did this
way.'" "I guess I did it for Indians," he thought.

Right then they both became men. "Ground-lies-around you are going to
be," he told one of them. "You are going to be Yīdetūwiñyai," he told
the other. "Whoever knows our formula will become smart." And then one
of them went away. It was Yīdetūwiñyai who left them. The father himself
became the sun. To the other one he said, "You will be the one that lies
around the world. Indians are going to live here. You must lie belly
uppermost for the Indians, so they may live happily. If you do not, this
world will tip up on edge."
