At Mount Shasta he grew with his brother. He said to him, "Let us go
visiting." They started out. They came to Nûndilwin*t*ediñ, one of the
Salmon mountains. They fished in the lake with a hook and caught a water
monster. They skinned him and went on.

When they had traveled some way the elder brother said, "You stay here.
I will hide from you." He went on, and when his younger brother came
along he jumped out of the brush dressed in the skin of the water
monster. His brother almost died of fright. "That will answer," he said.

Then they went on until they came to Nadēiltcwûndiñ (Tule ranch). "You
stay here," he said. "I will go on alone." He put on the water monster's
skin. He took two elder sticks and removed the pith. Then he put his
vitals inside of them, slipping one stick over the other.

He went on until he came to Xoñxau*w*diñ (Masten ranch). He went into
the house where two women were sitting. One of them said to him, "You
better go back. This is the place that no one comes in." "No," he said.
After a time he heard the men coming home. One ran in and threw the deer
he was bringing onto the bank back of the fire. Again one ran in. Then

they kept coming in until the ninth had run in. Last of all the head-man
came in. His eye was hot when he looked at him. He pulled out the
fire-like arrow. "Here in my breast shoot me." said the visitor. He shot
him in the breast. It felt very hot where he shot him. The guest jumped
up. He jumped through the smoke-hole. "Stop, give me my arrow-point,"
said the one who shot. He jumped up river and across to the other side.
He took out his vitals. One only of the elder sticks was burned through.
Again he went on jumping along until he came to Nadēiltcwûndiñ. Then
they started toward home.

The wound was so hot he was nearly burned. When they came to Weitchpec
Butte he said, "I wonder how it will be when Indians come." He looked
around and saw something standing <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95.md)
there. He pulled it up and chewed it. He became cold again. "This is the
way it will be," he thought.
