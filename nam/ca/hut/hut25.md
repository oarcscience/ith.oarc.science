# XXII.

### Formula of the Acorn Feast. <span id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59)

Whatever has grown any where in the world in time past let it come back
here. The people must eat but little. If one eats but little he shall
feel as if he had eaten much. Birds must not like the food. Let every
kind come back here which used to grow in the world.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_59"></span>[233:1](hut25.htm#fr_59) This formula is
repeated after the feast is eaten and the people have gone away. The
priest repeats it while standing close over the fire which is renewed to
consume the remains of the feast. See Life and Culture of the Hupa, pp.
80, 81.
