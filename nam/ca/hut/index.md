This is a collection of texts from the Hupa, who lived in Northern
California, Humboldt County, on the Trinity River. The texts are
unfiltered translations of stories related by Hupa at the start of the
20th century in an ethnographic context. They largely take place in a
time before the arrival of human beings, populated by trickster gods and
supernatural beings called Kīxûnai. The texts include a number of
shamanistic formulas for healing, protection and good luck.

The following files contain music notation for songs: [IX](hut12.md),
[XLIV](hut47), and [XLVI](hut49.md).
