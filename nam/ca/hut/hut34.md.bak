### Formula of Medicine for Pregnant Women (Bear's Medicine.) <span id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_72.md)

While walking in the middle of the world Bear got this way. Young grew
in her body. All day and all night she fed. After a while she got so big
she could not walk. Then she began to consider why she was in that
condition, "I wonder if they will be the way I am, in the Indian world?"
She heard someone talking behind her. It said, "Put me in your mouth.
You are in this condition for the sake of Indians."

When she looked around she saw a single plant of redwood sorrel <span
id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_73.md) standing there. She put it into her mouth.
The next day she found she was able to walk. She thought, "It will be
this way in the Indian world with this medicine. This will be my
medicine. At best not many will know about me I will leave it in the
Indian world. They will talk to me with it."
