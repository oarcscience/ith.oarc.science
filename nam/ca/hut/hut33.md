### Formula of Medicine for Pregnant Women (Deer's Medicine.) <span id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_71.md)

They say, deer, you do this way when the young grow in your body. All
day and all night you chew this brush. You drop your young without harm
even in rocky places. You do this way for the sake of people. It is your
medicine that does it. By the use of your medicine it will happen the
same way to me.

1901, by Mary Marshall.

The formula is said to the growing shrub, *Ceanothus integerrimus*. The
tender shoots are then taken and chewed. The practice is followed during
the first three months of the term to keep the fœtus of moderate size.
