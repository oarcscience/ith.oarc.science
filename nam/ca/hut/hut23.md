### Daily Prayer of the Priest at the Jumping Dance. <span id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md)

It will be pleasant weather everywhere in the world. The clouds which
used to be, will be no more. Everything will be as it should be. The
good food will come again; it will grow again. By means of it the people
will live happily. This sickness which the people used to have they will
have no more. This that the people used to be sick with, blow out to sea
with you, O, wind.
