### Formula of a Deer Medicine. <span id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_89.md)

A Kīxûnai lived in the middle of this world. He came into existence just
before the coming of Indians. "How will it be," he thought, "when
Indians come into existence and a miñkilen eats of the venison they have
killed?" Then it happened that a woman in such a condition did eat of
venison which he had killed. He went out to hunt and walked about until
night without seeing a deer. He heard someone say to him, "It has
happened because a miñkilen has eaten of your venison." "How will it
be?" thought the Kīxûnai. When he looked around he saw buck brush <span
id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90.md) growing there. He took some of the leaves
and tender shoots, pounded them up, and rubbed them on himself.

When he went out to hunt the next morning two deer came toward him. He
killed them. "This way it will happen to that one of the Indians who
shall know my medicine. Not many of them shall know my medicine. It will
be well with the one who knows it. I wish that he may have no trouble in
killing deer."
