### Formula of Woman's Love Medicine. <span id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_83.md)

The young men of the Kīxûnai used to come to a certain rock that stands
in the ocean at the mouth of the Klamath. They used to hold there their
sports and shooting matches. But notwithstanding all the attractions, a
modest woman lived there who never went out of her house. Once, while
she was sitting working on her baskets, a beam of sunlight fell on her
without cause. "What is going to happen?" she thought. As she was going
on with her weaving, she noticed a person coming in. "Up there is the
place they go in," she said. "The Kīxûnai who live around here never
come in this house."

The one who came in, came intending to be the woman's husband. He lived
there for a time and then he went away and never returned. She heard no
longer the sound of the games and the talk of the Kīxûnai.

Mink came to her, one time, and said, "You won't see again the one who
used to come here. Across the ocean to the south he has two wives. One
lies in each of his arms." When she had found out this, she was more
lonesome than ever. She went outside. "When Indians come," she thought,
"they will do this way." She used to go outside and look in vain for the
herb with which she was to make the medicine. She looked all over the
world for it.

Once she was surprised to see that as the lonesomeness fell upon her,
the herb grew. It came into the world with lonesomeness. She looked at
the ground and saw the herb growing there. She pulled off part of it and
took it into the house with her. She bathed her arms and legs with it,
and when it was night lay down with some of it in her hand and a bundle
of it behind her. In the middle of the night she took the bundle up and
put it in front of her.

Then speaking to it she said, "If ten times his heart goes from me to
other women, finally it will come back to me. I hope he may be crazy.
How many soever women he likes, even if they lie in his arms, this
medicine will come to him. Among how many soever of them he goes, this
my heart will find him."

The noise of the Kīxûnai was quiet. She did not hear their talk. "This
way it will be," she thought. "You will hate the one you used to like.
Before all others you will think about me. It will be this way in the
Indian world, if they do this." When she got up in the morning, she put
the bundle of medicine toward the north. When the sun was just here it
shone upon her. "This way it will be," she thought, "if Indians when
they come, make medicine. But there will not be many who will make it,"
she thought. "I have made it good," she thought. "This way it will be."
It went even on him and he came back to her. It was the moon who
discarded her.
