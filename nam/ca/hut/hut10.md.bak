### Xonsadiñ Kûntcūwiltcwil. <span id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32.md)--Xonsadiñ Young Man.

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

A young man who was living at Xonsadiñ said to a young man living at
Miskût, "Let us go visiting." "Very well," said the Miskût young man.
"Tomorrow then we will meet at NiLûtkalai," said the Xonsadiñ young man.

The next morning the Miskût young man climbed the hill to NiLûtkalai and
examined the trail. Seeing no tracks he said to himself, "He has not
gone along yet." He sat down in the brush and waited. After a long time
he saw a wolf coming up the trail. It came up, and climbed a hollow
stump that was standing there. Soon it put its face out and looked
about. The Miskût young man then saw it was the one with whom he was to
travel. He saw him come down the stump holding something in front of
himself. He went along the trail a little way past him and sat down to
wait. "I have been here along time," he told the Miskût young man when
he came along. "No," said the Miskût young man, "I came ahead of you.
How you were dressed when you climbed that tree!" "Don't say that," he
said. "We will visit people with it."

After they had been travelling sometime the Xonsadiñ young man said,
"Come, dress up in it." <span id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33.md) He put it on
him but the Miskût young man could do nothing with it. He did not know
how to use it. They went on to the mouth of Redwood creek and camped.
When it was dark the Xonsadiñ young man said, "You stay here. I will go
to the house." He dressed himself in the wolf skin and loped away. At
dawn he came running

back. "I looked at a man," he said. In the morning they went on. When
they came to the village they were told that a man had died. The
Xonsadiñ young man went into the house. He pretended to be so overcome
with grief that he actually rolled about on the floor. "Yesterday he was
all right," they said, "then in the middle of the night he suddenly came
upon a man. He had a headache and died."

When they had finished the burial, the Xonsadiñ young man said, "Come,
let us go home." "Even as it is, you may stay," they said. "No, I will
not stay overnight, I am too lonesome for my dead friend," he said. They
went back a way and camped. After dark the Xonsadiñ young man said, "I
will go back,--no, you go back." "I am afraid," said the Miskût man.
Nevertheless his friend put the wolf skin on him. "Now go on, run," he
told him. He did not know how. Then his friend showed him. "Here do it
this way." He went back. When he came to the grave he looked about. He
heard them eating in the house. Then he tore away the fence which was
about the grave and began to take down the things which were hung above
it. He had only secured a few articles when he heard someone coming. He
started to run but was nearly caught before he thought of the
kitdōñxoi <span id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34.md) which he had. He touched
that and then he nearly flew. When he came where his companion was
sitting he said, "They nearly caught me."

Then the Xonsadiñ young man put on the wolf skin and ran back. Soon he
came again. He had taken everything away from the grave. The next
morning they went home. The Xonsadiñ young man said, "We will own it
together; with it we will go visiting."

skin.
