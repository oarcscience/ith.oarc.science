### The Coming of White Men. <span id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43)

It was winter when they heard they were coming from the south. "Let us
make a dance or do something else," they said. "Something is coming."
Then they heard that they had already reached Southfork. Southfork men
ran down to Medildiñ and told them that the strangers did no harm. They
came down to Medildiñ and camped for the night on the other side above
the village. There they bought bear, fox, and coon hides, giving
hatchets and knives for them. They came down here to Sau*w*titcdiñ and
camped on the north side of the creek. We ran away from them down into
the cañon. They went on and spent the next night at Bloody camp. Then
they say they went on crossing Pine creek at Martin's Perry. They went
over the Bald Hills coming out to the ocean at the mouth of the Klamath.

Three or four years after that they heard a boat had come in at
Trinidad. A Bald Hill Indian ran over and reported that something was
coming. They camped at French camp. Then they came here. They bought
otter-skins with blue beads. They went on this way up the river.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_43"></span>[198:1](hut16.htm#fr_43) Told at Hupa, July
1902, by McCann, a white-haired old man who was born and has always
lived at the northern end of the valley near the beginning, of the
cañon. He said that he was at this time about as large as his grandson
who is probably 10 years old. He appears now to be between 70 and 75
years of age.
