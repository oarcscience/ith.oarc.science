### Formula of Medicine to Cause the Infant to Grow Fast. <span id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_77.md)

Here in the eastern corner of the world grew a maiden by herself. She
lived all alone, seeing no one. After a time without cause she became
pregnant. She had seen no one. She had not even seen the tracks of
people. "From whom have I a child," she kept thinking. After a while the
time for her to be sick had nearly come. Finally she was sick and gave
birth to a baby. "I will pick up that baby," she thought. When she tried
to pick it up it dodged from her. Many times she tried to pick it up but
it eluded her until finally it fell down from the world above. When it
had crawled near the beach across toward the west it stopped. Where it
stopped the medicine grew. She broke off some of it and with that picked
up the baby. That which grew at the place toward which he crawled became
the medicine. She took him back to the eastern corner where she steamed
him with it. The medicine was wild ginger. <span
