# XII.

### Origin of Fire. <span id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md)

It was the Old-man-across-the-ocean. He picked up stones and struck them
together. Nothing [happened](errata.htm#0.md). Then he picked up a willow
root and whittled it down to the dry part. He bored holes in it and then
setting [another](errata.htm#1.md) stick in one of the holes, rolled it,
between his hands. He was surprised to see smoke come out. Soon fire
rolled out. That was the way it [happened](errata.htm#2.md). They do that
way now.
