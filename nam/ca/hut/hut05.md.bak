An old woman was living with her granddaughter, a virgin, at
Kintcū*w*h*w*ikût. The girl used to go to dig roots and her grandmother
used to say to her "You must not dig those with two stocks." The girl
wondered why she was always told that. One morning she thought, "I am
going to dig one," so she went across the river to Tceindīqōtdiñ and
began digging. She thought, "I am going to take out one with a double
stock." When she had dug it out she heard a baby cry. She ran back to
the river, and when she got there she heard someone crying "mother"
after her. She jumped into the boat and pushed it across. When she got
across, the baby had tumbled down to the other shore. She ran up to the
house and there she heard it crying on that side. She ran into the
house, then she heard it crying back of the house. At once she sat down
and then she heard it tumble on the roof of the house. The baby tumbled
through the smoke-hole and then rolled about on the floor. The old woman
jumped up and put it in a baby basket. The young woman sat with her back
to the fire and never looked at the child.

The old woman took care of the baby alone. After a time it commenced to
sit up and finally to walk. When he was big enough to shoot, the old
woman made a bow and he began to kill birds. Afterward he killed all
kinds of game; and, because his mother never looked at him, he gave
whatever he killed to his grandmother. Finally he became a man. The
young woman had been in the habit of going out at dawn and not returning
until dark. She brought back with her acorns as long as her finger. One
time the young man thought "I am going to watch and see where she goes."
The young woman had always said to herself, "If he will bring acorns
from the place I bring them, and if he will kill a white deer, I will
call him my son."

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Early one morning the son saw his mother come
out of the house and start up the ridge. He followed her and saw her go
along until she came to a dry tree. She climbed this and it grew with
her to the sky. The young man then returned saying, "Tomorrow I am going
up there." The woman came home at night with the usual load of long
acorns.

The next morning the man went the way his mother had gone, climbed the
tree as he had seen her do, and it grew with him to the sky. When he
arrived there he saw a road. He followed that until he came to an oak,
which he climbed, and waited to see what would happen. Soon he heard
laughing girls approaching. They came to the tree and began to pick
acorns from allotted spaces under it. The young man began to throw down
acorns. "That's right Blue Jay," said one of the girls. Then another
said, "It might be Dug-from-the-ground. You can hardly look at him, they
say, he is so handsome." Two others said, "Oh, I can look at him, I
always look at this walking one (pointing to the sun) that is the one
you can hardly look at." He came down from the tree and passed between
the girls. The two who had boasted they could look at him, turned their
faces to the ground. The other two who had thought they could not look
him in the face were able to do so.

The young man killed the deer, the killing of which the mother had made
the second condition for his recognition as a son. He then filled the
basket from his mother's place under the tree and went home. When the
woman saw him with the acorns as long as one's finger, she called him
her son.

After a time he said, "I am going visiting." "All right," said the
grandmother, and then she made for him a bow and arrows of blue-stone,
and a shinny stick and sweat-house wood of the same material. These he
took and concealed by putting them under the muscles of his forearm. He
dressed himself for the journey and set out. He went to the home of the
immortals at the edge of the world toward the east. When he got down to
the shore on this side they saw him. One of them took out the canoe of
red obsidian and stretched it until it was the proper size. He launched
it and came across for him. When he had landed, the young man placed his
hand on the bow and as he

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

did so, the boat gave a creak, he was so strong. When they had crossed
he went to the village. In the middle of it he saw a house of blue-stone
with a pavement in front of black obsidian. He went in and heard one
say, "It is my son-in-law for whom I had expected to be a long time
looking." When the sun had set there came back from different places ten
brothers. Some had been playing kiñ, <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md)
some had been playing shinny, some had been hunting, some spearing
salmon, and others had been shooting at a mark. Eagle and Panther were
both married to daughters of the family. They said to him, "You here,
brother-in-law?" "Yes," he said, "I came a little while ago." When it
was supper time they put in front of him a basket of money's meat, <span
id="fr_23"></span>[2](#fn_23.md) which mortal man cannot swallow. He ate
two baskets of it and they thought he must be a smart man. After they
had finished supper they all went to the sweat-house to spend the night.
At midnight the young man went to the river to swim. There he heard a
voice say, "The sweat-house wood is all gone." Then Mink told him that
men could not find sweat-house wood near by, but that some was to be
found to the southeast. They called to him for wood from ten
sweat-houses and he said "Yes" to all. Mink told him about everything
they would ask him to do. <span id="fr_24"></span>[3](#fn_24.md) He went
back to the sweat-house and went in. When the east whitened with the
dawn, he went for sweat-house wood as they had told him. He came to the
place where the trail forks and one of them turns to the northeast and
the other to the southeast. There he drew out from his arm the wood his
grandmother had provided him with and split it fine. He made this into
ten bundles and carried them back to the village. When he got there he
put them down carefully but the whole earth shook with the shock. He
carried a bundle to each sweat-house. They all sweated themselves. He
spent the day there and at evening went again to the sweat-house. When
he went to the river to swim, Mink met him again and told him that the
next day they would play shinny.

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

After they were through breakfast the next morning, they said, "Come,
brother-in-law, let us go to the place where they play shinny." They all
went and after placing their bets began to play. Twice they were beaten.
Then they said, "Come, brother-in-law, play." They passed him a stick.
He pressed down on it and broke it. "Let me pick up something," he said.
He turned about and drew out his concealed shinny stick and the balls.
Then he stepped out to play and Wildcat came to play against him. The
visitor made the stroke and the balls fell very near the goal. Then he
caught Wildcat smashing his face into its present shape, and threw the
ball over the line. He played again, this time with Fox. Again he made
the stroke and when he caught Fox he pinched his face out long as it has
been ever since. He then struck the ball over the line and won. The next
time he played against Earthquake. The ground opened up a chasm but he
jumped over it. Earthquake threw up a wall of bluestone but he threw the
ball through it. "Dol" it rang as it went through. Then he played with
Thunder. It rained and there was thunder. It was the running of that one
which made the noise. It was then night and he had won back all they had
lost. There were ten strings of money, besides otterskins, fisherskins,
and blankets.

The next day they went to shoot at the white bird which Indians can
never hit. The others commenced to shoot and then they said to their
guest, "Come, you better shoot." They gave him a bow, which broke when
he drew it. Then he pulled out his own and said, "I will shoot with this
although the nock has been cut down and it is not very good." They
thought, "He can't hit anything with that." He shot and hit the bird,
and dentalia fell all about. They gathered up the money and carried it
home.

The Hupa man went home to his grandmother at Kintcū*w*h*w*ikût. As many
nights as it seemed to him he had spent, so many years he had really
been away. He found his grandmother lying by the fire. Both of the women
had been worried about him. He said to them, "I have come back for you."
"Yes," they said, "we will go." Then he repaired the house, tying it up
anew with hazel withes. He poked a stick under it and away it went to
the end of the world toward the east, where he had married. They are
living there yet.
