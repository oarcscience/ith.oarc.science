### The Coming of White Men. <span id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44)

When they first came along with a pack-train we ran away and hid. They
came up on to the flat cast of Medildiñ and went around among the houses
of the village. They began to buy Manzanita flour with small blue beads.
Those with brave hearts traded with them. Some of us ran away from them.
The babies were hid in the storage baskets. They went across the river
south of Medildiñ and camped for the night. They came back the next day
and traded hatchets for the native dogs which they ate. After remaining
only one night they went up the river with their train.

1902, by the wife of Dan Miskût. She was born at Medildiñ and lived
there until her marriage. She appears to be about 75 years old. Her
younger brother at the time of this incident was a small child. He was
hid in a storage basket. He now has the appearance of a man of 65 or 70
years.
