<P>"I come to you who have made your abode at Xaslindi&ntilde;. They say you are the smartest of all. I am suffering from that evil (death) which has been left to us of the Indian world. The people are afraid of me. I do not have a fire where the others have their fire. I have a fire by myself. And besides, what the rest eat I do not eat. Furthermore, I do not look at the world. So much my body frightens them. I am telling you that you may be sorry for me."</P>
<P>"Yes, I saw his spirit running down on the other side of the river with the string tied around his head. No, I am not the one. I will tell you who is the smartest, but that which makes the Indian happy (tobacco) you must leave for me. Hurry and go on to him who sits across the river from Djicta&ntilde;adi&ntilde;."</P>
<P>(The priest calls up in a similar manner the spirits who live at the following places: Djicta&ntilde;adi&ntilde;, Tseyekex&#333;x&#363;<I>w</I>, Xonsadi&ntilde;.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_358"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 358</FONT></A></P>
<P>At each of these places he receives a reply similar to the one given above. At Xonsadi&ntilde; he is told to go to the one who dwells below on the other side of the river. There he calls as at the former places. The reply is as follows:)</P>
<P>"Yes, I think so. I saw a spirit running down on the other side toward the north, his head tied around with a string. I heard the wailing of the Indians, then I ran away carrying with me my medicine, by means of which my heart is made sorrowful for them. I will give it to you. Bathe yourself with it. You will live among the people, but go on; hurry up. Give me that which makes the Indian feel happy. Go to him who dwells at X&#333;t&#363;waik&ucirc;t."</P>
<P>(In the same manner the priest calls upon the spirits who dwell at X&#333;t&#363;waik&ucirc;t, Tcwitcnani&ntilde;adi&ntilde;, Tsen&#333;&ntilde;adi&ntilde; tan&#275;djit, Ky&#363;weLedi&ntilde;, KiLw&#275;di&ntilde;. Calling at the latter place he receives the usual reply and is told to go on to the old woman who dwells at TseLtcedi&ntilde;:)</P>
<P>Ha&nbsp;ha&nbsp;ha&nbsp;ha. Ha&nbsp;ha&nbsp;ha&nbsp;ha.</P>
<P>"I come to you old woman who dwell at TseLtcedi&ntilde;" (The address is finished as in former cases.)</P>
<P>"Yes, I will tell you who is the smartest. Call to the one who dwells north, just below M&ucirc;kanad&#363;w&ucirc;ladi&ntilde;.</P>
<P>Ha&nbsp;ha&nbsp;ha&nbsp;ha. Ha&nbsp;ha&nbsp;ha&nbsp;ha.</P>
<P>"No, he does not hear me."</P>
<P>Ha&nbsp;ha&nbsp;ha&nbsp;ha. Ha&nbsp;ha&nbsp;ha&nbsp;ha.</P>
<P>"Now he hears me. I have come to you, M&ucirc;kanad&#363;w&ucirc;ladi&ntilde;. I am in the sorrowful condition which has been left for those of the Indian world. I have been in vain to all these nine places. At each they have told me that someone else is the smartest. The Indians are afraid of me. I do not build my fire where the Indians build theirs. I have a fire by myself. That which the Indians eat I do not eat. Besides I do not look at the world. This much they fear me. I am telling you that you may feel sorry for me."</P>
<P>"Yes, I hear you. Do not be too much frightened. You will travel again in the Indian world. Your body will be renewed. I will loan you this my medicine. You shall hunt and the deer will lie still for you. It shall be the same in regard to dentalia.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Now look at the shrub which stands outside by my house. As soon as it is dark, it grows up tall. To-morrow in the morning it will be eaten down. The deer will come to feed upon it. Look at this too which stands back of the fire. The dentalia eat it down, but it grows up again at the break of day. It comes to my mind that it will be that way with you. I will loan it to you. There will not be many who will know the formula by means of which my mind is made to feel sorry for them. Take this medicine of mine with you. Leave for me that which makes the Indian feel happy.</P>
<P>(Said by the priest to the recipient as the medicine is applied to him). Now your body will be renewed. You will be as the other Indians are. Already your body is renewed. It will be less heavy upon you. Everything will be easy for you to get. You will possess dentalia."</P>
