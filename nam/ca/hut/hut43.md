Snipe lived across to the south. His canoe was very narrow. It was so
shallow it did not come above his ankle. "I am going in it," he thought.
"How is it going to be?" he thought. He took the paddles out of the
house and went down to the river. He got into his canoe and then he got
out again. He turned the canoe around. He placed it with the stern
toward the land. "Indians are going to come into existence," he thought.
"They will think about me with this." He held it with the stern toward
the land, headed this way across the river and down stream. "There must
not be many," he thought, "who will say of me, 'That one I hear did this
way."' Then he went into the

canoe, beat on the stern with the paddle, and sang. When he started
across, his canoe grew up higher, and floated with him over the world.
The boat did not mind the water. It floated with him over this body of
water which lies around the world. He sang a song as he went along. It
floated back with him across to the south. "It will do that way with the
man who knows my medicine," he thought. "Even if he goes into a bad
place, if he thinks about me, this way the water will not trouble his
boat."
