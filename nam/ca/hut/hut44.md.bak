### Formula of Medicine for Going Among Rattlesnakes. <span id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_87.md)

While at Tcexōltcwediñ Yīmantūwiñyai felt dissatisfied with something.
"How will the people live?" he thought. He started out and walked up
along the Klamath. When the sun went down, rattlesnakes which had wings
flew about. He looked about as he went along and thought, "What kind of
medicine shall I make?" He saw a bush of Philadephus <span
id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_88.md) standing there. He broke off a shoot, made
rings around it, and used it for a cane. "When I come to Lōknasaûndiñ,
that lies ahead of me," he thought, "I will whip the air with it." When
he came out into the prairie at Lōknasaûndiñ he whipped about himself
with the cane. He found nothing there. He had killed them all
immediately. "This is the way it will happen," he thought. " if any one
takes my cane along. He will go through dangerous places if he carries
my cane, and he will not see rattlesnakes."
