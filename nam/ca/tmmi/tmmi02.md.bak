### PICTORIAL REPRESENTATIONS.

The following creation story of the Luiseño of Pauma is only a fragment,
sufficient, however, to add a new version to those already known, and
sufficient to bring out the most important qualities of the origin
traditions of this region. It is accompanied also by a feature of
special ethnographic interest: a pictorial representation of the
personified world. Crude as this is, it is enough to suggest the
ritualistic and symbolic painting of the Southwest, and it is of
particular importance on account of the absence of anything
corresponding among the Indians of Central and northern California. Not
only do

these latter Indians not make use of such ceremonial representations,
but their whole life is remarkably deficient in all forms of graphic or
pictorial art and imitation. The idea of representing anything by a
drawing is foreign to the make-up of their minds. Even to-day, after
living in the midst of civilization for over half a century, the older
people are utterly at a loss if called upon to execute a picture of any
sort. In many cases this extends even to map-like representations of the
country with which they are familiar. A Californian Indian asked to
sketch upon the ground a representation of the river system with which
he is acquainted, either professes himself unable to do so, or, as has
been the experience of the author, in some cases draws a number of marks
or scratches which upon inquiry turn out to be nothing but a sort of
score or tally of the names given, without any idea of an indication of
spatial relations. Simple and awkward as is the figure drawn by old
Pachito of Pauma and here reproduced, it nevertheless reveals a trend of
ideas and practices entirely foreign to the Indians of northern
California. A step farther in the direction of resemblances to the
Southwest is found in the colored earth paintings of ceremonial import,
the occurrence of which among the Mission Indians has been noticed, and
to which, fortunately, Miss Du Bois has recently been able to give
special study. It is clear that the difference in this respect between
the Indians of southern California and those of the larger northern part
of the State is culturally, that is to say historically, very
deep-going, for southern California, like the Southwest and the Great
Basin, abounds in carved and painted rocks, whereas the whole northern
part of the State from Shasta to Tehachapi, with scattering exceptions
along the borders, is one of the few areas in North America which are
free from any trace of petrographs. It is therefore clear that the bulk
of the California Indians not only do not execute pictorial
representations for religious purposes at the present time, but that
their ancestors or predecessors in their present sites did not do so,
whereas the Indians of southern California both make such
representations now and have done so in the past.
