The Shoshone (also spelled Shoshoni) are Native Americans of the Great
Basin region, and south and east of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.
Shoshoneans are distributed widely--from Southern California, Death
Valley and Mono Lake, through Utah to Western Colorado. Sacajawea, the
woman who guided the Lewis and Clark expedition, was a Utah Shoshone.

While the beliefs of other Shoshonean tribes are fairly well documented,
there is little published information about the mythology of the Great
Basin Shoshone per se. This collection reveals that the Western
Shoshone, who lived in central Nevada, were very similar to the Northern
Californians in this regard. Their myths are inhabited by the lusty
trickster Coyote, and other primordial zoomorphic demigods.
