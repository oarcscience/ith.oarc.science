### THE LENGTH OF WINTER; COYOTE IS BITTEN

(Saline Valley, California. Shoshoni)

Coyote, Owl, and Whippoorwill (To’ovego) were making the year. Coyote
was fixing the length of winter. Coyote said, "It should

have as many months as the hairs on my back." Owl said, "No, it should
have as many months as my feathers." "No, there are too many feathers
and hairs," Whippoorwill said, "it should be 4 months." He flew away
singing, "Watsa mu’a (4 months)."

Coyote became angry, and ran after Whippoorwill, but could not catch
him. While Coyote was following Whippoorwill, he came to some red
berries (puhupuhya). As he sat eating them, a rattlesnake bit him. He
wanted to tell somebody that he had been bitten. He found a man, and
told him to tell the people. The man went a short distance and came
back. Next time he went farther and camp, back. He kept doing this until
he finally got tired. Coyote died while the man was going back and
forth.
