### COYOTE LEARNS TO FLY

(Big Smoky Valley, Nevada. Shoshoni)

Goose said to Coyote, "I'll give you wings. See those two sharp
mountains? One is farther away. If I give you wings, you can fly up to
that hill." Coyote said, "All right."

Goose pulled some of his feathers out and stuck them along Coyote's arms
and said, "If you fly, sit on that mountain and wait for me. Don't go
away. I will watch you." Goose sat down to watch. Coyote said, "All
right," and went, saying "Wa’ wa’ wa’." He felt good. He said, "I don't
want to sit on that hill. I feel good." He flew a long way and fell
down.

Goose was watching him and found him. He went to Coyote and broke his
head. Coyote's brains ran out and he died.

When he came to life he felt his brains and said. "My nephews gave me
some mush." He ate some. Then he found that his head was broken and that
he had been eating his own brains. He vomited. Goose came and found him
and said, "You are bad, adabu!" He took his wings away from Coyote and
left him.

Coyote cried. He did not know what to do.
