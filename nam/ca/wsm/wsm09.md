### THE ORIGIN OF PEOPLE

(Panamint Valley, California. Shoshoni)

The earth was covered with water. The water dried up quickly. At this
time the birds and animals were men.

Coyote was walking along the Panamint Mountains, when he saw a very
beautiful woman who had very white skin. Her name was pabon' posiats,
"tan louse." She was carrying a jug of water. Coyote followed her, and
when he came up to her, he said, "I am very thirsty. Give me a drink of
water." She pointed to a place (about one-half a mile away) and told him
to go over there, and she would give him a drink. Coyote did so. When
she came up to him, she again pointed to a distant place and told him to
go there. In this way she continued to put him off until they reached
her home.

The girl lived with her mother. The mother said to her, "Where did you
get him?" Coyote went to some water and started to drink. While he was
drinking the girl tried to strike him several times, but Coyote dodged
each time. Then she said to him, "You go into the house," pointing to a
big hole in the house. Coyote went in, and saw many bows and arrows
around the walls of the house. <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md)

During the night Coyote's advances toward the women were
frustrated <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) . . . In the morning Coyote
asked the woman who owned the bows and arrows. She told him to take them
and to hunt some ducks. That day Coyote killed ducks and caught fish,
which he brought back to the house.

In the evening the women cooked the ducks. They ate some and disposed of
some . . .

That night Coyote made advances to both the girl and her mother . . . By
morning the girl's belly was large. She began to bear children, putting
them into a large basketry water jug. She told Coyote that they were his
babies. When Coyote was ready to leave, the girl said to him, "Carry the
babies in the jug. These babies will cry for water, but you must be
careful. If you give them water, open the stopper only a little or they
will get out." She showed him how to give them water.

Coyote started out carrying the jug, which was very heavy. As he went
along, the babies cried, "I want water. I am dry!" Coyote said, "They
are thirsty; maybe they will die." Coyote opened the

jug, and the babies all ran out. They went in all directions. <span

and arrows. These people became the different Indian tribes.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_7"></span>[261:8](wsm09.htm#fr_7.md) The inference is that
these weapons belonged to men who had previously visited her and whom
she had killed.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[261:9](wsm09.htm#fr_8.md) In this and in subsequent
versions of this tale, the familiar vagina dentatum theme is used to
explain the failure of Coyote's amorous advances. Coyote remedies the
situation by using a piece of wood or mountain sheep neck. The theme
also is made to account for the disposition of part of the food eaten by
the women. Deletions of this material are indicated by dots.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[262:10](wsm09.htm#fr_9.md) G. H. added that some
paper was lost at this time, implying that the Indians had known how to
write, but that the art was lost when Coyote opened the jug.
