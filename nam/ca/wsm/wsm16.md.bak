### THE RACE TO KOSO HOT SPRINGS

(Saline Valley, California. Shoshoni)

All the animals were down south somewhere (pitiwana). All of them--Crow,
Badger, Lizard, Coyote, the birds--were racing against Sun. Frog was in
the lead, and reached Koso Hot Springs before Sun. When he got there, he
waited for the other animals to arrive.

When all the animals had arrived, they built a large house for all the
people. They all went into the house and left Coyote to throw

\[paragraph continues\] Sun in the fire. Before Coyote did this, he
looked carefully to see where the house was. Then he threw Sun into the
fire and all became dark. This is why the springs are hot now.

Coyote set out for the house in the darkness, but could not find it. He
searched all over for it. He wandered around for a year. He was very
thin by this time.

The people in the house began to talk about Coyote. They said he was the
smartest of them all; they wanted him. They began to look for him, and
found him close by. It was springtime. Coyote was very thin. The people
brought him into the house and gave him a corner in which to rest.

The people wanted Sun back. They asked each other how they could get Sun
again. Mallard Duck said, "Quack, quack, quack," and every animal made
his noise, trying to bring Sun back. When Mallard quacked, a little
light, like dawn, began to show. They asked Coyote to make his noise;
when he did so it went dark again. Duck quacked again, and it began to
get light. The third time Duck quacked, Sun came out. The people saw
that it was springtime; everything was green. They went out of the
house.

Sun was close to the earth. They killed him, took his gall out, and
threw it high in the sky.
