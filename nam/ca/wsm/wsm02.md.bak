# SOME WESTERN SHOSHONI MYTHS

## By JULIAN H. STEWARD

### INTRODUCTION

These myths were procured from several Shoshoni of Nevada and eastern
California and from one Northern Paiute during 6 months' ethnographic
field work <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) in 1935. They by no means
exhaust the western Shoshoni mythological repertory, but, as this
enormous area has heretofore been a blank on the ethnographic map, any
material from it should be recorded.

The myths were recorded from the following localities and informants:
Saline Valley, between Death Valley and Owens Valley, Calif.; Patsie
Wilson, Shoshoni (now at Lone Pine), age about 50, informant; Andrew
Gleim, interpreter. Panamint Valley, Calif.; George Hansen, age about
90. Upper Death Valley, Calif.; Bill Doe, Shoshoni (now at Beatty,
Nev.), age about 70. Beatty, Nev.; Tom Stewart, Shoshoni, age about 70.
Ash Meadows, Nev., where Shoshoni and Southern Paiute were somewhat
mixed, but myths claimed to be Shoshoni; Mary Scott, age about 80. Lida,
Nev.; John Shakespeare (now living at Cow Camp, near Silver Peak, Nev.),
Shoshoni, age about 80. Big Smoky Valley, Nev.; Jenny Kawich (now living
at Shurz, Nev.), Shoshoni, age about 65; these myths poorly remembered
and very synoptic. Smith Valley, Nev., Tom Horn, Shoshoni, age about 60.
Elko, Nev.; Bill Gibson, Shoshoni, age about 60. Winnemucca, Nev.;
Charlie Thacker, Northern Paiute (now living at Owyhee, Nev.), age about
70. One myth is from the Gosiute (who are really Shoshoni), procured in
1936 while doing field work for the Bureau of American Ethnology;
informant, Müdiwak, age about 60.

There are few tales in this collection that are actually new. The
themes, episodes, characters, and style are very similar to myths from
Owens Valley and western Nevada, Paiute, from Owens Valley Shoshoni,
from Ute and Southern Paiute, and from the Northern Lemhi
Shoshoni. <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) Novelty lies only in local
combinations of widespread

elements and in local embellishment. Therefore, as the most interesting
feature of Shoshonean mythology is local variation, an effort was made
to obtain different versions of the same tale. From this standpoint, I
was most successful in the Origin of People, procuring seven variants
from as many localities. The Theft of Fire, the Theft of Pine Nuts,
Coyote Learns to Fly, and Cottontail Shoots the Sun are also popular,
wide-spread themes. The Race to Koso Hot Springs is an Owens Valley
Paiute favorite. Other myths were collected at random.

Personal songs, sung by prominent myth characters, as in Owens Valley
tales, seem to have been a general, though not important, feature of
Shoshoni myths, but no effort was made to collect them.
