### RAT AND MOUNTAIN SHEEP

(Saline Valley, California. Shoshoni)

Rat (Kawa) had a home on the top of a mountain, <span
id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md) where he was building a dance corral.
When he finished the corral, he went out to hunt Mountain Sheep.

Rat stood on a mountain, calling in his own language, "Nikadawa piwiavi,
nikadawa piwiavi," inviting the Mountain Sheep to come join his circle
dance and have a big feast. The Mountain Sheep answered
"Hoho'’<sup>o</sup>." That night the Sheep came to his dance. When they
arrived, Rat began to sing his circle dance song in a monotone:

He picked out the largest of the [Mountain](errata.htm#0.md) Sheep and said
to him, "You are my friend. I want to dance close to you." Then he said
to all the Mountain Sheep, "Carry your babies with you on your backs
while you are dancing." He told them all to shut their eyes while they
were dancing. Rat sang his dance song and they danced all night. When it
was nearly morning, while the people had their eyes shut, Rat stabbed
the big Mountain Sheep that was dancing next to him. He killed him. Then
Rat shouted, "Who killed that man? It must have been a Wavitc." <span
id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md) The people opened their eyes and looked
around. They all began to cry. Rat leaned his head on his hand and said,
(crying in a falsetto) "Tana ho nano ho' budi." Then Rat said to the
people, "Well, you people can go home now. I'll put this man into a fire
and burn him up. After that, I will go home."

The Mountain Sheep went home. When they were gone, Rat, who was left
alone, skinned Mountain Sheep and dried all the meat.

When Rat had eaten all his meat, he went out again and called the
Mountain Sheep as before. Again they answered and came down to

his dance that night. He told the biggest one to dance close to him and
the others to dance with their babies on their backs and their eyes
closed. But this time the Mountain Sheep said, "It is probably Rat who
is doing this. Tell the children to watch him while we dance." The
children watched Rat while they danced and saw him stab the Mountain
Sheep next to him. Then Rat ran for his bow and said, "Where is the
Wavitc who is doing this stabbing?" After the people had left, Rat
cooked the Mountain Sheep he had stabbed.

When Rat had no more meat, he went into the mountains and called the
Mountain Sheep as before. They answered and came down to his dance.
Again he asked the biggest one to dance beside him and told the others
to carry their babies and keep their eyes closed. But while they were
dancing, the Mountain Sheep next to Rat stabbed him in the belly. Rat
ran away and the people ran after him. They looked for him in his hole
but could not find him. While they were looking, they found Mountain
Sheep meat that he had dried.
