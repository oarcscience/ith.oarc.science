### THE ORIGIN OF PEOPLE

(Smith Valley, Nevada. Shoshoni)

All the birds and animals were men. Yellowhammer and the others went to
where some people up north had pine nuts. They had put their pine nuts
in a deer-skin bag, hung high up on a white pine tree. Coyote's people
played the hand game and other games with them. They played for many
days and nights. They wanted the pine nuts. Mouse hunted, hunted, and
hunted for the pine nuts, but did not see any. The people still played
the hand game. Finally, Mouse found the deer-hide bag full of pine nuts
hanging in the tree.

That night all the owners of the pine nuts went to sleep. During the
night, Coyote and his people tried to get the pine nuts down. Coyote
jumped, but he could not jump high enough. All the others tried, but
none of them could jump high enough. Then Coyote asked Woodpecker to
try. Woodpecker jumped, but he, too, failed to reach the bag of pine
nuts. Then all the Woodpeckers took off their long beaks. Woodpecker
took all these beaks and placed one

upon another. <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](wsm07.htm#fn_2.md) The next time
he jumped, he ripped open the deerskin bag and all the pine nuts fell
down.

Coyote's people ate and ate. Finally, there was only one pin, nut left.

An old man went to the owners of the pine nuts and cried, "Wake up! Wake
up! Someone is stealing your pine nuts!" They jumped up and ran after
the others. As they caught each one of Coyote's people, they killed him.
They killed many of them, but they did not find the pine nut. Coyote's
people had relayed it along to the fastest runners. Coyote said, "Give
me the pine nut. I can run fast." They gave it to Coyote. He carried it
for a short distance and gave it to Crow.

Crow took the pine nut and bit the end off it. Then he hid it in his leg
and ran. The pursuers were gaining on him. They shot him and killed him.
When they came up to him, they kicked him, but his legs, ran on by
itself, making a track to the mountains. All of Coyote's people were
dead now.

By the time the pursuers arrived at the mountains, the pine nut trees
had already grown. They grew all over the mountainsides. This was a long
time ago. There are no pine nuts on the mountains up north where
Coyote's people stole them. Only junipers grow there now.
