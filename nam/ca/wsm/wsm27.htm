<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Saline Valley, California. Shoshoni)</P>
<P>Cottontail lived with the people on the side of Olancha Peak. The people had no wind; there was none in the whole valley. They could hear it up on the top of the mountain, but it never came down.</P>
<P>Cottontail said, "I can bring the wind down the valley." He took a flute and went way up on the mountain side, blowing it "tu h&uacute; du d&ugrave; du d&ugrave;, mi &aacute;h" and singing "tavotsikita wo b&uuml; hai yuv&uuml;" (in effect, "I am Cottontail").&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A></P>
<P>By means of his flute playing and his singing, Cottontail brought the wind down to the people in the valley.</P>
