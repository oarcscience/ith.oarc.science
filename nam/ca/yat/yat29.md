Sun lived at Hī'tsiriha, three miles up from P‘ā'wi. There was a small
hill there of red earth. The people went out to hunt, but did not stay
long. Sunset came quickly, the day was short. It was a great trouble.
Everyone was in trouble. "What shall we do about it? If the sun came up
far off to the east and not right here near us, it would be all right."

the sun." Rabbit said, "Yes, we'll do it." The, people asked, "How?"
Rabbit said, "We'll carry it on our backs. When I'm tired, Squirrel can
take it." "Where will you put it?" "We'll put it over the mountains far
off to the east." They started to carry it, carried it off to the east.
When they got tired, they changed off. They carried the sun far, far
away, to where he now comes up.
