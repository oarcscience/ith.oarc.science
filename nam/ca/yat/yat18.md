### XIX. BETTY BROWN'S DREAM. <span id="fr_136"></span>[308](#fn_132.md)

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

I dreamt. I went off towards the east across a dried-up creek; the creek
bed was all covered with moss, it was green with moss. Now I went to the
north along the trail. Now I stood on the outside (of a house).

"Enter!" said to me a man whose hair was all white. There

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

was also a woman who was blind in one eye. <span
id="fr_137"></span>[309](#fn_133.md) She offered me as a seat a chair of
ice. I looked from one thing to another. Everything was made of ice, and
it hung down in icicles. "It is near dinner-time," she said. "He will
pull the bell," she said. "Now you will be seated, and he will pull you
up." "I seated myself, Now he had pulled me up. There was a medicine-man
sitting there, talking. The medicine-man was made of rock, he had on a
net-cap of white down; he was all white-haired, even his eye-lashes were
white. I was afraid. I sat down to eat.

(She said to me,) "Go and see your mother! She is sitting inside there
yonder." So I went into the next room to the south. "So it is you, my
daughter!" she said, and hugged me. "Go and eat!" she said, and I sat
down. Everything was of ice. "So it is you who have come here, cousin!"
(said another woman that I recognized as Mary). "We are living in a good
place. The place we lived in before was bad. This place here is very
good, it is all covered with flowers and it is green. It is very good."
And then someone overtook me. "Let us go back!" I slipped down on the
left side to the north. Then I started to go back, but I did not go back
home by the way I came.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_132"></span>[195:308](yat18.htm#fr_136.md) This dream seems to
be the result of a mixture of Indian and Christian ideas. Possibly it
owes something to the Ghost-dance movement, which reached the Yanas from
the so-called "Chico Indians," i.e., Northwest Maidu of the Sacramento
Valley.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[197:309](yat18.htm#fr_137.md) She was a. Wintun
woman, named K!ulô't‘imat?ya, whom Betty had known in life. The man she
had known as Wa'imayasi.
