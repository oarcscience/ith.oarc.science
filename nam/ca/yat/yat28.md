### V. ‘I'LHAT?AINA. <span id="fr_164"></span>[341](#fn_159.md)

One day Flint Boil said to Djuwa'lk!aina <span
id="fr_165"></span>[342](#fn_160.md) "I have been dreaming, I dreamt last
night. I dreamt about a woman and her father. What is his name? I want
to know." Djuwa'lk!aina said, "In which direction did you dream?" Flint
Boy said, "I dreamt of Yallo Bally <span
id="fr_166"></span>[343](#fn_161.md) mountain." Djuwa'lk!aina said, "I know
whom you dreamt of." Flint Boy asked, "What is his name?" Said
Djuwa'lk!aina, "Tcuitcuiwayu. He lives there." Flint Boy said, "I want
to go there, and I want to take my nephew <span
id="fr_167"></span>[344](#fn_162.md) along." Djuwa'lk!aina said, "Yes."
Flint Boy said, "I am going to marry the daughter, but I have no company
on the road." Djuwa'lk!aina said, "But you are going to take your
nephew." Flint Boy said, "Yes, but I want something like a bear,
something that makes a noise. I don't want

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

him to talk as we do. He must talk another language." Djuwa'lk!aina
said, "What is he going to say?" Flint Boy said, "When he sees any one
coming he will say, 'Wū, wū!' I want to make a dog." Djuwa'lk!aina said
nothing. Flint Boy asked if she wanted to bear it talk now. She said,
"Yes." So Flint Boy said to his nephew, "Bark, practice!" His nephew did
so, said, "Wū, wū, wūūūū." It was a terrible sound, and every one heard
it all over the world-north, east, south, west. Flint Boy said, "What
shall I call you? You bite and bark." His nephew said, "My name is
‘I'lhat?aina. I must have a big throat to bark." Flint Boy asked him to
try barking again, and he did so. All the people in the world heard him,
all said, "I hear a dog. That is Flint Boy's dog." ‘I'lhat?aina, was
small, but he made a great noise.

Flint Boy went away, went to the Sacramento valley, came to Sacramento
river. He crossed with ‘I'lhat?aina, and went on to the west. He came to
the mountain at night, went up to the sweat-house, looked in, and saw
the girl of whom he had dreamt. Many other people were there also. She
sat on the east side. Flint Boy came in and sat down beside her. All
looked at him, her father and mother looked, and said, "Who is that?"
Flint Boy had left ‘I'lhat?aina, outside, had tied him to the acorn
sacks. Her father said, "Where did that man come from?" The girl said
that she did not know. "It looks as if you were married," said her
father, and he gave her a black-bear skin for Flint Boy to sit on.

Flint Boy had told ‘I'lhat?aina not to bark or bite any one. "I am going
to marry the girl. When I have done so, I shall get up early to hunt,
and I shall tell her to take care of you." Early in the morning Flint
Boy got up and told his wife about the dog, told her that it was vicious
and that she must not touch it or talk to it. In that case it would not
bite her. She agreed to care for it. Flint Boy went away. The woman went
out and saw the dog. She patted it, saying, "Nice dog." The dog shook
its head and tail, and said, "Where is my master?" She answered, "He has
gone away." Then the dog barked, and every one was frightened, terribly
frightened. Flint Boy heard it far away; he was frightened, for he knew
that some one had fooled

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

with the dog. "I believe I've lost my dog." Some one had really turned
it loose. ‘I'lhat?aina tracked Flint Boy, while the woman was
frightened. ‘I'lhat?aina could not find his master. Flint Boy came back,
brought ten deer. The woman said, "I've fed him and turned him loose."
"It's a bad dog. You ought not to have touched it."

That night it grew cloudy, while before it had been pleasant. Flint Boy
went out, finally found the dog. He tied him up again, and told him to
bark. He did so--"Wū, wū, wūūūū!" Djuwa'lk!aina heard it and said, "I
bear Flint Boy's dog in the west at Bally mountain." All the people
heard it and said, "That is Flint Boy's dog. He is married here at Bally
mountain." By and by Flint Boy went out to hunt again, and gave the same
instructions as before. The people made him bark as before, let him
loose. Flint Boy heard him. "I know what is the matter," said he,

It grew cloudy. The dog said, "It will rain." On the top of Bally
mountain there was a great cloud, black and thick. The cloud came down
over the dog, it swirled and rolled, and it went up in the air. The dog
was in the cloud, he had called it and made it about himself. He did not
want to be tied up, but to go with Flint Boy on his hunts. So he left
Flint Boy and went up above. When he got part way up he barked, and the
people heard it all over the world. Flint Boy heard it and was sad, for
he knew the dog was lost. He never saw his dog again. ‘I'lhat?aina lives
in the black clouds still. When he barks, it thunders.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_159"></span>[221:341](yat28.htm#fr_164.md) This account of the
origin of thunder is only the latter part of the myth of "The Flints and
Grizzly Bears" obtained by Dr. Dixon from Sam Bat‘wī. It corresponds
closely enough to my own version, but is published here because of its
greater wealth of details.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[221:342](yat28.htm#fr_165.md) Flint Boy's
grandmother. The name means "rock-lying-on-ground."

<span id="fn_161"></span>[221:343](yat28.htm#fr_166.md) The Yallo Bally
mountains are west of the Sacramento at Red Bluff, a very considerable
distance to the southwest of Redding. The reference is more probably to
Bally mountain (6246 ft.), one of the main peaks of the Bully Choop
range. It is within easy sight of and almost due west from Redding.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[221:344](yat28.htm#fr_167.md) ‘I'lhat?aina, who
had been dug up from the ground, is here termed the nephew of Flint Boy.
