<p>Gopher and Cottontail Rabbit gambled. Gopher had many arrows and a bow. He told Rabbit, "We will always gamble when we meet." "Let us do so today." So they cut sticks at Big Cow creek. Gopher bet one of his arrows first, and lost. Next he bet another one, and lost. Then he bet his bow, and lost. He bet his quiver, and lost. He bet his belt, and lost. Everything he had he lost. He said, "I have nothing left to bet. I will bet my people." Rabbit said, "All right." He bet his people, and lost. He bet his wives, and lost them. He bet his children, and lost. He said, "I will bet myself." He bet his arm, and lost. He bet the other arm, and lost. He bet all his body, and lost all.</p>
