This is a collection of texts from the Yana, a native Californian people
who spoke a Hokan language. The Yana lived in the north-eastern
Sacramento region of California, east of Redding and north of Chico.
Their mythology was very similar to their neighbors, the Maidu, the
Shasta and the Wintun; the trickster, Coyote, plays a very important
role. There is no cosmological origin myth recorded here. Rather the
mythology starts out in a fully realized dream-time inhabited by animal
spirits. They are busy sketching in the world that humans will inhabit.
The text, the 'Origin of Sex, Hands, and Death', starts off with an
interesting twist: women were originally men, and men were originally
women.

The most famous Yana, belonging to a subgroup called the Yahi, was Ishi,
billed as 'The last wild Indian'. Ishi stumbled out of the mountains
near Oroville in 1911, the year after this monograph was published. Ishi
was taken Berkeley where he lived the remainder of his life, studied
closely by the anthropologists Alfred Kroeber and Thomas Talbot
Waterman. Ishi died in 1916. He is the subject of an excellent book by
Theodora Kroeber, wife of Alfred Krober, [Ishi in Two
Worlds](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0520229401/internetsacredte.md).
