### II. THE THEFT OF FIRE AND THE BURNING OF THE WORLD.  <span id="fr_13"></span>[47](#fn_13.md)

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

There was no fire. It is true that people had a kind of fire, but it was
not hot. The people went to hunt and kill deer, they went to get salmon,
and the women went to get sunflower seeds. The people roasted deer meat,
but it was never done. People fetched home salmon and cooked it over the
fire, but it was never done. They ate salmon and deer meat raw. The
women just slightly browned the sunflower seeds; they were never done.
"Hehe'<sup>?</sup>!" said the men, "I do not like this fire. I am tired
now of eating deer meat raw. Hehe'<sup>?</sup>! there must be fire
somewhere around here. There may be fire off to the east, east over the
mountains; there may be fire in the south; there may be fire off to the
west; there may be fire in the north." The people came together to talk
together in council. "Let us look for fire," they said. "Every night,
when the sun has already set and it is dark, go up to the north and stay
on top of the mountain," one man was told. "Yes," he said.

Every night when it was dark this one man sat there. He stayed and
looked to the east. There was no fire in the east, no fire was to be
seen. He looked to the north; there was no fire in

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

the north. He looked to the west, there was no fire, he did not see any
fire. He looked to the south. There there was indeed some fire. There
was a light in the south, the fire was seen coming up in sparks. Down in
the south they had good fire. This one man now returned home. Many were
the people gathered together. "I have seen fire," he said. "Indeed!
Where is it? Where is the fire?" "In the south. It is faraway from
here." "Let us go and steal it," they said. "Yes, who is the good
runner?" (said the chief). "I" (said Fox). "It is I who know how to
run." "Who else is a good runner?" "I" (said another). There were two
who knew how to run well. "What is your name?" (asked the chief of the
first). "Fox." "What is your name?" he asked of the second).
"‘A'iwi<sup>?</sup>auna." <span id="fr_14"></span>[48](#fn_14.md) "Yes, it
is good now."

Behold! The men went off, five of them. They walked in a circle around
the village. "Where shall we go?" (they asked one another). "Let us go
to the south under the ground." The five men proceeded south under the
ground, went off south in the night-time. Arriving in the south, they
came up from the ground at K!ū'wiha. <span
id="fr_15"></span>[49](#fn_15) Coyote was sleeping; (on their arrival.md)
he arose and said, "Well, where are the people all going to?" "I do not
know," said the people there, talking to Coyote. Coyote talked to the
rocks, talked to the cooking-basket, talked to the house. "You, tell me,
Rock! where are they all going to?" "I do not know," said the rock, said
the house. "Where are they all going to?" (he asked the) brush for
cleaning acorn flour. "They have all gone out to hunt deer." "Hê!"
(exclaimed Coyote), "Why didn't they tell me that?" Now Coyote went to
the east, but the five men had already gone a great distance to the
south. Coyote ran around the village in a circle, but did not find any
tracks. Coyote asked the acorn mortar, "Mortar Woman! Where have the
five men all gone to?" "They have all gone to the south." "Indeed!"
"Yes." Now Coyote ran,

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

running off to the south after them. Coyote found their tracks as he ran
after them. The five men had already traveled a great distance, but
Coyote caught up with the five men. "Hä!" Coyote shouted in a whisper,
"do you wait for me!" The five men looked back (and said in displeasure
to one another), "Oh! Coyote has been coming after us." The five men
went off to the south day and night, while Coyote came after them.
"Huh!" Coyote panted, "I am tired. "Heh!" said Coyote, "Why didn't you
tell me about it!" The five men did not talk, for they were angry.

They reached the fire village, arrived in the middle of the night. The
light from the fire came up out of the sweat-house. They stole the fire
while the people that owned it were all lying asleep on the ground. They
went up on a hill to the south of the sweat-house. There lay a chunk of
burning coal inside of the sweat-house. It was two of the men, Fox and
‘A'iwi<sup>?</sup>auna, who stole the fire. "How are we going to manage
it? You go inside," he said to Fox. He looked inside in the night, and
climbed down through the smoke-hole. The people that had the fire were
all asleep. Fox put his hand out for the fire, picked it up, and jumped
quickly out of the sweat-house. He carried the fire out with him, having
stolen it. They ran to the north. "Run! run, all of you!" (said
‘A'iwi<sup>?</sup>auna). "When you are tired out, throw the fire to me."
They kept running to the north, while Coyote kept running back after
them. When they had run back as far as Balê'ha, <span
id="fr_16"></span>[50](#fn_16.md) Coyote said, asking Fox, "Well! Give me
the fire. I shall carry the fire in my hand," said Coyote. "Look out!"
said Fox, "you might drop it down on the ground, you might burn your
hand." "What did I go off to the south for? I shall tell the people when
I return home, I shall say that I carried fire. 'I have carried fire!' I
shall tell them." They ran back home from the south, they ran back as
far as K!ū'wiha. "Give me the fire," said Coyote. Coyote was given the
fire (as Fox called out to him), "Hold out your hand." Coyote held out
his hand as he was told. Fox was still carrying his fire in

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

his hand. "Here it is, take it to yourself," (he said. and) gave it to
him. Coyote took the fire, while Fox and ‘A'iwi<sup>?</sup>auna rushed
off. They have thrown their fire to Coyote, as they come running back
home from the south.

Coyote burned his hand and dropped his fire. The chunk of coal burst
apart into several pieces. "M‘! du' du du du' du du! <span
id="fr_17"></span>[50a](#fn_17.md) said Coyote, for he had burned his hand.
Everything burned all around, when the fire had been dropped. The fire
burned in the south, the fire burned in the east, the fire burned off to
the west, the fire burned in the north. It came burning up to this place
here. The rocks burst from the heat, the water burned up. The mountain
was all covered with smoke, it burned right across the Sacramento river,
the people burned up. The two people (that had stolen the fire) rushed
off, while the fire came burning after them. It burned and reached up to
Eagles village at Cī'p!a. <span id="fr_18"></span>[51](#fn_18.md)

"Hurry up, everybody! This place is burning, the people are burning.
Whither shall we go? We can't move into the rocks, we can't move down
into the round. Hurry up, all of you!" Spider was living with them.
Hurry up, everybody! (Eagle said). "Have you strong rope?" (said Eagle
to Spider). "Yes," said Spider. "Do you all go into my big tule basket.
Stretch out!" (he said to the basket). They all went inside now, and
Spider tied the tule basket on to the sky. Coyote lay down on his belly
in the bottom of the tule basket. "Go ahead!" said Eagle. "Hurry up,
everybody! This place is burning already." Now Spider pulled the rope up
to the sky, pulled the people up. The people filled the tule basket;
everybody had gone in to save themselves in the tule basket, together
with their children. "Go ahead!" Spider was told. Now there was nobody
left in the sweat-house. He pulled up the basket, pulled it up, way up
to

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

the sky. The fire was crackling all over this place. He had almost
pulled the people who were running away from danger clear up to the sky
when Coyote said, "Well! I am going to look down, my friends. I am going
to see the fire, my friends." "Look out!" (said Eagle). "I shall just
tear out a little hole in the basket. I want to see how the fire is
burning down there. I shall look down to the ground through a tiny
little hole," (said) Coyote, desiring to see the fire. He made a little
rent in the tule basket, while Spider kept pulling at his rope. Coyote
looked down, the fire was seen. He enlarged the rent in the tule basket.
He looked down through the hole and said, "Hê! I see the fire. There is
much fire." "Look out! you might fall down through the hole," (said
Eagle). The hole spread out a little more so that the basket was now
torn a good bit. Coyote fell down through the hole, fell right back down
to the ground.

Fire-Drill Woman <span id="fr_19"></span>[52](#fn_19.md) was standing below
and looked around. She looked up, saw the people falling down back to
the ground. The people all burned up, burned up completely. Black Bear's
eyes popped out way to the east, they popped way to the west, the eyes
popped way to the north, his eyes popped to the south. He burned up, but
his eyes popped off. <span id="fr_20"></span>[53](#fn_20.md) Spider
remained in the sky.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_13"></span>[23:47](yat04.htm#fr_13.md) The scene of this myth
is laid at Bā'djiyu, an Indian village said to have been located above
P‘ā'wi, a village on Clover creek at a distance of about eight miles
from Millville. Curtin's myth of "The Finding of Fire" (*op. cit.*, pp.
365-370 or no. XIII of this paper) is located at Pawi. The two versions
agree fairly well in localization and content, the main differences
being that the characteristic episode of the pursuit of the fire-thieves
is lacking in Sam Bat‘wī's account (the omission is not accidental, for,
when asked, Sam claimed there was no pursuit) and that Curtin's version
makes no mention of the burning of the world and the consequent ascent
to the sky. The latter episode, however, may have been borrowed from the
Loon story (see note 52). Of the three fire-thieves in Curtin's story
two, Ahalamila (fox, not gray wolf) and Metsi (coyote), are identical
with *‘ahā'limilla* and *me'tc!i* of Sam's version; the third, Shushu
Marimi (dog woman), is replaced by *‘a'iwi<sup>?</sup>auna*, perhaps the
sandpiper. It is worthy of note that there are in Sam's as in Curtin's
account really only three fire-stealing of the five men that start out
only two are named, Coyote joining the party later on. For similar fire
myths see Kroeber's "Ute Tales" (Journ. Am. Folk-Lore, XIV, 252);
Kroeber's "Myths of South Central California" (Univ. Calif. Publ. Am.
Arch. Ethn., IV, 211. Truhohi Yokuts with fox, road-runner, coyote, and
crow as fire-thieves); Dixon's "Achomawi and Atsugewi Tales" (Journ. Am.
Folk-Lore, XXI, 165, 175); and Dixon's "Maidu Myths" (Bull. Amer. Mus.
Nat. Hist., XVII, 65). Another Yana fire myth, constructed on Maidu
lines, is referred to in Dixon's "Northern Maidu" (*op. cit.*), p. 339.
The version contained in Dixon's manuscript Yana note-books, however,
does not differ materially from that here given.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[32:48](yat04.htm#fr_14.md) A bird described as
brown in color, somewhat bigger than a snow bird, and running along the
river shore. Perhaps the sandpiper. *‘aiwi<sup>?</sup>au-* may be,
either actually or by popular etymology, connected with
*‘ai<sup>?</sup>au*- "to carry fire."

<span id="fn_15"></span>[32:49](yat04.htm#fr_15.md) An Indian village at
North Fork of Battle Creek.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[33:50](yat04.htm#fr_16.md) An Indian village at
Mill creek, situated on a mountain several miles east of Tehama. It was
considered by Sam Bat‘wī to be the farthest Yana point to the south.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[34:50a](yat04.htm#fr_17.md) It is very curious
that practically the same exclamation (do' do do do do do) is used in a
Takelma (southwestern Oregon) text by ghosts on catching fire. The
resemblance becomes an identity if we remember that close *o* and open
*u* are respectively lacking to Yana and Takelma.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[34:51](yat04.htm#fr_18.md) An Indian village on
the flat hill (the so-called "Bullskin") that forms the divide between
Oak Run and Little Cow creek, removed about half a mile from the former
stream. A small lake was situated near by, the resort in former days of
countless geese as they migrated north in the spring. See p. 40, l. 1,
and p. 142, l. 8.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[35:52](yat04.htm#fr_19.md) Sam Bat‘wī claimed that
Fire-Drill Woman was another name for *‘ak!ā'lisi*, "Loon." This would
make it plausible that the sky episode of this myth is really taken over
from the identical incident in the Loon Woman story; see note 207 and
Curtin's "Two Sisters, Haka Lasi and Tsore Jowall (*op. cit.*), pp.
409-10; also no. X of this paper.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[35:53](yat04.htm#fr_20.md) This explains why black
bears are to be found in every direction. No attempt was made to explain
how two eyes could pop off in four directions.
