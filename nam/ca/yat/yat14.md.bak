### XIV. INDIAN MEDICINE-MEN.  <span id="fr_110"></span>[273](#fn_107.md)

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

(The) medicine woman (said), "It is four days now that I have been
doctoring her, and she is not well yet. I am afraid that perhaps she
will not recover." "Do you go after him," (said the sick woman's
husband,) "perhaps he will cure her. He is always saying, 'I am a great
medicine-man.'"

(The medicine-man) has arrived. "Put down water on the ground!" <span
id="fr_111"></span>[274](#fn_108.md) Round white shell beads he offered him
as pay, he offered him dentalia. (He thought,) "He will be glad because
of these, when he sees them." "I do not like these trinkets

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

here," (said the medicine-man). "I like p!ale'‘si shell beads." "And do
you doctor her! Doctor her during the night, perhaps she will recover."
"Oh, I am not afraid of my doctoring the one that is sick. Why should I
be afraid? I am a medicine-man. She will not cry. She will yet eat her
own food." "Go out of the house! Shout! Call upon your dream spirit So
always does the medicine-man do." "She will recover, I dreamt. 'Pray
speak to the spring of water!' my dream tells me. 'Pray do not eat! Go
ahead and eat tomorrow when the sun is overhead! You shall go to the
spring to bathe!' I dreamt. 'Pray pass the night on the mountain!' Now I
shall return in the night. Wake up the people. They will help to sing. I
am a good medicine-man. 'Pray ask the rocks! Ask the trees! Ask the
logs! Go about twice, and the owl will talk and the yellowhammer, and
pray roll tobacco between your hands and smoke it. Do not eat anything!
Pick up the round luck stones!' Thus I dreamt. She will recover."

"Ho! you people wake up! He's <span id="fr_112"></span>[275](#fn_109.md)
already coming back. Do you all go into the house together and sing. I
shall do likewise whenever any of you are sick; I shall do likewise,
even if I do not sleep. There are still other people who have not come
to my house. If I had had much to eat they would all have come, and they
would all have been laughing among themselves, if I should have had food
to give them. <span id="fr_113"></span>[276](#fn_110.md) Those people do
not like to assist in singing. I shall go to bring them; they shall help
to sing. I suppose they raise their hands contemptuously at me. <span
id="fr_114"></span>[277](#fn_111.md) Perhaps, is it not, they are sound
asleep or eating, therefore they do not come over. I suppose they do not
hear. Run over to tell them to come tomorrow! 'I am a sensible person,'
indeed they say. Pray do not let them say that, even if they have
handsome wives. <span id="fr_115"></span>[278](#fn_112.md) If they refuse,
pray let at least one come along. Pray

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

let him come the day after tomorrow." "I should like to see my brother.
Do you go after him to bring him back to me!" (said the sick woman).

(The medicine-man said,) "I have dreamt of everything. 'Pray do so!' it
said to me. 'Doctor her for three nights!' said my dream to me. 'She
shall recover and go about, she shall go off to get roots, she shall
procure food for herself,' said my dream to me. 'Shout! Run around the
house, when you are about to enter the house again.' Pray do not make a
noise. Pray stop the children from making a sound, stop the dogs from
making a noise! I might stagger and fall down, I have not much heart."
(When he returned, he said,) "There is no one here, I am the first. I am
tired already. The medicine-woman is angry, is she not? therefore she
does not help me in doctoring. Let her soak cu'nna roots in water. I
shall eat them raw. Now I shall eat them, if I see that she <span
id="fr_116"></span>[279](#fn_113.md) is to eat her own. I shall not go off
and leave her, I shall go off home only when she shall have recovered. I
rejoice (that she will recover). I do not like to have my brother lose
her. I always come here and I always eat here, that is why I am sorry
for him. I am the only medicine-man. I go to every spring, and I am
answered. It <span id="fr_117"></span>[280](#fn_114.md) will not abandon
me. Blood flows from out of my nose, I have it running out of my body;
the blood flows straight out, every part of my body is covered with
blood. I shall find it <span id="fr_118"></span>[281](#fn_115.md) for you.
If I die, then all the good people will die, then they will drop dead. I
was possessed of supernatural power. The women are not thus. The women
that are doctors I have never yet heard to cure; they merely put on
style, wearing their ceremonial net-caps. I am not thus, that is why I
remain alive. <span id="fr_119"></span>[282](#fn_116.md) I am let alone,
and I am good. People take pity on me, that is why it is that I am quick
to take pity on them. I am seen coming and she is told, 'Hurry up and
cook! he is already coining! Feed him!' he says to his wife. 'Cook!'

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

he says. 'Feed him!' I dreamt, that is why I came here; I came to see
what I could do for you. I would not do thus, I shall not step in that
trail, if I drop dead. Now I shall have ceased. <span
id="fr_120"></span>[283](#fn_117.md) I seem to be like one who looks on,
while you people are eating. I have never done thus, although my people
are many in number. <span id="fr_121"></span>[284](#fn_118.md) I seem to be
like one who looks on, and as though I say, 'Would that I might enter
the house!', that therefore I came."

### XV. MARRIAGE.

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

He had been bringing her food. (She said to him,) "I do not love you."
(Her mother said to her,) "I like him. Take him for your husband! I want
to have him as son-in-law. I will not have you in my house, you shall
not again enter my house (unless you take him as husband). Let us get
food!" <span id="fr_122"></span>[286](#fn_119) (Then she said to him,.md)
"We shall go together. I love you very much. To-morrow we shall get
married. Let all of your people come here. All of you come and see us,
and stay all night! I have nothing to say against it. I do not know what
(my mother) says, but probably she will be very glad to have (you) as
son-in-law.

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

(Her mother said to her,) "I am glad that you have taken him as husband;
I am tired of feeding you. You shall go home with him and keep house
with him, and you will have children. Truly I shall come to see you, and
he will come to see us. Whenever I am hungry you will give us food. He
will go to hunt deer, and I shall fetch it home. He will go to get
salmon, and I shall fetch it home. Do you give us food! You shall give
us food, and I shall pound acorns. I shall do similarly for you. I shall
fetch them to your house, and you will feel rejoiced, my daughter!
Whenever you see me coming you will feel rejoiced, and you will give
food to your people. Every one of them will be glad. You have always
been very good, you have been sensible. Your husband is a good man and
he is sensible."

(He said to her,) "And I will give you as food whatever I hunt. Surely I
shall not whip you. You on your part shall not scold me." (She said to
him,) "If I have a child we shall go off to your house. Stay now in my
house." (He said to her,) "Yes, I will stay in your house. Now I shall
go out hunting." (She said to him,) "Now we shall grow old together.
Perhaps it will be I who shall die first, perhaps it will be you."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_107"></span>[174:273](yat14.htm#fr_110.md) In this and the
following texts attempt was made to secure from Betty Brown an account
in her own language of some phases of Yana religious and social life.
Owing to her tendency to use conversational narrative instead of general
description, these texts are rather illustrative by means of real or
imaginary incidents of the life of the Yana than ethnologically
satisfying statements. No. XIV gives an idea of the touchy medicine-man,
insulted because few are found willing to assist him in his doctoring.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[178:274](yat14.htm#fr_111.md) For the
medicine-man. Cf. p. 193, l. 2.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[179:275](yat14.htm#fr_112.md) I.e., the
medicine-man, who has passed the night up on the mountain to gain
supernatural power.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[179:276](yat14.htm#fr_113.md) They would laugh
for joy. As it is, they are not very enthusiastic about helping a poor
man.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[179:277](yat14.htm#fr_114.md) It was a sign of
contempt to extend one's arm with outspread fingers towards another.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[179:278](yat14.htm#fr_115.md) Bitterly ironical.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[180:279](yat14.htm#fr_116.md) I.e., the sick
woman.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[180:280](yat14.htm#fr_117.md) I.e., my
supernatural power, guardian spirit.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[180:281](yat14.htm#fr_118.md) I.e., the
disease-causing "pain."

<span id="fn_116"></span>[180:282](yat14.htm#fr_119.md) He implies that he
does not cause any one's death, so that there has been no reason to seek
his life. If a medicine-man failed too frequently to cure, he was
suspected of malice and was decapitated.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[181:283](yat14.htm#fr_120.md) The medicine-man is
disgusted with the scurvy treatment accorded him and swears never to do
as much again.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[181:284](yat14.htm#fr_121.md) I.e., although
there are many relatives whose hospitality I might claim.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[182:286](yat14.htm#fr_122.md) In other words, the
mother finds it hard to support her daughter and is only too glad to
dispose of her to a desirable son-in-law.
