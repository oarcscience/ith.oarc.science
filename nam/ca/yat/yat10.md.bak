# II. NORTHERN DIALECT (Garī'?i.)  <span id="fr_74"></span>[202](#fn_72.md)

### X. COYOTE, PINE MARTEN, AND LOON.  <span id="fr_75"></span>[207](#fn_73.md)

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

Coyote went around looking for gophers' roots by tapping with a stick at
Yū'mimadu, <span id="fr_76"></span>[208](#fn_74.md) he felt about for
gophers' holes by tapping. Suddenly he heard someone coming to him
singing. "Heh!" he said. "Ih!" he said. He looked all around, when
suddenly he saw two girls. "Ih!" he said. He threw away his open-work
carrying basket, he threw away his digging-stick. He threw away the
pitch. He took off and threw off his signs of mourning. Now he put on
his buckskin trousers. He put dentalia on his shirt, he put dentalia on
his moccasins.

(He said to them,) "Do you go there, to my house! Yes, they said.
Bull-Frog Woman, Coyote's wife, was pounding acorns. "Hê!" she said,
"what are you going in there for? Who told you to go there? Pine Marten
is dwelling yonder, up

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

towards the south. Two black-bear skins are hanging up; just look at
them! This is Coyote living here. Don't look at him! This is Coyote here
living between the two houses. He has stolen the black-bear skins from
the next house on the west. <span id="fr_77"></span>[209](#fn_75.md) Don't
go into Coyote's house! This here is Coyote. The people have gone into
yonder house. They have come back home from hunting and have been
staying over there.

(The elder sister said,) "I do not know about this. We see the
black-bear skins. We should enter the house. Our father told us, 'You
will go as far as that.'" (They argued as to whether they should go in
or not, but finally they entered. When Coyote returned he said to them,)
"I suppose they are going to bring back meat. It is dark already. I
always distribute deer meat. I hire those fellows yonder. Everyone has
been carrying home deer meat, everyone has been killing deer, and they
have already come back home. I feel ashamed because I have no meat left
over. I always give food to everybody, and it is my custom to distribute
it. Now I shall go east to the next house." (He said to his wife,) "Make
a big fire. We shall roast the meat."

Coyote looked on while Pine Marten's people were eating, but did not
enter the house. Bones were thrown out of the house to him, one after
the other, and he swallowed them. They were thrown out to him, and he
kept swallowing the deer bones. He finished, went back west to his
house, stood on the roof of his sweat-house. He cut out pieces of flesh
from his hams. He went into the house (saying to his wife,) "I have no
meat left over. Cook this! Feed them with it!" (To the girls he said,)
"I always do so; I never have any left over. <span
id="fr_78"></span>[210](#fn_76.md) Tomorrow I shall have some left over,
and you shall have plenty to eat." "Ih!" she said. "It seems to be
human. It does not taste like deer meat; it tastes like human flesh. We
were not told to enter here. It seems to be Coyote who lives here. Pine
Marten lives in the next house on the east. I smell nothing but deer fat
over there. We

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

were told that Coyote lives between the two houses. You have no sense,"
(she said to her elder sister).

She went east to the next house when it was daylight. She entered the
house. (Pine Marten's mother said to her,) "You two thought that that
was somebody living over there. That is Coyote. He has stolen the
black-bear skins. That is Coyote living there, those hides belong to
us." (After she had been given much to eat she returned to her sister,
and said to her,) "I have been given food; I have eaten much. He yonder
is really the one (we are looking for). I told you so before, but you
wouldn't listen. Eat this here! Much have I eaten." "Well," (her sister
said,) "I shall go and bathe. We shall go east to the next house." (Pine
Marten's mother) spread out a black-bear skin on the ground for them.
"Do you two enter! I don't know what Pine Marten will do. Perhaps he
won't turn to look at you." She roasted food and gave it to them to eat.
"Do you eat this! Probably you were told to come here." (When they came
back from hunting) someone said, "Hm! She smells like Coyote's divorced
wife." "Sh!" (said Pine Marten's mother,) "don't say that! My son might
feel ashamed. Just behave yourself! Don't talk in that way," she said.

(Coyote was very angry, and said to himself,) "You think you will go out
to hunt deer! Now I shall cause it to rain." It rained and it was like
winter. The water rose high. (All the people were inside Pine Marten's
sweat-house, and Coyote put it on fire.) "It is I that did it," (said
Coyote). They all survived together. The sweat-house burned all up.
(They said,) "Let us escape. Let us all go up into the sky." Coyote
said, "I shall go along with you. Oh, I shall lie on my belly in the
bottom of the basket." "You will not do right," (they said to him). "I
shall just lie down on my belly in the bottom of the basket," he said.
"Do you all get inside now!" (said the chief. To Spider Woman he called
out,) "Pull us up to you!" She pulled them up. (When they were
approaching the sky, (someone noticed that Coyote was making a hole, and
said,) "Oh! it's going to break apart!" "Heh!" (said Coyote to Pine
Marten's people). "Now you know, do you not, that I am jealous of you."
The basket broke apart and fell down to the ground.

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

 <span id="fr_79"></span>[211](#fn_77.md) (All were burnt to death except
one). An old gray-haired woman, Bo'‘nuyaup!a, <span
id="fr_80"></span>[212](#fn_78.md) alone survived. She cried, "Whither now
shall I go? I shall go far away to the north. Two who still survive
there will indeed take pity on me. I shall hire them." (She went up
north.) There were geese there in great numbers. Many of them were
killed (by those two). "We kill many of them," (they said to her). "Have
you not perchance seen her who has destroyed us all? You may have done
so." "Yes," they said. "We have seen some one. Perhaps indeed it is that
one whom you mean." "Perhaps she wears a bead necklace," she said. "Yes,
she wears a white necklace of beads." "Would that you took pity on me!"
(she said. "Kill her for me!") "I shall indeed do so this very same
night." (That night he killed the Loon Woman and took off the necklace
of beads. Every bead was really the heart <span
id="fr_81"></span>[212a](#fn_79.md) of one of the people that had been
burnt to death. He gave the necklace to Bo'‘nuyaup!a).

"Now I shall be happy. Now I shall go off home." She came back home to
her house. She struck the hearts, and the people came back to life. They
all came back to life. "You thought concerning me, did you not, 'She has
no sense.' You would have treated me in that way! But my friends are
dwelling yonder, far away in the north. I suppose you said to yourself,
'I have killed them all,' did you not? But you did not kill them. You
thought you were sensible. It was you who thought of killing me." <span
id="fr_82"></span>[213](#fn_80.md) Now it is ended.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_72"></span>[129:202](yat10.htm#fr_74.md) The thirteen garī'?i
myths and non-mythical texts here given were obtained in July and
August, 1907, a few miles to the north of the hamlet of Round Mountain
(or Buzzard's Roost), Shasta county. The informant was Betty Brown
(Indian name Ts!ī'daimiya), since dead. There are now not more than
seven or eight Indians that are able to speak the dialect. In some
respects Betty was an inferior source of text material to Sam Bat‘wī, as
evidenced by the very small number of myths it was found possible to
procure from her. Her method of narrative was peculiar in that she had a
very marked tendency to omit anything, even the names of the characters
involved, that was not conversation; this has necessitated the liberal
use in the English translation of parentheses in which the attempt is
made to arrive at a somewhat smoother narrative.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[129:207](yat10.htm#fr_75.md) Two quite distinct
myths seem in this to have been amalgamated by Betty Brown into one. The
first is the well-known story of the visit of two sisters to a chief
(generally Panther, in this case Pine Marten) and their deception by
Coyote, who poses as the chief. For this first myth cf. Dixon's Achomawi
tale in "Achomawi and Atsugewi Tales," Journ. Am. Folk-Lore, XXI, 163.
The second is the Loon Woman story typical of Northern California, of
which but a fragmentary, ill remembered account is here found. For the
latter myth cf. Curtin's "Two Sisters, Haka Lasi \[= ts\*!orê'djuwa,
"loon"\] and Tsore Jowa \[= ts\*!orê'djuwa, "eagle"\]," (op. cit., pp.
407-21); Dixon, "Maidu Myths," pp. 71-6; and the Achomawi and Atsugewi
versions in Dixon's "Achomawi and Atsugewi Tales," pp. 165, 175.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[133:208](yat10.htm#fr_76.md) A point near the
present station situated about a mile and a half south of Montgomery
Creek.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[134:209](yat10.htm#fr_77.md) The two sisters had
been told by their father that they would recognize Pine Marten by the
black-bear skins hanging up in front of his house.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[134:210](yat10.htm#fr_78.md) Coyote pretends that
he is so liberal in the distribution of deer meat, that he never has any
left over for himself.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[136:211](yat10.htm#fr_79.md) From here on the
trend of the first story is absolutely lost, the remainder being a much
abbreviated account of the latter part of the Loon story.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[136:212](yat10.htm#fr_80.md) An unidentified bird.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[136:212a](yat10.htm#fr_81.md) So Curtin and Dixon.
In another connection Betty Brown said the white encircling the loon's
neck was due to the fact that she had at one time put the intestines of
people about her neck.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[136:213](yat10.htm#fr_82.md) These words are an
apostrophe to the dead Loon Woman.
