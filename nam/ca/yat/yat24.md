# III. SUPPLEMENTARY YANA MYTHS  <span id="fr_148"></span>[329](#fn_144)

##### (COLLECTED By DR. R. B. DIXON)

### I. THE CREATION OF MEN. <span id="fr_149"></span>[330](#fn_145)

Lizard, Gray Squirrel, and Coyote lived in a big sweat-house at
Wamā'rawi. <span id="fr_150"></span>[331](#fn_146) They had no wives or
children. Coyote wanted to make people, but the others thought that they
themselves were enough. Finally Lizard agreed, "We'll make people,
different kinds of people." So Lizard went out and cut three sticks like
gambling sticks. The others wanted to know how he was going to make
people out of these. Lizard said, "I'll show you." One stick he took for
the Hat Creeks (Tc‘unô'yāna), one for the Wintun (Yā'?wi), and one for
the Pit Rivers (Wa‘djā'mi). <span id="fr_151"></span>[332](#fn_147) When
he looked at them he said, "There is something lacking." Coyote asked,
"Who has been left out?" Lizard said, "The Yana." So he took any kind of
a stick, broke it up into little pieces, and put them in a pile for the
Yana. The

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

stick for the Hat Creeks he placed in the east, the stick for the Wintun
in the west, the stick for the Pit Rivers in the north.

All three, Lizard, Gray Squirrel, and Coyote, then made a big basket,
heated rocks, put water in the basket, and heated the water by putting
the hot rocks into the basket. Then Lizard put the sticks into the
boiling water, put in more hot rocks to boil the sticks. All then went
to sleep, after setting the basket outside on the roof and covering it
up. Before they slept Lizard said, "Early in the morning you will hear
some one when the basket turns over. That will be because there are
people. You must keep still, must not move or snore."

Early in the morning they heard people falling down, heard the basket
turn over. By and by they heard the people walking about outside. They
got up, then covered the door with a large rock to keep the people out.
They did not talk or answer those outside. For a long time the people
were talking. One called out, "Where is the door?" Coyote said, "Keep
still, that talk does not sound right." <span
id="fr_152"></span>[333](#fn_148) Others then spoke, asked also. Then
Coyote said, "Now it sounds right," and then they opened the door. Then
all the people came crowding in, all came into the sweat-house. Then the
three said, "It is well. There are people."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_144"></span>[209:329](yat24.htm#fr_148) Besides the two
texts given above (nos. XXIII and XXIV) Dr. Dixon's manuscript Yana
material comprises a number of myths obtained in English. These are here
made accessible with Dr. Dixon's consent; only such changes have been
made in the wording and spelling of Indian names as seemed necessary.
Some of the myths, though here and there exhibiting interesting
variants, too closely parallel the versions obtained by Curtin and
myself to warrant publication and have therefore been omitted; they are
"The Creation of Men" (determination of sex and making of hands), "Flint
Chief's Entertainment," "The Bringing of Fire," "The First Death,"
"‘I'lhat?aina" (first part), "Coyote and Frost," and "Coyote and his
Sister." Dr. Dixon's informants were Sam Bat‘wī and Round Mountain Jack.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[209:330](yat24.htm#fr_149) What is here given
is only the first episode of Dr. Dixon's myth of "The Creation of Men,"
the other two dealing with the origin of sex and the making of hands by
Lizard. Dr. Dixon's version of the making of the Yana and other tribes
from sticks seemed different enough from my own (No. V) to justify its
inclusion here. If, as seems likely, Sam Bat‘wī was the source of this
version, it is certainly curious that it differs so markedly in detail,
if not in general character, from that secured by myself only seven
years later. It is noteworthy that Dr. Dixon's "Creation of Men" does
not include the origin of death; this was obtained by him as a separate
myth.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[209:331](yat24.htm#fr_150) See note 111.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[209:332](yat24.htm#fr_151) literally,
"dwelling-north."

<span id="fn_148"></span>[210:333](yat24.htm#fr_152) That is, they had
not yet learned to talk Yana correctly.
