### XXIV. GRIZZLY BEAR AND DEER. <span id="fr_145"></span>[319](#fn_141.md)

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

There was a house in which dwelt Deer. Grizzly Bear was angry. "Cut off
some of your flesh for me," (she said to Deer). "I am going to eat it."
Then (Deer) cut some of it right off and roasted it. (Grizzly Bear) ate
it. "It tastes good," (she said. Some time after this, she was lousing
Deer, and scratched her. Deer protested; but Grizzly Bear said,) "I was
lousing you." Now she caught hold of a louse; now she bit (Deer's) neck
and killed her. Then she cut up her belly and ate her up, ate up much.
All (the Deer people) she killed. She went off looking for (Deer's two
children, but) did not find them. She came back home. To the south she
went and killed all. She returned north. Off west she ate up all the
deer, and returned east. Off north she ate up all the elks, ate them all
up, killed all. She went eastwards again and killed all the deer. She
stood still and looked around. "I have killed them all," she said.
"Enough now!" she said, and then proceeded back home. "Let us play!"
(said Deer's children to Grizzly Bear's). "Yes, yes!" they said. "Let us
smoke each other outside!" They dug a hole in the ground. "Let us smoke
each other!" (said Deer's children). "You go in first!" (Grizzly Bear's
children said to them). "Yes, yes!" The fawns now went in. (Grizzly
Bear's children) put in pine-needles, and then caused (Deer's children)
to smoke. <span id="fr_146"></span>[321](#fn_142.md) "Enough now!" they
said, "I am all smoke now." "Yes," said (Grizzly Bear's children). Now
they came out again. "Do you go in," they said, "Grizzly Bear children!"
Then they put in pitchwood and pine-needles again, and caused (Grizzly
Bear's children) to smoke. "Enough now!" they said. (Deer's children)
held them down to the ground, (so that) they died. They were no more.
(Deer's children) took the pitchwood out again and thrust their hands
inside. They pulled out (one of Grizzly Bear's children, then) they
pulled out the other one. Each one carried one in his arms. They brought
them back into their house, laid them down on the ground, and put a
deerhide blanket over them. "Now!" they said, "let us run away! Let us
run to the south!" they said. Now they came running from the east, from
Montgomery creek.

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Where is the
rock?" (said the younger brother). "Let us proceed to the mountain,
where there is brush!" (said the older one). "No!" said the younger one,
"she might see us at the mountain," he said, "if we stay there. Let us
proceed to the rock," he said, "to where there is a rock." "Yes," said
(his brother), and then they got up on it. "It is good," they said.

Grizzly-Bear Woman now hastened back and arrived home. She went inside
again and said, "Wake up, you two! What are you doing? What are you
sleeping for?" They did not speak. Then she picked up a stick and struck
them. She put (their blanket) aside from them; they were dead. She
looked at them. "Where are they?" she said, asked the poker. It said
nothing. She asked the stone. It said nothing. She asked the earth. It
said nothing. She asked the stick, she asked the fire, she asked the
coals. "Yes," they said, "they have run to the south." "Yes," she said.
She bit the stone, for she was angry; she bit the stick; she bit the
fire. She went out. "Amm!" she said (threateningly). "Where will you go
to?" she said. Now she came running from the east, tracked them by their
footprints. For two days she ran along, came running from the east. She
did not find them. She tracked them around back to the rock. She looked
up, there indeed they were.

"Do you come down again!" she said, "O orphans! What are you running
away for? Come to me! Are you not hungry? Let us go off home! It is
nearly nightfall." "No!" (they said). "You have been killing all (of our
people),--my mother, my father, my brothers, my sisters." "Amm!" said
Grizzly-Bear Woman, and proceeded to gnaw the rock; she moved clear
around it. "O rock!" said the fawns, singing, "go upwards! rise up!" And
then it did so. It rose up while Grizzly-Bear Woman kept gnawing at it.
Only a little was left of the rock. <span
id="fr_147"></span>[328](#fn_143.md) For two days she gnawed the rock, when
suddenly she died, let her hands drop down on the ground.

They hastened down. And then they cut up her belly, pulled out (her)
entrails and hung them up. They cut off one (of her legs) and hung it
up. They cut off (her) other leg also and hung it up. They cut out her
head and threw it to the west; (her) backbone they threw to the east.
"Now!" they said, "be a grizzly bear! Eat people!" they said.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_141"></span>[203:319](yat23.htm#fr_145.md) Compare Dixon's
"Maidu Myths," p. 79, where further parallels are given (see also
Dixon's "Northern Maidu," p. 341). The Takelma of Oregon have a similar
myth.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[207:321](yat23.htm#fr_146.md) wu'lwisindja, "I am
fanning smoke into house" (from Dr Dixon's notes). The method of smoking
here employed seems to have been to fan the smoke of burning pine
needles into the temporarily constructed sweat-house; cf. Dixon's "Maidu
Myths," p. 79.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[208:328](yat23.htm#fr_147.md) Information was
secured from Betty Brown of two rocks with a circular notch said to have
been bitten in by a grizzly bear in pursuit of the deer that stood on
top. They are a short distance east of the hamlet of Montgomery Creek
and are known as djanū'nak!aina, "notched rocks." They were doubtless
thought of by Round Mountain Jack as the scene of the mythical incident.
