### XXII. PRAYER ON SNEEZING.

(Said by a Woman)

S\*ê'galt!imāyā! May I be happy! Do you people not speak about me! Do
you speak for my happiness when speaking about me!

(Said by a Man)

May I be happy! May my legs feel light! May you people speak for my
happiness! Would that you would let me alone! I bathe, and I go back
into my house, and I rejoice in my eating.
