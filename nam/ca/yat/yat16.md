XVII\. CHILDBIRTH AND DEATH.

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

"She is pregnant. Wait by my wife. She will be sick. She tells me, 'Go
and bring my mother!' She is always sick in the night, and I am afraid.
I shall not go about, I shall always stay at home. 'You shall not go
about,' she says to me. She eats too much, perhaps her child will grow
too fast." "Yes!" (said her mother). "It seems she never listens to what
I tell her. Whenever she goes out of the house, I say, 'Do not look back
when you go outside. Your child will imitate that. Do not eat too much.
Your child might grow too quickly.'" She cried when she was told that.
"You should not tell me that. I do not feel any pain in my back."

Now she said, "I am sick." Four days elapsed, and the medicine-man was
sent for. (Her mother said,) "I can do no more. I am tired out now and
good for nothing. You always greatly doubt what I say. You girls do not
know anything. Being old, I give advice. It is I that always speak about
that.

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Would that she
took my advice to herself!" Now the medicine-man came. "What, pray,
shall I do to her? I do not know what to do (in such cases)." She was
very dry. "Hehe'?! What shall we do with her? Do you (women) press upon
her belly! <span id="fr_124"></span>[292](#fn_121.md) I am always afraid,
carefully I give counsel." "Please give me some water to drink!" (said
the pregnant girl).

"Let me see! Give her supporting sticks as a seat, and she shall get up.
Go clear around the house!" "Alas! I shall die," she said. "Step out, do
not be worried. You never take my advice to yourself. I know what I say,
that is why I tell it to you." Twice she ran around her house. Now a fox
gives a bad omen, a fox talks before daybreak, and she sat down again on
the supporting sticks.

"Oh! What have I done to you?" (said her mother). The husband wept in
the woods. (Her mother said to him,) "Now! Go up on the mountain! <span
id="fr_125"></span>[293](#fn_122.md) Build a fire, break off spruce twigs
and put them down, and get pine needles!" Now he was building a fire. He
flew about busily at his work, his heart being very joyful (with hope).
Yonder is he, who has gone far off building the fire. He came back at
midnight. "How did she get along?" "She is about to die," (said her
mother). "Her mouth is all dry." Suddenly she died.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[188:292](yat16.htm#fr_124.md) A woman in
confinement did not lie down, but was always seated, while one of the
women in attendance sat behind her, gently pressing upon her belly in
order to hasten the delivery.
