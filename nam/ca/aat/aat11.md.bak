### 10. COYOTE AND CLOUD (ACHOMAWI).

Coyote and Cloud ran a race. Cloud bet storm, and Coyote clear weather.
They started far away to the south, and for a while Coyote was in the
lead. Then Cloud made fruits of all kinds to grow in front of Coyote;
and he, looking back and seeing Cloud far behind, stopped to eat. In
this way Cloud caught up and won. This is why we have storms in
winter-time.
