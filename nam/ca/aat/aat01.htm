<P>THE following myths were secured during the summers of 1900 and 1903, while engaged in work among the tribes of northeastern California for the Huntington Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History. Some were secured in text, but nearly half were obtained only in brief form in English. The last myths are from the Atsugewi or Hat Creek Indians, the remainder from the Achomawi or Pit River tribe. Both tribes form part of the Shastan stock, of which the Shasta are perhaps the best-known members. My chief informants were, among the former Charley Snook, and among the latter Charley Green and "Old Wool."</P>
