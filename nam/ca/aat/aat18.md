### 4. THE HOUSE OF SILVER-FOX

When Silver-Fox left this world, he said to his sweat-house, "Nobody
shall ever come in here," and he left a strong wind there to guard the
place. No one dares go near this place, for a whirlwind blows up out of
it, makes a noise like thunder, and only shamans can go near; but
whoever enters is immediately turned to stone inside. Wolf and
Silver-Fox left their power of wind there. Even now, wolves will catch
people that come near; and whoever gets inside, turns to white rock.

Once a great shaman dreamed of a wolf that was in that sweathouse. He
went in. As soon as he got inside, the wind stopped. He went around
inside and vomited blood. He said it was an immense sweathouse, as much
as a mile across inside. When he came out, he fell down nearly dead.
Another shaman cured him. He had seen nothing inside but men turned to
stone. Next night this shaman's hair turned as white as snow.
