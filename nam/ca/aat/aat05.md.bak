### 4. SEARCH FOR FIRE (ACHOMAWI).

After Hawk had been killed, and the flood had subsided, people found
that all fires were put out all over the world. Nothing could be cooked,
but for a time people did not trouble about it. Then after a few days
they began to talk about it, and sent Owl to Mount Shasta to look all
over the world and see if he could find any trace of fire. Owl took a
feather blanket and went. Lizard watched him go, and told the people how
he was getting on. After a while, when Owl did not come back, people
thought he was dead. But Lizard said, "Sh! I can still see him." Owl got
to the top at last, very tired, and wet with sweat. Lizard saw him look
all about. He looked west twice, and there saw smoke coming from a
sweat-house. After a while Owl came down from the mountain, and, coming
back, told people what he had seen.

Next morning all got ready and went off to the west, to where the smoke
had been seen. Every one had a cedar-bark torch. Dog had some punk
hidden in his car. Late in the evening they arrived at the house, and
asked to be allowed to warm their hands. Dog held his ear down, and fire
caught in the punk. Then every one thrust their torches into the fire,
and ran. The people in the house were angry, and struck at them as they
ran off. Coyote's fire gave out first, then another's and another's,
until finally all were out except that which Dog had in his ears. The
people who owned fire had made it rain, and this put out the people's
torches. No one knew that Dog had fire. They got home and were much
troubled, for they thought the fire had all been lost. Dog was laughing,
and said, "I am sweating." Coyote got angry at this, and said, "Hit him!
Knock him out!" Then Dog said to Fox, "Look in my ear." When he did so,
he saw the fire. He took out the punk, made fire from it, and so people
got fire again.
