### 6. THE LOST BROTHER (ACHOMAWI).

Fisher and his brother Weasel were living together. One day Lizard stole
Weasel, and carried him off, and Fisher hunted in vain for him. As he
went about searching, he kicked up the earth, and so made the mountains.
One day some Mice came to Fisher's house as he lay asleep. They came to
get some meat from a deer he had killed. They cried and talked at the
same time, throwing dust in their eyes for grief. Fisher gave the Mice
some meat, and told them how his brother had been stolen by Lizard while
gathering wood. The Mice said that they thought he could find his
brother again somehow. Then Fisher asked them to help, to go and ask Sun
where he was. He promised to give them feathers and beads and paint to
give Sun. The Mice agreed to go, and, taking a long cord, tied it to an
arrow and shot it up to the sky, where it stuck firmly. Fisher then gave
them the gifts he had promised, told them to ask Sun if he had seen
where Weasel was, for he could see all over the world. If Sun did not
answer at first, they were not to be discouraged, but to go on ahead of
him along the road he travelled in the sky, and ask him again.

The Mice started, and climbed up to the sky, to the road on which Sun
travelled. He came along, carrying his daughter on his back in a basket.
The Mice asked him to stop, said that they had come to see him, and had
brought presents from Fisher, who wished to know where his brother had
been taken to. Sun did not answer, but walked steadily on. So the Mice
ran ahead and asked again, and then Sun stopped. He said he could not
see Weasel, but that a man lived far away at Baiwa, that he had no
children, yet he could see him with a little white boy, which might be
Weasel. The Mice said that they were sure it was, and gave the gifts to
Sun, after which they came back down the rope to Fisher's house.

The Mice told Fisher all that they had done, and said that Sun had said
that Lizard had a small boy with him, who might be Weasel. Fisher
thanked them, and sent them away. He felt happy, for he knew where his
brother was. He built a fire, took out his arrows and dried them, and in
the morning started off to where Lizard lived. Lizard went out to catch
ducks; and when he left, he told Weasel to stay behind in the house and
watch his bow and arrows. As Fisher came near, he caused trees to grow
in front of him to conceal his approach. Weasel had gone out to get some
wood, and saw his brother. He was glad to

find him; and they talked together, and decided how to escape. Weasel
made a great fire in the house, and then took Lizard's bow and arrows
and threw them in, then joined Fisher, and the two ran off. Lizard was
looking back, and saw the big fire in his house, and came back in a
hurry to see what was the trouble. He found his weapons burned, all but
a few arrows. These he took, and started after the two brothers. They
and Lizard travelled very fast, as they snapped themselves from one
mountain-top to another by means of an arrow-flaker. Fisher tried to
escape, but Lizard always got in front of him. So at last they fought.
Fisher put Weasel in his quiver and fought as hard as he could, but by
and by got very tired. Every now and then Weasel would pop his head out
and say, "He nearly hit you then! Be careful, brother!" Toward sundown
Fisher was very tired, and looked to see where Bluejay was. He was out
stalking deer with a deer-head on as disguise, and, seeing deer, he was
creeping up on them, and did not see the conflict. The deer were
startled by it, however, and ran; and Bluejay, looking up, saw Fisher
retreating backwards toward him. Bluejay was an older brother of
Fisher's, and came to his aid, and succeeded in hitting Lizard in the
belly, when he burst in two and was killed. Then Fisher stood up, and
wiped the sweat from him, and went home with Bluejay and Weasel.
