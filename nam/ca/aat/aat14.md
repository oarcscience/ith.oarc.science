# ACHOMAWI MYTHS

## COLLECTED BY JEREMIAH CURTIN; EDITED BY ROLAND B. DIXON

\[NOTE.--The following myths were collected by Jeremiah Curtin for the
Bureau of American Ethnology. They were placed in my hands by the Editor
for preparation for insertion in this Journal; and in so doing, I have
made no changes other than to give the English names for the various
characters, and to add a word or two here and there, where the original
manuscript was obscure or imperfect because of hasty copying. One myth
has been omitted from the series, as it is only a brief version of the
Loon-Woman myth already published in this journal, vol. xxi, p. 165.--R.
B. DIXON.\]
