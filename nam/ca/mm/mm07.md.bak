OUNDED in 1776, the year of American Independence, this Mission, still
standing in the heart of the great City of San Francisco was a familiar
landmark when the great gold rush of the "Days of ‘49" was in full
swing. Almost since its establishment it has been popularly known as
"Mission Dolores" probably for the reason that it was founded on the
church calendar day of Our Mother of Sorrows. It escaped untouched, as
though by a miracle, the great fire of 1906.
