LD San Gabriel Mission with its picturesque bell tower and its
exquisitely beautiful outer stairway, worn by the bare feet of the
Indian neophytes, was founded in the year 1771 and is distant nine miles
from the center of the City of Los Angeles. San Gabriel became the
richest of the Missions and was called "The Queen of the Missions." It
is here that the "Mission Play" is given each year in a magnificent
playhouse by a great company of Indian and white performers numbering
over one hundred persons.
