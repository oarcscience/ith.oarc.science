# 6. THUNDER-BOY AND LIZARD-MAN.

In the north, it is said, there were many first people. One house was
full of people, and they went hunting. One man went off and did not
return by night. Then next day his brother went to look for him. And he
went off, going along the ridge; and in the morning, again he had not
come back. Then again some one went to look for him; and he, not
returning, they ceased (going off).

"I don't know what is the trouble! I again (also) will go and look for
him," said one. And he, in the morning, after he had had his breakfast
and made ready his bow, went off. And he did not return. "What can be
the trouble?" said one. "Do you go and look for him, taking good care."
Then (another) went.

Again he did not come back. "They are trying to destroy us," they said;
and again one went to search, and did not return at night. Then, "You
must be careful," said his father. Again one went off, and did not
return at night. The people were half gone.

"Do the best you can, live through it," said he. "Whatever can be the
trouble? I will go and see," he said. "If I do not get back, do the best
you can, ye people. What can be the trouble? While we are out hunting
for food, for game, (some one) I don't know who it is, sees us, and
troubles us. What man can it be?" he said.

So he went off, and did not return. Another one went off afterwards, and
he also did not return. Then the old man said, "I will go last. Do you
go first," said he. So the last and only one left alive went. And at
night again he was not apparent. Then again the old man went. "Do ye
stay," said he. "Don't let the child run about." So (the latter) and his
elder sister staid there. The old

man did not come back. Then they two remained there alone. "You must
remain without crawling outside," said she. "What is it that is
destroying us people? Do you know "Do not go out! You must play about
close by here, not going far away," said she. Then be replied, "Very
well."

Then she said, "Bring some wood!" and he went to bring it. By and by he
brought some back. He carried a large piece, although he was small, he
carried a large piece. She sent him again. "You must not carry a large
piece! It might hurt you," she said,

Then he went for wood. "Do not go far," she said. But he went a little
farther, and brought back a very large, very pitchy (log). "Didn't I
tell you not to carry (such a large one)?" said she. "You might hurt
yourself in the chest. That is what I told you," she said.

He had big eyes, they say; and, "Although (I am) small, I am going to
see," he thought. "What, I wonder, does this!" he said. "Look here, my
sister! I want to go and look."--"I have told you not to say such
things," she said. Next morning she sent him to get wood, and he went.
He brought back a pitch stump, a whole one. Then, "I wonder how it is
that carrying such loads . . .," thought his sister. "Although he is
indeed very small, (yet) he carries great loads," she thought,

Next morning he went off. He went, going along the ridge, and came to a
great flat place. And human bones were many there. Standing there, he
looked all about. By and by a man approached. "What are you doing?" said
he. "Nothing," (the boy) replied. "Do you want to fight?" said he.
"Yes," said the boy. Thereupon they two wrestled, and the boy killed
Lizard-Man.

Thereupon he returned, and arrived at the house. He bathed in warm
water, and then spoke. "I am going off above," said he. "You must
remain, you must stay here. Rising from here, I shall go over up to the
Above-Valley; and when I reach there, I will thunder," said he. "I shall
roar, and you shall hear me."

Whereupon, having finished speaking to his sister, he started and went
off. And a while after he had gone, it thundered. He was roaring, they
say. He it was who was to be the Thunder-Man. His sister recognized him
again. At that time he said, "I shall have my country there. You must
remain here. Meanwhile I shall be continually travelling about in the
Above-Valley." So he spoke. That is all. "There are many squinting women
gathering tules." <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md)
