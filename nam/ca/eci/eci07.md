### IMPLEMENTS OF WOOD AND FIBRE.

A bow and two or three arrows will frequently be found in a Cahuilla
house. They are used for small game. As Dr. Barrows has said, the bow is
apt to be shown with an apology and an explanation of the superior
qualities of those made by the forefathers. Both bow and arrow are of
the same type as those of the Mohave. The bow is usually of willow. The
University collections however contain one made of harder wood, perhaps
mesquite, and another made from the stem of a palm leaf. According to
Dr. Barrows the bows of former days, at any rate the better

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

ones, were made of mesquite. <span id="fr_20"></span>[18](#fn_19.md) At the
present day bows are all four to four and a half feet long, an inch and
an eighth or an inch and a quarter wide, and three-quarters to
seven-eighths of an inch in greatest thickness. The better made ones are
roughly squared in cross section. Others are more rounded, and some of
these are still covered with red willow-bark on the back or outside. One
specimen is nothing but the split half of a willow stick. No sinew
backing has been found. There is very little taper in either width or
thickness from the middle of the bow to the ends. This comparatively
long, narrow, and thick unbacked bow, most frequently made of willow,
corresponds exactly with the Mohave bow. The string is still
occasionally made of mescal fibre or sinew, but more modern substitutes,
including iron wire, are common.

The arrows are of two types, being made either of a straight shaft of
wood sharpened at the end, or of cane with a wooden foreshaft. The
wooden arrow is typical of the Mohave, while the cane arrow is
attributed by them to the neighboring Chemehuevi and Paiute of
Shoshonean stock. At the present day the wooden arrow seems more
frequent among the Cahuilla. Being used only for small game, neither
form has a stone or metal point. It is not unlikely that such may have
been the custom also in old days, even in the case of arrows intended
for war. The Mohave state that stone arrow-points were not regularly
used by them, and that their ordinary war arrow was the simple sharpened
shaft of wood. They appear to regard the stone arrow-point as typical of
their Shoshonean neighbors.

The Cahuilla wooden arrow is said by Dr. Barrows to be made from
wormwood, *Artemisia ludoviciana*. This is similar to the plant used by
the Mohave, *Pluchea sericea*. The arrow is about three feet long. One
end is sharpened, the other notched and feathered. All the arrows seen
had only two feathers. This may be due to their-being intended only for
small game. The Mohave used a two-feather arrow for similar inferior
purposes, but a three-feathered one for war. The feathering on the
Cahuilla arrows is applied as follows: a feather is split down the
quill; each half is then laid against opposite sides of the shaft

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

and the ends fastened down by a sinew wrapping. Each half-feather is not
in line with the shaft but is given a quarter twist around it.

The cane arrow is similarly notched and feathered. It consists of three
or four joints of cane three-eighths or half an inch in diameter. At the
front end a piece of wood is let into the hollow cane, which is then
wrapped about with sinew. This piece of wood, which tapers to a point,
projects from the cane some six or eight inches. In a set with two
arrows of this type obtained at Banning is a third one, similarly made
but with a shaft of unjointed rush replacing the jointed cane. The cane
arrow is usually somewhat longer than the wooden one.

The digging stick of the Cahuilla calls for no special comment, being as
elsewhere merely a sharpened stick of hard wood. A specimen obtained is
four feet long and an inch and a half in diameter.

The Cahuilla flute, like that of all the Indians of California, is of
the entirely open variety. It consists of a piece of cane a foot and a
half long which can be looked through like a pipe. The mouth end is
ground or otherwise brought to an edge at an angle of about forty-five
degrees. There are four stops or holes of small size. Whether
consciously or unconsciously, these are grouped into two pairs, the
distance between the pairs, that is to say, between the two middle
holes, being somewhat greater than between the two holes in each pair.
Of two flutes in the University collections both show this grouping of
the stops. The distance between the stops varies from somewhat less than
two to somewhat more than two and a half inches. The distances are not
exactly equal, and yet not sufficiently varied to give any appearance of
design. It is not probable that they are constructed with any clear idea
of the dependence of tone intervals upon the distance between them, but
merely by eye or by some convenient rule of thumb. When played, the
flute is held against the mouth at somewhat of an angle, not taken
between the lips. The sound is produced by the column of air from the
mouth striking the sharpened upper edge. The melodies have a peculiarly
fascinating character. They are sweet and plaintive, though the tone
intervals are likely to be arbitrary.

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

So far as is at present known, the straight open flute is the only one
known in any part of aboriginal California. Only among the Mohave of the
Colorado river does a flageolet appear in addition.

A curved throwing stick used for rabbits and birds, and a war club of
potato-masher form, are mentioned by Dr. Barrows as having been used by
the Cahuilla. <span id="fr_21"></span>[19](#fn_20.md) Like the pottery,
they are of ethnographical interest in having been made both by the
Indians of Southern California and those of the Pueblo region.

The carrying net ([Pl. 11](eci12.htm#img_pl11).md) is an important Cahuilla
implement, still employed occasionally, and making it possible for the
Cahuilla to dispense with the deep conical burden basket found in most
other parts of California, as in the carrying net a shallower basket can
be conveniently transported. The net is made of string with meshes four
to five inches square. Among the Diegueño and Luiseño the carrying net
is smaller, the string slenderer, and the meshes finer. The general
shape of the net is that of a small broad hammock. At the two ends the
net is gathered on a ring or loop of heavier cord or rope. These loops
are six or eight inches in diameter. One of these rope rings has a loose
end several feet long. This is passed through the other loop to join the
net, much like a saddle cinch between its two rings. In this way the
size of the net can be increased or diminished. The wide portion of the
net, which is behind the back, contains the basket or object carried.
The rope passes over the basketry cap worn by the carrier. In the desert
the net seems all to be made of mescal-leaf fibre. In San Gorgonio pass
a softer glossy material is employed, a string made from "wish," given
by Dr. Barrows as the common reed, *Phragmites communis*. <span
id="fr_22"></span>[20](#fn_21.md)

Sandals of mescal fibre are still used, especially on the desert. ([Pl.
10](eci12.htm#img_pl10)..md) They are said to be worn principally by men
when out-doors at night. These sandals consist of a half-inch pad of
mescal fibres held to the foot with strips of the same fibre, or by
thongs. They serve as an efficient protection against

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

thorns. The manner of construction is not quite clear. It would appear
that the fibres are bent around a cord which follows the outline of the
foot, and are in some way joined or fastened along the middle of the
sandal. There is no distinct weave or textile process. Among six or
eight different forms of sandal in the University collections from cliff
dwellings in southern Utah and Colorado ([Pl. 12](eci12.htm#img_pl12).md),
there is none resembling this Cahuilla form. All these cliff-dweller
sandals are made by some method of basketry or cord weaving. The strings
which hold the Cahuilla sandal to the foot are not tied each time the
sandal is worn, but are so arranged that the foot can be slipped into
them. The strings in front pass on the two sides of the second toe, or
of the second and third toes. The general arrangement is shown in the
illustration.

A similar sandal, but of rawhide instead of mescal fibre, was obtained
from the Chemehuevi at Cabezon. A loop of string at the back of this
sandal serves as a heel strap. At the front there are two cords. These
are passed on the two sides of the second toe. They are then crossed,
brought backward, and passed under the heel strap, brought forward
again, and tied over the instep.

A third form of footwear consists of a high moccasin of soft skin
without ornament. A pair of such moccasins was secured from the Cahuilla
at Cabezon.

The familiar California soaproot-fibre brush used for cleaning baskets
of meal, and also as a comb, is not a Cahuilla implement. Dr. Barrows
mentions brushes of mescal. fibre. <span id="fr_23"></span>[21](#fn_22.md)
The Serrano at San Manuel use the soaproot brush, but the Luiseño,
Diegueño, and Mohave agree with the Cahuilla in making their brushes of
other materials than this. <span id="fr_24"></span>[22](#fn_23.md) The only
other tribes in California known not to use a form of soaproot brush,
are the Porno and southern Wintun, who employ anise-root fibres for this
purpose. <span id="fr_25"></span>[23](#fn_24.md)
