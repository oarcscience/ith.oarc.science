The language which the Indians of this mission speak is the

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Man dialect. It is
so called because they say faâ for yes and man for no. <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md)

They have a great desire to assemble at a ceremony regarding a bird
called vulture (gavilan). This ceremony begins with a search anxiously
made for this bird, and they invite one another to seek it. This arises
from the fact that there are at the mission certain keen neophytes, who,
however, are lazy when it comes to work, such as gathering the seeds on
which they live. Desiring to have what they can feast with, these have
made use of the opportunity of hunting the said bird in order to seduce
the more simple-minded ones. They tell them that this bird is a person,
who can free them from their enemies and bestow upon them whatever they
ask of him. However false this belief, they hold to it with great
pertinacity, wherefore they cherish the bird with as much care as the
best mother could show for her son. As soon as they have captured it,
they bring it the best of what they have obtained in the hunt and in
their food gathering. When it is well nourished, and grown, they kill
it, and for its funeral they burn it. While it is in the bonfire, those
who have assembled offer to it seeds, beads, and whatever they esteem
most. In the following year they search for another vulture, and do the
same with it. The means which has been found for separating them from
these follies, is to set some good Indians to watch, and to chastise
severely and in public those who gather for the occasion. <span

Although this land is favored with many medicinal herbs, they do not use
them nor did they ever use them. <span id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) There
are certain

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

neophytes who are sagacious but very bad workers. <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) These persuade the others that they can cure
them. Such are called guisyay, that is to say, wizard. Their method of
doctoring is this. When they know that someone is sick, the patient goes
to the cusiyay <span id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) or his relatives call
him. This one takes in his mouth a stick or piece of wood or skin. . He
turns to the part of the body which is in pain and begins to draw and
suck it. When he removes his mouth, he shows to the patient what he has
been carrying in it, persuading him that it was this which hurt him.
With this the patient remains much calmed and contented, believing that
he is already free from his sickness. From this it is to be inferred
that their, greatest physical infirmity, and that which most destroys
them, is melancholy or fear; <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) but the
most common illness among them is venereal sickness. <span
id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) Since four years there have been more deaths
than baptisms. In this last year of 1814 the dead numbered one hundred
and eighteen, those baptized seventy-five, adult pagans baptized being
included in the latter number.

 

They are exceedingly desirous (apasionados) of preserving the customs of
their elders. <span id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) They say that they came
to these lands from the north. <span id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md)

 

They do not observe any ceremony in their funerals. All that they do,
and that by the affected indifference of the missionaries, is to throw
some seeds in the shroud of the dead. They do this with loud weeping,
which they keep up for some days.}

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

The Indians (indiada) are much inclined to pride and rancor. The men
pursue one another with death for jealousies and other vexations. When
the women are angry with their husbands, or these have become attached
to other women, they revenge themselves for their injuries by depriving
themselves of life. <span id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md)

No other idolatry is found among them than the vulture ceremony which
has been described. The rite which they use in their funerals is to burn
the body. While it is blazing, they throw seeds on the fire and cry out
to the accompaniment of floods of tears, which may continue for days or
even months. <span id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md)

These Indians do not have, nor did they have, any musical instruments,
except a sonajilta (timbrel) of a disagreeable sound. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1"></span>[3:2](mrci02.htm#fr_1.md) The replies made to the
interrogatory from San Diego were probably received too late to be
incorporated with the other reports, for they are found separate in
another part of the Archives, volume III, page 27, of the Miscellaneous
Papers. The fathers in charge of San Diego about 1814 were Fernando
Martin and Jose Sanchez, according to Engelhardt's Franciscans in
California, from which the data of a similar nature given below are also
taken.

San Diego is the southernmost of the Franciscan missions of Upper
California, the earliest founded, and the only one in the territory of
the Yuman linguistic stock. From it are named the Diegueños, or Yuman
Mission Indians, who survive today to the number of several hundred.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[4:3](mrci02.htm#fr_2.md) This designation of the
language does not appear to have survived. The Diegueño word for yes is
e, or khan, good, and for no, umau or arkhamau. Man should therefore
probably be read Mau. The sound f does not occur in the Yuman languages.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[4:4](mrci02.htm#fr_3.md) Drastic; but if we
remember that it was not the fathers’ business to sympathize with the
Indian's civilization or to study it, but to bring him, for his own
supposed good, to another way of living and thinking, our censure will
not be severe, however such practices conflict with modern principles.
The bird, as among the neighboring Luiseño, is more probably the eagle
than the California condor, which the word gavilan properly indicates;
the ceremony is an annual one, common to most of the Mission Indians of
Southern California, and held in memory of the dead. The San Luis Rey
report describes the ceremony more fully.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[4:5](mrci02.htm#fr_4.md) This is probably an
extreme statement, but it is well known that Indian medicine depends far
more on ceremonial or shamanistic practices, such as the sucking
described below, than on any pharmaceutical remedies.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[5:6](mrci02.htm#fr_5.md) It will be seen that the
father has a fondness for giving this explanation of Indian religious
practices that meet his disapproval.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[5:7](mrci02.htm#fr_6.md) Probably the same as
guisyay above. The word has been obtained as kwisiayu by the author.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[5:8](mrci02.htm#fr_7.md) An interesting
confirmation of an opinion held by many ethnologists regarding most
people that are primitive.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[5:9](mrci02.htm#fr_8.md) Needless to say, derived
from the whites. The virulence of this disease among the Indians would
be sufficient evidence of its newness to them, even if this fact were
not confirmed by general contemporary statement.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[5:10](mrci02.htm#fr_9.md) The Indians of Yuman
family probably show this trait more strongly than any others in
California.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[5:11](mrci02.htm#fr_10.md) The common tradition of
the Indians of Southern California, except the Mohave, who derive their
first origin from the west. The Indians of Lower California are also
said to have believed that they came from the north.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[6:12](mrci02.htm#fr_11.md) Suicide among many
Indians is most frequent among women disappointed in love.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[6:13](mrci02.htm#fr_12.md) Cremation was the mode
of disposing of the dead in vogue, at the time of discovery and
settlement, among the Indians of Lower California and all of southern
Upper California except the Chumash. Numerous burials have been found in
Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, and on the Santa Barbara islands;
but from about Los Angeles south, and eastward across the state, the
scarcity of human remains is such as to be conclusive evidence of the
prevalence of cremation, even were the confirmatory evidence of
observers lacking. Under mission influence, of course, graves soon
replaced the funeral pyre.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[6:14](mrci02.htm#fr_13.md) Drums are not known
from Southern California, though baskets were sometimes beaten or
scraped. Rattles were of turtle-shell or gourd.
