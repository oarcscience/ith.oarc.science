#### *Santa Ynez*. <span id="fr_38"></span>[38](#fn_38.md)

When the rancherias were still inhabited by unconverted Indians, there
could be seen in various places bunches of feathers or plumes attached
to sticks, which might be called their idol-temples (adoratorios). There
they cast seeds and beads in order to obtain good harvests of acorns and
other seeds which the fields produce of themselves, and which were their
daily nourishment.

They neither knew or used any other musical instrument than a tube of
wood resembling a flute, open at both ends and producing a buzzing quite
disagreeable to hear; also a whistle (pito) of a limb-bone of some bird.
