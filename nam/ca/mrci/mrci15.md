#### *Santa Clara*. <span id="fr_62"></span>[62](#fn_62)

There are three languages at this mission, two of them related (bastante
parecidos), and the third, which is of the east, totally distinct.

 

Sometimes they bury the dead, sometimes burn them. <span
id="fr_63"></span>[63](#fn_63) As to whether they place food with them,
we believe that they do not.

 

They do not know any distinction of superiority. Only in war do they
obey the chief, and the wizards and magicians in matters of
superstition. In everything else everyone does what he pleases. In their
dissensions and disputes the strongest party wins.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_62"></span>[26:62](mrci15.htm#fr_62) Santa Clara is in
Costanoan territory, but it is probable that Miwok or Yokuts Indians
were brought here as they were brought to San Jose and San Juan
Bautista. It is in this way that the third and totally distinct language
mentioned is to be explained. The missionaries at Santa Clara in 1811
were Magin Catalá and Jose Viader.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[26:63](mrci15.htm#fr_63) It would appear from
the San Francisco account below, and from other evidence, that burning
was the more customary.
