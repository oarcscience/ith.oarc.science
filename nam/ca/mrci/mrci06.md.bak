*A Mission Record of the California Indians*, by A.L. Kroeber, \[1908\],
at Intangible Textual Heritage

#### *San Fernando*.

The Indians of this mission speak three distinct tongues. <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md)

 

The foods which they use are acorns; pine-nuts; chia (seeds of sage),
called pasill in their language; islai, called chamiso by

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

them; and numberless others. Of meat they eat deer, coyote, antelope,
jackrabbit, rabbit, ground-squirrel, rat, dog, all birds, moles (topos),
snakes, and rattlesnakes; and those of the coast are fond of all kinds
of fish, especially whale. <span id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md)

 

The musical instruments which they use are a flute of elder, certain
little sticks, and whistles of deer bones. <span
id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md)

 

Nowadays they do not burn the dead as they did at the beginning of the
conquest; but they do still put seeds with them at burial.

When an unconverted Indian dies, they make a deep hole for him. Into
this they put a pot, a basket, an otter skin, and some two or three
pesos worth of beads, above these the dead body, and this they cover
with earth. Then they immediately give notice to all the villages of the
district, that all, old, young, and children, are to paint for a general
feast. In this feast every kind of seeds and meat is served, and the
chief commands all most rigorously never to name the deceased, in order
that he may not come to annoy them (arrastrarlos). Note: All should
arrive weeping. At the end they burn the house and everything that the
deceased possessed.

 

We have observed the following superstitions. In order that their faces
may not be burned, they paint themselves with red ochre (almagre) and
other colors. In order not to become tired in climbing hills, they carry
a stick or stone. To hunt deer, they drink salt water and a plant which
the Spanish call toloache and they manit. With this they intoxicate
themselves. They take it in order to make themselves strong, to receive
injury from nothing (tomer a nadie), that the rattlesnakes may not bite
them, the bears not chew them, and that arrows may not enter their
bodies.

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

According to information their gods are five and one goddess. They are
called Veat, Taimur, Chuquit, Pichurut, and Iuichepet, husband of the
goddess Manisar, and she is the one who gives them their seeds. <span
id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md)

 

The best known medicines are:

Vespibat. <span id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) This is composed of wild
tobacco, lime, and oxide of iron (orinas) mixed together, which ferment.
They take it to relieve themselves of pain in the stomach, as well as
for wounds.

Chuchupate (an umbelliferous plant), called cayat in their language.
This is a plant which on every stalk has three round leaves, each with a
spike in the middle. The flower is white. They chew the root and rub
themselves gently where they suffer pain. They also use it for headache.

With the anise plant they purge themselves.

With the herb called del pasmo (convulsion) they drive away toothache of
the molars. When cooked they take it to sweat, and when crushed as snuff
(como polvo de tabaco).

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

Chilicote (*Echinocystis macrocarpa*), called yjaihix in the native
language, they use mixed with dust of the stone called pafa, or paheasa
in native dialect. They employ this for reducing inflammation, for
driving away cataracts (nubes de los ojos), for wounds, to bring on
menstruation, to cure themselves of urinary sickness, and boiled they
take it to sweat (humederse).

Those who suffer from venereal humors, the syphilitic (convenerados),
and the crippled, purge with mingled dust of alum stone and copperas
(piedra alumbre y alcaparrosa).

When they feel heavy they bleed themselves with a flint. When they are
restless they refresh themselves with water from the bark of the ash
tree.

When they suffer side pains they take red live ants in water, and apply
them alive externally, and strike themselves with nettles. <span
id="fr_35"></span>[35a](#fn_35.md)

They do not drink thermal waters, but they do bathe in them.

Among their principal diseases is syphilis (humor galico), of which a
considerable number die. They are most often sick in the spring.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_30"></span>[12:31](mrci06.htm#fr_30.md) While the Indians of
San Fernando have been called Fernandeños or Fernandinos, their dialect
was little different from that of San Gabriel, and the general term
Gabrielino can be applied to both. There were also Serrano Indians at
San Fernando. In fact it seems not unlikely that they may have been as
numerous as the Gabrielino-speaking natives there. What the third
language was which is mentioned as having been spoken at this mission,
can only be conjectured. It is not unlikely that it was Chumash, for it
is but a few miles westward from San Fernando to Chumash territory. The
missionaries at San Fernando who might have written the present account
were Martin de Landaeta, Jose Antonio Urresti, and Pedro Muñoz.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[13:32](mrci06.htm#fr_31.md) Chia, pasil, has been
mentioned above. With "islai, called chamiso by them," compare R. S.
Sparkman's "*Primus ilicifolia*, Luiseño chamish, Spanish islaya." It is
interesting that the bear is not given in the list of animals eaten.
Many California Indians refrain from eating the bear on account of its
human resemblance. Some did not eat the coyote, and those of
northwestern California regarded dog meat as virulent poison.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[13:33](mrci06.htm#fr_32.md) The "certain little
sticks" may have been rattles made of a partly split stick, after the
manner of a clap-stick. Such instruments were used by many California
tribes to accompany dance songs.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[14:34](mrci06.htm#fr_33.md) Unfortunately the
manuscript is not entirely clear. Chuquit may be read Chuguit or
Chugerit. Iuichepet may be Inichepet or possibly Quichepet. On page 372
of the second volume of this series of publications is given a prayer,
in the Yauelmani dialect of the Yokuts language, obtained from a man who
had lived at Tejon, in intercourse with the Shoshonean Indians there.
This prayer begins by calling on seven deities, whose names may be
rendered, in untechnical orthography, Töushiut, Bamashiut, Yokhakhait,
Echepat, Pitsuriut, Tsukit, and Ukat. Two or three of these terms look
as if they might be Yokuts, but the etymology of none can be certainly
explained in that language. The r in Pitsuriut is not found in Yokuts.
At least part of these Yokuts terms therefore appear to have been
borrowed from Shoshonean tribes. The names here given by the San
Fernando father show the source of this borrowing. Chuquit of the San
Fernando list is Yokuts Tsukit. Pichurut is Pitsuriut, and Iuichepet is
Echepat. Veat is clear in the manuscript, but is probably intended for
Vcat, that is, Ucat, with which the Yokuts Ukat would be identical.
Taimur and the goddess Manisar have no Yokuts equivalents, and the three
first names in the Yokuts list, Töushiut, Bamashiut, And Yokhakhait, do
not occur among the San Fernando names. A distinction seems to exist
among the Yokuts between these first three names and the borrowed four;
for in a formula spoken in the Yokuts jimson-weed ceremony, given on the
page following the prayer, only the first three are mentioned. The usual
ceremonial number of the Yokuts is not seven but six, the number of the
San Fernando deities. Ukat, the informant stated, was the sister of the
others. A Serrano recently seen at San Manuel reservation in Southern
California, mentioned six large stones that were once diosas, goddesses.
These stones are at Nanamüvyat, in or near Little Bear Valley, but he
had forgotten their names. The Yokuts correspondences make it more
likely that the six San Fernando deities were Serrano than Fernandeño
proper.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[14:35](mrci06.htm#fr_34.md) The word vespibat is
not otherwise known, but suggests pivat, tobacco, one of the components
of the medicine.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[15:35a](mrci06.htm#fr_35.md) Counter-irritants are
not infrequently used by other Indians. The Mohave burn themselves with
a glowing stick. Ants and nettles are used by the Luiseño and Juaneño as
an ordeal in the initiation ceremonies for boys.
