<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">COMMUNICATIONS</H3>
<P>The Indian was familiar with and practiced a rude method of telegraphy which consisted of smoke or fire signals flashed from one mountain top to another. In this manner they could readily communicate with each other and could spread important news over a large territory in a remarkably short time. There were several of these signal stations at suitable points around the Valley rim and in time of stress a watcher was on duty day and night.</P>
<P>In addition to the telegraph they practiced the foot relay system of runners in which they made use of their swiftest and strongest young men. These runners passing at top speed from village to village could spread news almost as rapidly as the smoke telegraph, and could, of course, transmit more detail than was possible by use of the signal fires.</P>
