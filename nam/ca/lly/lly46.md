### SWEAT-HOUSES

The sweat-houses, which were to be found in every village, were similar
in construction to the o-churn except that the top was rounded and the
entire structure coated

thickly with mud. A small opening was left at the bottom as an entrance
and another in the top for the egress of smoke. These houses were always
built near a stream or some body of water. One of the first steps in
their preparations for a big hunt was a thorough sweating and cleansing
in the sweat-house. This was done to free the brave of all bodily odors
so that the deer could not detect his approach by scent. After the
sweat-house had been heated to a high temperature by fires and hot rocks
the hunter crawled inside and the door was shut. There he remained until
in a welter of perspiration, when the door was opened and he rushed out
and plunged into the icy waters of the stream or lake. This operation
was repeated until they were satisfied all bodily odors had been
eliminated. The sweat-houses were also resorted to as a means of
treatment for various bodily ailments.
