### EL CAPITAN

Across The Gateway, facing Bridal Veil Fall, stands El Capitan, called
by the Indians, Tu-tok-a-nu-la, or "rock chief." To apply human
standards of measurement to this monarch of mountains is sacrilege. To
attempt by mere words and figures to convey some idea of its stupendous

massiveness, its nobly-defiant impressive individuality, is rankest
folly. Towering over thirty-six hundred feet above the Valley floor,
more than twice the height of Gibraltar, the world's largest and highest
rock, the world's most nearly perpendicular cliff, embracing on its
surface over three hundred and twenty acres of glacier-worn,
storm-beaten solid granite, the unspeakable grandeur, the preeminent
glory and strength, the air of unutterable age, irresistible power, and
infinite repose of El Capitan beggar description. Here this great "rock
chief" stands, the mightiest, the most glorious of his kind, keeping
perpetual vigil over the rock portals of his kingdom, and we can but bow
our heads in reverent awe to receive the benediction which he bestows
upon all who pass his throne.
