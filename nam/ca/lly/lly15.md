### YOSEMITE FALL

Opposite The Sentinel Rock, at a point nearly twenty-six hundred feet
above the Valley floor, Yosemite Creek pours its waters over the cliff
in the world's highest and most beautiful waterfall. Leaping the brow of
the cliff in a majestic torrent, surrounded by eddying mists of
iridescent color, the water goes hurtling down over fourteen hundred
feet in a sheer drop to the first bench of the fall. Here it gathers
itself for another rush, and after cascading for some six hundred feet,
takes another drop of three hundred feet into the seething basin below.
To attempt to describe the inexpressible beauty of Yosemite Fall is as
impossible as it is unnecessary. During the early months of the season
it is a truly awe inspiring sight. The immense volume of water from
melting snows in the higher reaches of the Sierras rushes over the brink
with irresistible force. The vibration of its thundering impact on the
rocks has been known to rattle windows in Yosemite Village nearly a mile
across the Valley, and the wind blown spray, shot with all the rainbow
colors, can be felt a quarter mile away.
