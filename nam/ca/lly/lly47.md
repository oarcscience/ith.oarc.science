### CLOTHING

The Indian being constantly exposed to the elements needed very little
clothing. It consisted, in the case of the man, of a breech-cloth made
of skins which was worn about the loins. For the woman it took the form
of a skirt which reached from the waist to the knee. These skirts were
usually made of dressed doe-skin, finished at the bottom with a slit
fringe, and sometimes decorated with bead or shell ornaments.

When on the hunt the brave sometimes wore a headgear of loosely woven
thongs of deerskin into which he would stick any feathers found on the
trails. These feathers were carried back to camp to be used in
fashioning the elegant head-dresses worn by the chiefs and headmen

of the tribes. Beads of teeth, or shell, were worn about the necks of
the women, as were beads made of adobe or clay. Both men and women
sometimes wore moccasins made of deerskin. Children of both sexes
usually went about entirely naked, or wore clothing fashioned after that
of their parents.
