This short book about Yosemite Valley and its original inhabitants was
written early in the 20th century. Of particular interest are the
photographs, which are all in the public domain; while not as gorgeous
as those taken in later years by Ansel Adams, they adequately convey the
magnificent landscape.

This book has a few factual inaccuracies, but only because of the limits
of contemporary knowledge. For instance, at the time of writing, Ribbon
Falls was thought to be the highest waterfall in the world; today we
know that Angel Falls in Venezuela has this distinction. Also, the small
but signficant survival of Chinese Redwoods was likewise unknown at the
time, so we can today qualify the statement that this tree only exists
in California. However, for the most part this book is fairly accurate;
in particular, the geological description is not obsolete.

The core of this book is a description of the beliefs and material
culture of the Miwok of Yosemite, and the disgraceful history of their
ejection from the valley. The historical and ethnographic information is
fairly accurate; in contrast, the information on religion is the
thinnest part of this book. Wilson writes of a 'Great Spirit'; as far as
I know, this is not a part of Miwok beliefs. There is no concept of an
overarching deity. Rather, Miwok mythology revolves around Coyote and
the other animal-people inhabitants of the dreamtime.
