### WEAPONS

The bow, which was the principal weapon used by the Indian, and which
was used both in hunting and in warfare, was made of cedar or oak,
usually about three feet in length, two inches wide in the center and
tapering to the ends, rounded on the inside and covered with the sinews
of the deer. These sinews were applied wet and allowed to dry and
contract, which gave to the bow added strength and elasticity. The
strings were made from the thongs of the deer, and when not in use, the
bow was unstrung, thereby retaining its strength for a longer period.

The arrows were made principally from the wood of the sour-berry bush,
which is found in the Merced

\[paragraph continues\] Canyon below the Valley. After the bark was
removed and the wood scraped down to size, it was dried and seasoned in
the shade, and made straight by frequent rubbing between two hardwood
sticks. When ready for the heads a V-shaped notch was cut in the heavy
end of the shaft into which was fitted the arrowhead of obsidian, or
volcanic glass, which was bound on with the fibre of the milkweed
overlaid with a coating of pitch to make it more secure.

The making of the arrowheads was a fine art requiring great skill and
patience and was the especial business of a few of the older men of the
tribe. The butt of the shaft was fitted with the halves of three
feathers laid on lengthwise and bound with milkweed fibre. These were
supposed to add to the accuracy of the arrow, as well as to the length
of its flight. On account of the scarcity of suitable wood and the
difficulty of preparing it, these arrows were only used in warfare and
in the hunting of larger game, and were used as often as they could be
recovered after being discharged. Those used in practice and in the
hunting of smaller game were not fitted with heads, but were merely
pointed shafts of fire hardened wood. The obsidian from which the
arrowheads were made was obtained in commerce from the Mo-no Indians in
the region of Mo-no Lake.

The Indians also fashioned hammers and picks from stone and from the
horns of deer, which they bound to handles with thongs of deerskin.
These hammers and picks were used in chipping the obsidian to the fine
edge required for arrowheads, in the digging of their grasshopper
trenches, and other work about the camps.
