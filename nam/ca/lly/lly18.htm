<P>Facing Half Dome across Te-na-ya Canyon stands North Dome, called by the Indians, because of its resemblance to an upturned water basket, To-ko-ya, or "water basket." In the formation of North Dome and its neighbor, Basket Dome, the observant may read the record left by the glaciers during the ages when America was in the making. Two perfect domes, glacier polished, glistening, rising side by side above Washington Column and The Royal Arches, they are conspicuous from nearly the entire floor of the Valley.</P>
<P>Just below Washington Column and near The Royal Arches, the adventurous explorer will find an old cave formed by the talus from the surrounding cliffs. Into these caves members of the Mariposa Battalion, when on their second expedition into the Valley in 1851, pursued a band of hostile Indians.

<P>Lying inside near the mouth of the cave may be seen a large block of granite, which still bears marks of its use by the artisans of long ago as an anvil in the fashioning of their arrowheads and tomahawks.</P>
