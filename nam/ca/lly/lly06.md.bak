### THE GATEWAY

The varying emotions with which mere man greets his first view of
Yosemite Valley, like human nature itself, run the scale from flippancy
to tears of awe and reverence. Any attempt to describe the unutterable
grandeur and sublimity of the scene unrolled before him only serves to
demonstrate the pitiful inadequacy of our language to measure up to such
a task. Well might Hutchings say, "When the painter's art can build the
rainbow upon canvas so as to deceive the sense of sight--when simple
words can tell the depth and height, the length and breadth, of a single
thought--or the metaphysician's skill delineate, beyond peradventure,
the hidden mysteries of a living soul--then, ah! then, it may be
possible."

It is utterably beyond the power of language to convey any impression of
the awe-inspiring majesty of the walls of solid granite that enclose the
Valley on every side, darkly frowning and seemingly overhanging, as
though to threaten with instant annihilation any who denied their power.
If man ever feels his utter insignificance, his infinitesimal importance
as a mere atom in the scheme of things, it should be when gazing upon
this scene of appalling grandeur so charmingly blended with transcendent
loveliness.

Before you, as you enter the gateway, winds the beautiful Merced River,
singing on its way from its source in the snow-capped peaks of the high
Sierra to its ultimate destination in the bosom of the Father of Oceans,
while flanking the river is a grass-carpeted, flower-strewn meadow, the
sight of which is as a benediction among all the impressive magnificence
of its setting.
