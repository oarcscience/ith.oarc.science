### BEDDING

Their underbedding was usually made from the skins of the larger animals
such as the deer and bear. Their coverings were robes made from the
skins of the smaller fur bearing animals. These were made by cutting the
fur into narrow strips, which were loosely twisted so as to bring the
fur entirely around on the outside, and weaving them into a warp made
from the tough bark of the milkweed. These robes were very warm and were
used as clothing when traveling in cold weather.
