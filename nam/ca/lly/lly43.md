### SMALL GAME, MUSHROOMS, WORMS, AND BEETLES

Small game, such as rabbits, squirrels, and birds, were killed for food,
as well as for their hides and feathers, which were used in the making
of arrows, bedding and clothing, and ornaments. Mushrooms and the fungus
of the oak were also eaten, as were worms, grubs, beetles, and the
larvae of ants and other insects.
