### GRASSHOPPERS

Grasshoppers were a favorite food of the Indian, being regarded as a
delicacy. To catch them a trench was dug across the center of a meadow
and a fire built in the trench into which rocks were thrown. After the
fire had burned to glowing embers the Indians formed in line on each
side of the meadow and with the aid of brushes and much yelling, drove
the grasshoppers into the trench, where they were automatically roasted
on the hot coals and rocks. They were then eaten in that form, or
crushed and beaten into a paste and mixed with other edibles. If desired
for winter use they were dried in the sun and stored away in the cache.
Grasshoppers were also caught and eaten raw.
