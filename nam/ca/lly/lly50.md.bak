# CHAPTER VIII

### HIS CUSTOMS, RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, AND CEREMONIES

<span id="img_11000"></span> ![](img/11000.jpg) The Yo-sem-i-tes, as is
true of nearly all Indian tribes, were of an intensely religious
temperament. They seem to have had a fairly well defined idea of a
Deity, known as The Great Spirit, who looked after their welfare,
rewarding virtue and punishing wrong, and who lived in El-o-win, the
spirit land beyond the setting sun. There was also the evil spirit
lurking always to do them harm. They believed that when one of their
number died if be had lived a life pleasing to The Great Spirit, he and
all of his possessions were taken to El-o-win to be among his fathers.
But in case the Indian had been bad and had lived in a manner
displeasing to The Great Spirit, he was sent back to earth to live
another life in the form of the grizzly bear. Thus we find them, even in
their earliest history, subscribing to religious beliefs amounting, when
our own are boiled down to principles, to practically the same
thing--the rewarding of right living--and the punishment of wrong.

Their dead were held in great reverence and at their annual mourning
feast, which was held in honor of the dead, great quantities of
blankets, beads, baskets of the very finest workmanship, and other goods
were burned as an offering to their departed relatives and friends. It
was their belief that these articles were received and made use of in
El-o-win. Many of the Indians kept themselves poor by yearly
contributing nearly everything they owned to these fires.

They believed, because of the hot and cold winds which swirl about them,
that some of the waterfalls of the Valley were favorite abodes of the
evil spirit, and that if they ventured too near they would be drawn into
the falls an killed. This superstition exists among them yet. The
whirlwinds were also believed to contain evil spirits.
