### THE LEGEND OF LOI-YA

Uncounted flowers have blossomed and faded, and unnumbered snows have
come and gone since Loi-ya, a beautiful maiden of the Ah-wah-nee-chees,
and her mother were gathering grass seeds in the Po-ho-no meadow beyond
the top of the Valley. They had filled their baskets and were returning
over the old trail leading down from Patill-ima (Glacier Point), to
their camp in the Valley, when Loi-ya, who was ahead of her mother,
stumbled over a rock in the trail and fell over the cliff and was never
seen again. Her mother was heartbroken and refused to come down again t
o the Valley, saying that she must wait there for her daughter to
return. But Loi-ya did not come and her mother waited and waited, and
while she waited she grew old and bowed with sorrow. After many long
years had passed and still the mother waited, The Great Spirit took pity
on her grief and turned her into granite. And there in the shadow

of Sentinel Rock she may still be seen today, awaiting the return of her
beloved Loi-ya.
