<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">BERRIES AND NUTS</H3>
<P>Many varieties of edible berries were to be found in the Valley. From the berries of the manzanita, which grow in abundance on the Valley floor, a cider was made. These berries were also dried for winter use, as were blackberries, raspberries, or thimbleberries, strawberries, which, though very small, are of unusually fine flavor, currants, and choke-cherries, which if eaten raw are everything that their name implies. Pine-nuts were also considered a delicacy and were gathered in large quantities for winter use.</P>
