# CHAPTER VI

## CREATION

IT WAS the belief of the Indian that in the beginning the Coyote-man
made the world. Then taking the Frog-man with him he set out on a raft
into the east. When they reached here the Coyote-man told the Frogman to
dive down and bring up some earth, which he did.

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

\[paragraph continues\] From the earth that the Frog-man brought up the
Coyote-man made the land. Then from the home of the Coyote-man and the
Frog-man came other people, the Lizzard-man, the Cougar-man, the
Fox-man, the Fish-man, the Star-woman, the Grizzly-bear-woman, and many
others. The Coyote-man was a witch doctor of great power, and after he
had made the land so that it was good, he decided to make a perfect
people to live on it. The Coyote-man wanted to make these people like
himself, but the Lizzard-man said that it would never do to make people
with paws like the Coyote-man as they would not have fingers with which
to take hold of things. This suggestion made the Coyote-man very angry
and he jumped at the Lizzard-man who ran and hid in the rocks. Then they
argued for a long time and the Coyote-man finally agreed that the people
should have a hand with five fingers like the Lizzard-man. They then
decided that as the world was dark and cold there must be light and
there must be fire. So the Little-white-footed-mouse was sent to a far
away land to steal the fire, which he succeeded in doing. While being
pursued by the Valley-people from whom he had stolen the fire the
Little-white-footed-mouse, afraid of being caught, hid the fire in the
buckeye and cedar trees. From there some of the fire shot up into the
sky and became the sun, so there was light and heat, but some of it
remained in the trees, and ever since the people have known that by
rubbing the sticks of the buckeye or cedar together, they could make
fire.

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

When the Coyote-man had the land all finished and was ready to make the
people, he went all over the land and at each place where he wished the
people to live, he stuck into the ground two sticks. At the same time he
gave the places a name. When he had the sticks all put out and the
places all named, he turned the sticks into men and women. The
Coyote-man then told the Lizzard-man and the others that they must all
turn into animals, which they all did. The Coyote-man became the coyote,
and because he had never quite forgiven the Lizzard-man for persuading
him to make the people with hands and five fingers, to this day he hunts
and kills the lizzard whenever he can find him. The Grizzly-bear-woman
became the grizzly bear and carried with her into her new state her
fondness for acorns. The Cougar man changed into the cougar and still
possesses the power to hunt and kill the deer just as he did before. The
Fox-man became the fox and his skill as a hunter is just as great as
before. The Frog-man became the frog and still retains his fondness for
jumping into the water. The Lizzard-man became the lizzard and to this
day still has the habit of running and hiding in, the rocks. The
Star-woman, because of her fondness for the bright abalone shells, was
changed into the stars. The Fish-man became a fish and still makes his
home in the water. And so they all became the animals and birds and
flowers that are around us even yet.

When the people that the Coyote-man had made woke up and looked upon the
world they found it good. They

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

learned by watching the animals what articles were good to eat. From the
grizzly bear they learned that the acorn was food. From the crane they
learned to catch and eat the fish. The cougar taught them that the meat
of the deer, the elk, and the antelope was to be eaten. They gained
wisdom from experience, by observing how the animals and birds and bugs
lived. They multiplied and grew strong and built villages, even as the
ants. They were happy and worshipped The Great Spirit who had given them
life, and the sun which kept them warm. And in time, out of the natural
conditions surrounding them, and the accumulated wisdom of the ages,
they slowly evolved a system of habits and customs, certain methods of
collecting and preparing food, certain religious beliefs, and certain
ideas of government.

All of the people who lived in the region of what is now known as the
Yosemite Valley, were more or less related by blood or intermarriage,
and their customs, religious beliefs, and characteristics were more or
less curiously intermingled as a result thereof. What is said here will
be generally understood to apply to all of them, although there were of
course, differences, due, in most cases, to environment. In fact, as is
true in the case of all the Indian tribes, their mode of living, their
food supply, and even their habits and customs, were the outcome of the
natural conditions surrounding them such as climate, available food
supply and so on. From now on my story deals only with that tribe of
Indians who lived in the Yosemite Valley, and who later came to be known
as the Yo-sem-i-tes.
