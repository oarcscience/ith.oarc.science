### BRIDAL VEIL FALL

On the right the eye is drawn, as by a magnet, to Bridal Veil Fall,
pouring over and down the mighty cliff from its elevated canyon bed six
hundred and twenty feet above, to be torn and dashed into silvery spray
on the rocks below. Famed in song and story the world over, this fall
furnishes a scenic spectacle of such intrinsic beauty the eye never
wearies of gazing upon it. The gracefully waving sheets of gauzy spray
glimmering in the sunlight, the ever-changing rainbow hued clouds of
mist that chase each other in such graceful abandon from bottom to top
of the slender column; the ethereal and spirit-like quality of the whole
inspires a feeling of admiration and awe almost amounting to reverence.
