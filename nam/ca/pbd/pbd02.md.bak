# POMO BEAR DOCTORS

###### BY

## S. A. BARRETT

### INTRODUCTION

One of the most concrete and persistent convictions of the Indians of a
large part of California is the belief in the existence of persons of
magic power able to turn themselves into grizzly bears. Such shamans are
called "bear doctors" by the English-speaking Indians and their American
neighbors. The belief is obviously a locally colored variant of the
widespread were-wolf superstition, which is not yet entirely foreign to
the emotional life of civilized peoples. The California Indians had
worked out their form of this concept very definitely. Thus Dr. Kroeber
says: <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

A special class of shamans found to a greater or less extent among
probably all the Central tribes, though they are wanting both in the
Northwest and the South, are the so-called bear doctors, shamans who
have received power from grizzly bears, often by being taken into the
abode of these animals—which appear there in human form,—and who after
their return to mankind possess many of the qualities of the grizzly
bear, especially his apparent invulnerability to fatal attack. The bear
shamans can not only assume the form of bears, as they do in order to
inflict vengeance on their enemies, but it is believed that they can be
killed an indefinite number of times when in this form and each time
return to life. In some regions, as among the Pomo and Yuki, the bear
shaman was not thought as elsewhere to actually become a bear, but to
remain a man who clothed himself in the skin of a bear to his complete
disguisement, and by his malevolence, rapidity, fierceness, and
resistance to wounds to be capable of inflicting greater injury than a
true bear. Whether any bear shamans actually attempted to disguise
themselves in this way to accomplish their ends is doubtful. It is
certain that all the members of some tribes believed it to be in their
power.

Pomo beliefs differ rather fundamentally from those here summarized. In
the first place, the Pomo appear to know nothing of the magician
acquiring his power from the bears themselves. Since they ascribe no
guardian spirit to him, he is scarcely a shaman in the strict sense of
the word. The current term "doctor," misleading as it may seem at first
sight, may therefore be conveniently retained as free from the erroneous
connotation that "shaman" would involve.

In the second place, the power of the doctor was thought to reside
wholly in his bearskin suit, or parts thereof, and apparently was
considered the result of an elaborate ceremony performed in its
manufacture and subsequent donning. This distinctly ritualistic side of
the bear doctor's practices removes him still more clearly from the
class of the true shaman.

Thirdly, there is a detailed Pomo tradition of the origin of bear
doctors. This story is cast in the mold of a myth; in fact, its initial
portions may be taken from the current mythology of the tribe. Other
parts are, however, remarkably unmythical and matter of fact. The
resultant whole is therefore rather incongruous, and, in the form
recorded, may have been somewhat influenced by the speculations of an
individual. But the events which it describes agree so closely with the
beliefs which the Pomo at large entertain concerning the practices of
recent bear doctors that the question of the extent of the prevalence of
the myth among the group is of less importance than the insight which
the tale affords into the Pomo mind. Its many specific references make
it a suitable introduction to the presentation of the other data
secured.

These peculiarities render a comparison of Pomo bear-doctor beliefs with
those of other Californian groups desirable, but the published data from
elsewhere are unfortunately too fragmentary to make such a study
profitable at present. It has only seemed feasible to append some
comparisons with Yuki and Miwok beliefs.

It may be added that the statements which constitute the body of this
paper are the statements of native informants cited as representative of
their convictions, and not as the opinions of the author. The degree to
which the reputed practices of bear doctors were actually practiced is
far from clear, as Dr. Kroeber has stated. Whether, however, they rest
mainly, partly, or not at all on reality, they furnish interesting
psychological material.
