### COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BEAR DOCTORS

Informants state that the various bear doctors all over the country knew
each other. <span id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17) Two or more of them
often met by chance at some spring or other secluded spot in the
mountains, and at such times discussed their activities. They might tell
each other where they expected to be next month, or what mountain they
would use as a hiding place and base of operations next year.

Each bear doctor acted independently and knew no restrictions of any
sort so far as his fellows were concerned, nor had he or his relatives
any immunity from the attacks of other bear doctors, for one bear doctor
might become enraged at another and cause his death or that of some of
his relatives.

The only persons who were immune from these attacks were the captain of
the village and his immediate family. He knew all the, bear doctors and
received a share of their spoils in consideration for his friendly
protection.

Any bear doctor or person who knew all the secrets of bear doctoring
usually took his relatives, or, at any rate, certain of them, to this
hiding place and showed them enough of his secrets so that they would
lose their fear of bear doctors and not be frightened when they heard of
the death of some one through an attack by bears. Such partially
initiated persons always mourned the loss of the victim as did the rest
of the people, but were not, in reality, afraid of the bear doctors.

ascertained, they formed no organized society, and never met as a body.
