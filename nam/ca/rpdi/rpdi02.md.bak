### INTRODUCTION.

The people known as Diegueño, called by themselves Kawakipai <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) or southern people, <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) occupy the extreme southern part of
California. The region which they inhabit coincides approximately with
the boundaries of San Diego county. Linguistically they are divided into
at least two dialectic groups. One dialect is spoken at the villages or
rancherias of Mesa Grande, Santa Ysabel, Capitan Grande, Los Conejos,
Sycuan, and Inyaxa. These villages are located on reservations in the
northern part of the county. The people now residing at Campo,
Manzanita, La Laguna, Cuayapipe, and La Posta reservations, in the
southern part of the county, speak a slightly different dialect. During
the Spanish occupation of California, the people speaking these dialects
were associated in a general way with Mission San Diego. Hence both
divisions acquired the designation "Diegueño." The southern dialect is
spoken also by the Indians of Yuman family in Lower California
immediately across the Mexican border. This latter people may be
considered ethnographically identical with the people occupying the
southern group of reservations mentioned above. The extent of the
territory in the peninsula of Lower California in which this dialect is
spoken has

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

not been determined. The Diegueño, together with these neighboring
people of Lower California, are part of the great Yuman linguistic stock
to which the Yuma, Mohave, Maricopa, Walapai, Havasupai, Yevepai,
Cocopa, and the Cochimi and other practically unknown tribes of the
greater half of Lower California also belong.

In culture, the Diegueño show a marked similarity to their neighbors,
the Luiseño on the north, and the Cahuilla on the northeast. In
basket-making these people use almost exclusively the coiled weave. The
basket designs of the Diegueño are rather simpler than those of the
Luiseño and Cahuilla, and run largely to the horizontal band type. Like
their neighbors they manufacture fairly good pottery of a brittle,
porous variety. In place of the large conical burden-basket usual in
California, the Diegueño use a large burden-net with a packstrap to go
across the forehead. Twines made of milkweed, mescal or maguey, and
nettle fibres, are employed by them in the manufacture of a large
variety of textile objects, such as bags, ceremonial dresses, and the
carrying nets just mentioned. From maguey fibre they make excellent
sandals, of a type not found in California outside of this southern
region. The Diegueño, as well as the Luiseño and Cahuilla, build houses
of tule or California bulrush, which are fairly weather-proof and
permanent. Although big game is naturally scarce in their habitat, they
make a powerful bow of willow, its length and size compensating for the
lack of sinew reinforcement. Altogether, in the matter of material
culture, the Diegueño seem fully equal to the other people of the State.
Alone, among all the tribes of the State, they together with their
neighbors the Luiseño, Cahuilla, and Mohave, have achieved the
manufacture of pottery and the use of cloth-like textiles.

In religious matters the Diegueño seem to stand almost alone. They have
little in common, for instance, with the Mohave, who are their nearest
blood-kin in California. Certain of their external ceremonies they share
with the Luiseño, their neighbors on the north. The religious systems of
the two peoples are not, however, by any means the same. The Luiseño
have several rites which are not performed at all by the Diegueño. In
regard

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

to many details, furthermore, even where ceremonies are somewhat
similar, the Diegueño occupy an independent position. <span
id="fr_2"></span>[2a](#fn_2.md) In general religious outlook, as in
mythology, the two peoples are totally dissimilar.

Most of the rites which the Diegueño have in common with the Luiseño
belong to a definite cultus. This cultus is what has been described
among the Luiseño as the "Chungichnish worship." Among the Diegueño it
is known as awik or Western system. As described elsewhere in the
present paper, and in another paper of this series by a different
author, <span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#fn_3.md) this cultus centers around an
initiatory rite, which consists in drinking ceremonially a decoction of
toloache or jimsonweed, *Datura meteloides*. <span
id="fr_4"></span>[3a](#fn_4.md) In studying the religious practices of the
Diegueño a distinction is therefore always to be kept in mind between
the rites which belong on the one hand to the cultus and on the other to
the ordinary ceremonies, since the latter exhibit a totally different
animus, and have no definite relation either to the cultus or to each
other.

This cultus seems for several reasons to be a late development among the
Diegueño. They possess, in the first place, many ceremonies which are
supposed by them to be older than the cultus. A tradition exists that
this cultus was first acquired by the mainland peoples only three or
four generations ago, from the islands off the coast of southern
California, particularly from Santa Catalina and San Clemente. This is
very likely the origin of the term awik, "from the west," applied to the
ceremonies to-day by the Diegueño. Among the Luiseño and northern
Diegueño exist supplementary traditions concerning the spread of this
system of rites. The Luiseño say that they taught the practices to the
Diegueño, and the Diegueño that they learned

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

the practices from the Luiseño. This evidence is of a traditionary
nature only. In the southern Diegueño region, however, the cultus began
to be celebrated only within the memory of men now living. <span
id="fr_5"></span>[4](#fn_5.md) The same might be said of the remote
Cahuilla villages. The writer found old men at both places who
remembered when the practices were first introduced from the north. The
rituals themselves offer internal evidence of a late adoption by the
Diegueño. Of seventy-four songs concerned with these ceremonies obtained
by the writer, sixty are in a language said to be Luiseño. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[4a](#fn_6.md) The religious myths of the Diegueño never
mention this cult, or any of the practices connected with it. <span
id="fr_7"></span>[5](#fn_7.md) This fact would by itself be almost enough
to indicate that this jimsonweed or "awik" cultus is not primarily
Diegueño.

We may conclude therefore that there are two component factors in the
external religion of the Diegueño, as we find it today. They have
certain practices, in the first place, concerning the historical origin
of which we have no evidence of any kind. As far as our present purpose
is concerned, these may be considered inherently Diegueño. They employ
in the second place a large series of practices which, whatever their
original source, seem to have come to them through the agency of the
Luiseño.

As soon as we leave the matter of general outline, we find among the
Diegueño, even in the matter of "awik" practices, evidences of a
religious outlook totally different from that of the Luiseño. The
Luiseño, for instance, believe in a superhuman being,
Chungichnish, <span id="fr_8"></span>[6](#fn_8.md) practically a divinity.
He sends certain

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

animals, like the rattlesnake, bear, panther, or wolf, to punish
ceremonial offenses or omissions. <span id="fr_9"></span>[7](#fn_9.md) The
Diegueño, while they believe that certain misfortunes, among them
snake-bites, follow when these identical ceremonies are neglected, look
on the whole matter as being impersonal. They have a definite feeling
that certain aches in the bones are connected with the non-observance of
the awik ceremonies. These aches are called awik wutim or "sickness from
the West." The only way to prevent the experience of these evils,
including snake-bites, is to hold the ritualistic dances. So clear is
the association of the two ideas among the Diegueño, that when several
people have been bitten by rattlesnakes within a short period, the
leader, kwaipai, of the ceremonies is regarded as responsible because he
does not order the ceremonies oftener. While confident of the expected
effect, however, the Diegueño can give no definite explanation of the
cause. There is not the slightest evidence that they believe in a
personal god, who sends the punishments.

The Diegueño do conceive, however, that certain extra-human powers or
beings exist. These powers are associated with striking natural
phenomena. The electric fire-ball or "ball lightning," Chaup, is one
such supernatural being. He is thought to have lived once on earth in
the form of a man. Diegueño mythology is largely made up of stories
about his marvellous acts. He takes in part the place of a "culture
hero," since his actions frequently left permanent effects on the world
and on mankind. <span id="fr_10"></span>[8](#fn_10.md) It was he who struck
all the animals and plants in the world with a stick, leaving marks of
all sorts on them. <span id="fr_11"></span>[9](#fn_11.md) That is the way
the red

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

wattle came on the roadrunner's cheek, for instance, and the stripe on
the coyote's back. Many of the ceremonies performed by this people are
also founded on supposed actions of this hero. This is particularly true
of a mourning ceremony, known as the Keruk, southern dialect
Wukeruk, <span id="fr_12"></span>[10](#fn_12.md) in which the people dance
holding images. Many such incidents make him out clearly as a
"Transformer." Certain of the geographical features of the region
inhabited by the Diegueño are explained by reference to another mythical
being. A great ridge of white rock near Cuayapipe marks the trail made
by Ocean Monster, when he came across the land. <span
id="fr_13"></span>[11](#fn_13.md) The Diegueño know also of a "creator,"
Tochaipa (also called Chaipakomat), who first gave the world its form
and substance. Like the other great beings, however, Tochaipa is no
longer considered immanent in the world. There is a curious lack of
evidence that either he or any of the other of these powers are ever
approached through prayer or ceremonial practices.

The religious practices of the Diegueño will be found, rather curiously,
to spring from other sources than their belief in the existence of such
supernatural beings. Their important ceremonies are founded on one or
the other of two conceptions. One of these is that in early infancy, and
again at the period of adolescence, persons of both sexes enter into a
peculiar condition of receptivity. They are so firmly convinced of this,
that whatever the child or person does or undergoes in these two periods
is supposed by them to leave a permanent effect upon body and mind.
Numerous religious practices and prohibitions are therefore grouped
around these two periods. The inward purpose seems to be about equally
to prevent evil and to establish good. Young girls, to illustrate, were
carefully prevented during the period of budding womanhood from looking
at men. If they should look at men they would certainly smile, and so
wrinkle up their faces. If their faces were wrinkled during this
receptive or formative period, they would stay wrinkled and ugly through

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

after life. When boys were "initiated" at the age of puberty, their
heads were carefully freed of lice, under the conviction that if they
entered manhood without any parasites in their hair, they would never be
troubled in the future. Every newly born infant among the Diegueño was
in former times wrapped tightly in soft, nettle-fibre bandages, his
being tied down. This was done in order that he might grow up straight
and strong. If as an infant he were permitted to twist himself and throw
his limbs about, he would grow up to be ungainly, loose-jointed and
"rickety." Elaborate ceremonies, especially as regards the period of
adolescence in boys and girls, have been built up around such beliefs.

The second motive underlying the Diegueño ceremonies is the belief that
the souls of people have a continued existence after the death of the
body. This belief is at the bottom of the celebration of complicated
mourning rites. Their various beliefs concerning human "spirits" are
quite contradictory, but not for that reason any less typical perhaps of
primitive thought. The spirits of the dead are in the first place
thought to go "to the east." They say that if you go to a certain valley
over in the desert (they believe that this valley is the place where
mankind first came into existence) and put your ear to the ground, you
will hear grunting, footfalls, and the humming of old songs. These
sounds are made by spirits of the dead holding the ancient dances. The
spirit of each individual is on the other hand supposed to linger about
the localities and objects with which he was associated during life. For
this reason the Diegueño are afraid to handle or disturb ancient relics,
or to invade places where people have formerly lived. They use a certain
"medicine song" or charm if engaged with objects associated with dead
people, to preclude the possibility of confronting a spirit, or
"*diablo*" as they have been taught to call such beings. <span
id="fr_14"></span>[12](#fn_14.md)

The fear of the disembodied human soul seems to lie at the base of their
mourning ceremonies. The principal feature of the mourning practices is
the incineration of all a dead man's

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

clothes and belongings. A large fire is made at the proper time and
after appropriate ceremonies; and the deceased person's property, which
has been carefully segregated, is thrown on the fire. The purpose of the
incineration is to send the property "east" to its owner. While the
smoke and sparks of the burning material drift upward, the assembled
people sing:

<div align="center">

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The animus of the
practice seems to be a wish to send the property "to the east" in order
that the dead man may have no reason to return for it. <span
id="fr_15"></span>[13](#fn_15.md) A ceremony of similar import was
performed over each dead person, to free his spirit from all desire to
linger about the corpse. The old men gather about the body, and press it
time and again with their hands in unison. The motion is performed in
time to a chant:

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> At the end of this
song, the entire company motion upward with their hands into the air,
expelling the breath strongly. The song, as well as the gesture and the
"blowing" action, is repeated three times. Then the entire company stamp
one foot with a deep grunting sound. This sound was uniformly heard by
the present writer as "mwau," <span id="fr_17"></span>[15](#fn_17.md) and
occurs very often in nearly all Diegueño ceremonies. Following that the
entire company quickly expel the breath three times, motioning upward on
each occasion. It is thought that after this ceremony the body can be
safely handled and prepared for the mortuary rites.

Though disease is often explained in primitive thought as a "possession"
by spirits, <span id="fr_18"></span>[16](#fn_18.md) it is worth while to
note that the Diegueño differ from many primitive peoples in this
regard. They

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

conceive rather that the symptoms of disease are caused by certain
actual deleterious substances in the body. It is the business of
"doctors" or medicine men to remove these substances. "Sucking" is one
method employed. The doctor before beginning operations conceals some
small object, such as a seed or a wad of hair, in his mouth. He then
sucks the part of the patient affected, and produces this foreign matter
as having been sucked directly from the seat of pain or disease. The
Diegueño believe that such material objects can be caused to enter any
person's body through a practice which partakes something of the nature
of sympathetic magic. This practice was particularly effective if a lock
of the victim's hair, or something which had been intimately associated
with him, could be obtained. For this reason the Diegueño carefully
destroy all of their hair when it is cut off as a mark of mourning.

Certain of their practices nevertheless reflect vaguely a belief that
disease may be charmed away. When a man for example was taken ill, they
stretched him out on the ground and gathered around him. Then they
motioned upward three times with the hands, expelling the breath each
time. They then danced around him from left to right, stepping sideways
and singing:

At the conclusion of this song, they sat about the patient in a circle.
The oldest woman present, taking a small olla or pottery cup provided
for the purpose, urinated in it. The patient was then sprinkled <span
id="fr_19"></span>[17](#fn_19.md) with an eagle feather, the company
chanting:

<div align="center">

</div>

The writer was told by one informant that the people at Mesa Grande were
not accustomed to dancing as a cure for disease, but instead, blew
tobacco-smoke over the sufferer. Dancing, according to this man, was
practiced only by the people who lived in the south, "near the Mohave."

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

The religious rites of the Diegueño do not to any great extent center in
definite localities. Almost all may be executed in any convenient spot.
One reason for this may be that the Diegueño country does not present
many striking landmarks around which religious beliefs might center.
Every village has a circular dance ground, kept always in readiness,
where the dances take place. This is sprinkled and packed down hard to
keep dust from rising. In former times these dance-circles, hīma´k, were
surrounded with a wall of brush. This was placed upright in the ground
and, being held in place by large rocks, served to keep the wind away.
This brush enclosure seems to correspond roughly with the Luiseño
wamkish or ceremonial enclosure. <span id="fr_21"></span>[19](#fn_21.md) It
is not considered sacred, however, as the Luiseño wamkish is said to
have been, nor is it guarded with any secrecy. <span
id="fr_22"></span>[20](#fn_22.md) Among the Diegueño the ceremonial objects
were kept in a house called kwusitcnyawa. <span
id="fr_23"></span>[21](#fn_23.md) None but the men concerned in the
ceremonies ever entered this house.

Like many primitive people the Diegueño ascribe great importance to
religious dances. They always dance to the accompaniment of songs. These
songs are set off in a number of series, each one appropriate to a
particular ceremony. Such songs are always composed of words and have a
definite meaning. They usually describe the manner of dancing or mention
some fact connected with the performance of the ceremony. Thus:

<div align="center">

|                                                  |                                                                                               |

</div>

In at least one case, a ceremony known as the Eagle Dance, <span
id="fr_26"></span>[24](#fn_26.md) the songs seem to outline a myth or
story. In this usage the

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Diegueño resemble
the Mohave, among whom the songs regularly tell a story. <span
id="fr_27"></span>[25](#fn_27.md) Each song among the Diegueño consists
usually of two or three words, though the number is occasionally as high
as seven or eight. These words are usually repeated over and over again.
Sometimes the words are distorted in the singing until the meaning
becomes somewhat obscure.

The air of the song covers usually only a slight range, though a singer
will sometimes introduce variety by inserting a short passage in the
octave of the regular pitch. On the whole, their vocal music is not
devoid of melody. The singing is usually done by a whole company, one
person leading and often beating an accompaniment on a rattle of
turtleshell, axnal. Instrumental music outside of the sound of this
rattle is practically unknown at the present time. There is in the
Diegueño language a word for "flute," the object described being a plain
wooden tube with four stops, of the type common in California. The
writer has never seen an actual specimen of this instrument among the
Diegueño. The whistle, tcaxhwiw, was also formerly known, but neither it
nor the flute seem to have had any ceremonial significance. The rhombus
or bull-roarer was used by the Diegueño until recent years. It consists
of a smooth, narrow piece of greasewood about three feet long, fastened
end on to a short twisted rope of milkweed fibre. When swung rapidly
around the head of the performer it gives out a deep booming or roaring
sound. This instrument was formerly sounded three times as the signal
for an assembly for ceremonial purposes.

The religious dancing of the Diegueño does not exhibit much variety of
movement. It consists, except in one or two cases, in marching around a
central fire. The manner of marching or moving varies, however, for
different occasions. In the mourning ceremonies for example, the
movement is clockwise in single file. The dancers march face to the
front with a sort of twisting movement. <span
id="fr_28"></span>[26](#fn_28.md) In the girls’ puberty ceremony, the women
who dance hold hands in a circle, while each individual moves sideways

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

in a contra-clockwise direction. In a ceremony known as the Fire dance,
men and women join together and hold hands in a circle. Then the entire
circle rotates first in a clockwise and then in a contra-clockwise
direction. The individual members alternately run forward and side-step.
The only dance which appears in a measure complicated is the so-called
"War dance" which is danced by initiates into the awik cultus. The step
consists of a jump forward, made with the feet together, followed by a
short step with each foot. The general movement of the dance alternates
between circling about in contra-clockwise direction, stamping the feet
without moving in either direction, and jumping backwards in line. The
changes from one manner of dancing to another are instantaneous and
always executed in perfect unison. The dance is accompanied throughout
by grunting and gesticulation and when in full swing exhibits no little
animation. The most picturesque dance among the Diegueño is known as the
whirligig, tapakwirp. <span id="fr_29"></span>[27](#fn_29.md) It is danced
in the daytime while the great Mourning Ceremony, Keruk, southern
dialect Wukeruk, is in progress. The single performer in this dance,
attired in a ceremonial dress of eagle feathers, yipexai, moves rapidly
in a clockwise direction around the periphery of a circle, at the same
time whirling from left to right. The Diegueño have several other
dances, but all of them are of the simple marching type.

Both men and women, as just indicated, have a share in the religious
dances of the Diegueño. In some ceremonies both sexes take an active
part, as in the early part of the Fire dance for instance. The
adolescence ceremonies for girls are the peculiar prerogative of the
matrons of each village. Women, however, and all those who have not
drunk the kusī, are excluded from the corresponding ceremony for boys.
Frequently, however, the sex which does not take active part in a
ceremony sings the songs which accompany it. The men, for example, sing
during the progress of the girls’ ceremony, while the women dance. The
women on the other hand sing the songs of the men's "War

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

dance." There is no indication that women ever take active part in those
ceremonies which are supposed to concern magic powers. The final part of
the Fire dance, in which the performers affect to dance on the hot
coals, is danced by men alone. It is certain that women never became
"doctors" or magicians. The mother of Chaup is said in the myths to be
"just like a man, because she knew everything." <span
id="fr_30"></span>[28](#fn_30.md)

The Diegueño people have of course for some generations been under the
Christianizing influence of the Roman Catholic Church. The teachings of
Christianity have not, however, wholly eradicated their ancient
religion. A good deal of importance is still attached, particularly by
the old people, to the native observances. Many of these however have in
actual practice fallen into disuse. At the present time only a few
dances are regularly or normally practiced. The decadent observances
have however been discontinued only within the past twenty-five years.
Clear accounts of them are therefore in most cases obtainable. It seems
almost certain that the main outline at least of their ceremonial usages
remains intact to the present day.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[272:1](rpdi02.htm#fr_0.md) Phonetically the
Diegueño language is rather simple. The consonants b, g, h, k, l, m, n,
p, r, s, t, are pronounced nearly as in English. The sounds represented
by the English d, f, seem to be absent from the language. x in the
present paper stands for the sound of German ch. Ordinary l represents a
sonant l in which the tip of the tongue rests against the teeth. Small
capital <span class="sc">l</span> stands for a sound corresponding
closely to Welsh l, namely, a surd l. This sound is rather forcible in
Diegueño. Of unfamiliar sounds, the following are present: a surd r,
written as <span class="sc">r</span>; a trilled r, made with the tip of
the tongue close to the front of the palate, written <span
class="it">r</span>; and a bilabial v, written <span
class="it">v</span>. Following the established usage, the sound of sh in
shall is written as c; and correspondingly, the sound of ch in church (=
tsh) as tc. A sound resembling the sh sound in shall, but made with the
tip of the tongue further to the rear, is written c. Y stands always for
a glide, never for a vowel sound. In Luiseño words <span
class="sc">g</span> represents a velar spirant g or velar r.

The vowels are: a as in father, ē as a in fate, e as e in met, ī as ee
in meet, i as in pin, ō as in so, o as a in fall, <span
class="it">o</span> as u in cup, ū as in rule, u as in put, ü as in the
German über. The diphthongs are written oi, ai, and au. Oi represents
the sound of oi in boil, ai of ai in aisle, au of au in the German word
aus or ow in how.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[274:3a](rpdi02.htm#fr_4.md) For a religious use of
this drug among the Hualapai see John G. Bourke, "On the Border with
Crook," p. 165, 1892. The White Mountain Apache also use it (A.
Hrdlicka, Bur. Am. Ethn. Bull. 34, p. 25, 1908), mixing it with their
mescal for its intoxicating effect. So far as known, its employment is
characteristic of this southwestern area.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[275:4](rpdi02.htm#fr_5.md) DuBois, op. cit. 74.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[275:4a](rpdi02.htm#fr_6.md) This is probably an
incorrect statement so far as the Luiseño dialect is specifically
concerned, but is true if Luiseño is understood to mean any Shoshonean
language. Most of the Luiseño toloache cult songs are said by themselves
to be in the Gabrielino language of the north. See in this connection
footnote 55. The fifty Ho<span class="sc">r</span><span
class="sc">l</span>oi songs transcribed below contain the sound l only
once or twice, but r abundantly. In Luiseño r is rare, but l very
frequent. In the San Gabriel dialect Luiseño l regularly changes to r.
The original source of these songs is therefore scarcely doubtful. The
Diegueño however unquestionably received the songs from the Luiseño.

Diegueño see Journal of American Folk-Lore, XIV, 181, 1901; XVII, 217,

<span id="fn_10"></span>[276:8](rpdi02.htm#fr_10.md) Journ. Am. Folk-Lore,
XIX, 163, 1906: "When the little boy (Chaup) pulled his uncle's body out
of the ground, they cried and talked together. His uncle said, 'You
ought not to have done this. . When you put me back, (do not) let a
breath of wind arise from the place where I am buried'. The little boy
tried to do as he was directed . . . but in spite of all his trouble, a
breath of air puffed up from the grave; and this is the cause of all the
sickness in the world."

<span id="fn_11"></span>[276:9](rpdi02.htm#fr_11.md) *Ibid*., 161: "When he
came to his grandmother's house, he found it full of people of all
sorts, such as are now all the animals and plants and everything that
lives in the world. . . . The boy took his spear and stood in front of
the door and began hitting all these people with his spear. The
roadrunner was hit as he ran by and escaped, and the red may still be
seen on the side of his head where it was grazed by the spear. The
mock-orange came rolling out and it was hit many times by the spear. You
can still see the marks in white lines upon it."

<span id="fn_12"></span>[277:10](rpdi02.htm#fr_12.md) *Ibid*., 153: "So the
old woman took the shape into her hands and danced with it. (Song of the
Image Dance) This was the first time they made a dance for the dead. . .
. This is the reason they make the dance of the Images, wukaruk."

<span id="fn_13"></span>[277:11](rpdi02.htm#fr_13.md) See the Creation Myth
given below.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[278:12](rpdi02.htm#fr_14.md) DuBois, op. cit., p.
124, record 1093: "Two brothers were going along when one was bitten by
a rattlesnake and died of the bite. The other was afraid of his spirit.
It was following him and terrifying him."

<span id="fn_15"></span>[279:13](rpdi02.htm#fr_15.md) This seems to be the
fear of a dead man's return common among primitive peoples.

California, Department of Anthropology, phonograph record

<span id="fn_17"></span>[279:15](rpdi02.htm#fr_17.md) This is the action
described by Miss DuBois among the Luiseño as "a breathing groaning
invocation". Dr. A. L. Kroeber heard the same as "wiau." Op. cit., p.
182. No meaning for it has ever been discovered.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[279:16](rpdi02.htm#fr_18.md) This belief is
reflected, of course, in the New Testament; and was accepted until
modern times by the Christian church.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[280:17](rpdi02.htm#fr_19.md) The juice of the
jimsonweed or toloache was also used in this way.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[280:18](rpdi02.htm#fr_20.md) The purpose may have
been to impart the old woman's tenacity of life to the sick person. A
similar idea perhaps is that found in Poland, where a barren woman wears
the dress of some neighbor who has a large family.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[281:19](rpdi02.htm#fr_21.md) See Boscana, quoted

<span id="fn_25"></span>[281:23](rpdi02.htm#fr_25.md) A song of the same
ceremony, describing the position of the girls who undergo it. See

<span id="fn_28"></span>[282:26](rpdi02.htm#fr_28.md) The women formerly
wore in this dance skirts or short petticoats made of strips of elder
bark (paxa<span class="sc">l</span>). This movement is intended to make
these skirts swish back and forth.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[283:27](rpdi02.htm#fr_29.md) This is the dance
described variously by Miss DuBois, A. L. Kroeber, and P. S. Sparkman as
the Morahash, Tatahuila, and Dance with the Eagle Feather Skirt (present
series, VIII, 101, 183).
