*Religious Practices of the Diegueño Indians*, by T.T. Waterman,
\[1910\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### DIEGUEÑO BELIEFS CONCERNING ORIGIN.

As already suggested in the discussion of the Keruk ceremony, the
Diegueño explain the origin of certain of their religious practices in
the myths which concern a wonderful being called Chaup, to be identified
in all probability with the physical phenomenon of ball-lightning. This
myth has been contributed to the *Journal of American Folk-Lore* in
complete form by Miss Constance Goddard DuBois, under the titles of "The
Story of Chaup" and the "Story of Cuyahomarr." <span
id="fr_148"></span>[132](#fn_146.md) It must be noted in passing that this
Chaup, <span id="fr_149"></span>[133](#fn_147.md) or Tcaup in the
orthography of the present paper, is in many respects the culture hero
of the Diegueño. From his activity, according to the myths, date many of
the phenomena which taken together compose the world as we latter-day
peoples know it. For instance, the plants and animals used to be people
until Chaup or his relatives imposed on them their present appearance.
Cricket, <span id="fr_150"></span>[134](#fn_148.md) Jackrabbit, <span
id="fr_151"></span>[135](#fn_149.md) and Coyote <span
id="fr_152"></span>[136](#fn_150.md) are mentioned specifically in one
myth.

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Animals had no
names, so he named them. <span id="fr_153"></span>[137](#fn_151.md) They
had no distinctive markings (for instance the red wattle of Roadrunner,
the stripes on Mock-Orange, and the dark shading on Coyote) until Chaup
marked them. <span id="fr_154"></span>[138](#fn_152.md) These mythological
"heroes", Chaup and his relatives, first brought storms <span
id="fr_155"></span>[139](#fn_153.md) and disease <span
id="fr_156"></span>[140](#fn_154.md) into the world. They acted generally
speaking as models or prototypes for the customs and ceremonies of
succeeding generations. Sinyohauch tells her sons, for instance: <span
id="fr_157"></span>[141](#fn_155) "Do not quarrel (on this journey.md). The
people who come after will do the same as you (do)". This copying by the
people of an action performed by Chaup <span
id="fr_158"></span>[142](#fn_156.md) was the origin of the great Image or
Keruk mourning ceremony. Such then, in the Diegueño conception, is the
origin of the more striking features of animate nature and the usages
obtaining among human beings.

Certain elements in their culture, however, are supposed to have arisen
in another manner. The narrative concerning the second source seems by
the native informants to be felt as an inherent part of a certain
definite myth of "Creation" or Origin of the Mundus. We have two
independent ideas, then, among the Diegueño, with reference to this
general topic of origins. These are embodied in two types of myth. One
type, the "Chaup" story, tells among other things of the modification of
an already existing world, by "Chaup." The other type tells of the
origin of the mundus itself, and is a real Creation story. <span
id="fr_159"></span>[143](#fn_157.md)

The fact of Creation is mentioned and described in several places in the
literature now extant <span id="fr_160"></span>[144](#fn_158.md) concerning
the Mission Indian area and cultures. The Diegueño account for numerous

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

reasons must be considered as a distinct and independent narrative, not
related to the stories told by the neighboring Mission peoples. <span
id="fr_161"></span>[145](#fn_159.md) The present writer obtained a rather
complete outline of this Diegueño myth from an old man at Campo <span
id="fr_162"></span>[146](#fn_160.md) calling himself a Kamiyai. <span
id="fr_163"></span>[147](#fn_161.md) For several reasons this story is
interesting in the present connection. In the first place, and most
important of all, it is a fair sample of the primitive sacred story, as
found among the Diegueño. In the second place, it outlines as briefly as
could be accomplished by any other method the beliefs of the people in
question concerning the organization of the mundus. This among any
primitive people must be considered a definitely religious topic.
Finally, it helps to throw a certain illumination, from an independent
view-point, on the broader subject of Diegueño mythology, a subject
which is more or less germane to our present purpose. For these reasons
it seems proper to quote it in full, as obtained from the Diegueño
informant.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[336:133](rpdi24.htm#fr_149.md) Perhaps better
"Chaups," in the plural, since his remarkable attributes are in the
myths possessed also by his father, his uncle, and his grandmother
Sinyaxau or First Woman. Sinyaxau is the "Sinyohauch" of Miss DuBois’
narratives.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[337:143](rpdi24.htm#fr_159.md) It is impossible
to say definitely whether the two accounts of Origin are mutually
complementary, or whether they spring from vague and rather inconsistent
beliefs on the part of the Diegueño. As they stand in translation they
are certainly contradictory, but this may be only on the surface.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[337:144](rpdi24.htm#fr_160.md) For the various
Mission Indian myths on the subject, consult: Boscana, 241-257;
Constance Goddard DuBois, Journ. Am. Folk-Lore, XVII, 185, 1904; XIX,
52, 1906; XIV, 181, 1901; XXI, 236, 1908; also *ibid*., 234, a Mesa
Grande song of Creation, and *ibid*., 229, Kachawharr, a song series
from Jacumba, about Tuchaipa and Yokomatis; Congr. Intern. des

<span id="fn_159"></span>[338:145](rpdi24.htm#fr_161.md) For a full
treatment of this theme see the paper by the present writer in Am.
Anthr., n.s. XI, 41-55, 1909.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[338:146](rpdi24.htm#fr_162.md) This may perhaps
be the informant mentioned by Miss DuBois (Journ. Am. Folk-Lore, XIX,
162, 1906), from whom she obtained indirectly her "Yuma" creation story.
(See *ibid*., XXI, 236, 1908.)

<span id="fn_161"></span>[338:147](rpdi24.htm#fr_163.md) The Mohave
designate as Kamia a tribe living on the desert between the Yuma and the
Diegueño. That these people were closely related to the Diegueño of the
Missions, is shown by the fact that the Mohave name for the latter is
Kamia axwe, foreign or hostile Kamia.
