### TOBACCO.

While the Diegueño do not seem to attach much ceremonial importance to
plants, there is a definite religious feeling associated with tobacco.
The shape of the Diegueño stone pipe ([pl. 21, fig.
4](rpdi27.htm#img_pl21).md) indicates that tobacco was used by them
primarily in a ceremonial way. This pipe was not adapted for ordinary
smoking, since it is a short, thick cylinder in outline. In smoking it
has to be held in a perpendicular position, with the head tipped back
and the face turned upward. Tobacco smoke was blown on a man in

case of sickness. Tobacco smoke was also blown three times into the air
to prevent disease and misfortune when ill-omened events occurred, for
instance the cawing of a crow or the cry of a coyote. The religious use
of tobacco seems to be older than the awik or jimsonweed cultus, since
it occurs in Diegueño mythology. For instance: <span

the best of it,' said the boy. But he had some tobacco in a piece of
cane which he took from his ear and smoked, and blew the smoke at the
bear and put him to sleep so that he passed on. . . . The bear woke up
and said . . . 'He has more power than I.'" As just noted, tobacco is
still used ceremonially in the Ho<span class="sc">r</span><span
class="sc">l</span>oi dance, though its exact significance in native
thought could not be ascertained.
