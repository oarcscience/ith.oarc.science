*Religious Practices of the Diegueño Indians*, by T.T. Waterman,
\[1910\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CONCLUSION.

We may, in conclusion, carry away several definite facts concerning the
religion of the Diegueño people. One such fact is, that a certain part
of their religious practices are, so far as externals are concerned,
common also to the Luiseño and Cahuilla. An equally rich and much older
part of this worship is thoroughly and inherently Diegueño. As a basis
for at least this older part of their ceremonial, they have a rich and
varied, though not a voluminous mythology. We are entitled to a vehement
suspicion that the songs invariably used as the accompaniment of their
dances, bear a definite reference to this mythology. In fact only the
somewhat advanced decadence of their religious practices, and the
unfortunate fact that their language has never been exhaustively
studied, prevent the final establishment of this fact. In this one trait
alone they somewhat resemble their kindred, the Mohave. In mythology,
finally, they offer a sharp contrast to their Shoshonean neighbors, the
Luiseño and Cahuilla. The real affiliation of the Diegueño religion is,
like that of their mythology, probably to be sought among their kindred,
the other southwest peoples of Yuman stock.
