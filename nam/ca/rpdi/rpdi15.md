### THE IMAGE-BURNING.

When several members of a family have died within a short period, it is
customary to hold a ceremony called Image Burning or Keruk, southern
dialect Wukeruk. The corresponding ceremony

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

among the Luiseño is called Tochinish or Tauchanish. <span
id="fr_94"></span>[87a](#fn_94.md) Images representing each of the deceased
are made out of matting. These are stuffed with grass to give them a
lifelike appearance, and are dressed in all sorts of finery. Eyes, nose,
ears, and teeth are represented with bits of haliotis shell. The gum of
the greasewood is used for glue. Drops of this substance are also used
to make the pupils of the eyes. Human hair is put on the heads of the
images. These images, together with considerable property, are burned
amid elaborate rites. The whole forms a long and complicated ceremony.

Mention of this ceremony is made several times in the mythology of the
Diegueño. <span id="fr_95"></span>[88](#fn_95.md) Its origin is described
in the Creation myth which follows in this paper. It is believed by the
Diegueño to be the first ceremony ever performed. The author of the
account of the equivalent Luiseño ceremony says correctly that the
original source of the ceremony must remain a matter of speculation.

Though in the account given of the Luiseño ceremony no mention is made
of time, it seems likely that the rite itself consumes only two or three
days. The Diegueño ceremony, however, requires six days. For the latter
a small ceremonial house is built. This house, keruk, is absent from the
Luiseño ceremony. It seems, therefore, that the Diegueño have a fuller
form of the rite. Since, in addition, the ceremony is mentioned in
Diegueño mythology, while it is nowhere mentioned in Luiseño mythology
as so far printed, it at least seems likely that the ceremony was first
celebrated by the Diegueño and acquired from them by the Luiseño.

As always, the family giving the ceremony entertains all the visitors.
It was formerly a matter of pride to furnish not only an abundance of
food, but also to provide delicacies. For this reason a quantity of
pine-nuts, axiw, choke-cherries, akwai, and mesquite beans, ana<span
class="sc">l</span>, was gathered, and sometimes brought from a
distance. The images are made in some private place by the relatives of
the deceased persons. On the spot chosen

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

for the ceremony the small ceremonial house called keruk is erected. It
is in shape half a hemisphere facing the east. <span
id="fr_96"></span>[89](#fn_96.md) When all is in readiness the people
assemble and pass one night in wailing. In the morning they have
something to eat, and go to sleep. The relatives of the dead fast as
much as they can and carefully refrain, moreover, from touching any of
the festival supplies.

The next night a large fire is built near the keruk. The faces of the
images are then painted. Those which represent women are painted red
with scorched mescal syrup. Those which represent men are painted black
with graphite, with the addition of a white stripe down the nose and
chin. Amid great wailing the images are then picked up and carried to
the fire. The relatives join in the procession, but do not carry the
images. They continually wail. The following song is sung as they march.

<td data-valign="top" width="327"><p><span class="small">weeping we-arrive<br />
weeping we-come</span></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

When they reach the fire the people march around it from left to right.
They advance first one foot and then the other with the twisting motion
of the body already mentioned. The sound of the elderbark skirts worn by
the women at the time is supposed to be represented by the following
song:

<div align="center">

<table data-border="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />

... Pleiades (he)-comes-forth<br />
up-in-sky (he)-finishes</span></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

A long series of songs follows, and the dancing continues all night. So
the time passes for six days, with eating and sleeping in the daytime,
and dancing at night. Several times every night the relatives of the
deceased persons pile baskets and clothing on the fire and burn them.
Small baskets are also thrown in the air. These the visitors gather up
and keep for themselves. This is always accompanied by wailing on the
part of the family giving the ceremony. On the seventh night, after
dancing till sunrise, they put the images inside of the keruk. Then they
put in a great quantity of property, clothing, baskets, beads, and
household goods. Finally the remaining space is

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

filled with dry brush and the whole set on fire. While the smoke and
sparks shoot upward in the early morning sunlight, they sing the
following song:

<div align="center">

<table data-border="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

wa katomi aminy awa</span></p></td>
<td data-valign="top" width="327"><p><span class="small">is-going essence to-your home<br />
is-going essence to-your home</span></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The significance of this song as showing the existence of a belief in a
future life has already been discussed. The singers were thoroughly
questioned concerning this belief, but no further particulars were
brought out. No distinction seems to be made in this future state
between "good" and "bad" people, nor between those who observe the
ceremonies and those who do not. Concerning the general purpose of the
ceremony, the usual explanation was that offered for the Clothes
Burning—that people did not wish to see any reminders of the dead left
about, because it made them feel bad. This of course does not explain
the custom of burning new and valuable property which has no association
with the dead. On a second visit to the region the writer was informed
that the ceremony was to make the dead contented, "so they would not
come back." After this ceremony the dead are never mentioned, and signs
of grief are discontinued.
