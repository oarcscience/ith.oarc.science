### CONCLUSION OF THE GIRLS’ CEREMONY.

With such matters the time elapsed day by day until the girls could no
longer endure the inaction of remaining in the pit. As each girl
surrendered and came out, she took off her garland and her hair
bracelets and left them in the pit to be burned with the brush when the
whole ceremony was completed. <span id="fr_52"></span>[49](#fn_52.md) One
informant at Los Conejos spoke of the girls leaving the pit at the end
of about a week. According to him, they were then put in a row face
downward while four grown women walked on their backs. This was to make
them straight. While one woman walked, the others stood at the girls’
feet, covering their faces with their hands. For the first month after
leaving the pit the faces of these girls were painted black with
straw-charcoal. Through the second month they were painted red with
vertical stripes, axwitc, of black. Throughout the third month the
pattern was a series of horizontal stripes of black, xicamkwi<span
class="it">r</span>, on a red background. For at least six months after
first entering the pit they were supposed to abstain from meat and salt,
and to eat very slowly. Otherwise they would be gluttonous in after
life. If they abstained, they would live long. At the end of this period
they were given a little meat, just a taste. As soon as they began to
eat meat their faces were no longer painted.

The corresponding ceremony among the southern Diegueño differed slightly
from that performed near Mesa Grande. Only two kinds of herbs seem to
have been put by the people of the south into the pit with the girls.
They were willow, ayau, and white sage, bi<span class="sc">l</span>tai.
Informants at Campo denied that they used the crescent-stone there. The
girls seem to have remained in the pit for a definite period of seven
days. In place of the headdress already described they wore a wreath of
yellow flowers, mi<span class="sc">l</span>tasiw. It is denied in the
southern region that the girls were given the tobacco-water to drink, as
was the case among the Luiseño and the northern Diegueño. <span

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

to have worn skirts of willow-bark, caiyula, fastened to a belt of
milkweed fibre. Mention is made at Campo of a daily bath taken by all
the girls during the progress of the ceremony. <span
id="fr_54"></span>[51](#fn_54.md) The Diegueño, whenever questioned, say
that the purpose of the ceremony is to make the girls live long.

In the corresponding Luiseño ceremony <span
id="fr_55"></span>[52](#fn_55.md) the girls are said to have had a footrace
and to have painted the rocks in the neighborhood of their village.
Rock-paintings exist in the Diegueño country, but are said to have been
made by the boys in connection with another ceremony, the description of
which is as follows:

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_52"></span>[292:49](rpdi06.htm#fr_52.md) According to an
informant at Mesa Grande, they were sunk or "buried" in a large spring
near the location of the present rancheria at that place.

94, 176; Am. Anthr., n.s. VIII, 32, 1906.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[293:51](rpdi06.htm#fr_54.md) In Luiseño, the word
"to menstruate the first time," *aci*, is a specific use of the general
word which means "to bathe."
