### THE WHIRLING DANCE, TAPAKWIRP.

Before the dancer appeared, on the occasions when the dance was
witnessed, one of the old men made an energetic speech, saying that the
ceremony was ancient, and must be done exactly according to usage. The
dancer remained out of sight in a brush house or "ramada" until this
lecture was completed. When all was in readiness and the crowd waiting,
an assistant who was with the dancer raised a long cry, sounding like
"kūūūwa<sup>n</sup>h!" All the old men around the himak or dance-circle
grunted and stamped with the right foot. The assistant then repeated his
cry, and all stamped again. On a third repetition of the cry, all
grunted and stamped three times. Then the assistant, exclaiming
"a-ha-ha-ha a-ha-ha-ha," ran out of the house, and entering the
dance-ground from the north side, <span id="fr_86"></span>[81](#fn_86)
ran half way around its circumference. Then he halted and dropped on one
knee, facing the sun. He carried a stick in each hand. These he held up
toward the sun as if to protect himself from a blow (pl. 27, fig. 1).
After a momentary pause

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

the dancer also appeared on a run, entered the dance-ground from the
north, encircled it once in a clockwise direction, and halted at the
point of entry. He also carried two short, smooth sticks ([pl. 26, fig.
3](rpdi27.htm#img_pl26)). When he halted he touched these two sticks to
the ground and leaned upon them ([pl. 27, fig. 2](rpdi27.htm#img_pl27)).
The costume as shown in this figure consisted of a skirt or kilt of long
eagle-feathers, yipexai, mounted on milkweed-fibre network. <span
id="fr_87"></span>[82](#fn_87) In connection with this was worn a
head-band of split owl-feathers, tsekwirp ([pl. 22, fig.
4](rpdi27.htm#img_pl22)), mounted on a circlet of mescal or other fibre.
His body was painted ([pl. 26, fig. 3](rpdi27.htm#img_pl26), [pl. 27,
fig. 3](rpdi27.htm#img_pl27)) in broad stripes of white paint. This is
made of powdered soapstone mixed with water. This costume seems to be
the ancient ceremonial dress of the Diegueño and their neighbors, the
Luiseño, since Boscana, writing in the early years of Spanish influence,
describes practically the same dress. <span
id="fr_88"></span>[82a](#fn_88)

An old man with a rattle took his stand close by the dancer, and the two
conversed in a very low tone. This was always done whenever the dance
was observed, though the words were in so low a tone that they could not
be distinguished. They are thought by the younger people to have
ceremonial significance, though the present writer was never able to
discover precisely what is said at the time.

After a moment the old man began to shake his rattle and sing. The
dancer trotted around the circle once or twice, and then began to whirl
as he went. The song was as follows:

<div align="center">

<table data-border="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td data-valign="top" width="327"><p><span class="small">niyaukam penowo<br />
pawaiyom temetpon<br />
nipa<span class="sc">l</span>on</span></p></td>
<td data-valign="top" width="327"><p><span class="small">I-handle ... <span id="fr_89"></span><a href="#fn_89">83</a><br />
feather-skirt sun<br />
my-rattle</span></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

The dancer signalled for faster music by rapidly striking together the
two sticks he carried. After some time he struck these sticks together
once, and as the song ended he made a short leap, landing on both feet.
Then to this accompaniment of a deep grunt from the old men looking on,
he bent his knees slightly, pointing the stick in his right hand toward
the ground.

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Then he trotted
silently around the circle to its northern edge, and leaning over rested
on his two sticks.

The next song was as follows:

<div align="center">

<table data-border="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td data-valign="top" width="327"><p><span class="small">neyonga nitceyo<br />
pa-a-awaiyom</span></p></td>
<td data-valign="top" width="327"><p><span class="small">my-head my-...<br />
eagle-feather-skirt</span></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

The dancer trotted around the circle as at first, but soon began to skip
instead. Finally he began to turn as he skipped, hopping or skipping on
one foot between every half-turn. At times he changed his step in the
midst of a song from the plain turn to the skipping turn. He also paused
for an instant at frequent intervals to squat three times ([pl. 27, fig.
4](rpdi27.htm#img_pl27)), facing in a different direction each time.
Three or four songs always completed the dance, and the performer then
ran back whence he came.

Other Tatahuila or Tapakwirp songs are the following. They are sung with
no apparent regard to order.
