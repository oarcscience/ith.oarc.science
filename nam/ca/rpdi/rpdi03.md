*Religious Practices of the Diegueño Indians*, by T.T. Waterman,
\[1910\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CUSTOMS CONCERNING BIRTH AND ADOLESCENCE.

The expectant mother among the Diegueño refrains as far as possible from
meat and salt. This is held to make childbirth less dangerous. At birth
the navel string of the infant is cut with a flint knife, hakwuca. A
poultice or small mat of pounded white willow bark, mya<span
class="sc">l</span>, southern dialect meya<span class="sc">l</span>, is
then heated at the fire and placed on the infant's abdomen. Among the
northern Diegueño a small flat stone perforated at one side, mi<span
class="sc">l</span>aputapa, was used in place of the willow bark. This
was thought, by warming the stomach, to cause the child's digestion to
be good for life. So far as the present writer could ascertain, no
customs attach to the umbilical cord itself. Wrappings or swaddling
clothes of nettle fibre, aho<span class="sc">r</span><span
class="sc">l</span>, <span id="fr_31"></span>[29](#fn_31.md) were put on
the child immediately. As soon as practicable thereafter the infant was
bound on a straight "cradle-board" made of willow twigs. This binding

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

on the cradle-board is thought to make his back straight and strong. The
people say nowadays that all the old men, who are as a rule remarkably
hardy, show the advantage of this practice. The younger generation, who
are laid in beds and baby-buggies and other soft places, grow up
round-shouldered, and are not sturdy like the older generation.

The customs and restrictions attending adolescence are made the occasion
of long and somewhat complicated ceremonies. Boys were put through the
rather violent kusī or jimsonweed initiation into manhood. <span
id="fr_32"></span>[29a](#fn_32.md) At this time they were taught the
practices which are supposed to prove the possession of magic power. The
proper religious knowledge was taught them through the medium of a great
"painting" made on the ground in seeds and colored earths. The girls
escaped the administration of the jimsonweed drug, and were not shown
any painting. <span id="fr_33"></span>[30](#fn_33.md) Their ceremony had
quite a different purpose, and was apparently concerned primarily with
the prospect of motherhood. The difference between the two ceremonies
might be summed up by saying that the boys’ ceremony was primarily an
initiation into a ceremonial cultus, while the girls’ ceremony referred
to their physiological well-being in their future life.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[284:29](rpdi03.htm#fr_31.md) Compare above, p.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[285:29a](rpdi03.htm#fr_32.md) Cf. [p.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[285:30](rpdi03.htm#fr_33.md) It must be observed
that this contradicts the account given of this ceremony by Miss DuBois,
op. cit., p. 96. The boys’ ceremony is one of the awik or imported
series, while the girls’ ceremony is thought by the present writer to be
older and original with the Diegueño themselves.
