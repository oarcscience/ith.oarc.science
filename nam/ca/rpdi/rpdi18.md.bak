### THE FIRE CEREMONY.

This ceremony never occurs by itself, but always follows some other
dance. When observed by the writer it occurred late at night after a
Ho<span class="sc">r</span><span class="sc">l</span>oi or War dance. It
also occurs as part of the kusī or toloache ceremony and the Clothes
Burning. After the close of whatever rite preceded it, some one of the
old men always made a very emphatic speech, saying that the Fire dance
had descended from long before, and was very ancient. <span

Men and women then gathered about the fire in a large circle. The man in
the company who usually leads the dances then began to sound his rattle.
The people moved about the fire in a "sidestep" to the accompaniment of
this rattling, without singing. Two circles were gradually formed, one
of them inside of the

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

other, moving in opposite directions. At frequent signals from the
leader the direction of the movement was reversed. Shouts of laughter
greeted the sudden change. After some time the effort seemed to become
tiresome to the younger people, who one by one dropped out. This left
only the old men and women in the dance. The movement now became more
sedate. The dancers gradually formed a single line, which circled about
the fire from right to left. All the dancers moved forward with a
twisting movement, which as already explained, is intended to swish back
and forth the skirts of elderbark formerly worn by the women.

Suddenly all raised their arms, holding them out from their sides for
the space of three or four steps. Then they faced inward, toward the
fire, joining hands all around. While they held hands they stepped
sideways to the left. After several steps in this position, they loosed
their hands and struck downwards with their arms. Then they stamped
three times with the right foot, accompanying each stamp with a grunt.
This was followed by a ceremonial rest.

The dance was resumed to the accompaniment of a song:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">apampe peno<span class="it">v</span>i  
hai-i yo-ona</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> At the end of the
second line the entire company squatted suddenly down and rose together.
The character of the dancing step was also changed. Each dancer jumped
sideways to the left twice, and followed this by a short step to the
left. After some time the men suddenly squatted or crouched three times,
pointing at the fire first with the left hand, then with the right, and
then with the left again. This action was followed by a rest. The same
step was shortly resumed, to a different chant, of which the following
were the words:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">waiyoti waiyoti <span
id="fr_132"></span>[118](#fn_130.md)  
neyonga meteya  
nekiwe nitceyo  
tcama a<span class="it">v</span>i nitceyo</span>

</div>

Throughout the above song the men stamped violently. At each step they
swung their fists "underhand" at the fire. Mean-

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

while they moved about in a circle, of which the center was the fire, in
short jumps, each one followed by a single step. At the end of the
singing, the leader shook his rattle, and all grunted and struck
downward toward the ground. Then he rattled again, and all motioned away
into the air and expelled the breath.

When the dancing began again, the step consisted of two jumps followed
by a short step. The women had by this time all dropped out, and only
about a dozen old men were actually taking part in the rite. The song
was as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">watani watani  
waiyai mani</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> At the close the
leader rattled two loud strokes and then a long roll, calling as he did
so, "mwau." All stamped their feet once and grunted. He repeated the
rattling and the exclamation, and all expelled the breath and motioned
into the air.

The words of the next song were:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">pako weknam  
pako dikile (incomplete)</span>

</div>

When the fifth song began, the men ran sideways around the fire quite
rapidly. The singing was also very fast and loud. The rattling took on
the character of a steady, beating cadence. The entire performance
assumed an excited appearance. The words of the song were:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">a<span class="sc">g</span>o<span
class="it">r</span>owi take  
tcaposon take  
a<span class="sc">g</span>o<span class="it">r</span>owi</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The old men gave a
loud yell in the midst of the song, and dropping on their haunches close
to the fire, began pushing the blazing wood in a pile with their feet.
Leaping up after a moment they continued to dance, but soon returned to
the fire again. They danced in on the coals as much as they could, and
each man before he was driven back by the heat would throw himself on
his haunches, kick at the fire, and surreptitiously pile in a little
dirt with his hands. In this way the fire was gradually extinguished.
The women throughout kept up a shrill and rapid chant. The effect of the
whole was rather good. The leaping figures of the dancers were outlined
in inky black against the

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

ruddy light of the bonfire, and their swirling feather headplumes lent
an air of wildness. Even the whites who looked on were visibly impressed
toward the close, while the young Indians seemed completely awed. When
nothing was left but blackened coals and a dim pile of glowing embers,
the dancers left the circle and the ceremony was over.

This ceremony was formerly accompanied by the exhibition of many magic
tricks. A quantity of liquid, said to be a decoction of willow bark, was
drunk by the performers before coming to the dance. At the proper time
they took slender curved wands twelve or fourteen inches long, called
"swallowing-sticks," kotat, <span id="fr_133"></span>[119](#fn_131.md) and
inserted almost the whole length in their throats. The violent vomiting
which ensued was held to make the fire mysteriously "cool." It is likely
that in the old days when no shoes were worn, the toughness of the soles
of the dancers' feet enabled them to dance actually on the coals without
much discomfort. Even at the present day their method of dancing would
severely burn a bare-footed white man.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[325:117a](rpdi18.htm#fr_131.md) The occurrence of
these emphatic ceremonial speeches or addresses is, as will be observed,
a feature of all Diegueño rites.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[326:118](rpdi18.htm#fr_132.md) The words of this
song, as of the preceding, have the appearance of being Luiseño.
