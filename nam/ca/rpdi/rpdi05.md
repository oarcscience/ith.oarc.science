### BAD SONGS.

Part of each day, usually the afternoon, is given up to the singing of
curious songs which are called by the people "bad" songs. The intent of
these songs is to insult and revile the people of hostile villages. The
songs name over people in each village who have recently died. With the
Diegueño, as among many primitive races, the naming of a deceased
relative or friend is deadly injury. Some of these songs refer to other
unpleasant facts about people, or ridicule them in various ways. They
are sung by the men, while the women gather in two groups, one at the
head and one at the foot of the reclining girls, and dance. This dancing
is done by rising on the toes and dropping back on the heels in time to
the music. Their hands are at times held out in front, palm upwards,
with forearm stiff. At other times they hang loosely. The position is
shown in [pl. 26, fig. 1](rpdi27.htm#img_pl26.md). It was impossible, owing
to the long skirt worn when the photograph was taken, to determine
whether or not the toes are ever lifted from the ground.

Specimens of such songs are the following:

This song (used by the people of Mesa Grande) refers to a man of another
village whose daughter, son, wife, and mother-in-law

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

had all died within a short period. The village where he lived was said
to be near where San Dieguito is now.

A second song referring to the same people was used at Mesa Grande. The
people from San Dieguito once came unbidden to Mesa Grande to take part
in a festival, so the people there sing this song about them.

The following song is also sung at Mesa Grande, but the singer had
forgotten the circumstances to which it refers.

It was formerly the custom in singing certain of these songs to name
over all the places and landmarks between the village of the people
mentioned in the song and the home of the singer. Many of these
place-names are no longer used, however, and the songs are therefore in
part forgotten. The following fragments will illustrate the point.
