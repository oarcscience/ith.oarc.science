### COLORS AND DIRECTION.

Among the Diegueño exists a peculiar association of direction with
color. <span id="fr_142"></span>[126a](#fn_140.md) The two ideas appear
together frequently both in their myths and in their religious formulas
and rituals.

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> North is
associated with red, east with white, south with blue or green, these
colors not being distinguished by the Diegueño, and west with black.

One of the songs accompanying the Eagle dance given above is:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The white eagle puts his nest on cliffs.  
The eagle from the west puts his nest on sycamore along the edge of the
creeks.</span>

</div>

The eagle from the *west* is in the song contrasted with a "white"
eagle. The western eagle seems therefore to occur to the native mind as
black. The association of west with black is carried out by the
statement of the old men, that when the dancers witch a white eagle to
death in the Eagle-dance, as described above, "they send him east. When
they kill a black eagle they send him west."

In the myth of Chaup, <span id="fr_143"></span>[127](#fn_141.md) there is
shown a corresponding feeling for color connected with north and south.
"The elder sister, who was a witch-doctor and knew everything, stood up
and held her hand to the north and brought down a red stone. ... Then
she held up her hands to the south and got a blue stone of the same
sort." Further on in this same story, <span
id="fr_144"></span>[128](#fn_142.md) the corresponding colors for east and
west are indicated. "The boys stood and held their hands to the east and
got some white clay and with it they painted their cheeks. Then they
held their hands to the west and got some black clay."

A complete color-system for the four cardinal points has already been
quoted in connection with the Clothes-burning ceremony. The account of
the original ceremony is as follows:

From the north he (the first man making the ceremony) brought a red
rock, from the east a gleaming white rock, from the south a green rock,
and from the west a black rock because the sun sets there. Then he said:
"My father and grandfather are dead, so now I sing."

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

Certain passages in Diegueño mythology seem to indicate that this system
is not always understood. In the Chaup story, for instance, the
following passage occurs: <span id="fr_145"></span>[129](#fn_143.md) "Then
she held up her hand to the sky and got a black sticky substance . . .
and then she reached out her hand toward the west and got some shining
stuff like quicksilver." This of course contradicts the statement
already made, that west is associated with black and east with "gleaming
white." The author of the quoted passage, however, elsewhere confuses
her Diegueño directions east and west. In her paper in the present
series <span id="fr_146"></span>[130](#fn_144.md) east is given as awik,
and west as nyak, the terms being reversed. The confusion of the color
association in the above passage may therefore have risen only in the
English translation, and not from any confusion in the mind of the
native narrator.

The colors are however to a certain extent confused by the Diegueño
themselves. The present writer for instance obtained the following
sentence from an old man at Campo named Tciwa<span class="sc">l</span>:
"He reached his hand to the north (he was a wonderful medicine man) and
got a blue flint." North of course ought properly to be "red." In this
case the contradiction came from an actual confusion in the informant's
mind. The writer's attention was attracted by the violation of the usual
color rule and the argument which followed precluded the possibility of
any misunderstanding of the narrator's words.

It must be said however that in all such violations of the rule which
have so far come to light in Diegueño mythology, the color in question
is always applied to the direction opposite to the proper one if any
mistake is made. North and south are always identified with one pair of
colors, east and west with another. The order within these pairs merely
is sometimes reversed. On the whole, in spite of occasional
discrepancies, the color-system outlined above may be considered well
established.
