### OTHER CEREMONIAL MATTERS.

A moon ceremony among the Luiseño is mentioned by Miss DuBois <span
id="fr_134"></span>[120](#fn_132) in the following words: " They sing
'Wy-ot, Wy-ot' nine times, then 'Ne-yonga (My head), ne-chaya,
tomave.' <span id="fr_135"></span>[121](#fn_133) The dances were to
please the moon and prevent his waning."

This seems to correspond to what is known as the "Sick Moon" ceremony
among the Diegueño. Information about this ceremony is not very
satisfactory, but the following particulars were at length obtained by
questioning several informants. The ceremony is held when the moon rises
in the daytime and looks small and pale. The people at this time went
out and bathed themselves and had footraces "to please the moon and make
him glad." At the same time the women danced, each one by herself, and
sang songs. Some of these songs are the following:

The belief was that "if they sang and made a noise and laughed down here
on earth, the moon would grow cheerful and get well and large again."
