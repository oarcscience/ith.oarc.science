### THE "WAR" DANCE.

The writer observed the Ho<span class="sc">r</span><span
class="sc">l</span>oi or "War dance" a number of times in the fall of
1907. It always occurred after nightfall. A large fire was kindled in
the evening on the northern side of the dance-circle and soon after
sundown a number of women seated themselves in a group near it. As fresh
wood was thrown on, the old men who expected to dance began taking off
their shoes. Each one put on either an owl-feather headband, tsekwirp,
([pl. 22, fig. 4](rpdi27.htm#img_pl22).md), or else tied a handkerchief
about his forehead. Those who had headplumes of split owl-feathers,
talo, ([pl. 22, fig. 1, 2, 3](rpdi27.htm#img_pl22).md),

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

thrust them upright in this headband. An old man then stood up and made
a short speech, very loud and emphatic. The other old men grunted three
times deep in their chests. The old man then said a few words, and the
others grunted once. The substance of the speech was said to be that the
dance had come down from their fathers, and that they were going to do
it as they had always done it. Then the leader of the dance, without his
rattle, took a position close in front of the women, and leaning over,
began to mutter the words of a War-dance song. The women listened in
silence. The old man varied his muttering by stamping with his right
foot and grunting. This continued until the occurrence of one of the
ceremonial rests. A second old man then joined the first, and the two
sang in a [guttural](errata.htm#5.md) whisper, at times clapping their
hands softly as if to urge the women on. After some time the women began
to sing, so faintly at first that the sound was barely audible. The
singing was interrupted by occasional pauses or rests. The leader seemed
to call for these by clapping his hands sharply once with a deep grunt.
During these pauses or rests the men left the dance-circle, but the
women remained seated, without movement. The leader gave the signal for
more dancing by entering the circle and beginning the words of the next
song.

After some time the singing grew more distinct. More of the men joined
in at every pause, and the grunting also grew louder and more labored.
The dancers marked time to the music by stamping with the right foot.
Soon they began to hitch themselves forward in little jumps after each
stamp. The singing grew rapidly louder and shriller. By the time the
seventh or eighth song was taken up the music was a full-toned chant, of
which the words were plainly audible. The dust by this time rose
steadily from the feet of the old men as they shuffled backwards and
forwards.

There seemed to be no rule governing the number of times the words of
each song were repeated. The men joined in certain parts of every song,
singing in a very jerky and energetic fashion. In fact, they exclaimed
rather than sang. When they were not singing, they grunted in unison in
time to the music.

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

During the eighth or ninth song, the men faced to the left, that is
toward the west, and began to dance in a large circle. The dancing step
consisted of two jumps, followed by a stride. After completing the
circle they always formed a stationary group in front of the women,
stamping hard and grunting. At places in every song during the latter
half of the Ho<span class="sc">r</span><span class="sc">l</span>oi
dance, marked by a sudden rise in the pitch of the music, the men all
raised and shook first their right hands and then their left, their
fists being closed. <span id="fr_120"></span>[109a](#fn_120.md) This was
done three times. The old man who led the singing always touched the
right side of his neck, in this gesture, with his left fist, fingers
out, after he had shaken his fist toward the west. No definite
information concerning the significance of the gesture was obtained. The
movement in a circle was explained as representing the movement of the
cultus eastward from the islands. "The dance came from the west, so we
dance from the west," is the way in which one informant put the
statement.

The close of each song was marked by a quick, explosive grunt on the
part of the men. This was always accompanied by striking the open hands
together once.

After the dance had been in progress several hours, the men just
previous to each pause formed in line and danced backward. In this
movement the hands were clasped together in front, the dancers assuming
a stooping posture. The singing and dancing always stopped at the time
of the ceremonial pause with surprising suddenness, the leaders breaking
into a satisfied chuckle as the final explosive word of the song found
them stricken motionless.

Several times in the course of this ceremony a man who seemed to have no
other duty raised a saucer full of tobacco in his two hands. As he did
so he pronounced "mwau" in what resembled a tone of surprise or
astonishment. The dancers always responded with an upward gesture and an
expulsion of the breath. This was repeated three times, the third
repetition consisting of two expulsions. Between times this man sat
motionless near the women. He was said to be called the "Tatahuila," in
Diegueño.

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

kaponai<span class="sc">l</span>. <span
id="fr_121"></span>[110](#fn_121.md) The tobacco thus held aloft was
afterwards smoked by the old men.

As the closing song of the Ho<span class="sc">r</span><span
class="sc">l</span>oi the Diegueño always sang the following:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">kaipo<span class="it">v</span>ipaima  
po<span class="it">v</span>item ya<span class="it">r</span>a  
ta<span class="it">v</span>oyaki nata<span class="it">v</span>o  
miita<span class="it">r</span>a</span>

</div>

This song, in contradistinction to those which immediately preceded it,
was sung very slowly and very softly. Each dancer removed his headplume
and held it in his hand. As the song progressed, they gradually shuffled
into a line before the women and stood facing them "Indian file."
Holding the plumes in their right hands, they made long vertical strokes
in time to the music. From one side the gesture gave the impression of
being directed at the women. At every third repetition of the song the
dancers waved their plumes skyward with an expulsion of the breath. At
the twelfth repetition the leader cried out "tea." The dancers in
response gave three quick expulsions of the breath, followed after an
instant by a fourth. The leader then cried: "Par<span
class="it">o</span>pum, par<span class="it">o</span>pum!" (throw it
away!) The dancers then repeated the last gesture.

During a Ho<span class="sc">r</span><span class="sc">l</span>oi dance
which took place at Mesa Grande in September, 1907, the following songs
were sung in the order given. They were said to be in the Luiseño
language, but are more probably in the related dialect of San Gabriel.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_120"></span>[322:109a](rpdi17.htm#fr_120.md) The hostility
suggested by this gesture, which occurs frequently, is said by some to
be the reason why the ceremony is called the "War" dance. The name may
however be derived from the whites.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[323:110](rpdi17.htm#fr_121.md) See above under
Boys' Adolescence Ceremony. "Tatahuila" is a very familiar term in the
mouths of both the Luiseño and Diegueño. It is said by both to be a
Spanish word. It suggests, however, the Luiseño root *taw-i*, to sit at
one side, *tatawi*, to sit customarily at one side, plus the noun-ending
*-la*. On the other hand the regular suffix denoting the action of a
verb is *-c*, and the accent should not leave the stem syllable, so that
the Luiseño form to be expected would be *tata´wic* rather than
*tatawī´la*, in Spanish orthography *tatahuila*. The tempting etymology
is therefore at least doubtful.
