### THE FEATHER CEREMONY.

A distinctive mortuary ceremony is performed after the death of each
toloache initiate. Among the Diegueño it is called "otcam", and seems to
coincide with the unish matakish ceremony of the Luiseño. <span
id="fr_84"></span>[79](#fn_84) It is said by the Diegueño to take place

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

on the afternoon preceding the Clothes-Burning ceremony just discussed.
Some time about the middle of the afternoon one of the old men swings
the bull-roarer, ai<span class="it">r</span>, three times. This is the
signal for the people to assemble. Some especially practiced man then
performs the Whirling dance. This corresponds to the Luiseño Morahash
dance, <span id="fr_85"></span>[80](#fn_85) called at the present time
the "Tatahuila." It includes a great deal of whirling, and a man who is
not used to it becomes dizzy and falls down. This dance has been
observed a number of times by the writer. It is also performed in
connection with another mourning ceremony known as the Eagle dance.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_84"></span>[307:79](rpdi12.htm#fr_84) DuBois, p. 92.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[308:80](rpdi12.htm#fr_85) *Ibid*., p. 185.
Etymologically, the word is compounded of the root *mor*, to whirl, plus
a connecting vowel *a* which indicates that the root is to be taken in a
passive or middle sense, plus a suffix *hash* which means "the doing
something for someone else." The Luiseño name implies, therefore, *the
whirling that is performed in behalf of someone else*. This is
particularly in harmony with what has been elsewhere written concerning
the Tatahuila.
