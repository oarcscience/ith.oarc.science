### THE THUNDER BIRD TOTEM POLE

This Totem Pole was the personal property of Charlie James (Yak-U-Las)
master carver and; story-teller of the Kwakiutl Indians who live along
the inlets adjacent to Alert Bay, British Columbia. The fourteen
different symbols on the pole represent the secret societies to which he
belonged—some were inherited, others he acquired through marriage or by
giving potlatches (feasts). Behind each one there is a legend of the
tribe's ancestors, the Myth People.

This talented Indian artist extended the arts of the tribes by his
design, some of which have been used to illustrate this book. The
originals were first painted on spruce boards and cottonwood veneer.
Eight of the former now hang on the wall of the Lipsett Memorial at
Hastings Park Exhibition Grounds and eight adorn the Vancouver City
Museum. A twelve foot Thunderbird totem pole and some others were carved
by Mr. James for the author of this work through the years of their
friendship.
