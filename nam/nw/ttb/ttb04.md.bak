### THE TRANSITION OF TOTEMISM

When the early explorers, Captain Cook and the Fur Trader, Captain John
Mears, sailed the seas of the Pacific Northwest, a great deal of their
time was spent on the West Coast of Vancouver Island at Nootka, then
known as "Friendly Cove," where the early ships of the Spanish Dons
chanced to touch.

The early adventurers observed that the aborigines practiced what they
thought to be a hitherto unknown religion, having many weird rituals and
ceremonies and requiring a grotesque regalia representing the
supernatural animals and birds. This religion has since been identified
as Totemism.

Totemism was created in the pre-historic age by the fathers of organized
society and improved as the mentality of the human race developed. When
ancient hunting had ceased, the tribes formed themselves into fishing
communes, out of which rose private property, social classes and slaves,
thereby creating the custom of barter. This first transition of mankind
[occurred](errata.htm#4.md) thousands of years ago in Europe, Asia and
Africa. The records of these first human movements are given in stone on
the Upper Nile and in the temples of India. It is hard to imagine in
these modern times, when civilization is supposed to be at a high peak,
that the Indians of the Northwest and other North American Indians, were
so belated. The transitions of the human race are slow, they have many
setbacks. Totemistic societies still function in many other parts of the
world, as among the native tribes of Australia, Korea, and even in
modern Japan.

The functions of the Totemism of the Indians of the Pacific Northwest
and, especially, the British Columbia, represent many aspects. The first
Totemic Symbol was supposed by the ancestors of these tribes to have
floated to their shores from some unknown source. On it were perched
three crows to guide it through the troubled waters of remote seas. The
Indians also believed that when their forefathers were first placed upon
the earth it was essential that they should marry their kith and kin,
but they later discovered that if they were to continue this practice
their race would decay. This was arrested by forbidding the members of
the same family to mate, being blood relations. From this sprung
totemism, functioning with its clans and their many septs. Among the
Haidas, the seat of the culture, there came into being the Sky People
and the Ocean People. From the Sky People came the Raven (Thunder Bird
among other tribes), and the Eagle. From these came the septs embracing
the Sun, Sky, Stars, the Moon and Birds and the Grandmother, the first
Creator. From the Ocean People sprang the creatures that live in the
water: Blackfish (Killer Whale), Codfish, Halibut, Salmon, Seal and Sea
Otter, as well as many supernatural animals that were supposed to live
beneath the sea. These latter are so grotesque that they seem to have
stepped out of the preglacial ages of the dinosaurs. Around these
symbols were created their culture and legends. They preserved them by
carving them on their implements of daily use,

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

also painting them in their interiors of their lodges, as they had not
arrived mentally at the point of devising a method of inscribing this
history on monuments or on the written page.

Prior to the time when the Indians came in contact with the Europeans,
there were no outside Totem Poles or elaborate carvings. These were only
achieved by the advent of iron tools, the culture therefore reached its
height between 1860 and 1900. Indian villages of British Columbia then
became veritable forests of totem poles, there being from ten to fifty
erected in each locality. After 1900 the culture slowly declined on
account of the Indian Act of the Dominion, which governs Indian affairs,
and which forbids Potlatch Gatherings. The Clergy also prevailed upon
the Indians saying: "There is only one true God." Hundreds of totems
were cut down and burned. Some of the tribesmen deplored the destruction
of these relics of art. Many of the grotesque and hideous monsters of
their imagination were saved by collectors and found their way to
museums throughout the world. At present there is not an Indian
settlement of the North Pacific Coast that can show much of its former
splendour. Due to the prohibition of Potlatches, which curtails their
rites and feasts, the Indian's secret orders are now the almost
forgotten glory of a changing race.

Of the aborigines of the Northwest there were only five tribes that
carved Totem Poles, these were in Southeast Alaska and British
[Columbia](errata.htm#5.md) and comprised the Haidas, Tsimshians, Bella
Coola, Kwakitutl and Nootka. There are various kinds of Totem Poles,
they can not all be treated fully in this book: Family poles, Tribal
Totems, and House Posts. The latter are used to support the heavy beams
in community or private houses. They are from ten to twelve feet in
height and composed of two or three objects such as Thunder Bird, Bear
and a Slave (Two examples are to be seen in Stanley Park, Vancouver) or
whatever was the owner's crest. Tribal Totem Poles are the mythological
history which would embrace forms of [genealogy](errata.htm#6.md), charms,
evil spirits, legends and witchcraft. This would also apply to family
Totems, which would also be inscribed with the individual's greatness
gained through potlatches or by heredity and which were generally
erected by the nephew of the deceased, the next in line of inheritance.

This passing of the inheritance to the nephew, may at first glance,
appear an injustice to his son, but when we take into consideration the
fact that primitive people simply do not recognize male parentage,
tracing all their [genealogies](errata.htm#7.md) through the female side,
it is not an unreasonable arrangement. Any man may not be able to swear
that his wife's son is his own, but he can certainly swear that his
sister's son is his nephew. Again, we must remember that the son may
have even better prospects as heir to his mother's brother.

The carving and erection of a totem pole was a very complicated and
expensive undertaking, the carving alone, in some cases, costing as much
as two thousand dollars and requiring months of labor. The carving of a
Totem Pole for the deceased was generally looked after by the brother,
in the interests of the nephew. The brother would

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

consult the relatives who would discuss the matter fully, giving him the
privilege of employing the carvers and selecting the cedar tree. This
wood endures the elements longer than any other native timber. The
neighboring tribes would then be invited to a potlatch which would last
from two to three weeks. Food would be supplied to the guests. A great
feast (gift feast) would take place accompanied by many dances and
ceremonies and a general jollification. Useful presents would be
distributed. In modern times it might be a blanket, a stove, a sewing
machine or money. To each of the invited guests such enormous amounts
would be given that the tribe or family would often be impoverished and
become public charges. Some of these potlatches have been known to cost
as much as $15,000.

The mythological art of the North Pacific Coast Indians is one of the
most grotesque and beautiful of any of the native tribes if the North
American Continent. The symmetrical lines and circles add tone
throughout. One wonders how the primitive mind was capable of finding so
many ways to add harmony and balance to each curve. Here and there was
added the ever-seeing eye, it was carved or painted on utensils or tools
or in the many different designs, for did not the eye have to see what
was to be accomplished? Some of the eyes, including the human eye, are
inserted in the body of the figure.

The Totem's symbols are never overlooked and are bound to excite the
interest of the most casual observer. The small wooden, and more
especially the slate Totem Poles, are also remarkable on account of the
fantastic overlapping methods applied to each symbol without destroying
its identity, but more often adding interest at some spot that at first
seems to portray no significance. A cunning twist in the carving makes
it perfect. Supernatural beings are always cut in such a way as to
expose the tips of their ears, signifying that they lived as people on
earth when it was in semi-darkness, before the light burst forth from
the heavens through the aid of the Young Raven.

The transition of the primitive aboriginal from a state, of cannibalism
and barbarism to the democracy of the white man has been such a severe
shock that they have lost a generation of activity. It is only of recent
years that they have become interested enough in themselves to carry on
the arts and crafts of their fathers. The older people have kept the
fires of memory burning by telling the deeds of the past to the younger
generation, thereby stimulating the desire to carve again, but this
time, up to the present, only to the extent of making small wooden totem
poles for strangers who visit their villages. Most of the totems
purchased are a mere confusion of carving, one object on top of another,
giving the totem no special significance. To obtain a story pole with
the story, would be almost impossible as it would be beneath the dignity
of a Chief to carve and sell his own coat-of-arms. Other Indians would
be ridiculed should they attempt to exploit the crest of another. The
only one who is allowed to exercise that privilege is the reputable
professional carver, retained to carve for the members of the tribe.
