### STORY OF THE MINK (BORN-TO-BE-IN-THE-SUN)

Tum-Tum had been digging for clams in the sand and catching baby crabs
in the pools of water left by the outgoing tide. He was tired and was
making his way to one of the whale canoes along the beach to lie down
and rest. A long shadow from a high mountain in the west which would
cool the afternoon air. Lying down on a bear-skin blanket he soon was on
his way to slumber land where his ancestors dwelt.

Tum-Tum then heard someone approaching singing a song to the rhythm of
their paddle.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"*Oh my paddle steer me to shore  
 As the times you have done before  
 I seek "Born-To-Be-In-The-Sun"  
 My boy, my boy, my only one*."

</div>

He peeped from the bow of the canoe and spied a woman as she stepped on
the beach and came toward where he was hiding. As she approached Tum-Tum
asked who she was, and where she came from.

"My name is Nice-to-look-at. I am from
Pleasant-places-in-the-ten-mountains. I am the mother of
Born-to-be-in-the-Sun.

"I know him, he is the mink. Come, I will show you. He is now waiting
for the frog-woman to come down off my grand-father's Thunder Bird Totem
Pole."

The pretty lady took his hand. As they walked along she told her story.

"One morning, while I was making a sea-otter blanket, the sun came and
shone on my back through a knot hole in my room. Shortly after the mink
was born, he grew up to be a man very quickly.

One day he came to me and said, "Mother, I want to marry the
frog-woman."

"But you won't like her croaking."

"That is just what I like."

"Go on," I said, so they were married, and then they left in a canoe for
the distant mountains far across the waters and did not come back."

Tum-Turn lead pretty lady to where the Totem Pole stood and there was
the mink talking to the frog-woman. His mother spoke gently to him. "My
boy Born-to-be-in-the-Sun". He smiled and rolled his eyes.

"Mother, my wife and I have been resting under the protection of the
Thunder Bird's spirit of goodwill. He will be glad to meet you."

At those words, Thunder Bird flew off from the top of the Totem Pole.
Flashing his eyes like lightning and flapping his wings, making thunder.
He circled the village and came back where the visitors were standing.
He took off his feather clothing and mask and became a man.

Thunder Bird then commanded all those on the Totem to arouse themselves,
come down to the ground, take off their masks and

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

meet Mink's mother. Some of the myth people took off their masks and
became human. Those who did not were Ho-hook. Zoon-a-qua and Raven.
Nice-to-look-at related her story again of the sun, and she had come to
seek him. But how to get to his house in the sky no one knew . Thunder
Bird said he could fly up there. Raven thought it best to wait for
sundown then the house would not be so high in the Heavens. Finally
Tum-Tum said, "Let us make bird arrows and shoot them at his house. If
it can be hit, we can shoot another and another into their hocks, then
we will have an arrow chain that will reach from earth to Skyland."

So they all got busy making arrows. Mink made a strong yew wood bow.
When all was ready, Tum-Tum took the bow and began shooting upward
making the chain like he said. Only a blunt one was left over.
Zoon-a-qua, the Sleepy one woke up and said, "I will shoot this one to
wake the sun," for a cloud had blotted out the house. Up and up it went
and was soon lost to sight. They all stood around in wonder, waiting to
see what would happen. The sun has many tricks. The arrow returned with
such swiftness that Zoon-a-qua could not dodge and it hit him on the
head leaving a big bump which amazed everyone and made them laugh.

Tum-Tum shook the arrow chain and it became a cedar rope, up which he
and Pretty Lady started to climb followed by the mink with the
Frog-Woman on his back. After climbing for a long time they finally came
to a big house. From its front a great stream of light poured forth over
all creation. Standing near the doorway was a tall strong man with a
broom in his hand bidding them welcome. This was all so strange the
Frog-Woman began croaking. The Sun invited them to come inside. He
inquired of Nice-to-look-at, "I've seen you before." The Mink spoke up
and said, "This is your wife and I am your child." To which he replied,
"I [remember](errata.htm#23.md) now. Could you loan me your feet? I have to
walk all the time, my feet get tired and if you don't keep sweeping your
aunts and grandmothers (the clouds) will come and then it will get dark
inside. And all Skyland as well, if Thunder Bird knows that he will
flash his lightning and roll his thunder to scare the people of the
village to spill their buckets of raindrops. You had better come in the
house, the rascal may be up to some mischief right now." The sun began
sweeping again.

When the Mink and his friends went inside they saw many
[wondrous](errata.htm#24.md) things. Everything was bright and spotlessly
clean. In the four corners stood strong men holding up the beams that
supported the roof. Large cedar crests carved with the Sun's crest were
piled on top of each other all around the sides of the house. These
excited the Mink's instinctive curiosity, so that he snooped around,
opening and closing the boxes. One was filled with sunrises, one had
sun-beams in it, another was full of rainbows, and one had sunsets. To
open the four boxes at one time would be disastrous but the Mink did not
know. Others held the Sun's masks, rattles, dishes carved of wood and
costumes for his dances. Boxes of food were stored everywhere. In the
center of the house there was a hole from which one could see the earth.
Below this was the well of life and death through which the souls from
the dead departed from the earth. Unborn souls went from here on the
journey

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

of life.

The Sun addressed the Mink again, "When are you going to lend me your
feet? My, it's getting foggy in here."

The Mink had no more than started to take them off when there was a
screeching noise like a thousand owls. The four strong men holding up
the roof became frightened as the whole house trembled with a skyquake.
There was a great confusion, the Thunder Bird was outside, lightning
flashed, thunder rolled—he was having fun.

The Sun's visitors slid from one end of the house to the other until
they all disappeared through the Well of Life and Death. They came
floating down, down and down to the earth, landing
[noiselessly](errata.htm#25.md) as a snowflake on a sandy beach, then
started to make up their Totem-Pole again with the Thunder Bird on top.

Tum-Tum woke at the call of his mother. "You naughty boy, here is where
you have been hiding. Get your blanket and come in the house out of the
rain."
