### Kutze-ce-te-ut, THE WOOD WORM

The Wood Worm legend is a very important incident to the tribes
affiliated with the Haidas of the Queen Charlotte Islands and the
Mainland of British Columbia.

A daughter of a Chief had entered her **maha-pil-pil** (period of
puberty) and was kept hidden behind a screen, not being allowed to come
in contact with any other member of the tribe other than her own family
for fear that she would make them lose their luck. Nor was she allowed
to go near the river for fear that she would gaze on the salmon and that
they would turn back, thus bringing hardship upon the tribe through
their not being able to secure the fish for food. It was also believed
that a girl at this stage of womanhood possessed great magical power.

One day, while putting wood on the fire, a stick **kulakula** (wood
worm) fell from the bark. She picked it up carefully and wrapped it in a
blanket. She took the worm to her sleeping place and offered it some
food but it would not eat. Then she offered it her breast. From then on
it grew very rapidly. She fondled her worm as if it was her own child,
keeping it secreted behind the food boxes. Her mother, noticing her
continual absences, came upon her fondling the worm which had grown as
big as a man.

The Chief was called to look and was greatly amazed as he had never seen
such a thing before. He held a consultation with the daughter's uncle.
Her uncle invited her to his house for a special dish of food, much to
her liking, and while she was eating he stole away to look at the wood
worm. That evening the people were called together and they were told of
the monster. They were told that the food and grease boxes were emptied
at such a rate that soon the tribe would be on the verge of starvation
and that it might give them some fatal disease. The following day the
girl was again asked to her uncle's house and when she was away the men
of the village took their long sharp fish spears and killed the object
of their fear. When the girl returned to her apartment she found the elf
dead. She cried bitterly, accusing the people of slaying her child. She
then sang songs about **Kutze-ce-te-ut** until she died of grief.

In commemoration of this event the descendants of this girl's family
display the figure of [**Kutze-ce-te-ut**](errata.htm#14.md) as the crest
of [their](errata.htm#15.md) ancestors. A totem pole with a carving of a
Wood Worm is difficult to secure. It is more often found engraved on the
native silver work.
