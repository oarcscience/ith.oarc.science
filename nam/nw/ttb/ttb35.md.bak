### Eh-Kolie, THE WHALE

From the twilight of tribal history the emblem of the whale has been
used by the Nootka Indians of Vancouver Island. This tribe were great
sea hunters and pursued the whale many miles from land in their Wolf
canoes.

The Nootkas believed that their universe lay on the back of a great
whale and at the bottom of the sea he dwelt in a community house. He who
is known as **Eah-toop**, the right whale, ruled over this Domain. In
his household were two beautiful young mermaid-like women whose names
were **Ohk-iss** and **Paytles** and who, at one time, were kidnapped by
the spirit of **Sin-Set** but were rescued from the Wolf house by
Tootooch, the Thunder Bird and returned by him to their home on the
ocean floor.

The Indians always rejoiced when a whale was cast up on the beach and,
if the Chief of the tribe was not present, there would be much fighting
and quarreling. Often knives would flash and cut. Some would want this
or that piece of whale meat or blubber. Traditionally, the whale
belonged to the Chief, who would divide it according to the rank of
individuals in the community after, of course, selecting the choicest
parts for his own household. The meat would be boiled, the oil pressed
out, and stored to be used later with fish and other foods.

A Haida legend tells of the following incident: The Raven was terribly
hungry and wanted a whale to eat. He killed one by waiting for the whale
to come up and blow and, when his blow hole was open, the raven flew
down his throat and picked at his heart until he died. The Raven forgot
that when a whale is dead the blow hole would close, and although he
made a lot of fuss and noise he could not escape. He was a prisoner
through his own folly.

The dead whale at last floated onto a beach near an Indian village. The
Indians seized the prize and began cutting it up. As they did so the
Raven flew out and disappeared behind the village. He then returned in
human guise while the Indians were still working away at the whale. Said
he to them: "You people are lucky today." They replied: "You think so?
Well, there is some queer luck here." "What is wrong?" asked Raven. They
then told him that when they first started to cut up the whale a bird
flew out. He appeared much surprised at this. He asked to be allowed to
help them finish and they hurried to fill their boxes with the meat and
blubber so as to get them out of reach of the in-coming tide. Raven
suggested that they should hold a meeting in the Chief's house and
divide the whale so that each should know just how lucky he was. When
they were away he assumed his bird-form again and, picking up all their
boxes of whale meat, he flew with them to a steep mountain, calling over
and over: "Kaw-kaw, some people never know their luck."
