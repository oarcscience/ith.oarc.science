This Totem Pole tells in Indian figures the story of Chief
**Sisa-Kaulas’** great ancestor **See-wid**. **See-wid** was a delicate
young man whose father was disappointed in him, thinking he was
incapable of carrying on the family honor. One day another Indian in the
same tribe, with more initiative than **See-wid**, saved the tribe from
a great disaster at the hands of their enemies, which made the young
man's father more than ever displeased with his delicate son. Shortly
after this **See-wid** was walking in the forest. He came to a pool of
clear water where he meditated over his inability to please his father
and lead the fortunes of his people. Suddenly there appeared in the
water a giant frog, who asked him: "Do you wish to come with me?"
**See-wid** answered that he would, and climbing on to the frog's back
the frog carried him down to the bottom of the pool, to the Spirit
world. There he forgot his troubles, for the spirit of the deep gave him
permission to use for his crests the sea- bear, sea-otter and the whale,
a permission greatly coveted by the Indians. **See-wid** was a long time
in returning to the land of the earth, and passed through many hardships
before he was able to resume his life among his own people, but when he
returned he was a strong man, and became one of the most powerful of the
Indian chiefs.

\(i\) The top figure **Kolus**, sister of the Thunder Bird, who is
always represented with folded wings. On **Kolus’** breast is seen
painted the crest of the Raven Clan, signifying that this bird was seen
by **See-wid** in his journey through the spirit world.

\(ii\) A noted chief, one of the ancestors of Sisa-aulaus, embracing his
baby son.

\(iii\) The chief in figure (ii) is resting his feet on the upturned
tail of a whale, **Ka-Kow-In**, upon whose back all creation rests. The
face carved on the figure of the whale is symbolical of the time when
the moon was stolen from the Creator.

\(iv\) The sea-otter, **To-sil-la-gut**, spirit of the deep, shown
eating a sea-egg.

\(v\) The sea-bear who, according to Indian belief, was both able to
live in the sea and enter the bowels of the earth.

\(vi\) A carved head with a wide open mouth. This is to signify the fate
of a rival of the chief, or any who dared to speak evil against the
chief. The head is that of the executed rival, exhibited as proof of the
chief's power and triumph.
