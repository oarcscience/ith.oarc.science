### INDIAN BASKETS

For ages there have been a great many Indian tribes living on the
sheltered inlets and along the rivers that reach far into the heart of
the mountain ranges of the Pacific Northwest. All tribes make their own
particular kind of baskets for their domestic needs. The use of clay was
unknown to them, although it could have been obtained in many
localities. Therefore, the Indians gathered and fabricated the materials
that were close at hand.

The tribes of the upper Fraser regions fashioned their baskets for daily
use from birch-bark and split willows. The Thompsons, who inhabit the
bench lands along the Fraser Canyon, made their baskets of cedar roots,
splitting them into ribbons of uniform size and winding them around
splints left over from the former process. Straight strips of the same
material are used for sewing, a bone needle being used for this purpose.

The basket is built up on the spiral principal. They were made in many
sizes and many shapes, to suit all needs, there were burden baskets,
water buckets, cooking pots, trays, and those for the storing of food
and clothing. A handy one was made for the purpose that could be laid
flat or carried on the back, or hung on the branch of a tree.

Cooking was done by putting water in the cooking pot and then adding hot
stones. A cover, made to fit, was put on and it was allowed to stand
until the food was cooked. Trays were used as plates, to fan the fire
and to dry berries on, by laying them in the sun. Many of the baskets
show very little wear after fifty years of use.

The handicraft of the Thompsons was in great demand among the other
Indian tribes and was traded and bartered for with buckskin hides,
[moccasins](errata.htm#8.md), and other useful commodities. There are no
other Indian tribes of North America who have the technique or wealth of
design of the Thompsons. One is amazed that straight lines can be
arranged in so many hundreds of ways to make geometrical figures. The
decorations are done with cat-tail flags and the bark of the wild
cherry, either dyed or in the natural color. Basket designs were
inherited. When a new one was created it belonged to the family and was
never copied by others.

In this generation the younger Thompsons are being torn between two
paths: the white man's civilization and their own. It is doubtful if
they will carry on their ancestral art. It is true that the baskets they
make at present are not so well done as those of earlier times, for the
soul of the weaver is not in her art, the object being compensation
only. Old Thompson baskets are very difficult to secure and are quite
valuable, having been made by the older women whose work is in great
demand by collectors. In Germany and other European countries, many
British Columbia Indian basket designs serve to decorate textiles and
other articles.

The Indians living close to salt water were also stone boilers but they
did not depend on baskets so much for their cooking. They

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

fashioned wooden boxes out of boards by an ingenious method and also
hollowed out pieces of alder and other hard woods to serve their needs.
Tree trunks, often ten feet in length, were used, in many cases for
feast bowls. These were [beautifully](errata.htm#9.md) carved with the
owner's crest and inlaid with coast abalone shells. The boxes were made
by grooving a board in three places on one side, then placing it in a
ground trench filled with hot rocks over which water was poured to
produce steam. A covering of cedar mats was used to confine the vapor.
When the board was thoroughly steamed, it was bent at the grooves to
right angles, thus forming a perfect square. The ends were fastened
together with wooden pegs. A grooved bottom was then pegged on, making
the box water-tight. Boxes of this kind were made for many purposes.
When an Indian speaks of his "box", he means an elaborately carved and
painted chest containing the regalia of the clan of which he is a
member. Some day it will probably be used to put his body in after the
toil of life is over.

The Indians who live on Vancouver Island, the surrounding islands and in
the neighboring State of Washington, make their baskets out of the same
materials as their ancestors. The grasses used are gathered from the
tide flats of the lagoons. They are dried and bleached in the sun and
seasoned by hanging them up in the rafters of their houses. The material
is then colored as desired with [aniline](errata.htm#10.md) dyes, whereas,
in former times, they made their own dyes from vegetables and mineral
substances.

Among the handiwork of the Nootka women it is very seldom that any two
baskets can be found exactly alike. There are so many hundreds of border
designs. These are attractive and, in every case, the lid matches the
body of the basket.

The grass is woven around bottles of all shapes and sizes, made into
shopping bags, mats and handy trinket baskets and other articles which
strike the Indian's fancy. These articles are of intriguing beauty,
decorated in brilliant colors with pictographs from their folk tales,
some of which are told and illustrated in these pages. This basket work
is eagerly sought by souvenir hunters who wish to carry away with them,
as a memento of their visit, something made in British Columbia. Many,
but of course not all, can buy from the Indian women themselves. If this
cannot be done they can be obtained from stores specializing in such
things and which usually give the printed story of the design. They are
also secured by the residents of these regions to send to their friends
over-seas and elsewhere.

The Haidas of the Queen Charlotte Islands, their kin in Alaska and the
related Tsimshians were the most cultured tribes among the Coast
Indians. Intercourse with the "Paleface" has greatly modified the trend
of their genius. The baskets have suffered as well as the weaving of
beautiful woolen cloth of exceptional fineness. Although slate totem
poles and coin silver work have been improved considerably in the last
decade or so, this art is now on the decline. The older workers of these
arts are joining the spirits of their ancestral totems.

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

The basket work of each tribe varied, the Haidas originally made theirs
in a bird-cage weave, using them for berrying, packing, crab nets and
other purposes. These forms were also used by the Kwakiutls. At present
they make their baskets mostly out of spruce roots, whereas, at one
time, cedar bark was used more extensively. This fiber was made into
cord, rope and matting, a material that all the Northwest tribes used.
The spruce root baskets are very sturdy, the warp runs straight up
instead of at an angle like that of the Nootka baskets. They are
decorated with geometrical symbols in colors with a straw-like grass,
some of them resembling the Greek Key. The designs are woven on the
outside of the basket and never show through.

The Tsimshians made baskets of a similar weave to the Haidas but
depended more on the cedar bark for material, though they have adopted
the spruce root fiber in late years. Their older types were very rough
and crude and are a great contrast, considering that the women folk of
all tribes have such capable hands, doing their work with such beauty
and loving care.

The Yak-utats of the Thlin-gets, who live along the Alaskan waterways,
have a legend that the first basket was made in Skyland by the wife of
the Sun, who had such a large family of children that she wished to
place them on the Earth. One day she began to weave a basket of spruce
roots with a long cord attached so that her children could be let down
in to the world below. The Sun gazed proudly at his wife and her work,
of which she soon became master, then teacher. Between them they wove a
strong, flexible basket that was richly decorated with
[outstanding](errata.htm#11.md) angular shapes of the
Shining-Heavens-People.

The art and technique of basket making is gradually being improved by
these simple children of nature. The materials for their weaving are
collected in the early Spring when the sap begins to flow. At that time
the bark is more easily removed from the root without its being injured.
This requires great skill and practice. A specially shaped knife is used
for the task which is generally done by the older and more experienced
women. Grasses for decorating the baskets are picked in early summer
before they mature. It is split and bleached in the sun, it is then
dipped in boiling water and dyed in various colors. There are six
different weaves as well as forty shapes. They are quite pliable and
will endure hard use for years. When new the baskets are a beautiful
cream that, in time, changes to a brownish shade. The Thlin-gets take
great care with their patterns and handle them admirably.

The Attu women who live on the Island of Attu, one of the Aleutians,
that chain of islands along the Great Circle of the Ocean's Highway to
the Orient, have the reputation of making the finest woven baskets of
all the Northern Indians. These are made from a grass collected at the
end of summer. A thin strip is taken off the center rib with a needle
and then is tested for its strength and color. The grass is seasoned by
putting it in a cloth bag hung up in the house until ready for use. The
baskets are made in a twining weave as fine as sewing and,

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

being of such texture that it is supposed by some that the Attu baskets
are woven under water. One lady tourist, so it is reported, could not
understand how the Indians could sit beneath the cold, cold water and
weave baskets. Such is not the case, the grass is merely kept damp with
water to keep it from becoming brittle while being woven.

If you are not already a collector of Indian basket work you will find
it an absorbing hobby. You cannot help but think of these women sitting
in their humble homes through the long rainy days and nights, telling
tales to their children and other listeners, weaving the patterns and
symbols that are to be passed on to strangers who will probably never
know their real meanings. Some tell the stories of their legendary
heroes and others the joys and sorrows of the weaver. The Indians think
that their white brothers are queer people. They get a great deal of
amusement out of observing the tourist while the tourist is absorbed in
observing them. There is one language that all the Indians know: "Buy
Basket" "Cheap, Cheap," "Some Clothes," "Some Money."
