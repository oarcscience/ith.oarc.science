### THE SQUIRREL

A young man has killed many squirrels. One day he sees a white squirrel
climbing a spruce tree. He goes around the tree to get a shot and finds
that the squirrel is the daughter of the chief of the squirrels. He is
called into the house. The chief asks him to burn the meat and bones of
the squirrels whom he has killed and thus to restore the squirrel people
to life. In return he promises to make the hunter a shaman and gives him
a dance and a song. After some time the youth's dried-up body is found
on the tree. It is taken to

his father's house and placed on a mat, and during the mourning ceremony
he revives. The squirrel meat is burned and the youth becomes a great
shaman.
