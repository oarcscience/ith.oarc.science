### THE PORCUPINE AND THE BEAVER

The Beaver invites the Porcupine to his house, carries him over the
water, and gives him sticks to eat. They agree to play together. The
Beaver carries the Porcupine through the water and almost drowns him.
The Porcupine then invites the Beaver to visit him and takes him over
slippery ice to a tree which he climbs and lets himself fall down. He
carries the Beaver up. The Porcupine lets go of the tree and shouts
"Space!" and is not hurt when he strikes the ground; but the Beaver
shouts "Rock!" and his belly bursts when he lands on the ground.
