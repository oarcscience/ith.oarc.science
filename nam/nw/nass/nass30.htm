<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE PORCUPINE AND THE BEAVER</H3>
<P>The Beaver invites the Porcupine to his house, carries him over the water, and gives him sticks to eat. They agree to play together. The Beaver carries the Porcupine through the water and almost drowns him. The Porcupine then invites the Beaver to visit him and takes him over slippery ice to a tree which he climbs and lets himself fall down. He carries the Beaver up. The Porcupine lets go of the tree and shouts "Space!" and is not hurt when he strikes the ground; but the Beaver shouts "Rock!" and his belly bursts when he lands on the ground.</P>
