# ROTTEN-FEATHERS

\[The continuation of this story from page [100](nass10.htm#page_100.md),
line 6, was told by Chief Mountain, as follows:\]

Twice she tried to cut it, then the feather snapped and the boys all
fell down. The eldest one kept the feather and received the name
Rotten-feathers. At the same time when the boys fell down a great many
bones fell down from heaven. Rotten-feathers moved the feather over them
four times and the bones became again living people.

Then the brothers went to Skeena river. Little-grindstone ate of the
berries that were growing there and was transformed into a mountain that
may be seen to this day. The brothers traveled on and reached a mountain
which they were unable to pass. Rotten-feathers moved his feather over
it and the mountain melted down. The molten rock may still be seen.

Finally they came to a canyon. They saw a town on the other side of the
river and a bridge leading across to it. Here they met a woman named
Great-goose (Wī-ksEm-ha'x), who warned them. She said, "You cannot cross
this bridge. If you try to do so, it will break and you will be drowned.
On the other side lives Chieftainess Knife-hand (Haq?ôLEm-an?o'n), who
has a beautiful daughter. She cuts off with her hands the heads of all
her daughter's suitors." Rotten-feathers thought he could overcome her
by means of his magic feather. He crossed the bridge in safety and
entered the house. The old woman laughed when she saw him, and
immediately asked her daughter to spread the bed. At night he lay down
with the young woman. He had his hair tied in a bunch on top of his head
and in it he had hidden his feather. As soon as the young woman was fast
asleep he arranged his own hair like that of a woman and tied the young
woman's hair in a topknot. Then he pretended to be asleep. Soon the old
woman came. She felt of the heads of the sleepers. She believed her
daughter to be the stranger and cut off her head. Then Rotten-feathers
tied up his hair again and put the feather on top. He took the labret of
the dead woman. Therefore he received the name Labret. The feather
carried him back across the river. Great-goose greeted him, saying, "My
son, did you come back safely?" He told her what had happened. On the
following morning Knife-hand came across the river wailing, "My child!
my child! Sister Great-goose, how did it happen that your child became a
great supernatural being?" Great goose replied, "The heavens were clear
when my child was born, therefore she has become a great supernatural
being, sister." Then Knife-band said, "O, yes, sister Great-goose."

Rotten-feathers, who had now the name Labret, heard that a supernatural
being named Sleep had a beautiful wife. He desired to abduct her, and,
notwithstanding Great-goose's warning, he set out. He reached the house
and found Sleep fast asleep. He told Sleep's wife that he had come to
abduct her. She was willing to elope with him. She told him that Sleep
had a very fast canoe, which traveled by itself. They went aboard this
canoe and escaped. Sleep had a chamber-pot whose office it was to wake
him if any danger approached. The pot knocked him on the head and the
urine ran over his face, but he did not awake. Then a wooden maul, whose
office it was also to wake him, knocked him on the head until he awoke.
The maul said, "Labret abducted your wife." Immediately Sleep launched a
canoe and set out to pursue the fugitives. Soon he descried them. He
shouted, "Stop, Labret, else I shall raise rocks in front of you." When
the couple paddled on Sleep raised a mountain right in front of them,
but Labret moved his feather against it and thus opened a passage. Sleep
continued his pursuit. When he approached he ordered Labret to stop,
threatening to put his comb in front of him. When Labret paddled on,
Sleep threw the comb ahead and thus made a dense forest in front of the
fugitives. Labret, however, moved his feather against the woods and so
made a passage through it. Thus the couple escaped safely. The mask of
Sleep is used up to this day by the G\*ispawaduwE'da.
