### THE GRIZZLY BEAR

The eldest of four brothers goes hunting with his two dogs. He comes to
a glacier, which he crosses, and suddenly finds himself in front of the
den of a Grizzly Bear, who kills him and his dogs. The second and third
brothers meet the same fate. The youngest, on reaching the den, falls
into it and strikes with his hand the Bear's vulva. She marries him.
After some time be gets homesick and returns, accompanied by his bear
wife. They live with his parents and the Bear makes friends with the
man's child and with his former wife, whom she allows to return to him.
The Bear and this woman go berrying, the Bear keeping the berries in her
stomach. On their return they invite the people in. The Bear defecates
the berries into a dish, but the people are afraid to eat them. The Bear
robs a man's salmon weir, taking out the fish before daylight. She gives
the fish to the people. The owner of the weir scolds her and she kills
him. She goes back to the mountains, and tells her husband, who tries to
follow her, to go home. When he does not obey, she kills him.
