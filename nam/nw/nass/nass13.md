# Smoke-hole

\[Told by Moses\]

There was a man who never slept in his house. He always lay at the edge
of his smoke-hole. Therefore he grew exceedingly strong. When he went to
gather firewood, he pulled out a whole tree and carried it home on his
shoulder. In the evening, when he had eaten, he went up and lay down at
the edge of the smoke-hole. Therefore his name was Smoke-hole. Nobody
could carry what he was able to carry. He always carried firewood on his
shoulders. He carried whole trees on his shoulders.
