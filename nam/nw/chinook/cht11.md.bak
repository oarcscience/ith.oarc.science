# 8. Ênts<u>!</u>X

Ênts<u>!</u>X's grandmother was Upê'qciuc. She always asked him to go
elk hunting. Early every morning he started, but he killed only
chipmunks and squirrels; sometimes he killed mice. Oftentimes he went
and stayed on a prairie. He shouted: "Come down from the woods, elk! we
will fight, we will dance." Down came the rabbit. "You are the one I
have called, your ears are like spoons with long handles." Then the
rabbit cried and went back. Then he called again: "Come down from the
woods, elk! we will fight, we will dance." Down came a deer. "You are
the one I have called, your eyes are like huckleberries." Then the deer
cried and went back. He called again: "Come down from the woods, elk! we
will fight, we will dance." Down came a female elk. "You are the one
whom I have called!" He called again: "Come down from the woods, elk! we
will fight, we will dance." Then a male elk came down. Now Êntsx danced
and sang: "Where shall I go into him? Where shall I go into him? I think
I will go into his mouth. No, he will spit and I shall get full of
saliva. I think I will go into his nostrils. No he will snort and I
shall get full of mucus. I think I will go into his ear. No, he will
shake himself and I shall fall down. I think I shall go into his anus.
No, he will defecate and I shall get full of excrements." After some
time he entered his anus. Now he cut his stomach to pieces. After a
little while the elk fell down and died. Then Êntsx skinned and
dissected it. He cut off the hind-legs; he cut off the fore-legs. He cut
off the head, the neck, the ribs, and the rump bone. Then he went home.
When he came to his grandmother he said: "I killed an elk, grandmother!"
"Perhaps it was a mouse." "No, it has horns, it has horns, it is an
elk." "Then perhaps it was a snail." "No, no, I killed an elk, an elk."
"Perhaps it was a chipmunk." "No, no, I killed an elk, an elk." "Perhaps
it was a squirrel." Then she got tired and they went into the woods.
They arrived at the place where the elk lay. Êntsx asked: "What do you
want to carry, grandmother? Do you want to carry its head?" "It will
pull me down headlong, grandson." "What do you want to carry,
grandmother? Do you want to carry its neck?" "It will pull me down
headlong, grandson." "What do you want to carry, grandmother? Do you
want to carry its hind-legs?" "They will pull me down headlong,
grandson." "What do you want to carry, grandmother? Do you want to carry
its fore-legs?" "They will pull me down headlong, grandson." "What do
you want to carry, grandmother? Do you want to carry its breast?" "It
will pull me down headlong, grandson." "What do you want to carry,
grandmother? Do you want to carry its back?" "It will pull me down
headlong, grandson." "What do you want to carry, grandmother? Do you
want to carry its rump bone?" "Tie it tip, tie it up, grandson." Then he
tied it up, she put it up, she raised it on her back. The old

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

woman ran ahead of her grandson, who carried the rest of the elk. They
went home. After a little while he came near his grandmother, who had
put her load on the ground and pushed it to and fro, singing at the same
time.

He reached her and asked: "What are you doing there, grandmother?" "It
pulled me down headlong, grandson." Then she took it again on her back
and ran. He went on. Then he saw her again sitting down and pushing her
load to and fro and singing. \[He asked:\] "What are you doing there,
grandmother?" "It pulled me down headlong, grandson." Five times he
overtook her, when they reached home.

\[Êntsx said:\] "Now go and bring some water, grandmother, we will boil
the elk." His grandmother took five buckets and went out. She went a
short distance, urinated and filled all the buckets. Then she went home.
Her grandson asked her: "Where did you get that water, grandmother?" She
named a river. Then he took up another bucket and asked: Where did you
get this water, grandmother?" "This I took from the upper fork of Bear
creek," she replied. Thus she named a new creek for each bucket.

Now they boiled the elk. The old woman turned her back toward the fire
and made holes in Êntsx's shell spoons, wooden spoons, and born dishes.
When the food was done they took it away from the fire. Êntsx said:
"Bring me my shell spoon which I used when I was a child." "There is a
hole in it, grandson." "Then give me my wooden spoon which I used when I
was a child." "There is a hole in it, grandson." "Then give me the spoon
made of mountain-sheep horn." "There is a hole in it, grandson." "Then
give me my toy canoes which I used when I was a child." "There are holes
in them, grandson."

"Have they all holes?" he said. Then he took the boiling food and poured
it over his grandmother,. She was scalded and her legs and arms became
doubled up. Then he rolled her up in the elk skin, threw her into the
river and she drifted down to a place where Winter Robin and Blue-Jay
were fishing with a dipnet.

Robin saw an elk skin drifting down and said: "Ah! an elk comes down to
me." Then Blue-Jay said: "Robin, do you hear? they call us?" Then Robin
said: "Ah! an elk comes down to me." Then Blue-Jay said: "Ah! hahahaha."
Five times Robin said: "An elk comes down to me." Then Blue-Jay
understood what he said and called himself: "Ah! an elk comes down to
me." "Where does it come?" \[Blue-Jay pointed out.\] "Here, here, here"
\[pointing in all directions because he did not see it\]. Then they saw
the elk and took it. They put it into their canoe \[and saw that\] it
was tied up. They unfastened the strings and \[out came\] their aunt.
"Oh, behold our aunt!" "How shall we wail for her, Robin?" Then Robin
sung: "O Êntsx, Êntsx, he killed her, he killed her, our aunt, our
aunt." "That is a good song," said Blue-Jay. Now they went home, and
when they came near their

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

town they began to wail. Oh, the poor ones, how they do wail?" said the
people. They sang: "Êntsx, Êntsx, he killed her, he killed her, our
aunt, our aunt." They landed and the people went down to see them. Then
they carried the body of Upê'qciuc up to the house. They tried to cure
her. After a while she recovered. Then they asked her: "What \[?\]." She
named \[a bird\]. "She named the eldest one," said Blue-Jay. "Pull his
canoes into the water." Again they asked her. She named Robin. "She
named the eldest one," said Blue-Jay. She named all the people. Last of
all she named Blue-Jay. Now they launched his canoes and they went to
make war upon Ênts<u>!</u>x. Two canoes full of people went.

They went a long distance and met two people asleep, a man and a woman.
Blue-Jay went ashore. He took the man by his hair in his right hand and
he took the woman in his left. Then he took them to his canoe and made
them his slaves. When they traveled along these two persons were dancing
\[in Blue-Jay's canoe\]. The latter said: "Robin! These two persons were
our grandfather's slaves; they always carried me on the, back and led
you by the hand. They were our great-great-grandfather's slaves." "Iä-a,
they are only your slaves. Do you think that I do not know my slaves?"
replied Robin. "Pshaw! he is older than I am and does not remember it!"
Now the two persons danced and sang: "Near the trees we always dance,
watlala guyu, guyu, guyu, guyu."

Then Blue-Jay said: "They always say: 'Close to the trees, close to the
trees'". "Iä" replied Robin, "thus they will run away from you." And
indeed so it happened. \[When they got a little farther they came to\] a
tree which hung over the water. \[The man and the woman\] jumped up and
escaped by running \[over the tree\]. Blue-Jay ran in pursuit. He came
inland. Then he called anah, anah. When he came back to the canoe his
legs were full of blood \[and he said to his brother Robin\]: "Why did
you not go inland? They nearly killed me. That man took hold of my head
and the woman struck my legs." \[Robin laughed and replied:\] "Iä, they
were the squirrel and chipmunk whom you caught."

They traveled on. They went a long distance and met one man who was
sitting in his canoe. He fished with a dipnet. Blue-Jay said: "My
nephew, you have a pretty canoe." "I borrowed it." "My nephew, you have
a pretty paddle." "I borrowed it." "My nephew, you have a pretty
bailer." "I borrowed it." "My nephew, you have a pretty dip-net." "I
borrowed it." "My nephew, you have a pretty mat in your canoe." "I
borrowed it." \[Then Blue-Jay got angry and said:\] "Do you borrow
everything?" He took hold of his head and threw him into his canoe. He
said: "Give me that rope and I will tie him." \[The man whom he had
caught replied:\] "I shall scratch your ropes to pieces." \[Then
Blue-Jay said:\] "Give me a rope of spruce limbs." "I shall scratch it
to pieces." "What shall I take to

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

tie him with? Give me strings of dentalia. "I shall scratch them to
pieces. "Ha, ha, ha," he cried then; "sea-grass, sea-grass!" "Give me
sea-grass, give me sea-grass, quick Robin." Now he tied the hands and
the feet of that man. Then he threw him into the water. The water began
to boil where they had thrown him down. \[Blue-jay cried:\] "O, my
nephew, he scolds. I killed my nephew." \[Robin remarked:\] "Iä, he is
laughing at you here." "Pshaw, a man does not laugh when he is thrown
into the water" \[said Blue-Jay\].

Now the people went on, and after awhile they saw a person who held
arrows in his hands. \[He said:\] "Tell me the news, Blue-Jay!" "I have
nothing to tell you, only that I threw my relative down there into the
water." "I am the one," said that person. "Iä," cried Robin, "that is
the one whom you threw into the water."

They went on to Ênts<u>!</u>x's house. They surrounded it and set it on
fire. When it began to burn Ênts<u>!</u>x flew out through a knothole.
When the, whole house was burnt, Blue-Jay found a \[mink's\] head. "Oh
that is Ênts<u>!</u>x's head!" he shouted. But Robin said: be went out
already." Now the people went home and left Ênts<u>!</u>x.
