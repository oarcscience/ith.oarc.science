# War.

Before the people go to war they sing. If one of them sees blood, he
will be killed in battle. When two see blood, they will be killed. They
finish their singing. When they sing, two long planks are put down
parallel to each other. All the warriors sing. They kneel \[on the
planks\]. Now they go to war and fight. When people of both parties have
been killed, they stop. After some time the two parties exchange
presents and make peace. When a feud has not yet been settled, they
marry a woman to a man of the other town and they make peace.
