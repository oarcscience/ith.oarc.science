# Elk Hunting.

When a hunter has killed a male elk far away, then twelve men go to
fetch it. When he has killed a female elk, eight go to fetch it. When

a hunter has killed two elks, many people go to fetch it. When he has
killed many, then it is dried in the woods \[it is not carried away\].
The people go home when it is dry, and the hunter distributes the meat
among all the people.

A menstruating woman must not take the head of an elk. Women do not eat
the tongue; only men eat it. They do not break the bones of the
forelegs. These are carried faraway, else a menstruating woman might see
them. When such a woman eats the feet and hoofs, the hunter will be
unlucky. When she steps over an elk's head, she will be sick with
dropsy. Just so a girl who has just reached maturity. She does not look
at an elk, else she will be sick with dropsy. When a hunter is
unsuccessful, his child must not go near the water. When it goes near
water, it will fall sick and die at once. When he goes hunting, his wife
and children sit motionless. His wife must not go anywhere. When his
children make noise, one of them will fall sick if the hunter is
unsuccessful.
