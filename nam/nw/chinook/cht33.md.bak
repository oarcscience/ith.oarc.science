# The Potlatch.

When a chief intends to give a potlatch, four, five, or six men are sent
out in a canoe \[to invite the guests\]. One man who has a guardian
spirit is sent among them. When they approach a town the man who has the
guardian spirit sings. The people of that town hear him and say, "Oh, we
are going to be invited." The messengers land and tell the people to
come. Then they go to the next town. After having visited all the towns
they go home. Now the people make themselves ready. They wait for those
who live farthest away. When they arrive they all go down the river
together. Thus they do also when a chief on the upper part of the river
has sent an invitation. They go up the river together. When they reach
the town to which they were invited they put their canoes side by side
and lay planks across. This is done with all their canoes. Now they
dance, and those who have guardian spirits sing. The people dance on the
planks. Their faces are painted red, their hair is strewn with down. All
the women wear their dentalia, their ear and hair ornaments, and their
necklaces. They wear good blankets. Braves wear their head ornaments and
their faces are blackened. Shamans carry their batons. They sing and
finally land. Then they tell a woman, "You shall be our head dancer."
She replies, "No; I do not dare to do it." One who knows how to dance
well is made head dancer, a man or a woman. Now they enter the house
dancing. When a woman \[while dancing\] bends her head, another one goes
and raises it. Then she pays her for having made her head straight. When
a person gets out of rhythm, he is taken to the side of the house and
must sit down there. All those who have

guardian spirits sing. When the people of one town have finished, those
of another town enter dancing. When there are not many people of one
town, those of two towns enter together. When the house is large, the
people of three towns will enter together.

If the host has too little food, two youths are sent and told, "Go and
ask my relatives to bring food." The youths go to a town and ask the
\[host's relatives\] to bring food. They all come and bring food. They
also dance on the canoes and land. They enter the house dancing. When
they bring dry salmon, five men hold it in their mouths while they enter
the house dancing. When they bring roots, five men carry them on their
backs when they enter the house dancing. After the people have danced
five days they receive presents. One man is asked \[to stand near the
host and\] to name the people. First he names the chief of one town.
When the host is liberal, he gives the man who calls out the names a
blanket. Or he is given long dentalia. After one town is finished,
another one receives presents. Again first the chief is called. When he
drags his present he is called back. Men as well as women are thus given
presents.

The people are forbidden to shoot with arrows during the potlatch. If a
man should want to fight against the people of a town and shoot an
arrow, then the people would fight and several would be killed.

The women receive each a fathom of short dentalia. Only men are given
long dentalia. Common men receive short dentalia. If a chief has many
dentalia, then every one receives two fathoms of short dentalia.
