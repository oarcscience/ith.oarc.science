# The First Ship Seen by the Clatsop

The son of an old woman had died. She wailed for him a whole year and
then she stopped. Now one day she went to Seaside. There she used to
stop, and she returned. She returned walking along the beach. She nearly
reached Clatsop; now she saw something. She thought it was a whale. When
she came near it site saw two spruce trees standing upright on it. She
thought, "Behold! it is no whale. It is a monster." She reached the
thing that lay there. Now she saw that its outer side was all covered
with copper. Ropes were tied to those spruce trees and it was full of
iron. Then a bear came out of it. He stood on the thing that lay there.
He looked just like a bear, but his face was that of a human being. Then
she went home. Now she thought of her son, and cried, saying, "Oh, my
son is dead and the thing about which we heard in tales is on shore."
When she nearly reached the town she continued to cry. \[The people
said,\] "Oh, a person comes crying. Perhaps somebody struck her." The
people made themselves ready. They took their arrows. An old man said,
"Listen!" Then the people listened. Now she said all the time, "Oh, my
son is dead, and the thing about which we heard in tales is on shore."
The people said,

\[paragraph continues\] "What may it be?" They went running to meet her.
They said, "What is it?" "Ah, something lies there and it is thus. There
are two bears on it, or maybe they are people." Then the people ran.
They reached the thing that lay there. Now the people, or what else they
might be, held two copper kettles in their hands. Now the first one
reached there. Another one arrived. Now the person's took their hands to
their mouths and gave the people their kettles. They had lids. The men
pointed inland and asked for water. Then two people ran inland. They hid
themselves behind a log. They returned again and ran to the beach. One
man climbed up and entered the thing. He went down into the ship. He
looked about in the interior of the ship; it was full of boxes. He found
brass buttons in strings half a fathom long. He went out again to call
his relatives, but they had already set fire to the ship. He jumped
down. Those two persons had also gone down. It burnt just like fat. Then
the Clatsop gathered the iron, the copper, and the brass. Then all the
people learned about it. The two persons were taken to the chief of the
Clatsop. Then the chief of the one town said, "I want to keep one of the
men with me." The people almost began to fight. Now one of them was
taken to one town. Then the chief was satisfied. Now the Quenaiult, the
Chehalis, the Cascades, the Cowlitz, and the Klickatat learned about it
and they all went to Clatsop. The Quenaiult, the Chehalis, and the
Willapa went. The people of all the towns went there. The Cascades, the
Cowlitz, and the Klickatat came down the river. All those of the upper
part of the river came down to Clatsop. Strips of copper two fingers
wide and going around the arm were exchanged for one slave each. A piece
of iron as long as one-half the forearm was exchanged for one slave. A
piece of brass two fingers wide was exchanged for one slave. A nail was
sold for a good curried deerskin. Several nails were given for long
dentalia. The people bought this and the Clatsop became rich. Then iron
and brass were seen for the first time. Now they kept these two persons.
One was kept by each chief; one was at the Clatsop town at the cape.
