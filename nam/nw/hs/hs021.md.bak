On account of what news of your daughters' going down to you (to The
Land of Souls) did you come up for something, well brought up ones?  
There is now no one to attend to you on account of your crying, where
you are crying about (because there are now no slaves), well brought up
one, where you are crying about, well brought up one.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_21"></span>[16:2](hs021.htm#fr_25.md) The second verse of this
song is identical with this one, except that ûgô'ñ<u>g</u>aña ("your
fathers") is said to be substituted for the words gûdjã+<u>g</u>aña
("your daughters"), but <u>g</u>ô'ñ<u>g</u>a is properly applied only to
a man's father.
