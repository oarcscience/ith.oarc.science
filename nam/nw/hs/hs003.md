You need not think that the smoke of your house in the middle of Skedans
will be as great as when you were a woman (in your previous life upon
earth <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0).md).

You need not think that they will make such a continual noise of singing
in Skedans Creek as they used to when you were a woman (in your previous
existence).
