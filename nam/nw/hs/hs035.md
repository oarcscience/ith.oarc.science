### Footnotes

<span id="fn_39"></span>[24:2](hs035.htm#fr_43.md) A place north of Cape
Ball.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[25:1](hs035.htm#fr_44.md) Chiefs' children used to
be placed high up on blankets in the centre of trading-canoes so that
they could look about. Here the baby is reminded of what she used to do
in a former existence.
