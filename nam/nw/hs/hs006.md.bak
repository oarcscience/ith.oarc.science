### Footnotes

<span id="fn_3"></span>[7:1](hs006.htm#fr_3.md) Aya is equivalent to wa.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[7:2](hs006.htm#fr_4.md) The father of an Eagle girl
must give away blankets to this boy's parents, so that he will marry no
one else when he grows up. That is what "taking off his head" means. The
reference to his poverty is made with mock humility.
