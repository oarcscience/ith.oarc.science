My child is a boy because he is going to do as his grandfather did when
one went to his place long ago.  
After he had been there, his canoe was so deeply laden (with gifts),
that they had to put the weather-boards on it (to increase its
capacity);  
For it my child is going to be a leader.  
Be careful, be careful, my chief! Be careful, be careful, my master!
