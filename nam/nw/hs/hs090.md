When ULa'mAn <span id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_81) lay in sight on the
sea, the captain looked about upon his companions (allowing them to
relax their efforts).  
Make yourself a chief's son, dear.  
Again he is a chief, is a chief, is a chief.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_81"></span>[55:1](hs090.htm#fr_87) ULa'mAn is a long, low
hill near Rose Spit, generally the first sighted by canoes from Port
Simpson and neighboring places in the Tsimshian country. The mother is
probably thinking of the time when her child will come home from trading
with the Tsimshian. A third song, which I was unable to obtain in Haida,
tells in the first verse about intermarriages between the young men of
the Sk<u>î</u>'daoqao and young women of the StA'stas; in the second
verse, of intermarriage with women of the G<u>î</u>t<u>î</u>'ns of
Masset.
