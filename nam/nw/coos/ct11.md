### 8. THE GIRLS AND THE STARS.

People lived on a small place. Many people lived (there). So thus spoke
the oldest sister: "How would it be if we should lie down outside? It's
a beautiful night (to) lie down." They all were talking thus: "It will
certainly be good if we lie down outside." They were all women. So they
went outside. There they went to bed. Now they began to make fun. They
were almost asleep. They looked tip and saw many stars. Then the younger
sister said, "Suppose these stars should be our two husbands." Then the
older sister said, "Which one do you want?"--"I want some very small
star." Thus she spoke. "Which one do you want?"--"I want some big star."
Then they fell asleep. They no longer knew (anything). They were asleep.

They awoke early in the morning. (To her) surprise, a man was lying by
her side when she awoke. Indeed, she looked at him. (To her) surprise,
it was an old man (who) lay (there). His head (was covered with) gray
hair. Suddenly she was surprised to see a man at the side of (her) older
sister, a big star. A very pretty man was at the side of her older
sister. The woman was astonished. Thus the man was talking: "I am the
one (whom) you wanted (last) night."

Thus they know about the Star-Men. They don't know what became of them.

Thus the story is being told. Here it ends.
