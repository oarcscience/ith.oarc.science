### 27. THE WOMAN WHO MARRIED THE DOG.

A young girl lived in Takimiya. She had five elder brothers. She was
always making baskets. Outside she had her separate little house. She
used to work there. She also had a pretty little dog there. Many men
wanted to buy her in marriage, but she did not want a husband.

Once she was working in her little house. A pretty man came to her. He
asked her all (kinds of questions). <span id="page_169">p. 169</span>
"What do you usually do with your dog? What does your dog usually do?"
Thus she informed him: "Whenever I go inside to eat, I always give my
dog separately. Whenever I go to bed, the dog lies down under (my) bed."
Then he spoke to her thus: "I am your husband." Then he killed her
little dog, skinned it, and put its (hide) on. Then he looked just like
the little dog.

It was an underground house, and had a ladder. In the evening he would
take off the dog's hide, and lie down there with his wife. And she
became pregnant. So her older brothers were asking her, "Who made you
pregnant? Who (is) your husband?" The eldest brothers did not seem to
care. They asked her, but she did not tell. The youngest brother
(however) was thinking thus: "Why is it that she takes such good care of
this dog?" Thus he said to his elder brothers. "You hit that dog." Their
sister was getting big (with child). One day after a meal the woman went
out on the ladder. The dog was following her on the ladder. The youngest
brother took a bow, and hit the little dog with an arrow. The dog jumped
outside and howled. She was sorry, and followed her dog into the forest.
So she found her dog lying dead, and she buried it.

She did not go home: she kept on walking. She followed a small river
(leading) to the forest. Then she built a house there. She had there for
food small trout. And the two children were born. They grew fast. And
they two were hunting. Coon, wildcat, fisher, deer,--they two killed
them all, and this was their food. When they came back (from) hunting,
they two informed their mother: "We two saw (some) people. (Their hair)
was cut short, and they were crying. They seemed to be looking for
something."

One (day) she told her children (how it was) that they were living
there. "At first your (dual) father came to me. I had a little dog, and
he killed it and put its hide on." Then another (day) she informed her
children thus: "My youngest brother killed that little dog. He did not
know (it was a) person.'

Then one (day) she spoke thus to her children: "I will go home. I will
see my folks." Then, indeed, she went home. She saw her relatives. Thus
she was talking: "I (have) two children. The little dog was my husband.
The children I have are his." Her oldest brother thus spoke to her:
"Your children shall return; I will give them all my money; to both of
them I will give a wife." Then they went to get (the children). When
these two saw them coming, they two shot arrows at them. The), were
merely frightening them thus. They two were doing it that way just for
fun. So then they took the children back to Takimiya. When the children
grew up, they were very strong (men). They were great shinny-players.
They were great gamblers. They were experts in wrestling. No matter who
(it was), they two would still throw him.
