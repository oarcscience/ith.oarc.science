### 7. ORIGIN OF THE COOS PEOPLE.

One man was travelling. He was a "bone-man." An old man met him. "Why
are you walking all the time? Why do you talk? Why are people angry with
you?" He grabbed him. They two fought. Then the man was killed and torn
to pieces. His intestines were taken out. He laid down the paunch
separately. The hands he laid down separately, and also the head he laid
down separately. Everything he laid down separately.

Then he (began) to think, as he was standing, "What am I going to do
with it?" Thus he was thinking. "Wouldn't it be good if I should scatter
it everywhere?" To the south he scattered the hair. To the south he
scattered the blood. To the east he scattered the flesh. To the north he
scattered the paunch. To the north he scattered the bones.

Then he spoke thus: "You shall be nothing. The last <span
id="page_51">p. 51</span> generation shall see you. Wherever there is a
river, there people will live."

The people who speak Hânîs, those (come from) the hair. The blood,
that's the Siletz Indians. The paunch, that's the Siuslaw; the flesh,
that's the Kalapooya; (and) the bones are the Umpqua Indians. That's the
way (in which) it was started.
