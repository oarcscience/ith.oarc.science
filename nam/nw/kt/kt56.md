### Ô'?mâ~~l~~ Paints the Birds.

Then Ô'?mâ~~l~~ painted his tribe. They carried up the fishes. Then the
harlequin duck, and the buffle-head, and all the birds, and all the
animals, were, painted. Then the land seaward emerged. (Ô'?mâ~~l~~) was
in a hurry, and he only rubbed coal over the raven, and he also rubbed
clay over the sea-gull. Then they went down to the beach and picked up
the fish,--halibut and all kinds of fish. The squirrel and the mouse
went many times. Then the flood-tide came quickly. The flood came. It
reached several of the people of Ô'?mâ~~l~~. These dived on the islands;
and those who were not caught by the sea became the land-birds. The
flood came quickly. The snail had not gone down to the beach.
