# 39. ?nEmô'gwis. <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md)

Tradition of Sî'sEnLê?, a Clan of the Nimkish.

?nEmô'gwis travelled northward, coming from Seymour Narrows. He made war
upon the people and destroyed many villages. Finally he went up Nimkish
River, and came to the mountain Ts!Ex\*ê'wak<sup>u</sup>. There he
acquired supernatural power. A goose (nEla') came to live with him,
assumed the form of a person, and became the ancestor of his tribe. They
lived in Foundation (<u>X</u>ulk<sup>u</sup>). When the goose assumed
the shape of a person, his wife also became a human being, and they had
many children. They came to be a bad people. ?nEmô'gwis and the goose
are the ancestors of the Sî'sEnLê?.

?nEmx\*â'likô is also given as the name of the ancestors of the
Sî'sEnLê?.
