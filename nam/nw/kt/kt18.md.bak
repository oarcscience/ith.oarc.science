# Mink is deserted by his Wife.

(Dictated by Yâ'<u>g</u>ô<u>L</u>as, a ?nE'm<u>g</u>ês, 1900.)

Then he went to his house with his wife. Then his wife was pregnant, and
gave birth to a child. Her child was a boy. Then Sawbill-Duck-Woman
said, "Let us go and see the ancestors of this baby." Then he went to
Woodpecker. He said, "Please have pity on me (and give me) a little drop
for this baby." Then Born-to-be-the-Sun was given red ochre.
Born-to-be-the-Sun tried to put a little in the mouth of the child.
"Don't (put in) too much," said his wife. He just finished trying to put
a little into the mouth (of the child). "It does not taste bad, it
tastes sweet."--"Verily, that rascal has no sense. Let us just go." Then
they went home. The two were in the canoe, he and his wife. They paddled
along the rocks, and Born-to-be-the-Sun looked into the water. Then he
saw sea-eggs. He backed-water and dived headlong. Then he carried the
sea-eggs in the fold of his blanket.

\[paragraph continues\] "Go on!" said, on her part, his wife, "and stay
longer." His wife thought that she would leave him. Then
Born-to-be-the-Sun dived. He came again carrying sea-eggs in the fold of
his blanket. "Indeed, you were not long under water. Try to walk about
on the ground below. Go again and try to get plenty," said his wife, on
her part. Then he dived; and as soon as he dived, his wife paddled away.
She left him, and looked back often. When she had gone a long way,
Born-to-be-the-Sun emerged. "What are you doing, my dear? Come, I got a
great many. Oh, come!" he said, on his part. "Do come, try to be a
chieftainess,--a big chieftainess,--else I will call you an ugly one
with matted hair on the pubes." Then Born-to-the-Sun went ashore and
walked along the rocks. He sat down on the rocks and ate the sea-eggs.
He did not care that he was left by his wife. he started again. He did
not forget the sea he was anxious to eat them. He desired them much. He
was careful when he sat down on the rock and ate the sea-eggs. Then his
wife returned home, and Born-to-be-the-Sun finished having wives. He was
just left by his wife. That is the end.
