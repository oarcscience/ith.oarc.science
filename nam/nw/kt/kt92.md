# 50. Additions to the Myth of the Mink. <span id="fr_50"></span>[2](#fn_50.md)

Mink goes to war with his friend Land-Otter, against the ghosts
Lâ'laênox<sup>u</sup>. When they are travelling, Mink says that he has
lost his k\*ê'sbê. \[The story-teller did not know what this was. In
other versions it is a nose-ornament.\]

<span id="page_495">p. 495</span>

Mink's pretense for refusing to give sea-eggs to otter is that warriors
do not share their food.

The incident of the musk-bag is omitted.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The story of Mink, Eagle, and Sawbill-Duck-Woman <span
id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md) is repeated here. This story is given as
the reason why at present people cannot put away parts of their body.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

A young woman had a child, and nobody knew who the child's father was.
The people assembled and discussed who its father might be.
Born-to-be-the-Sun said, "Let the woman's father invite all the people,
and then we shall find out who the child's father is." The woman's
father did as he was told. The people assembled; and when they were all
in, Born-to-be-the-Sun said, "Let the woman and her child come here. Now
ask the child who its father is." They did so, and the child replied, "I
am Born-to-be-the-Sun's child."
