# Mink and the salmon.

(Dictated by Yâ'<u>g</u>ô<u>L</u>as, a ?nE'm<u>g</u>ês, 1900.)

He saw a salmon jumping. "Hayû'!" He said, "Hayû'! If I should jump, I
should come and jump inside of this tide-ripple." Then it came and
jumped. Again he said, "Hayû'! If I should jump, I should jump outside
of this kelp." Then it jumped there. Again he said, "Hayû'! If I should
jump, I should jump in the middle of this kelp." It came and jumped.
Again he said, Hayû'! If I should jump, I should jump on the land side
of this kelp." It came and jumped. Then again he said, "Hayû'! If I
should jump, I should jump almost on the rocks."

\[paragraph continues\] It came and jumped. "Hayû'"! If I should jump, I
should jump on the rocks here on shore." It came jumping on the rocks.
Then he tried to sit on it. "Sit on it, sit on it!" he said. Thus he
caught it.
