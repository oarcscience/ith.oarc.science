# 8. The Singing Skull.

Tradition of the ?nE'm<u>g</u>ês.

(*Dictated in* 1900.)

One morning the women were wailing in the house, while the men were out
fishing. Since many people had died, the sound of wailing was heard in
every house. Suddenly a voice was heard louder than all the wails of the
women:

"X\*aâ' x\*aâ' x\*aâ' x\*aâ'! At that time formerly I was to be taken
aboard the canoe by him who had me for his princess; but now I have only
empty orbits in the house, and holes at the bottom (of the orbits) in
the house; I who was formerly to be taken aboard the canoe by him who
had me for his princess."

The women ceased wailing when they heard this song, for the words they
heard seemed strange to them. They tried to find out where the song came
from. Finally they discovered on the floor of the house a skull which
was singing. They took it back to the graveyard. It must have rolled
down from a tree, and fallen right into the house.
