# 35. Dzâ'wadalalîs.

Tradition of the G\*ê'xsEm of the DEna'x\*da?x<sup>u</sup>.

(*Told by NEg\*ê' and Hâ'nidzEm*.)

Dzâ'wadalalîs was sent down from the sky at the time when mountains and
rivers came into existence. He came

<span id="page_456">p. 456</span>

to a pretty place called <u>L</u>ô'gwal?Eldzas. With him came a woman
named <u>L</u>ê<u>g</u>Ekwi'?lak<sup>u</sup>. They had four daughters.
The oldest was Wâ'numg\*ilayu<u>g</u>wa; the second,
<u>G</u>u'ntêla<u>g</u>; the third, Ë'k\*!âlalîsEmê<u>g</u>; the fourth,
Ë'k\*!alalä~~l~~î?laku. With him came his house, which had a snapping
door. The corner-posts of the house-front were grizzly bears.
Dzâ'wadalalîs was so famous, that people from all over the world came to
see him. The door of his house was open; but whenever a person wanted to
enter, it closed. Thus many people were killed. There was a seat in the
rear of the house the back of which was stone. On the seat was a mat
which was covered all over with sharp stone spikes (tE?na').

Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> came southward, starting from the north. He
visited all the tribes, trying to find a wife. On his way he came to
Knights Inlet. When he was passing near Alert Bay, he threw all his
clothing out of the canoe. This was transformed into the numerous
islands that lie between Vancouver Island and Knights Inlet. At that
time the mountains were all bare. He threw his comb on the mountains,
and it was transformed into trees.

While on his way, the Ma'malêleqala saw him. They shouted, "What are you
going to do, lord (?mâ'?mêLasai')?" and he replied, "I am going to marry
the daughter of Dzâ'wadalalîs." The Ma'malêleqala answered, "You are
foolish. Do you know what is going to happen? He is very dangerous.
Nobody who enters his house leaves it again alive."
Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> said, "Let us go ashore to see them." Then he
threw something ashore, and said, "You shall be the deer of later
generations." He went on.

When he came to G\*iô'x, the people saw him. They shouted, "Where are
you going?" He replied, "I am going to marry the daughter of
Dzâ'wadalalîs." The

<span id="page_457">p. 457</span>

people answered, "Take care! He is dangerous. Nobody escapes alive from
his house." Then he approached the shore, and threw fish to them. For
that reason the river of G\*iô'x is full of salmon.

Then he came to Q!walâ'd or T!ô'qo?yu. The people there shouted, "Where
are you going?" He replied, "I am going to marry the daughter of
Dzâ'wadalalîs." They replied, "You are foolish. He is very dangerous.
Nobody escapes alive from his house. Look at my face! It is cut all
over. I have tried to marry her, and I lost all my hair." While he was
still speaking, this man suddenly became a mountain, which may be seen
up to the present day. On account of its scar this mountain is called
K\*!ê'k\*!êLEmak<sup>u</sup>.

He went on and came to Ha'nwade. There he was called again; and the
people asked, "Where are you going?" He replied, "I am going to marry
the daughter of Dzâ'wadalalîs."--"Take care!" they answered. "He is
dangerous, but we wish you success." In return he threw some boiled
salmon ashore. Therefore there are many salmon in the river of Ha'nwade.

Then he came to Â'snak\*!a. There he saw many people on the beach who
were digging cinquefoil (t!Exsô's) and clover-roots (<u>L</u>Ex\*sE'm).
He went ashore at L!â'qwaxstelis. He saw smoke rising and went near. He
saw that geese and ducks were in camp there, who were steaming their
roots on red-hot stones. He went ashore and sat down next to them, and
he noticed that they were all blind. The birds at once scented him, and
one of them said, "I wonder whether our lord, G\*î'î, is here! I smell
Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup>." Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> took up what they
were steaming to look at it, and he asked, "What are you steaming here?"
They replied, "Cinquefoil-roots." Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> responded,
"This is what ravens eat. Are you

<span id="page_458">p. 458</span>

blind? Those are not roots." They replied, "We cannot see." He called
them to come near, and he spat on their eyes and questioned them, and
asked whether they could see. They said, "No, we cannot see." He spat on
their eyes a second time, and still they said they could not see,
although they were immediately able to see, but they desired to have
still better eyesight. A third time he spat on their eyes. Then they
said they could see a very little. After he had spat on their eyes a
fourth time, and when they were not yet content, he said, "Your eyesight
is good enough. If you should be able to see still better, you would see
all the monsters under water." Then the birds, who were now able to see,
asked him, "Where are you going?" He replied, "I am going to marry the
daughter of Dzâ'wadalalîs." They said, "He does not live far from here,
just above us." Then Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> left his canoe ashore, and
continued walking up the inlet. He left two seals there which he had
carried along as travelling-provisions.

When he turned the point and reached the mouth of the river, he heard a
noise. There he saw a person moving about whose head was moving from
side to side; and when he came near, he saw that it was a woman building
a canoe. He looked on for a time, and noticed that she was blind. Her
infant child was in a cradle next to her. After a while
Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> went and pinched the toe of the child. The
child began to cry. The woman said, "Don't touch my poor child!" He
repeated this three times; and the woman said, "What causes my child to
cry, although it never cried before? Somebody must be here. Don't do
that!" Then Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> said, "What are you doing here?"
She replied, "I am making a canoe." Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> asked, "Are
you unable to see what you are working at? You have cut right through

<span id="page_459">p. 459</span>

it with your adze. Are you blind?" She said, "I am blind. I cannot see
what I am doing." Then he called her and spat on her eyes, and asked,
"Can you see now?"--"No," she replied. He spat on her eyes again, and
now she was able to see a little. After he had spit on her eyes a third
time, she could see still more; and after he had repeated it a fourth
time, she could see very well. He said, "Now you can see well enough. If
your eyes should be still better, you would be able to see the monsters
under water." Then the woman asked, "Where are you going, lord?" He
replied, "I am going to marry the daughter of Dzâ'wadalalîs." She said,
"I wish you success. Come here!" He went to her, and she rubbed his
whole body with sandstone (tE?na') to make it hard. She also gave him
juice of alder-bark, bird's-down, an ermine mask, and a wren mask, and
told him what to do.

Finally he came to a place opposite Dzâ'wadê. There he sat down, and
soon the four daughters of Dzâ'wadalalîs came to bathe. When they saw
him sitting there, they said, "There is a small man sitting there,
probably he is a runaway slave." And the youngest daughter ran back to
her father and told him, "We have found a runaway slave." The father
asked her to call him into the house, and said that he was to be their
messenger and their workman. The youngest daughter went back to where
Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> was sitting, and said, "What are you doing
here? What do you want?" He replied, "I want to marry the daughter of
Dzâ'wadalalîs." Then the girls said, "We are his daughters. Pick out the
one whom you want." Then he asked for the youngest one. He went to her,
put his finger into her vagina, and the teeth tried to bite him, but he
broke them out. Then her sisters were ashamed of her. He lay down with
her and made her his wife.

<span id="page_460">p. 460</span>

The youngest daughter asked him to follow her into the house, and told
him to follow close at her heels. She said, "When the door opens, I will
go in; you must follow at once. I will go at once into my room." Then
Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> put on his ermine-skin, the girl went in, and
when the door opened again, he passed through unharmed. He went into the
room and staid there.

When Dzâ'wadalalîs discovered that his daughter was married, he muttered
angrily, "You shall not remain alive!" On the following morning he
started a large fire in the house, pretending that he intended to
prepare breakfast for his son-in-law. Then he called him out of the
room, saying that he would treat him well. He wanted him to believe that
he was going to give a feast. Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> put on his
ermine-skin, and Dzâ'wadalalîs threw him on to the mat with sharp
spikes. Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> pretended to be dead, and Dzâ'wadalalîs
threw the ermine out of the house, saying, "Serves you right! Why do you
come to make me ashamed?" but Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> returned in the
shape of an ermine.

At night Dzâ'wadalalîs heard his daughter and her husband talking
together, and he said to his wife, "With whom is our daughter whispering
there?" The woman took a torch and looked into the room, and replied,
"Our daughter's husband is back again." Then Dzâ'wadalalîs said,
"To-morrow I will treat him as my son-in-law. I will prepare a feast for
him." Then he called him. "Arise, son-in-law! I will treat you as my
son-in-law." Then Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> jumped out of the room in the
shape of a large deer. Dzâ'wadalalîs took it by the legs and threw it
down on the seat. The deer pretended to be dead, and Dzâ'wadalalîs threw
it out of the house, saying, "Serves you right! Why do you come to make
me ashamed?"

<span id="page_461">p. 461</span>

In the evening Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup>, however, returned into the
house. Soon the woman gave birth to a child, and Dzâ'wadalalîs seemed to
have given up the plan of killing his son-in-law, because he thought
that he was possessed of supernatural powers (nau'alaku). One day he
called him to go and get cedar-wood to make a cradle for the child.
Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> hid the alder-bark and the bird's down in his
armpits, under his blanket. They came to a place at the mouth of the
river where a large cedar was lying....

(When Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> was in the tree, he let the alder-juice
ooze out, which Dzâ'wadalalîs believed to be his blood; and blew out the
bird's-down, which Dzâ'wadalalîs believed to be his brains. When he was
gone, Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> put on the wren-skin, hopped over the
tree, crying, "Ts<sup>u</sup>k, ts<sup>u</sup>k" By jumping about on the
tree he split it.)

Then he assumed the shape of a man, took one half of the cedar-tree on
his shoulder, ran down to the beach, and called to Dzâ'wadalalîs, "Why
do you leave your work?" and Dzâ'wadalalîs went back to get his
son-in-law. Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> took four pieces of rotten wood and
told his father-in-law to cross just above the mouth of the river. Then
he carved porpoises (hâ'tsawê) out of the rotten wood and threw them
into the water. They began to jump against the canoe and frightened
Dzâ'wadalalîs. Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> blew and spat on them, and the
water became quiet.

Then he told Dzâ'wadalalîs to paddle on; and while they were below the
mouth of the river, he threw a second piece of wood into the water. Then
a large tree suddenly arose out of the water, and it looked as though it
were going to fall on the canoe. Then Dzâ'wadalalîs begged him to
desist. "Have pity on me!" he said. Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> replied, "I
did not begin it, I am only treating you as you have treated me."
Dzâ'wadalalîs was almost dead

<span id="page_462">p. 462</span>

with fear. Then Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> threw the third piece into the
water, which he had rubbed into a fine dust. Then the whole water began
to rise like a plank, being lifted up first on one side, then on the
other. The wind began to blow, and Dzâ'wadalalîs was very much afraid.
Many sea-monsters made their appearance. The chief sea-monster looked
like a person. Then Dzâ'wadalalîs fainted, and his intestines fell out
of his anus. Although he was in the stern of the canoe, they extended
right to the middle.

After a while, when the tide rose, the sea became quiet again. Then they
ascended the side branch of the river, going up to their house. Then
Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> jumped ashore and went to his wife. She said to
him, "You have staid away a long time. Where is your father-in-law?" He
replied, "Go and see." She went down to the canoe and found him there
dead. She said to her husband, "You have overpowered your
father-in-law." Then Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> took a piece of wood and
set fire to it at the end, and, beginning at the bow of the canoe, he
blew the fire towards Dzâ'wadalalîs, gradually walking towards the stern
of the canoe. While he was doing so, the intestines of the old man
gradually crawled back into his body, and he came to life again. When he
opened his eyes, he said, "Have I not slept a long time?"
Q!â'nêqê?lak<sup>u</sup> then took his wife and his child along. The
G\*ê'xsEm are descended from Dzâ'wadalalîs.
