# 48. Wâ'walê. <span id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md)

Tradition of the Kwâ'g\*u~~l~~.

Wâ'walê was a harpooneer who lived at Crooked-Beach
(Qâ'logw<u>î</u>s).... His son's name was <u>G</u>â'dzêdala~~l~~. (The
beginning of his story is as usual. He is a successful harpooneer, aid
he kills seals very quickly. One day he cooks seals' heads for his boy
and goes home. When it is evening, he arrives home, and finds the chief
of Crooked-Beach with his wife. He sits down on a box

<span id="page_488">p. 488</span>

outside of his room and scratches the walls. The woman thinks it is a
mouse, and says, "I wish you would gnaw Wâ'walê's face!" Then they go to
sleep. When they are sound asleep, Wâ'walê cuts off the head of the
chief, which he takes along. The woman's child awakes, and she discovers
that the chief has been killed. She tells the people who inquire why the
child cries, that he has soiled his bed. She takes her child to his
grandmother, rolls up the body in a mat, and buries it at the place
behind the houses where the children used to play throwing spears.)

In the morning the children began to play. While they were throwing
their spears, they would sometimes hear a peculiar noise when their
spear struck the ground. As a matter of fact, the spear would strike the
body of the dead chief, and as soon as they pulled it out, they
discovered that there was blood or it. The children got frightened, went
down to the beach, and told what had happened. Then the people dug up
the place and found the body. They searched for the head, but they could
not find it; and they did not know who the man was, although they
thought that it must be their chief. They asked his wife whether he had
been at home during the night, and she said that he had been away. Then
they asked Wâ'walê's wife; and she said, "I have not seen the chief."
She pretended not to know what had happened.

Soon Wâ'walê appeared at the point of land. They said, "Don't lift your
paddles! Nobody knows who has killed our chief." Then he lifted his
paddles. Then they said the same again, and he lifted his paddles again.
Then they suspected that he might have killed him, because he raised his
paddles. They said, "You raise your paddles, although our chief is
dead." And he raised them once more.

He went to his house, and his little boy was crying because he wanted
his meal. The boy ate the seal-meat that his father used to bring him.
Then he told his wife to bring the meat that he had boiled, and that was
in his bag. She took it out, and asked, "Is this it?"--"No," he said,
"it is down below." She pulled out another piece, and said, "Is this
it?" He said, "It is down below." And right at the bottom of the bag she
found the head of the chief. Then she screamed. He jumped up, pushed her
down on the head, and said, "Is that the reason of your crying? Were you
afraid of it before?" With that he cut off her head, and then he hung up
both heads over the fire.

Night came, and a woman entered to get some fire. She carried some
pitch-wood, which she lighted in the fire. Just then a drop of blood
fell down upon her hand. For the moment she did not think what it might
be; but when she went out, and when she saw the blood, she wanted to
know where it came from. She dropped her torch, so that it was
extinguished, and she went back. She pretended that the wind had blown
it out. Then she saw that blood was dripping from over the fire, and she
discovered the two heads. She went out again, and told the people that
two heads were there. Then all the people arose to fight with Wâ'walê.
He, however, pushed his house, with the ground on which it stood, out to
sea; and it became the island Mâ'~~l~~mä, in front of Crooked-Beach. He
himself and his parents were killed on this island; but his four sons
fled, jumping from one island to another, and finally reached the woods.

The four boys were fleeing through the woods. Finally the youngest one
said, "Stop! I hear the sound of chiselling." His older brothers said,
"Don't be foolish! Where should that noise come from?" And they went on.
Then the

<span id="page_490">p. 490</span>

youngest one said again, I tell you, somebody is chiselling here. I hear
it again." They listened, and then they all heard it. They went in the
direction of the sound, and

came nearer. Then they saw a large woman, the Dzô'nôq!wa, making a
canoe. Her breasts were so large that they hung down to the ground. She
sat inside, using her adze. The young man said, "What shall we do?" And
one of them remarked, "We will not be in a hurry. Let us send our
youngest brother to pinch her baby." The child was in a cradle which
stood not far from her. The youngest brother went up quietly and pinched
the child, so that it began to cry. Then the Dzô'nôq!wa said, "Don't do
that to my child! It never cries." After some time he pinched the child
again, and this was repeated four times. Then the Dzô'nôq!wa gave them
the canoe, and said, "I think you do this that I shall give you this
canoe that I am making. I am making it for you. Now you have me for your
supernatural power. I know everything about you. I know what has
happened, and therefore I give you this canoe." And she also gave them
the water of life and the death-bringer. She told the brothers, "You do
not need to paddle this canoe; just slap its sides, and it will go by
itself."

They launched the canoe. They were going to take revenge for the death
of their father. The eldest one said, "What shall we do to tease our
people? I think we will transform wood into young birds
(<u>g</u>o<u>g</u>onâ'p), so that they may come to take them. The birds
shall belong to our youngest brother." Then they went right on to
Crooked-Beach. They took many pieces of rotten wood, threw them into the
water, and transformed them into young sawbill ducks. The youngest
brother also was transformed into a sawbill duck. When the people saw
them, they went to get the birds. When they came near,

<span id="page_491">p. 491</span>

they thought that the eyes of one of the ducks looked like those of the
youngest son of Wâ'walê. Then the brothers transformed the people into
birds, and they had to remain birds. Those who had remained on shore
were killed by the death-bringer. Only those whom they liked they
revived and took them as slaves; and the eldest one resuscitated his
parents and his grandparents.
