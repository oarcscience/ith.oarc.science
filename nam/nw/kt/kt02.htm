<P ALIGN="CENTER">Tradition of the Q&ocirc;'m?&ecirc;nox<SUP>u</SUP>, a Clan of the L&ecirc;'<U>g</U>wi<STRIKE>l</STRIKE>da?x<SUP>u</SUP>.</P>

<P>Xat&ecirc;'tsEn was sitting in his house when his attendant came and said, "Don't sit here in the house, for somebody is coming to the beach here."--"Maybe this is what I am expecting, that will make things right on the beach." Then Xat&ecirc;'tsEn went out of his house to invite Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP>. Then (Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP>) entered the house of Xat&ecirc;'tsEn, and he was given dried (salmon to eat. It was dried) meat of the double-headed serpent. Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> began to eat it, and his body became contorted. Then Xat&ecirc;'tsEn spoke. "Don't urge our friend here (to eat)." Then Xat&ecirc;'tsEn and Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> went out of the house. Xat&ecirc;'tsEn looked at his salmon-weir. Then Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> transformed him into stone. Xat&ecirc;'tsEn became a man again, because he also had supernatural power. (He said,) "Go on, take warning, friend! Now I will also do something to you." Then Xat&ecirc;'tsEn transformed his friend into stone, but Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> became a man again.</P>
<P>Then he warned Xat&ecirc;'tsEn. "Take warning, friend! Now I will try you again." They took hold of each other, and Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> held Xat&ecirc;'tsEn by his sides. He lifted him up. Then Xat&ecirc;'tsEn was transformed into fog. He became a man again. Then Xat&ecirc;'tsEn spoke. "Go on, take warning, friend! Now I will do something to you also." Then Xat&ecirc;'tsEn lifted Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> and threw him upward. Then Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> also became fog. Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> became a man again.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A></P>
<P>Then Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> spoke. "Go on, take warning, friend! Now I will try to lift you from the rock." Then Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> took hold of Xat&ecirc;'tsEn and threw him upward. He transformed Xat&ecirc;'tsEn into a crane, and the crane began to fly. Xat&ecirc;'tsEn became a man again. Then he also warned Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP>. "Go on, take care, friend!" Then Xat&ecirc;'tsEn took hold of Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> and threw him upward. A crane was flying there. Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> became a man again.</P>
<P>Then Xat&ecirc;'tsEn spoke. "Oh, indeed, you have supernatural power, friend! Come, let us go to my playground." Then they went aboard his canoe, and they paddled, going to Xat&ecirc;'tsEn's play-round. They were dressed quite with the same kind of belts; namely, double-headed serpents. Double-headed serpents also were their canoes. Then they arrived at the playground.</P>
<P>Then Xat&ecirc;'tsEn spoke. "Take care, friend! else you might have a mishap on my playground. Nobody who ever tried to come and play on it has succeeded a single time. This is what makes it slippery, the blood of those who came from time to time to play here." Then Xat&ecirc;'tsEn spoke. "You go on first, friend!" Thus Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> was told by his friend. "(No,) you first," said Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP>. "You said that it is your playground."--"Let me go first, friend," said Xat&ecirc;'tsEn, on his part. Then he (Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP>) clapped on the gunwale of his canoe with his paddle, and Xat&ecirc;'tsEn ran up. Xat&ecirc;'tsEn ran straight up. He did not rest on his resting-place halfway up: he just turned round and came down again and jumped into his canoe.</P>
<P>Then Xat&ecirc;'tsEn spoke. "Now you go, friend!" Thus he said to Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP>. "Take care, fasten your belt well, else it might (drag) behind you!" Then Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> ran. He had nearly reached the top when he</P>
<P><A NAME="page_7"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 7</FONT></A></P>
<P>slipped on the rock. His belt came off, and Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> fell down. He fell into the water and sank. Then Xat&ecirc;'tsEn went away to Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP>'s canoe, and upset it on the water. "Indeed, you have no real supernatural power, friend," thus he said while upsetting Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP>'s canoe.</P>
<P>Xat&ecirc;'tsEn waited in vain for Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> to show himself, but Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> just did mischief to Xat&ecirc;'tsEn's land. Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> transformed into stone a beaver that was sitting by the river. Then Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> caught sight of the watchman at the salmon-weir of Xat&ecirc;'tsEn. He transformed into stone him and his pole. Then he also transformed into stone the watchman of Xat&ecirc;'tsEn. Then Xat&ecirc;'tsEn was vanquished by Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP>, for Xat&ecirc;'tsEn did not know what Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;q&ecirc;?lak<SUP>u</SUP> was doing.</P>
