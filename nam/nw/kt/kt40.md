Q!â'nêqi?la<u>x</u><sup>u</sup> went again, and he saw the Mallard

Q!â'nêqi?la<u>x</u><sup>u</sup> here? It smells like
Q!â'nêqi?la<u>x</u><sup>u</sup>." Then (the roots) were done. Then
Q!â'nêqi?la<u>x</u><sup>u</sup> took them and hid them from one of the

another one. Then he hid them from still another old woman. "Is that the
way you are"--"That is the way we little ones are. We little ones cannot
see."--"Come this way!" Then they went towards
Q!â'nêqi?la<u>x</u><sup>u</sup>, and he took the gum that he had chewed
and spit into their eyes. Then their eyes opened and they saw. "Ah! this
is the light on the face of our world, Lord
Q!â'nêqi?la<u>x</u><sup>u</sup>." That was all. He took the four old
women. Now they could see the light of our world. He took them, and they
flew upward, and they became birds.
