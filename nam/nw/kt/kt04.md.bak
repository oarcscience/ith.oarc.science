# 3. Hamâ'lak\*aua?ê.

Tradition of the A'waiLEla.

(

Dictated by Hai'a~~l~~k\*<u>î</u>n<u>g</u>amê?, a
DEna'x\*da?x<sup>u</sup>, 1897.)

A person living at Having-Humpback-Salmon dreamed. (He said) "Don't stay
thus, children! I have dreamed of the supernatural power that we get
from time to time (we inherit)." Thus he said. He wakened his children.
Then the children arose. He instructed his children, (saying) that he
had dreamed of the place where he always found dead animals on account
of the one-horned mountain-goat, the large mountain-goat, that only
mother of the mountain-goats. (He said,) "Go on, go on, start, children!
Go to our place at K\*â't<u>â</u>lê." K\*â't<u>â</u>lê was the name of
the place where he found dead animals on account of the one-horned
mountain-goat. Then his children went up the river of
Having-Humpback-Salmon. They arrived at the place of their father,
Hamâ'lak\*aua?ê. Hamâ'lak\*aua?ê was the name of their father.

Then the children started. They were four. Four were their dogs, all
hunting-dogs. Then they sat down on the bank of the river. They were
sitting there and looking

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

about over the country. The eldest one of the children saw something
white on a meadow. "What may that be, friends?" said he to his younger
brothers. "Evidently that is what our father referred to. Evidently that
is the thing about which our father gave us instructions." Then it was
shown to the dog. The dog discovered the white thing on the meadow. The
dog went to the meadow. The dog started. The dog reached the white thing
on the meadow, and barked, barking at the white thing on the meadow.
Then the owners of the dog spoke. "Evidently that is what we came here
for." Thus said the children.

The dog came back to his master. Then the dog raised his head to his
master. They say the dog probably knew about the mountain-goat lying
dead on the meadow. Then the brothers started, and the oldest one tried
to get ahead of the others, although the youngest advised his elder
brothers, (saying,) "Don't walk too fast, friends!" Thus said the
youngest one to his elder brothers. Then the youngest one tried to speak
again. "Take heed of the advice of our father!" Thus said the youngest
one. He, the youngest one, alone spoke wisely. The eldest one arrived at
the place where the large one-horned mountain-goat was lying dead on the
meadow. The mountain-goat had a piece of quartz standing on its
forehead. Then the eldest brother desired it overmuch. That eldest one
twisted off the quartz from One-Horn. "Yä," said the youngest one. He,
the youngest one, alone spoke wisely, trying to advise his elder
brothers. Then the elder ones began to skin it. They skinned it quickly.
Only the youngest one warned his elder brothers; but they disobeyed the
instructions of their father, although the father tried to instruct his
children (well).

The elder brothers were quick, and they quickly took off the tallow.
Then they cut open (the mountain-goat)

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

to take off the kidney-fat. The elder brothers tried to get everything;
but the youngest one was just sitting on the meadow, because he felt
badly on account of his elder brothers, who overstepped the advice that
their father had tried to give them in regard to their actions. The
elder ones tried to get all the fat of the intestines of the one-horned
mountain-goat. Then the youngest one spoke. "Be quick before anything
happens, slaves (of misfortune)! Something important is going on above
in the sky." Then a fog appeared above. In vain the elder brothers
fought among themselves for the fat of the intestines, and for all the
kidney-fat, and for the skin of the mountain-goat, In vain they tied it
up quickly. Then they saw the sky. Smoke was rolling down the mountains.
Evidently it was going to snow. Then it began to snow from above.

The youngest one just pinched off a little of the fat of the intestines,
and then he also pinched off a little of the kidney-fat, which he kept
in his mouth,--the youngest one. The youngest one continued to speak
wisely. He followed the instructions of the father to his children, for
the father knew what the ancestors of Hamâ'lak\*aua?ê had been doing.
The youngest one said to his elder brothers, "Make a start, slaves (of
misfortune)." They started again and again (to go back).--Then a very
heavy fall of snow came down. The -snow kept on coming down. The
youngest one did not carry anything, Only the elder brothers carried
much on their backs; but the youngest one just followed the words of his
father, that had been given as advice by the father to his children,
although be had repeated it often when he tried to instruct his
children, and when Hamâ'lak\*aua?ê told them much about his ancestors.

The brothers were all coming down, the youngest one

in the rear. The youngest one just thought that his elder brothers would
be unlucky. In vain the brothers cried, because they were afraid of the
snow. Then the snow reached the top of their feet. Then the snow reached
up to their necks. They just sat down, and they would cry on account of
what might happen. Only the youngest one did not cry in vain. He was
only sad because he had in vain tried to speak wisely to his elder
brothers, because he tried to follow the instructions of his father to
his children.

They were coming (down), and arrived at a gorge on the mountain. A brook
was trickling down there. Their trail led along under the brook, (which
was falling down) from an overhanging cliff, so that the trail led along
under it. Then they sat down by the dripping brook, and they cried, for
what could they do? for the bushes were covered to the top by the snow.
They reached the dripping brook on account of the dogs, for the doors
made a trail for their masters, and the dogs marked (a trail) along the
snow for their masters. They were followed by their masters, (who went)
on the trail of the dogs. Therefore they arrived at the place where they
were going to endure hardships. Then the brothers were just crying on
the rocks, for they could not do anything because their trail was all
ice, for it was really overhanging, the place under which the children
had to go along.

Then the youngest one spoke to his elder brothers. Then he blamed his
elder brothers. "Oh, you who disagree with me!" he said to his elder
brothers, "why did you do that, although our father tried to advise us?"
Thus said the youngest one to his elder brothers. He just scorned his
elder brothers because the elder children were just crying. Then it
occurred to the eldest one to send his dog over the rocks to start along
the trail. There

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

was snow on top of the ice, and there was ice on the trail. The dog
started across. Then an accident happened to the dog of the eldest
brother, and the dog of the eldest brother tumbled down. He dropped into
the gorge, and he was dead. Then the eldest brother cried in vain on
account of what had happened to his dog, who fell down and dropped into
the gorge. Then the dog of the next eldest brother also made an attempt.
The dog of the third brother also walked on it. They just did the same
as the dog of the eldest brother. The dog of the third brother just
dropped into the gorge. Then the dog of the one next to the youngest
tried to walk. He did just the same as the dog of his brother. The dog
of the one next to the youngest had an accident.

Then the eldest one spoke. "Let me try and go along the trail." Thus
said the eldest one to his younger brothers. "Go on, and try!" said the
younger brothers to their elder brother. Then the eldest brother tried
to go across. He walked on the ice, and just the same happened to him as
to the dogs. That man just dropped down into the gorge, to the same
place to which the dogs had dropped. Then his younger brothers cried in
vain. The second one went across on the trail; and just the same thing
happened to him, he dropped into the gorge; and the same thing also
happened to the other one, he just dropped into the gorge. Then the
three men and their dogs were all dead.

The youngest one alone was alive. He sat on the rock and cried on
account of his elder brothers. The boy had half a mind to go on and just
die, together with his dear elder brothers. He was crying. The boy cried
on account of his elder brothers, and the dog, howled. The dog was
crying with his master. Then the boy stopped crying, and directed his
mind to a thing on

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

the rock. The dog, however, almost \[not\] spoke to his master. The dog
would go and nudge his master, who was sitting on the rock, as though
the dog would hurry his master to walk along the rock. After a little
while it stopped snowing.

Then the dog of the youngest one tried to cross on the rock. The dog
held on to the edge of the rock where the ice was at the overhanging
place. The dog went safely across the ice. Then he came back and went
straight to his master and nudged him, as though he were saying to his
master, "Don't stay in this manner!" Then the dog hurried his master.
Then the boy thought that he would listen to his dog, for his dog almost
\[not\] spoke to him. Only he did not understand what the dog said to
his master. Then the boy arose on the rock and lay on the back of his
dog. He held on to the back of his dog, who then went across the ice.
Then he was taken across the ice by his dog. Thus the boy went across,
being carried across by his dog. Then the boy and his dog were safe.

He still held in his mouth the tallow that he had pinched off. Four
pieces were held by him in his mouth. He had only cut off a little from
the skin of the one-horned one. He had just put that skin of the
one-horned mountain-goat in his armpit. Then the dog just put his master
down on the rock, and he just sat down at the place where they had
endured hardships. The dog went on marking the way downward, making a
trail for his master through the snow, and then he returned to his
master every time he had finished making a trail through the snow for
his master. Only (by) doing like this repeatedly did the dog go on,
continuing down his trail through the snow for his master, and coming
back every time, asking his master (to go on). The dog came down,

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

continuing his trail downward through the snow, and in this manner
almost arrived at the river.

Then the boy was tired out. He came to the bank of the river, and the
dog went down the river. His mind was just one with that of the dog; and
the dog was thinking of the village, and he was also thinking of the
man. In this manner he just tried to bring his master home to the house
at a place called Q!awâ'k\*as. There is a fishing-station of the
A'wiLEla at Q!awâ'k\*as; and it was as though the dog spoke to his
master, that the dog thought of bringing his master to the fishing-place
at Q!awâ'k\*as. Then the dog thought that he would swim and carry his
master on his back \[to swim\] down the river \[with his master\], for
the boy was tired out, as the snow covered the tops of the trees, and
the dog was tired out from marking the way through the snow. Therefore
he swam down the river with his master.

They arrived at a house in which a man lived at Q!awâ'k\*as. That was
what the dog had thought of. Then he just put his master down on the
bank, but the boy could not walk well. The dog entered the house.
Probably it had not been long since the owner of the house had gone down
the stream with the current, frightened by the snow. The dog dug in the
fireplace, and just bade his master sit in the hole at the fireplace;
and he buried him and covered him with ashes. Only his mouth showed
after he had buried his master. Thus he tried to warm his master. He
just lay down, coiling himself around his master.

The father wailed for his children because he thought that it had gone
wrong with his children. He \[only\] gave up his children for lost when
he saw the snow coming down; and he already thought that his children
had perished.

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

Now it stopped snowing, after it had \[just\] snowed from morning till
night. For just two days it had been snowing, and the snow reached the
tops of the bushes. Then the father called his tribe and sat down with
his tribe. He asked his tribe what to do. "What shall we do, my dear
ones?" Thus he said to his tribe. "It may be that one of my children has
survived." Then the tribe said that they would go and try to go up the
river of Having-Humpback-Salmon. One of them said, "I wonder what we
shall do! Shall we walk, or shall we go in a canoe?" Thus said one of
the men. "Don't let us do that," said the one who spoke in the house.
"Let us push down four planks. Let us continue to lay them down flat and
put them down endwise, changing their positions. Let us take four and
lay them down flat on the snow."

They tried to pole up the river, but they just gave it up on account of
the snow which was floating on the water. Then the tribe agreed to
change the position of the planks, laying them down flat on the snow,
while they were going up the river of Having-Humpback-Salmon. Then they
put down the planks going up the river towards Q!awâ'k\*as. Then they
arrived at a tributary. Then one man discovered an opening in the snow.
"What may this be?" said the man. "Maybe a wolf," said the man, "which
made this opening as a sign." Thus said the man while they approached
the trail of the dog,--of that dog of the only one of the children of
Hamâ'lak\*aua?ê who was left,--which was the trail that the dog had made
for his master, and that came down the river. The men just went in the
tracks that the dog had made for his master. Then the tribe arrived at
Q!awâ'k\*as, where the only one of the children of Hamâ'lak\*aua?ê that
was left over had stopped. They entered the house, and saw the child
buried in the floor. Then the people

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

cried when they discovered the child, for only its mouth showed. Then
the boy was pulled out by the men. The boy got out of the hole, and they
saw his entire body. His feet were just falling off, for they and his
fingers were frostbitten; and the skin of his whole body came off, for
it was frozen. Therefore the A'wiLEla just cried out of pity for the
boy, for the boy looked ragged because he was frozen,

Then they made up their minds what to do in case they should take the
boy down the river, for he was not well enough to be handled roughly;
for the boy was almost as though there were no life left in him, because
he was frozen. Then the people tried to go down river. They cut two
poles; and four men carried them, one at each end and the boy lay
between them as they were carried at each end by the four men. They
started and went home, walking on the boards, which were joined end to
end.

Then one man, his uncle, spoke, saying that they should leave the boy a
while a little above the village, that the boy should stop there. Then
his father was told that only one of his children was left. Then the
father of the children, Hamâ'lak\*aua?ê, spoke. "Indeed, that is what I
said to my children. Don't let them bring this my child out of the
woods." Then his father made up his mind what to do for the only one of
his children who was still alive. Hamâ'lak\*aua?ê thought that he would
make a winter dance for the only one among his children who was still
alive. The people did not say that one was still alive: they just said
that they were all dead, for they kept it secret on account of what
Hamâ'lak\*aua?ê, had said, because he was just going to show his great
dance, the property of his family. It was to be the wolf-step for his
child. It was to be the great dance from above, that would give his
child supernatural power.

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

Then he cleared his house. Then the A'wiLEla just came stepping like
wolves to the one who was still alive, who had encountered danger in
hunting mountain-goats. Then the A'wiLEla surrounded him; and the great
supernatural one, the great dance from above, came stepping like wolves.
That was the great dance from above of the ancient tribe at
Having-Humpback-Salmon. Then the great dance from above came down to the
beach from the woods, and the dancers entered the house. Many of the
ancestors of the people of Having-Humpback-Salmon, the ancestors of the
Thunder-Birds, danced the supernatural dance. They brought it into the
house, and the great dance from above <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)was just the great supernatural power of
Hamâ'lak\*aua?ê at Having-Humpback-Salmon.

Then he showed what his child had taken from the great mountain-goat,
the one-horned one, the tallow that he had pinched off, and which had
just been kept in the mouth by his child. He put it on the floor of his
house, and showed what had been held in the mouth. Then it increased in
size, and the house of his father was very full. That was the
supernatural treasure obtained from the one-horned one, that was valued,
and that was obtained (found dead) from the large one-horned
mountain-goat. What the boy had just held in his mouth was increasing in
size: therefore that youngest boy was lucky, for he was not foolish, but
had followed the advice of his father; but his elder brothers were dead.

Then his father, Hamâ'lak\*aua?ê, kept inviting (the people) all the
time, for the supernatural treasure of his child had increased in size,
that which his child had had in his mouth, the child of Hamâ'lak\*aua?ê.
Then his father

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

danced. It was the great dance, from above. That was the great dance
from above of the A'wiLEla, who lived at Having-Humpback-Salmon; and
that was the song they sang first. Then they sang. The songs were sung
because he had obtained supernatural power, the one who was endangered
in hunting mountain-goats at Having Humpback-Salmon. Therefore he just
turned into the great dance from above,--he, the only one who remained
alive of those who were endangered in hunting mountain-goats. Therefore
the great dance from above belongs to the great tribe at
Having-Humpback-Salmon, and that came to those who were gathered at
Gwa'dzê?,--those who had a winter dance together at Gwa'dzê?, and they
came to be one when they came to dance the winter dance together at
Gwa'dzê?.

Then Copper-Maker-Face and Pearl-Maker-Face asked Wood-Carver, the
ancestor of the Kwakiutl, the ancestor of the Wood-Carvers, to make a
Showing-Teeth headdress (wolf head-dress) for the great dance from
above. He was the ancestor of the clan K\*!îg\*aê'nox<sup>u</sup>. Now
they continually plaited ropes for leading the dE'nts!êq of the
war-dance. Then Listened-to came and sat behind them when he learned
about what is called "great dance from above" of the ancestors of the
A'wiLEla, when they were dancing the winter dance together at Gwa'dzê?
at the north side of G\*iô'x.

Then the clan sat down, looking among their children (to see) who among
the ancestors of the K\*!îg\*aê'nox<sup>u</sup>, the clan of the
A'wiLEla, should disappear. Then the boy was instructed: "just go into
the water all the time in the lakes in the woods, and always sprinkle
yourself with water. Rub your body with hemlock-branches four times."
Thus the boy was told by his father and uncles. "Just go straight to the
place named Qwa?nêqwâ'la, at the lake above G\*iô'x, above Tâ'yaqôL."

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Then the child went. He would go at once into
the water at the lake that was reached first, and he would rub his body
with hemlock-branches. He followed the advice of his father and his
uncles. He did those actions in which he was instructed by his father
and his uncles. He went on, and arrived at the lake named Qwa?nêqwâ'la.
The name of the lake of G\*iô'x is Qwa?nêqwâ'la. The boy went, and came
to the shore of the lake. He went right into the water and bathed in the
lake. "Evidently this is what my father and uncles referred to," said
the boy. "Evidently this is named Qwa?nêqwâ'la," said the boy. Then the
boy swam to an island in the lake in Qwa?nêqwâ'la. Qwa?nêqwâ'la is the
name of the lake. The nesting-place of all kinds of birds is in this
lake.

Then the boy slept. It was just as though he was unconscious \[asleep\].
Then he heard the sound of paddling. "Hôi, hôi," said the noise of the
paddles. Behold, it was he who is called Warrior-of-the-World. "Wôi,
wôi," said what was heard by the child on the lake, in Qwa?nêqwâ'la.
Then the boy made up his mind. Then the boy sat down on the island in
the lake. The boy just went under water and sat in the water of the
lake. While he was sitting there, he listened for the sound of paddling
that had been heard to come again,--that which said "Wôi, wôi." Soon it
approached the place where he was sitting. It came near. Then he went
under water, and he looked at it from underneath. He sat under water in
the lake. Then he took hold of the canoe of him who is called
Warrior-of-the-World. He nearly \[not\] upset the canoe of him who is
called Warrior-of-the-World. Then the boy put his month out of the water
while he was tipping over the canoe of him who is called
Warrior-of-the-World. One man in the canoe spoke: "What may be the
matter with you?" Thus

said one man among those who are called Warriors-of-the-World. "Don't do
that, my dear!" said another man in the canoe of the
Warriors-of-the-World. Then the boy was just entreated. There was
nothing that was not said to the boy. The one who is called
Warrior-of-the-World was afraid that he might be capsized by the boy.
"Don't do that, my dear! Now I will give you supernatural power." Thus
he was told. Then the boy let go of the canoe of Warrior-of-the-World.
Then Warrior-of-the-World went on, and left the child.

Then the boy went out of the water. The boy just sat down right on the
rock, and felt as though he had to sleep on account of what he had done.
Behold! he was dead. He was taken by Warrior-of-the-World. Evidently he
was given something bad. He was killed by Warrior-of-the-World, whom he
had almost upset. Then the boy was awakened on the rock. "Oh," he was
told, "don't stay thus on the rock!" he was told. Then he uncovered his
face, and he just looked about. He looked around to see who had awakened
him. He did not see any one who had awakened him. Then he bit a hole in
his blanket, and then he discovered a little feather. "What are you
doing on the rock?" he said. "Don't merely handle things roughly. I have
seen you." Thus said the boy.

Then he was invited to enter the house of the one who is called
Cannibal-at-North-End-of-World. Then the house of
Cannibal-at-North-End-of-World opened, and the house of
Cannibal-at-North-End-of-World was open. Behold! that was the house of
Cannibal-at-North-End-of-World where the boy had slept. Behold! that was
the door of Cannibal-at-North-End-of-World where he had slept. Then he
stood on the floor of the house of Cannibal-at-North-End-of-World, and
he was asked, "What does our friend

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

want?" Thus the boy was told when he was standing on the floor. Then the
boy said, "I want to get supernatural power." Thus said the boy. "Go on,
take what you desire!" he was told by Cannibal-at-North-End-of-World. "I
desire to be a cannibal. I shall be a cannibal."--"Go on, sit down!"
Thus the boy was told.

Then Cannibal-at-North-End-of-World took some of his red cedar-bark, and
he for whom it was tried by Cannibal-at-North-End-of-World tried it on.
Then Cannibal-at-North-End-of-World uttered the Cannibal cry and went
around his house. "Watch me!" the boy was told. "That is the way you
will do." And the boy watched the ways of
Cannibal-at-North-End-of-World. Then he finished what had been the
reason of his endeavors. "I do not wish to stay long," said the boy. "I
do not wish to be permeated too much by my supernatural power, else
those who will praise me will be too much afraid of me."--"Wa! \[you
will not be\]!' thus he was told by Cannibal-at-North-End-of-World. "Now
you shall go home to your house." It was only plaited in at the nape of
his neck, what was his Cannibal-pole. Only a small piece of hemlock was
plaited in at the nape of the neck of the boy. The boy came out of the
woods. Then he was expected, and the A'wiLEla tried to catch him in the
great dance from above. Cannibal-at-North-End-of-World came uttering the
Cannibal cry. Behold! they came across dancing the great dance from
above. Then they came across. Then they hauled the rope, and the rope
reached across. The rope went right across. They were pulling the
dE'nts!êk<sup>u</sup>,--the dE'nts!êq of the war dance. Now they were
half across (on the way to) Gwa'dzê?.

They say that Listened-to now wished the sea-monster to show itself,
when Listened-to, the ancestor of the Dzâ'wadEênox<sup>u</sup>, came and
was sitting behind them. "Show

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

yourself, sea-monster!" Thus he said. He wished Q!ê'q!ElsEla to show
itself at Sea-Monster-Place. 'They showed
themselves,--?yâ'x\*?yak\*ili~~l~~, Q!ê'q!ElsEla, Wâ'wixêma,--those whom
Listened-to wished to show themselves. Therefore an accident happened on
the water to the supernatural power, the dance from above, that they
tried to show on the water. Then the rope was cut with which they tried
to lead the dE'nts!êq of the war dance. The dE'nts!êq of the war dance
was rising out of the water. Then it was too much, what they were doing
on the water, and the box containing the wolf-head masks just floated
away. Listened-to, the ancestor of the Dzâ'wadEênox<sup>u</sup>, came
and looked for it, and found the box containing the wolf-head masks at
LôlEla'ts!ê. That is the place to which the box containing the wolf
masks floated. It was just stolen by Listened-to of the
Dzâ'wadEênox<sup>u</sup>. Therefore the ancestors of the
Dzâ'wadEênox<sup>u</sup> have the great dance from above. Listened-to
\[only\] obtained by theft the box containing the wolf masks of those
who danced the winter dance,--the box containing the wolf masks which
had belonged to Pearl-Maker-Face and Copper-Maker-Face. They had been
the owners of the box containing the wolf masks.

 

Now, the cannibal who had obtained as supernatural power
Cannibal-at-North-End-of-World appeared on the beach. Then he devoured a
man. He bolted down a man, although belonging to his own clan. Then it
was difficult to catch him, but he was lassoed, and he was caught. Then
he entered the house, and he was tied in the house. They took off what
was plaited in at the nape of his neck by
Cannibal-at-North-End-of-World,--that little piece of hemlock which was
plaited in at the nape of his neck by Cannibal-at-North-End-of-World.
Behold! that was called the

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Cannibal-pole. Then it was put (up, and reached)
through (the roof of) the house. A
hô'<u>x</u><sup>u</sup>hok<sup>u</sup> was sitting on top of the
Cannibal-pole of Cannibal-at-North-End-of-World, and the body of the
pole was snapping.

Then he was treated by his tribe. He was feared by his tribe because he
was just bolting down the people of his own clan. Therefore his clan was
ridiculed. Vomited was the name of this one Cannibal.
Ku'n?watElag\*ilidzEm was the name of another Cannibal. Then the ropes
with which the Cannibal was tied were broken. He disappeared and did not
come again. Then he had disappeared, he who was the ancestor of the
K\*!î'g\*aênôx<sup>u</sup>, a clan of the A'wiLEla. Hamâ'lak\*aua?ê was
the ancestor of those living at Having-Humpback-Salmon. He brought the
great dance from above to Gwa'dzê?, where the A'wiLEla danced the winter
dance together. That is the end.
