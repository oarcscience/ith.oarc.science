# Mink Marries Frog-Woman

(Dictated by Yâ'<u>g</u>ô<u>L</u>as, a ?nE'm<u>g</u>ês, 1900.)

"Mother!" he said again, "I want very much to marry this
Frog-Woman."--"But won't you get tired of her when she begins to
croak?"--"That is what I like."--"Go on," said Mother. Then he said to
her, "I want to marry you."--"Well, sit down," said Frog-Woman. "Oh, go
on, and begin to croak!"--"Nonsense," said his wife, "these have to
begin croaking first."--"Go on," said again Born-to-be-the-Sun. "Do it
now. Wu<u>g</u>ê', wu<u>g</u>ê'!" said Born-to-be-the-Sun. "Oh, you
little one, keep quiet! This one has to begin croaking first." Then the
first woman began to croak, and then all the frogs began to croak, and
Born-to-be-the-Sun also: Wu<u>g</u>ê', wu<u>g</u>ê', wu<u>g</u>ê'!" Thus
he said. Then there was much noise of croaking. Born-to-be-the-Sun
became tired of the noise. "Stop, now!" he said to his wife. "Oh, you
are a funny fellow." He just became very tired. "Stop!" He just struck
his wife several times in the face. "Were you not forbidden this? No,
indeed! you are the right ones to take a wife from." Thus he said. Then
Born-to-be-the Sun left, and went home to his house. "Where is your

wife'" said Mother. "Oh, I just left her. The little ones made me tired
with their noise." Did I not try to tell you so?"
