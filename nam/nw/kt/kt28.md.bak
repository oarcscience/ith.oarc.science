# X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup>.

Tradition of the Koskimo.

(*Dictated by Yâ'<u>g</u>ô<u>L</u>as, a ?nE'm<u>g</u>ês*, 1900.)

The Koskimo were always killed by the Xô'yalas, and they were only a
few. Then a man went to hide his child when all his other children were
dead. X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup> was the only child of the man. There were
three,--he and his wife and his child. "Make a bird-arrow for me," said
X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup>. Then his father made a bird-arrow for
X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup>, and X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup> shot a wren. He
obtained many (wrens), and they were sewed together for a blanket for
X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup>. Then he started and went to the other side of the
beach to shoot, and he came home carrying a mink. Then he came again
carrying a raccoon; and the next day he came home again, and he had
obtained one mink. Every time the blanket of X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup>
became small. "It is very important, what happens to the blanket of our
child," said the father of X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup>. "Let me go and hide
behind our child."

Then the father of X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup> started. Whenever
X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup> disappeared behind the point, his father would run
to look for him. Then he disappeared again behind the point, and his
father ran to look for his child. Then X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup> was in the
direction towards the sea, and he saw a mink; then the mink went under a
stone. X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup> went from side to side, trying to get the
mink. Then two wolves came. His father only looked on. The wolves took
hold at both ends of the cape, and bit at both ends of the cape of
X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup>. The child did not take notice of the wolves. Then
the mink came out from under the stone, and the mink got away. Then the
wolf ran and bit the mink, and it was dead; and he put it down from his

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

mouth on the beach, and left it. Then the wolves went home, and
X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup> also went home. His cape which had been bitten by
the wolves was small. Then his father ran. "Behold! that is what happens
to our child. Therefore the cape of our child disappears rapidly. Let us
be careful. Behold! something terrible happened to our child."
X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup> came home carrying the mink. Then he was fed and
given to eat. "Now you shall stop shooting," said the father of the
child. They went to sleep. "Let our child be between us in the house."
Then he tied up his house, and they went to sleep. The father held the
child in his arms, and the mother also held the child in her arms. They
watched him during the night.

Then they went to sleep. The father of the child awoke. "Slave," he
said, "stop sleeping!" Thus he said to his wife. "Evidently our child
has been taken away. Evidently something dreadful has happened." Then
the man searched on the floor of his house. There was no hole through
it. He did not know where his child had gone through. Then his wife
cried. "Don't cry, slave! Perhaps our child will become supernatural.
Bear it with fortitude. Don't cry!"

Then X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup> was taken along by the two wolves. He lay on
his stomach on them. They went to a far Country. Then he heard the noise
of people. "Yä," said what was heard. X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup> was told,
"Don't look at it! That is causing potlatch when it is seen." Then they
came to many people who were shouting. They finished. "This is left by
potlatching," said the Wolves. They started. Then he heard laughing.
"Don't look that way, X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup>! This is causing potlatch
when it is seen. That is the laughing-dance." Then is was thrown among
them. They laughed, and rolled about on the ground laughing. Then it was
taken back.

They started. Then they heard shouting. Then they

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

arrived. "Don't look this. way, X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup>! That is causing
potlatch when it is seen. That is the cohabiting dance." Then it was
thrown among them. Then all the men and the women began to cohabit. They
were breathing heavily. Then it was taken back.

Then X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup> started, and they arrived there. "Don't look
that way, X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup>. That is causing potlatch when it is
seen. Those are the Land-Otters." And it was thrown among them; and they
rolled about on the ground with mud on their bodies, and they were
grunting at the same time. Then it was taken back.

Then X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup> started, and they arrived there.
"X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup>, don't look this way! This is causing potlatch
when it is seen. This is the mosquito dance." Then it was thrown among
them, and the men scratched their heads. Then they were very big. Then
it was taken back. Now they were well, and became men.

Then they started, and they arrived at the house of the Wolves. He
(X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup>) was taken into the house of the chief, and he
was taken care of by the Wolves. Then it was asked, "What does our
friend wish?"--"He wants supernatural power."--"This word of our friend
is good."--"He wants a wife from among the daughters of our chief." Then
he said, "Does he not only take the one he likes for his wife?" Then
(the chief) called his children. They sat down, and sat in a row. "Where
is the one desired by our friend? Is it not this eldest one"'--"He does
not want her," said the one who just hears the thoughts of men. Does he
not want this middle one?"--"He does not want her."--"Does he not want
the other one?"--"Not this one, either."--"Does he not want this
youngest one?"--"That is the one desired by him." Then he married her.

"Go on, you shall move and be with her."--"Does he

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

not want this potlatch-pole?"--"He does not want this," said the
Listener, who hears the ways of our thoughts. "Does he not want this
death-bringer?"--"He does not want it."--"Does he not want this water of
life?"--"He does not want it."--"Does he not want this destroying
crazy-making death-bringer?"--"That is desired by him."

They were in the house for a long time. (Then he said,) "I desire to go
now." Then the wife of X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup> told her father about it.
"This my husband feels badly."--"Indeed, he does," said the father of
the child. "Shall he not go?" Then he called his tribe. "This is the
reason I want you to come, for the husband of my child here wishes to
go;--and he shall go, Quick-Spark;--and he shall go,
Quick-Raindrop;--and he shall go, Quick-Stonethrow." Then they said,
"Shall we not start? It does not take a long time when he goes. "We will
go," they said. "We will go around the edges of our world."

Then all the different kinds of wolves came. "Welcome!" said the
father-in-law of X\*â'nElk<sup>u</sup>. "This is the reason why I call
you, that you may go and take our son-in-law out of the woods, and this
death-bringer shall go at the same time. Don't use it often. You may use
it against four tribes. Just blow from time to time when you desire that
they shall sleep whom you wish to take, and against whom you make war.
Now your name shall be Wolf. Now take the death-bringer out of the
woods." Thus Quick-Spark and Quick-Raindrop were told, and he was tied
on the backs of Quick-Spark and Quick-Raindrop.

Then they started, and it was not long before they came back. "We took
time to twist cedar-twigs to tie him with." Then Wolf was taken out of
the woods to his house. He carried his death-bringer, and showed it to
his father. "My supernatural treasure has come! shall

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

we not then strike back at those who killed our tribe, and those who
would have been my brothers?" Then he launched his canoe and went to his
tribe to make war. Then his tribe launched their canoes, and eight
canoes paddled. They were going to make war against the Xô'yalas.

Then they arrived at North-People. Then the death-bringer desired to go
out, wanting to eat North-People. "Don't, my dear!" said Wolf, "that is
our tribe." Then they paddled. Then they came to the
G\*<u>â</u>'p!ênox<sup>u</sup>. Then he desired to go out to eat them.
"Don't, my dear!" said Wolf, "that is our tribe." Thus he said to his
death-bringer. Then they paddled, and came to Cut-Beach. Then he heard
beating of batons. They arrived at night. The Xô'yalas were having a
winter dance. He just stopped in front of the village on the water. Then
he blew on his sleep-bringer. Then they stopped on the water to listen
to the sound of beating time. Very quickly the noise became less. Then
they heard that only two sticks were beating, and now the beating of
time stopped.

Then Wolf arose in his canoe. He sang a sacred song. Then he was silent.
"Later on you shall go out of the canoe, when I have found four \[?\]."
Then Wolf stepped out of his canoe, and saw those who had performed the
winter ceremonial. All those who had performed the winter ceremonial
were asleep. Only the legs of the children were in the cradles. They
held the breasts of their mothers in their mouths. Then Wolf went along
searching in the village. He went to the last house at the end. Then he
began to sing his sacred song, and he found the \[?\]. Then all the men
went out of the canoes to look at those who had performed the winter
ceremonial; and they left them and launched their canoes,

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

taking on board all kinds of food. They carried aboard the men and the
women as slaves, and also his relatives. Then all the men related to him
were on board.

Then many canoes in which were warriors were on the water. Then Wolf
Swung his death-bringer, and the village of the Xô'yalas took fire. They
were all gone. Not one was alive. They were all burned. Then the
warriors went home. They arrived at their house. Their slaves were many.

Then the death-bringer of Wolf was hungry. He engaged his tribe to go to
the place named Having-Olachen to war against the
DEna'x\*da?x<sup>u</sup>, to take from them their land. They launched
their canoes,--eight hunting-canoes,--and they came along paddling. They
came to Dzô'dzad. Then it desired to go out to eat the Seaward-Dwellers.
"Don't, my dear!" said Wolf, "that is our tribe." Thus said Wolf. They
were a long time at Dzô'dzad. The southwest wind continued for ten days
at the south entrance of Dzô'dzad. Then the death-bringer was very
hungry. It was moving all the time. Wolf tried to hold his
death-bringer, but he could not do it. It was too strong. Then his
death-bringer flew away. It came near a mountain and made it burn. Then
he went home feeling badly. His heart was sick. That is the end.
