thunder-bird. The thunder-bird was eating the double-headed serpent.
Q!â'nêqi?la<u>x</u><sup>u</sup> took the back of the double-headed
serpent. He put the back of the serpent on as a belt. He took the eyes

whale. The whale died. Q!â'nêqi?la<u>x</u><sup>u</sup> took the whale
and threw it inland. Then he threw sling-stones at another whale, and
the whale died. Then he threw sling-stones at another whale. He took the

---- at another whale. He took the whale and threw it up shore. Then he
finished. Then he had enough for food for Only-One.
