This is a collection of texts from the Tsimshian, who lived (and
continue to reside) on the northwestern coast of British Columbia. An
earlier (1902) collection of [Tsimshian Texts](../nass/index.md) by Boas,
is also available at Intangible Textual Heritage.

The first three are tales of culture heroes and heroines, far longer
than most texts of this kind. These first three stories, with legendary
quests, mysterious supernatural beings and atmospheric descriptions,
remind one of Icelandic sagas. Following these are a couple of short and
fairly unremarkable animal rivalry stories. The last item is a notable
deluge myth which appears to have very little if any European influence.

Boas' Tsimshian translations have been criticized recently, as has his
relationship with his informants as employer. There is no reason to
believe, however, that these texts are not authentic. Boas was a primary
figure in the dawn of modern anthropology, and the operating procedures
and theory of ethnography were still being worked out at the time.
