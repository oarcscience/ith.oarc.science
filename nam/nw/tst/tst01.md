# INTRODUCTION.

THE following texts in the Tsimshian dialect of the Tsimshian language
were written down by Mr. Henry W. Tate, a full-blood Indian of Port
Simpson, British Columbia, in Tsimshian, with interlinear translation,
according to the alphabet adopted by Bishop Ridley in his Tsimshian
translations of the Gospel (published by The Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge). This material was revised by me, with the
assistance of Mr. Archie Dundas, a full-blood Tsimshian from New
Metlakatla, Alaska. Apparently some slight differences in dialect have
developed between the Tsimshian of the older people who staid in British
Columbia, and the younger generation who migrated to Alaska. The
phonetics, as given here, are those of Archie Dundas.

The following alphabet has been used to represent the sounds of the
Tsimshian.

a short *a* with a strong leaning towards *ê*, which depends largely
upon the following consonant. Before *m*, *n*, *w*, the a is fairly
pure. Before *l*,

~~l~~, *k\**, it is almost *ê*.

â long sound, always pronounced with retracted lips, and therefore more
like ti.

b, *d* distinctly sonant, but more strongly articulated than in English.

E obscure weak *e*, as in *flower*.

ë with glide towards *i*.

g\* distinctly sonant, anterior palatal, with affricative glide towards
*y*, more strongly articulated than English *g*.

g distinctly sonant, middle palatal, like English *g* in *good*, but
more strongly articulated.

**

g the same, velar.

h as in English.

i, *î* continental *i*.

**

î, open *i*, is in *hill*.

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

k\*, *k\*!* surd and fortis of *g\**.

k, *k!* surd and fortis of *g*.

q, *q!* surd and fortis of

<u>g</u>.

l sonant *1*, with full glottal articulation and long continued.

l! the same, with great stress of articulation.

m as in English.

m! the same, with great stress of articulation.

n with fuller glottal articulation than in English.

n! the same, with great stress of articulation.

o, *ô* as in short and long

**

ô like *o* in German *voll*.

**

â like *aw* in *law*.

p, *p!* surd and fortis of *b*.

r a very weak, strongly sonant middle palatal trill.

s the tip of the tongue is turned up and touches the palate just behind
the alveoli. The teeth are closed, and the air escapes laterally. The
sound effect is intermediate between *s* and *sh*.

t, *t!* surd and fortis of *d*.

u, *û* like *oo* in *root*.

w as in English, but more strongly sonant.

w! the same, with greater stress of articulation.

X velar aspirate, like *ch* in German *Bach*.

y as in *year*, but more strongly sonant, with full breath.

y! the same, with greater stress of articulation.

dz, *ts*, *ts!* affricative sonant, surd, and fortis, with purer s sound
than the s described before.

0 indicates parasitic vowels which accompany some short and all long
vowels. These are glottal stops with the weakened timbre of the
preceding vowels. *â*<sup>0</sup>, for instance, sounds almost like äA
(where *A* indicates a very weak *a*),

<u>â</u><sup>0</sup> like *<u>â</u>A*, *i*<sup>0</sup> like *<u>î</u>i*,
*ê*<sup>0</sup> like *êI*. After short vowels, the sound resembles the
simple glottal stop.

\- connects proclitics and stems.

= indicates typographic division.

In the following texts the grammatical forms given by Archie Dundas have
been given preference over those of Mr. Tate, who tends to substitute
the forms peculiar to direct discourse for those characteristic of
indirect discourse. Thus, he writes,--

lukdî'dEt d<u>î</u>~~l~~ lgû'<sup>0</sup>~~l~~gEdit (instead of
lukdî'dagA d<u>î</u>~~l~~ ~~l~~gû'<sup>0</sup>~~l~~gEtga<sup>0</sup>)
she and her daughter were hungry (p. 72, lines I and 2).

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

n<u>â</u>'<sup>0</sup>kE hanâ'<sup>0</sup>x <u>g</u>al<u>g</u>â'lxdEt
dEda nE-wî-la'kdEt (instead of nâ'<sup>0</sup>kE
hanâ'<sup>0</sup>xga<sup>0</sup> a <u>g</u>al<u>gâ</u>'lx gEsgE
nE-wî-la'ktga<sup>0</sup>) the woman lay with her back to the great fire
(p. 72, line 18).

ada ~~l~~at sa<u>g</u>ait-d<u>â</u>'dEt da dEm d<u>ô</u>'xdEt (instead
of ada ~~l~~at sa<u>g</u>ait-d<u>â</u>'ga<sup>0</sup> asgE dEmt
d<u>ô</u>'xtga<sup>0</sup>) then, when she gathered them in order to
take them (p. 74, lines 4 and 5).

It is in accord with this tendency that he omits very often the terminal
-*ga*<sup>0</sup> indicating absence, which Dundas uses regularly. The
same tendency may be observed in the texts dictated to me by Matthias, a
native of Old Metlakatla in 1886, and printed in A. C. von der
Schulenburg's Grammar; <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) while a text
dictated to me by Mrs. Morison, a native of Port Simpson, which may be
found at the same place, <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) does not show
the same tendency. Examples taken from Mr. 'Fate's manuscript are:--

Ada ~~l~~a dEm ksE'rEt (instead of ksE'rEtga<sup>0</sup>) when she went
out (p. 72, line 27). da g\*<u>î</u>k yâ'<sup>0</sup> hanâ'<sup>0</sup>x
(instead of hanâ'xga<sup>0</sup>) then the woman went again (p. 74, line
16).

In other cases Mr. Tate uses the indicative where Dundas prefers the
subjunctive.

gaksta! wâ'<sup>0</sup>gA wî-mExmê'<sup>0</sup> (instead of
<u>g</u>akstat wâ'<sup>0</sup>sgA wî-mExmê'<sup>0</sup>) behold! he
found a large grouse (p. 74, line 13).

wula wâ'lga wula wula-dza'bEdEt (instead of wula wâ'lsga) thus did the
hunters.

He also often omits the possessive *-t* of the third person, and the
demonstrative terminal *-t*.

In the written texts, inaccuracies of construction creep in easily. I
should have [preferred](errata.htm#0.md) a revision of the texts with Mr.
Tate, but this was not feasible.

I published a text with interlinear translation and grammatical notes in
the "Zeitschrift für Ethnologie," 1908, pp. 776-797. A grammatical
sketch of the language is contained in the "Handbook of American
Languages." <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md)
