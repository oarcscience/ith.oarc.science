### 100. MOLDY-END <span id="fr_150"></span>[a](#fn_150.md)

The Sitka, K<u>î</u>ksA'd<u>î</u> have a salmon stream called
Da<u>x</u>ê't and the father of Lively-frog-in-pond went there to camp.
The boy was playing on the beach. Afterward Lively-frog-in-pond caught
sea gulls by means of bait. Then lie was hungry, and went into the
house. He cried for something to eat. He asked for a piece of dry
salmon, and they gave him a piece of dry salmon that was half moldy. He
said, "Why did you give me a piece that is half [moldy](errata.htm#8.md)?"
Then he threw it into the corner of the house. Again he went to pull in
a sea gull. When the sea gull swam out from him he waded out and fell
into a hole. He was nowhere to be seen.

Now his father missed him and said, "Where is my child?" He said this to
his wife. Then they got up. They looked outside. They called to him,
"Lively-frog-in-pond, where are you?" They looked

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

everywhere. They called to everything. Then they went to the place where
he had baited his traps, and saw his tracks leading into the water. They
wept, saying, "What has become of you, my son?" The man waded out,
crying, looking for his son. Then they did not sleep looking for their
son. They hunted everywhere for him. Next morning they went into the
water and along the shore. They had not eaten anything since their son
was lost. They hunted for him all summer. After they had hunted for him
for months they gave up looking.

Lively-frog-in-pond had been captured by the salmon people, however, who
swam out with him. They looked to him like human beings. Then they came
to the salmon people's village with him. He pouted all the time because
he was always hungry. Then the salmon people said, "Let us go with him
to Amusement creek." So they went with him to the creek. They put his
arms around the necks of sand-hill cranes at the creek's mouth.

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

Afterward he was always hungry. But when he began to take some eggs from
among those on the beach, they shouted, "Moldy-end is eating eggs along
the beach of the town," <span id="fr_151"></span>[a](#fn_151.md) and he
felt badly.

Next door to the place where he lived the people were always dancing.
After awhile he looked into the house where they were dancing, and his
face was all over fish eggs. It was the herring people dancing for joy.
One woman called him aside and said to him, "Do you remember when you
said something against the salmon people? That is why they have captured
you." She said to him, "Do you know the creek over there? When you are
hungry roast salmon from it in the fire and eat them there. After you
have eaten, put all your leavings into the water and your roasting
sticks also, in order to wash the leavings off." When he was hungry he
did just the way he had been told. When he was very hungry again he went
to get another salmon. He

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

ate it. Just as he had been told, he put his leavings into the water. He
washed off his roasting stick. That evening, however, the eye of the
salmon people's chief was sore. He cried with it, and did not sleep.
Then the woman said to him, "Do you know where you cooked? Perhaps you
left the eye there." He found it, and when he had obeyed her directions
the eye was cured.

After this the woman said to him, "They are going to start home with
you." Then all of the salmon people started home with him. Afterward,
while the salmon people were swimming along, they spoke of the sît, of
which they were frightened. By and by they came in sight of the sît. It
opened and shut. When the salmon went through it, some of them would be
cut in two. Now they passed through. They saw canoes \[of the herring
people\] coming to meet them. "We have done all of our work before you"
\[said they. They answered\] "When will your cheek-flesh save the person
that eats it?" "Our eggs are our cheek-flesh."

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

Then the salmon gathered together. They said to one another, Where are
you going?" and some said, "We to the Stikine," others, 'To Chilkat,"
others, "To Taku," others, "To Nass," others, "To Alsek." They mentioned
all of these rivers. After that the canoe came to the mouth of the
river. They said, "Stand up in the canoe and see where we are." Then one
stood up in the canoe to look around. The salmon would say, "Is the fort
ready?" and one would go up to look. What they called a fort was a
salmon trap. Every time he came back he said, "It will soon be ready."
By and by he said it was ready. Then the salmon people went thither. The
salmon people entered the creek. They were very happy. The evening after
they went to surround the fort. All the salmon went up in the creek in
two schools. Then his mother, who was cutting down on the beach, saw
Lively-frog-in-pond. He thought he was going to his mother. Then his
mother called to his father to come and spear him. He

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

swam close to her. Then she called out to him again, "A fine salmon is
swimming around here." So his father speared him. He lost consciousness.
Afterward the man said to his wife, "Cut it to use it fresh." But when
she was trying to cut off its head it seemed hard for her to use her
knife, and she saw the copper that had been about her son's neck. Then
she cried out, "This is my little son. He must have been captured by the
salmon people. Here is the copper ring that was around his neck." Now
she took out a mat with feathers inside of it. She laid the mat down and
put the feathers around the salmon. After that she put the mat on top of
the house. In the house, however, they kept singing shamans' songs for
him.

In the middle of the night something shook on top of the house. Looking
at his son, the man saw that he had become a human being about his head.
When he looked at him again, he saw that he had become a human being
still farther down. Then he looked at him

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

again. He was become entirely human. After that they heard a spirit
talking to him. The spirit inside of him said, "I am
Moldy-end-of-salmon. It is I." "It is I," said another spirit inside of
him, "It is I, Sand-hill-crane-at-the-mouth-of-Amusement-creek." Another
spirit in him said, "It is I, Sît spirit." And the woman that had helped
him also became his spirit, saying, "It is I, Woman spirit." Another one
said inside of him, "It is I, Herring spirit." Then another one spoke
inside of him, saying, "It is I, Salmon-people's-canoe spirit, I."

After that his father came to him, and the shaman said, "Clean
everything in the house thoroughly." Again he said, "The young women
must never live in this house but in another." He also said, "Put clean
sand around the fireplace inside. Never let a woman look at me." The
spirit was singing in him. Then he went into a trance,

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

wrapped in a mat. He was brought into the house. There they put eagle
down upon his mouth. He sang in the house, walking around the fire. Then
his spirit asked to have a rattle made for him. He also said an apron
should be made for him. So his rattle was made like the s!ûs!, <span
id="fr_152"></span>[a](#fn_152.md) abut his apron was designed like the
sît. His drum was painted with the sand-hill crane. Afterward his bone
necklace was made of pieces like salmon and herring. Then the spirit
inside of him danced. He saw the salmon very plainly as if they were
people about him. Then he would talk with the salmon people, and he
became a very wonderful shaman. His friends learned to obey him
absolutely. Whatever he foretold came to pass. He told them that there
was going to be a death before it happened. If a person was going to be
saved it happened according to his prediction. If he told them to go
hunting in a canoe and informed them what they were going to get, they
got it.

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

Then he said, "Do not take me to town right away, but in the middle of
winter." They did so. They stayed therewith him. They took him to the
town in the very middle of winter. Then the town people were very
anxious to go out to see him. He said that a fine man would be sick very
soon, and they believed him. So a good man did fall sick, and they paid
him to treat him. Then he became rich. The people of his town said, "Let
whoever is going to look on, fast." All the town people fasted because
they wanted to see what he would do. Then he would act like the salmon,
the herring, the sand-hill crane, and the sît. They were surprised to
see all the things he did. The young women, however, did not look at
him. When be was going to eat, he ate only those things which his spirit
had purified for him, and, when he was going to drink water, the spirit
also made that clean for him. He ate only after his spirit had said,
"You will eat this, my master." He did all things as his spirit directed
him.

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

He did not eat anything fresh. He was not married. Whatever the spirit
told him to, do he did. For that reason he lived a long time. And
although he lived to be very old his head did not become white. This is
all.
