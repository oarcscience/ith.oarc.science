### 19. KÂTS! <span id="fr_30"></span>[a](#fn_30.md)

Kâts! belonged to the Kâ'gwAntân and lived at Sitka. One day he went
hunting with dogs, and, while his dogs ran on after a male bear, this
bear's wife took him into her den, concealed him from her husband, and
married him. He had several children by her. Indoors the bears take off
their skin coats and are just like human beings.

By and by he wanted to go back to his people, but before he started she
told him not to smile at or touch his Indian wife or take up either of
his children. After his return, he would go out for seal, sea lions, and
other animals which he carried up into an inlet where his bear wife was
awaiting him. Then the cubs would come down, pull the canoe ashore
violently, take out the game and throw it from one to another up to
their mother. On account of the roughness of these cubs it came to be a
saying in Sitka, "If you think you are brave, be steersman for Kâts!."

One day Kats! pitied one of his children and took it up. The next time
he went up the inlet, however, the cubs seized him and threw him from
one to another up to their mother, and so killed him. Then they
scattered all over the world and are said to have been killed in various
places.

What is thought to have been the last of these was killed at White Stone
Narrows. When some people were encamped there a girl spoke angrily about
Kâts!'s child, and it came upon them, killing all except a few who
escaped in their canoes, and this woman, whom it carried off alive,
making her groan with pain. One man tried to kill it but did not cut
farther than its hair. Finally all the Indians together killed it with
their spears and knives. <span id="fr_31"></span>[b](#fn_31.md)
