<P>This is the last thing that happened in the Raven story. From this time on everything is about spirits (y&ecirc;k) over and over again. Very few people believed in N&acirc;s-cA'k<U>&icirc;</U>-y&ecirc;l. Most believed in the spirits. From the time that these come into the story you hear little about Raven because people had so much more faith in spirits. You notice that in every Tlingit town in Alaska there are shamans, and years ago, when a shaman died, there was always one right after him, and he was always of the same family. It is through these that the Raven story has been getting less and less.</P>
