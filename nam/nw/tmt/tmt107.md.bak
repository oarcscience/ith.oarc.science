### 83. THE RUNAWAY WIFE

A high-caste youth among the Haida was determined to marry his uncle's
daughter, because his uncle was a very old man and he wanted to take his
place. But, after he had given a great deal of property for the girl and
taken her, she ran away. He followed her and induced her to come back,
but before long she ran away again, and she kept on acting this way for
a long time.

Finally the young man heard of a very large woman who knew of medicines
to get anybody with whom one was in love. When he came to her village
her people treated him very kindly, asking him to come up and eat with
them. After they had fed him and his companions they made a large fire
on top of the retaining timbers for the woman to take her purifying
bath. She had a little girl to

wait upon her when she bathed, and she was so large that this girl could
bathe only one leg at a time.

After she had finished bathing, the large woman came out and gave the
youth an eagle's tail across which ran a single streak of red paint.
Then she said, "Right around the point from your father's village you
will see land otters running up from the water. As soon as the white one
among them steps up on the beach, raise your eagle's tail and see
whether she will stand still. If she stands still and does not run away
go right past without touching her. Then you may know that you will get
your wife and that she will never leave you again; otherwise she will
never come back. When you get to the village, that woman you are having
a hard time with will come directly to you."

The young man did as this woman had told him, and, sure enough, when he
reached the village his wife was very anxious to see him. She tried to
fight against the inclination, but finally she had to go. When she
entered, however, her husband refused to take her back. Instead he went
to another village along with his father and married somebody else. His
first wife took all this hardly, and, when they returned, came to him to
demand property. Then the young man gave heir some of his own and some
of his father's property and some slaves so that she would not bother
his new wife. At the same time the girl felt very badly. Not a day
passed but she cried to think that the husband who had formerly thought
so much of her now had another wife.
