l a spirant belonging to the same series as the preceding; not found in
English though often represented by *thl* or

t, d, n, s, k, g, h, w, y approximate the sounds for which they stand in
English though the agreement is by no means absolute

t!, s!, ts!, tc!, L!, k!, q! are similar to *t*, *s*, *ts*, *tc*, *L*,
*k*, *q*, but are accompanied by a catch in the breath which sometimes
gives the impression of a pause, and sometimes sounds like a sharp click

k\*! when *k!* is pronounced very far forward in the mouth it is
sometimes set off in this way, but the distinction between the two
sounds is by no means clear

Labials are found only in a few words of foreign origin
