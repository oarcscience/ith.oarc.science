### 101. QÂQ!ATCGÛ'K <span id="fr_153"></span>[a](#fn_153.md)

At Sitka were several brothers, the eldest of whom was named
Qâq!Atcgû'k. They were fond of hunting. One morning they went out among
the islands. \[Qâq!Atcgû'k\] killed nothing. Again he went to the place
where he had been in the habit of going. Then his name, was mentioned
among the fur seals. "It is he who is always hunting. Keep quiet, for he
might hear you." Now when they were going shoreward the eldest brother
said, "Pull ahead quickly, for the wind is beginning to blow." Then they
became angry. The bow man laid his paddle down in the canoe. All did the
same. Then they began to cover their heads. The canoe, however, drifted
out. It drifted far out for six days and nights. On the twelfth he awoke
to find the canoe drifting ashore. He saw an island on which were sea
lions, seals, fur seals, sea otters, and sea-lion bristles. All had
drifted on

to the island. Then they took their things up. They stayed there one
year. When a year and a half was completed, the man slept, thinking
about himself.

One morning he awoke with a dream. He dreamed that he had gotten
home. <span id="fr_154"></span>[a](#fn_154.md) And one morning he said to
his younger brothers, "Get up quickly. Let us head the canoe shoreward
at random. The sun always rises from behind Mount Verstovaia." So they
headed shoreward. When it became dark they lowered their anchor into the
sea in the direction of the sunrise, and after they had been out for
many nights they saw a sea gull swimming about. It was really Mount
Edgecumbe that they saw. When they got near to it they saw plainly that
it was Mount Edgecumbe. "Head straight for the mountain," said
Qâq!Atcgû'k, and toward evening they came near it. They named the place
where they came in Canoe-resting-place. There

he pounded out the figure of a sea lion so that people might know he had
come ashore at that place. Then they came to Sitka.

When they arrived in front of this town his old wife was weeping
outside. While she was crying she saw the canoe come in front of the
town. She saw the root hat she herself had woven. She started up, and
went into the house. When they came in below the old woman felt happy.
When her husband came up to her he gave away all sorts of things to the
people-sea-lion whiskers, sea-otter skins, fur-sealskins. He shook
hands <span id="fr_155"></span>[a](#fn_155.md) with his brothers-in-law.
Then they said to him, "This long time the death feast has been held for
you." The young woman, however, was already married. She mourned much
\[to think that she had left her first husband who was now so wealthy\].
