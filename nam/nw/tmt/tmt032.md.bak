### 28. THE YOUTHFUL WARRIOR

A man belonging to the Wolf clan went hunting with his brothers-in-law.
He wore a black bear-skin coat. They went up a certain creek after
grizzly bears, but one time at camp he climbed a tree with his bear skin
on and was filled with arrows by his companions who mistook him for an
animal. Then he said to them, "I will not say that you filled me with
arrows. I will say that I fell from the tree." So, when they got him
home, he said, "I fell from a tree." After he was dead, however, and his
body burned, they found mussel-shell arrow points lying among his bones.

After this his friends told his sister's son to go up to the place where
he had been killed. The name of this place is
Creek-with-a-cliff-at-its-mouth (WAt~~l~~a<u>g</u>ê'L), and it is near
Port Frederick. When the hunters came into camp with a bear the boy
pretended to be asleep, but really he was looking through a hole in his
blanket. While they were cooking the bear some of them suggested that
they say to this boy, "The bear's soup is very sweet," but others did
not wish to. They tried to get the boy to eat some of it, but he would
not. Then they started home with him.

After he had reached home he said to his mother, "Let us go down to the
beach. I want you to look over my hair for lice." But, when she got down
therewith him, he said, "Mother, I want you to tell me truly what my
fathers meant. They said, 'Wake this young fellow up and let him drink
some of this bear's soup.'" Then his mother became frightened and said
to him, "Your uncle went to that creek. They shot him full of arrows
there." When he found that out he chased his mother away.

When he was a few years older he began bathing for strength in
winter-time. After people had whipped each other they would go to the
shaman to see what he predicted. This had been going on for. some time
when four persons went out of the town to carve things for the shaman.
They were gone so long that late in the winter it was thought they had
been lost, and the shaman was consulted. They laid him in the middle of
the house and tested his spirits in every way to find out what the
matter was. Finally, the shaman got his spirits to take a certain man up
to the sky to see if he could discover the missing men. The man he chose
knew that the young man was preparing to kill some one, so, when he
awoke, he said to him, "Tell the shaman that they are there (i. e., in
the heaven to which those go who are killed)." And the youth said to the
people, "The persons who destroyed my uncle are the same who destroyed
these. Let us go to war."

Then they made a war hat for the young man all covered with abalone
shells, and he went out to fight. Every time he went out he conquered,
because he was strong. The missing men, however, got home safely. After
some time the youth came against a fort where lived an old sister of his
father, and this woman shouted down to him during the fight, "I never
thought that that boy would grow into such a powerful man. When I took
away the moss <span id="fr_43"></span>[a](#fn_43.md) from his cradle he
never felt how cold it was." So the young man, when he got into the
fort, inquired, "Who said that to me?" "It was your father's sister who
said it." So he pitied his father's sister, pulled off his war hat, and
smashed it on the rocks in front of her, breaking the abalone shells all
to pieces. He gave up fighting, and they made peace.

Some time after this, however, he killed one of his own friends
belonging to another town, and they came over and killed two of his
people in revenge. After that every time the young man ate, he would
say, "I will leave this good part for my enemy," meaning that he would
feed them on a good war. He always made fun of his enemies because he
was brave. So the people at this place, when they had destroyed all of
his companions, took him captive because he had talked so much. They
would not let him touch the bodies of his friends, and he said to them
at last, "Let me have my friends." "Will you do this any more?" they
said. "No, I will not set out to war any more. Let me have my friends."
Then they lowered a canoe into the water with himself and a few others
who had been preserved, and they started home with the bodies. On the
way one of his companions said to him, "I wish you would steer this
canoe well." "It can not be steered well," he said, "because there are
so few to paddle it." Some of the women belonging to his enemies were in
the canoe along with them. When they burned their dead, they put these

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

women into the fire along with the bodies. Then the man gave up all idea
of fighting. He was the last one left in that clan.

After they had made peace on both sides, a man named Qoxtî'tc came there
from Prince of Wales island on the way to Chilkat. He went to the man
who used to fight so much and said, "How is Chilkat? Is it a town?" He
answered, "It is a notable town. A man has to be careful what he does
there or he will suffer a great shame." Then he started for Klukwan,
which he wanted to see very much. He came in sight of the first village,
Y<u>ê</u>ndê'staq!<u>ê</u>, with many people going around in it, and
said to his wife, "Put on your earring \[of abalone shell\]." The
earring was called Earring-that-can-be-seen-clear-across-the-Nass
(Nâ'skAnAx-dutî'n). Then the, man also put on his leggings and dressed
up finely, for if one were not dressed up just right he would suffer a
great shame. Afterward he began dancing in his canoe. When he came away
from Chilkat he left his dancing clothes with the people but brought
back a great quantity of presents received for dancing.

A very rich man once started from Chilkat to KAq!Anuwû' on a visit with
his wife and all of his property. <span id="fr_44"></span>[a](#fn_44.md)
When they approached the town the people heard his wife singing. She had
a very powerful voice. Then they were frightened and wondered what man
was smart enough to reply to this wealthy visitor. There was a certain
poor man who always sat with his head down, and they kept taunting him,
saying, "Will you speak to that rich man?"

When the visitor came in front of the houses he did not speak to the men
who lived in them but to the dead chiefs who had formerly owned them. No
one replied, for they did not know what to say. After a while, however,
the poor man seized a spear and rushed down to the rich man's canoe.
Then the people shouted, "There goes SAqayê'. He is going to kill this
rich man. Stop him." When he got right in front of the canoe they caught
him, but he said, "I did not want to kill this rich man, but I heard
people talking so much about him that I pretended to." His action had a
sarcastic import, because others were so much afraid of the visitor.

The rich man talked from the canoe for such a long time that they made a
long noise instead of speaking to him, to let him know that he had
talked too long about things that were past. Then they said to him,
"Jump into the water." This was formerly said to a visitor when blankets
were about to be given away for some dead person, though they always
stood ready to catch him. Afterward they took the man up into a house,
placed a Chilkat blanket under him, and gave him five slaves and a canoe
load of property for his dead friend. When he went home they returned
his visit.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[70:a](tmt032.htm#fr_43.md) A Piece of moss was
placed in the cradle for sanitary purposes.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[71:a](tmt032.htm#fr_44.md) There seems to be no
connection between this part of the story and that which goes before
except that both happened at KAq!Anuwû'.
