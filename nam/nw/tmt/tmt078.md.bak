### 54. THE BRANT WIFE <span id="fr_116"></span>[a](#fn_116.md)

A man at <u>G</u>onâ'xo in the ~~L~~axa<u>yî</u>'k (or Yakutat) country
married a brant woman (q<u>ê</u>n). One day in spring this woman said to
her husband, "Let us go outside and watch the flocks of geese passing.
My father's canoe will soon be coming along." Then they went out and saw
a flock of brant coming. The brant seemed to stop over the woman a
little while, and she called to them saying, "Have you anything for me?"
Immediately some dried ts!êt fell upon her lap.

Next day she again said to her husband, "I am sure that my father's
canoe will come along to-day. Let us go outside and sit there." So they
did. Then they saw the largest flock of brant they had yet observed, and
the woman jumped up, saying, "There is my father's canoe coming along."
When the flock got over the place where they were sitting, one of them
made a great noise directly overhead, and her husband thought that must
be his wife's father. His wife also began making the brant noise in
return, so that her husband became very much frightened. As soon as she
had finished she flew up among the brant people.

Now her husband started off under the flock, and ran for a very long
time until he was thoroughly tired out. Seeing that he was now so far
behind that she could barely see him, his wife said to her father,
"Father, let us camp here." So her father had them encamp there on a
flat place, and her husband saw it from a high hill. When he came up
with them, he stood around on the flats and would not go near. By and by
a man came out to him and said, "You better come in. We have a place
prepared for you." So he went in, and found his wife sitting on a mat in
the house with room enough for him beside her. The brants looked to him
just like human beings. Then they cooked for them, and afterward left
the place, taking him with them. When they reached the place where they
were to stay all summer, he saw that they worked very hard to get food
in order to take it back.

Some time afterward the sand-hill cranes (dû~~l~~) and the geese
(t!âwA'k) made war on the brants and killed off many of the latter. At
first the man stood and watched them without taking part, and at last
his wife's father, who was chief of the brants, said to his daughter,

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "Daughter, why is it that your husband will not
help us? Doesn't he see that my people have all been killed? Ask him to
help me." Then the man made war aprons, coats, and hats for the brants
and for himself, and he made himself a club. He killed great numbers of
sand-hill cranes and geese, while none of the brants were destroyed.
After he had killed enough of the enemy to make up for the brants that
had been destroyed, his father-in-law told his daughter to say to-him
that he had killed enough. "If he kills any more," he said, "they will
want to kill more of my people." So all stopped fighting, and they
recommenced collecting food for the return journey. The girl's father
felt very good toward his son-in-law for saving their lives.

When fall came and the brants were ready to start back their chief said,
"We will not go back the same way we came. We must go another way." Then
they started. It seemed to the man that they were going in canoes
instead of flying. Late the first evening the chief said, "Now we will
camp out here." The place that he referred to was a large rock far out
at sea, and they camped upon it. After they had eaten all went to sleep.

Next morning, however, although the man awoke early, he found himself
lying out on the rock alone. Then he was very sad, and did not know what
he should do. He thought, "How am I to get home from here without any
canoe?" He remained out upon that rock for a long time and thought that
he should never see his friends again. He remained there, in fact, all
winter, living on food that the brants had left him. When spring came he
was more anxious than ever to get home, so much so that he did not care
to eat anything and went for several days without nourishment.

One morning he said to himself, "What is the use of getting up?" And he
lay down again with his blankets over his head. After some time had
passed, he heard something say to him very loudly, "Why are you lying
here? What are you doing out here on this rock?" He threw his blanket
off and looked around but saw nothing except a bird called
gus!yadû'~~l~~<u>î</u> sitting near by. He lay down again, and again he
heard the voice. He heard it for the third time. Every time the bird was
sitting in the same place. When he again lay down he thought he must be
crazy, but on keeping a lookout he saw the gus!yadû'~~l~~<u>î</u> run up
toward him very fast, so he said to it quietly, "I have seen you." Then
the bird replied, "I have come to bring you luck. Get on my back and
keep your face buried in the feathers on the back of my neck." When he
had done this, the bird started to fly off with him. It said, "Don't
look up. I do not want you to look up." The farther it went the more it
repeated this warning, so he tried hard to keep his face concealed.
Finally the bird stopped, and he wondered where they were. "You can open
your eyes now,"

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

said the bird, and when he did so he saw that they were on a big pile of
seaweed drifting around far out at sea. Then the bird told him to close
his eyes again, and by the time it stopped with him once more he was
very tired. Then the bird said again, "Now open your eyes." He opened
his eyes and recognized the place well as being close to his own
village.
