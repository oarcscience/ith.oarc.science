### 68. THE BEAVER OF KILLISNOO

Some people belonging to the Dê'citân family captured a small beaver,
and, as it was cunning and very clean, they kept it as a pet. By and by,
however, although it was well cared for, it took offense at something
and began to compose songs. Afterward one of the beaver's masters went
through the woods to a certain salmon creek and found two salmon-spear
handles, beautifully worked, standing at the foot of a big tree. He
carried these home, and, as soon as they were brought into the house,
the beaver said, "That is my make." Then something was said that
offended it again. Upon this the beaver began to sing just like a human
being and surprised the people very much. While it was doing this it
seized a spear and threw it straight through its master's chest, killing
him instantly. Then it threw its tail down upon the ground and the earth
on which that house stood dropped in. They found out afterward that the
beaver had been digging out the earth under the camp so as to make a
great hollow. It is from this story that the Dê'citân claim the beaver
and have the beaver hat. They also have songs composed by the beaver.
