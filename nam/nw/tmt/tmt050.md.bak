Now the people of that town were very much frightened, and none of them
went away. They had heard before that the land otters have death and all
kinds of sickness for their bows and arrows, but until then they had not
believed it. Afterward the people began to starve, and the children
especially suffered very much. One child, who must have been very poor,
would cry at night with hunger. After he had been crying for several
nights in this manner the people saw a torch coming toward the house and
heard the bearer of it say, "Come here, grandchild, and I will feed you
on q!o~~l~~kAdAkê'<u>x</u>." The child did so. This man was named
Man-with-a-burning-hand (Dj<u>î</u>naka<u>x</u>A'dza), because his hand
was always on fire and what he called q!o~~l~~kAdAkê'<u>x</u> were ants
(wAnAtu'x). This happened at TA'qdj<u>î</u>k-ân, the old town of the
Klawak people.

Now the father and mother of this child looked about for it, weeping
continually. As they were passing a certain cliff, they heard a child
crying there, and, raising a flat rock which appeared to cover an
opening, they saw it lying inside. Then they saw that ants were crawling
out of its nose, eyes, and ears. After that many other children were
brought thither, and their parents said to them, "Look at this. Man-with
a-burning-hand did this because the child cried so much. You are always
crying too. This will happen to you some day if you do not stop." Back
of the site of TA'qdj<u>î</u>k-ân there is a cliff still called
Man-with-a-burning-hand. This story was mostly for children, and, when a
child cried too much, they would say, "Do not cry so much or
Man-with-a-burning-hand will get you." The story was known all over
Alaska, and the children were very much afraid of
Man-with-a-burning-hand. <span id="fr_96"></span>[a](tmt051.htm#fn_96.md)
