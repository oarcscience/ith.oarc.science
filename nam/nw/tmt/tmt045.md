One time Raven came to a place called Cold-town and said to the boys
there, "Let us go shooting with bow and arrows." He took down his own
canoe and they started out, but presently the canoe upset and the boys
were all drowned. Then he said to them, "You will stay here." They are
the îkA<u>g</u>â'xe, sea birds whose voices can be heard at a long
distance.
