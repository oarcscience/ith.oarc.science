At that time the woman was pregnant, and presently she gave birth to a
boy. He was very smart like his father, though they did not let him know
who his father was. When he grew larger, he was a fine shot with bow and
arrows, bringing in all sorts of small animals, and the other boys were
jealous of him.

One time, when he was out in a canoe with other boys, hunting, he began
shooting at a cormorant (yûq), which kept going farther and farther out.
All of a sudden it became foggy and they could not see their way, so
they fastened their canoe to the end of a drifting log which was
sticking out of the water, and waited. Then some one came to them and
said to the boy, "I am after you. Your father wants you." At once the
boy lost consciousness, and, when he came to, found himself in a very
fine house on the mainland. The chief living there said, "Do you know
that you are my son?" He also gave him a name, CAmgig<u>ê</u>'tk, and he
thought a great deal of him, but the boy thought it strange that he
never inquired for his mother. Then he gave his son abalone shells and
sharks' teeth (CAxdA'q) as presents. He also made him a club and said to
him, "Whenever you are among wild animals and find there are too many,
put this club down and it will fight for you. When you see seals or sea
lions sitting on the rocks, put it down and it will kill

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

them." After this it seemed to the boy as if a door were opened for him,
and he saw the canoe he had left with the boys in it. They said, "What
happened to you? Where have you been?" But he only answered, "Did not
you see me sitting on the very top of this log?" He was so smart that
they believed him. Then they reached home safe and the grandparents were
very glad to see him, but only his mother knew what had happened. Like
his father, the boy was a great hunter and fisherman. Before he came the
people of that town had been starving, but now, especially since he had
obtained the club, they had plenty to eat. His grandfather's house was
always full of halibut, seal, and sea-lion meat.

Then his grandmother said to him, "Grandson, do not go over in that
direction. None of the village people go there, and those who have done
so never returned." This, however, only made the boy anxious to see what
was the trouble, so he went there and, killing some seals and halibut,
put them into the water to entice the creature up. Finally he saw a
gigantic crab (s!a-u) coming up in the sea, so he put his club into the
ocean, and it broke the crab's shell and killed it. Then he and his
slave pulled the big crab ashore, and he took a load of its flesh home
to his grandparents. His grandparents had worried all the time he was
away, but his mother knew that her son had power over all kinds of fish,
because his father is chief of the sea. Everything in the sea is under
him.

Another time his grandmother said to him, "There is a place over in this
direction where lives a big mussel (yîs!). No canoe can pass it without
being chewed up." So he went to the mussel and killed that. He took all
of its shell home, and the people throughout the village bought it of
him for spears, arrow points, and knives.

At the same time he also brought home a load of cockles, clams, and
other shellfish. In the Tsimshian country the shellfish are fine, and
the mussels are not poisonous as they are here. In April the Alaskans do
not dare to eat shellfish, especially mussels, claiming that they are
poisonous. It is because he killed the big mussel that they are all
poisonous here. Since his time, too, boys and girls have done whatever
their fathers used to do.

After that the boy married and had a son who was very unlike him. His
name was Man-that-eats-the-leavings (Q!a-î't<u>ê</u>-cûka-qâ), and, when
he grew up, he was worthless. He seemed to see the shellfish, however,
and understood the shellfish language.

At the same time the daughter of the chief in a certain village not far
away went out of doors and slipped on slime which had dropped from a
devilfish hung up in front. She said, "Oh! the dirty thing." About the
middle of the following night a fine-looking young man

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

came to her, and she disappeared with him; and the people wondered where
she had gone. This young man was the devilfish, whom she married, and
she had several children by him. Meanwhile, as she was their only child,
her parents were mourning for her continually. After some time had
passed, her parents saw two small devilfishes on the steps of the
chief's house early in the morning, and the people said to the chief,
"What devilfishes are these here on the steps?" He said, "Throw them
down on the beach." They did so, but the little devilfishes came right
back. They threw them down again, but the chief said, "If they come up
the third time, leave them alone. Let them do what they will, but watch
them closely." Then they came right into the chief's house, and one
climbed into the chief's lap while the other got into that of his wife.
He said, "My daughter must have gone to live among the devilfishes." To
see what they would do, he said, "My grandchildren, is this you?" Upon
which they put their tentacles around his neck and began moving about.
Then he gave them some food on long platters, and they acted as though
they were eating from these. Afterward he said, "Take those platters and
follow them along to see where they go." They did so and saw them
disappear under a large rock just in front of the town. So the people
came back and said to the chief, "They went under that large rock down
there. Your daughter must be under there also." When the people got up
next morning they saw on the steps the platters they had taken down,
wiped very clean.

Now the chief felt very badly, for he knew what had happened to his
daughter, so he said to the people in his house, "Go down and invite my
daughter, and say, 'Your father wants you to come to dinner.'" So they
went down and said, "Your father has sent us to invite you, your
children, and your husband to come to dinner at his house." "We are
coming," said the woman from under the beach, "so go back. We will be
there soon." She knew the voices of all of her husband's servants. When
these came back to the chief, he said, "Did you ask her? Did you go
there?" "Yes, we were there." "What did you say to her?" "We told her
just what you wanted us to say to her. She said that her husband, her
children and herself would be here soon."

So the people watched for her, and by and by she came up along with her
devilfish husband and with the two little devilfishes right behind her.
Her marten-skin robe was rotten, all sorts of sea weeds were in her
hair, and she looked badly, although she had formerly been very pretty.
Her father and mother were very sorry. Then they set out food for them
and afterward took the trays down to the place where the little ones had
gone under the rock.

Now the chief invited all of the people into his house, gave them
tobacco to chew, and told them how badly he felt. After they had

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

talked the matter over for a while they said to him, "You might as well
have all the devilfishes killed. When those small ones are grown up you
do not know what they will do to your house." So they invited the
devilfishes again, killed the big one, threw the little ones down on the
beach, and kept the girl. By and by, however, the girl said to her
father, "There is going to be a terrible war. All of the devilfish are
assembling. Don't allow any of the people of your town to sleep at
night. Let them watch." So, when night came on, they could see large and
small devilfishes coming in through every little crack until the house
got quite full of them, and some people were suffocated by having the
devilfishes cover their mouths. The devilfish that they had killed was
chief among them.

Just then Man-that-eats-the-leavings came to that town, and they told
him what a bard time they were having every night with the devilfish, so
he stayed with them until evening. When they came in this time he seemed
to have control over them, and they ceased bothering the people. The
large devilfishes are called dA<u>g</u>asâ'. The small ones, which they
threw down on the beach, are those that the Alaskan Indians see, but
these do not injure anyone now because their grandfather was a human
being.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[129:a](tmt041.htm#fr_88.md) "I have always
wondered what this part of the story means but was never told. It must
have been because we were going to have steamboats. Every now and then
at the present time something happens like things in the stories. The
poor people always had luck in those days, and I have always wondered
what it meant. Years ago, too, we used to hear the old people say,
'There will be no slaves. Those that have been slaves are going to feel
themselves above the real high-caste Indians.' And sure enough nowadays
the people that have come from slaves are very proud, while the race of
nobles is dying out. They are protected by law and know that nothing
harmful can be said to them. We heard of this years ago." (From the
writer's informant.)

<span id="fn_89"></span>[129:b](tmt041.htm#fr_89.md) "Some people are like
this nowadays. They are very poor but are so used to the life that they
can not see it, and so used to filth that they do not notice it." (From
the writer's informant.)
