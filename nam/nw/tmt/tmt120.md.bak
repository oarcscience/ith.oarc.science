### 95. ORIGIN OF THE FROG CREST AMONG THE KÎKSA'D<u>Î</u> <span id="fr_139"></span>[a](#fn_139.md)

A married couple went from Sitka into <u>G</u>aya' bay, and camped at
<u>G</u>A'xgu-ân. They were there for perhaps a month. One morning they
started out hunting. Then they heard a song on <u>G</u>aya' bay. They
listened. They did not hear plainly. \[The man's\] wife said to him, "Do
you hear it?" He said, "I hear the thing making a noise over there."
"Turn toward it," they said. They went toward it and saw it. It was a
little frog which the man let float down to his wife in the stern. He
said, "It is for you." So they brought it to Sitka. This is how the
little frog's song came to be known, and this is why the KîksA'd<u>î</u>
claim the frog.
