### 14. THE PROTRACTED WINTER

One time some boys pulled a piece of drifting seaweed out of the water
on one side of their canoe and put it in again on the other. It was
almost summer then, but, for having done this, winter came on again and
snow was piled high in front of the houses so that people began to be in
want of food. One day, however, a blue jay perched on the edge of a
smoke hole, with elderberries in its mouth, and cried, "Kî~~l~~nA'xe."
This was the name of a neighboring town. So the people took all the
cedar bark they had prepared to make houses out of and went to
Kî~~l~~nA'xe where they found that it was already summer and the berries
were ripe. Only about their own town was it still winter. This happened
just beyond the town of Wrangell.

I tell you this story to show how particular people used to be in olden
times about things, for it was only a piece of seaweed that brought
winter on.
