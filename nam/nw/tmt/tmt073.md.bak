### 49. ROOTS <span id="fr_113"></span>[a](#fn_113.md)

A boy was walking along in front of the houses of a very populous
village early one morning when a quill fell right in front of him. The
boy picked it up and started to run away, but it lifted him up into the
air out of sight. After that several other people were missed, and no
one knew what had become of them. Finally, however, they saw another
going up very rapidly, and so discovered what was the matter. Now, the
people watched very closely, and, when another was seen to be taken up,
a man seized him by the legs. He, however, was also lifted into the air.
Then another grasped him, and all of the people of the village kept on
doing this, thinking to break the

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

string, until no one was left in that town except a woman and her
daughter. These two lived at one end and refused to touch the others.

The mother of this girt was very fond of making spruce-root baskets,
and, when she went after roots, the girl always accompanied her. When
her mother cut off the ends of the roots out in the forest her daughter
would chew them because they were sweet, and swallow the juice, after
which she would spit them out and take more. Finally she got so used to
chewing them that she would chew up fine the roots themselves and
swallow them.

Now, after this had gone on for some time, the girl saw that she was
growing large, and presently she gave birth to a boy baby. While this
child was still very small she bathed him in cold water to make him
strong, and he grew very fast.

When he was partially grown he one day saw the quill which had carried
away the people, picked it up and pulled on it very hard. Then he
noticed that someone was pulling it up. This invisible person tried to
pull him up also, but he was very strong and ran out roots into the
ground in every direction so that he could not be moved. All that he
could see was the quill. He tried hard to find a line fastened to it,
but there was nothing visible except the quill pulling up and down. He
determined to hold on, however, to see what would happen, and at last he
felt something break and the quill come away in his hands.

While Roots continued sitting in the same place a boy came to him
saying, "Where is that quill of mine? Give it to me." Then Roots
answered, "Well! where are my village people? Give them to me." "Give me
the quill first," said the boy. "No, give me back my village people
first, and I will give you the quill." Then he begged very hard for his
village people, and the boy begged very hard for the quill, until at
last Roots heard the noise of people coming. At that he handed back the
quill and the boy vanished.

The people did not come that day, however, and Roots was uneasy, feeling
that he had been very foolish to give the quill back before his friends
had returned. Next morning early, however, he heard a great noise as of
people moving about, and he jumped out of bed to look. The houses
throughout the village were filled with their former occupants, who had
come back during the night. All were very glad to get back after their
long absence, for where they had been they seemed to have suffered. All
complained of the mean master that they had had, but they could not tell
whether they had been made slaves or not. All were very good to Roots
for having restored them.

Afterward Roots, the full form of whose name is Root-ends (XAt
cugû'Lk!<u>î</u>), was known everywhere, and all of the strong people
would go to his village to test him. Among them went a strong rock,
called Itc!, who felt that he was very powerful. When they began to

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

contend, Roots jumped upon Itc! first but could not move him. Then Roots
looked at his antagonist and saw that he was half buried in the ground
although a human being. This made Roots angry and he stooped down,
picked Itc! up, and threw him down headlong. After he had done so he
looked and lo! there lay only a rock. If it had not been for the numbers
of roots that Roots sent out, however, Itc! would have beaten him.
