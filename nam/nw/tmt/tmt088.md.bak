### 64. THE MAN WHO ENTERTAINED THE BEARS <span id="fr_119"></span>[b](#fn_119.md)

A man belonging to the Raven clan living in a very large town had lost
all of his friends, and he felt sad to think that he was left alone. He
began to consider how he could leave that place without undergoing
hardships. First he thought of paddling away, but he said to himself,
"If I paddle away to another village and the people there see that I am
alone, they may think that I have run away from my own village, from
having been accused of witchcraft or on account of some

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

other disgraceful thing." He did not feel like killing himself, so he
thought that he would go off into the forest.

While this man was traveling along in the woods the thought occurred to
him to go to the bears and let the bears kill him. The village was at
the mouth of a large salmon creek, so he went over to that early in the
morning until he found a bear trail and lay down across the end of it.
He thought that when the bears came out along this trail they would find
and kill him.

By and by, as he lay there, he heard the bushes breaking and saw a large
number of grizzly bears coming along. The largest bear led, and the tips
of his hairs were white. Then the man became frightened. He did not want
to die a hard death and imagined himself being torn to pieces among the
bears. So, when the leading bear came up to him, he said to it, "I have
come to invite you to a feast." At that the bear's fur stood straight
up, and the man thought that it was all over with him, but he spoke
again saying, "I have come to invite you to a feast, but, if you are
going to kill me, I am willing to die. I am alone. I have lost all of my
property, my children, and my wife."

As soon as he had said this the leading bear turned about and whined to
the bears that were following. Then he started back and the rest
followed him. Afterward the man got up and walked toward his village
very fast. He imagined that the biggest bear had told his people to go
back because they were invited to a feast.

When he got home he began to clean up. The old sand around the fireplace
he took away and replaced with clean sand. Then he went for a load of
wood. When he told the other people in that village, however, they were
all very much frightened, and said to him, "What made you do such a
thing?" After that the man took off his shirt, and painted himself up,
putting stripes of red across his upper arm muscles, a stripe over his
heart, and another across the upper part of his chest.

Very early in the morning, after he had thus prepared, he stood outside
of the door looking for them. Finally he saw them at the mouth of the
creek, coming along with the same big bear in front. When the other
village people saw them, however, they were so terrified that they shut
themselves in their houses, but he stood still to receive them. Then he
brought them into the house and gave them seats, placing the chief in
the middle at the rear of the house and the rest around him. First he
served them large trays of cranberries preserved in grease. The large
bear seemed to say something to his companions, and as soon as he began
to eat the rest started. They watched him and did whatever he did. The
host followed that up with other kinds of food, and, after they were
through, the large bear seemed to talk to him for a very long time. The
man thought that

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

he was delivering a speech, for he would look up at the smoke hole every
now and then and act as though talking. When he finished he started out
and the rest followed. As they went out each in turn licked the paint
from their host's arm and breast.

The day after all this happened the smallest bear came back, as it
appeared to the man, in human form, and spoke to him in Tlingit. He had
been a human being who was captured and adopted by the bears. This
person asked the man if he understood their chief, and he said, "No."
"He was telling you," the bear replied, "that he is in the same
condition as you. He has lost all of his friends. He had heard of you
before he saw you. He told you to think of him when you are mourning for
your lost ones."

When the man asked this person why he had not told him what was said the
day before, he replied that he was not allowed to speak his native
language while the chief was around. It was on account of this adventure
that the old people, when they killed a grizzly bear, would paint a
cross on its skin. Also, when they gave a feast, no matter if a person
were their enemy, they would invite him and become friends just as this
man did to the bears, which are yet great foes to man.
