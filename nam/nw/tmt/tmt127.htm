<P>A canoe [load of people] came behind the sea lions at Cape Ommaney. And they camped behind them. In the morning they went out to the sea-lion island. They sharpened limbs on the ends to make the sea lions sneeze and pushed them into their noses. In that way they killed off all the sea lions.</P>
