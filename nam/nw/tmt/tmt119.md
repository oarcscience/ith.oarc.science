A man at Auk went out on the lake after firewood. On the way round it be
saw a woman floating about. Her hair was long. Looking at her for some
time, he saw that her little ones were with her. He took one of the
children home. When it became dark they went to sleep. It was the child
of the L!<u>ê</u>'nAx<u>x</u>î'dAq, and that night it went through the
town picking out people's eyes. Toward morning a certain woman bore a
child. In the morning, when she was getting up, this \[the
L!<u>ê</u>'nAx<u>x</u>î'dAq's child\] came into her into the house. The
small boy had a big belly full of eyes. He had taken out the eyes of all
the people. That woman to whom the small boy came had a cane. He kept
pointing at her eyes. Then she pushed him away with the cane. When he
had done it twice, she pushed it into him. He was all full of eyes.
After she had killed him the woman went through the

houses. Then she began to dress herself up. She took her child up on her
back to start wandering., She said, "I am going to be the
L!<u>ê</u>'nAx<u>x</u>î'dAq." When she came down on the beach she kept
eating mussels. She put the shells inside of one another. As she walks
along she nurses her little child.
