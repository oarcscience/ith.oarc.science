### 84. THE REJECTED LOVER

Somewhere to the north lived a chief who had a daughter and a nephew who
was in love with this daughter. In olden times when a man married a
woman with a marriageable daughter he married the daughter as well, so
the youth wanted to marry this chief's wife in order to get her
daughter. The boy's father was chief of a certain clan. When he found
that he could not get this woman by himself the young man told his
mother, and his mother worked hard for him. They carried in slaves and
goods of all kinds to the chief. Still the chief would not consent, for
he wanted his daughter to marry some great chief from outside. He would
not let anyone in the village have her. It was really the girl, however,
that had induced her father not to give his consent. She must have been
in love with somebody else or her father would not have spoken in that
way.

The boy's father had him ornamented with abalone shell, in his ears and
all over his shirt, but, just as soon as he came in decorated in this
way, along with his mother, the girl would jump up, raise her marten
robe in front of her face, run to meet them before, they sat down and
say to him, "You may be decorated with all kinds of valuable shells, but
I will not have you." The boy and her mother were

hurt at this. At first the girl liked her cousin well enough, but, when
she found that he had made hard feelings between her parents, she began
to feel unkindly toward him. Probably her father hated the boy because
his wife was willing to marry him.

One day the girl felt lonely and asked her cousin to go up with her to
get spruce bark to eat. The girl took along her little servant girl and
the boy his little servant boy. So they went up back of the town until
they came to a place where there were only spruces with open grassy
spots between. The girl sat down on one of these latter and her cousin
took the bark off for her. He was very good to her, and tried to humor
her in every way, but by and by she said to him, "Pull off your marten
robe and put it into that pond close by." The boy did so, saying, "Did
you think I could not do that? I have plenty of marten robes." Then the
girl spoke again saying, "Pull off all of your hair." He began to do so,
and, when it was all pulled out, she said, "All right." Then she said,
"Take all those shells from your ears and face and throw them away." The
boy began to feel disturbed (lit. strange) about what she was saying to
him, but he did so. As soon as he had finished, however, the girl and
her servant ran home.

Now the boy did not dare to return, because he had nothing to wear, his
marten robe being wet and his shells lost in the grass. So he took some
moss wide enough to cover his shoulders and body and lay down upon a
point at the edge of the woods. He felt very badly and cried hard as he
lay there. When he looked up he saw a loon swimming about in the sea. By
and by he looked up again and he again saw the loon in the same place.
Every now and then it uttered a cry. Finally, as he was lying with his
head down, he heard some one say to him, "I have come after you." He
looked up again but saw nothing except that loon. The fourth time this
happened he kept watch, for he thought that it was the loon, and he saw
a man coming to him. Before this person, who was in fact the loon, could
say anything the boy exclaimed, "I have seen you." Then the loon said,
"Come along with me. Get on my back and shut your eyes tight."

Then the man did as this loon directed, and the latter dived down into
the sea with him and came up quite a distance out. "Look up," it said.
The youth did so and found himself some distance out on the water. The
hair was growing again upon his head. Then the loon told him to close
his eyes a second time, went out still farther, and told him to reopen
them. He was out a very long distance. Then the boy thought, "What is he
taking me out here for?" When he opened his eyes for the third time he
could see a village, and the loon said to him, "You see that village.
The chief there has a lovely daughter whom you, are to marry." After he
had come up to the shore with him he, showed him this chief's house and
said, "You are

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

to marry the daughter of the chief who owns that house." Then the loon
handed him the shells for his ears and his marten robe, which looked as
nice as ever.

At night the youth went to the chief's house, passed in to where his
daughter was, and said, "Chief's daughter, I have been told that I am
not good enough to marry you." But the girl liked him very much and
married him at once.

When news came to this girl's father, who was the Calm, that his child
was married, he did not say anything, for she had been brought up very
well, and she was to marry whomsoever she pleased.

So the man stayed there very many years, but at last he wanted to return
to his father's people. The chief took down his own canoe for his
daughter and son-in-law, and they put all kinds of food into it. The
people disliked to see them go, and the chief told his daughter to be
good to her husband. The canoe that they had was a bear canoe, and
everywhere they camped they had to take very good care of it. Before
they set out the chief said to his daughter, "Don't let anybody whatever
give you water. Let your husband always bring it and give it to you. He
gave her a quill to drink water out of and a very small basket for her
cup. Then the girl said to her husband, "You must let alone those girls
you used to go with and those you were in love with. You are not to
speak to them."

When they came to his father's town all were glad to see the youth, for
they had been looking for him everywhere. While they were there he
always brought the water for his wife to drink as he had been told. One
day, however, as he was going for water, his former sweetheart, who was
angry with him because he would follow his wife around and pay no
attention to her, ran through the woods to him, seized him and spoke to
him. He, however, pulled himself away and would not answer her. When the
girl put her quill into the water this time, however, the water was
slimy. Before it had been pure and would drip like raindrops. At once
she said, "I must leave you," and, although he begged her hard to stay,
she got up and walked out. He tried to stop her but in vain. Every time
he seized her his hands passed right through her. Then she began walking
right out on the surface of the sea and he followed her. She said "Go
back," but he kept on until they were a long distance out. Then she
said, "Go back or I will look at you." So she turned around and looked
at him, and he went straight down into the ocean.
