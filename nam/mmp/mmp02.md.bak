# PREFACE

IN recent years a reawakening has taken place in the study of American
archæology and antiquities, owing chiefly to the labours of a band of
scholars in the United States and a few enthusiasts in the continent of
Europe. For the greater part of the nineteenth century it appeared as if
the last word had been written upon Mexican archæology. The lack of
excavations and exploration had cramped the outlook of scholars, and
there was nothing for them to work upon save what had been done in this
respect before their own time. The writers on Central America who lived
in the third quarter of the last century relied on the travels of
Stephens and Norman, and never appeared to consider it essential that
the country or the antiquities in which they specialised should be
examined anew, or that fresh expeditions should be equipped to discover
whether still further monuments existed relating to the ancient peoples
who raised the teocallis of Mexico and the huacas of Peru. True, the
middle of the century was not altogether without its Americanist
explorers, but the researches of these were performed in a manner so
perfunctory that but few additions to the science resulted from their
labours.

Modern Americanist archaeology may be said to have been the creation of
a brilliant band of scholars who, working far apart and without any
attempt at co-operation, yet succeeded in accomplishing much. Among
these may be mentioned the Frenchmen Charnay and de Rosny, and the
Americans Brinton, H. H. Bancroft, and Squier. To these succeeded the
German scholars Seler, Schellhas, and Förstemann, the Americans Winsor,
Starr, Savile, and Cyrus Thomas, and the Englishmen Payne and Sir
Clements Markham. These men, splendidly equipped for the work they had
taken in hand, were yet hampered by the lack of reliable data -a want
later supplied partly by their own excavations and partly by the
painstaking labours of Professor Maudslay, principal of the
International College of Antiquities at Mexico, who, with his wife, is
responsible or the exact pictorial reproductions of many of the ancient
edifices in Central America and Mexico.

Writers in the sphere of Mexican and Peruvian myth have been few. The
first to attack the subject in the light of the modern science of
comparative religion was Daniel Garrison Brinton, professor of American
languages and archaeology in the University of Philadelphia. He has been
followed by Payne, Schellhas, Seler, and Rrstemann, all of whom,
however, have confined the publication of their researches to isolated
articles in various geographical and scientific journals. The remarks of
mythologists who are not also Americanists upon the subject of American
myth must be accepted with caution.

The question of the alphabets of ancient America is perhaps the most
acute in present-day pre-Columbian archaeology. But progress is being
made in this branch of the subject, and several scholars are working in
whole-hearted co-operation to secure final results.

What has Great Britain accomplished in this new and fascinating field of
science? If the lifelong and valuable labours of the late Sir Clements
Markham be excepted, almost nothing. It is earnestly hoped that the
publication of this volume may prove the means of leading many English
students to the study and consideration of American archaeology.

There remains the romance of old America. The real interest of American
mediaeval history must ever circle around Mexico and Peru-her golden
empires, her sole exemplars of civilisation; and it is to the books upon
the character of these two nations that we must turn for a romantic
interest as curious and as absorbing as that bound up in the history of
Egypt or Assyria.

If human interest is craved for by any man, let him turn to the
narratives of Garcilasso el Inca de la Vega and Ixtlilxochitl,
representatives and last descendants of the Peruvian and Tezcucan
monarchies, and read there the frightful story of the path to fortune of
red-heeled Pizarro and cruel Cortés, of the horrible cruelties committed
upon the red man, whose colour was "that of the devil," of the awful
pageant of fold-sated pirates laden with the treasures of palaces, of
the stripping of temples whose very bricks were of gold, whose very
drain-pipes were of silver, of rapine and the sacrilege of high places,
of porphyry gods dashed down the pyramidal sides of lofty teocallis, of
princesses tom from the very steps of the throne-ay, read these for the
most wondrous tales ever writ by the hand of man, tales by the side of
which the fables of Araby seem dim -the story of a clash of worlds, the
conquest of a new, of an isolated hemisphere.

It is usual to speak of America as "a continent without a history." The
folly of such a statement is extreme. For centuries prior to European
occupation Central America was the seat of civilisations boasting a
history and a semi-historical mythology second to none in richness and
interest. It is only because the sources of that history are unknown to
the general reader that such assurance upon the lack of it exists.

Let us hope that this book may assist in attracting many to the
head-fountain of a river whose affluents water many a plain of beauty
not the less lovely because bizarre, not the less fascinating because
somewhat remote from modern thought.

In conclusion I have to acknowledge the courtesy of the Bureau of
American Ethnology, which placed in my hands a valuable collection of
illustrations and allowed me to select from these at my discretion. The
pictures chosen include the drawings used as tailpieces to chapters;
others, usually half-tones, are duly acknowledged where they occur.
