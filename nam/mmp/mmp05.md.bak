# CHAPTER II: Mexican Mythology

## Nahua Religion

THE religion of the ancient Mexicans was a polytheism or worship of a
pantheon of deities, the general aspect of which presented similarities
to the systems of Greece and Egypt. Original influences, however, were
strong, and they are especially discernible in the institutions of
ritualistic cannibalism and human sacrifice. Strange resemblances to
Christian practice were observed in the Aztec mythology by the Spanish
Conquistadores, who piously condemned the native customs of baptism,
consubstantiation, and confession as frauds founded and perpetuated by
diabolic agency.

A superficial examination of the Nahua religion might lead to the
inference that within its scope and system no definite theological views
were embraced and no ethical principles propounded, and that the entire
mythology presents only the fantastic attitude of the barbarian mind
toward the eternal verities. Such a conclusion would be both erroneous
and unjust to a human intelligence of a type by no means debased. As a
matter of fact, the Nahua displayed a theological advancement greatly
superior to that of the Greeks or Romans, and quite on a level with that
expressed by the Egyptians and Assyrians. Toward the period or the
Spanish occupation the Mexican priesthood was undoubtedly advancing to
the contemplation of the exaltation of one god, whose worship was fast
excluding that of similar deities, and if our data are too imperfect to
allow us to speak very fully in regard to this phase of religious
advancement, we know at least that much of the Nahua ritual and many of
the prayers preserved by the labours of the Spanish fathers are
unquestionably genuine, and display the attainment of a high religious
level.

## Cosmology

Aztec theology postulated an eternity which, however, was not without
its epochs. It was thought to be broken up into a number of aeons, each
of which depended upon the period of duration of a separate "sun." No
agreement is noticeable among authorities on Mexican mythology as to the
number of these "suns," but it would appear as probable that the
favourite tradition stipulated for four "suns " or epochs, each of which
concluded with a national disaster-flood, famine, tempest, or fire. The
present veon, they feared, might conclude upon the completion of every "
sheaf " of fifty-two years, the " sheaf " being a merely arbitrary
portion of an veon. The period of time from the first creation to the
current aeon was variously computed as 15,228, 2386, or 1404 solar
years, the discrepancy and doubt arising because of the equivocal nature
of the numeral signs expressing the period in the pinturas or native
paintings. As regards the sequence of "suns" there is no more agreement
than there is regarding their number. The Codex Vaticanus states it to
have been water, wind, fire, and famine. Humboldt gives it as hunger,
fire, wind, and water; Boturini as water, famine, wind, and fire; and
Gama as hunger, wind, fire, and water.

In all likelihood the adoption of tour ages arose from the sacred nature
of that number. The myth doubtless shaped itself upon the *tonalamatl*
(Mexican native calendar), the great repository of the wisdom of the
Nahua race, which the priestly class regarded as its vade mecum, and
which was closely consulted by it on every occasion. civil or religious.

## The Sources of Mexican Mythology

Our knowledge of the mythology of the Mexicans is chiefly gained through
the works of those Spaniards, lay and cleric, who entered the country
along with or immediately subsequent to the Spanish Conquistadores. From
several of these we have what might be called first-hand accounts of the
theogony and ritual of the Nahua people. The most valuable compendium is
that of Father Bernardino Sahagun, entitled *A General History of the
Afairs of New Spain*, which was published from manuscript only in the
middle of last century, though written in the first half of the
sixteenth century. Sahagun arrived in Mexico eight years after the
country had been reduced by the Spaniards to a condition of servitude.
He obtained a thorough mastery of the Nahuatl tongue, and conceived a
warm admiration for the native mind and a deep interest in the
antiquities of the conquered people. His method of collecting facts
concerning their mythology and history was as effective as it was
ingenious. He held daily conferences with reliable Indians, and placed
questions before them, to which they replied by symbolical paintings
detailing the answers which he required. These he submitted to scholars
who had been trained under his own supervision, and who, after
consultation among), themselves, rendered him a criticism in Nahuatl of
the hieroglyphical paintings he had placed at their disposal. Not
content with this process, he subjected these replies to the criticism
of a third body, after which the matter was included in his work. But
ecclesiastical intolerance was destined to keep the work from
publication for a couple of centuries. Afraid that such a volume would
be successful in keeping alight the fires of paganism in Mexico,
Sahagun's brethren refused him the assistance he required for its
publication. But on his appealing to the Council of the Indies in Spain
he was met with encouragement, and was ordered to translate his great
work into Spanish, a task he undertook when over eighty years of age. He
transmitted the work to Spain, and for three hundred years nothing more
was heard of it.

## The Romance of the Lost "Sahagun"

For generations antiquarians interested in the lore or ancient Mexico
bemoaned its loss, until at length one Mufloz, more indefatigable than
the rest, chanced to visit the crumbling library of the ancient convent
of Tolosi, in Navarre. There, among time-worn manuscripts and tomes
relating to the early fathers and the intricacies of canon law, he
discovered the lost Sahagun! It was printed separately by Bustamante at
Mexico and by Lord Kingsborough in his collection in 1830, and has been
translated into French by M. Jourdanet. Thus the manuscript commenced in
or after 1530 was given to the public after a lapse of no less than
three hundred years!

## Torquemada

Father Torquemada arrived in the New World about the middle of the
sixteenth century, at which period he was still enabled to take from the
lips of such of the Conquistadores as remained much curious information
regarding the circumstances of their advent. His *Monarchia Indiana* was
first published at Seville in 1615, and in it he made much use of the
manuscript of Sahagun, not then published. At the same time his
observations upon matters pertaining to the native religion are often
illuminating and exhaustive.

In his *Storia Antica del Messico* the Abbé Clavigero, who published his
work in 1780, did much to disperse the clouds of tradition which hung
over Mexican history and mythology. The clarity of his style and the
exactness of his information render his work exceedingly useful.

Antonio Gama, in his *Descripcion Historica y Cronologica de las dos
Piedras*, poured a flood of light on Mexican antiquities. His work was
published in 1832. With him maybe said to have ceased the line of
Mexican archxologists of the older school. Others worthy of being
mentioned among the older writers on Mexican mythology (we are not here
concerned with history) are Boturini, who, in his *Idea de una Nueva
Historia General de la America Septentrional*, gives a vivid picture of
native life and tradition, culled from first-hand communication with the
people; Ixdilxochitl, a half-breed, whose mendacious works, the
Relaciones and Historia Chichimeca, are yet valuable repositories of
tradition; José de Acosta, whose *Historia Natural y Moral de las
Yndias* was published at Seville in 1580; and Gomara, who, in his
*Historia General de las Indias* (Madrid, 1749), rested upon the
authority of the Conquistadores. Tezozomoc's *Chronica Mexicana*,
reproduced in Lord Kingsborough's great work, is valuable as giving
unique facts regarding the Aztec mythology, as is the *Teatro Mexicana*
of Vetancurt, published at Mexico in 1697-98.

## The Worship of One God

The ritual of this dead faith of another hemisphere abounds in
expressions concerning the unity of the deity approaching very nearly to
many of those we ourselves employ regarding God's attributes. The
various classes of the priesthood were in the habit of addressing the
several gods to whom they ministered as "omnipotent," "endless,"
"invisible," "the one god complete in perfection and unity," and "the
Maker and Moulder of All." These appellations they applied not to one
supreme being, but to the individual deities to whose service they were
attached. It may be thought that such a practice would be fatal to the
evolution of a single and universal god. But there is every reason to
believe that Tezcatlipoca, the great god of the air, like the Hebrew
Jahveh, also an air-god, was fast gaining precedence of all other
deities, when the coming of the white man put in end to his chances of
sovereignty.

## Tezcatlipoca

Tezcatlipoca (Fiery Mirror) was undoubtedly the Jupiter of the Nahua
pantheon. He carried a mirror or shield, from which he took his name,
and in which he was supposed to see reflected the actions and deeds of
mankind. The evolution of this god from the status of a spirit of wind
or air to that of the supreme deity of the Aztec people presents many
points of deep interest to students of mythology. Originally the
personification of the air, the source both of the breath of life and of
the tempest, Tezcatlipoca possessed all the attributes of a god who
presided over these phenomena. As the tribal god of the Tezcucans who
had led them into the Land of Promise, and had been instrumental in the
defeat of both the gods and men of the elder race they dispossessed,
Tezcatlipoca naturally advanced so speedily in popularity and public
honour that it was little wonder that within a comparatively short space
of time he came to be regarded as a god of fate and fortune, and as
inseparably connected with the national destinies. Thus, from being the
peculiar deity of a small band of Nahua immigrants, the prestige
accruing from the rapid conquest made under his tutelary direction and
the speedily disseminated tales of the prowess of those who worshipped
him seemed to render him at once the most popular and the best feared
god in Anahuac, therefore the one whose cult quickly overshadowed that
of other and similar gods.

## Tezcatlipoca, Overthrower of the Toltecs

We find Tezcatlipoca intimately associated with the legends which
recount the overthrow of Tollan, the capital of the Toltecs. His chief
adversary on the Toltec side is the god-king Quetzalcoatl, whose nature
and reign we will consider later, but whom we will now merely regard as
the enemy of Tezcatlipoca. The rivalry between these gods symbolises
that which existed between the civilised Toltecs and the barbarian
Nahua, and is well exemplified in the following myths.

## Myths of Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca

In the days of Quetzalcoatl there was abundance of everything necessary
for subsistence. The maize was plentiful, the calabashes were as thick
as one's arm, and cotton grew in all colours without having to be dyed.
A variety of birds of rich plumage filled the air with their songs, and
gold, silver, and precious stones were abundant. In the reign of
Quetzalcoad there was peace and plenty for all men.

But this blissful state was too fortunate, too happy to endure. Envious
of the calm enjoyment of the god and his people the Toltecs, three
wicked "necromancers" plotted their downfall. The reference is of course
to the gods of the invading Nahua tribes, the deities Huitzilopochtli,
Titlacahuan or Tezcatlipoca, and Tlacahuepan. These laid evil
enchantments upon the city of Tollan, and Tezcatlipoca in particular
took the lead in these envious conspiracies. Disguised as an aged man
with white hair, he presented himself at the palace of Quetzalcoatl,
where he said to the pages. in-waiting: "Pray present me to your master
the king I desire to speak with him."

The pages advised him to retire, as Quetzalcoatl was indisposed and
could see no one. He requested them, however, to tell the god that he
was waiting outside. They did so, and procured his admittance.

On entering the chamber of Quetzalcoad the wily Tezcatlipoca simulated
much sympathy with the suffering god-king. "How are you, my son?" he
asked. "I have brought you a drug which you should drink, and which will
put an end to the course of your malady."

"You are welcome, old man," replied Quetzalcoad.

I have known for many days that you would come. I am exceedingly
indisposed. The malady affects my entire system, and I can use neither
my hands nor feet."

Tezcatlipoca assured him that if he partook of the medicine which he had
brought him he would immediately experience a great improvement in
health. Quetzalcoatl drank the potion, and at once felt much revived.
The cunning Tezcatlipoca pressed another and still another cup of the
potion upon him, and as it was nothing but *pulque*, the wine of the
country, he speedily became intoxicated, and was as wax in the hands of
his adversary.

## Tezcatlipoca and the Toltecs

Tezcatlipoca, in pursuance of his policy inimical to the Toltec state,
took the form of an Indian of the name of Toueyo (Toveyo), and bent his
steps to the palace of Uemac, chief of the Toltecs in temporal matters.
This worthy had a daughter so fair that she was desired in marriage by
many of the Toltecs, but all to no purpose, as her father refused her
hand to one and alL The princess, beholding the false Toueyo passing her
father's palace, fell deeply in love with him, and so tumultuous was her
passion that she became seriously ill because of her longing for him.
Uemac, hearing of her indisposition, bent his steps to her apartments,
and inquired of her women the cause of her illness. They told him that
it was occasioned by the sudden passion which had seized her for the
Indian who had recently come that way. Uemac at once gave orders for the
arrest of Toueyo, and he was haled before the temporal chief of Tollan.

"Whence come you?" inquired Uemac of his prisoner, who was very scantily
attired.

"Lord, I am a stranger, and I have come to these parts to sell green
paint," replied Tezcatlipoca.

"Why are you dressed in this fashion? Why do you not wear a cloak?"
asked the chief.

"My lord, I follow the custom of my country," replied Tezcatlipoca.

"You have inspired a passion in the breast of my daughter," said Uemac.
"What should be done to you for thus disgracing me?"

"Slay me; I care not," said the cunning Tezcatlipoca.

"Nay," replied Uemac, "for if I slay you my daughter will perish. Go to
her and say that she may wed you and be happy."

Now the marriage of Toueyo, to the daughter of Uemac aroused much
discontent among the Toltecs; and they murmured among themselves, and
said: "Wherefore did Uemac give his daughter to this Toueyo?" Uemac,
having got wind of these murmurings, resolved to distract the attention
of the Toltecs by makina war upon the neiahbouringa state of Coatepec.

The Toltecs assembled armed for the fray, and having arrived at the
country of the men of Coatepec they placed Toueyo in ambush with his
body-servants, hoping that he would be slain by their adversaries. But
Toueyo and his men killed a large number of the enemy and put them to
flight. His triumph was celebrated by Uemac with much pomp. The knightly
plumes were placed upon his head, and his body was painted with red and
yellow-an honour reserved for those who distinguished themselves in
battle.

Tezcatlipoca's next step was to announce a great feast in Tollan, to
which all the people for miles around were invited. Great crowds
assembled, and danced and sang in the city to the sound of the drum.
Tezcatlipoca sang to them and forced them to accompany the rhythm of his
song with their feet. Faster and faster the people danced, until the
pace became so furious that they were driven to madness, lost their
footing, and tumbled pell-mell down a deep ravine, where they were
changed into rocks. Others in attempting to cross a stone bridge
precipitated themselves into the water below, and were changed into
stones.

On another occasion Tezcatlipoca presented himself as a valiant warrior
named Tequiua, and invited all the inhabitants of Tollan and its
environs to come to the flower-garden called Xochitla. When assembled
there he attacked them with a hoe, and slew a great number, and others
in panic crushed their comrades to death.

Tezcatlipoca and Tlacahuepan on another occasion repaired to the
market-place of Tollan, the former displaying upon the palm of his hand
a small infant whom he caused to dance and to cut the most amusing
capers. This infant was in reality Huitzilopochdi, the Nahua god of war.
At this sight the Toltecs crowded upon one another for the purpose of
getting a better view, and their eagerness resulted in many being
crushed to death. So enraged were the Toltecs at this that upon the
advice of Tlacahuepan they slew both Tezcatlipoca and Huitzilopochtli.
When this had been done the bodies of the slain gods gave forth such a
pernicious effluvia that thousands the Toltecs died of the pestilence.
The god Tlacahuepan then advised them to cast out the bodies lest worse
befell them, but on their attempting to do so they discovered their
weight to be so great that they could not move them. Hundreds wound
cords round the corpses, but the strands broke, and those who pulled
upon them fell and died suddenly, tumbling one upon the other, and
suffocating those upon whom they collapsed.

## The Departure of Quetzalcoatl

The Toltecs were so tormented by the enchantments of Tezcatlipoca that
it was soon apparent to them that their fortunes were on the wane and
that the end of their empire was at hand. Quetzalcoatl, chagrined at the
turn things had taken, resolved to quit Tollan and go to the country of
Tlapallan, whence he had come on his civilising mission to Mexico. He
burned all the houses which he had built, and buried his treasure of
gold and precious stones in the deep valleys between the mountains. He
changed the cacao-trees into mezquites, and he ordered all the birds of
rich plumage and song to quit the valley of Anahuac and to follow him to
a distance of more than a hundred leagues. On the road from Tollan he
discovered a great tree at a point called Quauhtitlan. There he rested,
and requested his pages to hand him a mirror. Regarding himself in the
polished surface, he exclaimed, "I am old," and from that circumstance
the spot was named Huehuequauhtitlan (Old Quauhtitlan). Proceeding on
his way accompanied by musicians who played the flute, he walked until
fatigue arrested his steps, and he seated himself upon a stone, on which
he left the imprint of his hands. This place is called Temacpalco (The
Impress of the Hands). At Coaapan he was met by the Nahua gods, who were
inimical to him and to the Toltecs.

"Where do you go? they asked him. "Why do you leave your capital?

"I go to Tlapallan," replied Quetzalcoatl, "whence I came."

"For what reason?" persisted the enchanters.

My father the Sun has called me thence," replied Quetzalcoatl.

"Go, then, happily," they said, "but leave us the secret of your art,
the secret of founding in silver, of working in precious stones and
woods, of painting, and of feather-working, and other matters."

But Quetzalcoatl refused, and cast all his treasures into the fountain
of Cozcaapa (Water of Precious Stones). At Cochtan he was met by another
enchanter, who asked him whither he was bound, and on learning his
destination proffered him a draught of wine. On tasting the vintage
Quetzalcoatl was overcome with sleep. Continuing his journey in the
morning, the god passed between a volcano and the Sierra Nevada
(Mountain of Snow), where all the pages who accompanied him died of
cold. He regretted this misfortune exceedingly, and wept, lamenting
their fate with most bitter tears and mournful songs. On reaching the
summit of Mount Poyauhtecatl he slid to the base. Arriving at the
sea-shore, he embarked upon a raft of serpents, and was wafted away
toward the land of Tlapallan.

It is obvious that these legends bear some resemblance to those of
Ixtlilxochitl which recount the fall of the Toltecs. They are taken from
Sahagun's work, *Historya General de Nueva España*, and are included as
well for the sake of comparison as for their own intrinsic value.

## Tezcatlipoca as Doomster

Tezcatlipoca was much more than a mere personification of wind, and if
he was regarded as a life-giver he had also the power of destroying
existence. In fact on occasion he appears as an inexorable death-dealer,
and as such was styled Nezahualpilli (The Hungry Chief) and Yaotzin (The
Enemy). Perhaps one of the names by which he was best known was
Telpochtli (The Youthful Warrior), from the fact that his reserve of'
strength, his vital force, never diminished, and that his youthful and
boisterous vigour was apparent in the tempest.

Tezcatlipoca was usually depicted as holding in his right hand a dart
placed in an atlatl (spear-thrower), and his mirror-shield with four
spare darts in his left. This shield is the symbol of his power as judge
of mankind and upholder of human justice.

The Aztecs pictured Tezcatlipoca as rioting along the highways in search
of persons on whom to wreak his vengeance, as the wind of night rushes
along the deserted roads with more seemingviolence than it does by day.
Indeed one of his names, Yoalli Ehecatl, signifies "Night Wind." Benches
of stone, shaped like those made for the dignitaries of the Mexican
towns, were distributed along the highways for his especial use, that on
these he might rest after his boisterous journeyings. These seats were
concealed by green boughs, beneath which the god was supposed to lurk in
wait for his victims. But if one of the persons he seized overcame him
in the struggle he might ask whatever boon he desired, secure in the
promise of the deity that it should be granted forthwith.

It was supposed that Tezcatlipoca had guided the Nahua, and especially
the people of Tezcuco, from a more northerly clime to the valley of
Mexico. But he was not a mere local deity of Tezcuco, his worship being
widely celebrated throughout the country. His exalted position in the
Mexican pantheon seems to have won for him especial reverence as a god
of fate and fortune. The place he took as the head of the Nahua pantheon
brought him many attributes which were quite foreign to his original
character. Fear and a desire to exalt their tutelar deity will impel the
devotees of a powerful god to credit him with any or every quality, so
that there is nothing remarkable in the spectacle of the heaping of
every possible attribute, human or divine, upon Tezcatlipoca when we
recall the supreme position he occupied in Mexican mythology. His
priestly caste far surpassed in power and in the breadth and activity of
its propaganda the priesthoods of the other Mexican deities. To it is
credited the invention of many of the usages of civilisation, and that
it all but succeeded in making his worship universal is pretty clear, as
has been shown. The other gods were worshipped for some special purpose,
but the worship of Tezcatlipoca was regarded as compulsory, and to some
extent as a safeguard against the destruction of the universe, a
calamity the Nahua had been led tn believe might occur through his
agency. He was known as Moneneque (The Claimer of Prayer), and in some
of the representations of him an ear of gold was shown suspended from
his hair, toward which small tongues of gold strained upward in appeal
of prayer. In times of national danger, plague, or famine universal
prayer was made to Tezcatlipoca. The heads of the community repaired to
his *teocalli* (temple) accompanied by the people *en masse*, and all
prayed earnestly together for his speedy intervention. The prayers to
Tezcatlipoca still extant prove that the ancient Mexicans fully believed
that he possessed the power of life and death, and many of them are
couched in the most piteous terms.

## The Teotleco Festival

The supreme position occupied by Tezcatlipoca in the Mexican religion is
well exemplified in the festival of the Teotleco (Coming of the Gods),
which is fully described in Sahagun's account of the Mexican festivals.
Another peculiarity connected with his worship was that he was one of
the few Mexican deities who had any relation to the expiation of sin.
Sin was symbolised by the Nahua as excrement, and in various manuscripts
Tezcatlipoca is represented as a turkey-cock to which ordure is being
offered up.

Of the festival of the Teotleco Sahagun says In the twelfth month a
festival was celebrated in honour of all the gods, who were said to have
gone to some country I know not where. On the last day of the month a
greater one was held, because the gods had returned. On the fifteenth
day of this month the young boys and the servitors decked all the altars
or oratories of the gods with boughs, as well as those which were in the
houses, and the images which were set up by the wayside and at the
cross-roads. This work was paid for in maize. Some received a basketful,
and others only a few ears. On the eighteenth day the ever-youthful god
Tlamatzincatl or Titlacahuan arrived. It was said that he marched better
and arrived the first because he was strong and young. Food was offered
him in his temple on that night. Every one drank, ate, and made merry.
The old people especially celebrated the arrival of the god by drinking
wine, and it was alleged that his feet were washed by these rejoicings.
The last day of the month was marked by a great festival, on account of
the belief that the whole or the gods arrived at that time. On the
preceding night a quantity of flour was kneaded on a carpet into the
shape of a cheese, it being supposed that the gods would leave a
footprint thereon as a sign of their return. The chief attendant watched
all night, going to and fro to see if the impression appeared. When he
at last saw it he called out, 'The master has arrived,' and at once the
priests of the temple began to sound the horns, trumpets, and other
musical instruments used by them. Upon hearing this noise every one set
forth to offer food in all the temples." The next day the aged gods were
supposed to arrive, and young men disguised as monsters hurled victims
into a huge sacrificial fire.

## The Toxcatl Festival

The most remarkable festival in connection with Tezcatlipoca was the
Toxcatl, held in the fifth month. On the day of this festival a youth
was slain who for an entire year previously had been carefully
instructed in the *rôle* of victim. He was selected from among the best
war captives of the year, and must be without spot or blemish. He
assumed the name, garb, and attributes of Tezcatlipoca himself, and was
regarded with awe by the entire populace, who imagined him to be the
earthly representative of the deity. He rested during the day, and
ventured forth at night only, armed with the dart and shield of the god,
to scour the roads. This practice was, of course, symbolical of the
wind-god's progress over the nightbound hiahwavs. He carried also the
whistle symbolical of the deity, and made with it a noise such as the
weird wind of night makes when it hurries through the streets. To his
arms and legs small bells were attached. He was followed by a retinue of
pages, and at intervals rested upon the stone seats which were placed
upon the highways for the convenience of Tezcatlipoca. Later in the year
he was mated to four beautiful maidens of high birth, with whom he
passed the time in amusement of every description. He was entertained at
the tables of the nobility as the earthly representative of
Tezcatlipoca, and his latter days were one constant round of feasting
and excitement. At last the fatal day upon which he must be sacrificed
arrived. He took a tearful farewell of the maidens whom he had espoused,
and was carried to the teocalli of sacrifice, upon the sides of which he
broke the musical instruments with which he had beguiled the time of his
captivity. When he reached the summit he was received by the
high-priest, who speedily made him one with the god whom he represented
by tearing his heart out on the stone of sacrifice.

## Huitzilopochth, the War,God

Huitzilopochtli occupied in the Aztec pantheon a place similar to that
of Mars in the Roman. His origin is obscure, but the myth relating to it
is distinctly original in character. It recounts how, under the shadow
of the mountain of Coatepec, near the Toltec city of Tollan, there dwelt
a pious widow called Coatlicue, the mother of a tribe of Indians called
Centzonuitznaua) who had a daughter called Coyolxauhqui, and who daily
repaired to a small hill with the intention of offering up prayers to
the gods in a penitent spirit of piety. Whilst occupied in her devotions
one day she was surprised by a small ball of brilliantly coloured
feathers falling upon her from on high. She was pleased by the bright
variety of its hues, and placed it in her bosom, intending to offer it
up to the sun-god. Some time afterwards she learnt that she was to
become the mother of another child. Her sons, hearing of this, rained
abuse upon her, being incited to humiliate her in every possible way by
their sister Coyolxauhqui.

Coatlicue went about in fear and anxiety; but the spirit of her unborn
infant came and spoke to her and gave her words of encouragement,
soothing her troubled heart. Her sons, however, were resolved to wipe
out what they considered an insult to their race by the death of their
mother, and took counsel with one another to slay her. They attired
themselves in their war-gear, and arranged their hair after the manner
of warriors going to battle. But one of their number, Quauitlicac,
relented, and confessed the perfidy of his brothers to the still unborn
Huitzilopochtli, who replied to him: "O brother, hearken attentively to
what I have to say to you. I am fully informed of what is about to
happen." With the intention of slaying their mother, the Indians went in
search of her. At their head marched their sister, Coyolxauhqui. They
were armed to the teeth, and carried bundles of darts with which
theyintended to kill the luckless Coatlicue.

Quauitlicac climbed the mountain to acquaint Huitzilopochtli with the
news that his brothers were approaching to kill their mother.

"Mark well where they are at," replied the infant god. "To what place
have they advanced?"

"To Tzompantitlan," responded Quauitlicac.

Later on Huitzilopochtli asked: "Where may they be now?"

"At Coaxalco", was the reply.

Once more Huitzilopochtli asked to what point his enemies had advanced.

"They are now at Petlac," Quauitlicac replied.

After a little while Quauitlicac informed Huitzilopochtli that the
Centzonuitznaua were at hand under the leadership of Coyolxauhqui. At
the moment of the enemy's arrival Huitzilopochtli was born, flourishing
a shield and spear of a blue colour. He was painted, his head was
surmounted by a panache, and his left leg was covered with feathers. He
shattered Coyolxauhqui with a flash of serpentine lightning, and then
gave chase to the Centzonuitznaua, whom he pursued four times round the
mountain. They did not attempt to defend themselves, but fled
incontinently. Many perished in the waters of the adjoining lake, to
which they had rushed in their despair. All were slain save a few who
escaped to a place called Uitzlampa, where they surrendered to
Huitzilopochtli and gave up their arms.

The name Huitzilopochtli signifies "Humming-bird to the left from the
circumstance that the god wore the feathers of the humming-bird, or
*colibri*, on his left leg. From this it has been inferred that he was a
humming-bird totem. The explanation of Huitzilopochtli's origin is a
little deeper than this, however. Among the American tribes, especially
those of the northern continent, the serpent is regarded with the
deepest veneration as the symbol of wisdom and magic. From these sources
come success in war. The serpent also typifies the lightning, the symbol
of the divine spear, the apotheosis of warlike might. Fragments of
serpents are regarded as powerful war-physic among many tribes.
Atatarho, a mythical wizard-king of the Iroquois, was clothed with
living serpents as with a robe, and his myth throws light on one of the
names of Huitzilopochtli's mother, Coatlantona (Robe of Serpents).
Huitzilopochtli's image was surrounded by serpents, and rested on
serpent-shaped supporters. His sceptre was a single snake, and his great
drum was of serpent-skin.

In American mythology the serpent is closely associated with the bird.
Thus the name of the god Quetzalcoatl is translatable as "Feathered
Serpent," and many similar cases where the conception of bird and
serpent have been unified could be adduced. Huitzilopochtli is
undoubtedly one of these. We may regard him as a god the primary
conception of whom arose from the idea of the serpent, the symbol of
warlike wisdom and might, the symbol of the warrior's dart or spear, and
the humming-bird, the harbinger of summer, type of the season when the
snake or lightning god has power over the crops.

Huitzilopochtli was usually represented as wearing on his head a waving
panache or plume of hummingbirds' feathers. His face and limbs were
striped with bars of blue, and in his right hand he carried four spears.
His left hand bore his shield, on the surface of which were displayed
five tufts of down, arranged in the form of a quincunx. The shield was
made with reeds, covered with eagle's down. The spear he brandished was
also tipped with tufts of down instead of flint. These weapons were
placed in the hands of those who as captives engaged in the sacrificial
fight, for in the Aztec mind Hultzilopochtli symbolised the warrior's
death on the gladiatorial stone of combat. As has been said,
Huitzilopochtli was war-god of the Aztecs, and was supposed to have led
them to the site of Mexico from their original home in the north. The
city of Mexico took its name from one of its districts, which was
designated by a title of Huitzilopochtli's, Mexitli (Hare of the Aloes).

## The War,God as Fertiliser

But Huitzilopochtli was not a war-god alone. As the serpent-god of
lightning he had a connection with summer, the season of lightning, and
therefore had dominion to some extent over the crops and fruits of the
earth. The Algonquian Indians of North America believed that the
rattlesnake could raise ruinous storms or grant favourable breezes. They
alluded to it also as the symbol of life, for the serpent has a phallic
significance because of its similarity to the symbol of generation and
fructification. With some American tribes also, notably the Pueblo
Indians of Arizona, the serpent has a solar significance, and with tail
in mouth symbolises the annual round of the sun. The Nahua believed that
Huitzilopochtli could grant them fair weather for the fructification of
their crops, and they placed an image of Tlaloc, the rain-god, near him,
so that, if necessary, the war-god could compel the rainmaker to exert
his pluvial powers or to abstain from the creation of floods. We must,
in considering the nature of this deity, bear well in mind the
connection in the Nahua consciousness between the pantheon, war, and the
food-supply. If war was not waged annually the gods must go without
flesh food and perish, and if the gods succumbed the crops would fail,
and famine would destroy the race. So it was small wonder that
Huitzilopochtli was one of the chief gods of Mexico.

Huitzilopochtli's principal festival was the Toxcatl, celebrated
immediately after the Toxcatl festival of Tezcatlipoca, to which it bore
a strong resemblance. Festivals of the god were held in May and
December, at the latter of which an imaze of him, moulded in dough
kneaded with the blood of sacrificed children, was pierced by the
presiding priest with an arrow-an act significant of the death of
Huitzilopochtli until his resurrection in the next year.

Strangely enough, when the absolute supremacy of Tezcatlipoca is
remembered, the high-priest of Huitzilopochtli, the Mexicatl Teohuatzin,
was considered to be the religious head of the Mexican priesthood. The
priests of Huitzilopochtli held office by right of descent, and their
primate exacted absolute obedience from the priesthoods of all the other
deities, being regarded as next to the monarch himself in power and
dominion.

## Tlaloc, the Rain,God

Tlaloc was the god of rain and moisture. In a country such as Mexico,
where the success or failure of the crops depends entirely upon the
plentiful nature or otherwise of the rainfall, he was, it will be
readily granted, a deity of high importance. It was believed that he
made his home in the mountains which surround the valley of Mexico, as
these were the source of the local rainfall, and his popularity is
vouched for by the fact that sculptured representations of him occur
more often than those of any other of the Mexican deities. He is
generally represented in a semi-recumbent attitude, with the upper part
of the body raised upon the elbows, and the knees half drawn up,
probably to represent the mountainous character of the country whence
comes the rain. He was espoused to Chalchihuitlicue (Emerald Lady), who
bore him a numerous progeny, the Tlalocs (Clouds). Many of the figures
which represented him were carved from the green stone called
*chalchiuitl* (jadeite), to typify the colour of water, and in some of
these he was shown holding a a serpent of gold to typify the lightning,
for water-gods are often closely identified with the thunder, which
hangs over the hills and accompanies heavy rains. Tlaloc, like his
prototype, the Kiche god Hurakan, manifested himself in three forms, as
the lightning-flash, the thunderbolt, and the thunder. Although his
image faced the east, where he was supposed to have originated, he was
worshipped as inhabiting the four cardinal points and every
mountain-top. The colours of the four points of the compass, yellow,
green, red, and blue, whence came the rain-bearing winds, entered into
the composition of his costume, which was further crossed with streaks
of silver, typifying the mountain torrents. A vase containing every
description of grain was usually placed before his idol, an offering of
the growth which it was hoped he would fructify. He dwelt in a
many-watered paradise called Tlalocan (The Country of Tlaloc), a place
of plenty and fruitfulness, where those who had been drowned or struck
by lightning or had died from dropsical diseases enjoyed eternal bliss.
Those of the common people who did not die such deaths went to the dark
abode of Mictlan, the all-devouring and gloomy Lord of Death.

In the native manuscripts Tlaloc is usually portrayed as having a dark
complexion, a large round eye, a row of tusks, and over the lips an
angular blue stripe curved downward and rolled up at the ends. The
latter character is supposed to have been evolved originally from the
coils of two snakes, their mouths with long fangs in the upper jaw
meeting in the middle of the upper lip. The snake, besides being
symbolised by lightning in many American mythologies, is also symbolical
of water, which is well typified in its sinuous movements.

Many maidens and children were annually sacrificed to Tlaloc. If the
children wept it was regarded as a happy omen for a rainy season. The
Etzalqualiztli (When they eat Bean Food) was his chief festival, and was
held on a day approximating to May 13, about which date the rainy season
usually commenced. Another festival in his honour, the Quauitleua,
commenced the Mexican year on February 2. At the former festival the
priests of Tlaloc plunged into a lake, imitating the sounds and
movements of frogs, which, as denizens of water, were under the special
protection of the god. Chalchihuitlicue, his wife, was often symbolised
by the small image of a frog.

## Sacrifices to Tlaloc

Human sacrifices also took place at certain points in the mountains
where artificial ponds were consecrated to Tlaloc. Cemeteries were
situated in their vicinity, and offerings to the god interred near the
burial-place of the bodies of the victims slain in his service. His
statue was placed on the highest mountain of Tezcuco, and an old writer
mentions that five or six young children were annually offered to the
god at various points, their hearts torn out, and their remains
interred. The mountains Popocatepetl and Teocuinani were regarded as his
special high places, and on the heights of the latter was built his
temple, in which stood his image carved in green stone.

The Nahua believed that the constant production of food and rain induced
a condition of senility in those deities whose duty it was to provide
them. This they attempted to stave off, fearing that if they failed in
so doing the gods would perish. They afforded them, accordingly, a
period of rest and recuperation, and once in eight years a festival
called the Atamalqualiztli (Fast of Porridge-balls and Water) was held,
during which every one in the Nahua community returned for the time
being to the conditions of savage life. Dressed in costumes representing
all forms of animal and bird life, and mimicking the sounds made by the
various creatures they typified, the people danced round the *teocalli*
of Tlaloc for the purpose of diverting and entertaining him after his
labours in producing the fertilising rains of the past eight years. A
lake was filled with water-snakes and frogs, and into this the people
plunged, catching the reptiles in their mouths and devouring them alive.
The only grain food which might be partaken during this season of rest
was thin water-porridge of maize.

Should one of the more prosperous peasants or yeomen deem a rainfall
necessary to the growth of his crops, or should he fear a drought, he
sought out one of the professional makers of dough or paste idols, whom
he desired to mould one of Tlaloc. To this image offerings of
maize-porridge and pulque were made. Throughout the night the farmer and
his neighbours danced, shrieking and howling round the figure for the
purpose of rousing Tlaloc from his droughtbringing slumbers. Next day
was spent in quaffing huge libations of pulque, and in much-needed rest
from the exertions of the previous night.

In Tlaloc it is easy to trace resemblances to a mythological conception
widely prevalent among the indigenous American peoples. He is similar to
such deities as the Hurakan of the Kiche of Guatemala, the Pillan of the
aborigines of Chile, and Con, the thunder-god of the Collao of Peru.
Only his thunderous powers are not so apparent as his rain-making
abilities, and in this he differs somewhat from the gods alluded to.

## Quetzalcoatl

It is highly probable that Quetzalcoatl was a deity of the pre-Nahua
people of Mexico. He was regarded by the Aztec race as a god of somewhat
alien character, and had but a limited following in Mexico, the city of
Huitzilopochtli. In Cholula, however, and others of the older towns his
worship flourished exceedingly. He was regarded as "The Father of the
Toltecs," and, legend says, was the seventh and youngest son of the
Toltec Abraham, Iztacmixcohuatl. Quetzalcoatl (whose name means
"Feathered Serpent " or "Feathered Staff ") became, at a relatively
early period, ruler of Tollan, and by his enlightened sway and his
encouragement of the liberal arts did much to further the advancement of
his people. His reign had lasted for a period sufficient to permit of
his placing the cultivated arts upon a satisfactory basis when the
country was visited by the cunning magicians Tezcatlipoca and
Coyotlinaual, god of the Amantecas. Disentangled from its terms of myth,
this statement may be taken to imply that bands of invading Nahua first
began to appear within the Toltec territories. Tezcatlipoca, descending
from the sky in the shape of a spider by way of a fine web, proffered
him a draught of *pulque*, which so intoxicated him that the curse of
lust descended upon him, and he forgot his chastity with Quetzalpetlatl.
The doom pronounced upon him was the hard one of banishment, and he was
compelled to forsake Anahuac. His exile wrought peculiar changes upon
the face of the country. He secreted his treasures of gold and silver,
burned his palaces, transformed the cacao-trees into mezquites, and
banished all the birds from the neighbourhood of Tollan. The magicians,
nonplussed at these unexpected happenings, begged him to return, but he
refused on the ground that the sun required his presence. He proceeded
to Tabasco, the fabled land of Tlapallan, and, embarking upon a raft
made of serpents, floated away to the east. A slightly different version
of this myth has already been given. Other accounts state that the king
cast himself upon a funeral pyre and was consumed, and that the ashes
arising from the conflagration flew upward and were changed into birds
of brilliant plumage. His heart also soared into the sky, and became the
morning star. The Mexicans averred that Quetzalcoatl died when the star
became visible, and thus they bestowed upon him the title "Lord of the
Dawn." They further said that when he died he was invisible for four
days, and that for eight days he wandered in the underworld, after which
time the morning star appeared, when he achieved resurrection, and
ascended his throne as a god.

It is the contention of some authorities that the myth of Quetzalcoatl
points to his status as god of the sun. That luminary, they say, begins
his diurnal journey in the east, whence Quetzalcoatl returned as to his
native home. It will be recalled that Montezuma and his subjects
imagined that Cortés was no other than Quetzalcoatl, returned to his
dominions, as an old prophecy declared he would do. But that he stood
for the sun itself is highly improbable, as will be shown. First of all,
however, it will be well to pay some attention to other theories
concerning his origin.

Perhaps the most important of these is that which regards Quetzalcoatl
as a god of the air. He is connected, say some, with the cardinal
points, and wears the insignia of the cross, which symbolises them. Dr.
Seler says of him: "He has a protruding, trumpet-like mouth, for the
wind-god blows. . . . His figure suggests whirls and circles. Hence his
temples were built in circular form. . . . The head of the wind-god
stands for the second of the twenty day signs, which was called Ehecatl
(Wind)." The same authority, however, in his essay on Mexican
chronology, gives to Quetzalcoatl a dual nature, " the dual nature which
seems to belong to the wind-god Quetzalcoatl) who now appears simply a
wind-god, and again seems to show the true, characters of the old god of
fire and light." \[Bulletin 28 of the U.S. Bureau of Ethnology.\]

Dr. Brinton perceived in Quetzalcoatl a similar dual nature. "He is both
lord of the eastern light and of the winds, he writes (*Myths of the New
World*, P. 214)- "Like all the dawn heroes, he too was represented as of
white complexion, clothed in long, white robes, and, as many of the
Aztec gods, with a full and flowing beard. . . . He had been overcome by
Tezcatloca, the wind or spirit of night, who had descended from heaven
by a spider's web, and presented his rival with a draught supposed to
confer immortality, but in fact producing an intolerable longing for
home. For the wind and the light both depart when the gloaming draws
near, or when the clouds spread their dark and shadowy webs along the
mountains, and pour the vivifying rain upon the fields."

The theory which derives Quetzalcoatl from a "culture-hero " who once
actually existed is scarcely reconcilable with probability. It is more
than likely that, as in the case of other mythical paladins, the legend
of a mighty hero arose from the somewhat weakened idea of a great deity.
Some of the early Spanish missionaries professed to see in Quetzalcoatl
the Apostle St. Thomas, who had journeyed to America to effect its
conversion!

## The Man of the Sun

A more probable explanation of the origin of Quetzalcoatl and a more
likely elucidation of his nature is that which would regard him as the
Man of the Sun, who has quitted his abode for a season for the purpose
of inculcating in mankind those arts which represent the first steps in
civilisation, who fulfils his mission, and who, at a late period, is
displaced by the deities of an invading race. Quetzalcoatl was
represented as a traveller with staff in hand, and this is proof of his
solar character, as is the statement that under his rule the fruits of
the earth flourished more abundantly than at any subsequent period. The
abundance of gold said to have been accumulated in his reign assists the
theory, the precious metal being invariably associated with the sun by
most barbarous peoples. In the native pinturas it is noticeable that the
solar disc and semidisc are almost invariably found in connection with
the feathered serpent as the symbolical attributes of Quetzalcoad. The
Hopi Indians of Mexico at the present day symbolise the sun as a
serpent, tail in mouth, and the ancient Mexicans introduced the solar
disc in connection with small images of Quetzalcoatl, which they
attached to the head-dress. In still other examples Quetzalcoatl is
pictured as if emerging or stepping from the luminary, which is
represented as his dwelling-place.

Several tribes tributary to the Aztecs were in the habit of imploring
Quetzalcoatl in prayer to return and free them from the intolerable
bondage of the conqueror. Notable among them were the Totonacs, who
passionately believed that the sun, their father, would send a god who
would free them from the Aztec yoke. On the coming of the Spaniards the
European conquerors were hailed as the servants of Quetzalcoatl, thus in
the eyes of the natives fulfilling the tradition that he would return.

## Various Forms of Quetzalcoatl

Various conceptions of Quetzalcoad are noticeable in the mythology of
the territories which extended from the north of Mexico to the marshes
of Nicaragua. In Guatemala the Kiches recognised him as Gucumatz, and in
Yucatan proper he was worshipped as Kukulcan, both of which names are
but literal translations of his Mexican title of "Feathered Serpent"
into Kiche and Mayan. That the three deities are one and the same there
can be no shadow of doubt. Several authorities have seen in Kukulcan a
"serpent-and-rain god." He can only be such in so far as he is a solar
god also. The cult of the feathered snake in Yucatan was unquestionably
a branch of sun-worship. In tropical latitudes the sun draws the clouds
round him at noon. The rain falls from the clouds accompanied by thunder
and lightning-the symbols of the divine serpent. Therefore the
manifestations of the heavenly serpent were directly associated with the
sun, and no statement that Kukulcan is a mere serpent-and-water god
satisfactorily elucidates his characteristics.

## Quetzalcoatl's Northern Origin

It is by no means improbable that Quetzalcoatl was of northern origin,
and that on his adoption by southern peoples and tribes dwelling in
tropical countries his characteristics were gradually and unconsciously
altered in order to meet the exigencies of his environment. The
mythology of the Indians of British Columbia, whence in all likelihood
the Nahua originally came, is possessed of a central figure bearing a
strong resemblance to Quetzalcoad. Thus the Thlingit tribe worship Yetl;
the Quaquiutl Indians, Kanikilak; the Salish people of the coast,
Kumsnöotl, Quäaqua, or Släalekam. It is noticeable that these divine
beings are worshipped as the Man of the Sun, and totally apart from the
luminary himself, as was Quetzalcoatl in Mexico. The Quaquiutl believe
that before his settlement among them for the purpose of inculcating in
the tribe the arts of life, the sun descended as a bird, and assumed a
human shape. Kanikilak is his son, who, as his emissary, spreads the
arts of civilisation over the world. So the Mexicans believed that
Quetzalcoatl descended first of all in the form of a bird, and was
ensnared in the fowler's net of the Toltec hero Hueymatzin.

The titles bestowed upon Quetzalcoatl by the Nahua show that in his
solar significance he was god of the vault of the heavens, as well as
merely son of the sun. He was alluded to as Ehecatl (The Air), Yolcuat
(The Rattlesnake), Tohil (The Rumbler), Nanihehecatl (Lord of the Four
Winds), Tlauizcalpantecutli (Lord of the Light of the Dawn). The whole
heavenly vault was his, together with all its phenomena. This would seem
to be in direct opposition to the theory that Tezcatlipoca was the
supreme god of the Mexicans. But it must be borne in mind that
Tezcatlipoca was the god of a later age, and of a fresh body of Nahua
immigrants, and as such inimical to Quetzalcoatl, who was probably in a
similar state of opposition to Itzamna, a Maya deity of Yucatan.

## The Worship of Quetzalcoatl

The worship of Quetzalcoatl was in some degree antipathetic to that of
the other Mexican deities, and his priests were a separate caste.
Although human sacrifice was by no means so prevalent among his
devotees, it is a mistake to aver, as some authorities have done, that
it did not exist in connection with his worship. A more acceptable
sacrifice to Quetzalcoatl appears to have been the blood of the
celebrant or worshipper, shed by himself. When we come to consider the
mythology of the Zapotecs, a people whose Customs and beliefs appear to
have formed a species of link between the Mexican and Mayan
civilisations, we shall find that their high-priests occasionally
enacted the legend of Quetzalcoad in their own persons, and that their
worship, which appears to have been based upon that of Quetzalcoatl, had
as one of its most pronounced characteristics the shedding of blood. The
celebrant or devotee drew blood from the vessels lying under the tongue
or behind the ear by drawing across those tender parts a cord made from
the thorn-covered fibres of the agave. The blood was smeared over the
mouths of the idols. In this practice we can perceive an act analogous
to the sacrificial substitution of the part for the whole, as obtaining
in early Palestine and many other countries-a certain sign that tribal
or racial opinion has contracted a disgust for human sacrifice, and has
sought to evade. the anger of the gods by yielding to them a ortion of
the blood of each worshipper, instead of sacrificing the life of one for
the general weal.

## The Maize-Gods of Mezico

A special group of deities called Centeotl presided over the agriculture
of Mexico, each of whom personified one or other of the various aspects
of the maize-plant. The chief goddess of maize, however, was
Chicomecohuatl (Seven-serpent), her name being an allusion to the
fertilising power of water, which element the Mexicans symbolised by the
serpent. As Xilonen she typified the *xilote*, or green ear of the
maize. But it is probable that Chicomecohuatl was the creation of an
older race, and that the Nahua new-comers adopted or brought with them
another growth-spirit, the"Earth-mother," Teteoinnan (Mother of the
Gods), or Tocitzin (Our Grandmother). This goddess had a son, Centeotl,
a male maize-spirit. Sometimes the mother was also known as Centeotl,
the generic name for the entire group, and this fact has led to some
confusion in the minds of Americanists. But this does not mean that
Chicomecohuatl was by any means neglected. Her spring festival, held on
April 5, was known as Hueytozoztli (The Great Watch), and was
accompanied by a general fast, when the dwellings of the Mexicans were
decorated with bulrushes which had been sprinkled with blood drawn from
the extremities of the inmates. The statues of the little *tepitoton*
(household gods) were also decorated. The worshippers then proceeded to
the maize-fields, where they pulled the tender stalks of the growing
maize, and, having decorated them with flowers, placed them in the
*calpulli* (the common house of the village). A mock combat then took
place before the altar of Chicomecohuatl. The girls of the village
presented the goddess with bundles of maize of the previous season's
harvesting, later restoring them to the granaries in order that they
might be utilised for seed for the coming year. Chicomecohuatl was
always represented among the household deities of the Mexicans, and on
the occasion of her festival the family placed before the image a basket
of provisions sur. mounted by a cooked frog, bearing on its back a piece
of cornstalk stuffed with pounded maize and vegetables. This frog was
symbolic of Chalchihuitlicue, wife of TIaloc, the rain-god, who assisted
Chicomecohuatl in providg a bountiful harvest. In order that the soil
might rther benefit, a frog, the symbol of water, was sacrificed, so
that its vitality should recuperate that of the weary and much-burdened
earth.

## The Sacrifice of the Dancer

A more important festival of Chicomecohuatl, however, was the Xalaquia,
which lasted from June 28 to July 14, commencing when the maize plant
had attained its full growth. The women of the *pueblo* (village) wore
their hair unbound, and shook and tossed it so that by sympathetic magic
the maize might take the hint and grow correspondingly long. Chian
pinolli was consumed in immense quantities, and maize porridge was
eaten. Hilarious dances were nightly performed in the *teopan* (temple),
the central figure in which was the Xalaquia, a female captive or slave,
with face painted red and yellow to represent the colours of the
maize-plant. She had previously under gone a long course of training in
the dancing-school, and now, all unaware of the horrible fate awaiting
her, she danced and pirouetted gaily among the rest. Throughout the
duration of the stival she danced and on its expiring night she was
accompanied in the dance by the women of the community, who circled
round her, chanting the deeds of Chicomecohuatl. When daybreak appeared
the company was joined by the chiefs and headmen, who, along with the
exhausted and half-fainting victim, danced the solemn death-dance. The
entire community then approached the *teocalli* (pyramid of sacrifice),
and, its summit reached, the victim was stripped to a nude condition,
the priest plunged a knife of flint into her bosom, and, tearing out the
still palpitating heart, offered it up to Chicomecohuatl. In this manner
the venerable goddess, weary with the labours of inducing growth in the
maize-plant, was supposed to be revivified and refreshed. Hence the name
Xalaquia, which signifies "She who is clothed with the Sand." Until the
death of the victim it was not lawful to partake of the new corn.

The general appearance of Chicomecohuatl was none too pleasing. Her
image rests in the National Museum in Mexico, and is girdled with
snakes. On the underside the symbolic frog is carved. The Americanists;
of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were unequal to the
task of elucidating the origin of the figure, which they designated
Teoyaominqui. The first to point out the error was Payne, in his
*History of the New World called America*, Vol. i. p. 424. The passage
in which he announces his discovery is of such real interest that it is
worth transcribing fully.

## An Antiquarian Mare's-Nest

"All the great idols of Mexico were thought to have been destroyed until
this was disinterred among other relics in the course of making new
drains in the Plaza Mayor of Mexico in August 1790. The discovery
produced an immense sensation. The idol was dragged to the court of the
University, and there set up; the Indians began to worship it and deck
it with flowers; the antiquaries, with about the same degree of
intelligence, to speculate about it. What most puzzled them was that the
face and some other parts of the goddess are found in duplicate at the
back or the figure; hence they concluded it to represent two gods in
one, the principal of whom they further concluded to be a female, the
other, indicated by the back, a male. The standard author on Mexican
antiquities at that time was the Italian *dilettante* Boturini, of whom
it may be said that he is better, but not much better, than nothing at
all. From page 27 of his work the antiquaries learned that
Huitzilopochtli was accompanied by the goddess Teoyaominqui, who was
charged with collecting the souls of those slain in war and sacrifice.
This was enough. The figure was at once named Teoyaominqui or
Huitzilopochtli (The One plus the Other), and has been so called ever
since. The antiquaries next elevated this imaginary goddess to the rank
of the war-god's wife. 'A soldier,' says Bardolph, 'is better
accommodated than with a wife': *a fortiori*, so is a war-god. Besides,
as Torquemada (vol, ii. p.47) says with perfect truth, the Mexicans did
not think so grossly of the divinity as to have married gods or
goddesses at all. The figure is undoubtedly a female. It has no vestige
of any weapon about it, nor has it any limbs. It differs in every
particular from the war-god Huitzilopochtli, every detail of which is
perfectly well known. There never was any goddess called Teoyaominqui.
This may be plausibly inferred from the fact that such a goddess is
unknown not merely to Sahagun, Torquemada, Acosta, Tezozomoc, Duran, and
Clavigero, but to all other writers except Boturini. The blunder of the
last-named writer is easily explained. Antonio Leon y Gama, a Mexican
astronomer, wrote an account of the discoveries Of 1790, in which,
evidently puzzled by the name of Teoyaominqui, he quotes a manuscript in
Mexican, said to have been written by an Indian of Tezcuco, who was born
in 1528, to the effect that Teoyaotlatohua and Teoyaominqui were spirits
who presided over the fifteenth of the twenty signs of the
fortune-tellers' calendar, and that those born in this sign would be
brave warriors, but would soon die. (As the fifteenth sign was
*quauhtli*, this is likely enough.) When their hour had come the former
spirit scented them out, the latter killed them. The rubbish printed
about Huitzilopochtli, Teoyaominqui, and Mictlantecutli in connection
with this statue would fill a respectable volume. The reason why the
features were duplicated is obvious. The figure was carried in the midst
of a large crowd. Probably it was considered to be an evil omen if the
idol turned away its face from its worshippers; this the duplicate
obviated. So when the dance was performed round the figure (*cf*.
Janus). This duplication of the features, a characteristic of the very
oldest gods, appears to be indicated when the numeral *ome* (two) is
prefixed to the title of the deity. Thus the two ancestors and
preservers of the race were called Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl
(two-chief, two-woman), ancient Toltec gods, who at the conquest become
less prominent in the theology of Mexico, and who are best represented
in that of the Mexican colony of Nicaragua."

## The Offering to Centeotl

During her last hours the victim sacrificed at the Xalaquia wore a
ritual dress made from the fibres of the aloe, and with this garment the
maize-god Centeotl was clothed. Robed in this he temporarily represented
the earth-goddess, so that he might receive her sacrifice. The blood of
victims was offered up to him in a vessel decorated with that brilliant
and artistic featherwork which excited such admiration in the breasts of
the connoisseurs and cesthetes of the Europe of the sixteenth century.
Upon partaking of this blood-offering the deity emitted a groan so
intense and terrifying that it has been left on record that such
Spaniards as were present became panic-stricken. This ceremony was
followed by another, the *nitiçapoloa* (tasting of the soil), which
consisted in raising a little earth on one finger to the mouth and
eating it.

As has been said, Centeotl the son has been confounded with Centeotl the
mother, who is in reality the earth-mother Teteoinnan. Each of these
deities bad a teopan (temple) of his or her own, but they were closely
allied as parent and child. But of the two, Centeotl the son was the
more important. On the death of the sacrificed victim her skin was
conveyed to the temple of Centeotl the son, and worn there in the
succeeding ritual by the officiating priests. This gruesome dress is
frequently depicted in the Aztec *pinturas*, where the skin of the
hands, and in some instances the feet, of the victims can be seen
dangling from the wrists and ankles of the priest.

## Importance of the Food-Gods

To the Mexicans the deities of most importance to the community as a
whole were undoubtedly the food-gods. In their emergence from the
hunting to the agricultural state of life, when they began to exist
almost solely upon the fruits of the earth, the Mexicans were quick to
recognise that the old deities of the chase, such as Mixcoatl, could not
now avail them or succour them in the same manner as the guardians of
the crops and fertilisers of the soil. Gradually we see these gods,
then, advance in power and influence until at the time of the Spanish
invasion we find them paramount. Even the terrible war-god himself had
an agricultural significance, as we have pointed out. A distinct bargain
with the food-gods can be clearly traced, and is none the less obvious
because it was never written or codified. The covenant was as binding to
the native mind as any made betwixt god and man in ancient Palestine,
and included mutual assistance as well as provision for mere alimentary
supply. In no mythology is the understanding between god and man so
clearly defined as in the Nahuan, and in none is its operation better
exemplified.

## Xipe

Xipe (The Flayed) was widely worshipped through,out Mexico, and is
usually depicted in the *pinturas* as being attired in a flayed human
skin. At his special festival, the "Man-flaying," the skins were removed
from the victims and worn by the devotees of the god for the succeeding
twenty days. He is usually represented as of a red colour. In the later
days of the Aztec monarchy the kings and leaders of Mexico assumed the
dress or classical garments of Xipe. This dress consisted of a crown
made of feathers of the roseate spoonbill, the gilt timbrel, the jacket
of spoonbill feathers, and an apron of green feathers lapping over one
another in a tile-like pattern. In the Cozcatzin Codex we see a picture
of King Axayacatl dressed as Xipe in a feather skirt, and having a
tiger-skin scabbard to his sword. The hands of a flayed human skin also
dangle over the monarch's wrists, and the feet fall over his feet like
gaiters.

Xipe's shield is a round target covered with the rose-coloured feathers
of the spoonbill, with concentric circles of a darker hue on the
surface. There are examples of it divided into an upper and lower part,
the former showing an emerald on a blue field, and the latter a
tiger-skin design. Xipe was imagined as possessing three forms, the
first that of the roseate spoon. bill, the second that of the blue
cotinga, and the last that of a tiger, the three shapes perhaps
corresponding to the regions of heaven, earth, and hell, or to the three
elements, fire, earth, and water. The deities of many North American
Indian tribes show similar variations in form and colour, which are
supposed to follow as the divinity changes his dwelling to north, south,
east, or west. But Xipe is seldom depicted in the pinturas in any other
form but that of the red od) the form in which the Mexicans adopted him
from the Yopi tribe of the Pacific slope. He is the god of human
sacrifice *par excellence*, and may be regarded as a Yopi equivalent of
Tezcatlipoca.

## Nanaliuatl, or Nanauatzin

Nanahuatl (Poor Leper) presided over skin diseases, such as leprosy. It
was thought that persons afflicted with these complaints were set apart
by the moon for his service. In the Nahua tongue the words for "leprous"
and "eczematous " also mean "divine." The myth of Nanahuatl tells how
before the sun was created humanity dwelt in sable and horrid gloom.
Only a human sacrifice could hasten the appearance of the luminary.
Metztli (The Moon) led forth Nanahuatl as a sacrifice, and he was cast
upon a funeral pyre, in the flames of which he was consumed. Metztli
also cast herself upon the mass of flame, and with her death the sun
rose above the horizon. There can be no doubt that the myth refers to
the consuming of the starry or spotted night, and incidentally to the
nightly death of the moon at the flaming hour of dawn.

## Xolotl

Xolotl is of southern, possibly Zapotec, origin. He represents either
fire rushing down from the heavens or light flaming upward. It is
noticeable that in the ointuras the picture of the setting sun being
devoured by the earth is nearly always placed opposite his image. He is
probably identical with Nanahuatl, and appears as the representative of
human sacrifice. He has also affinities with Xipe. On the whole Xolotl
may be best described as a sun-god of the more southerly tribes. His
head (quaxolvto was one of the most famous devices for warriors' use, as
sacrifice among the Nahua was, as we have seen, closely associated with
warfare.

Xolotl was a mythical figure quite foreign to the peoples of Anahuac or
Mexico, who regarded him as something strange and monstrous. He is
alluded to as the "God of Monstrosities, and, thinks Dr. Seler, the word
"monstrosity" may suitably translate his name. He is depicted with empty
eye-sockets, which circumstance is explained by the myth that when the
gods determined to sacrifice themselves in order to give life and
strength to the newly created sun, Xolotl withdrew, and wept so much
that his eyes fell out of their sockets. This was the Mexican
explanation of a Zapotec attribute. Xolotl was originally the "Lightning
Beast" of the Maya or some other southern folk, and was represented by
them as a dog, since that animal appeared to them to be the creature
which he most resembled. But he was by no means a "natural" dog, hence
their conception of him as unnatural. Dr. Seler is inclined to identify
him with the tapir, and indeed Sahagun speaks of a strange animal-being,
*tlaca-xolotl*, which has "a large snout, large teeth, hoofs like an ox,
a thick hide, and reddish hair"-not a bad description of the tapir of
Central America. Of course to the Mexicans the god Xolotl was no longer
an animal, although he had evolved from one, and was imagined by them to
have the form shown in the accompanying illustration.

## The Fire-God

This deity was known in Mexico under various names, notably Tata (Our
Father), Huehueteotl (Oldest of Gods), and Xiuhtecutli (Lord of the
Year). He was represented as of the colour of fire, with a black face, a
headdress of green feathers, and bearing on his back a yellow serpent,
to typify the serpentine nature of fire. He also bore a mirror of gold
to show his connection with the sun, from which all heat emanates. On
rising in the morning all Mexican families made Xiuhtecutli an offering
of a piece of bread and a drink. He was thus not only, like Vulcan, the
god of thunderbolts and conflagrations, but also the milder deity of the
domestic hearth. Once a year the fire in every Mexican house was
extinguished, and rekindled by friction before the idol of Xiuhtecutli.
When a Mexican baby was born it passed through a baptism of fire on the
fourth day, up to which time a fire, lighted at the time of its birth,
was kept burning in order to nourish its existence.

## Mictlan

Mictlantecutli (Lord of Hades) was God of the Dead and of the grim and
shadowy realm to which the souls of men repair after their mortal
sojourn. He is represented in the *pinturas* as a grisly monster with
capacious mouth, into which fall the spirits of the dead. His terrible
abode was sometimes alluded to as Tlalxicco (Navel of the Earth), but
the Mexicans in general seem to have thought that it was situated in the
far north, which they regarded as a place of famine, desolation, and
death. Here those who by the circumstances of their demise were unfitted
to enter the paradise of Tlaloc-namely, those who had not been drowned
or had not died a warrior's death, or, in the case of women, had not
died in childbed-passed a dreary and meaningless existence. Mictlan was
surrounded by a species of demons called *tzitzimimes*, and had a
spouse, Mictecaciuatl. When we come to discuss the analogous deity of
the Maya we shall see that in all probability Mictlan was represented by
the bat, the animal typical of the underworld. In a preceding paragraph
dealing with the funerary customs we have described thejourney of the
soul to the abode of Mictlan, and the ordeals through which the spirit
of the defunct had to pass ere entering his realm (see p. 37).

## Worship of the Planet Venus

The Mexicans designated the planet Venus Citlalpol (The Great Star) and
Tlauizcalpantecutli (Lord of the Dawn). It seems to have been the only
star worshipped by them, and was regarded with considerable veneration.
Upon its rising they stopped up the chimneys of their houses, so that no
harm of any kind might enter with its light. A column called
Ilhuicatlan, meaning " In the Sky," stood in the court of the great
temple of Mexico, and upon this a symbol of the planet was painted. On
its reappearance during its usual circuit, captives were taken before
this repre. sentation and sacrificed to it. It will be remembered that
the myth of Quetzalcoatl states that the heart of that deity flew upward
from the funeral pyre on which he was consumed and became the planet
Venus. It is not easy to say whether or not this myth is anterior to the
adoption of the worship of the planet by the Nahua, for it may be a tale
of pre- or post-Nahuan growth. In the *tonalamatl* Tlauizcalpantecutli
is representcd as lord of the ninth division of thirteen days, beginning
with Ce Coatl (the sign of "One Serpent "). In several of the *pinturas*
he is represented as having a white body with long red stripes, while
round his eves is a deep black painting like a domino mask, bordered
with small white circles. His lips are a bright vermilion. The red
stripes are probably introduced to accentuate the whiteness of his body,
which is under stood to symbolise the peculiar half-light which emanates
from the planet. The black paint on the face, surrounding the eye,
typifies the dark sky of night. In Mexican and Central American
symbolism the eye often represents light, and here, surrounded by
blackness as it is, it is perhaps almost hieroglyphic. As the star of
evening, Tlauizcalpantecutli is some times shown with the face of a
skull, to signify his descent into the underworld, whither he follows 
the sun. That the Mexicans and Maya carefully and accurately observed
his periods of revolution is witnessed by the *pinturas*.

## Sun-Worship

The sun was regarded by the Nahua, and indeed by all the Mexican and
Central American peoples, as the supreme deity, or rather the principal
source of subsistence and life. He was always alluded to as *the teotl*,
*the* god, and his worship formed as it were a background to that of all
the other gods. His Mexican name, lpalnemohuani (He by whom Men Live)
shows that the Mexicans regarded him as the rimal source of being, and
the heart, the symbol of life, was looked upon as his special sacrifice.
Those who rose at sunrise to prepare food for the day held up to him on
his appearance the hearts of animals they had slain for cooking, and
even the hearts of the victims to Tezcatlipoca and Huitzilopochtli were
first held up to the sun, as if he had a primary right to the sacrifice,
before being cast into the bowl of copal which lay at the feet of the
idol. It was supposed that the luminary rejoiced in offerings of blood,
and that it constituted the only food which would render him
sufficiently vigorous to undertake his daily journey through the
heavens. He is often depicted in the *pinturas* as licking up the gore
of the sacrificial victims with his long tongue-like rays. The sun must
fare well if he was to continue to give life) light, and heat to
mankind.

The Mexicans, as we have already seen, believed that the luminary they
knew had been preceded by others, each of which had been quenched by
some awful cataclysm of nature. Eternity had, in fact, been broken up
into epochs, marked by the destruction of successive suns. In the period
preceding that in whi they lived, a mighty deluge had deprived the sun
of life, and some such catastrophe was apprehended at the end of every
"sheaf" of fifty-two years. The old suns were dead, and the current sun
was no more immortal than they. At the endof oneof the "sheaves" he too
would succumb.

## Sustaining the Sun

It was therefore necessary to sustain the sun by the daily food of human
sacrifice, for by a tithe of human life alone would he be satisfied.
Naturally a people holding such a belief would look elsewhere than
within their own borders for the material wherewith to placate their
deity. This could be most suitably found among the inhabitants of a
neighbouring state. It thus became the business of the warrior class in
the Aztec state to furnish forth the altars of the gods with human
victims. The most suitable district of supply was the pueblo of
Tlaxcallan, or Tlascala, the people of which were of cognate origin to
the Aztecs. The communities had, although related, been separated for so
many generations that they had begun to regard each other as traditional
enemies, and on a given day in the year their forces met at an appointed
spot for the purpose of engaging in a strife which should furnish one
side or the other with a sufficiency of victims for the purpose of
sacrifice. The warrior who captured the largest number of opponents
alive was regarded as the champion of the day, and was awarded the chief
honours of the combat. The sun was therefore the god of warriors, as he
would give them victory in battle in order that they might supply him
with food. The rites of this military worship of the luminary were held
in the Quauhquauhtinchan (House of the Eagles), an armoury set apart for
the regiment of that name. On March 17 and December 1 and 2, at the
ceremonies known as Nauhollin (The Four Motions-alluding to the
quivering appearance of the sun's rays), the warriors gathered in this
hall for the purpose of despatching a messenger to their lord the sun.
High up on the wall of the principal court was a great symbolic
representation of the orb, painted upon a bright coloured cotton
hanging. Before this copal and other Irragrant gums and spices were
burned four times a day. The victim, a war-captive, was placed at the
foot of a long staircase leading up to the Quauhxicalli (Cup of the
Eagles), the name of the stone on which he was to be sacrificed. He was
clothed in red striped with white and wore white plumes in his
hair-colours symbolical of the sun-while he bore a staff decorated with
feathers and a shield covered with tufts of cotton. He also carried a
bundle of eagle's feathers and some paint on his shoulders, to enable
the sun, to whom he was the emissary, to paint his face. He was then
addressed by the officiating priest in the following terms: "Sir, we
pray you go to our god the sun, and greet him on our behalf; tell him
that his sons and warriors and chiefs and those who remain here beg of
him to remember them and to favour them from that place where he is, and
to receive this small offering which we send him. Give him this staff to
help him on his journey, and this shield for his defence, and all the
rest that you have in this bundle." The victim, having undertaken to
carry the message to the sun-god, was then despatched upon his long
journey.

A Quauhxicalli is preserved in the National Museum of Mexico. It
consists of a basaltic mass, circular in form, on which are shown in
sculpture a series of groups representing Mexican warriors receiving the
submission of war-captives. The prisoner tenders a flower to his captor,
symbolical of the life he is about to offer up, for lives were the
"flowers" offered to the gods, and the campaign in which these
"blossoms" were captured was called Xochiyayotl (The War of Flowers).
The warriors who receive the submission of the captives are represented
in the act of tearing the plumes from their heads. These bas-reliefs
occupy the sides of the stone. The face of it is covered by a great
solar disc having eight rays, and the surface is hollowed out in the
middle to form a receptacle for blood-the "cup" alluded to in the name
of the stone. The Quauhxicalli must not be confounded with the
*temalacatl* (spindle stone), to which the alien warrior who received a
chance of life was secured. The gladiatorial combat gave the war-captive
an opportunity to escape through superior address in arms. The
*temalacatl* was somewhat higher than a man, and was provided with a
platform at the top, in the middle of which was placed a great stone
with a hole in it through which a rope was passed. To this the
war-captive was secured, and if he could vanquish seven of his captors
he was released. If he failed to do so he was at once sacrificed.

## A Mexican Valhalla

The Mexican warriors believed that they continued in the service of the
sun after death, and, like the Scandinavian heroes in Valhalla, that
they were admitted to the dwelling of the god, where they shared all the
delights of his diurnal round. The Mexican warrior dreaded to die in his
bed, and craved an end on the field of battle. This explains the
desperate nature of their resistance to the Spaniards under Cortés,
whose officers stated that the Mexicans seemed to desire to die
fighting. After death they believed that they would partake of the
cannibal feasts offered up to the sun and imbibe the juice of flowers.

## The Feast of Totec

The chief of the festivals to the sun was that held in spring at the
vernal equinox, before the representation of a deity known as Totec (Our
Great Chief). Although Totec was a solar deity he had been adopted from
the people of an alien state, the Zapotecs of Zalisco, and is therefore
scarcely to be regarded as the principal sun-god. His festival was
celebrated by the symbolical slaughter of all the other gods for the
purpose of providing sustenance to the sun, each of the gods being
figuratively slain in the person of a victim. Totec was attired in the
same manner as the warrior despatched twice a year to assure the sun of
the loyalty of the Mexicans. The festival appears to have been primarily
a seasonal one, as bunches of dried maize were offered to Totec. But its
larger meaning is obvious. It was, indeed, a commemoration of the
creation of the sun. This is proved by the description of the image of
Totec, which was robed and equipped as the solar traveller, by the solar
disc and tables of the sun's progress carved on the altar employed in
the ceremony, and by the robes of the victims, who were dressed to
represent dwellers in the sun-god's halls. Perhaps Totec, although of
alien origin, was the only deity possessed by the Mexicans who directly
represented the sun. As a borrowed god he would have but a minor
position in the Mexican pantheon, but again as the only sun-god whom it
was necessary to bring into prominence during a strictly solar festival
he would be for the time, of course, a very important deity indeed.

## Tepeyollotl

Tepeyollotl means Heart of the Mountain, and evidently alludes to a
deity whom the Nahua connected with seismic disturbances and
earthquakes. By the interpreter of the Codex Telleriano-Remensis he is
called Tepeolotlec, an obvious distortion of his real name. The
interpreter of the codex states that his name "refers to the condition
of the earth after the flood. The sacrifices of these thirteen days were
not good, and the literal translation of their name is 'dirt
sacrifices.' They caused palsy and bad humours. . . . This Tepeolotlec
was lord of these thirteen days. In them were celebrated the feast to
the Jaguar, and the last four preceding days were days of fasting. . . .
Tepeolotlec means the 'Lord of Beasts.' The four feast days were in
honour of the Suchiquezal, who was the man that remained behind on the
earth upon which we now live. This Tepeolotlec was the same as the echo
of the voice when it re-echoes in a valley from one mountain to another.
This name 'jaguar' is given to the earth because the jaguar is the
boldest animal, and the echo which the voice awakens in the mountains is
a survival of the flood, it is said."

From this we can see that Tepeyollotl is a deity of the earth pure and
simple, a god of desert places. It is certain that he was not a Mexican
god, or at least was not of Nahua origin, as he is mentioned by none of
those writers who deal with Nahua traditions, and we must look for him
among the Mixtecs and Zapotecs.

## Macuilxochitl, or Xochipilli

This deity, whose names mean Five-Flower and Source of Flowers, was
regarded as the patron of luck in gaming. He may have been adopted by
the Nahua from the Zapotecs, but the converse may be equally true. The
Zapotecs represented him with a design resembling a butterfly about the
mouth, and a manycoloured face which looks out of the open jaws of a
bird with a tall and erect crest. The worship of this god appears to
have been very widespread. Sahagun says of him that a *fête* was held in
his honour, which was preceded by a rigorous fast. The people covered
themselves with ornaments and jewels symbolic of the deity, as if they
desired to represent him, and dancing and singing roceeded gaily to the
sound of the drum. Offerings of the blood of various animals followed,
and specially prepared cakes were submitted to the god. This simple
fare, however, was later followed by human sacrifices, rendered by the
notables, who brought certain of their slaves for immolation. This
completed the festival.

## Father and Mother Gods

The Nahua believed that Ometecutli and Omeciuatl were the father and
mother of the human species. The names signify Lords of Duality or Lords
of the Two Sexes. They were also called Tonacatecutli and Tonacaciuatl
(Lord and Lady of Our Flesh, or of Subsistence). They were in fact
regarded as the sexual essence of the creative deity, or perhaps more
correctly of deity in general. They occupied the first place in the
Nahua calendar, to signify that they had existed from the beginning, and
they are usually represented as being clothed in rich attire. Ometecutli
(a literal translation of his name is Two-Lord) is sometimes identified
with the sky and the fire-god, the female deity representing the earth
or water-conceptions similar to those respecting Kronos and Gæa. We
refer again to these supreme divinities in the following chapter (see p.
118).

## The Pulque-Gods

When a man was intoxicated with the native Mexican drink of *pulque*, a
liquor made from the juice of the *Agave Americana*, he was believed to
be under the influence of a god or spirit. The commonest form under
which the drink-god was worshipped was the rabbit, that animal being
considered to be utterly devoid of sense. This particular divinity was
known as Ometochtli. The scale of debauchery which it was desired to
reach was indicated by the number of rabbits worshipped, the highest
number, four hundred, representing the most extreme degree of
intoxication. The chief *pulque*-gods apart from these were Patecatl and
Tequechmecauiani. If the drunkard desired to escape the perils of
accidental hanging during intoxication, it was necessary to sacrifice to
the latter, but if death by drowning was apprehended Teatlahuiani, the
deity who harried drunkards to a watery grave, was placated. If the
debauchee wished his punishment not to exceed a headache, Quatlapanqui
(The Head-splitter) was sacrificed to, or else Papaztac (The Nerveless).
Each trade or profession had its own Ometochtli, but for the aristocracy
there was only one of these gods, Cohuatzincatl, a name signifying "He
who has Grandparents." Several of these drink-gods had names which
connected them with various localities; for example, Tepoxtecatl was the
*pulque*-god of Tepoztlan. The calendar day Ometochtli, which means
"Two-Rabbit," because of the symbol which accompanied it, was under the
special protection of these gods, and the Mexicans believed that any one
born on that day was almost inevitably doomed to become a drunkard. All
the pulque-gods were closely associated with the soil, and with the
earth-goddess. They wore the golden Huaxtec nose-ornament, the
yaca-metztli, of crescent shape, which characterised the latter, and
indeed this ornament was inscribed upon all articles sacred to the
pulque-gods. Their faces were painted red and black, as were objects
consecrated to them, their blankets and shields. After the Indians had
harvested their maize they drank to intoxication, and invoked one or
other of these gods. On the whole it is safe to infer that they were
originally deities of local husbandry who imparted virtue to the soil as
pulque imparted strength and courage to the warrior. The accompanying
sketch of the god Tepoxtecatl (see p. 117) well illustrates the
distinguishing characteristics of the pulque-god class. Here we can
observe the face painted in two colours, the crescent-shaped
nose-ornament, the bicoloured shield, the long necklace made from the
*malinalli* herb, and the ear-pendants.

It is of course clear that the drink-gods were of the same class as the
food-gods-patrons of the fruitful soil-but it is strange that they
should be male whilst the food-gods are mostly female.

## The Goddesses of Mexico: Metztli

Metztli, or Yohualticitl (The Lady of Night), was the Mexican goddess of
the moon. She had in reality two phases, one that of a beneficent
protectress of harvests and promoter of growth in general, and the other
that of a bringer of dampness, cold, and miasmic airs ghosts, mysterious
shapes of the dim half-light of night and its oppressive silence.

To a people in the agricultural stage of civilisation the moon appears
as the great recorder of harvests. But she has also supremacy over
water, which is always connected by primitive peoples with the moon.
Citatli (Moon) and Atl (Water) are constantly confounded in Nahua myth,
and in many ways their characteristics were blended. It was Metztli who
led forth Nanahuatl the Leprous to the pyre whereon he perished-a
reference to the dawn, in which the starry sky of night is consumed in
the fires of the rising sun.

## Tlazolteotl

Tlazolteotl (God of Ordure), or Tlaelquani (Filth-eater), was called by
the Mexicans the earth-goddess because she was the eradicator of sins,
to whose priests the people went to make confession so that they might
be absolved from their misdeeds. Sin was symbolised by the Mexicans as
excrement. Confession covered only the sins of immorality. But if
Tlazolteotl was the goddess of confession, she was also the patroness of
desire and luxury. It was, however, as a deity whose chief office was
the eradication of human sin that she was pre-eminent. The process by
which this was supposed to be effected is quaintly described by Sahagun
in the twelfth chapter of his first book. The penitent addressed the
confessor as follows: "Sir, I desire to approach that most powerful god,
the protector of all, that is to say, Tezcatlipoca. I desire to tell him
my sins in secret." The confessor replied: "Be happy, my son: that which
thou wishest to do will be to thy good and advantage." The confessor
then opened the divinatory book known as the Tonalamatl (that is, the
Book of the Calendar) and acquainted the applicant with the day which
appeared the most suitable for his confession. The day having arrived,
the penitent provided himself with a mat, copal gum to burn as incense,
and wood whereon to burn it. If he was a person high in office the
priest repaired to his house, but in the case of lesser people the
confession took place in the dwelling of the priest. Having lighted the
fire and burned the incense, the penitent addressed the fire in the
following terms: "Thou, lord, who art the father and mother of the gods,
and the most ancient of them all, thy servant, thy slave bows before
thee. Weeping, he approaches thee in great distress. He comes plunged in
grief, because he has been buried in sin, having backslidden, and
partaken of those vices and evil delights which merit death. O master
most compassionate, who art the upholder and defence of all, receive the
penitence and anguish of thy slave and vassal."

This prayer having concluded, the confessor then turned to the penitent
and thus addressed him: "My son, thou art come into the presence of that
god who is the protector and upholder of all; thou art come to him to
confess thy evil vices and thy hidden uncleannesses; thou art come to
him to unbosom the secrets of thy heart. Take care that thou omit
nothing from the catalogue of thy sins in the presence of our lord who
is called Tczcatlipoca. It is certain that thou art before him who is
invisible and impalpable, thou who art not worthy to be seen before him,
or to speak with him. . . ."

The allusions to Tczcatlipoca are, of course, to him in the shape of
Tlazolteotl. Having listened to a sermon by the confessor, the penitent
then confessed his misdeeds, after which the confessor said: "My son,
thou hast before our lord god confessed in his presence thy evil
actions. I wish to say in his name that thou hast an obligation to make.
At the time when the goddesses called Ciuapipiltin descend to earth
during the celebration of the feast of the goddesses of carnal things,
whom they name Ixcuinamc, thou shalt fast during four days, punishing
thy stomach and thy mouth. When the day of the feast of the lxcuinamc
arrives thou shalt scarify thy tongue with the small thorns of the osier
\[called *teocaleacatl* or *tlazotl*\], and if that is not sufficient
thou shalt do likewise to thine ears, the whole for penitence, for the
remission of thy sin, and as a meritorious act. Thou wilt apply to thy
tongue the middle of a spine of magucy, and thou wilt scarify thy
shoulders. That done, thy sins will be pardoned."

If the sins of the penitent were not very grave the priest would enjoin
upon him a fast of more or less prolonged nature. Only old men confessed
crimes *in veneribus*, as the punishment for such was death, and younger
men had no desire to risk the penalty involved, although the priests
were enjoined to strict secrecy.

Father Burgoa describes very fully a ceremony of this kind which came
under his notice in 1652 in the Zapotec village of San Francisco de
Cajonos. He encountered on a tour of inspection an old native *cacique*,
or chief, of great refinement of manners and of a stately presence, who
dressed in costly garments after the Spanish fashion, and who was
regarded by the Indians with much veneration. This man came to the
priest for the purpose of reporting upon the progress in things
spiritual and temporal in his village. Burgoa recognised his urbanity
and wonderful command of the Spanish language, but perceived by certain
signs that he had been taught to look for by long experience that the
man was a pagan. He communicated his suspicions to the vicar of the
village, but met with such assurances of the *cacique's* soundness of
faith that he believed himself to be in error for once. Shortly
afterwards, however, a wandering Spaniard perceived the chief in a
retired place in the mountains performing idolatrous ceremonies, and
aroused the monks, two of whom accompanied him to the spot where the
*cacique* had been seen indulging in his heathenish practices. They
found on the altar "feathers of many colours, sprinkled with blood which
the Indians had drawn from the veins under their tongues and behind
their ears, incense spoons and remains of copal, and in the middle a
horrible stone figure, which was the god to whom they had offered this
sacrifice in expiation of their sins, while they made their confessions
to the blasphemous priests, and cast off their sins in the following
manner: they had woven a kind of dish out of a strong herb, specially
gathered for this purpose, and casting this before the priest, said to
him that they came to beg mercy of their god, and pardon for their sins
that they had committed during that year, and that they brought them all
carefully enumerated. They then drew out of a cloth pairs of thin
threads made of dry maize husks, that they had tied two by two in the
middle with a knot, by which they represented their sins. They laid
these threads on the dishes of grass, and over them pierced their veins,
and let the blood trickle upon them, and the priest took these offerings
to the idol, and in a long speech he begged the god to forgive these,
his sons, their sins which were brought to him, aiid to permit them to
be joyful and hold feasts to him as their god and lord. Then the priest
came back to those who had confessed, delivered a long discourse on the
ceremonies they had still to perform, and told them that the god had
pardoned them and that they might be glad again and sin anew."

## Chalchihuitlicue

This goddess was the wife of Tlaloc, the god of rain and moisture. The
name means Lady of the Emerald Robe, in allusion to the colour of the
element over which the deity partly presided. She was specially
worshipped by the water-carriers of Mexico, and all those whose
avocation brought them into contact with water. Her costume was peculiar
and interesting. Round her neck she wore a wonderful collar of precious
stones, from which hung a gold pendant. She was crowned with a coronet
of blue paper, decorated with green feathers. Her eyebrows were of
turquoise, set in as mosaic, and her garment was a nebulous blue-green
in hue, recalling the tint of seawater in the tropics. The resemblance
was heightened by a border of sea-flowers or water-plants, one of which
she also carried in her left hand, whilst in her right she bore a vase
surmounted by a cross, emblematic of the four points of the compass
whence comes the rain.

## Mixcoatl

Mixcoatl was the Aztec god of the chase, and was probably a deity of the
Otomi aborigines of Mexico. The name means Cloud Serpent, and this
originated the idea that Mixcoatl was a representation of the tropical
whirlwind. This is scarcely correct, however, as the hunter-god is
identified with the tempest and thunder-cloud, and the lightning is
supposed to represent his arrows. Like many other gods of the chase, he
is figured as having the characteristics of a deer or rabbit. He is
usually depicted as carrying a sheaf of arrows, to typify thunderbolts.
It may be that Mixcoatl was an air and thunder deity of the Otomi, older
in origin than either Quetzalcoatl or Tezcatlipoca, and that his
inclusion in the Nahua pantheon becoming necessary in order to quieten
Nahua susceptibilities, he received the status of god of the chase. But,
on the other hand, the Mexicans, unlike the Peruvians, who adopted many
foreign gods for political purposes, had little regard for the feelings
of other races, and only accepted an alien deity into the native circle
for some good reason, most probably because they noted the omission of
the figure in their own divine system. Or, again, dread of a certain
foreign god might force them to adopt him as their own in the hope of
placating him. Their worship of Quetzalcoatl is perhaps an instance of
this.

## Camaxtli

This deity was the war-god of the Tlascalans, who were constantly in
opposition to the Aztecs of Mexico. He was to the warriors of Tlascala
practically what Huitzilopochtli was to those of Mexico. He was closely
identified with Mixcoatl, and with the god of the morning star, whose
colours are depicted on his face and body. But in all probability
Camaxtli was a god of the chase, who in later times was adopted as a god
of war because of his possession of the lightning dart, the symbol of
divine warlike prowess. In the mythologies of North America we find
similar hunter-gods, who sometimes evolve into gods of war for a like
reason, and again gods of the chase who have all the appearance and
attributes of the creatures hunted.

## Ixtlilton

Ixtlilton (The Little Black One) was the Mexican god of medicine and
healing, and therefore was often alluded to as the brother of
Macuilxochitl, the god of well-being or good luck. From the account of
the general appearance of his temple-in edifice of painted boards-it
would seem to have evolved from the primitive tent or lodge of the
medicine-man, or *shaman*. It contained several water-jars called
*tlilatl* (black water), the contents of which were administered to
children in bad health. The parents of children who benefited from the
treatment bestowed a feast on the deity, whose idol was carried to the
residence of the grateful father, where ceremonial dances and oblations
were made before it. It was then thought that Ixtlilton descended to the
courtyard to open fresh jars of *pulque* liquor provided for the
feasters, and the entertainment concluded by an examination by the Aztec
Æsculapius of such of the *pulque* jars dedicated to his service as
stood in the courtyard for everyday use. Should these be found in an
unclean condition, it was understood that the master of the house was a
man of evil life, and he was presented by the priest with a mask to hide
his face from his scoffing friends.

## Omacatl

Omacatl was the Mexican god of festivity and joy. The name signifies Two
Reeds. He was worshipped chiefly by bon-vivants and the rich, who
celebrated him in splendid feasts and orgies. The idol of the deity was
invariably placed in the chamber where these functions were to take
place, and the Aztecs were known to regard it as a heinous offence if
anything derogatory to the god were performed during the convivial
ceremony, or if any omission were made from the prescribed form which
these gatherings usually took. It was thought that if the host had been
in any way remiss Omacatl would appear to the startled guests, and in
tones of great severity upbraid him who had given the feast, intimating
that he would regard him no longer as a worshipper and would henceforth
abandon him. A terrible malady, the symptoms of which were akin to those
of falling-sickness, would shortly afterwards seize the guests; but as
such symptoms are not unlike those connected with acute indigestion and
other gastric troubles, it is probable that the gourmets who paid homage
to the god of good cheer may have been suffering from a too strenuous
instead of a lukewarm worship of him. But the idea of communion which
underlay so many of the Mexican rites undoubtedly entered into the
worship of Omacatl, for prior to a banquet in his honour those who took
part in it formed a great bone out of maize paste, pretending that it
was one of the bones of the deity whose merry rites they were about to
engage in. This they devoured, washing it down with great draughts of
*pulque*. The idol of Omacatl was provided with a recess in the region
of the stomach, and into this provisions were stuffed. He was
represented as a squatting figure, painted black and white, crowned with
a paper coronet, and hung with coloured paper. A flower-fringed cloak
and sceptre were the other symbols of royalty worn by this Mexican
Dionysus.

## Opochtli

Opochtli (The Left-handed) was the god sacred to fishers and
bird-catchers. At one period of Aztec history he must have been a deity
of considerable consequence, since for generations the Aztecs were
marsh-dwellers and depended for their daily food on the fish netted in
the lakes and the birds snared in the reeds. They credited the god with
the invention of the harpoon or trident for spearing fish and the
fishing-rod and bird-net. The fishermen and bird-catchers of Mexico held
on occasion a special feast in honour of Opochtli, at which a certain
liquor called *octli* was consumed. A procession was afterwards formed,
in which marched old people who had dedicated themselves to the worship
of the god, probably because they could obtain no other means of
subsistence than that afforded by the vocation of which he was tutelar
and patron. He was represented, as a man painted black, his head
decorated with the plumes of native wild birds, and crowned by a paper
coronet in the shape of a rose. He was clad in green paper which fell to
the knee, and was shod with white sandals. In his left hand he held a
shield painted red, having in the centre a white flower with four petals
placed crosswise, and in his right hand he held a sceptre in the form of
a cup.

## Yacatecutli

Yacatecutli was the patron of travellers of the merchant class, who
worshipped him by piling their staves together and sprinkling on the
heap blood from their noses and ears. The staff of the traveller was his
symbol, to which prayer was made and ofFerings of flowers and incense
tendered.

## The Aztec Priesthood

The Aztec priesthood was a hierarchy in whose hands resided a goodly
portion of the power of the upper classes est)ecially that connected
with education and endowment. The mere fact that its members possessed
the power of selecting victims for sacrifice must have been sufficient
to place them in an almost unassailable position, and their prophetic
utterances, founded upon the art of divination-so great a feature in the
life of the Aztec people, who depended upon it from the cradle to the
grave-probably assisted them in maintaining their hold upon the popular
imagination. But withal the evidence of unbiased Spanish ecclesiastics,
such as Sahagun, tends to show that they utilised their influence for
good, and soundly instructed the people under their charge in the
cardinal virtues; "in short," says the venerable friar, "to perform the
duties plainly pointed out by natural religion."

## Priestly Revenues

The establishment of the national religion was, as in the case of the
mediæval Church in Europe, based upon a land tenure from which the
priestly class derived a substantial though, considering their numbers,
by no means inordinate revenue. The principal temples possessed lands
which sufficed for the maintenance of the priests attached to them.
There was, besides, a system of first-fruits fixed by law for the
priesthood, the surplusage therefrom being distributed among the poor.

## Education

Education was entirely conducted by the priesthood, which undertook the
task in a manner highly creditable to it, when consideration is given to
surrounding conditions. Education was, indeed, highly organised. It was
divided into primary and secondary grades. Boys were instructed by
priests, girls by holy women or "nuns." The secondary schools were
called *calmecac*, and were devoted to the higher branches of education,
the curriculum including the deciphering of the *pinturas*, or
manuscripts, astrology and divination, with a wealth of religious
instruction.

## Orders of the Priesthood

At the head of the Aztec priesthood stood the Mexicatl Teohuatzin
(Mexican Lord of Divine Matters). He had a seat on the emperor's
council, and possessed power which was second only to the royal
authority. Next in rank to him was the highpriest of Quetzalcoatl, who
dwelt in almost entire seclusion, and who had authority over his own
caste only. This office was in all probability a relic from "Toltec"
times. The priests of Quetzalcoatl were called by name after their
tutelar deity. The lesser grades included the Tlenamacac (Ordinary
Priests), who were habited in black, and wore their hair long, covering
it with a kind of mantilla. The lowest order was that of the Lamacazton
(Little Priests), youths who were graduating in the priestly office.

## An Exacting Ritual

The priesthood enjoyed no easy existence, but led an austere life of
fasting, penance, and prayer, with constant observance of an arduous and
exacting ritual, which embraced sacrifice, the upkeep of perpetual
fires, the chanting of holy songs to the gods, dances, and the
superintendence of the ever-recurring festivals. They were required to
rise during the night to render praise, and to maintain themselves in a
condition of absolute cleanliness by means of constant ablutions. We
have seen that blood-offering-the substitution of the part for the
whole-was a common method of sacrifice, and in this the priests engaged
personally on frequent occasions. If the caste did not spare the people
it certainly did not spare itself, and its outlook was perhaps only a
shade more gloomy and fanatical than that of the Spanish hierarchy which
succeeded it in the land.
