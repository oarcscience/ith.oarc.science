### How the great Glooskap fought the Giant Sorcerers at Saco, and turned them into Fish.

(Penobscot.)

*N'karnayoo*, of old times: *Woodenit atok hagen* 

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Glusgahbe*. This
is a story of Glooskap (P.). There was a father who had three sons and a
daughter: they were *m'téoulin*, or mighty magicians; they were giants;
they ate men, women, and children; they did everything that was wicked
and horrible; and the world grew tired of them and of all their
abominations. Yet when this family was young, Glooskap had been their
friend; he had made the father his adopted father, the brothers his
brothers, the sister his sister. <span id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_81.md) Yet
as they grew older, and he began to hear on every side of their
wickedness, he said: "I will go among them and find if this be true. And
if it be so, they shall die. I will not spare one of those who oppress
and devour men, I do not care who he may be."

This family was at *Samgadihawk*, or Saco, on the sandy field which is
in the Intervale or the summer bed of the Saco River, in the
El-now-e-bit, the White Mountains, between Geh-sit-wah-zuch <span
id="fr_82"></span>[2](#fn_82.md) and K'tchee penahbesk, <span
id="fr_83"></span>[3](#fn_83.md) and near Oonahgemessuk weegeet, the Home
of the Water Fairies. <span id="fr_84"></span>[4](#fn_84.md)

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

Now the old man, the father of the evil magicians and his adopted
father, had only one eye, and was half gray. <span
id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_85.md) And Glooskap made himself like him,--there
was not between them the difference of a hair; and having this form, he
entered the wigwam and sat down by the old man. And the brothers, who
killed everybody, not sparing one living soul, bearing a talking, looked
in slyly, and seeing the new-comer, so like their father that they knew
not which was which, said, "This is a great magician. But he shall be
tried ere he goes, and that bitterly."

Then the sister took the tail of a whale, and cooked it for the stranger
to eat. But as it lay before him, on the platter and on his knees, the
elder brother entered, and saying rudely, "This is too good for a beggar
like you," took it away to his own wigwam. Then Glooskap spoke: "That
which was given to me was mine; therefore I take it again." And sitting
still he simply wished for it, and it came flying into the platter where
it was before. So he ate it.

Then the brothers said, "Indeed, he is a great magician. But he shall be
tried ere he goes, and that bitterly."

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

When he had eaten, they brought in a mighty bone, the jaw of a whale,
and the eldest brother, with great ado, and using both his arms and all
his strength, bent it a little. Then he handed it to Glooskap, who with
his thumb and fingers snapped it like a pipe-stem. And the brothers said
again, "Truly, this is a great magician. But he shall for all that be
tried ere he goes, and that bitterly."

Then they brought a great pipe full of the strongest tobacco; no man not
a magician could have smoked it. And it was passed round: every one
smoked; the brothers blew the smoke through their nostrils. But Glooskap
filled it full, and, lighting it, burnt all the tobacco to ashes at one
pull, and blew all the smoke through his nostrils at one puff. Then the
brothers said again in anger, "This is indeed a great magician. Yet he
shall be tried again ere he goes, and that bitterly." But they never
said it again.

And they still tried to smoke with him, and the wigwam was closed; they
hoped to smother him in smoke, but he sat and puffed away as if he had
been on a mountain-top, till they could bear it no longer. And one said,
"This is idle; let us go and play at ball." The place where they were to
play was on the sandy plain of Samgadihawk, or Saco, on the bend of the
river. <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86.md) And the game begun; but
Glooskap found that the ball with which they played was a hideous skull;
it was alive and snapped at his heels, and had

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

he been as other men and it had bitten him, it would have taken his foot
off. Then Glooskap laughed, and said, "So this is the game you play.
Good, but let us all play with our own balls." So he stepped up to a
tree on the edge of the river-bed and broke off the end of a bough, and
it turned into a skull ten times more terrible than the other. And the
magicians ran before it as it chased them as a lynx chases rabbits; they
were entirely beaten. Then Glooskap stamped on the sand, and the waters
rose and came rushing fearfully from the mountains adown the river-bed;
the whole land rang with their roar. Now Glooskap sang a magic song,
which changes all beings, and the three brothers and their father became
the *chinahmess*, a fish which is as long and large as a man, and they
went headlong down on the flood, to the deep sea, to dwell there
forever. And the magicians had on, each of them, a wampum collar;
wherefore the *chinahmess* has beneath its head, as one may say, round
its neck, the wampum collar, as may be seen to this day. And they were
mighty *m'téoulin* in their time; but they were tried before they went,
and that bitterly.

Yes, *seewass*, my brother, this is a true story. For Glus-gah-be was a
great man in his day, and the day will come when I shall go to him and
see him. <span id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_87.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_81"></span>[123:1](al29.htm#fr_81.md) The Indians make formal
adoptions of relatives of every grade, and in addition to this use all
the terms of relationship as friendly greetings. This is in fact made
apparent in all the stories in this collection.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[123:2](al29.htm#fr_82.md) *Geh-sit-wah-zuch*,
"many mountains" (Pen.). Mount Kearsarge, so called from the several
lesser peaks around it.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[123:3](al29.htm#fr_83.md) *K'tchee penabesk*, "the
great rock," a much more sensible and appropriate name than that of
"Cathedral Rocks," which has been bestowed upon it; also *chee penabsk*.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[123:4](al29.htm#fr_84.md) Also called from a
legend, *Oonahgemessuk k'tubbee*, the Water Fairies' Spring. This
appropriate and beautiful name has been <span id="page_124">p.
124</span> rejected in favor of the ridiculously rococo term "Diana's
Bath." As there is a "Diana's Bath "at almost every summer watering
place in America, North Conway must of course have one. The absolute
antipathy which the majority of Americans manifest for the aboriginal
names, even in a translation, is really remarkable.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[124:1](al29.htm#fr_85.md) This would directly
connect him with the beings which are half stone, like the
Oonahgemessuk, or water-goblins, the dwellers in Katahdin, and the
Eskimo elves. This will be referred to again.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[125:1](al29.htm#fr_86.md) I have an Indian stone
pestle, or hominy pounder, which I picked up on the site of this
ball-play.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[126:1](al29.htm#fr_87.md) This legend is from a
single authority, Maria Saksis.
