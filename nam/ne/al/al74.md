### The Giant Magicians.

There was once a man and his wife who lived by the sea, far away from
other people. They had many children, and they were very poor. One day
this couple were in their canoe, far from land. There came up a dense
fog; they were quite lost.

They heard a noise as of paddles and voices. It drew nearer. They saw
dimly a monstrous canoe filled with giants, who greeted the little folk
like friends. "*Uch keen, tahmee wejeaok*?" "My little brother," said
the leader, "where are you going?" "I am lost in the fog," said the poor
Indian, very sadly. "Ah, come with us to our camp," said the giant, who
seemed to be a good fellow, if there ever was one. "Truly, ye will be
well treated, my small friends, for my father is the chief; so be of
good cheer!" And they, being much amazed at this gentleness, sat still
in awe, while two of the giants, each putting a tip of his paddle under
their bark, lifted it up and put it into their own, as if it had been a
chip. And truly the giants seemed to be as much pleased with the little
folk as a boy would be who had found a flying squirrel. <span

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

And as they drew near the beach, lo! they beheld three wigwams, high as
mountains, in size according to that of the giants. And coming to meet
them was the chief, who was taller than the rest.

"Ha!" he cried. "Son, what have you there? Where did you pick up that
little brother? Noo, my father, I found him lost in the fog." "Well,
bring him home to the lodge, my son!" So the giant took the small canoe
in the palm of his hand, the man and his wife sitting therein, and
carried them home. Then they were taken into the wigwam, and the canoe
was laid carefully in the eaves, but within easy reach, about a hundred
and fifty yards from the ground.

Then an abundant meal was set before them, but the benevolent host,
mindful of their small size, did not give them more to eat than they
would have needed for about ten years to come, and informed them in a
subdued whisper, which could hardly have been heard a hundred miles off,
that his name was Oscoon. <span id="fr_207"></span>[1](#fn_207)

Now it came to pass, a few days after, that a company of these
well-grown people went hunting, and when they returned the guests must
needs pity them that they had no game in their land which answered to
their size; for they came in with strings of such small affairs as two
or three dozen caribou hanging in their belts, as a Micmac would carry a
string of

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

squirrels, and swinging one or two moose in their hands like rabbits.
Yet, what with these and many deer, bears, and beavers, they made up in
the weight of their game what it lacked in size, and of what they had
they were generous.

Now the giants became very fond of the small folk, and would not for the
world that they should in any way come to harm. And it came to pass that
one morning the chief told them that they were to have a grand battle,
since they expected in three days to be attacked by a Chenoo. Therefore
the Micmac saw that in all things it was even with the giants as with
his own people at home, they having their troubles with the wicked, and
the chiefs their share in being obliged to keep up their magic and know
all that was going on in the world. Yea, for he would be a poor *powwow*
and a necromancer worth nothing who could not foretell such a trifle as
the day and hour when an enemy would be on them!

But this time the Sakumow (M.), or sagamore, was forewarned, and bade
his little guests stop their ears and bind up their heads, and roll
themselves in many folds of dressed skins, lest they should hear the
deadly war-scream of the Chenoo. And with all their care they hardly
survived it; but the second scream hurt them less; and after the third
the chief came to them with a cheerful countenance, and bade them arise
and unpack themselves, for the monster was slain, and though his four
sons, with two other giants, had been sorely tried, yet they had
conquered.

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

But the sorrows of the good are never at an end, and so it was with
these honest giants, who were always being pestered with some kind of
scurvy knaves or others; who would not leave them in peace. For anon the
chief announced that this time a Kookwes--a burly, beastly villain, not
two points better than his cousin the Chenoo--was coming to play at
rough murder with them. And, verily, by this time the Micmac began to
believe, without bating an ace on it, that all of these tall people were
like the wolves, who, meeting with nobody else, bite one another. So
they were bound and bundled up as before, and put to bed like dolls. And
again they heard the horrible shout, the moderate shout, and the smaller
shout, until *sooel moonoodooahdigool*, which, being interpreted,
meaneth that they hardly heard him at all.

Then the warriors, returning, gave proof that they had indeed done
something more than kick the wind, for they were covered with blood, and
their legs were stuck full of large pines, with here and there an oak or
hemlock, for the fight had been in a forest; so that they had been as
much troubled as men would be with thistles, nettles, and pine
splinters, which is truly often a great trouble. But this was their
least trial, for, as they told their chief, the enemy had well-nigh made
Jack Drum's entertainment for them, and led them the devil's dance, had
not one of them, by good luck, opened his eye for him with a rock which
drove it into his brain. And as it was, the chief's youngest son had
been so mauled that, coming home, he fell

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

dead Just before his father's door. Truly this might have been deemed
almost an accident in some families; but lo! what a good thing it is to
have an enchanter in the house, especially one who knows his business,
as did the old chief, who, going out, asked the young man why he was
lying there. To which he replying that it was because he was dead, his
father bade him rise and walk, which he did straight to the supper
table, and ate none the less for it.

Now the old chief, thinking that perhaps his dear little people found
life dull and devoid of incident with him, asked them if they were
aweary of him. They, with golden truth indeed, answered that they had
never been so merry, but that they were anxious as to their children at
home. He answered that they were indeed right, and that the next morning
they might depart. So their canoe was reached down for them, and packed
full of the finest furs and best meat, when they were told to
*tebah'-dikw'*, or get in. Then a small dog was put in, and this dog was
solemnly charged that he should take the people home, while the people
were told to paddle in the direction in which the dog should
point. <span id="fr_208"></span>[1](#fn_208) And to the Micmac he said,
"Seven years hence you will be reminded of me." And then *tokooboosijik*
(off they went).

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

The man sat in the stern, his wife in the prow, and the dog in the
middle of the canoe. The dog pointed, the Indian paddled, the water was
smooth. They soon reached home; the children with joy ran to meet them;
the dog as joyfully ran to see the children, wagging his tail with great
glee, just as if he had been like any other dog, and not a fairy. For,
having made acquaintance, he without delay turned tail and trotted off
for home again, running over the ocean surface as if it had been hard
ice; which might, indeed, have once astonished the good man and his
wife, but they had of late days seen so many wonders that they were past
marveling.

Now this Indian, who had in the past been always poor, seemed to have
quite recovered from that complaint. When he let down his lines the
biggest fish bit; all his sprats were salmon; he prayed for goslings,
and got geese; moose were as mice to him now; yea, he had the best in
the land, with all the fatness thereof. So seven years passed away, and
then, as he slept, there came unto him divers dreams, and in them he
went back to the Land of the Giants, and saw all those who had been so
kind to him. And yet again he dreamed one night that he was standing by
his wigwam near the sea,--and that a great whale swam up to him and
began to sing, and that the singing was the sweetest he had ever heard.

Then he remembered that the giant had told him he would think of him in
seven years; and it came clearly before him what it all meant, and that
he was

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

erelong to have magical power given to him, and that he should become a
*Megumoowessoo*. This he told his wife, who, not being learned in
darksome lore, would fain know more nearly what kind of a being he
expected to be, and whether a spirit or a man, good or bad; which was,
indeed, not easy to explain, nor is it clearly set down in the
chronicles beyond this,--that, whatever it might be, it was all for the
best, and that there was a great deal of magic in it.

That day they saw a great shark cruising about in their bay, chasing
fish, and this they held for an evil omen. But, soon after, there came
trotting towards them over the sea the same small dog who had been their
pilot from the Land of the Giants. So he, full of joy, as before, at
seeing them and the children, wagged his tail and danced for glee, and
then looked earnestly at the man as if for some message. And to him the
man said, "It is well. In three years' time I will make you a visit. I
will look to the southwest." Then the dog licked the hands and the ears
and the eyes of the man, and went home as before over the sea, running
on the water.

And when the three years had passed the Indian entered his canoe, and,
paddling without fear, found his way to the Land of the Giants. He saw
the wigwams standing on the beach; the immense canoes were drawn up on
the water's edge; from afar he beheld the old giant coming down to
welcome him. But he was alone. And when he had been welcomed, and was in
the wigwam, he learned that all the sons were dead.

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They had died
three years before, when the shark, the great sorcerer, had been seen.

They had gone, and the old man had but lingered a little longer. They
had made the magic change, they had departed, and he would soon join
them *in his own kingdom*. But ere he went he would leave their great
inheritance, their magic, to the man.

Therewith the giant brought out his son's clothes, and bade the Indian
put them on. Truly this was as if he had been asked to clothe himself
with a great house, since the smallest fold in them would have been to
him as a cavern. But he stepped in, and as he did this he rose to great
size; he filled out the garments till they fitted; he was a giant, of
Giant-Land. With the clothes came the wisdom, the *m'téoulin*, the
*manitou* power of the greatest and wisest of the olden time. He was
indeed *Megumoowessoo*, and had attained to the Mystery.

 

This very remarkable and evidently ancient tale is one of that kind
which the keepers of tribe chronicles among the pagan Indians do not
tell to the world, and which they conceal from white men. It is not a
fragment, nor is it unfinished, as some readers may suppose. Its plot is
of a much higher nature than a novel, which ends in a marriage. To an
Indian, whose ideas of earthly happiness were not in money, houses, and
lands, personal power was the one thing to be most desired. As a
Passamaquoddy said once to me, "To be rich in those days meant to be a
great hunter and

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

always have plenty of meat for everybody." Hence the desire to be great
and strong to be able to entice wild animals, to run like the wind, to
be crafty in all things, especially in making war; hence to have
prophetic dreams. All of this was to be attained by *m'téoulin*, or
magic. The highest ambition of an Indian was to become a
*Megumoowessoo*, a mystical being, which is explained differently as
fairy, faun, sylvan deity, but which means one who enjoys all the
highest privileges of humanity allied to the supernatural. This is what
the hero of this story gets by favor of the giant.

It may be observed that in this tale the Indian cannot explain to his
wife what he nevertheless perfectly understands; that is, the exact
nature of a *Megumoowessoo*. The giant, by speaking of his own kingdom,
gives the true key of the whole mystery. He has attained magic power so
far as one can exercise it in this life. Like Glooskap he can be, or
unlike him prefers to be habitually, a giant. He has battled with the
Chenoo and Kookwess; he has, like Hercules, fulfilled his mission; and
now he departs for his own realm, that of the *Megumoowessoo*, as Arthur
went to Fairy-Land, as Buddha to the unknown Nirvana,--that is, to
something beyond the conception of poet or theosophist.

I suspect that the period of seven years, and again of three years, had
been employed by the Indian in preparing himself by penance for
*m'téoulin*. The respect of the Indians for the number *seven* is so

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

remarkable, that if it be true that *Deus imparibus numeris gaudet*,
they are in that respect, at least, like deities. Whenever *seven* or a
white bear's skin occurs in these tiles, there always lies hidden a
magical mystery.

It is not the least remarkable feature of this tale that it abounds in
that quiet small humor which recalls the adventures of Captain Lemuel
Gulliver. The Indian, like the Norseman, was such an *implicit* believer
in his own myths, and he had evolved them so entirely from himself
without borrowing,--since we may regard him as one in this respect with
the Eskimo,--that no human characteristic detracted from the dignity of
the Manitou.

There is a strong suggestion in this story that the giants were whales.
This and the incident of their inhabiting a mysterious country beyond
the sea and the fog would identify them with the enchanted land of the
Eskimo, visited by the Angakok in their trances, and by others in
*kayaks*. This country was named *Akilinek*, "a fabulous land beyond the
sea." The whole story of Malaise, the man who traveled to Akilinek, is
in every detail extremely like an Indian tale. (Rink, page 169.) It has
also a Norse affinity. The land of the giants was supposed by both
Icelanders and Indians to be in the North Atlantic. There is a Norse
tale of a man changed to a whale which indicates a common origin with
the one here given.

It is believed that the *m'téoulin* can, when speaking, make themselves
heard to whom they will, at any

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

distance. They can confer with one another secretly when miles away, or
make themselves known to many. I was informed by an Indian in all faith
that an old witch who died in 1876, twelve miles from Pleasant Point,
was heard to speak in the latter place when at her last. A very
intelligent Passamaquoddy told me that when Osalik (Sarah) Hequin died
he himself heard all she said, though sixty-five miles distant. I am
certain that he firmly believed this. This woman died a strange death,
for she was found standing up, dead, in the snow, with her arms extended
and "hands sticking out." It is generally believed that she was killed
by other *m'téoulin*.

There are really very few ideas in modern mesmerism not known to Eskimo
or Indian Shamans. Clairvoyance is called by the Passamaquoddies *Meelah
bi give he*.

THE SONG OF THE STARS.

We are the stars which sing,  
We sing with our light;  
We are the birds of fire,  
We fly over the sky.  
Our light is a voice;  
We make a road for spirits,  
For the spirits to pass over.  
Among us are three hunters  
Who chase a bear;  
There never was a time  
When they were not hunting.  
We look down on the mountains.  
This is the Song of the Stars.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_206"></span>[368:1](al74.htm#fr_206) A story like this of
giants in a canoe would very naturally originate about the Bay of Fundy,
where, in the dense and frequent fogs, all objects assume greatly
exaggerated apparent dimensions. One often beholds there, on the shore,
"men as trees walking."

<span id="fn_207"></span>[369:1](al74.htm#fr_207) Mr. Rand suggests that
this may indicate the dark color of his tribe. Eskimo legends speak of
people among them who were black.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[372:1](al74.htm#fr_208) Strange as it may
seem, there is not the least exaggeration in this. Lieutenant-Colonel
Barclay Kennan told me that when surveying in the far North Pacific he
had an Eskimo dog which, in the thickest fog, would scent the land at a
great distance, and continually point to it.

Tumbling end over end, goes Piel to *mercess*,  
With feathers on his eyes.  
To the maple-sap ridge *we are going*,  
Our lunch a cod-fish skin;  
*One est* Molly's daughter goes with us.
