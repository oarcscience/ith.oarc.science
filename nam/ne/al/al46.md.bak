### V. How Master Rabbit went to a Wedding and won the Bride.

(Passamaquoddy.)

Chee mahtigwess, or the Great Rabbit, was once very stout or large of
body, having a very long tail. And one day in the old times, as he sat
on the rock, with his fine long tail trailing afar into the bushes, an
old man came by who asked the way. And Master Rabbit, being as usual
obliging offered to show it to him. So they talked together and grew
intimate, but as the old man went very slowly, while Rabbit was always
running, he said, "Go on before, and I will follow." So the guide was
soon out of sight, and then the old man, hurrying without heeding, fell
down into a deep pit or chasm, where he cried out aloud for help, but
was not heard. After a time, Rabbit, missing his follower, turned back
and tracked him till he found the pit. Yet they could not between them
manage to bring the traveler up again, until Rabbit said, "Catch hold of
my tail;" and when this was done he gave a jump, but alas! the fine tail
broke off short within an inch of the root.

One would think that by this time Master Rabbit must have had enough of
helping, but all the stories of him show that he never gave up anything
which he had once begun. So he simply said to the old man, "Catch hold
of me round the waist;" and when this was done he gave another leap, and
brought the prisoner out. But the man, being heavy, had

slipped down, and almost broken Rabbit's back. So it came to pass that
since that day Master Rabbit has had a very short tail and a slender
waist.

The old man was on his way to marry a young girl. But she was in love
with Mikumwess, the forest fairy. However, the old man married her, and
invited Master Rabbit to the dance, which in old times made the
ceremony. And the guest dressed for the occasion by putting ear-rings on
his heels--for Rabbits or Hares dance on their tip-toes--and a beautiful
bangle round his neck, and he danced opposite the bride. Now the bride
had on only a very short skirt, and in crossing a brook it had got wet.
So that as she danced, it began to shrink and shrink, until Master
Rabbit, pitying the poor girl, ran out and got a deer-skin, and hastily
twisted a cord to tie it with. But it seemed as if Master Rabbit's
efforts to oblige people always got him into trouble, for he twisted
this string so rapidly and earnestly, holding one end of it in his teeth
as he did so, that he cut his upper lip through to the nose, for which
reason his descendants all have harelips to this day.

Now having dressed the bride, she was so grateful to Rabbit that she
danced with him all the night. The old man, seeing this, was so angry at
her fickleness that, without saying a word, he walked away, and left her
to Mahtigwess, with whom she lived very happily until she ran away with
Mikumwess; with whom, if she has not run away again, she is living yet.
This story is at an end.
