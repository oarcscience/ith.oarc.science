### How a Certain Wicked Witch sought to cajole the Great and Good Glooskap, and of her Punishment.

(Micmac.)

*N'karnayoo*, of old time. Once it came to pass that Glooskap met with
an evil witch, and she had made herself like unto a fair young girl, and
believed that he could not know who she was. And she asked him to take
her with him in his canoe. So they sailed out over a summer sea: and as
they went the witch

sought to beguile him with sweet words; but he answered naught, for he
wist well what kind of passenger he had on board. And as they went on
she played her cajoleries, but he remained grim as a bear. Then she,
being angry, showed it, and there arose a great storm. The wind howled
over the waves as they rose and fell, like white wolves jumping while
they run, the first lightnings flashed, and the sky grew dark as night.
The Master was angered that so mean a creature dared to play him such
tricks, and, paddling the canoe to the beach, he leaped ashore. Then
giving the bark, with the witch in it, a push out to sea, he cried to
her, "Sail thou with the devil! But never be in human form again, O
she-beast!"

Then she, being frightened, said, "Master, what wilt thou that I
become?" And he replied, "Whatever thou wilt; that grace alone I give
thee." And in despair she plunged into the waters, and became a
*keegunibe*, a ferocious fish, which has upon its back a great fin,
which it shows like a sail when swimming through the water. So the canoe
and the witch became one in the evil fish, and the Indians to this day
when they see it, cry, "See the witch, who was punished by the great
Master!"

Now of sinful men, evil beasts, foul sorcerers, witches, and giants,
there were in those days many who sought to do great harm to Glooskap;
but of them all there did not escape any; verily, no, not one. <span
