### Of the Woman who married the Thunder, and of their Boy.

(Passamaquoddy.)

Once a woman went to the edge of a lake <span
id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_157.md) and lay down to sleep. As she awoke, she
saw a great serpent, with glittering eyes, crawl from the water, and
stealthily approach her. She had no power to resist his embrace. After
her return to her people her condition betrayed itself, and she was much
persecuted; they pursued her with sticks and stones, howling abuse.

She fled from the village; she went afar into wild places, and, sitting
down on the grass, wept, wishing that she were dead. As she sat and
wailed, a very beautiful girl, dressed in silver and gold, <span
id="fr_158"></span>[2](#fn_158.md) appeared, and after listening to her sad
story said, "Follow me!"

Then they went up on high into a mountain, through three rocks, until
they came into a pleasant wigwam with a very smooth floor. An old man,
so old that

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

he was all white, came to meet them. Then he, taking a short stick, bade
her dance. He began to sing, and as he sang she gave birth, one by one,
to twelve serpents. These the old man killed in succession with his
stick as they were born. Then she had become thin again, and was in her
natural form.

The old man had a son, Badawk, the Thunder, and a daughter,
*Psawk-tankapic*, the Lightning, and when Thunder returned he offered to
take her back to her own people, but she refused to go. Then the old man
said to his son, "Take her for your wife and be good to her." So they
were married.

In time she bore a son. When the boy could stand, the old man, who never
leaves the mountain, called him to stand before him, while he fastened
wings to the child. He was soon able, with these wings, to make a noise,
which greatly pleased the grandfather. When a storm is approaching, the
distant rumbling is the muttering thunder made by the child, but it is
*Badawk*, his father, who comes in the dark cloud and makes the roaring
crash, while *Psawk-tankapic* flashes her lightnings.

In after days, when the woman visited her people, she told them that
they never need fear the thunder or lightning.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_157"></span>[266:1](al55.htm#fr_157.md) It is impossible to
distinguish in any Indian story between lake and sea.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[266:2](al55.htm#fr_158.md) Both silver and gold
were known in pre-Columbian times to the Indians. I had a cousin who
once found a very old stone pipe in which a small piece of gold had been
set. Particles of gold are found in many mountain-streams in New
England.
