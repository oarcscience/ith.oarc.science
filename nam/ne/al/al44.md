### III. Of the Adventure with Mooin, the Bear; it being the Third and Last Time that Master Rabbit made a Fool of himself.

Now, truly, one would think that after all that had befallen Master
*Mahtigwess*, the Rabbit, that he would have had enough of trying other
people's trades; but his nature was such that, having once set his
mighty mind to a thing, little short of sudden death would cure him. And
being one day with the Bear in his cave, he beheld with great wonder how
*Mooin* fed his folk. For, having put a great pot on the fire, he did
but cut a little slice from his own foot and drop it into the boiling
water, when it spread and grew into a mess of meat which served for
all. <span id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_122) Nay, there was a great piece
given to Rabbit to take home to feed his family.

"Now, truly," he said, "this is a thing which I can indeed do. Is it not
recorded in the family wampum that whatever a Bear can do well a Rabbit
can do better?" So, in fine, he invited his friend to come and dine with
him, *Ketkewopk'*, the day after to-morrow.

And the Bear being there, Rabbit did but say, "*Noogume' kuesawal'
wohu*!" "Grandmother, set your pot to boiling!" And, whetting his knife
on a

stone, he tried to do as the Bear had done; but little did he get from
his small, thin soles, though he cut himself madly and sadly.

"What can he be trying to do?" growled the guest.

"Ah!" sighed the grandmother, "something which he has seen some one else
do."

"Ho! I say there! Give me the knife," quoth Bruin. And, getting it, he
took a slice from his sole, which did him no harm, and then, what with
magic and fire, gave them a good dinner. But Master Rabbit was in sad
case, and it was many a day ere he got well.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_122"></span>[212:1](al44.htm#fr_122) Mr. Rand observes that
this is evidently an allusion to the bear's being supposed to live
during the winter by sucking his own paws.
