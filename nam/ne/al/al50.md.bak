### The Story of the Great Chenoo, as told by the Passamaquoddies.

(Passamaquoddy).

What the Micmacs call a Chenoo is known to the Passamaquoddies as a
*Kewahqu'* or *Kewoqu'*. And this is their origin. When the *k'tchi
m'téoulin*, or Great Big Witch, <span id="fr_143"></span>[1](#fn_143.md) is
conquered by the smaller witches, or *M'téoulinssisk*, they can kill him
or turn him into a *Kewahqu'*. He still fights, however, with the other
*Kewaquiyck*. When they get ready to fight, they suddenly become as tall
as the highest trees; their weapons are the trees themselves, which they
uproot with great strength. And this strength depends upon the quantity
or size of the piece of ice which makes the heart of the *Kewahqu'*.
This piece of ice is like

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

a little human figure, with hands, feet, head, and every member perfect.

The female Kewahqu' is more powerful than the male. They make a noise
like a roaring lion (*pee'htahlo*), but sharper (shriller) and more
frightful. Their abode is somewhere in *Kas mu das doosek*, in some cold
region in far Northern Canada.

In summer time they rub themselves all over with *poo-pooka-wigu*, or
fir balsam, and then roll themselves on the ground, so that everything
adheres to the body, moss, leaves, and even small sticks. This was often
seen of old by Indian hunters.

Once a newly married Indian couple had, according to Indian custom, gone
on the long fall and winter hunt. One day when the man was away an old
Kewahqu' came and looked into the wigwam. The wife was frightened, but
she made up her mind at once: she called him *Mittunksl*, or "my
father." The old Kewahqu' was very proud to be called father. When she
heard her husband returning she ran out and told him that a great
Kewahqu' was in the camp, and that he must call him *M'sil hose*, or
"father-in-law." So going in he did this, and the Kewahqu' was still
more pleased. So they lived with him, and hunted with him. He was very
skillful in the chase. When they came to broad and deep waters the
Kewahqu' would swim them with his son-in-law on his back. He could run
faster than any wild animal.

One day he told his children to go away to a great

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

distance. "There is a great female Kewahqu' coming to fight me. In the
struggle I may not know you, and may hurt you." So they went away as
fast and as far as they could, but they heard the fighting, the most
frightful noises, howls, yells, thundering and crashing of wood and
rocks. After a time the man determined to see the fight. When he got to
the place he saw a horrible sight: big trees uprooted, the giants in a
deadly struggle. Then the Indian, who was very brave, and who was afraid
that his father-in-law would be killed, came up and helped as much as he
could, and in fact so much that between them they killed the enemy. The
old Kewahqu' was badly but not fatally hurt, and the woman was very glad
her father came off victorious. She had always heard that a Kewahqu' had
a piece of ice for a heart. If this can be taken out, the Kewahqu' can
be tamed and cured. So she made a preparation or medicine, and offered
it to him. He did not know what it was, nor its strength, so he
swallowed it, and it gave him a vomit. She saw something drop, so
quietly picked it up: it was the figure of a man of ice; it was the
Kewahqu's heart. She, not being seen or noticed, put it in the fire,
when he cried, "Daughter, you are killing me now; you destroy my
strength." Yet she made him take more of the medicine, and a second
heart came out. This she also put on the fire. But when a third came he
grabbed it from her hand, and swallowed it. However, he was almost
entirely cured.

Another time an Indian village was visited by a

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

Kewahqu', but he was driven away by magic. The people marked *crosses*
on the trees where they expected the Kewahqu' to come. There was a great
excitement among the Indians, expecting to hear their strange visitor
with his frightful noises. It was the old people who gave the advice to
mark crosses on the trees.

Another time an Indian of either the Passamaquoddy or Mareschite tribe
was turned to a Kewahqu'. The last time he was seen was by a party of
Indian hunters, who recognized him. He had only small strips of
clothing. "This country," he said, "is too warm for me. I am going to a
colder one."

 

This story from the Passamaquoddy Anglo-Indian manuscript of Mitchell
supplies some very important deficiencies in the preceding Micmac
version. We are told that the *heart* of the Chenoo is of ice in human
figure. This human figure is that of the Kewahqu' himself, or rather his
very self, or microcosm. It is this, and not the liver, which is
swallowed by the victor, who thus adds another frozen "soul" to his own.
Of the three vomited by the Kewahqu', two were the hearts of enemies
whom he had conquered. He could not give up his own, however. It is much
more according to common sense that the woman should have given the
cannibal the magic medicine which made him yield his heart than that he
should voluntarily have purged himself. In the Micmac tale he merely
relieves his stomach; in the Passamaquoddy version he, by woman's
influence, loses his icy heart.

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

It is interesting to observe that the use of the Christian cross is in
the additional anecdote described as *magic*.

It is the main point in the Chenoo stories that this horrible being,
this most devilish of devils, is at first human; perhaps an unusually
good girl, or youth. From having the heart once chilled, she or he goes
on in cruelty, until at last the sufferer eats the heart of another
Chenoo, especially a female's. Then utter wickedness ensues. It is more
than probable that this leads us back to some dark and terrible Shaman
superstition, older than we can now fathom. There is a passage in the
Edda which its translator, Thorpe, thinks can never be explained. "I
believe," he writes, "the difficulty is beyond help." The lines are as
follows:—

"Loki scorched up <span id="fr_144"></span>[1](#fn_144.md)  
In his heart's affections,  
Had found a half-burnt  
Woman's heart.  
Loki became guileful  
from that wicked woman:  
thence in the world  
are all giantesses come."

Of which Thorpe writes, "The sense of this and the following line is not
apparent. They stand thus in the original: *Loki of hiarta lyrdi brendu,
fann hann hâlfsvidthin hugstein konu*, for which Grimm (Myth. Vorrede
37) would read *Loki ât hiarta lundi brenda, etc., Lokius comedit cor in
nemore assum, invenit* 

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

*semiustum mentis lapidem mulieris*." Whatever obscurity exists here, it
is evident that it means that Loki, having become bad, grew worse after
having got the half-burnt stone of a woman's soul. That is, his own
heart, half ruined, became utterly so after he had added to it the
demoralized *hugstein*, soul-stone, thought-stone, or *heart* of a
woman. If we assume that stone and heart are the same, the difficulty
vanishes. And they are one in the Chenoo, who, like Loki, illustrates or
symbolizes the passage from good to evil, which a German writer declares
is quicker than thought, or that very same *Hugi* which the Norse myth
puts forwards as swiftest of all runners. Loki, not as yet lost, gets
the stone heart of a giantess, and becomes an utter devil at once. The
Chenoo becomes an utter devil when he has swallowed the *thought-stone*
of a giantess, and so does Loki.
