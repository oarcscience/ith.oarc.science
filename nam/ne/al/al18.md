### How Glooskap had a great Frolic with Kitpooseagunow, a Mighty Giant who caught a Whale.

(Micmac.)

*N'kah-nee-oo*. In the old time (P.) Glooskap came to Pulewech Munegoo
(M., Partridge Island), and here he met with Kitpooseagunow, <span
id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52) whose mother had been slain by a fearful
cannibal giant. And it was against these that he made war all his life
long, as did Glooskap. Whence it came to pass that they loved one
another, which did not at all hinder them from having a hearty and merry
encounter, in which they missed but little of killing one or the other,
and all in the best natured way in the world.

Now, having come to Pulewech Munegoo, the lord

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

of men and beasts was entertained by Kitpooseagunow. And when the night
came, he who was born after his mother's death said to his guest, "Let
us go on the sea in a canoe and catch whales by torchlight;" to which
Glooskap, nothing loath, consented, for he was a mighty fisherman, as
are all the Wabanaki of the seacoast. <span
id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53)

Now when they came to the beach there were only great rocks, lying here
and there; but Kitpooseagunow, lifting the largest of these, put it on
his head, and it became a canoe. And picking up another, it turned to a
paddle, while a long splinter which he split from a ledge seemed to be a
spear. Then Glooskap asked, "Who shall sit in the stern and paddle, and
who will take the spear?" Kitpooseagunow said, "That will I." So
Glooskap paddled, and soon the canoe passed over a mighty whale; in all
the great sea there was not his like; but he who held the spear sent it
like a thunderbolt down into the waters, and as the handle rose again to
sight he snatched it up, and the great fish was caught. And as
Kitpooseagunow whirled it on high, the whale, roaring, touched the
clouds. Then taking him from the point, the fisher

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

tossed him into the bark as if he had been a trout. And the giants
laughed; the sound of their laughter was heard all over the land of the
Wabanaki. And being at home, the host took a stone knife and split the
whale, and threw one half to the guest Glooskap, and they roasted each
his piece over the fire and ate it.

Now the Master, having marked the light, which was long in the heaven
after the sun went clown, said, "The sky is red; we shall have a cold
night." And his host understood him well, and saw that he would make it
cold by magic. So he bade Marten bring in all the fuel he could find,
and all there was of the oil of a porpoise; and this oil he so
multiplied by magic that there was ten times more of it. And they sat
them down and smoked, and told tales of old times; but it grew ever
colder and colder. And at midnight, when all was burnt out, Marten froze
to death, and then the grandmother, but the two giants smoked on, and
laughed and talked. Then the rocks out-of-doors split with the cold, the
great trees in the forest split; the sound thereof was as thunder, but
the Master and he who was born after his mother's death laughed even
louder. And so they sat until the sun rose. Then Glooskap said to the
dead woman, "*Noogume, numchahse*!" (M.) Grandmother, arise!" and to his
boy, "*Abistanooch numchahse*!" "Marten, arise!" and they arose, and
went about their work.

And the morning being bright, they went forth far into the forest to
find game. But they got very little, for they caught only one small
beaver, and Glooskap

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

gave up his share of this to Kitpooseagunow. And he, taking the skin,
fastened it to his garter, whence it dangled like the skin of a mouse at
the knee of a tall man. But as he went on through the woods the skin
grew larger and larger and larger, till it broke away by its own weight.
Then the giant twisted a mighty sapling into a withe, and fastened it
around his waist. But it still grew apace as he went on, till, trailing
after, it tore down all the forest, pulling away the trees, so that
Kitpooseagunow left a clean, fair road behind him. <span
id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54)

And when the night came on they fished again, as they had done before;
and again it was said, but this time by the host, "The sky is red; we
shall have a cold night." So they heaped up wood more than the first
time, but now it was far colder. And soon the boy was dead, and the
grandmother also lay frozen. But when the sun rose the Master brought
them back to life, and, bidding good-by to Kitpooseagunow, went his
way. <span id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_55)

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

The most striking feature, however, of this legend is its Norse-like
breadth or grandeur and its genial humor, which are very remarkable
characteristics for the fictions of savages. Its resemblance to the
Scandinavian tales is, if accidental, very remarkable. The two heroes
are, like Thor and Odin, giant heroes who make war on Jötuns and Trolls;
that is, giant-like sorcerers. It is their profession; they live in it.
No one can read Beowulf without being struck by the great resemblance
between Grendel, the hideous, semi-human night prowler, and the
Kewahqu', a precisely similar monster, who rises from the depths of
waters to wantonly murder man. I do not recall any two beings in any
other two disconnected mythologies so strangely similar. The fishing for
the whale re-calls that which is told in the Older Edda (Hymiskvida,
21), where Hymir succeeds in hooking two of these fish:—

"Then he and Hymir rowed out to sea. Thor rowed oft with two oars, and
so powerfully that the giant was obliged to acknowledge they were
speeding very fast. *He himself rowed at the prow*."

If the reader will compare this account of the Edda with the Micmac
story, he cannot fail to be struck with the great resemblance between
them. It

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

is even specified in both that the hero, though a guest, paddles. And in
both instances the host catches a whale. Now compare with this the
legend of Manobozho-Hiawatha, who merely catches the great sunfish, and
is swallowed by it. Does it not seem as if the Western Indians had here
borrowed from the Micmacs, and the Micmacs from the Norse? Whether this
was done directly or through the Eskimo is as yet a problem. It may also
be noted that both in the Edda and in the Micmac story, it is declared
that one of the giants picked up the boat and carried it.

It may be observed that most of these Indian traditions were originally
poems. It is probable that all were sung, while they still retained the
character of serious mythical or sacred narrative. Now they are in the
transition state of heroic tales. But they unquestionably still retain
many passages of very great antiquity, and it is not impossible that
Eskimo and even Norse songs are still preserved in them. In this tale
the following coincidences with passages in the Elder Edda (Hymiskvida)
are remarkable. In both the host asks his guest to go with him to catch
whales, to which the latter assents.

"We three to-morrow night  
Shall be compelled  
On what we catch to live.'  
Thor said he would  
On the sea row."

Kitpooseagunow picks up the heavy canoe, with its oars and a spear, and
carries them.

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

"Thor went,  
grasped the prow  
quickly with its hold-water,  
lifted the boat  
together with its oars  
and scoop ;  
bore to the dwelling  
the curved vessel."

Glooskap, asks which of the two shall take the paddle, and which sit in
the stern. Hymir inquires,--

"Wilt thou do  
half the work with me?  
either the whales  
home to the dwelling bear,  
Or the boat  
fast bind?"

Kitpooseagunow drew up a whale.

"The mighty Hymir,  
He alone  
two whales drew  
up with his hook."

After this whale-fishing, the Scandinavian giants at home have a trial
of strength and endurance. Thor throws a cup at Hymir. This cup can only
be broken on Hymir's head, which is of ice, and intensely hard.

"That is harder  
than any cup."

This is therefore an effort on the part of Thor to overcome Cold. Hymir
is the incarnation of Cold itself.

"The icebergs resounded  
as the churl approached; <span id="page_81">p. 81</span>  
the thicket on his cheeks  
was frozen.  
In shivers flew the pillars  
At the Jotun's glance."

That is, the frost cracks the stones and rocks. In the Indian tale the
two giants try to see which can freeze the other. In both there is
distinctly a contest, In the Norse tale Strength or Heat fights Frost;
in the American, Frost is battled with by Frost as a rival.

It may be observed that the Indian tale is far from being perfect, and
that in all probability the whole of it includes a fishing for the
sea-serpent.

It is plainly set forth in the Edda that Cold may be overcome by a magic
spell. Thus Groa (Grougaldr, 12) promises her son a rune to effect
this:—

"A seventh (charm) I will sing thee  
If on a mountain high  
frost should assail thee,  
deadly cold shall not  
thy body injure,  
nor draw it to thy limbs."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_52"></span>[74:1](al18.htm#fr_52) *Kitpooseagunow*, "one
born after his mother's death," is a magician-giant, who plays in the
Algonquin mythology a part only inferior to that of Glooskap, whom he in
every way resembles. Both are benevolent, both make war on wicked
sorcerers and evil wild beasts, and both, finally, are much like
Gargantua and Pantagruel in their sense of humor. They are sometimes
made the heroes of the same adventure in different stories. The true
origin of the name, according to Mr. Rand, is as follows: "After a cow
moose or caribou has been killed, her calf is sometimes taken out alive,
and reared by hand. As may be supposed, the calf is very easily tamed.
The animal thus born is called *Kitpooseagunow*, and from this a verb is
formed which denotes the act."--*Legends of the Mic Macs, Old Dominion
Monthly*, 1871.

This giant was also called the Protector of the Oppressed. He probably
represents the Glooskap myth in another form.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[75:1](al18.htm#fr_53) Glooskap would seem to
have been the prototype of the giant fisher so well known in song:—

"His rod was made of a sturdy oak,  
His line, a cable, in storms ne'er broke  
He baited his hook with a dragon's tail,  
And sat on a rock and bobbed for whale.'

A fabulous monster, apparently identical with the dragon, is common in
Micmac stories.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[77:1](al18.htm#fr_54) Many of these stories
have received later additions, which can be detected by their occurring
only in single versions of them. In the story of Kitpooseagunow (Rand's
manuscript) the giants arrive at a "large town," and go to a "store,"
where they sell the skin for all the motley, goods, houses, and lands
which the merchant possesses. "And the skin was so heavy that it took
the greater part of the day to weigh it."

<span id="fn_55"></span>[77:2](al18.htm#fr_55) It is possible that there
is a version of this story in which Glooskap kills his friend with
frost, and then revives him. In one story it is a *frozen stream*,
incarnate as a man, which attempts in vain to freeze Glooskap.

The extraordinary manner in which host and guest, or even <span
id="page_78">p. 78</span> intimate friends, endeavor to *kill* one
another in the most good-natured rivalry, is of constant occurrence in
the Eskimo legends. It is not infrequent among our own backwoods or
frontier-men.

The stone-canoe occurs in Eskimo legends (*vide* Rink), as it does in
those of all American Indians.
