# THE INVISIBLE ONE.

(Micmac.)

There was once a large Indian village situated on the border of a
lake,--*Nameskeek' oodun Kuspemku* (M.). At the end of the place was a
lodge, in which dwelt a being who was always invisible. <span
id="fr_178"></span>[1](#fn_178) He had a sister who attended to his
wants, and it was known that any girl who could see him might marry him.
Therefore there were indeed few who did not make the trial, but it was
long ere one succeeded.

And it passed in this wise. Towards evening, when the Invisible One was
supposed to be returning home, his sister would walk with any girls who
came down to the shore of the lake. She indeed could see her brother,
since to her he was always visible, and beholding him she would say to
her companions, "Do you see my brother?" And then they would mostly
answer, "Yes," though some said, "Nay,"--*alt telovejich, aa
alttelooejik*. And then the sister would say, "*Cogoowa'
wiskobooksich*?" "Of what is his shoulder-strap made?" But as some tell
the tale, she would

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

inquire other things, such as, "What is his moose-runner's haul?" or,
"With what does he draw his sled?" And they would reply, "A strip of
rawhide," or "A green withe," or something of the kind. And then she,
knowing they had not told the truth, would reply quietly, "Very well,
let us return to the wigwam!"

And when they entered the place she would bid them not to take a certain
seat, for it was his. And after they had helped to cook the supper they
would wait with great curiosity to see him eat. Truly he gave proof that
he was a real person, for as he took off his moccasins they became
visible, and his sister hung them up; but beyond this they beheld
nothing not even when they remained all night, as many did.

There dwelt in the village an old man, a widower, with three daughters.
The youngest of these was very small, weak, and often ill, which did not
prevent her sisters, especially the eldest, treating her with great
cruelty. The second daughter was kinder, and sometimes took the part of
the poor abused little girl, but the other would burn her hands and face
with hot coals; yes, her whole body was scarred with the marks made by
torture, so that people called her *Oochigeaskw* (the rough-faced girl).
And when her father, coming home, asked what it meant that the child was
so disfigured, her sister would promptly say that it was the fault of
the girl herself, for that, having been forbidden to go near the fire,
she had disobeyed and fallen in.

Now it came to pass that it entered the heads of

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

the two elder sisters of this poor girl that they would go and try their
fortune at seeing the Invisible One. So they clad themselves in their
finest and strove to look their fairest; and finding his sister at home
went with her to take the wonted walk down to the water. Then when He
came, being, asked if they saw him, they said, "Certainly," and also
replied to the question of the shoulder-strap or sled cord, "A piece of
rawhide." In saying which, they lied, like the rest, for they had seen
nothing and got nothing for their pains.

When their father returned home the next evening he brought with him
many of the pretty little shells from which *weiopeskool* (M.), or
wampum, was made, <span id="fr_179"></span>[1](#fn_179) and they were
soon engaged *napawejik* (in stringing them).

That day poor little Oochigeaskw', the burnt-faced girl, who had always
run barefoot, got a pair of her father's old moccasins, and put them
into water that they might become flexible to wear. And begging her
sisters for a few wampum shells, the eldest did but call her "a lying
little pest," but the other gave her a few. And having no clothes beyond
a few paltry rags, the poor creature went forth and got herself from the
woods a few sheets of birch bark, of which she made a dress, putting
some figures on the bark. <span id="fr_180"></span>[2](#fn_180)

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And this dress she
shaped like those worn of old. <span id="fr_181"></span>[1](#fn_181) So
she made a petticoat and a loose gown, a cap, leggins, and handkerchief,
and, having put on her father's great old moccasins,--which came nearly
up to her knees,--she went forth to try her luck. For even this little
thing would see the Invisible One in the great wigwam at the end of the
village.

Truly her luck had a most inauspicious beginning, for there was one long
storm of ridicule and hisses, yells and hoots, from her own door to that
which she went to seek. Her sisters tried to shame her, and bade her
stay at home, but she would not obey; and all the idlers, seeing this
strange little creature in her odd array, cried, "Shame!" But she went
on, for she was greatly resolved; it may be that some spirit had
inspired her.

Now this poor small wretch in her mad attire, with her hair singed off
and her little face as full of burns and sears as there are holes in a
sieve, was, for all this, most kindly received by the sister of the
Invisible One; for this noble girl knew more than the mere outside of
things as the world knows them. And as the brown of the evening sky
became black, she took her down to the lake. And erelong the girls knew
that He had come. Then the sister said, "Do you

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

him?" And the other replied with awe, "Truly I do,--and He is
wonderful." "And what is his sled-string?" "It is," she replied, "the
Rainbow." And great fear was on her. "But, my sister," said the other,
"what is his bow-string?" "His bowstring is *Ketaksoowowcht*" (the
Spirits' Road, the Milky Way). <span id="fr_182"></span>[1](#fn_182)

"Thou hast seen him," said the sister. And, taking the girl home, she
bathed her, and as she washed all the scars disappeared from face and
body. Her hair grew again; it was very long, and like a blackbird's
wing. Her eyes were like stars. In all the world was no such beauty.
Then from her treasures she gave her a wedding garment, and adorned her.
Under the comb, as she combed her, her hair grew. It was a great marvel
to behold.

Then, having done this, she bade her take the *wife's seat* in the
wigwam,--that by which her brother sat, the seat next the door. And when
He entered, terrible and beautiful, he smiled and said, "*Wajoolkoos*!"
"So we are found out!" "*Alajulaa*." "Yes," was her reply. So she became
his wife. <span id="fr_183"></span>[2](#fn_183)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_178"></span>[303:1](al66.htm#fr_178) In this Micmac tale,
which is manifestly corrupted in many ways, the hero is said to be "a
youth whose *teeomul* (or tutelary animal) was the moose," whence he
took his name. In the Passamaquoddy version nothing is said about a
moose. A detailed account of the difficulty attending the proper
analysis of this tradition will be found at the end of this chapter.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[305:1](al66.htm#fr_179) In Passamaquoddy
wampum is called *waw-bap*. It is said that a single bead required a
full day's work to make and finish it. It is not many years since it was
made much more expeditiously in certain New York villages.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[305:2](al66.htm#fr_180) Probably by scraping.
Birch bark (*moskwe*) peeled in winter <span id="page_306">p. 306</span>
can have the thin dark brown coat scraped away, leaving a very light
yellowish-brown ground. Tomah Josephs and his niece Susan, of Princeton,
Maine, are experts at this work.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[306:1](al66.htm#fr_181) This remark indicates
the lateness of the Micmac version of this very old myth.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[307:1](al66.htm#fr_182) The Spirits' or
Ghosts' Road, so called because it is believed to be the highway by
which spirits pass to and from the earth. The Micmac version, belittled
and reduced in every way, limits this reply to "a *piece* of a rainbow."
There is a graudeur of conception in the Passamaquoddy myth which
recalls the most stupendous similes in Scripture.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[307:2](al66.htm#fr_183) This is the true end
of this Indian Cupid and Psyche legend. But the Micmacs having, for no
apparent reason, made the Stupendous Deity of the Heavens a moose
(Teäm), have added to it <span id="page_308">p. 308</span> another for
the sake of the name, and which I give in due succession simply as an
illustration of the manner in which tales are tacked together. I have
very little doubt that the story as here given is an old solar myth,
worked up, perhaps, with the story of Cinderella, derived from a,
Canadian-French source. There are enough of these French-Indian stories
in my possession alone to form what would make one of the most
interesting volumes of the series of the *Contes Populaires*. The
Passamaquoddy version is to this effect: "There was a great being, a
mighty hunter, who had a wife, of wonderful magic gifts, and a boy; and
the child became blind. After a long time his sight returned, and he
said so; but his mother was suspicious, and did not believe him." It is
evident that she suspected that he saw by clairvoyance, not by literal
vision. "So one day she bade her husband put on certain things which no
one could behold who did not see them in truth. Then she asked the boy,
'What has your father for a sled-string?' (literally for a moose-runner
haul). And he replied, 'The rainbow to haul by.' Then she asked him yet
again, 'What has he for a bow-string?' And he answered, '*Ke'taksoo
wowcht*;' 'The Spirits' or Ghosts' Road.' And once more she inquired,
'What has he off his sled?' To which he said, 'A beaver.' Then she knew
that he could indeed see." (T. Josephs.)

We can perceive by shreds and patches such as these the all but loss of
an early and grand mythology which has undergone the usual transmutation
into romantic and nursery legends. By great exertion we might recover
it, but the old Indians who retain its fragments are passing away
rapidly, and no subject attracts so little interest among our literati.
A few hundred dollars expended annually in each State would result in
the collection of all that is extant of this folk-lore; and it hundred
years hence some few will, perhaps, regret that it wits not done.

It may be observed that in the Edda the rainbow is the heavenly road
over which the gods pass. The rainbow is not the Milky Way, but it may
be observed that in this tale the two are <span id="page_309">p.
309</span> curiously compared, or almost identified. But according to
Charles Francis Keary (*Mythology of the Eddas*, London, 1882), "there
is small hint in the Edda of the use of the rainbow as a path for souls,
save where Helgi says to his wife,--

"'\`T is time for me to ride the ruddy road,  
And on my horse to tread the path of flight,'"

which is more applicable to the Milky Way than the rainbow. "We owe," he
says, "to the learned Adalbert Kuhn some researches which have traced
the path of the Milky Way as a bridge of souls from its first appearance
in Eastern creeds to its later appearance in mediæval German tradition."
(*Zeitschrift f. v. Sp. l. c.*) In the Vedas the Milky Way is called the
Gods' Path. The American Indians firmly believe that the Spirits' Road
is one of their very earliest traditions, and I believe with them that
they had it long before Columbus discovered this country.

Since the foregoing remarks were written, Mrs. W. Wallace Brown has
obtained the following fragment, which was given as a song, and declared
to be very ancient:—

"There was a woman, long, long ago:  
She came out of a hole.  
In it dead people were buried.  
She made her house in a tree;  
She was dressed in leaves,  
All long ago.  
When she walked among the dry leaves  
Her feet were so covered  
The feet were invisible.  
She walked through the woods,  
Singing all the time,  
'I want company; I'm lonesome!'  
A wild man heard her:  
From afar over the lakes and mountains  
He came to her.  
She saw him; she was afraid;  
She tried to flee away,  
For he was covered with the rainbow;  
Color and light were his garments.  
She ran, and lie pursued rapidly;  
He chased her to the foot of a mountain. <span id="page_310">p.
310</span>  
He spoke in a strange language;  
She could not understand him at first.  
He would make her tell where she dwelt.  
They married; they had two children.  
One of them was a boy;  
He was blind from his birth,  
But he frightened his mother by his sight.  
He could tell her what was coming,  
What was coming from afar.  
What was near he could not see.  
He could see the bear and the moose  
Far away beyond the mountains;  
He could see through everything."

'The old Indian woman ended this story by saying abruptly "Don't know
any more. Guess they all eat up by *mooin*" (the bear). She said that it
was only a fragment. "If you could have heard her repeat this," adds
Mrs. Brown, "in pieces, stopping to explain what the characters said,
and describing how they looked, and anon singing it again, you would
have got the *inner sense* of a wonderfully weird tale. The woman's feet
covering and the man's dress *like* a rainbow, yet not one, which made
their bodies invisible, seemed to exercise her imagination strangely;
and these were to her the most important part of the story." The
fragment is part of a very old myth; I regret to say a very obscure one.
