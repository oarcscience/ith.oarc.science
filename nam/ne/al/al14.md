### How Glooskap sailed through the great Cavern of Darkness.

(Micmac.)

Now it is told in another tradition--and men tell even this
differently--that *pitché*, in these old times (P.) Glooskap's seven
neighbors, who were all so many different animals, took away his family,
and that he followed them, even as it has been written, unto
Newfoundland. And when he came there it was night, and, finding Marten
alone, he took him forth into the forest to seek food, putting his belt
on the boy, which gave him such power that he hunted well and got much
meat.

So it came to pass that the next morning Dame Kah-kah-gooch, the
Crow, <span id="fr_41"></span>[2](#fn_41) observed that Marten was

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

drying meat on his wigwam. And this she spread abroad. But when the
people learned that the child had done this, a great fear came upon them
all, and they sat every man in his lodge and awaited death, for they
knew that the Master had come.

And he indeed came; but when he saw them all as frightened as rabbits
before the wild-cat, he laughed aloud and forgave them, for he was noble
and generous. And as they were hungry--for he had come in hard times--he
gave them much venison, and sorrow departed from their wigwams. But as
they had left him of old, he now left them. When they knew him not they
left him to die; now that they know him they feared lest they should
perish without him. But he turned his steps towards other paths.

Now having made a canoe, the Master, with Marten and Dame Bear, went
upon a mighty river. As the story says, it was broad and beautiful at
first, and so they sailed away down towards its mouth. Then they came to
great cliffs, which gathered round and closed over them. But the river
ran on beneath these, and ever on far underground, deeper and deeper in
the earth, till it dashed headlong into rapids, among rocks and ravines,
and under cataracts which were so horrible that death seemed to come and
go with every plunge of the canoe. And the water grew narrower and the
current more dreadful, and fear came upon

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Marten and the
woman, so that they died. But the Master sat with silent soul, though he
sang the songs of magic, and so passed into the night, but came forth
again into sunlight. And there was a lonely wigwam on the bank, into
which he bore Marten and the grandmother, and saying, "*Numchahse*!
arise!" lo, they arose, and deemed they had only slept. And now Glooskap
had gained the greatest power. <span id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42)

This incident of passing through darkness, on a roaring stream in a
frail bark, before emerging to sunlight or illumination, was not only in
the ancient heathen myths. We are reminded of it by the storm through
which Jesus passed with the disciples. That it made a great impression
upon the Indians is shown by its being told of Pulewech, the Partridge,
who is a type of Glooskap, and who, like him, makes war on the powers of
evil, set forth in the Porcupines. The Indians, who imagined and
selected so many wild and terrible tests to form the Shaman, or
sorcerer, as well as the warrior, would hardly neglect that of *de
profundis clamavi*, the storm, the waves, darkness, and the roaring
flood.

If there is really any Norse influence in this tale, this river must be
the one mentioned in the Vafthrudnismal,--

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

"Ifing the stream is called  
which earth divides between  
the Jötuns and the gods.  
Open it shall run  
throughout all time.  
On that stream no ice shall be."

It will be observed that, having gone down or across this, stream,
Pulewech finds himself in the country of the Evil sorcerers; that is,
Jötunheim. To conquer a river among the Norse, in a dream, was a sign of
victory; to be carried away by one was a terrible omen.

"Methought a river ran  
Through the whole house,  
that it roared violently,  
rushed over the benches,  
brake the feet of you  
brothers twain;  
Nothing the water spared;  
Something that will portend."  
(Atlamâl, in Grœnlenzku, 25.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_41"></span>[59:2](al14.htm#fr_41) *Kah-kah-gooch*, Micmac,
*Kah-kah-goos*, Passamaquoddy. The Crow is represented in several
stories as always peeping, spying, <span id="page_60">p. 60</span>
begging, pilfering, and tale-bearing about a town. The Passamaquoddy
Indians have peculiar superstitions as regards killing the crow.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[61:1](al14.htm#fr_42) This incident of the
passage underground is deeply suggestive of Wabeno mystery and
initiation. It will strike every student of classic lore as almost
identical with much that he has read. If it has not the same symbolical
meaning here, it has apparently none whatever.
