### Of the Great Deeds which Glooskap did for Men; how he named the Animals, and who they were that formed his Family.

(Passamaquoddy.)

*Woodénit atók-hagen Gloosekap*: <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md)
this is a story of Glooskap. It is told in traditions of the old time
that Glooskap was born in the land of the Wabanaki, which is nearest to
the sunrise; but another story says that he came over the sea in a great
stone canoe, and that this canoe was an island of granite covered with

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

trees. When the great man, of all men and beasts chief ruler, had come
down from this ark, he went among the Wabanaki. <span
id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md) And calling all the animals he gave them
each a name: unto the Bear, *mooin*; and asked him what he would do if
he should meet with a man. The Bear said, "I fear him, and I should
run." Now in those days the Squirrel (*mi-ko*) was greater than the
Bear. Then Glooskap took him in his hands, and smoothing him down he
grew smaller and smaller, till he became as we see him now. In
after-days the Squirrel was Glooskap's dog, and when he so willed, grew
large again and slew his enemies, however fierce they might be. But this
time, when asked what he would do should he meet with a man, Mi-ko
replied, "I should run up a tree."

Then the Moose, being questioned, answered, standing still and looking
down, "I should run through the woods." And so it was with Kwah-beet the
Beaver, <span id="fr_12"></span>[2](#fn_12.md) and Glooskap saw that of all
created beings the first and greatest was Man.

Before men were instructed by him, they lived in

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

darkness; it was so dark that they could not even see to slay their
enemies. <span id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md) Glooskap taught them how to
hunt, and to build huts and canoes and weirs for fish. Before he came
they knew not how to make weapons or nets. He the Great Master showed
them the hidden virtues of plants, roots, and barks, and pointed out to
them such vegetables as might be used for food, as well as what kinds of
animals, birds, and fish were to be eaten. And when this was done he
taught them the names of all the stars. He loved mankind, and wherever
he might be in the wilderness he was never very far from any of the
Indians. He dwelt in a lonely land, but whenever they sought him they
found him. <span id="fr_14"></span>[2](#fn_14.md) He traveled far and wide:
there is no place in all the land of the Wabanaki where he left not his
name; hills, rocks and rivers, lakes and islands, bear witness to him.

Glooskap was never married, yet as he lived like other men he lived not
alone. There dwelt with him an old woman, who kept his lodge; he called
her Noogumee, "my grandmother." (Micmac.) With her was a youth named
Abistanaooch, or the Martin. (M.) And Martin could change himself to a
baby or a little

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

boy, a youth or a young man, as befitted the time in which he was to
act; for all things about Glooskap were very wonderful. This Martin ate
always from a small birch-bark dish, called *witch-kwed-lakun-cheech*
(M.), and when he left this anywhere Glooskap was sure to find it, and
could tell from its appearance all that had befallen his family. And
Martin was called by Glooskap Uch-keen (M.) "my younger brother." The
Lord of men and beasts had a belt which gave him magical power and
endless strength. And when he lent this to Martin, the younger brother
could also do great deeds, such as were only done in old times.

Martin lived much with the Mikumwess or Elves, or Fairies, and is said
to have been one of them.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_10"></span>[28:1](al08.htm#fr_10.md) Passamaquoddy.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[29:1](al08.htm#fr_11.md) This part of the legend
is from a very singular and I may add almost unintelligible manuscript,
*Storey about Glooscap*, written in English by a Passamaquoddy Indian.
The word *ark* which occurs in it reminds me that the Indian from whom I
obtained it once asked me if I did not think that Glooskap was the same
as Noah. This sentence is as follows in the Indian-English of the
original: "Gloosecap hat left from ark come crosse even wiht
wabnocelel."

<span id="fn_12"></span>[29:2](al08.htm#fr_12.md) This is very obscure in
the original manuscript. It reads "Herask beaber did do anything just
look behager."

<span id="fn_13"></span>[30:1](al08.htm#fr_13.md) This was read to me by an
Indian from a wampum record, now kept at Sebayk. I do not think I am
mistaken in the phrase. It probably refers to ignorance of warlike
weapons.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[30:2](al08.htm#fr_14.md) This is from the Rand
manuscript. The writer remarks that these expressions were the very
words of a Micmac Indian named Stephen Flood, "who had no idea that he
was using almost the identical expressions of Holy Writ with reference
to God."
