The following poem on Glooskap may be appropriately placed in this work.
The allusion to the agates of Cape Blomidon refers to a tradition given
by S. T. Rand, which states that when Glooskap would make his adopted
grandmother young again he created the brilliant stones, which are still
found at that place, to adorn her. <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90)

### THE LEGEND OF GLOOSKAP.

Bathed in the sunshine still as of yore  
Stretches the peaceful Acadian shore;  
Fertile meadows and fields of grain  
Smile as they drink the summer rain.

There like a sentinel, grim and gray,  
Blomidon stands at the head of the bay,  
And the famous Fundy tides, at will,  
Sweep into Minas Basin still.

With wondrous beauty the Gaspereaux  
Winds its way to the sea below,  
And the old Acadian Grand Pré  
Is the home of prosperous men to-day.

The place where Basil the blacksmith wrought,  
In the glow of his forge, is a classic spot,  
And every summer tourists are seen  
In the fairy haunts of Evangeline.

But the old Acadian woods and shores,  
Rich in beautiful legend stores,  
Were once the home of an older race,  
Who wove their epics with untaught grace.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

Long ere the dikes that guard for aye  
From the merciless tides the old Grand Pré,  
Built by the Frenchman's tireless hands,  
Grew round the rich Acadian lands,

The Micmac sailed in his birch canoe  
Over the Basin, calm and blue;  
Speared the salmon, his heart's desire,  
Danced and slept by his wigwam fire;

Far in the depth of the forest gray  
Hunted the moose the livelong day,  
While the mother sang to her Micmac child  
Songs of the forest, weird and wild.

Over the tribe, with jealous eye,  
Watched the Great Spirit from on high,  
While on the crest of Blomidon  
Glooskap, the God-man, dwelt alone.

No matter how far his feet might stray  
From the favorite haunts of his tribe away,  
Glooskap could hear the Indian's prayer,  
And send some message of comfort there.

Glooskap it was who taught the use  
Of the bow and the spear, and sent the moose  
Into the Indian hunter's hands;  
Glooskap who strewed the shining sands

Of the tide-swept beach of the stormy bay  
With amethysts purple and agates gray,  
And brought to each newly wedded pair  
The Great Spirit's benediction fair.

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

But the white man came, and with ruthless hand  
Cleared the forests and sowed the land,  
And drove from their haunts by the sunny shore  
Micmac and moose, forevermore.

And Glooskap, saddened and sore distressed,  
Took his way to the unknown West,  
And the Micmac kindled his wigwam fire  
Far from the grave of his child and his sire;

Where now, as he weaves his basket gay,  
And paddles his birch canoe away,  
He dreams of the happy time for men  
When Glooskap shall come to his tribe again.
