### II. How Mahtigwess, the Rabbit dined with the Woodpecker Girls, and was again humbled by trying to rival them.

Now Master Rabbit, though disappointed, was not discouraged, for this
one virtue he had, that he never gave up. <span
id="fr_121"></span>[1](#fn_121.md) And wandering one day in the wilderness,
he found a wigwam well filled with young women, all wearing red
head-dresses; and no wonder, for they were Woodpeckers. Now, Master
Rabbit was a well-bred Indian, who made himself as a melody to all
voices, and so he was cheerfully bidden to bide to dinner, which he did.
Then one of the red-polled pretty

girls, taking a *woltes*, or wooden dish, lightly climbed a tree, so
that she seemed to run; and while ascending, stopping here and there and
tapping now and then, took from this place and that many of those
insects called by the Indians *apchel-moal-timpkawal*, or rice, because
they so much resemble it. And note that this rice is a dainty dish for
those who like it. And when it was boiled, and they had dined, Master
Rabbit again reflected, "La! how easily some folks live! What is to
hinder me from doing the same? Ho, you girls! come over and dine with me
the day after to-morrow!"

And having accepted this invitation, all the guests came on the day set,
when Master Rabbit undertook to play woodpecker. So having taken the
head of an eel-spear and fastened it to his nose to make a bill, he
climbed as well as he could--and bad was the best--up a tree, and tried
to get his harvest of rice. Truly he got none; only in this did he
succeed in resembling a Woodpecker, that he had a red poll; for his pate
was all torn and bleeding, bruised by the fishing-point. And the pretty
birds all looked and laughed, and wondered what the Rabbit was about.

"Ah!" said his grandmother, "I suppose he is trying again to do
something which he has seen some one do. 'T is just like him."

"Oh, come down there!" cried Miss Woodpecker, as well as she could for
laughing. "Give me your dish!" And having got it she scampered up the
trunk, and soon brought down a dinner. But it was

long ere Master Rabbit heard the last of it from these gay tree-tappers.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_121"></span>[210:1](al43.htm#fr_121.md) It will be seen in the
end that this great Indian virtue of never giving in eventually raised
Rabbit to power and prosperity. *Il y a de morale ici*.
