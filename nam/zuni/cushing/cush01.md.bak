# Zuñi Fetiches

From "Zuñi Fetiches," *Second Annual Report of the Bureau of American
Ethnology*, 1880-1881 (Washington, D.C., 1883), pp. 9-15, 30-31.

THE Á-shi-wi, or Zuñis, suppose the sun, moor., and stars, the sky,
earth, and sea, in all their phenomena and elements; and all inanimate
objects, as well as plants, animals, and men, to belong to one great
system of all-conscious and interrelated life, in which the degrees of
relationship seem to be determined largely, if not wholly, by the
degrees of resemblance. In this system of life the starting point is
man, the most finished, yet the lowest organism; at least, the lowest
because most dependent and least mysterious. In just so far as an
organism, actual or imaginary, resembles his, is it believed to be
related to him and correspondingly mortal; in just so far as it is
mysterious, is it considered removed from him, further advanced,
powerful, and immortal. It thus happens that the animals, because alike
mortal and endowed with similar physical functions and organs, are
considered more nearly related to man than are the gods; more nearly
related to the gods than is man, because more mysterious, and
characterized by specific instincts and powers which man does -not of
himself possess. Again, the elements and phenomena of nature, because
more mysterious, powerful and immortal, seem more closely related to the
higher gods than are the animals; more closely related to the animals
than are the higher gods, because their manifestations often resemble
the operations of the former.

In consequence of this, and through the confusion of the subjective with
the objective, any element or phenomenon in nature which is believed to
possess a personal existence, is endowed with a personality analogous to
that of the animal whose operations most resemble its manifestation. For
instance, lightning is often given the form of a serpent, with or
without an arrow-pointed tongue, because its course through the sky is
serpentine, its stroke instantaneous and destructive; yet it is named
*Wí-lo-lo-a-ne*, a word derived not from the name of the serpent itself,
but from that of its most obvious trait, its gliding, zigzag motion. For
this reason, the serpent is supposed to be more nearly related to
lightning than to man; more nearly related to man than is lightning,
because mortal and less mysterious. As further illustrative of the
interminable relationships which are established on resemblances fancied
or actual, the flint arrowpoint may be cited. Although fashioned by man,
it is regarded as originally the gift or "flesh" of lightning, as made
by the power of lightning, and rendered more effective by these
connections with the dread element; pursuant of which idea, the zigzag
or lightning marks are added to the shafts of arrows. A chapter might be
written concerning this idea, which may possibly help to explain the
Celtic, Scandinavian, and Japanese beliefs concerning "elf-shafts," and
"thunder-stones," and "bolts."

In like manner, the supernatural beings of man's fancy--the "master
existences"--are supposed to be more nearly related to the personalities
with which the elements and phenomena of nature are endowed than to
either animals or men; because, like those elements and phenomena, and
unlike men and animals, they are connected with remote tradition in a
manner identical with their supposed existence to-day, and therefore are
considered immortal.

To the above descriptions of the supernatural beings of Zuñi Theology
should be added the statement that all of these beings are given the
forms either of animals, of monsters compounded of man and beast, or of
man. The animal gods comprise by far the largest class.

In the Zuñi, no general name is equivalent to "the gods," unless it be
the two expressions which relate only to the higher or creating and
controlling beings-the "causes," Creators and Masters,
"*Pí-kwain-á-hâ-i*" (Surpassing Beings), and "*Á-tä-tchu*"
(All-fathers), the beings superior to all others in wonder and power,
and the "Makers" as well as the "Finishers" of existence. These last are
classed with the supernatural beings, personalities of nature, object
beings, etc., under one term-

a\. *Í-shothl-ti-mon-á-hâ-i*, from *í-shothl-ti-mo-na* = ever recurring,
immortal, and *â-hâ-i* = beings.

Likewise, the animals and animal gods, and sometimes even the
supernatural beings, having animal or combined animal and human
personalities, are designated by one term only--

b\. *K?ia-pin-á-hâ-i*, from *k?ia-pin-na* = raw, and *á-hâ-i* beings. Of
these, however, three divisions are made:

(1.) *K?ia-pin-á-hâ-i* = game animals, specifically applied to those
animals furnishing flesh to man.

(2.) *K?iä-shem-á-hâ-i*, from *k?iä-we* = water, *she-man* = wanting,
and *á-hâ-i* = beings, the water animals, specially applied not only to
them, but also to all animals and animal gods supposed to be associated
sacredly with water, and through which water is supplicated.

(3.) *Wê-ma-á-hâi*, from *we-ma* = prey, and *á-hâ-i* = beings, "Prey
Beings," applied alike to the prey animals and their representatives
among the gods. Finally we have the terms--

c\. *Ak-na-á-hâ-i*, from *ák-na* = done, cooked, or baked, ripe, and
*á-hâ-i* = beings, the "Done Beings," referring to mankind; and

d\. *Ash-i-k?ia-á-hâ-i*, from *ä'-sh-k?ia* = made, finished, and
*á-hâ-i* = beings, "Finished Beings," including the dead of mankind.

That very little distinction is made between these orders of life, or
that they are at least closely related, seems to be indicated by the
absence from the entire language of any general term for God. True,
there are many beings in Zuñi Mythology godlike in attributes,
anthropomorphic, monstrous, and elemental, which are known as the
"Finishers or makers of the paths of life," while the most superior of
all is called the "Holder of the paths (of our lives);' *Hâ'-no-o-na
wí-la-po-na*. Not only these gods, but all supernatural beings, men,
animals, plants, and many objects in nature, are regarded as personal
existences, and are included in the one term *á-hâ-i*, from *á*, the
plural particle signifying "all," and *hâ-i*, being or life, ="Life,"
"the Beings." This again leads us to the important and interesting
conclusion that all beings, whether deistic and supernatural, or
animistic and mortal, are regarded as belonging to one system; and that
they are likewise believed to be related by blood seems to be indicated
by the fact that human beings are spoken of as the "children of men,"
while all other beings are referred to as "the Fathers," the
"All-fathers," and "Our Fathers."

It naturally follows from the Zuñi's philosophy of life, that his
worship, while directed to the more mysterious and remote powers of
nature, or, as he regards them, existences, should relate more
especially to the animals; that, in fact, the animals, as more nearly
related to himself than are these existences, more nearly related to
these existences than to himself, should be frequently made to serve as
mediators between them and him. We find this to be the case. It follows
likewise that in his inability to differentiate the objective from the
subjective he should establish relationships between natural objects
which resemble animals and the animals themselves; that he should even
ultimately imitate these animals for the sake of establishing such
relationships, using such accidental resemblances as his motives, and
thus developing a conventionality in all art connected with his worship.
It follows that the special requirements of his life or of the life of
his ancestors should influence him to select as his favored mediators or
aids those animals which seemed best fitted, through peculiar
characteristics and powers, to meet these requirements. This, too, we
find to be the case, for, preeminently a man of war and the chase, like
all savages, the Zuñi has chosen above all other animals those which
supply him with food and useful material, together with the animals
which prey on them, giving preference to the latter. Hence, while the
name of the former class is applied preferably as a general term to all
animals and animal gods, as previously explained, the name of the latter
is used with equal preference as a term for all fetiches (*Wé-ma-we*),
whether of the prey animals themselves or of other animals and beings.
Of course it is equally natural, since they are connected with man both
in the scale of being and in the power to supply his physical wants more
nearly than are the higher gods, that the animals or animal gods should
greatly outnumber and even give character to all others. We find that
the Fetiches of the Zuñis relate mostly to the animal gods, and
principally to the prey gods.

This fetichism seems to have arisen from the relationships heretofore
alluded to, and to be founded on the myths which have been invented to
account for those relationships. It is therefore not surprising that
those fetiches most valued by the Zuñis should be either natural
concretions, or objects in which the evident original resemblance to
animals has been only heightened by artificial means.

Another highly prized class of fetiches are, on the contrary, those
which are elaborately carved, but show evidence, in their polish and
dark patina, of great antiquity. They are either such as have been found
by the Zuñis about pueblos formerly inhabited by their ancestors or are
tribal possessions which have been handed down from generation to
generation, until their makers, and even the fact that they were made by
any member of the tribe, have been forgotten. It is supposed by the
priests (*Á-shi-wa-ni*) of Zuñi that not only these, but all true
fetiches, are either actual petrifactions of the animals they represent,
or were such originally. Upon this supposition is founded the following
tradition, \[regarding the "drying of the world" by the Twin Gods in the
"days of the new"\].

Now that the surface of the earth was hardened, even the animals of
prey, powerful and like the fathers (gods) themselves, would have
devoured the children of men; and the Two thought it was not well that
they should all be permitted to live, "for," said they, "alike will the
children of men and the children of the animals of prey multiply
themselves. The animals of prey are provided with talons and teeth; men
are but poor, the finished beings of earth, therefore the weaker."

Whenever they came across the pathway of one of these animals, were he
great mountain lion or but a mere mole, they struck him with the fire of
lightning which they carried in their magic shield. *Thlu!* and
instantly he was shriveled and burnt into stone.

Then said they to the animals that they had thus changed to stone, "That
ye may not be evil unto men, but that ye may be a great good unto them,
have we changed you into rock everlasting. By the magic breath of prey,
by the heart that shall endure forever within you, shall ye be made to
serve instead of to devour mankind."

Thus was the surface of the earth hardened and scorched and many of all
kinds of beings changed to stone. Thus, too, it happens that we find,
here and there throughout the world, their forms, sometimes large like
the beings themselves, sometimes shriveled and distorted. And we often
see among the rocks the forms of many beings that live no longer, which
shows us that all was different in the "days of the new."

Of these petrifactions, which are of course mere concretions or
strangely eroded rock-forms, the Zuñis say, "Whomsoever of us may be met
with the light of such great good fortune may see (discover, find) them
and should treasure them for the sake of the sacred (magic) power which
was given them in the days of the new. For the spirits of the
*We-ma-á-hâ-i* still live, and are pleased to receive from us the Sacred
Plume (of the heart--*Lä-sho-a-ni*), and sacred necklace of treasure
(*Thlâ-thle-a*); hence they turn their ears and the ears of their
brothers in our direction that they may hearken to our prayers (sacred
talks) and know our wants."

This tradition not only furnishes additional evidence relative to the
preceding statements, but also, taken in connection with the following
belief, shows quite clearly to the native wherein lies the power of his
fetiches. It is supposed that the hearts of the great animals of prey
are infused with a spirit or medicine of magic influence over the hearts
of the animals they prey upon, or the game animals (*K?ia-pin-á-hâ-i*);
that their breaths (the "Breath of Life"--*Hâ-i-an-pi-nan-ne*--and soul
are synonymous in Zuñi Mythology), derived from their hearts, and
breathed upon their prey, whether near or far, never fail to overcome
them, piercing their hearts and causing their limbs to stiffen, and the
animals themselves to lose their strength. Moreover, the roar or cry of
a beast of prey is accounted its *Sá-wa-ni-k?ia*, or magic medicine of
destruction, which, heard by the game animals, is fatal to them, because
it charms their senses, as does the breath their hearts. Since the
mountain lion, for example, lives by the blood ("life fluid") and flesh
of the game animals, and by these alone, he is endowed not only with the
above powers, but with peculiar powers in the senses of sight and smell.
Moreover, these powers, as derived from his heart, are preserved in his
fetich, since his heart still lives, even though his person be changed
to stone. . . .

Fetiches")\[2\]

The relative value of these varieties of fetiches depends largely upon
the rank of the Animal god they represent. For instance, the Mountain
Lion is not only master of the North, which takes precedence over all
the other "ancient sacred spaces" (*Té-thlä-shi-na-we*), or regions, but
is also the master of all the other Prey gods, if not of all other
terrestrial animals. Notwithstanding the fact that the Coyote, in the
Order of the Hunt (the Coyote society or the *Sá-ni-a-k?ia-kwe*), is
given for traditional reasons higher sacred rank than the Mountain Lion,
he is, as a Prey Being, one degree lower, being god of the West, which
follows the North in order of importance. Hence we find the Mountain
Lion and Coyote fetiches far more prized than any of the others, and
correspondingly more numerous. The Coyote in rank is younger brother of
the Mountain Lion, just as the Wild Cat is younger brother of the
Coyote, the Wolf of the Wild Cat, and so on to the Mole, and less
important Ground Owl. In relationship by blood, however, the yellow
Mountain Lion is accounted older brother of the blue, red, white,
spotted, and black Mountain Lions; the blue Coyote, older brother of the
red, white, yellow, mottled or spotted, and black Coyotes.\[1\] So the
Wild Cat of the South is regarded as the older brother of the Wild Cats
of all the other five regions. And thus it is respectively with the
Wolf, the Eagle, and the Mole. We find, therefore, that in the North all
the gods of Prey are represented, as well as the Mountain Lion, only
they are yellow. In the West all are represented, as well as the Coyote,
only they are blue; and thus throughout the remaining four regions.

The Mountain Lion is further believed to be the special hunter of the
Elk, Deer, and Bison (no longer an inhabitant of New Mexico). His fetich
is, therefore, preferred by the hunter of these animals. So, also, is
the fetich of the Coyote preferred by the hunter of the Mountain Sheep;
that of the Wild Cat, by the hunter of the Antelope; that of the Wolf,
by the hunter of the rare and highly-valued *Ó-ho-li*; those of the
Eagle and Falcon, by the hunter of Rabbits; and that of the Mole, by the
hunter of other small game.

The exception to this rule is individual, and founded upon the belief
that any one of the gods of Prey hunts to some extent the special game
of all the other gods of Prey. Hence, any person who may discover either
a concretion or natural object or an ancient fetich calling to mind or
representing any one of the Prey gods will regard it as his special
fetich, and almost invariably prefer it, since he believes it to have
been "meted to" him (*an'-ik-tchi-a-k?ia*) by the gods.

Notes

1\. Each of the six species of prey animals--Mountain Lion (North), Bear
(West), Badger (South), White Wolf (East), Eagle (Upper), and Prey Mole
(Lower)--"is again divided into six varieties, according to color. . .
.For instance, the Mountain Lion (Yellow) is primarily god of the North,
but he is supposed to have a representative (younger brother) in the
West (the Blue Mountain Lion), another in the South (the Red), in the
East (the White), in the Upper regions (the Spotted), and in the lower
regions (the Black). Hence, also, there are six varieties of the fetich
representing any one of these divisions . . . "("Zuñi Fetiches," pp.
24-25). See figure 1 for fetich representations of these six species of
prey animals.

2\. "The Priesthood of the Bow possesses three fetiches. These three
beings are the Mountain Lion (fig. 2.2); the great White Bear *Ain-shi
k'ó-ha-na*, god of the scalp-taking ceremonials (Fig. 3.2), and the
Knife-feathered Monster, *Á-tchi-a lä-to-pa* (Fig. 2.1).

"This \[latter\] curious god, \[who is\] sometimes classed with \[the
prey animals\], sometimes with the higher beings, \[and who\] may safely
be said to form a connecting link between the idolatry proper of the
Zuñis and their fetichism, . . . is the hero of hundreds of folklore
tales, and the tutelar deity of several of the societies of Zuñi. He is
represented as possessing a human form, furnished with
flint-knife-feathered pinions, and tail. His dress consists of the
conventional terraced cap (representative of his dwelling-place among
the clouds), and ornaments, badge, and garments of the Kâ'-kâ. His
weapons are the Great Flint-Knife of War, the Bow of the Skies (the
Rain-bow), and the Arrow of Lightning, and his guardians or warriors are
the Great Mountain Lion of the North and that of the Upper regions. He
was doubtless the original War God of the Zuñis, although now secondary,
in the order of war, to the two children of the Sun. Anciently he was
inimical to man, stealing and carrying away to his city in the skies the
women of all nations, until subdued by other gods and men of magic
powers. At present he is friendly to them, rather in the sense of an
animal whose food temporarily satisfies him than in the beneficent
character of most of the gods of Zuñi.

"Both the Great White Bear and the Mountain Lion of the War Priesthood
are, as well as the Knife-feathered Demon, beings of the skies. For this
reason the fetich of the Mountain Lion of the skies (of aragonite) is
preferred by a Priest of the Bow above all other kinds of colors."
