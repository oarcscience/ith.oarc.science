# Clowns, Priests, and Festivals of the Kâ'-kâ

From "Zuñi Breadstuff", *Millstone* 10, no. 8 (1885): 141-44.

PERHAPS the most sacred, though least secret of \[Zuñi\] esoteric
societies, is the *Kâ'-kâ*, or great dance organization-truly the church
of these pagan worshipers, if church they may be said to possess, for in
it are included priests, laymen and song-leaders. The public
celebrations of this *Kâ'-kâ* consist of wonderfully fantastic dances,
in which gods, demons and the men of ancient times are dramatically
represented by costumed actors. Inside one of the estufas, or
subterranean council chambers, which, on occasions of great moment are
embellished with fringed and plumed bows strung across their
entrance-ladders, rituals are repeated, prayers and sacrifices offered
during a whole night preceding the public appearance of the actors. But
during the day the worship consists almost wholly of dances to the time
of loud invocation chants and wild metric music. To describe the various
features of this worship would be to give a history of the whole Zuñi
mythology and delineate a hundred diverse and striking costumes and
maskings. In each celebration, however, certain elements are constant.
Such are the clowns--priests annually elected from the membership of the
*Kâ'-kâ*, and disguised as monsters, with warty, wen-eyed,
pucker-mouthed pink masks \[see fig. 7\] and mud-bedaubed equally pink
bodies.

First appear the dancers, some fifty of them, costumed and masked with
such similarity that individuals are as indistinguishable as the birds
or the animals they conventionally represent are from each other.
Large-jawed and staring-eyed demons of one kind or another marshal them
into the open plaza of the village under the guidance of a sedate
unmasked priest bearing sacred relies and prayer-meal. One of the demons
sounds a rattle and howls the first clause in the song stanza; then all
fall into line, all in equal time sing the weird song, and go through
the pantomime and dance which invariably illustrate its theme. When four
verses have been completed, the actors, bathed in perspiration, retire
to their estufa to rest and pray, while the priest-clowns appear with
drum, cabalistic prayer-plumes and the paraphernalia of guess-games.
They begin the absurdest, most ingenious and witty of buffoonery and
raillery, generally managing, nevertheless, to explain during their
apparently nonsensical dialogues, the full meanings of the dance and
song-the latter being often couched in archaic or jargonistic terms
utterly incomprehensible to others than the initiated among the audience
which throngs the terrace-tops. To merely see these clowns, without
understanding a word of their incessant and really most humorous jabber,
is to laugh immoderately. To understand everything, withal, is to
sometimes wish from sheer excess of laughing, that the dancers would
file in and thus put an end to their jibes and antics.

Figure 7. Clown's Heads

If these clowns accompany certain most beautiful corn-dances of late
autumn, then each bears a bundle of beautifully painted and feathered
toy bows and arrows, or hideous dolls, with all sorts of bread-loaves
and cakes depending from them. The bread tied to the bows has usually
the forms of deer, antelope, rabbits, turkeys or other game animals,
while that attached to the dolls-unless these be of a certain kind-has
the shape of delicately-made cakes of all forms other than such as above
described, with sometimes the effigies of infants or men and women
interspersed. Toward evening when all the spectators are gathered in
full force, the clowns take up their burdens of toys, and go searching
cautiously and grotesquely amid the children as though afraid of the
person they sought. When one of them finds the object of his search, he
stares, wiggles, cuts capers and dodges about, approaching nearer and
nearer the wondering child and extending the toy he has selected.
Finally the half-frightened little one is induced by its mother to reach
for the treasure; as it clutches the proffered gift the clown suddenly
straightens up and becomes grave, and delivers a long loud-toned
harangue. If the toy he has just handed be a bow and arrows, it is given
to a boy; if a doll, to either a very *little* boy, or a girl. The bow
and arrows symbolize the hunt whereby the little man shall in later life
provide the food rudely represented by the eatable effigies tied to it.
The doll with its fanciful loaves is emblematic of housewifely dexterity
and, with the addition of the little human effigies, of the duties and
cares of maternity. So, too, the lectures delivered with the presents
correspond to the functional character of the toys represented.

It is with these dolls, carved in imitation of the personae of the
sacred dance, that the Zuñi child is first taught the simpler of the
myriad weary prayer formulae which, as a member of the *Kâ'-kâ* he will
have to become familiar with by and by. With them, also, the little
maiden is first initiated into the mysteries of the matron-life she will
some day presumably lead, as well as into the less profound rites of
food consecration and hospitality.

As the Zuñi New Year approaches, the dances increase in number and
variety. The ten clowns appear at night eight days before the grand
festival, for the last time in their yearly service. They tell the
people who assemble by torchlight to listen to their final
ludicrosities, that the great feast day is at hand; that the men must
make new garments for the women, and the women renew their houses with
whitewash and cleaning for the men; their larders with fresh he'-we,
he'-pa-lo-k?ia and other breadstuffs, for the strangers who are sure to
flock in from the neighboring tribes to participate in the lavish
festivities, witness the elaborate ceremonials and barter for the
products of the Zuñi looms and kitchens.

With a few not very delicate jokes (for the New Year is of all others
the marrying time in Zuñi) the clowns retire to their secret lodgings,
there to remain until sun-rise eight days later, initiating the ten
newly-chosen priests into the mysteries of their humor-laden vocation
and severe ritualistic duties.

Thousands of sheep are driven in during the ensuing days, hundreds of
them and dozens of cattle slaughtered, dissected and piled up in the
corner of the newly plastered rooms. Hunters come in from the southern
wilds bringing game, messengers speed away to surrounding tribes,
bearing invitations to all who may wish to feast from Zuñi plenty or
witness Zuñi dancing and beauty. Fires bum all over the house-tops each
night cooking *he'-pa-lo-k?ia*, and all day in the little cooking rooms
the *he'-we* stones are kept hot for the busy bakings. I have seen in
one house at such times, twenty sheep carcasses, two quartered cattle,
enough *he'-we* to fill a wagon box, and numerous other dishes of the
kinds already so specifically described.

On the seventh evening the cry of the Sun-Priest is heard announcing the
approach of "The Gods and the Ancients." At midnight, south of the town
near the foot-hills, watch-fires are built to guide these coming
personations--the chiefs and priests of the *Kâ'-kâ*, whose shrill
flutes pipe dolefully in the night wind, and the rattles of whose masked
attendants sound sharply on the frosty air. All night long, Navajos,
Moquis, Pueblos and not a few Apaches, decked out in their finest
costumes, and painted with ochre, vermillion, blue powder and marrow
until their faces shine like those of Mediaeval Madonnas, ride in from
the surrounding country and take up their quarters with welcoming hosts
on every hand.

But in the midst of all these busy preparations, the "Meal with the
Fathers" is not forgotten. I have said before that husbands abandon
their own homes when they marry, to dwell in the houses of their wives.
Early on the morning of New Year, however, old men may be seen tottering
from place to place, gathering up their married sons and conducting them
to homes of their nativity. Arrived there, the mother welcomes them as
though returned from a long journey, and the first bread broken on that
day of all days in the Zuñi year, is sacrificed in their honor on the
hearth around which she has seen these sons, mostly grown middle-aged,
frolic or play at the games they now scarce remember.

As the day wears away the Sun-Priest of the *Kâ'-kâ*--a god *pro tem*
and treated as such--\[and\] the priests of a lesser degree, bird-like,
beast-like, monster-like in apparel and disguise, come from where the
fires burned last night, in solemn procession. Amid the showers of
prayer meal with which they are reverently received, they consecrate the
pueblo, the ladders of new houses and the plazas of the dances they are
the leaders of. Later on they are followed by the *Sha'-la-k?o*, or
giant war-priests of the *Kâ'-kâ*. These demoniac monsters tower far
above the new clowns, flute players, and armed Priests of the Bow who
herald and conduct their approach. They are ingeniously made effigies,
long-haired, bearded, great-eyed, and long-snouted, so managed by means
of strings and sticks by a person concealed under their ample,
embroidered skirts that they seem alive, and strike terror to the
uninitiated.

On entering the new houses they come to consecrate, they crouch low
beside the sun-altar and glare out with gaping, clapping beaks and
rolling eyes from the dark corner they are ensconced in, or fitfully
start up at certain signals from the singer and drummers, like gigantic
"Jacks" till their head-plumes fairly brush the rafters and their
resounding clappers wake every sleepy child in the assemblage with
nightmares of Zuñi devils and perdition. . . .

At about midnight, when fires glare fiercest and brightest in every
sacred house in Zuñi, in each of them are stretched out like huge
strings of beads across the immaculate floors, the rows and rows of
round bowls, baskets and little black cooking-pots which make up the
service of a great Zuñi feast.

Yet for long stand these many vessels of tempting viands untouched; for
the Sun-Priest, the hereditary Priest of the House, the chief Priest of
the Bow, all in turn have to pronounce long-winded rituals over them.
Then the black-masked youth personating the god of fire, sweeps in
bearing his burning brand of cedar bark, and gracefully swinging it over
each kind of food, brushes away, as it were, the impure influences. The
Priest of the Bow once more pronounces an invocation, takes a few bits
of food from each dish, hands it to attendant juniors, who disappear to
sacrifice it, then turns with a smile to the great crowd and calls out:

"Thus many have the days been numbered,  
"The days of our anxious awaiting,  
"That we might EAT WITH THE BELOVED!"

Whereupon the women echo his last clause and the hungry crowd gathers
about the bowls and baskets. Eating is then the main business. Except
for the shouts--"Approach with salt!"--"The favor of more meat this
way."--"The he'-we is wasted down here"--"I am satisfied, thanks."--and
the various appropriate responses, nothing is heard but the clatter of
bones on the floor and the subdued smacking of lips; for the feasts of
ceremonials are most decorous, and few of the rules for showing one's
approbation at ordinary dinners are deemed in place at these, where the
gods themselves are supposed to be the hosts and hostesses.

There is one other great festival, greater even than this. It is the
"Initiation of Children" into the *Kâ'-kâ*. Occurring only once in four
years, it is prepared for months beforehand, follows a fast of eight
days, and lasts two days and two nights. The supply for it is provided
with liberal hand by the parents of the little ones for whom it is
instituted. Indeed, prodigality in everything seems to be the order of
the day.

I cannot pause to describe separately the many fanciful personages which
take part in this observance. There are the six-colored
*Sa-la-mo-pi-as*, the Gods of the Dance, the Ancient "Long-homed-Demons"
of war, the light-footed Tablet-dancers, and the Bird-beasts of the
Mountains and Oceans, represented. The novitiates having been duly
dieted almost to starvation, are ranged in a circular row about the main
plaza, their backs covered with robes and blankets. To prepare them for
the passage under the fringed bow of \[the\] mystic estufa, they are
soundly drubbed with long wands by each one of the forty-eight dancers,
four times, four blows each time. Although the paddings on their backs
be thick, they howl piteously before the several hundred blows they have
to crouch under be meted out to them; and the more they howl the harder
descend the blows. When this flagellation is completed, they are led
into the estufa, there to be divested of most of their coverings, and
again most soundly flogged, though this time a less number of times.
Then, indeed, their cries resound and they wriggle to free themselves
from the firm hands of their weird captors. After this comes a grand
baptism, and a breathing into the nostrils of the still whimpering
urchins, of the sacred breath of the *Kâ'-kâ*. No sooner is this done
then the great effigy of the sea serpent, managed by means of invisible
cords, wriggles into their midst through a curtained port-hole, and
vomits with unearthly groanings a quantity of green medicine-water, with
the drinking of which the poor frightened little wretches are freed from
the probation of the estufa.

Meanwhile, outside, the two white-bodied, gray-headed tribute-bearers of
the gods--whose faces are grim and ghastly with their great deep eyes
and black hand-marks over the mask-mouths--appear on the scene. They are
followed by the *Sa-la-mo-pi-a* crew and the little god of fire. From
house-top to house-top they go, throughout the pueblo, casting down the
rarest vessels--set out to await them--and breaking up baskets and all
other food vessels not hidden before their approach. As each vessel
strikes the ground the *Sa-la-mo-pi-as* rush upon it and dance it into
the ground--while the baskets as they fall are lighted by the torch of
the fire god, and soon nothing but cinders remain of their bright colors
and involved pattern-work. When it is considered that over each bowl,
basket and water-jar or cooking pot a series of passes have to be made
by the tribute collectors with their plumed wands, a prayer said, and a
low, long dirge moan uttered, it may be conceived that, naked as they
are in the cold winter afternoon, theirs is no enviable task; but the
end of it signalizes the cessation of ceremonials, and the beginning of
the joyous feasting. In the abandoned estufa, however, all through that
boisterous night, a strange crowd of priests is gathered. The leaders of
the *Kâ'-kâ* are assembled to listen to the great epic of creation,
delivered by a masked and beautifully appareled priest. This epic, or
ritual, is the Iliad of Zuñi. It is kept and handed down word for word
by four priests, one of whom no sooner dies than another member of the
*Kâ'-kâ* is installed in his place. One of these priests repeats every
word of the ritual once in each of the six estufas, every fourth year.
Each repetition requires six hours for its delivery--thirty-six hours in
all-during which time the solemn-toned, rapid-speeched priest is not
allowed to taste food other than O'ki'dis-lu water. Not once is his mask
raised. None save those of the innermost circle of the *Kâ'-kâ* are
supposed to know whom they are listening to, and the people at large so
reverence the office, that to touch this priest's garments with the
finger-tips as he is borne along from estufa to estufa by the ten
clowns, is deemed a sacred, favor-laden grace.

Opposed to these, and the many other festivals I might tell of, are the
Fasts, not less abundant in Zuñi. The most important of these, because
almost universally observed, is the fast following the New Year
festival. When the war-gods have been set up in their shrines on Thunder
Mountain and the Mount of the Beloved, and the great "Last Fire" has
been kindled as a signal by the Priests of the Bow, then only certain
kinds of vegetable food are eaten by man, woman or child in Zuñi. All
meat, all fatty matter, even vessels which have been contaminated by the
touch of flesh, are abstained from. No fire is built out of doors during
ten days, nor are many other things, allowable at other times, indulged
in. The last night of the ten, however, is again full of ceremonial.
Again the cooking-fires are busy. At daylight, however, they are all put
out, and the cinders and ashes thrown to the winds of the open valley.
Two nearly nude maskers of the dance may be seen in the twilight swiftly
wending their way to a distant, lonely cañon, where the God of Fire is
supposed to have once dwelt. There, with an ancient stick and shaft,
they kindle tinder by drilling the two sticks together, and lighting a
torch hurry it back to the great central estufa, where matrons, maidens
and young men anxiously await the gift of New Fire. No sooner are the
new flames kindled from this on the hearths of the households, than
great baskets of food are cast into them, that the imperishable
substance of life may be wafted upward into the outer world as food for
the spirits of the ancestry and those who have died during the year just
past. By no means unbeautiful is the sight of a gentle matron standing
in prayer before the fireplace, dressed as if to meet beloved friends,
and weeping softly to herself as she casts loaf after loaf unsparingly
into the flames. Then, by all save the hereditary priests, who must
continue their mortification of appetite six days longer, the great fast
is broken.

Whenever a man is initiated into the Priesthood or one of the sacred
Medicine Societies of the tribe, severe fastings are required. Never
shall I forget the wretched existence I led during the four days of my
probation when it had been decided I should become a "Priest of the
Bow." In the council chamber of that priesthood I was confined. All
meat, cooked food, salt, warmth and other comforts, including the
cigarette, were denied me. Every morning, at the rising of the sun, I
was conducted to an enormous bowl of dark, greenish-yellow
medicine-water. By the side of this bowl stood another equally ample,
but empty, and laid conveniently near, a *turkey-quill*. The offices of
the extra bowl and the turkey-quill may be better implied than described
when I say that I had to drink every drop--four gallons in all--of the
tepid, nauseating draught before me. It left me weak and very empty each
of those painful mornings, and after a pilgrimage to a distant shrine
under the guardianship of a matron of my clan and two stalwart warriors,
my breakfast, what though raw and stale, seemed most tempting--until I
essayed to become satisfied of it! By the third day the habit of
indigestion--artificially induced as has been described--became quite
easy and natural; and although the "rising-water," turkey-quill and
extra bowl were just as vigorously forced on my notice by my guardians,
there really was no other than a purely chimerical reason for their use.

There is one secret order of the tribe wherein initiatory rules, though
severe, are of quite an opposite nature. It is an esoteric society, of
which I spoke in a foot-note of the first chapter of this series--the
*Ne'-we-kwe*, or "Gluttons."\[1\] Like the ten mud-priests, they are the
most ridiculous of clowns when they appear in public, the most serious
of sacred personages when gathered into the secret councils. They are
the medicine-men *par excellence* of the tribe, whose special province
is the cure of all diseases of the stomach--the elimination of poisons
from the systems of the victims of sorcery or imprudence. They are
exempt from all fasts, though denied for life the use of two or three
kinds of delicacies, such as water-cress, and the flesh of the birds
sacred to their order. But the penalty they have to pay is a dear one.
No foods aside from the latter taboos are unwholesome or, whatever their
conditions, are considered harmful to them. Nude to the waist,
grotesquely painted about the eyes and mouth, there is no chance for
deception when, in broad daylight, they sit down to a "demonstration" in
the middle of the dance plaza. I have seen one of them gather about him
his melons, green and ripe, raw peppers, bits of stick and refuse,
unmentionable water, live puppies--or dead, no matter--peaches, stones
and all, in fact everything soft enough or small enough to be forced
down his gullet, including wood-ashes and pebbles, and, with the
greatest apparent gusto, consume them all at a single sitting. Once
after such a repast, two of these *Ne'-wes* pretended, though their
stomachs were bloated to distortion, to still be hungry. They fixed
their staring eyes on me, and motioned me to give them something else to
eat! I pitied them profoundly, but as it is considered the height of
indecency to refuse a *Ne'-we* anything, I ran home, caught up some
crackers, threw them into a paper, and in order to make them relish the
better, poured a pint or two of molasses over them. I wrapped an old
woolen army jacket around this as a present to the enterprising clowns,
and hurried back. There they were anxiously waiting--the people watching
them to see how much more they could get away with. I cast the bundle
into the plaza. The pair immediately fell to fighting for its
possession, consequently broke the paper, scattered some of the crackers
about the ground and daubed the back of the coat thoroughly with the
molasses. They gathered up the fragments of crackers and ate them--with
their whole burden of adhesions, then fought over the paper and ate
that, finally tore pieces out of the back of the coat with their teeth
and ate them (though it nearly choked them to do so), after which the
victor put the coat on and triumphantly wore it, his painted skin
showing like white patches through the holes he had bitten in the back
of the coat. I observed that ere long--one at a time--they disappeared.
When either returned he was fairly *lank* and pretended to be woefully
hungry--and manifested, moreover, quite as much readiness to devour
everything as before.

Whatever the "medicine" is that these *Ne'-wes* possess, it must be
superlatively good; for I have never yet known one to die from the
effect of his extraordinary gourmandizing, and but one to grow sick
during my long stay in the Pueblo--*he* only for a little while.

I hesitate to record in this, my last article on Breadstuff, the many
other seemingly super-gastral exploits of these inimitably funny
doctor-clowns. The most amusing chapter within the scope of my pen would
be such a record; but not only would it be too often disgusting to one
unaware of its almost heroic motive, it would be wholly disbelieved by
such of my readers as never chanced to visit me in Zuñi and personally
witness the performances of these *Ne'-wes*. When it is considered,
however, that the *Ne'-we* never appears in public as a demonstrator of
the power of his medicine until after years of arduous training, even
then only after elaborate preparation, it will be conceded that the
above narration transcends in no wise mere sober truth.

Figure 8. Zuñi Mendicants

The *Ne'-wes* may frequently be seen in seasons of scarcity, going from
house to house in company with the *Keo'-yi-mo-shi*, or Priest-clowns,
and in the service of certain strange mendicants. These mendicants
usually travel in pairs. They are powerful men disguised as saurian
monsters. Their heads are entirely encased in enormous long-jawed masks
precisely resembling--what with their teeth of plaited corn-husk or
shining squash-seeds--the heads of crocodiles. Out of the foreheads of
these masks, stare eyes composed of balls of buckskin painted white and
dotted with black, so adjusted that like the eyes of wax dolls they roll
about or seem to wink with the upward, downward or side-wise motion of
the man they disguise. The masks, cloths fastened to them to conceal the
neck and bodies of the performers, are painted black, and a streamer of
dark colored cloth hangs down the back and trails behind, covered with a
row of eagle plumes which stand erect like the spines in a sea-monster's
dorsal fin. All over the head and body of these figures are little
patches of snowy eagle down--stuck on with wild honey--to represent
scales. The mendicants are dressed in the armlets, wristlets, sashes and
badges of war to proclaim their bloodthirsty proclivities. They are
armed with bows and long arrows tipped with corn-cobs. This latter
circumstance is fortunate for the *Ne'-wes* and *Keo'-yi-mo-shi*; for no
sooner does one of the latter succeed in gathering up a blanket-load of
*he'-we*, corn or other provender, than he is unmercifully plugged by
the howling monsters \[see illustration\] and compelled to make a
deposit of his precious cargo, or else goaded on to beg for more. If any
woman to whom application is made by a *Keo'-yi-mo-shi*, be hardy enough
to refuse him alms, the clown rushes bawling and whimpering back to his
monster-master who, uttering low, hoarse gutteral bellows, very becoming
to his appearance, proceeds to shoot out a few window-lights in her
house, or sends--not very gently, either--two or three arrows at the
woman herself, or her children, until she is fain to hand over any kind
of breadstuff she may have at hand.

Figure 9. Demon Inspector of Oven

But ere we complete this series on ZUÑI BREADSTUFF, let us see how, once
in four years or eight, the ovens whence it issues in such abundant
variety are cleaned (ceremonially speaking) of the last vestiges of old
bakings and the "bad influences" which are accounted as having
accumulated in them.

On a certain summer evening of the fourth or, as the case may be, eighth
year, a curious figure--a veritable ideal chimney-sweep appears. Black
as the soot with which he is painted can make him, is he; bristling at
many points with tufts of hair and cedar brushes, His head is round like
an oven; round too his eyes, like flue-holes, with yellow ladders
painted over them for brows. A bunch of stiff hair surmounts his crown,
out of which issues like a flame a red eagle plume to symbolize fire.
His mouth is almost square like an oven-door, but with red lips--the
light gleaming out when the stone door is closed--with a stiff thin
beard shooting forth from its under side which makes it look, despite
its parallelogramic proportions, like a cyclopean eye with heavy
winkers--placed too low down. On either cheek is painted in glaring
yellow the paw of a badger or some other famous burrower--also symbolic
of function. The creature carries in one hand a wand of yucca leaves
with which to scourge away dogs; and in the other a little broom of
hemlock. To his rump is fastened a long cord of fiber like the tail of a
kite. As he travels along he staggers, crooks his thighs, crawls
eccentrically from side to side and plunges this way and that as though
seeking for or trying to enter ovens; for in everything he sees nothing
but ovens--sometimes mistakes ladders or even burros for such and
strives to get into them. When at last he espies a veritable oven, he
leaps wildly toward it with a low growl of satisfaction, and eagerly
disappears through its dark doorway. Presently out come crumbs and
fragments of bread or bits of *he'-we* (left there, of course, in
anticipation of his visit) which scarcely strike the ground before they
are grabbed up by the ever attendant *Keo'-yi-mo-shi*, or *Ne'-wes*.
Dust and cinders follow--as though the oven had never been cleaned!--nor
do the exertions of the Oven-demons cease short of mischief to the
masonry of the structure, unless; one of his companions, with great
to-do, snakes him forth by means of the long rope of fiber. No sooner is
he out than he turns on his captor with his yucca weapon, and breaks
away and goes plunging along to another oven, and so on until every
dome-shaped bread receptacle in the village has been duly visited and
purified.

Thus, O, patient reader, with thanks indeed for your longsuffering
kindness in the reading of these hasty sketches, let us leave these
ovens, nor pollute them again with fresh bakings, or the mention of
them!
