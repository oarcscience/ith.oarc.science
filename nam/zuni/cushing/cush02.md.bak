# Remarks on Shamanism

From "Discussion of J. Cheston Morris' Address \['The Relation of the
Pentagonal Do-decahedron Found near Marietta, Ohio, to Shamanism'\] and
"Remarks on Shamanism," *Proceedings of the American Philosophical
Society* 36 (1897): 184-92.

THE account Dr. Morris has given us as to what Mr. Williams related to
him concerning the life of an Indian youth of the Nez Percé tribe has
interested me exceedingly by reason of its striking similarity to what I
have myself heard, seen, and experienced among the Zuñi Pueblo Indians
of New Mexico.

With these people, a child is not thought of, when first born, as quite
yet a living mortal being. It is referred to as "it" or the "new being,"
nor is any name given to it until after the lapse of nine days. It is
supposed to be *kái'-yu-na* and *ai'-ya-vwi*--unripe and tender, or soft
and susceptible as are germinating seeds or unfinished clay vessels,
until after one full day for each of the lunar months of its
inter-uterine gestation has passed. During this period of nine days it
is usually kept with its mother, secluded from the outer world and from
sunlight, in order that it may gradually become hardened to, and so,
safe in the "world of daylight"--as these people term the scene and
condition of mortal life-that is, condensed to "middle being"--as they
further term men's particular mortal existence.

At the close of this ceremonial period the umbilical cord, which has
meanwhile sloughed off or has been removed and zealously cared for, is
ceremoniously buried in the soil at some particular place, in order that
thereat may be formed the "midmost shrine" of the child, and therein its
connection with the earth mother-as formerly with its mortal mother-may
be established, and that its vitality apart from her thenceforward, be
maintained--by thus placing within the fertile bosom of the Universal
Mother, that through which erstwhile the child received separately, or
secondarily, its being, nourishment and growth, from its human mother.

Passing over many other ceremonials which attend the first naming of the
child and its introduction to the Sun and to the tribe of its descent on
the early morning of the tenth day (that is, at the end of these nine
natal days), a few words relative to the meaning of the "midmost shrine"
will serve to indicate what would likely be the symbolic significance to
a people like the Nez Percé and the Zuñi Indians, of such an object
(whether natural or artificial) as the one to which Dr. Morris has
called our attention.

He has quite accurately stated, in the theory he has advanced regarding
this object, the view one of these Indians would hold, as to the meaning
of the *number* of its sides or faces and itself. To one of them, a cube
would not be representative of six, its number of superfices, but of
*seven*; and a dodecahedron, not of twelve, but of *thirteen*. For, when
an untutored or primitive man like him contemplates or considers himself
or any other distinct thing, in his or its relation to space or the
surrounding directions, he notes that there is ever a front or face, a
rear or back; two sides, or a right and a left; a head and a foot, or an
above and a below; and that of and within all these, is himself or it;
that the essence of all these aspects, in anything, is the
thing-itself--that is, the thing that contains their numbers or sum, yet
is one by itself

This is indeed the very key to his conception of himself and of
everything, in relation to space and the universe or cosmos. He observes
that there are as many regions in the world as there are aspects of
himself or sides to any equally separate thing; that there are as many
directions from him or his place in the world (which is his "midmost" or
place of attachment to the Earth-mother) or from anything in the world
(which is its midmost or natural station) toward these corresponding
regions. Hence to him a plane would be symbolized not by four, but by
*five*, its four sides and directions thence, and its central self-as
was actually the notion of the Prairie tribes; a cube, not by six, but
by seven, as was the notion of the Valley-Pueblos and Navajos; a
dodecahedron, not by twelve, but by thirteen, as was the notion of the
Zuñis, the Aztecs, the Mayas, and apparently--from this example--of the
Mound builders as well.

With all that I have thus far said, I cannot yet have made clear to you
the relation this supposed connection of beings and things to their
surroundings, to the regions in front, behind, at the right and left
sides, and above, below and within them, can have to the subject under
discussion. It will therefore be necessary for me to crave your patience
while I enter a little more fully into a consideration of the beliefs of
primitive man concerning *force*, *life*, and *form*, for it will be
seen that these beliefs have a direct bearing on this apparently
fantastic and mystic meaning of the numbers *seven* and *thirteen*.

To the primitive Shaman, all force necessarily seems to be derived from
some kind of life, since he continually sees force as motion or stress
originated in, or initiated as action by, life in some form--his own, or
some other. Now the supreme characteristic or concomitant of his own or
of any other form of life, is breath, which like force or stress, is
invisible; hence he reasons that force is breath, and conversely that
breath is the force of life. He sees that this breath enters into and
issues from every living being, and since every such being has
distinctive form, he further reasons that every separate form, whether
animate in our sense or not, has life of some kind or degree. He has,
for example, no knowledge of air--as a gas--no knowledge of it other
than as wind, and no conception of wind other than as breath, as the
sort of something that he feels when he blows upon his hand and knows
absolutely that he or his own breath is blowing, and that this breath it
is that is coexistent with his mortal existence.

Therefore, he thinks not only of all forms as living, but also of the
wind as necessarily the breath of some living form or being. And since
his own little breath is so intimately of himself, he naturally imagines
that this other greater breath must needs be as intimately that of some
other and correspondingly greater and more powerful--what though
invisible--being. He also imagines that this great being of the wind
resides in the direction whence comes prevailingly its wind or its
breath. Now when he observes that there are prevailing or distinctive
winds of the diverse directions,--that of the north which blows hardest
of them all and chiefly in winter; that of the west which blows more
temperately and chiefly in spring time; that of the south, which blows
softly and most frequently in summer; that of the east, which is again
more fierce and chilly, and blows mostly in autumn; he not only
severally locates these winds in their various quarters, but also
differentiates them, and believes that the wind-being of the north
produces cold and winter; of the west, moisture and spring; of the
south, warmth, dryness and summer; of the east, coolness again, frost,
and therewith the aging or maturing of all growing things, and autumn.
And so to him the element of the north world is wind (or air, breath)
preëminently; of the west world, water; of the south world, fire; and of
the east world, earth or its seeds; and that each of these elements is
produced by or is under the dominion of the special wind-god of its
quarter; yet all combine, in the regular succession of the seasons, to
make this World of the Middle what it is from year to year . . . .

Now since the various animals are supposed, according to their kinds, to
be especially resident in one region or another, not only is there
attributed to the Great Being or God of Wind in a particular region, a
form more or less like to that of his supposed kind of animal therein,
but also, the clans are organized with reference, in turn, to the
supposed relation of their totems to these various animals and animistic
or mythic beings of the special regions. And so, when, for example, a
name is to be conferred upon a child of one of these totems, some
process of divination must be entered into to determine what shall be
his relation to the creatures and the deific being of one region or
another, and correspondingly, of course, to his fellows among the clans.
For it is held to be essential that this sacred relationship be
symbolized, in some way or another, in the choice of his totemic name,
and thus--as well as for many reasons into a consideration of which I
cannot enter here--must be divined. Now in this process of divination,
various instrumentalities are employed. For example, among the Zuñis,
wands painted in diverse colors--each color being symbolic of a special
region and plumed with appropriate bird feathers--are sometimes set up
in balls of clay, each placed out on the floor in the direction of the
region to which the color of its wand relates it. Then it is noted which
of the plumes waves most actively in any wind (or breath) that may be
stirring. From this, the spiritual relation, so to say, or the source or
totemic origin of the child is divined, and he will be named, and to a
certain extent the course of his life will be determined upon according
to this divination. For example, the Zuñi totem gods of the several
regions are: the Gray Wolf for the East or Dawn-Land; the Mountain Lion
or Puma for the North or fierce Winter-Land; the Black Bear for the Land
of the West or Night; the sun-loving Badger for the South or
Summer-Land; the Eagle for the Sky and Light, and the Burrowing Mole for
the Under-Land and Darkness. Let us suppose that the plume on the white
wand--the one that is set up toward the east--waves most actively; then,
what though the child belong to a clan or totem of one of the other
regions, he will nevertheless be regarded as *spiritually* related to
the Gray Wolf of Dawn, and it will be believed by his fellows-and with
their belief he will himself become, as he grows toward puberty, more
and more impressed--that he is destined for membership in the sacred
organization or Shamanistic Society or Lodge of the Medicine-men of the
East, or of the Wolf deity. Now when the age of puberty is attained, and
the boy is to be solemnly invested with the garment or clout and the
responsibilities of manhood, he is . . . required to pass through
various ordeals, such as a period of vigorous fasting and purification
(this both by means of emetics and purgatives); and to retire to some
lonely spot and there keep, day and night, lengthy vigils, whereby it is
sought to diminish for a time his earthly grossness, interests and
affections, to "still his heart" and quicken his spiritual perception
and hearing of the meaning of the "Silent Surpassing Ones." This is in
order that he may gain sign from or actually behold one of the Beings
who wield, in the great quarters, the forces of nature, and who shall
thereafter be his special *Tamanawa* or spiritual guide. It is also in
order to aid him in seeking for some objective sign by which this
relationship to his Genius may be proven to himself and made manifest to
his people. In a condition of exaltation as he is--and I can attest to
its absorbing nature, through having myself endured such an ordeal--you
can well understand that his perceptions will become startlingly
manifest in the various visions and signs he sees. These will seem to
him, I can again personally assure you, far more real than the most
absolutely actual things he has ever beheld or experienced. Perchance he
gazes at the mist, or a cloud in the sky. The cloud will surely seem to
take the form of a great gray wolf; and when he seeks for some token of
that God of the Sky, a tooth-like fossil, a few hairs maybe, which he
may find on the ground nearby or underneath the apparition, will be
reverently accepted as potent amulets, and he will bear them to the
tribal Fathers or Shamans, and by them they will be received as a sign
of his Genius, and he will be relegated to the phratral division or
lodge of the Wolf. Or again, it may be that he will find a crystal, and
because this crystal shines clearly and therein resembles the light by
which we see and the eye through which we see--and hence is regarded as
helpful in seeing--it will be regarded as a token of seership, as a sign
of the Seeing Spirit, and fortunate the youth who is thus supposed to be
endowed with the power of penetration into the unseen. To give yet one
more example, let us suppose that he finds a concretion exhibiting
spiral or concentric lines. He will regard this as a symbol of the
Midmost itself, a token of his relation thereto also--no matter to what
totem he may belong, or to what region he may be related by birth. For
the spiral lines perceived in this crystal resemble those of the marks
upon the sand produced by the whirling about of objects like red-topped
grass by the whirlwind, yet which are regarded as the tracks of the
whirlwind god, whose breath is the midmost of all the winds of the
world.

Permit me to here give parenthetically a striking illustration of the
way in which these primitive Shamans personify phenomena of nature, by
instancing their personification of this god of the whirlwind. Of all
the winds of heaven, the whirlwind alone is upright--progresses as man
does, by walking over the plains. The whirlwind god is therefore endowed
in part, with the personality of a man; but like the eagle, also, the
whirlwind flies aloft and circles widely in the sky; therefore he is
endowed with the wings and tail, the head, beak and talons of an eagle.
Since the sand which he, the whirlwind, casts about pricks the face as
would minute arrows, the dreadful wings of the god are supposed to be
flinty, and his character warlike or destructive, as is that of the
eagle; yet of all the Beings of Wind, he is the most potent, for he
twists about or banishes utterly from his trail, either the north wind
or the south, the east wind or the west, and overcomes even gravity--the
pulling-breath of the earth or under world--and therefore is the god of
the midmost among all the six gods of wind. Thus, lucky in a purely
practical way, is he who finds under given auspicious circumstances, his
name-token in the shape of a little concentric concretion, for he will
be in the line of ordination thereby, to the Central Council or
Priesthood of his people. . . .

Now I have gone a long way around the subject in hand, in order to
measurably substantiate my reasons for thinking that Dr. Morris is
correct in his hypothesis as to the sacred and symbolic character and
origin of the pentagonal dodecahedron which he has exhibited and
commented upon here to-night. A figure even as elaborate and difficult
of production in stone as is this, could readily have been formed by
Indian artisans. Its shape might have been suggested in the process,
perfectly familiar to them, of knapping a block or cube of stone, and
afterwards breaking away its angles by battering, to form a sphere; or,
better still, by the shapes of balls of clay--naturally formed round in
the hands--and used as by the Zuñis in their processes of
name-divination just described; or again, by the shapes of pentagonal or
other like--ever sacred--crystals. The scratchings or figures observed
upon the various faces of this stone are quite such as might well have
been drawn to differentiate them as being related to one region or
another, and in all probability the figures thus scratched were further
marked with pigments symbolic of the different regions, when this stone
was used in such processes of divination. Close observation of the more
distinct lines of these figures on the faces of the stone, shows that
they were made by a flint point, not a metal instrument; for they are
double,--that is within each one is a minute bead such as would be
produced by the fracturing of a fine point of flint or other hard
concoidal stone when drawn over the surface of another stone like
this,--and not simply V-shaped as would have been the case had a metal
instrument been used.

Some question may arise in the minds of those who have listened to Dr.
Morris' paper, and to my comments thereon, as to the meaning of the
twelve faces in this particular specimen; since, as I have explained
there are only six regions, the north, west, south, east, upper and
lower, that the midmost is at once surrounded by and contains within,
itself. But I failed to say earlier and in the proper connection, that
to the primitive-minded man, as there is no form without life, so there
is no life-form, without due duality of origin--the father and the
mother. Consequently we find that in relation to all things, (with
tribes of primitive peoples like the Zuñis of to-day, and like the mound
builders of long ago, who possessed and reverenced this object), the
sexenary division is duplicated; but since there can be only one middle
or content, the sexenary division is with them symbolized by the number
seven, and when duplicated, we have, not fourteen, but thirteen; that
is, six pairs which are visible, but only one for the concentric or
synthetic middle, since there can be but one actual centre or middle to
anything, even to the great world.
