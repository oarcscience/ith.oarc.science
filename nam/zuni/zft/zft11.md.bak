# HOW ÁHAIYÚTA AND MÁTSAILÉMA STOLE THE THUNDER-STONE AND THE LIGHTNING-SHAFT

Áhaiyúta and Mátsailéma, with their grandmother, lived where now stands
the ancient Middle Place of Sacrifice on Thunder Mountain.

One day they went out hunting prairie-dogs, and while they were running
about from one prairie-dog village to another, it began to rain, which
made the trail slippery and the ground muddy, so that the boys became a
little wrathful. Then they sat down and cursed the rain for a brief
space. Off in the south it thundered until the earth trembled, and the
lightning-shafts flew about the red-bordered clouds until the two
brothers were nearly blinded with the beholding of it. Presently the
younger brother smoothed his brow, and jumped up with an exclamation
somewhat profane, and cried out: "Elder brother, let us go to the Land
of Everlasting Summer and steal from the gods in council their thunder
and lightning. I think it would be fine fun to do that sort of thing we
have just been looking at and listening to."

The elder brother was somewhat more cautious; still, on the whole, he
liked the idea. So he said

"Let us take our prairie-dogs home to the grandmother, that she shall
have something to eat meanwhile, and we will think about going tomorrow
morning."

{p. 176}

The next morning, bright and early, they started out. In vain the old
grandmother called rather crossly after them: "Where are you going now?"
She could get no satisfaction, for she knew they lied when they called
back: "Oh, we are only going to hunt more prairie-dogs." It is true that
they skulked round in the plains about Thunder Mountain a little while,
as if looking for prairie-dogs. Then, picking up their wondrously swift
heels, they sped away toward that beautiful country of the corals, the
Land of Everlasting Summer.

At last,--it may be in the mountains of that country, which are said to
glow like shells of the sea or the clouds of the sunset,--they came to
the House of the Beloved Gods themselves. And that red house was a
wondrous terrace, rising wall after wall, and step after step, like a
high mountain, grand and stately; and the walls were so smooth and high
that the skill and power of the little War-gods availed them nothing;
they could not get in.

"What shall we do?" asked the younger brother.

"Go home," said the elder, "and mind our own affairs."

"Oh, no," urged the younger I have it, elder brother. Let us hunt up our
grandfather, the Centipede."

"Good!" replied the elder. "A happy thought is that of yours, my brother
younger."

Forthwith they laid down their bows and quivers of mountain-lion skin,
their shields, and other things, and set about turning over all the flat
stones

{p. 177}

they could find. Presently, lifting one with their united strength, they
found under it the very old fellow they sought. He doubled himself, and
covered his eyes from the sharpness of the daylight. He did not much
like being thus disturbed, even by his grandchildren, the War-gods, in
the middle of his noonday nap, and was by no means polite to them. But
they prodded him a little in the side, and said: "Now, grandfather, look
here! We are in difficulty, and there is no one in the wide world who
can help us out as you will."

The old Centipede was naturally flattered. He unrolled himself and
viewed them with a look which he intended to be extremely reproachful
and belittling. "Ah, my grandchildren," said he, "what are you up to
now? Are you trying to get yourselves into trouble, as usual? No doubt
of it! I will help you all I can; but the consequences be on your own
heads!"

"That's right, grandfather, that's right! No one in the world could help
us as you can," said one of them. "The fact is, we want to get hold of
the thunder-stone and the lightning-shaft which the Rain-gods up there
in the tremendous house keep and guard so carefully, we understand. Now,
in the first place, we cannot get up the wall; in the second place, if
we did, we would probably have a fuss with them in trying to steal these
things. Therefore, we want you to help us, if you will."

"With all my heart, my boys! But I should advise you to run along home
to your grandmother, and let these things alone."

{p. 178}

"Oh, pshaw, nonsense! We are only going to play a little while with the
thunder and lightning."

"All right," replied the old Worm; "sit here and wait for me." He
wriggled himself and stirred about, and his countless legs were more
countless than ever with rapid motions as he ran toward the walls of
that stately terrace. A vine could not have run up more closely, nor a
bird more rapidly; for if one foot slipped, another held on; so the old
Centipede wriggled himself up the sides and over the roof, down into the
great skyhole; and, scorning the ladder, which he feared might creak, he
went along, head-downward, on the ceiling to the end of the room over
the altar, ran down the side, and approached that most forbidden of
places, the altar of the gods themselves. The beloved gods, in silent
majesty, were sitting there with their heads bowed in meditation so deep
that they heard not the faint scuffle of the Centipede's feet as he
wound himself down into the altar and stole the thunder-stone. He took
it in his mouth--which was larger than the mouths of Centipedes are
now--and carried it silently, weighty as it was, up the way he had come,
over the roof, down the wall, and back to the flat stone where he made
his home, and where, hardly able to contain themselves with impatience,
the two youthful gods were awaiting him.

"Here he comes!" cried the younger brother, "and he's got it! By my
war-bonnet, he's got it!"

The old grandfather threw the stone down. It began to sound, but
Áhaiyúta grabbed it, and,

{p. 179}

as it were, throttled its world-stirring speech. "Good! good!" he cried
to the grandfather; "thank you, old grandfather, thank you!"

"Hold on!" cried the younger brother; "you didn't bring both. What can
we do with the one without the other?"

"Shut up!" cried the old Worm. "I know what I am about!" And before they
could say any more he was off again. Ere long he returned, carrying the
shaft of lightning, with its blue, shimmering point, in his mouth.

"Good!" cried the War-gods. And the younger brother caught up the
lightning, and almost forgot his weapons, which, however, he did stop to
take up, and started on a full run for Thunder Mountain, followed by his
more deliberate, but equally interested elder brother, who brought along
the thunder-stone, which he found a somewhat heavier burden than he had
supposed.

It was not long, you may well imagine, so powerful were these Gods of
War, ere they reached the home of their grandmother on the top of
Thunder Mountain. They had carefully concealed the thunder-stone and the
shaft of lightning meanwhile, and had taken care to provide themselves
with a few prairie-dogs by way of deception.

Still, in majestic revery, unmoved, and apparently unwitting of what had
taken place, sat the Rain-gods in their home in the mountains of
Summerland.

Not long after they arrived, the young gods began to grow curious and
anxious to try their

{p. 180}

new playthings. They poked one another considerably, and whispered a
great deal, so that their grandmother began to suspect they were about
to play some rash joke or other, and presently she espied the point of
lightning gleaming under Mátsailéma's dirty jacket.

"Demons and corpses!" she cried. "By the moon! You have stolen the
thunder-stone and lightning-shaft from the Gods of Rain themselves! Go
this instant and return them, and never do such a thing again!" she
cried, with the utmost severity; and, making a quick step for the
fireplace, she picked up a poker with which to belabor their backs, when
they whisked out of the room and into another. They slammed the door in
their grandmother's face and braced it, and, clearing away a lot of
rubbish that was lying around the rear room, they established themselves
in one end, and, nodding and winking at one another, cried out: "Now,
then!" The younger let go the lightning-shaft; the elder rolled the
thunder-stone. The lightning hissed through the air, and far out into
the sky, and returned. The thunder-stone rolled and rumbled until it
shook the foundations of the mountain. "Glorious fun!" cried the boys,
rubbing their thighs in ecstasy of delight. "Do it again!" And again
they sent forth the lightning and rolled the thunder-stone.

And now the gods in Summerland arose in their majesty and breathed upon
the skies; and the winds rose, and the rains fell like rivers from the
clouds, centering their violence upon the roof of

{p. 181}

the poor old grandmother's house. Heedlessly those reckless wretches
kept on playing the thunder-stone and lightning-shaft without the
slightest regard to the tremendous commotion they were raising all
through the skies and all over Thunder Mountain; but nowhere else as
above the house where their poor old grandmother lived fell the torrent
of the rain, and there alone, of course, burst the lightning and rolled
the thunder.

Soon the water poured through the roof of the house; but, move the
things as the old grandmother would, she could not keep them dry; scold
the boys as she would, she could not make them desist. No, they would
only go on with their play more violently than ever, exclaiming: "What
has she to say, anyway? It won't hurt her to get a good ducking, and
this is fun!" By-and-by the waters rose so high that they extinguished
the fire. Soon they rose still higher, so that the War-gods had to
paddle around half submerged. Still they kept rolling the thunder-stone
and shooting the lightning. The old grandmother scolded harder and
harder, but after awhile desisted and climbed to the top of the
fireplace, whence, after recovering from her exertion, she began again.
But the boys heeded her not, only saying: "Let her yell! Let her scold!
This is fun!" At last they began to take the old grandmother's scolding
as a matter of course, and allowed nothing but the water to interrupt
their pastime. It rose so high, finally, that they were near drowning.
Then they climbed to the roof, but still they kept on.

{p. 182}

"By the bones of the dead! why did we not think to come here before? 'T
is ten times as fine up here. See him shoot!" cried one to the other, as
the lightning sped through the sky, ever returning.

"Hear it mutter and roll!" cried the other, as the thunder bellowed and
grumbled.

But no sooner had the Two begun their sport on the roof, than the rain
fell in one vast sheet all about them; and it was not long ere the house
was so full that the old grandmother--locked in as she was--bobbed her
poor pate on the rafters in trying to keep it above the water. She
gulped water, and gasped, coughed, strangled, and shrieked to no
purpose.

"What a fuss our old grandmother is making, to be sure!" cried the boys.
And they kept on, until, forsooth, the water had completely filled the
room, and the grandmother's cries gurgled away and ceased. Finally, the
thunder-stone grew so terrific, and the lightning so hot and
unmanageable, that the boys, drawing a long breath and thinking with
immense satisfaction of the fun they had had, possibly also influenced
as to the safety of the house, which was beginning to totter, flung the
thunder-stone and the lightning-shaft into the sky, where, rattling and
flashing away, they finally disappeared over the mountains in the south.

Then the clouds rolled away and the sun shone out, and the boys, wet to
the skin, tired in good earnest, and hungry as well, looked around.
"Goodness! the water is running out of the

{p. 183}

windows of our house! This is a pretty mess we are in Grandmother!
Grandmother!" they shouted. Open the door, and let us in!" But the old
grandmother had piped her last, and never a sound came except that of
flowing water. They sat themselves down on the roof, and waited for the
water to get lower. Then they climbed down, and pounded open the door,
and the water came out with a rush, and out with a rush, too, their poor
old grandmother,--her eyes staring, her hair all mopped and muddied, and
her fingers and legs as stiff as cedar sticks.

"Oh, ye gods! ye gods!" the two boys exclaimed; "we have killed our own
grandmother--poor old grandmother, who scolded us so hard and loved us
so much! Let us bury her here in front of the door, as soon as the water
has run away."

So, as soon as it became dry enough, there they buried her; and in less
than four days a strange plant grew up on that spot, and on its little
branches, amid its bright green leaves, hung long, pointed pods of
fruit, as red as the fire on the breast of the red-bird.

"It is well," said the boys, as they stood one day looking at this
plant. "Let us scatter the seeds abroad, that men may find and plant
them. It seems it was not without good cause that in the abandonment to
our sport we killed our old grandmother, for out of her heart there
sprung a plant into the fruits of which, as it were, has flowed the
color as well as the fire of her scolding tongue; and, if we have lost
our grandmother, whom we

{p. 184}

loved much, but who loved us more, men have gained a new food, which,
though it burn them, shall please them more than did the heat of her
discourse please us. Poor old grandmother! Men will little dream when
they eat peppers that the seed of them first arose from the fiery heart
of the grandmother of Áhaiyúta and Mátsailéma."

Thereupon the two seized the pods and crushed them between their hands,
with an exclamation of pleasure at the brisk odor they gave forth. They
cast the seeds abroad, which seeds here and there took root; and the
plants which sprang from them being found by men, were esteemed good and
were cultivated, as they are to this day in the pepper gardens of Zuñi.

Ever since this time you hear that mountain wherein lived the gods with
their grandmother called Thunder Mountain; and often, indeed, to this
day, the lightning flashes and the thunder plays over its brows and the
rain falls there most frequently.

It is said by some that the two boys, when asked how they stole the
lightning-shaft and the thunder-stone, told on their poor old
grandfather, the Centipede. The beloved Gods of the Rain gave him the
lightning-shaft to handle in another way, and it so burned and
shrivelled him that he became small, as you can see by looking at any of
his numerous descendants, who are not only small but appear like a
well-toasted bit of buckskin, fringed at the edges.

So shortens my story.
