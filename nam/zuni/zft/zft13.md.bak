# HOW THE COYOTE JOINED THE DANCE OF THE BURROWING-OWLS

You may know the country that lies south of the valley in which our town
stands. You travel along the trail which winds round the hill our
ancients called *Ishana-tak'yapon*,--which means the Hill of Grease, for
the rocks sometimes shine in the light of the sun at evening, and it is
said that strange things occurred there in the days of the ancients,
which makes them thus to shine, while rocks of the kind in other places
do not,--you travel on up this trail, crossing over the arroyos and
foot-hills of the great mesa called Middle Mountain, until you come to
the foot of the cliffs. Then you climb up back and forth, winding round
and round, until you reach the top of the mountain, which is as flat as
the floor of a house, merely being here and there traversed by small
valleys covered with piñon and cedar, and threaded by trails made not
only by the feet of our people but by deer and other animals. And so you
go on and on, until, hardly knowing it, you have descended from the top
of Middle Mountain, and found yourself in a wide plain covered with
grass, and here and there clumps of trees. Beyond this valley is an
elevated sandy plain, rather sunken in the middle, so that when it rains
the water filters down into the soil of the depressed portion (which is
wide enough to be a country in itself) and

{p. 204}

nourishes the grasses there; so that most of the year they grow green
and sweet.

Now, a long, long time ago, in this valley or basin there lived a
village of Prairie-dogs, on fairly peaceable terms with Rattlesnakes,
Adders, Chameleons, Horned-toads, and Burrowing-owls. With the Owls they
were especially friendly, looking at them as creatures of great gravity
and sanctity. For this reason these Prairie-dogs and their companions
never disturbed the councils or ceremonies of the Burrowing-owls, but
treated them most respectfully, keeping at a distance from them when
their dances were going on.

It chanced one day that the Burrowing-owls were having a great dance all
to themselves, rather early in the morning. The dance they were engaged
in was one peculiarly prized by them, requiring no little dexterity in
its execution. Each dancer, young man or maiden, carried upon his or her
head a bowl of foam, and though their legs were crooked and their
motions disjointed, they danced to the whistling of some and the
clapping beaks of others, in perfect unison, and with such dexterity
that they never spilled a speck of the foam on their sleek mantles of
dun-black feather-work.

It chanced this morning of the Foam-dance that a Coyote was nosing about
for Grasshoppers and Prairie-dogs. So quite naturally he was prowling
around the by-streets in the borders of the Prairie-dog town. His house
where he lived with his old grandmother stood back to the westward, just
over the elevations that bounded Sunken Country, among

{p. 205}

the rocks. He heard the click-clack of the musicians and their shrill,
funny little song:

"I yami hota utchu tchapikya,  
        Tokos! tokos! tokos! tokos!

So he pricked up his ears, and lifting his tail, trotted forward toward
the level place between the hillocks and doorways of the village, where
the Owls were dancing in a row. He looked at them with great curiosity,
squatting on his haunches, the more composedly to observe them. Indeed,
he became so much interested and amused by their shambling motions and
clever evolutions, that he could no longer contain his curiosity. So he
stepped forward, with a smirk and a nod toward the old master of
ceremonies, and said: "My father, how are you and your children these
many days?"

"Contented and happy, "replied the old Owl, turning his attention to the
dancing again.

"Yes, but I observe you are dancing," said the Coyote. "A very fine
dance, upon my word! Charming! Charming! And why should you be dancing
if you were not contented and happy, to be sure?"

"We are dancing," responded the Owl, "both for our pleasure and for the
good of the town."

"True, true," replied the Coyote; "but what's that which looks like foam
these dancers are carrying on their heads, and why do they dance in so
limping a fashion?"

"You see, my friend," said the Owl, turning toward the Coyote, "we hold
this to be a very

{p. 206}

sacred performance--very sacred indeed. Being such, these my children
are initiated and so trained in the mysteries of the sacred society of
which this is a custom that they can do very strange things in the
observance of our ceremonies. You ask what it is that looks like foam
they are balancing on their heads. Look more closely, friend. Do you not
observe that it is their own grandmothers' heads they have on, the
feathers turned white with age?"

"By my eyes!" exclaimed the Coyote, blinking and twitching his whiskers;
"it seems so."

"And you ask also why they limp as they dance," said the Owl. "Now, this
limp is essential to the proper performance of our dance--so essential,
in fact, that in order to attain to it these my children go through the
pain of having their legs broken. Instead of losing by this, they gain
in a great many ways. Good luck always follows them. They are quite as
spry as they were before, and enjoy, moreover, the distinction of
performing a dance which no other people or creatures in the world are
capable of!"

"Dust and devils!" ejaculated the Coyote. "This is passing strange. A
most admirable dance, upon my word! Why, every bristle on my body keeps
time to the music and their steps! Look here, my friend, don't you think
that I could learn that dance?"

"Well," replied the old Owl; "it is rather hard to learn, and you
haven't been initiated, you know; but, still, if you are determined that
you

{p. 207}

would like to join the dance--by the way, have you a grandmother?"

"Yes, and a fine old woman she is," said he, twitching his mouth in the
direction of his house. "She lives there with me. I dare say she is
looking after my breakfast now."

"Very well," continued the old Owl, "if you care to join in our dance,
fulfill the conditions, and I think we can receive you into our order."
And he added, aside: "The silly fool; the sneaking, impertinent wretch!
I will teach him to be sticking that sharp nose of his into other
people's affairs!"

"All right! All right!" cried the Coyote, excitedly. "Will it last
long?"

"Until the sun is so bright that it hurts our eyes," said the Owl; "a
long time yet."

"All right! All right! I'll be back in a little while," said the Coyote;
and, switching his tail into the air, away he ran toward his home. When
he came to the house, he saw his old grandmother on the roof, which was
a rock beside his hole, gathering fur from some skins which he had
brought home, to make up a bed for the Coyote's family.

"Ha, my blessed grandmother!" said the Coyote, "by means of your aid,
what a fine thing I shall be able to do!"

The old woman was singing to herself when the Coyote dashed up to the
roof where she was sitting, and, catching up a convenient leg-bone,
whacked her over the pate and sawed her head off with the teeth of a
deer. All bloody and soft as it was, he clapped it on his own head and
raised himself on

{p. 208}

his hind-legs, bracing his tail against the ground, and letting his paws
drop with the toes outspread, to imitate as nearly as possible the
drooping wings of the dancing Owls. He found that it worked very well;
so, descending with the head in one paw and a stone in the other, he
found a convenient sharp-edged rock, and, laying his legs across it, hit
them a tremendous crack with the stone, which broke them, to be sure,
into splinters.

"Beloved Powers! Oh!" howled the Coyote. "Oh-o-o-o-o! the dance may be a
fine thing, but the initiation is anything else!"

However, with his faith unabated, he shook himself together and got up
to walk. But he could walk only with his paws; his hind-legs dragged
helplessly behind him. Nevertheless, with great pain, and getting weaker
and weaker every step of the way, he made what haste he could back to
the Prairie-dog town, his poor old grandmother's head slung over his
shoulders.

When he approached the dancers,--for they were still dancing,--they
pretended to be greatly delighted with their proselyte, and greeted him,
notwithstanding his rueful countenance, with many congratulatory
epithets, mingled with very proper and warm expressions of welcome. The
Coyote looked sick and groaned occasionally and kept looking around at
his feet, as though he would like to lick them. But the old Owl extended
his wing and cautioned him not to interfere with the working power of
faith in this essential observance, and invited him (with a *hem* that
very much resembled

{p. 209}

a suppressed giggle), to join in their dance. The Coyote smirked and
bowed and tried to stand up gracefully on his stumps, but fell over, his
grandmother's head rolling around in the dirt. He picked up the grisly
head, clapped it on his crown again and raised himself, and with many a
howl, which he tried in vain to check, began to prance around; but ere
long tumbled over again. The Burrowing-owls were filled with such
merriment at his discomfiture that they laughed until they spilled the
foam all down their backs and bosoms; and, with a parting fling at the
Coyote which gave him to understand that he had made a fine fool of
himself, and would know better than to pry into other people's business
next time, skipped away to a safe distance from him.

Then, seeing how he had been tricked, the Coyote fell to howling and
clapping his thighs; and, catching sight of his poor grandmother's head,
all bloody and begrimed with dirt, he cried out in grief and anger:
"Alas! alas! that it should have come to this! You little devils! I'll
be even with you! I'll smoke you out of your holes."

"What will you smoke us out with?" tauntingly asked the Burrowing-owls.

"Ha! you'll find out. With yucca!"

"O! O! ha! ha!" laughed the Owls. That is our succotash!"

"Ah, well! I'll smoke you out!" yelled the Coyote, stung by their
taunts.

"What with?" cried the Owls.

"Grease-weed."

{p. 210}

"He, ha! ho, ho! We make our mush-stew of that!"

"Ha! but I'll smoke you out, nevertheless, you little beasts!"

"What with? What with?" shouted the Owls.

"Yellow-top weeds," said he.

"Ha, ha! All right; smoke away! We make our sweet gruel with that, you
fool!"

"I'll fix you! I'll smoke you out! I'll suffocate the very last one of
you!"

"What with? What with?" shouted the Owls, skipping around on their
crooked feet.

"Pitch-pine," snarled the Coyote.

This frightened the Owls, for pitch-pine, even to this day, is sickening
to them. Away they plunged into their holes, pell-mell.

Then the Coyote looked at his poor old grandmother's begrimed and bloody
head, and cried out--just as Coyotes do now at sunset, I suppose--"Oh,
my poor, poor grandmother! So this is what they have caused me to do to
you!" And, tormented both by his grief and his pain, he took up the head
of his grandmother and crawled back as best he could to his house.

When he arrived there he managed to climb up to the roof, where her body
lay stiff. He chafed her legs and sides, and washed the blood and dirt
from her head, and got a bit of sinew, and sewed her head to her body as
carefully as he could and as hastily. Then he opened her mouth, and,
putting his muzzle to it, blew into her throat, in the hope of
resuscitating her; but the wind only leaked

{p. 211}

out from the holes in her neck, and she gave no signs of animation. Then
the Coyote mixed some pap of fine toasted meal and water and poured it
down her throat, addressing her with vehement expressions of regret at
what he had done, and apology and solicitation that she should not mind,
as he didn't mean it, and imploring her to revive. But the pap only
trickled out between the stitches in her neck, and she grew colder and
stiffer all the while; so that at last the Coyote gave it up, and,
moaning, he betook himself to a near clump of piñon trees, intent upon
vengeance and designing to gather pitch with which to smoke the Owls to
death. But, weakened by his injuries, and filled with grief and shame
and mortification, when he got there he could only lie down.

He was so engrossed in howling and thinking of his woes and pains that a
Horned-toad, who saw him, and who hated him because of the insults he
had frequently suffered from him and his kind, crawled into the throat
of the beast without his noticing it. Presently the little creature
struck up a song:

"Tsakina muuu-ki  
    Iyami Kushina tsoiyakya  
        Aisiwaiki muki, muki,  
            Muuu ka!"

"Ah-a-a-a-a-a," the Coyote was groaning. But -when he heard this song,
apparently far off, and yet so near, he felt very strangely inside, so
he thought and no doubt wondered if it were the song

{p. 212}

of some musician. At any rate, he lifted his head and looked all around,
but hearing nothing, lay down again and bemoaned his fate.

Then the Horned-toad sang again. This time the Coyote called out
immediately, and the Horned-toad answered: "Here I am. "But look as he
would, the Coyote could not find the Toad. So he listened for the song
again, and heard it, and asked who it was that was singing. The
Horned-toad replied that it was he. But still the Coyote could not find
him. A fourth time the Horned-toad sang, and the Coyote began to suspect
that it was under him. So he lifted himself to see; and one of the
spines on the Horned-toad's neck pricked him, and at the same time the
little fellow called out: "Here I am, you idiot, inside of you! I came
upon you here, and being a medicine-man of some prominence, I thought I
would explore your vitals and see what was the matter."

"By the souls of my ancestors!" exclaimed the Coyote, "be careful what
you do in there!"

The Horned-toad replied by laying his hand on the Coyote's liver, and
exclaiming: "What is this I feel?"

"Where?" said the Coyote.

"Down here."

"Merciful daylight! it is my liver, without which no one can have
solidity of any kind, or a proper vitality. Be very careful not to
injure that; if you do, I shall die at once, and what will become of my
poor wife and children?"

Then the Horned-toad climbed up to the stomach

{p. 213}

of the Coyote. "What is this, my friend?" said he, feeling the sides of
the Coyote's food-bag.

"What is it like?" asked the Coyote.

"Wrinkled, "said the Horned-toad, "and filled with a fearful mess of
stuff!"

"Oh! mercy! mercy! good daylight! My precious friend, be very careful!
That is the very source of my being--my stomach itself!"

"Very well," said the Horned-toad. Then he moved on somewhat farther and
touched the heart of the Coyote, which startled him fearfully. "What is
this?" cried the Horned-toad.

"Mercy, mercy! what are you doing?" exclaimed the Coyote.

"Nothing--feeling of your vitals," was the reply. "What is it?"

"Oh, what is it like?" said the Coyote.

"Shaped like a pine-nut, "said the Horned-toad, "as nearly as I can make
out; it keeps leaping so."

"Leaping, is it?" howled the Coyote. "Mercy! my friend, get away from
there! That is the very heart of my being, the thread that ties my
existence, the home of my emotions, and my knowledge of daylight. Go
away from there, do, I pray you! If you should scratch it ever so
little, it would be the death of me, and what would my wife and children
do?"

"Hey!" said the Horned-toad, "you wouldn't be apt to insult me and my
people any more if I touched you up there a little, would you?" And he
hooked one of his horns into the Coyote's heart. {p. 214} The Coyote
gave one gasp, straightened out his limbs, and expired.

"Ha, ha! you villain! Thus would you have done to me, had you found the
chance; thus unto you"--saying which he found his way out and sought the
nearest water-pocket he could find.

So you see from this, which took place in the days of the ancients, it
may be inferred that the instinct of meddling with everything that did
not concern him, and making a universal nuisance of himself, and
desiring to imitate everything that he sees, ready to jump into any trap
that is laid for him, is a confirmed instinct with the Coyote, for those
are precisely his characteristics today.

Furthermore, Coyotes never insult Horned-toads nowadays, and they keep
clear of Burrowing-owls. And ever since then the Burrowing-owls have
been speckled with gray and white all over their backs and bosoms,
because their ancestors spilled foam over themselves in laughing at the
silliness of the Coyote.

Thus shortens my story.
