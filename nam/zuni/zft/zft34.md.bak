# THE GIANT CLOUD-SWALLOWER

## A TALE OF CAÑON DE CHELLY

### TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION

Deep down in cañons of the Southwest, especially where they are joined
by other cañons, the traveller may see standing forth from or hugging
the angles of the cliffs, great towering needles of stone--weird,
rugged, fantastic, oftentimes single, as often--like gigantic
wind-stripped trees with lesser trees standing beside them--double or
treble. Seen suddenly at a turn in the cañon these giant stones startle
the gazer with their monstrous and human proportions, like giants,
indeed, at bay against the sheer rock walls, protecting their young, who
appear anon to crouch at the knees of their fathers or cling to their
sides.

Few white men behold these statuesque stones in the moonlight, or in the
gray light and white mists of the morning. At midday they seem dead or
asleep while standing; but when the moon is shining above them and the
wanderer below looks up to them, lo! the moon stands still and these
mighty crags start forth, advancing noiselessly. His back is frozen, and
even in the yielding sand his feet are held fast by terror--a delicious,
ghostly terror, withal! Still he gazes fascinated, and as the shadow of
the moonlight falls toward him over the topmost crest, lo, again! its
crown is illumined and circled as if by a halo of snow-light, and back
and forth from this luminous fillet over that high stony brow, black
hair seems to tumble and gather.

Again, beheld in the dawn-light, when the mists are rising slowly and
are waving to and fro around the giddy

{p. 424}

columns, hiding the cliffs behind them, these vast pinnacles seem to nod
and to waver or to sway themselves backward and forward, all as silently
as before. Soon, when the sun is risen and the mists from below fade
away, the wind blows more mist from the mesa; you see clouds of it pour
from the cliff edge, just behind and above these great towers, and
shimmer against the bright sky; but as soon as these clouds pass the
crag-nests they are lost in the sunlight around them-lost so fast, as
yet others come on, that the stone giants seem to drink them.

Of such rocks, according to their variety and local surroundings, the
Zuñis relate many tales which are so ingenious and befitting that if we
believed, as the Zuñis do, that in the time of creation when all things
were young and soft and were therefore easily fashioned by whatever
chanced to befall them--into this thing or that thing, into this plant
or that plant, this animal or that, and so on endlessly through a
dramatic story longer than Shakespeare or the Bible--we would fain
believe also as he does in the quaint incidents of these stories of the
time when all things were new and the world was becoming as we see it
now.

One of these tales, a variant of others pertaining to particular
standing rocks in the west, south, or east, is told of that wonder to
all beholders, "El Capitan," of the Canon de Chelly in the north. No one
who has seen this stupendous rock column can fail to be interested in
the following legend, or will fail to realize how, as this introduction
endeavors to make plainer, the Zuñi poet and philosopher of olden times
built up a story which he verily believed quite sufficient to account
for the great shaft of sandstone and its many details and
surroundings.--F. H. C.

Häki Suto, or Foretop Knot, he whose hair was done up over his forehead
like a quail's crest, lived among the great cliffs of the north long
ago, when the world was new. He was a giant, so tall that

{p. 425}

men called him *Lo Ikwithltchunona*, or the Cloud-swallower. A devourer
of men was he,--men were his meat--yea, and a drinker of their very
substance was he, for the cloud-breaths of the beloved gods, and souls
of the dead, whence descend rains, even these were his drink. Wherefore
the People of the Cliffs sought to slay him, and hero after hero
perished thuswise. Wherefore, too, snow ceased in the north and the
west; rain ceased in the south and the east; the mists of the mountains
above were drunk up; the waters of the valleys below were dried up; corn
withered in the fields; men hungered and died in the cliffs.

Then came the Twin Gods of War, Áhaiyúta and Mátsailéma, who in play
staked the lives of foes and fierce creatures. "Lo! it is not well with
our children, men," said they. "Let us destroy this Häki Suto, the
swallower of clouds," said they.

They were walking along the trail which leads southward to the
Smooth-rocks-descending.

"O, grandchildren, where be ye wending?" said a little, little quavering
voice. They looked,--the younger, then the elder. There on the tip of a
grass-stalk, waving her banner of down-stuff, stood their grandmother,
Spinner of Meshes.

"The Spider! Our Grandmother Spider!" cried one of the gods to the
other. "Ho! grandmother, was that you calling?" shouted they to her.

"Yea, children; where wend ye this noon-day?

"A-warring we are going," said they. "Look now!"

"No beads for to broider your awning  
Have fallen this many a morning."

{p. 426}

"Aha, wait ye! Whom ye seek, verily I know him well," said the
Spider-woman.

"Like a tree fallen down from the mountain  
He lies by the side of the cliff-trail  
And feigns to sleep there, yet is wary.  
I will sew up his eyes with my down-cords.  
Then come ye and smite him, grandchildren."

She ran ahead. There lay Häki Suto, his legs over the trail where men
journeyed. Great, like the trunks and branches of pine trees cast down
by a wind-storm, were his legs arching over the pathway, and when some
one chanced to come by, the giant would call out: "Good morning!" and
bid him "pass right along under." "I am old and rheumatic," he would
continue, oh, so politely! "Do not mind my rudeness, therefore; run
right along under; never fear, run right along under!" But when the
hunter tried to pass, *kúutsu!* Häki Suto would snatch him up and cast
him over the cliff to be eaten by the young Forehead-cresters.

The Spider stepped never so lightly, and climbed up behind his great
ear, and then busily wove at her web, to and fro, up and down, and in
and out of his eyelashes she busily plied at her web.

"Pesk the birds and buzz creatures!" growled the giant, twitching this
way and that his eyebrows. which tickled; but he would not stir,--for he
heard the War-gods coming, and thought them fat hunters and needs must
feign sleepy.

"And these? Ha! ha! They begin to sing, as was their fearless wont
sometimes. Häki Suto

{p. 427}

never looked, but yawned and drawled as they came near, and nearer.
"Never mind, my children, pass right along under, pass right along
under; I am lame and tired this morning," said he.

Áhaiyúta ran to the left. Mátsailéma ran to the right. Häki Suto sprang
up to catch them, but his eyes were so blinded with cobwebs that he
missed them and feigned to fall, crying: "Ouch! my poor back! my poor
back! Pass right along under, my children, it was only a crick in my
back. Ouch! Oh, my poor back!" But they whacked him over the head and
stomach till he stiffened and died. Then shouting "*So ho!*" they shoved
him over the Cliff.

The Navahos say that the grandmother tied him there by the hair--by his
topknot--where you see the white streaks on the pillar, so they say; but
it 's the birds that streak the pillar, and this is the way. When Häki
Suto fell, his feet drave far into the sands, and the Storm-gods rushed
in to the aid of their children, the War-gods, and drifted his
blood-bedrenched carcass all over with sand, whence he dried and
hardened to stone. When the young ones saw him falling, they forthwith
flocked up to devour him, making loud clamor. But the Twain, seeing
this, made after them too and twisted the necks of all save only the
tallest (who was caught in the sands with his father) and flung them
aloft to the winds, whereby one became instantly the Owl, who twists her
head wholly around whensoever she pleases, and stares as though
frightened and strangled; and another the Falcon became, who

{p. 428}

perches and nests to this day on the crest of his sand-covered father,
the Giant Cloud-drinker. And the Falcons cry ever and ever "'Tis father;
O father!" ("*Tí-tätchu ya-tätchu.*")

But, fearing that never again would the waters refreshen their cañons,
our ancients who dwelt in the cliffs fled away to the southward and
eastward--all save those who had perished aforetime; they are dead in
their homes in the cliff-towns, dried, like their cornstalks that died
when the rain stopped long, long ago, when all things were new.

Thus shortens my story.
