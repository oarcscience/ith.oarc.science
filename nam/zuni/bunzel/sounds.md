# Table of Zuñi Sounds

The following symbols have been used in the texts and recording of
native names in Bunzel's Zuñi papers.

Vowels

a, e, i, o, u have their continental values. As in English, long vowels
tend to be closed, short vowels to be open, but the quality is variable
and not significant. o is always closed, and is distinguished from O
which is open.

Length is indicated by a colon following the letter; both vowels and
consonants may be long. All accented syllables are lengthened, some of
the length being accorded to the terminating consonant. Where not
indicated the primary accent is on the first syllable; the secondary
accent, in words of four or more syllables, on the penult. Compound
words retain their original accents.
