### XXXV

#### FATHER'S SISTER

<span class="smallcaps">During</span> the intervals between my trips
with the Twins'-Mother, Marie visits me frequently. She seems to want
someone to whom she can talk about her mother. Atlnaba, who looks thin,
drawn, and old, often joins us. Marie goes over all the circumstances of
the illness to reason out the ultimate cause of the fatality. "The
doctor said my mother had tuberculosis, but she didn't die of that. She
wouldn't have died if she hadn't got pneumonia. About two years ago when
she was lifting a heavy load of wood, she broke a rib. It punched into
her like a knife, and she was sick after that. But that Knife Chanter
cured her. I don't think, though, that her rib ever healed right,
because she often complained of pain in that side. Then she broke it
again before you came. It got better, but she said when the singer
pressed her at that War Dance, that is when she felt it punch her lung
again."

"That is probably what caused it," I agree.

"But then she was well again after that man sang. She could walk around,
and it didn't hurt her. Then she had that sing. I think she would still
be living if she hadn't got wet. Then she gave up too; she had no more
hope."

"She always worked too hard. You know she always wanted to do more than
she should or could do. Atlnaba is like that, and so is your father—most
worth-while people are. Then

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

they overdo, and they die young. But I am sure your mother was happier
doing what she wanted to do."

"That old woman who is here, she was just coming to see my mother at the
hospital. She did not get there in time, so she has been staying with us
since then. Everybody came to see my mother. The night before she died,
Tom, his brother, and Ben Wilson all dressed up in their best clothes
and went in to see her," she states with the greatest pride, as though
greater honor was never accorded any woman.

"Did she like that?" I ask.

"Oh, yes! When she opened her eyes and saw them she smiled. She couldn't
talk much, but she said, "My sons."

"What did she call them usually?"

"She always said "my son," and they said "my mother." Of course she
should have said "my son-in-law," and they, "the one whom I do not see";
but she thought too much of them for that."

Tom comes up. It is Friday night and he is tired from a week's work. As
he smokes, I get out my photos. One of Yikadezba is especially good, and
I think of suppressing it. But they see it and scrutinize it eagerly.
Finally Tom says: "It just seems to me she is still running around and I
might see her any time. I can't believe she is gone."

I return about six-thirty one evening, tired, hot, hungry. I can hardly
tell whether it is hunger or fatigue which makes me so exhausted. A
fierce, hot, sandy wind has been blowing all day. I go to Red-Point's
shade to take a letter to Marie, and she asks with her customary
persuasiveness: "This old woman wants to go home tonight. Won't you take
her?"

It has become almost as difficult for me as for a Navajo to

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

say "No." This time, however, I do not yield. "Oh, Marie! I am just
dead. Tell her I'll take her tomorrow morning."

I have recovered after "a little coffee"; my ailment was hunger. As I
lie on my stomach on my nice woolly sheepskin I hear footsteps and the
soft murmur of voices. It is too dark for my reading. Marie and the old
woman sit near me as the darkness falls. It is too warm for a fire. The
wind has quieted after a day's fury. The stars are far away. We know one
another's whereabouts only by sounds and the flash of a cigarette.

The old woman took a fancy to me at the War Dance, and I thought she was
sweet. But she does not know me, or why I am here. "She says she thinks
it is nice you are here and one of our family. She is glad you learned
to weave, but she can't understand why you thought of coming here to
live."

I explain that white people have notions about Indians derived from
seeing them at trading-posts or in the towns, that their notions are not
particularly flattering. I was interested in learning all about their
clans, their kinship, and many other things. But I wanted most to see
what they were like at home. People say they are lazy. I did not think
that was true, because if they were they could not get so much done.
They say also that Indians are unfriendly. Well, I knew that was not
true, but I wanted to see. And besides I wanted to weave.

"You have relatives," she says. "Grandfather, sisters, and children. But
you have no father. It is good to have a father, you know." She refers
not to the fact of illegitimacy—that does not matter so much—but rather
to the Navajo custom whereby a father's clanfolk owe a particular debt
of hospitality and good will to "son's children."

"I know. I have often thought of it and thought I ought

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

to have one. But how can I do that? Have you any suggestion?"

Quick as a flash she answers: "Take your grandfather's clan for your
father's. His clan is Place-of-Walking-About, my clan is
Place-of-Walking-About; he is my brother, therefore you are my brother's
child. You call me father's-sister, I call you the same and you call my
children "cousin."

So saying, she rises and shakes hands with me, thus formally making me a
relative of hers and her children. I rise and gladly accept the neat,
spontaneous recommendation. The darkness covers my surprise.

One Friday about two weeks after Maria Antonia's death Tom announces:
"We are going to move Sunday while we have the wagons. We will start
early, and you can come later when we are settled. I have chosen a place
for you."

"Where are you moving to?" I ask.

"Not far, just down near the garden."

Now I know it is not the fear of death which makes them move. If it
were, they would not have stayed a minute, nor would they come back.
They have shown that inconveniences are nothing in the conflict with
custom and belief. If Maria Antonia's spirit were haunting this place,
it would not begin now; it would have been here for the last two weeks.
It is simply that "it seems as if she were walking around." Out of
hopeful and loving expectation comes ghastly silence; instead of natural
bustling activity there is only baffling stillness. They do not, like
us, try to "stick it"; they simply move away, leaving the disconcerting
hush to consort with the abominable quiet.
