### XXIII

#### SUN'S HOUSE

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> first day of Marie's sing is a
concentrated sample of the four days we put in cleansing ourselves and
preparing sacrifices for the various gods. The next three days are
similar except for minor variations and intensity. The early morning
paintings change a little. Horned snakes are painted on the first
morning; on the second there are straight and zigzag arrows; on the
next, sidewinders, and on the fourth, arrows again. The cloud of the
first day is black with Sky People, of the second, blue with Water
People, of the third, yellow with Sun People, and of the last, pink with
Summer People. The only apparent change is in the color; the design is
exactly the same for the four days. The second day the fire is not as
hot as on the first, the emesis not so violent, or nearly so long drawn
out. These events of the third day are again conscientiously done, but
even then not as strenuous as on the first.

On the second night the kitty quietly followed the guests into the
hogan. Curley's-Son saw it, went to the water bucket, filled a pan with
water and unobtrusively enticed it out past the door curtain. Dan and
Ben did not even see him do it. When he returned, the cat remained
outside.

By the end of the fourth day invitations have been offered to Wind,
Water-Monster, Water-Horse, Summer, Black Sky,

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Earth, Sun, Moon,
Pollen Boy, and Cornfly Girl, besides to the Horned-Rattlers; all beings
who assisted the first legendary heroes, the Holy Twins, to whose
sufferings we owe the Shooting Chant, and who for that reason will
assist us. When I came this year, I brought Red-Point a flask of water
from "the eastern ocean." He uses it for painting the prayersticks of
the second day. It has not been secured with the proper ceremony, but
perhaps it "will bring rain. We are trying it."

During the intervals between the ceremonial acts of each day the men are
working. To Marie and Ninaba they seem brief indeed, for they seize upon
these moments for naps. To me, though I am not weaving, the hours seem
like minutes. I am mulling over the myth of the Shooting Chant, finding,
in the narrative of the adventures of the two sons of the Sun,
explanations and understanding as well as the unity of all the
ostensibly unconnected small acts of each performance. But to the men
who are working, time has ceased to exist. They have a great deal to do,
and only a short time in which to do it.

Red-Point has determined to make this sing as complete as he possibly
can. So he has chosen an elaborate form of it called the
Chant-of-the-Sun's-House. He has sent out announcements of the event,
and each day a few of his friends have come; but the hands are few
compared with the work to be done. During the time he worked as a
missionary John did not participate actively in sings. If he went to one
he did so because "he had to see someone on business." But he comes to
ours on the second day, and because Red-Point is shorthanded, but more
because his hands itch, as do mine, to work with the attractive sticks
and paints, he begs to be allowed to help. The Chanter is pleased to let
him try.

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

All the men including John work tirelessly, although, as is the Navajo
custom, without haste. There are endless details to be attended to. A
chant of this sort requires an unlimited supply of water and wood, to
mention only two mundane needs. The largest task on hand is the
repainting of the Sun's-House which is the symbol of supernatural power
for the Chant. It is a booth not more than eighteen inches deep over the
front of which hangs a curtain of sticks like a portière. This is about
five feet wide by three high. Red-Point has not sung the
Chant-of-the-Sun's-House for eight years, and the curtain must be
painted anew. The pattern is exactly the same as the central part of the
Sun's-House sand-painting which Atlnaba so carefully wove into a
tapestry last year. Wide stripes of white, black, green, and yellow
occupy most of the space. With the yellow stripe as background four
deities, Sun, Moon, Black Wind, and Yellow Wind, form houses for the
four different kinds of snakes. Around each is a rainbow, blue
(Red-Point uses green) outside, red inside. Encircling three sides of
the whole is another rainbow of the same sort, no detail of which is
omitted.

Now if I were painting this curtain from Atlnaba's rug or Red-Point's
copy in water colors, it would not be so much work. I should paint a
stick all white and lay it horizontally for the top, two or three green
and lay them parallel with the first and so on. The last few which
compose the snakes' houses would be the only tedious ones. But the
Chanter and his assistants cannot do it this way. The sticks must hang
vertically. This means that every piece less than half an inch in
diameter must represent a cross-section of the whole. The designs must
be applied in mosaic fashion. As a weaver must carry in her mind her
entire pattern and at the same time

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

divide it into an infinite number of single-strand stripes, so must the
painters of the Sun's-House. Each "strand" of their painting is one
stick wide.

After two days of intermittent work at this John comes to my house just
before sundown to prefer a request. "You look tired," I say as I offer
him a smoke. "I am," he replies smiling. "It's lots of work."

"I never realized how much work a sing is," I say. "I simply cannot
understand how Red-Point does it. He superintends everything by day; he
never loses sight of a thing, and everything necessary is ready at the
proper moment. He hardly sleeps at night. Last night it was eleven
before the sing was over and this morning I heard him singing at
four-thirty."

"Yes," continues John. "I just came up for a little visit yesterday
morning. I did not intend to stay this long. But they need help, and I
offered to try my hand at the painting."

"Did you ever help before?"

"Never."

"It looks like a nice thing to do."

"It is," John replies. "The old man said I did better than some of the
others who had done it before."

A pause ensues, broken finally by John. "One of the boys has been
hunting his horse all day and has not found it. They need some medicine
for tomorrow night and now there is hardly time for him to get it even
if he could catch his horse."

"Where does he have to go for it?" I inquire.

"The nearest is Crystal."

"Why, that is sixty miles!" I exclaim.

"Yes. The old man is pretty disappointed because he

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

wanted this done so complete. I suggested that maybe you would be
willing to go for it. I said I would be glad to do it, but I do not know
how to cut the medicine properly nor do I know the prayers."

"I told him at the beginning that I should be glad to do anything of
that sort I could," I protest. "I knew he needed this distant medicine
fresh, but I didn't know when."

"The roads are dry and hard now. I think if we start about sunrise
tomorrow we could get it in time. He said one of the boys would go with
us. I said maybe you wouldn't mind getting up so early."

"All right," I agree, "but I think I better get gas tonight. I haven't
enough, and no trader will be up that early."

"I will take my horse home and come back with you. I am kind of worried
about my horses. I left them in the corral without any hay. And nobody
is home. I will let them out and look around the place."

I drive to Ganado, get gas and supplies, and visit my friends for
several hours. I am sorry to miss a part of the ceremony but am glad the
part I have to miss is not new, merely a repetition of what has gone
before. About nine I pick up John and we arrive at Red-Point's hogan as
the men are eating, preparatory to the evening sing. A discussion is
under way as Tom sits hatted and kerchiefed as if he were going
somewhere. Just before we arrived the man I call the
"Man-with-the-Voice-Wrapped-Up-in-Cotton-Batting" had inquired where he
was going. He answered, "To the southeast to get Douglas fir."

As we come in, someone suggests: "But it is just as far that way as to
Crystal. Both kinds grow at Crystal. Why don't you get it all on one
trip?"

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

John now takes command. "When do you have to have it?" "At noon
tomorrow."

John quietly and persuasively addresses himself to me. "Gladys, would
you mind starting tonight? We could throw your bed in the car and go as
far as we get, then camp, and in the morning cut our medicines. If we
have good luck we could be back by noon, when they need this Douglas
fir. The roads are good now, and there is no sign of rain."

"Sure, I can be ready in five minutes. I'll be down to eat before we
start. I will pick you up, and you can load the car on the way out."

So agreeing, I repair to my house to assemble my camp kit and strap my
blanket roll. I join John and Tom at the cooking shade in a few minutes,
and after a hearty meal we are off. Never has the road been better, and
I almost pray Jonathan will not do anything to delay us. He runs like a
charm, and we find ourselves near our destination a little after
midnight. In the darkness John and Tom have missed the dim tracks which
lead to the Pass where the trees we seek grow, and John suggests we camp
here until daylight. We do so, to find ourselves eaten up by mosquitoes.
John and Tom are so weary that even the millions of these pests do not
seriously annoy their slumbers. For once in my life I anticipate the
dawn; more eagerly than Red-Point I discern its first pale gleam. Out of
pity for the guides I linger a bit over my abbreviated ablutions and
fixing my bed for travelling. But these beasts are unendurable; besides
we have work to do, so I call the boys. I persist loudly before they
remember where they are and why. The mosquitoes soon bring back
consciousness.

In the cool of early dawn we drive a few miles to a road

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I had travelled
once before. It winds through green pastures watered by a clear,
fresh-running brook. As we ascend the steep slope of the mountain, the
meadows narrow, and the road is bordered on both sides by dense rows of
tall firs and spruces. There is no undergrowth, and the long luscious
grass is dotted here with a blue flower, there with a yellow, and
farther on with a bright dash of scarlet. We cross the stream and arrive
at our destination, a flat on the edge of a ravine. Gigantic pines grow
on the flat; we stop to camp near a Douglas fir which is at least eighty
feet high. As John lights a fire and collects with little effort the
fuel to enlarge it, I remember that upon the occasion of my previous
visit during which it had rained continuously, I had registered this as
one of my patterns for paradise.

The men are off to cut the branches of the Douglas fir and Colorado blue
spruce, both of which grow across the ravine. As I am making the coffee,
I decide to be decent enough to wait politely until the boys come back.
Within the short time it takes it to boil my decency evaporates. I do
not know how long they will be gone, I argue to myself. I take a cup of
coffee and a cinnamon roll, another cup and another roll. I am very
sleepy. There are no mosquitoes here, the morning is even too young for
flies. I have slept soundly for an hour and a half when the boys return
and we have a regular breakfast.

We start back with a large gunny sack of the fir branches. Tom had cut
several pieces of blue spruce very carefully so that each formed a cross
with two arms; to the butt end he had tied a knot of the blue cloth in
which he carries them. During the trip home he takes care always that
the spruce branches never leave the cloth; when we are moving the

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

bundle lies lightly on his lap, when we stop he lays it tenderly on the
seat.

"How did you cut the medicine?" I ask John as we drive along.

"Red-Point gave Tom a flint knife from his bundle and a little sack of
pollen. He told him the prayer to say as he cut a branch and sprinkled
it with pollen. You know Tom has been learning from Red-Point."

A few miles west of Fort Defiance we stop once more for some sticks of
wild rose, which complete the list of medicines for which we were sent.
Jonathan buzzes along in a determined and businesslike manner, and at
11:35 we enter the ceremonial hogan to the congratulations of the men
making the prayersticks there.

On the night which begins the fifth day the performance differs only
slightly from the previous four. The Sun's-House is finished and stands
at the back of the hogan, a protection and a blessing to it. The top and
sides of the booth are covered thickly with the green fir branches,
through the holes of the Sun, Moon and Wind houses wooden snakes move
back and forth. Above the curtain four carvings of clouds stick up. In
Atlnaba's weaving birds stood on these clouds. Here by invisible means a
bluebird, a bluejay, a blackbird, a wild canary, and a yellow warbler,
very realistic, fly about above the booth as they sing clearly and
sweetly. From now on this pantomime accompanies each performance. Often
Curley's-Son is strangely absent.

Old-Mexican's-Son sleeps in the hogan this night. The next morning as I
drive him home he reports, "You know there is something to that
Sun's-House. About three-thirty I got

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

awake and felt something like a presence. I told Red-Point, and he said,
"That's right, no one can sleep with the Sun's-House present." Very
early he woke up Marie and Ninaba and placed them in front of it. As the
pollen carried a prayer, the birds sang, and they sounded just like
bluebirds, too. Then Red-Point made them go outside and facing the
rising sun; they set up the things from his bundle which will guard the
house from evil while they are making the sand-painting of the day. As
he stuck each object in the sandpile, he chanted a long prayer. You know
there is something in these Navajo prayers that gets me. That's why I
like to go to sings."

"It was the prayer which woke me," I agree. "I couldn't hear the words
but it is the setting which is holy. The night the sheep were struck by
lightning I woke about midnight and heard Red-Point praying down near
the sheep corral. The parts of the sing the white people never see are
the most impressive. The lighting of the prayersticks and these prayers
in solitude carry the answer to the power of the chant. Even I who do
not believe can understand how these acts can really cure these people
because they believe so implicitly."

As we ride on in silence I muse, "It could not be otherwise when from
babyhood a Navajo has heard:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*"The curtain of daybreak is hanging.  
Daylight Boy, it is hanging.  
From the land of day it is hanging.  
Before him as it dawns, it is hanging.  
Behind him as it dawns, it is hanging.  
Before him in beauty, it is hanging.  
Behind him in beauty, it is hanging.  
From his voice in beauty, it is hanging.*

</div>

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

"In solitude:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Holy-Young-Man sought the gods and found then.  
On the high mountain peaks he sought the gods and found them.  
Truly with my sacrifice he sought the gods and found them.  
Somebody doubts it, so I have heard.

</div>

"*I* do not doubt it."
