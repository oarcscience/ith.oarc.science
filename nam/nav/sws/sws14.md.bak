### XI

#### RAIN

<span class="smallcaps">During</span> the first part of my stay the Sun,
"our father," has had his will. Each day unhindered he has pushed his
way through his own thin white curtain of dawn, passed serenely through
the broad blue curtain of daylight, relaxed at the curtain of yellow
evening light, and in a parting blaze of glory succumbed to the curtain
of darkness.

But at last the Water Sprinklers begin to contend with him. They card
cloud puffs of purest white wool. The Sun, joining the contest with
mirth, dyes their fluffs, for a time overcoming them, but they gain on
him continually. They start with small wisps which hang delicately here
and there on the horizon. Then they whisk their towcards harder, and the
white wisps rise higher in the sky. At last the Rain gods become drunk
with their own effects, and as they card they blow. They send black wind
after the white clouds, which chase one another madly across the sky.

I emerge from my hole to retrieve the flour sacks I have hung on my
piñon to dry, and to see that the knot of the sack containing the mutton
ribs Maria Antonia gave me is tight over its wire strung between the
branches. I compress my lips over my teeth as tightly as possible. I
make my eyes into the narrowest slits. Even so when I come back to the
hogan I am grinding sand between my teeth.

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

For some days Sun and Water gods play their comedy, the Water People
gradually gaining in strength. But we have had so many pseudo-storms we
stay inside and forget that the dark edges of the puffs are daily
becoming darker and may some day achieve their end.

At last the rainy season is on. I sit in my hogan weaving; the light
becomes dimmer; I hear a light patter on the sand roof. Diagonal streaks
of water shoot past my door. I rise to experience this wonder. But I
first throw my shed for the next row and insert the batten.

"Don't ever leave your stick in when you are not weaving," says Marie.
"If you do you will not finish your blanket."

She says it with an expression on her face which I interpret, "So they
say, but I don't believe it," but I pull out my batten and lay it on the
floor.

We stand before the opening of my house, we see this dry wetness, feel
it, breathe it. The first rain is a marvel, all rains are miraculous. We
breathe in the dust which rises under the splashing raindrops. It is no
longer gritty but earthy and refreshing.

"It is good, altogether good." We say it like a prayer of thankfulness
as we return to our work.

This day the Water Sprinkler is not playing with the Sun. He has called
on his friend Black Wind, and the two have decided to bless us. And now
quite suddenly there is another shower; but this one is heavy. No
thunder, no lightning, but rain and wind and more rain. This is the test
for our hogans. Rain blows in at the door and makes a puddle on the
floor. The puddle grows larger, trickles toward where we sit. We grab up
the wagon cover which serves as a carpet.

Rain comes in at the small ventilator in the center of the

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

roof, splashes on the floor, and spits sand on our blanket. We put the
wagon cover over the blanket and wool-box and each finds herself a place
to sit away from the puddles. The flock is on the way home, and Ruby
drives them as quickly as possible into the corral. The way lies over my
hogan. Slim pointed feet on soft sand make numerous perforations which
the water, seeking a channel, rejoices to follow. The roof is now like a
sieve. Marie puts a blanket around her shoulders, I don my raincoat and
hat. The books are in their trunk and papers in their briefcase; I lay a
tarpaulin over the trunk. Both Marie and I, by abbreviating ourselves as
much as possible, succeed in finding dry spots on which to sit. But we
are constantly changing our dry spots as they become fewer and fewer.

At last the rain slows up, and once more we emerge, looking like
drenched prairie dogs. The downpour was so ferocious that everyone
stayed exactly where he was. Now Tom, his blue shirt sticking to his
skin, comes up to inquire smilingly how the house is.

"Not so good," I reply. "The goats went over it after the sand got wet
and made lots of holes."

Tom untwists the balewire which fastens the shovel to the rear end of
the car and applies himself to the pile of sand which lies about the
house, the surplus dug out when it was made. He shovels it in great damp
chunks onto the roof, pounds and stamps it down, particularly over the
holes and around the ventilator. Then he digs a small trench inside the
door. The overflow stands in the trench, the little puddles have
disappeared, sunk into the sand of the floor.

Tom and Marie now go to their own house to inspect its soundness. I have
a headache and decide to go to Ganado as

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

soon as the water runs off a bit. The ground is wet; I should have to
sleep inside the hogan; I will spend the night with the traders. I put
on the chains, fasten the shovel, and, after a brief interval, announce
my intention and depart.

But this afternoon the sun acknowledges complete defeat. I have not gone
half a mile before it begins to rain again. I take the old road which is
over a hill and into a dip. I come to a low part of the road, which I
have previously hardly noticed. Now it looks like a lake. I stop at the
top of the slight incline. The rain pelts down. A wash runs angrily at
my side pouring its foaming yellow filth into the newly made lake. It is
cold and windy and wet. I know only one thing, that is to wait.

I wait for some minutes. Time has ceased. At last the rain lessens and I
test the crossing in the usual Southwest fashion. Take off shoes and
stockings and wade it. It is fearfully cold and before I have gone a rod
gets deep. I need go no farther. The water is halfway between my knees
and hips; it is too much for Jonathan. There is no going forward. The
ruts of the road are too deep and too slick for me to turn around in
even if the furious wash at my side did not terrify me. I wait longer.

After a while enough water has run off the landscape to allow the car
wheels once more to take hold. I back up for nearly a quarter of a mile.
At last I can turn out of the ruts and turn around on the nice rough
sagebrush.

I arrive back at Red-Point's settlement to find all the family blanketed
and wading outside the houses. The rain has ceased, but everything is
soaked. This was the test for the houses, and none of them passed it. It
rained in, it rained through, it rained under. My relatives are drenched
and busy

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

but smiling. Red-Point's house is the worst. The empty bucket and
washbasin are swimming about, hitting the loomframe now and again. The
few other objects which usually stand on the floor have been hastily
stowed in the crevices formed by the overlapping logs of the roof. The
blankets and sheepskins are hanging where all good housekeepers put them
each morning, over a pole supported by wires hung from the ceiling. The
top one inverted has streaks of red clay from the roof, the others are
dry.

Marie's house has leaked least, and it would be reasonable to suppose
that Maria Antonia and Red-Point could go there for the night.
Unthinkable! A respectable woman sleep in the same house as her
son-in-law! Sleep in a running stream rather! But Yikadezba's-Mother is
not home. Her house has not leaked at all and Red-Point moves in for the
night.

After I satisfy my curiosity as to all these arrangements I return to my
own house—return to find it completely dry. Tom's patching has made the
roof watertight, the door was closed and mine is the most comfortable of
all the dwellings.

I am cold. My wading, the wind, the wetting, all have combined to give
me a chill. I have no smokehole, but I have some dry wood; and I decide
to make a little fire even at the risk of considerable smoke. I am
coaxing it along, slowly but successfully, when Tom comes up with a
large armful of splintery newly split juniper. "I will make you a fire
under the tree," he announces, "so you can cook your supper. It's too
bad your house leaked."

"I'm not going to eat any supper because I have a headache," I answer;
"but I am cold, so I am building a fire in here. You needn't worry about
the house. You can see it is better than your own."

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

"The smoke will make your headache worse," he protests. "I don't think
it will smoke much now. But if it does I will put it out."

He goes, leaving me the dry wood.

I lay my bed as far from the door and ventilator as the space allows. I
have never slept inside before. The only drawback the house has,
noticeable chiefly in the quiet of the night, is the activity of a big
black beetle which burrows in the wall, allowing sand to run down the
sides. I hear it, snap on my flashlight, see nothing. I hear a tsuk!
tsuk! tsuk! above me, see nothing. This is the noise of a
wood-borer—"Wood-he-eats," the Navajo call him. He spends his time
boring holes in the ceiling logs and shedding rivulets of sawdust or
sand.

But with an aching head and back tired from weaving and driving Jonathan
in the slime, I do not long remain conscious of these busy insects,
which never come near me anyway, except rarely when they drop from the
ceiling.

The next thing I know, the sun, high in the sky, is casting streaks of
gold on my floor, filtering through cracks of my crazy door. I am warm
all over and rested. But I hear loud snicking sounds just outside. Those
wood-borers never before made that much noise. I get up and peep over
the door, trying to locate one at work. To my amazement there is a huge
crackling fire of juniper. Not a fire such as I make myself of scattered
sage and broken branches, but one gay, sputtering, flaming, of heavy
chopped cedar sticks. Do the Navajo have fairies, gnomes? They have
Toms.

We are prepared for rain now. Our houses are all patched, our goods well
stowed, no unused oddments lying about, our covers—tarps, ponchos,
sheepskins, blankets—within easy

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

reach. Once more I sit weaving, with Marie chattering amiably, somewhat
sleepily at my side.

"Do white women ever sleep in the daytime?" she asks. "Why—uh—uh! Why,
yes, sometimes we do when we are tired."

"The Navajo women never!" she remarks, suddenly lifting her head with a
look of surprise. "It's raining again." And that look of satisfaction
typical of the Navajo when they are pleased, settles on her face.

We continue our weaving placidly although the storm is gaining in
velocity. This is a male rain with wind, thunder, and lightning, sharp
lightning. I have learned to lay my door over the supports of the entry
when it rains. Quite satisfactory to keep the house dry, but it cuts off
most of our light. So we cover the weaving and just sit, as small as we
can make ourselves, and look at each other. Suddenly there comes a cry
from Maria Antonia's house, a startled cry of fear. The settlement is
galvanized into action. Marie darts up, I thrust the army blanket at
her. She rushes out while I put on my rain things.

I try to go out but the rain sends me back. There is no going between
drops, no walking between puddles. The settlement has become a single
puddle in which shoes slip and slide. I see my relatives running about
barefoot. The women have hastily thrown on their blankets, but their
ruffled skirts drip water. Tom and Curley's-Son have been shovelling to
divert the water from the houses, and they are soaked. No one has time
to watch Yikadezba even if he wants to, and she is enjoying a thorough
drenching.

Marie comes back to me in no time. "You must go to

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ganado and get the
old man," she says excitedly, "the sheep have been struck by lightning."

Tom comes in. "We must go at once," he says.

"Yes," I answer. "We will go, but we'll get there quicker if we wait
until it stops raining. You put the chains on for me and see that we
have the shovel, ax, and tow rope."

This is an almost superfluous remark for, even in the brightest weather,
Jonathan has a shovel, ax, and tow rope, just as he has headlights or
tires. But at this uncertain season the shovel may be resting against
the door of my house, the tow rope may have been used for our dyeing
activities. Better to check up for an emergency.

We huddle for twenty minutes in my hogan until the rain becomes lighter.
As we wait I ask about the sheep. "Were any killed?"

"We don't know. It looks as if three or four were maybe." "Where were
they?"

"Just off there." Tom and Marie point with pursed lips to a spot
directly in front of Maria Antonia's hogan, where many white dots are
still moving among the dark piñons.

"But why don't you know? Didn't you go over to see?"

"Ruby ran right back to tell us."

"Didn't you go out?"

Their answers are vague and indefinite. The fact remains that no one
went over to see. No one even drove the surviving sheep in. That is why
they must have Red-Point at once. Until he comes and, with a prayer,
releases the survivors from further harm, they are as afflicted as the
possible dead. This is one of the few occasions upon which I have seen
Navajo in a hurry. There is need for great speed. Jonathan will help.
But he will go faster if we wait a little.

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

Tom and I get started. We make the half-mile from our houses to the
highway easily, the road is of hard sand. The highway is new, it has
ditches on both sides for drainage. We slither along, now toward the
ditch at the right, now Jonathan prefers that at the left. But he wants
to go into some ditch. Tom is good with a shovel, but I try to save him
by guiding Jonathan and curbing his desire for leaving the road. We
proceed a mile and suddenly find the car holding the road. The tracks
are only damp and in a few more rods we are on a perfectly dry road.

Red-Point is at the dam. For weeks he has been bossing a gang of Navajo
with teams at repairing the ditches and flume. Today they are
reinforcing the spillway. We approach within a half-mile of the place
they are working and again run into deep mud. We leave the Ford in a
sizable puddle and proceed by foot.

Red-Point and his gang are a sorry-looking lot. Rain spills from their
four-gallon hats. Their coats are soggy, wrinkled, and shapeless. They
are barefoot, having hung shoes and moccasins under the wagons to keep
them dry. They have worked hard ever since the rainy season began,
repairing the spillway. A twenty-minute shower washed it out entirely.
But, as the water runs down over their faces like copious tears, to a
man they smile characteristically as they point to the results of their
work. They shrug their shoulders fatalistically as they say, "Hola!"

All are duly excited by our news. Red-Point has his horse, so cannot go
back with us. But he arrives at White-Sands very soon after we do. For
the rest of the evening all is quiet. The sons-in-law have gone off to
cut trees and branches to build a new corral. Red-Point goes out to the
sheep, taking with

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

him several little pouches of pollen and medicine from his large
medicine bundle. He goes to pray and to remove the dead sheep to the
cañon. The women wait.

When he returns, the women drive back the rest of the flock. They may
once more go near the sheep. The lightning striking into the flock as it
did, had contaminated all within its range. Red-Point had freed the
survivors from the immediate taint by his sung prayers, by sprinkling
pollen, and by removing the dead. The remainder of the flock must be
kept in a corral by themselves until he removes the permanent results of
the catastrophe. By the time the sheep return the boys have made the new
corral. They have left the branches on the trees and have laid them so
the flock can eat them during their eight-day incarceration. For four
days during which they will be treated for their ill luck, they must
remain, for four days more they stay in order that the medicine may take
effect.

Next day Marie tells me nine animals were lost, one of her own goats, a
lamb and sheep belonging to Maria Antonia, and six sheep of Atlnaba's.
This morning another of Atlnaba's lambs died. "They" have been sent for
sheep medicine. I have to this day never been able to find out exactly
who "they" are. When Red-Point wants herbs which must be gathered at a
distance, he sends "them," evidently messengers, probably relatives, he
is able to call upon at a moment's notice.

Red-Point, tired and coughing, comes in for a cigarette and visit. He
says: "Nine were lost. When I got there they were all swollen up. But if
I had got there sooner I could have sung and brought them back to life
again. It is too late when they are swollen up. It's too bad I wasn't
home."

I remark to Marie—my remark carries no weight—that

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

they had their singer in two hours after the sheep were struck. "The
Navajo don't usually get a singer that quickly, do they?"

"No," she agrees, but her faith and her father's have not been shaken by
a jot or a tittle.

We weave only for short periods today because Marie must go help
Red-Point or Atlnaba and I must go with her to see the short ceremonies
and all that they do. They do not mind my tagging along; they are only
surprised that I want to.

In the intervals when I am alone I continue my marvelling at my
grandfather and at his firm belief in himself. It is more than conceit,
it is over and above that. It is absolute faith in the efficacy of the
sing. He knows it perfectly. If then he performs it without a mistake,
why should it not be powerful, even sufficient to bring life to that
which is dead?

But I, with my un-Navajo type of mind, say to myself: "Ordinarily it
takes, with good luck even, half a day for a man to find his horse. He
then rides perhaps half a day or longer to the home of the singer he
wants to hire. If he is in luck the singer is home and it takes only
half a day to wrangle *his* horse and another half-day for the two to
ride back. Two days is then about the minimum time when a medicine man
may be expected. Two hours is about the greatest speed they might
achieve. And yet Red-Point is sure he could have brought the sheep to
life—if he had been here sooner...."

A dull day, a hot day, a still day. Even in the morning the sun does not
shine, nor does he ever peep between clouds causing them to part and
scuttle away. An ominous silence lies over us all. The air is heavy and
dead. The sounds of humans and animals are startling even in their
appropriateness.

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It has been
unusually hot and oppressive for a week, but today it seems as if
threat, of what I am not certain, must culminate in action. It is one of
those days when something dire seems about to happen, a time during
which one holds his breath and crosses his fingers. Life seems to be
running along smoothly. One thinks of the possible calamities on the
principle that it is the unexpected that happens. If then we expect
something awful, it at least won't be that something.

For some reason I am restless today and for some other reason I have no
visitors, not even Marie. My weaving does not hold me, and I tire
quickly of learning my Navajo language, a pursuit that usually interests
me for hours, more hours than there ever are. With a conscience guilty
at reading in the daytime I open a book. It is not interesting, nor are
the magazines I have. I must be tired; I will try to sleep, even if
Navajo women never do. But there is a fly on my nose—its buzzing sounds
like a saw in the tense silence. I will go outside. But there is no wind
and the flies are worse than they are inside. Besides, ants crawl
vigorously over tarpaulin and over me. I go back in. I think I am hungry
and eat some crackers. I repeat my list of entertainments. Those hours
which usually flit so fast I cannot see them, now drag interminably.

The silence is broken at last. I go out. This is no ordinary sandstorm.
As I watch the clouds I am the only living thing between the fury of the
sky and the earth it rages over. From the southwest thick clouds, black
as night but not in a solid curtain, roll up, gather fierceness, and in
anger pass madly over White-Sands. They contain, I see easily, every
possibility for destruction. They pass over us so swiftly that they are
not able to drop on us any of their contents. They race madly to

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

the northeast. There they meet all their own kind and others too; all
unite to become the embodiment of cataclysm. Black puffy wind clouds,
smooth black thunderclouds, gray rain clouds, yellow, hail-bearing
masses. They knot up in the northeast, snarl and snap and finally,
releasing their accumulated frenzy, vent it on the earth. Wind, male
rain, thunder, lightning, hail.

I, from my roof-top, view it all, seeing only the general calamity,
unaware of details. As suddenly as the storm gathered, earth and sky
relax about me. The air is cool and fresh; sounds take on their usual
matter-of-factness; the earth is sweetly fragrant. A smooth black cloud
lies long and horizontally an arm's length above the western horizon. At
last the sun triumphs; he breaks forth under the cloud in a red-gold
glow, grinning so broadly the eye cannot bear him. But the presence of
the cloud has let him turn our little world, which seems to me immense,
to copper.

I am the only reality. The herdboy, whom I have always heartily
disliked, has turned into a statue of living bronze. The thought passes
fleetingly through my mind, "Why, Paul is really exceedingly handsome!"
The sheep grazing near by are fluffy fulvid beings, no longer stupid and
impolite, but something existing only in the imagination of a
super-being.

A moment of superb insubstantiality, and we are back to the
comprehensible, a well-run, prosperous Navajo family driving sheep into
corrals, cedar fire crackling in the fireplace, mutton boiling, children
teasing, dogs barking.

Next day we learn the results of the tornado and take a trip to survey
the havoc. It has raised the water level of the large reservoir near
Ganado, empty all summer, five feet. But

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

it has ripped out entirely the diversion dam which controlled the
ditches. The place where it stood used to look like a smooth lake. It
has now become a wide forty-foot cañon. Concrete piers are torn
completely away, their mass dumped in the side of the wash at intervals
half a mile down. The traders tell me the waves rose as high as the
telephone poles in front of their place. In the sixty years of their
experience they remember nothing like this. Poor old blind Tonto, the
twelve-year-old son who led him through life, and his little grandson
were drowned just outside their hogan. No one knows how many sheep were
lost.

We continue our pilgrimage in the bright mellow sunshine. We drive
toward the storm belt, come to a halt nine miles southeast of Ganado
where the chief sights are to be seen. Cutting an eight-mile swath the
storm has denuded every tree of branches, leaves, and cones. This is a
year for piñon nuts. Within this belt every tree has become a spiked
trunk.

At the right of the road is a pile of hailstones, packed as if in an
icehouse five feet high. I had never believed the tales of "hailstones
big as hen's eggs," but these were larger than walnuts five days after
the storm. The wall they made melted gradually for three weeks
afterward.

We walk a short distance to our left. There we see how the wash brought
down stone slabs twenty-eight feet long, uprooted trees three feet in
diameter. The débris brought down forms a natural dam so that the wash
which formerly ran west by north has now been turned and runs nearly
directly south. As we gaze on it and contemplate what we saw at the
diversion dam, we realize in a feeble way how the Grand Canyon could
have been possible. These last days have shown me

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

wonders my senses almost repudiate. They are uncanny but as actual as
this lacerated earth itself.

My friends add their observations of nature's freakishness to mine.
After the world turned to bronze the moon came up. But some rain
lingered between it and the clear western sky. The moon reflected its
quiet rays through the light rain streamers of the night, causing a
white rainbow. It happened to fit perfectly over a well defined little
hill, and the effect was of a great empty white stadium.

A few days later in the course of our conversation Red-Point remarks
casually: "It's awful dry. We need rain."
