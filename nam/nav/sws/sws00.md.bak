# Spider Woman

### *A Story of Navajo Weavers and Chanters*

#### Gladys A. Reichard

*"Spider Woman instructed the Navajo women how to weave on a loom which
Spider Man told them how to make. The crosspoles were made of sky and
earth cords, the warp sticks of sun rays, the healds of rock crystal and
sheet lightning. The batten was a sun halo, white shell made the comb.
There were four spindles; one a stick of zigzag lightning with a whorl
of cannel coal; one a stick of flash lightning with a whorl of
turquoise; a third had a stick of sheet lightning with a whorl of
abalone; a rain streamer formed the stick of the fourth, and its whorl
was [white](errata.htm#0) shell." (Navajo Legend.md)*
