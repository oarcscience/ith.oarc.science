### XXI

#### THE GODS INVITED

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> house has been blessed, the inmates
have suffered together to purify themselves. Already the materials for
the sacrifices have been considered and are in readiness. All is
prepared for the gods. A little after one Tom calls me. I enter the
house to behold a pleasant scene. Red-Point reclines on his pile of
sheepskins, physically relaxed, nevertheless keeping a watchful eye on
the work of Tom and Curley's-Son. At a point south by west of the hogan
they sit on a blanket on which is spread a multitude of dainty and
fascinating objects: accurately cut, even pieces of reed, smooth flat
stones which serve as palettes for the small quantities of white, blue,
black, red, and yellow natural pigments, brushes of yucca fiber, bunches
of fluffy gay-colored feathers, a pile of varicolored stones, each one
almost microscopic, a cup of water, a penknife, a piece of rock crystal.

Under Red-Point's directions his sons-in-law have cut from the reed the
prayersticks which, after the proper treatment, will convey to the
Snakes our desire to have them present during the following days. They
helped to bring on Marie's ailment, they have power to cure it. There
are two double prayer-sticks, each about six inches long, eight small
ones, only about three inches long. They have been cut so there is a
node in the middle making two compartments. Tom and his

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

brother handle these objects delicately as they sketch with the tiny
brushes the same designs which were used for the morning's
sand-paintings near the fire, a black snake with white border, a white
snake with black border, a blue snake with yellow border, a yellow snake
with blue border. Tom is more skilful at this kind of work than his
brother. Neither of them needs to remember the patterns or position of
the figures; Red-Point tells them before they begin. If they make
mistakes they must correct them. If they leave them, the super-naturals
will punish Red-Point, for he is responsible. He becomes impatient only
if the helpers are stupid or inefficient.

Occasionally as they work Red-Point sits up, grasps his rattle, and
sings a short song. As he waits and rests, he hums a tune, allowing no
false move to elude him. Tom finishes painting and, as Curley's-Son
continues, places pieces of cotton cloth, yellow with age, in a row on
the blanket. Then from the open sack of precious stones he chooses one
of each kind beloved by the gods, turquoise, whiteshell, redstone,
abalone, and lays one on each cloth. Along with each in punctilious
order he places one wing feather and one tail feather of a wild canary,
three feathers from the bluebird's tail, one feather of eagle down, one
of turkey down, a hair from a turkey's beard, and a bit of cotton thread
ceremonially spun and torn.

Curley's-Son is still painting. Red-Point sets out an open sack of
yellow pollen. Tom makes little balls of bluebird feathers, which he
sprinkles with the yellow pollen. By this time his brother has finished
painting the reeds. Tom lays them on the cloths according to Red-Point's
instructions while Curley's-Son removes the surplus paints, pieces of
reed and all implements they had been using. Tom puts the bits of

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

precious stone into one end of each decorated reed and inserts the blue
feather ball as a stopper, taking care to lay the reed back on its cloth
in the stipulated position. Curley's-Son, after depositing the unused
materials outside at the places ordained, calls Marie and Ninaba.

My heart goes out to Marie. The excitement, the fasting, the emetic,
have combined to make the headache she has from a severe cold almost
unbearable. I can see she can hardly sit up. I know from experience she
would feel as badly if she lay down. The only boon she could ask would
be to be left undisturbed; this will under no circumstances be granted
her, either today or at any time for the next eight days. She and Ninaba
take their places near the prayersticks. Red-Point takes from his bundle
a small case of yellow bone, smooth with age. From its hollow he pulls a
tiny brush which he hands to Marie. She dips it in water, then in the
yellow pollen and runs it lightly (really only symbolically) over each
prayerstick and the articles accompanying it. Ninaba, as usual, imitates
everything she does.

When Red-Point has placed the tiny brush in the little bone case, and it
in its diminutive sack and laid it away, Tom hands Marie the crystal.
Then he holds one of the offerings before her. She lifts the crystal to
the smokehole of the house, where it symbolically catches the sunlight,
and with it "lights" the prayerstick. Ninaba does the same. Tom dips a
finger lightly into the cup of water and conveys a drop to the opening
of the prayerstick, which he then seals by placing pollen on it. After
all are sealed the encircling cloths are folded; then Red-Point piles
the prayer-bundles in regular order and gives one pile into Marie's, the
other into Ninaba's hand. Curley's-Son

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

stands ready with an old blanket which is in constant use in this chant.

Red-Point takes his place facing Marie and Ninaba and leads the prayer
which they repeat like a litany. The prayer is long, it must be spoken
without error, no word may be left out, none should be repeated. In
order to concentrate, Red-Point closes his eyes, Marie and Ninaba cast
theirs down. Marie does not know the prayer but she repeats it
accurately. Ninaba falls behind, catches her breath. As Red-Point
hastens on with it she loses some phrases here and there. A stillness
and solemnity encompass the hogan, the moment is altogether sacred.

Black pollen with which he conceals his body,

From below the plants, from the trees under which water flows.

With these may it be beautiful before me.*

At the end of the prayer, which includes many repetitions of the
stanzas, Curley's-Son takes the sacrifices out and deposits them where
the black-, white-, blue-, and yellow-horned rattler chiefs and maidens
must see them. Since we made and planted them properly, the
Horned-Rattlers cannot refuse our invitation. They will be present at
our sing.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[167:1](sws24.htm#fr_0) "Beauty, beautiful" are
only my choice of the English words, all unsatisfactory, which might be
used in rendering the Navajo word which means "beauty, goodness,
success, comfort, good luck, desirability, good will, blessing, good
health, happiness," in fact, all qualities and virtues which man desires
and cultivates.
