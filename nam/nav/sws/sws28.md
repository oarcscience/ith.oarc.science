### XXV

#### EFFECTS

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> songs are over. The singing and
drumming continue with only a few short intermissions all night. The
Chanter, chorus, and patients may not even doze off, but the rest of us
take a cat nap now and then. And now after breakfast, when all is still
and peaceful, Marie and Ninaba come to see me. They rub their sleepy
eyes, as Marie tells me: "We may not sleep as long as the sun is up. For
the next four days we must get up at sunrise, and we must not sleep
again until after sunset. That is because we had the Sun's-House. So
when I was nearly falling off, my father said, "Go up and see
Weaving-Woman, and tell her to keep you awake."

"I'll do that all right," I laugh. "I shall take no pity on you when you
are getting tired of my questions, but I'll just keep on"—referring to
our work in language. Marie may not work; but teaching me Navajo is not
work, and I shall nag at her with my eternal curiosity.

If the patients sleep in the daytime they may have bad dreams, and that
would keep the pollen ball from remaining in place.

They still wear the large bunch of feathers and the small beads on their
hair. They have rubbed, perhaps not purposely, a great deal of the paint
off their faces. But they may not wash or comb their hair for four days,
nor may they remove

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

clothes or moccasins. The necklaces and wristbands of yucca and fir are
still pricking into their flesh, a minor torture. They do not stay long
this time, for Red-Point once more calls them. He unties the feather
bundle from each head and from it takes a down feather which he bids
them carry. Then all three walk about a quarter of a mile to the west,
where Red-Point selects a small piñon tree before which they stand. He
ties the down feathers to the tip of the tree, after sprinkling pollen
at the four quarters, around, up and down. Then he removes the yucca
necklaces and secures them over the upper central branches of the tree.
The wristbands he places on branches at each side. As they stand there
side by side, he speaks the prayer of the young pine four times, and his
daughters repeat it after him:

*Dark young pine, at the center of the earth originating,  
I have made your sacrifice.  
Whiteshell, turquoise, abalone beautiful,  
Jet beautiful, fool's gold beautiful, blue pollen beautiful, reed
pollen, pollen beautiful, your sacrifice I have made.  
This day your child I have become, I say.*

*Watch over me.  
Hold your hand before me in protection.  
Stand guard for me, speak in defense of me.  
As I speak for you, so do ye.  
As you speak for me, thus shall I do.  
     May it be beautiful before me,  
     May it be beautiful behind me,  
     May it be beautiful below me,*

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

*     May it be beautiful above me,  
     May it be beautiful all around me.*

*     I am restored in beauty,  
     I am restored in beauty,  
     I am restored in beauty,  
     I am restored in beauty.*

After all sprinkle pollen once more they return home.

On subsequent visits of Marie, I learn that the kind of work they may
not do has to do with fire and water. They must not go near fire or use
water, although they may drink some. They have had the sacred patterns
put on their bodies with care and song, and for that reason will be
benefited. But they must not touch anyone who has never had the sing,
nor should such ones touch their things. Only those who have had the
sing may eat with them and wash the dishes they use, for the blessings
of the chant are permanent. What is done now is done for all time. For
four days they will observe these restrictions; for four nights more
they will sleep in the hogan under Red-Point's eye. To those who have
not had the sing, they might communicate power in an irregular and
disorderly manner, that would bring special harm to the person
encountered.

"Harriet said when her mother had the sing, she washed after two days,"
I tell Marie, speaking of a girl who had visited us.

Marie's scorn knows no bounds. "Yes, and she was bitten by a snake that
very summer. That's what is the matter with Totlani's-Wife, too. She had
this sing over at Water-in-the-Earth,

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

and she started to cook the very day after the all-night sing. My father
says that is the reason she is so sick."

Totlani's-Wife is dying of cancer. Some say it is because she wove too
many sand-painting blankets, since before her illness she was
industrious and enterprising. Red-Point is sure he could cure her, for
although she has already had the Shooting Chant sung for her, he is sure
it was not done properly.

"She is worse, did you know?" I tell Marie. "She got a cold much like
you had, only worse, and she was spitting blood. They had a man to tell
what sing she ought to have when I was there day before yesterday. He
said she ought to have the Female Shooting Chant and after that the War
Dance."

"It's too bad," says Marie. "You know after the first day when I had
that awful headache, my father said my hands were cooler. It was the
sing that made it. After that I didn't have headache any more either."

"It seems as though your father never makes a mistake. I know, of
course, that he has to say the prayers just exactly right. You said them
all right, too, but what does he do when someone can't keep up? If I had
a sing, I am sure I'd make mistakes. Would he be able to sing so that it
would not matter?"

"Yes, that's the way they do. Ninaba got off the track, too, but he can
make that all right with a prayer. We don't know what to do either. They
have to tell us."

Dan rides up as we talk. The men are going to brand cattle. Do we want
to watch them? In no time we have a full auto. Yikadezba and Djiba as
usual implore us to take them. "They can come this time," I say. "Ninaba
can hold Djiba."

"No, we are not allowed to touch the children. They have

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

never had the sing." The women negotiate. They agree that the children
will walk to the branding with Atlnaba.

On the way Marie communicates another bit of gossip. "Mary said she was
going to come up to the sing, but she couldn't get anyone to bring her.
She was coming to make fun. She said she wouldn't have a sing with those
dirty old medicine-men."

"I think a person doesn't have to believe it," I reply, "but I don't
think she needs to make fun of it."

"She's a Christian!" bursts forth Marie indignantly. "That's the reason
she has such funny babies!"

Mary has had one child born without eyes and another without a skull.
Both lived for some time, a horror to Indians and whites alike. The
doctor says she has chronic malconception; the Navajo say it is
irreverence.

The branding is a pleasant diversion.

Another full day goes by when a party of the family, Marie and Ninaba
included, go by wagon to a cañon toward the east where they carefully
deposit Butte-Reaching-to-the-Sky. This is a sculptured part of the
double painting made of pottery clay. Red-Point goes with them and the
disposal is made ritualistically.

Before we know it, the four days are gone. At sunrise after the
thirteenth night from the beginning of the chant, Marie and Ninaba untie
the beads from their hair, shampoo it and wash their entire bodies in
yucca suds. Each ties her bead to her hair string and from this time on
will wear it always. If ever there is a storm, an epidemic, or she "gets
into a tight place," she may shake the bead at the offender as she
utters a prayer, and all danger will disappear.
