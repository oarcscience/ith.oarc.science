# THE DÎNÉ: ORIGIN MYTHS OF THE NAVAHO INDIANS

### By AILEEN O'BRYAN

# THE CREATION OR AGE OF BEGINNING

## THE FIRST WORLD

These stories were told to Sandoval, Hastin Tlo'tsi hee, by his
grandmother, Esdzan Hosh kige. Her ancestor was Esdzan at a', the
medicine woman who had the Calendar Stone in her keeping. Here are the
stories of the Four Worlds that had no sun, and of the Fifth, the world
we live in, which some call the Changeable World.

The First World, Ni'hodilqil,\[1\] was black as black wool. It had four
corners, and over these appeared four clouds. These four clouds
contained within themselves the elements of the First World. They were
in color, black, white, blue, and yellow.

The Black Cloud represented the Female Being or Substance. For as a
child sleeps when being nursed, so life slept in the darkness of the
Female Being. The White Cloud represented the Male Being or Substance.
He was the Dawn, the Light-Which-Awakens, of the First World.

In the East, at the place where the Black Cloud and the White Cloud met,
First Man, Atse'hastqin\[2\] was formed; and with him was formed the
white corn, perfect in shape, with kernels covering the whole ear.
Dolionot i'ni is the name of this first seed corn,\[3\] and it is also
the name of the place where the Black Cloud and the White Cloud met.

\[1. Informant's note: Five names were given to this First World in Its
relation to First man. It was called Dark Earth, Ni'hodilqil; Red Earth,
Ni'halchi; One Speech, Sada hat lai; Floating Land, Ni'ta na elth; and
One Tree, De east'da eith.

Matthews (1897, p. 65): The First World was red. Franciscan Fathers
(1912, p. 140): ni' the world or earth; ni' hodilqil, the dark or lowest
of the underworlds; (p. 111) lai, one, or first. Franciscan Fathers
(1910, p. 81): sad, a word, a language; Sad lai, First Speech.

2\. Franciscan Fathers (1912, p. 93): Atse'hastqin, First Man.

3\. Informant's note: Where much corn is raised one or two ears are
found perfect. These are always kept for seed corn.

Franciscan Fathers (1912, p. 85): do honot'i ni, the name of a full ear,
or seed corn.\]

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

The First World was small in size, a floating island in mist or water.
On it there grew one tree, a pine tree, which was later brought to the
present world for firewood.

Man was not, however, in his present form. The conception was of a male
and a female being who were to become man and woman. The creatures of
the First World are thought of as the Mist People; they had no definite
form, but were to change to men, beasts, birds, and reptiles of this
world.\[4\]

Now on the western side of the First World, in a place that later was to
become the Land of Sunset, there appeared the Blue Cloud, and opposite
it there appeared the Yellow Cloud. Where they came together First Woman
was formed, and with her the yellow corn. This ear of corn was also
perfect. With First Woman there came the white shell and the turquoise
and the yucca.\[5\]

First Man stood on the eastern side of the First World. He represented
the Dawn and was the Life Giver. First Woman stood opposite in the West.
She represented Darkness and Death.

First Man burned a crystal for a fire. The crystal belonged to the male
and was the symbol of the mind and of clear seeing. When First Man
burned it, it was the mind's awakening. First Woman burned her turquoise
for a fire. They saw each other's lights in the distance. When the Black
Cloud and the White Cloud rose higher in the sky First Map. set out to
find the turquoise light. He went twice without success, and again a
third time; then he broke a forked branch from his tree, and, looking
through the fork, he marked the place where the light burned. And the
fourth time he walked to it and found smoke coming from a home.

"Here is the home I could not find," First Man said.

First Woman answered: "Oh, it is you. I saw you walking around and I
wondered why you did not come."

Again the same thing happened when the Blue Cloud and the Yellow Cloud
rose higher in the sky. First Woman saw a light and she went out to find
it. Three times she was unsuccessful, but the fourth time she saw the
smoke and she found the home of First Man.

"I wondered what this thing could be," she said.

"I saw you walking and I wondered why you did not come to me," First Man
answered.

\[4. Informant's note: The Navaho people have always believed In
evolution.

5\. Informant's note: Five names were given also to the First World in
Its relation to First Woman: White Bead Standing, Yolgai'na ziha;
Turquoise Standing, Dolt i'zhi na ziha; White Bead Floating Place,
Yolgai'dana elth gal; Turquoise Floating Place, Dolt i'zhi na elth gai;
and Yucca Standing, Tasas y ah gal. Yucca represents cleanliness and
things ceremonial.

Franciscan Fathers (1912, p. 181): Tsa'zi ntqe'li, *Yucca baccata*, wide
leaf yucca or Spanish bayonet. The roots of this species furnish a rich
lather; the plant is frequently referred to as tqalawhush, soap.\]

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

First Woman saw that First Man had a crystal for a fire, and she saw
that it was stronger than her turquoise fire. And as she was thinking,
First Man spoke to her. "Why do you not come with your fire and we will
live together." The woman agreed to this. So instead of the man going to
the woman, as is the custom now, the woman went to the man.

About this time there came another person, the
Great-Coyote-Who-Was-Formed-in-the-Water,\[6\] and he was in the form of
a male being. He told the two that he had been hatched from an egg. He
knew all that was under the water and all that was in the skies. First
Man placed this person ahead of himself in all things. The three began
to plan what was to come to pass; and while they were thus occupied
another being came to them. He also had the form of a man, but he wore a
hairy coat, lined with white fur, that fell to his knees and was belted
in at the waist. His name was Atse'hashke', First Angry or Coyote.\[7\]
He said to the three: "You believe that you were the first persons. You
are mistaken. I was living when you were formed."

Then four beings came together. They were yellow in color and were
called the tsts'na. or wasp people. They knew the secret of shooting
evil and could harm others. They were very powerful.

This made eight people.

Four more beings came. They were small in size and wore red shirts and
had little black eyes. They were the naazo'zi or spider ants. They knew
how to sting, and were a great people.

After these came a whole crowd of beings. Dark colored they were, with
thick lips and dark, protruding eyes. They were the wolazhi'ni, the
black ants. They also knew the secret of shooting evil and were
powerful; but they killed each other steadily.

By this time there were many people. Then came a multitude of little
creatures. They were peaceful and harmless, but the odor from them was
unpleasant. They were called the wolazhi'ni nlchu nigi, meaning that
which emits an odor.\[8\]

And after the wasps and the different ant people there came the beetles,
dragonflies, bat people, the Spider Man and Woman, and the Salt Man and
Woman,\[9\] and others that rightfully had no definite

\[6. Informant's note: The Great Coyote who was formed in the water, Mat
tqo y elth chili. Franciscan Fathers (1912, p. 117): ma'ists, wolf (big
roamer); and ma'ists o'si, Coyote (slender roamer).

7\. Informant's note: Some medicine men claim that witchcraft came with
First Man and First Woman, others Insist that devil conception or
witchcraft originated with the Coyote called First Angry.

Franciscan Fathers (1912, pp. 140, 175, 351).

8\. Informant's note: No English name given this insect. Ants cause
trouble, as also do wasps and other insects, If their homes are harmed.

Franciscan Fathers (1910 p. 346): Much evil, disease and bodily Injury
is due also to secret agents of evil, In consequence of which the belief
. . . . shooting of evil (sting) is widely spread.

9\. Informant's note: Beetle, ntisa'go; Dragonfly, tqanil at'; Bat
people, ja aba'ni: Spider Man, nashjei hastqin; Spider Woman, nashjei
esdza; Salt Man, ashi hastqin; Salt Woman, ashi esdza.\]

form but were among those people who peopled the First World.\[10\] And
this world, being small in size, became crowded, and the people
quarreled and fought among themselves, and in all ways made living very
unhappy.

## THE SECOND WORLD

Because of the strife in the First World, First Man, First Woman, the
Great-Coyote-Who-Was-Formed-in-the-Water, and the Coyote called First
Angry, followed by all the others, climbed up from the World of Darkness
and Dampness to the Second or Blue World.\[11\]

They found a number of people already living there: blue birds, blue
hawks, blue jays, blue herons, and all the blue-feathered beings.\[12\]
The powerful swallow people\[13\] lived there also, and these people
made the Second World\[14\] unpleasant for those who had come from the
First World. There was fighting and killing.

The First Four found an opening in the World of Blue Haze; and they
climbed through this and led the people up into the Third or Yellow
world.

## THE THIRD WORLD

The bluebird was the first to reach the Third or Yellow World. After him
came the First Four and all the others.

A great river crossed this land from north to south. It was the Female
River. There was another river crossing it from east to West, it was the
Male River. This Male River flowed through the Female River and
on;\[15\] and the name of this place is tqo alna'osdli, the Crossing of
the waters.\[16\]

There were six mountains in the Third World.\[17\] In the East was Sis
na' jin, the Standing Black Sash. Its ceremonial name is Yol

17\. Informant's note: Sis na' jin, Mount Baldy near Alamos, Colo.;
Tso'dzil, Mount Taylor, N. Mex.; Dook'oslid, San Francisco Mountain,
Ariz.; Debe'ntsa, San Juan Mountains, Colo.; Dzil na'odili, El Huerfano
Peak, N. Mex.; and Choli, also given as El Huerfano or El Huerfanito
Peak, N. Mex. These mountains of the Third World were not in their true
form, but rather the substance of the mountains.

mountains named by the First Man: Tsisnadzi'ne, East; Tso'tsil, South;
Do koslid, West; Debe'ntsa, North. Also, note 51, pp. 220-221, version A
and version B; notes 52, 53, 54, 56, p. 221; and notes 58, 60, 62, 65,

Amsden (1934, p. 123).

Recorders note: Although both Matthews and the Franciscan Fathers give
Sisnajin as Pelado Peak, Sam Ahkeah, the Interpreter, after checking,
Identified it as Mount Baldy near Alamosa, Colo. Also, although the
Franciscan Fathers give Dzil na odili choli as Huerfanito Peak, Sam
Ahkeah says that it is the Mother Mountain near Taos.\]

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

gai'dzil, the Dawn or White Shell Mountain. In the South stood Tso'dzil,
the Great Mountain, also called Mountain Tongue. Its ceremonial name is
Yodolt i'zhi dzil, the Blue Bead or Turquoise Mountain. In the West
stood Dook'oslid, and the meaning of this name is forgotten. Its
ceremonial name is Dichi'li dzil, the Abalone Shell Mountain. In the
North stood Debe'ntsa, Many Sheep Mountain. Its ceremonial name is
Bash'zhini dzil, Obsidian Mountain. Then there was Dzil na'odili, the
Upper Mountain. It was very sacred; and its name means also the Center
Place, and the people moved around it. Its ceremonial name is Ntl'is
dzil, Precious Stone or Banded Rock Mountain. There was still another
mountain called Chol'i'i or Dzil na'odili choli, and it was also a
sacred mountain.

There was no sun in this land, only the two rivers and the six
mountains. And these rivers and mountains were not in their present
form, but rather the substance of mountains and rivers as were First
Man, First Woman, and the others.

Now beyond Sis na' jin, in the east, there lived the Turquoise
Hermaphrodite, Ashton nutli.\[18\] He was also known as the Turquoise
Boy. And near this person grew the male reed. Beyond, still farther in
the east, there lived a people called the Hadahuneya'nigi,\[19\] the
Mirage or Agate People. Still farther in the east there lived twelve
beings called the Naaskiddi.\[20\] And beyond the home of these beings
there lived four others--the Holy Man, the Holy Woman, the Holy Boy, and
the Holy Girl.

In the West there lived the White Shell Hermaphrodite\[21\] or Girl, and
with her was the big female reed which grew at the water's edge. It had
no tassel. Beyond her in the West there lived another stone people
called the Hadahunes'tqin, the Ground Heat People. Still

\[28. Informant's note: Ashon nutli', the Turquoise Hermaphrodite, later
became masculine and was known as the Sun Bearer, Jo hona'ai.

29\. Informant's note: The Hadahuneya'nigi are the Stone people who live
where there is a mirage on the desert.

Interpreter's note: These Stone People came from the East.

Morris (1921), p. 115): p. 127, this bulletin; Stevenson (1891, p. 275).
Matthews (1897, p. 63): To the East there was a place called Tau (corn),
to the South, a place called Nahodoo'la, and to the West a place called
Lokatsos akad (Standing Reed). Again to the East there was a place
called Essal'ai (One Pot), to the South a place called To'hadzitil (They
came often for water), and to the West a place called Dsilitsibe hogan
(House made of Red Mountain). Then again to the East there was a place
called Ley a hogan (Underground house), and to the South a place called
Tsil st'ntha (Among aromatic sumac), and to the West a place called
Tse'lits ibe hogan (House made of red rock).

20\. Informant's note: The Naaskiddi or Gha'askidi are the hunchback
figures connected with seeds, fertility, and phallus worship. They are
said to have come from the mountain called Chol'i'i.

21\. Informant's note: The White Shell Hermaphrodite or Girl later
entered the Moon and became the Moon Bearer. She is connected with
Esdzanadle, the Woman-Who Changes, or Yolgai esdzan, the White Shell
Woman.\]

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

farther on there lived another twelve beings, but these were all
females.\[22\] And again, in the Far West, there lived four Holy Ones.

Within this land there lived the Kisa'ni, the ancients of the Pueblo
People. On the six mountains there lived the Cave Dwellers or Great
Swallow People.\[23\] On the mountains lived also the light and dark
squirrels, chipmunks, mice, rats, the turkey people, the deer and cat
people, the spider people, and the lizards and snakes. The beaver people
lived along the rivers, and the frogs and turtles and all the underwater
people in the water. So far all the people were similar. They had no
definite form, but they had been given different names because of
different characteristics.

Now the plan was to plant.

First Man called the people together. He brought forth the white corn
which had been formed with him. First Woman brought the yellow corn.
They laid the perfect ears side by side; then they asked one person from
among the many to come and help them. The Turkey stepped forward. They
asked him where he had come from, and he said that he had come from the
Gray Mountain.\[24\] He danced back and forth four times, then he shook
his feather coat and there dropped from his clothing four kernels of
corn, one gray, one blue, one black, and one red. Another person was
asked to help in the plan of the planting. The Big Snake came forward.
He likewise brought forth four seeds, the pumpkin, the watermelon, the
cantaloup, and the muskmelon. His plants all crawl on the ground.

They planted the seeds, and their harvest was great.

After the harvest the Turquoise Boy from the East came and visited First
Woman. When First Man returned to his home he found his wife with this
boy. First Woman told her husband that Ashon nutli' was of her flesh and
not of his flesh.\[25\] She said that she had used her own fire, the
turquoise, and had ground her own yellow corn into meal. This corn she
had planted and cared for herself.

Now at that time there were four chiefs: Big Snake, Mountain Lion,
Otter, and Bear.\[26\] And it was the custom when the black cloud rose

\[22 Informant's note: The Corn Maidens are deities of fertility.

23\. Informant's note: The Great Swallow People, Tqashji'zhi ndilk'si,
lived in rough houses of mud and sticks. They entered them from holes in
the roof.

24\. Informant's note: The Gray Mountain is the home of the Gray Yei,
Hasch ei'ba'i, whose other name is Water Sprinkler. The turkey is
connected with water and rain.

Interpreter's note: Gray Mountain is San Francisco Mountain, Ariz.
Tqo'neinili, the Water Sprinkler, whose color is gray, lives there. He
is also called the Gray God, Hasch e'lbai, and the Clown whose call is
"do do," and whose name is Hasch e'dodi.

25\. Informant's note: First Woman and the Turquoise Hermaphrodite
represented the female principle. Later he said: There is confusion
among medicine men regarding this. Some say that the Turquoise Boy was
Ashon nutli'; some say the Mirage Man, some contend that "It" was
another "Turquoise Boy."

26\. Informant's note: Some medicine men call them the chiefs of the
Four Directions.\]

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

in the morning\[27\] for First Man to come out of his dwelling and speak
to the people. After First Man had spoken the four chief s told them
what they should do that day. They also spoke of the past and of the
future. But after First Man found his wife with another he would not
come out to speak to the people. The black cloud rose higher, but First
Man would not leave his dwelling; neither would he eat or drink. No one
spoke to the people for 4 days. All during this time First Man remained
silent, and would not touch food or water. Four times the white cloud
rose. Then the four chiefs went to First Man and demanded to know why he
would not speak to the people. The chiefs asked this question three
times, and a fourth, before First Man would answer them.

He told them to bring him an emetic.\[28\] This he took and purified
himself. First Man then asked them to send the hermaphrodite to him.
When he came First Man asked him if the metate and brush\[29\] were his.
He said that they were. First Man asked him if he could cook and prepare
food like a woman, if he could weave, and brush the hair. And when he
had assured First Man that he could do all manner of woman's work, First
Man said: "Go and prepare food and bring it to me." After he had eaten,
First Man told the four chiefs what he had seen, and what his wife had
said.

At this time the Great-Coyote-Who-Was-Formed-in-the-Water came to First
Man and told him to cross the river. They made a big raft and crossed at
the place where the Male River followed through the Female River. And
all the male beings left the female beings on the river bank; and as
they rowed across the river they looked back and saw that First Woman
and the female beings were laughing. They were also behaving very
wickedly.

In the beginning the women did not mind being alone. They cleared and
planted a small field. On the other side of the river First Man and the
chiefs hunted and planted their seeds. They had a good harvest.
Nadle\[30\] ground the corn and cooked the food. Four seasons passed.
The men continued to have plenty and were happy; but the women became
lazy, and only weeds grew on their land. The women wanted fresh meat.
Some of them tried to join the men and were drowned in the river.

\[27. Informant's note: These are not the Black and White Clouds of the
First World. As there was no sun, and no true division of night and day,
time was counted by the black cloud rising and the white cloud rising.

Stevenson (1891, pp. 284-285); Matthews (1897, p. 67); Whitman (1925, p.
13); Alexander (1916, pp. 160-161).

28\. Informant's note (with recorder's): The emetic was believed to be
either *Babia woodhousei* Gray, of the thistle family, or the root of
the wild cherry. In either case, after a hot brew is drunk, copious
vomiting ensues.

29\. Informant's note: The metata and brush are symbolic of woman's
implements.

30\. Informant's note: Nadle means that which changes. Ashon nutli', or
nadle, the Turquoise Hermaphrodite, was the first man to change, or
become, as a woman.\]

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

First Woman made a plan. As the women had no way to satisfy their
passions, some fashioned long narrow rocks, some used the feathers of
the turkey, and some used strange plants (cactus). First Woman told them
to use these things. One woman brought forth a big stone. This
stone-child was later the Great Stone that rolled over the earth killing
men. Another woman brought forth the Big Birds of Tsa bida'hi; and
others gave birth to the giants and monsters who later destroyed many
people.

On the opposite side of the river the same condition existed. The men,
wishing to satisfy their passions, killed the females of mountain sheep,
lion, and antelope. Lightning struck these men. When First Man learned
of this he warned his men that they would all be killed. He told them
that they were indulging in a dangerous practice. Then the second chief
spoke: he said that life was hard and that it was a pity to see women
drowned. He asked why they should not bring the women across the river
and all live together again.

"Now we can see for ourselves what comes from our wrong doing," he said.
"We will know how to act in the future." The three other chiefs of the
animals agreed with him, so First Man told them to go and bring the
women.

After the women had been brought over the river First Man spoke: "We
must be purified," he said. "Everyone must bathe. The men must dry
themselves with white corn meal, and the women, with yellow."

This they did, living apart for 4 days. After the fourth day First Woman
came and threw her right arm around her husband. She spoke to the others
and said that she could see her mistakes, but with her husband's help
she would henceforth lead a good life. Then all the male and female
beings came and lived with each other again.

The people moved to different parts of the land. Some time passed; then
First Woman became troubled by the monotony of life. She made a plan.
She went to Atse'hashke, the Coyote called First Angry, and giving him
the rainbow she said: "I have suffered greatly in the past. I have
suffered from want of meat and corn and clothing. Many of my maidens
have died. I have suffered many things. Take the rainbow and go to the
place where the rivers cross. Bring me the two pretty children of Tqo
holt sodi, the Water Buffalo,\[31\] a boy and a girl.

The Coyote agreed to do this. He walked over the rainbow. He entered the
home of the Water Buffalo and stole the two children; and these he hid
in his big skin coat with the white fur lining. And when he returned he
refused to take off his coat, but pulled it around himself and looked
very wise,

\[31. Franciscan Fathers (1910, p. 157): Tqo holt sodi, water buffalo,
water ox, or water monster. Alexander (1916, p. 161, and note 9, p.
274).\]

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

After this happened the people saw white light in the East and in the
South and West and North. One of the deer people ran to the East, and
returning, said that the white light was a great sheet of water. The
sparrow hawk flew to the South, the great hawk to the West, and the
kingfisher to the North. They returned and said that a flood was coming.
The kingfisher said that the water was greater in the North, and that it
was near.

The flood was coming and the Earth was sinking. And all this happened
because the Coyote had stolen the two children of the Water Buffalo, and
only First Woman and the Coyote knew the truth.

When First Man learned of the coming of the water he sent word to all
the people, and he told them to come to the mountain called Sis na'jin.
He told them to bring with them all of the seeds of the plants used for
food. All living beings were to gather on the top of Sis na'jin. First
Man traveled to the six sacred mountains, and, gathering earth from
them, he put it in his medicine bag.\[32\]

The water rose steadily.

When all the people were halfway up Sis na' jin, First Man discovered
that he had forgotten his medicine bag. Now this bag contained not only
the earth from the six sacred mountains, but his magic, the medicine he
used to call the rain down upon the earth and to make things grow. He
could not live without his medicine bag, and be wished to jump into the
rising water; but the others begged him not to do this. They went to the
kingfisher and asked him to dive into the water and recover the bag.
This the bird did. When First Man had his medicine bag again in his
possession he breathed on it four times and thanked his people.

When they had all arrived it was found that the Turquoise Boy had
brought with him the big Male Reed;\[33\] and the White Shell Girl had
brought with her the big Female Reed.\[34\] Another person brought
poison ivy; and another, cotton, which was later used for cloth. This
person was the spider. First Man had with him his spruce tree\[35\]
which he planted on the top of Sis na'jin. He used his fox
medicine\[36\] to make it grow; but the spruce tree began to send out
branches and to taper at the top, so First Man planted the big Male
Reed. All the people blew on it, and it grew and grow until it reached

\[32. Informant's note: Here, and following, magic is associated with
First Man.

Recorder's note: The magic of First Man was considered white magic,
reason, logos.

33\. Informant's note: The big male reed is called luka'tso. It grows
near Santo Domingo Pueblo, not far from the home of the Turquoise Boy,
the little turquoise mountain south Of Santa Fe, N. Mex.

34\. Informant's note: The big female reed is thought to be the joint
cane which grows along the Colorado River. This was near the home of the
White Shell Girl.

35\. Recorder's note: That the tree is here called a spruce and on page
2 a pine is not explained.

36\. First Man's name, Atse'hastqin, corresponds to the sacred name of
the kit fox.\]

the canopy of the sky. They tried to blow inside the reed, but it was
solid. They asked the woodpecker to drill out the hard heart. Soon they
were able to peek through the opening, but they had to blow and blow
before it was large enough to climb through. They climbed up inside the
big male reed, and after them the water continued to rise.\[37\]

## THE FOURTH WORLD

When the people reached the Fourth World they saw that it was not a very
large place. Some say that it was called the White World; but not all
medicine men agree that this is so.

The last person to crawl through the reed was the turkey from Gray
Mountain. His feather coat was flecked with foam, for after him came the
water. And with the water came the female Water Buffalo who pushed her
head through the opening in the reed. She had a great quantity of curly
hair which floated on the water, and she had two horns, half black and
half yellow. From the tips of the horns the lightning flashed.

First Man asked the Water Buffalo why she had come and why she had sent
the flood. She said nothing. Then the Coyote drew the two babies from
his coat and said that it was, perhaps, because of them.

The Turquoise Boy took a basket and filled it with turquoise. On top of
the turquoise he placed the blue pollen, tha'di'thee do tlij, from the
blue flowers,\[38\] and the yellow pollen from the corn; and on top of
these he placed the pollen from the water flags, tquel aqa'di din; and.
again on top of these he placed the crystal, which is river pollen. This
basket he gave to the Coyote who put it between the horns of the Water
Buffalo. The Coyote said that with this sacred offering he would give
back the male child. He said that the male child would be known as the
Black Cloud or Male Rain, and that he would bring the thunder and
lightning. The female child he would keep. She would be known as the
Blue, Yellow, and White Clouds or Female Rain. She would be the gentle
rain that would moisten the earth and. help them to live. So he kept the
female child, and he placed the male child on the sacred basket between
the horns of the Water Buffalo. And the Water Buffalo disappeared, and
the waters with her..

After the water sank there appeared another person. They did not know
him, and they asked him where he had come from. He told them that he was
the badger, nahashch'id, and that he had been formed

where the Yellow Cloud had touched the Earth. Afterward this Yellow
Cloud turned out to be a sunbeam.\[39\]

## THE FIFTH WORLD

First Man was not satisfied with the Fourth World. It was a small barren
land; and the great water had soaked the earth and made the sowing of
seeds impossible. He planted the big Female Reed and it grew up to the
vaulted roof of this Fourth World. First Man sent the newcomer, the
badger, up inside the reed, but before he reached the upper world water
began to drip, so he returned and said that he was frightened.

At this time there came another strange being. First Man asked him where
he had been formed, and he told him that he had come from the Earth
itself. This was the locust.\[40\] He said that it was now his turn to
do something, and he offered to climb up the reed.

The locust made a headband of a little reed, and on his forehead he
crossed two arrows. These arrows were dressed with yellow tail feathers.
With this sacred headdress and the help of all the Holy Beings the
locust climbed up to the Fifth World. He dug his way through the reed as
he digs in the earth now. He then pushed through mud until he came to
water. When he emerged he saw a black water bird\[41\] swimming toward
him. He had arrows\[42\] crossed on the back of his head and big eyes.

The bird said: "What are you doing here? This is not your country." And
continuing, he told the locust that unless he could make magic be would
not allow him to remain.

The black water bird drew an arrow from back of his head, and shoving it
into his mouth drew it out his nether extremity. He inserted it
underneath his body and drew it out of his mouth.

"That is nothing," said the locust. He took the arrows from his headband
and pulled them both ways through his body, between his shell and his
heart. The bird believed that the locust possessed great medicine, and
he swam away to the East, taking the water with him.

Then came the blue water bird from the South, and the yellow water bird
from the West, and the white water bird from the North, and everything
happened as before. The locust performed the magic with

\[39. Informant's and interpreter's note: The Four Worlds were really 12
worlds, or stages of development; but different medicine men divide them
differently according to the ceremony held. For the narrative they call
them the Four Dark Worlds, and the Fifth World, the one we live in. An
old medicine man explained that the Sixth World would be that of the
spirit; and that the one above that would be "cosmic," melting into one.

40\. Informant's note: The name of the locust was not given.

Franciscan Fathers (1912, p. 123): locust, nahacha'gi. This also means
grasshopper, cicada.

41\. Informant's note: The water birds were grebes.

his arrows; and when the last water bird had gone he found himself
sitting on land.

The locust returned to the lower world and told the people that the
beings above had strong medicine, and that he had had great difficulty
getting the best of them.

Now two dark clouds and two white clouds rose, and this meant that two
nights and two days had passed, for there was still no sun. First Man
again sent the badger to the upper world, and he returned covered with
mud, terrible mud. First Man gathered chips of turquoise which he
offered to the five Chiefs of the Winds who\[43\] lived in the uppermost
world of all. They were pleased with the gift, and they sent down the
winds and dried the Fifth World.

First Man and his people saw four dark clouds and four white clouds
pass, and then they sent the badger up the reed. This time when the
badger returned he said that he had come out on solid earth. So First
Man and First Woman led the people to the Fifth World, which some call
the Many Colored Earth and some the Changeable Earth. They emerged
through a lake surrounded by four mountains. The water bubbles in this
lake when anyone goes near.\[44\]

Now after all the people had emerged from the lower worlds First Man and
First Woman dressed the Mountain Lion with yellow, black, white, and
grayish corn and placed him on one side. They dressed the Wolf with
white tail feathers and placed him on the other side. They divided the
people into two groups. The first group was told to choose whichever
chief they wished. They made their choice, and, although they thought
they had chosen the Mountain Lion, they found that they had taken the
Wolf for their chief. The Mountain Lion was the chief for the other
side. And these people who had the Mountain Lion for their chief turned
out to be the people of the Earth. They were to plant seeds and harvest
corn. The followers of the Wolf chief became the animals and birds; they
turned into all the creatures that fly and crawl and run and swim.

And after all the beings were divided, and each had his own form, they
went their ways.

Chief, Nichi lichi, the Red Wind; the Third Chief, Nichi shada ji
na'laghali, the Wind Turning from the Sun; the Fourth Chief, Nichi
qa'hashchi, the Wind with Many Points; the Fifth Chief, Nichi che do et
siedee, the Wind with the Fiery Temper.

44\. Informant's note: The place of emergence is said to be near Pagosa
Springs, Colo. The white people have put a wire fence around our Sacred
Lake.

Matthews (1897, p. 135): place of emergence. Franciscan Fathers (1910,
pp. 347-354): The First or Dark World: ants, beetles, dragonflies,
locusts, bats, frogs. The Second or Blue World: blue heron, swallow
people. They lived in rough, lumpy houses with the entrance in a hole in
the top of the roof or in eaves. The Third or Yellow World:
grasshoppers, etc. The Fourth or Larger World was of All Colors: four
snow-covered mountains; the Pueblo People; corn, pumpkins.

This is the. story of the Four Dark Worlds and the Fifth, the World we
live in. Some medicine men tell us that there are two worlds above us,
the first is the World of the Spirits of Living Things, the second is
the Place of Melting into One.
