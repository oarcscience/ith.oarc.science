## ON THE JOURNEY TOWARDS SHADOW MOUNTAIN

 There were fourteen people now, the twelve made by White Bead Woman and
the two children stolen from the east. At Red Lake the first man
created, who was the head man, stuck his cane into the ground and found
that he was close to water. The water was close to the top of this hole.
One of the men said, “The water is close.” The man who said this got the
name of the Close-Water-Clan. The people continued on past Shonto and on
past the west side of Kayenta, and on to where the hill drops down which
is called Sloping Hill, or ǹde·lk’id.

 At a spring below the hill they built a dam using a rock for a wall.
This was done for mud was coming down the hill because of the extra
water. The place was muddy and they laid rocks on the bottom of the
spring so they could get clear water. As they continued on the second
man put his <span id="page_98">p. 98</span> cane into the ground and
pulled it out. Water came out, and it was salty and muddy. A man said,
“It is muddy and salty.” This man was given the name of the Muddy or Mud
Clan. The whole place was getting muddy and the ground was like
quicksand. There was a wall built using large rocks by all fourteen
people. This was so the water would not go all over and get everything
muddy and become like quicksand.

 The people spent several years at these different places. The wall that
was built looks as if the cement between the rocks has handprints from
these people. While they were so busy making the dam, the pet female big
snake disappeared. After the snake disappeared, she went to
Rock-That-Steals or cé’ani’įhi. This she-snake went on towards Shonto
and got a drink at the spring called Shonto and which is one mile above
where the trading post is now. She went on to Kaibito, where there is a
window rock, on the point of White Mesa. This was made by the snake. A
man was sent out to bring her back.

 As this man came over the hill at Shonto, the female snake was going
over White Mesa. He saw the reflection off of her back. This man ran
towards the top of White Mesa and then saw her going over Red Mesa. When
he got to Red Mesa, he saw the snake going to the northwest of Red Mesa.
When this man got on top of Red Mesa, he saw her go towards ził nanes
ƛ’i·ží which was to the northwest. He tried to run after her from Red
Mesa to the northwest, but before he could get on top of the hill, she
slowly changed into a mountain. As she went along, she got longer and
longer and finally became what is known today as Crooked Mountain.

 All of the changes from people and animals into stone or mountains were
done by themselves for they had this power. When this man got to Crooked
Mountain, he could not find the snake. He talked to Crooked Mountain and
found the mountain was the female snake. The snake mountain told him
that in the future all of the things which had been changed into rocks
and mountains would change back into whatever they were before. This was
to happen when the world changes or comes to an end.

 When the man went back to the people, he told them what happened and so
they moved on. How many years they stayed there is not known. The people
went along a path where the highway to Flagstaff is now. There is a gap
on this side of Kayenta near McDonald’s Trading Post in Monument Valley.
It was at this time that these people divided into two groups. Some went
to Batatican where they were stationed at Where-the-Ruins-Are, bitˣ
áht’ahdi kín. The other group went on to Kayenta.

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

 At this time they started to irrigate with the water from the river at
Kayenta. At that time there was water in the river. Some of the people
went west to Kayenta, near Wild or Fierce Spring. The group was growing
quite large by this time for there were many children by now. There were
the men, women and children of the original twelve plus the Arrow People
who had been captured. Some of the people were told to live at Fierce
Spring forever. The other group went near the north of Kayenta where
there is a Black Post. They call this post Many-Hair, ’a’atání. The
people got the name because there was a tanning place where the hair was
left behind, which was near Black Post. There is much arguing about the
story at this point.

 These people were still there at Oljetoh, which means moon-water, near
Monument Valley. Earlier before this time there had been no name for
this spring. A woman went to get some water from the spring and looked
in and saw the moon reflected on the water. Because of this, they named
the spring Oljetoh. Soon after this the people started to move eastward
of Oljetoh. They traveled on until they came to a black rock and a man
wanted to stay there. He wanted to stay there forever and because he had
the power turned into a rock called Black Post.

 To the west of Dennehotso was a man who also wanted to stay there
forever and so he also turned into a rock called Black Post. This also
happened to the west of Dennehotso to a family who were behind all the
rest of the people who were marching up ahead. The whole family became
tired, and they stayed behind and turned into a rock which was later
called Baby Rock. This rock looks as if a woman were carrying a baby on
her back. There are many different women, men and animals who turned
into rock during these early times.

 The people traveled on through Dennehotso to Mexican Spring, nakaĭ tō.
West of Mexican Spring there was a wash that is round because the water
runs almost in a circle there. On they traveled from Mexican Springs to
a round mountain this side of Farmington. This mountain is round and it
looks as if it were round in all directions and as if it were turning
around. Towards and beyond Shiprock were two black rocks at the spring.

 The people preparing lunch met two people there. One man went to get
water from the spring and met a man and woman there. The strangers said
to each other, “Hello,” and the Created Navaho got out his tobacco bag.
When they had taken out their pipes, they found they both had the same
shape and design. The man and woman also had a sack of <span
id="page_100">p. 100</span> tobacco that looked the same. Each
recognized these things and so they said they belonged to the same clan.
Because of this they were friends. The Created Navaho was of the
Bitter-Water-Clan. The stranger was also a Navaho and of the
Bitter-Water-Clan. The stranger belonged to the other group of people
who had gone the other way to reach their ancient land. These two men
were then to be called Coming-to-the-Water-Yellow-Pasture-Clan, tắ·ă pān
łtsṓī, because of their meeting.

 The people had lunch at this spring and went towards the place called
Braced Rock, tsḗ bēyē’ānaĕ áhˣá. They lived here for quite awhile and
then left a turquoise stone man and woman, a jet man and woman, a white
bead man and woman and an oyster shell man woman there. They forgot
these stone figures when they left. White men dug up the turquoise man
and took it away and that is why the rock almost fell down. White men
were afraid and so braced the rock a few years ago. The carved turquoise
was like a person and three to four inches tall. These figures were used
as a power to protect the family, but some moved away and forgot them.
Only the turquoise man and woman were used in this way. These people had
these figures with them from the beginning.

 Also at this place was a large rock that these people held up by using
a rock wall underneath it. The whites have now put a post under it to
hold it up. When this rock falls the world will change or end. This rock
almost fell once during the war, and if it had, it would have been us
who would have been beaten instead of the Japanese or Germans. The
people continued to where there was a canyon which had a waterfall
called tˣó hˣă’ădắ el tī·hī·. This is north of Gallup, New Mexico. There
were large holds in the rock caused by the water and water laid in these
holes. One man said, “There is a lot of water in there.” They called
this man the Big-Water-Clan or tˣó cohni.

 On the east side of Tohatchi there are two cottonwood trees and that
was where the two children were found that were taken to the west to
learn from White Bead Woman. Here there is a hole about three feet deep
and twelve inches in diameter. One of the people dipped a lot of water
from here and still much remained. This man said, “There is a lot of
water.” The people went there and found the children. These two children
had been found in a corn field and the gods took them to the west. The
Created Navaho left the children here and they told the children to tell
the men and women all that had been taught to them by White Bead Woman.
The group that left San Francisco Mountains met them here. (The story
from San Francisco Mountains is known to F. G., but this story must be
told by another medicine man. Frequently this was the case in the story
telling <span id="page_101">p. 101</span> when a story or name was so
sacred that the telling of such secrets would literally drain the
medicine man of a portion of his power.)

 From this point on the people divided into many groups and forrned into
the different clans. After the various people separated many things
happened. During the time of the wars with the other tribes, there was a
woman from the Red House Clan, kin łí·čí·hí·, who was going crazy. She
was crazy about men and doing many wrong things. She went south towards
the Apache country. The Apache and Navaho were not one people at this
time.

 This woman went to the Apaches and married one of the men of the tribe.
She was pregnant before she married the Apache. After she lived with
these people for awhile, she had a baby girl. She took good care of the
child until she got old enough to get married. The mother gave the girl
to her husband, who was an Apache chief. The mother was going man crazy
again and the chief wanted to kill his wife because of this. Both the
girl and her mother had children from this Apache chief. Between them
they had five girls and four boys.

 An Apache woman, the mother-in-law of these women, told them they were
going to be killed. This Apache woman told them to run away to their
clan. She said, “Run away and be careful or you will be killed in the
morning.” This lady made a lunch for them to take on their journey. She
was watching out for them every moment. The chief told her to watch the
two women so they could not escape. The old woman hid the lunch and told
them where it was. “Your children are Navaho, but the Apaches will do
nothing to them for they are the chief’s children.” Both of the women
were playing around with other men.

 The old woman told them, “Try and be careful as you go towards the
Navaho and do not show footprints for I am not going to tell them where
you went. I am going to hide this knowledge from them. I will not tell
them anything.” During the night the two women started out to where the
lunch was hidden and began traveling that night. When day came, they hid
themselves so they would not be seen. In the morning there were groups
of Apaches searching for them all around. At night they started all over
again and hid that morning again. In the morning the Apaches came back
and forth in groups again. Towards the end of the day the men started
going home again.

 The women in the morning started moving again, stepping on rocks. They
traveled all night and hid when morning came. The next morning <span
id="page_102">p. 102</span> the Apaches were coming again and about
three o’clock they passed by the women, but they were hunting in groups
of only two or three now. The Apaches went back and the women started
out again. At midnight the old woman could go no further. She had
swollen ankles and knees, but she crawled on going easy and crying as
she went. They went on to the other side of Flagstaff, on to the east
side of the mountains (San Francisco), on to the southwest of Winslow to
Square cactus Mountain or xoš dik’áni.

 The mother crawled on the other side of this mountain to show where the
Navaho people were and where her people lived. She kept crawling and
crawling to get to the top of the mountain. Finally, she got to the top
and she told her daughter which was the way to go. She was to go to the
mountain near the Loop called Midst of Buttes or čéžin bi·’. She said,
“There is a place called Killing Sheep Mountain or dibé ńžígáń on the
other side of this mountain.”

 The mother told the girl where all of these places were to be found.
“There are people living on the other side of Black Mountain in a place
called Canyon de Chelly. That is where I came from. You have a
grandfather and grandmother and other relatives there.” She told the
girl to go on. “Don’t try to wander off any place. Don’t turn back.” The
girl was about twenty-one or twenty-two at this time. The old woman told
the girl, “I will stay here and wait until my leg and ankle get well.”
She was really going back to her children even if the Apaches killed
her.

 Again she told the girl, “At this time of the year the Navaho hunt at
dibé ńžígáń. There is a river, the Little Colorado River, and even if it
is high, don’t turn back. Use a stick to tell where the shallow parts
are and don’t go into the deep water.” The older woman had a little
lunch left so she gave it to the girl and the old lady started crying.
She told the girl for the last time, “Don’t worry about me. Somehow you
might get back to your people and be with them again.”

 The young girl started out and stayed at Winslow. When she came to the
river, she got a stick and did as she had been told. When she went
across the river she came to Killing Sheep Mountain. While she was on
this hill, she saw some people riding horses in the distance at a place
called Coyote Place or ma’i· šižé·’. One of the men saw her on the hill.
They said, “There is someone walking way over on the top of that hill.”
These two riders came up to her, and they saw a girl sitting there.
These two riders asked questions, but she answered only in Apache. At
last they understood when she mentioned her grandmother and grandfather.

 They said, “It must be the woman who went to the Apache and must be the
woman called Running- or Wild-Woman. They started back with <span
id="page_103">p. 103</span> the girl and said, “We will find out about
this when we get back to ma’i· šižé·’.” The people asked where she came
from and she said, “Pine Canyon in Apache country.” She told everything
that had happened and mentioned her grandmother and grandfather. Some of
her relatives were at this camp, and they all started back to Chinle and
on to Canyon de Chelly. Later the girl married one of the Navaho and
started to raise more children. The people named her Red House Clan or
khĭn łinchī́nĭ. She got her name by the canyon called deščî·ni’eszáń.
That is where the Red Streak Clan came from. The children left there are
the same clan that live there today. About this time other groups had
their origin.

 This is a story about the diné nókoλô·ni·, or Eskimos. (These are
actually the Athapascans to the north, but the Navaho believe them to be
the Eskimos.) This is also the story of the Fire Dance. One time there
was a man who went to where there was a large crowd gathered. This man
stayed for awhile and married a woman in the dark. This woman had no
flesh on her nose for she was of the Insect People. This woman told
someone to go and tell her man, her husband, to come and eat Indian
tortillas. There are like Mexican tortillas with corn husks, corn meal
and meat which is boiled. This man did not want to come for he was
bashful of this woman.

 The Fire Dance took place shortly after this. There were many women
like this for they were born that way. They were Insect People at that
time and all carried knives. All of the women wanted to cut this man
into pieces for his not wanting his wife. However, the man was not
killed. They began to dance inside the hogan and outside towards the
north.

 They left the Fire Dance, and as they walked along they said these
things, “From now on when we face the south from the north the people
are going to freeze up. The winds will make them very cold.” The wind
was to come and go inside the Insect People’s noses and cause it to be
very cold. If there is a cold north wind, it is caused by this. These
Insect People went north and became the Eskimos. They were told never to
be seen again by the Navaho. The Navaho *have* seen them and that is why
the world has trouble like it has now.

 A long time ago at Blue House, kin do·iłiži near kintˣe·l, there lived
a Navaho girl no one wanted. Her parents were dead so she went to some
neighboring Navaho to live by grinding corn and by cooking. Even though
she was a good looking girl, no one wanted her for a wife so she
wandered from hogan to hogan. One day she was out looking for food when
she saw some smoke coming out of the ground. She went up to it <span
id="page_104">p. 104</span> and looked down into a small hole. Inside
was an old woman spinning a web.

 The old woman looked up as she saw the shadow of the girl and said to
her, “Come down to my house.” The old woman was Spider Woman or
na·sžé’i·’eszą́’. The Navaho girl said, “The hole is too small,” but
Spider Woman said, “It is big enough.” The Spider Woman blew at the hole
four times, each time it got bigger and bigger until it was big enough
for the girl to climb through. The girl sat by Spider Woman and watched
her weave.

 Spider Woman had a long stick with a hole in one end, and she passed
the thread in and out of the loom making a blanket. She was making a
design of everything in the sky. The Navaho were later told not to make
use of this design in their blankets. Spider Woman also told the Navaho
not to make the designs too fancy. After Spider Woman had finished
weaving the blanket, she went up to the ground above and lowered the Sun
by blowing it to the west. She then asked the girl to stay the night as
it was getting dark. As soon as the Sun had gone down, Spider Man came
in. He asked where this girl had come from and why she was there. His
wife told him that everyone hated her and she felt sorry for her.

 The girl stayed for four days and watched Spider Woman make blankets.
She learned the songs that went with the making of each part of the
loom. There are songs still used today. One is used while spinning
called the Spinning Song and the others while the tools are made. After
she learned these things she went back to the hogan where she was
staying and asked for cotton of three colors, yellow, black and white.
At that time the Navaho had cotton and used coal, plants, blossoms and
sandstones of all kinds for the dye. The colors stuck because of the
songs and prayers. The Navaho girl took the cotton and put up a loom
different from Spider Woman and like the Navaho use today and then began
to weave. She completed one blanket that day. The following day she
began another blanket and some Hopis came and watched her. Then they
went home and made some blankets just like hers.

 The girl learned to make all designs, birds and animals. The Hopi
learned how to weave from the Navaho. The girl was told by Spider Woman
that she ought to know the songs in order to go to the extreme and make
all of the designs. Spider Woman taught the girl all the songs and
prayers. Spider Woman chose weaving for the Navaho in the beginning. She
told the girl to leave an opening for the home of Spider Woman, just the
same. Nowadays women do not know the songs and do not leave the
openings.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

 In the early days the Navaho knew how to weave simply, but did not know
how to make designs. They were picking these designs up, but hostilities
began with the Utes, nṓdā’ă, Mexicans, nakaí, and other tribes. Each of
these groups were stealing from the Navaho. The Navaho forgot the
designs and the Pueblos took over. First Woman taught the Navaho how to
weave. She taught them to learn to weave in the first world. Down below
they learned to weave a Beautiful Design Skirt, which was below the
knees. The Hopi took over and made it shorter. At this time it was made
from cotton.

 When they got on this earth the people started raising sheep, and soon
used wool for weaving. The Hopi learned to weave with the various
designs just like they do now. The carrying basket and the water bottle
were learned from Thunder God, ’iˇn̓i’. Now it has been taken away by the
Comanche and other tribes. The Navaho learned this from the Thunder God.
He had a water jug and they copied it from him. In the sand paintings,
underneath the Thunder Bird are water jugs represented. The Thunder Bird
represents the rain and represents the clouds carrying the rain.

 There was once a man who was a great gambler. He was very lucky at
winning many things. He was called Earth Winner or ni’xʷi·ł bį hi·’.
After a time of being very lucky, he began to lose everything he had
won. He talked too much about what he had and whom he had gotten it
from. All of of the people decided it was not fair for someone to talk
like that so they took a black bow and put it on his tongue and cut it
out. The people put his tongue on backwards, and the man began to mutter
a new language. They put him on an arrow and shot him to heaven, and he
kept mumbling all of the time. When he was shot into the air, he said,
“I will be back someday to settle with you.”

 When this man got to mid-heaven, he met Bego Black, Bego Blue, Bego
Yellow, Bego White, and Bego Silver living up there. These Begos asked
him, “Where did you come from?” He said, “I am coming from below where
the Earth People live. They put me in bad shape for they cut out my
tongue and put it in backwards. I want you to make another Rhino. At one
time they used to eat the Surface People.” The Begos fixed him a Rhino,
but when they said, “Bego Rhino,” the figure turned into a cow. This cow
began to moo and soon had a long horn. The Begos said to this man, “You
will live on this in future days.”

 The man said, “I want you to make a fierce bear like the one who ate
people on earth. They used to eat Surface People. I want you to make
<span id="page_106">p. 106</span> this.” Again the Begos fixed a figure
and said, “Bego Bear,” and this figure turned into a hog and began to
grunt. The Begos said, “That will be your food and that is what you will
live on.” The man said again, “I want you to make me a flying monster
(eagle). It used to eat Surface People.” The Begos made another figure
and when they said. “Bego Eagle,” it turned into a chicken—a rooster.
The Begos said, “That is what you are going to live on in future days.”

 After all of these things had happened, this Death Bego said. “I want
you to make a walking rock. They used to eat Earth Surface People.” The
Begos made one and said, “Bego Walking Rock,” and the figure turned into
a wagon. The Begos told the man, “That is what you are going to live on
in the future.” At last the man said, “I want you to make me two
antelopes who used to eat Earth Surface People.” The Begos made this
last figure and when they said, “Bego Antelopes,” the figures turned
into a mule. The Begos told the man, “That is what you will live on.”

 All the Begos told the Death Bego, “We did not make anything for you.
We tried, but they just turned into certain animals and things.” This
man and his goods were sent away. They all started off and came down in
the land to the east, and that is where they live (Europe). The
descendants of this man are thought to be Spanish. The Pueblos and some
Navaho believe they got the sheep and horses from these Spaniards. The
Navaho had sheep over here which had long curly black, brown and white
wool. They also had goats of all kinds and horses and small mules. The
big mules, sheep with rough heavy wool and the chickens came from
overseas.
