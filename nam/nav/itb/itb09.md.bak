## THE MAN WITH FOUR NAMES<span id="page_113_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_113_note_1.md)

 Once there was a man with four names. His first name was
Looking-for-Favors or náxodidáhí. His second name was
One-Who-Goes-Back-to-Look-at-Fish or ’adáńł’íní. His third name was
Home-Made-of-Down (Feathers) or ’ac’ os be·be yaní. His fourth and last
name was Chap-all-Over-His-Skin or Rough-Surface, ká·dič’iží. This man
with four names was wandering around with nothing to do for he had no
home and no friends, except his turkey.

 The Wind People and some others who were wandering around said, “We
will help him. He is a wanderer with no home.” The gods had a meeting
and they talked about what they were going to do with Chap Man. The gods
took him in order to help him and to get him back on his feet. <span
id="page_114">p. 114</span> When all of the gods had gathered for
another meeting with this man, they decided upon what to do. Some went
out and chopped down a fir tree. The log was about three feet in
diameter.

 The gods were going to make a hole in the center of the log so they
asked the Black and Blue Wind to do the drilling. One was to drill
through the center of the log from one end and the other from the
opposite end. According to this the white man makes drills or drills
things. These things the Black and Blue Winds said they could do. The
Black Wind went in a circle at the top of the log just like a
whirlwind—only very small. The Black Wind went left to right and the
Blue Wind from right to left. They went all the way through from the
same end each time they drilled. The Blue Wind had started from the
bottom, and he made a hole big enough for someone to crawl through.

 The Wind People hardened the wood and water-proofed it by polishing
until it was shiny. They were finished now except they had to find
something to close each end of the log, a lid. The gods decided upon a
rock-like quartz or diamond which was something like glass to use for
each end of the log. It was very hard to break and it could be easily
seen through. The gods put the man in the log and put the quartz lids in
place.

 The turkey ran around the log and got excited when Chap Man got inside.
Chap Man asked the gods if the turkey, his only domesticated animal,
could get inside, too. The gods said no and that the turkey was to
protect him from evil. The reason the gods put Chap Man inside the log
was this: There was a man, Raising-Deer-Man, who hid all the game
animals in a cave. The gods decided to put Chap Man in the log so he
could go and find where the animals—deer, antelope and mountain
sheep—were hidden. They wanted him to drift down the river for there
were too many people guarding the Deer Raiser, bįh yiǹłt’ání, and Chap
Man would have been captured. So that is why the gods decided to make
use of Chap Man. Now he could save himself besides helping others.

 The Chap Man did not know why he was going or where, but he knew he was
to do certain things, and the Holy Wind told him about them. After he
turned loose all of the animals, he gained many friends for before he
did this he had none. The log was put in the water of the San Juan River
near Pikes Peak and it floated along with turkey on the north side of
the river. The turkey was walking on Kaibab Mountain, over at Kaibab
Forest, when the log got to Colorado and San Juan River junction.

 Along came a Hippo or a Water Animal who took out the plug from the log
and pulled Chap Man to the bottom of the water. The Hippo took <span
id="page_115">p. 115</span> the log to the shore and put it on the bank.
Because of this logs are always washed up on the shore. Meanwhile turkey
was looking for the log, but could not find it along the river. Suddenly
he saw the log and at once went up to it. His master was not there and
he kept wandering around looking for him. The gods knew all that
happened. The Wind carried a message from the gods to the Black, Flint
or Fire God. Hashch’ĕ́zhĭni, the Fire God, has also the shape of the
crow. Whenever you see a crow and hawk fighting together, the crow will
have a torch with him on his body. He touches the birds with this torch
and makes them go faster.

 The Black God started off to the rescue and went to where the river
joins and down to the bottom of the water. Here he found a house of the
Hippo. There were lights like balls of fire all colors of lights, all
mixed up surrounding the house. The house was only one room and the
lights ran right across the windows, some around the windows and some
were in designs like neon lights. The Black God went inside the house,
but the Chap Person was not there, only Hippo.

 The Hippo asked, “Why do you come around here? This is not the place
for Surface People to come around.” The Black God said, “I want my
grandson back. That is why I have come here.” When the Black God had
come inside, he was wearing ragged clothes, had not washed himself and
was very dirty. “Where are you coming from with all those raggy things
and with your dirty body? Why don’t you wash? You smell, you stink. Why
don’t you beat it? I haven’t seen your grandson.”

 Black God answered him saying, “If you think that way then I will burn
up the whole house and the water and the earth and the heaven and the
rest of the gods. All will be burned. There will be no more earth or
gods if you don’t give me back my grandson.” The Black God continued, “I
am going to put this place on fire.” All of these things had been said
four times. He had a torch of rock and he rubbed them together. It was
yellow stuff and the torch began to smoke and the lights in the house
began to rattle and spark.

 The Fire God began to rub his flints together and rubbed them some
more, and after he had done it twice the lights began to pop and give
out sparks. The Hippo tried to please the god and said. “You can have
back your grandson. Don’t burn down my house. Only give me a piece of
turquoise, white bead, jet and oyster shell.” The Black God answered
him. “You know I am wearing raggy things and no beady things. Where am I
going to get the gift to give to you? Why didn’t you say so in the first
place?” The Black God then took the gifts from under his raggy <span
id="page_116">p. 116</span> clothes where he had hidden them. Nowadays
the rich people do the same things.

 The Black God said, “Why didn’t you tell me before instead of saying
you had not seen him?” The Black God had a piece of soft cotton string
as long as his shoulder or about one and a half feet long. He tied all
four stones two and a half to three inches apart on this string and gave
it to the Hippo. After the Hippo received his gift, he opened a door in
the floor of his house. The Hippo was gone for a long time. The Black
God wondered, “Where in the ch’īndi did that Hippo go?”

 At last the Hippo arrived with Chap Man behind him, trying to hide him
from the Black God’s sight. He kept the Chap Person behind him until he
had told the Black God what he wanted to say. “From now on the Earth
People will copy the lights and the water that burns.” These are fuel,
oil, powder, matches and other things. Then the Black God said, “I am
going to use the same things on the earth for use in the future time.
Some of these things will be dangerous.” (On both sides of the water and
earth.) That is why some people drown in the water or are killed by
gunpowder and electricity. This happens because of what they said.

 The Hippo gave the Chap Person back to the god. “From this time
forward,” it was said, “when a person drowns there must be a gift made,
like the Black God gave to me. This must be done before the person will
be brought back to life. This gift must be given to me, the Water God,
and must be given no matter what tribe the person belongs to. Some
Surface People will invent things like the objects in my house in the
future time. This water will turn into something useful to be burned to
make power with.” Such things as the power gotten from the water.

 “There are two kinds of liquids, one that will burn and the other that
will not. All of this is to be used in the future time.” Those which
were to burn were to be the gas and oil to be used as fuel, and that
which was used but did not burn, the water. Each time these things were
said these words were added, “This will happen in the future times,”
Thus, Black God got the man back from the Hippo. He went up to the
surface and once again Chap Man was placed in the log and closed in and
pushed back into the river.

 Chap Man passed through the Grand Canyon, through the area where
Boulder Dam is now, and on to the Gulf of California. There were many
weeds in the sea when he got there. The man could not get to shore
because of them and he was stuck in the water. Meanwhile turkey was once
again <span id="page_117">p. 117</span> wandering around and had no way
to help his master. The turkey had once more gone on traveling to help
his master. The Wind People began working and blew the log to shore. The
Wind People and the gods living in that area opened the log.

 The Chap Man was a god, but he had not taken care of himself as to how
he ate or acted. That is why he was like a wanderer having no power or
friends. He was put in the log so he could get back his power by doing
some good deeds. In this way he got back into shape as a god should be.
When Chap Man got out of the log, he was covered all over with a green,
fluffy material just like wool. It was sticky and green like water, but
it came from inside the log. When he came from the log, he was stiff and
tired because of his long journey.

 The gods washed him with water and left him there by himself and the
gods went back to their own jobs. Now the Man-with-Four-Names had
regained some of the power and knowledge he had lost because of his
wrong doings. Along the shore it was flat and sandy and looked good
enough that anything planted would grow. Chap Man was just thinking
about planting, but he had no seeds. He said, “My turkey, what do you
think about planting along this beach?” This is what he said to his
turkey. The turkey spread his wings and tail and the turkey’s head
wattle over his right eye began to grow. The turkey meant, “Yes, we can
do something about it.” Chap Man laid some cloth on the beach and the
turkey stepped on top of it and shook his body. Chap Man had taken off
some of his clothes and laid them on the ground. Turkey shook and grey
corn came out of his feathers and dropped onto the cloth.

 The Chap Man started to plant the corn. He planted in a circle. This is
how they used to plant in the early times. It was still in a straight
row. He planted until the sun set, but he had done little. At last he
went and made his bed on the beach. He was lying in the center of the
corn field for there was no other place to spend the night.

 After he had laid down, he heard someone talking. He heard someone say,
“We heard someone yelling for help. Where did they go?” Chap Man lay
there listening while the people began to plant all of the corn. A
little later they said, “We finished planting the corn.” They yelled
again, “In the future time the future people will not plant at night for
it will be bad luck.” Many Wind People helped to plant. They made a
circle and planted a large amount of ground. They finished in such a
short time for they were gods and they were the ones who had helped Chap
Man out of the log.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

 In the morning when Chap Man awoke, he found there were small plants of
corn in the beach already about two and one-half inches high. The leaves
of corn had stripes across it. Chap Man was glad about the planting and
that the corn was growing. That morning he started to the southwest to
investigate this new country. As he wandered he came upon two hogans.
When he started for the hogan, he was bashful about his badger moccasins
for they were very dirty, ragged and worn out. He was ashamed and so he
took them off and left them and his bow and arrows away from the hogan.

 He continued on and went barefooted into the first hogan and there he
saw a beautiful young girl on the north side of the hogan. He did not
say anything, but went to the south side while the girl stayed on the
north side of the hogan. This hogan was full of turquoise, white bead,
jet and oyster shell baskets. All of these were stacked up in a pile.
After he went in to the hogan, there came along a man, He-Who-Raises or
He-Who-Wants-to-Look-at-Fish, tó·’nêinét’įhí. He had tried to become
supreme over the Sun, White Bead Woman, Pollen Boy and He Who Raises. He
failed in his attempt, and the power which he had was supreme only in
this area and over certain things.

 This man took the moccasins and the bow and arrows and put them on top
of the stack of baskets. He turned to his daughter and said. “You are
not to leave my son-in-law’s moccasins and things outside.” Meanwhile
the sun had gone down and the old man said. “I want my son-in-law to
have something to eat.” The man talked awhile and then said. “Don’t go
towards that mountain over there.” He was speaking of East Mountain over
on the California coast near San Diego.

 Chap Man noticed the baskets and he later found that they had belonged
to this man’s late sons-in-law. He was told this by the Holy Wind. The
man and this young girl stole this stuff from the sons-in-law when they
had died. The woman, who was his daughter, was told to go and get food
in the other hogan and to tell her mother not to look at her son-in-law.
This might have been a signal for the mother-in-law to try and poison
her new son-in-law.

 This is where the mother-in-law taboo first came from. The reason for
this is that when boys go to war and have looked at their mother-in-law,
they can be killed more easily. People now would have been more easily
killed if the mother-in-law had come in to see Chap Man. The reason for
mother-in-law taboo in the early days was also for practice so you would
be quick on your feet or to practice on your feet. She made this rule,
the <span id="page_119">p. 119</span> Mother-in-Law God, “From now on if
a man looks at his mother-in-law he will become weakened, his knees will
shiver and he will be weak. If you have intercourse with your
mother-in-law, your father-in-law might become jealous.”

 If you look at your mother-in-law, you will get weak and your heart
will beat faster. You will be scared because it is she who weakens
you.<span id="page_119_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_119_note_1.md) If a person
gets into the service or in the war and goes to the battlefield, he will
have his brain power taken away and his mind will get bad. In old age
the people who look at their mothers-in-law will have their eyes become
bad and they will finally be blinded in old age. The gun sights will
multiply and you will not know what to do.

 Deer Raiser said, “My son-in-law,” all the time to Chap Man. This god’s
wife put the poison on the east side of the seed mush that was in the
marriage basket. At that time his mother-in-law was to kill him by
secret powder. This powder was bones that were crushed and ground. Dead
person’s bones, fat or meat was used. This was to kill the Chap Man and
thus gain all his possessions. The daughter set the mush before him, but
the Wind spoke to him and only Chap Man could hear. “Do not eat on the
east side of the marriage basket, for it is poisoned to kill you.”

 During these early days the people did not have the same wedding
ceremony as now, but it came later. There were resemblances to the
ceremony of today, however. When the boy and girl were married, the old
man said, “In the future this basket will be used with corn pollen
sprinkled on it from the east to the west and to the south and north.
The man shall pick up meal from the east and then the girl. Meal will be
picked up from the south, west, north and finally from the center.”

 At this time they used no water in the ceremony for this came later.
Now they bring water with them to wash their hands. This means the
couple will not blame anyone, the medicine man or anyone else for their
<span id="page_120">p. 120</span> being married. The girl sits to the
south and the man to the north. The father of the man sits on the south
with the mother of the man next to her husband. This ceremony is the
Good Way. These positions are the same as the prayer sticks. There are
different kinds of prayer sticks, but these are the Good Way prayer
sticks.

 Hearing what the Little Holy Wind said, the Chap Man did not eat from
that side of the basket. The basket which was brought to him was a white
bead basket. There was some kind of grass seed, tlō·’dḗī, that was given
to Chap Man. There is some of this found at Gray Mountain. The bush is
about two feet high and the seed is ground like corn and fixed just like
corn. After they had eaten the grass seed mush, the Wind whispered, “Do
not have intercourse with the girl tonight. Do not fool around with this
girl. If you have intercourse, the bear will catch you.” He did not have
intercourse with the girl because she was married to her own father and
his father-in-law. He spent a night with the girl in the hogan.

 In the morning the girl went to the other hogan and got more seeds to
grind. When the day was finished, the mother put poison on the west side
of the basket. This time the Wind told the Chap Man, “It has poison on
the west. Eat on all the other sides, but the west,” and this Chap Man
did. After eating and listening to the old man, Chap Man decided to go
to the mountain, anyway. When he got to the mountain, there suddenly
appeared a bear. This great bear opened his mouth to bite Chap Man, but
he said a word and the bear could do nothing to him. Now the bear could
not eat him.

 After Chap Man looked around he started back to the hogan. The old man
had gone there to turn into that bear. After Chap Man got to the hogan
the god said, “Don’t do on to the south side of Blue Mountain for it is
very dangerous.” Afterwards he asked where Chap Man had been, and he
said, “I went over there and met a large bear that tried to eat me.” He
told about what had happened to him and the god said, “I told you not to
go over there.”

 That evening the poison was placed on the south side of the basket and
the same things happened. In the morning the poison was placed on the
north side of the basket and all happened as before. In the morning the
god told him again not to go to the south side of Blue Mountain. The
next morning, disobeying as usual, he started to Blue Mountain. When he
got there, he looked around and met a big snake. He said another word
and the snake could do nothing to him. Again he went back to the hogan
and had his supper. This time the basket had poison all around, but none
in the center. He once more was told by the Wind.

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

 The old man wanted to know what he had been doing that day. He told him
about his experiences and the god said, “You are loco; you do not mind
me and you go over there.” He said again, “Do not go to the West
Mountain tomorrow.” That night the Wind said again, “Do not have
intercourse with the girl.” So he obeyed the instructions the Wind had
given him. Next morning there was poison all over the meal and so he
drank only water and ate nothing.

 In the morning after his meal he went west and while there he met a big
tornado. Once again he said a word and this tornado jumped over him
being unable to do anything against him. If you know the holy name of
tornado or hail, you can use this even to capture or kill your enemies.
Once again Chap Man started home. When he got inside the hogan, he was
told by the old man he was crazy or loco for doing the things that he
did against the advice of the old man. Once more the god said, “Do not
go to the mountain to the north. It is a dangerous place to go.” After
having breakfast of mush, which was not poisoned, he set out again. This
time Chap Man went to the north mountain. As he arrived there arose a
cloud about him which gave forth rain and lightning began to strike all
over and around him. The thunder turned into gods in the sky, and the
Thunder Gods came down to where Chap Man was. These places of the
encounters of Chap Man and his enemies are called the Wind Mountain,
nłč’izi·l, Thunder Mountain, ’i·ni’zi·l, Bear Mountain, šašzi·l, and Big
Snake Mountain, ƛ̓i·schozi·l. These are still dangerous mountains even
today, and all of these things are still there.

 Lightning was just one of the witch’s weapons. Each time Chap Man went
underneath a tree he said a word that protected him, just as the names
had before. The Thunder Gods said. “We are not doing this ourselves, but
it is your father-in-law who is making us do this. You have the power to
protect yourself and so we could not harm you. Your father-in-law is the
cause of this.” Chap Man’s only protection was the Wind who told him,
“That is your father-in-law (the bear, big snake or wind). This is his
secret name,” and the Chap Man called the name out and he was thus
saved. He was also told by the Holy Wind, “If you have intercourse with
the girl, the bear will eat you.” He said the same when Chap Man was to
meet the snake, thunder and tornado.

 The Wind would not have helped the Chap Man if he had disobeyed him.
There was a trick one had to play on the witch in order to get power
from the witch, which was in the baskets. The girl had breathed the
breath of her father and now had the power of the witch from her father.
The girl had the power of a witch and by having intercourse with the
girl, Chap Man would have lost his power to her. He, himself, would have
been weakened <span id="page_122">p. 122</span> so that the witch could
kill or get rid of him. Now the four days were up and Chap Man had much
power.

 After the gods had come down they told Chap Man, “There is a man you
should see over here. He has authority over all the people, for he knows
more than your father-in-law.” The father-in-law had the power of a
witch. The man the Thunder Gods meant for the Chap Man to see had more
power than the witch, but of a different type. The Thunder People said,
“Let us go over to this man and see about your father-in-law.”

 This man was Hippo and had knowledge for he knew the Good Way Story and
Songs, but the father-in-law had the power of a witch. The Thunder
People and Chap Man left and came to a lake which had water weeds upon
the water. The Thunder People blew at the edge of the water and it
opened up like a blanket on a sweat bath when it is thrown back. All of
the people went down into the water. Underneath the water on the floor
of the lake was a house, just like the house of Hippo.

 This god and Hippo Water God were the same. The trap door the Hippo had
taken before led out of the other lake and therefore the two houses were
the same. Chap Man said, “Hello, Hippo,” and received the reply, “Hello,
my grandson. What are you looking for?” Then he put his arm around the
Chap Man. The Hippo’s clothes were made out of hippo skin, but he was
standing up like a man with a man’s head and body.

 The Thunder People told Hippo about Chap Man’s travels, of his going
down the river, visiting the witch god’s house and where he was made a
son-in-law but not a real one, and all the rest of the story. “His
father-in-law told us to kill him, but we could not, so we brought him
to you,” ended the Thunder People. Hippo took out the string of
turquoise, white bead, jet and oyster shell and showed it to the Thunder
People. He said, “Why did you do this to the Chap Man? He has given me
this gift.” While this was going on the Sun had gone down and to his
home. Now it was evening.

 Inside Hippo’s house were his son, daughter and wife. The Hippo
introduced Chap Man and the Thunder People to his wife and family. All
of them were having a good time under the water. Hippo finally began to
tell Chap Boy about his father-in-law. “He had many sons-in-law and
killed them. He took away all of their stuff. That is how he gets all of
the turquoise, white bead, oyster shell and jet baskets. His real
daughter is his wife, too. That is how he tricks people. (“That is what
the Surface <span id="page_123">p. 123</span> People are doing now,
marrying their own relatives, committing murder and witchcraft,” F. G.)
The name of this lake where this took place is now called because of
this, That-is-Where-We-Slept-with-the-Thunder-and-the-Wind-People or
’i·’ni’ba’atk’eh ni’žé·’.

 These gods told Chap Man that his father-in-law could change into
anything. The father-in-law told the other gods to do such things and
that is why they had to do this. There were five different types of
baskets and only five, white bead, turquoise, oyster shell, jet and red
rock or stone, cétčí’i. All of these were underneath the rest of the
baskets in the witch’s hogan. “This witchcraft is going to die or get
sick and these baskets will then be mine. Go back to your father-in-law
and get the medicine out of the five baskets and he will get sick. When
the witch gets sick then he will give them to me to get him well, for I
am a medicine man.”

 These five baskets were used by the witch to cause witchcraft. The ones
on top of these five were his late sons-in-law’s. The baskets from these
men were of all kinds, white bead, turquoise, oyster shell and jet. When
the witch got sick, the witch would have to pay the five baskets to make
him well again. The Hippo said, “When he gets sick, he will give you the
baskets to cure him, I want those baskets.”

 When the Hippo was telling about what was to happen, morning had come.
Hippo told Chap Man, “Go back to the hogan and slip under the covers.
Have intercourse with the girl and then go to sleep.” The reason the
Wind told him not to have intercourse before was that he could then be
easily killed by the witch. If at the time the Chap Man did have
intercourse with the girl, he would have lost his strength. Thus, he
could not do this before the time was up and the Wind said it was all
right. The more times the father-in-law tried his power and failed, the
more power the Chap Man received. Now that he had this power he could
have intercourse with the girl and nothing could be done to him for he
still had more power than the witch. “If you marry, half of your body
will get stiff and paralyzed,” was told to him before. If he had had
intercourse with the girl, she could have drawn power from him.

 Now the witch had only one more means of killing the Chap Person, The
Hippo had said, “This last thing he is going to do against you is not
going to hurt you, but is going to turn against him, and he will get
sick from then on. This is the reason why all of the witch’s power will
be used up.” Before he left the home of the Hippo, he had been told, “He
will ask you if you can cure him. You say, ‘I know a little medicine.’ ”
Chap Man really knew no medicine at all.

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

 After thanking the Hippo and learning what he must do, he left the
Thunder People and went back to the hogan. He got under the cover and
had intercourse with the girl. After having intercourse, the girl fell
in love with Chap Man. The girl said she had loved him long before this.
Later, after the Dawn came, the witch came into the hogan. Chap Man told
the witch about where he had gone, but not what he had been told.

 The witch said, “I told you not to go over there; it is dangerous. You
are loco for you don’t do what I say.” The Chap Man thought of his corn.
Chap Man said goodbye to his wife and went to the beach. The turkey had
been near the beach taking care of the field. The corn was just right
for it was ripe now.

 He looked for his turkey and saw only some tracks. He followed the
tracks into the forest nearby. He followed the tracks as they led to a
lake and the tracks of his turkey went right into the water. The Chap
Man looked all around the banks and on top of the water but could not
find his turkey. He was so worried about his turkey that he was almost
ready to cry. He said out loud to the turkey wherever he was, “You will
be needed in the future by the Earth People for your feathers and your
meat will be used for food.”

 Chap Man went back to his cornfield at the beach. He began to gather
ears of corn and when he got as many as he could carry, he started home
with twelve ears of corn. When he arrived at the hogan, he gave them to
his new wife. She had never seen corn before and did not know what to do
with it, so he showed her how to prepare it. He put it in the boiling
water and cooked it for a little while. His wife took only little bites
at a time and said, “It tastes good, this corn.”

 While they were eating, the witch came in and was invited to eat. He,
too, took only a small bite and said, “Boy, this corn tastes good. I
know what this corn tastes like, it is like a young animal.” Chap Man
had never tasted meat. The witch said, “We will have some food that
tastes like this.” Little was done that day and evening soon came again.
The boy and girl slept together again and the {*sic*} in the morning the
witch said, “We have nothing to do; let us go hunting. We can go to the
mountain over there for there are lots of deer there.”

 When they got to the mountain there were not deer, but only deer manure
all around on the ground. The witch blew down the sun and the sky became
dark. The two built a fire and the witch said, “Let us camp here, it is
getting dark.” After awhile they made beds upon the ground. <span
id="page_125">p. 125</span> Once again the witch said, “There is
something dangerous here where we are camping. Do not go to sleep yet,
for there is something here, a ké didi·lyé. They lay down to go to sleep
and the witch started to snore, but he was just pretending. The Wind
whispered to the Chap Boy, “Get his shoes and put yours where his are
and exchange them. Put yours near his head, and his near your head.” The
Chap Boy did this and then pretended to sleep.

 It was almost morning again when the witch played his trick. The old
witch thought Chap Man was really asleep. He got up to see if he really
were, but Chap Man was also pretending. Suddenly the witch reached over
and got his own shoes, thinking that they were the Chap Man’s and put
them in the fire. The witch went to sleep and soon it was morning. He
got up, put on the moccasins and said, “Get up Chap Person, it is
morning. It is time to get up and go hunting.” The Chap Man got up,
looked around and said, “My moccasins are gone.” The witch looked around
and said, “I told you last night to watch your shoes.”

 The Chap Person kept looking around when he saw the witch had his
shoes. The witch looked at the moccasins he had on and saw they were the
Chap Person’s. He gave Chap Man the moccasins, but he wondered what had
happened. The witch had a special kind of moccasin to wear and that is
how they could tell. The witch was now to suffer from his own tricks. He
had placed small cactuses upon the ground so that the Chap Boy would
have to step on them because he thought that the moccasins would be
destroyed. The two started home with the witch having no shoes.

 The witch was having a tough time and could go no further. He told the
Chap Boy to go on and tell his daughter to come back and help him. She
had the power to do this, so off the Chap Boy went and finally arrived
at the hogan. Chap Man asked his wife, the daughter of the old man, to
go and tell her mother to go and see her husband for he needed help. The
Holy Wind told him to do this. If the daughter had gone up, he could
have had intercourse with his daughter for he had not had any for
several days. The Wind also knew it would be a chance to get the power
of the witch while both the old lady and old man were gone from the
hogans. The Chap Man had tricked the witch again.

 When the old woman got to the witch, they both became angry because of
the trick played on them. The old woman said, “The Chap Man sent me
over.” Angrily the witch replied, “I wanted my daughter to come over,
not you!” They argued about this for awhile and gave up and went home.
The old woman had brought moccasins to him so that he could walk back
now without being hurt.

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

 After the old lady had gone, the young girl had gone to the other
hogan. Inside, she took some kind of medicine out of a buckskin bag
which belonged to her father. Chap Man got the girl to go and get the
medicine for him, for she loved him more than her father and mother.
This medicine gave him power over anything. This was a
never-been-shot-buckskin bag which had a buckskin bag which had bear
claws hanging out of it. The girl dumped out the witchcraft stuff and
put in some dirt. She took the empty bag back to the hogan of her father
and took the medicine, taken from the bag, and gave it to Chap Man.

 The old man and woman, by now, had finally arrived back at camp. The
old man went to Chap Person and talked to him. As they talked, Chap Man
mentioned the powerful medicine he had. The witch said, “What gives you
your power?” The Chap Man answered, “This is my power and this is what
gives me my power.” It was a buckskin bag and he held it up and showed
it to the witch. There were no different kinds of medicine in the five
baskets of the witch. The only medicine he had was in one of the five
and the others were empty.

 The white bead basket held this bag which was witch’s power. These
baskets were used for praying for what the witch wanted. After he looked
the Chap Man’s bag over the witch said, “It is just like the medicine in
my bag.” Then he said, “I will go and get my bag.” The witch went and
brought it back and showed it to him. “The bags are the same so you must
have the same power as I do. That is the kind of a son-in-law I have
been looking for, one with the same power that I have. We will make
another expedition, another journey.” Next morning the two started out
again. They traveled for quite awhile and finally came to a cliff in a
canyon. They stayed there for some time.

 Looking around on the side of the rock wall the witch opened a door in
the rock. The Holy Wind said, “Watch closely how he is going to open the
door. Watch closely.” After a little while the door opened and the witch
went in. The hole or door could not be seen by anyone. When the witch
opened the door, Chap Man could see many animals: deer, mountain sheep
and antelope. In fact, all of the game animals in the world were there.
That is why the people could not find any game animals in the world when
they hunted. All have been hidden in the cave by the witch.

 The witch went inside the cave where the animals were, and left Chap
Person outside. The witch looked for the fattest animal and dragged it
outside. It was a deer. He dragged the deer alive all the way to the
<span id="page_127">p. 127</span> hogan. When the two arrived outside
the hogan, they killed the deer by smothering it with pollen. Chap Man
was shown how to cut and skin the deer. They put pollen all the way up
the arm, from the chin down to the belly and to the rear.

 After they finished they cut the deer up and the meat was divided
between Chap Person and the witch. Chap Man’s wife cut it up into
smaller pieces and told her husband to go to the corn field. He went
there and gathered all the corn and made it into a little bundle by
singing over it. The Holy Wind taught him to do this. He picked it up
and carried it home and spread it out to dry. Suddenly the witch took
sick. The witch had done very little around the hogan for a short while
before he became sick.

 He asked the Chap Man if he knew any prayers or songs or a medicine man
that could make him better. The Chap Person answered him, “I think I can
fix you up, but I have to go home and get my medicine bag.” He was just
saying this to fool the witch for he really knew nothing about medicine
to cure people. As he left to go he said, “I will be back in four days
and start the sing.” The witch answered that he would be ready. Chap Man
started back home to Pikes Peak. There were many people with the
features of ants living near his home. All around his home were all
colors of ants: yellow, white, red, blue and black.

 He told the ant people he knew no medicine and how he had to cure the
witch. The ants said they would teach him some strong medicine. These
ants had the power to do anything. There is now a sing called the Ant
Sing which these people taught Chap Man. They were people who had a song
to cure sickness. Chap Man studied for four days and learned all the
songs he could in this time. Finally they said, “We want corn pollen,
rock crystal and some other things for our telling you all these fine
songs.” He agreed with them and started back to the witch. This rock
crystal is used in the tobacco bag.

 When at last Chap Man arrived again at the coast, he started to sing
over the witch. Before he started he said, “I want a gift of a white,
blue, red, yellow and black baskets. I want all five of those baskets
you own over there.” That is why in a five-day sing the medicine man
uses five baskets. The witch was very sick and so he agreed to do these
things. The ceremony started and went on hour after hour until on the
fourth day the witch was almost well once more.

 The witch was walking around now, yet Chap Man had not finished <span
id="page_128">p. 128</span> for there was still one night’s singing to
do. On the night of the fifth night he was still singing. The girl, her
father, and her mother could not sleep until he had finished the
ceremony. Towards morning when all were asleep, Chap Man sneaked over to
the witch’s cave and opened the trap and let all the animals out.

 After he had left the three people heard him and got up. They looked
out and saw what he was doing and heard the animals come out of the
cave. The witch got up and ran over to the cave and tried to get all the
animals back in the hole, but could not. Chap Man had let them out
because all the game animals in the whole country had been caught and
kept by the witch in his cave. The man told the old woman to let the
animals smell her vagina. She ran out and caught a deer by making a
noise very loud at the deer, sh-sh. When the deer smelled her, it began
to jump around, hopping up and down just like he does today.

 The man reached out and caught a female deer and did the same to this
one as the woman had to the buck. The Deer Raiser did this for he knew
that the animals could be no longer kept as domesticated animals. Before
this, they were very tame, just like sheep are today. He became angry
and decided not to let anyone else have tame animals. This is how he
made them all wild. The old man and woman did this four times, yet all
the animals had smelled this strange odor, too.

 Deer Raiser is now the witch’s name because he had raised so many deer.
The reasan the old man and woman did this was so that all the game
animals would be much more difficult to catch. That is why there was
another name for the game when they came out of the cave,
dini’xažní·’a·’. The Ant Sing or Five or Nine Night Sing comes from this
feather story.

 There is still another sing that leads off from this feather story
which is called the Feather Sing. The above is a feather story, a branch
of the Good Way Story. Later the Hippo got his five presents and the Ant
People got their gifts. Deer-Raiser did not find out about the medicine
that had been stolen. From then on the two men were friendly. These gods
are still living there right now. That is the reason this area in
California is such a good place to raise fruits and food. If Deer-Raiser
had raised his animals or Chap Man raised his corn over here in Arizona,
this land would be prosperous instead of California.

<span id="page_113_note_1"></span>[1](#page_113_fr_1.md) Many would
classify this story as not belonging with the creation myth. Yet the
informant’s belief was that there are many stories proper which belong
in the creation myth and which have branches which come off from it.
These branches, which do not belong to the main theme of the myth, are
the origin myths of the ceremonies. There are as many beliefs as to the
correctness as to what is a true emergence myth as there are stories.
F. G. believes this story belongs in the creation myth and that this is
a Feather Story. From this branch come the ceremonials.

<span id="footnotes_page_119">p. 119</span>

<span id="page_119_note_1"></span>[1](#page_119_fr_1.md) When F. G. was a
young man, he looked at his mother-in-law and that is why his eyes are
going bad now. There are ways that one may look at his mother-in-law.
F. G. cured his mother-in-law when she was sick and so he could look at
her. This was just one of F. G.’s mothers-in-law for he had three wives.
You cannot sing over your wife or you are divorced. By singing you give
her power or a part of you and so you cannot marry her or it would be
like marrying your medicine bag. If you save your mother-in-law from
being killed by a horse or something similar you can look at your
mother-in-law. If you marry an older woman and then marry her daughter
then you can look at your mother-in-law, of course.
