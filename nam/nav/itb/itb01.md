## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

 Foremost among those whose help must be acknowledged is Frank
Goldtooth. This is really his book—his and the Navaho’s. His patience,
understanding and friendship will be long remembered. To his sons,
Teddy, Keith, Emerson and Herbert, go my thanks for their friendship and
for their cheerful interpreting for so many tedious hours. Knowledge
taken from many years experience on the reservation was generously given
to me by Ed Kerley and Ed Stocks. To my parents and to my brother and
his wife, Dr. and Mrs. Kenneth O. Fishler, I owe many thanks for their
help in so many ways. My wife has also helped in innumerable ways during
the various stages of preparation of the paper.

 I wish to express my appreciation to Professors E. Adamson Hoebel and
Elmer R. Smith for suggestions and criticisms of the manuscript. I am
indebted to Father Berard Haile who took time from his busy schedule to
work several hours on the majority of transcriptions of Navaho terms and
make other important suggestions. The phonetic system used by Father
Haile in *PRAYER STICK CUTTING in a Five Night Navaho Ceremonial of the
Male Branch of the Shootingway* is used herein.
