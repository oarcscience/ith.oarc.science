<span class="small">**NOTE:** The printed version of this book is in a
very basic typescript with all of the diacritical marks and IPA symbols
added by hand. This resulted in some symbols that were nearly illegible.
As I am not fluent in Navajo orthography, especially the more
complicated premodern systems, some of the transcriptions may be
slightly wrong. Also, there was a page of errata which has been silently
incorporated into this version along with a few other minor
typographical corrections.</span>
