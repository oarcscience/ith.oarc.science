\* **Note:** The copy from which this electronic version was produced
was a black and white copy of an original. Unfortunately, there are 15
full-color reproductions of sand-paintings in the original which could
not be taken from that copy. Also, there were captions to the text in
the margins throughout the book that are not reproduced in this version.
