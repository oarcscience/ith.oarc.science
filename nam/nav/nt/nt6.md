 Something was spread over it. It moved and became alive. It whimpered.
Woman-who-changes began to sing:—

<table data-align="center">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><span class="small">Changing Woman I am, I hear.<br />
In the center of my house behind the fire, I hear.<br />
Sitting on jewels spread wide, I hear.<br />
In a jet basket, in a jet house, there now it lies.<br />
Vegetation with its dew in it, it lies.<br />
Over there,<br />
It increases, not hurting the house now with it it lies, inside it lies.<br />
</span></td>

 Its feet were made of mirage. They say that because a horse’s feet have
stripes. Its gait was a rainbow, its bridle of sun strings. Its heart
was made of red stone. Its intestines were made of water of all kinds,
its tail of black rain. Its mane was a cloud with a little rain. Distant
lightning composed its ears. A big spreading twinkling star formed its
eye and striped its face. Its lower legs were white. At night it gives
light in front because its face was made of vegetation. Large beads
formed its lips; white shell, its teeth, so they would not wear out
quickly. A black flute was put into its mouth for a trumpet. Its belly
was made of dawn, one side white, one side black. That is why it is
called “half white.”

 A white-shell basket stood there. In it was the water of a mare’s
afterbirth. A turquoise basket stood there. It contained the water of
the afterbirth. An abalone basket full of the eggs of various birds
stood there. A jet basket with eggs stood there. The baskets stand for
quadrupeds, the eggs for birds. Now as Changing-woman began to sing the
animals came up to taste. The horse tasted twice; hence mares sometimes
give birth to twins. One ran back without tasting. Four times, he ran up
and back again. The last time he said, “Sh!” and did not taste. “She
will not give birth. Long-ears (Mule) she will be called,” said
Changing-Woman. The others tasted the eggs from the different places.
Hence there are many feathered people. Because they tasted the eggs in
the abalone and jet baskets many are black.
