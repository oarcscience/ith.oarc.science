 Times were hard in the world. Everywhere there were beings who were
eating people. One day a dark rain cloud was seen resting on the top of
*tc’ol’i*.<span id="page_148_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_148_note_2.md) The next
day the rain was seen to be falling nearly to the middle of the
mountain. The third day it reached well beyond the middle and the fourth
day the rain enveloped the entire mountain and was falling at its base.

 First Man, observing this from the top of *dzıłna’odıłi*, addressing
First Woman said, “Old woman, four days ago there was a dark rain cloud
on the top of *tc’ol’i* and now the entire mountain is covered with
rain. Something unusual has happened. I am going to see what it is.”
“There are things to be feared there. The devouring ones are many. Why
do you go?” First Woman replied. “Nothing untoward will happen,” First
Man said and started away on a run. When he had run some distance he
began to sing:—

Having arrived at the base of the mountain with this song he climbed the
mountain with a similar one, but with the refrain, “I am climbing.” When
he was ready to return the song had for a refrain, “I start home.” On
the way back he sang a similar song saying, “I am traveling home.” This
was followed by one with the refrain, “I have returned.” The final song
has for a refrain, “I sit down again.”<span
id="page_148_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_148_note_3.md)

 When First Man came to the top of the mountain he heard a baby crying.
The lightning striking all about and murk caused by the hard rain <span
id="page_149">p. 149</span> made it difficult to see anything. He
discovered the baby lying there with its head toward the west and its
feet toward the east. Its cradle consisted of two short rainbows which
lay longitudinally under it. Crosswise, at its chest and feet, lay red
rays of the rising sun. Arched over its face was a rainbow. The baby was
wrapped in four blankets; dark cloud, blue cloud, yellow cloud, and
white cloud. Along either side was a row of loops made of lightning and
through these a sunbeam was laced back and forth.

 First Man, not knowing how to undo the fastenings, took up the baby,
cradle and all, and started home with the songs mentioned above. When he
arrived he called out. “Old woman, it is a baby, I found it there where
it is black night with rain clouds.”<span
id="page_149_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_149_note_1.md) “Ee,” First Woman
exclaimed. They heard immediately *xawu‛*, *xawu‛*, *xawu‛*, the call of
Mirage *xactc’εxti*. This was followed by *xuuuxu Xuuuxu Xuuuxu wuwuoo*,
the cry of his companion Mirage *xactc’εoγan*. The two gods came in with
*xactc’εxti* in the lead who clapped his hand over his mouth and then
struck them together, crying, “Something great has happened, my
grandchildren. This is the one we have been talking about. Hereafter her
mind will be the ruling power.” He put the baby on the ground back of
the fire, pulled the string and the lacing came free in both directions.

 “The cradle shall be like this. Thin pieces of wood shall be placed
underneath. There will be a row of loops on either side made of string.
The bark of the cliff rose, shredded and rubbed fine will be used under
the child for a bed.”<span
id="page_149_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_149_note_2.md) It was a girl.

 “Ee,” said First Woman, “*citc’ε* (my daughter, woman speaking) she
shall be.” First Man said, “She will be *sitsi’* ” (my daughter, man
speaking).

 A day was the same as a year. The second day the baby sat up and when
two days had passed she looked around. She was then dressed.

 When she was two days old she walked and when three days had passed she
danced. Four days after she was found she ran some distance. When the
fifth and sixth days had passed First Woman walked with her, calling her
daughter. The seventh, eighth, and ninth days passed and on the tenth at
dawn she was named *yołkai esdzą*, “White Shell Woman.” Eleven days
passed and on the thirteenth day, when the sun reached the exact place
in the sky where it was when the girl was found, she was discovered to
be menstruating.

 “Mother, something is passing from me,” she said. “That, my daughter,
is called *tsidεsdla*.<span
id="page_150_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_150_note_2.md) A girl will reach
puberty at thirteen years of age.” When all had passed she washed in a
white shell basket, in a turquoise basket, in an abalone shell basket,
and finally in a jet basket.

 She was dressed and then a bed was spread for her with a white buckskin
at the bottom, and on it a blanket of white cotton, third, an
embroidered black one, and fourth, a white coyote skin blanket. The girl
lay face down on this bed stretched out.<span
id="page_151_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_151_note_1.md)

 “From here one runs in a sunwise circuit and then one should jump over
to the place behind the fire. There you have finished running. With soft
goods you finish running, my daughter. With white shell you finish
running, my daughter.” First Woman said. “When three days have passed.”
“Let all the holy ones come where we are living,” said First Man. “You
are appointed the leaders, Mirage *xactc’εłti* and Mirage
*xactc’εoγan*.”

 He drew twelve lines one after the other on *dziłna’odiłi*. “There,” he
said, “will be house spread out, house iridescent.” When the sun set
they come together at the house called spread out and iridescent. First,
came the Mirage *xactc’εłti* who formed a line at the back and then
Mirage *xactc’εoγan* made the second line. Third were *xactc’εłti*
people and fourth *xactc’εoγan*; fifth were the holy people who live in
mountains; sixth were the hunchback people, seventh were *xactc’εłti*
people, eighth grasshopper people.

 “Now it will be,” he said. Then it happened; the curtain was raised and
someone said, “Why were we not notified?” “Your fee will be provided,”
he replied. “They will make a long line,” he said. White shells came in,
one after the other, in pairs. Turquoise came in one after the other, in
pairs. Rings of haliotis came in one after the other, in pairs. Woven
beads came in one after the other, in pairs. Then red shells were, and
braided beads, white coyote blankets, black fabrics, figured fabric.
These formed twelve lines one behind the other.

 “Now we will begin *xojondji*,” he said and drew out a sack of pollen.
“Paint the house with it,” he directed. Then in a sunwise circuit four
timbers, one after the other, were made yellow with pollen. He called,
“*wεxε*,” to Mirage *xactc’εłti*, being in the last row. Then their
leader began to sing. He intoned as follows:—

 When these two songs had been sung the one over whom they were singing
said: “Why do you sing thus. Two men are lacking.” The men in the twelve
lines said they did not know who were lacking. “There is something you
do not know about. With what shall I live forever? With what shall I
have good fortune?”

 “Very well,” he replied. They added these two, long life and good
fortune to the others. Then they began to sing. They sang twelve and
then put two songs on top, making fourteen. By that time, day was
breaking and grasshoppers began to sing. A woman’s song was heard and
when it was finished someone put a head in and said, “Why didn’t you
invite us?” “Your fee will provided,” First Man replied. They found it
was Dawn who had done this. Then they began to sing.

 There were six songs all alike which are called dawn songs.

 When four days had passed the girl said to her mother, “Something is
flowing from me again, mother.” “That is called *kindzisda’* ” her <span
id="page_153">p. 153</span> mother replied. They did the same way again.
The holy people came from both sides. “We shall never be seen after
this,” *xactc’εłti* said. They departed in all directions. *xactc’εγan*
spoke: “If anyone says ‘I saw *xactc’εγałti* I say he shall be
killed.’ ” Sun spoke. “They shall not see me, because it would be bad
luck if they saw me.” On account of this the assemblage was dismissed.
When one day had passed she said, “Something flows from me again.” “That
is called *tcedji’na’*. It ceases after four days have passed. Because
of that the flowing of a menstruating woman will cease in four days.
She, menstruating, was lustful. She went to the top of a hill called
*tondiłkons*<span id="page_153_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_153_note_1.md) and
spread her thighs toward the rising sun so that the rays might enter
her. Later in the day when the Sun reached the center of the sky where
he feeds his horse at noon, she went where the dripping water falls and
again spread her thighs to let the water drop into her crotch. She did
this repeatedly. Afterward she and her mother went down the mountain
toward the south to a place where a grass (*Sporobolus cryptandrus*) was
growing. Before they had finished preparing the seed they started back,
leaving some still in a heap. It was early noon when they hastily
returned.

 “I will run back for that remaining in the pile,” the girl said. “No,
do not do that, my daughter.” First Woman replied. “I will run and be
back quickly,” the girl said. “There are dangers there, many of those
who eat people run about,” her mother warned her. “No, mother, I will
come back quickly with the threshed seeds. I also am not entirely
ignorant.<span id="page_153_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_153_note_2.md) I will be
wary,” the girl said. “All right then, go on, daughter,” her mother
replied.

 The girl went for the seed and when she had threshed it all and was
hanging her load she was surprised to find a white horse standing there.
The bridle of the horse was white. The moccasins of the rider and all
his clothing were white. The horse was standing on the air some two feet
above the ground. The rider addressed her saying, “You will not
accomplish it. Over there, when I rise spread out your thighs toward me.
When I come up to the summit of the sky and arrive at (?) spread your
legs at *tondilkons* that the water may drop into your crotch. You will
accomplish nothing by those means. Let your father make a brush house
toward the east and see what will happen.” She was surprised to find it
was Sun who had done this. While her head was turned he vanished.

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

 She walked back and when she had returned she said, “Mother, I saw
something. He was entirely white and his horse was all white. ‘You will
accomplish nothing that way. You have been spreading your thighs toward
me there where I rise. When I have reached the middle of the sky where I
lunch you spread your legs under the dripping water,’ he said to me,”
she said. “Have you really been doing that?” First Woman asked. “I
really did that,” she replied.

 First Man came home. “It seems your daughter saw someone,” First Woman
said to him. “The one she saw was dressed entirely in white, sitting a
horse standing right up here, not on the ground, so your daughter said.
‘You will accomplish nothing the way you are doing. You have been
spreading your thighs toward me here where I come up. When I come to the
middle of the sky you spread your thighs under the dripping water,’ he
said to her. ‘I really do that,’ your daughter says. ‘Let your father
build a brush shelter to the east before the door of the hogan. Let him
rake up the ground. Let him put the chips in a pile. Put some boiled
rush grass seeds in a vessel.’ This is what your daughter says.” “The
holy ones have all gone away. They said no one would see them again,” he
replied. “Oh you are saying that for some reason,” she retorted. “Build
a brush shelter there, Old Man.”

 He built a brush shelter and swept the ground in front of the hogan
door. He also made a pile of the bits of wood which were lying about.
The sun set and it grew dark. He spread down a white blanket and put
down a vessel of boiled food on one side of it. The girl sat on the
right side and First Man on the left. The cooked food stood there in a
vessel. When it was quite dark<span
id="page_154_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_154_note_1.md) First Man went away, but
*yołgaiałεd* passed the night there. When it was daylight footprints
were seen from the doorway on the right side. One (vessel) of the cooked
food was gone. First Man returned saying, “How is it, my daughter?”
“Father, there is one footprint on the right side in the doorway. The
one vessel of the cooked food is gone too.” When it was getting dark
toward the east they two sat there again until it was quite dark. First
Man came back saying, “How is it, my daughter? Nobody came. I said you
were lying.” “Just as it was light I perceived someone touched me. There
are two footprints by the doorway and one dish of the cooked food is
gone.”

 It was dark the second time and the two of them sat there again. When
it was daylight First Man came back again. “How is it, my daughter?” he
said. “I told you no one would come. I said you were lying. Why should
the holy ones come when we live so poorly.” “Oh, <span id="page_155">p.
155</span> do not say that,” she said. “Now let us look,” First Woman
said. The food was gone from a dish on the east side. There were
footprints. “Go look, father,” she said. “I felt him go away on this
side at daybreak.”

 When it was night again they two sat there. At midnight First Man went
away, He came back in the morning. The food was gone from the north side
and there were four footprints. “At dawn someone left me, I didn’t see
him but I woke up my crotch being wet.”

 On account of this the Navajo do not touch a woman for four nights
after they are married. On the fourth night they have intercourse.

 Four days passed. “Mother, at dawn something here was pulsating,” she
said. “Oh, daughter, you are pregnant. It is the moving of a baby you
mean. That is the result of your having intercourse,” her mother said to
her. It was at dawn on the fourth day that the baby moved. The days were
equivalent to months and because of that the baby moves after four
months. Nine days after they had had intercourse the children (twins)
were born. Just one day after their birth they two sat up. For other
children it will be a year. After two days the two walked about. It will
be two years for ordinary children. Ten days after they were born First
Man made arrows for them and they hunted birds. Fifteen days after they
were born they went to the summit of *dzıłna’odıłi*. When they were
strolling about Large-fly came to them and said, “My son’s sons, why are
you walking here? You were not born for anything connected with this
place.” He knows everything about this wide world of ours and he told
them about it. “You two should go to your father. That one, the sun who
moves there, is your father. Ask your mother four times who your father
is and then tell her you are going to see your father. Speak to her
once.”

 They ran back and asked, “Who is our father?” “Oh you are everybody’s
kin,” she replied. After a while they said again, “Who is our father?”
“Barrel-cactus was your father.<span
id="page_155_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_155_note_1.md) That is why your heads
are bushy.” When some time had again passed they asked the same question
again. “Sitting-cactus was your father.” When some time had passed again
they said, “What were you saying? You are everybody’s kin. You had no
father. Barrel-cactus was your father. He had no father. Sitting-cactus
was your father. He had no father. Now we will start away to visit our
father. Sun is our father. Mother, grandmother, grandfather, we will
come back to you in four days.” They started away. When they were a
short distance in front of the door they discovered a <span
id="page_156">p. 156</span> white rainbow. They stepped on that and
traveled with it. When they arrived their bodies were moulded, their
faces made white. “Now they will be given names,” he said. They invited
Mirage *xactc’εłti*, Mirage *xactc’εoγan*, *xactc’εłti*, *xactc’’εoγan*,
and, from the place called black hole in the rock, they invited
*xactc’εcjinnε*. Sun came down. The two who were to be named stood in
front. The elder he addressed as *naiyε’nezγani* and the younger as
*tobadj’ictcini*. “Now make names for them,” he said to them.

 “Now you give a name,” he said to *xactc’εcjinnε*. “What you do he
doesn’t know (?),” he said. “He killed all the monsters. The elder will
be named *naiyε’nezγani*, the second because of what his mother did will
be named *tobadj’ictcini*. Where will you two go?” he asked them. With a
coal of the dark sky he made him black. With white clay he drew signs of
a bow on him. This will ward off danger. He made *tobadj’ictcini* red
with red earth and put on wide hair frame signs with white clay. By
means of these they will be protected. “They will go where the rivers
join,” Sun said. “They will live at the center of the earth where there
is a meadow. First Man and First Woman will live here where I rise,
beyond where it is called ‘narrow water’. *yołgaiesdzan* will go over
here where I sit. She will live there.” Sun said this and added, “She
will take everything with her and be accompanied by all the people. She
will give her attention to her children and to providing their food. It
will be that way. Everywhere I go over the earth she will have charge of
female rain. I myself will control the male rain. She will be in control
of vegetation everywhere for the benefit of the people of the earth.”

 Water Coyote ran about over there on the other side. He stepped out
first. After him came First Man and then First Woman. After came First
Warrior.<span id="page_156_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_156_note_1.md) They
started toward the east and First Woman began to speak, saying bad
things. “When I think of anything, something bad will happen. There will
be coughs when I think of something. I will cause different things by
thinking badly. Coyote will know about it.” She always was saying bad
things.

 “First Woman, you shall not talk. You shall not live. We have decided
upon that,” said Mirage *xactc’εłti* and Mirage *xactc’εoγan*. “You must
not talk for we will know about it,” *xactc’εłti* said.

 “Now get ready *yołgaiesdzan*.” They decorated her and she started
away, accompanied by her twelve attendants. In front, went the males and
behind them the females. Ahead of her was male rain and <span
id="page_157">p. 157</span> behind her female rain; in front dark cloud
and behind dark mist; before her yellow cloud and behind her yellow
mist; before her white cloud and behind her white mist.

 She was decorated with all kinds of herbage and flowers wherever they
grow. She went away with a white shell basket, a turquoise basket, an
abalone basket, and jet basket. She rose up with everything. She went
with them to the place called black water and is living there now.

 When she had arrived she thought horses should exist for people.

 I am *yołgaiesdzan*. I am thinking of clothing spread out on there. A
white shell horse lies in a white shell basket. I am thinking about.
They lie in the pollen of flowers. Those who come to me will increase.
Those that will not die lie in it.
