# A TALE OF KININAÉKAI: <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) ACCOUNTING FOR THE ORIGIN OF CERTAIN PRAYERS AND SONGS OF THE NIGHT CHANT.

### INTRODUCTION.

In my work entitled "The Night Chant, A Navaho Ceremony," <span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md) I give translations of four myths (or, more
properly, of three myths and a variant) that belong to the ceremony
described. These may be called the great or fundamental myths of the
ceremony; but, in addition, there is a great number of minor myths,
accounting for the origin of certain minor rites, and of different
groups of songs of sequence and other matters. We may never reasonably
hope for the collection and translation of all these myths.

The following tale accounts for the origin of one of these groups of
songs, namely the Tsénit*s*i*h*o*g*an Bigï'n or songs of the Red Rock
House, and perhaps for the origin of some of the ritual observances.

In "The Night Chant" I say, when describing the rites of the second day:
"When the party returns to the medicine lodge, the patient sits in the
west, for he has still further treatment to undergo. \* \* \* The
chanter applies pollen to the essential parts of the patient, puts some
in his or her mouth, takes a pinch of it on his own tongue, and applies
a little of it to the top of his own head. These applications of pollen
are all timed to coincide with certain words of the accompanying song."
Song F that follows is what may be called a pollen song, for it is sung
when pollen is applied. I explain, in notes, where and when different
applications of pollen are made as the singing progresses. I cannot say
if there are other pollen songs; but probably there are.

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

### THE LEGEND.

In the ancient days, there were four songs which you had to sing if you
would enter the White House. <span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#fn_3.md) The first
was sung when you were ascending the cliff; the second, when you entered
the first doorway; the third, when you walked around inside the house;
and the fourth, when you were prepared to leave. You climbed up from the
ground to the house on a rainbow. All this was in the old days. You
cannot climb that way now. In those days, *H*ayo*l*ká*l* A*s*kí, Dawn
Boy, went there on a rainbow.

In the ancient days, there lived in this house a chief of the house.
There were four rooms and four doors, and there were sentinels at each
door. At the first door there were two big lightnings, one on each side;
at the second door there were two bears; at the third door there were
two red-headed snakes, which could charm you from afar, before you got
near them; and at the fourth door there were two rattlesnakes.

Of course few people ever visited the place, for if the visitor were not
a holy one some of these sentinels would surely kill him. They were
vigilant. The chief of the house and his subordinates had these songs,
by the power of which they could enter and quiet the sentinels, who
always showed signs of anger when any one approached them.

Dawn Boy got leave from *H*ast*s*éyal*t*i <span
id="fr_4"></span>[4](#fn_4.md) to go to White House. *H*ast*s*éyal*t*i
instructed him how to get there, taught him the prayers and songs he
must know, and told him what sacrifices he must make. These must include
fragments of turquoise, white shell, haliotis, and cannel-coal, besides
dest*s*í corn-pollen and larkspur pollen, and were to be tied up in
different bags before he started. "When you get into the plain, as far
off as the people of White House can see you, begin to sing one of these
songs and a rainbow will form on which you may walk," said
*H*ast*s*éyal*t*i.

Dawn Boy then set forth on his journey. When he got to Dzi*l*danístíni,
or Reclining Mountain, he got his first view of the White House, and
there he began to sing. Reclining Mountain is,

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

today, far from White House; you cannot see one place from the other;
but in the ancient days the world was smaller than it is now, and the
people of whom I speak were holy ones. When he had finished the song a
rainbow appeared, as *H*ast*s*éyal*t*i had promised, spanning the land
from Reclining Mountain to White House. As he walked on the rainbow, a
great wind began to blow, raising a dust that blinded the sentinels at
White House and prevented them from seeing Dawn Boy when he entered.

There was a black kethawn <span id="fr_5"></span>[5](#fn_5.md) at each side
of the door and a curtain hung in the doorway. When he entered the
house, he walked on a trail of daylight and he sprinkled pollen on the
trail. The people within became aware of the presence of a stranger and
looked up. *H*ast*s*éyal*t*i and *H*ast*s*é*h*o*g*an, the Talking God
and the House God, who were the chief gods there, looked angrily at him,
and one said: "Who is this stranger that enters our house unbidden? Is
he one of the People on the Earth? <span id="fr_6"></span>[6](#fn_6.md)
Such have never dared to enter this place before." Dawn Boy replied: "It
is not for nothing that I come here. See! I have brought gifts for you.
I hope to find friends here." Then he showed the precious things he had
brought and sang this song:

### SONG A. (Free translation.)

1\. Where my kindred dwell, there I wander.  
2. Child of the White Corn am I, there I wander.  
3. The Red Rock House, there I wander.  
4. Where dark kethawns are at the doorway, there I wander.  
5. With the pollen of dawn upon my trail. There I wander.  
6. At the yuni, the striped cotton hangs with pollen. There I wander.  
7. Going around with it. There I wander.  
8. Taking another, I depart with it. With it I wander.  
9. In the house of long life, there I wander.  
10. In the house of happiness, there I wander.  
11. Beauty before me, with it I wander.  
12. Beauty behind me, with it I wander.

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

13\. Beauty below me, with it I wander.  
14. Beauty above me, with it I wander.  
15. Beauty all around me, with it I wander.  
16. In old age traveling, with it I wander.  
17. On the beautiful trail I am, <span id="fr_7"></span>[7](#fn_7.md) with
it I wander.

Then he gave them the sacred things he had brought with him, and
*H*ast*s*éyal*t*i said it was well, that he was welcome to remain, and
they asked him what he wanted. "I want many things," he replied. "I have
brought you pieces of precious stones and shells; these I wish wrought
into beads and strung into ornaments, like those I see hanging
abundantly on your walls. I wish domestic animals of all kinds, corn of
all kinds, and plants of all kinds. I wish good and beautiful black
clouds, good and beautiful thunder storms, good and beautiful gentle
showers, and good and beautiful black fogs."

The chiefs thanked him for his gifts, and asked him whose song it was
that enabled him to come to White House,--who it was that taught it to
him. But he had been warned by his informant not to reveal this, so he
answered: "No one told me; I composed my songs myself. They are my own
songs." "What is your name?" they asked. "I am *H*ayo*l*ká*l*. A*s*kí,
Dawn Boy," he replied. "It is well," said the holy ones. "Since you know
our songs you are welcome to come here; but rarely does any one visit
us, for there are but two outside of our dwelling who know our songs.
One is *H*ast*s*éyal*t*i of Tsé\`intyel, <span
id="fr_8"></span>[8](#fn_8.md) in this cañon, and the other is
*H*ast*s*éyal*t*i of Tse\`ya*h*ódï*l*yï*l* <span
id="fr_9"></span>[9](#fn_9.md) in Tse\`gíhe. <span
id="fr_10"></span>[10](#fn_10.md)

Then *H*ast*s*é*h*o*g*an sent for a sacred buckskin, and one son and one
daughter of each of the two gods, *H*astséyal*t*i and
*H*ast*s*é*h*o*g*an spread the skin for Dawn Boy to stand on. Thus do we
now, as the gods did then. <span id="fr_11"></span>[11](#fn_11.md) As he
stood, *H*ast*s*é*h*o*g*an taught Dawn Boy the White House prayer, as
follows:

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

When they had done, *H*ast*s*é*h*o*g*an said: "You have learned the
prayer well; you have said it properly and you have done right in all
things. Now you shall have what you want." They gave him good and
beautiful soft goods of all kinds, all kinds of good and beautiful
domestic animals, wild animals, corn of all colors, black clouds, black
mists, male rains, female rains, lightning, plants, and pollen.

After he had said the six prayers (or six parts of a prayer) as he bad
been taught, he prayed in his mind that on his homeward journey he might
have good pollen above him, below him, before him, behind him, and all
around him; that he might have good pollen in his voice. The holy ones
said: "We promise you all this. Now you may go."

As he started he began to sing this song:

### SONG B. (Free translation.)

1\. To the house of my kindred, there I return.  
2. Child of the yellow corn am I.  
3. To the Red Rock House, there I return.

15. Beauty all around me, with it I return.  
16. Now in old age wandering, I return.  
17. Now on the trail of beauty, I am. There I return.

He continued to sing this until he got about 400 paces from White House,
when he crossed a hill and began to sing the following song:

(The rest as in I, except that 14 and 15 and also 16 and 17 change
places.)

By the time he had finished this song he was back at Dzi*l*danístíni,
whence be started on his quest and from which he could see Depéntsa and
the hills around Tse\`gíhi. Then he began to think about his home, and
he sang another song.

### SONG D (Free translation.)

There it looms up, it looms up, it looms up, it looms up. (Prelude.)  
1. The mountain of emergence looms up.  
2. The mountain of dawn looms up.

5. The mountain of rain looms up.  
6. The mountain of pollen looms up.  
7. The mountain of grasshoppers looms up.  
8. The field of my kindred looms up.

He thought it was yet a long way to his home, so he sat down to eat some
food he had brought with him. Then he sang another song, one of the
Be*z*í*n*yasin or Food Songs, as follows:

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

### SONG E. (Free translation.)

Ína hwié! my child, I am about to eat. (Three times. Prelude.)

When he had finished his meal, he sang another of the Be*z*í*n*yasin, a
song sung in these days when pollen was administered in the rites.

Dawn Boy how crossed a valley to Tse\`gíhi, and as he crossed it he sang
another song the burden of which was "Hozógo nasá, in a beautiful manner
I walk."

When he got to the edge of the cañon he looked across it, and there he
saw his mother, his father, his sisters, his brothers, and

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

all his relations. They espied him from afar at the same time, and they
said: "Hither comes our elder brother. Hither comes our younger
brother," etc., and *H*ast*s*éyal*t*i, who first taught him the songs
and sent him forth on his journey, said: "*S*itsówe nada\`, my grandson
has returned home." Then his father, who had gone inside to spread a
sacred buckskin for him, came out again.

Dawn Boy sang a song when he was at the door of the house, the burden of
which was, "*S*a*g*án *s*i níya, I approach my home," and after he
entered he sang "*S*a*g*án *s*i nidá, in my house I sit down."

Hast*s*éyal*t*i entered the house after him, and then all the neighbors
crowded in and sat down. The old man and the old woman said: "My son,
tell us your story;" and *H*ast*s*éyal*t*i said: "Tell us the story of
the holy place you visited, where no stranger ever dared to venture
before." Dawn Boy bade them sing a song and promised when they were done
singing he would tell his story. The father then sang a song the burden
of which was "Diiá *t*i *s*ï*l*naho*l*ne se, this person will tell me a
story."

When the song was finished, Dawn Boy said: "My grandfather, my mother,
my father (etc.), what you said was true. It was in truth a holy place
that I visited. I did not at first believe that it was such; but now I
know that it is.", Then he related all his adventures as they have been
already told.  
After he had related his story, they made preparations to have a
ceremony for him. They made him stand on a sacred buckskin, even as the
people of White House had done. As he stood on the footprints, drawn in
pollen, he said this prayer:

### PRAYER No. 2. (Free translation.)

1\. Dawn Boy am I, I say.  
2. Soft goods of all kinds, my moccasins, I say.

of the Night Chant, on the last morning when the great nocturnal dance
is finished.

yellow sandstone. The Navahoes do not think this the result of a mere
whim, but that it is intentional and symbolic. White is the color of he
east in Navaho symbolism, and they suppose the upper story was sacred to
*H*ast*s*éyalti, or Talking God, who was a god of dawn and of the east.
Yellow is the symbolic color of the west, and they suppose the lower
story belonged to *H*ast*s*é*h*o*g*an, or House God, who was a god of
the west and of the evening twilight.

Prayer appear to be modern growths, even if the whole cultus and myth is
not modern. Yet something may be said to the contrary. The word which I
translate horses (*L*i*n*) refers also to any sort of a pet or domestic
animal, and the word for sheep (Debé) originally meant the wild Rocky
Mountain sheep or bighorn. It is now employed to designate the domestic
sheep, while the bighorn is now called tsé\`*t*a debé or
sheep-among-rocks.
