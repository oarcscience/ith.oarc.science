# THE STORY OF BEKOT*S*IDI.

Békot*s*ïdi and Sun Bearer (T*s*í*n*ihanoai) made all the animals while
they were sitting together in the same room,-- Békot*s*ïdi in the north,
T*s*í*n*ihanoai in the south. While the former was making a horse, the
latter was making an antelope, and this is why the antelope is so much
like a horse. It has a mane and no small back toes as the deer has.

Both of the gods sang while they were at work, and this was the song
that Békot*s*ïdi sang to bless all that he was making. It was the first
song which he sang at this work.

1\. Now Békotsïdi, that am I. For them I make.  
2. Now child of Day Bearer am I. For them I make.  
3. Now Day Bearer's beam of blue. For them I make.  
4. Shines on my feet and your feet too. For them I make.  
5. Horses of all kinds now increase. For them I make.  
6. At my finger's tips and yours. For them I make.  
7. Beasts of all kinds now increase. For them I make.  
S. The bluebirds now increase. For them I make.  
9. Soft goods of all kinds now increase. For them I make.  
10. Now with the pollen they increase. For them I make.  
11. Increasing now, they will last forever. For them I make.  
12. In old age wandering on the trail of beauty. For them I make.  
13. To form them fair, for them I labor. For them I make.

After he had made the animals, he sang another song the refrain of which
is "Ka*t* *h*ad*z*í*d*ila\`, now they are made." As the animals began to
breed, he sang another song appropriate to this, and when they were
multiplying abundantly, he sang a fourth song, the burden of which was
Keanádild*z*ï*s*i, which means, they are multiplying.

While Day Bearer was making the horse and domestic sheep, Békot*s*ïdi
was making antelope and bighorn. While Day Bearer was making a goat,
Békot*s*ïdi was making a cow. While the former was making a deer, the
latter was making an elk. Then Day Bearer began to make a mule and
Bekotsidi began to make a donkey, and the former said: "I shall stop
with this; I shall make no more." But Békot*s*ïdi said, "I shall
continue my work." Then he made the jack-rabbit, the small rabbit, the
prairie-dog, the wood-rat, and many more animals. <span

No pictures were drawn of Bekotsidi and no one masquerades in his form.
His appearance is not known. <span id="fr_38"></span>[26](#fn_27.md)

Four songs and no more belong to this tale. If you want a fine horse,
sing the second and third songs, say a prayer, and you will get the
horse. In your prayer specify the color and kind of a horse you desire.,
It will come to you from the house of Day Bearer.

The name Békot*s*ïdi signifies "He tries to catch it." He got his name
while he was out hunting. An indecent story is told to account for this.

The first iron-gray horse was made of turquoise, the first red (sorrel)
horse of red stone (carnelian ?), the first black horse of cannel coal,
the first white horse of white shell, and the first piebald horse of
haliotis shell. So horses are now, according to their color, called
after the different substances of which the first horses were made, Thus
the Navahoes speak of do*l*ï'*z*i *l*i*n*. (turquoise or gray horse),
bást*s*ïli *l*i*n* (red stone or sorrel hors e), bászïni *l*i*n* (cannel
coal or black horse), yo*l*kaí *l*i*n* (haliotis or spotted horse).

The hoofs of the first horse were made of tse\`*h*adá*h*onige, or mirage
stone, a stone on which paints are ground. Such stones

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

are added to earth from six sacred mountains to form their most potent
medicine. A shaman will not treat a diseased horse without this. It is
used, too, when they pray for increase of stock and increase of wealth.

know if Bekotsidi made snakes and fish.

uncertain about this word. An informant has suggested dantingo, "several
