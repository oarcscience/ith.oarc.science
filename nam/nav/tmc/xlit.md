# Notes on the System of Transliteration in this Document

In 1887, at the time that Washington Matthews published 'The Mountain
Chant' (TMC) Navajo did not have a standardized orthography. The science
of linguistics was in its infancy. Even the scholarly community did not
have a good understanding of the phonetics of Native American languages.
Therefore, TMC uses a unique system of transcription of Navajo, which
only appears in this document. To preserve the public domain status of
the text I have reproduced as closely as possible Matthews'
transcription from the original document. Unfortunately this means that
the Navajo words and passages in this text will be difficult to
recognize for modern readers of the Navajo language.

The vowels (if you ignore Matthews often inconsistent use of diacritics)
are transcribed as in the modern standard orthography and pronounced as
in most Romance languages. The superscript <sup>n</sup> in TMC
transliteration indicates the nasalized version of the preceeding vowel.

The transcription of Navajo consonants present the most problems; there
is a whole set of glottalized consonants which Matthews didn't
transcribe. To make matters worse, Matthews didn't transcribe the
difference between voiced and voiceless 'l'. So there is not a
one-to-one correspondence between the TMC transliteration and modern
orthography.

The chart below shows how the TMC transliteration of consonants relates
to modern Navajo orthography and gives a simplified guide to the
pronunciation. This chart uses Unicode character entities to indicate
the voiceless 'l'. This will not be visible unless your browser handles
Unicode properly.
