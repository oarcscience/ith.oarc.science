### WHERE THE FIGHT WAS

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

    In the place where the fight was  
Across the river,  
In the place where the fight was  
Across the river:  
A heavy load for a woman  
To lift in her blanket,  
A heavy load for a woman  
To carry on her shoulder.  
In the place where the fight was  
Across the river,  
In the place where the fight was  
Across the river:  
The women go wailing  
To gather the wounded,  
The women go wailing  
To pick up the dead.
