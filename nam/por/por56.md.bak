#### SONG OF THE FULL CATCH

    Here's good wind, here's sweet wind,  
Here's good wind and my woman calls me!  
Straight she stands there by the pine-tree,  
Faithful waits she by the cedar,  
She will smile and reach her hands  
When she sees my thousand salmon!  
Here's good wind and my woman calls me.

    Here's clear water, here's swift water,  
Here's bright water and my woman waits me!  
She will call me from the sea's mouth—  
Sweet her pine-bed when the morning  
Lights my canoe and the river ends!  
Here's good wind, here's swift water,  
Strong as love when my woman calls me!
