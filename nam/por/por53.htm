N&#8217;-n&#8217;-n&#8217;-n&#8217;-m!<br> Ai-i-he-i&#8212;ah-o-he-a-i-ne&#8212;<br> Swing my chiefling fragrantly<br> On the cedar-branch.<br> Cedar, Cedar, tenderly<br> Sway to the singing wind.<br> Bright flying Wind with song in thy white throat,<br> And light in thy wide sea-eyes,<br> The sky's blue feathers on thy wing&#8212;<br> Oh blow, blow, gently, softly, Wind,<br> Rock my chiefling, Wind,<br> In his little woven cradle.<br> In the dusk my fingers still threaded,<br> Needing no light.</div></p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">I remember my mother sat near me often, watching;<br> Sometimes weeping. Yes, she wept;<br> Yet answered not when I asked wherefor.<br> In the night thou hast waked me at his side&#8212;<br> Dancing, in thy dark house, to the doors that soon must open<br> On thy white shining dawn-shores of life:<br> And I have seen the Moon-Woman's round face<br> Laughing through the smoke-hole, mocking,<br> Pointing to thy empty cradle hanging.<br> Ai! but her smile grew kind! She said,<br> "Wait a little longer, impatient one;<br> When next my round face peeps through the smoke-hole,<br> I will seek him at your breast."<br> Ai-i-hi! Very precious is the man-child!<br> Ere it is born a woman loves it.<br> How cam&#8217;st thou here, little Chiefling?<br> A woman gave thee life!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&#8212;my mother wept, watching me weave for thee&#8230;<br> And I have wept, too, a little.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange, that pain came with love;<br> I knew it not until thy father sought me.<br> Yet&#8212;what woman would cast love out?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gladly in the dusk I waited him&#8212;<br> None told me, not my mother even, of the pang.<br> So my heart, joyous, sounded a song of drums,<br> Beating the loud wild march for his swift-trampling feet.<br> The breasts of love were as the eaves of a house,<br> Jutting through the red mists and the dusk of ending day,<br> Calling the hunter to enter to his rest.<br> The door trembled with strange winds&#8212;<br> He circled my house with the arms of strength,<br> And took me with weapons&#8230;Joy?<br> Ay. Yet I cried from the depths with a sudden deep cry,</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="green">p. 174</font></A></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">And in grieving earth was the torch quenched.<br> &#8230;Darkness&#8230;and his, his utterly, in that dark&#8230;<br> None had told me&#8230;<br> Nor that his strength would leap, rejoicing at my cry.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dawn&#8212;it is our custom&#8212;I went forth alone<br> Into the mists that wrap the sleeping cedars<br> And droop to the pale unwakened sea.<br> Alone on the dawn's white rim I gathered cedar-boughs.<br> My tears fell, shining among the earth's bright drops;<br> For now I knew<br> Why the maiden plaits a whip of cedar-fibre,<br> To give into her husband's hand on her marriage-day.<br> Once I asked my father&#8212;it seemed so strange<br> A maid should weave and weave a rod for her own sorrow.<br> He laughed and said: "It is our custom; ay, an old custom&#8212;<br> I know not if it means aught now,<br> Or ever did have meaning."<br> My mother sat near. Ay, I have remembered that she spoke not;<br> But, silently, in the shadow of his body, drooped her head.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, &#8217;tis old, the custom,<br> Old as earth is old;<br> Ancient as passion,<br> Pitiless as passion&#8212;<br> Ay, pitiless, pitiless, the earth-way for women!<br> Bitter it is, as the taste of bright sea-water,<br> That he, who takes the gift, and wields our weaving of desire,<br> Knows not the meaning of the gift&#8212;nor can know ever!<br> Into the heedless hand of passion<br> We yield our power-of-pain&#8230;<br> It is the law of the earth-way.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is with birth-giving.<br> Aii-he! the mightier pang,<br> The mightier loving!</div></p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">And thou and thy father, the two Strong Ones,<br> Glad, glad of the woman's pain-cry!</p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M&#8217;-m&#8217;-m&#8217;-m&#8217;-n&#8212;Ai-i-he-i&#8212;<br> </i>Sleepest thou, little Fatling?<br> Ay, thou didst long drink at my breast&#8212;<br> (But hast not drained it of love.)<br> <i>Cedar, Cedar, carefully<br> Guard my little brown cone<br> On thy earth-bending branch.<br> M&#8217;-m&#8217;-m&#8217;-m&#8217;-n&#8212;Ai-i-he-i&#8212;<br> Little life-bud on the bough!<br> Sleep, sleep, thou drowsy one&#8212;<br> Thou art guarded well.<br> </i>Ay, rock, rock, safely, safely, little Man-Child&#8212;<br> A woman watches thee.</div></p>
