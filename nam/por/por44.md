### SONG OF QAQATCGUK

**TLINGIT**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The man who thought he had perished  
    dreams thus about himself:  
    I keep feeling  
    as if I had gotten home.

</div>

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

#### SONG OF WOMAN'S PREMONITION

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Already I am going,  
    I am going to die.  
I have dreamed of my son.

</div>

#### SONG OF RAVEN

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

That Raven must have been a great fellow.  
He went down under the sea.  
Then they pulled up his nose.  
He went through the town for his nose.  
When it was given him he started to fly out of doors.  
He flew out with it.  
Why! instead of looking like himself, he looks as if he ought  
    to have a drink.  
After you have done as he has done you can wander about the  
    entire world-beach.

</div>

#### CRADLE SONG FOR A GIRL

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

If I do not take anything to the party  
    I shall be ashamed,  
    I shall be ashamed.  
Little girls, listen.  
Little girls, listen.

</div>

#### CRADLE SONG

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Let me shoot a small bird  
    for my younger brother.  
Let me spear a small trout  
    for my younger sister.

#### SONG OF LITTLE-LAKE-UP-ABOVE

*(When his people expected others to come with food to give them a
feast)*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

It is before my face every day.  
And when I sleep I always think of you.  
I long much for you.  
Thinking about you comes to me  
    like a sudden sickness.

</div>

#### SONG OF SORROW

*(By a woman whose brothers were drowned and their bodies not
recovered)*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Your reef has beaten me,  
    Kágwantan's children.  
But take pity on me.  
I wonder what I always attend to  
    when I wake up in the morning.  
Sometime I might see my brothers.

</div>

#### COMPOSED BY SMALL-LAKE-UNDERNEATH

*(About a drifting log found full of nails, out of which a house was
built. Sung when a feast is about to be given for a dead man)*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I always compare you to a drifting log  
    with iron nails in it.  
Let my brother float in,  
    in that way.  
Let him float ashore  
    on a good sandy beach.  
I always compare you, my mother,  
    to the sun passing behind the clouds.  
That is what makes the world dark.

</div>

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

#### KAGWANTAN SONG FOR THE FEAST

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

(When a slave is to be killed)  
The words of people  
    now snow me under,  
    the words of worthless people.

</div>

#### SUNG BY THE WOLF FAMILIES

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

(Coming to a feast)  
A rich man is coming.  
Your feelings you keep silent.  
When it is ended,  
    thus they always say:  
    "It is all gone."

</div>

#### AT A GREAT FEAST

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

We are also going to be invited  
    to Killisnoo.  
High-cast people  
    are going to eat.

</div>

#### BY NAQUALI

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I wonder what my future life  
    will do to me.

</div>

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

#### SONG OF FOR-A-TOWN SPIRIT

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

(About the Táqdentan, because when the latter came to Juneau to drink
they did not pay any attention to the Auk people.)  
I observe how people are treated  
    after they are dead,  
    and therefore I drink  
    before I die.  
What you did was very selfish,  
    Táqdentan's children.  
But I do not blame you  
    for your words.  
It is this Raven's fault.

</div>

#### BY NIGOT

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

What do you think I live for?  
I live to drink whiskey.  
Have pity on me,  
    foam children.

#### BY TSAKAK

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

It is only crying about myself  
    that comes to me in song.

</div>

#### BY ONE OF THE LENÉDI

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

(About Juneau when gold was first found there)  
Do not talk any more,  
    Lenédi's children.  
You are ahead  
    of all the people in the world.

</div>

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

#### AN ANGRY SONG COMPOSED BY SEXDAGWET

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

(Against Little Raven, a blind man of Tongas)  
Just as if a man chased him  
    out on the beach  
    because of someone's talking,  
    Little Raven threw himself  
    before my words.  
I do not feel even a little numb.  
That fellow, Little Raven,  
    whose words  
    they are always reporting to me,  
    can not see anything.

*(On the same subject)  
*Little Raven,  
    I hate what you keep saying,  
    because you are a slave's son  
    and can see nothing.  
I hate to have you talk to me  
    because you have spots all over your face  
    like a big sea cucumber  
    and look like a slave.  
Don't you know that,  
    because you can not see anything,  
    you big slave's son,  
    you keep picking up sand  
    instead of dipping into the dish?

</div>

#### BY DEAD-SLAVE

*(About a woman named Poor-orphan, who was a very poor girl, but
afterward became the richest woman in Wrangell)  
*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I used to make fun  
    of this poor little girl at Wrangell  
    when she was very small.

</div>

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

#### BY A SHAMAN OF THE KÁGWANTAN NAMED KAGANK

It is only on account of Strong Drink  
    that you pity me.  
Why don't you also love me?

</div>

#### BY UNDER-A-BLANKET

*(About the son of Luknaxádi, whose brother was killed in compensation
for the killing of her brother)*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

His mind is just like mine,  
    Lubnaxádi's children.  
So that I am beginning to love him.  
I wonder what I always look for  
    when I wake up in the morning.  
Sometime I might see my brothers.

</div>

#### BY MAN-THAT-IS-NOT-ALL-RIGHT

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

(About Princess Thom)  
Even from a house of Strong Drink  
men get away,  
but not from you,  
Raven woman.

</div>

#### BY AMONG-THE-BRANT

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

(When his wife had been taken from him)  
Like one who desires Strong Drink,  
    I never sleep,  
    Toqyédi's children.

</div>

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

(On the same subject)  
My own mind is very hard to me.  
It is just as if  
    I were carrying my mind around.  
What is the matter with you?

</div>

#### BY OTHER-WATER

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

(Over a dead man)  
My younger brother has brought me  
    great joy of laughter.  
If I knew the way they go,  
    I would go right to him.

</div>

#### BY JOINED-TOGETHER

*(When all his friends went down the rapids at Gonaxó and were drowned)*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I always look expectantly  
    to see some one  
    stand up in front of the town  
    and in the bay.  
I always compare my brothers  
    to the people the duck tribe saved.  
They went right down under the earth  
    like those high-cast people.

</div>

#### BY HERE-IS-A-FEATHER

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

(When his brother died)  
It is as if my grandfather's house  
    were turning over with me.  
Where is the person who will save me?

#### BY MAN-FOR-HIMSELF

#### MOURNING SONG OF SAKWET

(About her brother who was drowned)  
I am like the people  
    who were killed  
    by the south wind.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

(On the same subject)  
Perhaps my brother went  
    into the sun's trail  
    so that I can never see him again.

</div>

#### PEACE-SONG AFTER A GREAT WAR

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

If you had died,  
    Kágwantan's children,  
    I would have cut off my hair for you  
I love you so much  
    I would have blackened my face for you,  
    Kágwantan's children.

</div>

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

#### SONG OF A HUMMING-BIRD DEER

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I am feeling very lonely away.  
I am going to my uncle's town.  
I am singing inside, my masters.  
I am crying about myself.

</div>

#### BY LQENA

*(When he was the only one of his people saved and his enemies wanted to
make peace with him. He danced as a deer, singing this song and at the
end of it cut in two the man standing next to him)*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I did this way regarding myself.  
I would not let what my conscience  
    said to me, pass.  
Before his death I saw his ghost.  
At once he stabbed  
    and killed Cadasíktc.

</div>

#### BY QAUCTE

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

(Who married a Téqoedi woman)  
After you have been drinking  
    you had better stop talking  
    about how well you were brought up,  
Téqoedi's children.  
What one of you thinks about it.  
    when he is sober?

</div>

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

#### LOVE SONG OF A TAGISH WOMAN

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

    that you have gone away?  
Here I am,  
    crying for you.

</div>

#### LOVE-SONG OF SIQUET, THE DANCER

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I wonder what this coming July morning  
    will be like.  
My mind is very weak  
    thinking that I shall be unable  
    to see my sweetheart.

</div>

#### BY RAVEN-SKIN

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

(When his sweetheart abandoned him)  
If one had control of death  
    it would be very easy  
    to die with a Wolf woman.  
It would be very pleasant.

</div>

#### MOURNING-SONG OF THE KÁGWANTAN

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

It is his own fault  
    that this man of the Wolf people died.  
Do not lay the blame on anyone else.
