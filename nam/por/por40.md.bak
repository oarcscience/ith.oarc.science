### THREE SONGS FROM THE HAIDA: QUEEN CHARLOTTE'S ISLAND, B.C.

**LOVE SONG**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Beautiful is she, this woman,  
As the mountain flower;  
But cold, cold, is she,  
Like the snowbank  
Behind which it blooms.

</div>

**THE BEAR'S SONG**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

(Whoever can sing this song is admitted forever to the friendship of the
bears)  
I have taken the woman of beauty  
For my wife;  
I have taken her from her friends.  
I hope her kinsmen will not come  
And take her away from me.  
I will be kind to her.  
Berries, berries I will give her from the hill  
And roots from the ground.  
I will do everything to please her.  
For her I made this song and for her I sing it.

</div>

**SONG FOR FINE WEATHER**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

O good Sun,  
Look thou down upon us:  
Shine, shine on us, O Sun,  
Gather up the clouds, wet, black, under thy arms—  
That the rains may cease to fall.  
Because thy friends are all here on the beach

</div>

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ready to go fishing  
Ready for the hunt.  
Therefore look kindly on us, O Good Sun!  
Give us peace within our tribe  
And with all our enemies.  
Again, again, we call  
Hear us, hear us, O Good Sun!

</div>
