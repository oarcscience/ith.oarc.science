#### NEITHER SPIRIT NOR BIRD

**SHOSHONE LOVE SONG**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Neither spirit nor bird;  
That was my flute you heard  
Last night by the River.  
When you came with your wicker jar  
Where the river drags the willows,  
That was my flute you heard,  
Wacoba, Wacoba,  
Calling, Come to the willows!

</div>

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Neither the wind nor a bird  
Rustled the lupin blooms,  
That was my blood you heard  
Answer your garment's hem  
Whispering through the grasses;  
That was my blood you heard  
By the wild rose under the willows.

That was no beast that stirred,  
That was my heart you heard  
Pacing to and fro  
In the ambush of my desire,  
To the music my flute let fall.  
Wacoba, Wacoba,  
That was my heart you heard  
Leaping under the willows.

</div>
