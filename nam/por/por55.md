### THE CHANGE-SONG

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

    Death's first snows are drifting on my cheek,  
Pale are my lips  
As the kiss of Cin-Uza;  
I lie low and still.  
Near me crouch my silent kinsmen,  
They hold the breath and wait the hour of wailing;  
They have wrapped the scarlet mourning blanket  
Round the shoulders of the oldest man;  
He has taken their sorrow.  
He droops at my door  
Like a bleeding hawk where the eagles have battled.  
He is so old he feels not any grief,  
His heart is cold,  
In his ears no sound is,  
And in his eyes no light.  
Therefore have my kinsmen given him their griefs—  
Because the dawn leaps clear into their eyes,  
Because the sound of women's feet  
Rustling on the cedar mats when the torch is blown  
Calls sweetly to their ears,  
And their hearts are beating for the hunt.  
They may not bear the sorrow of my passing,  
We have known strong joys together!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

    I take your loves, my kinsmen,  
I leave; with you no griefs!  
Sing, my kinsmen, when ye swing me  
To the topmost branches of the cedar.  
Sweet-smelling arms of cedar, reach for me,  
Tenderly receive me,  
Hold me in the Last Caress under open sky!  
Sing, my kinsmen, when the oldest man  
Takes his lone trail through the forest.  
He will wear no mourning-blanket when he comes again tomorrow!  
He will say, "Rejoice—  
I have borne your grief afar,  
I have buried it deep,  
The place is not known."  
The wind of your singing shall rock me  
In the arms of my mother, the cedar.  
Yet there is a sweeter song, my kinsmen;  
It is the Change-Song of Supreme One.  
I hear it now,  
He chants it to my heart;  
Because pale death has crossed my threshold, and has clasped my hand.  
"Fear not," sings Supreme One;  
"I am making pure, making pure,  
I destroy not life,  
I am Life-maker!"

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

    The oldest man has entered the forest,  
Ah! Ah! my kinsmen are wailing;  
They saw me depart with Death  
Into the White Change.  
But I go on—and on!  
And I sing the Change-Song of Supreme One:  

Ha-eohos la no-ya ai-a me la-la  
Q’ oalahag’ i-h-e-e la-wo!
