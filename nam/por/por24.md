### SONGS IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOUSE GOD

#### NAVAJO

#### I

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Truly in the East  
The white bean  
And the great corn-plant  
Are tied with the white lightning.  
Listen! rain approaches!  
The voice of the bluebird is heard.  
Truly in the East  
The white bean  
And the great squash  
Are tied with the rainbow,

Listen! rain approaches!  
The voice of the bluebird is heard.

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

From the top of the great corn-plant the water gurgles, I hear it;  
Around the roots the water foams, I hear it;  
Around the roots of the plants it foams, I hear it;  
From their tops the water foams, I hear it.

</div>

**III**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The corn grows up. The waters of the dark clouds drop, drop.  
The rain descends. The waters from the corn leaves drop, drop.  
The rain descends. The waters from the plants drop, drop.  
The corn grows up. The waters of the dark mists drop, drop.

</div>

**IV**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Shall I cull this fruit of the great corn-plant?  
Shall you break it? Shall I break it?  
Shall I break it? Shall you break it?  
Shall I? Shall you?  
Shall I cull this fruit of the great squash vine?  
Shall you pick it up? Shall I pick it up?  
Shall I pick it up? Shall you pick it up?  
Shall I? Shall you?

</div>
