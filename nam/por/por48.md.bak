### ESKIMO SONGS

#### OXAITOQ'S SONG

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I walk so long thus  
    inland, inland.  
I walk so long thus  
    inland, inland, and inland.  
I am not loved  
    inland, inland.  
I am not loved  
    she is the greatest of all  
    inland and inland.  
They love best  
    inland, inland.  
They love best  
    what I obtain  
    inland and inland.  
They love best  
    inland, inland.  
They love best  
    the food that I bring  
    inland and inland.

#### SUMMER SONG

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ajaja, it is pleasant,  
    it is pleasant at last  
    the great world  
    when it is summer at last.  
Ajaja, it is pleasant,  
    it is pleasant at last  
    the great world  
    when our caribous begin to come.  
Ajaja, they make great noise,

</div>

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

    they make great noise,  
    the brooks there in our country  
    when it is summer.  
Ajaja, this great water  
    has spread over the ice;  
    I cannot walk  
    to the rock across there.  
Ajaja, I feel sorry for them,  
    I feel sorry for them,  
    not being able to speak,  
    these gulls.  
Ajaja, I feel sorry for them,  
    I feel sorry for them,  
    not being able to speak,  
    these ravens.  
A great animal comes now;  
    no one observes it;  
    I keep it secret;  
    the ravens do not tell.  
Food like that I cannot obtain.  
    but quickly I got  
    little sculpins.  
Ajaja, he has found a smooth slope,  
    he has found a smooth slope,  
    to burrow into,  
    the bad old fox.
