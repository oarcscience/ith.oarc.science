### SONG OF THE HORSE

#### NAVAJO

    How joyous his neigh!  
Lo, the Turquoise Horse of Johano-ai,  
    How joyous his neigh,  
There on precious hides outspread standeth he;  
    How joyous his neigh,  
There on tips of fair fresh flowers feedeth he;  
    How joyous his neigh,  
There of mingled waters holy drinketh he;  
    How joyous his neigh,  
There he spurneth dust of glittering grains;  
    How joyous his neigh,  
There in mist of sacred pollen hidden, all hidden he;  
    How joyous his neigh,  
There his offspring many grow and thrive for evermore;  
    How joyous his neigh!
