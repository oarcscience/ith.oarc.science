### OJIBWA WAR SONGS

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Hear my voice, Birds of War!  
I prepare a feast for you to feed on;  
I see you cross the enemy's lines;  
Like you I shall go.  
I wish the swiftness of your wings;  
I wish the vengeance of your claws;  
I muster my friends;  
I follow your flight.  
Ho, you young men warriors,  
Bear your angers to the place of fighting!

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

From the south they came, Birds of War—  
Hark! to their passing scream.  
I wish the body of the fiercest,  
As swift, as cruel, as strong.  
I cast my body to the chance of fighting.  
Happy I shall be to lie in that place,  
In that place where the fight was,  
Beyond the enemy's line.

</div>

III

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Here on my breast have I bled!  
See—see! these are fighting-scars!  
Mountains tremble at my yell!  
I strike for life.

</div>
