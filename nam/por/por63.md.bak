#### PRAYER TO THE MOUNTAIN SPIRIT

**FROM THE NAVAJO**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Lord of the Mountain,  
Reared within the Mountain  
Young Man, Chieftain,  
Hear a young man's prayer!  
Hear a prayer for cleanness.  
Keeper of the strong rain,  
Drumming on the mountain;  
Lord of the small rain  
That restores the earth in newness;  
Keeper of the clean rain,  
Hear a prayer for wholeness,

Young Man, Chieftain,  
Hear a prayer for fleetness.

</div>

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Keeper of the deer's way,  
Reared among the eagles,  
Clear my feet of slothness.  
Keeper of the paths of men,  
Hear a prayer for straightness.

Hear a prayer for courage.  
Lord of the thin peaks,  
Reared amid the thunders;  
Keeper of the headlands  
Holding up the harvest,  
Keeper of the strong rocks  
Hear a prayer for staunchness.

Young Man, Chieftain,  
Spirit of the Mountain!

</div>
