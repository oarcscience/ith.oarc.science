#### SONGS OF KUMASTAMXO

**YUMA**

**I**

**WHEN THE SPIRIT-WIND APPROACHED**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The Wind is wandering, is wandering;  
The Wind is wandering, is wandering."

</div>

**II**

**WHEN HE BURNT THE UNCLEAN HOUSE**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The house will burn, will burn.  
The house will be crackling, will be crackling.  
It will blaze.  
We are going to dance.  
It is going to be lighted.  
It is going to be lighted.  
It will blaze.  
We are going to dance.  
Something bird-like is coming. <span id="fr_3"></span>[\*](#fn_3.md)

Bird-like tracks will be about the place.  
We are going to light this unclean house.  
It will blaze, blaze."

</div>

**III**

**WHEN HE MADE THE RIVER**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

    "This is my water, my water.  
    This is my river, my river.  
    We love its water.

</div>

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

We love its foamwood.  
It shall flow forever.  
It shall flow forever.  
When the weather grows hot, it shall rise and overflow its banks.  
It shall flow forever."

</div>

**IV**

**AFTER HE HAD FINISHED HIS CREATING**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Into the earth I go down, go down.  
Nothing but earth will I be seeing, will I be seeing.  
I sink down into the old river-bed,  
Down into the interior."

</div>

**V**

**WHEN HE BECAME THE EAGLE**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

    "I am springing, springing.  
    Wing-feathers!  
    Body-feathers!  
    On my hands wing-feathers.  
    On my body body-feathers."

</div>
