#### NOTE

"Tell me," I asked an Indian song-poet who had just taught me a song of
his composing, "when you made your song, which came first, words or
music?"

The Indian stared at me in puzzled surprise: "I made a song," he
answered, "a song is words and music—all comes together."

Because Indian poems are therefore really songs, conceived as a very
part of the iteration and intonation of music, I have endeavored in my
translations to hold in minutest detail to the original rhythm and
accent, believing that only thus can the Indian verse sing, through an
alien tongue, in its true form.
