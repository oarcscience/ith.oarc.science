### WAR SONGS

#### ZUNI

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

To you of the six regions  
Whose homes cover the earth  
I give shells..  
Yellow ant, blue ant, red ant, all color ant  
U—hu—we—u—hu—we-  
U—hu—we—u—hu—we.  
To you whose homes  
Are covered with mountain tops

</div>

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I give shells  
Yellow, blue, red, white, all color, black.  
When we meet the enemy  
A little arrow storm will arise.  
When we meet him on the road nearby  
He will never more inhale the sacred breath of day.  
I inhale the sacred breath of day.  
All come quickly,  
The enemy comes from ambush.  
A Navajo is killed,  
We inhale the sacred breath of day.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

You have met the enemy.  
He will never more inhale the sacred breath of day.  
The enemy is destroyed.  
Who will be our great Bow priest?  
Who is to become a Bow priest?  
Well! who will kick the scalp?  
His younger mother, his elder sister.  
Who will wash the scalp?  
His younger father, his elder brother.  
Well!  
Good!

</div>
