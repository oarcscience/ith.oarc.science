### EARLY MOON

The baby moon, a canoe, a silver papoose canoe, sails and sails in the
Indian West.

A ring of silver foxes, a mist of silver foxes, sit and sit around the
Indian moon.

One yellow star for a runner, and rows of blue stars for more runners,
keep a line of watchers.

O foxes, baby moon, runners, you are the panel of memory fire-white
writing tonight of the Red Man's dreams.

Who squats, legs crossed, and arms folded, matching its look against the
moon-face, the star-faces, of the West?

Who are the Mississippi Valley ghosts, of copper foreheads, riding wiry
ponies in the night?—no bridles, love arms on the pony necks, riding in
the night, a long old trail?

Why do they always come back when the silver foxes sit around the early
moon, a silver papoose, in the Indian West?
