#### BEAR SONG

**HAIDA**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Chief, chief, that I am,  
Be careful how you pull your grandfather around.  
Be careful how you pull around your grandfather  
As you sit beside him.  
I am too much of a boy for you.  
Chief, chief that I am,

Chief, chief that I am,  
I am already far away.  
At the cliff, coming from my passage through the mountains,  
I, hold up my head grandly.  
Chief, chief that I am,  
I am already far away from it.  
From my blue mountain I am now far away.  
On the Island I travel, led about proudly.  
From it I am far away.  
Chief, chief that I am.

Chief, chief that I am,  
They say that I have green mountains.  
They say that I went into the creek I own which stretches its length
afar.  
Chief, chief that I am.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Chief, chief that I am,  
When the sun rises I start traveling about.  
Now I am lying under a deadfall.  
Chief, chief that I am.

Chief, chief that I am,  
My power is all taken away,  
My power is all taken away.  
Chief, chief that I am,  
My power is all taken away,  
Chief, chief that I am.

Chief, chief, whither did my great brother wander proudly?  
My mind shakes as I go about.  
Chief, chief.

Chief, chief,  
Tell me where he fell.  
I do not know the place.  
Chief, chief, chief.
