### SONGS FOR THE GREAT FEAST TO THE DEAD

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

For our children are gone,  
    While those of our friends remain.  
*      Ai-ya-ya-yai.  
*Come back, nephew, come back, we miss you;  
*      Ai-ya-ya-yai.  
*Come back to us, our lost ones,  
    We have presents for you.  
*      Ai-ya-ya-yai.  
*Oh, my brother, come back to me,  
*      Ai-ya-ya-yai.  
*Come back, my brother, I am lonely,  
*      Ai-ya-ya-yai.  
*My brother come back and we  
    Will give you a small present,  
*      Ai-ya-ya-yai-yae-yai,* etc.  
My children, where are you?  
*      Ai-ya-ya-yai*.  
Come back to us, our children.  
    We are lonely and sad.  

      Ai-ya-ya-yai.

Come, brother, come.

*Come here, do.  
    sealskins for a tent you will get,

      A-la’-ai-ya’

</div>

**IV**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

We will sing a song.  
We will go down the current.  
The waves will rise;  
The waves will fall.  
The dogs will growl at us.

</div>
