#### SONG OF A PASSIONATE LOVER

**FROM THE YOKUT**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Come not near my songs,  
You who are not my lover,  
Lest from out that ambush  
Leaps my heart upon you!

When my songs are glowing  
As an almond thicket  
With the bloom upon it,  
Lies my heart in ambush  
All amid my singing;  
Come not near my songs,  
You who are not my lover!

Do not hear my songs,  
You who are not my lover,  
Over-sweet the heart is  
Where my love has bruised it,  
Breathe you not that fragrance,  
You who are not my lover!  
Do not stoop above my heart  
With its languor on you,  
Lest I should not know you  
From my own belovèd,  
Lest from out my singing  
Leaps my heart upon you!

</div>
