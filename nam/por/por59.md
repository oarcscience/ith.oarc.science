### THE WILD WOMAN'S LULLABY

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

What shall I sing to thee, Babe on my back?  
Song of the Eagle that mates with the storm!  
Hi-i-ri-i-ki! Ri-eek!  
The wild gale is weeping, driven before him  
To his nest on the black lone mast of the night;  
Swinging, swinging, far out, high out, over the sea!  
Hi-i-ri-i-ki! Ri-eek!  
Thy father is Eagle-Go-High, chief of thy tribe:  
Fiercest in war, wisest in council, swiftest in hunting,  
Harshest and fondest in the tent of his woman;  
He is my mate!

What shall I sing to thee, Babe on my back!  
Song of the wind that is wanton forever!  
Fleeing forever, luring and weeping, laughing and leaping forever;  
Calling forever—calling—for the chase of swift wings,  
For the drive and the smite of wild wings,  
For the fold of strong wings,  
For the sleep in warm wings.  
OO-o-roo-o-rrr-ufffff-oo! Thy mother is Storm-Dancer, daughter of
Winds.  
What art thou, Little Chiefling, babe of my heart?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The star that I plucked from the mast of the night,  
When the wings of thy father outstrove me.  
Hi-i-ri-i-ki! Ri-eek!  
Eagle-Go-High, this is thy son,—  
He falls asleep, smiling,  
To the scream of thy nesting-call.  
Hi-i-ri-i-ki! Ri-i-ki! Ri-eek!
