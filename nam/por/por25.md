### THE MOUNTAIN CHANT OF THE NAVAJO

**CHARACTER OF THE SONGS**

Some songs are self-explanatory or readily understood, but the greater
number cannot be comprehended without a full knowledge of the mythology
and of the symbolism to which they refer; they merely hint at mythic
conceptions. Many contain archaic expressions, for which the shaman can
assign a meaning,

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

but whose etymology cannot now be learned; and some embody obsolete
words whose meaning is lost even to the priesthood. There are many
vocables known to be meaningless and recited merely to fill out the
rhythm or to give a dignified length to the song. For the same reasons a
meaningless syllable. is often added or a significant syllable
duplicated. Other poetical licenses are taken, such as the omission of a
syllable, the change of accent, the substitution of one vowel for
another. The most familiar words are often distorted beyond recognition.
For these various reasons the task of noting and translating these songs
is one of considerable difficulty. In order to simplify the meaning of
certain chants repetitive phrases are set as refrains.

The cliff rose arrow  
Has swallowed  
And withdrawn it.  
The moon  
Is satisfied.

#### LAST WORDS OF THE PROPHET

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Farewell, my younger brother!  
From the holy places the gods come for me.  
You will never see me again; but when the showers pass and**  
**the thunders peal,  
"There," you will say, "is the voice of my elder brother."  
And when the harvest comes, of the beautiful birds and  
grasshoppers you will say,  
"There is the ordering of my elder brother!"

</div>

#### SONG OF BÉKOTSIDI WHEN HE MADE THINGS

*Both of the gods sang while they were at work, and this was the song
that Békotsidi sang to bless all that he was making. It was the first
song which he sang at this work.*

Now Békotsidi, that am I.  
*    For them I make*.  
Now child of Day Bearer am I.  
*    For them I make.  
*Now Day Bearer's beam of blue.  
*    For them I make.  
*Shines on my feet and your feet too.  
*    For them I make.  
*Horses of all kinds now increase.  
*    For them I make.  
*At my fingers' tips and yours.  
*    For them I make.  
*Beasts of all kinds now increase.  
*    For them I make.  
*The bluebirds now increase.  
*    For them I make.  
*Soft goods of all kinds now increase.

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

    *For them I make.*  
Now with the pollen they increase.  
*    For them I make.  
*Increasing now, they will last forever.  
*    For them I make.  
*In old age wandering on the trail of beauty.  
*    For them I make.  
*To form them fair, for them I labor.  
*    For them I make.*

#### SONGS OF DAWN BOY

**I**

Where my kindred dwell,  
*    There I wander.  
*The Red Rock House,  
*    There I wander.  
*Where dark kethawns are at the doorway,  
*    There I wander.  
*With the pollen of dawn upon my trail,  
*    There I wander.  
*At the yuni, the striped cotton hangs with pollen.  
*    There I wander.  
*Going around with it.  
*    There I wander.  
*Taking another, I depart with it.  
*    With it I wander.  
*In the house of long life,  
*    There I wander.  
*In the house of happiness,  
*    There I wander.  
*Beauty before me,  
*    With it I wander.  
*Beauty behind me,  
*    With it I wander.*

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

Beauty below me,  
*    With it I wander.  
*Beauty above me,  
*    With it I wander.  
*Beauty all around me,  
*    With it I wander.  
*In old age traveling,  
*    With it I wander.  
*On the beautiful trail I am,  
*    With it I wander.*

It is finished in beauty.  
In the house of evening light.  
From the story made of evening light.  
On the trail of evening light.  
O, House God!  
*(The rest as in I, except that lines 12 and 13 are transposed.)*

### A PRAYER

#### FOR SECOND DAY OF THE NIGHT CHANT

From the base of the east.  
From the base of the Pelado Peak.  
From the house made of mirage,  
From the story made of mirage,

## NIGHT CHANT

#### FOR THE NINTH SONG

In Tsegihi,  
In the house made of dawn,  
In the house made of evening twilight,  
In the house made of dark cloud,  
In the house made of rain and mist, of pollen, of grasshoppers,  
Where the dark mist curtains the doorway,  
The path to which is on the rainbow,  
Where the zig-zag lightning stands high on top,  
Where the he-rain stands high on top,  
Oh, male divinity!  
With your moccasins of dark clouds, come to us,  
With your mind enveloped in dark cloud, come to us,  
With the dark thunder above you, come to us soaring,  
With the shapen cloud at your feet, come to us soaring.  
With the far darkness made of the dark cloud over your head, come to us
soaring.  
With the far darkness made of the rain and the mist over your head, come
to us soaring,  
With the far darkness made of the rain and the mist over your head, come
to us soaring.  
With the zig-zag lightning flung out high over your head,  
With the rainbow hanging high over your head, come to us soaring.  
With the far darkness made of the dark cloud on the ends of your
wings,  
With the far darkness made of the rain and the mist on the ends of your
wings, come to us soaring,  
With the zig-zag lightning, with the rainbow hanging high on the ends of
your wings, come to us soaring.  
With the near darkness made of dark cloud of the rain and the mist, come
to us,  
With the darkness on the earth, come to us.

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

With these I wish the foam floating on the flowing water over the roots
of the great corn,  
I have made your sacrifice,  
I have prepared a smoke for you,  
My feet restore for me.  
My limbs restore, my body restore, my mind restore, my voice restore for
me.  
Today, take out your spell for me,  
Today, take away your spell for me.  
Away from me you have taken it,  
Far off from me it is taken,  
Far off you have done it.

Happily I recover,  
Happily I become cool,  
My eyes regain their power, my head cools, my limbs regain their
strength, I hear again.  
Happily for me the spell is taken off,  
Happily I walk; impervious to pain, I walk; light within, I walk;
joyous, I walk.  
Abundant dark clouds I desire,  
An abundance of vegetation I desire,  
An abundance of pollen, abundant dew, I desire.  
Happily may fair white corn, to the ends of the earth, come with you,  
Happily may fair yellow corn, fair blue corn, fair corn of all  
    kinds, plants of all kinds, goods of all kinds, jewels of all  
    kinds, to the ends of the earth, come with you.  
With these before you, happily may they come with you,  
With these behind, below, above, around you, happily may they come with
you,  
Thus you accomplish your tasks.

Happily the old men will regard you,  
Happily the old women will regard you,  
The young men and the young women will regard you,  
The children will regard you,

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

The chiefs will regard you,  
Happily, as they scatter in different directions, they will regard
you,  
Happily, as they approach their homes, they will regard you.

May their roads home be on the trail of peace,  
Happily may they all return.  
In beauty I walk,  
With beauty before me, I walk,  
With beauty behind me, I walk,  
With beauty above and about me, I walk,  
It is finished in beauty,  
It is finished in beauty.
