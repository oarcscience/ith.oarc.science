[Remarks on Ojibwa Ball Play by W.J. Hoffman](cbp.htm#ojibwa)

Among their other many cultural gifts to the world, Native Americans
contributed the game which later became known as Lacrosse. The Cherokee
Ball Play vividly describes the ethnography of this sport with
particular attention to its ritual significance.

This sport served as means of community social cohesion, an occasion for
some big wagers, a surrogate for battle with other villages, and sounds
like a great deal of fun. Many of the ceremonial aspects will be
familiar to anyone involved with High School football. Some of the
practices required a very high tolerance for pain. On a spiritual level
the game is a magical battle between shamans, and the rituals and
ceremonies used to gain advantage are of great interest.

This monograph includes musical notation for some of the songs
transcribed by none other than John Phillip Sousa.

A short monograph about Ojibwa ball play which was in the same volume as
the Mooney article is included as an appendix.

I have edited this document slightly so that some language in the
original document will not distract the modern reader. Five words have
been substitued with neutral equivalents (in wavy brackets) and one word
and one sentence have been omitted (indicated by ellipsis).
