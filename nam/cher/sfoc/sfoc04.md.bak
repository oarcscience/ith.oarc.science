## THE SWIMMER MANUSCRIPT.

Some time afterward an acquaintance was formed with a man named
A\`yû<sup>n</sup>'inï or "Swimmer," who proved to be so intelligent that
I spent several days with him, procuring information in regard to myths
and old customs. He told a number of stories in very good style, and
finally related the Origin of the Bear\[1\]. The bears were formerly a
part of the Cherokee tribe who decided to leave their kindred and go
into the forest. Their friends followed them and endeavored to induce
them to return, but the Ani-Tsâ'kahï, as they were called, were
determined to go. Just before parting from their relatives at the edge
of the forest, they turned to them and said, "It is better for you that
we should go; but we will teach you songs, and some day when you are in
want of food come out to the woods and sing these songs and we shall
appear and give you meat." Their

friends, after warning several songs from them, started back to their
homes, and after proceeding a short distance, turned around to take one
last look, but saw only a number of bears disappearing in the depths of
the forest. The songs which they learned are still sung by the hunter to
attract the bears.

When Swimmer had finished the story he was asked if he knew these songs.
He replied that he did, but on being requested to sing one he made some
excuse and was silent. After some further efforts the interpreter said
it would be useless to press the matter then as there were several other
Indians present, but that to-morrow we should have him alone with us and
could then make another attempt.

The next day Swimmer was told that if he persisted in his refusal it
would be necessary to employ some one else, as it was unfair in him to
furnish incomplete information when he was paid to tell all he knew. He
replied that he was willing to tell anything in regard to stories and
customs, but that these songs were a part of his secret knowledge and
commanded a high price from the hunters, who sometimes paid as much as
$5 for a single song, "because you can't kill any bears or deer unless
you sing them."

He was told that the only object in asking about the songs was to put
them on record and preserve them, so that when he and the half dozen old
men of the tribe were dead the world might be aware how much the
Cherokees had known. This appeal to his professional pride proved
effectual, and when he was told that a great many similar songs had been
sent to Washington by medicine men of other tribes, he promptly declared
that he knew as much as any of them, and that he would give all the
information in his possession, so that others might be able to judge for
themselves who knew most. The only conditions he made were that these
secret matters should be heard by no one else but the interpreter, and
should not be discussed when other Indians were present.

As soon as the other shamans learned what was going on they endeavored
by various means to persuade him to stop talking, or failing in this, to
damage his reputation by throwing out hints as to his honesty or
accuracy of statement. Among other objections which they advanced was
one which, however incomprehensible to a white man, was perfectly
intelligible to an Indian, viz.: That when he had told everything this
information would be taken to Washington and locked up there, and thus
they would be deprived of the knowledge. This objection was one of the
most difficult to overcome, as there was no line of argument with which
to oppose it.

These reports worried Swimmer, who was extremely, sensitive in regard to
his reputation, and he became restive under the insinuations of his
rivals. Finally on coming to work one day he produced a book from under
his ragged coat as he entered the house, and said proudly: "Look at that
and now see if I don't know something." It

was a small day-book of about 240 pages, procured originally from a
white man, and was about half filled with writing in the Cherokee
characters. A brief examination disclosed the fact that it contained
just those matters that had proved so difficult to procure. Here were
prayers, songs, and prescriptions for the cure of all kinds of
diseases--for chills, rheumatism, frostbites, wounds, bad dreams, and
witchery; love charms, to gain the affections of a woman or to cause her
to hate a detested rival; fishing charms, hunting charms--including the
songs without which none could ever hope to kill, any game; prayers to
make the corn grow, to frighten away storms, and to drive off witches;
prayers for long life, for safety among strangers, for acquiring
influence in council and success in the ball play. There were prayers to
the Long Man, the Ancient White, the Great Whirlwind, the Yellow
Rattlesnake, and to a hundred other gods of the Cherokee pantheon. It
was in fact an Indian ritual and pharmacopoeia.

After recovering in a measure from the astonishment produced by this
discovery I inquired whether other shamans had such books. "Yes," said
Swimmer, "we all have them." Here then was a clew to follow up. A
bargain was made by which be was to have another blank book into which
to copy the formulas, after which the original was bought. It is now
deposited in the library of the Bureau of Ethnology. The remainder of
the time until the return was occupied in getting an understanding of
the contents of the book.
