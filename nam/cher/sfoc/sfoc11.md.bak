As the medical formulas are first in number and importance it may be
well, for the better understanding of the theory involved, to give the
Cherokee account of

# THE ORIGIN OF DISEASE AND MEDICINE.

In the old days quadrupeds, birds, fishes, and insects could all talk,
and they and the human race lived together in peace and friendship. But
as time went on the people increased so rapidly that their settlements
spread over the whole earth and the poor animals found themselves
beginning to be cramped for room. This was bad enough, but to add to
their misfortunes man invented bows, knives, blowguns, spears, and
hooks, and began to slaughter the larger animals, birds and fishes for
the sake of their flesh or their skins, while the smaller creatures,
such as the frogs and worms, were crushed and trodden upon without
mercy, out of pure carelessness or contempt. In. this state of affairs
the animals resolved to consult upon measures for their common safety.

The bears were the first to meet in council in their townhouse in
Kuwa'hï, the "Mulberry Place,"\[1\] and the old White Bear chief
presided.

line, near Clingman's Dome.\]

After each in turn had made complaint against the way in which man
killed their friends, devoured their flesh and used their skins for his
own adornment, it was unanimously decided to begin war at once against
the human race. Some one asked what weapons man used to accomplish their
destruction. "Bows and arrows, of course," cried all the bears in
chorus. "And what are they made of?" was the next question. "The bow of
wood and the string of our own entrails," replied one of the bears. It
was then proposed that they make a bow and some arrows and see if they
could not turn man's weapons against himself. So one bear got a nice
piece of locust wood and another sacrificed himself for the good of the
rest in order to furnish a piece of his entrails for the string. But
when everything was ready and the first bear stepped up to make the
trial it was found that in letting the arrow fly after drawing back the
bow, his long claws caught the string and spoiled the shot. This was
annoying, but another suggested that he could overcome the difficulty by
cutting his claws, which was accordingly done, and on a second trial it
was found that the arrow went straight to the mark. But here the chief,
the old White Bear, interposed and said that it was necessary that they
should have long claws in order to be able to climb trees. "One of us
has already died to furnish the bowstring, and if we now cut off our
claws we shall all have to starve together. It is better to trust to the
teeth and claws which nature has given us, for it is evident that man's
weapons were not intended for us."

No one could suggest any better plan, so the old chief dismissed the
council and the bears dispersed to their forest haunts without having
concerted any means for preventing the increase of the human race. Had
the result of the council been otherwise, we should now be at war with
the bears, but as it is the hunter does not even ask the bear's pardon
when he kills one.

The deer next held a council under their chief, the Little Deer, and
after some deliberation resolved to inflict rheumatism upon every hunter
who should kill one of their number, unless he took care to ask their
pardon for the offense. They sent notice of their decision to the
nearest settlement of Indians and told them at the same time how to make
propitiation when necessity forced them to kill one of the deer tribe.
Now, whenever the hunter brings down a deer, the Little Deer, who is
swift as the wind and can not be wounded, runs quickly up to the spot
and bending over the blood stains asks the spirit of the deer if it has
heard the prayer of the hunter for pardon. If the reply be "Yes" all is
well and the Little Deer goes on his way, but if the reply be in the
negative he follows on the trail of the hunter, guided by the drops of
blood on the ground, until he arrives at the cabin in the settlement,
when the Little Deer enters invisibly and strikes the neglectful hunter
with rheumatism, so that

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

he, is rendered on the instant a helpless cripple. No hunter who has
regard for his health ever fails to ask pardon of the deer for killing
it, although some who have not learned the proper formula may attempt to
turn aside the Little Deer from his pursuit by building a fire behind
them in the trail.

Next came the fishes and reptiles, who had their own grievances against
humanity. They held a joint council and determined to make their victims
dream of snakes twining about them in slimy folds and blowing their
fetid breath in their faces, or to make them dream of eating raw or
decaying fish, so that they would lose appetite, sicken, and die. Thus
it is that snake and fish dreams are accounted for.

Finally the birds, insects, and smaller animals came together for a like
purpose, and the Grubworm presided over the deliberations. It was
decided that each in turn should express an opinion and then vote on the
question as to whether or not man should be deemed guilty. Seven votes
were to be sufficient to condemn him. One after another denounced man's
cruelty and injustice toward the other animals and voted in favor of his
death. The Frog (walâ'sï) spoke first and said: "We must do something to
check the increase of the race or people will become so numerous that we
shall be crowded from off the earth. See how man has kicked me about
because I'm ugly, as he says, until my back is covered with sores;" and
here he showed the spots on his skin. Next came the Bird (tsi'skwa; no
particular species is indicated), who condemned man because "he burns my
feet off," alluding to the way in which the hunter barbecues birds by
impaling them on a stick set over the fire, so that their feathers and
tender feet are singed and burned. Others followed in the same strain.
The Ground Squirrel alone ventured to say a word in behalf of man, who
seldom hurt him because he was so small; but this so enraged the others
that they fell upon the Ground Squirrel and tore him with their teeth
and claws, and the stripes remain on his back to this day.

The assembly then began to devise and name various diseases, one after
another, and had not their invention finally failed them not one of the
human race would have been able to survive. The Grubworm in his place of
honor hailed each new malady with delight, until at last they had
reached the end of the list, when some one suggested that it be arranged
so that menstruation should sometimes prove fatal to woman. On this he
rose up in his place and cried: "Wata'<sup>n</sup>! Thanks! I'm glad
some of them will die, for they are getting so thick that they tread on
me." He fairly shook with joy at the thought, so that he fell over
backward and could not get on his feet again, but had to wriggle off on
his back, as the Grubworm has done ever since.

When the plants, who were friendly to man, heard what had been

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

done by the animals, they determined to defeat their evil designs. Each
tree, shrub, and herb, down even to the grasses and mosses, agreed to
furnish a remedy for some one of the diseases named, and each said: "I
shall appear to help man when he calls upon me in his need." Thus did
medicine originate, and the plants, every one of which has its use if we
only knew it, furnish the antidote to counteract the evil wrought by the
revengeful animals. When the doctor is in doubt what treatment to apply
for the relief of a patient, the spirit of the plant suggests to him the
proper remedy.
