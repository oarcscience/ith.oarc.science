#### Translation.

### THIS TELLS ABOUT GOING INTO THE WATER.

Listen! O, now instantly, you have drawn near to hearken, O
Agë'\`yagu'ga. You have come to put your red spittle upon my body. My
name is (Gatigwanasti.) The blue had affected me. You have come and
clothed me with a red dress. She is of the (Deer) clan. She has become
blue. You have directed her paths straight to where I have my feet, and
I shall feel exultant. Listen!

#### Explanation.

This formula, from Gatigwanasti's book, is also of the
Yû<sup>n</sup>wë'hï class, and is repeated by the lover when about to
bathe in the stream preparatory to painting himself for the dance. The
services of a shaman are not required, neither is any special ceremony
observed. The technical word used in the heading, ä'tawasti'yï,
signifies plunging or going entirely into a liquid. The expression used
for the ordinary "going to water," where the water is simply dipped up
with the hand, is ämâ'yï dita\`ti'yï, "taking them to water."

The prayer is addressed to Agë'\`yaguga, a formulistic name for the
moon, which is supposed to exert a great influence in love affairs,
because the dances, which give such opportunities for love making,
always take place at night. The shamans can not explain the meaning of
the term, which plainly contains the word agë'\`ya, "woman," and may
refer to the moon's supposed influence over women. In Cherokee mythology
the moon is a man. The ordinary name is nû'<sup>n</sup>dâ, or more
fully, nû'<sup>n</sup>dâ sû<sup>n</sup>nâyë'hï, "the sun living in the
night," while the sun itself is designated as nû'<sup>n</sup>ndâ igë'hï,
"the sun living in the day."

By the red spittle of Agë'\`yagu'ga and the red dress with which the
lover is clothed are meant the red paint which he puts upon himself.
This in former days was procured from a deep red clay known as
ela-wâ'tï, or "reddish brown clay." The word red as used in the formula
is emblematic of success in attaining his object, besides being the
actual color of the paint. Red, in connection with dress or
ornamentation, has always been a favorite color with Indians throughout
America, and there is some evidence that among the Cherokees it was
regarded also as having a mysterious protective power. In all these
formulas the lover renders the woman blue or disconsolate and uneasy in
mind as a preliminary to fixing her thoughts upon himself. (*See next
formula*.)
