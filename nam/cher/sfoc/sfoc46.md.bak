Listen! O, now you have drawn near to hearken, O, Ancient One. This
man's (woman's) soul has come to rest at the edge of your body. You are
never to let go your hold upon it. It is ordained that you shall do just
as you are requested to do. Let her never think upon any other place.
Her soul has faded within her. She is bound by the black threads.

#### Explanation.

This formula is said by the young husband, who has just married an
especially engaging wife, who is liable to be attracted by other men.
The same formula may also be used by the woman to fix her husband's
affections. On the first night that they are together the husband
watches until his wife is asleep, when, sitting up by her side, he
recites the first words: Sgë! Ha-nâ'gwa hatû'<sup>n</sup>gani'ga nihï',
and then sings the next four words: Tsawatsi'lû tsïkï' tsïkû' ayû',
"Your spittle, I take it, I eat it," repeating the words four times.
While singing he moistens his fingers with spittle, which he rubs upon
the breast of the woman. The next night he repeats the operation, this
time singing the words, "I take your body." The third night, in the same
way, he sings, "I take your flesh," and the fourth and last night, he
sings "I take your heart," after which he repeats the prayer addressed
to the Ancient One, by which is probably meant the Fire (the Ancient
White). A\`yû<sup>n</sup>inï states that the final sentences should be
masculine, i. e., His soul has faded, etc., and refer to any would-be
seducer. There is no gender distinction in the third person in Cherokee.
He claimed that this ceremony was so effective that no husband need have
any fears for his wife after performing it.
