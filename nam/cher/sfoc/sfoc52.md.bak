#### Translation.

### WHAT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TO WAR DID TO HELP THEMSELVES.

Hayï'! Yû! Listen! Now instantly we have lifted up the red war club.
Quickly his soul shall be without motion. There under the earth, where
the black war clubs shall be moving about like ball sticks in the game,
there his soul shall be, never to reappear. We cause it to be so. He
shall never go and lift up the war club. We cause it to be so. There
under the earth the black war club (and) the black fog have come
together as one for their covering. It shall never move about (i. e.,
the black fog shall never be lifted from them). We cause it to be so.

Instantly shall their souls be moving about there in the seventh heaven.
Their souls shall never break in two. So shall it be. Quickly we have
moved them (their souls) on high for them, where they shall be going
about in peace. You (?) have shielded yourselves (?) with the red war
club. Their souls shall never be knocked about. Cause it to be so. There
on high their souls shall be going about. Let them shield themselves
with the white war whoop. Instantly (grant that) they shall never become
blue. Yû!

#### Explanation.

This formula, obtained from A\`wani'ta, may be repeated by the doctor
for as many as eight men at once when about to go to war. It is recited
for four consecutive nights, immediately before setting

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

out. There is no tabu enjoined and no beads are used, but the warriors
"go to water" in the regular way, that is, they stand at the edge of the
stream, facing the east and looking down upon the water, while the
shaman, standing behind them, repeats the formula. On the fourth night
the shaman gives to each man a small charmed root which has the power to
confer invulnerability. On the eve of battle the warrior after bathing
in the running stream chews a portion of this and spits the juice upon
his body in order that the bullets of the enemy may pass him by or slide
off from his skin like drops of water. Almost every man of the three
hundred East Cherokees who served in the rebellion had this or a similar
ceremony performed before setting out--many of them also consulting the
oracular ulû'<sup>n</sup>sû'tï stone at the same time--and it is but
fair to state that not more than two or three of the entire number were
wounded in actual battle.

In the formula the shaman identifies himself with the warriors,
asserting that "we" have lifted up the red war club, red being the color
symbolic of success and having no reference to blood, as might be
supposed from the connection. In the first paragraph he invokes curses
upon the enemy, the future tense verb *It shall be*, etc., having
throughout the force of *let it be*. He puts the souls of the doomed
enemy in the lower regions, where the black war clubs are constantly
waving about, and envelops them in a black fog, which shall never be
lifted and out of which they shall never reappear. From the expression
in the second paragraph, "their souls shall never be knocked about," the
reference to the black war clubs moving about like ball sticks in the
game would seem to imply that they are continually buffeting the doomed
souls under the earth. The spirit land of the Cherokees is in the west,
but in these formulas of malediction or blessing the soul of the doomed
man is generally consigned to the underground region, while that of the
victor is raised by antithesis to the seventh heaven.

Having disposed of the enemy, the shaman in the second paragraph turns
his attention to his friends and at once raises their souls to the
seventh heaven, where they shall go about in peace, shielded by
(literally, "covered with") the red war club of success, and never to be
knocked about by the blows of the enemy. "Breaking the soul in two" is
equivalent to snapping the thread of life, the soul being regarded as an
intangible something having length, like a rod or a string. This
formula, like others written down by the same shaman, contains several
evident inconsistencies both as to grammar and mythology, due to the
fact that A\`wanita is extremely careless with regard to details and
that this particular formula has probably not been used for the last
quarter of a century. The warriors are also made to shield themselves
with the white war whoop, which should undoubtedly be the red war whoop,
consistent with the red

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

war club, white being the color emblematic of peace, which is evidently
an incongruity. The war whoop is believed to have a positive magic power
for the protection of the warrior, as well as for terrifying the foe.

The mythologic significance of the different colors is well shown in
this formula. Red, symbolic of success, is the color of the war club
with which the warrior is to strike the enemy and also of the other one
with which he is to shield or "cover" himself. There is no doubt that
the war whoop also should be represented as red. In conjuring with the
beads for long life, for recovery from sickness, or for success in love,
the ball play, or any other undertaking, the red beads represent the
party for whose benefit the magic spell is wrought, and he is
figuratively clothed in red and made to stand upon a red cloth or placed
upon a red seat. The red spirits invoked always live in the east and
everything pertaining to them is of the same color.

Black is always typical of death, and in this formula the soul of the
enemy is continually beaten about by black war clubs and enveloped in a
black fog. In conjuring to destroy an enemy the shaman uses black beads
and invokes the black spirits--which always live in the west--bidding
them tear out the man's soul, carry it to the west, and put it into the
black coffin deep in the black mud, with a black serpent coiled above
it.

Blue is emblematic of failure, disappointment, or unsatisfied desire.
"They shall never become blue" means that they shall never fail in
anything they undertake. In love charms the lover figuratively covers
himself with red and prays that his rival shall become entirely blue and
walk in a blue path. The formulistic expression, "He is entirely blue,"
closely approximates in meaning the common English phrase, "He feels
blue." The blue spirits live in the north.

White--which occurs in this formula only by an evident error--denotes
peace and happiness. In ceremonial addresses, as at the green corn dance
and ball play, the people figuratively partake of white food and after
the dance or the game return along the white trail to their white
houses. In love charms the man, in order to induce the woman to cast her
lot with his, boasts "I am a white man," implying that all is happiness
where he is. White beads have the same meaning in the bead conjuring and
white was the color of the stone pipe anciently used in ratifying peace
treaties. The white spirits live in the south (Wa'halä).

Two other colors, brown and yellow, are also mentioned in the formulas.
Wâtige'ï, "brown," is the term used to include brown, bay, dun, and
similar colors, especially as applied to animals. It seldom occurs in
the formulas and its mythologic significance is as yet undetermined.
Yellow is of more frequent occurrence and is typical of trouble and all
manner of vexation, the yellow spirits

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

being generally invoked when the shaman wishes to bring down calamities
upon the head of his victim, without actually destroying him. So far as
present knowledge goes, neither brown nor yellow can be assigned to any
particular point of the compass.

Usïnuli'yu, rendered "instantly," is the intensive form of usïnu'lï
"quickly," both of which words recur constantly in the formulas, in some
entering into almost every sentence. This frequently gives the
translation an awkward appearance. Thus the final sentence above, which
means literally "they shall never become blue instantly," signifies
"Grant that they shall never become blue, i. e., shall never fail in
their purpose, *and grant our petition instantly*."
