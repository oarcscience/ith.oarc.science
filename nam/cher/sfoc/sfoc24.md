# COLOR SYMBOLISM.

Color symbolism plays an important part in the shamanistic system of the
Cherokees, no less than in that of other tribes. Each one of the
cardinal points has its corresponding color and each color its symbolic
meaning, so that each spirit invoked corresponds in color and local
habitation with the characteristics imputed to him, and is connected
with other spirits of the same name, but of other colors, living in
other parts of the upper world and differing widely in their
characteristics. Thus the Red Man, living in the east, is the spirit of
power, triumph, and success, but the Black Man, in the West, is the
spirit of death. The shaman therefore invokes the Red Man to the
assistance of his client and consigns his enemy to the fatal influences
of the Black Man.

The symbolic color system of the Cherokees, which will be explained more
fully in connection with the formulas, is as follows:

|           |        |                                |
|-----------|--------|--------------------------------|
| East      | red    | success; triumph.              |
| North     | blue   | defeat; trouble.               |
| West      | black  | death.                         |
| South     | white  | peace; happiness.              |
| Above?    | brown  | unascertained, but propitious. |
| --------- | yellow | about the same as blue.        |

 

There is a great diversity in the color systems of the various tribes,
both as to the location and significance of the colors, but for obvious
reasons black was generally taken as the symbol of death, while white
and red signified, respectively, peace and war. It is somewhat

remarkable that red was the emblem of power and triumph among the
ancient Oriental nations no less than among the modern Cherokees.\[1\]
