# The Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees.

## By JAMES MOONEY.

#### \[1891\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an ethnographic description of Cherokee [shamanistic
practice](../../../sha/index). Based on several manuscripts written by
Cherokee shamans of the 19th Century, this includes the actual text of
the rituals to treat various diseases, information on herbs used, love
spells, hunting rituals, weather spells, as well as a spell for victory
in the [Ball game](../cbp/index).
