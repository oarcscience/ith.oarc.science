#### Explanation.

This song, obtained from A\`yû<sup>'n</sup>inï in connection with the
story of the Origin of the Bear, as already mentioned, is sung by the
bear hunter, in order to attract the bears, while on his way from the
camp to the place where he expects to hunt during the day. It is one of
those taught the Cherokees by the Ani-Tsâ'kahï before they lost their
human shape and were transformed into bears. The melody is simple and
plaintive.

The song consists of four verses followed by a short recitation. Each
verse begins with a loud prolonged *He* **+**! and ends with *Yoho'*
**+**! uttered in the same manner. Hayuya'haniwä' has no meaning.
Tsistu'yï, Kuwâ'hï, Uyâ'\`yë, and Gâte'kwâhï are four mountains, in each
of which the bears have a townhouse and hold a dance before going into
their dens for the winter. The first three named are high peaks in the
Smoky Mountains, on the Tennessee line, in the neighborhood of
Clingman's Dome and Mount Guyot. The fourth is southeast of Franklin,
North Carolina, toward the South Carolina line, and may be identical
with Fodderstack Mountain. In Kuwahi dwells the great bear chief and
doctor, in whose magic bath the wounded bears are restored to health.
They are said to originate or be conceived in the mountains named,
because these are their headquarters. The "good black things" referred
to in the recitation are the bears.
