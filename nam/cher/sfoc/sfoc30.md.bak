### THIS IS TO TREAT THEM IF THEY ARE BITTEN BY A SNAKE.

1\. Dûnu'wa, dûnu'wa, dûnu'wa, dûnu'wa, dûnu'wa, dûnu'wa.  
    Listen! Ha! It is only a common frog which has passed by and put it
(the intruder) into you.  
2. Dayuha', dayuha, dayuha, dayuha, dayuha.  
    Listen! Ha! It is only an *Us'\`gï* which has passed by and put it
into you.

(Prescription.)--Now this at the beginning is a song. One should say it
twice and also say the second line twice. Rub tobacco (juice) on the
bite for some time, or if there be no tobacco just rub on saliva once.
In rubbing it on, one must go around four times. Go around toward the
left and blow four times in a circle. This is because in lying down the
snake always coils to the right and this is just the same (*lit.* "means
like") as uncoiling it.

#### Explanation.

This is also from the manuscript book of Gahuni, deceased, so that no
explanation could be obtained from the writer. The formula consists of a
song of two verses, each followed by a short recitation.

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

The whole is repeated, according to the directions, so as to make four
verses or songs; four, as already stated, being the sacred number
running through most of these formulas. Four blowings and four circuits
in the rubbing are also specified. The words used in the songs are
sometimes composed of unmeaning syllables, but in this case dûnuwa and
dayuha seem to have a meaning, although neither the interpreter nor the
shaman consulted could explain them, which may be because the words have
become altered in the song, as frequently happens. Dûnu'wa appears to be
an old verb, meaning "it has penetrated," probably referring to the
tooth of the reptile. These medicine songs are always sung in a low
plaintive tone, somewhat resembling a lullaby. Usu'\`gï also is without
explanation, but is probably the name of some small reptile or
batrachian.

As in this case the cause of the trouble is evident, the Indians have no
theory to account for it. It may be remarked, however, that when one
dreams of being bitten, the same treatment and ceremonies must be used
as for the actual bite; otherwise, although perhaps years afterward, a
similar inflammation will appear on the spot indicated in the dream, and
will be followed by the same fatal consequences, The rattlesnake is
regarded as a supernatural being or ada'wehi, whose favor must be
propitiated, and great pains are taken not to offend him. In consonance
with this idea it is never said among the people that a person has been
bitten by a snake, but that he has been "scratched by a brier." In the
same way, when an eagle has been shot for a ceremonial dance, it is
announced that "a snowbird has been killed," the purpose being to
deceive the rattlesnake or eagle spirits which might be listening.

The assertion that it is "only a common frog" or" only an Usu'?gï brings
out another characteristic idea of these formulas. Whenever the ailment
is of a serious character, or, according to the Indian theory, whenever
it is due to the influence of some powerful disease spirit the doctor
always endeavors to throw contempt upon the intruder, and convince it of
his own superior power by asserting the sickness to be the work of some
inferior being, just as a white physician might encourage a patient far
gone with consumption by telling him that the, illness was only a slight
cold. Sometimes there is a regular scale of depreciation, the doctor
first ascribing the disease to a rabbit or groundhog or some other weak
animal, then in succeeding paragraphs mentioning other still less
important animals and finally declaring it to be the work of a mouse, a
small fish, or some other insignificant creature. In this instance an
ailment caused by the rattlesnake, the most dreaded of the animal
spirits, is ascribed to a frog, one of the least importance.

In applying the remedy the song is probably sung while rubbing the
tobacco juice around the wound. Then the short recitation is repeated
and the doctor blows four times in a circle about the spot.

The whole ceremony is repeated four times. The curious directions for
uncoiling the snake have parallels in European folk medicine.
