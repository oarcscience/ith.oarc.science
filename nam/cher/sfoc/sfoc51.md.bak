### THIS IS TO FRIGHTEN A STORM.

Yuhahi', yuhahi', yuhahi', yuhahi', yuhahi',  
Yuhahi', yuhahi', yuhahi', yuhahi', yuhahi'--Yû!

Listen! O now you are coming in rut. Ha! I am exceedingly afraid of you.
But yet you are only tracking your wife. Her footprints can be seen
there directed upward toward the heavens. I have pointed them out for
you. Let your paths stretch out along the tree tops (?) on the lofty
mountains (and) you shall have them (the paths) lying down without being
disturbed, Let (your path) as you go along be where the waving branches
meet. Listen!

#### Explanation.

This formula, from A\`yû'<sup>n</sup>inï's book, is for driving away, or
"frightening" a storm, which threatens to injure the growing corn. The
first part is a meaningless song, which is sting in a low tone in the
peculiar style of most of the sacred songs. The storm, which is not
directly named, is then addressed and declared to be coming on in a
fearful manner on the track of his wife, like an animal in the rutting
season. The shaman points out her tracks directed toward

the upper regions and begs the storm spirit to follow her along the
waving tree tops of the lofty mountains, where he shall be undisturbed.

The shaman stands facing the approaching storm with one hand stretched
out toward it. After repeating the song and prayer he gently blows in
the direction toward which he wishes it to go, waving his hand in the
same direction as though pushing away the storm. A part of the storm is
usually sent into the upper regions of the atmosphere. If standing at
the edge of the field, he holds a blade of corn in one hand while
repeating the ceremony.
