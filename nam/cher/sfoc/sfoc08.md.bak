## OTHER MANUSCRIPTS.

Subsequently a few formulas were obtained from an old shaman named
Tsiskwa or "Bird," but they were so carelessly written as to be almost
worthless, and the old mail who wrote them, being then on his dying bed,
was unable to give much help in the matter. However, as he was anxious
to tell what he knew all attempt was made to take down some formulas
from his dictation. A few more were obtained in this way but the results
were not satisfactory and the experiment was abandoned. About the same
time A\`wani'ta or "Young Deer," one of their best herb doctors, was
engaged to collect the various plants used in medicine and describe
their uses. While thus employed he wrote in a book furnished him for the
purpose a number of formulas used by him in his practice, giving at the
same time a verbal explanation of the theory and ceremonies. Among these
was one for protection in battle, which had been used by himself and a
number of other Cherokees in the late war. Another doctor named
Takwati'hï or "Catawba Killer," was afterward employed on the same work
and furnished some additional formulas which he had had his son write
down from his dictation, he himself being unable to write. His knowledge
was limited to the practice of a few specialties, but in regard to these
his information

was detailed and accurate. There was one for bleeding with the cupping
horn. All these formulas obtained from Tsiskwa, A\`wanita, and Takwtihi
are now in possession of the Bureau.
