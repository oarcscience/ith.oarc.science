### INAGË'HÏ AYÂSTI<sup>n</sup>YÏ.

aye\`li'yu, usïnuli'yu. Yû!

#### Translation.

### TO SHOOT DWELLERS IN THE WILDERNESS.

Instantly the Red Selagwû'tsï strike you in the very center of your
soul--instantly. Yû!

#### Explanation.

This short formula, obtained from A\`wani'ta, is recited by the hunter
while taking aim. The bowstring is let go--or, rather, the trigger is
pulled--at the final *Yû!* He was unable to explain the meaning of the
word selagwû'tsï further than that it referred to the bullet. Later
investigation, however, revealed the fact that this is the Cherokee name
of a reed of the genus Erianthus, and the inference follows that the
stalk of the plant was formerly used for arrow shafts. Red implies that
the arrow is always successful in reaching the mark aimed at, and in
this instance may refer also to its being bloody when withdrawn from the
body of the animal. Inagë'hï, "dwellers in the wilderness," is the
generic term for game, including birds, but A\`wani'ta has another
formula intended especially for deer.
