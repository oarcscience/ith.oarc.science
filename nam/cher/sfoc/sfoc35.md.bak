### THIS IS TO MAKE CHILDREN JUMP DOWN.

Listen! You little man, get up now at once. There comes an old woman.
The horrible \[old thing\] is coming, only a little way off. Listen!
Quick! Get your bed and let us run away. Yû!

Listen! You little woman, get up now at once. There comes your
grandfather. The horrible old fellow is coming only a little way off.
Listen! Quick! Get your bed and let us run away. Yû!

#### Explanation.

In this formula for childbirth the idea is to frighten the child and
coax it to come, by telling it, if a boy, that an ugly old woman is
coming, or if a girl, that her grandfather is coming only a short
distance away. The reason of this lies in the fact that an old woman is
the terror of all the little boys of the neighborhood, constantly
teasing and frightening them by declaring that she means to live until
they grow up and then compel one of them to marry her, old and shriveled
as she is. For the same reason the maternal grandfather, who is always a
privileged character in the family, is especially dreaded by the little
girls, and nothing will send a group of children running into the house
more quickly than the announcement that an old "granny," of either sex
is in sight.

As the sex is an uncertain quantity, the possible boy is always first
addressed in the formulas, and if no result seems to follow, the doctor
then concludes that the child is a girl and addresses her in similar
tones. In some cases an additional formula with the beads is used to
determine whether the child will be born alive or dead. In most

instances the formulas were formerly repeated with the appropriate
ceremonies by some old female relative of the mother, but they are now
the property of the ordinary doctors, men as well as women.

This formula was obtained from the manuscript book of
A\`yû'<sup>n</sup>inï, who stated that the medicine used was a warm
decoction of a plant called Dalâ'nige Unaste'tsï ("yellow root"--not
identified), which was blown successively upon the top of the mother's
head, upon the breast, and upon the palm of each hand. The doctor stands
beside the woman, who is propped up in a sitting position, while
repeating the first paragraph and then blows. If this produces no result
he then recites the paragraph addressed to the girl and again blows. A
part of the liquid is also given to the woman to drink.
A\`yû'<sup>n</sup>inï claimed this was always effectual.

### THIS IS TO MAKE CHILDREN JUMP DOWN.

Little boy, little boy, hurry, hurry, come out, come out! Little boy,
hurry; a bow, a bow; let's see who'll get it, let's see who'll get it!

Little girl, little girl, hurry, hurry, come out, come out, Little girl,
hurry; a sifter, a sifter; let's see who'll get it, let's see who'll get
it!

#### Explanation.

This formula was obtained from Takwati'hï, as given to him by a
specialist in this line. Takwatihi himself knew nothing of the treatment
involved, but a decoction is probably blown upon the patient as
described in the preceding formula. In many cases the medicine used is
simply cold water, the idea being to cause a sudden muscular action by
the chilling contact. In this formula the possible boy or girl is coaxed
out by the promise of a bow or a meal-sifter to the one who can get it
first. Among the Cherokees it is common, in asking about the sex of a
new arrival, to inquire, "Is it a bow or a sifter?" or "Is it ball
sticks or bread?"
