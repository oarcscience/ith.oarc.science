# THE CHEROKEE GODS AND THEIR ABIDING PLACES.

After what has been said in elucidation of the theories involved in the
medical formulas, the most important and numerous of the series, but
little remains to be added in regard to the others, beyond what is
contained in the explanation accompanying each one. A few points,
however, may be briefly noted.

The religion of the Cherokees, like that of most of our North American
tribes, is zootheism or animal worship, with the survival of that
earlier stage designated by Powell as hecastotheism, or the worship of
all things tangible, and the beginnings of a higher system in which the
elements and the great powers of nature are deified. Their pantheon
includes gods in the heaven above, on the earth beneath, and in the
waters under the earth, but of these the animal gods constitute by far
the most numerous class, although the elemental gods are more important.
Among the animal gods insects and fishes occupy a subordinate place,
while quadrupeds, birds, and reptiles are invoked almost constantly. The
uktena (a mythic great horned serpent), the rattlesnake, and the
terrapin, the various species of hawk, and the rabbit, the squirrel, and
the dog are the principal animal gods. The importance of the god bears
no relation to the size of the animal, and in fact the larger animals
are but seldom invoked. The spider also occupies a prominent place in
the love and life-destroying formulas, his duty being to entangle the
soul of his victim in the meshes of his web or to pluck it from the body
of the doomed man and drag it way to the black coffin in the Darkening
Land.

Among what may be classed as elemental gods the principal are fire,
water, and the sun, all of which are addressed under figurative names.
The sun is called Une'\`lanû'hï, "the apportioner," just as our word
moon means originally "the measurer." Indians and Aryans alike, having
noticed how these great luminaries divide and measure day and night,
summer and winter, with never varying regularity, have given to each a
name which should indicate these characteristics, thus showing how the
human mind constantly moves on along the same channels. Missionaries
have naturally, but incorrectly, assumed this apportioner of all things
to be the suppositional "Great Spirit" of the Cherokees and hence the
word is used in the Bible translation as synonymous with God. In
ordinary conversation and in the lesser myths the sun is called

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

Nû'<sup>n</sup>tâ. The sun is invoked chiefly by the ball-player, while
the hunter prays to the fire; but every important ceremony--whether
connected with medicine, love, hunting, or the ball play--contains a
prayer to the "Long Person," the formulistic name for water, or, more
strictly speaking, for the river. The wind, the storm, the cloud, and
the frost are also invoked in different formulas.

But few inanimate gods are included in the category, the principal being
the Stone, to which the shaman prays while endeavoring to find a lost
article by means of a swinging pebble suspended by a string; the Flint,
invoked when the shaman is about to scarify the patient with a flint
arrow-head before rubbing on the medicine; and the Mountain, which is
addressed in one or two of the formulas thus far translated. Plant gods
do not appear prominently, the chief one seeming to be the ginseng,
addressed in the formulas as the "Great Man" or "Little Man," although
its proper Cherokee name signifies the "Mountain Climber."

A number of personal deities are also invoked, the principal being the
Red Man. He is one of the greatest of the gods, being repeatedly called
upon in formulas of all kinds, and is hardly subordinate to the Fire,
the Water, or the Sun. His identity is as yet uncertain, but he seems to
be intimately connected with the Thunder family. In a curious marginal
note in one of the Gahuni formulas (page 350), it is stated that when
the patient is a woman the doctor must pray to the Red Man, but when
treating a man he must pray to the Red Woman, so that this personage
seems to have dual sex characteristics. Another god invoked in the
hunting songs is Tsu'l\`kalû', or "Slanting Eyes" (see Cherokee Myths),
a giant hunter who lives in one of the great mountains of the Blue Ridge
and owns all the game. Others are the Little Men, probably the two
Thunder boys; the Little People, the fairies who live in the rock
cliffs; and even the De'tsata, a diminutive sprite who holds the place
of our Puck. One unwritten formula, which could not be obtained
correctly by dictation, was addressed to the "Red-Headed Woman, whose
hair hangs down to the ground."

The personage invoked is always selected in accordance with the theory
of the formula and the duty to be performed. Thus, when a sickness is
caused by a fish, the Fish-hawk, the Heron, or some other fish-eating
bird is implored to come and seize the intruder and destroy it, so that
the patient may find relief. When the trouble is caused by a worm or an
insect, some insectivorous bird is called in for the same purpose. When
a flock of redbirds is pecking at the vitals of the sick man the
Sparrow-hawk is brought down to scatter them, and when the rabbit, the
great mischief-maker, is the evil genius, he is driven out by the
Rabbit-hawk. Sometimes after the intruder has been thus expelled "a
small portion still remains," in the words of the formula, and
accordingly the Whirlwind is called

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

down from the treetops to carry the remnant to the uplands and there
scatter it so that it shall never reappear. The hunter prays to the
fire, from which he draws his omens; to the reed, from which he makes
his arrows; to Tsu'l\`kalû, the great lord of the game, and finally
addresses in songs the very animals which he intends to kill. The lover
prays to the Spider to hold fast the affections of his beloved one in
the meshes of his web, or to the Moon, which looks down upon him in the
dance. The warrior prays to the Red War-club, and the man about to set
out on a dangerous expedition prays to the Cloud to envelop him and
conceal him from his enemies.

Each spirit of good or evil has its distinct and appropriate place of
residence. The Rabbit is declared to live in the broomsage on the
hillside, the Fish dwells in a bend of the river under the pendant
hemlock branches, the Terrapin lives in the great pond in the West, and
the Whirlwind abides in the leafy treetops. Each disease animal, when
driven away from his prey by some more powerful animal, endeavors to
find shelter in his accustomed haunt. It must be stated here that the
animals of the formulas are not the ordinary, everyday animals, but
their great progenitors, who live in the upper world
(galû'<sup>n</sup>lati) above the arch of the firmament.
