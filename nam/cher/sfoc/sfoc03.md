# HOW THE FORMULAS WERE OBTAINED.

On first visiting the reservation in the summer of 1887, I devoted
considerable time to collecting plants used by the Cherokees for food or
medicinal purposes, learning at the same time their Indian names and the
particular uses to which each was applied and the mode of preparation.
It soon became evident that the application of the medicine was not the
whole, and in fact was rather the subordinate, part of the treatment,
which was always accompanied by certain ceremonies and "words." From the
workers employed at the time no definite idea could be obtained as to
the character of these words. One young woman, indeed, who had some
knowledge of the subject, volunteered to write the words which she used
in her prescriptions, but failed to do so, owing chiefly to the
opposition of the half-breed shamans, from whom she had obtained her
information.
