## THE GATIGWANASTI MANUSCRIPT.

Further inquiry elicited the names of several others who might be
supposed to have such papers. Before leaving a visit was paid to one of
these, a young man named Wilnoti, whose father, Gatigwanasti, had been
during his lifetime a prominent shaman, regarded as a man of superior
intelligence. Wilnoti, who is a professing Christian, said that his
father had had such papers, and after some explanation from the chief he
consented to show them. He produced a box containing a lot of
miscellaneous papers, testaments, and hymn-books, all in the Cherokee
alphabet. Among them was his father's chief treasure, a manuscript book
containing 122 pages of foolscap size, completely filled with formulas
of the same kind as those contained in Swimmer's book. There were also a
large number of loose sheets, making in all nearly 200 foolscap pages of
sacred formulas.

On offering to buy the papers, he replied that he wanted to keep them in
order to learn and practice these things himself--thus showing how thin
was the veneer of Christianity, in his case at least. On representing to
him that in a few years the new conditions would render such knowledge
valueless with the younger generation, and that even if he retained the
papers he would need some one else to explain them to him, he again
refused, saying that they might

fall into the hands of Swimmer, who, he was determined, should never see
his father's papers. Thus the negotiations came to an end for the time.

On returning to the reservation in July, 1888, another effort was made
to get possession of the Gatigwanasti manuscripts and any others of the
same kind which could be procured. By this time the Indians had had
several months to talk over the matter, and the idea had gradually
dawned upon them that instead of taking their knowledge away from them
and looking it up in a box, the intention was to preserve it to the
world and pay them for it at the same time. In addition the writer took
every opportunity to impress upon them the fact that he was acquainted
with the secret knowledge of other tribes and perhaps could give them as
much as they gave. It was now much easier to approach them, and on again
visiting Wilnoti, in company with the interpreter, who explained the
matter fully to him, he finally consented to lend the papers for a time,
with the same condition that neither Swimmer nor anyone else but the
chief and interpreter should see them, but he still refused to sell
them. However, this allowed the use of the papers, and after repeated
efforts during a period of several weeks, the matter ended in the
purchase of the papers outright, with unreserved permission to show them
for copying or explanation to anybody who might be selected. Wilnoti was
not of a mercenary disposition, and after the first negotiations the
chief difficulty was to overcome his objection to parting with his
father's handwriting, but it was an essential point to get the
originals, and he was allowed to copy some of the more important
formulas, as he found it utterly out of the question to copy the whole.

These papers of Gatigwanasti are the most valuable of the whole, and
amount to fully one-half the entire collection, about fifty pages
consisting of love charms. The formulas are beautifully written in bold
Cherokee characters, and the directions and headings are generally
explicit, bearing out the universal testimony that he was a man of
unusual intelligence and ability, characteristics inherited by his son,
who, although a young man and speaking no English, is one of the most
progressive and thoroughly reliable men of the band.
