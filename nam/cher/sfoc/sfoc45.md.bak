### SONG FOR PAINTING.

Yû'<sup>n</sup>wëhï, yû'<sup>n</sup>wëhï, yû'<sup>n</sup>wëhï,
yû'<sup>n</sup>wëhï.  
I am come from above--Yû'<sup>n</sup>wëhï, yû'<sup>n</sup>wëhï,
yû'<sup>n</sup>wëhï, yû'<sup>n</sup>wëhï.  
I am come down from the Sun Land--yû'<sup>n</sup>wëhï.

O Red Agë\`yagu'ga. you have come and put your red spittle upon my
body--Yû'<sup>n</sup>wëhï, yû'<sup>n</sup>wëhï, yû'<sup>n</sup>wëhï!.

And this above is to recite while one is painting himself.

#### Explanation.

This formula, from Gatigwanasti, immediately follows the one last given,
in the manuscript book, and evidently comes immediately after it also in
practical use. The expressions used have been already explained. The one
using the formula first bathes in the running stream, reciting at the
same time the previous formula "Amâ'yï Ä'tawasti'yï." He then repairs to
some convenient spot with his paint, beads, and other paraphernalia and
proceeds to adorn himself for the dance, which usually begins about an
hour after dark, but is not fairly under way until nearly midnight. The
refrain, yû'<sup>n</sup>wëhï, is probably *sung* while mixing the paint,
and the other portion is recited while applying the pigment, or vice
versa. Although these formula are still in use, the painting is now
obsolete, beyond an occasional daubing of the face, without any plan or
pattern, on the occasion of a dance or ball play.
