# 39. How The Kingfisher Got His Bill

Some old men say that the Kingfisher was meant in the beginning to be a
water bird, but as he had not been given either web feet or a good bill
he could not make a living. The animals held a council over it and
decided to make him a bill like a long sharp awl for a fish-gig
(fish-spear). So they made him a fish-gig and fastened it on in front of
his mouth. He flew to the top of a tree, sailed out and darted down into
the water, and came up with a fish on his gig. And he has been the best
gigger ever since.

Some others say it was this way: A Blacksnake found a Yellowhammer's

*p. 289*

nest in a hollow tree, and after swallowing the young birds, coiled up
to sleep in the nest, where the mother bird found him when she came
home. She went for help to the Little People, who sent her to the
Kingfisher. He came, and after flying back and forth past the hole a few
times, made one dart at the snake and pulled him out dead. When they
looked they found a hole in the snake's head where the Kingfisher had
pierced it with a slender *tugälû'nä* fish, which he carried in his bill
like a lance. From this the Little People concluded that he would make a
first-class gigger if he only had the right spear, so they gave him his
long bill as a reward.
