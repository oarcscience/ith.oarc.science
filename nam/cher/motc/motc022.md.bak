# 22. The Rabbit And The Possum After A Wife

The Rabbit and the Possum each wanted a wife, but no one would marry
either of them. They talked over the matter and the Rabbit said, "We
can't get wives here; let's, go to the next settlement. I'm the
messenger for the council, and I'll tell the people that I bring an
order that everybody must take a mate at once, and then we'll be sure to
get our wives."

The Possum thought this a fine plan, so they started off together to the
next town. As the Rabbit traveled faster he got there first and waited
outside until the people noticed him and took him into the townhouse.
When the chief came to ask his business the Rabbit said he brought an
important order from the council that everybody must get married without
delay. So the chief called the people together and told them the message
from the council. Every animal took a mate at once, and the Rabbit got a
wife.

The Possum traveled so slowly that he got there after all the animals
had mated, leaving him still without a wife. The Rabbit pretended to
feel sorry for him and said, "Never mind, I'll carry the message to the
people in the next settlement, and you hurry on as fast as you can, and
this time you will get your wife."

So he went on to the next town, and the Possum followed close after him.
But when the Rabbit got to the townhouse he sent out the word that, as
there had been peace so long that everybody was getting lazy the council
had ordered that there must be war at once and they must begin right in
the townhouse. So they all began fighting, but the Rabbit made four
great leaps and got away just as the Possum came in. Everybody jumped on
the Possum, who had not thought of bringing his weapons on a wedding
trip, and so could not defend himself. They had nearly beaten the life
out of him when he fell over and pretended to be dead until he saw a
good chance to jump up and get away. The Possum never got a wife, but he
remembers the lesson, and ever since he shuts his eyes and pretends to
be dead when the hunter has him in a close corner.
