# 66. U\`tlûñ'ta, The Spear-finger

Long, long ago--*hïlahi'yu*--there dwelt in the mountains a terrible
ogress, a woman monster, whose food was human livers. She could take on
any shape or appearance to suit her purpose, but in her right

*p. 317*

form she looked very much like an old woman, excepting that her whole
body was covered with a skin as hard as a rock that no weapon could
wound or penetrate, and that on her right hand she had a long, stony
forefinger of bone, like an awl or spearhead, with which she stabbed
everyone to whom she could get near enough. On account of this fact she
was called *U\`tlûñ'tä* "Spear-finger," and on account of her stony skin
she was sometimes called *Nûñ'yunu'ï*, "Stone-dress." There was another
stone-clothed monster that killed people, but that is a different story.

Spear-finger had such powers over stone that she could easily lift and
carry immense rocks, and could cement them together by merely striking
one against another. To get over the rough country more easily she
undertook to build a great rock bridge through the air from
Nûñyû'-tlu\`gûñ'yï, the "Tree rock," on Hiwassee, over to Sanigilâ'gï
(Whiteside mountain), on the Blue ridge, and had it well started from
the top of the "Tree rock" when the lightning struck it and scattered
the fragments along the whole ridge, where the pieces can still be seen
by those who go there. She used to range all over the mountains about
the heads of the streams and in the dark passes of Nantahala, always
hungry and looking for victims. Her favorite haunt on the Tennessee side
was about the gap on the trail where Chilhowee mountain comes down to
the river.

Sometimes an old woman would approach along the trail where the children
were picking strawberries or playing near the village, and would say to
them coaxingly, "Come, my grandchildren, come to your granny and let
granny dress your hair." When some little girl ran up and laid her head
in the old woman's lap to be petted and combed the old witch would
gently run her fingers through the child's hair until it went to sleep,
when she would stab the little one through the heart or back of the neck
with the long awl finger, which she had kept hidden under her robe. Then
she would take out the liver and eat it.

She would enter a house by taking the appearance of one of the family
who happened to have gone out for a short time, and would watch her
chance to stab someone with her long finger and take out his liver. She
could stab him without being noticed, and often the victim did not even
know it himself at the time--for it left no wound and caused no
pain--but went on about his own affairs, until all at once he felt weak
and began gradually to pine away, and was always sure to die, because
Spear-finger had taken his liver.

When the Cherokee went out in the fall, according to their custom, to
burn the leaves off from the mountains in order to get the chestnuts on
the ground, they were never safe, for the old witch was always on the
lookout, and as soon as she saw the smoke rise she knew there were
Indians there and sneaked up to try to surprise one alone. So as well as
they could they tried to keep together, and were very

*p. 318*

cautious of allowing any stranger to approach the camp. But if one went
down to the spring for a drink they never knew but it might be the liver
eater that came back and sat with them.

Sometimes she took her proper form, and once or twice, when far out from
the settlements, a solitary hunter had seen an old woman, with a
queer-looking hand, going through the woods singing low to herself:

Uwe'la na'tsïkû'. Su' sä' sai'.  
Liver, I eat it. Su' sa' sai'.

It was rather a pretty song, but it chilled his blood, for he knew it
was the liver eater, and he hurried away, silently, before she might see
him.

At last a great council was held to devise some means to get rid of
U\`tlûñ'tä before she should destroy everybody. The people came from all
around, and after much talk it was decided that the best way would be to
trap her in a pitfall where all the warriors could attack her at once.
So they dug a deep pitfall across the trail and covered it over with
earth and grass as if the ground had never been disturbed. Then they
kindled a large fire of brush near the trail and hid themselves in the
laurels, because they knew she would come as soon as she saw the smoke.

Sure enough they soon saw an old woman coming along the trail. She
looked like an old woman whom they knew well in the village, and
although several of the wiser men wanted to shoot at her, the other
interfered, because they did not want to hurt one of their own people.
The old woman came slowly along the trail, with one hand under her
blanket, until she stepped upon the pitfall and tumbled through the
brush top into the deep hole below. Then, at once, she showed her true
nature, and instead of the feeble old woman there was the terrible
U\`tlûñ'tä with her stony skin, and her sharp awl finger reaching out in
every direction for some one to stab.

The hunters rushed out from the thicket and surrounded the pit, but
shoot as true and as often as they could, their arrows struck the stony
mail of the witch only to be broken and fall useless at her feet, while
she taunted them and tried to climb out of the pit to get at them. They
kept out of her way, but were only wasting their arrows when a small
bird, Utsu'\`gï, the titmouse, perched on a tree overhead and began to
sing "*un, un, un.*" They thought it was saying *u'nahü'*, heart,
meaning that they should aim at the heart of the stone witch. They
directed their arrows where the heart should be, but the arrows only
glanced off with the flint heads broken.

Then they caught the Utsu'\`gï and cut off its tongue, so that ever
since its tongue is short and everybody knows it is a liar. When the
hunters let it go it flew straight up into the sky until it was out of
sight and never came back again. The titmouse that we know now is only
an image of the other.

*p. 319*

They kept up the fight without result until another bird, little
Tsï'kïlilï', the chickadee, flew down from a tree and alighted upon the
witch's right hand. The warriors took this as a sign that they must aim
there, and they were right, for her heart was on the inside of her hand,
which she kept doubled into a fist, this same awl hand with which she
had stabbed so many people. Now she was frightened in earnest, and began
to rush furiously at them with her long awl finger and to jump about in
the pit to dodge the arrows, until at last a lucky arrow struck just
where the awl joined her wrist and she fell down dead.

Ever since the tsï'kïlilï' is known as a truth teller, and when a man is
away on a journey, if this bird comes and perches near the house and
chirps its song, his friends know he will soon be safe home.
