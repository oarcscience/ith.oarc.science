# 35. The Bird Tribes

Winged creatures of all kinds are classed under the generic term of
*aninâ'hilidâ'hï* (flyers). Birds are called, alike in the singular and
plural, *tsi'skwa*, the term being generally held to exclude the
domestic fowls introduced by the whites. When it is necessary to make
the distinction they are mentioned, respectively, as *inägëhï* (living
in the

*p. 281*

woods), and *uluñni'ta* (tame). The robin is called *tsiskwa'gwä*, a
name which can not be analyzed, while the little sparrow is called
*tsikwâ'yä* (the real or principal bird), perhaps, in accord with a
principle in Indian nomenclature, on account of its wide distribution.
As in other languages, many of the bird names are onomatopes, as
*wa\`huhu'* (the screech owl), *u'guku'* (the hooting owl), *wagulï'*
(the whippoorwill), *kâgû* (the crow), *gügwë'* (the quail), *huhu* (the
yellow mocking-bird), *tsï'kïlï'* (the chickadee), *sa'sa'* (the goose).
The turtledove is called *gulë'-diska\`nihï'* (it cries for acorns), on
account of the resemblance of' it cry to the sound of the word for
acorn. (*gulë'*) The meadowlark is called *näkwïsï'* (star), on account
of the appearance of its tail when spread out as it soars. The nuthatch
(*Sitta carolinensis*) is called *tsulie'na* (deaf), and is supposed to
be without bearing, possibly on account of its fearless disregard for
man's presence. Certain diseases are diagnosed by the doctors as due to
birds, either revengeful bird ghosts, bird feathers about the house, or
bird shadows falling upon the patient from overhead.

The eagle (*awâ'hïlï*) is the great sacred bird of the Cherokee, as of
nearly all our native tribes, and figures prominently in their
ceremonial ritual, especially in all things relating to war. The
particular species prized was the golden or war eagle (*Aquila
chrsætus*), called by the Cherokee the "pretty-feathered eagle," on
account of its beautiful tail feathers, white, tipped with black, which
were in such great demand for decorative and ceremonial purposes that
among the western tribes a single tail was often rated as equal in value
to a horse. Among the Cherokee in the old times the killing of an eagle
was an event which concerned the whole settlement, and could be
undertaken only by the professional eagle killer, regularly chosen for
the purpose on account of his knowledge of the prescribed forms and the
prayers to be said afterwards in order to obtain pardon for the
necessary sacrilege, and thus ward off vengeance from the tribe. It is
told of one man upon the reservation that having deliberately killed an
eagle in defiance of the ordinances he was constantly haunted by dreams
of fierce eagles swooping down upon him, until the nightmare was finally
exercised after a long course of priestly treatment. In 1890 there was
but one eagle killer remaining among the East Cherokee. It does not
appear that the eagle was ever captured alive as among the plains
tribes.

The eagle must be killed only in the winter or late fall after the crops
were gathered and the snakes had retired to their dens. If killed in the
summertime a frost would come to destroy the corn, while the songs of
the Eagle dance, when the feathers were brought home, would so anger the
snakes that they would become doubly dangerous. Consequently the Eagle
songs were never sung until after the snakes had gone to sleep for the
winter.

When the people of a town had decided upon an Eagle dance the

*p. 282*

eagle killer was called in, frequently from a distant settlement, to
procure the feathers for the occasion. He was paid for his services from
offerings made later at the dance, and as the few professionals guarded
their secrets carefully from outsiders their business was a quite
profitable one. After some preliminary preparation the eagle killer sets
out alone for the mountains, taking with him his gun or bow and arrows.
Having reached the mountains, he goes through a vigil of prayer and
fasting, possibly lasting four days, after which he hunts until he
succeeds in killing a deer. Then, placing the body in a convenient
exposed situation upon one of the highest cliffs, he conceals himself
near by and begins to sing in a low undertone the songs to call down the
eagles from the sky. When the eagle alights upon the carcass, which will
be almost immediately if the singer understands his business, he shoots
it, and then standing over the dead bird, he addresses to it a prayer in
which he begs it not to seek vengeance upon his tribe, because it is not
a Cherokee, but a Spaniard (*Askwa'nï*) that has done the deed. The
selection of such a vicarious victim of revenge is evidence at once of
the antiquity of the prayer in its present form and of the enduring
impression which the cruelties of the early Spanish adventurers made
upon the natives.

*p. 283*

The prayer ended, he leaves the dead eagle where it fell and makes all
haste to the settlement, where the people are anxiously expecting his
return. On meeting the first warriors he says simply, "A snowbird has
died," and passes on at once to his own quarters, his work being now
finished. The announcement is made in this form in order to insure
against the vengeance of any eagles that might overhear, the little
snowbird being considered too insignificant a creature to be dreaded.

Having waited four days to allow time for the insect parasites to leave
the body, the hunters delegated for the purpose go out to bring in the
feathers. On arriving at the place they strip the body of the large tail
and wing feathers, which they wrap in a fresh deerskin brought with
them, and then return to the settlement, leaving the body of the dead
eagle upon the ground, together with that of the slain deer, the latter
being intended as a sacrifice to the eagle spirits. On reaching the
settlement, the feathers, still wrapped in the deerskin, are hung up in
a small, round hut built for this special purpose near the edge of the
dance ground (*detsänûñ'lï*) and known as the place "where the feathers
are kept," or feather house. Some settlements had two such feather
houses, one at each end of the dance ground. The Eagle dance was held on
the night of the same day on which the feathers were brought in, all the
necessary arrangements having been made beforehand. In the meantime, as
the feathers were supposed to be hungry after their journey, a dish of
venison and corn was set upon the ground below them and they were
invited to eat. The body of a flaxbird or scarlet tanager (*Piranga
rubra*) was also hung up with the feathers for the same purpose. The
food thus given to the feathers was disposed of after the dance, as
described in another place.

The eagle being regarded as a great ada'wehï, only the greatest warriors
and those versed in the sacred ordinances would dare to wear the
feathers or to carry them in the dance. Should any person in the
settlement dream of eagles or eagle feathers he must arrange for an
Eagle dance, with the usual vigil and fasting, at the first opportunity;
otherwise some one of his family will die. Should the insect parasites
which infest the feathers of the bird in life get upon a man they will
breed a skin disease which is sure to develop, even though it may be
latent for years. It is for this reason that the body of the eagle is
allowed to remain four days upon the ground before being brought into
the settlement.

The raven (*kâ'länû*) is occasionally seen in the mountains, but is not
prominent in folk belief, excepting in connection with the grewsome
tales of the Raven Mocker (q. v.). In former times its name was
sometimes assumed as a war title. The crow, so prominent in other tribal
mythologies, does not seem to appear in that of the Cherokee. Three

*p. 284*

varieties of owls are recognized, each under a different name, viz:
*tskïlï'*, the dusky horned owl (*Bubo virginianus saturatus*);
*u'guku'*, the barred or hooting owl (*Syrnium nebulosum*), and
*wa\`huhu'*, the screech owl (*Megascops asio*). The first of these
names signifies a witch, the others being onomatopes. Owls and other
night-crying birds are believed to be embodied ghosts or disguised
witches, and their cry is dreaded as a sound of evil omen. If the eyes
of a child be bathed with water in which one of the long wing or tail
feathers of an owl has been soaked, the child will be able to keep awake
all night. The feather must be found by chance, and not procured
intentionally for the purpose. On the other hand, an application of
water in which the feather of a blue jay, procured in the same way, has
been soaked will make the child an early riser.

The buzzard (*sulï'*) is said to have had a part in shaping the earth,
as was narrated in the genesis myth. It is reputed to be a doctor among
birds, and is respected accordingly, although its feathers are never
worn by ball players, for fear of becoming bald. Its own baldness is
accounted for by a vulgar story. As it thrives upon carrion and decay,
it is held to be immune from sickness, especially of a contagious
character, and a small quantity of its flesh eaten, or of the soup used
as a wash, is believed to be a sure preventive of smallpox, and was used
for this purpose during the smallpox epidemic among the East Cherokee in
1866. According to the Wahnenauhi manuscript, it is said also that a
buzzard feather placed over the cabin door will keep out witches. In
treating gunshot wounds, the medicine is blown into the wound through a
tube cut from a buzzard quill and some of the buzzard's down is
afterwards laid over the spot.

There is very little concerning hawks, excepting as regards the great
mythic hawk, the *Tlä'nuwä'*. The *tlä'nuwä' usdi'*, or "little
tlä'nuwä,") is described as a bird about as large as a turkey and of a
grayish blue color, which used to follow the flocks of wild pigeons,
flying overhead and darting down occasionally upon a victim, which it
struck and killed with its sharp breast and ate upon the wing, without
alighting. It is probably the goshawk (*Astur atricapillus*).

The common swamp gallinule, locally known as mudhen or didapper
(*Gallinula galeata*), is called *diga'gwanï'* (lame or crippled), on
account of its habit of flying only for a very short distance at a time.
In the Diga'gwanï dance the performers sing the name of the bird and
endeavor to imitate its halting movements. The *dagûl\`kû*, or
white-fronted goose (*Anser albifrons*) appears in connection with the
myth of the origin of tobacco. The feathers of the *tskwâyï*, the great
white heron or American egret (*Herodias egretta*), are worn by ball
players, and this bird probably the "swan" whose white wing was used as
a peace emblem in ancient times.

A rare bird said to have been seen occasionally upon the reservation

*p. 285*

many years ago was called by the curious name of *nûñdä-dikanï'*, "it
looks at the sun," "sun-gazer." It is described as resembling a blue
crane, and may possibly have been the *Floridus cerulea*, or little blue
heron. Another infrequent visitor, which sometimes passed over the
mountain country in company with flocks of wild geese, was the
*gu'wisguwï'*, so called from its cry. It is described as resembling a
large snipe, with yellow legs and feet unwebbed, and is thought to visit
Indian Territory at intervals. It is chiefly notable from the fact that
the celebrated chief John Ross derives his Indian name, Gu'wisguwï',
from this bird, the name being perpetuated in Cooweescoowee district of
the Cherokee Nation in the West.

Another chance visitant, concerning which there is much curious
speculation among the older men of the East Cherokee, was called
*tsun'digwûntsu'\`gï* or *tsun'digwûn'tskï*, "forked," referring to the
tail. It appeared but once, for a short season, about forty years ago,
and has not been seen since. It is said to have been pale blue, with red
in places, and nearly the size of a crow, and to have had a long forked
tail like that of a fish. It preyed upon hornets, which it took upon the
wing, and also feasted upon the larvæ in the nests. Appearing
unexpectedly and as suddenly disappearing, it was believed to be not a
bird but a transformed red-horse fish (*Moxostoma*, Cherokee *âligä'*),
a theory borne out by the red spots and the long, forked tail. It is
even maintained that about the time those birds first appeared some
hunters on Oconaluftee saw seven of them sitting on the limb of a tree
and they were still shaped like a red-horse, although they already had
wings and feathers. It was undoubtedly the scissor-tail or
swallow-tailed flycatcher (*Milvulus forficatus*), which belongs
properly in Texas and the adjacent region, but strays occasionally into
the eastern states.

On account of the red throat appendage of the turkey, somewhat
resembling the goitrous growth known in the South as "kernels"
(Cherokee, *dule'tsï*), the feathers of this bird are not worn by ball
players, neither is the neck allowed to be eaten by children or sick
persons, under the fear that a growth of "kernels" would be the result.
The meat of the ruffed grouse, locally known as the pheasant (*Bonasa
umbellus*), is tabued to a pregnant woman, because this bird hatches a
large brood, but loses most of them before maturity. Under a stricter
construction of the theory this meat is forbidden to a woman until she
is past child bearing.

The redbird, *tatsu'hwä*, is believed to have been originally the
daughter of the Sun (see the story). The huhu, or yellow mockingbird,
occurs in several stories. It is regarded as something supernatural,
possibly on account of its imitative powers, and its heart is given to
children to make them quick to learn.

The chickadee (*Parus carolinensis*), and the tufted titmouse, (*Parus
bicolor*), *utsu'\`gï*, or *u'stûtï*, are both regarded as news

*p. 286*

bringers, but the one is venerated as a truth teller while the other is
scoffed at as a lying messenger, for reasons which appear in the story
of Nûñyunu'wï (q. v.). When the *tsïkïlilï'* perches on a branch near
the house and chirps its song it is taken as an omen that an absent
friend will soon be heard from or that a secret enemy is plotting
mischief. Many stories are told in confirmation of this belief, among
which may be instanced that of Tom Starr, a former noted outlaw of the
Cherokee Nation of the West, who, on one occasion, was about to walk
unwittingly into an ambush prepared for him along a narrow trail, when
he heard the warning note of the tsïkïlilï', and, turning abruptly, ran
up the side of the ridge and succeeded in escaping with his life,
although hotly pursued by his enemies.
