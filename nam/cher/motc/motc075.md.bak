# 75. Origin Of The Bear: The Bear Songs

Long ago there was a Cherokee clan called the Ani'-Tsâ'gûhï, and in one
family of this clan was a boy who used to leave home and be gone all day
in the mountains. After a while he went oftener and stayed longer, until
at last he would not eat in the house at all, but started off at
daybreak and did not come back until night. His parents scolded, but
that did no good, and the boy, still went every day until they noticed
that long brown hair was beginning to grow out all over his body. Then
they wondered and asked him why it was that he

*p. 326*

wanted to be so much in the woods that he would not even eat at home.
Said the boy, "I find plenty to eat there, and it is better than the
corn and beans we have in the settlements, and pretty soon I am going
into the woods to stay all the time." His parents were worried and
begged him not to leave them, but he said, "It is better there than
here, and you see I am beginning to be different already, so that I can
not live here any longer. If you will come with me, there is plenty for
all of us and you will never have to work for it; but if you want to
come you must first fast seven days."

The father and mother talked it over and then told the headmen of the
clan. They held a council about the matter and after everything had been
said they decided: "Here we must work hard and have not always enough.
There he says there is always plenty without work. We will go with him."
So they fasted seven days, and on the seventh morning all the
Ani'-Tsâ'gûhï left the settlement and started for the mountains as the
boy led the way.

When the people of the other towns heard of it they were very sorry and
sent their headmen to persuade the Ani'-Tsâ'gûhï to stay at home and not
go into the woods to live. The messengers found them already on the way,
and were surprised to notice that their bodies were beginning to be
covered with hair like that of animals, because for seven days they had
not taken human food and their nature was changing. The Ani'-Tsâ'gûhï
would not come back, but said, "We are going where there is always
plenty to eat. Hereafter we shall be called *yânû* (bears), and when you
yourselves are hungry come into the woods and call us and we shall come
to give you our own flesh. You need not be afraid to kill us, for we
shall live always." Then they taught the messengers the songs with which
to call them, and the bear hunters have these songs still. When they had
finished the songs the Ani'-Tsâ'gûhï started on again and the messengers
turned back to the settlements, but after going a little way they looked
back and saw a drove of bears going into the woods.

First Bear Song

He-e! Ani'-Tsâ'gûhï, Ani'-Tsâ'gûhï, akwandu'li e'lanti' ginûn'ti,  
       Ani'-Tsâ'gûhï, Ani'-Tsâ'gûhï, akwandu'li e'lanti' ginûn'ti--Yû!

He-e! The Ani'-Tsâ'gûhï, the Ani'-Tsâ'gûhï, I want to lay them low on
the ground,  
       The Ani'-Tsâ'gûhï, the Ani'-Tsâ'gûhï, I want to lay them low on
the ground,--Yû!

The bear hunter starts out each morning fasting and does not eat until
near evening. He sings this song as he leaves camp, and again the next
morning, but never twice the same day.

Second Bear Song

This song also is sung by the bear hunter, in order to attract the
bears, while on his way from the camp to the place where he expects to
hunt during the day. The melody is simple and plaintive.

He-e! Hayuya'haniwä', hayuya'haniwä', hayuya'haniwä', hayuya'haniwä',  
       Tsistuyi' nehandu'yanû', Tsistuyi' nehandu'yanû'--Yoho-o!  
He-e! Hayuya'haniwä', hayuya'haniwä', hayuya'haniwä', hayuya'haniwä',  
       Kuwâhi' nehandu'yanû', Kuwâhi' nehandu'yanû',--Yoho-o!  
He-e! Hayuya'haniwä', hayuya'haniwä', hayuya'haniwä', hayuya'haniwä',  
       Uyâhye' nehandu'yanû', Uyâhye' nehandu'yanû',--Yoho-o!  
He-e! Hayuya'haniwä', hayuya'haniwä', hayuya'haniwä', hayuya'haniwä',  
       Gâte'gwâ' nehandu'yanû', Gâte'gwâ' nehandu'yanû',--Yoho-o!  
       (Recited)

Ûlë-\`nû' asëhï' tadeyâ'statakûhï' gûñ'näge astû' tsïkï'

He! Hayuya'haniwä' (four times),  
     In Tsistu'yï you were conceived (two times)--Yoho!  
He! Hayuya'haniwä' (four times),  
     In Kuwâ'hï you were conceived (two times)--Yoho!  
He! Hayuya'haniwä' (four times),  
     In Uyâ'hye you were conceived (two times)--Yoho!  
He! Hayuya'haniwä' (four times),  
     In Gâte'gwâ you were conceived (two times)--Yoho!  
And now surely we and the good black things, the best of all, shall see
each other.
