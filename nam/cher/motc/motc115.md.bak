# 115. The Two Old Men

Two old men went hunting. One had an eye drawn down and was called
Uk-kwûnägi'ta, "Eye-drawn-down." The other had an arm twisted out of
shape and was called Uk-ku'sûñtsûtï, "Bent-bow-shape." They killed a
deer and cooked the meat in a pot. The second old man dipped a piece of
bread into the soup and smacked his lips as he ate it. "Is it good?"
said the first old man. Said the other, "*Hayû'! uk-kwûnägi'stï*--Yes,
sir! It will draw down one's eye."

Thought the first old man to himself, "He means me." So he dipped a
piece of bread into the pot, and smacked his lips as he tasted it. "Do
you find it good?" said the other old man. Said his comrade, "Hayû!
uk-ku'sûñtsûtëtï'--Yes, sir! It will twist up one's arm." Thought the
second old man, "He means me"; so he got very angry and struck the first
old man, and then they fought until each killed the other.
