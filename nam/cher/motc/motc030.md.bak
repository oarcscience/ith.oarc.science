# 30. Why The Mole Lives Underground

A man was in love with a woman who disliked him and would have nothing
to do with him. He tried every way to win her favor, but to no purpose,
until at last he grew discouraged and made himself sick thinking over
it. The Mole came along, and finding him in such low condition asked
what was the trouble. The man told him the whole story, and when he had
finished the Mole said: "I can help you, so that she will not only like
you, but will come to you of her own will."

*p. 278*

So that night the Mole burrowed his way underground to where the girl
was in bed asleep and took out her heart. He came back by the same way
and gave the heart to the man, who could not see it even when it was put
into his hand. "There," said the Mole, "swallow it, and she will be
drawn to come to you and can not keep away." The man swallowed the
heart, and when the girl woke up she somehow thought at once of him, and
felt a strange desire to be with him, as though she must go to him at
once. She wondered and could not understand it, because she had always
disliked him before, but at last the feeling grew so strong that she was
compelled to go herself to the man and tell him she loved him and wanted
to be his wife. And so they were married, but all the magicians who had
known them both were surprised and wondered how it had come about. When
they found that it was the work of the Mole, whom they had always before
thought too insignificant for their notice, they were very jealous and
threatened to kill him, so that he hid himself under the ground and has
never since dared to come up to the surface.
