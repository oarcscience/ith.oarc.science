# 53. The Hunter And The Uksu'hï

A man living down in Georgia came to visit some relatives at
Hickory-log. He was a great hunter, and after resting in the house a day
or two got ready to go into the mountains. His friends warned him not to
go toward the north, as in that direction, near a certain large uprooted
tree, there lived a dangerous monster uksu'hï snake. It kept constant
watch, and whenever it could spring upon an unwary hunter it would coil
about him and crush out his life in its folds and then drag the dead
body down the mountain side into a deep hole in Hiwassee.

He listened quietly to the warning, but all they said only made him the
more anxious to see such a monster, so, without saying anything of his
intention, he left the settlement and took his way directly up the
mountain toward the north. Soon he came to the fallen tree and climbed
upon the trunk, and there, sure enough, on the other side was the great
uksu'hï stretched out in the grass, with its head raised, but looking
the other way. It was about so large \[making a circle of a foot in
diameter with his hands\]. The frightened hunter got down again at once
and started to run; but the snake had heard the noise and turned quickly
and was after him. Up the ridge the hunter ran, the snake close behind
him, then down the other side toward the river. With all his running the
uksu'hi gained rapidly, and just as he reached the low ground it caught
up with him and wrapped around him, pinning one arm down by his side,
but leaving the other free.

Now it gave him a terrible squeeze that almost broke his ribs, and then
began to drag him along toward the water. With his free hand

the hunter clutched at the bushes as they passed, but the snake turned
its head and blew its sickening breath into his face until he had to let
go his hold. Again and again this happened, and all the time they were
getting nearer to a deep hole in the river, when, almost at the last
moment, a lucky thought came into the hunter's mind.

He was sweating all over from his hard run across the mountain, and
suddenly remembered to have heard that snakes can not bear the smell of
perspiration. Putting his free hand into his bosom he worked it around
under his armpit until it was covered with perspiration. Then
withdrawing it he grasped at a bush until the snake turned its head,
when he quickly slapped his sweaty hand on its nose. The uksu'hi cave
one gasp almost as if it had been wounded, loosened its coil, and glided
swiftly away through the bushes, leaving the hunter, bruised but not
disabled, to make his way home to Hickory-log.
