# 44. The Owl Gets Married

A widow with one daughter was always warning the girl that she must be
sure to get a good hunter for a husband when she married. The young
woman listened and promised to do as her mother advised. At last a
suitor came to ask the mother for the girl, but the widow told him that
only a good hunter could have her daughter. "I'm just that kind," said
the lover, and again asked her to speak for him to the young woman. So
the mother went to the girl and told her a young man had come
a-courting, and as he said he was a good hunter she advised her daughter
to take him. "Just as you say," said the girl. So when he came again the
matter was all arranged, and he went to live with the girl.

The next morning he got ready and said he would go out hunting, but
before starting he changed his mind and said he would go fishing. He was
gone all day and came home late at night, bringing only three small
fish, saying that he had had no luck, but would have better success
to-morrow. The next morning he started off again to fish and was gone
all day, but came home at night with only two worthless spring lizards
(*duwë'gä*) and the same excuse. Next day he said he would go hunting
this time. He was gone again until night, and

*p. 292*

returned at last with only a handful of scraps that he had found where
some hunters had cut up a deer.

By this time the old woman was suspicious. So next morning when he
started off again, as he said, to fish, she told her daughter to follow
him secretly and see how he set to work. The girl followed through the
woods and kept him in sight until he came down to the river, where she
saw her husband change to a hooting owl (*uguku'*) and fly over to a
pile of driftwood in the water and cry, "*U-gu-ku! hu! hu! u! u!*" She
was surprised and very angry and said to herself, "I thought I had
married a man, but my husband is only an owl." She watched and saw the
owl look into the water for a long time and at last swoop down and bring
up in his claws a handful of sand, from which he picked out a crawfish.
Then he flew across to the bank, took the form of a man again, and
started home with the crawfish. His wife hurried on ahead through the
woods and got there before him. When he came in with the crawfish in his
hand, she asked him where, were all the fish he had caught. He said he
had none, because an owl had frightened them all away. "I think you are
the owl," said his wife, and drove him out of the house. The owl went
into the woods and there he pined away with grief and love until there
was no flesh left on any part of his body except his head.
