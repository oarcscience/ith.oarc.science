# 112. The Ignorant Housekeeper

An old man whose wife had died lived alone with his son. One day he said
to the young man, "We need a cook here, so you would better get
married." So the young man got a wife and brought her home. Then his
father said, "Now we must work together and do all we can to help her.
You go hunting and bring in the meat and I'll look after the corn and
beans, and then she can cook." The young man went into the woods to look
for a deer and his father went out into the field to attend to the corn.
When they came home at night they were hungry, and the young woman set
out a bowl of walnut hominy (*kanâ'talu'hï*) before them. It looked
queer, somehow, and when the old man examined it he found that the
walnuts had been put in whole. "Why didn't you shell the walnuts and
then beat up the kernels," said he to the young woman. "I didn't know
they had to be shelled," she replied. Then the old. man said, "You think
about marrying and you don't know how to cook," and he sent her away.
