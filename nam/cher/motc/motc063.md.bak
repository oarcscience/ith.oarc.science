# 63. Ûñtsaiyï', The Gambler

Thunder lives in the west, or a little to the south of west, near the
place where the sun goes down behind the water. In the old times he
sometimes made a journey to the east, and once after he had come back
from one of these journeys a child was born in the east who, the people
said, was his son. As the boy grew up it was found that he had scrofula
sores all over his body, so one day his mother said to him, "Your
father, Thunder, is a great doctor. He lives far in the west, but if you
can find him he can cure you."

So the boy set out to find his father and be cured. He traveled long
toward the west, asking of every one he met where Thunder lived, until
at last they began to tell him that it was only a little way ahead. He
went on and came to Ûñtiguhï', on Tennessee, where lived Ûñtsaiyï'
"Brass." Now a Ûñtsaiyï' was a great gambler, and made his living that
way. It was he who invented the *gatayûstï* game that we play with a
stone wheel and a stick. He lived on the south side of the river, and
everybody who came that way he challenged to play against him. The large
flat rock, with the lines and grooves where they used to roll the wheel,
is still there, with the wheels themselves and the stick turned to
stone. He won almost every time, because he was so tricky, so that he
had his house filled with all kinds of fine things. Sometimes he would
lose, and then he would bet all that he had, even to his own life, but
the winner got nothing for his trouble, for Ûñtsaiyï' knew how to take
on different shapes, so that he always got away.

*p. 312*

As soon as Ûñtsaiyï' saw him he asked him to stop and play a while, but
the boy said he was looking for his father, Thunder, and had no time to
wait. "Well," said Ûñtsaiyï', "he lives in the next house; you can hear
him grumbling over there all the time"--he meant the Thunder--"so we may
as well have a game or two before you go on." The boy said he had
nothing to bet. "That's all right," said the gambler, "we'll play for
your pretty spots." He said this to make the boy angry so that he would
play, but still the boy said he must go first and find his father, and
would come back afterwards.

He went on, and soon the news came to Thunder that a boy was looking for
him who claimed to be his son. Said Thunder, "I have traveled in many
lands and have many children. Bring him here and we shall soon know." So
they brought in the boy, and Thunder showed him a seat and told him to
sit down. Under the blanket on the seat were long, sharp thorns of the
honey locust, with the points all sticking up, but when the boy sat down
they did not hurt him, and then Thunder knew that it was his son. He
asked the boy why he had come. "I have sores all over my body, and my
mother told me you were my father and a great doctor, and if I came here
you would cure me. "Yes," said his father, "I am a great doctor, and
I'll soon fix you."

There was a large pot in the corner and he told his wife to fill it with
water and put it over the fire. When it was boiling, he put in some
roots, then took the boy and put him in with them. He let it boil a long
time until one would have thought that the flesh was boiled from the
poor boy's bones, and then told his wife to take the pot and throw it
into the river, boy and all. She did as she was told, and threw it into
the water, and ever since there is an eddy there that we call
Ûñ'tiguhï', "Pot-in-the-water." A service tree and a calico bush grew on
the bank above. A great cloud of steam came up and made streaks and
blotches on their bark, and it has been so to this day. When the steam
cleared away she looked over and saw the boy clinging to the roots of
the service tree where they hung down into the water, but now his skin
was all clean. She helped him up the bank, and they went back to the
house. On the way she told him, "When we go in, your father will put a
new dress on you, but when he opens his box and tells you to pick out
your ornaments be sure to take them from the bottom. Then he will send
for his other sons to play ball against you. There is a honey-locust
tree in front of the house, and as soon as you begin to get tired strike
at that and your father will stop the play, because he does not want to
lose the tree."

When they went into the house, the old man was pleased to see the boy
looking so clean, and said, "I knew I could soon cure those spots. Now
we must dress you." He brought out a fine suit of buck-kin, with belt
and headdress, and had the boy put them on. Then he opened a box and
said, "Now pick out your necklace and bracelets."

*p. 312*

The boy looked, and the box was full of all kinds of snakes gliding over
each other with their heads up. He was not afraid, but remembered what
the woman had told him, and plunged his hand to the bottom and drew out
a great rattlesnake and put it around his neck for a necklace. He put
down his hand again four times and drew up four copperheads and twisted
them around his wrists and ankles. Then his father gave him a war club
and said, "Now you must play a ball game with your two elder brothers.
They live beyond here in the Darkening land, and l have sent for them"
He said a ball game, but he meant that the boy must fight for his life.
The young men came, and they were both older and stronger than the boil,
but he was not afraid and fought against them. The thunder rolled and
the lightning flashed at every stroke, for they were the young Thunders,
and the boy himself was Lightning. At last he was tired from defending
himself alone against two, and pretended to aim a blow at the
honey-locust tree. Then his father stopped the fight, because he was
afraid the lightning would split the tree, and he saw that the boy was
brave and strong.

The boy told his father how Ûñtsaiyï' had dared him to play, and had
even offered to play for the spots on his skin. "Yes," said Thunder, "he
is a great gambler and makes his living that way, but I will see that
you win." He brought a small cymling gourd with a hole bored through the
neck, and tied it on the boy's wrist. Inside the gourd there was a
string of beads, and one end hung out from a hole in the top, but there
was no end to the string inside. "Now," said his father, :go back the
way you came, and as soon as he sees you he will want to play for the
beads. He is very hard to beat, but this time he will lose every game.
When he cries out for a drink, you will know he is getting discouraged,
and then strike the rock with your war club and water will come, so that
you can play on without stopping. At last he will bet his life, and
lose. Then send at once for your brothers to kill him, or he will get
away, he is so tricky."

The boy took the gourd and his war club and started east along the road
by which he had come. As soon as Ûñtsai'yï saw him he called to him, and
when he saw the gourd with the bead string hanging out he wanted to play
for it. The boy drew out the string. but there seemed to be no end to
it, and he kept on pulling until enough had come out to make a circle
all around the playground. "I will play one game for this much against
your stake," said the boy, "and when that is over we can have another
game."

They began the game with the wheel and stick and the boy won. Ûñtsai'yï
did not know what to think of it, but he put up another stake and called
for a second game. The boy won again, and so they played on until noon,
when Ûñtsai'yï had lost nearly everything he had and was about
discouraged. It was very hot, and he said, "I am

*p. 314*

thirsty," and wanted to stop long enough to get a drink. "No," said the
boy, and struck the rock with his club so that water came out, and they
had a drink. They played on until Ûñtsai'yï had lost all his buckskins
and beaded work, his eagle feathers and ornaments, and at last offered
to bet his wife. They played and the boy won her. Then Ûñtsai'yï was
desperate and offered to stake his life. "If I win I kill you, but if
you win you may kill me." They played and the boy won.

"Let me go and tell my wife," said Ûñtsai'yï, "so that she will receive
her new husband, and then you may kill me." He went into the house, but
it had two doors, and although the boy waited long Ûñtsai'yï did not
come back. When at last he went to look for him he found that the
gambler had gone out the back way and was nearly out of sight going
east.

The boy ran to his father's house and got his brothers to help him. They
brought their dog--the Horned Green Beetle--and hurried after the
gambler. He ran fast and was soon out of sight, and they followed as
fast as they could. After a while they met an old woman making pottery
and asked her if she had seen Ûñtsai'yï and she said she had not. "He
came this way," said the brothers. "Then he must have passed in the
night," said the old woman, "for I have been here all day." They were
about to take another road when the Beetle, which had been circling
about in the air above the old woman, made a dart at her and struck her
on the forehead, and it rang like brass--*ûñtsai'yï!* Then they knew it
was Brass and sprang at him, but he jumped up in his right shape and was
off, running so fast that he was soon out of sight again. The Beetle had
struck so hard that some of the brass rubbed off, and we can see it on
the beetle's forehead yet.

They followed and came to an old man sitting by the trail, carving a
stone pipe. They asked him if he had seen Brass pass that way and he
said no, but again the Beetle--which could know Brass under any
shape--struck him on the forehead so that it rang like metal, and the
gambler jumped up in his right form and was off again before they could
hold him. He ran east until he came to the great water; then he ran
north until he came to the edge of the world, and had to turn again to
the west. He took every shape to throw them off the track, but the Green
Beetle always knew him, and the brothers pressed him so hard that at
last he could go no more and they caught him just as he reached the edge
of the great water where the sun goes down.

They tied his hands and feet with a grapevine and drove a long stake
through his breast, and planted it far out in the deep water. They set
two crows on the end of the pole to guard it and called the place
*Kâgûñ'yï*, "Crow place." But Brass never died, and cannot die until the
end of the world, but lies there always with his face up. Sometimes he
struggles under the water to get free, and sometimes the beavers, who
are his friends, come and gnaw at the grapevine to

*p. 315*

release him. Then the pole shakes and the crows at the top cry *Ka! Ka!
Ka!* and scare the beavers away.
