# 42. The Pheasant Beating Corn; Origin Of The Pheasant Dance

The Pheasant once saw a woman beating corn in a wooden mortar in front
of the house. "I can do that, too," said he, but the woman would not
believe it, so the Pheasant went into the woods and got upon a hollow
log and "drummed" with his wings as a pheasant does, until the people in
the house heard him and thought he was really beating corn.

In the Pheasant dance, a part of the Green-corn dance, the instrument
used is the drum, and the dancers beat the ground with their feet in
imitation of the drumming sound made by the pheasant. They form two
concentric circles, the men being on the inside, facing the women in the
outer circle, each in turn advancing and retreating at the signal of the
drummer, who sits at one side and sings the Pheasant songs. According to
the story, there was once a winter famine among the birds and animals.
No mast (fallen nuts) could be found in the woods, and they were near
starvation when a Pheasant discovered a holly tree, loaded with red
berries, of which the Pheasant is said to be particularly fond. He
called his companion birds, and they formed a circle about the tree,
singing, dancing, and drumming with their wings in token of their joy,
and thus originated the Pheasant dance.
