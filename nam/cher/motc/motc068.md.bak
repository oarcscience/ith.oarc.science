# 68. The Hunter In The Däkwä'

In the old days there was a great fish called the Däkwä', which lived in
Tennessee river where Toco creek comes in at Däkwä', the "Däkwä' place,"
above the mouth of Tellico, and which was so large that it could easily
swallow a man. Once a canoe filled with warriors was crossing over from
the town to the other side of the river, when the Däkwä' suddenly rose
up under the boat and threw them all into the air. As they came down it
swallowed one with a single snap of its jaws and dived with him to the
bottom of the river. As soon as the hunter came to his senses he found
that he had not been hurt, but it was so hot and close inside the Däkwä'
that he was nearly smothered. As he groped around in the dark his band
struck a lot of mussel shells

which the fish had swallowed, and taking one of these for a knife he
began to out his way out, until soon the fish grew uneasy at the
scraping inside his stomach and came up to the top of the water for air.
He kept on cutting until the fish was in such pain that it swam this way
and that across the stream and thrashed the water into foam with its
tail. Finally the hole was so large that he could look out and saw that
the Däkwä' was now resting in shallow water near the shore. Reaching up
he climbed out from the side of the fish, moving very carefully so that
the Däkwä' would not know it, and then waded to shore and got back to
the settlement, but the juices in the stomach of the great fish had
scalded all the hair from his head and he was bald ever after.

#### WAHNENAUHI VERSION

A boy was sent on an errand by his father, and not wishing to go he ran
away to the river. After playing in the sand for a short time some boys
of his acquaintance came by in a canoe and invited him to, join them.
Glad of the opportunity to get away he went with them, but had no sooner
got in than the canoe began to tip and rock most unaccountably. The boys
became very much frightened, and in the confusion the bad boy fell into
the water and was immediately swallowed by a large fish. After lying in
its stomach for some time he became very hungry, and on looking around
he saw the fish's liver hanging over his head. Thinking it dried meat,
he tried to cut off a piece with a mussel shell he had been playing with
and still held in his hand. The operation sickened the fish and it
vomited the boy.
