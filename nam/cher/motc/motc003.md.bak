# 3. Kana'tï And Selu: The Origin Of Game And Corn

When I was a boy this is what the old men told me they had heard when
they were boys.

Long years ago, soon after the world was made, a hunter and his wife
lived at Pilot knob with their only child, a little boy. The father's
name was Kana'tï (The Lucky Hunter), and his wife was called Selu
(Corn). No matter when Kana'tï went into the wood, he never failed to
bring back a load of game, which his wife. would cut up and prepare,
washing off the blood from the meat in the river near the house. The
little boy used to play down by the river every day, and one morning the
old people thought they heard laughing and talking in the bushes as
though there were two children there. When the boy came home at night
his parents asked him who had been playing with him all day. "He comes
out of the water," said the boy, "and he calls himself my elder brother.
He says his mother was cruel to him and threw him into the river." Then
they knew that the strange boy had sprung from the blood of the game
which Selu had washed off at the river's edge.

Every day when the little boy went out to play the other would join him,
but as he always went back again into the water the old people never had
a chance to see him. At last one evening Kana'tï said to his son,
"Tomorrow, when the other boy comes to play, get him to wrestle with
you, and when you have your arms around him hold on to him and call for
us." The boy promised to do as he was told, so the next day as soon as
his playmate appeared he challenged him to a wrestling match. The other
agreed at once, but as soon as they had their arms around each other,
Kana'tï's boy began to scream for his father. The old folks at once came
running down, and as soon as the Wild Boy saw them he struggled to free
himself and cried out, "Let me go; you threw me away!" but his brother
held on until the parents reached the spot, when they seized the Wild
Boy and took him home with them. They kept him in the house until they
had tamed him, but he was always wild and artful in his disposition, and
was the leader of his brother in every mischief. It was not long until
the old people discovered that he had magic powers, and they called him
I'näge-utäsûñ'hï (He-who-grew-up-wild).

Whenever Kana'tï went into the mountains he always brought back a fat
buck or doe, or maybe a couple of turkeys. One day the Wild Boy said to
his brother, "I wonder where our father gets all that game; let's follow
him next time and find out." A few days afterward Kana'tï took a bow and
some feathers in his hand and started off

*p. 243*

toward the west. The boys waited a little while and then went after him,
keeping out of sight until they saw him go into a swamp where there were
a great many of the small reeds that hunters use to make arrowshafts.
Then the Wild Boy changed himself into a puff of bird's down, which the
wind took up and carried until it alighted upon Kana'tï's shoulder just
as he entered the swamp, but Kana'tï' knew nothing about it. The old man
cut reeds, fitted the feathers to them and made some arrows, and the
Wild Boy--in his other shape--thought, "I wonder what those things are
for?" When Kana'tï had his arrows finished he came out of the swamp and
went on again. The wind blew the down from his shoulder, and it fell in
the woods, when the Wild Boy took his right shape again and went back
and told his brother what he had seen. Keeping out of sight of their
father, they followed him up the mountain until he stopped at a certain
place and lifted a large rock. At once there ran out a buck, which
Kana'tï shot, and then lifting it upon his back he started for home
again. "Oho!" exclaimed the boys, "he keeps all the deer shut up in that
hole, and whenever he wants meat he just lets one out and kills it with
those things he made in the swamp." They hurried and reached home before
their father, who had the heavy deer to carry, and he never knew that
they had followed.

A few days later the boys went back to the swamp, cut some reeds, and
made seven arrows and then started up the mountain to where their father
kept the game. When they got to the place, they raised the rock and a
deer came running out. Just as they drew back to shoot it, another came
out, and then another and another, until the boys got confused and
forgot what they were about. In those days all the deer had their tails
hanging down like other animals, but as a buck was running past the Wild
Boy struck its tail with his arrow so that it pointed upward. The boys
thought this good sport, and when the next one ran past the Wild Boy
struck its tail so that it stood straight up, and his brother struck the
next one so hard with his arrow that the deer's tail was almost curled
over his back. The deer carries his tail this way ever since. The deer
came running past until the last one had come out of the hole and
escaped into the forest. Then came droves of raccoons, rabbits, and all
the other four-footed animals-all but the bear, because there was no
bear then. Last came great flocks of turkeys, pigeons, and partridges
that darkened the air like a cloud and made such a noise with their
wings that Kana'tï, sitting at home, heard the sound like distant
thunder on the mountains and said to himself, "My bad boys have got into
trouble; I must go and see what they are doing."

So he went up the mountain, and when he came to the place where he kept
the game he found the two boys standing by the rock, and all the birds
and animals were gone. Kana'tï was furious, but without

*p. 244*

saying a word he went down into the cave and kicked the covers off four
jars in one corner, when out swarmed bedbugs, fleas, lice, and gnats,
and got all over the boys. They screamed with pain and fright and tried
to beat off the insects, but the thousands of vermin crawled over them
and bit and stung them until both dropped down nearly dead. Kana'tï
stood looking on until he thought they had been punished enough, when he
knocked off the vermin and made the boys a talk. "Now, you rascals,"
said he, "you have always had plenty to eat and never had to work for
it. Whenever you were hungry all I had to do was to come up here and get
a deer or a turkey and bring it home for your mother to cook; but now
you have let out all the animals, and after this when you want a deer to
eat you will have to hunt all over the woods for it, and then maybe not
find one. Go home now to your mother, while I see if I can find
something to eat for supper."

When the boys got home again they were very tired and hungry and asked
their mother for something to eat. "There is no meat," said Selu, "but
wait a little while and I'll get you something." So she took a basket
and started out to the storehouse. This storehouse was built upon poles
high up from the ground, to keep it out of the reach of animals, and
there was a ladder to climb up by, and one door, but no other opening.
Every day when Selu got ready to cook the dinner she would go out to the
storehouse with a basket and bring it back full of corn and beans. The
boys had never been inside the storehouse, so wondered where all the
corn and beans could come from, as the house was not a very large one;
so as soon as Selu went out of the door the Wild Boy said to his
brother, "Let's go and see what she does." They ran around and climbed
up at the back of the storehouse and pulled out a piece of clay from
between the logs, so that they could look in. There they saw Selu
standing in the middle of the room with the basket in front of her on
the floor. Leaning over the basket, she rubbed her stomach--*so*--and
the basket was half full of corn. Then she rubbed under her
armpits--*so*--and the basket was full to the top with beans. The boys
looked at each other and said, "This will never do; our mother is a
witch. If we eat any of that it will poison us. We must kill her."

When the boys came back into the house, she knew their thoughts before
they spoke. "So you are going to kill me?" said Selu. "Yes," said the
boys, "you are a witch." "Well," said their mother, "when you have
killed me, clear a large piece of ground in front of the house and drag
my body seven times around the circle. Then drag me seven times over the
ground inside the circle, and stay up all night and watch, and in the
morning you will have plenty of corn." The boys killed her with their
clubs, and cut off her head and put it up on the roof of the house with
her face turned to the west, and told her to look for her husband. Then
they set to work to clear the ground in front of the

*p. 245*

house, but instead of clearing the whole piece they cleared only seven
little spots. This is why corn now grows only in a few places instead of
over the whole world. They dragged the body of Selu around the circle,
and wherever her blood fell on the ground the corn sprang up. But
instead of dragging her body seven times across the ground they dragged
it over only twice, which is the reason the Indians still work their
crop but twice. The two brothers sat up and watched their corn all
night, and in the morning it was full grown and ripe.

When Kana'tï came home at last, he looked around, but could not see Selu
anywhere, and asked the boys where was their mother. "She was a witch,
and we killed her," said the boys; "there is her head up there on top of
the house." When he saw his wife's head on the roof, he was very angry,
and said, "I won't stay with you any longer; I am going to the Wolf
people." So he started off, but before he had gone far the Wild Boy
changed himself again to a tuft of down, which fell on Kana'tï's
shoulder. When Kana'tï reached the settlement of the Wolf people, they
were holding a council in the townhouse. He went in and sat down with
the tuft of bird's down on his shoulder, but he never noticed it. When
the Wolf chief asked him his business, he said: "I have two bad boys at
home, and I want you to go in seven days from now and play ball against
them." Although Kana'tï spoke as though he wanted them to play a game of
ball, the Wolves knew that he meant for them to go and kill the two
boys. They promised to go. Then the bird's down blew off from Kana'tï's
shoulder, and the smoke carried it up through the hole in the roof of
the townhouse. When it came down on the ground outside, the Wild Boy
took his right shape again and went home and told his brother all that
he had heard in the townhouse. But when Kana'tï left the Wolf people, he
did not return home, but went on farther.

The boys then began to get ready for the Wolves, and the Wild Boy--the
magician--told his brother what to do. They ran around the house in a
wide circle until they had made a trail all around it excepting on the
side from which the Wolves would come, where they left a small open
space. Then they made four large bundles of arrows and placed them at
four different points on the outside of the circle, after which they hid
themselves in the woods and waited for the Wolves. In a day or two a
whole party of Wolves came and surrounded the house to kill the boys.
The Wolves did not notice the trail around the house, because they came
in where the boys had left the opening, but the moment they went inside
the circle the trail changed to a high brush fence and shut them in.
Then the boys on the outside took their arrows and began shooting them
down, and as the Wolves could not jump over the fence they were all
killed, excepting a few that escaped through the opening into a great
swamp close by. The boys ran around the swamp, and a circle of fire
sprang up in their

*p. 246*

tracks and set fire to the grass and bushes and burned up nearly all the
other wolves. Only two or three got away, and from these have come all
the wolves that are now in the world.

Soon afterward some strangers from a distance, who had heard that the
brothers had a wonderful grain from which they made bread, came to ask
for some, for none but Selu and her family had ever known corn before.
The boys gave them seven grains of corn, which they told them to plant
the next night on their way home, sitting up all night to watch the
corn, which would have seven ripe ears in the morning. These they were
to plant the next night and watch in the same way, and so on every night
until they reached home, when they would have corn enough to supply the
whole people. The strangers lived seven days' journey away. They took
the seven grains and watched all through the darkness until morning,
when they saw seven tall stalks, each stalk bearing a ripened ear. They
gathered the ears and went on their way. The next night they planted all
their corn, and guarded it as before until daybreak, when they found an
abundant increase. But the way was long and the sun was hot, and the
people grew tired. On the last night before reaching home they fell
asleep, and in the morning the corn they had planted had not even
sprouted. They brought with them to their settlement what corn they had
left and planted it, and with care and attention were able to raise a
crop. But ever since the corn must be watched and tended through half
the year, which before would grow and ripen in a night.

As Kana'tï did not return, the boys at last concluded to go and find
him. The Wild Boy took a gaming wheel and rolled it toward the Darkening
land. In a little while the wheel came rolling back, and the boys knew
their father was not there. He rolled it to the south and, to the north,
and each time the wheel came back to him, and they knew their father was
not there. Then he rolled it toward the Sunland, and it did not return.
"Our father is there," said the Wild Boy, "let us go and find him." So
the two brothers set off toward the east, and after traveling a long
time they came upon Kana'tï walking along with a little dog by his side.
"You bad boys," said their father, "have you come here? "Yes," they
answered, "we always accomplish what we start out to do--we are men."
"This dog overtook me four days ago," then said Kana'tï, but the boys
knew that the dog was the wheel which they had sent after him to find
him. "Well," said Kana'tï, "as you have found me, we may as well travel
together, but I shall take the lead."

Soon they came to a swamp, and Kana'tï told them there was something
dangerous there and they must keep away from it. He went on ahead, but
as soon as he was out of sight the Wild Boy said to his brother, "Come
and let us see what is in the swamp." They went in together, and in the
middle of the swamp they found a large

*p. 247*

panther asleep. The Wild Boy got out an arrow and shot the panther in
the side of the head. The panther turned his head and the other boy shot
him on that side. He turned his head away again and the two brothers
shot together--*tust, tust, tust!* But the panther was not hurt by the
arrows and paid no more attention to the boys. They came out of the
swamp and soon overtook Kana'tï, waiting for them. "Did you find it?"
asked Kana'tï. "Yes," said the boys, "we found it, but it never hurt us.
We are men." Kana'tï was surprised, but said nothing, and they went on
again.

After a while he turned to them and said, "Now you must be careful. We
are coming to a tribe called the Anäda'dûñtäskï. ("Roasters," i.e.,
cannibals), and if they get you they will put you into a pot and feast
on you." Then he went on ahead. Soon the boys came to a tree which had
been struck by lightning, and the Wild Boy directed his brother to
gather some of the splinters from the tree and told him what to do with
them. In a little while they came to the settlement of the cannibals,
who, as soon as they saw the boys, came running out, crying, "Good, here
are two nice fat strangers. Now we'll have a grand feast!" They caught
the boys and dragged them into the townhouse, and sent word to all the
people of the settlement to come to the feast. They made up a great
fire, put water into a large pot and set it to boiling, and then seized
the Wild Boy and put him down into it. His brother was not in the least
frightened and made no attempt to escape, but quietly knelt down and
began putting the splinters into the fire, as if to make it burn better.
When the cannibals thought the meat was about ready they lifted the pot
from the fire, and that instant a blinding light filled the townhouse,
and the lightning began to dart from one side to the other, striking
down the cannibals until not one of them was left alive. Then the
lightning went up through the smokehole, and the next moment there were
the two boys standing outside the townhouse as though nothing had
happened. They went on and soon met Kana'tï, who seemed much surprised
to see them, and said, "What! are you here again?" "O, yes, we never
give up. We are great men!" "What did the cannibals do to you?" "We met
them and they brought us to their townhouse, but they never hurt us."
Kana'tï said nothing more, and they went on.

\*    \*    \*    \*    \*    \*    \*

He soon got out of sight of the boys, but they kept on until they came
to the end of the world, where the sun comes out. The sky was just
coming down when they got there, but they waited until it went up again,
and then they went through and climbed up on the other side. There they
found Kana'tï and Selu sitting together. The old folk received them
kindly and were glad to see them, telling them they might stay there a
while, but then they must go to live where the sun goes down. The boys
stayed with their parents seven days and

*p. 248*

then went on toward the Darkening land, where they are now. We call them
Anisga'ya Tsunsdi' (The Little Men), and when they talk to each other we
hear low rolling thunder in the west.

After Kana'tï's boys had let the deer out from the cave where their
father used to keep them, the hunters tramped about in the woods for a
long time without finding any game, so that the people were very hungry.
At last they heard that the Thunder Boys were now living in the far
west, beyond the sun door, and that if they were sent for they could
bring back the game. So they sent messengers for them, and the boys came
and sat down in the middle of the townhouse and began to sing.

At the first song there was a roaring sound like a strong wind in the
northwest, and it grew louder and nearer as the boys sang on, until at
the seventh song a whole herd of deer, led by a large buck, came out
from the woods. The boys had told the people to be ready with their bows
and arrows, and when the song was ended and all the deer were close
around the townhouse, the hunters shot into them and killed as many as
they needed before the herd could get back into the timber.

Then the Thunder Boys went back to the Darkening land, but before they
left they taught the people the seven songs with which to call up the
deer. It all happened so long ago that the songs are now forgotten--all
but two, which the hunters still sing whenever they go after deer.

#### WAHNENAUHI VERSION

After the world had been brought up from under the water, "They then
made a man and a woman and led them around the edge of the island. On
arriving at the starting place they planted some corn, and then told the
man and woman to go around the way they had been led. This they did, and
on returning they found the corn up and growing nicely. They were then
told to continue the circuit. Each trip consumed more time. At last the
corn was ripe and ready for use."

\*    \*    \*    \*    \*    \*    \*

Another story is told of how sin came into the world. A man and a woman
reared a large family of children in comfort and plenty, with very
little trouble about providing food for them. Every morning the father
went forth and very soon returned bringing with him a deer, or a turkey,
or some other animal or fowl. At the same time the mother went out and
soon returned with a large basket filled with ears of corn which she
shelled and pounded in a mortar, thus making meal for bread.

When the children grew up, seeing with what apparent ease food was
provided for them, they talked to each other about it, wondering that
they never saw such things as their parents brought in. At last

*p. 248*

one proposed to watch when their parents went out and to follow them.

Accordingly next morning the plan was carried out. Those who followed
the father saw him stop at a short distance from the cabin and turn over
a large stone that appeared to be carelessly leaned against another. On
looking closely they saw an entrance to a large cave, and in it were
many different kinds of animals and birds, such as their father had
sometimes brought in for food. The man standing at the entrance called a
deer, which was lying at some distance and back of some other animals.
It rose immediately as it heard the call and came close up to him. He
picked it up, closed the mouth of the cave, and returned, not once
seeming to suspect what his sons had done.

When the old man was fairly out of sight, his sons, rejoicing how they
had outwitted him, left their hiding place and went to the cave, saying
they would show the old folks that they, too, could bring in something.
They moved the stone away, though it was very heavy and they were
obliged to use all their united strength. When the cave was opened, the
animals, instead of waiting to be picked up, all made a rush for the
entrance, and leaping past the frightened and bewildered boys, scattered
in all directions and disappeared in the wilderness, while the guilty
offenders could do nothing but gaze in stupified amazement as they saw
them escape. There were animals of all kinds, large and small--buffalo,
deer, elk, antelope, raccoons, and squirrels; even catamounts and
panthers, wolves and foxes, and many others, all fleeing together. At
the same time birds of every kind were seen emerging from the opening,
all in the same wild confusion as the quadrupeds--turkeys, geese, swans,
ducks, quails, eagles, hawks, and owls.

Those who followed the mother saw her enter a small cabin, which they
had never seen before, and close the door. The culprits found a small
crack through which they could peer. They saw the woman place a basket
on the ground and standing over it shake herself vigorously, jumping up
and down, when lo and behold! large ears of corn began to fall into the
basket. When it was well filled she took it up and, placing it on her
head, came out, fastened the door, and prepared their breakfast as
usual. When the meal had been finished in silence the man spoke to his
children, telling them that he was aware of what they had done; that now
he must die and they would be obliged to provide for themselves. He made
bows and arrows for them, then sent them to hunt for the animals which
they had turned loose.

Then the mother told them that as they had found out her secret she
could do nothing more for them; that she would die, and they must drag
her body around over the ground; that wherever her body was dragged corn
would come up. Of this they were to make their bread. She told them that
they must always save some for seed and plant every year.
