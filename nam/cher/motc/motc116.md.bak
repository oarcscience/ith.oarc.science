# 116. The Star Feathers

A long time ago a warrior of roving disposition went down into the white
settlements toward the east, where for the first time he saw a peacock.
The beautiful long feathers surprised and delighted him, and by trading
some valuable Indian possession of his own he managed to buy a few of
them, which he took with him to the mountains and hid, until he was
ready to use them, in an old beaver lodge under the river bank. To get
into the beaver lodge he had to dive under the water.

Then he set to work secretly and made himself a headdress, with the long
peacock feathers in the front and trailing out behind and the shorter
ones at the sides. At the next dance he wore the new headdress, and
asserted that he had been up to the sky and that these were star
feathers (see number 9, "What the stars are like"). He made a long
speech also, which he pretended was a message he had received from the
star spirits to deliver to the people.

Everyone wondered at the beautiful feathers, so different from any they
had ever seen before. They made no doubt that he had been up to the sky
and talked with spirits. He became a great prophet, and used to keep
himself hidden all day in the beaver hole, and whenever there was a
night gathering for a dance or a council he would suddenly appear among
them wearing his feather headdress and give

the people a new message from the sky. Then he would leave them again,
pretending that he went up to heaven.

He grew famous, and powerful among all the medicine men, until at last
it happened that another Cherokee went down among the white settlements
and saw there another peacock, and knew at once that the prophet was a
fraud. On his return he quietly told some of his friends, and they
decided to investigate. When the next night dance came around the
prophet was on hand as usual with a new message fresh from the stars.
The people listened reverently, and promised to do all that he
commanded. Then he left them, saying that he must return at once to the
sky, but as he went out from the circle the spies followed him in the
darkness, and saw him go down to the river and dive under the water.
They waited, but he, did not come up again, and they went back and told
the people. The next morning a party went to the spot and discovered the
beaver lodge under the bank. One man dived and came up inside, and there
he found the prophet sitting with the peacock feathers by his side.
