# 29. Why The Mink Smells

The Mink was such a great thief that at last the animals held a council
about the matter. It was decided to burn him, so they caught the Mink,
built a great fire, and threw him into it. As the blaze went up and they
smelt the roasted flesh, they began to think he was punished enough and
would probably do better in the future, so they took him out of the
fire. But the Mink was already burned black and is black ever since, and
whenever he is attacked or excited he smells again like roasted meat.
The lesson did no good, however, and he is still as great a thief as
ever.
