# 95. Hemp-carrier

On the southern slope of the ridge, along the trail from Robbinsville to
Valley river, in Cherokee county, North Carolina, are the remains of a
number of stone cairns. The piles are leveled now, but thirty years ago
the stones were still heaped up into pyramids, to which every Cherokee
who passed added a stone. According to the tradition these piles marked
the graves of a number of women and children of the tribe who were
surprised and killed on the spot by a raiding party of the Iroquois
shortly before the final peace between the two Nations. As soon as the
news was brought to the settlements on Hiwassee and Cheowa a party was
made under Tâle'tanigi'skï, "Hemp-carrier," to follow and take vengeance
on the enemy. Among others of the party was the father of the noted
chief Tsunu'lähûñ'skï, or Junaluska, who (Junaluska) died on Cheowa
about 1855.

For days they followed the trail of the Iroquois across the Great Smoky
mountains, through forests and over rivers, until they finally tracked
them to their very town in the far northern Seneca country. On the way
they met another war party headed for the south, and the Cherokee killed
them all and took their scalps. When they came near the Seneca town it
was almost night, and they heard shouts in the townhouse, where the
women were dancing over the fresh Cherokee scalps. The avengers hid
themselves near the spring, and as the dancers came down to drink the
Cherokee silently killed one and another until they had counted as many
scalps as had been taken on Cheowa, and still the dancers in the
townhouse never thought that enemies were near. Then said the Cherokee
leader, "We have covered the scalps of our women and children. Shall we
go home now like cowards, or shall we raise the war whoop and let the
Seneca know that we are men?" "Let them come, if they will," said his
men; and they raised the scalp yell of the Cherokee. At once there was
an answering shout from the townhouse, and the dance came to a sudden
stop. The Seneca warriors swarmed out with ready gun and hatchet, but
the nimble Cherokee were off and away. There was a hot pursuit in the
darkness, but the Cherokee knew the trails and were light and active

runners, and managed to get away with the loss of only a single man. The
rest got home safely, and the people were so well pleased with
Hemp-carrier's bravery and success that they gave him seven wives.
