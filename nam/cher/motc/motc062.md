# 62. The Katydid's Warning

Two hunters camping in the woods were preparing supper one night when a
Katydid began singing near them. One of them said sneeringly, "*Kû!* It
sings and don't know that it will die before the season ends." The
Katydid answered: "*Kû! niwï* (onomatope); O, so you say; but you need
not boast. You will die before to-morrow night." The next day they were
surprised by the enemy and the hunter who had sneered at the Katydid was
killed.
