# 69. Atagâ'hï, The Enchanted Lake

Westward from the headwaters of Oconaluftee river, in the wildest depths
of the, Great Smoky mountains, which form the line between North
Carolina and Tennessee, is the enchanted lake of Atagâ'hï, "Gall place."
Although all the Cherokee know that it is there, no one has ever seen
it, for the way is so difficult that only the animals know how to reach
it. Should a stray hunter come near the place he would know of it by the
whirring sound of the thousands of wild ducks flying about the lake, but
on reaching the spot he would find only a dry flat, without bird or
animal or blade of grass, unless he had first sharpened his spiritual
vision by prayer and fasting and an all-night vigil.

Because it is not seen, some people think the lake has dried up long
ago, but this is not true. To one who had kept watch and fast through
the night it would appear at daybreak as a wide-extending but shallow
sheet of purple water, fed by springs spouting from the high cliffs
around. In the water are all kinds of fish and reptiles, and swimming
upon the surface or flying overhead are great flocks of ducks and
pigeons, while all about the shores are bear tracks crossing

in every direction. It is the medicine lake of the birds and animals,
and whenever a bear is wounded by the hunters he makes his way through
the woods to this lake and plunges into the water, and when he comes out
upon the other side his wounds are healed. For this reason the animals
keep the lake invisible to the hunter.
