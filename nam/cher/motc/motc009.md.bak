# 9. What The Stars Are Like

There are different opinions about the stars. Some say they are balls of
light, others say they are human, but most people say they are living
creatures covered with luminous fur or feathers.

One night a hunting party camping in the mountains noticed two lights
like large stars moving along the top of a distant ridge. They

wondered and watched until the light disappeared on the other side. The
next night, and the next, they saw the lights again moving along the
ridge, and after talking over the matter decided to go on the morrow and
try to learn the cause. In the morning they started out and went until
they came to the ridge, where, after searching some time, they found two
strange creatures about *so* large (making a circle with outstretched
arms), with round bodies covered with fine fur or downy feathers, from
which small heads stuck out like the heads of terrapins. As the breeze
played upon these feathers showers of sparks flew out.

The hunters carried the strange creatures back to the camp, intending to
take them home to the settlements on their return. They kept them
several days and noticed that every night they would grow bright and
shine like great stars, although by day they were only balls of gray
fur, except when the wind stirred and made the sparks fly out. They kept
very quiet, and no one thought of their trying to escape, when, on the
seventh night, they suddenly rose from the ground like balls of fire and
were soon above the tops of the trees. Higher and higher they went,
while the wondering hunters watched, until at last they were only two
bright points of light in the dark sky, and then the hunters knew that
they were stars.
