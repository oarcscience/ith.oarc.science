# 57. The Snake Man

Two hunters, both for some reason under a tabu against the meat of a
squirrel or turkey, had gone into the woods together. When evening came
they found a good camping place and lighted a fire to prepare their
supper. One of them had killed several squirrels during the day, and now
got ready to broil them over the fire. His companion warned him that if
he broke the tabu and ate squirrel meat he would

become a snake, but the other laughed and said that was only a
conjurer's story. He went on with his preparation, and when the
squirrels were roasted made his supper of them and then lay down beside
the fire to sleep.

Late that night his companion was aroused b y groaning, and on looking
around he found the other lying on the ground rolling and twisting in
agony, and with the lower part of his body already changed to the body
and tail of a large water snake. The man was still able to speak and
called loudly for help, but his companion could do nothing, but only sit
by and try to comfort him while he watched the arms sink into the body
and the skin take on a scaly change that mounted gradually toward the
neck, until at last even the head was a serpent's head and the great
snake crawled away from the fire and down the bank into the river.
