# 96. The Seneca Peacemakers

In the course of the long war with the Cherokee it happened once that
eight Seneca determined to undertake a journey to the south to see if
they could make a peace with their enemies. On coming near the border of
the Cherokee country they met some hunters of that tribe to whom they
told their purpose. The latter at once hurried ahead with the news, and
when the peacemakers arrived they found themselves well received by the
Cherokee chiefs, who called a council to consider the proposition. All
but one of the chiefs favored the peace, but he demanded that the eight
delegates should first join them in a war party which was just preparing
to go against a tribe farther south, probably the Creeks. The Seneca
agreed, and set out with the war party for the south; but in the fight
which resulted, the Seneca leader, The Owl, was captured. The other
seven escaped with the Cherokee.

A council was held in the enemy's camp, and it was decided that The Owl
should be burned at the stake. The wood was gathered and everything made
ready, but as they were about to tie him he claimed the warrior's
privilege to sing his death song and strike the post as he recited his
warlike deeds. The request pleased his enemies, who put a tomahawk into
his hands and told him to begin.

He told first his exploits in the north, and then in the west, giving
times and places and the number of scalps taken, until his enemies were
so pleased and interested that they forgot the prisoner in the warrior.
It was a long story, but at last he came to the battle in which he was
taken. He told how many relatives he had killed of the very men around
him, and then, striking the post with his tomahawk, "So many of your
people have I killed, and so many will I yet kill;" and with that he
struck down two men, sprang through the circle of warriors, and was
away. It was all so sudden that it was some moments before his enemies
could recover from their surprise. Then they seized their weapons and
were after him through the woods, but he had had a good start and was
running for his life, so that he outran the chase and finally reached
the Cherokee camp in safety and rejoined his seven companions.

On this proof of good will the Cherokee then concluded the treaty, and
the peacemakers returned to their own country.--Arranged from
Schoolcraft, Notes on Iroquois, p. 258.
