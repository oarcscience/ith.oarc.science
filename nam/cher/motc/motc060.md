# 60. Why The Bullfrog's Head Is Striped

According to one version the Bullfrog was always ridiculing the great
gambler Ûñtsai'yï, "Brass," (see the story) until the latter at last got
angry and dared the Bullfrog to play the *gatayû'stï* (wheel-and-stick)
game with him, whichever lost to be scratched on his forehead. Brass
won, as he always did, and the yellow stripes on the Bullfrog's head
show where the gambler's fingers scratched him.

Another story is that the Bullfrog had a conjurer to paint his head with
yellow stripes (brass) to make him appear more handsome to a pretty
woman he was courting.
