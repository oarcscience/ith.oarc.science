# 41. How The Redbird Got His Color

A Raccoon passing a Wolf one day made several insulting remarks, until
at last the Wolf became angry and turned and chased him. The Raccoon ran
his best and managed to reach a tree by the river side before the Wolf
came up. He climbed the tree and stretched out on a limb overhanging the
water. When the Wolf arrived he saw the reflection in the water, and
thinking it was the Raccoon he jumped at it and was nearly drowned
before he could scramble out again, all wet and dripping. He lay down on
the bank to dry and fell asleep. and while he was sleeping the Raccoon
came down the tree and plastered his eves with dung. When the Wolf awoke
he found he could not open his eyes, and began to whine. Along came a
little brown and through the bushes and beard the Wolf crying and asked
what was

the matter. The Wolf told his story and said, "If you will got my eves
open, I will show you where to find some nice red paint to paint
yourself." "All right," said the brown bird; so he pecked at the Wolf's
eyes until he got off all the plaster. Then the Wolf took him to a rock
that had streaks of bright red paint running through it, and the little
bird painted himself with it, and has ever since been a Redbird.
