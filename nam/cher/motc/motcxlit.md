# Cherokee Transcription

The Cherokee language has the continental vowel sounds *a*, *e*, *i* and
*u*, but lacks *o*, which is replaced by a deep *â*. The obscure or
short *û* lacks is frequently nasalized, but the nasal sound is seldom
heard at the end of a word. The only labial is *m*, which occurs in
probably not more than half a dozen words in the Upper and Middle
dialects, and is entirely absent from the Lower dialect, in which *w*
takes its place. The characteristic *l* of the Upper and Middle dialects
becomes *r* in the Lower, but no dialect has both sounds. There is also
an aspirated *l*; *k* and *t* have the ordinary sounds of these letters,
but *g* and *d* are medials, approximating the sounds of *k* and *t*,
respectively. A frequent double consonant is *ts*, commonly rendered
*ch* by the old traders.
