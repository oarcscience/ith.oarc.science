# 120. The Raven Mocker

Of all the Cherokee wizards or witches the most dreaded is the Raven
Mocker (*Kâ'lanû Ahkyeli'skï*), the one that robs the dying man of life.
They are of either sex and there is no sure way to know one, though they
usually look withered and old, because they have added so many lives to
their own.

At night, when some one is sick or dying in the settlement, the Raven
Mocker goes to the place to take the life. He flies through the air in
fiery shape, with arms outstretched like wings, and sparks trailing
behind, and a rushing sound like the noise of a strong wind. Every
little while as he flies he makes a cry like the cry of a raven when it
"dives" in the air--not like the common raven cry--and those

who hear are afraid, because they know that some man's life will soon go
out. When the Raven Mocker comes to the house he finds others of his
kind waiting there, and unless there is a doctor on guard who knows bow
to drive them away they go inside, all invisible, and frighten and
torment the sick man until they kill him. Sometimes to do this they even
lift him from the bed and throw him on the floor, but his friends who
are with him think he is only struggling for breath.

After the witches kill him they take out his heart and eat it, and so
add to their own lives as many days or years as they have taken from
his. No one in the room can see them, and there is no sear where they
take out the heart, but yet there is no heart left in the body. Only one
who has the right medicine can recognize a Raven Mocker, and if such a
man stays in the room with the sick person these witches are afraid to
come in, and retreat as soon as they see him, because when one of them
is recognized in his right shape he must die within seven days. There
was once a man named Gûñskäli'skï, who had this medicine and used to
hunt for Raven Mockers, and killed several. When the friends of a dying
person know that there is no more hope they always try to have one of
these medicine men stay in the house and watch the body until it is
buried, because after burial the witches do not steal the heart.

The other witches are jealous of the Raven Mockers and afraid to come
into the same house with one. Once a man who had the witch medicine was
watching by a sick man and saw these other witches outside trying to get
in. All at once they heard a Raven Mocker cry overhead and the others
scattered "like a flock of pigeons when the hawk swoops." When at last a
Raven Mocker dies these other witches sometimes take revenge by digging
up the body and abusing it.

The following is told on the reservation as an actual happening:

A young man had been out on a hunting trip and was on his way home when
night came on while he was still a long distance from the settlement. He
knew of a house not far off the trail where an old man and his wife
lived, so he turned in that direction to look for a place to sleep until
morning. When he got to the house there was nobody in it. He looked into
the âsï and found no one there either. He thought maybe they had gone
after water, and so stretched himself out in the farther corner to
sleep. Very soon he heard a raven cry outside, and in a little while
afterwards the old man came into the âsï and sat down by the fire
without noticing the young man, who kept still in the dark corner. Soon
there was another raven cry outside, and the old man said to himself,
"Now my wife is coming," and sure enough in a little while the old woman
came in and sat down by her husband. Then the young man knew they were
Raven Mockers and he was frightened and kept very quiet.

*p. 403*

Said the old man to his wife, "Well, what luck did you have?" "None,"
said the old woman, "there were too many doctors watching. What luck did
you have?" "I got what I went for," said the old man, "there is no
reason to fail, but you never have luck. Take this and cook it and lees
have something to eat." She fixed the fire and then the young man
smelled meat roasting and thought it smelled sweeter than any meat he
had ever tasted. He peeped out from one eye, and it looked like a man's
heart roasting on a stick.

Suddenly the old woman said to her husband, "Who is over in the corner?"
"Nobody," said the old man. "Yes, there is," said the old woman, "I hear
him snoring," and she stirred the fire until it blazed and lighted up
the whole place, and there was the young man lying in the corner. He
kept quiet and pretended to be asleep. The old man made a noise at the
fire to wake him, but still he pretended to sleep. Then the old man came
over and shook him, and he sat up and rubbed his eyes as if he had been
asleep all the time.

Now it was near daylight and the old woman was out in the other house
getting breakfast ready, but the hunter could hear her crying to
herself. "Why is your wife crying?" he asked the old man. "Oh, she has
lost some of her friends lately and feels lonesome," said her husband;
but the young man knew that she was crying because he had heard them
talking.

When they came out to breakfast the old man put a bowl of corn mush
before him and said, "This is all we have--we have had no meat for a
long time." After breakfast the young man started on again, but when he
had gone a little way the old man ran after him with a fine piece of
beadwork and gave it to him, saying, "Take this, and don't tell anybody
what you heard last, night, because my wife and I are always quarreling
that way." The young man took the piece, but when he came to the first
creek he threw it into the water and then went on to the settlement.
There he told the whole story, and a party of warriors started back with
him to kill the Raven Mockers. When they reached the place it was seven
days after the first night. They found the old man and his wife lying
dead in the house, so they set fire to it and burned it and the witches
together.
