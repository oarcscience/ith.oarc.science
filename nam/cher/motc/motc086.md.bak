# 86. Yahula

Yahoola creek, which flows by Dahlonega, in Lumpkin county, Georgia, is
called Yahulâ'ï (Yahula place) by the Cherokees, and this is the story
of the name:

*p. 348*

Years ago, long before the Revolution, Yahula was a prosperous stock
trader among the Cherokee, and the tinkling of the bells hung around the
necks of his ponies could be heard on every mountain trail. Once there
was a great hunt and all the warriors were out, but when it was over and
they were ready to return to the settlement Yahula was not with them.
They waited and searched, but he could not be found, and at last they
went back without him, and his friends grieved for him as for one dead.
Some time after his people were surprised and delighted to have him walk
in among them and sit down as they were at supper in the evening. To
their questions he told them that he had been lost in the mountains, and
that the Nûñnë'hï, the Immortals, had found him and brought him to their
town, where he had been kept ever since, with the kindest care and
treatment, until the longing to see his old friends had brought him
back. To the invitation of his friends to join them at supper he said
that it was now too late--he had tasted the fairy food and could never
again eat with human kind, and for the same reason he could not stay
with his family, but must go back to the Nûñnë'hï. His wife and children
and brother begged him to stay, but he said that he could not; it was
either life with the Immortals or death with his own people--and after
some further talk he rose to go. They saw him as he sat talking to them
and as he stood up, but the moment he stepped out the doorway he
vanished as if he had never been.

After that he came back often to visit his people. They would see him
first as he entered the house, and while he sat and talked he was his
old self in every way, but the instant he stepped across the threshold
he was gone, though a hundred eyes might be watching. He came often, but
at last their entreaties grew so urgent that the Nûñnë'hï must have been
offended, and he came no more. On the mountain at the head of the,
creek, about 10 miles above the present Dahlonega, is a small square
inclosure of uncut stone, without roof or entrance. Here it was said
that he lived, so the Cherokee called it Yahulâ'ï and called the stream
by the same name. Often at night a belated traveler coming along the
trail by the creek would hear the voice of Yahula singing certain
favorite old songs that he used to like to sing as he drove his pack of
horses across the mountain, the sound of a voice urging them on, and the
crack of a whip and the tinkling of bells went with the song, but
neither driver nor horses could be seen, although the sounds passed
close by. The songs and the bells were heard only at night.

There was one man who had been his friend, who sang the same songs for a
time after Yahula had disappeared, but he died suddenly, and then the
Cherokee were afraid to sing these songs any more until it was so long
since anyone had heard the sounds on the mountain that they thought
Yahula must be gone away, perhaps to the West, where others of the tribe
had already gone. It is so long ago now that even

*p. 349*

the stone house may have been destroyed by this time, but more than one
old man's father saw it and heard the songs and the bell, a hundred
years ago. When the Cherokee, went from Georgia to Indian Territory in
1838 some of them said, "Maybe Yahula has gone there and we shall hear
him," but they have never heard him again.
