### KATSINA INITIATION <span id="fr_230"></span>[23](#fn_230.md)

This initiation goes back in place to White House where the real katsina
left and the katsina society was organized. Acoma people do it exactly
the same today.

This ceremony usually follows a little after the dramatization of the
katsina fight; now it is early in April. Every 5 years the dramatization
is held, and after every second dramatization (every 10 years) the,
initiation is held. It is called the initiation of the children
(i'achniamanwatsi'watruma, "young initiated to be").

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

Country Chief asks Antelope Man if it is not time to initiate the
children. (Girls and boys both are in this. This is initiation into the
tribe.) <span id="fr_231"></span>[24](#fn_231.md) Antelope Man says, "Yes,
it is time." They keep watch for the sunrise from the east end of the
mesa. There are different points on the east mesa, where the sun comes
up. The sun is watched from a certain rock; the horizon is on the east
mesa and marked with small gaps. When the sun reaches a certain place,
Country Chief knows it is time for the initiation. So he sets the date
and tells the people, especially all who have a child about 10 years old
(more or less from about 6 years to any age).

The father and mother watch out for this. It is the parents' duty to
select someone to be a "father" to the child, to present him for
initiation. The father makes up a prayer stick with which to approach
the man he is going to ask to act as "father" to the child. Two days
before the ceremony, the father goes to the house of the man he selects.
Usually he selects a [friend](errata.htm#5.md) and he speaks to him as
"brother." He asks him if he will act as "father" to the child, naming
him with clan name. <span id="fr_232"></span>[25](#fn_232.md) He brings
also corn meal and ground up mixed food and cigarettes. The man says a
prayer accepting the child. It is customary to bring a large amount of
corn meal, as the person accepting must take some of it to all his
relatives because this child is to become a son of all of his clan, and
each of his relatives (everyone, men, women and children) takes some of
this corn meal and goes out and prays for the child. Country Chief
appoints a man to represent Tsitsanits, the katsina chief, from
hai'mata’ata <span id="fr_233"></span>[26](#fn_233.md) kiva. Country Chief
also selects two Gomaiowish from the same kiva. (A man belongs in the
kiva of his father.)

They are to dress up with masks representing their parts. At this time
(the morning of the second day before initiation) the Antelope elan's
altar is set up in Mauharo kiva. Country Chief helps bring in the altar.
Country Chief then leaves, and guards the kiva. The Antelope clan nawai
gets some of his clan members who know the songs and in the afternoon
they are brought into Mauharo kiva. Later the two Gomaiowish come in,
talking busily. They have come from the west. Antelope clan nawai waits
for them in his office <span id="fr_234"></span>[27](#fn_234.md)

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

and they go there, reporting to him that they have come, because, "You
have called us. Tsitsanits is on the way and will be here later. We are
coming to initiate the children. We came ahead to bring the medicine
(plants, roots, branches, etc.)."

The Gomaiowish then leave, going up and down the streets talking, They
look at the ground, saying, "There are lots of tracks, there must be
lots of children here!" They say, "Some of them have no moccasins, but
after they are initiated, we will bring them moccasins." The children
are usually frightened half to death. (The talking is for the benefit of
the children and to quiet their fears.) After they have done this,
Gomaiowish enter Mauharo kai. There they dance to the singing of the
Antelope clan, smoking, talking while they sing, making the people
laugh. Just before sundown, they ask permission to go back for
Tsitsanits, who is late. They joke, saying they are going to weigh the
children and measure them. "But I guess they are not coming till
Tsitsanits arrives, so we had better go get him." So they leave.

That evening, at sundown, the man who is to be "father" to the child
goes to one of his relatives to get him to help by putting the feathers
on the heads of the children when they come out from the initiation. The
Gomaiowish leave their medicine in the kiva and the "father" goes and
gets a little piece of each kind. This medicine is to keep the children
from being afraid. Later in the evening all the people enter their
kivas. When the time comes, the Country Chief comes around to the kivas
telling the "fathers" to get their children and bring them to the chief
kiva.

The "fathers" and their helpers take the children to the kivas. Other
men go out to meet Tsitsanits. They go to the west end of the village
and wait there. A short distance southwest of Acoma is where Tsitsanits
and Gomaiowish dress. You can hear their cries as they approach. Before
this the men who are not "fathers" ask their women to boil some corn for
them, as they are going to act "katsina" to present corn to the children
in kiva. They hand it down, but do not enter the kiva. They are not
masked, but the children do not see them. They hand down apples, corn,
etc., which the "fathers" reach up and get.

As soon as Tsitsanits comes past these men, they pray, saying, "He is
the only one who is real; we are only guards." They all make a lot of
noise like katsina, so it can be heard in the kiva. The man acting as
father, when he comes to the home of the child, chews some of the
medicine, spits it over the child and says, "I have come for you, my
child." He gives some to the child, telling him, "Eat this and you won't
be afraid." The parents encourage the child. The child is carried from
its threshold on the back of the "father" all the way into the kiva.
They are placed where they won't get lost. One

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

man can be "father" to two or three children; in this case they have to
hurry so as to get them in before the katsina arrive. The katsina are
not dressed and they believe that if they see the katsina not masked it
will give them the itch and body sores.

Antelope clansmen are singing all this time in the kiva. When the
children hear the noise outside, they get frightened. When Tsitsanits
arrives on the roof, he yells and scratches, while the Gomaiowish make
all the noise they can. A buffalo skin closes the entry. This skin is
painted with katsina masks on the inside of the skin.

Antelope Man stands under the ladder. He has a ball of ashes mixed with
food (corn meal and pollen). When the song ends he throws this ball up
against the skin. The Gomaiowish then open up the skin and Tsitsanits
dashes in as fast as he can, followed by Gomaiowish. This is acted out
to seem as if the ball knocked off the skin cover. The Gomaiowish make a
lot of racket. Tsitsanits shuffles his feet over the tsiwaimitiima.
Antelope Man dips his feathers into the medicine and sprinkles
Tsitsanits and the Gomaiowish. This quiets them down a bit. Antelope Man
then says, "Tsitsanits has come to initiate our children." Tsitsanits
makes gestures of agreement. The ones sitting near on the right side of
the ladder go up first to the altar. There is a rush to get there first.
The "father" leads the child by the hand to the front. Tsitsanits stands
on the west side, the, "father" on the north side, and the child stands
on the tsiwaimitiima. Tsitsanits strikes the child four times (across
shoulder, back, thighs, legs). Then they turn around, the "father"
stands on the tsiwaimitiima (still holding the child) and it is his turn
to be struck. Then the one who is to put on the feather, a turkey
feather, steps up and puts the feather in the hair of the child. If a
man has more than one child, he puts them through one after the other.
(Iatiku also told them to cut children's hair, all but a topknot to
which the feather is tied. Their hair is cut thus until this initiation.
After this it can grow long. That is why children want to go through
this early.) The man tying on the feather first pulls up eight times on
the topknot--so the child will go over four mountains (meaning long
life). The feather is to be worn 4 days. Turkey feathers are used on
prayer sticks as a guard and this hair feather is a guard for these 4
days. On the fourth day the child takes it off with a prayer. During
these 4 days the "father" gets the measurement of the child's feet and
makes moccasins for him (or her) and buckskin clothes (a whole new
outfit).

On the fourth day the katsina will come. The Gomaiowish tell the
children, before they leave, that in 4 days the katsina will come
bringing them presents. It is customary for the Mixed katsina to come.
Any number can come from each kiva. Their masks are brought to

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Mauharo kai. In kiva the "father" is making
moccasins. The "mother," the wife of the "father," is making up the
clothing. Early in the morning of the fourth day, the "mother" goes to
the house of the child and brings the child to her house. They have
there in the house, set in baskets, the outfit for the child: if a
boy--bow and arrow, hunter stick, and clothes; if a girl--clothes and
the rainbow head ornament (uaishtiakayani) <span
id="fr_235"></span>[28](oma31.htm#fn_235.md) ([pl. 13, fig.
1](oma46.htm#img_pl13a).md). <span
id="fr_236"></span>[29](oma31.htm#fn_236.md) When the children are brought
in, the "mother" uncovers the basket, saying, "This has been sent you by
the katsina. The crows brought it from Wenimats." (Children seeing
crows, look at them to see if they are carrying presents, The
"stockings" of the katsina represent crow stockings. Parents point out
the crows to the children, saying, "See, the katsina are going to
come!" <span id="fr_237"></span>[30](oma31.htm#fn_237.md) Katsina presents
are left outside the door, to get children up early, and parents will
say, "See what your brother found! Let's see to whom it belongs." The
children try on the different things to see for whom each thing is
intended.) After the presents are made, the "mother" washes the head of
the child and gives him a feast (on the floor).

Meanwhile, just before the katsina are to come, the chaianyi have been
placing their altars \[? in the kivas\]. They bring the children in
front of the altar and give them a bath to give them new life. This
finishes the initiation.

A general feast will follow. The "mothers" prepare the corn meal which
is brought to the "fathers" by the real fathers as payment for service.
The initiate will regard his "father" as a real father; and all the
relatives of the "father" will be considered relatives.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_229"></span>[108:22](oma29.htm#fr_229.md) According to White
1932, p. 40, the two under war chiefs may refuse, but the first chief
must drink it.

<span id="fn_230"></span>[108:23](oma30.htm#fr_230.md) Cf. White, 1932, pp.
71-75; 1942.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[109:24](oma30.htm#fr_231.md) Women at Acoma are
not initiated into the *societies* (Informant). Although Acoma women are
initiated to the Katsina society, they never wear masks (White, 1932, p.
70). At Sia, according to Stevenson, women participate in masked dances,
presumably wearing masks (Stevenson, 1894, p. 116). White's Sia
informants stated that women were initiates into the katsina
organization, but declared positively that they never wore masks (White,
ms.). At Santa Ana some women are admitted to the katsina organization
and may wear katsina masks representing females (White, ms.). At Santo
Domingo and San Felipe women are not admitted to the katsina
organization; moreover, theoretically, at least, they are kept in
ignorance of the fact that the katsina dancers are men (White, 1935, pp.
49, 83, 96-97, 101, 104; 1932 a, pp. 27, 35). At Cochiti, women are kept
in ignorance of the identity of the katsina dancers (Dumarest, 1919, pp.
174-175; see also Goldfrank, 1927 pp. 44 104).

<span id="fn_232"></span>[109:25](oma30.htm#fr_232.md) Does this imply that
the clan has a stock of personal names, like the Hopi clan? For
Hopi-Acoma parallels, several drawn from this monograph, see Parsons
1939, pp. 980-982.
