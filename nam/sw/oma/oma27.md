### WANDERINGS, PART XVIII

It is not known how much longer the people lived at the bottom of the
rock, but much time elapsed. Many officers died away but finally there
came a time when Kasewat <span id="fr_194"></span>[95](#fn_194.md) was
Country Chief, being the only son of the war chief \[?\]. The older
people remembered that [Kasewat](errata.htm#3.md) had said that eventually
they were to move on top of the rock and in that way they would also be
protected, for the people were the "chosen people." So they decided to
carry out the plan of Kasewat. There were still many pine trees on top
of the mesa. The chaianyi went ahead and planted their prayer sticks on
the site. Country Chief asked the men to go up and clear off the site
and level it. He asked them to make a trail up to the top on the south
side. They called it the rainbow ladder (fig. 1, *2*, p. 18). The
chaianyi were asked to bring down all the ants. They moved down all the
other living things, like centipedes and snakes, that were not wanted
there.

Kasewat made a duplicate of his broken prayer stick and buried it where
the plaza was to be. Then he asked the chaianyi to make four lengths of
prayer sticks \[? road prayer feathers\], which would make a trail to
the center of the plaza. The Antelope clan made their prayer stick
\[feathered string\] to lead to where their headquarters were to be. The
rest of the chaianyi did likewise, planting their prayer sticks at the
places where their kivas were to be. Country Chief did the same for all
the public kivas and for his headquarters.

When all was ready, Country Chief and the Antelope clan were the first
to be helped in building their houses. Everyone was to help.

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

\[paragraph continues\] After finishing one place, Country Chief would
say what clan would come next. They helped each other thus. But before
they had finished all the buildings, the water ran out. So they cleaned
out the hollow places in the rock for cisterns <span
id="fr_195"></span>[96](#fn_195.md) and walled in some so that they would
hold more. When the next rain came they had plenty of water. They built
the home \[?house ?houses\] for the Antelope clan. After all the houses
had been built, Country Chief told the people it was time for them to
move up on Yakakotona kanach <span id="fr_196"></span>[97](#fn_196.md)
(completely kernelled long ear of corn).

So the chaianyi were the first to go up the Rainbow trail. The chaianyi
brushed the disease from the people before they climbed up. They were to
help the people up. The chaianyi were to go up first and the people
below were to ask permission to come up on Yakakotona. Country Chief
came first to the bottom of the trail and asked permission: "Dini (up on
top!), Country Chief asks if he will be allowed to come up." The
chaianyi answer, "Yes, come on up, bring all your game, all your beads,
all your crops. Bring long life and leave nothing behind. Come up!" The
chaianyi had made different places along the trail where they were to go
and pray. One chaianyi was along to instruct the people as they came.
The first place was where the lion was to guard, next was where the bear
was to guard. The next above, the frog (green) was to guard. The last,
near the top, the snake was to guard. Country Chief prayed at each of
these places, then the chaianyi let him pass.

The Antelope clan was next and then the rest came in turn in the same
manner. When Country Chief had come up, he was formally directed to his
house and then the rest were directed in the same manner, by the
chaianyi, to their houses. It took 2 days to move all the people up, for
every ceremonial detail was observed for each clan and society. After
the people were moved, the chaianyi were asked by Country Chief to
initiate \[?\] the kivas and to put guards on each of the four walls.
After all was completed they lived for a long time there, year after
year going through their ceremonies. This is as far as the tradition is
told.

The tradition is told and taught when a man is being initiated into the
of the societies. During the 4-day period while the chaianyi are letting
up the altar, they tell it. The songs contain information also. Besides,
in preparing for a ceremony, that part of the tradition which may relate
to it is told. Before the Kopishtaiya come, for example, when the men
are getting ready for them, they tell in kiva the part they are going to
enact. Thus they will be thoroughly familiar with the spirit and details
of the ceremony.

is the completely kernelled ear of corn used ceremonially. The meaning
of kanach is obscure. ka is his, or her; perhaps nach is
head--nack’a'inyi is head at Santa Ana. The great rock-mesa upon which
Acoma pueblo rests is referred to ceremonially as a kotona, "standing
erect"; the people live upon the kotona's head (White, 1942)
