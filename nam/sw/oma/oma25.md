### WANDERINGS, PART XVI

The people were still looking for Haako. They had not lost the two eggs
that had been given them. They said, "This cannot yet be the right
place, our bad luck shows that." So they got out into the plains again
and moved south. They passed many ruins where people had been living
before and they crossed the paths of other people. These people were
enemies of each other. It is not known how these others had been saved
from the flood. When attacked by enemies, the Twins would go out alone
to fight, and they always won by virtue of their father's power. They
thought they would keep track of how many they killed. So after killing
an enemy, they would put their thumb on the head and scalp it, cutting
around the thumb.

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

They traveled on and passed a place called Kawaíka <span
id="fr_173"></span>[74](#fn_173) (lake.md), where Laguna stands. Here they
stopped for the forgetting ceremonies. <span
id="fr_174"></span>[75](#fn_174.md) There was no town here at that time.
South of the lake they symbolically crossed the four mountains. When
they got to a place which they called Kutsekatsa (place of antelope;
antelope range), because there were very many antelope there--when they
got there they asked if they could rest, as they had seen many antelope
and they said it would be a good place to stop. They camped there and
found water. The name of the place was Shuimi kaiya (turquoise cave).
There is a big rock about 10 miles northeast of Acoma of white
sandstone; on the north side is a cave with water coming from it. While
they camped here they had good luck killing antelope. They traveled
around the region and found a place called Dyaptsiam <span
id="fr_175"></span>[76](#fn_175.md) (dyap, a hardwood tree; tsiam, pass or
gap). The people thought of moving there to build another village. Some
of them said it must be Haako, as they found turkeys and antelope in
plenty. So they broke camp and at Dyaptsiam built a new village.

Here they again established their altars and ceremonies. The chaianyi
cleared the place of diseases. The chaianyi always took a basket of
prayer sticks which they buried in the center of the proposed site, and
under the basket they buried an arrowhead. This was to protect the
pueblo. Some of the people wanted to live at the bottom of the mesa, but
the Twins said that it would be better to live on top, where they could
look around, and when they left it they could look back and see their
home outstanding and think of it as a wonderful place. Also it would
furnish them protection. Some others did not agree that that was the
right place, so they broke away from those who agreed with the Twins,
saying, "We have seen another mesa that is more imposing, we will build
our home there." This was further south. This was called Katsima (braced
cliff, <span id="fr_176"></span>[77](#fn_176.md) talus cliff, the Enchanted
Mesa). A few families, very few, went up but they soon ran out of water
and after a time rejoined those at the other village. They built a
pretty village on the low mesa, Dyaptsiam. (The ruins are still there.)

Here they lived a long time contentedly because there was much game.
Here they found many turkeys. They had many ceremonies every season and
got along well. They had with them masks representing Chakoya katsina.
No one had ever used them. It was a different kind of mask covering only
the face. They know that these Chakoya were very good hunters and fond
of game. So it came to their mind that they had these masks and they
recalled they were

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

good hunters. Since they had no such game, they thought of calling them
and bringing them to dance. All agreed that it would be good, so more of
the masks were made. The men belonging to the katsina \[organization\]
met in kiva. Country Chief brought the masks to the chaianyi to be
brought to life, with the usual ceremony. The men who were going to take
part went through the ceremony and went out into the country and put on
their masks and costumes. The people were expecting the Chakoya, so the
impersonators visited the village, The people found that these Chakoya
had very pretty songs in a language easy to understand. Their songs
always named game and told how to hunt. The first time they were called
it was near spring time and they had plenty of snow, and they were lucky
in their hunting. They found the Chakoya dance to be pleasant and
interesting because it was new. When the dancers finished, the people
went home and the dancers went into the country to decostume. This was a
secret dance and they did not let the people know that they were not
real.

It was time for planting. Antelope Man recalled that Iatiku had told him
the people were to have a dance every season before planting time, so he
told Country Chief to wait and not plant yet; they were going to have a
dance to make all kinds of crops. All the people were told to meet in
kiva where Antelope man was to tell them how to dance and for what
reason. This they did and Antelope Man told them that mother Iatiku
advised them to dance this Auwĕ before planting. So he told them to make
images of corn, pumpkins, and beans, and bring them on the night that
they were to gather to dance, These songs and dances had been taught
them by Iatiku in Shipapu but they had forgotten them.

Antelope Man set up his altar in kiva. The people came to the dance and
brought their images, which they placed in front of the altar. They
recalled some of the songs and they had a dance. This dance lasted all
night. The men would dance in a circle (inside kiva) for a while, then
they would rest and the women would dance. <span
id="fr_177"></span>[78](#fn_177.md) This continued till nearly sunrise.
Then Antelope Man told them to come forward to the altar and get the
images they had brought. He told them that their prayers in the dances
were now with these images. They were to take these and again pray to
the directions, then they were to take the images to the gardens and
plant them. This was done and they found that it was good. They had
abundant harvests,

The twins Masewi and Oyoyewi were very helpful to the people, They were
always up early <span id="fr_178"></span>[79](#fn_178.md) and they went out
into the country and yelled to the clouds (katsina). It is not known how
long they lived at this place. The Twins were always traveling. One time
they went

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

to South Mountain, the home of Maiyochina, the Summer ruler, who is the
spirit of the south direction. When the Twins got there they found that
Maiyochina had a guard who was not to let anyone in. They asked him his
name and he told them Gaukapuchume <span
id="fr_179"></span>[80](#fn_179.md) (busybody? someone always wanting to do
something). The Twins found him to be very skillful, a good gambler, a
good stick runner, and quick witted. He challenged the Twins to
different games and taught them a new game; how to win arrows from each
other. They had won a lot of his property. They put up a target. Whoever
got closest to it would win. (Gaukapuchume wanted to get the sacred
arrows, which he knew they had.)

They had a race on which they bet arrows. The guard was old and lost, so
the Twins won everything he had to bet. The old man got angry. He still
had a baby's head made up to look like a ball. It was full of blood.
They did not want to gamble for this yet, so they asked him where Haako
was, they had come to ask Maiyochina, but since they had not yet seen
Maiyochina they would ask the guard. So he answered, "'Maybe you know
the place Katsima. Haako is just southwest of that place, a large rock.
You will find it by going to the northeast end and yelling. Then you
will hear the echo very distinctly. This is the place you are looking
for." He asked the Twins to give him back what they had won in return
for this information. But the Twins would not do so, saying, "You were
the one who started betting and you taught us how to gamble. You lost,
so the winnings are ours." Gaukapuchume asked them once more to give
them back, and the Twins said no. He asked a third time with the same
result. He asked the fourth time. Still they refused. Then the old man
hit the ball with a stick up against the wall of the house. It
splattered blood and, on falling to the floor, started to cry like a
baby. This frightened the Twins and they ran out, taking their winnings
with them. The old man chased them hitting toward them the ball, which
always cried. Piece by piece, Masewi and Oyoyewi dropped the things they
had won as they fled. After getting away from Gaukapuchume, they stopped
to talk it over, saying, "This is the first time I have ever been
frightened; were you frightened, too? He must have supernatural power."
But they did not think much about it, and returned to their home.

Upon returning, they stayed a long time, but one day they went to
Country Chief and told him what they had learned. They told him that it
was that place farther south that was the real Haako and they left it up
to him to find out. He was the one to look for it and see if the echo
was there. So Country Chief called the chaianyi to a meeting and told
them the message Masewi and Oyoyewi had brought back

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

from South Mountain. He told the chaianyi also that he still had the two
eggs which Iatiku had given them to bring to Haako. "We should not stay
here longer," he said. "I will go on ahead and find if it is the right
place." So they set a date for him to leave with some of the chaianyi.
The chaianyi invited Masewi and Oyoyewi to come along, So they went to
the south to look for Haako.

They saw this rock and went toward the northeast end. Country Chief
cried out, "Haako!" and they all listened. He yelled four times to make
sure, and every time the echo came back clearly. They all agreed this
must be the place. They returned to the people and had another meeting.
They recalled that they had been instructed to break the parrot egg at
Haako and they were to take the crow's egg on afterward to Kuyapukauwak.
They decided to move, as the distance was not far and they had been told
by Iatiku to go to this place. Country Chief told all the people to
prepare for 4 days and to move. He told them to get everything ready so
as to leave nothing behind. The people were glad they were near Haako
and were anxious to move.

On the fourth day they left, and on the same day reached the foot of the
rock. They gathered close around Country Chief who held up the two eggs,
telling them, "These were given us by Iatiku. One is a parrot egg. The
other is a crow egg. You are to choose the egg you think is the parrot
egg." He told them to step up one at a time. He placed the two eggs on a
piece of buckskin and told each person to stand on the side they chose
as the one which was the parrot egg. (The one to choose was the head of
the family, the father). <span id="fr_180"></span>[81](#fn_180.md) The
chaianyi were the first to make their choice, then came the people.
After this was done there was a woman just about to bear a child. She
said, "When my baby comes she will belong to the Parrot clan."

Country Chief picked up the egg the Twins had chosen, and said, "This
will be the parrot egg \[?\]. Those who have chosen this egg will live
here, at Haako." He told them they must not retract their choice, but
must stay on the side they had chosen. He told them the parrot was
supposed to be a very pretty bird and would be useful, while the crow
would be a pest and good for nothing. Most of the chaianyi and Country
Chief himself were on the side of the egg he was going to break. He
stepped back, telling the people to watch very carefully. This egg was
blue and was very pretty, while the other was a dull color. He started
to count, one, two, three, four. On the fourth count he threw it against
the rock. When it hit it broke and a number of crows flew out of it. The
losers felt badly, <span id="fr_181"></span>[82](#fn_181.md) but they could
not retract, because Iatiku had told them if they did so they would
never live happily there \[?anywhere\]. Country Chief told them, "This
ends our journey,

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

\[paragraph continues\] The rest must journey on to Kuyapukauwak and
take the other egg with them."

They all camped at this place. There were some chaianyi who were with
those who were to go on south. They were given their altars and some of
the masks to take with them. Most of the officers were to remain, so
they had to make new officers for the other group. They were to make a
new Country Chief, so the old Country Chief chose a man and instructed
him in his duties, giving him duplicates of the necessary things.
Antelope Man did the same, appointing a man to take his place with the
other group. When the time came to separate, a meeting was held and
Country Chief and Antelope Man told the departing people who their
officers were to be. This was a very sad time for both groups. The
parrot group then left toward the south and it is not known how far they
went.

The people who remained were told by Country Chief to build a village at
the foot of this rock. They did this and it is not known how long they
lived in this village. They carried on their ceremonies as before. They
were lucky and happy because they had come to their permanent home.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_172"></span>[78:73](oma24.htm#fr_172.md) Keresan informants
invariably use the English word "work" to designate the exercise, or
manipulation of supernatural power.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[79:74](oma25.htm#fr_173.md) The Keresan name for
Laguna. The Informant is translating from Spanish, not from Keresan.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[79:75](oma25.htm#fr_174.md) Actually at Laguna
there is a grooved rock for pebble pushing (Parsons, 1923, fig. 20). For
Zuñi see Parsons, 1923, figs. 21, 22; Benedict, 1935, vol. 1, p. 117.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[80:78](oma25.htm#fr_177.md) At Cochiti and Jemez
the women in this dance form an inner circle.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[80:79](oma25.htm#fr_178.md) A great virtue among
the Pueblos.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[81:80](oma25.htm#fr_179.md) See White, 1942.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[82:81](oma25.htm#fr_180.md) This is not a Pueblo
Indian conception; the father is not "the head of the family." This
informant, who had left Acoma and who wanted to adopt white man's ways.
was, however, unquestionably the head of his family.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[82:82](oma25.htm#fr_181.md) Apparently not
because they cared about their destination but because they had lost the
parrots.
