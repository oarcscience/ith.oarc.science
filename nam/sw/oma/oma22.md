### WANDERINGS, PART XIII

The people lived at Washpashuka a long time. The katsina, used to come
and dance for them. After a time, some of the men began to mock the
katsina again. They found out who these mockers were; the War chief
found out their names. He remembered how the katsina had come and beaten
and killed the people when they had mocked them before, so he thought
that the best way to punish these people was to dramatize this battle of
the katsina. <span id="fr_159"></span>[60](#fn_159.md) So Country Chief
called a council of all the people who knew about the katsina, Antelope
Man, and the chaianyi. At this meeting Country Chief told them they were
to do this even if it meant the lives of some of their relatives or

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

friends. It took a long time to get the consent of all, as they knew
some of the mockers. Even if a man had a son who was a mocker, he had to
assist. So they called council after council and picked out the men who
were to represent two Gomaiowish messengers, and the man who was to
represent Tsitsanits, the leader of the katsina. They decided also to
have every member of the Antelope clan, even women and children, to
guard against the katsina coming at the people, and they were all
furnished with long staffs.

This is what they were to do. Everyone knew the katsina were to regard
them \[i. e., members of the Antelope clan\] as their fathers. So if
they held out their staff horizontally in front of a katsina, he should
not run over them and not run against the staff. (The katsina must
respect this staff. If a katsina touches a staff and another katsina
sees him, the second katsina will jump at the first and beat him.)
Antelope Man also made an i'chini' <span
id="fr_160"></span>[61](#fn_160) (a wall made of skins of buffalo.md). This
was to represent the pueblo. It was understood that the katsina were to
whip this ichini and thus symbolically to whip the people. They were not
actually to strike the people themselves at all. The ichini was to be
set up outside the pueblo where the katsina were to come. (It was set up
as a "wall" or "fort" to protect the pueblo.) The katsina were to
approach it and strike it with their clubs and weapons.--They took care
that those who had mocked the katsina should know nothing of these plans
as these mockers were to be killed.

The Corn clan was also asked to call all its members to help at this
time. They were to carry the ichini, to set it up, and hold it. The ones
who were to impersonate the katsina killed deer <span
id="fr_161"></span>[62](#fn_161.md) and took some of the blood into the
kiva and distributed it among the members who were to act as katsina.
They filled with blood the intestine of a deer which they were to wear
around the neck. (All this was planned in kiva.) The twins Masewi and
Oyoyewi were asked to take part. They were to stand on each side of the
ichini and when the katsina attempted to strike them, one of the Twins
would knock down the katsina and cut the blood-filled intestine on his
throat. Antelope Man was to be told, just before the katsina came in, to
ask these guilty ones to come with him to the plaza to pray. The katsina
were to come. The men \[i. e., the mockers\], of course, did not know
what was to happen. When Antelope Man took them out, the katsina were to
spring out and jump on them and catch the guilty ones. They were to
chase them around the plaza, catch them, and kill them with clubs.
(Originally the real katsina would catch a man and pull him apart;
nowadays the impersonators seize him and club him to death.) Then the
twins were to come into the plaza and knock down katsina right and left,
cutting their "throats."

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

The ichini was to stand facing west and all the drama was to take place
in front of it. The Antelope clan was to stand on each side, winging out
from the ichini.

Members of the Katsina society that were to take part in the ceremony
went into the mountain, got branches from a hardy oak, made tea, and
purified themselves for 4 days. The night of the third day, they made
prayer sticks of hard wood.

It was understood that the katsina were to act enraged as they entered
the village and were to fight among themselves. If anyone fell or was
killed in this fighting, they were not to be brought into the pueblo but
were to be buried with their masks on in the wilderness. (This fighting
among the katsina as they approach the village is real; they work
themselves up into a frenzy. Here grudges and personal disagreements are
worked out and several are killed in this fighting. <span
id="fr_162"></span>[63](#fn_162.md) Men who are killed are never mentioned
again by anyone. They are just forgotten. In the plaza only the heretics
are killed, and while now and then a katsina gratifies a personal grudge
against a heretic, these cases are exceptional.)

(Every year, <span id="fr_163"></span>[64](#fn_163.md) at the season the
katsina were killed, katsina are believed to die for three 10's (30
days) and then come to life. At this time the Antelope clan set their
altar on the 28th day and say prayers for the Katsina to come alive, and
that night they have a dance in kiva.)

When the time came, the men who regarded themselves as manly got
together in kiva. It was planned that they should not put on their full
costume or make up pretty. (They were to leave off certain feathers from
their masks.) They painted their bodies white all over. Early the next
morning they went further out into the country and all hid in one place
(4 or 5 miles distant from the town). In the pueblo, too, the people
were making preparations. They made prayer sticks and painted up, both
men and women of the Antelope clan, and put feather down on their heads.
They were painted "strawberry" <span id="fr_164"></span>[65](#fn_164.md)
all over but the face. Then the ichini was brought out. The women of
Antelope clan were given each a staff (yapi) ([pl. 14, fig.
1](oma47.htm#img_pl14a), *c*.md). Masewi blessed the ichini, giving it
power. When the time came they also called Shuracha, katsina of the Corn
clan.

About noon, two Gomaiowish brought messages to the village from
Wenimats. They told Country Chief that the katsina were coming to visit
them and bring them gifts and that they would arrive a little after
midday. So Antelope Man went and got all the mockers and brought them
into his altar and spoke to them and gave them advice.

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

\[paragraph continues\] He showed them how to make prayer sticks with
which to pray to the katsina. He told them not to leave there but to
wait at the altar and he would lead them out when the katsina came, to
pray to them. The Gomaiowish did not accept any of the offerings of
Country Chief-tobacco, corn, or meal. They offered them food which they
did not accept. They had with them bows and arrows which Country Chief
asked for as a gift. They acted like the real Gomaiowish. Antelope chief
and the people held them and took away their bows and arrows forcibly.
The Gomaiowish then ran away, back to the men who were to impersonate
the katsina. The Gomaiowish told them of the incident, exaggerating it,
saying they had been almost killed and told them they should fight as
hard as they could to kill as many people as

they could. So the men put on their masks and started toward the
village. There were many of them. On their way they picked up sticks and
tore off branches to use as clubs. They selected the strongest they
could find. The man acting as Tsitsanits was trying to keep them back.

The village was all prepared and the ichini was set up in place (fig.
6). The Antelope clan (men, women, and children) were told to stand out
in front, holding the staffs to guard the village. (Men and women
alternated.) Tsitsanits was ahead and was first to reach the ichini. The
men in front lot him through and he leaned against the ichini and rubbed
his back against it to gain strength and courage. (Compare pp.
[41](oma14.htm#page_41), [63](oma18.htm#page_63)..md)

At first the men were in front. Then, after Tsitsanits came in, they
fell back into the "wings," or lines of women. The katsina rushed up to
the ichini, striking it four times, then they turned around

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

and ran away. Then anyone could come and strike the ichini; there was a
race to see who would be first. The Antelope clan watched to see that no
one struck it more than four times. The katsina tried to pass the people
but the Antelope clan held their staffs horizontally and barred the way.
The ichini was propped up behind by three sticks. As the katsina
approached, the Shuracha katsina were behind the ichini (which had been
erected by them and the War Twins), When the ichini was set up, the
Shuracha started to dance and kept it up during all the time the katsina
were striking the ichini, leaving only Masewi and Oyoyewi at the ichini.

After all the katsina had struck the ichini four times, they ran around
striking themselves. The Shuracha and the War Twins took down the ichini
and carried it into the plaza, where they set it up on the north side.
After the ichini was taken down, the line closed in the gap that was
left, and the katsina were held back by the Antelope clan.

The mockers were now brought from the altar to the front of the ichini.
They did not know there were to be killed. They came out to pray to the
katsina and they thought this was to be done in order that they might be
forgiven. But the katsina knew what they were to do. When the ichini was
moved, the Antelope women were sent ahead with it to form wings and the
men held back the katsina. When all was set up, Antelope Man shouted
that all was ready. The Antelope Men guarding the katsina turned and ran
to the plaza, followed by the katsina; the men took their place in the
wings with the women. The katsina rushed in and clubbed to death all the
mockers, who were waiting in front of the ichini with their prayer
sticks expecting to pray for forgiveness.

Now was the turn of the twins, Masewi and Oyoyewi. They caught the two
Gomaiowish and castrated them. The Gomaiowish were the leaders in the
killing. They wore their blood bladder in their crotch. Tsitsanits was
not killed. He had been stationed well back of the ichini where they
could not get at him. Masewi and Oyoyewi then attacked the katsina and
cut their throats. Their heads sank down and they fell to earth
blood-soaked, simulating death. While lying on the ground they prayed
that the blood give new strength to the earth, <span
id="fr_165"></span>[66](#fn_165.md) that the earth produce more.

After Masewi and Oyoyewi had killed all the katsina they took out their
staff and arrowhead, the medicine Sun had given them and, going back to
the katsina, brought them all back to life. Antelope nawai had prayer
sticks with him with which to pray after the katsina had come to life.
They prayed that the real katsina would not come again to kill the
people. The katsina impersonators acted as if brought to life. This was
all dramatization but the guilty ones were

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

really killed, probably 8 or 10. After the Antelope men had made this
prayer, the katsina got up and taking the dead mockers with them, left
the village. They buried them out in the desert. They did this to make
the people believe more strictly in the katsina. The Antelope people
then took down the ichini, took it apart, and put it away. The Shuracha,
who were dancing all this time, were dismissed and left. <span
id="fr_166"></span>[67](oma23.htm#fn_166.md)--This is the way they passed
their time at Washpashuka.
