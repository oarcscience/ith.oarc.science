### RULE FOR TRACKING LARGE GAME

Suppose a man starts early in the morning tracking an animal. Another
man starts later and comes in ahead and kills the animal. It belongs to
the one who first started to track it.

After hunting all day, when the people were about to make the last
circle, Eagle Man announced that if anyone killed anything in this last
circle it would belong to him (the killer). All the other game was to go
to the Antelope Man for food for the katsina. (The reason Iatiku had
made Antelope Man leader (chief) was so when the katsina came he would
have food brought to him to feed the katsina.) <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md) Eagle Man then announced, "You may go
home and rest."

The day after the hunt, the people who had killed game were supposed to
roast it and have it ready for the Eagle Man, who was to gather it up
and bring it to the Antelope Man. This was the instruction given by
Eagle Man at the last announcement on the hunt: "If a rabbit, you are to
skin it carefully and save the skin. Break the upper part of the legs of
the rabbit and fold the front legs across the breast and hind legs
across the back." He told them to take some, corn meal and pollen and
place them under each leg of the rabbit, to thank Mother Earth and pray
that she would raise more game. He also told them not to put the rabbit
into the fire or coals head first when roasting it, but to face it out
so its spirit could escape and return to be reborn and thus furnish more
game. The spirit of the rabbit would take with it as food the corn and
pollen offerings placed under the legs.

Such were the instructions to the hunters. They were always to be
followed so they would have game.

When a deer is killed, it is cut up where it falls; the legs are cut off
and the ribs taken out. The head, the backbone, and the skin are all
connected in one piece. When cut open, the entrails are placed to one
side on the ground. The bladder is taken out and placed in the center of
the entrails <span id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md) and the hunter prays
that the deer be reborn and that he will have good luck with game. He
has corn meal and pollen and pieces of beads and shells which he
sprinkles on.--All of these practices are according to instructions
given by Eagle Man on the first hunt.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_54"></span>[22:55](oma08.htm#fr_54.md) Communal hunts for
small game are almost always to provide food for the katsina and for
fetishes, See Boas, 1928 pt. 1; pp. 296-97; White, 1935, pp. 144-46.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[22:56](oma08.htm#fr_55.md) The vulva or the penis
and testicles are placed in the stomach (White, 1942).
