### WANDERINGS, PART I

The game was all gathered and saved for the katsina at the house of
Antelope clan. After this had been done, the men who had been taught the
hunting songs, made songs of their own, rejoicing over the hunt, and put
on a dance in honor of the Eagle Man and proclaimed him leader of the
hunt. Then Iatiku said, "Let us try again to call the katsina." So she
asked the Antelope Man to call the katsina again. Antelope Man notified
the people to pray for the katsina to visit them again and for them to
bring their prayer sticks to his altar. Antelope Man took the baskets of
prayer sticks, prayed, and buried them in the ground. They were received
at Wenimats.

So it happened again as before. The messenger Gomaiowish was again sent
out to notify the people that the katsina were coming on the fourth day.
So four women from the Antelope clan were selected to prepare the food
that had been brought in by the Eagle Man for a feast. And every
household was asked to bring some flour to the Antelope clan altar. The
four women also prepared this for the katsina. The other time, Iatiku
saw that the people had to bring food to the door where the katsina were
staying. This was why she called the community hunt so the people would
not have to come around again. Now only the Antelope clan were permitted
to serve the katsina. So everything happened all right. They were taken
care of at the Antelope elan altar and Iatiku said, "All is well. Now it
does not seem to me that we are playing with the katsina; they are now
to be regarded as sacred." (The first visit had been rather informal;
the katsina were treated much as human visitors.)

Iatiku was satisfied that everything worked well with the katsina part.
But she saw that the Antelope clan was carrying too much of the burden,
so she thought of making another officer to be called tsa'tia
hochani, <span id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md) the war chief. She
selected the first man in the Sky clan, because he was to rule on the
outside. He was to be above the Eagle Man, that is, to rank above him
and above all other officers. Whatever he says goes. In the old days
this office was always from the Sky clan. <span
id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md) Iatiku called this man and said, "I am
going to make you tsa'tia hochani." So she made for him what is called
hachamoni kaiok <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md) (broken prayer
stick) ([pl. 5, fig. 2](oma38.htm#img_pl05b).md). It has the four trails

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

marked on the four sides. This would extend from the earth up to the
sky. <span id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md) She gave it to him and told
him, "When you hold it clasped in your hands, you are drawing all the
people together so they will not be scattered. With this you will have
great power over all the rest of the people. You will have them tucked
under your arms, <span id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md) and their minds
will be tucked in your temples" (meaning "you will do their thinking for
them and speak for them; you will be their mind"). Then Iatiku taught
him his prayers. His prayers should always start from Shipapu. After
coming up from Shipapu, they should start from the north and take in the
west, south, and east. This is a very long prayer.

He was told that he would rule \[officiate\] around these places but he
was not to be paid for his services; <span
id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md) he would represent the people and pray
for them. (This is still done.)

Before this the Antelope clan was ruling everything. The Country Chief
took the burden of all rule outside the pueblo. Iatiku told him. that he
was to have the hardest work, that he was the one to go out and meet the
katsina and bring the message to the Antelope clan, and that it was his
duty to notify the people by crying out all matters of importance
relating to outside.

Now Iatiku said, "Let's try to call the katsina." (They were still at
Shipapu.) All was done as before and when all was over Iatiku said
things worked out better. But she saw that Country Chief was carrying
too much of the burden so she thought of giving him two helpers. She
selected the first two sons (or maybe brothers) of Country Chief. She
called the oldest one who was to be next in rank Shuti mut (wren
youth). <span id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65.md) The other was to be called
Shpa'ti mut (mocking bird youth). <span id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66.md)
In this order they were to rank. Iatiku named them thus because they
were to represent these birds, to make their sounds, and to bring
messages to the people, thus relieving Country Chief. (It is very
different now. Today they call them the two cooks because they serve the
head man. They prepare his corn meal and pollen so he will always have
plenty. Now they have Spanish names.)

Country Chief had to go out and pray every fourth day to the north,
another 4 days to the west, another 4 days to the South, and 4 more days
to the east. (Now they take turns, and the three of

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

them do it, making the burden easier. These helpers also help as town
criers.) Everything was tried out again and Iatiku was satisfied.

Country Chief was also instructed to watch the seasons. He was to go out
in the country each day to watch the plants. At this time the only way
they could tell the seasons was by the growth of the plants. Country
Chief was to tell the people what season they were ending or
approaching. (It is told in later tradition that Country Chief started
to watch the stars and moon and, being able to tell seasons more
accurately in this way, he abandoned the method of watching the plants.
Country Chief also watched the sun to determine the time for the
solstices. Now the Antelope chief does this.) <span
id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67.md) (Sun is male, Moon female; hence men are
strong, women weaker.) The katsina that live in the east come for the
winter solstice and the katsina that live in the west come for the
summer solstice. <span id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68.md)

They lived for a long time with these officers. Finally, when everything
seemed all right with the katsina of the west, Iatiku decided to try the
katsina of the east. (These are not called katsina but Kopishtaiya. The
first was Tsiukiri ([pl. 4, fig. 2](oma37.htm#img_pl04b).md) who went with
his mate and reproduced. His mate is Hi'waii'tsa.) <span
id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md) So Iatiku told Country Chief to tell the
Antelope Man that they were going to try and call the Kopishtaiya ([pl.
6, fig. 2](oma39.htm#img_pl06b).md), who live where the sun comes up, and
to make preparations. So the Antelope Man said, "It is all right. Go and
tell the people to wait for them and prepare for them by gathering
material to make prayer sticks."

So Country Chief told his two helpers to go out and before cutting
sticks for prayer sticks they should say the prayer, "Come and help us,
Yellow Flint! Come, Red Flint, come White Flint! Help us! You are the
ones who are really going to cut the prayer sticks." Thus he taught them
the song they were to sing when they started to cut the prayer sticks
with the flints. These that they brought in were to be used at the
broken prayer stick of Country Chief. So Country Chief came out to meet
them as they brought in the sticks. (They would stop outside and cry
gaiya' (inside), so as not to interrupt any ceremony that might be going
on. Nowadays they knock on the door.) So Country Chief made a trail for
them to come inside and they brought their sticks in. They were
instructed to bring them on the fourth day.

On the fourth day all the prayer sticks were brought in. They made a
prayer stick that was to look like the ones given to the kopishtaiya by
Iatiku so they would recognize them. So the prayer sticks were brought
in and Antelope Man went out to the east with them in baskets, prayed,
and buried them. Four days from that

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

time, he said, the people were to wait for the Kopishtaiya. They had no
messenger like the messenger of the katsina, but the people were sure
they would come. Just before sun-up Country Chief heard them singing in
the east, so he sent messages in the village that the Kopishtaiya were
coming near. The Kopishtaiya were not dancers, they came only to circle
the outside of the village. At intervals they went around the village,
prayed, and put up dapi'năshtimĭt, <span
id="fr_70"></span>[71](oma11.htm#fn_70.md) spiritual fortifications or
protections. After circling the town they came into the plaza. The
people saw that they had seeds in bags with them. They were all naked
save for breech clouts made of rabbit skins. They wore no moccasins even
though it was very cold, for they represented strong, hardy men. They
gave presents of seed to the people and told them to plant these seeds.
After they had finished distributing them they left. They thanked the
people for praying with prayer sticks and food (as is daily custom) and
then they left. Iatiku saw that they were real and that all went well so
she told the people to believe in them also.

Some time after this the evil spirit (Pishuni) came to the people of
Iatiku in the form of disease. It had by this time grown of itself into
a big power, and the people were stricken with a plague. It is not known
what form of disease it was for the people had never known sickness
before. They were panic stricken. They tried by every way, gathering
plants and making drinks, to relieve themselves but nothing helped them.
So Iatiku thought of choosing a man to be known as chaianyi (medicine
man). So she called Country Chief and told him what she was thinking of
doing. Country Chief said, "All right." So Iatiku told him, "I have told
you to watch your people and to know them, so I will leave it up to you
to select the man." Iatiku wished the Antelope clan man and the Eagle
man to be present at a council together with the three Country Chiefs.
The meeting was held. Country Chief stood up and told the others that he
would select the first man from the Oak clan to be first chaianyi, and
his altar would be named hakan chaianyi (fire medicine man). He chose
this man because he represented a strong wood for making fire, and he
called it \[the altar\] fire medicine man because it was one of the
first strong things given to Iatiku. (Fire was one of the most powerful
forces and oak was the best wood for it.) So everyone in the council
agreed upon the one who was chosen, so Country Chief gave the name of
the altar to Iatiku, and said, "This is the man we have chosen."

skies and the earths in place so they will not give way or slip aside.
Skies and earths are meant to last forever and this keeps them in place.
Every year when prayer sticks are made, the broken prayer stick is
renewed, and asked to start the new year fresh again and strong. For 4
days Kapina chaianyi renew it, and repaint it. The beads are taken off
and buried and new beads put on by the new war chief.
