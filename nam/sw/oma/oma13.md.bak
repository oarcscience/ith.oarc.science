### WANDERINGS, PART IV

It happened that a man came and wanted to be a chaianyi. So Oak Man told
(him) he would be Kapina chaianyi. Oak Man asked Iatiku what this Kapina
was going to represent. Iatiku said he would represent Tiamuni (her
husband). Iatiku left it to Tiamuni to say how the altar would be made.
So Tiamuni instructed Oak Man to make a tsamai'ya <span
id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md). Tiamuni told Oak Man to gather two ears
of corn, one to represent the male (long), the other the female (small).
The male was to be named tsamaiya; the female, umahia. <span
id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_100.md) The materials needed were the same as
for making honani, except that more feathers were necessary. He was to
get feathers from as many birds of prey as possible. After this was done
Tiamuni came and instructed Oak Man how to make it up and he blew his
breath into the corn ear and closed it with cotton. It was made up like
the honani except

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

that the "seat" was abalone shell wrapped in cotton. It was then wrapped
halfway up from the bottom with buckskin ([pl. 13, fig.
2](oma46.htm#img_pl13b).md).

When Tiamuni blew in his breath he put in flesh from bashya, "kangaroo
mouse." This was the first flesh animal given Nautsiti and Iatiku to
eat. It was, therefore, to represent all animal food. This would insure
the people of always having meat. If a man wishes to go on a hunt, he
should go to his altar as it represents all food animals. Tiamuni, being
a male, the breath he blew in represented bravery, initiative, strength,
and long life.

Then Tiamuni instructed him how to make the sand painting (ha’atse
tsitiă chăn, "earth drawing") for this altar. The drawing was to be made
the same as for the honani altar excepting that tracks

of the different game animals are put on the center of the figure of the
earth, which is to be gray, and the direction colors for north, south,
east, and west are added.

The female umahia represents the "mother" of the people.

So Tiamuni taught him songs different from the ones sung before the
altar of Iatiku. This altar was not to cure the sick like that of
Iatiku, but was to give strength to the people.

The foundation of this altar is of hoak’<sup>a</sup> yaoni (sky stone)
to represent the sky. The altars in the kiva are always set on the north
side in the direction of Shipapu. As one stands facing south, on the
right side of the altar is the tsamaiya (male) and on the left is the
female (umahia) (fig. 3). The female is like a mother "guardian angel"
who represents the female instincts of maternity toward the people and
holds them in her affection and heart; the male represents power and
virility.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

Both were alike, only one was large and one, small. They were more than
a foot through and as high as a man or woman. There is nothing back of
the altar like that of Iatiku--just the two fetishes and the drawing
with the bowl in the middle.

Tiamuni told them to fast for 4 days as Iatiku had done. Everything was
done in order as Iatiku had done; Tiamuni was present to give it life.
Tiamuni told this medicine man to gather plants for medicine; they must
be hardy plants. He was to get oak balls and leaves from dyapi
(ironwood?) (rabbit sticks are made from it), leaves from witsthuich
(arrows made from it), wishuits (bows and arrows made from it). (Weapons
are made from these four trees.) These leaves and oak balls were to be
dried and ground to make medicine. Tiamuni told him also to have yucca
blades there in a basket. A woman had also \[?\] stopped to be a
chaianyi and she was to help him. Tiamuni told the medicine man that
this altar was for work during daylight. He was to fast 4 days, as in
Iatiku's instructions, and especially not to eat flesh.

When all was ready, Country Chief went to get Tiamuni. The one to be
initiated as chaianyi of this Kapina altar took Tiamuni by the hand and
seated him behind the altar. They started singing the first song of the
ceremony, this song was to give life to the medicine bowl. There was
another song about the trees of the different color-directions. Then the
chaianyi got up and with his feathers sprinkled the two fetishes as they
came to life. Then the chaianyi brought out the man and the woman who
were to be initiated. The chaianyi took some medicine in a shell and
gave some to each. Then they passed the yucca blades to Tiamuni (the
large variety, hatuni, that gives fruit of seedy brown). "Here is my
life," said Tiamuni, "with this (the yucca blades) you will clothe
yourself with manliness and with athleticism." So he gave it (the yucca)
to the man to be initiated. Tiamuni said, "Here is my mother. You will
keep our life stored here and we will be forever dependent on you and
nourishment will be from you." So Tiamuni handed the basket to the woman
who was to be Kapina chaianyi.

After they had finished with the altar it was time to bring food for the
fetishes. So Country Chief told the people and they brought food to the
door and offered it to the spirits in the different directions. After
they had gone, the ones who were to become chaianyi then ate. The
Country Chief notified the people that it was time for them to come in.
When it came time to initiate, Tiamuni came in front of the altar,
dipped the yucca blades in the medicine which had been mixed and the two
to be initiated were brought out to the tsiwaimitiima, the hollow place
with altar in kiva. Then came the song to which they were to dance on
it. At a part of the song called "héăsh" \[fog\], Tiamuni struck the man
candidate four times on the

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

back with the yucca (during this the woman and man candidates were
holding the basket between them). This was done because the basket
represented the female fetish. After the man was struck four times, it
was the woman's turn. The man held the basket and the woman was struck
four times when the "heash" part of the song came. During all this Oak
Man was back of the altar singing. This completed the initiation.

So the people were told it was their turn, the ones who had brought
feathers as offerings to the two fetishes. All came to the front with
their feathers and started to pray. The Kapina chaianyi received the
feathers from the people and started to put them in the fetishes, the
man chaianyi putting them in the male fetish and the woman, in the
female.

When all was finished another song was begun and all who had brought
feathers lined up and Tiamuni gave the yucca blades to the Kapina
chaianyi, telling him he now knew how to impart the power of the yucca
blades. Country Chief came past followed by his two helpers, each in
turn holding the basket together with the woman chaianyi, while the male
Kapina chaianyi struck each in turn four times on the back. (Nowadays
people line up to be in front of the line as the yucca does not hurt so
much at first.) That finished the ceremony and the people were allowed
to go home with instructions from Tiamuni that the altar was to be cared
for, and telling them they now knew the work it had to do. (This altar
has nothing to do with curing sickness.)
