### THE WAR-DANCE OF THE MICE

TO-NIGHT it is withered Diego <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) who
begins with his story, in the musical but strange Tée-wahn tongue, of
"Shée-choon t'o-ah-fuar." Serious as that looks, it means only "the
war-dance of the Mice."

Once upon a time there was war between the people of Isleta and the
Mice. There was a great battle, in which the Tée-wahn killed many Mice
and took their scalps. Then the Tée-wahn returned to their village, and
the warriors went into the *estufa* (sacred council-chamber) to prepare
themselves by fasting for the great scalp-dance in twelve days. While
the warriors were sitting inside, the Mice came secretly by night to
attack the town, and their spies crept up to the *estufa*. When all the
Tée-wahn warriors had fallen asleep, the Mice came stealing down the big
ladder into the room, and creeping from sleeper to sleeper, they gnawed
every bowstring and cut the feathers from the arrows and the strap of
every sling. When this was done, the Mice raised a terrible war-whoop
and rushed upon the warriors, brandishing their

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

spears. The Tée-wahn woke and caught up their bows and arrows, but only
to find them useless. So the warriors could do nothing but run from
their tiny foes, and up the ladder to the roof they rushed pell-mell and
thence fled to their homes, leaving the Mice victorious.

The rest of the town made such fun of the warriors that they refused to
return to the fight; and the elated Mice held a public dance in front of
the *estufa*. A brave sight it was, the army of these little people,
singing and dancing and waving their spears. They were dressed in red
blankets, with leather leggings glistening with silver buttons from top
to bottom, and gay moccasins. Each had two eagle feathers tied to the
top of his spear-the token of victory. And as they danced and marched
and counter-marched, they sang exultingly:

*Shée-oh-pah ch'-ót-im!  
Neh-máh-hlee-oh ch'-ot-im!  
Hló-tu feé-ny p'-óh-teh!*

over and over again--which means

Quick we cut the bowstring!  
Quick we cut the sling-strap!  
We shaved the arrow-feathers off!

For four days they danced and sang, and on the night of the fourth day
danced all night around a big bonfire. The next morning they marched
away. That was the time when the Mice conquered men; and that is the
reason why we have never been able to drive the Mice out of our homes to
this day.

"Is *that* the reason?" ask all the boys, who have been listening with
big black eyes intent.

"That is the very reason," says withered Diego.

Now, *compadre* Antonio, there is a tail to you." Antonio, thus called
upon, cannot refuse. Indian etiquette is very strict upon this point--as
well as upon all others. So he fishes in his memory for a story, while
the boys turn expectant faces toward him. He is not nearly so wrinkled
as Diego, but he is very, very old, and his voice is a little tremulous
at first. Wrapping his blanket about him, he begins:

Then I will tell you why the Coyote and the Blackbirds are enemies--for
once they were very good friends in the old days.
