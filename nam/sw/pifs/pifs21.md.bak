### THE MOQUI <span id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_71.md) BOY AND THE EAGLE

SOME of the folk-stories told in Isleta were evidently invented in other
pueblos, whence the Tée-wahn have learned them in their trading-trips.
There is even a story from the far-off towns of Moqui, three hundred
miles west of here and ninety miles from the railroad. The Moquis live
in northeast Arizona, in strange adobe towns, <span
id="fr_72"></span>[2](#fn_72.md) perched upon impregnable islands of rock,
rising far above the bare, brown plain. They are seldom visited and
little known by white men. All the other Pueblo towns and tribes have
changed somewhat in the present era of American occupation; but the
Moquis remain very much as they were when the first Spaniard found
them--three hundred and fifty years ago. They retain many customs long
extinct among their kindred, and have some of which no trace is to be
found elsewhere. One of the minor differences, but one which would be
almost the first to strike a stranger, is the absence of captive eagles
in Moqui; and this is explained by the following folk-story:

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

The Eagle is Kah-báy-deh (commander) of all that flies, and his feathers
are strongest in medicine.

So long ago that no man can tell how long, there lived in Moqui an old
man and an old woman, who had two children--a boy and a girl. The boy,
whose name was Tái-oh, had a pet Eagle, of which he was very fond; and
the Eagle loved its young master. Despite his youth, Tái-oh was a
capital hunter; and every day he brought home not only rabbits enough
for the family, but also to keep the Eagle well fed.

One day when he was about to start on a hunt, he asked his sister to
look out for the Eagle during his absence. No sooner was he out of sight
than the girl began to upbraid the bird bitterly, saying: "How I hate
you, for my brother loves you so much. If it were not for you, he would
give me many more rabbits, but now you eat them up."

The Eagle, feeling the injustice of this, was angry; so when she brought
him a rabbit for breakfast the Eagle turned his head and looked at it
sidewise, and would not touch it. At noon, when she brought him his
dinner, he did the same thing; and at night, when Tái-oh returned, the
Eagle told him all that had happened.

"Now," said the Eagle, "I am very tired of staying always here in Moqui,
and I want to go home to visit my people a little. Come and go along
with me, that you may see where the Eagle-people live."

"It is well," replied Tái-oh. "To-morrow morning we will go together."

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

In the morning they all went out into the fields, far down in the
valley, to hoe their corn, leaving Tái-oh at home.

"Now," said the Eagle, "untie this thong from my leg, friend, and get
astride my neck, and we will go."

The string was soon untied, and Tái-oh got astride the neck of the great
bird, which rose up into the air as though it carried no weight at all.
It circled over the town a long time, and the people cried out with
wonder and fear at seeing an Eagle with a boy on his back. Then they
sailed out over the fields, where Tái-oh's parents and his sister were
at work; and all the three began to cry, and went home in great sorrow.

The Eagle kept soaring up and up until they came to the very sky. There
in the blue was a little door, through which the Eagle flew. Alighting
on the floor of the sky, he let Tái-oh down from his back, and said:

"Now, you wait here, friend, while I go and see my people," and off he
flew.

Tái-oh waited three days, and still the Eagle did not return; so he
became uneasy and started out to see what he could find. After wandering
a long way, he met an old Spider-woman.

"Where are you going, my son?" she asked.

"I am trying to find my friend, the Eagle."

"Very well, then, I will help you. Come into my house."

"But how can I come into so small a door?" objected Tái-oh.

"Just put your foot in, and it will open big enough for you to enter."

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

So Tái-oh put his foot in, and, sure enough, the door opened wide, and
he went into the Spider's house and sat down.

"Now," said she, "you will have some trouble in getting to the house of
your friend, the Eagle, for to get there you will have to climb a
dreadful ladder. It is well that you came to me for help, for that
ladder is set with sharp arrow-heads and knives of flint, so that if you
tried to go up it, it would cut your legs off. But I will give you this
sack of sacred herbs to help you. When you come to the ladder, you must
chew some of the herbs and spit the juice on the ladder, which will at
once become smooth for you." <span id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_73.md)

Tái-oh thanked the Spider-woman and started off with the sack. After
awhile he came to the foot of a great ladder, which went away up out of
sight. Its sides and rungs were bristling with keen arrow-heads, so that
no living thing could climb it; but when Tái-oh chewed some of the magic
herb and spat upon the ladder, all the sharp points fell off, and it was
so smooth that he climbed it without a single scratch.

After a long, long climb, he came to the top of the ladder, and stepped
upon the roof of the Eagles' house. But when he came to the door he
found it so bristling with arrow-points that whoever might try to enter
would be cut to pieces. Again he chewed some of the herb, and spat upon
the door;

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

and at once all the points fell off, and he entered safely, and inside
he found his Eagle-friend, and all the Eagle-people. His friend had
fallen in love with an Eagle-girl and married her, and that was the
reason he had not returned sooner.

Tái-oh stayed there some time, being very nicely entertained, and
enjoyed himself greatly in the strange sky-country. At last one of the
wise old Eagle-men came to him and said:

"Now, my son, it is well that you go home, for your parents are very
sad, thinking you are dead. After this, whenever you seen an Eagle
caught and kept captive, you must let it go; for now you have been in
our country, and know that when we come home we take off our
feather-coats and are people like your own."

So Tái-oh went to his Eagle-friend and said he thought he must go home.

"Very well," said the Eagle; "get on my neck and shut your eyes, and we
will go."

So he got on, and they went down out of the sky, and down and down until
at last they came to Moqui. There the Eagle let Tái-oh down among the
wondering people, and, bidding him an affectionate good-by, flew off to
his young wife in the sky.

Tái-oh went to his home loaded down with dried meat and tanned buckskin,
which the Eagle had given him; and there was great rejoicing, for all
had given him up as dead. And this is why, to this very day, the Moquis
will not keep an Eagle captive, though nearly all the other Pueblo towns
have all the Eagle-prisoners they can get.

superstition of the Peruvian mountain Indians, ancient and modern. The
latter I have often seen throwing upon a stone at the crest of a
mountain pass the quid of coca-leaves they had been chewing. They
believe such use of this sacred herb propitiates the spirits and keeps
off the terrible *sorache*, or mountain-sickness; and that it also makes
veins of metal easier to be worked--softening the stone, even as it did
for Tái-oh.
