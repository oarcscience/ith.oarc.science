### THE MAN WHO WOULD N'T KEEP SUNDAY

AMONG the folk-stories of the Pueblos which show at once that they are
not of such antiquity as the rest, is this. It is plain that the story
is post-Spanish--that it has been invented within the last three hundred
and fifty years. That seems to us a long time to go back in the history
of America, but to the Pueblos it is a trifling dot on the long line of
their antiquity.

The following tale is an amusing instance of the fashion in which some
of the myth-makers have mixed things. It is an Indian fairy tale, but
with a Christian moral--which was learned from the noble and effective
Spanish missionaries who toiled here.

Once upon a time, in a pueblo south of Isleta,--one of its old colonies
known as P'ah-que-tóo-ai, the Rainbow Town, but deserted long
ago,--there were two Indians who were great friends. They started in
life with equal prospects, married young, and settled in the same town.
But though friends, their natures were very different. One was a good
man in his heart, and the other was bad. The good man always observed
Sunday, but the other

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

worked every day. The good man had better luck than the bad; and the
latter became jealous. At last he said: "Friend, tell me, why is it that
you always make more success than I?"

"Perhaps," answered Good, "because I keep Sunday, but work hard all the
other days of the week, while you work every day."

Time went on, and both the friends accumulated considerable wealth in
servants, stock, and ornaments. The good man let his servants rest on
Sunday, but the bad made his work every day, and did not even give them
time to smoke. Good prospered most, and had more servants, more stock,
and more ornaments than Bad, who grew more jealous daily. At last Bad
said to Good: "Friend, you say that you have good luck because you keep
Sunday, but I'll bet I am right in *not* keeping it."

"No," replied Good; "I'll bet *I* am right, and that Sunday ought to be
kept."

"Then I will bet all my stock against all your stock, and all my lands
against your lands, and everything we have except our wives. To-morrow,
be ready about breakfast-time, and we will go out into the public road
and ask the first three men we meet which of us is right. And whichever
gets the voice of the majority, he shall be the winner, and shall take
all that is of the other."

Good agreed,--for an Indian cannot back out of a challenge,--and so the
next morning the two friends took the public road. In a little while
they met a man, and said to him: "Friend, we want your voice. Which of
us is right, the one who

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

observes Sunday and lets his *peons* rest then, or he who does not?"

Now it happened that this person was not a man, but an old devil who was
taking a walk in human form; and he promptly answered: "Without doubt he
is right who does not keep Sunday," and went his road.

"Aha!" said Bad to Good. "You see I got the first voice."

They started on again and soon met another man, to whom they asked the
same. But it was the same old devil, and he gave them the same answer.

"Aha!" said Bad. "Now I have the second voice, you see."

Presently they met a third man, and asked him the same, and he answered
the same; for it was the same old devil in another body.

"Aha!" said Bad, "I am the winner! Get down from that burro, and let me
have her and her colt, for now all that was yours is mine, as we
agreed."

Good got down from the burro with tears in his eyes, for he was thinking
of his wife, and said:

"Now, friend, having gained all, you are going back to our home; but I
shall not. Tell my wife that I am going to the next pueblo to seek work,
and that I will not be back until I have earned as much as I have lost
in this bet, or more; but tell her not to be sad."

Then they shook hands and parted, Bad riding home full of joy, and Good
trudging off through the sand toward Isleta, which was the largest and
wealthiest pueblo of the tribe. On the road night

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

overtook him, and seeing an abandoned house in a field, he hastened to
it for shelter from the cold of night. A portion of the roof still
remained, with the *fogon* (corner fireplace) and chimney, and he began
to brush a place to lie down. Now it happened that this house was the
place where all the devils of that country used to meet at night; and
before Good went to sleep he heard noises of the devils coming. He was
very much frightened, and to hide himself climbed up into the chimney
and stood upon its crosspiece.

In a moment the devils began to arrive singly or in pairs; and at last
came the old devil--the very one who had played the trick on Good. He
called the meeting to order, and asked them what they had been doing. A
young devil arose and said:

"The next pueblo is the largest and wealthiest of this nation. For three
weeks now, all its people, and all the people along that river, have
been working at the spring from which the river comes, but have not been
able to undo me. Three weeks ago I came to that spring and thought how
nice it would be to stop up the spring, and how the people would swear
if their gods did not send rain. So I stuck a big stone in the spring
and stopped all the water; and ever since, the water will not come out,
and the people work in vain, and they are dying of thirst, and all their
stock. Now they will either forsake their gods and serve us, or die like
the animals, thinking nothing of their past or future."

"Good!" said the old devil, rubbing his hands. "You have done well! But
tell me--is there no way to open the spring?"

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

"There is only one way," said the young devil, "and one man could do
that--but they will never think of it. If a man took a long stick,
shaped like a sword, and went and stood on top of the stone, and struck
it with the full length of the stick first east and west, and then north
and south, the water would come out so hard that the stone would be
thrown out upon the banks and the spring could never be stopped again."

"Is *that* the only way?" said the old devil. "You have done very well,
for they certainly will never think to do that. Now for the next."

Then another young devil arose and reported this:

"I, too, have done something. In the pueblo across the mountain I have
the daughter of the wealthiest man sick in bed, and she will never get
well. All the medicine-men have tried in vain to cure her. She, too,
will be ours."

"Good!" said the old devil. "But is there no way in which any one may
cure her?"

"Yes, there is one way, but they never will think of that. If a person
should carry her to the door just as the sun is rising, and hold her so
that its very first rays would touch the top of her head, she would be
well at once, and never could be made sick again."

"You are right," said the old devil, "they will never think of that. You
have done well."

Just then a rooster crowed, and the old devil cried, "You have a
road!"--which means, "an adjournment is in order." All the devils
hurried away; and when they were gone, poor Good crawled down from the
chimney half dead with fright, and hurried on toward Isleta. When he

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

got there he found the people in great trouble, for their crops were
withering and their cattle dying for want of water.

"I see," thought Good to himself, "that these devils told the truth
about one thing, and so perhaps they did about all. I will try to undo
them, even if I fail." Going to the Cacique he asked what they would
give him if he would open the spring. The Cacique told the
*principales*, and they held a *junta*, and decided to let the stranger
name his own price.

"Well," said he, "I will do this if you will give me half the value of
the whole village."

They agreed, and asked how many men he would need to help him, and when
he would begin.

"I need no men. Lend me only a hard stick the length of my outstretched
arms, and a horse."

These were given him, and he went to the spring alone. Leaping upon the
stone he struck it with the full length of the stick east and west, and
then north and south, and sprang nimbly to the bank. At that very
instant the water rushed out harder than it had ever done. All the
people and cattle along the river came to the banks and drank and
revived. They began to irrigate their fields again, and the dying crops
grew green. <span id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_82.md) When Good got back to
the pueblo, half of all the grain and money

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

and dresses and ornaments were piled up in a huge pile waiting for him,
and half the horses and cattle and sheep were waiting in big herds. It
was so that he had to hire a great many men to help him home with his
wealth, which was more than any one person ever had before. He appointed
a mayordomo to take charge of this caravan, and to meet him at a certain
point on the way home. He himself, taking a horse, rode away at once to
the other pueblo, where the rich man's daughter was sick. Arriving at
nightfall, he stopped at the house of an old woman. While he ate, she
told him how sad was all the village; for the girl who had been so kind
to all was dying.

"But," said he "I can cure her."

"*In-dah*," said the crone; "for all the medicine-men have tried vainly,
and how shall you?"

"But I can," he insisted; and at last the old woman went to the rich
man, and said there was a stranger at her house who was sure he could
cure the girl.

The *rico* said: "Go and tell him to come here quickly," and the old
woman did so. When Good came, the rich man said: "Are you he who says he
can cure my daughter?"

"I am the one."

"For how much will you cure her? What will you give?"

"Half of all I have, which is much."

"It is well. To-morrow be ready, for I will come just before the sun."

In the blue of the morning Good came and waked the girl, and carried her
to the door. In a

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

moment came the sun, and its first ray fell upon her bent head. In an
instant she was perfectly well, and stronger and prettier than ever.

That very day her father gladly divided all his wealth into two equal
shares, and gave half to Good, who again had to hire many cow-boys and
men with *carretas* to help him transport all this. At the appointed
spot he found his mayordomo; and putting all the stock together, with
many herders, and all the wagons full of corn and dresses and ornaments
and money together, started homeward, sending ahead a messenger on a
beautiful horse to apprise his wife.

When the jealous Bad saw this fine horse going to the house of his
friend, he ran over to see what it meant; and while he was still there,
Good arrived with all his wealth. Filled with envy, Bad asked him where
he had got all this; and Good told the whole story.

"Well," said Bad, "I will go there too, and perhaps I will hear
something." So off he rode on the burro he had won from Good, till he
came to the deserted house, and climbed up in the chimney.

Soon the devils met, and the two young ones told their chief that the
spring had been opened and the girl cured, and that neither could ever
be bewitched again.

"Somebody must have listened to us last night," said the old devil,
greatly troubled. "Search the house." In a little while they found the
jealous friend in the chimney, and supposing him to be the one who had
undone them, without mercy puffed him to the place where devils live.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_82"></span>[166:1](pifs26.htm#fr_83.md) Here, as in several
other stories in this volume, is a touch of the and character of the
Southwest. The country is always so dry that irrigation is necessary in
farming, and in very bad years the streams have not water even for that.
The Rio Grande itself frequently disappears in September between certain
points in its course in sandy New Mexico; and within ten miles below
Isleta I have seen its bed bone-dry. Ignorance of this fact has caused
serious blunders on the part of historians unfamiliar with the country
of which they wrote.
