### THE MOTHER MOON

AND do you know why it is that the Moon has but one eye? It is a short
story, but one of the most poetic and beautiful in all the pretty
folklore of the Pueblos.

P'áh-hlee-oh, the Moon-Maiden, was the Tée-wahn Eve <span
id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_38.md)--the first and loveliest woman in all the
world. She had neither father nor mother, sister nor brother; and in her
fair form were the seeds of all humanity--of all life and love and
goodness. The Trues, who are the unseen spirits that are above all, made
T'hoor-íd-deh, the Sun, who was to be father of all things; and because
he was alone, they made for him a companion, the first to be of maids,
the first to be a wife. From them began the world and all that is in it;
and all their children were strong and good. Very happy were the
Father-all and the Mother-all, as they watched their happy brood. He
guarded them by day and

she by night--only there *was* no night, for then the Moon had two eyes,
and saw as clearly as the Sun, and with glance as bright. It was all as
one long day of golden light. The birds flew always, the flowers never
shut, the young people danced and sang, and none knew how to rest.

But at last the Trues thought better. For the endless light grew heavy
to the world's young eyes that knew no tender lids of night. And the
Trues said:

"It is not well, for so there is no sleep, and the world is very tired.
We must not keep the Sun and Moon seeing alike. Let us put out one of
his eyes, that there may be darkness for half the time, and then his
children can rest." And they called T'hoor-íd-deh and P'áh-hlee-oh
before them to say what must be done.

But when she heard that, the Moon-Mother wept for her strong and
handsome husband, and cried:

"No! No! Take my eyes, for my children, but do not blind the Sun! He is
the father, the provider--and how shall he watch against harm, or how
find us game without his bright eyes? Blind me, and keep him
all-seeing."

And the Trues said: "It is well, daughter." And so they took away one of
her eyes, so that she could never see again so well. Then night came
upon the tired earth, and the flowers and birds and people slept their
first sleep, and it was very good. But she who first had the love of
children, and paid for them with pain as mother's pay, she did not grow
ugly by her sacrifice. Nay,

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

she is lovelier than ever, and we all love her to this day. For the
Trues are good to her, and gave her in place of the bloom of girlhood
the beauty that is only in the faces of mothers.

So mother-pale above us  
  She bends, her watch to keep,  
Who of her sight dear-bought the night  
  To give her children sleep.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_38"></span>[71:1](pifs12.htm#fr_38.md) She is honored in
almost every detail of the Pueblo ceremonials. The most important charm
or implement of the medicine-men, the holiest fetish of all, is typical
of her. It is called Mah-pah-róo, the Mother, and is the most beautiful
article a Pueblo ever fashioned. A flawless ear of pure white corn (a
type of fertility or motherhood) is tricked out with a downy mass of
snow-white feathers, and hung with ornaments of silver, coral, and the
precious turquoise.
