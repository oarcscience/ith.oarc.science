### THE HUNGRY GRANDFATHERS

A DISOBEDIENT child is something I have never seen among the Pueblos, in
all the years I have lived with them. The parents are very kind, too. My
little *amigos* in Isleta and the other Pueblo towns--for they are my
friends in all--are never spoiled; but neither are they punished
much. <span id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_102.md) Personal acquaintance with a
spanking is what very few of them have. The idea of obedience is inborn
and inbred. A word is generally enough; and for extreme cases it only
needs the threat: "Look out, or I will send for the Grandfathers!"

Now, perhaps you do not know who the Grandfathers are; but every Pueblo
youngster does. It has nothing to do with the "truly" grandpa, who is as
lovely an institution among the Tée-wahn as anywhere else. No, the
*Abuelos* were of an altogether different sort. That name is Spanish,
and has three applications in Isleta: real grandparents; the remarkable
masked officials of a certain dance; and the bad Old Ones. These last

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

are called in the Tée-wahn tongue *T'ai-kár-nin* (Those-Who-Eat-People).
They were, in fact, aboriginal Ogres, who once sadly ravaged Isleta.

The *T'ai-kár-nin* had no town, but dwelt in caves of the lava mountain
a couple of miles west of this village--the *Kú-mai* hill. It is a bad
place at best: bleak, black, rough, and forbidding--just the place that
a properly constituted Ogre would choose for his habitation. In the
first place, it is to the west of the town, which is "bad medicine" in
itself to any Indian, for that point of the compass belongs to the dead
and to bad spirits. Then its color is against it; and, still worse, it
is to this day the common stamping-ground of all the witches in this
part of the country, where they gather at night for their diabolical
caucuses. Of its serious disrepute I can convey no better idea to the
enlightened and superstition less American mind than by saying that it
is a sort of aboriginal "haunted house."

So the hill of *Kú-mai* was a peculiarly fit place for the Ogres to
dwell in. Deep in its gloomy bowels they huddled on the white sand which
floors all the caves there; and crannies overhead carried away the smoke
from their fires, which curled from crevices at the top of the peak far
above them. Ignorant Americans would probably have taken it for a
volcanic emission; but the good people of Shee-eh-whíb-bak knew better.

These Ogres were larger than ordinary men, but otherwise carried no
outward sign of their odious calling. Their teeth were just like
anybody's good teeth, and they had neither "tushes" nor

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

horns nor hoofs. Indeed, except for their unusual size, they would have
been easily mistaken for Indians of some distant tribe. But, *ay de mi!*
How strong they were! One could easily whip five common men in a
bunch--"men even as strong as my son, Francisco," says Desiderio; and
Francisco is as stout as a horse.

They were people of very fastidious palates, these Ogres. Nothing was
good enough for them except human flesh--and young at that. Their fare
was entirely baby--baby young, baby brown, and baby very fat. They never
molested the adults; but as often as they found an appetite they
descended upon the village, scooped up what children they could lay
their hands upon, and carried them off to their caves. There they had
enormous *ollas*, into which half a dozen children could be thrown at
once.

There seemed to be some spell about these Ogres--besides their frequent
hungry spells--for the Pueblos, who were so brave in the face of other
foes, never dared fight these terrible cave-dwellers. They continued to
devastate the village, until babies were at a premium, and few to be had
at any price; and the only way the people dared to try to circumvent
them was by strategy. In time it came about that every house where there
were children, or a reasonable hope of them, had secret cubby-holes back
of the thick adobe walls; with little doors which shut flush with the
wall and were also plastered with adobe, so that when they were shut a
stranger--even if he were a sharp-eyed Indian--would never dream of
their existence. \[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

And whenever arose the dreaded cry, "Here come the *T'ai-kár-nin*!" the
children were hustled, shivering and noiseless, into the secret
recesses, and the doors were shut. Then Mr. Ogre could come in and peer
and sniff about as he liked, but no chance to fill his market-basket
could he find. And when parents were forced to go away and leave the
babies behind, the poor young ones were inclosed in their safe but
gloomy prisons, and there in darkness and silence had to await the
parental home-coming. These inconveniences were gladly borne, however,
since they preserved the children--and we all know that preserved baby
is better than baby-stew. It was, of course, rather rough on the Ogres,
who began to find all their belts most distressfully loose; but no one
seemed to consider their feelings. They were pretty well starved when
the Spaniards came and delivered the suffering Isleteños by driving off
these savage neighbors. This looks suspiciously as if the whole myth of
the Ogres had sprung from the attacks of the cruel Apaches and Navajos
in the old days.

There was one queer thing about these Ogres on their forages they always
wore buckskin masks, just like those of the *Abuelos* of the sacred
dance. Their bare faces were seen sometimes by hunters who encountered
them on the *llano*, but never here in town. It was in connection with
these masks that Isleta had a great sensation recently. The Hungry
Grandfathers had been almost forgotten, except as a word to change: the
minds of children who had about quarter of a mind to be naughty; but
interest was revived by a discovery

<span id="page_219 ">p. 219</span>

of which my venerable friend Desiderio Peralta was the hero.

This dear old man--news of his death has come to me as I write this very
chapter--was a remarkable character. He was one of "the oldest
inhabitants" of New Mexico--older than any other Indian among the twelve
hundred of Isleta, except tottering Diego; and that is saying a great
deal. His hair was very gray, and his kindly old face such an incredible
mass of wrinkles that I used to fancy Father Time himself must have
said: "No, no! You apprentices never do a thing right! Here, *this* is
the way to put on wrinkles!" and that he then and there took old
Desiderio, for a model, and showed the journeymen wrinkle-makers a trick
they never dreamed of. Certainly the job was never so well done before.
From chin to hair-roots, from ear to ear, was such a crowded, tangled,
inextricable maze of furrows and cross-harrow lines as I firmly believe
never dwelt together on any other one human face. Why, Desiderio, could
have furnished an army of old men with wrinkles! I never saw him smile
without fearing that some of those wrinkles were going to fall off the
edge, so crowded were they at best!

But if his face was *arrugada*, his brain was not. He was bright and
chipper as a young blackbird, and it was only of late that a touch of
rheumatism took the youth out of his legs. Until recently he held the
important position of Captain of War for the pueblo; and only two years
ago I had the pleasure of going with two hundred *other* Indians on a
huge rabbit-hunt which was under his personal

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

supervision, and in which he was as active as any one, both on his feet
and with the unerring boomerang. His eyes were good to find about as
much through the sights of a rifle as anybody's; and on the whole he was
worth a good deal more than I expect to be some seventy years from now.
He was a good neighbor, too; and I had few pleasanter hours than those
spent in talking with this genial old shrivel, who was *muy sabio* in
all the folk-lore and wisdom of his unfathomable race; and very
close-mouthed about it, too--as they all are. Still, there were some
things which he seemed willing to confide to me; and he always had. an
attentive listener.

Desiderio was not yet too old to herd his own cattle during the season
when they roam abroad; and, while thus engaged, he made a discovery
which set the whole quiet village agog, though no other outsider ever
heard of it.

One day in 1889 Desiderio started out from the village, driving his
cattle. Having steered them across the *acequia* and up the sand-hills
to the beginning of the plain, he climbed to the top of the *Kú-mai* to
watch them through the day--as has been the custom of Isleta herders
from time immemorial. In wandering over the rocky top of the peak, he
came to a ledge of rocks on the southeast spur of the hill; and there
found a fissure, at one end of which was a hole as large as a man's
head. Desiderio put his face and his wrinkles down to the hole to see
what he could see; and all was dark inside. But if his eyes strained in
vain, his ears did not. From far down in the bowels of the

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

mountain came a strange roaring, as of a heavy wind. Desiderio was
somewhat dismayed at this; for he knew at once that he had found one of
the chimneys of the Ogres; but he did not run away. Hunting around
awhile, he found in the fissures of the rocks some ancient buckskin
masks--the very ones worn by the Ogres, of course. He put them back, and
coming to town straightway told the medicine-men of the Black Eyes--one
of the two parties here. They held a *junta*; and after mature
deliberation decided to go and get the masks. This was done, and the
masks are now treasured in the Black Eye medicine-house.

I have several times carefully explored the *Kú-mai*--a difficult and
tiresome task, thanks to the knife-like lava fragments which cover it
everywhere, and which will cut a pair of new strong shoes to pieces in
an afternoon. It is true that in this hill of bad repute there are
several lava-caves, with floors of white sand blown in from the *llano*;
and that in these caves there are a few human bones. No doubt some of
the savage nomads camped or lived there. None of those famous *ollas*
are visible; nor have I ever been able to find any other relics of the
Hungry Grandfathers.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_102"></span>[215:1](pifs33.htm#fr_103.md) must qualify this
now. In the last two years I have seen one spoiled child--just one, in
ten years' acquaintance with 9000 Pueblos!
