This is a collection of stories from the Isleta Pueblo people of New
Mexico. Charles Lummis \[1859-1928\] was a pioneering writer,
photographer, amateur anthropologist and adventurer who, according to
himself, invented the term 'The Southwest'. In 1884, Lummis took a hike
from Cincinnati to Los Angeles, which he later chronicled in his
best-selling book, *A Tramp Across the Continent* (1892). In 1885, he
became city editor for the *Los Angeles Times*, and later covered the
Apache wars in Arizona. In 1888, Lummis suffered a stroke. To
convalesce, he moved to New Mexico, where he embedded himself in Pueblo
culture and collected the stories in this book. This was originally
published as *The Man Who Married the Moon* in 1894, and revised and
enlarged as the present text in 1910. Lumis moved back to Los Angeles,
where he made his home, *El Alisal*, and founded the Southwest Museum in
1914, at the foot of Mount Washington in East Los Angeles. He also
helped restore the Spanish missions in California.
