<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE STONE-MOVING SONG</H3>
<P>THE Horned Toad is also a famous musician--a sort of Pueblo Orpheus, whose song charms the very stones and trees. A short folk-story of Isleta refers to this.</P>
<P>One day Qu&aacute;h-le-kee-ra&iacute;-deh was working in his field. There were many very large rocks, and to move them he sang a strong song as he pulled:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>Yah &eacute;h-ah, h&eacute;h-ah h&aacute;y-na,<BR>
Yah, &eacute;h-ah, heh-ah hay-na,<BR>
Wha-na&iacute;-kee-ay hee-e-wid-deh<BR>
Ah-kwe-&eacute;e-hee ai-y&eacute;n-cheh,<BR>
Yahb-k'y&aacute;y-queer ah-ch&oacute;o-hee</I>.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>When he sang this and touched the heaviest stone, it rose up from the ground, and went over his head and fell far behind him.</P>
<P>While he worked so, Too-wh&aacute;y-deh came along; and seeing what happened, he wished to meddle, as his way is. So he said:</P>
<P>"Friend Qu&aacute;h-le-kee-ra&iacute;-deh, let <I>me</I> do it."</P>
<P>"No, friend," said the Horned Toad. "It is better for every one to do what he knows, and not to put himself in the work of others."</P>

<P>"Do not think so," answered the Coyote. "For I can do this also. It is very easy."</P>
<P>"It is well, then--but see that you are not afraid; for so it will be bad."</P>
<P>Too-wh&aacute;y-deh laid off his blanket and took hold of the largest rock there was, and sang the song. When he sang, the rock rose up in the air to go over his head; but he, being scared, ducked his head. Then at once the rock fell on him, and he had no bones left. Then the Horned Toad laughed, and gave the enemy-yell (war-whoop), saying: "We do this to one another!"</P>
