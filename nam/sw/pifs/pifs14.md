### THE STONE-MOVING SONG

THE Horned Toad is also a famous musician--a sort of Pueblo Orpheus,
whose song charms the very stones and trees. A short folk-story of
Isleta refers to this.

One day Quáh-le-kee-raí-deh was working in his field. There were many
very large rocks, and to move them he sang a strong song as he pulled:

*Yah éh-ah, héh-ah háy-na,  
Yah, éh-ah, heh-ah hay-na,  
Wha-naí-kee-ay hee-e-wid-deh  
Ah-kwe-ée-hee ai-yén-cheh,  
Yahb-k'yáy-queer ah-chóo-hee*.

When he sang this and touched the heaviest stone, it rose up from the
ground, and went over his head and fell far behind him.

While he worked so, Too-wháy-deh came along; and seeing what happened,
he wished to meddle, as his way is. So he said:

"Friend Quáh-le-kee-raí-deh, let *me* do it."

"No, friend," said the Horned Toad. "It is better for every one to do
what he knows, and not to put himself in the work of others."

"Do not think so," answered the Coyote. "For I can do this also. It is
very easy."

"It is well, then--but see that you are not afraid; for so it will be
bad."

Too-wháy-deh laid off his blanket and took hold of the largest rock
there was, and sang the song. When he sang, the rock rose up in the air
to go over his head; but he, being scared, ducked his head. Then at once
the rock fell on him, and he had no bones left. Then the Horned Toad
laughed, and gave the enemy-yell (war-whoop), saying: "We do this to one
another!"
