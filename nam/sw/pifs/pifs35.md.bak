### DOCTOR FIELD-MOUSE

IT was the evening of the 14th of March. In the valley of the Rio
Grande, that stands at the end of the winter. Now it is to open the big
mother-canal that comes from the river to all the fields, giving them to
drink after their long thirst; and now to plow the *milpas*, and to
uncover the buried grape-vines, and make ready for the farmer's work.

As the door opened to admit stalwart Francisco to the big flickering
room where we were all sitting in silence, the long, shrill wail of a
Coyote, away up on the Accursed Hill, blew in after him on the
boisterous March wind. The boys pricked up their ears; and bright-faced
Manuelito <span id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_108.md) turned to his
white-headed grandfather, and said:

"*Tata*, why is it that Too-wháy-deh always howls so? Perhaps he has a
pain; for he has been crying ever since the beginning of the world--as
they told us in the story of the Fawns and the She-Wolf."

"What, Unknowing!" answered the old man, kindly. "Hast thou never heard
of the Coyote's

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

toothache, and who was the first medicine-man in all the world? It is
not well not to know that; for from that comes all that we know to cure
the sick. And for that, I will tell-but it is the last story of the
year. For to-morrow is *Tu-shée-wim*, the Spring Medicine-Dance; and the
snakes are coming out from their winter houses. After that, we must not
tell of the Things of Old. For it is very long ago; and if one made a
mistake in telling, and said that which was not all true,
*Ch'áh-rah-ráh-deh* would bite him, and he would die. <span
id="fr_110"></span>[1](#fn_109.md) But this one I will tell thee."

 

In the First Days, when the people had broken through the crust of the
earth, and had come up out of their dark prison, underground, and
crossed Shee-p'ah-póon, the great Black Lake of Tears, they came to the
shore on this side. Then it came that all the animals were made; and
very soon the Coyote was sent by the Trues to carry a buckskin bag far
south, and not to open it until he should come to the Peak of the White
Clouds. For many days he ran south, with the bag on his back. But there
was nothing to eat, and he grew very hungry. At last he thought:
"Perhaps in this bag there is to eat." So he took it from his back, and
untied the thongs, and looked in. But there was nothing in it except the
stars; and as soon as the bag was opened they all flew up into the sky,
where they are to this day.

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

When the Trues saw that Too-wháy-deh had disobeyed, they were angry, and
made it that his punishment should be to wander up and down forever,
howling with the toothache and finding no rest.

So Too-wháy-deh went out with his toothache, running all over the world
groaning and crying; and when the other four-feet slept he could only
sit and howl. Because he came to talk with the other animals, if they
could not cure him, they caught the toothache too; and that is the
reason why they sometimes cry. But none have it like the Coyote, who can
find no rest.

In those times there were no medicine-men in the world,--not even of the
people,--and the animals found no cure.

Time passing so, it came one day that T'hoo-chée-deh, the smallest of
Mice, who lives in the little mounds around the chapparo-bush, was
making his road underground, when he came to a kind of root with a sweet
smell. T'hoo-chée-deh was very wise; and he took the root, and put it
with others in a buckskin pouch he carried under his left arm.

In a few days Kee-oo-ée-deh, the Prairie-Dog, came with his head all fat
with toothache, and said:

"Friend Field-Mouse, can you not cure me of this pain? For all say you
are very wise with herbs."

"I do not know," answered T'hoo-chée-deh. "But we will try. For I have
found a new root, and perhaps it is good."

So he mixed it with other roots, all pounded, and put it on the cheek of
Kee-oo-ée-deh; and in a little, the toothache was gone.

In that time it was that there was so much

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

toothache among the animals that the Mountain Lion, Commander of Beasts,
called a council to see what should be done. When every kind that walks
on the ground had met, he asked each of them if they had found no cure;
but none of them knew any. The Coyote was there, howling with pain; but
all the other sick were at home.

At last it was to the Field-Mouse, who is the smallest of all animals,
and who did not wish to seem wise until all the greater ones had spoken.
When the Mountain Lion said, "And thou, T'hoo-chée-deh--hast thou a
cure?" he rose in his place and came forward modestly, saying: "If the
others will allow me, and with the help of the Trues, I will try what I
found last."

Then he drew from his left-hand bag the roots one by one; and last of
all, the root of the chee-ma-hár, explaining what it had done for
Kee-oo-ée-deh. He pounded it to powder with a stone, and mixed it with
fat; and spreading it on flat leaves, put it to the Coyote's jaw. And in
a little the pain was gone. <span id="fr_111"></span>[1](#fn_110.md)

At that the Mountain Lion, the Bear, the Buffalo, and all the other
Captains of Four-feet, declared T'hoo-chée-deh the
Father-of-All-Medicine. They made a strong law that from that time the
body of the Field-Mouse should be held sacred, so that no animal dares
to kill him or even to touch him dead. And so it remains to this day.
But only the

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

birds and the snakes, who were not at the Council of the Four- feet,
they do not respect T'hoo-chée-deh.

So the Field-Mouse was the first medicine-man. He chose one of each kind
of four-feet to be his assistants, and taught them the use of all herbs,
and how to cure pain, so that each might practise among his own
people--a Bear-doctor for the Bears, and a Wolf-doctor for the Wolves,
and so to all the tribes of the animals.

Of those he taught, there was one who was not a True Believer--the
Badger. But he listened also, and made as if he believed all. With time,
the teaching was done; and T'hoo-chée-deh sent all his assistant doctors
home to their own peoples to heal. But whenever one of them was asked
with the sacred corn-meal <span id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_111.md) to come
and cure a sick one, he always came first to get the Father, the
Field-Mouse, to accompany and help him.

But all this time Kahr-naí-deh, the Badger, was not believing; and at
last he said to his wife:

"Now I will *see* if Old T'hoo-chée-deh is really a medicine-man. If he
finds me, I will believe him."

So from that day for four days the Badger touched no food, until he was
almost dead. And on the fifth day he said:

"*In-hlee-oo wáy-ee*, wife of me, go now and call T'hoo-chée-deh, to see
if he will cure me."

So the Badger-wife went with meal to the house of the Field-Mouse,
making to be very sad; and brought him back with her. When they came,
the Badger was as if very sick and in great pain.

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

T'hoo-chée-deh asked nothing; but took off the little pouch of roots and
laid it beside him. And then rubbing a little wood-ashes on his hands,
he put them on the stomach and breast of the Badger, rubbing and
feeling. When he had felt the Badger's stomach, he began to sing:

*Káhr-nah-hlóo-hlee wee-end-t'hú  
Beh-hú hoo-báhn,  
Ah-náh káh-chah-him-aí  
T'hóo-chee-hlóo-hlee t'oh-ah-yin-áhb  
Wee-end-t'hú beh-hú hoo-báhn*.

(Badger-Old-Man four days  
Has the hunger-killing,  
To know, to know surely  
If Field- Mouse-Old-Man  
Has the Medicine Power.  
Four days, four days,  
He has the hunger-killing.)

\[paragraph continues\] When he had finished rubbing and singing, he
said to the Badger:

"There is no need of a remedy. In my teaching I found you attentive--now
be true. You have wasted, in trying my power. Now get up and eat, to
make up for the lost. And do not think that way again."

With that, he took his pouch of roots and went home. As soon as he was
out of the house, the Badger said to his wife:

"My wife, now I believe that Mouse-Old-Man *has* the Power; and never
again will I think *that* way."

Then the Badger-wife brought food, and he ate--for he was dying of
hunger. When he had eaten, the animals came in to see him, for they had
heard that he was very sick. He told them all

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

that had been, and how T'hoo-chée-deh had known his trick. At that, all
the animals were afraid of the Field-Mouse, and respected him more than
ever--for it was plain that he indeed had the Power.

Time passing so, it came that one day the Men of the Old made
*nah-kú-ah-shu*, the great round-hunt. When they had made a great circle
on the *llano*, and killed many rabbits, some of them found
T'hoo-chée-deh, and made him prisoner. They brought him before the
*principales*, who questioned him, saying:

"How do you gain your life?"

"I gain it," he answered, "by going about among the animals who are
sick, and curing them.'"

Then the elders said: "If that is so, teach us your Power, and we will
set you free; but if not, you shall die."

T'hoo-chée-deh agreed, and they brought him to town with honor. For
twelve days and twelve nights he and the men stayed shut up in the
*estufa*; for two days fasting, and one day making the medicine-dance,
and then fasting and then dancing again, as our medicine-men do to this
day.

On the last night, when he had taught the men all the herbs and how to
use them, and they had become wise with practice, they sent
T'hoo-chée-deh out with a strong guard, that nothing should harm him.
They set him down at the door of his own house under the chapparo. A law
was made, giving him full liberty of all that is grown in the fields. To
this day, all True Believers honor him, so that he is not called small
any more. When they sing of him in the sacred places, they make

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

his house great, calling it *koor-óo-hlee naht-hóo*, the Mountain of the
Chapparo. And him they call not T'hoo-chée-deh, the Field-Mouse, but
*Pee-íd-deh p'ah-hláh-queer*, the Deer-by-the-River, that he may not
seem of little honor. <span id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_112.md) For he was
the Father of Medicine, and taught us how to cure the sick.

 

"*Tahb-kóon-ahm*?" cried the boys. "Is *that* why the Coyote always
cries? And is that why we must never hurt the Field-Mouse, but show him
respect, as to elders?"

"That is the very why," said Manuelito's grandfather, gravely; and all
the old men nodded.

"And why-----?" began 'Tonio. But his father shook his head.

"*Tah*! It is enough. *Tóo-kwai*!"

So we stepped out into the night to our homes. And from the *Kú-mai*,
black against the starry sky, the howl of Too-wháy-deh, wandering with
his toothache, swelled across the sleeping village of the Tée-wahn.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_108"></span>[232:1](pifs35.htm#fr_109.md) Pronounced
Mahn-way-lée-to.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[233:1](pifs35.htm#fr_110.md) A fixed belief among
the Pueblos, who will tell none of their myths between the Spring
Medicine-Making, in March, and the Fall Medicine- Making, in October,
lest the rattlesnake punish them for some slip from the truth.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[235:1](pifs35.htm#fr_111.md) This cure is still
practised among the Tée-wahn. The sovereign remedy for toothache,
however, is to go to the *estufa* after dark, carrying food in the left
hand, march round inside the big circular room three times, leave the
food under the secret recess in the wall where the scalps taken in old
wars are kept, and then come out. The toothache is always left behind!

<span id="fn_111"></span>[236:1](pifs35.htm#fr_112.md) The necessary
accompaniment, among the Pueblos, of a call for the doctor. In some
cases, the sacred smoking-herb was used. Either article was wrapped in
corn-husk. See, also, "Some Strange Corners of Our Country," chapters
xviii and xx.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[239:1](pifs35.htm#fr_113.md) This is not an
exception. Nearly all the animals known to the Tée-wahn have not only
their common name, but a ceremonial and sacred one, which is used
exclusively in the songs and rites.
