### THE MAKER OF THE THUNDER-KNIVES

YOU have perhaps seen the beautiful arrowheads of moss-agate, petrified
wood, or volcanic glass which were used, until very recently, by the
Indians of the Southwest, and are still treasured by them. At least you
are familiar with the commoner flint ones left by the aboriginal tribes
farther eastward. And seeing them, you must have wondered how they were
ever made from such fearfully stubborn stone-always the very hardest
that was accessible to the maker. I have tried for six hours, with the
finest drills, to make a little hole in the thinnest part of an agate
arrowhead, to put it on a charm-ring; but when the drill and I were
completely worn out, there was not so much as a mark on the arrow-head
to show what we had been doing. If you will take one to your jeweler, he
will have as poor luck.

But the making of the arrow-heads is really a very simple matter; and I
have fashioned many very fair ones. The only implements are part of a
peculiarly shaped bone--preferably from the thigh of the elk--and a
stick about the size of a lead-pencil, but of double the diameter. The
maker

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

of *puntas* takes the bone in his left hand; in his right is the stick,
against which the selected splinter of stone is firmly pressed by the
thumb. With a firm, steady pressure against the sharp edge of the bone,
a tiny flake is nicked from the splinter. Then the splinter is turned,
and a nick is similarly made on the other side, just a little ahead of
the first; and so on. It is by this alternate nicking from opposite
sides that the stone-splinter grows less by tiny flakes, and is shaped
by degrees to a perfect arrow-head. If you will notice the edge of an
arrow-head, you will see plainly that the work was done in this way, for
the edge is not a straight but a wavy line--sometimes even a zigzag,
recalling the manner in which saw-teeth are "set."

Every Indian, and every one who has studied the Indian, knows this. But
if I ask one of my brown old *compadres* here, where he got the
arrow-head which he wears as a charm about his wrinkled neck, he will
not tell me any such story as that. No, indeed!

Quáh-le-kee-raí-deh, the Horned Toad, gave it to him. So? Oh, yes! He
talked so nicely to a Horned Toad on the mesa <span
id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md) the other day, that the little creature
put a *punta* where he could find it the next time he went thither.

Whenever a Pueblo sees a Quáh-le-kee-raí-deh, he jumps from his horse or
his big farm-wagon, and makes every effort to capture the *animalito*
before it can reach a hole. If successful, he pulls from his blanket or
his legging-garters a red thread--no other color will do--and ties it
necklace--fashion

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

around the neck of his little prisoner. Then he invokes all sorts of
blessings on the Horned Toad, assures it of his sincere respect and
friendship, begs it to remember him with a *punta*, and lets it go. Next
time he goes to the mesa, he fully expects to find an arrow-head, and
generally does find one--doubtless because he then searches more
carefully on that broad reach where so many arrow-heads have been lost
in ancient wars and hunts. Finding one, he prays to the Sun-Father and
the Moon-Mother and all his other deities, and returns profound thanks
to the Horned Toad. Some finders put the arrow-head in the pouch which
serves Indians for a pocket. <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md) Some
wear it as an amulet on the necklace. In either case, the belief is that
no evil spirit can approach the wearer while he has that charm about
him. In fact, it is a sovereign spell against witches.

The common belief of the Pueblos is that the Horned Toad makes these
arrow-heads only during a storm, and deposits them at the very instant
when it thunders. For this reason an arrow-head is always called
*Kóh-un-shée-eh*, or thunder-knife. The strange appearance of this
quaint, spiked lizard--which is really not a "hop-toad" at all-doubtless
suggested the notion; for his whole back is covered with peculiar points
which have very much the shape and color of Indian arrow-heads.

Quáh-le-kee-raí-deh is a very important personage in the Pueblo
folk-lore. He not only is the inventor and patentee of the arrow-head
and the

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

scalping-knife, <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md) but he also invented
irrigation, and taught it to man; and is a general benefactor of our
race.

There is one very sacred folk-story which tells why boys must never
smoke until they have proved their manhood. Pueblo etiquette is very
strict on all such points. <span id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_42.md)

Once upon a time there lived in Isleta two boys who were cousins. One
day their grandfather, who was a True Believer (in all the ancient
rites), caught them in a corner smoking the *weer*. Greatly shocked, he
said to them:

"Sons, I see you want to be men; but you must prove yourselves before
you are thought to be. Know, then, that nobody is born with the freedom
of the smoke, but every one must earn it. So go now, each of you, and
bring me Quée-hla-kú-ee, the skin of the oak."

Now, in the talk of men, Quée-hla-kú-ee is another thing; but the boys
did not know. They got their mothers to give them some tortillas, <span
id="fr_43"></span>[3](#fn_43.md) and with this lunch they started for the
Bosque (a 10,000-foot peak twenty miles east of Isleta). Reaching the
mountain, they went to every kind of tree and cut a little piece of its
bark--for they were not sure which was the oak. Then they came home,
very tired, and carried the bark to their grandfather. But when he had
looked at it all he said:

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

"Young men, you have not yet proved yourselves. So now it is for you to
go again and look for the *oak*-bark."

At this their hearts were heavy, but they took tortillas and started
again. On the way they met an old Horned Toad, who stopped them and
said:

"Young-men-friends, I know what trouble you are in. Your *tata* has sent
you for the skin of the oak, but you do not know the oak he means. But I
will be the one to help you. Take these," and he gave them two large
thunder-knives," and with these in hand go up that cañon yonder. In a
little way you will see a great many of your enemies, the Navajos,
camping. On the first hill from which you see their fire, there stop. In
time, while you wait there, you will hear a Coyote howling across the
cañon. Then is the time to give your enemy-yell \[war-whoop\] and attack
them."

The boys thanked the Horned Toad and went. Presently they saw the
camp-fire of the Navajos, and waiting till the Coyote called they gave
the enemy-yell and then attacked. They had no weapons except their
thunder-knives, but with these they killed several Navajos, and the
others ran away. In the dark and their hurry they made a mistake and
scalped a woman (which was never customary with the Pueblos).

Taking their scalps, they hurried home to their grandfather, and when he
saw that they had brought the real oak-skin (which is an Indian euphemy
for "scalp"), he led them proudly to the Cacique, and the Cacique
ordered the T'u-a-fú-ar (scalp-dance). After the inside days, when the

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

takers of scalps must stay in the *estufa*, was the dance. And when it
came to the round dance at night the two boys were dancing side by side.

Then a young woman who was a [stranger](errata.htm#0.md) came and pushed
them apart and danced between them. She was very handsome, and both fell
in love with her. But as soon as their hearts thought of love, a
skeleton was between them in place of the girl--for they who go to war
or take a scalp have no right to think of love.

They were very frightened, but kept dancing until they were too tired,
and then went to the singers inside the circle to escape. But the
skeleton followed them and stood beside them, and they could not hide
from it.

At last they began to run away, and went to the east. Many moons they
kept running, but the skeleton was always at their heels. At last they
came to the Sunrise Lake, wherein dwell the Trues of the East.

The guards let them in, and they told the Trues all that had happened,
and the skeleton stood beside them. The Trues said: "Young men, if you
are men, sit down and we will protect you."

But when the boys looked again at the skeleton they could not stop, but
ran away again. Many moons they ran north till they came to where the
Trues of the North dwell in the Black Lake of Tears.

The Trues of the North promised to defend them, but again the skeleton
came and scared them away; and they ran for many moons until they came
to the Trues of the West, who dwell

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

in T'hoor-kím-p'ah-whée-ay, the Yellow Lake Where the Sun Sets. And
there the same things happened; and they ran away again to the south,
till they found the Trues of the South in P'ah-chéer-p'ah-whée-ay, the
Lake of Smooth Pebbles.

But there again it was the same, and again they ran many moons till they
came to the Trues of the Center, who live here in Isleta. And here the
skeleton said to them:

"Why do you run from me now? For when you were dancing you looked at me
and loved me, but now you run away."

But they could not answer her, and ran into the room of the Trues of the
Center, and told their story. Then the Trues gave power to the
Cum-pa-huit-la-wid-deh <span id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md) to see the
skeleton,-which no one else in the world could see, except the Trues and
the two young men, and said to him:

"Shoot this person who follows these two."

So the Cum-pa-huit-la-wid-deh shot the skeleton through with an arrow
from the left side to the right side, <span
id="fr_45"></span>[2](#fn_45.md) and took the scalp.

That was the end of the skeleton, and the young men were free. And when
the Trues had given them counsel, they came to their people, and told
the Cacique all. He made a new scalp-dance, because they had not stayed
to finish the first one.

And when the dance was done, they told all the people what had happened.
Then the principals had a meeting and made a rule which is to this

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

day, that in the twelve days of the scalp <span
id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md) no warrior shall think thoughts of love.

For it was because they had love-thoughts of the Navajo girl that her
skeleton haunted them. And at the same time it was made the law, which
still is, that no one shall smoke till he has taken a scalp to prove
himself a man.

For if the boys had not been smoking when they had not freedom to, their
grandfather would not have sent them, and all that trouble would not
have come. And that is why.
