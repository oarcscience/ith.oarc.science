### Coyote and the Friendly Dogs

A COYOTE who was very hungry was walking about the outskirts of a field.
He was discovered by a few dogs who were taking care of the crops. With
the dogs were some little quail. This was in the time when animals
talked like people and all of them understood one another.

The dogs talked to the coyote in such a way as not to frighten him,
saying, "Brother, come along with us. It looks as if you are quite
hungry."

"Poor little coyote," said the quail, with voices which showed their
pity. "It is obvious that you are very hungry."

The coyote, thinking that they were going to give him something to eat,
went with them. He walked along surrounded with dogs, for there were
many dogs, and the quail followed behind him singing:

*’ama mele wo'i  
wo'i taka ’ama mel*e.

\[paragraph continues\] Thus the little quail sang to the coyote. But he
did not like it, this song.

"Why do you sing this *’ama mele wo'i*?" the coyote asked,

"Oh, don't worry about that," said the dogs, "that is just a song." But
the words of the song meant, "For the last time you are a coyote." This
they sang because they were taking him off to kill him.

Before they arrived at the houses the dogs set up a great noise and
barking. Men came out of the houses, but the coyote couldn't run because
he was surrounded by dogs. The men took him off to where they lit a
great fire, and into it they threw the poor coyote. Here ends the story.
