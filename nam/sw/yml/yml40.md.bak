### Maisoka and Hima'awikia

MAISOKA was in his house one day and about the time that he stuck his
head out of his door, Hima'awikia was walking about. Maisoka said, "Who
walks on top of the house of the King?" He said this because he
considered himself a king.

Maisoka means tarantula. It is an animal which is black and has a number
of legs and a bit of hair. He lives in the ground, making a house in the
ground, as do the snakes. He puts a top on his hole, which is the door
to his house.

Hima'awikia is an insect with wings. It is a little animal, a bit
reddish and it flys. This is he who walked over the home of Maisoka
making a noise with his wings, going thus: "rururu."

Maisoka heard the "ronronron" and he stuck his head out and said, "Who
is this imposter who walks on the roof of the house of the King?"

"Oh, pardon me, Sir," said Hima'awikia, and Maisoka allowed him to enter
his house.

A few minutes later Hima'awikia came out carrying Maisoka between his
teeth. It appears unbelievable that Hima'awikia, who is so small, always
conquers Maisoka and eats him. Maisoka never escapes from the teeth of
Hima'awikia.
