### The Cricket and the Lion

EARLY one morning a young lion was out taking a walk through the fresh
monte when suddenly he came upon a large plain and a big lagoon full of
fresh, crystal water. After looking for a while, he went on his way. He
stopped and grubbed in a little hill of dry trash, and out of it jumped
a cricket. The lion wanted to crush him with his heavy hand, but the
lively cricket jumped from one side to the other and sang thus:
"chik chik chik."

The lion said to him, "Who are you?"

"I am the chief of a tribe more valiant than you or your tribe, answered
the cricket. And he kept on singing "chik chik chik."

The lion replied, "You want to make fun of me, but you are mistaken. I
am the king of the forest, of all of the big and the brave animals. They
are good soldiers, and strong."

"My soldiers are not very big in stature, but in valor, they are
immense, braver than all the tigers, wolves, and lions!" said the
cricket.

"I am displeased," said the lion. "Today I declare war on you."

"My troops are ready," said the cricket, "chik chik chik chik."

"Here, close to this lagoon, we will meet tomorrow," said the lion,
shaking his head.

It was winter-time. The lion went into the forest and gathered together
the animals of the claw, lions, tigers, wolves, coyotes, and many other
felines.

The cricket went to some bee-hives. To the bees he said, "Go and advise
all of your companions of the wing that we will fight the people of the
claw." So the bees called up all the insects that fly and sting, and
also the scorpions and ants. All met on the plain where the battle was
to take place so that all the ground was covered with them. The insects
hid among the stalks and among the branches. There, they awaited the
day.

Early in the morning, the cricket and the lion met. The cricket was
accompanied by four cockroaches and six Granddaddy-long-leg spiders. The
lion was accompanied by four coyotes, seven wolves, and many other
animals of the claw.

"Where are your soldiers?" asked the lion of the cricket.

"Don't ask me any questions. Let us battle!" said the cricket.

"Come on, boys!" shouted the lion. And all of the animals entered upon
the plain.

The ants and scorpions broke up out of the earth and commenced to bite
the paws of the soldiers of the lion. Wherever one might look came the
tiny animals with their tails pointed. The bees and hornets came in like
a cloud, and they began to bite the mouths, tails, and eyes of the
enemy. The cats found no way to defend themselves and howled with pain
and leapt high in the air. And the insects attacked more violently,
covering the entire bodies of the animals, climbing over them and biting
them many times. The big animals cried from pain and fear. Desperately
they ran and threw themselves into the water.

The insects retired to the branches, and the lion ordered the coyote to
go out and scout to see if those little birds of the devil were still
somewhere about.

The coyote walked out a little way and shouted, "Do you give in?" Then
to the lion he said, "They are finished." He had no sooner said this
than a troop of hornets descended on him. He ran and fell again into the
lagoon.

The animals stayed in the water all day until night arrived. At last
they came out, the lions, tigers, bears, and wolves, all the people of
the claw. They stepped very softly and quickly, going to the forest with
no desires ever again to battle with the insects.

Yaquis say that there is no small enemy. Everyone can defend himself.
The cricket continues to sing, "chik chik chik." He is not afraid.
