### Grasshopper and Cricket

THE CRICKET invited the grasshopper, saying, "Let's go over to that
banquet. We will see lots of wine. I'll get you some wine to drink and
then we can ride horseback all night long through the monte singing."

"Well, let's go," said the grasshopper, and they went to the banquet.

The cricket said to the grasshopper, "Sit down here on this little
stick. I am going to get you some wine." The cricket went over to where
they were serving wine and jumped into a cup of it. The Chief saw the
cricket in the cup and threw the wine over toward the grasshopper. He
bathed the grasshopper in wine.

"Good, isn't it?" asked the cricket.

"Delicious," answered the grasshopper.

Together they went away. They encountered a lion who was lying down.
They climbed up on top of him, singing. The lion, who was angry at being
disturbed, got up and walked away, trying to get away from the sound of
the singing. But the cricket and the grasshopper climbed out on the end
of the lion's tail and sang all night long as the lion walked about.

Finally the lion got tired of the singing and switched his tail and
threw off the grasshopper and the cricket and he went away into the
monte to lie down for a rest.

The old Yaquis say that now the lion keeps his distance from the
grasshopper and the cricket. He hides in places where there is no
*chik chik chik* to disturb his sleep.
