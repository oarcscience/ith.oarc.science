# YAQUI MYTHS AND LEGENDS

## By Ruth Warner Giddings

### \[1959, Copyright not registered or renewed\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a delightful collection of Yaqui folklore, illustrated with line
drawings which invest Mexican folk-art motifs with quaint atomic-age
cheerfulness. The Yaqui are part of the Southwestern Native American
culture-group, and live in the Sonoran desert on the west coast of
northern Mexico, opposite Baja California. The stories here are a
mixture of ancient folklore blended with Mexican Catholic themes. Coyote
and other zoomorphs walk in the same cycle of tales with figures such as
Jesuschristo (who figures in several comic stories) and Columbus (who
appears briefly as a villan).
