# VI. TRUE STORIES

### HOW THE PEOPLE CAME UP FROM FRIJOLES <span id="fr_199"></span>[1](#fn_198.md)

The people came up from Shipap. They lived all together at the mesa of
the Stone Lions: the people of Cochiti, of Santo Domingo, of San Felipe,
Acoma, and Laguna, and the people of Sia. They all spoke the same
language, and they lived as brothers. At last they had trouble. The
headman of one people took his families in one direction, and another in
another. The descendants of one mother went together with one headman.

The people of Santo Domingo followed down the east bank of the Rio
Grande till they came to Cactus Village (five miles from Cochiti). The
people of Cochiti went to the old pueblo of San Miguel (seven or eight
miles north of Cochiti on the west bank of the Rio Grande) having
followed down the Kapolin Canyon from the mesa of the Stone Lions. The
people of San Felipe, and Laguna, and Acoma followed down the Peralta
Canyon toward the west and built the (ruined) pueblo of Peralta Canyon
(six miles from Cochiti). There were people of the Corn clan among them,
and they were not willing to go with their brothers to the south, and
they went off by themselves and lived with the Utes and the Apaches.

The people of Cochiti lived at San Miguel. At last they had trouble.
They came to the Potrero Plateau (Plateau of the Buildings, nearer
Cochiti). There they lived many years. They made war on the different
pueblos, and they all tried to drive the people of Cochiti from their
plateau. While they were fighting, the Spaniards came from the south.
The rest of the pueblos leagued with the Spaniards against the people of
Cochiti. All these pueblos had already come down off their mesas and had
been given lands by the Spaniards. Only the people of Cochiti were still
on their mesa. There was only one trail up to the pueblo, and at the top
the people had piled boulders. When any enemy came up the trail, they
rolled down a boulder and killed him. The Spaniards could not bring the
people down from their mesa. They went to Santa Clara and to Tesuque and
the far-off pueblos to get help against the people (of Cochiti). They
could do nothing against them. There were a thousand warriors among the
people (of Cochiti) then; it was the largest of the pueblos. No one
could hurt them on their mesa. Many of the people

of Santa Domingo, San Felipe, Taos, San Juan, Santa Clara, Nambe, and
even the people of Picuris, and Apicu (said to be a Mexican town) were
killed in great numbers. They fled, and the people (of Cochiti) chased
them, piling great heaps of stones along their way, one stone for each
enemy they had killed. These piles of stones still remain all the way to
the river. When the people had chased them across the river they
returned to their mesa.

The Spaniards came against them again from the south, with all the
pueblos. They laid siege to the mesa. The people went up and down a
secret trail to the north side for their water. There was no path; they
knew the way down the face of the mesa where there was nothing but
rocks. The Spaniards thought of a plan. They captured a (Cochiti) Indian
who had been living a long time in Jemez. They made preparations to kill
him, but just as they were about to put him to death, they told him that
if he would show them the trail the people used going up and down for
water on the north side of the mesa, they would set him free. He
promised he would take them up the trail.

That night he waited at the Moon Trail (secret trail) and took the
Spaniards and the men of the southern pueblos up the face of the cliff.
There was no path; they climbed from rock to rock. In the morning the
people woke on the mesa, and they saw that the whole north side of the
mesa was filled with their enemies. They saw there was no hope of
resistance, for the Spanish had guns. They surrendered. The Spanish
brought them down off the mesa, the women came carrying their babies.
The Spanish put them across the river at Tipute to the east of the
present site of Cochiti. The river covered that site with floods when it
was high, and they asked the Spanish for a better place, on the west
side of the river. The Spanish gave it to them. They came to the west
side and built there, but the western edge of the old village is now the
eastern edge of the present pueblo (at the church). In Santo Domingo
also they built at first so that the eastern edge of the old village is
now the, western edge of the present pueblo. From that time the people
lived as they do now.
