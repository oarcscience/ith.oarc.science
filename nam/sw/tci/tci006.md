### THE ORIGIN OF DEATH <span id="fr_12"></span>[11](#fn_12)

They were coming up from Shipap. One of their children became sick and
they did not know what was the trouble with him. They had never seen
sickness before. They said to the Shkoyo (curing society) chief,
"Perhaps our Mother in Shipap will help us. Go back and ask her to take
away this trouble." He went back to our Mother and she said to him, "The
child is dead. If your people did not die, the world would fill up and
there would be no place for you to live. When you die, you will come
back to Shipap to five with me. Keep on traveling and do not be troubled
when your people die."

He returned to his people and told them what our Mother had said. In
those days they treated one another as brothers, all the Indians of all
the pueblos. They planted corn with the digging stick and they were
never tired; they dug trenches to irrigate their fields. The corn
ripened in one day. When they came to Frijoles they separated, and the
different pueblos went their own ways.
