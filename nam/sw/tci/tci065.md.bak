### THE GIRL AND THE GRASSHOPPERS <span id="fr_132"></span>[10](#fn_131.md)

Payatamu was playing his pipe in his squash meadow. Yellow Woman had a
meadow of squashes also. She was watching her field when a grasshopper
came along singing. The girl thought it was a pretty song. "Will you
sing for me?" she asked. "I think it is a very pretty song." "What will
you pay?" "You can go into my squash meadow and eat all you want. If I
learn your song I can sing it to myself while I am watching my meadow."
So he sang for Yellow Woman and got permission to eat all he wanted. But
instead of eating just by himself, he called all the rest of the
grasshoppers

to eat what they wanted. They ate it all up. Yellow Woman began to cry
and said, "I didn't say to eat it all up. I only invited you to eat by
yourself. I told you to sing a song for me and in return I said you
could eat what you wanted." She went and told her father and mother that
the grasshopper had eaten up all her field. They came at once to see,
and the girl got a good whipping. They took all her clothes off and
drove her away.

She went off crying. She heard somebody playing a pipe. It was Payatamu.
When she, came closer she heard the song--

I have squash vines,  
Squashes! Look well at them.

When the girl came to the meadow she called, "Hello." He was on top of
his shelter and he called to her, "Why are you naked? Why do you go
around like that?" "It's because my father and mother drove me away. A
grasshopper came to my squash vines and sang a song. I thought it was
pretty and I told him to sing it again and I would pay him with my
squashes. They ate them all up. That is why they beat me." "Don't worry,
I'll dress you." Payatamu. gave a long stick to the girl and said, "Do
not feel sorry for me. With that stick, hit me as hard as you can." The
first time she did this, a manta came out, and when she did it again a
woman's belt. She did it a third time and there was a pair of moccasins,
and the fourth time a white manta for her back. She put on her
moccasins, next the manta, and then the woman's belt, and last she put
the white manta over her shoulders. She said, "All right, thank you. Now
everything shall be as you say. I'll go wherever you take me." Payatamu
took Yellow Woman home. When they got to his house they went up the
ladder. He called to his grandmother, "Here is Yellow Woman." "Bring her
in, bring her in. Where did you find her?" "I brought her from one of
the field shelters. When I was playing my pipes she came to my hut. She
was naked and I dressed her. She told me that she would go with me to my
house." The grandmother took her in gladly and they all lived together.
