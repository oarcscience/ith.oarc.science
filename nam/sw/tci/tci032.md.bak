### THE CONTEST OF POKER BOY'S WIVES <span id="fr_65"></span>[16](#fn_65.md)

The people were living at Old Pueblo. Poker Boy always went hunting. He
was an ugly, untidy boy, and his hair was bushy and singed. His wife was
Yellow Woman. Old Ku'iatse saw him coming back home with a deer on his
back. She began singing a song. She said, "He doesn't hear me." She sang
it again, and danced the same song. <span

Poker Boy, Poker Boy,  
O-O-O! (Exclamation of fear.)  
Poker Boy, Poker Boy,  
O-O-O!  
His hair is singed, but everybody loves him,  
Again he is coming with a deer on his back.

Poker Boy's wife lived in the upper story over the old woman, and she
heard the old woman singing. She said to herself, "Maybe he is coming."
She went to meet him. She took his bow and arrows, and they went into
the house together. They carried up the deer and brought it into the
house. She began to make a feast for them all for the next morning. She
got up early and made the food ready. Then she called all the people in
the village to eat the feast that she had made. She said to Poker Boy,
"Go and get that old woman who was dancing so that she may eat the eyes
of the deer." So the old woman came to the feast. When they had had the
feast they all came out of the house.

Yellow Woman's younger sister was Merinaku (Blue Woman). Blue Woman was
jealous of her sister, and she wanted to take her husband away from her.
She said, "We will have a contest for Poker Boy." An old woman came in
and said to her, "Just wait a while, and I shall tell you something. I
will take this boy to my house." So Poker Boy went with the old woman.
The two girls

stayed behind in Poker Boy's house. She told them to grind corn and to
bring the finest meal that they could grind to her house where Poker Boy
was. They did this, and she took the flour. She put a polished
floor-rubbing stone against the wall. She said, "Throw your meal against
this stone. <span id="fr_67"></span>[14](#fn_66.md) Whoever throws meal
that sticks to the stone gets Poker Boy." Yellow Woman threw first. Her
meal fell. Blue Woman threw next. Her meal fell. Yellow Woman threw
again, and once more the flour would not stick. Blue Woman threw again,
and her flour, too, would not stick. Four times they each threw the
meal, and each time it fell. Neither of them could win Poker Boy. The
old woman told them to parch white corn first, and then grind it fine.
They took white corn, parched it and ground it. Again they brought it to
the woman's house. She set the shiny floor-rubbing stone against the
wall and told them each to throw her flour against it, and the one whose
meal stuck should have Poker Boy for her husband. Yellow Woman threw
first and her meal stuck. So she got her husband back again.

He went to hunt again. When he was coming home Ku'iatse was singing
again. She sang--

Poker Boy, Poker Boy,  
O-O-O!  
Poker Boy, Poker Boy,  
O-O-O!  
His hair is singed but everybody loves him,  
Again he is coming with a deer on his back.

He was carrying the deer on his back. He took it to his house.
