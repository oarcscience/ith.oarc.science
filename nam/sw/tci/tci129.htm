<P>Long ago.--che'.--There somewhere in the northwest corner dwelt somewhere Ganadyani in a cave. There dwelt Ganadyani the chief. Then his wife gave birth. He had a child, a boy. They lived inside together. Then Ganadyani spoke thus, "I am going to plant," said he. He told his wife. Then his wife, spoke thus, "What are you going to plant?" said she to him. She told her husband. Then Ganadyani spoke thus, "Well, deer, and elk, and mountain sheep, and antelope, and buffalo, and jack rabbits, and rabbits, and gophers (?). All kinds of game I am going to plant," said he. Then Ganadyani, the chief, planted. Now they came up. Then his child went there. He spoke thus. "Oh my!" said his child, "what has father planted?" said he. "I am going to see," said his child. Then the boy went there. He took a rabbit stick. Then he arrived at the place where his own father had planted all kinds of game. Then the boy hit them with his rabbit stick, the, deer that was just coming out and everything that he had planted. Then the others, Oh my! the poor ones. He tore off all their ears, the child of Ganadyani, the boy. Then his father went there. There was his child. Ganadyani, the chief, spoke thus, "My child," Said he, "evidently you did some mischief," said Ganadyani, "to the poor game that I planted," said Ganadyani, thus he said to his child. Then his child spoke thus, "What kind of thing did you plant, father?" said he. "I wanted to see it, therefore I am here," said his child. Then his father, Ganadyani, the chief, spoke thus, "Well, my child, I planted all kinds of game," said he, "and now the poor ones, you tore off all their ears," said he to his child. "So that is what you planted," said his child. "I did not know that at all," said the child, "therefore I hit them," said he, "with my rabbit stick," said he. Then Ganadyani spoke thus, "Now the poor ones are coming up, don't bother them any more," said he to his child. "When they grow up you will see them," said he to his child. Then the two went away from there, both he and his child. Then the two entered their house. His mother was inside. Then Ganadyani, the chief, spoke thus. He said to his mother, "There somewhere the poor child did some mischief," said he. "There somewhere my child with his rabbit stick tore off the ears of some of the poor ones. The poor ones, behold, now the game that I planted is coming up," said Ganadyani, the chief. Then he told his wife, "Do not let my child hurt mine any more," said he. "'When they all come up then you will see them,' said I to my child." Then the mother scolded her child. "Oh, my child, why did you do that to them?" said to him his mother. "Your poor father has planted game," said his mother. She scolded</P>

<P>him. "Somewhere you tore off the ears of some of the poor ones," said she to him. "Now do not hit the poor ones any more, my child," said she to him. "When they all come up, then we shall go to see them together," said his mother, "when Ganadyani, the chief, has planted all the game," said his mother. "Then for four days, we together shall purify ourselves by vomiting," said Ganadyani, the chief. Now for four days they purified themselves by vomiting. Then Ganadyani spoke thus, "Tomorrow we will go and see whether all the game has come up," said he. Then early he went to look. Now four days had passed. Then he went down there to some place and arrived where he had planted. Now all the game had come out. Already some of the game was walking about, everything, just what he had planted. Then he went to his house from there and he went to tell his wife and his child, Then he spoke thus, "Somewhere now all the game is come up," thus he said. "Let us now together go down and his mother shall take sacred meal and pollen," said Ganadyani the, chief. Then he took his wife. Then the two went together, Ganadyani and his wife, Yellow Woman. They went there together. There was much game there. They arrived. Then Ganadyani called the game.. Every animal from around there came. (The ground) just shook on account of the game of every kind, turkeys, eagles, deer, elk, mountain sheep, antelope, rabbits, jack rabbits, gophers, coyotes, every kind of game, bears, mountain lions, lynx, wolves, every kind that he had planted had come up. Then his wife went there and his child went together with her. Then Ganadyani, the chief, called them, he who had very supernatural power. Then they gave sacred meal and pollen to the game. "Eat, game, take all together the food," said Yellow Woman. "Now all the game of poor Ganadyani has come up," said his wife. "Thanks, it is nice, now we are going to eat game below here," said Yellow Woman, the wife of Ganadyani, and his child, Payatamu.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_230"></A><A HREF="#fn_228"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Then Ganadyani spoke thus, "Now these are my children," said he to them. Ganadyani had all the. game as his children. Then he spoke thus, "Now you all will go from here," said he. Then the game was scattered from there. Therefore there are all kinds of game in the mountains. Then, "Eagles, you will be above, you will go there," said he. Then he scattered the game all about. Therefore all kinds of game lives in the mountains. Then, "Eagles, you will live above," said Ganadyani. "From above you will give life," the eagles were told. Therefore the eagles live above. Ganadyani sent the eagles there. "But all kinds of game, you will live in the mountains," said to them Ganadyani. Then he told his wife, Yellow Woman, "And thus," said he, "I have now scattered all the game,"</P>

<P>said Ganadyani. "Now, you, game, will live on the mountains," said he. "Thus here when anyone kills a deer or bear or, mountain lion or wolf or lynx or badger or rabbit or any kind of game, be, it mountain lion, mountain sheep or elk or antelope or eagle or turkey or coyote, if anyone kills any kind of game, we shall be eating, if anyone is lucky and catches it," said Ganadyani. "Only you, my child, Payatamu, you will always hunt with bow and arrow," said to him his father, "and with club and rabbit stick you will hunt them," said Ganadyani, the chief. "From here I have scattered all the game," said Ganadyani, the chief. "All the, game are my children," said he. "I planted the game," said he, "therefore all the game animals are my children," said Ganadyani. "You, Yellow Woman," said he to his wife, "if my child, Payatamu, hunts deer and if he kills one, then you will grind blue corn below here on the grinding place and you will grind blue corn. Then you will put the meal in the basket. You will make wafer-bread for him. Our child, Payatamu, will hunt deer," said Ganadyani, the chief. "Then you, his mother, when you grind corn, you will only make wafer-bread," said to her Ganadyani, the chief. "And you will stir mush. Mush and wafer-bread and atole will be our food," said Ganadyani, "and any kind of game, if anyone kills it, will be our food. All our poor people here, if from a poor town any Payatamu goes hunting, then they will give Yellow Women to the youth who hunts game," said Ganadyani, the chief. "Then Yellow Woman, you will only make wafer-bread and mush and atole, and, Yellow Woman, you will only grind blue corn and yellow and red and white corn, and that, Yellow Woman, you will allow to the Payatamu," that told them Ganadyani, the chief. Then he spoke thus, "Payatamu, you will hunt only with bow and arrow and club and rabbit stick all kinds of game here, Payatamu," said Ganadyani, the chief. Then he said, "If anyone is lucky and he should kill a deer or any kind of game, the Yellow Woman will eat it," said Ganadyani, the chief. "All kinds of game are my children. I shall be the one to give it," said Ganadyani, the chief. "I allow to him the game if anyone wishes to go hunting," said he. "I allow all of it," said Ganadyani, the chief. Then Ganadyani spoke thus, "Now," he said, "I shall go to my house," said he, "and somewhere in the northwest corner there is my house," said he. "Now I place all the game on the mountains," said he, "and the game will live," said Ganadyani, the chief. "Now, I shall go to my house," said he. Then he went away somewhere to the cave We'nima and he went forever. Then his wife, Yellow Woman, and his child, Payatamu, lived there together. He had one child, a boy. Then he was hunting deer and his mother made wafer-bread and all entered We'nimadze, Ganadyani, his wife, and his child.</P>
