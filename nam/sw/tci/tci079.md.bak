### COYOTE SINGS FOR THE PRAIRIE DOGS <span id="fr_159"></span>[1](#fn_158.md)

In the mountains Old Coyote Mother and Father were living. Old Man
Coyote had a little drum and he sat above the road and beat the drum and
sang,

Look out! Look out!  
Coyote is going to hit you  
On the back, on the back.

\[paragraph continues\] Lots of prairie dogs came running. They cried,
"Dear me, grandfather. How beautifully you sing! Sing it again and we'll
dance to it." Coyote began to beat his drum again and the prairie dogs
made a circle and stood out to dance. Coyote sang again,

Look out! Look out!  
Coyote is going to hit you  
On the back, on the back.

\[paragraph continues\] They stepped in time to the song. "Grandfather,
sing it again. It is such fun to dance to your song." They danced and
danced.

Grandmother Coyote called, "Come on, grandfather. Let me sing a while
for them." The prairie dogs said to Grandfather Coyote, "You sing so
nice, sing again." "No, your grandmother is in a hurry." "We know she is
calling you, but please sing some more. You sing such a beautiful song.
Sing it again and we can learn that song." <span
