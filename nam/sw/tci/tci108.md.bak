### HALF ROOSTER <span id="fr_198"></span>[2](#fn_197.md)

Long ago when the people of Cochiti came down from the mesa, there was a
half rooster with them. He came to a house where a woman lived. She gave
him food to eat. After he had gone on a little way Half Rooster came
back and said, "I have lost my spoon. I have come to look for it." For
Half Rooster had great supernatural power. The woman in the house said,
"There was no spoon left here." Half Rooster said, "If you don't return
it, I shall go southwest where the king lives and bring suit against
you." "All right, you may bring suit." Half Rooster went southwest to
the king. On the way he met a lion who said to him, "Rooster, where are
you going?" "I am going southwest to the king to tell him that they
stole my spoon." "I shall go too." "All right, come into my arse." "How
do I get in?" "Don't say that." So the lion went into Half Rooster's
arse.

When he had gone half of the way he met a bear who asked, "Where are you
going?" "I am going southwest to the king to tell him that they stole my
spoon." "I shall go too." "All right, come into my arse." "How do I do
that?" "Don't say that." So he went into Half Rooster's arse. When they
were almost there, he met a wolf who asked, "Where are you going?" "I am
going southwest to the king to tell him that they stole my spoon." "I
shall go too." "All right, come into my arse." "How do I go in?" "Don't
say that." So he went into Half Rooster's arse.

He started again and met a grinding stone. He said, "Where are you
going?" "I am going southwest to the king to tell him that they stole my
spoon." "I shall go too." "All right, come into my arse." "How do I go
in?" "Don't say that." So he went into Half Rooster's arse. He started
again and he, met fire. Fire said, "Where are you going?" "I am going
southwest to the king to tell him that they stole my spoon." "I shall go
too." "All right, come into my arse." "How do I get in?" "Don't say
that." So he went into Half Rooster's arse. Then he came to a pond.
Water asked, "Where are you going?" "I am going southwest to the king to
tell him they stole my spoon." "I shall go too." "All right,

come into my arse." "How do I go in?" "Don't say that." Water started to
go in, and at last all the pond went into Half Rooster's arse.

He went on, and as he was getting near, some soldiers saw him coming. He
came to where they were standing outside of the king's palace. He asked
for the king. They told him, "He is inside." "Call him out, for I came
to put it before the king that my spoon is stolen." The king came out;
he was frightened. "Heavens!" he said, "I never saw such a man as this!
Maybe he is a great devil. Put him in a big fire and burn him up. Catch
him, catch him! Or else take him to the barn where the wild horses are.
They will kick him to death." The soldiers caught him and brought him to
the barn. They shut him up there all night. When they had left him, he
said to Lion, "Great Lion, come out and kill these wild horses."

The next morning the king told the soldiers to go and get Rooster. "He
will be killed," he said. They went to the barn and opened the door and
all the horses and mules were lying dead and Rooster was sitting up
proudly. They ran to tell the king that Rooster was sitting up and that
all the horses and mules were dead. "A wonderful Rooster he is!" said
the king, "Or else he's a devil! Bring him out of the barn and shut him
up with the great bulls. They, will trample him." The soldiers took him
where the bulls were. They watched a while. When they had gone, Rooster
called out Bear, "Great Bear, come out and kill these bulls."

In the morning the king told the soldiers to get Rooster for he would be
killed. They came to the barn where the bulls were. Rooster was sitting
up proudly. They ran off to tell the king that all his bulls were dead.
The king said, "He is a great devil. Take him to the two dangerous mules
that nobody has ever touched. They will kill him." That night they shut
him up with the two dangerous mules. They watched him for a while. When
they went off, Rooster called Wolf, "Great Wolf, come out and kill these
two dangerous mules." He came out and struck them down. When the
soldiers came to the place where the two dangerous mules were they found
them dead and Rooster sitting up proudly. They ran to tell the king. He
told the soldiers to take Rooster to the church for it was winter. "He
will freeze," he said. They took him straight to the church and shut him
up. When night came he called to Grinding Stone, "Grinding Stone, come
out and break all the santus and pictures in this church." Grinding
Stone broke them and threw them into the middle of the floor. In the
morning the soldiers came to get him. They found him sitting up with all
the santus and pictures broken and piled in a circle around him.

When they told the king he said, "Put him in an icy place and press ice
on him." The soldiers took him to an icy place. They put him under the
ice and they pulled slabs of ice on top of him and pressed him down.
They told the king, "We did as you told us." "All right. He'll freeze
this time." That night when everything was quiet Half Rooster said to
Fire, "Great Fire, come out and melt all this ice." The Great Fire came
out and melted all the ice. He called Fire back to his arse again and it
went, and the ground dried up. Nobody could see how Rooster had melted
the ice. The king said, "Go and get Rooster. He'll be frozen to death."
They went and opened the door. There he was sitting up proudly. The
king, said, "Leave him where he is and go and get four wagons of wood."
They all went to get the wood. One was to get a great log. The king
said, "When you all get back, set the log upright and pile the four
wagons of wood around it. Tie Rooster to the log (stake) and set fire to
the wood, but wait until the morning to light it so that all the people
can see him burn."

They tied him to the log and started the fire. "He is sure to die. He is
sure to die," all the people said. Some people were sorry for him; some
wanted him to burn to death. As soon as the fire was burning hard, he
said, "Great Water, come out and pour over this fire and put it out."
Water came out of his arse and put out the fire. It covered the ground.
That is how he was saved. So the king said, "Take him down, for he must
have great power. I could not do anything to overcome him." So the king
took him to his house and he lived with him forever.
