### HOW THEY CAME DOWN FROM THE MESA <span id="fr_204"></span>[3](#fn_203.md)

Long ago the Cochiti Indians lived on the top of Cochiti Mesa. They had
to carry all their water to the top of the mesa, and when they fought
the Navaho, they had to come way down where Cochiti is now to have the
battle. The women had to bring the bowls of food for their dinner way
down to Kai'ati (up Bland Canyon) and then they had to return to the
mesa, and this was very dangerous. They saw that this was too hard work
for them, so they thought of moving down off the mesa.

They all came down. They stayed two days, but they were not used to it
so they went back to the mesa. Some said, "How can we make our living up
here? We had better stay where we were (Cochiti)." "All right." They
came down again. They said, "We will stay in the place where they put
us, for we had a hard

time coming so far to fight with the Navaho." The Navahos hid in the
rocky places before the battle and that is why it was so dangerous for
them. The medicine men prayed hard for their people, that they might get
used to it in this place (by the river), but still they went back again.

Again they made plans to come down again. They said that they were going
to put a priest here for them in this place; they had not had a priest
before, and that is why they were not contented to remain here. They
sent the priests so that they would stay here. All the people were
baptized. In a few days they were used to it here. They gave them a
santu, our lady of Guadelupe, but still they did not like it here; they
began to go back again to the mesa. They went into the church where the
santu was and they broke it to bits and chewed it. It was sweet and they
ate it all up. After they had done this they all ran back to the mesa.

They brought them back again and said, "Do not go back any more. You
know that you can not raise crops there." They came home (present site)
and they put a priest in charge to teach them how to be Catholic. But
still the people did not care about santus nor priests. They gave the
priest a girl to be his housekeeper. The girl had a room in the place
where the priest stayed. One night they had a meeting in the priest's
house and she did not sleep that night in the church, but in her own
house. The people said, "In the night we will go to the top of the house
where the priest sleeps and throw chili seeds down the chimney to choke
the father." They went to the roof and they threw seeds down the
chimney. The priest coughed, but did not know what was the matter. He
saw smoke coming out from the fireplace. He tried to get out, but the
door was locked. Right there he died. So they killed that priest. They
found him dead, but nobody knew who had done it.

They sent another priest in his place, but again the people came back to
the mesa, for that is where they were all born, and it was home to them.
They put another woman in charge of the new priest's cooking. He began
baptizing and they got used to living down here. The woman lived in his
house and the priest had intercourse with her. He began to take very
good care of her and bought her good shoes and food. He made her the
best dressed woman in the village. But before her child was born the
girl died. Afterwards she came back as a mule. (Now the saying is: "A
girl who has intercourse with a Mexican comes back as a rooster or a
hen.") The flesh on her legs was torn and swollen as if with hobbles
(from the punishment she had received in the other world before she was
reincarnated as a mule).
