<P>Their mother died, and left three children, a grown girl, a little girl, and a little boy. The elder sister did not like her younger brother and sister. She was not good to them.

The neighbor said to her, "Poor little girl! You have had trouble with your little brother. I guess your sister is a devil; she doesn't think anything about you." The sister never came home from Santo Domingo.</P>
