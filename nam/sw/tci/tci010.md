### COYOTE FAILS AS INITIATE <span id="fr_17"></span>[9](#fn_17.md)

In the beginning when animals were created and named, the carnivorous
animals and birds fasted for their prey. For four days they fasted from
food and drink. The third day Coyote got very hungry. He took sacred
meal and went into the outer room and threw it into the water and drank
it. That same day Wildcat said to Coyote, "You are getting thirsty."
"No; I am not. Sister, if you want to drink, take sacred meal and go
into the outer room and drink. That's what I did, and that's why I am
not thirsty." So Wildcat went into the outer room and took sacred meal
and put it in water and drank. She came back into the inner room.

On the fifth day those who had fasted were allotted the animals that
were to be their prey. Coyote and Wildcat were told that they could get
their living with hardship and great labor (because they had broken the
fast), but the others would never fail. So Mountain Lion was chief of
all the animals for he had completed all the observances of the fast.
