### THE GIANT AND THE GIRL <span id="fr_46"></span>[4](#fn_46.md)

"Where are you?" "Indeed! right here!" said Yellow Woman. Then the giant
spoke thus, "Where?" Then Yellow Woman spoke thus, "Indeed! right here!"
said Yellow Woman. The giant arrived where Yellow Woman was. Then the
giant said thus to her, "Give me your shoes!" said he to her. She gave
him her shoes and the giant ate her shoes. Then the giant also said thus
to her, "Give me this your dress!" She gave him the dress and the giant
ate it. Then again he said thus to her, "Give me your belt!" Then she
also gave him the belt and the giant ate it. He also said thus to her.
"Now come out!" said he to her. "I shall eat you up," said he to her.
Then Yellow Woman cried. She shouted, "The giant wants to take me out!
He will eat me up!" Then the giant took his cane. He was going to take
out Yellow Woman with his cane. Then Yellow Woman was running about
inside. Yellow Woman shouted and cried.

Then Ma\*'s’ewa and O'yoyewa on the south top (of the Sandia Mountains)
heard her. "Listen!" said Ma\*'s’ewa, "somewhere someone is shouting.
Listen, someone is crying," said Ma\*'s’ewa. Then O'yoyewa spoke thus,
"It is Yellow Woman who is crying," said he. "Let us go!" said he. "Let
us two go where the poor one is crying," said Ma\*'s’ewa. Then they took
arrows, both Ma\*'s’ewa and O'yoyewa. They arrived there where Yellow
Woman was going

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

to be eaten by the giant. Then Ma\*'s’ewa and O'yoyewa arrived there.
They let go their arrows and Ma\*'s’ewa shot the giant in the heart.
Ma\*'s’ewa had killed the giant. He cut him open. Then he made for him a
turquoise heart. He resuscitated the giant. He sent the giant
southwestward. Then Ma\*'s’ewa spoke thus, "Poor Yellow Woman," said he
to her. "Was it you who was shouting here?" said he to Yellow Woman.
"Yes," said Yellow Woman. "Poor one," said Ma\*'s’ewa to her, "what is
the matter?" said Ma\*'s’ewa to her. "What are you doing here?" "Yes,"
said Yellow Woman, "I was hunting rabbits," said she. "My brother did
not go hunting," said she, "therefore I went hunting," said Yellow
Woman. "The people of the town went hunting rabbits, but my brother did
not go hunting. Therefore, I went hunting rabbits. Then here the night
overtook me," said Yellow Woman to him. "Then I went here into this
cave," said Yellow Woman. "There I made a fire," said she. "Then someone
came along shouting," said Yellow Woman. "I went outside. Then I heard,
'Where are you?' said it. Then Yellow Woman <span
id="fr_47"></span>[5](#fn_47.md) spoke thus, 'Indeed, right here!' said
Yellow Woman. Then the giant came and he arrived at the cave. Then I
went in. The giant said to me, 'Give me your shoes from the north,' said
the giant to me." Thus had said to her the giant. She told Ma\*'s’ewa
and O'yoyewa. She told the two. "Then 'Give me this your dress!' the
giant said to me. I gave him my dress. Then again the giant said to me,
'Give me this your belt!' said the giant to me. I gave him my belt. Then
the giant ate my whole dress and my shoes and my belt," said Yellow
Woman. She told Ma\*'s’ewa and O'yoyewa. "The giant was about to take me
out, and then I cried," said Yellow Woman. "I shouted," said Yellow
Woman. "Then he tried to take me out with his cane and from there I ran
about inside," said Yellow Woman. The giant said to me, 'Come out! I
shall eat you at once,' said the giant to me. Then I cried. Then
Ma\*'s’ewa heard it. The two arrived and killed the giant," said she to
Ma\*'s’ewa. Thus she told him. Then Ma\*'s’ewa spoke thus, "I heard it,"
said Ma\*'s’ewa, "and there I and O'yoyewa, we two came here," said
Ma\*'s’ewa. "We thought it was you who was crying here," said Ma\*'s’ewa
to her, "and therefore I killed the giant," said Ma\*'s’ewa. Then he
said to her thus, "Let us go!" said to her Ma\*'s’ewa. Then they took
Yellow Woman along. Ma\*'s’ewa and O'yoyewa, the two, went together
westward hunting rabbits. Then Ma\*'s’ewa killed a rabbit and Yellow
Woman took the rabbit. Then O'yoyewa killed a rabbit. Yellow Woman took
the rabbit. They came from the west, killing rabbits while travelling,
Ma\*'s’ewa and O'yoyewa. Afterward Yellow Woman

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

carried the rabbits on her back. Ma\*'s’ewa and O'yoyewa killed many.
Then they arrived here at the town. They took the girl to her house.
Then Ma\*'s’ewa said to her thus, "Now you may go," said he to Yellow
Woman. Thus they said. Then Yellow Woman said, "Thank you, Ma\*'s’ewa
and O'yoyewa." "Thank you," said the girl. "You killed enough rabbits
for me. Now I shall be eating rabbits. I have never eaten rabbits
before," said Yellow Woman. "Here in the town the people now go hunting
rabbits. My brother did not want to go hunting. Therefore I myself went
hunting. I was going to eat rabbits. Thank you, Ma\*'s’ewa and O'yoyewa.
You heard me and therefore you killed these many for me, Ma\*'s’ewa and
O'yoyewa." Then Ma\*'s’ewa and O'yoyewa went away to the south top.
Ma\*'s’ewa and O'yoyewa went out. "Thank you," said Yellow Woman. (Then
you will say, "That long is the bald tail.") <span
