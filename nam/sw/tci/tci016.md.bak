### THE RECOVERY OF THE KOSHARE <span id="fr_31"></span>[17a](#fn_31.md)

The people were coming up from Shipap. Masewa led them, and after him
his brother Oyoyewa. After them came our mother Iareku, the corn fetish.
They came up through the doorway of the rainbow and after Iareku all of
the Indians of the pueblos came together. Each of them carried an ear of
corn and when they came to a great rock where there was a hollow they
ground corn for themselves. Half of the people stayed at White House,
and half at the Village of the Two Lions.

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

At White House the kurena held a dance. When it was over the kurena went
back to their home in the east, but the koshare went to the middle of
the earth, to Cochiti. They did not go back again to White House and
nobody knew where they had gone. The next time they had a dance (in
White House) nobody was happy. The koshare were not there to play
between the dances. They were unhappy and went to Iareku. She said to
them, "Yes, the dance is not right without the koshare. People do not
enjoy it unless they are there. Go to the village of Cochiti and you
will find the koshare in the middle of this world."

The people started for the village of Cochiti. Masewa led them. As they
came close to Cochiti they could hear the clowning of the koshare. They
said, "What is that? Is that the koshare?" They went to the north side
where they could hear. The masked dancers were dancing in the plaza all
by themselves. The chief men of White House went in and the koshare met
them. They brought them into the middle of the village where the dance
was going on. The koshare were clowning and everybody was happy. When
the dance was over, the people and the katcinas and the koshare all went
into the room of the Flint Society and they assigned colors to each of
the koshare. <span id="fr_32"></span>[18](tci017.htm#fn_33.md) They gave
them a color for each direction and that was the time when the koshare
got their colors.
