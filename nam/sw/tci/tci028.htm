<P>Here in the town somewhere dwelled Arrow Youth and his wife Yellow Woman. Then Arrow Youth went hunting rabbits thither westward. Then he always went hunting rabbits. Then an eagle (girl) came there. She came to get Arrow Youth, there from the zenith above the eagle came to get him. Then she reached the ground. The eagle spoke thus, "Arrow Youth," said she to him, "I have come to get you, I shall take you up through the zenith," said she to him. "Let us go, I have come to get you," said she to him. Then Arrow Youth spoke thus, "How can I go up?" said Arrow Youth. Then the eagle spoke thus, "Indeed, here," said she. Both eagles were sisters. Now they had gone to get Arrow Youth. "Now let us go," said she to him. "I shall take you on my back," said the eagle to him. Then Arrow Youth went there. He was carrying (arrows) all the time. Then her sister carried the arrows. Then the eagle spoke thus, "Do not open your eyes!" said she to him. "You will shut your eyes," said she to him. Then she flew north and carried Arrow Youth on her back, but her sister carried his bow and arrows. Then they went up. Together (with him) the eagles flew up. Then thither up to the zenith they went. Then they came out through the zenith. Up there somewhere was a rock, a large rock. The eagle girls alighted on it. The eagles carried Arrow Youth on their backs. Under the rock were many rattlesnakes. Then the eagle spoke thus, "Keep still for a while!" said she. "Arrow Youth is sitting above," said the eagle. Then the rattle snakes entered under the rock. Then the eagle spoke thus, "It is here where they call you," said the eagle. Thus she said to <FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>

<P>Arrow Youth. Then he went north. There was a kiva. He climbed up to the top and peeped in through the trap door. There Ma*'s&#146;ewa and O'yoyewa were fighting. Then Arrow Youth shouted down. But the eagle girls remained on the rock. Then the eagle spoke thus, "Arrow Youth, now you will go," said the eagle to him. "If you had not arrived here I and my sister would be dried up,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> said the elder eagle. Then Arrow Youth shouted down, "Down below inside!" said he. Then Ma*'s&#146;ewa spoke thus, "Well, somebody is speaking there," said Ma*'s&#146;ewa. Then O'yoyewa heard it. "Come in!" said he to Arrow Youth. Then Arrow Youth entered downward. "Have you come?" said Ma*'s&#146;ewa to him. "Yes," said Arrow Youth. "I called you here," said he to him. "In this poor village here everything is getting dry," said Ma*'s&#146;ewa to him. He told Arrow Youth, "Therefore I called you here," said Ma*'s&#146;ewa. "There on the north side somewhere all, oh my! have been locked up. There is no more rain," said Ma*'s&#146;ewa. "Everything here is getting dry." Then Arrow Youth spoke thus, "Two eagle girls brought me here," said Arrow Youth. "Below is my house. I left my poor wife. I was hunting rabbits," said Arrow Youth. "Then the two eagle girls came to get me," said Arrow Youth. He told Ma*'s&#146;ewa. "Then the eagle girls took me up through the zenith," said Arrow Youth. "So you are the one who called me here," said be to Ma*'s&#146;ewa. Then "Yes," said Ma*'s&#146;ewa, "I called you here together with my brother O'yoyewa," said Ma*'s&#146;ewa. "Let us go, let us go together," said Ma*'s&#146;ewa. Then together they took their arrows. Then they went together northward. Then they came out. That bad one Wind Maker dwelt there. Outside stood a cottonwood tree and on top was a goose (?) who was watching. They came from the south, Arrow Youth, Ma*'s&#146;ewa and O'yoyewa together shot with arrows. Then Arrow Youth spoke thus, "I shall shoot the goose who is sitting on top of the cottonwood tree," said Arrow Youth. "You," said he to Ma*'s&#146;ewa, "shoot Wind Maker who dwells below," said Arrow Youth, "you will shoot that one," said he to Ma*'s&#146;ewa. "You, O'yoyewa, will shoot the one below (?)," said he to him. Then Arrow Youth shot the goose (?) sitting on top. Then he killed it. Below was the bad Wind Maker. Then on the one side fell down the goose (?). Arrow Youth had killed it. Then Wind Maker spoke thus, "Oh my!" said she, "never has anyone done this to me," said Wind Maker Old Woman. Then she spoke thus, "Oh my! who are you? you are bad!" said she to Arrow Youth. "Oh</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_34"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 34</FONT></A></P>
<P>my! never has anyone done this to me," said she. Then Ma*'s&#146;ewa and O'yoyewa and Arrow Youth arrived together where Wind Maker was. She had locked up all the kopishtaya. Therefore it did not rain at all. Therefore everything became dry in the village. It never rained any more. Therefore they had gone to get Arrow Youth who was to kill Wind Maker Old Woman. She was very bad, monstrous. Then Arrow Youth killed Wind Maker Old Woman. He cut her open. Her heart was pure cactus. Then he made her heart different. He made a heart for her out of corn. Then he made her alive again. Then he sent her to the southwest. "From there you will give life," said he to Wind Maker Old Woman. "There you will dwell," said Arrow Youth to her. "From there you will give life," said he to her. Then she went southwestward. Then Wind Maker Old Woman went away.</P>
<P>Then they arrived there below at Wind Maker Old Woman. Wind Maker Old Woman had a kiva. Then&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> she spoke thus, "Arrow Youth and Ma*'s&#146;ewa and O'yoyewa," Wind Maker Old Woman said, "how did you get here? You are the bad one who killed my goose," said Wind Maker Old Woman. "He was the one who watches me," said she. "Oh my! You Arrow Youth are most powerful," said she. Then Wind Maker Old Woman spoke thus, "Oh my! Never has anyone done this to me," said she. "Now again!" said she. "To-day you arrived at my house, Ma*'s&#146;ewa and O'yoyewa and Arrow Youth together. Nobody else has ever arrived here. Let us enter inside!" said she. Then together they climbed the kiva which Wind Maker Old Woman had. Then they went in together. Then inside she spoke thus. "Sit down!" said she. "Here Arrow Youth," said she, "we two will find each other, Arrow Youth," said she. "You, Ma*'s&#146;ewa and O'yoyewa will sit down here, both of you," said Wind Maker Old Woman. Then she spoke thus, "I," said Wind Maker Old Woman, "I am going to hide first," said she. "You Arrow Youth, will hide afterwards," she said to Arrow Youth. "Four times," said Wind Maker Old Woman, "we two shall hide, both of us," said she. Then Wind Maker Old Woman hid. First Wind Maker Old Woman hid in her ear. Then Arrow Youth spoke thus, "Come here, you are hidden in your ear," said Arrow Youth. Then Wind Maker Old Woman came out there. She spoke thus, "Confound it! Oh my!" said Wind Maker Old Woman. "Never has anyone done this to me," said Wind Maker Old Woman. "You are too bad," said she. to Arrow Youth. Then he had won the kopishtaya who were locked up in the north room. Then, she spoke thus, "Now you hide next," said she to Arrow Youth. Then Arrow Youth hid next. Then Wind Maker Old Woman spoke thus, <FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_35"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 35</FONT></A></P>
<P>"Come here! You are in your ear. Now come!" said Wind Maker Old Woman. Then Arrow Youth did not come from anywhere. She had not found him.</P>
<P>Then next Wind Maker Old Woman hid again. Then a ladder was standing up. There Wind Maker Old Woman hid. Then Arrow Youth spoke thus, "Come here! You are in the rung of the ladder. Come here!" said Arrow Youth to her. Then he had found her again. Then Wind Maker Old Woman spoke thus, "Confound it! Oh my!" said she. "Never has anyone done this to me," said Wind Maker Old Woman. Then he won also those in the west room. Arrow Youth had won the kopishtaya who were locked up. Then Arrow Youth also hid, it was his turn next. Then Wind Maker Old Woman spoke thus, "Come here!" said she to him. "You are in that rung of the ladder. Come here!" said Wind Maker Old Woman to him. Then Arrow Youth did not come. She had not found him. Then Wind Maker Old Woman spoke thus, "Confound it! Oh my! You are bad!" said she. "Never has anyone done this to me. You are powerful," said Wind Maker Old Woman. Then he had won again. Then next, Wind Maker Old Woman hid again. There somewhere in the northeast where many elks were standing, she entered the anus of the last elk standing there. Then she stopped in the first one that was standing in the north. Then Arrow Youth spoke thus, "Here you went, there where the elks are standing in the northeast, and you entered the last one standing there and you stopped in the first one standing there. Now come!" said Arrow Youth to her. He called Wind Maker Old Woman. Then at once she jumped down. Again he had found her. Then Wind Maker Old Woman said again, "Confound it! Oh my!" said she. "Never has anyone done this to me," said Wind Maker Old Woman. Then Arrow Youth had won the kopishtaya in the south room. Next Arrow Youth hid. Then she said this to him, "You went there," said Wind Maker Old Woman. "There in the north where the elks are standing you entered the last one and you stopped in the first one standing in the north. Now come here!" said Wind Maker Old Woman. Then she had not found him. Arrow Youth did not come from anywhere. Then she spoke thus, "Do come here, Arrow Youth, wherever you may be, come!" said Wind Maker Old Woman. Again she had not found him. Then Arrow Youth had won again.</P>
<P>Then Wind Maker Old Woman spoke thus, "Confound it! Oh my!" said she. Then she hid again. She sat down on the top of the ladder. Then next Arrow Youth searched for Wind Maker Old Woman. Then Arrow Youth spoke, thus, "You went out from here and you are above on top of the ladder. Now come here,"</P>
<P><A NAME="page_36"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 36</FONT></A></P>
<P>said he to her. "You are on top of the ladder. Now come here," said he to her. Then again Wind Maker Old Woman jumped down. Then, "Confound it! Oh my!" said she, "You are bad," said she. "Never has anyone done this to me," said Wind Maker Old Woman. Then next Arrow Youth hid. Then she was searching for him. Not at all anywhere did she find him. Then Wind Maker Old Woman spoke thus, "Come here!" said she, "wherever you come from," said she to Arrow Youth. Then Arrow Youth entered. Then Wind Maker Old Woman spoke thus, "You have, won also those in the east," said she. Then Arrow Youth spoke thus, "It is good," said he. "Just once more," said Arrow Youth. "Then I shall have won all of them," said he to Wind Maker Old Woman. Then she spoke again thus, "Just once more," said Wind Maker Old Woman. "Then you will have won all of them from me," said she. "Yes," said Arrow Youth. "Once more, and I shall have won all of them from you," said Arrow Youth. Then Wind Maker Old Woman hid again. Then everything became dark. Then Arrow Youth spoke thus, "Oh dear," said he, "Whither did she go? She is no more visible," said Arrow Youth. Then he took something, an eagle feather. He took one feather. He took it out. Then he spoke thus, "You, eagle feather," said he, "will search for her," said he to it. "Whither did Wind Maker Old Woman go?" said he. Then he placed it upright, the eagle feather bent down northward. She was not anywhere. Again westward; again southward; again eastward. Not anywhere did he find her. Then he put it upward. Then, however, the eagle feather went up. Then Arrow Youth spoke thus, "She went up," said Arrow Youth. Then he spoke thus, "You went this way," said he to her. "Then above you covered the sun with your clitoris. Now come out," said he to her.</P>
<P>Then at once it became daylight. At once Wind Maker Old Woman came in. Then she spoke thus, "Confound it! Oh my!" said she. "Never has anyone done this to me," said she. "You are bad," said she to Arrow Youth. Then she spoke thus, "Now you have won all of them," said she. "Oh my! You are most powerful," said she. She said to Arrow Youth, "Now you have won all of them," said she. Then Wind Maker Old Woman spoke thus, "For all the kopishtaya who are locked up in the north, west, south, and east rooms, you will open for all of them," said she to him. Then Arrow Youth told Ma*'s&#146;ewa and O'yoyewa. He spoke thus, "I won all of them, all whom she had locked up," said Arrow Youth. "Now, Ma*'s&#146;ewa and O'yoyewa, we will take out all of them," said Arrow Youth. Then Ma*'s&#146;ewa spoke thus, "Thank you, Arrow Youth, father," said Ma*'s&#146;ewa. "Thank you, now you have won all the kopishtaya," said Ma*'s&#146;ewa. Then Wind Maker Old Woman spoke</P>
<P><A NAME="page_37"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 37</FONT></A></P>
<P>thus, "Now," said she, "Arrow Youth, father," said Wind Maker Old Woman. "Now I give up to you all the kopishtaya," said she. Then Arrow Youth spoke thus, "Now then," said he. Then he killed her. Then he split her. With flint he split her. Her heart was pure cactus. Such was her heart. Therefore she had no pity on anyone. Her heart was cactus. Then he made her heart different. He made a heart for her of corn. Then they resuscitated her. Then he said to her this, "You, Wind Maker Old Woman, you will go southwestward," said Arrow Youth to her. Thus he spoke, "There you shall give life," said he to her. Then Wind Maker Old Woman went southwest to some place and she dwells there somewhere on the southwest side. There she makes wind from the southwest. There she gives life. But Arrow Youth, together with Ma*'s&#146;ewa and O'yoyewa, got out (the kopishtaya). Now first Arrow Youth opened the north room. Then he opened it for the kopishtaya who were in the north room. Oh my! Some of the poor kopishtaya fell down. Then he opened for them, but at once it thundered. At once from the north clouds came up everywhere. Then he opened also the west side and there were locked up other kopishtaya. He took them out. Then clouds came up from the west. Also at once it thundered and it began to rain. Then Arrow Youth opened also the south side. Then he took out those who were locked up in the south room. Also from the south clouds came up. Then it began. to rain a little. Then he opened the east side. He entered the room. Then Ma*'s&#146;ewa and O'yoyewa and Arrow Youth together took out one after another the kopishtaya who had been locked up inside. Then he also opened the east room. Oh my! Now the poor kopishtaya were starving of hunger. They had nothing to eat and no water to drink. Too bad! The poor ones were starving of hunger. Wind Maker Old Woman was very bad. She locked up all the kopishtaya, therefore here above in this town below there was no rain. Oh my! The poor ones, everything became dry. There was no more rain, because, Oh my! Wind Maker Old Woman had locked up all the kopishtaya. "Thank you," said the two, Ma*'s&#146;ewa and O'yoyewa. "Arrow Youth, father, thank you. Now you have opened all the rooms," said the two, Ma*'s&#146;ewa and O'yoyewa. Then Arrow Youth spoke thus, "Now," said he, "I have liberated all the kopishtaya. I took them out," said Arrow Youth.</P>
<P>The Arrow Youth spoke thus, "Now let us go together." Arrow Youth spoke thus, "Let us go, Ma*'s&#146;ewa and O'yoyewa. Now it is so," said he, "I have sent off Wind Maker Old Woman," said Arrow Youth, "I have taken out all the kopishtaya," said Arrow Youth. "Now let us go together with the kopishtaya," said he. Wind Maker Old Woman dwelt below in the kiva. Then Arrow Youth, <FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_38"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 38</FONT></A></P>
<P>Ma*'s&#146;ewa and O'yoyewa went up and out together. They took along their bows and arrows. Then they went. They went southward. After a while it became cloudy. Then it began to thunder. Then there was much rain. Arrow Youth had taken out all of them. He was most powerful. Then it rained hard. Then here in the town they were very glad. It was raining hard. Then the people in the town below spoke thus, "Thank you, Arrow Youth, you have opened (the doors) for the kopishtaya," said all the people of the town below. "Thank you, Arrow Youth, father," they said. "Oh my! We poor ones here were dry. There was never any rain," said they in the town below. Oh my! The poor people were very glad. It was raining hard. Now it was so.</P>
<P>Then Ma*'s&#146;ewa and O'yoyewa arrived at their house, together with Arrow Youth. They entered the kiva together with Arrow Youth. They took him into it. Ma*'s&#146;ewa and O'yoyewa dwelt there. They are always fighting. They are playing inside. Then Ma*'s&#146;ewa spoke thus. He said this to Arrow Youth, "Thank you," said Ma*'s&#146;ewa, "Arrow Youth, father, thank you. Now you have taken out all the kopishtaya. Thank you, Arrow Youth. You have magic power," said he to him. "Thanks," said he.</P>
<P>Then Arrow Youth was about to go home. Arrow Youth spoke thus, "Now I shall go to my home," said he. "There is very much rain now," said he. "I shall go to my home," said Arrow Youth. Then Ma*'s&#146;ewa spoke thus, "Thank you," said he. "You will go to your home. Thereabouts in the south above the two eagle girls are sitting on the rock," said Ma*'s&#146;ewa. "The eagle girls are very wet where they are sitting. The two eagle girls are very glad. They will be waiting for you to arrive. The eagle girls will take you to your home," said Ma*'s&#146;ewa. "Thank you, Arrow Youth, father," said Ma*'s&#146;ewa; and O'yoyewa, "Thank you, Arrow Youth," said he to Arrow Youth. Then Arrow Youth went. "Goodbye," said he to Ma*'s&#146;ewa. Then both Ma*'s&#146;ewa and O'yoyewa went out. They both said, "Goodbye." Then he went out somewhere to the south where the two eagle girls were sitting on the rock. Down there was a large rock on which they were. Under it were many rattlesnakes. Then Arrow Youth came from the north. He was shooting his arrows. He arrived at the place where the eagle girls were sitting where the large rock was. Then the rattlesnakes came out from under. There were many rattlesnakes around the rock, large snakes. Then the eagle spoke thus, "Be quiet," said the eagle. "Arrow Youth will climb up," said the eagle. Then the rattlesnakes went in underneath (the rock). Arrow Youth climbed up the rock on which the eagle girls were sitting. Then the eagle spoke thus, "Are you here, Arrow Youth?" said she. Then Arrow Youth spoke thus, "Yes," said he. <FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_39"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 39</FONT></A></P>
<P>"I have arrived here," said Arrow Youth. Then the eagle girls shook themselves violently. It was raining very hard. The two eagle girls were very glad. The eagle said, "Arrow Youth, you have opened (the rooms) for all of them," said the eagle. "Now let us go to your home!" said she to him. Thus said the eagle, "Come here!" said the eagle who was the elder sister; the younger sister was to carry (the bow and arrows). Then the elder one took Arrow Youth on her back. They entered somewhere there downward from above the zenith. They entered downward. They could not enter upward. It was very windy above. Then they entered downward from above, but upward they were always caused to fly. The wind was blowing strongly upward. Then they landed down below together at Arrow Youth's house. They took him to his house. Arrow Youth entered, and the eagle girls went to where they dwelt. Then the mother of the two eagles said, "Are you here?" said she. Thus she said to her two children. "Did you arrive here, my children?" said she. "Yes," said the elder eagle. She said to her mother, "Up there above in the zenith there is much rain," said the eagle. "We have taken Arrow Youth to his home," said the eagle. She told her mother. Then her mother spoke thus, "Thank you, Arrow Youth is very supernatural," said the mother of the two eagles. Then she gave the eagle girls to eat. Their mother made much wafer bread. The father of the eagle girls was not there. "He is out hunting deer," said their mother. She told both the sisters when they arrived. In the evening the father of the eagles arrived. In the evening he brought a deer. The father of the eagles carried a whole deer on his back. Then both the eagle girls, who were sisters, took the deer. They put it down in front of the fireplace. Then the younger one went to take sacred meal. They fed the sacred meal to the deer. Then the mother of the eagles gave wafer bread to her husband, the eagle, who was to eat it. He had killed a deer. He had killed a buck. Then their father was eating the deer. Then, "Thanks," said the eagle. He had finished eating wafer bread. "I have eaten much," said the eagle, their father. Then he gave her the deer and she put it away. "Thank you, you killed a deer," said she to her husband.</P>

<P>Arrow Boy was hunting. He met two Eagle Girls. "Hello," he said. "Hello," they answered, "are you hunting?" They invited him to come to their house up on a high cliff. They said to each</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_40"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 40</FONT></A></P>
<P>other, "How can we take him up?" The elder said, "You take him on your back." The younger said, "You take him up, you are the elder. You might be stronger than I." "All right. I will carry him on my back." She tried many times to fly up. She was able to go a little way, and then had to give up. At last she got him up. She brought him to their house. They told him to sit down and gave him a stool all of turquoise. Their father and mother were not at home, but were out hunting. They were all alone. At last they heard their parents coming. They did not know what to do with Arrow Boy and they hid him under the blankets.</P>
<P>Their father and mother came near, and flew around the top of the house. They were bringing a buffalo that they had killed. The two girls came out to get the buffalo and flew up to meet their father and mother. They brought it in. Their father and mother sat down to rest, and the girls began to set out the food to eat. The elder sister went "Kem-kem (clearing her throat), kem-kem." Her father said, "What have you done? Anything wrong?" "My sister has done it." Again she went "Kem-kem--My sister--." Her sister poked her with her elbow to stop her. The father said, "What have, you done?" The younger sister answered, "My sister brought Arrow Boy up to our house." The mother cried, "Ahimi! (exclamation of fright). How did she ever bring him up? Where is he? I wonder you did not drop him!" "My sister hid him." They went where he was and threw the blanket off and brought him out. The mother said to Arrow Boy, "You are here?" "Yes." "How did these two girls bring you up here?" They gave him the two girls to be his wives.</P>
<P>The girls invited Arrow Boy to go out with them. Arrow Bow asked, "Where shall we go?" "We shall go up through the sky." The father said to Arrow Boy, "Are you going with my two daughters, my son? As you go through the sky the doors will open; just at the door there is a great rock where every eagle stops." He said to the elder daughter, "You are the one to carry Arrow Boy on your back. Be strong and carry him carefully." "I am strong," she answered. She put him on her back. She tried, and she fluttered back. She was not strong enough. Finally she carried him up. They went up, and they came through the sky. There were two rocks, one on each side. They rested there. Their father had told the Eagle Girls, "Arrow Boy must pick downy feathers from under each of your tails. With these he will be able to travel by himself." When he took the feathers, the girls said, "Go north, that is where they need you." He came to the house of Grandmother Spider. She said, "Have you come to bring up the war captains (i. e., Twin Brothers)? Take this root, use it when you are in danger. <FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_41"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 41</FONT></A></P>
<P>You will come to a house, and in it there will be two persons (the Twin Brothers); they will pretend that they can not hear you. Call loudly and they will answer."</P>
<P>He reached there. Those two were playing inside. He called loudly. They said, "Nobody is calling." He repeated his call, and they answered, "What? Who are you?" "It is Arrow Boy." They came running to the ladder; they looked up and saw Arrow Boy looking in. Arrow Boy came in and they gave him a stool of turquoise. They said, "This is why the Eagle Girls brought you up here. The people are troubled because they have had no rain in many years. For four years the Shiwana.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> have been shut up. Wind Maker Old Woman has imprisoned them."</P>
<P>The Twins said to Arrow Boy, "Are you ready? Yes; it is almost time for the midday meal." The Twins brought a big bowl and set it in the center of the floor. In it they put a little white cornmeal, and they poured water upon it. Masewa jumped in first, and his brother followed. They went down into another room below, and from this room the Twins came up again, all dressed in buckskin with bows and arrows. They were tall and handsome now.</P>
<P>They started off. "Do your best," they said to Arrow Boy, "we will watch you." As they went they said to him, "Have you your downy feathers?" "Yes." Masewa shot his arrow and when they had traveled the distance of that arrow, O'yoyewa shot his. Then Arrow Boy shot his. So they went, each shooting his arrow in turn and traveling on their arrows.</P>
<P>They came near to where Wind Maker Old Woman lived. They told Arrow Boy, "There is a big pine, and on top there is always a watcher to guard Wind Maker Old Woman who sits under the tree. She is mending things, always mending." When they came to the pine tree Arrow Bow raised his bow and shot his arrow at the watchman. It went through his body and he fell down just where the old woman was sitting. She was frightened. She cried, "Whoever has done this? Nobody ever did this before. They have killed my watchman." They came close to the old woman and called, "Hello." She answered, "Are you the, ones who killed my watchman?" She invited them to come in, but they knew all about her already. She said, "Sit down, grandchildren, I will give you something to eat." She went in and brought out a skull. "This tastes very nice," she said, "do you like this?" They all three said, "No, we don't like that. We never ate that. We have brought our food." When they had finished eating she said, "Come on, boys,</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_42"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 42</FONT></A></P>
<P>and let us play hide and seek." They were to hide four times. They bet their lives on not being found.</P>
<P>Arrow Boy hid first. When he was ready Wind Maker Old Woman looked for him. She called, "Arrow Boy, as you went up the ladder you hid behind the door. Come out!" But he was not there; she had made a mistake. He was on top of the roof. So he won the first hiding. She said, "What a brave boy you are. Nobody has ever beaten me before as you have done now." But Arrow Boy had used the root which Grandmother Spider gave him. It was her turn. When she was ready, Arrow Boy called, "Gotcadutcka, you went up and hid in the rafters. Come out!" She came out. Arrow Boy had won the first round.</P>
<P>It was Arrow Boy's turn again. The Twins were sitting there with a white manta around them. He hid under this. Wind Maker Old Woman called, "Arrow Boy, come out. You are behind the ladder." But he did not come out, for he was not behind the ladder. So she lost again; now it was her turn. She went to hide under the white manta. Arrow Boy called, "Come out, for you are under the white manta." "What a smart boy you are, you always find me!" It was Arrow Boy's turn. He hid to the east where the sun comes up, where there are many deer. He went into the anus of the last deer and came into the very front of his antlers. Wind Maker Old Woman called, "There you go, Arrow Boy. You went up the ladder and hid behind the door." But nobody came out, for he was not there. "What a smart boy you are," she cried. "Nobody ever did such harm as you. Come out, wherever you are." He came out. This was the fourth time that he had won. It was her turn. She went up to the sky and to the sun. She hid there. When Arrow Boy called, he said, "As you went that way, Wind Maker Old Woman, you went to the sky and to the sun. There you are hiding. Come down!" She came down. She said, "What a smart boy you are." Then the sun began to shine again. Then she said, "In this contest Arrow Boy has beaten me. Let me eat my skull first (i. e., before I die)." Arrow Boy answered, "All right." She ate it, and he killed her. When he opened her heart, inside there was nothing but splinters and cactus spines. They made her a turquoise heart so that she would not be dangerous any more.</P>
<P>When she was alive again, she went into the north room. In this room she had hidden the Shiwana. They were starving. She went into the west room and she released all the katcina. that were there. She released all those in the south room and in the east. She had shut them there for four years. Arrow Boy and the Twin Brothers went home. When the katcina were all free, it began to thunder and lighten. The clouds spread out; there was rain.</P>

<P>When the two Eagle Girls saw the lightning they knew that Arrow Boy had overcome Wind Maker Old Woman. They were both glad. Every once in a while they shook their bodies in the rain ("like all birds, glad for rain"). Arrow Boy and the Twins came down to the earth. When they were getting near to Arrow Boy's home, they came to Grandmother Spider and she said, "Are you coming back, Arrow Boy?" "Yes." "I am very pleased with you and very glad. I have seen good clouds, thunder, and lightning. Thank you for it very much. For your sake we are to have rain."</P>
<P>They came to Eagle's house. As they were climbing up, Arrow Boy saw his two Eagle wives. They were shaking their bodies because they were glad to see the pretty clouds spreading out. They greeted each other. They were very thin from fasting (to aid Arrow Boy), for they were suffering as he suffered (i. e., under the same taboos). The twins went home, and Arrow Boy came back to this village.</P>
