### BUNGLING HOST <span id="fr_163"></span>[10](#fn_162.md)

At Gamatsika Rattlesnake and Coyote lived. Coyote came in and said,
"Shall we invite each other to a great feast?" Rattlesnake said, "All
right; you be the first to call me." "All right. To-morrow I shall start
to make my paper bread." In three days the old Coyote went out to find
sheep. He found one and killed and brought it home. Night came, and he
put the meat to cook. In the morning he set the food out, the paper
bread and meat, and went out to call Rattlesnake to the feast. He came
to Rattlesnake's house and said, "I have come for you." "All right. Let
us go and have your feast." They started to the house of Coyote. Coyote
ran fast. They went in, Rattlesnake after Coyote. Coyote said, "Come in
and have a seat. You shall have your feast." Rattlesnake turned around
and coiled himself on the floor. At last he said, "Thanks, old Coyote,
but this is not what I eat. I eat sacred meal, and pollen." "What would
you eat? for this is the feast I have cooked for you." "No, thank you."
Rattlesnake went out and went home.

In the morning it was his turn to make a feast. He prepared his food as
Coyote had. The third day came and Rattlesnake went out to hunt. "I had
better get some meat," be said. "I will get two chickens for Coyote
likes them. That will be the best for the feast." Everything was ready,
and Rattlesnake went to the house of Coyote to invite him to the feast.
Coyote said to himself while he waited in his house, "Oh, I remember
that Rattlesnake has a rattle on the end of his tail. I ought to have
something, too." He went and found a dancer's gourd rattle. It was too
heavy. So he tied on corn husk. He went into Rattlesnake's house and
said, "Good morning." "Good morning," said the snake. "Sit down." Coyote
waggled his tail but not a sound could he make. Coyote went four times
around the feast Rattlesnake had set out (i. e., coiled himself four
times). He kept his eyes longingly on the feast, but at last he said,
"Thank you, but that is not the kind of food I eat. I only eat corn meal
and pollen." Rattlesnake was angry. She got ready to strike. She cried,
"You are mocking me. You ought not to have tied husks on the tip of your
tail. I have my rattle there because that was the way that I was born."
Coyote was still smacking his

lips for there were chickens in Rattlesnake's feast, but Snake came
toward him and he had to run away fast to his house. He felt very sorry
that he had lost his chance at the chickens, but he said, "If I go back
to Rattlesnake's house be will kill me. I must stay where I am."
