### THE FLOOD <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md)

Long ago the people (of that world) knew that there would be a great
flood. Up in the north among the high mountains they

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

built a great boat. When it was nearly time for the water to rise, they
began to load it with much corn and they took all the different animals
into the boat and a white pigeon. When everything was ready the sons of
the builder of the boat and their sons came into the ship. When they
were all in, they put pitch over all the cracks of the boat. The flood
came. The boat floated on the water. The people that were left on the
earth fled to the highest mountain to try to escape from the waters. The
ones who could not get to the high mountains were all drowned and
floated about on the waters of the flood. The ones who climbed the
mountains were overtaken by the water and turned into rocks. Some were
embracing each other, and some held one another on their laps, and there
they are still just as the water overtook them. Every living thing on
the earth was drowned, but the boat still floated.

When the waters went down, the boat grounded on a high place in the
mountains to the north. Then they knew the waters were subsiding. The
chief said to the rest, "We will send the white pigeon to see if the
earth is uncovered again." The white pigeon was let out. At last he
returned and told the chief, "I have seen the earth and the water has
gone down. But it is a terrible thing to see. The people are all drowned
and their bodies piled upon the ground." In the boat there was also a
crow as white as the pigeon. They sent out the crow to look over the
earth. She went out and saw the earth as the pigeon had. But she flew
down to the dead bodies and began to pick out their eyes. When she came
back to the boat, they knew she had done mischief. They said to her,
"What is it that you have done when you were out flying over the earth?
You were white and now your feathers are all black." Again they let the
pigeon out to see if the earth was firm again. She went out and as she
was flying she saw a flower in blossom. She picked the flower for a sign
that the earth was getting firm again, and she took it back to the boat.
She said to the owner of the boat, "The plants are all growing again,
and I settled on the ground and did not sink into the mud. This flower
is a sign of the growing of the plants." So the people on the boat were
saved from the first-ending-of-the-world-by-flood.

When the people who came up out of Shipap found these people who had
been saved they called them Tsauwan yabana (last year's crop people).
They were yellow like last year's corn, and their hair was curled up in
queues on their heads like last year's husks. (The narrator said they
were the Chinese and Japanese.) They were told that there would come
another destruction of the world, but it would be by fire.
