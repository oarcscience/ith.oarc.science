### WOODRATS <span id="fr_176"></span>[1](#fn_175.md)

The woodrats lived in the mountains. There were a mother and father and
lots of children. He sang for the children to dance,

I, i, i,  
Cactus, [cactus](errata.htm#1.md)  
It's useful to us (for nest)  
It's useful to us!  
Ha a yot si!

\[paragraph continues\] The little woodrats jumped and jumped and rolled
over on the ground. He said,

I'm singing for you,  
Try your best!  
Try your best!  
So we can kill a deer.

\[paragraph continues\] They tried hard and their father sang the song.
