not allowed to break. A party of men went to the mine and they started
to break these pillars. When they were breaking them, they heard a
voice, "You know you may not break this pillar. You are just allowed to

them the roof fell in on them. They were imprisoned. They cried out and
called as loudly as they could asking whoever was going by to bring a
pair of muskrat shoes (sic).

The people began to dig. When at last they uncovered them, they had all
been transformed into snakes.
