### WHY THE NAVAHO BUY SO MUCH TURQUOISE <span id="fr_210"></span>[6](#fn_209)

There is a sacred place in the Navaho country where they go to make
offerings to obtain domestic animals. If they have clean hearts and are
thinking good thoughts toward all their people, a white horse will
appear to them. So they get horses and sheep. They use some of the
turquoise for themselves, but the most of it they use for these
offerings.
