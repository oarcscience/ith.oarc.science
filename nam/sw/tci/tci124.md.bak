# II. HERO TALES

All Cochiti heroes indiscriminately are insignificant, poverty stricken
and ridiculed boys who are successful in overcoming their enemies and
mockers. The Twin Heroes are mischievous and irresponsible ([p.
19](tci023.htm#page_19).md). Arrow Boy does not hunt, and spends his time
courting the girls, for which all the boys ridicule him ([p.
43](tci028.htm#page_43).md). Poker Boy is ugly and untidy, and has singed,
bushy hair ([p. 49](tci031.htm#page_49).md). Corncob Boy is described in
identical terms, lived with his poor old grandmother and was despised by
everyone ([p. 51](tci033.htm#page_51).md). He had to eat the scraps thrown
out by other people ([p. 62](tci035.htm#page_62).md). Montezuma is a
noodle, and is mocked by everyone. (Dumarest, 228.)

There are, other stories of all of them in which they are fairly
dignified husbands, and in these cases they are described only by their
prowess in deer hunting. Shell Man ([p. 70](tci039.htm#page_70).md) appears
only in tales of this sort.

Of these heroes the Twins and Corncob Boy are clearly differentiated.
The Twins are the mischievous, fun-loving, supernaturally powerful
destroyers of the monsters of the earth, protectors of the helpless, and
institutors of customs. Corncob Boy (with whom Poker Boy is to be
identified also) is Cochiti's culture hero and his story is a curious
mixture of the destitute youth and the Christ story. Arrow Boy is on the
contrary the generic hero. The tales told of him are not considered to
be all about the same individual. Any of the stories told of unnamed
heroes, in some variant is likely to he ascribed to "Arrow Boy." This is
even clearer in the case of his female analogue, Yellow Woman. She is a
bride, a witch, the chief's daughter, the bear woman, or an ogress,
quite without regard to character.

### THE TWIN HEROES <span id="fr_222"></span>[1](#fn_220.md)

The usual pueblo incidents of the twins were recorded by Dumarest about
1900 but have not been obtained in any recent collections. Dumarest's
version ends with the establishment of the shiwana and it may be that
these tales are sacrosanct in the rain cult. The incidents of their
birth and of the two boys' visit to Father Sun are told today, however,
without mention of the twin brothers and may really have become
separated. The twins appear in the recent collections only in their rôle
as two little boys who escape from the dangerous giant and kill him, or
as the rescuer of the rabbit huntress.

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

### CHILDREN OF THE SUN

Dumarest's version, p. 216, follows closely the usual pueblo outline. It
is as follows:

While the people were living at Frijoles a very young girl asked the
sunlight for a child. Her parents turned her out on account of her
pregnancy and her children were born on the top of Bernadillo Mountains.
They were called Masewa and Oyoyewa.

(Children of the Sun: Benedict, informant 1 ([p.
23](tci024.htm#page_23).md), is a parallel tale though it is told of
Bluebird and Turquoise: A handsome girl went out from Cochiti to gather
piñons. Sun loved her and by aid of his brother and a downy feather took
her to his home in the east. He brought her back to her home before her
children were born. They were named Bluebird and Turquoise.)

(Son of Sun: Boas (p. 26). A girl had been grinding the hard blue corn
until she was very tired. She lay where the sun was shining and was
impregnated. Sun told her to tell his son when he was old enough who his
father was.)

The children wanted to hunt and she made them bows and feathered arrows.
They complained of the arrows and she told them good wood grew a day's
journey away guarded by a mountain lion. They went, shot mountain lion,
and skinned him. While they were doing this, Bear came up but they
killed him too. They stuffed Bear and dragged him back to fool their
mother. They told her how tame the dangerous animals had become, and
jumped on the stuffed Bear's back. She was terrified. They wanted
feathers for their arrows. Their mother told them they came only from a
cannibal eagle. They went In the direction where Eagle lived and on the
way had to get water from a spring guarded by Deer. Squirrel helped them
to kill him by tunneling to his heart and they shot an arrow through the
tunnel. Deer tried to gore the twins but died before he reached them.
They took out his intestines, filled them with blood and tied them
bandolier fashion over each shoulder. Eagle Swooping down caught them by
these intestines so that they were not hurt. He dropped them alongside
his nest. The intestines broke so that he thought they were dead. They
shot the grown eagle and commanded the eaglets not to eat human flesh in
the future. They returned to their mother and they made fun of the
warnings she had given them.

### VISIT TO THE SUN--(Dumarest continued)

The boys asked who their father was and was told he lived in the cast.
They arrived there and found a house whose entrance was a rainbow. Sun
was not at home and the chiefs put the boys on a pyre to test whether
they were the children of Sun. They were not burned. Sun's wife was
jealous and confined the boys successively in four rooms with prey
animals, but they played with them, using them as mounts. Sun returned
and his wife reviled him for his unfaithfulness. He acknowledged his
children.

Next day Masewa asked to carry the sun disk. He did so, but was afraid
to plunge below the horizon at sunset. Sun had to push him down. Oyoyewa
next day plunged without hesitating.

(Children of Sun, continued. See above. The boys asked for their father,
and their mother told them he lived in the east. They had to cross a
field of black arrow points set upright, but they succeeded. Sun's
father and mother were there. When Sun returned he greeted the boys and
tested them in a room of (1) snakes, (2) deer, (3) a narrow pass between
great obsidian knives, (4) carrying the sun across the sky. They were
told to tie downy

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

feathers at sunrise to their foreheads, then parrot tail feathers. They
were to stop at midday at the zenith and at a halfway point on either
side to receive offerings of sacred meal. When the Sun set they were to
plunge Into Dragon's jaws. The elder boy carried the sun disk first, but
was afraid to plunge at sunset, and the younger pushed him in. The next
day the younger was successful. Therefore Sun's father and mother knew
that these were Sun's children ([p. 24](tci025.htm#page_24).md).

(Son of Sun. Sun's son started to find. his father's house and came to
Spider Old Woman. She made medicine and blew it over them both. They
became eagles and few to Sun's house. In his house the Mint shamans were
in retreat. When his father came, the son proposed to accompany him
across the sky. The Sun told him to gather all the offerings of sacred
meal and pollen made to him, and dressed him in dancer's costume. He
took the Sun's place in the journey across the sky, but at sunset was
afraid to descend among the watersnakes. The Sun came to his rescue. The
offerings he had collected from humans were given to the Mint shamans
(of the sky) for their rites. Next day Sun's son killed a deer and took
it to his mother as a farewell gift before he returned to live with his
father Sun ([p. 26](tci025.htm#page_26))..md)

### FURTHER ADVENTURES (Dumarest, continued)

They set out to return home. Sun gave them arrows and a rabbit stick. He
warned them of their power, and told them to be careful. When they came
near a pueblo, however, they both threw their sticks and mountains were
leveled which formed the plains between the mountains of Santa Fe and
Bernadillo.

They wanted to drink at a spring guarded by a great giant. They cut him
in two with the rabbit stick, but the severed parts joined as before.
They threw again and were able to hold the 'two parts from touching one
another so that the giant died. They reached home.

### OLD WOMAN GIANTESS

(3 versions: *a* Dumarest, p. 22; *b* Benedict, informant 1. [p.
20](tci023.htm#page_20.md); *c* Benedict, informant 3, [p.
19](tci023.htm#page_19).md)

This is the part of the usual twin cycle which is commonly told in
Cochiti to-day. The Dumarest version follows closely the usual Southwest
account, but at the present time the giantess has become a giant in
Cochiti versions, probably due to the influence of the story of the
giant created ritualistically by the Giant Society to destroy an evil
child-killing giant whom he overcame and shut up in the cave in Peralta
Canyon. This cave, known as "Where the Giant is Shut up," is 40 to 50
feet up a perpendicular cliff and walled up with four enormous stones.
See Dumarest, p. 207. Both tales have come to be associated with this
cave in Cochiti.

The giant (Giantess throughout, *a*) lived at Peralta Canyon and used to
descend on Cochiti and carry off all the children in his carrying basket
(see Dumarest, p. 207). (He used to boll them in the boiling place of
Giant, *b*.)

The twins met Giant. He threw them Into his basket, but as he passed
through piñon trees, they gathered gum, plastered it on his head and set
fire to it. He ran to the river to put it out and they escaped, *b*,
*c*. He met them again and put them In his basket. They filled the
basket with stones (they

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

asked for them to bruise the leaves that children are accustomed to
suck, etc., *a*; Masewa jumped out and handed them up, *b*) and when the
basket was so heavy he did not notice the difference, they escaped
(swinging themselves out of the basket on a pine branch. Giantess told
them, "Do not go to sleep, you are too heavy when you go to sleep,"
*a*). He found them again and took them to his house (he ate rotten
human heads and offered them to the twins, *a*). A great fire was
burning there with which to cook them, but they were unharmed (because
they were children of Sun, *a*; because the mud with which they were
plastered cooled the water, *b*). They opened the oven door and put
manure in their place. Next morning Giant took out the feast (and saw it
was manure, *b*; and ate it with relish, thinking it was the children.
The twins, hidden in bowls, mocked Giant, and he thinking it was the
bowls that spoke broke the bowls and they jumped out. She made up
another fire and they pushed her in and killed her, *a*. No killing of
Giant is given. The story is only one of the practical jokes perpetrated
on him, *b*).

When he found the twins had escaped he went after them to his home and
brought them again to his cave, but they killed him with their obsidian
knives and walled him up in the cave, *c*.

The story of the children-killing giant--not a story of the twin
heroes--which probably modified the above tale is as follows:

Long ago, when the people lived at Tiputse the witches made a giant who
came down and ate the children. The Giant Society asked Our Mother to
help, so they put a grain of corn under a white manta, and prayed, and a
giant was created. This giant, when he learned the purpose of his
creation, came against and taunted the witch giant, and the two fought
each other with thunder knife and war club, the witch giant, being the
older, having the first four blows. The first stroke of the good giant
destroyed the other, who was found to have a heart filled with cactus
spines. This was replaced with one of turquoise, and Our Mother put
marks upon him so that he should henceforth be the helper of the people.
The good giant was sung back to Our Mother, and the bad one shut up in
the cave "Where the giant is shut up" ([p. 17](tci021.htm#page_17).md).

### RABBIT HUNTRESS

(3 versions: Boas, p. 21; Benedict, informant 1 (omitted); Benedict,
informant 3 (omitted).)

The twins are also shown as protectors of the unfortunate rabbit
huntress. After they had rescued her from the ogre they instituted the
proper way of living, that is, women shall stay at home and men shall
hunt. (For abstracts, see [p. 227](tci125.htm#page_227)..md)

### THE TWINS OBTAIN THE RAIN-MAKING OBJECTS AND THE MASKS OF THE SHIWANA

(Dumarest, p. 226)

There was a great drought. The twins came to a great hole into Wenima
and heard from it the songs of the Shiwana. They cast themselves down.
When they recovered from the force of the fall they saw it was such a
beautiful place, they thought it was very natural the Shiwana had not
come to visit the earth. Heluta was asleep and they stole the masks and
lightnings and rose from the underworld on the bolts of the lightning.
The rains fell and the \[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

Shiwana pursued them, but said, "It is well. Now you are one of us. Keep
the masks and lightning." So they brought the Shiwana to Cochiti.

### THE TWINS RELEASE THE SHIWANA

Another and different story is told of the twins and the Shiwana. In
Cochiti to-day the dominant rôle in this tale is given to Arrow Boy, see
notes, page [215](#page_215.md), but in Dumarest's abbreviated version it
is given to the Twins.

Kotshatosha had imprisoned the Shiwana and the twins contested with her
in a game of hide and seek with the Shiwana as stake. They won and
released the rains. (Dumarest, p. 234.)

The names of the twins are used as designations for the two war captains
who function for yearly terms in the religious and secular government of
Cochiti (see Goldfrank, p. 24), as pp. [43](tci028.htm#page_43.md),
[44](tci029.htm#page_44), [54](tci034.htm#page_54.md),
[64](tci037.htm#page_64.md), etc. Similarly, the terms apply to the
war-captain guardians at the entrance of the house of Uretsete
(Dumarest, p. 227), they lead the people at the emergence ([p.
13](tci015.htm#page_13).md), and they allot territory to the people of the
earth before leaving Shipap ([p. 7](tci008.htm#page_7).md). The bridge
between these two concepts is given in Dumarest: "When Masewa and
Uyuyewa (i. e., the twin heroes) died they went to Shipap to guard
Uretsete" ([p. 227](tci125.htm#page_227).md).

The following is the only tale of Sun's son which has no analogue in the
Cochiti stories of the twins:

### THE CHILD OF THE SUN RETURNS TO DANCE WITH HIS MOTHER

A girl who lived at White House refused to marry, but, while she lay In
the sun in the hatchway, was impregnated by Sun and bore a child.
Because the baby was fatherless, it was put on a cradle board and thrown
into a spring, but his father Sun took him. When he was grown, Sun
dressed him as a katcina and returned him to the village. Sun's son
asked to dance the harvest dance, Uatyautci, for them, and selected his
own mother for his partner. When the dance was almost over, he let fly
his downy feather, and both were drawn up to Sun. So the boy took his
mother back to her husband ([p. 31](tci026.htm#page_31).md).

### ARROW BOY

Arrow Boy is the stock name for the hero in Cochiti. The tales that are
told of him are not felt to belong to one integrated biography. He is a
poor, despised boy, like all other Cochiti heroes, and he overcomes his
detractors in a ceremonial deer hunt. Perhaps the favorite tale is that
of his releasing of the Shiwana <span id="fr_223"></span>[2](#fn_221.md)
from Wind Maker Old Woman. In another tale he follows his wife to the
sky world where she has been taken by his pet eagle whom she has
neglected to feed. Several tales which are told of Arrow Boy in one
version and of unnamed heroes in others are discussed in their
appropriate places among the novelistic tales. These are: The Abduction
of Arrow Boy's Wife, [p. 66](tci038.htm#page_66.md), notes, [p.
230](tci125.htm#page_230.md); Arrow Boy \[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

Kills His Bear Children When They Come to Reap Their Father's Field, [p.
111](tci058.htm#page_111), notes, [p. 229](tci125.htm#page_229.md); Arrow
Boy, the Child of a Witch Father, born after his mother had succeeded in
exposing and killing her witch husband, [p. 92](tci048.htm#page_92.md),
notes, [p. 232](tci125.htm#page_232.md).

### ARROW BOY RELEASES THE SHIWANA

(4 versions: *a* Boas, p. 32; *b* Dumarest, p. 233; *c* Benedict,
Informant 1, p. 39; *d* Benedict, Informant 3 (omitted).)

This is the story of Arrow Boy's journey to sky land to release the
rains which have been imprisoned by an old woman there. Version *b*
recorded by Dumarest about 1900 ascribes this exploit to the twins (only
the culminating incident is given), and their subordinate rôle in the
more recent texts is probably due to the influence of versions such as
that recorded by Boas from Laguna, (loc. cit., p. 76) in which the
gambler is similarly overcome by Sun Youth, an analogue of Arrow Boy.

Arrow Boy was a great hunter and while hunting he met two girls, Eagles,
the elder of whom flew up with him on her back to their home on a high
cliff. Their parents came home bringing a buffalo and gave him the girls
as wives, *c*.

Arrow Youth lived with his wife Yellow Woman, but was stolen by a female
eagle, who with her sister swooped from the sky while he was hunting
rabbits. They took him to the zenith, *a*.

They took him to the sky to release the Shiwana held captive by Wind
Maker Old Woman. The eagle girls took him to the rock at the entrance to
sky land (under which there were many dangerous rattlesnakes, *a*).
(They sent him on with downy feathers plucked from under their, tails by
means of which he traveled. He came to Spider Old Woman (to Macawi,
Black Buzzard, a katcina, *b*) who directed him to the kiva of the twin
brothers, *c*, *d*.) (They direct him to return the following day and he
flies down on the back of Eagle Girls and back again the next day, *c*,
*d*. They travel on feathers plucked from under the eagle girls' tail,
*c*, on their arrows that they shoot as they go, *c*, on Arrow Boy's,
*d*.)

They come to Wind Maker Old Woman who has imprisoned the Shiwana. (In
version *a* Arrow Boy at this time kills Wind Maker Woman, cuts out her
cactus heart and substitutes one of corn. He sends her southwest to
live. This incident is repeated after the hide and seek contest in this
version, and is obviously misplaced. They follow her to her home, kill
her watchman, and challenge her to hide and seek, *a*.)

She offered them skulls to eat but they refused, *c*.

They contested with her (in a throwing contest, in which the articles
the twins threw became birds so that they won, *d*; in a hide and seek
contest where Wind Maker Old Woman hides in various places in the room
and finally in the sun but is guessed by Arrow Boy, *c*; in a hide and
seek contest on each turn of which the Shiwana of one room are staked.
She is discovered by Arrow Boy hiding in her own ear, in the rung of the
ladder, in the anus of the last reindeer in the northeast, on top of the
sun where he finds her by

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

holding up an eagle feather as if to catch the direction of the wind.
Again they kill her and replace her heart, *a*. The twins hid under a
deer lying down, the woman in the intestine of a rabbit, the twins in
the queue of a woman, the woman covered the sun with her queue, and the
twins found her by following a downy feather. They won the shiwana, *b*.
Dumarest).

Therefore they won back the rain. They killed Wind Maker Old Woman and
took out her heart, giving her a good turquoise one, *c*. They released
all the Shiwana in the four rooms and it began to rain. Arrow Boy went
back to (the Eagle Girls, *a*; his eagle wives, *c*, *d*), whom he had
told that rain and lightning would be a sign of his success. They
carried him back to this world (all versions).

Version *a* ends with the Eagle Girls' return to their home after they
had taken Arrow Boy to Cochiti. Their father brought home a buck which
they placed in front of the fireplace and fed with sacred meal, thanking
their father, *a*. (See Introduction of versions *c*, *d*.)

The incident of Arrow Boy's meeting with the eagle girls, version is
reproduced exactly as the introduction to the tale of Arrow Boy's son
who brings back eagle powers to the village. It continues:

After Arrow Boy has been married to Eagle Girls for some time and the
elder sister has a child, he proposes to them the test of meal ground so
fine it will adhere to the side of the grinding stone. They finally
succeed and therefore he takes them with him to Cochiti as his wives.
His son grows up there and has eagle powers ([p.
45](tci029.htm#page_45).md). (See also same for Poker Boy, [p.
217](#page_217)..md)

### ARROW BOY OVERCOMES THOSE WHO HAVE MOCKED HIM

Arrow Boy, the cacique's grandson, was an effeminate youth who did not
learn to hunt, etc., but spent his time courting the girls in the
pueblo. To shame him it was arranged that he should be put in charge of
the ceremonial deer hunt, But Arrow Boy fulfilled all the ceremonial
obligations and was successful. His grandfather had him initiated into
the Flint society and he became cacique ([p. 43](tci028.htm#page_43).md).

### ARROW BOY'S WIFE IS TAKEN TO THE SKY BY HIS EAGLE

Arrow Boy lived at Potsherd Place with his wife Yellow Woman. They had
an eagle that she had to feed when Arrow Boy was not there. She became
neglectful and the eagle escaped. She followed him, taking a white manta
to catch him. She chased him to Whirlpool Place, then he lit on a rock
and told her to fold the manta and sit on it. She was asked to close her
eyes, and he carried her into the next world. He lit on the great rock
where all eagles must light and left her there. He told her that she
must shift for herself because she had been unkind to him. He returned
to the world but did not tell Arrow Boy where his wife was. He was
unable to trace her farther than Whirlpool Place and he mourned for her
constantly. Grandmother Spider took pity on him, told him where his wife
was, and offered to take him to the next world. He got on her back, and
after an unsuccessful attempt, because he opened his eyes, she brought
him to the great rock. She directed him along the middle road to the
house of her sister who told him where to find his wife. He came to a
house where he stayed that night, and on the following day, he killed
turkeys for the feast to which the mother of that house invited his
wife. They hid Arrow Boy under a sheepskin when she came in. They placed

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

the food before her, and she recalled her life with him. When he heard
this, he asked if she would like to live that life over again. She was
happy when she found him in his hiding place. The mother of the house
told him to take two turkeys to pay Gawi’ma for finding his wife, and
this he did ([p. 47](tci030.htm#page_47).md).

### POKER BOY

Poker Boy is a subordinate name for the hero in Cochiti. In one version
of Corncob Boy's marriage, with the chief's daughters and his magic
contest to retain them, he is called Poker Boy for the first half of the
story (p. 60, note 1). The following incident is also told of Poker Boy,
though elsewhere (p. 46) it is connected with Arrow Boy's son:

### THE CONTEST OF POKER BOY'S WIVES

Poker Boy lived at Old Pueblo. He was a great hunter and married to
Yellow Woman. Her youngest sister, Blue Woman, was in love with her
sister's husband, and they contested with finely ground flour as to
which was to possess him. That one was to be successful whose flour was
so fine It adhered to a polished floor-rubbing stone set upright. They
each threw four times and were unsuccessful. At last the old woman told
them to parch white corn before grinding. They did so and Yellow Woman
threw first. Her meal stuck. So she got her husband back again ([p.
49](tci031.htm#page_49).md). (See also same for Arrow Boy, [p.
216](#page_216)..md)

### POKER BOY RETIRES INTO HIS SHRINE

The one fixed fact about Poker Boy is his shrine, the Shrine of Yellow
Woman, which he shares with Corncob Boy. The following story is told of
his going into his shrine.

The people were living at White House. Poker Boy herded his turkeys by
the sweet sound of his flute. He drew his turkeys and wives with their
babies with him far to the south to the Shrine of Yellow Woman where he
gives blessing In hunting and the bearing of children ([p.
50](tci032.htm#page_50).md).

### CORNCOB BOY

Corncob Boy is the local culture hero of Cochiti. He belongs to Cochiti,
and the other pueblos are said to be in awe of this little village
because of his blessing. His shrine is near by, the Shrine of Yellow
Woman (see Poker Boy, above). In his youth he is mocked as a poor
orphan, but he vindicates himself by his successful management of the
ceremonial rabbit hunt. He foretells the weather and teaches the people
all the customs of healing, hunting, fishing and warfare. He foretold
the coming of the Whites and the strange fruits and animals they would
bring ([p. 64](tci037.htm#page_64).md).

The name of Poker Boy is used interchangeably with Corncob Boy in one
version ([p. 60](tci034.htm#page_60).md). Both names are associated with
the shrine of Yellow Woman. The story as it stands is a curious mixture,
with its affinities on the one hand to that of the dirty dwarfish twin
heroes of the western pueblos and on the other to that of the Christ
asking

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

the mercy of the angry God his father, and bearing the people's prayer
for forgiveness.

### CORNCOB BOY MARRIES THE CHIEF'S DAUGHTERS AND SUBMITS TO TESTS TO RETAIN THEM

(2 versions: *a* Boas, p. 51; *b* Benedict, Informant 1 ([p.
60](tci034.htm#page_60.md), first part omitted; divergences noted in
abstract).)

Corncob Boy was an untidy singed-haired orphan living with his
grandmother. The cacique's daughters, however, chose him to make their
rabbit sticks at the ceremonial rabbit hunt, and he killed all the
rabbits. He married them. <span id="fr_224"></span>[2](#fn_222.md) The rest
of the men in the village were jealous and arranged contests with him on
which his wives were staked. (Poker Boy (sic) won the first contest
because he did not bleed when he was whipped, *b*.) They contested to
determine whose hair was longest. He purified himself by vomiting and
(Spider sent him to the turkeys, *b*; the chief's daughters called their
turkeys, *a*) who pulled each hair till it swept the ground when he sat
on top of the kiva ladder. The last contest was one of food stores. The
men of the village painted stones to look like corn and melons (but
Corncob Boy followed coyote's seed-filled droppings till he found his
stores underground, in Shipap, and was given a well-stocked house which
became large when it was set up where he lived, *b*; but the chief's
daughters swept his house and gave him four large rooms filled with corn
and melons, *a*).

Again they contested as to the parentage of Yellow Woman's child, who
had by now been born. All the contestants and the chief's family
purified themselves four days by vomiting, and came to the kiva. All the
men held flowers to the baby but he paid no attention to any except
Corncob Boy. *a*.

### CORNCOB BOY DEPARTS AND WITHHOLDS THE RAINS (same tale continued)

In order to show the people "who maintained them," Corncob Boy departed
northwestward. He left inexhaustible supplies with his wives, and told
them to give to the people when they were in distress. (He never came
back any more, *a*.)

(Because of their sins, Heluta withheld the rains, giving only to his
song Corncob Boy, Inexhaustible supplies and commanding him to give
freely to the people. When the people repented they besought Corncob,
Boy as Intermediary with his father and he sent Coyote to Shipap. Heluta
blessed them with the Institution of the Giant Society and it began to
rain ([p. 62](tci035.htm#page_62))..md)

### CORNCOB BOY MARRIES DEER PLANTER'S DAUGHTER (same tale continued, *b*)

When Corncob Boy left his home he went northwest and married Heluta's
daughters. Heluta showed him his fields in which he planted dewclaws.
The ground was pricked with the antlers of tiny deer (cp. pp.
[11](tci012.htm#page_11), [25](tci025.htm#page_25).md). Corncob Boy then
planted corn and taught them to cook it. He returned to Cochiti with his
wives and disappeared into his shrine, the Shrine of Yellow Woman, *b*.

The Cochiti version of this story does not specify that this is the
culture tale of the introduction of deer, as does the Navaho, for
instance, but it is regarded as implicit in the tales. On the other
hand, the fact that this is the occasion of the introduction of corn to
Heluta's people is stressed. They have to learn to like it, etc.

### CORNCOB BOY TRIUMPHS OVER HIS MOCKERS

Corncob Boy was an orphan begging scraps from door to door. Before the
ceremonial rabbit hunt the boys mocked him saying he could not kill a
rabbit. He turned their mockery against them so that no one killed any
rabbits on the hunt. The priests came to him and he told them why he had
hidden the rabbits. Masewa proclaimed a new hunt and Corncob Boy
purified himself. They caught more rabbits than they could carry.

After this people believed in him. He foretold the rains and snows, and
promised good weather for the coming season. They asked him to be
cacique, but he said he was not born for that. He instituted customs of
the hunt and of warfare.

He prophesied the coming of the Whites and the disappearance of game
animals ([p. 62](tci035.htm#page_62).md).

### MONTEZUMA

(2 versions: *a* Dumarest, p. 228; *b*, Benedict, Informant 4, [p.
191](tci113.htm#page_191)..md)

Dumarest's account of Montezuma is of a thoroughly mythological culture
hero, and it contrasts strongly with version *b*, which is a very
characteristic Cochiti historical tale, telling of his designation of
Watumasi as chief of Azteco pueblo, and of his conflict with Nankortez
for Tuskala. It agrees with Dumarest's much more mythological version of
Montezuma, however, in stressing the golden age during his rule, his
going away and his promise to return. He dressed himself and the
Malinche, his female partner, as for a dance, and they entered a lake
together. In his final speech he foretold the coming of the Whites, and
promised to come again when there were many Whites in the country, *b*.

Dumarest's account agrees with all Cochiti hero stories in the picture
of the hero as ridiculed, but Montezuma is ridiculed as a half-wit, and
noodle stories are told of him:

His mother, a dirty orphan girl, was made pregnant by a piñon nut. The
child walked In four days. He had no one to teach him of hunting but he
made a bow and arrow for himself, and made a nuisance of himself asking
questions. They told him to shoot a rabbit, and he shot the man digging
out a rabbit from his burrow. He overcame his mockers by bringing in
many rabbits, and by magically attracting game by playing his flute from
the roof of his house.

He was accepted as a supernatural, and was paraded like a santu, while
the people prostrated themselves. He assigned the places where all his
people were to live. His food was the food of supernaturals, corn pollen
and wild honey; when he fed his followers with it it was inexhaustible.
His bowl

he had only to lift to the sky, also, in order to have it fill with
water. His Malinche gave a woman in return for her hospitality a roll of
wafer bread, and when she unrolled it it had become gold.

The only culture hero incident that is assigned to Montezuma in
instituting the customs, is, significantly enough, that of "reforming
the unmarried mothers," i. e., he is associated with the Catholic
enforcement of marriage. He made a winged fish to frighten them, but it
devoured them, so Montezuma confined it in a lake.

He was put in prison by the Spaniards, but a stone from one of his own
people killed him. He had told them he would return and deliver them.
They were to offer ground shell to him every morning toward the east at
sunrise, for that was the direction from which he would return.
