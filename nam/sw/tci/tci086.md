### COYOTE HAS A BALL ON HER TOE <span id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_168)

Coyote had many children, and they were thirsty. She said to them, "Poor
children, wait a little. I will hurry and get water for you." She ran
off. When she got, to the river, she drank a lot and took water in her
mouth for her children.

She saw somebody in the road. He called out,

There goes the Coyote;  
Got a ball on her toe.

\[paragraph continues\] Coyote screamed and opened her mouth, and all
the water was spilled. She went back to the river for more water, and
took it in her mouth. She ran back. Again she saw somebody in the road.
He called out,

There goes the Coyote;  
Got a ball on her toe.

\[paragraph continues\] Coyote screamed and opened her mouth and all the
water was spilled. "What shall I do?" she cried," My poor children are
dying of thirst. How shall I fix it so I won't spill the water?" She
went back to the river and took more water. She drank lots. Her stomach
was round with water. She ran back. She burst. So her children didn't
get water after all.
