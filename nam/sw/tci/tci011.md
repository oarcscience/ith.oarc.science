### HELUTA AND NYENYEGA CONTEST FOR A WIFE <span id="fr_18"></span>[5](#fn_18)

Heluta, <span id="fr_19"></span>[12](#fn_19) the father of the katcinas,
and N<sup>y</sup>en<sup>y</sup>ega, <span id="fr_20"></span>[13](#fn_20)
contested as to which should marry Yellow Woman. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[14](#fn_21) Yellow Woman "ground" at the dance (i.
e., she rubbed the notched stick with the deer's scapula, resting it on
an inverted dried pumpkin). Heluta and N<sup>y</sup>en<sup>y</sup>ega
watched her all the, time, and they thought she was very beautiful. They
fell to fighting for her. They fought and fought. The koshare said,
"What is the use of fighting for Yellow Woman? Go out hunting, both of
you, and whoever kills a deer without wounding it shall marry her." Next
day Heluta and N<sup>y</sup>en<sup>y</sup>ega went out to hunt. Yellow
Woman said, "Whoever kills a deer with out a wound and brings it to me
first, I shall marry him." Heluta did not find a deer, but Nyenyega
killed his and brought it in unskinned without a wound. So
N<sup>y</sup>en<sup>y</sup>ega married Yellow Woman.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[9:12](tci011.htm#fr_19) Heluta is often equated
with Ganadjani. See pp. [60](tci034.htm#page_60)-62,
[251](tci129.htm#page_251). He comes in first in any line of masked
dancers. His mask is black with white zigzag stripes and he wears a
buckskin, and spruce around his neck.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[9:13](tci011.htm#fr_20)
N<sup>y</sup>en<sup>y</sup>ega is father of the curdzi and is considered
one of the most beautiful of the katcinas. He wears a white shirt and a
whole buckskin. His mask is green, with two lines slanting downward and
outward on the forehead. He wears downy feathers on the top of the head
and carries thin switches.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[9:14](tci011.htm#fr_21) Yellow Woman is the
stock female katcina, as she is the stock heroine of folklore. Her mask
is green and she wears her hair done in the large characteristic knobs
at the Hopi of the unmarried maiden. She wears as a dress the
embroidered ceremonial blanket and an all-white manta over her
shoulders.
