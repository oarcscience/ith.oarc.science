### THE MAN WHO FAILED TO BECOME A WITCH <span id="fr_120"></span>[26](#fn_119.md)

A witch was herding the sheep of a man of Bernadillo. A Cochiti herdsman
asked for employment of the same sheep owner and was

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

accepted. He went to the sheep country and met the man who was a witch.
They herded together. They became acquainted and they told each other
stories. The witch told many wonderful stories of the things that had
happened to him. The other said, "I wish I could meet somebody who would
tell me how to make these things happen to me." The witch said, "If you
really want to find out, I will look for a witch. I will tell them to
teach you." Again he asked the other, "Are you sure you really want to
meet a witch?" "Yes." Finally the witch said, "I will go back to town
and look for a witch." Before he left he said again, "Are you sure you
want to be a witch? You would have all your wishes fulfilled. You would
always get every animal you hunted, every girl you desired, everything."
He said, "I want to be a witch."

The witch came from the sheep country back to his own town, and went
back again to the plains. He met his partner. He said, "I saw the witch
headman, but he turned his power over to me. He told me everything I
needed to know. I can tell you." He explained everything. At last he
said, "I, too, am a witch. If you still wish to be a witch by Friday,
come on that. day, for that is the only day witches meet." On Friday
evening the witch said, "Are you ready?" "Yes; I'm willing if there is
no danger. Shall we run any risks about our flock of sheep?" "No; we
shall come right back. The flock will stand still all night." At dark
the witch knelt on the ground. "Put your hands on my shoulder," he said.
"Shut your eyes and don't open them until you're told." He knelt by the
hearth. The other put his hands on his shoulders and shut his eyes. Off
they went. The other didn't know how they went; he did not open his
eyes. Soon it sounded to him as if he had landed, but he was told they
were going south to old Mexico. When they landed the witch said, "Are
you willing to do as you are told?" "Yes." "You will not have great
possessions of money and merchandise, but you will always have your
wish." "Yes; I am willing." "We are here close by the door." They moved
east a little way and a door opened in a bare open place and showed a
great room inside. There were people talking and laughing there. The
witch said, "When we go in, don't be afraid. Sit beside me. All the
different peoples will be there: Mexicans, Indians, Navahos, Apaches,
Comanches, Americans. Many animals will come out, whatever they were
made witches by."

They went in. The table was set for a feast. People went back and forth
setting out food, everything boiling hot. Again the witch said, "Don't
be afraid. Everything is free to you." They took knives and forks and
spoons and began to eat. When the man took

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

a piece of meat on his fork, it was a baby's finger. He held it up; he
nudged his partner. The witch said, "It is boiled already. It's not
dangerous. Eat it." He ate it but he felt sick. After they finished, the
tables were cleared. The outsider remembered about his flock. "Christ!
Our flock will get scattered." "I told you not to think of your flock. I
explained everything to you before we started out and now you name
Christ. Is it that you want to back out?" "No." "You know I explained
everything." "I will keep my promise."

A handsome man came out into the room; he had a fine moustache and on
his forehead you thought you saw some horns. He said, "There is an
outsider here. If he wants to become one of us he shall have his
wishes." He went back. Next a handsome woman came out, she had pretty
hair, fine clothes. She said, "There is an outsider here. If he wants to
become one of us he shall have his wishes." The next one who came out
was an ugly man with a big head and belly and little legs. The witch
said, "But the next will be uglier yet. Don't be afraid even if he
crawls all over you." The next was a great serpent that went crawling
all around the room and when he came to the outsider he curled ready to
strike at him. "Don't get scared," said the witch. The serpent crawled
over his legs. Again the witch said, "Don't get scared." The serpent
went away. Next came a he goat. He went around the room and smelled of
each person. The outsider had an odor different from the rest. The goat
got on his hind legs and tried to buck the man. "Don't get scared," the
witch said. Again he bucked him, and again the witch said, "Don't get
scared." The goat went away. The goat was the last.

When everything was over and the witches were saying goodbye the man who
was being initiated said goodbye also and went out. His friend missed
him and asked for him. He, went out and found him. He knelt and the
other put his hands on his shoulders, he shut his eyes and they flew
off. As they were getting near home, the man who was not yet a witch
remembered again. "For Christ's sake, hurry so that we will get home
before our flock is stolen." As he said the name of Christ the witch
threw him off and left him on the plains.

He picked himself up all alone and started to walk back. It was a long
distance and there were no towns there then. He was very hungry and
thirsty. It was east of Sandia. At last in six or eight days he got to
camp. He found his partner there but the witch did not greet him because
he had not done what he promised. The other decided to go back home; he
was feeling bad. Soon after

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

he got home, he died. He told the people, "I die because I promised to
become a witch but did not keep my promise." That man died here in
Cochiti.
