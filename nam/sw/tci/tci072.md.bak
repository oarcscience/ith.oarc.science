### THE MOTHER WHO MOURNED FOR HER DAUGHTER <span id="fr_146"></span>[17](#fn_145.md)

A mother had two daughters. One died, and she was left with only one.
This girl grew many years, but she became sick. She gave her medicines
and she called the medicine men to cure her, but she died. The father
said, "I shall guard her four nights at the church." For four nights he
stayed there, but nothing happened to the grave. The mother wept all the
time and never forgot her daughter. She said she could never forget her.
They had many dances in the village and her husband would come to take
her to see them, but she would not go. She stayed in the house and cried
all day. She did not take care of herself at all. She did not wash her
hair, nor cut her bangs, and they grew till they hung down to her chin.

Her daughter had not gone to the place where all Indians go when they
die because her mother was always weeping for her. The chief of the
other world said, "Why can't this girl enter this place where we all
are?" He chose two messengers to take her back to her mother. They were
not to go to the village, but they were to let her mother know how she
troubled her in the other world. They were to teach her that she should
forget and not remember her daughter any more. The chief gave the girl
over to the two messengers and he said, "Take hold of her body." The
girl's bangs hung down to

her chin and her face was dirty and covered with mucus. All the mucus
her mother blew from her nose when she wept she blew onto her daughter's
face, and when her mother no longer cut her bangs the daughter's bangs
grew too. The two were told, "When you get to the next world you will
find the mother is not sleeping. She will be awake and crying. Go to her
and touch her with your finger." They went to the house and found the
mother just as they had said they should find her. They said to her,
"Are you sleeping?" "No." "Get up and look at your daughter. Maybe you
don't love your daughter, for because of you she can not enter the place
where we Indians all go. But if you love your daughter with all your
heart, wash your body and cut your hair before daybreak. You will be
washing your own daughter." They brought her up to see her daughter. She
tried to go to her and embrace her, but she could not. She cried as hard
as she could. Then she said, "I will do as you say, for I love my
daughter with all my heart." She woke her husband and told him she was
to wash herself. When her hair was dry, she told him to cut her bangs as
she used to wear them.

When she had finished everything she was to be taken to the next world
to see her daughter again. They came and told her, "Hurry up." The
people in the village began to grind for her (i. e., they thought she
had died). As the two took her along, on each side of the road there
were many flowers. The chief saw her coming and said, "She is coming."
Then he said to the mother, "We called you to see your daughter. You
know how much trouble she had when you were crying for her, but now she
is with us all. Keep your eyes open to see the people in this world."
She went on farther. She saw them bringing two girls, and they were the
two sisters (i. e., her two daughters). Here was her daughter who had
died last all dressed and cleaned, because her mother had washed
herself.

The two (messengers) hurried to bring her back, for the people in the
village were digging her grave. As they started back, the chief said,
"Don't be afraid of your own body." He said to the two, "Her body will
be all wrapped up. Throw her on top of it and it will be alive again."
They threw her on top of it, and she said, "Oh, what a terrible body
this is!" She got up, all tied up as the body was. When she was alive
again she told the people what had happened to her.
