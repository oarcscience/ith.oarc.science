### THE HUSBAND WHO WAS A WITCH <span id="fr_115"></span>[9](#fn_114.md)

Long ago there were two sisters. The elder sister was married, and the
younger sister used to go to grind with a friend who lived close by.
They would grind at night and sing love songs. The younger sister
noticed that there was something the matter with her brother-in-law. One
day her sister was sick and she felt sorry to go and grind that night
and leave her sister. She took her basket of blue corn and went up the
ladder and down to the street. She said, "This time I will watch my
brother-in-law, see where he goes and all that he does." She stood in a
corner by a wood pile and rested her basket on the top. She saw her
brother come up the ladder and go out. She followed at a distance.

At last he came to a high bank. She saw a light coming from a hole
inside. Her brother went in. She stood outside and peeped in through a
little window, listening. The room inside was full of witch people. She
heard one of the women say to her brother, "Why do you come in so late?"
"Because my sister-in-law stayed so long. I couldn't come till she
left." "How is your wife?" "She is a little sick." "You must not care
for your wife, care for me instead. Take this root and put it under her
pillow before her sister comes home. This will make her worse." When she
heard this, the sister took her corn to the house where she was
accustomed to grind. She ground all night.

The husband took the root and went home. He put it under his wife's
pillow. Early in the morning the sister got up and went up the ladder to
her sister's. She set to work to get breakfast and sweep the house. When
she was sweeping she moved her sister's pallet to one side and took up
her pillow. She saw the root. She knew what it was there for. She seized
it and threw it into the fire. Her brother-in-law sat with his head
bowed. His wife began to feel better.

Night came, and the sister went out with a basket of blue corn and stood
in the same place. Her brother-in-law came out and went

to the high bank. She followed him. She stood outside and listened
again. The woman said to her brother-in-law, "How is your wife?" "She is
better to-night." "What became of the root?" "My sister-in-law found it
and threw it into the fire. This made my wife better." "All right, I
will give you the strongest medicine. Hide it from your sister-in-law."
But the sister-in-law was listening. As soon as she heard this she
hurried home and went to grind with her friend, and they were singing
grinding songs and laughing. Her friend knew nothing about her visit to
the high bank. When she was through she took the basket of meal, and
went up the ladder and down into her sister's house. "Good morning,
sister," she said, "how do you feel?" "A little better." She started
breakfast and swept. She raised her sister, and moved the pillow. She
found a big root there, and she threw it into the fire. The sister got
up and began to work. Her husband sat with bowed head to see his wife
get up! They ate their morning meal.

That night, as soon as the husband left, the sister-in-law went to grind
her corn. She stopped by the wood pile and followed her brother-in-law
to the high bank. She stopped and listened. The witch woman said, "Here
comes the boy, you are always late! What were you doing? I think you
care more for your wife than you do for me. How is she?" "She is much
better; she is up." "Is that so? What became of the root?" "My
sister-in-law found it and threw it into the fire." "Next time I will be
a great bear. I will come after her and kill her. To-morrow there will
be a dance at the next pueblo. Tell her to dress herself and go with you
there. Do not take her sister. On the way, where the road goes along the
river, I will come out of the bushes and rush upon you and kill her."
The sister heard. She went home before the meeting was over and climbed
the ladder to her sister's house. She took sacred meal and went farther
west and offered it to the six directions and prayed to the katcinas.
She prayed hard. She asked the katcina for a stronger medicine than the
witch woman had. When she had prayed the katcina came. They brought her
the magic crystal and gave it to her, saying, "No matter if your brother
does not want you to go, go. When the bear woman comes after you, throw
this crystal at her; she will run on your sister's husband and hug him
and they will roll and roll together until he is dead." She set off to
her sister's. "Don't worry any more," she told her. "Your husband will.
be the first to die, not you and I."

In the morning the husband said to his wife, "Dress in your best
costume. I shall take you to the other pueblo where they will dance
to-day." She said to her sister, "Dress, and we will go together." The
husband said, "No; she is to stay." But his wife insisted that

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

her sister go with her. The sister dressed herself, and went with her
sister and brother-in-law. They came to the river. The bear came out and
chased them. The sister had the magic crystal which the katcina had
given her. When the bear came, she threw it at him. He ran at her
brother-in-law and hugged him. They rolled and rolled until he was dead.
The bear was dead, too. So the husband and the witch woman were killed,
and the sisters returned safely to their pueblo and lived there.
