### THE PUNISHMENT OF THE SNAKE SOCIETY <span id="fr_36"></span>[5](#fn_36.md)

They were living in Sia. The Snake medicine men and women, before their
ceremony, fasted for four days. Afterwards any one who had fasted with
his whole heart was able to catch a living snake and bring it to the
ceremonial room. On the third day of the fast all the people in Sia were
baking and cooking for the feast of the fourth day. The men and women of
the Snake Society had gathered the snakes they had caught and put them
in great ollas in their ceremonial cave. The women gathered ikia (a
red-flowering cactus with large flattened spines) and they ground them
into flour and

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

put in water and drank it. They boiled the spines also and ate those. It
was all they ate during their fast.

When the days of fasting were over they were very weak. They went into
retreat in their own ceremonial room. On the fourth night all the people
in Sia, came to the room of the Snake Society, and they danced before
the altar. Four men stood in front of the altar and each held a snake.
They danced, and the snakes curled around their necks and waists. When
the dancing was over the people brought in the feast. All the people of
Sia brought in baskets and set them on both sides of the road <span
id="fr_37"></span>[20](#fn_37.md) that led to the altar. The chief medicine
man took a pinch from each basket and offered to the dead. Before they
ate, they took the snakes back to the mountains. They ate and the chief
medicine man said, "The ceremony is over. Now everyone can do as he
pleases. You must all sleep here and no one must go out of the house."
All the men and women stayed together that night in the house of the
Snake Society. They slept with each other. They had intercourse with
each other in their ceremonial room. In the morning they had all turned
into stone. They are still to be seen in Sia.
