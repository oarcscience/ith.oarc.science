### THE DEER DANCE <span id="fr_40"></span>[21](#fn_40.md)

The people of Cochiti were living on the mesa. At Jemez they had a deer
dance (heemishikia). The dancers turned into deer and ran up into the
mountains. They never came back anymore. For four days they made
ceremonies in Jemez to bring them back, but they could not.
