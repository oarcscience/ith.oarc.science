### THE EAGLE AND THE BABY <span id="fr_130"></span>[17](#fn_129.md)

A man and woman were married. Their goats increased. The man said to his
wife, "Shall we move out of the pueblo so that we can care for a bigger
herd of goats?" She agreed and they moved out to the east, along the
river. After lambing time they put the little kids in their corral, and
their son drove the mothers out to pasture on the mountain close by.
While the family were busy in the house and the kids were playing alone
in the corral, there was a noise. They ran out and saw that an eagle had
taken a kid and had flown away with it. So the eagle carried off the
kid. When they had forgotten about this, one day the mother missed the
baby. He had crept out of the house. The eagle was hungry for meat and
he saw the baby. He flew down and caught him in his claws. The mother
heard a noise. She had not missed the child but she saw him in the
eagle's claws high up in the air. The mother watched which way the eagle
was flying, and followed running until she saw where he had gone. Then
she returned. She called her husband to rouse the pueblo, and the people
gave chase in the direction that the eagle had taken. They discovered
the nest and heard the baby crying. The nest was on a ledge on the cliff
high up. The husband made proclamation that he would pay anything he
asked to anyone who brought the baby down. They had brought a long rope
of soap-weed fiber and they promised the father of the baby that the
next day they would climb to the top of the cliff and swing the rope to
the ledge if the baby was alive. Early before sunrise the parents of the
baby came to the top of the cliff; they could hear the baby still
crying. All night they had not slept; they had prayed our Mother that
they might get the baby down alive or dead. The people got there. They
tied one man with the rope around the legs and waist and made a kind of
basket to support him. They could hear the baby still crying. They
stationed men along the cliff's edge to chase the eagles away with
sticks if they returned while they were robbing the nest. The mother was
crying that they might get the baby back alive. The man that they had
let down over the face of the cliff got near and saw the baby playing in
the nest; he had not been hurt or scratched. This is

the way the baby was recovered. He gave him to the mother. The parents
were very happy, and they sold their goats and returned to the pueblo
where they would be safe. The man who rescued the baby would not take
any payment.

The baby grew up and became a great man. He discovered many gold mines
and things that brought wealth to his people. Whenever he found a gold
mine, he turned it all over to the pueblo to be carried to the
treasuries of Mexico and given to Montezuma and his family. Therefore
Mexico used to have much gold, because it was taken to them from these
mines.
