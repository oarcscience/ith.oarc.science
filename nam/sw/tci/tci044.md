### LOCUST BOY <span id="fr_100"></span>[17](tci045.htm#fn_100)

There was a daughter of a cacique who did not want to marry. The young
men brought moccasins, belts and mantas, but she did not want them.
Every night the young men met to make plans to win her, but they could
not. They told Biliiwai'ya (locust? "bald-headed ugly little underground
bug"), "It is your turn to ask the girl to marry you." He said, "What is
the use of my going? You look so much better; I'm bald."

But he went to the girl's house to try to get her to marry him. He made
a wig and cut the bangs like an Indian's, so that he would look nice.
Now he was a handsome boy. The boys were all laughing to see him go to
ask the girl to marry him.

She got up, for she liked this boy and thought that he was handsome. She
married him. Every night he went to her house and slept with her. When
she was sound asleep he would take his wig off. At last one night his
wife woke up. She looked at her husband. He was bald and the wig was
lying by his side. She was horrified, he was so ugly. She thought, "What
kind of husband I have!" She went off up the ladder. He heard his wife
go out and he ran after her. He was ashamed of his baldness.

The girl was pregnant and when her children were born they were like
locusts; there were six of them. That is how she was punished because
she was not willing to marry.
