### THE PECOS INDIANS BECOME SNAKES <span id="fr_38"></span>[5](#fn_38.md)

They were living in Pecos. They fought and many were killed. Half the
people left Pecos and came down in this direction. The other half stayed
behind. Those who stayed had a meeting. They planned to become snakes.
Those who had already started in this direction wondered why the rest
did not come to join them. They sent a messenger, a goatcini, <span
id="fr_39"></span>[20a](#fn_39.md) to see what was the matter. He found
they had all become snakes. He returned and told them, "They have all
turned themselves into snakes. I do not know what has happened." The
women cried and cried. One of the chief men said, "How can we let this
happen without doing anything? We have a medicine society. We will call
the puyatc." They called together all the puyatc and they set up their
altar and prayed and sang. They held their ceremony trying to restore
the snakes. The women brought in pollen to feed to them. The medicine
men tied feathers and hung them around the necks of the snakes praying
that they should take the form of men and women again. For four days
they prayed and sang, but they could not restore the snakes. They let
them go and the rest of the Pecos Indians came down to Santo Domingo.
All the Pecos Indians who are left live in Santo Domingo and they still
have the Puyatc Society.
