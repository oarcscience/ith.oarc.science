### THE CACIQUE WHO VISITED THE DEAD <span id="fr_144"></span>[17](#fn_143.md)

At Cochiti the acting cacique died and two messengers were sent from our
Mother to bring him to Shipap. He was a member of the Flint Society but
the seeds had not been planted in him so that he had not yet been
installed in the cacique's office.

The two messengers brought him along the road. In the other world they
were waiting for the cacique. The messengers called out, "A man is
coming." From inside the house they answered, "Welcome, you are needed
here. It is not yet time for you to die, for the seeds are not yet in
you for the cacique's office." They showed him an open place where he
was to sit. While he was there, our Mother told him those things he
ought to know, and how to take care of his people. One of the two
messengers was impatient, and interrupted, "Are you not yet through
telling him all you have to say?" Toward evening the two who went after
his soul looked back to the place where his body was lying, and they saw
that the people were preparing to bury him. He was lying ready for the
burial. Everything he needed to know he was told in this place (in
Shipap), and they sent him back hurriedly to the place where his body
lay.

As they went along the road they came to a high steep bank. They told
the cacique, "Look up, you will see a person standing on the top of the
cliff. That person, when he was alive in this world was a bad man, so
the war chief placed him in this place to dry up forever at his post."
On each side were others, the threads of whose lives were cut off short
before their time. They were always taken good care of till it was time
for them to go on to live with the rest (in the other world, i.e.,
Shipap). The two said to the cacique, "Look to the south, do you see a
woman coming with a skeleton in her arms? She is punished because she
did not like her husband in this world. <span
id="fr_145"></span>[32](#fn_144.md) Beyond her do you see people walking in
pairs? These are the ones who lived a happy married life and had no
trouble in this world. They have been reunited and are going arm in arm
to the other world to be happy." So they showed him everything that
comes to pass in the other world, that he might tell his people when he
returned. When they had gone farther, they saw different people--men and
women sitting in their seats of punishment. There were lions and wild
animals chained so near them they could only take one step to turn
around. All their food was a spider or a lizard that by good fortune
came within their reach.

They hurried along the road, for already the people had rolled him in
his robes for burial. They got back to the place were his body was
lying. The two took him up the ladder. They took him into the room. The
soul of the cacique saw his body lying on the floor with all the people
gathered about mourning for him. The two who brought him told his soul
to go back into the body. But the soul was afraid of his body lying on
the floor and the two tried to persuade him. At last they pushed him
violently and the soul fell back into the body. He opened his mouth and
spoke. The people were startled. They welcomed him. The two disappeared
and the cacique did not know where they had gone. The people took off
the body everything that had been put on him for his burial. He told the
people all that he had seen on his journey and where he had gone during
these few hours that his body had been dead. So the cacique who came
back to life gave the people all that he had been told and he cared for
them, and in this way he was installed as the cacique of the pueblo. He
lived a long time and became very old. Death would not come to him (i.
e., easily) a second time.
