### ARROW BOY TRIUMPHS OVER HIS MOCKERS <span id="fr_57"></span>[11](#fn_57.md)

In Cochiti the cacique had an only boy ("grandson probably"). He never
went out. He didn't know the country, nor how to hunt. He only knew bow
to sing. The other young men were jealous because he had so many lovers,
because he always stayed in the pueblo and wore good clothes and sang to
the girls. At last the young men who were hunters decided to put it
before Masewa. They said, "Let us hunt deer and put the cacique's boy in
charge and see where he will lead us." Masewa listened to them and
agreed to their plan. They were to put the boy in command of the party
to find out how he would manage, and where he would take them. They sent
for Arrow Boy to go to Masewa, and when he came, Masewa told him that he
had chosen him to, take charge of the deer hunt and he must choose the
direction in which they should go; he was the one to decide.

Arrow Boy accepted gladly; he did not know they were mocking him. He
said, "All right, Masewa. Tell the boys to make all their preparations
and have bows and arrows ready. In four days I will decide which
direction we shall take. I will ask our Mother to choose the place and
arrange the hunt."

For four days he asked our Mother that the hunt should be successful;
that there should be no trouble with the men and no trouble with the
game; that he should manage his party well. For four nights the other
young men met together and laughed about how Arrow Boy would manage his
hunting party. They said, "He will

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

get over singing to the girls around the village; he'll see he has to be
a man."

The day came when they were to go. Arrow Boy dressed himself for the
hunt. He came out and made proclamation (in three places) to notify the
hunters that it was time to start for the hunt. He told them to go to
the north. He would be waiting for them there. He went to Masewa to ask
for his guard. Masewa gave him his guard and they went ahead of the
others, to the north. When they got to the meeting place he had
appointed, they waited for the hunters. In a little while the others
arrived and he led them farther to the north. He selected the mouth of a
canyon in which to pitch their camp for the night. Early in the morning
Arrow Boy rose and told the rest to pack up their loads and go farther
into the canyon. There he would assign their stations for the hunt.

When they came to the place he had appointed he stood before them all
and said, "Masewa has given authority into my hands for these days.
Everybody shall carry out every direction. If we work together, our
Mother will help us for I have asked her that she should give much game
during these days to feed her people." When he had finished he separated
the hunters into two parties. He put leaders in charge of each party and
assigned to the men their positions. The two parties followed opposite
sides of the canyon and when they came together, they drove game
directly toward Arrow Boy and his guard who stood waiting at the
starting place. When everything was ready Arrow Boy said to his guard,
"Deer are coming and whether they want to or not, they must come through
this pass. Shoot as many as you can; some will fall right here, others
you will wound and will have to follow until they fall." Those of his
guard who were against him said, "He thinks he knows, and he has never
hunted before!" Those who were for him said, "He has supernatural
power."

When the two parties came together, they started toward the boy and his
guard. At first they started mountain goats, but farther on, herds of
deer. At every trail out of the canyon they had stationed men so that no
game could escape. The animals tried to get out but these men who were
guarding the trails turned them back, killing a few. All kinds of game
were running together now and they drew close to where Arrow Boy and his
guard were. Near an opening of the canyon they started wild turkeys and
quails (in olden times quails flew only once). The game went straight to
where Arrow Boy and the old hunters (his guard) were standing. Ahead
came the turkeys; the deer and the mountain goats hugged the sides of
the canyon. They had a good day and they got much game; very few
escaped. The hunters from up the canyon pressed close upon the game and
made them go through the narrow pass

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

of the canyon. The mountain goats went first. The guard killed them. All
the deer followed and they killed those. Where there were trails out of
the canyon there the hunters had killed, too. They had plenty of game.
The hunters who had mocked the boy got nothing, the old hunters who had
had faith in him killed many, and Arrow Boy killed most of all. When
they had gathered together all the game those who had mocked him hid
away and went home by another direction. The rest of the hunters came
into the pueblo with their game and divided it according to
custom. <span id="fr_58"></span>[12](#fn_58.md)

The people of the pueblo talked about the hunt. They mocked those who
had mocked Arrow Boy. People said it was not right to make fun of him.
They praised him and he was set aside by his grandfather to be initiated
into the Flint Society. <span id="fr_59"></span>[13](#fn_59.md) From that
time on he always brought good counsels to his people and he grew
continually in power. When his grandfather died, he became cacique. This
is what the mockers planned against Arrow Boy.

[p. 216](tci124.htm#page_216). Cp. [p. 62](tci035.htm#page_62.md), where
the same incident is told by the same informant of Corncob Boy's success
in a rabbit hunt.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[45:12](tci029.htm#fr_58.md) When several hunters
are hunting together, the one whose arrow kills the deer has the right
to the hide and the body of the animal; the one who has touched the deer
first receives the left hind leg, the second the right hind leg, the
third the left fore leg, the fourth the right foreleg, and the fifth
only a small cut of meat.

When two are out together, the one whose arrow kills the deer receives
the hide and body of the animal and the left fore and hind legs; the
other, the right fore and hind legs.
