### COYOTE INTERRUPTS THE CORN DANCE <span id="fr_161"></span>[3](#fn_160.md)

They were living in Ushuk (old site of Cochiti, south). One day the
parrots said, "Shall we have a corn dance?" "All right. Go and get the
prairie dogs to come." They went to the kiva and

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

began to sing and practice for the corn dance. Next morning they called
the prairie dog girls. All the, prairie dogs brought their dance clothes
and went into the kiva. The parrots took the corn dance standard
(*paĕtiam*, a pole topped with a ball and dressed with parrot-tail
feathers and a pendent fox skin) and they went out to the plaza to
dance.

Coyote heard that they were going to dance the corn dance and he came
and joined the crowd. He said, "I'm hungry. Perhaps I could kill one of
the corn dancers." He took a stick and hid it under his tail, and he
said to the prairie dogs, "I'd like to dance too." "All right. You may
dance at the end of the line." But the prairie dogs saw the stick that
Coyote had under his tail. They sang,

Lookout! Lookout!  
Coyote has a stick hidden under his tail.  
Lookout! Lookout!

\[paragraph continues\] They all ran into their holes. Coyote ran and
tried to strike them with his stick but they had all disappeared. He
said, "I'll get these prairie dogs just the same!" and he dug and dug at
their holes till he was all dusty and his tongue hung out, but he did
not get one prairie dog.
