# IV. ANIMAL TALES

## COYOTE

The great character in all Southwest animal tales is, of course, Coyote.
In Cochiti his character is unusually consistent and no tales are
recorded that clash with it. <span id="fr_225"></span>[1](#fn_223.md) He is
an ill-omened cheat, imitator, and fool, never the clever inventor nor
culture hero with magic power. This concept is so strong that even the
Cochiti analogues of Hoodwinked Dancers can be identified only by the
line of the song: "Coyote is going to hit you on the back," and the tale
is only of a decrepit Grandfather Coyote singing to his drum over and
over to the delight of the prairie dogs ([p. 144](tci078.htm#page_144).md).
When in Cochiti they do tell of Coyote's murderous intent at a dance of
prairie dogs, they tell how the prairie dogs taunted him and escaped
into their holes. He dug till his tongue hung out, but he did not get
one ([p. 144](tci078.htm#page_144).md).

The tale of how the prey animals fasted for their power, given under the
Origin Tales, is consistent with this character of Coyote:

The other animals carried out their fast and were blest, but Coyote
cheated by drinking water and sacred meal on the third day and his
punishment was to get his food with difficulty forever ([p.
8](tci009.htm#page_8).md).

The same punishment is elsewhere visited upon Coyote for opening the jar
of stars that had been entrusted to him by Our Mother ([p.
4](tci005.htm#page_4).md).

### COYOTE BRINGS HER CHILDREN TO PLAY WITH QUAILS

Quail brought her children to play just above Whirlpool Place. She sang
while they danced. Coyote came along and wanted her children to play
with the young quails. Quail sang for them. Coyote noticed that her
children had no topknots, and was told, by Quail that she had put sticks
in her children's heads to make them. Coyote tried to do likewise,
hammering sticks into her children's heads. Thus she killed them, and
Quail and her children ran off. ([p. 145](tci080.htm#page_145).md).

### BUNGLING HOST

Coyote and Rattlesnake lived at Gamatsika. They planned to invite each
other to a great feast. Coyote, invited Rattlesnake first, and prepared
paper bread and meat for them, killing a sheep for the occasion. She
called her guest who came in and coiled himself on the floor, but he did
not care for the feast because he only ate sacred meal and pollen. When
Rattlesnakes turn came,

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

he thought of what Coyote might like and went out and killed two
chickens. Coyote, wishing to imitate the snake, tied a gourd rattle on
his tall, but found this too heavy and replaced it with corn husks. He
came in to Rattlesnake's and turned around as his guest had done, and
tried to make a noise with his tall. Because his guest had refused his
feast, he too refused. Rattlesnake was angry and ran at him, for he
thought he was being mocked, and Coyote had to escape. So he lost the
chickens (p. 146).

For Bungling Host, see also introduction to "Bear and Deer" tale (pp.
[160](tci097.htm#page_160), [161](tci098.htm#page_161.md), notes, [p.
243](#page_243).md).

### FOX FOOLS COYOTE WITH THE MOON AND MAKES HER THINK IT CHEESE

There were many foxes and coyotes living at White Bank. Fox was invited
by Coyote to race him to a big pond. Fox saw the full moon in the pond
and told Coyote that somebody there had a big piece of cheese. Fox
suggested that they drink the pond up in order to get the cheese. They
took turns, Fox pretending to drink, and Coyote drinking. When Coyote
was nearly exhausted, Fox said that he would get the cheese, put it out
on a stone, and they would both race for it. He pulled up a white stone
and carried It to the appointed place. But Coyote, when she began the
race, burst, and "got no cheese" ([p. 147](tci082.htm#page_147).md).

### VARIANT

Coyote was told that he should look into the water of a little stream.
When he did this he saw something which he was told was cheese, and it
was suggested that he jump in and get it. This he did and was drowned
([p. 148](tci083.htm#page_148).md).

### THE LITTLE COYOTES TRY TO BE DUCKS AND ARE DROWNED

At Whirlpool Place a duck lived with her ducklings. She sang for them to
jump into the river. Coyote heard her and decided that her children
should do likewise. The young coyotes were afraid of the water. Duck
sang for them, but they would not jump. Coyote threw half of them into
the water and they were drowned. She cried so for her lost children that
she died ([p. 148](tci083.htm#page_148).md).

### COYOTE IMITATES CROW

There was a bank of paper bread of all colors, and at the foot of this
there was a pond of sweet corn milk. A crow was perched on the top of
this bank singing, and every time he sang, he bit off a piece of the
paper bread and flew down and drank of the sweet corn milk. Coyote came
along and tried to imitate him, but when he jumped from the bank, he was
drowned in the pond. Crow was glad for he wanted his eyes. Crow called
all the small animals to come to get his fur for their nests, and all
the birds who ate meat, to get his flesh. An old man came along with a
basket and picked up the bones for soup, and took them home to his wife
([p. 149](tci084.htm#page_149).md).

### BEAVER AND COYOTE

Old Man Coyote is the proverbial bad hunter in the fable "Coyote and
Beaver exchange wives" ([p. 136](tci073.htm#page_136.md), notes, [p.
236](tci125.htm#page_236).md).

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

### ROADRUNNER GIRLS GRIND

Roadrunner girls were grinding corn, and Coyote Woman wanted to grind
too. They told her to bring something to grind, and she brought hard
acorns and could not break them. Roadrunner girls made a precipice in
front of the door and excused themselves one by one. When Coyote Woman
went out she fell and was killed. Crow plucked her eyes out and called
all the little animals to get fur for their nests from the dead coyote.
There was nothing left but bones, and an old man took these home to his
wife to make soup of ([p. 149](tci084.htm#page_149).md).

### COYOTE TRIES TO BRING WATER TO HER CHILDREN

Coyote went to get water for her children and was bringing it back when
somebody called that she had a ball on her toe. She screamed and spilled
the water. This happened a second time. The third time she drank lots,
and while she was running back, she burst, and her children didn't get
any water after all ([p. 150](tci085.htm#page_150).md).

### CROW CUTS OUT COYOTE'S EYES

Crow went visiting a pueblo, bringing a song to make them happy. He took
his mother's dancing shells. Only Coyote came to hear him sling, and he
admired the bunch of shells. Crow told him he had made them out of his
own eyes, and offered to make some for Coyote. Crow directed him to find
an obsidian arrow point, and he cut out both his eyes. Crow flew away
and mocked Coyote. The blind Coyote ran about helplessly and died ([p.
151](tci086.htm#page_151).md).

### BURRO AND COYOTE

Three brothers who are herding sheep send their burro home for food.
Their father orders bread and corn, put in the saddle bags and the burro
starts on the return journey. On the way back he passes Coyote who, in
order to secure the food for her children, pretends to be lame and asks
Burro to help her to her near-by home. She takes almost all the food.
Burro becomes suspicious, throws her off, and discovers her ruse. The
three brothers whip Burro, and send him back to get Coyote, telling him
to turn his arse to the hole. Burro does this and Coyote is caught when
she tries to get the meat which she thinks she sees coming in at her
door. The little coyotes think she has caught a buffalo, Burro carries
her to the brothers who whip her, and send her home bleeding. The little
coyotes think she is meat and eat her, regardless of her protests ([p.
152](tci087.htm#page_152).md).

## OTHER ANIMAL TALES

The rest of the animal tales are of very mixed character.

### TWO ANIMALS PLAY HIDE AND SEEK

There is a light-hearted tale of the little snipe and the horned toad
who play hide and seek. When Toad hid, Snipe thought she had found a
flint arrow head when she stumbled over him. When Snipe hid, Toad
thought he had found an awl for his grandfather to make moccasins with
([p. 153](tci088.htm#page_153).md).

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

### BETTING EYES

Spider and Dung Beetle were playing, and they bet their eyes on the
game. Therefore Spider who won has four eyes and Beetle none ([p.
153](tci088.htm#page_153).md).

### SCARING CONTEST

Rabbit is the clever animal.

Bear and Rabbit bet their lives upon being able to scare each other.
Bear scared Rabbit, who was not frightened. When her turn came Rabbit
removed her skin, and Bear ran, pursued by Rabbit, who called to her aid
all the animals In the mountain that were hunting. Bear was killed.
Rabbit took the claws. giving the meat and skin to the rest. She made a
necklace of the claws, and went to get coals from the little bears, so
that she should have a chance to exhibit her prize. The little beam were
enraged, and set out to kill her. She escaped to the rocks. She fooled
the bears Into bringing her cactus and sage brush for her winter stores
by telling them that in this way they could reach her. They went home
disgusted ([p. 157](tci094.htm#page_157).md).

### HORNED TOAD SINGS IN BLACK BOY'S STOMACH

Black Boy was planting cotton. Horned Toad, who did not know cotton,
asked him what he was doing and was told, but did not seem to know what
he was doing. He said that he would ask four times and, If he were not
told, he would swallow him. Four times he asked, and four times received
the same answer. Black Boy swallowed Toad. Then he heard a song which
said "I am In your stomach, and eating your heart, liver, lungs, and
stomach." He became frightened and decided that he would go to the river
where he would find the hishtiani who could open him with his thunder
knife. He continued to hear the song, so he hurried to carry out his
plans. The hishtiani cut him open and released Toad, and then rubbed his
body and closed the wound. Black Boy got up and went home ([p.
156](tci092.htm#page_156).md).

### GEESE TALK THE SANTA ANA LANGUAGE

Two Santa Ana girls went to Haniashte to pick beans. The geese called to
them in their own language to come over and pick white beans. The girls
became frightened, and fearing that they might be dangerous they
returned home and told their mother, who warned them not to go again
([p. 158](tci095.htm#page_158).md).

### GEESE GO SHELL-GATHERING

The geese were gathering shells in a field. Their leader urged them to
hurry, and they had just flown off when the owner of the field came up.
He only got Crane, who had just come up ([p. 159](tci096.htm#page_159).md).

"BEAR AND DEER"

This widespread story <span id="fr_226"></span>[2](#fn_224.md) occurs in
Cochiti in an atypical form with an introduction of a bungling host
story. <span id="fr_227"></span>[3](#fn_225.md) It has been recorded three

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

times: *a*, Boas, p. 160; *b*, Benedict, informant 1, [p.
161](tci098.htm#page_161); *c*, Benedict, informant 3 (omitted.md).

Deer invited Coyote to her house and killed her two children to feed
her. She told Coyote to wash the bones in the river and the children
were alive again. Coyote imitated her and killed her children to feed
Deer. When her children did not come to life she pursued Deer and her
fawns. A beaver carried Coyote across the water. She came to a buck, who
gored her, *a*.

Version *b* differs slightly in the account of Coyote's pursuit. Beaver
took Coyote across the river but played with her in the boat and had
intercourse with her. Meantime the boat drifted two miles down the river
and delayed Coyote. She overtook Deer on La Bajada Hill, but they had
reached the buck, the father of the fawns, and he gored Coyote.

### THE ORIGIN OF THE CAT

A deer, bear, lynx, lion, and wildcat came from Painted Cave. They
decided that cats were needed so the lion was selected to get them. He
was placed in the center of the circle while the others smoked around
him. He sneezed twice, and a male and female cat came out from his
nostrils. He declared that they were to be considered as his offspring
and have his face, and that they were to be useful to people to protect
them from mice. The rest of the animals were to live in the mountains,
but these two cats were to live in Cochiti ([p.
154](tci090.htm#page_154).md).

### PROPERTY CONTEST OF WOODRAT AND MOUSE

Woodrat and Mouse challenged each other as to who had the larger store
of grain. Woodrat arranged to show Mouse her stores which were very
plentiful. The next night she was to inspect those of Mouse who lived
with a cruel lion whose property Mouse considered as her own. As they
were looking at the stores the cat discovered them. Mouse escaped, but
Woodrat was too big and was caught and eaten ([p.
155](tci091.htm#page_155).md).

Other animal tales are grouped as fables, among the novelistic tales
(pp. [135](tci073.htm#page_135)-142.md). These are stories that seem
somewhat explicitly human moralistic tales, a rather unusual Indian
development. (Notes, pp. [236](tci125.htm#page_236)-238..md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_223"></span>[239:1](tci126.htm#fr_225.md) Coyote as a human
character or a katcina who marries a virtuous girl who has scorned
proposals of marriage (pp. [83](tci043.htm#page_83.md),
[84](tci043.htm#page_84).md), or who is sent as a messenger to Our Mother
(Dumarest 215), is not to be confused with the character of Coyote in
the animal tales.
