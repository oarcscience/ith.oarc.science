### THE GIRL WHO STEPPED ON THE SNAKE <span id="fr_139"></span>[10](#fn_138.md)

The People were living in Sacred Embroidered Manta Village. Powĭshka
girl lived there. A snake said to its mother, "I am going to have a
little walk." "I am afraid to have you go out, my child, for Powĭshka
might hurt you. She has hurt many snakes." "I'll be careful." "All
right." Snake went out. The mother kept looking out to see if it were
safe. Snake was gone a long time, and the mother thought, "Perhaps my
child was hurt."

Powĭshka girl said to her mother, "Mother, may I go to the fields? It
looks so nice in the fields." "I am afraid to have you go out, for you
might do some harm." "No, I won't; I'll just keep walking along the
road." "Be careful." She started out and met the snake. Snake said to
himself, "I am afraid; here comes Powĭshka." He got out of her way but
she had seen him. She picked up some stones and Snake began to cry. She
came near him and hit him with a stone. She didn't kill him, but she
left him hurt. "She has broken my back," thought Snake, "How can I get
home?" He began to sing--

Bowlegged Powĭshka girl,  
Powĭshka, Powĭshka girl;  
She kicked me, she broke my back,  
Hi! Hi! Hi! (Exclamation of distress.)

The mother was still watching. She heard her cry and thought, "I am
afraid. I think Powĭshka girl hurt my child. She. is crying that her
back is broken." She went to look for her child. On the way she heard
him singing--

Bowlegged Powĭshka girl,  
Powĭshka, Powĭshka girl;  
She kicked me, she broke my back,  
Hi! Hi! Hi!

When the mother got to the place where the snake was, she said, "You
paid no attention to what I told you. Powĭshka girl has hurt your back."
So the mother put her little snake on her back and went home. She said,
"I shall go and tell her mother about it. She never gives her daughter
advice." She went to the house of the girl's mother and told her that
her baby snake was hurt. She said to her, "You must tell your daughter
not to do that any more." The mother answered, "Why, she never pays any
attention to what I say." Powĭshka girl never came back to her house,
but that did not cure the little snake.

### VARIANT <span id="fr_140"></span>[17](#fn_139.md)

A snake was in the road. Powĭshka woman was travelling, and she stepped
on it. Snake cried, and sang--

"Crooked legs,  
Crooked legs,  
You stepped on me,  
You broke my back,  
Ai ya! Ai ya!"

She got home, her mother said, Why are you crying as you come along?
What happened to you? "Why shouldn't I cry? Powĭshka stepped on me."
"You don't watch when people are coming. That's why you get stepped on."
"But she just came along and stepped on me, that crooked legs!" "I've
told you not to go right in the road. People are always going along the
road." Powĭshka, said, "I didn't see her. She was lying in the road."
