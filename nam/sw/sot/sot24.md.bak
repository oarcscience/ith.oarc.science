##### LULLABY OF CANNIBAL GIANTS

Stop crying! Go to sleep, my little boy Primrose.  
That Saveyo Sendo will take you if you cry.  
Over there he will eat you, if you do not stop crying;  
Right now he will eat you, if you do not stop crying.  
That Saveyo Sendo in his bag he will put you.  
Stop crying! Go to sleep, my little boy Primrose.  
Over there he will take you, then I will be crying!  
Very thick now are the leaves of the cottonwood,  
Very thick now are the leaves of the willow,  
There he will take you in under the willow,  
That Saveyo Sendo whose teeth we all fear.  
Over there now, if you do not stop crying,  
Over there now, on the crest of the mountains,  
Those Saveyo walk and they hear every sound.  
And there in the mountains that one he will take you  
Where now they are taking the big boys and girls.
