<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*Savdlat*

The south, the south, oh the south yonder.  
When settling on the midland coast I met Pulangitsissok  
Who had grown stout and fat from eating halibut.  
Those people from the midland coast they don't know speaking,  
Because they are ashamed of their speech.  
Stupid they are besides.  
Their speech is not alike,  
Some speak like the northern, some like the southern;  
Therefore we can't make out their talk.

*Pulangitsissok*

There was a time when Savdlat wished that I should be a good kayaker,  
That I could take a good load on my kayak,  
Many years ago some day he wanted me to put a heavy load on my kayak  
(This happened at the time) when Savdlat had his kayak tied to mine (for
fear of being capsized)  
Then he could carry plenty upon his kayak.  
When I had to tow thee, and thou didst cry most pitiful,  
And thou didst grow afeared,  
And wast nearly upset,  
And hadst to keep thy hold by help of my kayak strings.

##### NOTES ON TEWA POEMS

In translating the Tewa language I have made use of the ordinary
conventions of phonetic writing, putting down the sounds as my ear
caught them It is to be expected that [inconsistencies](errata.htm#2.md)
should occur owing first to the varying enunciation of different
informants from the same village an secondly to the dialectic variation
among the five villages of Tesuque, Nambe, San Ildefonso, Santa Clara
and San Juan. The dialectic differences are partly seen in the musical
pitch or accent which I have made no effort to record. Tewa has many one
syllable words and these are distinguished from each other by subtle
modulations of the voice: but as a rule the context shows which one of
several homonyms is meant.

The Tewa language is richly vocalized, although the vowels often have
nasal qualities. The nasalization when present may be soft, or it may be
harsher and more ringing. These differences can be written by a small n
or ng above the affected vowel. It happens that both the musical pitch
and the qualities of nasalization vary somewhat among the villages of
the Tewa group and the present writer makes no claim for using all the
marks of a perfect record.

In general the vowels have Continental rather than English values, to
wit: *a* as in *ah*, *e* as in eight, *i* as in *machine*, *o* as in
*rose*, and *u* as the final sound in *who*. Also there is a common *a*
umlaut (ä), as in *man*, and another

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (â) with a very
broad sound, the *a* in *all*. Also it will be noted by those who
examine the original texts that vowels are frequently doubled in Tewa
with an apostrophe written between. This apostrophe indicates a closing
of the glottis and the second vowel is generally much shorter than the
first, like a kind of echo. Some of the consonants are found in three
forms, normal, aspirated and glottally affected. For instance we find
*k*, *kh*, and *k’*, the first like the English consonant, the second a
*k* stop followed by a breathing and the third having a somewhat
explosive sound to the common ear. Pretty clear stress accents are used
in the longer Tewa words.

Now follows a brief comment on each Tewa poem under the Roman numerals
which designate them. Space does not permit a full record of the native
texts but typical ones are given.

##### I

This ki kha’a or shouting song is sung by men at work in the fields or
coming home from the hunt. It refers to the annual rabbit drive and the
places mentioned are favorite hunting places of the San Juan Indians
corresponding to the four directions. The Road of Magic is the Road of
Life. But also it runs before the cradle and beyond the grave and is
travelled by the souls of the unborn and the ghosts of the dead. Along
this Magic Road come the Rain Gods, passing through lakes that are
gateways of the underworld.

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

##### II

The Tewa Indian easily becomes homesick even when distant a few miles
from his native village. This little song, which brought tears to the
eyes of one of my Tewa friends when I repeated it to him on his own
hearthstone, might be called Home Sweet Home. The text given below was
secured at Nambe, but I have heard a close variant at San Ildefonso. It
has a perfect poetic structure with what almost amounts to rhyme
although this is perhaps accidental. The Tewa singer depends upon
repeated phrases for the essential pattern of his verses.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Navi owin näwä owin näwä  
Navi owin näwä ndi on sha  
O’in p’in ndo mu’ire ka nyi nanandi  
Nâ re sitä: âhiyohe’e ewä,  
Ahiyohe’ ewä, ahiyohe’ ewä,  
Navi owin näwä ndi on sha.

</div>

I may say that the reduction of songs to a written text is not always
easy, nor can accuracy be guaranteed. Distortions of the words are often
caused by the musical measures which may be rationalized by different
informants in somewhat different fashion.

##### III

This second song of homesickness, coming from San Juan, is the complete
expression of a mood. It seems that memory is kindled, bursts into flame
and burns down to gray ashes in the short space of six lines.

##### IV

The use of affectionate diminutives such as *hâ e*, breath-little, and
*pi’e*, heart-little, is characteristic of Tewa love songs. There is
emotional purity without a touch of physical passion. The text, which is
followed closely in the translation, makes use of a sort of color
symbolism to vary the repeated phrases. The Tewa name for a love song is
se kane kha'a, and this very beautiful one comes from the village of
Santa Clara.

##### V

The note of banter in this little love song gives a picture of rustic
happiness to which no amount of fine phrases could add. The Tewa men in
their cornfields sing "shouting songs," such as this, which are
sometimes faintly audible to the women in the village.

##### IV

The comparison of a maiden and a flower is perhaps as old as any form of
poetic speech. Yet one may wonder whether the excessive use of "flowery
speech" by the Aztecs may not have set a fashion which spread to the
north.

I give the Tewa words with the stress accents:

Sú K’wa K’e wé na póvi tshá nde  
In póvi, in póvi, ndo mú iri  
Kányi na nándi na ré si tä!  
In póvi, in póvi, ndo mú iri  
Ts’e, okí, t’agi, na póvi tshá.

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

##### VII

Thamu or Dawn was an old man of Santa Clara who died when my informant
was a child. He would sing this derisive song to the girls as they
ground corn and retreat when they pelted him.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

U a wä nä i sen  
*Alas! this man  
*Mbi hi’i t’u  
*His words voice  
*Nda tage wage  
*And truth-like  
*Ndi hi’i an  
*When he talked to me*.  
He mbo wese  
*But right away  
*Wi hoyo sha,  
*You liar found  
*Wi hoyo sha!  
*You liar found!*

</div>

##### VIII

When the wrong man comes forward and the right one hangs back,
comparisons are in order. This is a relatively modern song from Nambe
and lacks the essential brevity—and clarity—of the accepted classics.

##### IX

The device of the colloquy is fairly common in Tewa poetry as it is in
that of ancient Mexico, without, of course, any interpolation of the
speaker's name. The girl in this case was nicknamed Little Blue because
the door frame of her house was painted that color. Her dismissal of the
errant but repentant swain ends with the phrase ''it was under guns that
you dared to pay", which means something done at a foolish risk.

##### X

Perhaps the lady doth protest too much—but at least she achieves a
precise expression of bitterness.

##### XI

The story behind this colloquy is that of an Indian youth of San Juan
who married a "Mexican" woman and went to live in Truchas. Again the
flower motive is used and by comparing this piece with VI and IX it is
at once apparent that here is a definite literary tradition.

##### XII

Two girls express their opinion of a third more fortunate one—and it
does not matter whether the aspersion was just or not.

##### XIII

Here is a brave pretense on both sides and might be called a teasing
song of parting:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

T’owepiye poge we nga he’i nä  
Ngo we’i nga kh a’a to ni  
Ito ki hä nyu mbai ye kin on sha  
An ki rang ndi yo’an.

</div>

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

##### XIV

This khe mä’i kha’a—ready-to-go song is not particularly war-like but
the Tewa seem never to have been a warlike people. The Navaho were, of
course, the common scourge of all the sedentary tribes. I secured two
variant texts, the shorter one running:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Na’imbi kwiyo’in unda ihä  
Nâ’ in se nän wigi hä pi  
Wâ save owinge piye i khe mä

</div>

##### XV

This song has been transcribed by Alice Corbin Henderson in her Red
Earth. The Tewa text runs about as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Nä t’o me impi yere  
Nä so’okuwa ko  
Nä so’okuwa ko  
Yare Khun tsâ wai’i  
Yagi wani na kha tu’un  
Ha we rana na’ a se.

</div>

For each verse the Corn Maiden of another quarter is named according to
the accepted symbolism of colors.

##### XVI

This is a corn grinding song. I think the blue flowers which grow around
the sacred lake of Nambe on Lake Peak arc meant. The significant words
are:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Povi tsâ wä t’u  
Opa keri tu na sa  
Tsi ko wa tin ki na sa

</div>

Corn grinding songs are of two kinds. The Ta kha’s are sung by the girls
themselves keeping time to the strokes of the hand stones. The other
kind called Nu to kha’s, night grinding songs, are sung by the men.

##### XVII

Another corn-grinding song.

##### XVIII

This was described as War Captain’s Song, this officer having charge of
the work outside the town.

##### XIX

The ’e kha’a, meaning child song is, of course, our lullaby. The verses
vary only in accordance with the circuit of the four directions. The
text for the last verse is:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Tampiye okhuwa povi napovisa  
*In the east cloud flower the blossom stands*  
Nda ng’u tsiguweno ko’in mu we’a  
*And then the lightning begins to flash*  
Nda ng’u kwan ta’a ita’a  
*And then the thunder it thunders*  
Nda ng’u kwa’a pose yemu  
*And then the fine rain falls*  
A’ a’ a ha.

</div>

##### XX

No comment is called for.

##### XXI

Here the little boy born in the spring, as we may know from his
springtime name Primrose, is old enough to have experienced the
discipline of the Cannibal Giants. These terrifying masked creatures
come to the village with whips and children who have been disobedient do
not enjoy their performances.

##### XXII

Here the little girl has an autumnal name. The sleepy little birds,
which are caught on the mountain and kept as pets, are supposed to have
a sympathetic influence on the child.

##### XXIII

This song is sung by children at play.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Sagi wo nging povi sa,  
Mbe ndu nde’e nging povi sa,  
P’o pe’e nging povi sa,

</div>

##### XXIV

The K’osa or Delight Makers belong to three orders, the Kwirana K’osa,
the Tewa K’osa and the Tema K’osa. This initiation chant of the Kwirana
K’osa expresses the high spiritual purpose of these sacred clowns. It
seems that the institution is distributed among all the village Indians
of the Southwest. Mrs. Matilda Cox Stephenson gives ceremonial material
on the Kwirana organization at Sia and I quote for comparison part of a
song secured by her:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

White floating clouds, clouds like plains,  
Sun, Moon, Puma, Bear, Badger, Wolf  
Eagle, Shrew, Elder War Hero, Younger War Hero,  
Warrior of the North, Warrior of the West,  
Warrior of the South, Warrior of the East,  
Warrior of the Above, Warrior of the Below,  
Medicine Water Bowl, Cloud Bowl, Ceremonial Water Bowl,  
I make a road of meal, the ancient road, the ancient road.

</div>

At the Hopi villages the order is called Pai-a kya-muh according to
Fewkes (A Journal of American Ethnology II pp. 10–11), a name which
seems to have been derived from Than phaiya tchamu of the Tewa text. Of
course Hano on the First Mesa is really a Tewa village.

##### XXV

In this Initiation Song of the Tewa K’osa the novitiate jests at Kâkanyu
Sendo and Uhu Sendo, two of the Cloud People who wear masks with large,
ring-shaped eyes. When the K’osa exclaims that the round eyes are being
carried off in the water the implication is that the rain gods
themselves arc being swept away. When pursued by the seemingly angry
gods he makes quick disclaimer. He declares that he meant only the
little cakes strung on a string which symbolize these round eyes.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

</div>

##### XXVI

This is described as a very sad pi nan kha'a or magic song of the Tewa
K’osa which all the Indians know but are afraid to sing. It means the
K’osa are going in under a sacred lake to the place where the rains and
the lightnings are made, all lakes being regarded as entrances to the
underworld. This song is sung on the shore of a certain lake in the
Santa Fé mountains especially sacred to Nambe.

##### XXVII

This passage is taken from a long myth of Nambe. It illustrated several
ceremonial usages of the K’osa: one is that they sometimes say the
opposite of what they mean such as designating one direction and
performing in another. The "lakes" where the gods dwell may be only
green spots. But the path of the rainbow upon which they travel is
thrown from one such station to the next.

##### XXVIII

This song is from the Flood Myth and is sung by Urn-tu-sendo, Walking
Stick Old man, who may be described as the Tewa Adam. When the flood
comes his daughters, the Blue Corn Girls are floated upward to the sky
in a basket and after adventures in the Sky World are lowered again to
earth by the Spider Woman.

##### XXIX

The sky loom I have already explained in the general introductory essay
as referring to the small desert rains which resemble a loom hung from
the sky. There are indications that this idea was applied elsewhere in
the Southwest and of course the symbolical decoration on the white
cotton mantle, once the regular dress but now put to ceremonial uses, is
in accordance with this chant or prayer for well-being.

##### XXX

The Sang khiu kwiyo or Corn Silk Women of San Juan are probably more or
less the same as the Pun kha kwiyo of Nambe and the Nan hwa kwiyo
Tesuque. They are a society who play a special role in certain very
sacred dances connected with fertility. They appear in the Kwiyo or
Woman's Dance. In this chant there are several examples of what my
informants call "high words" such as wowa tsi, literally "life eye" but
really "hale old age," ’e t’owa sowe, literally "children people grow
up" but with the

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

normal meaning of "rear many children". Si ge muni means "under the
loving protection of the gods".

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

##### XXXI

This is a kwa pinan kha'a or Rain-Magic song, from the Than khohe share
or Sun-Hummingbird Dance of San Juan. The humming bird is a symbol of
the flowering season and this magic song is accompanied by the
sprinkling of water with feather aspergils. Here the action of the
ceremony is designed to suggest similar action by the gods.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

O’ke owinge nä we ho ngi win

The words for the six directions are interestingly different. Below is
Nan suge u'unge, earth drinking below. The Underworld is personified as
male, as is the Sky, while the Earth itself is female. Here the earth is
Nan otchu kwiyo, Earth-fresh-green-woman.

##### XXXII

The Oku share or Turtle Dance is a winter ceremony having to do with
fertility, the Ok huwa or Cloud People who come to this ceremony bring
with them the seeds of various plants and they are also asked to ensure
that children will be plentiful: the dance is there also called ’E pinan
share. Children's Magic Dance. I give four songs from the sets used at
Nambe which refer to the revival of the vernal season and the rains
which will bring the harvest to maturity.

##### XXXIII

Two songs from the Turtle Dance at Santa Clara give further indication
of the nature of the magical prayers, made in the form of songs, to
perfect the lot of human beings. The second song, omitting meaningless
refrains, has the following words:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

So’okuwa okhuwa povi  
*Fog clouds, cloud flowers  
*Tä mä p’in nä  
*Various mountains on Okhuwa  
*povi sa ho’o  
*Cloud flowers put forth now  
*P’in phâ geri tsigu wänu  
*From the north lightning  
*Ho’o re mu wa’a

*Kwâ t’an ho’o re ta’a  
*Thunder now rumbles  
*Kwâ p’o ho’o re yemu.  
*Rain water now is falling*.

##### XXXIV

The Tewa villages are all divided into two groups of clans, one commonly
known as the Summer People and the other as the Winter People. The Race
Dance seems to be a special magical effort to relieve the Sun in its
travels, especially while the Sun seems tired at the solstices. Some
idea of the astronomical significance appears in the words. The
Great-Star of the Dark Night Man appears to be Jupiter.

*Summer People's Song*

##### XXXV

Avanyu or P’o anyu is pictured as a horned serpent often with clouds
attached to his body and a tongue of barbed lightning. He is a dreaded
god of storms, sometimes glimpsed in dark swirling clouds. Once this
water monster threatened to flood the world but he was turned from this
evil intention by twin war gods, called Towa’e or Little People, who
slew him with their arrows and left his body lying as the rocky barriers
of Nambe falls. The diminished flood still pours out of his great mouth
and offerings are made to appease him if the stream rises suddenly. In
another conception he resides in sacred lakes and moves in storm clouds.
Almost certainly the various plumed and horned serpents of the Southwest
are a far-off echo of the feathered serpent of the Mayas and Mexicans.

As a rule the name Avanyu is anathema. This short religious song in
which he is appealed to comes from the Than kwa share, or Sun-Rain
Dance, of Nambe held just before the sun reaches his northern Sun House
at the summer solstice. At San Juan foot races are held in connection
with the same event.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

##### XXXVI

The Scalp Dance was especially developed at Santa Clara or perhaps a
memory of the ceremony has survived there in more perfect state than
elsewhere. It seems that Coyote gets his ceremonial name Stretched-Out
in-Dew as a devourer of slain warriors. The text of the second part of
this song is as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*Hä nyi ipi nda’a ri

This piece is entitled Ko’on pinan kha’a ndi a iri—Buffalo Magic Song,
Making Come. It is an example of the coercive use of song. The first

an old town belonging to Tesuque.

While her husband is hunting the deer, the woman tries her magic. She
lays a cotton thread as a road leading into her house and sits in a
corner and sings this magical song.

##### XXXIX

To come with dangling hands is to come head down over the hunter’s
shoulder.

In the Deer Dance at Nambe, as at other pueblos of the Rio Grand, the
dancers costumed to represent deer, elk, antelope, mountain sheep and
mountain goats, make a dramatic entrance into the dance plaza. This is
the song of welcome made by the chorus.

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

##### XLI

This is a Tesuque song used in the Eagle Dance.

##### XLII

When the Tewa made dangerous trips to trade with the nomadic Indians of
the plains they were under the charge of their war captain. Each night
of the journey one member of the party spoke this speech from a hill
top, to bring good luck to the venture.

##### XLIII

I have taken some liberties in the arrangement of this prayer and
therefore give the original text with interlinear translation. Some of
the "high words" have already been discussed.

The Corn Mothers are represented by little idols made from ears of corn.

##### XLV

Although prayers vary somewhat, these are several well-defined patterns.

##### XLVI

A child may be given several names.

##### XLVII

It is a developed idea among the Tewa that one in authority needs the
qualities of both sexes.

##### XLVIII

There is really no tabu among the Tewa against speaking the names of the
dead but apparently they believe that the spirits of the dead should
leave the homes of the living.

##### XLIX

This is a part of the Scalp Ceremony of Santa Clara.

##### XL

Whenever possible a secret grave is made for the warrior who dies in
battle.
