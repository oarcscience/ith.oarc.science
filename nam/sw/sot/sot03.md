### AN ESSAY ON AMERICAN INDIAN POETRY

*with a selection of outstanding compositions from North and South
America*

A GIFT of noble art in all its manifestations, destined to gather golden
opinions with the passing centuries, forms part of the splendid heritage
with which America of the past endows America of the future. The Redman
has never received the credit due him for his fundamental contributions
to human welfare and permanent civilization. On the utilitarian side
stand the remarkable series of economic plants which the Indian brought
to a high state of cultivation and the important industrial processes
which he invented. On the esthetic side stand beauty in sculpture and
architecture, beauty in traditional literature of myths, songs and
ritualistic poems, beauty in dances and spectacular ceremonies, and
beauty, above all, in the ethical and philosophical attitude of man
towards man and of man towards nature.

It is easy enough to show that the useful gifts of the American Indian
assume gigantic values today, especially since more than half the
present agricultural wealth of the United States comes from plants which
he tamed. It is not so easy to estimate the influence of his esthetics
upon the present culture of his conquerors, but the coming effect will
surely be very great. The Indian has abundantly demonstrated his ability
to build up and maintain the social illusions of grandeur. Now between a
nation which exists as an accumulation of individual abilities and
individual achievements—and we are scarcely more than this today in
spite of a certain mechanistic ordering—and a nation which finds a truly
artistic and communal expression of its cooperative life,

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

capable of enriching and ennobling that life, there is a vast and vital
difference. Perhaps in this survey of the poetry of the American Indian
I shall be able to define this difference in comprehensive terms.

The creative individuals of the Red race, the poets, the artists, the
philosophers, whatever their forgotten names may be, had this in common:
they were one and all the architects of mass illusion. They were culture
heroes, and to my mind this is the highest purpose to which supreme
abilities may be devoted. Seeing in the realities the world about them
the indices of divine intention, their minds reached out to win an
invisible empire. Although possessing separate abilities they were not
individualists in spirit but collectivists, and the self-contained
societies which they erected were super-organisms instinct with
over-souls.

Perhaps the cultural units of ancient America represent primary or
youthful civilization. Such a classification would well fit the first
splendid efflorescence of the Mayas which produced writing, astronomical
science, permanent architecture and high art. Here, if ever, we find
self-sufficiency, a nation growing like a tree. For the Mayas drew
wealth from their own soil and developed their supreme arts by an
intelligent use of leisure in furtherance of their social ideals. It
seems that the same process was repeated elsewhere in America. But also
it is clear enough that the Incas and the Aztecs had hit upon the
deceptive advantages of aggressive warfare in the quick up-building of
their respective states. Their predatory policy was still tentative, for
the undeveloped condition of both offensive and defensive military
science among the American Indians in general proves that the procedures
of conquest, tribute and trade were never fully established. The Redman
had to dance

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

himself into war or find a just cause for it in the imagined appetites
of his gods.

##### THE INDIAN AND HIS COSMOS

<span class="smallcaps">In his</span> relations with the immeasurable
world about him the American Indian, even today and whatever the state
of his culture, exhibits a single psychological attitude. Man is never
the lord of creation but always a pensioner on natural bounty. It has
been the custom to dismiss the religion of our Indian tribes as
animistic in the lower stages and mystic in the higher ones, a
classification which certainly emphasizes the supremacy of spiritual
forces over material ones. Beginning with a naive belief that a
directive mentality combines with a directed physical body in animals,
plants and natural objects as it does in man, the first aim of Indian
religion has been to make friends with nature whenever possible and when
not possible to circumvent in some way the inimical forces. From this
universal animism beast gods emerge as the embodiments of natural
powers. Ultimately these beast gods combine into composite monster gods
which gradually take on human attributes of shape and character. But
very early in the development of this system the idea of a single
pervasive control makes its appearance, a primal cause, a creator, a
modifier, who may deal out rewards as well as punishments.

The Yokuts Indian of California, after appealing to seven vague deities
whom he names in order, ends with the request that he may fit into a
universal scheme <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](sot56.htm#fn_0.md).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

My words are tied in one  
With the great mountains,  
With the great rocks,  
With the great trees,  
In one with my body  
And my heart.

Do you all help me  
With supernatural power,  
And you, Day  
And you, Night!  
All of you see me  
One with this world!

</div>

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

In a closing comment on this primitive Californian prayer, Kroeber says:
"A certain vastness of conception and profoundness of feeling rising
above any petty concrete desire, cannot be denied this petition."

Out on the Great Plains the mystery which pervades the universe is
called Wakonda by several Siouan tribes. The quest of Wakonda by the man
who would know things "that are fit to serve as symbols" is thus
described in the Osage Rite of the Chiefs <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](sot56.htm#fn_1.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">In the midst of the open prairie, where trees grow
not,  
As he sat upon the earth to rest he thought: This spot, also, may be
Wakonda's abode!  
Then he inclined his head towards his right side,  
Bent his body low,  
And Wakonda made him close his eyes in sleep.</span>

</div>

From the Osage informant who gave Francis La Flesche the important
rituals of this tribe comes an explanation of Wakonda <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](sot56.htm#fn_2.md). It was the ancients who devised
the ritualistic songs, the ceremonial forms and symbols out of their
insight into natural mysteries, arising from their power to search with
the mind. They noted the -mysteries of the light of day by which the
earth and all living things that dwell thereon are influenced; the
mysteries of the darkness of night that reveal to us all the great
bodies of the upper world, each of which forever travels in a circle
upon its own path unimpeded by the others. They searched for a long
period of time for the source of life and at last came to the thought
that it issues from an invisible creative power to which they applied
the name Wakonda." This from one American Indian to another!

Wakonda and his congeners—for the name varies with the language—resides
in the heavens and sometimes

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

appears to his petitioners in human guise, but aged and austere. In
literature dealing with the Indian he is generally referred to as the
Great Mystery but he might with equal propriety be called Ultimate Good.

The Pueblo Indians of the Southwest speak of their Earth Mother and Sky
Father and in a chant of the Tewa (see number XXIX below) ask for a
garment to be woven on the gossamer loom, strung from the sky by the
desert rains, that they may walk fittingly in a decent world. If only
our materialistic civilizations now stripping the earth in a mad
holocaust could pause and take counsel from the calm wisdom of this
prayer! But it seems that we accept no lesson from the past and owe no
duty to the future. The destruction of forests and all natural resources
goes on, the flocks of wild birds and herds of wild animals die and we
pollute the streams. Enslaving or exterminating undefended peoples
around the world we enslave ourselves to sordid appetites and
disillusions.

The Aztecs had a vague supreme deity called Ometeuctli—Lord of
Duality—who combined the masculine and feminine principles in one
creator god dwelling in a topmost heaven.

Nezahualcoyotl, the emperor-poet of Texcoco, is credited by the Mexican
historian, Ixtlilxochitl, with having taught that there was one god
supreme above all others named Tloque Nahuaque: "In the ninth tier was
the creator of heaven and earth, by whom live the created beings: an
only god who created all visible and invisible things." This most famous
poet of ancient Mexico also realized the ethical implications of this
reduction in his emphasis on just deeds as the proper worship to be
offered to an eternal principle. In a poem intended to be sung in his
presence we find these verses <span
id="fr_3"></span>[4](sot56.htm#fn_3.md):

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Little will fame have to tell of this wondrous majesty, worthy of a
thousand heralds, the nations will only remember how wisely governed the
three chieftains who held the power.

At Mexico Montezuma the famous and valorous, at Culhuacan the fortunate
Nezahualcoyotl, and at the stronghold of Acatlapan, Totoquilhuatli.

I fear no oblivion for thy just deeds, standing as thou dost in thy
place appointed by the Supreme Lord of All, who governs all things.

</div>

A most splendid Thanatopsis, attributed to Nezahualcoyotl, comes to us
through an Otomi transcription, offering internal evidence of its pagan
origin. I quote the English rendering of Brinton <span
id="fr_4"></span>[5](sot56.htm#fn_4.md). While faltering here and there in
exact phrasing, nevertheless the early American-ist caught the vast
scope of this poem. It expresses, as he says, an epicurean philosophy
but one permeated by ethical obligations.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. The fleeting pomps of the world are like the green willow trees,
which aspiring to permanence, are consumed by a fire, fall before the
axe, are upturned by the wind, or are scarred and saddened by age.

2\. The grandeurs of life are like the flowers in color and in fate; the
beauty of these remains so long as their chaste buds gather and store
the rich pearls of the dawn and saving it, drop it in liquid dew; but
scarcely has the Cause of All directed upon them the full rays of the
sun, when their beauty and glory fail, and the brilliant gay colors
which decked forth their pride wither and fade.

3\. The delicious realms of flowers count their dynasties by short
periods; those which in the morning revel proudly in beauty and
strength, by evening weep for the sad destruction of their thrones, and
for the mishaps which drive them to loss, to poverty, to death and to
the grave. All things of earth have an end, and in the midst of the most
joyous lives, the breath falters, they fall, they sink into the ground.

4\. All the earth is a grave, and nought escapes it; nothing is so
perfect that it does not fall and disappear. The rivers, brooks,
fountains and waters flow on, and never return to their joyous
beginnings; they hasten on to the vast realms of Tlaloc, and the wider
they spread between their marges the

</div>

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

more rapidly do they mould their own sepulchral urns. That which was
yesterday is not today; and let not that which is today trust to live
tomorrow.

5\. The caverns of earth are filled with pestilential dust which once
was the bones, the flesh, the bodies of great ones who sat upon thrones,
deciding causes, ruling assemblies, governing armies, conquering
provinces, possessing treasures, tearing down temples, flattering
themselves with pride, majesty, fortune, praise and dominion. These
glories have passed like the dark smoke thrown out by the fires of
Popocatepetl, leaving no monuments but the rude skins on which they are
written.

6\. Ha! ha! Were I to introduce you into the obscure bowels of this
temple, and were to ask you which of these bones were those of the
powerful Achalchiuhtlanextin, first chief of the ancient Toltecs; of
Necaxecmitl, devout worshipper of the gods; if I inquire where is the
peerless beauty of the glorious empress Xiuhtzal, where the peaceable
Topiltzin, last monarch of the hapless land of Tulan; if I ask you where
are the sacred ashes of our first father Xolotl; those of the bounteous
Nopal; those of the generous Tlotzin; or even the still warm cinders of
my glorious and immortal, though unhappy and luckless father
Ixtlilxochitl; if I continued thus questioning about all our august
ancestors, what would you reply? The same that I reply—I know not. I
know not; for first and last are confounded in the common clay. What was
their fate shall be ours, and of all who follow us.

7\. Unconquered princes, warlike chieftains, let us seek, let us sigh
for the heaven, for there all is eternal, and nothing is corruptible.
The darkness of the sepulchre is but the strengthening couch for the
glorious sun, and the obscurity of the night but serves to reveal the
brilliancy of the stars. No one has power to alter these heavenly
lights, for they serve to display the greatness of their Creator, and as
our eyes see them now, so saw them our earliest ancestors, and so shall
see them our latest posterity.

</div>

The human soul lost in the immensities of a space-time universe has no
recourse from oblivion save in those virtues which blossom in the dust.
This is the conclusion of the highest paganism. Seeing order in the
heavens instills a belief that there may be an ultimate order in the
solution of human affairs.

In conformity with the reflections of the great Mexican chieftain are
various ancient hymns and orations

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

which are ascribed to the kings of the Incas by one Joan de Santa Cruz
Pachacuti Yamqui Salcamaygua who wrote shortly after 1600. The hymn to
Viracocha, a master deity and creator god of Peru, is an oft-quoted
fragment of American Indian literature <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](sot56.htm#fn_5.md).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

O Viracocha, Lord of the Universe,  
Whether Thou be male or female  
At least lord of heat and generation!  
O such a one as can divine with spittle,  
Where art Thou?  
If only Thou wert near thy son!

Thou mayest be above,  
Thou mayest be below,  
Or round about Thy rich throne or staff.  
O listen to me!

From the sea above in which Thou mayest dwell,  
From the sea below in which Thou mayest be, Creator of the world,  
Maker of man,  
Lord of all lords!

With my eyes on Thee which fail to see Thee  
Yet desiring to know Thee!  
Might I behold Thee,  
Know Thee,  
Consider Thee,  
Understand Thee!  
For Thou beholdest me,  
Knowest me!

The Sun, the Moon  
The Day, the Night  
Summer, Winter  
Not vainly, in proper order,  
Do they march to the destined place,  
To the end!  
They arrive wherever Thy royal staff  
Thou bearest.  
Hear me!  
Heed me!  
Let it not happen  
That I grow tired,  
That I die!

</div>

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

So all prefiguring of space and time draws down to the focus of human
needs, of human understanding, and of human recognition of something
that goes beyond this understanding! Man is the animal who learned to
wonder, who learned to question the world, who learned to question
himself. Through the length and breadth of ancient America we discover
this primitive inquisitiveness and even in the songs of our Indians of
today. Here is one from the Pawnee <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](sot56.htm#fn_6.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Let me see, if this be real,  
Let me see, if this be real,  
Let me see, if this be real,  
Let me see, if this be real,  
This life I am living?  
Ye who possess the skies,  
Let me see if this be real,  
This life I am living.</span>

</div>

##### THE PLACE OF INDIAN POETRY IN THE ARTS

"<span class="smallcaps">All poetry</span>," says Grosse <span
id="fr_7"></span>[8](sot56.htm#fn_7.md), "comes from feeling and goes to
feeling, and therein lies the mystery of its creation and influence."
This writer of forty years ago did not have much truly primitive poetry
before him nor did he have much sensitive knowledge of the uses to which
that little had been applied in the life of primitive man. His basic
definition, "Poetry is the verbal representation of external or internal
phenomena in an esthetically effective form for an esthetic purpose,"
implied that the successful uses of words to express great thoughts and
tender feelings were, from the first, intentional creations of specially
gifted artists. But was this really the case?

Today, as a result of ethnological studies among nearly all the
surviving groups of low-cultured humans, we have masses of traditional
myths, songs and ritualistic

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

proceedings. The native forms of speech have been written out
phonetically, translated in the light of local associations, and
coordinated with the rhythms of musical accompaniment and with the
ordered action of dancing and ceremonial dramatizations in
sound-and-sight records. This slow and searching investigation has
proceeded without undue benefit from *a priori* considerations and
without undue loyalty to slender and precious definitions of what
distinguishes Art in a matrix of Custom.

The idea that the separate fine arts sprang full-armed from the brow of,
let us say, Apollo and that artists were, in the beginning or ever,
touched with divine afflatus has no more truth in it than the companion
concept that kings operate under a heavenly sanction. Anthropological
science can demonstrate easily enough that beauty emerges from use, and
that many ancient things which according to our specialized
appreciations are merely and completely beautiful were nevertheless
conceived for some magical or pseudo-practical service.

Poetry can hardly be called a primary art, at least that class of it
which needs only to be spoken or read. As used by the American Indians
and other so-called primitive groups, such as the Polynesians, poetry is
still a servant of music and ceremony rather than a freestanding
utterance. Perhaps this was also its former state in those classic lands
where lyrics no longer need the lyre and where ballads are seldom
actually sung to dancing feet. Owing to the lack of stringed instruments
in ancient America and the slight development of wind instruments the
drum exerted an outstanding influence on song, with some help from the
steady pulsations of canoe paddling, corn grinding and similar
exercises.

Among the Eskimo is found the Arctic tambourine

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

and throughout the New World drums of one kind or another are in use. In
ancient Mexico the two-lipped log drum had a double pitch and was
capable of producing a wide variety of sound patterns through
manipulation of the double tones in light and heavy strokes and changing
tempo <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](sot56.htm#fn_8.md). We must imagine that
melodic measures coincided with these drum beats and furnished a still
more intricate lay-out into which it was the poet's job to fit
intelligible words. The drum rhythms are indicated imitatively for a
considerable number of old Mexican songs and their variety may be
guessed from three examples <span id="fr_9"></span>[10](sot56.htm#fn_9.md).
While the iambic meter goes especially well with the Aztec language,
other meters were also employed: else how can the following onomatopoeia
of drum strokes be explained?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Tico, tico, toco toto, and as the song approached
the end, tiqui, titi, tito, titi.  
                  \*         \*         \*  
Quititi, quititi, quiti, tocoto, tocoti, tocoto, tocoti, and then it is
to turn back again.  
                  \*         \*         \*  
Toto, tiquiti, tiquiti, and then it ends, tocotico, tocoti, toto,
titiqui, toto, titiquiti.</span>

</div>

Modern examples of the ways in which words are forced into inflexible
moulds of music have been studied in phonographic records of songs from
the Eskimo, the Ojibwa and other tribes. Often the distortion is so
great that a song has meaning only for the composer. The expression may
be obscure enough in itself with farfetched figures of speech and
various poetic licenses. On top of this the warping of the words to the
rhythmic pattern sometimes calls for drastic syncopations and
reduplications, not to mention the interpolation of meaningless
syllables. Poetry schooled under such rigid restraints, and finally
overcoming them, inevitably becomes

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

differentiated from prose. There is a survival of the fittest
expressions until a standard of poetic phrasing becomes fixed.

The common use of extra, meaningless syllables to dilute the
intelligible parts of speech is illustrated in a Mide song of the Ojibwa
analyzed by Miss Densmore. The words are <span
id="fr_10"></span>[11](sot56.htm#fn_10.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ni wá waké abog´  
Wé wendjí dji wûñ´

A bubbling spring  
Comes from the hard ground.

</div>

The pulse of the drum is regular and the quarter note is maintained
except for the fifth and sixth measures. To fit a combination of 2–4,
3–4 and 4–4 time the words of the song are repeated and stretched out as
follows, the italicised syllables being interpolated.

|            |               |                             |
|------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| ....Wac    | ke a bog      | *o ho ho* ni                |
| wa *a* ac  | ke a bog      | o *ho ho ho ho ho ho ho* ni |
| wa *ha ha* |  wac ke a bog | *o ho ho* ni                |
| wa *ha ha* | wac ke a bog  | *o ho ho* ni                |
| wa *a* ac  | ke a bog      | *o ho ho* ni                |
| wa *a a*   | wac ke a bog  | *o ho ho*                   |
| we wen     | dji dji wuñ   | e *he he*                   |
| we wen     | dji dji wuñ   | e *he he he* ne             |
| wa *ha ha* | wac ke a bog  | *o ho ho* ni                |

There are many songs in which the burden is carried entirely by
meaningless syllables but it is not clear that such songs intergrade as
a class between instrumental music and songs with intelligible words. In
some cases the meaningless syllables may represent old songs, the words
of which have been distorted and forgotten, or foreign songs, the words
of which never were learned. It would help if we could really measure
the life of a song. We only know that the rich repertory of the Aztecs
and the Incas has been finished for centuries and that long life in an
unmodified state cannot be proven

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

for European ballads. Yet there is a common belief that the songs and
ceremonies of lowly cultured peoples are maintained from ancient times.
"The Amazonian," says Thomas Whiffen <span
id="fr_11"></span>[12](sot56.htm#fn_11.md), "treasures the songs of his
fathers and will master strange rhythms and words that for him no longer
have meaning; he only knows they are the correct lines, the phrases he
ought to sing at such functions, because they have always been sung."
This assumption of longevity for traditional songs is, I believe,
nothing more than a romantic exit for ignorance. Rather, it seems that
generations of song and ceremony succeeded each other like generations
of human beings, albeit with a longer natural life, and that survival of
traits, or at best survival of broken fragments, is all that should be
expected across a span of several centuries. A constant process of
leavening the present with the past is sufficient to explain all certain
facts.

Words adjusted to the metronome of the throbbing drum, or embodying a
rhythmic formality once removed, were composed by the American Indians
for various purposes and occasions. Many songs were framed for the uses
of magic, others to vivify ceremonies, others to express the deep
religious feelings of the social group. Relatively few Indian poems have
the strictly individualistic cast which distinguishes so many products
of our super-civilized nation. It seems that Indian singers did not
consciously cultivate the violent personal emotions for the trade, but
ventured only to put into words the social illusions in which they were
immersed. Now to examine the outstanding classes of Indian poetical
compositions.

##### REINCARNATION LULLABIES

<span class="smallcaps">Indian mothers</span> generally sing their
children to sleep with wordless songs but sometimes they use true
lullabies

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

as may be seen from the Tewa examples given below. There is, moreover, a
very special kind of lullaby which deals with reincarnation.

The Eskimo and several other northern tribes believe that the soul of a
dead relative enters into a new born child and watches over it during
its tender years. This person may be addressed, therefore, in the
child's lullaby and, vice versa, the child's prattling tongue may drop
words of wisdom, thanks to its experienced soul. While the lullabies of
eastern Greenland, which Thalbitzer calls petting songs, are of this
type they mostly lack artistic form and some are frankly licentious,
ascribing to the infant child the vices and ailments of its spiritual
tutor, perhaps as preventive magic. There are a few exceptions. A widow
whose dead husband had entered into his brother's son saw in this male
child her future provider, and addressed him with a song more befitting
our idea of what a lullaby should be. I quote the first of three similar
verses <span id="fr_12"></span>[13](sot56.htm#fn_12.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">How bland he is and gentle, the great little one
there!  
How bland he is and gentle—  
How amazing he is, the dear little creature!</span>

</div>

Among the Tlingit of southern Alaska and the Haida of Queen Charlotte
Island are found reincarnation lullabies of dignified phrasing which
Swanton has translated <span id="fr_13"></span>[14](sot56.htm#fn_13.md).
One such song apologizes for the mean life of the present as compared
with the exalted past; it is addressed to an old woman whose spiritual
personality continues its existence in a baby girl.

I

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">You need not think that the smoke of your house in
the middle of Skeedans will be as great as when you were a woman.</span>

</div>

II

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">You need not think they will make a continual noise
of singing in Skeedans Creek as they used to when you were a
woman.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

In still another reincarnation lullaby the fond mother beholds a famous
chieftain in her crawling infant.

I

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

He says it is Nañkilslas's great father moving along so greatly

Halloo, great chief moving about!

</div>

II

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Halloo, he moves along greatly like something extending to the sky.

Halloo, great chief moving about!

</div>

We must now note that as the child grows older his proper soul gradually
gets control over the body and the reincarnated adult soul fades away
into nothingness. So these northern peoples also have other songs fitted
to the understanding of little boys and girls. For instance the
Ammassalik Eskimo have a myth for children which tells how a raven
teased the geese and how the geese in revenge enticed the raven far out
over the sea. When they settled on the water, he was unable to swim. A
song describes his fate <span id="fr_14"></span>[15](sot56.htm#fn_14.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Halloo, I sink, help me up, Ugh!  
Now the water reaches my great ankles,  
Hallow, I sink, help me up,  
Ugh! Now it reaches my great knees.  
Hallow, I sink, help me up, [Ugh](errata.htm#0.md)!  
Now it reaches my great groins  
Hallow, I sink, help me up, Ugh!  
Now it reaches my great navel  
Hallow, I sink, help me up, Ugh!  
Now it reaches my great breasts  
Hallow, I sink, help me up, Ugh!</span>

</div>

And so on until the water reaches the great eyes of the insolent raven;
then the song ends with an expressive Ugh!

Elsewhere songs for children and songs in myths which are used largely
in the education of children

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

emphasize the magical factor. A selection of songs for children from the
village of Picuris in New Mexico has been published by John P.
Harrington and Helen Roberts <span
id="fr_15"></span>[16](sot56.htm#fn_15.md). A story tells how a
child-stealing giant is overcome by a youth's magical songs. The boy's
first song sung while he is being carried away in a basket, ends with
the phrase:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">A person who is very kind is carrying me on his
back.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This has the
magical effect of increasing the load and tiring out the giant. Later
when the giant covers the youth with pitch and throws him in the fire a
second song is sung the burden of which is:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">A person who is very kind has put me in a warm
place.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This has the
magical effect of lulling the giant to sleep and the youth steps out of
the fire and kills him. The point of this tale is that songs are more
potent than common prose, a lesson which the Indian carries through
life.

##### GUARDIAN SPIRIT SONGS

<span class="smallcaps">Indian boys</span> of many tribes, and sometimes
girls as well, were accustomed to pass through the supreme experience of
having revealed to them in a vision a guardian spirit, their special
link with the mystical hinterworld. The oldest and best songs of the
Plains tribes are said to have been "composed in dreams'' and Miss
Frances Densmore thinks that this is only the Indian's way of expressing
what we mean by "poetic inspiration." But there was perhaps more method
in the Redman's madness.

The Indian youth sought his vision with hope and faith, keeping a lonely
vigil till common realities faded and subconscious desires became
manifest as spiritual realities. The guardian spirit song of one of my
old

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nez Percé friends
was a vividly descriptive phrase or two set up in the midst of
meaningless syllables. His vision revealed Coyote returning from
successful warfare and the intelligible part of the song ran as
follows:.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Ravening Coyote comes,  
red hands, red mouth,  
necklace of eye-balls!</span>

</div>

The man's sacred name was Silu-we-haikt which means
Eyes-Around-the-Neck. The dream song was first revealed by the dreamer
in the annual Guardian Spirit Dance where each dancer costumed himself
according to the nature of his vision. Guardian spirit songs could be
inherited and so might pass into a tribal thesaurus of poetic
expressions. There was undoubtedly a bond between persons with the same
protecting animal, a fact of interest in relation to the origin of
totemic clans and esoteric societies. Among the Nez Percé, where neither
clans nor warriors' societies had developed, there was an unusual number
of mad coyote songs, the result of visions which ensured military
success. One ran about like this:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Mad Coyote,  
madly sings,  
then roars the west wind!</span>

</div>

and another:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Day break finds me,  
eastern day break finds me  
the meaning of that song:  
with blood-stained mouth,  
comes mad Coyote!</span>

</div>

Among the Teton Sioux the men who had the unusual success of obtaining a
Thunder-bird vision fell in a special group called Heyoka and at certain
times had

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

to express themselves in an opposite fashion from normal people. Lone
Man of this tribe put on record the details of his vision and the four
songs given him by the Thunder-bird people who appeared as horsemen in
the clouds. The last one can be arranged as follows <span
id="fr_16"></span>[17](sot56.htm#fn_16.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Friends, behold!  
sacred I have been made.  
Friends, behold!  
in a sacred manner I have been influenced.  
At the gathering of the clouds  
sacred I have been made.  
Friends, behold!  
sacred I have been made.</span>

</div>

A Thunder-bird song of the Ojibwa seems to depart still farther from the
realities of earth <span id="fr_17"></span>[18](sot56.htm#fn_17.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Sometimes  
I go pitying  
myself  
while I am carried by the wind across the sky.</span>

</div>

Thunder-bird songs were also developed in connection with the Ghost
Dance Religion which I discuss in another place. Such a piece from the
Arapaho has always had for me a strong appeal <span
id="fr_18"></span>[19](sot56.htm#fn_18.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">My children, my children,  
It is I who make the thunder as I circle about—  
      The thunder as I circle about.  
My children, my children,  
It is I who make the loud thunder as I circle about  
      The loud thunder as I circle about.</span>

</div>

Among some of the Plains tribes there were dream societies formed by men
who had visions of the buffalo, the elk, the bear, etc., which were
believed to convey special powers and faculties. Thus the men who
dreamed of the bear had songs which helped in curing ceremonies.

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

##### SONGS AS THE INSTRUMENTS OF MAGIC

Believing in the spirituality of plants, animals and even stones it is
not surprising that the Indians found ways to make special appeals to
the personalities in nature who exemplified special faculties and who
might be induced to tutor man. Thus the Eskimo hunter sings <span
id="fr_19"></span>[20](sot56.htm#fn_19.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">What animal's sharp sight  
Have I for my sharp sight?  
The gull's sharp sight  
Have I for my sharp sight!</span>

</div>

This song is not to be construed as a boast but as a petition. It seems
that mere statement when made in the form of a song is compulsive.
Indeed, "to sing" often means "to make magic," and back of it all lies
the idea that the song has been ordained. The Pima put the matter
thus <span id="fr_20"></span>[21](sot56.htm#fn_20.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Earth Magician now comes hither,  
Earth Magician now comes hither.  
From the depths the songs are rising  
And by him are here established.</span>

</div>

The hunting animals sing their songs in myths and on inquiry it
transpires that these same songs are re-sung by men who wish to have
success in hunting.

Of course this procedure is merely an aspect of sympathetic magic in
which descriptive words in a musical setting are held to be as potent as
painted symbols in other circumstances. A myth of the Pawnee tells how a
boy recovered a stolen robe bearing symbols of the storm, invoking the
storm itself to destroy the thief. I quote a portion of this myth <span
id="fr_21"></span>[22](sot56.htm#fn_21.md).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The young man went through the village from one tipi
to the other asking for his robe. The people had not seen it. At last he
went up to the Witch-Woman and asked if she had</span>

</div>

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

seen anything of his robe. She said: "No, I have not seen your robe." At
the same time she made faces at the young man, saying to herself: "You
will never find the robe. I now have it for a skirt." The young man went
through the village again. He stood in the west, then walked through the
village singing:

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I am hunting a robe.  
My painted robe I am hunting.  
The heavens are painted upon it.  
Attention! It is among the people.  
Attention! It is among the people.  
Attention! It is among the people.</span>

</div>

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

When the old woman heard this she began to clap her hands and said: "The
robe must be a wonderful one, but you shall never again have it in your
hands, for the robe is my skirt." The boy sang again:

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I am hunting a robe.  
Who picked it up?  
Flocks of swallows are painted upon it . . .</span>

</div>

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

When the woman heard it she said: "It must be a wonderful robe, but you
shall never have it again, for I now have it for my skirt." The boy
continued to sing:

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I am hunting a robe.  
Who has picked it up?  
Dragon-flies are painted upon it . . .</span>

</div>

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

At last the boy began to sing:

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I am hunting a robe.  
Who has picked it up?  
The lightning is painted upon it . . .

I am hunting a robe.  
Who has picked it up?  
The thunders are painted upon it . . .

I am hunting a robe.  
Who has picked it up?  
The winds are painted upon it.  
Attention! It is among the people.  
Attention! It is among the people.  
Attention! It is among the people.

</div>

</div>

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The Witch-Woman heard this song and she said: "Do
you think I am going to be blown away when I have more power than you
have?" The boy cried again. As he finished he blew his breath from the
west to where the woman stood. Then he cried again and this time clouds
were seen coming from the west. Clouds blew over the land. When the boy
cried the fourth time the old woman took the robe off and threw it down
and said: "My grandchild, there is your robe. You must not let the storm
blow me away." Just about that time the wind caught the old woman and
whirled her up into the heavens as if a whirlwind had struck her. It
began to rain all over the land.</span>

</div>

When we find in Indian poetry what seems to be an individual's emotional
reaction to natural beauty, in keeping with our own romantic traditions,
we should ask whether this is not a purposeful appreciation of the
friendly aspects of nature in keeping with the Redman's philosophy that
to imitate the way in which good is done is to insure the repetition of
that good. For instance, take a Papago song recorded by Frances
Densmore <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](sot56.htm#fn_22.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">By the sandy water I breathe the odor of the sea,  
From there the wind comes and blows over the world.  
By the sandy water I breathe the odor of the sea,  
From there the clouds come and the rain falls over the world.</span>

</div>

To us these simple and majestic lines present a moving picture. From the
given objective facts we construct some old experience and feel the
immensity of the roaring ocean while storm racks pile up from below the
horizon. Perhaps there comes over our minds a shadow of loneliness for
we are accustomed to be sad in the presence of natural beauty—as though
we had lost an animal birthright on getting civilized. We may even
recall the similar lines which Gustavo Becquer wrote while starving in
his garret in Madrid. But what a difference between the two songs when
one scans the innermost

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

sense. The first verse of Becquer's rhyme can be put in English as
follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Waves gigantic that break yourselves roaring  
On beaches deserted and distant,  
Wrapped in the sheet of the seafoam,  
      Carry me with you!</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In this verse, and
the three others that follow it, the German-Spanish romanticist
dramatizes his personal despair.

Sometimes I think that individualism is only another social mode, and
that it is made possible as a literary method by the psychic unity of
mankind. Each person may find in himself a microcosm or miniature world
and by correctly representing his own emotions discover a key to the
microcosm, or great world. Nevertheless the individualist goes through
the motions of being antisocial, using society's words and society's
conventions and shouting independence in accepted patterns through the
bars of his prison cell. But the Papago song of the salt-gatherers is no
enactment of personal joy or anguish but a rehearsing of nature's drama
for the good that it may bring. This ulterior thought does not impair
the validity of the esthetic experience and its proper expression any
more than a fulfillment of function impairs the perfection of a wild
rose. To be sure artificial cultivation for either a poem or a flower
may proceed at the expense of function and end in sterile beauty.

It is difficult to say at what point beauty is recognized for itself
alone, as a purely sensuous gratification. Of course, it is often
possible to construe an Indian poem as a mere lyrical outburst. For
instance, there is this one <span
id="fr_23"></span>[24](sot56.htm#fn_23.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">As my eyes search the prairie,  
I feel the summer in the spring.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Yet we are
informed that this belongs in the magical category of dream songs.

By and large, the more backward tribes of both North and South America
pay much attention to magic songs and some tribes possess little else.
On the higher planes of culture the magical uses of poetry expand into
great religious pieces. The Osage invocations to their sacred animals,
patrons of tribal divisions, friends and benefactors of man are examples
of this expansion. I quote the first and last passages in the *wi-gi-e*
or introduction to the ceremony of incensing the seven sacred skins in
the Rite of the Wa-xo-be. The lynx, the gray wolf, the puma, the black
bear, the buffalo, the elk and finally the deer are set forth as symbols
of courage <span id="fr_24"></span>[25](sot56.htm#fn_24.md).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">What shall the little ones make to be their symbol
of courage as they travel the path of life? it has been said, in this
house.  
The little mottled lynx that lies outstretched, they said,  
He who is their grandfather, a person of great courage, they shall make
to be their symbol of courage, it has been said, in this house.  
At break of day  
My grandfather rushed forth to attack a deer with curved horns.  
My grandfather struck the deer and made it lie outstretched in death.  
My grandfather approached the fallen deer with an air of exultation;  
He gave a cry of triumph, and spake saying:  
When, towards the setting sun the little ones go forth to strike the
enemy,  
In this manner they shall always triumph.  
Their hands shall ever be upon the foe, as they travel the path of
life,  
Here he made a curve it is said in this house.  
                \*    \*    \*    \*    \*  
What shall the little ones make to be the symbol of courage, as they
travel the path of life? it has been said, in this house.  
The little animal that lies outstretched, they said, He who is their
grandfather, although he has no gall,</span>

</div>

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">They shall make to be their symbol of courage.  
It was he who came upon four villages.  
Close along their borders he ran swiftly without harm.  
Even when he runs close to the borders of a village,  
The arrows of his pursuers flying about him,  
He escapes all dangers.  
He it was who said: When the little ones make of me their symbol of
courage,  
They shall always escape dangers,  
So shall it be even with one of the little ones,  
They shall cause their hands to be ever present upon the foe,  
as they travel the path of life, it has been said, in this house.</span>

</div>

I suppose the average modern city-dweller sees in these sentiments of
primitive religion merely the workings of the pathetic fallacy. Properly
here are shifting lights from an old American world of ordered
loyalties, which a hundred generations past our own forefathers of weald
and down might also have understood. But with hard-bitten logic and
under the sovereignty of our own destructive powers we have withdrawn
from all democratic contact with the animate children of Mother
Earth—except, perhaps, when a lonely man finds something unpurchasable
in the companionship of a dog. Even those plants and animals which are
necessary to our well-being are no longer the recipients of our
gratitude. Our religious sentiment outlaws them as it outlaws the sun
and rain. Nature and all its works are merely materials to be taken,
wasted and destroyed without responsibility to the past or to the
future. But let us not make the mistake of thinking that the throwing
off of natural bonds has been an act of wisdom or of intellectual
freedom, for today we make a less worthy obeisance to our own inanimate
machines, setting up a thousand nervous gods of speed and death and a
thousand fleshy gods of comfort and decay. Have these things given a
truer purpose to our lives and a finer inward happiness?

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

Under the inspiration of religion, albeit pagan, the makers of
ceremonies, as Emerson says, "built better than they knew." One finds
passages of great beauty in the rituals of the Redman. In the Osage Rite
of the Chiefs there are descriptive touches such as the following <span
id="fr_25"></span>[26](sot56.htm#fn_25.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">In the fourth valley  
He beheld seven bends of a great river  
Enwrapped in a cloud of white smoke from many fires.  
Seven villages he saw among the seven bends of the river  
Enwrapped in a cloud of white smoke from many fires.</span>

</div>

But are not ceremonial vestments embroidered and sacred altars enriched?

##### TRIAL BY POETRY

In the Far North enemies engage in poetic duels and intone their pleas
for the public ear to the beat of the Arctic tambourine. Here nith
songs, also called juridical songs and drum-contest songs, take the
place of courts of law, the two contestants having it out with each
other in a rival display of argument and vituperation. Undoubtedly the
Eskimo in general get much pleasure in listening to these contests and
the contestants themselves are not moved by bitter feelings alone. The
airing of grievances and the gaining of public sympathy were undoubtedly
the original purposes of the drum-contests but the theatrical
opportunities were too great not to be seized upon. Drum-contest songs
are still in use from Eastern Greenland to Western Alaska and their
influence continues well down the Pacific coast.

Something of the yearning to excel in this strange practise is expressed
in the following verses which tell how a man on shore sees a stranger on
the sea and desires him as a drum-contest opponent <span
id="fr_26"></span>[27](sot56.htm#fn_26.md).

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Again, it seems that he down there will come
ashore,  
That that great kaiak down there will come ashore.  
Will he not come this way, too, he down there,  
One from another place than ours, will he not come here?  
What a surprise! I can not forbear looking at him.  
Will he not come this way, he down there, who does not belong here?  
It's as if he down there is suspicious and wary of one,  
How often has lie down there sung drum-fight songs?  
How many opponents in the drum-fight has he had?  
What if he also made me one of his opponents!</span>

</div>

An old pair of juridical songs concerns antagonists by the names of
Pulangit-Sissok and Savdlat, who rail at each other in the approved
fashion. The text was collected by Rink in the late ’60's but the first
half of the dialogue was recovered by Thalbitzer some 80 years later in
a somewhat softened form <span id="fr_27"></span>[28](sot56.htm#fn_27.md).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*Savdlat speaks:  
*The South shore, O yes, the South shore I know it;  
Once I lived there and met Pulangit-Sissok,  
A fat fellow who lived on halibut, O yes, I know him.  
Those South-shore folks can't talk;  
They don't know how to pronounce our language;  
Truly they are dull fellows;  
They don't even talk alike;  
Some have one accent, some another;  
Nobody can understand them;  
They can scarcely understand each other.

*Pulangit-Sissok speaks:  
*O yes, Savdlat and I are old acquaintances;  
He wished me extremely well at times;  
Once I know he wished I was the best boatman on the shore;  
It was a rough day and I in mercy took his boat in tow;  
Ha! ha! Savdlat, thou didst cry most pitiful;  
Thou wast awfully afeared;  
In truth, thou wast nearly upset;  
And hadst to keep hold of my boat strings,  
And give my part of thy load.  
O yes, Savdlat and I are old acquaintances.

</div>

The drum contest songs were used by both men and

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

women and the next example shows one woman paying her respects to
another. It seems that the "poor Saatina" could not sing but was
efficient enough at playing the tom-boy <span
id="fr_28"></span>[29](sot56.htm#fn_28.md).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I recognized the poor Saatina  
Who could not sing.  
I recognized the poor Saatina  
Who could not make drum songs.  
No, she was not such a one.  
A right merry person,  
A bright woman,  
Who always sang on the island Aaluib,  
Who always squalled with all her might.</span>

</div>

It was doubtless through the training received in drum-contest songs
that the Eskimo reached their rather exceptional ability at expressing
moods. Also the Eskimo lack the intensively developed ceremonialism of
American Indians in general, although possessing its rudiments, and they
live close to hard realities. Take for instance the following piece
which exhibits a quality of subjective insight rarely met with in
primitive poetry <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](sot56.htm#fn_29.md).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Great grief came over me—  
Great grief came over me,  
While on the fell above us I was picking berries.  
Great grief came over me  
My sun rose quickly over it.  
Great sorrow came over me.  
The sea out there off our settlement  
Was beautifully quiet—  
And the great, dear paddlers  
Were leaving out there—  
Great grief came over me  
While I was picking berries on the fell.

</div>

A much quoted poem exhibits a love of natural beauty apparently for
itself alone. But there may have been in the author's mind an ulterior
thought concerning seasonable weather <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](sot56.htm#fn_30.md).

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I look toward the south, to great Mount Koonak,  
To great Mount Koonak, there to the south;  
I watch the clouds that gather round him;  
I contemplate their shining brightness;  
They spread abroad upon great Koonak;  
They climb up his seaward flanks;  
See how they shift and change;  
Watch them there to the south;  
How the one makes beautiful the other;  
How they mount his southern slopes,  
Hiding him from the stormy sea,  
Each lending beauty to the other.

</div>

##### LOVE SONGS

While genuine love songs doubtless exist among some Indian tribes, their
importance has been over emphasized in many articles dealing with Indian
poetry. Indeed love songs are most in evidence in those localities where
the Indian women have been exposed to make-and-break contacts with
whalers, fur-traders, buccaneers and whatnot. Thalbitzer has no
divisions devoted to love songs in his work on the poetry of the
isolated Ammassalik Eskimo, nor do they exist among the Yuma. In
southern Alaska and British Columbia where fur-traders and whalers began
to congregate after the voyages of Cook and Vancouver there are songs of
stranded and forsaken women, some in the jumbled words of the Chinook
trade jargon and others in the native languages. The so-called love
songs of the Northwest Coast which seem most authentic fit into the
pattern of the poetic duel ridiculing persons who have inflicted harm
and with their answers are more like public quarrelling than expressions
of tender passion.

The following piece is translated from the Kwakiutl by Franz Boas and is
entitled a love song. It was sung by a jilted man <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](sot56.htm#fn_31.md).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Oh, how, my lady-love, can my thoughts be conveyed
to you, my lady-love, on account of your deed, my lady-love? <span
id="page_33">p. 33</span>  
In vain, my lady-love, did I wish to advise you, my lady-love, on
account of your deed, my lady-love.  
It is the object of laughter, my lady-love, it is the object of
laughter, your deed, my lady-love.  
It is the object of contempt, my lady-love, it is the object of
contempt, your deed, my lady-love.  
Oh, if poor me could go, my lady-love! How can I go to you, my
lady-love, on account of your deed, my lady-love?  
Oh, if poor me could go, my lady-love, to make you happy, my lady-love,
on account of your deed, my lady-love!  
Now, I will go, my lady-love, go to make you happy, my lady-love, on
account of your deed, my lady-love.  
Farewell to you, my lady-love! Farewell, mistress on account of your
deed, my lady-love!</span>

</div>

In another example a woman complains that her lover goes to Japan to
hunt for seals. Her plaint brings a rejoinder from the man that he is
returning post haste. Then there is a third song by him showing him
dismissed for all his pains. I give part of the song of Menmenlequelas
after Tsak Edek deserts him <span
id="fr_32"></span>[33](sot56.htm#fn_32.md).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">*Ye yaa ye ya ha!*  
You are cruel to me, you are cruel to me, you are cruel to me, my
dear!  
*Ye yaa ye ya ha!*  
You are hard-hearted against me, you are hard-hearted against me, my
love!  
*Ye yaa ye ya ha!*  
You are surpassingly cruel, you are surpassingly cruel against me, for
whom you pined.  
*Ye yaa ye ya ha!*  
She pretends to be indifferent, not to love me, my true-love, my dear.  
*Ye yaa ye ya ha!*  
Don't pretend too much that you are indifferent of the love that I hold
for you, my dear!  
*Ye yaa ye ya ha!*  
Else you may be too indifferent of the love that I hold for you, my
dear!  
*Ye yaa ye ya ha!*  
My dear, you are too indifferent of the love that I hold for you, my
dear!  
*Ye yaa ye ya ha!*  
My dear, you go too far, your good name is going down, my dear! <span
id="page_34">p. 34</span>  
Ye yaa ye ya ha.'  
Friends, it might be well if I took a new true-love, a dear one.  
Ye yaa ye ya ha.'  
Friends, it might be well if I had a new one for whom to pine, a dear
one.  
*Ye yaa ye ya ha!*  
I wish she would hear my love-song when I cry to my new love, my dear
one!</span>

</div>

Among the Ojibwa are found songs which can hardly be called love songs
in the ordinary sense since they are magical formulae with a practical
rather than a sentimental value. Frances Densmore gives four examples to
be used against the males, each song having its mnemonic picture on
birch bark <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](sot56.htm#fn_33.md).

There are, however, real love songs among the Ojibwa. These songs,
according to Miss Densmore, "mark a distinct phase in the development of
music as a means of expression." The words frequently run through the
entire song with little repetition and may be impromptu in their exact
form. The Ojibwa sing their love songs with a nasal twang which also
characterizes the

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

songs of the scalp dance although this similarity may be fortuitous.
Some of them are known to be old and may be sung with slight changes by
either men or women. Here is a good example <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](sot56.htm#fn_34.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Although he said it  
Still

</div>

Schoolcroft gives us an Ojibwa love song of a hundred years ago, which
whether strictly aboriginal or not, does have the iterative Indian
style <span id="fr_35"></span>[36](sot56.htm#fn_35.md).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I will walk into somebody's dwelling,  
Into somebody's dwelling will I walk.  
To thy dwelling, my dearly beloved,  
Some night will I walk, will I walk.  
Some night in the winter, my beloved  
To thy dwelling will I walk, will I walk.  
This very night, my beloved,  
To thy dwelling will I walk, will I walk.</span>

</div>

Love songs, except those which are supposed to have a magical and
coercive quality of gaining affections and which might better be called
love medicine, are not common among the tribes of the Great Plains. Nor
are such songs listed by Ruth Bunzel among the kinds in use at Zuñi. The
Tewa have them and I secured several examples in the forms of soliloquy
and colloquy. While these are clearly enough of Indian composition, I
believe the ultimate inspiration to have been Spanish. The same may be
said of numerous pieces in Mexico and Guatemala.

European influence of a still different sort has been noted on the
Mosquito Indians of Nicaragua. Cape Gracios á Dios and the hidden
lagoons on either hand were long the haunt of pirates and buccaneers,
and I

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

fancy these cutthroats might, in their softer moments, have been
sentimental enough. At any rate, in the middle of the last century the
natives of this adventurous shore had love songs, several of which were
written down by English residents. At the present time such songs are
rare for in several journeys to eastern Nicaragua I could not secure a
single example.

A fine piece, with original text and translation, is found in Charles
Napier Bell's *Tangweera* <span id="fr_36"></span>[37](sot56.htm#fn_36.md).
He explains that "the young men and women are melancholy, and it is
singular that all their music is melancholy. Cheerful music is quite
beyond them. Their love songs are plaintive and sad, always the same
tune and time, but the words are extemporized by them with a facility
which to us would be almost impossible.

I

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">My girl, some days as you walk with your

Alas! my lad have I seen the last of you?  
Shall I really never hear your voice again?  
Alas! Alas! Alas!"</span>

</div>

The Mosquito Indians were at the time of Columbus’ Fourth voyage about
the most uncivilized people in Central America. Originally from the
wooded lowlands of South America they still have ceremonies which point
to their first home.

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

The Tupi, of the lower Amazon and the coast of Brazil, have long had a
reputation for poetic compositions especially among the French. This may
date from 1550 when a large band of Tupi Indians took part in a festival
at Rouen. In 1557 Jean de Lery recorded during voyage in Brazil several
fragments of songs which had impressed him deeply. Much later the
eminent Montaigne was provided with a few examples of Tupi songs by a
man who had spent several years among these Indians, and was moved to
declare that the verses were worthy of Anacreon.

Couto de Magalhães publishes the text and translation of two Tupi songs
which are clearly love charms. One is addressed to Ruda who figures in
the myths of the Tupi as a warrior residing in the clouds. He creates an
amorous melancholy in the hearts of men, making them return home from
long canoe trips. The song is translatable about as follows <span
id="fr_37"></span>[38](sot56.htm#fn_37.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">O Ruda, O Ruda,  
Thou who art in the skies  
And who lovest the rains,  
Make it so that he,  
No matter how many women he has  
Will think them all ugly.  
Make him remember me  
This afternoon  
When the sun gets in the west.</span>

</div>

Another song, addressed to the Moon, also must be regarded as a magical
prayer rather than a mere outpouring of emotion. It takes this form:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">New Moon, Oh, New Moon  
Remind that man of me!  
Here am I in your presence;  
Cause it to be that only  
I Shall occupy his heart.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

The Brazilian ethnologist of half a century ago was quick to realize
that many pieces in the Tupi language were nevertheless inspired by
Portuguese models. He went so far as to demonstrate how, even in these
secondhand compositions, there was a definite deterioration. Portuguese
words replaced Indian ones until, finally, only a few meaningless
syllables of the original Indian phrases were retained as a refrain. He
might have gone farther and shown, how, in the breakdown of the truly
Indian mode, magical prayers are replaced by sentimental praises.

##### DEATH AND ITS MYSTERY

Not all Indian songs about death are mourning songs; perhaps the most
remarkable and beautiful ones are songs in which the dead reappear in
dreams. Mourning songs are common enough among some tribes while among
others they are eliminated by the taboo which forbids mention of a dead
person's name. When permissible they have a somewhat broader appeal than
love songs. The latter are, or should be, a private matter between two
lovers while the former are a family or clan matter which often touches
the entire community. The theme of communal loss is struck in the
beginning lines of a Tlingit dirge <span
id="fr_38"></span>[39](sot56.htm#fn_38.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The nation's canoe is drifting ashore with him  
My uncle is already dead . . .</span>

</div>

Another one, following Swanton's text, deals with the all-encompassing
mystery <span id="fr_39"></span>[40](sot56.htm#fn_39.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I always think within myself  
There is no place where people do not die.  
I do not know where my uncle is:  
Down into the spirits’ cave around the world  
The spirits threw my uncle.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

More poignant and less philosophical are the ending lines of a woman's
song about her drowned brother <span
id="fr_40"></span>[41](sot56.htm#fn_40.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Perhaps he went into the sun's trail  
So that I can never see him again.</span>

</div>

I quote a mourning song of the Kwakiutl relating to a certain Moda’ena,
member of the Cannibal Society, who was drowned with his sister. It was
sung at his house by all the people of his village <span
id="fr_41"></span>[42](sot56.htm#fn_41.md).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">*Ye he he ya!*  
It deprived me of my mind when the moon went down at the edge of the
waters.  
*Ye he he ya!* *Ye he he ya!*  
It deprived me of my breath when the mouse-dancer began to gnaw on the
water.  
*Ye he he ya!* *Ye he he ya!*  
It deprived me of my mind when Moda'ena began to utter the cannibal-cry
on the water.  
*Ye he he ya!*</span>

</div>

From the icy shores of Greenland comes an Eskimo song, translated by
Thalbitzer, which voices the pretense that death is a new thing and not
so bad at that <span id="fr_42"></span>[43](sot56.htm#fn_42.md).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">People have begun a new custom.  
People die now at intervals,  
Chopping out the little step,  
People die at intervals,  
After they have stepped through their heavy troubles.</span>

</div>

The Papago believe that the dead return in dreams and teach curing
songs. Many spiritualistic pieces are accredited to definite individuals
and it is said that the dreams in which the songs were received usually
took place immediately after death although in some cases months or even
years elapsed before the spirit of the

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

dead person returned to deliver his vital message. Some of the most
striking songs seem to picture the last thoughts or, more daringly
still, the flight of the soul. I give several examples in the fine
renderings of Frances Densmore <span
id="fr_43"></span>[44](sot56.htm#fn_43.md)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">In the great night my heart will go out,  
Towards me the darkness comes rattling,  
In the great night my heart will go out.  
                 \*    \*    \*    \*    \*  
A low range of mountains, towards them I am running  
From the top of these mountains I will see the dawn.  
                 \*    \*    \*    \*    \*  
I am dead here, I die and lie here,  
I am dead here, I die and lie here  
Over the top of Vihunput I had my dawn.</span>

</div>

One gathers that elegies were common in ancient Mexico and in ancient
Peru as well. This is natural enough in regions where aristocracy was
recognized.

##### VOCATIONAL SONGS

Purely vocational songs are relatively unimportant in American Indian
poetry partly because nearly every vocation is drawn into the ceremonial
or religious field. There are paddling songs in the Far North while in
New Mexico and Arizona men often sing to the scraping of hand stones
while the women grind corn. More widespread still are gambling songs.
Washington Matthews gives some of the songs used in connection with the
moccasin game of the Navaho, played at night in the winter time. There
are many animal songs, mostly derisive in character, the following
ground squirrel song being typical <span
id="fr_44"></span>[45](sot56.htm#fn_44.md)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The squirrel in his shirt stands up there,  
The squirrel in his shirt stands up there;  
Slender, he stands up there; striped he stands up there.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

The playing is terminated at the first streak of day when the magpie
song is sung <span id="fr_45"></span>[46](sot56.htm#fn_45.md).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The magpie! The magpie! Here underneath  
In the white of his wings on the footsteps of morning.  
It dawns! It dawns!</span>

</div>

Perhaps under vocational songs it would be well to place the curing
songs of medicine men. Most of these are dream songs, however, or follow
the pattern of songs used in magic.

##### SONGS OF SEQUENCE

Songs of sequence is a term applied to sets of songs dealing with the
same theme and following each other in a definite traditional order.
Long ceremonies having such songs are especially developed in the
Southwest whence the idea seems to have spread rather widely over the
Plains and into some parts of California but without the same richness
of detail as in the place of origin. The Mountain Chant of the Navaho
has thirteen sets comprising 161 songs, the greatest number in a
sequence being 26 and the lowest seven. Says Washington Matthews <span
id="fr_46"></span>[47](sot56.htm#fn_46.md):

But how does the shaman remember the order of these songs of sequence?
Does he possess any mnemonic key? He does. There is a myth for each set
of songs, and this myth is the key. The song myths of this tribe are
very numerous, and few songs except extemporaneous compositions, exist
independently of a myth. In some instances the myth is the more
important part of the work, and we are impressed with the idea that the
myth maker composed his story first, and introduced his songs afterwards
as embellishments; but in more cases the myth is a trifling element, and
seems devised merely as an aid to the memory or as a means of explaining
or giving interest to the songs.

I give an example from the myth of the Mountain Chant of the Navahos to
show the relation of prose and poetry <span
id="fr_47"></span>[48](sot56.htm#fn_47.md):

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The clouds hung over the mountain, the showers of rain fell down its
sides, and all the country looked beautiful. And he said to the land
"Aqalàni!" (greeting) and a feeling of loneliness and homesickness swept
over him, and he wept and sang this song:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

That flowing water! That flowing water!  
My mind wanders across it.  
That broad water, that flowing water!  
My mind wanders across it.  
That old age water, that flowing water!  
My mind wanders across it.

</div>

</div>

</div>

The First and Twelfth Song of the Thunder in the Mountain Chant are
translated by Matthews as follows <span
id="fr_48"></span>[49](sot56.htm#fn_48.md). They show an artful use of
repetitions and parallel constructions.

*First Song of the Thunder*

I

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Thonah! Thonah! There is a voice above,  
The voice of the thunder.  
Within the dark cloud,  
Again and again it sounds,  
Thonah! Thonah!</span>

</div>

II

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Thonah! Thonah! There is a voice below,  
The voice of the grasshopper.  
Among the plants,  
Again and again it sounds,  
Thonah! Thonah!</span>

</div>

*Twelfth Song of the Thunder*

I

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The voice that beautifies the land! The voice
above,  
The voice of the thunder  
Within the dark cloud  
Again and again it sounds,  
The voice that beautifies the land.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

II

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The voice that beautifies the land!  
The voice below;  
The voice of the grasshopper  
Among the plants  
Again and again it sounds,  
The voice that beautifies the land.</span>

</div>

The Night Chant by the same author is an even more monumental handling
of the songs of sequence in a great curing ceremony of the Navaho. Here
there are twenty four sequences with a total of 324 songs, strung like
beads upon strings. Again we find the parallel constructions which seem
to produce stanzas, as in the Last Song in the Rock <span
id="fr_49"></span>[50](sot56.htm#fn_49.md).

I

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">At the Red Rock House it grows,  
There the giant corn-plant grows,  
With ears on either side it grows,  
With its ruddy silk it grows,  
Ripening in a day it grows,  
Greatly multiplying grows.</span>

</div>

II

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">At Blue Water House it grows,  
There the giant squash-vine grows,  
With fruit on either side it grows,  
With its yellow blossom grows,  
Ripening in one night it grows,  
Greatly multiplying grows.</span>

</div>

Next we have a song to Nayenezgani in two stanzas <span
id="fr_50"></span>[51](sot56.htm#fn_50.md).

I

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The Slayer of the Alien Gods,  
That now am I.  
The Bearer of the Sun  
Arises with me,  
Journeys with me,  
Goes down with me,  
Abides with me;  
But sees me not.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

II

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The Child of the Water,  
That now am I.  
The Bearer of the Moon

But sees me not.</span>

</div>

A second pair of poems to the same personage:

I

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I am the Slayer of the Alien Gods.  
Where’er I roam,  
Before me  
Forests white are strewn around.  
The lightning scatters;  
But ’tis I who cause it.</span>

</div>

II

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I am the Child of the Water.  
[Where’er](errata.htm#1.md) I roam,  
Behind me  
Waters white are strewn around,  
The tempest scatters;  
But ’tis I who cause it.</span>

</div>

While a third concerns the bluebird <span
id="fr_51"></span>[52](sot56.htm#fn_51.md):

I

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

He has a voice, he has a voice.  
Just at daylight Sialia calls.  
The bluebird has a voice,  
He has a voice, his voice melodious,  
His voice melodious, that flows in gladness.  
Sialia calls, Sialia calls.

</div>

II

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

He has a voice, he has a voice.  
Just at twilight Sialia calls.  
The bird tsolgali has a voice.  
He has a voice, his voice melodious,  
His voice melodious, that flows in gladness  
Sialia calls, Sialia calls.

</div>

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

Also in this ceremony there are songs and prayers in which repetitions
are made in accordance with colors, plants, and so forth, assigned to
the four directions.

If the formal use of songs of sequence, as the first stage in ceremonial
consolidations, extended across Mexico and down into South America no
satisfactory evidence exists at the present time. F.P. and A.P. Penard
report from Surinam that the Caribs have songs which are the *aula* or
"word" of various spiritual beings. These may well belong in such a
category. The word of the Snake Spirit they give in parts <span
id="fr_52"></span>[53](sot56.htm#fn_52.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I am the force of the spirit of the lightning eel,
the thunder axe, the stone.  
I am the force of the fire fly; thunder and lightning have I
created.</span>

</div>

The word of the Thunder they give entire:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I am the thunder, the terror of the earth reflects
my one-ness.  
The earth I do vibrate, I the Thunder.  
All flesh fears, that reflects the one-ness of the Thunder.  
I pass along my field.  
With swiftness all must clear the way.  
The lightning precedes me.  
The thunder-axe I have made, I the Thunder.</span>

</div>

##### REVIVALIST VERSES OF THE GHOST DANCE RELIGION

The Ghost Dance Religion was a rather recent and most startling
manifestation of Indian mass psychology, producing much fine poetry
during the brief span of its existence as an organized cult. It was the
united answer of the wilder tribes of the western states to alien
aggressions which had destroyed the economies of Indian existence but
had not yet completely broken the Indian morale. The new religion rested
upon ancient fundamentals, upon ideas of coersive magic expressed in the
forms of art. It attempted to reapply these ideas, as it

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

were, to the violently new conditions of life. Perhaps it drew something
from Christianity.

There were two cycles in the spread of the Ghost Dance Religion. The
cult began either in western Nevada or eastern Washington about 1870 and
the first expansion was towards the west. The originator of the movement
is generally stated to have been a certain Tävibo, a minor chieftain of
the Paiute tribe in the Walker Lake region, largely because he was the
reputed father of Wovoka, hailed twenty years later as the Indian
Messiah when the rejuvenated Ghost Dance was sweeping eastward over the
Great Plains. But the evidence concerning the part that Smohalla, a
medicine man living near Priest's Rapids on the Columbia River, played
in the formation of the cult is more explicit and of earlier date than
that of Tävibo.

The Indian office took notice of Smohalla in 1870, although the
following clear statement of his beliefs is not so early <span
id="fr_53"></span>[54](sot56.htm#fn_53.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">They have a new and peculiar religion, by the
doctrines of which they are taught that a new god is coming to their
rescue; that all the Indians who have died heretofore, and who shall die
hereafter, are to be resurrected; that as they will then be very
numerous and powerful, they will be able to conquer the whites, recover
their lands, and live as free and unrestrained as their fathers lived in
olden times.</span>

</div>

This was still the essence of the Ghost Dance Religion when it swept the
Plains in 1890 but along the Columbia it was always referred to as the
Dreamer Religion. The credo from the lips of Smohalla himself was taken
down in 1884 by Major MacMurray who had been commissioned to persuade
the Indians to take up homesteads and abandon their free life <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](sot56.htm#fn_54.md).

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">You ask me to plow the ground! Shall I take a knife
and tear my mother's bosom? Then when I die she will not take me to her
bosom to rest.  
You ask me to dig for stone! Shall I dig under her skin for her bones?
Then when I die I cannot enter her body to be born again.  
You ask me to cut my hay and sell it, and be rich like the white men!
But how dare I cut off my mother's hair? . . .  
All the dead men will come to life again. Their spirits will return to
their bodies again. We must wait here in the homes of our fathers and be
ready to meet them in the bosom of our mother.</span>

</div>

But Smohalla is said to have begun preaching "his peculiar theology"
about 1850 and to have been instrumental in consolidating the western
Shahaptin tribes in the Yakima war of 1855–56. If the story is true that
he made a great pilgrimage down the Pacific coast to Mexico about 1860
and returned to his own people by way of Arizona and Nevada, he must, I
think, be given the credit for spreading the seeds of the Ghost Dance
Religion.

Both the first and second stages of the Ghost Dance Religion responded
to a psychology of protest against an overwhelming material power.
Smohalla's teachings were the result of aggressions which came thick and
fast after the Nez Percé had extended an invitation to Spaulding,
Whitman and their fellow zealots to preach at Lapwai and other missions.
For other white men came to trade, to settle and to seek gold. The Modoc
War of 1873–74 and the Nez Percé war of 1877 were the result of wrongs
and coercions by the whites but perhaps the Indians found spiritual aid
in their new religion.

Unfortunately there is a dearth of recorded songs of an early Ghost
Dance type unless we imagine that unmodified Guardian Spirit songs were
in use. If Kroeber is correct in stating that the first spread of the
cult into California in the early ‘70's gave immunity against its

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

second spread in the late ‘80's then the following piece from the Yokuts
may be old, although I suspect it really belongs to the second epoch.
The song was received in a dream by a shaman named Mayemai from his
father <span id="fr_55"></span>[56](sot56.htm#fn_55.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Listen to me  
Mayemai!  
There in the east I shall emerge  
Twirling  
My hand feathers.</span>

</div>

The second stage began with revelation of Wovoka when he was ill with
fever during an eclipse of the sun. "When the sun died," he said, "I
went up to heaven and saw God and all the people who had died a long
time ago." He was hailed as a Messiah largely because the economic
condition of all the tribes who had lived on the buffalo was then
desperate.

The destruction of the great buffalo herds—millions of valuable food
animals being slaughtered for petty profit on their hides alone within
the space of four years (1880–84) by the whites—illustrates how
inevitable was the clash between two philosophical systems of man's
relation to nature. The Indian has ever abjured the waste of natural
bounty and his religion has sought to give thanks for this bounty and at
the same time assure its continuance. The white man's civilization, on
the other hand, has most unwisely subordinated the conservation of
public wealth to the acquisition of private wealth. A rapid exploitation
and liquidation of natural resources in all parts of the world is now
being carried on by the dominant white nations threatening the
exhaustion of many materials. But if the Indian idea that nature is
benevolent be a naive untruth then the white man's idea that nature is
inexhaustible is just as naïvely untrue

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

and much more menacing to the future welfare of mankind.

The Ghost Dance Religion in its second phase spread out from the Paiute
tribe and the earliest and simplest songs must therefore be sought
there. Mooney, in preparing for his sympathetic study of the Ghost
Dance, was able to secure but nine Paiute songs. Reduced to their
briefest statements these sacred pieces are but two lines long. Always
there are repetitions, however, which enlarge this briefest length. The
first song refers to the open dance place in the dead of winter with the
stars overhead. The Milky Way among American Indian tribes is the Spirit
Road or the Pathway of Dead Warriors <span
id="fr_56"></span>[57](sot56.htm#fn_56.md).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The snow lies there, *ro-ra-ni!*  
The snow lies there, *ro-ra-ni!*  
The snow lies there, *ro-ra-ni!*  
The snow lies there, *ro-ra-ni!*  
The Milky Way lies there.  
The Milky Way lies there.</span>

</div>

Then come simple invocations to elemental forces. In one song the line
''the wind stirs the willows" is repeated thrice and "the wind stirs the
grasses" is also repeated thrice. Another invocation goes:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Fog! Fog!  
Lightning! Lightning!  
Whirlwind! Whirlwind!</span>

</div>

The change is coming like a great storm and is pictured by the simplest
but most powerful words, the songs rising to a climax.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The whirlwind! The whirlwind!

Then, after the storm has passed, comes a picture of spring, implying
the happy ending of the cataclysmic change.

Among other tribes who took the Ghost Dance ceremonial from the Paiute
the songs are generally more elaborate. Repetition still serves to give
a strange form to some of the songs, but as a rule one restatement is
deemed sufficient. The subject matter becomes more specific with
references to the Crow, the Eagle or Thunderbird, the Buffalo, etc., as
well as to psychic experiences in meeting the dead.

Mooney gives 73 songs for the Arapaho tribe, most of them based on
individual dreams and resembling the old time Guardian Spirit songs. But
they often refer to encounters in the spirit world with dead friends at
which games were played over and happy hunts were renewed. And there are
some pieces which advance the argument in other ways. For instance, the
following

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

song tells how the father will withdraw his favors from the whites and
give them again to his red children <span
id="fr_57"></span>[58](sot56.htm#fn_57.md).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">My children, when at first I liked the whites,

Then there are sudden turns from ecstasy to pathos.

Next to the end comes a song to the Morning Star.

##### HISTORICAL POEMS APPROACH THE EPIC

Poems which deal with historical characters or events were rather common
in ancient America and some of them approach the epic as giving
extensive narratives lighted by nationalistic ideals. For instance among
our northern Indians there are such pieces as the *Walum Olum* or *Red
Score* of the Delaware which presents historical traditions reaching
back several centuries and has

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

some passages of literary merit. Then there is the Iroquois *Book of
Rites* which memorializes the Great League, a consolidation of related
tribes following the breakdown of the Mound Builder civilization. This
wide-spread calamity may have been brought about by the introduction of
European epidemic diseases after the voyage of Columbus. The Great
League rested on the teachings of Hiawatha for its ethical features
while its legal form was evolved in council and over much opposition.
The Book of Rites, composed long after the events, is essentially a
recitation broken by occasional hymns and dirges. Perhaps the most
notable is a summary which in poetic form is arranged as follows by
Hale <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](sot56.htm#fn_58.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Woe! Woe! Hearken ye!  
We are diminished!  
Woe! Woe!  
The cleared land has become a thicket  
Woe! Woe!  
The clear places are deserted.  
Woe!  
They are in their graves—  
They who established it—  
Woe!  
The Great League,  
Yet they declared  
It should endure—  
The Great League  
Woe!  
Their work has grown old.  
Woe!  
Thus we are become miserable.</span>

Probably the oldest fragments of New World literature are laments for
the great Toltec captains of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries <span
id="fr_59"></span>[60](sot56.htm#fn_59.md). The best preserved hymn refers
to the rise of the Toltec power in Yucatan and its fall in the valley of
Mexico, corresponding to the winning of the Maya city of Chichen Itza by
Nacxitl-Quetzalcoatl

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

in 1191 and the abandonment of Teotihuacan by Matlaxochitl and other
Toltec lords in 1220 A.D.

*A Toltec Lament*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Here begins the kettle-drum hymn  
Tico, tico, toco, toto, and the hymn ends  
With tiquiti, titi, to titi.  
In Tollan, alas! stood the House of Beams,  
Where still the serpent columns stand.  
But Nacxitl, our noble lord, has departed,  
He has gone into the far country.  
(Already our lamented princes have departed!)  
And there in the Red Land he is undone.  
In Cholula we were when we set forth  
For Poyautecatitlan to cross the water in boats:  
The wept for ones have departed!  
I have come to the foreign boundaries  
I, Ihuiquecholli, I, Mamaliteuchtli:  
I am sad for my lord Ihuitimalli is gone.  
He deserts me, I who am Matlacxochitl.  
Weep, weep! O, weep, weep, weep!  
That the mountains tumbled, I wept  
That the sea rose up in dust, I lamented,  
Wailing that he, my lord, had gone.  
In the Red Land, alas! thou art awaited  
And there thou art bidden to sleep!  
O only weep, weep!  
Thou hast already set forth my lord Ihuitimalli,

Alas and nevermore! Weep, weep!  
Thy house will remain forever, thy palace  
Carried across the sea will always stay.  
Thou hast left Tollan of the boundaries  
Desolate here, weep, ah weep!  
Without ceasing that lord, that Timallo wept:  
Thy house will remain forever.  
Thou first didst paint the stone and wood in Tollan  
There where thou earnest to rule, Nacxitl our noble lord!  
Never will thy name be forgotten,  
Always will thy people mourn thee, bewail thee!

Thou alone didst set it up in Tollan,  
There where thou earnest to rule, Nacxitl our noble Lord!</span>

The Maya Prophecies of the Katuns contain some references to early times
since they are arranged in cycles of 13 katuns of 7200 days each
according to the idea that events repeat themselves. These prophecies
are constructed in the form of chants. The Prophesy of Katun 9 Ahau,
covering events from 1556 to 1575 belongs to the era of persecution
under the Spanish Inquisition. History furnishes few more telling
indictments directed at their conquerors by a conquered people than this
outcry of the disillusioned Mayas. I make three slight changes in Roys’
translation <span id="fr_60"></span>[61](sot56.htm#fn_60.md) of the latter
part of this prophesy although aware that more extensive re-phrasing
would emphasize the poetic character of the satirical statement.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Then began the building of the church  
Here in the center of Tihoo:

No epics pure and simple have survived from ancient America but there
are epic-like compositions. The Cakchiquels of Guatamala have an Odyssey
which tells how people under valiant leaders set out from Tollan,
overcoming natural and supernatural difficulties. Most of this tribal
narrative displays a poetic imagery and some of it a distinctly poetic
form. If this be history then it is history in a cosmogonic setting with
heroes who bulk large in a twilight of the gods. An early passage is
about as follows <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](sot56.htm#fn_61.md):

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

And soon the divination began with them. A bird called the guard of the
ravine began to complain within the gate of Tollan as we were going
forth from Tollan.

"You shall die, you shall be lost, I am your portent," said this brute
to us. "Do you not believe me? Truly your state shall be a sad one."
Thus spake to us this brute as is related.

Then another bird called the owl, seated on a red tree, complained and
said thus: "I am your portent," he said. "You are not our portent,
although you would like to be." we answered this owl. Such were the
messengers who gave them their idols said our fathers, our ancestors of
old.

Then another bird called the parroquet complained in the sky and said:
"I am your portent, you shall die." But we said to the brute, "Do not
speak thus: you are but the sign of spring. You wail first when it is
spring; when the rain ceases, you wail." Thus we spoke to him.

</div>

Even more remarkable is the Popul Vuh or Sacred Book of the Quiché tribe
for here there is, as Alexander points out, "the element of critical
consciousness, giving the flavor of philosophical reflection." The
recital of Creation resembles that of the Bible, nevertheless we cannot
be sure that it is not a pagan parallel.

The self-glorification motive is put to scorn in a passage of the Popul
Vuh which relates the unkingly end of a certain Vukub-Cakix. He was
perhaps a Toltec overlord who hoped to lead the Quiché to the light in a
cultural sense <span id="fr_62"></span>[63](sot56.htm#fn_62.md)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I will be their sun, I will be their light, I will
be the moon to illumine them . . .  
For of silver are the balls of my eyes and their sockets are set with
resplendent jade; my teeth shine like precious stones, like the clarity
of heaven . . .  
In this manner, then, I am the sun and the moon, the cause that
civilizes and makes wise the sons and daughters of the land.  
So spake Vukub-Cakix. But really he was not the sun, and it was only the
pride of plumes and metallic glitterings that make him speak
thus.</span>

</div>

Next it is explained how two young heroes despoiled Vukub-Cakix of his
glory by pulling his teeth!

No examples of pre-Columbian drama have come down to us, but there are
references enough to plays and pageants. Father Coto says of the
Cakchiquel: "They are friendly to making colloquies and speaking verses
in their dramas." At Copan we find theater-like constructions and at
Chichen Itza there are platforms upon which it is presumed dramas were
enacted. Several post-Columbian plays after the European religious
models have been reported in Central America while from eighteenth
century Peru comes the famous drama of Ollanta. It shows no traces of
pre-Spanish poetic style and seems to have been modelled directly upon a
mediocre European work. While agreeing with Hills <span
id="fr_63"></span>[64](sot56.htm#fn_63.md) that it has little intrinsic
merit, I certainly cannot agree with him when he says "Ollanta is the
most important literary work that has been composed in any language
indigenous to America." Rather its European reception was a reflection
of Victorian taste.

##### STYLE IN OLD AMERICAN LITERATURE

Hundreds of mutually unintelligible languages are spoken by natives of
the New World and even if most of the consolidations suggested by
scientific linguists hold true, there must remain fifty or more
unrelated linguistic stocks. For practical purposes each strongly
defined language is an independent analysis—the terms of which exist
only in the group mind—of all the material facts, actions, mental states
and social conventions in settings of time and space, of which the
members of the group are conscious, and concerning which they wish to
exchange communications.

Language, like any other social tool, refines itself

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

through use and takes on appreciated characters of ease and beauty. The
deliberate application of the more precise and pleasing ways of
communicating thought everywhere gives rise to high style and fine art.
Style is so intimately involved in the organic possibilities of a
particular language that it cannot, properly speaking, be translated
except in so far as it concerns the sequence and arrangements of
materials. It can be matched in general effect, and that is about all.
In translating poetry, then, the thought and the emotional environment
of the thought, can be restated but not the poetic style *per se*.

But, it seems that ideas, quite aside from the streams of sound which
impart them, may have absolute distinction, crystalline simplicity and
other gem qualities. Ideas can be looked upon as arrangements of thought
stimuli and sometimes a single simile, which we call poetic, may hold a
vital comparison or imagery capable of passing freely across the
frontiers of speech. It is style of thought rather than style of words
which principally concerns the translator.

Indeed, it is difficult enough even to define style in any particular
language. Speaking of the esthetic character of Mohave myths Kroeber
says in one place <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](sot56.htm#fn_64.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">We are thus face to face with a style of literature
which is as frankly decorative as a patterned textile. The pattern is
far from random; but it is its color and intricacy, its fineness and
splendor, that have meaning, not the action told by its figures.</span>

</div>

In another place the same writer speaks more broadly <span
id="fr_65"></span>[66](sot56.htm#fn_65.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">For centuries hundreds of thousands of human beings
have been forming a style, a variety of styles, according to</span>

</div>

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

nation and occasion, in which they expressed some of their profoundest
feelings; and we cannot make a single exact and intelligible remark
about their accomplishments.

It is of course true that we cannot judge style in the Redman's use of
words except in so far as it is discernible in concentration or
picturesqueness of thought above the mill-run of ordinary speech and in
unusual rhythmic effects and balanced logical constructions. Among the
Tewa, for instance, the poetic style is much more concentrated than the
colloquial one and it contains "high words" and ceremonial phrases.
Sahagun complained that Aztec poems and religious chants were esoteric
to a degree. "They were composed," he says, "with such deceit that they
proclaim only what the demon demands." When, however, an Aztec poet uses
such a phrase as "I, the singer, polished my noble, new song like
shining jade" we may be assured that style had passed out of the stage
of natural selections and into the stage of purposeful cultivation.

The device of rhyme seems not to have been used by the most cultivated
Americans of pre-Columbian times, although some interesting uses of it
are found in post-Columbian poems from Peru. Nor were there any certain
stanza forms except such as were brought about by the repetition of
phrases. The outstanding feature of American Indian verse construction
comes from parallel phrasing, or, let us say, repetition with an
increment, which gives an effect not of rhyming sounds but of rhyming
thoughts. Sometimes the ceremonial pattern demands a repetition for each
world direction with formal changes involving the color, plant, animal,
and so forth, associated with each station on the circuit. But there are
other manifestations of parallelism of a more subtle cast. For instance,
the Osage ritualist threads the labyrinth

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

of apparent fact to reach ultimate truth in the Little House of Mystery
in the following parallels <span
id="fr_66"></span>[67](sot56.htm#fn_66.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Towards what shall they direct their footsteps as they travel the path
of life? They said, as has been said, in this house.

*It is toward four little valleys that they shall direct their footsteps
as they travel the path of life*.

Verily, it is not four little valleys that is meant.  
*It is towards four herds of animals that they shall direct their
footsteps as they travel the path of life*.

Verily, it is not four herds of animals that is meant.  
*It is the little house toward which they shall direct their footsteps
as they travel the path of life!*

</div>

I have explained how poetry is racked upon musical frames and how it
develops artistically out of what survives with least mutilation from
the bed of Procrustes. While rhythm might conceivably arise as an
absolute esthetic invention, actually in American poetry it is induced
by drummings and other pulsations. "The rhythmic sense of primitive
people," says Franz Boas <span id="fr_67"></span>[68](sot56.htm#fn_67.md),
"is much more highly developed than our own." He adds: "It requires
careful study to understand the structure of primitive rhythm, more so
in prose than in song because in this case the help of the melodic
pattern is lacking." Here rhythm is conceived as a complex undulation in
spoken or chanted words which represents ease and is capable of
producing an effect of pleasure. But I think a close analogy holds
between the esthetics of poetic diction superimposed on music and the
esthetics of decorative art superimposed on a textile fabric. In both
cases there is a regulating order which reveals the certain road to
beauty.

Many figures of speech and circumlocutions have their origin in the uses
of religion, and perhaps we might

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

say that the emotional enlargement of religious concepts gives the poet
his first opportunity. Aztec ceremonies, grim and grisly with human
sacrifice, albeit spectacular and dramatic to the last degree, gained
little from the plastic art of the sculptor but much from the
euphemistic phrasing of the singer. The latter was able to disclose the
hidden spirituality and sincerity of acts, which judged out of their
context, could only arouse the sensation of cruel horror.

Take, for example, the Aztec hymn to Xipe Totec, Lord of the Flayed, a
foreign god who acquired a wide vogue among Mexican tribes. His ritual
challenged all others in the sheer achievement of grewsomeness. But
except for the opening passage the hymn addressed to this god deals with
returning springtime and the green of corn fields which must be brought
to maturity <span id="fr_68"></span>[69](sot56.htm#fn_68.md)

*Song to Xipe Totec, Lord of the Flayed*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Thou Night-toper, who so bashful?  
Then don thy masquerade,  
The golden raiment, put it on!

Let thy jade waters descend, my Lord:  
To green plumes the cypress turns,  
To green plumes the fire-snake turns,  
And the season of hunger leaves me.

Perhaps I shall be stricken  
Upon the ground, I, the young maize stem.  
My heart is like jade but I would  
It were golden. Joyous! when first  
It is ripe and the war-chief born!

With a plenteous maize field, my Lord,  
Thy worshipper looks to thy mountain  
And thee! Joyous! when first  
It is ripe and the war-chief born!

</div>

There are phrases here which may seem somewhat cryptic. The golden
raiment is, of course, the skin of the

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

flayed victim. In the second verse the fire serpent of the dry season
changes to the feathered serpent of the rainy season.

More occult still is the hymn addressed to the Fire God of the Aztecs,
here called the Yellow-faced One but also known as the Turquoise Lord.

*Song of the Yellow faced Ones*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

In Tzommolco, my fathers, shall I affront you?  
In Tetemocan shall I affront you?

In the House of Music, oh my Lords, the yucca tree booms  
In the House of Disguises the masquerade has come down.

In Tzommolco they have begun to sing;  
In Tzommolco they have begun to sing.  
Why come they not hither,  
Why come they not hither?

In Tzommolco human beings shall he given,  
The Sun has come up!  
Human beings shall be given.

In Tzommolco now ceases the song,  
Without effort he has grown rich, to lordship he has attained,  
It is miraculous his being pardoned.

Oh, little woman utter the speech,  
Lady of the House of Mist, utter the speech abroad!

</div>

His priests prepare a sacrifice to the Sun in Tzommolco, a temple in the
ward of the travelling merchants in ancient Mexico City (Tenochtitlan).
In the House of Music the shell trumpets and the drums were kept: "the
yucca tree booms'' refers to the latter, for the hollow log drums of the
Aztecs were commonly made of this wood. At the conclusion of the human
sacrifice to the rising Sun the offerer of the ceremony receives his
reward in wealth and honors. These the Sun has power to convey while a
mountain goddess of the morning mist broadcasts his action.

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

Concentration of thought reached its peak in the monosyllabic language
of the Mayas. The original text of the Maya chant printed below has 90
syllables, while Brinton's English rendering contains 118 syllables or
thirty per-cent more <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](sot56.htm#fn_69.md). But
English is itself a speech which excels in brevity.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Eat, eat, while there is bread,  
Drink, drink while there is water;  
A day comes when dust shall darken the air  
When a blight shall wither the land,  
When a cloud shall arise,  
When a mountain shall be lifted up,  
When a strong man shall seize the city,  
When ruin shall fall upon all things,  
When the tender leaf shall be destroyed,  
When eyes shall be closed in death;  
When there shall be three signs on a tree,  
Father, son and grandson hanging dead on the same tree;  
When the battle flag shall be raised,  
And the people scattered abroad in the forest.</span>

</div>

The one thing that remained to be developed in the poetic expression of
the American Indian was the individual point of view. But perhaps the
world is richer by reason of this lack which leaves the social mode
uncompromised.

##### ON TRANSLATING INDIAN POETRY

It is perhaps inevitable that many translators of Indian poems should
color, or discolor, primitive ideas with civilized conventions, and this
without any intention to deceive. Often their renderings depart so
widely from the original texts—as ethnologists know the sense of them—as
to leave nothing that is validly Indian, especially when rhyme or
warping verse forms are employed. It is well, therefore, to consider the
translator's handicap, and also to establish standards of success.

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

First of all it must be admitted that some pieces are falsely called
Indian, being actually nothing more than compositions by whites in what
is fondly believed to be a savage mode. The Taensa songs perpetrated by
Parisot in a fabricated language were an elaborate fraud but most
writers of spurious Indian songs do not bother with native texts.

Longfellow's *Song of Hiawatha* is not itself a translation but it has
affected translations. It is essentially a literary creation in a
peculiar style which the public has come to accept as one befitting
Indian materials. Longfellow had before him only Schoolcroft's stilted
transcriptions of a few Indian myths. He did not know that Hiawatha
flourished about 1600 A.D. and was one of the founders of the original
League of the Iroquois. Also he wove into this poem, with its strange
medley of mythological incidents mostly taken from the Ojibwa, a love
theme which joined the Iroquois of New York with the Sioux of far-off
Dakota. He patterned his verse form, with its effective iterations, on
the Scandinavian Eddas. It is irony indeed, that Longfellow's Indian
Edda—to use his own phrase—should be accepted as archetype not only of
Indian expression but also of the Redman's sentiment.

Four great recorders of American Indian poetry have established
standards by which the work of others may be judged. The first and
greatest of these is Bernardino de Sahagun, conservator of the soul of
ancient Mexico. This Spanish priest arrived in Tlaltelolco in 1529, only
eight years after Cortes had taken the nearby capital of the Aztecs. He
devoted a long life to compiling information on the pre-Spanish culture.
The second is Dr. Washington Matthews who served for many years as a
physician on the Navaho Reservation. His lasting monuments

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

are *The Mountain Chant* and *The Night Chant*. The third is Francis La
Flesche, himself an Indian of the Omaha tribe and the best student of
his race. During the last years of his life La Flesche freed himself
from earlier subordinating influences and achieved a great triumph in
recording and translating the sacred chants of the Osage tribe. The
fourth most eminent achievement in the field of primitive American
poetry is that of William Thalbitzer for his thorough study of the songs
of the Ammassalik Eskimo. Although a Dane he exhibits remarkable
felicity of expression in putting Eskimo over into English.

Sahagun recorded the Mexican songs in the Mexican language and in the
same tongue he added glosses to explain symbolic passages in everyday
words. He did not make translations of these pieces into Spanish, which
is fortunate, for had he done so it is highly probable that his
manuscript would have been destroyed. As it was no publication of this
or any other part of his splendid compilation was permitted during his
lifetime for fear that it would keep alive pagan beliefs and practices
which the church was trying to stamp out. The manuscripts lay unnoticed
until the end of the eighteenth century. The part containing the ancient
songs was first translated into English by Brinton under the title of
*Rig Veda Americanus*. A better translation has been made into German by
Seler but it seems that there are archaic expressions which even Sahagun
could not explain in his glosses.

The other writers whose works are to be commended from the double
standard of fidelity to the original sources and artistic quality in the
rendering belong to the school of modern ethnology. They preserve a
golden mean while many other moderns incline to one of two

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

extreme: some give prosaic renderings of poetic texts and some give
poetic renderings which wander so far from originals that they no longer
serve as true indices of Indian mentality. After all translation is the
carrying over of the totality of expressed thought from the terms of one
language to the terms of another.

There is over translation and under translation. Let us consider
examples of each for the purpose of defining somewhat more precisely the
personal equation of the translator. The Hako Ceremony of the Pawnee
possesses dignity and poetic quality of high order and its
interpretation with all covert meanings was an achievement of Alice
Cunningham Fletcher at the turn of the century. She was assisted by
James R. Murie as interpreter and Tabirussawitchi, an elder of the
Pawnee tribe, as interpreter. The songs were recorded by phonograph and
transcribed into scale music. This Hako Ceremony was an elaborate prayer
for children and the welfare of the tribe expressed in symbolical
language and action. The fertility of the earth responding to sun and
rain produces human food and human happiness. The Corn Mother is the
intermediary between man and the cosmic powers.

Admitted that more is meant than the language conveys, nevertheless it
is perhaps unfortunate that the English words used by Miss Fletcher in
her "rhythmic renditions" go so far beyond the Pawnee words.
Implications in regalia, in ceremonial objects and in the pantomime of
dancers may form a running commentary in an Indian ceremony and may have
esoteric significance in accordance with a veritable philosophy of
illusion. But is it wise to enrich the actual text in such fashion as to
bring out the context?

Let me illustrate with the first stanza of a typical song as translated
by Miss Fletcher <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](sot56.htm#fn_70.md):

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Tirâwa harken! mighty one,  
Above us in blue silent sky!  
We standing wait thy bidding here.  
The Mother Corn standing waits,  
Waits to serve thee here;  
The Mother Corn stands waiting here.</span>

</div>

The Pawnee text out of which this stanza is constructed is mostly a
repetition of the simple phrase,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Mother, now I standing, hold.</span>

</div>

How then did Miss Fletcher obtain her opening address to the supreme
deity of the Pawnee and her varied renderings of the other lines? Well
the Corn Mother is an object held in the hand of the performer
consisting of an ear of corn fastened to a stick with a plume at the top
and with the uppermost kernels painted blue. The ear is therefore a
combination of supernatural powers in earth below and heaven above,
since blue is the color of the sky. The feather is a cloud or perhaps
Tirawa. Also, according to Miss Fletcher, the symbolism is continued in
the bowl of sacred blue paint. There is, I suppose, no reason for
doubting that the ceremony as a whole is addressed to Tirawa.
Nevertheless the re-assemblage of these intimations into the specific
phrase:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Tirâwa hearken! mighty one  
Above us in blue silent sky!</span>

</div>

seems to me to go far beyond the proper rights of translation. The
expansion found in this poem is characteristic of the method used for
the entire ceremony with its twenty rituals.

But under translation is also found. For instance, Frank Russell's
translations of Pima songs are a sort of blanc mange which do not do
justice to the material.

Take the Wind Song which he translates as follows in one of his better
renderings <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](sot56.htm#fn_71.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Wind now commences to sing;  
Wind now commences to sing.  
The land stretches before me,  
Before me stretches away.

Wind's house now is thundering;  
Wind's house now is thundering;  
I go roaring o’er the land  
The land covered with thunder.  
Over the windy mountains;

Over the windy mountains,  
Came the myriad legged wind;  
The wind came running hither.  
The Black Snake Wind came to me;  
The Black Snake Wind came to me  
Came and wrapped itself about  
Came here running with its song.

</div>

On the basis of the interlinear words the following is a closer and
certainly more interesting rendering of this piece.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Here the wind begins to sing.  
There before me stretches the land.  
Here the wind begins to sing.  
There before me stretches the land. Begins to sing,  
There before me stretches the land.

Wind-house thunder! wind-house thunder!  
I go there in the thunder-covered land.  
Wind-house thunder! wind-house thunder!  
I go there in the thunder-covered land.  
Wind-house thunder!  
I go there in the thunder-covered land.

Over windy mountain! Over windy mountain!  
Everywhere centipede gusts came running.  
Over windy mountain! Over windy mountain!  
Everywhere centipede gusts came running.  
Over windy mountain!  
Everywhere centipede gusts came running. <span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

Black Snake Wind! Black Snake Wind!  
Here came running in a song, tied up in a song.  
Black Snake Wind! Black Snake Wind!  
Here came running in a song, tied up in a song.  
Black Snake Wind!  
Here came running in a song, tied up in a song.

In their study of *American Indian Poetry* Eda Lou Walton and T. T.
Waterman go into a fuller examination of the discrepancies between
Russell's literal texts and his literary renderings and also call
attention to a Navaho poem doubly translated by Mathews in the *Night
Chant* and by Goddard in *Navaho Myths, Prayers and Songs*, as
poetically very different. But Goddard was able to give considerable
distinction to the words of Apache ceremonies where his work stands
alone. The short songs by Frances Densmore in her numerous papers on
American Indian music are often very fine as are those of Thomas Mooney
in his classical *Ghost Dance Religion*. Ruth Bunzel must certainly be
praised for her handling of Zuñi material, where Frank Hamilton Cushing
and Matilda Coxe Stephenson had preceded her. William Jones has treated
the shamanistic material around the Great Lakes in more delicate fashion
than some other writers. As a rule the professional linguists are
prosaic: it seems that they pay attention merely to structures and to
the denotation of words, neglecting the connotation. It is the old story
of botanists not seeing the beauty of flowers.

##### TEWA POETRY AS A TYPICAL EXHIBIT

In the Southwest the social and spiritual entities of ancient America
have survived to our times but today the more precious elements are
rapidly disintegrating under manifold contacts. The Navaho retain the
traditions of a semi-nomadic life and the Pueblo tribes those

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

of sedentary life reaching back to the times of the Cliff Dwellers. The
ceremonial and artistic life of Zuñi is better known than that of any
other Pueblo group. The other Pueblo groups, including the Hopi
villages, the Keres villages and the Tiwa and Tewa villages have been
indifferently reported upon, mostly by persons whose ceilings—to use an
aeronautic term—are low.

The Tewa constitute a linguistic division of the Tanoan stock and live
in the five villages of Tesuque, Nambe, San Ildefonso, Santa Clara and
San Juan in the Rio Grande valley north and northwest of Santa Fé. They
have been in contact with the white man since the Coronado Expedition
and continuously since 1598 when the Spaniards took up residence across
the river from San Juan of the Gentlemen—except for the interval of the
Pueblo Rebellion (1680–1694). The native culture, always accepting some
ideas from the outside, nevertheless managed to intensify its own
religious and social life. This was the case until the era of railroad
communication when an influx of the whites brought disease and economic
pressure. Despoiled of much of their land and water, and burdened with
tuberculosis and tracoma, the dwindling villages reached a low level
about 1910. Since then there has been some increase in population but
the uses of money have struck at the most sacred institutions from the
inside.

The examples of Tewa poetry presented in this volume were collected in
the years 1909, ‘10, ‘11 and ‘12 while I was engaged in ethnological
field work for the American Museum of Natural History. The songs were
taken down in native texts, with inter-linear translations and then
converted into direct and simple English <span
id="fr_72"></span>[73](sot56.htm#fn_72.md). Fortunately the Tewa language
presents no unusual difficulties in translation.

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

While this collection does not by any means exhaust the repertory of the
Tewa, it does, I believe, furnish examples of all types of poetic
expression in use by them. As regards the secular and esoteric poems the
reader will find material for comparison in the recent study of Ruth
Bunzel entitled Introduction to Zuñi Ceremonialism. There are other
publications which might be mentioned but space does not permit. I close
with an invocation to the Makers of Storms recorded at Zuñi <span
id="fr_73"></span>[74](sot56.htm#fn_73.md).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Cover my earth mother four times with many
flowers.  
Let the heavens be covered with the banked-up clouds.  
Let the earth be covered with fog; cover the earth with rains.  
Great waters, rains, cover the earth. Lightning cover the earth.  
Let thunder be heard over the earth, let thunder be heard;  
Let thunder be heard over the six regions of the earth.</span>
