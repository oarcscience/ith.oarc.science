<p>That somebody, my own special one,<br> Even his shadow and his voice are loved.<br> His foot fall even! But what can I do?<br> That other one, O how I hate his shadow!<br> His shirt is fine and white, his hat is gray,<br> His leggings and his shoes are beaded bright,<br> His neckerchief is gay and yellow&#8212;but<br> For all his clothes, his face, his face is black!</p>
