##### XXXVI

##### SCALP DANCE SONG

Next after comes Coyote, Stretched-Out-in Dew,  
Next after braves of yesterday or the day before!  
To Blue Earth town of the Navahos we go  
And arriving we shall kill. So that is why  
Coyote, Stretched-Out-in Dew, sits straight and ready.  
*Wi-ya-he-na, a-nde-a-a*. The next scalp!

Navajo youths! your fault alone it is  
That now you die fallen along your house.  
Your fault alone it is that now you die  
Fallen along your house with earth-streaked thighs,  
That now your mouths are stopped and streaked with earth.  
*Ho-o-wi-na, a-ye-a-a*. The next scalp!
