### AUTHOR'S PREFACE

THIS LITTLE BOOK VOICES AN APPRECIATION OF THE ETHICS AND IDEALS OF THE
AMERICAN INDIAN AS THESE ARE EXPRESSED IN HIS MOST ENDURING WORDS. I AM
INDEBTED FOR ITS PUBLICATION AT THIS TIME TO THE EXPOSITION OF INDIAN
TRIBAL ARTS INC., AN ORGANIZATION EFFECTED IN 1930 FOR THE PURPOSE OF
PRESENTING THE ART OF THE FIRST AMERICANS AS FINE ART. ASIDE FROM
EXPLANATORY COMMENT THE BOOK STANDS, THEN, AS A SUPPLEMENTAL EXHIBIT OF
THE REDMAN'S AESTHETICS, GIVING EXAMPLES OF WOVEN AND COLORFUL PHRASES
PROPER TO THE SPLENDID COMPANY OF HIS FINE TEXTILES, FINE CERAMICS AND
EXQUISITE SIMPLICITIES IN PAINTING AND SCULPTURE.

NOW WHEN THE WHITE MAN'S INTRODUCED CIVILIZATION FALTERS BEFORE A GLUT
OF FOOD AND A LAPSE OF ETHICS THE OLD AMERICAN CIVILIZATION OF
PRE-COLUMBIAN DAYS HOLDS LESSONS NOT TO BE IGNORED. THE REDMAN'S SOCIAL
RESTRAINTS KEPT THE RESOURCES OF THE NEW WORLD INTACT AGAINST OUR
COMING. HIS DISTINGUISHED SKILL SET UP SOME OF THE BEST STANDARDS OF
CRAFTSMANSHIP. HIS PATIENT HUSBANDRY WON FOR US OUR MOST IMPORTANT
CROPS. BETTER STILL HE DEMONSTRATED THAT UPON A WISE USE OF LEISURE
SAVED FROM THE PURSUIT OF FOOD AND MERE NECESSITIES REST THOSE
INTELLECTUAL, ARTISTIC AND RELIGIOUS COMMONWEALTHS WHICH ARE THE CROWN
AND GLORY OF MANKIND.

AFTER THE MANNER OF ANCIENT AMERICA OUR PRESENT SOCIETY SHOULD FIND AN
INCREASING PROPORTION OF ITS MEMBERS ENGAGED IN CULTURAL EMPLOYMENT. YET
TODAY, SUFFERING FROM TOO MUCH GOOD FORTUNE, WE CURTAIL ART, SCIENCE AND
EDUCATION AND BEND EVERY EFFORT TO STIMULATE A SPENDTHRIFT DESTRUCTION
OF NATURAL WEALTH IN THE NAME OF BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY. OUR INDIANS OF
THE PAST CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OF OUR SOCIAL PURPOSES.
