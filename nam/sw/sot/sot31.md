##### XXVII

##### HOW THE GODS ARE BROUGHT

*A Dramatic Fragment*

<span class="small">Argument: This is the culminating episode of a long
myth which tells how the two Little People, miraculous twins, defeated
the False Priests and established the true rituals. They have been
successful in earlier tests but now comes the supreme test of bringing
the gods into the underground ceremonial lodge. The ritual here
described is used by the K’osa. They blow ashes from the open hand to
imitate a cloud and on this cloud they see the rain gods walking.</span>

*The Twins hold dialogue*

Then they two went to the fireplace, and out of it took handfuls of
ashes.  
And standing where they were one said to the other:  
"Yes, my twin, you go first, you try your magic first!''  
So that one threw the ashes in his hand towards the north.  
And he said: "Nothing at all I see there so next your turn it is to make
magic; and in what direction do you mean, my twin?" he said.  
"Well somewhere towards the east," that one said deceitfully, but really
towards the west he threw his ashes. "Nothing at all I see there,
brother twin.''

*The False Priests make side remarks*

Then the others said to one another. "From where could those two bring
something? Why do they talk so uselessly?"

*The Twins resume*

"Yes, now you try it again, and in what direction, my twin?"

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

"Well, somewhere over there, " he said and made ready to throw towards
the north but really towards the south he threw the ashes. Then he said,
"Nothing at all appears, so next you try again."

*The False Priests make side remarks*

"What can those two bring from anywhere? Just watch how they pretend!
Pretty soon they should be finished off!

*The Twins resume*

Again it is the older twin's turn. "Slowly now you try it, my twin
brother, but in what direction?"  
"Well, somewhere towards the west" and westward he made like to throw
the ashes, but really to the east he threw them.  
"Up yonder," he said, "up yonder at Stone Man Lake the troubled waters
go *tsha’ amä! tsha’a mä! tsha’a mä!*  
"That is what I see and hear, so now quickly, my twin; quickly, my twin;
you must hurry!"  
So next that one threw ashes, "But where," he said, "but where?" and
yonder towards Stone Man. Lake he likewise threw his ashes.  
"Now, my twin, the water moves" he said, "*tsha’amä! tsha’ amä! tsa’
amä!* You said so, yes! but there in the middle of the lake one is
peeping out! I see him! From there now they come out, they come out,
they come out around the edge of the lake! This way and that they walk
about!"

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

"From there now they lift up their fog rainbow and to the north on Fish
Ridge where the ditch-head lies, they rest their fog rain- bow. Now on
the top of it they come to that mountain where the ditch-head lies! They
come, my twin brother! So hurry, twin brother!''  
And next that one threw ashes towards Fish Ridge where the ditch-head
lies. "There they come,'' he said. "From there they lift their fog
rainbow again and on Fish Summit they rest their fog rainbow! Now on top
of it they keep coming!"  
"And now a cloud flower is seated there on Stone Man Mountain top! Now
it thunders hard! a light gleams, the lightning flashes! And now at
Yunge village, the people are seeing it. So now, my twin brother, you
try it."  
And next that one threw ashes towards Fish Summit Lake. "There they have
come, just as you said. From there they lift up their fog rainbow and at
the town on the end of Cedar Face they rest their fog rainbow. Still on
the top of it they keep coming! And now it thunders strongly, hail and
great rain waters fall here at Yunge village!

*The False Priests make side remarks*

Then the others said to one another, "What can those two bring? Even now
they should be made what they will soon be made—universe wanderers in
the void!

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

*Rattle flower Youth and Flint-Corn youth speak*

Then Tini povi enu and Khu mbi enu said "Wait, all of you! Just wait,
all of you!"

*The Twins resume*

"Quickly, my twin," he said to him and threw ashes towards the town at
the end of Cedar Face. "As you said, they come! From there next they
lift their fog rainbow and towards Muddy Water Lake and there at Muddy
Water Lake they rest their fog rainbow and on top of it they keep
coming!"  
And more and more the lightning flashes entered the lodge where they
were sitting as if destruction were coming. And now on the roof of the
lodge the footsteps of the watchers sounded and they entered.  
"Next quickly, my twin brother! There as you said they come to Muddy
Water Lake! and now they lift their fog rainbow to Blue Willow leaf Lake
and rest."  
And then even the houses shook with thunder.

*The False Priests make remarks*

And now those others looked at one another and spoke. "But what can
those two bring?" And though they were seeing, still they were not
believing.

*Battle flower Youth and Flint-Corn Youth speak*

"But wait a little! but wait! You will see what you will see," they
said.

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

*The Twins resume*

"Then quickly" he told him, "my twin brother, they have come to Blue
Willow Leaf Lake, as you say! From there now they lift up their fog
rainbow and here, where the stone gods of Yunge live, they rest their
fog rainbow. Now they come on! Here they come, now!"  
So those two said. And the hail was thrown suddenly into the lodge.  
And the White Corn Girls stood there with baskets of meal ready to give
an offering of food!  
Then quickly he said to his twin brother: "Here in Yunge where the Stone
Gods live you said they were coming. And now they lift their fog rainbow
right to the lodge. At the head of the ladder now they put down their
fog rainbow. Here they come now! Enter! Enter our Old Men Gods!

So now those false ones were walled in by the lightnings. They were
struck by the lightnings and their entrails were riven.
