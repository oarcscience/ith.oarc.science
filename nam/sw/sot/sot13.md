##### IX

##### THE INCONSTANT LOVER

*He speaks*  
Oh, Little Blue, at your door I wish to be,  
At your door that once was blue and open wide,  
But now is closed. At your door, I wish to be  
Oh, my little breath! Oh, my little heart!

*She speaks*  
To Comanche girls you paid those words, those eyes!  
Your wish concerns me not and I can't be blamed  
For that! It was under guns that you dared to pay!
