##### XV

##### A CORN GRINDING SONG OF TESUQUE

There towards the north,  
There the fog is lying,  
There the fog is lying.  
In the middle stands Blue Corn  
Happily, prettily, she is singing  
*Ha-we-ra-na na-a-se*

There towards the west  
There the fog is lying,  
There the fog is lying,  
In the middle stands Yellow Corn  
Happily, prettily, she is singing  
*Ha-we-ra-na na-a-se*

There towards the south  
There the fog is lying,  
There the fog is lying,  
In the middle stands Red Corn  
Happily, prettily, she is singing  
*Ha-we-ra-na na-a-se*

There towards the east  
There the fog is lying,  
There the fog is lying,  
In the middle stands White Corn  
Happily, prettily, she is singing  
*Ha-we-ra-na na-a-se*
