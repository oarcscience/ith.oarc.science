# The Delight Makers

## by Adolf F. Bandelier

#### \[1890\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adolf Bandelier was a pioneering Southwestern explorer and
anthropologist. This is a novel based on his experiences with the Pueblo
Native Americans of New Mexico. The ethnographic novel very rarely works
as either ethnography or novel. In this case, it works as both. Not only
does *The Delight Makers* open a door into the world of the
pre-Columbian Pueblo Indians, it is also a great contribution to the
literature of the Southwest.

*The Delight Makers* is a Greek tragedy of a story, in which the
treachery of a woman causes a community to fall apart. As the story
progresses, we become immersed in Pueblo culture, to the point where we
don't even notice when Bandelier stops explaining the untranslated terms
and unfamiliar customs.
