# IN MEMORY

ONE day of August, 1888, in the teeth of a particular New Mexico
sand-storm that whipped pebbles the size of a bean straight to your
face, a ruddy, bronzed, middle-aged man, dusty but unweary with his
sixty-mile tramp from Zuñi, walked into my solitary camp at Los
Alamitos. Within the afternoon I knew that here was the most
[extraordinary](errata.htm#0.md) mind I had met. There and then began the
uncommon friendship which lasted till his death, a quarter of a century
later; and a love and admiration which will be of my dearest memories so
long as I shall live. I was at first suspicious of the "pigeon-hole
memory" which could not only tell me some Queres word I was searching
for, but add: "Policárpio explained that to me in Cochiti, November 23,
1881." But I discovered that this classified memory was an integral part
of this extraordinary genius. The acid tests of life-long collaboration
proved not only this but the judicial poise, the marvelous insight and
the intellectual chastity of Bandelier's mind. I cannot conceive of
anything in the world which would have made him trim his sails as a
historian or a student for any advantage here or hereafter.

Aside from keen mutual interests of documentary and ethnologic study, we
came to know one another humanly by the hard proof of the Frontier.
Thousands

<span id="page_xxvi">p. xxvi</span>

of miles of wilderness and desert we trudged side by side--camped,
starved, shivered, learned and were Glad together. Our joint pursuits in
comfort at our homes (in Santa Fé and Isleta, respectively) will always
be memorable to me; but never so wonderful as that companioning in the
hardships of what was, in our day, the really difficult fringe of the
Southwest. There was not a decent road. We had no endowment, no
vehicles. Bandelier was once loaned a horse; and after riding two miles,
led it the rest of the thirty. So we went always by foot; my big camera
and glass plates in the knapsack on my back, the heavy tripod under my
arm; his aneroid, surveying instruments, and satchel of the almost
microscopic notes which he kept fully and precisely every night by the
camp-fire (even when I had to crouch over him and the precious paper
with my water-proof focusing cloth) somehow bestowed about him. Up and
down pathless cliffs, through tangled cañons, fording icy streams and
ankle-deep sands, we travailed; no blankets, overcoats, or other
shelter; and the only commissary a few cakes of sweet chocolate, and a
small sack of parched popcorn meal. Our "lodging was the cold ground."
When we could find a cave, a tree, or anything to temper the wind or
keep off part of the rain, all right. If not, the Open. So I came to
love him as well as revere. I had known many "scientists" and what
happened when they really got Outdoors. He was in no way an athlete--nor
even muscular. I was both--and not very long before had completed my
thirty-five-hundred-mile "Tramp Across the Continent."\[paragraph

But I never had to "slow down" for him. Sometimes it was necessary to
use laughing force to detain him at dark where we had water and a
leaning cliff, instead of stumbling on through the trackless night to an
unknown "Somewheres." He has always reminded me of John Muir, the only
other man I have known intimately who was as insatiate a climber and
inspiring a talker. But Bandelier had one advantage. He could find
common ground with *anyone*. I have seen him with Presidents, diplomats,
Irish section-hands, Mexican peons, Indians, authors, scientists and
"society." Within an hour or so he was easily the Center. Not
unconscious of his power, he had an extraordinary and sensitive modesty,
which handicapped him through life among those who had the "gift of
push." He never put himself forward either in person or in his writing.
But something about him fascinated all these far-apart classes of
people, when he spoke. His command of English, French, Spanish, and
German might have been expected; but his facility in acquiring the
"dialects" of railroad men and cowboys, or the language of an Indian
tribe, was almost uncanny. When he first visited me, in Isleta, he knew
just three words of Tigua. In ten days he could make himself understood
by the hour with the Principales in their own unwritten tongue. Of
course, this was one secret of his extraordinary success in learning the
inner heart of the Indians.

I saw it proved again in our contact with the Quíchua and Aymará and
other tribes of Peru and Bolivia.

I have known many scholars and some heroes-but they seldom come in the
same original package. As I remember Bandelier with smallpox alone in
the two-foot snows of the Manzanos; his tens of thousands of miles of
tramping, exploring, measuring, describing, in the Southwest; his year
afoot and alone in Northern Mexico, with no more weapon than a
pen-knife, on the trails of raiding Apaches (where "scientific
expeditions" ten years later, when the Apache was eliminated, needed
armed convoys and pack-trains enough for a punitive expedition, and
wrote pretentious books about what every scholar has known for three
hundred years) I deeply wonder at the dual quality of his intellect.
Among them all, I have never known such student and such explorer lodged
in one tenement.

We were knit not only thus but in the very intimacies of life-sharing
hopes and bereavements. My first son, named for him, should now be
twenty-two. The old home in Santa Fé was as my own. The truly wonderful
little woman he found in Peru for mate--who shared his hardships among
the cannibals of the Amazonas and elsewhere, and so aided and still
carries on his work--I met in her maiden home, and am glad I may still
call her friend.

Naturally, among my dearest memories of our trampings together is that
of the Rito, the Tyuonyi. It had never in any way been pictured before.
We were the first students that ever explored it. He had discovered it,
and was writing "The Delight Makers." What days those were! The weather
was no friend

<span id="page_xxix">p. xxix</span>

of ours, nor of the camera's. We were wet and half-fed, and cold by
night, even in the ancient tiny caves. But the unforgettable glory of it
all!

To-day thousands of people annually visit the Tyuonyi at ease, and camp
for weeks in comfort. The School of American Archaeology has a summer
session there; and its excavations verify Bandelier's surmises. Normal
students and budding archaeologists sleep in the very caves (identified)
of the Eagle People, the Turquoise, Snake and other clans. And in that
enchanted valley we remember not only the Ancients, but the man who gave
all this to the world.

During the six years I was Librarian of the Los Angeles Public Library,
far later, no other out-of-print book on the Southwest was so eagerly
sought as "The Delight Makers." We had great trouble in getting our own
copy, which slept in the safe. The many students who wished copies of
their very own were referred to dealers in Americana, who searched for
this already rare volume; and many were proud to get it, at last, at
ten, fifteen and even twenty times its original price. It will always be
a standard--the most photographic story yet printed of the life of the
prehistoric Americans.
