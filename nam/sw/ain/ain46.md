### A SONG OF TCHEUNASSAT SEEVEN

There stands a dead vahahkkee  
On top of it there runs back and forth the Seeven  
And he has a robe with yellow hand prints on it.

### THE LARK'S SONG ABOUT HIS LOST WIFE <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md)

My poor wife!  
In the West she seems to be bound by the song of the Bamboo.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_8"></span>[240:1](ain46.htm#fr_8.md) This is a Pima
flute-song, a record of which I obtained for my phonograph while in
Arizona. It has no direct connection with the legends; but illustrates
the Story of Tcheunassat Seeven a little, as it is about a woman, the
wife of an Indian named the Lark, who is led away by the seductive
singing of another Indian named the Bamboo; the Indians having an idea
that women were most easily seduced by music. The Pimas, when they speak
English, calling the wild cane bamboo.
