### JUHWERTA MAHKAI'S SONG BEFORE THE FLOOD

       My poor people,  
       Who will see,  
       Who will see  
This water which will moisten the earth!

### THE SONG OF SUPERSTITION MOUNTAINS

We are destroyed!  
By my stone we are destroyed!  
We are rightly turned into stone.

### EE-EE-TOY'S SONG WHEN HE MADE THE WORLD SERPENTS

I know what to do;  
I am going to move the water both ways.
