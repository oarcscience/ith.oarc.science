This is a rare book of Pima folklore, transcribed by a sympathetic
amateur ethnographer at the beginning of the twentieth century. The Pima
live in the arid deserts of southern Arizona, and originally survived by
horticulture and hunting/gathering. Lloyd was not a linguist, and
collected the stories through an interpreter. All of the Pima words and
phrases are written using a crude 'phonetic' system, which no doubt is
fairly inaccurate. However, this does not invalidate the folklore, which
is well-told and consistent with other southwestern Native American
mythology, particularly in its repetition of the number four.
