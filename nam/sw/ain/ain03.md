### THE TRADITIONS OF THE PIMAS

THE old man, Comalk Hawk-Kih, (Thin Buckskin) began by saying that these
were stories which he used to hear his father tell, they being handed
down from father to son, and that when he was little he did not pay much
attention, but when he grew older he determined to learn them, and asked
his father to teach him, which his father did, and now he knew them all.
