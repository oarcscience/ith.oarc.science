### NOTES ON THE STORY OF AH-AHN-HE-EAT-TOE-PAHK MAHKAI

In the story of Ah-ahn-he-eat-toe-pahk Mahkai we are introduced to the
Indian faith in dreams and to more witchcraft. We come, too, to the
national sport of rabbit-hunting, with its picturesqueness and
excitement.

In the transaction between Seevalick and the boy we have a reappearance
of the world-wide belief that there is a connection between the wind and
the human soul.

The strange quality of savage humor, labored, sometimes gruesome, and
often tragic, appears in the latter part of the tale.

It is noticeable that they buried the old man, but no mention is made of
burying the woman who was shot. The Pimas of old time buried their dead
in a sitting posture, neck and knees tied together with ropes, four to
six feet under ground, and covered the grave with logs and thorn-brush
to keep away wolves. The interment was usually at night, with chants,
but without other ceremony. Then, immediately after, the house of the
deceased was burned, and all personal effects destroyed, even food; the
horses and cattle being killed and eaten by the mourners, excepting such
as the deceased might have given to his heirs. After the prescribed time
of mourning (one month for a child or distant relative, six months or a
year for husband or wife) the name of the dead was never more mentioned
and everything about him treated as forgotten.

The Maricopas burn their dead.

It is noticeable, too, that no one appears to have punished the slayer
for his murderous practical jokes. Indeed, while the Awawtam appear to
have been people of exceptionally good character, it also appears that
they seldom punished any crimes except by a sort of boycott or pressure
of public disapproval.
