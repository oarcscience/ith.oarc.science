### THE DESTRUCTION OF THE VAHAHKKEES

(The Pima plural of *vah-ahk-kee* is *vahp-ahk-kee*, but I have made all
plurals English, as more understandable.)

AND after this they were not sick any more, and they came to the Gila
Country, to Ee-ee-toy's land, the Land of the Vahahkkees, and here they
divided themselves into four parties, of which one went south; but the
doctors united them all by "The Light," so that they would know about
each other in case there was a battle in which any needed assistance.

And as they came into this country the people there were stirred up with
alarm, and the great doctor who lived at Casa Blanca, whose name was
*Tcheu-tchick-a-dah-tai Seeven*, sent his son to Stcheuadack Seeven, at
Casa Grande, to enquire if there were any prophecies that he knew of
about the coming of this great invading army.

So the boy went, but just before he got there he heard a frog, a big
one, which Stcheuadack Seeven kept for a pet and to assist him in his
work as a doctor, and when the boy heard the frog he was frightened, and
ran back, and when his father asked what he had learned, he said:
"Nothing, I heard a noise there that frightened me, so I ran home
again."

And his father said: "That is nothing to be

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

afraid of, that is only the voice of his pet, his frog," and he sent the
boy once more.

So the boy went again, and came to Stcheuadack Seeven who asked him what
his father had sent him for, and the boy replied that his father wanted
to know if there were any prophecies about the coming of this enemy, and
how he felt about it every evening.

When the boy returned his father asked him what Stcheuadack Seeven knew,
and how he felt, and the boy said: "He does not know anything. He says
he sits out every night, and hears the different animals, and enjoys
their pleasant voices, and in the morning he enjoys hearing the sweet
songs of the birds, and he always feels good, and does not fear
anything."

So his father said: "I am well satisfied that I will not be the first to
see this thing happen. It will be Stcheuadack Seeven who will first see
it, and it will not be ten days before it will occur."

And in a few days Ee-ee-toy's army came to the village of Stcheuadack
Seeven and killed all the people there.

And Geeaduck Seeven, who lived at Awawtkum Vahahkkee, told his people to
flee: and many did so and ran to the mountains and other places, but the
others who did not run away came to Geeaduck Seeven's house, and he told
them to come in there.

And the enemy came, and they fought, but it was not easy for Ee-ee-toy's
warriors to fight=-the

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

men of Geeaduck Seeven, because they were nearly all inside, but his men
managed to set fire to the house, and so destroyed it, and killed all
who were therein.

Then Ee-ee-toy's men marched on, north, to where *Cheof-hahvo Seeven*,
or Long Dipper Chief, lived, and as they marched along they sang about
the places they were conquering, and they sang of the beads that they
expected to get at this village, the beads called *sah-vaht-kih*, and
there was an old woman among them who said: "When you get those beads, I
want them." And so when they had conquered that vahahkkee they gave the
beads to her.

And they went from there to the home of Dthas Seeven, who had a
cane-cactus fence about his place, and Ee-ee-toy's men heard of this,
and sang about it as they went along. And they took this place and
killed Dthas Seeven.

And then they went on to where the Casa Blanca vahahkkees now are in
ruins; and the great doctor who lived there, the same who had sent his
boy to inquire of the prophecies, drew a magic line before his place, so
that the enemy could not cross. And when Ee-ee-toy's men came to the
line the earth opened, and they could not go further till one of their
great doctors, by his power, had closed it, and then they could pass it.

And they had a great battle there, for the place was very strong, and
hard to get into. And there was a doctor among them called *Nee-hum
Mah-kai*,

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

or Thunder Doctor, and they asked him to use his magic power to tear the
place down, and he tried, but could not succeed. And they asked another,
called *Tchu-dun Mahkai*, or Earthquake Doctor, and he tried and failed
also. And then they asked another, a little man, not supposed to have
much power, and he took a hair from his head, and held it up by the two
ends, and sang a song, and turned it into a snake. And he sent the
snake, and it struck the house, and shook it so that it broke and fell
down from above. And then Ee-ee-toy's men took the place, and killed
everybody there except Tcheutchickadahtai Seeven, who escaped and ran
on.

And one of Ee-ee-toy's warriors pursued him, and was going to strike him
with a club when he sank down, and the place where he sank was filled
with a fog, so that they could not see him, and he got out on the other
side and ran on. But they had a doctor called *Ku-mi-wahk Mahkai*, or
Fog Doctor, and they had him clear away the fog and then they could see
him and chased him again.

And again, when about to be struck, he sank down, and a mirage filled
the place so that they could not see him, for things did not look the
same. And he got out beyond, and ran on. And they had a *Sas-katch
Mahkai*, or Mirage Doctor, who cleared away the false appearance, and
again they chased him, and were about to kill him, when again he sank.

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

And this time a rainbow filled the place and made him invisible, and
again he ran on till their *Kee-hawt Mahkai*, or Rainbow Doctor, removed
the rainbow.

And once more they were about to strike him when he sank, and the
quivers which heat makes, called *coad-jook*, filled the hole, and again
he got away. But they had a Coadjook Doctor, and he removed it, and then
they chased him and killed him.

And they went northward again from there.

And there was a rattlesnake who had never killed an enemy, and he asked
a doctor to help him do this, and the doctor told him he would. And the
doctor told his pet gopher to dig a hole to the village of the doctor
who lived beyond *Od-chee*, where is the place called *Scaw-coy-enk*, or
Rattlesnake Village. And this doctor was the speaker of his village, and
every morning stood on a big stone and in a loud voice told the people
what they were to do. And the gopher dug a hole to this stone, through
which the rattlesnake crawled and lay in wait under the stone. And when
the doctor came out to speak to his people in the morning, the
rattlesnake bit him and then slid back into his hole again. And the
doctor came down from the stone, and went into his kee, and fell down
there and died.

And after taking this place they marched to the place called *Ko-awt-kee
Oy-yee-duck*, or Shell Field, where a doctor-chief lived, named
Tcheunasset

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

Seeven, and this place they took, and Ee-ee-toy himself killed this
doctor, this being the first foe he had killed.

And they went on again to the place where Nooee lived, called
*Wuh-a-kutch*. And Ee-ee-toy said: "When you come there you will know
the man who killed me by his white leggings, and when you find him, do
not kill him, but capture him, and bring him to me, and I will do what I
please with him."

And Ee-ee-toy had the Eagle and the Chicken-Hawk go up in the sky to
look for Noo-ee, for he said he might go up there. And the Eagle and the
Chicken-Hawk found Nooee there, and caught him, and brought him to
Ee-ee-toy, who took him and scalped him alive. And Nooee, after he was
scalped, fell down and died, and the women came around him, rejoicing
and dancing, and singing; "O why is Seeven dead!" And after awhile be
began to come to life again, and lay there rolling and moaning.

And Ee-ee-toy's men went on again to a village beyond Salt River, where
lived a chief who had a brother, and they were both left-handed, but
famous shots with the bow. And these brothers put up the hardest fight
yet encountered. But when the brothers were too hard pressed they fled
to *Cheof See-vick*, or Tall Red Mountain, and there they kept shooting
and killed a great many of Ee-ee-toy's men, who were short of arrows,
after so long fighting and many of their bows broken.

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

Because of this, Ee-ee-toy's men had to fall back and surround the
place.

And when this happened the band that had gone to the south knew by the
"Light" that it was so, and came to help them. And these had many bows
and arrows, and beside brought wood to mend the broken bows, and wood to
make new arrows; and when they came into the place they gave their bows
and arrows to Ee-ee-toy's men and made themselves new bows from the wood
they had brought. And these men were the ancestors of the *Toe-hawn-awh
Aw-aw-tam*, the present Papagoes, and that is why to this day the
Papagoes are most expert in making bows and arrows. And then the fight
began again and the two brave brothers were killed.

And from there they went on to another awawtkumvahahkkee, where is now
Fort McDowell, where lived another seeven whom they fought and
conquered.

And from there they went on westward thru the mountains. But when they
came to *Kah-woet-kee*, near where is now Phoenix, one of the chiefs in
Ee-ee-toy's army said: "I have seen enuf of this country, and I will
take this for my part and remain here." And he did so.

And the bands went on and came to the Colorado River, and there one of
the great doctors, called *Gaht Mahkai*, or Bow Doctor, struck the river
with his bow and laid it down in the water. And the water separated then
so that the people

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

were able to go over to the other side. And beyond the Colorado they
Came to a people who lived in holes in the ground, whom they found it
hard to fight, and they asked help of their Thunder Doctor, and when the
people came out of their holes to fight he struck right in the midst of
them, but killed only one. Then they asked help of the Earthquake
Doctor, and he was able to kill only one, And these two were all they
killed. And these people were called *Choo-chawf Aw-aw-tam*, or the
Foxes, because they lived in holes.

And after the army failed to conquer the Foxes they returned across the
Colorado River, near where is now Yuma. And here again the Bow Doctor
divided the water for them. But before all the bands were across the
waters closed, and some were left behind. And these called to those who
were across to have the Bow Doctor hit the waters again, that they also
might get there. But those who were across would not do this, but told
them that there was plenty of land where they were that would make them
a comfortable home. And those left there were the ancestors of the
present Yumas and Maricopas.
