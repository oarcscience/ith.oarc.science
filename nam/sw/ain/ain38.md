### NOTES ON THE STORY OF THE GAMBLER'S WAR

In this we are given wonderful glimpses into the strange, fierce, sad,
extravagant poetry of the Indian speeches, which seem oftenest inspired
by the passion of revenge. Notice that in these stories, if several
speeches are given in any one story, they generally have a quite similar
ending, a sort of refrain: "So, my relatives," etc.

This story ends abruptly, and is, I think, manifestly only a fragment.
Following the speeches, which were mere boastful prophecies, should have
been an account in detail of the actual campaign, as in the story of
Pahtahnkum's war.
