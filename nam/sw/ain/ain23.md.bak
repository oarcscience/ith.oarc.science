### THE SONG OF NOOEE WHEN HE WENT TO THE SUN

The Rising (Sun) I am going to meet.

(Repeated many times)

### WHEN NOOEE [KILLED](errata.htm#18) EE-EE-TOY <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md)

(A Song)

The gun, he gave it to me as a cane;  
With it I killed the Brother's heart.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_3"></span>[131:1](ain23.htm#fr_3.md) The reference to the
"gun" shows clearly that this song was made after the advent of the
white man.
