### NOTES ON THE STORY OF NAHVAHCHOO

The story of Nahvahchoo was celebrated till lately among the Pimas by
dancing games, resembling those described in this story, the players
wearing masks and gourds, and rattling notched sticks, one of them
impersonating Nahvahchoo himself.

In the reference to the earth's moving, in one of the speeches, one
might suspect a glimpse of true astronomical knowledge, but this is
likely only a poetic figure.

The "everlasting corn will" reminds a little of the old folk-lore tale
of the everlasting salt mill whose continuous grinding makes the ocean
salt.
