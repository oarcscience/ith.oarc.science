### NOTES ON THE STORY OF THE TURQUOISES

Turquoises seem to have been regarded by all Arizona Indians as magical
and lucky stones, and the Story of the Turquoises professes to give
their origin.

Of the game, toe-coll, here spoken of, Whittemore gives this account in
Cook's "Among the Pimas:" "One of the amusements of the women was that
of tossing balls. They had two small ones, covered with buckskin, and
tied about six inches apart. Young women and married, from thirty to
seventy-five in a group, assembled as dressed for a ball, their hair
carefully manipulated so as to be black and glossy. Each had a stick of
willow six feet long. With these they dextrously tossed the balls high
in the air, running after them until one party was so weary that they
gave up the game from mere exhaustion.

In order to make the excitement a success they had certain active women,
keen of wit and quick of action, practice weeks in advance."

Sometimes the balls were formed by two large knots in a short piece of
rope.
