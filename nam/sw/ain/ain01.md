# ERRATA

In this book of Pima legends, various errors with regard to Indian words
have occurred which will be corrected in a second edition. These are
principally as follows:

The rule was made that all Indian words should be printed the first time
in italics, with hyphens to facilitate pronunciation; afterwards in
roman type, without hyphens. This rule has many times been violated.

There is a lack of uniformity in the spelling, etc., of many of the
Indian terms. Thus the name of the old seeneeyawkum has been spelled in
different ways, but should always be Comalk Hawkkih. The name of the
Creator should always be Juwerta Mahkai. The name of his subordinate
should be Eeheetoy. Gee-ee-sop should be Geeheesop. Cheof should be
Cheoff. Vah-kee-woldt-kee, as on Page 8, should be Vahf-kee-woldt-kih as
on page [112](ain18.htm#page_112). Sah-kote-kee, on page
[183](ain34.htm#page_183), should be Sah-kot-kih, and Chirt-kee should
be Chirt-kih. On page [224](ain41.htm#page_224), vahs-shroms should be
vahs-hroms. Tcheuassat Seeven (page [237](ain45.htm#page_237)) should be
Tcheunassat Seeven. Stchenadack Seeven (page [238](ain45.htm#page_238))
should be Stcheuadack Seeven. Scheunassat Seeven, on page
[239](ain45.htm#page_239), should be Tcheunassat Seeven. In the story of
the Turquoises and the Red bird (page [99](ain14.htm#page_99)) the name
of the chief who lived in the Casa Grande ruins should have been spelled
with a u, instead of a w, to secure uniformity; also the Indian name of
the turquoises. The name of the Salt River Mountain, wherever it occurs,
should always be Moehahdheck.
