### NOTES ON HOW NOOEE KILLED EE-EE-TOY

The hot arrows of Ee-ee-toy, that withered the crops, remind us of
Apollo.

The idea often comes up in these stories that a person possessing the
powers of a mahkai was hard to kill, having as many lives as a cat. It
would also appear that there was a confusion as to what constituted
killing, anyway, They perhaps regarded mere unconsciousness as death.
Both Ee-ee-toy and Nooee are "killed," but after an interval are alive
again. And Whittemore relates: "An Apache, seeing Louis, the Pima
interpreter, came to him in high glee. Taking his hand, he said: 'You
are the Pima who killed me years ago.' Louis then recognized him as the
man to whom he had dealt a heavy blow with a warclub, and then left him
for dead on the battle-field."

Is there any connection between [the](errata.htm#19.md) fact that when
Nooee wore a nose-ring of turquoise the earth looked green, and that
when he wore a nose-ring of glittering she'll the earth looked dry to
him?

Could this whole story have been a myth of some great drouth?
