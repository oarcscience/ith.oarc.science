# NOTES ON STORY OF CREATION

The idea of creating the earth from the perspiration and waste cuticle
of the Creator is, I believe, original.

The local touch in making the greasewood bush the first vegetation is
very strong.

In the tipping over of the earth three times, and its standing right the
fourth time, we are introduced to the first of the mystic fours in which
the whole scheme of the stories is cast. Almost everything is done four
times before finished.

The peculiar Indian idea of type-animals, the immortal and supernatural
representatives of their respective animal tribes, appears in Nooee and
Toehahvs, and here again the local color is rich and strong in making
the buzzard and the coyote, the most common and striking animals of the
desert, the particular aides on the staff of the Creator.

Might not the creation of Nooee out of the shadow of the eyes of the
Doctor of the Earth be a poetical allusion to the flying shadow of the
buzzard on the sun-bright desert?

In the creation of sun and moon we find the mystic four referred to the
four corners of the universe, North, South, East and West, and this, I
am persuaded, is really the origin of its sacred significance, for most
religions find root and source in astronomy.

In the dropping of the sky appears the old idea of its solid character.

In the "slope of the world to the Westward" there is something curiously
significant when we remember that both the Gila and Salt Rivers flow
generally westward.

Nooee cuts the valleys with his wings. It would almost appear that Nooee
was Juhwertamahkai's agent in the air and sky, Toehahvs on earth.

The night-prowling coyote is appropriately and poetically mothered by
the moon.

And here appears Eeeetoy, the most active and mysterious personality in
Piman mythology. Out of the North, apparently
[self-existent](errata.htm#4.md), but little inferior in power to
Juhwertamahkai, and claiming greater age, he appears, by pure "bluff"
and persistent push and wheedling, to have induced the really more
powerful, but good-natured and rather lazy Juhwertamahkai to give over
most of the real work and government of the world to him. In conversing
with Harry Azul, the head chief's son, at Sacaton, I found he regarded
Eeeetoy and Juhwertamahki as but two names for the same. And indeed it
is hard to fix Eeeetoy's place or power.
