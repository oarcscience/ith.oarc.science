# II: Dances of the Rio Grande Pueblos

The Rio Grande pueblos are the Indian villages of New Mexico from Acoma
eastward to the Rio Grande and north to Taos. Zuñi and the Hopi villages
are of the same type, but they are so different and so distinctive in
their ceremonial life that they can best be handled separately.

The Rio Grande Pueblos are divided, linguistically, into four groups.
The Keres include the people of Acoma and Laguna, in western New Mexico,
and those of the Rio Grande valley: San Felipe, Santo Domingo, Santa
Ana, Zia, and Cochiti. The Tewa language is spoken in the villages north
of Santa Fe: Tesuque, Santa Clara, San Ildefonso, San Juan, and the
dying Nambe. Isleta and Taos, set so far apart, and Picuris belong to
the Tanos group and speak the Tiwa tongue. Jemez speaks its own
language, its only related pueblo, Pecos, having been abandoned in 1838
when the survivors moved to Jemez. Their descendants still maintain some
autonomy, and certain old Pecos ceremonies are celebrated at Jemez in
their honor.

In spite of differences of language, these people all show a close
similarity of ceremonial form and organization,

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

and their dances may be considered as a group. All these pueblos are
divided into clans, groups related through the mother, and intermarriage
within the clan is still prohibited. When the extinction of a clan is
threatened, as recently happened at Tesuque, a woman of the failing clan
may be introduced from another village, so close is the association.
Besides the clans there are esoteric societies, into which one is
initiated and not born. These are very secret, and most Indians, in
casual conversation, will deny knowledge of them. Women belong to
certain of the men's societies, and there are societies exclusively for
women. Such societies have their leaders, called fathers or chiefs, and
they are responsible for certain ceremonies. They vary somewhat in the
different pueblos, but every village seems to have its societies in
charge of war, of the hunt, of curing, and of the weather. All pueblos
also are divided into the Winter and the Summer People, sometimes called
the Turquoise and the Squash People. These groups have general
supervision of the ceremonies of their respective seasons and often each
of them has a cacique.

The dance is only a part of a long ceremony, which may include visits to
secret shrines in the mountains, days of secret ritual in the kivas or
in the society rooms, and the public finale in the dance. Even the dance
may be secret; probably the most important dances always are. In that
case they are performed in bidden places or in the plaza, which is then
protected from intruders by guards posted along all roads. In a few
places, as at Cochiti and at Jemez, white people are permitted to
witness certain dances in the kivas. Dancers usually fast for four days
before the dance,

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

which means that they omit certain foods, such as salt or meat. During
that time they remain continent and purge themselves daily; sometimes a
daily emetic is used. During this time the society altar is built,
costumes for the dance are made or refreshed, prayers are chanted, and
prayer-plumes are made ceremonially. Prayer-plumes are small sticks,
painted and decorated with feathers, often laid on with a skill which a
milliner might envy.

Each pueblo has a society of fun-makers: Koshare or Kurena among the
Keres, Kossa among the Tewa, Chiffonete at Taos. The Chiffonete probably
come closest to being a purely fun-making group. Among the other peoples
the clown societies are able to cure certain diseases; and their
membership is increased by those whom they have cured, or by the
initiation of anyone they catch crossing a mystic line of corn-meal
drawn about their house on certain occasions. They can control waters by
making floods recede or rain fall. Also they can increase fertility in
man or beast or plant; and therein lies their license to joke as
obscenely as they wish. Whenever they appear in a dance, these
fun-makers are privileged to do or say anything, and nobody may resent
it; the dancers do not even appear to see them. It is said that the
jokes usually are censorious; the Koshare use their privilege to correct
the foibles of their people by salutary laughter. They often do this in
pantomime, bits of drama which might well be the beginnings of an
indigenous theater. These formless scraps are in fact so like the
earliest Greek drama as to be startling. No development along this line
can be hoped for, however. The government grudgingly permits these
ceremonies to continue as

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

they are, but Indian school training has so successfully throttled the
Indian's native fertility of imagination that he will go no further. But
if the heavy hand could be lifted, imagine what a gorgeous contribution
he might make to drama--this Indian with his gift for the grotesque, his
sly sardonic humor, and his perception of human frailty which is witty
without being bitter!

The usual explanation of the Koshare is that they represent the spirit
of the dead or of "the ancients"; hence their invisibility and their
supernatural powers. Ordinarily their costumes consist only of a
gee-string and a coat of whitewash with which faces, bodies, and hair
are smeared, an effect weird and dirty in the extreme. Black-ringed eyes
add to the ghostly effect, and sprays of dry corn-husks tied to the
hair, and strings of rabbit-skins, typify death to the Indian. Bunches
of pine on the arms mean life everlasting. The serious powers and
purpose of this society never appear during a dance. Then they are
fun-makers purely. Often they alter their costume to suit the pantomime
or dialogue of the occasion, especially when they make fun of white
people, when their costumes are a sad travesty of the American dress.

Whenever these clowns take part in a dance, it is safe to say that the
ceremony is a Katchina dance, which means that the spirit they invoke is
actually present. Originally, no doubt, all Katchina dances were masked,
as they still are at Zuñi and in the Hopi villages, but wherever the
Catholic Church has attained any power, they are performed secretly, or
without masks. Even in the Rio Grande villages a quiet investigator may
sometimes find the little

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Katchina images,
dolls made in the likeness of the masked figures. They are carved of
cottonwood, painted, dressed, and feathered just as the dancers are.
Often Katchinas are playthings for children, but they have a sacred
significance and they are usually hidden from white people. This use of
images probably facilitated the introduction of Catholic saints. In
fact, one Indian was heard to refer to a certain Catholic image as "the
Jesus Katchina."

Many new-comers and many insensitive people state that all Indian dances
are alike; "when you have seen one, you have seen them all." This is a
great protection to those who like the dances, for the mob stampedes to
certain well-advertised *fiestas* and leaves the others to the few who
appreciate the distinctions. As a matter of fact, the similarity ends
with certain points of costume and of form. The usual costume consists
of Hopi garments for the men: a white hand-woven kirtle embroidered in
red, green, and black, a sash of the same material, either embroidered
or finished with a heavy knotted fringe. A fox-skin dangles from the
waist-line at the back, its full tail almost sweeping the ground. A
turtle-shell rattle is tied under the left knee, a string of shells
hangs over one shoulder, the moccasins are edged with skunk fur to keep
away witches. If the man's hair is long, it hangs loose, having been
freshly washed in amole suds and brushed in the sunshine until it
shines. He wears all the family wealth of silver, turquoise, wampum, and
coral around his neck. In different dances variety is introduced in
head-dresses, feathers, shields, and the paint on his upper body.

The typical woman's dance costume is the squaw dress,

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

a black one-piece garment of hand-woven wool. It covers the right
shoulder, leaves the left one bare, hangs straight to the knees, and is
tied at the waist by a red squaw belt. Usually women dance barefooted in
order that they may receive from the earth the spirit of fertility.
Their hair, too, hangs loose and they wear jewelry. Variety comes in the
use of over-garments, head-pieces, feathers.

Why certain people dance on certain occasions does not appear; the
Indians simply will not tell. It seems, however, that every Indian, man
or woman, owes obligation to take part in certain ceremonies each year.
This is powerful enough to bring back to the pueblos many Indians who
actually live away from them. The dance groups are probably based on the
clan and society affiliations, and apparently a man and his wife do not
dance at the same time.

The music for the dance is usually a chant, sung by the dancers or by a
chorus, sometimes unaccompanied, but usually assisted by the beat of a
drum or by the rubbing of notched sticks across a hollow gourd. The
chant is presumably the prayer, though often those who sing it do not
understand it all. Apparently the words used are archaic; sometimes the
Indians say they are not words at all, merely sounds. The effect is
vigorous, almost angular, unmelodious, unharmonized, but marvelously
rhythmic and varied in its rhythm.

The dances described here are not all, by any means. These have been
selected as most interesting or most characteristic of the people who
give them. Whenever an explanation can be found, it has been given. So
far, even the most painstaking and the most scientific investigators
have

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

failed to get the hidden significance of most of the movements of a
dance. In looking at any Indian dance, therefore, it is well to imitate
the Indian: sit back quietly against an adobe wall, soak into your body
and into your soul the stimulating warmth of the sunshine, smoke or
chat, watch the *viga* shadows move along the walls as the hours pass,
let the beat of the *tombe* and the dancing feet get into your
blood--and feel what it is all about. This method has the enormous
advantage of permitting no contradiction; every man's guess is then as
good as any other man's.

### WINTER DANCES

January in New Mexico is usually brilliant and cold. Purple mountains
stand etched in silver snow against the sky; streams are icy, but
running between banks massed with red willow and white cottonwoods,
which will rattle their copper leaves until spring growth pushes them
off. Blue smoke rises from painted chimney-pots in the pueblos, and
gaunt horses poke about hopelessly, looking for food. On all the roads,
Indians wrapped in vari-colored blankets ride from pueblo to pueblo on
horses, in wagons, and nowadays in cars. Farmers have no winter work,
the ceremonial season is on, and they love to see each other's dances.
Almost any night, chanting may be heard in the kivas, and on many days
dancing may be seen in the plazas.

There are many kinds of dances, almost an endless variety, for summer
dances are often given during these months for practice; but usually
winter dances are for the hunt: prayers for abundant game and for
successful

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

hunters, and apologies to the guardian spirits of the game for the
necessary sacrifice.

Probably the ancient ceremonial year of the Pueblos began at the spring
solstice, which they could determine in primitive ways. Nowadays the
Indians recognize the white man's calendar by electing their governor
just before the new year and by inaugurating him on Twelfth-night. So we
begin there.

*The Deer-dance at Taos*

Before sun-up on January sixth I sat in Taos Pueblo, watching the
village come awake. A few thin blue lines of smoke rose from the
chimney-pots, but there was no other sign of life. The mountain flanks
were black with pines, cottonwood and aspens along the streams were
white, and Pueblo Creek was coated thinly with ice. All around Taos are
cultivated fields, and the two villages, facing each other across the
creek, rise in tiers to a height of four or five stories--the tallest of
the famous terraced pueblos.

A few dogs appeared scratching, and then men whom I took to be the
Chiffonete. In blankets and moccasins they climbed down ladders from the
houses, sometimes stopping at the stream to wash, sometimes going
directly to the kivas with mysterious bundles of ceremonial things under
their blankets. In Taos the kiva entrances are flush with the ground,
boldly announced by the tall ladder-poles. Usually one man sat near the
ladder, possibly a door-keeper. A little later women began to emerge
from the houses, heavy-legged in buckskin boots, with long, full skirts
and shawls of soft colors or black. They carried jars, or lard-pails, to

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

the stream for water, they swept with bundles of grass, they carried
from house to house the stiff carcasses of sheep, which would later feed
the dancers.

Finally the newly elected governor stepped out on his house-top and
called, urging all the dancers to go to church. Three gubernatorial
calls, muezzen-like in the clear air, three peals of the mission bell,
and the people began to drift toward the church. Moving softly, they
made a brilliant pageant against the adobe church, with its whitewashed
wall. All were wrapped in blankets, plain or striped, and falling in
soft loops on the men and stiff cones on the women from their heads to
their moccasined feet. The Catholic priest was not present, but his
pagan congregation knelt reverently on the adobe floor and murmured
responsive prayers to the Christian God before beginning their appeal to
the gods of the hunt.

Chiffonete always appear for this dance, bare bodies painted in stripes,
and their faces decorated evidently with much individual license in
spirals, whorls, and concentric circles, also in black and white. On
their heads they wear corn-husks, which make fine golden sprays above
the chignon. They whoop and yell, always with the restrained musical
call of the Indian; they rush up and down ladders and in and out of
houses, bringing laughter wherever they go. In every house they are
given presents, usually food. All day the Chiffonete run round, making
"wise-cracks," shivering in the cold, and often yielding to the
seductions of a shawl around the middle.

Soon after noon the dancers appear. First comes a group of men and women
who perform the Corn-dance, which is

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

a summer dance, but always suitable, since it is a prayer for growth.
They dance in two facing rows, their feet shifting lightly, their hands
moving up and down, all in perfect time to the chanting of a group of
blanketed men who stamp solemnly ahead of them as they move across the
plaza. The women carry bunches of feathers in one hand, evergreens in
the other; the men have gourd rattles with which they emphasize the
steady beat of the song. The costumes are brilliant, and Indian in
feeling, though they are composed mostly of the silks and silkalines,
ribbons and calicoes which can be bought in the stores. They dance
several times, finally finishing in front of the church.

Suddenly queer distant calls are heard, and beyond a broken adobe wall
appears a long moving line of deer-antlers. At once the corn-dancers
leave and the deer enter, fifty or sixty men and boys wrapped
full-length in deer-hides. The heads are well preserved and the faces of
the men are hardly noticeable as they move bent over sticks in their
bands which make the animal's front legs. There is no color; with
dun-colored bodies, horned heads, and weird cries they move like bemused
creatures, coming among human beings and knowing themselves for the
appointed sacrifice. Among the deer may be a few other animals; men
stripped and painted black and wearing heavy buffalo heads; small boys
wrapped in the skins of bobcats or coyotes; even tiny tots smothered
under the feathers of a turkey. Very small boys walk hidden under the
bent bodies of the men.

These costumes are probably an example of the most primitive type of
mask: the use of the entire skin to transform

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

the man into the animal and so, somehow, to trick the game into the path
of the hunter. This dance as given in Taos today is as ancient as the
earliest human efforts at sympathetic magic, and it leads, as we shall
see later, to more highly symbolic and artistic versions of the same
thing in other pueblos.

Two women lead, dignified figures wrapped in white buckskin robes, or
sometimes in white sheets, wearing the usual white boots, their hair
flowing down the back and feathered atop. At the nape of the neck hangs
the breast of a duck. In one hand each woman carries pine twigs, in the
other a gourd. At certain points in the dance each woman moves slowly
down the line of waiting men, making sharp peremptory motions with the
gourd. As she does this, each man drops to his knees. Returning, she
makes a reverse gesture and the men rise. This perhaps typifies the call
of the universal spirit of fertility, the usual significance of a woman
figure in the Indian dances. They are treated with reverence, and during
this figure the nonsense and the thieving of the Chiffonete are stopped.

When the men dance, the Chiffonete bound about, making jokes and, when
they can, snatching a small child out of the group and carrying him
away. Most of the boys like the fun; if a very small one yells, he is
dropped at once. Usually the thief is caught readily by some man from
the crowd of watchers, though sometimes the race is a thrilling one
before the boy is rescued and returned to the dancing group. This
pantomime suggests the legend of the dance.

Long ago, according to the legend, men and animals lived together and
understood each other. They spoke the

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

same language, and the animals knew that they must be sacrificed that
their human brothers might live. This dance is an appeal to that old
understanding. The Chiffonete who snatches a dancer away typifies the
hunter who tries to kill the game. The man who saves him is the spirit
which always protects the game. In the course of the dance a few
Chiffonete get away with their captives, as a few deer must be killed in
the course of the year. It is said that in hunting, the Taos Indians do
not worry if they are seen by the game, for they know that if the dance
has been properly performed, they will be permitted to kill what they
need.

The dance is performed several times, but it is soon over and the
dancers withdraw to their kiva, still making queer animal-like calls.

In the evening children dance, going in groups from house to house. Each
group gives a different dance, the whole thing being a matter of
practicing for later and more serious ceremonies. Indian children learn
to dance in such ways, following the grown-ups in serious ceremonies and
giving dances of their own before the critical but kindly eyes of the
elders. The end of the evening is likely to bring an adult group which
dances vigorously some such dance as the Comanche dance. Everyone loves
such a night, and every house which entertains the dancers is filled
with eager friends and replete with hospitality and welcome. White
visitors are well received.

*The Buffalo- and Deer-dance at San Felipe*

The Hunting-dances in the Keres Pueblos are a step beyond the
sympathetic magic of the Taos Deer-dance, and

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

a step closer to drama. The costumes are more symbolic, and the
pantomime is more dramatic, being sometimes very close indeed to a play.
The Koshare perform their customary burlesque in the intervals of the
dance, and late in the day the whole troupe of dancers and fun-makers
performs a pantomime of the hunt which often calls for real acting and
which has a distinct dramatic form.

The play begins at dawn, when the only woman dancer goes out to lure the
game into the plaza. She typifies the spirit which attracts the game,
and she is attended by young men, who are the hunters. Always young and
generally beautiful, this girl is chosen by the dancers, who take great
pride in her grace and in her swiftness, for she must be fleet enough to
give real zest to the race. In the low hills which surround the village
she discovers the game; mysterious creatures whose horned heads seem to
take shape from the mist as they move. The girl and the hunters chase
them, a thrilling sight as lithe young bodies flash in and out among the
sandy hills. Inevitably the beasts are outrun, and the girl, shaking her
gourd rattle, leads them into the village, where all disappear into the
ceremonial house for secret rites.

Later in the morning the whole group emerges to dance in the plaza,
where small pine-trees have been planted to suggest a forest. The
dancers appear four times in the morning and four times in the afternoon
for the solemn ritualistic dance, which is the prayer. The chorus enters
first, chanting; then the leader, wrapped in a blanket and wearing a
feathered war-bonnet; then the girl; and finally

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

the game. The buffalo maiden dances demurely, eyes down. Her hair hangs
softly down her back from under a headdress of iridescent black feathers
outlined with white beads like a widow's cap, and topped with the tiny
horns of a buffalo cow. Her white Hopi dress is caught at the waist with
a red sash, leaving one brown shoulder bare. Her moccasins are white,
edged with skunk fur, and she is loaded with jewelry. Her bands move
stiffly up and down in time to the chanting, a gourd in one hand, pine
in the other. Dancing, turning, softly drifting, she is a figure of
beauty among the grotesques who are the game.

The buffalo are played by two men whose bodies, naked above the waist,
are painted black, as are their faces under the heavy shaggy buffalo
heads. They move with the lumbering pace of huge animals, carrying bow
and arrows in the left hand, pine in the right. The elk follow, stately
creatures with feathered head-dresses and turquoise-blue antlers above
the white kirtle and sash. Deer and antelope are similarly accoutered,
each wearing a head-dress made of the horns of the real animal, each
moving in the measure of his kind. There is real art in the unison of
effect which these dancers achieve in spite of the varying tempo of
their steps. The elk are lofty, with heads held high; the deer are
startled and quickly graceful; the antelope frisk so that the feather
fans which make their tails bob over yellow buckskin leggins. Each
dancer bends over a stick held to suggest the forelegs of the animal. In
all these costumes the artist has triumphed over the realist, and the
masks are primarily effective arrangements of color and design,

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

merely suggesting the animal by use of real antlers or horns.

Between the figures of the dance the Koshare appear, dressed as white
men in long-tailed black coats, cowboy bats, O.D. shirts and trousers,
whatever seems to suggest the American. They cut all manner of
monkey-shines and carry on dialogue which is apparently about the game,
as they point and peer in the direction from which it comes. Even during
the dance they carry on their burlesque of the inept white hunter. They
trip over their own guns, they frighten the game, they interfere with
the Indian hunters, they make generally pestiferous nuisances of
themselves and uproarious fun for the onlookers. They are unnoticed, as
always, by the dancers, who continue their rhythmic advance and retreat,
lured on by the spirit of the maiden, breaking away from her, and lured
back again.

Finally the whole effect changes, and the ordered dignity of the dance
gives way to the dramatic pantomime of a hunt. Buffalo are hunters now,
the maiden disappears, and the game take refuge behind the little
pine-trees which suddenly, by the magic of their acting, become a great
sheltering forest. The chant throbs more wildly, the audience grows
tense, and in a few confused moments the animals are killed. A deer,
stalked by a hunter as he flees from tree to tree, is finally struck by
an arrow from a twanging bow. Hit in mid flight, the animal leaps into
the air, falls limp, and expires in the dust with a few convulsive
kicks. Men then rush to him, lift his perfectly relaxed body, throw it
over somebody's shoulder, and carry it off to the ceremonial chamber.
Inevitably all the game yield

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

to the hunters, the last dancers disappear, and the audience disperses
assured of successful hunting for the year.

### SPRING DANCES

When spring comes, the Indian farmer is as busy as the farmer
everywhere. Old grass is burned off, plowing and planting must be done,
and the ditches cleaned. Deep troughs have become filled with silt and
overgrown with last year's weeds. Men go out to dig, leaving the pueblos
in the morning, long lines of them in bright blankets, with spades over
their shoulders. All day they dig, soft talk and laughter and sometimes
song rising above their bobbing heads as they shovel and throw the rich
brown dirt. At night they march home again with that peculiar sliding
movement of the Indian, leaving clean deep ditches ready for the brown
flood which will soon leave the river, make a wide circuit through the
ditches, and bring life and growth to the fields.

When these things are done, the Indian farmer is not content, as the
white farmer is. Nor does he sit back and fear the worst or petition
Congress to do something about it. He goes quietly and assuredly to work
to make things come right. Knowing that there are great hidden forces
which control all life and which he can reach in ways established æons
ago, he finishes his job by calling on the infinite powers to help. He
prays for water, for rain to fall so the ditches may run full. He also
prays for renewal of life everywhere, for many beasts, for many
children. In short, he dances. Certain societies also, very secretly,
conduct

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

proper rites to drive witches away from the pueblos and to clear them
out of the ground that the good spirits may work unhampered.

Among the Pueblos a belief in witchcraft seems to be very general.
Father Dumarest, reporting on Cochiti, says that among the Keres,
witches are thought to be the offspring of a man conceived for evil
purposes. Witch families are therefore not uncommon, and as their
members are not generally known, the Pueblos are very careful to be
courteous to everyone in order that they may not offend a witch and
cause trouble. Not only blights on the crops, but sickness, drought, and
all evils are brought by witches. The curing societies and the caciques
have the power to exorcise witches and are often called upon to perform
that office, especially when one seems pursued by an unaccountable evil,
or when a particular person is suspected of practicing the black arts.

*The Parrot-dance at Santo Domingo*

One day, driving to Jemez, I picked up an Indian. I always pick up an
Indian; partly, I think, in an effort to atone for the injustice my race
has done to his; partly, of course, because I always profit thereby. I
hear tales and songs, I get nice phrases about life and crops and
weather. Sometimes I learn things of great value to me, as on this
occasion.

The Indian turned out to be a friend of mine from Santo Domingo, and we
talked of many things. His child, he told me, was in the government
school now, and it was necessary to teach him much of Indian lore so he
should not

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

forget all the knowledge of the ancients in learning to read and write.
He also told me about the condition of the ditches, and he suggested
that we, should visit Zia on the way home, blandly assuming that he
would also be my guest coming home.

Finally I said: "When are they going to dance the Parrot-dance? I have
not seen it for several years and I should like to see it."

"I dunno," said my friend, that deep impenetrable veil falling behind
his eyes.

So I knew that it was soon and that he would not tell me when. "I often
go to Santa Fe," I said, "by way of Santo Domingo. I might go some day
soon and then I could come to see you. I have presents for your wife and
the boy."

A long silence while we sped along through the aromatic scrub cedars. We
crossed an arroyo in silence. We climbed a hill in silence. We rounded
two curves and finally caught the long sweep of the view where the
buttes suddenly show the rose tone through the purple.

"You maybe come Tuesday," said my friend.

So that was all of that, except that on Tuesday I drove to Santo
Domingo. As I approached the pueblo, I saw Indians standing on the
house-tops, so I knew a dance was going on. In the village I found all
the people out in their gaudy best, men lounging against the walls or
standing on the roofs, women sitting in the *portales* or on benches
built against the walls. Children tried out dance steps here and there
or hung round my car to see if I had brought candy. Not a white person
was in sight. Friends greeted me, and nobody made any objection to my
entering the plaza. The

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> March sun was hot,
and from where I sat I could see how its slanting rays made the low
purple hills look as though they were upholstered in plush.

In the middle of the plaza, framed by houses, kiva, and hills, was a
long line of men and women, dancing. I saw the backs of the men,
seventy-five of them, their bodies painted rose, a turquoise band
holding sprays of evergreen to each arm, a turquoise band across the
shining black back hair and ending over each ear in a trumpet-shaped
flower and two black and white feathers. In the middle of each man's
back was an octagonal shield, turquoise in the center, but edged with
many lines of wool in various colors. Below it spread a huge eagle-tail,
and above it sailed two stiff yellow feathers. In spite of the various
colors of the flowers and the shields, there was a beautiful uniformity
of effect. Black and white feathers fluttered above black heads; the
bodies were all rosy pink; the spreading tails white and black; the
moving moccasined feet rose and fell in perfect time. The dancers sang,
accenting the rhythm with the stamping of their feet, the clash of
goats' toes against the turtle-shell tied under the right knee, and the
gourd rattle in each man's right hand. In his left hand each man carried
the pine, which always typifies everlasting life.

Facing this line was a line of women, their black heads topped with
puffs of eagle-down, their hair hanging long behind and given a demure
touch in front by a band of white dots painted on the bang. The black
squaw dress was almost bidden under a white Hopi mantle or under the
brilliant silk scarfs: orange edged with purple, black and white edged
with yellow, magenta with a figured edge,

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

rich deep blue bordering a flowered stuff. Their legs were wrapped in
white buckskin, and in both hands they carried bunches of spruce, which
moved up and down before them or were agitated above their heads like
young trees tossing in the wind. The measure of the dance was quick,
definite, often changing.

The group was directed by the war captain and three assistants, who wore
fringed buckskin leggins and striped blankets--except one who had
yielded to the charm of a green cardigan jacket. The leader of the dance
bore the basket on which sat the parrot, that mysterious bird whose
knowledge of Southern suns was to bring warmth to this country,
fertility to man and beast and field. The basket was filled with seeds
of all kinds. The leader wore a rare Hopi jacket with unsewn sleeves
which hung loose from the shoulders and was embroidered all over in red
and blue. His long, loose hair was topped with a tuft of blue-green
parrot-feathers. The precious bird, carved of wood and painted all
colors, was not in the least like a parrot. Its tail was a sweeping arc
of all kinds of feathers, and over it arched the rainbow, which unites
the sky father and the earth mother.

When the dance began, the leader stood facing west, holding the bird in
the basket at the height of his eyes. A man and a woman advanced from
the other end of the lines, dancing quickly, the man's left hand resting
on the woman's right shoulder. They were followed by other couples, all
of them making a brilliant, complicated moving picture, topped by the
floating puffs of eagle-down. As each couple reached the leader, he
handed the basket to

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

the woman, who, still followed by the man, turned and presented the bird
to the north, the east, the south, and the west, thus calling on all the
directions to bring increase and plenty. Then she returned it to the
leader and dropped back into the moving line of women, while her partner
joined the men's row, and the next couple advanced.

A striking variation in this dance was the singing of the women, a rare
thing in pueblo dances. At intervals the men ceased their chant, and the
women sang, their voices reedy and shrill, but sweet and true.

Koshare appeared, making nonsense all day long. One drew a fat squaw out
of heir portal and led her about affectionately while his stream of
conversation kept the audience roaring. One had great fun at the expense
of the white visitor. He moved the ladder which was my only connection
with the earth and left me sitting on a roof while he cracked jokes that
it was probably my great protection not to understand. Later, after he
had gone away and forgotten it, other Indians came quietly and lifted my
ladder back into position.

At sunset the dance ended. All the dancers marched away from the plaza
and entered a ceremonial house. Then the leader, standing on a ladder,
threw the seeds from the basket and there was a general scramble for
them. Each year the seeds from the parrot's basket are planted
reverently in the fields, where they will surely bring fruitfulness to
all.

*The Turtle- or Evergreen-dance at Isleta*

In Isleta, just before cleaning the ditches, a day is appointed and they
dance. One old man said: "Turtle-dance.

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> You know, turtle
comes with water." Perfectly clear. If you want water, you bring on the
turtle. Another informant, however, called it the Evergreen-dance and
said that it was the last of the winter series.

A sunny day. The roadway into the plaza is blocked with a wagon bearing
a wabbly sign: "No admission to cars." So has the old spirit of
hospitality yielded to modern ways and the need of protection against
intrusion. The plaza is a riot of color: men in bright red blankets,
women in gaudy Czecho-Slovakian shawls, children in every sort of gay
apparel. Against the whitened walls they move and lean and a few
decorate the house-tops with brilliant splotches of color. The dancers,
all men, appear several times in the morning.

This dance is important and has been preceded by days of secret rite in
the ceremonial house. Two days before, the dancers, mostly young men,
have gone to the mountains for Douglas fir boughs. They leave the pueblo
about ten o'clock at night, walk fifteen or twenty miles, chop all the
next morning, and walk back again. They do not enter the pueblo at
night, but camp near it and come in at dawn. Dancing begins about ten in
the morning, and the group may contain as many as forty men and boys,
nicely graded as to height, the tallest in the center. They are attended
by the war captain and his assistants, oldish men wrapped in blankets,
with fir wreaths on their heads.

The dancers emerge from the ceremonial house on the south side of the
plaza and walk quickly to the east, where they stand in a long line,
shifting a little to get spaced. Then the leader begins the chant,
shaking his gourd rattle

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

and swaying into the measure of the dance. As wind runs along a
wheat-field, so the movement takes the row of dancers until all are
moving in unison, down to the tiniest boy on the end. The costumes are
the usual Hopi kirtle and sash, but every dancer wears a graceful
swishing skirt of fir, a wreath of fir around his neck, and sprays of it
tied to his arms. They wear dark moccasins, and under each knee is tied
a turtle-shell or sleigh-bells. The dancing is simple, the left foot not
leaving the ground at all, the right moving vigorously and in changing
rhythm. Occasionally the whole line faces right or left, showing, as
they turn, the headdress. This is a small *tablita*, cut from wood and
covered with red wool, studded with beads and coins and even tiny
mirrors. Stiff eagle-quills stand horizontally to the left, fluffy
eagle-plumes to the right. Some men have yellow feathers also, a few
peacock tail-feathers. Altogether the head-dresses are brilliant above
the copper-brown bodies, the dull-green skirts, and brown legs and feet.

Around them prank the Koshare, dressed as young Mexican blades were a
couple of generations ago, in tight-fitting buckskin trousers, short
fringed leather jackets. They wear high boot moccasins, and their heads
are lost in badly shaped masks of white, with silly features painted on
them. They are sometimes funny, sometimes not, as is the way with
Koshare. On one occasion they were funny when they took off a church
service. One of them stood solemnly intoning from a mail-order-house
catalogue, held upside down, while the others knelt in the dust before
him. Then he closed the book and began to thunder in wrath, waving his
arms and vociferating in tones that any European audience

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

would have recognized as American. The angrier he got, the more sleepy
grew his audience, until they finally fell over, overcome with sleep. As
a take-off on a church, it was almost too good for the taste of many
whites in the audience. In contrast to this ironic skit, the Koshare
were gentle and nice when they brought a group of children out to play
with them. Gently they directed them in a dance, very tenderly one man
led about a tiny girl of not more than three or four, who appreciated
the fun and faithfully did whatever they told her. The grotesque masks
frightened her not at all, and she had a fine time.

The dance ended at sunset, when the dancers filed in front of the
ceremonial house, passing the war captain in a serpentining march and
finally standing quietly while he chanted a long prayer. Then, followed
reverently by many people, they went to another house. In this way each
group visited four houses, finally disappearing into their own
ceremonial lodge.

This dance is repeated two days later with more horseplay. Early in the
afternoon the Koshare enter the plaza one by one, each swinging a dead
rabbit in his hand. Women, somehow moved, dash out after that rabbit,
and the game is on, the Koshare dodging, swinging his rabbit like a
flail, threatening the women with his yucca whip, both running and
playing for time and position and followed by delighted cries from the
crowd. Eventually the woman always gets the rabbit. Another game has to
do with children. In this the Koshare comes in with a ball of fluff
which turns out to be a live rabbit, a trembling, frightened

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

little thing. Boys and girls swarm around and are marshaled by other
Koshare into two eagerly expectant rows. Then the rabbit is placed on
the ground, where it cowers, frozen with fright until it is goaded into
frenzied efforts to escape. A few futile efforts and it is caught by the
yelling children.

After this, and all appearances of the Koshare, they utter a short
prayer which is an apology to God for whatever offense they may have
given Him, or anyone.

*The Eagle-dance at Tesuque*

Tesuque is a small pueblo in Tesuque Valley, only nine miles from Santa
Fe. The name is interpreted as "Creek with Water in It" or "Place of the
Red Willows." Both names suit, for there is often water in the creek,
which is dry frequently enough to make water worthy of note; and there
are red willows. Along the creek and the ditches, there are also wild
plums, whose fluffy white blankets of bloom go off in the spring to make
way for golden masses of wild yellow roses.

Often when these fragrant Persian roses are in bloom, the Indians dance
the Eagle-dance, which may be done at any time. The plaza is dusty and
dry and nothing grows there; one merely sees the tops of orchard trees
beyond the church, where cedar posts make silvery fences. The little
church has been altered a good deal through the years, but it is still
quaint enough to show that it dates from Spanish days. In front of it
looms a hideous water-tower which proves that Uncle Sam has been there.
Otherwise the two-story terraces, the ladders and chimney-pots might

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

have been made before any white man ever saw the little valley.

The Eagle-dance, I was told, is part of a healing ceremony which will
heal any disease. This is because "eagles are always strong, so they can
cure anything."

The ceremony begins with the four-day fast, and on the third night the
sick are treated in the ceremonial chamber, where an altar has been
erected. In some pueblos the Eagle-dance used to be performed by boys,
but as boys will no longer do all that is required, older men do it now.
The dance on the fourth day is open to visitors. Though danced by only
two men, it is one of the most effective of all pueblo dances, and one
which white dancers always wish to learn. After a few lessons they
readily understand why the dancers must be treated with medicine water
for strength before they can do it. It requires unusual skill and an
amazing control of leg muscles in its stooping, swooping, varied
movements.

The two dancers are accompanied by chanters and drummers, blanketed and
sometimes with the added flourish of a feathered war-bonnet. The
dancers, slim young men as a rule, wear caps of raw cotton running out
into a long, yellow beak over the nose. Their faces are painted yellow,
with a red daub under each eye. The upper body is bare and the kirtle is
a buckskin. All the body, legs, and arms are painted yellow and
feathered with eagle-down stuck on here and there. The striking feature
of the costume is the wings. Each arm is feathered from shoulder to
fingers with the real quills of the eagle's wing. As the man dances, he
moves his body from side to side, swooping, crouching,

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

making sweeping gestures with his wings, which sometimes almost touch
the ground, at others make large arcs in the air. First the two men
dance facing, their knees bent, their arms extended. Then they stand
side by side, rising and falling on their toes as the eagle rides the
air; finally they circle round each other, hopping, swooping, performing
maneuvers of the greatest intricacy with quick steps and inconceivable
grace. The dance is highly conventionalized and at the same time very
realistic.

### SUMMER AND AUTUMN DANCES

At the spring equinox the winter people turn over the conduct of
ceremonial affairs to the Summer People. The time is announced by the
cacique, who determines the date variously in different pueblos. At
Cochiti he goes to an appointed place in the mountains, where he plants
sticks at marked spots, a forked and a straight one. Keeping his mind
and heart free from all mundane thoughts, he waits there, for days if
necessary, praying incessantly. In time the shadow of the: straight
stick will fall exactly in the crotch of the other. Then he knows that
the sun has come to the point, and he returns to the village. The
equinox is thus established and the Summer People take charge. If there
are two caciques, the winter man then yields to the summer incumbent.
From that time on, all the dances are for growth and fructification, and
especially for rainfall.

Many ceremonies precede the Corn- or *Tablita*-dance and are related to
it. At San Juan they make balls of buckskin, filled with seeds, and play
long games of hockey across

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

the fields until the bags burst, scattering their precious life-giving
seeds abroad. At Jemez they hold races on the banks of the streams,
kicking a clay ball or a stick along as the rushing water, when it
comes, will roll up the clay. In that pueblo the side which wins the
race is put in charge of the summer dances.

The outstanding summer dance is known as the Corn-dance, which the
Indians say is a misnomer, or the *Tablita*-dance. "*Tablita*" is a
Spanish word meaning "little board" and referring to the head-dresses of
the women. It is, however, a prayer for growth and fructifying rain. It
is given anywhere and at any time. All the Rio Grande Pueblos dance on
the day of the saint for whom the Spaniards named their village, and
usually this dance is given then. These performances vary from small
badly dressed dance groups of eight or ten in such a pitiful pueblo as
Sandia, which has less than a hundred people, to the magnificent
spectacle at Santo Domingo on August fourth, when there are often as
many as two hundred dancers, perfectly costumed and trained like an
operatic chorus.

This dance is also given in the fall, when the harvest is brought in,
especially if the saint's day comes then, as it does at Jemez, which
celebrates in honor of San Diego on November twelfth.

*The Corn-dance at Santo Domingo*

Santo Domingo Indians are considered, by missionaries and the Indian
Service, as very conservative and intractable. Nevertheless they make,
annually, a gracious gesture toward the prejudices of their white
masters. On August

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

fourth, the day of Saint Dominic, they go early to mass in the Catholic
mission, and all who have contracted matrimony during the past year are
married by the rites of Mother Church. Sometimes bride and groom arrive
proudly carrying the baby smothered under coarse lace and pink ribbons.
The marrying couples stand together in a group while the priest
pronounces them man and wife, and then they and the whole village kneel
reverently for the Christian sacrament. Then the bell rings, muskets are
fired, men pick up the image of the saint, and in solemn procession
headed by the priest, they go out into the sunlight, leaving only the
twinkling candles in the darkened adobe church. Slowly they make the
tour of the village, all the people following, and finally they bring up
beside the kiva, where a shrine has been erected to receive Santo
Domingo. Built of leafy boughs, lined with fine cloths and skins, and
lighted with candles, it is a fitting shrine for any Catholic saint.
Indians in their best white shirts, bright headbands, and moccasins
guard him all day with long muskets between their knees, and many
visitors kneel reverently before him and drop coins into his box. And
there, in the sunny plaza and in the venerable presence of the saint,
the ancient Keres-dance is performed.

There is not the remotest connection between the mass for the saint and
the ancient ceremony. They sit side by side; that is all; they do not
touch.

Later in the day, Koshare come boiling out of the kiva, their black and
white bodies, their whitened faces, their dry corn-husks, and their
rabbit-skins all reminding that they are the spirits of the dead. They
first present a

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

pantomime, easy to read if one has the key. It is a rehearsal of
history: the going-out and the return of runners bringing news of the
coming of the traditional enemies, Navajos, Comanches, or Apaches; for
the Pueblo people always had to protect their crops after raising them.
The runners cause great excitement among the group, who gesticulate
wildly, yell and whoop, run round the pueblo establishing lines of
protection on all sides, and finally summon the dancers whose duty is to
call on the gods for help in bringing the crop to maturity and in
protecting it. All day the Koshare perform many and interesting bits of
burlesque, filling in the intervals of the dance and even crossing the
lines of solemn dancers. One of their duties is valeting the performers,
tying a loosened sash or rattle, picking up a dropped article. Through
it all, the dancers very punctiliously pretend not to see them.

The arrival of the first dance group is heralded by the beat of tomtoms
and the chanting of the chorus which enters first. Often fifty or sixty
men chant, marking time with their bands and feet, and intoning, hour
after hour, the deep, rich call for clouds and rain.

As the chant begins, the dancers appear from inside the kiva, making a
brilliantly effective entrance as they stream down the wide adobe steps
in two long lines of men and women; shells rattling, bells sounding, and
all the sun colors streaming from the leader's pole and flashing in the
costumes. Casually they form in two lines, men and women facing, and
shift for space and position. At the right point in the chant the
leader, in the center of the men's line, begins to lift his feet in the
stamp of the dance.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Men on each side
of him follow until the movement runs the length of the line and all are
dancing. All the time the pole, topped with feathers of sun-yellow, dips
and sways above the dancers, the emblem of the sun's fertility tempting
the rain to fall.

The men, in white kirtles, wear eagle-feathers in their hair, big shells
at their throats above strings of beads, turtle rattles under their
knees, spruce tied above their elbows. They dance with a quick insistent
step, lifting their feet high and bringing them down hard to call the
sleeping powers awake. The women, demure, with soft brown shoulders
above black dresses, move among them, their bare feet shuffling in the
dust, close to earth that they, and all life, may gain from it the
principle of fertility. They carry pine in their hands, which move up
and down in time to the chant, and on their heads are the *tablitas*;
thin board plaques, painted turquoise-blue, the sky color, and cut at
the top into shapes of mesa and cloud. Clouds are typified also in
little wisps of eagle-down on the *tablitas* and in their hair.

There are two groups of dancers, one from each kiva, who dance
alternately all day until sunset. Movements of the dance are simple at
first sight, but they are almost impossible to follow because of the
many unannounced changes of rhythm. In form it falls into two figures:
first men and women dance facing, with occasional turnings of the whole
group; then they form in couples, each man prancing ahead, his head
high, his feet spurning the ground, and the women following, eyes
downcast, movement slow and gentle.

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

Witter Bynner describes it:

Before a saint in a Christian dress  
I saw them dance their holiness,  
I saw them reminding him all day long  
That death is weak and life is strong  
And urging the fertile field to yield  
Seed from the loin and seed from the field.

 

*The Rainbow-dance at Santa Clara*

One of those thunderous, threatening summer afternoons in the Santa
Clara valley. Huge cumulus clouds sitting still in the sky, and a few
dark streaks where rain is falling in the mountains. Santa Clara Pueblo
hot and dusty, with heavy black shade under its few cottonwoods. The
people listlessly gather to see the dance: women dragging chairs to sit
on and carrying babies bobbing in blankets on their backs; small boys
rubbing bare toes through deep sand; and a scattering of white people
dressed in their idea of real Western garb.

Presently the *tombe's* sound, and a chorus of five or six men appear,
pounding along to the beat of their drumming and chanting. Then the
dancers, three men and three women. The men's bare bodies are painted
black, with white across the shoulders, and their faces all colors.
Their hair hangs long and shining, with a fan of eagle-feathers at the
nape of the neck; they wear hanks of red and green yarn around their
waists and under their knees; and they carry willow wands, arched over
their heads like the rainbow, painted in many colors, and feathered at
intervals.

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The women carry
bunches of spruce instead of rainbows and they wear in the middle of the
back a plaque of many colors, surrounded with eagle-feathers. Each one
has a large red spot on each cheek.

The step is not unusual, but the management of the rainbows is. Moving
in the ordinary quadrille-like figures, the men, stamping in accurate
time, make a jumping-rope of the willow rainbow, flying through its
inverted arc like a bird, lighting gently, never missing a step, and
raising the arch again above their heads.

Once as I watched this dance, the clouds suddenly drew together, heavy
thunder rumbled, and big drops fell. I spoke to an Indian standing near
me.

"What a shame that it should rain and spoil the costumes!"

"But no," said he, "this is a Rainbow-dance, and we cannot have a
rainbow without rain first."

Quite right he was too, for the shower was brief, just enough to kick up
the plaza dust in little puffs and then lay it gently. The dancers kept
right on, never missing a beat, and before they ended, the rainbow stood
perfectly clear above the Sangre de Cristo range.

*The Pecos Bull at Jemez*

Jemez Pueblo on an August afternoon; hot sun and cool breeze. Dark
shadows creep along the houses, gradually encroaching on the plaza as
the shimmering rays of the setting sun make a golden cloud of dust
particles in the air. The little river, clear and cold, rushes between
banks heavy with willow bushes, and all the air is sweet

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

with blossoming clematis running riotously along the fences. Vineyards
and cornfields are lush green. All is set, incongruously, against
sculptured buttes of red and saffron stripes, with castellated white
towers outlined on the blue sky.

As the afternoon wears on, women take fragrant bread out of the ovens
and sweep in front of their houses with twig besoms or turkey-wings.
Children scamper and play, an albino among them. Men move about, in and
out of houses and kivas. The real business of the day is in the kivas,
where secret rites have been going on for days, this being the fourth.

The feast of Porcingula is celebrated at Jemez on August second in honor
of the Pecos people who came to Jemez when they abandoned their own
village of Pecos in 1838. The patron saint of the old Pecos mission was
Santa Maria de los Angeles, whose original shrine was at Portiuncula,
near Assisi in Italy, where Saint Francis once had a vision of the Holy
Mary surrounded by angels. In time she came to be known as Porcingula, a
name which is sometimes given to women in Jemez, especially to those of
Pecos descent.

Great excitement prevails when the call comes: "The bull is out, the
bull is out"; and everybody runs to the middle plaza, where the fun is.
The bull is covered with flapping black cotton cloth, painted with white
rings. The head, long, hanging, and not very realistic, is made of
sheepskin and given expression by a pendent red tongue. Underneath is a
man in ordinary dance costume. As he prances, the bull, made of ribs of
willow, careens precariously

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

from front to back, his sides loosely flapping, his tongue wagging. Men
and boys, all of the Pecos Eagle Watchers Society, follow, yelling and
jumping, poking the bull with sticks to mimic bullfighters, putting on
an endless store of monkey and clown tricks; some really funny, some as
pathetically inadequate as most boys' horse-play. All are dressed as
white men with long-tailed coats, stiff hats, faces and hands painted
white, and often finished with mustache or beard. Occasionally the fun
ends in a sprawl of boys in the dust; occasionally it quiets while the
bull goes into a house and receives presents of bread or other food,
which the boys carry into the house of Porcingula..

Finally six stately priests come out of the kiva, chant a short verse,
move slowly the length of the middle plaza, round to the north and back
again, chanting at intervals. They are followed by the war captain. All
wear white cotton shirts and trousers, with red headband and sash and
moccasins, and they form a beautiful frieze as they move against the
sunset glow on adobe walls. As they go, the war captain calls the
dancers to the kiva, his musical voice mingling with the low chanting of
the moving six.

When this solemn interlude is ended, the bull and his tormentors
continue their ragging until finally the bull is lassoed and dragged
into his house. If the boys still have nonsense in them, they may
continue until dark, burlesquing whites in dancing modern dances or
singing modern songs. That the white man commands no particular respect
grows clearer and clearer. In time the boys subside and the noises of
the pueblo run down into quiet, broken only by the hidden beat of
tomtoms where the

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

dancers practice, the distant running of the stream, the sounds of
animals stirring in the night.

In the morning the bull may appear again, though sometimes he does not
emerge until afternoon. When he comes, his attendants come with him and
there is more horse-play. Finally the bull is tied to a ladder near the
house of Porcingula, and a table is set with food which women bring:
women with their gayest silk handkerchiefs hanging down their backs over
the black squaw dresses, their hair shining, their legs wrapped hugely
in buckskin, and bearing their offerings in bowls or baskets balanced on
their heads. Some offer food to the bull, who rests quietly; some touch
him with sacred meal. When the feast is ready, the bull-baiters sit and
eat, indulging in much profanity, unfortunately a good deal of it in
English, as this is also a burlesque of the doings of the whites. The
bull may make his presence known by upsetting the table and spilling the
food.

Meanwhile preparations for the dance have been going on. Here, as in all
the pueblos, the priest sings mass in honor of the patron saint, whose
image he afterwards accompanies to the shrine in the plaza. This image
is the very one which was brought from Pecos in 1838 and which stands
now, equally honored with San Diego, the Jemez patron, in the Jemez
church. After the saint is placed, the priest disappears, for he follows
the Catholic tradition of being unaware of whatever heathen rites may
follow. The rest of the people retire to eat and to await the dancers,
who may appear at any time from one to three o'clock. When they do come,
they emerge in alternate groups from the Turquoise and Squash kivas, the
Turquoise People with

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

their bodies painted a dull powder-blue, the Squash People
saffron-yellow. The dance is the same *Tablita*- or Corn-dance which is
given in all the pueblos and which has been described.

The only notable difference is that at Jemez the pole is not carried. It
has been suggested that this may be because the dance honors an extinct
and not a living people; therefore they do not carry the pole, emblem of
life, which lifts its yellow eagle-feather tip to the sun in
supplication for increasing life for the tribe. There may even be an
ironical note in the whole performance, which does honor to a dying
people, certainly, but which seems to contain a note of condescension on
the part of a people who have survived and who do increase.
