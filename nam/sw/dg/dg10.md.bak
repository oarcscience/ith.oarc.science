# VIII: The Apaches

Apaches are defeated. Pueblos move smoothly between an outward
conciliatory conformity to American ways and an inner adherence to their
own customs; Navajos yield nothing of their own integrity as they slowly
adopt certain mechanical aspects of white civilization; but the Apache
seems completely conquered. Even the casual observer gets the impression
that his capitulation is deeper than any military surrender. His savage
spirit is broken. The first Americans who met him found him shrewd,
keen, even welcoming; later he proved himself the fiercest fighter in
the southwest. His men, and even his women, showed more iron endurance,
and his chief s more resource at strategy and skill at parley, than the
American Army could match. It was only by sheer force of numbers that he
was finally conquered and penned up on reservations; and that was not
until 1887. Now he is sullen and uncommunicative, often drunken and
lazy. In some ways the most tractable of all Indians, in others he is
the most hopeless to reach.

Both Spain and Mexico found the Apache too much for them. They could do
nothing except to barricade their thick-walled adobe houses with heavy
gates and shutters

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

when they heard he was on the war-path. Pueblos were just as terrified
of his very name, which is a Zuñi word meaning "enemy." Early American
travelers, rushing across the desert at the dizzy speed of ten miles a
day toward California and unlimited gold, found the Apache the greatest
barrier across their path. From western Texas to California wandered
unrelated bands of these naked, painted savages: shooting arrows from
behind rocks, hurling spears from the backs of running mustangs, or in
close encounter whirling their war-clubs with enough force to spatter
out a victim's brains. The Apache was at home on the war-path; he made
no settled habitations. He lived on what the country offered: mesquite
roots, wild acorns, prairie-dogs, and rattlesnakes, and on the meat of
the horse he had stolen and ridden to death. He knew his country, inch
by inch: where there was water, where a hidden trail over an apparently
impassable rock wall, where an Indian could lie hidden for hours within
a few yards of a white man's wagon train. He could read a trail left on
rocks or grass and know how many men had passed and when, and how many
horses. He could leave a message for others of his tribe by turning a
stone or snapping a twig-signs which few white men could read. It was
said that white men could travel the Apache country for weeks without
seeing a single Indian, and never be themselves unseen. Then, in the one
hour when vigilance was relaxed, might come one of those terrifying
sudden attacks. Men were killed, women and children carried off into
slavery; and the entire band would disappear like mist, and no Apache
could ever account for the outrage. Charles F. Lummis, writing of wars
against the

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Apache, said that
the great difficulty of the American Army was not in fighting, but in
finding him.

Naturally there was another side to the picture of Apache raids, one
which American Army officers were quick to recognize. And that was that
for every Indian outrage, there was a white outrage just as terrible. If
the Indians could not control their men, neither could the United
States. White men, too, captured women and children or shot them down.
White men sold arms and liquor to Indians. Many savages, attacking white
settlements, were incited by white men's whisky, armed with white men's
guns, even encouraged by renegade whites.

Apaches, like Navajos, could not understand why the United States,
having fought Mexicans, became the protectors of Mexicans. So they
continued to attack Mexican villages, and to talk peace so successfully
that treaties were made and broken faster than the Senate could ratify
them. Real war started when Cochise, a Chiricahua Apache chief, met
American officers for a parley about the theft of a cow and a child
belonging to a Mexican woman. Cochise denied all knowledge of the
affair. The officers, who did not believe him, broke the safe-conduct
and seized and killed the chief's attendants. Cochise himself slit the
tent with his knife and got away. It took ten years of warfare to
capture him after that.

There were other warriors just as clever and just as vindictive, other
officers just as mistaken in their policy. As they had no tribal union,
the Apache bands had to be captured one by one in forty bitter years of
fighting. One uprising did not differ much from another; the end was

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

inevitable. Major John C. Cremony, who fought Apaches for many years,
has left an account of his enemy, which shows that the Major was a
student as well as a soldier, and an officer willing to give full credit
to his foe.

He was impressed with the fact that to the Apache the white man was
always an enemy. He says that he knew of friendships between Apaches and
white men, but in his experience they were extremely rare. The American
was the arch enemy, and even small children would run screaming with
fright from a white man. An outrage against a Mexican was good; one
against an American was excellent. The Apaches knew who would defeat
them in the end. Boys were encouraged to play games to develop their
skill at hiding, at trailing, even at stealing. There is something
strongly reminiscent of Sparta in this Apache educational system. A good
thief was considered even more of a man than a good fighter. "Deceit,"
says the Major, "is regarded among them with the same admiration that we
bestow upon one of the fine arts. To lull the suspicion of an enemy--and
to them all other people are enemies--and then take advantage of his
credence, is regarded as a splendid stroke of policy. To rob and not be
robbed, to kill and not be killed, to take a captive and not be
captured, form the sum of an Apache's education and ambition, and he who
can perform these acts with the greatest success is the greatest man in
the tribe."

Women could fight if necessary, but one gathers that as a rule they were
too busy, for they did everything else except hunt. They built the brush
wikiups which were their homes, and when it was necessary to move, they
packed and

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

moved. They planted and tended little patches of beans and corn between
raids, and they made blankets and baskets. The work was so heavy that
most girls preferred marriage with an older man who already had several
wives, especially if he were a good thief, and consequently a good
provider. So polygamy was general. American Army men reported that
Apache women were on the whole more chaste and less accessible than
Navajo women; and they probably knew.

Major Cremony concluded that "those who believe that they \[the
Apaches\] can be tamed and rendered peaceable under any circumstances,
are wonderfully in error." The error, though, seems to be on the part of
the Major; for the Apaches have not only been tamed and rendered
peaceable, but they seem to come closest to the professed government
ideal of the Indian who gives up his own ways and adopts the dress,
speech, manners, and religion of the American.

The taming process began when General Carleton issued his ultimatum of
warfare against all unfriendly Indians. In the round-up which followed,
many Apaches were conquered, along with the Navajos, and moved with them
to the Bosque Redondo. There they fought with the Navajos, and
unconquered tribes attacked them. When the government began to establish
them on reservations, Apaches came into conflict with white men who
protested against giving desirable land to Indians. So the Apaches were
moved from place to place, subjected to distress, in unaccustomed
climates, and extreme irritation due to the vacillating policy of the
authorities. Many a band, driven to frenzy by unfair

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

treatment, went on the war-path and killed hundreds of whites before
they could be subdued. The best Apache trick was slipping across the
border into Mexico, where American troops could not follow; but the two
countries stopped that by a treaty permitting troops to follow the
savage across the international line. The end followed soon.

In 1885 Geronimo, the last defiant chief, was captured by American
troops in Mexico. He and his band were taken to Florida and put at hard
labor. They were later moved to Alabama, then to Fort Sill, Oklahoma,
and now the last of Geronimo's warriors are on the Mescalero Reservation
in New Mexico. The old chief died at Fort Sill, always longing to return
to his Arizona mountains. He is quoted as saying just before his death:
"The sun rises and shines for a time. Then it goes down, sinks, and is
lost. So will it be with the Indian. . . . It will be only a few years
when the Indian will be heard of only in books which the white man
writes."

Apaches now live on four reservations: the Mescalero and the Jicarilla
in New Mexico, and two in the White Mountains of Arizona. There are
about five thousand altogether. The men hate and resent farming, and
even the Mescaleros, who have fertile land, wander about with their
sheep, goats, and a few cattle. What farming they do is simple. A week
in the spring to scratch the soil and plant, a couple of weeks at
midsummer for weeding, a week for harvesting in the fall, suffice. They
succeed better at herding sheep, an occupation which suits their nomadic
nature and allows some scope for their gifts of observation and their
knowledge of country, of weather, of desert forage.

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Jicarillas are
the most successful; they own sixty sheep per capita, more than any
other people in the world.

Apaches still make tiswin, the tribal intoxicant, and mescal, and they
take readily to American whisky. The problem of drink, for their agents,
is exceeded only by the problem of tuberculosis. Among the Jicarillas
eighty per cent of their people under thirty have tuberculosis, and
schools have been transformed into hospitals.

During the conquest and the captivity, at least a generation lost its
arts. Now Apache women are again making blankets and baskets, and
interested people are helping them, here and there, to get back to the
old designs and patterns.

Of Athabascan stock, the Apache closely resembles the Navajo in many of
his ways. The legends are similar. The Apache uses sacred pollen, though
his comes from the tule cat-tail rush and not from corn. He has
medicine-men, medicine "sings," and much magic. He wore, in his fighting
days, a medicine hat or a medicine shirt to protect him from arrows, he
knew incantations, he recognized witchcraft and magicians. The tribe is
divided into clans, though no organization appears except as the
government has brought it about to assist in administration. Nobody of
scientific attainment has studied Apache ceremonial life as Matthews
studied the Navajos, or Fewkes the Hopis, or Stevenson the Zuñis. Many
ceremonies are lost. Generally the Apache has become so sullen and so
unapproachable that the white man knows him least of all the
southwestern tribes. The old fighter, defeated, holds sternly to his
last stronghold, that of silence concerning his own inner life.
