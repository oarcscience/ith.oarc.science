# Introduction

One day as I walked across the pueblo of Zuñi I fell in with a young
Indian who had been away to school. His hair was cut short, he wore
American clothes, and his English was as good as mine. Yet we spoke of
the Rain-dance I had come to see, he said seriously: "We need rain so
much. You see, the clouds are beginning to come up already, even before
the dancers are out. Yesterday there were no clouds." His ancestral
faith in the power of prayer had not been affected by years of American
education. He still believed.

Soon the dancers came out of the kiva, brilliant in masks and jewelry,
fox furs and fine white buckskin; and for hours we watched them move
through the stately figures of their ancient prayer, accompanied by the
insistent beat of the tomtoms, calling on the gods for rain. Later as we
drove away across the Zuñi mountains, we looked back and saw the long
slanting purple lines of rain falling on the pueblo. Indians say: "White
men laugh at our dances, but they are glad, too, when the rain comes."

As a prayer the dance is a very intimate and pervasive factor in Indian
life. For the Indian is a truly religious

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

being. No act of daily life is too ordinary to be dignified by ritual,
no magnificence of God or nature too awe-inspiring to be explained by
myth and influenced by prayer. There are prayers for birth and death,
appeal and thanksgiving, prayers connected with the planting and
harvesting of crops, the hunt, the journey, grinding the corn, the
storm, the sun, and the rain--especially the rain.

The southwestern Indians are, and always have been, farmers and
stockmen, and they live in an arid land. In New Mexico and Arizona few
crops grow without irrigation, and irrigation depends upon rainfall.
Centuries ago Indians learned to conserve their water in tiny
reservoirs, to direct its flow in well-plotted ditches, and to make the
most of every drop that fell. In the desert, where there are no streams,
they learned to plant deep, to locate their fields where they could
catch any underground flow of water, and to retain moisture by tireless
cultivation. They were the original dry farmers. Both in the river
valleys and on the desert uplands, prolonged drought has always been
their greatest danger. If it does not rain, the people perish. So in one
way or another nearly every prayer is a prayer for rain, for renewal and
for growth. Symbols of rain are everywhere. The plumed serpent, which is
the lightning, and symbols of clouds and rain and rainbows appear on
blankets and pots and baskets for everyday use as well as on shrines and
ceremonial garments. Linked closely with the rain as the life-giving
principle is, of course, the sun. Prayers for rain [often](errata.htm#0.md)
include appeals for all life, animal and human as well as plant, and on
this is based the occasional complaint that Indian dances are obscene.
It all

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

depends upon the point of view. To an Indian, human generation is no
more obscene than is the fertilization and development of a plant.

This book attempts to give a description of the principal southwestern
Indian dances, based upon observation, and an account of their
significance, based upon all available sources of information. It is not
an exhaustive study, for several reasons, the most important of which is
that the material available is not exhaustive. A few scientists have
made detailed studies of a few of the southwestern Indian dances. I have
consulted those authorities, I have seen most of the dances which are
open to the outsider, I have talked with many people, both whites and
Indians, and I have concluded that nobody knows all about Indian dances,
not even Indians.

Ask an Indian the significance of certain movements used in the dance or
of certain symbols which appear in costumes or decoration and he will
answer you evasively. This is often because he does not wish to tell,
but often it is true that he does not know. The cacique or medicine-man
knows the mythology which lies behind the ceremonies and he understands
the significance of the various forms, but his knowledge is sacred to
him and he will not divulge it lightly. The Indian layman, like the
Christian layman, knows merely that certain things must be done in a
certain way because they have always been done so. "Unless we do it this
way, our prayer will not be answered. This is the way of the ancients."

An Indian dance is not a dance in the sense in which we use that term.
It is a ceremonial, a symbolic representation,

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

a prayer. It is, in fact, what all dances were in the early days of the
race before the dance as a social and dramatic expression grew apart
from the ceremonial which gradually developed into the church service.
In a sense the mass is still a stately dance, the theatrical production
is descended from a prayer. The ancestor of both was the ritual
presenting a symbolic act in dramatic form before the altar. David
danced before the Lord. The first Greek drama was a ritualistic dance
preceding the sacrifice. During the Middle Ages Christian priests gave
mystery plays before the high altar, and a modern English prelate has
recently recognized the religious value of such drama by permitting the
presentation of a medieval miracle play in front of a cathedral.
Survivals of these religious dramas are to be found among peasant
peoples in various European countries and even in the United States, for
the Mexicans of both New Mexico and Arizona have certain ancient
religious plays which they give annually at Christmas or Easter time.

Of all these survivals of primitive ritual the Indian dance is probably
the most interesting to be found anywhere in the world, for it is not
merely a quaint custom largely divorced from its original significance.
It is the genuine religious expression of a primitive people which has
survived without serious interruption for thousands of years. It belongs
to the period of human culture before the religious ritual and the drama
had become separate things. The Indian dance is a prayer, performed with
the greatest reverence, and it is also a dramatic representation, as
finished and as beautiful as a modern ballet. Sometimes it has
pantomime, sometimes humor, sometimes only the solemnity

<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span>

of a religious service. Unhappily it is probably true that as young
Indians are trained away from their ancient faiths, the Indian dance
will lose its meaning as a religious form. As an art form it should
certainly be encouraged and preserved as purely as possible. Fortunately
we are still far from the time when the dance has lost its religious
significance even for the young Indian. Even those of the younger
generation who have been trained in Indian schools and have gone away
from home to live, return to their people for the important ceremonies
and show a deep belief in their efficacy.

While centuries of Christian training have apparently not affected the
deeps of the Indian mind, and Indian ceremonials go on much as from time
immemorial, there are superficial modifications which are interesting.
Certain Christian symbols appear here and there and, especially among
the Pueblo people, Christian feast-days are celebrated. In some pueblos
the Indians dance on Christmas, on Twelfth-night, and at Easter, and in
all pueblos ancient pagan dances are given on certain saints' days. In a
few of the pueblos the Catholic priests permit dancing in the churches
at Christmas, probably because they are tolerant enough to realize that
any man's prayer, in any man's mode, is acceptable to God. Apparently
these Christmas dances were originally a recognition of the winter
solstice, a prayer for the return of the sun after his annual
withdrawal. Now the Catholic faith seems to have modified at least the
layman's conception of the meaning of the ceremony. I once asked an
Isleta Indian what dance they would give in his pueblo on Christmas Eve,
and he said: "We

<span id="page_xx">p. xx</span>

dance in honor of the Christ-child." He said it with the completest
reverence.

This mingling of faiths seems to be due to a quality of mind which makes
it possible for the Indian not only to be tolerant of the beliefs of
others, but to adopt them into his own practice. He seems to feel that
every form of worship is good. Indians have always respected the
religion of other Indians, and when the first white men came, they
welcomed their religion as merely a different expression of fundamental
truth. They readily accepted the new faith, but they continued with the
old. Evidence of this dualism is still found in the use of prayer-meal
in the Indian's home, and holy water in his church, prayer-sticks before
the ancient shrines, and rosaries before the saints, and in the age-old
serpent symbol of the sinuous course of streams painted on the
holy-water vessels in some churches.

Most of the Indian ceremonials are extremely elaborate, lasting for days
and ending on the last day or night with the dance. Outsiders are
usually permitted to see only the dance. The secret ceremonies take
place in the kiva or medicine lodge and are open only to clan members or
to the dancers. Sometimes they are historical or legendary in character,
presenting the life of the whole people or of a certain hero. Often
elaborate altars are erected and painted with symbolic decorations, sand
paintings are made and destroyed at specified hours and with meticulous
care for detail, costumes are prepared for the dance, masks are painted
and decorated with feathers, prayer-sticks are made. The dancers must be
purified by means of fasting and medication, bathing the body, and
washing the hair.

<span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Everything is done
under the direction of the cacique or medicine-man, whose duty it is to
see that nothing goes wrong, as the slightest slip may ruin the effect
of the entire ceremony.

From the chronicles of the early Spanish explorers and from the reports
of American Army officers and Indian agents it appears that white men
were long welcomed to all dances, even the ceremonies now held most
secret. As time went on, white missionaries showed a disposition to
impose their beliefs on the Indians to the exclusion of their old faiths
and they naturally grew more and more secretive until now they shut
white men out of the most sacred parts of all their ceremonies and
exclude them altogether from certain more important and probably more
beautiful dances.

In addition to prayers for rain and for fructification generally, there
is an almost unlimited variety of dances, ranging all the way from
ceremonials of the utmost solemnity, in which the gods themselves are
personified, to dances of a purely social and humorous character. In the
masked dances the masked figures symbolize the actual presence of the
god. Ceremonies for the initiation of children at puberty introduce the
candidate to the man behind the mask, much as our children are permitted
to see the man behind the whiskers of Santa Claus. The masked figure is
not the god, he merely personifies the god, and all adults understand
that. The masked figure may also be the messenger of the gods, as is the
great Shalako at Zuñi. After the dance he returns to a secret shrine on
a neighboring mountain, taking the message of the people to the god.
This

<span id="page_xxii">p. xxii</span>

is also the significance of the snakes in the Hopi Snake-dance. The
snakes are brothers of the members of the Snake Clan and they carry back
to the gods the people's prayer for rain. The Yei who appear masked in
the medicine ceremonies of the Navajos are representations of the gods
and are treated with suitable reverence during the entire nine days'
ceremony.

A similar idea is to be found in the animal dances which are among the
winter ceremonies of the Pueblos. Dancers are dressed to represent deer,
buffalo, antelope, or mountain sheep, and superficially the dance is a
pantomime of the hunt, but its esoteric significance is deeper than
that. It goes back to the time when men and animals still lived together
in the underworld; for to all southwestern Indians the original happy
home was underground or below a lake where the gods still live waiting
to welcome the people back after death. Thus to the Indian both the
Garden of Eden and heaven lie underground. It is generally believed that
before they emerged on this earth, men and animals all lived together
and spoke the same language. So in the hunting-dances the performers
propitiate the game by reconstructing the time when animals understood
men and were willingly sacrificed for the good of their human brothers.

As is true of all primitive peoples, southwestern Indians have dances
for the cure of disease, notably the great "medicine sings" of the
Navajos. These are elaborate nine-day ceremonials, which include prayers
and the making of sand paintings in secret, sweat baths and medications
for the patient, and finally the all-night dance, which is

<span id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span>

open to visitors. Through it all moves the stately dignified presence of
the medicine-man. His ability to conduct one of the greater ceremonials
is the result of years of study and training, as he must know every
least detail of the ritual, every song, every sand painting, every word,
and every movement. He is supposed to be a man of great spirituality,
for he is priest as well as physician.

The intense seriousness of the Navajo nature is reflected in all their
ceremonies, which are much less lightened by humor than are those of the
Pueblos. Life has always been precarious to the Navajo. First as nomads
dependent upon hunting and upon occasional raids against the peaceable
Pueblos and later when their marauding days were forcibly ended and they
were confined to an arid reservation, they seem to have felt the
importance of propitiating the gods. Their songs and dances all contain
a note of insistent urgency which reflects a deep ancestral fear. Most
of their dances are prayers for the cure of a particular person's
illness. The patient's relatives arrange everything, and both patient
and sponsors are important figures in the ceremonial. Such a dance seems
to include also an invocation of the great powers for all the people, a
presentation of ancient symbolism, and incidentally an opportunity for a
gathering of the whole tribe. Often thousands of Navajos attend. They
come to assist the prayers for a sick friend and they are most serious
about it. In addition they enjoy coming; they meet their friends, they
feast largely, and they see much magic, for medicine-men can make
feathers dance in baskets and run up and down sticks.

Dances as drama and for fun are found among the

<span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span>

Pueblos rather than among the Navajos. Many pueblos have pantomimic
representations of the coming of the first white men--"men with pale
skins who came across the great water in boats with wings." They prance
about on sticks with such dramatic power that one clearly sees the
*conquistadores* in their coats of mail, and they stage most realistic
sham battles between wild Indians and blue-coated Americans. The Pueblos
still remember that it was the United States troops who first gave them
protection from the marauding Navajos and Apaches, and in these dramas
their sympathy is with the soldiers. The modern American seems to fill
them with less respect and more amusement. Usually he is the comic
figure in the hunt, the man who trails his gun until he falls over it,
who blunders on the game and scares it away, who loses his way and
wanders bewildered for hours around one tiny spruce-tree. Clowns are
endlessly fertile in ideas for burlesquing Americans, and often they are
as funny as our best comedians. Practically every pueblo dance includes
a clown who has absolute license to do or say what he pleases. In fact,
there are in all the pueblos clans of clowns who serve as public censors
by making fun of the foibles of the people.

War-dances are still given here and there. They come closer than any of
the other southwestern dances to approximating the traditional notion of
an Indian dance as a succession of war-whoops and mad gyrations. In a
war-dance one may see real scalps, fine old painted shields of buffalo
hide, beaded quivers full of arrows, ancient flintlocks, and
powder-horns dating from the days of the first American occupation.
Among the war-dances is the Comanche

<span id="page_xxv">p. xxv</span>

dance, which was borrowed from the now almost extinct enemy by all the
Pueblos and which they love to give for inquisitive whites. This is only
one of many borrowings. Indians are inveterate travelers and they love
to learn each other's songs and dances. Sometimes they give them
seriously, as the Jemez give a series of Hopi dances in the fall;
sometimes they burlesque them, as the Zuñi mimic the Navajo Yebetchai.

In the war-dances as now given we have an excellent example of what is
probably doomed to happen to all Indian dances. There being no more wars
among these savages, the war-dances, once most earnest prayers for
strength to fight and win, are now preserved by the Indians themselves
as interesting survivals of a bygone day. In time, as Indians are weaned
from their ancient faiths, it is likely that all their ceremonies will
lose meaning in the same way, and it is important that interested white
people should help them to preserve their dances as an art form when
they no longer serve as a religious form.

As an art, Indian dances command the respect of artists. Dancers,
singers, actors, and painters all recognize the southwestern Indian as a
real artist. Ted Shawn, a great dancer and a deep student of the dance
in many lands, says that the Indians truly understand the spirit of the
dance, a fact which they demonstrate in many ways. They dance in the
open air, instead of in crowded over-heated halls. The dance is an
affair of the whole community, for everyone is obliged to take part some
time during the year, either as singer or as dancer, and always those
who are not dancing or singing are understanding and interested
spectators.

<span id="page_xxvi">p. xxvi</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Most important of
all, the Indian dance has significance. There is meaning in every item
of costume and decoration, in every step and movement. Mr. Shawn and all
who know dancing, agree that the Indian is a fine performer technically.
His foot-work is exquisite, the control of body and breath masterly, and
the careful precision of the whole performance truly artistic. The steps
vary widely, as will appear to anyone who knows dance steps and will
watch them carefully or, better still, try to copy them. Every dance is
full of tricky changes of tempo and rhythm, of the graceful turnings of
long rows of dancers like wheat ruffling in the wind, of that deceptive
appearance of ease which is based on years of training for each dancer
and days of intensive practice for each performance.

The intricacies of tempo and rhythm are based on the music, which
commands as much respect in high circles as does the dancing. Efrem
Zimbalist, who has studied primitive music in all parts of the world,
says that the American Indian's music is the most difficult he knows.
Lacking harmony, the Indian achieves his effects entirely by rhythm,
often combining several rhythms in one song and always using short
intervals and very baffling pauses. It is notable that most musicians
trying to play Indian music fail to catch the correct rhythm unless they
bear it first. Often in the dances one can distinguish as many as four
rhythms used at once, one maintained by the tomtoms, one by the singers,
one by the dancers, and a fourth by the clowns, whose apparent
indifference to the affair gives it the final touch of unity and charm.
Indians often sing alone--love-songs, cradle-songs, grinding-songs,
songs just for fun--

<span id="page_xxvii">p. xxvii</span>

but usually, and especially in connection with the dances, Indians sing
in chorus. In the pueblos a chorus of old men accompanied by tomtoms
provides the music for the dance. The Navajos, wonderfully trained and
controlled, tighten the muscles of the torso and sing while they dance,
keeping it up for hours with no appearance of weariness. There is no
part-singing among either. The voices blend with each other and with the
accompanying instruments and are emphasized by the click of shells on
costumes and the steady beat of gourd rattles. The Navajos use a queer
falsetto voice, whose whining insistent appeal going on all night has a
hypnotic effect even on the listener who does not understand a word of
the prayer.

Lately, with the increasing interest in Indian affairs, white people are
showing a disposition to assist the Indian to preserve his dances in
their purity. Various shows in New Mexico are featuring Indian dances.
At first the old men of all the tribes were opposed to having their
ceremonials presented away from the pueblos or off the reservations.
They quite naturally dread to see the commercializing of their religious
rituals, they hate the effect of applause on their young men, and they
resent all change. Through their influence many dances are not given at
all in the white man's towns; most of them are given only in part. This
resistance is slowly breaking down, however, and it may be that giving
the dances for white audiences will prove the means of perpetuating them
as an art form when their significance as a religious form has unhappily
passed away.

It is still true that the only way to see the best dances in

<span id="page_xxviii">p. xxviii</span>

their entirety and done with real reverence is to go to the pueblos or
the reservations where they are danced in the "way of the ancients."
There you get a sense of the magnificent antiquity behind them, a
feeling of the marvelous strength and cohesion of a people who through
four centuries of foreign domination have maintained their ancestral
worship. We have here, held in modern civilization as in a matrix, a
complete and extraordinarily beautiful survival of primitive life--a
survival which should certainly be treated respectfully and preserved as
an art if it must pass as a living belief.
