Stith Thompson, a Distinguished Professor of English and Folklore at
Indiana University, anthologized these Native American tales from the
ethnographic literature. His chief contribution to the field was his
'Motif-Index of Folk Literature', which is a cross-cultural index of
themes that occur in folktales.

Reading through the traditional folk stories of
[Africa](../../afr/index), [Europe](../../neu/index.md), and [Native
America](../../nam/index.md), it becomes obvious that there are a broad set
of motifs that are appear across geographic boundaries. Is this evidence
of diffusion or something buried deeper in our cultural matrix that goes
back to our common origins? This is still a mystery.

Stories where virtue is rewarded, evil step-relations plot against the
rightful heir, anthropomorphic animals play out very human dramas, and
so on, soon blur together. There are also stories with violent, brutal,
bawdy or transgressive sexual elements. Not all folklore is suitable for
children!

Westerners have been schooled by Shakespeare and TV sitcoms to expect
that all stories will conclude in the final act with all of the loose
ends tied up. This isn't always the case in the dream-like landscape of
the folktale.

Some folklore stories seem to go nowhere, or end in a conclusion that
seems unsatisfying, or have repetitive episodes that appear to be added
just to fill out the story. In modern literature, a story must either be
a tragedy or a comedy; most folklore has elements of both. Folklore
often violates our modern expectations of how a story should be shaped,
while keeping us riveted, wanting to hear more. In this way folklore is
much closer to real life, where 'stuff' happens, at random and often
without any apparent internal logic.

Stith Thompson's contribution was to attempt to make sense of this mass
of material. This seminal book, which appears on the Internet for the
first time at Sacred Texts, is his take on the Native American folklore
corpus.
