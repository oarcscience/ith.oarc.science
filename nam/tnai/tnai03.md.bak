# CHAPTER III

# TRICKSTER TALES\[78\]

## XXIV. MANABOZHO'S ADVENTURES\[79\]

##### (Episodes A and B, OJIBWA: Radin, *Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Canada*; Anthropological Series, ii, 2-3.--Episodes C and D, MENOMINI: Hoffman, *Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology*, XIV, 203.--Episodes E and F, TIMAGAMI OJIBWA: Speck, *Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Canada: Anthropological Series*, ix, 33)

### A

Lake St. Clair, Manabozho saw a number of ducks, and he thought to
himself, "Just how am I going to kill them?" After a while, he took out
one of his pails and started to drum and sing at the same time. The
words of the song he sang were:

I am bringing new songs.

When the ducks saw Manabozho standing near the shore, they swam toward
him and as soon as he saw this, he sent his grandmother ahead to build a
little lodge, where they could live. In the meantime, he killed a few of
the ducks, so, while his grandmother started out to build a shelter,
Manabozho went towards the lake where the ducks and geese were floating
around and around. Manabozho jumped into a sack and then dived into the
water. The ducks and geese were quite surprised to see that he was such
an excellent diver, and came closer and closer. Then Manabozho
challenged them to a contest at diving. He said that he could beat them
all. The ducks all accepted the challenge, but Manabozho beat them. Then
he went after the geese and beat them too. For a time he was alternately
diving and rising to the surface, all around. Finally he dived under the
geese and started to tie their legs together with some basswood bark.
When the geese noticed this, they tried to rise and fly away, but they
were unable to do so, for Manabozho was hanging on to the other end of
the string. The geese, nevertheless, managed to rise, gradually dragging
Manabozho along with them. They finally emerged

{p. 54}

from the water and rose higher and higher into the air. Manabozho,
however, hung on, and would not let go, until his hand was cut and the
string broke.\[80\]

### B

While walking along the river he saw some berries in the water. He dived
down for them, but was stunned when he unexpectedly struck the bottom.
There he lay for quite a while, and when he recovered consciousness and
looked up, he saw the berries hanging on a tree just above him.\[81\]

### C

While Manabozho was once walking along a lake shore, tired and hungry,
he observed a long, narrow sandbar, which extended far out into the
water, around which were myriads of waterfowl, so Manabozho decided to
have a feast. He had with him only his medicine bag; so he entered the
brush and hung it upon a tree, now called "Manabozho tree," and procured
a quantity of bark, which he rolled into a bundle and placing it upon
his back, returned to the shore, where he pretended to pass slowly by in
sight of the birds. Some of the Swans and Ducks, however, recognizing
Manabozho and becoming frightened, moved away from the shore.

One of the Swans called out, "Ho! Manabozho, where are you going?" To
this Manabozho replied, "I am going to have a song. As you may see, I
have all my songs with me." Manabozho then called out to the birds,
"Come to me, my brothers, and let us sing and dance." The birds assented
and returned to the shore, when all retreated a short distance away from
the lake to an open space where they might dance. Manabozho removed the
bundle of bark from his back and placed it on the ground, got out his
singing-sticks, and said to the birds, "Now, all of you dance around me
as I drum; sing as loudly as

{p. 55}

you can, and keep your eyes closed. The first one to open his eyes will
forever have them red and sore."

Manabozho began to beat time upon his bundle of bark, while the birds,
with eyes closed, circled around him singing as loudly as they could.
Keeping time with one hand, Manabozho suddenly grasped the neck of a
Swan, which he broke; but before he had killed the bird it screamed out,
whereupon Manabozho said, "That's right, brothers, sing as loudly as you
can." Soon another Swan fell a victim; then a Goose, and so on until the
number of birds was greatly reduced. Then the "Hell-diver," opening his
eyes to see why there was less singing than at first, and beholding
Manabozho and the heap of victims, cried out, "Manabozho is killing us!
Manabozho is killing us!" and immediately ran to the water, followed by
the remainder of the birds.

As the "Hell-diver" was a poor runner, Manabozho soon overtook him, and
said, "I won't kill you, but you shall always have red eyes and be the
laughing-stock of all the birds." With this he gave the bird a kick,
sending him far out into the lake and knocking off his tail, so that the
"Hell-diver" is red-eyed and tailless to this day.\[4\]

### D

Manabozho then gathered up his birds, and taking them out upon the
sandbar buried them--some with their heads protruding, others with the
feet sticking out of the sand. He then built a fire to cook the game,
but as this would require some time, and as Manabozho was tired after
his exertion, he stretched himself on the ground to sleep. In order to
be informed if anyone approached, he slapped his thigh and said to
it,\[83\] "You watch the birds, and awaken me if anyone should come near
them." Then, with his back to the fire, he fell asleep.

After awhile a party of Indians came along in their canoes, and seeing
the feast in store, went to the sandbar and pulled out every bird which
Manabozho had so carefully placed there, but put back the heads and feet
in such a way that there was no indication that the bodies had been
disturbed. When the Indians had finished eating they departed, taking
with them all the food that remained from the feast.

Some time afterward, Manabozho awoke, and, being very hungry, bethought
himself to enjoy the fruits of his strategem. In attempting to pull a
baked swan from the sand he found nothing but the head and neck, which
he held in his hand. Then he tried another, and found the body of that
bird also gone. So he tried another, and then another, but each time met
with disappointment. Who could have robbed him? he thought. He struck
his thigh and asked, "Who has been here to rob me of my feast; did I not
command you to watch

{p. 56}

while I slept?" His thigh responded, "I also fell asleep, as I was very
tired; but I see some people moving rapidly away in their canoes;
perhaps they were the thieves. I see also they are very dirty and poorly
dressed." Then Manabozho ran out to the point of the sandbar, and beheld
the people in their canoes, just disappearing around a point of land.
Then he called to them and reviled them, calling them "Winnibe'go!
Winnibe'go! " And by this term the Menomini have ever since designated
their thievish neighbors.\[4\]

### E

After this Manabozho began travelling again. One time he feasted a lot
of animals. He had killed a big bear, which was very fat and he began
cooking it, having made a fire with his bow-drill. When he was ready to
spread his meat, he heard two trees scraping together, swayed by the
wind. He didn't like this noise while he was having his feast and he
thought he could stop it. He climbed up one of the trees and when he
reached the spot where the two trees were scraping, his foot got caught
in a crack between the trees and he could not free himself.

When the first animal guest came along and saw Manabozho in the tree,
he, the Beaver, said "Come on to the feast, Manabozho is caught and
can't stop us." And then the other animals came. The Beaver jumped into
the grease and ate it, and the Otter did the same, and that is why they
are so fat in the belly. The Beaver scooped up the grease and smeared it
on himself, and that is the reason why he is so fat now. All the small
animals came and got fat for themselves. Last of all the animals came
the Rabbit, when nearly all the grease was gone - only a little left. So
he put some on the nape of his neck and some on his groin and for this
reason he has only a little fat in those places. So all the animals got
their fat except Rabbit. Then they all went, and poor Manabozho got free
at last. He looked around and found a bear's skull that was all cleaned
except for the brain, and there was only a little of that left, but he
couldn't get at it. Then he wished himself to be changed into an ant in
order to get into the skull and get enough to eat, for there was only
about an ant's meal left.

{p. 57}

### F

Then he became an ant and entered the skull. When he had enough he
turned back into a man, but he had his head inside the skull; this
allowed him to walk but not to see.\[86\] On account of this he had no
idea where he was. Then he felt the trees. He said to one, "What are
you?" It answered, "Cedar." He kept doing this with all the trees in
order to keep his course. When he got too near the shore, he knew it by
the kind of trees he met. So he kept on walking and the only tree that
did not answer promptly was the black spruce, and that said "I'm
Se'segandak" (black spruce). Then Manabozho knew he was on low ground.
He came to a lake, but he did not know how large it was, as he couldn't
see. He started to swim across. An Ojibwa was paddling on the lake with
his family and he heard someone calling, "Hey! There's a bear swimming
across the lake." Manabozho became frightened at this and the Ojibwa
then said, "He's getting near the shore now." So Manabozho swam faster,
and as he could understand the Ojibwa language, he guided himself by the
cries. He landed on a smooth rock, slipped and broke the bear's skull,
which fell off his head. Then the Ojibwa cried out, "That's no bear!
That's Manabozho!" Manabozho was all right, now that he could see, so he
ran off, as he didn't want to stay with these people.

## XXV. THE TRICKSTER'S GREAT FALL AND HIS REVENGE\[87\]

##### (MENOMINI: Hoffman, *Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology*, xiv, 202)

Once while the Buzzard was soaring away through the air he saw Manabozho
walking along. He flew a little toward the ground, with his wings
outspread, and heard Manabozho say to him, "Buzzard, you must be very
happy up there where you can soar through the air and see what is
transpiring in the world beneath. Take me on your back so that I may
ascend with you and see how it appears down here from where you live."
The Buzzard came down, and said, "Manabozho, get on my back and I will
take you up into the sky to let you see how the world appears from my
abode." Manabozho approached the Buzzard, but seeing how smooth his back
appeared said, " Buzzard, I am afraid you will let me slide from your
back,

{p. 58}

so you must be careful not to sweep around too rapidly, that I may
retain my place upon your back." The Buzzard told Manabozho that he
would be careful, although the bird was determined to play a trick on
him if possible. Manabozho mounted the Buzzard and held on to his
feathers as well as he could. The Buzzard took a short run, leaped from
the ground, spread his wings and rose into the air. Manabozho felt
rather timid as the Buzzard swept through the air, and as he circled
around his body leaned so much that Manabozho could scarcely retain his
position, and he was afraid of slipping off. Presently, as Manabozho was
looking down upon the broad earth below, the Buzzard made a sharp curve
to one side so that his body leaned more than ever. Manabozho, losing
his grasp, slipped off and dropped to earth like an arrow. He struck the
ground with such force as to knock him senseless. The Buzzard returned
to his place in the sky, but hovered around to see what would become of
Manabozho.

Manabozho lay a long time like one dead. When he recovered he saw
something close to and apparently staring him in the face. He could not
at first recognize it, but when he put his hands against the object he
found that it was his own buttocks, because he had been all doubled up.
He arose and prepared to go on his way, when he espied the Buzzard above
him, laughing at his own trickery.

Manabozho then said, "Buzzard, you have played a trick on me by letting
me fall, but as I am more powerful than you I shall revenge myself." The
Buzzard then replied, "No, Manabozho, you will not do anything of the
kind, because you cannot deceive me. I shall watch you."

Manabozho kept on, and the Buzzard, not noticing anything peculiar in
the movements of Manabozho, flew on his way through the air. Manabozho
then decided to transform himself into a dead deer, because he knew the
Buzzard had chosen to subsist on dead animals and fish. Manabozho then
went to a place visible from a great distance and from many directions,
where he laid himself down and changed himself into the carcass of a
deer.\[88\] Soon the various birds and beasts and crawling things that
subsist on such food began to congregate about the dead deer. The
Buzzard saw the birds flying toward the place where the body lay, and
joined them. He flew around several times to see if it was Manabozho
trying to deceive him, then

{p. 59}

thought to himself, "No, that is not Manabozho; it is truly a dead
deer." He then approached the body and began to pick a hole into the
fleshy part of the thigh. Deeper and deeper into the flesh the Buzzard
picked until his head and neck was buried each time he reached in to
pluck the fat from the intestines. Without warning, while the Buzzard
had his head completely hidden in the carcass of the deer , the deer
jumped up and pinched together his flesh, thus firmly grasping the head
and neck of the Buzzard. Then Manabozho said, "Aha! Buzzard, I did catch
you after all, as I told you I would. Now pull out your head." The
Buzzard with great difficulty withdrew his head from the cavity in which
it had been inclosed, but the feathers were all pulled off, leaving his
scalp and neck covered with nothing but red skin. Then Manabozho said to
the bird, "Thus do I punish you for your deceitfulness; henceforth you
will go through the world without feathers on your head and neck, and
you shall always stink because of the food you will be obliged to eat."
That is why the buzzard is such a bad-smelling fellow, and why his head
and neck are featherless.\[4\]

## XXVI. THE DECEIVED BLIND MEN\[89\]

##### (MENOMINI: Hoffman, *Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology*, xiv, 211)

There was a large settlement on the shore of a lake, and among its
people were two very old blind men. It was decided to remove these men
to the opposite side of the lake, where they might live in safety, as
the settlement was exposed to the attack of enemies, when they might
easily be captured and killed. So the relations of the old men got a
canoe, some food, a kettle, and a bowl and started across the lake,
where they built for them a wigwam in a grove some distance from the
water. A line was stretched from the door of the wigwam to a post in the
water, so that they would have no difficulty in helping themselves. The
food and vessels were put into the wigwam, and after the relations of
the old men promised them that they would call often and keep them
provided with everything that was needful, they returned to their
settlement.

The two old blind men now began to take care of themselves. On one day
one of them would do the cooking while the other went for water, and on
the next day they would change about in their work, so that their labors
were evenly

{p. 60}

divided. As they knew just how much food they required for each meal,
the quantity prepared was equally divided, but was eaten out of the one
bowl which they had.

Here they lived in contentment for several years; but one day a Raccoon,
which was following the water's edge looking for crawfish, came to the
line which had been stretched from the lake to the wigwam. The Raccoon
thought it rather curious to find a cord where he had not before
observed one, and wondered to himself, "What is this? I think I shall
follow this cord to see where it leads." So he followed the path along
which the cord was stretched until he came to the wigwam. Approaching
very cautiously, he went up to the entrance, where he saw the two old
men asleep on the ground, their heads at the door and their feet
directed toward the heap of hot coals within. The Raccoon sniffed about
and soon found there was something good to eat within the wigwam; but he
decided not to enter at once for fear of waking the old men; so he
retired a short distance to hide himself and to see what they would do.

Presently the old men awoke, and one said to the other, "My friend, I am
getting hungry; let us prepare some food." "Very well," replied his
companion, "you go down to the lake and fetch some water while I get the
fire started."

The Raccoon heard this conversation, and, wishing to deceive the old
man, immediately ran to the water, untied the cord from the post, and
carried it to a clump of bushes, where he tied it. When the old man came
along with his kettle to get water, he stumbled around the brush until
he found the end of the cord; then he began to dip his kettle down upon
the ground for water. Not finding any, he slowly returned and said to
his companion, "We shall surely die, because the lake is dried up and
the brush is grown where we used to get water. What shall we do?"

"That can not be," responded his companion, "for we have not been asleep
long enough for the brush to grow upon the lake bed. Let me go out to
try if I can not get some water." So taking the kettle from his friend
he started off.

So soon as the first old man had returned to the wigwam, the Raccoon
took the cord back and tied it where he had found it, then waited to see
the result.

The second old man now came along, entered the lake, and getting his
kettle full of water returned to the wigwam, saying

{p. 61}

as he entered, "My friend, you told me what was not true. There is water
enough; for here, you see, I have our kettle full." The other could not
understand this at all, and wondered what had caused the deception.

The Raccoon approached the wigwam and entered to await the cooking of
the food. When it was ready, the pieces of meat, for there were eight of
them, were put into the bowl and the old men sat down on the ground
facing each other, with the bowl between them. Each took a piece of
meat, and they began to talk of various things and were enjoying
themselves.

The Raccoon now quietly removed four pieces of meat from the bowl and
began to eat them, enjoying the feast even more than the old blind men.
Presently one of them reached into the bowl to get another piece of
meat, and finding that only two pieces remained, said, "My friend, you
must be very hungry to eat so rapidly; I have had but one piece, and
there are but two pieces left."

The other replied, "I have not taken them, but suspect you have eaten
them yourself"; whereupon the other replied more angrily than before.
Thus they argued, and the Raccoon, desiring to have more sport, tapped
each of them on the face. The old men, each believing the other had
struck him, began to fight, rolling over the floor of the wigwam,
upsetting the bowl and the kettle, and causing the fire to be scattered.
The Raccoon then took the two remaining pieces of meat and made his exit
from the wigwam, laughing ha, ha, ha, ha; whereupon the old men
instantly ceased their strife, for they now knew they had been deceived.
The Raccoon then remarked to them, "I have played a nice trick on you;
you should not find fault with each other so easily." Then the Raccoon
continued his crawfish-hunting along the lake shore.

## XXVII. THE TRICKSTER'S RACE\[90\]

##### (BLACKFOOT: Wissler and Duvall, *Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural History*, ii, 27, No. 11)

Now Old Man went on and came to a place where deer and elk were playing
a game called "Follow your leader." Old Man watched the game a while.
Then he asked permission to play. He took the lead, sang a song, and ran
about this way and that, and finally led them up to the edge of a cliff.
Old Man jumped

{p. 62}

down and was knocked senseless. After a while he got up and called to
the rest to follow. "No, we might hurt ourselves." "Oh!" said Old Man,
"it is nice and soft here, and I had to sleep awhile." Then the elk all
jumped down and were killed. Then Old Man said to the deer, "Now, you
jump." "No," said the deer, "we shall not jump down, because the elk are
all killed." "No," said Old Man, "they are only laughing." So the deer
jumped down and were all killed. Now, when the elk were about to jump
over, there was a female elk about to become a mother, and she begged
Old Man not to make her jump, so he let her go. A few of the deer were
also let go for the same reason. If he had not done this, all the elk
and deer would have been killed.

Old Man was now busy butchering the animals that had been killed by
falling over the cliff. When he was through butchering, he went out and
found a place to camp. Then he carried his meat there and hung it up to
dry. When he was all alone, a Coyote came to him. This Coyote had a
shell on his neck, and one leg was tied up as if badly hurt. The Coyote
said to Old Man, "Give me something to eat."

Old Man said to him, "Give me that shell on your neck to skim the soup,
and I will give you something to eat." "No," said Coyote, " that shell
is my medicine." Then Old Man noticed that the Coyote had his leg tied
up, and said, "Well, brother, I will run you a race for a meal." "Well,"
said Coyote, "I am hurt. I cannot run". "That makes no difference," said
Old Man, "run anyway." "Well," said Coyote, "I will run for a short
distance." "No," said Old Man, "you have to run a long distance."
Finally Coyote agreed. They were to run to a distant point, then back
again. Coyote started out very slow, and kept crying for Old Man to
wait, to wait. At last Coyote and Old Man came to the turning-point.
Then Coyote took the bandage off his leg, began to run fast, and soon
left Old Man far behind. He began to call out to all the coyotes, the
animals, and mice, and they all came rushing up to Old Man's camp and
began to eat his meat. It was a long time before Old Man reached the
camp; but he kept calling out, "Leave me some meat, leave me some meat."

## XXVIII. THE EYE-JUGGLER\[92\]

##### (CHEYENNE: Kroeber, .Journal of American Folk-Lore, xiii, 168, No. 11)

There was a man that could send his eyes out of his head, on the limb of
a tree, and call them back again, by saying "Eyes hang upon a branch."
White-man saw him doing this, and came to him crying; he wanted to learn
this too. The man taught him, but warned him not to do it more than four
times in one day. White-man went off along the river. When he came to
the highest tree he could see, he sent his eyes to the top. Then he
called them back. He thought he could do this as often as he wished,
disregarding the warning.

The fifth time his eyes remained fastened to the limb. All day he
called, but the eyes began to swell and spoil, and flies gathered on
them. White-man grew tired and lay down, facing his eyes, still calling
for them, though they never came; and he cried. At night he was half
asleep, when a mouse ran over him. He closed his lids that the mice
would not see he was blind, and lay still, in order to catch one.

At last one sat on his breast. He kept quiet to let it become used to
him, and the mouse went on his face, trying to cut his hair for its
nest. Then it licked his tears, but let its tail hang in his mouth. He
closed it, and caught the mouse. He seized it tightly, and made it guide
him, telling him of his misfortune. The mouse said it could see the
eyes, and they had swelled to an enormous size. It offered to climb the
tree and get them for him, but White-man would not let it go. It tried
to wriggle free, but he held it fast. Then the mouse asked on what
condition he would release it, and White-man said, only if it gave him
one of its eyes.\[94\] So it gave him one, and he could see again, and
let the mouse go. But the small eye was far back in his socket, and he
could not see very well with it.

A buffalo was grazing near by, and as White-man stood near him crying,
he looked on and wondered. White-man said: "Here is a buffalo, who has
the power to help me in my trouble." So the Buffalo asked him what he
wanted. White-man told him he had lost his eye and needed one. The
buffalo took out one of his and put it in White-man's head. Now
White-man could see far again. But the eye did not fit the socket; most
of it was outside. The other was far inside. Thus he remained.

{p. 64}

## XXIX. THE SHARPENED LEG.\[95\]

##### (CHEYENNE: Kroeber, *Journal of American Folk-Lore*, xiii, 169, No. 12)

There was a man whose leg was pointed, so that by running and jumping
against trees he could stick in them. By saying 'naiwatoutawa,' he
brought himself back to the ground. On a hot day he would stick himself
against a tree for greater shade and coolness. However, he could not do
this trick more than four times. Once while he was doing this, White-man
came to him, crying, and said: "Brother, sharpen my leg!" The man
replied: "That is not very hard. I can sharpen your leg." White-man
stood on a large log, and the other, with an axe, sharpened his leg,
telling him to hold still bravely. The pain caused the tears to come
from his eyes.

When the man had sharpened his leg, he told him to do the trick only
four times a day, and to keep count in order not to exceed this number.
White-man went down toward the river, singing. Near the bank was a large
tree; toward this he ran, then jumped and stuck in it. Then he called
himself back to the ground. Again he jumped, this time against another
tree; but now he counted one, thinking in this way to get the better of
the other man. The third time, he counted two. The fourth time, birds
and animals stood by, and he was proud to show his ability, and jumped
high, and pushed his leg in up to the knee. Then coyotes, wolves, and
other animals came to see him; some of them asked how he came to know
the trick, and begged him to teach it to them, so they could stick to
trees at night.

He was still prouder now, and for the fifth time he ran and jumped as
high as he could, and half his thigh entered the tree. Then he counted
four. Then he called to get to the ground again. But he stuck. He called
out all day; he tried to send the animals to the man who had taught him.
He was fast in the tree for many days, until he starved to death.

## XXX. THE OFFENDED ROLLING STONE\[96\]

##### (PAWNEE: Dorsey, *Publications of the Carnegie Institution*, lix, 446, No. 126)

Coyote was going along, and as he had not had anything to eat for some
time he was very hungry. In the evening he went

{p. 65}

to a high hill and sat down. Early the next morning he started again. He
came to a big round stone. He took out his knife and said: "Grandfather,
this knife I give to you as a present. I want you to help me to get
something to eat."

Coyote went over a hill, and there in the bottom was a village of
people. He went into the village and he could see meat hanging on poles
everywhere in the camp. He went into one of the tipis and the people in
the tipi roasted a piece of meat for him. just as he was about to taste
of the meat he thought of his knife and said: "Why did I give my knife
to that stone? I should have kept it and then I should have been able to
cut the meat without having to pull it with my hands." He asked to be
excused and went out. He went to where the stone was. He said:
"Grandfather, I will have to take back this knife, for I have found a
village of people with plenty of meat." He went over the hills and into
the bottom, but there was no village there. Coyote went back and
returned the knife to the stone. He went back over the hills and there
saw the village and he entered one of the tipis. They placed before him
some meat. He began to chew the meat. He thought of his knife. He went
back to the stone, and as he took the knife the stone said: "Why do you
take the knife away from me? I am now going to kill you."

Then the stone ran after the Coyote. Coyote ran and came to a den of
Bears. He told the Bears that a person was running after him and he
asked them to help him. The Bears said that they were not afraid of
anything. They asked what the thing was, and he said it was the stone.
The Bears said: "Keep on running. We can not do anything with the
stone." The stone was close to Coyote when he came up to another den of
Mountain-Lions. They also told Coyote to pass on, as they could not do
anything for him. After a while Coyote came to a Buffalo standing all
alone, but when the Buffalo found out that it was the stone running
after Coyote he told him to pass on.

At last Coyote came to a place where the Bull-Bats stayed. Coyote said:
"Grandchildren, there is a person running after me." The Bull-Bats then
said: "Enter our lodge and remain there."\[146\] When the stone came
rolling up it said: "Where is that person who came here?" The Bull-Bats
did not reply and the stone became angry. Then the Bull-Bats said: "He
is here and we are going to protect him." The Bull-Bats flew

{p. 66}

up and then down, and they expelled flatus on the stone. Every time they
did this a piece broke off from the stone. The largest Bull-Bat came
down and expelled flatus right on the center and broke the stone into
pieces. Then the Coyote was told to come out and go on his way.

Coyote started off, and when he got over the hills he turned around and
yelled at the Bull-Bats and said: "All you big-nosed funny things, how
you did behave to that stone." The Bull-Bats heard it and did not pay
any attention, but he kept on making fun of them. Then the Bull-Bats
flew up in a group, and came down, and with their wings they got the
stones together again and started it to rolling, and said: "Go and kill
that fellow." The stone then ran after Coyote and Coyote tried to get
away, but he could not. At last he gave out. He jumped over a steep bank
and the stone was right behind him. As Coyote struck the bottom, the
stone fell on him and killed him. This is why we used to find dead
coyotes in the hills and valleys.

## XXXI. THE TRICKSTER KILLS THE CHILDREN\[97\]

##### (ARAPAHO: Dorsey and Kroeber, *Field Museum: Anthropological Series*, v, 101, No. 49)

Nihansan was travelling down a stream. As he walked along on the bank he
saw something red in the water. They were red plums. He wanted them
badly. Taking off his clothes, he dived in and felt over the bottom with
his hands; but he could find nothing, and the current carried him
down-stream and to the surface again. He thought. He took stones and
tied them to his wrists and ankles so that they should weigh him down in
the water. Then he dived again; he felt over the bottom, but could find
nothing. When his breath gave out he tried to come up, but could not. He
was nearly dead, when at last the stones on one side fell off and he
barely rose to the surface sideways and got a little air. As he revived,
floating on his back, he saw the plums hanging on the tree above him. He
said to himself: "You fool!" He scolded himself a long time. Then he got
up, took off the stones, threw them away, and went and ate the plums. He
also filled his robe with them.

Then he went on down the river. He came to a tent. He saw a bear-woman
come out and go in again. Going close to

{p. 67}

the tent, he threw a plum so that it dropped in through the top of the
tent. When it fell inside, the bear-women and children all scrambled for
it. Then he threw another and another. At last one of the women said to
her child: "Go out and see if that is not your uncle Nihansan." The
child went out, came back, and said: "Yes, it is my uncle Nihansan."
Then Nihansan came in.. He gave them the plums, and said: "I wonder that
you never get plums, they grow so near you!" The bear-women wanted to
get some at once. He said: "Go up the river a little way; it is not far.
Take all your children with you that are old enough to pick. Leave the
babies here and I will watch them." They all went.

Then he cut all the babies' heads off. He put the heads back into the
cradles; the bodies he put into a large kettle and cooked. When the
bear-women came back, he said to them: "Have you never been to that hill
here? There were many young wolves there." "In that little hill here?"
they asked. "Yes. While you were gone I dug the young wolves out and
cooked them." Then they were all pleased. They sat down and began to
eat.\[98\] One of the children said: "This tastes like my little
sister." "Hush!" said her mother, "don't say that." Nihansan became
uneasy. "It is too hot here," he said, and took some plums and went off
a little distance; there he sat down and ate. When he had finished, he
shouted: "Ho! Ho! bear-women, you have eaten your own children."

All the bears ran to their cradles and found only the heads of the
children. At once they pursued him. They began to come near him.
Nihansan said: "I wish there were a hole that I could hide in." When
they had nearly caught him he came to a hole and threw himself into it.

The hole extended through the hill, and he came out on the other side
while the bear-women were still standing before the entrance. He painted
himself with white paint to look like a different person, took a willow
stick, put feathers on it, and laid it across his arm. Then he went to
the women. "What are you crying about?" he asked them. They told him. He
said: "I will go into the hole for you," and crawled in. Soon he cried
as if hurt, and scratched his shoulders. Then he came out, saying:
"Nihansan is too strong for me. Go into the hole yourselves; he is not
very far in." They all went in, but soon came out again and said: "We
cannot find him."

{p. 68}

Nihansan entered once more, scratched himself bloody, bit himself, and
cried out. He said: "He has long finger nails with which he scratches
me. I cannot drag him out. But he is at the end of the hole. He cannot
go back farther. If you go in, you can drag him out. He is only a little
farther than you went last time."

They all went into the hole. Nihansan got brush and grass and made a
fire at the entrance. "That sounds like flint striking," said one of the
women. "The flint birds are flying," Nihansan said. "That sounds like
fire," said another woman. "The fire birds are flying about; they will
soon be gone by." "That is just like smoke," called a woman. "The smoke
birds are passing. Go on, he is only a little farther, you will catch
him soon," said Nihansan. Then the heat followed the smoke into the
hole. The bear-women began to shout. "Now the heat birds are flying,"
said Nihansan.

Then the bears were all killed. Nihansan put out the fire and dragged
them out. "Thus one obtains food when he is hungry," he said. He cut up
the meat, ate some of it, and hung the rest on branches to dry. Then he
went to sleep.

## XXXII. WILDCAT GETS A NEW FACE\[99\]

##### (UINTAH UTE: Mason, *Journal of American Folk-Lore*, xxiii, 301, No. 3)

Long ago Wildcat had a long nose and tail. One day he was sleeping on a
rock when Coyote came along. He pushed Wildcat's nose and tail in, and
then went home. At noon Wildcat woke up, and noticed his short nose and
tail. "What's the matter with me?" he asked. Then he guessed the cause.
"Oh! Coyote did that," he said, and he hunted for him.

Now, Coyote was sleepy and had lain down. Wildcat came and sat down
beside him. He pulled out Coyote's nose and tail and made them long.
They were short before. Then he ran off. After a while Coyote woke up
and saw his long nose and tail.

## XXXIII. THE TRICKSTER BECOMES A DISH\[100\]

##### (LILLOOET: Teit, *Journal of American Folk-Lore*, xxv, 303, No. 7)

Two brothers lived at the very head waters of the Upper Lillooet River,
and spent most of their time training themselves

{p. 69}

in the neighboring mountains, for they wished to become great. One of
them became ill, and had to remain at home. After four years' illness,
he became weak, and so thin that he seemed nothing but skin and bones.
His brother grew anxious about him, and stopped his training. He hunted,
and brought in rabbits, squirrel, and all kinds of meat, for his sick
brother. He also threw small pieces of stick into the water, making them
turn into fish. Then he caught them and gave them to his brother to eat.
But no kind of food seemed to agree with the invalid, for he rapidly
grew weaker and thinner.

When the youth saw that no food did his brother good, he made up his
mind to take him away to some other place to be cured. They embarked in
a canoe, and proceeded down the Lillooet River, giving names to all the
places as they passed along. They came to a place they called Ilamux.
Here there was a rock which dammed the river. They made a hole through
it to allow their canoe to pass. Even at the present day it appears like
a stone bridge across the river. Proceeding, they came to a place they
called Komelux. Here two creeks, running from opposite directions, met
each other with very great force. They made the water smooth enough to
be safe for a canoe to pass. Proceeding, they came to a place they named
Kulexwin. Here there was a steep, rocky mountain close to the river.
They threw their medicine-mat at it, and it became flat like a mat.

Thus they proceeded down to Big and Little Lillooet Lakes and the Lower
Lillooet River, until they reached Harrison Lake. All the way along they
gave names to the places, made the waters navigable, and changed many
features of the country.\[46\] They reached Fraser River, went down to
its mouth, and proceeded out to sea to the land of the salmon. When they
arrived there, the strong brother hid himself, while the sick man
transformed himself into a wooden dish, nicely painted and carved; and
in this form he floated against the dam inside of which the people kept
the salmon. A man found the dish, and took it to his daughter, who
admired it very much, and used it to eat from. Whatever salmon she left
in the dish over night always disappeared; but she did not care, because
salmon were plentiful.

The dish ate the salmon, or, rather, the sick brother in dish form; and
soon he became fat and well again. The other

{p. 70}

brother left his hiding-place every night to see the invalid, and to eat
salmon out of the basket into which the people threw their leavings. He
was glad to see his brother getting well so rapidly. When he had become
very fat, his brother told him it was time they departed: so one night
he broke the dam, and let the salmon out. Then they embarked in their
canoe, and led the salmon toward the mouth of the Fraser River.

The salmon travelled very fast, and by the next morning they had reached
the river. As they ascended, they took pieces of salmon from their
basket, and threw them into the different creeks and rivers. Wherever
they threw pieces of salmon, some of the fish followed. Thus they
introduced the salmon into the streams of the interior. "Henceforth,"
said they, "salmon shall run at this time each year, and the people
shall become acquainted with them and eat them." Then the brothers
returned to their home at the head of the Upper Lillooet River, and they
made near their house the hot springs called Tcîq, which they used for
cooking their food.

## XXXIV. COYOTE PROVES HIMSELF A CANNIBAL\[102\]

##### (JICARILLA APACHE: Goddard, *Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural History*, viii, 225, No. 27)

Owl was the one who had arrows. He had a club also with which he killed
men whom he ate. "Up at the low gap I am watching for men, wuu hwuu
woo," he sang. Coyote came walking along in front of him. "Wuu hwuu
woo," sang Owl, "I am looking for men in the low gap." The two came face
to face there. "Now," said Owl, "the one who vomits human flesh will
kill men." "Very well," said Coyote, "shut your eyes." Owl shut his
eyes. When he vomited, Coyote put his hand under and took the meat. The
grasshoppers which Coyote vomited he put in Owl's hand.

"Now open your eyes," said Coyote. Owl looked and saw the grasshoppers
lying in his hand. Coyote showed him the meat. "What did I tell you,"
said Coyote, "this is the meat I threw up." "Where did I drink in the
grasshoppers?" said Owl.

Coyote ran all around Owl. "Because I run fast like this I eat people,"
said Coyote. "These legs of yours are too large,

{p. 71}

I will fix them for you. Shut your eyes." Coyote cut Owl's leg, trimming
away the meat. He broke his leg with a stone and took the arrows away
leaving him only the club.

Coyote ran around Owl who threw his club at him. He would say, "Come
back, my club," and it would come back to him. He threw it again. "Come
here, my club," he called. He hit him with it. Coyote said, "Wherever a
stick falls when one throws it there it will lie." The club did not
return to Owl.

"Now you will live right here in the canyon where many arrows will be in
front of you. Somebody might kill you," Coyote told him. Owl hitched
himself along into the canyon. "Arrows painted black may kill you," said
Coyote. Coyote went around in front of him and shot him with his own
(Owl's) arrows.

After that everybody was afraid of Coyote, who went around killing off
the people.

## XXXV. THE BUNGLING HOST\[103\]

##### (THOMPSON: Teit, *Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society*, vi, 40)

The Black Bear invited the Coyote to her underground lodge. He went the
next morning, and on arriving was kindly treated by the Bear. She gave
him berries and other food to eat, which was very acceptable to him, as
he was almost famishing. Before long the Black Bear put more wood on the
fire, and placed a dish down by the side of the fire. Then she held her
hands, fingers turned downward, in front of the blaze. Before long
melted fat commenced to drip from her finger-tips into the dish below,
which in a short time became quite full. She took the dish and placed it
in front of the Coyote, asking him to partake of the fat, which he did,
eating as much as he was able. After finishing his repast, the Coyote
said that he would now go home. At the same time he invited the Black
Bear to his house on the morrow, when he said he would return her dish,
which in the mean time he would borrow so as to take home the rest of
the fat for his wife.

In due course the Black Bear arrived at the Coyote's house, where she
was treated to some offal which the Coyote had found, but which he told
her was fresh, as he had been out hunting and had just brought it in.
After a while the Coyote told his wife to stir the fire, because he
wanted to get some fat

{p. 72}

to give to his guest. He then set the dish down close to the fire, and
holding up his paws in front of the blaze, exactly as the Black Bear had
done, he awaited results. As there was no sign of any fat coming, he
placed his paws still nearer to the flame, and held them there until
they commenced to shrivel and curl up with the heat, and still there
were no signs of any grease dripping down. His paws had now almost
shrunk up into a ball. He was unable to endure the pain any longer,
withdrew his hands from the fire, and ran around the house, howling with
pain. The Black bear then said to him, "What a fool you are! Poor
fellow! Watch me how I do it." She then held up her paws in front of the
fire, as she had done on the previous day, and before long the dish was
full of grease. She then made the Coyote a present of the grease, and
told him never to try and do what was beyond his power.

Sometime afterwards the Coyote felt hungry and thought he would pay a
visit to Tsalas, who lived in an underground lodge some little distance
away. Upon entering, Tsalas treated him kindly, telling him that he
would go and get some fresh fish for him to eat. He went outside, took a
withe from some neighboring bushes, and went down to the river, where he
made a small hole in the ice, and commenced to dive for fish. The
Coyote, meanwhile, watched all his movements from the top of the ladder.
Before long, Tsalas had caught a goodly number of fish, which he strung
on the withe, and returning home, cooked some of them for the Coyote,
who soon ate his fill.

On leaving, the Coyote invited Tsalas to visit him at his house on the
morrow. Accordingly, the next day, Tsalas repaired to the Coyote's
house, where he was offered old meat; but, unlike the Black Bear, he was
not fond of such food. Therefore the Coyote proposed to go and get some
fresh fish for him. The Coyote left the house, took a withe, and after
making a hole in the ice put his head down the hole in order to look for
the fish before diving. But in trying to get his head out again he found
that he could not. Wondering at this long absence, Tsalas went to look
for his friend, and found him with his head stuck down in the ice-hole.
He pulled him out, more dead than alive, and addressing him, said, "Poor
fellow! Why should you make yourself worse off than you already are? You
are very foolish to try to do things that are beyond your powers. Now
look at me!" Tsalas then put his head down in the

{p. 73}

hole and soon commenced to toss plenty of fish out on the ice. He made a
present of them to the Coyote, and went home, leaving the Coyote in
anything but a pleasant mood.

Some time afterwards the Coyote went to the mountains to watch the
Magpie and learn his methods of hunting. The latter had set a net-snare
close by his underground lodge. He went up the mountains, singled out a
large buck deer, which he teased, and called names, such as "big
posterior," "hairy posterior," "short-tail." The buck at last grew angry
and charged the Magpie, who ran away. He just kept a little ahead of the
buck, so as to encourage him, and led him right into the snare, in which
his antlers stuck fast, whilst the Magpie jumped over it, and turning
round, stabbed the entangled buck to death. The Coyote made up his mind
that he would do as the Magpie had done. So he placed a net-snare close
by his house, and, going up the mountains, soon fell in with a buck
deer, whom he commenced to belittle and slander, calling him all kinds
of nasty names, just as the Magpie had done. The buck grew angry,
charged the Coyote, who made for home, where his snare was, with the
buck close after him. On reaching the net, the Coyote tried to jump over
it, but failed to do so. He fell into the net and became entangled in
it. Then the buck began to prod him with his antlers, and would have
killed him if the people had not run out and prevented it by killing the
buck.

## XXXVI. COYOTE AND PORCUPINE\[104\]

##### (NEZ PERCÉ: Spinden, *Journal of American Folk-Lore*, xxi, 21, No. 9)

Once Porcupine was going along the river bank looking for food. Soon he
saw some fine, fat buffalo, ten of them, just across the river. Then
Porcupine wanted to get across the river, but could not. After some
thought he called to the buffalo to stand in line. This was so that he
could tell which one was the fattest. Then he picked out the fattest one
and told him to swim across the river. When this buffalo came up to
Porcupine, he asked Porcupine where he wanted to sit, on his back or on
his tail. Porcupine answered, "I would rather be under your forelegs, so
I shall not drown."

The buffalo agreed. When they were nearly across, Porcupine struck the
buffalo under the foreleg with a large knife. So he killed that buffalo,
but the others ran away.

{p. 74}

Porcupine was looking for something with which to sharpen his knife. He
was singing, "I wish I could find something with which to sharpen my
knife, for I haven't had any fat buffalo yet." Now, Coyote happened to
be going by and he heard Porcupine singing. Coyote came up to him and
Porcupine was afraid. Coyote asked him what he was singing, and
Porcupine answered, "I was not singing anything, I was just saying I
wish I had some string for my moccasin." Coyote said, "No, you did not
say that; I heard what you said." Porcupine said nothing more; so Coyote
told him what he had killed. Coyote said, "Now, I have a sharp knife, so
I can help you." Then Coyote said, "Let us try jumping over the buffalo;
the one who jumps over may have it all. I'll try first." Coyote
succeeded, but Porcupine did not, so Coyote got all the meat. Then
Coyote took his sharp knife and cut Porcupine's head, but did not kill
him.

Now, Coyote had some children: one of them was with him, and the rest
were at home. Coyote said to his child, "I am going after the other
children. You watch the old Porcupine, and if he gets up you call me and
I will come back and kill him." When Coyote was gone, Porcupine got up.
The young Coyote cried, "Father, Porcupine is up." Then Coyote hurried
back and asked his baby what the matter was. The child said, "He was
trying to take some of the buffalo meat, but now he is quiet again."
Coyote started off a second time. When he was a great way off Porcupine
got up. The child called his father, but this time in vain. Porcupine
struck the young Coyote with a stone and killed him. Then he set the
child up under a tree and stuffed his mouth full of buffalo fat. Then
Porcupine took all the meat to the top of a tree and watched for Coyote
and his family to come.

When Coyote with his wife and children had come up close, Coyote said to
the children, "Look at your brother; he is eating and having a great
time." But when they arrived they saw that the baby was killed and had
his mouth stuffed with fat. Then Coyote was very angry. He wondered
where Porcupine had gone. When Coyote looked up he saw Porcupine sitting
in a tall tree laughing. Coyote said, "Please come down"; but Porcupine
answered, "I do not like you because you are trying to cheat me out of
my buffalo meat." Coyote said, "Just give us a little piece of fat or
meat." Then Porcupine

{p. 75}

told Coyote and his family to all stand together under the tree. They
did this. Then Porcupine dropped the buffalo head down on them and they
were all killed.

## XXXVII. BEAVER AND PORCUPINE\[106\]

##### (TLINGIT: Swanton, *Bulletin of the Bureau of American Ethnology*, xxxix, 220, No. 63)

The beaver and the porcupine were great friends and went about
everywhere together. The porcupine often visited the beaver's house, but
the latter did not like to have him come because he left quills there.
One time, when the porcupine said that he wanted to go out to the
beaver's house, the beaver said, "All right, I will take you out on my
back." He started, but instead of going to his house he took him to a
stump in the very middle of the lake. Then he said to him, "This is my
house," left him there, and went ashore.

While the porcupine was upon this stump he began singing a song, "Let it
become frozen.\[107\] Let it become frozen so that I can cross to
Wolverine-man's place." He meant that he wanted to walk ashore on the
ice. So the surface of the lake froze, and he walked home.

Some time after this, when the two friends were again playing together,
the porcupine said, "You come now. It is my turn to carry yon on my
back." Then the beaver got on the porcupine's back, and the porcupine
took him to the top of a very high tree, after which he came down and
left him. For a long time the beaver did not know how to get down, but
finally he climbed down, and they say that this is what gives the broken
appearance to tree bark.\[4\]

## XXXVIII. THE BIG TURTLE'S WAR PARTY\[108\]

##### (SKIDI PAWNEE: Dorsey, *Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society*, viii, 274, No. 74)

A turtle went on the warpath, and as he went along, he met Coyote, who
said: "And where are you going, grandson?" The turtle said: " I am on
the warpath." Coyote said: "Where are you going?" "I am going to a camp
where there are many people," said the turtle. "Let me see you run," the
turtle said. Coyote ran. The turtle said: "You cannot run fast; I do not
want you."

{p. 76}

The turtle went on, and he met a fox. "Well, brother," said the fox,
"where are you going?" "I am going on the warpath," said the turtle.
"Where are you going?" said the fox. "I am going where there are many
people," said the turtle. "Can I go with you?" said the fox. The turtle
said: "Let me see you run." The fox ran, and he went so fast that the
turtle could hardly see him. The turtle said: "You cannot run fast; I do
not want you."

The turtle then went on, and a hawk flew by him, and the hawk heard the
turtle say: "I am on the warpath, I am looking for people to join me."
The hawk said: "Brother, what did you say?" "I am on the warpath," said
the turtle. "Can I join you?" said the hawk. "Let me see you fly your
best," said the turtle. The hawk flew so fast that the turtle could not
see him for a while. When the hawk came back, the turtle said: "You
cannot fly fast; I do not want you."

Again the turtle went on, and kept on saying: "I am on the warpath, I am
looking for people to join me." A rabbit jumped up and said: "Can I go
along?" "Let me see you run," said the turtle. The rabbit ran, and ran
fast. The turtle said: "You cannot run fast; I do not want you."

The turtle went on, saying: "I am looking for people to join me." Up
jumped a flint knife and said: "Brother, can I join you?" "You may if
you can run fast," said the turtle; "let me see you run." The knife
tried to run, and could not. "You will do," said the turtle; "come with
me."

They went on, and the turtle was saying: "I am looking for people to go
on the warpath with me." Up jumped a hairbrush. "What did you say?" said
the brush. "I am on the warpath," said the turtle. "Can I go along?"
said the brush. The turtle said: "Let me see you run." The brush tried
to run, but could not. The turtle said: "You will do; come with us."

They went on, and the turtle was saying: "I am on the warpath, I am
looking for people to join me." Up jumped an awl, and it said: "Can I
join you?" The turtle said: "Let me see you run." The awl tried to run,
but could not. "You will do," said the turtle; "come with us."

So the four went on, and they came to a big camp, and the turtle sent
the knife into camp. The knife went into camp, and one man found it,
took it home, and while trying to cut meat

{p. 77}

the man cut his fingers, and threw the knife at the doorway. The knife
went back to the turtle and said: "I was picked up, and while the man
was trying to cut meat, I cut his hand and he threw me at the doorway,
so I came back."

The turtle said: "Very well. Now, Brush, you go and see what you can
do." So the brush went into camp, and a young girl picked it up and
commenced to brush her hair. The brush pulled the girl's hair out, so
that the girl threw the brush at the doorway, and it came back. It said:
"Brother Turtle, there is a young girl who has lovely hair. She used me
on her head, and I pulled on her hair, so that she threw me away. See I
have her hair here." "Well done," said the turtle.

"Now, Awl, go and be brave," said the turtle. The awl went into camp,
and an old woman picked it up. She began to sew her moccasins, and all
at once she stuck the awl in one of her fingers. The woman threw it
away, and it came back and said: "Brother Turtle, I hurt a woman badly.
She was using me while she was sewing her moccasins, and I stuck one of
her fingers; she threw me away." "Well done, brothers, now it is my
turn," said the turtle.

The turtle went into camp, and people saw him and said: "What does this
mean? Look at Turtle; he is on the warpath. Let us kill him." So they
took him, and people said: "Let us spread hot coals and put him in
there." "All right," said the turtle, "that will suit me for I will
spread out my legs and burn some of you." People said: "True, let us
then put a kettle over the fire, and when the water boils let us put him
in." The turtle said: "Good! Put me in, and I will scald some of you."
People said: "True! Let us throw him into the stream." The turtle said:
"No, do not do that. I am afraid, I am afraid!" People said: "He is
afraid of water; let us throw him in there." But the turtle hallooed the
more: "I am afraid! Do not throw me in the water!" So the people threw
the turtle in the water. The turtle came up to the surface and said: "I
am a cheat. Heyru! Heyru!" poking his tongue out.

The people picked up the knife, awl, and brush and used them. The turtle
stayed in the water, and every time the people went to the water, Turtle
would say: "I cheated you; water is my home." People would throw stones
at it, and it would dive.\[109\]
