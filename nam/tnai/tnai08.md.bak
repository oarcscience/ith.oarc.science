# TALES BORROWED FROM EUROPEANS\[288\]

Well-established titles to European tales have been retained, even
though in some instances their appropriateness to the American Indian
borrowings is not immediately apparent.

## LXXVIII. THE SEVEN-HEADED DRAGON\[219\]

##### (OJIBWA: Skinner, Journal of American Folk-Lore, XXIX, 330, No. 1)

THERE was once an old man living alone with his wife. They had a horse
and one dog, a spaniel. They hunted and fished only in the big lake.
Once upon a time they could not get any fish in the nets, and they were
very hungry. The man went to look after his net in the morning, and
found a jackfish with a large head. As he was going to kill the fish, it
said, "Hold on, old man! Don't kill me right away!" The old man stopped,
and the fish told the old man to take all its scales off and not to lose
any, and to go and put these in the garden. It also told him to cut off
its fins and place them in the garden, to cut its head off and give it
to his wife to eat, half of its body to be fed to the dog, and the other
end to the horse. He told the old man to shut the stable, but not to
look at it for four days and four nights, and not to look at the scales
for four days and four nights, but each morning after that he could
look. The old man then killed it and took it home. He told his wife
about it; and she asked, "Is that true?"--"Yes," answered the old man,
and repeated all. "We will obey. We are poor and hungry; maybe we shall
have good luck." He scaled and cut the fish and put it in the garden. He
also fed his wife, dog, and horse as he had been told, and shut the
stable. For four days and nights he could not sleep. His wife became
pregnant;\[166h\] and on the fourth morning she had two sons, and the
old man was glad. He ran to the stable, and found that the mare had two
foals, the dog two pups. He went to the garden, and there was silver
money where the scales had been placed. There were two fine swords where
the fins had been. The old man ran in to tell his wife what had
happened, and they were delighted. After that the old man caught many
fish. Soon his boys grew up.

{p. 202}

One time, when they were home in the evening, the elder boy said, "Are
there any other people in the world?"--"Certainly, there are many
people."--"Where can I find them?"--"You can find them anywhere." The
youth said, "I will start to-morrow to try to visit some people." He
left his sword, and told his brother, "I shall take yours, and leave
mine hanging here. Do not touch it! If I have trouble or if I am killed,
it will become rusty."\[149\] Then he went off. About dinner-time he
dismounted and drank from a spring. He found silver water; and when he
dipped his little finger into it, it became solid silver. He put some of
the water on the horse's ears, and they became silver. He did the same
to the dog's and also on his own hair. Then he started off.

When he came to a large town, he took off his clothes, found some old
ones, and put rags around his finger and a handkerchief over his hair.
He had a little box in which he put the horse and dog after making them
small and hid them in a blacksmith's shop. The blacksmith looked at him.
"Where are you from?"--"Is there a town here? I am very poor."--"Oh,
come in!" The blacksmith fed him. The man said, "I can keep you here,"
and engaged him to do the chores in the house. He staid there a while,
when one night the blacksmith came home and said, "The king of this town
has a fine daughter, and she is going to be fed to the Windigo that has
eight heads. He eats only people."--"When is she going to be taken
there?"--"To-morrow morning."

The next day, after his work, the young man went out. He mounted his
horse, took his dog, put on his own clothes, and rode out of the city.
After a while he heard some one weeping in the woods. He turned in that
direction, and found a young girl who was crying. She stopped when she
saw him. The young man asked her, "Why are you crying?"--"There is no
use telling you."--"Oh, no! tell me! Where are you going?"--"There is no
use telling you."--"Oh, yes! you must tell me." Then the girl, seeing
that he was a stranger, said, "I will tell you. I am going to yonder
bluff. There is an eight-headed manitou there, and I am going to be
eaten by him."--"Why?"--"He wants me."--"What if you do not go?"--"Then
he would devour every one in the city. Therefore I must go."

Then the youth said, "I will go first. You can go when I come
back."--"No, No! you must not go. I am not going

{p. 203}

there for life, I am going there to die."--"If that is so, I must see
him first."--"Oh, no!" The young man said, "I will go and come back. You
stay here."--"Well, go on! but he will kill you," and she gave the boy a
ring. He then went to the bluff, and saw that the trees were shaken by
the breath of the manitou. He stopped, and said to his horse and dog,
"Try as hard as you can to help me," and then he rode on. The horse and
dog sank deep into the soil. The boy took his sword and cut off one
head, which sprang back again. Then he told his dog to catch it;. and he
hit the monster again, cutting off another of his heads. The dog seized
it and shook it. The youth cut off another one, and the horse kicked it.
When he had cut off four heads, the manitou was not breathing very
strongly. Finally he killed him. He cut out all the tongues and put them
in a handkerchief. When he came back, he found the girl waiting, and
told her that he had killed the manitou. He told the girl to go home and
take the tongues with her, but not to tell who killed the manitou. "Give
the tongues to your father, and say that a young fellow did it, but that
you do not know who."

The blacksmith was working at home. "Where are you going,--home? No, you
have to be eaten by the manitou."--"The manitou has been
killed."--"Nobody can kill him." The girl showed him the tongues. Then
the blacksmith believed her, and asked her who had killed him. "I do not
know, he is a youth."--"Go home and tell your father that I killed him.
If you don't, I will kill you." The girl agreed, and he went with her.
Her father and mother asked her why she had come back, and she told them
that the blacksmith had killed the manitou. She called him in, and they
asked him, "How did you do it?"--"I hit his tongues."

The king was very glad, and gave the girl to the blacksmith. The youth
went home, put his horse back into the box, and dressed in his old
clothes.

There was to be a four-days' dance before the wedding. After three
night's dance, the blacksmith was very glad, and told the boy that this
was the last night. Then the lad put on his clothes. He came into the
lodge and sat down by the door. The girl knew him at once, and told her
father secretly that he had slain the monster. The king invited him to a
better place. The blacksmith wanted to go out, pretending that his

{p. 204}

stomach pained him, but he was not allowed to leave. He was locked up,
taken to the sea, and thrown in. The youth married the girl; and the
king gave him half of the town, half of his money, and half of
everything he owned, he was so glad that his daughter had been saved.

They went upstairs into their rooms. There was a window at the top on
the east side of the house, and from there could be seen a blue fire at
a distance.

"What kind of fire is that?" asked the youth.

"Do not ask about it," said the princess, "and never go near it."

On the next day he took his little horse and dog and went to the fire.
There he saw an old, long house. He entered the first room, but there
was no one there. After a while he heard some one. The door opened, and
a white-headed old woman came in, and said, "Grandchild, hold your
little dog, he will bite me. I am cold."--"Warm yourself, the dog will
not touch you."--"You must tie him"--"I have nothing to tie him with."
So the old lady gave him one hair, and said, "*Nosis*, tie him with
that." The youth did so, and also tied the horse. The old woman had a
cane. She touched him with it on the feet, and he died.

One morning the other youth, who had been left at home, saw rust on the
sword. He said to his father, " I fear brother is dead somewhere, for
his sword is rusty. I must go and try to find him." His father
consented, and told him to be careful.

The next morning the elder brother left. About noon he found the same
spring, and did as his brother had done. In the evening he came to the
city and went to the chief's house. The girl came out and kissed him,
and asked him where he had been, but he did not answer. They had supper,
and he thought to himself "That must be my brother's wife." At night he
refused to go to bed. Through the window he saw the blue fires. He
asked, "What kind of fires are those?"--"Why did you not go over to
see?"

In the morning he went there. When he arrived there, he saw his
brother's horse and dog tied with brass wire, lying down and frozen to
death. He went into the lodge, and saw that his brother also lay dead by
the fire. Soon he heard some one coming. An old woman appeared, and
said, "I am cold."--"Warm yourself by the fire."--"First tie your little
dog."

{p. 205}

He refused to do so, and finally said, "Now, granny, make that man and
horse and dog alive! If you do not do so at once, I shall send the dog
after you."--"*Nosis*, I cannot bring a dead man to life"--"You have
to."--"No."

Then he set his dog on her. The dog bit her, and the horse kicked her.

"Stop! I'll bring them to life." He stopped the animals, and the old
woman walked forward. The youth kept away from her cane. She told him to
take up a little bottle and put it on his frozen brother. As soon as he
dropped some of the liquid from the bottle into his mouth, he came to.
She did the same to the dog and to the horse. Then the brothers killed
the old woman. They took the bottle away from her and went home. As.
they rode along together, the elder brother said, "You must be married.
Yes. Your wife mistook me for you, but I only let her sleep with my arm.
That's how I found out."

The younger brother, on hearing this, became jealous. He drew back and
shot his brother with his revolver. He also shot his dog and horse. Then
he went home, and his wife was glad to see him. She asked him why he
refused to sleep with her last night. "You only let me have your hand."
Then the brother began to sorrow for his brother. He took his horse and
went back to the corpse. There he wept over his brother. His little dog
ran around the dead body, and began to look inside the coat. There he
found the old woman's little bottle. He put some of the liquid on the
wound, and thus brought the brother back to life. Then he dropped some
on the dog and the horse, and they all came to. They went home, put
their horses and dogs away, entered the lodge, and sat down. The younger
one's wife saw them, and was unable to tell them apart. On the following
day they started to return to their parents. When they came to a forked
road, they decided to go in different directions. The elder one took one
road, and said, "I will go this way, and my name will be God." The other
said, "I will follow the other, and I will be the Devil." That's the end
of it.

## LXXIX. JOHN THE BEAR\[290\]

##### (ASSINIBOIN: Lowie, Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural History, iv, 147)

A man was living with his wife. It was summer. The woman was pregnant.
One day, while she was picking berries, a big

{p. 206}

bear saw and abducted the woman, whom he kept in his cave. Before
spring, the woman gave birth to a child begotten by her first husband,
but with plenty of hair on his body, wherefore he was called Icmá
(Plenty-of-Hair). In the spring the bear came out of his cave. The boy
looked outside and told his mother, "We had better run away to where you
first came from." But the bear had stopped up the entrance with a big
rock, and the woman said, "We can't get out, the rock is too heavy." The
boy tried it, and was able to lift it. They fled before the bear
returned. They were already near the Indian camp when they heard the
bear coming in pursuit. The woman was exhausted, but the boy packed her
on his back and ran to the camp. At first, the woman went to a
stranger's lodge. Then someone told her husband that his wife was back.
The chief then took both her and his son home.

The boy used to play with other boys. Once he quarreled with one of them
and killed him with a single blow. This happened again on another
occasion. Then Icmá said to his father, "I don't like to kill any more
boys; I'll go traveling." He started out and met two men, who became his
comrades. One of them was called Wood-Twister, the other Timber-Hauler.
They got to a good lodge, and decided to stay there together. On the
first day, Icmá and Wood-Twister went hunting. They bade Timber-Hauler
stay home and cook. While they were away, an ogre that lived in the
lodge came out, threw Timber-Hauler on his back, and killed him. The two
other men found him dead, but Icmá restored him to life. The next day
Icmá said, "Wood-Twister, you stay home, I'll go hunting with
Timber-Hauler." At sunset Wood-Twister began cutting firewood. He saw
something coming out of the lodge that looked like a man, but wearing a
beard down to its waist and with nails as long as bear-claws. It
assaulted Wood-Twister, who was found dying by his friends, but was
restored by Icmá. The next day Icmá said "You two go hunting, I will
stay home." As he was beginning to chop wood, the monster appeared and
challenged him to fight. Icmá seized its head, cut it off, and left the
body in the lodge. When his comrades returned, Icmá asked them, "Why did
not you kill him like this?" Then he said, "I don't like this house; let
us, go traveling."

They started out and got to a large camp. The chief said, "My three
daughters have been stolen by a subterranean being.

{p. 207}

Whoever brings them back, may marry them all." Icmá told Timber-Hauler
to get wood and ordered Wood-Twister to twist a rope of it. Then he made
a hole in the ground and put in a box to lower himself in. He descended
to the underground country and pulled the rope to inform his friends of
his arrival. He found the three girls. The first one was guarded by a
mountain-lion, the second by a big eagle, the third by giant cannibals.
Icmá killed the lion. The girl said, "You had better turn back, the
eagle will kill you." But he slew the eagle. Then the girl said, "The
cannibals are bad men, you had better go home." "I'll wait for them."
The twelve cannibals approached yelling; they were as big as trees. The
girl said, "Run as fast as you can." But Icmá remained, and made two
slings. With the first he hurled a stone that went clean through six of
the men and killed them; and with the other sling he killed the
remaining cannibals in the same way. One of the girls gave him a
handkerchief, another one a tie, and the youngest one a ring. He took
them to his box, and pulled the rope. His two comrades hoisted up the
oldest one. Both wanted to marry her, but Icmá pulled the rope again,
and they hauled up the second girl. Then Icmá sat down in the box with
the youngest, and pulled the rope. As they were hauling them up,
Wood-Twister said, "Let us cut the rope." The other man refused, but
Wood-Twister cut the rope, and Icmá fell down. He stayed there a long
time, while his companions took the girls to the chief.

At last Icmá begged a large bird to carry him above ground. The bird
said he did not have enough to eat for such a trip. Then Icmá killed
five moose, and having packed the meat on the bird's back, mounted with
the third girl. Flying up, Icmá fed the bird with moose-meat, and when
his supply was exhausted, he cut off his own flesh and gave it to the
bird to eat. Icmá came up on the day when his false friends were going
to marry the girls. All the people were gathered there. Icmá arrived. "I
should like to go into the lodge before they get married." When he came
in, Wood-Twister was frightened. "I should like to go out, I'll be back
in a short time," he said. But he never returned. Then the chief asked,
"Which of you three rescued the girls?" Then Icmá showed the
handkerchief, the tie and the ring given him by the girls, and got all
the three girls for his wives.

## LXXX. THE ENCHANTED HORSE\[291\]

##### (MALECITE: Mechling, *Journal of American Folk-Lore*, xxvi, 247, No. 5)

There was once an old man that had a son named Louis who used to go
hunting to support his parents, for they were very poor. One day while
he was hunting, a gentleman came to visit his parents. This gentleman
offered the old man a beaver hat full of gold for his son, and promised
to take good care of the boy, whose only duties should be to tend the
gentleman's horses.

"In about twenty years you will get your son back," said he.

The old man communicated the offer of the gentleman to his wife. She,
however, was not anxious to accept it. Then the old man, goaded by the
thoughts of their poverty, tried to persuade her, and he finally
accepted the offer against his wife's inclinations. The gentleman waited
for Louis to arrive, and then he took him away.

When he arrived at his home, he showed the boy over his house, and gave
him permission to eat and drink whatever he cared to. He also showed him
two pots,--one full of gold and the other full of silver,--which he told
Louis not to touch. Later he took him to the stable where he kept the
horses, and showed him a black horse in the farthest stall, telling him
to be very particular about caring for that horse. Among other things,
he gave him orders to wash him three times, and to take him to water
three times every day. Then he pointed out to him a gray horse, and
ordered him to beat him three times a day, to give him very little to
eat, and to water him only once in twenty-four hours. Further, he told
him never to take the bridle off that gray horse. After this, he told
Louis that he was going on a journey, and would not return for a few
weeks.

Louis carried out the gentleman's instructions, and, when two weeks had
passed, the gentleman returned. The first thing he did was to go into
the stable and examine his horses. He was well pleased with the looks of
his black horse, and was also pleased to note that the gray one was
looking very poorly. While they were returning to the house together,
the gentleman began to play with Louis, who noted that he had a knife in
his hand, and was not surprised when his finger was soon cut by it. The
gentleman, however, apologized, and, taking a bottle out of his pocket,
rubbed a little of the liquid on Louis' finger.

{p. 209}

Louis was greatly surprised to find that his finger was at once entirely
healed.

Later in the day, he told Louis that he was going away again (for a
week, this time), and told him to be careful to treat the horses as he
had done before. When he had gone, Louis' curiosity got the better of
him. He took the cover off the pots, and dipped his finger into the
golden liquid. When he pulled it out, lo, and behold! his finger was
changed to gold. At once he saw that his master would know what he had
done, and, to hide his finger, he wrapped it up in a piece of rag. In
addition, Louis' pity overcame him, and he did not beat the gray horse.

At the end of the week, the gentleman returned and asked Louis how the
horses were. He was well satisfied after his inspection of the stable.
Again he began to play with Louis, his knife in his hand. While he was
playing with him, he noticed that Louis' finger was wrapped up, and he
inquired of Louis what was the matter with his finger. Louis replied
that he had cut it. The gentleman pulled the rag off, and seeing that
Louis' finger had turned to gold, he knew that Louis had been meddling
with the pots. He became very angry, and grasped Louis' finger, twisted
it, pulled it off, and threw it back into the pot, warning Louis not to
touch the pots again. He played with him as before, and again cut him on
the hand. A second time he applied the liquid, and again the boy's hand
was healed immediately.

He again told Louis that he was going away, and would be gone for three
weeks, and ordered him to beat the gray horse on this occasion five
times each day.

That day Louis watered the horses, and, noticing that the gray horse
could hardly drink any water with the bit in his mouth, he took pity on
him, removed the bridle, and gave the horse a good drink. When the horse
lifted his head from the brook and looked at Louis, he had a man's face
on him and he spoke to Louis as follows: "You have saved me. If you do
as I tell you, we both shall be saved. The master is not a man, but the
Devil. He came to my parents as he did to yours, and bought me with a
beaver hat full of money. Every time he comes and cuts you, he is trying
you to see if you are fat enough to be killed. When he returns this
time, he will again try you, and, if he finds that you are not fat
enough, he will turn you into a horse. If you are fat enough, he will
kill you. If you do

{p. 210}

as I tell you, Louis, we both shall be saved. Now feed me as well as you
can for two weeks; put my bridle on the black horse, and beat him five
times a day. In short, give him the treatment which was destined for
me."

Louis did as the Gray Horse requested, and the animal began to recover
his lost weight. The black horse lost weight rapidly. After the two
weeks were up, the gray horse was in good condition; the black horse was
very poorly.

"Now," said the Gray Horse," the Devil suspects that things have not
gone properly, and he is returning. Now we must prepare speedily to
leave. Since his black horse is very swift, you must go and cut his legs
off: cut the left foreleg off below the knee; cut the right fore-leg off
away above the knee; cut the right hind-leg off below the knee; and the
left hind-leg, away above the knee. He will not then be able to travel
so fast, for his legs will be short and of different lengths."

When Louis had completed his task, the Gray Horse told him to go to the
house and get the pots of silver and gold; and, on Louis' return with
them, the Horse told Louis to dip his tail in the silver pot, and to dip
his mane and ears in the gold one.

"And you dip your hair into the gold pot," said the Horse, "and stick
your little fingers into the metal. Take the saddle and put it on me,
but, before we start, go into the house and get three grains of black
corn which he has upon his shelf, and take his flint, steel, and punk.
Take, also, an awl, that round pebble which comes from the seashore, and
then take that wisp of hay which is pointed."

Louis did as the Horse bade him, and then mounted on his back and rode
away.

The Devil returned two days after they had started, and, when he saw
that the gray horse had gone and the black horse was mutilated, he knew
what had taken place. This enraged him very much, and he at once began
to think how he could outwit the fugitives. Finally he set out in
pursuit.

After Louis and the Gray Horse had been gone several days, the Gray
Horse spoke to the boy, and said, "The Devil and the black horse are
pretty close. You did not cut his legs short enough. Give me one of
those grains of black corn, and I'll go a little faster."

{p. 211}

Louis gave him one of the grains of black corn, and the Gray Horse
traveled much faster. After a few days had passed, the Horse again said,
"Louis, he is getting very close. You will have to give me another
grain."

So Louis gave him a second grain, and the Gray Horse increased his
speed. Three days later, the Gray Horse said to Louis, "Give me the last
grain. He is getting very close."

After three more days, the Gray Horse again spoke, and said, "Louis, he
is very close. Throw the awl behind you."\[205\]

Louis did as he was told, and the Horse said, "Now, that awl has made a
great field of thorn-bushes grow, many miles in extent."

When the Devil rode up, he was going so fast that he rode right in among
the thorns, and got his horse out only after a great deal of trouble. By
the time he had extricated his. horse and had ridden around the field,
Louis had gained a great distance over him.

"Louis, he is getting very close," said the Horse some days later.
"Throw back the flint."

Louis obeyed him, with the result that, when the Devil came up, he was
confronted by a high wall of bare rock, which extended for miles. He was
forced to go around this, and, when he once more took up the trail,
Louis had gained many more miles on him. After a couple of days, the
Gray Horse said, "Louis, we have only two things left, and I am afraid
that we are going to have a hard time."

"I think," said Louis, "we had better throw the punk behind." With that
he threw the punk behind him. When it struck the ground, it immediately
burst into flame, starting a forest fire which extended many miles.

When the Devil arrived, he was going too fast to avoid riding into the
fire, and this caused him great trouble. He had to go many miles out of
his way to avoid the fire, and this delay enabled the fugitives to make
a material gain in distance. In two or three days the Devil had regained
the distance that he had lost.

The Gray Horse now said to Louis, "I am afraid that he is going to
overtake us before we can reach the sea. He is gaining rapidly upon us,
and is now very close. You had better throw the pebble behind you; it is
the only chance left us."

{p. 212}

Louis threw the pebble behind them; and the result was that a great lake
appeared, which extended over many square miles. The Devil rode up to
the lake, and, knowing whither they had gone, he travelled around it.
This manœuvre cost the Devil the loss of many valuable miles, for Louis
and the Gray Horse were by this time quite close to the sea.

"He is still gaining on us." said the Gray Horse. "I'm getting very
tired."

Looking ahead, Louis could see the ocean, and turning around, he could
see the Devil coming, gaining on them all the time.

"Louis, I am afraid he is going to overtake us," said the Horse.

Now, Louis did not understand what advantage it would be for them to
arrive at the sea; but this was soon apparent. They did manage to reach
the seashore ahead of the Devil, however, when the Gray Horse said,
"Louis, throw out that wisp of hay."

Louis pushed it out, and, behold! as he thrust it, the wisp of hay was
converted into a bridge. They immediately rode out upon this, and as
they passed over it, the bridge folded up behind them! The Devil did not
reach the sea until they were a safe distance from the shore.

"It was very lucky," the Devil said, "that you took my bridge with you,
or I would have eaten you two for my dinner! "

Now, Louis and his horse continued to cross the bridge until they came
to the land on the other side. While travelling along through this new
country, they discovered a cave.

"Now," the Gray Horse said to Louis, "you stable me in here, and go up
to the king's house and see if you cannot get work. Wrap up your head in
order that your hair may not be seen, and do the same to your little
fingers. When you arrive there, go and lie with your face down behind
the kitchen, and wait until they throw out the dish-water. They will ask
you what you want. Tell them that you desire work, and that you are a
good gardener. Do not forget to comb your hair once a day in the garden,
where they cannot see you."

The young man did all the Gray Horse suggested, and, when one of the
maids threw out some dish-water behind the kitchen, she noticed him, and
straightway notified the king. His Majesty ordered the youth to be
brought before him, and, when

{p. 213}

Louis had come, the king inquired into his identity and his desires.
Louis told the king that he wanted work, and the king employed him as a
gardener, because Louis claimed greater ability than the other
gardeners. Every noon he would seclude himself to comb his hair, and
then he would tie up his head again in the cloth. Although he was quite
handsome, he did not look well with his head tied up in this manner. His
work, moreover, was so excellent that the king soon noticed an
improvement in the garden.

One day, while he was combing his hair, the princess looked out of her
window, and saw Louis' hair. She noticed that the hair was all of gold;
and the light from it shone into her room as it would if reflected from
a mirror. Louis did not notice her, and, when he had completed his
toilet, he wrapped up his head again and went away, leaving the princess
enchanted by his looks.

During the same afternoon, while he was working near the palace, the
princess dropped a note down to him. Louis did not see it, and therefore
did not pay any attention to it. She then dropped several more, one
after another; but he paid no attention to them.

The next day, he thought he would go down and see his horse. When he
arrived at the cave, the Gray Horse inquired what had happened. Louis
related the few events to him; but the Gray Horse told him that that was
not all, for he had not noticed the princess looking at him when he was
combing his hair.

"To-morrow," said the Horse, "the king will ask you if you are descended
of royal blood. You tell him that you are the child of poor parents.
There is a prince who wants to marry the princess; but she does not love
him. When you go back to work in the garden, the princess will drop
notes to you again, but don't touch them. Louis, in time you shall marry
her, but don't forget me."

Louis returned, and the princess again dropped him notes; but he ignored
them.

In the meantime the prince had come to see the princess, and he made
arrangements with the king to marry his daughter. The princess, however,
would not look at the prince. The king demanded of his daughter why she
did not want to see the prince, and she told him that she desired to
marry the gardener.

{p. 214}

The king became very angry; he declared that she could not marry the
poor beggar.

"Did you not always say that you would give me anything I wanted?" she
asked of the king.

"Yes," answered he; "but you must marry a prince."

She again refused to marry the prince. At this, the king became very
angry, and went out to tell his wife what the princess had said.

"I think the gardener is a prince in disguise," the queen said to the
king.

The king summoned Louis into his presence; and the young man, obeying,
came into the midst of the royalty and nobility of the palace, with his
head still covered. The king asked him if he was of royal blood.

"No," he replied. "I am the son of poor parents."

The king then dismissed him.

The princess, however, contrived a means to marry Louis, and, when the
ceremony was over, they went back to the king. She told her father what
she had done, and asked for her dowry. He told her that her dowry should
be the pig-pen in which he fattened his hogs; and he drove them from the
palace with nothing more. The queen was in tears at the way the king
treated their daughter; but he was obdurate.

The princess and Louis had to subsist on what little the queen could
send them. Soon the princess said to Louis, "We had better go to the
place where your parents live."

"No," said Louis, "we must go where the king sends us, for his will is
my pleasure."

So they went to the pig-pen and fixed up a place to sleep. Every day the
princess went to the palace, and the servants there would give her what
was left from the table. This continued for several weeks, until, one
day, Louis thought of his Horse. He went over to the cave to find out
how he was doing.

"Well, Louis, I see that you are married, and that your father-in-law is
treating you pretty badly," the Horse said to him. "Now you look in my
left ear, and you will see a cloth folded up."

Louis did as directed; and the Gray Horse continued, "Take the cloth. At
meal-time unfold it, and you will find inside all sorts of food of the
finest kind. Come back and see me tomorrow."

{p. 215}

Louis returned to his hog-pen, where his wife had the leavings from the
palace table arranged for supper.

"Take this cloth and unfold it," said he.

And when she unfolded it, she was amazed to see delicious food and fine
wines all ready to eat and drink. This was the first decent meal that
they had eaten since they were married. The next day he again went back
to see the Horse, who asked Louis if he had heard any news. Louis said
that he had not.

"Well," said the Gray Horse, "I did. Your father-in-law is going to war
to-morrow, because his daughter did not marry the prince to whom she was
betrothed. Louis, you had better go too. Send your wife up to borrow a
horse and arms, and you go with him."

On returning to his hog-pen, Louis told his wife what he had heard and
what he wished her to do. So she went up to the castle to borrow a horse
and armor. The king at first refused to give it; but the queen finally
persuaded him to loan his son-in-law a horse. Thus Louis was equipped
with a gray mare and an old sword. Louis accepted this; and the next
morning, when the king started with his followers, Louis went forth
mounted on the gray mare. He found, however, that she was too old to
carry him: so he rode her down to the cave. There the Gray Horse told
him to look in his right ear for a little box. Louis did so, and found
the article. On opening this box, he found a ring inside it. The Horse
told him that he could now get anything he wished for, and directed him
to wish for arms and armor better than the king's own. Louis did so, and
the armor immediately appeared. When Louis had donned it, the Gray Horse
told him to comb his mane and tail; and after this was done, they
started, quite resplendent. While they were passing the pig-pen, Louis'
wife, mistaking him for a foreign king, begged him not to kill her
father, and Louis promised not to hurt the old gentleman.

The fight was already raging when Louis arrived, and the enemy was
pressing the king hard; but he came at just the right time, and turned
the tide of the battle. Not recognizing him, the king thanked him (a
strange prince, as he thought) for his assistance; and the two rode back
together. On the way they began to race; for the king was proud of his
steed, and was fond of showing him off. Louis, however, far
out-distanced him, and rode on to the cave, where he unsaddled his
horse, resumed his old clothes, and tied up his head.

{p. 216}

Before he departed, the Gray Horse told him that the king would go to
war again on the morrow, and that he, Louis, should once more borrow the
horse and sword. He took the old gray mare and the sword back to the
pig-pen. His wife inquired eagerly how her father had fared. Louis
answered that the king had been successful, and told her to take the
horse and the sword back to the palace.

When she arrived, she told her father that her husband wished her to
thank him for the horse and the sword. Whereupon the king inquired if
Louis had been present at the battle, for, he said, he had not seen him.
The princess replied that he had indeed been there; and truly, if it had
not been for Louis, the king would not have won the battle. The king
replied that he was sure that Louis was not there, or else he would have
seen him; and he persisted in this view.

The princess, being unable to convince her father, returned to the
pig-pen.

When the princess had left, the queen said that Louis must have been in
the fight, for, if he had not been there, he would not have known about
it.

"Was there no stranger there?" she asked.

"Yes," returned the king. "There was a strange prince there, who helped
me."

"Well," said the queen, "that must have been your son-in-law."

Back in the pig-pen, the princess told her husband that the king was
saying that he had not been at the battle.

"If it had not been for me," Louis replied, "the king would not have won
the battle." And so the matter was dropped.

The next morning he sent his wife up to borrow the horse and equipment
again. The king gave his daughter the same outfit. Again Louis went to
the cave, where he again changed horses and armor. Once more, when he
passed his hovel, his wife did not recognize him. When Louis arrived,
the battle was going against the king, as on the former occasion; but
the young man a second time turned the tide in favor of his
father-in-law.

After the battle was over, Louis and the king rode back together. The
king wished to find out who this prince might be, and he determined to
put a mark on him, so that he would recognize him again. He took out his
sword to show how he had overcome one of his adversaries in battle, and
stabbed his

{p. 217}

son-in-law in the leg. A piece of the king's sword had broken off, and
was left in the wound. The king pretended to be very sorry, and tied up
the wound. When they started off again, Louis put spurs to his horse,
and when he reached the cave he again changed horses. Then he returned
to the pig-pen with the old gray mare.

He was cut so badly, that he could walk only with difficulty. When his
wife inquired if he had been wounded, be explained how her father had
done it. Thereupon his wife took the handkerchief off, took out the
piece of sword, and rebound the wound. Then she took the horse and
sword, together with the broken piece of the king's sword and his
handkerchief, to her father.

She told her father that her husband sent back the handkerchief and the
piece of sword, and also his thanks for stabbing him after he had won
the battle. The king was so much surprised that he almost fainted. The
queen began to scold the king, saying, "Did I not tell you that he was a
prince?"

The king sent his daughter to the pig-pen to get her husband, so that he
could ask his forgiveness. Louis refused to go, saying that the king's
word was law, and was not to be altered. He was confined to his bed on
account of the wound which he had received. The princess returned, and
told her father what her husband had said. He then sent down his chief
men to coax Louis, but they were refused every time. Finally, the king
and the queen themselves went down and asked Louis' forgiveness; but
Louis repeated his refusal. The king rushed up, but he was mired in the
mud which surrounded the pig-pen. The queen, however, was able to cross
on top of the mud, leaving the king, who returned alone to his palace.

The same night, Louis took his ring and wished that he and his wife
should wake in the morning in a beautiful castle and when the day came,
lo, and behold! it was as he desired. In surprise, the king saw the
castle, and sent Louis a note, saying that he desired to wage war with
him. The young man sent a reply, that, by the time he fired his second
shot, there would not be even a cat left in the king's city. This note
he sent by his wife, and requested her to bring her mother back with
her.

The king's daughter obeyed, and brought her mother back.

That afternoon, the king fired on his son-in-law's castle, but did no
damage. Louis then warned the king that he was going

{p. 218}

to begin his cannonade, and straightway fired. His first shot carried
away half of the city, and the second swept away all that was left of
it.

## LXXXI. LITTLE POUCET\[291\]

##### (THOMPSON: Teit, *Journal of American Folk-Lore*, xxix, 318, No. II)

Jack and his elder brother lived with their parents, who had a cook.
They were enormous eaters; and when food was put on the table, they
rapidly ate it all up, so that their parents had not enough. As they
grew, they ate more; and at meal-time, even when the table was loaded
with food, their parents had eaten only a few mouthfuls before all the
food was finished.

Their parents made up their minds to get rid of them. They told the cook
to provide them with a large lunch each, take them to a rough part of
the mountains, and leave them. Jack read his parents' minds, and told
his elder brother what was proposed. That day he went to a wise and
friendly old woman who lived near by, and asked her for advice. She gave
him a large reel of thread and told him what to do. Next morning the
cook provided them with packs of food, and told them he would take them
to hunt grouse. They followed him; and as they went, Jack unrolled the
thread unobserved by the cook. When the thread was almost all unrolled,
the cook halted in a wild spot, saying, "We will camp here for to-night.
I am going over yonder to shoot some grouse, and will be back before
dusk."

As soon as he was out of sight, the lads followed the thread back to
their home, and arrived there shortly after the cook, and just as their
parents were going to eat. Having left their lunch in the mountains,
they were very hungry, and ate up the supper almost before their parents
had commenced.

Their parents told the cook to take them farther away next time. Jack
knew what they had arranged, and went to see the old woman again. She
gave him a sack full of fine powder, which shone both by day and by
night, but was brightest at night, and she told him what to do. On the
following morning the cook said he would take them hunting. As they
followed the cook, Jack sprinkled the phosphorescent dust along the way.
When the sack was about empty, the cook said, "We will camp here. I will
go to yonder brush and shoot rabbits. Stay here until I return." As soon
as he was out of sight, the boys

{p. 219}

ran back along the sprinkled trail. When they were about halfway back in
a rough piece of country, they ran into a very large flock of small
birds, and chased them hither and thither, trying to catch them.

In this way they lost their trail. They searched for a long time, but
could not find it. They wandered on, not knowing where they were going.
They descended from the mountains, and came to a plain where they saw a
butte with a very tall pine-tree growing on top. They went there. The
elder brother tried to climb the tree, but he became dizzy and descended
again. Then Jack went up, reached the top, and looked around. Far away
he saw a column of smoke, and called to his brother to turn his face the
way he pointed. Jack descended, and they travelled the way his brother
was facing. At night they camped, and sat facing the same way, so that
they might not go astray.

The next day they reached a large underground lodge. They were almost
famished. Their shoes and clothes were in tatters. They found an old
woman within, who fed them and then hid them in the cellar within the
house. She told them that her husband was a cannibal. The cannibal and
his wife had two children of the same size as Jack and his brother.
Being young cannibals, they sniffed around Jack and his brother, and,
when they were in the cellar, continued to sniff about, so that their
mother had to drive them away. Towards evening the cannibal approached
the house, saying, "Nôm, nôm, nôm, where can I get some meat?" On
entering, he told his wife that he smelled game within the house; and
she, on being threatened with a thrashing, disclosed the fact that the
boys were hidden in the cellar. Jack told his brother that he would
influence the cannibal's mind, so that they might be spared.

The cannibal pulled them out of the cellar, and was about to eat them.
Then he hesitated, and began to look them over. He said, "They are too
thin." He put them back into the cellar, and told his wife to feed them
well and give them a good place to sleep, that they might get fat and
tender quickly. The next day the woman made a bed for them. After they
had been in the house for some time, the cannibal told his wife the boys
were now fit to eat, and he would kill them in the morning.

Jack knew his intention. He made the cannibal and his family sleep very
soundly that night. The lads arose, and placed the cannibal's children
in the bed in which they themselves had

{p. 220}

been, and put logs of rotten wood in the bed of the cannibal's children.
They took the cannibal's magic staff of gold, four stones which, as he
learned afterwards, were gold nuggets, and the key of his door. When any
one attempted to open the house-door except with the proper key, a bell
would ring.

In the morning, when the cannibal awoke, he immediately went to the bed
in which the boys used to sleep, and killed his own children, whom he
mistook for the captive boys. When about to eat them, he noticed their
fingers, and thus realized that he had killed his own children. He
uncovered what seemed to be children in the other bed, and found the
logs of rotten wood.

The cannibal gave chase to Jack and his brother, who by this time were
far away. When the lads saw that they would be overtaken, they hid
themselves in the roots of a patch of tall grass. The cannibal, who had
lost track of the boys, returned in another direction. As soon as he was
out of sight, the lads ran on. Then the cannibal found their tracks
again. The boys had just reached a broad lake, when he hove in sight.
Jack threw his staff down on the water, and they crossed it as on a
bridge. When they reached the opposite shore, he lifted it up, and the
cannibal could not cross. He shouted, "I will forgive you, I will not
harm you, if you will only give me back my staff!" but Jack stuck the
staff in the ground at the edge of the lake, and left the cannibal
crying.

Not far from here they came to a large town of whites, where there was a
chief and many soldiers, also many houses, stores, and farms. The
cannibal used to prey on these people, who were much afraid of him. Here
Jack and his brother separated, each getting work on a different farm.

Jack's brother became jealous of him, and sought to accomplish his death
by putting him in danger. He told his master that Jack intended to steal
the large bell belonging to the cannibal. Jack's master heard of this,
and asked him if it were true, adding that his elder brother had said
so. Jack said, "Very well. I will go and get the bell. You will all see
it." The cannibal kept the bell on a wheeled vehicle alongside his
house. It was very large. Jack went at night, and, crossing the lake by
means of the staff, he soon reached the cannibal's house. He caused a
deep sleep to fall on the cannibal, his wife, and the bell. This bell
could hear a long way off, and warned

{p. 221}

the cannibal of danger by ringing. Jack ran off with the bell, hauling
it in a wagon. Just as he had reached the opposite side of the lake, the
cannibal arrived at the shore. Jack drew in the staff, and stuck it in
the ground. The cannibal begged for the staff, saying, "You may keep the
bell, but give me back my staff, with which I cross water." Jack left
him crying, and proceeded, to town, where he displayed the bell to all
the people.

After this, Jack's brother circulated the story that Jack intended to
steal the cannibal's light. His master asked him about it, and he said
he would do it. He took with him three small sacks of salt. When he came
to the cannibal's house, he looked down the smoke-hole. He saw the
cannibal busy boiling a large kettle full of human flesh, which was now
almost ready to be eaten. Jack emptied one sack full of salt into the
kettle. The cannibal had a large spoon with which he was tasting the
broth. When he took the next spoonful, he found the taste so agreeable
that he forgot to eat any of the meat, and drank only of the soup. He
said, "This must be delicious game I am boiling, to make the broth so
nice." Jack wanted to make him go to drink, so that he could steal the
light. He threw in the other sack of salt. The cannibal went to the
creek to drink, but, instead of leaving the light, took it with him
attached to his forehead. Jack ran down to the trail and hid. When the
cannibal was returning, he suddenly jumped up, and threw the salt in the
cannibal's face and on the light, so that neither of them could see. The
cannibal was so much startled that he ran away, and in his hurry and
blindness struck his toe on a tuft of grass and fell down heavily. The
light rolled off his head. Jack seized it and ran off. This light could
see a long way off, and told the cannibal what it saw. It saw farthest
at night. The cannibal could not follow Jack, because it was very dark
and he had no proper light. Jack carried the light to town, and
displayed it to the people.

Next Jack's brother told that Jack was going to bring in the cannibal
himself. His master asked him regarding it, and he said he would do it.
He went to the blacksmith and had a large trunk made of iron, with a lid
which shut with a spring. When it was finished, Jack went into it and
tried it with all his strength. He found the box was too weak. Therefore
he ordered the blacksmith to re-enforce it with heavy iron bands. He
placed the trunk on a wagon, to which he harnessed a fine

{p. 222}

team, and drove to the cannibal's house, crossing the lake on the magic
staff. The cannibal came out and admired the team, wagon, and trunk. He
did not recognize Jack, and thought he would kill the visitor and take
his wagon, trunk, and team. The cannibal admired the trunk, which was
polished and looked like steel. Jack opened the lid to show him the
inside, which was decorated with carvings, pictures in colors, and
looking-glasses. Jack proposed to sell the trunk to the cannibal, and
asked him to go in and try it. The cannibal told Jack to go in first.
Jack went in, lay down at full length, and claimed that it was very
comfortable. The cannibal then went in and Jack shut the lid on him.

The cannibal struggled to free himself, and at times nearly capsized the
trunk; but Jack drove him into town, where he stopped in the square. The
chief and soldiers and all the people flocked to see the cannibal who
had been killing them. They lifted him off the wagon, and asked Jack to
liberate him. Jack said if he liberated him, he would kill all the
people, and proposed to them to light a fire, and to roast him to death
in the trunk. Jack's brother asked him to open the trunk, but he would
not consent. Jack's brother said, "There is no danger. See these
hundreds of armed soldiers." Jack said, "It matters not, for neither
arrows, nor bullets, nor knives, can penetrate him. He will kill
everybody." His brother laughed. Jack said, "I will give you the key of
the trunk, and you may open it in four hours from now." The whites
wanted to have some fun with their enemy. When Jack had been gone four
hours, and while he was sitting on the top of a distant hill overlooking
the town, his brother opened the trunk. The cannibal, who was in a
violent rage, killed every one of the people, including Jack's brother.
There were none left. After this Jack travelled. Some say he turned
foolish, and became Jack the Trickster.

## LXXXII. THE WHITE CAT\[293\]

##### (CHILCOTIN: Farrand, *Jesup North Pacific Expedition*, ii, 26, No. II)

Thunder was a great chief who lived in the sky, and he had three
daughters, whom all the young men from the earth wished to marry' but
could not get; for whenever a suitor came to ask Thunder for one of his
daughters, Thunder would kill him.

{p. 223}

He would tell the young man to go into the house to get food, and would
open the door for him, and the young man would go inside; but the house
was really a bear's den, and the bears would kill him. Finally there
came a young man to try for one of the daughters; and as he came near
the house, he saw a small lake in which the three women were bathing.
The man hid himself, and stole over to where the women's clothes were
lying, and sat down upon them; and the women were ashamed and would not
come out. So they sat down in the water and began to parley. The oldest
woman said he could have the youngest sister if he would give back the
clothes; but the young man declined. Then she said he could have both
her sisters; but the young man said he wanted her herself. So at last
the woman said, "Well, I am a poor woman, but if you will give back our
clothes, you may have me."

The young man agreed, and turned his back while they dressed. Then they
started together for their father's house; and on the way the women told
him of how Thunder killed men, and what he had to do to escape. When
they came to the house, Thunder told the young man to go into the house
and get some food. He went in just like the other suitors; but there was
a door on the other side of the room, and he ran quickly across, and got
out before the bears could catch him. His wife was waiting for him, and
together they went to her house and spent the night. Early in the
morning he rose and went to Thunder's house, and Thunder said to him,
"My house is too old. If you will make me a new one, you can have my
daughter." The young man sat down and covered his head and thought hard.
Pretty soon he uncovered his head, and there was a fine house all built.
But Thunder refused to give him the girl. Then Thunder said to him, "My
garden is in very bad condition; it is full of stones and weeds. If you
will clear it out, you can have my daughter." So the young man sat down
and covered his head and thought, and in a little while he uncovered,
and there was the garden all cleared. Still Thunder refused to give him
his daughter.

Every night the young man went to the woman's house and slept with her,
and she told him all the ways in which her father killed men, but all
the time she feared that her husband would get caught. At last she
proposed that they should run away together to his home. So they took
all their clothes and goods

{p. 224}

and filled several houses; but the young man turned them all into a
small roll and put it in his blanket, and they started for home. Next
day Thunder discovered that the young man had stolen his daughter, and
started in pursuit; and they heard him coming a long way off and were
frightened.

They came to a great lake, and turned themselves into ducks and swam
across. And when Thunder came to the lake, he saw nothing but two ducks,
and went back home, while the young man and his wife turned back to
their proper shapes on the other, side and started on. Thunder came home
and told his wife what had happened, and she laughed at him and told him
that the ducks were the man and the woman. Then Thunder was angry, and
started in pursuit again. Again the fugitives heard Thunder coming. The
young man looked all about for a way of escape, and, seeing an owl, both
he and the woman hid themselves under the owl's wing. When Thunder came
up, he saw no traces of them. Then, seeing the owl, he caught it and
felt it all over, and picked over all the feathers; but he forgot to
look under the wing, and so failed to find them, and went back home,
while the young man and his wife started on again.

Finally they came near home. When they were only a little way off, the
woman said, "I will wait here while you go on and tell them we are
coming." As soon as the young man had gone, the woman made four houses,
and, pulling the roll from her blanket, she filled them all with clothes
and goods. And one of the houses she made ready for the young man's
mother. Not long after that, they heard Thunder hunting for them again;
and when he came up, he was very angry, and wanted to kill all the
people in the village. But his daughter made a great crack in the
ground, and Thunder fell in up to his waist, and stuck fast. Then his
daughter built a tent over his head, and used to feed him through a hole
in the tent. There he staid for two years. But at last he grew tired,
and told his daughter if she would let him out he would go home and not
trouble them any more. So she freed him, and he went away; and after
that the young man and his wife lived in peace.

{p. 225}

## LXXXIII. CINDERELLA\[294\]

##### (Zuñi: Cushing, *Zuni Folk Tales*, p. 54\[\*\])

Long, long ago, our ancients had neither sheep nor horses nor cattle;
yet they had domestic animals of various kinds--amongst them Turkeys.

In Mátsaki, or the Salt City, there dwelt at this time many very wealthy
families, who possessed large flocks of these birds, which it was their
custom to have their slaves or the poor people of the town herd in the
plains round about Thunder Mountain, below which their town stood, and
on the mesas beyond.

Now, in Mátsaki at this time there stood, away out near the border of
the town, a little tumbledown, single-room house, wherein there lived
alone a very poor girl,--so poor that her clothes were patched and
tattered and dirty, and her person, on account of long neglect and ill
fare, shameful to look upon, though she herself was not ugly, but had a
winning face and bright eyes; that is, if the face had been more oval
and the eyes less oppressed with care. So poor was she that she herded
Turkeys for a living; and little was given to her except the food she
subsisted on from day to day, and perhaps now and then a piece of old,
worn-out clothing.

Like the extremely poor everywhere and at all times, she was humble, and
by her longing for kindness, which she never received, she was made kind
even to the creatures that depended upon her, and lavished this kindness
upon the Turkeys she drove to and from the plains every day. Thus, the
Turkeys, appreciating this, were very obedient. They loved their
mistress so much that at her call they would unhesitatingly come, or at
her behest go whithersoever and whensoever she wished.

One day, this poor girl driving her Turkeys down into the plains, passed
near Old Zuñi,--the Middle Ant Hill of the World, as our ancients have
taught us to call our home,--and as she went along, she heard the
herald-priest proclaiming from the house-top that the Dance of the
Sacred Bird (which is a very blessed and welcome festival to our people,
especially to the youths and maidens who are permitted to join in the
dance) would take place in four days.

\[\*. Reprinted by special arrangement with G. P. Putnam's Sons, the
publishers.\]

{p. 226}

Now, this poor girt had never been permitted to join in or even to watch
the great festivities of our people or the people in the neighboring
towns, and naturally she longed very much to see this dance. But she put
aside her longing, because she reflected: "It is impossible that I
should watch, much less join in the Dance of the Sacred Bird, ugly and
ill-clad as I am." And thus musing to herself, and talking to her
Turkeys, as was her custom, she drove them on, and at night returned
them to their cages round the edges and in the plazas of the town.

Every day after that, until the day named for the dance, this poor girl,
as she drove her Turkeys out in the morning, saw the people busy in
cleaning and preparing their garments, cooking delicacies, and otherwise
making ready for the festival to which they had been duly invited by the
other villagers, and heard them talking and laughing merrily at the
prospect of the coming holiday. So, as she went about with her Turkeys
through the day, she would talk to them, though she never dreamed that
they understood a word of what she was saying.

It seems that they did understand even more than she said to them, for
on the fourth day, after the people of Mátsaki had all departed toward
Zuñi and the girl was wandering around the plains alone with her
Turkeys, one of the big Gobblers strutted up to her, and making a fan of
his tail, and skirts, as it were, of his wings, blushed with pride and
puffed with importance, stretched out his neck and said: "Maiden mother,
we know what your thoughts are, and truly we pity you, and wish that,
like the other people of Mátsaki, you might enjoy this holiday in the
town below. We have said to ourselves at night, after you have placed us
safely and comfortably in our cages: 'Truly our maiden mother is as
worthy to enjoy these things as any one in Mátsaki, or even Zuñi.' Now,
listen well, for I speak the speech of all the elders of my people: If
you will drive us in early this afternoon, when the dance is most gay
and the people are most happy, we will help you to make yourself so
handsome and so prettily dressed that never a man, woman, or child
amongst all those who are assembled at the dance will know you; but
rather, especially the young men, will wonder whence you came, and long
to lay hold of your hand in the circle that forms round the altar to
dance. Maiden mother, would you like to go to see this dance, and even
to join in it, and be merry with the best of your people?"

{p. 227}

The poor girl was at first surprised. Then it seemed all so natural that
the Turkeys should talk to her as she did to them, that she sat down on
a little mound, and, leaning over, looked at them and said: "My beloved
Turkeys, how glad I am that we may speak together! But why should you
tell me of things that you full well know 1 so long to, but cannot by
any possible means, do?"

"Trust in us," said the old Gobbler, "for I speak the speech of my
people, and when we begin to call and call and gobble and gobble, and
turn toward our home in Mátsaki, do you follow us, and we will show you
what we can do for you. Only let me tell you one thing: No one knows how
much happiness and good fortune may come to you if you but enjoy
temperately the pleasures we enable you to participate in. But if, in
the excess of your enjoyment, you should forget us, who are your
friends, yet so much depend upon you, then we will think: 'Behold, this
our maiden mother, though so humble and poor, deserves, forsooth, her
hard life, because, were she more prosperous, she would be unto others
as others now are unto her.'"

"Never fear, O my Turkeys,--cried the maiden,--only half trusting that
they could do so much for her, yet longing to try,--"never fear. In
everything you direct me to do I will be obedient as you always have
been to me."

The sun had scarce begun to decline, when the Turkeys of their own
accord turned homeward, and the maiden followed them, light of heart.
They knew their places well, and immediately ran to them. When all had
entered, even their barelegged children, the old Gobbler called to the
maiden, saying: "Enter our house." She therefore went in. "Now, maiden,
sit down," said he, "and give to me and my companions, one by one, your
articles of clothing. We will see if we cannot renew them."

The maiden obediently drew off the ragged old mantle that covered her
shoulders and cast it on the ground before the speaker. He seized it in
his beak, and spread it out, and picked and picked at it; then he trod
upon it, and lowering his wings, began to strut back and forth over it.
Then taking it up in his beak, and continuing to strut, he puffed and
puffed, and laid it down at the feet of the maiden, a beautiful white
embroidered cotton mantle. Then another Gobbler came forth, and she gave
him another article of dress, and then another and another,

{p. 228}

until each garment the maiden had worn was new and as beautiful as any
possessed by her mistresses in Mátsaki.

Before the maiden donned all these garments, the Turkeys circled about
her, singing and singing, and clucking and clucking, and brushing her
with their wings, until her person was as clean and her skin as smooth
and bright as that of the fairest maiden of the wealthiest home in
Mátsaki. Her hair was soft and wavy, instead of being an ugly, sun-burnt
shock; her cheeks were full and dimpled, and her eyes dancing with
smiles,--for she now saw how true had been the words of the Turkeys.

Finally, one old Turkey came, forward and said: "Only the rich ornaments
worn by those who have many possessions are lacking to thee, O maiden
mother. Wait a moment. We have keen eyes, and have gathered many
valuable things,--as such things, being small, though precious, are apt
to be lost from time to time by men and maidens."

Spreading his wings, he trod round and round upon the ground, throwing
his head back, and laying his wattled beard on his neck; and, presently
beginning to cough, he produced in his beak a beautiful necklace;
another Turkey brought forth earrings, and so on, until all the proper
ornaments appeared, befitting a well-clad maiden of the olden days, and
were laid at the feet of the poor Turkey girl.

With these beautiful things she decorated herself, and, thanking the
Turkeys over and over, she started to go, and they called out: "O maiden
mother, leave open the wicket, for who knows whether you will remember
your Turkeys or not when your fortunes are changed, and if you will not
grow ashamed that you have been the maiden mother of Turkeys? But we
love you, and would bring you to good fortune. Therefore, remember our
words of advice, and do not tarry too long."

"I will surely remember, O my Turkeys!" answered the maiden.

Hastily she sped away down the river path toward Zuñi. When she arrived
there, she went in at the western side of the town and through one of
the long covered ways that lead into the dance court. When she came just
inside of the court, behold, every one began to look at her, and many
murmurs ran through the crowd,--murmurs of astonishment at her beauty
and the richness of her dress,--and the people were all asking one
another, "Whence comes this beautiful maiden?"

{p. 229}

Not long did she stand there neglected. The chiefs of the dance, all
gorgeous in their holiday attire, hastily came to her, and, with
apologies for the incompleteness of their arrangements,--though these
arrangements were as complete as they possibly could be,--invited her to
join the youths and maidens dancing round the musicians and the altar in
the center of the plaza.

With a blush and a smile and a toss of her hair over her eyes, the
maiden stepped into the circle, and the finest youths among the dancers
vied with one another for her hand. Her heart became light and her feet
merry, and the music sped her breath to rapid coming and going, and the
warmth swept over her face, and she danced and danced until the sun sank
low in the west.

But, alas! in the excess of her enjoyment, she thought not of her
Turkeys, or, if she thought of them, she said to herself, "How is this,
that I should go away from the most precious consideration to my flock
of gobbling Turkeys? I will stay a while longer, and just before the sun
sets I will run back to them, that these people may not see who I am,
and that I may have the joy of hearing them talk day after day and
wonder who the girl was who joined in their dance."

So the time sped on, and another dance was called, and another, and
never a moment did the people let her rest; but they would have her in
every dance as they moved around the musicians and the altar in the
center of the plaza.

At last the sun set, and the dance was well-nigh over, when suddenly
breaking away, the girl ran out, and, being swift of foot,--more so than
most of the people of her village,--she sped up the river path before
any one could follow the course she had taken.

Meantime, as it grew late, the Turkeys began to wonder and wonder that
their maiden mother did not return to them. At last a gray old Gobbler
mournfully exclaimed, "It is as we might have expected. She has
forgotten us; therefore is she not worthy of better things than those
she has been accustomed to. Let us go forth to the mountains and endure
no more of this irksome captivity, inasmuch as we may no longer think
our maiden mother as good and true as once we thought her."

So, calling and calling to one another in loud voices, they trooped out
of their cage and ran up toward the Cañon of the Cottonwoods, and then
round behind Thunder Mountain, through the Gateway of Zuñi, and so on up
the valley.

{p. 230}

All breathless, the maiden arrived at the open wicket and looked in.
Behold, not a Turkey was there! Trailing them, she ran and she ran up
the valley to overtake them; but they were far ahead, and it was only
after a long time that she came within the sound of their voices, and
then, redoubling her speed, well-nigh overtook them, when she heard them
singing this song:

K'yaanaa, to! to!  
K'yaanaa, to! to!  
    Ye ye!  
K'yaanaa, to! to!  
K'yaanaa, to! to!  
    Yee huli huli!

Hon awen Tsita  
Itiwanakwïn  
    Otakyaan aaa kyaa;  
Lesna Akyaaa  
Shoya-k'oskwi  
Teyäthltokwïn  
    Hon aawani!

Ye yee huli huli,  
Tot-tot, tot-tot, tot-tot,  
    Huli huli!\[\*\]

Up the river, to! to!  
Up the river, to! to!  
    Sing ye ye!  
Up the river, to! to!  
Up the river, to! to!  
    Sing ye huli huli!

Oh, our maiden mother  
To the middle place  
    To dance went away;  
Therefore as she lingers,  
To the Cañon Mesa  
And the plains above it  
    We all run away!

Sing ye ye huli huli,  
Tot-tot, tot-tot, tot-tot,  
    Huli huli!  
Tot-tot, tot-tot, tot-tot,  
    Huli huli!

\[\*. This, like all the folk-songs, is difficult of translation; and
that which is given is only approximate. \[Cushing's note.\]\]

{p. 231}

Hearing this, the maiden called to her Turkeys; called and called in
vain. They only quickened their steps, spreading their wings to help
them along, singing the song over and over until, indeed, they came to
the base of the Cañon Mesa, at the borders of the Zuñi Mountains. Then
singing once more their song in full chorus, they spread wide their
wings, and thlakwa-a-a, thlakwa-a-a, they fluttered away over the plains
above.

The poor Turkey girl threw her hands up and looked down at her dress.
With dust and sweat, behold! it was changed to what it had been, and she
was the same poor Turkey girl that she was before. Weary, grieving, and
despairing, she returned to Mátsaki.

Thus it was in the days of the ancients. Therefore, where you see the
rocks leading up to the top of Cañon Mesa, there are the tracks of
turkeys and other figures to be seen. The latter are the song that the
Turkeys sang, graven in the rocks; and all over the plains along the
borders of Zuñi Mountains since that day turkeys have been more abundant
than in any other place.

After all, the gods dispose of men according as men are fitted; and if
the poor be poor in heart and spirit as well as in appearance, how will
they be aught but poor to the end of their days?

Thus shortens my story.

## LXXXIV. THE TRUE BRIDE\[295\]

##### (THOMPSON: Teit, *Journal of American Folk-Lore*, xxix, 301, No. 1)

There was a white man who had a wife and daughter. The wife died, and he
married another woman, who also bore him a daughter. The step-mother was
always angry with her stepdaughter, and accused her of being lazy. One
day in the wintertime, when there was much snow on the ground, she told
her to go and pick berries. The girl knew that no berries could be found
at that season; but she was so hurt by the nagging of her step-mother,
that she said she would go. She put some food in her basket and wandered
off, saying to herself, "I will continue wandering around until I die."

After a time she saw the smoke of a lodge, which she approached and
entered. Four young men lived there, who were

{p. 232}

her relatives, but she did not know it. They gave her food to eat, and
asked her why she travelled in the snow. She answered that she had a bad
step-mother, who always scolded her, and had sent her out to pick
berries in the snow. They gave her a snow-shovel, or scraper of some
kind, and told her to go up on the roof of the house and dig away the
snow. When she had removed the snow from the roof of the house, she saw
that it was covered with earth, in which grew many strawberries of large
size. The men passed up her basket, and she soon filled it with the
finest strawberries.

When she had come down and was about to leave, the men said, "What shall
we do for our sister?" She answered, "If by any means you can help me, I
shall be glad. I am very poor, and have only rags to wear." Now, the
youngest brother told her to spit; and when she spat, the spittle became
a nugget of gold. The next brother made shoes for her of very fine
material, which fitted her perfectly, and would never wear out. The
third brother made a dress for her in the same way. The eldest brother
said, "I will make a robe for her which will always look well and new,
and will never wear out." As the brothers in succession made their
awards, each article in turn appeared on her person, while her old
clothes disappeared. She returned home with the basketful of
strawberries, and delivered them to her step-mother, who was much
surprised. She noticed that the clothes of the girl were all changed and
of very fine material, and that she had the power of spitting gold,
which she would gather up and put in a sack. This made her angry.

She said to her own daughter, "You see what your elder sister has
brought us. She managed to find some berries. Go and get some too." She
told her secretly to follow the tracks of her sister. She would then be
sure of reaching the same place, and learn how she had obtained the
strawberries, the fine clothes, and the power of spitting gold. The girl
took her basket and departed. When she arrived at the house of the four
brothers, they gave her food to eat, and asked her why she was
travelling at that time of year. She answered, "My mother ordered me to
go and gather strawberries, although it is winter-time and no berries
are to be found. However, my sister found some, and my mother said I
could get some at the same place."

The men directed her as they had her sister; and after removing the snow
from the roof, she found strawberries growing

{p. 233}

profusely underneath. When she had filled her basket and was about to
return, the brothers said, "What shall we do for our sister?" The
youngest man asked her to spit, but she felt insulted at the request.
She was vain and haughty. She thought they were fooling her. They
intended to help her, but became disgusted on account of her vanity, and
decided to give her nothing good. At last she spat, and the spittle
turned into a toe-nail and smelled like toe-nails. The other brothers
refused to help her in any way. She returned with the strawberries, and
gave them to her mother. The latter noticed that she had no new clothes,
and felt disappointed. She asked her to spit, but instead of gold she
spat a bad-smelling toe-nail. She told her not to spit again.

One day the chief's son was passing, and saw the elder girl busy washing
clothes. He liked her looks and her dress. His father, whom he told of
his admiration for the girl, encouraged him to visit her and make her
acquaintance. He said, "You may change your mind when you see her
again." The young man visited the girl and held some conversation with
her, during which she coughed and spat on the ground several times. He
returned and told his father that the girl he fancied could spit gold
nuggets. His father would not believe it, and went to see for himself.
During his conversation with her, she spat repeatedly, and picked up the
gold nuggets and put them in a sack she carried. He asked her to spit
again. He picked up the spittle and satisfied himself that it was really
gold. Then he advised his son to marry her, saying, " She is a valuable
woman, she is worth many."

Now, it was reported that the chief's son was to marry the girl who
could spit gold. All the white people came to the great wedding. At the
end of the wedding feast the bride spat out much gold, so the wedding
guests carried away some to their homes. Thus the bride provided them
all with presents, and became renowned, and well liked by all.

In due time She-who-spat-Gold became pregnant. When she was about to be
delivered, her husband was called away to an important meeting in a
distant place, from which he could not return for a month. The
chieftainess asked her husband to request his mother to attend her when
her time came, as she had no faith in her step-mother, who might use the
opportunity to do her harm. Her husband, however, assuaged her
misgivings,

{p. 234}

and insisted that her step-mother, who was an expert midwife, and her
half-sister, should assist her.

When she was about to give birth, her step-mother made a hole in the
floor, placed the young woman over it, and, when the child was born, she
cut the navel-string and let the infant fall through the hole. Then she
put a cat in its place; and when the mother sat up and asked for her
child the step-mother put the cat in her arms. The woman said, "It is
strange that I should give birth to a cat!" The step-mother said, "Odd
people have odd children." The young woman reared the cat as if it were
her own child.

Her husband was disappointed when he returned but said nothing. Again
the woman became pregnant, and again her husband was called away about
the time of her delivery. She was again attended by her step-mother, who
dropped the child through a hole in the floor. This time she gave the
woman a snake, telling her that she had given birth to it. She added,
"How strange are the children to which you give birth!" On the return of
the husband, the step-mother told him that he ought to kill his wife,
because she was giving birth to cats and snakes. She told him that he
ought to marry her own daughter, who was a good woman, and would give
birth to proper children. The chief and all the people held a meeting,
and decided that his wife should be killed. They bound her with iron,
took her in a canoe to the middle of the lake, and cast her overboard.

Now, the four brothers knew what was happening, and were there under the
water to intercept her, and prevent her from drowning. They untied her,
and after telling her that her real children were alive, and that things
would come well in the end, they transformed her into a goose, and she
swam about on the lake. The chief's son did not like his new wife,
because she was disgusting and smelled nasty.

Now, She-who-spat-Gold had a favorite dog called "Spióola," which she
had not seen since the time of the birth of her first child. He lived or
slept underneath the house; and when the step-mother dropped the baby
through the hole, he had taken charge of it. He licked off the blood,
got some white cloth to make a bed for it and to cover it. He had gone
to town and got milk to feed it. Later he gathered other kinds of food
and fed it, thus rearing the boy successfully. He had done the same

{p. 235}

with the younger boy. When the boys were large enough to run about, they
came out of their house, and often played near the lake, watching the
goose, which frequently approached them, crying. Spióola had to go on
trips to gather food, and always warned them not to go too far away
during his absence, or let any one see them.

One day, however, the old step-mother noticed them, and tried to capture
them; but they disappeared in a small hole under the house, and blocked
it with a stone from the inside. She made up her mind to poison them.
She scattered some fine food, which the children ate and then died. When
Spióola came home, he missed the boys. After a while he took their
scent, found them, and carried their bodies into his house.

As he could not resuscitate them, he started off to the Sun to seek
help. He ran continually day and night, for Sun lived a long way off. On
the way he passed an old horse, who asked him where he was going. He
answered, "To the Sun," but did not stop or look around. The horse
shouted, "Ask the Sun why I am growing old!"

At another place he passed an apple-tree, which in like manner addressed
him, and called on him to ask Sun what made it dry up and its wood turn
dead.

Again he passed a spring of water, which also called on him to ask the
Sun why it was drying up. After running many days and nights, he came to
the edge of the earth. There he saw a stretch of water, and on the other
side the house of the Sun. He jumped into the water and swam across. He
was almost exhausted before he reached the opposite shore, and his body
was reduced to almost nothing but bones, owing to his arduous journey.

When he arrived at the Sun's house, an old woman, the mother of the Sun,
met him, and asked him why he had come there. She said, "No one comes to
see us unless he is in great trouble and requires help and wisdom."
Spióola told her that his two foster-children were dead, and he had come
to ask help, so that they might be restored. He told her all that had
happened. She fed him, and he immediately began to gain strength on the
good food used by the Sun people.

The old woman advised him what to do. He must watch the Sun when he
spat. He would spit twice,--the first time for the elder boy, and the
second time for the younger one. Spióola

{p. 236}

must carefully gather up the spittle, and keep the one apart from the
other. The questions he wished to ask in behalf of the people he had
passed on the road, she would ask the Sun herself, and Spióola would
hear the answers.

The Sun spoke of the dead children, and spat twice on the ground.
Spióola gathered up the spittle carefully, and wrapped each separately
in thin bark. Sun said the children would become quite well if treated
within four days; but after that it would be too late, for their bodies
would begin to decompose.

Now, the old woman asked Sun the questions. She said, "A horse wants to
know why he is growing old." Sun answered, "Because he is lazy. He feeds
too much in one place. He is too lazy to search for good nutritious
grass, and he is too lazy to go to water regularly. He will stand for
days in one place rather than go any distance to get water." She said,
"The apple-tree wants to know why it is drying up." Sun answered,
"Because it is too lazy, and because it has a nail in its trunk. If it
removes the nail, and loosens the ground around its roots and spreads
them out to gather moisture, and prunes off the dead and useless wood,
then it will retain its youth; but it is too lazy to do this." She said,
"The little spring wants to know why it is drying up." Sun answered,
"Because it is too lazy. If it removes all the dead twigs and leaves
which choke it up, if it makes a clean channel for itself to run in, and
drains the neighboring moist places into itself, it will always run and
be healthy."

Spióola was in despair when he learned that he had to be back in four
days to save the lives of the two children. It had taken him more than
double that time to reach the abode of the Sun. The old woman consoled
him, and told him he could reach home in time by taking another route.
She said, "You will start early to-morrow morning, and follow the Sun on
his journey. You must travel as fast as you can. The way he takes is a
very straight and short course, and you may reach home in one day."

Spióola started the following morning, and, following the Sun's tracks,
he arrived at home about nightfall. As he passed the small spring, the
apple-tree, and the old horse, he informed them without stopping what
the Sun had said.

Now, Spióola rubbed the spittle on the mouths of the children, and at
once they returned to life. It was the same as if their

{p. 237}

breath had come back. When they became alive, each boy showed a luminous
spot on the forehead; on the forehead of one shone a sun, and on that of
the other a bright moon. Both were beautiful to behold.

Spióola told their mother the Goose that he was now going on another
journey to see the wise Bird, and she must warn her children of
approaching danger. He told the boys, "When you hear the Goose on the
lake calling loudly, you must go home at once and hide, for the people
may see you and kill you again." Spióola ran with all swiftness to the
house of the Bird who talked all languages, knew the future, and never
told a lie. He dwelt on the top of a pinnacle of clear ice in a snowy
region. Spióola rushed at the cliff, and just managed to climb to the
top of the ice before his claws had worn off. He told the Bird what he
had come for, and asked his help, for every one believed what he said.
The Bird answered, "I know your need is great, and I pity you." Spióola
put the Bird under his robe, and slid down the ice. He brought him to
the children, and the Bird seemed to be very glad to see them.

The day after the Bird had arrived, the father of the boys heard talking
underneath the house, and resolved to investigate its cause. Some of the
voices were like those of children. He found the entrance to their
abode, but was unable to throw down the stone which blocked it. Spióola
removed the stone, and asked him to come in. He said, "The passage is
too small. I cannot pass through." Spióola replied, "If you try, you
will manage it." He squeezed through, and was surprised to find himself
in a large room, well kept and clean, and full of many kinds of food.
When he saw the Bird there, he knew something important was going to
happen, for he never came excepting when required to settle a serious
difficulty which the chief himself and people could not decide properly.
When Spióola told all that had happened, the chief's son became
exceedingly sorry that he had killed his first wife, and had believed
her step-mother. He told his father what he had learned, and a meeting
was called for a certain day to inquire into the truth of the matter.
Meanwhile the chief gave orders that the toenail woman, or
She-who-spits-Toe-Nails, should be kept a prisoner in her house with her
mother. The doors and windows of the house were all battened and nailed
up. Now, Spióola went to the lake, and called the Goose, whom he shook
until

{p. 238}

her goose-skin fell off. She-who-spits-Gold was restored to her natural
form. She and her sons, the wise Bird, and Spióola, all attended the
meeting when the people were gathered. The Bird told the true story in
all its details, and every one believed him. He praised Spióola for his
courage in running to the house of the Sun for the breath of the
children. The chief ordered the two women to be taken out and hanged
publicly. This the people did. The chief's son took back his wife, and
they lived thenceforth in a great house, which was richly ornamented
with gold by his wife. He became chief after his father, and his son
became chief after him.

## LXXXV. THE MAGIC APPLES\[296\]

##### (PENOBSCOT: Speck, *Journal of American Folk-Lore*, xxviii, 56, No. 4)

There was a soldier in the army whose name was Jack. One day he
deserted, ran down the road, and left his horse and uniform. The general
sent a captain and a corporal after him to capture him; but when they
overtook him, Jack said, "Sit down here, and we will talk it over." Then
he asked them if they were satisfied with their job, getting only a
shilling a week, and he coaxed them to start in the world with him to
seek their fortunes.

At last they agreed, and all three started out on the road in search of
adventure. Soon they struck into a big woods, and at night saw lights
shining in the windows of a wonderful palace. When they entered, they
found it completely furnished, but without occupants. A fine meal was
spread on the table, and three beds were found made up. The only living
things they saw were three cats. After eating and smoking, three
beautiful maidens appeared and told the men that they would like them to
stay and live with them. That night they all slept together; and the
next morning found everything as before, but the beautiful women had
turned back into cats. For three nights they staid in this way; and the
last night the captain's girl told him that if he would live with her,
she would make him a present of a tablecloth which would always supply
itself with whatever food he wished. The corporal's girl told him the
same, and offered a wallet which should always be full of gold. Jack's
girl made him an offer of a cap which would transport him wherever he
wished. The men accepted the offer and received

{p. 239}

their presents. The next day, when the women had turned back into cats,
the three men proposed to travel around and see the world; so they all
put their heads together, and Jack pulled the cap over them and wished
them to be in London.

They found themselves in London at once. Soon Jack became infatuated
with a beautiful woman whom he wished to marry. She kept refusing him,
however, and putting him off till the next day. He offered her a
wonderful present. Then he went to the captain and borrowed his
tablecloth. He gave her that, but still she put him off. Then he
borrowed the corporal's wallet and gave her that, yet she put him off.
At last he begged her to give him a kiss. She laughed and agreed. Then
he slipped the cap over their heads and wished to be in the wild woods
of America. Immediately they found themselves in the heart of the wild
woods, with not a soul near them for miles.

She cried very hard, but soon begged Jack to go to sleep, and smoothed
his forehead for him. Then, when he fell asleep, she took his cap and
wished herself back in London again.

When Jack woke up, he found himself alone in the wilderness, and he
began wandering, and soon came to a great apple-tree with apples as big
as pumpkins. He tasted one, and immediately a growing tree sprouted from
his head, and he could not move. Near by, however, was another small
apple-tree whose fruit he could just reach. He ate one of these small
apples, and immediately the tree came off his head. So he gathered some
of the big apples and the little ones, and wandered on.

Soon he came out upon a great headland overlooking the ocean, and there
he saw a ship sailing by. He signalled to it, and at last the sailors
came ashore to get him. He told them he was a great doctor who had been
lost in the woods, and wanted to get back to the old country. Then they
took him on board and started back to England. Halfway across the ocean
the captain got terribly sick, and the sailors called upon Jack to try
to help him. He went down and gave the captain a piece of one of the big
apples to eat; and at once a growing tree sprang from his head, its
branches reaching way up among the masts. When the sailors saw this,
they were going to throw him overboard, but he told them to wait until
he tried his other medicine. Then he gave the captain a piece of the
small apple, and the tree came off his head. By this they knew Jack was
a great doctor.

{p. 240}

When they landed in England, Jack saw his two friends, the captain and
the corporal, sawing wood at an inn to earn their living. He went to a
town and built a shop, where he put his great apples up for sale, and
many people came to see the wonderful fruit. In the meantime Jack's
lover had built a great palace with the money from her wallet; and she
heard of the wonderful doctor and his apples; so she went to see them.
When she saw Jack, she did not know him because his beard had grown, and
thought the apples were very wonderful. She bought one at the price of
fifty dollars. When she took it home, Jack left his shop, and waited to
see what would happen. Soon the word went around that the wealthiest
woman in the kingdom had a tree growing from her head, which none of the
doctors could take off. So Jack sent word to the woman that he was a
great doctor and would guarantee to cure her.

So she sent for him, and he came. First, he told her that she had some
great mystery in her life, that she had wronged somebody. He told her
that before he could cure her, she would have to confess to him. Then
she admitted that she had wronged a man, and had taken his things and
left him. Then he told her that she would have to give up these things
before he could cure her. So she gave him a little key, and told him to
go in the cellar to a certain brick, behind which he would find the
tablecloth, the wallet, and the cap.

When he got these things, he left the palace, and soon she died for her
wrongs. He went back to his friends who were sawing wood, and gave them
their things. Now, they all started back to the palace where the three
cats were. When they arrived, they found the palace all neglected, and
the three cats looked very old. That night they turned back into three
old women, who complained bitterly of being neglected.

After they had eaten, however, the old women resumed their youth and
beauty, and that night the youngest told Jack how they were bewitched by
a great bull who lived near by. She told him that if the bull could be
killed and his heart cut out, the spell would be removed, but that
others had tried in vain. So the next morning Jack went down to his
enclosure of stone and looked over. He saw a monster bull coursing
around the inside. In the middle of the yard was a well, and a big rock
standing at one side. When the bull was at the far end of the yard, Jack
jumped the wall and ran for the well, followed by

{p. 241}

the bull. He had no sooner jumped into the well than the bull smashed
against the rock and fell over dead. Then Jack climbed out and cut out
his heart, which he took back with him. That night the three girls ate a
piece of the heart, and the spell was removed. After that they all lived
together in the palace.

## LXXXVI. MAKING THE PRINCESS LAUGH 297

##### (MICMAC: Rand, *Legends of the Micmacs*, p. 34, No. 6)

There was once a king who owned a large farm in the neighborhood of the
town where he resided; the farm was cultivated by a man who paid rent
for it to the king. This man had but one child, a son, who was
considered only about half-witted; he was very stupid, and was
continually doing silly things.

After a while his father died; but as he had left a large store of
money, the rent was easily met for a year or two. Finally a pay-day
approached when there was no cash. The mother consulted with her son as
to what was to be done. "The king will call in a day or two for his
money, and we have none for him. What can we do?" He replies, "I don't
know." She concludes to select one of the finest cows, and send the boy
off to market to sell it. He agrees to the proposal and starts with the
cow to market.

As he drives his animal along, he passes a house standing near the road;
there is a man on the steps who has come out to hail him. He inquires,
"Where are you going with that cow?" "I am driving her to market," Jack
answers. "Come in and rest yourself," says the man, pleasantly. Jack
accepts the invitation, goes in, and sits down. "I want you to make me a
present of that cow," says the man. "Can't do it," replies Jack; "but I
will be glad to sell her to you, for we are in need of the money." The
man replies that he will not buy the cow, but that he wants Jack to make
him a present of her. This the boy refuses to do. The man asks if he
will have something to eat. He answers in the affirmative, and on a tiny
dish is set before him a very small piece of food. The boy looks at the
food, and ventures to taste it. He finds it very palatable, and eats
away, but does not diminish the amount. After a while the distension of
his stomach indicates that he has eaten sufficiently; but his appetite
is as keen as ever, and the morsel that lies on the tiny plate is not in
the least diminished.\[210\] He endeavors to stop eating,

{p. 242}

but finds that he cannot do so. He has to keep on eating, whether he
will or not. So he calls out to the man, "Take away your food." The man
coolly answers, "Give me your cow, and I will." The boy answers
indignantly, "I'll do no such thing; take your dish away." "Then eat
on," quietly answers the man; and eat on he does, until he begins to
think that his whole abdominal region will burst if he continues much
longer. He gives over the contest, cries for quarter, and yields up the
cow. In return he receives the little dish with the food undiminished in
quantity or quality, remaining in it. He then returns home with the
magical food in his pocket.

Arriving at his home, he is questioned as to the success of his mission.
He relates his adventures and says, "I have been robbed of the cow." His
mother calls him a thousand fools, upbraids him outrageously, and seizes
the fire-shovel in order to knock him down. He dodges her, however, and
taking a particle of the magical food on the tip of his finger, adroitly
touches her mouth with it as he jumps by her. She stops instantly,
charmed with the exquisite taste, and inquires, "What is this that
tastes so delicious?" Thereupon he hands the dish over to her; and she
falls to eating greedily, while he quietly looks on. But soon sensations
and difficulties similar to those which he had himself experienced lead
her to call out to him to remove the plate. "Will you beat me then?" he
coolly asks. "I will," exclaims the mother, now more than ever enraged,
finding herself thus caught in a trap. "Then you may eat away," says the
boy. The indignant old lady eats on, until she can really stand the
strain no longer, when she yields, and promises to lay aside the "rod of
correction"; then he releases her by removing the tiny platter and its
contents.

The next morning the old lady sends Jack off to market with another cow.
Passing the same house, he is again accosted by the man, who is waiting
on the door-step to meet him; in the same manner as on the former
occasion, the man makes the modest request that Jack will give him the
cow. Jack, however, has learned some wisdom by his late adventure, and
has no idea of repeating the experiment. "Be off with you, you evil
spirit," he exclaims. "You robbed me yesterday; you're not going to do
it again today"; and he hurries on. The man takes off his belt, and
throws it down in the middle of the road. Instantly the belt leaps up
around both Jack and his cow, binds

{p. 243}

the animal's legs fast to her body, and lashes the boy to her side.
There they lie, unable to stir. "Untie me!" shouts the struggling boy.
"Give me your cow and I will," the man answers. "I won't do it," says
Jack. "Then lie there!" is the answer. But the belt, like a huge
boa-constrictor, begins to contract, and to press upon Jack and his cow,
so that they can scarcely draw their breath. At length the poor fellow
gives up the cow, is unfastened, receives the magic belt in return, and
goes home. He informs his mother that the same man has again robbed him.
The old woman is now more angry than ever. She calls him hard names,
threatens to beat and even to kill him, and searches for a suitable
weapon; then Jack unclasps his belt, casts it upon the floor, and
instantly the poor woman is bound hand and foot, and calls lustily to be
released. Jack looks on and says, "Will you beat me, then?" "Yes, I
will," she screams; "untie me, you dog!" Jack pulls the magic cord a
little tighter round her, and the violence of her wrath abates; she
begins to gasp, and promises if he will let her go she will not beat
him. Thereupon he unties her, and she keeps her word.

The difficulty still remains; the rent is not yet paid, and the mother
determines to make one more attempt to sell a cow. Away goes the boy
again towards the town, driving the third animal, when the same man
again encounters him with the same proposal. "Give me your cow." "Give
you my cow, indeed!" exclaims the boy in wrath. "I'll give a stone and
hurl it at your head." He is about to suit the action to the word, when
the man pulls out a tiny flute and begins to play on it. Jack's muscles
instantly contract in different directions; the stone drops from his
hand, and, literally charmed with the music, he begins to dance. The cow
joins in the jig; and both dance away with all their might, unable to
stop. "Hold! hold!" he exclaims at length; "stop your music! Let me get
my breath!" "Give me your cow, and I will," answers the man. "I won't do
it," Jack replies. "Then dance away!" is the answer; and the poor fellow
dances until he is ready to drop from very weariness. He then yields,
gives up the cow, receives the magic flute, and returns to his mother to
report his ill success for the third time. This time the old woman's
rage knows no bounds. She will kill him outright. But while she is in
the act of springing upon him with some deadly weapon,

{p. 244}

he commences operations on his magical flute. The old lady is enchanted
with the music, drops her weapon, and begins to dance, but retains her
wrath, and long persists in her determination to deal summary vengeance
upon the boy. Again and again she orders him to cease playing; but in
answer to his interrogatory, "Will you beat me then?" she answers,
"Indeed I will." Soon she becomes so weary that she can scarcely keep on
her feet, but sways to and fro, almost sinking. Finally she falls and
strikes her head with great force. She yields, and promises to let him
alone, and he withdraws the enchantment of his music.

There was another effect produced by the magic flute when the man who
met Jack commenced playing; no sooner had the boy and cow begun to
dance, than they were joined by a great swarm of hornets. These hornets
hovered over them, and danced in concert in the air; they followed the
flute; whenever it played they came, but they were invisible to all eyes
accept those of the musician, and his commands and wishes they
implicitly obeyed.

The difficulty of paying the rent remains. The mother is still in
trouble about it; but the boy quiets her fears, and undertakes to manage
the affair. " To-day," she says, "the king will be here. What can we
do?" He says to her, "I'll pay him; give yourself no uneasiness." He
then takes a lot of earthen dishes and smashes them up fine, packs the
pieces into a bag, and fills it so full that he can scarcely tie it up,
then seals the strings with gum.

Presently a carriage containing the king himself and two servants drives
up to the door. They have come to collect the rent. They enter the
house, and the terrified old woman runs and hides. The boy, however,
meets them at the door, and politely conducts them to a seat. They sit
down and wait, and he immediately fetches them what seems to be a
well-filled money-bag, and sets it down on the table, making it rattle
and chink like a bag of money, as he sets it down.

He then produces his little magic platter and food, and gravely informs
the king that his father, before he died, had given him instructions to
set that before his Majesty as a portion of exquisitely delicious food.
The king takes the bait and falls into the trap; he first tastes a
morsel, then falls to eating, and the two servants join him. Meanwhile
the boy seems to be

{p. 245}

very busy getting ready to count out the cash, bustling round, going
into another room where he remains a good while, then coming out and
lifting up the bag, and, as if having forgotten something, going back
into some other apartment of the house.

Meanwhile the king and his servants become gorged with the food; but
they can neither refrain from eating, nor push away from the enchanted
platter. They call to the boy to come and remove his dish; but he is
altogether too busy to hear or to notice them. Meanwhile their troubles
increase. Their stomachs become distended beyond endurance, and they are
glad to purchase a respite by giving up rent, house, stock, farm, and
all. On these conditions the dish and food are removed, and the king and
his retinue return to the palace, leaving the good people in quiet
possession of everything.

After they have retired, the old woman, who has been watching the
manœuvres from her hiding-place, comes out, and this time praises her
boy for his adroitness. He makes over all the property to her, and
starts off to seek his fortune and a wife, taking with him the enchanted
dish, belt, and flute.

So he travels on, and finally arrives at a town where a king resides who
has one beautiful daughter. She has many suitors, for the king has
promised her hand to the first one who will make her laugh three times
in succession. Now, it happens that our hero is very ill-shaped,
ugly-looking, and awkward, and can' by a little affectation, make
himself appear much more so than he really is. He strolls about the
city, hears the current gossip, and learns about the domestic
arrangements of the palace. So one day he strolls into the king's palace
among the other suitors and visitors, and looks round at everything, and
soon attracts the attention of the servants, who inquire what his
business is there. At first he makes no reply. But he knows that,
according to rule, unless he answers the third challenge, he will be
summarily ejected. So he answers the second time. "Is it true, as I have
heard, that the princess will marry the first man who can make her laugh
three times in succession?" He is told that it is true, and he says he
wishes to make the trial. So he is allowed to remain in the palace.

Being admitted into the apartment where the young lady is in waiting,
surrounded by her suitors, who are to be umpires in the trial, he first
brings out his magical dish with the enchanted food, and requests her to
examine and taste it. She

{p. 246}

does this cautiously, following the bent of curiosity, and finds the
taste so agreeable that she continues to eat, and offers it to the
others, who also eat. To their astonishment the quantity of food does
not diminish in the platter, nor does the taste become any less
exquisite, although their distended stomachs protest against any further
infliction. Finally the protestations of the gastric region overcome the
clamors of the palate, and they attempt to stop eating and to push away
the plate. But they can do neither the one nor the other, and so call
upon the youth to take away his food. He will do so, but upon one
condition: *the princess must laugh*. She hesitates; she had thought of
laughing only from pleasure, not from pain. She refuses to comply, but
he is inexorable; she may do what she pleases,--laugh, or continue to
eat. Finally she can hold out no longer, and she laughs, saying to
herself, "He'll not make me laugh a second time." As soon as he releases
them from the enchantment of the food, they fly furiously at him to
expel him from the palace. But they "reckon without their host." Quick
as lightning he unclasps the magic belt, tosses it on the floor, and
instantly they are all bound together in a bundle wound round from head
to foot, and lie in a helpless heap before him. "Untie us," shouts the
tortured and terrified princess. "Laugh, then," he coolly answer But no,
she will not laugh. But he knows how to bring her to terms. He has but
to will it, and the obedient belt will tighten its embrace. When she and
her guardians can endure the pressure no longer, she gives forth a
forced and feeble laugh. Then they are all released. No sooner done,
than the men draw their weapons and rush furiously at him. Before they
reach the spot where he stands, however, he has the magic flute to his
lips; their steps are arrested, and princess, suitors, umpires, guards,
and all are wheeling in the mazy dance. They are charmed, not
figuratively but literally, with the music of the tiny magic flute.

At length they grow tired of the exercise, and vainly endeavor to stop;
but they cannot do it. "Stop your playing!" they shout. "I will," he
answers, "when the princess laughs." But she determines that she will
not laugh this time, come what may. But the stakes are for a princess
and a kingdom, and he will not yield. She dances till she can no longer
stand. She falls upon the floor, striking it heavily with her head. She
then yields to her fate, performs her part nobly, and gives forth a

{p. 247}

hearty laugh. The music then ceases, the umpires are left to decide the
case, and the young man walks away and leaves them.

The news of the affair reaches the ears of the king, and he commands
that the young man shall be introduced into his presence. This is done;
and the king is disgusted with the looks and manners of the young man,
and declares the contract null and void. But the matter must be hushed
up, and not allowed to get abroad. The "victor" is to be privately
despatched, and another more suitable match substituted in his place. By
the king's direction the stranger is seized, conveyed to the menagerie,
and thrown in with the beasts. This is a large apartment surrounded by
high walls. The ferocious animals rush upon him; but the magic belt is
tossed down, and they are all tied up in a heap, their legs being bound
fast to their bodies, while he sits quietly down awaiting the issue of
events in one corner of the yard.

Meanwhile word is circulated that one of the suitors at the royal palace
has won the princess's hand, and the wedding is to be celebrated that
very evening. "All goes merrily as a marriage-bell," until the hour
arrives for the bridegroom to be introduced into the bridal chamber.
There the whole affair is quashed. Hosts of invisible foes are there who
have entered at the key-hole, and are waiting to vindicate the innocent,
defend his rights, and punish the intruder. The victorious Jack has
taken his flute and called the troops of hornets to his aid; he bids
them enter the key-hole and wait until his rival has unrobed, and then
ply him with their tiny weapons about his lower extremities. This they
do; and the poor fellow, unable to see the hornets, but fully able to
feel their stinging, begins to jump and scream like a madman. The
terrified princess rushes out of the room, and screams for help. The
domestics run to her assistance, and she declares that the bridegroom is
a maniac. They, hearing his screams and witnessing his contortions of
countenance, and unable to learn the cause, come to the same conclusion,
and hurry away from the palace. Another bridegroom is substituted, who
shares the same fate. The king at length concludes that he is
outgeneralled; that the young man who has won the hand of his daughter
still lives; that he must be a remarkable personage, possessed of
miraculous powers. He sends to the menagerie for him. The animals are
all tied up; but a thick mist fills the place, and they cannot see

{p. 248}

the young man. They attempt to release the beasts, but find this
impossible. They bring the report to the king. "Ay," said he, "it is
just as I said; he is a necromancer, a remarkable man. Go again, seek
him carefully, and if you can find him bring him in." This time they
find him. They recognize him; but he is now transformed into a most
lovely person. All admire his portly bearing and his polished manners.
The wedding is consummated with great pomp. He builds a splendid palace,
and, when the old king dies, is crowned in his place.

## LXXXVII. THE CLEVER NUMSKULL\[298\]

##### (MICMAC: Rand, *Legends of the Micmacs*, p. 326, No. 57)

Three brothers lived together. They had no sisters, and their mother was
sick. The youngest was supposed to be a silly fellow, and was always
doing outrageous things. One day they killed a pig. The two older
brothers went to fetch salt, and told the youngest one to remain and
watch the house, and take care of their mother and the pig. They said
they were going to salt down the pork, and keep it for the long days.
After they were gone, he went out and found some men at work, and told
them that if there was a man there named Longdays, he had a pig for him.
One of them declared that that was his name; forthwith the pig was
delivered to him, and he carried it off. By and by the other brothers
arrived, and wondered what had become of the pig. "Why, Longdays has
been here and taken it away! Did not you say it was to be kept for Mr.
Longdays?" "Oh, you blockhead! we told you it was to be kept for
ourselves when the days become long next summer."

Some time after this, Coolnajoo was sent to buy a horse. He made the
purchase, and brought the horse home. But there was a long avenue, lined
by trees and bushes, extending from the highway down to the house; and
when he came to the head of this lane, he gravely told the horse that
this was the road, and bade him go on directly to the house. Saying
this, he removed the halter; and the horse kicked up his heels and made
for home. The boy arrived home, wondering at the stupidity of the horse;
and on relating the case to his brothers, they wondered at his
stupidity. "You numskull!" they exclaimed, "you can never do anything
right. Why did you not ride him down the lane?" "Oh, I will do better
next time," he promised.

{p. 249}

So, as the old mother got no better, they sent him to find and bring
home a woman to assist in nursing her and in taking care of the house.
He took his bridle and started. He succeeded in his expedition, and the
woman came with him all quiet and kindly till they reached the head of
the lane; but there and then he made an attempt to put the bridle on her
head, and assured her that she had to carry him on her back, and walk on
all fours down to the house. Persisting in his determination, the
terrified woman screamed, broke from her persecutor, and ran.

Chopfallen and sad, he went into the house. What was his trouble? they
asked him. "Why! I attempted to bring her home in the way you directed;
but she screamed and tore away from me, and crying went back, as hard as
she could go.--"Oh, you abominable fool!" they exclaimed; "was that the
way to treat a woman? You should have taken her by the arm, and
occasionally given her a kiss." "Ah, well!" he cried, "I shall know
better next time."

The next time he was sent for a pig. He led the pig all right until he
came to the lane. He then tried to make the pig walk on his hind legs;
and when the terrified animal squealed and kicked, he attempted to
conciliate it by kissing it; but he received such a return from the
tusks of his captive as made the blood flow, and caused him to let go
his grip,--and poor piggy went off home at the top of his speed.

Poor Coolnajoo returned crestfallen to his home, to relate his
adventures, and to be blamed and lectured for the hundredth time for his
outrageous stupidity.

His next expedition was for a tub of hog's-lard. This he purchased; but
on his way home he passed over a portion of road that was dried and
cracked by the sun. "Oh, my old grandfather!" he exclaimed, "what a
terribly sore back you have got,--so naked and dry! You shall have my
lard for salve, and 1 will rub it on." So saying, he began spreading the
lard over the dry road; and when it was all gone, he went home. "Why
have you not brought the lard?" "Oh, dear me! I came across a poor old
man lying in the road with his back all sore and cracked; and I pitied
him, and spread the lard over him." To this the brothers made no
objection until they ascertained the truth of the case; when another
attempt was made to teach him a lesson, and with the usual success.

{p. 250}

His sixth expedition was in quest of a quantity of needles. These were
purchased, but on his way home he passed a newly reaped field of grain.
He looked at the stubble, and perceived the holes in the top; he was
sure that when the rain should fall, the water would fill all those
holes, and concluded that it would be a very benevolent act to stop them
up. This would be a capital end to which to apply his needles. So he
opened the packages, and carefully placed one in every straw; and when
the supply was exhausted, many remained undoctored. "Alas, poor things!"
he cried, "I cannot help you any more, as my stock is out." So he went
home without his needles.

Afterward he was sent for some red flannel. Passing a graveyard on his
way home, he looked at the crosses, and took them for poor old penitents
kneeling in the cold with outstretched arms, and carefully tore up his
roll of red flannel and covered their poor shivering shoulders.

After this the two other brothers went together to town to make some
purchases, and left him to take care of the sick mother. They charged
him to give her drink, and especially to wash her face. He obeyed the
directions, but supposed he must wash her face as he had seen her wash
clothes,--by thrusting them into boiling water. So he set on the great
pot; and when the water was boiling, he took up the old woman and thrust
her head into it, and held her there. When he took her out, she was
dead, and her lips were contracted to a grin, which he affected to
mistake for laughter'. and placed her back in the bed, and leaped and
laughed at her quiet and pleasant countenance. He ran to meet his
brothers, and told them that their mother had not been so quiet nor
looked so well this long time. She had not stirred nor spoken, and she
was laughing all the time. They went in, and were horror-stricken. "Oh,
you outrageous simpleton! what have you done? You have killed your
mother. We shall all be executed for murder."

But now Coolnajoo began to exhibit his shrewdness, and soon became as
clever as he had hitherto been simple. "Never you fear," said he; "we
will turn the incident to good account, we will make some money out of
it. Wait you here; I will run for the priest." So off he ran posthaste,
and informed the priest that his mother was dying, and requested him to
come with all haste, to perform over her the indispensable rite of
extreme unction. The priest started immediately; but Coolnajoo outran

{p. 251}

him, and took his dead mother and placed her against the door, inside.
The priest reached the house, burst the door open, and tumbled the old
woman over. Coolnajoo sprang to raise her. Alas! she was dead. "Oh!" he
exclaimed, wringing his hands and weeping, "you have killed our mother!"
All three gathered round, and the horrified priest did not know what to
do. They threatened to accuse him of the murder. He finally succeeded in
pacifying them, and gave them a whole handful of money to hush up the
matter and say nothing about it.

The development of his shrewdness proceeded. The two other brothers went
away one day, and left the place in his charge. Among other occupations
he had to tend the pigs. These he sold; but in order to cheat his
brothers, he cut off their tails and took them down to a quagmire near
the shore, and stuck them all up in the sand. When they came back and
inquired for the pigs, he told them they had broken out of the pen and
rushed down toward the shore, and had sunk in the quagmire. They went
down to see; and sure enough, there they all were, just the tips of
their tails sticking above the ground. They seized hold of the tails,
and tried to draw up the porkers; but the tails broke, and down into the
mire sank the bodies, as they believed, and could not be found.

Soon his pranks became unbearable, and the brothers resolved to make
away with him. They concluded to drown him. So they tied him up in a
bag, and took him down below high water mark and buried him,--not deep,
however,--and left him to be drowned when the tide came in. They
returned; and he soon heard the "Uh! uh! uh!" of a drove of hogs, and
called lustily for them to come to his aid. If they would uncover and
untie him, he would lead them to a place where they could feast on
chickweed to their hearts' content. The hogs, attracted by the noise,
approached the spot. Their noses were soon thrust deep into the soft
earth. The bag was soon reached, and instinct alone was sufficient to
pull it out; and they soon removed the string,--when up jumped
Coolnajoo, who seized one of his deliverers, transferred him to the bag,
and the bag to the hole, drove the others away to the field of
chickweed, where they were kept busy till the tide returned and covered
the spot where he was supposed to lie.

{p. 252}

In due time the tide receded, and compunction returned to the brothers'
hearts; they repaired to the spot and dug up the bag, mournfully
chanting, "Our poor brother is dead." Astonishment seized them when, on
opening the bag, there, instead of the brother's corpse, was a dead pig.
Meanwhile Coolnajoo had waited at a distance from the spot until his
brothers went down to the shore to look for him. When they returned, he
was astride the ridge-pole, laughing at them.

They made another attempt to kill him. This time they planned better;
they would take him to a waterfall and toss him in above, and let him be
dashed to pieces in going over the rapids. So they tied him up in a bag
again, placed it across a pole, and started for the waterfall. They
became hungry on the way, and placed him by the side of the road, and
went to get some dinner. While they were gone, a drover came by; and
seeing the bag, he went up and gave it a kick. "Halloa!" he exclaimed,
"what is all this?" Coolnajoo replied, and informed the drover that he
and his brothers were on a money-hunting expedition; concealed in this
bag, so as not to excite suspicion, he was to be taken to a certain
place where they would all make their fortunes. He gave such a glowing
account of the matter, and with such apparent truthfulness and
sincerity, that the drover was deceived, and offered him a whole drove
of cattle and sheep for his chance in the money-hunting speculation. The
bargain was struck, and the parties exchanged places. But Coolnajoo gave
his substitute some cautions: "You must be cautious not to speak, or the
cheat will be discovered; my brothers must not mistrust that it is not
I. By and by you will hear the roar of a waterfall; do not be
frightened. Before lowering you to the place where you are to find the
money, they may give you two or three swings. You must keep still, and
not speak; and after that you can have it all your own way." So saying,
he went on to the market with the drove. The brothers came back to the
bag. "Are you there?" they asked. No answer. But they saw that all was
right, placed the bag on the pole, the pole on their shoulders, and
moved on.

When they came to the waterfall, they approached as near as they could,
and then gave him three swings in order to send him as far out as
possible; and just as they let go, the terrified man sang out. They were
startled at the voice; it sounded like a stranger's voice. They returned
home, and shortly after

{p. 253}

their brother arrived with his pockets full of money,--the proceeds of
his drove of cattle and sheep.

So they concluded to share the spoil and remain together. But one night
a band of robbers was seen advancing upon them, and they ran for their
lives. Coolnajoo was the last to leave the house and the others told him
to "bring the door to after him,"--meaning, of course, that he shall
shut the door. He obeyed to the letter,--took the door off the hinges,
and carefully brought it after him. They made for the woods, and took
shelter in a tree,--Coolnajoo dragging the door up after him, and
holding it carefully all the while. The robbers came up to the same
tree, kindled a fire under it, cooked and ate their dinner, and then
began counting and dividing their gold. While this process was going on,
Coolnajoo got tired of holding the door, and dropped it down among them.
It fell with a noise that terrified the robbers, who supposed that it
had fallen from the sky; so they ran off as fast as their legs could
carry them, and left everything behind,--gold, food, and dishes. Down
scrambled our heroes, and gathered all up and ran; finally they came to
a house, where they remained all night. They divided the money; but
Coolnajoo claimed the largest share, as he declared that it was through
his efforts that it had been obtained. The next night they called and
stayed all night at another strange house. Coolnajoo became thirsty, and
hunted around for a drink. Feeling carelessly about, he thrust his two
hands into a pitcher, and could not withdraw them. He went out-of-doors,
and looked around for something to strike the pitcher against, in order
to break it. At length he saw what seemed in the darkness to be a white
rock. He gave the pitcher a smart blow in order to free his hands; when,
alas! he had struck a young woman in the head, and killed her with the
blow. At the sight of what he had done, he was terribly frightened, and
called up his brothers. He told them what had happened, and proposed
immediate flight. They all departed; and his brothers, fearing that
Coolnajoo would ultimately get them into difficulties from which they
would be unable to extricate themselves, separated from him. By mutual
consent the partnership was dissolved. They went each his own way.

Coolnajoo was bent on making money, and an opportunity occurred soon. He
kept his eye on the robbers, and saw them

{p. 254}

going out to bury a dead child; he watched to see where they deposited
the body, and also followed them unseen to their retreat. When night
came, he took up the corpse they had buried, and went up to their house.
The window was open, and he looked in; they were busy counting and
dividing their ill-gotten booty. Piles of money covered the table, and
he heard all the accounts of their expeditions. All at once he sent the
dead baby flying in among them,--which so frightened them that they took
to their heels and left all behind. He leaped in, gathered all the
money, and left for home.

He now determined to settle, and to this end built a small house. One
day a heavy rain-storm came on; and just at nightfall two weary priests,
wet to the skin, called and requested a night's lodging. This he
refused, as he had no accommodations for strangers. They pleaded hard,
and offered him a large reward; this he accepted, and kept them until
morning, but managed to exact a still further contribution from them
before their departure.

## LXXXVIII. THE FOX AND THE WOLF\[299\]

##### (MENOMINI: Skinner, *Journal of American Folk-Lore*, xxvi, 72, No. 2)

Very long ago there were two men living together, and making
maple-sugar. They made one *mokok* ("bark box") of sugar, and then they
cached it away, burying it, and said to each other, "We will let it
remain here until we are very hungry."

The younger man was a Fox, and he was a good hunter. Every time he went
out, he brought home chickens or small wild game. The other man was a
greedy Wolf, and he never killed anything, or brought anything home: so
Fox thought he would play a trick on his chum for being lazy.

"You ought to go over to that house," said Fox to Wolf. "Maybe they will
give you something to eat. When I went over there, they gave me a
chicken."

So Wolf went over as he was told. When he got to the house, he did not
hide himself, but went in open sight. The owner of the house saw the
Wolf coming up; so he set his dogs on him to drive him away; and Wolf
escaped only by running into the river.

"So it is this one that takes off our chickens!" said the man.

When Wolf arrived at his home, he told his younger brother, Fox, "Why, I
hardly escaped from that man!"

{p. 255}

"Why!" said Fox to him. "They did not recognize you; that's why." But
Wolf made no answer.

While they were in the house together, Fox went outside, and cried,
"*He!*" to deceive Wolf.

"What's the matter with you?" asked Wolf.

"Oh! they have come after me to give a name to a child."

"Then you'd better go over. Maybe they will give you something to eat."

Instead of going, however, Fox went to their cache of maple-sugar, and
ate some of it. When he returned, Wolf asked him, "What did you name the
baby?"

"*Mokimon*," replied Fox; and this word means to "reveal" or "dig out"
something you have hidden.

At another time, while they were sitting together, Fox said, "*He!*" and
"Oh, yes!"

"What's that?" inquired Wolf.

"Oh, I am called to give a name to a newborn baby."

"Well, then, go. Maybe they will give you something to eat." So Fox went
and returned.

"What's the name of the child?" asked Wolf.

This time, Fox answered, "*Wapiton*," and this word means "to commence
to eat."

At another time, time, Fox cried out, "*He!*" and "All right!" as though
some one had called to him, "I'll come."

"What's that?" asked Wolf.

"They want me to go over and name their child."

"Well, then, go," says Wolf. "You always get something to eat every time
they want you."

So Fox went, and soon returned.. Wolf asked him again, "What name did
you give it?"

"*Hapata kiton*," answered Fox; that is to say, "half eaten."

Then another time Fox cried "*He!*" as if in answer to some one speaking
to him, and then, as though some one called from the distance, "*Hau!*"

Wolf, as he did not quite hear, asked Fox what the matter was.

"Oh, nothing!" replied Fox, "only they want me to come over and name
their child."

"Well, then, you'd better go. Maybe you'll get a chance to eat; maybe
you'll fetch me something too."

So Fox started out, and soon returned home.

{p. 256}

"Well, what name did you give this time?" asked Wolf.

"*Noskwaton*," said Fox; and this means "all licked up."

Then Wolf caught on. "Maybe you are eating our stored maple-sugar!" he
cried. But Fox sat still and laughed at him.

Then Wolf went over and looked at their cache. Sure enough, he found the
empty box with its contents all gone, and pretty well licked up.
Meantime Fox skipped out, and soon found a large tree by the river,
leaning out over the water. He climbed into its branches and hid there.
Presently the angry Wolf returned home, and, not finding Fox, tracked
him to the tree. Wolf climbed part way to Fox without seeing him, as he
was on the branches. Then Wolf was afraid, and while he was hesitating,
he happened to look at the water, and there he saw the reflection of Fox
laughing at him on the surface.\[270\] The Wolf, in a fury, plunged into
the bottom of the stream, but of course failed to catch Fox. He tried
four times, and after the fourth attempt he was tired, and quit jumping
in for a while. While he was resting, he looked up and saw Fox laughing
at him. Then Wolf said to Fox, "Let's go home and make up"; for he
thought in his heart that anyway Fox was feeding him all the time.

By and by it became winter. Fox frequently went out, and returned with
abundance of fish.

"How do you manage to get so many?" asked Wolf.

"You'd better go out and try for yourself," said Fox. "The way I do,
when I am fishing, is to cut a hole in the ice. I put my tail in,
instead of a line, and I remain there until I feel bites. I move ahead a
little to let the fish string on my tail; but I stay a long time, until
I get a great many fish on my tail. When it feels pretty heavy, I jerk
it out, and catch all I want."

Fox was in hopes that he could get Wolf frozen to death in the ice, and
so avoid the necessity of feeding him any longer. So he took Wolf out,
and cut five holes in the ice,--one for his tail, and one for each
paw,--telling him he could catch more fish that way. Wolf staid there to
fish all night. Every once in a while he would move his feet or tail a
little, and they felt so heavy, he was sure he was getting a tremendous
load; and he staid a little longer. In the mean time he was freezing
fast in the ice. When he found out the predicament he was in, he jerked
backwards and forwards again and again, until all the hair wore off his
tail, and there he was. He thought he had let too many fish on his tail
and feet to haul them out, and he

{p. 257}

worked hard to free himself. At last he wore his tail out at the surface
of the ice, and pulled off his claws and the bottoms of his feet. Fox
told him he had caught too many fish, and that they had bitten his tail
and feet; and Wolf believed it.

Another time, Fox found a wasp's nest in a tree: so he went home and
told Wolf that there was honey in it, and persuaded him to try and jump
up and get it, on the plea that Wolf could jump higher than he could. As
soon as Wolf set out to try, Fox ran away, and Wolf was nearly stung to
death. Fox fled over a wagon-road to conceal his tracks, and as he
travelled, he met a negro with a team, hauling a load of bread. Fox,
cunning as he was, lay down on the side of the road and pretended that
he was dead. The negro saw him lying there, and picked him up and put
him in his wagon behind his load. Fox very presently came to, and,
waiting for his chance, he would throw off a loaf of bread every now and
then, till he had gotten rid of a good many, Then he jumped off, and
carried the loaves to a secret place, where he built him a shelter, and
prepared to live for a time.

In the mean time, Wolf came along, half starved, and crippled from his
meddling with a live wasp's nest and from his fishing experience.

Fox fed him on his arrival, and said, "You ought to do the way I did.
It's easy to get bread. I got mine by playing dead on the road.
To-morrow the negro will pass by with another load; and you can watch
for him and do as I did, and steal his bread."

Next morning, Wolf started out to watch the road and pretty soon he saw
the negro coming with a big load of bread: so he lay down beside the
road, where the {negro} could see him, and played dead. The {negro} did
see him, sure enough; and he stopped his team, and got off and got a big
stick, and knocked Wolf over the head, and killed him dead for sure.

"I will not get fooled this time!" he said, "for yesterday I lost too
many loaves of bread for putting a dead Fox in my wagon without
examining him!"

So he did take the Wolf home dead. That ended him, and since then Fox
has eaten alone.

## LXXXIX. THE TAR-BABY\[300\]

##### (CHEROKEE: Mooney, *Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology*, xix, 272)

Once upon a time there was such a severe drought that all streams; of
water and all lakes were dried up. In this emergency the beasts
assembled together to devise means to procure water. It was proposed by
one to dig a well. All agreed to do so except the hare. She refused
because it would soil her tiny paws. The rest, however, dug their well
and were fortunate enough to find water. The hare, beginning to suffer
and thirst and having no right to the well, was thrown upon her wits to
procure water. She determined, as the easiest way, to steal from the
public well. The rest of the animals, surprised to find that the hare
was so well supplied with water, asked her where she got it. She replied
that she arose betimes in the morning and gathered the dewdrops. However
the wolf and the fox suspected her of theft and hit on the following
plan to detect her:

They made a wolf of tar and placed it near the well. On the following
night the hare came as usual after her supply of water. On seeing the
tar wolf she demanded who was there. Receiving no answer she repeated
the demand, threatening to kick the wolf if he did not reply. She
receiving no reply kicked the wolf, and by this means adhered to the tar
and was caught. When the fox and wolf got hold of her they consulted
what it was best to do with her. One proposed cutting her head off. This
the hare protested would be useless, as it had often been tried without
hurting her. Other methods were proposed for dispatching her, all of
which she said would be useless. At last it was proposed to let her
loose to perish in a thicket. Upon this the hare affected great
uneasiness and pleaded hard for life. Her enemies, however, refused to
listen and she was accordingly let loose. As soon, however, as she was
out of reach of her enemies she gave a whoop, and bounding away she
exclaimed.: "This is where I live."\[108\]

## XC. THE TURTLE'S RELAY RACE\[301\]

##### (ARIKARA: Dorsey, *Publications of the Carnegie Institution*, xvii, 143, No. 56)

One time a Coyote met a Turtle. The Coyote began to boast of his
swiftness, and the Turtle said, "Why, I can beat you

{p. 259}

running!" So the Coyote said, "We will run a race to-morrow." That night
they parted, and went to their homes, so that they could get ready for
the race the next morning. After the Turtle reached home he began to
worry, and he could not get to sleep, for he knew that the Coyote could
run fast. But the Turtle said to himself: "I will take him up there and
go to the other Turtles, and ask them to assist me." So the Turtle went
to the other Turtles, and said: "I am about to run a race with the
Coyote. I want you to help me." He told them the place where they were
to run, and the distance they were to run. So several Turtles
volunteered to go and help the Turtle to beat the Coyote.

All the Turtles went to the place. They placed one Turtle at the end of
the course; then they placed another one at a certain distance back of
him; then another back of this one, and so on, and finally the Turtle
himself took his stand. Each Turtle carried a long pole, and hid in the
ground.

The next morning the Turtle met the Coyote. The Coyote began to run
around and was happy, for he thought that he was going to beat the
Turtle. The Turtle and the Coyote got ready to start. The Turtle gave
the command to start. The Coyote ran and the Turtle crawled into his
hole. When he got over a little ridge the Coyote saw the Turtle going
ahead of him. Coyote ran and caught up with the Turtle. The Turtle threw
his pole away and crawled into the ground. When the Coyote got to
another knoll, there was the Turtle ahead of him again. The Coyote
caught up with him. The Turtle crawled into the ground. The Coyote ran,
and when he got up to another hill, there was the Turtle going ahead.
The Coyote caught up with and passed him. At the end, the Turtle was at
the goal, and the Coyote got up, and said, "You have beaten me." This
fine stretch of running killed the Coyote.

## XCI. THE PEACE FABLE\[302\]

##### (WYANDOT: Barbeau, *Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Canada: Anthropological Series*, xi, 210, No. 65)

As he was travelling one day, the Fox saw his cousin the Rooster perched
high upon a tree. "Come down, cousin!" exclaimed the Fox, "let us have a
chat!" The Rooster replied, "Oh, no!" And the Fox went on saying, "We
all live in peace now, and

{p. 260}

have arranged not to slay each other any longer." The rooster then
warned the Fox, "I hear something, cousin; I hear the hounds rushing
this way." The Fox said, "Oh! I must be going!" But the Rooster
objected, "No! You have just told me that we all live in peace now, and
that we must not kill each other any longer!" The Fox explained, "I must
be going! They have not yet received word as we have."

So the old Fox has been running ever since.

## XCII. THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER\[303\]

##### (SHUSWAP: Teit, Jesup North Pacific Expedition, ii, 655)

Grasshopper lived with the people who were busy catching and curing
salmon. They said to him, "Come help us. It is the salmon season. We
must all work, that we may have a plentiful store of salmon for the
winter." Grasshopper answered, "No, I do not like to work. I like to
amuse myself playing, jumping, and making a noise. I do not need salmon.
I like to eat grass, of which there is great plenty all around here."
Soon winter came, and the grass was all covered deep with snow. Then
Grasshopper was cold and hungry. Finding nothing to eat, and being in a
starving condition, he begged the people to give him some dried salmon.
This they refused to do, telling him to go and play, and eat grass. When
he was nearly dead, they transformed him, saying, "Henceforth you shall
be the grasshopper and, as you were too lazy and thoughtless to catch
salmon, you shall live on grass, and spend your time jumping around and
making much noise."
