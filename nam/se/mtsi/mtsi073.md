### 71. RABBIT FOOLS COYOTE (69)

The Rabbit and the Coyote were great friends. One time when the Rabbit
was traveling along he saw a colt lying asleep in the road. He Went on
and came to the Coyote and said, "I see something good for you to eat
over there. If you wish I will drag him out of the road to a place where
you can make a feast off of him, while I go and get my own food." The
Coyote said, "All right," so they went along to the place where the colt
was lying. Then Rabbit said, "I am not strong

enough so I will tie his tail to yours and help you by pushing." Then
Rabbit tied their tails carefully so as not to awaken the colt, took the
colt by the ears, and began lifting him. Upon this the colt woke up and
started to run off, dragging the coyote after him. The Coyote struggled
frantically, but all he could do was scratch on the ground with his
claws. Rabbit shouted after him, "Pull with all your might." "How can
anyone pull with all his might," answered Coyote, "when he is not
standing on the ground?" By and by, however, the Coyote got loose, and
then Rabbit had to run to cover.
