### 39. THE OWL AND THE TURKEY

An Owl was once traveling along and met a Turkey. They talked together
and the Owl said, "I have a good song." The Turkey answered, "Suppose we
swap our songs." "All right," said the Owl, and flying away he perched
upon a limb and hooted (said "owa"). When the Owl got back the Turkey
said, "Yours is a good one." Then the Turkey ran to a distance, stopped,
and turned back many times gobbling. While he was doing so the Owl ran
away with his song and hid it. The Turkey ran away with his song and
disappeared. Then the Turkey was very happy. And the gobble which was
formerly his the Owl got.

Then the Owl did not want it. "I don't like it," he said. Wanting him to
take it back, he ran with it into a big thicket in pursuit of him.
