### 41. THE STORY OF WÅHGALĀNOH <span id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_60.md)

There was a male child whose father was unknown and all the creatures
assembled to try to discover who it was. They said, "Each of you make an
arrow and bring it here, and call to him to come and

get it. The one whose arrow he comes to get will be his father." When
all were assembled one of them said, "Boy, come and get the arrow." All
said the same thing to no purpose. The boy did not respond. When they
were through they heard someone shouting in the distance. "We thought we
were all here," they said. The person kept on shouting and proved to be
the Wåhgalānoh (a bird with long legs like a crane) bringing a fish
which he had caught. "That is my father," said the boy. Then all ran off
and disappeared.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_60"></span>[198:1](mtsi241.htm#fr_60.md) Wåhgalānoh seems to
mean "yellow crane."
