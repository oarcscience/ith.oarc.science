### 27. THE MAN WHO BECAME A SNAKE (35)

### (FIFTH VERSION)

Two friends went out hunting. They came to the shore of a great lake,
and on the shore found a big egg, which one of them brought back to
camp. His friend told him it might not be good, but he said "I am going
to cook it anyhow." So he cooked and ate it, and then the two lay down
to sleep on opposite: sides of the fire. During the night the one who
had eaten the egg awakened his companion. "My friend, what is the
matter?" said the other. "Look and see what is the matter with me." His
friend looked and saw that the legs of the other were glued together. By
and by the same one called to his friend to look at him again, and he
found that from his body on down was the tail of a snake. At daybreak he
said again, "Look at me now," and behold he had turned completely into a
snake which lay there in a big coil. Then the Snake said, "You must
leave me, but first pilot me to the hole from which we got water." They
got there and the Snake went in, whereupon the earth, trees, and
everything else caved in, producing a big water hole. Then the Snake
raised his head out of the water and said, "Tell my parents and my
sisters to come and see me." So the friend went home and told them, and
they asked him to guide them back to the place where the Snake had been
left. When they got to the shore the Snake showed himself in the middle
of the pond. He came to the bank and crawled out, and he crawled over
the laps of his parents and his other friends, shedding tears. Then he
returned into the water and they went home. So the tie-snake was created
from a human being.
