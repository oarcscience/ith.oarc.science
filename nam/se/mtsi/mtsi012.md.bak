### 10. THE ORIGIN OF TOBACCO (15)

There was an old man who went to the square ground of his town to take
the black drink every morning and carried something to eat with him. One
morning as he was eating this by the creek where he had stopped for the
purpose, he felt like defecating, and therefore he went over to a log
which lay at some distance. When he got there, however, he saw a pretty
little plant growing. A man and a woman had lain at that place, and this
plant was the result. The old man brushed the rubbish away from it and
returned home. Each time he came by after that he went to it, and he
took the dry lower leaves and smoked them. The people at the square
ground learned of it through him and said, "That is a mighty good thing.
We had better take that and smoke it." The first name of the plant was
"coeuns" (haisa). After they learned of it and came to value it they
made it a warrior (tåsikaya), and gave it the name hitci ("finding") as
a war name. I do not know the history of the hitci påkpågi, which is the
greatest medicine there is.
