### 68. WHY THE OPOSSUM LOOKS ASHAMED (60)

(Tuggle collection)

One time an Opossum got very hungry. He went about the world hunting
something to eat. At last he looked up into a tree and saw some big
balls hanging low down on the limbs. They looked so fine that he danced
around the tree for joy.

After his dance he jumped up and caught one of the balls and mashed it
in his mouth. It was very bitter, for it was an oak ball. He felt so bad
that he crawled away, lay down, and made out that he was dead. Whenever
anyone comes where he is, he remembers his mistake and feels ashamed of
having been so badly deceived.
