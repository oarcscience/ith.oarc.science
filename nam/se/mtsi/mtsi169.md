### 33. THE BEAR PEOPLE (29)

### (SECOND VERSION)

A man of the Bear clan (Nita ayeksa) living in a certain village went
hunting deer, and while walking around met a Bear. "How many men of your
clan are there?" said the Bear. He told him how many there were. Then
the Bear said, "I am going to come on the fourth day. I am going to kill
all of the people. All of you \[Bear people\] hang up a white cloth. I
will not kill anyone at your camp." Some of the men did not believe
this. On the morning of the fourth day the bears came and the people
took their guns to kill them. Many little and big bears came and killed
all of the people but left those who had a white cloth hung out.
