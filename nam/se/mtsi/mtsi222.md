### 22. THE GIANT DEER (46)

### (SECOND VERSION OF ABOVE)

There was once but one deer, kept in a certain place, and
Beemartin <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md) went about with him to
watch him. While they were traveling around the bird slept and the deer
disappeared. Then he went to ask the deer's whereabouts of Flying
Squirrel, who went in all directions and then said, "He is on a forested
island toward the south in the middle of the ocean." By and by they
called him from a distance, and when the deer came near a man, a pygmy,
a Panther, a Dog, a Wolf, and a Wildcat stood together to meet him. When
the deer came near he made a noise, and the Wildcat when he heard it was
very much afraid and cried out, "Ahē'+ya hiya'." When it got very near
he said, "I want very much to defecate," and ran off. When the deer
arrived the pygmy shot first. The human being shot next. The Dog was too
slow, and the Wolf was first to jump upon him. Next the Panther jumped
upon him and threw him down, and they killed him. The Wildcat came and
chewed him and stayed by him. After the deer had been killed they gave
only the horns to the Flying Squirrel. They kept pulling out his hair
and throwing it about, and his tail, which was very white, was made to
go around. From that time there came to be lots of deer, and they came
to have hair. Because they gave the Flying Squirrel only the horns he
likes nothing but horns to-day.
