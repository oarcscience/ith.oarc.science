### 9. THE ONLY SON AND RABBIT (6)

(Tuggle collection)

A widow had an only son, whom she cautioned never to pass beyond the
mountains, which were in sight of her home. "My boy, never pass the
mountains, never go beyond," was her constant warning.

One day while hunting he reached the top of the mountains and on looking
into the valley beneath he saw a lovely city, surrounded by green
meadows, lakes, and groves. He was tempted to visit so lovely a spot and
yielded. He saw scenes of beauty and fair maidens.

When he returned home in the evening he sat by himself and looked
lonesome and his mother saw from his manner that something unusual had
occurred.

"My son, you have passed beyond the mountains." "I have, mother; I had
beautiful visions."

"Ah," sighed his mother, "that is why I warned you. All who see the
lovely city are never contented elsewhere. I knew home would

lose its attractions when you wandered over the mountains. Since it must
be so I will do all I can for you."

The next day she made for her son a wonderful costume. She sent him to
the forest to catch all manner of singing birds. She made for him also a
flute. When all of her preparations were completed, she arrayed her son
in the new costume and arranged for him a peculiar headdress, on which
sat the singing birds.

"Now try your flute," she said, and at the first sound of the flute, the
birds began to sing, keeping time to the music of their master.

"Go, my son, to the beautiful city beyond the mountains. When within the
city, ask for the council of the king and as you enter the, council
ground play on your flute, while your singing birds accompany you."

He passed the mountain and as he approached the city he began to play,
while the birds sang. The crowd which gathered and watched the stranger
with the wonderful birds told him where the king dwelt. He entered the
council, playing on his flute, while his birds sang.

A seat of honor was offered the musical stranger and all were enraptured
with his music. Ere he had been there long, no honor was too great for
him and everyone strove to do him some kindness. Soon it was rumored
that the daughter of the king was to be given as a bride to the young
stranger.

One day he invited the king and his council to go with him to a river
near the city. On reaching the stream he quickly cast aside his costume,
plunged into the water and dived under and crossed the river four times,
when all the fish came to the surface and were killed with arrows and a
great feast was enjoyed.

The Rabbit, envious of the wonderful stranger, had followed the crowd
and while all were intent on killing the fish, he stole the costume of
the musical youth and ran away to the woods. On coming out of the river
the garments could not be found. No one knew what had become of them.

The next day when the council was assembled, behold the Rabbit strutted
in, puffing and blowing with all his might at the flute and, as the
birds would not utter a note, he hit at them and said: "Why don't you
sing?" He was dressed in the costume of the stranger and before he could
be seized he said: "Well, come with me to the river and let us enjoy
another feast."

Away he ran and the council followed him. In he jumped, casting the
costume and flute on the ground, and though he crossed four times under
the water not a fish appeared.

As his head came above the water they all cried:

It is the lying Rabbit.  
It is the lying Rabbit.  
Seize him, seize him.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

He was tried by the council and chased from the council ground as an
envious and rascally deceiver.

The king's daughter was married to the wonderful stranger and, as their
hands were joined, the singing birds flapped their wings and sang with
wild melody.
