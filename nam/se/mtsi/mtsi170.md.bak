### 34. THE BEAR'S REVENGE (30)

A man setting out to hunt bear saw a small female Bear on the top of a
hollow tree. He climbed up to it and got inside with the little Bear. He
took the little Bear up, tied beads around its neck and stayed with it.
By and by the Bear's mother came in and he was afraid, but the big Bear
said, "Do not fear me," so he stayed with her one night. The next
morning he started off and reached camp. But before he left the female
Bear said, "Do not tell them anything about us." However, when the men
all said, "Did you find the hollow tree?" that man replied "I found it."
So they set out. They set fire to some old spunk. When they threw it
inside, the Bear's mother came out. While she was coming down they shot
at her but missed her. She reached the ground and ran to the camp. When
she got there the man was lying on the top of a high scaffold which he
had made, but when the Bear reached it she pulled it down and killed
him. When the other men got back he lay dead but they did not know the
reason.
