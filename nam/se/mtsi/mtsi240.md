### 40. THE STORY OF OWL AND LITTLE YELLOW MOUSE

An Owl went to the house of a little yellow Mouse, wanting to catch him,
and sat down there. Then the Owl asked him, "What do people call me when
they hear me hoot?" The Mouse answered, "Well, they call you
Night-chief." At this the Owl laughed and was pleased. After a while he
said again, "What do they call me?" "They call you Night-chief." He kept
repeating this question until the Mouse became angry. When he said
again, "What do they call me when I hoot?" the Mouse answered, "Some
call you Owl-big-eye." Upon that he disappeared into his house, and the
Owl said, "Ē+yeē', I shall never cease to be angry with you." He watched
right at the door of Mouse's house until he died of hunger and thirst.
