### 63. TURKEY, TURTLE, AND RATTLESNAKE (42)

(Tuggle collection)

Once upon a time the beasts, birds, and reptiles held a council to
devise means of destroying their enemy, Man. It was decided that he must
die. The Rattlesnake, being the most poisonous, was chosen

to kill him; the Turtle was selected to bite off his scalp lock; while
the Turkey was to run away with it. In accordance with this arrangement
the three repaired to the cabin of Man during the night and while he was
asleep. The Rattlesnake coiled himself up near the door, so that he
could strike Man as he came out, the Turtle took a position round the
corner of the house, and the Turkey stationed himself behind it.

When morning came Man awoke and stepped out. The Rattlesnake heard him
coming and when he was sufficiently near struck his fangs deep into his
leg. Man fell down and died. Then the Turtle crawled up to his head and
after much labor bit off the scalplock, and the Turkey seized it and ran
off with it. In his race he accidentally swallowed the scalplock, and
ever since a scalplock has grown from the breast of the Turkey in honor
of that event.
