### 19. THE PYGMIES (28)

There is a race of little people to whom what is small seems large while
what is large seems small. A number of these people once said they were
going to war. They had bows about 6 inches long. The first enemy they
found was a hive of yellow jackets with which they began to fight. The
yellow jackets stung many of them to death, but there was one large
person among them, and he killed the yellow jackets by flailing them
with a bush containing many limbs. Therefore the little people became
very much attached to this man and honored him. While wandering about
they came to a very small creek, and in order to cross this they had to
build rafts. They killed a small bird called tsishtsinuk<sup>u</sup> and
cut it up into pieces, which they carried off separately. When the large
person took this bird by the bill and lifted it up they thought he was
very strong. When they came to a little creek he would take the little
people up in his hand and put them across, but a larger creek they would
jump, while the large person had to be taken by the arms and helped
over. Once they killed a bison, and one of these little men picked it up
alone and carried it along. By and by they came to where the long-billed
cranes live and fought with them. The cranes began to kill a great many,
but the large man got a club and clubbed them until they ran away.

(My informant did not remember any more of this story, but added that if
a man wants to see these little people he has to fast four days and go
with a shaman. The periods of fasting varied, the fast of a year spoken
of in Story 14 being the longest my informant had ever heard of.)
