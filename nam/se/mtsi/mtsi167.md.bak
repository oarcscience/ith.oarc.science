### 31. THE PYGMIES (28)

Some pygmy people and a human being went hunting together, killed some
small birds, brought them in, cooked and ate them. The next time they
went hunting they killed a skunk and the pygmies wanted to skin it on
the spot (being unable to carry it home), but the human being took it by
the feet and brought it back. After he had brought it in they threw it
on the fire, singed it, cooked it, and ate, but the pygmies ate a little
and stopped, while the man sat eating until it was gone.

Next time they hunted bear, and when they pursued it and killed it the
human being wanted to skin it but the pygmies seized it by the legs and
carried it home. After they had gotten to camp with it they threw it on
the fire to singe it, and then cooked it. When they ate the human being
ate a little and stopped, but the pygmies kept on eating until it was
all gone.

The next time they started off they came to a little creek which the
human being jumped across; but the pygmies did not know how to cross it.
Then the man hunted for a tree to make a foot log upon which all got
over. The next time they started out they came to a big river which the
human being did not know how to pass, but the pygmies jumped across,
tied some logs together and made a raft upon which they ferried him
over. Then they started on.
