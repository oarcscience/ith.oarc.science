### 11. THE DEER TABOOS (47)

A man out hunting saw some Deer and wanted to shoot them, but they said,
"Do not shoot us. Come here." So he went to them and they took him
along. They took him to their home, which was inside of the top of a
hill. Quantities of deer horns cut off and made into crowns lay about
there. He was fascinated by them and they put one on his head and he
went out with it. He wandered about eating acorns, and while he was
doing so the Indians killed him. After they had killed him they skinned
him and took his hide. He got back to the hill without his skin and they
spread another one over him. They put another set of horns upon his head
and he went out and started away. He wandered around eating acorns, and
while he was doing so they killed him again. When they skinned him it
seemed to him as if they were tickling him, so that he almost laughed.
Then he went back again without his skin and got home. They put another
set of horns, this time of a young deer, upon him and spread a hide all
over him and he started off. He went out and as he was walking about
they killed him as before. When he came back they spread another hide
over him and put the horns of a young deer upon his head. They said,
"You can run fast with this kind." He traveled about with these and at
daybreak they sent him back to his own people. He got home.

When he was about to start away, one of them said to him, "Human beings
do not kill me \[permanently\]. It is only the panther which wrestles
with me and kills me." He also said, "Bullets kill me. When I am dead
eat my flesh freely. Indians that can pass through trees (i. e.,
wizards) can kill me. Indian wizards who pass through and seem to walk
about on the other side of a mountain can kill me."
