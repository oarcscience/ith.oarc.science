### 18. THE TLĀNUWÂ <span id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_82) (27.md)

One time a young man said, "If I had children and those birds took one
of them I would kill them." People told him not to say such a thing, but
he persisted. This youth grew up and married in course of time and had a
child. One day, when the child was large enough to run about, it was
playing around while its mother swept the yard, the father being off
hunting. Then a tlānuwâ flew down and carried the child away. When the
father came home and his wife told him what had happened he did not seem
to be angry but said, "I am going to kill him." He lay down and fasted
for seven days. Hitherto people had always failed to shoot this bird,
because when they sent an arrow at it it caught the arrow in mid-air.
After the seven days fast was completed the man went to a, creek or
river near by, dived into it, and brought up a turtle. Taking this, he
went to the top of the precipitous cliff on which the bird's nest was
built, and, tying one end of a grapevine at the top, swung down to the
nest. He tied the turtle to the end of the grapevine and hung it in
front of the nest. Inside of the nest he found some young hawks
(tlānuwâs) which he killed and threw into the water. Then he hid himself
at the top of the cliff and waited for the return of the old birds. By
and by they came back carrying an infant with them, and finding that
something was wrong they flew round and round without alighting.

\[paragraph continues\] Then they flew high up into the air, let the
child they were carrying fall and beat it to pieces before it reached
the earth. After that they dived into the water and pulled out a snake
which they also carried high up in the air and treated as they had the
child, letting the pieces fall into the water. After that one tlānuwâ
flew up against the turtle, broke a wing upon it and fell into the
water, and after a while the second bird did the same thing. Then the
young man went down to the nest again, untied the turtle and carried it
back to the place from which he had obtained it. He went to the other
side of the river where the bank was low, made a canoe and pulled both
tlānuwâs out of the water. He pulled off their feathers, which were a
fathom long, and made a box for them. Afterwards some more tlānuwâs
came, but they were red in color. They lighted on a tree near by, and he
shot one and put its feathers into the box where he kept the others.
After that a great many people in his town began dying of a bloody flux.
He though to himself, "Those red feathers must be the cause of it." So
he took the red feathers out and threw them into the water, and the
disease was stopped. The person that saw these feathers was Watt Sam's
father's great-great-grandmother. It was somewhere in the east.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_82"></span>[246:1](mtsi283.htm#fr_83.md) Cherokee name for a
sharp-breasted hawk that was supposed to kill by striking with its
breast. My informant had forgotten the Natchez name. This is a very
large bird, and my informant's grandmother claimed to have seen its
feathers, which were "about a fathom" in length. It lived on a high
cliff above some body of water and used to catch children as a hawk does
chickens.
