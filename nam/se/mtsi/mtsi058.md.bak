### 56. TERRAPIN RACES (57)

(Tuggle collection)

Rabbit said to Terrapin, "Let us have a race." "All right," replied
Terrapin, "Let me get ready for it and let us race across a ridge."

"I can beat you," said Rabbit. "I can beat you," said Terrapin, and both
boasted of what they could do. Terrapin said that he would have a little
white feather in his head by which he could be recognized.

When he went away to get ready, Terrapin stationed another Terrapin
halfway up the hill, a second at the top, and a third in the valley
beyond, while he himself went to the starting place. Immediately after
they began racing Terrapin pulled the feather out of his head and turned
aside into the bushes. Rabbit, however, saw the Terrapin halfway up the
hill and kept on. This Terrapin disappeared in the same way and then
Rabbit saw the Terrapin at the top. But when he saw at the top of the
hill the Terrapin he supposed he was racing he gave it up and ran off
into the bushes.
