### 13. THE STORY OF AN ORPHAN (7)

An orphan was traveling along and other persons said, "Let us cross to
the other side of this big river." They took the orphan along. They went
together and reached the other side. They told him to

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

wander off \[hunting\] and when he did so they got into the boat and
went away, leaving him there. Then the orphan said, "Hold on, I want to
go too," but they left him and went away. Not knowing what to do, the
orphan traveled along by the river. He traveled, traveled, and presently
a Woodpecker came close to him singing. "Hī+yi', I will knock you down
and kill you," said the orphan. "Don't. I am making a noise because I
have something to tell you." "All right. Tell it to me!" he said and he
rubbed red paint on the Woodpecker's head. Then the latter said to him,
"Something big is pursuing you. Make many arrows. And as you travel
make, four wooden rollers, travel on, and sit at the end of a bent-over
tree. The big thing, Big Man-eater, will come there with some huge
dogs."

He got there with the dogs. Then the man was sitting up in the tree. And
he threw the rollers one by one far out on the water. Each time he did
so the dogs jumped in after it. When he threw in the fourth one, the
dogs did not want to go in after it. So Big Man-eater became angry and
killed all of his four big dogs. He took out a little clay pot which he
always carried in his pocket and made it large by snapping his fingers
against it. He set it down right at the very edge of the water, made a
fire, and put water into the pot. Then he put all of his dogs into it,
cooked them, and devoured them all. He put all of their bones into the
water, stood on the bank and called all of his dogs by name. One shook
himself and came out. All four did the same thing. He called to them and
started off and they disappeared.

Then the orphan climbed down, made many arrows, and traveled on. As he
was going along he shot and killed a bird. He killed a number of them
and roasted them. Then he took them with him and stood on the bank of
the river. He called, "My grandfather," upon which the turtle,
alligator, loggerhead turtle came out in succession. "Not you," he said.
After they had gone away the Horned Snake came out. "You are the one,"
he said. Then it came close to him and lay still on the water. It was
very pretty, having one blue and one red horn, and he sat upon them.
Then he threw a bird far off. The Snake shot forward, picked it up, and
ate it. When it was finished the orphan threw another far out. While he
was doing this he was sawing upon the horn with a strong rope he had. He
threw another far off and the Snake went on with him. Meanwhile he kept
sawing upon the horn. Now the Horned Snake said, "What are you doing to
my horn?" It gave him an itching feeling. "I am doing nothing," he
answered. "I like it and so I am patting it." He went on in this manner
until there were no more birds. Then he shot an arrow to a great
distance and the Snake went on rapidly with him. When he got to the
arrow he seized it by the ligaments used in fastening on the feathers
and swallowed it. When he was about to sink the man shot another. The
last one stuck into the ground close

to the water. At that time the horn was about cut through. Holding it,
he jumped and reached shore with the broken horn. The bank slid back
under him, but he kept on and got out. Then he started on.

When he had nearly reached the house where his sister lived he stuck up
an arrow at a spring by the road. Then his sister came for water and saw
the arrow. She said, "This looks like my brother's arrow. I think he is
not in this world and has been dead a long time." Then her brother, who
had hidden himself, stood up and said, "Hē+, I am not dead. I have
returned." He talked to her.

When he was on his travels they said to him, "Your sister has married
Owl. They have a little owl baby." So he said to his sister, "They say
you have married Owl." She answered, "I have married him. He whips me
all the time." At that her brother was very angry. He said, "When I
come, heat some water boiling hot on the fire. Call to Owl and when he
looks toward you throw the little owl into the water and run this way."

When he got there Owl was seated fixing an ax handle. Then the woman
called to Owl. When he looked toward her she threw the little owl into
the hot water and ran off. Owl ran toward her, holding his ax handle;
but, when they got near, her brother, who was hidden, stood up. His
sister went round and stood behind him. Owl came on, intending to hit
her, and suddenly saw her brother. He said, "O-oh, I was just playing
with you." But the brother shot him through with an arrow.
