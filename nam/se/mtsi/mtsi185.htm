<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">49. THE CAPTIVE ALABAMA</H3>
<P>The Choctaw captured an Alabama boy. They took him home with them and when he grew to manhood he helped them much in fighting the Alabama. He captured people and returned with them, so that they did not like him, and called a doctor in order to get him back. The doctor conjured for some time until finally they got him. Then they tied him to a tree and whipped him. An old woman came and brought switches with garters with which to whip him. When she stopped another paid for the privilege of whipping him. They piled weeds around him and set them on fire, but he did not die. Then they piled dried grass all about him, set fire to the tree to which he was tied, and danced and used their rattles. They used their gourd rattles and danced round and round. When it was nearly day they danced again until he died.</P>
