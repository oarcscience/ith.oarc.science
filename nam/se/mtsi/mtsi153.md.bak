### 17. THE ORPHAN (6)

An old woman was living with a poor orphan boy whose father and mother
were dead. One time he went into a canebrake and saw something there. He
came back and asked her about it. "That thing is a bear," she said.
"People kill it." Later on he said to her,

"What thing with a white and red tail is it which always walks around?"
and she answered, "It is a deer. That thing is killed." "Another thing
which has speckled wings walks around," he said, and she answered, "That
creature is killed." He said, "Something white with spots walks about,"
and she answered, "That sort of thing is not killed; it is a chicken."

By and by he started off, found where the chickens lived, and drove them
until he got them near the town. Then he came home and lay down,
covering himself with his blanket. She said to him, "Why do you not
drive in the chickens?" and he answered, "I have driven them in." "All
right; kill some birds and bring them in," she said. "Get your bow and
arrows, go out, and kill some redbirds and some jays." He killed them
and brought them back, and she picked off each feather and made a
headdress ornamented about with bird feathers. Then he put this on and
she gave him a flute she had made for him and sent him away. "Put on
your fine clothes and go close to the town blowing on your flute," she
said, so he started on with them.

When he got close to the town, blowing upon that flute, all of the jays
and redbirds cried out. While he was going along thus Rabbit met him
carrying some twisted cords. "I am going to tie up terrapin," he said.
"Let us dive into the water to hunt terrapin," he kept saying. "No
indeed," the youth answered. But Rabbit kept teasing him until he
consented. When they got to the water Rabbit said, "Let us take off our
clothes." The youth refused repeatedly, but Rabbit overcame him with his
importunities. So they took off their shirts and both dived into the
water. The orphan hunted about everywhere in the water for terrapin; but
Rabbit, as soon as he had dived, came out, took all of the clothes, and
carried them off. The orphan stayed in the water until he had tied up a
lot of terrapin and then he brought them out. He found that Rabbit had
carried off all of the clothes, leaving just one old shirt. He put this
on, took the terrapin, and went on.

On the way he climbed into a persimmon tree near by and stood there
eating the fruit. Some of the persimmons he mashed between his hands and
rubbed upon his shirt so that he became yellow all over. Then he got
down, took the terrapin, and started on. By and by he came to the house
of a certain woman with his terrapin and sat down near it; a young girl
came to the door and saw him. She said to her mother, "A person is
sitting down there," and her mother answered, "Talk to him. He may have
come to see you." So she talked to him. Then he gave his terrapin to
her, they cooked them and ate, and that night the youth and the girl
were married.

The house was an old one, but when it became dark it seemed to fall, and
when day came they awoke to find that it had become new. (Completed at
