### 80. COW AND DOG ARE DISCONTENTED

(Tuggle collection)

"I am unhappy" said the Cow to her Maker, "because I see the sow is more
fruitful than I am. Pray make me more fruitful."

God told her to go to a certain fine, garden full of vegetables, stay
there all night and return the next morning.

She went into the garden, but instead of sleeping she fed on the
vegetables all night and destroyed the beautiful garden, and when she
went to God in the morning he said to her: "See what destruction you
have caused in one night. Were I to grant your request, the world could
not furnish food for your progeny. Go and be contented."

The Dog came to God and said: "I am required to fight all kinds of
animals, but I am not provided with horns like the cow, or tusks like
the bog. I have only short teeth. Make my teeth long."

Then God said: "Go to yonder pile of skins and pass the night; come
again in the morning."

The Dog went. During the night he rose and injured the edges of all the
skins by gnawing them.

When he came on the morrow his Maker said to him, "Behold what your
short teeth have done in one night. Were I to make them longer, great
destruction would result."
