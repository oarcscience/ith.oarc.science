### 24. THE DEAD WIFE

A man and his wife were going along a trail when the man picked some
berries of the button-snake root and threw them gently at his wife who
was ahead of him. They passed through her body and she died. Then the
woman's relatives took her and buried her, and her husband with her,
although he was alive.

When night came she went to a dance. The next night she was gone again.
She came back covered with sweat. Then she said to her husband, "You
have nothing to do here but lie still and be sad. Get on my back." So he
got on her back, she jumped up and put him down outside, going through
the earth with him. And when

he reached his house and the people saw him, they said, "He has broken
through the earth." They set out for the place and when they got there
looked all about but nothing was disturbed.
