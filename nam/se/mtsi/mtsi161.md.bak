### 25. THE HUNTER AND His GHOSTLY VISITANTS

A man went hunting on horseback and was lost. After he had ridden around
vainly for some time night overtook him and he sat down. When day came
again he mounted his horse and wandered around for a long time without
seeing his camp. Finally night came and he sat down and lighted a fire.

Presently something just like a raccoon came close to him and remained
there. When it was again day he mounted and rode all about but could see
nothing of his camp and night again came. He sat down between the roots
of a tree. Not far off from the place he had reached was a large lake
and he heard something big come out of the water there. When it came
toward him, however, a horned owl-crawfish <span
id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md) called. It made a noise and he heard
footsteps close to him. In preparation for it he sat with his gun ready
to shoot. It did not reach him, however, and at daybreak he mounted his
horse and traveled about until night without seeing anything. Then he
again got down and leaned against a white oak, where he fell asleep.
Then something in the distance made a noise like human beings. They came
toward him and he thought they stood in front of him. He thought they
said to him, "Take the direction of your head." He awoke. He awoke
before day, mounted, and set out in the direction in which his head had
lain. Before he had traveled far he reached home. When he had almost
reached home his saddle girth nearly came loose, he had ridden so long,
but he went on without fixing it. He reached home, took his saddle off
and threw it on the ground, and when he had hung up a mosquito bar he
crept under it and lay down because he was ashamed. Some of the people
thought, "He is dead," Others had kept on hunting for him.
