### 38. THE MAN WHO TREATED A GHOST (24)

An old woman was living at a certain place with her grandson. One day
the boy said, "I am going out hunting and will come back. I will come
back in four days," he said, and he started off. He crossed a big river,
reached an immense thicket, and camped there. Then he heard someone
shouting, but instead of going toward the sound he remained where he was
until morning. In the morning he went on, killed a deer, and brought it
to his camp. By the time he had roasted all of the meat it was night and
he sat down and ate the roasted meat. He kept hearing a person's
footsteps, and presently some one came and sat down on the other side of
the camp fire. Then the hunter said, "Come and eat meat with me." "All
right," answered the other. So he ate. When he had finished, both sat
down. The ghost said, "Did you kill this sweet meat?" "I did," he
answered. While they were sitting there he gave him more meat, and he
went off with it. In a little while he came back. He gave him more,
which he also took away. As before, he soon came back. Then the man was
very much frightened. This kept on until almost daylight, when he sent
him very far off (after meat hung upon a tree?). He went and came back
quickly. That was done repeatedly until daylight came. Then he sent him
very far away. And the ghost went off. The man ran away. He ran straight
toward a river, but when he had almost reached it he heard the ghost
shouting behind him. At that the man ran to the water and turned around
and looked. When he saw the ghost following him the man dived into the
water. He went down with the current and came up far off. He looked back
and saw the ghost looking into the water right where he had dived. The
ghost wanted to seize the man and was

very sad because daylight had come. After remaining there for a time he
went back. Then the man came out of the water and returned to his camp.
When noon came he took fire with him and started directly toward the
place from which the ghost had come. And the man traveled about in
search of him. He peeped into an old hollow tree and saw his meat
disposed all around inside of it. Then he hunted for dry dead wood, put
it into the hole and set it afire. The ghost inside shouted, but his
shoutings died away. Then the man went back, but he was afraid and went
home. Arrived there, he related the experience to his grandmother and
she gave him medicine to quiet his fear. He was somewhat sick for a long
time, but finally he got well.
