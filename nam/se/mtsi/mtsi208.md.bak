### 8. THE SUBMARINE PEOPLE (14)

Men and women living under water once came out at night and traveled
about. They came to where there were land beings. They wanted some
watermelons belonging to these people, so they came out and traveled
about again looking for them. They came out every night and then went
back to the same place in the water.

When they told about this some of their people warned them not to eat
the food of human beings. They replied, "We will not; we only want to
travel." "If you eat food belonging to human beings, you will have to
remain among them," said the others.

But by and by a woman ate some peaches in this country and was obliged
to stay here. She sat down while the rest went away and left her. She
sat alone. When day came the people caught her.

\[paragraph continues\] She continued to live with them. And they said,
"Why is it that the dogs used to bark every night?" "It is because we
came here," she answered.
