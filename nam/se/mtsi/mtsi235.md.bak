### 35. THE OWL PERSECUTORS (37)

### (SECOND VERSION)

A man hunting by himself came to a big thicket and camped there. After
dark an old man wearing a long yellow shirt with spots on it and
carrying a walking stick came to him. He sat down on the other side of
the fire. After he had sat there for a while he went away. He said, "I
am going to see my camp and will come back again." He went off, got
another person, and brought him

back. After they had sat for a while they went away. Presently they
returned with two more. One came toward the man and sat down beside him.
After a while another did the same thing, and they seized the man and
whipped him. Then the man became angry, seized his gun and shot at them.
Creatures like owls ran away and disappeared.
