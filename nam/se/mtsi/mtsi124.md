### 31. RABBIT AND WILDCAT

Rabbit found Wildcat lying down almost dead with starvation and said to
him, "My friend, why are you lying here in this condition?" Wildcat
answered "I am lying here dying because I am starving." Then Rabbit
said, "If that is so there are bison drinking water in a near-by creek.
You can catch a yearling bison when he is drinking water and eat him."
And he added, "A big tree stands on the bank of the creek bending toward
it. Therefore, climb it and sit there, and when the bison come down to
drink you can jump on a yearling bison and seize it and you can eat it
there."

Just as he told him to do, Wildcat climbed the tree bending toward the
creek and sat down, and he saw the bison come down to drink water.
Rabbit sat near looking on. Then Wildcat saw many bison go down. Rabbit
sat at some distance and Wildcat waited in the tree. Presently he jumped
down on one of the animals and landed on its neck, but the bison threw
his head up and hurled Wildcat into the deepest water in the center of
the stream where it was whirling around. Wildcat tried to swim but the
current was very strong and held him for a considerable time. But at
last he got out and sat down. Rabbit watched him, almost dying of
laughter, and then went on his way.

This is the way it is told.
