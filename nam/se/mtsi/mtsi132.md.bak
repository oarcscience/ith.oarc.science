### 39. RABBIT AND THE OLD MAN <span id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md)

A man had two daughters whom Rabbit wanted. At that time the old man's
many hogs were disappearing and he did not know what caused it. Then
Rabbit shouted from a place near the house and the old man started out.
When he got there Rabbit sat holding a hog's tail, and Rabbit said, "You
have been saying 'My hogs are disappearing.' I found them going under
the ground, seized this one by the tail, and sat herewith it while I
called you." "Well, I will hold it while you go and bring a grubbing hoe
and shovel," he said to Rabbit. So Rabbit went to the house, and when he
got there he said to the old man's two daughters whom he wanted, "I have
come because your father told me rem habere cum ambabus and come back."
When he told the girls this, they said, "You might lie." When they said
this to Rabbit, he called out to that old man, "Did you say both?" Then
he answered back, "Yes, I said both," and Rabbit said, "You hear what he
says," so they agreed and rem habebat cum ambabus.

After he had gone off, that old man waited, holding the hog tail. After
he had sat there for a while he gave a hard pull and pulled it out,
because it was only fastened to the ground. He threw it away and came
back. When he got to the house Rabbit had left and when he asked for
him, they said, "He is gone. He said you told him rem habere cum
ambabus, and we said, 'You may be lying.'

\[paragraph continues\] He called out to you if you meant both and you
answered, 'Yes.' So rem habebat cum ambabus and went off." When they
told the old man that he was very angry. "I did not mean that. I told
him to get the grubbing hoe and shovel, and he came for them, and I
thought he meant those when I called back to him, 'I said both.' But
when he did not come while I was waiting for him I pulled hard and
pulled out the hog tail, which was just stuck to the ground, and I threw
it away and came back. If I see Rabbit I will knock him down and throw
him away," the old man said, he was so angry.

That is how it is told.
