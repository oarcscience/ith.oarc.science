### 15. HOW THE ALLIGATOR'S NOSE WAS BROKEN

(Tuggle collection)

"In the old days," said Fixco, the Seminole, "all the animals determined
upon a big ball play. The four-footed animals, with the Alligator for
their chief, challenged the fowls, with the Eagle at their head, for a
game. Sides were chosen, the poles put up, the ground measured off, and
the medicine men conjured the balls.

"The day came and they all met on the ground. The animals ran around
their poles, all painted and dressed up, while the birds flew and
screamed around their poles.

"At last the ball was tossed into the air and the game began. The
Alligator caught the ball as it came down and, grasping it in his teeth,
ran toward the poles. The birds in vain attempted to snatch it from him
and at last gave it up in utter despair. The Eagle, however, soared
aloft and circled in the air till almost out of sight, and then like an
arrow he swooped to the earth and struck the Alligator on the nose and
broke it. The Alligator's wife had run along with her old man and was
shouting at the top of her voice: 'Look at the little striped
alligator's daddy, just look at him,' while all the animals shouted in
triumph.

"But when the Eagle struck the Alligator all was changed. The
Alligator's teeth opened on the ball and the Turkey poked his head in

among the teeth, pulled it out, and ran to the poles of the birds and
threw the ball between them.

"The fowls won the game and ever since that time the Alligator has had a
sunken place on his nose where the Eagle broke it."
