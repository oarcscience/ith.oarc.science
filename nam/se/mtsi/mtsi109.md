### 16. THE HUNTER AND THE TIE-SNAKE (26)

A man went hunting one summer. He killed a deer and carried it along on
his back. On the way he got very hot and coming to a pond he went in
swimming. While he was sitting in the water he felt something against
his hip and looking down he saw something blue lying there. He tried to
get out of the water but the creature held him tight and he could do
nothing. It began to drag him in and he seized a thick bush, but in
vain. It kept on dragging him. It was carrying him toward a big pond.
But when he was very near it his body caught against a big drift of logs
and the creature left him and went into the water, while the man ran
off.
