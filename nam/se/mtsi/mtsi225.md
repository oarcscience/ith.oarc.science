### 25. THE MONSTER BLACK SNAKE (34)

A big black snake used to pursue men and kill them. Its cry was like
that of a stallion. After it had kept on chasing and killing men for
some time a man who could run well and was traveling about the country
said, "I will run away from it and kill it." "You can not do it," they
said. "I certainly can," he answered. While he was traveling along he
heard the snake coming up behind him and making a noise like a stallion
He heard it at a distance and ran away. And as he ran he zigzagged back
and forth. He kept on going in that way until, at the last turn, he came
to a tree upon the other side of which he had a gun. When the snake went
around the tree after this man he stopped and shot it in the ear so that
it fell dead. That is all.
