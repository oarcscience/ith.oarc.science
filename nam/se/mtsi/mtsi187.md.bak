### 51. TERRAPIN RACES (57)

Wolf and Terrapin disputed as to which could win a foot race. Wolf kept
saying, "I will beat you," but Terrapin answered, "You will not beat
me." "Very well, let us run across four high hills," he said. Terrapin
stuck white feathers upon his head and placed a terrapin upon every
hill.

When everything was ready one said, "All right," and they started at the
same time. Wolf ran on and. when he came to the top of one high hill a
terrapin shouted and ran down over the top of the next. He ran on, and,
when he got to the top of the next high hill a terrapin shouted and went
over it. So Wolf ran on again and when he stood upon the top of the next
hill a terrapin shouted and went down over the following one. He ran on
and, when he arrived at the top of the next hill, Terrapin crossed it
and sat down. When Wolf saw it he bit him to pieces. Then the ants
worked at him and put him together again.
