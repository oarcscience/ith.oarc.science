### 7. HOW THE WATER WAS LOST AND RECOVERED (13)

Some Indians were gambling and continued to gamble for some time. One
Indian kept the water and after he had wagered all of his things and
lost them he wagered the water. Then the water was won from him and shut
up, <span id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md) so that there was none to be
had. All creatures needed water badly and went about hunting for it, but
they could not find it. At the end of four days a Tososohka (a small
woodpecker) while traveling about heard it. He went and told the people
where the water was and all went and chopped to get it. Some men chopped
with sharp axes and some with dull ones. While they were doing so the
Tososohka chopped and cut through to it. Then it gushed out and all of
the creeks were full to overflowing. Upon this all of the animals were
very happy.
