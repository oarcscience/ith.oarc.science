### 91. THE MONKEY GIRL

(AN AFRICAN STORY)

(Tuggle collection)

An old woman lived with her grandson, who was a great hunter. They had a
field of corn which the raccoons and monkeys destroyed, and though the
young man killed a great many of them, the destruction went on. One day
two pretty girls came to see the old lady. She did not like them, but
the grandson fell in love with one of them and married her. When he went
out to hunt he would ask his wife to watch the corn for him, and every
day she went to the field. Strange to say, the corn disappeared faster
while she was watching than at other times. Then the youth's grandmother
told him to follow his wife and watch her closely when she went to the
field. He did do and saw her turn into a monkey and sing a song as
follows:

Dungo, dungo,  
Dar-mar-lee  
Co-dingo  
Dungo, dungo  
Dar-mar-lee  
Co-dingo  
Dungo-dingo  
Co-dingo dingo  
Dar-mar-lee  
Co-dingo.

While she was singing the monkeys came in troops and destroyed the corn.
The youth returned to his grandmother and told her what he had seen,
whereupon she told him to take his fiddle and play the tune and sing the
song, and when his wife returned to sing it to her.

On her return he said to her, "I know a fine song; listen," and he began
her song:

Dungo, dungo  
Dar-mar-lee  
Co-dingo.

Then she cried, raved, and twisted until she turned into a monkey and
ran away.
