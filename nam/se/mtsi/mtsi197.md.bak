### 61. MONEY-SPITTER (77)

There was a girl without father or mother living with her grandmother.
One day she started out; she started out after hogs. She carried with
her bread made of chaff because there was then no flour mill. As she was
traveling along she met two old women. "What have you?" said they.
"Chaff bread," she answered. "Do you want some?" "No; where are you
going?" She replied, "I am hunting for hogs." Then the old women said,
"We will find the hogs."

Then the girl started on toward home with them. While they were going
along one ran away. She chased it about. By and by she got tired and
coughed. When she got tired again, she coughed and spit up a nickel.
Then she drove the hogs along again, but presently the same hog again
ran off. When she got tired again from chasing it about she coughed
repeatedly. She threw up a dime. The same thing happened again and the
third time she coughed she coughed up a quarter of a dollar. Just as she
reached home she coughed again and coughed up quarters, dimes, and
nickels. She threw up a whole box full. When the white people saw that
money they liked what the girl coughed up and got it.

Another old woman's only daughter went to hunt hogs. She carried a sack
full of biscuits. On the way she met the two old women. "What have you?"
they said. "Biscuits," she answered, but she did not offer them any.
Then they said to her, "Where are you going?" "I am hunting for hogs."
Then the old women told her they would find the hogs for her. They went
out and brought them to her and she started off with them. While they
were on the way she coughed and threw up a frog. She drove the hogs
along again. Presently she coughed again and threw up another frog. This
happened many times. She got home and coughed continually and spit up
frogs until she fell sick and died.
