### 10. THUNDER

Thunder married a human being. <span id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_75.md) He
had a big frog covered up to keep his fire. When Thunder came back from
killing someone he hung up an arm, the head and the buttocks. As he went
along Thunder sang, "I am flying. I am flying. I am flying. Flying water
(i. e., rain) is my child. Flying water is my child. I am flying." He
was shooting, and what he used was lightning. If he stayed away all day,
the big frog went around the fire and sang "Gaditī'yaoc. He comes
flying. He comes flying. Flying water is his child. He comes flying. He
comes flying." Since Thunder stayed away all day he was worried lest his
wife should be carried off. "Nothing can hurt me myself," he said, "for
I am very brave," and he lay down.

But now the arm, the head, and the buttocks hanging up got angry, and
the arm sang, "Hånīgū'tsi hå'nigutsi itā'wawa ita'wawa' hānāgānī'"
(meaning unknown). The head also sang, "Dū'nuga' dunuga' dunugå'tsi
dunuga' ya'ox" (meaning unknown except that the last word signifies that
the head was whooping), and gritted its

teeth. The back also sang, "Tsetsē'tataginā'wiyo. Tsetsē'tataginā'wiyo."
When Thunder came back from killing people he took the cover off of the
fire and the big frog and said to the frog, "Throw them into the
ground." So the frog dragged the members away, dug a hole behind the
house, and buried them. In that way he had made mounds of earth. That is
what they always used to say.
