### 4. THE SWINGING GRAPEVINES (21)

People dwelt for a long time on one side of a body of water. They saw
that across from them was some good land and wanted to go there but did
not know how to reach it. Then Above-sitter hung two forks of a
grapevine (from the sky). They got into these and swung until they got
to the other side. When all were hanging in these and swung and were
about halfway one fork broke off and

fell into the water. The other fork reached the land on the other side.
Those who fell into the water turned into fish. And when the ones in the
water sang and danced those outside danced. When the fishes danced in
the water human beings loved to watch them. Coming there continually,
they listened to them sing and learned the song. They learned the fish
dance and the fish songs in that way.

Then the people who had lived there moved and established a village on a
hill where they tried to farm. When it was night they went off to dance.
Two orphan boys living there went to hunt deer by means of fire. They
started out and, while they were traveling around, saw something which
looked like a bear sitting near the water, and they shot at it
repeatedly. When they saw its feet, they found it had flippers with
which to swim, and they were afraid and went back. When they came to the
people who had been dancing and told them they did not believe them.

Next day they went to work, and while they were there sent a girl for
some water. She set out with a gourd but jumped into the ocean. Then her
mother ran out. She kept on running, jumped into the water, seized her
daughter and pulled her back a little, but something seemed to hold her
on both sides and she disappeared under the surface. When they fastened
canes end to end and extended them down into the water to the girl she
grasped them and they pulled her out.
