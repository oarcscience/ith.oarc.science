### 45. OPOSSUM AND SKUNK (48)

Opossum used to have a bushy tail. Skunk's tail was slender and bare,
and Opossum saw it and laughed at him. Traveling along behind him he
said, "Skunk's tail is ~~l~~ōfga; <span id="fr_62"></span>[2](#fn_62) my
tail is wåtålwåtål." <span id="fr_63"></span>[3](#fn_63) Then Skunk
became angry, but he did not know what he could do about it. After they
had traveled a considerable time he said, "I wish I could clip your
tail." So he hunted up his friend Cricket, and talked to him. "Opossum
called me '~~L~~ōfga tail.' When he is asleep go to him, cut his tail
off, and fix it on my tail. Then, when Opossum gets up we will laugh at
him." He did so. Since then Opossum has been so sad that he always keeps
his mouth open and drools.
