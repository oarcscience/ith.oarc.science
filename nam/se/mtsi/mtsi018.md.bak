### 16. STORY OF THE BAT (52)

(Tuggle collection)

The birds challenged the four-footed animals to a great ball play. It
was agreed that all creatures which had teeth should be on one side and
all those which had feathers should go on the other side with the birds.

The day was fixed and all the arrangements were made; the ground was
prepared, the poles erected, and the balls conjured by the medicine men.

When the animals came, all that had teeth went on one side and the birds
on the other. At last the Bat came. He went with the animals having
teeth, but they said:

"No, you have wings, you must go with the birds."

He went to the birds and they said: "No, you have teeth, you must go
with the animals." So they drove him away, saying "You are so little you
could do no good."

He went to the animals and begged that they would permit him to play
with them. They finally said, "You are too small to help us, but as you
have teeth we will let you remain on our side."

The play began and it soon appeared that the birds were winning, as they
could catch the ball in the air, where the four-footed animals could not
reach it. The Crane was the best player. The animals were in despair, as
none of them could fly. The little Bat now flew into the air and caught
the ball as the Crane was flapping slowly along. Again and again the Bat
caught the ball, and he won the game for the four-footed animals.

They agreed that though he was so small he should always be classed with
the animals having teeth.
