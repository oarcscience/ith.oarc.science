### 53. TERRAPIN AND THE WOLVES (49)

Some Wolves pursued a fawn, which ran until it came to where a Beaver
was chopping out a canoe. Without stopping it went into his anus. The
Wolves arrived and said, "Have you seen a fawn come this way?" "No
indeed," he answered. "What is that under your tail?" they said. He
replied "Ångatca'" (Perhaps a word in some

other language). "What is it?" they said. Then the fawn came out, made a
jump and lodged far up in the fork of a tree.

The Wolves stayed about not knowing how to get it down. Then they
thought, "Let Terrapin kill it." "Can you kill it?" they said. He aimed
at it and shot it down. Then they said, "Do you want any meat?" "No,
indeed," said Terrapin. "Do you want a ham? Do you want a shoulder? Do
you want a rib?" they said. "No indeed." "Do you want the head? Do you
want the back?" they said. But he answered, "I don't want them." Then
all of the Wolves got on the carcass and in a few minutes devoured it
completely.

When they were gone Terrapin got some blood, wrapped layer after layer
of leaves about it until it was one big roll of leaves as big as that
(indicating size with hands), put it on his back and went home. When he
got home to his wife with this, he said, "It is venison." His wife
untied it but saw nothing but leaves. "It is nothing," she said. "Go
farther in," he replied. When she again hunted she found only some
blood. "It is too little to cook and eat," she said. She seized it and
threw it into Terrapin's eyes. And that is how Terrapin's eyes came to
be red.
