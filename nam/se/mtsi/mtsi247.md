### 47. TADPOLE AND CRAWFISH

A Tadpole and a Crawfish traveling about met and began abusing each
other. The Crawfish called the other Tadpole-big-belly, and the Tadpole
called him Crawfish-small-legs. Then the Tadpole said, "It is because I
ate some watermelons raised by my grandmother," and the Crawfish said,
"I travel with small legs because my grandmother had my legs tied up."
They kept on abusing each other until they fought. Then a Snail who sat
looking ran to tell some one. As he was saying, "Crawfish and Tadpole
are fighting," he came out of his shell, and a crow picked him up and
flew off with him.
