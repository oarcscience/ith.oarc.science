### 32. THE BIG ROCK MAN

(Tuggle collection)

The people were engaged in a war. Whenever they were on the point of
winning the victory the Big Rock Man came to the rescue of their enemies
and saved them from defeat.

They called a council to devise measures to conquer the Big Rock Man,
but in vain. They could not hurt him. Their arrows bounded from his
body.

Then they consulted the Wise Rabbit.

"Shoot him in the ear," said the Wise Rabbit.

In the next fight they aimed their arrows at his ear and one struck him
in the ear and killed him.
