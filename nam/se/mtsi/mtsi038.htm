<P>A Terrapin went hunting and met a woman. She accused him of having slandered her. He denied it, but when they passed a hollow tree into which he thought he could crawl, he said: "Yes; I did it; I am the man."</P>
<P>He tried to crawl into the tree but his shot bag got caught and he stuck fast. The woman caught him and beat his back to pieces.</P>
<P>By and by the ants came and he said:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I will give you my blood,<BR>
I will give you my fat,<BR>
If you will help me mend my back.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>They consented and brought him some tar with which he mended his shell, but it was always in checks, and he never afterwards had any fat, nor any blood.</P>
