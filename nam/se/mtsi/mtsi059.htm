<P>The Deer and the Ground Terrapin ran a race. The Terrapin stationed a second Terrapin at the beginning of the course, and two more at intervals along the course, while he himself sat at the end. Each time the Deer called out to know if Terrapin was there a Terrapin answered, and so with the one at the end.</P>
