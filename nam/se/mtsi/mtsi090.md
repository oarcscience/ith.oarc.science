### 88. A BEAR DRIVE

(HUNTING STORY)

The grandfather of my informant told the following story. When his
people were still on the Washita they agreed to have a bear drive, so
they prepared "drifts" (fences) of brush and other stuff leading down to
the creek. Then they sent the young people and all their dogs up the
creek while the older men waited behind the fence. As the bears came on
down and encountered the brush they reared up on their hind legs and
were then shot down by the hunters from behind the screen. Guns were
going off and cubs squalling in every direction. My informant's
grandfather was about to shoot the biggest bear but could not get his
gun ready in time and another shot before him. But the bear ran off and
crossed the Washita to a big prairie at the other end of which was a
bluff, the dogs following. Finally they got him way out on the prairie
and after many shots finally killed him. He was a fine big one and
everyone claimed him. All were disputing over him. There was one man
very much behind the others who came running up to them late. They said
to him, "We are having a great dispute here." Finally all agreed to give
this last comer the hide, which was the most important thing. Then they
ceased their contentions and went home.
