### 49. THE CAPTIVE ALABAMA

The Choctaw captured an Alabama boy. They took him home with them and
when he grew to manhood he helped them much in fighting the Alabama. He
captured people and returned with them, so that they did not like him,
and called a doctor in order to get him back. The doctor conjured for
some time until finally they got him. Then they tied him to a tree and
whipped him. An old woman came and brought switches with garters with
which to whip him. When she stopped another paid for the privilege of
whipping him. They piled weeds around him and set them on fire, but he
did not die. Then they piled dried grass all about him, set fire to the
tree to which he was tied, and danced and used their rattles. They used
their gourd rattles and danced round and round. When it was nearly day
they danced again until he died.
