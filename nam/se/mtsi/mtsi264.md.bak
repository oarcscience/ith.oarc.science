### 64. THE FLIGHT TO THE TREE (76)

An old woman was living with her grandchild. One time she sent her after
water, so she took a bucket and set out for the pond. She drew some
water and set it down. While she was standing there an old bison came
down to the other side of the pond. He called to her

and she went over to him. When she got there they started off. "Shall we
not go down this way?" he said.

They did not know where the girl had gone. They did not know where to
hunt. All of the people assembled and wanted to find out about her but
could not. They said, "Whoever finds her shall have her along with a
trunk full of things," but no one knew about her. By and by an orphan
living among them said, "I will go hunting for her and perhaps will find
her." So they said to him, "All right. Go in search of her and bring her
in."

When they sent him off he made four arrows, two red and two white, and
took them along. He also took four hen's eggs. He went on and discovered
numbers of bison and the girl sitting in the midst of them. Then he
climbed a bent-over post-oak tree, and tried to put the bison to sleep.
But while the others slept an old bison did not sleep. He kept walking
around. After a while, however. he too lay down and slept.

Then the man got down and started toward them. He seized the girl, who
did not want to come, and carried her toward the bent tree, but, when he
was nearly there, the old bison awoke, and all of the others awoke and
pursued him. He reached the tree with the girl, climbed it, and placed
her where she was not too high from the ground while he stood a little
above her.

Then the bison came all around the tree underneath and nearly made it
fall by licking it with their tongues. 'The man, however, took a hen's
egg and dropped it down upon the ground, when the tree stood up just as
before. Again they licked it, and nearly made it fall. He took out and
dropped another hen's egg, making the tree stand up again. He kept doing
this until he had used all of the eggs.

After that he took a red arrow and shot it through a bison; it returned
to him. He took it and shot it through another and it kept coming back
until all were destroyed. But the old bison was left. He stamped hard
upon the ground, causing pine knots to fly "fåm" against the tree, but
the man took them and threw them back. After this had gone on for some
time the orphan took a red arrow and shot it through the bison and it
came back to him. Then the bison cried, staggered about, dropped down
and died. The woman also cried, and, jumping from the tree, fell upon
him, and felt about upon his body. The man got down and took out the
tongues of the bison, including that of the old bison. Then he said to
the woman, "Let us go," but she did not want to. Upon that he took off
all of her clothing and killed her. Then he started home. He arrived,
carrying all the things she had worn. Then the people heard about his
arrival and all gathered together. They directed that the trunk full of
things be given to him. They let him have all.
