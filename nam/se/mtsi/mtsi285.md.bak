### 20. THE FROG <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](mtsi286.htm#fn_83.md) THAT LOST HIS WIFE

A Frog living with his grandmother took a wife. He did nothing all day
but swim about in the river whooping and his grandmother kept saying to
him, "Your wife will be taken away from you." One day he went into the
river and swam about whooping all day long. His grandmother covered his
wife up in a mortar and was sitting down when people came in search of
the Frog's wife and said to the woman, "Where is she?" But she answered,
"I have not seen her." When she told them that, they hunted about until
they pushed over the mortar and disclosed her, and they caught her and
carried her away.

The grandmother sat there all the rest of that day saying,
"Warts-on-the-body's wife, his wife," and when the Frog came home she
said, "To-day they have carried off the woman just as I told you they
would." The Frog answered, "Wa, wa, wa, I am angry. Wa, wa, wa, give me
my leggings." She gave them to him; he put them on and said, "Give me my
garters." She gave them to him and he put them on. "Give me my belt," he
said, and she gave it to him and he put it on. Then the two started off.
Frog went on, went on in the direction in which the woman had been taken
following his grandmother. Following the people, they went leaping
along. Presently they came to a big square ground where people had
gathered and when these people saw them they said, "Why is that warty
Frog coming here?" So they caught him by the arm and threw him "plup"
into a gully. He fell down the hill, "bokts." They also caught his
grandmother by the arm and threw her "plup" in the same direction, and
"bokts," she fell near him. They lay there for a while, then came to
life, poked up their heads and went straight westward.
