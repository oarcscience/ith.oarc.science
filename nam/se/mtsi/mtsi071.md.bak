### 69. HOW RABBIT GOT THE WIDOW'S DAUGHTER

An old woman had a beautiful daughter with whom Rabbit was in love. So
he went to the old woman and asked to marry her. But the old woman made
excuses, saying that the girl was not old enough, did not understand
housework, etc. Rabbit thereupon went off and made a plan, which he
proceeded to carry out. He took a cane and made a hole in the back of
the fireplace so that the sound could come through the fire. Then one
night he got behind the fire and spoke through his cane, saying: "Anyone
who has a growing daughter and does not allow her to marry will surely
die, will surely die." Then the old woman was frightened and said to her
daughter: "Listen to this. When he comes back you had better marry him."
And so Rabbit got the girl.
