### 38. WHY THE OPOSSUM HAS NO HAIR ON HIS TAIL (49)

### (SECOND STORY)

(Tuggle collection)

The Raccoon met the Opossum, and the Opossum said: "How did you make
such pretty rings on your tail?"

The Raccoon replied: "I wrapped bark around my tail and stuck it into
the fire."

Then the Opossum got some bark, wrapped it around his tail, which then
had hair on it, and built a fire. He stuck his tail into the fire and
burned all of the hair off and ever since then opossums have had no hair
on their tails.
