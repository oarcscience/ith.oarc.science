### 5. THE ORIGIN OF CORN (4)

It is said that corn was obtained by one of the women of the Tåmålgi
clan. <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md) She had a number of neighbors
and friends, and when they came to her house she would dish some sofki
(a native dish made from corn) into an earthen bowl and they would drink
it. They found it delicious, but did not know where she got the stuff of
which to make it. Finally they noticed that she washed her feet in water
and rubbed them, whereupon what came from her feet was corn. She said to
them, "You may not like to eat from me in this way, so build a corncrib,
put me inside and fasten the door. Don't disturb me, but keep me there
for four days, and at the end of the fourth day you can let me out."
They did so, and while she was there they heard a great rumbling like
distant thunder, but they did not know what it meant. On the fourth day
they opened the door as directed and she came out. Then they found that
the crib was

well stocked with corn. There was corn for making bread, hard flint corn
for making sofki, and other kinds. She instructed them how to plant
grains of corn from what she had produced. They did so, the corn grow
and reproduced and they have had corn ever since. (Told by Jackson
Lewis.)
