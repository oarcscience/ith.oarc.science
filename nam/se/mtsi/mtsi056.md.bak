### 54. RABBIT FOOLS ALLIGATOR (70)

Rabbit went to a pond of water where Tie-snake lived and said: "I want
to tell you that Alligator might hurt you." When Tie-snake came out to
him he said: "Alligator said to me, 'If I come down to his place I will
tear him up.'" Said Tie-snake: "Let him show me." Then Rabbit went to
the pond where Alligator lived and said: "Mr. Tie-snake says he is going
to tear you up." "Let him show me," said Alligator. Then Rabbit arranged
to have the two animals pull against each other to see which was the
stronger; so he got a long vine and had Tie-snake take hold of one end
and Alligator of the other. They pulled against each other for a long
time, but neither was able to get any advantage, so they finally
concluded to call it off and become friends, and stay in the water
together, which they have done ever since. By and by Alligator
discovered that Rabbit had deceived him.

One time after this Rabbit came to Alligator and said: "Mr. Alligator,
you say you have never seen Trouble." "No." "Well, you go over to that
sage grass and lie down in it and you will see Trouble." So Alligator
went over there and lay down, and Rabbit Went away after telling him at
what time in the day Trouble would come. Then Rabbit went off and set
fire to the grass until he had Alligator entirely surrounded by it. By
and by the fire came to Alligator, who ran back and forth but was badly
burned. On account of this trick he put hounds on the trail of Rabbit,
who finally took refuge in a hollow tree in which Alligator shut him up
tight. Then he

went away to get an ax, leaving Owl on guard. After Alligator had gone
Rabbit said: "What are you doing?" "I am on guard." "Oh, I thought you
and I were friends. Do you use tobacco?" "Yes, but I have none." Then
Rabbit offered Owl some tobacco, but, when Owl came to get it, Rabbit
squirted tobacco juice into his eyes and ran away, and Alligator never
did get him.
