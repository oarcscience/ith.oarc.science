# KOASATI STORIES

### 1. THE ORDERING OF THE MONTHS AND SEASONS

All things were made at the same time. The earth, sun, moon--all
things--got ripe and were left to man. The creatures having assembled,
any who liked a certain month took it and ran off. They pursued but did
not catch him. He threw it down on the ground as he ran and it started a
new moon. If a variety of bird wanted a month, when it was put down, he
took it and ran off with it. When the months were all divided up, they
were left to the various creatures. When the Horse was brought forth he
said he would have grass to eat and they left it to him. Just so the
Bear said he would eat acorns to get fat and they were left to him. The
Birds said they wanted to eat insects which come out of the ground when
it is hot and they took them. Whatever month one made a gobbling noise
for he took. The Horse said, "I will pull heavy things for people." The
Cow said, "I am going to raise children for people." And the summer was
made. Winter, spring, and summer were made together. Winter said, "Man
is going to roast his leg around me." <span

"I will stay about and kiss the flowers." When summer was too hot and it
was not good to work, the luminaries changed places, the sun and moon.
The sun turned into the moon.
