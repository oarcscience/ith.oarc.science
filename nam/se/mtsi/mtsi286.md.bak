### 21. THE PANTHER AND THE CRANE

Panther and Crane laid a wager. Panther said to Crane, "Let us see who
can throw the farthest." "All right," Crane answered. They said, "Let us
throw a hammer across a stream." Panther threw first, and he got it
across, but when Crane stood ready to throw, he thought, "I can't get it
across." The two had agreed that whichever did not succeed in getting
the hammer across should be killed.

\[paragraph continues\] "If I do not get it across, he will kill me,"
thought Crane, and, as he stood there, he whistled. "Why are you
whistling?" said Panther. "My elder brother lives way up there where the
hammer is going to fall. I am whistling because when I throw this hammer
I want him to see it. He is a blacksmith and I think it will be useful
to him. That is why I am making a noise." "If that is so, don't throw
it. I have some use for it myself. I can't spare it. Let us try
something different. Let us see who can eat most of equal quantities of
food." They did so. But the Crane had a bag hung about his person and he
sat eating a little and putting more into the bag. Panther, however, did
not find it out and ate all, and when all was devoured they brought more
in. After they had eaten for a while longer Panther got more than enough
and fell down dead. So Crane beat Panther.
