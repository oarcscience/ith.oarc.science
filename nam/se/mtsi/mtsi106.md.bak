### 13. THE ALLIGATOR THAT STOLE A MAN

A man was out hunting and made a camp at night. He got a log and lay
down, using it as a pillow. While he was lying there an alligator crept
up to him and seized him. But when it was taking him off it carried him
through some thick bushes and he held on to them so firmly that it could
not get along well with him and laid him down. The man looked around to
see which way to go and when the alligator was some distance away he ran
off. Then he returned to his camp, brought in a log, wrapped a blanket
around it, laid it down and waited at, a little distance. He stood by a
tree holding his gun.

Now the [alligator](errata.htm#1.md) came back again and acted as before,
taking the log in its mouth. The man aimed at its mouth, and, when he
fired, it ran away. Then he went off and slept. In the morning he came
back. When he went to look for the alligator he came to a pond near
which was a nest. He saw the alligator lying bent over the nest dead.
