### 39. THE OWL AND THE HAWK (32)

### (SECOND VERSION)

A man went hunting and camped. While he was sitting by the fire a Hawk
and a Horned Owl came flying and lighted there. The Hawk stood between
the man's knees and the Horned Owl lighted on the other side of the
fire. "Throw that Hawk over to me," he said, and the other answered,
"Don't throw me over there." "But if you throw him over here to me you
shall see at night," said the Owl. "Don't throw me over there. He is
very bad. If you do not throw me over there you shall be a skillful
hunter," said the Hawk. The Horned Owl said, "Come, throw him down
here," and the other answered, "Don't throw me down there." While the
Owl was repeating the words "Throw him down here," day began to dawn,
and he looked around and saw it. He jumped up and flew off. While he was
on the way the Hawk followed him, caught him, and cut his head

off and threw it on the ground. Then he came flying back to camp, pulled
out the last short quill in his wing and threw it to the man. "By the
use of this you can kill anything," he said.
