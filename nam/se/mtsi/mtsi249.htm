<P>Sandhill Crane was traveling along and met Humming Bird and they talked together. Then Crane said, "I can beat you." And Humming Bird said, "O o+o, you can't do it." "Yes, I can beat you," said Crane. After they had disputed for some time Crane said, "All right, let us race," so Humming Bird went to Crane's place to race with him.

<P>ocean earlier on the fourth day shall have his home close by the water forever." "All right," said the other. Then they started. And Humming Bird disappeared far in the lead on rapid wing. Crane flew slowly along, but he did not stop. Humming Bird, however, stopped wherever he saw flowers and Crane passed him. But Humming Bird pursued him and passed him quickly. At night, however, Humming Bird slept and Crane did not sleep. He kept going on day and night. It went on like that until the fourth day. When Humming Bird was asleep that night the Crane's crying passed him. Then Humming Bird was scared. "Now he has beaten me," he thought. Then Humming Bird got up and, as soon as it was day, started on. Crane reached the water's edge and Humming Bird got there afterwards. So Crane had beaten him. Then Humming Bird said, "Well, you have beaten me. All you can do is to stay by the water and catch and eat things there. I, however, can go on licking flowers."</P>
