### 12. THE ORIGIN OF TOBACCO (15)

### (THIRD VERSION)

A man was courting a woman and they were seated on the ground at a
certain place. Some time afterwards the man came back to the spot and
saw a small weed growing up just where the woman had been sitting. He
went several times, until the weed got to be of some height. Now he
began to care for it. When it was

about a foot high he took off some leaves and smelt of them and they
smelt good to him, and others he would throw into the fire, finding the
odor they gave forth in burning very agreeable. He cultivated this plant
until it gave forth seed. Tobacco was gotten in this manner, and since
this man and woman were very happy when they were there and were very
peacefully inclined toward each other tobacco has ever since been used
in concluding peace and friendship among the Indian tribes. (Told by
Jackson Lewis.)
