### 21. THE GIANT ELK (46)

A man traveling along met a pygmy. An old man said, "Whoever first kills
a very big bad elk which pursues people in order to kill them will be
able to slay anything." The pygmy, the man, the Panther, and the
Wildcat, all four, sat down and waited. For four days all stayed there
looking for it. Then the elk made a noise. They heard something coming
toward them. Then all stood up prepared to shoot. The human being stood
in front, the pygmy next, the Panther

third, the Wildcat last. Then the big thing came on trumpeting. When
they saw it the Wildcat was very much scared. When the big creature got
very close the Wildcat was so scared that he said, "Oh, I want to
defecate," and he ran off. But the man who stood in front aimed at it
and the pygmy standing next aimed at it. Then the creature came out of
the woods. When it got near, the man tried to shoot it but could not.
Then the one who stood behind, the pygmy, shot. And when the elk began
to fall over, the Panther who was behind jumped upon it and threw it
down. Then the Wildcat came running, and when it died he jumped upon it
and chewed its throat. And the Wildcat said, "I was not through
defecating, but I stopped and ran back here." The pygmy got all kinds of
game because he had beaten the others.
