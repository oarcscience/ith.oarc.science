### 14. THE WICKED MOTHER-IN-LAW (8)

An old woman lived with her two daughters. They used to go in swimming
in the creek. One wore a red dress and one a blue dress, which they
removed while they were bathing. A young man reached the place, took the
dresses, and, climbing up to the top of a bent willow, sat there. After
the girls had been in the water for a while they came out and looked for
their dresses, but they were not there. While they were hunting about
one saw something red in the water and said, "Our dresses have been
blown into the water." Diving, they hunted about and tried to find them
in the water but could not. Then they looked up and saw the youth who
had taken them sitting with them in the tree. "Give me my dress," one
said, but he kept refusing them. After they hand asked him repeatedly
the man said, "By what kinship term will you call me?" "Our
grandfather," one said. "No!" he answered. "Our brother." "No!" "Our
uncle." "Nothing like that," he answered. "Our husband." "Yes," he
answered, and he came down and gave them their dresses, and they went
home,

But when they got home, their mother, who was a bad old woman, wanted
very much to kill him. So, while he was staying there, she

said, "I want something." He went outhunting and brought it in. She said
she wanted something else, which he also brought. "I want you to repair
the house for me," she said. "I have bark cord ready," he answered. He
set out. When he arrived at the place a horned snake tried to wrap
itself around him, but he cut it all to pieces. Then he brought more
bark cord and finished the house.

Then she spoke again, saying, "Let us race." "No indeed," he answered.
"Let us wrestle," she said. "No indeed." After she had urged him for
some time, he said, "Now at last I am angry," and he threw her down so
hard that she was hurt. Letting her lie there, he went away.
