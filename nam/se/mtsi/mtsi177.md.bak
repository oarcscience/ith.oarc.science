### 41. THE BLACK SNAKE (34)

Along black snake lived in a cave in the rocks. Whenever it scented a
man it trailed him and kept on until it had killed him.

It killed by wrapping itself around the man's body. One day when the sun
was shining a man saw it lying on the ground, and the snake pursued him.
The man ran on and came to a river, and there a big yellow frog bit the
snake and killed it.
