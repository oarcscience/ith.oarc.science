### 47. THE ALABAMA AND CHOCTAW WARS

The Alabama and Choctaw fought each other. For a long time people were
killed on each side and they took each other's scalps and ran off with
them. After they had fought this way for a time the Alabama were
victorious, not knowing how many scalps they had taken. Then they became
friends.

An Alabama would come at night to a person's house when they could not
see him. He would throw small leaves over his body so that he could not
be detected. Then no Choctaw went out of his house at night lest some
Alabama, looking like wood lying in the yard, should knock him down and
kill him and run off with his scalp. When the men living in the house
went hunting and a woman went out and bathed in the creek they killed
her. They scalped her. Sometimes when all of the men were in camp the
other tribe came, all the men being off hunting, and killed the women
and children. Then they ran sticks through them and placed them over the
fire. And the others, coming back, found their children roasted like
squirrels.
