### 37. THE MAN AND THE ALLIGATOR

People were in the habit of saying that the alligator could run fast,
but one man did not believe it. "He can not catch me," he said. "He can
catch you," they began telling him, but he did not believe it. "Well, go
and see," they said, so he got a gun and set out. When he got near the
water the alligator saw him and came running toward him. The man ran
away but it pursued him and almost caught him when he jumped over a log
and went on while the alligator had to pass around it. When it had
nearly caught him again, he jumped over another log and ran on as
before, while the alligator went around. It pursued him again and when
it had nearly caught him he reached a bent tree, one limb of which stood
up high, and climbed up on to it.

The alligator went by underneath hunting him and, not knowing where he
had gone, rambled back and forth. By and by he saw the man's gun and
bullet pouch which he had thrown down on the ground. He walked around
both of them and covered them with dirt and then left them. Then the man
got down, took up his gun and bullet

pouch and started off. When he reached home the people saw him coming
and he arrived white and scared looking. "Did you kill the alligator?"
they said. "No," he answered. And they said, "That man who did not
believe has seen for himself."
