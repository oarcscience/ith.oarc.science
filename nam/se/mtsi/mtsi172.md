### 36. THE ALLIGATOR BENEFACTOR (31)

### (SECOND VERSION)

A man was out hunting. By and by he saw an Alligator lying on the
ground. He was afraid and walked around it for a while but the Alligator
said, "Do not fear me. Take me on your back and throw me into the
water." The man said, "All right," and he took up the Alligator on his
back, carried him to the water and threw him in. The Alligator was
hungry so he dived into the water, went round and round, picked up some
fish and ate many of them. Then he stopped and said to the man, "Ask me
whatever you want and I will give it to you." The man asked for two
wives and said he wanted to be a good deer hunter.
