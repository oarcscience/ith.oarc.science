### 24. PIGEON HAWK BRINGS DOWN THE IRON (22)

A piece of iron hung high up over a trail, point downward, so that it
was dangerous to travel beneath. Then all of the creatures that travel
above on wings said they would try to break it off. They set about it. A
flying creature would start out, but he would fail to reach the, place,
and would turn back. All tried and failed. The buzzard sat ready to
doctor anyone who was hurt.

Presently, after all of the rest had finished, the Pigeon Hawk
(a~~l~~ana), flew up and came back toward it. He struck that iron and
broke it but was split in two. The iron and the fragments of the Hawk
were coming down. Before they reached the ground, however, they were
caught. The Buzzard pulled out his own feathers and down, patched the
Hawk up with them, and treated him until he got well. This is all.
