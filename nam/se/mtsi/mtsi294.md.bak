### 29. TURKEY AND WILDCAT

Wildcat was splitting rails when Turkey Gobbler came up. Wildcat was
about to shoot him when Turkey said, "Wait," and he came near. Then he
said, "You can pick my feathers off and I will go to the place where
your wife lives, let her kill and cook me, and when I am done you can
eat me when you get there." So he sat down on a log and Wildcat plucked
him. After he had plucked him, Turkey said, "I shall be cooked well
enough when you get home," and he started off.

When he got to Wildcat's house he said, "Your husband said to me, 'Let
me pluck you and then you may go to my home and my wife will pound up
cold flour for you and you can tread on her.'" Forthwith she pounded up
cold flour for him, he trod on her, shouldered the cold flour and went
off.

When Wildcat came home at noon he said, "Is that turkey done?" "No; when
he came here he said, 'Your husband said to me, "Let me pluck you, go to
my home, and my wife will pound up cold flour for you and you can tread
on her.'" I pounded up cold flour for him and he trod on me and went
off," she said.

Then Wildcat got a gun and said, "In which direction did he go?" He was
shown the way and followed, and before he had gone far be came upon many
turkeys walking around with the one he had plucked among them. Already
he had feathers stuck on him in different places. As he went about he
would throw cold meal into the mouths of the others and each of them
would give him a feather. He was sticking them on his body and soon the
one who was creeping upon him could not distinguish him from the rest.

While the one who was going to kill him was following, they discovered
him creeping up and ran away so fast that he could not catch them. He
set out for home unable to accomplish anything.
