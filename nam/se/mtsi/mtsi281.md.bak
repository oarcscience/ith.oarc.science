### 16. ADVENTURE WITH A TIE-SNAKE <span id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_80) (26.md)

A man out hunting came to a river and thought to himself, "I will go in
swimming." He did so and swam about for some time in the shallow water.
He saw a deeper place, however, where he was afraid to venture. By and
by a tie-snake came out of this place and tied him. When it wrapped
itself about him he became afraid that the snake would carry him into
the deep water hole, and he jumped about until he was out of the water.
There were many bushes about, and the hunter grasped at these to keep
himself from being carried away, but the snake pulled him off without
any trouble. When the man gave this up the snake started off with him up
to the level top country. Looking about, the man saw what he at first
thought was a level strip of prairie, but when they reached it it was
found to be a large lake. The snake carried him into this. It was at
first shallow, but it grew deeper and deeper, and finally the man was up
to his breast. At this point, however, he heard a noise behind them in
the direction from which they had come, and looking, he saw that it was
a big alligator. Then the tie-snake let goof him and sprang up into the
air with the alligator after him. The hunter was very tired and sat down
in the water. Up in the sky he could hear the noise of the two
creatures, and after a long time he saw them coming down and they dived
into the lake. Upon this he thought he would get out of the water, and
he did so, but his bruises pained him so much that he could scarcely
stand up. When he started off he had to procure a walking stick. Then he
returned to the place where he had gone in swimming, put on his clothes,
took his gun, and returned home. He declared that he would never hunt
any more "because he was too old."
