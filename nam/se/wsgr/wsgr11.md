### The Magnolia Babies

Look into the heart of one of the large magnolia flowers that grow like
white stars on trees in the woods. Inside is a little green-brown figure
that looks just like a baby wrapped in his colored blanket. This is how
the baby got in the magnolia.

Once some Indian babies were playing in the woods near a river. Across
the river was a small bear, and he wanted to join in their fun. The
babies saw him and waved their hands and laughed. The little bear stood
up on his hind legs and waved his paws and growled. It was only a funny
little growl but the Indian babies thought it was a big growl, and

away they ran for the nearest tree, which was a magnolia tree. The baby
bear thought they were running just for fun. Into the river he jumped.
When he reached the other bank he growled again and ran after the little
Indians.

Up the magnolia tree they climbed. Up climbed the little bear behind
them, because he wanted to play. But the Indian babies didn't know this.
Full of fear each one opened a bud of the magnolia flower and hid
himself inside the white petals. And there they all stayed.

This is why the magnolia has the little green-brown figure of a baby
wrapped in a blanket. He is wrapped so closely that you can't see his
eyes, because he is still afraid a little bear is around.
