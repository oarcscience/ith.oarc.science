### Chief Two Hawks' Trail

A great hunter named Two Hawks stood on a dry, hot plain at the edge of
his camp and looked far away across the dying bushes. Two Hawks was
looking for signs of wild animals which the hungry Indians of his tribe
could eat. But he could see none, he could see nothing but shining waves
of heat, called sun devils, dancing over the desert. All the animals had
gone because for many weeks there had been no rain in the land.
Everything was dry, the creeks had dried up, the springs had dried up.
Because there was no water the plants were dying, and because the plants
were dying, the

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

animals such as rabbits, the deer and the buffaloes, had fled away in
search of food and water.

Day after day the sun burned in the hard blue sky. Now Two Hawks' tribe
had become so weak from want of food that of all the men only Two Hawks
himself, who was the strongest of them all, could walk around. The chief
was looking across the land because he knew that he must soon leave the
camp alone to see if he could find something for his people to eat. Far
off he could see a mountain. He decided he would go toward that mountain
to see what he could find.

Two Hawks was strong and brave, but as he walked over the burning ground
where no grass grew he felt sick and

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

weak. The sun beat upon his head and made him dizzy, but he walked mile
after mile without stopping. Finally, after two days, Two Hawks came in
sight of a deep canyon near the mountain. Tired and thirsty, the chief
looked over the edge of the canyon. There, feeding on the grass that
grew near the edge of a little stream at the bottom, was a herd of
buffalo. Two Hawks' heart leaped with joy when he saw the animals.
Although he was weak from hunger the Indian began creeping down the side
of the canyon through the bushes. When he was close enough to the
buffaloes he put an arrow to his bow, but he was so weak that he could
hardly bend the bow. Finally he let the arrow fly. His aim was good, and
one of the

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

buffaloes kicked up a mighty cloud of dust and then fell to the ground.

Now there was food for the Indians! But when Two Hawks had skinned the
dead buffalo and started to carry off some of the meat he found he did
not have enough strength to carry it. What could he do? At last he
decided to hide the meat in a little cave he saw in the side of the
canyon. He would go back to the camp and return with some of the men.

As Two Hawks was putting the last of the meat into the cave, a large,
fierce wolf which had smelled the meat rushed into the cave. Two Hawks
did not see him, for he was bending over the meat. The wolf struck him
on the back and sank his sharp teeth into the chief's neck.

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

With the last of his strength Two Hawks turned and began fighting the
terrible animal with his bare hands. Finally he tore the wolf's teeth
from his neck. As he did so the blood flowed out and streamed into his
face, but Two Hawks did not care. He was going to kill this wolf. He
seized the animal's neck in his still strong hands and choked it until
the wolf lay still.

Two Hawks had won the battle. Yet when he got to his feet he almost fell
down, for he had lost much blood. But nothing would stop him from
getting back to his camp far over the plains. He must tell his people
where they could find the meat. He staggered out of the cave and at last
crawled back to the top of the canyon.

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

As Two Hawks went slowly back the deep cuts in his neck which the wolf
had made still bled. The blood ran down his body and fell in drops to
the hard, baked ground. As he went he became weaker and weaker. Finally
he knew he was going to die before he could return to the Indians. He
was glad that the drops of blood marked his trail, for he knew that if
the Indians found his body they could follow the blood back to the cave
where he had left the meat. But then Two Hawks saw that large red ants
had begun to follow him and were eating the drops as fast as they fell.

When he saw this Two Hawks fell upon his knees and prayed to the Great
Spirit to do something to keep the ants from

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

eating the signs that marked his trail. He prayed for a long time under
the hot sun, then got to his feet and tried to go on. When he had come
close to the camp he fell to the earth and died.

The Great Spirit was proud of the chief's bravery. Because Two Hawks had
done his best to help his people the Great Spirit leaned down from the
sky and rolled a little ball of earth around each drop of blood, so that
the big ants could not eat it. And so it happened that all along the
trail of Two Hawks were little brown balls of earth. A party of Indians
which had gone out to find their chief soon found his body. As they
sadly picked him up they saw all around him the little balls. They saw
them on the

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

ground where the chief had walked. When the Indians broke open one of
the balls they found the red blood inside, and then they knew that the
Great Spirit had done this as a message to them. After they had taken
the body of Two Hawks to camp they went back and followed the trail
until they came to the cave and found the meat which Two Hawks had
hidden for them.

When they brought the meat back to camp the Indians were so happy they
wanted the spirit of Two Hawks to know how much they thanked him. They
decided to gather the little balls and place them on his grave. But when
they looked they could not find them. Something had happened to them.

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

It was not long after that until the rains came. When the dry earth had
become moist once more, so that plants could grow in it, a new kind of
bush appeared along the old trail of Two Hawks. It had small, thick,
green leaves and sweet flowers that were purple-blue in color. As the
flowers dried up the bush became covered with green pods that became
hard, earth-colored balls, just like those little balls that covered the
blood of Two Hawks. And inside each ball was a red seed, like the red
blood of Two Hawks.

Today the seeds, which children make into bright red necklaces, are
called frijolitos.
