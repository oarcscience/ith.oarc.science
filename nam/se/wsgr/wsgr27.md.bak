### Paisano, Hater of the Rattlesnake

There is eternal war between Paisano and the rattlesnake. They are
deadly enemies, but it was not always so. Once Paisano, who is the
long-legged black and white bird called the road runner, or chaparral
cock, was the rattlesnake's friend. But the two friends at last came to
hate each other. This is the story of why they did.

The rattlesnake, like the great, highflying birds called the eagles,
carried messages from the gods to the wise men among the Indians. He was
given messages to carry because no animal dared to stop him on the way,
for his bite was very dangerous. He was called Serpent

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> With the Bells,
because he had rattles on the end of his tail. When he shook his rattles
and showed his sharp, poisonous fangs everything fled from his path,
leaving him to go on with his message.

Now Paisano, the chaparral cock, wanted to carry messages from the gods
also. With his long legs and his big feet he could run much faster than
the rattlesnake, and when he grew tired of running he would open his
black and white wings and fly a while. Paisano knew he could carry
messages more quickly than the rattlesnake. All he wanted was a chance
to show the gods how fast he was.

At last this chance came. Paisano was a curious bird, and he was always
slipping silently around in the bushes and among

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

the rocks. In this way he happened one day to hear the rattlesnake
getting a message from the Great Spirit. It was a message to the wise
man of an Indian tribe living far away. Paisano decided at once to carry
the message himself, to show the Great Spirit how fast he was. He set
out, running like the wind. Over the rocks and bushes he went, over the
rivers and through the woods. His long legs moved so fast they seemed to
twinkle. He ran till his tongue was hanging out, then he flew with a
great flutter of his wings, and then he ran again. Paisano was in a
hurry. Long before the rattlesnake had gone half the distance Paisano
reached the camp of the Indians where lived the wise man who

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

was to get the message of the Great Spirit.

Paisano gave him the message. He also told him how he had heard the
Great Spirit talking to the rattlesnake. He begged the wise man to ask
the Great Spirit to make him a message carrier because he ran so much
faster than the rattlesnake could go. The wise man promised to help him.

When the Great Spirit heard about Paisano he decided to use the bird as
a carrier of messages. But the Great Spirit did not like it because
Paisano had listened when he was talking to the rattlesnake. For this
reason he allowed Paisano to carry only little messages that didn't
matter much. Even this did not

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

please the snake. He was very angry with Paisano. He watched the nest
where Paisano had his little ones, and when the bird was gone he went to
it and swallowed all the little Paisanos. When the father bird learned
what had happened he rushed away through the bushes and looked for the
rattlesnake's little ones, and when he found them he ate them.

From that time began the war between Paisano, the chaparral cock, and
the rattlesnake. Paisano stopped making his nest on the ground so the
snake could not get his eggs and children. He began building his nest in
bushes or in trees. Often he puts it among the thorny leaves of the
cactus plant. Whenever

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

he goes to his nest to carry food to his mate he first looks carefully
around this way and that. He wants to be sure the rattlesnake isn't
following him home.
