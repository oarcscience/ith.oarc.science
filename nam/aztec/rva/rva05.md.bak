1\. Chimalipan was a virgin when she brought forth the adviser of
battles; Chimalipan was a virgin when she brought forth the adviser of
battles.

2\. On the Coatepec was her labor; on the mountain he ripened into age;
as he became a man truly the earth was shaken, even as he became a man.

### Notes.

The goddess Chimalipan is not mentioned by the authorities at my
command; but from the tenor of the hymn it is

{p. 32}

evident that the name is a synonym for the virgin mother of
Huitzilopochtli, who is distinctly referred to by his title *Yautloani*
(see ante, p. x8). In the myth, she dwelt upon the Coatepetl, the
Serpent Mountain, on the site of Tulan. For a full discussion of this
myth I refer to my inquiry, "*Were the Toltecs an Historic
Nationality?*" in *Proceedings of the Amer. Phil. Soc.* for Sept. 1887,
and *American Hero Myths*, chap. ii. (Phila., 1881).

The Gloss distinctly states that the mother of Huitzilopochtli is
referred to in the hymn. We must regard Chimalipan therefore as
identical with *Chimalman*, who, according to another myth dwelt in Tula
as a virgin, and was divinely impregnated by the descending spirit of
the All-father in the shape of a bunch of feathers.

In other myths she is mentioned as also the mother of the Huitznahua,
the enemies and the brothers of Huitzilopochtli, referred to in the
second of this collection of chants.
