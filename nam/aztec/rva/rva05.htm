<P>1. Chimalipan was a virgin when she brought forth the adviser of battles; Chimalipan was a virgin when she brought forth the adviser of battles.</P>
<P>2. On the Coatepec was her labor; on the mountain he ripened into age; as he became a man truly the earth was shaken, even as he became a man.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Notes.</H3>
<P>The goddess Chimalipan is not mentioned by the authorities at my command; but from the tenor of the hymn it is</P>
<P>{p. 32}</P>
<P>evident that the name is a synonym for the virgin mother of Huitzilopochtli, who is distinctly referred to by his title <I>Yautloani</I> (see ante, p. x8). In the myth, she dwelt upon the Coatepetl, the Serpent Mountain, on the site of Tulan. For a full discussion of this myth I refer to my inquiry, "<I>Were the Toltecs an Historic Nationality?</I>" in <I>Proceedings of the Amer. Phil. Soc.</I> for Sept. 1887, and <I>American Hero Myths</I>, chap. ii. (Phila., 1881).</P>
<P>The Gloss distinctly states that the mother of Huitzilopochtli is referred to in the hymn. We must regard Chimalipan therefore as identical with <I>Chimalman</I>, who, according to another myth dwelt in Tula as a virgin, and was divinely impregnated by the descending spirit of the All-father in the shape of a bunch of feathers.</P>
<P>In other myths she is mentioned as also the mother of the Huitznahua, the enemies and the brothers of Huitzilopochtli, referred to in the second of this collection of chants.</P></BODY>
