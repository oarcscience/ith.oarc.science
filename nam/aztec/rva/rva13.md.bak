### Notes.

Cihuacoatl was the mythical mother of the human race. Her name,
generally translated "serpent woman," should be rendered "woman of
twins" or "bearing twins," as the myth related that such was her
fertility that she always bore two children at one lying-in.
(Torquemada, *Monarquia Indiana*, Lib. VI., cap. 31.) She was also known
by the title *Tonan* or *Tonantzin*, "our mother," as in v. 5 and 6.
Still another of her appellations was *Quilaztli*, which is given her in
v. 1. (Comp. Sahagun, *Historia*, Lib. VI., cap. 27.) She was
essentially a goddess of fertility and reproduction. The name cihuacoatl
was also applied to one of the higher magistrates and war chiefs in the
Aztec army (Sahagun). Reference is made to this in v. 6. As a goddess of
venerable antiquity, she is spoken of as coming from Colhuacan, "the
place of the old men," or of the ancestors of the tribe. This name is
derived from *coloa*, to bend down, as an aged person, *colli*, an old
man. (See my *Ancient Nahuatl Poetry*, pp. 172-3.)
