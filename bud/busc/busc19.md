### BIRTH-STORY OF THE CITY WITH FOUR GATES

<span class="smallcaps">Four</span> of the five *gatis* or states of
re-birth (see Introd. [p. 20](busc03.htm#page_20).md) occur in the
following story: Mittavindaka, in his life as a man, and as inhabitant
of hell, the inhabitants of the ghost world in a mitigated state of
punishment, and the Bodhisatta, as king of the gods. The term translated
"hell" is sometimes called purgatory. It may be called either purgatory,
or hell with finite punishment, but there is no doubt that, apart from
the punishments not being eternal, such abodes as *Lohakumbhī*, the
burning cauldron, *Sanjīva*, where beings are cut to pieces and revived
to suffer the same punishment, correspond most closely with the popular
idea of the Christian hell.

The story was told by the Master for the exhortation of a brother who
refused to obey the monastic rules, and the teaching is emphasized by
Buddha explaining at the close that Mittavindaka was the disobedient
brother himself in a previous existence.

<span class="smallcaps">Long</span> ago, in the time of Buddha
Kassapa <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) of the ten powers <span
id="fr_9"></span>[2](#fn_9.md) there lived the son of a chief

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

of gild-merchants, who was worth eight hundred millions. His name was
Mittavindaka. His parents had entered the first stage of the Noble Path,
but he was vicious and unbelieving. After the death of his father, his
mother, who managed the household, said to him, "My son, the state of
man is hard for you to obtain; give alms, keep the commandments, perform
the fast-day vows, and hear the doctrine." He replied, "Mother, I have
no wish to give alms and so on; tell me nothing of that. I shall go
according to my karma." But, though he answered so, his mother, on a
certain fast-day of the full moon, said to him, "My son, to-day is set
apart as a great fast-day. Take upon yourself the vows to-day, go to the
monastery and hear the doctrine all night, and I will give you a
thousand pieces of money." "Very well," he replied, and through desire
for the money he took upon himself the vows, ate an early meal, went to
the monastery and passed the day there; but in order that not a word of
the doctrine should reach his ear, he lay down at night in one place and
fell asleep. Early next day he washed his mouth, and, returning home,
sat down.

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

And his mother thought, "To-day my son, after hearing the doctrine, will
come home early, bringing the elder who preached the doctrine," and she
got ready gruel, and food hard and soft, prepared a seat, waited for his
coming, and, seeing him returning alone, said, "My son, why have you not
brought the preacher?" "I don't want a preacher," he said. "Then drink
the gruel," she replied. "You promised me a thousand pieces," said he;
"give them to me now. I will drink it later." "Drink it, my son; you
shall have them afterwards." "I will drink it when I have got them." So
his mother set before him the bundle of a thousand pieces. He drank the
gruel, took the bundle, and, trading with the money, in no long time
gained two millions.

Then he thought that he would get a ship and trade. He did so, and said,
"Mother, I am going to do trade with this ship." But his mother replied,
"You are my only son; in this house there is plenty of wealth, and at
sea there are many dangers. Do not go." He replied, "But I will go; you
cannot stop me." She said, "My son, I will stop you," and took hold of
his hand. But he pushed her hand away, struck her, caused her to fall
down, shut her in, and went off by ship to sea.

The ship, on the seventh day, because of Mittavindaka, became immovable
in the deep. Lots

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

were cast <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) to find the unlucky
person, and three times the lot was found in Mittavindaka's hand. So
they gave him a raft, saying, "Let not many perish for the sake of this
one," and they put him in the sea. And at that very moment the ship sped
on swiftly over the ocean.

Alighting on the raft he reached a certain island. There in a crystal
palace he saw four female ghosts. For seven days they used to undergo
pain, and then for seven days pleasure. For seven days he experienced
with them divine bliss. Then, as they were going away for their
punishment, they said, "Master, on the seventh day we shall come back.
Until we come back do not be distressed, but stay here," and they
departed.

But he, being in the power of craving, embarked on his raft, and again
sailed over the sea, till he reached another island, and there found
eight female ghosts in a silver palace. In the same way, on another
island he found sixteen in a palace of jewels, and on another thirty-two
in a golden palace. And with them he experienced divine bliss. When the
time came for these also to undergo punishment, he went again over the
sea, and saw a city with four gates, surrounded by a wall. It was the
Ussada hell, a place where many inhabitants of hell undergo the
consequences of their deeds. But to Mittavindaka it

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

appeared as a city beautifully adorned. He thought, "I will enter this
city, and become king." On entering he saw a being burning in hell, and
supporting on his head a razor-wheel. But the razor-wheel on his head
seemed like a lotus. The fivefold fetters on his breast seemed like a
splendid breastplate, and the blood dripping from his body seemed like
red sandal-wood ointment. The sound of lamentation seemed like the sound
of sweet singing. Mittavindaka approached him, and said, "Fellow, you
have been wearing that lotus long enough, give it to me." "Friend, it is
no lotus, it is a razor-wheel." "You say that because you don't wish to
give it to me." The inhabitant of hell thought, "My past deeds \[karma\]
must be exhausted, he must have come for having struck his mother, as I
did. I will give him the razor-wheel." So he said, "Come, sir, take this
lotus." And with these words he threw the razor-wheel on Mittavindaka's
head, and it fell, crushing his skull. At that moment Mittavindaka
recognized the razor-wheel, and he cried out, "Take your razor-wheel,
take your razor-wheel." But the other disappeared.

Then the Bodhisatta with a great retinue passed through the Ussada hell,
and arrived at that place. Mittavindaka, on perceiving him, said to him,
"Master, king of the gods, this wheel has come down on my head, and is
grinding it small

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

like sesame seeds. What is the sin that I have done?" And he spoke two
verses:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Four gates this city do enclose,  
Of iron are the walls, firm-built.  
Here am I hindered and confined;  
What is the sin that I have done?

All the doors are shut and bolted,  
And like a bird am I caged in.  
What is the reason, goblin <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md), tell
me,  
Why am I smitten with this wheel?

</div>

Then the Bodhisatta, king of the gods, to explain the reason spoke six
verses:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A hundred thousand didst thou get,  
And in addition twenty more;  
When thy kinsfolk on thee had pity;  
Thou wouldst not to their words give ear

Thou wentest sailing o’er the sea,  
An ocean journey, hard to win.  
Then to the four thou didst arrive,  
And then the eight, and the sixteen.

And from them to the thirty-two.  
Then to the wheel, too greedy one,  
Thou tamest, driven by greed, and now  
The wheel revolves upon thy head.

The city, wide and hard to fill,  
Laden with greed thou didst approach.  
Who for this city seek in lust,  
They shall be bearers of the wheel.

</div>

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

They who will not forgo great wealth;  
They who the pathway will not seek,  
Who do not know that thus it is,  
They shall be bearers of the wheel.

Ponder thy deeds, and thy great wealth consider,  
Follow not greed, all vain and useless is it,  
And heed the words of those who would thee pity.  
If thou art such, the wheel shall not approach thee.

</div>

Mittavindaka, on hearing this, thought, "This son of the gods knows
exactly what I have done. He will also know how long I have to burn. I
will ask him," and he spoke the ninth verse:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">How long upon my head, goblin,  
This torturing wheel will it abide  
Tell me, how many thousand years?  
I ask thee, goblin, say to me.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Then the Great
Being in reply uttered the tenth verse:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Be thy torture short or lengthy,  
Mittavindaka, hear thou me:  
The wheel is thrown upon thy head,  
From hero thou canst not free thy life. <span
id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md)</span>

</div>

Saying this, the son of the gods went to his own place, and upon the
other one came great suffering. (Jat. No. 439.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_8"></span>[90:1](busc19.htm#fr_8.md) Previous to the
historical Buddha were twenty-four other Buddhas in previous ages, of
whom Kassapa was the twenty-fourth. They are of course quite
unhistorical.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[90:2](busc19.htm#fr_9) The ten powers (bala.md) of
a Buddha are knowledge of what is possible and impossible, knowledge of
the consequences of actions, knowledge of the different elements,
knowledge of the different dispositions of men, knowledge of the higher
<span id="page_91">p. 91</span> or lower mental powers of men, knowledge
of the path that leads to all the highest objects, knowledge of the
origin, disappearance, and corruption of the contemplations,
liberations, meditations, and attainments, knowledge of remembering
former existences, knowledge of divine sight, knowledge of the
destruction of the passions.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[93:1](busc19.htm#fr_10.md) Cf. Jonah i. 7.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[95:1](busc19.htm#fr_11.md) So Mittavindaka
addresses the Bodhisatta, as if he were a demon.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[96:1](busc19.htm#fr_12.md) *I.e.* he has to spend
a lifetime in hell according to his karma.
