### IV

### THE GREAT RENUNCIATION

<span class="small"><span class="smallcaps">Gotama</span>, at the ago of
sixteen, was married to his cousin, Yasodharā, who in the sacred texts
is usually called "the mother of Rāhula." After his enlightenment Gotama
returned to his native city, begging alms through the streets. His
father came and was converted. His wife remained in her room till Gotama
should come to her, saying, "If I am virtuous enough to merit this
honour, my husband will come himself to see me, and then I will salute
him respectfully." This he did, and his father told how since she had
heard that her husband was wearing yellow robes, and eating one meal a
day, she had done the same. His son Rāhula entered the Order.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">At</span> that time, on hearing that the mother
of Rāhula had borne a son, king Suddhodana sent the message, "Announce
the happy news to my son." The Bodhisatta, when he heard, said, "Rāhula
\[or, an impediment\] is born, a fetter is born." The king asked, "What
did my son say?" and on hearing the words, said, "Henceforth let the
name of my grandson be prince Rāhula." But the Bodhisatta mounted a
splendid chariot and entered the city with great honour and most
delightful majestic glory. At that

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

time a girl of the warrior caste named Kisāgotamī had gone to the top of
the palace, and beheld the beauty and glory of the Bodhisatta, as he
made a rightwise procession round the city; and, filled with joy and
delight, she made this solemn utterance:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Happy indeed that mother is,  
Happy indeed that father is,  
Happy indeed that wife is,  
Whose husband is such as he.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Bodhisatta, on
hearing it, thought, "Thus she spoke; on her seeing such a form a
mother's heart wins Nirvana, a father's heart wins Nirvana, a wife's
heart wins Nirvana. Now on what being extinguished <span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) does the heart attain Nirvana?" And with
aversion in his mind for the passions he thought, "When the fire of lust
is extinguished Nirvana is won; when the fire of hate, the fire of
delusion are extinguished, Nirvana is won; when pride, false views, and
all the passions and pains are extinguished Nirvana is won. She has
taught me a good lesson, for I am in search of Nirvana; even to-day
ought I to reject and leave a household life, and go forth from the
world to seek Nirvana. Let this be her teacher's fee." And taking from
his

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

neck a pearl necklace worth 100,000 pieces, he sent it to Kisāgotamī.
She was filled with delight, and thought, "Prince Siddhattha has fallen
in love with me, and has sent me a present." But the Bodhisatta with
great majestic glory entered his palace and lay down on the royal bed.

Now beautiful women, decked with all adornments, well trained in
dancing, singing, and so on, like celestial girls, took various musical
instruments, and came round him, diverting him with dancing, singing,
and music. The Bodhisatta, through his mind being averse to the
passions, took no pleasure in the dancing and music, and fell asleep for
a short time. The women thought, "He for whose sake we are dancing and
singing has fallen asleep; why do we now weary ourselves?" And taking
their instruments they strewed them about and lay down. Lamps of
perfumed oil were burning. The Bodhisatta, on waking up, sat
cross-legged upon the bed, and saw the women sleeping with their
instruments thrown about, some with phlegm trickling and their bodies
wet with spittle, some grinding their teeth, some snoring, some
muttering, some with open mouths, some with their dress fallen apart,
and repulsive parts disclosed. On seeing their disgraceful appearance he
was still more averse to pleasures. The hall, though adorned and
decorated like the palace of Sakka, seemed to him like a cemetery

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

filled with all sorts of corpses strewn about, and the three modes of
existence appeared like a house on fire. His solemn utterance broke
forth, "How oppressive it is, how afflicting it is!" and his thought
turned mightily to abandoning the world. Thinking, "To-day I must make
the great renunciation," he rose from his bed and went towards the door.
"Who is there?" he said. Channa, who had put his head on the threshold,
said, "Noble sir, it is I, Channa." "To-day I wish to make the great
renunciation; saddle me a horse." Channa replied, "Yes, your Highness,"
and taking the horse-trappings he went to the stable, and by the light
of scented oil-lamps he saw Kanthaka, the king of horses, standing in a
goodly stall beneath a jasmine-flowered canopy. "This is the one I must
saddle to-day," he said, and he saddled Kanthaka. The horse, as he was
being saddled, thought, "This is very tight harness; it is not like
harness used on other days in going for pleasure in the park. My noble
master must to-day be wishing to make the great renunciation." So with
delighted mind he gave a great neigh. The sound would have extended
through the whole city, but the gods suppressed the sound and allowed no
one to hear.

When the Bodhisatta had sent Channa, he thought, "Now I will go and see
my son," and rising from where he was sitting cross-legged

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

he went to the room of Rāhula's mother, and opened the door. At that
moment a scented oil-lamp was burning in the room. The mother of Rāhula
was sleeping on a bed strewn with jasmine and other flowers, and with
her hand on her son's head. The Bodhisatta put his foot on the threshold
and stood looking. "If I move the queen's hand and take my son, the
queen will awake. Thus there will be an obstacle to my going. When I
have become a Buddha I will come and see him." And he went down from the
palace.

\[With Channa riding behind him he passed through the city-gates, which
were opened by divine beings, and rode as far as the river Anomā. He
there crossed the river, cut off his hair, and sent Channa back with the
horse.\]

But the horse Kanthaka, who stood listening to the voice of the
Bodhisatta, as he deliberated with Channa, thought, "Now I shall never
see my master again." And when he passed out of sight, he was unable to
bear the grief, and his heart broke, and he died and was born again in
the heaven of the Thirty-three gods as a son of the gods named Kanthaka.

At first Channa had had one grief, but when Kanthaka died, he was
overcome by a second grief, and returned weeping and lamenting to the
city. (*Jāt. Introd.* I. 60 f.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1"></span>[33:1](busc07.htm#fr_1.md) The word is *nibbuta*. It
is the same word that is translated "happy" in the utterance of
Kisāgotamī. Gotama plays on the other meaning of the word, and makes her
saying an argument for renunciation.
