### DHANIYA THE HERDSMAN

<span class="small">The last two verses of the following are not an
original part of the poem. They occur independently in the Samyutta
Nikāya, iv. 1, 8, where they form one of the temptations of Māra.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Dhaniya</span>: I have boiled my rice, my
milking have dwelling,  
I ended, On the banks of the river Mahī, with equals  
Roofed is my house, my fire alight—  
Then if it be thy wish, now rain, O sky.

<span class="smallcaps">The Lord</span>: I am free from anger,
stubbornness have I ended,  
On the banks of the river Mahī for one night dwelling,  
Unroofed is my house, my fire <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md)
extinguished—  
Then if it be thy wish, now rain, O sky.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Dhan.</span>: Here are no gadflies found to
pester me,  
In the meadows deep in grass the cattle wander,  
They can bear the rain, when it shall come—  
Then if it be thy wish, now rain, O sky.

<span class="smallcaps">The Lord</span>: Firmly bound is my raft, and
well-constructed,  
To the farther shore I have crossed, and left the torrent,  
Now no longer I need a raft—  
Then if it be thy wish, now rain, O sky.

<span class="smallcaps">Dhan.</span>: Dutiful is my wife, not wanton is
she,  
Long with me she has lived, the charming one,  
Nought that is bad do I hear of her—  
Then if it be thy wish, now rain, O sky.

<span class="smallcaps">The Lord</span>: Dutiful is my mind, delivered
is it,  
Long has it been well-tamed, and duly practised,  
Nought that is bad is found in me—  
Then if it be thy wish, now rain, O sky.

<span class="smallcaps">Dhan.</span>: Self-gained is my livelihood and
my earnings,  
My children, healthy, are gathered round about me,  
Nought that is bad do I hear of them—  
Then if it be thy wish, now rain, O sky.

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The Lord</span>: Of no one whatsoe’er am I the
servant,  
With what I earn through all the world I wander,  
No need is there to me of wages—  
Then if it be thy wish, now rain, O sky.

<span class="smallcaps">Dhan.</span>: I have cows, and I have calves,  
Cows have I in calf, and cows for breeding,  
Also a bull have I, a lord of cattle—  
Then if it be thy wish, now rain, O sky.

<span class="smallcaps">The Lord</span>: No cows have I, no calves have
I,  
No cows in calf have I, nor cows for breeding,  
Nor even a bull is mine, a lord of cattle—  
Then if it be thy wish, now rain, O sky.

<span class="smallcaps">Dhan.</span>: The stakes are well rammed in, not
to be shaken,  
New are the ropes of munja-grass, well-twisted,  
Nor will the calves be able to break through them—  
Then if it be thy wish, now rain, O sky.

<span class="smallcaps">The Lord</span>: I as a bull have broken through
the fetters,  
Have crushed, as an elephant, the galucchi creeper,  
No more shall I the womb of existence enter—  
Then if it be thy wish, now rain, O sky.

Then at that moment burst a mighty storm-cloud,  
Filling the earth and deep expanse of ocean, <span

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

And hearing the raining of the sky,  
These words did Dhaniya the herdsman utter:

"Gain no wise small indeed is ours,  
Who see the Lord, endowed with eye of wisdom;  
To thee, O Lord, we come and seek a refuge,  
Be thou to us the Master, O great Muni.

"Dutiful is my wife, and so am I,  
May we lead in the Blessed One a holy life,  
And crossed to the farther shore of birth and death,  
So may we make an end of grief and pain."

\[<span class="smallcaps">Māra</span>: He who is rich in sons delights
in sons,  
So he in cows delights, who is rich in cows,  
For in the passions is the delight of man;  
He who is passionless finds no delight.

<span class="smallcaps">The Lord</span>: He who is rich in sons finds
grief in sons,  
So he in cows finds grief, who is rich in cows,  
For in the passions is the grief of man;  
He who is passionless is free from grief.\]  
                       (*Sutta-Nipāta*, I. 2.).

This is one of the parallels with the New Testament given by Fausböll,
and he compares the parable of the rich man who pulls down his barns and
builds greater, Luke xii. 16–21. The name Dhaniya means "wealthy."

Other parallels in the same work are in 7, 4, where Buddha is reproached
for not working. He replies: "I also, brahmin,

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

plough and sow, and, having sown, I eat. . . Faith is the seed, virtue
the rain, wisdom my yoke and plough, modesty the plough-pole, mind the
reins, watchfulness the ploughshare and goad. Strength is my ox; bearing
me to the calm of concentration \[yoga\] he goes without turning back,
whither having gone one does not grieve." Cf. John v. 17, "My Father
worketh even until now, and I work."

II\. 2, 4, 11, "The taking of life, killing, cutting, binding, stealing,
lying, fraud, and deception . this is impurity, but not the eating of
flesh. Neither the flesh of fish, nor fasting, nor the tonsure, matted
hair, dirt, or rough skins, nor even the many immortal penances in the
world, the hymns, oblations, sacrifices, and worship of the seasons,
purify a mortal who has not overcome his doubts." Cf. Matt. xv. 11, "Not
that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man."

III\. 7. "I am an unrivalled king of righteousness \[dhamma\]; with
righteousness I turn the wheel, a wheel that is irresistible." Cf. John.
xviii. 37, "Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king."

The Discourse on Exertion (III. 2) gives an account of the Temptation by
Māra (Matt. iv.). The story of the disciple walking on the water (Jāt.
No. 190, above, p. 76) may be compared with St. Peter in Matt. xiv. 28,
ff. In the story of the Great Renunciation (p. 32) the words of
Kisāgotamī find a parallel in the saying of the woman out of the
multitude, recorded in Luke xi. 27. During the festivities at Gotama's
birth an ascetic Asita or Kāla-Devala, like Simeon in Luke ii., does
homage to the infant, and weeps because he will not live to see him as
Buddha.

A curious Buddhist phrase occurs in the Epistle of St. James iii. 6,
"the wheel of birth" (R.V. margin), which is practically identical with
the Sanskrit name *bhavacakra* for the Chain of Causation, p. 37. Dr.
Carus says, "The reappearance of this peculiarly Buddhistic term in the
New Testament is certainly most startling and perplexing." But the
tendency now is to consider the idea that Christianity owes anything in
its origin to Buddhism as quite illusory.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_18"></span>[104:1](busc22.htm#fr_18.md) *I.e.* the fire of
lusts. The same thought occurs in the solemn utterance (udāna) of Buddha
at his enlightenment:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Through the numberless round of births  
All fruitlessly my course has been,  
Seeking the builder of the house \[*i.e.* the body\]—  
Birth again and again is pain.

Housebuilder, I behold thee now,  
Again a house thou shalt not build;  
Demolished are thy rafters all,  
Thy ridge pole also is destroyed.  
Free from birth's elements, my mind  
Destruction of desires has reached.  
(Dhammapada, 153, 154.)

<span id="fn_19"></span>[106:1](busc22.htm#fr_19.md) Victor Henry takes it
to be understood that the wealth of Dhaniya is destroyed in the storm.
