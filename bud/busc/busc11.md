### VIII

### THE TEN COMMANDMENTS

<span class="small"><span class="smallcaps">The</span> first five of
these commandments—not to take life, not to steal, not to commit
unchastity, not to tell lies, not to drink intoxicants—are binding on
all laymen. The whole ten are binding on the brotherhood, and in their
case the third rule means absolute celibacy. But the pious layman may
take upon himself three more in addition to the first five. Those
three—not eating after noon, not witnessing dancing, shows, and plays,
not using ornaments, scents, and unguents—are usually taken on the
fast-days, and are only binding for the day on which they are assumed.
Details as to the rules and organization of the Order will be found in
*The Way of the Buddha* of Mr. H. Baynes in the same series as the
present volume.</span>

1\. <span class="smallcaps">Abstinence</span> from destroying life.

3\. Abstinence from unchastity.
