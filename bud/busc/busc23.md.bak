### BUDDHA'S VISIT TO CHUNDA

<span class="small"><span class="smallcaps">The</span> two following
passages are from the Sutta of the Great Decease, an account of the last
few months of the life of Buddha. The food which Buddha ate at the meal
provided by Chunda has been stated to have been pork. For this there is
no foundation. Prof. Monier Williams, who was animated by a strong
missionary spirit, even asserted that "the story is that Gautama died
from eating too much pork." The word which is used is not *sūkaramamsa*,
the word used for pork, but *sūkaramaddava*, which literally means
"boar's soft \[food\]," and to call it pork is merely a bad guess. It is
generally agreed now by scholars (*e.g.* K. E. Neumann, Prof. Rhys
Davids) that it was truffle, *Tuber indicum*, which still grows on the
slopes of the Himalayas, and is eaten by boars.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Lord, after staying at Bhoganagara as
long as he wished, said to the elder Ānanda, "Come, Ānanda, we will go
to Pāvā." "Yes, reverend sir," the elder Ānanda replied. Then the Lord,
with a great retinue of brethren, proceeded to Pāvā. There the Lord
dwelt at Pāvā in the mango-grove of Chunda, who was of a family of
smiths. Now Chunda the smith heard that the Lord had arrived at Pāvā,
and was dwelling in his mango-grove. So Chunda the smith approached

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

the Lord, and, having approached, he saluted the Lord, and sat down on
one side. As he sat on one side the Lord instructed, aroused, incited,
and gladdened him with a discourse on the doctrine. Then Chunda the
smith, instructed, aroused, incited, and gladdened by the discourse on
the doctrine, said to the Lord, "Let the reverend Lord accept food from
me to-morrow with the retinue of brethren." By his silence the Lord
assented. So Chunda the smith, perceiving the assent of the Lord, arose
from his seat, saluted the Lord, and, passing round him to the right,
went away.

The next day Chunda the smith caused to be prepared in his house
excellent food, hard and soft, and much truffle, and caused it to be
announced to the Lord, "It is time, reverend sir; the meal is ready." So
the Lord, in the morning, dressed himself, took his bowl and robe, and
with the retinue of brethren went to the abode of Chunda the smith. On
arriving he sat on the appointed seat, and said to Chunda the smith,
"Serve me, Chunda, with the truffles that are prepared, and serve the
retinue of brethren with the other hard and soft food prepared." "Yes,
reverend sir," assented Chunda the smith, and served the Lord with the
truffles prepared, and the retinue of brethren with the other hard and
soft food. Then the Lord said to Chunda the smith, "The truffles that
remain,

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Chunda, bury in a
pit. I see no one in the world of gods and men, of Māra, of Brahma, or
among ascetics and brahmins, gods and men, by whom it could be eaten and
properly digested, except by the Tathāgata." "Yes, reverend sir,"
assented Chunda, and, burying the remaining truffles in a pit, he
approached the Lord, and, having approached, he saluted the Lord and sat
down on one side. As he sat on one side, the Lord instructed, aroused,
incited, and gladdened him with a discourse on the doctrine, and then
arose from his seat and departed.

Then there arose in the Lord, after he had eaten the food of Chunda the
smith, sharp pain and dysentery, and violent mortal pains set in.
Conscious and self-possessed the Lord endured them without anxiety, and
said to the elder Ānanda, "Come, Ānanda, let us go to Kusinārā." "Yes,
reverend sir," the elder Ānanda assented. (*Mahāparinibbāna S.* IV.)
