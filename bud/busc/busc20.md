### THE PIG-FACED GHOST

<span class="smallcaps">This</span> story was told while the Master was
dwelling at Kalandakanivāpa in the Bamboo Grove near Savatthi about a
certain pig-faced ghost. Long ago, in the time of the teaching of the
Lord Buddha Kassapa, there was a brother who was self-controlled in
body, but uncontrolled in speech, and who used to revile and abuse the
brethren. When he died, he was reborn in hell. During the time
intervening between the appearance of another Buddha he continued to
burn there, and being reborn from thence in the period of this Buddha's
appearance, through the ripening of his karma he came to life as a ghost
at the foot of the Vulture Peak near Rājagaha, being tormented by hunger
and thirst. His body was golden in colour, and his face like a pig's
face.

Now the elder Nārada dwelt on the Vulture Peak, and early in the
morning, after attending to his bodily needs, took his bowl and robe and
went to Rājagaha, wandering about for alms. On the way he saw the ghost,
and,

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

asking him what he had done <span id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md) spoke
this verse:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">All golden does thy body seem,  
In all directions does it shine;  
But yet thy face is as a pig's,  
What former action hast thou done?</span>

</div>

The ghost, thus asked by the elder what he had done, explained in a
verse:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">With body self-controlled was I,  
Yet was I uncontrolled in speech;  
Therefore in colour am I so  
As thou beholdest, Nārada.</span>

</div>

So the ghost, being asked by the elder, explained the matter, and gave
the reason; and, exhorting the elder, spoke this verse:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">This to thee, Nārada, I tell,  
Thou hast thyself my fate beheld:  
Commit no evil with thy mouth,  
Become not thou a pig-faced ghost.</span>

</div>

Then the elder Nārada went for alms, and, returning in the afternoon
with his food, related the matter, while the Master sat in the midst of
the fourfold assembly. <span id="fr_14"></span>[2](#fn_14.md) The Master
said, "Even before now I have seen this being." And he declared the
doctrine, explaining the manifold worthlessness and evil results due to
misbehaviour in speech, and the blessings resulting from right speech.
And his teaching was beneficial to the assembly present. (*Peta-vatthu,
Comm.*)
