### XXIII

### NON-INDIVIDUALITY AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> king said, "Reverend Nāgasena, what
is reborn?" The elder replied, "Mind and body \[name and form\], O king,
are re-born." "Is it just this mind and body that is re-born?" "Not just
this mind and body, O king, but with this mind and body a man does deeds
\[karma\], either good or evil, and through these deeds another mind and
body is re-born." "If, reverend sir, it is not just this mind and body
that is re-born, surely he will be liberated from his evil deeds?" The
elder replied, "If he were not re-born, he would be liberated from his
evil deeds, but just because he is re-born he is not liberated from his
evil deeds."

"Give me an example." "Just as if, O king, a man were to steal a mango
from another man, and the owner of the mango were to take him and bring
him before the king, saying, 'Your majesty, my mangoes have been stolen
by this man'; and the thief were to reply, 'Your majesty, I did not take
his mangoes. The mangoes that he planted are not the same as those I
stole. I am not liable to punishment.'

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Now would the man,
O king, be liable to punishment?" "Yes, reverend sir, he would." "Why?"
"Whatever he might say, he could not deny the first mango, and he would
be liable to punishment for the last." "Even so, O king, through this
mind and body a man does good or evil deeds, and through those deeds
another mind and body is re-born. Hence he is not liberated from his
evil deeds. . . ."

"Give me a further example." "Just as if, O king, a man were to buy a
pot of milk from a cowherd, and were to leave it in his charge and go
away, saying, 'I will come and take it tomorrow'; and he were to come
the next day, when it had turned to curds, and say, 'Give me my pot of
milk,' and he should give him the curds, and the other were to say, 'I
did not buy curds from you; give me my pot of milk.' The other would
reply 'Without your knowing it, the milk has turned to curds.' If they
came disputing before you, in whose favour would you decide?" "In favour
of the cowherd, reverend sir." "Why?" "Because, whatever he might say,
nevertheless it is just from the milk that the curds are derived." "Even
so, O king, through this mind and body a man does good or evil deeds,
and through those deeds another mind and body is re-born. Hence he is
not liberated from his evil deeds." "You are a clever man, Nāgasena."
