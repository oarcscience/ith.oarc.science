### THE DREAM OF QUEEN MĀYĀ

<span class="smallcaps">Gotama</span>, the future Buddha, was born about
567 B.C. as the son of the Raja of the tribe of Sakyas, at Kapilavatthu
on the borders of Nepal, and about 130 miles north of Benares. This date
is only a calculation made by reckoning back from the dates of the
reigns of various kings, but there is a general agreement that it is
approximately correct.

The story of Queen Māyā's dream, as well as the three following
passages, are from the introduction to the Jātakas, which contains an
account of Gotama's early life. The *Lalita Vistara*, the later Sanskrit
account, shows the development of the legend. The event of the dream is
there recorded as an actual occurrence, in which the Bodhisatta descends
from the Tusita heaven in the form of an elephant. In the earlier legend
there is no mention of a virgin birth, but in the later story the queen
takes a vow of abstinence, to which the king gives his consent.

<span class="smallcaps">Then</span> was proclaimed in the city of
Kapilavatthu the midsummer festival of the month Āsālha, and many people
celebrated the festivities. The queen Mahāmāyā, beginning from the seven
days before the full moon, celebrated the festival with the splendour of
garlands and perfumes, and without the drinking of intoxicants. On the
seventh day she rose early, bathed in scented

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

water, bestowed a great gift of 400,000 pieces of money as alms, being
adorned with all kinds of ornaments, ate of choice food, performed the
holy-day vows, and entered the splendidly adorned royal bedchamber, And
lying on the royal bed she fell asleep, and dreamt this dream: The four
kings <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) raised her together with the
bed, and took her to the Himalaya to the Manosilā tableland, sixty
leagues in length, and placing her beneath a great sal-tree, seven
leagues high, they stood on one side.

Then their queens took the queen to the lake Anotattā, bathed her to
remove human stain, robed her in a divine dress, anointed her with
perfumes, and decked her with divine flowers. Not far from there is
Silver mountain, and on it a golden palace. There they prepared and set
a divine bed with its head to the east. Then the Bodhisatta became a
white elephant. Not far from there is a certain Golden mountain, and the
Bodhisatta went there, descended from it, ascended Silver mountain,
approaching it from the north, and in his trunk, like a silver chain, he
bore a white lotus. He trumpeted, entered the golden palace, made a
rightwise circle three times round his mother's bed, smote her right
side, and seemed to enter her womb. Thus at the end of the midsummer
festival he received a new existence.

The next day, on awaking, the queen told her dream to the king. The king
summoned sixty-four famous brahmins, caused the ground to be strewn with
festive lāja-flowers, prepared splendid seats, filled the gold and
silver bowls of the brahmins seated there with cooked ghee, honey,
sugar, and excellent rice, and gave it to them covered with gold and
silver covers. He also delighted them with other gifts, such as new
clothes and tawny cows. Then, when they were delighted with all these
pleasures, he related the dream. "What will take place?" he asked. The
brahmins said, "King, be not anxious, the queen has conceived, and the
child will be a male, not a female. You will have a son, and if he lives
a household life, he will become a universal monarch; and if he leaves
his house and goes forth from the world, he will become a Buddha, a
dispeller of illusion in the world. (*Jāt. Introd*, I. 50 ff.)
