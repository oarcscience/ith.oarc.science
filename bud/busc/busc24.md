### XXI

### THE DEATH OF BUDDHA

<span class="small"><span class="smallcaps">Kusinārā</span> (now Kasia),
to which Buddha journeyed after recovering from his sickness, was in the
Mallian country, about 140 miles east of Sāvatthi; and it was there
where he gave his last instructions and passed away. In the stages of
mystic ecstasy described below, the first four are called jhānas, or
mystic meditations. These are the four lower stages, in which the person
meditating is still distinct from the object. They will be found
described in Rhys Davids’ *Buddhism*, p. 175. The four higher stages, in
which the thinker and object are identified, are called attainments, but
there are really eight attainments corresponding to the eight degrees.
These eight stages correspond to the higher divisions of the universe.
The universe consists of three great divisions, kāmāvacara, the domain
of sensual desire, rūpāvacara, the world of form in four degrees,
corresponding to the four degrees of jhāna, and the formless world, to
which correspond the four higher degrees of ecstasy.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Then</span> the Lord said to the elder Ānanda,
"It may be, Ānanda, that you may think, 'Passed away is the utterance of
the Master, we have a Master no more.' Not so, Ānanda, is it to be so
regarded. The doctrine and discipline which have been taught and laid
down by me is the

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Master after my
departure. And as now, Ānanda, the brethren address one another as
'friend' \[*āvuso*\], after my departure they are not so to address
them. An elder brother is to address a younger brother by his name, or
family name, or the term 'friend,' and a younger brother is to address
an elder brother as 'reverend sir' \[*bhante*\], or 'elder'
\[*āyasmā*\]. Let the assembly, Ānanda, if it so wish, after my death,
abolish some commands of minor importance. On Channa, Ānanda, after my
departure the brahma-punishment is to be imposed." "What, reverend sir,
is the brahma-punishment?" "The brother Channa, Ānanda, may say what he
wishes, he is not to be addressed by the brethren, nor admonished, nor
instructed."

Then the Lord addressed the brethren, "It may be, that even a single
brother may be in doubt or uncertainty about the Buddha or the doctrine
or the path or the course of conduct. Ask, brethren; do not with regret
say afterwards, 'The Master was face to face with us, and we could not
ask the Lord face to face.'" At these words the brethren were silent.
\[A second time and a third time the Lord thus addressed the brethren.\]
And even a third time the brethren were silent. Then the Lord addressed
the brethren, "It may be, brethren, that you do not ask out of reverence
for the Master; let a friend tell it to his friend." At these words the
brethren

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

were silent. Then the elder Ānanda addressed the Lord, "Wonderful,
reverend sir, marvellous, reverend sir, in this assembly of brethren
there is not even a single brother who is in doubt or uncertainty about
the Buddha, or the doctrine, or the assembly, or the path, or the course
of conduct." "With faith, Ānanda, have you spoken, and in this matter,
Ānanda, the Tathāgata has the knowledge that in this assembly not even a
single brother is in doubt or uncertainty about the Buddha, or the
doctrine, or the assembly, or the path, or the course of conduct. For in
this assembly of five hundred brethren the lowest brother has entered
the stream, is not liable to be born in a lower state of existence, is
sure, and destined to attain perfect knowledge." Then the Lord addressed
the brethren, "Well then, brethren, I now exhort you. Impermanent are
compound things; strive with earnestness." These were the last words of
the Tathāgata.

Then the Lord reached the first Ecstasy, and ascending from the first he
reached the second, from the second he reached the third, and from the
third he reached the fourth. From the fourth he reached the abode of
infinite space, from the Attainment of the abode of infinite space he
reached the abode of infinite consciousness, from the Attainment of the
abode of infinite consciousness he reached the abode of nothingness,
from the Attainment of the abode of

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

nothingness he reached the abode of neither perception nor
non-perception, and from the Attainment of the abode of neither
perception nor non-perception he reached the destruction of sensation
and perception. Then the elder Ānanda addressed the elder Anuruddha,
"Reverend Anuruddha, the Lord has attained Nirvana." "No, friend Ānanda,
the Lord has not attained Nirvana, he has attained the destruction of
sensation and perception." Then the Lord from the Attainment of the
destruction of sensation and perception reached the abode of neither
perception nor non-perception, from the Attainment of the abode of
neither perception nor non-perception he reached the abode of
nothingness, from the Attainment of the abode of nothingness he reached
the abode of infinite consciousness, from the Attainment of the abode of
infinite consciousness he reached the abode of infinite space, from the
Attainment of the abode of infinite space he reached the fourth Ecstasy,
from the fourth the third, from the third the second, from the second
the first, from the first the second, from the second the third, and
from the third the fourth, and immediately after ascending from the
fourth the Lord attained Nirvana.

When the Lord attained Nirvana, at the time of the Nirvana, there was a
great shaking of the earth, terrifying and frightful, and the drums of
the gods resounded. When the Lord attained

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nirvana, at the
time of the Nirvana, Brahma Sahampati uttered this verse:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">All beings in the world must lose  
Their compound selves <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md) and
disappear.  
So such a Master as was he,  
A man unrivalled in the world,  
The Lord endowed with all the powers,  
The All-wise, has Nirvana reached.</span>

</div>

When the Lord attained Nirvana, at the time of the Nirvana, Sakka, king
of the gods, uttered this verse:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Impermanent are compound things,  
Growth is their nature and decay;  
They grow up, and they cease again,  
Good is it when they pass away.</span>

</div>

When the Lord attained Nirvana, at the time of the Nirvana, the elder
Anuruddha uttered these verses:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

No longer breathed he in or out  
With firm-fixed mind, the Holy one,  
Free from desires, in peace resting,  
Then when the great Sage passed away.

With mind unshaken, resolute,  
Did he endure the suffering.  
As the extinction of a flame,  
Even so was his mind's release.

</div>

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> When the Lord
attained Nirvana, at the time of the Nirvana the elder Ānanda uttered
this verse:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Then was a terrifying dread,  
Then was a frightful awe and fear,  
When he adorned with all the signs, <span

The All-wise One, Nirvana reached.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_20"></span>[116:1](busc24.htm#fr_20.md) *Samussayam*, "The
result of the temporary collocation of the aggregations (khandha) of
mental and material qualities which give to each being . . . its outward
and visible shape, its individuality. *Loka* is here not the world in
our sense, but the locality in the Buddhist universe which such an
individual occupies until it is dissolved."—Prof. Rhys Davids.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[117:1](busc24.htm#fr_21.md) A Buddha has
thirty-two marks or signs on his body, and eighty minor marks. Some of
these are distinguishable in statues of Buddha, *e.g.* the conical
protuberance of the skull, and the hair in short curls, which is
represented by small knobs on the head. At the Great Renunciation he cut
his hair short, and it remained two fingers long for life.

The powers spoken of by Brahma are the ten powers of a Buddha. See the
list on [p. 90](busc19.htm#page_90.md).
