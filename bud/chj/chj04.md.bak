### CHAPTER II

<span class="smallcaps">The Stage on which S’akyamuni made his
Appearance</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Sūtras which are commonly received as
giving an authentic account of the teachings of the S’akyamuni, <span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) will also furnish us with certain
geographical and other data which are necessary for us if we would form
a correct picture of India in the sixth century B.C., the India in which
S’akyamuni taught and laboured. <span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md)

We need not take a very wide geographical survey. What actually concerns
us is a small portion of the valley of the Ganges, comprising
practically the two districts of Oudh and Behar, <span
id="fr_3"></span>[3](#fn_3.md) stretching to the east as far as Patna, to
the west as far as Allahabad. The Himalayas form the northern boundary
of S’akyamuni's country, the Ganges is practically its southern limit;
the only exception being that Bodhigaya and the district intimately
connected with the Enlightenment of the Tathāgata lie to the south of

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

the sacred river. Later developments of the Buddhist communities may
make it necessary for us to enlarge our geographical inquiries, but for
the present these boundaries will suffice for our consideration. They
will enable us to follow the life of the Great Master in all its
principal phases.

The Buddhist Sūtras tell us a good deal about the population of the
country in which the Wheel of the Law was set in motion.

The India of S’akyamuni's time was under the domination of an Aryan
race, which had conquered the land and brought into it institutions not
unlike those which we find in some other Aryan countries, Athens, for
instance. <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md) They had divided the
population into four great castes, of whom the fourth, possibly also the
third, may have been mixed with some of the conquered races, whilst the
two higher ones certainly belonged to the nobility of the conquest. In
S’akyamuni's time the *Sudras*, or low-caste people, and the *Vaiśyas*,
or merchants and farmers, lived quietly, without any part or lot in the
privileges of national life, contented to devote themselves to the
pursuit of their several vocations; the *Kshatriyas* and *Brahmans*,
having accomplished the subjugation of the other two castes, were
struggling against each other for supremacy in State and Society. Chief
among the Kshatriyan tribes which resisted the supremacy claimed by the
Brahmans were the clans known collectively as the S’akyans, who were
politically supreme in the districts actually affected by S’akyamuni's
life. S’akyan was, however, only a collective name: the clans were
distinguished

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

from one another by tribal names as well, such as Licchāvis, Vrijjis,
Mallas, Andhas, etc., some of which remain to the present day. The
S’akyan nobles, <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) it is said, welcomed
the person of S’akyamuni, their kinsman prophet, whose teachings
encouraged them in their resistance to Brahman usurpations, but they
were not always equally willing to adopt his practical teachings. The
Brahmans, ultimately victorious in the struggle for political and
religious supremacy in India, have had their revenge on these S’akyan
tribes by refusing to consider them as families of pure descent. It is
hard to determine the point. All Buddhists claim that S’akyamuni's
lineage came from *Ikshvaku*, <span id="fr_6"></span>[2](#fn_6.md) the
descendant of Manu, the descendant of Brahma. Licchāvis ruled later, by
virtue of Kshatriyan descent, in Nepaul, Bhutan, Ladakh, and (through
marriage) in Tibet, and the Licchāvi dynasty in Nepaul was succeeded by
a line of Malla kings. At the same time it must be admitted that we have
from the very earliest times traces of intercourse between Nepaul,
Tibet, and China, which should be considered.

China, as shown by the late Prof. Lacouperie and others, *e.g.* Mr.
Morse (in his "Trade and Administration of the Chinese Empire"), was
occupied, before the advent of the Chinese from Western Asia, by many
aboriginal

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

tribes, whom it took the Chinese centuries to absorb successfully into
themselves. Many of these original tribes, such as the Lolo, the
Mantsze, and the Miao, took leading parts in Chinese history, and many
of them would seem to have had dealings with nations beyond the borders
of their empire. The earliest traditions of Nepaul ascribe the first
draining and development of their land, in pre-Buddhistic times, to the
Bodhisattva *Manjuśri* (Jap. *Monju*), whose chief temple is at
*Wu-tai-chan*, near Pekin, who is the patron deity, *par excellence*, of
the western and northern tribes of China, and who is considered to be
perpetually reincarnated in the person of the *Manchu* sovereign of
China. <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md) It seems probable, therefore,
that *Manjuśri* <span id="fr_8"></span>[2](#fn_8.md) was originally the
deified hero of one of the tribes of Northern China, possibly the
*Mantsze*, that he distinguished himself during his lifetime by his
successful development and colonization of Nepaul, and that he was

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

subsequently adopted into the Buddhist pantheon by the all-embracing
Mahāyāna. As M. Sylvain Levi has said, it is impossible as yet
adequately to define the extent of the influence exerted on Buddhism in
remote times by China and neighbouring countries.

Buddhism has always been the religion of merchants. The Sūtras tell us
of many wealthy traders who supported the order by their generous
donations. There must have been a great volume of trade. The S’akyan
nobles, who constantly address S’akyamuni as *gotama*, "herdsman"
(apparently a common mode of address), were of the same race as the
herdsmen of the Himalayas. There is at least one Sutra which speaks of
the wool merchant from across the mountains, and it is indeed to
wandering S’akyan herdsmen that is attributed the opening up of the
valley of Lhassa in Thibet. One of S’akyamuni's earliest disciples was a
merchant's son from Benares named Yaśas. He has been identified
(wrongly, as I think) with S’anavaśas, the third patriarch of the
Northern succession. Now, S’anavaśas is described as having been a
ship-captain. True, he may only have been the skipper of a Ganges barge;
but there are two later patriarchs of whom it is expressly stated that
they had penetrated as far as Turkestan in their travels.

To the lowest class, the Sudras, belonged one at least of S’akyamuni's
disciples, Upali, the barber. But there are traces of lower strata of
society more degraded even than the Sudras. There is a record of a
mission, <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) conducted by the master in
person, to a tribe of cannibals, whom he

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

converted to better ways; and many have seen in the Nāgas, Gandhāras,
Kinnaras, and other half-mythical companies of beings, the traces of
aboriginal tribes of a low order. This is especially the case with the
Nāgas, who are so constantly appearing in the Sūtras. They were most
probably savages whose name was given to them from their worship of
serpents (still practised in India). In the Nepaulese legend they appear
as the original inhabitants of the swamps opened up by the civilizing
Manjuśri. Driven out by Manjuśri, they take refuge in *Nāgaloka*, <span
id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) the world of the Nāgas, or serpents, which
to the Nepaulese is Thibet. Strange to say, the Thibetan records also
speak of Nāgas and Nāgaloka; but in their case Nāgaloka is China. This
seems to me to be another instance of a very early intercourse between
India and China, or at least with those districts of Central Asia which
had early connections with that empire.

Hindoo philosophy, such as we now understand it, <span
id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_11.md)

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

did not exist. That would seem to have been the product of a later age.
The Brahman religion existed, but in its infancy. The day of the Vedic
gods was not yet over; men still bowed before Indra, Varuna, and the
rest of the ancient deities, and the gods whom Buddhism has adopted into
its pantheon, such as, *e.g.*, the twin deities that guard the entrance
to the temples of the older sects in Japan, belong exclusively to the
early period. The Brahmans had doubtless begun the formation of the
theological system which was to fetter the intellect as it had fettered
the social liberties of the people; but the system was not yet
completed, and there were many among the Kshatriyas who openly resisted
the pretensions of the sacerdotal class. <span
id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md) It was, also, a period of great religious
zeal and inquiry. Time and again, in reading the biographical notices
connected with the proceedings of S’akyamuni, we find that his converts
were men who had for years been searchers after truth; in some cases,
as, *e.g.*, that of Uruvilva Kaśyapa, they had themselves been religious
teachers, and drew their own followers after them to swell the ranks of
S’akyamuni's disciples. But it would seem as though before S’akyamuni's
time there was but one path known for the searcher after truth to
follow—the way of austerities and penance, which brought power and
influence to the sacerdotal Brahmans, without always leading the
searcher to the much-coveted enlightenment and peace. <span
id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md)

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

Not all these searchers were convinced by Buddha's methods. S’akyamuni
had many rivals, of whom one at least founded a system of belief which
has endured to our own time. Mahāvīra, the founder of the Jain sect, was
the contemporary of S’akyamuni, and died in the Kosala country, not many
miles from the place where S’akyamuni went to his rest, apparently in
the same year as his more celebrated rival. Jainism and Buddhism are
kindred faiths, and the Jainists and Buddhists seem to have always
looked upon one another as brethren, or, at least, as spiritual
cousins. <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md)

It was in such a country and in such an age that S’akyamuni was born.
The son of Suddhodhana, King of Kapilavastu, and of his wife, the Lady
Māyā, his birth is said to have been accompanied with marvels which
really belong to a later chapter of our book, and his boyhood was marked
by a singular precocity of intellect and purity of character. The wise
men summoned to the palace at the time of his birth, <span
id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15.md) and especially one of their number, the
aged sage Asita, told the happy father that the newborn babe would be
either an epoch-making emperor or a world-saving Buddha; and the father,
feeling perhaps that charity should begin at home, determined that, if
possible, his son should be prepared for the former of the two
alternatives. The young Prince Siddhartha was brought up as became a
S’akyan prince of high degree; trained in arms, literature, and science,
he was surrounded

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

with nothing but objects pleasant for his eye to rest upon, and the most
beautiful person in his harem was his wife, the carefully selected
Princess Yasodhārā. <span id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md)

Many incidents, however, show that his mind was not at ease in the midst
of all his luxury, and this feeling of dissatisfaction was increased by
several sights which brought home to him the inherent misery of the
world. A ceremonial ploughing-festival, which, as Crown Prince. it was
his duty to attend, revealed to him the strife that there is in Nature,
the upturned earth showing the worms cut in two by the ploughshare to
become the prey of the birds that followed in the wake of the ploughman.
Shortly after, he met, at short intervals, an aged person, a sick man, a
corpse, and a holy monk. He learned about the sorrow and pain that there
are in the world, he also learned that there was a way by which escape
from the "Welt-schmerz" was possible, and he resolved to follow it. He
had received his call, and he obeyed the vocation.

It was not mere selfishness that induced him to leave his home to follow
after the Truth. When he bent over the sleeping forms of his beloved
wife and his new-born son at the moment of his departure, he resolved
that, when he had found the Way, he would come back and save his loved
ones, and he kept his promise. But the Way was not easy to find, and the
search was long and difficult. For six long years, by self-imposed
fastings, austerities, and penance, his strained soul, dwelling in an
emaciated body, constantly exposed to the temptations of Māra, the Evil
One, searched patiently for the Truth, but

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

in vain. At last he gave up his fruitless efforts, partook of food after
a long abstinence, had one last combat with the Evil One who strove to
appeal to his pride and fear, and then sat down "under the fig-tree" at
Bodhi-Gaya and awaited enlightenment. Had he been a Christian or a Jew,
we might have said that "he listened to what the Lord God should say
unto him."

What his soul heard was as follows: "(1) There is Pain in the world, and
Pain is universal. (2) All pain is the result of Concupiscence
(*Trishna*). (3) Destroy Concupiscence and you free yourself from Pain.
(4) There is a path by which you can attain to the Destruction of
Concupiscence, and its end is Liberation." The Liberation is what is
known as Nirvana, and the "result of Concupiscence," which leads to
action, is Karma.

These propositions are known as the Four Great Truths. They contained
nothing new, and yet the Light which S’akyamuni threw upon them was a
fresh one. *Karma* and *Nirvana* were words well known to India before
S’akyamuni's discovery of them; the things themselves were known in
Greece and to the Jewish people.

The great question of the retribution that waits on human actions had
been brought solemnly before the Asiatic world by the impressive fall of
the Babylonian Empire, before both Asia and Europe, during the lifetime
almost of S’akyamuni himself, by the overthrow of Xerxes at Marathon and
Salamis. The Greek theologian-poet Æschylus treated of this theme in his
"Eumenides," and again in his tragedy of the "Persians." The prophet of
the Captivity, Ezekiel, had been proclaiming to his countrymen (Ezek.
xviii.) a new law of retribution. Each soul, said the prophet, should
bear its own burdens; there should be no more reason to say in Israel,
"the fathers had eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth had been

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

set on edge." We shall also do well to remember that the deutero-Isaiah
and Ezekiel had both insisted on the value and benefit of the sabbath
day, and that a fresh impetus had been given to the moral law by the
labours of Ezra, the reviser of Holy Scripture (Isa. lvi. 6, 7; Ezek.
xx. 12, etc., xviii. 2, etc.; Deut. viii. 12; Ps. cxix.).

What S’akyamuni taught was this: the universal existence of Pain (and
Pain must be taken in its widest sense); the root of Pain, which is the
Lust that is in the human heart; the end to be attained, which is the
Destruction of Desire; and the way to obtain it. Desire, Karma, the
wheel of Life and Death: the quenching of Desire, the Destruction of
Karma, the Peace of Nirvana. <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) Karma
is no Nemesis, such as in Æschylus pursues the unjust and the slayer.
Nemesis is vengeful, seems to be given to wrath, and to be guided by
anger; Nemesis, to men's eyes, is fitful, irregular, and therefore
unjust. Karma, as S’akyamuni saw it, is a universal law, working quietly
and steadily along a twelve-fold chain of causation, and binding its
victim to the ever-revolving wheel of Life and Death. It works
unobtrusively, but surely; yet it can be broken. There is what
S’akyamuni calls a noble Eight-fold Path, of right views, right aims,
right actions, etc., which leads in time to the destruction of evil
Karma by the quenching of Desire, and it seems to have been S’akyamuni's
life-work to instil into his hearers the way of the Noble Path, which
alone can lead to emancipation. Of philosophy he spoke but little; <span
id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md) the so-called Philosophy of Buddhism was a
later product.

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

He did not profess to teach a new doctrine. What he taught was the "Way
of the Buddhas." <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md) He recognized that
there had been Buddhas before him, <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md)
as there would be Buddhas after him. He was thus enabled freely to adopt
many things that seemed good in systems other than his own, and
flexibility has always been a mark of his religion. To us it will seem
easy to conjecture the quarter from which he got his idea of a weekly
sabbath, <span id="fr_21"></span>[3](#fn_21.md) and the fact that the Order
of Monks kept their sabbath days for many centuries after the Nirvana
will make it easier for us to recognize and admit the doctrine held by a
large section of northern Buddhists, that Buddha also taught, personally
and during his earthly life, the salvation worked out for many by
another Buddha, who is Boundless in Life, Light, and Compassion, and
whom Japan knows as Amitābha. <span id="fr_22"></span>[4](#fn_22.md)

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

S’akyamuni was no atheist. He did indeed teach that the enlightened
Buddha was higher than the gods of the Brahman pantheon, higher than
Indra, Varuna, Agni, Emma-San or Kompira Sama, who now fill subordinate
places in Buddhist temples. These gods were creatures of fancy, subject,
like Venus, Juno, Neptune, to the Law of Change, and liable to that
extinction which has befallen the gods of Assyria and Babylon, of Egypt,
Greece, and ancient Rome. From the denial of such gods to the denial of
all gods is a very long step, and I think it may be shown that
S’akyamuni never took it. Rather I would say, and this I hope to make
clear as I proceed, that wherever S’akyamuni's own influence reached, it
served to give men higher and truer ideas of the Divine Nature, and that
his teachings were thus intended to prepare the way for the acceptance
of the highest of all truths.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1"></span>[5:1](chj04.htm#fr_1.md) *Cf*., in Japanese, "Buddha
no Juseiron" (by Maeda); in English, "Buddhism in Translation" (Warren),
"Gospel of Buddha" (Paul Carus); and in German, "Die Reden des Gotama
Buddhas" (Neumann). The first of these is the most useful for the
purposes of this book, because it has been compiled from a frankly
Mahāyānistic point of view.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[5:2](chj04.htm#fr_2.md) The importance of the sixth
century B.C., which inaugurated so many movements of a religious and
philosophical nature, it is hard to overestimate.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[5:3](chj04.htm#fr_3.md) Behar is said to derive its
name from *Vihara*, a Buddhist monastery. It was one of the last, as it
was also one of the first, strongholds of Buddhism in India.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[6:1](chj04.htm#fr_4.md) In Athens we find, *e.g.*,
the population of the autochthons divided into four classes
corresponding to the four castes of India. *Cf*. Grote's "Hist. of
Greece," chap. x. For the Aryan races, see Hunter, "Brief History of the
Indian people," chap. iv. pp. 52–73.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[7:1](chj04.htm#fr_5.md) The documents tell us how
eagerly the S’akyans of Kapilavastu and Magadha welcomed the teachings
of Buddha. The very name S’akyamuni implies that he was officially
accepted as the "teacher of the S’akyans," and that his creed became, as
it were, the national religion of the district, though Brahmanism still
continued to be tolerated. There are, however, *e.g.* in Kern's "History
of Buddhism," stories which show that S’akyamuni had to maintain his
claim as a religious teacher by demonstrating to the satisfaction of the
S’akyan nobles that he was as skilful in the use of arms as they were
themselves.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[7:2](chj04.htm#fr_6.md) Hewett, "Notes on Early
History of India," pt. ii., in *J.R.A.S*, April, 1889, p. 276, has a
note to show that the *Ikshvakus* came from Assyria and the Euphrates
valley.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[8:1](chj04.htm#fr_7.md) Prof. Pelliot, in "Bulletin
de L’École Française de l’Extrēme Orient," viii. 3 and 4, has an account
of a recent find of manuscripts and books which will do much to settle
the question of Manjuśri. According to the Tibetan history recently
published at Calcutta, with Index and Analysis, by Sarat Chandra Das,
the conversion of India must be ascribed to S’akyamuni and his consort
Tarā, that of Bactria and Central Asia to the labours of the
Bodhisattvas, that of China to Manjuśri or Manjughosha, and that of
Tibet to Avalokiteśvara. The mention of Tarā clearly shows the lateness
of the tradition, but there is in Mr. Tada Kanae's lectures on the
*Shōshinge* ("Shōshinge Kōwa," p. 289) mention)f a certain Buddhist
patriarch who went from India to China because he heard that Manjuśri
had been there, as though Manjuśri had once been a real person living in
China. If Manjuśri may be considered as a real person, and if the
Bodhisttvas of Central Asia are also historical, it may be possible to
assign the place of origin of many of the Mahāyāna Sūtras according to
the speakers in them, those of Central Asian origin being mainly spoken
by one or other of the Bodhisattvas, and those intended, as it were, for
the Chinese market bearing the Manjuśri influence, at least in later
revisions. But it is impossible to dogmatize with the scanty information
at hand.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[8:2](chj04.htm#fr_8.md) Sylvain Levi, "Histoire du
Nepal," vol. ii. p. 69.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[9:1](chj04.htm#fr_9.md) This incident is of
importance as showing one of the best features of the creed as taught by
S’akyamuni. The Brahman religion frankly left out of consideration all
those who were not of the "Twice-born," which was the name given to the
privileged castes. The Kshatriyas, or Warriors (amongst whom we must
include the S’akyans), whilst eager to assert the privileges of their
order as against the sacerdotal caste, were <span id="page_10">p.
10</span> not perhaps equally eager to have emphasis laid on the
universal character of the new faith. The Buddha was not fighting for
the privileges of any class, but was busied with a salvation which was
to be a blessing to all men alike. His mission to the cannibals must
have been as distasteful to the Kshatriyas as it was to the Brahmans.
See Watanabe's "Story of Kalmasapada," published by Pali Text Society,
1910.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[10:1](chj04.htm#fr_10.md) See Sylvain Levi,
*l.c.*, and the Analytical Index to the Tibetan "History of the Rise,
Progress, and Downfall of Buddhism in India," edited by Sarat Chandra
Das (Calcutta, 1908). See also article on "Serpent Worshiper India," by
Surgeon-Major Oldham in *J.R.A.S* for July, 1891. For us the question of
the Nāgas will have special interest, because the Mahāyāna tradition
asserts that it was a Nāga king that revealed to Nāgārjuna, in the
Dragon Palace under the Sea, the holy text of the Avataṃsaka, or Kegon
Scriptures.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[10:2](chj04.htm#fr_11.md) I think it may be shown
that there was very little philosophy before S’akyamuni's time, nothing
like the six definite schools which appear in later centuries. The
philosophy of the Hindoos arose partly from the need for definite
thought brought out by the controversies between Brahmans, Buddhists,
and sectaries, and partly also from <span id="page_11">p. 11</span>
contact with extraneous thought, especially Greek. It is interesting to
trace the contemporaneous development of philosophy in India and in
Greece.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[11:1](chj04.htm#fr_12.md) The order of the castes
in Buddhist authors is (1) Kshatriyas, (2) Brahmans, (3) Vaiśyas, (4)
Sudras. See *J.R.A.S*, April, 1894, pp. 341 ff.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[11:2](chj04.htm#fr_13.md) And yet S’akyamuni's
preaching was nothing new. He was appealing to truths which had been
overlaid and forgotten. Nichiren speaks of a Buddhism before Buddha.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[12:1](chj04.htm#fr_14.md) It is quite in
accordance with the proper fitness of things that in *Kim* Rudyard
Kipling should make the old Lama seek a home for himself at Benares in a
Jain monastery.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[12:2](chj04.htm#fr_15.md) A Chinese legend,
undoubtedly false, says that Laotze was present on that occasion. It is
perhaps also worthy of notice that later Chinese legend credits Laotze
with a virgin birth from the side of his mother, which is very much like
that ascribed to S’akyamuni in the Buddhist traditions. The same claim
was made for Jinghis Khan and Christ.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[13:1](chj04.htm#fr_16.md) Out of whom later
Buddhist legend has developed the goddess *Tarā*, the spiritual consort
of the glorified S’akyamuni, intended, possibly, to offset the claims of
the B.V.M. as S’akyamuni in the Mahāyāna was intended to offset those of
Christ.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[15:1](chj04.htm#fr_17.md) If we remember that most
Pali writers speak of the Enlightenment as the *Nibbana* and of the
Death as *Parinibbana*, we shall have some light on the word *Nirvana*.
S’akyamuni had had a vision of the Truth, and "the Truth had made him
free." He had many doubts and troubles after that, but he was at peace
(*J.AŚ.B.*, Jan. 1908, p. 9, *note*).

</div>

<span id="fn_20"></span>[16:2](chj04.htm#fr_20.md) There is a list given of
these pre-Buddhistic Buddhas, in, *e.g.*, Hardy's "Manual of Buddhism."

<span id="fn_21"></span>[16:3](chj04.htm#fr_21.md) *Sabbath*. In the
*Proceedings* of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. iv. part 1, Jan.
1908, there is an article by Mr. H. C. Norman, showing that the question
of the keeping of the *Uposathas* or sabbath days was one of the causes
that led to the convening of As’oka's Council. The sabbath was, however,
a Babylonian and Assyrian institution as well as a Jewish one. See
Mahler, "Der Sabbat," in *Z.D.M.G.*, vol. lxii. part i. p. 36, etc.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[16:4](chj04.htm#fr_22.md) On this point the
Japanese Buddhists with few exceptions are very clear. They place the
Sūtras in which S’akyamuni spoke of Amitābha in that period of silence
towards the end of his ministerial life when we lose our track of him,
and can no longer follow him from year to year. The doctrine thus
proclaimed was taken with the seceders after the Second Council beyond
the Himalayas (some say to south India). It reappears after many years,
in the country to which it had been taken, in the lifetime of Nāgārjuna,
and when the Kushan conquests <span id="page_17">p. 17</span> had united
North-West India and the Central Asian lands for a short while under one
sceptre. The history of the Amitābha doctrine is well worked out in the
"Shôshinge Kōwa," to which I have already alluded. Amitābha is the
original Buddha, the First Cause, the Father, not exactly the Creator,
but the originator of the Law of Cause and Effect through which the
universe came into existence. He has revealed himself many times, the
long list of previous Buddhas in the *Sukhāvati Vyūha* being recorded to
give definiteness to this idea, and S’akyamuni was the latest of these
manifestations. The Ophite Gnostics held exactly this idea, making
Christ a still later manifestation superseding all that had gone before,
just as Amitābha supersedes all other previous Buddhas. In connection
with the questions thus raised, a Japanese scholar, much interested in
religion, has pointed out to me that in some early forms of the
Apostle's Creed there is no clause "Creator of heaven and earth." I
shall have to refer to the character used for writing "Buddha" later on.
Here I would point out that Buddha to the Shinshu believer is always
Amitābha, whose "Divine Name" is pronounced in worship as *Namu Amida
Butsu*. This formula is interpreted to mean, "Trust in me, I will save
you," which is not a translation of the formula, but is one of the Name
of Christ. The Shinshuists call this formula "the Divine Name of the Six
Letters," for which see Irenæus, ii. 24.
