### CHAPTER XIX

<span class="smallcaps">Buddhism during the Nara Period</span> <span
id="fr_239"></span>[1](#fn_237.md) <span class="smallcaps">from A.D.
621–782</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> activities of Kumarajīva seem to have
led to the dismemberment of the Mahāyāna, which, in spite of the variety
of doctrines it contained within its ample folds, had hitherto contrived
to preserve a united front. The sectarianism of Chinese Buddhism was
aided by the distracted state of the Chinese Empire, broken up into many
kingdoms, each striving for the mastery; and we have seen some of these
rival states casting about for supporters, and trying to enlist sympathy
for themselves in the Korean peninsula and in Japan. We have seen Korea
similarly divided into warring kingdoms, some of which—Kudara and
Mimāna—looked to Japan for aid, while Shiragi, relying on Chinese
support from the kingdom of the Wei, boldly resisted Japanese
intervention; and Koma, too weak for independent action, sat on a fence
and vacillated between Japan and Shiragi, according to the interests of
the hour. And, lastly, we have seen Japan under Shōtoku Taishi gradually
inclining more and more towards a following of China, and taking the
Empire of the Sui (590–618) as its model, both in religion and in
secular politics.

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

Shōtoku died in 621. Three years before his death, the dynasty of the
Sui, in China, with its costly ambition and magnificence, had been
obliged to make way for the family of the Tangs, who ruled till 907, and
who inaugurated a period of greatness and prosperity such as China had
not known since the downfall of the great House of Han in 220 A.D.

The Tangs began badly for Buddhism. Kaotsu (618–627), their first ruler,
broke up Buddhist monasteries right and left, and sent 100,000 bonzes
back to lay life where they would be obliged to work, and neither his
successor Taitsung nor his wife Ch’angsun <span
id="fr_240"></span>[1](#fn_238.md) had any sympathies for the faith. But
the Buddhists knew how to win their way back to favour in the course of
a few years, and the Tangs had not been fifty years on the throne in
China ere Buddhism was once more in full force, and on a far more
splendid basis than before. Under the Tangs it became essentially a
Chinese faith; it had, as it were, discarded its Indian waistcloth and
adopted the flowing robes of the Celestial.

In the selfsame year that Shōtoku Taishi died, there was erected at
Singanfu, at that time the capital, the first Zoroastrian temple ever
built in China. The Tangs had owed very much to the support of the
Turkish tribes on the western frontier of China in the days when they
were busy winning their crown, and it was probably due to this

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

connection between the Empire and the tribes on its borders that the
Magians took the opportunity of preaching in China itself. Singanfu,
which lies in the province of Shensi, is not far removed from the then
abodes of the Turkish tribes; indeed, it was once suggested to Kaotsu,
by some pusillanimous advisers, that he should remove his capital to
some safer spot in the province of Honan, where he would be free from
the danger of incursions from the barbarians.

The year of Shōtoku's death was also the year of the Hejirah, the year
in which Mohammed fled to Medina and announced his divine mission to the
astonished world. Ten years later, Izdegerd, King of Persia, was
fighting for his very existence against the victorious Arabs who had
gone forth conquering and to conquer, and by the year 640 the whole of
Persia, with Merv, Balkh, Herat, everything as far as the Indus and the
Oxus, had submitted to the sword of the new-born enthusiasm. That
Persia, in the pangs of her last crisis, appealed to China for help is
known. After Izdegerd's death in 651, his son fled into Turkestan, from
whence he made his way to China. He succeeded in persuading the Chinese
to take over the administration of the whole country between their
frontier and that of the Arabs, and it was as Chinese Viceroy of that
district that he was attacked and defeated by the Arabs in 670, and
obliged once more to flee to Singanfu. <span
id="fr_241"></span>[1](#fn_239.md)

Was it chance, or was it the design of Heaven, that, in the year 636,
shortly after Izdegerd had entered upon his last fatal war against the
Arabs, there arrived in Singanfu a Christian mission hailing from
Persia?

When the Nestorian protest against the use of the word Theotokos as
applied to the mother of Our Lord

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

had been condemned by the Council of Ephesus in A.D. 431, the followers
of Nestorius, finding themselves liable to unjust persecution in the
Roman Empire, withdrew into Persia, where they were well received, and
enabled to establish flourishing communities, not only in Persia, but in
Balkh, Merv, Central Asia, and India. They were loyal to the country of
their adoption, as well they might be; that country was now in distress,
and was looking to China for help; a Christian mission in China might be
productive of much good, both spiritually and politically. The mission
was, therefore, sent; <span id="fr_242"></span>[1](#fn_240.md) it arrived
at Singanfu in 636, and was well received by the Emperor and his
successors, some of whom issued edicts in favour of the faith, or gave
money for building "temples of felicity," as they were called, whilst
one went so far in his patronage that,

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

without becoming a Christian, he would still keep the Christmas festival
with his Nestorian subjects. There were times of persecution, to be
sure; but the Nestorian missions survived them all. In the year 1293 the
Franciscans under John of Montecorvino arrived at Peking, and found the
Nestorians in full force; in 1304, the Nestorian Patriarch of Baghdad,
the head of the whole Nestorian Church, submitted himself to Rome, and
the Chinese Nestorians seem to have thought it best to follow his
example. In 1305, John de Montecorvino reported very large accessions to
his flock, and the Nestorians of China disappear from history.

There was also in Singanfu and its neighbourhood the zeal of Buddhism,
aroused by the sense of its new dangers. The luxury of the Sui, and of
many of the sovereigns of the illegitimate states, had been suffered by
the Buddhists to go unreproved. Nay, they had profited by the
distractions and evils of the times, and had secured for themselves
wealth, position, and exemptions from taxation as the price of the
support they gave to luxurious and ambitious princes. All these things
had brought upon them the hatred and contempt of the lettered classes,
and the undisguised hostility of powerful sovereigns, like Kaotsung and
others, must have warned them to set their house in order if they would
continue in their former prosperity. We can see many signs of this
movement of reform produced by fear. The new school of translation
inaugurated by Kumarajīva, the suggested amalgamation of Buddhism with
Taoism, the new revelations (for they amounted to that) of the Hossō and
the Kegon, and the wide-embracing system inaugurated by Chisha Daishi of
the Tendai, all point to the same conclusion.

Bodhidharma and Zendō <span id="fr_243"></span>[1](#fn_241.md) alone aimed
at simplification,

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

but the former was not represented at the capital of the Sui and Tang.
Zendō, however, was there, and his preaching of salvation by faith was
welcomed by the poor. He was the popular preacher of the hour, and the
popularity of his preaching drew upon him the hostility of the other
sects. Tendai, Hossō, Kegon have always been the enemies of the simple
faith preached by Zendō. They have always treated it as something alien
to Buddhism, and so perhaps it was. At any rate, there it was in
Singanfu, side by side with many alien faiths, during that momentous
half-century which meant so very much for the religious development of
the Far East.

It was probably about this time also that the Manichæan missions reached
China proper. They had long ere this time been in the Turfan and Khotan
districts, but probably never reached China itself until the time of the
Tangs. The recent discoveries of German and other explorers are likely
in a short time to add so much to our knowledge of Manichæism that it is
not worth while here to dilate upon the subject. Let us content
ourselves with noting that Manichæism was in China, and was one of the
rivals of Buddhism.

Magians, Christians, Manichæans, three rivals, and the old enemies to
boot, Confucianism and Taoism. With Kaotsu and Taitsung on the throne of
the united empire, and putting down Buddhist monasteries with a strong
hand, things looked very dark indeed for the Chinese Mahāyāna. Hiouen
Thsang was the man who saved it in this crisis. Born in 602, and
admitted to the priesthood in 622, Hiouen Thsang determined to travel to
India and collect accurate information and materials from the original
home of Buddhism for the defence of the faith which he saw threatened
from within and from without. It is quite possible that he mistrusted
the Central Asian traditions.

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Starting in 629,
he made a tour of such Buddhist countries in Central Asia as had not yet
fallen a prey to the Arabs, and in India, where he was royally treated
by the great king Siladitya Harsha, one of the last of its Buddhist
sovereigns. When he returned to China, the movement hostile to Buddhism
had for the time spent its strength, and when, about 646, he published
translations of some of the new books he had brought with him, the
Emperor himself deigned to write a preface. <span
id="fr_244"></span>[1](#fn_242.md)

Hiouen Thsang, the Max Müller of his day, was in direct relations with
Japan. In 655, about the time of the accession of the Empress Saimei, a
priest from Kawachi, a Sōzu <span id="fr_245"></span>[2](#fn_243.md) of the
name of Dōsō, went over to China with the ambassadors sent to announce
the new sovereign's accession, and there, meeting with Hiouen Thsang,
learnt from him the Hossō or Dharma-lakshana doctrines, which the great
doctor was preaching. Five years later, in the same reign, two more
priests, Chitsū and Chitatsu, crossed to China in a ship of Shiragi, and
were initiated into the Hossō mysteries by Hiouen Thsang and his
coadjutor Jion daishi. In the third year of Taihō (704), another batch
of these priests went to China, armed with letters from their sovereign,
and studied the doctrines

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

of the Unity (*Yuishiki*) under Chishō Daishi. Thus three <span
id="fr_246"></span>[1](#fn_244.md) distinct strains of Hossō teachings came
to Japan, and blended there, and though the Hossō sect, qua sect,
disappeared shortly after the close of the Nara age, it left permanent
traces in the religious history of the country. For Dōsō and Chitatsu
had as their principal disciple the celebrated Gyōgi Bosatsu <span
id="fr_247"></span>[2](#fn_245.md) to whom is attributed the invention of
the Ryōbu Shintō, <span id="fr_248"></span>[3](#fn_246.md) which made it
possible for Buddhism to strike deep roots in the religious
consciousness of Japan.

If we trace back this teaching to its earliest origin we shall see what
it meant, and how powerfully it was likely to affect the situation in
Japan. We shall also see, incidentally, how far the Mahāyāna had by this
time travelled from the simplicity of S’akyamuni's teachings.

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

The Hossō sect traced itself back to the brothers Asangha and
Vasubandhu, whom we may place at the beginning of the fourth century
A.D. It was an age of syncretism and eclecticism. Mani, the founder of
Manichæism, had already worked out his great religion, which was
destined to spread so widely and to have so extended and varied an
influence, and Mani had laboured in India, as well as studied in
Alexandria and Babylon. The Buddhists in India, hard pressed by the
arguments of Hindu philosophers, such as the doughty Sankarāchārya, were
casting about for new ways of putting their principles before the Hindu
world. The Dharmalakshana or Hossō teachings of Asangha and Vasubandhu
were intended to build a bridge between Hinduism and the Mahāyāna, of
such a nature that the Buddhist might, as it were, invade the territory
of Hinduism and conquer without seeming to do so.

The teaching was based, as I have said, on a revelation or
quasi-revelation. Whilst Asangha was lecturing in Ayodhya, the present
Oude, in India, he received a heavenly visitor, the great Bodhisattva
Maitreya, <span id="fr_249"></span>[1](#fn_247.md) the disciple of
S’akyamuni, who had received the promise of becoming the future Saviour
of the world, and who was waiting in the celestial regions for the
fulness of the times to come. Maitreya, appearing in the lecture hall,
expounded for Asangha a secret and mysterious doctrine which he had been
commissioned to deliver. He had come from a Buddha greater and wiser
than S’akyamuni, from the great Buddha *Loc’ana*, or *Roshana*, whose
colossal statue is now known as the Daibutsu of Nara, and who is not to
be confounded with the Vairoc’ana of the Shingon sect, introduced later
by the Kegon doctors and Kobōdaishi;

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Roshana, said
Maitreya, was the Supreme Being, invisible but all-powerful. When He
showed Himself upon earth, it was through the personality of two great
spiritual Beings, Maitreya Himself, and Manjuśri, the potent Bodhisattva
of China. <span id="fr_250"></span>[1](#fn_248.md)

One of the keynotes of the Hossō teaching (it would require a large
volume to describe it all) is the doctrine of Oneness from which the
other name of the sect, the *Yuishikikyō*, or Oneness sect, is derived.
A Christian would say, "God is One, and besides Him there is none
other." But the Hossō sect (if we may use the word "God" for Buddhist
speculations) would put it a little otherwise. "God is One, and besides
Him there is nothing." The Universe, or God (for the two were treated as
identical) was looked upon as a mighty ocean, unfathomable and
unlimited, and the phenomena of nature and life, trees and plants, birds
and beasts, sun and stars, men, angels, and even the gods whom men
worshipped, were but the waves which appear for a moment on the surface,
vanish, and reappear in a different shape. The wave I look at now is but
a rearrangement of the drops in the wave which appeared in a different
shape in another part of the bay. The god I worship now, on the Himalaya
slopes, I call by the name of S’akyamuni; rearrange the particles that
compose him, and he will appear presently on the plains of the Ganges as
the Hindu Vishnu. The name and the form have been changed, the essence
which is a part of the great Ocean of the Universe, which is God, is
unchanged, and remains identically the same. Thus it came in India that
men passed from one cult to

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

the other, and that the Hindus, to this day, look upon S’akyamuni as one
incarnation of their god Vishnu.

This was the doctrine which enabled Gyōgi Bosatsu, and other leading
priests of the Nara period, to propound the doctrine of Ryōbu-Shinto (or
*Ryōbu-Bukkyō*, as it is also called). According to this doctrine, the
ancient gods of Japan, Amaterasu, the goddess of the Sun, and the other
divinities whom the Japanese had brought from their unknown original
homes on the continent of Asia, were not independent spiritual Beings,
but merely fresh incarnations of that same divine Essence which had
moved for a while on the surface of things, as this or that one of the
great Bodhisattvas and Buddhas of the Indian religion. Buddhism had not
come to destroy the faith of Japan, but to strengthen it with the
additional light that was shining forth from India and China. How far
the movement was a popular one, may be doubted. The common people
counted for very little in those days; it was an oracle, issuing from
the Temple at Isé, that authoritatively proclaimed the identity of
Amaterasu and Vairoc’ana. <span id="fr_251"></span>[1](#fn_249.md) A few
years before, in the year 616, the great god of Miwa <span
id="fr_252"></span>[2](#fn_250.md) had very obligingly let it be known
throughout Japan that the proper ministers to take charge of funeral
rites were the Buddhist clergy. <span id="fr_253"></span>[3](#fn_251.md)
This amounted practically to an endowment of Buddhism.

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

Another sect which made its appearance in Japan during the Nara period
was the Kegon, or Avataṃsaka sect, which was introduced in 736. It was
one of purely Chinese origin, though the books on which it was based
came originally from India, and had been founded at the end of the Sui
and beginning of the Tang dynasties, between 600 and 660, by a priest
whose name the Japanese pronounce as Tojun (<span id="img_20200"></span>
![](img/20200.jpg)). It represented, when it arose, one of the latest
developments of Chinese Buddhist thought (it came into prominence a
little after the Hossō). The Japanese have always wanted to have the
very latest in every department of human thought.

Like the Hossō, the Kegon went back for its origin to the very
beginnings of the Mahāyāna. When Nāgārjuna, in his wanderings, had
reached the Himalayas, he was taken to the Dragon Palace under the Sea,
out of which he fetched the wonderful book known as the Avatamsaka
Sūtra, <span id="fr_254"></span>[1](#fn_252.md) which was to form the basis
of the new sect. It is a very difficult book, and very long: many
translators in earlier times had tried their hands at it, but had only
produced fragmentary versions of individual chapters. <span
id="fr_255"></span>[2](#fn_253.md) Now at last, in the Tang period, a
version of the whole was accomplished. The enterprise had the warmest
encouragement from the Court, and one of the Tang empresses early in the
eighth century, not only sent to Khotan to procure a complete copy of
the Sanskrit Sūtra,

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

but also wrote a preface for the Chinese version when it came out. <span
id="fr_256"></span>[1](#fn_254.md) It may have been that, in view of the
close proximity once more of Christianity, Buddhism felt the need of
advancing supernatural claims. <span id="fr_257"></span>[2](#fn_255.md) The
Avataṃsaka Sūtra is full of the supernatural. In the days of
S’akyamuni's life, immediately after he had, under the Bo-tree, attained
to Enlightenment, he had (so it was said) remained in a trance of awe
and wonder for the space of two weeks. It was now alleged that during
that time he had in spirit ascended to the highest heaven, where, in a
kind of Transfiguration, he had conversed with the two great
Bodhisattvas—Manjuśri and Samantabhadra—in the very presence of the
Supreme and Everlasting Buddha Vairoc’ana. <span
id="fr_258"></span>[3](#fn_256.md) The doctrines thus delivered had been of
a very deep and mysterious character, too deep for the ordinary mind of
men to comprehend. S’akyamuni had therefore laid them aside for a while,
and had not reverted to them again until towards the close of his
ministry, when the disciples were sufficiently advanced to receive them.

We have thus, as it were, three different Buddhist

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Trinities—the
Trinity of the Hossō, namely, Roshana, Maitreya, and Manjuśri; that of
the Kegon, Vairoc’ana, Samantabhadra (*Fugen*), and Manjuśri; that of
the Pure Land, Amitābha, Kwannon, and Seishi—all claiming to come from
the beginnings of the Mahāyāna, all supposed to have appeared
simultaneously in China, just at the time when Christian missions first
made their way to that empire, and all three brought over to Japan
during the early years of the Nara period. At bottom the three sets
meant pretty much the same thing, and the ethics of Buddhism were much
the same whoever preached them; but the three represented sectarian
differences, and there speedily appeared rivalries between jealous monks
competing with one another for the favour of the court and nobility.
This was one of the characteristics of the Nara age. <span
id="fr_259"></span>[1](#fn_257.md)

The student who has the time, inclination, and opportunity to prosecute
further the study of this period, will find it full of very valuable
historical material which throws a flood of light on the present life
and thought of the Japanese people. Such a research lies far beyond the
scope of the present work. <span id="fr_260"></span>[2](#fn_258.md) We may,
however, refer to one or two points of importance.

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

Amongst a number of sovereigns of no special importance Kōtoku Tennō
(645–654) is distinguished for the zeal with which he worked along the
lines of political and civil reform laid down by Shōtoku. The Taikwa
reforms (so called from the *Nengo* <span
id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_259.md) or year-period in which they were
issued—an institution then first borrowed from China) brought the
institutions of Japan very near to the Chinese models. The old offices
of the *Ōmi* and *Ōmuraji* <span id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_260.md) were
abolished, and three new officers, with Chinese titles, *Sadaijin*,
*Udaijin*, *Naidaijin*, appointed to take their place. Exact reports
were demanded from the governors of the provinces as to the conditions
and needs of the people, a simple but (for the time) sufficient Court of
Appeal was instituted, in the shape of a box placed at the palace gates
to receive the complaints of the people, provincial boundaries were
fixed, and the *Handen shuja-hō* whilst providing that each peasant
family should have a minimum allotment of rice land (two *tan* for a
man, and a little more than one tan for a woman), also provided for the
revenues of the State by taking one-twentieth of the produce for State
purposes. Thus the State became the universal landlord, and the people
paid a single tax inclusive of rent. The reforms were not carried out
without opposition. Soga Ishikawamaro, who held the office of Udaijin,
was falsely accused

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

by his enemies and unjustly done to death in 649. <span
id="fr_263"></span>[1](#fn_261.md) Less than fifteen years later the
Emperor Tenji (662–671) found it necessary to extirpate the Soga family,
and to call to his assistance the family of the Fujiwara, <span
id="fr_264"></span>[2](#fn_262.md) who have contrived to hold their great
position, in one form or another, down to the present day. Tenji Tennō
outlined the great Taihōryō <span id="fr_265"></span>[3](#fn_263.md) Code
of Laws, which, promulgated in a subsequent reign, in A.D. 701, remained
in force, with but few modifications, right down to the commencement of
the Meiji era.

The Nara period also saw the publication of the two great chronicles of
ancient Japan—the "Kojiki" and the "Nihongi," <span
id="fr_266"></span>[4](#fn_264.md) published, the one in 712, and
containing the history of Japan from the creation to the close of the
reign of the Empress Suiko (A.D. 628); the other, published in 722, and
covering very much the same ground. In estimating their value, it must
be remembered that they are chronicles and not histories, and that, even
so, the writers were obviously inspired with a desire to assert for
Japan an antiquity, and consequently a dignity, equal to that claimed by
the empire of the haughty Tangs. The lives of early sovereigns have
therefore been in some cases extended beyond all bounds of probability,
and

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

there are inconsistencies (not to say falsifications) which modern
writers (even Japanese among them) have not failed to note. <span
id="fr_267"></span>[1](#fn_265.md) There is practically no credible history
of Japan and Japanese events before the introduction of Buddhism.

For the rest, the age was uncritical, superstitious, and therefore
credulous. When the Kegon Scriptures were being expounded in the palace
a pink cloud hovered over the building, which was taken to denote the
presence of a celestial audience. A priest in the mountains of Tamba,
who served a temple dedicated to Kwannon, was snowed up one winter's
day, and, being cut off from access to the outer world for nearly a
week, was in danger of starvation. As he prayed he heard a sound in the
veranda, and, going out, found a joint of venison placed there. He ate
it and lived, though by eating it he broke the laws of Buddhism. Some
time after this, whilst cleaning his temple, he discovered the giver of
the venison. From the thigh of the statue of Kwannon had been cut a
piece of—wood, shall we call it? or flesh?—the exact size of the venison
that had been placed on the veranda. <span
id="fr_268"></span>[2](#fn_266.md) The deity himself, at the cost of a
painful self-sacrifice, had saved the life of his worshipper.

Wonder was in the air, and therefore when the Goddess of Isé proclaimed
her identity with Amitābha, or Vairoc’ana, it was believed; and when the
strange tales of the "Kojiki" came out, they also were accepted in
faith. It is easy to sneer at the ages of credulity; it would be wiser,
perhaps, to look back at the strange stories current in Europe during
the same period, which our forefathers

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

believed with simple credulity. People who live in glass houses cannot
afford to throw stones. At the same time no one could possibly hold up
the Buddhism of the Nara age as a model for any one's admiration or
imitation.

<span class="smallcaps">Additional Note to Chapter XIX.</span>

(Extracted from "Shinran and his Work," as showing the great importance
of Zendō in the history of the Jōdo Mahāyāna.)

<span class="smallcaps">Kōmyōji</span> (<span id="img_20800"></span>
![](img/20800.jpg))

In the year 614 A.D. a boy was born in China. By what precise name his
parents first knew him I do not know. Judging from the analogy of other
men similarly situated, he had many names at different periods of his
life. The name by which he was last known was Zendō (<span
id="img_20801"></span> ![](img/20801.jpg)), but that was almost
certainly not the name of his childhood. His family name was Shu (<span
id="img_20802"></span> ![](img/20802.jpg)), and he was born in the
district of Shishū (<span id="img_20803"></span> ![](img/20803.jpg)).

When he was born the Sui <span id="fr_269"></span>[1](#fn_267.md) dynasty
was tottering to its fall, and had in fact only four years more of life.
Already, we may believe, was the Duke of Tang, on the extreme north-west
boundaries of the Empire, conspiring with Turkish and other chieftains,
and meditating that great coup d'état, which put his master at his mercy
and seated himself firmly on the Celestial

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Throne, as the
founder of a Dynasty, the most magnificent China had ever yet seen, and
which was to continue for well-nigh three centuries. <span
id="fr_270"></span>[1](#fn_268.md) The miseries of the people, heavily
burdened and harassed to support the luxurious and ostentatious
extravagance of the Sui monarchs, tended to encourage his hopes, and
with the practised eye of the statesman he could see that it only needed
a strong man at the helm to make China a world-power with very widely
extending influence. For the inland states on the Western frontiers were
already looking to China for aid against the terror of the Arab, shortly
to be kindled to victory by the enthusiasm of the new faith inspired by
Mahomet, and only a few years were destined to elapse before Persia, at
war with Constantinople, and overrun by the Arabs, should come to China
in the vain hopes of an alliance against the new foe. <span
id="fr_271"></span>[2](#fn_269.md) To give another note of time, Shōtoku
Taishi, <span id="fr_272"></span>[3](#fn_270.md) the greatest of Japan's
early statesmen, and as

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

great in the religious world as he was in the political, was already
busy with his celebrated reforms. The Constitution of the 17 Articles
had already been in force some ten years when Zendō was born; the ruler
of Japan had already given offence to the vainglorious Sovereign of the
Sui by the letter in which the "Eastern Emperor" sent his greeting, as
an equal in rank, to his brother the "Emperor of the West," and Korea,
which had already done so much for Japan in the way of religious and
civilizing influences, was giving Japanese statesmen a good deal of
political anxiety. <span id="fr_273"></span>[1](#fn_271.md)

In matters of religion, Confucianists and Taoists were apparently going
on much as usual; but the Buddhist world, distracted partly by the
immense volume and bulk of its own religious books, and partly by the
multiplicity of the new ideas which the growing commercial activity of
the people was importing from foreign countries, was in a state of
apparently fermenting chaos. <span id="fr_274"></span>[2](#fn_272.md)
Bodhidharma's attempts at reform (A.D. 520) <span
id="fr_275"></span>[3](#fn_273.md) were already a century old, and his way
had already lost some of its prestige: new sects,

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

*e.g.* the Sanron, Jōjitsu, and Tendai, were already in process of
formation, if not actually formed, and Hiouen Thsang had already (A.D.
611) entered the order of monks, <span id="fr_276"></span>[1](#fn_274.md)
and was now preparing for the celebrated journey to India for the
purpose of studying at first hand the doctrines of his faith.

Some reform was certainly needed. In the year 618, the Duke of Tang
deposed his master, and took his seat on the Imperial throne as Kaotsu,
the Founder of the Tang dynasty. One of the most striking incidents of
his reign was the presentation of a petition to the throne against
Buddhism. It was presented by leading men among the *literati* and
Confucianists, and was strongly worded. <span
id="fr_277"></span>[2](#fn_275.md) Kaotsu accepted the petition and acted
upon it. He ordered a general dissolution and suppression of Buddhist
monasteries, and sent 100,000 monks and nuns back into lay life. It was
probably a necessary measure. The monks were very numerous and very
powerful, and they claimed exemption from State control. Abuses of many
kinds are apt to spring up in institutions the members of which claim
not to be placed on the same footing with ordinary citizens.

Zendō entered the Buddhist order at a very early age. I cannot find
whether it was before or after the suppression of the monasteries by
Kaotsu; but it was most probably before that event, and his teacher was
a certain Shōshō (<span id="img_21100"></span> ![](img/21100.jpg)) of
Misshu (<span id="img_21101"></span> ![](img/21101.jpg)), a prominent
person in the then newly-formed Sanron sect. This sect, which is also
called the *Ichi-dai-kyōshu*, or "Sect of the Teachings of Buddha's
whole life," made it a feature of its teachings that it professed to
accept every one of the many thousand volumes of the Mahāyāna Canon as
of equal authority, without assigning to any single one a pre-eminent
place among its compeers. It aimed at the most complete and glorious
comprehensiveness

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (a
comprehensiveness, which, I fear, can only be attained by the sacrifice
of the critical faculty). Zendō's Buddhist biographer <span
id="fr_278"></span>[1](#fn_276.md) adds that he also studied the Vinaya
discipline (a fact which may be taken as showing traces of a somewhat
practical turn of mind), and notices further that, during these student
days, he was continually restless, that he sighed for greater
definiteness, and expressed a longing for that simpler doctrine of
Salvation by Faith in Amida, which has always had its exponents in China
as well as in Japan.

At last, weary of the confusion, he went into the library, prayed for
guidance, closed his eyes, and put out his hand for the book which was
to simplify his Creed. The same story is told of others in Chinese
Buddhism: in Zendō's case, his hand fell upon the volume of the Kwangyō
(the Amitayurdhyāni Sūtra), <span id="fr_279"></span>[2](#fn_277.md) which
relates how S’akyamuni comforted Queen Vaidehi in her distress

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

by reminding her of the mercies of Amitābha, "who is ever near thee."
Zendō read and received comfort; but he could not understand all he
read, and where he was there was none to explain it.

But he heard that, south of the Yangtze, at Rozan (<span
id="img_21300"></span> ![](img/21300.jpg)) there were traditions and
books which might explain what he wanted. It was here that Eon (<span
id="img_21301"></span> ![](img/21301.jpg)), who died A.D. 416, had
worked for thirty years, and had founded, in connection with a body of
friends known as the "eighteen sages of Rozan," a guild known as the
White Lotus Society, which was the first association of Buddhist monks
and laymen for the joint adoration of Amida Butsu. Zendō learned all
that he could at Rozan, and then recommenced his travels, consulting as
many religious teachers as he found likely to be able to give him
helpful advice and counsel. What he learned from these teachers induced
him to adopt a rule of life, known as *han shu sammai* (<span
id="img_21302"></span> ![](img/21302.jpg)), which reads almost like the
stern rule of some Christian ascetic, still more so, perhaps, of that of
some Manichæan fanatic. *Mi tsune ni butsu wo raishi, kuchi tsune ni
butsu wo tonae, kokoro tsune ni butsu wo omou*. "His body ceaselessly
engaged in the worship of Buddha, his mouth ceaselessly engaged in the
recital of Buddha's praises, his heart ceaselessly meditating Buddha."
With this in mind he retired to the Temple of Goshinji (<span
id="img_21303"></span> ![](img/21303.jpg)) in Shunnan, where, amidst
beautiful mountain scenery, and in the solitude of retirement, he "beat
out his music." It is quite evident that this retirement, which lasted
for some years, was of great value in the formation of his religious
ideas. The name of the temple signifies, not inaptly, the "Temple for
the Instruction of Truth." He remained here until his 29th year,
returning to Singanfu in the year A.D. 643. <span
id="fr_280"></span>[1](#fn_278.md)

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

His stay, however, was for a short time only. Ever since his first
conversion to Amidaism in the library, he had evidently been searching
for any traces he could find of Amida followers in China. He had been to
Rozan to examine Eon's literary remains and to get into touch with the
White Lotus Society. We may presume that the Goshinji to which he
retired was a place at which he would find persons in sympathy with his
religious sentiments. Now he heard that Dōshaku (<span
id="img_21400"></span> ![](img/21400.jpg)), the monk who is reckoned as
Zendō's predecessor in the list of Shinshu patriarchs, was teaching in
the district of Shinyō (<span id="img_21401"></span> ![](img/21401.jpg),
Chinyang in Kiangsi), and he set off at once to visit the aged man.

Dōshaku, who is reckoned by the Jōdo Buddhist as the fourth patriarch of
the Amida Doctrines, and therefore as Zendō's immediate predecessor, was
born in Heishū (<span id="img_21402"></span> ![](img/21402.jpg)) in the
year A.D. 553, and died in 636. He had experienced the persecution which
the Buddhists had undergone during the reign of Wu-ti of the Chow (<span
id="img_21403"></span> ![](img/21403.jpg)) Dynasty, <span
id="fr_281"></span>[1](#fn_279.md) and he was one of the few brave ones who
remained faithful in spite of the violence of the storm. His
predecessor, the third patriarch, Donran, <span
id="fr_282"></span>[2](#fn_280.md) had taught with considerable

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

effect in the district in which Dōshaka was born, and though he had been
dead twenty years when Dōshaku came into the world, his influence was
still felt in the neighbourhood. It was kneeling before the stone pillar
erected to Donran's memory that Dōshaku made his vow to propagate the
Doctrine of Salvation by Faith in Amida. Dōshaku was forty-eight years
of age when he thus enrolled himself as a posthumous pupil of Donran's;
but he is said to have developed the doctrine beyond what Donran had
done. Donran had been drawn by the hope of eternal life, and it was this
hope, set before him by the Indian monk Bodhiruci, that had made him
burn his Taoist books of magic and set himself to the study of Amidaism.
In Dōshaku's hands the Amida doctrine had developed in the direction of
personality. He taught (if we may believe his latest biographer, Mr.
Tada) <span id="fr_283"></span>[1](#fn_281.md) that Amida must be
considered to be a personal Being and not a mere abstract ideal, and the
book which he placed in Zendō's hands was the Larger Sukhāvati Vyūha,
the book which gives the account of Amida's life, of His Incarnation in
the person of Hōzō Biku, His labours undertaken for the Salvation of
men, the successful accomplishment of His Great Vow, and His return to
glory as King of His Western Paradise. This doctrine Zendō accepted and
preached. He may be said to have carried the doctrine a stage further.
The followers of Hōnen Shōnin (otherwise known as Genkū) form three
communities: (i) the Shinshu, founded by Shinran, and (ii and iii) the
two sub-sects of the older Jōdo sect, the Chinsei-ha and the
Seizan-ha. <span id="fr_284"></span>[2](#fn_282.md) The Chinsei-ha,
agreeing in this respect with the Shinshu, differ from the Seizan-ha in
the matter of reciting the Nembutsu. The latter community treat the
Nembutsu as an act of adoration addressed to all the Buddhas; the
Chinsei-ha and Shinshu treat it as addressed to Amida alone, as being
the only Buddha, and the one to whom everything else is subordinate and
subservient; and this practice, according to Murakami. <span
id="fr_285"></span>[3](#fn_283.md) is due to the teachings of Zendō. To
Zendō, therefore, the doctrine of faith became a doctrine involving a
belief in a single Being, without beginning of days or end of life,
unbounded

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

in every [respect](errata.htm#7.md), who, for man's salvation, had become a
man, had accomplished a scheme of salvation, and had returned to his
original glory.

Zendō's biographers relate how, when the patriarch was on the way to
visit Dōshaku, his road lay through forests and mountains, so rough and
impassable that, at last, worn out with fatigue, he had to lie down to
rest in a cave. He was fainting with hunger and weariness, and it was
two days before he could raise himself. Then it seemed to him that a
voice sounded in his ears: "Pull yourself together, and struggle on:
your difficulties will disappear." We may perhaps inquire what these
difficulties were and how they disappeared.

Dōshaku is said to have died in the year A.D. 637. The date cannot be
implicitly trusted, for it is also said that Zendō was twenty-nine years
old when he visited Dōshaku and accepted Amidaism, an impossible age, if
Zendō was born in A.D. 614. The explanation probably will be found in
another statement to the effect that Dōshaku died five years after the
visit of Zendō. That would make Zendō twenty-three years old when he
visited Dōshaku, and we may easily believe that the conversion to
Amidaism, as he came to learn it, may have been a slow process, not
fully accomplished for several years. But, whichever way we look at it,
the conversion of Zendō to the full faith in Amida must have taken place
about the year A.D. 636 (if anything a little later than that year), and
in, or near, the capital city of Singanfu. From that date, and in that
city, he began his preaching activity.

China under the Tang dynasty had many dealings with Central Asia. The
ruling family, as dukes of the dependent principality of Tang, had been
much mixed up with Tartar and Turkish tribes, and it was apparently by
their help that the family had been seated on the throne of China. From
the moment, therefore, that the Dynasty was established, the new Empire
became the cynosure of Central Asian eyes. <span
id="fr_286"></span>[1](#fn_284.md) A Persian mission was sent by Chosroes
II. praying for an alliance, and in 621 the first Zoroastrian temple was
erected in Singanfu. The leader of this mission seems to have been a
Magian of the name of Holu ("le fils du feu," as P. Gaubil calls him),
who was very active in stirring up China against the Mahometans. Of
Manichæans in China proper there seems to be no mention for many years
to come, <span id="fr_287"></span>[2](#fn_285.md) but in 636,

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

almost synchronizing with the commencement of Zendō's preaching
activity, arrived the Nestorian mission under Olopen, which has left
behind it an enduring memorial in stone. Is it possible that the
"difficulties" with which Zendō was troubled, when he lay wearied in the
cave on his way to Dōshaku, were difficulties connected with the
relations between the Buddhist Faith and the Faith which the Nestorians
preached?

We can trace the development of Zendō's thought. Confused by the
multiplexity of the popular Buddhism of his day, he turns to the
scripture in which S’akyamuni is represented as comforting

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vaidehi with the
proximity and tender watchfulness of Amida. Then he goes south of Rozan,
to the remnants of Eon and his White Lotus Guild, after which, in the
solitude of the Goshinji Temple, he works out his problem. In the
meantime he hears of Christianity (by no means an impossibility if we
remember the story of the introduction of silkworms into Europe a
century before). What is he to do or say? He goes to Dōshaku to resolve
his doubts, and Dōshaku tells him of "Eternal Life," and gives him the
Sukhāvati Vyuha, which tells of Amida as a Person who came down upon
Earth, who opened the door of salvation, and has gone to the place He
has prepared for us. <span id="fr_288"></span>[1](#fn_286.md)

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

After 636, then, we find, in Singanfu, two men preaching almost similar
doctrines, the one preaching them in connection with Christ, the other
in connection with Amida. It is further said of Zendō's activity that he
was constantly helped by a mysterious priest who came to visit him every
evening and helped him with his commentaries (see Tada, "Shoshingekōwa,"
p. 359). This mysterious collaborator may have been a Christian, and if
so, the strange coincidences, the almost Pauline echoes, which are
constantly to be found in Zendō's writings, would be amply accounted
for. Nor is the supposition a baseless one; for we have one clear
instance of such collaboration between a Buddhist and Nestorian about a
century later, when the Nestorian priest King Tsing (or Adam, as he is
called on the Singanfu monument) collaborated with the Indian monk
Prajna in the translation of a book on the Six Cardinal Virtues (*Shat
Parāmitā Sutra*). <span id="fr_289"></span>[1](#fn_287.md) The original was
not in Sanskrit, but in the Hu (<span id="img_21900"></span>
![](img/21900.jpg)), *i.e.* the Persian, or, more probably, the Uigur
language. At any rate, not much came of this attempted collaboration,
which probably caused much jealousy and opposition. It was after a while
forbidden by the Emperor Taitsung, who, in a published decree, ordered
the Nestorian King Tsing to confine himself to the teachings of
*Mishiho*, and to leave the followers of S’akyamuni to propagate the
teachings of their master. <span id="fr_290"></span>[2](#fn_288.md)

The suggestion of opposition raised against such collaboration, on the
part of friendly disposed believers of the two religions, by more
strait-laced partisans, brings me to another point of contact between
Zendō and the Nestorians. It is said (my authority again is Mr. Tada)
that great opposition was made against Zendō for his preaching. A
butcher, whose customers had left him to turn

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Buddhists, tried
to murder the persuasive <span id="fr_291"></span>[1](#fn_289.md) monk who
injured his trade. And not only did persons of low degree set themselves
against them. The *literati* persecuted him and his followers, as did
also the priests of the other Buddhist sects. When the Emperor Kaotsung
died in 684, the reins of the Government fell into the hands of the
Empress-Dowager Wu-hu, who was under the influence of a Buddhist monk
named Hwai-yi, a monk of one of the sects opposed to Zendō's teaching,
and Hwai-yi in 694 caused much popular discontent among the lower
classes by burning a favourite temple, which may have been Zendō's. For
the common people heard Zendō gladly, and it was his preaching of a
Gospel to the poor and outcast that annoyed the literati and the
"Salvation-by-knowledge" Schools of Buddhists.

Strange to say, the Nestorians, well received and honourably treated by
Taitsung and Kaotsung, fall into disgrace, and are persecuted, as soon
as Kaotsung's death leaves the supreme power in the hands of the
Empress-Dowager Wu-hu, and her adviser Hwai-yi. The persecution of the
Nestorians is instigated by the same people as that against the
followers of Zendō, and much the same pretexts are alleged. Moreover,
the persecution of the two bodies goes on for the same time, and relief
comes to them simultaneously. Of the Nestorians we read that Huantsung
(723–756), succeeding Wu-hu, rebuilds the "Temple of Felicity," as the
Nestorian Church is called, that Huantsung's successor, Sutsung
(756–763), coming into a disordered inheritance recovers Singanfu which
was in the hands of rebels, and erects "luminous" temples in various
parts of his Empire, and finally that the Emperor Taitsung (763–780),
the same who discouraged the

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

collaboration of King Tsing and Prajnā, not only celebrated the Bon
Festival with the Buddhists in the seventh month, but kept Christmas in
the twelfth with the Nestorians, "burning incense" in a "luminous
temple" with the "luminous multitude." As to Zendō's followers, we find
them gathering round a teacher named Ekan, not very long after the
master's death. Ninety years after that event, a monk named Hossō is
mentioned as acquiring great fame, and in 793 Shōkō makes Uryūsan (<span
id="img_22100"></span> ![](img/22100.jpg)) the headquarters of the
teachings promulgated by Zendō. But by that time the Emperor Taitsung
was already dead (ob. 780), and the collaboration between Amidaist and
Christian had already been prohibited.

When the Nestorian mission first arrived in China in A.D. 636, they
procured from the Emperor Teitsung a decree authorizing the erection of
a *Tatsin* (*i.e.* a Syrian) temple. This name, however, may have led to
confusion, for both Zoroastrians and Manichæans might conceivably have
claimed the title (loosely construed), and in fact did so. When
Huantsung, soon after 713, rebuilds the Nestorian Church, it is called a
"Temple of Felicity." When Sutsung, in 756, recovers Singanfu, the
Nestorian Churches are "luminous (<span id="img_22101"></span>
![](img/22101.jpg)) temples," and this name has come to be identified
with Nestorianism ever since, both in China and Japan.

When Zendō died, the Emperor Kaotsung (650–683) granted to the temple in
which he resided the honorific title of Kōmyōji (<span
id="img_22102"></span> ![](img/22102.jpg)), which is only another form
of "luminous temple." The popular explanation of this name is obviously
a fanciful one. Bright rays of light do not come out of the mouths of
even the most eloquent preachers of any faith, nor do books, however
holy and mouldy, glow with a phosphorescent light. Yet that was what
Shōkō is said to have seen issuing from the works of Zendō preserved in
the library at the White Horse Monastery. <span
id="fr_292"></span>[1](#fn_290.md) Kaotsung was an enlightened monarch, and
if he gave the title of Kōmyōji, it must have been for the quality of
the doctrine and not by reason of any doubtful miracle. But it is quite
probable that "luminous temple" and *Kōmyōji* may have been used as
alternative titles to describe the Faith in One Saviour as taught, both
by the Nestorians and the children of Zendō, during the period of
collaboration, and that later, when Taitsung ordered the two to keep
apart, the name of Kōmyōji was taken by the Buddhist section

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

of the "movement" as their own specific designation, the Manichæans
distinguishing their temple by the title *Dai-un-kōmyōji*.

This view receives considerable support from Japanese history. Shōtoku
Taishi, whom the Shinshu honour as the first of their *Zenchishiki* or
Saints, died in 621, shortly after the commencement of the Tang Dynasty.
Buddhism was, therefore, in full swing in Japan when, in 636, the
Nestorian Mission arrived at Singanfu, and Zendō began his preaching,
and there were many Japanese students being sent yearly to China for
purposes of study. <span id="fr_293"></span>[1](#fn_291.md) Not only so,
but there were many Chinese families residing in Japan and naturalized
there (*ayabito*), and it has been noticed that most of Kōtoku Tennō's
Taikwa Reforms (A.D. 645–654) were worked out for him by these
*ayabito*. <span id="fr_294"></span>[2](#fn_292.md) The whole of the Nara
period was an age in which Japan was peculiarly sensitive to Chinese
influences, and especially to the influences of Chinese Buddhism.

This influence seems to have reached its maximum during the reign of
Shōmu Tennō (724–748) and his Consort Kōmyō Kōgō (the very name, a
posthumous one, is in itself significant). Shōmu Tennō was a very
zealous Buddhist. He founded hospitals and charitable institutions, and
his Empress distinguished herself by personally undertaking the nursing
of lepers <span id="fr_295"></span>[3](#fn_293.md)—a truly Christian work.
Japan was in no position at the time to undertake hospital work unaided.
Foreign doctors had to be employed, and the industry of Japanese
students has recently shown us the presence in Japan, at the Court, of a
Nestorian Christian (the Nestorian Christians were famous all

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

over the East for their skill in medicine). <span
id="fr_296"></span>[1](#fn_294.md) Here, therefore, we have possibly two
instances of simultaneous collaboration, Buddhist and Christian uniting
in the production of books in China, and in works of charity in Japan.

In 781, the Singanfu monument is erected, and shortly before, or
afterwards, the Chinese Emperor finds reason for prohibiting the
collaboration. In 782 the Emperor Kwammu comes to the throne of Japan.
The Buddhists have been giving themselves airs for some time, and the
ambitious priest Dōkyō, intriguing with the Empress Shōtoku (765–769),
has assumed the title of Hō Ō, or "religious emperor," a kind of pope!
Kwammu determines to put an end to the political intrigues of the Nara
clergy, removes his capital to Kyoto, and sends Kōbō and Dengyo to China
to investigate religion. They come back, the one with the Shingon, the

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

other with the Tendai. Again it is significant that these sects, and
especially the Tendai, which became practically the State religion of
Japan for many centuries, were the very sects which had organized the
persecution against Zendō, when he first began to preach his doctrine of
Salvation by Faith in Amida.

But the light still shone, in spite of the opposition of the Tendai.
Zendō's books came over to Japan, Mr. Tada tells us, at different times
between 796 and 858, and several monks, such as Kūya and Eikwan, kept
alive the faith in Amida, invoking His Name on Hieizan, or wandering,
disguised as travelling priests or horsedealers (*umakata*), from
province to province, preaching a simple faith to country
peasants. <span id="fr_297"></span>[1](#fn_295.md) And finally, the great
Hōnen (Genial), breaking with the Tendai, as so many others had done, in
order to return to the teaching of Zendō, founds at Kurodani a temple,
still known as *Konkai Kōmyōji*, "the Illustrious Temple of the Golden
Precept," which is to this day one of the chief seats of the Chinsei
sub-division of the Jōdo sect. And it is this Chinsei-ha which preserves
Zendō's rule of making the Nembutsu an invocation of the Great Amida
alone, to the exclusion of all the rest.

actually the capital of Japan only from 710 to 784, there having been no

people and to the State. Your father had a great aversion to them, and
you must not displease him by calling on them on my behalf." She
requested to be buried with great simplicity, exhorting her son to
associate with good men and to avoid extravagance, especially in hunting
and building.

from a certain Potolik, King of Fulin. Professor Hirth gives reason for
saying that Potolik = Patriarch, and that Fulin is to be pronounced as
Pat-lam, the birthplace of Christ being taken as = to Christendom, just
as Magadha to the Chinese stood for India.

That the Nestorian mission was as much political as religious may e seen
in the fact that an *Olopen* (was it a name or a title?) visited the
court of the great Indian ruler Siladitya Harsha in 636. It is clear
that the Nestorians, making common cause with their Persian protectors
and friends, were actively engaged in trying to procure allies for them
in their warfare against the Arabian invaders. Many Nestorian dioceses
were destroyed when the Arabs annexed Merv, Balkh, Herat, etc., in A.D.
644. Hiouen Thsang, the Chinese traveller, was also in India at the
time, returning to China in A.D. 645. It is also noteworthy that from
this date both Siladitya Harsha and Taitsung now become more favourable
to Buddhism. Neumann ("Asiatische Studien," i. 166) quotes, out of a
Chinese work published about A.D. 502, a description of Persia, in which
it is stated that there were many Buddhist temples in the Persian
capital. Buddhist survivals are still to be traced in the doctrines of
the Shiite, and still more so in those of the Sufite, sect of
Mahometanism. It is quite probable that both Zoroastrianism and
Manichæism were looked upon as legitimate variants of Buddhism. There
were Nestorians in China before Olopen—some are mentioned as early as
A.D. 508.

us the best contemporary picture we possess of Buddhist India. If it
were not for him and the other Chinese pilgrims; who visited India, we
should know nothing of the history of that country for several
centuries. Hiouen Thsang, in addition to his own contributions to the
theology of Buddhism, brought back the materials with which the purely
Chinese sects, such as *Tendai* and *Kegon* (Avataṃsaka), were
afterwards established.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[197:2](chj21.htm#fr_245.md) *Sōzu*, a Japanese
ecclesiastical title equivalent to our canon or archdeacon. The
lawlessness and want of discipline among the monks, whose numbers were
very large owing to the indiscriminate patronage of the faith by devotee
sovereigns during this period, gave rise to many attempts to regulate
the Buddhist clergy by the appointment of overseers or superintendents.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[198:1](chj21.htm#fr_246.md) There were actually
*four* strains of the Hossō in Japan.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[198:2](chj21.htm#fr_247.md) *Gyōgi Bosatsu*, a
celebrated Korean priest (670–749), who enjoyed great influence in
Japan. It was he who administered Baptism (Kwanjo) to the reigning
emperor.

<span id="fn_246"></span>[198:3](chj21.htm#fr_248.md) *Ryōbu Shinto*, an
amalgamation of Buddhism and Shinto, which was not done away with
officially until the beginning of the Meiji period.

One of the natural consequences of the adoption of the system known as
*Ryōbu* ("two parts") was that, by treating the native gods of Japan as
merely incarnations of one or other of the Buddhas, and as therefore
entitled to the worship of the Buddhists, the Japanese were enabled to
introduce into their Buddhism many non-Buddhist elements. Thus Amida
and. Vairoc’ana, both of them symbolized by the Sun, came to be
identified with *Tenshōkōdaijin*, the "Heaven-shining-mighty goddess,"
from whom the Imperial house claims descent. (The change of sex is
unimportant, for many of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, *e.g.* Kwannon,
are bisexual.) Thus, too, Buddhism, which absolutely forbids the taking
of life, gained a Buddhified god of war in Hachiman, and Buddhist monks,
who worshipped the god of war, could with quiet consciences take to
fighting. Nichiren ("Seigoroku," p. 132) speaks of Tenshōdaijin and
Hachiman as the true lords of Japan, revealed in later times as Buddhas,
and Hideyoshi, who openly avowed his desire for deification, built for
himself a temple in which he intended to be worshipped after his death
as Shin Hachiman, the new god of war.

<span id="fn_247"></span>[199:1](chj21.htm#fr_249.md) For this, see the,
chapter on *Hossō* in vol. i. of "Bukkyō Kakushū Kōyō."

<span id="fn_248"></span>[200:1](chj21.htm#fr_250.md) It is interesting to
note how the different schools of the Mahāyāna nearly all present us
with a Triad or Trinity. Between this Trinity of Locana, Maitreya,
Manjuśri, and the Pure-land Trinity of Amitābha, Avalokites’vara, and
Mahāsthāmaprāpta there is only a difference of names. The concepts are
identical.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[201:1](chj21.htm#fr_251.md) Nichiren (see
"Sei-go-roku," *passim*)) was very scathing in his denunciation of this
spurious oracle, as he termed it. Nichirenism had no official connection
with Ryōbu, and yet, on occasions, it too would turn to Hachiman and
Tenshōdaijin.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[201:2](chj21.htm#fr_252.md) *Miwa* is a town in
Yamato, with a well-known Shinto temple. The oracle is mentioned by Dr.
Murakami on p. 859 of his handbook.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[201:3](chj21.htm#fr_253.md) Most of the present
funeral customs of Japan date from the Nara period. Strange to say, most
of them imply the continuance of the soul after death. This is
absolutely contrary to the original doctrines of Buddhism; but the
Japanese belief in immortality was too deeply engrained to be easily
eradicated.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[202:1](chj21.htm#fr_254.md) See Nanjo, No. 87.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[202:2](chj21.htm#fr_255.md) The list of
Avatamsaka Sūtras given by Nanjo gives us some data for fixing the age
of Nāgārjuna. One of the chapters was translated by Lokaraksha of the
Han Dynasty who reached Loyang in A.D. 147. It would follow that
Nāgārjuna must have lived before that date. Again, all Buddhist
authorities in Japan place him 600 years after the Parinirvana. If we
fix that at about 500 B.C. we get Nāgārjuna's date about 100 A.D., which
agrees very well both with the translation of the chapter by Lokaraksha
and with the year assigned by Eusebius and other writers for the
*terminus a quo* of Gnosticism.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[203:1](chj21.htm#fr_256.md) Nanjo, "Cat. of
Tripitaka," Nos. 87, 88.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[203:2](chj21.htm#fr_257.md) Mr. G. Sakurai, in
the now defunct *Hansei Zasshi*, vol. xiii. p. 12, says that in A.D. 781
one of the Indian translators of the Tang period, Prajnã by name, who
had come to China in order to get near the scene of Manjuśri's labours,
was actually collaborating with the Nestorian priest King Ching, or
Adam, the man who erected the Singanfu monument. Between them they made
a translation of the "Shatparāmitā Sūtra," which they offered to the
Emperor Tetsung. The Emperor, however, refused to receive it, saying
that King Ching should devote himself to preaching the doctrines of
*Meshiho* (Messiah), leaving the Buddhists to propagate the teachings of
S’akyamuni. The book therefore appears in Prajnã's name only.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[203:3](chj21.htm#fr_258.md) Vairoc’ana is said to
be distinct from the Roshana of the Hossō, though in practice he is
almost always identified with him. I have drawn my materials from the
chapters on Hossū and Kegon in "Bukkyō Kakushū Kōyō," vol. i.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[204:1](chj21.htm#fr_259.md) It is very
interesting to trace chronologically the workings of the different
Buddhist sects in the early years of Japanese Buddhism. Of the rival
Trinities, the first to reach Japan is undoubtedly that which has
Amitābha as its central figure. A century later comes the Trinity of
Roshana, and still later again that of Vairoc’ana. For a while
syncretism prevails, and an attempt is made to treat the three as
identical. Geshin is the first to see that this syncretism is
impossible. Finally, Hōnen and Shinran, in the twelfth century, get the
courage of their convictions, and proclaim Amida as the True and only
Refuge of the Buddhist believer.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[204:2](chj21.htm#fr_260.md) I would call the
attention of the European reader to the very suggestive work "Le Japon,"
by M. de la Mazelière, of which, I believe, three volumes have appeared.
The author brings out very clearly the <span id="page_205">p. 205</span>
points of Japan's indebtedness to China and India for the materials of
much of her religious thought.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[205:1](chj21.htm#fr_261.md) The practice of
reckoning time by certain periods of years arbitrarily fixed from time
to time, for the purpose of worrying the historian, had been long in
vogue in China. Kōtoku introduced it in Japan, and there have been over
240 such periods since that time.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[205:2](chj21.htm#fr_262.md) The Ōmi and Ōmuraji
were in ancient times the ministers of the Emperor. The offices were
hereditary. The new offices were not so in intention, but the Japanese
is an oligarch by constitution, and the new offices gradually came to be
monopolized by certain families.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[206:1](chj21.htm#fr_263.md) That is the Buddhist
version. It is claimed by Soga's enemies that he, true to family
traditions, was aspiring to the crown.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[206:2](chj21.htm#fr_264.md) To estimate the
greatness of this aristocratic family, which has supplied such a long
list of imperial consorts, the student is referred to the pages devoted
to the subject in Fr. Papinot's "Dictionnaire d’Histoire et de
Géographie du Japon."

<span id="fn_263"></span>[206:3](chj21.htm#fr_265.md) For the Taihōryō, see
*Transactions Asiatic Society of Japan*, vol. viii. p. 145.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[206:4](chj21.htm#fr_266.md) Of the "Kojiki" there
is a translation by Chamberlain (*Asiatic Society of Japan*, vol. x.,
Supp.); of the "Nihongi," one in English by Aston (Japan Society,
London, Supp. I.); and one in German by Florenz (*Mitteilungen der
deutschen Gesellschaft für Natur and Völkerkunde Ostasiens*. Tokyo).

<span id="fn_265"></span>[207:1](chj21.htm#fr_267.md) See, *e.g.*, vol. i.
of Murdoch's "History of Japan."

<span id="fn_266"></span>[207:2](chj21.htm#fr_268.md) I specially notice
this particular instance, because the mention of venison seems to
connect it with the deer Jātaka, which reappears in Christian folklore
as the legend of St. Eustathius, and afterwards as that of St. Hubert.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[208:1](chj21.htm#fr_269.md) The Sui dynasty ruled
in China from 589–619 A.D. They came to power at the close of a long
period of division, the Empire having been previously divided into many
small kingdoms, with Chinese rulers south of the Yangtse, and Tartar or
Turkish chieftains in the northern districts. Such were the Wei
(Tartars), the Hsia (Hun), the Northern Yen (Tartar), the Western Liang
(Turkish), and the Western Tsin  (Thibetan). These smaller kingdoms are
of great importance in the History of Buddhism, for it was in them
rather than in China proper that Buddhism flourished before the Tang
period. The Sui family had but two Sovereigns—Wenti (589–606), who
united China and carried the Chinese name far among the Turks in the
North and East; and Yangti (605–617), a man of violent temper, prone to
debauchery and extravagance, who brought the Empire to the verge of
ruin. He was overthrown by Li-yüan of the Tang family, who ascended the
throne in A.D. 618, as Kaotsu.

<span id="fn_268"></span>[209:1](chj21.htm#fr_270.md) It will be well to
remember that under the earlier Tang Emperors, Chinese Viceroyalties
extended as far as the frontiers of the Persian Empire, and that even
monarchs like Siladitya Harsha of Kanauj acknowledged Chinese influence.
It must also be remembered that Kaotsu suppressed Buddhist monasteries,
sending 100,000 bonzes and nuns about their business, being stimulated
thereto by petitions from Chinese literati. Buddhism had many enemies:
*e.g.* in India, where Harsha's predecessor had likewise (in 601)
dissolved the Buddhist monasteries, and even uprooted the famous
Bodhi-tree. V. A. Smith, "Early History of India."

<span id="fn_269"></span>[209:2](chj21.htm#fr_271.md) It will be well to
keep a few dates in mind. The first Persian Temple (whether Zoroastrian
or Manichæan is not quite clear) was erected at Singanfu, in 621, three
years after Kaotsu's accession. The Persian Empire, under Chosroes II.,
was at the time at war with Rome (or rather Constantinople), a Persian
army was on the Bosphorus. This war was a great strain on the Persian
dominions, and there were other causes for anxiety. Mahomet, born 570,
had announced himself as a prophet in 610, and the Hejira, from which
all Mahometans date their years, took place in 622. Siladitya Harsha,
whose Indian Empire extended over the whole basin of the Ganges, and who
began as a warlike monarch, came to the throne A.D. 606. He, too,
received an Embassy from the Persians, which he housed in a monastery
near Multan, and massacred after entertaining them liberally. This must
have been before his conversion to Buddhism, which seems to have been
about 645 (V. A. Smith," Early History of India"). The Persians were
evidently looking everywhere for helpful allies.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[209:3](chj21.htm#fr_272.md) Shōtoku Taishi's
political activity may be said to have begun with <span id="page_210">p.
210</span> the battle of Shikisen in 587, when the Shinto supporters
were crushed. He became Crown Prince in 593, proclaimed Buddhism in 595,
promulgated his Constitution of 17 Articles in 604, sent his celebrated
letter to the "Emperor of the West" (Yangti of Sui) in 609, and died in
621. With him may be said to end the Korean period of Japanese Buddhism.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[210:1](chj21.htm#fr_273.md) Korea, divided into
several small states, was fluctuating in allegiance between China and
Japan. Yangti of Sui sent an expedition to Korea (A.D. 615), and Shōtoku
was much concerned to preserve Japanese influence in the peninsula.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[210:2](chj21.htm#fr_274.md) With a few
exceptions, the early books translated by the Buddhist missionaries of
the Han period (ended A.D. 220) and of the era of confusion which
followed, were so badly done as to be practically unintelligible.
Kumarajīva, a native of Karachar, with apparently both Chinese and
Indian blood in his veins, arrived at Changan in A.D. 406, and
inaugurated a new era of translation. Amongst the books of which he
provided fresh translations were the Sukhāvati Vyūhas and the Hokekyō.
Kum, therefore marks a new period in the history of the Chinese
Buddhism.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[210:3](chj21.htm#fr_275.md) Not even with
Kumarajīva's efforts could Buddhism in China be brought into a
satisfactory condition. Bodhidharma's efforts were devoted to
introducing a form of Buddhism which should not depend upon books, but
teach men by contemplation to get straight to the Heart of Buddha.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[211:1](chj21.htm#fr_276.md) Hiouen Thsang, born
A.D. 602, enters the Order 622, about the time of Kaotsu's edict against
the monasteries; unable to satisfy his mind, starts for India, 629,
meets Silabhadra in India and enters the Nalanda monastery in 638,
returns to China 645. The Emperor Teitsung writes a preface for his
translation in 648. Hiouen Thsang is regarded as the founder of the
Hosso sect, and it shows how close was the connection between Japan and
China that the same sect appears in Japan 653, having been brought over
by Dōshō, a student under Hiouen Thsang. It is noteworthy that H. T. did
not bring Amidaism of the Zendō type back from India. Perhaps he did not
find it there.

Ostasiens," vol. ii. p. 659.

"Shōshingekōwa," p. 347.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[212:2](chj21.htm#fr_279.md) The Kwangyō, which is
the second longest of the three Jōdo books, was not translated into
Chinese until A.D. 424, its translator being Kalayasas, a contemporary
of Kumārajiva. The Larger Sukhāvati Vyūha was translated as early as
A.D. 147, by Anshikao and also by one of his companions, there being two
later translations, one in 252 by Sanghavarman, and one of the Smaller
Sukh. Vy. by Kumārajiva about 420. This would seem to point to the fact
that Eon's teaching must have been based entirely on the earlier
translations of the Larger Sukhāvati Vyūha, if, indeed, it was based on
the present Amida books at all. Eon's spiritual father was Dōan (d.
390), a native of Ch’angshan in Chekiang, who moved to Jōyō (<span
id="img_21200"></span> ![](img/21200.jpg)), where he was besieged and
taken prisoner by a king named Fu Ken (<span id="img_21201"></span>
![](img/21201.jpg)), who ruled over one of the Central Asian
principalities. During Dōan's lifetime, the Tsin Emperor Hiao-wu-ti was
converted to Buddhism, chiefly owing [to](errata.htm#5.md) Tangut
influences. Dōan professed to have the aid of Pindola (Jap. Bindzuru),
and was devoted to all the Buddhas, though perhaps especially to Amida,
as may be inferred from his nickname *Miten no Dōan*, "Doan of Mida's
Heaven." Eon, who followed him, seems to have been entirely devoted to
Amida, as was also the Society which ho founded, and which, there is
some reason to suppose, was Manichæan. In the lifetime of Eon and Man
began the streams of Chinese pilgrims to India, Fahian being the first.
It is noteworthy that none of these pilgrims seem to have brought back
anything definite about Amida from India. This is especially noticeable
in the case of Hiouen Thsang, and it seems to point to the Central Asian
origin of the Amida cult.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[213:1](chj21.htm#fr_280.md) It is said of Eon
that he was so strict in his observance of [Buddhist](errata.htm#6.md)
discipline that when, on his deathbed, he was ordered to take honey, he
first set his pupils to find out whether the Buddhist rule permitted it.
While they were still examining, he died. Once he broke his rule of
retirement by mistake, being so engrossed in conversation that he
inadvertently went outside the bounds of his hermitage. This is a
favourite theme for artists. We may here mention another theme,
frequently found in Buddhist pictures, which may be called the "Narrow
Way." A pilgrim, pursued by wild beasts, demons, and evil spirits,
arrives at the edge of a precipice. In front of him are two lakes, the
one of water, filled with sharks and other monsters of the deep, the
other of fire and peopled with devils. Between the two is <span
id="page_214">p. 214</span> a very narrow strip of precipitous rock,
necessitating the wariest of walking, the first false step meaning
instant destruction on the one side or the other. It is dark; but on the
other side of the narrow pathway stands Amida, who has accomplished
salvation. A ray of light issues from him, and the legend above him is
*Namu Amide Butsu*, which Zendō taught men to translate "Trust ME, for I
will save you"—the meaning of the word *Jesus*, but not that of the
Buddhist legend.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[214:1](chj21.htm#fr_281.md) The *Chow* \[circ.
560) were a northern Kingdom, a rival, of the Wei, whose territories and
powers they gradually usurped.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[214:2](chj21.htm#fr_282.md) *Donran* died in 533.
Like all the Amidaists, he was not a pure Chinaman, but a subject of one
of the small northern kingdoms. Wu-ti, of the Liang, *circ*. A.D. 528,
was a great admirer of Donran's. It is interesting to note that shortly
after Donran's death, within the lifetime both of Dōshaku and Zendō, an
attempt was made (the forerunner of the Ryobu Shinto in Japan) to
amalgamate Buddhism with Taoism). I quote it to show that this was an
age of syncretic aspirations, Donran may almost have been a contemporary
of Vasubhandhu. Some trace of the tendency to make common cause with
Taoism may be perhaps found in the syllable Dō (<span
id="img_21404"></span> ![](img/21404.jpg)) in the assumed names of
*Dōan*, or *Dōshaku*. Donran was certainly a Taoist before becoming a
Buddhist. The *Dō* in Zendō's name is slightly different (<span
id="img_21405"></span> ![](img/21405.jpg)), as though to emphasize some
new principle that had come into his teaching.

Genkū and Shinran, notably the *Yūdzūnembutsu* and *Ji* sects,
concerning whom a note will be given later on in this chapter.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[216:2](chj21.htm#fr_287.md) Acc. to the authors
of *Mem. Conc. la Chine* (see xvi. 227, also <span id="page_217">p.
217</span> Kaeuffer, ii. 663) the first mention of *Moni* or Manichæan
monks among the Tartar tribes occurs in 786. I am indebted to my friend
Mr. S. Tachibana for the following data concerning the Manichæans, which
somewhat modify these statements. In the fifth year of the Jōkwan (Chih
Kwan) period of the Tang dynasty, *i.e.* A.D. 632, a Manichæan named
Boku-go-ka-roku obtained from the Emperor Taitsung permission to erect a
Tatsin Temple (Jap. *Taishinji*) at Singanfu. Tatsin was a generic name
for Persia and Syria, and the name Taishinji was at first applied
indifferently to all temples, Christian, Manichæan, or Zoroastrian,
devoted to the propagation of faiths coming from those regions. In 734,
the Emperor Hiüan Tsung ordered the destruction of all Manichæan Temples
(probably of all Tatsin Temples), and forbade the promulgation of
Manichæanism. In 746, the same emperor removed the prohibition and
ordered that all temples belonging to religions of Persian nationality
should be called Taishinji, whether in the two capitals or in the
neighbouring country districts. In the third year of Daireki (Chin.
Ta-lai), *i.e.* 768, Taitsung authorized Persian subjects to erect *Dai
Un Kōmyōji* (<span id="img_21700"></span> ![](img/21700.jpg)), evidently
as something distinct from the [Taishinji](errata.htm#8.md), also as
distinct from Buddhism. Again, in the third year of the Emperor Wutsung,
A.D. 843, all Manichæan Temples were closed and many of their priests,
nuns, and laity put to death or sent into exile. In the meantime the
Kōmyō doctrine had reached Japan. It had been brought to China in the
reign of the Empress *Wu*, in the first year of Yen Tsai, in 694 by a
Persian of the name of *Pu-ta-tan* (<span id="img_21701"></span>
![](img/21701.jpg)). The Empress Jito was then on the throne. She was a
zealous Buddhist. In the year 692, she received from the Chinese
Ambassador a statue of Amida, and copies of a Sūtra called *Son Kōmyō
Kyō*, which she caused to be preached throughout her empire. It is
difficult not to connect this with the Faith that Zendō had preached.
(Mr. Tachibana quotes from *Bussotōki*, fasc. 39–42. See also Haas,
"Annalen des Japanischen Buddhismus," p. 318, and Dévéria, *Journal
Asiatique*, ix.–x. p. 445).

<span id="fn_286"></span>[218:1](chj21.htm#fr_288.md) I would like to call
attention to an excellent article entitled the "Mystery of Fulin," by
Dr. Hirth, of Columbia, which has just appeared in vol. xxx., part 1, of
the *Journal of the Am. Oriental Society*. Dr. Hirth has long maintained
(and gives reasons for so doing) that this embassy came from the
Patriarch of Antioch as head of the Nestorian Church. There is also a
great deal of information in Mrs. Gordon's recent work on the Messiah, a
book which, despite its superabundant mysticism, is full of valuable
information and most suggestive in the many hints and indications it
gives for further investigation and research. It is interesting to
observe that Olopen and his missionaries emphasize the fact that they
come, not from the King of Persia or any political power, but from the
Patriarch of Antioch, a purely spiritual personage with no political
influence at all. Perhaps they did this on purpose to avoid being mixed
up with Manichæans and Zoroastrians, who were more closely connected
with the Persian State. Dr. Grierson, in his article on Bhakti-marga, in
vol. ii. of Hasting's "Encyclopedia of Religions," shows us the same
Olopen, three years later, in India, at the Court of Siladitya Harsha,
whore he is well received. This will show us how Nestorianism was at
work, quietly and unobtrusively, in India as in China. We know that
there were Christians in China before Olopen, for the Emperor Justinian
(527–565) received a present of silkworms brought to him by monks who
had been living for some years either in Singanfu or in Nanking, These
missionaries can scarcely have been Nestorians, seeing that Justinian
had a great dislike to that body of Christians. On the Singanfu
monument, erected 781, Olopen is described as Daitoku (<span
id="img_21800"></span> ![](img/21800.jpg)). In the year 771, the Emperor
Taitsung appointed ten Daitoku, men of recognized virtue and merit. The
erectors of the monument would scarcely have ventured to give Olopen
this title unless it had been (posthumously perhaps) conferred on him by
the Emperor (see Murakami, *op. cit.*, p. 804; and E. A. Parker, "Notes
on the Nestorians," *J.R.A.S*, North China Branch, vol. xxiv. p. 297).

<span id="fn_287"></span>[219:1](chj21.htm#fr_289.md) It is to be found in
the Buddhist Canon. See Nanjo's Catalogue, No. 1004.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[219:2](chj21.htm#fr_290.md) Prof. Takakusu called
attention to Prajna in his Translation of I-Tsing's "Record of the
Buddhist Religion," (Oxford, 1896). *Mishiho* is Messiah. Among the Jews
in Kaifongfu, in Honan, are preserved portions of the prophets Zechariah
and Malachi. A phrase which Zendō uses more than once is *Fushi Sōgō*,
"the turning of the hearts of parents and children to one another," a
phrase which at once suggests Malachi to the mind. Zendō's phrase was
later made the title of the well-known Japanese Jōdo book, the *Fushi
Sōgō*. I am much indebted to Dr. Haas, of Heidelberg, for calling my
attention to this matter.

<span id="fn_289"></span>[220:1](chj21.htm#fr_291.md) Tada says that
Zendō's preaching was so persuasive that many of his hearers committed
suicide by burning themselves alive. Mr. Tada rightly feels called upon
to apologize for this; but no student of the Hokekyō will need to be
reminded that to make a holocaust of oneself is set forth in the Hokekyō
as the highest form of grateful adoration. But the word "holocaust" is
also a good Christian expression, spiritually interpreted, and I venture
to suggest that the holocausts in Zendō's time may have been of this
kind. I am encouraged to think this by the fact that in the short
biography of Zendō which appears in *Shinshu Seikun*, the word *nyūjō*
(<span id="img_22000"></span> ![](img/22000.jpg)) is used to describe
the occurrence. *Nyūjō* literally means "to enter into the state of
determination," though Hepburn in his Dictionary, explains it as meaning
voluntary suicide by fire.

I am much indebted to this work. I have already shown, in notes on
Hiouen Thsang and the Manichees, how quickly Japan, at this particular
period, was moved by any new religious movement in the capital of the
Tangs.

pp. 145–6. A little point, worthy of remark, is the following. In 639,
Olopen, having established his missionaries at Singanfu, goes on to
India and visits the court of Siladitya Harsha, at Kanauj. Shortly after
this, wo read of Harsha's zeal for works of charity, leper hospitals,
etc., institutions which Buddhism had scarcely known since the days of
As’oka, but which have constantly been a conspicuous element in all
Christian work. In Japan, what I may call the *Kōmyō* doctrines find
their way into the country under Jitō and Mommu (637–697). Here also
they are followed by a period of enthusiasm for works of charity which
continues for a while, until the tares spring up and choke the good
seed, and the Tendai, the ancient enemies of Zendō, get the upper hand.

<span id="fn_294"></span>[223:1](chj21.htm#fr_296.md) The following are the
data known about the Nestorian doctor Rimitsu. In the year A.D. 739
there arrived from China a ship-load of distinguished persons. (1) Kibi
Mabi, who had been studying in China since 716, and who brought back
with him the art of embroidery, the game of *go*, the *biwa*, and the
Katakana alphabet. (2) Dōsen, the founder in Japan of the Kegon (or
Avatamsaka) sect. (3) A Brahman priest, Bodhisena, from India. (4) A
musician named Fat Triet (Buttetsu) from Cambodia; and (5) a Nestorian
physician of Persian nationality named Rimitsu. The party were received
on behalf of the Government by Gyogi, at Naniwa, and Gyogi was able to
display his learning by conversing with the Indian Brahman in Sanskrit.
A month later, a member of the Japanese Embassy in China returned to
Japan with three Chinese and another Persian. The whole party were taken
to court and the Emperor conferred official rank upon them, especial
mention being made of Ritōho, a Chinaman, and Rimitsu. In 736 Shōmu was
in the midst of his hospital schemes, and Rimitsu was evidently a
distinguished physician. The Japanese must have been very different from
what they are now if they neglected the opportunity of sucking his
brains! Mr. Tachibana, who has furnished me with the materials for this
note, bases his information on an article by Dr. Takakusu in
"Shigakuzasshi," vol. iii. No. 7, and on Dr. Kume's "History of the Nara
Epoch." That Rimitsu was a Christian was shown some time ago by Mr.
Saeki. Ho could not have been a Manichæan, seeing that the Manichæans
discouraged doctors.

Gyogi Bosatsu was the spiritual director of Sharma and his Empress
Kōmyō. He was an advocate of Kōmyō doctrines, very practical, very
charitable. He was a syncretist, and first originated the Ryōbu doctrine
in Japan, stimulated thereto by the example of the Buddhists and Taoists
in China.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[224:1](chj21.htm#fr_297.md) It is said of Zendō
that he and his disciples were much given to itinerant preaching. So
were the Nestorians. The Greek merchant Cosmas Indicopleustes, who was
in India A.D. 535, mentions a Nestorian order of itinerant preachers
named Periodeutæ, or wanderers, who were busy in his days evangelizing
in N. W. India. Olopen himself. may have been one; we find him in China
and then in India. It is possible that Kūya and Eikwan may have been
itinerant preachers after this type, having learned the value of it from
Zendō. So also may have been the mysterious personage who, in 1095,
appeared to Ryonin, the founder of the Yūdzūnembutsu, and told him of
the "One man that stood for all men, and the one religious act that
embraced all others." Ippen (1239–1239), the founder of the Ji Sect,
wandered in his allegiance from the Tendai to the Seizanha of the Jōdo,
and finally founded a sect of his own. He was a great student of Zendō,
both as a teacher and as an artist, and his sect was intended to be a
reproduction of Zendō's teachings. His nickname was Yūgyō Shōnin, "the
itinerating preacher," and to this day, the head of the Ji sect is
supposed to be always travelling about the country preaching.
