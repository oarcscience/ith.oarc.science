### CHAPTER VII

<span class="smallcaps">Alexandria and Antioch at the Time of
Christ</span>

<span class="smallcaps">There</span> are two words which connect the
Japanese Mahāyāna, in one of its many aspects, with the Gnosticism of
Alexandria and Antioch, and through it with the Christianity of the
Apostolic age. These words are *Abraxas* and *Caulaucau*.

I have already, in a previous chapter, spoken of Alexandria and Antioch,
of their mixed populations, of the extent of their commercial relations
with Central Asia and India, and of the fact of As’oka's emissaries
having been sent to both these cities during the course of the third
century B.C. It is not necessary for me to repeat what I said then. What
is of present importance is that these two cities, the two organs, so to
speak, through which the commerce between Asia and Europe was
effectuated in the early days of the Roman Empire, were the native homes
of that syncretic miscellany of religious ideas, known as Gnosticism.
Alexandrian Gnosticism is connected with the name of Basilides, <span
id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75) that of Antioch (or, rather, Syria.md) with
Valentinus. <span id="fr_76"></span>[2](#fn_76.md)

Gnosticism is derived from the Greek *gnosis*, which is identical in
meaning with the word *Bodhi*, from which we get *Buddha*, "the
Enlightened One," and it is akin, both etymologically and in
signification, with the word *Prajnā* (Jap. *Hannya*), "Knowledge." The
first of these Sanskrit

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

words, personified and used in the singular, has supplied Mahāyānism
with its nearest approach to the idea of God, such as we know Him,
"above all, in all, through all"; the second, likewise personified, in
that vague manner which the Mahāyāna delights to use, has been
identified with Nature, with the Hindu goddess Prithivī, with the spirit
which animates the Kosmos, the "universal Pan."

The Gnostics, like the Mahāyānists, claimed to have the key of wisdom or
knowledge, and, like them, tried to interpret the various religions of
the world, with the help of the key which was in their hands. There
seems to be no doubt that the fact of Christ was the impulse which
spurred them to activity; it is equally certain that the outward form of
Gnosticism varied according to the country in which it made its
appearance. It is this that makes Gnosticism such an extremely puzzling
subject to the student of philosophy and religion.

Gnosticism, like Proteus, claimed to be "thrice excellent;" it "knew not
only things to come, but even things past as well as present;" it had
great "skill in divination;" "it was (or claimed to be) the messenger
and interpreter of all antiquities and hidden mysteries." But it was at
liberty, nevertheless, "to turn itself into all manner of forms and
wonders of nature." <span id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_77.md) The underlying
matter was always the same; the form differed from a country to country
and from age to age. The Mahāyāna exhibits a precisely similar Protean
power of assuming the most varied shapes.

The existence of Buddhism in Alexandria has often been suspected.
Scholars have seen Buddhists in the communities of the Essenes in
Palestine, in the monastic j, congregations of the Therapeutæ described
by Philo, in the Hermetic books of Egypt, and especially in the κορὴ
κόσμου,

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

preserved for us by Stobæus. The identity of these with Buddhism has
never been clearly established. It has also been often suspected that
Gnosticism was derived from Buddhism. Again, the identity has never been
clearly established, possibly because Western scholars have devoted
their attention almost exclusively to the Hīnayāna Buddhism of Ceylon
and the Pali books. It would not readily occur to any one to look for
traces of Egyptian Gnosticism in remote Japan. Yet there can be little
doubt that the system known in Japan as the Shingon, and introduced into
that country about A.D. 804, by the celebrated Kōbō Daishi, must be
looked upon as a system which is not Indian in its origin, but which has
been foisted upon Buddhism from some extraneous quarter, and that it is
essentially Egyptian and Gnostic.

The Gnosticism of Basilides was based on the religions which that
thinker found to his hand in Alexandria, and the task to which he set
himself was apparently to reconcile the fact of Christ with the
preconceived notions of the Alexandrian people. The religions were
mainly two, the ancient Egyptian cults, and Judaism. The mythologies of
Greece and Rome did not apparently count for much in Alexandria, the
philosophies in vogue were not those of the schools of Athens, nor were
they such as Seneca or Pliny would have delighted in. The Judaism of
Alexandria was of a far more liberal type (or shall we call it "broad"?
to be "broad" is not always to be "liberal") than that of Jerusalem, and
the "broad" school of Jewish thought which eventuated in the Cabbalah
looked to Alexandria as its nursery. Egypt lay outside of St. Paul's
province—on no other hypothesis can we explain his neglect of a city of
such importance to an Apostle to the Gentiles—and all early notices of
Alexandrian Christianity show it to have been for many years of a

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

very vague and mixed character. <span id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_78.md)
Evidently the spiritual soil of Alexandria was different from that of
Jerusalem, Ephesus, or Rome, and required a different treatment.

Basilides is spoken of by Clement of Alexandria, who had better
opportunities of judging than Irenæus, as a worthy man and an earnest
Christian, and his efforts to adapt the fact of Christ to the spiritual
prejudices of the Egyptian or Egyptianized Alexandrians were probably
quite praiseworthy. A missionary religion must adapt itself to the
circumstances and thought of the people to whom it comes. <span
id="fr_79"></span>[2](#fn_79.md)

The system of Basilides was, like the system of ancient Egypt, <span
id="fr_80"></span>[3](#fn_80.md) and like that of the Japanese Shingon,
dualistic. It represented two Worlds (βύθος and ζώη), the World of Light
and the World of Darkness. The former—like the glaring noon of an
Egyptian summer's day—was still, immovable, fixed, the world of
permanent ideas; the other, like the streets that are filled with life
at sunset, is the world of motion, of birth, of death—in short, the
world of Nature.

In the centre of the World of Light—the Diamond-World (*Kongo Kai*), as
the Shingon well calls it, to denote its fixed and permanent nature—the
Egyptians placed God, the unknown I AM, whose name the priests of
Pharaoh would not pronounce. The Gnostics called him *Pater Innatus;* in
the Japanese Shingon it is *Roshana*, the Buddha of Light, Eternal. From
that central and eternal Deity emanate, or proceed, four Beings—Eons in
Gnosticism, Buddhas in the Shingon—who surround the central God on the
Four Quarters. The Gnostics termed

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

them Logos, Phronesis, Sophia, Dynamis. <span
id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_81.md) The Shingon personifies them as Ashuku,
Hōshō, Amida, Fukūjōjū; <span id="fr_82"></span>[2](#fn_82.md) but it
treats Ashuku as representing that reason (λόγος) by which a man is
capable of faith, Hōshō as the sense (φρόνησις) which enables a man to
regulate his conduct, Amida as the Wisdom (σοφία) which enables a man to
understand and explain the divine laws, and Fukūjōjū as the practical
power which manifests itself in salvation (δύναμις).

Emanating from this central God, with his four modes of manifestation,
we have, in the Gnostic system, a number of minor Æons and other
mysterious beings, evidently borrowed from the gods of Egypt. They
numbered 365, which number written in Greek numerals spelled the word
Abraxas or Abrasax, and this name was consequently given by the
Basilidean and other Gnostics to the Deity,

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

as a whole; not to the central Pater Innatus of the World of Light, but
to the whole fulness or pleroma made up of all the Æons within that
world. It is evidently in opposition to this splitting up of the Godhead
amongst many minor and unsubstantial beings that St. Paul insists that
there is but one God, the Father, one Lord (and not four)—and that in
that one Lord dwells the whole Pleroma of the Godhead in a bodily
manner. <span id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_83.md) St. Paul scarcely seems to
be conscious of the gods of Greece and Rome; he never speaks against the
great goddess of Ephesine superstition. He is keenly alive to the
dangers which may beset the Faith which he is commissioned to preach
from Gnostic foes disguised as friends.

In Japan, the Shingon creed fills up the *Mandara* or pleroma of the
Diamond World with many Æons, whom it calls sometimes Buddhas, sometimes
Bodhisattvas, and sometimes *Myō-O*, or "mysterious kings." As a term
for the whole it employs two words, *Abarakakia* and
*Kha-la-ka-ba-a*. <span id="fr_84"></span>[2](#fn_84.md) The one is used in
the Shingon funeral rites, where it is invoked *first*, before any
invocation of personified Buddhas. The second is written in Sanskrit
characters on the wooden post which is erected over a Buddhist grave
immediately after the funeral. Both words are found in
Gnosticism—Abraxas and Caulaucau; both are identical in meaning, both
with one another and with the corresponding words in Japanese. I shall
have to mention Caulaucau again in this chapter.

We now come to the Womb-world—as the Japanese call it—the World of
moving Life, of Darkness, and of

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Death. (It is
worth while noticing that the expression "womb-world" is not confined to
the Japanese Shingon. It is also found in Epiphanius in his description
of the Basilidean conception of the World of Darkness. <span
id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_85).md) In the centre of the Womb-world we have,
in the ancient Egyptian religion, Osiris; in the Gnostic system, the
Pater Innatus; in Shingon, Vairoc’ana or Dainichi. All three systems
identify this central Deity with the Sun. <span
id="fr_86"></span>[2](#fn_86.md) From Him, in all three systems, emanates
an "ogdoad," or eight-petalled flower, known in Sanskrit as *ashṭapattra
vṛiti*, in Japanese as *hachi-yō-in*, and composed in Gnosticism of
various Æons, in Shingon of Eight Ideal Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, whose
names we need not enter into. Thus the Ogdoad *plus* the Pater Innatus
becomes an Ennead, or group of Nine, and the Shingon *hachi-yō-in* plus
Vairoc’ana becomes a similar ninefold constellation. <span
id="fr_87"></span>[3](#fn_87.md) The three systems are strikingly alike.

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

When an Egyptian died, his soul descended to the realms of Tuat, or
Hades. Here it passed through thirteen kingdoms, each with its own
guardian deity, until it finally obtained emancipation at the end. The
same thirteen kingdoms are to be found in the Gnostic book, "Pistis
Sophia," and the soul is represented as passing through them in a
similar manner. Only he who plays the part of Osiris in the Gnostic
version is Jesus. In the Shingon sect there are thirteen Buddhas <span
id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_88.md) and Bodhisattvas, who take charge of the
soul at death, the two last, Vairoc’ana and Kokūzō, remaining its
permanent guardians. The whole conception of the state of the dead in
Shingonism is Egyptian. It is certainly not Buddhist.

I might multiply examples, but I must content myself with one or two. In
Egypt, the guardian deity of the first of the mansions in Tuat bears a
name which signifies the "Crusher of the forehead of the enemies of
*Ra*." In Japan it is Fudō Sama, the fierce-looking, but essentially
kind-hearted, Being, who stands amidst the flames, and bears in his
hands a sword wherewith to slay the enemies of man's soul. The Shingon
astronomy speaks of twenty-eight *chiku*, or constellations, seven in
each quarter of the heavens; the Egyptian astronomer knew the same, and
spoke of them as the "gods of the twenty-eight finger-breadths of the
Royal cubit." The Shingon astronomer uses the Egyptian signs of the
Zodiac, <span id="fr_89"></span>[2](#fn_89.md) the same as ours,

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

and not the Turkish cycle in ordinary use in Japan. The opening chapter
of the "Saddharma pundarika Sūtra" (the *Hokekyō* of Japan) is so like
the opening chapters of the "Pistis Sophia" <span
id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90.md) that it is impossible to resist the
conclusion that the author of the latter work must have had before him
either the "Saddharma pundarika Sutra" itself or a Sūtra of a very
similar type. The latter alternative is the more probable one. The
Hokekyō is a composite work based on something that has gone before; and
it is indeed most likely that the "Ur-evangelium" in its case was a
Mahāyāna Sūtra by some early Mahāyānist writer. There are grounds for
such a conjecture. In the list of Scriptures taken to China in A.D. 147
by Anshikao the Prince of Parthia, and translated by him into Chinese
during the Han period, there is one, the "Marghabhūmi Sūtra" (Jap.
Dōshikyō <span id="fr_91"></span>[2](#fn_91).md), the last three chapters
of which are said by Nanjo to be based on the "Saddharma pundarika."
Nanjo's statement is denied by some Japanese students, still the fact
remains that there are portions of this Sūtra which

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

strongly resemble the spirit and tone of the longer Scripture, which, in
its longer and completer, form is evidently of later date.

There is also the statement made concerning the Manichean books by Cyril
of Jerusalem, <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92.md) whom, as a bishop, we
must credit with trying to speak only what he believed to be truth, and
who, as Bishop of Jerusalem, probably knew a good deal about the earlier
history of his own diocese. Cyril tells us of a certain Scythianus who
lived in Alexandria and wrote books which pretended to be the gospel,
but "had not the acts of Christ but the mere name only," to which the
"Acta Archelai" adds that he founded his sect during the lifetime of the
Apostles, and came to Jerusalem in the hope of getting them approved.
Scythianus had a disciple named Terebinthus, <span
id="fr_93"></span>[2](#fn_93.md) who apparently came to Jerusalem for the
same purpose, but was rejected by the authorities and retired to Persia,
where he assumed the name of Buddas. These books were the basis upon
which Manes founded his teachings. The resemblances between the
"Saddharma pundarika" and the "Pistis Sophia" give probability to the
story. There must have been in circulation in Alexandria, during the
latter half of the first century A.D., a Buddhist book or collection of
books which was the Ur-evangelium" of several heresies.

How far was the Gnostico-Shingon system which I have described
influenced by the speculations of the mystic school of Judaism which
eventually blossomed out into the Cabbalah? <span
id="fr_94"></span>[2](#fn_93.md) And how far was the Cabbalah influenced by
the thoughts of the Mahāyānists? It would take us too long to
investigate the problem here. A thorough investigation of this subject
would necessitate a long

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

excursion into the realms of theurgy and magic, and I must therefore
content myself with a few brief remarks. Theurgy was practised by the
Egyptians; it was a prominent feature of Gnosticism; <span
id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_94.md) it is at the present moment the main and
distinctive element of the Shingon worship, which consists very largely
of manual gestures and the repetition of certain meaningless Sanskrit
formulæ <span id="fr_96"></span>[2](#fn_95.md) The mystic formulæ are Greek
or Coptic in the one case, Sanskrit in the other; but the manual
gestures are much the same in both. It is probable that the Gnostic
system was taken by Alexandrian merchants to Southern India, a district
which had intimate trade relations with Alexandria during the whole of
the first century, <span id="fr_97"></span>[3](#fn_96.md) though it fell
off in volume after the death of Nero in A.D. 68; and it was in Southern
India, according to the Shingon story, that Nāgārjuna found the mystic
books which lie at the base of their system. <span
id="fr_98"></span>[4](#fn_97.md) This migration from Egypt to South India
would account for the Sanskritizing of a system mainly Egyptian, and
there is a certain amount of historical probability in the story as
related by the Shingon authorities; for Nanjo tell us that Nāgārjuna
(whom we may place anywhere about the middle of the second century)
received the Shingon doctrine from a teacher of the name of Vajrasattva
(Jap. Kongōsatta), and that Vajrasattva had received it, along with the
mystic Baptism, from Vairoc’ana himself through the hands of S’akyamuni,
at an assembly called the Joshōe

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
("self-nature-assembly"). <span id="fr_99"></span>[1](#fn_98.md) If we may
apply to a Buddhist assembly the ordinary rules of chronological
computation (which is perhaps a little hazardous), that
"self-nature-assembly" must have taken place about the end of the first
century A.D.

We must not forget that Antioch as well as Alexandria was a great centre
of trade with the Orient. Antioch was the centre of much Christian life.
From it went forth St. Paul and all that missionary activity which
laboured in Asia Minor, in Greece, and in Italy. From it, likewise, went
forth, Eastward, the missions to Edessa, to Nisibis, to Armenia, <span
id="fr_100"></span>[2](#fn_99.md) to Persia and beyond. From it came the
churches which were cut off in consequence of the quarrels over
Nestorius, and through the Nestorians Antioch became the grandmother of
the earliest missions—at least as far as definite records are at hand—to
China.

Antioch originated the word "Christian;" the first Christian from
Antioch whose name is recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, was a
certain Nicolas, <span id="fr_101"></span>[3](#fn_100.md) a proselyte of
that city, who was chosen to be one of the Seven Deacons. The term
"proselyte" would seem to imply that Nicolas was a Gentile by birth,
converted to Judaism, and again to Christianity. He must have been a
fickle person, for he subsequently left the Christian Church, and became
the founder of a heretical sect mentioned by the writer of the

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Apocalypse. Isis
teachings are described by Irenæus, Hippolytus, Epiphanius, and others.
They were of the general Gnostic type, and we note with interest that he
and his followers used the word *Caulaucau* as a term apparently for
God. Now, *Caulaucau* is that Buddhist term which is found along with
Abraxas in the system of Basilides and in the Japanese Shingon. It
brings the Japanese Mahāyāna very near to the holy ground of the New
Testament—too near, perhaps, for some people.

One more point remains to be noticed. It is said both of Nicolas and of
Basilides that their followers speedily lapsed into wild immoralities,
quite at variance with the austere strictness which these two
heresiarchs affected. I am not personally aware of any immoral practices
amongst the Japanese Shingonists, but the Rev. Ekai Kawaguchi, the
Buddhist priest who has travelled so long in Thibet, speaks of the
immoral doctrines of the old sect of Lamas in that country, and likewise
of an immoral sect of the Japanese Shingon which had to be suppressed on
account of its filthy practices. So I conclude that the Shingon, like
its parent Gnosticism, has, at some period in its history, presented the
same sad contrast of the pure and the impure. <span

Nichiren's favourite topics.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[61:3](chj09.htm#fr_80.md) I have taken my matter
mainly from Irenæus and Epiphanius.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[62:1](chj09.htm#fr_81.md) See "Dissertations

<span id="fn_82"></span>[62:2](chj09.htm#fr_82.md) In Sanskrit Akshobya,
Ratnasambhava, Amitābha, Amoghasiddhi. These, with the Central Roshana
or Vairoc’ana, form the Five Dhyāni Buddhas, the Gochi Nyorai of Japan.
It is to be noted that Fukūjōjū is identified with S’akyamuni. Millioué
("Cat. Mus. Guimet," 1883, p. 204) identifies Amida with the Egyptian
Amenti. In the funeral ritual of the Shingon he appears as *Amṛita*,
"The Immortal." I believe that it must have been this personage whom the
Gnostics identified with Christ. There was evidently, from the case of
Fukūjōjū, a disposition to identify the Dhyāni Buddhas with actual
teachers and saints, and it is quite evident that the Alexandrian
Gnostics did not look upon Christ as the only Saviour.

It is interesting to compare St. Paul's treatment of a somewhat similar
problem in the Epistle to the Ephesians, which, like Colossians, is
treating of some Gnostic or quasi-Gnostic difficulties. In it (Ephes.
iv.) we have Christ the centre of all ministerial authority; and,
issuing from Him, a fourfold ministry: Apostles, centres of authority,
who appeal to the will; Prophets, whose sphere lies in the imagination;
Evangelists, who appeal to men as reasonable beings; Pastors and
Teachers, who guide men through the emotions and affections. Men do not
always express themselves alike; in this case, however, the underlying
thought is the same. God has many ways of saving lost mankind.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[63:1](chj09.htm#fr_83.md) *E.g.* Col. i. 19.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[63:2](chj09.htm#fr_84.md) Japanese has no *l*
sound. Hence I write here *mandara*, not *mandala*. This word has become
naturalized. But *Kha-la-ka-ba-a* is always written in Sanskrit letters,
hence I write it with an *l*.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[64:1](chj09.htm#fr_85.md) I have consulted, for
the purposes of this comparison, (i.) the chapter on Shingon in Dr.
Nanjo's "Short History of the Twelve Japanese Buddhist Sects;" (ii.) Dr.
Wallis Budge, the "Gods of Egypt;" and (iii.) the accounts of the
Gnostic sects given by Hippolytus, Irenæus, and Epiphanius. The Greek
word used is μήτρα. See Bousset on Gnosticism.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[64:2](chj09.htm#fr_86.md) This gives us the point
of contact with the Japanese Shinto. It was the policy of the Shingon
and other early sects to identify the Japanese Sun-goddess Amaterasu
with Vairoc’ana. Amaterasu is the fabled divine ancestress of the
Imperial House, and the sixteen-petal chrysanthemum, which is the
Imperial crest, is said to be a Buddhist emblem, an expansion of the
*Hachi-yō-in*, adopted circa A.D. 1120 at the suggestion of a courtly
Buddhist monk by the Emperor Toba, who was an ardent Buddhist. Strangely
enough, Dr. N. G. Munro, of Yokohama, has found the sixteen-petal
chrysanthemum on an Egyptian tomb. It is also found in "Pistis Sophia."

<span id="fn_87"></span>[64:3](chj09.htm#fr_87) Dr. Nanjo (p. 91.md) speaks
of the "Mandala of nine Assemblies of the Vajradhatu, which corresponds
to the *nine* Beings of the *Hachi-yō-in*." It is also noteworthy that
there are nine stages in our knowledge of Amida, who is accordingly
sometimes represented by nine figures, each a little different from the
rest. There are also nine forms of Osiris.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[65:1](chj09.htm#fr_88.md) The thirteen Buddhas of
the Shingon are Fudō (one week after death), S’akyamuni (2nd week),
Manjus’ri (3rd week), Samantabhadra (4th week), Kshitigarbha (5th week),
Maitreya (6th week), Bhaishajyaguru (7th week); Avalokites’vara (100
days), Mahāsthāmaprāpta (1 year), Amitābha (3 years), Akshobya (7
years), Vairoc’ana and Kokūzō, for ever. To these correspond a series of
thirteen planets and heavenly deities. See "Catalogue of Musée Guimet,"
p. 191 (1883).

<span id="fn_89"></span>[65:2](chj09.htm#fr_89.md) The Shingon signs of
the, Zodiac are: (1) Hōbyōgū, *Aquarius*; (2) Suigyōgū, *Pisces;* (3)
Byakuyōgū, *Aries;* (4) Go mitsugū, *Taurus;* (5) Nannyōgū, *Virgo*
(though this is bisexual); (6) Būgegū, *Cancer;* (7) Sonyōgū, <span
id="page_67">p. 67</span> *Gemellæ* (not Gemini); (8) Shishigū, *Leo;*
(9) Hyōryōgū, *Libra;* (10) Kattchengū, *Scorpio;* (11) Kūgū,
*Sagittarius;* (12) Makatsugū, *Capricornus*.

The ordinary signs are the Rat, Bull, Tiger, Hare, Dragon, Snake, Horse,
Ram, Monkey, Cock, Dog, Boar. This is the Turkish cycle. In some of the
trades, such as the building trade, which abounds in ancient customs, I
have found an occasional use of the Buddhist cycle.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[66:1](chj09.htm#fr_90.md) The resemblances between
these two books are extremely striking. I have called attention to the
subject in a lecture delivered before the Asiatic Society of Japan. The
resemblances lie principally in the structure and conception of the two
dialogues, in certain mannerisms' of speech and action, and in the light
that emanates from the Teacher in either case. There is also a śtrong
similarity between the two books in respect to the use of *gāthās* and
songs.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[66:2](chj09.htm#fr_91.md) In Nanjo's "Catalogue of
the Tripitaka," No. 1326. Another Han book, the earliest edition of the
*Sukhāvati Vyūha*, differs largely from the versions made in the fourth
and fifth centuries which are now current in Japan.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[67:2](chj09.htm#fr_94.md) See, below, the chapter
on Manichæism, p. 147.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[68:1](chj09.htm#fr_95.md) See, *e.g.*, "Pistis
Sophia," cap. 64.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[68:2](chj09.htm#fr_96.md) I have worked out many
of these in an article on the "Care of the Dead," written for Hasting's"
