# THE CREED OF HALF JAPAN

### CHAPTER I

<span class="smallcaps">Mahāyāna</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Mahāyāna is a form of Buddhism. The
word means "the Large Vehicle" or "Conveyance," and is used to
distinguish the later and amplified Buddhism from the Hīnayāna or Small
Vehicle, which contains the doctrines of that form of Buddhism which is
purely Indian. The original language of the Hīnayāna Scriptures is Pali,
the language of Magadha in S’akyamuni's lifetime; that of the Mahāyāna
books is Sanskrit, the literary tongue of the Brahmans, adopted by
Greeks, Parthians, and Scythians as a means of theological expression,
when they came in turns to be masters of North-West India and the
fertile valleys watered by the Indus and its tributaries, in the Punjaub
and in Afghanistan, the language of many a controversy about philosophy
human and divine, as Brahman and Buddhist strove in the early centuries
of our era for the spiritual supremacy of India.

It would be a mistake to suppose that the Greater Vehicle differs from
the Lesser only because it contains in it more of subtle dialectic and
daring speculation. The case is not so: the Pali books are every whit as
deep and every whit as full of speculation as their Sanskrit

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

rivals. The Hīnayāna is the Lesser Vehicle only because it is more
limited in its area. It draws its inspiration from India and from India
only, and had it been possible to confine Buddhism within the limits of
the Magadhan kingdom, or even within the limits of As’oka's actual
dominions, we may safely infer that it would have continued to be
Hīnayāna only, as has been the case in Ceylon, where it has not been
obliged to rub shoulders with deeply modifying or disturbing influences.
But when once Buddhism stepped outside the limits of India pure and
simple, to seek converts amongst Greeks and Parthians, Bactrians, Medes,
Turks, Scythians, Chinese, and all the chaos of nations that has made
the history of Central Asia so extremely perplexing to the student,
immediately its horizon was enlarged by the inclusion of many outside
elements of philosophic thought. It was no longer the comfortable family
coach in which India might ride to salvation: it was the roomy omnibus
intended to accommodate men of all races and nations and to convey them
safely to the Perfection of Enlightened Truth. It is true that it never
forgot the rock from whence it had been hewn; that it always spoke of
itself as a religion intended primarily for the world of India. With a
touching shamefacedness, it tried to gloss over the inconsistency of its
own missionary zeal. The boundaries of India were supposed to enlarge
themselves as the missionaries of Buddhism advanced towards the East.
The Hindu Kush and the Himalayas ceased to be the boundaries of the
sacred land of Jambudvīpa. In process of time Jambudvīpa included
Central Asia, China, and even Japan. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

The Mahāyāna was probably a matter of slow and, at first, unobserved
growth. Among the numerous sects which divided the Hīnayāna at the
commencement of the Christian era, some were probably more
comprehensive, more advanced, than others, and there must have been some
which had almost reached to the expansive fulness of the Mahāyāna
itself. Very little indeed is known of the history of Buddhism between
the death of As’oka and the dawn of the Christian era—during the period,
that is, when the Mahāyāna was in the state of gestation. What we do
know is that about the end of the first century of the Christian era,
between five and six hundred years after the death of Buddha, the
Mahāyāna comes into existence in Kashmir and North-West India and the
valley of the Indus; that it enjoys the patronage of the Scythian
conquerors of those districts, whose conversion to Buddhism may have
been due, in the first place, to a politic desire to stand well with
their newly acquired Buddhist subjects; that it was adorned by some
great names of saints and doctors; and that it spread from the land of
its birth to the most distant regions of Northern and Eastern Asia.

It is not necessary in this work to write a long and elaborate life of
S’akyamuni. That subject has been exhaustively treated of by many great
scholars, and Japan has very little of new material to contribute
towards it. I shall take up the main thread of my story from the time
when the Mahāyāna makes its first distinct appearance on the stage of
Eastern religious life, that is, during the first century of the
Christian era. In doing so, I shall have to touch on the first
beginnings of Christianity also, the contemporary faith which, in those
early days, converted the West, while failing, comparatively, to win the
East for Christ, just as the Mahāyāna seemed to be hindered from

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

impressing itself on the West, while it has had a free course and a
lasting success in the lands of the Far East. In the course of these
pages certain considerations will be advanced (with how much of
convincing power it must rest with the reader to decide) to show that
the two faiths came into actual contact with one another in many points
during the first and second centuries of our era, and that each
contributed something to the success and failure of the other. It is a
most difficult subject to handle, and before setting myself to work at
it, I can but pray—a good old-fashioned custom for which I am almost
ashamed to feel myself obliged to offer an apology—that nothing I write
may offend against that sacred cause of Truth, which should be the only
aim of the scientific and Christian scholar.

But, before plunging into my subject proper, it seems but right that I
should devote a few short chapters to the consideration of the person of
the Founder, and of the extent of As’oka's influence, as shown by the
rock inscriptions which that monarch has left behind him. These chapters
will enable the reader more accurately to estimate the extent of the
acquaintance which we may suppose Europe and India to have had of one
another at the time when Christianity and the Mahāyāna sprang
simultaneously into life.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[2:1](chj03.htm#fr_0.md) Nichiren, for instance,
constantly speaks of *ichi em bu dai* (which is his way of writing
Jambudvīpa) as = India, China, and Japan. It was a protest, by way of
adaptation, against the idea that a Buddha could not be born outside of
India.
