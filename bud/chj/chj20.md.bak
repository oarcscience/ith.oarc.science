### CHAPTER XVIII

<span class="smallcaps">The Crown Prince Shōtoku Taishi</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Emperor Kimmei, who had received from
Korea the gifts of Buddhist images and sacred vessels which had caused
so much disturbance among his subjects, died in A.D. 570. His reign had
not been a very happy or glorious one. In addition to the domestic
confusions arising from the introduction of the new religion, there had
been disappointments in the foreign policy of the country. His ally,
King Seimei of Kudara, had been defeated by the troops of Shiragi and
taken prisoner (about 557), a Japanese army in Korea had been defeated
by the Shiragi armies in 562, and the province of Mimāna had been
entirely lost to Japan. When Kimmei lay a-dying in 570, he charged his
successor, Bidatsu, not to rest until Mimāna had been recovered.

It was not Bidatsu's good fortune to recover the lost province, and when
he died, in A.D. 585, he laid on his successor, Yōmei, the same solemn
injunction that his predecessor had laid upon him. But the year
following his accession, the wife of his brother Yōmei bore a son who
was destined to restore the fallen prestige of the country. The child
thus born was at the first called Umayado, "the Stable Prince," a name
which has been explained by the story (surely a fiction) that his
mother, while going the rounds of her house and grounds, was suddenly
seized by labour pains, and gave birth to her son in the stable.

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He had another
name, Toyoto-mimi, which may convey some reference to his personal
appearance; but at any rate personal defects had no effect on his
intellectual powers, and he was early distinguished both for wisdom and
for virtue.

His early youth was a troublous one. Bidatsu continued to receive
presents (and appeals for help) from the King of Kudara, hard pressed by
Shiragi and scarcely able to hold his own. Without becoming a convert,
the Emperor did all in his power to help the new religion, and, to give
but one instance, instituted the practice of releasing animals on the
eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, twenty-third, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth
of every month—an institution not unlike the primitive *uposatha*, or
the Christian and Jewish sabbath. No civic disturbances marked his
reign; but once, when a pestilence broke out shortly after the erection
of a pagoda, built to contain a Buddhist relic that had, it was claimed,
been found in some rice, there must have been many doubtful heads shaken
over the untoward event. But the Buddhists were not to be moved. They
met the pestilence with the weapon of prayer, and when the Emperor
himself miraculously recovered from an attack of the plague, they felt
that they had triumphed.

In 586, Prince Umayado's father, Yōmei, came to the throne, and the
Prince became, in expectation at least, Heir-Apparent. Yōmei went
further than any of his predecessors, for he was the first Imperial
convert to Buddhism, and the first emperor to be baptized with the
Buddhist ceremony of Kwanjo. His conversion possibly cost him his life,
for he died in the following year, and his death was the occasion for
the outbreak of a civil war, which ended with the Battle of Shigisen, in
which the Prince Shōtoku and his staunch friend, Soga

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

no Umako, were victorious. It would seem that the Prince's Buddhism was
of too pronounced a type for him to be a suitable occupant of the
throne, which went to his uncle Sujun, a younger brother of Bidatsu and
Yōmei. Sujun must have been the candidate favoured by the conservative
Kami worshippers, or at least acceptable to them. He made preparations
for an expedition against Shiragi, but he was apparently unable to
preserve the loyalty of the advanced party of the Buddhists, for he was
murdered in 592 by the ally of the Prince, Soga no Umako.

The Prince was again passed over—voluntarily, it would seem. Sujun's
successor was his elder half-sister, Suiko, the widow of Bidatsu—for
marriages between half-brothers and half-sisters were always allowed in
ancient Japan. Suiko reigned from 593 to 628; for all but the last seven
years, her nephew, now known as Shōtoku Taishi, acted as her deputy and
vice-gerent, so that what was nominally the reign of the Empress Suiko
was in reality the reign of the Crown Prince Shōtoku.

Shōtoku's life-work falls under three heads. We must judge him by his
foreign policy, his domestic administration, and his religious
achievements.

His foreign policy was eminently successful. His uncles had dreamed of
conquering Shiragi, and an expedition was actually on the point of
starting when the Emperor Sujun was murdered. Shōtoku tried a more
conciliatory line of policy, and one more in accordance with the
religious professions of a Buddhist. He sent embassies to Shiragi, in
597, and again in 600, with the result that tribute was sent to Japan,
not only from Shiragi, but from Mimāna as well, showing thereby that,
thanks to the Regent's wise policy, Shiragi had recognized the
independence of the state of Mimāna protected by the

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

cont}Japanese. Shōtoku even went further in asserting the dignity of his
country. He dared to claim for Japan an equal Imperial dignity with
China, which Wen-ti of the Sui Dynasty had just united once more under
one sceptre. Wen-ti had stretched his dominions from the frontiers of
Koma in the east, to those of the Turki kingdoms in the west, and his
successor, Yangti, who ruled from 606 to 618, had extended his power
still further. Shōtoku's Korean policy brought him into collision with
Yangti, who also had designs on the peninsula, and in 609 a letter came
from the Chinese sovereign, which the Japanese Court received. Shōtoku
answered it, but in a tone of equality, "The Eastern Emperor begs
respectfully to speak to the Emperor of the West." The Chinese Court did
not altogether appreciate the tone of the letter; but in 610 Koma sent
presents to the Court of Japan, and Shiragi in 616. Bluff, or rather the
proper assertion of dignity, is at times a very paying line of policy
for a statesman to adopt.

Shōtoku's home administration is chiefly connected with an attempt made
in 603 to arrange the official ranks of persons in Government service
according to the model of the Chinese Court, <span
id="fr_228"></span>[1](#fn_226.md) and the Constitution of the Seventeen
Articles issued in the following year. The newly graded official ranks
were named after the Confucianist virtues, as though to remind the
holders of the paramount importance of virtue above all things else; in
the Constitution we have traces of Confucianist influence, together with
an outspoken advocacy of Buddhism, as being, in the writer's mind at
least, the sole religion for a wise man to follow.

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

The seventeen Articles of the Constitution throw a very bright light on
the conditions of the country which Shōtoku sought to amend. It was a
period of disunion and discord, dating probably from days prior to the
introduction of Buddhism, but also probably accentuated by the same. The
results of this discord were visible in the loss of Mimāna and of almost
all prestige in Korea, and in the backwardness of Japanese culture.
Shōtoku appeals to the country on behalf of concord, in his first
Article: in the second, he points his countrymen to what he feels to be
the best and truest way of arriving at the same—the whole-hearted
acceptance of Buddhism. We cannot but admire the boldness of his words,
in view of the still constant opposition to foreign doctrines. Neither
can we forget that, just about this time, an Emperor of China was coming
to the conclusion that, whenever a ruler showed himself too partial
towards the doctrines of Buddhism, he always brought ruin on his
dynasty. <span id="fr_229"></span>[1](#fn_227.md) In Shōtoku's eyes,
Buddhism wore a very different aspect.

In Article III., Shōtoku dwells on the dignity of the Emperor, who
stands above his people, covering them with his protection, just as
Heaven stands over and protects the earth beneath it. The Article was
probably directed against the nobles, whose respect for the sovereign in
those days of civil strife and confusion was not always as great as it
should have been. The Article must, moreover, be read in reference to
the murder of the Emperor Sujun by Shōtoku's ally, Soga no Umako. Had
Shōtoku felt himself in any way to be blamed for his continued
friendship for the man who had committed that deed, he would scarcely
have ventured to speak as he did of the respect due to the
Emperor. <span id="fr_230"></span>[2](#fn_228.md) It would seem as though

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sujun had been a
usurper, possibly with the aid of the opponents of Buddhism; that Soga
no Umako, as the supporter of Shōtoku's claims, had opened the way for
the Prince to succeed, and that the Prince, declining to come to the
throne in this way, had secured the nomination of his aunt. He was
conscious of his own rights as the son of Yōmei, yet he stood back in
order that he might be in a position to speak with greater emphasis of
the duty that the subject owes to his sovereign. It is evident from the
Article that Shōtoku did not share the subsequently formulated and now
officially accepted doctrine as to the origin of the Imperial House.

The following Articles deal with the duties of ministers and
functionaries. If subjects have certain duties towards their rulers,
rulers and magistrates have certain responsibilities towards those
beneath them, which must be discharged with decorum and the observance
of due proportion. Such observance cannot fail to have a good influence
on the country at large (Art. iv.). But if, on the other hand (Art. v.),
the magistracy allows itself to be bribed with gifts, if the judge is
remiss in the administration of justice, if he gives his decisions to
suit his own interests, or without clearness, the poor will no longer
know whom to look to for support, and the country will lose its
prosperity. Lying and flattery (Art. vi.) have been evils in every
country and age; Shōtoku's age was certainly not free from them. It was
exposed to another peril, that of hereditary office (Arts. vii. and
viii.). Men were promoted to dignities and high charges, not for any
special capacities that they had shown in inferior positions, but
because these offices were considered to be the perquisites of certain
families. And the hereditary office had but too often been treated as a

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

sinecure. The result of all this (Art. ix.) was the loss of public
confidence.

In Arts. x.–xiv., the evils arising from the want of a feeling of
responsibility, on the part of these hereditary holders of offices
treated almost as sinecures, are laid out more in detail. The magistrate
would allow himself to lose his temper on the bench, and bully the
accused or the witnesses. He should remember that it was always possible
that he himself might not always be the perfection of wisdom; that it
was also possible that the prisoner in the dock, and the witness under
cross-examination, were reasonable men (Art. x.). He should listen,
therefore, to the opinions of others, should give his decisions with
sobriety and fear, and be very careful to administer praise and blame in
strict accordance with the results of a severe and impartial
investigation (Art. xi.). He should be careful to levy no arbitrary
taxes, on his own authority, in the district over which he was called to
rule, so as not to provoke the people to resistance (Art. vii.). He
should know the working of every detail of his own office, and the
regularity or slackness of the members of his staff. If something had
gone wrong, because a subordinate was absent from his post, the chief of
the bureau must not excuse himself by saying that he did not know the
man was absent. It was his duty to know it, and to provide for the
public service being properly attended to (Art. xiii.). Mutual
jealousies have often brought ruin upon a State. Saints and sages appear
but rarely in the world; jealousy and envy are the main obstacles which
hinder their more frequent development. And what would become of the
government of a country without sages or saints? (Art. xv.). A sage or a
saint, he continues, showing the identity of both Confucianist and
Buddhist teachings in this respect, is one who sacrifices his own

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

will, and devotes himself to the service of others. This principle
produces self-sacrifice in the governors, obedience in the people, and
makes for peace and harmony (Art. xv.). It shows itself in the way in
which orders are given.

For instance, Government has the right to demand a certain amount of
forced labour from the people. But times and seasons must be observed.
If the governor makes the people work for the State during the summer
months, the farmer will suffer, and distress will ensue. If the governor
exercises patience and self-control, and waits till winter comes there
will be no friction (Art. xvi.). "Never act," he concludes, "on your own
private initiative or authority; and never take any step of importance
without consultation. In a doubtful case, consult the more" (Art.
xvii.). <span id="fr_231"></span>[1](#fn_229.md)

Such were the principal defects which Shōtoku found in the
administration of the country after he had had his hand at the helm of
State for several years. For these evils he had two great remedies. The
one was the reform of the judiciary and magistracy according to
Chinese <span id="fr_232"></span>[2](#fn_230.md)

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

models; the other was the inculcation and propagation of Buddhism, as
the best religion he knew, and as eminently fitted, in his judgment, to
supply to his countrymen that firm ethical basis which the Shintoism of
the time lacked, plus the religious enthusiasm which comes from a
definite theological system. We will now pass on to the consideration of
Shōtoku's religion.

Shōtoku has been much blamed by modern Shintoist writers as wanting in
patriotism, because he laid no stress on the national gods of the land,
and because, in the second article of his Constitution, he emphasized
Buddhism as the sole religion worthy to be adopted by his subjects. It
is true that the saying once currently attributed to him, that the
religion of Japan was like a tripod standing on three legs, Buddhism,
Confucianism, and the Shinto, cannot be sustained, because, as Dazai
truly observes, Shinto did not exist, *i.e.* was not elevated into a
system, until long after the Crown Prince's time. <span
id="fr_233"></span>[1](#fn_231.md) But it is also true that there is no
sign of his having forced his beliefs on the consciences of his people
against their wills. He confined himself to preaching the faith which he
had adopted with all his heart and soul; for other forms of faith and
religion, he had no thoughts left.

He had no reason to love the Kami-worshippers. The adherents of that
system were not only conservatives in religion, but probably
obstructionists in the path of popular progress, and were opposed not
only to Buddhism, but to Confucianism as well. His whole early life had
been embittered by the antagonism of a Conservative party, which was not
even loyal to the throne; it can hardly cause wonder if, on his
accession to power, he did

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

not go out of his way to recommend a system which had always stood in
the way of the reforms and the progress he was so anxious to inaugurate.
Besides, the Shinto of his day needed no commendation from him. It was
already well established in the hearts of the people. It had not yet
been systematized—that came later, as a result of the opposition to
Buddhism—neither had the amalgamation between the two religions yet been
carried out. But we can well imagine that Shōtoku saw no reason why it
should not be quietly absorbed by the all-embracing Buddhism which he
preached. There was no need for mentioning the subject. He would preach
Buddha, and trust to coming events for the result.

Shōtoku, like As’oka, whom he very much resembled in character, was a
preacher. The fact facilitates the task of the historian, for we
fortunately know the texts from which he preached to the ladies and
gentlemen of his aunt's court. In the year 606, two years after the
promulgation of his Constitution, he lectured in his palace at Naniwa on
three books, the "Saddharmapundarika Sūtra," the
"Vimāla-Kīrtti-nirdesa-sūtra," and the
"S’rimāladenī-simhananda-sūtra." <span id="fr_234"></span>[1](#fn_232.md)
In the same year he decreed the observance of S’akyamuni's birthday. We
may sum up the three Sūtras by saying that the first furnished Shōtoku
with a manual of theology; the second, with texts on the duties of the
devout layman; the third, with homilies on the duties of faithful women.
On these three Sūtras he preached and also composed commentaries.

The Hokekyō is an extremely well-known Sūtra. It is one of a
comparatively late date, for, when the five subdivisions of the Mahāyāna
Sūtras were made, it was not in existence, and Dr. Nanjo gives it to us
under a

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

separate heading as one of the Sūtras of the Mahāyāna not included under
any of the previous five classes. It is post-Christian in its structure,
and betrays acquaintance with the New Testament scriptures, an
acquaintance which it may have derived through Manichæism. <span
id="fr_235"></span>[1](#fn_233.md) It represents S’akyamuni, but not as he
was in the guise of his historical life, preaching a simple life to
simple persons, and bringing to the searcher after Truth in India the
gospel of a relief from the fetters of caste and the possibility of
attaining to a Nirvana of rest and freedom, without penances or
austerities, by a simple placing of trust in Himself and a following
along the noble Eightfold Path of Right Actions, Right Views, Right
Aspirations. It represents Him as the Eternal Buddha, without beginning
and without end, manifested in India as Gotama, but manifested often
both before and since. It represents him spiritually present with his
people, giving them His spiritual Body for their worship, with four
great Ministers before Him, and surrounded with a glorious company which
no man can number, of perfected saints who rise to greet Him out of the
clefts of the earth. And, if we may judge from the fact that all the
images which came to Japan in those early days were images of Amida,
with or without his great son and representative Kwannon
(Avalokites’vara) and his other minister Seishi (Mah’āsthāmaprāpta), we
shall infer that Shōtoku identified the glorified S’akyamuni of the
Hokekyo, the counterpart, to use no stronger expression, of our Christ,
with the Great Buddha, Amitābha, as do the Shinshuists to-day. <span
id="fr_236"></span>[2](#fn_234.md)

The other two Sūtras are not so well known, neither

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

has the Commentary by Shōtoku ever been made accessible to Western
scholars. All I know of the "Shomangyō," the Sūtra treating of the
duties of women, is that it is classed by Nanjo among the Avatamsaka
Scriptures which formed the Canon used by the Yogāchārya sect, the
Japanese Hossō. It is therefore a writing of a comparatively late
date.' <span id="fr_237"></span>[1](#fn_235.md) Of the "Yuimakyo," which
deals with the duties of the Buddhist layman, there is fortunately an
English translation, published in 1897 in the columns of a now defunct
periodical, the *Hansei Zasshi*. It is too lengthy to be reproduced
here, but it is very practical, and contains a very full summary of the
religious life as viewed by the Mahāyānist. A man who should fashion his
life according to its precepts would come very near to being a holy man.
He might, however, be a prig.

Shōtoku was also a man who believed in the power and efficacy of prayer.
When his friend the Ōmi, Soga no Umako, lay ill, he instituted formal
intercessions for his recovery, and a thousand persons took temporary
vows to lead a monastic life until the sick man should recover.
Shōtoku's limitations were due to his exalted position. Had he been born
a prince of a long- dethroned house, like Christ, with no thoughts
before him of temporal power, or had he been able to make the
renunciation of earthly position, which is such a touching and prominent
feature in the life of S’akyamuni, he would have accomplished even more
than he did. It was his misfortune that, like As’oka, he had to combine
the offices of priest and prince in his own person. When a ruling prince
takes to preaching, there is always a danger lest the

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

doctrine, becoming superficially popular, should become perverted. It
was so in As’oka's case; it was so in Shōtoku's. Three years after his
death stringent measures had to be taken to enforce discipline amongst
an immoral clergy, and the Nara age, to which we are now coming, was a
very corrupt and superstitious one. There is no healthy religion of any
kind that does not involve the bearing of a cross of some sort or other.

It is a true instinct that has led the Shinshu or "True Sect" believers
in Japan to place Shōtoku on a pedestal of honour as the firstfruits of
Amidaism in Japan. For undoubtedly he was inspired by the idea of that
great Being, the counterpart of our Western Christ, who humbled himself
that he might save man, who was exalted when he had accomplished that
salvation, and from whom so much of comfort and strength has flowed out
to suffering humanity in Japan and the Far East. <span
id="fr_238"></span>[1](#fn_236.md) A further study of Comparative
Chronology, one of the most important branches of the study of religion,
will show us that Shōtoku was the contemporary of that religious
movement which took place in the capital of the Chinese Tangs, when the
victories of Mahometanism brought Christian and Zoroastrian exiles to
the court of Singanfu, to rub shoulders together in the sympathy that
came to them from the participation in a common misfortune.
