### CHAPTER XXVI

<span class="smallcaps">The Mongols</span>

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> the year 1282, Nichiren, reviewing his
own life, said that there were three things for which he considered
himself deserving of commendation. <span id="fr_460"></span>[1](#fn_458.md)
He had published his treatise of "Risshō Ankoku," and presented a copy
to the Regent, at great personal risk to himself, thereby calling the
Regent's attention to the evils of the State, and the only apparent
remedy for them. He had next, some years later, dared to tell the same
exalted personage that the only safety for the State lay in the adoption
of the doctrines which he himself so earnestly advocated. This boldness
had almost cost him his life. And, lastly, not content with general
warnings about the Mongols, he had foretold the exact time when the
much-dreaded invasion was going to take place, and events had fully
justified his prophecy.

We have spoken of Nichiren's famous writing; we have also treated of the
doctrines which he preached in season and out. It remains for us to
speak of the Mongols and their attempted invasion of Japan.

Central and North-Eastern Asia was for centuries the cradle of fierce
and barbarous races which started out on a career of conquest, and
acquired permanent homes for themselves in the fertile and more favoured
districts of Europe. Scythians and Goths, Alans and Huns,

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bulgarians and
Cumani, Yuëtchi and Uighurs, were merely "reshuffles of the same
cards," <span id="fr_461"></span>[1](#fn_459.md) different strata, as it
were, of the same peoples, going forth from their homes in Central Asia
to worry the civilized nations of two continents.

In the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries, it was the
Mongolian power that made itself feared throughout the world. <span
id="fr_462"></span>[2](#fn_460.md) The Mongols and the Tartars were, as it
were, the aristocracy and plebs of a large semi-barbarous tribe of nomad
herdsmen, hunters, and warriors, whose home lay to the north of China
proper, around the Gobi Desert, by the banks of the Amur river, and
among the mountains south of Lake Baikal. Here was born in the year
1162, in the tent of the tribal chief, a child to whom was given the
name of Temujin, a name afterwards exchanged for that of Gengis-Khan, or
the Perfect Warrior. <span id="fr_463"></span>[3](#fn_461.md) Gengis Khan
in due time succeeded to the chieftaincy of the Mongol and Tartar tribes
(1206), and then commenced a series of victories, campaigns, and
conquests, which fairly throws the exploits of Alexander and Napoleon
into the shade, the Mongol conqueror having this advantage over his two
European rivals, that he was able to transmit his power and military
genius to descendants as remarkable

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

and as talented as himself. The first conquests of the Mongols were in
Northern China; their next exploit was the overthrow of the Chowaresmian
Kingdom, which reached from India to the Caspian Sea, with its capital
at Bokhara. From the Caspian to Russia was but a step; in 1237 (only
thirty years after Gengis Khan's election) his grandson Batu, at the
head of a Mongol army; had subdued Russia, burnt Moscow and Khiew, and
compelled the Russian princes to do him homage and pay tribute to the
Great Khan, his uncle Octal, the son of Genghis, who ruled at Karakorum,
somewhere halfway in a straight line between Pekin and Lake Baikal.
Entering Poland and Silesia, they were met by a German army at Wahlstatt
in 1241, and, though victors in the battle, pushed their advances no
further in this direction; but, devoting themselves to the strengthening
of their dominions in South Russia, pushed their conquests into Hungary,
drove the king of that country to take refuge on an island off the coast
of Dalmatia, and advanced to within two days’ march of Vienna. Their
line of march was everywhere marked by terrible traces of vindictive
cruelty. They spared neither age nor sex, neither town nor country,
neither palace nor church. They had no respect for, and less fear of,
the chivalry of Europe. They knew that Christendom was a conglomeration
of States hostile to each other; they knew, also, that the best elements
in Christendom were frittering away their strength in vain attempts to
recover the Holy Sepulchre, and so long as it pleased Western Europe to
keep up the Crusades, they did not trouble themselves much about
attacking the Saracens. Nevertheless, in 1258, their Asiatic armies
overthrew the Khalifate of Bagdad and destroyed that city, and when,
between 1274 and 1279, Kublaï Khan, the grandson and fourth successor of
Gengis Khan, added the whole of China

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

to the dominions of the Mongols, their Empire could fairly claim to be
the largest that the world had ever seen. It embraced the whole of Asia
(except Hindustan, which was afterwards conquered, Burma, Siam, Arabia,
and Japan), the whole of European Russia, and the eastern half of
Hungary.

When Kublaï Khan was in the midst of his conquests in China, having
already overthrown the dynasty of the Kin, and being then meditating the
subjugation of the rival dynasty of the Sung, he remembered the Empire
of Japan, as having been at one time in the habit of sending presents to
the Tang Emperors, which those rulers accepted as tribute. At once, in
1268, he sent an arrogant letter to the Regent, demanding the submission
of Japan to the rule of the Mongol Khans, and the transmission of
tribute in recognition of that suzerainty. We know what was the tenour
of that letter. The Mongols had for several years been sending the most
insulting and arrogant epistles to the Russian princes, the Kings of
Hungary and France, the Emperor of Germany, and even the Pope, and the
letter to the Regent of Japan was couched in no less arrogant language
than the other missives. But Hōjō Tokimune was a match for the Tartar
Khan (were they not all chips of the same block? and may not Japanese
blood have been mixed with that of the Mongol chiefs?), and well
understood the art of meeting arrogance with arrogance. The first letter
was left without an answer. A second letter, sent with an embassy in
1271, was returned unopened. In 1274 Kublaï sent a fleet of 150 ships,
which ravaged Tsushima and Ikishima, and effected a landing at Imatsu in
Chikuzen, an expedition which might have been very serious had not the
Mongol commander been killed in battle and a large part of the fleet
destroyed by a typhoon. Tokimune must have known by this time that he
was

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

running tremendous risks in opposing a Power whose rulers openly boasted
that they were lords over the whole earth; yet he never swerved from the
line he had taken up of meeting arrogance with pride. In 1276, Kublaï
sent an ambassador to Kamakura. Tokimune caused him to be led out to
Tatsu no Kuchi (the same spot that had witnessed the attempted execution
of Nichiren), and there beheaded him. Two others, who came on the same
errand, were beheaded at Hakata in Kyūshū, as soon as ever they landed
on Japanese soil. Further hostilities were now unavoidable. In 1279,
Tokimune ordered the Daimyōs of Kyūshū and the West to prepare to resist
a hostile invasion. In 1281, an Armada, carrying 100,000 Mongols and
10,000 Koreans, appeared off Dazaifu in Kyūshū, having ravaged the
island of Iki on the way. The invaders landed at Goryū-san in Hizen,
where they met with a strenuous resistance. At the end of a week's
fighting, neither army could claim to have gained much advantage. Then
came one of those terrible storms that from time to time visit the
shores of Japan; the invaders were obliged to look to the safety of
their ships; they were literally "between the Devil and the deep sea,"
and, being in that awkward predicament, were practically annihilated. Of
all the mediæval nations of Asia and Europe that were obliged to face
those terrible conquerors in the heyday of their power, Japan was the
only one that scored a complete victory. It was also probably the only
one that absolutely refused to be cowed by Tartar bluster.

But we must not forget that our present concern with the Mongol invasion
of Japan is its bearing on the religious history of that country.

We mentioned in a previous chapter that Nichiren expounded a system of
millenarianism very similar to that which the Franciscan Abbot Joachim
advocated in his

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Commentaries on
the Book of Revelation, between 1170 and 1200, A.D. Abbot Joachim's work
enjoyed a very great reputation during those last years of the twelfth
century. Is it possible that these two sets of Apocalyptic speculations
can in any sense have had a common source or origin?

First, I would mention the fact that Abbot Joachim travelled in the East
as a young man, before commencing his work on the Apocalypse. It is
quite possible that he may have there gathered the ideas which he
afterwards put into definite literary form in his books.

Secondly, it is a certain fact that the religious world of Europe took a
great deal of interest in the Conversion to Christianity of the Great
Khan of Tartary, and that several embassies were sent from Europe for
that purpose. The matter was brought before the Council of Lyons, in
1245, by Pope Innocent IV., and a resolution arrived at that the Pope
should send missionaries to the Mongol Emperor, urging him to abstain
from further bloodshed and to turn to the true faith. In consequence of
this resolution, Innocent IV. sent two embassies, which left Rome the
following year. The first, which consisted of four Dominican monks, was
sent to Persia, to plead with the Mongolian generals in that
country. <span id="fr_464"></span>[1](#fn_462.md) The second was taken from
the Order of St. Francis, and consisted of Brother Benedict of Poland,
Brother Lawrence of Portugal, and John de Plan Carpin, an Italian. This
embassy, of which John de Plan Carpin has left a very minute
account, <span id="fr_465"></span>[2](#fn_463.md) made its way right across
Central Asia and Siberia to Karakorum, somewhere to the south of Lake
Baikal, and was present in that city during the whole of the prolonged
ceremonies connected

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

with the election and enthronement of Mangu, the fourth of the Great
Khans of the Mongols, and the grandson of Genghis Khan. About the same
time, Louis IX. (St. Louis) of France sent a similar embassy, which
arrived at Karakorum a little before the election of Mangu, and
presented its credentials and letters to the widow of the late Khan,
Gaiyuck, who was acting as Regent during the vacancy of the throne.
Three Dominicans (of whom one was Rubruquis) were charged with this
duty, but their embassy was scarcely a successful one, as the Mongols
interpreted it as an act of submission on the part of the French
monarch. Russian Princes were also compelled, as tributaries to the
Mongols, to make periodical journeys to the Court of the Mongol Khans;
amongst them were the sainted hero of the Russians, Alexander
Newsky, <span id="fr_466"></span>[1](#fn_464.md) and another brave man,
also canonized, a certain Michael, who preferred martyrdom at the hand
of the quick-tempered Mongols rather than bow his head before the
symbols of idolatry.

We have thus a very fair amount of information as to the state of the
Mongol Court in the days before the accession of Kublaï Khan, and the
singularly consistent information thus given is reinforced and confirmed
by the testimony of subsequent writers, such as Orpélian, John de
Mandeville, Marco Polo, and some Arabs.

All the accounts represent the Mongols as monotheists. There is one God
in Heaven, the Ruler and Judge of all, and there is One Sovereign upon
Earth, whose privilege it is to rule over the whole earth. <span
id="fr_467"></span>[2](#fn_465.md) "God in Heaven, the Khan upon Earth,"
was the motto which they engraved

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

upon their official seals, and to this short creed they expected and
exacted universal obedience. About further religious details they did
not trouble themselves very much. One of their Khans said that there
were as many ways of serving God as there were fingers upon a man's
hands, and provided that the Universal Sovereignty of the Khan was
acknowledged, they let men serve God in any way they liked. Nestorian
Christians were frequently found at their courts, in places of high
honour, and we sometimes read, in the pages of D’Ohsson and Karamsin, of
women in Mongol families receiving baptism; indeed, it was even said of
Sartac, son of Batu, who governed in Russia, that he was a Christian.
The Mongols, when they had once established their rule in Russia,
treated the Russian Church with kindness and consideration, and the
Metropolitan Cyril felt himself justified, says Karamsin, in appointing
an archbishop for those portions of Russia which had come under direct
Mongol rule, and in creating a special province to be under that
prelate's jurisdiction. <span id="fr_468"></span>[1](#fn_466.md) Constant
mention is made of Christian services held at the Great Khan's Court,
under the direct patronage of the Sovereign and his family.

This toleration led many in Europe to believe (the more readily because
the wish was, in this case, father to the thought) that the Khans of
Tartary were about to become Christians. <span
id="fr_469"></span>[2](#fn_467.md) This was, however, very far from the
truth. The Mongols had their own religion (which we have already
explained), with priests or magicians (*Kame*) of their own. These
priests guarded the avenues leading to the palace with magic rites and
ceremonies which all were expected

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

to treat with reverence. But they tolerated all faiths alike, and the
Buddhist and Mahometan had exactly the same privileges as the Nestorian,
or indeed any other species of Christian, if he was not hampered by a
belief in a Vicegerent of Heaven whose claims could clash with those of
the Mongol ruler. We are told that on certain occasions Christian,
Mahometan, and Buddhist priests would be admitted in quick succession to
bless the food of which the Great Khan was about to partake, and that
all were treated with absolute impartiality. It is possible (and indeed
Carpini expressly affirms it of the Nestorian priests) <span
id="fr_470"></span>[1](#fn_468.md) that there was not much of real religion
in any of these Court chaplains of various creeds. Religion was at a low
ebb everywhere throughout the Asiatic dominions of the Mongols,
otherwise this happy family arrangement could not have continued as it
did; one result, however, must have ensued from this strange
fraternization—the various religions must have learned a good deal about
one another from their close propinquity at the Court.

Another fact, about which all the writers are agreed who have written
about the Mongolian Court under the three or four immediate successors
of Genghis Khan, is that, in addition to priests and monks of the
various religions, there was a considerable number of lay persons from
many countries. We find mention of Frenchmen, Italians, Englishmen,
serving the Mongols in various capacities. <span
id="fr_471"></span>[2](#fn_469.md) Koreans were there, and Chinamen. It
seems hard to suppose that there were no Japanese. It was still the
practice of Japanese in those days to cross to China for purposes of
study and research, and the Mongols, living as they did on the northern
frontiers of the Celestial Empire, were looked upon as half Chinese,
long before Kublaï made

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

himself Emperor of China on the overthrow of the Sung dynasty. There
does not seem to have lurked in the Japanese mind any suspicion as to
Mongol designs until Nichiren's writings and preachings forced the
authorities to be on their guard against the danger. <span
id="fr_472"></span>[1](#fn_470.md)

If, therefore, we put all these considerations together, we shall see
that it is far from impossible that some of Abbot Joachim's speculations
may have been derived from the same sources which furnished the
religious writers of Japan with the materials for their speculations,
though through a different channel. There is a law of action and
re-action in the world of ideas as well as in more material spheres.

D’Ohsson (*op. cit.*, vol. ii. p. 265) tells us in a note that the
Mongols called the Christians *Arcaoun* or *Arkhaïoun*. I have not been
able to identify this word absolutely in the only Mongolian Dictionaries
accessible to me; but I venture to conjecture that it is the same word
as the Sanskrit Arhat, which appears in ordinary Japanese as *Rakan*,
but which Nichiren seems consistently to have written as *Arakan*. <span
id="fr_473"></span>[2](#fn_471.md) It is quite probable that the
Christianity of the Nestorians may have appeared to the Mongolians as
merely a variant form of Buddhism; for the Buddhism of Central Asia and
China embraced in its wide bosom a very varied assortment

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

of heterogeneous elements. Nichiren knew of the Shatparāmita
Sūtra, <span id="fr_474"></span>[1](#fn_472.md) referred to in a former
chapter, which was produced by the collaboration of the Nestorian priest
Adam with the Indian Buddhist Prajṇā, and he rejected it with
scorn. <span id="fr_475"></span>[2](#fn_473.md) Two centuries later, when
St. Francis Xavier landed in Kyushu and desired to preach the Faith of
Christ, he received from the local Daimyo a written permit authorizing
him to preach the doctrines of Buddha. <span
id="fr_476"></span>[3](#fn_474.md) It did not at first occur to the average
Japanese mind that the Faith which the Jesuit Fathers had come to preach
was anything more than a new variety of the multiplex Mahāyāna.

Kublaï was the first of the Mongol rulers who formally adopted Buddhism
as his own personal religion. It is to him that the world owes that
peculiar institution, the Dalai Lama, the Supreme Pope of the Thibetan
and Mongolian Buddhists. The first Dalai Lama was appointed in 1261, not
long after the visit of the Franciscan ambassadors from the Court of
Rome. Imitation is very often the sincerest form of flattery. But the
Dalai Lama and the Lamaist form of Buddhism has nothing to do with the
Japanese Mahāyāna. We may therefore content ourselves with the bare
mention of the fact of the institution. Kennyo Shōnin, one of Shinran's
successors in the fifteenth

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

century, is credited with having harboured designs of establishing
something very much like it in Japan <span
id="fr_477"></span>[1](#fn_475.md) for his own benefit.

It is of distinct importance for the student to keep in mind the
Buddhist conception of the three "millenniums," the last of which is to
witness the decay of the Faith taught by S’akyamuni. There is a tendency
to shirk the obvious conclusions of the doctrine as at first enunciated,
by expanding the third millennium to a period of two or even ten
thousand years. It is a tendency caused by fear. Buddhists not
unnaturally dread the coming of the time when their faith shall
disappear. There is another way of looking at the question. If it should
disappear it will do so only to make room for something better, and that
"something better" is what the whole world is prepared to welcome. I
shall refer to it again in my concluding chapter. <span

<span id="fn_461"></span>[330:3](chj28.htm#fr_463.md) It has pleased
certain Japanese writers to identify Genghis Khan with Yoshitsune, the
popular hero of the Minamoto, who disappears from Japanese history in
the year 1189, at the age of thirty-one. No proof can be given for the
assumption. It is made to rest on the Sinico-Japanese reading of the
name Minnamoto Yoshitsune, which is *Gen Gikyō*, a fair approximation to
*Genghis Khan*. Yoshitsune certainly had the same adventurous spirit
that is to be found in Gengis Khan and his descendants, and the
suggested identification is a very flattering one to certain Japanese
minds.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[335:2](chj28.htm#fr_467.md) The resemblance to
Nichiren's initial and oft-repeated sermon is striking. There is also a
general resemblance in the ecclesiastical policies of the Mongols and
Japanese which should be kept in mind.

"Chronological Notes on Buddhism in Japan," published in the
*Transactions* of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Natur and Volkerkunde
Ostasiens (Tokyo), mentions five or six priests who went over to China
during this period, some of whom made very long stays; and there were
probably others. Nichiren's information about the doings of the Mongols
was so very accurate that he must have had an informant who had seen
with his own eyes what he related.

Nichiren seems to have been almost pedantic in his use of Sanskrit words
rather than the popular Sinico-Japanese corruptions. Kowalewsky (vol. i.
pp. 144, 150) and Schmidt (p. 4, col. a) give a word, connected with the
Sanskrit *arhat*, which seems to be pronounced *archaiun*, and which
means "the saints."

<span id="fn_472"></span>[339:1](chj28.htm#fr_474.md) See above, Chapter

He says that the Sūtra was brought from India by Amoghavajra towards the
end of the Tang dynasty, that it was unknown in China until then, that
none of the teachers in the period of the "three Southern and seven
Northern States" knew anything about it, and that it was inconsistent
with the Hokekyō.

<span id="fn_474"></span>[339:3](chj28.htm#fr_476.md) Murdoch and Yamagata,
"History of Japan," p. 67. The licence runs as follows: "This deed
witnesseth that I have given permission to the priests (*sō*, a Buddhist
term) who have come to this country from the Western regions, in
accordance with their request and desire, that they may found and erect
a monastery and house, in order to develop the Law of Buddha."

<span id="fn_476"></span>[340:2](chj28.htm#fr_478.md) It is well to observe
the way in which persons and nations, dwelling in remote parts of the
world, and apparently without any dealings with one another, become, as
it were, simultaneously obsessed by the same ideas. We may find
illustrations of this in the development of Greek and Indian
philosophies, in the reforms of S’akyamuni as contemporaneous with those
of the post-exilic prophets and lawgivers, in the simultaneous
realization both in East and West of the need of a personal Saviour who
shall be of kingly race and born out of the common way of men.
Simultaneously, both in East and West is proclaimed the doctrine of
Salvation by Faith, of the approaching end of the age, of the need of
using the temporal sword for the suppression of heresy. We cannot always
trace an actual contact; it is perhaps enough to recognize the fact that
these thoughts were in the air.
