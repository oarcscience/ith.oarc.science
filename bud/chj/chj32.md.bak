### CHAPTER XXX.

<span class="smallcaps">Recapitulation</span>

<span class="smallcaps">It</span> shall be my pleasant task in this
concluding chapter to recapitulate for my reader all that I have put
before him in a long and rather prolix narration.

I would, first, call attention to the remarkable parallels between the
history of Christianity and that of the Buddhist Mahāyāna.

Both faiths begin in that marvellous sixth century before Christ, which
saw the beginnings of so much that has been for the benefit of mankind.
Philosophy began for man in Greece, in India, and in China. S’akyamuni
was founding a religion which, if not perfect, is at any rate one that
commands our most reverent sympathy and affection, and the later
exponents of Judaism, the exilic and post-exilic prophets and psalmists,
the teachers of the law, and the great Fathers of the later Faith of
Jerusalem, were distinctly raising the faith of Israel to a higher plane
in preparation for a great event to come.

The great event came. It came at the right moment for East and West. It
was like a stone flung into the midst of a large pool, that falls with a
mighty splash and sets up ripples which go forth equally on all sides,
and never rest till they break upon the distant margins. We have been
accustomed to watch the ripples that have gone out West and North from
the splash made in the world's religious history by the Advent of
Christ. We

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

have seen those ripples bringing new life to Europe, revivifying
philosophy and art, giving men nobler thoughts and aspirations, and
laying the foundations of that religion of humanity which is bound up
with the name of Christ.

I have tried in this book—tentatively and with the uncertain tread of a
pioneer going through untrodden brushwood—to trace the ripples that
flowed out eastward from the splash of the stone. Occasionally I have
seemed to myself to see the traces of Christ distinct and clear, though
few and far between, and not sufficient in number or quantity to allow
of anything very elaborate in the way of deduction and inference. But
during the whole of the first millennium of the Christian era, a period
corresponding very nearly with the millennium of Image Law of which
Buddhists speak, I find the same phenomena both East and West—a chaos of
heresies, each claiming to be heard as the sole exponent of the Truth,
and amidst them all one fact: the proclamation that there is one Being
who has given Himself for man, that man through Him might have life. The
proclamation in the West, in spite of heresies and in spite of the
manifold superstitions of a dark age, is clear and distinct. In the East
it is not so distinct; it is like a lotus-seed, sown deep down in the
slime at the bottom of the pool. It is there, and it grows, but it takes
some time to reach the surface.

With the end of the first millennium of Christendom comes the period
which the Buddhist knows as *Mappō*, the "last days," the period of the
"Destruction of the Law." As this period comes on, the Christian,
forgetting the spirit he is of, grasps the sword, for the conquest of
the Holy Land, for the extirpation of Albigenses and other heretics. So
does the Buddhist. It is the age of the great barrack monasteries, and
of the wars waged by the monks of Hieizan, Onjōji, Negoro, Hongwanji,
for the defence of

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

their supposed rights and the injury of their neighbour. In the midst of
this period, disciples of the inquisition-loving Nichiren, who was yet a
seer, find themselves brought face to face with the disciples of the
inquisition-loving St. Dominic, and the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries see in Japan the establishment of a permanent Inquisition. Yet
the same period sees the loud proclamation, so comforting to the outcast
and the sinner, of Salvation by Faith alone, through the mercies of One
whose compassion has from the first been known, though under different
names, to the Mahāyānist and to the Christian. St. Francis and Wiclif
(they will forgive me for thus coupling their names) are the Christian
counterparts of Hōnen and Shinran. The Schoolmen, too, whose labour it
was to reconcile Aristotle and Christ, find their counterparts in the
labours of the great Japanese scholars of the middle ages, who worked to
reconcile S’akyamuni and Confucius.

The first Christian millennium did not pass away without its warning of
impending change. The Moslem peril profoundly moved Christendom, the
same peril threatened China under the Tang. In both parts of the world,
the meaning of the warning was largely misread, as was, probably, the
similar warning of the Mongols, at the commencement of the second
millennium.

This second millennium, which is the Buddhist period of the Mappō, is
not yet finished; but may we not say that we have had the warning of an
impending change? A man of the eighteenth century, a man of science, a
dreamer, and yet a seer, amused his contemporaries by proclaiming that
the year 1757 had seen in "the heavenlies" a spiritual judgment which
was to be the precursor of a new Age and of a new Church. He brought no
proof for his assertion, except the testimony of one of his own visions,
and his testimony was rejected all but unanimously. And yet the

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

year 1757 saw the declaration of the Seven Years’ War, which brought in
its train the rise of Prussia, the unification of Germany, and all that
Germany stands for in the civilization of the world. It saw the
accession to power in England of the elder Pitt, and the commencement of
those operations against France which led to the conquest of Canada and
the ultimate securing of Anglo-Saxon supremacy on the Continent of North
America. It witnessed the battle of Plassey, which secured the British
supremacy in India, and for the first time in the world's history
enabled Eastern thought and Western to meet each other and compare
notes. If it had not been for Plassey there would have been no Oriental
studies, and possibly but few Christian Missions in India. It saw, in
France, those attacks on Christianity, led by Montesquieu, Rousseau, and
the Encyclopædists, which led to the French Revolution. It found the
Wesleys at the commencement of their labours. Surely it was a year full
of pregnant significance.

The significance becomes deeper for us, whose hearts are in Japan, when
we remember that it also found Kamo Mabuchi preparing to retire from his
active duties in order to devote himself to those historical studies
which ultimately led to the restoration of the Imperial House, and the
entry of Japan into the world of civilized nations.

The mills of God grind slowly. There is no hurry or haste in the
workings of Providence. A long time has passed since the Swedish seer
made his announcement, but to-day it needs no prophetic gift to tell us
that a new era is at hand, that the old is passing away, that a new day
dawns.

One thing never passes away. Heaven and Earth may change, the whole
political and social fabric of the world may perish, but God's Word will
not do so. Whatever form the new world may take, it will have a
religion, and that religion will be based on the Eternal Verities.

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

The Christian—I will claim nothing for myself but that—finds it to be
his duty, his pleasure, and his pride, to commend those Eternal
Verities, quietly, soberly, temperately, to the people amongst whom he
lives. And he must do it sympathetically, for the most eloquent sermon,
if devoid of sympathy, will necessarily fail to touch the heart of the
people.

Buddhism is the religion of the great bulk of the Japanese people. The
farmers are Buddhists, so are the shopkeepers, so are the rank and file
of the people. The ladies of the upper classes are Buddhists, so are
most of their husbands, if they will be honest with themselves. Buddhism
does not go well with the frock-coat and top hat which are the joy of
the Japanese gentleman, and so he affects to lay it aside as a thing
past use; but there comes to one and all a time when frock-coat and top
hat fail to protect the head and heart against the terrors of a change
inevitable and universal, and then I find that the Japanese turns after
all to the faith which he has spent his life in professing to neglect.
One has but to learn the Japanese language, and study the literature of
to-day's daily life, to understand what a hold Buddhism has on the
thoughts and affections of the people.

Christianity, if it would win Japanese Buddhism for Christ (and surely
that is an inspiring ambition), must take these things into
consideration. Buddhism needs its special preachers—men of sympathy and
patience; men who, while proud of being Christians, are yet willing for
Christ's sake, to be followers of S’akyamuni in all things lawful and
honest; men who can say to the Buddhist, "I will walk with you, and
together we will go to Him to whom you say S’akyamuni Himself bore
witness." It is for such readers, primarily, that I have ventured to
write this outline of Mahāyāna History.
