### CHAPTER III

<span class="smallcaps">The Buddha and his Greatest Disciple</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Thanks</span> to the labours of many students of
the Buddhist books, both Pali and Sanskrit, we are able to form a vivid
mind's eye picture of the ministerial life of the Founder of Buddhism;
indeed, the general indications of time are so wonderfully precise that
we can trace his labours year by year for quite one-half of the
forty-six years which his ministry occupied. There is a gap of about
fifteen years near the end of his career for which we have no precise
sequence of events; but even here we are not left entirely in the dark,
for there are many indications given of the troublous days through which
India in general, and the Buddhist community in particular, was then
passing. <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md)

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> We are shown the
successes which attended on S’akyamuni's first preaching. Conversions
were numerous and rapid, converts of all ages and both sexes flocked
into his community from every class of society, and were welcomed
without distinction of caste and rank. Thousands caught the enthusiasm
of the Buddha, and left all to follow him, while in the crowds who felt
no vocation to the monastic life were kings and merchants, who vied with
each other in the generosity of their gifts.

Among all these varied personages S’akyamuni moves like a king among
men. Bimbisara recognizes the kingship that is in him, and offers to
make him the Crown Prince of the Magadhan kingdom, S’akyan noblemen
herald hint as the teacher and saint of their clan; and the universal
esteem in which he is held is shown by nothing more strikingly than by
the settlement of a dispute about rights of water which is referred to
his arbitration by the tribes concerned. Evidently, the historical
Tathāgata was a practical person, far removed from the ecstatic dreamer
of the Hokekyū. <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md)

Religious India had need of a sound mind with a practical bent, for the
times were fraught with evil. Wars and rumours of war vexed the minds of
the people; there was civil strife in Magadha, and sounds of more
distant thunder came rolling over from Western Asia. All these hindered
"the running of the wheel;" so did

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

also the conflicts with heretics, the dissensions among the disciples,
and the many breaches of discipline which weakened the strength and
vigour of his Buddhist followers.

S’akyamuni was a brave man and strong, but he felt the dissensions among
his disciples most keenly, and there were many moments in which he sank
into the lowest pit of despondency, and which his biographers have
described as conflicts with the Evil One. These conflicts came at many
periods in his life; they cannot be said to have shortened his days, for
he lived to be over eighty, but they were evidently the result of the
sorrows and anxieties which embittered the later years of his
life. <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md)

The end had probably been drawing on for some time; strange to say, it
was hastened by a meal of dried boar's flesh, of which he partook in the
house of Chanda, the blacksmith—a proof that abstinence from flesh
cannot have been an integral portion of the early rules of
Buddhism. <span id="fr_26"></span>[2](#fn_26.md) His death has been very
touchingly described in the "Sūtra of the Great Decease," which gives us
also

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

his last words to his disciples, as well as the account of his
obsequies. The extent of his influence and the high esteem in which he
was held throughout Central Asia are shown by the eagerness with which
the surrounding tribes craved for a portion of his cremated bones for
purposes of reverence and adoration.

The evidence to hand seems to show that it was the strong ruling hand of
the master that alone was able to preserve the unity of the large number
of his disciples and followers in his later years. The Tathāgata had
been attended during his last moments by the well-beloved Ananda, the
disciple who had for some time been acting as his private secretary and
coadjutor; Kaśyapa, the most weighty of all the *Sthaviras*, or Seniors,
did not arrive in time to see his master again in life. When a Council
was summoned at Rajagriha soon after the interment, it was Kaśyapa who
took the chair, whilst Ananda, in spite of his intimate relations with
the master, found himself at first excluded altogether (Kern,
"Buddhism," vol. ii. p. 239). There is a northern tradition of a rival
Council held outside the Grotto, whilst the official Council within was
pursuing its labours. <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md) Other
traditions (see Kern, *l.c.*)

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

make the exclusion of Ananda from the official Council to have been but
temporary, but the fact remains that the successions of Patriarchs in
north and south were from the very beginning different. Both successions
begin with Kaśyapa, but both assign to him only a short tenure of
office. He was an old man, older than S’akyamuni, and most probably died
soon after his master. After Kaśyapa, we have, in the south, Upali the
Barber, who recited the Vinaya-pitakam; then Dāsaka, Sonaka, Siggava,
and Chandavajji, and Tishya Maudgalyāyaniputra, who is said to have
presided over As’oka's Council. In the north, during the same period, we
get Ananda, the coadjutor of Buddha and the reciter of the
Sūtra-pitakam; Madhyantika, the Apostle of Kashmir; S’ānavaśas, who was
present at the Second Council, Upagupta, who acted as guide to As’oka
when that monarch, in the interval between his conversion and his
ordination to the priesthood, made a tour of the holy places; <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md) and finally Dhītika, who, during the
period of missionary fervour which followed the Third Council under
As’oka (possibly even independently of that Council's authority), went
into Turkestan and there

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

became a successful apostle of Buddhism. <span
id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md) The two lists have no names in common,
except the first, and the northern histories ignore As’oka's Council.
The inference seems to be a legitimate one, that north and south were
independent of one another.

A second Council (for we must consider the meetings at Rājagriha to have
constituted but one Council) was held at Vaiśāli just about one hundred
years after the Parinirvana of the Master to settle some questions of
discipline which had arisen within the community of monks. Was it
permissible for the monks to keep a little salt in a horn, in case the
food supplied by the charitable should contain none? Was it permissible
to dine after midday, when the sun cast shadows more than two inches in
length? Was it permissible for brethren belonging to the same community
to keep the sabbaths separately? Might the brethren drink palm-wine, sit
on elaborate cushions, handle gold and silver, etc.? <span
id="fr_30"></span>[2](#fn_30.md) These and similar questions were brought
before the Council of Vaiśāli by the monks of Vaiśāli, who maintained
their lawfulness. We can see how strong was the current of party feeling
from the question about the sabbath. The opposing parties could
evidently no longer meet together for the joint celebration of the
customary observances, and the tension between the monks of the east and
west was very great. A leading part in the Synod was taken (Kern, vol.
ii. p. 248) by Yaśas, whose identification with S’ānavaśas, the Mahāyāna
patriarch, would, if accepted, <span id="fr_31"></span>[3](#fn_31.md)

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

show that the breach between Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna was not yet
definitely recognized. The decision went against the Vaiśāli monks, who
seem to have belonged chiefly to the proud Vrijji clan of S’akyans, and
from that moment Buddhism began to be hopelessly shattered by
ever-increasing schisms and divisions. <span
id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32.md)

Before a third Council was summoned, India had undergone the shock of
invasion, and Alexander's victorious arms had penetrated as far as the
Punjaub. The immediate effect on Buddhism of the Macedonian invasion was
not so great as might be imagined. <span id="fr_33"></span>[2](#fn_33.md)
When the Greek armies came to a check in the Punjaub, there were still
several hundreds of unconquered miles between them and the kingdom of
Magadha. The strictly Hellenistic influences came later: the immediate
effect lay in the shock and terror with which the weak princelets and
peoples of India must have viewed the advancing invader, and the despair
which must have paralyzed every one. With the sole exception of King
Pōrus, there does not

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

seem to have been a single native prince of any power or weight, and the
kingdom of Magadha was especially helpless under the rule of the
effeminate Nanda dynasty. A mere adventurer, the son of a barber, who
had found his way to Alexander's camp, conceived the bold idea of
raising himself to the throne which its feeble occupants left
practically unprotected. After trying in vain to engage Alexander in
further enterprises, Chandragupta bided his time till the conqueror's
death gave him the opportunity for action. Then a successful mutiny made
him master of the Punjaub, the possession of which secured for him the
command of the necessary sinews of war. A few months later we see him
master of Magadha, with a capital at Pataliputra and dominions extending
from the mouths of the Ganges to the Indus, from the Himalayas to the
Vindhya. Chandragupta was the founder of the so-called Mauryan dynasty;
he first defied Seleucus Nicator, and then entered into an alliance with
him, compacted by a marriage with the Greek king's daughter. It was to
his court that Megasthenes <span id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34.md) was sent
as minister resident of the Seleucid monarch, and it is to Megasthenes
that Europe owes its first just notions of India. Chandragupta was not a
Buddhist, and he has no importance for the historian of religions. He
is, nevertheless, a personage far too weighty to be passed over without
mention.

Chandragupta's grandson was the celebrated As’oka, who changed Buddhism
from the form of belief adopted by a few unimportant tribes in Central
India to a creed of world-wide importance. Chandragupta (B.C. 320–297)
was succeeded by his son Bindusara (297–272), a sovereign of whom very
little is known beyond the fact that he extended his dominions
considerably; that, whilst he was

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

on the throne, the King of Egypt sent an embassy, under a certain
Dionysus, to Pataliputra; and that on one occasion he wrote a letter to
Antiochus, King of Syria, asking to have a professor of Greek sent to
him. Greek writers speak of him as Ἀμιτροχάτης, a name which suggests
that he adopted the Sanskrit title *Amitraghāti*, "the slayer of his
foes." He was succeeded in B.C. 272 by his son As’oka, one of the
greatest of the rulers of India. Of As’oka we know that in his early
days he bore anything but a good reputation; indeed, it was said of him
that, like a traditional Oriental potentate, he waded to the throne
through the blood of his near kinsmen and their friends. His coronation,
for some unknown reason, was deferred for some two or three years after
his accession, a fact which inclines us to believe that in the early
years of his reign he may have met with a good deal of opposition. In
B.C. 261 he was engaged in a successful war with the Kalingas in
southern India, a war so full of horrors and misery that the
contemplation of it filled the conqueror with remorse and pity, and
caused his conversion, not necessarily to Buddhism, but at any rate to
religion. He soon took political measures for acquainting his subjects
with his change of views; and he has left us a series of edicts,
inscribed on rocks and pillars in different parts of India, which give
us our best insight into the character of his religious aspirations.
Whatever his religious views were, he was not ashamed to publish them
abroad, for he sent embassies <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md) to
many of the leading

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hellenic
sovereigns of Western Asia, and the treaty of amity which he concluded
with Antiochus Theos in B.C. 256 must have given him a much-desired
opportunity for impressing his beliefs on the Hellenic mind.

By the year 249 his mind was turning definitely towards the acceptance
of the teachings of S’akyamuni in preference to those of any other of
the religious teachers who laid claim to the allegiance of religious
India. He went on a solemn pilgrimage to the sacred places of India with
Upagupta, the patriarch of the Northern School, as his guide, and the
sight of the Lumbini grove, where S’akyamuni was born, of Bodhigaya,
where he attained to Enlightenment, of Benares, where the Wheel of the
Law was set in motion, and of the Sacred Grove, in which he died, moved
him apparently to a further step. In 240 he was ordained as a monk, and
in the Bhābhrā Edict, dated, soon after that, he proclaimed himself
definitely as a Buddhist. Between As’oka's ordination and his death
(which Vincent Smith assigns to B.C. 231) must be placed his Council,
the data for which are so confusing that writers like Kern have come to
the conclusion that it never took place at all, but was a mere figment
of chronologists and history-writers of the Southern School. Northern
Buddhism, it is true, knows nothing of As’oka's Council, but there is
nothing in this fact to justify a denial of its having taken place. It
is probable that the Council took place, and that it was an effort on
As’oka's part to procure reforms of abuses which had crept in during the
230 years which had elapsed since the death of the Founder. It is also
reasonable to suppose that he laboured at the Council for the promotion
of those views which he had so persistently advocated in the long
succession of rock edicts.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_23"></span>[18:1](chj05.htm#fr_23.md) Northern Buddhists
assign to the closing years of this period of silence the pronouncement
of two or three most important Sūtras. The "Saddharmapundarika Sūtra" is
said to have taken seven years to deliver in its fulness, and (as we
have seen) the three Sūtras relating to the Mercies and Vow of Amitābha
are all ascribed to this period. It is hard to believe that they can all
have come from the same mouth at about the same time, for in the one set
Amitābha is exalted to the highest of all places; in the other, he
occupies only a very inferior position. It seems certain that these
Sūtras in their present form were not composed until long after
S’akyamuni's time. It is possible, however, that in the case of Vaidehi,
the Queen of Bimbisara, S’akyamuni may actually have pointed the
distressed lady to the Mercies of Amitābha. That amongst the Kshatriyas
many monotheistic ideas were afloat about the period of S’akyamuni's
activity seems very probable. The worship given by the Bhāgavatis to
Krishna Vasudeva, which Dr. Grierson has treated of in *J.R.A.S*, is
very much akin to the cult of <span id="page_19">p. 19</span> Amitābha.
Clearly such conceptions as the unity of the Godhead and salvation by
faith were known in India at a very early date. The troubles in Magadha,
the civil wars which ended in the destruction of Kapilavastu, as well as
some of the conspiracies against S’akyamuni's life, all fall into this
"period of silence." Beyond the limits of India all Asia was in the
excitement of the great preparations for the expedition of Xerxes
against Greece. Dr. Maeda, in the appendix to "Bukkyō Seiten," gives a
very convenient chronology of S’akyamuni's life, which is probably,
however, based on the work of Western scholars.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[19:1](chj05.htm#fr_24.md) This is the Japanese
name for the "Saddharmapundarika Sūtra."

<span id="fn_25"></span>[20:1](chj05.htm#fr_25.md) I have heard a Buddhist
preacher draw a contrast between Buddha and Christ. The latter, he said,
lived all His life in the midst of enemies who were constantly seeking
opportunities to destroy Him. He was therefore perpetually in an
atmosphere of suspicion, fear, and danger, and the quiet and repose
which are so necessary for the teacher of religion, and which were so
conspicuous a feature in the life of S’akyamuni, were lacking in the
case of Christ. But a perusal of S’akyamuni's life, as it is given,
*e.g.*, in the pages of Kern's scholarly work on Buddhism, tends to show
that Buddha was a fighter quite as much as was our Lord or St. Paul, and
that there was in his ministerial life just as little of rest and
quietude as there was for Christ during His three years of similar
activities.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[20:2](chj05.htm#fr_26.md) The doctrine of
transmigration is given as one of the reasons for abstinence from animal
food. If S’akyamuni on this occasion deliberately partook of boar's
flesh, it will strengthen the position taken up by many that the
Twelvefold Chain of Causation implies, not transmigration or re-birth,
but heredity.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[21:1](chj05.htm#fr_27.md) In "Bukkyō Kakushū Kōyō"
(vol. i. fol. 1 and 2), a semi-official manual of Buddhism published in
Tokyo in the twenty-second year of Meiji (1889), mention is made of
three Councils, one within the grotto (<span id="img_02100"></span>
![](img/02100.jpg)) at Rajagriha, consisting of 500 arhats under the
presidency of Kaśyapa, which drew up the Canon of *three* Pitakas;
another outside the Grotto (<span id="img_02101"></span>
![](img/02101.jpg)), at which Bashika (<span id="img_02102"></span>
![](img/02102.jpg)) and others drew up a Canon of five Pitakas; and
again a third, a Council of the Mahāyāna, under the presidency of Ananda
and Maitreya (not to be confounded with the Buddha of the Future). The
two Hīnayāna Councils represent the Sthavira and Mahāsanghika
respectively; the third is possibly an invention of later times,
fabricated as a means of accounting for the existence of the Northern or
Mahāyāna Canon. This account is based on Hiouen Thsang (Kern). The *five
Pitakas* will be found in Nanjo's catalogue. They comprise nothing but
Mahāyāna Sūtras (no Vinaya or Abhidharma), there being in the <span
id="page_22">p. 22</span> Chinese Canon a special section for the
Hīnayāna Sūtras, and a miscellaneous section for Sūtras of later
addition. The five sections are: (i.) Prajnāpāramitā, 22 works; (ii.)
Ratna Kūta, 37; (iii.) Mahāsannipāta, 27; (iv.) Avatamsaka or Kegon, 35;
and (v.) Nirvana, 12. It seems probable that these sections represent
each the books cultivated by a particular school, sect, or country, and
that they have thus been grouped together so as to preserve the
characteristic features of the different schools. Thus the Amitābha
books fall entirely into the Ratnakūta class, etc. Strange to say, the
Saddharmapundarika, which plays so important a part in Japanese
Buddhism, is classed among the miscellaneous Sūtras of later addition.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[22:1](chj05.htm#fr_28.md) According to the Record
of the Transmission of the Dharmapitaka (Nanjo Cat. Trip., No. 1340),
both Dhītika and his successor Micchaka laboured in Turkestan, their
activities coming somewhat after the times of As’oka.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[23:1](chj05.htm#fr_29.md) This tour, according to
the Chinese (see Prof. Pelliot in *Bulletin de l’École Française de
l’Extrēme Orient*), extended as far as to Wu-tai-shan in North China,
the traditional home of the mythological Manjuśri.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[23:2](chj05.htm#fr_30.md) These are technically
known as the *Ten Indulgences*.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[23:3](chj05.htm#fr_31.md) Whilst some traditions
seem to identify the two, the authorities quoted by Kern treat them as
distinct persons, and represent Yaśas as <span id="page_24">p. 24</span>
appealing to S’ānavaśas for his advice and assistance. But the accounts
are hopelessly inconsistent and confusing. *Kāla As’oka* was the king
under whom the Council met.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[24:1](chj05.htm#fr_32.md) Murakami, in his
"Handbook of Buddhism," gives the 18 Hīnayāna sects immediately after
the Second Council. A fuller list will be found in *J.R.A.S* for
January, 1892, p. 5. It is impossible and un-advisable to burden the
memory with what are after all mere names, though some of the sects, the
Dharmaguptas, for instance, and the Sarvāstivādins, appear frequently in
Chinese Buddhism. The followers of the two Vehicles lived side by side
for several centuries after Christ: sometimes we have cases of a teacher
following the Mahāyāna in his theological speculations, and the Hīnayāna
in his tenets on discipline.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[24:2](chj05.htm#fr_33.md) It would almost seem as
though, in the interval between the Parinirvana of S’akyamuni and the
accession of As’oka, Buddhism in India had lost a great deal of ground,
and that it was the patronage of As’oka only that saved S’akyamuni from
the oblivion which befel his predecessors in the Buddhaship. Megasthenes
describes Brahmanic religious rites and life, but is practically silent
about Buddhism.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[25:1](chj05.htm#fr_34.md) Megasthenes was the
author of a book, still extant, which gives a very detailed account of
the life at the court of Chandragupta.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[26:1](chj05.htm#fr_35.md) These embassies must
have been sent in the early part of his reign, soon after his conversion
to religion. One of the kings thus approached was Magas, King of Cyrene,
who died in B.C. 258. One can see a possible reason for the alliances
between As’oka and Antiochus Theos in the fact that the year B.C. 256,
in which it was concluded, also saw the establishment of the Parthian
kingdom of the Arsacides, and the revolt of Bactria under Diodotus. In
such a crisis the friendship of As’oka, who was practically sole ruler
of Hindustan (as may be gathered from <span id="page_27">p. 27</span>
the locations of the inscriptions), must have been of paramount
importance to the Seleucid government.
