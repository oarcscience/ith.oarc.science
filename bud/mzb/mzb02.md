# II. THE DHARANIS

Properly speaking, the dharani has no legitimate place in Zen. That it
has nevertheless crept into its daily service is clue to the general
characteristics of Chinese Buddhism of the Sung dynasty, when the
Japanese Zen masters visited China and imported it as they found it
then, together with the Shingon elements of Chinese Zen. In China the
Shingon did not thrive very long but left its traces in Zen.

Dharani, the root of which is *dhr*, "to hold" or "to convey", is
ordinarily translated by the Chinese *tsung-ch'ih*, "general holder", at
*neng-ch'ih*, "that which holds". A dharani is considered as holding
magical power in it or bearing deep meaning. When it is pronounced,
whatever evil spirits there are ready to interfere with the spiritual
effect of a ritual, are kept away from it.

In the following pages the three most frequently read dharanis are
given. When translated they convey no intelligent signification. They
mostly consist of invocations and exclamations. The invocation is an
appeal to the higher powers, and the exclamation is to frighten away the
evil spirits. That the practical result of these utterances is not to be
judged objectively goes without saying.

pure in his self-nature, cleansed of the darkness of the five paths of
existence!

Turn us away \[from evils\] O one who enjoys a purified life!  
O one who empowers us with \[the power of\] the original covenant! O
jewel, jewel, the great jewel! O Suchness which is reality-limit and
absolute purity!  
O one who is pure in his evolved enlightenment!  
Be victorious, be victorious, be ever victorious, be ever victorious!  
Bear in mind, bear in mind!  
O one who is pure being empowered by all Buddhas!  
O Vajragarbha who holds the Vajra! Let my body be like Vajra! Let those
of all beings too be like Vajra!  
O one who is in possession of an absolutely pure body! O one who is
absolutely pure from all the paths of existence! And let me be consoled

enlightened, have them ever enlightened!
