# EDITOR'S FOREWORD TO SECOND EDITION

Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, D.Litt., Professor of Buddhist Philosophy in the
Otani University, Kyoto, was born in 1870. He is probably now the
greatest living authority on Buddhist philosophy, and is certainly the
greatest authority on Zen Buddhism. His major works in English on the
subject of Buddhism number a dozen or more, and of his works in Japanese
as yet unknown to the West there are at least eighteen. He is, moreover,
as a chronological bibliography of books on Zen in English clearly
shows, the pioneer teacher of the subject outside Japan, for except for
Kaiten Nukariya's *Religion of the Samurai* (Luzac and Co., 1913)
nothing was known of Zen as a living experience, save to the readers of
The Eastern Buddhist (1921-1939), until the publication of Essays in Zen
Buddhism (Volume I) in 1927.

Dr. Suzuki writes with authority. Not only has he studied original works
in Sanskrit, Pali, Chinese and Japanese, but he has an up-to-date
knowledge of Western thought in German and French as well as in the
English which he speaks and writes so fluently. He is, moreover, more
than a scholar; he is a Buddhist. Though not a priest of any Buddhist
sect, he is honoured in every temple in Japan, for his knowledge of
spiritual things, as all who have sat at his feet bear witness, is
direct and profound. When he speaks of the higher stages of
consciousness he speaks as a man who dwells therein, and the impression
he makes on those who enter the fringes of his mind is that of a man who
seeks for the intellectual symbols wherewith to describe a state of
awareness which lies indeed "beyond the intellect".

To those unable to sit at the feet of the Master his writings must be a
substitute. All these, however, were Out of print in England by 1940,
and all remaining stocks in Japan were destroyed in the fire which
consumed three-quarters of Tokyo in 1945. When, therefore, I reached
Japan in 1946, I arranged with the author for the Buddhist Society,
London--my wife and myself as its nominees--to begin the publication of
his Collected Works, reprinting the old favourites, and printing as fast
as possible translations of the many new works which the Professor,
self-immured in his house at Kyoto, had written during the war.

This undertaking, however, was beyond the powers of the Buddhist
Society, and we therefore secured the assistance of Rider and Co., who,
backed by the vast resources of the House of Hutchinson, can honour the
needs of such a considerable task.

Of Zen itself I need say nothing here, but the increasing sale of books
on the subject, such as The Spirit of Zen by Alan Watts (Murray), and
the series of original translations of Chinese Zen Scriptures and other
works published by the Buddhist Society prove that the interest of the
West is rising rapidly. Zen, however, is a subject extremely easy to
misunderstand, and it is therefore important that the words of a
qualified Master should come readily to hand.

# EDITOR'S NOTE TO SECOND EDITION

All references to the Author's Essays in Zen Buddhism, Series One and
Two, and to his Introduction to Zen Buddhism, are to the second edition
of these works, published in "The Complete Works of D. T. Suzuki."

# PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION

In my Introduction to Zen Buddhism (published 1934), an outline of Zen
teaching is sketched, and in The Training of the Zen Monk (1934) a
description of the Meditation Hall and its life is given. To complete a
triptych the present Manual has been compiled. The object is to inform
the reader of the various literary materials relating to the monastery
life. Foreign students often express their desire to know about what the
Zen monk reads before the Buddha in his daily service, where his
thoughts move in his leisure hours, and what objects of worship he has
in the different quarters of his institution. This work will partly, it
is hoped, satisfy their desire. Those who find my Essays too bulky or
too elaborate may prefer these smaller works on Zen.
