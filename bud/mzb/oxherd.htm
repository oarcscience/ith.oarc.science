<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Ten Oxherding Pictures</H1>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">From The Manual of Zen Buddhism, D.T. Suzuki</H2>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">By Shubun (15th Century)</H3>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">1. Undisciplined</H4>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">With his horns fiercely projected in the air the beast snorts,<BR>
Madly running over the mountain paths, farther and farther he goes astray!<BR>
A dark cloud is spread across the entrance of the valley,<BR>
And who knows how much of the fine fresh herb is trampled under his wild hoofs!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_bull02"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/bull02.jpg"> </P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">2. Discipline Begun</H4>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">I am in possession of a straw rope, and I pass it through his nose,<BR>
For once he makes a frantic attempt to run away, but he is severely whipped and whipped;<BR>
The beast resists the training with all the power there is in a nature wild and ungoverned,<BR>
But the rustic oxherd never relaxes his pulling tether and ever-ready whip.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_bull03"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/bull03.jpg"> </P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">3. In Harness</H4>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gradually getting into harness the beast is now content to be led by the nose,<BR>
Crossing the stream, walking along the mountain path, he follows every step of the leader;<BR>
The leader holds the rope tightly in his hand never letting it go,<BR>
All day long he is on the alert almost unconscious of what fatigue is.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_bull04"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/bull04.jpg"> </P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">4. Faced Round</H4>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">After long days of training the result begins to tell and the beast is faced round,<BR>
A nature so wild and ungoverned is finally broken, he has become gentler;<BR>
But the tender has not yet given him his full confidence,<BR>
He still keeps his straw rope with which the ox is now tied to a tree.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_bull05"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/bull05.jpg"> </P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">5. Tamed</H4>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Under the green willow tree and by the ancient mountain stream,<BR>
The ox is set at liberty to pursue his own pleasures;<BR>
At the eventide when a grey mist descends on the pasture,<BR>
The boy wends his homeward way with the animal quietly following.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_bull06"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/bull06.jpg"> </P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">6. Unimpeded</H4>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">On the verdant field the beast contentedly lies idling his time away,<BR>
No whip is needed now, nor any kind of restraint;<BR>
The boy too sits leisurely under the pine tree,<BR>
Playing a tune of peace, overflowing with joy.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_bull07"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/bull07.jpg"> </P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">7. Laissez Faire</H4>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The spring stream in the evening sun flows languidly along the willow-lined bank,<BR>
In the hazy atmosphere the meadow grass is seen growing thick;<BR>
When hungry he grazes, when thirsty he quaffs, as time sweetly slides,<BR>
While the boy on the rock dozes for hours not noticing anything that goes on about him.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_bull08"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/bull08.jpg"> </P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">8. All Forgotten</H4>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The beast all in white now is surrounded by the white clouds,<BR>
The man is perfectly at his ease and care-free, so is his companion;<BR>
The white clouds penetrated by the moon-light cast their white shadows below,<BR>
The white clouds and the bright moon-light-each following its course of movement.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_bull09"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/bull09.jpg"> </P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">9. The Solitary Moon</H4>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Nowhere is the beast, and the oxherd is master of his time,<BR>
He is a solitary cloud wafting lightly along the mountain peaks;<BR>
Clapping his hands he sings joyfully in the moon-light,<BR>
But remember a last wall is still left barring his homeward walk.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_bull10"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/bull10.jpg"> </P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">10. Both Vanished</H4>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Both the man and the animal have disappeared, no traces are left,<BR>
The bright moon-light is empty and shadowless with all the ten-thousand objects in it;<BR>
If anyone should ask the meaning of this,<BR>
Behold the lilies of the field and its fresh sweet-scented verdure.</P>
