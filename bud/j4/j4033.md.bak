*"A black, black hound," etc.* This story the Master told while dwelling
at Jetavana, about living for the benefit of the world.

One day, they say, the Brethren as they sat in the Hall of Truth, were
talking together. "Sirs," one would say, "the Master, ever practising
friendship towards the multitudes of the people, has forsaken an
agreeable abode, and lives just for the good of the world. He has
attained supreme wisdom, yet of his own accord takes bowl and robe, and
goes on a journey of eighteen leagues or more. For the Five Elders <span
id="fr_156"></span>[1](#fn_151.md) he set a-rolling the Wheel of the Law;
on the fifth day of the half-month he recited the Anattalakkhaṇa
Scriptures, and bestowed sainthood upon them all; he went to
Uruveḷa <span id="fr_157"></span>[2](#fn_152.md), and to the ascetics with
matted hair he showed miracles three thousand and half a thousand, and
persuaded them to join the Order; at Gayāsīsa <span
id="fr_158"></span>[3](#fn_153.md) he recited the Discourse upon Fire, and
bestowed sainthood upon a thousand of these ascetics;

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

to Mahākassapa <span id="fr_159"></span>[1](#fn_154.md), when he had gone
forward three miles to meet him, after three discourses he gave the
higher Orders; all alone, after the noon-day meal, he went a journey of
forty-five leagues, and then established in the Fruit of the Third Path
Pukkusa (a youth of very good birth); to meet Mahākappina <span
id="fr_160"></span>[1](#fn_154.md) he went forward a space of two thousand
leagues, and bestowed sainthood upon him; alone, in the afternoon he
went a journey of thirty leagues, and established in sainthood that
cruel and harsh man Aṅgulimāla <span id="fr_161"></span>[2](#fn_155.md);
thirty leagues also he traversed, and established Ālavaka <span
id="fr_162"></span>[3](#fn_156.md) in the Fruit of the First Path, and
saved the prince; in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three he dwelt three
months, and taught full comprehension of the Law to eight hundred
millions of deities <span id="fr_163"></span>[4](#fn_157.md); to Brahma's
world he went, and destroyed the false doctrine of Baka Brahma <span
id="fr_164"></span>[5](#fn_158.md), and bestowed sainthood on ten thousand
Brahmas; every year he goes on pilgrimage in three districts, and to
such men as are capable of receiving, he gives the Refuges, the Virtues,
and the fruits of the different stages; \[181\] he even acts for the
good of snakes and garuḷa birds and the like, in many ways." In such
words they praised the goodness and worth of the Dasabala's life for the
good of the world. The Master came in, and asked what they talked of as
they sat there? They told him. "And no wonder, Brethren," said he. "I
who now in my perfect wisdom would live for the world's good, even I in
the past, in the days of passion, lived for the good of the world." So
saying, he told a story of the past.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time, in the days of the Supreme Buddha Kassapa, there
reigned a king named Usīnara. It was a long time after the Supreme
Buddha Kassapa had declared the Four Truths, and liberated multitudes of
people from bondage, and had been translated to swell the number of
those who dwell in Nirvana; and the religion had fallen into decay. The
Brethren gained their livelihood in the twenty-one unlawful ways <span
id="fr_165"></span>[6](#fn_159.md); they associated with the Sisters, and
sons and daughters were born to them; Brethren forsook the duties of the
Brotherhood, and Sisters forsook the duties of Sisters, lay Brethren and
Sisters the duties of such, brahmins did no longer the duties of a
brahmin: men for the most part followed the ten paths of evil-doing, and
as they died thus filled the hosts of all states of suffering.

Then Sakka, observing that no new deities came into being, looked abroad
upon the world; and then he perceived how men were born into states of
suffering, and that the religion of the Buddha had decayed. "What shall
I do, now?" he wondered.—"Ah, I have it!" thought he: "I will scare and
terrify mankind; and when I see they are terrified,

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I will console
them, I will declare the Law, I will restore religion which has decayed,
I will make it last for another thousand years!" With this resolve, he
made the god Mātali <span id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_160.md) into the shape
of a huge black hound, of pure breed, having four tusks as big as a
plantain, horrible, with a hideous shape and a fat belly, as of a woman
ready to be delivered of a child; him fastening with five-fold chain,
\[182\] and putting on him a red wreath, he led by a cord. Himself he
put on a pair of yellow garments, and bound his hair behind his head,
and donned a red wreath; taking a huge bow, fitted with bowstring of the
colour of coral, and twirling in his fingers a javelin tipt with
adamant, he assumed the aspect of a forester, and descended at a spot
one league away from the city. "The world is doomed to destruction, is
doomed to destruction!" he called out thrice with a loud sound, so that
he terrified the people; and when he reached the entering in of the
city, he repeated the cry. The people on seeing the hound were
frightened, and hasted into the city, and told the king what had
happened. The king speedily caused the city gates to be closed. But
Sakka overleapt the wall, eighteen cubits in height, and with his hound
stood within the city. The people in terror ran away into the houses,
and made the doors fast. Big Blackie gave chase to every man he saw, and
scared them, and finally entered into the king's palace. The people who
in their fright had taken refuge in the courtyard, ran into the palace,
and shut to the door. And as for the king, he with the ladies of his
household went up on the terrace. Big Blackie raised his forefeet, and
putting them in at the window roared a great roar The sound of his
roaring reached from hell to the highest heaven: the whole universe was
one great roar. The three great roars that were the loudest ever heard
in India are these: the cry of king Puṇṇaka in the Puṇṇaka <span
id="fr_167"></span>[2](#fn_161.md) Birth, the cry of the snake-king
Sudassana in the Bhūridatta Birth <span id="fr_168"></span>[3](#fn_162.md),
and this roar in the Mahā-Kaṇha Birth, or the story of Big Blackie <span
id="fr_169"></span>[4](#fn_163.md). The people were terrified and
horrified, and not a man of them could say a word to Sakka.

The king plucked up heart, and approaching the window, cried out to
Sakka—"Ho, huntsman! \[183\] why did your hound roar?" Quoth he, "The
hound is hungry." "Well," said the king, "I will order some food to be
given him." So he told them to give him his own food, and the food of
all his household. The hound seemed to make but one mouthful of the
whole, then roared again. Again the king put his question. "My hound is
still hungry," was the reply. Then he had all the food of

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

his elephants and horses and so forth brought and given to him. This
also he finished off all at once; and then the king had all the food in
the city given him. He swallowed this in like manner, and roared again.
Said the king, "This is no hound. Beyond all doubt he is a goblin. I
will ask him wherefore he is come." So terrified with fear, he asked his
question by repeating the first stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"A black, black hound, with five cords bound, with fangs all white of
hue,  
Majestic, awful—mighty one! what makes he here with you?"

</div>

On hearing this, Sakka repeated the second stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Not to hunt game the Black Hound came, but he shall be of use  
To punish men, Usīnara, when I shall let him loose."

</div>

Then said the king, "What, huntsman! will the hound devour the flesh of
all men, \[184\] or of your enemies only?" "Only my enemies, great
king." "And who are your enemies?" "Those, O king, who love
unrighteousness, and walk wickedly." "Describe them to us," he asked.
And the king of the gods described them in the stanzas:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"When the false Brethren, bowl in hand, in one robe clad, shall choose  
Tonsured the plough to follow, then the Black Hound I will loose.

"When Sisters of the Order shall in single robe be found,  
Tonsured, yet walking in the world, I will let loose the Hound.

"What time ascetics, usurers, protruding the upper lip,  
Foul-toothed and filthy-haired shall be—the Black Hound I'll let slip.

"When brahmins, skilled in sacred books and holy rites, shall use  
Their skill to sacrifice for pelf, the Black Hound shall go loose.

"Whoso his parents now grown old, their youth now come to an end,  
Would not maintain, although he might <span
id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_164.md), gainst him the Hound I'll send.

"Who to his parents now grown old, their youth now come to an end,  
Cries, Fools are ye! gainst such as he the Black Hound I will send.

"When men go after others' wives, of teacher, or of friend,  
Sister of father, uncle's wife, the Black Hound I will send.

"When shield on shoulder, sword in hand, full-armed as highway men  
They take the road to kill and rob, I'll loose the Black Hound then.

"When widows' sons, with skin groomed white, in skill all useless
found,  
Strong-armed, shall quarrel and shall fight, then I will loose the
Hound.

"When men with hearts of evil full, false and deceitful men,  
Walk in and out the world about, I'll loose the Black Hound then."

</div>

\[186\] When he had thus spoken, "These," said he, "are my enemies, O
king!" and he made as though he would let the hound leap forth and
devour all those who did the deeds of enemies. But as all the multitude
was terror-struck, he held in the hound by the leash, and seemed as

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

it were to fix him to the spot;. then putting off the disguise of a
hunter, by his power he rose and poised himself in the air, all blazing
as it appeared, and said: "O great king, I am Sakka king of the gods!
Seeing that the world was about to be destroyed, I came hither. Now
indeed men as they die are filling the states of suffering, because
their deeds are evil, and heaven is become empty. From henceforth I will
know how to deal with the wicked, but do you be vigilant." Then having
in four stanzas well worth remembering declared the Law, and established
the people in the virtues of liberality, he strengthened the waning
power of religion so that it lasted for yet another thousand years, and
then with Mātali returned to his own place.

When the Master had ended this discourse, he added: "Thus, Brethren, in
former times as now I have lived for the good of the world;" and then he
identified the Birth: "At that time Ānanda was Mātali, and I was Sakka."
