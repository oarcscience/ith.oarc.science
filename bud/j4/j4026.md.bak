#### SAṀVARA-JĀTAKA.

*"Your nature, mighty monarch," etc.* This story the Master told while
dwelling in Jetavana, about a Brother who had ceased to strive. This, we
learn, was a young man of family, who lived in Sāvatthi. Having heard
the Master's discoursing, he renounced the world. Fulfilling the tasks
imposed by his teachers and preceptors, he learnt by heart both
divisions of the Pātimokkha.

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> When five years
were past, he said, "When I have been instructed in the mode of
attaining the mystic trance, I will go dwell in the forest." Then he
took leave of his teachers and preceptors, and proceeded to a frontier
village in the kingdom of Kosala. The people were pleased with his
deportment, \[131\] and he made a hut of leaves and there was attended
to. Entering upon the rainy season, zealous, eager, striving in
strenuous endeavour he strove after the mystic trance for the space of
three months: but of this not a trace could he produce. Then he thought:
"Verily I am the most devoted to worldly conditions <span
id="fr_107"></span>[1](#fn_105.md) among the four classes of men taught by
the Master! What have I to do with living in the forest?" Then he said
to himself, "I will return to Jetavana  <span
id="fr_108"></span>[2](#fn_106.md), and there in beholding the beauty of
the Tathāgata, and hearing his discourse sweet as honey, I will pass my
days." So he relaxed his striving; and setting forth he came in course
of time to Jetavana. His preceptors and teachers, his friends and
acquaintances asked him the cause of his coming. He informed them, and
they reproved him for it, asking him why he had so done. Then they led
him into the Master's presence. "Why, Brethren," said the Master, "do
you lead hither a Brother against his will?" They replied, "This Brother
has come hither because he has relaxed his striving." "Is this true, as
they tell me?" asked the Master. "Yes, Sir," said the man. Said the
Master, "Why have you ceased to strive, Brother? For a weak and slothful
man there is in this religion no high fruition, no sainthood: they only
who make strenuous effort accomplish this. In days long gone by you were
full of strength, easy to teach: and in this way, though the youngest of
all the hundred sons of the king of Benares, by holding fast to the
admonition of wise men you obtained the White Umbrella." So saying, he
told a story of the past.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the youngest of
his hundred sons was named Prince Saṁvara. The king gave his sons in
charge each of a separate courtier, with directions to teach them each
what they ought to learn. The courtier who instructed the Prince Saṁvara
was the Bodhisatta, wise, learned, filling a father's place to the
king's son. As each of the sons was educated, the courtiers brought them
for the king to see. The king gave them each a province, and let them
go.

When the Prince Saṁvara had been perfected in all learning, he asked the
Bodhisatta, "Dear father, if my father sends me to a province, what am I
to do?" He replied, "My son, when a province is offered you, you should
refuse it, and say, My lord, I am the youngest of all: if I go too,
there will be no one about your feet: I will remain where I am, at your
feet." Then one day, when Prince Saṁvara had saluted him, and was
standing on one side, the king asked him, "Well, my son, have you
finished your learning?" "Yes, my lord." "Choose a province." "My lord,
\[132\] there will be emptiness about your feet: let me remain here at
your feet, and in no other place!" The king was pleased, and consented.

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

After that he remained there at the king's feet; and again asked the
Bodhisatta, "What else am I to do, father?" "Ask the king," said he,
"for some old park." The prince complied, and asked for a park: with the
fruits and flowers that there grew he made friends with the powerful men
in the city. Again he asked what he was to do. "Ask the king's leave, my
son," said the Bodhisatta, "to distribute the food-money within the
city." So he did, and without the least neglect of any person he
distributed the food-money within the city. Again he asked the
Bodhisatta's advice, and after soliciting the king's consent,
distributed food within the palace to the servitors and the horses and
to the army, without any omission: to messengers come from foreign
countries he assigned their lodging and so forth, for merchants he fixed
the taxes, all that had to be arranged he did alone. Thus following the
advice of the Great Being, he made friends with every body, those in the
household and those without, all in the city, the subjects of the
kingdom, strangers, by his winsomeness binding them to him as it were by
a band of iron: to all of them he was dear and beloved.

When in due time the king lay on his deathbed, the courtiers asked him,
"When you are dead, my lord, to whom shall we give the White Umbrella?"
"Friends," said he, "all my sons have a right to the White Umbrella. But
you may give it to him that pleases your mind." So after his death, and
when the obsequies had been performed, on the seventh day they gathered
together, and said: "Our king bade us give the Umbrella to him that
pleases our mind. He that our mind desires is Prince Saṁvara." Over him
therefore they uplifted the White Umbrella with its festoons of gold,
escorted by his kinsmen.

The Great King Saṁvara cleaving to the advice of the Bodhisatta reigned
in righteousness.

The other ninety and nine princes heard that their father was dead, and
that the Umbrella had been uplifted over Saṁvara. \[133\] "But he is the
youngest of all," said they; "the Umbrella does not belong to him. Let
us uplift the Umbrella over the eldest of us all." They all joined
forces, and sent a letter to Saṁvara, bidding him resign the Umbrella or
fight; then they surrounded the city. The king told this news to the
Bodhisatta, and asked what he was to do now. He answered: "Great King,
you must not fight with your brothers. Divide the treasure belonging to
your father into a hundred portions, and to your brothers send
ninety-nine of them, with this message, "Accept this share of your
father's treasure, for fight with you I will not." So he did.

Then the eldest of all the brothers, Prince Uposatha by name, summoned
the rest together, and said to them, "Friends, there is no one able to
overcome the king; and this our youngest brother, though he has been our
enemy, does not remain so: but he sends us his wealth, and refuses to

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

fight with us. Now we cannot all uplift the Umbrella at the same moment;
let us uplift it over one only, and let him alone be king; so when we
see him, we will hand over the royal treasure to him, and return to our
own provinces." Then all these princes raised the siege of the city, and
entered it, foes no longer. And the king told his courtiers to welcome
them, and sent them to meet the princes. The princes with a great
following entered on foot, and mounting the steps of the palace, and
using all humility towards the great king Saṁvara, sat down in a lowly
place. King Saṁvara was seated under the White Umbrella upon a throne:
great magnificence was his, and great pomp; what place soever he looked
upon, trembled and quaked. Prince Uposatha seeing the magnificence of
the mighty king Saṁvara, thought to himself, "Our father, methinks, knew
that Prince Saṁvara would be king after his decease, and therefore gave
us provinces and gave him none;" then addressing him, repeated three
stanzas:

\[134\] <span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Your nature, mighty monarch, sure the lord of men well knew:  
The other princes honoured he, but nothing gave to you.

"While the king lived was it, or when a god to heaven he went,  
That seeing their own benefit, your kinsmen gave consent?

"Say by what power, O Saṁvara, you stand above your kin:  
Why do your brethren not unite from you the place to win?"

</div>

On hearing this, King Saṁvara repeated six stanzas to explain his own
character:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Because, O prince, I never grudge great sages what is meet:  
Ready to pay them honour due, I fall before their feet.

"Me envying none, and apt to learn all conduct meet and right,  
Wise sages each good precept teach in which they take delight.

"I listen to the bidding of these sages great and wise:  
My heart is bent to good intent, no counsel I despise.

"Elephant troops and chariotmen, guard royal, infantry—  
I took no toll of daily dole, but paid them all their fee.

"Great nobles and wise counsellors waiting on me are found;  
With food, wine, water (so they boast) Benares doth abound.

\[135\] "Thus merchants prosper, and from many a realm they come and
go,  
And I protect them. Now the truth, Uposatha, you know."

</div>

Prince Uposatha listened to this account of his character, and then
repeated two stanzas:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Then be above your kith and kin, and rule in righteousness,  
So wise and prudent, Saṁvara, your brethren you shall bless.

"Your treasure-heaps your brethren will defend, and you shall be  
Safe from your foes as Indra's self from his arch enemy <span
id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_107.md)."

</div>

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

\[136\] King Saṁvara gave great honour to all his brothers. They
remained with him a month and half a month; then they said to him,
"Great King, we would go and see if there be any brigands afoot in our
provinces; all happiness to your rule!" They departed each to his
province. And the king abode by the admonition of the Bodhisatta, and at
the end of his days went to swell the hosts of heaven.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Master, having finished this discourse, added, "Long ago, Brother,
you followed instruction, and why do you not now sustain your effort?"
Then he declared the Truths and identified the Birth: (now at the
conclusion of the Truths this Brother was established in the fruit of
the First Path:) "At that time this Brother was the great king Saṁvara,
Sāriputta was Prince Uposatha, the Elders and secondary Elders were the
other brothers, the Buddha's followers were their followers, and I
myself was the courtier who advised the king."
