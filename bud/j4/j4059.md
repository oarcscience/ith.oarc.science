*"The righteous king," etc.*—This story the Master told while dwelling
in Jetavana, about a gift incomparable. This has been explained in the
Sucira <span id="fr_348"></span>[2](#fn_340.md) Birth of the Eighth Book.
We learn that the king, while making this distribution of gifts,
examined five hundred Brethren with the Master their chief, and gave to
the most holy saints among them. Then they sat talking in the Hall of
Truth, and telling of his goodness thus: "Brother, the king, in giving
the incomparable gift, gave it in a case of much merit." The Master,
entering, would know what they talked of sitting there: and they told
him. Said he: "’Tis no wonder, Brethren, \[361\] that the King of
Kosala, being the follower of such as I am, gives with discrimination.
Wise men of old, ere yet the Buddha had arisen, even they gave with
discrimination." With these words, he told them a story of the past.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Kuru and the city called Indapatta,
was reigning a king Koravya, of the stock of Yuddhiṭṭhila. His adviser
in things temporal and spiritual was a minister named Vidhūra. The king,
with his great almsgiving, set all India in a commotion; but amongst all
those who received and enjoyed these gifts, not one there was who kept
so much as the Five Virtues: all were wicked to a man, and the king's
giving brought him no satisfaction. The king thought, "Great is the
fruit of discriminate giving;" and, being desirous to give unto the
virtuous, he determined to take counsel with the wise Vidhūra. When,
therefore, Vidhūra came to wait on him, the king bade him be seated, and
put the question to him.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

Explaining this, the Master recited half the first stanza. All the rest
are question and answer of the king and Vidhūra.

"The righteous King Yudhiṭṭhila once asked Vidhūra wise <span
id="fr_349"></span>[1](#fn_341.md):  
"Vidhūra, seek me brahmins good, in whom much wisdom lies:

"Men free from deeds of evil lust, that they may eat my food:  
So I would give, my friend, that I may reap a crop of good."

"’Tis hard to find such holy men, such brahmins, wise and good,  
Who keep them spotless from all lust, that they may eat your food.

"Of brahmins, O most mighty king, ten several kinds are there:  
Listen, while I distinguish them, and all these kinds declare.

"Some carry sacks upon their backs, root-filled and fastened tight;  
They gather healing herbs, they bathe, and magic spells recite.

"These are physician-like, O king, and brahmins too they hight:  
Such brahmins shall we seek for, now you know this kind aright?"

</div>

\[362\] Quoth King Koravya:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"These have no right to such a name: lost is their brahminhood:  
Vidhūra, find me other men who shall be wise and good,

"Men free from deeds of evil lust, that they may eat my food:  
So would I give, that I myself may reap a crop of good."

"Some carry bells and go before, and as they go they ring,  
A chariot they can drive with skill, and messages can bring:

"These are like servants, mighty king, and brahmins too they hight:  
Such brahmins shall we seek for, now you know this kind aright?"

Vidhūra, find me other men who shall be wise and good,

"Men free from deeds of evil lust, that they may eat my food:  
So would I give, that I myself may reap a crop of good."

"With waterpot and crooked staff some run to meet the king,  
Through all the towns and villages, and as they follow, sing—  
"In wood or town we never budge, until a gift you bring"!

"Like tax-men these importunate, and brahmins too they hight:  
Such brahmins shall we seek for, now you know this kind aright?"

"Some with long nails and hairy limbs, foul teeth, and matted hair,  
Covered with dust and dirt-begrimed as beggar-men they fare:

"Hewers of wood, O mighty king! and brahmins too they hight:  
Such brahmins shall we seek for, now you know this kind aright?"

"Myrobolan and vilva fruit, rose-apple, mangoes ripe <span

The labuj-fruit and planks of wood, tooth-brush and smoking-pipe,

"Sugar-cane baskets, honey sweet, and ointment too, O king,  
All these they make their traffick in, and many another thing.

"These are like merchants, O great king, and brahmins too they hight:  
Such brahmins shall we seek for, now you know this kind aright?"

"Some follow trade and husbandry, keep flocks of goats in fold,  
They give and take in marriage, and their daughters sell for gold <span
id="fr_351"></span>[2](#fn_343.md).

"Like Vessa and Ambaṭṭha <span id="fr_352"></span>[3](#fn_344.md) these;

\[364\] "Some chaplains fortunes tell, or geld and mark a beast for
pay:  
With proffered food the village folk invite them oft to stay.  
There kine and bullocks, swine and goats are slaughtered many a day.

"Some brahmins, armed with sword and shield, with battle-axe in hand,  
Ready to guide a caravan before the merchants stand.

"Others for love of gold lie down beneath the royal bed,  
At soma-sacrifice: the kings bathing above their head <span

"These are like barbers? O great king, but brahmins too they hight:

</div>

\[367\] Thus having described those who are brahmins in name only, he
went on to describe the brahmins in the highest sense in the following
two stanzas:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"But there are brahmins, too, my lord, men very wise and good,  
Free from the deeds of evil lust, to eat your offered food.

"One only meal of rice they eat: strong drink they never touch:  
And now you know this kind aright, say shall we look for such?"

</div>

When the king heard his words, he asked "Where, friend Vidhūra, where
dwell these brahmins, worthy of the best things?" "In the further
Himalaya, O king, in a cave of Mount Nanda." "Then, wise sir, bring me
those brahmins hither, by your power." Then in great joy the king
recited this stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Vidhūra, bring those brahmins here, so holy and so wise,  
Invite them, O Vidhūra, here, let no delay arise!"

</div>

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

The Great Being agreed to do as he was requested, adding this: "Now, O
king! send the drum beating about the city, to proclaim that the city
must be gloriously adorned, and all the people of it must give alms, and
undertake the holy-day vows, and pledge themselves to virtue; and you
with all your court must take the holy-day vows upon you." Himself at
early dawn, having taken his meal, and taken the holy-day vows, at
eventide he sent for a basket of the colour of jasmine, and together
with the monarch made a salutation with the full prostration <span
id="fr_354"></span>[1](#fn_346.md), \[368\] and he called to memory the
virtues of the Pacceka Buddhas, uttering these words: "Let the five
hundred Pacceka Buddhas who dwell in Northern Himalaya, in the cave of
Mount Nanda, to-morrow partake of our food!" he cast eight handfuls of
flowers into the air. At once these flowers fell upon the five hundred
Pacceka Buddhas, in the place where they dwelt. They pondered, and
understood the fact, and accepted the invitation, saying, "Reverend
Sirs, we are invited by the wise Vidhūra, and no mean creature is he: he
has the seed of a Buddha within him, and in this very cycle a Buddha he
will be. Let us show him favour." The Great Being understood that they
would comply, by token that the flowers did not return. Then he said, "O
great king! to-morrow the Pacceka Buddhas will come; do them honour and
worship." Next day the king did them great honour, preparing precious
seats for them upon a great dais. The Pacceka Buddhas, in Lake Anotatta,
having waited for the time when their bodily needs were seen to,
travelled through the air and descended in the royal courtyard. The king
and the Bodhisatta, faith in their hearts, received the bowls from their
hands, and caused them to come up on the terrace, seated them, gave them
the gift-water <span id="fr_355"></span>[2](#fn_347.md) into their hands,
and served them with food hard and soft most delightful.

After the meal, he invited them for the next day, and so on for seven
days following, presenting them with many gifts, and on the seventh day
he gave them all the requisites. Then they gave him thanks, and passing
through the air returned to the same place, and the requisites also went
with them.

The Master, after finishing this discourse, said: "No wonder, Brethren,
that the king of Kosala being my follower, has given me the gift
incomparable, for wise men of old when as yet there was no Buddha, did
the same." Then he identified the Birth: "At that time Ānanda was the
king, and the wise Vidhūra was I myself."
