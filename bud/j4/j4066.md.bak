*"There go the birds," etc.*—This story the Master told while dwelling
in the Bamboo Grove, about Elder Ānanda's renunciation of life. Then
also the Brethren were talking in the Hall of Truth about the Elder's
good qualities, when the Master came in and asked them what they sat
talking of there. He said, "This is not the first time, Brethren, that
Ānanda has renounced his life for my sake, but he did the same before."
And then he told them a story of the past.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time, there reigned in Benares a king named Bahuputtaka, or
the Father of Many Sons, and his Queen Consort was Khemā. At that time
the Great Being dwelt on Mount Cittakūṭa, and he was the chief of ninety
thousand wild geese, having come to life as a golden goose. \[424\] And
at that time, as already recounted, the queen saw a dream, and told the
king she had conceived a woman's craving to hear a Golden Goose
discourse of the Law. When the king enquired, were there any such
creatures as golden geese, he was told yes, there were on Mount
Cittakūṭa. Then he had made a lake which he called Khemā, and caused to
be planted all manner of food-corn, and daily in the four quarters made
proclamation of immunity to be cried, and sent forth a hunter to catch
geese. How this man was sent forth, and his watching of the birds, and
how news was told the king when the golden geese came, and in what
manner the snare was set and the Great Being was caught in the snare,
how Sumukha chief captain of the geese saw him not in the three
divisions of the geese, and returned, all this will be set forth in the
Mahāhaṁsa Birth <span id="fr_388"></span>[1](#fn_380.md). Now as then the
Great Being was caught in the noose and stick; and even as he hung in
the noose at the end of the stick, he stretched forth his neck looking
along the way that the geese had gone, and espying Sumukha as he came,
thought, "When he comes I will put him to the test." So when he came,
the Great Being repeated three stanzas:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"There go the birds, the ruddy geese, all overcome with fear:  
O golden-yellow Sumukha, depart! what want you here?

"My kith and kin deserted me, away they all have flown,  
Without a thought they fly away: why are you left alone?

"Fly, noble bird! with prisoners no fellowship can be:  
Sumukha, fly! nor lose the chance while you may yet be free."

</div>

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

\[425\] To which Sumukha replied, sitting on the mud—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"No, I'll not leave you, Royal Goose, when trouble draweth nigh:  
But stay I will, and by your side will either live or die."

</div>

Thus Sumukha, with a lion's note; and Dhataraṭṭha answered with this
stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"A noble heart, brave words are these, Sumukha, which you say:  
’Twas but to put you to the test I bade you fly away."

</div>

As they were thus conversing together, up comes the huntsman, staff in
hand, at the top of his speed. Sumukha encouraged Dhataraṭṭha, and flew
to meet the man, respectfully declaring the virtues of the royal bird.
Immediately the hunter's heart was softened; which Sumukha perceiving,
went back, and stood encouraging the king of the geese. And the hunter
approaching the king of the geese, recited the sixth stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"They foot it by unfooted ways, birds flying in the sky:  
And did you not, O noble Goose, afar the snare espy?"

</div>

The Great Being said:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"When life is coming to an end, and death's hour draws anigh,  
Though you may close upon it come nor trap nor snare you spy <span
id="fr_389"></span>[1](#fn_381.md)."

</div>

\[426\] The hunter, pleased with the bird's remark, then addressed three
stanzas to Sumukha.

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"There go the birds, the ruddy geese, all overcome with fear:  
And you, O golden-yellow fowl, are still left waiting here.

"They ate and drank, the ruddy geese: uncaring, they are flown;  
Away they scurry through the air, and you are left alone.

"What is this fowl, that when the rest deserting him have flown,  
Though free, you join the prisoner—why are you left alone?"

</div>

Sumukha replied:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"He is my comrade, friend, and king, dear as my life is he:  
Forsake him—no, I never will, until death calls for me."

</div>

On hearing this the hunter was much pleased, and thought within him—"If
I should harm virtuous creatures like these, the earth would gape open
and swallow me up. What care I for the king's reward? I will set them
free." And he repeated a stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Now seeing that for friendship's sake you are prepared to die,  
I set your king and comrade free, to follow where you fly."

</div>

This said, he drew down Dhataraṭṭha from the stick, and loosed the
noose, and took him to the bank, and pitifully washed the blood from
him, \[427\] and set the dislocated muscles and tendons. And by reason
of his

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

kindness of heart, and by the might of the Great Being's
Perfections <span id="fr_390"></span>[1](#fn_382.md), on the instant his
foot became whole again, and not a mark showed where he had been caught.
Sumukha beheld the Great Being with joy, and gave thanks in these words:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"With all your kindred and your friends, O hunter, happy be <span
id="fr_391"></span>[2](#fn_383.md),  
As I am happy to behold the King of birds set free."

</div>

When the hunter heard this, he said, "Now you may depart, friend." Then
the Great Being said to him, "Did you capture me for your own purposes,
my good sir, or at the bidding of another?" He told him the facts. The
other wondered whether it were better to return to Cittakūṭa, or go to
the town. "If I go to the town," he thought, "the hunter will be
rewarded, the queen's craving will be appeased, Sumukha's friendship
will be made known, then also by virtue of my wisdom I shall receive the
lake Khemā, as a free gift. It is better therefore to go to the city."
This determined, he said, "Huntsman, take us on your carrying-pole to
the king, and he shall set me free if he will."—"My lord, kings are
hard; go your ways."—"What! I have softened a hunter like thee, and
shall I not find favour with a king? Leave that to me; your part,
friend, is to convey us to him." The man did so.

When the king set eyes on the geese, he was delighted. He placed both
the geese on a golden perch, gave them honey and fried grain to eat and
sweetened water to drink, and holding his hands out in supplication
prayed them to speak of the Law. The king of the geese seeing how eager
he was to hear first addressed him in pleasant words. These are the
stanzas expressing the converse of king and goose one with another.

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now has his honor health and wealth, and is the kingdom full  
Of welfare and prosperity, and does he justly rule?"

\[428\] "O here is health and wealth, O Goose, and here's a kingdom
full  
Of welfare and prosperity, with just and righteous rule."

"Is there no blemish seen amid your court, and are your foes  
Far off; and like the shadow on the south, which never grows <span
id="fr_392"></span>[3](#fn_384.md)?"

"There is no blemish seen amid my courtiers, and my foes  
Far off are like the shadow on the south, which never grows <span
id="fr_393"></span>[3](#fn_384.md)."

"And is your queen of equal birth, obedient, sweet of speech,  
Fruitful, fair, famous, waiting on your wishes, doing each?"

"O yes, my queen's of equal birth, obedient, sweet of speech,  
Fruitful, fair, famous, waiting on my wishes, doing each."

"O fostering ruler! have you sons a many, nobly bred,  
Quickwitted, easy men to please whatever thing be sped?"

</div>

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"O Dhataraṭṭha! sons I have of fame, five score and one:  
Tell them their duty: they'll not leave your good advice undone."

</div>

On hearing this, the Great Being gave them admonition in five stanzas:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"He that puts off until too late the effort to do good,  
Though nobly bred, with virtue dowered, yet sinks beneath the flood.

\[429\] "His knowledge fades, great loss is his; as one moonblind at
night <span id="fr_394"></span>[1](j4067.htm#fn_385.md)  
Sees all things swollen twice their size with his imperfect sight.

"Who sees the truth in falsity no wisdom gains at all,  
As on a rugged mountain-path the deer will often fall.

"If any strong courageous man loves virtue, follows right,  
Though but a low-born churl, he burns like bonfires in the night.

"By using this similitude all wisdom's truths explain,  
Cherish your sons till wise they grow, like seedlings in the rain."

</div>

\[430\] Thus did the Great Being discourse to the king the livelong
night. The queen's craving was appeased. By sunrise he established him
in the virtues of kings, and exhorted him to be vigilant, then with
Sumukha flew out of the northern window and to Cittakūṭa away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After this discourse, the Master said, "Thus, Brethren, this man offered
his life for me before," and then he identified the Birth: "At that time
Channa was the huntsman, Sāriputta the king, a sister was Queen Khemā,
the Sākiya tribe was the flock of geese, Ānanda was Sumukha, and I was
the Goose King myself."
