This is a book of essays by a Zen Buddhist Abbot who visited the United
States in 1905-6, translated by another figure who was instrumental in
introducing Buddhism to the West, Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki. Originally
titled Sermons of a Buddhist Abbot, it has been reprinted in numerous
editions as Zen for Americans and is currently in print under that
title.

The book includes a translation of The Sutra of Forty-Two Chapters,
which was the first Buddhist document translated into Chinese, and which
had a huge influence on the development of Zen. Many of the essays are
introductions to various Buddhist topics for Christians, and all of them
are ideal for a general audience. The two essays which close out the
book which discuss the Buddhist attitude towards war and peace, and are
of historical interest because they were referenced by Leo Tolstoy in
his anti-war declaration.
