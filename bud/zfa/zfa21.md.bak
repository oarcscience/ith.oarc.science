### THE SACRIFICE FOR A STANZA <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md)

IN one of his many previous births on this earth, Buddha appeared as a
son of a Hindu prince. Desirous to gain spiritual insight into the
ultimate reason of existence, he retired to the solitude and quietness
of the mountains, as was customary in India, and became deeply absorbed
in meditation. He thought: "Life is misery; it is nothing but a series
of sufferings. How can I escape this everlasting torture? Unless I gain
all-knowledge and grasp eternal life and realize perfect bliss, it is of
no use to come here and live this life repeatedly. Of what worth is this
life to me, to all beings, unless we escape the curse of ignorance by
penetrating the ultimate foundation of existence? Until I gain
enlightenment and immortality, I will not move from my seat which I have
taken here under this tree, and I will bring all my spiritual powers
into activity toward that end. If I am fortunate enough to realize it, I
will not keep the spiritual

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

bliss all to myself, but will proclaim it to all sentient beings on
earth, and enlighten them, and make them happy as well."

It was midnight and silence reigned upon the earth. Buddha was deeply
enwrapt in his thoughts. Suddenly he heard a voice which came from
nowhere he knew. It did not sound like a human voice; it was clear,
penetrating, and resounding; he thought the universe was filled with a
resonant reverberation of this mysterious voice. As he listened to it he
could understand these two lines of a gâthâ:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"All component things are transient;  
The law is to be born and die."</span>

</div>

When he could make out these two lines, a spiritual illumination came
over his mind, and he felt in himself something superhuman, something
divine. His mind became so widened as to embrace the entire universe,
and he experienced a feeling of inexpressible joy. He looked across the
valley, and lo! there his gaze fell on a hideous monster straightway
confronting him. Buddha was bewildered and did not know what this all
meant.

The monster was a Yaksha, so inhuman and awe-inspiring, with the eye so
furiously glaring on Buddha, and the mouth stained with dripping blood.
It was this monstrous devil that had just recited those two lines which
had so greatly inspired him that he thought they came from a mouth other
than that of this evil genius.

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

This unexpected and altogether mysterious appearance, however, did not
at all disconcert Buddha, as he was still under the spiritual spell
induced by those two noble lines. His only thought which he had at that
moment was that the lines were not quite complete and that something was
needed to make them so. Stating only the fact of universal impermanence,
they did not show the way to escape it or to transcend it. The reason
why we mortals are groaning under the yoke of karmaic causation is that
we are yet ignorant of its true significance, that we have not yet
severed the tie of birth and death.

So said Buddha to the Yaksha: "Those lines which you have just recited
are beautiful but incomplete. Let me have the remaining two, which will
complete the gâthâ. For this is not only for my own benefit, but for the
benefit of all mankind. Pray be good enough to disclose what is yet kept
behind."

Said the monster: "I will gladly comply with your request, but at this
very moment I suffer from a bodily need and have not strength enough to
recite the remaining two lines for you. My empty stomach must be fed and
I live on human flesh. Would you first satisfy my appetite? I should
then be able to let you have what you desire."

Buddha said: "I am ready at any moment to sacrifice myself, O Yaksha,
but when I exist no more, who in this world will transmit these

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

lines all complete to posterity? The truth will then be eternally lost
to mankind. I, therefore, beseech you to recite those two remaining
lines before I die, and I will engrave the whole stanza on this rock
standing near by. After this is done, you can dispose of my body as you
please. The stanza thus left on the stone will be noticed some day by a
passer-by and brought out to the world for the enlightenment of my
fellow-beings."

The Yaksha said: "As you are so earnest and sincere, I grant your wish.
Listen to my recitation:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Transcending birth and death,  
How blissful is the Absolute!"</span>

</div>

When the Yaksha finished, Buddha made one of his fingers bleed, and with
the dripping blood inscribed the whole stanza on the rock. This being
done, Buddha threw himself over the precipice in order to fulfill his
promise. But behold! at this crisis the hideous vampire suddenly changed
his features, he became Sakrendra, a reigning god of the heavens and a
most powerful guardian angel of Buddhism. Buddha, falling into the
abyss, was miraculously received in the arms of this god, who now
honored and revered him. The heavens showered flowers and the universe
resounded with divine music.

Sutra* (Nanjo's Catalogue, No. 1113). This story was told to explain the
miraculous origin of the famous stanza beginning with "Anicca vata
sankhâra." See the sermon "The Phenomenal and the Supra-phenomenal."
