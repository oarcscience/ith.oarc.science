# THE SUTRA OF FORTY-TWO CHAPTERS <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

HAVING attained Buddhahood, the World-honored One thought thus: "To be
free from the passions and to be calm, this is the most excellent Way."

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

He was absorbed in Great Meditation, <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md)
subdued all evil ones, and in Deer Park <span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md) caused to revolve the Wheel of Dharma, which
was the Fourfold Truth, <span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#fn_3.md) and converted
the five Bhikshus, <span id="fr_4"></span>[4](#fn_4.md) Kaudinya, etc.,
inducing them to attain Enlightenment. <span id="fr_5"></span>[5](#fn_5.md)

Again, there were other Bhikshus who implored the Buddha to remove their
doubts which they had concerning his doctrine. The World-honored One
illumined all their minds through his authoritative teachings. The
Bhikshus,

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

joining their hands and reverentially bowing, followed his august
instructions.

\(1\) The Buddha said: "Those who leave their parents, go out of the
home, understand the mind, reach the source, and comprehend the
immaterial, are called Çramana. <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md)

"Those who observe the two hundred and fifty precepts <span
id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7.md) of morality, who are pure and spotless in
their behavior, and who exert themselves for the attainment of the four
fruits of saintship, <span id="fr_8"></span>[3](#fn_8.md) are called
Arhats.

"The Arhat is able to fly through space and assume different forms; his
life is eternal, and there are times when he causes heaven and earth to
quake. <span id="fr_9"></span>[4](#fn_9.md)

"Next is the Anâgâmin. <span id="fr_10"></span>[5](#fn_10.md) At the end of
his life, the spirit of the Anâgâmin ascends to the nineteenth heaven
and obtains Arhatship.

"Next is the Skridâgâmin. <span id="fr_11"></span>[6](#fn_11.md) The
Skridâgâmin

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

ascends to the heavens \[after his death\], comes back to the earth once
more, and then attains Arhatship.

"Next is the Srotaâpanna. <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md) The
Srotaâpanna dies seven times and is born seven times, when he finally
attains Arhatship.

"By the severance of the passions is meant that like the limbs severed
they are never again made use of."

\(2\) The Buddha said: "The homeless Çramana cuts off the passions,
frees himself of attachments, understands the source of his own mind,
penetrates the deepest doctrine of Buddha, and comprehends the Dharma
which is immaterial. He has no prejudice in his heart, he has nothing to
hanker after. He is not hampered by the thought of the Way, nor is he
entangled in karma. No prejudice, no compulsion, no discipline, no
enlightenment, and no going up through the grades, and yet in possession
of all honors in itself,--this is called the Way."

\(3\) The Buddha said: "Those who shaving their heads and faces become
Çramanas and who receive instruction in the Way, should surrender all
worldly possessions and be contented with whatever they obtain by
begging. <span id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md) One meal a day and one
lodging under a tree, and neither should be repeated. For what makes one
stupid and irrational is attachments and the passions.

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

\(4\) The Buddha said: "There are ten things considered good by all
beings, and ten things evil. What are they? Three of them depend upon
the body, four upon the mouth, and three upon thought.

"Three evil deeds depending upon the body are: killing, stealing, and
committing adultery. The four depending upon the mouth are: slandering,
cursing, lying, and flattery. The three depending upon thought are:
envy, anger, and infatuation. All these things are against the Holy Way,
and therefore they are evil.

"When these evils are not done, there are ten good deeds."

\(5\) The Buddha said: "If a man who has committed many a misdemeanor
does not repent and cleanse his heart of the evil, retribution will come
upon his person as sure as the streams run into the ocean which becomes
ever deeper and wider.

"If a man who has committed a misdemeanor come to the knowledge of it,
reform himself, and practise goodness, the force of retribution will
gradually exhaust itself as a disease gradually loses its baneful
influence when the patient perspires."

\(6\) The Buddha said: "When an evil-doer, seeing you practise goodness,
comes and maliciously insults you, you should patiently endure it and
not feel angry with him, for the evil-doer is insulting himself by
trying to insult you."

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

\(7\) The Buddha said: "Once a man came unto me and denounced me on
account of my observing the Way and practising great lovingkindness. But
I kept silent and did not answer him. The denunciation ceased. I then
asked him, If you bring a present to your neighbor and he accepts it
not, does the present come back to you?' The man replied, 'It will.' I
said, 'You denounce me now, but as I accept it not, you must take the
wrong deed back on your own person. It is like echo succeeding sound, it
is like shadow following object; you never escape the effect of your own
evil deeds. Be therefore mindful, and cease from doing evil.'"

\(8\) The Buddha said: "Evil-doers who denounce the wise resemble a
person who spits against the sky; the spittle will never reach the sky,
but comes down on himself. Evil-doers again resemble a man who stirs the
dust against the wind; the dust is never raised without doing him
injury. Thus, the wise will never be hurt, but the curse is sure to
destroy the evil-doers themselves."

\(9\) The Buddha said: "If you endeavor to embrace the Way through much
learning, the Way will not be understood. If you observe the Way with
simplicity of heart, great indeed is this Way."

\(10\) The Buddha said: "Those who rejoice in seeing others observe the
Way will obtain great blessing." A Çramana asked the Buddha,

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Would this
blessing ever be destroyed?" The Buddha said, "It is like a lighted
torch whose flame can be distributed to ever so many other torches which
people may bring along; and therewith they will cook food and dispel
darkness, while the original torch itself remains burning ever the same
It is even so with the bliss of the Way."

\(11\) The Buddha said: "It is better to feed one good man than to feed
one hundred bad men. It is better to feed one who observes the five
precepts of Buddha than to feed one thousand good men. It is better to
feed one Srotaâpanna than to feed ten thousands of those who observe the
five precepts of Buddha. It is better to feed one Skridâgâmin than to
feed one million of Srotaâpannas. It is better to feed one Anâgâmin than
to feed ten millions of Skridâgâmins. It is better to feed one Arhat
than to feed one hundred millions of Anâgâmins. It is better to feed one
Pratyekabuddha than to feed one billion of Arhats. It is better to feed
one of the Buddhas, either of the present, or of the past, or of the
future, than to feed ten billions of Pratyekabuddhas. It is better to
feed one who is above knowledge, onesidedness, discipline, and
enlightenment than to feed one hundred billions of Buddhas of the past,
present, or future." <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md)

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

\(12\) The Buddha said: "There are twenty difficult things to attain
\[or to accomplish\] in this world: (1) It is difficult for the poor to
practise charity; (2) It is difficult for the strong and rich to observe
the Way; <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15) (3.md) It is difficult to
disregard life and go to certain death; (4) It is only a favored few
that get acquainted with a Buddhist sutra; (5) It is by rare opportunity
that a person is born in the age of Buddha; (6) It is difficult to
conquer the passions, to suppress selfish desires; (7) It is difficult
not to hanker after that which is agreeable; (8) It is difficult not to
get into a passion when slighted; (9) It is difficult not to abuse one's
authority; (10) It is difficult to be even-minded and simple-hearted in
all one's dealings with others; (11) It is difficult to be thorough in
learning and exhaustive in investigation; (12) It is difficult to subdue
selfish pride; (13) It is difficult not to feel contempt toward the
unlearned; (14) It is difficult to be one in knowledge and practice;
(15) It is difficult not to express an opinion about others; <span
id="fr_16"></span>[2](#fn_16) (16.md) It is by rare opportunity that one

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

is introduced to a true spiritual teacher; (17) It is difficult to gain
an insight into the nature of being and to practise the Way; (18) It is
difficult to follow the steps of a savior; (19) It is difficult to be
always the master of oneself; (20) It is difficult to understand
thoroughly the Ways of Buddha."

03\) A monk asked the Buddha: "Under what conditions is it possible to
come to the knowledge of the past and to understand the most supreme
Way?" The Buddha said: "Those who are pure in heart and single in
purpose are able to understand the most supreme Way. It is like
polishing a mirror, which becomes bright when the dust is removed.
Remove your passions, and have no hankering, and the past will be
revealed unto you."

\(14\) A monk asked the Buddha: "What is good, and what is great?" The
Buddha answered: "Good is to practise the Way and to follow the truth.
Great is the heart that is in accord with the Way."

\(15\) A monk asked the Buddha: "What is most powerful, and what is most
illuminating?" The Buddha said: "Meekness is most powerful, for it
harbors no evil thoughts, and, moreover, it is restful and full of
strength. As it is free from evils, it is sure to be honored by
all. <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md)

"The most illuminating is a mind which is

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

thoroughly cleansed of dirt, and which, remaining pure, retains no
blemishes. From the time when there was yet no- heaven and earth till
the present day, there is nothing in the ten quarters which is not seen,
or known, or heard by such a mind, for it has gained all-knowledge, and
for that reason it is called 'illuminating."'

\(16\) The Buddha said: "Those who have passions are never able to
perceive the Way; for it is like stirring up clear water with hands;
people may come there wishing to find a reflection of their faces,
which, however, they will never see. A mind troubled and vexed with the
passions is impure, and on that account it never sees the Way. O monks,
do away with passions. When the dirt of passion is removed the Way will
manifest itself."

\(17\) The Buddha said: "Seeing the Way is like going into a dark room
with a torch; the darkness instantly departs, while the light alone
remains. When the Way is attained and the truth is seen, ignorance
vanishes and enlightenment abides forever."

\(18\) The Buddha said: "My doctrine is to think the thought that is
unthinkable, to practise the deed that is not-doing, to speak the speech
that is inexpressible, and to be trained in the discipline that is
beyond discipline. Those who understand this are near, those who are
confused are far. The Way is beyond words and expressions, is bound by
nothing earthly. Lose

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

sight of it to an inch, or miss it for a moment, and we are away from it
forevermore."

\(19\) The Buddha said: "Look up to heaven and down on earth, and they
will remind you of their impermanency. Look about the world, and it will
remind you of its impermanency. But when you gain spiritual
enlightenment, you shall then find wisdom. The knowledge thus attained
leads you anon to the Way."

\(20\) The Buddha said: "You should think of the four elements <span
id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md) of which the body is composed. Each of
them has its own name, and there is no such thing there known as ego. As
there is really no ego, it is like unto a mirage." <span
id="fr_19"></span>[2](#fn_19.md)

\(21\) The Buddha said: "Moved by their selfish desires, people seek
after fame and glory. But when they have acquired it, they are already
stricken in years. If you hanker after worldly fame and practise not the
Way, your labors are wrongfully applied and your energy is wasted. It is
like unto burning an incense stick. However much its pleasing odor be
admired, the fire that consumes is steadily burning up the stick."

\(22\) The Buddha said: "People cleave to their worldly possessions and
selfish passions so

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

blindly as to sacrifice their own lives for them. They are like a child
who tries to eat a little, honey smeared on the edge of a knife. The
amount is by no means sufficient to appease his appetite, but he runs
the risk of wounding his tongue."

\(23\) The Buddha said: "Men are tied up to their families and
possessions more helplessly than in a prison. There is an occasion for
the prisoner to be released, but householders entertain no desire to be
relieved from the ties of family. When a man's passion is aroused
nothing prevents him from ruining himself. Even into the maws of a tiger
will he jump. Those who are thus drowned in the filth of passion are
called the ignorant. Those who are able to overcome it are saintly
Arhats."

\(24\) The Buddha said: "There is nothing like lust. Lust may be said to
be the most powerful passion. Fortunately, we have but one thing which
is more powerful. If the thirst for truth were weaker than passion, how
many of us in the world would be able to follow the way of righteous?"

\(25\) The Buddha. said: "Men who are addicted to the passions are like
the torch-carrier running against the wind; his hands are sure to be
burned."

\(26\) The Lord of Heaven offered a beautiful fairy to the Buddha,
desiring to tempt him to the evil path, But the Buddha said, "Be gone.

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> What use have I
for the leather bag filled with filth which you have brought to me?"
Then, the god reverently bowed and asked the Buddha about the essence of
the Way, in which having been instructed by the Buddha, it is said, he
attained the Srotaâpanna-fruit.

(2 7) The Buddha said: "Those who are following the Way should behave
like a piece of timber which is drifting along a stream. If the log is
neither held by the banks, nor seized by men, nor obstructed by the
gods, nor kept in the whirlpool, nor itself goes to decay, I assure you
that this log will finally reach the ocean. If monks walking on the Way
are neither tempted by the passions, nor led astray by some evil
influences, but steadily pursue their course for Nirvâna, I assure you
that these monks will finally attain enlightenment."

\(28\) The Buddha said: "Rely not upon your own will. Your own will is
not trustworthy. Guard yourselves against sensualism, for it surely
leads to the path of evil. Your own will becomes trustworthy only when
you have attained Arhatship."

\(29\) The Buddha said: "O monks, you should not see women. <span
id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md) \[If you should have to see them\],
refrain from talking to them. \[If you should have to talk\], you should
reflect in a right spirit: 'I am now a homeless mendicant. In the world
of sin, I must behave myself like unto

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

the lotus flower whose purity is not defiled by the mud. Old ones I will
treat as my mother; elderly ones as elder sisters; younger ones as
younger sisters; and little ones as daughters.' And in all this you
should harbor no evil thoughts, but think of salvation."

\(30\) The Buddha said: "Those who walk in the Way should avoid
sensualism as those who carry hay would avoid coming near the fire."

\(31\) The Buddha said: "There was once a man who, being in despair over
his inability to control his passions, wished to mutilate himself. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md) The Buddha said to him: 'Better destroy
your own evil thoughts than do harm to your own person. The mind is
lord. When the lord himself is calmed the servants will of themselves be
yielding. If your mind is not cleansed of evil passions, what avails it
to mutilate yourself?"' Thereupon, the Buddha recited the gâthâ,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Passions grow from the will,  
The will grows from thought and imagination:  
When both are calmed,  
There is neither sensualism nor transmigration."</span>

</div>

The Buddha said, this gâthâ was taught before by Kâshyapabuddha.

\(32\) The Buddha said: "From the passions arise worry, and from worry
arises fear. Away with the passions, and no fear, no worry."

\(33\) The Buddha said: Those who follow

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

the Way are like unto warriors who fight single-handed with a multitude
of foes. They may all go out of the fort in full armor; but among them
are some who are faint-hearted, and some who go halfway and beat a
retreat, and some who are killed in the affray, and some who come home
victorious. O monks, if you desire to attain enlightenment, you should
steadily walk in your Way, with a resolute heart, with courage, and
should be fearless in whatever environment you may happen to be, and
destroy every evil influence that you may come across; for thus you
shall reach the goal."

\(34\) One night a monk was reciting a sutra bequeathed by
Kâshyapabuddha. His tone was so mournful, and his voice so fainting, as
if he were going out of existence. The Buddha asked the monk, "What was
your occupation before you became a homeless monk? "Said the monk, "I
was very fond of playing the guitar." The Buddha said, "How did you find
it when the strings were too loose?" Said the monk, "No sound is
possible." "How when the strings were too tight?" "They crack." "How
when they were neither too tight nor too loose?" "Every note sounds in
its proper tone." The Buddha then said to the monk, "Religious
discipline is also like unto playing the guitar. When the mind is
properly adjusted and quietly applied, the Way is attainable; but when
you are too fervently bent on it, your body grows tired; and

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

when your body is tired, your spirit becomes weary; when your spirit is
weary, your discipline will relax; and with the relaxation of discipline
there follows many an evil. Therefore, be calm and pure, and the Way
will be gained."

\(35\) The Buddha said: "When a man makes utensils out of a metal which
has been thoroughly cleansed of dross, the utensils will be excellent.
You monks, who wish to follow the Way, make your own hearts clean from
the dirt of evil passion, and your conduct will be unimpeachable."

\(36\) The Buddha said: "Even if one escapes from the evil creations, it
is one's rare fortune to be born as a human being. Even if one be born
as human, it is one's rare fortune to be born as a man and not a
woman. <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) Even if one be born a man, it
is one's rare fortune to be perfect in all the six senses. Even if he be
perfect in all the six senses, it is his rare fortune to be born in the
middle kingdom. Even if he be born in the middle kingdom, it is his rare
fortune to be born in the time of a Buddha. Even if he be born in the
time of a Buddha, it is his rare fortune to see the enlightened. Even if
he be able to see the enlightened, it is his rare fortune to have his
heart awakened in faith. Even if he have faith, it is his rare fortune
to awaken the heart of intelligence. Even if he awakens the heart of
intelligence, it is his rare fortune to

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

realize a spiritual state which is above discipline and attainment."

\(37\) The Buddha said: "O children of Buddha! You are away from me ever
so many thousand miles, but if you remember and think of my precepts,
you shall surely gain the fruit of enlightenment. You may, standing by
my side, see me alway, but if you observe not my precepts, you shall
never gain enlightenment."

\(38\) The Buddha asked a monk, "How do you measure the length of a
man's life?" The monk answered, "By days." The Buddha said, "You do not
understand the Way."

The Buddha asked another monk, "How do you measure the length of a man's
life?" The answered, "By the time that passes during a meal." The Buddha
said, "You do not understand the way."

The Buddha asked a third monk, "How do you measure the length of a man's
life?" The monk answered, "By the breath." The Buddha said, "Very well,
you know the Way."

\(39\) The Buddha said, "Those who study the doctrine of the Buddhas
will do well to believe and observe all that is taught by them. It is
like unto honey; it is sweet within, it is sweet without, it is sweet
throughout; so is the Buddhas' teaching."

\(40\) The Buddha said: "O monks, you must not walk on the Way as the ox
that is attached to the wheel. His body moves, but his heart is

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

not willing. But when your hearts are in accord with the Way, there is
no need of troubling yourselves about your outward demeanor."

\(41\) The Buddha said: "Those who practise the Way might well follow
the example of an ox that marches through the deep mire carrying a heavy
load. He is tired, but his steady gaze, looking forward, will never
relax until he come out of the mire, and it is only then that he takes a
respite. O monks, remember that passions and sins are more than the
filthy mire, and that you can escape misery only by earnestly and
steadily thinking of the Way."

\(42\) The Buddha said: "I consider the dignities of kings and lords as
a particle of dust that floats in the sunbeam. I consider the treasure
of precious metals and stones as bricks and pebbles. I consider the
gaudy dress of silks and brocades as a worn-out rag. I consider this
universe as small as the *holila* (?) fruit. I consider the lake of
Anavatapta as a drop of oil with which one smears the feet. I consider
the various methods of salvation taught by the Buddhas as a treasure
created by the imagination. I consider the transcendental doctrine of
Buddhism as precious metal or priceless fabric seen in a dream. I
consider the teaching of Buddhas as a flower before my eyes. I consider
the practice of Dhyâna as a pillar supporting the Mount Sumeru. I
consider Nirvâna as awakening from a day dream or nightmare. I consider
the struggle

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

between heterodox and orthodox as the antics of the six \[mythical\]
dragons. I consider the doctrine of sameness as the absolute ground of
reality. I consider all the religious works done for universal salvation
as like the plants in the four seasons."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[3:1](zfa03.htm#fr_0.md) This is the first Buddhist
literature ever translated into the Chinese language. It was brought
into China by the first missionaries from Central India, A. D. 67, who
were specially invited by the Emperor Ming of the Han Dynasty. Though
some authorities think that the sutra existed in Sanskrit in the present
Chinese form, the most probable fact is, as maintained by another
authority, that the translators extracted all these passages from the
different Buddhist canonical books which they brought along for their
missionary purposes, and compiled them after the fashion of the
Confucian *Analects*, beginning each chapter with the stereotyped "The
Buddha said," which corresponds to the Confucian "The Master said." This
was the most natural thing for the first Buddhist workers from India to
do in the land of Confucianism.

The sutra, besides being a collection of moral and religious sayings of
the Buddha, is interesting to us at least in the following two points:
(1) It throws some light on the development which Buddhism made in India
from the Parinirvâna of Buddha down to the times of these two
translators; and (2) it allows us to see what the first Buddhist
propagandists thought best to introduce, as the most essential <span
id="page_4">p. 4</span> doctrines of their faith, among the people who
had hitherto been educated mostly by the Confucians but partly by the
Laotzeans.

The first translators did not think it wise to present their doctrine
systematically by writing a discourse or a lengthy treatise, as they
were wont to do in their native country, nor did they think it advisable
to reproduce an entire sutra in the language of their newly adopted
country. On the other hand, they culled Buddha's short sayings and
dialogues from various sutras, imitating the general style of the
Confucian sacred book *Lun Yu*. They must have thought that Buddhism,
which has so many voluminous canonical books and deeply metaphysical
treatises, would be best promulgated in China through an anthology, and
not through an exact reproduction of the original texts. The present
sutra is undoubtedly the result of these considerations, and on this
account it must be said to be well suited for popular reading.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[5:1](zfa03.htm#fr_6.md) Or Çramanera, from the root
*çram*, "to exert oneself," "to make effort."

<span id="fn_7"></span>[5:2](zfa03.htm#fr_7.md) This is fully explained in
the Vinaya texts in the *Sacred Books of the East*, Vols. XIII, XVII,
XX.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[5:3](zfa03.htm#fr_8.md) The Arhats, the Anâgâmins,
the Skridâgâmins, the Srotâpannas. These are explained below.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[5:4](zfa03.htm#fr_9.md) This and the following
three passages seem to be a gloss, incorporated in the text later by a
copyist. Arhat, according to the traditional Chinese interpretation,
means "one who kills robbers," that is, the robbers of passion and
prejudice.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[5:5](zfa03.htm#fr_10.md) Anâgâmin means "one who
never returns." The nineteenth heaven is called Akanishtha, the highest
in the world of form (*rûpaloka*).

<span id="fn_11"></span>[5:6](zfa03.htm#fr_11.md) Skridâgâmin means "one
who comes back."

<span id="fn_12"></span>[6:1](zfa03.htm#fr_12.md) Srotaâpanna means "one
who gets in the stream."

<span id="fn_13"></span>[6:2](zfa03.htm#fr_13.md) Cf. Luke, Xii, 33 *et
seq*.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[9:1](zfa03.htm#fr_14.md) This seems to be a very
sweeping assertion on the part of the Buddha, but the principle remains
ever true. The <span id="page_10">p. 10</span> fundamental fact of the
religious life is purity of heart. If there is a dark corner in your
heart, all that you do is hypocrisy. When the Emperor Wu of Liang saw
Bodhidharma, he asked the saint, "I have built so many monasteries, I
have converted so many souls, I have copied so many sacred sutras; now
what does Your Holiness think my merit will be?" To this, Bodhidharma
made a curt response, "No merit whatever."
