### THE GOD-CONCEPTION OF BUDDHISM <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md)

AMONG the many critical opinions which are passed upon Buddhism by
Christian or Western scholars, there are two which stand out most
conspicuously and most persistently. One of them declares that Buddhism
is a religion which denies the existence of the soul, and the other that
it is atheistic or at best pantheistic, which latter term implies what
is practically tantamount to the rejection of a God, that is, a personal
God as believed in by the Christians. The object of this discourse is to
see to what extent the second criticism is, if at all, justifiable. In
other words, I propose here to elucidate the Buddhist conception of God.

At the outset, let me state that Buddhism is not atheistic as the term
is ordinarily understood. It has certainly a God, the highest reality
and truth, through which and in which this universe exists. However, the
followers of Buddhism usually avoid the term God, for it savors so much
of Christianity, whose spirit is

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

not always exactly in accord with the Buddhist interpretation of
religious experience. Again, Buddhism is not pantheistic in the sense
that it identifies the universe with God. On the other hand, the
Buddhist God is absolute and transcendent; this world, being merely its
manifestation, is necessarily fragmental and imperfect. To define more
exactly the Buddhist notion of the highest being, it may be convenient
to borrow the term very happily coined by a modern German scholar,
"panentheism," according to which God is πᾶν καὶ ἕν (all and one) and
more than the totality of existence.

One of the most fundamental beliefs of Buddhism is that all the
multitudinous and multifarious phenomena in the universe start from, and
have their being in, one reality which itself has "no fixed abode,"
being above spatial and temporal limitations. However different and
separate and irreducible things may appear to the senses, the most
profound law of the human mind declares that they are all one in their
hidden nature. In this world of relativity, or *nânâtva* as Buddhists
call it, subject and object, thought and nature, are separate and
distinct, and as far as our sense-experience goes, there is an
impassable chasm between the two which no amount of philosophizing can
bridge. But the very constitution of the mind demands a unifying
principle which is an indispensable hypothesis for our conception of
phenomenality; and this

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

hypothesis is called "the gate of sameness," *samatâ*, in
contradistinction to "the gate of difference," nânâtva; and Buddhism
declares that no philosophy or religion is satisfactory which does not
recognize these two gates. In some measure the "gate of sameness" may be
considered to correspond to "God" and the "gate of difference" to the
world of individual existence.

Now, the question is, "How does Buddhism conceive the relation between
these two entrances to the abode of Supreme Knowledge (*sambodhi*)?" And
the answer to this decides the Buddhist attitude towards pantheism,
theism, atheism, and what not.

To state it more comprehensively, Buddhism recognizes the coexistence
and identity of the two principles, sameness and difference. Things are
many and yet one; they are one and yet many. I am not thou, and thou art
not I; and yet we are all one in essence. When one slays another, there
is an actor, an act, and a sufferer, all distinct and separate; and yet

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If the red slayer think he slays,  
   Or if the slain think he is slain,  
They know not well the subtle ways  
   I keep, and pass, and turn again."</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Buddhism,
therefore, says that while we have to acknowledge the world of
particulars in which individuality predominates, we must not forget that
looking through the gate of sameness all

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

distinctions and contradictions vanish in a higher principle of unity. A
Japanese poet thus sings:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Rain and hail and ice and snow,  
Neither like the other. So!  
When they melt, however, lo,  
See one stream of water flow!</span>

</div>

Intellectually, the coexistence of the two mutually excluding thoughts
is impossible, for the proposition, "Mine are not thine," cannot be made
at the same time the proposition, "Mine are thine." But here Buddhism is
speaking of our inmost religious experience, which deals directly with
facts and not with their more or less distorted intellectual
reflections. It is, therefore, really idle to say that Buddhism is
pantheistic or atheistic or nihilistic. Buddhism is not a philosophical
system, though it is the most rational and intellectual religion in the
world. What it proposes is to make clear facts of the deepest spiritual
life and to formulate a doctrine which leads its followers to the path
of inward experience.

Thus, according to the proclamation of an enlightened mind, God or the
principle of sameness is not transcendent, but immanent in the universe,
and we sentient beings are manifesting the divine glory just as much as
the lilies of the field. A God who, keeping aloof from his creations,
sends down his words of command through specially favored personages, is
rejected by Buddhists as against the constitution of human

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

reason. God must be in us, who are made in his likeness. We cannot
presume the duality of God and the world. Religion is not to go to God
by forsaking the world, but to find him in it. Our faith is to believe
in our essential oneness with him, and not in our sensual separateness.
"God in us and we in him," must be made the most fundamental faith of
all religion.

We must not, however, suppose that God is no more than the sum-total of
individual existences. God exists even when all creations have been
destroyed and reduced to a state of chaotic barrenness. God exists
eternally, and he will create another universe out of the ruins of this
one. To our limited intelligence there may be a beginning and an end of
the worlds, but as God surveys them, being and becoming are one selfsame
process. To him nothing changes, or, to state it rather paradoxically,
he sees no change whatever in all the changes we have around us; all
things are absolutely quiet in their eternal cycle of birth and death,
growth and decay, combination and disintegration. This universe cannot
exist outside of God, but God is more than the totality of individual
existences; God is here as well as there, God is not only this but also
that. As far as he is manifested in nature and mind, they glorify him,
and we can have a glimpse of his image and feel, however imperfectly,
his inner life. But it will be a grievous error,

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

let us repeat, to think that he has exhausted his being in the
manifestation of this universe, that he is absolutely identical with his
creations, and that with the annihilation of the world he vanishes into
eternal emptiness.

There is a favorite saying in Buddhism which declares that "sameness
without difference is sameness wrongly conceived, while difference
without sameness is difference wrongly conceived"; to express this in
Christian terms, "God not in the world is a false God, and the world not
in God is unreality." All things return to one, and one operates in all
things; many in one and one in many; this is the Buddhist conception of
God and the world. Billows and waves and ripples, all surging, swelling,
and ebbing, and yet are they not so many different motions of the
eternally selfsame body of water? The moon is serenely shining up in the
sky, and she is alone in all the heavens and on the entire earth; but
when she mirrors herself in the brilliant whiteness of the evening dews
which appear like glittering pearls broadcast upon the earth from the
hand of a fairy,--how wondrously numerous her images! And is not every
one of them complete in its own fashion? This is the way in which an
enlightened mind contemplates God and the world.

God is immanent in the world and not outside of it; therefore, when we
comprehend the secret of the "little flower in the crannied wall," we

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

know the reason of this universe. Reason is the inner life of all
beings, it is the subjectivity of existence, it is the quickening spirit
of all creation, it is a realization in our finite minds of infinite
divinity. When we know ourselves, we know heaven and earth, we know God,
we know everything and anything. We know his presence even in the most
insignificant flower in the field which is trampled under foot by men
and beasts carelessly and pitilessly, to say nothing about the starry
heavens with their grandeur which is replete with suggestions, or about
the huge mass of inert matter on which mountains rise, oceans roar, and
sentient beings walk. When we come to realize this mysterious presence
of the highest reason in all things, we are struck with the fact and
there arise mingled feelings of awe, admiration, and helplessness, which
latter is strangely tinged with a sense of self-exaltation. We are
awe-stricken because it is beyond our human intelligence to grasp
thoroughly the scheme of God. We admire it because of the wonderful
beauty and harmony which are traceable in every step of his, though our
imperfect minds are sometimes set against almost insurmountable
difficulties in the reconciliation of contraries and opposites. We feel
helpless because our fragmentary consciousness is unable to review the
entire range of divine operation and thus to know the why of all these
things, though the recognition of divinity in us lifts us above the
wearisome condemnation

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

piled upon humanity by some moralists and religionists.

\*      \*      \*

Having thus expounded the Buddhist conception of God and his relation to
us, I wish to proceed to explain some terms which. are generally used by
Buddhists to designate the highest being in its various modes and
phases.

As I mentioned before, Buddhists do not make use of the term God, which
characteristically belongs to Christian terminology. An equivalent most
commonly used is Dharmakâya, which word has been explained in one of the
sermons herein collected, and it will not be necessary to enter again
upon the discussion of its signification. Let us only see what other
equivalents have been adopted.

When the Dharmakâya is most concretely conceived it becomes the Buddha,
or Tathâgata, or Vairochana, or Amitâbha. Buddha means "the
enlightened," and this may be understood to correspond to "God is
wisdom." Vairochana is "coming from the sun," and Amitâbha, "infinite
light," which reminds us of the Christian notion, "God is light." As to
the correct meaning of Tathâgata, Buddhists do not give any definite and
satisfactory explanation, and it is usually considered to be the
combination of *tathâ* = "thus" and *gata* = "gone," but it is difficult
to find out how "Thus Gone" came to be an appellation of the supreme
being. There are,

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

some scholars, however, who understand *gata* in the sense of "being in"
or "situated in." If this be correct, Tathâgata meaning "being thus," or
"being such," can be interpreted in the same sense as Tathâtâ or
Bhûtatathâtâ or Tattva, as explained below. But in this case Tathâgata
will lose its personification and become a metaphysical term like the
others, though it has been so persistently used by Buddhists in
connection with the historical Buddha that it always awakens in their
minds something more concrete and personal than a mere ontological
abstraction.

Buddhism is the most speculative of all the existing religions in the
world and abounds with many highly abstract terms which may sound empty
to ordinary minds. Among them we have such words as Tathâtâ (or
Tathâtva), Tattva, Bhûtatathâtâ, Bhûtakoti, Çûnyatâ, Alakshitam,
Nirvâna, etc. These are all philosophical terms for Dharmakâya. To
explain: Tathâtâ or tathâtva or tattva is "suchness," or "being such,"
and Buddhist scholars assert that, strictly speaking, these terms alone
rightly designate the nature of the highest reality. When we speak of
its absolute transcendentality, people are liable to take it for an
empty nothing; while if we state that it is eternally true and real,
they may consider it something concrete and particular. To avoid both
extremes, or rather to synthesize them, the term "Suchness" has been
coined; but in reality all human efforts are altogether

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

insufficient to express the true nature of the Ultimate. Says
Açvaghosha, "The Immortal Essence is absolutely beyond intellectual
demonstrability, but we as rational beings need some words to express
ourselves, and for that purpose the term 'suchness' has been selected,
disposing of all others." The words in which Goethe makes Faust utter
his feeling concerning God may here be quoted also as corroborating
Açvaghosha's conception of Suchness:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Who dare express Him?  
And who profess Him,  
Saying: I believe in Him!  
Who, feeling, seeing,  
Deny this being,  
Saying: I believe Him not!  
The All-enfolding,  
The All-upholding,  
Folds and upholds He not  
Thee, me, Himself?  
\*      \*      \*  
\*      \*      \*  
Vast as it is, fill with that force thy heart,  
And when thou in the feeling wholly blessed art,  
Call it, then, what thou wilt,--  
Call it Bliss! Heart! Love! God!  
I have no name to give it!  
Feeling is all in all:  
The name is sound and smoke,  
Obscuring Heaven's clear glow."</span>

</div>

When even this Tathâtva is found inadequate for certain purposes,
Buddhists add *Bhûta* = reality thereto and coin the word Bhûtatathâtâ,
which means "that which really exists as such." Suchness, being an
abstract term, may breed

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

some misconception, when the term is used alone, on the part of the
uninitiated. To avoid this, "reality" has been prefixed, which purposes
to make it clear that the ultimate reason is not an abstraction, not a
mere subjective creation, but a real objective (or rather
transcendental) existence. Bhûtakoti serves the same end, as it means
the "highest point of reality," or "the real end of things."

Alakshitam, Çûnyatâ, and Nirvânam express the negative phase of the
Dharmakâya. When affirmation alone is not sufficient, we frequently
resort to the negative way of defining things, showing thereby at least
what they are not. The human mind cannot have a positively adequate
conception of things which are beyond the realm of conditionality, for
it is bound up within spatial and temporal relations; and in order to
give expression to these non-conditional objects, we use the negative
method and say that they are not such and such. In innumerable ways,
this negation is as effective in defining things as affirmation.

When Buddhists assert that the Dharmakâya is çûnya = empty, or
alakshana, = devoid of particular marks, or nirvâna = emancipating, or
nâçrava = faultless, they are following the inevitable course of
mentation. All these and some other negative terms unfortunately have
caused a great deal of misunderstanding on the part of unsympathetic
critics who have either forgotten

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

or ignored the peculiar proclivity of human reason to onesidedness and
exclusiveness.

Lastly, Paramârtha and Satya are the terms used to designate the
epistemological phase of the Dharmakâya. Paramârtha is the first or
highest reason, and Satya is truth or that which truly is. And for the
psychological aspect of the Dharmakâya, or as it is manifested in the
human consciousness, we have Bodhi or Hridaya. Bodhi is the divine
wisdom incarnated in our limited intelligence, or the divine love as
reflected in our human sympathy and compassion. Hridaya is the inner
life of existence which prompts and quickens us to do the will of the
Dharmakâya, and which is awakened to its full dignity and glory when
intelligence passes over the limits of relativity. The reason why we are
able to have an insight into the nature of the ultimate being and to
recognize the truth that sameness and difference are co-existent and
really identical, is because our Bodhi or Hridaya is essentially one
with the Dharmakâya. When the Bodhi comes to know itself, it also knows
the inner being of Dharmakâya, however fragmentary the knowledge be, and
we lie blissfully at rest in the bosom of eternal motherliness.
