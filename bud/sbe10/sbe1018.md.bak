## CHAPTER XVI.

PLEASURE.

   209. He who gives himself to vanity, and does not give himself to
meditation, forgetting the real aim (of life) and grasping at pleasure,
will in time envy him who has exerted himself in meditation.

   210. Let no man ever look for what is pleasant, or what is
unpleasant. Not to see what is pleasant is pain, and it is pain to see
what is unpleasant.

   211. Let, therefore, no man love anything; loss of the beloved is
evil. Those who love nothing and hate nothing, have no fetters.

   212. From pleasure comes grief, from pleasure comes fear; he who is
free from pleasure knows neither grief nor fear.

   213. From affection comes grief, from affection comes fear; he who is
free from affection knows neither grief nor fear.

   214. From lust comes grief, from lust comes fear; he who is free from
lust knows neither grief nor fear.

   215. From love comes grief, from love comes fear; he who is free from
love knows neither grief nor fear.

   216. From greed comes grief, from greed comes fear; he who is free
from greed knows neither grief nor fear.

   217. He who possesses virtue and intelligence,

\[214. See Beal, Catena, p. 200.\]

p\. 57

who is just, speaks the truth, and does what is his own business, him
the world will hold dear.

   218. He in whom a desire for the Ineffable (Nirvâ*n*a) has sprung up,
who is satisfied in his mind, and whose thoughts are not bewildered by
love, he is called ûrdhva*m*srotas (carried upwards by the stream).

   219. Kinsmen, friends, and lovers salute a man who has been long
away, and returns safe from afar.

   220. In like manner his good works receive him who has done good, and
has gone from this world to the other;--as kinsmen receive a friend on
his return.

\[218. Ûrdhva*m*srotas or uddha*m*soto is the technical name for one who
has reached the world of the Av*ri*has (Aviha), and is proceeding to
that of the Akanish*th*as (Akani*tth*a). This is the last stage before
he reaches the formless world, the Arûpadhâtu. (See Buddhaghosha's
Parables, p. 123; Burnouf, Introduction, p. 599.) Originally
ûrdhva*m*srotas may have been used in a less technical sense, meaning
one who swims against the stream, and is not carried away by the vulgar
passions of the world.\]
