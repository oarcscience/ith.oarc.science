# IV. A*TTH*AKAVAGGA.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. KÂMASUTTA.

> Sensual pleasures are to be avoided.

   1. If he who desires sensual pleasures is successful, he certainly
becomes glad-minded, having obtained what a mortal wishes for. (766)

   2. But if those sensual pleasures fail the person who desires and
wishes (for them), he will suffer, pierced by the arrow (of pain). (767)

   3. He who avoids sensual pleasures as (he would avoid treading upon)
the head of a snake with his foot, such a one, being thoughtful (sato),
will conquer this desire. (768)

   4. He who covets extensively (such) pleasures (as these), fields,
goods, or gold, cows and horses, servants, women, relations, (769)

   5. Sins will overpower him, dangers will crush him, and pain will
follow him as water (pours into) a broken ship. (770)

   6. Therefore let one always be thoughtful, and avoid pleasures;
having abandoned them, let him cross the stream, after baling out the
ship, and go to the other shore. (771)

Kâmasutta is ended.

p. 147

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. GUHA*TTH*AKASUTTA.

> Let no one cling to existence and sensual pleasures.

   1. A man that lives adhering to the cave (i.e. the body), who is
covered with much (sin), and sunk into delusion, such a one is far from
seclusion, for the sensual pleasures in the world are not easy to
abandon. (772)

   2. Those whose wishes are their motives, those who are linked to the
pleasures of the world, they are difficult to liberate, for they cannot
be liberated by others, looking for what is after or what is before,
coveting these and former sensual pleasures. (773)

   3. Those who are greedy of, given to, and infatuated by sensual
pleasures, those who are niggardly, they, having entered upon what is
wicked, wail when they are subjected to pain, saying: 'What will become
of us, when we die away from here?' (774)

   4. Therefore let a man here<sup>\[1\]</sup> learn, whatever he knows
as wicked in the world, let him not for the sake of that (?) practise
(what is) wicked<sup>\[2\]</sup>; for short is this life, say the wise.
(775)

   5. I see in the world this trembling race given to desire for
existences; they are wretched men who lament in the mouth of death, not
being free from the desire for reiterated existences. (776)

   6. Look upon those men trembling in selfishness, like fish in a
stream nearly dried up, with little water; seeing this, let one wander
about unselfish, without forming any attachment to existences. (777)

\[1. Idheva = imasmi*m* yeva sâsane. Commentator.

2\. Na tassa hetu visama*m* *k*areyya.\]

p. 148

   7. Having subdued his wish for both ends<sup>\[1\]</sup>, having
fully understood touch without being greedy, not doing what he has
himself blamed, the wise (man) does not cling to what is seen and
heard<sup>\[2\]</sup>. (778)

   8. Having understood name<sup>\[3\]</sup>, let the Muni cross over
the stream, not defiled by any grasping; having pulled out the arrow (of
passion), wandering about strenuous, he does not wish for this world or
the other. (779)

Guha*tth*akasutta is ended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. DU*TTH*A*TTH*AKASUTTA.

> The Muni undergoes no censure, for he has shaken off all systems of
> philosophy, and is therefore independent.

   1. Verily, some wicked-minded people censure, and also just-minded
people censure, but the Muni does not undergo the censure that has
arisen; therefore there is not a discontented (khila) Muni anywhere.
(780)

   2. How can he who is led by his wishes and possessed by his
inclinations overcome his own (false) view? Doing his own doings let him
talk according to his understanding<sup>\[4\]</sup>. (781)

   3. The person who, without being asked, praises

p. 149

his own virtue and (holy) works to others, him the good call ignoble,
one who praises himself<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (782)

   4. But the Bhikkhu who is calm and of a happy mind, thus not praising
himself for his virtues, him the good call noble, one for whom there are
no desires anywhere in the world<sup>\[2\]</sup>. (783)

   5. He whose Dhammas are (arbitrarily) formed and fabricated, placed
in front, and confused, because he sees in himself a good result, is
therefore given to (the view which is called)
kuppa-pa*t*i*kk*a-santi<sup>\[3\]</sup>. (?) (784)

   6. For the dogmas of philosophy are not easy to overcome, amongst the
Dhammas (now this and now that) is adopted after consideration;
therefore a man rejects and adopts (now this and now that) Dhamma
amongst the dogmas<sup>\[4\]</sup>. (785)

   7. For him who has shaken off (sin) there is nowhere in the world any
prejudiced view of the different existences; he who has shaken off
(sin), after leaving deceit and arrogance behind, which (way) should he
go, he (is) independent<sup>\[6\]</sup>. (786)

p. 150

   8. But he who is dependent undergoes censure amongst the Dhammas;
with what (name) and how should one name him who is independent? For by
him there is nothing grasped or rejected, he has in this world shaken
off every (philosophical) view<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (787)

Du*tth*a*tth*akasutta is ended.

## 4. SUDDHA*TTH*AKASUTTA.

> No one is purified by philosophy, those devoted to philosophy run from
> one teacher to another, but the wise are not led by passion, and do
> not embrace anything in the world as the highest.

   1. I see a pure, most excellent, sound man, by his views a man's
purification takes place, holding this opinion, and having seen this
view to be the highest he goes back to knowledge, thinking to see what
is pure<sup>\[2\]</sup>. (788)

   2. If a man's purification takes place by (his philosophical) views,
or he by knowledge leaves pain behind, then he is purified by another
(way than the ariyamagga, i.e. the noble way), together with his
upadhis, on account of his views he tells him to say so<sup>\[3\]</sup>.
(789)

\[1. Upayo<sup>\[\*\]</sup> hi dhammesu upeti vâda*m*

p. 151

   3. But the Brâhma*n*a who does not cling to what has been seen, or
heard, to virtue and (holy) works, or to what has been thought, to what
is good and to what is evil, and who leaves behind what has been
grasped, without doing anything in this world, he does not acknowledge
that purification cornes from another<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (790)

   4. Having left (their) former (teacher) they go to another, following
their desires they do not break asunder their ties; they grasp, they let
go like a monkey letting go the branch (just) after having caught (hold
of it). (791)

   5. Having himself undertaken some (holy) works he goes to various
(things) led by his senses, but a man of great understanding, a wise man
who by his wisdom has understood the Dhamma, does not go to various
(occupations). (792)

   6. He being secluded amongst all the Dhammas, whatever has been seen,
heard, or thought--how should any one in this world be able to alter
him, the seeing one, who wanders openly<sup>\[2\]</sup>? (793)

   7. They do not form (any view), they do not prefer (anything), they
do not say, 'I am infinitely pure;' having cut the tied knot of
attachment, they do not long for (anything) anywhere in the world. (794)

\[1.Na brâhma*n*o a*ññ*ato suddhim âha  
     Di*tth*e sute sîlavate mute vâ

p. 152

   8. He is a Brâhma*n*a that has conquered (sin)<sup>\[1\]</sup>; by
him there is nothing embraced after knowing and seeing it; he is not
affected by any kind of passion; there is nothing grasped by him as the
highest in this world. (795)

Suddha*tth*akasutta is ended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. PARAMA*TTH*AKASUTTA.

> One should not give oneself to philosophical disputations; a
> Brâhma*n*a who does not adopt any system of philosophy, is
> unchangeable, has reached Nibbâna.

   1. What one person, abiding by the (philosophical) views, saying,
'This is the most excellent,' considers the highest in the world,
everything different from that he says is wretched, therefore he has not
overcome dispute<sup>\[2\]</sup>. (796)

   2. Because he sees in himself a good result, with regard to what has
been seen (or) heard, virtue and (holy) works, or what has been thought,
therefore, having embraced that, he looks upon everything else as
bad<sup>\[3\]</sup>. (797)

   3. The expert call just that a tie dependent

\[1. *K*atunna*m* kilesasîmâna*m* atîtattâ  
     Sîmâtigo bâhitapâpattâ *k*a brâhma*n*o.

Properly, 'others (are) wretched.'

     Tad eva so tattha samuggahâya

p. 153

upon which one looks upon anything else as bad. Therefore let a Bhikkhu
not depend upon what is seen, heard, or thought, or upon virtue and
(holy) works<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (798)

   4. Let him not form any (philosophical) view in this world, either by
knowledge or by virtue and (holy) works, let him not represent himself
equal (to others), nor think himself either low or distinguished. (799)

   5. Having left what has been grasped, not seizing upon anything he
does not depend even on knowledge. He does not associate with those that
are taken up by different things, he does not return to any
(philosophical) view<sup>\[2\]</sup>. (800)

   6. For whom there is here no desire for both ends, for reiterated
existence either here or in another world, for him there are no
resting-places (of the mind) embraced after investigation amongst the
doctrines (dhammesu)<sup>\[3\]</sup>. (801)

   7. ln him there is not the least prejudiced idea with regard to what
has been seen, heard, or thought; how could any one in this world alter
such a Brâhma*n*a who does not adopt any view? (802)

\[1. Ta*m* vâpi gantha*m* kusalâ vadanti

p. 154

   8. They do not form (any view), they do not prefer (anything), the
Dhammas are not chosen by them, a Brâhma*n*a is not dependent upon
virtue and (holy) works; having gone to the other shore, such a one does
not return. (803)

Parama*tth*akasutta is ended.

## 6. *G*ARÂSUTTA.

> From selfishness come grief and avarice; The Bhikkhu who has turned
> away frorn the world and wanders about houseless, is independent, and
> does not wish for purification through another.

   1. Short indeed is this life, within a hundred years one dies, and if
any one lives longer, then he dies of old age. (804)

   2. People grieve from selfishness, perpetual cares kill them, this
(world) is full of disappointment; seeing this, let one not live in a
house. (805)

   3. That even of which a man thinks 'this is mine' is left behind by
death: knowing this, let not the wise (man) turn himself to worldliness
(while being my) follower<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (806)

   4. As a man awakened does not see what he has met with in his sleep,
so also he does not see the beloved person that has passed away and is
dead. (807)

   5. Both seen and heard are the persons whose particular name is
mentioned, but only the name

\[1. Mara*n*ena pi ta*m* pahîyati  
     Ya*m* puriso mama-y-idan ti ma*ññ*ati,  
     Evam pi viditvâ pa*nd*ito  
     Na pamattâya nametha mâmako.\]

p. 155

remains undecayed of the person that has passed away<sup>\[1\]</sup>.
(808)

   6. The greedy in their selfishness do not leave sorrow, lamentation,
and avarice; therefore the Munis leaving greediness wandered about
seeing security (i.e. Nibbâna). (809)

   7. For a Bhikkhu, who wanders about unattached and cultivates the
mind of a recluse, they say it is proper that he does not show himself
(again) in existence<sup>\[2\]</sup>. (810)

   8. Under all circumstances the independent Muni does not please nor
displease (any one); sorrow and avarice do not stick to him (as little)
as water to a leaf. (811)

   9. As a drop of water does not stick to a lotus, as water does not
stick to a lotus, so a Muni does not cling to anything, namely, to what
is seen or heard or thought<sup>\[3\]</sup>. (812)

   10. He who has shaken off (sin) does not therefore think (much of
anything) because it has been seen or heard or thought; he does not wish
for

\[1. Di*tth*âpi sutâpi te *g*anâ

## 7. TISSAMETTEYYASUTTA.

> Sexual intercourse should be avoided.

   1. 'Tell me, O venerable one,'--so said the venerable Tissa
Metteyya,--'the defeat of him who is given to sexual intercourse;
hearing thy precepts we will learn in seclusion.' (814)

   2. 'The precepts of him who is given to sexual intercourse, O
Metteyya,'--so said Bhagavat,--'are lost, and he employs himself
wrongly, this is what is ignoble in him. (815)

   3. 'He who, having formerly wandered alone, gives himself up to
sexual intercourse, him they call in the world a low, common fellow,
like a rolling chariot. (816)

   4. 'What honour and renown he had before, that is lost for him;
having seen this let him learn to give up sexual intercourse. (817)

   5. 'He who overcome by his thoughts meditates like a miser, such a
one, having heard the (blaming) voice of others, becomes discontented.
(818)

   6. 'Then he makes weapons (i.e. commits evil

into falsehood<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (819)

   7. 'Designated "wise" he has entered upon a solitary life, then
having given himself up to sexual intercourse, he (being) a fool suffers
pain. (820)

   8. 'Looking upon this as misery let the Muni from first to last in
the world firmly keep to his solitary life, let him not give himself up
to sexual intercourse. (821)

   9. 'Let him learn seclusion, this is the highest for noble men, but
let him not therefore think himself the best, although he is verily near
Nibbâna. (822)

   10. 'The Muni who wanders void (of desire), not coveting sensual
pleasures, and who has crossed the stream, him the creatures that are
tied in sensual pleasures envy.' (823)

Tissametteyyasutta is ended.

## 8. PASÛRASUTTA.

> Disputants brand each other as fools, they wish for praise, but being
> repulsed they become discontented; one is not purified by dispute, but
> by keeping to Buddha, who has shaken off all sin.

   1. Here they maintain 'purity,' in other doctrines (dhamma) they do
not allow purity; what they have devoted themselves to, that they call
good, and they enter extensively upon the single truths<sup>\[2\]</sup>.
(824)

p. 158

   2. Those wishing for dispute, having plunged into the assembly, brand
each other as fools mutually, they go to others and pick a quarrel,
wishing for praise and calling themselves (the only) expert. (825)

   3. Engaged in dispute in the middle of the assembly, wishing for
praise he lays about on all sides; but when his dispute has been
repulsed he becomes discontented, at the blame he gets angry he who
sought for the faults (of others). (826)

   4. Because those who have tested his questions say that his dispute
is lost and repulsed, he laments and grieves having lost his disputes;
'he has conquered me,' so saying he wails. (827)

   5. These disputes have arisen amongst the Sama*n*as, in these
(disputes) there is (dealt) blow (and) stroke; having seen this, let him
leave off disputing, for there is no other advantage in trying to get
praise. (828)

   6. Or he is praised there, having cleared up the dispute in the
middle of the assembly; therefore he will laugh and be elated, having
won that case as he had a mind to. (829)

   7. That which is his exaltation will also be the field of his defeat,
still he talks proudly and arrogantly; seeing this, let no one dispute,
for the expert do not say that purification (takes place) by
that<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (830)

   8. As a hero nourished by kingly food goes about roaring, wishing for
an adversary--where he (i.e. the philosopher, Di*tth*igatika) is, go
thou there, O

against<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (831)

   9. Those who, having embraced a (certain philosophical) view, dispute
and maintain 'this only (is) true,' to them say thou when a dispute has
arisen, 'Here is no opponent<sup>\[2\]</sup> for thee.' (832)

   10. Those who wander about after having secluded themselves, without
opposing view to view--what (opposition) wilt thou meet with amongst
those, O Pasûra, by whom nothing in this world is grasped as the best?
(833)

   11. Then thou wentest to reflection thinking in thy mind over the
(different philosophical) views; thou hast gone into the yoke with him
who has shaken off (al1 sin), but thou wilt not be able to proceed
together (with him)<sup>\[3\]</sup>. (834)

thing) full of water and excrement? I do not even want to touch it with
my foot.' (835)

   2. Mâgandiya: 'If thou dost not want such a pearl, a woman desired by
many kings, what view, virtue, and (holy) works, (mode of) life,
re-birth dost thou profess?' (836)

   3. '"This I say," so (I do now declare), after investigation there is
nothing amongst the doctrines which such a one (as I would) embrace, O
Mâgandiya,'-- so said Bhagavat,--'and seeing (misery) in the
(philosophical) views, without adopting (any of them), searching (for
truth) I saw "inward peace<sup>\[1\]</sup>."' (837)

   4. 'All the (philosophical) resolutions<sup>\[2\]</sup> that have
been formed,'--so said Mâgandiya,--'those indeed thou explainest without

grasping spring up? For want of what is there no egotism, by the
cessation of what do the touches not touch? ' (871)

its origin in wish; by the cessation of wishes there is no egotism, by
the cessation of form the touches do not touch.' (872)

the (only) expert (saying), '(He) who understands this, he knows the
Dhamma; he who reviles this, he is not perfect<sup>\[1\]</sup>.' (878)

   2. So having got into contest they dispute: 'The opponent (is) a
fool, an ignorant (person),' so they say. Which one of these, pray, is
the true doctrine (vâda)? for all these assert themselves (to be the
only) expert. (879)

   3. He who does not acknowledge an opponent's doctrine (dhamma), he is
a fool, a beast, one of poor understanding, all are fools with a very
poor understanding; all these abide by their (own) views. (880)

   4. They are surely purified by their own view, they are of a pure
understanding, expert, thoughtful, amongst them there is no one of poor
understanding, their view is quite perfect! (881)

   5. I do not say, 'This is the reality,' which fools say mutually to
each other; they made their own views the truth, therefore they hold
others to be fools. (882)

   6. What some say is the truth, the reality, that others say is void,
false, so having disagreed they dispute. Why do not the Sama*n*as say
one (and the same thing)? (883)

   7. For the truth is one, there is not a second, about which one
intelligent man might dispute with another intelligent man; (but) they
themselves praise different truths, therefore the Sama*n*as do not say
one and the same thing)<sup>\[2\]</sup>. (884)

   8. Why do the disputants that assert themselves (to be the only)
expert, proclaim different truths? Have many different truths been heard
of, or do they (only) follow (their own) reasoning? (885)

   9. There are not many different truths in the world, no eternal ones
except consciousness; but having reasoned on the (philosophical) views
they proclaim a double Dhamma, truth and falsehood<sup>\[1\]</sup>.
(886)

   10. In regard to what has been seen, or heard, virtue and (holy)
works, or what has been thought, and on account of these (views) looking
(upon others) with contempt, standing in (their) resolutions joyful,
they say that the opponent is a fool and an ignorant
person<sup>\[2\]</sup> (?) (887)

   11. Because he holds another (to be) a fool, therefore he calls
himself expert, in his own opinion he is one that tells what is
propitious, others he blames, so he said<sup>\[3\]</sup>. (?) (888)

   12. He is full of his overbearing (philosophical) view, mad with
pride, thinking himself perfect, he is in his own opinion anointed with
the spirit (of genius), for his (philosopbical) view is quite complete.
(889)

   13. If he according to another's report is low, then (he says) the
other is also of a low understanding, and if he himself is accomplished
and wise, there is not any fool amongst the Sama*n*as<sup>\[1\]</sup>.
(890)

   14. 'Those who preach a doctrine (dhamma) different from this, fall
short of purity and are imperfect,' so the Titthiyas say repeatedly, for
they are inflamed by passion for their own (philosophical) views. (891)

   15. Here they maintain purity, in other doctrines (dhamma) they do
not allow purity; so the Titthiyas, entering extensively (upon details),
say that in their own way there is something firm. (892)

   16. And saying that there is something firm in his own way he holds
his opponent to be a fool; thus he himself brings on strife, calling his
opponent a fool and impure (asuddhadhamma). (893)

   17. Standing in (his) resolution, having himself measured (teachers,
&c.), he still more enters into dispute in the world; but having left
all resolutions nobody will excite strife in the world<sup>\[2\]</sup>.

> Philosophers cannot lead to purity, they only praise themselves and

   1. Those who abiding in the (philosophical) views dispute, saying,
'This is the truth,' they all incur blame, and they also obtain praise
in this matter. (895)

   2. This is little, not enough to (bring about) tranquillity, I say
there are two fruits of dispute; having seen this let no one dispute,
understanding Khema (i.e. Nibbâna) to be the place where there is no
dispute. (896)

   3. The opinions that have arisen amongst people, all these the wise
man does not embrace; he is independent. Should he who is not pleased
with what has been seen and heard resort to dependency<sup>\[1\]</sup>?
(?) (897)

   4. Those who consider virtue the highest of all, say that purity is
associated with restraint; having taken upon themselves a (holy) work
they serve. Let us learn in this (view), then, his (the Master's)
purity; wishing for existence they assert themselves to be the only
expert<sup>\[2\]</sup>. (898)

prays for purity in this world, as one who has lost his caravan or

   6. Having left virtue and (holy) works altogether, and both wrong and
blameless work, not praying for purity or impurity, he wanders
abstaining (from both purity and impurity), without having embraced
peace. (900)

   7. By means of penance, or anything disliked, or what has been seen,
or heard, or thought, going upwards they wail for what is pure, without
being free from desire for reiterated existence. (901)

   8. For him who wishes (for something there always are)
desires<sup>\[1\]</sup>, and trembling in (the midst of his) plans; he
for whom there is no death and no re-birth, how can he tremble or desire
anything? (902)

   9. What some call the highest Dhamma, that others again call
wretched; which one of these, pray, is the true doctrine (vâda)? for all
these assert themselves (to be the only) expert. (903)

   10. Their own Dhamma they say is perfect, another's Dhamma again they
say is wretched; so having disagreed they dispute, they each say their
own opinions (are) the truth. (904)

   11. If one (becomes) low by another's censure, then there will be no
one distinguished amongst the Dhammas; for they all say another's Dhamma
(is) low, in their own they say there is something firm<sup>\[2\]</sup>.

   12. The worshipping of their own Dhamma is as great as their praise
of their own ways; all schools would be in the same case, for their
purity is individual<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (906)

   13. There is nothing about a Brâhma*n*a dependent upon others,
nothing amongst the Dhammas which he would embrace after investigation;
therefore he has overcome the disputes, for he does not regard any other
Dhamma as the best. (907)

   14. 'I understand, I see likewise this,' so saying, some by (their
philosophical) views return to purity. If he saw purity, what then (has
been effected) by another's view? Having conquered they say that purity
exists by another<sup>\[2\]</sup>. (?) (908)

   15. A seeing man will see name and form, and having seen he will
understand those (things); let him at pleasure see much or little, for
the expert do not say that purity exists by that. (909)

   16. A dogmatist is no leader to purity, being guided by prejudiced
views, saying that good consists in what he is given to, and saying that
purity is there, he saw the thing so<sup>\[3\]</sup>. (910)

nor a friend of knowledge; and having penetrated the opinions that have
arisen amongst people, he is indifferent to learning, while others
acquire it. (911)

   18. The Muni, having done away with ties here in the world, is no
partisan in the disputes that have arisen; appeased amongst the
unappeased he is indifferent, not embracing learning, while others
acquire it. (912)

   19. Having abandoned his former passions, not contracting new ones,
not wandering according to his wishes, being no dogmatist, he is
delivered from the (philosophical) views, being wise, and he does not
cling to the world, neither does he blame himself. (913)

   20. Being secluded amongst all the doctrines (dhamma), whatever has
been seen, heard, or thought, he is a Muni who has laid down his burden
and is liberated, not belonging to time (na kappiyo), not dead, not
wishing for anything. So said Bhagavat. (914)

> How a Bhikkhu attains bliss, what his duties are, and what he is to
> avoid.

   1. 'I ask thee, who art a kinsman of the Âdi*kk*as and a great Isi,
about seclusion (viveka) and the state of peace. How is a Bhikkhu, after
having seen it, extinguished, not grasping at anything in the world?'
(915)

p. 175

   2. 'Let him completely cut off the root of what is called
papa*ñk*a<sup>\[1\]</sup> (delusion), thinking "I am wisdom;"'--so said
Bhagavat,--'all the desires that arise inwardly, let him learn to subdue
them, always being thoughtful. (916)

   3. 'Let him learn every Dhamma inwardly or outwardly; let him not
therefore be proud, for that is not called bliss by the good. (917)

   4. 'Let him not therefore think himself better (than others or) low
or equal (to others); questioned by different people, let him not adorn
himself<sup>\[2\]</sup>. (918)

   5. 'Let the Bhikkhu be appeased inwardly, let him not seek peace from
any other (quarter); for him who is inwardly appeased there is nothing
grasped or rejected. (919)

   6. 'As in the middle (i.e. depth) of the sea no wave is born, (but as
it) remains still<sup>\[3\]</sup>, so let the Bhikkhu be
still<sup>\[3\]</sup>, without desire, let him not desire anything
whatever.' (920)

   7. He with open eyes expounded clearly the Dhamma that removes (all)
dangers; tell (now) the religious practices; the precepts or
contemplation<sup>\[4\]</sup>. (921)

   8. Bhagavat: 'Let him not be greedy with his eyes, let him keep his
ears from the talk of the town, let him not be greedy after sweet
things, and let him not desire anything in the world. (922)

   9. 'When he is touched by the touch (of illness),

p. 176

let the Bhikkhu not lament, and let him not wish for existence anywhere,
and let him not tremble at dangers. (923)

   10. 'Having obtained boiled rice and drink, solid food and clothes,
let him not store up (these things), and let him not be anxious, if he
does not get them. (924)

   11. 'Let him be meditative, not prying, let him abstain from
misbehaviour<sup>\[1\]</sup>, let him not be indolent, let the Bhikkhu
live in his quiet dwelling. (925)

   12. 'Let him not sleep too much, let him apply himself ardently to
watching, let him abandon sloth, deceit, laughter, sport, sexual
intercourse, and adornment. (926)

   13. 'Let him not apply himself to practising (the hymns of) the
Âthabba*n*a(-veda), to (the interpretation of) sleep and signs, nor to
astrology; let not (my) follower (mâmaka) devote himself to
(interpreting) the cry of birds, to causing impregnation, nor to (the
art of) medicine. (927)

   14. 'Let the Bhikkhu not tremble at blame, nor puff himself up when
praised; let him drive off covetousness together with avarice, anger,
and slander. (928)

   15. 'Let the Bhikkhu not be engaged in purchase and sale, let him not
blame others in anything, let him not scold in the village, let him not
from love of gain speak to people. (929)

   16. 'Let not the Bhikkhu be a boaster, and let him not speak
coherent<sup>\[2\]</sup> language; let him not learn pride, let him not
speak quarrelsome language. (930)

   17. 'Let him not be led into falsehood, let him not consciously do
wicked things; and with respect to livelihood, understanding, virtue,
and (holy) works let him not despise others. (931)

   18. 'Having heard much talk from much-talking Sama*n*as let him not
irritated answer them with harsh language; for the good do not
thwart<sup>\[1\]</sup> others. (932)

   19. 'Having understood this Dhamma, let the investigating and always
thoughtful Bhikkhu learn; having conceived bliss to consist in peace,
let him not be indolent in Gotama's commandments. (933)

   20. 'For he a conqueror unconquered saw the Dhamma visibly, without
any traditional instruction<sup>\[2\]</sup>; therefore let him learn,
heedful in his, Bhagavat's, commandments, and always worshipping.' (934)

Tuva*t*akasutta is ended.

## 15. ATTADA*ND*ASUTTA.

> Description of an accomplished Muni.

   1. From him who has seized a stick fear arises. Look at people
killing (each other); I will tell of grief as it is known to me. (935)

   2. Seeing people struggling like fish in (a pond with) little water,
seeing them obstructed by each other, a fear came over me. (936)

   3. The world is completely unsubstantial, all quarters are shaken;
wishing for a house for myself I did not see (one) uninhabited. (937)

   4. But having seen (all beings) in the end obstructed, discontent
arose in me; then I saw in

\[1. Pa*t*isenikaronti.

2\. Sakkhi dhamma*m* anîtiham adassî.\]

p. 178

this world an arrow, difficult to see, stuck in the heart. (938)

   5. He who has been pierced by this arrow runs through all quarters;
but having drawn out that arrow, he will not run, he will sit down
(quietly). (939)

   6. There (many) studies are gone through; what is tied in the world
let him not apply himself to (untie) it; having wholly transfixed
desire, let him learn his own extinction (nibbâna). (940)

   7. Let the Muni be truthful, without arrogance, undeceitful, free
from slander, not angry, let him overcome avarice. (941)

   8. Let the man who has turned his mind to Nibbâna conquer sleepiness,
drowsiness, and sloth; let him not live together with indolence, let him
not indulge in conceit. (942)

   9. Let him not be led into falsehood, let him not turn his affection
to form; let him penetrate arrogance, let him wander abstaining from
violence. (943)

   10. Let him not delight in what is old, let him not bear with what is
new, let him not grieve for what is lost, let him not give himself up to
desire<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (944)

   11. (This desire) I call greed, the great stream, I call (it)
precipitation, craving, a trouble, a bog of lust difficult to
cross<sup>\[2\]</sup>. (945)

   12. The Muni who without deviating from truth

stands fast on the firm ground (of Nibbâna, being) a Brâhma*n*a, he,
having forsaken everything, is indeed called calm. (946)

   13. He indeed is wise, he is accomplished, having understood the
Dhamma independent (of everything); wandering rightly in the world he
does not envy any one here. (947)

   14. Whosoever has here overcome lust, a tie difficult to do away with
in the world, he does not grieve, he does not covet<sup>\[1\]</sup>,
having cut off the stream, and being without bonds. (948)

   15. What is before (thee), lay that aside; let there be nothing
behind thee; if thou wilt not grasp after what is in the middle, thou
wilt wander calm<sup>\[2\]</sup>. (949)

   16. The man who has no desire at all for name and form
(individuality) and who does not grieve over what is no more, he indeed
does not decay in the world<sup>\[3\]</sup>. (950)

   17. He who does not think, 'this is mine' and 'for others there is
also something,' he, not having egotism, does not grieve at having
nothing<sup>\[4\]</sup>. (951)

   18. Not being harsh, not greedy, being without desire, and being the
same under all circumstances (samo<sup>\[5\]</sup>),--that I call a good
result, when asked about an undaunted man. (952)

discerning (man) there is no Sa*m*khâra; abstaining from every sort of
effort he sees happiness everywhere<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (953)

   20. The Muni does not reckon himself amongst the plain, nor amongst
the low, nor amongst the distinguished; being calm and free from
avarice, he does not grasp after nor reject anything<sup>\[2\]</sup>.
(954)

Attada*nd*asutta is ended.

## 16. SÂRIPUTTASUTTA.

> On Sâriputta asking what a Bhikkhu is to devote himself to, Buddha
> shows what life he is to lead.

   1. 'Neither has before been seen by me,'--so said the venerable
Sâriputta,--'nor has any one heard of such a beautifully-speaking
master, a teacher arrived from the Tusita heaven. (955)

   2. 'As he, the clearly-seeing, appears to the world of men and gods,
after having dispelled all darkness, so he wanders alone in the midst
(of people). (956)

   3. 'To this Buddha, who is independent, unchanged, a guileless
teacher, who has arrived (in the world), I have come supplicatingly with

seat, the root of a tree or a cemetery, or (who lives) in the caves of
the mountains, (958)

at which the Bhikkhu does not tremble in his quiet dwelling! (959)

   6. 'How many dangers (are there not) in the world for him who goes to
the immortal region<sup>\[1\]</sup>, (dangers) which the Bhikkhu
overcomes in his distant dwelling! (960)

   7. 'Which are his words, which are his objects in this world, which
are the virtue and (holy) works of the energetic Bhikkhu? (961)

   8. 'What study having devoted himself to, intent on one
object<sup>\[2\]</sup>, wise and thoughtful, can he blow off his own
filth as the smith (blows off) that of the silver<sup>\[3\]</sup>?'
(962)

   9. 'What is pleasant for him who is disgusted (with birth, &c.), O
Sâriputta,'--so said Bhagavat,--'if he cultivates a lonely
dwelling-place, and loves perfect enlightenment in accordance with the
Dhamma, that I will tell thee as I understand it. (963)

   10. 'Let not the wise and thoughtful Bhikkhu wandering on the
borders<sup>\[4\]</sup> be afraid of the five dangers: gad-flies and
(all other) flies<sup>\[5\]</sup>, snakes, contact with (evil)
men<sup>\[6\]</sup>, and quadrupeds. (964)

heat, let him, touched by them in many ways, and being houseless, make
strong exertions. (966)

   13. 'Let him not commit theft, let him not speak falsely, let him
touch friendly what is feeble or strong, what he acknowledges to be the
agitation of the mind, let him drive that off as a partisan of Ka*n*ha
(i.e. Mâra). (967)

   14. 'Let him not fall into the power of anger and arrogance; having
dug up the root of these, let him live, and let him overcome both what
is pleasant and what is unpleasant. (968)

   15. 'Guided by wisdom, taking delight in what is good, let him
scatter those dangers, let him overcome discontent in his distant
dwelling, let him overcome the four causes of lamentation. (969)

   16. 'What shall I eat, or where shall I eat?--he lay indeed
uncomfortably (last night)--where shall I lie this night? let the Sekha
who wanders about houseless subdue these lamentable doubts. (970)

   17. 'Having had in (due) time both food and clothes, let him know

(things) and wandering restrained in the village let him, even (if he
be) irritated, not speak harsh words. (971)

meditation, very watchful; having acquired equanimity let him with a

which he must learn thoughtfully,--let him overcome passion for form,
sound and taste, smell and touch. (974)

   21. 'Let the Bhikkhu subdue his wish for these Dhammas and be
thoughtful, and with his mind well liberated, then in time he will,
reflecting upon Dhamma, and having become intent upon one object,
destroy darkness.' So said Bhagavat. (975)
