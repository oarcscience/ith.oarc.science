## 1. URAGASUTTA.

> The Bhikkhu who discards all human passions is compared to a snake
> that casts his skin.--Text and translation in Fr. Spiegel's Anecdota
> Pâlica.

   1. He who restrains his anger when it has arisen, as (they) by
medicines (restrain) the poison of the snake spreading (in the body),
that Bhikkhu leaves this and the further shore, as a snake (quits its)
old worn out skin. (1)

   2. He who has cut off passion entirely, as (they cut off) the
lotus-flower growing in a lake, after diving (into the water), that
Bhikkhu leaves this and the further shore, as a snake (quits its) old
worn out skin. (2)

   3. He who has cut off desire entirely, the flowing, the quickly
running, after drying it up, that Bhikkhu leaves this and the further
shore, as a snake (quits its) old worn out skin. (3)

very frail bridge of reeds, that Bhikkhu leaves this and the further
shore, as a snake (quits its) old worn out skin. (4)

looks for flowers on fig-trees, that Bhikkhu leaves this and the further
shore, as a snake (quits its) old worn out skin. (5)

Bhikkhu leaves this and the further shore, as a snake (quits its) old

overcame all this (world of) delusion, that Bhikkhu leaves this and the
further shore, as a snake (quits its) old worn out skin. (8)

## 2. DHANIYASUTTA.

> A dialogue between the rich herdsman Dhaniya and Buddha, the one
> rejoicing in his worldly security and the other in his religious
> belief.--This beautiful dialogue calls to mind the parable in the
> [Gospel of S. Luke xii.16](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#12:16.md).

   1. 'I have boiled (my) rice, I have milked (my cows),'--so said the
herdsman Dhaniya,--'I am living together with my fellows near the banks
of the Mahî (river), (my) house is covered, the fire is kindled:
therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (18)

   2. 'I am free from anger, free from stubbornness,'--so said
Bhagavat,--'I am abiding for one night near the banks of the Mahî
(river), my house

p. 4

is uncovered, the fire (of passions) is extinguished: therefore, if thou
like, rain, O sky!' (19)

   3. 'Gad-flies are not to be found (with me),'--so said the herdsman
Dhaniya,--'in meadows abounding with grass the cows are roaming, and
they can endure rain when it comes: therefore, if thou like, rain, O
sky!' (20)

   4. '(By me) is made a well-constructed raft,'--so said Bhagavat,--'I
have passed over (to Nibbâna), I have reached the further bank, having
overcome the torrent (of passions); there is no (further) use for a
raft: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (21)

   5. 'My wife is obedient, not wanton,'--so said the herdsman
Dhaniya,--'for a long time she has been living together (with me), she
is winning, and I hear nothing wicked of her: therefore, if thou like,
rain, O sky!' (22)

   6. 'My mind is obedient, delivered (from all worldliness),'--so said
Bhagavat,--'it has for a long time been highly cultivated and
well-subdued, there is no longer anything wicked in me: therefore, if
thou like, rain, O sky!' (23)

   7. 'I support myself by my own earnings,'--so said the herdsman
Dhaniya,--'and my children are (all) about me, healthy; I hear nothing
wicked of them: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (24)

   8. 'I am no one's servant,'--so said Bhagavat,--'with what I have
gained I wander about in all the world, there is no need (for me) to
serve: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (25)

   9. 'I have cows, I have calves,'-- so said the herdsman Dhaniya;--'I
have cows in calf and heifers, and I have also a bull as lord over the
cows: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (26)

p. 5

   10. 'I have no cows, I have no calves,'--so said Bhagavat,--'I have
no cows in calf and no heifers, and I have no bull as a lord over the
cows: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky! (27)

   11. 'The stakes are driven in, and cannot be shaken,'--so said the
herdsman Dhaniya,--'the ropes are made of mu*ñg*a grass, new and
well-made, the cows will not be able to break them: therefore, if thou
like, rain, O sky!' (28)

   12. 'Having, like a bull, rent the bonds; having, like an elephant,
broken through the galu*kkh*i creeper, I shall not again enter into a
womb: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (29)

   Then at once a shower poured down, filling both sea and land. Hearing
the sky raining, Dhaniya spoke thus:

   13. 'No small gain indeed (has accrued) to us since we have seen
Bhagavat; we take refuge in thee, O (thou who art) endowed with the eye
(of wisdom); be thou our master, O great Muni!' (30)

   14. 'Both my wife and myself are obedient; (if) we lead a holy life
before Sugata, we shall conquer birth and death, and put an end to
pain.' (31)

   15. 'He who has sons has delight in sons,'--so said the wicked
Mâra,--'he who has cows has delight likewise in cows; for upadhi
(substance) is the delight of man, but he who has no upadhi has no
delight.' (32)

   16. 'He who has sons has care with (his) sons,'--so said
Bhagavat,--'he who has cows has likewise care with (his) cows; for
upadhi (is the cause of) people's cares, but he who has no upadhi has no
care.' (33)

Dhaniyasutta is ended.

## 3. KHAGGA VISÂ*N*ASUTTA.

> Family life and intercourse with others should be avoided, for society
> has all vices in its train; therefore one should leave the corrupted
> state of society and lead a solitary life.

then) the pain which follows affection; considering the misery that

loses (his own) advantage, having a fettered mind; seeing this danger in
friendship let one wander alone like a rhinoceros. (36)

other, such is) the care one has with children and wife; (but) like the
shoot of a bamboo not clinging (to anything) let one wander alone like a

rhinoceros. (40)

wise, let him, overcoming all dangers, wander about with him glad and,

righteous and wise, then as a king abandoning (his) conquered kingdom,
let him wander alone like a rhinoceros<sup>\[2\]</sup>. (45)

   13. Surely we ought to praise the good luck of having companions, the

acquired such friends let one, enjoying (only) allowable things, wander
alone like a rhinoceros<sup>\[3\]</sup>. (46)

   14. Seeing bright golden (bracelets), well-wrought by the goldsmith,
striking (against each other when there are) two on one arm, let one

considering this danger in future, let one wander alone like a
rhinoceros. (48)

   16. The sensual pleasures indeed, which are various, sweet, and
charming, under their different shapes agitate the mind; seeing the
misery (originating) in sensual pleasures, let one wander alone like a

leaving the herd walks at pleasure in the forest, even so let one wander
alone like a rhinoceros. (52)

   20. For him who delights in intercourse (with others, even) that is
inconvenient which tends to temporary deliverance; reflecting on the
words of (Buddha) the kinsman of the Âdi*kk*a family, let one wander
alone like a rhinoceros. (53)

   21. The harshness of the (philosophical) views I have overcome, I
have acquired self-command, I have attained to the way (leading to
perfection), I am in possession of knowledge, and not to be led by
others; so speaking, let one wander alone like a rhinoceros. (54)

   22. Without covetousness, without deceit, without

\[1. Comp. *G*âtaka I p. 93.\]

craving, without detraction, having got rid of passions and folly, being
free from desire in all the world, let one wander alone like a
rhinoceros. (55)

   23. Let one avoid a wicked companion who teaches what is useless and

senses guarded, with his mind protected free from

passion, not burning (with lust), let one wander alone like a
rhinoceros. (62)

sake of advantage; friends without a motive are now difficult to get,
men know their own profit and are impure; (therefore) let one wander

Khaggavisâ*n*asutta is ended.

## 4. KASIBHÂRADVÂ*G*ASUTTA.

> The Brâhma*n*a Kasibhâradvâ*g*a reproaches Gotama with idleness, but
> the latter convinces him that he (Buddha) also works, and so the
> Brâhma*n*a is converted, and finally becomes a saint. Compare Sp.
> Hardy, A Manual of Buddhism, p. 214; [Gospel of S. John v.
> 17](../../bib/kjv/joh.htm#5:17.md).

   So it was heard by me:

   At one time Bhagavat dwelt in Magadha at Dakkhi*n*âgiri in the
Brâma*n*a village Ekana*l*â. And at that time the Brâma*n*a
Kasibhâradvâ*g*a's five hundred

\[1. Pantânîti dûrâni senâsanânîti vasati*tth*ânâni. Commentator.

2\. Comp. [Dhp. v. 20](sbe1003.htm#pp_20.md).\]

p. 12

ploughs were tied (to the yokes) in the sowing season. Then Bhagavat, in
the morning, having put on his raiment and taken his bowl and robes,
went to the place where the Brâma*n*a Kasibhâradvâ*g*a's work (was going
on). At that time the Brâma*n*a Kasibhâradvâ*g*a's distribution of food
took place. Then Bhagavat went to the place where the distribution of
food took place, and having gone there, he stood apart. The Brâma*n*a
Kasibhâradvâ*g*a saw Bhagavat standing there to get alms, and having
seen him, he said this to Bhagavat:

   'I, O Sama*n*a, both plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, I
eat; thou also, O Sama*n*a, shouldst plough and sow, and having ploughed
and sown, thou shouldst eat.'

   'I also, O Brâma*n*a, both plough and sow, and having ploughed and
sown, I eat,' so said Bhagavat.

   'Yet we do not see the yoke, or the plough, or the ploughshare, or
the goad, or the oxen of the venerable Gotama.'

   And then the venerable Gotama spoke in this way:

   'I also, O Brâma*n*a, both plough and sow, and having ploughed and
sown, I eat,' so said Bhagavat.

   Then the Brâma*n*a Kasibhâradvâ*g*a addressed Bhagavat in a stanza:

   1. 'Thou professest to be a ploughman, and yet we do not see thy
ploughing; asked about (thy) ploughing, tell us (of it), that we may
know thy ploughing.' (75)

   2. Bhagavat answered: 'Faith is the seed, penance the rain,
understanding my yoke and plough, modesty the pole of the plough, mind
the tie, thoughtfulness my ploughshare and goad. (76)

   3. 'I am guarded in respect of the body, I am

p. 13

guarded in respect of speech, temperate in food; I make truth to cut
away (weeds), tenderness is my deliverance. (77)

   4. 'Exertion is my beast of burden; carrying (me) to Nibbâna he goes
without turning back to the place where having gone one does not grieve.
(78)

   5. 'So this ploughing is ploughed, it bears the fruit of immortality;
having ploughed this ploughing one is freed from all pain.' (79)

   Then the Brâma*n*a Kasibhâradvâ*g*a, having poured rice-milk into a
golden bowl, offered it to Bhagavat, saying, 'Let the venerable Bhagavat
eat of the rice-milk; the venerable is a ploughman, for the venerable
Gotama ploughs a ploughing that bears the fruit of immortality.'

   6. Bhagavat said: 'What is acquired by reciting stanzas is not to be
eaten by me; this is, O Brâma*n*a, not the Dhamma of those that see
rightly; Buddha rejects what is acquired by reciting stanzas, this is
the conduct (of Buddhas) as long as the Dhamma exists. (80)

   7. 'One who is an accomplished great Isi, whose passions are
destroyed and whose misbehaviour has ceased, thou shouldst serve with
other food and drink, for this is the field for one who looks for good
works<sup>\[1\]</sup>.' (81)

   'To whom then, O Gotama, shall I give this rice-milk?' so said
Kasibhâradvâ*g*a.

   'I do not see, O Brâma*n*a, in the world (of men)

\[1. A*ññ*ena *k*a kevalina*m* mahesi*m*  
     Khî*n*âsava*m* kukku*kk*avûpasanta*m*

     Khetta*m* hi ta*m* pu*ññ*apekhassa hoti.  
Cf. [Sundarikabhâradvâ*g*a v. 28](sbe1035.htm#pp_481.md).\]

p. 14

and gods and Mâras and Brahmans, amongst beings comprising gods and men,
and Sama*n*as and Brâma*n*as, any by whom this rice-milk when eaten can
be properly digested with the exception of Tathâgata, or a disciple of
Tathâgata. Therefore, O Brâma*n*a, thou shalt throw this rice-milk in (a
place where there is) little grass, or cast it into water with no worms:
so said Bhagavat.

   Then the Brâma*n*a Kasibhâradvâ*g*a threw the rice-milk into some
water with no worms. Then the rice-milk thrown into the water splashed,
hissed, smoked in volumes; for as a ploughshare that has got hot during
the day when thrown into the water splashes, hisses, and smokes in
volumes, even so the rice-milk (when) thrown into the water splashed,
hissed, and smoked in volumes.

   Then the Brâma*n*a Kasibhâradvâ*g*a alarmed and terrified went up to
Bhagavat, and after having approached and fallen with his head at
Bhagavat's feet, he said this to Bhagavat:

   'It is excellent, O venerable Gotama! It is excellent, O venerable
Gotama! As one raises what has been overthrown, or reveals what has been
hidden, or tells the way to him who has gone astray, or holds out an oil
lamp in the dark that those who have eyes may see the objects, even so
by the venerable Gotama in manifold ways the Dhamma (has been)
illustrated. I take refuge in the venerable Gotama and in the Dhamma and
in the Assembly of Bhikkhus; I wish to receive the pabba*gg*â, I wish to
receive the upasampadâ (the robe and the orders) from the venerable
Gotama,' so said Kasibhâradvâ*g*a.

   Then the Brâma*n*a Kasibhâradvâ*g*a received the

p. 15

pabba*gg*â from Bhagavat, and he received also the upasampadâ; and the
venerable Bhâradvâa*g*a having lately received the upasampadâ, leading a
solitary, retired, strenuous, ardent, energetic life, lived after having
in a short time in this existence by his own understanding ascertained
and possessed himself of that highest perfection of a religious life for
the sake of which men of good family rightly wander, away from their
houses to houseless state. 'Birth had been destroyed, a religious life
had been led, what was to be done had been done, there was nothing else
(to be done) for this existence,' so he perceived, and the venerable
Bhâradvâa*g*a became one of the arahats (saints).

Kasibhâradvâ*g*asutta is ended.

## 5. *K*UNDASUTTA.

> Buddha describes the four different kinds of Sama*n*as to *K*unda, the
> smith.

   1. 'I ask the Muni of great understanding,'--so said *K*unda, the
smith,--'Buddha, the lord of the Dhamma, who is free from desire, the
best of bipeds, the most excellent of charioteers, how many (kinds of)
Sama*n*as are there in the world; pray tell me that?' (82)

   2. 'There are four (kinds of) Sama*n*as, (there is) not a fifth, O
*K*unda,'--so said Bhagavat,--'these I will reveal to thee, being asked
in person; (they are) Magga*g*inas and Maggadesakas, Magga*g*îvins and
Maggadûsins.' (83)

   3. 'Whom do the Buddhas call a Magga*g*ina?'--so said *K*unda, the
smith,--'How is a Magga*ggh*âyin

p. 16

unequalled? Being asked, describe to me a Magga*g*îvin, and reveal to me
a Maggadûsin.' (84)

   4. Bhagavat said: 'He who has overcome doubt, is without pain,
delights in Nibbâna, is free from greed, a leader of the world of men
and gods, such a one the Buddhas call a magga*g*ina (that is, victorious
by the way). (85)

   5. 'He who in this world having known the best (i.e. Nibbâna) as the
best, expounds and explains here the Dhamma, him, the doubt-cutting

   So it was heard by me:

   At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Sâvatthî, in *G*etavana, in the park of
Anâthapi*nd*ika. Then when the night had gone, a certain deity of a
beautiful appearance, having illuminated the whole *G*etavana, went up
to Bhagavat, and having approached and saluted him, he stood apart, and
standing apart that deity addressed Bhagavat in stanzas:

   1. 'We ask (thee), Gotama, about a man that suffers loss; having come
to ask, Bhagavat, (tell us) what is the cause (of loss) to the losing
(man).' (90)

   2. Bhagavat: 'The winner is easily known, easily known (is also) the
loser: he who loves Dhamma is the winner, he who hates Dhamma is the
loser.' (91)

   3. Deity: 'We know this to be so, this is the first loser; tell (us)
the second, O Bhagavat, what is the cause (of loss) to the losing
(man).' (92)

   4. Bhagavat: 'Wicked men are dear to him, he does not do anything
that is dear to the good, he approves of the Dhamma of the wicked,--that
is the cause (of loss) to the losing (man).' (93)

   5. Deity: 'We know this to be so, this is the second loser; tell us
the third, O Bhagavat, what is the cause (of loss) to the losing (man).'
(94)

   6. Bhagavat: 'The man who is drowsy, fond of society and without
energy, lazy, given to anger,--that is the cause (of loss) to the losing
(man).' (95)

p. 18

   7. Deity: 'We know this to be so, this is the third loser; tell us
the fourth, O Bhagavat, what is the cause (of loss) to the losing
(man).' (96)

   8. Bhagavat: 'He who being rich does not support mother or father who
are old or past their youth,--that is the cause (of loss) to the losing
(man).' (97)

   9. Deity: 'We know this to be so, this is the fourth loser; tell us
the fifth, O Bhagavat, what is the cause (of loss) to the losing (man).'
(98)

Sama*n*a or any other mendicant,--that is the cause (of loss) to the
losing (man).' (99)

   11. Deity: 'We know this to be so, this is the fifth loser; tell us
the sixth, O Bhagavat, what is the cause (of loss) to the losing (man).'
(100)

   12. Bhagavat: 'The man who is possessed of much property, who has
gold and food, (and still) enjoys alone his sweet things,--that is the
cause (of loss) to the losing (man).' (101)

his family, despises his relatives,--that is the cause (of loss) to the
losing (man).' (103)

losing (man).' (105)

(man).' (108)

breasts like the timbaru fruit, and for jealousy of her cannot
sleep,--that is the cause (of loss) to the losing (man).' (109)

   21. Deity: 'We know this to be so, this is the tenth loser; tell us
the eleventh, O Bhagavat, what is the cause (of loss) to the losing
(man).' (110)

   22. Bhagavat: 'He who places in supremacy a woman given to drink and
squandering, or a man of the same kind,--that is the cause (of loss) to
the losing (man).' (111)

   23. Deity: 'We know this to be so, this is the eleventh loser; tell
us the twelfth, O Bhagavat, what is the cause (of loss) to the losing
(man).' (112)

   24. Bhagavat: 'He who has little property, (but) great desire, is
born in a Khattiya family and wishes for the kingdom in this
world,--that is the cause (of loss) to the losing (man).' (113)

   25. Having taken into consideration these losses in the world, the
wise, venerable man, who is endowed with insight, cultivates the happy
world (of the gods).' (114)

   So it was heard by me: At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Sâvatthî, in
*G*etavana, in the park of Anâthapi*nd*ika. Then Bhagavat having put on
his raiment in the morning, and having taken his bowl and his robes,
entered Sâvatthî for alms. Now at that time in the house of the
Brâma*n*a Aggikabhâradvâ*g*a the fire was blazing, the offering brought
forth. Then Bhagavat going for alms from house to house in Sâvatthî went
to the house of the Brâma*n*a Aggikabhâradvâ*g*a. The Brâma*n*a
Aggikabhâradvâ*g*a saw Bhagavat coming at a distance, and seeing him he
said this: 'Stay there, O Shaveling; (stay) there, O Sama*n*aka (i.e.
wretched Sama*n*a); (stay) there, O Vasalaka (i.e. outcast)!'

   This having been said, Bhagavat replied to the Brâma*n*a
Aggikabhâradvâ*g*a: 'Dost thou know, O Brâma*n*a, an outcast, or the
things that make an outcast?'

   'No, O venerable Gotama, I do not know an outcast, or the things that
make an outcast; let the venerable Gotama teach me this so well that I
may know an outcast, or the things that make an outcast."

   'Listen then, O Brâma*n*a, attend carefully, I will tell (thee).'

   'Even so, O venerable one,' so the Brâma*n*a Aggikabhâradvâ*g*a
replied to Bhagavat.

p. 21

   Then Bhagavat said this:

   1. 'The man who is angry and bears hatred, who is wicked and
hypocritical, who has embraced wrong views, who is deceitful, let one
know him as an outcast. (115)

   2. 'Whosoever in this world harms living beings, whether once or
twice born, and in whom there is no compassion for living beings, let
one know him as an outcast. (116)

   3. 'Whosoever destroys or lays siege to villages and towns, and is
known as an enemy, let one know him as an outcast. (117)

   4. 'Be it in the village or in the wood, whosoever appropriates by
theft what is the property of others and what has not been given, let
one know him as an outcast. (118)

   5. 'Whosoever, having really contracted a debt, runs away when called
upon (to pay), saying, "There is no debt (that I owe) thee," let one
know him as an outcast. (119)

   6. 'Whosoever for love of a trifle having killed a man going along
the road, takes the trifle, let one know him as an outcast. (120)

   7. 'The man who for his own sake or for that of others or for the
sake of wealth speaks falsely when asked as a witness, let one know him
as an outcast. (121)

   8. 'Whosoever is seen with the wives of relatives or of friends
either by force or with their consent, let one know him as an outcast.
(122)

   9. 'Whosoever being rich does not support mother or father when old
and past their youth, let one know him as an outcast. (123)

   10. 'Whosoever strikes or by words annoys mother

p. 22

or father, brother, sister, or mother-in-law, let one know him as an
outcast. (124)

   11. 'Whosoever, being asked about what is good, teaches what is bad
and advises (another, while) concealing (something from him), let one
know him as an outcast. (125)

   12. 'Whosoever, having committed a bad deed, hopes (saying), "Let no
one know me" (as having done it, who is) a dissembler, let one know him
as an outcast. (126)

   13. 'Whosoever, having gone to another's house and partaken of his
good food, does not in return honour him when he comes, let one know him
as an outcast. (127)

   14. 'Whosoever by falsehood deceives either a Brâhma*n*a or a
Sama*n*a or any other mendicant, let one know him as an outcast. (128)

   15. 'Whosoever by words annoys either a Brâhma*n*a or a Sama*n*a when
meal-time has come and does not give (him anything), let one know him as
an outcast. (129)

   16. 'Whosoever enveloped in ignorance in this world predicts what is
not (to take place), coveting a trifle, let one know him as an outcast.
(130)

   17. 'Whosoever exalts himself and despises others, being mean by his
pride, let one know him as an outcast. (131)

   18. 'Whosoever is a provoker and is avaricious, has sinful desires,
is envious, wicked, shameless, and fearless of sinning, let one know him
as an outcast. (132)

   19. 'Whosoever reviles Buddha or his disciple, be he a wandering
mendicant (paribbâ*g*a) or a householder (gaha*tth*a), let one know him
as an outcast. (133)

p. 23

   20. 'Whosoever without being a saint (arahat) pretends to be a saint,
(and is) a thief in all the worlds including that of Brahman, he is
indeed the lowest outcast; (all) these who have been described by me to
you are indeed called outcasts. (134)

   21. 'Not by birth does one become an outcast, not by birth does one
become a Brâma*n*a; by deeds one becomes an outcast, by deeds one
becomes a Brâma*n*a. (135)

   22. 'Know ye this in the way that this example of mine (shows): There
was a *K*a*nd*âla of the Sopâka caste, well known as Mâta<u>n</u>ga.
(136)

   23. 'This Mâta<u>n</u>ga reached the highest fame, such as was very
difficult to obtain, and many Khattiyas and Brâma*n*as went to serve
him. (137)

   24. 'He having mounted the vehicle of the gods, (and entered) the
high road (that is) free from dust, having abandoned sensual desires,
went to the Brahma world. (138)

   25. 'His birth did not prevent him from being re-born in the Brahma
world; (on the other hand) there are Brâma*n*as, born in the family of
preceptors, friends of the hymns (of the Vedas), (139)

   26. 'But they are continually caught in sinful deeds, and are to be
blamed in this world, while in the coming (world) hell (awaits them);
birth does not save them from hell nor from blame. (140)

   27. '(Therefore) not by birth does one become an outcast, not by
birth does one become a Brâma*n*a, by deeds one becomes an outcast, by
deeds one becomes a Brâma*n*a.' (141)

   This having been said, the Brâma*n*a Aggikabhâradvâ*g*a answered
Bhagavat as follows:

   'Excellent, O venerable Gotama! Excellent, O

p. 24

venerable Gotama! As one, O venerable Gotama, raises what has been
overthrown, or reveals what has been hidden, or tells the way to him who
has gone astray, or holds out an oil lamp in the dark that those who
have eyes may see the objects, even so by the venerable Gotama in
manifold ways the Dhamma has been illustrated; I take refuge in the
venerable Gotama and in the Dhamma and in the Assembly of Bhikkhus. Let
the venerable Gotama accept me as an upâsaka (a follower, me) who
henceforth for all my life have taken refuge (in him).'

night has come,'--so said the Yakkha Sâtâgira,--'let us (go and) see the
renowned Master Gotama.' (152)

   2. 'Is the mind of such a one well disposed towards all beings?'--so
said the Yakkha Hemavata,--'are his thoughts restrained as to things
wished for or not wished for?' (153)

   3. 'His mind is well disposed towards all beings, (the mind) of such
a one,'--so said the Yakkha Sâtâgira,--'and his thoughts are restrained
as to things wished for or not wished for.' (154)

   4. 'Does he not take what has not been given (to him)?'--so said the
Yakkha Hemavata,--'is he self-controlled (in his behaviour) to living
beings? is he far from (a state of) carelessness? does he not abandon
meditation?' (155)

   5. 'He does not take what has not been given (to him),'--so said the
Yakkha Sâtâgira,--'and he is self-controlled (in his behaviour) to
living beings, and he is far from (a state of) carelessness; Buddha does
not abandon meditation.' (156)

   6. 'Does he not speak falsely?'--so said the Yakkha Hemavata,--'is he
not harsh-spoken? does he not utter slander? does he not talk nonsense?'
(157)

   7. 'He does not speak falsely,'--so said the Yakkha Sâtâgira,--'he is
not harsh-spoken, he does not utter slander, with judgment he utters
what is good sense.' (158)

   8. 'Is he not given to sensual pleasures?'--so said the Yakkha
Hemavata,--'is his mind undisturbed? has he overcome folly? does he see
clearly in (all) things (dhammas)?' (159)

   9. 'He is not given to sensual pleasures,'--so said the Yakkha
Sâtâgira,--'and his mind is undisturbed;

he has overcome all folly; Buddha sees clearly in (all) things.' (160)

   10. 'Is he endowed with knowledge?'--so said the Yakkha
Hemavata,--'is his conduct pure? have his passions been destroyed? is
there no new birth (for him)?' (161)

   11. 'He is endowed with knowledge,'--so said the Yakkha
Sâtâgira,--'and his conduct is pure; all his passions have been
destroyed; there is no new birth for him. (162)

who is accomplished by his knowledge and conduct, let us (go and) see.

who is thin, who is wise, living on little food, not covetous, the Muni

and does not look for sensual pleasures, let us ask about the (means of)
deliverance from the snares of death. (165)

penetrated all things, Buddha who has overcome hatred and fear.' (166)

   16. 'In what has the world originated?'--so said the Yakkha
Hemavata,--'with what is the world intimate? by what is the world
afflicted, after having grasped at what?' (167)

   17. 'In six the world has originated, O Hemavata,'--so said
Bhagavat,--'with six it is intimate, by six the world is afflicted,
after having grasped at six.' (168)

   18. Hemavata said: 'What is the grasping by

which the world is afflicted? Asked about salvation, tell (me) how one
is released from pain?' (169)

   19. Bhagavat said: 'Five pleasures of sense are said to be in the
world, with (the pleasure of) the mind as the sixth; having divested
oneself of desire for these, one is thus released from pain. (170)

   20. 'This salvation of the world has been told to you truly, this I
tell you: thus one is released from pain.' (171)

existence)? who in this world crosses the sea? who does not sink into
the deep, where there is no footing and no support?' (172)

   22. Bhagavat said: 'He who is always endowed with virtue, possessed
of understanding, well composed, reflecting within himself, and
thoughtful, crosses the stream that is difficult to cross. (173)

   23. 'He who is disgusted with sensual pleasures, who has overcome all
bonds and destroyed joy, such a one does not sink into the deep.' (174)

   24. Hemavata said: 'He who is endowed with a profound understanding,
seeing what is subtile, possessing nothing, not clinging to sensual
pleasures, behold him who is in every respect liberated, the great Isi,
walking in the divine path. (175)

## 10. Â*L*AVAKASUTTA.

> The Yakkha Â*l*avaka first threatens Buddha, then puts some questions
> to him which Buddha answers, whereupon Â*l*avaka is converted.

   So it was heard by me:

   At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Â*l*avî, in the realm of the Yakkha
Â*l*avaka. Then the Yakkha Â*l*avaka went to the place where Bhagavat
dwelt, and having gone there he said this to Bhagavat:

   'Come out, O Sama*n*a!'

   'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat came out.

   'Enter, O Sama*n*a!'

   'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat entered.

   A second time the Yakkha Â*l*avaka said this to Bhagavat: 'Come out,
O Sama*n*a!'

   'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat came out.

   'Enter, O Sama*n*a!'

   'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat entered.

   A third time the Yakkha Â*l*avaka said this Bhagavat: 'Come out, O
Sama*n*a!'

   ' Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat came out.

   'Enter, O Sama*n*a!'

\[1. Dhammassa *k*a sudhammatam.\]

p. 30

   'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat entered.

   A fourth time the Yakkha Â*l*avaka said this to Bhagavat: 'Come out,
O Sama*n*a!'

   'I shall not come out to thee, O friend, do what thou pleasest.'

   'I shall ask thee a question, O Sama*n*a, if thou canst not answer
it, I will either scatter thy thoughts or cleave thy heart, or take thee
by thy feet and throw thee over to the other shore of the Ga<u>n</u>gâ.'

   'I do not see, O friend, any one in this world nor in the world of
gods, Mâras, Brahmans, amongst the beings comprising gods, men,
Sama*n*as, and Brâhma*n*as, who can either scatter my thoughts or cleave
my heart, or take me by the feet and throw me over to the other shore of
the Ga<u>n</u>gâ; however, O friend, ask what thou pleasest.'

   Then the Yakkha Â*l*avaka addressed Bhagavat in stanzas:

   1. 'What in this world is the best property for a man? what, being
well done, conveys happiness? what is indeed the sweetest of sweet
things? how lived do they call life the best?' (180)

   2. Bhagavat said: 'Faith is in this world the best property for a
man; Dhamma, well observed, conveys happiness; truth indeed is the
sweetest of things; and that life they call the best which is lived with
understanding.' (181)

   3. Â*l*avaka said: 'How does one cross the stream (of existence)? how
does one cross the sea? how does one conquer pain? how is one purified?'
(182)

   4. Bhagavat said: 'By faith one crosses the stream, by zeal the sea,
by exertion one conquers pain, by understanding one is purified.' (183)

p. 31

   5. Â*l*avaka said: 'How does one obtain understanding? how does one
acquire wealth? how does one obtain fame? how does one bind friends (to
himself)? how does one not grieve passing away from this world to the
other?' (184)

   6. Bhagavat said: 'He who believes in the Dhamma of the venerable
ones as to the acquisition of Nibbâna, will obtain understanding from
his desire to hear, being zealous and discerning. (185)

   7. 'He who does what is proper, who takes the yoke (upon him and)
exerts himself, will acquire wealth, by truth he will obtain fame, and
being charitable he will bind friends (to himself). (186)

   8. 'He who is faithful and leads the life of a householder, and
possesses the following four Dhammas (virtues), truth, justice (dhamma),
firmness, and liberality,--such a one indeed does not grieve when
passing away. (187)

   9. 'Pray, ask also other Sama*n*as and Brâhma*n*as far and wide,
whether there is found in this world anything greater than truth,
self-restraint, liberality, and forbearance.' (188)

   10. Â*l*avaka said: 'Why should I now ask Sama*n*as and Brâhma*n*as
far and wide? I now know what is my future good. (189)

   11. 'For my good Buddha came to live at Â*l*avî; now I know where
(i.e. on whom bestowed) a gift will bear great fruit. (190)

   12. 'I will wander about from village to village, from town to town,
worshipping the perfectly enlightened (sambuddha) and the perfection of
the Dhamma.' (191)

> Buddha only sees the body as it really is, and consequently goes to
> Nibbâna.--Comp. *G*âtaka I, p. 146.

   1. If either walking or standing, sitting or lying, any one contracts
(or) stretches (his body, then) this is the motion of the body. (192)

   2. The body which is put together with bones and sinews, plastered
with membrane and flesh, and covered with skin, is not seen as it really
is. (193)

   3. It is filled with the intestines, the stomach, the lump of the
liver, the abdomen, the heart, the lungs, the kidneys, the spleen. (194)

   4. With mucus, saliva, perspiration, lymph, blood, the fluid that
lubricates the joints, bile, and fat. (195)

   5. Then in nine streams impurity flows always from it; from the eye
the eye-excrement, from the ear the ear-excrement, (196)

   6. Mucus from the nose, through the mouth it ejects at one time bile
and (at other times) it ejects phlegm, and from (all) the body come
sweat and dirt. (197)

   7. Then its hollow head is filled with the brain. A fool led by
ignorance thinks it a fine thing. (198)

   8. And when it lies dead, swollen and livid, discarded in the
cemetery, relatives do not care (for it). (199)

   9. Dogs eat it and jackals, wolves and worms; crows and vultures eat
it, and what other living creatures there are. (200)

   10. The Bhikkhu possessed of understanding in this world, having
listened to Buddha's words, he

p. 33

certainly knows it (i.e. the body) thoroughly, for he sees it as it
really is. (201)

   11. "As this (living body is) so is that (dead one), as this is so
that (will be<sup>\[1\]</sup>); let one put away desire for the body,
both as to its interior and as to its exterior." (202)

   12. Such a Bhikkhu who has turned away from desire and attachment,
and is possessed of understanding in this world, has (already) gone to
the immortal peace, the unchangeable state of Nibbâna. (203)

   13. This (body) with two feet is cherished (although) impure,
ill-smelling, filled with various kinds of stench, and trickling here
and there. (204)

   14. He who with such a body thinks to exalt himself or despises
others--what else (is this) but blindness? (205)

Vi*g*ayasutta is ended.

## 12. MUNISUTTA.

> Definition of a Muni.

   1. From acquaintanceship arises fear, from house-life arises
defilement; the houseless state, freedom from acquaintanceship--this is
indeed the view of a Muni. (206)

   2. Whosoever, after cutting down the (sin that has) arisen, does not
let (it again) take root and does not give way to it while springing up
towards him, him

\[1. Yathâ ida*m* tathâ eta*m*  
     Yathâ eta*m* tathâ idam.\]

p. 34

the solitarily wandering they call a Muni; such a great Isi has seen the
state of peace<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (207)

   3. Having considered the causes (of sin, and) killed the seed, let
him not give way to desire for it; such a Muni who sees the end of birth
and destruction (i.e. Nibbâ*n*a), after leaving reasoning behind, does
not enter the number (of living beings)<sup>\[2\]</sup>. (208)

   4. He who has penetrated all the resting-places<sup>\[3\]</sup> (of
the mind, and) does not wish for any of them,--such a Muni indeed, free
from covetousness and free from greediness, does not gather up
(resting-places), for he has reached the other shore. (209)

   5. The man who has overcome everything, who knows everything, who is
possessed of a good understanding, undefiled in all things (dhamma),
abandoning everything, liberated in the destruction of desire (i.e.
Nibbâ*n*a), him the wise style a Muni<sup>\[4\]</sup>. (210)

   6. The man who has the strength of understanding, is endowed with
virtue and (holy) works, is composed, delights in meditation, is
thoughtful, free from ties, free from harshness (akhila), and free from
passion, him the wise style a Muni. (211)

   7. The Muni that wanders solitarily, the zealous,

\[1. Yo *g*âtam u*kkh*i*gg*a na ropayeyya  
     *G*âyanta*m* assa nânuppave*kkh*e  
     Tam âhu eka*m* munina*m* *k*aranta*m*,  
     Addakkhi so santipada*m* mahesi.

2\. Sa*m*khâya vatthûni pamâya bî*g*a*m*  
     Sineham assa nânuppave*kkh*e,  
     Sa ve munî *g*âtikhayantadassî  
     Takka*m* pahâya na upeti sa*m*kha*m*.

p. 35

that is not shaken by blame and praise, like a lion not trembling at
noises, like the wind not caught in a net, like a lotus not soiled by
water, leading others, not led by others, him the wise style a Muni.
(212)

   8. Whosoever becomes firm as the post in a bathing-place, in whom
others acknowledge propriety of speech, who is free from passion, and
(endowed) with well-composed senses, such a one the wise style a Muni.
(213)

   9. Whosoever is firm, like a straight shuttle, and is disgusted with
evil actions, reflecting on what is just and unjust, him the wise style
a Muni. (214)

   10. Whosoever is self-restrained and does not do evil, is a young or
middle-aged Muni, self-subdued, one that should not be provoked (as) he
does not provoke any, him the wise style a Muni. (215)

   11. Whosoever, living upon what is given by others, receives a lump
of rice from the top, from the middle or from the rest (of the vessel,
and) does not praise (the giver) nor speak harsh words, him the wise
style a Muni. (216)

   12. The Muni that wanders about abstaining from sexual intercourse,
who in his youth is not fettered in any case, is abstaining from the
insanity of pride, liberated, him the wise style a Muni. (217)

   13. The man who, having penetrated the world, sees the highest truth,
such a one, after crossing the stream and sea (of existence), who has
cut off all ties, is independent, free from passion, him indeed the wise
style a Muni. (218)

   14. Two whose mode of life and occupation are quite different, are
not equal: a householder maintaining a wife, and an unselfish virtuous
man. A householder (is intent) upon the destruction of

p. 36

other living creatures, being unrestrained; but a Muni always protects
living creatures, being restrained. (219)

   15. As the crested bird with the blue neck (the peacock) never
attains the swiftness of the swan, even so a householder does not equal
a Bhikkhu, a secluded Muni meditating in the wood. (220)

Munisutta is ended.

Uragavagga is ended.
