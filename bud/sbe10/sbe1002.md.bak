## INTRODUCTION

TO

## THE DHAMMAPADA.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE DHAMMAPADA, A CANONICAL BOOK.

   THE Dhammapada forms part of the Pâli Buddhist canon, though its
exact place varies according to different authorities, and we have not
as yet a sufficient number of complete MSS. of the Tipi*t*aka to help us
to decide the question<sup>\[1\]</sup>.

   Those who divide that canon into three Pi*t*akas or baskets, the
Vinaya-pi*t*aka, Sutta-pi*t*aka, and Abhidhamma-pi*t*aka, assign the
Dhammapada to the Sutta-pi*t*aka. That Pi*t*aka consists of five
Nikâyas: the Dîgha-nikâya, the Ma*ggh*ima-nikâya, the Sa*m*yutta-nikâya,
the A<u>n</u>guttara-nikâya, and the Khuddaka-nikâya. The fifth, or
Khuddaka-nikâya, comprehends the following works: 1. Khuddaka-pâ*th*a;
2. DHAMMAPADA; 3. Udâna; 4. Itivuttaka; 5. Sutta-nipâta; 6.
Vimânavatthu; 7. Petavatthu; 8. Theragâthâ; 9. Therîgâthâ; 10. *G*âtaka;
11. Niddesa; 12. Pa*t*isambhidâ; 13. Apadâna; 14. Buddhava*m*sa; 15.
*K*ariyâ-pi*t*aka.

   According to another division<sup>\[2\]</sup>, however, the whole
Buddhist canon consists of five Nikâyas: the Dîgha-nikâya, the
Ma*ggh*ima-nikâya, the Sa*m*yutta-nikâya, the A<u>n</u>guttara-nikâya,
and the fifth, the Khuddaka-nikâya, which Khuddaka-nîkaya is then made
to comprehend the whole of the Vinaya (discipline) and Abhidhamma
(metaphysics), together with the fifteen books beginning with the
Khuddaka-pâ*th*a.

   The order of these fifteen books varies, and even, as it would seem,
their number. The Dîghabhâ*n*aka school

\[1. see Feer, Journal Asiatique, 1871, p. 263. There is now at least
one complete MS. of the Tipi*t*aka, the Phayre MS., at the India Office,
and Professor Forchhammer has just published a most useful List of Pâli
MSS. collected in Burma, the largest collection hitherto known.

2\. See Childers, s. v. Nikâya, and extracts from Buddhaghosa's
commentary on the Brahma*g*âla-sutta.\]

p\. x admits twelve books only, and assigns them all to the Abhidhamma,
while the Ma*ggh*imabhâ*n*akas admit fifteen books, and assign them to
the Sutta-pi*t*aka. The order of the fifteen books is: 1. *G*âtaka
\[10\]; 2. Mahâniddesa \[11\]; 3. *K*ullaniddesa \[11\]; 4.
Pa*t*isambhidâmagga \[12\]; 5. Sutta-nipâta \[5\]; 6. DHAMMAPADA \[2\];
7. Udâna \[3\]; 8. Itivuttaka \[4\]; 9. Vimânavatthu \[6\]; 10.
Petavatthu \[7\]; 11. Theragâthâ \[8\]; 12. Therîgâthâ \[9\]; 13.
*K*ariyâ-pi*t*aka \[15\]; 14. Apadâna \[13\]; 15. Buddhava*m*sa
\[14\]<sup>\[1\]</sup>.

   The Khuddaka-pâ*th*a is left out in the second list, and the number
is brought to fifteen by dividing Niddesa into Mahâ-niddesa and
*K*ulla-niddesa.

   There is a commentary on the Dhammapada in Pâli, and supposed to be
written by Buddhaghosa<sup>\[2\]</sup>, in the first half of the fifth
century A.D. In explaining the verses of the Dhammapada, the commentator
gives for every or nearly every verse a parable to illustrate its
meaning, which is likewise believed to have been uttered by Buddha in
his intercourse with his disciples, or in preaching to the multitudes
that came to hear him.

 

DATE OF THE DHAMMAPADA.

   The only means of fixing the date of the Dhammapada is trying to
ascertain the date of the Buddhist canon of which it forms a part, or
the date of Buddhaghosa, who wrote a commentary on it. This, however, is
by no means easy, and the evidence on which we have to rely is such that
we must not be surprised if those who are accustomed to test historical
and chronological evidence

\[1. The figures within brackets refer to the other list of books in the
Khuddaka-nikiya. See also [p. xxviii](#page_xxviii.md).

2\. M. Léon Feer in the Journal Asiatique, 1871, p. 266, mentions
another commentary of a more philosophical character, equally ascribed
to Buddhaghosa. and having the title Vivara Bra Dhammapada, i.e.
L'auguste Dhammapada dévoilé. Professor Forchhammer in his 'List of
Manuscripts,' 1879-80, mentions the following works in connection with
the Dhammapada: Dhammapada-Nissayo; Dh. P. A*tth*akathâ by Buddhaghosa;
Dh. P. A*tth*akathâ Nissayo. 3 vols., containing a complete translation
of the commentary; Dh. P. Va*tth*u. Of printed books he quotes:
Kayanupassanakyam, a work based on the *G*arâvaggo, Mandalay, 1876 (390
pages), and Dhammapada-desanakyam, printed in 'British Burma News.'\]

p\. xi in Greece and Rome, decline to be convinced by it. As a general
rule, I quite agree that we cannot be too sceptical in assigning a date
to ancient books, particularly if we intend to use them as documents for
tracing the history of human thought. To the initiated, I mean to those
who have themselves worked in the mines of ancient Oriental literature,
such extreme scepticism may often seem unscientific and uncalled for.
They are more or less aware of hundreds of arguments, each by itself, it
may be, of small weight, but all combined proving irresistible. They are
conscious, too, of having been constantly on the look out for danger,
and, as all has gone on smoothly, they feel sure that, in the main, they
are on the right road. Still it is always useful to be as incredulous as
possible, particularly against oneself, and to have before our eyes
critics who will not yield one inch beyond what they are forced to yield
by the strongest pressure of facts.

   The age of our MSS. of the canonical books, either in Pâli or
Sanskrit, is of no help to us. All Indian MSS. are comparatively modern,
and one who has probably handled more Indian MSS. than anybody else, Mr.
A. Burnell, has lately expressed his conviction that 'no MS. written one
thousand years ago is now existent in India, and that it is almost
impossible to find one written five hundred years ago, for most MSS.
which claim to be of that date are merely copies of old MSS. the dates
of which are repeated by the copyists<sup>\[1\]</sup>.'

   Nor is the language, whether Sanskrit or Pâli, a safe guide for
fixing dates. Both languages continue to be written to our own time, and
though there are some characteristic marks to distinguish more modern
from more ancient Buddhist Sanskrit and Pâli, this branch of critical
scholarship requires to be cultivated far more extensively and
accurately before true scholars would venture to fix the date of a
Sanskrit or Pâli text on the strength of linguistic evidence
alone<sup>\[2\]</sup>.

\[1. Indian Antiquary, 1880, p. 233.

2\. See some important remarks on this subject in Fausböll's
Introduction to Sutta-nipita, [p. xi](sbe1032.htm#page_xi.md).\]

p\. xii

   The Buddhists themselves have no difficulty in assigning a date to
their sacred canon. They are told in that canon itself that it was
settled at the First Council, or immediately after the death of Buddha,
and they believe that it was afterwards handed down by means of oral
tradition, or actually written down in books by order of Kâ*s*yapa, the
president of the First Council<sup>\[1\]</sup>. Buddhaghosa, a learned
and in some respects a critical scholar, living in the beginning of the
fifth century A.D., asserts that the canon which he had before him, was
the same as that fixed by the First Council<sup>\[2\]</sup>.

   Several European students have adopted the same opinion, and, so far
as I know, no argument has yet been advanced showing the impossibility
of the native view, that some collection of Buddha's doctrines was made
immediately after his death at Râ*g*agaha, and that it was finally
settled at what is called the Second Council, or the Council of Vesâlî.
But what is not impossible is not therefore true, nor can anything be
gained by appealing to later witnesses, such as, for instance, Hiouen
Thsang, who travelled through India in the seventh century, and wrote
down anything that he could learn, little concerned whether one
statement tallied with the other or not<sup>\[3\]</sup>. He says that
the Tipi*t*aka was written down on palm leaves by Kâ*s*yapa at the end
of the First Council. But what can be the weight of such a witness,
living more than a thousand years after the event, compared with that,
for instance, of the Mahâva*m*sa, which dates from the fifth century of
our era, and

\[1. Bigandet, Life of Gaudama (Rangoon, 1866), p. 350; but also p. 120
note.

2\. See Childers, s.v. Tipi*t*aka. There is a curious passage in
Buddhaghosa's account of the First Council. 'Now one may ask,' he says,
'Is there or is there not in this first Parâ*g*ika anything to be taken
away or added?' I reply, There is nothing in the words of the Blessed
Buddha that can be taken away, for the Buddhas speak not even a single
syllable in vain, yet in the words of disciples and devatâs there are
things which may be omitted, and these the elders who made the
recension, did omit. On the other hand, additions are everywhere
necessary, and accordingly, whenever it was necessary to add anything,
they added it. If it be asked, What are the additions referred to? I
reply, Only sentences necessary to connect the text, as 'at that time,'
'again at that time,' 'and so forth.'

3\. Pèlerins Bouddhistes, vol. i. p. 158.\]

p\. xiii tells us in the account of Mahinda's missionary journey to
Ceylon (241/318), that the son of A*s*oka had to spend three years in
learning the Tipi*t*aka by heart from the mouth of a
teacher<sup>\[1\]</sup>? No mention is then made of any books or MSS.,
when it would have been most natural to do so<sup>\[2\]</sup>. At a
later time, during the reign of King Va*tt*agâmani<sup>\[3\]</sup>
(88-76 B.C.), the same chronicle, the Mahâva*m*sa, tells us that 'the
profoundly wise priests had theretofore orally (mukhapâ*th*ena)
perpetuated the Pâli of the Pi*t*akattaya and its A*tth*akathâ
(commentary), but that at this period the priests, foreseeing the
perdition of the people assembled, and in order that the religion might
endure for ages, recorded the same in books (potthakesu
likhâpayu*m*)<sup>\[4\]</sup>.'

   No one has yet questioned the dates of the Dîpava*m*sa, about 400
A.D., or of the first part of the Mahâva*m*sa, between 459-477 A.D., and
though no doubt there is an interval of nearly 600 years between the
composition of the Mahâva*m*sa and the recorded writing down of the
Buddhist canon under Va*tt*agâmani, yet we must remember that the
Ceylonese chronicles were confessedly founded on an older A*tth*akathâ
preserved in the monasteries of the island, and representing an unbroken
line of local tradition.

   My own argument therefore, so long as the question was only whether
we could assign a pre-Christian date to the Pâli Buddhist canon, has
always been this. We have the commentaries on the Pâli canon translated
from Sinhalese into Pâli, or actually composed, it may be, by
Buddhaghosa. Buddhaghosa confessedly consulted various

\[1. Mahâva*m*sa, p. 37; Dîpava*m*sa VII, 28-31; Buddhaghosha's
Parables, p. xviii.

2\. Bigandet, Life of Gaudama, p. 351.

3\. Dr. E. Müller (Indian Antiquary, Nov. 1880, p. 270) has discovered
inscriptions in Ceylon, belonging to Devanapiya Maharâ*g*a Gâmi*n*i
Tissa, whom he identifes with Va*tt*agâmani.

4\. The same account is given in the Dîpava*m*sa XX, 20, and in the
Sârasa<u>n</u>graha, as quoted by Spence Hardy, Legends, p. 192. As
throwing light on the completeness of the Buddhist canon at the time of
King Va*tt*agâmani, it should be mentioned that, according to the
commentary on the Mahâva*m*sa (Turnour, p. liii), the sect of the
Dhammaru*k*ikas established itself at the Abhayavihâra, which had been
constructed by Va*tt*agâmani, and that one of the grounds of their
secession was their refusing to acknowledge the Parivâra (thus I read
instead of Pariwána) as part of the Vinaya-pi*t*aka. According to the
Dîpava*m*sa (VII, 42) Mahinda knew the Parivâra.\]

p\. xiv MSS., and gives various readings, just as any modern scholar
might do. This was in the beginning of the fifth century A.D., and there
is nothing improbable, though I would say no more, in supposing that
some of the MSS., consulted by Buddhaghosa, dated from the first century
B.C., when Va*tt*agâmani ordered the sacred canon to be reduced to
writing.

   There is one other event with reference to the existence of the
sacred canon in Ceylon, recorded in the Mahâva*m*sa, between the time of
Buddhaghosa and Va*tt*agâmani, viz. the translation of the Suttas from
Pâli into the language of Ceylon, during the reign of Buddhadâsa,
339-368 A.D. If MSS. of that ancient translation still existed, they
would, no doubt, be very useful for detrmining the exact state of the
Pâli originals at that time<sup>\[1\]</sup>. But even without them there
seems no reason to doubt that Buddhaghosa had before him old MSS. of the
Pâli canon, and that these were in the main the same as those written
down at the time of Va*tt*agâmani.

 

BUDDHAGHOSA'S AGE.

   The whole of this argument, however, rested on the supposition that
Buddhaghosa's date in the beginning of the fifth century A.D. was beyond
the reach of reasonable doubt. 'His age,' I had ventured to say in the
Preface to Buddhaghosha's Parables (1870), 'can be fixed with greater
accuracy than most dates in the literary history of India.' But soon
after, one of our most celebrated Pâli scholars, the great Russian
traveller, Professor Joh. Minayeff, expressed in the Mélanges Asiatiques
(13/25 April, 1871) the gravest doubts as to Buddhaghosa's age, and thus
threw the whole Buddhist chronology, so far as it had then been accepted
by all, or nearly all scholars, back into chaos. He gave as his chief
reason that Buddhaghosa was not, as I supposed, the contemporary of
Mahânâma, the

\[1. A note is added, stating that several portions of the other two
divisions also of the Pi*t*akattaya were translated into the Sinhalese
language, and that these alone are consulted by the priests, who are
unacquainted with Pâli. On the other hand, it is stated that the
Sinhalese text of the A*tt*hakathâ exists no longer. See Spence Hardy,
Legends, p. xxv, and p. 69.\]

p\. xv author of the Mahâva*m*sa, but of another Mahânâma, the king of
Ceylon.

   Professor Minayeff is undoubtedly right in this, but I am not aware
that I, or anybody else, had ever questioned so palpable a fact. There
are two Mahânâmas; one, the king who reigned from 410-432 A.D.; the
other, the supposed author of the Mahâva*m*sa, the uncle and protector
of King Dhâtusena, 459-477. 'Dhâtusena,' I had written, 'was the nephew
of the historian Mahânâma, and owed the throne to the protection of his
uncle. Dhâtusena was in fact the restorer of a national dynasty, and
after having defeated the foreign usurpers (the Damilo dynasty) "he
restored the religion which had been set aside by the foreigners"'
(Mahâv. p. 256). Among his many pious acts it is particularly mentioned
that he gave a thousand, and ordered the Dîpava*m*sa to be promulgated.
As Mahânâma was the uncle of Dhâtusena, who reigned from 459-477, he may
be considered as a trustworthy witness with regard to events that
occurred between 410 and 432. Now the literary activity of Buddhaghosa
in Ceylon falls in that period<sup>\[1\]</sup>.'

   These facts being admitted, it is surely not too great a stretch of
probability to suppose, as I did, that a man whose nephew was king in
459-477, might have been alive in 410-432, that is to say, might have
been a contemporary of Buddhaghosa. I did not commit myself to any
further theories. The question whether Mahânâma, the uncle of Dhâtusena,
was really the author of the Mahâva*m*sa, the question whether he wrote
the second half of the 37th chapter of that work, or broke off his
chronicle in the middle of that chapter, I did not discuss, having no
new materials to bring forward beyond those on which Turnour and those
who followed him had founded their conclusions, and which I had
discussed in my History of Sanskrit Literature (1859), p. 267. All I
said was, 'It is difficult to determine whether the 38th as well as the
(whole of the) 37th chapter came from the pen of Mahânâma, for

\[1. 'Ungefähr 50 Jahre älter als Mahânâma ist Buddhaghosha,' see
Westergaard, Über Buddha's Todesjahr, p. 99.\]

p\. xvi the Mahâva*m*sa was afterwards continued by different writers,
even to the middle of the last century. But, taking into account all the
circumstances of the case, it is most probable that Mahânâma carried on
the history to his own time, to the death of Dhâtusena, 477 A.D.'

   What I meant by 'all the circumstances of the case' might easily be
understood by any one who had read Turnour's Preface to the Mahâva*m*sa.
Turnour himself thought at first that Mahânâma's share in the
Mahâva*m*sa ended with the year 301 A.D., and that the rest of the work,
called the Sulu Wansé, was composed by subsequent
writers<sup>\[1\]</sup>. Dharmakirti is mentioned by name as having
continued the work to the reign of Prâkrama Bâhu (A.D. 1266). But
Turnour afterwards changed his mind<sup>\[2\]</sup>. Considering that
the account of Mahâsena's reign, the first of the Seven Kings,
terminates in the middle of a chapter, at verse 48, while the whole
chapter is called the Sattarâ*g*iko, 'the chapter of the Seven Kings,'
he naturally supposed that the whole of that chapter, extending to the
end of the reign of his nephew Dhâtusena, might be the work of Mahânâma,
unless there were any strong proofs to the contrary. Such proofs, beyond
the tradition of writers of the MSS., have not, as yet, been
adduced<sup>\[3\]</sup>.

   But even if it could be proved that Mahânâma's own pen did not go
beyond the 48th verse of the 37th chapter, the historical
trustworthiness of the concluding portion of that chapter, containing
the account of Buddhaghosa's literary activity, nay, even of the 38th
chapter, would be little affected thereby. We know that both the
Mahâva*m*sa and the somewhat earlier Dîpava*m*sa were founded on the
Sinhalese A*tth*akathâs, the commentaries and chronicles preserved in
the Mahâvihâra at Anurâdhapura. We also know that that Vihâra was
demolished by Mahâsena, and deserted by nearly all its inmates for the
space of nine years (p. 235), and again for the space of nine months

\[1. Introduction, p. ii. The *K*ûlava*m*sa is mentioned with the
Mahâva*m*sa, both as the works of Mahânâma, by Professor Forchhammer in
his List of Pâli MSS.

2\. Introduction, p. xci.

3\. See Rhys Davids, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1875, p.
196.\]

p. xvii (p. 237). We can well understand therefore why the older
history, the Dîpava*m*sa, should end with the death of Mahâsena (died
302 A.D.), and why in the Mahâva*m*sa too there should have been a break
at that date. But we must not forget that, during Mahânâma's life, the
Mahâvihâra at Anurâdhapura was restored, that some kind of chronicle,
called the Dîpava*m*sa, whether it be a general name of any 'chronicle
of the island,' or of our Dîpava*m*sa, or, it may be, even of our
Mahâva*m*sa, was ordered to be published or promulgated (dîpetum) under
Dhâtusena, the nephew and protegé of Mahânâma. Therefore, even if we do
not insist on the personal authorship of Mahânâma, we may certainly
maintain that historical entries had been made in the chronicles of
Anurâdhapura during Dhâtusena's reign, and probably under the personal
auspices of Mahânâma, so that if we find afterwards, in the second half
of the 37th chapter of his Mahâva*m*sa, an account of events which had
happened between the destruction of the Mahâvihâra and the reign of
Dhâtusena, and among them an account of so important an event as the
arrival of Buddhaghosa from Magadha and his translation of the Sinhalese
A*tth*akathâ into the language of Magadha, we may well suppose that they
rest on the authority of native chronicles, written not long after the
events, and that therefore, 'under all the circumstances of the case,'
the age of Buddhaghosa can be fixed with greater accuracy than most
dates in the literary history of India.

   There is one difficulty still remaining with regard to the date of
the historian Mahânâma which might have perplexed Turnour's mind, and
has certainly proved a stumbling-block to myself. Turnour thought that
the author of the commentary on the Mahâva*m*sa, the
Va*m*satthappakâsinî, was the same as the author of the Mahâva*m*sa,
viz. Mahânâma. The date of that commentary, however, as we know now,
must be fixed much later, for it speaks of a schism which took place in
the year 601 A.D., during the reign of Agrabôdhi (also called
Dhâtâpatisso). Turnour<sup>\[1\]</sup> looked

\[1. Introduction, p. liii.\]

p. xviii upon that passage as a later interpolation, because he thought
the evidence for the identity of the author and the commentator of the
Mahâva*m*sa too strong to be set aside. He trusted chiefly to a passage
in the commentary, and if that passage had been correctly rendered, the
conclusion which be drew from it could hardly be resisted. We read in
the Mahâva*m*sa (p. 254):

   'Certain members of the Moriyan dynasty, dreading the power of the
(usurper) Subho, the bâlattho, had settled in various parts of the
country, concealing themselves. Among them there was a certain landed
proprietor Dhâtusena, who had established himself at Nandivâpi. His son
named Dhâtâ, who lived at the village Ambiliyâgo, had two sons,
Dhâtusena and Sîlatissabodhi, of unexceptional descent. Their mother's
brother (Mahânâma), devoted to the cause of religion, continued to
reside (at Anurâdhapura) in his sacerdotal character, at the edifice
built by the minister Dîghasandana. The youth Dhâtusena became a priest
in his fraternity, and on a certain day, while he was chaunting at the
foot of a tree, a shower of rain fell, and a Nâga, seeing him there,
encircled him in his folds, and covered him and his book with his hood.
. . . Causing an image of Mahâ Mahinda to be made, and conveying it to
the edifice (Ambamâlaka) in which the thera's body had been burnt, in
order that be might celebrate a great festival there, and that he might
also promulgate the contents of the Dîpava*m*sa, distributing a thousand
pieces, he caused it to be read aloud<sup>\[1\]</sup>.'

   If we compare with this extract from the Mahâva*m*sa a passage from
the commentary as translated by Turnour, we can well understand how he
arrived at the conclusion that it was written by the same person who
wrote the Mahâva*m*sa.

   Turnour translates (p. liv):

   'Upon these data by me, the thera, who had, with due

\[1. Mr. Turnour added a note in which he states that Dîpava*m*sa is
here meant for Mahâva*m*sa, but whether brought down to this period, or
only to the end of the reign of Mahâsena, to which alone the *T*îkâ
extends, there is no means of ascertaining (p. 257).\]

p. xix solemnity, been invested with the dignified title of Mahânâma,
resident at the parive*n*a founded by the minister Dîghasandana, endowed
with the capacity requisite to record the narrative comprised in the
Mahâva*m*sa, in due order, rejecting only the dialect in which the
Singhalese A*tth*akathâ are written, but retaining their import and
following their arrangement, the history, entitled the Palapadôruva*m*sa
(Padyapadânuva*m*sa), is compiled. As even in times when the despotism
of the ruler of the land, and the horrors arising from the inclemencies
of the seasons, and when panics of epidemics and other visitations
prevailed, this work escaped all injury; and moreover, as it serves to
perpetuate the fame of the Buddhas, their disciples, and the Paché
Buddhas of old, it is also worthy of bearing the title of
Va*m*satthappakâsinî.'

   As the evidence of these two passages in support of the identity of
the author and the commentator of the Mahâva*m*sa seemed to me very
startling, I requested Mr. Rhys Davids to copy for me the passage of the
commentary. The passage runs as follows:

   Yâ ettavatâ mahâva*m*satthânusârakusalena Dîghasanda-senâpatinâ

   Mr. Rhys Davids translates this:

thus undertaken) at a time full of danger of various kinds--such as the
danger from disease, and the danger from drought, and the danger from

conclusion--this (commentary), since it makes known the meaning of the

   This shows clearly that Turnour made a mistake in translating this
exceedingly involved, yet perfectly intelligible, passage, and that so
far from proving that the author of the commentary was the same person
as the author of the text<sup>\[1\]</sup>, it proves the very contrary.
Nay, I feel bound to add, that we might now argue that as the
commentator must have lived later than 601 A.D., the fact that he too
breaks off at verse 48 of chapter 37, seems to show that at his time
also the Mahâva*m*sa did not extend as yet beyond that verse. But even
then, the fact that with the restoration of the Mahâvihâra of
Anurâdhapura an interest in historical studies revived in Ceylon, would
clearly show that we may trust the date of Buddhaghosa, as fixed by the
second part of the 37th chapter of the Mahâva*m*sa, at all events till
stronger evidence is brought forward against such a date.

   Now I am not aware of any such evidence<sup>\[2\]</sup>. On the
contrary, making allowance for a difference of some ten or twenty years,
all the evidence which we can gain from other quarters tends to confirm,
the date of

\[1. Dr. Oldenberg informs me that the commentator quotes various
readings in the text of the Mahâva*m*sa.

2\. The passage, quoted by Professor Minayeff from the Sâsanava*m*sa,
would assign to Buddhaghosa the date of 930-543 = 387 A.D., which can
easily be reconciled with his accepted date. If he is called the
contemporary of Siripâla, we ought to know who that Siripâla is.\]

p. xxi Buddhaghosa<sup>\[1\]</sup>. I therefore feel no hesitation in
here reprinting that story, as we find it in the Mahâva*m*sa, not free
from legendary ingredients, it is true, yet resting, I believe, on a
sound foundation of historical fact.

   'A Brâhman youth, born in the neighbourhood of the terrace of the
great Bo-tree (in Magadha), accomplished in the "vi*gg*â" (knowledge)
and "sippa" (art), who had achieved the knowledge of the three Vedas,
and possessed great aptitude in attaining acquirements; indefatigable as
a schismatic disputant, and himself a schismatic wanderer over
*G*ambudîpa, established himself, in the character of a disputant, in a
certain vihâra<sup>\[2\]</sup>, and was in the habit of rehearsing, by
night and by day with clasped hands, a discourse which he had learned,
perfect in all its component parts, and sustained throughout in the same
lofty strain. A certain Mahâthera, Revata, becoming acquainted with him
there, and (saying to himself), "This individual is a person of profound
knowledge, it will be worthy (of me) to convert him;" enquired, "Who is
this who is braying like an ass?" The Brâhman replied to him, "Thou
canst define, then, the meaning conveyed in the bray of asses." On the
Thera rejoining, "I can define it;" he (the Brâhman) exhibited the
extent of the knowledge he possessed. The Thera criticised each of his
propositions, and pointed out in what respect they were fallacious. He
who had been thus refuted, said, "Well, then, descend to thy own creed;"
and he propounded to him a passage from the Abhidhamma (of the
Pi*t*akattaya). He (the Brâhman) could not divine the signification of
that passage, and enquired, "Whose manta is this?"--"It is Buddha's
manta." On his exclaiming, "Impart it to me;" the Thera replied, "Enter
the sacerdotal order." He who was desirous of acquiring the knowledge of
the Pi*t*akattaya, subsequently coming to this conviction, "This is the
sole road" (to salvation), became a convert to that faith. As he was as
profound in his eloquence (ghosa) as Buddha himself, they conferred on
him the appellation of Buddhaghosa (the

vol. i. p. liii; Hiouen-thsang, III, p. 487 seq.\]

p. xxii voice of Buddha); and throughout the world he became as renowned
as Buddha. Having there (in *G*ambudîpa) composed an original work
called *Ñ*ânodaya (Rise of Knowledge), he, at the same time, wrote the
chapter called A*tth*asâlinî, on the Dhammasa<u>n</u>gani (one of the
commentaries on the Abhidhamma).

   'Revata Thera then observing that he was desirous of undertaking the
compilation of a general commentary on the Pi*t*akattaya, thus addressed
him: "The text alone of the Pi*t*akattaya has been preserved in this
land, the A*tth*akathâ are not extant here, nor is there any version to
be found of the schisms (vâda) complete. The Sinhalese A*tth*akathâ are
genuine. They were composed in the Sinhalese language by the inspired
and profoundly wise Mahinda, who had previously consulted the discourses
(kathâmagga) of Buddha, authenticated at the three convocations, and the
dissertations and arguments of Sâriputta and others, and they are extant
among the Sinhalese. Preparing for this, and studying the same,
translate them according to the rules of the grammar of the Mâgadhas. It
will be an act conducive to the welfare of the whole world."

   'Having been thus advised, this eminently wise personage rejoicing
therein, departed from thence, and visited this island in the reign of
this monarch (i.e. Mahânâma, 410-432). On reaching the Mahâvihâra (at
Anurâdhapura), he entered the Mahâpadhânâ hall, the most splendid of the
apartments in the vihâra, and listened to the Sinhalese A*tth*akathâ,
and the Theravâda, from the beginning to the end, propounded by the
Thera Sa<u>n</u>ghapâla; and became thoroughly convinced that they
conveyed the true meaning of the doctrines of the Lord of Dhamma.
Thereupon paying reverential respect to the priesthood, he thus
petitioned: "I am desirous of translating the A*tth*akathâ; give me
access to all your books." The priesthood, for the purpose of testing
his qualifications, gave only two gâthâs, saying, "Hence prove thy
qualification; having satisfied ourselves on this point, we will then
let thee have all our books." From these (taking these gâthâ for his
text), and p. xxiii consulting the Pi*t*akattaya, together with the
A*tth*akathâ, and condensing them into an abridged form, he composed the
work called the Visuddhimagga. Thereupon, having assembled the
priesthood, who had acquired a thorough knowledge of the doctrines of
Buddha, at the Bo-tree, he commenced to read out the work he had
composed. The devatâs, in order that they might make his (Buddhaghosa's)
gifts of wisdom celebrated among men, rendered that book invisible. He,
however, for a second and third time recomposed it. When he was in the
act of producing his book for the third time, for the purpose of
propounding it, the devatâs restored the other two copies also. The
assembled priests then read out the three books simultaneously. In those
three versions there was no variation whatever from the orthodox
Theravâdas in passages, in words, or in syllables. Thereupon, the
priesthood rejoicing, again and again ferventIy shouted forth, saying,
"Most assuredly this is Metteya (Buddha) himself," and made over to him
the books in which the Pi*t*akattaya were recorded, together with the
A*tth*akathâ. Taking up his residence in the secluded Ganthâkara-vihâra
(at Anurâdhapura), he translated, according to the grammatical rules of
the Mâgadhas, which is the root of all languages, the whole of the
Sinhalese A*tth*akathâ (into Pâli). This proved an achievement of the
utmost consequence to all beings, whatever their language.

   'All the Theras and Â*k*âriyas held this compilation in the same
estimation as the text (of the Pi*t*akattaya). Thereafter, the objects
of his mission having been fulfilled, he returned to *G*ambudîpa, to
worship at the Bo-tree (at Uruvelâya, or Uruvilvâ, in Magadha).'

   Here<sup>\[1\]</sup> we have a simple account of
Buddhaghosa<sup>\[2\]</sup> and

\[1. Mahâva*m*sa, p. 250, translated by Turnour.

2\. The Burmese entertain the highest respect for Buddhaghosa. Bishop
Bigandet, in his Life or Legend of Gaudama (Rangoon, 1866), writes: 'It
is perhaps as well to mention here an epoch which has been, at all
times, famous in the history of Budhism in Burma. I allude to the voyage
which a Religious of Thaton, named Budhagosa, made to Ceylon, in the
year of religion 943 = 400 A.D. The object of this voyage was to procure
a copy of the scriptures. He succeeded in his undertaking. He made use
of the Burmese, or rather Talaing characters, in transcribing the
manuscripts, which were written with the characters of Magatha. The
Burmans lay much stress upon that voyage, and always carefully note down
the year it took place. In fact, it is to Budhagosa that the people
living on the shores of the Gulf of Martaban owe the possession of the
Budhist scriptures. From Thaton, the collection made by Budhagosa was
transferred to Pagan, six hundred and fifty years after it had been
imported from Ceylon.' See ibid. p. 392.\]

p. xxiv his literary labours written by a man, himself a priest, and who
may well have known Buddhaghosa during his stay in Ceylon. It is true
that the statement of his writing the same book three times over without
a single various reading, partakes a little of the miraculous; but we
find similar legends mixed up with accounts of translations of other
sacred books, and we cannot contend that writers who believed in such
legends are therefore altogether unworthy to be believed as historical
witnesses.

   But although the date which we can assign to Buddhaghosa's
translation of the commentaries on the Pâli Tipi*t*aka proves the
existence of that canon, not only for the beginning or the fifth century
of our era, but likewise, though it may be, with less stringency, for
the first century before our era, the time of Va*tt*agâmani, the
question whether Buddhaghosa was merely a compiler and translator of old
commentaries, and more particularly of the commentaries brought to
Ceylon by Mahinda (241 B.C.), or whether he added anything of his
own<sup>\[1\]</sup>, requires to be more carefully examined. The
Buddhists themselves have no difficulty on that point. They consider the
A*tth*akathâs or commentaries as old as the canon itself. To us, such a
supposition seems improbable, yet it has never been proved to be
impossible. The Mahâva*m*sa tells us that Mahinda, the son of A*s*oka,
who had become a priest, learnt the whole of the Buddhist canon, as it
then was, in three years (p. 37)<sup>\[2\]</sup>; and that at the end of
the Third Council he was despatched to Ceylon, in order to establish
there the religion of Buddha (p. 71). The king of Ceylon, Devânampiya
Tissa, was converted, and Buddhism soon became the dominant

2\. He learnt the five Nikâyas, and the seven sections (of the
Abhidhamma); the two Vibha<u>n</u>gas of the Vinaya, the Parivâra and

p. xxv religion of the island, The Tipi*t*aka and the A*tth*akathâ, such
as they had been collected or settled at the Third Council in 242 B.C.,
were brought to Ceylon by Mahinda, who promulgated them orally, the
Tipi*t*aka in Pâli, the A*tth*akathâ in Sinhalese, together with an
additional A*tth*akathâ of his own. It does not follow that Mahinda knew
the whole of that enormous literature by heart, for, as he was supported
by a number of priests, they may well have divided the different
sections among them, following the example of Ânanda and Upâli at the
First Council. The same applies to their disciples also. But the fact of
their transmitting the sacred literature by oral
tradition<sup>\[1\]</sup> was evidently quite familiar to the author of
the Mahâva*m*sa. For when he comes to describe the reign of
Va*tt*agâmani (88-76 B.C.) he simply says: 'The profoundly wise priests
had heretofore orally perpetuated the Pâli Pi*t*akattaya and its
A*tth*akathâ (commentaries). At this period these priests, foreseeing
the perdition of the people (from the perversions of the true
doctrines), assembled; and in order that the religion might endure for
ages, wrote the same in books.' No valid objection has yet been advanced
to our accepting Buddhaghosa's A*tth*akathâs as a translation and new
redaction of the A*tth*akathâs which were reduced to writing under
Va*tt*agâmani<sup>\[2\]</sup>, and these again as a translation of the
old A*tth*akathâs brought to Ceylon by Mahinda<sup>\[3\]</sup>. There is
prima facie evidence in favour of the truth of historical events vouched
for by such works as the Dîpava*m*sa and the Mahâva*m*sa so far back at
least as Mahinda, because we know that historical events were recorded
in the monasteries of Ceylon long before Mahânâma's time. Beyond Mahinda
we move in legendary history, and must be ready to surrender every name
and every date as soon as rebutting evidence has been produced, but not
till then.

   I cannot, therefore, see any reason why we should not treat the
verses of the Dhammapada, if not as the utterances of Buddha, at least
as what were believed by the

the utterances of the founder of their religion; nor can I see that
Professor Minayeff has shaken the date of Buddhaghosa and the general
credibility of the Ceylonese tradition, that he was the translator and
editor of commentaries which had existed in the island for many
centuries; whether from the time of Va*tt*agâmani or from the time of
Mahinda.

 

DATE OF THE BUDDHIST CANON.

   We now return to the question of the date of the Buddhist canon,
which, as yet, we have only traced back to the first century before
Christ, when it was reduced to writing in Ceylon under King
Va*tt*agâmani. The question is, how far beyond that date we may trace
its existence in a collected form, or in the form of the three Pi*t*akas
or baskets. There may be, and we shall see that there is, some doubt as
to the age of certain works, now incorporated in the Tipi*t*aka. We are
told, for instance, that some doubt attached to the canonicity of the
*K*ariyâ-pi*t*aka; the Apadâna, and the Buddhava*m*sa<sup>\[1\]</sup>,
and there is another book of the Abhidhamma-pi*t*aka, the Kathâvatthu,
which was reported to be the work of Tissa Moggaliputta, the president
of the Third Council. Childers, s.v., stated that it was composed by the
apostle Moggaliputtatissa, and delivered by him at the Third
Mahâsa<u>n</u>gîti. The same scholar, however, withdrew this opinion on
p. 507 of his valuable Dictionary, where he says: 'It is a source of
great regret to me that in my article on Kathâvatthuppakara*n*a*m* I
inadvertently followed James D'Alwis in the stupendous blunder of his
assertion that the Kathâvatthu was added by Moggaliputtatissa at the
Third Convocation. The Kathâvatthu is one of the Abhidhamma books,
mentioned by Buddhaghosa as having been rehearsed at the First
Convocation, immediately after Gotama's death; and the passage in
Mahâva*m*sa upon which D'Alwis rests his assertion is as follows,
Kathâvatthuppakarara*n*a*m* paravâdappamaddana*m* abhâsi Tissatthero
*k*a tasmi*m* sa<u>n</u>gîtima*nd*ale, which simply means 'in that
Convocation-assembly

\[1. See Childers, s.v. Nikâya.\]

p. xxvii the Thera Tissa also recited (Buddha's) heresy-crushing
Kathâvatthuppakara*n*a.'

   This mistake, for I quite agree with Childers that it was a mistake,
becomes however less stupendous than at first sight it would appear,
when we read the account given in the Dîpava*m*sa. Here the impression
is easily conveyed that Moggaliputta was the author of the Kathâvatthu,
and that he recited it for the first time at the Third Council. 'Wise
Moggaliputta,' we read<sup>\[1\]</sup>, 'the destroyer of the schismatic
doctrines, firmly established the Theravâda, and held the Third Council.
Having destroyed the different (heretical) doctrines, and subdued many
shameless people, and restored splendour to the (true) faith, he
proclaimed (pakâsayi) (the treatise called) Kathâvatthu.' And again:
'They all were sectarians<sup>\[2\]</sup>, opposed to the Theravâda; and
in order to annihilate them and to make his own doctrine resplendent,
the Thera set forth (desesi) the treatise belonging to the Abhidhamma,
which is called Kathâvatthu<sup>\[3\]</sup>.'

   At present, however, we are not concerned with these smaller
questions. We treat the canon as a whole, divided into three parts, and
containing the books which still exist in MSS., and we want to find out
at what time such a collection was made. The following is a short
abstract of the Tipi*t*aka, chiefly taken from Childers' Pâli
Dictionary:

Khuddaka-nikâya. In the commentary on the Brahma*g*âla-sutta it is said
that the Dîghanikâya professors rehearsed the text of the *G*âtaka, Mahâ
and *K*ulla Niddesa, Pa*t*isambhidâmagga, Suttanipâta, Dhammapada,
Udâna, Itivuttaka, Vimâna, and Petavatthu, Thera and Therî Gâthâ, and
called it Khuddakagantha, and made it a canonical text, forming part of
the Abhidhamma; while the Ma*ggh*imanikâya professors assert that, with
the addition of the *K*ariyâpi*t*aka, Apadâna, and Buddhava*m*sa, the
whole of this Khuddakagantha was included in the Suttapi*t*aka. See

   Taking this collection as a whole we may lay it down as self-evident
that the canon, in its collected form, cannot be older than any of the
events related therein.

   There are two important facts for determining the age of the Pâli
canon, which, as Dr. Oldenberg<sup>\[4\]</sup> has been the first to
show, should take precedence of all other arguments, viz.

   1. That in the Tipi*t*aka, as we now have it, no mention is made of
the so-called Third Council, which took place at Pâ*t*aliputta, under
King A*s*oka, about 242 B.C.

   2. That in the Tipi*t*aka, as we now have it, the First Council of
Râ*g*agaha (477 B.C.) and the Second Council of Vesâlî (377 B.C.) are
both mentioned.

   From these two facts it may safely be concluded that the Buddhist
canon, as handed down to us, was finally closed

\[1. Buddhaghosa does not say whether these were recited at the First
Council.

Ceylon, 1852.

(437-429 B.C.) are all mentioned in the Tipi*t*aka. See Oldenberg,
Zeitschrift der D. M. G., XXXIV. pp. 752, 753.\]

p. xxx after the Second and before, or possibly at, the Third Council.
Nay, the fact that the description of the two Councils stands at the
very end of the *K*ullavagga may be taken, as Dr. Oldenberg remarks, as
an indication that it was one of the latest literary contributions which
obtained canonical authority, while the great bulk of the canon may
probably claim a date anterior to the Second Council.

   This fact, namely, that the collection of the canon, as a whole, must
have preceded the Second Council rests on an argument which does great
credit to the ingenuity of Dr. Oldenberg. The Second Council was
convoked to consider the ten deviations<sup>\[1\]</sup> from the strict
discipline of the earliest times. That discipline had been laid down
first in the Pâtimokkha rules, then in the commentary now included in
the Vibha<u>n</u>ga, lastly in the Mahâvagga and *K*ullavagga. The rules
as to what was allowed or forbidden to a Bhikkhu were most
minute<sup>\[2\]</sup>, and they were so firmly established that no one
could have ventured either to take away or to add anything to them as
they stood in the sacred code. In that code itself a distinction is made
between the offences which were from the first visited with punishment
(pârâ*g*ika and pâ*k*ittiya) and those misdemeanours and crimes which
were put down as punishable at a later time (dukka*t*a and
thulla*kk*aya). With these classes the code was considered as closed,
and if any doubt arose as to the criminality of certain acts, it could
be settled at once by an appeal to the Vinaya-pi*t*aka. Now it so
happens that, with one exception, the ten deviations that had to be
considered at the Second Council, are not provided for in the
Vinaya-pi*t*aka; and I quite agree with Dr. Oldenberg's argument that,
if they had been mentioned in the Vinaya-pi*t*aka, the Second Council
would have been objectless. A mere appeal to chapter and verse in the
existing Pi*t*aka would then have silenced all dissent. On the other
side, if it had been possible to add anything to the canon, as it then
existed, the ten, or nine, deviations might have been condemned

\[1. Oldenberg, Introduction, p. xxix.

2\. Oldenberg, loc. cit. p. xx.\]

p. xxxi by a few additional paragraphs of the canon, without convoking a
new Council.

   I think we may be nearly certain, therefore, that we possess the
principal portion of the Vinaya-pi*t*aka as it existed before the
Council of Vesâlî.

   So far I quite agree with Dr. Oldenberg. But if he proceeds to
argue<sup>\[1\]</sup> that certain portions of the canon must have been
finally settled before even the First Council took place, or was
believed to have taken place, I do not think his arguments conclusive.
He contends that in the Parinibbâna-sutta, which tells of the last days
of Buddha's life, of his death, the cremation of his body, and the
distribution of his relics, and of Subhadda's revolt, it would have been
impossible to leave out all mention of the First Council, if that
Council had then been known. It is true, no doubt, that Subhadda's
disloyalty was the chief cause of the First Council, but there was no
necessity to mention that Council. On the contrary, it seems to me that
the unity of the Parinibbâna-sutta would have been broken if, besides
telling of the last days of Buddha, it had also given a full description
of the Council. The very title, the Sutta of the Great Decease, would
have become inappropriate, if so important a subject as the first
Sa<u>n</u>gîti had been mixed up with it. However, how little we may
trust to such general arguments, is best shown by the fact that in some
very early Chinese renderings of the Hînayâna text of the
Mahâparinibbâna-sutta the story is actually carried on to the First
Council, two (Nos. 552 and 119) mentioning the rehearsal under
Ka*s*yapa, while the third (No. 118) simply states that the Tip*t*aka
was then collected<sup>\[2\]</sup>.

\[1. Loc. cit. pp. xxvi-xxviii.

   We must be satisfied therefore, so far as I can see at present, with
fixing the date, and the latest date, of a Buddhist canon at the time of
the Second Council, 377 B.C. That some works were added later, we know;
that many of the treatises included in the canon existed before that
Council, can hardly be doubted. The second chapter of the Dhammapada,
for instance, is called the Appamâda-vagga, and if the Mahâva*m*sa (p.
25) tells us that at the time when A*s*oka was converted by Nigrodha,
that Buddhist priest explained to him the Appamâda-vagga, we can hardly
doubt that there existed then a collection (vagga) of verses on
Appamâda, such as we now possess in the Dhammapada and in the
Sa*m*yutta-nikâya<sup>\[1\]</sup>.

   With regard to the Vinaya, I should even feel inclined to admit, with
Dr. Oldenberg, that it must have existed in a more or less settled form
before that time. What I doubt is whether such terms as Pi*t*aka,
basket, or Tipi*t*aka, the three baskets, i.e. the canon, existed at
that early time. They have not been met with, as yet, in any of the
canonical books; and if the Dîpava*m*sa (IV, 32) uses the word
'Tipi*t*aka,' when describing the First Council, this is due to its
transferring new terms to older times. If Dr. Oldenberg speaks of a
Dvi-pi*t*aka<sup>\[2\]</sup> as the name of the canon before the third
basket, that of the Abhidhamma, was admitted, this seems to me an
impossible name, because at the time when the Abhidhamma was not yet
recognised as a third part of the canon, the word pi*t*aka had probably
no existence as a technical term<sup>\[3\]</sup>.

   We must always, I think, distinguish between the three portions of
the canon, called the basket of the Suttas, the

3\. Dr. Oldenberg informs me that pi*t*aka occurs in the
Ka<u>n</u>kîsuttanta in the Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya (Turnour's MS., fol. the),
but applied to the Veda. He also refers to the tipi*t*akâ*k*âryas
mentioned in the Western Cave inscriptions as compared with the
Pa*ñk*anekâyâka in the square A*s*oka character inscriptions
(Cunningham, Bharhut, pl. lvi, No. 52). In the Sûtrak*r*id-a<u>n</u>ga
of the *G*ainas, too, the term pi*d*aga*m* occurs (MS. Berol. fol. 77
a). He admils, however, that pi*t*aka or tipi*t*aka, as the technical
name of the Buddhist canon, has not yet been met with in that canon
itself, and defends Dvipi*t*aka only as a convenient term.\]

p. xxxiii basket of Vinaya, and the basket of Abhidhamma, and the three
subjects of Dhamma (sutta), Vinaya, and Abhidhamma, treated in these
baskets. The subjects existed and were taught long before the three
baskets were definitely arranged. Dhamma had originally a much wider
meaning than Sutta-pi*t*aka. It often means the whole teaching of
Buddha; and even when it refers more particularly to the Sutta-pi*t*aka,
we know that the Dhamma there taught deals largely with Vinaya and
Abhidhamma doctrines. Even the fact that at the First Council, according
to the description given in the *K*ullavagga, the Vinaya and Dhamma only
were rehearsed, though proving the absence at that time of the
Abhidhamma, as a separate Pi*t*aka, by no means excludes the subject of
the Abhidhamma having been taught under the head of Dhamma. In the
Mahâkaru*n*âpu*nd*arîka-sûtra the doctrine of Buddha is divided into
Dharma and Vinaya; the Abhidharma is not mentioned. But the same text
knows of all the twelve Dharmaprava*k*anâni<sup>\[1\]</sup>, the 1.
Sûtra; 2. Geya; 3. Vyâkara*n*a; 4. Gâthâ; 5. Udâna; 6. Nidâna; 7.
Avadâna; 8. Itiv*ri*ttaka; 9. *G*âtaka; 10. Vaipulya; 11. Adbhutadharma;
12. Upade*s*a; some of these being decidedly metaphysical.

   To my mind nothing shows so well the historical character both of the
*K*ullavagga and of Buddhaghosa in the Introduction to his commentary on
the Dîgha-nikâya, as that the former, in its account of the First
Council, should know only of the Vinaya, as rehearsed by Upâli, and the
Dhamma, as rehearsed by Ânanda, while the much later Buddhaghosa, in his
account of the First Council<sup>\[2\]</sup>, divides the Dhamma into
two parts, and states that the second part, the Abhidhamma, was
rehearsed after the first part, the Dhamma. Between the time of the
*K*ullavagga and the time of Buddhaghosa the Abhidhamma must have
assumed its recognised position by the side of Vinaya and Sutta. It must
be left to further researches to determine, if possible,

Society of Bengal, vi, p. 510 seq.\]

p. xxxiv the time when the name of pi*t*aka was first used, and when
Tipi*t*aka was accepted as the title of the whole canon.

   Whenever we see such traces of growth, we feel that we are on
historical ground, and in that sense Dr. Oldenberg's researches into the
growth of the Vinaya, previous to the Second Council, deserve the
highest credit. He shows, in opposition to other scholars, that the
earliest elements of Vinaya must be looked for in the short Pâtimokkha
rules, which were afterwards supplemented by explanations, by glosses
and commentaries, and in that form answered for some time every
practical purpose. Then followed a new generation who, not being
satisfied, as it would seem, with these brief rules and comments, wished
to know the occasion on which these rules had been originally
promulgated. What we now call the Vibha<u>n</u>ga, i.e. the first and
second divisions of the Vinaya-pi*t*aka, is a collection of the stories,
illustrating the origin of each rule, of the rules themselves (the
Pâtimokkha), and of the glosses and comments on these rules.

   The third and fourth books, the Mahâvagga and *K*ullavagga, are
looked upon as possibly of a slightly later date. They treat, in a
similar manner as the Vibha<u>n</u>ga, on the rules not included in that
collection, and give a general picture of the outward life of the monks.
While the Vibha<u>n</u>ga deals chiefly with the original so-called
pârâ*g*ika, sa<u>n</u>ghâdisesa, and pâ*k*ittiya offences, the
Khandhaka, i.e. the Mahâvagga and *K*ullavagga, treats of the so-called
dukka*t*a and thulla*kk*aya crimes. The arrangement is the same, story,
rule, and comment succeeding each other in regular sequence. If we
follow the guidance of the Vinaya-pi*t*aka, we should be able to
distinguish the following steps in the growth of Buddhism before the
Second Council of Vesâlî:

Teaching of Buddha and his disciples (543/477 A.D. Buddha's death).

Collection of Pâtimokkha rules (first code).

Comment and glosses on these rules.

Stories in illustration of these rules (vibha<u>n</u>ga).

Mahâvagga and *K*ullavagga (Khandhaka).

Council of Vesâlî for the repression of ten abuses (443/377 A.D.)

Description of First and Second Councils in *K*ullavagga.

   The *K*ulavagga ascribes the settlement of the canon to the First
Council, and does not even claim a revision of that canon for the Second
Council. The Dîpava*m*sa claims a revision of the canon by the 700
Arhats for the Second Council.

 

CHRONOLOGY.

   In order to bring the Council of Vesâlî in connection with the
chronology of the world, we must follow the Buddhist historians for
another century. One hundred and eighteen years after the Council of
Vesâlî they place the anointment of King A*s*oka, during whose reign a
Third Council, under the presidency of Tissa Moggaliputta, took place at
Pâ*t*aliputta, the new capital adopted by that king, instead of
Râ*g*agaha and Vesâlî. This Council is chiefly known to us through the
writings of the southern Buddhists (Dîpava*m*sa, Mahâva*m*sa, and
Buddhaghosa), who belong to the school of Moggaliputta (Theravâda or
Vibha*gg*avâda), which ruled supreme at Pâ*t*aliputta, while Upagupta,
the chief authority of the northern Buddhists, is altogether ignored in
the Pâli chronicles.

   Now it is well known that A*s*oka was the grandson of *K*andagutta,
and *K*andagutta the contemporary of Alexander the Great. Here we see
land, and I may refer to my History of Sanskrit Literature, published in
1859, for the process by which the storm-tossed ship of Indian
chronology has been landed in the harbour of real historical chronology.
We are told by the monks of the Mahâvihâra in Ceylon that A*s*oka was
crowned, according to their computation, 146 + 18 years before the
accession of Du*tth*agâmani, 161 B.C., i.e. 325 B.C.; that between his
coronation and his father's death four years had elapsed (329 B.C.);
that his father Bindusâra had reigned twenty-eight years<sup>\[1\]</sup>
(357-329 B.C.), and Bindusâra's father, Kandagutta,

\[1. Mahâva*m*sa, p. 21.\]

p. xxxvi twenty-four years (381-357). As we know that *K*andagutta, whom
the Ceylonese place 381-357 B.C., was king of India after Alexander's
conquest, it follows that Ceylonese chronology is wrong by more than
half a century. For reasons stated in my History of Sanskrit Literature,
I fix the exact fault in Ceylonese chronology as sixty-six years,
assigning to *K*andagutta the dates 315-291, instead of 381-357. This
gives us 291-263 for Bindusâra, 259 for A*s*oka's abhisheka; 259 + 118 =
377 for the Council of Vesâlî, and 377 + 100 = 477 for Buddha's death,
instead of 543 B.C.

\[1\]

   These dates are, of course, approximate only, and they depend on one
or two points on which people may differ. But, with that reservation, I
see no ground whatever for modifying the chronological system which I
put forward more than twenty years ago. Professor Westergaard and
Professor Kern, who have since suggested different dates for the death
of Buddha, do not really differ from me in principle, but only in their
choice of one or the other alternative, which I readily admit as
possible, but not as more certain than my own. Professor
Westergaard<sup>\[2\]</sup>, for instance, fixes Buddha's death at 368
(370), instead of 477. This seems a wide difference, but it is so in
appearance only.

   Following Justinus, who says that Sandrokyptos<sup>\[3\]</sup> had
conquered the empire of India at the time when Seleucus laid the
foundations of his own greatness, I had accepted 315<sup>\[4\]</sup>,
half-way between the murder of Porus and the taking of Babylon by
Seleucus, as the probable beginning

\[1. According to Bigandet, Life of Gaudama, p. 361, the era of Buddha's
death was introduced by A*g*âta*s*atru, at the conclusion of the First
Council, and began in the year 46 of the older Eetzana era (p. 12). See,
however, Rhys Davids, Num. Orient. vi, p. 38. In the Kâra*nd*a-vyûha, p.
96, a date is given as 300 after the Nirvâ*n*a, 't*ri*tîye varsha*s*ate
gate mama parinirv*ri*tasya.' In the A*s*oka-avadâna we read, mama
nirv*ri*tim ârabhya satavarshagata Upagupto nâma bhikshur utpatsyati.

2\. Über Buddha's Todesjahr (1860), 1862.

3\. The Greek name Sandrokyptus shows that the Pâli corruption
*K*andagutta was not yet the recognised name of the king.

4\. Mr. Rhys Davids accepts 315 B.C. as the date when, after the murder
of king Nanda, *K*andragupta stept into the vacant throne, though he had
begun to count his reign seven or eight years before. Buddhism, p.
22O.\]

p. xxxvii of *K*andragupta's reign. Westergaard prefers 320 as a more
likely date for *K*andragupta, and therefore places the death of the
last Nanda and the beginning of A*s*oka's royal pretensions 268. Here
there is a difference between him and me of five years, which depends
chiefly on the view we take as to the time when Seleucus really laid
what Justinus calls the foundation of his future greatness. Secondly,
Westergaard actually adopts the idea, at which I only hinted as
possible, that the southern Buddhists made two A*s*okas out of one, and
two Councils out of one. Trusting in the tradition that 118 years
elapsed between Buddha's death and the Council under A*s*oka (at
Pâ*t*aliputra), and that the Council took place in the king's tenth year
(as was the case with the imaginary Kâlâ*s*oka's Council), he gets 268 -
10 = 258 as the date of the Council, and 368 or 370 as the date of
Buddha's death<sup>\[1\]</sup>.

   The two points on which Westergaard differs from me, seem to me
questions which should be kept before our mind in dealing with early
Buddhist history, but which, for the present at least, admit of no
definite solution.

   The same remark seems to me to apply to the calculations of another
eminent Sanskrit scholar, Professor Kern<sup>\[2\]</sup>. He lays great
stress on the general untrustworthiness of Indian chronology, and I am
the last to differ from him on that point. He then places the beginning
of *K*andragupta's reign in 322 B.C. Allowing twenty-four years to him
and twenty-eight to his son Bindusâra, he places the beginning of
A*s*oka's reign in 270. A*s*oka's inscriptions would fall about 258. As
A*s*oka reigned thirty-six or thirty-seven years, his death would fall
in 234 or 233 B.C. Like Westergaard, Professor Kern too eliminates
Kâlâ*s*oka, as a kind of chronological A*s*oka, and the Council of
Vai*s*âlî, and therefore places Buddha's death, according to the
northern tradition, 100 or 110 years before Dharmâ*s*oka, i.e. 270 + 100
or + 110 = 370 or 380<sup>\[3\]</sup>; while, according to the southern

\[1. Westergaard. loc. cit. p. 128.

2\. Jaartelling der Zuidelijke Buddhisten, 1873.

3\. See Professor Kern's remark in Indian Antiquary, 1874, p. 79.\]

p. xxxviii tradition, that 118 years elapsed between A*s*oka's accession
and Buddha's death, the Ceylonese monks would seem originally to have
retained 270 + 118<sup>\[1\]</sup> = 388 B.C. as Buddha's Nirvâ*n*a, a
date which, as Professor Kern holds, happens to coincide with the date
assigned to the death of Mahâvira, the founder of the *G*aina religion.

   Here we see again that the moot point is the beginning of
*K*andragupta's reign in accordance with the information supplied by
Greek historians. Professor Kern places it in 322, Westergaard in 320, I
myself in 315. That difference once granted, Dr. Kern's reasoning is the
same as my own. According to the traditions which we follow, Buddha's
death took place 100, 110, 118, or 228 years before A*s*oka. Hence
Professor Westergaard arrives at 368 or 370 B.C., Professor Kern at 370
(380) or 388 B.C., I myself at 477 B.C. Every one of these dates is
liable to certain objections, and if I prefer my own date, 477 B. C., it
is simply because it seems to me liable to neither more nor less
reservations than those of Professor Westergaard and Professor Kern, and
because, so long as we always remember the grounds of our differences,
namely, the beginning of *K*andragupta's reign, and the additional
century, every one of these dates furnishes a good hypothesis to work
on, until we can arrive at greater certainty in the ancient chronology
of India. To my mind all dates beyond *K*andragupta are as yet purely
tentative, resting far more on a chronological theory than on actual
tradition; and though I do not doubt the historical chatacter of the
Council of Vai*s*âlî, I look upon the date assigned to it, on the
authority of the Dîpava*m*sa and Mahâva*m*sa, as, for the present,
hypothetical only.

\[1. When Professor Kern states that the Mahâva*m*sa (p. 22) places the
Third Council 218 years after Buddha's death, this is not so. A*s*oka's
abhisheka takes place in that year. The prophecy that a calamity would
befall their religion, 118 years after the Second Council (Mahâva*m*sa,
p. 28), does not refer to the Council, but to *K*andâ*s*oka's accession,
477 - 218 = 259 B.C.\]

   Though the preceding table, embodying in the main the results at
which I arrived in my History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, still
represents what I hold to be true or most probable with respect to
Indian chronology, previous to the beginning of our era, yet I suppose I
may be expected to say here a few words on the two latest attempts to
fix the date of Buddha's death; the one by Mr. Rhys Davids in the
Numismata Orientalia, Part VI, 1877, the other by Dr. Bühler in the
Indian Antiquary, 1877 and 1878<sup>\[1\]</sup>. Mr. Rhys Davids, to
whom we owe so much for the elucidation of the history of Buddha's
religion, accepts Westergaard's date for the beginning of
*K*andragupta's reign, 320 B.C., instead of 322 (Kern), 315 (myself);
and as he assigns (p. 41) to Bindusâra 25 years instead of 28
(Mahâva*m*sa, p. 21), he arrives at 268 as the year of A*s*oka's
coronation<sup>\[2\]</sup>. He admits that the argument derived from the
mention of the five foreign kings in one of A*s*oka's inscriptions,
dated the twelfth year of his reign, is too precarious to enable us to
fix the date of A*s*oka's reign more definitely, and though, in a
general way, that inscription confirms the date assigned by nearly all
scholars to A*s*oka in the middle of the third century B.C., yet there
is nothing in it that A*s*oka might not have written in 247 quite as
well as in 258-261. What chiefly distinguishes Mr. Rhys Davids'
chronology from that of his predecessors is the shortness of the period
between A*s*oka's coronation and Buddha's death. On the strength of an
examination of the list of kings and the list of the so-called
patriarchs, he reduces the traditional 218 years to 140 or 150, and thus
arrives at 412 B.C. as the probable beginning of the Buddhist era.

   In this, however, I cannot follow him, but have to follow Dr. Bühler.
As soon as I saw Dr. Bühler's first essay on the Three New Edicts of
A*s*oka, I naturally felt delighted at the unexpected confirmation which
he furnished of the date which I had assigned to Buddha's death, 477
B.C. And though I am quite aware of the

\[1. Three New Edicts of A*s*oka, Bombay, 1877; Second Notice, Bombay,
1878.

2\. Mr. Rhys Davids on p. 50 assigns the 35 years of Bindusâra rightly
to the Purâ*n*as, the 38 years to the Ceylon Chronicles.\]

p. xli danger of unexpected confirmations of one's own views, yet, after
carefully weighing the objections raised by Mr. Rhys Davids and
Professor Pischel against Dr. Bühler's arguments, I cannot think that
they have shaken Dr. Bühler's position. I fully admit the difficulties
in the phraseology of these inscriptions: but I ask, Who could have
written these inscriptions, if not A*s*oka? And how, if written by
A*s*oka, can the date which they contain mean anything but 256 years
after Buddha's Nirvâ*n*a? These points, however, have been argued in so
masterly a manner by Dr. Bühler in his 'Second Notice,' that I should be
afraid of weakening his case by adding anything of my own, and must
refer my readers to his 'Second Notice.' Allowing that latitude which,
owing to the doubtful readings of MSS., and the constant neglect of odd
months, we must allow in the interpretation of Buddhist chronology,
A*s*oka is the only king we know of who could have spoken of a
thirty-fourth year since the beginning of his reign and since his
conversion to Buddhism. And if he calls that year, say the very last of
his reign (212 B.C.), 256 after the departure of the Master, we have a
right to say that as early as A*s*oka's time, Buddha was believed to
have died about 477 B.C. Whether the inscriptions have been accurately
copied and rightly read is, however, a more serious question, and the
doubts raised by Dr. Oldenberg (Mahâvagga, p. xxxviii) make a new
collation of the originals absolutely indispensable, before we can
definitely accept Dr. Bühler's interpretation.

   I cannot share Dr. Bühler's opinion<sup>\[1\]</sup> as to the entire
worthlessness of the *G*aina chronology in confirming the date of
Buddha's death. If the *S*vetâmbara *G*ainas place the death of Mahâvîra
470 before Vikramâditya, i.e. 56 B.C. + 470 = 526 B.C.,and the
Digambaras 605, i.e. 78 A.D. deducted from 605 = 527 B.C., this so far
confirms Dr. Bühler's and Dr. Jacobi's brilliant discovery that Mahâvîra
was the same as Niga*nth*a Nâtaputta, who died at Pâvâ during Buddha's
lifetime<sup>\[2\]</sup>. Most likely 527 is too early a date, while
another

\[1. Three Edicts. p. 21; Second Notice. pp. 9, 10.

2\. See Jacobi, Kalpa-sûtra of Bhadrabâhu, and Oldenberg, Zeitschrift
der D.M.G., XXXIV, p. 749.\]

p. xlii tradition fixing Mahâvira's death 155 years before
*K*andragupta<sup>\[1\]</sup>, 470 B.C., is too late. Yet they both show
that the distance between A*s*oka (259-222 B.C.), the grandson of
*K*andragupta (315-291 B.C.), and the contemporaries of Buddha was by
the *G*ainas also believed to be one of two rather than one century.

   When I saw that the date of Buddha's death, 477 B.C., which in my
History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature (1859) I had myself tried to
support by such arguments as were then accessible, had received so
powerful a support by the discovery of the inscriptions of Sahasrâm,
Rûpnâth, and Bairât, due to General Cunningham, who had himself always
been an advocate of the date 477 B.C., and through their careful
decipherment by Dr. Bühler, I lost no time in testing that date once
more by the Dîpava*m*sa, that Ceylonese chronicle having lately become
accessible through Dr. Oldenberg's edition and
translation<sup>\[2\]</sup>. And here I am able to say that, before
having read Dr. Bühler's Second Notice, I arrived, though by a somewhat
different way, at nearly the same conclusions as those so well worked
out by Dr. Bühler in his restoration of the Episcopal Succession
(therâvali) of the Buddhists, and therefore feel convinced that, making
all such allowances as the case requires, we know now as much of early
Buddhist chronology as could be known at the time of A*s*oka's Council,
242 B.C.

   Taking the date of Buddha's death 477 B.C. for granted, I found that
Upâli, who rehearsed the Vinaya at the First Council, 477 B.C., had been
in orders sixty years in the twenty-fourth year of A*g*âta*s*atru, i.e.
461 B.C., which was the sixteenth year A.B. He must
therefore<sup>\[3\]</sup> have been born in 541 B.C., and he died 447
B.C., i.e. thirty years A.D., at the age of 94. This is said to have
been the sixth year of Udâyi, and so it is, 453 - 6 = 447 B.C.

   In the year 461 B.C. Dâ*s*aka received orders from Upâli, who was
then 80 years of age; and when Dâ*s*aka had been

\[1. Oldenberg, loc. cit. p. 750.

3\. Assuming twenty to be the minimum age at which a man could be
ordained.\]

p. xliii in orders forty-five years (Dîpava*m*sa IV, 41), he ordained
*S*aunaka. This would give us 461 - 45 = 416 B.C., while the tenth year
of Nâgadâsa, 429 - 10, would give us 419 A.D. Later on the Dîpava*m*sa
(V, 78) allows an interval of forty years between the ordinations of
Dâ*s*aka and *S*aunaka, which would bring the date of *S*aunaka's
ordination to 421 B.C., instead of 419 or 416 B.C. Here there is a fault
which must be noted. Dâ*s*aka died 461 - 64 = 397 A.D., which is called
the eighth year of *S*i*s*unâga, and so it is 405 - 8 = 397 A.D.

   When *S*aunaka had been in orders forty years, i.e. 416 - 40 = 376,
Kâlâ*s*oka is said to have reigned a little over ten years, i.e. 387 -
11 = 376 A.D., and in that year *S*aunaka ordained Siggava. He died 416
- 66 = 350 A.D., which is called the sixth year of the Ten, while in
reality it is the ninth, 359 - 6 = 353 A.D. If, however, we take 419 as
the year of *S*aunaka's ordination, his death would fall 419 - 66 = 353
B.C.

   Siggava, when he had been in orders sixty-four years, ordained Tishya
Maudgalîputra. This date 376 - 64 = 312 B.C. is called more than two
years after *K*andragupta's accession, and so it very nearly is, 315 - 2
= 313.

   Siggava died when he had been in orders seventy-six years, i.e. 376 -
76 = 300 A.D. This year is called the fourteenth year of *K*andragupta,
which it very nearly is, 315 - 14 = 301.

   When Tishya had been in orders sixty<sup>\[1\]</sup> years, he
ordained Mahendra, 312 - 60 = 252 B.C. This is called six years after
A*s*oka's coronation, 259 - 6 = 253, and so it very nearly is. He died
312 - 80 = 232 B.C., which is called the twenty-sixth year of A*s*oka,
and so it very nearly is.

\[1. I take 60 (80), as given in Dîpava*m*sa V, 95, 107, instead of 66
(86), given in Dîpava*m*sa V. 94.\]

   If we test the dates of this table by the length of time assigned to
each patriarchate, we find that Upâli ruled thirty years, from Buddha's
death, 477 to 447; Dâ*s*aka fifty years. To *S*aunaka forty-four years
are assigned, instead of forty-seven, owing to a fault pointed out
before; and to Siggava fifty-two years, or fifty-five<sup>\[1\]</sup>
instead of fifty. Tishya's patriarchate is said to have lasted
sixty-eight years, which agrees with previous statements.

   Lastly, the years of the death of the six patriarchs, as fixed
according to the reigns of the kings of Magadha, agree extremely well.

   Upâli died in the sixth year of Udâyi, i.e. 453 - 6 = 447 B.C.

   Dâ*s*aka died in the eighth year of *S*i*s*unâga, i.e. 405 - 8 = 397
B.C.

   *S*aunaka died in the sixth year of the Ten, i.e. 359 - 6 = 353 B.C.,
showing again the difference of three years.

\[1. The combined patriarchates of *S*aunaka and Siggava are given as 99
by the Dîpava*m*sa.\]

p. xlv

   Siggava died in the fourteenth year of *K*andragupta, i.e. 315 - 14 =
301 B.C.

   Tishya died in the twenty-sixth or twenty-seventh year of A*s*oka,
i.e. 259 - 27 = 233 B.C.

   This general and more than general agreement between dates taken from
the history of the kings and the history of the patriarchs leaves on my
mind a decided impression of a tradition which, though not strictly
historical, in our sense of the word, represents at all events the
result of such enquiries as could be made into the past ages of Buddhism
at the time of A*s*oka. There are difficulties in that tradition which
would certainly have been avoided, if the whole chronology had been
simply made up: but there is no doubt a certain method too perceptible
throughout, which warns us that we must not mistake a smooth chronology
for solid history.

 

THE TITLE OF DHAMMAPADA.

   The title of Dhammapada has been interpreted in various ways. It is
an ambiguous word, and has been accepted as such by the Buddhists
themselves. Dhamma has many meanings. Under one aspect it means
religion, particularly the religion taught by Buddha, the law which
every Buddhist should accept and observe. Under another aspect dhamma is
virtue, or the realisation of the law.

   Pada also has many meanings. In the Abhidhânapadîpikâ it is explained
by place, protection, Nirvâ*n*a, cause, word, thing, portion, foot,
footstep.

   Hence dhammapada may mean 'footstep of religion,' and thus the title
was first rendered by Gogerly, only that he used the plural instead of
the singular, and called it 'The Footsteps of Religion,' while Spence
Hardy still more freely called it 'The Paths of Religion.' It may be
quite true, as pointed out by Childers, that pada by itself never means
path. But it means footstep, and the footstep towards a thing is much
the same as what we call the path to a thing. Thus we read, verse 21,
'appamâdo amatapadam,' earnestness is the step, i.e. the path that leads
to immortality. p. xlvi Again, 'pamâdo ma*kk*uno padam' can hardly mean
anything but that thoughtlessness is the path of death, is the path that
leads to death. The commentator, too, rightly explains it here by
amatasya adhigamupâya, the means of obtaining immortality, i.e.
Nirvâ*n*a, or simply by upâyo, and even by maggo, the way. If we compare
verses 92 and 93 of our text, and verses 254 and 255, we see that pada
is used synonymously with gati, going. In the same manner dhammapada
would mean the footstep or the footpath of virtue, i.e. the path that
leads to virtue, and supply a very appropriate title for a collection of
moral precepts. In verses 44 and 45 'path of virtue' seems to be the
most appropriate meaning for dhammapada<sup>\[1\]</sup>, and it is
hardly possible to assign any other meaning to it in the following verse
(*K*undasutta, v. 6):

<table data-border="0">

'He who lives restrained and attentive in the way that has been well
pointed out, in the path of the law, cultivating blameless words, such a
Bhikkhu they call a Magga*g*îvi (living in the way).'

   I therefore think that 'Path of Virtue,' or 'Footstep of the Law,'
was the idea most prominent in the mind of those who originally framed
the title of this collection of verses. It seems to me that Buddhaghosa
also took the same view, for the verse which D'Alwis<sup>\[2\]</sup>
quotes from the introduction of Buddhaghosa's commentary,--

> Sampatta-saddhammapado satthâ dhammapada*m* subha*m* Desesi,

and which he translates, 'The Teacher who had reached the very depths
(lit. bottom) of Saddhamma, preached this holy Dhammapada,'--lends
itself far better to another translation, viz. 'The Teacher who had
gained a firm

\[1. Cf. Dhammapada, v. 285, nibbâna*m* sugatena desita*m*.

2\. Buddhist Nirvâ*n*a, p. 62.\]

p. xlvii footing in the Good Law, showed (preached) the holy Path of the
Law.'

   Gogerly, again, who may generally be taken as a faithful
representative of the tradition of the Buddhists still preserved in
Ceylon, translates the title by the 'Footsteps of Religion,' so that
there can be little doubt that the priests of that island accept
Dhammapada in the sense of 'Vestiges of Religion,' or, from a different
point of view, 'The Path of Virtue.'

   M. L. Feer<sup>\[1\]</sup> takes a slightly different view, and
assigning to pada the meaning of foot or base, he translates Dhammapada
by Loi fondamentale, or Base de la Religion.

   But it cannot be denied that the title of Dhammapada was very soon
understood in a different sense also, namely, as 'Sentences of
Religion.' Pada means certainly a foot of a verse, a verse, or a line,
and dhammapadam actually occurs in the sense of a 'religious sentence.'
Thus we read in verse 102, 'Though a man recite a hundred Gâthâs made up
of senseless words, one dhammapadam, i.e. one single word or line of the
law, is better, which if a man hears, he becomes quiet.' But here we see
at once the difficulty of translating the title of 'dhammapadam' by
'religious sentences.' Dhammapadam means one law verse, or wise saw, not
many. Professor Fausböll, who in his excellent edition of the Dhammapada
translated that title by 'a collection of verses on religion,' appeals
to such passages as verses 44 and 102 in support of his interpretation.
But in verse 42 dhammapada*m* sudesita*m*, even if it does not mean the
path of the law, could never mean 'versus legis bene enarratos,' but
only versum legis bene enarratum, as Dr. Fausböll himself renders eka*m*
dhammapada*m*, in verse 102, by unus legis versus. Buddhaghosa, too,
when he speaks of many law verses uses the plural, for
instance<sup>\[2\]</sup>, 'Be it known that the Gâthâ consists of the
Dhammapadâni, Theragâthâ, Therîgâthâ, and those unmixed (detached) Gâthâ
not comprehended in any of the above-named Suttânta.'

\[1. Revue Critique, 1870, p. 378.

2\. D'Alwis, Pâli Grammar, p. 61.\]

p. xlviii

   The only way in which Dhammapada could be defended in the sense of
'Collection of Verses of the Law,' would be if we took it for an
aggregate compound. But such aggregate compounds, in Sanskrit at least,
are possible with numerals only; for instance, tribhuvanam, the three
worlds; *k*aturyugam, the four ages<sup>\[1\]</sup>. It might therefore
be possible in Pâli, too, to form such compounds as da*s*apadam, a
collection of ten padas, a work consisting of ten padas, a decamerone,
but it would in no wise follow that we could in that language attempt
such a compound as Dhammapadam, in order to express a collection of law
verses<sup>\[2\]</sup>. Mr. Beal<sup>\[3\]</sup> informs us that the
Chinese seem to have taken Dhammapada in the sense of 'stanzas of law,'
'law texts,' or 'scripture texts.'

   It should be remembered, also, that the idea of representing life,
and particularly the life of the faithful, as a path of duty or virtue
leading to deliverance, (in Sanskrit dharmapatha,) is very familiar to
Buddhists. The four great truths of their religion<sup>\[4\]</sup>
consist in the recognition of the following principles: 1. that there is
suffering; 2. that there is a cause of that suffering; 3. that such
cause can be removed; 4. that there is a way of deliverance, viz. the
doctrine of Buddha. This way is the ash*t*â<u>n</u>ga-mârga, the
eightfold way<sup>\[5\]</sup>, taught by Buddha, and leading to
Nirvâ*n*a<sup>\[6\]</sup>. The faithful advances on that road, padât
padam,

\[1. See M. M.'s Sanskrit Grammar, &sect; 519.

2\. Mr. D'Alwis' arguments (Buddhist Nirvâ*n*a, pp. 63-67) in support of
this view, viz. the dhammapada may be a collective term, do not seem to
me to strengthen my own conjecture.

   If we make allowance for these ambiguities, inherent in the name of
Dhammapada, we may well understand how the Buddhists themselves play
with the word pada (see v. 45). Thus we read in Mr. Beal's translation

TRANSLATION.

   In translating the verses of the Dhammapada, I have followed the
edition of the Pâli text, published in 1855 by Dr. Fausböll, and I have
derived great advantage from his Latin translation, his notes, and his
copious extracts from Buddhaghosa's commentary. I have also consulted
translations, either of the whole of the Dhammapada, or of portions of
it, by Burnouf, Gogerly<sup>\[2\]</sup>, Upham, Weber, and others.
Though it will be seen that in many places my translation differs from
those of my predecessors, I can only claim for myself the name of a very
humble gleaner in this field of Pâli literature. The greatest credit is
due to Dr. Fausböll, whose editio princeps of the Dhammapada will mark
for ever an important epoch in the history of Pâli scholarship; and
though later critics have been able to point out some mistakes, both in
his text and in his translation, the value of their labours is not to be
compared with that of the work accomplished single-handed by that
eminent Danish scholar.

p. l the Sacred Books of the East, I have been able to avail myself of
'Notes on Dhammapada,' published by Childers in the Journal of the Royal
Asiatic Society (May, 1871), and of valuable hints as to the meaning of
certain words and verses scattered about in the Pâli Dictionary of that
much regretted scholar, 1875. I have carefully weighed the remarks of
Mr. James D'Alwis in his 'Buddhist Nirvâ*n*a, a review of Max Müller's
Dhammapada' (Colombo, 1871), and accepted some of his suggestions. Some
very successful renderings of a number of verses by Mr. Rhys Davids in
his ('Buddhism,' and a French translation, too, of the Dhammapada,
published by Fernand Hû<sup>\[1\]</sup>, have been consulted with
advantage.

   It was hoped for a time that much assistance for a more accurate
understanding of this work might be derived from a Chinese translation
of the Dhammapada<sup>\[2\]</sup>, of which Mr. S. Beal published an
English translation in 1878. But this hope has not been entirely
fulfilled. It was, no doubt, a discovery of great interest, when Mr.
Beal announced that the text of the Dhammapada was not restricted to the
southern Buddhists only, but that similar collections existed in the
north, and had been translated into Chinese. It was equally important
when Schiefner proved the existence of the same work in the sacred canon
of the Tibetans. But as yet neither a Chinese nor a Tibetan translation
of the Pâli Dhammapada has been rendered accessible to us by
translations of these translations into English or German, and what we
have received instead, cannot make up for what we had hoped for.

   The state of the case is this. There are, as Mr. Beal informs us,
four principal copies of what may be called Dhammapada in Chinese, the
first dating from the Wu dynasty, about the beginning of the third
century A.D. This translation, called Fa-kheu-king, is the work of a

Sutra en 42 articles, traduit du Tibetain, par Léon Feer. Paris, 1878.

p. li Shaman Wei-*k*i-lan and others. Its title means 'the Sûtra of Law
verses,' kheu being explained by gâthâ, a verse, a word which we shall
meet with again in the Tibetan title, Gâthâsa<u>n</u>graha. In the
preface the Chinese translator states that the Shamans in after ages
copied from the canonical scriptures various gâthâs, some of four lines
and some of six, and attached to each set of verses a title, according
to the subject therein explained. This work of extracting and collecting
is ascribed to Tsun-*k*e-Fa-kieou, i.e. Ârya-Dharmatrâta, the author of
the Sa*m*yuktâbhidharma-*s*âstra and other works, and the uncle of
Vasumitra. If this Vasumitra was the patriarch who took a prominent part
in the Council under Kanishka, Dharmatrâta's collection would belong to
the first century B.C.; but this is, as yet, very doubtful.

   In the preface to the Fa-kheu-king we are told that the original,
which consisted of 500 verses, was brought from India by Wai-*k*i-lan in
223 A.D., and that it was translated into Chinese with the help of
another Indian called Tsiang-sin. After the translation was finished,
thirteen sections were added, making up the whole to 752 verses, 14,580
words, and 39 chapters<sup>\[1\]</sup>.

   If the Chinese translation is compared with the Pâli text, it appears
that the two agree from the 9th to the 35th chapter (with the exception
of the 33rd), so far as their subjects are concerned, though the Chinese
has in these chapters 79 verses more than the Pâli. But the Chinese
translation has eight additional chapters in the beginning (viz. On
Intemperance, Inciting to Wisdom; The *S*râvaka, Simple Faith,
Observance of Duty, Reflection, Loving-kindness, Conversation), and four
at the end (viz. Nirvâ*n*a, Birth and Death, Profit of Religion, and
Good Fortune), and one between the 24th and 25th chapter of the Pâli
text (viz. Advantageous Seivice), all of which are absent in our Pâli
texts. This, the most ancient

760. In the Pâli text, too, there are five verses more than stated in
the Index; see M.M., Buddhaghosha's Parables, p. ix, note; Beal, loc.
cit. p. 11. note.\]

p. lii Chinese translation of Dharmatrâta's work, has not been rendered
into English by Mr. Beal, but he assures us that it is a faithful
reproduction of the original. The book which he has chosen for
translation is the Fa-kheu-pi-ü, i.e. parables connected with the
Dhammapada, and translated into Chinese by two Shamans of the western
Tsin dynasty (A.D. 265-313). These parables are meant to illustrate the
teaching of the verses, like the parables of Buddhaghosa, but they are
not the same parables, nor do they illustrate all the verses.

   A third Chinese version is called *K*uh-yan-king, i.e. the Sûtra of
the Dawn (avadâna?), consisting of seven volumes. Its author was
Dharmatrâta, its translator *K*u-fo-nien (Buddhasm*ri*ti), about 410
A.D. The MS. of the work is said to have been broght from India by a
Shaman Sa<u>n</u>ghabhada<u>n</u>ga of Kipin (Cabul), about 345 A.D. It
is a much more extensive work in 33 chapters, the last being, as in the
Pâli text, on the Brâhma*n*a.

   A fourth translation dates from the Sung dynasty (800 or 900 A.D.),
and in it, too, the authorship of the text is ascribed to
Ârya-Dharmatrâta.

   A Tibetan translation of a Dhammapada was discovered by Schiefner in
the 28th volume of the Sûtras, in the collection called Udânavarga. It
contains 33 chapters, and more than 1000 verses, of which about
one-fourth only can be traced in the Pâli text. The same collection is
found also in the Tan*g*ur, vol. 71 of the Sûtras, foll. 1-53, followed
by a commentary, the Udânavarga-vivara*n*a by the Â*k*ârya
Pra*gñ*âvarman. Unfortunately Schiefner's intention of publishing a
translation of it (Mélanges Asiatiques, tom. viii. p. 560) has been
frustrated by his death. All that he gives us in his last paper is the
Tibetan text with translation of another shorter collection, the
Gâthâsa<u>n</u>graha by Vasubandhu, equally published in the 72nd volume
of the Sûtras in the Tan*g*ur, and accompanied by a commentary.

SPELLING OF BUDDHIST TERMS.

   I had on a former occasion<sup>\[1\]</sup> pleaded so strongly in
favour of retaining, as much as possible, the original Sanskrit forms of
Pâli Buddhist terms, that I feel bound to confess openly that I hold
this opinion no longer, or, at all events, that I see it is hopeless to
expect that Pâli scholars will accept my proposal. My arguments were
these: 'Most of the technical terms employed by Buddhist writers come
from Sanskrit; and in the eyes of the philologist the various forms
which they have assumed in Pâli, in Burmese, in Tibetan, in Chinese, in
Mongolian, are only so many corruptions of the same original forms.
Everything, therefore, would seem to be in favour of retaining the
Sanskrit forms throughout, and of writing, for instance, Nirvâ*n*a
instead of the Pâli Nibbâna, the Burmese Niban or Nepbhân, the Siamese
Niruphan, the Chinese Nipan. The only hope, in fact, that writers on
Buddhism will ever arrive at a uniform and generally intelligible
phraseology seems to lie in their agreeing to use throughout the
Sanskrit terms in their original form, instead of the various local
disguises and disfigurements which they present in Ceylon, Burmah, Siam,
Tibet, China, and Mongolia.'

   I fully admitted that many Buddhist words have assumed such a
strongly marked local or national character in the different countries
and in the different languages in which the religion of Buddha has found
a new home, that to translate them back into Sanskrit might seem as
affected, nay, prove in certain cases as misleading, as if, in speaking
of priests and kings, we were to speak of presbyters and cynings. The
rule by which I meant mainly to be guided was to use the Sanskrit forms
as much as possible; in fact, everywhere except where it seemed affected
to do so. I therefore wrote Buddhaghosha instead of the Pâli
Buddhaghosa, because the name of that famous theologian, 'the Voice of
Buddha,' seemed to lose its significance if turned

\[1. Introduction to Buddhaghosha's Parables, 1870. p. l.\]

p. liv into Buddhaghosa. But I was well aware what may be said on the
other side. The name of Buddhaghosa, 'Voice of Buddha,' was given him
after he had been converted from Brahmanism to Buddhism, and it was
given to him by people to whom the Pâli word ghosa conveyed the same
meaning as ghosha does to us. On the other hand, I retained the Pâli
Dhammapada instead of Dharmapada, simply because, as the title of a Pâli
book, it has become so familiar that to speak of it as Dharmapada seemed
like speaking of another work. We are accustomed to speak of Samanas
instead of *S*rama*n*as, for even in the days of Alexander's conquest,
the Sanskrit word *S*rama*n*a had assumed the prakritized or vulgar form
which we find in Pâli, and which alone could have been rendered by the
later Greek writers (first by Alexander Polyhistor, 80-60 B.C.) by
{Greek: *samanaioi*}<sup>\[1\]</sup>. As a Buddhist term, the Pâli form
Samana has so entirely supplanted that of *S*rama*n*a that, even in the
Dhammapada (v. 388), we find an etymology of Samana as derived from sam,
'to be quiet,' and not from *s*ram, 'to toil.' But if we speak of
Samanas, we ought also to speak of Bâhma*n*as instead of Brâhma*n*as,
for this word had been replaced by bâhma*n*a at so early a time, that in
the Dhammapada it is derived from a root vah, 'to remove, to separate,
to cleanse<sup>\[2\]</sup>.'

   I still believe that it would be best if writers on Buddhist
literature and religion were to adopt Sanskrit throughout as the lingua
franca. For an accurate understanding of the original meaning of most of
the technical terms of Buddhism a knowledge of their Sanskrit form is
indispensable; and nothing is lost, while much would be gained, if, even
in the treating of southern Buddhism, we were to

\[1. See Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, vol. ii. p. 700, note. That
Lassen is right in taking the {Greek: *Sarmanai*}, mentioned by
Megasthenes, for Brahmanic, not for Buddhist ascetics, might be proved
also by their dress. Dresses made of the bark of trees are not strictly
Buddhistic.

2\. See Dhammapada, v. 388; Bastian. Völker des östlichen Asien, vol
iii. p. 412: 'Ein buddhistischer Mönch erklärte mir, dass die Brahmanen
ihren Namen führten, als Leute, die ihre Sünden abgespült hätten.' See
also Lalita-Vistara, p. 551, line 1; p. 553, line 7.\]

p. lv speak of the town of *S*râvastî instead of Sâvatthi in Pâli, Sevet
in Sinhalese; of Tripi*t*aka, 'the three baskets,' instead of Tipi*t*aka
in Pâli, Tunpitaka in Sinhalese; of Arthakathâ, 'commentary,' instead of
A*tth*akathâ in Pâli, Atuwâva in Sinhalese; and therefore also of
Dharmapada, 'the path of virtue,' instead of Dhammapada.

   But inclinations are stronger than arguments. Pâli scholars prefer
their Pâli terms, and I cannot blame them for it. Mr. D'Alwis (Buddhist
Nirvâ*n*a, p. 68) says: 'It will be seen how very difficult it is to
follow the rule rigidly. We are, therefore, inclined to believe that in
translating Pâli works, at least, much inconvenience may not be felt by
the retention of the forms of the language in which the Buddhist
doctrines were originally delivered.' For the sake of uniformity,
therefore, I have given up my former plan. I use the Pâli forms when I
quote from Pâli, but I still prefer the Sanskrit forms, not only when I
quote from Sanskrit Buddhist books, but also when I have to speak of
Buddhism in general. I speak of Nirvâ*n*a, dharma, and bhikshu, rather
than of Nibbâna, dhamma, and bhikkhu, when discussing the meaning of
these words without special reference to southern Buddhism; but when
treating of the literature and religion of the Theravâda school I must
so far yield to the arguments of Pâli scholars as to admit that it is
but fair to use their language when speaking of their opinions.
