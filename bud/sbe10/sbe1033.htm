<p><hr></p> <h2 align="CENTER">2. DHANIYASUTTA.</h2> <blockquote>A dialogue between the rich herdsman Dhaniya and Buddha, the one rejoicing in his worldly security and the other in his religious belief.--This beautiful dialogue calls to mind the parable in the <a href="../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#12:16">Gospel of S. Luke xii.16</a>.</blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. 'I have boiled (my) rice, I have milked (my cows),'--so said the herdsman Dhaniya,--'I am living together with my fellows near the banks of the Mah&icirc; (river), (my) house is covered, the fire is kindled: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (18)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. 'I am free from anger, free from stubbornness,'--so said Bhagavat,--'I am abiding for one night near the banks of the Mah&icirc; (river), my house</p> 
<p><a>p. 4</a></p> 
<p>is uncovered, the fire (of passions) is extinguished: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (19)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. 'Gad-flies are not to be found (with me),'--so said the herdsman Dhaniya,--'in meadows abounding with grass the cows are roaming, and they can endure rain when it comes: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (20)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. '(By me) is made a well-constructed raft,'--so said Bhagavat,--'I have passed over (to Nibb&acirc;na), I have reached the further bank, having overcome the torrent (of passions); there is no (further) use for a raft: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (21)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. 'My wife is obedient, not wanton,'--so said the herdsman Dhaniya,--'for a long time she has been living together (with me), she is winning, and I hear nothing wicked of her: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (22)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. 'My mind is obedient, delivered (from all worldliness),'--so said Bhagavat,--'it has for a long time been highly cultivated and well-subdued, there is no longer anything wicked in me: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (23)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. 'I support myself by my own earnings,'--so said the herdsman Dhaniya,--'and my children are (all) about me, healthy; I hear nothing wicked of them: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (24)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. 'I am no one's servant,'--so said Bhagavat,--'with what I have gained I wander about in all the world, there is no need (for me) to serve: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (25)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. 'I have cows, I have calves,'-- so said the herdsman Dhaniya;--'I have cows in calf and heifers, and I have also a bull as lord over the cows: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (26)</p> 
<p><a>p. 5</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. 'I have no cows, I have no calves,'--so said Bhagavat,--'I have no cows in calf and no heifers, and I have no bull as a lord over the cows: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky! (27)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. 'The stakes are driven in, and cannot be shaken,'--so said the herdsman Dhaniya,--'the ropes are made of mu<i>&ntilde;g</i>a grass, new and well-made, the cows will not be able to break them: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (28)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>12. 'Having, like a bull, rent the bonds; having, like an elephant, broken through the galu<i>kkh</i>i creeper, I shall not again enter into a womb: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (29)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then at once a shower poured down, filling both sea and land. Hearing the sky raining, Dhaniya spoke thus:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>13. 'No small gain indeed (has accrued) to us since we have seen Bhagavat; we take refuge in thee, O (thou who art) endowed with the eye (of wisdom); be thou our master, O great Muni!' (30)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>14. 'Both my wife and myself are obedient; (if) we lead a holy life before Sugata, we shall conquer birth and death, and put an end to pain.' (31)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>15. 'He who has sons has delight in sons,'--so said the wicked M&acirc;ra,--'he who has cows has delight likewise in cows; for upadhi (substance) is the delight of man, but he who has no upadhi has no delight.' (32)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>16. 'He who has sons has care with (his) sons,'--so said Bhagavat,--'he who has cows has likewise care with (his) cows; for upadhi (is the cause of) people's cares, but he who has no upadhi has no care.' (33)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>13. Surely we ought to praise the good luck of having companions, the best (and such as are our) equals ought to be sought for; not having acquired such friends let one, enjoying (only) allowable things, wander alone like a rhinoceros<sup>[3]</sup>. (46)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>14. Seeing bright golden (bracelets), well-wrought by the goldsmith, striking (against each other when there are) two on one arm, let one wander alone like a rhinoceros. (47)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>16. The sensual pleasures indeed, which are various, sweet, and charming, under their different shapes agitate the mind; seeing the misery (originating) in sensual pleasures, let one wander alone like a rhinoceros. (49)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was heard by me:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time Bhagavat dwelt in Magadha at Dakkhi<i>n</i>&acirc;giri in the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a village Ekana<i>l</i>&acirc;. And at that time the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Kasibh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a's five hundred</p>

<p><a>p. 12</a></p> 
<p>ploughs were tied (to the yokes) in the sowing season. Then Bhagavat, in the morning, having put on his raiment and taken his bowl and robes, went to the place where the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Kasibh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a's work (was going on). At that time the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Kasibh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a's distribution of food took place. Then Bhagavat went to the place where the distribution of food took place, and having gone there, he stood apart. The Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Kasibh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a saw Bhagavat standing there to get alms, and having seen him, he said this to Bhagavat:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I, O Sama<i>n</i>a, both plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, I eat; thou also, O Sama<i>n</i>a, shouldst plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, thou shouldst eat.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I also, O Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a, both plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, I eat,' so said Bhagavat.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yet we do not see the yoke, or the plough, or the ploughshare, or the goad, or the oxen of the venerable Gotama.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the venerable Gotama spoke in this way:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I also, O Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a, both plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, I eat,' so said Bhagavat.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Kasibh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a addressed Bhagavat in a stanza:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. 'Thou professest to be a ploughman, and yet we do not see thy ploughing; asked about (thy) ploughing, tell us (of it), that we may know thy ploughing.' (75)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. Bhagavat answered: 'Faith is the seed, penance the rain, understanding my yoke and plough, modesty the pole of the plough, mind the tie, thoughtfulness my ploughshare and goad. (76)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. 'I am guarded in respect of the body, I am</p> 
<p><a>p. 13</a></p> 
<p>guarded in respect of speech, temperate in food; I make truth to cut away (weeds), tenderness is my deliverance. (77)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. 'Exertion is my beast of burden; carrying (me) to Nibb&acirc;na he goes without turning back to the place where having gone one does not grieve. (78)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. 'So this ploughing is ploughed, it bears the fruit of immortality; having ploughed this ploughing one is freed from all pain.' (79)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Kasibh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a, having poured rice-milk into a golden bowl, offered it to Bhagavat, saying, 'Let the venerable Bhagavat eat of the rice-milk; the venerable is a ploughman, for the venerable Gotama ploughs a ploughing that bears the fruit of immortality.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. Bhagavat said: 'What is acquired by reciting stanzas is not to be eaten by me; this is, O Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a, not the Dhamma of those that see rightly; Buddha rejects what is acquired by reciting stanzas, this is the conduct (of Buddhas) as long as the Dhamma exists.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Kasibh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a alarmed and terrified went up to Bhagavat, and after having approached and fallen with his head at Bhagavat's feet, he said this to Bhagavat:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was heard by me: At one time Bhagavat dwelt at S&acirc;vatth&icirc;, in <i>G</i>etavana, in the park of An&acirc;thapi<i>nd</i>ika. Then Bhagavat having put on his raiment in the morning, and having taken his bowl and his robes, entered S&acirc;vatth&icirc; for alms. Now at that time in the house of the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Aggikabh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a the fire was blazing, the offering brought forth. Then Bhagavat going for alms from house to house in S&acirc;vatth&icirc; went to the house of the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Aggikabh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a. The Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Aggikabh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a saw Bhagavat coming at a distance, and seeing him he said this: 'Stay there, O Shaveling; (stay) there, O Sama<i>n</i>aka (i.e. wretched Sama<i>n</i>a); (stay) there, O Vasalaka (i.e. outcast)!'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This having been said, Bhagavat replied to the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Aggikabh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a: 'Dost thou know, O Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a, an outcast, or the things that make an outcast?'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No, O venerable Gotama, I do not know an outcast, or the things that make an outcast; let the venerable Gotama teach me this so well that I may know an outcast, or the things that make an outcast."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. 'Whosoever, having really contracted a debt, runs away when called upon (to pay), saying, "There is no debt (that I owe) thee," let one know him as an outcast. (119)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. 'Whosoever for love of a trifle having killed a man going along the road, takes the trifle, let one know him as an outcast. (120)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. 'The man who for his own sake or for that of others or for the sake of wealth speaks falsely when asked as a witness, let one know him as an outcast. (121)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. 'Whosoever is seen with the wives of relatives or of friends either by force or with their consent, let one know him as an outcast. (122)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. 'Whosoever strikes or by words annoys mother</p>

<p>or father, brother, sister, or mother-in-law, let one know him as an outcast. (124)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. 'Whosoever, being asked about what is good, teaches what is bad and advises (another, while) concealing (something from him), let one know him as an outcast. (125)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>19. 'Whosoever reviles Buddha or his disciple, be he a wandering mendicant (paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>a) or a householder (gaha<i>tth</i>a), let one know him as an outcast. (133)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>22. 'Know ye this in the way that this example of mine (shows): There was a <i>K</i>a<i>nd</i>&acirc;la of the Sop&acirc;ka caste, well known as M&acirc;ta<u>n</u>ga. (136)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>23. 'This M&acirc;ta<u>n</u>ga reached the highest fame, such as was very difficult to obtain, and many Khattiyas and Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>as went to serve him. (137)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. 'Does he not take what has not been given (to him)?'--so said the Yakkha Hemavata,--'is he self-controlled (in his behaviour) to living beings? is he far from (a state of) carelessness? does he not abandon meditation?' (155)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. 'He does not take what has not been given (to him),'--so said the Yakkha S&acirc;t&acirc;gira,--'and he is self-controlled (in his behaviour) to living beings, and he is far from (a state of) carelessness; Buddha does not abandon meditation.' (156)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. 'Does he not speak falsely?'--so said the Yakkha Hemavata,--'is he not harsh-spoken? does he not utter slander? does he not talk nonsense?' (157)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. 'He does not speak falsely,'--so said the Yakkha S&acirc;t&acirc;gira,--'he is not harsh-spoken, he does not utter slander, with judgment he utters what is good sense.' (158)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. 'Is he not given to sensual pleasures?'--so said the Yakkha Hemavata,--'is his mind undisturbed? has he overcome folly? does he see clearly in (all) things (dhammas)?' (159)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. 'He is not given to sensual pleasures,'--so said the Yakkha S&acirc;t&acirc;gira,--'and his mind is undisturbed;</p> 
<p><a>p. 27</a></p> 
<p>he has overcome all folly; Buddha sees clearly in (all) things.' (160)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. 'Is he endowed with knowledge?'--so said the Yakkha Hemavata,--'is his conduct pure? have his passions been destroyed? is there no new birth (for him)?' (161)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. 'He is endowed with knowledge,'--so said the Yakkha S&acirc;t&acirc;gira,--'and his conduct is pure; all his passions have been destroyed; there is no new birth for him. (162)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>12. 'The mind of the Muni is accomplished in deed and word; Gotama, who is accomplished by his knowledge and conduct, let us (go and) see. (163)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>13. 'Come, let us (go and) see Gotama, who has legs like an antelope, who is thin, who is wise, living on little food, not covetous, the Muni who is meditating in the forest. (164)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>14. 'Having gone to him who is a lion amongst those that wander alone and does not look for sensual pleasures, let us ask about the (means of) deliverance from the snares of death. (165)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>15. 'Let us ask Gotama, the preacher, the expounder, who has penetrated all things, Buddha who has overcome hatred and fear.' (166)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>16. 'In what has the world originated?'--so said the Yakkha Hemavata,--'with what is the world intimate? by what is the world afflicted, after having grasped at what?' (167)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>17. 'In six the world has originated, O Hemavata,'--so said Bhagavat,--'with six it is intimate, by six the world is afflicted, after having grasped at six.' (168)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>18. Hemavata said: 'What is the grasping by</p> 
<p><a>p. 28</a></p> 
<p>which the world is afflicted? Asked about salvation, tell (me) how one is released from pain?' (169)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>19. Bhagavat said: 'Five pleasures of sense are said to be in the world, with (the pleasure of) the mind as the sixth; having divested oneself of desire for these, one is thus released from pain. (170)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>20. 'This salvation of the world has been told to you truly, this I tell you: thus one is released from pain.' (171)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>21. Hemavata said: 'Who in this world crosses the stream (of existence)? who in this world crosses the sea? who does not sink into the deep, where there is no footing and no support?' (172)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>22. Bhagavat said: 'He who is always endowed with virtue, possessed of understanding, well composed, reflecting within himself, and thoughtful, crosses the stream that is difficult to cross. (173)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>23. 'He who is disgusted with sensual pleasures, who has overcome all bonds and destroyed joy, such a one does not sink into the deep.' (174)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>24. Hemavata said: 'He who is endowed with a profound understanding, seeing what is subtile, possessing nothing, not clinging to sensual pleasures, behold him who is in every respect liberated, the great Isi, walking in the divine path. (175)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>25. 'He who has got a great name, sees what is subtile, imparts understanding; and does not cling to the abode of sensual pleasures, behold him, the all-knowing, the wise, the great Isi, walking in the noble path. (176)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>26. 'A good sight indeed (has met) us to-day, a good daybreak, a beautiful rising, (for) we have seen the perfectly enlightened (sambuddham), who has crossed the stream, and is free from passion. (177)</p> 
<p><a>p. 29</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>27. 'These ten hundred Yakkhas, possessed of supernatural power and of fame, they all take refuge in thee, thou art our incomparable Master. (178)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>28. 'We will wander about from village to village, from mountain to mountain, worshipping the perfectly enlightened and the perfection of the Dhamma<sup>[1]</sup>.' (179)</p> 
<p align="CENTER">Hemavatasutta is ended.</p> 
<p><hr></p> <h2 align="CENTER">10. &Acirc;<i>L</i>AVAKASUTTA.</h2> <blockquote>The Yakkha &Acirc;<i>l</i>avaka first threatens Buddha, then puts some questions to him which Buddha answers, whereupon &Acirc;<i>l</i>avaka is converted.</blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was heard by me:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time Bhagavat dwelt at &Acirc;<i>l</i>av&icirc;, in the realm of the Yakkha &Acirc;<i>l</i>avaka. Then the Yakkha &Acirc;<i>l</i>avaka went to the place where Bhagavat dwelt, and having gone there he said this to Bhagavat:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Come out, O Sama<i>n</i>a!'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat came out.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Enter, O Sama<i>n</i>a!'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat entered.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second time the Yakkha &Acirc;<i>l</i>avaka said this to Bhagavat: 'Come out, O Sama<i>n</i>a!'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat came out.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Enter, O Sama<i>n</i>a!'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat entered.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third time the Yakkha &Acirc;<i>l</i>avaka said this Bhagavat: 'Come out, O Sama<i>n</i>a!'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat came out.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Enter, O Sama<i>n</i>a!'</p> 
<p>[1. Dhammassa <i>k</i>a sudhammatam.]</p> 
<p><a>p. 30</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat entered.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fourth time the Yakkha &Acirc;<i>l</i>avaka said this to Bhagavat: 'Come out, O Sama<i>n</i>a!'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I shall not come out to thee, O friend, do what thou pleasest.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I shall ask thee a question, O Sama<i>n</i>a, if thou canst not answer it, I will either scatter thy thoughts or cleave thy heart, or take thee by thy feet and throw thee over to the other shore of the Ga<u>n</u>g&acirc;.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I do not see, O friend, any one in this world nor in the world of gods, M&acirc;ras, Brahmans, amongst the beings comprising gods, men, Sama<i>n</i>as, and Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as, who can either scatter my thoughts or cleave my heart, or take me by the feet and throw me over to the other shore of the Ga<u>n</u>g&acirc;; however, O friend, ask what thou pleasest.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Yakkha &Acirc;<i>l</i>avaka addressed Bhagavat in stanzas:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. 'What in this world is the best property for a man? what, being well done, conveys happiness? what is indeed the sweetest of sweet things? how lived do they call life the best?' (180)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. Bhagavat said: 'Faith is in this world the best property for a man; Dhamma, well observed, conveys happiness; truth indeed is the sweetest of things; and that life they call the best which is lived with understanding.' (181)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. &Acirc;<i>l</i>avaka said: 'How does one cross the stream (of existence)? how does one cross the sea? how does one conquer pain? how is one purified?' (182)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. Bhagavat said: 'By faith one crosses the stream, by zeal the sea, by exertion one conquers pain, by understanding one is purified.' (183)</p> 
<p><a>p. 31</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. &Acirc;<i>l</i>avaka said: 'How does one obtain understanding? how does one acquire wealth? how does one obtain fame? how does one bind friends (to himself)? how does one not grieve passing away from this world to the other?' (184)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. Bhagavat said: 'He who believes in the Dhamma of the venerable ones as to the acquisition of Nibb&acirc;na, will obtain understanding from his desire to hear, being zealous and discerning. (185)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. 'He who does what is proper, who takes the yoke (upon him and) exerts himself, will acquire wealth, by truth he will obtain fame, and being charitable he will bind friends (to himself). (186)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. 'He who is faithful and leads the life of a householder, and possesses the following four Dhammas (virtues), truth, justice (dhamma), firmness, and liberality,--such a one indeed does not grieve when passing away. (187)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. 'Pray, ask also other Sama<i>n</i>as and Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as far and wide, whether there is found in this world anything greater than truth, self-restraint, liberality, and forbearance.' (188)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. &Acirc;<i>l</i>avaka said: 'Why should I now ask Sama<i>n</i>as and Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as far and wide? I now know what is my future good. (189)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. 'For my good Buddha came to live at &Acirc;<i>l</i>av&icirc;; now I know where (i.e. on whom bestowed) a gift will bear great fruit. (190)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>12. 'I will wander about from village to village, from town to town, worshipping the perfectly enlightened (sambuddha) and the perfection of the Dhamma.' (191)</p>

<p><hr></p> <h2 align="CENTER">11. VI<i>G</i>AYASUTTA.</h2> <blockquote>A reflection on the worthlessness of the human body; a follower of Buddha only sees the body as it really is, and consequently goes to Nibb&acirc;na.--Comp. <i>G</i>&acirc;taka I, p. 146.</blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. If either walking or standing, sitting or lying, any one contracts (or) stretches (his body, then) this is the motion of the body. (192)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. The body which is put together with bones and sinews, plastered with membrane and flesh, and covered with skin, is not seen as it really is. (193)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. It is filled with the intestines, the stomach, the lump of the liver, the abdomen, the heart, the lungs, the kidneys, the spleen. (194)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. With mucus, saliva, perspiration, lymph, blood, the fluid that lubricates the joints, bile, and fat. (195)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. Then in nine streams impurity flows always from it; from the eye the eye-excrement, from the ear the ear-excrement, (196)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. Mucus from the nose, through the mouth it ejects at one time bile and (at other times) it ejects phlegm, and from (all) the body come sweat and dirt. (197)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. Then its hollow head is filled with the brain. A fool led by ignorance thinks it a fine thing. (198)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. And when it lies dead, swollen and livid, discarded in the cemetery, relatives do not care (for it). (199)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. Dogs eat it and jackals, wolves and worms; crows and vultures eat it, and what other living creatures there are. (200)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. The Bhikkhu possessed of understanding in this world, having listened to Buddha's words, he</p> 
<p><a>p. 33</a></p> 
<p>certainly knows it (i.e. the body) thoroughly, for he sees it as it really is. (201)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. "As this (living body is) so is that (dead one), as this is so that (will be<sup>[1]</sup>); let one put away desire for the body, both as to its interior and as to its exterior." (202)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>12. Such a Bhikkhu who has turned away from desire and attachment, and is possessed of understanding in this world, has (already) gone to the immortal peace, the unchangeable state of Nibb&acirc;na. (203)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>13. This (body) with two feet is cherished (although) impure, ill-smelling, filled with various kinds of stench, and trickling here and there. (204)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>14. He who with such a body thinks to exalt himself or despises others--what else (is this) but blindness? (205)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. From acquaintanceship arises fear, from house-life arises defilement; the houseless state, freedom from acquaintanceship--this is indeed the view of a Muni. (206)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. Whosoever, after cutting down the (sin that has) arisen, does not let (it again) take root and does not give way to it while springing up towards him, him</p>

<p>the solitarily wandering they call a Muni; such a great Isi has seen the state of peace<sup>[1]</sup>. (207)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. Having considered the causes (of sin, and) killed the seed, let him not give way to desire for it; such a Muni who sees the end of birth and destruction (i.e. Nibb&acirc;<i>n</i>a), after leaving reasoning behind, does not enter the number (of living beings)<sup>[2]</sup>. (208)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. He who has penetrated all the resting-places<sup>[3]</sup> (of the mind, and) does not wish for any of them,--such a Muni indeed, free from covetousness and free from greediness, does not gather up (resting-places), for he has reached the other shore. (209)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. The man who has overcome everything, who knows everything, who is possessed of a good understanding, undefiled in all things (dhamma), abandoning everything, liberated in the destruction of desire (i.e. Nibb&acirc;<i>n</i>a), him the wise style a Muni<sup>[4]</sup>. (210)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. The man who has the strength of understanding, is endowed with virtue and (holy) works, is composed, delights in meditation, is thoughtful, free from ties, free from harshness (akhila), and free from passion, him the wise style a Muni. (211)</p>

<p>that is not shaken by blame and praise, like a lion not trembling at noises, like the wind not caught in a net, like a lotus not soiled by water, leading others, not led by others, him the wise style a Muni. (212)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. Whosoever becomes firm as the post in a bathing-place, in whom others acknowledge propriety of speech, who is free from passion, and (endowed) with well-composed senses, such a one the wise style a Muni. (213)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. Whosoever is firm, like a straight shuttle, and is disgusted with evil actions, reflecting on what is just and unjust, him the wise style a Muni. (214)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. Whosoever is self-restrained and does not do evil, is a young or middle-aged Muni, self-subdued, one that should not be provoked (as) he does not provoke any, him the wise style a Muni. (215)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. Whosoever, living upon what is given by others, receives a lump of rice from the top, from the middle or from the rest (of the vessel, and) does not praise (the giver) nor speak harsh words, him the wise style a Muni. (216)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>12. The Muni that wanders about abstaining from sexual intercourse, who in his youth is not fettered in any case, is abstaining from the insanity of pride, liberated, him the wise style a Muni. (217)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>13. The man who, having penetrated the world, sees the highest truth, such a one, after crossing the stream and sea (of existence), who has cut off all ties, is independent, free from passion, him indeed the wise style a Muni. (218)</p>

<p>other living creatures, being unrestrained; but a Muni always protects living creatures, being restrained. (219)</p>
