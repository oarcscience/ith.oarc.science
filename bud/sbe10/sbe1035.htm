<p><hr></p> <h2 align="CENTER">1. PABBA<i>GG</i>&Acirc;SUTTA.</h2> <blockquote>King Bimbis&acirc;ra feeling interested in Buddha tries to tempt him with wealth, but is mildly rebuked by Buddha.</blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. I will praise an ascetic life such as the clearly-seeing (Buddha) led, such as he thinking (over it) approved of as an ascetic life. (404)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. ' This house-life is pain, the seat of impurity,' and 'an ascetic life is an open-air life,' so considering he embraced an ascetic life. (405)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. Leading an ascetic life, he avoided with his body sinful deeds, and having (also) abandoned sin in words, he cleansed his life. (406)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. Buddha went to R&acirc;<i>g</i>agaha, he entered the Giribba<i>g</i>a in Magadha for alms with a profusion of excellent signs. (407)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. Bimbis&acirc;ra standing in his palace saw him, and seeing him endowed with these signs, he spoke these words: (408)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. 'Attend ye to this man, he is handsome, great, clean, he is both endowed with good conduct, and he does not look before him further than a yuga (the distance of a plough). (409)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. 'With downcast eyes, thoughtful, this one is not like those of low caste; let the king's messengers run off, (and ask): "Where is the Bhikkhu going?"' (410)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. The king's messengers followed after (him, and</p> 
<p><a>p. 68</a></p> 
<p>said): 'Where is the Bhikkhu going, where will he reside? (411)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. 'Going begging from house to house, watching the door (of the senses), well restrained, he quickly filled his bowl, conscious, thoughtful. (412)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. 'Wandering about in search of alms, having gone out of town, the Muni repaired to (the mountain) Pa<i>nd</i>ava; it must be there he lives.' (413)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. Seeing that he had entered his dwelling, the messengers then sat down, and one messenger having returned announced it to the king. (414)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>12. 'This Bhikkhu, O great king, is sitting on the east side of Pa<i>nd</i>ava, like a tiger, like a bull, like a lion in a mountain cave.' (415)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>13. Having heard the messenger's words, the Khattiya in a fine chariot hastening went out to the Pa<i>nd</i>ava mountain. (416)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>14. Having gone as far as the ground was practicable for a chariot, the Khattiya, after alighting from the chariot, and approaching on foot, having come up (to him), seated himself. (417)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>15. Having sat down the king then exchanged the usual ceremonious greetings with him, and after the complimentary talk he spoke these words: (418)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>16. 'Thou art both young and delicate, a lad in his first youth, possessed of a fine complexion, like a high-born Khattiya. (419)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>17. 'I will ornament the army-house, and at the head of the assembly of chiefs (n&acirc;ga) give (thee) wealth; enjoy it and tell me thy birth, when asked.' (420)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>18. Buddha: 'Just beside Himavanta, O king, there lives a people endowed with the power of wealth, the inhabitants of Kosala. (421)</p> 
<p><a>p. 69</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>19. 'They are &Acirc;di<i>kk</i>as by family, S&acirc;kiyas by birth; from that family I have wandered out, not longing for sensual pleasures. (422)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>20. 'Seeing misery in sensual pleasures, and considering the forsaking of the world as happiness, I will go and exert myself; in this my mind delights.' (423)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. To me, whose mind was intent upon exertion near the river Nera<i>&ntilde;g</i>ar&acirc;, having exerted myself, and given myself to meditation for the sake of acquiring Nibb&acirc;na (yogakkhema), (424)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. Came Namu<i>k</i>i speaking words full of compassion: 'Thou art lean, ill-favoured, death is in thy neighbourhood. (425)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. 'A thousandth part of thee (is the property) of death, (only) one part (belongs to) life; living life, O thou venerable one, is better; living thou wilt be able to do good works<sup>[1]</sup>. (426)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. 'When thou livest a religious life, and feedest the sacrificial fire, manifold good works are woven to thee; what dost thou want with exertion? (427)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. 'Difficult is the way of exertion, difficult to pass, difficult to enter upon;' saying these verses M&acirc;ra stood near Buddha. (428)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. To M&acirc;ra thus speaking Bhagavat said this: 'O thou friend of the indolent, thou wicked one, for what purpose hast thou come here? (429)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. 'Even the least good work is of no use to me; and what good works are required, M&acirc;ra ought to tell. (430)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. 'I have faith and power, and understanding is found in me; while thus exerting myself, why do you ask me to live<sup>[1]</sup>? (431)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. 'This (burning) wind will dry up even the currents of the rivers; should it not by degrees dry up my blood, while I am exerting myself? (432)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. 'While the blood is drying up, the bile and the phlegm are dried up; while the flesh is wasting away, the mind gets more tranquil, and my attention, understanding, and meditation get more steadfast<sup>[2]</sup>. (433)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. 'While I am living thus, after having felt the extreme sensations, my mind does not look for sensual pleasures; behold a being's purity. (434)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was heard by me:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time Bhagavat dwelt at S&acirc;vatth&icirc; in <i>G</i>etavana. Bhagavat said this: 'O Bhikkhus, the speech that is provided with four requisites is well-spoken, not ill-spoken, both faultless and blameless to the wise.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Which four?'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'O Bhikkhus, the Bhikkhu speaks well-spoken (language), not ill-spoken; he speaks what is right (dhamma), not what is unrighteous (adhamma); he speaks what is pleasing, not what is unpleasing; he speaks what is true, not what is false. O Bhikkhus, the speech that is provided with these four requisites, is well-spoken, not ill-spoken, both faultless</p>

<p><a>p. 73</a></p> 
<p>and blameless to the wise.' This said Bhagavat. When Sugata had said this, then the Master spoke the following:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. 'Well-spoken language the just call the principal (thing); let one speak what is right (dhamma), not what is unrighteous (adhamma), that is the second; let one speak what is pleasing, not what is unpleasing, that is the third; let one speak what is true, not what is false, that is the fourth.' (449)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the venerable Va<u>n</u>g&icirc;sa, rising from his seat, throwing his robe over one shoulder and bending his joined hands towards Bhagavat, said this: 'It occurs to me, O Sugata!'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let it occur to thee, O Va<u>n</u>g&icirc;sa!' said Bhagavat.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the venerable Va<u>n</u>g&icirc;sa, standing before Bhagavat, praised him with appropriate stanzas:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. 'Let one say such words by which he does not pain himself, nor hurt others; such words are truly well-spoken. (450)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. 'Let one speak pleasing words which are received joyfully (by all), and which (saying) he, without committing sins, speaks what is pleasing to others. (451)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. 'Truth verily is immortal speech, this is a true saying; in what is true, in what is good, and in what is right, the just stand firm, so they say. (452)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. 'The words which Buddha speaks, which are sure to bring about extinction and put an end to pain, such (words) are truly the best.' (453)</p>

<p><hr></p> <h2 align="CENTER">4. SUNDARIKABH&Acirc;RADV&Acirc;<i>G</i>ASUTTA.</h2> <blockquote>Buddha shows to Sundarikabh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a on whom to bestow oblations, and the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a is finally converted.</blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was heard by me:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time Bhagavat dwelt in Kosala on the bank of the river Sundarik&acirc;. And during that time the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Sundarikabh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a made offerings to the fire and worshipped the fire. Then the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Sundarikabh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a, having made offerings to the fire and worshipped the fire, and having risen from his seat, looked about him on all sides towards the four quarters of the globe, saying: 'Who is to enjoy the rest of this oblation?' The Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Sundarikabh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a saw Bhagavat sitting not far off at the root of a tree, wrapped up head and body; and seeing him he, after taking the rest of the oblation with his left hand and the waterpot with his right hand, went up to Bhagavat. Then Bhagavat, on hearing the footsteps of Sundarikabh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a, the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a, uncovered his head. Then the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a Sundarikabh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a thought: 'This man is shaved, this man is a shaveling,' and he wished to return again from there. Then this came to the mind of Sundarikabh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a, the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a: 'Some Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>as also here are shaved, I think I shall go up and ask him about his descent.' Then the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a Sundarikabh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a went up to Bhagavat, and having gone up he said this: 'Of what family art thou?'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Bhagavat answered Sundarikabh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a, the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a, in stanzas:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. 'No Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a am I, nor a king's son, nor any</p> 
<p><a>p. 75</a></p> 
<p>Vessa; having thoroughly observed the class of common people, I wander about the world reflectingly, possessing nothing. (454)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. 'Dressed in a sangh&acirc;<i>t</i>i<sup>[1]</sup> and houseless I wander about, with my hair cut off, calm, not intermixing with people in this world. Thou askest me an unseasonable question about (my) family, O Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a!' (455)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Sundarikabh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a: 'Sir, Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>as together with Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>as ask truly, Art thou a Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a?'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>Bhagavat: 'If thou sayest, I am a Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a, and callest me no Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a, then I ask thee about the S&acirc;vitti that consists of three padas and twenty-four syllables<sup>[2]</sup>.' (456)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Sundarikabh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a: 'For what (reason) did the Isis, men, Khattiyas, Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>as make offerings to the gods abundantly in this world?'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>Bhagavat: 'He who, perfect and accomplished at the time of offering, obtains the ear of one or the other (god), he will succeed, so I say.' (457)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. 'Surely his offering will bear fruit,'--so said the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a,--'because we saw such an accomplished man; for by not seeing such as you, somebody else will enjoy the oblation.' (458)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. Bhagavat: 'Therefore, O Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a, as you have come here to ask for something, ask; perhaps thou mightest here find one that is calm, without anger, free from pain, free from desire, one with a good understanding.' (459)</p>

<p><a>p. 76</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. Sundarikabh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a: 'I delight in offering, O Gotama, I desire to make an offering, but I do not understand it; do thou instruct me, tell me in what case the offering succeeds.' (460)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. Bhagavat: 'Therefore, O Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a, lend me thy ear, I will teach thee the Dhamma. (461)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. 'Do not ask about descent, but ask about conduct; from wood, it is true, fire is born; (likewise) a firm Muni, although belonging to a low family, may become noble, when restrained (from sinning) by humility. (462)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. 'He who is subdued by truth, endowed with temperance, accomplished, leading a religious life, on such a one in due time people should bestow oblations; let the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a who has good works in view, offer. (463)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. 'Those who, after leaving sensual pleasures, wander about houseless, well restrained, being like a straight shuttle, on such in due time people should bestow oblations; let the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a who has good works in view, offer. (464)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>12. 'Those whose passions are gone, whose senses are well composed, who are liberated like the moon out of the grasp of R&acirc;hu, on such in due time people should bestow oblations; let the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a who has good works in view, offer. (465)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>13. 'Those who wander about in the world without clinging (to anything), always thoughtful, having left selfishness, on such in due time people should bestow oblations; let the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a who has good works in view, offer. (466)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>19. 'He whose passion for existence and whose harsh talk are destroyed, are perished, (and therefore) exist not, he the accomplished and in every respect liberated Tath&acirc;gata deserves the oblation. (472)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was heard by me:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time Bhagavat dwelt at R&acirc;<i>g</i>agaha, in the mountain (called) the Vulture's Peak (Gi<i>ggh</i>ak&ucirc;<i>t</i>a).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the young man M&acirc;gha went to Bhagavat, and having gone to him he talked pleasantly with him, and after having had some pleasant, remarkable conversation with him he sat down apart; sitting down apart the young man M&acirc;gha spoke this to Bhagavat:</p> 
<p><a>p. 81</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'O venerable Gotama, I am a liberal giver, bountiful, suitable to beg of; justly I seek for riches, and having sought for riches justly, I give out of the justly obtained and justly acquired riches to one, to two, to three, to four, to five, to six, to seven, to eight, to nine, to ten, to twenty, to thirty, to forty, to fifty, to a hundred, I give still more. (I should like to know), O venerable Gotama, whether I, while so giving, so offering, produce much good.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Certainly, O young man, dost thou in so offering produce much good; he, O young man, who is a liberal giver, bountiful, suitable to beg of, and who justly seeks for riches, and having sought for riches justly, gives out of his justly obtained and justly acquired riches to one, to two, to three, to four, to five, to six, to seven, to eight, to nine, to ten, to twenty, to thirty, to forty, to fifty, to a hundred, and gives still more, produces much good.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the young man M&acirc;gha addressed Bhagavat in stanzas:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. 'I ask the venerable Gotama, the bountiful,'--so said the young man M&acirc;gha,--'wearing the yellow robe, wandering about houseless:' 'He who is a householder, suitable to beg of, a donor, who, desirous of good, offers having what is good in view, and giving to others in this world food and drink,--where (i.e. on whom bestowed) will the oblation of such an offerer prosper?' (487)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. 'He who is a householder, suitable to beg of, a donor, O M&acirc;gha,'--so said Bhagavat,--'who, desirous of good, offers having what is good in view, and giving to others in this world food and drink, such a one will prosper with those worthy of offerings.' (488)</p> 
<p><a>p. 82</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. 'He who is a householder, suitable to beg of, a donor,'--so said the young man,--'who, desirous of good, offers having what is good in view, and giving to others in this world food and drink,--tell me (I being such a one), O Bhagavat, of those worthy of offerings.' (489)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. Bhagavat: 'Those indeed who wander about in the world without clinging to anything and without possessing anything, perfect, self-restrained, on such in due time people should bestow oblations; let the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a who has good (works) in view, offer. (490)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. 'Those who have cut through all bonds and fetters, who are subdued, liberated, free from pain, and free from desire, on such in due time people should bestow oblations; let the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a who has good (works) in view, offer. (491)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. 'Those who are released from all bonds, who are subdued, liberated, free from pain, and free from desire on such in due time people should bestow oblations; let the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a who has good (works) in view, offer. (492)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. 'Those who, having forsaken both passion and hatred and folly, have destroyed their desires and lead a religious life, on such in due time people should bestow oblations; let the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a who has good (works) in view, offer<sup>[1]</sup>. (493)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. 'Those in whom there lives no deceit, no arrogance, who are free from cupidity, free from selfishness, free from desire, on such in due time people should bestew oblations; let the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a who has good (works) in view, offer. (494)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. 'Those indeed who without being lost in desire,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. 'Those who, after leaving sensual pleasures, wander about houseless, well restrained, being like a straight shuttle, on such in due time people should bestow oblations; let the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a who has good (works) in view, offer. (497)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>12. 'Those whose passions are gone, whose senses are well composed, who are liberated like the moon out of the grasp of R&acirc;hu, on such in due time people should bestow oblations; let the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a who has good (works) in view, offer. (498)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>13. 'Those who are calm, whose passions are gone, who are without anger, and for whom there is no transmigration after having left here, on such in due time people should bestow oblations; let the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a who has good (works) in view, offer. (499)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>14. 'Those who, after leaving birth and death altogether, have conquered all doubt, on such in due time people should bestow oblations; let the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a who has good (works) in view, offer. (500)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>15. 'Those who wander about in the world with themselves for a light, not possessed of anything, in every respect liberated, on such in due time people should bestow oblations; let the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a who has good (works) in view, offer. (501)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>18. 'Certainly my question was not in vain, Bhagavat has told me of those worthy of offerings; for thou truly knowest this in this world, as surely to thee this Dhamma is known. (504)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>19. 'He who is a householder, suitable to beg of, a donor,'--so said the young man M&acirc;gha,--'who, desirous of good, offers having what is good in view, and giving to others in this world food and drink,--tell me (I being such a one), O Bhagavat, of the blessing of offering.' (505)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>20. 'Offer, O M&acirc;gha,'--so said Bhagavat,--'and while offering make calm thy mind in all things; the object of the one that offers is the oblation, standing fast in this he leaves hatred behind. (506)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>21. 'Such a one whose passion is gone will repress hatred, cultivating an unbounded friendly mind; continually strenuous night and day he will spread infinite goodness through all regions.' (507)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>22. M&acirc;gha: 'Who prospers? who is liberated and who is bound? In which way can one by himself go to Brahmaloka? Tell this to me who does not know, O Muni, when asked. Bhagavat is indeed my witness that Brahman is seen by me to-day, for thou art to us equal to Brahman, this is the truth; how can one attain Brahmaloka, O thou glorious one?' (508)</p> 
<p><a>p. 85</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>23. 'He who offers the threefold blessing of oblation, O M&acirc;gha,'--so said Bhagavat,--'such a one will prosper with those worthy of offerings; so, having offered properly, he who is suitable to beg of attains Brahmaloka, so I say.' (509)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This having been said, M&acirc;gha the young man spoke as follows to Bhagavat: 'Excellent, O venerable Gotama! Excellent, O venerable Gotama! As one raises what has been overthrown, or reveals what has been hidden, or tells the way to him who has gone astray, or holds out an oil lamp in the dark that those who have eyes may see the objects, even so by the venerable Gotama in manifold ways the Dhamma has been illustrated; I take refuge in the venerable Gotama and in the Dhamma and in the Assembly of Bhikkhus. Let the venerable Gotama accept me as an up&acirc;saka (a follower, me), who henceforth for all my life have taken refuge (in him).'</p>

SABHIYASUTTA.</h2> <blockquote>Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka, goes to the six famous teachers of his time to have his questions answered, but not having his doubts solved, he repairs to Gotama and asks him how one is to behave to become a Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a, a Sama<i>n</i>a, a Nah&acirc;taka, a Khetta<i>g</i>ina, a Kusala, a Pa<i>nd</i>ita, a Muni, a Vedag&ucirc;, an Anuvidita, a Dh&icirc;ra, an &Acirc;<i>g</i>&acirc;niya, a Sottiya, an Ariya, a <i>K</i>ara<i>n</i>avat, a Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka. Bhagavat answers his questions, and Sabhiya finally receives the robe and the orders from Buddha.</blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was heard by me:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time Bhagavat dwelt at R&acirc;<i>g</i>agaha, in Ve<i>l</i>uvana, in Kalandakaniv&acirc;pa. And at that time questions were recited to Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka</p> 
<p><a>p. 86</a></p> 
<p>(wandering mendicant), by an old benevolent deity: 'He who, O Sabhiya, be it a Sama<i>n</i>a or a Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a, explains these questions to thee when asked, near him thou shouldst live a religious life.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka, having learnt the questions from that deity, went to whatever Sama<i>n</i>as and Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>as there were that had an assembly (of Bhikkhus), a crowd (of followers), and were well-known teachers, famous leaders, considered excellent by the multitude, as P&ucirc;ra<i>n</i>a-Kassapa, Makkhali-Gos&acirc;la, A<i>g</i>ita-Kesakambali, Pakudha-Ka<i>kk</i>&acirc;yana, Sa<i>&ntilde;g</i>aya-Bela<i>tth</i>iputta, and Niga<i>nth</i>a-N&acirc;taputta. Those he went to, and after going to them, he asked the questions. They, being asked the questions by Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka, did not succeed (in answering them), and not succeeding, they showed wrath and hatred and discontent, and they also in return put questions to Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then this came to the mind of Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka: 'Whatever Sama<i>n</i>as and Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>as there are that have an assembly (of Bhikkhus), a crowd (of followers), and are well-known teachers, famous leaders, considered excellent by the multitude, as P&ucirc;ra<i>n</i>a-Kassapa, Makkhali-Gos&acirc;la, A<i>g</i>ita-Kesakambali, Pakudha-Ka<i>kk</i>&acirc;yana, Sa<i>&ntilde;g</i>aya-Bela<i>tth</i>iputta, and Niga<i>nth</i>a-N&acirc;taputta, they, being asked questions by me, did not succeed (in answering them), and not succeeding they showed wrath and hatred and discontent, and they also in return put questions to me in this matter; surely I think I shall go back to what I have left, and enjoy sensual pleasures.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then this came to the mind of Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka: 'This Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama has both an</p> 
<p><a>p. 87</a></p> 
<p>assembly (of Bhikkhus) and a crowd (of followers), and is a well-known teacher, a famous leader, considered excellent by the multitude, surely I think I shall go to Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama and ask these questions.' Then this came to the mind of Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka: 'Whatever Sama<i>n</i>as and Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as there are that are decayed, old, aged, advanced in years, having reached old age, experienced elders, long ordained, having assemblies (of Bhikkhus), crowds (of followers), being teachers well-known, famous leaders, considered excellent by the multitude, as P&ucirc;ra<i>n</i>a-Kassapa, Makkhali-Gos&acirc;la, A<i>g</i>ita-Kesakambali, Pakudha-Ka<i>kk</i>&acirc;yana, Sa<i>&ntilde;g</i>aya-Bela<i>tth</i>iputta, and Niga<i>nth</i>a-N&acirc;taputta, they, being asked questions by me, did not succeed (in answering them), and not succeeding they showed wrath and hatred and discontent, and they also in return put questions to me in this matter; (I should like to know) whether Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama being asked these questions will be able to explain them to me, for Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama is both young by birth and new in ascetic life.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then this came to the mind of Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka: 'Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama is not to be slighted because he is young; even if the Sama<i>n</i>a is young, yet he is mighty and powerful; surely I think I shall go to Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama and ask these questions.' Then Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka, went on a journey to R&acirc;<i>g</i>agaha, and wandering on his journey in regular order he came to R&acirc;<i>g</i>agaha, Ve<i>l</i>uvana, Kalandakaniv&acirc;pa, to Bhagavat, and having come to Bhagavat he talked pleasantly with him, and after having had some pleasant and remarkable conversation with him he sat down apart; sitting down apart</p> 
<p><a>p. 88</a></p> 
<p>Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka, spoke to Bhagavat in stanzas:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. 'Anxious and doubtful I have come,'--so said Sabhiya,--'longing to ask questions. Do thou put an end to these (doubts when) asked these questions by me, in regular order, and rightly explain them to me.' (510)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. 'Thou hast come from afar, O Sabhiya,'--so said Bhagavat,--'longing to ask questions; I shall put an end to those (doubts when) asked those questions by thee, in regular order, and rightly I shall explain them to thee. (511)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. 'Ask me, O Sabhiya, a question; whatsoever thou wishest in thy mind that question I (will explain, and) put an end to (thy doubt).' (512)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then this came to the mind of Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka: 'It is marvellous, it is wonderful indeed, the reception which I did not get from other Sama<i>n</i>as and Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as has been given me by Gotama,' so saying he glad, rejoicing, delighted, and highly elated asked Bhagavat a question:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. 'What should a man (necessarily) have obtained that people may call him a Bhikkhu?'--so said Sabhiya,--'how may they call him compassionate, and how subdued? how can he be called enlightened (buddha)? Asked (about this) do thou, Bhagavat, explain it to me.' (513)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. 'He who by the path he has himself made, O Sabhiya,'--so said Bhagavat,--'has attained to perfect happiness, who has conquered doubt, who lives after having left behind both gain and goods, who has destroyed re-birth, he is a Bhikkhu. (514)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. 'Always resigned and attentive, he will not hurt any one in all the world, the Sama<i>n</i>a who has</p> 
<p><a>p. 89</a></p> 
<p>crossed the stream (of existence, and is) untroubled; for whom there are no desires (ussada), he is compassionate. (515)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. 'He whose senses are trained internally and externally in all the world, he who after penetrating this and the other world longs for death, being trained, he is subdued. (516)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. 'Whosoever, after having considered all times (kappa), the revolution (sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra), both the vanishing and re-appearance (of beings), is free from defilement, free from sin, is pure, and has obtained destruction of birth, him they call enlightened (buddha).' (517)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka, having approved of and rejoiced at the words of Bhagavat, glad, rejoicing, delighted, highly elated, asked Bhagavat another question:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. 'What should a man (necessarily) have obtained that people may call him a Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a?'--so said Sabhiya,--'and how (may they call him) a Sama<i>n</i>a? and how a Nah&acirc;taka? how can he be called a N&acirc;ga? Asked (about this) do thou Bhagavat explain it to me.' (518)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. 'He who, after removing all sins, O Sabhiya,'--so said Bhagavat,--'is immaculate, well composed, firm-minded, perfect after crossing the Sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra, such an independent one is called a Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a. (519)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. 'He who is calm, having left behind good and evil, free from defilement, having understood this and the other world, and conquered birth and death, such a one is called a Sama<i>n</i>a by being so<sup>[1]</sup>.' (520)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>12. 'Whosoever, after having washed away all sins internally and externally in all the world, does</p>

<p>not enter time (kappa) amongst gods and men who are subject to time, him they call a Nah&acirc;taka (cleansed)<sup>[1]</sup>. (521)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>13. 'He who does not commit any crime in the world, who, after abandoning all bonds and fetters, clings to nothing, being liberated, such a one is called a N&acirc;ga (sinless) by being so<sup>[2]</sup>.' (522)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka, having approved of and rejoiced at the words of Bhagavat, glad, rejoicing, delighted, highly elated, further asked Bhagavat a question:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>14. 'Whom do the Buddhas call a Khetta<i>g</i>ina?'--so said Sabhiya,--'how (can they call any one) a Kusala? and how a Pa<i>nd</i>ita? how can he be called a Muni? Asked (about this) do thou Bhagavat explain it to me.' (523)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>15. 'He who, after examining all regions, O Sabhiya,'--so said Bhagavat,--'the divine and the human, and Brahman's region, is delivered from the radical bond of all regions, such a one is called a Khetta<i>g</i>ina (he who has conquered the regions) by being so. (524)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>16. 'He who, after examining all treasures, the divine and the human, and Brahman's treasure, is delivered from the radical bond of all treasures, such a one is called a Kusala (happy) by being so. (525)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka, having approved of and rejoiced at the words of Bhagavat, glad, rejoicing, delighted, highly elated, further asked Bhagavat a question:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>19. 'What should one (necessarily) have obtained that people may call him Vedag&ucirc;?'--so said Sabhiya,--'and how (may they call him) Anuvidita? and how Viriyavat? How does one become &Acirc;<i>g</i>&acirc;niya? Asked (about this) do thou, O Bhagavat, explain it to me.' (528)</p>

'He who, having conquered all sensations, O Sabhiya,'--so said Bhagavat,--'which are (known) to Sama<i>n</i>as and to Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>as, is free from passion for all sensations, he is Vedag&ucirc; (having passed sensation) after conquering all sensation. (529)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>21. 'He who, having seen the delusion of name and form<sup>[1]</sup>, internally and externally, the root of sickness, and is delivered from the radical bond of all sickness, such a one is called Anuvidita (well-informed) by being so. (530)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>22. 'He who is disgusted in this world with all sins, is strong after conquering the pain of hell, is strong and powerful, such a one is called Dh&icirc;ra ( = viriyavat, firm) by being so. (531)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>23. 'He whose bonds are cut off internally and externally, the root of ties<sup>[1]</sup>, who is delivered from the radical bond of all ties, such a one is called &Acirc;<i>g</i>&acirc;niya (high-bred) by being so.' (532)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka, having approved of and rejoiced at the words of Bhagavat, glad, rejoicing, delighted, highly elated, further asked Bhagavat a question:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>24. 'What should a man (necessarily) have obtained that people may call him a Sottiya?'--so said Sabhiya,--'how (may they call him) an Ariya? and how a <i>K</i>ara<i>n</i>avat? how may he become a Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka? Asked (about this) do thou, O Bhagavat, explain it to me.' (533)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>25. 'Whosoever, after having heard and understood every Dhamma in the world, O Sabhiya,'--so said Bhagavat,--'whatsoever is wrong and whatsoever is blameless, is victorious, free from doubt, liberated, free from pain in every respect, him they call a Sottiya (learned in the revelation). (534)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>26. 'Whosoever, after having cut off passions and desires, is wise and does not (again) enter the womb, having driven away the threefold sign, the mud (of lust), and who does not (again) enter time (kappa), him they call an Ariya (noble). (535)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>27. 'He who in this world, after having attained the (highest) gain in the <i>K</i>ara<i>n</i>as, is skilful, has always understood the Dhamma, clings to nothing, is liberated, and for whom there are no passions, he is a <i>K</i>ara<i>n</i>avat (endowed with the obsrvances). (536)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>28. 'Whosoever abstains from the action that has a painful result, above and below and across and in</p>

<p>the middle, who wanders with understanding, who has put an end to deceit, arrogance, cupidity and anger, name and form, him they call a Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka (a wandering mendicant) who has attained the (highest) gain.' (537)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka, having approved of and rejoiced at the words of Bhagavat, glad, rejoicing, delighted, highly elated, having risen from his seat, and having put his upper robe upon one shoulder, bending his joined hands towards Bhagavat, praised Bhagavat face to face in appropriate stanzas:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>29. 'Having conquered the three and sixty (philosophical) views referring to the disputations of the Sama<i>n</i>as, thou hast crossed over the darkness of the stream<sup>[1]</sup>. (?) (538)</p>

'Thou hast passed to the end of and beyond pain, thou art a saint, perfectly enlightened, I consider thee one that has destroyed his passions, thou art glorious, thoughtful, of great understanding, O thou who puts an end to pain, thou hast carried me across.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>32. 'The doubt I had before thou hast cleared away for me, O thou clearly-seeing; surely thou art a Muni, perfectly enlightened, there is no obstacle for thee. (541)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>33. 'And all thy troubles are scattered and cut off, thou art calm, subdued, firm, truthful. (542)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>34. 'All gods and both N&acirc;rada and Pabbata rejoice at thee, the chief of the sinless (n&acirc;gan&acirc;ga), the great hero, when thou art speaking. (543)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>35. 'Adoration be to thee, O noble man, adoration be to thee, O thou best of men; in the world of men and gods there is no man equal to thee. (544)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>36. 'Thou art Buddha, thou art the Master, thou art the Muni that conquers M&acirc;ra; after having cut off desire thou hast crossed over and hast carried across this generation. (545)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka, stooping with his head to Bhagavat's feet, said this to Bhagavat:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is excellent, O venerable! It is excellent, O venerable! As one raises what has been overthrown, or reveals what has been hidden, or tells the way to him who has gone astray, or holds out an oil lamp in the dark that those who have eyes may see the objects, even so by the venerable Gotama in manifold ways the Dhamma has been illustrated; I take refuge in the venerable Gotama, in the Dhamma, and in the Assembly of Bhikkhus; I wish to receive the robe and the orders from the venerable Bhagavat.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He who, O Sabhiya, formerly belonging</p> 
<p><a>p. 95</a></p> 
<p>another creed (a<i>&ntilde;&ntilde;</i>atitthiyapubba), wishes to be adopted into this religion (dhammavinaya), and wishes to receive the robe and the orders, he serves for four months; after the lapse of four months Bhikkhus who have appeased their thoughts will give him the robe and the orders to become a Bhikkhu, (for) I also in this matter acknowledge difference of persons.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If, O venerable, those that formerly belonged to another creed and wish to be adopted into this religion and to receive the robe and the orders, serve for four months, and after the lapse of four months Bhikkhus who have appeased their thoughts give them the robe and the orders that they may become Bhikkhus, I will (also) serve for four months, and after the lapse of four months Bhikkhus who have appeased their thoughts shall give (me) the robe and the orders that I may become a Bhikkhu.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabhiya, the Paribb&acirc;<i>g</i>aka, received the robe and the orders from Bhagavat, and the venerable Sabhiya, having lately received the upasampad&acirc;, leading a solitary, retired, strenuous, ardent, energetic life, lived after having in a short time in this existence by his own understanding ascertained and possessed himself of that highest perfection of a religious life for the sake of which men of good family rightly wander away from their houses to a houseless state. 'Birth had been destroyed, a religious life had been led, what was to be done had been done, there was nothing else (to be done) for this existence,' so he perceived, and the venerable Sabhiya became one of the saints.</p>

Sela, the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a, arrived at that place with his three hundred young men; seeing the preparations he asks what is going on, and is answered that Buddha is expected the next day. On hearing the word 'Buddha,' Sela asks where Buddha lives, goes to him, converses with him, and is converted; so are his followers.</blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was heard by me:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time Bhagavat wandering about in A<u>n</u>guttar&acirc;pa, with a large assembly of Bhikkhus, with 1250 Bhikkhus, went to &Acirc;pa<i>n</i>a, a town in A<u>n</u>guttar&acirc;pa.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ke<i>n</i>iya, the ascetic, with matted hair (<i>g</i>a<i>t</i>ila) heard the following: 'The Sama<i>n</i>a, the venerable Gotama, the Sakya son, gone out from the family of the Sakyas, wandering about in A<u>n</u>guttar&acirc;pa with a large assembly of Bhikkhus, with 1250 Bhikkhus, has reached &Acirc;pa<i>n</i>a, and the following good praising words met the venerable Gotama: "And so he is Bhagavat, the venerable, the perfectly enlightened, endowed with science and works (vi<i>gg</i>&acirc;<i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>a), the happy, knowing the world, the incomparable, the charioteer of men that are to be subdued, the master, the enlightened of gods and men, the glorious; he teaches this world and the world of gods, of M&acirc;ras, of Brahmans, and beings comprising Sama<i>n</i>as and Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>as, gods and men, having himself known and seen them face to face; he teaches the Dhamma (which is) good in the beginning, in the middle, and in the end, is full of meaning and rich in words, quite complete; he teaches a religious life, and good is the sight of such saints."'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila, went (to the place) where</p> 
<p><a>p. 97</a></p> 
<p>Bhagavat was, and having gone there he talked pleasantly with him, and after having had some pleasant and remarkable conversation (with him) he sat down apart; and while Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila, was sitting down apart, Bhagavat, by religious talk, taught, advised, roused, and delighted him. Then Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila, having been taught, advised, roused, and delighted by Bhagavat through religious talk, said this to Bhagavat:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let the venerable Gotama accept my food tomorrow, together with the assembly of Bhikkhus.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This having been said, Bhagavat answered Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila: 'Large, O Ke<i>n</i>iya, is the assembly of Bhikkhus, one thousand two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus, and thou art intimate with the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>as.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second time Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila, said this to Bhagavat: 'Although, O venerable Gotama, the assembly of Bhikkhus is large, one thousand two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus, and I am intimate with the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>as, let the venerable Gotama accept my food to-morrow, together with the assembly of Bhikkhus.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second time Bhagavat said this to Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila: 'Large, O Ke<i>n</i>iya, is the assembly of Bhikkhus, one thousand two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus, and thou art intimate with the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>as.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third time Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila, said this to Bhagavat: 'Although, O venerable Gotama, the assembly of Bhikkhus is large, one thousand two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus, and I am intimate with the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as, yet let the venerable Gotama accept my food to-morrow, together with the assembly of Bhikkhus.' Bhagavat assented by being silent.</p> 
<p><a>p. 98</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila, having learnt the assent of Bhagavat, after rising from his seat went to his hermitage, and having gone there he addressed his friends and servants, his relatives and kinsmen (as follows): 'Let my venerable friends and servants, relatives and kinsmen hear me;--the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama has been invited by me to (take his) food (with me) to-morrow, together with the assembly of Bhikkhus; wherefore you must render me bodily service.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Surely, O venerable one,' so saying the friends and servants, relatives and kinsmen of Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila, complying with his request, some of them dug fireplaces, some chopped firewood, some washed the vessels, some placed waterpots, some prepared seats. Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila, on the other hand, himself provided a circular pavilion.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Sela lived at &Acirc;pa<i>n</i>a, perfect in the three Vedas, vocabulary, Ke<i>t</i>ubha, etymology, Itih&acirc;sa as the fifth (Veda), versed in metre, a grammarian, one not deficient in popular controversy and the signs of a great man, he taught three hundred young men the hymns<sup>[1]</sup>. At that time Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila, was intimate with the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a Sela. Then the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Sela surrounded by three hundred young men, walking on foot, arrived at the place where the hermitage of Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila, was. And the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Sela saw the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ilas in Ke<i>n</i>iya's hermitage, some of them digging fireplaces, some chopping firewood, some washing the vessels, some placing waterpots, some</p>

<p><a>p. 99</a></p> 
<p>preparing seats, and Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila, on the other hand, himself providing a circular pavilion; seeing Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila, he said this: 'Is the venerable Ke<i>n</i>iya to celebrate the marriage of a son or the marriage of a daughter, or is there a great sacrifice at hand, or has Bimbis&acirc;ra, the king of Magadha, who has a large body of troops, been invited for to-morrow, together with his army?'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I am not to celebrate the marriage of a son or the marriage of a daughter, nor has Bimbis&acirc;ra, the king of Magadha, who has a large body of troops, been invited for to-morrow, together with his army, yet a great sacrifice of mine is at hand. The Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama, the Sakya son, gone out from the Sakya family, wandering about in A<u>n</u>guttar&acirc;pa with a large assembly of Bhikkhus, one thousand two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus, has reached &Acirc;pa<i>n</i>a, and the following good praising words met the venerable Gotama: "And so he is Bhagavat, the venerable, the perfectly enlightened, endowed with science and works (vi<i>gg</i>&acirc;<i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>a), the happy, knowing the world, the incomparable, the charioteer of men that are to be subdued, the master, the enlightened of gods and men, the glorious, he has been invited by me for to-morrow, together with the assembly of Bhikkhus."'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Didst thou say that he is a Buddha, O venerable Ke<i>n</i>iya?'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yes, I say, O venerable Sela, that he is a Buddha.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Didst thou say that he is a Buddha, O venerable Ke<i>n</i>iya? ,</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yes, I say, O venerable Sela, that he is a Buddha.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then this occurred to the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a Sela: 'This sound "Buddha" is (indeed) rare, but in our hymns</p> 
<p><a>p. 100</a></p> 
<p>are to be found the thirty-two signs of a great man, and for a great man endowed with these there are two conditions, and no more: if he lives in a house he is a king, a universal (king), a just religious king, a lord of the four-cornered (earth), a conqueror, one who has obtained the security of his people (and) is possessed of the seven gems. These are his seven gems, namely, the wheel gem, the elephant gem, the horse gem, the pearl gem, the woman gem, the householder gem, and the chief gem as the seventh. He has more than a thousand sons, heroes, possessing great bodily strength and crushing foreign armies; he having conquered this ocean-girt earth without a rod and without a weapon, but by justice, lives (in a house). But if, on the other hand, he goes out from (his) house to the houseless state, he becomes a saint, a perfectly enlightened, one who has removed the veil in the world. And where, O venerable Ke<i>n</i>iya, dwells now that venerable Gotama, the saint and the perfectly enlightened?'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This having been said, Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila, stretching out his right arm, spoke as follows to the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Sela: 'There, where yon blue forest line is, O venerable Sela.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Sela together with (his) three hundred young men went to the place where Bhagavat was. Then the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Sela addressed those young men: 'Come ye, venerable ones, with but little noise, walking step by step, for Bhagavats are difficult of access, walking alone like lions, and when I speak to the venerable Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama, do ye not utter interrupting words, but wait ye venerable ones, for the end of my speech.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Sela went to the place where</p> 
<p><a>p. 101</a></p> 
<p>Bhagavat was, and having gone there he talked pleasantly with Bhagavat, and after having had some pleasant and remarkable conversation with him he sat down apart, and while sitting down apart Sela, the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a, looked for the thirty-two signs of a great man on the body of Bhagavat. And the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Sela saw the thirty-two signs of a great man on the body of Bhagavat with the exception of two; in respect to two of the signs of a great man he had doubts, he hesitated, he was not satisfied, he was not assured as to the member being enclosed in a membrane and as to his having a large tongue.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then this occurred to Bhagavat: 'This Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Sela sees in me the thirty-two signs of a great man with the exception of two, in respect to two of the signs of a great man he has doubts, he hesitates, he is not satisfied, he is not assured as to the member being enclosed in a membrane, and as to my having a large tongue.' Then Bhagavat created such a miraculous creature that the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Sela might see Bhagavat's member enclosed in a membrane. Then Bhagavat having put out his tongue touched and stroked both his ears, touched and stroked both nostrils, and the whole circumference of his forehead he covered with his tongue.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then this occurred to the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a Sela: 'The Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama is endowed with the thirty-two signs of a great man, with them all, not with (only) some of them, and yet I do not know whether he is a Buddha or not; I have heard old and aged Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as, teachers and their previous teachers, say that those who are saints and perfectly enlightened manifest themselves when their praise is uttered. I think I shall praise the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama face to</p> 
<p><a>p. 102</a></p> 
<p>face in suitable stanzas.' Then the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Sela praised Bhagavat face to face in suitable stanzas:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. 'Thou hast a perfect body, thou art resplendent, well-born, of beautiful aspect, thou hast a golden colour, O Bhagavat, thou hast very white teeth, thou art strong. (548)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. 'All the signs that are for a well-born man, they are on thy body, the signs of a great man. (549)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. 'Thou hast a bright eye, a handsome countenance, thou art great, straight, majestic, thou shinest like a sun in the midst of the assembly of the Sama<i>n</i>as. (550)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. 'Thou art a Bhikkhu of a lovely appearance, thou hast a skin like gold; what is the use of being a Sama<i>n</i>a to thee who art possessed of the highest beauty? (551)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. 'Thou deservest to be a king, a king of universal kings, a ruler of the four-cornered (earth), a conqueror, a lord of the jambu grove (i.e. India). (552)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. 'Khattiyas and wealthy kings are devoted to thee; rule, O Gotama, as a king of kings, a leader of men.' (553)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. 'I am a king, O Sela,'--so said Bhagavat,--'an incomparable, religious king (dhammar&acirc;<i>g</i>an), with justice (dhammena) I turn the wheel, a wheel that is irresistible<sup>[1]</sup>.' (554)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. 'Thou acknowledgest thyself (to be) perfectly enlightened (sambuddha),'--so said Sela, the Br&acirc;hmana,--'an incomparable, religious king; "with justice I turn the wheel," so thou sayest, O Gotama. (555)</p> 
<p>[1. Compare Gospel of <a href="../../bib/kjv/joh.htm#18:37">S. John xviii. 37</a>.]</p> 
<p><a>p. 103</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. 'Who is thy general, (who is thy) disciple, (who is) the successor of the master, who is to turn after thee the wheel of religion turned (by thee)? ' (556)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. 'The wheel turned by me, O Sela,'--so said Bhagavat,--'the incomparable wheel of religion, S&acirc;riputta is to turn after (me), he taking after Tath&acirc;gata. (557)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. 'What is to be known is known (by me), what is to be cultivated is cultivated (by me), what is to be left is left by me, therefore I am a Buddha, O Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a. (558)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>12. 'Subdue thy doubt about me, have faith (in me), O Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a, difficult (to obtain) is the sight of Buddhas repeatedly. (559)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>13. 'Of those whose manifestation is difficult for you (to obtain) in the world repeatedly, I am, O Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a, a perfectly enlightened, an incomparable physician, (560)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>14. 'Most eminent, matchless, a crusher of M&acirc;ra's army; having subjected all enemies I rejoice secure on every side.' (561)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>15. Sela: 'O venerable ones, pay attention to this: as the clearly-seeing (Buddha) says, (so it is): he is a physician, a great hero, and roars like a lion in the forest. (562)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>16. 'Who, having seen him, the most eminent, the matchless, the crusher of M&acirc;ra's army, is not appeased, even if he be, of black origin (ka<i>n</i>h&acirc;bhi<i>g</i>&acirc;tika). (563)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>17. 'He who likes me, let him follow after (me), he who does not like me, let him go away; I shall at once take the orders in the presence of him of excellent understanding (i.e. Buddha).' (564)</p> 
<p><a>p. 104</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>18. The followers of Sela: 'If this doctrine of the perfectly enlightened pleases thee, we also shall take the orders in the presence of him of excellent understanding.' (565)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>19. These three hundred Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>as asked with clasped hands (to be admitted into the order): 'We want to cultivate a religious life, O Bhagavat, in thy presence.' (566)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>20. 'A religious life is well taught (by me), O Sela,'--so said Bhagavat,--'an instantaneous, an immediate (life), in which it is not in vain to become an ascetic to one who learns in earnest<sup>[1]</sup>.' (567)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Sela together with his assembly took the robe and the orders in the presence of Bhagavat.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila, by the expiration of that night, having provided in his hermitage nice hard food and soft food, let Bhagavat know the time (of the meal): 'It is time, O venerable Gotama, the meal is prepared.' Then Bhagavat in the morning, having put on his raiment and taken his bowl and robes, went to the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila Ke<i>n</i>iya's hermitage, and having gone there he sat down on the prepared seat, together with the assembly of Bhikkhus. Then Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila, satisfied and served with his own hands the assembly of Bhikkhus, with Buddha at their head, with nice hard food and soft food. Then Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila, having gone up to Bhagavat who had finished eating and had taken his hand out of the bowl, took a low seat and sat down apart, and</p>

<p><a>p. 105</a></p> 
<p>while Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila, was sitting down apart, Bhagavat delighted him with these stanzas:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>21. 'The principal thing in sacrifice is the sacred fire, the principal thing amongst the hymns is the S&acirc;vitti<sup>[1]</sup>, the king is the principal amongst men, and the sea the principal amongst waters (nad&icirc;na<i>m</i><sup>[2]</sup>). (568)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>22. 'Amongst the stars the moon is the principal thing, the sun is the principal thing amongst the burning<sup>[3]</sup> (objects), amongst those that wish for good works and make offerings the assembly (sa<i>m</i>gha) indeed is the principal.' (569)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Bhagavat, having delighted Ke<i>n</i>iya, the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila, with these stanzas, rose from (his) seat and went away.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the venerable Sela together with his assembly leading a solitary, retired, strenuous, ardent, energetic life, lived after having in a short time in this existence by his own understanding ascertained and possessed himself of that highest perfection of a religious life for the sake of which men of good family rightly wander away from their houses to a houseless state; 'birth (had been) destroyed, a religious life (had been) led, what was to be done (had been) done, there was nothing else (to be done) for this existence,' so he perceived, and the venerable Sela together with his assembly became one of the saints.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the venerable Sela together with his assembly went to Bhagavat, and having gone (to him) he put his upper robe on one shoulder, and bending his joined hands towards Bhagavat he addressed him in stanzas:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>23. 'Because we took refuge in thee on the eighth day previous to this, O thou clearly-seeing, in seven nights, O Bhagavat, we have been trained in thy doctrine. (570)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>24. 'Thou art Buddha, thou art the Master, thou art the Muni that conquered M&acirc;ra, thou hast, after cutting off the affections, crossed over (the stream of existence) and taken over these beings. (571)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>25. 'The elements of existence (upadhi) have been overcome by thee, the passions have been destroyed by thee, thou art a lion not seizing on anything, thou hast left behind fear and danger. (572)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. Without a cause and unknown is the life of mortals in this world, troubled and brief, and combined with pain. (574)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. For there is not any means by which those that have been born can avoid dying; after reaching old age there is death, of such a nature are living beings. (575)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. As ripe fruits are early in danger of falling, so mortals when born are always in danger of death. (576)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. As all earthen vessels made by the potter end in being broken, so is the life of mortals. (577)</p> 
<p><a>p. 107</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. Both young and grown-up men, both those who are fools and those who are wise men, all fall into the power of death, all are subject to death. (578)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. Of those who, overcome by death, go to the other world, a father does not save his son, nor relatives their relations. (579)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. Mark! while relatives are looking on and lamenting greatly, one by one of the mortals is carried off, like an ox that is going to be killed. (580)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. So the world is afflicted with death and decay, therefore the wise do not grieve, knowing the terms of the world. (581)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. For him, whose way thou dost not know, either when he is coming or when he is going, not seeing both ends, thou grievest in vain. (582)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. If he who grieves gains anything, (although he is only) a fool hurting himself, let the wise man do the same. (583)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. Not from weeping nor from grieving will any one obtain peace of mind; (on the contrary), the greater his pain will be, and his body will suffer. (584)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>12. He will be lean and pale, hurting himself by himself, (and yet) the dead are not saved, lamentation (therefore) is of no avail. (585)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>13. He who does not leave grief behind, goes (only) deeper into pain; bewailing the dead he falls into the power of grief. (586)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>14. Look at others passing away, men that go (to what they deserve) according to their deeds, beings trembling already here, after falling into the power of death. (587)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>15. In whatever manner people think (it will come to pass), different from that it becomes, so great is</p> 
<p><a>p. 108</a></p> 
<p>the disappointment<sup>[1]</sup> (in this world); see, (such are) the terms of the world. (588)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>16. Even if a man lives a hundred years or even more, he is at last separated from the company of his relatives, and leaves life in this world. (589)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>17. Therefore let one, hearing (the words of) the saint, subdue his lamentation; seeing the one that has passed away and is dead, (let him say): 'He will not be found by me (any more).' (590)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>18. As a house on fire is extinguished by water, so also the wise, sensible, learned, clever man rapidly drives away sorrow that has arisen, as the wind a tuft of cotton. (591)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>19. He who seeks his own happiness should draw out his arrow (which is) his lamentation, and complaint, and grief. (592)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>20. He who has drawn out the arrow and is not dependent (on anything) will obtain peace of mind; he who has overcome all sorrow will become free from sorrow, and blessed (nibbuta). (593)</p>

The two young men are converted.--Text (from Ma<i>ggh</i>imanik&acirc;ya) and translation in Alwis's Buddhist Nirv&acirc;na, p. 103.</blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was heard by me:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time Bhagavat dwelt at I<i>kkh</i>&acirc;na<i>m</i>kala, in the I<i>kkh</i>&acirc;na<i>m</i>kala forest. At that time many distinguished,</p> 
<p>[1. Et&acirc;diso vin&acirc;bh&acirc;vo.]</p> 
<p><a>p. 109</a></p> 
<p>wealthy Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>as lived at I<i>kkh</i>&acirc;na<i>m</i>kala, as the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a <i>K</i>a<i>m</i>kin, the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a T&acirc;rukkha, the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Pokkharas&acirc;ti, the Br&acirc;hmana <i>G</i>&acirc;nusso<i>n</i>i, the Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a Todeyya, and other distinguished, wealthy Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>as.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then this dialogue arose between the young men V&acirc;settha and Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a while walking about:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'How does one become a Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a?'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a said: 'When one is noble by birth on both sides, on the mother's and on the father's side, of pure conception up to the seventh generation of ancestors, not discarded and not reproached in point of birth, in this way one is a Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man V&acirc;se<i>tth</i>a said: 'When one is virtuous and endowed with (holy) works, in this way he is a Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither could the young man Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a convince the young man V&acirc;se<i>tth</i>a, nor could the young man V&acirc;se<i>tth</i>a convince the young man Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a. Then the young man V&acirc;se<i>tth</i>a addressed the young man Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a: 'O Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a, this Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama, the Sakya son, gone out from the Sakya family, dwells at I<i>kkh</i>&acirc;na<i>m</i>kala, in the forest of I<i>kkh</i>&acirc;na<i>m</i>kala, and the following good praising words met the venerable Gotama: "And so he is Bhagavat, the venerable, the enlightened, the glorious, let us go, O venerable Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a, let us go (to the place) where the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama is, and having gone there let us ask the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama about this matter, and as the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama replies so will we understand it."'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Very well, O venerable one;' so the young man Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a answered the young man V&acirc;se<i>tth</i>a.</p> 
<p><a>p. 110</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the young men V&acirc;se<i>tth</i>a and Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a went (to the place) where Bhagavat was, and having gone, they talked pleasantly with Bhagavat, and after having had some pleasant and remarkable conversation (with him) they sat down apart. Sitting down apart the young man V&acirc;se<i>tth</i>a addressed Bhagavat in stanzas:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. 'We are accepted and acknowledged masters of the three Vedas<sup>[1]</sup>, I am (a pupil) of Pokkharas&acirc;ti, and this young man is (the pupil) of T&acirc;rukkha. (594)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. 'We have a controversy regarding (the distinctions of) birth, O Gotama! Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<i>g</i>a says, one is a Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>a by birth, and I say, by deeds; know this, O thou clearly-seeing! (596)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. 'We are both unable to convince each other, (therefore) we have come to ask thee (who art) celebrated as perfectly enlightened. (597)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. 'As people adoring the full moon worship (her) with uplifted clasped hands, so (they worship) Gotama in the world. (598)</p>

KOK&Acirc;LIYASUTTA.</h2> <blockquote>Kok&acirc;liya abuses S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na to Buddha; therefore as soon as he has left Buddha, he is struck with boils, dies and goes to the Paduma hell, whereupon Buddha describes to the Bhikkhus the punishment of backbiters in hell.</blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was heard by me:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time Bhagavat dwelt at S&acirc;vatth&icirc;, in <i>G</i>etavana, in the park of An&acirc;thapi<i>nd</i>ika. Then the Bhikkhu Kok&acirc;liya approached Bhagavat, and after having approached and saluted Bhagavat he sat down apart; sitting down apart the Bhikkhu Kok&acirc;liya said this to Bhagavat: "O thou venerable one, S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na have evil desires, they have fallen into the power of evil desires.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this had been said, Bhagavat spoke to the Bhikkhu Kok&acirc;liya as follows: '(Do) not (say) so, Kok&acirc;liya; (do) not (say) so, Kok&acirc;liya; appease, O Kok&acirc;liya, (thy) mind in regard to S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na: S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na are amiable<sup>[1]</sup>.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second time the Bhikkhu Kok&acirc;liya said this to Bhagavat: 'Although thou, O venerable Bhagavat, (appearest) to me (to be) faithful and trustworthy, yet S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na have evil desires, they have fallen into the power of evil desires.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second time Bhagavat said this to the Bhikkhu Kok&acirc;liya: '(Do) not (say) so, Kok&acirc;liya; (do) not (say) so, Kok&acirc;liya; appease, O Kok&acirc;liya, (thy) mind in regard to S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na: S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na are amiable.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third time the Bhikkhu Kok&acirc;liya said this to Bhagavat: 'Although thou, O venerable Bhagavat, (appearest) to me (to be) faithful and trustworthy,</p> 
<p>[1. Pesal&acirc; ti piyas&icirc;l&acirc;. Commentator.]</p> 
<p><a>p. 119</a></p> 
<p>yet S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na have evil desires, S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na have fallen into the power of evil desires.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third time Bhagavat said this to the Bhikkhu Kok&acirc;liya: '(Do) not (say) so, Kok&acirc;liya; (do) not (say) so, Kok&acirc;liya; appease, O Kok&acirc;liya, (thy) mind in regard to S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na: S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na are amiable.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Bhikkhu Kok&acirc;liya, after having risen from his seat and saluted Bhagavat and walked round him towards the right, went away; and when he had been gone a short time, all his body was struck with boils as large as mustard seeds; after being only as large as mustard seeds, they became as large as kidney beans; after being only as large as kidney beans, they became as large as chick peas; after being only as large as chick peas, they became as large as a Kola<i>tth</i>i egg (?); after being only as large as a Kola<i>tth</i>i egg, they became as large as the jujube fruit; after being only as large as the jujube fruit, they became as large as the fruit of the emblic myrobalan; after being only as large as the fruit of the emblic myrobalan, they became as large as the unripe beluva fruit; after being only as large as the unripe beluva fruit, they became as large as a billi fruit (?); after being as large as a billi fruit, they broke, and matter and blood flowed out. Then the Bhikkhu Kok&acirc;liya died of that disease, and when he had died the Bhikkhu Kok&acirc;liya went to the Paduma hell, having shown a hostile mind against S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na. Then when the night had passed Brahman Sahampati of a beautiful appearance, having lit up all <i>G</i>etavana, approached Bhagavat, and having approached and saluted Bhagavat,</p> 
<p><a>p. 120</a></p> 
<p>he stood apart, and standing apart Brahman Sahampati said this to Bhagavat: 'O thou venerable one, Kok&acirc;liya, the Bhikkhu, is dead and after death, O thou venerable one, the Bhikkhu Kok&acirc;liya is gone to the Paduma hell, having shown a hostile mind against S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This said Brahman Sahampati, and after saying this and saluting Bhagavat, and walking round him towards the right, he disappeared there.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Bhagavat, after the expiration of that night, addressed the Bhikkhus thus: 'Last night, O Bhikkhus, when the night had (nearly) passed, Brahman Sahampati of a beautiful appearance, having lit up all <i>G</i>etavana, approached Bhagavat, and having approached and saluted Bhagavat, he stood apart, and standing apart Brahman Sahampati said this to Bhagavat: "O thou venerable one, Kok&acirc;liya, the Bhikkhu, is dead; and after death, O thou venerable one, the Bhikkhu Kok&acirc;liya is gone to the Paduma hell, having shown a hostile mind against S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na." This said Brahman Sahampati, O Bhikkhus, and having said this and saluted me, and walked round me towards the right, he disappeared there.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this had been said, a Bhikkhu asked Bhagavat: 'How long is the rate of life, O venerable one, in the Paduma hell?'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Long, O Bhikkhu, is the rate of life in the Paduma hell, it is not easy to calculate either (by saying) so many years or so many hundreds of years or so many thousands of years or so many hundred thousands of years.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But it is possible, I suppose, to make a comparison, O thou venerable one?'</p> 
<p><a>p. 121</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is possible, O Bhikkhu;' so saying, Bhagavat spoke (as follows): 'Even as, O Bhikkhu, (if there were) a Kosala load of sesamum seed containing twenty kh&acirc;ris, and a man after the lapse of every hundred years were to take from it one sesamum seed at a time, then that Kosala load of sesamum seed, containing twenty kh&acirc;ris, would, O Bhikkhu, sooner by this means dwindle away and be used up than one Abbuda hell; and even as are twenty Abbuda hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Nirabbuda hell; and even as are twenty Nirabbuda hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Ababa hell; and even as are twenty Ababa hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Ahaha hell; and even as are twenty Ahaha hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one A<i>t</i>a<i>t</i>a hell; and even as are twenty A<i>t</i>a<i>t</i>a hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Kumuda hell; and even as are twenty Kumuda hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Sogandhika hell; and even as are twenty Sogandhika hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Uppalaka hell; and even as are twenty Uppalaka hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Pu<i>nd</i>ar&icirc;ka hell; and even as are twenty Pu<i>nd</i>ar&icirc;ka hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Paduma hell; and to the Paduma hell, O Bhikkhu, the Bhikkhu Kok&acirc;liya is gone, having shown a hostile mind against S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na.' This said Bhagavat, and having said this Sugata, the Master, furthermore spoke as follows:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. 'To (every) man that is born, an axe is born in his mouth, by which the fool cuts himself, when speaking bad language. (657)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. 'He who praises him who is to be blamed or blames him who as to be praised, gathers up sin in his mouth, and through that (sin) he will not find any joy. (658)</p> 
<p><a>p. 122</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. 'Trifling is the sin that (consists in) losing riches by dice; this is a greater sin that corrupts the mind against Sugatas. (659)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. 'Out of the one hundred thousand Nirabbudas (he goes) to thirty-six, and to five Abbudas; because he blames an Ariya he goes to hell, having employed his speech and mind badly. (660)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. 'He who speaks falsely goes to hell, or he who having done something says, "I have not done it;" both these after death become equal, in another world (they are both) men guilty of a mean deed<sup>[1]</sup>. (661)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. 'He who offends an offenceless man, a pure man, free from sin, such a fool the evil (deed) reverts against, like fine dust thrown against the wind<sup>[2]</sup>. (662)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. 'He who is given to the quality of covetousness, such a one censures others in his speech, (being himself) unbelieving, stingy, wanting in affability, niggardly, given to backbiting. (663)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. 'O thou foul-mouthed, false, ignoble, blasting, wicked, evil-doing, low, sinful, base-born man, do not be garrulous in this world, (else) thou wilt be an inhabitant of hell<sup>[3]</sup>. (664)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. 'Thou spreadest pollution to the misfortune (of others), thou revilest the just, committing sin (yourself), and having done many evil deeds thou wilt go to the pool (of hell) for a long time. (665)</p>

N&Acirc;LAKASUTTA.</h2> <blockquote>The Isi Asita, also called Ka<i>n</i>hasiri, on seeing the gods rejoicing, asks the cause of it, and having heard that Buddha has been born, he descends from Tusita heaven. When the Sakyas showed the child to him, he received it joyfully and prophesied</blockquote> [1.

<p><a>p. 125</a></p> <blockquote>about it. Buddha explains to N&acirc;laka, the sister's son of Asita, the highest state of wisdom.--Compare Lalita-vistara, Adhy&acirc;ya VII; Asita and Buddha, or the Indian Simeon, by J. Muir, in the Indian Antiquary, Sept. 1878.</blockquote> 
<p align="CENTER">Vatthug&acirc;th&acirc;.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. The Isi Asita saw in (their) resting-places during the day the joyful, delighted flocks of the Tidasa gods, and the gods in bright clothes, always highly praising Inda, after taking their clothes and waving them. (679)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. Seeing the gods with pleased minds, delighted, and showing his respect, he said this on that occasion: 'Why is the assembly of the gods so exceedingly pleased, why do they take their clothes and wave them? (680)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. 'When there was an encounter with the Asuras, a victory for the gods, and the Asuras were defeated, then there was not such a rejoicing. What wonderful (thing) have the gods seen that they are so delighted? (681)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. 'They shout and sing and make music, they throw (about their) arms and dance; I ask you, the inhabitants of the tops of (mount) Meru, remove my doubt quickly, O venerable ones!' (682)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. 'The Bodhisatta, the excellent pearl, the incomparable, is born for the good and for a blessing in the world of men, in the town of the Sakyas, in the country of Lumbin&icirc;. Therefore we are glad and exceedingly pleased. (683)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. 'He, the most excellent of all beings, the preeminent man, the bull of men, the most excellent of all creatures will turn the wheel (of the Dhamma) in the forest called after the Isis, (he who is) like the roaring lion, the strong lord of beasts.' (684)</p> 
<p><a>p. 126</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. Having heard that noise he descended from (the heaven of) Tusita. Then he went to Suddhodana's palace, and having sat down there he said this to the Sakyas: 'Where is the prince? I wish to see (him).' (685)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. Then the Sakyas showed to (the Isi), called Asita, the child, the prince who was like shining gold, manufactured by a very skilful (smith) in the mouth of a forge, and beaming in glory and having a beautiful appearance. (686)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. Seeing the prince shining like fire, bright like the bull of stars wandering in the sky, like the burning sun in autumn, free from clouds, he joyfully obtained great delight. (687)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. The gods held in the sky a parasol with a thousand circles and numerous branches, yaks' tails with golden sticks were fanned, but those who held the yaks' tails and the parasol were not seen. (688)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. The Isi with the matted hair, by name Ka<i>n</i>hasiri, on seeing the yellow blankets (shining) like a golden coin, and the white parasol held over his head, received him delighted and happy. (689)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>12. And having received the bull of the Sakyas, he who was wishing to receive him and knew the signs and the hymns, with pleased thoughts raised his voice, saying: 'Without superior is this, the most excellent of men.' (690)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>13. Then remembering his own migration he was displeased and shed tears; seeing this the Sakyas asked the weeping Isi, whether there would be any obstacle in the prince's path. (691)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>14. Seeing the Sakyas displeased the Isi said: 'I do not remember anything (that will be) unlucky for the prince, there will be no obstacles at</p> 
<p><a>p. 127</a></p> 
<p>all for him, for this is no inferior (person). Be without anxiety. (692)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>15. ' This prince will reach the summit of perfect enlightenment, he will turn the wheel of the Dhamma, he who sees what is exceedingly pure (i.e. Nibb&acirc;na), this (prince) feels for the welfare of the multitude, and his religion<sup>[1]</sup> will be widely spread. (693)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>16. 'My life here will shortly be at an end, in the middle (of his life) there will be death for me; I shall not hear the Dhamma of the incomparable one; therefore I am afflicted, unfortunate, and suffering.' (694)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>17. Having afforded the Sakyas great joy he went out from the interior of the town to lead a religious life; but taking pity on his sister's son, he induced him to embrace the Dhamma of the incomparable one. (695)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>18. 'When thou hearest from others the sound "Buddha," (or) "he who has acquired perfect enlightenment walks the way of the Dhamma," then going there and enquiring about the particulars, lead a religious life with that Bhagavat.' (696)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>19. Instructed by him, the friendly-minded, by one who saw in the future what is exceedingly pure (i.e. Nibb&acirc;na), he, N&acirc;laka, with a heap of gathered-up good works, and with guarded senses dwelt (with him), looking forward to <i>G</i>ina (i.e. Buddha). (697)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>20. Hearing the noise, while the excellent <i>G</i>ina turned the wheel (of the Dhamma), and going and seeing the bull of the Isis, he, after being converted,</p>

If, O Bhikkhus, there should be people that ask so, they shall be answered thus: "Yes, for the right understanding of the two Dhammas." "Which two do you mean?" "(I mean), this is pain, this is the origin of pain," this is one consideration, "this is the destruction of pain, this is the way leading to the destruction of pain," this is the second consideration; thus, O Bhikkhus, by the Bhikkhu that considers the Dyad duly<sup>[1]</sup>, is strenuous, ardent, resolute, of two fruits one fruit is to be expected: in this world perfect knowledge, or, if any of the (five) attributes still remain, the state of an An&acirc;g&acirc;min (one that does not return).'

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"Should there be a perfect consideration of the Dyad in another way," if, O Bhikkhus, there are people that ask so, they shall be told, there is, and how there is: "What, O Bhikkhus, has been considered pleasure by the world of men, gods, M&acirc;ra, Brahman, and amongst the Sama<i>n</i>as, Br&acirc;ma<i>n</i>as, gods, and men, that has by the noble by (their) perfect knowledge been well seen to be really pain," this is one consideration; "what, O Bhikkhus, has been considered pain by the world of men, gods, M&acirc;ra, Brahman, and amongst the Sama<i>n</i>as, Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as, gods, and men, that has by the noble by their perfect knowledge been well seen to be really pleasure," this is the second consideration.

<p>Bhikkhus, by the Bhikkhu who considers the Dyad duly, who is strenuous, ardent, resolute, of two fruits one fruit is to be expected: in this world perfect knowledge, or, if any of the (five) attributes still remain, the state of an An&acirc;g&acirc;min (one who does not return).' This said Bhagavat, (and) when Sugata had said so, the Master further spoke:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>36. 'Form, sound, taste, smell, and touch are all wished for, pleasing and charming (things) as long as they last, so it is said. (759)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>37. 'By you, by the world of men and gods these (things) are deemed a pleasure, but when they cease it is deemed pain by them. (760)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>38. 'By the noble the cessation of the existing body is regarded as pleasure; this is the opposite of (what) the wise in all the world (hold)<sup>[1]</sup>. (761)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>39. 'What fools say is pleasure that the noble say is pain, what fools say is pain that the noble know as pleasure:--see here is a thing difficult to understand, here the ignorant are confounded. (762)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>40. 'For those that are enveloped there is gloom, for those that do not see there is darkness, and for the good it is manifest, for those that see there is light; (even being) near, those that are ignorant of the way and the Dhamma, do not discern (anything)<sup>[2]</sup>. (763)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>41. 'By those that are overcome by the passions of existence, by those that follow the stream of existence, by those that have entered the realm of M&acirc;ra, this Dhamma is not perfectly understood. (764)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>42. 'Who except the noble deserve the well-understood state (of Nibb&acirc;na)? Having perfectly conceived this state, those free from passion are completely extinguished<sup>[1]</sup>.' (765)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spoke Bhagavat. Glad those Bhikkhus rejoiced at the words of Bhagavat. While this explanation was being given, the minds of sixty Bhikkhus, not seizing (upon anything), were liberated.</p>
