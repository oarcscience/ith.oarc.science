## CHAPTER III.

THOUGHT.

   33. As a fletcher makes straight his arrow, a wise man makes straight
his trembling and unsteady thought, which is difficult to guard,
difficult to hold back.

   34. As a fish taken from his watery home and thrown on dry ground,
our thought trembles all over in order to escape the dominion of Mâra
(the tempter).

   35. It is good to tame the mind, which is difficult to hold in and
flighty, rushing wherever it listeth; a tamed mind brings happiness.

   36. Let the wise man guard his thoughts, for they are difficult to
perceive, very artful, and they rush wherever they list: thoughts well
guarded bring happiness.

   37. Those who bridle their mind which travels far, moves about alone,
is without a body, and hides in the chamber (of the heart), will be free
from the bonds of Mâra (the tempter).

   38. If a man's thoughts are unsteady, if he does not know the true
law, if his peace of mind is troubled, his knowledge will never be
perfect.

   39. If a man's thoughts are not dissipated, if

39\. Fausböll traces anavassuta, 'dissipated,' back to the Sanskrit root
*s*yai, 'to become rigid;' but the participle of that root would be
*s*îta, not *s*yuta. Professor Weber suggests that anavassuta stands for
the Sanskrit anavasruta, which he translates unbefleckt, 'unspotted.' If
avasruta were the right word; it might be taken in the sense of 'not
fallen off, not fallen away,' but it could not mean 'unspotted;' cf.
dhairya*m* no 'susruvat, 'our firmness ran away.' I have little doubt,
however, that avassuta represents the Sanskrit ava*s*ruta, and is
derived from the root *s*ru, here used in its technical sense, peculiar
to the Buddhist literature, and so well explained by Burnouf in his
Appendix XIV (Lotus, p. 820). He shows that, according to Hema*k*andra
and the *G*ina-ala<u>n</u>kâra, â*s*ravakshaya, Pâli âsavasa*m*khaya is
counted as the sixth abhi*gñ*â, wherever six of these intellectual
powers are mentioned, instead of five. The Chinese translate the term in
their Own Chinese fashion by 'stillationis finis,' but Burnouf claims
for it the definite sense of destruction of faults or vices. He quotes
from the Lalita-vistara (Adhyâya XXII, ed. Râjendra Lal Mittra, p. 448)
the words uttered by Buddha when he arrived at his complete
Buddhahood:--  
      *S*ushkâ â*s*ravâ na puna*h* *s*ravanti,  
      'The vices are dried up, they will not flow again;'  
and he shows that the Pâli Dictionary, the Abhidhânappadîpikâ, explains
âsava simply by kâma, 'love, pleasure of the senses.' In the
Mahâparinibbâna-sutta, three classes of âsava are distinguished, the
kâmâsavâ, the bhavâsavâ, and the avi*gg*âsavâ. See also Burnouf, Lotus,
p. 665; Childers, s.v. âsavo.

That *s*ru means 'to run,' and is in fact a merely dialectic variety of
sru, has been proved by Burnouf, while Boehtlingk thinks the
substitution of *s* for s is a mistake. Â*s*rava therefore, or âsrava,
meant originally 'the running out towards objects of the senses' (cf.
sa<u>n</u>ga, âlara, &c.), and had nothing to do with âsrâva, 'a
running, a sore,' Atharva-veda I, 2, 4. This conception of the original
purport of â + *s*ru or ava-*s*ru is confirmed by a statement of
Colebrooke's, who, when treating of the *G*ainas, writes (Miscellaneous
Essays, I, 382); 'Âsrava is that which directs the embodied spirit
(âsravayati purusham) towards external objects. It is the occupation and
employment (v*ri*tti or pra*vr*itti) of the senses or organs on sensible
objects. Through the means of the senses it, affects the embodied spirit
with the sentiment of taction, colour, smell, and taste. Or it is the
association or connection of body with right and wrong deeds. It
comprises all the karmas, for they (âsravayanti) pervade, influence, and
attend the doer, following him or attaching to him. It is a misdirection
(mithyâ-prav*ri*tti) of the organs, for it is vain, a cause of
disappointment, rendering the organs of sense and sensible objects
subservient to fruition. Sa*m*vara is that which stops (sa*m*v*rin*oti)
the course of the foregoing, or closes up the door or passage to it, and
consists in self-command or restraint of organs internal and external,
embracing all means of self-control and subjection of the senses,
calming and subduing them.'

For a full account of the â*s*ravas, see Lalita-vistara, ed. Calc. pp.
445 and 552, where Kshî*n*â*s*rava is given as a name of Buddha.
Â*s*râva occurs in Âpastamba's Dharma-sûtras II, 5, 9, where the
commentator explains it by objects of the senses, by which the soul is
made to run out. It is better, however, to take â*s*râva here, too, as
the act of running out, the affections, appetites, passions.\]

his mind is not perplexed, if he has ceased to think of good or evil,
then there is no fear for him while he is watchful.

   40. Knowing that this body is (fragile) like a jar, and making this
thought firm like a fortress, one should attack Mâra (the tempter) with
the weapon of knowledge, one should watch him when conquered, and should
never rest.

   41. Before long, alas! this body will lie on the earth, despised,
without understanding, like a useless log.

   42. Whatever a hater may do to a hater, or

\[40. Anivesana has no doubt a technical meaning, and may signify, one
who has left his house, his family and friends, to become a monk. A monk
shall not return to his home, but travel about; he shall be anivesana,
'homeless,' anâgâra, 'houseless.' But I doubt whether this can be the
meaning of anivesana here, as the sentence, let him be an anchorite,
would come in too abruptly. I translate it therefore in a more general
sense, let him not return or turn away from the battle, let him watch
Mâra, even after he is vanquished, let him keep up a constant fight
against the adversary, without being attached to anything or anybody.\]

an enemy to an enemy, a wrongly-directed mind will do us greater
mischief.

   43. Not a mother, not a father will do so much, nor any other
relative; a well-directed mind will do us greater service.
