### 9.

1\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to use bowls of
various kinds, made of gold and silver.

The people murmured (&c., as usual, down to) They told this matter to
the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to use bowls made

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

of gold, or made of silver, or set with jewels, or made of beryl
(ve*l*uriya <span id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_164).md), or made of crystal,
or made of copper, or made of glass <span
id="fr_170"></span>[2](#fn_165.md), or made of tin, or made of lead, or
made of bronze. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I
allow you, O Bhikkhus, bowls of two kinds,--those made of iron, and
those made of clay.'

2\. Now at that time the support at the bottom of the bowls wore
out <span id="fr_171"></span>[3](#fn_166.md).

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to use circular (pieces of metal) as the
supports for your bowls.'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to have various kinds
of circular supports to their bowls.--silver ones, and gold ones.

The people murmured (&c., down to) They told this matter to the Blessed
One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to have various kinds of circular supports to
your bowls. Whosoever does

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, two kinds
of circular supports to your bowls,--tin ones, and lead ones.'

The thick circular supports could not be inserted <span
id="fr_172"></span>[1](#fn_167.md). They told this matter to the Blessed
One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to shape them <span
id="fr_173"></span>[2](#fn_168.md) (until they get to be the right size to
fit in) <span id="fr_174"></span>[3](#fn_169.md).'

They would not stay in (?) <span id="fr_175"></span>[4](#fn_170.md).

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to split little pieces of crocodiles' teeth
(to fit them in with) <span id="fr_176"></span>[5](#fn_171.md).'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus had painted circular linings
to the bottoms of their bowls, with painted figures scattered over them,
or painted in patches of colour <span id="fr_177"></span>[6](#fn_172.md),
and they used to walk about the streets exhibiting them.

People murmured (&c., down to) They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to have painted circular supports to the
bottoms of your bowls, covered

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

with figures, and painted in patches of colour. Whosoever shall do so,
shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, only ordinary
linings.'

3\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus put away their bowls with water in
them, and the bowls were split.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to put away your bowls with water in them.
Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I enjoin upon you, O
Bhikkhus, to dry your bowls in the sunshine <span
id="fr_178"></span>[1](#fn_173.md) before putting them away.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus dried their bowls in the sunshine, with
water in them; and the bowls became evil-smelling.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to dry your bowls in the sunshine with water
in them. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I allow you,
O Bhikkhus; to empty out the water <span
id="fr_179"></span>[2](#fn_174.md), and then warm the bowls, before you put
them away.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus put their bowls away in a warm place; and
the colour of the bowls was spoilt.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to put your bowls away in a warm place.
Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I allow you, O
Bhikkhus, to dry your bowls for a short time in a warm place, and then
to put them away.'

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

4\. Now at that time a number of bowls were left in the open air without
supports; and the bowls were turned over by a whirlwind <span
id="fr_180"></span>[1](#fn_175.md) and broke.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of supports for your bowls (when they
are left out).'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus put their bowls away at the edge of the
sleeping-benches in the verandahs <span id="fr_181"></span>[2](#fn_176.md),
and the bowls fell down and were broken.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to put your bowls away on the edge of the
sleeping-benches in the verandah. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of
a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus put their bowls away on the edge of the
Paribha*nd*a <span id="fr_182"></span>[3](#fn_177.md), and the bowls fell
down and were broken.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to put your bowls away on the edge of the
Paribha*nd*a. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus turned their bowls upside down <span
id="fr_183"></span>[4](#fn_178.md) on the ground, and the lips wore out.

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a mat made of grass <span
id="fr_184"></span>[1](#fn_179.md).'

The grass-mat was eaten by white ants.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a small cloth <span
id="fr_185"></span>[2](#fn_180.md).'

The small cloth was eaten by the white ants. They told this matter to
the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a raised parapet (?) (on which to
put your bowls) <span id="fr_186"></span>[3](#fn_181.md).'

The bowls fell down from the parapet and were broken.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow your O Bhikkhus, the use of a wicker-work stand <span
id="fr_187"></span>[4](#fn_182.md).'

On the wicker-work stand the bowls wore out. They told this matter to
the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of bags to carry your bowls in.'

They had no shoulder-straps <span id="fr_188"></span>[5](#fn_183.md)

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a shoulder-strap (by which to carry
the bag), or of a piece of string (by which to tie it on).'

5\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus hung up their bowls on pins in the
walls, or on hooks <span id="fr_189"></span>[1](#fn_184.md). The pins or
hooks falling down, the bowls were broken.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to hang your bowls up. Whosoever does so,
shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus put their bowls down on a bed <span
id="fr_190"></span>[2](#fn_185.md), or a chair; and sitting down
thoughtlessly <span id="fr_191"></span>[3](#fn_186.md) they upset them, and
the bowls were broken.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to put your bowls on the bed, or on a chair.
Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus kept their bowls on their laps; and rising
up thoughtlessly they upset them, and the bowls were broken.

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to keep your bowls on your laps. Whosoever
does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus put their bowls down on a sunshade; and
the sunshade being lifted up by a whirlwind, the bowls rolled over, and
were broken.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to put your bowls down on a sunshade.
Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus, when they were holding the bowls in their
hands, opened the door <span id="fr_192"></span>[1](#fn_187.md). The door
springing back the bowls were broken.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to open the door with your bowls in your
hands. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_164"></span>[82:1](sbe20024.htm#fr_169.md) It is clear from
verses 192-196 of the 13th chapter of the Râ*g*a-nigha*nt*u, written by
Narahari of Kashmîr in the thirteenth century A. D., that at that time
Vai*d*ûrya meant 'cat's-eye: But it is uncertain whether that was the
only meaning of the word ve*l*uriya at the time when this passage was
composed. (See especially V. 124, p. 25, of Dr. Richard Garbe's edition
in his work, 'Die Indischen Mineralien,' Leipzig, 1882.) See also
Professor Max Müller's interesting note at p. 266 of his 'What can India
teach us?'

<span id="fn_165"></span>[82:2](sbe20024.htm#fr_170.md) Kâ*k*amayo. There
was probably no glass in our modern sense of the word when the
*K*ullavagga was written. But kâ*k*a is a silicious earth, and some sort
of glass-like earthenware may very well have been in use. The phrase has
already occurred, together with all the others in this passage, at
Mahâvagga V, 8, 3, of foot-coverings, but is omitted in the list at
Khudda Sikkhâ V. 10.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[82:3](sbe20024.htm#fr_171.md) Gha*m*sîyati.
Literally, 'were rubbed.' See below, § 3, and our note below on V, 9, 2,
4.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[83:1](sbe20024.htm#fr_172.md) A*kkh*ûpiyanti. On
the use of this word, compare Mahâvagga VIII, 14, 1, where it is used of
inserting a slip of cloth in a torn garment.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[83:2](sbe20024.htm#fr_173.md) See our note above
on V, 8, I. Buddhaghosa says here likhitun ti tanu-kara*n*-atthây’
eta*m* vutta*m*. The 'shaping' may be by carving, adzing, or planing.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[83:3](sbe20024.htm#fr_174.md) Compare above, V,
8, 1, and see Buddhaghosa's note at p. 316 of the edition of the text.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[83:4](sbe20024.htm#fr_175.md) The reading is
corrupt; and therefore this rendering is merely conjectural. See H.O.'s
note at p. 316 of his edition of the text.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[83:5](sbe20024.htm#fr_176.md) On these split
crocodiles' teeth, see our note above on V, 1, 4.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[83:6](sbe20024.htm#fr_177.md) Rûpakoki*nn*âni
bhati-kamma-katâni. Buddhaghosa has nothing on these words. On the
second, see below, VI, 2, 7, and H.O.'s note on that passage at p. 321
of the edition of the text. It is most probable that the reading in both
passages should be bhatti-kamma, 'patchwork,' as further explained in
our note below on VI, 2, 7; and we have translated accordingly.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[84:1](sbe20024.htm#fr_178.md) Otâpetvâ. The word
has already occurred in Mahâvagga I, 25, 16. Compare Khudda Sikkhâ V. 6.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[84:2](sbe20024.htm#fr_179.md) Vodaka*m* katvâ.
Vodaka*m* bears, of course, the same relation to sa-udaka*m*, used just
before, as vagga does to samagga. The expression has occurred already at
Mahâvagga I, 25, 13.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[85:1](sbe20024.htm#fr_180.md) Vâta-ma*nd*alikâya.
So also in the next section and in the Bhikkhunî-vibhaṅga, Pâ*k*ittiya
96. The reading at *G*âtaka I, 72 is vâta-ma*nd*ala*m*.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[85:2](sbe20024.htm#fr_181.md) Mi*dh*ante. This
word recurs below in VI, 2, 3, where see our note. Buddhaghosa's note is
given at p. 317 of the edition of the text. See also Khudda Sikkhâ V. 7.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[85:3](sbe20024.htm#fr_182.md) Used of a house,
this probably means a plastered flooring of scented earth or dried
cowdung. See *K*ullavagga VI, 17, 1, and Buddhaghosa's note there. On
the use of the word in tailoring, see Mahâvagga VII, 1, 5, VIII, 21.
Buddhaghosa, loc. cit. (p. 3 i 7), uses the expression
mattika-paribha*nd*a-katâya-bhûmiyâ.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[85:4](sbe20024.htm#fr_183.md) Nikku*gg*anti. See
the use of this word at V, 20, 3.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[86:1](sbe20024.htm#fr_184.md)
Ti*n*a-santhâraka*m*. That this word means a mat, and not a layer, of
grass is clear from its use at *G*âtaka I, 360, and below, V, II, 3.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[86:2](sbe20024.htm#fr_185.md) *K*olaka. The
meaning of the word is doubtful, but see Mahâvagga VIII, 18. In the
uddâna (at p. 143) the corresponding word is *k*ola. See also below, VI,
3, I, VI, 19, VI, 20, 2.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[86:3](sbe20024.htm#fr_186.md) Patta-mâlaka*m*.
Buddhaghosa says merely, 'It should be made either of bricks or of
wood.' He confirms the reading of the text (with *l* as against
Childers's reading mâlako).

<span id="fn_182"></span>[86:4](sbe20024.htm#fr_187.md) Patta-ka*nd*olikâ
ti mahâ-mukha-ku*nd*a-sa*nth*ânâ bhandakukkha*li*knâ vu*kk*ati (B.).
Ka*nd*ola is a wicker-work basket; see Böhtlingk-Roth, sub voce.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[86:5](sbe20024.htm#fr_188.md) See H.O.'s note on
the reading here; and compare the table of contents to this chapter (at
p. 143), where the reading a*m*sabaddha*m* confirms the suggested
alteration. If there were any <span id="page_87">p. 87</span> further
doubt it would be removed on comparing the closing words of Mahâvagga
VI, 12, 4, which are identical with the present passage and contain the
correct reading. The same remarks apply to other passages, where the
same words occur below, V, It, 5, V, 12, VI, 12, 3.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[87:1](sbe20024.htm#fr_189.md) The use of these
appliances is formally allowed at VI, 3, 5.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[87:2](sbe20024.htm#fr_190.md) Ma*ñk*a. Compare
Rh. D.'s note at p. 277 of the 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' and Khuddha
Sikkhâ V. 7.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[87:3](sbe20024.htm#fr_191.md) Sati-sammosâ. The
word occurs at Milinda-pa*n*ha (ed. Trenckner), p. 260. It must be
connected with mu*tth*a-sati, of which the Buddhist Sanskrit equivalent
is mushita-sm*ri*ti*h* (see Kathâ Sarit Sâgara 56, 289). It is evident
that Childers's original explanation of mu*tth*a-sati from mû*lh*a was
wrong, and that both words must be referred to the root mush, as he
points out at p. .618 of his Dictionary.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[88:1](sbe20024.htm#fr_192.md) Kavâta*m*
pa*n*âmetvâ. The construction of doors is described in detail at V, 14,
3, with reference to the bath-house, and again at VI, 2. That pa*n*âmeti
is to open, and not to shut, is clear from VIII, 1, 1, just as patta*m*
pa*n*âmeti at VIII, 5, 2 is to uncover, disclose, the bowl. Compare
Khuddha Sikkhâ V. 8.
