### 2.

1\. Now Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî went up to the place where the
Blessed One was, and bowed down before him, and stood respectfully on
one side. And, so standing, Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî spake thus to the
Blessed One: 'What course, Lord,

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

should I pursue towards these women of the Sâkya clan?'

Then the Blessed One taught Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî and incited her,
and aroused her, and gladdened her with religious discourse; and she, so
taught, incited, aroused, and gladdened, bowed down before the Blessed
One, and keeping him on net right hand as she passed him, she departed
thence.

Then the Blessed One, in that connexion, delivered a religious
discourse, and said to the Bhikkhus, 'I allow Bhikkhunîs, O Bhikkhus, to
receive the upasampadâ initiation from Bhikkhus <span

2\. Now those Bhikkhunîs said to Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî: 'Neither
have you received the upasampadâ initiation, nor have we; for it has
thus been laid down by the Blessed One: "Bhikkhunîs are to be initiated
by Bhikkhus."'

Then Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî went to the venerable Ânanda, and
\[repeated their words to him\]. And the venerable Ânanda went to the
Blessed One, and \[repeated them to him\].

'In that moment, Ânanda, when Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî took upon
herself the Eight Chief Rules, that was to her as the upasampadâ
initiation.'
