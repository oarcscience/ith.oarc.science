<p>1. Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_69"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 69</FONT></A></p>  
<p>used to wear ear-rings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_134"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and ear-drops&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and strings of beads for the throat, and girdles of beads&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and bangles&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and necklaces&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_134"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, and bracelets, and rings.</p>  
<p>The people murmured, &amp;c. . . . . The Bhikkhus heard, &amp;c. . . . . They told the, Blessed One (&amp;c., as in II, 1, 1, down to) he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to wear any of these things. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>2. [A similar paragraph concluding]</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to wear long hair. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, hair that is two months old, or two inches long.'</p>  
<p>3. [Similar paragraph concluding]</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to smooth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> the hair</p>

<p>with a comb, or with a smoothing instrument shaped like a snake's hood&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_140"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, or with the hand used as such an instrument&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_141"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, or with pomade&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_142"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, or with hair-oil of beeswax&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>4. [Similar paragraph concluding]</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to look at the image of your faces in a looking-glass, or a bowl of water&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had a sore in his face. He asked the Bhikkhus what kind of a sore he had. 'Such and such a kind of sore,' replied they. He did not believe what they said. They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, on account of a disease, to look at your faces in a looking-glass, or in a bowl of water.'</p>  
<p>5. Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus (&amp;c., down to)</p>

<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to anoint your faces, nor to rub (ointment, &amp;c.) into your faces, nor to put chunam on your faces, nor to smear red arsenic on your faces, nor to paint your bodies, nor to paint your faces&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="#fn_140"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had disease in his eyes. They told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, on account of disease, to anoint your faces.'</p>  
<p>6&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_146"></A><A HREF="#fn_141"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Now at that time there was a festival on the mountain-top&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_147"></A><A HREF="#fn_142"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> at R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha; and the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus went to see it.</p>  
<p>The people murmured, were annoyed, and became indignant, saying, 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama<I>n</I>as go to see dancing, and singing, and music, like those who are still enjoying the pleasures of the world?' And they told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to go to see dancing, or singing, or music. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_130"></A><A HREF="sbe20017.htm#fr_134">69:1</A> Vallik&acirc; ti ka<I>n</I><I>n</I>ato nikkhanta-mutt-olambak&acirc;d&icirc;na<I>m</I> eta<I>m</I> adhiva<I>k</I>ana<I>m</I>. Na kevala<I>&ntilde;</I> <I>k</I>a vallik&acirc; eva, ya<I>m</I> ki<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>i ka<I>n</I><I>n</I>a-pilandhana<I>m</I> antamaso t&acirc;la-panna<I>m</I> pi na va<I>t</I><I>t</I>ati (B.). Compare satavallika<I>m</I> at V, 29, 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_131"></A><A HREF="sbe20017.htm#fr_135">69:2</A> P&acirc;ma&#7749;ga. The meaning of which is not clear from Buddhaghosa's note loc. cit. It occurs also at D&icirc;pava<I>m</I>sa XII, 1, and below in Buddhaghosa's note on maddavi<I>n</I>a at V, 29, 2 (twice).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_132"></A><A HREF="sbe20017.htm#fr_136">69:3</A> Ka<I>t</I>i-suttaka<I>m</I>. This is not mentioned in the similar paragraph at V, 29, 2, where all special kinds of girdles are enumerated. It is forbidden below to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s at X, 16.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_133"></A><A HREF="sbe20017.htm#fr_137">69:4</A> Ova<I>t</I><I>t</I>ika. This word is explained by Buddhaghosa as the same as valaya<I>m</I>. Ova<I>t</I><I>t</I>iya occurs, apparently in a different sense, at Mah&acirc;vagga VII, 1, 5, and the present word in Buddhaghosa on sata-vallika<I>m</I> at V, 29, 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_134"></A><A HREF="sbe20017.htm#fr_138">69:5</A> K&acirc;yura, on which Buddhaghosa, loc. cit., merely says that the meaning of this, and of the following words, is evident. But the <I>G</I>&acirc;taka commentary (Fausb&ouml;ll III, 437, 14) says k&acirc;y&ucirc;an ti g&icirc;v&acirc;ya pilandhana-pas&acirc;dhana<I>m</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_135"></A><A HREF="sbe20017.htm#fr_139">69:6</A> Osa<I>n</I>heti. Compare the Sanskrit <I>s</I>laksh<I>n</I>ayati. The art of hair-dressing had, at the time when the <I>K</I>ullavagga was composed, been already carried to a high state of efficiency in the valley of the Ganges, as may reasonably be concluded from the numerous kinds of headdresses figured in bas-relief on some of the oldest Buddhist sculptures.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_136"></A><A HREF="sbe20017.htm#fr_140">70:1</A> Pha<I>n</I>aken&acirc; ti dantamay&acirc;disu yena kena<I>k</I>i (B.).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_137"></A><A HREF="sbe20017.htm#fr_141">70:2</A> Hattha-pha<I>n</I>aken&acirc; ti hatthen&#8217; eva pha<I>n</I>aka-ki<I>k</I><I>k</I>a<I>m</I> karonti, a&#7749;gul&icirc;hi osa<I>n</I>henti (B.). It is clear from this last explanation that the pha<I>n</I>aka was a kind of very primitive brush, but without bristles. In passing the fingers through the hair the fingers are naturally held separate, slightly forward, and stiff--precisely as one would hold them if one wished to imitate the hood of a cobra. To make a real brush with bristles was evidently beyond the mechanical appliances of those times, or such an article would certainly have been mentioned in this connection.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_138"></A><A HREF="sbe20017.htm#fr_143">70:3</A> On the use of Telaka, compare Mah&acirc;vagga VI, 13, I, and Sittha-telaka at <I>K</I>ullavagga IV, 3, 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_139"></A><A HREF="sbe20017.htm#fr_144">70:4</A> Compare <I>K</I>ullavagga X, 10, 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_140"></A><A HREF="sbe20017.htm#fr_145">71:1</A> All these practices are seriatim forbidden to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s also in <I>K</I>ullavagga X, 10, 3.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_141"></A><A HREF="sbe20017.htm#fr_146">71:2</A> The following section recurs, almost word for word, of the Bhikkhun&icirc;s, in the Bhikkhun&icirc;-vibha&#7749;ga, P&acirc;<I>k</I>ittiya X (Sutta-vibha&#7749;ga, vol. ii, p. 267).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_142"></A><A HREF="sbe20017.htm#fr_147">71:3</A> Giragga-sama<I>g</I><I>g</I>a. Compare D&icirc;pava<I>m</I>sa XXI, 32, and Mah&acirc;va<I>m</I>sa, p. 214, line 2. It occurs also in the Introductory Story in the Sutta-vibha&#7749;ga on the 37th P&acirc;<I>k</I>ittiya, and Buddhaghosa there explains it as follows: Giragga-sama<I>g</I><I>g</I>o ti girimhi agga-sama<I>g</I><I>g</I>o girissa v&acirc; agga-dese sama<I>g</I><I>g</I>o. He is evidently in doubt about the word, which is probably connected with ancient local worship or custom, a worship in high-places, as little allied to Vedic Brahmanism as it was to Buddhism.</P>
