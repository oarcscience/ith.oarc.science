### 5.

1\. Now Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî went to the Blessed One \[&c., as
before\], and said: 'May the Blessed One preach to me the Dhamma (truth,
doctrine) in abstract; so that, having heard the doctrine of the Blessed
One, I may remain alone and separate, earnest, zealous, and
resolved <span id="fr_878"></span>[1](#fn_864).'

'Of whatsoever doctrines thou shalt be conscious, Gotamî, that they
conduce to passion and not to peace, to pride and not to veneration, to
wishing for much and not to wishing for little, to love of society and
not to seclusion, to sloth and not to the exercise of zeal, to being
hard to satisfy and not to content <span
id="fr_879"></span>[2](#fn_865)--verily mayest thou then, Gotamî, bear
in mind

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

that that is not Dhamma, that that is not Vinaya, that that is not the
teaching of the Master. But of whatsoever doctrines thou shalt be
conscious, Gotamî, that they conduce to peace and not to passion, to
veneration and not to pride, to wishing for little and not to wishing
for much, to seclusion and not to love of society, to the exercise of
zeal and not to sloth, to content and not to querulousness--verily
mayest thou then bear in mind that that is Dhamma, and that is Vinaya,
and that the teaching of the Master.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_864"></span>[329:1](sbe20096.htm#fr_878) These last words
are the standing expression for the preparatory stage to Arahatship.
Compare Mahâvagga I, 6, 16; Mahâ-parinibbâna Sutta V, 68. The whole
speech frequently occurs in the Sa*m*yutta Nikâya at the commencement of
conversations with the Buddha.

<span id="fn_865"></span>[329:2](sbe20096.htm#fr_879) Most of these
terms have already occurred in the standing 'religious discourse' which
is related to have preceded the enunciation of so many of the rules for
Bhikkhus (*K*ullavagga I, 2, 3).
