### 28.

1\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus laid up much store of
brass ware and copper ware.

People who came on a visit to the Vihâras, seeing it, murmured, &c.,
saying, 'Like those who spread out copper (for sale) <span
id="fr_369"></span>[3](#fn_362.md).'

They told this matter to the blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to lay up much store of brass ware and copper
ware. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a <span
id="fr_370"></span>[4](#fn_363.md).'

2\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus were afraid to use boxes to put
eye-ointment in <span id="fr_371"></span>[1](#fn_364.md), and little flat
sticks to lay it on with <span id="fr_372"></span>[2](#fn_365.md), and
instruments for removing wax from the ear <span
id="fr_373"></span>[3](#fn_366.md), and handles (for razors, staves,
&c.) <span id="fr_374"></span>[4](#fn_367.md).

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of these things.'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus sat down lolling up against
their waist-cloths (arranged as a cushion) <span
id="fr_375"></span>[5](#fn_368.md), and the edges of the waist-cloths wore
out <span id="fr_376"></span>[6](#fn_369.md).

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to loll in this way. Whosoever does so, shall
be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu was sick, and without some
handicraft <span id="fr_377"></span>[7](#fn_370.md) he was ill at ease.

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a loom, and of shuttles, strings,
tickets, and all the apparatus belonging to a loom.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_360"></span>[140:1](sbe20042.htm#fr_367.md) Sa*nd*âsa. So at
*G*âtaka I, 138, 4, a barber pulls out a white hair from the king's
head, suva*nn*a-sa*nd*âsena.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[140:2](sbe20042.htm#fr_368.md) This license
is-repeated in the next chapter.

<span id="fn_362"></span>[140:3](sbe20043.htm#fr_369.md) Ka*m*sa-pattharikâ
tî ka*m*sa-bha*nd*a-vâ*n*igâ (B.).

<span id="fn_363"></span>[140:4](sbe20043.htm#fr_370.md) They might have
all kinds of brass ware, except certain articles, according to chapter
37 below.

<span id="fn_364"></span>[141:1](sbe20043.htm#fr_371.md) A*ñg*ani*m*. The
use of these has been already allowed at Mahâvagga VI, 12, I, 2, 4.

<span id="fn_365"></span>[141:2](sbe20043.htm#fr_372.md) In the text read
a*ñg*ana-salâka*m*, on which see Mahâvagga VI, 12, 3, 4.

<span id="fn_366"></span>[141:3](sbe20043.htm#fr_373.md) Already allowed in
the last chapter.

<span id="fn_367"></span>[141:4](sbe20043.htm#fr_374.md) Bandhana-mattan ti
vâsi-kattara-ya*tth*i-âdîna*m* vâ bandhanamatta*m* (B.). It is clear
from this note, and the repetition of the pi in the text, that we have
to do here with a special object, and not a mere qualification of the
other three.

<span id="fn_368"></span>[141:5](sbe20043.htm#fr_375.md)
Sa*m*ghâ*t*i-pallatthikâya nisîditvâ. See IV, 4, 7 at the end, and the
Old Commentary on the 26th Sekhiya. Childers translates it as if it were
the same as ukku*t*ika*m* nisîditvâ; but it must be different from it as
that was allowed and constantly practised.

<span id="fn_369"></span>[141:6](sbe20043.htm#fr_376.md) Pa*tt*â
lu*gg*anti. So read (not pattâ as in the text) in accordance with our
note 3 on Mahâvagga VIII, 21, I. The second word occurs also above, V,
16, 2; 17, 2. From this passage here it is probable that a*tth*a-pâdaka
at Mahâvagga VIII, 21, means a stool.

<span id="fn_370"></span>[141:7](sbe20043.htm#fr_377.md) Âyoga*m*. Compare
the Sutta-vibhaṅga, Pâ*k*ittiya LXXXVIII, 2, 2; *G*âtaka III, 447, 6.
