### 16.

1\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus had come into the possession of some
bedding, and the Bhikkhunîs had none. The Bhikkhunîs sent a messenger to
the Bhikkhus, saying: 'It would be well if their reverences the Bhikkhus
would give us some bedding on loan <span
id="fr_914"></span>[1](#fn_900.md).'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to give bedding to the Bhikkhunîs on loan.'

2\. Now at that time Bhikkhunîs, in their courses, sat down or lay down
on stuffed bedsteads and chairs, and the stuffing was soiled with blood.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to sit down or lie down on a stuffed
bedstead or chair. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I
allow the use, O Bhikkhus, of an indoor's robe <span
id="fr_915"></span>[2](#fn_901.md).'

The indoor's robe got soiled.

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a thigh-cloth (a cloth to reach nearly
down to the knee <span id="fr_916"></span>[1](#fn_902).md).'

The thigh-cloth slipped down.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow it, O Bhikkhus, to be fastened by a thread to be tied round the
thigh.'

The thread broke.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a loin-cloth, and a string going round the hips
(to keep it up) <span id="fr_917"></span>[2](#fn_903.md).'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhunîs used to wear the
hip-string always. The people murmured, &c., saying: 'Like the women who
still enjoy the pleasures of the world!' They told this matter to the
Blessed One.

'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to wear a hip-string for constant
use <span id="fr_918"></span>[3](#fn_904.md). I allow its use to one who is
in her courses.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_900"></span>[347:1](sbe20107.htm#fr_914.md) Tâvakâlika*m*. See
the passages quoted in our note above on *K*ullavagga VI, 18.

<span id="fn_901"></span>[347:2](sbe20107.htm#fr_915.md)
Âvasatha-*k*îvara*m*. See the Old Commentary on this word as occurring
in the 47th Bhikkhunî Pâ*k*ittiya.

<span id="fn_902"></span>[348:1](sbe20107.htm#fr_916.md) Â*n*i-*k*olaka*m*.
Buddhaghosa has no note on this. Â*n*i must be here 'that part of the
leg immediately above the knee, the front of the thigh.' Compare
Böhtlingk-Roth s.v. No. 2.

<span id="fn_903"></span>[348:2](sbe20107.htm#fr_917.md) Sa*m*velliya*m*
ka*t*i-suttaka*m*. The sa*m*velliya*m* is the ordinary undress as worn
for the sake of decency, even now, by a labourer working in muddy paddy
fields, or at any severe task. It is a wedge-shaped strip of cotton
cloth about a foot and a half long, about five inches wide at one end,
and tapering down to one inch in width at the other. The broad end is
fixed on to a string going round the waist (*k*a*t*i-suttaka*m*), and
hangs down, when put on, in front of the legs. When worn under other
clothes, it remains so; but when the other clothes are taken off for
work the narrow end is passed under the body between the legs, and
twisted round the hip-string behind (at the small of the back) so as to
keep it fast. Its use is forbidden to Bhikkhus at V, 29, 5, where
Buddhaghosa says, 'Such as wrestlers and labourers wear.'

<span id="fn_904"></span>[348:3](sbe20107.htm#fr_918.md) Its use is also
forbidden to Bhikkhus (above, *K*ullavagga V 2, 1).
