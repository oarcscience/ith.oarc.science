<p>1. Now at that time the mangoes were ripe in the park of Seniya Bimbis&acirc;ra, the king of Magadha. And Seniya Bimbis&acirc;ra, the king of Magadha, had given command, saying,' Let the venerable ones have as much fruit as they like.' Then the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus plucked even the young fruits and ate them.</p>  
<p>Now Seniya Bimbis&acirc;ra, the king of Magadha, wanted a mango; and he gave orders, saying, 'Go,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A></p>  
<p>my good men, to the park, and bring me hither a mango.'</p>  
<p>'Even so, Lord,' said the men in assent to Seniya Bimbis&acirc;ra, the king of Magadha and they went to the park, and said to the park-keepers, 'Our lord, good friends, has need of a mango. Give us one!'</p>  
<p>'There are no mangoes, Sirs. The Bhikkhus have plucked even the young ones, and eaten them.'</p>  
<p>Then those men told the matter to Seniya Bimbis&acirc;ra, the king of Magadha, and he said: 'The mangoes have been well used, my good men, by the venerable ones. Notwithstanding it is moderation that has been exalted by the Blessed One.'</p>  
<p>The people murmured, were shocked, and were indignant, &amp;c., saying, 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama<I>n</I>as, knowing no moderation, use up the king's mangoes?' The Bhikkhus heard those men murmuring, shocked, and indignant. Then those Bhikkhus told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to eat mangoes. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>2. Now at that time it was the turn of a certain multitude to provide the Sa<I>m</I>gha with a meal. Mango-peal was put into the curry. The Bhikkhus, fearing to offend, would not partake of it.</p>  
<p>'Take it, O Bhikkhus, and eat. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to eat the peal of the mango.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time it was the turn of a certain multitude to provide the Sa<I>m</I>gha with a meal. They did not get so far as to make (curry with) the peal, but went about in the dining-hall with whole mangoes. The Bhikkhus, fearing to offend, would not accept them.</p>
