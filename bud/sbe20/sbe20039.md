### 24.

1\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu tied his bowl with a string, and
suspending it on a staff <span id="fr_347"></span>[1](#fn_340.md), went
after noon out of a certain village gate. The people calling out, 'There
goes a thief; his sword is glistening,' fell upon him, and seized him.
But on recognising him, they let him go. That Bhikkhu, returning to the
Ârâma, told this matter to the Bhikkhus.

'What then, Sir,. did you carry a staff with a string to it?'

'It is even so, Sirs.'

Those Bhikkhus who were moderate murmured (&c., as usual, see I, 1, 2,
3) . . . . told the Blessed One . . . . he addressed the Bhikkhus, and
said:

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to carry a staff with a string to it.
Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

2\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu was sick, and he could not wander
about without a staff. They told this matter to the Blessed One.

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to give to a sick Bhikkhu the permission
(license) to use a staff. And thus, O Bhikkhus, should it be given. That
sick Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, should go up to the Sa*m*gha \[here follow the
words of a Kammavâ*k*â, precisely as in V, 20, 7\]'

3\. \[Similar paragraphs ending with Kammavâ*k*âs for license to lift
the bowl with a string, and with both a staff and a string.\]
