### 21.

1\. Now when the Blessed One had remained at Â*l*avî as long as he
thought fit, he set out on his journey towards Râ*g*agaha. And
proceeding straight on, he arrived in due course at Râ*g*agaha. And
there, at Râ*g*agaha, the Blessed One stayed at the Ve*l*uvana in the
Kalandaka Nivâpa.

Now at that time there was a scarcity of food at Râ*g*agaha <span
id="fr_629"></span>[1](#fn_619). The people were unable to provide food
for the (whole) Sa*m*gha and they were desirous of providing food <span
id="fr_630"></span>[2](#fn_620) (to be sent to the Vihâra) for the use
of a special Bhikkhu (designated by the donor) <span
id="fr_631"></span>[3](#fn_621) or for special Bhikkhus invited (by the
donor in his own house) <span id="fr_632"></span>[4](#fn_622) or for
(single Bhikkhus) appointed by ticket (issued by the Sa*m*gha) <span
id="fr_633"></span>[5](#fn_623), or of providing food during a
fortnight <span id="fr_634"></span>[6](#fn_624), or on Uposatha

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

days (that is, on the last days of each fortnight) or on the first days
of each fortnight.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, each of three ways of obtaining food.'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus having received good food
for themselves, gave over the worse food (which they had also received)
to the other Bhikkhus.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to appoint as apportioner of rations <span
id="fr_635"></span>[1](#fn_625) a Bhikkhu who is possessed of the
following five qualifications--(&c., as in IV, 9, down to the end of the
Kammavâ*k*â):

Now the Bhikkhus who were apportioners of rations, thought: 'How then
are the rations to be apportioned?'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you. O Bhikkhus, to apportion them by arranging the food in
small heaps, and fastening tickets or marks upon them <span
id="fr_636"></span>[2](#fn_626).'

2\. Now at that time the Sa*m*gha had no distributor

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

of lodging-places--no overseer of stores--no receiver of robes--no
distributor of robes, of congey, or of fruits--and no distributor of dry
foods, and through not being distributed it went bad.

They told each of these matters <span id="fr_637"></span>[1](#fn_627) to
the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to appoint as distributor of lodging-places,
&c., a Bhikkhu who has (&c., as in § 1, down to the end of the
Kammavâ*k*â, inserting throughout the appropriate variations in the
fifth qualification).

3\. Now at that time articles of trifling value had accumulated in the
storehouse of the Sa*m*gha.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to appoint as disposer of trifles a Bhikkhu
who has (&c., as before, down to the end of the Kammavâ*k*â). Each
separate needle, and pair of scissors, and pair of sandals, and girdle,
and pair of braces, and filtering cloth, and regulation strainer <span
id="fr_638"></span>[2](#fn_628), and plait <span
id="fr_639"></span>[3](#fn_629), and half-plait <span
id="fr_640"></span>[3](#fn_629), and gusset <span
id="fr_641"></span>[3](#fn_629), and half-gusset <span
id="fr_642"></span>[3](#fn_629), and binding <span
id="fr_643"></span>[4](#fn_630), and braiding <span
id="fr_644"></span>[4](#fn_630), is to be given away. If the Sa*m*gha
has any ghee, or oil, or honey, or molasses, he is to give it away for
personal consumption only, and if it be wanted, he is to give it a
second and a third time <span id="fr_645"></span>[5](#fn_631).'

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

Now at that time the Sa*m*gha had no receiver of under-garments <span
id="fr_646"></span>[1](#fn_632), or of bowls,--no superintendent of
those who kept the grounds in order (the Ârâmikas), and the Ârâmikas not
being looked after, the necessary work was not done,--no superintendent
of sâma*n*eras, and the sâma*n*eras not being looked after did not
perform their duties.

They told each of these matters to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to appoint as receiver of under-garments, &c.,
a Bhikkhu who has (&c., as before, down to the end of the Kammavâ*k*â).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_619"></span>[220:1](sbe20073.htm#fr_629) Other special
rules for times of scarcity will be found at Mahâvagga VI, 17, 7; 18, 4;
19, 2; 20, 4 (repealed for times of plenty in VI, 32). Compare also
Pârâ*g*ika IV, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_620"></span>[220:2](sbe20073.htm#fr_630) The above modes of
receiving food (instead of collecting in a bowl morsels of food given in
alms) are the dispensations allowed by Mahâvagga I, 30, 4.

<span id="fn_621"></span>[220:3](sbe20073.htm#fr_631) Uddesa-bhatta*m*
*k*âtu*m*. Compare the story of Upananda at Mahâvagga VI, 19, I.

<span id="fn_622"></span>[220:4](sbe20073.htm#fr_632) Nimantana*m*
kâtu*m*. The word is only used in this special technical sense. Compare
the whole story of *K*ulla-panthaka at *G*âtaka I, 116, and especially
the last line.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[220:5](sbe20073.htm#fr_633) Salâka-bhatta*m*
*k*âtu*m*. See especially above, *K*ullavagga IV, 9; IV, to.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[220:6](sbe20073.htm#fr_634) Pakkhika*m*
*k*âtu*m*. Both Childers sub voce and Frankfurter <span id="page_221">p.
221</span> ('Pali Handbook,' p. 165), in interpreting the passage at
Mahâvagga I, 30, 4, take this to mean a feast given on the eighth day of
the month. But paksha is the half-month. The expression much more
probably means, therefore, to provide food either during the whole of a
half-month for one or more specially invited Bhikkhus, or for a larger
number on any one day of the half-month to be chosen by the Sa*m*gha.

<span id="fn_625"></span>[221:1](sbe20073.htm#fr_635) Compare above,
*K*ullavagga IV, 4, 1.

<span id="fn_626"></span>[221:2](sbe20073.htm#fr_636) Buddhaghosa says,
Salâkâya vâ pa*t*ikâya vâ upanibandhitvâ opu*ñkh*itvâ uddisitun ti
va*k*anato rukkhasâramayâya salâkâya vâ ve*l*uvilivatâlapa*nn*âdinayâya
pa*t*ikâya vâ asukassa nâma salâkabhattan ti eva*m* akkharâni
upanibandhitvâ pa*kkh*iya*m* vâ *k*îvarabhoge vâ katvâ sabbâ salâkâyo
omu*ñkh*itvâ \[sic\] punappuna*m* he*tth*â-vasena â*l*oletvâ . . .
dâtabbâ.

<span id="fn_627"></span>[222:1](sbe20073.htm#fr_637) There is another
officer (âsana-pa*ññ*âpaka) mentioned at *K*ullavagga XII, 2, 7, whose
omission from the list here is worthy of notice.

<span id="fn_628"></span>[222:2](sbe20073.htm#fr_638) Dhamma-karako. See
V, 13, I.

<span id="fn_629"></span>[222:3](sbe20073.htm#fr_642) On these words,
see Mahâvagga VIII, 12, 2.

<span id="fn_630"></span>[222:4](sbe20073.htm#fr_644) On these two
words, see Mahâvagga VIII, 1, 5.

<span id="fn_631"></span>[222:5](sbe20073.htm#fr_645) These things were
to be used only as medicines, according to Mahâvagga VI, 1, 1-5, where
butter is also added. That would be under the charge of the distributor
of dry foods (§ 2), as if kept it would go bad. According to VI, 15, 10,
none of these five <span id="page_222">p. 222</span> kinds of medicine
were to be kept for a period exceeding seven days, but that was a rule
that was not very probable to be strictly followed.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[223:1](sbe20073.htm#fr_646) Sâ*t*iya; no doubt
the same as is spelt elsewhere sâ*t*ikâ or sâ*t*akâ, and is used for
such purposes as bathing in.
