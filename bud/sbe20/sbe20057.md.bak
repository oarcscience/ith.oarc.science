### 5.

1\. Now when the Blessed One had stayed at Râ*g*agaha as long as he
thought fit, he set out towards Vesâlî; and journeying straight on he in
due course arrived there. And there at Vesâlî the Blessed One stayed in
the peak-roofed hall at the Mahâvana.

Now at that time the people were zealously engaged in putting up new
buildings (for the use of the Order) <span
id="fr_556"></span>[5](#fn_546.md), and as zealously provided with the

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

requisite clothes, and food, and lodging, and medicine for the sick, all
such Bhikkhus as superintended their work.

Now a certain poor tailor thought; 'This can be no every-day matter on
which the people are so zealously engaged. Let me too set to work on a
new building.' And that poor tailor himself kneaded the clay, and laid
the bricks, and raised the walls. But by his want of experience the
laying was out of line and the wall fell down. And a second and a third
time he \[repeated his work, and with the same result\].

2\. Then that poor tailor murmured, was annoyed, and became indignant,
saying, 'These Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as exhort and teach those men who
provide them with the requisite clothes, food, lodging, and medicine,
and superintend their buildings for them. But I am poor, and no one
exhorts or teaches me, or helps me in my building!'

The Bhikkhus heard him so murmuring, and told the matter to the Blessed
One. Then the Blessed One on that occasion and in that connection made a
religious discourse, and gave command to the Bhikkhus, saying, 'I permit
you, O Bhikkhus, to give new buildings in course of erection (for the
use of the Order) in charge (to a Bhikkhu who shall superintend <span
id="fr_557"></span>[1](#fn_547) the work.md). And the Bhikkhu who

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

is overseer shall zealously exert himself to the end that the work on
the Vihâra may be brought to a rapid conclusion, and shall afterwards
cause repairs to be executed wherever the buildings have become broken
or worn out <span id="fr_558"></span>[1](#fn_548.md).

3\. 'And thus, O Bhikkhus, is the work to be given in charge. In the
first place a Bhikkhu is to be asked (whether he will undertake the
duty). When he has been asked, some able and discreet Bhikkhu is to lay
the matter before the Sa*m*gha, saying, "Let the venerable Sa*m*gha hear
me. If the time seems meet to the Sa*m*gha, let the Sa*m*gha give in
charge to such and such a Bhikkhu the Vihâra of such and such a
householder as a navakamma*m*. This is the motion (*ñ*atti). Let the
venerable Sa*m*gha hear me. The Sa*m*gha hereby gives in charge . . . .
(&c., as before). Whosoever of the venerable ones approves thereof, let
him keep silence; whosoever approves not thereof, let him speak. The
Sa*m*gha has given in charge . . . . (&c., as before). Therefore is it
silent. Thus do I understand."'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_546"></span>[189:5](sbe20057.htm#fr_556.md) Navakamma*m*
karonti. This idiom always connotes buildings for the use of the Order.
See the passages quoted in our note on *K*ullavagga I, 18, I. If the
buildings were for the Bhikkhus, then a Bhikkhu, if for the Bhikkhunîs,
then a Bhikkhunî, was appointed to superintend the works in order to
ensure the <span id="page_190">p. 190</span> buildings being in
accordance with the rules of the Order as to size, form, and object of
the various apartments.

The buildings referred to in this section are no doubt intended to be
the same as those referred to in *K*ullavagga V, 13, 3.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[190:1](sbe20057.htm#fr_557.md) Navakamma*m*
dâtu*m*. For the works which ought not to be included, and for those
which might be lawfully included. in this term, see below, *K*ullavagga
VI, 17. Hence the overseer is called navakammika.
