### 8.

1\. Now at that time people arranged in the eating-rooms, or in the
interior courtyards of their houses, lofty and large couches, such as
\[here follows the list of things forbidden in Mahâvagga V, 10, 4\]. The
Bhikkhus, fearing to offend, would not sit down upon them.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to sit down on seats arranged by
laymen--excepting three, (that is to say) large cushions, divans,
mattresses <span id="fr_572"></span>[1](#fn_562.md)--but not to lie down
upon them.'

Now at that time people put in the eating-rooms, or in the courtyards,
stuffed couches and stuffed chairs. The Bhikkhus, fearing to offend,
would not sit down on them.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to sit down on any \[such\] things arranged by
laymen, but not to lie down upon them <span
id="fr_573"></span>[2](#fn_563.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_562"></span>[197:1](sbe20060.htm#fr_572.md) These are Nos. 1,
2, and 7 in the list just referred to, and may be kept if treated in the
way laid down in VI, 14, 2 below.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[197:2](sbe20060.htm#fr_573.md) This rule has
already occurred in identical terms at Mahâvagga V, 11. Probably both
here and there the word such, which we have here added in brackets, is
to be understood.
