### 15.

1\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus, when naked <span
id="fr_283"></span>[2](#fn_277), saluted one another, and received
salutes; did service to one another, and received services; gave to one
another, and accepted; ate, both hard food and soft; tasted; and drank.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'A man, O Bhikkhus, when naked, is not to give salutations, nor receive
them; is not to do services, nor to accept them <span
id="fr_284"></span>[3](#fn_278); is not to give, nor to receive; is not
to eat either hard or soft; is not to taste; is not to drink. Whosoever
does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_277"></span>[110:2](sbe20030.htm#fr_283) That is, while in
the *G*antâghara, which explains the otherwise inexplicable fact of this
chapter being inserted here instead of at the commencement of 16. 2.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[110:3](sbe20030.htm#fr_284) In Mahâvagga I,
25, 13, services are to be rendered to a Bhikkhu who is in the bath.
This is permitted by 16. 2 below.
