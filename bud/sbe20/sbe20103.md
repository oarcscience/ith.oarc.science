### 12.

1\. Now at that time a certain woman, who had formerly belonged to the
clan of the Mallas <span id="fr_912"></span>[2](#fn_898) had entered the
Order of the Bhikkhunîs. She, seeing a weakly Bhikkhu on the road,
struck up against him with the edge of her shoulder, and knocked him
over. The Bhikkhus murmured, were indignant, and complained, saying:
'How can a Bhikkhunî assault a Bhikkhu?'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to assault a

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

Bhikkhu. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I prescribe
that a Bhikkhunî, O Bhikkhus, on seeing a Bhikkhu, should get out of the
way when still at a distance, and make room for him.'
