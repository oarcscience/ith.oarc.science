### 19.

1\. Now at that time the Bhikkhunîs did not hold Pavâra*n*â.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to omit holding Pavâra*n*â. Whosoever
does so, shall be dealt with according to law <span
id="fr_930"></span>[1](#fn_916.md).'

Now at that time the Bhikkhunîs held Pavâra*n*â by themselves, and not
in the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to hold Pavâra*n*â apart, and not in
the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha. Whosoever does so, shall be dealt with according
to law <span id="fr_931"></span>[2](#fn_917.md).'

Now at that time Bhikkhunîs holding Pavâra*n*â with the Bhikkhus only,
and not apart by themselves, disturbed (the meeting of the
Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha).

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to hold Pavâra*n*â with the
Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha only. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty oft
dukka*t*a <span id="fr_932"></span>[2](#fn_917.md).'

Now at that time Bhikkhunîs spent all their time

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

before noon holding Pavâra*n*â \[and so had no time left for the early
meal\].

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that they hold Pavâra*n*â in the afternoon.'

When holding Pavâra*n*â in the afternoon, they had not time enough \[to
conclude their own ceremony that day, and take part in that of the
Bhikkhus\].

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow them, O Bhikkhus, to hold their own Pavâra*n*â one day, and
that with the Bhikkhus the next day.'

2\. Now at that time the whole of the Bhikkhunî-sa*m*gha declaring, each
one for herself, her Pavâra*n*â before the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha, disturbed
(the proceedings).

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that some one learned and competent Bhikkhunî
be deputed to make the Pavâra*n*â invitation on behalf of the
Bhikkhunî-sa*m*gha before the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha. And thus, O Bhikkhus, is
she to be deputed:

'"First, the Bhikkhunî is to be asked (whether she be willing to serve).
When that has been done, a learned and discreet Bhikkhunî is to lay this
motion before the Sa*m*gha: Let the Sa*m*gha, venerable Ladies, hear me.
If it seem meet to the Sa*m*gha, let the Sa*m*gha depute N. N. to make
the Pavâra*n*â invitation on behalf of the Bhikkhunî-sa*m*gha before the
Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha. That is the motion.

'"Let the Sa*m*gha, venerable Ladies, hear me. The Sa*m*gha deputes N.
N. to make the Pavâra*n*â invitation on behalf of the Bhikkhunî-sa*m*gha
before the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha. Whosoever of the venerable

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

ones approves thereof, let her keep silence. Whosoever approves not
thereof, let her speak.

'"N. N. is deputed by the Sa*m*gha to make the Pavâra*n*â invitation on
behalf of the Bhikkhunî-sa*m*gha before the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha. The
Sa*m*gha approves thereof. Therefore is it silent. Thus do I
understand."'

3\. 'When that Bhikkhunî has been deputed, she, accompanied by the
Bhikkhunî-sa*m*gha, is to go before the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha, arrange her
robe over one shoulder, bow down before the Bhikkhus, and sitting on her
heels, to stretch forth her joined palms, and say: "The
Bhikkhunî-sa*m*gha invites the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha (to point out to them
any faults they may have committed) in respect of things heard, or seen,
or suspected. May the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha speak to the Bhikkhunî-sa*m*gha
(if there be anything wherein they have offended) out of compassion
toward them. Then will they, if they perceive the offence, confess the
same. And a second time the Bhikkhunî-sa*m*gha . . . . . . \[the whole
repeated\]. And a third time . . . . . . \[the whole repeated\] <span

<span id="fn_918"></span>[358:1](sbe20110.htm#fr_933.md) This, of course,
is the same form that each separate member of the Order uses before his
or her own Sa*m*gha. Compare our notes above on the corresponding
passage in the Mahâvagga, IV, I, 4.
