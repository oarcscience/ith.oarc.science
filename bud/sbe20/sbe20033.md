from the mats on which they sat down for four months <span

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to separate yourselves for four months from
the mats on which you sit

down. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus lay down to sleep on beds
scattered over with flowers.

People who came on a visit to the Vihâras saw it, and murmured, &c.,
saying, 'Like those who still live in the pleasures of the world.'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to sleep on beds scattered over with flowers.
Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time people came to the Ârâma, bringing perfumes and
garlands. The Bhikkhus, fearing to offend, would not accept them.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus; to accept the perfume, and to apply it to the
door for a space of five finger-breadths <span
id="fr_308"></span>[1](#fn_302); and to accept the flowers, and put them
on one side in the Vihâra.'
