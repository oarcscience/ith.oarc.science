# FIFTH KHANDHAKA.

#### ON THE DAILY LIFE OF THE BHIKKHUS.

### 1.

1\. Now at that time the Blessed One was staying at Râ*g*agaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, in the Kalandaka Nivâpa. And at that time the
*Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus, when bathing, used to rub <span
id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_120.md) their bodies--thighs, and arms, and
breast, and back--against wood. The people were annoyed, murmured, and
became indignant, saying, 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as do so,
like wrestlers, boxers, or shampooers <span
id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_121.md)?' The Bhikkhus heard the people so
murmuring, &c.; and they told the matter to the Blessed One.

Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, having
convened a meeting of the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha, asked the Bhikkhus: 'Is this
true, O Bhikkhus, what they say, that the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus, when
bathing, rub (&c., as before)?'

'It is true, Lord.'

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

The Blessed Buddha rebuked them, saying, 'This is improper, O Bhikkhus
(&c., as usual, see I, 1, 2, down to the end).' And when he had rebuked
them, and had delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the
Bhikkhus, and said: 'A Bhikkhu, when bathing, is not, O Bhikkhus, to rub
his body against wood. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a
dukka*t*a.'

2\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus: when bathing, used to
rub their bodies--thighs, and arms, and breast, and back--against a
pillar--against a wall (&c., as in last section, down to the end).

3\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to bathe on an
A*tt*âna (a sort of shampooing stand <span
id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_122)). The people (&c., as before.md). The
Bhikkhus (&c., as before). Then the Blessed One (&c., as before, down
to) addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'You are not to bathe, O Bhikkhus,
on an A*tt*âna. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

\[Paragraphs similar in every respect to the last follow as to

Using a Gandhabba-hatthaka <span id="fr_126"></span>[2](#fn_123.md) when
bathing.

Using a Kuruvindaka-sutti <span id="fr_127"></span>[3](#fn_124.md) when
bathing.

Rubbing their bodies, when under water, up against each other <span
id="fr_128"></span>[4](#fn_125.md).

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

Using a Mallaka <span id="fr_129"></span>[1](#fn_126.md) when bathing.\]

4\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had the scab, and he could not
bathe with comfort without a Mallaka <span
id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_126.md).

They told the matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, to a sick man the use of a Mallaka not
(artificially) made <span id="fr_131"></span>[2](#fn_127.md).'

5\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu who was weak through old age was
not able to shampoo his own body.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of an Ukkâsika <span
id="fr_132"></span>[3](#fn_128.md).

Now at that time the Bhikkhus, (fearing to offend against these rules,)
were afraid to shampoo one another.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the ordinary mode of shampooing with the
hand <span id="fr_133"></span>[4](#fn_129.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_120"></span>[66:1](sbe20016.htm#fr_123.md) Uggha*m*seti. The
simple verb occurs below, V, 9, 2, 4, X, 10, 2, and at *G*âtaka, vol. i,
p. 190. It is the Sanskrit root gharsh.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[66:2](sbe20016.htm#fr_124.md) On malla-mu*tth*ikâ
Buddhaghosa merely says mu*tth*ika-mallâ. His note on gâma-poddavâ
(already given by H.O. at p. 3.15 of the edition to the text) says,
'town’s people given to adorning themselves by painting their skin' (on
which compare below, V, 2, 5). But it is difficult to see how that fits
in with the connection here.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[67:1](sbe20016.htm#fr_125.md) So Buddhaghosa loc.
cit.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[67:2](sbe20016.htm#fr_126.md) A wooden instrument
in the shape of a hand, which was firs; covered with chunam (fine lime),
and then rubbed over the body. See Buddhaghosa's note at p. 315 of
H.O.'s edition of the text.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[67:3](sbe20016.htm#fr_127.md) Apparently a string
of beads which was first covered with the chunam made from Kuruvindaka
stone (a ruby-coloured stone), and then held at both ends and rubbed
over the body. See Buddhaghosa's note loc. cit.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[67:4](sbe20016.htm#fr_128.md) As Buddhaghosa,
loc. cit., explains this by 'rubbing their <span id="page_68">p.
68</span> bodies up against each other'(!), vigayha has here probably
nothing to do with gâh, but is simply vig*ri*hya.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[68:1](sbe20016.htm#fr_130.md) A kind of
back-scratcher, made according to Buddhaghosa, loc. cit., by placing
together, by the roots, hooks made of the teeth of crocodiles
(makara-dantaka; see V, 11, 6; VI, 3, 2), which had previously been
split. Such hooks of split crocodiles' teeth are mentioned in the text
itself below, V, 9, 2; and pins or hooks made of raga's teeth at V, 9,
5, and VI, 3, 5 (nâga-dantaka), and V, It, 7 (nâga-danta).

<span id="fn_127"></span>[68:2](sbe20016.htm#fr_131.md) Buddhaghosa, loc.
cit., makes this phrase mean only 'made of teeth that had not been
previously split.'

<span id="fn_128"></span>[68:3](sbe20016.htm#fr_132.md) Buddhaghosa, loc.
cit., explains this word by vattova*tt*i; which is to us equally
unintelligible.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[68:4](sbe20016.htm#fr_133.md) Pudhu-pâ*n*ikan ti
hattha-parikamma*m* vu*kk*ati. Tasmâ sabbesa*m* hatthena
pi*tth*i-parikamma*m* kâtu*m* va*tt*ati (B.).
