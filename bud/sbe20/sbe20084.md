### 6.

1: Now at that time a number of Bhikkhus dwelt in the woods; and they
provided neither drinking-water, nor water for washing, nor fire, nor
drill sticks nor tinder (for starting a fire) <span
id="fr_824"></span>[2](#fn_810.md); nor did they know the stations of the
constellations, nor the divisions of the (ten) 'directions' (of the
sky).

Thieves went there and said to the Bhikkhus, 'Have you, Sirs, got
drinking-water?'

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

'No, friends, we have not.'

'Have you, Sirs, got water for washing?'

'No, friends, we have not.'

'Have you, Sirs, got fire?'

'No, friends, we have not.'

'Have you, Sirs, got sticks and tinder for producing fire?'

'No, friends, we have not.'

'With what (constellation is the moon now in) conjunction?'

'That, friends, we do not know.'

'Which direction is this?'

'That, friends, we do not know.'

\[On hearing these answers\] <span id="fr_825"></span>[1](#fn_811.md), the
thieves said, 'These are thieves. These men are no Bhikkhus.' And they
beat them, and went away.

The Bhikkhus told this matter to the Bhikkhus. The Bhikkhus told it to
the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that
connection, after delivering a religious discourse, said to the Bhikkhus

'Therefore, O Bhikkhus, do I establish a rule of conduct for Bhikkhus
dwelling in the woods, according to which they are to behave themselves
therein.

2\. 'A Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, who is dwelling in the woods, should rise
betimes, place his bowl in the bag <span
id="fr_826"></span>[2](#fn_812.md), hang it over his shoulder, arrange, his
upper robe over his back (over both shoulders) <span
id="fr_827"></span>[3](#fn_813.md), get on

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

his sandals, put the utensils of wood and earthenware in order, close
the doorway and lattice, and then leave his lodging-place.

'When he perceives that he is about to enter a village, he should take
off his sandals, turn them upside down <span
id="fr_828"></span>[1](#fn_814.md), beat them to get the dust out, put them
into a bag, hang it over his shoulder, put on his waistcloth \[and so on
as laid down for a Bhikkhu entering the village for alms above, VIII, 5,
2, paragraph 1, to the end\].

3\. 'On leaving a village he should put the bowl into its bag, hang it
over his shoulder, roll his robes up, put them on his head <span
id="fr_829"></span>[2](#fn_815.md), get on his sandals, and then go.

'A Bhikkhu living in the woods, O Bhikkhus, should keep drinking-water,
and water for washing, and fire, and drill sticks and tinder, and
walking staves ready. He should learn the stations (of the moon) in the
constellations, either in the whole or in part, and he should know the
directions of the sky.

'This, O Bhikkhus, is the rule of conduct that I lay. down for Bhikkhus
dwelling in the woods, according to which they should behave themselves
therein.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_810"></span>[292:2](sbe20084.htm#fr_824.md) Ara*n*i-sahita*m*,
on which Buddhaghosa merely says ara*n*i-sahite sati aggi*m* kâtu*m* pi
va*tt*ati. In the *G*âtaka Commentary (I, 212, ed. Fausböll) we have the
phrase ara*n*i-sahita*m* nîharitvâ aggi*m* karonti. At p. 34 of the
Assalâyana Sutta (ed. Pischel) we hear of there being an upper and lower
stick to the ara*n*i; and at p. 53 of the Milinda Pa*ñ*ha (ed.
Trenckner) we find the same upper and lower sticks, the thong by which
to turn the latter, and the piece of rag for tinder mentioned as the
constituent parts of this ancient means of producing fire. The
expression in the text is probably a collective term for the whole of
these.

<span id="fn_811"></span>[293:1](sbe20084.htm#fr_825.md) They are all
repeated in the text.

<span id="fn_812"></span>[293:2](sbe20084.htm#fr_826.md) Thavikâ. This is
possibly one of the bags referred to in the permission granted by
Mahâvagga VIII, 20, but it was only to be used when the bowl had to be
carried a long distance, and not when passing through a village. (See
the beginning of the next section.)

<span id="fn_813"></span>[293:3](sbe20084.htm#fr_827.md) *K*îvara*m*
khandhe katvâ: either in contradistinction to <span id="page_294">p.
294</span> eka*m*sa*m* *k*îvara*m* katvâ (on which question there is a
great division among modern Buddhists. Compare Rh. D.'s note on the
Mahâ-parinibbâna Sutta VI, 47), or possibly 'put it in a roll on his
back.'

<span id="fn_814"></span>[294:1](sbe20084.htm#fr_828.md) On this
expression, see above, VIII, 1, 2.

<span id="fn_815"></span>[294:2](sbe20084.htm#fr_829.md) See Mahâvagga
VIII, 13, 1.
