# SEVENTH KHANDHAKA.

#### DISSENSIONS IN THE ORDER.

### 1 <span id="fr_647"></span>[1](#fn_633.md).

1\. Now at that time the Blessed One was staying at Anupiyâ <span
id="fr_648"></span>[2](#fn_634.md). Anupiyâ is a town belonging to the
Mallas <span id="fr_649"></span>[3](#fn_635.md). Now at that time the most
distinguished of the young men of the Sâkya clan had renounced the world
in imitation of the Blessed One.

Now there were two brothers, Mahânâma the Sâkyan, and Anuruddha the
Sâkyan. Anuruddha the Sâkyan was delicately nurtured; and he had three
storeyed residences, one for the cold season, one for the hot season,
and one for the season of the rains <span
id="fr_650"></span>[4](#fn_636.md). During the four months spent in the

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

residence for the season of the rains, he was waited upon by women
performing music <span id="fr_651"></span>[1](#fn_637.md), and came not
down from the upper storey of his residence.

Then Mahânâma the Sâkyan thought: 'Now the most distinguished of the
young men of the Sâkya clan have already renounced the world in
imitation of the Blessed One, but from our own family no one has gone
forth from the household life into the houseless state. Let therefore
either I, or Anuruddha, renounce the world.' And he went to Anuruddha
the Sâkyan, and said \[so to him, adding\], 'Either therefore do you go
forth, or I will do so.'

'I am delicate. It is impossible for me to go forth from the household
life into the houseless state. Do you do so.'

2\. 'But come now, O beloved Anuruddha, I will tell you what is incident
to the household life. First, you have to get your fields ploughed. When
that is done, you have to get them sown. When that is done, you have to
get the water led down over them. When that is done, you have to get the
water led off again. When that is done, you have to get the weeds pulled
up <span id="fr_652"></span>[2](#fn_638.md). When that is done, you have to
get the crop reaped. When that is done, you have to get the crop carried
away. When that is done, you have to get it arranged

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

into bundles. When that is done, you have to get it trodden out <span
id="fr_653"></span>[1](#fn_639.md). When that is done, you have to get the
straw picked out. When that is done, you have to get all the chaff
removed. When that is done, you have to get it winnowed. When that is
done, you have to get the harvest garnered <span
id="fr_654"></span>[2](#fn_640.md). When that is done, you have to do just
the same the next year, and the same all over again the year after that.

'The work is never over: one sees not the end of one's labours. O! when
shall our work be over? When shall we see the end of our labours? When
shall we, still possessing and retaining the pleasures of our five
senses, yet dwell at rest? Yes! the work, beloved Anuruddha, is never
over; no end appears to our labours. Even when our fathers and
forefathers had completed their time <span
id="fr_655"></span>[3](#fn_641.md), even then was their work unfinished.'

'Then do you take thought for the household duties. I will go forth from
the household life into the houseless state.'

And Anuruddha the Sâkyan went to his mother, and said to her: 'I want,
mother, to go forth from the household life into the houseless state.
Grant me thy permission to do so.'

And when he had thus spoken, his mother replied

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

to Anuruddha the Sâkyan, and said: 'You two, O beloved Anuruddha, are my
two only sons, near and dear to me, in whom I find no evil. Through
death I shall some day, against my will, be separated from you; but how
can I be willing, whilst you are still alive, that you should go forth
from the household life into the houseless state?'

\[And a second time Anuruddha the Sâkyan made the same request, and
received the same reply. And a third time Anuruddha the Sâkyan made the
same request to his mother.\]

3\. Now at that time Bhaddiya the Sâkya Râ*g*a held rule over the
Sâkyas; and he was a friend of Anuruddha the Sâkyan's. And the mother of
Anuruddha the Sâkyan, thinking that that being so, the Râ*g*a would not
be able to renounce the world, said to her son: 'If, beloved Anuruddha,
Bhaddiya the Sâkyan Râ*g*a will renounce the world, thou also mayest go
forth into the houseless state.'

Then Anuruddha the Sâkyan went to Bhaddiya the Sâkyan Raga, and said to
him: 'My renunciation of the world, dear friend, is being obstructed by
thee.'

'Then let that obstruction, dear friend, be removed. Even with thee will
I <span id="fr_656"></span>[1](#fn_642.md)--renounce thou the world
according to thy wish.'

'Come, dear friend, let us both renounce the world together!'

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

'I am not capable, dear friend, of giving up the household life.
Whatsoever else you can ask of me, that I will do <span
id="fr_657"></span>[1](#fn_643). Do you go forth (alone.md).'

'My mother, dear friend, has told me that if thou dost so, I may. And
thou hast even now declared "If thy renunciation be obstructed by me,
then let that obstruction be removed. Even with thee will I--renounce
thou the world, according to thy wish." Come, then, dear friend, let us
both renounce the world.'

Now at that time men were speakers of truth, and keepers of their word
which they had pledged. And Bhaddiya the Sâkya Râ*g*a said to Anuruddha
the Sâkyan: 'Wait, my friend, for seven years. At the end of seven years
we will renounce the world together.'

'Seven years are too long, dear friend. I am not able to wait for seven
years.'

\[And the same offer was made successively of six years and so on down
to one year, of seven months and so on down to one month, and even of a
fortnight, and still there was ever the same reply. At last the Râ*g*a
said,\]

'Wait, my friend, for seven days, whilst I hand over the kingdom to my
sons and my brothers.'

'Seven days is not too long. I will wait thus far' (was the reply).

4\. So Bhaddiya the Sâkya Râ*g*a, and Anuruddha, and Ânanda, and Bhagu,
and Kimbila, and Devadatta--just as they had so often previously gone

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

out to the pleasure-ground with fourfold array--even so did they now go
out with fourfold array, and Upâli the barber went with them, making
seven in all.

And when they had gone some distance, they sent their retinue back, and
crossed over into the neighbouring district, and took off their fine
things, and wrapped them in their robes, and made a bundle of them, and
said to Upâli the barber: 'Do you now, good Upâli, turn back. These
things will be sufficient for you to live upon.'

But as he was going back, Upâli the barber thought: 'The Sâkyas are
fierce. They will think that these young men have been brought by me to
destruction, and they will slay me. But since now these young men of the
Sâkya clan can go forth from the household life into the houseless
state, why indeed should not I?' And he let down the bundle (from his
back), and hung the bundle on a tree, saying, 'Let whoso finds it, take
it, as a gift,' and returned to the place where the young Sâkyans were.

And the Sâkya youths saw him coming from afar, and on seeing, they said
to him: 'What have you come back for, good Upâli?'

Then he told them \[what he had thought, and what he had done with the
bundle, and why he was returned\].

'Thou host done well, good Upâli (was the reply), in that thou didst not
return; for the Sâkyas are fierce, and might have killed thee.'

And they took Upâli the barber with them to the place where the Blessed
One was. And on arriving there, they bowed down before the Blessed One,
and

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

took their seats on one side. And so seated they said to the Blessed
One: 'We Sâkyas, Lord, are haughty. And this Upâli the barber has long
been an attendant, Lord, upon us. May the Blessed One admit him to the
Order before us, so that we may render him respect and reverence, and
bow down with outstretched hands before him (as our senior), and thus
shall the Sâkya pride be humbled in us Sâkyans <span
id="fr_658"></span>[1](#fn_644.md).'

Then the Blessed One received first Upâli the barber, and afterwards
those young men of the Sâkya clan, into the ranks of the Order. And the
venerable Bhaddiya, before that rainy season was over, became master of
the Threefold Wisdom <span id="fr_659"></span>[2](#fn_645.md), and the
venerable Anuruddha acquired the Heavenly Vision <span
id="fr_660"></span>[3](#fn_646.md), and the venerable Ânanda realised the
effect of having entered upon the Stream <span
id="fr_661"></span>[4](#fn_647.md), and Devadatta attained to that kind of
Iddhi which is attainable even by those who have not entered upon the
Excellent Way <span id="fr_662"></span>[5](#fn_648.md).

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

5 <span id="fr_663"></span>[1](#fn_649.md). Now at that time the venerable
Bhaddiya, who had retired into the forest to the foot of a tree, into
solitude, gave utterance over and over again to this ecstatic
exclamation: 'O happiness! O happiness!' And a number of Bhikkhus went
up to the place where the Blessed One was, and bowed down before him,
and took their seats on one side. And, so seated, they \[told the
Blessed One of this\], and added, 'For a certainty, Lord, the venerable
Bhaddiya is not contented as he lives the life of purity; but rather it
is when calling to mind the happiness of his former sovranty that he
gives vent to this saying.'

Then the Blessed One addressed a certain Bhikkhu; and said: 'Do you go,
O Bhikkhu, and in my name call Bhaddiya the Bhikkhu, saying, The
Teacher, venerable Bhaddiya, is calling for you."'

'Even so, Lord,' said that Bhikkhu, in assent to the Blessed One. And he
went to Bhaddiya, and called him \[in those words\].

6\. 'Very, well,' said the venerable Bhaddiya, in

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

assent to that Bhikkhu; and he came to the Blessed One, and bowed down
before him, and took his seat on one side. And when he was so seated,
the Blessed One said to the venerable Bhaddiya:

'Is it true, as they say, that you Bhaddiya, when retired into the
forest to the foot of a tree, into solitude, have given utterance over
and over again to this ecstatic exclamation, "O happiness! O happiness!"
What circumstance was it, O Bhaddiya, that you had in your mind when you
acted thus?'

'Formerly, Lord, when I was a king, I had a guard completely provided
both within and without my private apartments, both within and without
the town, and within the (borders of my) country. Yet though, Lord, I
was thus guarded and protected, I was fearful, anxious, distrustful, and
alarmed. But now, Lord, even when in the forest, at the foot of a tree,
in solitude, I am without fear or anxiety, trustful and not alarmed; I
dwell at ease, subdued <span id="fr_664"></span>[1](#fn_650.md),
secure <span id="fr_665"></span>[2](#fn_651.md), with mind as peaceful as
an antelope's <span id="fr_666"></span>[3](#fn_652.md). It was when calling
this fact to mind, Lord, that I gave utterance over and over again to
that cry, "O happiness! O happiness!"'

Then the Blessed One, on hearing that, gave utterance at that time to
this song:

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

'The man who harbours no harsh thoughts within him,  
Who cares not whether things are thus or thus,  
His state of joy, freedom from grief or care,  
The very gods obtain not to behold!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_633"></span>[224:1](sbe20074.htm#fr_647.md) With the whole of
the following story compare the, in many respects, fuller account given
by the commentator on the Dhammapada (Fausböll, pp. 139 and following).

<span id="fn_634"></span>[224:2](sbe20074.htm#fr_648.md) This was the spot
where Gotama spent the first week after his renunciation of the world,
before he went on to Râ*g*agaha (Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' I,
87). Professor Fausböll there (*G*âtaka I, 65) reads Anûpiya*m*, but all
his MSS. have the ŭ short. It is noteworthy that in our text the
locative is formed as if the word were feminine, though the neuter form
is used for the nominative.

<span id="fn_635"></span>[224:3](sbe20074.htm#fr_649.md) The more usual
mode of adding this description in similar passages at the commencement
of all the Suttas would lead us to expect here Mallâna*m* nigame.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[224:4](sbe20074.htm#fr_650.md) Compare Mahâvagga
I, 7, I, where the same thing is said of Yasa.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[225:1](sbe20074.htm#fr_651.md) Nippurisehi
turiyehi. That Childers's rendering, 'without men, without people,' is
inadequate is clear from the context at the passage which he quotes from
*G*âtaka I, 53.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[225:2](sbe20074.htm#fr_652.md) Ni*dd*âpeti.
Buddhaghosa says, 'Pull up the weeds' (ti*n*âni). The word occurs also
at *G*âtaka I, 215, where there is a similar list of farming operations,
which, though smaller, contains one or two items not given here.

<span id="fn_639"></span>[226:1](sbe20074.htm#fr_653.md) Maddâpeti. There
is mention of threshing (prati-han) already in the Vedas. See the
passages collected by Zimmer, 'Altindisches Leben,' p. 238. But treading
out is even still a very common, if not the more usual, process
throughout India and Ceylon.

<span id="fn_640"></span>[226:2](sbe20074.htm#fr_654.md) Atiharâpeti. See
Milinda Pa*ñ*ha, p. 66. The simple verb occurs also in a similar
connection in the Bhikkhunî-vibhaṅga in the introductory story to
Pâ*k*ittiya VII.

<span id="fn_641"></span>[226:3](sbe20074.htm#fr_655.md) That is, had died.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[227:1](sbe20074.htm#fr_656.md) Aha*m* tayâ.
Buddhaghosa explains that the Râ*g*a is beginning to say that he will go
with his friend. But a desire for the glory of sovereignty comes over
his heart, and he leaves the sentence unfinished. (The Pâli is given in
the notes on the text, p. 323.)

<span id="fn_643"></span>[228:1](sbe20074.htm#fr_657.md) Tyâha*m*. See Dr.
Morris's remarks on this elision in his introduction to the *K*ariyâ
Pi*t*aka (Pâli Text Society, 1882), where he makes it equal to tad
aha*m*. This seems to us open to question, at least in this passage,
where it may possibly stand for te aha*m*.

<span id="fn_644"></span>[230:1](sbe20074.htm#fr_658.md) This reputation of
the Sâkya family for pride is referred to in *G*âtaka I, 88, 89.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[230:2](sbe20074.htm#fr_659.md) Tisso vi*gg*â, see
Rh. D.'s remarks at pp. 161, 162 of 'Buddhist Suttas from the Pâli'
(S.B.E., vol. xi). They are probably here the three vi*gg*as referred to
in the Sutta-vibhaṅga, Pârâ*g*ika I, 1, 6-8, as the second of those is
the Heavenly Vision, here mentioned in the next clause.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[230:3](sbe20074.htm#fr_660.md) Dibba*k*akkhu, a
full description of the details of which will be found in the stock
paragraph translated by Rh. D. in 'Buddhist Suttas from the Pâli'
(S.B.E., vol. xi, pp. 216-218).

<span id="fn_647"></span>[230:4](sbe20074.htm#fr_661.md) Sotâpattiphala;
that is, he became free from the delusion of self (sakkâyadi*tth*i),
from doubt (vi*k*iki*kkh*â), and from dependence upon ceremonies or
works (sîlabbata-pârâmâsa). See Rh. D.'s manual, 'Buddhism,' pp.
108-110.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[230:5](sbe20074.htm#fr_662.md) Pothu*gg*anikâ
iddhi. What this may be is unknown to us. A fourfold Iddhi is described
in detail in the stock passage <span id="page_231">p. 231</span>
translated by Rh. D. in 'Buddhist Suttas from the Pâli,' S.B.E., vol.
xi, p. 214, and the fourfold Iddhi of the ideal king in the similar
passage, loc. cit., pp. 259-261. The Iddhi here referred to may be the
former of these two, though that list does not include the power
ascribed to Devadatta in the next chapter. At *G*âtaka I, 140, the
expression of our text here is replaced by *gh*âna, though the account
there is otherwise the same.

It is worthy of notice that Devadatta, though a Bhikkhu, is not honoured
with the standing epithet, 'venerable,' always used of the other members
of the Order, even when they are represented to have been of bad
character.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[231:1](sbe20074.htm#fr_663.md) The following
incident, with a summary of the preceding sections, forms the
introductory story to the 10th *G*âtaka (Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Birth
Stories,' i. pp. 190-193). The legend may have first arisen as an
explanation of the name Bhaddiya, which means 'the fortunate one.'

<span id="fn_650"></span>[232:1](sbe20074.htm#fr_664.md) Pannalomo. See our
note 2 on *K*ullavagga I, 6, 1 (above, vol. ii, p. 339).

<span id="fn_651"></span>[232:2](sbe20074.htm#fr_665.md) Paradavutto. This
is the reading of the Sinhalese MS., and is the correct one. See
Oldenberg's note at p. 363 of the edition of the text. Our translation
is conjectural.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[232:3](sbe20074.htm#fr_666.md) Migabhûtena
*k*etasâ. The meaning of miga in this phrase is not certain; and the
figure may be drawn from the careless mind of any animal in its natural
state. We have not noticed the idiom elsewhere; but compare the converse
figure, bhantamiga-sappa*t*ibhâgo sâsane anabhirato, at *G*âtaka I, 303,
6.
