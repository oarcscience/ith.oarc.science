# TENTH KHANDHAKA.

#### ON THE DUTIES OF BHIKKHUNÎS.

### 1.

1\. Now at that time the Blessed Buddha was staying among the Sâkyas in
Kapilavatthu, in the Nigrodhârâma. And Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî went
to the place where the Blessed One was, and on arriving there, bowed
down before the Blessed One, and remained standing on one side. And so
standing she spake thus to the Blessed One:

'It would be well, Lord, if women should be allowed to renounce their
homes and enter the homeless state under the doctrine and discipline
proclaimed by the Tathâgata.'

'Enough, O Gotamî! Let it not please thee that women should be allowed
to do so.'

\[And a second and a third time did Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî make the
same request in the same words, and receive the same reply.\]

Then Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî sad and sorrowful for that the Blessed
One would not permit women to enter the homeless state, bowed down
before the Blessed One, and keeping him on her right hand as she passed
him, departed thence weeping and in tears.

2\. Now when the Blessed One had remained at Kapilavatthu as long as he
thought fit, he set out on his journey towards Vesâlî; and travelling

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

straight on he in due course arrived thereat. And there at Vesâlî the
Blessed One stayed, in the Mahâvana, in the Kû*t*âgâra Hall.

And Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî cut off her hair, and put on
orange-coloured robes, and set out, with a number of women of the Sâkya
clan, towards Vesâlî; and in due course she arrived at Vesâlî, at the
Mahâvana, at the Kû*t*âgâra Hall. And Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî, with
swollen feet and covered with dust, sad and sorrowful, weeping and in
tears, took her stand outside under the entrance porch.

And the venerable Ânanda saw her so standing there, and on seeing her
so, he said to Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî?: 'Why standest thou there, outside the
porch, with swollen feet and covered with dust, sad and sorrowful,
weeping and in tears?'

'Inasmuch, O Ânanda, as the Lord, the Blessed One, does not permit women
to renounce their homes and enter the homeless state under the doctrine
and discipline proclaimed by the Tathâgata.'

3\. Then did the venerable Ânanda go up to the place where the Blessed
One was, and bow down before the Blessed One, and take his seat on one
side. And, so sitting, the venerable Ânanda said to the Blessed One:

'Behold, Lord, Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî is standing outside under the
entrance porch, with swollen feet and covered with dust, sad and
sorrowful, weeping and in tears, inasmuch as the Blessed One does not
permit women to renounce their homes and enter the homeless state under
the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the Blessed One. It were well,
Lord, if women were to have permission granted to them to do as she
desires.'

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

Enough, Ânanda! Let it not please thee that women should be allowed to
do so.'

\[And a second and a third time did Ânanda make the same request, in the
same words, and receive the same reply.\]

Then the venerable Ânanda thought: 'The Blessed One does not give his
permission, let me now ask the Blessed One on another ground.' And the
venerable Ânanda said to the Blessed One:

'Are women, Lord, capable--when they have gone forth from the household
life and entered the homeless state, under the doctrine and discipline
proclaimed by the Blessed One--are they capable of realising the fruit
of conversion, or of the second Path, or of the third Path, or of
Arahatship?'

'They are capable, Ânanda.'

'If then, Lord, they are capable thereof, since Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the
Gotamî has proved herself of great service to the Blessed One, when as
aunt and nurse she nourished him and gave him milk, and on the death of
his mother suckled the Blessed One at her own breast, it were well,
Lord, that women should have permission to go forth from the household
life and enter the homeless state, under the doctrine and discipline
proclaimed by the Tathâgata <span id="fr_863"></span>[1](#fn_849.md).'

4\. 'If then, Ânanda, Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî take upon herself the
Eight Chief Rules <span id="fr_864"></span>[2](#fn_850.md) let that be
reckoned to her as her initiation.'

 <span id="fr_865"></span>[3](#fn_851)\[They are these\]: (1.md) 'A
Bhikkhunî, even if of

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

a hundred years standing, shall make salutation to, shall rise up in the
presence of, shall bow down before, and shall perform all proper duties
towards a Bhikkhu, if only just initiated. This is a rule to be revered
and reverenced, honoured and observed, and her life long never to be
transgressed.

\(2\) 'A Bhikkhunî is not to spend the rainy season (of Was) in a
district <span id="fr_866"></span>[1](#fn_852.md) in which there is no
Bhikkhu. This is a rule . . . . never to be transgressed.

\(3\) 'Every half month a Bhikkhunî is to await from the
Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha two things, the asking as to (the date of) the Uposatha
ceremony <span id="fr_867"></span>[2](#fn_853.md), and the (time when the
Bhikkhu) will come to give the Exhortation <span
id="fr_868"></span>[3](#fn_854.md). This is a rule . . . . never to be
transgressed.

\(4\) 'After keeping the rainy season (of Was), the Bhikkhunî is to hold
Pavâra*n*â (to enquire whether any fault can be laid to her charge)
before both Sa*m*ghas--as well that of Bhikkhus as that of
Bhikkhunîs--with respect to three matters, namely, what has been seen,
and what has been heard, and what has been suspected <span
id="fr_869"></span>[4](#fn_855.md). This is a rule . . . . never to be
transgressed.

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

\(5\) 'A Bhikkhunî who has been guilty of a serious offence is to
undergo the Mânatta discipline towards both the Sa*m*ghas (Bhikkhus and
\]Bhikkhunîs). This is a rule . . . . never to be transgressed.

\(6\) 'When a Bhikkhunî, as novice, has been trained for two years in
the Six Rules <span id="fr_870"></span>[1](#fn_856.md), she is to ask leave
for the upasampadâ initiation from both Sa*m*ghas (as well that of
Bhikkhus as that of Bhikkhunîs <span id="fr_871"></span>[2](#fn_857).md).
This is a rule . . . . never to be transgressed.

\(7\) 'A Bhikkhunî is on no pretext to revile or abuse a Bhikkhu <span
id="fr_872"></span>[3](#fn_858.md). This is a rule . . . . never to be
transgressed.

\(8\) 'From henceforth official admonition <span
id="fr_873"></span>[4](#fn_859.md) by Bhikkhunîs of Bhikkhus is forbidden,
whereas the official admonition of Bhikkhunîs by Bhikkhus is not
forbidden. This is a rule . . . . never to be transgressed.

'If, Ânanda, Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî take upon herself these Eight
Chief Rules, let that be reckoned to her as her initiation.'

5\. Then the venerable Ânanda, when he had learnt from the Blessed One
these Eight Chief Rules, went to Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî and \[told
her all that the Blessed One had said\].

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

'Just, Ânanda, as a man or a woman, when young and of tender years,
accustomed to adorn himself, would, when he had bathed his head, receive
with both hands a garland of lotus flowers, or of jasmine flowers, or of
atimuttaka flowers, and place it on the top of his head; even so do I,
Ânanda, take upon me these Eight Chief Rules, never to be transgressed
my life long.'

6\. Then the venerable Ânanda returned to the Blessed One, and bowed
down before him, and took his seat on one side. And, so sitting, the
venerable Ânanda said to the Blessed One: 'Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî,
Lord, has taken upon herself the Eight Chief Rules, the aunt of the
Blessed One, has received the upasampadâ initiation.'

If, Ânanda, women had not received permission to go out from the
household life and enter the homeless state, under the doctrine and
discipline proclaimed by the Tathâgata, then would the pure religion,
Ânanda, have lasted long, the good law would have stood fast for a
thousand years. But since, Ânanda, women have now received that
permission, the pure religion, Ânanda, will not now last so long, the
good law will now stand fast for only five hundred years. Just, Ânanda,
as houses in which there are many women <span
id="fr_874"></span>[1](#fn_860.md) and but few men are easily
violated <span id="fr_875"></span>[2](#fn_861.md) by robber burglars <span
id="fr_876"></span>[3](#fn_862.md); just so, Ânanda, under

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

whatever doctrine and discipline women are allowed to go out from the
household life into the homeless state, that religion will not last
long. And just, Ânanda, as when the disease called mildew falls upon a
field of rice in fine condition, that field of rice does not continue
long; just so, Ânanda, under whatsoever doctrine and discipline women
are allowed to go forth from the household *li*fe into the homeless
state, that religion will not last long. And just, Ânanda, as when the
disease called blight falls upon a field of sugar-cane in good
condition, that field of sugar-cane does not continue long; just so,
Ânanda, under whatsoever doctrine and discipline women are allowed to go
forth from the household life into the homeless state, that religion
does not last long. And just, Ânanda, as a man would in anticipation
build an embankment to a great reservoir, beyond which the water should
not overpass; just even so, Ânanda, have I in anticipation laid down
these Eight Chief Rules for the Bhikkhunîs, their life long not to be
overpassed.'

Here end the Eight Chief Rules for the Bhikkhunîs.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_849"></span>[322:1](sbe20092.htm#fr_863.md) Ânandâ s conduct
in this matter was afterwards charged against him as a dukka*t*a. See
below, XI, 1, lo.

<span id="fn_850"></span>[322:2](sbe20092.htm#fr_864.md) The A*tth*a

<span id="fn_851"></span>[322:3](sbe20092.htm#fr_865.md) The whole of the
following eight paragraphs recur in the <span id="page_323">p.
323</span> Sutta Vibhaṅga, Pâ*k*ittiya XXI, 3, 1. It is very instructive
to notice the curious blunders which the Tibetan writers (translated by
Rockhill in his 'Life of the Buddha,' pp. 62, 63) make in the rendering
of the difficult technical terms in these Eight Rules.

<span id="fn_852"></span>[323:1](sbe20092.htm#fr_866.md) Âvâsa. Compare
*K*ullavagga I, 18, 1, VI, 15, I, VIII, x, 2. This rule is the 56th
Bhikkhunî Pâ*k*ittiya.

<span id="fn_853"></span>[323:2](sbe20092.htm#fr_867.md) The Bhikkhunîs are
to ask two or three days beforehand whether the Uposatha is to be held
on the 14th or 15th day of the month; says Buddhaghosa here. Compare
also the 59th Bhikkhunî Pâ*k*ittiya, where the whole passage recurs.

<span id="fn_854"></span>[323:3](sbe20092.htm#fr_868.md) Compare the 21st
Pâ*k*ittiya, and our note there.

<span id="fn_855"></span>[323:4](sbe20092.htm#fr_869.md) See Mahâvagga IV,
1, 13, 14. This rule is the same as the 57th Bhikkhunî Pâ*k*ittiya. The
mode of carrying out this rule is explained in detail below, X, 19.

<span id="fn_856"></span>[324:1](sbe20092.htm#fr_870.md) *Kh*asu dhammesu.
The Six Rules for novices. They are referred to in the Bhikkhunî
Vibhaṅga, under Pâ*k*ittiyas LXIII-LXVII.

<span id="fn_857"></span>[324:2](sbe20092.htm#fr_871.md) The actual
ordination (upasampadâ) itself is not complete till it has been
conferred by Bhikkhus (see the rule at X, 2, 2). The whole proceeding is
fully set out below, X, 27. Compare also the 63rd and 64th Bhikkhunî
Pâ*k*ittiyas.

<span id="fn_858"></span>[324:3](sbe20092.htm#fr_872.md) This is the 52nd
Bhikkhunî Pâ*k*ittiya.

<span id="fn_859"></span>[324:4](sbe20092.htm#fr_873.md) Va*k*ana-patho.
That is, literally, speech. But the reference is, no doubt, to the
various kinds of official admonitions given in detail in chapter 20
below.

<span id="fn_860"></span>[325:1](sbe20092.htm#fr_874.md) Bahutthikâni. The
context shows that we are to understand itthi and not attha. Compare
Rockhill's 'Life of the Buddha,' p.61.

<span id="fn_861"></span>[325:2](sbe20092.htm#fr_875.md) Suppadha*m*siyâni.
Compare Bhikkhunî Vibhaṅga, Sa*m*ghâdisesa III, 1, 2, and see also
*K*ullavagga VII, 5, 4.

<span id="fn_862"></span>[325:3](sbe20092.htm#fr_876.md) *K*orehi
kumbatthenakehi; on which Buddhaghosa has the following
note:--Kumbathenakehiti kumbhe dîpa*m* *g*âletvâ ena âlokena paraghare
bha*nd*a*m* vi*k*initvâ thenaka*k*orehi.
