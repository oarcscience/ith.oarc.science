<p>1. Now Mah&acirc;-pa<I>g</I>&acirc;pat&icirc; the Gotam&icirc; went up to the place where the Blessed One was, and bowed down before him, and stood respectfully on one side. And, so standing, Mah&acirc;-pa<I>g</I>&acirc;pat&icirc; the Gotam&icirc; spake thus to the Blessed One: 'What course, Lord,</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One taught Mah&acirc;-pa<I>g</I>&acirc;pat&icirc; the Gotam&icirc; and incited her, and aroused her, and gladdened her with religious discourse; and she, so taught, incited, aroused, and gladdened, bowed down before the Blessed One, and keeping him on net right hand as she passed him, she departed thence.</p>
