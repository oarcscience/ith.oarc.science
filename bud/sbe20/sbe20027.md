### 12.

1\. Now the Blessed One, when he had stayed at Râ*g*agaha as long as he
thought fit, set out on his journey toward Vesâlî <span
id="fr_236"></span>[3](#fn_230.md).

Now at that time the Bhikkhus went along, carrying their needles and
scissors and drugs in their bowls.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a bag to carry the drugs in <span
id="fr_237"></span>[4](#fn_231.md).'

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

They had no shoulder-strap.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a shoulder-strap <span
id="fr_238"></span>[1](#fn_232.md), or of a string to tie the bags on
with.'

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu tied his sandals on to his girdle,
and then entered the village for alms <span
id="fr_239"></span>[2](#fn_233.md). A certain Upâsaka, when saluting that
Bhikkhu, knocked up against the sandals with his head. The Bhikkhu was
annoyed; and when he had returned to the Ârâma, he told this matter to
the Bhikkhus. They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a bag to carry your sandals in,'

They had no shoulder-strap.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a shoulder-strap, or of a string to
tie the bags on with.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_230"></span>[98:3](sbe20027.htm#fr_236.md) This is merely
introduced to show that the following rules or privileges in this and
the next chapter (§§ 1, 2) were to be in force when the Bhikkhus were on
a journey.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[98:4](sbe20027.htm#fr_237.md) Neither here nor in
V, 11, 5 are we to understand that the needles and scissors are to be
carried in bags. They are mentioned in both passages merely to show the
inconvenience of having no separate receptacles for the thimbles and the
drugs.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[99:1](sbe20027.htm#fr_238.md) See the note on V,
9, 4.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[99:2](sbe20027.htm#fr_239.md) He would require
the sandals only when he came, in his journey, to rough places; not on
the smooth, well-trodden, village paths.
