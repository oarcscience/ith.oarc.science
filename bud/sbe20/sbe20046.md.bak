### 31.

1\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus did not use tooth-sticks <span
id="fr_407"></span>[5](#fn_399.md), and their mouths got a bad odour.

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'There are these five disadvantages, O Bhikkhus, in not using
tooth-sticks--it is bad for the eyes <span
id="fr_408"></span>[1](#fn_400.md)--the mouth becomes bad-smelling--the
passages by which the flavours of the food pass are not pure--bile and
phlegm get into <span id="fr_409"></span>[2](#fn_401.md) the food--and the
food does not taste well <span id="fr_410"></span>[3](#fn_402.md) to him
(who does not use them). These are the five disadvantages, O Bhikkhus,
in not using tooth-sticks.'

There are five advantages, O Bhikkhus, (&c., the converse of the last)

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, tooth-sticks.'

2\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus used long tooth-sticks;
and even struck the Sâma*n*eras with them.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to use long tooth-sticks.

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Whosoever does so,
shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, tooth-sticks up
to eight finger-breadths in length. And Sâma*n*eras are not to be struck
with them. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu, when using too short a tooth-stick,
got it stuck in his throat.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to use too short a tooth-stick. Whosoever does
so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus,
tooth-sticks four finger-breadths long at the least.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_399"></span>[146:5](sbe20046.htm#fr_407.md) Danta-ka*tth*am,
not 'tooth-brushes,' as Childers translates. <span id="page_147">p.
147</span> Mechanical skill had not advanced so far in those days; and
we hear nothing of brushes of any kind (see above, V, 2, 3, as to
hair-dressing). The 'tooth-sticks' were bits of sweet-smelling wood or
root, or creeper (see *G*âtaka I, 80; Mahâva*m*sa, p. 23), the ends of
which were to be masticated as a dentifrice, not rubbed on the teeth.
After using them the mouth was rinsed out with water; and so in all
other passages in the Khandhakas where they are mentioned (always in
reference to the duty of providing them), it is in connection with the
bringing of water for that purpose.

<span id="fn_400"></span>[147:1](sbe20046.htm#fr_408.md) This has of course
nothing to do with keeping the teeth white and beautiful; that was not
the purpose which the tooth-sticks were designed to effect. There seems
to have been really some idea that the use of them was good for the
eye-sight. So Buddhaghosa says here, a*k*akkhussan ti *k*akkhûna*m*
hita*m* ma hoti, parihâ*n*i*m* *g*aneti, quite in accordance with the
Sanskrit *k*akshushya. The words recur below, VI, 2, 2, in the same
sense.

<span id="fn_401"></span>[147:2](sbe20046.htm#fr_409.md) Pariyonandhanti.
Literally, 'envelope,' 'cover.'

<span id="fn_402"></span>[147:3](sbe20046.htm#fr_410.md) Na *kkh*âdeti.
This is a different word from *kh*âdeti, 'to cover.' It is *kh*ad No. 2
in Böhtlingk-Roth.
