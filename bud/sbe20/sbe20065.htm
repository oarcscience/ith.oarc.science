<p>1. Now at that time the Blessed One spake in many a figure concerning the Vinaya, speaking in praise of the Vinaya, in praise of learning the Vinaya, and again and again in reference thereto in praise of the venerable Up&acirc;li. Then said the Bhikkhus: 'The Blessed One speaks (&amp;c., down to) Up&acirc;li. Come, let us learn the Vinaya under the venerable Up&acirc;li.' And many Bhikkhus, senior and junior, and of medium standing, went to learn the Vinaya under the venerable Up&acirc;li. The venerable Up&acirc;li taught them standing, out of reverence for the senior Bhikkhus, and the senior Bhikkhus heard him standing, out of reverence for the law; and thereby both the senior Bhikkhus grew weary, and the venerable Up&acirc;li.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a junior Bhikkhu, when giving instruction, to sit on a seat of equal height, or higher, out of reverence for the law; and a senior Bhikkhu, when receiving instruction, to sit on a seat</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_207"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 207</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of equal height, or lower, out of reverence for the law&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_594"></A><A HREF="#fn_584"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>2. Now at that time a. number of Bhikkhus stood around Up&acirc;li, waiting for seats&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_595"></A><A HREF="#fn_585"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; and they grew weary.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to sit down together with brethren entitled to sit on seats of equal height.'</p>  
<p>Then the Bhikkhus thought, 'How many of us are entitled to sit on seats of equal height?'</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to sit on the same seat with those who are within three years of one another in seniority.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time a number of Bhikkhus, entitled to sit on the same seat, sat down on a couch, and broke the couch down; or sat down on a chair, and broke the chair down.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a couch, or a chair, for three persons.'</p>  
<p>Even when three sat on the couch, or chair, it broke.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, two to sit on a couch or a chair.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time Bhikkhus who were not entitled to seats of equal height, were afraid they would offend if they sat together on a long seat. They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>

<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to sit together on a long seat with others not entitled to sit on seats of equal height, unless they are women, or eunuchs, or hermaphrodites.'</p>  
<p>Then the Bhikkhus thought, 'What is the limit of length which is included under the term "long seat?"'</p>  
<p>'I allow the term "long seat" to be used, O Bhikkhus, of any seat long enough to accommodate three persons.</p>
