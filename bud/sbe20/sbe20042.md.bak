### 27.

1\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu went on his round for alms with
long finger-nails. A certain woman, seeing him, said to that Bhikkhu:
'Come along, Sir, and have connection with me.'

'Nay, Sister, that is not becoming.'

'If you do not, Sir, I will at once scratch <span
id="fr_352"></span>[1](#fn_345.md) my limbs with my own nails, and will
make as if I were angry, saying, "This Bhikkhu has ill-treated me."'

'Settle that with yourself, Sister.'

That woman did as she had said, and people running up seized that
Bhikkhu. Then they saw skin and blood on the woman's nails; and on
seeing that, they let the Bhikkhu go, saying, 'This is the

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

work of the woman herself. The Bhikkhu has not done it.'

Then that Bhikkhu, returning to the Ârâma, told the matter to the
Bhikkhus.

'What then, Sir, do you wear long nails?'

'It is even so, Sirs.'

The Bhikkhus who were moderate murmured (&c. . . . .) told the matter to
the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to wear long nails. Whosoever does so, shall
be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

2\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus tore off their nails with the nails,
bit them off with their teeth, or rubbed them down against the wall; and
their fingers were hurt.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, nail-cutters.'

They cut their nails down to the blood, and their fingers were hurt.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to cut your nails according to the length of
the flesh.'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus had all the twenty nails (on
their hands and feet) polished.

People murmured, &c., saying, 'Like those who still live in the
pleasures of the world.'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to have the twenty nails polished. I allow
you, O Bhikkhus, to remove the dirt only.'

3\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus' hair grew long.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'Are the Bhikkhus able, O Bhikkhus, to remove one another's hair?'

'They are, Lord.'

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, after he
had delivered a religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of razors, of a hone to sharpen the
razors on, of powder prepared with Sipâ*t*ika-gum to prevent them
rusting <span id="fr_353"></span>[1](#fn_346.md), of a sheath to hold them
in <span id="fr_354"></span>[2](#fn_347.md), and of all the apparatus of a
barber <span id="fr_355"></span>[3](#fn_348.md).'

4\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus wore (&c., as usual,
down to)

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to have your beards cut (by barbers) <span
id="fr_356"></span>[4](#fn_349.md), nor to let them grow long, nor to wear
them long on the chin like a goat's beard <span
id="fr_357"></span>[5](#fn_350.md), nor so cut that they have four
corners <span id="fr_358"></span>[6](#fn_351.md), nor to cut off the hair
growing on your breast <span id="fr_359"></span>[7](#fn_352.md), nor to cut
the hair on your bellies into figures <span
id="fr_360"></span>[8](#fn_353.md), nor to wear whiskers <span
id="fr_361"></span>[9](#fn_354.md), nor to remove the hair from your
private parts <span id="fr_362"></span>[10](#fn_355.md). Whosoever does so,
shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had a fistula <span
id="fr_363"></span>[1](#fn_356.md), and the ointment would not stick to it.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, on account of disease, to remove the hair from
the private parts.'

5\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus (&c., as before, down
to)

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to have your hair cut off with a knife <span
id="fr_364"></span>[2](#fn_357.md). Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a
dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had a sore on his head, and the hair
could not be removed with a razor.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, on account of disease, to have your hair cut
off with a knife.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus wore the hair in their nostrils long.

People murmured, &c., saying, 'Like the devil-worshippers  <span
id="fr_365"></span>[3](#fn_358.md).'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to wear the hair in your nostrils long.
Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus had the hair in their nostrils pulled out
with a potsherd <span id="fr_366"></span>[4](#fn_359.md), or with. beeswax;
and their nostrils were hurt.

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of pincers <span
id="fr_367"></span>[1](sbe20043.htm#fn_360.md).'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus (&c.; as before, ending
with)

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to have the white hairs pulled out (off your
heads). Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

6\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu's ears were stopped with the wax.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of an instrument to remove the wax
from the ear <span id="fr_368"></span>[2](sbe20043.htm#fn_361.md).'

\[Then a paragraph as to the substances of which it may be made, word
for word, as in Mahâvagga VI, 6, 21; 12, 3; *K*ullavagga V, 5, 2; 29, 2,
&c.\]
