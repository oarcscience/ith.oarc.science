### 7.

1\. Now at that time a number of Bhikkhus carried on robe-making in the
open air. The *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus beat their bedding to get

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

the dust out in the open space <span id="fr_830"></span>[1](#fn_816.md) to
windward of them, and covered the Bhikkhus (who were at work) with dust.

The moderate Bhikkhus murmured, &c. . . . . told the Blessed One, &c. .
. . . and he said to the Bhikkhus:

'Therefore, O Bhikkhus, do I establish a rule of conduct for the
Bhikkhus in respect of lodging-places, according to which they are to
behave themselves in respect thereof.

2\. 'In whatever Vihâra he is staying, if that Vihâra is dirty, he
should, if he can, make it clean. When cleaning the Vihâra, he should
first take out his bowl and his robe and the mat used for sitting upon,
and the bolster and . pillows, and put them down on one side. Taking the
bed-frame down (from its stand), he should carry it out \[and so on as
in VIII, 1, 2, down to the end\] <span id="fr_831"></span>[2](#fn_817.md).

'He should not beat the bedding to get the dust out close to the
Bhikkhus, or to the Vihâra, or to the drinking-water, or to the water
for washing, or in the open space (in front of the Vihâra) to wind-ward
of it or the Bhikkhus, but to leeward.

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

3\. 'The floor coverings should be dried in the sun \[and so on as in
VIII I, 4, and 5, to the end, reading "in the place where it stood (or
lay)" for "in the place to which it belongs"\].

4\. 'If he is dwelling in the same Vihâra with an older (Bhikkhu), no
recitation should be given, nor examination held, nor exhortation made,
nor Dhamma spoken <span id="fr_832"></span>[1](#fn_818) (to a pupil.md),
without leave being asked of the senior. Nor should a lamp be lighted or
extinguished, nor the lattices opened or closed, without his leave.

'If he is walking up and down on the same *K*aṅkama with an older
(Bhikkhu), then he should turn back at the spot where his senior turns
back; and he should not touch his senior even with the corner of his
robe.

'This, O Bhikkhus, is the rule of conduct, that I lay down for the
Bhikkhus in respect of lodging-places, according to which they are to
behave themselves therein.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_816"></span>[295:1](sbe20085.htm#fr_830.md) Aṅgana. This is
not 'courtyard,' as Childers renders it, but a part of the Ârâma,
immediately in front of the hut or Vihâra, which is kept as an, open
space, and daily swept. The Sinhalese name for it is midula; there those
who sleep in the hut spend the greater part of the day, and not even
grass is allowed to grow upon it. The term is a very common one, and its
meaning is not doubtful. Compare the *G*âtaka book, I, 124, 151, 421;
II, 249, 250, 345. Ekaṅgana*m* bhavati, at ibid. I, 53, 12, is to become
one open space, as ekaṅgana*m* karoti at II, 357, is to clear a forest,
and turn it into an open space.

<span id="fn_817"></span>[295:2](sbe20085.htm#fr_831.md) The order is
slightly different, but all the details are the same. The only addition
is that in speaking of taking out the floor covetings, he is directed to
notice where they lay.

<span id="fn_818"></span>[296:1](sbe20085.htm#fr_832.md) All the preceding
expressions have occurred at Mahâvagga I, 26, 1; see also 32, 1, and 38,
6.
