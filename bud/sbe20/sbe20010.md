Now at that time the Bhikkhus in chapter (Sa*m*gha) assembled, since
they became violent, quarrelsome, and disputatious, and kept on wounding
one another with sharp words <span id="fr_42"></span>[4](#fn_41), were
unable

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

to settle the disputed question (that was brought before them).

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

 <span id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_42)'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to settle
such a dispute by the vote of the majority. A Bhikkhu who shall be
possessed of five qualifications shall be appointed as taker of the
voting tickets--one who does not walk in partiality, one who does not
walk in malice, one who does not walk in folly, one who does not walk in
fear <span id="fr_44"></span>[2](#fn_43), one who knows what (votes)
have been taken and what have not been taken.

'And thus shall he be appointed.

'First the Bhikkhu is to be requested (whether he will undertake the
office). Then some able and discreet Bhikkhu is to bring the matter
before the Sa*m*gha, saying,

'"Let the venerable Sa*m*gha hear me. If the time seems meet to the
Sa*m*gha, let the Sa*m*gha appoint a Bhikkhu of such and such a name as
taker of the voting tickets.

'"This is the motion (*ñ*atti).

'"Let the venerable Sa*m*gha hear me. The Sa*m*gha appoints a Bhikkhu of
such and such a name as taker of the tickets. Whosoever of the venerable
ones approves of the Bhikkhu of such and such a name being appointed as
taker of the

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

tickets, let him keep silence. Whosoever approves not thereof, let him
speak. The Bhikkhu of such and such a name is appointed by the Sa*m*gha
as taker of the voting tickets. Therefore is it silent. Thus do I
understand.'"

mukhaisattîhi vitudantâ viharanti. Literally, 'with mouth-javelins.'
Vitudati, and not vitûdati as Childers gives, is the right spelling. So
Fausböll reads at *G*âtaka II, 185, 186.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[25:1](sbe20010.htm#fr_43) From here to the end
of the chapter recurs in IV, 14, 24.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[25:2](sbe20010.htm#fr_44) These are the
qualifications always ascribed to one who rightly fills any judicial
offence, and are called the four Agatis. They are the especial
attributes of a good king sitting as judge, and are mentioned elsewhere
(Sa*m*ghâdisesa XIII; Mahâvagga VIII, 5, 2; VIII, 6, 1; and below, VI,
11, 2) of other officials of the order with duties similar to those in
the text.
