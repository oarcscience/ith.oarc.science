arranged for the privilege of supplying food to the Sa*m*gha, and in the
dining-hall many fragments of rice were allowed to fall.

so carelessly. Each single ball of rice is the result of hundredfold
labour!'

The Bhikkhus heard of the people thus murmuring, &c., and they told the
matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, whatever thing falls when it is being given to
you, yourselves to pick it up and eat it. That has been presented, O
Bhikkhus, by the givers.'
