### 15.

1\. Now at that time the people gave food to the Bhikkhus, and the
Bhikkhus gave to the Bhikkhunîs. The people murmured, were indignant,
and complained, saying: 'How can their reverences give away to others
what was given for them to have--as if we did not know how to give
gifts?'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'A Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, is not to give away to others what was given for
them themselves to have. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a
dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus had come into the possession of some (meat
for) food. They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to give it to the Sa*m*gha.'

Too much came into their possession.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to give away that which was given to special
individuals (and to keep that which had come into the possession of the
Sa*m*gha as a whole <span id="fr_913"></span>[1](#fn_899)).'

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

Now at that time food, which had been stored up for the Bhikkhus, had
come into their possession.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow food that has been stored up to be enjoyed by the Bhikkhunîs
after they have had it given over to them by the Bhikkhus.'

2\. \[The same repeated, reading Bhikkhunî for Bhikkhu, and vice
versâ.\]
