### 9.

1\. Now the Blessed One, proceeding on his journey, arrived in due
course at Sâvatthi; and there.

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

at Sâvatthi, the Blessed One stayed in the *G*etavana, the park of
Anâtha Pi*nd*ika. Then Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder \[invited the
Blessed One for the morrow's meal, and when the meal was over, he said
to the Blessed One <span id="fr_574"></span>[1](#fn_564.md)\]:

'What, Lord, shall I do with regard to the *G*etavana?'

You may dedicate it, O householder, to the use of the Sa*m*gha of the
four directions <span id="fr_575"></span>[2](#fn_565.md) either now here
present, or hereafter to arrive.'

'Even so, Lord,' said Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder in assent to the
Blessed One, and he did so.

2\. Then the Blessed One gave thanks to Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder
in these verses. \[Here follow the same verses as were used above in VI,
1, 5 on the presentation of the *G*etavana <span
id="fr_576"></span>[3](#fn_566.md).\]

<span id="fn_564"></span>[198:1](sbe20061.htm#fr_574.md) The usual terms
are here followed throughout: see, for instance, above, VI, 4, 6, 7.

<span id="fn_565"></span>[198:2](sbe20061.htm#fr_575.md) That is 'of all
the world.' See our note above on Mahâvagga VIII, 27, 5, where the
phrase has already occurred.

<span id="fn_566"></span>[198:3](sbe20061.htm#fr_576.md) The verses are
quoted in the account of Anâtha Pi*nd*ika's gift given in the *G*âtaka
commentary (Fausböll I, 93; Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' I, 131).
