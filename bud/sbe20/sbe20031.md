### 16.

1\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus in the bath-room put the robes down on
the ground, and the robes became dirty.

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a bamboo to hang your robes on, and
of a string to hang your robes on <span
id="fr_285"></span>[1](#fn_279).'

When rain fell, it fell over the robes.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to have a hall to the bath-room.'

The basement of the bath-room hall was too low \[&c., as in 11. 6; 14. 2
as to basement, roof-facing, stairs, and balustrade, followed by the
closing words of 11. 6 and 14. 2, down to the end\].

2\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus were afraid <span
id="fr_286"></span>[2](#fn_280) to do service to one another, both when
in the bath-room and in the water.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, three kinds of coverings--the covering of the
bath-room, the covering of the water, and the covering by clothes <span
id="fr_287"></span>[3](#fn_281).'

Now at that time there was no water in the bath-room.

They told this matter to the Blessed One. I allow, O Bhikkhus, a well.'

The facing of the well fell in <span id="fr_288"></span>[4](#fn_282).

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to line the well with

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

facings of three kinds <span id="fr_289"></span>[1](#fn_283)--brick
facing, stone facing, and wooden facing.'

\[Then follow the paragraphs as to the high basement, the facing of the
roof, the stairs, and the balustrade, as in 11. 6; 14. 2; and above, §
1 <span id="fr_290"></span>[2](#fn_284).\]

Now at that time the Bhikkhus drew water with jungle-rope <span
id="fr_291"></span>[3](#fn_285), or with their waistbands.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a string rope to draw water with.'

Their hands were hurt (by the rope).

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a long pole balanced as a
lever <span id="fr_292"></span>[4](#fn_286), of a bullock machine <span
id="fr_293"></span>[5](#fn_287), or of a wheel and axle <span
id="fr_294"></span>[6](#fn_288).'

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

A number of pots were broken.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, water-vessels <span
id="fr_295"></span>[1](#fn_289) of three kinds--brass pots, wooden pots,
and skins <span id="fr_296"></span>[2](#fn_290).'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus, when drawing water in the open air,
suffered from heat and cold.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to build a shed over the well <span
id="fr_297"></span>[3](#fn_291).'

Straw and plaster fell into the building over the well.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to cover the shed with skins, and to plaster
it within and without; and I allow the use of whitewash, blacking,
red-colouring, wreath work, creeper work, cupboards, bamboos to hang
robes on, and strings to hang robes on.'

The well was uncovered, and it was littered over with grass, and
plaster, and dirt.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, a lid <span id="fr_298"></span>[4](#fn_292) to
the well.'

Water-vessels were found wanting.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of troughs <span
id="fr_299"></span>[5](#fn_293) and basons.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_279"></span>[111:1](sbe20031.htm#fr_285) So also above, 11.
6 (at the end), and 14. 2 (at the end).

<span id="fn_280"></span>[111:2](sbe20031.htm#fr_286) On account of the
rule laid down in chapter 15.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[111:3](sbe20031.htm#fr_287) This rule
abrogates that laid down in chapter 15, so far as regards bathing and
shampooing. Buddhaghosa says accordingly, Tisso pa*t*i*kkh*âdayo ti.
Ettha *g*antâghara-pa*t*i*kkh*âdi *k*a udakapa*t*i*kkh*âdi *k*a
parikamma*m* karontass’ eva va*tt*ati, sesesu abhivâdanâdisu na
va*tt*ati. Vattha-pa*t*i*kkh*âdi sabba-kammesu va*tt*ati.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[111:4](sbe20031.htm#fr_288) Kûla*m* lu*gg*ati.
(The reading is not without doubt.) Compare Palu*gg*ati. The same
expression occurs below, V, 17, 2; and lu*gg*ati at Mahâvagga VIII, 21,
1.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[112:1](sbe20031.htm#fr_289) *K*initu*m* tayo
*k*aye. See our note 4 above on V, 14, 3, and the passages there quoted.
The whole passage occurs V, 11, 6.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[112:2](sbe20031.htm#fr_290) All this refers
doubtless to the kind of shed or portico to be erected over the well.
(See below.) One would expect that the formal licence for such a
ma*nd*apa would have been inserted here in due course as above, 11. 6,
for the Ka*th*ina-sâlâ.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[112:3](sbe20031.htm#fr_291) This is the usual
Anglo-Indian term for the creepers so commonly used for such purposes.
The Pâli word is vallikâ, which occurs in a different sense at V, 2, I.

<span id="fn_286"></span>[112:4](sbe20031.htm#fr_292) Tulâ. This is the
ordinary and simple machine, so common in all countries where irrigation
is carried on, for raising water from canals or from shallow wells.
Buddhaghosa says here: Tulan ti pa*nn*ikâna*m* viya udaka
abbhâhana-tulâ. Pa*nn*ika is 'florist' (see *G*âtaka I, 411, II, 180).
Abbhâhana must be wrong (see Sutta Nipâta III, 8, 8); possibly
abbhâvâhana is the correct reading.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[112:5](sbe20031.htm#fr_293) The name of this
machine is spelt differently in the MSS. (karaka*t*aṅka the Sinhalese
MS., and karaka*d*aka the Burmese MSS.), and the reading is doubtful.
Buddhaghosa says: Dakadaka*t*ako (sic! In the next note but two the same
MS. reads ka*t*adaka*t*ake) vu*kk*ati go*n*e vâ yo*g*etvâ hatthehi vâ
gahetvâ dîgha-varattâdîhi âka*ddh*ana-yanta*m*. We can only say
negatively that the word can have nothing to do either with karka*t*aka,
a hook in the form of a crab's claw; or with kara-ka*nt*aka,
finger-nail.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[112:6](sbe20031.htm#fr_294)
*K*akkava*tt*aka*m*, on which Buddhaghosa has the unintelligible note
arahatta(!)-gha*t*i-yanta*m*.

<span id="fn_289"></span>[113:1](sbe20031.htm#fr_295) Vârake. The
spelling of this word in Childers's Dictionary (varâko) is a misprint.
Both the passages he quotes read vârako. Other water-vessels, besides
these three, are allowed by the closing rule of this chapter.

<span id="fn_290"></span>[113:2](sbe20031.htm#fr_296)
*K*amma-kha*nd*a*m* nâma tûlâya vâ ka*t*adaka*t*ake vâ yo*g*etabba*m*
*k*amma-bhâ*g*ana*m* (B.). The rendering adopted by Childers from
Turnour (Mahâva*m*sa, p. 3) is therefore incorrect.

<span id="fn_291"></span>[113:3](sbe20031.htm#fr_297) The following
passage has already occurred above, V, 11, 6 and V, 14, 3.

<span id="fn_292"></span>[113:4](sbe20031.htm#fr_298) Apidhâna*m*. See
Mahâvagga VI, 12, 2.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[113:5](sbe20031.htm#fr_299) Udaka-do*n*i*m*.
At *G*âtaka I, 450, such a do*n*i is said to have been made out of the
trunk of a tree. Compare the use of mattikâ-do*n*ika*m* at V, 14, 3.
