### 22.

1\. Now at that time a courtesan named A*ddh*akâsî <span
id="fr_941"></span>[3](#fn_925) had adopted the religious life under the
Bhikkhunîs, and she wanted to go to Sâvatthi to be received as full
member of the Order (to receive the upasampadâ initiation) by the
Blessed One himself. And men of abandoned life heard of it, and beset
the road. And when A*ddh*akâsî, the courtesan, heard that they had done
so, she sent a messenger to the Blessed One, saying: 'I want to receive
the upasampadâ initiation: what course of action should I adopt?'

Then the Blessed One, in that connection, addressed the Bhikkhus, after
delivering a religious discourse <span id="fr_942"></span>[4](#fn_926),
and said: 'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to confer the upasampadâ initiation
(upon Bhikkhunîs) even by a messenger <span
id="fr_943"></span>[5](#fn_927).'

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

2\. They conferred it by (sending) a Bhikkhu as the messenger.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to confer the upasampadâ initiation on a
Bhikkhunî by sending a Bhikkhu as messenger. Whosoever does so, shall be
guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

They conferred it by sending a female student . . . . . a male novice .
. . . . a female novice . . . . . an ignorant, incompetent Bhikkhunî, as
the messenger.

\[Similar decision in each case.\]

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to confer the upasampadâ initiation by sending
a learned, competent Bhikkhunî, as a messenger.'

3\. 'That Bhikkhunî messenger is to go before the Sa*m*gha, and
arranging her robe over one shoulder, is to bow down before the
Sa*m*gha, and sitting on her heels, to stretch forth her joined palms,
and say "N. N., having been desirous of receiving the upasampadâ
initiation with the lady, M. M. (as her proposer), has received it on
the one hand from the Bhikkhunî-sa*m*gha, and has there been declared
free (from the Disqualifications <span id="fr_944"></span>[1](#fn_928)).
But she is prevented by some danger or other from coming before the
Sa*m*gha (to have her initiation confirmed) <span
id="fr_945"></span>[2](#fn_929). N. N. asks the Sa*m*gha for initiation,
Let the Sa*m*gha raise her up (out of the worldly life) out of
compassion upon her.' \[To be said thrice.\]

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

'Then let a learned, competent Bhikkhu lay the motion before the
Sa*m*gha. "Let the Sa*m*gha, venerable Sirs, hear me. N. N., having been
desirous . . . . . \[statement of fact, as before\]. If it seem meet to
the Sa*m*gha, let the Sa*m*gha confer the upasampadâ initiation upon N.
N., M. M. being her proposer. That is the motion.

'"Let the Sa*m*gha, venerable Sirs, hear me. N. N., . . . . \[statement
of fact, as before\]. The Sa*m*gha hereby confers the upasampadâ
initiation upon N. N., M. M. being her proposer. Whosoever of the
venerable ones approves thereof, let him keep silence. Whosoever
approves not thereof, let him speak. And a second time I say the same
thing. N. N., . . . . . (&c., down to) let him speak. And a third time I
say the same thing. N. N., . . . . . (&c., down to) let him speak.

'"The Sa*m*gha has hereby conferred the upasampadâ initiation upon N.
N., M. M. being her proposer. The Sa*m*gha approves thereof. Therefore
is it silent. Thus do I understand."'

'Then, further, let them (the Bhikkhus) measure the shadow, tell (the
messenger that she may tell the newly-received Bhikkhunî) what season
and what date it is, tell her what part of the day it is, tell her the
whole formula; and tell the Bhikkhunîs to teach her what are the three
things allowed, and what are the eight things interdicted <span
id="fr_946"></span>[1](#fn_930).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_925"></span>[360:3](sbe20113.htm#fr_941) On the meaning of
this nickname or epithet, compare our note on Mahâvagga VIII, 2 (and see
also VIII, 1, 1, and 3).

<span id="fn_926"></span>[360:4](sbe20113.htm#fr_942) As set out in
*K*ullavagga I, 1; Mahâvagga I, 35, 6.

<span id="fn_927"></span>[360:5](sbe20113.htm#fr_943) The ordinary rule,
no doubt, required, as in the case of Bhikkhus, <span id="page_361">p.
361</span> a Sa*m*gha of not less than ten persons (Mahâvagga I, 31, 2,
and IX, 4, 1), each of ten years standing or more (Mahâvagga I, 31, 8).
But even for Bhikkhus there were, under special circumstances, certain
relaxations of this rule (Mahâvagga V, 13, II).

<span id="fn_928"></span>[361:1](sbe20113.htm#fr_944) See above, X, 17,
1, for the twenty-four Disqualifications.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[361:2](sbe20113.htm#fr_945) Compare above, X,
