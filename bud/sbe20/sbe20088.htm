<p>1. Now the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'Now henceforth I, O Bhikkhus, will not hold Uposatha, nor recite the P&acirc;timokkha; let you yourselves, O Bhikkhus, henceforth hold Uposatha and recite the P&acirc;timokkha. It is, O Bhikkhus, an impossible thing and an inexpedient that the Tath&acirc;gata should hold Uposatha and recite the P&acirc;timokkha before an assembly which is not pure. And the P&acirc;timokkha, O Bhikkhus, is not to be listened to by one who has committed an offence. Whosoever shall so listen to it, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, for whomsoever shall listen to the P&acirc;timokkha at a time when he is guilty, to interdict for him the P&acirc;timokkha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_847"></A><A HREF="#fn_833"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>'And thus, O Bhikkhus, is it to be interdicted. On the day of Uposatha, on the fourteenth or fifteenth day of the month, and at a time when that individual is present, thus shall it be proposed in the midst of the Sa<I>m</I>gha:</p>  
<p>'"Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha hear me. Such and such an individual is guilty of an offence. For him</p>

<p>do I interdict the P&acirc;timokkha to the effect that it shall not be recited when he is present. The P&acirc;timokkha is accordingly interdicted."'</p>

H.O. has already pointed out (in his 'Buddha,' p. 381, note 2) that we have evidently here a later innovation. The whole frame of the P&acirc;timokkha shows that it was at first intended that a guilty Bhikkhu should confess his offence during the recitation, if he had not done so before,</P>
