<p>There are five advantages, O Bhikkhus, (&amp;c., the converse of the last)</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, tooth-sticks.'</p>

<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to use long tooth-sticks.</p>

<p>Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu, when using too short a tooth-stick, got it stuck in his throat.</p>

<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to use too short a tooth-stick. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, tooth-sticks four finger-breadths long at the least.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_399"></A><A HREF="sbe20046.htm#fr_407">146:5</A> Danta-ka<I>t</I><I>th</I>am, not 'tooth-brushes,' as Childers translates. <A NAME="page_147"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 147</FONT></A> Mechanical skill had not advanced so far in those days; and we hear nothing of brushes of any kind (see above, V, 2, 3, as to hair-dressing). The 'tooth-sticks' were bits of sweet-smelling wood or root, or creeper (see <I>G</I>&acirc;taka I, 80; Mah&acirc;va<I>m</I>sa, p. 23), the ends of which were to be masticated as a dentifrice, not rubbed on the teeth. After using them the mouth was rinsed out with water; and so in all other passages in the Khandhakas where they are mentioned (always in reference to the duty of providing them), it is in connection with the bringing of water for that purpose. </P>
<P><A NAME="fn_400"></A><A HREF="sbe20046.htm#fr_408">147:1</A> This has of course nothing to do with keeping the teeth white and beautiful; that was not the purpose which the tooth-sticks were designed to effect. There seems to have been really some idea that the use of them was good for the eye-sight. So Buddhaghosa says here, a<I>k</I>akkhussan ti <I>k</I>akkh&ucirc;na<I>m</I> hita<I>m</I> ma hoti, parih&acirc;<I>n</I>i<I>m</I> <I>g</I>aneti, quite in accordance with the Sanskrit <I>k</I>akshushya. The words recur below, VI, 2, 2, in the same sense.</P>
