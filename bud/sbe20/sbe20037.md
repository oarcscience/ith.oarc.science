### 22.

1\. Now when the Blessed One had remained at Bhaggâ as long as he
thought fit, he set out on his journey towards Sâvatthi. And journeying
straight on he arrived in due course at Sâvatthi, and there, at
Sâvatthi, he stayed in the *G*etavana, in the Ârâma of Anâtha-pi*nd*ika.

Now Visâkhâ the mother of Migâra, bringing small jars <span
id="fr_337"></span>[2](#fn_331), and earthenware foot-scrubbers <span
id="fr_338"></span>[3](#fn_332), and brooms, went up to the place where
the Blessed One was; and when she had come there, she saluted the
Blessed One, and took her seat on one side. And so sitting, Visâkhâ the
mother of Migâra said to the Blessed One, 'May the Blessed One accept
these things at my hands, that that may be to me for long for a blessing
and a joy.' And the Blessed One accepted the small jars and the brooms;
but the Blessed One did not accept the earthenware foot-scrubbers.

Then the Blessed One instructed (&c., as usual, see 21. 2, down to) she
departed thence. And the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that
connection, after having delivered a religious discourse, addressed the
Bhikkhus, and said:

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, small jars and brooms. You are not, O
Bhikkhus, to make use of earthen-ware foot-scrubbers. Whosoever does so,
shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, three kinds of
things to rub the feet with--to wit, sandstone <span
id="fr_339"></span>[1](#fn_333), gravel <span
id="fr_340"></span>[1](#fn_333), and sea-foam <span
id="fr_341"></span>[2](#fn_334).'

2\. \[A similar paragraph ending\]

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of fans and flower-stands <span
id="fr_342"></span>[3](#fn_335).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_331"></span>[130:2](sbe20037.htm#fr_337) Gha*t*aka*m*. At
*G*âtaka I, 32 this word seems to mean the capital of a pillar. We have
taken it as the diminutive of gha*t*a, especially as Buddhaghosa says
nothing; but this is doubtful.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[130:3](sbe20037.htm#fr_338) Kataka*m*. To the
note quoted at p. 318 of the text, which shows that this is a kind of
foot-rubber, Buddhaghosa adds that this article is forbidden
bâhulikânuyogattâ. This injunction is repeated below at V, 37, where
kataka is mentioned as a kind of earthenware.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[131:1](sbe20037.htm#fr_340) Sakkharâ and
ka*th*ala, the exact distinction between which two terms is not stated.

<span id="fn_334"></span>[131:2](sbe20037.htm#fr_341) Samudda-phe*n*aka.
By this name are designated the bones of the cuttle-fish which, when
cast up by the waves on the sea-shore, are not unlike petrified foam,
and have actually been introduced from the East into use in Europe as a
kind of rough natural soap; and are now sold for that purpose in most
chemists' shops in England (compare Meerschaum). The same word is found
in later Sanskrit works.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[131:3](sbe20037.htm#fr_342) Tâlava*nt*a*m*.
See *G*âtaka I, 26, 5 (at the end); and compare tâlava*nt*aka*m* below,
V, 29, 4.
