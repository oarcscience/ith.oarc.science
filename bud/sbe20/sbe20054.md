### 2.

1\. And the people heard, saying, 'Vihâras have been allowed by the
Blessed One.' And they built Vihâras zealously. Those Vihâras had no
doors <span id="fr_447"></span>[3](#fn_438), and snakes, scorpions, and
centipedes got in.

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a door <span id="fr_448"></span>[1](#fn_439).'

They made holes in the wall, and tied the door on with string or with
creepers, These were eaten by mice and white ants; and when the things
by which the doors had been tied on had been eaten away, the doors fell.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, door-posts and lintel, hollow like a mortar, for
the door to revolve in, and projections to the door for it to revolve
on.'

The doors would not come to.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a hole to pass a string through with which to pull
the door to, and a string for that purpose.'

The doors could not be made fast <span id="fr_449"></span>[2](#fn_440).

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, rings on the door for the bolt to work along in,
blocks of wood fixed to the edge of the door-post and containing a
cavity for the bolt to go into, a pin to secure the bolt by, and a
bolt.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus were not able to open the door.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, key-holes, and keys of three kinds--bronze keys,
and keys of hard wood, and keys of horn.'

When anybody unlocked them <span id="fr_450"></span>[1](#fn_441), and
entered, the Vihâras became unprotected.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a yantaka, and a pin to it <span
id="fr_451"></span>[2](#fn_442).'

2\. Now at that time the Vihâras were thatched; and in the cold season
they were cold, and in the hot season hot.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to cover them (with skins) <span
id="fr_452"></span>[3](#fn_443), and to plaster them within and
without.'

Now at that time the Vihâras had no windows, and they were bad for the
eyes, and had a disagreeable odour.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, windows of three kinds--windows made with railings
 <span id="fr_453"></span>[4](#fn_444), windows made with network <span
id="fr_454"></span>[5](#fn_445), and windows made with slips of
wood <span id="fr_455"></span>[6](#fn_446).'

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

Squirrels and bats <span id="fr_456"></span>[1](#fn_447) entered through
the opening for the window.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, window-blinds (or curtains) <span
id="fr_457"></span>[2](#fn_448).'

The squirrels and bats still got in through the interstices between the
blind (and the wall).

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, shutters, and rolls or bags (to fill up
interstices with) <span id="fr_458"></span>[3](#fn_449).

3\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus slept on the floor, and both their
limbs and their robes became dirty.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, mats made of grass.'

The mats were eaten by mice and white ants.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a solid bench or divan (built up against the wall
of a room, or under the verandah against the outside wall of the
house) <span id="fr_459"></span>[4](#fn_450).

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

On the solid bench their limbs ached.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, bedsteads made of laths of split bamboo <span
id="fr_460"></span>[1](#fn_451).'

Now at that time a bier-like masâraka <span
id="fr_461"></span>[2](#fn_452) bedstead--a masâraka chair--a bier-like
bundikâbaddha <span id="fr_462"></span>[3](#fn_453) bedstead--a
bundikâbaddha chair--a bier-like kulîra-pâdaka <span
id="fr_463"></span>[4](#fn_454) bedstead--a kulîra-pâdaka chair--a
bier-like âha*kk*a-pâdaka <span id="fr_464"></span>[5](#fn_455)
bedstead--an âha*kk*a-pâdaka chair--had come into the possession of the
Sa*m*gha.

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

They told this matter (in each case) to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, (each of these things).'

4\. Now at that time a rectangular chair <span
id="fr_465"></span>[1](#fn_456)--an arm-chair <span
id="fr_466"></span>[2](#fn_457)--a sofa <span
id="fr_467"></span>[3](#fn_458)--a sofa with arms to it <span
id="fr_468"></span>[4](#fn_459)--a state chair <span
id="fr_469"></span>[5](#fn_460)--a cushioned chair <span
id="fr_470"></span>[6](#fn_461)--a chair raised on a pedestal <span
id="fr_471"></span>[7](#fn_462)--a chair with many legs <span
id="fr_472"></span>[8](#fn_463)--a board (to recline on) <span
id="fr_473"></span>[9](#fn_464)--a cane-bottomed chair <span
id="fr_474"></span>[10](#fn_465)--a straw-bottomed chair--had come into
the possession of the Sa*m*gha.

They told this matter (in each case) to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, (each of these things).'

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

5\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus slept on lofty beds.

People coming on a visit to the Vihâra, when they saw them, murmured,
&c., saying, 'Like those who still live in the pleasure of the world.'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to sleep on lofty beds. Whosoever does so,
shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a <span id="fr_475"></span>[1](#fn_466).'

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu, when sleeping on a low couch, was
bitten by a snake <span id="fr_476"></span>[2](#fn_467).

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, supports to your bedsteads <span
id="fr_477"></span>[3](#fn_468).'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus used lofty supports to their
bedsteads, and rocked themselves with these bedstead supports, backwards
and forwards <span id="fr_478"></span>[4](#fn_469).

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to use lofty supports to your bedsteads.
Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I allow you such
supports up to eight inches in length.'

6\. Now at that time a quantity of string had come into the possession
of the Sa*m*gha.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to weave (a texture of string across) the
bedstead.'

Much string was taken up by (passing it round) the sides of the
bedstead.

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to pierce the sides of the bedstead, and thus
to weave the string across and across <span
id="fr_479"></span>[1](#fn_470).'

A cloth had come into their possession.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to use it as a carpet <span
id="fr_480"></span>[2](#fn_471).'

A mattress stuffed with cotton <span id="fr_481"></span>[3](#fn_472) had
come into their possession.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to comb out the cotton, and make the cotton up
into pillows <span id="fr_482"></span>[4](#fn_473) if it be of any of
these three kinds--cotton produced on trees, cotton produced on
creepers, cotton produced from Po*t*aki-grass.'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus made use of pillows half the
size of a man's body.

People who came on a visit to the Vihâras murmured, &c., on seeing this,
saying, 'Like those who still enjoy the pleasures of the world.'

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to make use of pillows half the size of a
man's body. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I allow
you, O Bhikkhus, to have pillows the size of a man's head.'

7\. Now at that time there was a festival on a high place <span
id="fr_483"></span>[1](#fn_474) at Râ*g*agaha. The people provided for
the use of high officials bolsters stuffed with wool, or cotton cloth,
or bark, or grass, or leaves. When the festival had been held they tore
open the covers of skin and carried them off. And the Bhikkhus saw much
wool, and cotton cloth, and bark, and grass, and leaves thrown away on
the spot where the festival had been held; and on seeing this, they told
the matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, bolsters <span id="fr_484"></span>[2](#fn_475) of
five kinds--those stuffed with wool, or cotton cloth, or bark, or grass,
or talipot leaves.'

Now at that time a bed coverlet had come into the possession of the
Sa*m*gha.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to cover a bolster with it.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus folded up bed bolsters on to chairs <span
id="fr_485"></span>[3](#fn_476), and chair bolsters on to bedsteads, and
the bolsters came to pieces.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, chairs and bedsteads covered (with upholstered
cushions to fit them).'

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

They covered the bedsteads and chairs without putting a cloth beneath
them <span id="fr_486"></span>[1](#fn_477), and the stuffing came out
from below.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, first to spread out a cloth under the
bedsteads or chairs, and then to upholster them.'

They tore off the coverings <span id="fr_487"></span>[2](#fn_478), and
took them away.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to bespatter (the coverings with dye) <span
id="fr_488"></span>[3](#fn_479).'

They still took them away.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to use coverings coloured in patches <span
id="fr_489"></span>[4](#fn_480).'

They still took them away.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to colour the coverings in patches only the
size of a man's hand <span id="fr_490"></span>[5](#fn_481).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_438"></span>[160:3](sbe20054.htm#fr_447) Kavâ*t*a. This is
the special word for door. Dvâra often roughly translated door, is not
really 'door,' but 'door-' or 'gate-way,' with special reference to the
aperture and not to that by which the aperture could be closed. The
latter word is also <span id="page_161">p. 161</span> different from
'door,' in that it is never used for the entrance into an inner chamber.
It is always the outer entrance (and the entrance at the front as
distinguished from the entrance at the back) of a house, or one of the
principal entrances to a walled town or village. See, for instance,
Pâ*k*ittiya XIX; *K*ullavagga VIII, 5, 1, VIII, 8, 1; *G*âtaka I, 63,
114, 346, 361, II, 63, 140.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[161:1](sbe20054.htm#fr_448) On this and the
following details, compare V, 14, 3, and the notes there.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[161:2](sbe20054.htm#fr_449) Thakîyanti:
literally, 'covered, or stopped, up.' The same word is used at
*K*ullavagga VIII, 1, 5, of closing up the lattices mentioned in the
next section (VI, 2, 2).

<span id="fn_441"></span>[162:1](sbe20054.htm#fr_450) Ugghâ*t*etvâ, an
expression used in VIII, 1, 1 of undoing the bolt (gha*t*ikâ) just
referred to.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[162:2](sbe20054.htm#fr_451) Yantaka*m*
sû*k*ika*m*, which is the only expression here used which has not
already occurred above at V, 14, 3. Buddhaghosa says, Yantaka-sû*k*ikan
ti ettha ya*m* ya*m* *g*ânâti ta*m* ta*m* yantaka*m*. Tassa
vivara-sû*k*ika*m* ku*ñk*ika*m* kâtu*m* va*tt*ati.

<span id="fn_443"></span>[162:3](sbe20054.htm#fr_452) See the note at V,
14, 3.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[162:4](sbe20054.htm#fr_453) Vedikâ-vâtapâna*m*
nâma *k*etiye vedikâ-sadisa*m* (B.). See our note on vedikâ above, V,
14, 2. These windows or lattices are mentioned in *K*ullavagga VIII, 1,
5; Mahâvagga I, 25, 18.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[162:5](sbe20054.htm#fr_454) *G*âla-vâtapâna*m*
nâma *g*âlaka-baddha*m* (B.). *G*âlam, literally 'net,' is given as a
word for 'window' at Abhidhânappadipikâ, verse 216. The expression
probably corresponds to our 'lattice,' and does not mean that an actual
net was used. Compare the Anglo-Indian 'jalousie.'

<span id="fn_446"></span>[162:6](sbe20054.htm#fr_455) Salâka-vâtapâna*m*
nâma thambhaka-vâtapâna*m* (B.). Possibly this means with slips of wood
arranged horizontally as in our venetian blinds.

<span id="fn_447"></span>[163:1](sbe20054.htm#fr_456) Vagguliyo. This
habit of the bat and its harmlessness are referred to in Milinda
Pa*n*ha, p. 404. Compare the Sanskrit valgulî.

<span id="fn_448"></span>[163:2](sbe20054.htm#fr_457) *K*akkalikan ti.
Ettha *k*olaka-pâda-pu*ñkh*ana*m* bandhitu*m* anu*g*ânâmî ti attho (B.).
The word *k*akkali occurs below, VI, 19, probably in the sense here
meant.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[163:3](sbe20054.htm#fr_458) Vâtapâna-bhisî ti
vâtapâna-pamâ*n*ena bhisi*m* katvâ bandhitu*m* anu*g*ânâmî ti attho
(B.). Probably like the sand-bags used in England to keep out draughts.
On the use of the word in other connections, see our note on Mahâvagga
VIII, 13, 1, and the Old Commentary on Pâ*k*ittiya XIV (where five kinds
are named) with the Kankhâ-vitara*n*î on the last passage quoted by
Minayeff, p. 86.

<span id="fn_450"></span>[163:4](sbe20054.htm#fr_459) Mi*dh*im. See the
note on V, 9, 4. Native huts in Ceylon always have such solid benches
(of brick or mud covered with plaster) built up against the wall under
the verandah: and they are commonly used as sleeping-places for the
unmarried males <span id="page_164">p. 164</span> in the house.
Waska*d*uwa Subhûti has this in his mind in the explanation he gives in
English of vedikâ (Abhidhâna-ppadîpikâ, verse 222), though he applies it
to the wrong word.

<span id="fn_451"></span>[164:1](sbe20054.htm#fr_460)
Bidala-ma*ñk*aka*m* nâma vetta-ma*ñk*a*m*, ve*l*u-vilîvâhi vâ vîta*m*
(B.). The word occurs in the *G*âtaka Commentary I, 9, lines 26, 34.
Compare the Sanskrit bidala and vidala.

<span id="fn_452"></span>[164:2](sbe20054.htm#fr_461) Masârako, on which
Buddhaghosa says nothing here; but on the Old Commentary to the 14th
Pâ*k*ittiya, where all the four words in this paragraph also occur, he
has the following note (see Minayeff, p. 68): Masârako ti ma*ñk*a-pâde
vi*ggh*itvâ tattha a*t*aniyo pavesetvâ kato--just the opposite therefore
of âha*kk*a-pâdako below. On a*t*ani, compare our note to the 87th
Pâ*k*ittiya. The four names recur, of chairs only, in the Old Commentary
on the 87th and 88th Pâ*k*ittiyas.

<span id="fn_453"></span>[164:3](sbe20054.htm#fr_462) Buddhaghosa, loc.
cit., says, Bundikâbaddho ti a*t*anîhi ma*ñk*a-pâde *d*a*m*sâpetvâ
pallaṅka-sa*m*khepema kato. The first word, bundika, may mean a small
bolt.

<span id="fn_454"></span>[164:4](sbe20054.htm#fr_463) Kulîra-pâdako ti
assa-men*d*âdîna*m* pâda-sadisehi pâdakehi kato: yo vâ pana ko*k*i
vaṅka-pâdako aya*m* kulîra-pâdako (B. loc. cit.). A bedstead or chair
with curved or carved legs, especially when carved to represent animals'
feet. Kulîra is a crab.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[164:5](sbe20054.htm#fr_464) Âha*kk*a-pâdako
ti. Aya*m* pana âha*kk*a-pâdako nâma ma*ñk*o aṅge vi*ggh*itvâ kato
hotîti eva*m* parato pâliya*m* yeva vutto. Tasmâ a*t*aniyo vi*ggh*itvâ
tattha pâda-sikha*m* pavesetvâ upari â*n*im datvâ kata-ma*ñk*o
âha*kk*a-pâdako ti veditabbo (B. loc. cit.). This is in agreement with
the Old Commentary on the 18th Pâ*k*ittiya in which this word already
occurs. Compare âha*kk*a in the Âyâranga Sûya II, 1, 1, 2, II, 1, 10, 6.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[165:1](sbe20054.htm#fr_465) Âsandiko.
Buddhaghosa says, Âsandako (sic) ti *k*aturassapi*th*a*m* vu*kk*ati. An
âsandi (cushioned chair) is forbidden at Mahâvagga V, 10, 4.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[165:2](sbe20054.htm#fr_466) U*kk*aka*m* pi
âsandikan ti va*k*anato ekato-bhagena dîghapî*th*am eva hi
a*tth*aṅgula-pâdaka*m* va*tt*ati (B.).

<span id="fn_458"></span>[165:3](sbe20054.htm#fr_467) Sattaṅgo nâma tisu
disâsu apassaya*m* katvâ ma*ñk*o (B.). On apassaya*m*, compare note 9.

<span id="fn_459"></span>[165:4](sbe20054.htm#fr_468) U*kk*ako pi
sattaṅgo. Compare note 2.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[165:5](sbe20054.htm#fr_469) Bhadda-pî*th*an ti
vetta-maya*m* pîtha*m* vu*kk*ati (B.). We follow Böhtlingk-Roth sub voce
bhadra-pî*th*a.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[165:6](sbe20054.htm#fr_470) Pî*th*ikâ ti
pilotika-baddha*m* pîtha*m* eva (B.). Childers says 'bench, stool.'
Compare Sanskrit pî*th*aka (in the addenda to the Petersburg
Dictionary).

<span id="fn_462"></span>[165:7](sbe20054.htm#fr_471)
E*l*aka-pâdaka-pî*th*a*m* nâma daru-pa*tt*ikâya upari pâde *th*apetvâ
bho*g*ana-phalaka*m* viya kata-pî*th*a*m* vu*kk*ati (B.).

<span id="fn_463"></span>[165:8](sbe20054.htm#fr_472)
Âma*l*aka-va*nt*ika-pî*th*a*m* nâma âma*l*akâkârena yo*g*ita*m*
bahu-pâda-pî*th*a*m* (B.). Compare tâlava*nt*a at V, 22, 2, and
tâla-va*nt*aka at V, 29, 4.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[165:9](sbe20054.htm#fr_473) Phalaka*m*.
Compare apassena-phalaka*m* at Mahâvagga I, 25, 12, and below,
*K*ullavagga VI, 20, 2.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[165:10](sbe20054.htm#fr_474) Ko*kkh*a*m* nâma
vâkamaya*m* vâ usîramaya*m* vâ mu*ñg*amaya*m* vâ babbagamaya*m* vâ anto
sa*m*ve*th*etvâ baddha*m* hoti, says the Old Commentary on the 14th
Pâ*k*ittiya. Buddhaghosa gives here the same explanation, omitting vâka.

<span id="fn_466"></span>[166:1](sbe20054.htm#fr_475) Compare the 8th
*K*ûla Sîla (Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 191).

<span id="fn_467"></span>[166:2](sbe20054.htm#fr_476) Compare
*K*ullavagga V, 6.

<span id="fn_468"></span>[166:3](sbe20054.htm#fr_477)
Ma*ñk*a-pa*t*ipâdaka*m* mentioned in Mahâvagga I, 25, 16.

<span id="fn_469"></span>[166:4](sbe20054.htm#fr_478) Pavedhenti. The
reading is doubtful, but the suggestion at p. 321 of the text must be
withdrawn.

<span id="fn_470"></span>[167:1](sbe20054.htm#fr_479) A*tth*apadaka*m*
vetu*m*. Buddhaghosa says nothing, either here or at Mahâvagga VIII, 21,
where the word also occurs. A*tth*apada-*tth*âpana at *G*âtaka II, 5,
14, is a mode of dressing the hair, probably in broad plaits crossing
each other so as to resemble the squares of a chessboard.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[167:2](sbe20054.htm#fr_480) Or 'rug.'
*K*ilimikâ ti nâma parikammakatâya bhûmiyâ *kh*avi-sa*m*rakkhanatthâya
atthara*n*a*m* vu*kk*ati (B.). It is probably the same word as, or
connected with, *k*imilikâ, used by Buddhaghosa in note 5 on Mahâvagga
VII, 1, 5, and explained by him (in Minayeff, p. 87, line 5) as
tâla-pa*nn*âdîhi katâ. Both words are possibly diminutives of *k*ola,
and it is not improbable that the reading should be *k*ilimikâ in both
cases, as Buddhaghosa so spells the word again in his note below on VI,
2, 7.

<span id="fn_472"></span>[167:3](sbe20054.htm#fr_481) Tûlika. This is
undoubtedly what is meant to be forbidden in § 5 of the Ma*ggh*ima Sîla,
although Grimblot, 'Sept Suttas Palis,' p. 9, reads kulika*m*. See
Mahâvagga V, 10, 4.

<span id="fn_473"></span>[167:4](sbe20054.htm#fr_482) Compare IV, 4, 4,
VIII, 1, 3, where such pillows are mentioned among the ordinary
belongings of a Vihâra. The present rule is repeated below in VI, 14.

<span id="fn_474"></span>[168:1](sbe20054.htm#fr_483) Giragga-sama*gg*o.
See our note above on V, 2, 6.

<span id="fn_475"></span>[168:2](sbe20054.htm#fr_484) Bhisi. See the
note on this word at Mahâvagga VIII, 13, I.

<span id="fn_476"></span>[168:3](sbe20054.htm#fr_485) Buddhaghosa says
here ma*ñk*a-bhisi*m* pî*th*e sa*m*harantî ti ma*ñk*a-pî*th*e attharanti
attharanatthâya harantî ti yu*gg*ati (B.), On this use of sa*m*harati
compare above, V, 11, 7.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[169:1](sbe20054.htm#fr_486) Ulloka*m* akaritvâ
hetthâ *k*ilimika*m* adatvâ (B.). The word occurs again at Mahâvagga I,
25, 15 = *K*ullavagga VIII, 1, 3, where cobwebs are to be removed with a
cloth (ullokâ!).

<span id="fn_478"></span>[169:2](sbe20054.htm#fr_487) *Kh*avi*m*; but
perhaps not necessarily of leather. See the commencement of this
section.

<span id="fn_479"></span>[169:3](sbe20054.htm#fr_488) So that the
coverings would be useless for other purposes. The Pâli word is
positu*m*, which Buddhaghosa explains thus--hesitun ti (so the Berlin
MS.) ra*g*anena vâ haliddhâya vâ upari pusitâni dâtu*m*. The word is
evidently connected not with the root push, but with the roots p*ri*sh
and prush, 'to be, spatter;' and is the same as phositun at Mahâvagga
VI, 14, 5, which is probably the better reading of the two.

<span id="fn_480"></span>[169:4](sbe20054.htm#fr_489) Bhatti-kamma*m*.
The meaning is doubtful, because the reading is uncertain. Buddhaghosa
says, Bhitti-kamman ti (sic) bhisi-*kh*aviyâ upari bhitti-kamma*m*. The
word is probably analogous in formation to our English 'patchwork,'
though the 'patches' are not of pieces of different coloured stuffs, but
of bits of different colour spread over the same stuff, and whatever its
meaning, it is probably the same word as bhati-kamma at V, 9, 2.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[169:5](sbe20054.htm#fr_490) Again both reading
and interpretation are open to question. Hattha-bhittin ti
pa*ñk*aṅgula-bhitti*m* is all that Buddhaghosa <span id="page_170">p.
170</span> says; and we have followed in our translation the reading of
the Sinhalese MS. (see p. 321 of the edition of the text), which brings
the word into connection with the preceding phrase.
