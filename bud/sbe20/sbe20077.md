### 4.

1\. Now Devadatta on that day, which was Uposatha day, arose from his
seat, and gave out voting-tickets <span id="fr_724"></span>[1](#fn_710.md),
saying, 'We went, Sirs, to the Sama*n*a Gotama and asked for the Five
Points, saying--(&c., as above in VII, 3, 14 and 15). These the Sama*n*a
Gotama will not allow; but we live in accordance therewith. Whosoever of
the venerable ones approves of the Five Things, let him take a ticket.'

Now at that time there were five hundred Bhikkhus, Vesâliyans, and
belonging to the Va*gg*ian clan <span id="fr_725"></span>[2](#fn_711.md),
who had but recently joined the Order, and were ignorant of what he had
in hand <span id="fr_726"></span>[3](#fn_712.md). These took the
voting-tickets, believing \[the Five Points to be according to\] the
Dhamma, and the Vinaya, and the teaching of the Master. And Devadatta,
having thus created a division in the Sa*m*gha, went out to the hill
Gayâ-sîsa, taking those five hundred Bhikkhus with him.

Then Sâriputta and Moggallâna went to the Blessed One, and bowed down
before him, and took their seats on one side. And when they were so
seated, Sâriputta said to the Blessed One: 'Devadatta,

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lord, has gone
forth to Gayâ-sîsa, taking five hundred Bhikkhus with him.'

'Verily, Sâriputta and Moggallâna, there must be a feeling of kindness
towards those young Bhikkhus among you both. Go therefore, both of you,
before they have fallen into entire destruction.'

'Even so, Lord,' said Sâriputta and Moggallâna, in assent to the Blessed
One. And rising from their seats, they bowed down before him, and
keeping him on their right hand as they passed him, they set out for
Gayâ-sîsa.

Then at that time a certain Bhikkhu, standing not far from the Blessed
One, began to weep. And the Blessed One said to him: 'Why, O Bhikkhu,
dost thou weep?'

'Those, Lord, who are the Blessed One's chief disciples, Sâriputta and
Moggallâna, even they have gone to Devadatta's side, approving the
Dhamma of Devadatta.'

That, O Bhikkhu, would be impossible, that Sâriputta and Moggallâna
should approve his teaching. They are gone only to gain those Bhikkhus
over again <span id="fr_727"></span>[1](#fn_713.md):

2\. Now at that time Devadatta, surrounded by a great number of
adherents, was seated, preaching the Dhamma. And when he saw from afar
Sâriputta and Moggallâna coming towards him, he said to the Bhikkhus:
'See, O Bhikkhus, how well preached must be my doctrine, in that even
the two chief disciples of the Sama*n*a Gotama--Sâriputta

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

and Moggallâna--are coming to join me, being pleased with my Dhamma.'

When he had thus spoken Kokâlika said to Devadatta: 'O venerable
Devadatta, trust not Sâriputta and Moggallâna, for they are inclined
towards evil, and under the influence of evil desires.'

'Nay, my friend, let us bid them welcome since they take pleasure in my
teaching (Dhamma).'

And Devadatta invited Sâriputta to share his own seat, saying, 'Come,
friend Sâriputta. Sit thou here!'

'Nay (there is no need of that),' said Sâriputta; and taking another
seat, he sat down on one side. And Devadatta instructed and incited and
aroused and gladdened the Bhikkhus far into the night with religious
discourse; and then made request to Sâriputta, saying, 'The assembly,
friend Sâriputta, is still alert and sleepless. Will you, friend
Sâriputta, be so good as to think of some religious discourse to address
to the Bhikkhus <span id="fr_728"></span>[1](#fn_714.md)? My back is tired,
and I would stretch myself a little.'

'Even so, friend,' said the venerable Sâriputta, in assent to Devadatta.
And Devadatta spread his waist-cloth folded in four on the ground, and
lay down on his right side. And in a moment even sleep overcame him who
was tired, and had lost his presence of mind and his
self-consciousness <span id="fr_729"></span>[2](#fn_715.md).

3\. Then the venerable Sâriputta taught and exhorted the Bhikkhus in a
religious discourse touching the marvels of preaching, and the venerable

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Moggallâna taught
and exhorted the Bhikkhus in a religious discourse touching the marvels
of Iddhi. And whilst they were being so taught and exhorted those
Bhikkhus obtained the pure and spotless Eye of the Truth <span
id="fr_730"></span>[1](#fn_716)--(that is, the knowledge that.md)
whatsoever has a beginning, in that is inherent also the necessity of
dissolution. Then the venerable Sâriputta addressed the Bhikkhus, and
said: 'Let us go, my friends, to the Blessed One's side. Whosoever
approves of his doctrine (Dhamma), let him come.'

And Sâriputta and Moggallâna went back to the Ve*l*uvana, taking those
five hundred Bhikkhus with them. But Kokâlika awoke Devadatta, and said:
'Arise, friend Devadatta! Your Bhikkhus have been led away by Sâriputta
and Moggallâna. Did I not tell you, Devadatta, not to trust Sâriputta
and Moggallâna, in that they were inclined towards evil, and were under
the influence of evil desires?'

Then hot blood came forth from Devadatta's mouth <span
id="fr_731"></span>[2](#fn_717.md).

4\. But Sâriputta and Moggallâna went to the place where the Blessed One
was, and bowed down before him, and took their seats on one side. And
when they were so seated, Sâriputta said to the Blessed One:

'It were well, Lord, that Bhikkhus who have turned aside to schism
should be received afresh into the higher grade of the Order.'

'Nay, Sâriputta, let not the reordination of schismatical

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bhikkhus seem good
to thee. But rather cause such Bhikkhus to confess that they have
committed a thulla*kk*aya offence. And how, Sâriputta, did Devadatta
treat you?'

'When Devadatta, Lord, had instructed and aroused and incited and
gladdened the Bhikkhus far into the night with religious discourse, he
then 'made request to me, saying, "The assembly, friend Sâriputta, is
still alert and sleepless. Will you, friend Sâriputta, think of some
religious discourse to address to the Bhikkhus? My back is tired, and I
would stretch myself a little." This, Lord, was the way in which
Devadatta behaved to me.'

5\. Then the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'Once upon a
time, O Bhikkhus, there was a great pond in a forest region. Some
elephants dwelt beside it; and they, plunging into the pond, plucked
with their trunks the edible stalks of the lotus plants, washed them
till they were quite clean <span id="fr_732"></span>[1](#fn_718.md),
masticated them <span id="fr_733"></span>[2](#fn_719.md) without any dirt,
and so eat them up. And that produced in them both beauty and strength,
and by reason thereof they neither went down into death, nor into any
sorrow like unto death. Now among those great elephants, O Bhikkhus,
there were young elephant calves, who also, in imitation of those
others, plunged into that pond, and plucked with their trunks the edible
stalks of the lotus plants; but they did not wash them till they were
clean, but masticated them, dirt and all, and so eat them up. And that
produced in them

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

neither beauty nor strength; and by reason thereof they went down into
death, and into sorrows like unto death. Just so, O Bhikkhus, will
Devadatta die who, poor creature, is emulating me.

'Like the elephant calf who eateth mud in imitation, of the great
beast <span id="fr_734"></span>[1](#fn_720.md)

That shakes the earth, and eats the lotus plant, and watches through the
night among the waters <span id="fr_735"></span>[2](#fn_721.md)--

So will he, poor creature, die that emulateth me.'

6\. 'A Bhikkhu who is possessed of eight qualifications is worthy, O
Bhikkhus, to do the work of an emissary. And what are the eight? The
Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, must be able to hear and to make others listen,
able to learn, able to bear in mind, able to discern and to make others
discern, skilful to deal with friends and foes, and no maker of
quarrels. These are the eight qualifications of which when a Bhikkhu is
possessed, he is worthy, O Bhikkhus, to do the work of an emissary.

'Sâriputta, O Bhikkhus, being possessed of eight qualifications, is
worthy to do the work of an emissary. What are the eight (&c., as in
last paragraph)?

'He who on entering a company that is violent of speech, <span
id="page_262">p. 262</span>  
Fears not, forgoes no word, disguises not his message,  
Is unambiguous in what he says, and being questioned angers not,  
Of such is surely the Bhikkhu worthy to go on a mission <span
id="fr_736"></span>[1](#fn_722.md).'

7\. 'Devadatta, O Bhikkhus, being overcome, his mind being taken up by
eight evil conditions <span id="fr_737"></span>[2](#fn_723.md), is
irretrievably (doomed to) remain for a Kalpa in states of suffering and
woe <span id="fr_738"></span>[3](#fn_724.md). And what are the eight? He is
overcome, his mind is taken up by gain, by want of gain, by fame, by
want of fame, by honour, by want of honour, by his having wicked
desires, and by his having wicked friends. These, O Bhikkhus, are the
eight evil conditions by which Devadatta being overcome, and his mind
being taken up, he is irretrievably(doomed to) remain for a Kalpa in
states of suffering and woe.

'It would be well, O Bhikkhus, that Bhikkhus should continue in complete
ascendancy over any gain or loss, any fame or the reverse, any honour or

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

dishonour, any evil longing or evil friendship, that may accrue to them.
And for what reason <span id="fr_739"></span>[1](#fn_725.md)? For as much,
O Bhikkhus, that bad influences (âsavas) arise, full of vexation and
distress <span id="fr_740"></span>[2](#fn_726.md), to one who is not
continuing in complete ascendancy over each of these eight things, but
to one, who is so continuing, such influences arise not. This is the
reason, O Bhikkhus, why it would be well (&c., as before). Let us then,
O Bhikkhus, continue in complete ascendancy over any gain or loss, any
fame or the reverse, any honour or dishonour, any evil longing or evil
friendship, that may accrue to us. And thus, O Bhikkhus, should you
train yourselves.

There are three evil conditions, O Bhikkhus, by which Devadatta being
overcome, and his mind being taken up, he is irretrievably doomed to
remain for a Kalpa in states of suffering and woe. And what are the
three? His having wicked desires, and his having wicked friends, and his
having come to a stop on his way (to Nirvâ*n*a or Arahatship) because he
had already attained to some lesser thing <span
id="fr_741"></span>[3](#fn_727). These are the three (&c., as before.md).'

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

8\. "Verily! let no wicked desire whatever arise within you!  
Know rather from this what is the outcome thereof.  
Known was he as wise, reputed to be trained;  
Aglow with glory did Devadatta stand' (thus have I heard).  
He gave himself to vanity, to attacking <span
id="fr_742"></span>[1](#fn_728.md) the Tathâgata:  
He fell into the Avî*k*i hell, guarded fourfold and terrible <span
id="fr_743"></span>[2](#fn_729.md).  
The injurer of the good, of the man who does no wrong,  
Him sin pervades, the man of cruel heart, and void of love.  
Though one should think the ocean to befoul with but one poison pot,  
Yet could he not befoul it, for awful <span
id="fr_744"></span>[3](#fn_730.md) is the sea, and great;  
Just so though one should injure the Tathâgata by words,--

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

That perfect one, that peaceful heart,--against him the words would not
avail.  
Let the wise Bhikkhu make a friend of, and resort to him  
By following whose way he will come to the end of griefs!"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_710"></span>[256:1](sbe20077.htm#fr_724.md) It may be noticed
that Devadatta here takes upon himself the office of a salâka-gâhâpako
without having been appointed to it in the manner required by the rule
laid down in *K*ullavagga IV, 9 and 10. On the process to be followed
when voting with tickets, see IV, 4, 26.

<span id="fn_711"></span>[256:2](sbe20077.htm#fr_725.md) So it is the
Va*gg*ians from Vesâlî who are represented, below XII, 1, 1, to have put
forward those Ten Points which gave rise to the Council and the schism
at Vesâlî a hundred years after the Buddha's death.

<span id="fn_712"></span>[256:3](sbe20077.htm#fr_726.md) Apakata*ññ*uno.

<span id="fn_713"></span>[257:1](sbe20077.htm#fr_727.md)
Bhikkhu-sa*ññ*attiyâ. The phrase occurs above at IV, 14, 26, and below
XII, 2, 8, and corresponds to the expression *g*ana*m* sa*ññ*âpeti
(above, VII, 3, 14), used of Devadatta's trying to gain the people over
to his views.

<span id="fn_714"></span>[258:1](sbe20077.htm#fr_728.md) Pa*t*ibhâtu ta*m*
bhikkhûna*m* dhammî kathâ. See our note above on Mahâvagga V, 13, 9.

<span id="fn_715"></span>[258:2](sbe20077.htm#fr_729.md) Compare Mahâvagga
VIII, 16 = Sutta-vibhaṅga, Sa*m*ghâdisesa I, 2, 1.

<span id="fn_716"></span>[259:1](sbe20077.htm#fr_730.md) This expression is
the standing one in conversions; see, for instance, Mahâvagga I, 7, 6;
*K*ullavagga VI, 4, 5, VII, 3, 6.

<span id="fn_717"></span>[259:2](sbe20077.htm#fr_731.md) The later legends
preserved in Spence Hardy and Bigandet say that Devadatta died on the
spot.

<span id="fn_718"></span>[260:1](sbe20077.htm#fr_732.md) The last three
lines have occurred word for word in Mahâvagga VI, 20, 2.

<span id="fn_719"></span>[260:2](sbe20077.htm#fr_733.md) Sa*m*khâditvâ.
Compare the use of this word at *G*âtaka I, 507.

<span id="fn_720"></span>[261:1](sbe20077.htm#fr_734.md) Mahâ-varâha. At
Abhidhâna-ppadîpikâ, verse 1115, varâha is said to mean 'elephant' as
well as 'boar;' and so here Buddhaghosa says Mahâ-varâhassa
mahâ-nâgassa. As this explanation possibly rests only on such passages
as the present, we have chosen an ambiguous rendering.

<span id="fn_721"></span>[261:2](sbe20077.htm#fr_735.md) Nadîsu *g*aggato
ti. Ettha so kira hatthi-nâgo sâya*n*hasamaya*m* ta*m* nadî-nâmaka*m*
pokkhara*n*i*m* ogâhetvâ kilanto sabbaratti*m* vîtinâmesi gâlika*m*
karoti. Tena vutta*m* nadisu *g*aggato ti (B.).

<span id="fn_722"></span>[262:1](sbe20077.htm#fr_736.md) On these lines
compare some similar expressions at Mahâvagga X, 6, 3.

<span id="fn_723"></span>[262:2](sbe20077.htm#fr_737.md) Asaddhamma. It is
very difficult to find a proper rendering for this expression. Dhamma
here means, no doubt, 'quality,' 'condition' (as it does in the title of
the Sanskrit work Saddharma-pu*nd*arîka, unhappily rendered by Burnouf,
'Lotus de la bonne loi'). But the details of the various particulars
suggest rather the rendering 'surrounding occurrences' or 'matters,' for
they are objective, external, and not (or only incidentally and
secondarily) subjective, internal.

<span id="fn_724"></span>[262:3](sbe20077.htm#fr_738.md) Âpâyiko nerayiko.
'Liable to re-birth in apâya and in niraya: Of these the former includes
the latter, and also the states of being an animal, a disembodied ghost
(peta), or an asura. Hell, though a convenient, is a misleading
translation of the latter of the two words, for the reasons given by Rh.
D. on Mahâ-parinibbâna Sutta I, 23. All the expressions used here recur
below at VII, 5, 4.

<span id="fn_725"></span>[263:1](sbe20077.htm#fr_739) Kim (read kam.md)
atthavasa*m* pa*t*i*kk*a. So also above, Mahâvagga VIII, 15, 7;
*K*ullavagga VII, 1, 6, and in the Mahâ-parinibbâna Sutta V, 28, and
Dhammapada, verse 289. The whole of the previous sentence is here
repeated in the text.

<span id="fn_726"></span>[263:2](sbe20077.htm#fr_740.md)
Vighâta-pari*l*âhâ. This is a standing epithet of the Âsavas, recurring,
for instance, many times in the Sabbâsava Sutta, §§ 18-37 (Rh. D.'s
'Buddhist Suttas,' pp. 302 and following). The word 'influence,' here
chosen as a rendering for âsava, is suggested by Dr. Morris as being
similar, both in its derivation and in the history of its meaning, to
the Pâli one. The principal objection against it is that it has never
acquired the bad connotation of âsava, and requires, therefore, to be
supplemented by some epithet.

<span id="fn_727"></span>[263:3](sbe20077.htm#fr_741.md) Oramattakena
visesâdhigamena antarâ vosânam âpâdi. On this phrase, which recurs in
full in the Mahâ-parinibbâna <span id="page_264">p. 264</span> Sutta, I,
7, see Buddhaghosa's note there, quoted by Rh. D., 'Buddhist Suttas,' p.
7. The 'lesser thing' here referred to is doubtless the pothu*gg*anikâ
iddhi mentioned above in § 4:

<span id="fn_728"></span>[264:1](sbe20077.htm#fr_742.md) Anu*k*i*nn*o
âsa*gg*ana*m*. On the former of these two words the passages at
Dîpava*m*sa I, 18, and *G*âtaka I, 20 (verse 126), and below, VII, 5, 2
= Mahâvagga X, 5, 4, may be referred to. The latter seems to bear the
same relation to âsâdana, 'attack,' as vikubbana does to vikara*n*a.
Buddhaghosa's notes (text. p. 325) presuppose different. readings of
both words.

<span id="fn_729"></span>[264:2](sbe20077.htm#fr_743.md) 'Guarded fourfold'
is *k*atudvâra*m*, that is, 'having gates and the ramparts (through
which they pass) on all four sides.' On the general sentiment of these
stanzas, and especially of this line, compare the Kokâliya Sutta in the
Sutta Nipâta (III, 10).

<span id="fn_730"></span>[264:3](sbe20077.htm#fr_744.md) Bhasmâ is
explained by Buddhaghosa as equal to bhayânako.
