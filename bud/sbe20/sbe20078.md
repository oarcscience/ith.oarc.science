### 5.

1\. Now the venerable Upâli went up to the Blessed One, and bowed down
before him, and took his seat on one side. And when he was so seated,
the venerable Upâli said to the Blessed One: 'The expressions, Lord,
"disunion in the Sa*m*gha," and "schism in the Sa*m*gha," are used <span
id="fr_745"></span>[1](#fn_731.md). How much, Lord, goes to make disunion
and not schism in the Sa*m*gha, and how much goes to make both disunion
and schism in the Sa*m*gha?'

'If one is on one side, Upâli, and two on the other side, and a fourth
makes a formal proposition, and gives them voting-tickets, saying, "This
is according to the Dhamma, and according to the Vinaya, and according
to the teaching of the Master. Take this (ticket) and give your sanction
to this (opinion)"--then this, Upâli, is disunion in the Sa*m*gha, and
not schism.

If, Upâli, two are on one side, and other two are on the other side, and
a fifth . . . . (and so on up to) and an eighth tell them something
(&c., as before)--then this, Upâli, is disunion in the Sa*m*gha, and not
schism.

'If, Upâli, four are on one side, and other four

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

are on the other side, and a ninth tell them (&c., as before)--then
this, Upâli, is both disunion in the Sa*m*gha, and it is schism <span
id="fr_746"></span>[1](#fn_732.md).

(A separation) of nine, Upâli, or of more than nine, is both disunion in
the Sa*m*gha, and it is schism.

'A Bhikkhunî, Upâli, cannot make (one of the requisite number to cause)
a schism, though she may help to produce a schism--nor a woman novice,
nor a Sâma*n*era, male or female, nor a layman, nor a laywoman. It is
only a Bhikkhu who is in full possession of all his privileges, and
belongs to the same communion, and is domiciled in the same
district <span id="fr_747"></span>[2](#fn_733.md) who can make (one of the
number requisite to form) a schism.'

2\. 'There is the expression, Lord, "schism in the Sa*m*gha." How much,
Lord, does it require to constitute a schism in the Sa*m*gha?'

'They put forth <span id="fr_748"></span>[3](#fn_734.md), Upâli, what is
not Dhamma as Dhamma (1), or what is Dhamma as not Dhamma (2), or what
is not Vinaya as Vinaya (3), or what is Vinaya as not Vinaya (4), or
what has not been taught and spoken by the Tathâgata as taught and
spoken by him (5), or what has been taught and spoken by the Tathâgata
as not taught

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

and spoken by him (6), or what has not been practised by the Tathâgata
as practised by him (7), or what has been practised by the Tathâgata as
not practised by him (8), or what has not been ordained by the Tathâgata
as ordained by him (9), or what has been ordained by the Tathâgata as
not ordained by him (10), or what is no offence as an offence (11), or
what is an offence as no offence (12), or what is a slight offence to be
a grievous offence (13), or what is a grievous offence to be a slight
offence (14), or what is (a rule regarding) an offence to which there is
an atonement as without atonement (15), or what is (a rule regarding) an
offence to which there is no atonement as admitting of atonement (16),
or what is a grave offence as not .a grave offence (17), or what is not
a grave offence as a grave offence (18). In these Eighteen Points they
hinder and mislead (their followers) <span
id="fr_749"></span>[1](#fn_735.md), and perform independently Uposatha, and
Pavâra*n*â, and (official) acts of the Sa*m*gha. So much, Upâli, does it
require to constitute a schism in the Sa*m*gha.'

3\. 'There is the expression, Lord, "concord in the Sa*m*gha." What,
Lord, does it require to constitute concord in the Sa*m*gha?'

'They put forth, Upâli, what is not Dhamma as not Dhamma (and so on
through the Eighteen Points down to the end).

 <span id="fr_750"></span>[2](#fn_736)4. 'To what (result of Karma.md),
Lord, does that

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

man give rise who brings about a schism in the Sa*m*gha when it is in
concord?'

'He gives rise, Upâli, to a fault (the result of which) endures for a
Kalpa, and for a Kalpa is he boiled in Niraya.'

"He who breaks up the Sa*m*gha is (doomed) to remain for a Kalpa in
states of suffering and woe <span id="fr_751"></span>[1](#fn_737.md).

He who delights in party (strife), and adheres not to the Dhamma, is cut
off from Arahatship:

Having broken up the Sa*m*gha when it was at peace he is boiled for a
Kalpa in Niraya."

'To what (result of Karma), Lord, does that man give rise who brings
about reconciliation in the Sa*m*gha when it has been split up?'

'He gives rise, Upâli, to the highest merit, and for a Kalpa is he happy
in heaven.

"Blessed is concord in the Sa*m*gha, and the support of those who are at
peace!  
He who delights in peace, adhering to the Dhamma, is not cut off from
Arahatship:  
On reconciling the Sa*m*gha, when it was at strife, he is happy for a
Kalpa in heaven."'

5\. 'Can it be, Lord, that one who breaks up the Sa*m*gha is
irretrievably (doomed) to remain for a Kalpa in states of suffering and
woe?'

'Yes, Upâli, that can be.'

'Can it be, Lord, that one who breaks up the Sa*m*gha is not doomed to
be reborn in states either of suffering or of woe; that he is not doomed
to remain so in such states for a Kalpa; and that he (his position) is
not irretrievable?'

'Yes, Upâli, that can be.'

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

'Who then, Lord, \[comes under the first head?\]'

'In case, Upâli, a Bhikkhu gives out what is not Dhamma as Dhamma,
directing his opinion and his approval and his pleasure and his
intention <span id="fr_752"></span>[1](#fn_738.md) (to what he says and
does); and in belief that the doctrine (he propounds) is against the
Dhamma, and that the schism resulting therefrom would be against the
Dhamma <span id="fr_753"></span>[2](#fn_739.md); and makes publication
thereof <span id="fr_754"></span>[3](#fn_740.md), giving out tickets, and
saying, "Take this (voting-ticket): approve this (opinion) <span
id="fr_755"></span>[4](#fn_741.md). This is Dhamma; this is Vinaya; this is
the teaching of the Master,"--a man, Upâli, who thus divides the
Sa*m*gha, is irretrievably doomed to remain for a K al pa in states of
suffering and woe.'

\[The above paragraph is then repeated in full, reading successively for
'in belief that the doctrine (he propounds) is against the Dhamma, and
the schism resulting therefrom would be against the Dhamma,' each of the
following clauses:--

(*b*) . . . in belief that the doctrine is against the Dhamma, but that
the schism resulting therefrom would be in accordance with the Dhamma .
. .

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

(*c*) . . . in belief that the doctrine is against the Dhamma, but in
uncertainty whether the schism resulting therefrom would be against the
Dhamma or not . . .

(*d*) . . . in belief that the doctrine is in accordance with the
Dhamma, but that the schism resulting therefrom would be against the
Dhamma . . .

(*e*) . . . in belief that the doctrine is in accordance with the
Dhamma, but in uncertainty whether the schism resulting therefrom would
be against the Dhamma or not . . .

(*f*) . . . in uncertainty whether the doctrine is against the Dhamma or
not, but in the belief that the schism resulting therefrom would be
against the Dhamma . . .

(*g*) . . . in uncertainty whether the doctrine is against the Dhamma or
not, and in the belief that the schism resulting therefrom would be
against the Dhamma . . .

(*h*) . . . in uncertainty whether the doctrine would be against the
Dhamma, and in uncertainty whether the schism resulting therefrom would
be against the Dhamma or not . . .\]

\[The whole paragraph is then again repeated, reading successively for
'gives out that which is not Dhamma as Dhamma' each of the Eighteen
Points given in full in VII, 5, 2.\]

6\. 'Who then, Lord, is one who breaks up the Sa*m*gha, and yet is not
doomed to be reborn in states either of suffering or of woe; is not
doomed to remain in such states for a Kalpa; and is not so doomed that
his position is irretrievable?'

'In case, Upâli, a Bhikkhu gives out what is not Dhamma as Dhamma \[and
so on successively

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

through the whole Eighteen Points\] without directing his opinion and
his approval and his pleasure and his intention thereto, and in the
belief that the doctrine he propounds is in accordance with the Dhamma,
and that the schism resulting therefrom would be so too <span
id="fr_756"></span>[1](#fn_742.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_731"></span>[265:1](sbe20078.htm#fr_745.md) Sa*m*gha-râ*g*i
and sa*m*gha-bhedo. See Mahâvagga X. 1, 6, where other expressions, not
here referred to, are also used.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[266:1](sbe20078.htm#fr_746.md) That is, stated
shortly, it requires the breaking up of a body of at the least nine
Bhikkhus to make a schism.

<span id="fn_733"></span>[266:2](sbe20078.htm#fr_747.md) Pakatatto
samâna-sa*m*vâsako samâna-sîmâya *th*ito. On the two last of these
expressions, see our notes on Mahâvagga IX, 4, 8. The first is there
wrongly rendered, and should be translated as it is here; see the
frequent passages in which the word occurs (e*g*. *K*ullavagga I, 5, 1;
I, 6, 1; I, 27, 1; II, 1, &c., where we have rendered it shortly 'a
regular Bhikkhu').

<span id="fn_734"></span>[266:3](sbe20078.htm#fr_748.md) The first ten of
the following list recur word for word in the Aṅguttara Nikâya I, 11,
1-20 (Adhammâdi-vagga), and the whole eighteen above in the Mahâvagga X,
5, 4, 5.

<span id="fn_735"></span>[267:1](sbe20078.htm#fr_749.md) Both the exact
Pâli form and the interpretation of these terms are uncertain.
Buddhaghosa's notes will be found at p. 325 of H.O.'s edition of the
text, and most probably we should there read parisa*m* in both cases.

<span id="fn_736"></span>[267:2](sbe20078.htm#fr_750.md) On the whole of
the following section, compare above, VII, 3, 16, where much of the
phraseology recurs.

<span id="fn_737"></span>[268:1](sbe20078.htm#fr_751.md) On this line see
our note above on VII; 4, 7.

<span id="fn_738"></span>[269:1](sbe20078.htm#fr_752.md) Vinidhâya
di*tth*i*m*, vinidhâya khanti*m*, vinidhâya ruki*m*, vinidhâya bhâva*m*.
These expressions all recur in the Sutta-vibhaṅga, Pâ*k*ittiya I, 2, 2
and following sections, where the question at issue is whether an
erroneous statement is, or is not, a conscious lie. The meaning of the
whole is clear, though each of the words is used in a rather uncommon
sense. On khanti, compare di*tth*e sute khanti*m* akubbamâno (of the
Arahat) at Sutta Nipâta IV, 13, 3, and the standing use of the verb
khamati, at the end of the Kammavâ*k*âs.

<span id="fn_739"></span>[269:2](sbe20078.htm#fr_753.md) Bhede
adhamma-di*tth*i; literally, 'in the schism (there will be) doctrine
that is against the Dhamma.'

<span id="fn_740"></span>[269:3](sbe20078.htm#fr_754.md) Anussâveti, which
is here equivalent to the technical 'publication' required in the
English law of libel and slander.

<span id="fn_741"></span>[269:4](sbe20078.htm#fr_755.md) See the note above
on VII, 4, 1.

<span id="fn_742"></span>[271:1](sbe20078.htm#fr_756.md) The sum of the
last two sections seems to come to this, that practically such a schism
as would have the awful effects set out above in § 4 would be impossible
in Buddhism. For not only is a formal putting forward and voting on the
false doctrine essential to schism as distinct from mere disagreement,
but the offending Bhikkhu must also be quite aware that the doctrine so
put forth is wrong, or at least doubtful, and also that the schism
resulting from his action will be, or will probably be, disastrous to
the Dhamma. In other words, the schism must be brought about by
deliberately putting forward a doctrine known to be false, or at least
doubtful, or with the express intention or hope of thereby injuring the
cause of the Dhamma (that is, of the Truth).
