### 14.

1\. Now at that time at Vesâlî a regular service of sweet food had been
established, the laity taking the duty in turns. The Bhikkhus, eating
the sweet food, became very sick with superfluity of humors in their
body <span id="fr_252"></span>[5](#fn_246.md).

Now *G*îvaka Komârabha*kk*a went to Vesâlî on

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

prescribe, O Bhikkhus, the use of the cloister and of the bath-room.'

2\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus walked up and down on a cloister on
uneven ground; and their feet were hurt.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make it level.'

The cloister had too low a basement, and was inundated with water <span
id="fr_255"></span>[1](#fn_249.md).

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make it with a high basement.'

The facing of the basement fell in <span
id="fr_256"></span>[2](#fn_250.md).

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of facing of three kinds--brick
facing, stone facing, and wooden facing.'

They found difficulty in getting up into it.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of stairs of three kinds--brick
stairs, stone stairs, and wooden stairs.'

As they were going up them, they fell off.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a balustrade.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus, when walking up and down in the cloister,
fell down.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to provide a railing <span
id="fr_257"></span>[3](#fn_251.md) for the cloister.'

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

Now at that time the Bhikkhus, when walking up and down in the open air,
were distressed by heat and by cold.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a hall for the cloister <span
id="fr_258"></span>[1](#fn_252.md),'

Straw and plaster fell (from the walls and roof) into the cloister-hall.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to first cover over (the walls and roof with
skins), and then plaster them. (And I allow the use of) whitewash, and
blacking, and red colouring, and wreath-work, and creeper-work, and bone
hooks, and cupboards, and bamboos to hang robes on, and strings to hang
robes on.'

3\. \[The whole of the above, from the basement down to the balustrade,
is repeated of the hot-bath house.\]

The bath house had no door.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a door, with door-posts and
lintel <span id="fr_259"></span>[2](#fn_253.md), with hollows like a mortar
(for the door to revolve in <span id="fr_260"></span>[3](#fn_254).md), with
projections to

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

revolve in those hollows <span id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_255.md), with
rings on the door for, the bolt to work along in <span
id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_256.md), with a block of wood fixed unto the
edge of the door-post and containing a cavity for the bolt to go into
(called the monkey's head <span id="fr_263"></span>[3](#fn_257).md), with a
pin <span id="fr_264"></span>[4](#fn_258) (to secure the bolt by.md), with
a connecting bolt <span id="fr_265"></span>[5](#fn_259.md), with a
key-hole <span id="fr_266"></span>[6](#fn_260.md), with a hole for the
string with which the door can be closed, and with a string for that
purpose <span id="fr_267"></span>[7](#fn_261.md).'

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

The lower part of the wattle and daub wall <span
id="fr_268"></span>[1](#fn_262) of the bath-room decayed (through damp.md).

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to face round the lower half of the wall (with
bricks <span id="fr_269"></span>[2](#fn_263).md).'

The bath-room had no chimney <span id="fr_270"></span>[3](#fn_264.md).

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a chimney.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus made a fire-place in the middle of a small
bath-room, and there was no room to get to (the bath).

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make the fire-place at one side of a small
bath-room, and in the middle of a large one <span
id="fr_271"></span>[4](#fn_265.md).'

The fire in the bath-room scorched their faces.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of clay to spread over your
faces <span id="fr_272"></span>[5](#fn_266.md).'

They moistened the clay in their hands.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a trough to moisten the clay
in <span id="fr_273"></span>[6](#fn_267.md).'

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

The clay had a bad smell.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to scent it.'

The fire in the bath-room scorched their bodies.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to have water poured over you.'

They poured the water out of dishes and alms-bowls.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, a stand for the water, and saucers <span
id="fr_274"></span>[1](#fn_268.md) to pour it from.'

A bath-room with a thatched roof did not produce perspiration.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to cover the roof of the bath-room (with
skins <span id="fr_275"></span>[2](#fn_269).md), and to plaster it within
and without.'

The bath-room became swampy.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to lay the floor with flooring of three
kinds--brick flooring, stone flooring, and wooden flooring.'

It still became swampy.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to wash the floor.'

The water settled on the floor.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a drain to carry off the
water <span id="fr_276"></span>[3](#fn_270.md).'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus sat in the bath-room on the ground, and
they had pins and needles in their limbs <span
id="fr_277"></span>[4](#fn_271.md).

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of stools for the bath-room.'

Now at that time the bath-room had no enclosure.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to enclose it with three kinds of
enclosures--brick walls, and stone walls, and wooden fences.'

4\. There was no antechamber <span id="fr_278"></span>[1](#fn_272.md) (in
which the water could be kept).

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to have an antechamber.'

The basement of the antechamber was too low, and it was inundated with
water \[and so on, as in II. 6, and in the last section down to the end
of the description of the door, followed by the closing words of II. 6
and of § 2 from 'straw and plaster fell, &c.,' down to 'cupboards <span
id="fr_279"></span>[2](#fn_273.md)'\].

5\. The cell <span id="fr_280"></span>[3](#fn_274.md) became swampy.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to spread gravel <span
id="fr_281"></span>[4](#fn_275.md) over it.'

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

They did not succeed in getting any <span
id="fr_282"></span>[1](#fn_276.md).

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to flag it with stone.'

The water settled on the floor.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to have a drain to it.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_246"></span>[102:5](sbe20029.htm#fr_252.md) Abhisannakâyâ ti
semhâdi-dos’-ussanna-kâyâ (B.). This word has already occurred at
Mahâvagga VI, 14, 7, where Buddhaghosa's explanation is much the same.
See also Mahâvagga VIII, 1, 30.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

some business or other. And on seeing the Bhikkhus very sick with
superfluity of humors, he went up to where the Blessed One was; and when
he had come there, he saluted the Blessed One and took his seat on one
side. And when so seated he said to the Blessed One: 'The Bhikkhus, Lord
are now very sick with superfluity of humors. It would be well if the
Blessed One were to prescribe, Lord for the Bhikkhus the use of the
cloister <span id="fr_253"></span>[1](#fn_247.md) and of the
bath-room <span id="fr_254"></span>[2](#fn_248.md). Thus will the Bhikkhus
become convalescent.'

Then the Blessed One instructed, and aroused, and incited, and gladdened
*G*îvaka Komârabha*kk*a with religious discourse. And *G*îvaka
Komârabha*kk*a; so instructed, and incited, and aroused, and gladdened
with religious discourse, arose from his seat and saluted the Blessed
One, and keeping him on his right hand as he passed him, departed
thence. And the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection,
convened an assembly of the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha, and addressed the
Bhikkhus, and said, 'I

<span id="fn_247"></span>[103:1](sbe20029.htm#fr_253.md) *K*aṅkama. A
straight piece of ground cleared and levelled for the purpose of walking
up and down upon for exercise and meditation. See our note on this word
at Mahâvagga V, 1, 14.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[103:2](sbe20029.htm#fr_254.md) *G*antâghara. See
our note above on Mahâvagga I, 25, 12. It was not ordinarily used for
cold baths, which were taken in the rivers or tanks, but for a kind of
hot-water bath, or perhaps steam bath, the exact mode of taking or
administering which is not as yet certain. Several Bhikkhus took the
bath at the same time, but it is not likely that they got into the water
(though the expression uttarati is used, loc. cit., of their leaving the
bath), as they scarcely would have made vessels large enough to contain
a man. It rather seems that they sat on stools close to a large fire,
and had water poured over them. The use of this kind of bath is
forbidden to the Bhikkhunîs at *K*ullavagga X, 27, 4.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[104:1](sbe20029.htm#fr_255.md) All the following
paragraphs are the same as above, V, 11, 6, where see our notes.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[104:2](sbe20029.htm#fr_256.md) As we have pointed
out above, in our note on Mahâvagga V, 1, 14, it is not probable that
the Kaṅkama at first had a roof and stairs and balustrade. These were
later improvements.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[104:3](sbe20029.htm#fr_257.md) Vedikâ. See
Mahâ-sudassana Sutta I, 60, and Rh. D.'s note there ('Buddhist Suttas,'
p. 262), and below, VI, 2, 2.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[105:1](sbe20029.htm#fr_258.md) *K*aṅkamana-sâla,
already referred to at Mahâvagga III, 5.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[105:2](sbe20029.htm#fr_259.md)
Pi*tth*a-sa*m*ghâ*t*a*m*. See Childers under saṅghâ*t*a, and the Samanta
Pâsâdikâ on the 19th Pâ*k*ittiya. Kavâ*t*a-pi*tth*a occurs in Mahâvagga
I, 25, 15, and in the Samanta Pâsâdikâ on Pâ*k*ittiya 19 (compare
upari-pi*tth*iti at *K*ullavagga VIII, 1, 1), and this and the two
following phrases below, VI, 2, 1. Buddhaghosa has nothing on them,
either here or there; and they were probably therefore in quite common
use even in his day. The whole of this paragraph recurs below, VI, 3, 7.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[105:3](sbe20029.htm#fr_260.md) Udukkhalika*m*.
Presumably the door had no hinges, but the upper and lower ends of one
side projected into hollows pre-pared for them in the lintel and the
threshold. This suggestion is confirmed by the connection in which these
words are used at VI, 2, I.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[106:1](sbe20029.htm#fr_261.md) Uttara-pâsaka*m*.
See the last note. Pâsaka recurs also in the next but one. Compare
aggala-pâsaga in Ayâraṅga Sutta II, 1, 5, 2.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[106:2](sbe20029.htm#fr_262.md) Aggala-va*tt*i
nâma dvâra-bâhâye samappamâ*n*o yeva aggalatthambho vu*kk*ati yattha
tîni *k*attâri *kh*iddâni katvâ sû*k*iyo denti (B.).

<span id="fn_257"></span>[106:3](sbe20029.htm#fr_263.md) Kapi-sîsaka*m*
nâma dvâra-bâha*m* vi*ggh*itva tattha pavesito aggala-pâsako vu*kk*ati
(B.). The word recurs in the Mahâ-parinibbâna Sutta V, 32, where it is
said of Ânanda that he kapisîsaka*m* âlambitvâ a*tth*âsi, just as in the
Mahâ-sudassana Sutta II, 24 it is said of the queen under similar
circumstances that she dvâra-bâha*m* âlambitvâ a*tth*âsi. Buddhaghosa's
commentary on the word in the former of these two passages is given by
Rh. D. in his note at p. 95 of the 'Buddhist Suttas.'

<span id="fn_258"></span>[106:4](sbe20029.htm#fr_264.md) Sû*k*ikâ ti tattha
(that is, kapi-sîsake) ma*ggh*e *kh*idda*m* katvâ pavesitâ (B.).
Apparently a pin to pass through the monkey's head so as to secure the
bolt in its place after it has been shot into the cavity. See the next
note and below, VI, 2, I.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[106:5](sbe20029.htm#fr_265.md) Gha*t*ikâ ti
upari-yo*g*itâ (B.). At *G*âtaka I, 360 (compare *K*ullavagga IX, 1, 2),
we are told of a man who dvârâni pidahanto sabba-dvâresu
sû*k*igha*t*ikâdayo datvâ tala*m* (sic, query tâla*m*) abhiruhitvâ
tattha pi dvâram pidahitvâ nisîdi. As the principal bolt was probably
called aggala (unless that were the name for the whole machinery), this
was some smaller bolt. And in *K*ullavagga VIII, 1, I an instance is
given of a man undoing the bolt (gha*t*ikam ugghâ*t*etvâ) of an
uninhabited vihâra, such as is referred to in VI, 2, I.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[106:6](sbe20029.htm#fr_266.md) Tâla*kkh*idda*m*.
See the end of VI, 2, 1, and Childers under the word tâ*l*o. Buddhaghosa
says nothing. The word tâla occurs in the last note.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[106:7](sbe20029.htm#fr_267.md)
Âvi*ñkh*ana-*kkh*iddam âvi*ñkh*ana-ra*gg*u*m*. These are said in VI, 2,
1 to be necessary because the door could not be put <span
id="page_107">p. 107</span> to, and doubtless have the meaning above
assigned to them. Âvi*ñk*i (or âvi*ñg*i?) at Sutta-vibhaṅga,
Sa*m*ghâdisesa II, 4, 9, means he drew towards himself; and Âvi*ñk*anâ
(âvi*ñg*anâ?), ibid. II, 2, 2, is used as an equivalent of âka*ddh*anâ,
which is much the same thing.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[107:1](sbe20029.htm#fr_268.md) Ku*dd*a-pâdo.
Compare Rh. D.'s note on Mahâ-parinibbâna Sutta V, 41. The phrase recurs
below of Vihâras at VI, 3, 4.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[107:2](sbe20029.htm#fr_269.md) Ma*nd*alika*m*
kâtun ti nî*k*a-vatthuka*m* *k*initu*m* (B.). *K*inâti is the technical
word for laying bricks one above another; the comment therefore means
'to line or face the lower part with bricks.' (Compare pokkharaniyo
i*tth*ikâhi *k*initu*m* at Mahâsudassana Sutta I, 58; Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist
Suttas,' p. 262, 'to face the ponds with bricks or tiles;' and on facing
a well below, V, 16, 2.)

<span id="fn_264"></span>[107:3](sbe20029.htm#fr_270.md) Dhûma-nettan ti
dhûma-nikkhamana-*kh*iddam (B.). The word is used of a surgical
instrument at Mahâvagga VI, 13, 2.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[107:4](sbe20029.htm#fr_271.md) A similar
paragraph occurs below, VI, 3, 3, of Vihâras.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[107:5](sbe20029.htm#fr_272.md) Mukha-mattika*m*.
See our note 4 on Mahâvagga I, 25, 12.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[107:6](sbe20029.htm#fr_273.md)
Mattikâ-do*n*ika*m*. See the last words of V, 16, 2.

<span id="fn_268"></span>[108:1](sbe20029.htm#fr_274.md) Sarâvaka*m*. See
Mahâvagga VI, 12, I, and *G*âtaka, vol. i, p. 8.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[108:2](sbe20029.htm#fr_275.md) Ogumphetvâ. See
above, V, II, 6, and our note there.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[108:3](sbe20029.htm#fr_276.md)
Udaka-niddhamana*m*. See *G*âtaka I, 175, 409, 425, 489, in which
passages an entrance to, or an exit from, a palace or a city is effected
respectively niddhamana-mukhena, niddhamana-dvârena, niddhamanena, and
niddhamana-maggena. Our phrase here recurs below, V, 35, 4.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[108:4](sbe20029.htm#fr_277.md) Gattâni
ka*nd*uvanti. Gattâni is nominative, not accusative. Compare Mahâvagga
VI, 14, 5, where ka*nd*uvati is used in the neuter sense. ('The sore was
irritable!)

<span id="fn_272"></span>[109:1](sbe20029.htm#fr_278.md) Ko*tth*ako. This
word means a room without a window; and it is used either of 1. 'a room
over a gateway,' or 2. 'a room used as a store-room.' (Compare Mahâvagga
III, 5, 6, 9; *K*ullavagga IV, 4, 6, 7, VI, 3, 7, 9, VI, 4, 10, IX, I,
2; and *G*âtaka I, 179, 227, 230, II, 168.) The whole of this paragraph
recurs below, V, 35, 4, of the ko*tth*aka to a privy; and the two
passages taker together show that an entrance room or passage, a porch
or ante-chamber, is meant, in which the water was kept ready for use For
that reason this particular kind of ko*tth*aka is elsewhere called, in
both connections, udaka-ko*tth*aka (Mahâvagga VI, 14, 3, of the
bath-room--where see Buddhaghosa's note quoted in our 'Vinaya Texts,'
vol. ii, p. 57--and Dhammapada, p. 103, of the privy). Buddhaghosa
explains it here by dvâra-ko*tth*ako; and it occurs again below, VIII,
8, 2, in the same sense.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[109:2](sbe20029.htm#fr_279.md) The last two items
in § 2 are supplied for this case also in the next chapter but one.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[109:3](sbe20029.htm#fr_280.md) Parive*n*a is
doubtless here, and below at VIII, 8, 2 in the same connection, a cell
used as a cooling-room, after the steam bath. Buddhaghosa says nothing
here, but gives a note below, V, 35, 4.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[109:4](sbe20029.htm#fr_281.md) Marumba. This word
occurs-in a description of different kinds of earths in the Old
Commentary on the 10th Pâ*k*ittiya<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>
(Sutta-vibhaṅga, Pâ*k*ittiya X, 2, I); and in a similar connection at
Dîpava*m*sa XIX, 2. Also below, V, 35, 4, VI, 3, 8.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[110:1](sbe20029.htm#fr_282.md) Na
pariyâpu*n*anti. See the use of this phrase at *K*ullavagga V, 5, 2.
