### 4.

1\. Now at that time the householder Anâtha Pi*nd*ika was the husband of
the sister of the Râ*g*agaha Se*tth*i. And Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the
householder went to Râ*g*agaha on some business or other. Now at that
time the Sa*m*gha, with the Buddha at its head, had been bidden by the
Se*tth*i of Râ*g*agaha for the morrow's meal. And the Se*tth*i of
Râ*g*agaha gave command to his slaves and work-people, saying, 'So get
up at early morn, my men, and cook congey, and cook rice, and prepare
curries, and pre-pare delicacies <span id="fr_532"></span>[1](#fn_522.md)!'

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

And it occurred to Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder, 'Now formerly this
householder was wont, when I arrived, to lay aside all other business,
and exchange the greetings of courtesy with me; but now he appears
excited, and is giving orders to his slaves and work-people. How can it
be? Is he taking in marriage, or is he giving in marriage, or has he set
a great sacrifice on foot, or has he invited the Mâgadhan Seniya
Bimbisâra, together with his retinue, for to-morrow's meal?'

2\. Now when the Se*tth*i of Râ*g*agaha had given commandment to his
slaves and his work-people, he went up to the place where Anâtha
Pi*nd*ika the householder was, and exchanged with him the greetings of
courtesy, and took his seat on one side. And when he was so seated,
Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder \[told him the thoughts that had passed
through his mind\].

'I am neither taking nor giving in marriage, O householder' (was the
reply), 'nor have I invited the Mâgadhan Seniya Bimbisâra to to-morrow's
meal. But a great sacrifice I have set on foot, for the Sa*m*gha, with
the Buddha at its head, has been invited for to-morrow's meal at my
house.'

'Did you, O householder, say "the Buddha?"'

'Yes, it was "the Buddha" that I said.'

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

\[And thrice the same question was put, and the same reply was given.\]

'Hard is it, O householder, to meet even with the mere expression in the
world--the news, that is, of "a Buddha, a Buddha <span
id="fr_533"></span>[1](#fn_523.md)." Would it be possible for us, at this
very time, to go and visit that Blessed One, the Arahat, the very
Buddha <span id="fr_534"></span>[2](#fn_524.md)?'

'It is not now, O householder, the proper time to pay a visit to the
Blessed One; but early on the morrow you shall go and visit him.'

Then Anâtha Pi*nd*ika, pondering of the visit he was about to pay, lay
down to sleep with his thoughts so bent upon the Buddha that thrice in
the night he arose, thinking the daylight had appeared.

3\. And Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder went up to the gate leading to
the Sîtavana, and celestial beings opened the gate. And as he emerged
from the city, the light disappeared and a thick darkness arose, and
fear and trembling and consternation sprang up within him, so that a
longing came upon him to turn back again from that spot. But Sîvaka the
Yakkha, himself the while invisible, caused a sound to be heard, saying:

'A hundred elephants, a hundred steeds, a hundred chariots with
mules <span id="fr_535"></span>[3](#fn_525.md),

'A hundred thousand virgins with their jewelled earrings on,--

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

'These are not worth, O householder, the sixteenth portion of one single
stride.

'Go on, go on, O householder! Advance, and not retreat, shall profit
thee.'

Then the darkness disappeared before Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder,
and a bright light arose, and the fear and trembling and consternation
that had sprung upon within him were appeased.

\[And a second and a third time the same thing happened, and the same
words were heard, and with the same result.\]

4\. And Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder arrived at the Sîtavana; and at
that time the Blessed One, who had arisen at early dawn, was walking up
and down (meditating) in the open air. And the Blessed One saw Anâtha
Pi*nd*ika the householder when he was coming from afar; and the Blessed
One left the place where he had been, walking up and down, and sat
himself down on the seat put out for him. And when he was so seated, he
addressed Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder, and said:

'Come hither, Sudatta!'

Then Anâtha Pi*nd*ika, glad and happy at the thought that the Blessed
One had addressed him by his name, went up to the place where the
Blessed

One was, and bowed down before him, falling at his feet, and said:

'I trust my lord the Blessed One has slept in peace!'

'He ever sleeps in peace, the Arahat who is free <span
id="fr_536"></span>[1](#fn_526.md),

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

'Who is not touched by lusts, but calm and free from sin <span
id="fr_537"></span>[1](#fn_527.md),

'Has broken all the bars (to freedom of the mind) <span
id="fr_538"></span>[2](#fn_528.md), has quenched the anguish in his heart,

'Has fixed peace in his mind, and peaceful, sleeps in peace <span
id="fr_539"></span>[3](#fn_529.md).'

5 <span id="fr_540"></span>[4](#fn_530.md). Then the Blessed One discoursed
to Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder in due order; that is to say, he
spake to him of giving, of righteousness, of heaven, of the danger, the
vanity, and the defilement of lusts, and of the advantages of
renunciation. And when the Blessed One saw that Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the
householder had become prepared, softened, unprejudiced, and upraised
and believing in heart, then he proclaimed that which is the special
doctrine of the Buddhas; that is to say, Suffering, its Origin, its
Cessation, and the Path. And just as a clean cloth from which all stain
has been washed away will readily take the dye, just even so did Anâtha

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pi*nd*ika the
householder obtain, even while sitting there, the pure and spotless Eye
of the Truth; (that is to say, the knowledge that) whatsoever has a
beginning, in that is inherent also the necessity of dissolution. Thus
did Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder see, and master, and understand,
and penetrate the Truth; and he overcame uncertainty, and dispelled all
doubts, and gained full knowledge, becoming dependent upon no one else
for his knowledge of the doctrine of the Teacher. And he addressed the
Blessed One, and said:

'Most excellent, Lord (are the words of thy mouth), most excellent! Just
as if a man were to set up that which is thrown down, or were to reveal
that which is hidden away, or were to point out the right road to him
who has gone astray, or were to bring a light into the darkness so that
those who had eyes could see external forms just even so, Lord, has the
Truth been made known to me, in many a figure, by the Blessed One. And
I, even I, betake myself, Lord, to the Blessed One as my refuge, to the
Truth, and to the Order. May the Blessed One accept me as a disciple, as
one who, from this day forth as long as life endures. has taken his
refuge in him. And may the Blessed One consent to accept at my hand the
to-morrow's meal for himself and for his Order of Bhikkhus.'

Then the Blessed One, by silence, granted his consent. And when Anâtha
Pi*nd*ika the householder perceived that his request had been granted,
he rose from his seat, and bowed down before the Blessed One, and
keeping him on his right hand as he passed him, he departed thence.

6\. Now the Se*tth*i of Râ*g*agaha heard that the

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Order of Bhikkhus
which has the Buddha at its head had been invited by Anâtha Pi*nd*ika
the householder for the morrow's meal. And the Se*tth*i of Râ*g*agaha
said to Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder: 'They say, O householder, that
you have invited the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha, with the Buddha at its head, for
the morrow's meal, and, you are but a stranger here. I will provide the
means <span id="fr_541"></span>[1](#fn_531.md), O householder, for you to
provide the Order of Bhikkhus, which has the Buddha at its head, with
food.'

'It is not necessary, O householder; I have means sufficient for the
purpose.'

\[And the townsman of Râ*g*agaha <span id="fr_542"></span>[2](#fn_532.md),
and Seniya Bimbisâra the Râ*g*a of Magadha, made the same offer in the
same words, and received the same reply.\]

7\. Then Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder, when the night was far spent,
made ready in the house of the Se*tth*i of Râ*g*agaha sweet food both
hard and soft, and had the time announced to the Blessed One, saying,
'The time, Lord, has come; and the meal is ready.'

And the Blessed One, when he had dressed himself in the early morning,
went duly bowled and

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

robed to the house of the Se*tth*i of Râ*g*agaha, and sat down there on
the seat spread out for him, together with the Order of Bhikkhus. And
Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder offered to the Order of Bhikkhus which
had the Buddha at its head the sweet food both hard and soft, waiting
upon them with his own hand <span id="fr_543"></span>[1](#fn_533.md). And
when the Blessed One had finished his meal, and had cleansed his hands
and his bowl, Anâtha Pi*nd*ika took his seat on one side; and, so
seated, he said to the Blessed One: 'May the Blessed One consent to
spend the rainy season of Was at Sâvatthi, together with the Order of
Bhikkhus.'

'The Tathâgatas, O householder, take pleasure in solitude.'

'I understand, O Blessed One; I understand, O Happy One' (was the
reply) <span id="fr_544"></span>[2](#fn_534.md).

Then the Blessed One, after he had instructed and aroused and incited
and gladdened Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder with religious discourse,
arose from his seat, and departed thence.

8\. Now at that time Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder had many friends
and' large acquaintance, and his word was held of weight <span
id="fr_545"></span>[3](#fn_535.md). When he had

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

brought the business he had in hand at Râ*g*agaha to its conclusion, he
set out towards Sâvatthi; and on the way he gave orders to people,
saying, 'Build dwellings, my good men, and make rest-houses ready, and
prepare gifts. A Buddha has appeared in the world, and that Blessed One
has been invited by me, and by this road will he come.' And those people
\[did all even as they were commanded\].

And when Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder had arrived at Sâvatthi, he
examined all the region round about it, saying <span
id="fr_546"></span>[1](#fn_536.md), 'Where now shall I fix the place for
the Blessed One to stay in, not too far from the town and not too near,
convenient for going and for coming, easily accessible for all who wish
to visit him, by day not too crowded, by night not exposed to too much
noise and alarm, protected from the wind <span
id="fr_547"></span>[2](#fn_537.md), hidden from men, well fitted for a
retired life?'

9\. And Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder saw that the garden of *G*eta
the Kumâra had \[all these advantages\]. And when he saw that, he went
to *G*eta the Kumâra, and said to him, 'Sir, let me have your garden to
make an Ârâma on it.'

'It is not, Sir, for sale, even for (a sum so great that the pieces of
money would be sufficient to cover it if they were) laid side by side.'

'I take, Sir, the garden at the price.'

'No, O householder, there was no bargain meant <span
id="fr_548"></span>[3](#fn_538.md).'

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

Then they asked the lords of justice whether a bargain of sale had been
made or not. And the lords decided thus: 'The Ârâma is taken, Sir, at
the price which you fixed.'

And Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder had gold brought down in carts, and
covered the *G*etavana with (pieces) laid side by side <span
id="fr_549"></span>[1](#fn_539.md).

10\. Now the gold that he had brought down the first time did not
suffice (after the rest of the garden was covered) to cover one small
space close by the gateway. So Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder told his
servants to go back and fetch more gold, saying he would cover that
piece also.

Then thought *G*eta the Kumâra, 'This can be no ordinary matter <span
id="fr_550"></span>[2](#fn_540.md) for which this householder is ready to
lavish so much gold!' And he said to Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder,
'It is enough, O householder. You need not have that space covered. Let
me have that space, and it shall be my gift.'

Then Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder thought <span
id="fr_551"></span>[3](#fn_541.md), 'This *G*eta the Kumâra is a very
distinguished and illustrious person. Great would be the efficacy of the
adherence of so well known a man as he to this doctrine and discipline.'
And he gave up that

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

space to *G*eta the Kumâra. And *G*eta the Prince erected thereon a
gateway, with a room over it.

And Anâtha Pi*nd*ika the householder built <span
id="fr_552"></span>[1](#fn_542.md) dwelling-rooms, and retiring-rooms, and
store-rooms (over the gateways), and service halls, and halls with
fire-places in them, and storehouses (outside the Vihâra) <span
id="fr_553"></span>[2](#fn_543.md), and closets, and cloisters, and halls
for exercise, and wells, and sheds for the well <span
id="fr_554"></span>[3](#fn_544.md), and bath-rooms, and halls attached to
the bath-rooms, and ponds, and open-roofed sheds <span
id="fr_555"></span>[4](#fn_545.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_522"></span>[179:1](sbe20056.htm#fr_532.md) Uttari-bhaṅga*m*.
Childers sub voce uttari is in doubt what the meaning of this phrase is.
It is no longer uncertain that the word means 'delicacy' of some sort.
Whether the term was more <span id="page_181">p. 181</span> precise, and
denoted some particular delicacy or not, is still doubtful. Compare the
passages quoted in our note above on Mahâvagga VI, 14, 3 (adding
*G*âtaka I, 186, and *K*ullavagga IV, 4, 5, VIII, 4, 4), which show that
it was eaten with boiled rice or congey; is mentioned along with ghee
and oil; and could be made from the flesh (or other parts) of a
sucking-pig. If it were not for the latter circumstance (*G*âtaka I,
197) it might well be pickles or chutney.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[181:1](sbe20056.htm#fr_533.md) 'Much more so with
the reality' is to be understood. Compare Mahâ-parinibbâna Sutta VI, 63
(at the end).

<span id="fn_524"></span>[181:2](sbe20056.htm#fr_534.md) On this rendering
of Sammâ-sambuddha*m*, see Rh. D.'s Hibbert Lectures,' pp. 145-147.

<span id="fn_525"></span>[181:3](sbe20056.htm#fr_535.md) Assatari. Compare
va*kkh*atarî at Mahâvagga V, 9, 1, 3. The word recurs below at VII, 2,
5.

<span id="fn_526"></span>[182:1](sbe20056.htm#fr_536.md) Brâhma*n*o
parinibbuto. To translate the first of these words by 'Brahman' would
mislead English readers. It is constantly used in early Buddhist texts
for Arahat. On the use of <span id="page_183">p. 183</span> parinibbuto
not in the sense of 'dead,' but of a living man in the sense of
'spiritually free,' compare Dhammapada, verse 89; Sutta Nipâta II, 13,
I, 12, III, 12, 35; and Mahâ-parinibbâna Sutta IV, 3.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[183:1](sbe20056.htm#fr_537.md) Nirûpadhi, i.e.
free from Kâma, Kilesa, and Kamma.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[183:2](sbe20056.htm#fr_538.md) Sabbâ âsattiyo
*kh*etvâ. Having cut or broken all the âsatti's (from the root sa*ñg*,
'to hang'), the things which hang on to and burden a man in his
spiritual progress. Compare the figure of speech at *G*âtaka I, 5
(âsatta*m* ku*n*apa*m* *kh*addetvâ). Buddhaghosa says sabbâ âsattiyo
*kh*etvâ ti . . . . hadaye daratha*m* *k*itte kilesa-daratha*m*
*g*inetvâ.

<span id="fn_529"></span>[183:3](sbe20056.htm#fr_539.md) Vineyya and appuya
are no doubt gerunds. In a corresponding passage of the Aṅguttara Nikâya
the Phayre MS. reads appeyya, which smoothes over a difficulty at the
expense of the better reading.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[183:4](sbe20056.htm#fr_540.md) The following
section is in identical terms with Mahâvagga I, 7, 5, 10, V, I, 9, 10,
VI, 26, 8, 9.

<span id="fn_531"></span>[185:1](sbe20056.htm#fr_541.md) Veyyâyika*m*
formed from vyaya, expenditure. Veyyâyikan ti vayakara*n*a*m* vu*kk*ati
(B.).

<span id="fn_532"></span>[185:2](sbe20056.htm#fr_542.md) Râ*g*agahako
negamo. This person has been already mentioned, and there also in
intimate connection with the Se*tth*i of Râ*g*agaha, in the Mahâvagga
VIII, 1, 2, 16. It is tolerably clear from the connection that this is
no ordinary citizen, but one holding a distinct and semi-official
position. In this respect the word is an exact parallel to its neighbour
the Se*tth*i. For instances of the word in its more general sense, see
Ka*kk*âyana (ed. Senart), p. 219, and Dâ*th*âva*m*sa III, 3.

<span id="fn_533"></span>[186:1](sbe20056.htm#fr_543.md) Compare the note
on Mahâvagga I, 8, 4.

<span id="fn_534"></span>[186:2](sbe20056.htm#fr_544.md) A*ññ*âta*m*
bhagavâ a*ññ*âta*m* sugatâ ti. The first word is the standing expression
used when the Buddha or a Thera has signified a request, not in so many
words, but in some phrase from which the request may be implied, and the
person addressed desires to express that he has perceived the intended
implication. Compare Dîpava*m*sa XIV, 65, XV, 5.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[186:3](sbe20056.htm#fr_545.md) Adeyyavâ*k*o ti
tassa va*k*ana*m* bahu*g*anâ mânetabba*m* ma*ññ*antî ti attho (B.). In
Puggala III, 11, we have the phrase tassa va*k*ana*m* âdheyya*m*
ga*kkh*ati, which the commentary explains by hadaye âdhâtabba*m*
*th*apitabba*m*.

<span id="fn_536"></span>[187:1](sbe20056.htm#fr_546.md) The following
speech is identical with that put into Bimbisâra's mouth on choosing the
Ve*l*uvana, above Mahâvagga I, 22, 16, 17.

<span id="fn_537"></span>[187:2](sbe20056.htm#fr_547.md) Vi*g*anavâta*m*,
of which neither the reading nor the meaning is certain. See the various
forms given from the commentaries in the notes on the text of the
passage in the Mahâvagga, loc. cit.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[187:3](sbe20056.htm#fr_548.md) Na gahito:
literally, 'it is not taken.'

<span id="fn_539"></span>[188:1](sbe20056.htm#fr_549.md) It is evident from
the illustration of this story on a bas relief at the Bharhut Tope that
these pieces of money were supposed to be square, not round. See
Cunningham's 'The Stûpa of Bharhut,' Plate No. LVII and pp. 84-86.

<span id="fn_540"></span>[188:2](sbe20056.htm#fr_550.md) Na oraka*m*
bhavissati. Compare Mahâvagga I, y, I, and the commencement of our next
chapter below. The idiom recurs in VII, 3, 3.

<span id="fn_541"></span>[188:3](sbe20056.htm#fr_551.md) The following
phrase is identical with that put into the mouth of Ânanda, at Mahâvagga
VI, 36, 3, with respect to Ro*g*a the Malla. In the text here there is a
slight misprint; the full-stop after *ñ*âtamanusso should be struck out.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[189:1](sbe20056.htm#fr_552.md) With the following
list should be compared the list of things that laymen build for
themselves given in Mahâvagga III, 5, 7.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[189:2](sbe20056.htm#fr_553.md) Kappiya-ku*t*iyo.
See Mahâvagga VI, 33.

<span id="fn_544"></span>[189:3](sbe20056.htm#fr_554.md) Udapâna-sâlâyo.
See above, V, 16, 2.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[189:4](sbe20056.htm#fr_555.md) Ma*nd*ape. See
Mahâvagga VIII, 1, 1, and above, *K*ullavagga VI, 3, 7.
