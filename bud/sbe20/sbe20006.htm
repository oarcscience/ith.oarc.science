<p>1. Now at that time the Bhikkhu Gagga was insane and out of his mind; and by him, when so insane and out of his mind, many things unworthy of a sama<I>n</I>a had been committed, as well in speech as in act&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. The Bhikkhus warned the Bhikkhu Gagga of a fault so committed by him when insane and out of his mind, saying, 'Does the venerable one call to</p>

<p>mind that he has committed such and such an offence?'</p>  
<p>He replied, 'I, my friends, was insane and out of my mind. (No doubt) many things unworthy of a sama<I>n</I>a, as well in speech as in act, may have been committed by me when so insane and out of my mind. But I do not recollect it. It was done by me by reason of my insanity.'</p>  
<p>But though they received that answer from him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, they warned him still, saying, 'Does the venerable one call to mind that he has committed such and such an offence?'</p>  
<p>'Those Bhikkhus who were moderate were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant, saying, "How can those Bhikkhus warn the Bhikkhu Gagga . . . saying . . . such and such an offence?" And when he replies, "I, my friends, was insane . . . by reason of my insanity"--how can those Bhikkhus still warn him, saying . . . of such and such an offence?'</p>  
<p>And those Bhikkhus told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, that those Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before, down to) such and such an offence?'</p>  
<p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>

<p>'Let that Bhikkhu Gagga [here follow the words of the formal request, of the resolution, and of the grant by decision of the Sa<I>m</I>gha, exactly in the same way as in the last case, chapter 4, &sect; 10].'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_34"></A><A HREF="sbe20006.htm#fr_35">18:3</A> Buddhaghosa explains this word as follows: 'Bh&acirc;sitaparikantan ti vi<I>k</I>&acirc;ya bh&acirc;sita<I>m</I> k&acirc;yena parikkanta<I>m</I> parikkametv&acirc; katan ti attho.' The similar word Parikanta<I>m</I>, which occurs in the Sutta-vibha&#7749;ga, P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika IV, 1, 2, in the sense of lacerated, is from the root k<I>ri</I>nt.</P>
