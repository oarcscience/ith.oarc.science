### 25.

1\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu was a ruminator <span
id="fr_348"></span>[1](#fn_341.md), and he, continually ruminating, used to
chew the cud.

The Bhikkhus murmured, were annoyed, and were indignant, saying, 'This
Bhikkhu eats food out of hours <span id="fr_349"></span>[2](#fn_342.md).'
And they told this matter to the Blessed One.

'This Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, has but lately fallen from the condition of
being an ox. I allow, O Bhikkhus, to a ruminator the chew of the cud.
But nothing, O Bhikkhus, brought from the door of the mouth to the
outside thereof is to be so chewed <span
id="fr_350"></span>[3](#fn_343.md). Whosoever does so, shall be dealt with
according to the law <span id="fr_351"></span>[4](#fn_344.md).'
