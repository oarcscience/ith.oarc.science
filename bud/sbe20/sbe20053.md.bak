# SIXTH KHANDHAKA.

#### ON DWELLINGS AND FURNITURE.

### 1.

1\. Now at that time the Blessed Buddha <span
id="fr_436"></span>[1](#fn_427.md) was staying at Râ*g*agaha in the
Ve*l*uvana, in the Kalandaka Nivâpa <span
id="fr_437"></span>[2](#fn_428.md). And at that time no permission had been
given to the Bhikkhus by the Blessed One with respect to dwellings. So
the Bhikkhus dwelt now here, now there--in the woods, at the foot of
trees, on hill-sides, in grottoes, in mountain caves, in cemeteries, in
forests, in open plains, and in heaps of straw. And at early morn they
came in from this place or from that place--from the woods (&c., as
before) decorous in their walking and turning, in their looking on or
looking round, in stretching out their arms or in drawing them back,
with eyes cast down, and dignified in deportment <span
id="fr_438"></span>[3](#fn_429.md).

2\. Now at that time the Se*tth*i of Râ*g*agaha went at early morn to
his garden. And the Se*tth*i of

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Râ*g*agaha saw
those Bhikkhus coming in from this place and from that place, from the
woods (&c., as in § 1, down to the end), and on seeing them he took
pleasure therein <span id="fr_439"></span>[1](#fn_430.md). And the Se*tth*i
of Râ*g*agaha went up to those Bhikkhus, and said to them:

'If, Sirs, I were to have dwellings erected for you, would you take up
your abode in those dwellings?'

'Not so, O householder. Dwellings have not been allowed by the Blessed
One.'

'Then, Sirs, ask the Blessed One about it, and let me know.'

'Very well, O householder,' said they, in assent to the Se*tth*i of
Râ*g*agaha. And they went up to the Blessed One, and saluted him, and
took their seats on one side. And when they were so seated, they said to
the Blessed One:

'The Se*tth*i of Râ*g*agaha, Lord, wishes to have dwellings erected for
us. What, Lord, should be done?'

Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, when he
had delivered a religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, abodes of five kinds--Vihâras, A*ddh*ayogas,
storied dwellings, attics, caves <span id="fr_440"></span>[2](#fn_431.md).'

3\. Then those Bhikkhus went up to the Se*tth*i of Râ*g*agaha, and said
to him: 'The Blessed One, Sir, has allowed us dwellings; do, therefore,
what seemeth to thee good.' And the Se*tth*i of Râ*g*agaha had sixty
dwelling-places put up in one day.

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

4\. And when the Se*tth*i of Râ*g*agaha had completed those sixty
dwelling-places, he went up to the place where the Blessed One was, and
\[invited him and the Bhikkhu Sa*m*gha for the morrow's meal; and so on,
as usual <span id="fr_441"></span>[1](#fn_432.md), down to the time when,
after the meal, the Se*tth*i\] said to the Blessed One:

I have had, Lord, these sixty dwelling-places made for the sake of
merit, and for the sake of heaven. What am I to do, Lord, with respect
to them?'

Then, O householder, dedicate <span id="fr_442"></span>[2](#fn_433.md)
these sixty dwelling-places to the Sa*m*gha of the four directions,
whether now present, or hereafter to arrive.'

'Even so, Lord!' said the Se*tth*i of Râ*g*agaha, in assent to the
Blessed One, and he dedicated those sixty dwelling-places to the use of
the Sa*m*gha of the four directions whether present or to come <span
id="fr_443"></span>[3](#fn_434.md).'

5\. Then the Blessed One gave thanks to the Se*tth*i of Râ*g*agaha in
these verses <span id="fr_444"></span>[4](#fn_435.md):

'1. Cold he wards off and heat, so also beasts of prey,  
And creeping things and gnats, and rains in the wet season.  
And when the dreaded heated winds arise, they are kept off.

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

2\. To give Vihâras to the Sa*m*gha, wherein in safety and in peace  
To meditate and think at ease, the Buddha calls the best of gifts.  
3. Let then the able man, regarding his own weal,  
Have pleasant monasteries built, and lodge there learned men <span
id="fr_445"></span>[1](#fn_436.md).  
4. Let him with cheerful mind give food to them, and drink,  
Raiment, and dwelling-places, to the upright in heart.  
5. Then shall they preach to him the Truth--The Truth dispelling every
grief  
Which Truth when here that man perceives He sins no more, and dies
away <span id="fr_446"></span>[2](#fn_437.md)!'

And when the Blessed One had given thanks to the Se*tth*i of Râ*g*agaha
in these verses, he rose from his seat, and departed thence.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_427"></span>[157:1](sbe20053.htm#fr_436.md) Our readers will
have noticed that the phrase at the beginning of each Khandhaka is 'the
Blessed Buddha,' and not merely 'the Blessed One.' It recurs besides
only in the constantly-repeated paragraph 'The Blessed Buddha rebuked
them, saying, &c.' (see, for instance, *K*ullavagga I, 1, 2, where the
connection is given in full).

<span id="fn_428"></span>[157:2](sbe20053.htm#fr_437.md) Compare the note
on Mahâvagga III, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[157:3](sbe20053.htm#fr_438.md) So also Mahâvagga
I, 23, 2, and frequently in the Suttas.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[158:1](sbe20053.htm#fr_439.md) So also of
Bimbisâra in the *G*âtaka Commentary, I, 66.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[158:2](sbe20053.htm#fr_440.md) Buddhaghosa's note
on these pa*ñk*a lenâni has already been given in our note above,
Mahâvagga I, 30, 4.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[159:1](sbe20053.htm#fr_441.md) See, for instance,
Mahâvagga VI, 30, or *K*ullavagga V, 27.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[159:2](sbe20053.htm#fr_442.md) Literally,
'establish' (pa*t*i*tth*âpehi).

<span id="fn_434"></span>[159:3](sbe20053.htm#fr_443.md) This formula of
dedication has been constantly found in rock-inscriptions in India and
Ceylon over the ancient cave-dwellings of Buddhist hermits. See Rh. D.
in the 'Indian Antiquary' for May, 1872.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[159:4](sbe20053.htm#fr_444.md) The following
verses recur below at VI, 9, 2; and also in that connection in the
*G*âtaka Commentary, I, 93.

<span id="fn_436"></span>[160:1](sbe20053.htm#fr_445.md) This verse forms
the subject of one of the 'Questions of Milinda' (ed. Trenckner, p.
211).

<span id="fn_437"></span>[160:2](sbe20053.htm#fr_446.md) The above verses
may have stood originally in a different con-text from that in which
they have been handed down, as the opening phrase sîta*m* pa*t*ihanti
would be more intelligible if the word vihâro occurred in the
immediately preceding clause.
