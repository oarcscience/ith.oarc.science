### 10.

1\. Now at that time it had been settled that a certain high official at
court, a follower of the Â*g*îvakas, should provide the day's meal for
the Sa*m*gha. And the venerable Upananda the Sâkyan, coming late, but
before the meal was over, made the Bhikkhu next (junior to him in
seniority <span id="fr_577"></span>[4](#fn_567).md) get

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

up out of his seat; and the dining-hall was thrown into confusion.

Then that minister became indignant, murmured, and was annoyed: 'How can
the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as behave so! Is it not then lawful for any one,
unless he have been seated, to eat as much as he requires?'

And the Bhikkhus heard him murmuring, &c. And they told the matter to
the Blessed One.

'Is it true as they say, &c.?'

'It is true, Lord.'

Then the Blessed One rebuked him, &c., and he said to the Bhikkhus, 'A
Bhikkhu is not, O Bhikkhus, to be made to get up out of his seat before
the meal is over. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. And
if any one causes another to get up, and be then invited to partake of
the meal, he shall be ordered to go and fetch water. If he shall thus
receive the place, it is well; if not, the other one shall first
complete his swallowing of the rice, and shall then give up the place to
his senior. But in no case, O Bhikkhus, do I say that a place properly
belonging to a senior Bhikkhu is to be taken (by a junior). Whosoever
does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a <span
id="fr_578"></span>[1](#fn_568.md).'

2\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus made sick Bhikkhus get
up (from their seats). The sick men said, 'We cannot, Sirs, get up; for
we are sick.'

'We insist upon your getting up,' said they; and

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

seizing them, and pulling them up, they let them go as they were
standing. The sick men, as soon as they were let go, fell down.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'A sick man, O Bhikkhus, is not to be made to get up. Whosoever does so,
shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus, saying, 'We are sick, and
cannot be turned out,' took possession of the best sleeping-places.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I enjoin, O Bhikkhus, that you allot to sick Bhikkhus suitable
sleeping-places.'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus, on pretext of some slight
indisposition <span id="fr_579"></span>[1](#fn_569.md), took exclusive
possession of sleeping-places.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to do so. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty
of a dukka*t*a.'

<span id="fn_567"></span>[198:4](sbe20062.htm#fr_577.md) Ânantarika*m*;
perhaps 'the Bhikkhu (who happened to be) <span id="page_199">p.
199</span> next (to him).' The text reads anantarika*m*, which is a
misprint. Compare Mahâvagga IX, 4, 8, and *K*ullavagga VII, 3, 9, VIII,
4, 1.
