### 14.

1\. Now at that time Bhikkhus had disputes with Bhikkhus, and Bhikkhunîs
with Bhikkhus. And the Bhikkhu *Kh*anna <span
id="fr_66"></span>[2](#fn_65), forcing his way (into the apartments.md) of
the Bhikkhunîs took the part of the Bhikkhunîs <span
id="fr_67"></span>[3](#fn_66.md), and disputed with the Bhikkhus.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

Those Bhikkhus who were moderate were indignant, &c. . . . told the
Blessed One, &c. . . . he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

2\. 'There are, O Bhikkhus, the following four kinds of legal questions
that require formal settlement by the Sa*m*gha; (that is to say), legal
questions arising out of disputes, legal questions arising out of
censure, legal questions arising out of offences, legal questions
arising out of business <span id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_67.md).

'Among these, what is a legal question arising out of dispute? This, O
Bhikkhus, is when Bhikkhus dispute, saying, "This is Dhamma," or "This
is not Dhamma," or "This is Vinaya," or "This is not Vinaya," or "This
is taught and spoken by the Tathâgata," or "This is not taught nor
spoken by the Tathâgata," or "This has been practised by the Tathâgata,"
or "This has not been practised by the Tathâgata," or "This has been
ordained by the Tathâgata," or "This has not been ordained by the
Tathâgata," or "This is an offence," or "This is not an offence," or
"This is a slight offence," or "This is a grievous offence," or "This is
an offence which can be done away," or "This is an offence which cannot
be done away <span id="fr_69"></span>[2](#fn_68.md)," or "This is a most
grave offence," or "This is not a most grave

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

offence." Whatsoever quarrel, strife, controversy, difference of
opinion, contradiction, opposition, cantankerousness <span
id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_69.md), or contention there may be on such a
matter, this is called a legal question arising out of dispute.

'And among these, which is a legal question arising out of censure?
This, O Bhikkhu, is when Bhikkhus charge a Bhikkhu with a fault of
morality, or of conduct, or of opinion, or of means of livelihood.
Whatsoever charge, censure, incrimination <span
id="fr_71"></span>[2](#fn_70.md), admonition <span
id="fr_72"></span>[2](#fn_70.md), candid opinion <span
id="fr_73"></span>[3](#fn_71.md), making of excuses <span
id="fr_74"></span>[4](#fn_72.md) for a person, or making fun of him, there
may be, that is called a legal question arising out of censure.

'And among these, what is a legal question arising out of offence? The
five groups of offences <span id="fr_75"></span>[5](#fn_73.md) are subjects
of legal questions of offences, and the seven groups of offences <span
id="fr_76"></span>[6](#fn_74.md) are subjects of legal questions of
offence. This is what is called a legal question arising out of offence.

'And among these, what is a legal question of business? Whatsoever is to
the Sa*m*gha a matter which ought to be done, an obligation, a matter
for which leave ought to be formally asked, the proposal

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

of a resolution <span id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_75.md), the proceeding by
is a *ñ*atti-dutiya-kamma <span id="fr_78"></span>[2](#fn_76.md), or by
*ñ*atti-*k*atuttha-kamma <span id="fr_79"></span>[2](#fn_76.md), that is
called a legal question of business.

3\. 'What is that which gives rise to a legal question of dispute? There
are six causes of dispute that give rise to legal questions of dispute.
And there are three causes of wrong-doing that give rise to legal
questions of dispute, and three causes of right-doing that give rise to
legal questions of dispute. And which are these six?

'In the first place, O Bhikkhus, there is the Bhikkhu who is angry, and
who bears enmity in his heart. Whatsoever Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, is such
an angry man bearing enmity in his heart, he remains without reverence
for, and without delight in the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Sa*m*gha,
and does not fulfil all the duties of a disciple. And whatsoever
Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, remains without reverence for, and without delight
in the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Sa*m*gha, and does not fulfil all
the duties of a disciple, he causes disputes to arise in the Sa*m*gha,
and such a dispute becomes a cause

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

of woe, and of want, and of disaster to the great multitudes, of woe and
of want to gods and men. If you, therefore, O Bhikkhus, perceive such a
one, a root of disputes both internal and external, do you exert
yourselves, O Bhikkhus, to put away from you so evil a person, the root
of those disputes. If you perceive, O Bhikkhus, no such person, take
pains lest any such evil root of disputes should thereafter arise among
you. Thus will so evil a root of disputes be put away from you, and thus
will no such evil person, the root of. disputes, arise hereafter among
you.

'Again, O Bhikkhus, there is the Bhikkhu, who is a hypocrite <span
id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_77.md), and who hides his faults; who is envious
and jealous; who is crafty and treacherous; who has sinful desires and
false beliefs; who is tarnished by love of worldly gain, devoted to
getting and taking, for whom to renounce a thing is hard. Whatsoever
Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, is thus a hypocrite, who hides his faults, he
remains \[&c., as before, the whole of the last paragraph down to the
end being repeated in each of the cases here enumerated\].

4\. 'And which are the three causes of wrong-doing which give rise to
legal questions of dispute?

'Herein, O Bhikkhus, men of greedy mind are given to dispute, men of
evil mind are given to dispute, men of foolish mind are given to
dispute, saying, "This is Dhamma," or "This is not Dhamma" \[&c., as
before, in § 2, down to\] or "This is not a

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

most grave offence." These are the three causes of wrong-doing which
give rise to legal questions of dispute.

'And which are the three causes of right-doing which give rise to legal
questions of dispute?

'In the first place, O Bhikkhus, men not of greedy mind \[&c., as in the
last paragraph, inserting the word "not"\].

5\. 'And what is that, O Bhikkhus, which gives rise to legal questions
of censure? There are six causes of censure that give rise to legal
questions of censure. And there are three causes of wrong-doing that
give rise to legal questions of censure. And there are three causes of
right-doing that give rise to legal questions of censure. And the body
gives rise to legal questions of censure, and speech gives rise to legal
questions of censure.'

\[The six are word for word the same as in the last section, reading
'censure' for 'dispute.'\]

'And which are the three causes of wrong-doing that give rise to legal
questions of censure?

'Herein, O Bhikkhus, men of greedy mind are given to censure, men of
evil mind are given to censure, men of foolish mind are given to
censure, accusing others of breaches of morality, or of behaviour, or of
error in doctrine, or of adopting a wrong means of livelihood. These are
the three causes of wrong-doing that give rise to legal questions of
censure.'

\[There follow the three causes of right-doing, reading 'men not of
greedy mind,' &c., as before, end of § 4.\]

And how does the body give rise to legal questions of censure? In case a
man be ill-favoured,

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

or ugly, or a dwarf <span id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_78.md), or diseased, or
blind of one eye, or lame, or humpbacked, or crippled, people find fault
with him on that account. This is how the body gives rise to legal
questions of censure.

'And how does speech give rise to legal questions of censure? In case a
man have a bad voice, or be indistinct, or harsh in speech <span
id="fr_82"></span>[2](#fn_79.md), then people find fault with him on that
account. This is how speech gives rise to legal questions of censure.

6\. 'And what is it that gives rise to legal questions of offence? There
are six origins of offence that give rise to legal questions of offence.
There is an offence that originates in deed, but not in word nor in
thought. There is an offence that originates in word, but not in deed
nor in thought. There is an offence that originates in deed and in word,
but not in thought. There is an offence that originates in deed and in
thought, but not in word. There is an offence that originates in word
and in thought, but not in deed. There is an offence that originates in
deed and in word and in thought. These are the six (&c.)

7\. 'And what is that which gives rise to legal questions of business?
There is one thing that gives rise to legal questions of business, that
is to say, the Sa*m*gha.

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

8\. 'Legal questions of dispute. Right. Wrong. Undetermined <span
id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_80.md).

'A legal question arising out of dispute may be right, and it may be
wrong, and it may be undetermined. Of these, which is the legal question
arising out of dispute which is right?

'In case, O Bhikkhus, the Bhikkhu of right mind discuss, saying, "This
is the Dhamma," or "This is not the Dhamma" (&c., as before, in § 2,
down to) or "This is not a most grave offence." Whatsoever quarrel,
strife, contention, difference of opinion, contradiction, opposition,
cantankerousness, or contention there may be in such a discussion is
called a legal question arising out of dispute that is right.'

\[And so when the Bhikkhus have a wrong mind, or an undetermined mind,
the legal question arising out of such dispute is respectively a legal
question arising out of dispute that is wrong or undetermined.\]

9\. 'Legal questions of censure. Right. Wrong. Undetermined.'

\[It may be either of the three, according as the Bhikkhus censuring (as
in § 5) have a right, wrong, or an undetermined mind. The form of the
paragraph corresponds to § 8 throughout.\]

10\. 'Legal questions of offence. Right. Wrong. Undetermined.

There may be a legal question whether an offence is wrong, and there may
be a legal question

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

whether an offence is undetermined. There is no legal question whether
an offence be right.

'Of these, which is a legal question whether an offence be wrong?
Whatsoever transgression be committed knowingly, consciously, and
deliberately, this is called a legal question whether an offence be
wrong.

'And of these, which is a legal question whether an offence be
undetermined? Whatsoever transgression be committed not knowingly, not
consciously, not deliberately, this is called a legal question whether
an offence be undetermined.

11\. 'Legal questions of business. Right. Wrong. Undetermined.'

\[It maybe all three, according as the Bhikkhus performing the business
specified, as in § 2, are right-minded, wrong-minded, or of undetermined
mind. The form of the paragraph as in § 8 throughout.\]

12\. 'Disputes, legal questions arising out of disputes. Dispute which
is no legal question. Legal question which is no dispute. Matter which
is both legal question and dispute.

'There may be a dispute which is a legal question of dispute. There may
be a dispute which is no legal question. There may be such a legal
question which is no dispute. There may be such a legal question and
also a dispute.

Of these, which is the dispute which is a legal question of dispute
requiring formal settlement? In case Bhikkhus discuss, saying, "This is
Dhamma" \[&c., as before, in § 2\], or "This is not a most grave
offence." Whatsoever quarrel, strife \[&c., as in § 2\] there may be on
such a matter is a dispute which is a legal question of dispute
requiring formal settlement.

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

'And of these, which is a dispute which is not a legal question
requiring formal settlement? When a mother disputes with her son, or a
son with his mother, or a father with his son, or a son with his father,
or a brother with a brother, or a brother with a sister, or a sister
with a brother, or a friend with a friend. Such a dispute is not a legal
question requiring formal settlement by the Sa*m*gha.

'And of these, which is a legal question that is not a dispute? A legal
question of censure, or a legal question of offence, or a legal question
of business. This is a legal question which is not a dispute.

'And of these, which is a legal question requiring formal settlement
which is also a dispute? A legal question of dispute that requires
formal settlement by the Sa*m*gha is both such a legal question and also
a dispute.'

13\. \[The same distinction drawn between censure, and a legal question
of censure requiring formal settlement.\]

14\. 'Offence. Legal question arising out of an offence. Offence which
is not subject of a legal question. Legal question and no offence. Legal
question and offence too.

'There may be an offence which is subject of a legal question of
offence. There may be an offence and no legal question. There may be
legal question and no offence. There may be legal question and offence
too.

Of these, which is the offence which may be subject of a legal question?
The five groups of offences are subjects of legal questions of offence;
the seven groups of offences are subjects of legal questions of offence.
These are offences which may be subject of a legal question.

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

And of these, which is an offence (Âpatti) which is not subject of a
legal question? Conversion, higher attainment (sot-âpatti, sam-âpatti),
these are âpattis which are not subjects of a legal question <span
id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_81.md). These are âpattis not subjects of a legal
question.

'And of these, what is the legal question where there is no offence? A
legal question of official duty, a legal question of censure, a legal
question of dispute. These are legal questions where there may be no
offence.

'And of these, which is the case in which there is both a legal question
and an offence too? A legal question regarding an offence is a case in
which there is both a legal question and an offence too.

15\. 'Official duty which is subject of a legal question of business.
Duty and no legal question. Legal question and no duty. Legal question
and duty too.

'There may be \[each of these four\].

'Of these, which is official duty which is subject of a legal question?
Whatsoever is to the Sa*m*gha a thing which ought to be done, an
obligation, a matter for which leave ought to be formally asked, the
proposal of a resolution, the proceeding by *ñ*atti-dutiya-kamma, or by
*ñ*atti-*k*atuttha-kamma, that is official duty which may be the subject
of a legal question of business.

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

'And of these, which is the official duty which is not subject of legal
question? The duties of an â*k*ariya, of an upa*ggh*âya, of a fellow
pupil under the same upa*ggh*âya or â*k*ariya, that is business, but not
subject of a legal question of business.

'And of these, which is a legal question but not official duty? A legal
question arising out of dispute, a legal question arising out of
censure, a legal question arising out of offence. This is a legal
question of business, but not official duty.

'And of these, which is both legal question and official duty too? A
legal question arising out of official business is both legal question
of business and official duty too <span id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_82.md).

16\. 'But by what kind of settlements is a legal question arising out of
dispute brought to settlement? By two kinds of settlement, by the
Proceeding in presence <span id="fr_86"></span>[2](#fn_83.md), and by the
Proceeding by majority of the Sa*m*gha <span
id="fr_87"></span>[3](#fn_84.md).

'If one should ask, "Can it be that a legal question arising out of
dispute without recourse having been had to the one mode of
settlement--to wit, the Proceeding by majority of the Sa*m*gha--can it
be that it may be settled by the other mode of settlement, to wit, by
the Proceeding in presence?" He should be told "Yes, it can." (If he
should say), "How may that be?" the answer should be as follows: "In

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

the case when the Bhikkhus dispute, saying, 'This is the Dhamma,' or
'This is not the Dhamma' (&c., as before, in § 2, down to), or 'This is
not a most grave offence.'" If, O Bhikkhus, those Bhikkhus, are able to
settle their own dispute, that is called, O Bhikkhus, the settlement of
the dispute.

' <span id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_85.md)And how has it been settled? By the
Proceeding in presence.

'And what must there be in such a Proceeding in presence? There must be
the presence of the Sa*m*gha, the presence of the Dhamma, the presence
of the Vinaya, and the presence of the particular person.

'And therein, what is the presence of the Sa*m*gha? As many Bhikkhus as
are capable of taking part in the proceeding <span
id="fr_89"></span>[2](#fn_86.md), they must be present. The formal consent
must be produced of those who are in a fit state to convey their
consent <span id="fr_90"></span>[3](#fn_87.md). Those who are present must
have lodged no objection (against any one of them taking part in the
proceeding) <span id="fr_91"></span>[4](#fn_88.md). This is the "presence"
in such a matter of the Sa*m*gha.

'And of these, what is the presence of the Dhamma, and the presence of
the Vinaya? The Dhamma, and the Vinaya, and the teaching of the Master
by the aid of which that legal question is settled. That is the
"presence" in such a matter of the Dhamma, and of the Vinaya.

'And of these, what is the presence of the particular

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

person? He who disputes, and he with whom he disputes--both friends and
foes--must be present. That is the "presence" in such a matter of the
particular person.

'When a legal question, O Bhikkhus, has beer. thus settled, if a
disputant re-open the question, such re-opening of the question is a
Pâ*k*ittiya <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_89.md). If one who has conveyed
his consent complain of the decision, such complaint is a
Pâ*k*ittiya <span id="fr_93"></span>[2](#fn_90.md).

17\. 'If those Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, are not able to settle the legal
question within their own residence (Âvâsa), those Bhikkhus should go, O
Bhikkhus, to some residence in which there are a larger number of
Bhikkhus. Then if those Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, should succeed, whilst on
their way to that residence, in settling the legal question, that, O
Bhikkhus, is called a settlement of it. And how has it been settled?
(&c., as in the last paragraph of the previous section, down to the
end.)

18\. 'If those Bhikkhus are not able, O Bhikkhus, to settle the legal
question whilst they are on their way to that residence, then those
Bhikkhus, on their arrival at that residence, are to address the
Bhikkhus at that residence thus: "Such and such a legal question, Sirs,
has arisen thus, and has been carried on thus amongst us. It would be
well if you, Sirs, would settle that legal question for us according to
the Dhamma, and according to the Vinaya, and according to the teaching
of the Master, to the end that that legal question may be thoroughly
settled." If the Bhikkhus dwelling in that residence

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

are the senior, and the incoming Bhikkhus are junior, then the Bhikkhus
dwelling in that residence are, O Bhikkhus, to address the incoming
Bhikkhus thus: "Pray, Sirs, rest a moment apart until we take counsel
together!" If, on the other hand, the Bhikkhus dwelling in that
residence are junior, and the incoming Bhikkhus are senior, then the
Bhikkhus dwelling in that residence are, O Bhikkhus, to address the
incoming Bhikkhus thus: "Then remain here, Sirs, a moment until we take
counsel together." Then if, O Bhikkhus, the Bhikkhus dwelling in that
residence should, on consideration, think thus: "We shall not be able to
settle this legal question according to the Dhamma, and according to the
Vinaya, and according to the teaching of the Master," then that dispute
is not to be entrusted to them. If, on the other hand, O Bhikkhus, the
Bhikkhus dwelling in that residence should, on consideration, think
thus: "We shall be able to settle this legal question in accordance with
the Dhamma, and in accordance with the Vinaya, and in accordance with
the teaching of the Master," then, O Bhikkhus, the Bhikkhus dwelling in
that residence are to address the incoming Bhikkhus thus: "If you, Sirs,
let us know about this legal question, how it arose, and how it was
carried on, and if you agree that in the manner in which we may settle
the legal question according to the Dhamma, and according to the Vinaya,
and according to the teaching of the Master, in that manner it shall be
settled, then we will thus accept the legal question at your hands. But
if not (&c., the whole being repeated), then we will not accept it."
When they have thus, O Bhikkhus, brought

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

it about that the proper way of putting the legal question (the point at
issue) has been settled, the Bhikkhus dwelling in that residence should
undertake that legal question. And then the Bhikkhus dwelling in that
residence should be addressed, O Bhikkhus, by the incoming Bhikkhus
thus: "We inform you, Sirs, how this legal question arose and how it was
carried on. If you, Sirs, are able in such and such a time <span
id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_91.md) to settle this legal question according to
the Dhamma, and according to the Vinaya, and according to the teaching
of the Master, then will we entrust this legal question to you. But if
you, Sirs, should not be able to do so, then will we ourselves retain
the custody of the case." Thus, O Bhikkhus, is that legal question to be
entrusted by the incoming Bhikkhus to the Bhikkhus dwelling in that
residence, causing them duly to accept it. If those Bhikkhus, O
Bhikkhus, are able to settle the case, that, O Bhikkhus, is called a
settlement of the legal question. And how has it been settled? (&c., as
in last paragraph of § 16, down to the end.)

19\. 'If, O Bhikkhus, whilst the case is being enquired into by those
Bhikkhus, pointless speeches are brought forth, and the sense of any
single utterance is not clear <span id="fr_95"></span>[2](#fn_92.md), I
enjoin upon you, O Bhikkhus, to settle the case by referring it (to a
jury or commission) <span id="fr_96"></span>[3](#fn_93.md).

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

'A Bhikkhu to be chosen on such a jury must be possessed of ten
qualities--he must be virtuous--he must be living enclosed by the
restraint of the rules of the Pâtimokkha--he must be upright in life,
trained according to the precepts, taking them upon himself with a sense
of the danger in the least offence <span
id="fr_97"></span>[1](#fn_94.md)--he must be versed in the tradition, a
custodian of the tradition, a storehouse of the tradition--whatsoever
truths, lovely in their origin, lovely in their progress, lovely in
their consummation, set forth the higher life, both in its spirit and in
its letter, in all its purity and in all its perfectness <span
id="fr_98"></span>[2](#fn_95.md), in such truths must he be well versed, of
such must he be full, they must be laid up in his words <span
id="fr_99"></span>[3](#fn_96.md), and dwelt on in his heart, being
penetrated throughout through right insight <span
id="fr_100"></span>[4](#fn_97.md)--both the Pâtimokkhas must have

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

been completely handed down to him in their full extent, he must have
well divided them, well established them, well investigated them, both
sutta by sutta and in every detail <span
id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_98.md)--further he must be an expert in the
Vinaya, irrefutable therein <span id="fr_102"></span>[2](#fn_99.md)--he
must be competent to point out (the right course) to both friends and
foes, to get them to understand a thing, get them to see it and
recognise it <span id="fr_103"></span>[3](#fn_100.md), able to pacify
them--he must be clever (in judging) both as to the origin and as to the
settlement of disputes--he must understand legal questions, the origin
thereof, the close thereof, and the way that leads to the close thereof.

'I enjoin upon you, O Bhikkhus, to appoint on the jury a Bhikkhu
possessed of these ten qualities <span id="fr_104"></span>[4](#fn_101.md).

20\. 'And thus, O Bhikkhus, is he to be appointed. First, the Bhikkhu
should be asked (whether he be willing to undertake the office). Then
some discreet and able Bhikkhu should address the Sa*m*gha thus:

'"May the venerable Sa*m*gha hear me. Whilst this case was being
enquired into pointless speeches were brought forth amongst us, and the
sense of no single utterance was clear. If the time seems meet

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

to the venerable Sa*m*gha, let it appoint Bhikkhus of such and such a
name, and of such and such a name on a committee. This is the motion.

'"Let the venerable Sa*m*gha hear me. Whilst (&c., . . . down to) no
single utterance was clear.

The Sa*m*gha appoints Bhikkhus of such and such names on a committee to
settle this case. Whosoever of the venerable ones approves of the
appointment of such and such Bhikkhus on the committee for the
settlement of this case, let him be silent. Whosoever approves not
thereof, let him speak.

'"Such and such a Bhikkhu is appointed by the Sa*m*gha on the committee
for the settlement of this case. Therefore is it silent. Thus do I
understand."

21\. 'If then, O Bhikkhus, those Bhikkhus are able on the reference (or
on the committee) to settle the case, that, O Bhikkhus, is called a case
that is settled. And how is it settled? By the Proceeding in
Presence <span id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_102.md). And what therein is
meant by the Proceeding in Presence? The Dhamma is represented, and the
Vinaya is represented, and the particular person is represented <span
id="fr_106"></span>[2](#fn_103.md).

'And of these, what is the presence of the Dhamma (&c., as in § 16, down
to the end).

'If a dispute, O Bhikkhus, has been thus settled, if a disputant re-open
the question, such re-opening is a Pâ*k*ittiya <span
id="fr_107"></span>[3](#fn_104.md).

22\. 'If, O Bhikkhus, whilst the case is being

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

enquired into by those Bhikkhus, there should be there a Bhikkhu who is
a preacher of the Dhamma, but neither has the Sutta <span
id="fr_108"></span>[1](#fn_105.md) been handed down to him nor the
Sutta-vibhaṅga, and he not regarding the point of the case, reject the
sense for the shadow of the letter, then should the matter be laid
before those Bhikkhus by some discreet and able Bhikkhu thus:

'"Let the venerable ones hear me. This Bhikkhu of such and such a name
is a preacher of the Dhamma, but neither has the Sutta been handed down
to him nor the Sutta-vibhaṅga. And he, not regarding the point of the
case, is rejecting the sense for the shadow of the letter. If the time
seems meet to the venerable ones, let them send away <span
id="fr_109"></span>[2](#fn_106.md) the Bhikkhu of such and such a name, and
let the rest of us settle this case."

'If those Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, should be able, after having sent away
that Bhikkhu, to settle the case, that is called a case that is settled.
And how has it been settled? By the Proceeding in Presence (&c., as in
last section, down to the end).'

23\. (The same decision if the Sutta has been handed down to him, but
not the Sutta-vibhaṅga.)

24\. 'If those Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, are not able by the committee to
settle that case, those Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, ought to hand over the
case to the Sa*m*gha, saying, "We, Sirs, are not able by a committee to
settle this case, let the Sa*m*gha settle it." I enjoin upon you, O
Bhikkhus, to settle such a case by vote of the majority (&c., as in
chapter 9 to the

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

end, as to the appointment of a taker of the voting tickets). By that
Bhikkhu, the taker of the voting tickets, are the votes to be collected.
And according as the larger number of Bhikkhus who are guided by the
Dhamma shall speak, so shall the case be decided. This, O Bhikkhus, is
called a legal question that has been settled.

'And how has it been settled? By the Proceeding in Presence and by the
vote of the majority. And what herein is meant by Proceeding in
Presence? The presence of the Sa*m*gha, and the presence of the Dhamma,
and the presence of the Vinaya, and the presence of the particular
person. And of these, what is the presence of the Sa*m*gha? (&c., as in
§ 16, down to) That is the presence in such a matter of the particular
person.

'And what herein is meant by the vote of the majority? The carrying out
of, the accomplishment of, the proceeding by, the undertaking of, the
acceptance of, the pacification by the official act (the Kamma) by the
vote of the majority <span id="fr_110"></span>[1](#fn_107.md). That is what
is meant herein by the vote of the majority.

'When a legal question, O Bhikkhus, has been thus settled, if a
disputant re-open the question, such re-opening is a Pâ*k*ittiya. If one
who has conveyed his consent complain of the decision, such complaint is
a Pâ*k*ittiya <span id="fr_111"></span>[2](#fn_108.md).'

25\. Now at that time a certain legal question had arisen in such and
such a manner, and had grown up in such and such a manner at Sâvatthi.
And those

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bhikkhus were
discontented with the settlement of the case by the Sa*m*gha at
Sâvatthi. And they heard that in a certain residence there were dwelling
a number of Theras versed in the traditions; men to whom the
Agamas <span id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_109.md) had been handed down;
reciters of the Dhamma, of the Vinaya, and of the Mâtikâs <span
id="fr_113"></span>[2](#fn_110.md), learned, discreet, wise, modest,
conscientious, anxious to learn. And they thought, 'If those Theras
would settle this case according to the Dhamma, and according to the
Vinaya, and according to the teaching of the Master, then would this
case be indeed well settled.' So those Bhikkhus went to that residence,
and spake to those Theras thus: 'This legal question, Sirs, has arisen
in such and such a manner, and has grown up in such and such a manner.
It would be well if the venerable Theras would settle the case according
to the Dhamma, and according to the Vinaya, and according to the
teaching of the Master!' Then those Theras, saying, 'Even as the case
has been settled by the Sa*m*gha at Sâvatthi, so is it well settled!'
decided the case in the same way. Then those Bhikkhus who had been
discontented with the decision of the Sa*m*gha at Sâvatthi were
discontented with the decision of the number of Theras.

\[The paragraph is repeated with the necessary alterations of
consecutive applications to three, two and one Thera with the same
result.\]

Then those Bhikkhus, discontented with the decision of the Sa*m*gha at
Sâvatthi, discontented with the decision of the number of Theras,
discontented

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

with the decision of the three Theras, discontented with the decision of
the two Theras, discontented with the decision of the single Thera, went
up to the place where the Blessed One was, and told the matter to the
Blessed One.

This case, O Bhikkhus, is done with; having been once settled, it is
settled for good.

26 <span id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_111.md). 'I enjoin upon you, O
Bhikkhus, three ways of taking votes, in order to appease such
Bhikkhus <span id="fr_115"></span>[2](#fn_112.md)--the secret method, the
whispering method, and the open method.

'And how, O Bhikkhus, is the secret method of taking votes? The Bhikkhu
who is the teller of the votes is to make the voting tickets of
different colours, and as each Bhikkhu comes up to him he is to say to
him thus: "This is the ticket for the man of such an opinion; this the
ticket for the man of such an opinion. Take whichever you like." When he
has chosen (he is to add), "Don't show it to anybody." If he ascertains
that those whose opinion is against the Dhamma are in the majority, he
is to reject the vote as wrongly taken. If he ascertains that those
whose opinion is in accordance with the Dhamma are in the majority, he
is to report the vote as well taken. This, O Bhikkhus, is the secret
method of taking the votes.

'And how, O Bhikkhus, is the whispering method of taking votes? The
Bhikkhu who is the teller of the votes is to whisper in each Bhikkhu's
ear, "This is the ticket of those of such an opinion; this is the ticket
of those of such an opinion. Take whichever

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

you like." When he has chosen (he is to add), "Don't tell anybody (which
way you have voted)." If he ascertains that those whose opinion is
against the Dhamma are in the majority, he is to reject the vote as
wrongly taken. If he ascertains that those whose opinion is in
accordance with the Dhamma are in the majority, he is to report the vote
as well taken. Thus, O Bhikkhus, is the whispering method of taking the
votes.

And how, O Bhikkhus, is the open method of taking votes? If he
ascertains (beforehand) that those whose opinion is in accordance with
the Dhamma are in the majority, the vote is to be taken undisguisedly,
openly. Thus, O Bhikkhus, is the open method of taking the votes.

'These, O Bhikkhus, are the three methods of taking the votes <span
id="fr_116"></span>[1](#fn_113.md).'

27\. 'By how many kinds of settlement is a legal question arising out of
censure settled? A legal question arising out of censure can be settled
by four kinds of settlement--by the Proceeding in Presence--by the
Proceeding for those who are consciously innocent-by the Proceeding for
those who are no longer out of their mind--by the Proceeding for those
who are obstinate.

'If one should ask, "Can it be that a legal question arising out of
censure, without recourse being had to two modes of settlement--to wit,
the Proceeding for those who are no longer out of their mind, and the

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Proceeding for
those who are obstinate--may be settled by the two other modes of
settlement--to wit, the Proceeding in Presence, and the Proceeding for
those who are consciously innocent?" he should be told, "Yes, it can."
(If he should say), "How may that be?" the answer should be as follows:

'In case the Bhikkhus bring a groundless charge against a Bhikkhu of a
breach of morality. In respect thereof, O Bhikkhus, to that Bhikkhu
whose memory in regard to the matter is quite clear, the Proceeding for
the consciously innocent is to be accorded.

'And thus, O Bhikkhus, is to be granted (&c., as in chapter 4, § 10,
down to the end, with the necessary alterations for a general rule
instead of a particular case).

'This, O Bhikkhus, is called a legal question that has been settled. And
how settled? By the Proceeding in Presence, and by the Proceeding for
the consciously innocent. And what therein belongs to the Proceeding in
Presence? The presence of the Sa*m*gha, and the presence of the Dhamma,
and the presence of the Vinaya, and the presence of the particular
person. And therein what is the presence of the Sa*m*gha (&c., as in §
16, down to the end)? And what therein belongs to the Proceeding for the
consciously innocent? The carrying out of, the accomplishment of; the
proceeding by, the undertaking of, the acceptance of, the pacification
of the Proceeding for the consciously innocent <span
id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_114.md). That is what belongs herein to the
Proceeding for the consciously innocent.'

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

28\. \[This section bears exactly the same relation to chapter 5 as the
last section does to chapter 4, the form of the two sections being
exactly the same throughout.\]

29 <span id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_115.md). 'If one should ask, "Can it be
that a legal question arising out of censure, without recourse being had
to two modes of settlement--to wit, the Proceeding for those who are
consciously innocent, and the Proceeding for those who are no longer out
of their mind--may be settled by the two other modes of settlement--to
wit, the Proceeding in Presence, and the Proceeding for those who are
obstinate?" he should be told, "Yes, it can." If he should say, "How may
that be?" the answer should be as follows:

'In case a Bhikkhu warn another Bhikkhu in the midst of the Sa*m*gha of
a grievous offence, and call upon him to recollect (whether he have.
committed it or not), saying, "Has the venerable one been guilty of such
and such a grievous offence--a Pârâ*g*ika offence, or an offence
equivalent to a Pârâ*g*ika offence?" And he replies thus, "I do not,
Sir, call to mind that I have been guilty of such and such a grievous
offence--a Pârâ*g*ika offence, or an offence equivalent to a Pârâ*g*ika
offence." To him thus denying the other insists, saying, "Come now, Sir,
ascertain for certain whether you are conscious of having been guilty of
such and such a grievous

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

offence--a Pârâ*g*ika offence, or an offence equivalent to a Pârâ*g*ika
offence." And he replies thus: "I do not, Sir, call to mind that I have
been guilty of such and such a grievous offence--a Pârâ*g*ika offence,
or an offence equivalent to a Pârâ*g*ika offence. But I do, Sir,
recollect that I was guilty of such and such a trifling offence." To him
thus denying the other insists \[as before\]. And he replies thus:
"Seeing that I am willing, Sir, though you did not ask me, to confess
myself guilty of that trifling offence, why should I not confess, when
asked, such and such a grievous offence--a Pârâ*g*ika offence, or an
offence equivalent to a Pârâ*g*ika offence?" And the other rejoins, "But
you do not confess, Sir, even that trifling offence without being asked.
How should you confess, if you were not asked, the commission of such
and such a grievous offence--a Pârâ*g*ika offence, or one equivalent to
a Pârâ*g*ika offence? Come now, Sir, ascertain for certain whether you
are conscious of having been guilty of such and such a grievous
offence--a Pârâ*g*ika offence, or one equivalent to .a. Pârâ*g*ika
offence?" And he replies, "Yes, I am conscious, Sir, of having committed
such and such an offence--a Pârâ*g*ika offence, or one equivalent to a
Pârâ*g*ika offence. In sport did I say, in fun did I say that I was not
conscious thereof"

'Then, O Bhikkhus, the Proceeding for those who are obstinate should be
carried out against that Bhikkhu.

'And thus should it be carried out (&c., as chapter 11, § 2, down to the
end, reading "such and such a Bhikkhu" for "Upavâla," and "grievous
offence" for "offence ").

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

'This, O Bhikkhus, is called a legal question that has been settled. And
how has it been settled? By the Proceeding in Presence, and by the
Proceeding for those who are obstinate. And what therein belongs to the
Proceeding in Presence? The Presence of the Sa*m*gha (&c., as in § 16).
And what therein belongs to the Proceeding for those who are obstinate?
The carrying out of, the accomplishment of, the proceeding by, the
undertaking of, the acceptance of, the pacification of the official act
(the Kamma) by the Proceeding for those who are obstinate. That is what
belongs therein to the Proceeding for those who are obstinate.

'When a legal question, O Bhikkhus, has been thus settled, if a
disputant re-open the question, such re-opening is a Pâ*k*ittiya. If one
who has conveyed his consent complain of the decision, such complaint is
a Pâ*k*ittiya.

30\. 'By how many modes of settlement is a legal question arising out of
offence settled? A legal question arising out of offence is settled by
three modes of settlement--to wit, by the Proceeding in Presence, and by
the Proceeding on confession of guilt, and by the Proceeding by covering
over as with grass.

'If one should ask, "Can it be that a legal question arising out of
offence, without recourse being had to the one mode of settlement--to
wit, the Proceeding by covering over as with grass--may be settled by
the other two modes--to wit, the Proceeding in Presence, and the
Proceeding on confession of guilt?" he should be told, "Yes, it can." If
he should say, "How may that be?" the answer should be as follows:

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

'In case a Bhikkhu has been guilty of a minor offence. That Bhikkhu, O
Bhikkhus, should go up to another Bhikkhu, and having arranged his upper
robe over one shoulder, and squatted down on his heels, and stretched
forth his hands with the palms held together, should speak as follows:
"I, Sir, have been guilty of such and such an offence; and that I
confess." He should say, "Do you acknowledge it?" "Yes; I acknowledge
it." "May you restrain yourself in future <span
id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_116.md)!"

'This, O Bhikkhus, is called a legal question which has been settled.
And how has it been settled? By the Proceeding in Presence, and by the
Proceeding on confession of guilt. And what therein belongs to the
Proceeding in Presence? The presence of the Dhamma, and the presence of
the Vinaya, and the presence of the particular individual. And what
therein is the presence of the Dhamma, and of the Vinaya? The Dhamma,
and the Vinaya, and the teaching of the Master, by the aid of which that
legal question is settled. That is the presence in such a matter of the
Dhamma, and of the Vinaya. And what therein is the presence of the
particular individual? He who confesses, and he to whom he confesses,
both are present. That is the presence of the particular individual in
such a proceeding. And what therein belongs to the Proceeding on
confession of guilt? The carrying out of, the accomplishment of, the
proceeding by, the performance of, the acceptance of, the pacification
of the official act (the Kamma) by the Proceeding on confession of

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

guilt. That is what belongs therein to the Proceeding on confession of
guilt.

'When a legal question, O Bhikkhus, has been thus settled, if a
disputant re-open the question, such re-opening is a Pâ*k*ittiya <span
id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_117.md).

31\. 'If he should thus receive (absolution), it is well. If he should
not receive it, that Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, should go up to a number of
Bhikkhus, and having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and
bowed down before the elder Bhikkhus, and squatted down on his heels,
and stretched forth his two hands with the palms held together, he
should speak as follows: "I, Sirs, have been guilty of such and such an
offence, and that I confess." Then some discreet and able Bhikkhu should
lay the matter before those Bhikkhus, saying, "Let the venerable ones
hear me. This Bhikkhu, of such and such a name, is conscious of an
offence; and he discloses it, reveals it, confesses it. If the time
seems meet to the venerable ones, I would absolve <span
id="fr_121"></span>[2](#fn_118.md) that Bhikkhu's offence." And he should
say, "Do you acknowledge it?" "Yes; I acknowledge it." "In future may
you restrain yourself!"

This, O Bhikkhus, is called a legal question which has been settled. And
how has it been settled? (&c., as in last section, down to the end.)

32\. 'If he should thus receive absolution, it is well. If he should not
receive it, that Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, should go before the Sa*m*gha
(&c., as in last section, down to the end, then adding): And if one who
has given his consent to the proceeding

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

thereafter make complaint thereof, that is a Pâ*k*ittiya.

33\. 'If one should ask, "Can it be that a legal question arising out of
offence, without recourse being had to the one mode of settlement--to
wit, the Proceeding on confession of guilt--may be settled by the other
two modes--to wit, by the Proceeding in Presence, and by the Proceeding
by covering over as with grass?" he should be told, "Yes, it can." If he
should say, "How may that be?" the answer should be as follows:

'If while the Bhikkhus are continuing in quarrels (&c., as in chapter
13, §§ 1, 2, and 3, down to the end).

'This, O Bhikkhus, is called a legal question that has been settled. And
how has it been settled? By the Proceeding in Presence, and by the
Proceeding by the covering over as with grass.

'And what therein belongs to the Proceeding in Presence? The presence
(&c., as in § 16, down to) And what therein is the presence of the
particular person? He who confesses, and he to whom the confession is
made <span id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_119.md), both are present. This is
the presence of the particular individual in such a case.

'And what therein belongs to the Proceeding by covering over as with
grass? The carrying out of, the accomplishment of, the proceeding by,
the performance of, the acceptance of, the pacification of the official
act (the Kamma) by the Proceeding by covering over as with grass. That
is what belongs therein to the Proceeding by covering over as with
grass.

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

'When a legal question, O Bhikkhus, has been thus settled, if a
disputant re-open the question, such re-opening is a Pâ*k*ittiya. If one
who has conveyed his consent complain of the decision, such complaint is
a Pâ*k*ittiya.

34\. 'By how many modes of settlement is a legal question arising out of
business settled? A legal question arising out of business is settled by
one mode of settlement only--to wit, by the Proceeding in Presence.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_65"></span>[34:2](sbe20015.htm#fr_66.md) It was with reference
to this conduct of *Kh*anna that the Buddha is stated in the
Mahâ-parinibbâna Sutta VI, 4 to have imposed a penalty upon him. He is
also mentioned above, I, 25-31, and below, XI, 1, 12-14.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[34:3](sbe20015.htm#fr_67.md) Compare the 16th and
43rd Pâ*k*ittiyas. Buddhaghosa says here, Bhikkhunîna*m* anupakha*gg*â
ti bhikkhunîna*m* antopavisitvâ.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[35:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_68.md) The various ways of
settling these four kinds of legal questions are recapitulated in §
27-34 of this chapter.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[35:2](sbe20015.htm#fr_69.md)
Sâvasesâ-anavasesâ-âpatti. The Parivara IX, 1, 10 says, Yâ sâ âpatti
anavasesâ sâ âpatti na katamena adhikara*n*ena na katamamhi *th*âne na
katamena samathena sammati. It is practically equivalent therefore to
Pârâ*g*ikâ. Those offences which can be done away, but only by the
Sa*m*gha, are called accordingly in the Buddhist Sanskrit
Sa*m*ghâva*s*esha, which corresponds to the Pâli Sa*m*ghâdisesa. The
translation and note at Mahâvagga X, 2, 4 should be altered accordingly.

Pârâ*g*ika, Sa*m*ghâdisesa, Pâ*k*ittiya, Pâ*t*idesaniya, and Dukka*t*a,
as below, in IV, 14, 14; IX, 3, 3.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[36:6](sbe20015.htm#fr_76.md) That is to say, the
five mentioned in the last note, and besides them, Thulla*kk*aya and
Dubbhâsita.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[37:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_77.md) Apalokana-kamman

<span id="fn_76"></span>[37:2](sbe20015.htm#fr_79.md) See our note at
Mahâvagga I, 28, 3. The Samanta Pâsâdikâ here says,
*ñ*attidutiyakamma*m* pana apaloketvâ kattabba*m* pi atthi akattabba*m*
pi atthi. Tattha sîmasammuti simasamûhananâ kathinadâna*m* kathinubbhâro

apaloketvâ pi kâtu*m* va*tt*anti.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[38:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_80.md) Palâsî; no doubt
connected with the primary meaning of the word 'leaf,' as is also its
use in the sense of 'covering, lining,' in eka-palâsikâ upâhanâ at
Mahâvagga V, 1, 29. The expression forms the subject of Puggala II, 2.
See also *G*âtaka III, 259.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[40:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_81.md) Buddhaghosa has no
explanation of these terms here, but on Aṅguttara Nikâya III, 2, 3,
where the whole list recurs, he says (as Dr. Morris is good enough to
inform us) that oko*t*imako is equal to laku*nt*ako; and the same
explanation is given by the commentary on Puggala IV, 19. Compare the
use in English of 'a mere dot of a man,' in a similar sense.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[40:2](sbe20015.htm#fr_82.md) These three epithets
of the voice are no doubt intended to be the opposites of the three in
Mahâvagga V, 13.'9.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[41:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_83.md) We have already
pointed out (above, IV, 1, 2) that this mode of the commencement of a
discussion by setting out a list of the points to be discussed and
compared is found also in some of the Abhidhamma books. There it was
only the objects themselves, here we have all the predicates which it is
proposed to apply (as in § 8), or to declare inapplicable to the object
(as in § 10), which are set out, but the principle is the same.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[44:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_84.md) This is merely a play
upon words. Âpatti is literally 'attainment to.' Standing alone it is
always used with the connotation of 'attainment to guilt, sin, offence,'
so that its etymological meaning is always lost sight of. Sotâpatti is
the 'attainment to,' the 'entering upon' the stream, that is, the course
of the Excellent Way. The Sam âpatti s, literally, 'complete, or higher,
attainments,' are eight successive states of ecstatic insight or
meditation practised by Arahats and other men of advanced spiritual
culture. The question stated is in fact a riddle, like so many of the
questions stated in the Parivâra and the Puggala-pa*ññ*atti.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[45:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_85.md) Here again the whole
section depends upon a play upon the various meanings of the word
ki*kk*am. In the technical phrase ki*kk*âdhikarana*m*, the word means
solely the business or the agenda at the formal meetings of the Sa*m*gha
(compare above, § 7). In the problems or riddles of this section its
more common meaning of 'duty' is brought into play.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[45:2](sbe20015.htm#fr_86.md) Sammukhâ-vinayena.
See above, chapter 2.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[45:3](sbe20015.htm#fr_87.md) Yebhuyyasikena. See
above, chapter 9.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[46:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_88.md) The following five
paragraphs recur in IV, 14, §§ 24, 27, and four of them in IV, 14, 21,
30.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[46:4](sbe20015.htm#fr_91.md) Or rather, 'perhaps,
'against the proceedings which are being carried out.'

<span id="fn_89"></span>[47:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_92.md) This is the 63rd
Pâ*k*ittiya.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[47:2](sbe20015.htm#fr_93.md) This is the 79th
Pâ*k*ittiya. The whole paragraph is repeated several times below in this

XII, 2, 7, where an instance occurs of the mode of proceeding here laid
down.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[49:3](sbe20015.htm#fr_96.md) Ubbâhikâya. Childers
has quite misunderstood both the meaning and the derivation of this
term. It must be derived <span id="page_50">p. 50</span> from ud+vah;
and means simply 'reference'--the turning over of a difficult or
intricate case from the general Sa*m*gha to a special committee, as was
done at Vesâlî (below, XII, 2, 7).

<span id="fn_94"></span>[50:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_97.md) With this passage (so
far) compare the Âkaṅkheyya Sutta, § 2 (translated in Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist
Suttas,' p. 210), where the wording is somewhat different. See, however,
the various readings here.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[50:2](sbe20015.htm#fr_98.md) We prefer to
translate, in accordance with IX, 5, I below, sâttha*m* savya*ñg*ana*m*
as given in the corrections to the text on p. 303; thus making the
phrase 'in the spirit and in the letter' refer to the
brahma-*k*ariya*m*, and not to the dhammâ. But it should be pointed out
that the parallel passage in the stock description of a Buddha (for
instance in Tevi*gg*a Sutta I, 46, translated in Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist
Suttas,' p. 187) would support the reading given here in the text,
referring the phrase in question to the dhammâ, and not to the
brahma-*k*ariya*m*.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[50:3](sbe20015.htm#fr_99.md) See the various
readings, and compare Sigâlovâda Sutta, p. 301; *G*âtaka II, 247, 293;
Mahâvagga VI, 25, I.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[50:4](sbe20015.htm#fr_100.md) Though di*tth*i is
usually found in its bad sense of 'delusion' (it never means 'heresy,'
as Childers renders it), it is also used, especially in older texts, in
the good sense of 'insight.' Compare the 'Book of the Great Decease,' I,
11.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[51:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_101.md) Perhaps this may
mean 'both as to the Suttas themselves and as to the Old Commentary upon
them'--suttato anuvya*ñg*anaso. See 'Vinaya Texts,' vol. i, p. xviii,
and note 2, p. xxix.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[51:2](sbe20015.htm#fr_102.md) Vinaye *kh*eko hoti
asa*m*hîro. Compare on the use of these words, *G*âtaka I, 290; II, 161;
Sutta Nipâta V, 18, 26.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[51:3](sbe20015.htm#fr_103.md) On all these terms,
which have occurred above at IV, 2, I, see the commentary as there
quoted in the notes.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[51:4](sbe20015.htm#fr_104.md) It is of course to
be understood that the committee or jury does not consist of only one
such Bhikkhu. In the instance already referred to as occurring in XII,
2, 7, four are chosen from each side.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[52:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_105.md) Sammukhâ-vinayena.
See chapter 2.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[52:2](sbe20015.htm#fr_106.md) This is the same as
in § 16 of this chapter, except that 'the presence of the Sa*m*gha' is
omitted.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[52:3](sbe20015.htm#fr_107.md) See the 63rd
Pâ*k*ittiya, and § 17 above.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[53:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_108.md) That is, the
Pâtimokkha.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[53:2](sbe20015.htm#fr_109.md) Literally, 'cause
him to arise.'

<span id="fn_107"></span>[54:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_110.md) This sentence is
also used of the other modes of settlement below, §§ 27, 29.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[54:2](sbe20015.htm#fr_111.md) So also above, §
16; and below, §§ 27-29.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[55:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_112.md) That is, the Four
Nikâyas, now forming the Sutta Pi*t*aka.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[55:2](sbe20015.htm#fr_113.md) See our note above
on *K*ullavagga IV, 1, 2.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[56:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_114.md) On the following
section, compare chapters 9 and to above.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[56:2](sbe20015.htm#fr_115.md) On Sa*ññ*attiyâ see
our note below on VII, 4, I.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[57:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_116.md) This naive chapter
would seem to show that the pia fraus was not unknown to the Buddhist
monks at the time when the *K*ullavagga was composed. Buddhaghosa's note
(given at p. 315 of H.O.'s edition of the text) specifies the different
occasions when each of the three methods should be used.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[58:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_117.md) This clause
corresponds to the one above, in §24, and below, in § 29.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[59:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_118.md) This section again
bears exactly the same relation to chapter 11 as the previous ones have
done to chapters 4 and 5 respectively. The outline of the form is the
same, but as in the introductory part (containing the description of the
offence) the present section is much fuller than the chapter to which it
refers, 'we prefer to give that part of this section in full.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[62:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_119.md) Âyati*m*
samvareyyâsi. So again in the next section. Compare V, 20, 5.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[63:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_120.md) See §§ 16, 29, &c.
of this chapter.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[63:2](sbe20015.htm#fr_121.md)
Pa*t*iga*n*heyya*m*. See V, 20, 5.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[64:1](sbe20015.htm#fr_122.md) This refers to the
technical term of the Proceeding in question, ti*n*avatthârakena
deseyya*m* (IV, 13, 2); and the singular of course includes the plural,
as the confession usually took place before a number of Bhikkhus.
