### 20.

1\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus walked over the mats used for sleeping
upon with unwashen or wet feet, or with their sandals on; and the
matting was soiled.

They told these matters to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to do so. Whosoever does, shall be guilty of a
dukka*t*a <span id="fr_624"></span>[4](#fn_614).'

2\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus spat on the newly prepared floor <span
id="fr_625"></span>[5](#fn_615), and the colour was spoilt.

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to do so. Whosoever does, shall be guilty of a
dukka*t*a. I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a spittoon.'

Now at that time the legs of the bedsteads and chairs made scratches on
the newly prepared floor. They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to cover it up with floor-cloth.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus leant up against the newly prepared
walls <span id="fr_626"></span>[1](#fn_616), and the colouring was
spoilt.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to do so. Whosoever does, shall be guilty of a
dukka*t*a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a board to lean up
against <span id="fr_627"></span>[2](#fn_617).'

The board scratched the floor at the bottom, and ruined the wall at the
top.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to cover it at the top and bottom with cloth.'

Now at that time, fearing to offend, they would not lie down on places
over which it was permissible to walk with washen feet <span
id="fr_628"></span>[3](#fn_618).

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to lie down in such a place when you have
spread something over it.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_614"></span>[218:4](sbe20072.htm#fr_624) With this should
be compared the other rule in Mahâvagga V, 6, 1, according to which the
Bhikkhus were to wear sandals when getting upon bedsteads or chairs,
lest these should become soiled. The two passages are parallel in
wording throughout.

<span id="fn_615"></span>[218:5](sbe20072.htm#fr_625) Parikammakatâya.
The floors were of earth, not of wood, and were restored from time to
time by fresh clay or dry cowdung being laid down, and then covered with
a whitewash, in which sometimes black or red (geruka) was mixed. See
above, V, 11, 6; VI, 3, 1; 17, 1; 27. From the parallel passage at
Mahâvagga I, 25, 15, and *K*ullavagga VIII, 3, 1, it would seem that the
red colouring was used rather for walls, and the black one for floors.

<span id="fn_616"></span>[219:1](sbe20072.htm#fr_626) 'The walls were no
doubt usually made with 'wattle and daub;' that is, sticks with clay
between the interstices. This was treated from time to time like the
flooring (see last note).

<span id="fn_617"></span>[219:2](sbe20072.htm#fr_627)
Apassena-phalaka*m*. This article of furniture is mentioned, with the
spittoon, in Mahâvagga I, 45, 15, 16, and in the parallel passage at
*K*ullavagga VIII, 1, 3. We have rendered it in the Mahâvagga by 'board
to recline on.' Compare the use of apassaya*m* in Buddhaghosa's note on
*K*ullavagga VI, 2, 4 (above, [p. 153](sbe20048.htm#page_153), note 3)
of an arm-chair or sofa.

<span id="fn_618"></span>[219:3](sbe20072.htm#fr_628) Dhotapâdakâ ti
dhotapâdakâ hutvâ dhotehi pâdehi akkamitabba*th*âne nipa*gg*itu*m*
kukku*kk*âyanti. Dhotapâdake ti pi pâ*th*o. Dhotehi pâdehi
akkamitabba*tth*ânass’ eva eta*m* adhiva*k*ana*m* (B.).
