### 29.

1\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu entered the village for alms
without a girdle on, and in the highway <span
id="fr_378"></span>[1](#fn_371.md) his waist-cloth fell down <span
id="fr_379"></span>[2](#fn_372.md). The people made an outcry, and that
Bhikkhu was abashed.

On his return to the Ârâma, that Bhikkhu told this matter to the
Bhikkhus, and the Bhikkhus told it to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to enter the village without a girdle on.
Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I allow, O Bhikkhus,
a girdle <span id="fr_380"></span>[3](#fn_373.md).'

2\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus wore (&c., as usual,
ending with)

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to wear special girdles <span
id="fr_381"></span>[4](#fn_374.md)--those made of many strings plaited

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

together <span id="fr_382"></span>[1](#fn_375.md), those made like the head
of a water-snake <span id="fr_383"></span>[2](#fn_376.md), girdles with
tambourines on them <span id="fr_384"></span>[3](#fn_377.md), girdles with
beads on (or with ornaments hanging from them) <span
id="fr_385"></span>[4](#fn_378.md). Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a
dukka*t*a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, girdles of two kinds--those made of
strips of cloth, and those . . . . <span
id="fr_386"></span>[5](#fn_379.md)'

The borders of the girdles decayed through age.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, an edging of brighter material <span
id="fr_387"></span>[6](#fn_380.md) and strengthening at the ends <span
id="fr_388"></span>[7](#fn_381.md).'

The end of the girdle where the knot was tied decayed through age <span
id="fr_389"></span>[8](#fn_382.md).

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a buckle <span id="fr_390"></span>[9](#fn_383.md).'

\[A paragraph on the substances of which it may be made, as usual, see
Mahâvagga VI, 12, 3; *K*ullavagga V, 5, 2, &c.,

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

adding at the end 'and made of string.'\]

3\. Now at the time the venerable Ânanda went into the village for alms
with light garments on <span id="fr_391"></span>[1](#fn_384.md) and his
garments were blown up by a whirlwind.

The venerable Ânanda, on returning to the Ârâma, told this matter to the
Bhikkhus; and the Bhikkhus told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a block <span id="fr_392"></span>[2](#fn_385.md) (to
be used as a weight) or a chain <span id="fr_393"></span>[3](#fn_386.md).'

\[Similar paragraph to that just above as to the substances of which the
block may be made.\]

Now at that time the Bhikkhus fastened the block or the chain
immediately on to their robes; and the robes gave way.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a piece of phalaka cloth <span
id="fr_394"></span>[4](#fn_387.md)to attach the block or the chain to.'

They fastened the phalaka cloth for the block or the chain on to the
edge of the robe; and the corner came open <span
id="fr_395"></span>[5](#fn_388.md).

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to fasten the phalaka cloth for the block on
the edge of the robe, and to fasten the phalaka cloth for the chain
seven or eight finger-breadths up the robe.'

4\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus wore (&c., as usual,
ending with)

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to wear your under garments arranged as laymen
do, nor arranged with appendages like elephant-trunks <span
id="fr_396"></span>[1](#fn_389.md), nor arranged like fishing-nets <span
id="fr_397"></span>[2](#fn_390.md), nor arranged with four corners
showing <span id="fr_398"></span>[3](#fn_391.md), nor arranged like
flower-stands <span id="fr_399"></span>[4](#fn_392.md), nor arranged like
rows of jewelry <span id="fr_400"></span>[5](#fn_393.md). Whosoever does
so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.

\[Similar paragraph, ending\]

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to wear your upper <span
id="fr_401"></span>[6](#fn_394.md)

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

garments as the laymen do. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a
dukka*t*a.'

5\. \[Similar paragraph, ending\]

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to wear your under garments <span
id="fr_402"></span>[1](#fn_395.md) as the king's porters do <span
id="fr_403"></span>[1](#fn_395.md). Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a
dukka*t*a.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_371"></span>[142:1](sbe20044.htm#fr_378.md) Rathiyâya. The Old
Commentary on the Bhikkhunî., vibhaṅga, Pâ*k*ittiya XIV, says, Rathiyâ
ti ra*kkh*â. The word recurs, ibid., Pâ*k*ittiya LXXXVI, XCVI (the last
of which is nearly the same as our passage here). For the more usual
form rathikâ, see *K*ullavagga X, 12.

<span id="fn_372"></span>[142:2](sbe20044.htm#fr_379.md) Pabhassittha.
Compare Sutta-vibhaṅga, Pâ*k*ittiya LXXXIII, 1, 2. It is from the root
bhrams, not bhâs.

<span id="fn_373"></span>[142:3](sbe20044.htm#fr_380.md) The use of this
has already been enjoined at Mahâvagga I, 25, 9, 10. It was to be tied
on round the waist, over the waist-cloth, to keep it in its place.

<span id="fn_374"></span>[142:4](sbe20044.htm#fr_381.md) It is curious that
ka*t*i-suttaka*m*, a kind of girdle which would seem properly to belong
here, has been included in a former list of forbidden articles at V, 2,
I.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[143:1](sbe20044.htm#fr_382.md) Kalâbuka*m*. See
Buddhaghosa's note at p. 3'9 of the text, and compare Böhtlingk-Roth
under kalâpa, kalâpaka.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[143:2](sbe20044.htm#fr_383.md) De*dd*ubhaka*m*
nâma udaka-sappi-sîsa-sadisa*m* (B.). De*dd*ubha corresponds to the
later Sanskrit du*nd*ubha, an older form of which is dundubha.

<span id="fn_377"></span>[143:3](sbe20044.htm#fr_384.md) Mura*g*a,
literally, 'tambourines;' but see Buddhaghosa's note, loc. cit.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[143:4](sbe20044.htm#fr_385.md) Maddavîna*m* nâma
pâmaṅga-sa*nth*âna*m* (B.). On pâmaṅga, see our note at *K*ullavagga V,
2, I.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[143:5](sbe20044.htm#fr_386.md) Sûkarantaka*m*.
See Buddhaghosa's note at p. 319 of the text. We do not venture to
translate the term.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[143:6](sbe20044.htm#fr_387.md) Sobha*n*am nâma
ve*tth*etvâ mukha-va*tt*i-sibhana*m* (B.). In the Ma*ggh*ima Sîla, § 3,
sobha*n*akam or sobh.ana-kara*n*am (so Rh. D.'s MS.) is a kind of game
or show.

<span id="fn_381"></span>[143:7](sbe20044.htm#fr_388.md) Gu*n*aka*m* nâma
mudika(?muddhika)-san*th*ânena sibbana*m* (B.). Clough, under gu*n*a,
gives inter alia, 1. fastening; 2. a plant of the fibres of which
bow-strings are made; 3. bow-string.

<span id="fn_382"></span>[143:8](sbe20044.htm#fr_389.md) Pavananto ti
pâsanto (B.).

<span id="fn_383"></span>[143:9](sbe20044.htm#fr_390.md) Vidho. But both
the reading and the explanation are uncertain, and Buddhaghosa says
nothing. The word occurs also, and apparently in the same sense, in the
Old Commentary on the 86th Pâ*k*ittiya.

<span id="fn_384"></span>[144:1](sbe20044.htm#fr_391.md) Sa*m*ghâ*t*iyo in
the plural must mean garments and not waist-cloths only. See the
parallel passage in the Bhikkhunî-vibhaṅga, Pâ*k*ittiya XCVI.

<span id="fn_385"></span>[144:2](sbe20044.htm#fr_392.md) Ga*nth*ika*m*. The
use of this article is referred to in VIII, 4, 3, and at Dhammapada, p.
372. That ga*nth*i means a block, usually of mood, is clear from the use
of dhamma-ga*nth*ika*m* at *G*âtaka I, 150 (spelt ga*nd*ika however at
II, 124), compared with ga*nth*i (block of sandal-wood) above, V, 8, I.
The word occurs also in the Old Commentary on the 86th Pâ*k*ittiya.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[144:3](sbe20044.htm#fr_393.md) Pâsaka*m*, which
does not correspond to Sanskrit prâsaka here, but to pâ*s*aka = pâ*s*a
(Böhtlingk-Roth. give inter alia, 'Sahl oder Leiste am Anfange eines
Gewebes'). Compare pâsanta in Buddhaghosa on ma*kkh*avâ*l*aka*m* in the
next section.

<span id="fn_387"></span>[144:4](sbe20044.htm#fr_394.md) See our note on
this word at Mahâvagga VIII, 28, 2.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[144:5](sbe20044.htm#fr_395.md) That is, perhaps,
the weight dragged the robe to one side and the legs were visible
through the opening.

<span id="fn_389"></span>[145:1](sbe20044.htm#fr_396.md)
Hatthi-so*nd*aka*m* nâma nâbhi-mûlato hatthi-so*nd*a-san*th*âna*m*
olambaka*m* katvâ nivattha*m*, ko*li*ka-itthîna*m* nivâsana*m* viya
(B.).

<span id="fn_390"></span>[145:2](sbe20044.htm#fr_397.md)
Ma*kkh*a-vâ*l*aka*m* nâma ekato dasanta*m* ekato pâsantam olambitvâ
nivattha*m* (B.).

<span id="fn_391"></span>[145:3](sbe20044.htm#fr_398.md)
*K*atu-ka*nn*aka*m* upari dve he*tth*ato dve eva*m* *k*attâro ka*nn*e
dassetvâ nivattha*m* (B.).

<span id="fn_392"></span>[145:4](sbe20044.htm#fr_399.md) Tâla-va*nt*aka*m*
nâma tâlava*nt*’-âkârena sâ*t*aka*m* olambitvâ nivâsana*m* (B.). See our
note on tâlava*nt*a above, V, 22, 2, and on
âma*l*aka-va*nt*ika-pî*th*a*m* below, VI, 2, 4.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[145:5](sbe20044.htm#fr_400.md) Sata-vallika*m*
nâma dîgha-sâtaka*m* aneka-kkhattu*m* obhai*ñg*itvâ ova*tt*ika*m*
karontena nivattha*m* vâ, padakkhi*n*a-passesu vâ nirantara*m* valiyo
dassetvâ nivattha*m*. Sa*k*e pana *g*â*n*uto pa*tth*âya eko vâ dve vâ
valiyo pa*ññ*âyanti, va*tt*ati (B.). Compare vallikâ and ova*tt*ika*m*
at V, 2, I. Buddhaghosa's second explanation would be possible if the
reading were sata-valika*m*, and is probably only a pis aller, due to
the difficulty of the first, which we have adopted doubtfully.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[145:6](sbe20044.htm#fr_401.md) Pârupati as
opposed to nivâseti above. Compare Dhammapada, pp. 154, 376; *G*âtaka,
vol. i, p. 57, line 16.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[146:1](sbe20044.htm#fr_403.md) Sa*m*velliya*m*
nivâsetabba*m* See Buddhaghosa's note at p. 319 of the text.
