### 13.

1\. Now at that time the water as they went along could not be drunk
without breaking the rules <span id="fr_240"></span>[3](#fn_234.md), as
they had no strainers.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a strainer.' The little cloth (that
was used for a strainer) was not sufficient (to filter enough water for
the whole party).

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a strainer fixed on to a
ladle <span id="fr_241"></span>[1](#fn_235.md)'.'

Still the little cloth was not sufficient for the purpose.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a regulation water-pot <span
id="fr_242"></span>[2](#fn_236.md)'

2\. Now at that time two Bhikkhus were travelling along the high-road in
the Kosala country. One of the Bhikkhus was guilty of some
transgression. The other one said to him, 'Do not, my friend, do such a
thing. It is not becoming.' The first one bore a grudge against
him <span id="fr_243"></span>[3](#fn_237.md). Afterwards the other Bhikkhu,
being tormented with thirst, said to the Bhikkhu who bore the grudge,
'Give me, friend, your strainer. I am going to drink some water.' The
Bhikkhu who bore the grudge would not give it to him. The other Bhikkhu
died of thirst <span id="fr_244"></span>[4](#fn_238.md). Then that Bhikkhu,
when he had arrived at the Ârâma, told this matter to the Bhikkhus.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

'What then, Sir? when asked for your strainer, would you not lend it?'

'It is even so, Sirs.'

Those Bhikkhus who were moderate were annoyed and vexed, and murmured,
saying, 'How can a Bhikkhu, when asked for his strainer, refuse to lend
it?' And they told this matter to the Blessed One.

Then the Blessed One on that occasion and in that connection (&c., as
usual, see for instance in *K*ullavagga I, 1, 2, down to) addressed the
Bhikkhus, and said:

'A Bhikkhu who is on a journey is not, O Bhikkhus, to refuse to lend his
strainer, when he is asked for it. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of
a dukka*t*a. And (a Bhikkhu who is) not provided with a strainer, O
Bhikkhus, is not to undertake a journey. Whosoever does so, shall be
guilty of a dukka*t*a. If there be no strainer nor regulation water-pot,
the corner of the upper robe is to be adopted <span
id="fr_245"></span>[1](#fn_239.md) for the purpose of straining before
drinking.'

3\. Now the Blessed One, journeying straight on, arrived in due course
at Vesâlî. And there at Vesâlî the Blessed One lodged in the Mahâvana,
in the Kû*t*âgâra Hall.

Now at that time the Bhikkhus were engaged in building <span
id="fr_246"></span>[2](#fn_240.md); and the strainer did not act <span
id="fr_247"></span>[3](#fn_241.md).

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a double strainer <span
id="fr_248"></span>[1](#fn_242.md).'

The double strainer did not act.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a filter <span
id="fr_249"></span>[2](#fn_243.md).'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus were troubled <span
id="fr_250"></span>[3](#fn_244.md) by mosquitoes.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of mosquito curtains <span
id="fr_251"></span>[4](#fn_245.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_234"></span>[99:3](sbe20028.htm#fr_240.md) The rule, that is,
against destroying the life of living things.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[100:1](sbe20028.htm#fr_241.md)
Ka*t*a*kkh*u-parissâvana*m* nâma tîsu da*nd*akesu vinandhitvâ kata*m*
(B.).

<span id="fn_236"></span>[100:2](sbe20028.htm#fr_242.md) Dhamma-karaka*m*.
Doubtless a water-pot with a strainer so fixed into it that a quantity
of water could be filtered quickly. The word occurs at Mahâva*m*sa, p.
90, and below, VI, 21, 3.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[100:3](sbe20028.htm#fr_243.md) So tasmi*m*
upanandhi. The Introductory Story in the Sutta-vibhaṅga on the 36th
Pâ*k*ittiya is, so far, word for word the same as this section.
Buddhaghosa there explains upanandhi by *g*anita-upanâho. See vol. iv,
p. 359, of H.O.'s edition of the Vinaya Pi*t*aka. The Introductory Story
to the 31st *G*âtaka is also based on a similar incident, and there the
corresponding expression is vivâda*m* aka*m*su. (Fausböll's *G*âtaka,
vol. i, p. 198.)

<span id="fn_238"></span>[100:4](sbe20028.htm#fr_244.md) In the *G*âtaka
commentary this tragic result of the refusal is absent. The Bhikkhu who
has no strainer merely drinks without straining. (Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist
Birth Stories,' vol. i, p. 278.)

<span id="fn_239"></span>[101:1](sbe20028.htm#fr_245.md) Adhi*tth*âtabbo,
that is, the Bhikkhu is to determine in his mind that that part of his
robe is a strainer for the time.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[101:2](sbe20028.htm#fr_246.md) Navakamma*m*
karonti. On the use of this and allied idioms, see *G*âtaka I, 92, line
22; *K*ullavagga I, 18, 1, VI, 5, 2; Bhikkhunî-vibhaṅga, Pârâ*g*ika I,
1; Indian Antiquary XI, 29; Senart's Ka*kk*âyana, p. 189.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[101:3](sbe20028.htm#fr_247.md) Na sammati, which
is curious. For 'did not suffice,' the standing expression would be na
ppahoti.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[102:1](sbe20028.htm#fr_248.md)
Da*nd*a-parissâvana*m*. Apparently a long box, both ends of which strain
the water, which is poured into the middle by means of a pipe
(da*nd*aka). Buddhaghosa says, Da*nd*a-parisâvanan ti (sic; only one s)
ra*g*anakâna*m* khâra-parisâvana*m* viya *k*atusu pâdesu
baddha-nise*n*ikâya sâ*t*aka*m* bandhitvâ ma*ggh*e da*nd*ake udaka*m*
âsi*ñk*itabba*m*. Tam ubhohi ko*tth*âsehi pûretvâ parisâvati. Compare
da*nd*a-satthaka*m* and da*nd*a-kathina*m*, above, V, 11, 1, 3.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[102:2](sbe20028.htm#fr_249.md) Ottharaka*m* nâma
ya*m* udake ottharitvâ gha*t*akena udaka*m* ga*n*hanti. Ta*m* hi
*k*atusu da*nd*akesu vettha*m* bandhitvâ sabbe pariyante udakato
mo*k*etvâ ma*ggh*e ottharitvâ gha*t*ena udaka*m* ga*n*hanti (B.).

<span id="fn_244"></span>[102:3](sbe20028.htm#fr_250.md) Ubbâ*lh*â. See
Mahâvagga III, 9, 1-4, and *G*âtaka I, 300.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[102:4](sbe20028.htm#fr_251.md) Makasa-ku*t*ikâ ti
*k*îvara-ku*t*ikâ (B.). Literally, a 'mosquito hut,' the walls of which
are to be of cloth.
