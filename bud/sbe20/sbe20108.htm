<p>1. Now at that time there were found among the Bhikkhun&icirc;s some who were [deformed in one or other of eleven ways]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_919"></A><A HREF="#fn_905"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that a woman on whom the upasampad&acirc; initiation is being conferred, is to be questioned as touching the four-and-twenty Disqualifications&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_920"></A><A HREF="#fn_906"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. And thus, O Bhikkhus, is she to be questioned:</p>  
<p>(1-11) "Have you any one or other of the eleven deformities [each repeated as above]?"</p>  
<p>(12-16) "Have you any of the following diseases--leprosy, boils, dry leprosy, consumption, or fits?"</p>  
<p>(17) "Are you a human being&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_921"></A><A HREF="#fn_907"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>?"</p>  
<p>(18) "Are you a female?"</p>  
<p>(.19) "Are you a free woman?"</p>  
<p>(20) "Are you free from debts?"</p>  
<p>(21) "Are you not in the king's service?"</p>  
<p>(22) "Have your father and mother given their consent?"</p>  
<p>(23) "Are you full twenty years of age?"</p>  
<p>(24) "Are you duly provided with robes and alms-bowl?"</p>  
<p>"What is your name?"</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_350"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 350</FONT></A></p>  
<p>"What is the name of your proposer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_922"></A><A HREF="#fn_908"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>?"'</p>  
<p>2. Now at that time Bhikkhus put the questions as touching the Disqualifications to Bhikkhun&icirc;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_923"></A><A HREF="#fn_909"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and they who were seeking after the upasampad&acirc; initiation became disconcerted and perplexed, and were unable to answer.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that initiation is to be conferred in the Bhikkhu-sa<I>m</I>gha upon a Bhikkhun&icirc; who has been initiated on the one side in the Bhikkhun&icirc;-sa<I>m</I>gha, and has there cleared herself (from the Disqualifications).'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the Bhikkhun&icirc;s questioned those who desired to receive the upasampad&acirc; initiation about the Disqualifications, without having had them instructed beforehand (how to answer). The persons who desired to be ordained became disconcerted and perplexed, and were not able to answer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_924"></A><A HREF="#fn_910"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you first instruct the women about to be initiated (how to answer), and that you then question them as to the Disqualifications.'</p>  
<p>Then they instructed the candidates in the midst of the assembly, and they still became disconcerted, and could not answer.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_351"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 351</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that they be instructed aside, and then questioned in the midst of the assembly.</p>  
<p>And thus, O Bhikkhus, ought they to be instructed:--First they ought to be made to choose an instructor&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_925"></A><A HREF="#fn_911"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; when they have chosen an instructor their robes and bowl must be shown to them: "This is your alms-bowl, this is your waist-cloth, this is your upper garment, this is your under garment, this is your vest, this is your bathing dress&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_926"></A><A HREF="#fn_912"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Go and stand in such and such a place."'</p>  
<p>3. Ignorant and incompetent (Bhikkhun&icirc;s) instructed them, and they became disconcerted, perplexed, and unable to answer.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'They are not to be instructed, O Bhikkhus, by unlearned, incompetent Bhikkhun&icirc;s. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that they be instructed by learned and competent Bhikkhun&icirc;s.'</p>  
<p>4. Bhikkhun&icirc;s not appointed (to the office of doing so) instructed them.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, instruct them without</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_352"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 352</FONT></A></p>  
<p>having been appointed thereto. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that a Bhikkhun&icirc; appointed to the office instruct them.</p>  
<p>'And thus, O Bhikkhus, ought she to be appointed--one may either appoint herself, or one may be appointed by another. And how is a Bhikkhun&icirc; to appoint herself? Let a learned, competent Bhikkhun&icirc; lay the following motion (<I>&ntilde;</I>atti) before the Sa<I>m</I>gha "Let the Sa<I>m</I>gha, reverend Ladies, hear me. N. N. desires to receive the upasampad&acirc; initiation from the venerable lady, M. M. If it seem meet to the Sa<I>m</I>gha, I will instruct N. N." Thus may a Bhikkhun&icirc; appoint herself.</p>  
<p>And how is a Bhikkhun&icirc; to be appointed by another? Let a learned, competent Bhikkhun&icirc; lay the following resolution before the Sa<I>m</I>gha: "Let the Sa<I>m</I>gha, reverend Ladies, hear me. N. N. desires to receive the upasampad&acirc; initiation from the venerable lady, M. M. If it seem meet to the Sa<I>m</I>gha, let A. A. instruct N. N." Thus may one Bhikkhun&icirc; be appointed by another.</p>  
<p>5. 'Then let that so appointed Bhikkhun&icirc; go to the person who is seeking to be initiated, and thus address her: "Listen to me, N. N. This is the time for you to speak the truth, to declare that which is. When you are asked about what has happened before the Sa<I>m</I>gha, you ought, if it is so, to answer: "That is so;" if it is not so, to answer: "That is not so," Be not perplexed, be not disconcerted. I shall ask you thus: "Are you deformed (&amp;c., down to the end of the twenty-six questions in &sect; 1)."'</p>  
<p>(After the instruction was over, the instructor and the candidate) returned together to the assembly.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_353"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 353</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'They are not to return together. Let the instructor return first, and lay the following resolution before the Sa<I>m</I>gha: "Let the Sa<I>m</I>gha, reverend Ladies, hear me. N. N. desires to receive the upasampad&acirc; initiation from the venerable lady, M. M.; and she has been instructed by me. If it seem meet to the Sa<I>m</I>gha, let N. N. come forward." Then let her be told to come forward. Then let her be told to adjust her upper robe over one shoulder only, to bow down before the Bhikkhun&icirc;s, to sit down on her heels, and stretching forth her joined palms, to ask for the upasampad&acirc; initiation, saying: "I ask the Sa<I>m</I>gha, reverend Ladies, for initiation. May the Sa<I>m</I>gha, reverend Ladies, raise me up (out of the worldly life), having pity on me." And a second and a third time is she to repeat that request.</p>  
<p>6. 'Then let a learned and competent Bhikkhun&icirc; lay the following resolution before the Sa<I>m</I>gha: "Let the Sa<I>m</I>gha, reverend Ladies, hear me. This person, N. N., desires to receive the upasampad&acirc; initiation from M. M.; and she has been instructed by me. If it seem meet to the Sa<I>m</I>gha, let me question N. N. as touching the Disqualifications. Listen to me, N. N. [as before, down to the end of the questions]."</p>  
<p>7. 'Then let a learned and competent Bhikkhun&icirc; lay the following motion before the Sa<I>m</I>gha: "Let the Sa<I>m</I>gha, reverend Ladies, hear me. This person, N. N., desires to receive the upasampad&acirc; initiation from the venerable lady, M. M. She is free from the Disqualifications, and is duly provided with alms-bowl and robes. This person, N. N., asks the Sa<I>m</I>gha for the upasampad&acirc; initiation, the venerable</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_354"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 354</FONT></A></p>  
<p>lady, M. M., being her proposer. If it seem meet to the Sa<I>m</I>gha, let the Sa<I>m</I>gha receive N. N., the venerable lady, M. M., being her proposer. That, then, is the motion.</p>  
<p>'"Let the Sa<I>m</I>gha, venerable Ladies, hear me. N. N. desires to receive the upasampad&acirc;, the lady, M. M., being her proposer. The Sa<I>m</I>gha confers the upasampad&acirc; upon N. N., the lady, M. M., being her proposer. Whosoever of the venerable ones agrees thereto, let her keep silence; whosoever agrees not thereto, let her speak. A second time I say the same thing." [The whole of this paragraph repeated.] And a third time I say the same thing. [Paragraph repeated.]</p>  
<p>'The Sa<I>m</I>gha has conferred the upasampad&acirc; upon N. N., the lady, M. M., being her proposer. The Sa<I>m</I>gha agrees thereto. Therefore is it silent. Thus do I understand.'</p>  
<p>8. 'Then, further, let her be taken before the Bhikkhu-sa<I>m</I>gha, and there told to arrange her robe over one shoulder only, to bow down before the Bhikkhus, and, sitting down on her heels, to stretch forth her joined palms, and say: "I, Sirs, N. N., who, being desirous of receiving the upasampad&acirc; initiation from M. M., have received it on the one side (of the Sa<I>m</I>gha, from the Bhikkhun&icirc;s), and have there been declared free (from the Disqualifications), do hereby ask the Sa<I>m</I>gha for the upasampad&acirc;." [The rest of the proceedings are the same as before the Bhikkhun&icirc;-sa<I>m</I>gha.] "May the Sa<I>m</I>gha, reverend Sirs, raise me up (out of the worldly life), having pity on me." And a second time do I hereby ask [&amp;c., repeated]. And a third time do I hereby ask [the same repeated].</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_355"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 355</FONT></A></p>  
<p>[The rest of the proceedings are the same as in the last sections 6 and 7, putting 'Bhikkhu' for 'Bhikkhun&icirc;,' and 'reverend Sirs' for 'reverend Ladies.]</p>  
<p>'Then, further, let them (the Bhikkhus) measure the shadow, tell (the newly-received Bhikkhun&icirc;) what season and what date it is, tell her what part of the day it is, tell her the whole formula&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_927"></A><A HREF="#fn_913"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and tell the Bhikkhun&icirc;s: "You are to teach her what are the three things allowed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_928"></A><A HREF="#fn_914"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and what are the eight things interdicted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_929"></A><A HREF="#fn_915"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>."'</p>
