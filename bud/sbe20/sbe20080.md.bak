### 2.

1\. Now at that time resident Bhikkhus, on seeing incoming Bhikkhus, did
not prepare seats for them, nor provide water and footstools and towels
for them to wash their feet, nor go to meet them and take charge of
their bowls and their robes, nor ask them whether they wanted
drinking-water <span id="fr_796"></span>[3](#fn_782.md), nor salute such of
the incoming Bhikkhus as were their seniors, nor make beds ready for
them.

The moderate Bhikkhus murmured, &c., and told the matter to the Blessed
One, &c., (down to) he said to the Bhikkhus: 'Therefore, O Bhikkhus,

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

do I establish a rule of conduct for resident Bhikkhus, according to
which they ought to behave.

2\. 'A resident Bhikkhu, on seeing an incoming Bhikkhu, who is senior to
him, ought to make ready a seat for him, provide water and a footstool
and a towel for him to wash his feet; go to meet him, and take charge of
his robe and his bowl, ask him if he wants water to drink, and if he can
(bring himself to do so), he ought to wipe his sandals. In wiping the
sandals, they should be first wiped with a dry cloth, then with a wet
one, and the cloths ought then to be washed, and put aside.

 <span id="fr_797"></span>[1](#fn_783.md) 'An incoming Bhikkhu ought to be
saluted. A bed should be laid for him, saying, "This bed is for you." He
should be informed whether (the bed-room) is occupied or not, what are
lawful and what are unlawful resorts, and what families have been
officially declared to be in want. He should be told where the
retiring-places are, and the drinking and washing water, and the staves,
and the place for the conferences of the Sa*m*gha, and what is the time
when he ought to enter, and ought to leave (it).

3\. 'If (the incoming Bhikkhu) be junior to him, then (the resident
Bhikkhu), keeping his seat, should tell him where he is to put his bowl
and his robe away, and on which mat he is to sit down. The incoming
Bhikkhu should be informed where the drinking and washing water are, and
the cloths to clean sandals with; he should be allowed to salute the
resident Bhikkhu: and he should be told

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

where his bed is, saying, "That bed is for you." He should be informed
whether (that bedroom) is occupied or not (and so on, as in last
paragraph, down to the end).

'This, O Bhikkhus, is the rule of conduct for resident Bhikkhus,
according to which they ought to behave.'
