### 10.

1\. Now at that time Bhikkhunîs wore long girdles, and out of them they
arranged fringes <span id="fr_890"></span>[2](#fn_876.md). The people
murmured, were indignant, and complained, saying: 'As the women who are
still enjoying the pleasures of the world do!'

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to wear a long girdle. Whosoever does
so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I allow a Bhikkhunî, O Bhikkhus, a
girdle that will go once round the body <span
id="fr_891"></span>[1](#fn_877.md), and fringes are not to be arranged in
it. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time Bhikkhunîs arranged fringes in cloth of bambû
fibre <span id="fr_892"></span>[2](#fn_878.md), or in leather, or in white
cotton cloth <span id="fr_893"></span>[3](#fn_879.md), or in plaited cotton
cloth <span id="fr_894"></span>[4](#fn_880.md), or in fringed cotton
cloth <span id="fr_895"></span>[5](#fn_881.md), or in white or, in plaited
or in fringed *k*ola cloth <span id="fr_896"></span>[6](#fn_882.md), or in
plaits or fringes made of thread. The people murmured, were indignant,
and complained, saying: 'As the women who are still enjoying the
pleasures of the world do!'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to wear any of these things. Whosoever
does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

2\. Now at that time Bhikkhunîs had their backs scrubbed with the
steak-bone of an ox, or slapped with the jaw-bone of an ox; and had
their fore-arms <span id="fr_897"></span>[7](#fn_883.md),

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

and the backs of their hands <span id="fr_898"></span>[1](#fn_884.md), and
their calves <span id="fr_899"></span>[2](#fn_885.md), and the upper part
of their feet <span id="fr_900"></span>[3](#fn_886.md), and their thighs,
and their faces, and their gums, so slapped. The people murmured, were
indignant, and complained, saying: 'As the women who are still enjoying
the pleasures of the world do!'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to \[do any of these things\].
Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

3\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhunîs \[&c., down to\]

' <span id="fr_901"></span>[4](#fn_887.md)A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus,
to anoint her face, nor to rub ointments on to her face <span
id="fr_902"></span>[5](#fn_888.md), nor to put chunam on to her face, nor
to smear red arsenic on to her face, nor to paint her body, nor to paint
her face, nor to paint her body and face. Whosoever does so, shall be
guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

4\. \[Similar paragraph concluding,\]

'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to make (tattoo marks) by the corners
of her eyes <span id="fr_903"></span>[6](#fn_889.md), or on her
cheeks <span id="fr_904"></span>[7](#fn_890.md), nor to peep out of
window <span id="fr_905"></span>[8](#fn_891.md), nor to stand in the

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

light (of a half-opened door) <span id="fr_906"></span>[1](#fn_892.md), nor
to have dances performed, nor to keep courtesans, nor to keep a tavern,
nor to keep a slaughter-house, nor to open a shop, nor, to practise
usury, nor to supply men slaves or women slaves, or men servants or maid
servants, or animals, nor to carry on the business of florist and
seedsman <span id="fr_907"></span>[2](#fn_893.md), nor to carry the razor
case <span id="fr_908"></span>[3](#fn_894.md).'

\[Similar paragraph concluding,\]

'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to wear robes that are all of a blue,
light yellow, crimson, black, brownish-yellow, or dark yellow colour nor
to wear robes with skirts to them which are not made of torn pieces of
cloth, or are long, or have flowers worked on them, or cobras' hoods;
nor to wear jackets, nor dresses made of the fibre of the Tirîtaka
plant <span id="fr_909"></span>[4](#fn_895.md). Whosoever does so, shall be
guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

<span id="fn_876"></span>[340:2](sbe20101.htm#fr_890.md) Pâsuke namentîti
gihidârikâyo viya ghanapa*tt*akena kâyabandhanena pâsuke namanatthâya
bandhanti, says Buddhaghosa. Pâsuka is probably equal to the Sanskrit
pâr*s*vaka, and means a fringe arranged round the body, as shown in
Plate LI of Cunningham's 'Bharhut Tope,' being so called from the
rib-like arrangement of the strings or cloth or other substance of which
it was made. On corresponding girdles worn by men and forbidden to
Bhikkhus, see *K*ullavagga V, 29, 2.

<span id="fn_877"></span>[341:1](sbe20101.htm#fr_891.md) Ekapariyâkatan ti

ko*tt*âpentîti agga*m* bâha*m* ko*tt*âpetvâ morapattâdîhi *k*ittaka*m*
karonti, says Buddhaghosa. The meaning is not clear. No. 10 of the
tattoo marks figured on Plate LII of Cunningham's 'Bharhut Tope,'
referred to in the note on the next section, is a representation of a
peacock's feathers. On a*tth*illa, see Buddhaghosa's note at p. 327 of
the text. Compare the prohibition of the use by Bhikkhus of
back-scratchers and other like things (*K*ullavagga V, 1, 1) connected
with shampooing of luxurious bathing.

<span id="fn_887"></span>[342:4](sbe20101.htm#fr_901.md) This paragraph has
already occurred above, V, 2, 5 of the Bhikkhus.

<span id="fn_888"></span>[342:5](sbe20101.htm#fr_902.md) These two
injunctions are found also in the 90th and 91st Bhikkhunî Pâ*k*ittiyas.

<span id="fn_889"></span>[342:6](sbe20101.htm#fr_903.md) Avaṅga*m*

Sanskrit apâṅga.

(B.). A number of tattoo marks on the cheeks are figured in Plate LII of
Cunningham's 'Bharhut Tope.'

pa*nn*ika-upâsako in the *G*âtaka I, 411 = II, 180.

<span id="fn_894"></span>[343:3](sbe20101.htm#fr_908.md) Namataka*m*
dhâreti. See V, 27, 3, and our note above on V, 11, 1. The expression
evidently means here 'to be a barber.'

<span id="fn_895"></span>[343:4](sbe20101.htm#fr_909.md) This paragraph has
already occurred above, in respect to the Bhikkhus (Mahâvagga VIII, 29),
where see our notes on the various items.
