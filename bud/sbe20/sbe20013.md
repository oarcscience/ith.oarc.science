### 12.

1\. 'There are five things, O Bhikkhus, which are necessary to the valid
carrying out of the Tassapâpiyyasikâ-kamma. To wit--he is impure, he is
shameless--a censure has been set on foot against him <span
id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_58.md)--the Sa*m*gha carries out the Kamma--it
carries it out lawfully, and in a full quorum.

2\. 'There are three things, O Bhikkhus, by which, when a
Tassa-pâpiyyasikâ-kamma is characterised, it is against the Dhamma, and
against the Vinaya, and difficult to be settled; (that is to say), when
it has not been carried out in a full assembly of properly qualified
persons, according to law and justice, and in the presence of the
litigant parties--when it has been carried out without the accused
person having been heard--when it has been carried out without the
accused person having confessed himself guilty.

'These are the three things, O Bhikkhus, by which, when a
Tassa-pâpiyyasikâ-kamma is characterised, it is against the Dhamma, and
against the Vinaya, and difficult to be settled.

There are three things by which (and as in last paragraph) it is in
accordance with the Dhamma, and in accordance with the Vinaya, and easy
to be settled; (that is to say), when it has been \[&c., the rest of
this paragraph is the reverse of the last\] <span

3\. \[This paragraph exactly corresponds to *K*ullavagga I, 4, paragraph
1, as to the three cases in which the Sa*m*gha, if it likes, may carry
out the Tassa-pâpiyyasikâ-kamma against a Bhikkhu.\]

4\. \[In this paragraph the 'right conduct' for a Bhikkhu who has been
subjected to this Kamma is laid down precisely as in I, 5 for a Bhikkhu
subjected to the Ta*gg*aniya-kamma.\]

Then the Sa*m*gha carried out the Tassa-pâpiyyasikâ-kamma against
Uvâ*l*a the Bhikkhu.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_58"></span>[30:1](sbe20013.htm#fr_59.md) Compare the use of
anuvâdo in *K*ullavagga I, 5.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[30:2](sbe20013.htm#fr_60.md) These paragraphs
exactly correspond to paragraphs at *K*ullavagga I, 2. It is probably
merely owing to this repetition that it is here also prescribed that the
accused person must confess <span id="page_31">p. 31</span> himself
guilty, as it must be evident from the Introductory Story, that he will
not do so.
