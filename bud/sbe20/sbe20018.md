### 3.

1\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to sing the Dhamma
with the abrupt transitions of song-singing.

The people murmured, were annoyed, and became indignant, saying, 'How
can the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as \[do so\]?' The Bhikkhus heard (&c., as
usual, down to) he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

'These five dangers, O Bhikkhus, befall him who sings the Dhamma with
the abrupt <span id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_143) transitions of
song-singing.--He himself becomes captivated with respect to the sound
thereof.--Other people become captivated with respect to the sound
thereof.--The laymen are shocked.--The meditation of one who strains
after accuracy in the sound is broken.--The common people fall into
heresy <span id="fr_149"></span>[2](#fn_144).--These five dangers, O
Bhikkhus, befall him who sings the Dhamma with the abrupt transitions of
song-singing. The Dhamma is not, O Bhikkhus, to be sung \[in that
manner\]. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

2\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus were afraid to make use of
intoning <span id="fr_150"></span>[3](#fn_145). They told this matter to
the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to intone.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_143"></span>[72:1](sbe20018.htm#fr_148) Âyatakena
gîta-ssarena. Compare âyataken’ eva papâto at *K*ullavagga IX, 1, 3.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[72:2](sbe20018.htm#fr_149) Probably this is
supposed to result because dhamma being sung and not said is not
intelligible to them--a complaint often made against the singing of
prayers among Protestant Christians. On pa*kkh*imâ *g*anatâ, compare the
closing words of V, 21, 2; and on the rest of the phrase, Puggala III,
10, 14 The translation of sarakutti*m* is also very doubtful.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[72:3](sbe20018.htm#fr_150) Sara-bha*ññ*a*m*.
So in the Mahâvagga we hear that So*n*a <span id="page_73">p. 73</span>
intoned before the Buddha a chapter from the Sutta Nipâta. The
expression there used is sarena abhâsi, of which our word is used as the
verbal noun, the roots bha*n* and bhâs being not only synonymous but
interchangeable. (See, for instance, Vin. Pit. vol. iv, p. 353.) Perhaps
'recitative' would be a good rendering. I have several times heard the
Dhamma thus recited by living Buddhists in accordance with the
traditional interpretation of this passage, and their Sara-bha*ññ*a*m*
was precisely like the intoning of prose passages as practised in our
cathedral churches (Rh. D.).
