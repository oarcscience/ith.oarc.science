### 12.

1\. Now the venerable Upananda the Sâkyan, after having had a lodging
allotted to him in

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sâvatthi, went to
a certain country-place where a community of the Sa*m*gha resided, and
there also had a lodging allotted to him. Then the Bhikkhus there
thought, 'Now this brother, Upananda the Sâkyan, is a maker of strife,
quarrelsome, a maker of disputes, given to idle talk, a raiser of legal
questions in the Sa*m*gha <span id="fr_592"></span>[1](#fn_582.md). If he
should spend the rainy season here, then shall we all dwell in
discomfort. Come, let us question him.' And they asked the venerable
Upananda the Sâkyan:

'Have not you, friend Upananda, had a lodging allotted to you in
Sâvatthi?'

That is so, Sirs.'

'What then do you, friend Upananda, being one, yet take exclusive
possession of two (lodging-places)?'

'Well, I do now, Sirs, set (the lodging) here free, and take the one
there.'

Those Bhikkhus who were moderate murmured, &c., and they told the matter
to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that
connection, convened a meeting of the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha, and asked the
venerable Upananda the Sâkyan:

'Is it true, Upananda, that you, being one, have taken possession of two
places?'

'It is true, Lord.'

Then the Blessed One rebuked him, saying, 'How can you, O foolish one,
do such a thing? What you took there, O foolish one, has been lost here;
what you took here, has been lost there <span
id="fr_593"></span>[2](#fn_583.md). Thus, O

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

foolish one, you are deprived of both.' And when he had delivered a
religious discourse, he said to the Bhikkhus:

'One man is not, O Bhikkhus, to take two lodging-places. Whosoever does
so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_582"></span>[205:1](sbe20064.htm#fr_592.md) These are the acts
which render a Bhikkhu liable to the Ta*gg*aniya Kamma. See *K*ullavagga
I, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_583"></span>[205:2](sbe20064.htm#fr_593.md) That is, by taking
a lodging here you ipso facto renounced <span id="page_206">p.
206</span> your right to a lodging there, and by taking one there you
ipso facto renounced your right to get one here.
