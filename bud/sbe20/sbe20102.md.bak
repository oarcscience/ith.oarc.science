### 11.

1\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhunî, when on her death-bed, said:
'After I am gone, let my set of necessaries <span

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bhikkhus and the
Bhikkhunîs disputed as to it,' saying: 'It belongs to us; it belongs to
us.'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'If, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhunî, or a novice under training to become one
(a Sikkhamânâ), when on her death-bed, should say: "After I am gone, let
my set of necessaries belong to the Sa*m*gha," then it is the
Bhikkhunî-sa*m*gha it belongs to; the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha is not the owner
thereof. If a Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, or a novice under training to become
one (a Sâma*n*era), when on his death-bed, should say: "After I am gone,
let my set of necessaries become the property of the Sa*m*gha," then it
is the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha it belongs to; the Bhikkhunî-sa*m*gha is not the
owner thereof <span id="fr_911"></span>[1](#fn_897.md)'

is, the eight things over which a member <span id="page_344">p.
344</span> of the Buddhist Order was allowed proprietary rights--the
three robes, the alms-bowl, razor, needle, girdle, and water-strainer.

<span id="fn_897"></span>[344:1](sbe20102.htm#fr_911.md) By the rule laid
down in the Mahâvagga VIII, 27, the set of robes and the bowl are to be
assigned by the Sa*m*gha to those that waited on the sick--at least in
the case of Bhikkhus,--and the analogy would doubtless hold good of the
Bhikkhunîs also.
