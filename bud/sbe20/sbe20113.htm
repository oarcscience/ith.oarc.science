<p>1. Now at that time a courtesan named A<I>d</I><I>dh</I>ak&acirc;s&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_941"></A><A HREF="#fn_925"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> had adopted the religious life under the Bhikkhun&icirc;s, and she wanted to go to S&acirc;vatthi to be received as full member of the Order (to receive the upasampad&acirc; initiation) by the Blessed One himself. And men of abandoned life heard of it, and beset the road. And when A<I>d</I><I>dh</I>ak&acirc;s&icirc;, the courtesan, heard that they had done so, she sent a messenger to the Blessed One, saying: 'I want to receive the upasampad&acirc; initiation: what course of action should I adopt?'</p>  
<p>Then the Blessed One, in that connection, addressed the Bhikkhus, after delivering a religious discourse&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_942"></A><A HREF="#fn_926"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and said: 'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to confer the upasampad&acirc; initiation (upon Bhikkhun&icirc;s) even by a messenger&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_943"></A><A HREF="#fn_927"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.'</p>

<p><A NAME="page_361"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 361</FONT></A></p>  
<p>2. They conferred it by (sending) a Bhikkhu as the messenger.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to confer the upasampad&acirc; initiation on a Bhikkhun&icirc; by sending a Bhikkhu as messenger. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>They conferred it by sending a female student . . . . . a male novice . . . . . a female novice . . . . . an ignorant, incompetent Bhikkhun&icirc;, as the messenger.</p>  
<p>[Similar decision in each case.]</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to confer the upasampad&acirc; initiation by sending a learned, competent Bhikkhun&icirc;, as a messenger.'</p>  
<p>3. 'That Bhikkhun&icirc; messenger is to go before the Sa<I>m</I>gha, and arranging her robe over one shoulder, is to bow down before the Sa<I>m</I>gha, and sitting on her heels, to stretch forth her joined palms, and say "N. N., having been desirous of receiving the upasampad&acirc; initiation with the lady, M. M. (as her proposer), has received it on the one hand from the Bhikkhun&icirc;-sa<I>m</I>gha, and has there been declared free (from the Disqualifications&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_944"></A><A HREF="#fn_928"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>). But she is prevented by some danger or other from coming before the Sa<I>m</I>gha (to have her initiation confirmed)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_945"></A><A HREF="#fn_929"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. N. N. asks the Sa<I>m</I>gha for initiation, Let the Sa<I>m</I>gha raise her up (out of the worldly life) out of compassion upon her.' [To be said thrice.]</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_362"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 362</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'Then let a learned, competent Bhikkhu lay the motion before the Sa<I>m</I>gha. "Let the Sa<I>m</I>gha, venerable Sirs, hear me. N. N., having been desirous . . . . . [statement of fact, as before]. If it seem meet to the Sa<I>m</I>gha, let the Sa<I>m</I>gha confer the upasampad&acirc; initiation upon N. N., M. M. being her proposer. That is the motion.</p>  
<p>'"Let the Sa<I>m</I>gha, venerable Sirs, hear me. N. N., . . . . [statement of fact, as before]. The Sa<I>m</I>gha hereby confers the upasampad&acirc; initiation upon N. N., M. M. being her proposer. Whosoever of the venerable ones approves thereof, let him keep silence. Whosoever approves not thereof, let him speak. And a second time I say the same thing. N. N., . . . . . (&amp;c., down to) let him speak. And a third time I say the same thing. N. N., . . . . . (&amp;c., down to) let him speak.</p>  
<p>'"The Sa<I>m</I>gha has hereby conferred the upasampad&acirc; initiation upon N. N., M. M. being her proposer. The Sa<I>m</I>gha approves thereof. Therefore is it silent. Thus do I understand."'</p>  
<p>'Then, further, let them (the Bhikkhus) measure the shadow, tell (the messenger that she may tell the newly-received Bhikkhun&icirc;) what season and what date it is, tell her what part of the day it is, tell her the whole formula; and tell the Bhikkhun&icirc;s to teach her what are the three things allowed, and what are the eight things interdicted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_946"></A><A HREF="#fn_930"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>
