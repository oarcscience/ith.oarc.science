He should be told where the retiring-places are, and the drinking and washing water, and the staves, and the place for the conferences of the Sa<I>m</I>gha, and what is the time when he ought to enter, and ought to leave (it).</p>

The incoming Bhikkhu should be informed where the drinking and washing water are, and the cloths to clean sandals with; he should be allowed to salute the resident Bhikkhu: and he should be told</p>
