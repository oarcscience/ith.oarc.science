# NINTH KHANDHAKA.

#### ON EXCLUSION FROM THE PÂTIMOKKHA CEREMONY.

### 1.

1\. Now at that time the Blessed One was staying at Sâvatthi, in the
Eastern Ârâma, the mansion of the mother of Migâra. And at that time, it
being Uposatha Day, the Blessed One was seated in the midst of the
Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha. And the venerable Ânanda, when the night was far
spent, when the first watch was passing away, arose from his seat,
arranged his robe over one shoulder, and stretching out his joined hands
towards the Blessed One, said to the Blessed One:

'The night, Lord, is far spent. The first watch is passing away. For a
long time has the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha been seated here. Let my lord the
Blessed One recite to the Bhikkhus the Pâtimokkha.'

When he had thus spoken, the Blessed One remained silent. And a second
time, when the second watch was passing away \[he made the same request
with the same result\]. And a third time, when the third watch had
begun, and the dawn was breaking <span id="fr_834"></span>[1](#fn_820.md)
he made the same request\].

The assembly, Ânanda, is not pure <span
id="fr_835"></span>[2](#fn_821.md).'

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

2\. Then the venerable Mahâ Moggallâna thought, 'What individual can the
Blessed One be referring to in that he says, "The assembly, Ânanda, is
not pure."' And the venerable Mahâ Moggallâna considered the whole
Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha, penetrating their minds with his. Then the venerable
Mahâ Moggallâna perceived who was that individual,--evil in conduct,
wicked in character, of impure and doubtful <span
id="fr_836"></span>[1](#fn_822.md) behaviour, not a Sama*n*a though he had
taken the vows of one, not a religious student though he had taken the
vows of one, foul within, full of cravings, a worthless creature,--who
had taken his seat amongst the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha. On perceiving which it
was, he went up to that individual, and said to him, 'Arise, Sir! The
Blessed One has found you out. There can be no communion <span
id="fr_837"></span>[2](#fn_823.md) between you and the Bhikkhus!'

When he had thus spoken, that man kept silence. And a second and a third
time the venerable Mahâ Moggallâna addressed to him \[the same words,
and with the same result\]. Then the venerable Mahâ Moggallâna took that
man by the arm and made him go out beyond the porch <span
id="fr_838"></span>[3](#fn_824.md), and bolted the door,

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

and went up to the place where the Blessed One was, and said to him,
'Lord, I have made that man go out. The assembly is now undefiled. May
my lord the Blessed One recite the Pâtimokkha to the Bhikkhus.'

'How astonishing and curious a thing it is, Moggallâna, that that
foolish fellow should have waited up to the very point when he had to be
taken by the arm.'

3\. And the Blessed One said to the Bhikkhus: 'There are, O Bhikkhus, in
the great ocean, then, eight astonishing and curious qualities, by the
constant perception of which the mighty creatures take delight in the
great ocean. And what are the eight?

'The great ocean, O Bhikkhus, gets gradually deeper, slope following on
slope, hollow succeeding hollow, and the fall is not precipitously
abrupt <span id="fr_839"></span>[1](#fn_825.md). This is the first \[of
such qualities\] <span id="fr_840"></span>[2](#fn_826.md).

'Again, Ô Bhikkhus, the great ocean remains of the same nature <span
id="fr_841"></span>[3](#fn_827.md), and passes not beyond the shore. This
is the second \[of such qualities\].

'Again, O Bhikkhus, the great ocean will not brook association with a
dead corpse. Whatsoever dead corpse there be in the sea, that will
it--and quickly--draw to the shore, and cast it out on the dry
ground <span id="fr_842"></span>[4](#fn_828.md). This is the third \[of
such qualities\].

'Again, O Bhikkhus, all the great rivers--that is to say, the Gaṅgâ, the
Yamunâ, the A*k*iravatî, the

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sarabhû, and the
Mahî--they, when they have fallen into the great ocean, renounce their
names and lineage, and are reckoned thenceforth as the great ocean. This
is the fourth \[of such qualities\].

'Again, O Bhikkhus, though all the streams in the world flow on till
they reach the great ocean, and all *th*e waters of the sky fall into
it, yet does it not thereby seem to be the more empty or more full. This
is the fifth \[of such qualities\].

'Again, O Bhikkhus, the great ocean has only one taste, the taste of
salt. This is the sixth \[of such qualities\].

'Again, O Bhikkhus, the great ocean is full of gems, of gems of various
kinds; among which are these gems--that is to say, the pearl, the
diamond, the catseye, the chank, rock, coral, silver, gold, the ruby,
and the cornelian <span id="fr_843"></span>[1](#fn_829.md). This is the
seventh \[of such qualities\].

'Again, O Bhikkhus, the great ocean is the dwelling-place of mighty
beings, among which are these--that is to say, the Timi, the Timiṅgala,
the Timitimiṅgala, the Asuras, the Nâgas, and the Gandhabbas. There are
in the great ocean creatures so constituted that they stretch from one
to five hundred leagues <span id="fr_844"></span>[2](#fn_830.md). This is
the eighth \[of such qualities\].

4\. 'And just in the same way, O Bhikkhus, there are in this doctrine
and discipline eight marvellous and wonderful qualities, by the constant
perception

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

of which the Bhikkhus take delight in this doctrine and discipline. What
are the eight?

'Just, O Bhikkhus, as the great ocean gets gradually deeper, slope
following on slope, hollow succeeding hollow, and the fall is not
precipitately abrupt just so, O Bhikkhus, in this doctrine and
discipline is the training a gradual one, work following on work, and
step succeeding step; and there is no sudden attainment to the insight
(of Arahatship) <span id="fr_845"></span>[1](#fn_831.md). This is the first
\[of such qualities\].

Just, O Bhikkhus, as the great ocean remains of the same nature, and
passes not beyond the shore--just so, O Bhikkhus, is the body of
precepts which I have established for those who are hearers of my word,
and which they, their lives long, do not pass beyond. This is the second
\[of such qualities\].

Just, O Bhikkhus, as the great ocean will not brook association with a
dead corpse; but whatsoever dead corpse there be in the sea that will
it--and quickly--draw to the shore, and cast it out upon the dry land
just so, O Bhikkhus, if there be any individual evil in conduct, wicked
in character, of impure and doubtful behaviour, not a Sama*n*a though he
have taken the vows of one, not a religious student though he have taken
the vows of one, foul within, full of cravings, a worthless creature;
with him will the Sa*m*gha brook no association, but quickly, on its
meeting together, will it cast him out. And what though that man should
himself be seated in the midst of the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha, verily, both is
he afar off from the Sa*m*gha,

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

and the Sa*m*gha from him. This is the third (of such qualities\].

'Just, O Bhikkhus, as the great rivers--that is to say, the Gaṅgâ, the
Yamunâ, the A*k*iravatî, the Sarabhû, and the Mahî--when they have
fallen into the great ocean, renounce their name and lineage and are
thenceforth reckoned as the great ocean just so, O Bhikkhus, do these
four castes--the Khattiyas, the Brahmans, the Vessas, and the
Suddas--when they have gone forth from the world under the doctrine and
discipline proclaimed by the Tathâgata, renounce their names and
lineage, and enter into the number of the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as. This
is the fourth \[of such qualities\].

'Just, O Bhikkhus, as though all the streams in the world flow on till
they reach the great ocean, and all the waters of the sky fall into it,
yet does it not seem thereby to be either more empty or more full just
so, O Bhikkhus, though many Bhikkhus pass entirely away in that kind of
passing away which leaves not a trace behind, yet does not \[the
Sa*m*gha\] thereby seem to be either more empty or more full. This is
the fifth \[of such qualities\].

'Just, O Bhikkhus, as the great ocean has only one taste, the taste of
salt just so, O Bhikkhus, has this doctrine and discipline only one
flavour, the flavour of emancipation. This is the sixth \[of such
qualities\].

'Just, O Bhikkhus, as the great ocean is full of gems, of gems of
various kinds--that is to say, the pearl, the diamond, the catseye, the
chank, rock, coral, silver, gold, the ruby, and the cornelian--just so,
O Bhikkhus, is this doctrine and discipline full of gems, of gems of
various kinds, among which are

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

these gems,--that is to say, the four Earnest Meditations, the fourfold
Great Struggle, the four Roads to Iddhi, the five Moral Powers, the five
Moral Senses, the seven kinds of Wisdom, and the noble eightfold Path.
This is the seventh \[of such qualities\].

'Just, O Bhikkhus, as the great ocean is the dwelling-place of mighty
beings, among which are the Timi, the Timiṅgala, the Timitimiṅgala, the
Asuras, the Nâgas. and the Gandhabbas; just as there are in the great
ocean creatures so constituted that they stretch from one to five
hundred leagues--just so, O Bhikkhus, is this doctrine and discipline
the resort of mighty beings, among whom are he who has entered the First
Path (the converted man, the Sotâpanno) and he who has realised the
fruit thereof, he who has entered the Second Path (the Sakadâgâmin) and
he who has realised the fruit thereof, he who has entered the Third Path
(the Anâgâmin) and he who has realised the fruit thereof, the Arahat,
and he who has realised the fruit of Arahatship. This is the eighth \[of
such qualities\].

'These, O Bhikkhus, are the eight marvellous and wonderful qualities in
this doctrine and discipline by the constant perception of which the
Bhikkhus take delight therein.'

And the Blessed One, on perceiving that matter, gave forth at that time
this ecstatic utterance:

'The rain falls heavily on that which is covered, not upon that which is
revealed.

'Reveal, therefore, what thou hast concealed, and the rain shall touch
thee not <span id="fr_846"></span>[1](#fn_832.md).'

We may add that the Tibetan rendering of Dhammapada 312, given in
Rockhill's 'Udâna-varga,' p. 49, from which we might expect some help,
throws no light on the exact meaning of the word, the translator
contenting himself with an ambiguous phrase.

<span id="fn_830"></span>[302:2](sbe20087.htm#fr_844.md) On this belief,
compare above, VII, 2, 2. of land creatures, where the same term,

<span id="fn_832"></span>[305:1](sbe20087.htm#fr_846.md) This enigmatical
saying amounts apparently to this: 'As a usual thing, no doubt, the rain
falls not on that which is covered <span id="page_306">p. 306</span>
with a roof; but in morals it is precisely where there is already a
fault concealed, unconfessed, that new faults rain in upon him who adds
deceit to his fault.' Buddhaghosa says, *Kh*anna*m* ativassatîti
