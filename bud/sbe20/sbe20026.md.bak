### 11.

1\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus sewed their robes together after
tearing the cloth with their hands <span
id="fr_199"></span>[2](#fn_194.md); and the robes became jagged.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a blade and of a sheath (for the
blade) made of felt <span id="fr_200"></span>[3](#fn_195.md).'

Now at that time a blade with a haft to it <span
id="fr_201"></span>[4](#fn_196.md) had come into the possession of the
Sa*m*gha.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a blade with a haft to it.'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus used various kinds of long
handles to their blades, made of silver, and made of gold.

People murmured (&c., as usual, down to) They told this matter to the
Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to use various kinds of handles to your
blades. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I allow you,
O Bhikkhus, the use of handles to your blades made of bone, or ivory. or
horn, or of the na la reed, or of bamboo, or hard wood, or of lac, or of
the shells of fruit, or of bronze, or of the centre of the
chank-shell <span id="fr_202"></span>[1](#fn_197.md):

2\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus sewed their robes with quills or bits
of bamboo rind, and the robes were badly sewn.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of needles.'

The needles got blunted <span id="fr_203"></span>[2](#fn_198.md).

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a needle-case made of bamboo <span
id="fr_204"></span>[3](#fn_199.md).'

Even in the needle-cases the needles became blunt.

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to fill the cases with chunam <span
id="fr_205"></span>[1](#fn_200.md).

Even in the chunam the needles became blunt.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to fill the cases with barley-meal <span
id="fr_206"></span>[2](#fn_201.md).'

Even in the barley-meal the needles became blunt.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of powdered stone <span
id="fr_207"></span>[3](#fn_202.md).'

Even in the powdered stone the needles became blunt.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to mix (the powder) with beeswax <span
id="fr_208"></span>[4](#fn_203.md).'

The powder still did not cohere.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to mix sipâ*t*ika gum <span
id="fr_209"></span>[5](#fn_204.md) with the powder <span
id="fr_210"></span>[6](#fn_205.md).'

3\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus sewed their robes together by planting
stakes here and there, and uniting them (with strings). The robes became
out of shape <span id="fr_211"></span>[7](#fn_206.md).'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a Ka*th*ina <span
id="fr_212"></span>[8](#fn_207.md),

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

and that you are to sew the robes together after tying down
Ka*th*ina-strings here and there.'

They spread out the Ka*th*ina on uneven (ground), and the Ka*th*ina fell
to pieces <span id="fr_213"></span>[1](#fn_208.md).

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to spread out the Ka*th*ina on uneven
(ground). Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

They spread out the Ka*th*ina on the ground, and the Ka*th*ina became
dirty.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a grass-mat.'

The edge of the Ka*th*ina decayed through age.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to strengthen it by a doubling or a binding
along the edge <span id="fr_214"></span>[2](#fn_209.md).

The Ka*th*ina was not large enough <span
id="fr_215"></span>[3](#fn_210.md).

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

da*nd*a-ka*th*ina <span id="fr_216"></span>[1](#fn_211.md), of a
pidalaka <span id="fr_217"></span>[1](#fn_211.md), of a ticket, of binding
strings, and of binding threads <span id="fr_218"></span>[2](#fn_212.md);
and that you sew your robes together after binding them therewith.'

The interstices between the threads became irregular in length <span
id="fr_219"></span>[3](#fn_213.md).

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of little marks (of the leaf of the
talipot palm, or such-like things) <span
id="fr_220"></span>[4](#fn_214.md).'

The threads became crooked.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of false threads (laid along the cloth
to show where it is to be cut or sewn) <span
id="fr_221"></span>[5](#fn_215.md).'

4\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus got on to the Ka*th*ina with unwashen
feet, or wet feet, or with their shoes on <span
id="fr_222"></span>[6](#fn_216.md), and the Ka*th*ina was soiled.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to get on to the Ka*th*ina with unwashen feet,
or with wet feet, or with your shoes on. Whosoever does so, shall be
guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

5\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus, when sewing

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

their robes, held the stuff with their fingers, and their fingers were
hurt.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a thimble <span
id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_217.md).'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus used various kinds of
thimbles; gold ones, and silver ones.

People murmured, &c. The Bhikkhus heard, &c. They told this matter to
the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to use various kinds of thimbles. Whosoever
does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus,
thimbles made of bone, or ivory, or horn, or of the na la reed, or of
bamboo, or of hard wood, or of lac, or of the shells of fruit, or of
bronze, or of the centre of the chank-shell <span
id="fr_224"></span>[2](#fn_218.md).'

Now at that time the needles, and scissors, and thimbles got lost.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a box or drawer <span
id="fr_225"></span>[3](#fn_219.md) in the workshop.'

They got crowded together in the workshop box. They told this matter to
the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a thimble bag (to carry the
thimbles about in).'

They had no shoulder-strap.

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a shoulder-strap, or of a piece of
string, to tie the bags on with <span id="fr_226"></span>[1](#fn_220.md).'

6 <span id="fr_227"></span>[2](#fn_221.md). Now at that time the Bhikkhus,
when sewing their robes in the open air, were distressed by heat and by
cold.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a hall or of a shed for the
Ka*th*ina:

The Ka*th*ina hall had too low a basement, and it was inundated with
water.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make it with a high basement <span
id="fr_228"></span>[3](#fn_222.md).'

The facing (of the basement) fell in.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to line the basement with facing of three
kinds <span id="fr_229"></span>[4](#fn_223.md)--brick facing, stone facing,
or wooden facing.'

They found difficulty in getting up into it.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of stairs of three kinds--brick
stairs, stone stairs, or wooden stairs.'

As they were going up them they fell off.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a balustrade <span
id="fr_230"></span>[5](#fn_224.md).'

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

Straw and plaster fell (from the walls and roof) into the
Ka*th*ina-hall.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to first cover over (the walls and roof with
skins <span id="fr_231"></span>[1](#fn_225).md), and then plaster them
within and without. (And I allow the use of) whitewash, and blacking,
and red colouring <span id="fr_232"></span>[2](#fn_226.md), and
wreath-work, and creeper-work, and bone hooks, and cupboards <span
id="fr_233"></span>[3](#fn_227.md), and bamboos to hang robes on, and
strings to hang robes on.'

7\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus, when they had sewn the robes
together, left the Ka*th*ina as it was, and went away; and the robes
were eaten by rats and white ants.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to fold up the Ka*th*ina.

The Ka*th*ina came to pieces.

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to fold up the Ka*th*ina in a cow-hide
(?) <span id="fr_234"></span>[1](#fn_228.md).'

The Ka*th*ina got uncovered.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of strings to tie it up with.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus went away, putting the Ka*th*ina up
against the wall or a pillar; and the Ka*th*ina, falling over, was
broken.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to hang it on a stake of the wall,. or on a
hook <span id="fr_235"></span>[2](#fn_229.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_194"></span>[90:2](sbe20026.htm#fr_199.md) Vipa*t*etvâ. The
three MSS. read vippâdetvâ, the same corrected to vipphâdetvâ, and
vipphâmetvâ. M for L is a common-mistake in Sinhalese MSS., and the
correct reading may possibly be vipphâletvâ, if it is not vipphâ*t*etvâ,
as suggested in H.O.'s note, vol. v, p. 259.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[90:3](sbe20026.htm#fr_200.md) Namatakan ti
satthaka-ve*th*anaka*m* pilotika-kha*nd*a*m* (B.). The word occurs again
below at V, 19, I, V, 27, I, and X, 10, 4 (where the nuns are forbidden
to use it). Namata is felt; and nâmatika-aṅga, the wearing of felt, is
inserted by some Sanskrit Buddhist writers in the list of Dhutaṅgas.
(Burnout, Introduction, &c., p. 306.)

<span id="fn_196"></span>[90:4](sbe20026.htm#fr_201.md) Da*nd*a-satthakan
ti vippalika*m* vâ a*ññ*a*m* pi vâ ya*m* ki*ñk*i da*nd*a*m* yo*g*etvâ
kata-satthaka*m* (B.). Compare da*nd*a-*k*a*th*ina*m* at V, II, 3, and
da*nd*a-parissâvana*m* at V, 13, 3.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[91:1](sbe20026.htm#fr_202.md) This list is given
in the Mahâvagga VI, 12, 1 (where see our notes), as the materials of
which ointment-boxes may be made; and below, V, 11, 5, of thimbles.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[91:2](sbe20026.htm#fr_203.md) Ka*nn*akitâ hontî
ti malagga-kitâ (B.). Mala may probably here. mean 'rust,' if the
needles were made of iron. Ka*nn*akitâ, 'spoiled,' is used of plastered
walls and the floors of a Vihâra at Mahâvagga I, 25, 15 = *K*ullavagga
VIII, 1, 3; and pa*m*su-kitâ occurs just below in our present passage.
Compare also the note on vika*nn*a*m* in the following section.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[91:3](sbe20026.htm#fr_204.md) Sû*k*i-nâ*li*ka*m*.
On these needle-cases compare the Introductory Story to the 10th
*G*âtaka. It is Pâ*k*ittiya to have them made of ivory, horn, or bone.
(80th Pâ*k*ittiya, but they are there called Sû*k*i-ghara*m*.)

<span id="fn_200"></span>[92:1](sbe20026.htm#fr_205.md) Ki*nn*ena
*k*u*nn*ena (B.).

<span id="fn_201"></span>[92:2](sbe20026.htm#fr_206.md) Satthuyâ ti
halidda-missakena pi*tth*a-ku*nn*ena (B.).

<span id="fn_202"></span>[92:3](sbe20026.htm#fr_207.md) Saritakan ti
pâsâna-ku*nn*a*m* vu*kk*ati (B.).

<span id="fn_203"></span>[92:4](sbe20026.htm#fr_208.md) Madhu-sitthakena
sâretun ti madhu-sitthakena makkhetu*m* (B.).

<span id="fn_204"></span>[92:5](sbe20026.htm#fr_209.md) The use of this gum
for medicine purposes is allowed at Mahâvagga VI, 7, where see our note.
The present use is again mentioned below, V, 27, I.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[92:6](sbe20026.htm#fr_210.md) Sarita-sibbâ*t*ikan
ti madhu-sitthaka-pilotika*m* (B.).

<span id="fn_206"></span>[92:7](sbe20026.htm#fr_211.md) Vika*nn*a*m* hoti.
See the note on this expression at Mahâvagga VI, 21, I. The 'robes' were
lengths of cloth, and 'out of shape' (vika*nn*a*m*) must mean either
that one side was larger than the other, so that each corner (ka*nn*o)
was not a right angle, or perhaps that each edge (ka*nn*o) was not
straight.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[92:8](sbe20026.htm#fr_212.md) What Ka*th*ina may
meats in this connection is not exactly <span id="page_93">p. 93</span>
clear to us, but it is evidently a sort of framework, or bench, for the
tailors to lay out their work upon. Our notes above on the 1st
Nissaggiya and on Mahâvagga VII, 1, 3, refer to a different and
secondary use of the word in the Ka*th*ina ceremonies--so-called
doubtless because the Ka*th*ina-dussa (the supply of cloth to be dyed,
sewn, and made up into robes, and distributed, on one and the same day)
was to be so sewn with the aid of the Ka*th*ina here referred to.
Buddhaghosa says here, Ka*th*inan ti nisse*n*i pi tattha
attharita-ka*t*asâraka-kila*ñk*ana*m* a*ññ*atara*m* pi ka*th*ina*m*
vu*kk*ati yâya dupa*tt*a-*k*îvara*m* sibbenti ka*th*ine *k*îvara*m* pi
bandhanti. On Dupa*tt*a, see Mahâvagga VIII, 14, I.

The use of obandhitvâ (in reference to the Ka*th*ina), in opposition to
sambandhitvâ (in reference to the mere stakes), is worthy of notice.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[93:1](sbe20026.htm#fr_213.md) Paribhi*gg*ati.
Perhaps we should translate, 'did not hold together.' See the last
section.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[93:2](sbe20026.htm#fr_214.md) Anuvâta*m*
paribha*nd*a*m*. See Mahâvagga VII, 1, 5, VIII, 21, *K*ullavagga V, 9,
4, VI, 17, I, XI, I, 14, and our notes there.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[93:3](sbe20026.htm#fr_215.md) Ka*th*ina*m* na
ppahotî ti dîghassa bhikkhuno pamâ*n*ena kata*m* ka*th*ina*m* tattha
rassassa bhikkhuno *k*îvara*m* patthariyamâna*m* na ppahoti auto yeva
hoti (B.).

<span id="fn_211"></span>[94:1](sbe20026.htm#fr_217.md) On these terms,
which we do not attempt to translate, see Buddhaghosa's notes as quoted
by H.O. at p. 317 of the edition of the text. The first seems to be a
Ka*th*ina with a cross-bar, but da*nd*a at V, 11, 1, and V, 13, 3, means
handle.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[94:2](sbe20026.htm#fr_218.md)
Vinandhana-ra*gg*u*m* vinandhana-suttaka*m*. See Buddhaghosa's notes
loc. cit., and compare Mahâvagga V, 11.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[94:3](sbe20026.htm#fr_219.md) Visamâ honti ti
kâ*k*i khuddakâ honti kâ*k*i mahantâ (B.). Sutta here probably means
those threads or strings just referred to by which the stuff was to be
tied on to the Ka*th*ina.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[94:4](sbe20026.htm#fr_220.md) Ka*li*mbhaka*m*: so
explained by Buddhaghosa, loc. cit.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[94:5](sbe20026.htm#fr_221.md) Mogha-suttaka*m*.
Buddhaghosa says, 'the making of a mark with a green thread, as
carpenters do on wood with a black thread.' Compare also our notes 2 and
3 on Mahâvagga VII, 1, 5.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[94:6](sbe20026.htm#fr_222.md) The whole section
is repeated in the text at length for each of these three cases.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[95:1](sbe20026.htm#fr_223.md) Pa*t*iggaho,
'receptacle' for the finger. See our note above on V, 10, 3, where the
same word means a waste-tub. For other secondary uses of the word, see
*G*âtaka I, 146, II, 9, 26. Buddhaghosa says here, pa*t*iggahan ti
aṅguli-kosaka*m*.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[95:2](sbe20026.htm#fr_224.md) So of
ointment-boxes, Mahâvagga VII, 12, 1; and of scissors, above, V, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[95:3](sbe20026.htm#fr_225.md)
Âsevana-(sic)vitthaka*m* nâma ya*m* ki*ñk*i pâtîi-*k*aṅgo*t*akâdi (B.).

<span id="fn_220"></span>[96:1](sbe20026.htm#fr_226.md) See our note above
on V, 9, 4.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[96:2](sbe20026.htm#fr_227.md) The whole of this
paragraph is repeated below, though not in the same order, of the
*K*aṅkama or cloister, and of the *G*antâghara, or bath-house. (See V,
14, 2, 3.)

<span id="fn_222"></span>[96:3](sbe20026.htm#fr_228.md) That is, to build
it on a raised platform, the technical term for which is *k*aya.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[96:4](sbe20026.htm#fr_229.md) See our note below
on V, 14, 3. The whole passage recurs of the lining of a well at V, 16,
2, and of Vihâras themselves at VI, 3, 3.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[96:5](sbe20026.htm#fr_230.md) Âlambana-bâha*m*.
At Mahâ-sudassana Sutta I, 59, there is <span id="page_97">p. 97</span>
a description of flights of stairs (sopânâ), each of which had thambhâ,
evidently posts or banisters; sû*k*iyo, apparently cross-bars let in to
these banisters; and u*n*hîsa*m*, either a head-line running along the
top of the banisters, or a figure-head at the lower end of such a
head-line. (See Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 262.) This and the
previous paragraphs are repeated below, V, 14, 2, of the *K*aṅkama.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[97:1](sbe20026.htm#fr_231.md) See Mahâvagga V,
11, where the same technical term (ogumpheti) is used. Buddhaghosa's
note is given at p. 317 of the text. See also V, 14, 3, below.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[97:2](sbe20026.htm#fr_232.md)
Geruka-parikamma*m*. This reading, and not gerika, is confirmed by VI,
3, 1, VI, 17, 1, where the two previous words also occur. On this mode
of preparing walls and floors, see our note below on VI, 20.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[97:3](sbe20026.htm#fr_233.md) Pa*ñk*a-pa*t*ika*m*
or -pa*tth*ika*m*, a term of doubtful signification which recurs,
together with all the previous words, in the Old Commentary on the 19th
Pâ*k*ittiya. Compare pa*ñk*a-prastha in B*R*. The word is perhaps
however connected with Sanskrit pa*tt*ikâ, as *k*ela-pattikam at V, 21,
2 undoubtedly is. It occurs below, in a similar connection, at VI, 3, 1.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[98:1](sbe20026.htm#fr_234.md) Go-gha*m*sikâya.
Compare pâda-gha*m*sani at 22. 1; and on the use of sa*m*harati in a
similar connection, see VI, 2, 7.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[98:2](sbe20026.htm#fr_235.md) Nâga-dante. See the
note on Mallaka at *K*ullavagga V, I, 4.
