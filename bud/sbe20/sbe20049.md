### 34.

1\. Now at that time the Blessed One when, surrounded by a great
assembly, he was preaching the Dhamma, was seated. And a certain
Bhikkhu, who had eaten onions, sat down apart, thinking, Let not the
Bhikkhus be annoyed  <span id="fr_423"></span>[3](#fn_415.md)!'

The Blessed One saw that Bhikkhu sitting apart; and on seeing him, he
said to the Bhikkhus, 'Why now, O Bhikkhus, is that Bhikkhu seated
apart?'

'This Bhikkhu, Lord, has eaten onions, and has

seated himself apart in order not to annoy the Bhikkhus.'

'But ought, O Bhikkhus, anything to be eaten, that will cause the eater
to keep away from such a preaching of the Dhamma as this?'

'No, indeed, Lord.'

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to eat onions. Whosoever does so, shall be
guilty of a dukka*t*a <span

2\. Now at that time the venerable Sâriputta had wind in his stomach.
And the venerable Mahâ Moggallâna went up to the place where the
venerable Sâriputta was, and when he had come there, he said to the
venerable Sâriputta:

'How did you formerly, friend Sâriputta, get relief, when you had wind
in the stomach?'

'By eating onions, my friend <span

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to eat onions on account of disease.'
