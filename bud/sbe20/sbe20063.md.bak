### 11 <span id="fr_580"></span>[2](#fn_570.md).

1\. Now at that time the Sattarasa-vaggiya Bhikkhus made ready a certain
large Vihâra in the neighbourhood <span id="fr_581"></span>[3](#fn_571.md),
with the intention of dwelling in it. And when the *Kh*abbaggiya
Bhikkhus saw what they were doing, they said: 'These venerable ones, the
Sattarasa-vaggiya Bhikkhus, are

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

getting a Vihâra ready; come, let us turn them out.' Some of them said:
'Let us stay here <span id="fr_582"></span>[1](#fn_572.md) whilst they get
it ready, and turn them out when it is prepared.' So the *Kh*abbaggiya
Bhikkhus said to the Sattarasa-vaggiyas: 'Depart, Sirs; the Vihâra has
fallen unto us.'

'Why did you not, Sirs, say so sooner; and we would have got some other
one ready?'

Is not, then, this Vihâra the common property of the Sa*m*gha?'

Yes, Sirs; that is so.'

'Then depart, Sirs; for the Vihâra has fallen unto us.'

It is large, Sirs, this Vihâra. You can dwell in it, and we as well.'

Then, full of anger and displeasure, they repeated, 'Depart, Sirs; this
Vihâra has fallen unto us.' And seizing them by the throat, they cast
them out. And the others, being ejected, wept.

The Bhikkhus asked, 'Why, Sirs, do you weep?'

Then they told them; and the moderate Bhikkhus murmured, &c., and told
the matter to the Blessed One.

'Is it true, as they say, &c.?'

'It is true, Lord.'

Then he rebuked them; and when he had delivered a religious discourse,
he said to the Bhikkhus:

'A Bhikkhu is not, O Bhikkhus, to be cast out of a Vihâra, the common
property of the Sa*m*gha, in anger and vexation. Whosoever does so,
shall

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

be dealt with according to the law <span
id="fr_583"></span>[1](#fn_573.md). I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to allot the
lodging-places (common to the Sa*m*gha to those who have need of
them) <span id="fr_584"></span>[2](#fn_574.md).'

2\. Now the Bhikkhus thought, 'How then shall the lodging-places be
allotted?'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to appoint as an apportioner of lodging places
a Bhikkhu possessed of these five qualifications--one who does not walk
in partiality, who does not walk in malice, who does not walk in
stupidity, who does not walk in fear (and so on, as in Khandhaka IV
chapter 10, down to the end of the Kammavâ*k*â).'

3\. Now the apportioners of lodging-places thought, 'How then ought the
lodging-places to be apportioned?'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, in the first place to count the Bhikkhus, then
to count the sleeping-places, then to apportion accordingly <span
id="fr_585"></span>[3](#fn_575.md).'

When apportioning according to the number of sleeping-places, some
remained unallotted <span id="fr_586"></span>[4](#fn_576.md).

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to apportion according to the number of
apartments (Vihâras):

When so apportioning, some apartments(Vihâras) remained unallotted.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to apportion according to the number of
buildings (Parive*n*as) <span id="fr_587"></span>[1](#fn_577.md).'

When so apportioning, some buildings (Parive*n*as) remained unallotted.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to give a supplementary share to each
Bhikkhu <span id="fr_588"></span>[2](#fn_578.md).'

When more than one share had been allotted, another Bhikkhu arrived.

'In that case a share need not be allotted to him, if the Bhikkhus do
not wish to do so <span id="fr_589"></span>[3](#fn_579.md).'

Now at that time they allotted sleeping-places to a Bhikkhu who was then
staying outside the boundary (of the district in which the building was
situate) <span id="fr_590"></span>[4](#fn_580.md).

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to \[do so\]. Whosoever does so, shall be
guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus, after the lodging-places had been
allotted, kept them to the exclusion of others for all time.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to do so. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty
of a dukka*t*a. I allow you to retain them for the three months of the
rainy, but not for the dry season.'

4\. Then the Bhikkhus thought, 'What is (it now that constitutes) an
allotment of lodging-places?'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'There are these three allotments of lodging-places, O Bhikkhus,--the
earlier, the later, and the intermediate. The earlier is to be held on
the day after the full moon of Âsâ*lh*a (June-July); the later, a month
after that full moon <span id="fr_591"></span>[1](#fn_581.md); the
intermediate (literally that which involves a giving up during the
intervening time) is held on the day after the Pavâra*n*â ceremony, with
reference to the rainy season of the following year. These, O Bhikkhus,
are the three allotments of lodging-places.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_570"></span>[200:2](sbe20063.htm#fr_580.md) The story in this
section forms also the introductory story to the 17th Pâ*k*ittiya.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[200:3](sbe20063.htm#fr_581.md) Pa*kk*antima*m*;
perhaps 'in the border-country.' Compare pa*kk*anta*m* nagara*m*, a
frontier fort at Dhammapada, p. 56.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[201:1](sbe20063.htm#fr_582.md) Âgametha yâva.
Compare the introductory story to the 46th Pâ*k*ittiya.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[202:1](sbe20063.htm#fr_583.md) That is, under the
17th Pâ*k*ittiya.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[202:2](sbe20063.htm#fr_584.md) Senâsanam
gâhetu*m*. Buddhaghosa has nothing on this idiom, but its meaning is
sufficiently clear from the connection.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[202:3](sbe20063.htm#fr_585.md) Seyyaggena
gâhetu*m*. Buddhaghosa has no special explanation of agga here, but in
his explanation of the passage says that this is to be so done that each
Bhikkhu receives room for a couch (ma*ñk*a*tth*ana*m*). Agga must here
be agra, to which Böhtlingk-Roth give, from Indian lexicographers, the
subsidiary meaning of 'multitude.' So below in XII, 1, 1, the
Va*gg*iputtakas divide money amongst themselves bhikkhu-aggena,
'according to the number of the Bhikkhus.' Seyyâ is here used in the
same meaning as that in which senâsana is used throughout the rest of
this chapter and the next. See VIII, 1, 4.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[202:4](sbe20063.htm#fr_586.md) Ussâdiyi*m*su.
Buddhaghosa says ussârayi*m*sû ti ma*ñk*a*tth*ânâni <span
id="page_203">p. 203</span> atirekâni ahesu*m*. His reading is in a copy
of his work in Burmese characters, and is supported, both here and in
Pâ*k*ittiya XLVI, 2, where the word recurs, by a Burmese copy of the
text. The Sinhalese reading is the correct one, but one may compare the
idiom *g*ana*m*, or parisa*m*, ussâreti at Mahâvagga VIII, 1, 22, and
*G*âtaka I, 419, 434. So at IX, I, 3, 4, the reading ussâreti given in
the text is corrected at p. 363 into ussâdeti, in accordance with the
reading of the Sinhalese MS.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[203:1](sbe20063.htm#fr_587.md) The relation of
the Vihâra to the Parive*n*a is here curious. In the later language
parive*n*a means 'cells.' Here it evidently includes several vihâras.

<span id="fn_578"></span>[203:2](sbe20063.htm#fr_588.md) Anubhâgan ti puna
apara*m* pi bhâga*m* dâtu*m* (B.).

<span id="fn_579"></span>[203:3](sbe20063.htm#fr_589.md) Na akâmâ is used
here in a sense precisely parallel to that in which it occurs at
Mahâvagga VII, 24, 4. See the passages quoted in our note there.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[203:4](sbe20063.htm#fr_590.md) Nissîme
*th*itassa. See on this phrase above, Mahâvagga VII, I, 5, and VIII, 2,
3. It is repeated below, VI, 17, 2.

<span id="fn_581"></span>[204:1](sbe20063.htm#fr_591.md) These first two
dates are the days on which the earlier and the later Vassa begins. See
Mahâvagga III, 2.
