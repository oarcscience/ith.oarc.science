### 27.

1\. Now at that time Bhikkhunîs, fearing to offend, would not let men
salute them, or cut their hair or nails, or dress their wounds.

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow them, O Bhikkhus, to permit those things.'

2\. Now at that time Bhikkhunîs, when sitting on a divan, allowed (other
people thereon) to touch them with their heels.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to sit on a divan <span
id="fr_958"></span>[1](#fn_942.md). Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a
dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhunî was sick, and without using a divan
she could not be at ease.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow Bhikkhunîs, O Bhikkhus, to use a half-divan <span
id="fr_959"></span>[2](#fn_943.md).'

3\. \[Rule as to construction of privies <span
id="fr_960"></span>[3](#fn_944.md).\]

4\. Now at that time the Bhikkhunîs used chunam at their baths.

People murmured, saying, 'As the women in the world do!'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to use chunam at her bath. Whosoever
does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of
clay and the red powder of rice husks <span
id="fr_961"></span>[4](#fn_945.md).'

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

\[Similar paragraph, ending\]

'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to use scented clay at her bath <span
id="fr_962"></span>[1](#fn_946.md). Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a
dukka*t*a. I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of common clay.'

Now at that time Bhikkhunîs bathing together in the steam-bath room made
a tumult.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'Bhikkhunîs are not, O Bhikkhus, to bathe in a steam-bath. Whosoever
does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time Bhikkhunîs bathing against the stream allowed the rush
of water against them.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to bathe against the stream. Whosoever
does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time Bhikkhunîs bathed in a place not a common
bathing-place, and men of abandoned life violated them.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to bathe at a place not a common
bathing-place. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time Bhikkhunîs bathed at a bathing-place used also by men.
People murmured, were indignant, and complained, saying, 'As those women
do who are still living in the pleasures of the world <span
id="fr_963"></span>[1](#fn_946.md).'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to bathe at a bathing-place used also
by men. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I allow,
Bhikkhunîs, O Bhikkhus, to bathe at a bathing-place used by women.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_942"></span>[367:1](sbe20118.htm#fr_958.md) Pallaṅka*m*.
Compare Mahâvagga V, 10, 4, 5; *K*ullavagga V, 37, VI, 8, VI, 14; and
the 42nd Bhikkhunî Pâ*k*ittiya.

<span id="fn_943"></span>[367:2](sbe20118.htm#fr_959.md)
A*ddh*a-pallaṅka*m*. Probably a cushion, which only one person could use
at a time.

<span id="fn_944"></span>[367:3](sbe20118.htm#fr_960.md) Compare the Rules
for the Bhikkhus, *K*ullavagga VIII, q, 10, which we have also left
untranslated. Buddhaghosa says here, He*tth*â-viva*t*e upari*kkh*anne ti
ettha sa*k*e kûpo khato hoti upari pana padaramattam eva sabba-disâsu
pa*ññ*âyati evarûpe pi va*tt*ati.

<span id="fn_945"></span>[367:4](sbe20118.htm#fr_961.md) Kukkusa*m*.
Buddhaghosa says here, Kukkusa*m* mattikan <span id="page_368">p.
368</span> ti ku*nd*aka*ñ* *k*’ eva mattika*ñ* *k*a. The use of these
last two was allowed to Bhikkhus by *K*ullavagga VI, 3, I, for building
purposes.

<span id="fn_946"></span>[368:1](sbe20118.htm#fr_963.md) This is apparently
covered by the 88th and 89th Bhikkhunî Pâ*k*ittiya.
