### 10.

1\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus went on their round for alms, carrying
water jugs made out of gourds <span id="fr_193"></span>[2](#fn_188.md), or
water-pots <span id="fr_194"></span>[3](#fn_189.md).

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

People murmured, were shocked, and indignant, saying, 'As the Titthiyas
do.'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to go on your rounds for alms with water jugs,
or pots. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

2\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu, who had taken upon himself a vow
to wear or use nothing except what he could procure from dust-heaps or
cemeteries, went on his rounds for alms carrying a bowl made out of a
skull. A certain woman saw him, and was afraid, and made an outcry <span
id="fr_195"></span>[1](#fn_190.md), saying, 'O horror! This is surely a
devil!'

People murmured, were shocked, and indignant, saying, 'How can the
Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as carry about bowls made out of skulls, as the
devil-worshippers <span id="fr_196"></span>[2](#fn_191.md) do?'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to use bowls made out of skulls. Whosoever
does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. And you are not, O Bhikkhus, to
take a vow to wear or to use nothing except what you procure from
dust-heaps or cemeteries. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a
dukka*t*a.'

3\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus carried out odd bits, and bones, and
dirty water <span id="fr_197"></span>[3](#fn_192.md) in their bowls.

People murmured, were shocked, and were indignant, saying, 'The very
vessel out of which

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

these Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as eat, that they use as a waste-tub!'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to carry out odd bits, and bones, and dirty
water in your bowls. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.
I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a waste-tub <span
id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_193.md).'
