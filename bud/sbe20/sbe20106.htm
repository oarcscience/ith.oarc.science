<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'A Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, is not to give away to others what was given for them themselves to have. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>

<p>'I allow food that has been stored up to be enjoyed by the Bhikkhun&icirc;s after they have had it given over to them by the Bhikkhus.'</p>
