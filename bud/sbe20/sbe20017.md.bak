### 2.

1\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

used to wear ear-rings <span id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_130.md), and
ear-drops <span id="fr_135"></span>[2](#fn_131.md), and strings of beads
for the throat, and girdles of beads <span
id="fr_136"></span>[3](#fn_132.md), and bangles <span
id="fr_137"></span>[4](#fn_133.md), and necklaces <span
id="fr_138"></span>[5](#fn_134.md), and bracelets, and rings.

The people murmured, &c. . . . . The Bhikkhus heard, &c. . . . . They
told the, Blessed One (&c., as in II, 1, 1, down to) he addressed the
Bhikkhus, and said:

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to wear any of these things. Whosoever does
so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

2\. \[A similar paragraph concluding\]

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to wear long hair. Whosoever does so, shall be
guilty of a dukka*t*a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, hair that is two months
old, or two inches long.'

3\. \[Similar paragraph concluding\]

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to smooth <span
id="fr_139"></span>[6](#fn_135.md) the hair

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

with a comb, or with a smoothing instrument shaped like a snake's
hood <span id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_136.md), or with the hand used as
such an instrument <span id="fr_141"></span>[2](#fn_137.md), or with
pomade <span id="fr_142"></span>[3](#fn_138.md), or with hair-oil of
beeswax <span id="fr_143"></span>[3](#fn_138.md). Whosoever does so, shall
be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

4\. \[Similar paragraph concluding\]

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to look at the image of your faces in a
looking-glass, or a bowl of water <span id="fr_144"></span>[4](#fn_139.md).
Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had a sore in his face. He asked the
Bhikkhus what kind of a sore he had. 'Such and such a kind of sore,'
replied they. He did not believe what they said. They told this matter
to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, on account of a disease, to look at your faces
in a looking-glass, or in a bowl of water.'

5\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus (&c., down to)

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to anoint your faces, nor to rub (ointment,
&c.) into your faces, nor to put chunam on your faces, nor to smear red
arsenic on your faces, nor to paint your bodies, nor to paint your
faces <span id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_140.md).'

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had disease in his eyes. They told
the matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, on account of disease, to anoint your faces.'

6 <span id="fr_146"></span>[2](#fn_141.md). Now at that time there was a
festival on the mountain-top <span id="fr_147"></span>[3](#fn_142.md) at
Râ*g*agaha; and the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus went to see it.

The people murmured, were annoyed, and became indignant, saying, 'How
can the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as go to see dancing, and singing, and
music, like those who are still enjoying the pleasures of the world?'
And they told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to go to see dancing, or singing, or music.
Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_130"></span>[69:1](sbe20017.htm#fr_134.md) Vallikâ ti
ka*nn*ato nikkhanta-mutt-olambakâdîna*m* eta*m* adhiva*k*ana*m*. Na
kevala*ñ* *k*a vallikâ eva, ya*m* ki*ñk*i ka*nn*a-pilandhana*m* antamaso
tâla-panna*m* pi na va*tt*ati (B.). Compare satavallika*m* at V, 29, 4.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[69:2](sbe20017.htm#fr_135.md) Pâmaṅga. The
meaning of which is not clear from Buddhaghosa's note loc. cit. It
occurs also at Dîpava*m*sa XII, 1, and below in Buddhaghosa's note on
maddavi*n*a at V, 29, 2 (twice).

<span id="fn_132"></span>[69:3](sbe20017.htm#fr_136.md) Ka*t*i-suttaka*m*.
This is not mentioned in the similar paragraph at V, 29, 2, where all
special kinds of girdles are enumerated. It is forbidden below to the
Bhikkhunîs at X, 16.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[69:4](sbe20017.htm#fr_137.md) Ova*tt*ika. This
word is explained by Buddhaghosa as the same as valaya*m*. Ova*tt*iya
occurs, apparently in a different sense, at Mahâvagga VII, 1, 5, and the
present word in Buddhaghosa on sata-vallika*m* at V, 29, 4.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[69:5](sbe20017.htm#fr_138.md) Kâyura, on which
Buddhaghosa, loc. cit., merely says that the meaning of this, and of the
following words, is evident. But the *G*âtaka commentary (Fausböll III,
437, 14) says kâyûan ti gîvâya pilandhana-pasâdhana*m*.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[69:6](sbe20017.htm#fr_139.md) Osa*n*heti. Compare
the Sanskrit *s*laksh*n*ayati. The art of hair-dressing had, at the time
when the *K*ullavagga was composed, been already carried to a high state
of efficiency in the valley of the Ganges, as may reasonably be
concluded from the numerous kinds of headdresses figured in bas-relief
on some of the oldest Buddhist sculptures.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[70:1](sbe20017.htm#fr_140.md) Pha*n*akenâ ti
dantamayâdisu yena kena*k*i (B.).

<span id="fn_137"></span>[70:2](sbe20017.htm#fr_141.md) Hattha-pha*n*akenâ
ti hatthen’ eva pha*n*aka-ki*kk*a*m* karonti, aṅgulîhi osa*n*henti (B.).
It is clear from this last explanation that the pha*n*aka was a kind of
very primitive brush, but without bristles. In passing the fingers
through the hair the fingers are naturally held separate, slightly
forward, and stiff--precisely as one would hold them if one wished to
imitate the hood of a cobra. To make a real brush with bristles was
evidently beyond the mechanical appliances of those times, or such an
article would certainly have been mentioned in this connection.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[70:3](sbe20017.htm#fr_143.md) On the use of
Telaka, compare Mahâvagga VI, 13, I, and Sittha-telaka at *K*ullavagga
IV, 3, 1.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[70:4](sbe20017.htm#fr_144.md) Compare
*K*ullavagga X, 10, 4.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[71:1](sbe20017.htm#fr_145.md) All these practices
are seriatim forbidden to the Bhikkhunîs also in *K*ullavagga X, 10, 3.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[71:2](sbe20017.htm#fr_146.md) The following
section recurs, almost word for word, of the Bhikkhunîs, in the
Bhikkhunî-vibhaṅga, Pâ*k*ittiya X (Sutta-vibhaṅga, vol. ii, p. 267).

<span id="fn_142"></span>[71:3](sbe20017.htm#fr_147.md) Giragga-sama*gg*a.
Compare Dîpava*m*sa XXI, 32, and Mahâva*m*sa, p. 214, line 2. It occurs
also in the Introductory Story in the Sutta-vibhaṅga on the 37th
Pâ*k*ittiya, and Buddhaghosa there explains it as follows:
Giragga-sama*gg*o ti girimhi agga-sama*gg*o girissa vâ agga-dese
sama*gg*o. He is evidently in doubt about the word, which is probably
connected with ancient local worship or custom, a worship in
high-places, as little allied to Vedic Brahmanism as it was to Buddhism.
