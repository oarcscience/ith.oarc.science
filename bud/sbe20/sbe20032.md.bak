### 17.

1\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus used to bathe anywhere all over the
Ârâma, and the Ârâma became muddy.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, a pool (at the entrance to the Ârâma).'

The pool was public, and the Bhikkhus were ashamed to bathe in it.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to surround it with enclosures of three
kinds--brick walls, stone walls, and wooden fences <span
id="fr_300"></span>[1](#fn_294.md).'

The pool became muddy.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to flag it with three kinds of flooring--brick
flooring, stone flooring, or wooden flooring.'

The water settled.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, a drain.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus' limbs became cold.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make use of a towel <span
id="fr_301"></span>[2](#fn_295.md), and to wipe the water off with a
cloth.'

2\. Now at that time a certain Upâsaka was desirous of making a tank for
the use of the Sa*m*gha.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, a tank.'

The sides of the tank fell in <span id="fr_302"></span>[3](#fn_296.md).

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to line the tank with facing of three
kinds--brick facing, stone facing, and wooden facing.'

They found difficulty <span id="fr_303"></span>[1](#fn_297.md) in getting
into it.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, flights of stairs of three kinds--brick steps,
stone steps, and wooden steps.'

While going up them, they fell down.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, a balustrade.'

The water in the tank became stale.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of pipes to lay on the water <span
id="fr_304"></span>[2](#fn_298.md), and to drain the water off <span
id="fr_305"></span>[3](#fn_299.md).'

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu was desirous of erecting a bath-room
with a nillekha <span id="fr_306"></span>[4](#fn_300.md) roof for the use
of the Sa*m*gha.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, a bath-room with such a roof to it.'
