### 2.

1\. Now the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'Now
henceforth I, O Bhikkhus, will not hold Uposatha, nor recite the
Pâtimokkha; let you yourselves, O Bhikkhus, henceforth hold Uposatha and
recite the Pâtimokkha. It is, O Bhikkhus, an impossible thing and an
inexpedient that the Tathâgata should hold Uposatha and recite the
Pâtimokkha before an assembly which is not pure. And the Pâtimokkha, O
Bhikkhus, is not to be listened to by one who has committed an offence.
Whosoever shall so listen to it, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I allow
you, O Bhikkhus, for whomsoever shall listen to the Pâtimokkha at a time
when he is guilty, to interdict for him the Pâtimokkha <span

'And thus, O Bhikkhus, is it to be interdicted. On the day of Uposatha,
on the fourteenth or fifteenth day of the month, and at a time when that
individual is present, thus shall it be proposed in the midst of the
Sa*m*gha:

'"Let the venerable Sa*m*gha hear me. Such and such an individual is
guilty of an offence. For him

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

do I interdict the Pâtimokkha to the effect that it shall not be recited
when he is present. The Pâtimokkha is accordingly interdicted."'

*th*apetu*m*: exactly analogous to pavâra*n*a*m* *th*apetu*m* at
Mahâvagga IV, 16, 2. H.O. has already pointed out (in his 'Buddha,' p.
381, note 2) that we have evidently here a later innovation. The whole
frame of the Pâtimokkha shows that it was at first intended that a
guilty Bhikkhu should confess his offence during the recitation, if he
had not done so before,
