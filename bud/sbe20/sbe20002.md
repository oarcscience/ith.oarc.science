# *K*ULLAVAGGA.

## FOURTH KHANDHAKA.

#### THE SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES AMONG THE FRATERNITY.

### 1.

1\. Now at that time the Blessed Buddha was dwelling at Sâvatthi, in the
Ârâma of Anâthapi*nd*ika. And at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus
used to carry out the formal Acts--the Ta*gg*aniya, and the Nissaya, and
the Pabbâ*g*aniya, and the Pa*t*isâra*n*iya, and the
Ukkhepaniya--against Bhikkhus who were not present.

Then those Bhikkhus who were modest were annoyed, murmured, and became
indignant, saying, 'How can the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus \[act
thus\] <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)?' And those Bhikkhus told the
matter to the Blessed One.

'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, as they say, that the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus
carry out the (aforesaid) <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) formal Acts
against Bhikkhus who are not present?'

'It is true, Lord!'

The Blessed Buddha rebuked them, saying, 'This is improper (&c., as in
I, 1, 2, down to the end).' And when he had thus rebuked them, and had

delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:
'The formal Acts, O Bhikkhus, the Ta*gg*aniya-, the Nissaya-, the
Pabbâ*g*aniya-, the Pa*t*isâra*n*iya-, and the Ukkhepaniya-kammas, ought
not to be carried out against Bhikkhus who are not present. Whosoever
does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a offence.'
