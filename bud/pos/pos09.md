## <span id="C-IV">CANTO IV PSALMS OF FOUR VERSES</span>

### <span id="XXXVII">XXXVII Bhaddā of the Kapilas.</span> [<sup>184</sup>](pos09.htm#47-1)

N<span class="small">OW</span> she was born in the time of Padumuttara
Buddha, in a clansman's house at Haŋsavatī. Come to years of discretion,
she heard the Master preach, and saw him assign a Bhikkhunī the first
rank among those who could recall previous lives. Thereat she made her
resolve, wishing that she, too, might acquire such a rank. Working merit
all her life, she was reborn, when no Buddha had arisen, in a clansman's
house at Benares, and in due course married.

Then one day a quarrel arose between her and her sister-in-law. And the
latter having given food to a Silent Buddha, Bhaddā thought, 'She will
win glory for this,' and taking the bowl from his hand, she filled it
with mud instead of food. The people said, 'Foolish woman! what has the
Silent Buddha done to offend you?' And she, ashamed of herself, took
back the bowl, emptied and scrubbed it with scented powder, filled it
with the four sweet foods, and sprinkled it on the top with ghee of the
colour of a lotus-calyx. Handing it back, shining, to the Silent Buddha,
she registered a prayer: 'May I have a shining body like this bowl!'

After many fortunate rebirths, she was reborn, in the time of Kassapa
Buddha, at Benares, as the daughter of the wealthy treasurer. But by the
fruition of her previous karma her body was of evil odour, and she was
repulsive to others. Much troubled thereby, she had her ornaments made
into an ingot of gold, and placed it in the Buddha's shrine, doing
reverence with her hands full of lotuses. Thereby her body, even in that
birth, became fragrant and sweet. As a beloved wife she did good all her
life, was reborn in heaven to celestial joys, and at length took birth
as the daughter of the King of Benares. There she lived gloriously,
ministering to Silent Buddhas. When they passed away she was greatly
troubled, and left the world for ascetic practices. Dwelling in groves,
she practised Jhana, and was reborn in the Brahma heavens, and thence
into the family of a brahmin of the Kosiya clan at
Sāgala.[<sup>185</sup>](pos09.htm#48-1) Reared in great state, she was
wedded to the young noble Pippali at the village of Mahā-tittha. When he
renounced the world she handed over her great wealth to her kinsfolk
that she too might go forth; and she dwelt five years in the Sophists'
Grove,[<sup>186</sup>](pos09.htm#48-2) after which she was ordained by
Great Pajāpatī the Gotamid. Establishing insight, she soon won
Arahantship.

And she became an expert in knowledge of her past lives, through the
surplus force of her resolve (made in past ages), and was herein ranked
first by the Master when, seated in the Jeta Grove among the company of
Ariyans,[<sup>187</sup>](pos09.htm#48-3) he classified the Bhikkhunīs.
One day she broke forth in a Psalm, recounting all that she had wrought,
accompanied by a eulogy of the virtues of the great Elder Kassapa,
[<sup>188</sup>](pos09.htm#49-1) thus:

Bears to this end her last incarnate frame,<br />
For she hath conquered Mara and his host. (65)</span><br />

We both have seen, both he and I, the woe<br />

> <sup>184</sup> Dr. Neumann translates Kapilāni by 'the Blonde'
> (*kapilo* is auburn, reddish), as if in keeping with the soubriquet of
> the other Bhaddā ([Ps. xlvi.](pos10.htm#XLVI)). I have not done so
> because elsewhere a soubriquet is always explicitly accounted for in
> the Commentary, and here nothing is said. Moreover, and this is fairly
> conclusive, the Apadãna chronicle, quoted in the Commentary, makes
> Bhaddā 'daughter of Kapilā the twice-born (brahmin).' Kapilānī,
> therefore, refers to her family. and should be Kāpilānī. The Phayre
> and Paris MSS. of the Therīgāthā both read Kāpilāni, so does *Vin.*,
> iv., 290, 292.

> <sup>188</sup> Mahā-Kassapa became the leader of the Buddhist Order
