## <span id="C-XIII">CANTO XIII PSALMS OF ABOUT TWENTY VERSES</span>

### <span id="LXVI">LXVI Ambapālī.</span>

S<span class="small">HE</span>, too, having made her resolve under
former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this or
that rebirth, entered the Order when Sikhi was Buddha. And one day,
while yet a novice, she was walking in procession with Bhikkhunīs, doing
homage at a shrine, when an Arahant Therī in front of her hastily spat
in the court of the shrine. Coming after her, but not having noticed the
Therī's action, she said in reproof: 'What prostitute has been spitting
in this place?'

As a Bhikkhunī, observing the Precepts, she felt repugnance for rebirth
by parentage, and set her mind intently on spontaneous re-generation. So
in her last birth she came into being spontaneously at Vesālī, in the
King's gardens, at the foot of a mango-tree. The gardener found her, and
brought her to the city. She was known as the Mango-guardian's girl. And
such was her beauty, grace, and charm that many young Princes strove
with each other to possess her, till, in order to end their strife, and
because the power of karma impelled them, they agreed to appoint her
courtezan. Later on, out of faith in the Master, she built a Vihāra
[<sup>337</sup>](pos18.htm#120-1.md) in her own gardens, and handed it over
to him and the Order. And when she had heard her own son, the Elder
Vimala-Kondañña, preach the Norm, she worked for insight, and studying
the law of impermanence as illustrated in her own ageing body, she
uttered the following verses:

And inasmuch as the Therī, by the visible signs of impermanence in her
own person, discerned impermanence in all phenomena of the three planes,
and bearing that in mind, brought into relief the signs of Ill and of
No-soul, she, making clear her insight in her Path-progress, attained
Arahantship.

### <span id="LXVII">LXVII Rohiṇī.</span>

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up
good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, was born,
ninety-one æons ago, in the time of Vipassi Buddha, in a clansman's
family. One day she saw the Exalted One seeking alms in the city of
Bandhumatī, and filling his bowl with sweet cakes, she worshipped low at
his feet in joy and gladness. And when, after many rebirths in heaven
and on earth in consequence thereof, she had accumulated the conditions
requisite for emancipation, she was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at
Vesālī, in the house of a very prosperous brahmin, and named Rohiṇī.
[<sup>345</sup>](pos18.htm#125-1.md) Come to years of discretion, she went,
while the Master was staying at Vesālī, to the Vihāra, and heard the
doctrine. She became a 'Stream-entrant,' and teaching her parents the
doctrine, and they accepting it, she gained their leave to enter the
Order. Studying for insight, she not long after attained Arahantship,
together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and meaning.

And reflecting on a discussion she had had with her father while she had
yet only entered the Stream, she uttered the substance of it as verses
of exultation:

For the brahmin, established in the Refuges and the Precepts, when later
on he became alarmed, renounced the world, and, developing insight, was
established in Arahantship. Reflecting on his attainment, he exulted in
that last verse.

### <span id="LXVIII">LXVIII Cāpā.</span>

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up
good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, till she had
accumulated the sources of good, and matured the conditions for
emancipation, was, in this Buddha-age, reborn in the Vankahāra country,
at a certain village of trappers, as the daughter of the chief trapper,
and named Cāpā. [<sup>351</sup>](pos18.htm#129-1.md) And at that time
Upaka, an ascetic, [<sup>352</sup>](pos18.htm#129-2.md) met the Master as
he was going to Benares, there to set rolling from his Bo-tree throne
[<sup>353</sup>](pos18.htm#129-3.md) the Wheel of the Norm, and asked him:
'You seem, my friend, in perfect health! Clear and pure is your
complexion. Wherefore have you, friend, left the world? or who may your
teacher be? or whose doctrine do you believe in?' And he was thus
answered:

> 'All have I overcome. All things I know,  
> 'Mid all things undefiled. Renouncing all,  
> In death of Craving wholly free. My own  
> The Deeper View. Whom should I name to thee?  
> For me no teacher lives. I stand alone  
> On earth, in heav'n rival to me there's none.  
>   
> Now go I on seeking Benares town,  
> To start the Wheel, the gospel of the Norm,  
> To rouse and guide the nations blind and lost,  
> Striking Salvation's drum, Ambrosia's alarm.'

The ascetic, discerning the omniscience and great mission of the Master,
was comforted in mind, and replied: 'Friend, may these things be! Thou
art worthy [<sup>354</sup>](pos18.htm#130-1.md) to be a conqueror, world
without end!' Then, taking a by-road, he came to the Vankahāra country,
and abode near the hamlet of the trappers, where the head trapper
supplied his wants. One day the latter, setting off on a long hunt with
sons and brothers, bade his daughter not neglect 'the Arahant'
[<sup>355</sup>](pos18.htm#130-2.md) in his absence. Now, she was of great
beauty; and Upaka, seeking alms at her home, and captivated by her
beauty, could not eat, but took his food home, and laid down fasting,
vowing he would die should he not win Cāpā. After seven days the father
returned, and, on inquiring for his 'Arahant,' heard he had not come
again after the first day. The trapper sought him, and Upaka, moaning,
and rolling over, confessed his plight. The trapper asked if he knew any
craft, and he answered, 'No;' but offered to fetch their game and sell
it. The trapper consented, and, giving him a coat, brought him to his
own home, and gave him his daughter. In due time she had a son, whom
they called Subhadda. [<sup>356</sup>](pos18.htm#130-3.md) Cāpā, when the
baby cried, sang to him: 'Upaka's boy, ascetic's boy, game-dealer's boy,
don't cry, don't cry!' mocking her husband. And he said at length: 'Do
not thou, Cāpā, fancy I have none to protect me.
[<sup>357</sup>](pos18.htm#130-4.md) I have a friend, even a conqueror
eternal, and to him I will go.' She saw that he was vexed, and teased
him again and again in the same way, till one day, in anger, he got
ready to go. She said much, but vainly, to prevent him, and he set out
*westward*. And the Exalted One was then at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove,
and announced this to the brethren: 'He who to-day shall come asking,
"Where is the Conqueror eternal?" send him to me.' And Upaka arrived,
and, standing in the midst of the Vihāra, asked: 'Where is the Conqueror
eternal?' So they brought him, and when he saw the Exalted One, he said:
'Dost know me, Exalted One?' 'Yea, I know. But thou, where hast thou
spent the time?' 'In the Vankahāra country, lord.' 'Upaka, thou art now
an old man; canst thou bear the religious life?' 'I will enter thereon,
lord.' The Master bade a certain Bhikkhu, 'Come, do thou, Bhikkhu,
ordain him.' And he thereafter exercising and training himself, was soon
established in the Fruition of the Path-of-No-Return, and thereupon
died, being reborn in the Aviha heavens.
[<sup>358</sup>](pos18.htm#131-1.md) At the moment of that rebirth he
attained Arahantship.

Seven have thus attained it, as it has been said.

But Cāpā, sick at heart over his departure, delivered her boy to his
grandfather, and, following in the way Upaka had gone, renounced the
world at Sāvatthī, and attained Arahantship. And uniting Upaka's verses
with her own, she thus exulted:

### <span id="LXIX">LXIX Sundarī.</span>

She too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up
good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, was reborn
thirty-one æons ago, when Vessabhu was Buddha, in a clansman's family.
One day she ministered to the Master with alms, and worshipped him, and
he perceived her believing heart, and thanked her. After celestial and
other happy rebirths, her knowledge having come to maturity, she was, in
this Buddha-age, reborn at Benares as the daughter of Sujāta, a brahmin.
Because of her perfect form they called her Sundarī (Beauty). When she
grew up, her younger brother died. Her father, overmastered by grief,
and going to and fro, met the Therī Vāsiṭṭhī
[<sup>362</sup>](pos18.htm#135-1.md) When she asked him what afflicted him,
he answered as in the first two verses. Wishing to allay his grief, she
spoke the next two verses, and told him of her own griefless state. The
brahmin asked her: 'How, lady, did you become free from grief
(*a-sokā*)?' The Therī told him of the Three Jewels, the Refuges.
'Where,' he asked, 'is the Master?' 'He is now at Mithilā.' So the
brahmin drove in his carriage to Mithilā and sought audience of the
Master. To him the Master taught the Norm; and he believed, and entered
the Order, attaining Arahantship on the third day, after strenuous
effort in establishing insight.

But the charioteer drove his chariot back to Benares, and told the
brahminee what had taken place. When Sundarī heard of it, she asked her
mother, saying: 'Mother, I too would leave the world.' The mother said:
'All the wealth in this house belongs to you. You are the heiress of
this family. Take up your heritage and enjoy it. Go not forth.' But
Sundarī said: 'Wealth is no use to me. Mother, I would leave the world;'
and, bringing the mother to consent, she abandoned her great possessions
like so much spittle, and entered the Order (at Benares). And studying
and striving because of the promise in her and the maturity of her
knowledge, she attained Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Norm in
form and meaning.

Dwelling thereafter in the ease of fruition and the bliss of Nibbana,
she thought: 'I will utter a Lion's Roar
[<sup>363</sup>](pos18.htm#136-1.md) before the Master.' And asking
permission of her teacher, she left Benares, accompanied by a great
following of Bhikkhunīs, and in due course came to Sāvatthī, did
obeisance to the Master, and stood on one side. Welcomed by him, she
declared her A<span class="small">ÑÑĀ</span> by extolling her relation
to him as the 'daughter of his mouth,' and so on. Thereupon all her
kinsfolk, beginning with her mother, and their attendants, renounced the
world. She, reflecting on her attainment, and using her father's
utterances in her own Psalm, exulted as follows:

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up
good of age-enduring efficacy, so that she had progressively planted the
root of good and accumulated the conditions of emancipation, was, in
this Buddha-era, reborn at Rājagaha as the daughter of a certain
goldsmith. From the beauty of her person she was called Subhā. Come to
years of discretion, she went one day, while the Master was at Rājagaha,
and belief in him had come to her, and did obeisance, seating herself on
one side. The Master, seeing the maturity of her moral faculties, and in
accordance with her wish, taught her the Norm enshrined in the Four
Truths. She was thereby established in the fruition of Stream-entry,
which is in countless ways adorned. Later she realized the disadvantages
of domestic life, and entered the Order under the Great Pajāpatī the
Gotamid, devoting herself to the higher Paths. From time to time her
relations invited her to return to the world, urging its charms. To them
thus come one day, she set forth the danger in house-life and in the
world, preaching the Norm in the twenty-four verses below, and dismissed
them cured of their desire. She then strove for insight, purifying her
faculties, till at length she won Arahantship. As Arahant she spoke
thus:

When, on the eighth day after her ordination, she won Arahantship,
attaining fruition, seated beneath a tree, the Exalted One uttered these
three verses ([362](pos18.htm#362)-364.md) in her praises, pointing her out
to the Brethren. And the last verse was added by them who recited (the
canon at the Council), to celebrate Sakka's adoration.
