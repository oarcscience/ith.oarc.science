## <span id="C-II">CANTO II PSALMS OF TWO VERSES</span>

### <span id="XIX">XIX Abhirūpa-Nandā.</span>

B<span class="small">ORN</span> in the time of the Buddha Vipassi, in
his native town of Bandhumatī, as the daughter of a wealthy burgess, she
became a pious lay-adherent, and at the Master's death she made an
offering to the shrine of his ashes of a golden umbrella
[<sup>117</sup>](pos07.htm#22-1) surrounded with jewels. Reborn for this
in various heavens, she was, in this Buddha-dispensation, reborn at
Kapilavatthu as the daughter of the chief wife of Khemaka, the Sākiyan,
and named Nandā. But because of her excessive beauty, charm, and
loveliness, she was known as Nandā the Fair.

Now, on the day when she was to choose among her
suitors,[<sup>118</sup>](pos07.htm#22-2) Carabhūta, her young Sākiyan
kinsman, died. Then her parents made her leave the world against her
will. But she, even after she had entered the Order, was infatuated with
her own beauty, and, fearing the Master's rebuke, avoided his presence.
Now the Exalted One knew that she was ripe for knowledge, and directed
the Great Pajājatī to let all the Bhikkhunīs come to him for
instruction. Nandā sent another in her place. And the Exalted One said,
'Let no one come by proxy.' So she was compelled to come. And the
Exalted One, by his mystic power, conjured up a beautiful woman, and
showed her becoming aged and fading, causing anguish to arise in Nandā.
And he addressed her in these words:

<p><span id="19">Behold, Nandā, the foul compound, diseased,<br />

And when he had finished speaking, she attained Arahantship. Repeating
to herself the verses, she made them the announcement of her A<span

### <span id="XX">XX Jentī (or Jentā).</span>

The story of her past and present is like that of Nandā the Fair; but it
was at Vesālī, in the princely family of the Licchavis, that she was
reborn. [<sup>121</sup>](pos07.htm#23-3) There is this further
difference: she attained Arahantship after hearing the Master preach the
Dhamma, and it was when reflecting on the change that had come over her
that she, in joy, uttered these verses:

### <span id="XXI">XXI Sumangala's Mother.</span>

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up
good in this rebirth and that, was born under this Buddha-dispensation
in a poor family at Sāvatthī, and was married to a rush-plaiter. Her
firstborn was a son, come for the last time to birth, who grew up to
become the Elder Sumangala and an
Arahant.[<sup>124</sup>](pos07.htm#24-3) And her name not becoming
known, she was called in the Pali text a certain unknown Therī, and is
known as Sumangala's mother. She became a Bhikkhunī, and one day, while
reflecting on all she had suffered as a laywoman, she was much affected,
and, her insight quickening, she attained Arahantship, with thorough
knowledge of the form and meaning of the Dhamma. Thereupon she
exclaimed:

<span id="23">O woman well set free! how free am I,</span>
[<sup>125</sup>](pos07.htm#25-1)  
How throughly free from kitchen drudgery!  
Me stained and squalid 'mong my cooking-pots  
My brutal husband ranked as even less  
Than the sunshades he sits and weaves
alway.[<sup>126</sup>](pos07.htm#25-2) (23)  
<span id="24">  
Purged now of all my former lust and hate,  
I dwell, musing at ease beneath the shade  
Of spreading boughs–O, but 'tis well with me! (24)</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="XXII">XXII Aḍḍhakāsī.</span>

Born of a respectable family, in the time of Kassapa Buddha, she won
understanding, and became a Bhikkhunī, established in the precepts. But
she reviled an Arahant Elder Sister by calling her a
prostitute,[<sup>127</sup>](pos07.htm#25-3) and for this she went to
purgatory. In this Buddha-dispensation she was reborn in the kingdom of
Kāsī as the child of a distinguished and prosperous citizen. But because
of the persistent effect of her former evil speech, she became herself a
prostitute. How she left the world and was ordained by special messenger
is related in the Culla Vagga. [<sup>128</sup>](pos07.htm#26-1) For she
wished to go to Sāvatthī to be ordained by the Exalted One. But the
libertines of Benares barred the ways, so she sent and asked the Exalted
One's advice, and he permitted her to be ordained by a messenger. Then
she, working at insight, not long after obtained Arahantship, with
thorough knowledge of the Dhamma in form and meaning. Thereupon she
exclaimed:

### <span id="XXIII">XXIII Cittā.</span>

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up
good of age-enduring efficacy in this rebirth and that, was born in the
94th æon [<sup>130</sup>](pos07.htm#27-1) as a fairy. She worshipped
with offering of flowers a Silent (Pacceka) Buddha.
[<sup>131</sup>](pos07.htm#27-2) And after many other births among men
and gods, she was, in this Buddha-dispensation, born at Rājagaha in the
family of a leading burgess. When she had come to years of discretion
she heard the Master teaching at the gate of Rājagaha, and, becoming a
believer, she was ordained by the Great Pajāpatī the Gotamid. And at
length, in her old age, when she had climbed the Vulture's Peak, and had
done the exercises of a recluse, her insight expanded, and she won to
Arahantship. Reflecting thereon, she gave utterance as follows:

### <span id="XXIV">XXIV Mettikā.</span>

Heaping up merit under former Buddhas, she was born during the time of
Siddhattha, [<sup>132</sup>](pos07.htm#28-1) the Exalted One, in a
burgess's family, and worshipped at his shrine by offering there a
jewelled girdle. After many births in heaven and on earth, through the
merit thereof, she became, in this Buddha-dispensation, the child of an
eminent brahmin at Rājagaha. In other respects her case is like the
preceding one, save that it was another hill corresponding to Vulture's
Peak up which she climbed. [<sup>133</sup>](pos07.htm#28-2)

She, too, reflecting on what she had won, said in exultation:

Born in the time of Vipassi Buddha of a noble family, and become a lady
of his father's court, she won meritorious karma by bestowing food and
precious raiment on an Arahant Elder Sister.
[<sup>136</sup>](pos07.htm#29-2) Born finally, in this
Buddha-dispensation, in the princely family of the Sākiyas, at
Kapilavatthu, she left the world together with Great Pajāpatī the
Gotamid, and, going through the requisite training for insight, not long
after won Arahantship.

Reflecting thereon, joy and gladness stirred her to say:

### <span id="XXVI">XXVI Abhayā's Mother.</span>

Heaping up merit under former Buddhas, she, in the time of Tissa
Buddha,[<sup>138</sup>](pos07.htm#30-1) saw him going round for alms,
and with glad heart took his bowl and placed in it a spoonful of food.
Reborn for that among gods and among men, she was born also for that, in
this Buddha-dispensation, and became the town belle of Ujjenī, by name
Padumavatī.[<sup>139</sup>](pos07.htm#30-2) And King Bimbisāra (of
Magadha) heard of her, and expressed to his chaplain the wish to see
her. By the power of his spells, the chaplain summoned a Yakkha who, by
his might, brought the King to Ujjenī. And when she afterwards sent word
to the King that she was with child by him, he sent back word, saying:
'If it be a son, let me see him when he is grown.' And she bore a son
and called him Abhaya. When he was seven years old she told him who was
his father, and sent him to Bimbisāra. The King loved the boy, and let
him grow up with the boys of his court. His conversion and ordination is
told in the Psalms of the Elders.[<sup>140</sup>](pos07.htm#30-3) And,
later on, his mother heard her son preach the Dhamma, and she, too, left
the world and afterwards attained Arahantship, with thorough grasp of
the Dhamma in form and meaning. She thereupon recalled and repeated the
verse wherewith her son had admonished her, and added her own thereto:

<span id="33">'Upward from sole of foot, O mother dear,  
Downward from crown of hair this body see.  
Is't not impure, the evil-smelling thing?' (33)</span>  
<span id="34">This have I pondered. meditating still,  
Till every throb of lust is rooted out.  
Expunged is all the fever of desire.  
Cool am I now and calm–Nibbana's peace. (34)</span>

### <span id="XXVII">XXVII Abhayā.</span>[<sup>141</sup>](pos07.htm#31-1)

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up
merit of age-enduring efficacy in this and that state of becoming, was,
in the time of Sikhi Buddha,[<sup>142</sup>](pos07.htm#31-2) reborn in a
great noble's family, and became the chief queen of his father Aruṇa.
And one day she worshipped the Exalted One with offering of red lotuses
given her by the King, when Sikhi Buddha, at alms-time, entered the
palace. Reborn for this among gods and men, she was, in this
Buddha-dispensation, born once more at Ujjenī in a respectable family,
and became the playmate of Abhaya's mother. And when the latter had left
the world, Abhayā, for love of her, also took orders. Dwelling with her
at Rājagaha, she went one day to Cool-Grove to contemplate on a basis of
some foul thing.[<sup>143</sup>](pos07.htm#31-3) The Master, seated in
his Fragrant Chamber, caused her to see before her the kind of object
she had been directed to choose. Seeing the vision, dread seized her.
Then the Master, sending forth glory, appeared as if seated before her,
and said:

And when he had finished speaking she attained Arahantship. Exulting

### <span id="XXVIII">XXVIII Sāmā.</span>

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up
good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that state of becoming, being
reborn in fortunate conditions, took birth, in this Buddha-dispensation,
at Kosambī, in the family of an eminent burgess. When her dear friend,
the lay-disciple Sāmāvatī, died, she, in her distress, left the world.
But being unable to subdue her grief for her friend, she was unable to
grasp the Ariyan Way. Now, while she was seated in the sitting-room,
listening to Elder Ānanda preaching, she was established in insight,
and, on the seventh day after, attained Arahantship, with thorough grasp
of the Dhamma in form and meaning.

And reflecting on what she had won, she expressed it in this psalm:
