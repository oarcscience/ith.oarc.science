### <span id="NOTES">NOTES </span>

I. On clansmen, to which reference is so often made in the Chronicles
(clansman's family=*kulageha*), see Rhys Davids, *Buddhist India*,
17-22. 'Treasurer' or 'merchant' stands for *seṭṭhi*, a leading
commoner, head (*seṭṭhi*=chief) of a guild, and often treasurer to a
King.

II\. On the co-existing customs of cremation and exposure of the dead,
to which the Psalms testify, see Rhys Davids, *Buddhist India*, 78 ſ.

III\. In the [note on p. 66](pos10.htm#66-1.md), reference should have been
made to the Viticcha-jātaka, No. 244, in the second volume of the
Jātaka. Here the Buddha himself asks the question, *Ekaŋ nāma kiŋ*?
whereupon the itinerant debater runs away! The birth-story is then told,
the question being *contra* the theory of the *Ding-an-sich*.

### <span id="CORRIGENDUM">CORRIGENDUM </span>

In [verse 72](pos10.htm#72.md), where Professors Pischel and E. Müller have
read

> *... aññā samatimaññi 'haŋ,*

I now incline, with the Commentary, to read

> *aññāsam atimaññi 'haŋ,*

and would amend the English thus:

> *Filled with the pride of my youth, I scorned and despised other
> women.*

Again, in [verse 74](pos10.htm#74.md), a truer rendering would be:

> *Manifold wiles I wrought, mocking with insolent laughter.*

And in [verse 76](pos10.htm#76.md), for 'calm' read 'cool.'
