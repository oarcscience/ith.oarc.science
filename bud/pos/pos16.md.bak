## <span id="C-XI">CANTO XI PSALM OF TWELVE VERSES</span>

### <span id="LXIV">LXIV Uppalavaṇṇā.</span>

S<span class="small">HE</span>, too, was born, when Padumuttara was
Buddha, at the city Haŋsavatī, in a clansman's family. And, when grown
up, she heard, with a great multitude, the Master teach, and assign a
certain Bhikkhunī the chief place among those who had mystic
potency.[<sup>318</sup>](pos16.htm#111-1.md) And she gave great gifts for
seven days to the Buddha and the Order, and aspired to that same rank. .
. .

In this Buddha-age, she was reborn at Sāvatthī as the daughter of the
Treasurer. And because her skin was of the colour of the heart
[<sup>319</sup>](pos16.htm#111-2.md) of the blue lotus, they called her
Uppalavaṇṇā.[<sup>320</sup>](pos16.htm#111-3.md) Now, when she was come of
age, kings and commoners from the whole of India sent messengers to her
father, saying: 'Give us your daughter.' Thereupon the Treasurer
thought: 'I cannot possibly meet the wishes of all. I will devise a
plan.' And, sending for his daughter, he said: 'Dear one, are you able
to leave the world?' To her, because she was in her final stage of life,
his words were as if oil a hundred times refined had anointed her head.
Therefore she said: 'Dear father, I will renounce the world!' He,
honouring her, brought her to the Bhikkhunīs' quarters, and let her be
ordained.

A little while afterwards it became her turn for office in the house of
the Sabbath.[<sup>321</sup>](pos16.htm#112-1.md) And, lighting the lamp,
she swept the room. Then taking the flame of the lamp as a visible sign,
and contemplating it continually, she brought about Jhana by way of the
Lambent Artifice,[<sup>322</sup>](pos16.htm#112-2.md) and making that her
stepping-stone, she attained Arahantship. With its fruition, intuition
and grasp of the Norm were achieved, and she became especially versed in
the mystic potency of transformation.[<sup>323</sup>](pos16.htm#112-3.md)

And the Master, seated in conclave in the Jeta Grove, assigned her the
foremost rank in the mystic powers. She, pondering the bliss of Jhana
and of fruition, repeated one day certain verses. They had been uttered
in anguish by a mother who had been living as her daughter's rival with
him who later, when a Bhikkhu, became known as the Ganges-bank
Elder,[<sup>324</sup>](pos16.htm#112-4.md) and were a reflection on the
harm, the vileness and corruption of sensual desires:

Joyful and happy, she meditates on the distinction she has won:

She works a marvel before the Buddha with his consent, and records the

She is disturbed by Māra in the Sāl-tree Grove, and rebukes him:

NOTE.–Four *gāthā*'s ascribed to this famous Sister are, in the
*Therigāthā*, recorded without break. The Commentary breaks them up into
four episodes. In the first, a merchant's wife at Sāvatthī, about to
bear her first child in her husband's prolonged absence on business at
Rājagaha, is turned out by his mother, who disbelieves the wife's
fidelity. She seeking her husband, and delivered of a son at a wayside
bungalow, another merchant carries off the babe in her absence, and
adopts it. A robber-chief finds the distracted mother, and she bears him
a daughter. This child she accidentally injures, and flees from the
chief's wrath. Years after her son, yet a youth, weds both mother and
daughter, ignorant of the kinship. The mother discovers the scar on her
daughter's head, and identifies her rival as her own child.
