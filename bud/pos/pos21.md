## <span id="C-XVI">CANTO XVI PSALM OF THE GREAT CHAPTER</span>

### <span id="LXXIII">LXXIII Sumedhā</span>

S<span class="small">HE</span> too, having made her resolve under former
Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that
rebirth, thoroughly preparing the conditions of emancipation, was born,
when Koṇāgamana was Buddha, in a clansman's family. When she was of age,
she and her friends, clansmen's daughters, agreed together to have a
great park made, and handed it over to the Buddha and his Order. Through
the merit of that act, she was reborn in the heaven of the
Three-and-Thirty. After a glorious period there, she arose once more
among the Yāma gods, then among the Blissful gods, then among the Happy
Creators, then among the Disposers of others' creations,
[<sup>410</sup>](pos21.htm#164-1.md) and there became Queen of the King of
the gods. Reborn thereafter, when Kassapa was Buddha, as the daughter of
a wealthy citizen, she acquired splendid merit as a lay-believer,
winning another rebirth among the gods of the Three-and-Thirty. Finally
reborn, in this Buddha-age, at the city of Mantāvatī, as the daughter of
King Koñca, [<sup>411</sup>](pos21.htm#164-2.md) she was named Sumedhā. And
when she was come to years of discretion, her mother and father agreed
to let Anikaratta, the Rāja of Vāraṇavatī, see her. But she from her
childhood had been in the habit of going with Princesses of her own age
and attendant slaves to the Bhikkhunīs' quarters to hear them preach the
Doctrine, and for a long time, because of her pristine resolve, she had
grown fearful of birth in the round of life, devoted to religion and
averse to the pleasures of sense.

Wherefore, when she heard the decision of her parents and kinsfolk, she
said: 'My duty lies not in the life of the house. I will leave the
world.' And they were not able to dissuade her. She thinking, 'Thus
shall I gain permission to leave the world,' laid hold of her purpose,
and cut off her own hair. Then using her hair in accordance with what
she had heard from the Bhikkhunīs of their methods, she concentrated her
attention on repugnance to physical attraction, and calling up the idea
of 'Foul Things,' [<sup>412</sup>](pos21.htm#165-1.md) then and there
attained First Jhāna. And when she was thus rapt, her parents came to
her apartments in order to give her away. But she made them first and
all their retinue and all the Raja's people believers in religion, and
left the house, renouncing the world in the Bhikkhunīs' quarters.

Not long after, establishing insight, and ripe for emancipation, she
attained Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and in
meaning. And reflecting on her victory, she broke forth in exultation:

They cannot grasp what maketh sorrow rise–<br />
When taught, they learn not; in their slumb'ring minds<br />
The Fourfold Ariyan Truth awakens not. (453)</span><br />
<span id="454">Those Truths, O mother, that th' Awakened One,<br />
The Best, the Buddha, hath revealed to us,<br />
They, the Majority, know not, and they<br />

Becoming needs must be impermanent.<br />
Yet they, the foolish souls, are not afraid<br />
Again, again to come somewhere to birth. (455)<br />
<span id="456">Four are the ways of doleful life, and two<br />
Alone the ways of weal</span> <a href="pos21.htm#166-3"><sup>416</sup></a> –and these how hard<br />
To win! Nor if one come into the four,<br />
Is there renunciation from <em>that</em> world. (456)<br />
<span id="457">Suffer ye both that I renounce my world;<br />
And in the blessed teaching of the Lord,<br />
Him of the Powers Ten,</span> <a href="pos21.htm#167-1"><sup>417</sup></a> heedless of all<br />
Without, I'll strive to root out birth and death. (457)<br />
<span id="458">How can I take delight in many births,<br />
In this poor body, froth without a soul?</span> <a href="pos21.htm#167-2"><sup>418</sup></a><br />
That I may put an utter end to thirst<br />
Again to be, suffer that I go forth. (458)<br />
<span id="459">Now is the Age of Buddhas! Gone the want<br />
Of opportunity! The moment's won!<br />
O let me never while I live misprize<br />
The precepts, nor withstand the holy life!' (459)</span><br />
<br />
<span id="460">Thus spake Sumedhā, and again: 'Mother<br />
And father mine, never again will I<br />
As a laywoman break my fast and eat.<br />
Here will I sooner lay me down and die!' (460)</span><br />
<span id="461"></span></p>
<p>Th' afflicted mother wept; the father, stunned<br />
With grief, strove to dissuade and comfort her<br />
Who prostrate lay upon the palace floor:– (461)<br />
<span id="462">'Rise up, dear child. Why this unhappiness<br />
For thee? Thou art betrothed to go and reign<br />
In Vāraṇavatī, the promised bride<br />
Of King Anikaratta, handsome youth. (462)</span><br />
<span id="463">Thou art to be his chief consort, his queen.<br />
Hard is it, little child, to leave the world,<br />
Hard are the precepts and the holy life. (463)</span><br />
<span id="464">As queen thou wilt enjoy authority,<br />
Riches and sov'reignty and luxuries.<br />
Thou that art blest herein and young, enjoy<br />
The sweets life yields. Let's to thy wedding, child.' (464)</span><br />
<br />
<span id="465">Then answered them Sumedhā: 'Nay, not thus!<br />
No soul, no essence, can becoming yield.<br />
One or the other shall be–choose ye which:<br />
Or let me leave the world, or let me die.<br />
Thus, and thus only, would I choose to wed.</span> <a href="pos21.htm#168-1"><sup>419</sup></a> (465)<br />
<span id="466">What is it worth</span> <a href="pos21.htm#168-2"><sup>420</sup></a> –this body foul, unclean,<br />
Emitting odours, source of fears, a bag<br />
Of skin with carrion filled, oozing impure (466)<br />
<span id="467">The while? What is it worth to me who know–<br />
Repulsive carcass, plastered o'er with flesh<br />
And blood, the haunt of worms, dinner of birds–<br />
To whom shall such a thing as this be given? (467)</span><br />
<span id="468">Borne in a little while to charnel-field,<br />
There is this body thrown, when mind hath sped,</span> <a href="pos21.htm#168-3"><sup>421</sup></a><br />
Like useless log, from which e'en kinsfolk turn. (468)<br />
<span id="469">Throwing the thing that they have bathed to be<br />
The food of alien things, whereat recoil<br />
The very parents, let alone their kin. (469)</span><br />
<span id="470">They have a fondness for this soulless frame,<br />
That's knit of bones and sinews, body foul,<br />
Filled full of exudations manifold. (470)</span><br />
<span id="471">Where one the body to dissect, and turn<br />
The inside outermost, the smell would prove<br />
Too much for e'en one's mother to endure. (471)</span><br />
<span id="472">The factors of my being, organs, elements,<br />
All are a transient compound, rooted deep<br />
In birth, are Ill, and first and last the thing<br />
I would not.</span> <a href="pos21.htm#169-1"><sup>422</sup></a> Whom, then, could I choose to wed? (472)<br />
<span id="473">Rather would I find death day after day<br />
With spears three hundred piercing me anew,<br />
E'en for an hundred years, if this would then<br />
Put a last end to pain, unending else. (473)</span><br />
<span id="474">The wise would with this [bargain] close, and meet<br />
Utter destruction, seeing that His Word,<br />
The Master's, runneth: "Long the wandering<br />
Of them who, smitten, ever rise again."</span> <a href="pos21.htm#169-2"><sup>423</sup></a> (474)<br />
<span id="475">Countless the ways in which we meet our death,<br />
'Mong gods and men, as demons or as beasts,<br />
Among the shades, or in the haunts of hell.</span><a href="pos21.htm#169-3"><sup>424</sup></a> (475)<br />
<span id="476">And there how many doomed tormented live!<br />
No sure refuge is ours even in heaven.<br />
Above, beyond Nibbana's bliss, is naught. (476)</span><br />
<span id="477">And they have won that Bliss who all their hearts<br />
Have plighted to the blessed Word of Him<br />
Who hath the Tenfold Power, and heeding naught,<br />
Have striv'n to put far from them birth and death. (477)</span><br />
<span id="478">This day, my father, will I get me forth!<br />
I'll naught of empty riches! Sense-desires<br />
Repel and sicken me, and are become<br />
E'en as the stump where once hath stood a palm.' (478)</span><br />
<br />
<span id="479">So spake she to her father. Now the King,<br />
Anikaratta, on his way to woo<br />
His youthful bride's consent, drew near<br />
At the appointed time. But Sumedhā (479)</span><br />
<span id="480">Let down the soft black masses of her hair<br />
And with a dagger cut them off. Then closed<br />
The door that led to her own terraced rooms,<br />
And forthwith to First Jhana-rapture won. (480)</span><br />
<span id="481">There sat she lost in ecstasy, the while<br />
Anikaratta reached the capital.<br />
Then she fell musing on impermanence,<br />
Developing the thought.</span> <a href="pos21.htm#170-1"><sup>425</sup></a> Then is she ware (481)<br />
<span id="482">The while Anikaratta swiftly mounts<br />
The palace steps, in brave array of gems<br />
And gold, and bowing low woos Sumedhā. (482)</span><br />
<br />
<span id="483">'Reign in my kingdom and enjoy my wealth<br />
And power. Rich, happy and so young thou art,<br />
Enjoy the sweets that life and love can yield,<br />
Though they be hard to win and won by few. (483)</span><br />
<span id="484">To thee my kingdom I surrender! Now<br />
Dispose as thou dost wish, give gifts galore.<br />
Be not downcast. Thy parents are distressed.' (484)</span><br />
<br />
<span id="485">To him thus Sumedhā, for whom desires<br />
Of sensuous love were worthless, nor availed<br />
To lead astray, made answer: 'O set not<br />
The heart's affections on this sensual love.<br />
See all the peril, the satiety of sense. (485)</span><br />
<span id="486">Mandhātā, King o' th' world's four continents,</span> <a href="pos21.htm#171-1"><sup>426</sup></a><br />
Had greater wealth to gratify his sense<br />
Than any other man, yet passed away<br />
Unsatisfied, his wishes unfulfilled. (486)<br />
<span id="487">Nay, an the rain-god rained all seven kinds<br />
Of gems till earth and heaven were full, still would<br />
The senses crave, and men insatiate die. (487)</span><br />
<span id="488">'Like the sharp blades of swords are sense-desires.'<br />
'Like the poised heads of snakes prepared to dart.'<br />
'Like blazing torches,' and 'like bare gnawn bones.'</span> <a href="pos21.htm#171-2"><sup>427</sup></a> (488)<br />
<span id="489">Transient, unstable are desires of sense,<br />
Pregnant with Ill and full of venom dire,<br />
Searing as heated iron globe to touch.<br />
Baneful the root of them, baleful the fruit. (489)</span><br />
<span id="490">As 'fruit'</span> <a href="pos21.htm#171-3"><sup>428</sup></a> that brings the climber to a fall,<br />
Are sense-desires; evil as 'lumps of flesh'<br />
That greedy birds one from the other snatch;<br />
As cheating 'dreams'; as 'borrowed goods' reclaimed. (490)<br />
<span id="491">'As spears and jav'lins are desires of sense,'<br />
'A pestilence, a boil, and bane and bale.<br />
A furnace of live coals,' the root of bane,<br />
Murderous and the source of harrowing dread. (491)</span><br />
<br />
<span id="492">So hath the direfulness of sense-desires,<br />
Those barriers to salvation, been declared.<br />
Go, leave me, for I do not trust myself,<br />
While in this world I yet have part and lot. (492)</span><br />
<span id="493">What shall another do for me? For me<br />
Whose head is wrapped in flames,</span> <a href="pos21.htm#172-1"><sup>429</sup></a> whose steps are dogged<br />
By age and death that tarry not. To crush<br />
Them utterly I needs must strive.' (493)<br />
<br />
<span id="494">Then coming to her door she saw the king<br />
Her suitor, and her parents seated there<br />
And shedding tears. And once more spake to them: (494)</span><br />
<br />
<span id="495">'Long have they yet to wander through the worlds<br />
Who witless aye again their tears renew,<br />
Weeping world without end for father dead,<br />
Or brother slain, or that themselves must die.</span> <a href="pos21.htm#172-2"><sup>430</sup></a> (495)<br />
<span id="496">Call ye to mind how it was said that tears<br />
And milk and blood flow on world without end.<br />
And bear in mind that tumulus of bones<br />
By creatures piled who wander through the worlds. (496)</span><br />
<span id="497">Remember the four oceans as compared<br />
With all the flow of tears and milk and blood.<br />
Remember the 'great cairn of one man's bones<br />
From one æon alone, equal to Vipula'; (497)</span><br />
<span id="498">And how 'great India</span> <a href="pos21.htm#173-1"><sup>431</sup></a> would not suffice<br />
To furnish little tally-balls of mould,<br />
Wherewith to number all the ancestors<br />
Of one's own round of life world without end.' (498)<br />
<span id="499">Remember how 'the little squares of straws<br />
And boughs and twigs could ne'er suffice<br />
As tallies for one's sires world without end.' (499)</span><br />
<span id="500">Remember how the parable was told<br />
Of 'purblind turtle in the Eastern Seas,<br />
Or other oceans, once as time goes by,<br />
Thrusting his head thro' hole of drifting yoke';<br />
So rare as this the chance of human birth.</span> <a href="pos21.htm#173-2"><sup>432</sup></a> (500)<br />
<span id="501">Remember too the 'body'-parable,<br />
The 'lump of froth,' of spittle without core,<br />
Drifting. See here the fleeting factors five.<br />
And O forget not hell where many thole. (501)</span><br />
<span id="502">Remember how we swell the charnel-fields,<br />
Now dying, now again elsewhere reborn.<br />
Remember what was said of 'crocodiles,'</span> <a href="pos21.htm#174-1"><sup>433</sup></a><br />
And what those perils meant for us, and O!<br />
Bear ye in mind the Four, the Ariyan Truths. (502)<br />
<br />
<span id="503">T<span class="small">HE NECTAR OF THE NORM IS HERE</span>!</span> <a href="pos21.htm#174-2"><sup>434</sup></a> O how<br />
Canst thou be satisfied with bitter draughts<br />
Of sense satiety? All sensual joys<br />
Are bitterer for the fivefold dogging Ill. <a href="pos21.htm#174-3"><sup>435</sup></a>(503)<br />
<br />
<span id="504">T<span class="small">HE NECTAR OF THE NORM IS HERE</span>! O how<br />
Canst thou be satisfied with fevered fits<br />
Of sense-satiety? All sensual joys<br />

Canst thou be satisfied with joys of sense<br />
Engend'ring thee so many foes–the wrath<br />
Or greed of king, or thief, or rival, harm<br />
Through fire, or water–yea, so many foes! (505)<br />
<br />
<span id="506">E<span class="small">MANCIPATION <a href="pos21.htm#175-1"><sup>438</sup></a> WAITS</span>! O how canst thou<br />
Be satisfied with sensual joys, wherein<br />
Lie bonds and death? Yea, in those very joys<br />
Lurk gaol and headsman.</span> <a href="pos21.htm#175-2"><sup>439</sup></a> They who seek t' indulge<br />
Their lusts needs must thereafter suffer ills. (506)<br />
<span id="507">Him will straw-torches burn who holds them long<br />
And lets not go. So, in the parable,</span> <a href="pos21.htm#175-3"><sup>440</sup></a><br />
Desires of sense burn them who let not go. (507)<br />
<span id="508">Cast not away, because of some vain joy<br />
Of sense, the vaster happiness sublime,<br />
Lest like the finny carp thou gulp the hook,<br />
Only to find thyself for that foredone</span> <a href="pos21.htm#175-4"><sup>441</sup></a> (508)<br />
<span id="509">Tame thou thyself in sense-desires, nor let<br />
Thyself be bound by them, as is a dog<br />
Bound by a chain; else will they do forsooth<br />
With thee as hungry pariahs with that dog.</span> <a href="pos21.htm#175-5"><sup>442</sup></a> (509)<br />
<span id="510">Once more I say, immeasurable Ills<br />
And many weary miseries of mind<br />
Thou'lt suffer yoked to sensual life. Renounce,<br />
Renounce desires of sense! They pass away. (510)</span><br />
<br />
<span id="511">T<span class="small">HERE IS, THAT GROWETH NEVER OLD</span>!</span> <a href="pos21.htm#176-1"><sup>443</sup></a> O how<br />
Canst thou be satisfied with sense-desires<br />
That age so soon? Are not all things reborn,<br />
Where'er it be, gripped by disease and death? (511)<br />
<span id="512">T<span class="small">HIS</span></span> <a href="pos21.htm#176-2"><sup>444</sup></a> that doth ne'er grow old, that dieth not,<br />
T<span class="small">HIS</span> never-ageing, never-dying Path–<br />
No sorrow cometh there, no enemies,<br />
Nor is there any crowd; <a href="pos21.htm#176-3"><sup>445</sup></a> none faint or fail,<br />
No fear cometh, nor aught that doth torment– (512)<br />
<span id="513">To T<span class="small">HIS</span>, the Path Ambrosial, have gone<br />
Full many. And to-day, e'en now 'tis to be won.<br />

And ye shall not attain!'<br />
<br />
                         Thus Sumedhā (513)</span><br />
<span id="514">Ended her say, who found no joy in all<br />
Activities that lead from life to life,<br />
And, to Anikaratta thus her mind<br />
Declaring, dropped her tresses on the floor. (514)</span><br />
<span id="515">Then up he rose with outstretched folded hands,<br />
And with her father pleaded for her thus:<br />
'O suffer Sumedhā to leave the world,<br />
That she may see the Truth and Liberty!' (515)</span><br />
<br />
<span id="516">The parents suffered her, and forth she went,<br />
Afeared to stay and build up fear and grief.<br />
Six branches of Insight she realized,<br />
As learner, winning to the Topmost Fruit. (516)</span><br />

> Collocation) in the *Saŋyutta Nikāya*, vol. ii., 178 ſſ. The only
> feature lacking there is the perennial *blood*-flow–a point not
> without interest in the history of the Pali Canon. The bone-cairn

>
> > 'But *one* man's bones who has *one* æon lived  
> > Might form a cairn–so said the Mighty Seer–  
> > High as Vipulla, higher than the Peak  
> > Of Vultures, mountain-burg of Magadha'–
>
> *i.e.*, the ancient hill fortress of the Magadhese before they built
> their capital Rājagaha in the plain. No more ancient remains than

>   
> The repetition in verses [496](pos21.htm#496), [497](pos21.htm#497.md) is
> curious in a work where redundancy is so severely repressed. Either it

> different and later hand, or else two versions have here been

> three chief hearers: 'Call ye to mind' (*saratha*); the following
> admonitions are to the Prince only: 'bear in mind' and 'remember'
> (*sarāhi, sara*).

> <sup>431</sup> In the Vagga just alluded to, the earth itself, and not

<span id="173-2"></span>

> <sup>432</sup> This simile is from *Majjhima Nik.*, iii. 169, and
> *Saŋyutta Nik.*, v. 455. The 'body-parable' is from the latter work
> (iii. 140). The body (*rūpa*) is as empty of essence (soul) as the

<span id="174-1"></span>

> <sup>433</sup> The danger from crocodiles is, in two of the Nikāyas,

<span id="174-2"></span>

> <sup>434</sup> Nectar=*amataŋ*, rendered elsewhere in this work by
> 'ambrosia,' its etymological equivalent. Usually considered one of the

<span id="174-3"></span>

> <sup>435</sup> Lit., 'Are bitterer by the fivefold-bitter,' explained

<span id="174-4"></span>

> <sup>436</sup> *Kuthitā* may be from one of three roots: *kuth*,
> smell; *kuth*, distressed; *kvath*, cook (*cf.* Müller, *Pali
> Grammar*, 41). The first, chosen by Dr. Neumann, seems forced here.
> The last accords best with the other three metaphors of heating

<span id="174-5"></span>

> <sup>437</sup> Lit., 'The unhostile being' (locative absolute). The
> Pali has *no metaphor of place* whatever.

<span id="175-1"></span>

> <sup>438</sup> *Mokkhamhi vijjamāne*, lit., exists. *Mokkho*, probably
> substituted *metri causa* for *vimutti*, is a relatively late term.

<span id="175-2"></span>

> <sup>439</sup> These two terms are, in the text, the same as the

> <sup>442</sup> The dog, according to the Commentary, being unable to

> <sup>443</sup> She now, says the Commentary, turns to show forth the

<span id="176-2"></span>

> <sup>444</sup> *Asambādhaŋ*. The Commentary takes this figuratively:
> 'from the absence of the crowd of corruptions' (or torments,
> *kilesā*.). In view of the cardinal importance in the Vinaya of
> cultivating solitude (*cf.* Dhammadinnā in [Ps. xii.](pos06.htm#XII).md),
> because, too, of its being the path of the minority, and because of
> the Suttanta phrase calling the lay life *sambādha*, and the religious
> life *abbhokāsa*, free as air, I incline to take it literally.
