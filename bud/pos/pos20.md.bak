## <span id="C-XV">CANTO XV</span> [<sup>396</sup>](pos20.htm#156-1.md) PSALM OF OVER FORTY VERSES

### <span id="LXXII">LXXII Isidāsī.</span>

S<span class="small">HE</span> too, having made her resolve under former
Buddhas, and persisting in her former disposition in this and that
rebirth, in that she heaped up good of age-enduring efficacy, in the
seventh rebirth before her last phase of life, susceptible to
sex-attraction, wrought adulterous conduct. For this she did purgatory
for many centuries, and thereafter for three rebirths was an animal.
Thereafter she was brought forth by a slave-woman as an hermaphrodite,
and thereafter she was born as the daughter of a poor common man, and
was, when of age, married to the son of a caravan-leader named Giridāsa.
Now the wife that he had was virtuous and of noble qualities, and the
new wife envied her, and quarrelled with the husband because of her.
After her death she was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at Ujjenī
[<sup>397</sup>](pos20.htm#156-2.md) as the daughter of a virtuous,
honoured and wealthy merchant, and was named Isidāsī.
[<sup>398</sup>](pos20.htm#156-3.md) When she was of age, her parents gave
her in marriage to a merchant's son, a good match with herself. For a
month she dwelt with him as a devoted wife; then, as the fruit of her
previous actions, her husband became estranged from her, and turned her
out of his house. All this is told in the Pali text. Because she had not
proved desirable for one husband after another, she grew agitated and,
gaining her father's consent, took orders under the Therī Jinadattā. And
studying for insight, she not long after attained Arahantship, together
with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and meaning.

Dwelling in the bliss of fruition and Nibbana, she one day, after
seeking her meal in the city of Patna and dining, sat down on a sandbank
of great Ganges, and being asked by her companion, the Therī Bodhi,
about her previous experience, she related it by way of verses. And to
show the connection of her former and latter replies, these three
stanzas were inserted by the Recensionists:

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong></strong>
<p><span id="400">In the fair city of Patna, earth's fairest city,<br />
Named for its beauty after the Trumpet-flower,</span> <a href="pos20.htm#157-1"><sup>399</sup></a><br />
Dwelt two saintly Sisters, born of the Sākiyas, (400)<br />
<span id="401">Isidāsī the one, Bodhi the other.<br />
Precept-observers, lovers of Jhāna-rapture,<br />
Learnèd ladies and cleansed from the taint of all worldliness. (401)</span><br />
<span id="402">These having made their round, and broken their fasting,<br />
Washed their bowls, and sitting in happy seclusion,<br />
Spake thus one to the other, asking and answering: (402)</span><br />
<br />
<span id="403">'Thou hast a lovely mien, Isidāsī,<br />
Fresh and unwithered yet thy woman's prime,<br />
What flaw in the life yonder hast thou seen,<br />
That thou didst choose surrender for thy lot?' (403)</span><br />
<span id="404">Then in that quiet spot Isidāsī,<br />
Skilled in the exposition of the Norm,<br />
Took up her tale and thus did make reply:<br />
'Hear, Bodhi, how it was that I came forth. (404)</span><br />
<br />
<span id="405">In Ujjenī,</span> <a href="pos20.htm#158-1"><sup>400</sup></a> Avantī's foremost town,<br />
My father dwells, a virtuous citizen,<br />
His only daughter I, his well-beloved,<br />
The fondly cherished treasure of his life. (405)<br />
<span id="406">Now from Sāketa came a citizen<br />
Of the first rank and rich exceedingly<br />
To ask my hand in marriage for his son.<br />
And father gave me him, as daughter-in-law. (406)</span><br />
<span id="407">My salutation morn and eve I brought<br />
To both the parents of my husband, low<br />
Bowing my head and kneeling at their feet,<br />
According to the training given me. (407)</span><br />
<span id="408">My husband's sisters and his brothers too,<br />
And all his kin, scarce were they entered when<br />
I rose in timid zeal and gave them place. (408)</span><br />
<span id="409">And as to food, or boiled or dried, and drink,<br />
That which was to be stored I set aside,<br />
And served it out and gave to whom 'twas due. (409)</span><br />
<span id="410">Rising betimes, I went about the house,<br />
Then with my hands and feet well cleansed I went<br />
To bring respectful greeting to my lord, (410)</span><br />
<span id="411">And taking comb and mirror, unguents, soap,<br />
I dressed and groomed him as a handmaid might. (411)</span><br />
<span id="412"><em>I</em> boiled the rice, <em>I</em> washed the pots and pans;<br />
And as a mother on her only child,<br />
So did I minister to my good man. (412)</span><br />
<span id="413">For me, who with toil infinite thus worked,<br />
And rendered service with a humble mind,<br />
Rose early, ever diligent and good,<br />
For me he nothing felt save sore dislike. (413)</span><br />
<span id="414">Nay, to his mother and his father he<br />
Thus spake:–'Give ye me leave and I will go,<br />
For not with Isidāsī will I live<br />
Beneath one roof, nor ever dwell with her.' (414)</span><br />
<br />
<span id="415">'O son, speak not on this wise of thy wife,<br />
For wise is Isidāsī and discreet,<br />
An early riser and a housewife diligent.<br />
Say, doth she find no favour in thine eyes?' (415)</span><br />
<br />
<span id="416">'In nothing doth she work me harm, and yet<br />
With Isidāsī will I never live.<br />
I cannot suffer her. Let be, let be!<br />
Give ye me leave and I will go away.' (416)</span><br />
<span id="417">And when they heard, mother and father-in-law<br />
Asked of me: 'What then hast thou done t' offend?<br />
Speak to us freely, child, and speak the truth.' (417)</span><br />
<br />
<span id="418">'Naught have I done that could offend, nor harm,<br />
Nor nagged at evil words. What can I do,</span> <a href="pos20.htm#159-1"><sup>401</sup></a><br />
That me my husband should so sore mislike?' (418)<br />
<br />
<span id="419">To guard and keep their son, they took me back,<br />
Unwilling guides, to father's house, distressed,<br />
Distraught: 'Alas! we're beaten, pretty Luck!'</span> <a href="pos20.htm#159-2"><sup>402</sup></a> (419)<br />
<br />
<span id="420">Then father gave me for the second time as bride,<br />
Content with half my husband's sire had paid. (420)</span><br />
<span id="421">From that house too, when I had dwelt a month,<br />
I was sent back, though I had worked and served,<br />
Blameless and virtuous, as any slave. (421)</span><br />
<span id="422">And yet a third, a friar begging alms–<br />
One who had self controlled, and could control<br />
Favour in fellow-men–my father met<br />
And spake him thus: 'Be thou my son-in-law!<br />
Come, throw away that ragged robe and pot!' (422)</span><br />
<span id="423">He came, and so we dwelt one half moon more<br />
Together. Then to father thus he spake:<br />
'O give me back my frock, my bowl and cup.<br />
Let me away to seek once more my scraps.' (423)</span><br />
<span id="424">Then to him father, mother, all the tribe<br />
Of kinsfolk clamouring: 'What is it then<br />
Here dwelling likes you not? Say quick, what is't<br />
That we can do to make you better pleased?' (424)</span><br />
<span id="425">Then he: 'If for myself I can suffice,<br />
Enough for me. One thing I know:–beneath<br />
One roof with Isidāsī I'll not live!' (425)</span><br />
<br />
<span id="426">Dismissed he went. I too, alone I thought.<br />
And then I asked my parents' leave to die,<br />
Or, that they suffer me to leave the world. (426)</span><br />
<span id="427">Now Lady Jinadattā on her beat<br />
Came by my father's house for daily alms,<br />
Mindful of every moral precept, she,<br />
Learnèd and expert in the Vinaya.</span> <a href="pos20.htm#160-1"><sup>403</sup></a> (427)<br />
<span id="428">And seeing her we rose, and I prepared<br />
A seat for her, and as she sat I knelt,<br />
Then gave her food, both boiled and dried, (428)</span><br />
<span id="429">And water–dishes we had set aside–<br />
And satisfied her hunger. Then I said:<br />
'Lady, I wish to leave the world.' 'Why here,' (429)</span><br />
<span id="430">My father said, 'dear child, is scope for thee<br />
To walk according to the Norm. With food<br />
And drink canst gratify the holy folk<br />
And the twice-born.</span> <a href="pos20.htm#161-1"><sup>404</sup></a> But of my father I, (430)<br />
<span id="431">Weeping and holding out clasped hands, besought:<br />
'Nay, but the evil karma I have done,<br />
That would I expiate and wear away.'</span><a href="pos20.htm#161-2"><sup>405</sup></a> (431)<br />
<span id="432">Then father said: 'Win thou Enlightenment<br />
And highest Truth, and gain Nibbana.<br />
That Hath He, the Best of Beings,</span> <a href="pos20.htm#161-3"><sup>406</sup></a> realized.' (432)<br />
<br />
<span id="433">Then to my mother and my father dear,<br />
And all my kinsfolk tribe I bade farewell.<br />
And only seven days had I gone forth<br />
Ere I had touched and won the Threefold Lore. (433)</span><br />
<span id="434">Then did I come to know my former births,<br />
E'en seven thereof, and how e'en now I reap<br />
The harvest, the result, that then I sowed.<br />
That will I now declare to thee, an thou<br />
Wilt listen single-minded to my tale. (434)</span><br />
<br />
<span id="435">In Erakaccha's</span> <a href="pos20.htm#161-4"><sup>407</sup></a> town of yore l lived,<br />
A wealthy craftsman in all works of gold.<br />
Incensed by youth's hot blood, a wanton, I<br />
Assailed the virtue of my neighbours' wives. (435)<br />
<span id="436">Therefrom deceasing, long I cooked</span> <a href="pos20.htm#162-1"><sup>408</sup></a> in hell,<br />
Till, fully ripened, I emerged, and then<br />
Found rebirth in the body of an ape. (436)<br />
<span id="437">Scarce seven days I lived before the great<br />
Dog-ape, the monkeys' chief, castrated me.<br />
Such was the fruit of my lasciviousness. (437)</span><br />
<span id="438">Therefrom deceasing in the woods of Sindh,<br />
Reborn the offspring of a one-eyed goat (438)</span><br />
<span id="439">And lame; twelve years a gelding, gnawn by worms,<br />
Unfit, I carried children on my back.<br />
Such was the fruit of my lasciviousness. (439)</span><br />
<span id="440">Therefrom deceasing, I again found birth,<br />
The offspring of a cattle-dealer's cow,<br />
A calf of lac-red hue; in the twelfth month (440)</span><br />
<span id="441">Castrated, yoked, I drew the plough and cart,<br />
Purblind and worried, driven and unfit.<br />
Such was the fruit of my lasciviousness. (441)</span><br />
<span id="442">Therefrom deceasing, even in the street<br />
I came to birth, child of a household slave,<br />
Neither of woman nor of man my sex.<br />
Such was the fruit of my lasciviousness. (442)</span><br />
<span id="443">At thirty years of age I died, and was reborn<br />
A girl, the daughter of a carter, poor<br />
And of ill-fortune, and oppressed with debts<br />
Incurred to usurers. To pay the sum (443)</span><br />
<span id="444">Of interest that ever grew and swelled,<br />
In place of money,</span> <a href="pos20.htm#162-2"><sup>409</sup></a> woeful little me<br />
The merchant of a caravan dragged off,<br />
Bearing me weeping from my home. (444)<br />
<span id="445">Now in my sixteenth year, when I<br />
Blossomed a maiden, that same merchant's son,<br />
Giridāsa the name of him, loved me<br />
And made me wife. Another wife he had, (445)</span><br />
<span id="446">A virtuous dame of parts and of repute,<br />
Enamoured of her mate. And thus I brought<br />
Discord and enmity within that house. (446)</span><br />
<br />
<span id="447">Fruit of my karma was it thus that they,<br />
In this last life, have slighted me, e'en tho'<br />
I waited on them as their humble slave.<br />
<br />
Well! of all that now have I made an end! (447)</span></p></td>
