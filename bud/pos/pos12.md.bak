## <span id="C-VII">CANTO VII PSALMS OF SEVEN VERSES</span>

### <span id="LVIII">LVIII Uttarā.</span>

S<span class="small">HE</span>, too, having made her resolve under
former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this and
that rebirth, so that in her the root of good (karma) was well planted,
and the requisites for emancipation were well stored up, was, in this
Buddha-era, reborn at Sāvatthī, in a certain clansman's family, and
called Uttarā. Come to years of discretion, she heard Paṭācārā preach
the Norm, became thereby a believer, entered the Order, and became an
Arahant. And, reflecting on her attainment, she exulted thus:

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong></strong>
<p><span id="175">'Men in their prime, with pestle and with quern<br />
Are busied pounding rice and grinding corn.<br />
Men in their prime gather and heap up wealth,<br />

<span id="176">Yours is the task to spend yourselves upon<br />

<span id="178">The will of her who spake–Paṭācārā–<br />

Long memories of the bygone line of lives.<br />

<span id="180">While passed the third watch of the night, I burst<br />
And rent aside the gloom of ignorance.<br />
<br />

<span id="181">And like to Sakka o'er the thrice ten gods,<br />
Chieftain unconquered in celestial wars,<br />
I place thee as my chief, and so shall live.<br />

From deadly drugs my soul is purified.' (181)</span></p></td>

Now this Sister, one day, when under Paṭācārā she had established
herself in an exercise, went into her own dwelling, and seating herself
cross-legged, thought: 'I will not break up this sitting until I have
emancipated my heart from all dependence on the Āsavas.' Thus resolving,
she incited her intellectual grasp, and gradually clarifying insight as
she progressed along the Paths, she attained Arahantship, together with
the power of intuition and thorough grasp of the Norm. Thus
contemplating nineteen subjects [<sup>289</sup>](pos12.htm#95-1.md) in
succession, with the consciousness that 'Now have I done what herein I
had to do,' she uttered in her happiness the verses given above, and
stretched her limbs. And when the dawn arose, and night brightened into
day, she sought the Therī's presence, and repeated her verses.

### <span id="LIX">LIX Cālā.</span>

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up
good of age-enduring efficacy in subsequent rebirths, was, in this
Buddha-era, reborn in Magadha, at the village of Nālaka,
[<sup>290</sup>](pos12.htm#96-1.md) the child of Surūpasārī, the Brahminee.
And on her name-giving day they called her Cālā.
[<sup>291</sup>](pos12.htm#96-2.md) Her younger sister was Upacālā, and the
youngest Sīsūpacālā, and all three were junior to their brother
Sāriputta, Captain of the Norm. Now, when the three heard that their
brother had left the world for the Order, they said: 'This can be no
ordinary system, nor ordinary renunciation, if one like our brother have
followed it!' And full of desire and longing, they too renounced the
world, putting aside their weeping kinsfolk and attendants. Thereupon,
with striving and endeavour, they attained Arahantship, and abode in the
bliss of Nibbana.

Now, Cālā Bhikkhunī, after her round and her meal, entered one day the
Dark Grove to take siesta. Then Māra came to stir up sensual desires in
her. Is it not told in the Sutta?

Again, Cālā Bhikkhunī, after her round in Sāvatthi and her meal, entered
one day the Pleasant Grove for siesta. And, going on down into the Dark
Grove, she sat down under a tree. Then Māra came, and, wishing to upset
the consistency of her religious life, asked her the questions in her
Psalm. When she had expounded to him the virtues of the Master, and the
guiding power of the Norm, she showed him how, by her own attained
proficiency, he was exceeding his tether. Thereat Māra, dejected and
melancholy, vanished. But she discoursed in exultation on what both of
them had said, as follows:

### <span id="LX">LX Upacālā.</span>

Her story has been told in the foregoing number. Like Cālā, she, too, as
Arahant, exulted, after Māra had tempted her in vain, as follows:
