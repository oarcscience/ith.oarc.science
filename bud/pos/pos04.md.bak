## <span id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</span>

I

B<span class="small">OOK</span> titles are necessarily brief. In their
brevity they seem to claim too much and to specify not enough. Here and
now let the title of this little volume be modified by the ampler
designation: Verses attributed, in the tradition of the Pali Canon, to
certain eminent Sisters (Therī-Bhikkhunīs) of the Buddhist Order, and
forming the second and smaller portion of the work entitled
*Thera-therī-gāthā–i.e.* verses of the Elders, Brethren and Sisters.

No one, not even, I imagine, a pious Buddhist, believes that these
verses contain the *ipsissima verba* of those members of the Order to
whom they are ascribed, or that these notable adherents conversed in
Pali *ślokas*. We shall never get at the quantum of historic fact that
there may be in the tradition, nor even know how many of the Elders here
named ever really existed. Nor does it very much matter. The historical
fact that we here have and hold is the record, that just the sentiments
and the aspirations, which are expressed in this work, have been for so
many centuries, and by a very considerable communion of followers,
attributed to saintly men and women co-operating in the building up of
certain ideals; and also that the *logia* should, as such, have been
incorporated in a literature so long preserved, cherished, and revered
as 'holy writ.' The registration of such views; the reverence accorded
to such views; these are for the history of human ideas the really
precious truths, however legendary or lost the genuine sources may have
become.

The poems or verses so preserved to us are included in the Fifth Group
of the second of the Three Pitakas (the Sutta-Pitaka) in the Pali
Canon–the Group entitled Short: *Khud'dăkă-Nikāya*–and ranged after the
Four *Nikāyas* often quoted in the following pages: *Dīgha, Majjhima,
Saŋyutt'a, Angutt'ără*. The poems were edited with scholarly excellence
in 1883 for the Pali Text Society,[<sup>1</sup>](pos04.htm#xiv-1.md) then
in the third year of its existence. Professor H. Oldenberg, now of
Göttingen, was responsible for the verses of the Theras, or Elder
Brethren. The late Professor R. Pischel, of Berlin, edited those of the
Therīs, or Elder Women. The Brethren's Gāthās number 264, those of the
Sisters, 73. Those of the Brethren come first. Bhikkhus formed the great
majority in the Order, and, in standing and position, ranked senior to
the Bhikkhunīs. The prior appearance of a translation of the latter part
of the book is due, not to a wish to improve upon the ancient order, but
to an accidental circumstance in the supply of materials. I refer to the
Commentary on the *Thera-therī-gāthā*, and will turn aside to deal with
it.

The gāthās, or stanzas, edited as above described, stand, as for nearly
twenty centuries they have stood in the palm-leaf MSS. of the
Sutta-Pitaka–that is to say, without any accompanying Commentary. In an
Appendix, however, to his edition of the *Therī-gāthā*, Professor
Pischel gave numerous extracts from Dhammapāla's Commentary on those
verses. Ten years later this Commentary on the *Therī-gāthā*, together
with its copious extracts from the *Apadāna*–the *Vitæ Sanctorum* of the
Buddhist Canon–was published by the Pali Text Society in Professor
Edward Müller's edition. [<sup>2</sup>](pos04.htm#xiv-2.md) But, for some
reason or other, the MSS. of the preceding portion of Dhammapāla's
Commentary [<sup>3</sup>](pos04.htm#xiv-3.md) –that on the
*Thera-gāthā*–are not so numerous, or at least not so easily obtained as
is the Commentary on the Sisters' verses, or the other parts of the
work. At present I have heard of but one copy in Europe, now lent to the
India Office on my behalf by the Royal Library of Copenhagen, and that
is neither a good nor a complete copy. My wants have now been better
supplied by a copy purchased in Burma through the kind exertions of
Professor Charles Duroiselle, of Rangoon College–a copy that he was able
to procure without arranging for a special copy to be made at a Wihāra
library. Had it not been for the lamentable deadlock of the
long-promised Siamese printed edition of the Commentaries, a translation
of the Brethren's verses might have preceded this volume.

This indeed has been the case in Dr. K. E. Neumann's vivid and vigorous,
if at times somewhat free, translation of the *Thera-therī-gāthā*, into
German verse. [<sup>4</sup>](pos04.htm#xv-1.md) He translated without the
aid of any commentary on the Brothers' verses (a task bristling with
difficulties), and with a 'thorough scepticism' as to the value of the
commentarial chronicle about the Sisters. And in view of the shortness
of life and the length of literatures, there is no doubt much to justify
immediate translation of what we have, instead of waiting, to enrich and
improve our work, for materials that we have not yet. To what extent
such materials as I wait for do enrich and improve, the educated reader
of past, present, and future translations must judge. If he is not
acquainted with the tradition of the Buddhist Commentary, here it is in
outline.

Whatever be the story of the Canon's evolution, while it had oral being
only, it stands recorded that the Pali Canon was committed to writing in
80 <span class="small">B. C.</span> Down to and after this date, the
*Attha-kathā*, or 'talk about the contents, meaning, or purpose' of the
work in question, was a matter of traditional convention, which
individual expounding Bhikkhus or Bhikkhunīs might tell in more or less
their own words. And when the Attha-kathā was about a Gāthā, the two
together formed an Akkhāna (Sanskrit=*Ākhyāna*), a record or story in
mixed prose and verse. The great work of the Jātaka or Birth-stories
[<sup>5</sup>](pos04.htm#xvi-1.md) is a notable instance of this.

About 80 <span class="small">B. C.</span>, then, the Psalms
[<sup>6</sup>](pos04.htm#xvi-2.md) were committed to writing. But in the
fifth or sixth century <span class="small">A. D.</span>, either before
or just after Buddhaghosa had flourished, and written his great
commentaries on the prose works of the Vinaya and Sutta Pitakas,
Dhammapāla of Kāñcipura (now Conjevaram, Madras Presidency), wrote down
in Pali [<sup>7</sup>](pos04.htm#xvi-3.md) the unwritten expository
material constituting the then extant three Attha-katha's
[<sup>8</sup>](pos04.htm#xvi-4.md) on the Psalms, and incorporated it into
his commentary on three other books of the Canon, naming the whole
'Paramattha-dīpanī,' or Elucidation of the Ultimate Meaning. He not only
gives the *ākhyāna* in each Psalm, but adds a paraphrase, in the Pali of
his day, of the more archaic idiom in which the *gāthās* were compiled,
as well as the Apadāna citations alluded to
above.[<sup>9</sup>](pos04.htm#xvi-5.md)

All this, if read in a properly critical spirit, and with mindfulness of
the effect of transmission and the long-time intervals on exegetists not
versed in the canons of evidence and historical criticism, is of
considerable help, both to the text editor, and to the translator, and
to the reader. Professor Pischel has recorded, magnanimously modest, the
help he derived from Dhammapāla, help of which his distinguished
colleague and co-editor was, for nearly one-half of his editorial work,
deprived for the reason already stated. To myself the Commentary has
been indispensable. Without accepting in blind faith the accuracy of the
synonyms or equipollent phrases supplied in its exegesis, I have, in
many ambiguous terms, been determined by the ruling of the Commentator,
as representing the most ancient orthodox tradition. Again, it will be
seen that the gāthās often record different episodes in one and the same
career, or the utterances of different persons whose identity has at
times to be guessed at.

Now, the Commentator's explanations of episode and speaker are, it is
true, legends woven out of legends. In the first place, of the
seventy-one Sisters [<sup>10</sup>](pos04.htm#xvii-1.md) to whom poems are
attributed, we only meet with twenty in other works of the Pali Canon.
The poems of half as many again are repeated in the Apadāna, but the
names of the putative compilers do not always agree. A similar want of
agreement between name and poem appears in the Saŋyutta version of
certain of the Psalms given here in an [Appendix](pos22.htm#APPENDIX.md).
Hence it is only for a very limited section of the Psalms that we can,
with any fraction of confidence, associate a given gāthā with a putative
poetess for whom something approaching historical personality may be
claimed. This does not, of course, warrant the conclusion that the
majority of Sisters named as authors of gāthās, but of whom nothing is
elsewhere recorded, never existed. But the fact that, in the
*Therī-gāthā* and *Saŋyutta Nikāya* versions of certain gāthās, there is
a discrepancy in five out of ten poems between poem and assigned
author,[<sup>11</sup>](pos04.htm#xvii-2.md) shows us that, if the verses
were carefully preserved, the identity of the authors had, for the
preservers, something of a Shakespearian or Homeric indefiniteness. And
the fact, again, that in seventeen of the poems the Therīgāthā assigns
one author's name, the Apadāna another, increases our want of
confidence.

To this legendary status of the Therīs, as historical realities, we have
to add the accumulated growth round their names of legend and myth
revealed in the commentarial chronicle. For this growth Dhammapāla must
not be held responsible. Its rate of progress had been much quicker. The
canonical Apadāna, in its metrical tales of thirty-three of the Therīs,
reveals their pre-natal legend already full grown. Besides, Dhammapāla
drew his materials from three older Commentaries, as he himself admits.
Now, even if we so stretch our less copious imagination as to concede to
a few highly-gifted persons, just 'then' and 'there,' the supernormal
power of visualizing that which they *judged* to be their own antecedent
personalities in previous lives, there is no record whatever of Therīs,
who claimed so to remember, recounting these reminiscences to their
contemporaries. To this rule of reticence in divulging there are two
marked exceptions. These are the last two poems, those of
[Isidāsī](pos20.htm#LXXII) and [Sumedhā](pos21.htm#LXXIII.md), poems which,
more than all the rest, suggest later literary craft, and, like the last
few, bear the impress, not of traditional sayings handed down, but of
deliberate literary creation.

Even apart from the, to us, mythological traditions attaching to each
Sister, the record of her final rebirth does not always show signs that
the scenes where she moved were, for the chronicler or for his
authorities, *choses vues*. In one story we find the classic
Gijjha-kūti, or Vulture's Peak, above Rājagaha, moved, apparently, to
Sāvatthī. At Sāvatthī, too, is the Buddha found, while he is said to be
preaching on the banks of the Nerañjarā in Magadha. And there are more
such little 'faults,' geologically speaking.

But when all of that ilk is said and considered, the Western reader may
still judge it well that the Psalms have been here presented along with,
not in isolation from, their ancient if less venerable chronicle. All
who are capable of a *historical* sympathy–of an appreciation, that is,
of ideas as evolving in time–will be glad to see somewhat of the
age-long traditions in which these rare and remarkable utterances have
been set and fostered in so venerable a literature as that of the Pali
manuscripts. Strangers to Christianity would have no conception of how
profoundly the traditions grouped about the persons of the Virgin Mother
and the Magdalene have permeated its history, who only knew the pale
etchings of these women in the Gospels. Enshrined in the casket of
legends constructed by the loving piety of centuries, these little poems
of the Therīs take life and breath and colour. Whether the verses in
search of an owner have perchance missed their way, whether, indeed, in
some of the first few stanzas a name may not have been created to fit
the words, still may we see, in this dream-pageant of Sisters of the
antique world conjured up for us by the chronicler, the reiterated
testimony to high quest, to devoted heart, to indomitable resolve.

The last-named feature, that of the Resolve and its persistent efficacy
throughout rebirths, is of special interest. It is not characteristic of
the earlier doctrine, but in Mahāyānist Buddhism, we find it taken up
and elaborated, from the Hīnayānism of the *Nidānakathā*,
[<sup>12</sup>](pos04.htm#xix-1.md) and of our Commentator into the
Praṇidhāna's, or aspirations of persistent effect, formed when, in any
human being, the *bodhicitta* (or heart of intelligence) awakes and
transforms him into a nascent Bodhisatva.

But leaving the Commentary and reverting to the gāthās, it is very
possible–nay, probable–that in all but the poems of a single śloka, and
in some of two or three ślokas, later work of compilation may have been
wrought on brief runes landed down from the beginning as the utterances
of contemporaries of the founders of Buddhism. Another important and
ancient canonical work–the *Sutta Nipāta*–would appear to have been thus
threaded together. [<sup>13</sup>](pos04.htm#xix-2.md) It is not, of
course, claimed that the Sisters, or any other notable Buddhists, spoke,
however briefly, in blank verse; but it is held that, in early
literatures, *spoken utterances* are ever the earliest records to be put
in metrical form. And the Pali of practically all the *Therī-gāthā* is
of ancient type. Moreover, under social conditions such as prevailed
where and when Buddhism took its rise, that is to say, where there was
considerable intellectual activity, but where writing was not used to
register its products, there would be a tendency to convert with little
delay all utterances deemed worth memorializing into metrical form.

Some of these metrical memorial utterances appear as the common property
of several Sisters.[<sup>14</sup>](pos04.htm#xx-1.md) Once composed, it is
quite conceivable that certain Sisters may have made frequent use of
them in teaching and preaching. They may thus have become more
associated with the memoirs of those Sisters than with the tradition
attaching to others, whether the Sisters in question actually composed
them or not. And where two or more detached stanzas were handed down,
thus linked to the memory and tradition of one name, some member or
members of the Sangha–man or woman, or both–of literary gifts may have
welded them together, more or less, when the Canon was being arranged
and becoming a closed work. An excellent instance of such a collection
of detached gāthās, where no organic welding has been attempted, is that
of Uppalavaṇṇā ([Ps. lxiv](pos16.htm#LXIV)..md). Here are four episodes
grouped about a name that occurs more frequently in Pali romance than
any other woman's name.[<sup>15</sup>](pos04.htm#xx-2.md) The Therī is held
up by the Buddha, according to *Saŋyutta Nikāya*, ii. 236, linked with
another Therī, Khemā ([Ps. lii](pos11.htm#LII)..md), as the standard and
limit of what a woman in holy orders ought to be. But in the *Vinaya*, a
Bhikkhunī, Uppalavaṇṇā, is thrice quoted in a connection that reveals
her twice as an instance of a woman attractive to the other sex, and
once as a student of weak memory. Another name, too, that of Ummādantī
(enchantress), is mixed up with her legend. Hence the great Therī of
supernormal power is as difficult to identify as our own St. George, and
it is not strange that her gāthā should be composite.

The gāthā of Kisāgotamī ([Ps. lxiii](pos15.htm#LXIII)..md) is another
interesting case of possibly later work of welding. Here the tragedy of
Sister Paṭācārā's life, no mention of which is made in the brief poem
bearing her name ([Ps. xlvii](pos10.htm#XLVII)..md), is woven into the
Psalm called after Kisā-gotamī. And the fine summary of woman's 'woeful
lot' is preceded by another brief episode on *kalyāṇamittatā*, or
friendship with the good and lovable (κaλoκάγaθoί). It is very probable
from inspection of the poem (and chronicle), that of two poems
attributed to Paṭācārā, one recounting her sufferings, given in the
Apadāna and *quoted* in the Commentary, has been lost, or merged with
that of Kisā-gotamī. It is also probable that the latter, if it
introduces a gāthā already existing alluding to Paṭācārā, is of later
date than this gāthā.

When we come to the last seven poems we find, not larger congeries of
fragmentary sayings, but only homogeneous structure. The type approaches
that of the ballad [<sup>16</sup>](pos04.htm#xxi-1.md) or the incipient
drama, or is a consecutive symmetrical monologue (Ambapālī, lxvi.). None
of the putative authors, save Ambapālī, is an historical personage. And
her poem is a type-lyric, not a personal document. It may have been
composed by anyone of poetic gifts, and concerning ageing beauty in the
abstract. Here, then, there is no question of sparse verses welded
together and collectively ascribed to an age-dimmed, but very possibly
genuine, personage. Either the Sisters in question composed these longer
effusions, or they did not. According to Pischel,
[<sup>17</sup>](pos04.htm#xxi-2.md) 'we have reason to suppose that' the
ballads of Cāpā and Sundarī ([Ps. lxviii](pos18.htm#LXVIII.md),
[lxix](pos18.htm#LXIX)..md) 'are very old compositions,' because 'they bear
the stamp of the oldest Indian ākhyāna as described by Professor
Oldenberg.'[<sup>18</sup>](pos04.htm#xxii-1.md)

But in the case of the last two Psalms, there are features pointing to
different and possibly later conditions attending their compilation.
[Isidāsī's poem](pos20.htm#LXXII.md), for one who comes to it steeped in
the phraseology of the preceding Psalms, strikes a strangely varied,
almost a discordant note. The scene is Patna, a city rising on the
decline of the Kosalan and Magadhese capitals, let alone that of Kāsī
(Benāres). The wretched girl's plea to join the Order of Bhikkhunīs
might be that of a Jain, so Jainistic is her aspiration.
[<sup>19</sup>](pos04.htm#xxii-2.md) The name of her sponsor
Bhikkhunī–Jinadattā–which does not occur elsewhere in the Canon, is
possibly significant. In the opening stanzas the work of editorial
hands, as if dealing with less familiar material, is frankly admitted by
Dhammapāla. Sumedhā's aspirations, on the other hand, have the older
orthodox ring, even though often clad in different phraseology. But her
harangues, differing in their copious flow from the severe and reticent
terseness of the majority of poems, are sermons *preached from a Bible:*
'Remember,' she cries, 'this parable and remember that!'
[<sup>20</sup>](pos04.htm#xxii-3.md) as if the Nikāyas had already
crystallized into shape. And where, in either Psalm, is the
all-pervading influence of 'the Master' as a living presence?

How far editors of the earlier and authors of the later poems were
identical, we shall never know. The canonical books are all, with one
exception, [<sup>21</sup>](pos04.htm#xxii-4.md) of too early a date to be
claimed by any one author. 'They were the result rather of communistic
than of individual effort.' [<sup>22</sup>](pos04.htm#xxii-5.md) There is
sufficient variety of style in all the longer poems, even though some of
these are more mutually alike than others, for more than one author. As
to the authors' sex, the genuine artist in words can give expression,
with sympathy and verisimilitude, to the heart of man or woman. There
seems, for all that, no sufficient warrant for Dr. Neumann's assumption
that the poems of the Sisters, let alone those of the Brothers, 'must
have been shaped by . . . a man.' [<sup>23</sup>](pos04.htm#xxiii-1.md) Not
often since the patriarchal age set in has woman succeeded in so
breaking through her barriers as to set on lasting record the expression
of herself and of things as they appeared to her. But to assume that,
because this happened seldom, therefore, this collection of documents,
though ascribed to her, [<sup>24</sup>](pos04.htm#xxiii-2.md) are
necessarily not by her, is to carry over far the truth: 'He that hath,
to him shall be given, and she that hath not, from her shall be taken
even that which she hath!' I make no counter-assumption that gifted
Therīs had a hand in the compilation of the Brothers' Psalms. I would
only ask English readers to await the appearance of those, and note the
interesting differences in idiom, sentiment and tone between them and
the Sisters' Psalms. Even the 'common stock' of refrains is different,
the only exceptions being that of

> *kataŋ Buddhassa sāsanaŋ,  
> tisso vijjā anuppattā,  
> *

and  

> *n'atthi 'dāni punabbhavo.* [<sup>25</sup>](pos04.htm#xxiii-3.md)

II

However, it lies with future historians of the Pali Canon as a whole to
deal with these baffling questions. By whomsoever compiled, the contents
of the Psalms are profoundly and perennially interesting as expressions
of the religious mind, universal and unconquerable; a mind which is so
intensely *alive*, because, to quote R. L. Stevenson, 'it knows what it
prefers, instead of humbly saying Amen! to what the world tells it it
ought to prefer.' Even in the shorter gāthās we may eliminate the common
stock of refrains, and yet discern, in each residuum, a distinctly and
pathetically individual note, telling its own story of a supreme
'conjuncture' seized, of Nibbana (in its later Sanskrit form, *Nirvāṇā*)
or Arahantship won.

More interesting, to the social historian, than the peace they hymned is
the account of the various motives that drove women, when Buddhism had
arisen, from the world to embrace the *an-agāriyā* or homeless life.
These motives are as diverse as those revealed in the records of
Christian monasticism. Across time and space a common humanity is
manifest. In some cases it is the drawing power of the Dhamma, preached
by the Buddha, or by a senior disciple of either sex, which brings about
the crisis. The mental upheaval or commotion (*saŋvega*) produced in the
hearer is occasioned, not so much by a 'sense of sin,' as by the flash
of insight into universal impermanence in all things human and divine,
and by the prospect of being reborn, world without end, in the infinite
chain of life, ever renewing itself in the resultants of its own acts.

In other cases it is the *vis a tergo* of goading circumstance that
impels the woman to break out of the groove. Escape, deliverance,
freedom from suffering mental, moral, domestic, social–from some
situation that has become intolerable–is hymned in the verses and
explained in the Commentary. The bereaved mother, the childless widow,
are emancipated from grief and contumely; the Magdalen from remorse, the
wife of raja or rich man from the satiety and emptiness of an idle life
of luxury, the poor man's wife from care and drudgery, the young girl
from the humiliation of being handed over to the suitor who bids
highest, the thoughtful woman from the ban imposed upon her intellectual
development by convention and tradition. It is a suggestive point that
the percentage of Sisters' Psalms, in which the goal achieved is
envisaged as Emancipation, Liberty won–about 23 per cent.–is
considerably greater than the corresponding proportion in the Psalms by
the Brethren (13 per cent.). In most cases, the male singer had had the
disposal of his life in his own hands to a greater extent than was the
case with each woman. I do not so misread the poems as to conclude that
the liberty they hymned was merely a shaking off the trammels of the
'House-life.' As a novelist of to-day sagaciously puts it: 'Only the
selfish and the useless are ever free.' [<sup>26</sup>](pos04.htm#xxv-1.md)
'C<span class="small">ITTAŊ</span> *vimucci me!*'–it was the freed mind,
the release from sense, superstition, craving, and the round of rebirth
that made them break forth into singing. All other escape was but the
*anagārūpanissaya*, [<sup>27</sup>](pos04.htm#xxv-2.md) the indispensable
conditions of the final release. Nevertheless, these little women of old
were every whit as human as we, and I am convinced that the glory of
saintship was for them, and at first–when they hymned it–no white light,
but prismatic through the circumstances and temperament of each. Thus,
those who had had most ado in breaking away from the world were most
likely to sing:

> 'O free indeed! O gloriously free am
> I!'[<sup>28</sup>](pos04.htm#xxv-3.md)

and to climb alone and sit on rocky peak, where the keener air smote on
their brow and the world grew wide beneath, while they mused on this
good thing that had come to them:

>                     'So sit I here  
> Upon the rock. And o'er my spirit sweeps  
> The breath of L<span class="small">IBERTY!</span>'
> [<sup>29</sup>](pos04.htm#xxv-4.md)

To gain this free mobility, *pace* the deeper liberty, they, like their
later Christian sisters, had laid down all social position, all domestic
success; they had lost their world. But in exchange they had won the
status of an individual in place of being adjuncts, however much
admired, fostered, and sheltered they might, as such, have been. 'With
shaven head, wrapt in their robe'–a dress indistinguishable, it would
seem, from the swathing toga and swathed under-garments of the male
*religieux*–the Sister was free to come and go, to dive alone into the
depths of the wood, or climb aloft.

Moreover, to free mobility she could wed the other austere joy of being
recognized, at least by her brother 'Arahants,' as a rational being,
without reference to sex. As such she breathed the spiritual atmosphere,
she shared the intellectual communion of that religious aristocracy
called in the Pitakas, Ariyas, with whom she claimed that power of
'seeing all things as they really are' (*i.e.*, have come to be, *sabbaŋ
yathābhūtaŋ disvā*), which the Buddhist called being Awake (*buddho*).

> '*How should the woman's nature hinder Us–*

us Ariyas?' says Somā:

> *'What can that signify to one in whom  
> Insight doth truly comprehend the Norm?  
> To one for whom the question doth arise:  
> Am I a woman in such matters, or  
> Am I a, man? or what not am I, then?–  
> To such an one is Māra fit to talk!'*

It is true that the Bhikkhunīs were, technically, appointed juniors in
perpetuity to the Bhikkhus. It is equally clear that, by intellectual
and moral eminence, a Therī might claim equality with the highest of the
fraternity. In the Psalms an instance occurs, in
[xxxvii](pos09.htm#XXXVII.md)., where Bhaddā associates herself in
spiritual attainment with the great Kassapa, successor, as head of the
Order, to the Founder himself.

Not less touching than the sacrifices made for their dual liberty by
rebels of the hearth are the few brief utterances of women who saw the
land of freedom, but who repressed their longing to 'go forth,' even for
many years, so long as duties to those depending on them kept them at
home. To these the late-won liberty comes more as a haven of rest, and
the poem a welcome spoken to her by the Master himself:

> *'Happily rest, thou venerable dame,  
> Rest thee . . . knowing Nibbana's peace.'*
> [<sup>30</sup>](pos04.htm#xxvi-1.md)

It is worthy of passing note that these hindrances are chronicled as
having been duties owed to husband, parent, or master, but never to
children. If the mother's need is so great that she wrenches herself
away from her children, either it is recorded that the child is handed
over to grandparents, or the fact of the sacrifice is merely stated:

> *'Home have I left, for I have left my world!  
> Child have I left, and all my cherished herds.'*
> [<sup>31</sup>](pos04.htm#xxvii-1.md)

Whatever the mother's feelings may have been in such cases–and there are
but one or two of them occurring in the book–the custom of the sons
continuing to live with their parents after marriage seems to have been
so prevalent that the children would not have been left unmothered. In
nearly every case of a matron leaving the world, either no children are
mentioned, or they are provided for, or grown up, or Death is mothering
them.

For if Freedom drew, not less did Sorrow drive.

> *'Woeful is woman's lot! hath He declared–  
> Tamer and Driver of the hearts of men;'*

and there are many erstwhile broken-hearted women who, in these verses,
tell of how they had found consolation. One noteworthy point is that,
not only is there not the faintest suggestion of *suttee*, there is no
case even of the widow so greatly mourning the loss of her husband as
one beloved that she seeks comfort at the Master's feet. Where her
'lord' [<sup>32</sup>](pos04.htm#xxvii-2.md) leaves her to enter the
religious life, she follows in emulation, and enters it with the
Bhikkhunīs; but if she be widowed, she mourns either her impoverished
lot, or she is, as it happens, mourning for a child, or for kinsfolk, at
the same time. It is 'Rachel weeping for her children because they are
not' that constitutes, far more than does the bereaved daughter, sister,
wife, or widow, as such, the type of Mulier Dolorosa–

> *'Cuius animam gementem  
> Contristantem et dolentem  
>    Pertransivit gladius'–*

to whom life in the Order came chiefly as comfort and support in mortal
anguish.

The 'Light of Asia' has familiarized the West with the episode, narrated
in our Commentary, of Kisāgotamī–the Frail
Gotamid[<sup>33</sup>](pos04.htm#xxviii-1.md)–who, cheating her distracted
mind, sought medicine for the little child she bore about, dead, on her
hip. The poem ascribed to her is one of the most striking of the series.
Released from all her sorrows by insight gained through communion in the
Order 'with noble souls,' and chiefly through the object-lesson given
her by the noblest of them all, she strikes in her verses a broader
note. Into the echoes of her own grief she weaves the chords of the
sufferings of her sex, and more especially the terrible experiences of
her great colleague the Sister
Paṭācārā,[<sup>34</sup>](pos04.htm#xxviii-2.md) as if to illustrate the
teaching of him who had comforted her, namely, that 'there hath no
trouble overtaken you save such as is commen to men.'

The Gotamid's swift acceptance of this stoic consolation may call up in
contrast how a Western poet, with insight into human nature, spurns such
comfort for the wounded heart while its anguish is yet raw:

> *'And common was the commonplace,  
> And vacant chaff well meant for grain.  
> That loss is common would not make  
>     My own less bitter, rather more:  
>     Too common! Never morning wore  
> To evening, but some heart did
> break.'*[<sup>35</sup>](pos04.htm#xxviii-3.md)

But it should not be forgotten that Kisāgotamī, distraught though she
was, is represented as being, in her spiritual evolution, at the very
threshold of the Dawn, far nearer to saintship than the young Tennyson,
mourning his friend, claimed to be. It is because he 'saw the promise in
her,' that the Master judged her ready for the test he administered.

This method of consolation receives two developments in the poems. The
former is essentially the agnostic position, and is the theme of
Paṭācārā's own poem of consolation: 'So great a mystery was the little
life now gone, both as to its coming and its going, that it never was
yours–your property–to have or to mourn over. The great laws of the
universe are not worked by you. Be quiet–*und füge dich*.' Thus are many
mothers said to have been effectually comforted. Again we may feel
sceptical, even scornful; but are we sure we have gauged the workings of
all human hearts and every touch to which they will respond? Moreover,
again, these were mothers ripe for salvation.

The other development alluded to is peculiarly Indian: 'No trouble hath
overtaken you, save such as hath already overtaken you many and many a
time in the infinite number of your past spans of life. Why, then, fall
ever back on these helpless tears that never have availed aught? Cut at
the source whence all these myriad bereavements have
come.'[<sup>36</sup>](pos04.htm#xxix-1.md)

Now, apart from their interest as a contribution to the history of women
under Monasticism, the most salient object-lesson given by East to West
in these Psalms is just this characteristic perspective taken of what we
call 'life.' We have heard it said here that life is a moment between
two eternities. But, as a normal attitude of thought, we wipe out the
first eternity, and retain the moment and the forward view. In the
religious language of the Buddhists–to speak only of this phase of
thought–the word life, *jīvita*, hardly occurs. That which we call life
is for them but one *anga*, one segment or stage, in *bhava*, or being
(becoming) Their religious psychology, in the post-Asokan period,
adopted the term *bhavanga* to mean just that moment (one out of an
infinite number of moments) between the eternities, considered more
especially as conscious, or potentially conscious, life, much as our
psychology has adopted the less indigenous word *continuum*.
[<sup>37</sup>](pos04.htm#xxx-1.md) And accordingly, when these weeping
mothers are reminded that times without number have they stood wringing
their hands for the lost burden of sweetness unspeakable–ay, even there,
at Sāvatthī itself, even here, in that charnel-field, even for a girlie
called Jīvā ('living,' 'Viva') too,–even for many Jīvās–why then, for
them at least, whose spiritual growth was just about to show the ripened
fruit, all the intolerable uniqueness of this *last* bereavement fell
away. No more could they say, 'Behold and see if there be any sorrow
like unto my sorrow.' . . . The little moment of their *bhava* and of
the child's *bhava* became merged into the past eternity. And the one
thing needful rose up: How to merge the future eternity into the moment:

> *'. . . had better live no longer than one Day,  
> So she behold, within That Day, That Path!'*

Not without reason may the Western mind of to-morrow object that this
attitude too much resembles the hopeless outlook of the slum-cottage
mother of to-day. She will remark of *her* dozen Jīvās: 'Ah, well, you
must have your lot!' and also, 'As I ought to know, having buried nine!'
To-morrow, it may be, living under physical conditions less horrible
than at present, and with some training of the understanding, she will
rise up and regulate both her 'lot' and let the lot live to bury her.
Yet will one child here and there be torn by death from her. And the
uniqueness will be the more intolerable then–or will she have heard of
Ubbirī?

Thus, anyway, did the Buddha and his elect Sisters seek to comfort
Rachel, administering no celestial balm, but educing from the tottering,
anguished soul its inner resources, its latent self-reliance, its
cramped faculty of spiritual vision. The Christian Bhikkhunī exhorted
her sisters to

> *'Patere nunc aspera.  
> Nunc sis Crucis socia,'*

because they could expect to be

> *'Regni consors postea.'* [<sup>38</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxi-1.md)

The Indian sister was bidden: 'Come to thyself!' and confessed herself
victor over pain and sorrow:

> *'In that I now can grasp and understand  
> The base on which my miseries were built.'*
> [<sup>39</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxi-2.md)

But she is never led to look forward to bliss in terms of *time*,
positive or negative. If Death be conquered, it is not through the
winning, in Arahantship, of eternal living, but because, when Death
comes, his eternally recurring visitation ceases. It may be that in
harping in highest exultation how they had won to, and touched, the Path
Ambrosial–the *Amataŋ Padaŋ*[<sup>40</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxi-3.md)–Nibbana,
they implied some state inconceivable to thought, inexpressible by
language, while the one and the other are limited to concepts and terms
of life; and yet a state which, while not in time or space, positively
constitutes the sequel of the glorious and blissful days of this life's
residuum. Nevertheless, their verses do not seem to betray anything that
can be construed as a consciousness that hidden glories, more wonderful
than the brief span of 'cool' and calm they now know as Arahants, are
awaiting them. There is nothing pointing to an *Avyākata*–an unrevealed
mystery–concerning which 'we would, and if we could,' sing something. It
may be with them as with one who, after long toil and much peril,
reaches home, and is content with that for the day, whatever life may
yet give or ask for on the morrow. They have won up out of the Maelstrom
of Saŋsāra, they have 'crossed over,' they have won to something
ineffable, that *now* is, but is not to be described in terms of space
or after-time; and resting, they sing. We will leave it at that.

In practically every case the breaking out of the groove of habit and
convention was proximately caused by a personal influence–magnetic,
inspiring, persuasive–that of a ransomed sister or brother, or of the
greatest Brother of them all. But herein we note a sharp contrast
between these Indian Marys and their Christian sisters. Where He, the
Central Figure, intervenes, and gratitude is blent with adoration, the
little poem reveals no word of quasi-amorous self-surrender to the
person or image of the Belovèd, such as characterizes not a little of
that Christian literature for which the Song of Solomon–'*I am my
beloved's and my beloved is mine*'–was a sacred archetype. The '*rex
virgineus, sponsus dulcissimus*,' who, in Abbess Herrad's psalm,
'prepares the bridal' and 'receives in his embrace,' belongs to a
tradition naturally evolving around a *youthful* Saviour.
[<sup>41</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxii-1.md) The utmost length a Therī presumes to
go in relating herself to her Teacher, is to claim spiritual fatherhood
in Him, whom she perhaps first saw late in his long life (some of the
Theras, the Brethren, use the same language). Thus Sundarī:

> *'Thou art Buddha! thou art Master! and thine,  
> Thy daughter am I, issue of thy
> mouth.'*[<sup>42</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxii-2.md)

and, again, Uttamā:

> *                 'Buddha's daughter I,  
> Born of his mouth, his blessed word, I stand!'*

And Uppalavaṇṇā:

> *'Thou who presumest to lie in wait for a child of the
> Buddha.'*[<sup>43</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxii-3.md)

While for Kisāgotamī, her great physician enters her Psalm regarded,
though not directly so addressed, more as a kind and noble friend
(*kalyāna-mitta*).

In this connection, it should be noted, that, in Buddhist hagiology,
there is no premium placed on the state of virginity as such. The
Founder himself was a husband and father, and the most eminent Sisters
were, three-fourths of them, matrons, not
virgins.[<sup>44</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxiii-1.md)

It is also worthy of passing remark, that of the four notorious
Magdalens who found peace and purity in the Order of
Bhikkhunīs–Aḍḍhakāsī, Vimalā, Abhaya's Mother, and Ambapālī–not one
expresses any deep feeling of personal attachment to the Teacher. Had
they been of such a temperament, it is probable their past life might
have proved impossible for them.[<sup>45</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxiii-2.md)

Not a less interesting circumstance is it, when the rescued soul's
devotion fastens itself upon a woman saviour, as is shown notably in the
loyalty professed for Paṭācārā, the Great Pajāpatī, Dhammadinnā and
Uppalavaṇṇā. [<sup>46</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxiii-3.md) The last two have
individual acknowledgments paid them, but the first-named–a veritable
*Mater Consolatrix*–is hailed by a school of Bhikkhunīs as their
sovereign Lady

> *'Like unto Sakka o'er the Thrice Ten Gods.'*

Hers is the system or *sāsana* that they obey; the Master himself is not
for them in the foreground of their cult.

From whatever motive and through whatever agency the Sisters had found
their way into the Order, it is clear that with the change a new and
varied life opened up for them. We see in the verses the expression of
energies and emotions newly awakened or diverted into new channels. Even
where the poems breathe rest and peace, their tone is exalted and
hedonistic, telling of

>                        *'exceeding store  
> Of joy and an impassioned
> quietude.'*[<sup>47</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxiv-1.md)

Even in the verses of those women who have sought refuge in the Order
from overwhelming misery or disgust, there is little or no expression of
the obtained relief in terms of that quiescence and apathy and mortified
vitality so readily imputed to the religious ideals of the East. Life
under the Vinaya was one of both active and contemplative discipline.
The emancipation won implied 'space'–*okāsa*–opportunity, that is, for
developing, regulating, and concentrating both thought and deed:

> *'La douce liberté cherchant la douce
> loi.'*[<sup>48</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxiv-2.md)

Under its régime the Bhikkhunī became the pupil of some Therī. She led
the simple life, and discharged the ministering duties of a novice. And
by prescribed exercises and daily lessons she worked out for herself, if
the promise was in her, her own salvation, qualifying to become a
teacher and leader in her turn. There was to be no forgetting by her of
what she had left and escaped from. Not only was she to turn and mark
those past struggles, but, as her insight grew, there was to come to
her, if she was of the calibre of these Therīs, memories of former
lives, revealing the inevitable working of the law of Kamma (karma), or
the conservation of the effect of action. The vision might have its
terrors, but it was all part of her Peace–for had she not made an
end[<sup>49</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxiv-3.md)–an end which all her days meant:

> *                    '. . . peace on earth.  
> Not peace that grows by Lethe, scentless flower,  
>     There in white languors to decline and cease;  
> But peace whose names are also Rapture, Power,  
>     Clear sight and Love: for these are parts of
> Peace.'*[<sup>50</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxv-1.md)

Such are a few of the salient features in these little cameos of
thought, carved by, or for, these notable women of long ago. It would
take too long here to analyze, not only the motives that brought them
into the Order, but the various aspects, peace and the rest, under which
they viewed that adept state called 'Arahatta,' which they all are
affirmed to have won, and the assurance of which is termed A<span
class="small">ÑÑĀ</span> (lit., *ad-sciens*). I will only touch on one
avenue opened up for the adept woman, that has ever been sought by her
in whatever communion she graduated. For all her inspired musings under
the hilly skies or the cool shade, the Therī's life was not wholly one
of introspective reverie, free or regulated. The Order, refuge though it
proved, was primarily an organization for the propaganda of the Dhamma
or 'Norm,'[<sup>51</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxv-2.md) and its members were all,
more or less, wholly or at times, saviours and good shepherds of stray
sheep. Instances of this one and that 'teaching the Dhamma' will be met
with in the Psalms and their story, notably those of
[Paṭācārā](pos10.htm#XLVII), of [Puṇṇikā](pos17.htm#LXV.md) the serf, of
[Vāsitthi](pos11.htm#LI), and of [Sukkā](pos08.htm#XXXIV.md), pupil of the
greater preacher, [Dhammadinnā](pos06.htm#XII.md). Indeed, we find it not
hard to picture Sukkā[<sup>53</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxvi-1.md) pacing to and
fro on the rostrum of her terrace, her audience sitting cross-legged or
otherwise, enchanted, spellbound in the dappled shade around her, while
from out of the venerable, once sacred tree, near which the group of
cells clustered, the elfin face of the Dryad–her ancient votive shrine
neglected, yet herself stirred to enthusiasm by this New Woman's
eloquence–leans out from the trunk,

> *                            'fain to quaff  
> That life's elixir, once gained never lost,  
> That welleth ever up in her sweet words,  
> E'en as the wayfarer welcomes the rain.'*

Another Psalmist, [Bhaddā Kāpilānī](pos09.htm#XXXVII.md), is also spoken of
in the *Vinaya* (*Vin.*, iv. 290, 292) as a learned and honoured
preacher of the Dhamma. And in the *Anguttara Nikāya* we meet with
another Sister, called 'The Kajangalan'– namely, of that town–who,
though no Psalmist, expounds to an inquiring congregation the very
theme, the first question concerning which baffled her notable
colleague, Bhaddā Curlyhair (*Ang. Nik*., v. 54 ſ.; Ps.
[xlvi](pos10.htm#XLVI).md).

The two instances–possibly versions of one and the same legend–of
itinerant women debaters,[<sup>54</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxvi-2.md) betray the
breaking out of active intellects into less cramped, if unprofitable
channels. Organized educational work in the Order must have proved
greatly welcome to such temperaments.

It may assist readers to gain a purview of how the Therīs envisaged
their *summum bonum*, if I give a summary of my own analysis, together
with the number of Psalms in which each aspect is emphasized. The table
is not exhaustive, and might be supplemented, and in most cases more
than one aspect appears in one and the same poem. The End of Living or
of Rebirths, *e.g.*, forms almost a ground-wave to be discerned in the
majority of the Psalms, if not always the surface-billow.

For those who are acquainted with the way in which, in Christianity, the
cult of the Madonna and of women saints grafted itself upon, and in part
sprang out of, the widely spread cult of tribal goddesses in Europe,
[<sup>57</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxviii-2.md) the question will arise: 'Can
anything of the sort be traced regarding the veneration of these women's
names in the Buddhist scriptures?' But we are not here dealing with a
cult of a woman or women, hence we may scarcely expect anything of
positive value to comparative research in this field. Very faint traits
of affinity here and there may suggest themselves to the keen *flair* of
the anthropologist. There is, for instance, the association between
Therī and tree. Beneath some tree they are wont to sit, to stand, to
preach. In the [Appendix](pos22.htm#APPENDIX.md) they are always said to be
found beneath, not *a* tree, but a *certain* tree:–*aññatarasmiŋ
rukkhamūle*. Again, while there is nothing in their names associating
them with hill-shrines, as is the case with 'berg and 'burg names of
German women-saints, that the Therīs *are* found, for no very apparent
reason, seated on hill-tops, I have shown. Once more, is there perhaps
in the three sisters of Nālaka in Magadha–[Cālā](pos12.htm#LIX.md),
[Upacālā](pos12.htm#LX), [Sīsupacālā](pos13.htm#LXI.md)–some echo of those
local triads of goddesses, or saints that are common in German lore, and
which loom, dim with antiquity, in the Semnai or Venerable Goddesses of
Greek worship, [<sup>58</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxviii-3.md) and in the Trinity
of the Norns or Fates? Almost, finally, am I tempted to see significance
in the form of the refrain adopted by or for the ageing ex-courtezan's
Psalm–that of [Ambapālī](pos18.htm#LXVI.md)–

> *'So and not otherwise runneth the rune, the word of the Soothsayer,'*

*i.e.*, literally, the Truth-speaker. [<sup>59</sup>](pos04.htm#xxxix-1.md)
There is no mystic association attaching to the word *saccavādī*, where
it occurs elsewhere, hence I lay no weight on this choice of a name for
the Master. Nevertheless it is interesting to find these two ancient
institutions, the hetaira of the community and the Wise Woman, with her
monopoly of seeing things as they have been, are, or will be, combined
in one and the same poem.

III

In conclusion, let it be said that, while the text of the Commentary
containing the life-history of each Sister has been here and there
abridged and condensed, the verses have been translated as faithfully as
lay in my power consistently with the attempt to convey something of the
poetic and religious feeling of the metrical original. To do this for a
foreign idiom and an alien and ancient tradition, it was often necessary
to expand each bead in some rosary of terms into a phrase. *E.g.*, the
end of verse [337](pos18.htm#337.md):

>          *vītarāgā.*  
> 'Who also have themselves from passion freed,  
>                  *visaŋyuttā*  
> Unyoked from bondage, loosened from the world,  
>                          *katakiccā*  
> Who have accomplished their appointed task,  
>                                 *anāsavā*  
> And all that drugged their hearts have purged away.'

No attempt has been made to force English into the Pali rhythms. Of
these the one that is used in nearly all the gāthās is the *śloka*. It
is as prevalent in Buddhist metrical diction as is the iambic
five-footed line in ours. The line just quoted may be recited to
illustrate it:

Where the metre varies, I have indicated the variety so far as I was
able.

One of the more interesting varieties is the poem of
[Ambapālī](pos18.htm#LXVI.md), in which this once famous Thaïs contemplates
her wasted charms. The metre is approximately that which came, in later
literature, to be known as the Rathoddhatā (or Chariot-borne) variant of
the Trishṭubh:

But in two or three cases I have not been able to identify the metre.
[<sup>60</sup>](pos04.htm#xl-1.md) Studies in Indian prosody so far have
been made chiefly in much later literature, when verses were largely
made for metres. In these early rhythms, the poet may have been less
hampered by precedent and convention.

Where the English limps lamely (I pass over the lack in the translator
of poetic gift or training), this is in part due to a desire to put in
no religious tropes and figures from Western traditions. Where they have
intruded, notice of the exotic element is given. Some day the Pali
gāthās will find their William Morris, their Gilbert Murray. In this
makeshift venture, I have striven to make the translation such that the
English reader, mindful as he goes of wayside warnings in footnotes,
might feel confident that the lines before him do not omit
subject-matter that is in the original, nor add subject-matter that is
not. [<sup>61</sup>](pos04.htm#xli-1.md) At the same time, let it be
readily admitted that the renderings are so far free as to disqualify
the book from serving as a 'crib' to the student. If my gifted German
predecessor in this effort could not adhere literally to the text, the
English language, with its abhorrence of compound words, its poverty in
prefixes and verbal nouns, starts him who wields it at a yet greater
distance from the Pali. To regulate the more careful reader's
confidence, or want of it, in the renderings selected, many words in the
Index will be found with the Pali originals appended.

One more word in this connection. If I have used 'Sister' in preference
to 'nun,' it was not, in sooth, that the latter term, in its *original*
connotation of *nonna*, or mother, was not an adequate, and more than
adequate, rendering for Bhikkhunī. It was rather to keep my Indian
recluses free from such implication of confinement within walls and to
lifelong vows as may now attach to the word 'nun.'

It needs no confession of mine to place on record the help I found, at
the initial stage of translation, in Dr. Neumann's translation of the
gāthās, as well as in Professor Windisch's prose rendering of the verses
in the [Appendix](pos22.htm#APPENDIX.md). That with regard to the former,
the differences in German and English metrical idiom, combined with,
here and there, difference in judgment, should have often led me to
reach the end by a different way, does not by any means obviate the fact
of the aid received. Pioneers had been step-cutting before me, and all
honour to pioneers.

> *'Ukkādhāro manussānaŋ  
> Niccaŋ apacito mayā.'* [<sup>62</sup>](pos04.htm#xlii-1.md)

And as my husband, seventeen years ago, introduced me to these dear and
revered ladies–

> *'So me dhammaŋ adesesi therīhi suppakāsitaŋ'*

–so now has he furthered and guarded my efforts with advice and
criticism.

Gladly and gratefully would I record the kindness of those who have
helped me in procuring the illustrations–to wit, Mr. J. H. Marshall,
Director-General of the Archaeology Survey of India, who sent me many
photographs of Rajgir, Sahēṭh-Mahēṭh, and other places; Dr. T. Bloch, of
the Indian Museum, Calcutta; Mr. C. H. Hooper, of Messrs. Thacker, Spink
and Co., Calcutta, who sent me several forest scenes; my brother, C. W.
Foley, of Calcutta, who procured for me a selection of views about Gayā;
Mrs. Arthur Schuster, who laid her large collection of photographs,
taken on her Indian travels, at my disposal; Mr. and Mrs. Ernest B.
Havell; and lastly, Mr. F. J. Payne, hon. secretary of the Buddhist
Society, G.B. and I., who has given me valuable assistance in carrying
out the work of illustration. Through their prompt and generous aid the
book might have been interleaved throughout with interesting views of
the ancient haunts of the Sisters, had it been practicable.
