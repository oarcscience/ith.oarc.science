## <span id="C-XII">CANTO XII PSALM OF SIXTEEN VERSES</span>

### <span id="LXV">LXV Puṇṇā or Puṇṇikā.</span> [<sup>329</sup>](pos17.htm#116-1.md)

S<span class="small">HE</span>, too, having made her resolve under
former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this and
that rebirth, was, when Vipassi was Buddha, reborn in a clansman's
family. Come to years of discretion, because of the promise that was in
her, she waxed anxious at the prospect of rebirth, and, going to the
Bhikkhunīs, heard the Norm, believed, and entered the Order. Perfect in
virtue, and learning the Three Pitakas, she became very learned in the
Norm, and a teacher of it. The same destiny befell her under the five
succeeding Buddhas–Sikhi, Vessabhu, Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa.
But because of her tendency to pride, she was unable to root out the
defilements. [<sup>330</sup>](pos17.htm#116-2.md) So it came to pass,
through the karma of her pride, that, in this Buddha-era, she was reborn
at Sāvatthī, in the household of Anāthapiṇḍika, the Treasurer, of a
domestic slave. She became a Stream-entrant after hearing the discourse
of the Lion's Roar. [<sup>331</sup>](pos17.htm#117-1.md) Afterwards, when
she had converted (lit. tamed) the baptist
[<sup>332</sup>](pos17.htm#117-2.md) brahmin, and so won her master's
esteem that he made her a freed woman, she obtained his consent, as her
guardian and head of her home, to enter the Order. And, practising
insight, she in no long time won Arahantship, together with thorough
grasp of the Norm in form and in meaning. Reflecting on her attainment,
she uttered these verses in exultation:

<p><span id="236">Drawer of water, I down to the stream,</span> <a href="pos17.htm#117-3"><sup>333</sup></a><br />
Even in winter, went in fear of blows,<br />
Harassed by fear of blame from mistresses. (236)<br />
<span id="237"><br />
'What, brahmin, fearest thou that ever thus<br />
Thou goest down into the river? Why<br />
With shiv'ring limbs dost suffer bitter cold?' (237)</span><br />
<span id="238"><br />
'Well know'st thou, damsel Puṇṇikā, why ask<br />
One who by righteous karma thus annuls<br />
Effect of evil karma? Who in youth, (238)</span><br />
<span id="239">Or age ill deeds hath wrought, by baptism<br />
Of water from that karma is released.' (239)</span><br />
<span id="240"><br />
'Nay now, who, ignorant to the ignorant,<br />
Hath told thee this: that water-baptism<br />
From evil karma can avail to free? (240)</span><br />
<span id="241">Why then the fishes</span> <a href="pos17.htm#117-4"><sup>334</sup></a> and the tortoises,<br />
The frogs, the watersnakes, the crocodiles<br />
And all that haunt the water straight to heaven (241)<br />
<span id="242">Will go. Yea, all who evil karma work–<br />
Butchers of sheep and swine, hunters of game,<br />
Thieves, murderers–so they but splash themselves<br />
With water, are from evil karma free! (242)</span><br />
<span id="243">And if these streams could bear away what erst<br />
Of evil thou hast wrought, they'd bear away<br />
Thy merit too, leaving thee stripped and bare. (243)</span><br />
<span id="244">That, dreading which, thou, brahmin, comest e'er<br />
To bathe and shiver here, that, even that<br />
Leave thou undone, and save thy skin from frost.' (244)</span><br />
<span id="245"><br />
'Men who in error's ways had gone aside<br />
Thou leadest now into the Ariyan Path.<br />
Damsel, my bathing raiment give I thee.' (245)</span><br />

'Keep thou thy raiment! Raiment seek I none.<br />
If ill thou fearest, if thou like it not, (246)</span><br />
<span id="247">Do thou no open, nor no hidden wrong.<br />
But if thou shalt do evil, or hast done, (247)</span><br />
<span id="248">Then is there no escape for thee from ill,<br />
E'en tho' thou see it come, and flee away.<br />
If thou fear ill, if ill delight thee not, (248)</span><br />
<span id="249">Go thou and seek the Buddha and the Norm<br />
And Order for thy refuge; learn of them<br />
To keep the Precepts. Thus shalt thou find good.' (249)</span><br />
<span id="250"><br />
'Lo! to the Buddha I for refuge go,<br />
And to the Norm and Order. I will learn<br />
Of them to take upon myself and keep<br />
The Precepts; so shall I indeed find good. (250)</span><br />
<span id="251"><br />
Once but a son of brahmins born was I,<br />
To-day I stand brahmin in very deed.<br />
The nobler Threefold Wisdom have I won,<br />
Won the true Veda-lore, and graduate<br />
Am I, from better Sacrament returned,<br />
Cleansed by the inward spiritual bath.'</span> <a href="pos17.htm#119-1"><sup>335</sup></a> (251)</p></td>

For the brahmin, established in the Refuges and the Precepts, when later
he had heard the Master preach the Norm, became a believer and entered
the Order. Using every effort, he not long after became Thrice-Wise,
[<sup>336</sup>](pos17.htm#119-2.md) and, reflecting on his state, exulted
in those verses. And the Sister, repeating them of herself, they all
became her Psalm.
