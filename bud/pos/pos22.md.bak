## <span id="APPENDIX">APPENDIX VERSES ATTRIBUTED TO SISTERS IN THE BHIKKHUNĪ-SAŊYUTTA OF THE SAŊYUTTA-NIKĀYA</span>

### <span id="A-1">1. Āḷavikā.</span> [<sup>454</sup>](pos22.htm#180-1.md)

T<span class="small">HUS</span> have I heard. The Exalted One was once
staying at Sāvatthī, in the Jeta Grove, the park of Anāthapiṇḍika. Now
Āḷavikā the Bhikkhunī dressed herself early and, taking bowl and robe,
entered Sāvatthī for food. And when she had gone about Sāvatthī for it,
had broken her fast and returned, she entered the Dark Wood, seeking
solitude.

Then Māra the Evil One, desiring to arouse fear, wavering, and dread in
her, desiring to make her desist from being alone, went up to her, and
addressed her in a verse:

<table data-align="center">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong></strong>
<p>'Ne'er shalt thou find escape while in the world.<br />
What profiteth thee then thy loneliness?<br />
Take the good things of life while yet thou may'st,<br />
Repentance else too late awaiteth thee.'</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Then Āḷavikā thought: 'Who now is this, human or non-human, that
speaketh this verse? Sure 'tis Māra the Evil One speaketh it, desirous
to arouse in me fear, wavering and dread, desirous to make me desist
from my solitude.' And Bhikkhunī Āḷavikā, knowing that 'twas he, replied
with a verse:

<table data-align="center">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong></strong>
<p>'There is escape while in the world, and I<br />
Have well attained thereto by insight won.<br />
Thou evil limb of loafing! <a href="pos22.htm#181-1"><sup>455</sup></a> 'tis not thine<br />
To know that bourne, or how it may be reached.<br />
Like spears and jav'lins are the joys of sense,<br />
That pierce and rend the mortal frames of us.<br />
These that thou callest "the good things of life,"<br />
Good of that ilk to me is nothing worth.'</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Then Māra, thinking, 'Bhikkhunī Āḷavikā knows me!' vanished thence, sad
and dejected.

### <span id="A-2">2. Somā.</span> [<sup>456</sup>](pos22.htm#181-2.md)

. . . . . [<sup>457</sup>](pos22.htm#181-3.md) Now Somā . . . . . entered
the Dark Wood for siesta, and, plunging into its depths, sat down at the
root of a certain tree for siesta.

Then Māra the Evil One, desiring to arouse fear, wavering, and dread in
her, desiring to make her desist from concentrated thought, went up to
her, and addressed her in a verse:

<table data-align="center">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong></strong>
<p>'That vantage-ground the sages may attain is hard<br />
To reach. With her two-finger consciousness<br />
That is no woman competent to gain!'</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Then Somā thought . . . . . 'Sure 'tis Māra!'. . . . and replied with
verses:

<table data-align="center">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong></strong>
<p>'What should the woman's nature do to them <a href="pos22.htm#181-4"><sup>458</sup></a><br />
Whose hearts are firmly set, who ever move<br />
With growing knowledge onward in the Path?<br />
What can that signify to one in whom<br />
Insight doth truly comprehend the Norm?<br />
To one for whom the question doth arise:<br />
Am I a woman in these matters, or<br />
Am I a man, or what not am I, then?<br />
To such an one is Māra fit to talk!'</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Then Māra, thinking, 'Bhikkhunī Somā knows me,' vanished thence, sad and
dejected.

### <span id="A-3">3. Gotamī.</span> [<sup>459</sup>](pos22.htm#182-1.md)

. . . . . Now the Lean Gotamid . . . . . entered the Dark Wood for
siesta, and, plunging into its depths, sat down at the root of a certain
tree for siesta. Then Māra . . . . . went up to her, and addressed her
in a verse:

<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong></strong>
<p>'How now? Dost sit alone with tearful face<br />
As mother stricken by the loss of child?<br />
Thou who hast plunged into the woods alone,<br />
Is it a man that thou hast come to seek?'</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Then the Lean Gotamid thought . . . . . 'Sure 'tis Māra!' . . . . . and
replied with verses:

<table data-align="center">

</colgroup>

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong></strong>
<p>'Ay, ever am I she whose child is lost! <a href="pos22.htm#182-2"><sup>460</sup></a><br />
And for the seeking, there are men at hand.<br />
I do not grieve, I am not shedding tears,<br />
And as for thee, good sir, I fear thee not.<br />
Slain everywhere is love of worldly joys,<br />
And the thick gloom of ignorance is rent in twain.<br />
Defeating all the army of the power of death,<br />
I here abide purged of the poison-drugs.' <a href="pos22.htm#183-1"><sup>461</sup></a></p></td>

Then Māra, thinking, 'Bhikkhunī Gotamī knows me!' vanished thence, sad
and dejected.

### <span id="A-4">4. Vijayā.</span> [<sup>462</sup>](pos22.htm#183-2.md)

Lady, and let us take our fill of joy!'</p></td>

Then Bhikkhunī Vijayā thought . . . . . 'Sure 'tis Māra!' . . . . . and
. . . . . replied with verses:

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong></strong>
<p>'Sights, sounds and tastes and smells and things to touch,<br />
Wherein the mind delights, I leave them all<br />
To thee, Māra; for such no mind have I!<br />
This body vile, this brittle, crumbling thing,<br />
Doth touch me only with distress and shame.<br />
Craving for joys of sense is rooted out.<br />
They who have come to worlds of form, and they<br />
Who dwell where form is not, and that perfect<br />
Attainment which is peace <a href="pos22.htm#184-1"><sup>465</sup></a> –from all,<br />
From everywhere, the darkness is dispelled.'</p></td>

### <span id="A-5">5. Uppalavaṇṇā.</span>

. . . . . Now, Bhikkhunī Uppalavaṇṇā . . . . . entered the Dark Wood for
siesta, and, plunging into its depths, halted at the root of a certain
sāla-tree in full blossom.

Then Māra . . . . . addressed her in a verse:

Fearest thou not, O foolish maiden, the wiles of seducers?' <a href="pos22.htm#184-2"><sup>466</sup></a></p></td>

Then Bhikkhunī Uppalavaṇṇā thought . . . . . 'Sure 'tis Māra!' . . . . .
and . . . . . replied with verses:

<table data-align="center">

<p>'Were there an hundred thousand seducers e'en such as thou art,<br />
Ne'er would I tremble affrighted thereat, or turn a hair of me.<br />
Māra, I fear not thee, all lonely though I be standing.<br />
Here though I stand, I vanish, or enter into thy body.<br />
See! 'twixt thine eyelashes hide, standing where thou canst not see me.<br />
For all my mind is wholly self-controlled,<br />
And the Four Paths to Potency are thoroughly learnt.<br />
Yea, I am free from all the Bonds there be.<br />
In sooth, good sir, no fear have I of thee!'</p></td>

Then Māra, thinking, 'Bhikkhunī Uppalavaṇṇā knows me!' vanished thence,

### <span id="A-6">6. Cālā.</span> [<sup>467</sup>](pos22.htm#186-1.md)

. . . . . Now, Bhikkhunī Cālā . . . . . sat down at the root of a
certain tree for siesta.

Then Māra the Evil One went up to her, and spoke thus to her: 'Wherein,
O Sister, dost thou find no pleasure?'

'In birth, [<sup>468</sup>](pos22.htm#186-2.md) good sir, I find no
pleasure.'

'Why findest thou no pleasure in birth? Once born, one enjoys the
pleasures of a life of sense. Who hath put this into thy mind–"Find no
pleasure in birth"–Sister?'

The bonds, the torments, and the life cut off. <a href="pos22.htm#186-3"><sup>469</sup></a><br />
The Buddha hath revealed the Norm to us–<br />
How we may get beyond the power of birth,<br />
How we may put an end to every Ill.<br />
'Tis He hath guided me into the True.<br />
They who have come to worlds of Form, and they<br />
Who in those worlds abide where Form is not,<br />
An they know not how they may end it all,<br />

<p>'Where, Sister, dost thou wish to rise again?'<br />

'Now, think upon the Three-and-Thirty gods,<br />
And on the gods who rule in realm of Shades,<br />
On those who reign in Heaven of Bliss, and on<br />
Those higher deities who live where life<br />
Yet flows by way of sense and of desire–<br />
Think, and thither aspire with longing heart,<br />
The bliss of each in turn shall then be thine.'<br />
</p>
<p><em>Upacālā</em>.</p>
<p>Ay, think upon the Three-and-Thirty gods,<br />
And on the gods who rule in realm of Shades,<br />
On those who reign in Heaven of Bliss, and on<br />
Those higher deities who live where life<br />
Yet flows by way of sense and of desire!<br />
They all are bound by bonds of sense-desire,<br />
Hence come they evermore 'neath Māra's sway.<br />
On fire is all the world, is wrapt in smoke. <a href="pos22.htm#187-2"><sup>472</sup></a><br />
Ablaze is all the world, the heav'ns do quake!<br />
But that which quaketh not, influctuate, <a href="pos22.htm#188-1"><sup>473</sup></a><br />
Untrodden by the average worldling's feet,<br />
Where Māra cometh not nor hath way-gate–<br />
There doth my heart abide in blest retreat.' <a href="pos22.htm#188-2"><sup>474</sup></a></p></td>

. . . . . Now, Bhikkhunī Sīsupacālā . . . . . sat down at the root of a
certain tree for siesta.

Then Māra the Evil One went up to her, and spoke to her thus: 'Of whose
shibboleth, Sister, dost thou approve?' 'I approve of no one's
shibboleth, good sir.'

Ascetics of some sort and shibboleth?<br />
What, futile and infatuate, is thy quest?'<br />

''Tis they that are without, caught in the net<br />
Of the vain shibboleths in which they trust–<br />
Their's is the doctrine I cannot approve.<br />
'Tis they that lack acquaintance with the Norm.<br />
<br />
'Lo! in the princely Sākiya clan is born<br />
A Buddha peerless 'mong the sons of men,<br />
Who all hath overcome, before whose face<br />
Māra doth flee away, who everywhere<br />
Unconquered stands, He that is wholly freed<br />
And fetterless, the Seer who seeth all,<br />
For whom all karma is destroyed, who in<br />
The perishing of every germ that birth<br />
Once more engenders, is at liberty.<br />
This the Exalted One, my Master and my Lord:<br />
His doctrine, His the word that I approve.'</p></td>

For e'en as, when the factors are arranged,<br />
The product by the word "chariot" is known,<br />
So doth our usage covenant to say–<br />
"A being"–when the aggregates are there.<br />
''Tis simply Ill that riseth, simply Ill<br />
That doth persist, and then fadeth away.<br />
Nought beside Ill it is that doth become;<br />

Here endeth the Bhikkhunī Series.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="B"></span>

The Yakkha-Saŋyutta, or Fairy Series in the same Nikāya, gives the
summons uttered by the indignant tree-fairy to the people of Rājagaha in
Sukkā's little poem ([Ps. xxxiv](pos08.htm#XXXIV)..md). The lines are
exactly the same, except that 'wayfarer' is *panthagū* instead of
*addhagū*.

In the following Sutta presumably the same devoted spirit proclaims the
praises both of Sukkā and of a lay-disciple who supplied the eloquent
Therī with food:
