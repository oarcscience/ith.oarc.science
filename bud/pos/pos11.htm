T<small>HESE</small> too, having fared under former Buddhas as the foregoing Sisters, were, in this Buddha-era, reborn in some clansman's house in divers places, were married, and bore children, living domestic lives. And having wrought karma such as would bring to pass such a result, they suffered bereavement in the death of a child. Then they found their way, overwhelmed with grief, to Pa&#x1E6D;&#x0101;c&#x0101;r&#x0101;, and saluting her, and seated by, her, told her the manner of their sorrow. The Sister, restraining their sorrow, spake thus:
</P>

<TABLE align=center>

The way by which men come we cannot know; <BR>
Nor can we see the path by which they go.<BR>
Why mournest then for him who came to thee,<BR>
Lamenting through thy tears: 'My son! my son!'	(127)</A><BR><A NAME="128">
Seeing thou knowest not the way he came, <BR>
Nor yet the manner of his leaving thee? <BR>
Weep not, for such is here the life of man. (128)</A><BR><A NAME="129">
Unask'd he came, unbidden went he hence. <BR>
Lo! ask thyself again whence came thy son <BR>
To bide on earth this little breathing space? (129)</A><BR><A NAME="130">
By one way come and by another gone, <BR>
As man to die, and pass to other births&#8211; <BR>

They, hearing her doctrine, were filled with agitation, and, under the Ther&#x012B;, renounced the world. Exercising themselves henceforth in insight, their faculties growing ripe for emancipation, they soon became established in Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and in meaning. Thereafter, pondering on their attainment, they exulted in those words, 'The way by which men come,' adding thereto other verses, and repeating them in turn, as follows:
</P>

<TABLE align=center>
<TR><TD>
<B><P><A NAME="131">
Lo! from my heart the hidden shaft is gone, <BR>
The shaft that nestled there she hath removed, <BR>
And that consuming grief for my dead child <BR>
Which poisoned all the life of me is dead. (131)</A><BR><A NAME="132">
To-day my heart is healed, my yearning stayed,<BR>
Perfected the deliverance wrought in me. <A HREF="pos11.htm#79-1"><sup>254</sup></A><BR>
Lo! I for refuge to the Buddha go&#8211;<BR>

Now, because those 500 Bhikkhums were versed in the
teaching of Pa&#x1E6D;&#x0101;c&#x0101;r&#x0101;, therefore they got the name of The Pa&#x1E6D;&#x0101;c&#x0101;r&#x0101;'s.

<sup>252</sup> <I>Pa&ntilde;casat&#x0101; Pa&#x1E6D;&#x0101;c&#x0101;r&#x0101;</I>. Dr. Neumann, who disregards the Commentary throughout as a mere exegesis and of less than no historical value, renders <I>pa&ntilde;casat&#x0101;</I> by 'of fivefold subtlety'&#8211;<I>die f&uuml;nfmal Feine</i>&#8211;<I>sat&#x0101;</I> being taken as 'one who has <I>sati</I>' (memory, mindfulness, discernment), Sanskrit <I>sm&#x1E5B;t&#x0101;</I>. I believe the expression <I>pa&ntilde;casat&#x0101;</I> occurs nowhere else; nor is there anything in the g&#x0101;th&#x0101;'s to justify the soubriquet. Nor am I concerned to euhemerize the, to us, mythical absurdity of 500 bereaved mothers all finding their way to one woman, illustrious teacher and herself bereaved mother though she might be. Five hundred, and one or two more such 'round numbers,' are, in Pali, tantamount simply to our 'dozens of them,' 'an hundredfold,' and the like. But, besides this, the phenomena of huge cities and swarming population are not, in countries of ancient civilization, matters of yesterday's growth, as in our case.

<sup>253</sup> The sharp contrast between this chant of consolation and that which any other religious anthology affords is sufficiently interesting. But if the burden of the chant, in its varied iteration, be imagined, not tripped off on the tongue of a cheerful critic or a disapproving other-believer, but uttered in grave, tender accents, coming from a heart that felt intensely because it had so ached, and from a mind that understood and was therefore serene . . .  Even so might Bouguereau's 'Vierge Consolatrice' speak, her great wise eyes looking forth over the anguished bereaved sister flung on her lap, while the dead child lies below at her feet.

She, too, faring under former Buddhas like the foregoing, was, in this Buddha-era, reborn in a clansman's
family at Ves&#x0101;l&#x012B;. Her parents gave her in marriage to a
clansman's son of equal rank, and she, bearing one son,
lived happily with her husband. But when the child was
able to run about, he died; and she was worn and maddened
with grief. And while the relatives were administering
healing to the husband, she, unknown to them, ran away
raving, and wandered round and round till she came to
Mithil&#x0101;. There she saw the Exalted One going down the
next street, self-controlled, self-contained, master of his
faculties. And at the sight of the wondrous Chief, <A HREF="pos11.htm#79-4"><sup>257</sup></A> and
through the potency of the Buddha, she regained her normal mind from the frenzy that had befallen her. Then the
Master taught her the Norm in outline, and in agitation
she asked him that she might enter the Order, and by his
command she was admitted. Performing all requisite
duties and preliminaries, she established insight, and,
striving with might and main, and with ripening knowledge, she soon attained Arahantship, together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and in spirit. Reflecting on her attainment, she exulted thus:

Now here, now there, lightheaded, crazed with grief,<BR>
Mourning my child, I wandered up and down, <BR>
Naked, unheeding, streaming hair unkempt, (133)</A><BR><A NAME="134">
Lodging in scourings of the streets, and where <BR>
The dead lay still, and by the chariot-roads&#8211; <BR>

The Very Buddha, Banisher of fear. (135)</A><BR><A NAME="136">
Came back my heart to me, my errant mind; <BR>
Forthwith to Him I went low worshipping, <BR>
And there, e'en at His feet I heard the Norm. <BR>
For of His great compassion on us all, <BR>
'Twas He who taught me, even G<small>OTAMA</small>. </A> <A HREF="pos11.htm#80-1"><sup>258</sup></A> (136)  <BR><A NAME="137">
<BR>
I heeded all He said and left the world <BR>
And all its cares behind, and gave myself <BR>
To follow where He taught, and realize <BR>
Life in the Path to great good fortune bound. (137)</A><BR><A NAME="138">
Now all my sorrows are hewn down, cast out, <BR>
Uprooted, brought to utter end, <BR>
In that I now can grasp and understand <BR>

Now she, when Padumuttara was Buddha, became a slave to others, dependent for her livelihood on others, at Ha&#x014B;savat&#x012B;. And one day, seeing the Elder, Suj&#x0101;ta, seeking alms, she gave him three sweet cakes, and at the same time took down her hair <A HREF="pos11.htm#81-1"><sup>259</sup></A> and gave it to the Elder, saying: 'May I in the future become a disciple, great in wisdom, of a Buddha!' After many fortunate rebirths as Queen among both gods and men, for that she had wrought good karma to the uttermost, she became a human, when Vipassi <A HREF="pos11.htm#81-2"><sup>260</sup></A> was Buddha. Renouncing the world, she became a learned preacher of the Norm. Reborn, when Kakusandha was Buddha, in a wealthy family, she made a great park for the Order, and delivered it over to the Order with the Buddha at their head. She did this again when Ko&#x1E47;&#x0101;gamana was Buddha. When Kassapa was Buddha she became the eldest daughter of King Kiki, <A HREF="pos11.htm#81-3"><sup>261</sup></A> named Sama&#x1E47;&#x012B;, lived a pious life, and gave a cell to the Order. Finally, in this Buddha-era, she was born in Magadha, at S&#x0101;gala, <A HREF="pos11.htm#81-4"><sup>262</sup></A> as one of the King's family, and named Khem&#x0101;. Beautiful, and with skin like gold, she became the consort of King Bimbis&#x0101;ra. While the Master was at the Bamboo Grove<A HREF="pos11.htm#81-5"><sup>263</sup></A> she, being infatuated with her own beauty, would not go to see him, fearing he would look on this as a fault in her. The King bade persons praise the Grove to her to induce her to visit it. And accordingly she asked him to let her see it. The King went to the Vih&#x0101;ra, and seeing no Master, but determined that she should not get away, he instructed his men to let the
Queen see Him of the Ten Powers, even by constraining her. And this they did when the Queen was about to leave without meeting the Master. As they brought her reluctant, the Master, by mystic potency, conjured up a woman like a celestial nymph, who stood fanning him with a palmyra leaf. And Khem&#x0101;, seeing her, thought: 'Verily the Exalted One has around him women as lovely as goddesses. I am not fit even to wait upon such. I am undone by my base and mistaken notions!' Then, as she looked, that woman, through the steadfast will of the Master, passed from youth to middle age and old age, till, with broken teeth, grey hair, and wrinkled skin, she fell to earth with her palm-leaf. Then Khem&#x0101;, because of her ancient resolve, thought: 'Has such a body come to be a wreck like that? Then so will my body also!' And the Master, knowing her thoughts, said:

'They who are slaves to lust drift down the stream, <BR>
Like to a spider gliding down the web <BR>
He of himself has wrought. But the released, <BR>
Who all their bonds have snapt in twain, <BR>

And all delight in sense put far away.' <A HREF="pos11.htm#82-1"><sup>264</sup></A>

The Commentaries say that when he had finished, she attained Arahantship, together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and meaning. But according to the Apad&#x0101;na, she was established only in the Fruit of one who has entered the Stream, and, the King consenting, entered the Order ere she became an Arahant. <A HREF="pos11.htm#82-2"><sup>265</sup></A>

Thereafter she became known for her great insight, and was ranked foremost herein by the Exalted One, seated in the conclave of Ariyans at the Jeta Grove Vih&#x0101;ra.

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and accumulating good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, and consolidating the essential conditions for emancipation, was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at S&#x0101;keta, in the Treasurer's family. Given by her parents in marriage to a Treasurer's son of equal rank, she lived happily with him. Going one day to take part in an Astral Festival <A HREF="pos11.htm#84-2"><sup>271</sup></A> in the pleasure-grounds, she was returning with her attendants to the town, when, in the A&ntilde;jana Grove, she saw the Master, and her heart being drawn to him, she drew near, did obeisance, and seated herself. The Master, finishing his discourse in order, and knowing the sound state of her mind, expounded the Norm to her in an inspiring lesson. Thereat, because her intelligence was fully ripe, she, even as she sat, attained Arahantship, together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and meaning. Saluting the Master, and going home, she obtained her husband's and her parents' consent, and by command of the Master was admitted to the Order of Bhikkhun&#x012B;s.

She, too, having made resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, perfecting the conditions tending to bring about emancipation, was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at S&#x0101;keta as the daughter of the Treasurer, Majjha. Because of her beauty she got the name 'Peerless' (An-opam&#x0101;). When she grew up, many rich men's sons, Kings' ministers, and Princes, sent messengers to the father, saying: 'Give us your daughter Anopam&#x0101;, and we will give this, or that.' Hearing of this, she&#8211;for that the promise of the highest was in her&#8211;thought: 'Profit to me in the life of the House there is none'; and sought the Master's presence. She heard him teach, and her intelligence maturing, the memory of that teaching, and the strenuous effort for insight she made, established her in the Third Path&#8211;that of No-return. Asking the Master for admission, she was by his order admitted among the Bhikkhun&#x012B;s. And on the seventh day thereafter, she realized Arahantship. Reflecting thereon, she exulted:

<P>
Now she was born, when Padumuttara was Buddha, in the city of Ha&#x014B;savat&#x012B;, in a clansman's family. Hearing the Master preaching, and assigning the foremost place for experience to a certain Bhikkhun&#x012B;, she vowed such a place should one day be hers. Then, after many births, once more was she reborn in the Buddha-empty era, between Kassapa and our Buddha, at Benares, as the forewoman among 500 slave-girls. <A HREF="pos11.htm#87-1"><sup>274</sup></A> Now, when the rains drew near, five Silent Buddhas came down from the Nandam&#x016B;laka mountain-cave to Isipatana, seeking alms; and those women got their husbands to erect five huts for the Buddhas during the three rainy months, and they provided them with all they required during that time. Reborn once more in a
weaver's village near Benares, in the headman's family, she again ministered to Silent Buddhas. Finally, she was reborn, shortly before our Master came to us, at Devadaha, in the family of Mah&#x0101;-Suppabuddha. <A HREF="pos11.htm#88-1"><sup>275</sup></A> Her family name was Gotama, and she was the younger sister of the Great M&#x0101;y&#x0101;. And the interpreters of birthmarks declared that the children of both sisters would be Wheel-rolling Rulers.<A HREF="pos11.htm#88-2"><sup>276</sup></A> Now, King Suddhodana, when he came of age, held a festival, and wedded both the sisters. After this, when our Master had arisen, and, in turning the excellent wheel of the Norm, came in course of fostering souls to Ves&#x0101;li, his father, who had reached Arahantship, died.
</P>

<P>
Then the great Paj&#x0101;pat&#x012B;, wishing to leave the world, asked the Master for admission, but obtained it not. Then she cut off her hair, put on the robes, and at the end of the sermon now forming the Suttanta on strife and contention, she sallied forth, and together with 500 S&#x0101;kya ladies whose husbands had renounced the world, went to Ves&#x0101;l&#x012B;, and asked the Master, through &#x0100;nanda the Thera, for ordination. This she then obtained, with the eight maxims for Bhikkhun&#x012B;s.
</P>

<P>
Thus ordained, the Great Paj&#x0101;pat&#x012B; came and saluted the Master, and stood on one side. Then he taught her the Norm; and she, exercising herself and practising, soon after obtained Arahantship, accompanied by intuitive and analytical knowledge. The remaining 500 Bhikkhun&#x012B;s, after Nandaka's homily, became endowed with the six branches of intuitive knowledge.
</P>

<P>
Now, one day, when the Master was seated in the conclave of Ariyans at the great Jeta Grove Vih&#x0101;ra, he assigned the foremost place in experience to Great Paj&#x0101;pat&#x012B;, the Gotamid. She, dwelling in the bliss of fruition and of Nibbana, testified her gratitude one day by declaring her A<small>&Ntilde;&Ntilde;&#x0100;</small> before the Master, in praising his virtue, who had brought help where before there had been none:

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and accumulating good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, and consolidating the essential conditions for emancipation, was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at S&#x0101;vatth&#x012B;, in a brahmin's family, and named Gutt&#x0101;. When adolescent, life in the house became repugnant to her, and she obtained her parents' consent to enter the Order under the Great Paj&#x0101;pat&#x012B;. Thereafter, though she practised with devotion, her heart long persisted in running after external interests, and this destroyed concentration. Then the Master, to encourage her, sent forth glory, and appeared near her, as if seated in the air, saying these words:

And when the Master had made an end of that utterance, the Sister attained Arahantship, together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and meaning. And exulting thereon, she uttered those lines in their order as spoken by the Exalted One, whence they came to be called the Ther&#x012B;'s psalm.

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy, was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at R&#x0101;jagaha, in a certain clansman's family. When grown up she became the companion of Khem&#x0101;, afterwards Ther&#x012B;, but then of the laity. Hearing that Khem&#x0101; had renounced the world, she said: 'If she, as a King's consort, can leave the world, surely I can.' So to Khem&#x0101; Ther&#x012B; she went, and the latter, discerning whereon her heart was set, taught her the Norm so as to agitate her mind concerning rebirth, and to make her seek comfort in the system. And so it came to pass; and the Ther&#x012B; ordained her. She, serving as was due, and studying as was due,
grew in insight, and, the promise being in her, soon attained to Arahantship, together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and meaning. And she, reflecting thereon, exulted thus:
