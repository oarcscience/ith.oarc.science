How was she reborn?

Long ago, a certain daughter of one of the clans became a fervent
believer in the teaching of the Buddha Koṇāgamana,
[<sup>78</sup>](pos06.htm#9-1) and entertained him hospitably. She had
an arbour made with boughs, a draped ceiling, and a sanded floor, and
did him honour with flowers and perfumes. And all her life doing
meritorious acts, she was reborn among the gods, and then again among
men when Kassapa was Buddha, under whom she renounced the world. Reborn
again in heaven till this Buddha-dispensation, she was finally born in a
great nobleman's family at Vesālī. From the sturdy build of her body
they called her Sturdykin. She became the devoted wife of a young noble.
When the Master came to Vesālī, she was convinced by his teaching, and
became a lay-disciple. Anon, hearing the Great Pajāpatī the Elder
preaching the Doctrine, the wish arose in her to leave the world, and
she told this to her husband. He would not consent; so she went on
performing her duties, reflecting on the sweetness of the doctrine, and
living devoted to insight. Then, one day in the kitchen, while the curry
was cooking, a mighty flame of fire shot up, and burnt all the food with
much crackling. She, watching it, made it a basis for rapt meditation on
the utter impermanence of all things. Thereby she was established in the
Fruition of the Path of No-Return. Thenceforth she wore no more jewels
and ornaments. When her husband asked her the reason, she told him how
incapable she felt of living a domestic life. So he brought her, as
Visākha brought Dhammadinnā,[<sup>79</sup>](pos06.htm#10-1) with a large
following, to Great Pajāpatī the Gotamid, and said: 'Let the reverend
Sisters give her ordination.' And Pajāpatī did so, and showed her the
Master; and the Master, emphasizing, as was his custom, the visible
basis whereby she had attained, spoke the verse above.

Now, when she had attained Arahantship, the Sister repeated that verse
in her exultation, wherefore this verse became her verse.

This is the verse of a student named Muttā. She, too, being one who had
made a resolve under former Buddhas, went on heaping up good of
age-enduring efficacy in this and that state of becoming. Finally, she
was reborn in this Buddha-dispensation as the child of an eminent
brahmin at Sāvatthī, and named Muttā. And in her twentieth year, her
destiny being fully ripe, she renounced the world under the Great
Pajāpatī the Gotamid, and studied the exercises for ecstatic insight.
Returning one day from her round for alms, she discharged her duties
toward her seniors, and then going apart to rest, and seated out of
sight, she began to concentrate herself. Then the Master, sitting in the
'Fragrant Chamber'[<sup>83</sup>](pos06.htm#11-1) of the Vihāra, sent
forth glory, and revealing himself as if seated before her, uttered the
verse above. And she, steadfast in that exhortation, not long after
attained Arahantship, and so attaining, exulted in the words of that
verse. Completing her studies and promoted to full rank, she yet again
uttered it, when about to pass away.

### <span id="III">III Puṇṇā.</span>

The following verse is that of a student named
Puṇṇā.[<sup>84</sup>](pos06.htm#11-2) She, heaping up good of
age-enduring efficacy under former Buddhas in this and that state of
becoming, was born–when the world was empty of a Saviour Buddha–as a
fairy, by the River Candabhāgā.[<sup>85</sup>](pos06.htm#11-3) One day
she worshipped a certain Silent [<sup>86</sup>](pos06.htm#11-4) Buddha
with a wreath of reeds. Thereby gaining heaven, she was, in this
Buddha-dispensation, reborn as the child of a leading burgess of
Sāvatthi and named Puṇṇā. When she had so dwelt for twenty years, her
destiny then being fully ripe, she heard the Great Pajāpatī teach the
doctrine, and renounced the world. Becoming a student, she began to
practise insight. And the Master from the 'Fragrant Chamber' shed a
glory, and spake this verse:

<table data-align="center">

And scatter all the gloom of ignorance.<a href="pos06.htm#12-2"><sup>88</sup></a> (3)</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Hearing this, her insight grew, and she attained Arahantship. This verse
is the expression of her exultation and the affirmation of her A<span

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="IV">IV Tissā.</span>

The following verse is that of Tissā, a student. Heaping up merit under
former Buddhas, Tissā was, in this Buddha-dispensation, reborn at
Kapilavatthu in the noble clan of the Sākiyas. Made a lady of the
Bodhisat's court, she renounced the world with Great Pajāpatī the
Gotamid, and practised herself in insight. To her the Master appeared as
to the foregoing Sisters, and said:

<table data-align="center">

<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong></strong>
<p><span id="4">O Tissā! train thyself in the trainings three.<br />

And fare thou forth purged of the deadly Drugs. <a href="pos06.htm#13-1"><sup>91</sup></a> (4)</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

And she, when she heard the verse, increased in insight, and attained
Arahantship. Thereafter she was wont to repeat the lines.

Of all these six Sisters the story is similar to that of Tissā
([IV.](pos06.htm#IV)), with this exception: Dhīrā, called '[another
Sister Dhīrā](pos06.htm#VII),' had no glory-verse pronounced to her, but
was troubled in heart at the Master's teaching. Leaning on his words,
she strove for insight, and when she had reached Arahantship, she
declaimed her verse in exultation. All the others did the same.

Muttā, heaping up good under former Buddhas, was, in this
Buddha-dispensation, born in the land of Kosala as the daughter of a
poor brahmin named Oghāṭaka. Come to proper age, she was given to a
hunchbacked brahmin; but she told him she could not continue in the life
of the house, and induced him to consent to her leaving the world.
Exercising herself in insight, her thoughts still ran on external
objects of interest. So she practised self-control, and, repeating her
verse, strove after insight till she won Arahantship; then exulting, she
repeated:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="XII">XII Dhammadinnā.</span>

Now, she, in the time when Padumuttara was Buddha, lived at Haŋsavatī in
a state of servitude; and because she ministered and did honour to one
of the chief apostles when he rose from his cataleptic trance, she was
reborn in heaven and so on, among gods and men, till Phussa was Buddha.
Then she worked merit by doubling the gift prescribed by her husband to
the Master's half-brothers while they were staying in a servant's house.
And when Kassapa was Buddha, she came to birth in the house of Kiki,
King of Kāsī, as one of the Seven Sisters, his
daughters,[<sup>101</sup>](pos06.htm#16-1) and for 20,000 years lived a
holy life. . . . Finally, in this Buddha-dispensation, she was reborn of
a clansman's family at Rājagaha, and became the wife of Visākha, a
leading citizen. Now one day her husband went to hear the Master
teaching, and became One-who-returns-no-more. When he came home,
Dhammadinnā met him as he went up the stairs; but he leant not on her
outstretched hand, nor spoke to her at supper. And she asked: 'Dear sir,
why did you not take my hand? Why do you not talk to me? Have I done
anything amiss?' ''Tis for no fault in you, Dhammadinnā; but from
henceforth I am not fit to touch a woman or take pleasure in food, for
of such is the doctrine now borne in upon me. Do you according as you
wish, either continuing to dwell here, or taking as much wealth as you
need and going back to your family.' 'Nay, dear sir, I will make no such
goings back. Suffer me to leave the world.' 'It is well, Dhammadinnā,'
replied Visākha, and sent her to the Bhikkhunīs in a golden palanquin.
Admitted to the Order, she shortly after asked permission of her
teachers to go into retreat, saying: 'Mothers, my heart hath no delight
in a place of crowds; I would go into a village abode.' The Bhikkhunīs
brought her thither, and while there, because in her past lives she had
subjugated the complexities of thought, word, and deed, she soon
attained Arahantship, together with thorough mastery of the form and
meaning of the Dhamma.[<sup>102</sup>](pos06.htm#17-1) Thereupon she
thought: 'Now have I reached the summit. What shall I do here any
longer? I will even go to Rājagaha and worship the Master, and many of
my kinsfolk will, through me, acquire merit.' So she returned with her
Bhikkhunīs. Then Visākha, hearing of her return, curious to know why she
came, interviewed her with questions on the Khandhas and the like. And
Dhammadinnā answered every question as one might cut a lotus-stalk with
a knife, and finally referred him to the Master. The Master praised her
great wisdom, as it is told in the Lesser Vedalla (Miscellany)
Sutta,[<sup>103</sup>](pos06.htm#17-2) and ranked her foremost among the
Sisters who could preach.

But it was while she was dwelling in the country, and, while yet in the
lowest path, was acquiring insight to reach the highest, that she
uttered her verse:

(*Who left the world when old*).

She too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up
good in this life and in that, was, in this Buddha-dispensation, born at
Sāvatthī as the sister of the King of Kosala. Hearing the Master preach
the doctrine to the King Pasenadi in the discourse beginning, 'There are
four young creatures, sire, who may not be disregarded,'
[<sup>112</sup>](pos06.htm#19-5) she believed, and was established in
the Refuges and the Precepts. Fain to leave the world, she put off doing
so that she might take care of her grandmother as long as she lived.
After the grandmother's death, Sumanā went, accompanied by the King, to
the Vihāra, taking much treasure in carpets and shawls, and presenting
them to the Order. And hearing the Master teach, she attained the fruit
of the Path of No-return, and asked for ordination. And the Master,
discerning the maturity of her knowledge, spake thus:

And when he had finished, she won Arahantship, together with thorough
knowledge of the Norm in form and in meaning.
[<sup>113</sup>](pos06.htm#20-1) In her exultation she uttered that same
verse, so that it became the announcement of her A<span

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up
merit in this and that state of becoming, was, in this
Buddha-dispensation, born in a respectable family at Sāvatthī. Given in
marriage to a suitable husband, she became converted, and desired to
leave the world, but her husband would not consent. So she waited till
after his death, and then entered the Order. One day, returning to the
Vihāra from seeking alms, she lost her balance and fell. Making just
that her base of insight, she won Arahantship with thorough knowledge of
the Norm in form and in meaning. [<sup>114</sup>](pos06.htm#21-1) And,
triumphing, she uttered this verse:
