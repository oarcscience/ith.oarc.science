S<span class="small">HE</span> also, heaping up good like the foregoing,
was born, in the time of Vipassi Buddha, as a fairy on the banks of the
River Candabhāgā.[<sup>146</sup>](pos08.htm#34-1.md) Devoted to fairy
pastimes, she saw one day the Master walking on the bank, that he might
sow the good seed among creatures. And with great glee she worshipped,
offering flowers.[<sup>147</sup>](pos08.htm#34-2.md) For this she gained
rebirth among gods and men, till, in this Buddha-dispensation, she took
birth in a clansman's family at Kosambī. She too became the friend of
Sāmāvatī, and she too, out of grief at the death of the latter, entered
the Order. She too could not gain self-mastery for twenty-five years,
till in her old age she heard a timely sermon, through which her insight
expanded and she won Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Dhamma in
form and meaning. Thereon reflecting, she broke forth:

She, too, heaping up good under former Buddhas, was in the time of
Vipassi Buddha, born at Bandhumatī, in the house of a certain wealthy
landowner, and became a domestic servant. Grown up, she tended her
master's household. Now, at that time, King Bandhumā (Vipassi's father),
having restored Sabbath-keeping, gave gifts before dining and, after
dining, attended a sermon; and the people, following his pious example,
and keeping Sabbath, the slave thought: 'Why should not I, too, do as
they all are doing?' And for the thoroughness of her observance of the
feasts she was reborn among the Three-and-Thirty gods, and in other
happy realms, and finally, in this Buddha-era, in the house of the
Treasurer of Sāvatthī. Come to years of discretion, she heard Paṭācārā
preach, and entered the Order; but she was unable to attain the climax
of insight till Paṭācārā,[<sup>149</sup>](pos08.htm#35-2.md) seeing the
state of her mind, gave her admonition. Thereby established, she won
Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and in meaning. And
reflecting thereon, she exulted thus:

### <span id="XXXI">XXXI Another Uttamā.</span>

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up
good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, was born, in the
time of Vipassi Buddha, as a domestic servant, at Bandhumatī. One day,
seeing an Arahant of the Master's Order seeking alms, she gladly offered
him three sweet cakes. Through this reborn to happiness, she finally
came to birth, in this Buddha-era, in the family of an eminent brahmin
in the country of Kosala. Come to years of discretion, she heard the
Master preach while touring in the country, and leaving the world, she
soon won Arahantship, together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form
and in meaning. And reflecting thereon, she exulted thus:

### <span id="XXXII">XXXII Dantikā.</span>

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and in this and
that rebirth heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy, was born, when
the world was empty of a Buddha, as a fairy by the River
Candabhāgā.[<sup>153</sup>](pos08.htm#37-3.md) Sporting one day with the
fairies, and straying awhile, she saw a silent Buddha seated at the foot
of a tree, and adored him in faith with flower-offerings. For this she
was reborn among gods and men, and, finally, in this Buddha-era, at
Sāvatthī, in the house of the King's chaplain-brahmin. Come to years of
discretion, she became a lay-believer in the Jeta Grove \[College\],
and, later, entered the Order under Great Pajāpatī the Gotamid. And one
day, while staying at Rājagaha, she ascended the Vulture's Peak, after
her meal, and while resting, she saw that which she tells of in her
verse, whereby she won Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Norm in
form and in meaning. And afterwards, thrilled with happiness at the
thought of her attainment, she exulted thus:

### <span id="XXXIII">XXXIII Ubbirī.</span>

She too, having made her resolve in the time of former Buddhas, and
heaping up, in this and that rebirth, Good valid for an æon of
evolution, was born, in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, at the town of
Haŋsavatī in a clansman's house. Come to years of discretion, she was
left alone one day, her parents being engaged with a party in the inner
court of the house. And seeing an Arahant approaching the house-door,
she bade him 'Come in hither, lord,' and did him homage, showing him to
a seat; she then took his bowl and filled it with food. The Elder
thanked her, and departed. But she, reborn therefore in the heaven of
the Three-and-Thirty gods, enjoying there a heavenly time and many a
happy life thereafter, was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at Sāvatthī in
the family of a very eminent burgess. And she was beautiful to see, and
was brought into the house of the King of Kosala
himself.[<sup>156</sup>](pos08.htm#39-1.md) After a few years a daughter
was born to her, whom she named Jīvā.[<sup>157</sup>](pos08.htm#39-2.md)
The King saw the child, and was so pleased that he had Ubbirī anointed
as Queen. But anon the little girl died, and the mother went daily
mourning to the charnel-field. And one day she went and worshipped the
Master, and sat down; but soon she left, and stood lamenting by the
River Achiravatī. Then the Master, seeing her from afar, revealed
himself, and asked her: 'Why dost thou weep?' 'I weep because of my
daughter, Exalted One.' 'Burnt in this cemetery are some 84,000
[<sup>158</sup>](pos08.htm#39-3.md) of thy daughters. For which of them
dost thou weep?' And pointing out the place where this one and that one
had been laid, he said half the psalm:

<table data-align="center">

<col style="width: 100%" />

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong></strong>
<p><span id="51">O Ubbirī, who wailest in the wood,<br />
Crying 'O Jīvā! O my daughter dear!'<br />
Come to thyself! Lo, in this burying-ground<br />
Are burnt full many a thousand daughters dear,<br />
And all of them were named like unto her.<br />
Now which of all those Jīvās dost thou mourn? (51)</span></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

And she pondered with intelligence on the Norm thus taught by the
Master, and so stirred up insight that, by the charm of his teaching and
her own attainment of the requisite conditions, she reached the topmost
fruit, even Arahantship.[<sup>159</sup>](pos08.htm#40-1.md) And showing
forth the high distinction she had won, she spoke the second half of the
psalm:

### <span id="XXXIV">XXXIV Sukkā.</span>

She, too, having fared in the past as the foregoing Sisters, was born in
a clansman's house. [<sup>162</sup>](pos08.htm#40-4.md) Come to years of
discretion, she went with lay-women disciples to the Vihāra,
[<sup>163</sup>](pos08.htm#40-5.md) and heard the Master preach. Becoming a
believer, she left the world and became learned, proficient in the
doctrine, and a ready speaker. Leading for centuries a religious life,
[<sup>164</sup>](pos08.htm#41-1.md) she yet died a worldling at heart, and
was reborn in the heaven of bliss.[<sup>165</sup>](pos08.htm#41-2.md)
Again, when Vipassi was Buddha, and again when Vessabhu was Buddha, she
kept the precepts, and was learned and proficient in doctrine. Again,
when Kakusandha was Buddha, and yet again when Konāgamana was Buddha,
she took Orders, and was pure in conduct, learnèd, and a preacher. At
length, she was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at Rājagaha, in the family
of an eminent burgess, and called Sukkā (bright, lustrous, 'Lucy'). Come
to years of discretion, she found faith in the Master at her own home,
and became a lay-disciple. But later, when she heard Dhammadinnā
preach,[<sup>166</sup>](pos08.htm#41-3.md) she was thrilled with emotion,
and renounced the world under her. And performing the exercises for
insight, she not long after attained Arahantship, together with thorough
grasp of the Norm in form and in meaning.

Thereupon, attended by 500 Bhikkhunīs, she became a great preacher. And
one day, when they had been into Rājagaha for alms, and had returned and
dined, they entered the Bhikkhunīs' settlement, and Sukkā, with a great
company seated around her, taught the doctrine in such wise that she
seemed to be giving them sweet mead to drink and sprinkling them with
ambrosia. And they all listened to her rapt, motionless, intent.
Thereupon the spirit[<sup>167</sup>](pos08.htm#41-4.md) of the tree that
stood at the end of the Sisters' terrace was inspired by her teaching,
and went out to Rājagaha, walking about the ways and the squares
proclaiming her excellence, and saying:

<table data-align="center">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong></strong>
<p><span id="54">What would ye men of Rājagaha have?<br />
What have ye done? that mute and idle here<br />
Ye lie about, as if bemused with wine,<br />
Nor wait upon Sukkā, while she reveals<br />
The precious gospel by the Buddha taught. (54)</span><br />
<span id="55">The wise in heart, methinks, were fain to quaff<br />
That life's elixir, once won never lost,<br />
That welleth ever up in her sweet words,<br />
E'en as the wayfarer welcomes the rain. (55)</span></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

And hearing what the tree-spirit said, the people were excited, and came
to the Sister and listened attentively.

At a later period, when the Sister, at the end of her life, was
completing her Nibbana, and wished to show how the system she had taught
led to salvation, she declared her A<span class="small">ÑÑĀ</span> thus:

### <span id="XXXV">XXXV Selā.</span>

She, too, having fared in the past as the foregoing Sisters, was born in
a clansman's house at Haŋsavatī, [<sup>169</sup>](pos08.htm#42-2.md) and
was given in marriage by her parents to a clansman's son of equal birth.
With him she lived happily till his death. Then, being herself advanced
in years, and growing anxious as she sought to find Good,
[<sup>170</sup>](pos08.htm#42-3.md) she went about from park to park,
[<sup>171</sup>](pos08.htm#42-4.md) from vihāra to vihāra, with the
intention of teaching religion (*dhamma*) to votaries of religion. Then
one day she came up to the Bo-tree of the Master
[<sup>172</sup>](pos08.htm#43-1.md) and sat down, thinking: 'If a Buddha,
an Exalted One, be unequalled and peerless among men, may this one show
me the miracle of Buddhahood.' Scarce had the thought arisen when the
Tree blazed forth, the branches appeared as if made of gold, the horizon
shone all around. And she, inspired at that sight, fell down and
worshipped, and for seven days sat there. On the seventh day she
performed a grand feast of offering and worship to the
Buddha.[<sup>173</sup>](pos08.htm#43-2.md) By this meritorious karma she
was reborn in this Buddha-era, in the kingdom of Āḷavī, as the King's
daughter, and named Selā. [<sup>174</sup>](pos08.htm#43-3.md) But she was
also known as 'The Āḷavikan.' [<sup>175</sup>](pos08.htm#43-4.md) Come to
years of discretion, the Master converted her father, ordained him, and
went with him to the city of Āḷavī. Selā, being yet unmarried, went with
the King and heard the Master preach. She became a believer and a
lay-disciple. Afterwards, growing anxious, she took Orders, worked her
way to insight, and because of the promise in her and the maturity of
her knowledge, she, crushing the formations of thought, word and
deed,[<sup>176</sup>](pos08.htm#43-5.md) soon won Arahantship.

Thereafter, as an Elder, she lived at Sāvatthī. And one day she went
forth from Sāvatthī to take siesta in the Dark Grove, and sat down
beneath a tree. Then Māra, alone and wishing to interrupt her privacy,
approached in the guise of a stranger, saying:

<table data-align="center">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Then the Sister–thinking: 'Verily, 'tis that foolish Māra who would deny
me the Nibbana that is revealed to me, and bids me choose the sensuous
life. He knows not that I am an Arahant. Now will I tell him and
confound him'– recited the following: [<sup>177</sup>](pos08.htm#44-1.md)

She, too, having fared in the past as the foregoing Sisters, was, in the
time of Sikhi Buddha, [<sup>179</sup>](pos08.htm#44-3.md) reborn in the
family of an eminent noble, and, when grown up, was made the chief
consort of the King Aruṇavā. The story of her past is similar to that of
Sister Abhayā. [<sup>180</sup>](pos08.htm#45-1.md) The story of her present
is that, in this Buddha-era, she was reborn as the daughter of the
chaplain of King Bimbisāra [<sup>181</sup>](pos08.htm#45-2.md) at Rājagaha,
and named Somā. Come to years of discretion, she came to believe in the
Master in her own home, and became a lay-disciple. And later on, growing
anxious, she entered the Order of Bhikkhunīs, and, working her way to
insight, she not long after won Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the
Norm in letter and in spirit.

Then, dwelling at Sāvatthī in the bliss of emancipation, she went forth
one day to take siesta in the Dark Grove, and sat down beneath a tree.
And Māra, alone, and wishing to interrupt her privacy, approached her,
invisible and in the air, saying:

To reach. With her two-finger consciousness<br />

For women, from the age of seven or eight, boiling rice at all times,
know not the moment when the rice is cooked, but must take some grains
in a spoon and press it with two fingers; hence the expression

Whose hearts are firmly set, who ever move<br />

What can that signify to one in whom<br />
Insight doth truly comprehend the Norm?</span> <a href="pos08.htm#45-4"><sup>183</sup></a> (61)<br />
<span id="62">On every hand the love of pleasure yields,<br />
And the thick gloom of ignorance is rent<br />

Here, O Destroyer! shalt thou not prevail. (62)</span></p></td>
