### SĀKETA-JĀTAKA.

"*The man thy mind rests on*."--This story was told by the Master, while
at Añjanavana, about a certain brahmin. Tradition says that when the
Blessed One with his disciples was entering the city of Sāketa, an old
brahmin of that place, who was going out, met him in the gateway.
Falling at the Buddha's feet, and clasping him by the ankles, the old
man cried, "Son, is it not the duty of children to cherish the old age
of their parents? \[309\] Why have you not let us see you all this long
time? At last I have seen you; come, let your mother see you too." So
saying, he took the Master with him to his house; and there the Master
sat upon the seat prepared for him, with his disciples around him. Then
came the brahmin's wife, and she too fell at the feet of the Blessed
One, crying, "My son, where have you been all this time? Is it not the
duty of children to comfort their parents in their old age?" Hereon, she
called to her sons and daughters that their brother was come, and made
them salute the Buddha. And in their joy the aged pair shewed great
hospitality to their guests. After his meal, the Master recited to the
old people the Sutta concerning old-age <span
id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_121.md); and, when he had ended, both husband
and wife won fruition of the Second Path. Then rising up from his seat,
the Master went back to Añjanavana.

Meeting together in the Hall of Truth, the Brethren fell to talking
about this thing. It was urged that the brahmin must have been well
aware that Suddhodana was the father, and Mahāmāyā the mother, of the
Buddha; yet none the less, he and his wife had claimed the Buddha as
their own son,--and that with the Master's assent. What could it all
mean? Hearing their talk, the Master said, "Brethren, the aged pair were
right in claiming me as their son." And so saying, he told this story of
the past.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Brethren, in ages past this brahmin was my father in 500 successive
births, my uncle in a like number, and in 500 more my grandfather. And

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

in 1500 successive births his wife was respectively my mother, my aunt,
and my grandmother. So I was brought up in 1500 births by this brahmin,
and in 1500 by his wife.

And therewithal, having told of these 3000 births, the Master, as
Buddha, recited this Stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The man thy mind rests on, with whom thy heart  
Is pleased at first sight,--place thy trust in him.

</div>

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[310\] His lesson ended, the Master shewed the connexion and identified
the Birth by saying, "This brahmin and his wife were the husband and
wife in all those existences, and I the child."
