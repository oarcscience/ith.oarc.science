"*With matted hair*."--This story was told by the boaster while at
Jetavana, about a hypocrite. The incidents were like those above
related <span id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_193.md).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta
was born a lizard; and in a but hard by a village on the borders there
lived a rigid ascetic who had attained the Five Knowledges, and was
treated with great respect by the villagers. In an ant-hill at the end
of the walk where the recluse paced up and down, dwelt the Bodhisatta,
and twice or thrice each day he would go to the recluse and hear words
of edification and holiness. Then with due obeisance to the good man,
the Bodhisatta would depart to his own abode. After a certain time the
ascetic bade farewell to the villagers and went away. In his stead there
came another ascetic, a rascally fellow, to dwell in the hermitage.
Assuming the holiness of the new-comer, the Bodhisatta acted towards him
as to the first ascetic. One day an unexpected storm in the dry season
brought out the ants on their hills <span
id="fr_195"></span>[2](#fn_194.md), and the lizards, coming abroad to eat
them, were caught in great numbers \[481\] by the village folk; and some
were served up with vinegar and sugar for the ascetic to eat. Pleased
with so savoury a dish, he asked what it was, and learned that it was a
dish of lizards. Hereon he reflected that he had a remarkably fine
lizard as his neighbour, and resolved to dine off him. Accordingly he
made ready the pot for cooking and sauce to serve the lizard in, and sat
at the door of his hut with a mallet hidden under his yellow robe,
awaiting the Bodhisatta's coming, with a studied air of perfect peace.
At evening the Bodhisatta came, and as he drew near, marked that the
hermit did not seem quite the same, but had a look about him that boded
no good. Snuffing up the wind which was blowing towards him from the
hermit's cell, the Bodhisatta smelt the smell of lizard's flesh, and at
once realised how the taste of lizard had made the ascetic want to kill
him with a mallet and eat him up. So he retired homeward without calling
on the ascetic. Seeing that the Bodhisatta did not come, the ascetic
judged that the lizard must have divined his plot, but marvelled how he
could have discovered it. Determined that the lizard should not escape,
he drew out the mallet and threw

it, just hitting the tip of the lizard's tail. Quick as thought the
Bodhisatta dashed into his fastness, and putting his head out by a
different hole to that by which he had gone in, cried, "Rascally
hypocrite, your garb of piety led me to trust you, but now I know your
villainous nature. What has a thief like you to do with hermit's
clothing?" Thus upbraiding the false ascetic, the Bodhisatta recited
this stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

With matted hair and garb of skin  
  Why ape th’ ascetic's piety?  
A saint without, thy heart within  
  Is choked with foul impurity <span id="fr_196"></span>[1](#fn_195.md).

</div>

\[482\] In this wise did the Bodhisatta expose the wicked ascetic, after
which he retired into his ant-hill. And the wicked ascetic departed from
that place.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

His lesson ended, the Master identified the Birth by saying, "The
hypocrite was the wicked ascetic of those days, Sāriputta the good
ascetic who lived in the hermitage before him, and I myself the lizard."
