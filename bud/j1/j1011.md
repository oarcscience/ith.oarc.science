### GĀMANI-JĀTAKA.

"*Their heart's desire*."--This story was told by the Master while at
Jetavana about a Brother who gave up persevering. In this Jātaka both
the Introductory Story and the Story of the Past will be given in the
Eleventh Book in connexion with the Saṃvara-jātaka <span
id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md);--the incidents are the same both for that
Jātaka and for this, but the stanzas are different.

Abiding stedfast in the counsels of the Bodhisatta, Prince Gāmani,
finding himself--though the youngest of a hundred brothers--surrounded
by those hundred brothers as a retinue and seated beneath the white
canopy of kingship,

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

contemplated his glory and thought--"All this glory I owe to my
teacher." And, in his joy, he burst into this heartfelt utterance:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Their heart's desire <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md) they reap, who
hurry not;  
Know, Gāmani, ripe excellence is thine.

</div>

\[137\] Seven or eight days after he had become king, all his brothers
departed to their own homes. King Gāmani, after ruling his kingdom in
righteousness, passed away to fare according to his deserts. The
Bodhisatta also passed away to fare according to his deserts.

His lesson ended, the Master preached the Truths, at the close whereof
the faint-hearted Brother won Arahatship. Having told the two stories,
the Master shewed the connexion linking them both together and
identified the Birth.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[30:1](j1011.htm#fr_41.md) As to the alternative of
the gloss ("phalāsā ti āsāphalam," *i.e.* "'the desire of the fruit'
means 'the fruit of the desire'") Professor Künte (Ceylon R. A. S. J.
1884) says--"the inversion requires a knowledge of metaphysical grammar
such as was not cultivated in India before the 6th century A.D. ..Ṭhe
gloss was written about the Brahminical and Jain revival."
