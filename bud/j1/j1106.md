"*If wise, thou ’lt loiter not*."--This story was told by the Master at
Jetavana about Anātha-piṇḍika. For we hear that Anātha-piṇḍika was
returning from the village of which he was headman, when he saw robbers
on the road. "It won't do to loiter by the way," thought he; "I must
hurry on to Sāvatthi." So he urged his oxen to speed \[413\] and got
safely into Sāvatthi. Next day he went to the monastery and told the
Master what had befallen him. "Sir," said the Master, "in other times
too the wise and good espied robbers on the road and hastened without
delay to their homes." Then at the merchant's request he told this story
of the past.

Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta
was a rich merchant, who had been to a village to collect his dues and
was on his homeward way when he saw robbers on the road. At once he
urged his oxen to their topmost speed and reached home in safety. And as
he sat on his couch of state after a rich repast, he exclaimed, "I have
escaped from the robbers' hand to mine own house, where fear dwells
not." And in his thankfulness he uttered this stanza:--

If wise, thou 'lt loiter not 'mid enemies;  
A night or two with such brings miseries.

</div>

So, from the fulness of his heart, spake the Bodhisatta, and after a
life of charity and other good deeds he passed away to fare according to
his deserts.

His story ended, the Master identified the Birth by saying, "I was the
merchant of Benares of those days."
