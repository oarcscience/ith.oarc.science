"*Go not too far*."--This story was told by the Master while at
Jetavana, about a certain self-willed Brother. Asked by the Master
whether the report was true that he was self-willed, the Brother said it
was true. "This is net the first time, Brother," said the Master, "that
you have shewn yourself self-willed; you were just the same in bygone
times as well." And so saying, he told this story of the past.

Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta
came to life as a drummer, and dwelt in a village. Hearing that there
was to be a festival at Benares, and hoping to make money by playing his
drum to the crowds of holiday-makers, he made his way to the city, with
his son. And there he played, and made a great deal of money. On his way
home with his earnings he had to pass through a forest which was
infested by robbers; and as the boy kept beating away at the drum
without ever stopping, the Bodhisatta tried to stop him by saying,
"Don't behave like that, beat only now and again,--as if some great lord
were passing by."

But in defiance of his father's bidding, the boy thought the best way to
frighten the robbers away was to keep steadily on beating away at the
drum.

&t the first notes of the drum, away scampered the robbers, thinking
some great lord was passing by. But hearing the noise keep on, they saw
their mistake and came back to find out who it really was. Finding only
two persons, they beat and robbed them. "Alas!" cried the Bodhisatta,
"by your ceaseless drumming you have lost all our hard-earned takings!"
And, so saying, he repeated this stanza:

Go not too far, but learn excess to shun;  
For over-drumming lost what drumming won. \[284\]

His lesson ended, the Master shewed the connexion and identified the
Birth by saying, "This self-willed Brother was the son of those days,
and I myself the father."
