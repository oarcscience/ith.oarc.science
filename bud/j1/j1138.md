"*Who sagely meditates*."--This story too was told by the Master while
at Jetavana about the interpretation of a problem by the Elder Sāriputta
at the gate of Saṁkassa.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta,
as he expired in his forest-home, answered his disciples' enquiries with
the words--"Moonlight and Sunlight." With these words he died and passed
to the Radiant Realm.

Now when the chief disciple interpreted the Master's words his fellows
did not believe him. Then back came the Bodhisatta and from mid-air
recited this stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Who sagely meditates on sun and moon,  
Shall win (when Reason unto Ecstasy  
Gives place) his after-lot in Radiant Realms <span
id="fr_192"></span>[1](#fn_191.md).

</div>

Such was the Bodhisatta's teaching, and, first praising his disciple, he
went his way back to the Brahma Realm.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

His lesson ended, the Master identified the Birth by saying, "Sāriputta
was the chief disciple of those days, and I Mahā-Brahmā."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_191"></span>[292:1](j1138.htm#fr_192.md) These technical lines
imply that, by taking the Sun and Moon as his *kammaṭṭhāna*, or subject
for meditation, a Buddhist, by attaining Jhāna (or Insight) in the
second (*i.e.* supra-rational) degree, can save himself from re-birth in
a lower sphere of existence than the Ābhassaraloka or Radiant Realm of
the corporeal Brahma-world.
