"*Go not too far*."--This story was told by the Master while at
Jetavana, about another self-willed person.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta
came to life as a conch-blower, and went up to Benares with his father
to a public festival. There he earned a great deal of money by his
conch-blowing, and started for home again. On his way through a forest
which was infested by robbers, he warned his father not to keep on
blowing his conch; but the old man thought he knew better how to keep
the robbers off, and blew away hard without a moment's pause.
Accordingly, just as in the preceding story, the robbers returned and
plundered the pair. And, as above, the Bodhisatta repeated this stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Go not too far, but learn excess to shun;  
For over-blowing lost what blowing won.

</div>

His lesson ended, the Master shewed the connexion and identified the
Birth by saying, "This self-willed Brother was the father of those days,
and I myself his son."
