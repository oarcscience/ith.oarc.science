### MITTAVINDA-JĀTAKA.

"No more to dwell."--This story was told by the Master while at
Jetavana, about a self-willed Brother. The incidents of this Birth,
which took place in the days of the Buddha Kassapa, will be related in
the Tenth Book in the Mahā-Mittavindaka Jātaka <span

Then the Bodhisatta uttered this Stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

No more to dwell in island palaces  
Of crystal, silver, or of sparkling gems,--  
With flinty headgear thou’rt invested now;  
Nor shall its griding torture ever cease  
Till all thy sin be purged and life shall end.

</div>

So saying, the Bodhisatta passed to his own abode among the Devas. And
Mittavindaka, having donned that headgear, suffered grievous torment
till his sin had been spent and he passed away to fare according to his
deserts.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

His lesson ended, the Master identified the Birth, by saying, "This
self-willed Brother was the Mittavindaka of those days, and I myself the
King of the Devas."
