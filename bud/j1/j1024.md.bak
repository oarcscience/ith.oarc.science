\[173\] "*The antelope knows well*."--This story was told by the Master
while at the Bamboo-grove about Devadatta. For once when the Brethren
were gathered together in the Hall of Truth, they sat talking
reproachfully of Devadatta, saying, "Sirs, with a view to destroy the
Buddha Devadatta hired bowmen, hurled down a rock, and let loose the
elephant Dhana-pālaka; in every way he goes about to slay the Lord of
Wisdom <span id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_68.md)." Entering and seating
himself on the seat prepared for him, the Master asked, saying, "Sirs,
what is the theme you are discussing here in conclave?" "Sir," was the
reply, "we were discussing the wickedness of Devadatta, saying that he
was always going about to slay you." Said the Master, "It is not only in
these present days, Brethren, that Devadatta goes about seeking to slay
me; he went about with the like intent in bygone days also,--but was
unable to slay me." And so saying, he told this story of the past.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta
came to life as an antelope, and used to live on fruits in his haunts in
the forest.

At one period he was subsisting on the fruit of a sepaṇṇi-tree. And
there was a village hunter, whose method was to build a platform in
trees at the foot of which he found the track of deer, and to watch
aloft for their coming to eat the fruits of the trees. When the deer
came, he brought them down with a javelin, and sold the flesh for a
living. This hunter one day marked the tracks of the Bodhisatta at the
foot of the tree, and made himself a platform up in the boughs. Having
breakfasted early, he went with his javelin into the forest and seated
himself on his platform. The Bodhisatta, too, came abroad early to eat
the fruit of that tree; but he was not in too great a hurry to approach
it. "For," thought he to himself, "sometimes these platform-building
hunters build themselves platforms in the boughs. Can it be that this
cell have happened here?" And he halted some way off to reconnoitre.
Finding that the Bodhisatta did not approach, the hunter, still seated
aloft on his platform, \[174\] threw fruit down in front of the
antelope. Said the latter to himself, "Here's the fruit coming to meet
me; I wonder if there is a hunter up there." So he looked, and looked,
till he caught sight of the hunter in the tree; but, feigning not to
have seen the man, he shouted, "My worthy tree, hitherto you have been
in the habit of letting your fruit fall straight to

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

the ground like a pendant creeper; but to-day you have ceased to act
like a tree. And therefore, as you have ceased to behave as becomes a
tree, I too must change, and look for food beneath another tree." And so
saying, he repeated this stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The antelope knows well the fruit you drop.  
I like it not; some other tree I'll seek <span
id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69.md).

</div>

Then the hunter from his platform hurled his javelin at the Bodhisatta,
crying, "Begone! I've missed you this time." Wheeling round, the
Bodhisatta halted and said, "You may have missed *me*, my good man; but
depend upon it, you have not missed the reward of your conduct, namely,
the eight Large and the sixteen Lesser hells and all the five forms of
bonds and torture." With these words the antelope bounded off on its
way; and the hunter, too, climbed down and went his way.

When the Master had ended this discourse and had repeated what he had
said about Devadatta's going about to slay him in bygone days also, he
showed the connexion and identified the Birth, by saying, "Devadatta was
the platform-hunter of those days, and I myself the antelope."
