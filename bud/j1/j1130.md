### KALAṆḌUKA-JĀTAKA.

"*You vaunt*."--This story was told by the Master once at Jetavana,
about a boastful Brother. (The introductory story and the story of the
past in this case are like those of Kaṭāhaka related above <span
id="fr_184"></span>[1](#fn_183)..md)

Kalaṇḍuka was in this case the name of the slave of the Treasurer of
Benares. And when he had run away and was living in luxury with the
daughter of the border-merchant, the Treasurer missed him and could not
discover his whereabouts. So he sent a young pet parrot to search for
the runaway. And off flew the parrot in quest of Kalaṇḍuka, and searched
for him far and wide, till at last the bird came to the town where he
dwelt. And just at that very time Kalaṇḍuka was enjoying himself on the
river with his wife in a boat well-stocked with dainty fare and with
flowers and perfumes. Now the nobles of that land at their water-parties
make a point of taking milk with a pungent drug to drink, and so escape
suffering from cold after their pastime on the water. \[459\] But when
our Kalaṇḍuka tasted this milk, he hawked and spat it out; and in so
doing spat on the head of the merchant's daughter. At this moment up
flew the parrot, and saw all this from the bough of a fig-tree on the
bank. "Come, come,

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

slave Kalaṇḍuka," cried the bird; "remember who and what you are, and
don't spit on the head of this young gentlewoman. Know your place,
fellow." So saying, he uttered the following stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

You vaunt your high descent, your high degree,  
With lying tongue. Though but a bird, I know  
The truth. You'll soon be caught, you runaway.  
Scorn not the milk then, slave Kalaṇḍuka.

</div>

Recognizing the parrot, Kalaṇḍuka grew afraid of being exposed, and
exclaimed, "Ah! good master, when did you arrive?"

Thought the parrot, "It is not friendliness, but a wish to wring my
neck, that prompts this kindly interest." So he replied that he did not
stand in need of Kalaṇḍuka's services, and flew off to Benares, where he
told the Lord Treasurer everything he had seen.

"The rascal!" cried the Treasurer, and ordered Kalaṇḍuka to be hauled
back to Benares where he had once more to put up with a slave's fare.

His lesson ended, the Master identified the Birth by saying, "This
Brother was Kalaṇḍuka in the story, and I the Treasurer of Benares."
