"*’Tis knowledge*."--This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana
about one who spoiled spirits.. Tradition says that Anātha-piṇḍika had a
friend who kept a tavern. This friend got ready a supply of strong
spirits which he sold for gold and for silver <span
id="fr_102"></span>[1](#fn_102.md), and his tavern was crowded. He gave
orders to his apprentice to sell for cash only, and went off himself to
bathe. This apprentice, while serving out the grog to his customers,
observed them sending out for salt and jagghery and eating it as a whet.
Thought he to himself; "There can't be any salt in our liquor; I'll put
some in." So he put a pound of salt in a bowl of grog, and served it out
to the customers. And they no sooner took a mouthful, than they spat it
out again, saying, "What have you been up to?" "I saw you sending for
salt after drinking our liquor, so I mixed some salt in." "And that's
how you've spoilt good liquor, you booby," cried the customers, and with
abuse they got up one after another and flung out of the tavern. When
the keeper of the tavern came home, and did not see \[252\] a single
customer about, he asked where they had all got to. So the apprentice
told him what had happened. Rating him for his folly, the man went off
and told Anātha-piṇḍika. And the latter, thinking the story a good one
to tell, repaired to Jetavana, where after due obeisance he told the
Master all about it.

"This is not the first time, layman," said the Master, "that this
apprentice has spoiled spirits. He did just the same once before." Then
at Anātha-piṇḍika's request, he told this story of the past.

Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta
was the Treasurer of Benares, and had a tavern-keeper who lived under
his protection. This man having got ready a supply of strong spirits,
which he left his apprentice <span id="fr_103"></span>[2](#fn_103.md) to
sell while he himself went off to bathe, during his absence his
apprentice mixed salt with the liquor, and spoiled it just in the same
way. When on his return the young man's guide and master <span
id="fr_104"></span>[2](#fn_103.md) came to know what had been done, he told
the story to the Treasurer. 'Truly,' said the latter, the ignorant and
foolish, with every desire to do good, only succeed in doing harm.' And
he recited this stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

’Tis knowledge crowns endeavour with success;  
For fools are thwarted by their foolishness,  
-Witness Koṇḍañña's salted bowl of grog.

</div>

In these lines the Bodhisatta taught the truth.

Said the Master, "Layman, this same person spoiled spirits in the past
as now." Then he shewed the connexion and identified the Birth by
saying, "He who spoiled the spirits now was also the spoiler of the
spirits in those bygone days, and I myself was then the Treasurer of
Benares."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_102"></span>[120:1](j1050.htm#fr_102.md) Apparently regarded
as a 'Jewish' proceeding, as opposed to normal barter.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[120:2](j1050.htm#fr_104.md) With a dry humour,
the Pāli applies to the publican and his apprentice the terms normally
applied to a religious teacher and his pupil.
