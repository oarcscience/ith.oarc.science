### RUKKHADHAMMA-JĀTAKA.

"*United, forest-like*."--This story was told by the Master while at
Jetavana, about a quarrel concerning water which had brought woe upon
his kinsfolk. Knowing of this, he passed through the air, sat
cross-legged above the river Rohiṇī, and emitted rays of darkness,
startling his kinsfolk. Then descending from mid-air, he seated himself
on the river-bank and told this story with reference to that quarrel.
(Only a summary is given here; the full details will be related in the
Kuṇāla-jātaka <span id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_130)..md) But on this
occasion the Master addressed his kinsfolk, \[328\] saying, "It is meet,
sire, that kinsfolk should dwell together in concord and unity. For,
when kinsfolk are at one, enemies find no opportunity. Not to speak of
human beings, even sense-lacking trees ought to stand together. For in
bygone days in the Himalayas a tempest struck a Sāl-forest; yet, because
the trees, shrubs, bushes, and creepers of that forest were interlaced
one with another, the tempest could not overthrow even a single tree but
passed harmlessly over their heads. But alone in a courtyard stood a
mighty tree; and though it had many stems and branches, yet, because it
was not united with other trees, the tempest uprooted it and laid it
low. Wherefore, it is meet that you too should dwell together in concord
and unity." And so saying, at their request he told this story of the
past.

Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the first King
Vessavaṇa <span id="fr_132"></span>[1](#fn_131.md) died, and Sakka sent a
new king to reign in his stead. After the change, the new King Vessavaṇa
sent word to all trees and shrubs and bushes and plants, bidding the
tree-fairies each choose out the abode that liked them best. In those
days the Bodhisatta had come to life as a tree-fairy in a Sāl-forest in
the Himalayas. His advice to his kinsfolk in choosing their habitations
was to shun trees that stood alone in the open, and to take up their
abodes all round the abode which he had chosen in that Sāl-forest.
Hereon the wise tree-fairies, following the Bodhisatta's advice, took up
their quarters round his tree. But the foolish ones said,--"Why should
we dwell in the forest? let us rather seek out the haunts of men, and
take up our abodes outside villages, towns, or capital cities. For
fairies who dwell in such places receive the richest offerings and the
greatest worship." So they departed to the haunts of men, and took up
their abode in certain giant trees which grew in an open space.

Now it fell out upon a day that a mighty tempest swept over the country.
Naught did it avail the solitary trees that years had rooted them deep
in the soil and that they were the mightiest trees that grew. Their
branches snapped; their stems were broken; and they themselves were
uprooted and flung to earth by the tempest. But when it broke on the
Sāl-forest of interlacing trees, its fury was in vain; for, attack where
it might, not a tree could it overthrow.

The forlorn fairies whose dwellings were destroyed, took their children
in their arms and journeyed to the Himalayas. There they told their
sorrows to the fairies of the Sāl-forest, \[329\] who in turn told the
Bodhisatta of their sad return. "It was because they hearkened not to
the words of wisdom, that they have been brought to this," said he; and
he unfolded the truth in this stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

United, forest-like, should kinsfolk stand;  
The storm o’erthrows the solitary tree.

</div>

So spake the Bodhisatta; and when his life was spent, he passed away to
fare according to his deserts.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

And the Master went on to say, "Thus, sire, reflect how meet it is that
kinsfolk at any rate should be united, and lovingly dwell together in
concord and unity." His lesson ended, the Master identified the Birth by
saying, "The Buddha's followers were the fairies of those days, and I
myself the wise fairy."
