### ROHIṆĪ-JĀTAKA.

"*Sense-lacking friends*."--This story was told by the Master while at
Jetavana, about a maid servant of the Lord High Treasurer,
Anātha-piṇḍika. For he is said to have had a maid-servant named Rohiṇī,
whose aged mother came to where the girl was pounding rice, and lay
down. The flies came round the old woman and stung her as with a needle,
so she cried to her daughter, "The flies are stinging me, my dear; do
drive them away." "Oh! I'll drive them away, mother," said the girl,
lifting her pestle to the flies which had settled on her mother. Then,
crying, "I'll kill them!", she smote her mother such a blow as to kill
the old woman outright. Seeing what she had done the girl began to weep
and cry, "Oh! mother, mother!"

The news was brought to the Lord High Treasurer, who, after having the
body burnt, went his way to the Monastery, and told the Master what had
happened. "This is not the first time, layman," said the Master, "that
in Rohiṇī's anxiety to kill the flies on her mother, she has struck her
mother dead with a pestle; she did precisely the same in times past."
Then at Anātha-piṇḍika's request, he told this story of the past.

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta was born the son of the Lord High Treasurer, and came to be
Lord High Treasurer himself at his father's death. And he, too, had a
maid-servant whose name was Rohiṇī. And her mother, in like manner, went
to where the daughter was pounding rice, and lay down, and called

out, 'Do drive these flies off me, my dear,' and in just the same way
she struck her mother with a pestle, and killed her, and began to weep.

Hearing of what had happened, \[249\] the Bodhisatta reflected: 'Here,
in this world, even an enemy, with sense, would be preferable,' and
recited these lines:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Sense-lacking friends are worse than foes with sense,  
Witness the girl whose reckless hand laid low  
Her mother, whom she now laments in vain.

</div>

In these lines in praise of the wise, did the Bodhisatta preach the
Truth.

"This is not the first time, layman," said the Master, "that in Rohiṇī's
anxiety to kill flies she has killed her own mother instead." This
lesson ended, he shewed the connexion and identified the Birth by
saying:--"The mother and daughter of to-day were also mother and
daughter of those bygone times, and I myself the Lord High Treasurer."
