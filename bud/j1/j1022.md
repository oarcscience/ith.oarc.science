\[169\] "*Take thought of life hereafter*." This story was told by the
Master while at Jetavana about the offering of a sacrifice under vow to
gods. Tradition says that in those days folk when going a journey on
business, used to slay living creatures and offer them as a sacrifice to
gods, and set out on their way, after making this vow,--"If we come
safely back with a profit, we will give you another sacrifice." And when
they did come safely back with a profit, the Idea that this was all due
to gods made them slay a number of living creatures and offer them up as
a sacrifice to obtain a release from their vow.

When the Brethren became aware of this, they asked the Blessed One,
saying, "Can there be any good in this, sir?"

The Blessed One told this story of the past.

Once on a time in the Kāsi country the squire of a certain little
village had promised a sacrifice to the Fairy of a banyan-tree which
stood at the entrance to the village. Afterwards when he returned, he
slew a number

of creatures and betook himself to the tree to get released from his
vow. But the Tree-Fairy, standing in the fork of its tree, repeated this
stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Take thought of life hereafter when you seek  
'Release'; for this release is bondage strict.  
Not thus the wise and good release themselves;  
For this, the fool's release, in bondage ends.

</div>

Thenceforth, men refrained from such taking of life, and by walking in
righteousness thronged thereafter the city of the Devas.

His lesson ended, the Master shewed the connexion and identified the
Birth, by saying, "I was the Tree-fairy of those days."
