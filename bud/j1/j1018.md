"*For when a deer*."--This story was told by the Master while at
Jetavana about an unruly Brother. Tradition says that this Brother was
unruly and would not heed admonition. Accordingly, the Master asked him,
saying, "Is it true, as they say, that you are unruly and will not heed
admonition?"

"It is true, Blessed One," was the reply.

"So too in bygone days," said the Master, "you were unruly and would not
heed the admonition of the wise and good,--with the result that you were
caught in a gin and met your death." And so saying, he told this story
of the past.

Once on a time when Brahmadatta was in Benares the Bodhisatta was born a
deer and dwelt in the forest at the head of a herd of deer. His sister
brought her son to him, saying, "Brother, this is your nephew; teach him
deer's ruses." And thus she placed her son under the Bodhisatta's care.
Said the latter to his nephew, "Come at such and such a time and I will
give you a lesson." But the nephew made no appearance at the time
appointed. And, as on that day, so on seven days did he skip his lesson
and fail to learn the ruses of deer; and at last, as he was roaming
about, he was caught in a gin. His mother came and said to the
Bodhisatta, "Brother, was not your nephew taught deer's ruses?"

"Take no thought for the unteachable rascal," said the Bodhisatta;
\[160\] "your son failed to learn the ruses of deer." And so saying,
having lost all desire to advise the scapegrace even in his deadly
peril, he repeated this stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

For when a deer has twice four hoofs to run  
And branching antlers armed with countless tines,  
And when by seven tricks he's saved himself,  
I teach him then, Kharādiyā, no more.

</div>

But the hunter killed the self-willed deer that was caught in the snare,
and departed with its flesh.

When the Master had ended this lesson in support of what he had said as
to the unruliness of the Brother in bygone days as well as in the
present, he shewed the connexion, and identified the Birth, by saying
"In those days this unruly Brother was the nephew-deer,
Uppala-vaṇṇā <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58) was the sister, and I
myself the deer who gave the admonition."

\[*Note*. In the *gāthā* I have translated not the meaningless *kālāhi*
of Fausböll's text, nor the easy variant *kālehi*, which is substituted
in the gloss, but *kalāhi*, the more difficult reading which occurs in
some Sinhalese MSS, and which is read by Fausböll in the analogous story
No. [16](j1019.htm#an_j016). This reading is also given by Dickson in J.
R. A. S. Ceylon, 1884, p. 188, from the Jātaka Pela Sanne. If *kālehi*
be read, the translation becomes, "I do not try to teach one who has
played truant seven times." In the J. R. A. S. Ceylon, 1884, p. 125,
Künte says, "I have little doubt that *kalāhi* is the original form of
the popular sing-song, and *kālehi* a mistake for it, and that on this
mistake the grammarian compiler has built up his silly little story
about the deer who would not go to school."\]

<span id="fn_58"></span>[47:1](j1018.htm#fr_58) See the interesting Life
of this *therī* in Mrs Bode's 'Women Leaders of the Buddhist
Reformation' (J. R. A. S. 1893, pp. 540-552), where it is explained that
Uppala-vaṇṇā "came by that name because she had a skin like the colour
in the heart of the dark-blue lotus."
