"*Speak kindly*."--This story was told by the Master while at Sāvatthi,
about the precept touching abusive language. The introductory story and
the story of the past are the same as in the Nandivisāla-jātaka
above <span id="fr_149"></span>[1](#fn_148).

But in this case \[375\] there is the difference that the Bodhisatta was
an ox named Sārambha, and belonged to a brahmin of Takkasilā in the
kingdom

of Gandhāra. After telling the story of the past, the Master, as Buddha,
uttered this stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Speak kindly, revile not your fellow;  
Love kindness; reviling breeds sorrow.

</div>

When the Master had ended his lesson he identified the Birth by saying,
"Ānanda was the brahmin of those days, Uppalavaṇṇā his wife, and I
Sārambha."
