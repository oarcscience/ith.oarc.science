### RĀDHA-JĀTAKA.

"*How many more?*"--This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana,
about hankering after the wife of one's mundane life. The incidents of
the introductory story will be told in the Indriya-jātaka <span
id="fr_206"></span>[1](#fn_205.md).

The Master spoke thus to the Brother, "It is impossible to keep a guard
over a woman; no guard can keep a woman in the right path. You yourself
found in former days that all your safeguards were unavailing; and how
can you now expect to have more success?"

And so saying, he told this story of the past.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta
was born a parrot. A certain brahmin in the Kāsi country was as a father
to him and to his younger brother, treating them like his own children.
Poṭṭhapāda was the Bodhisatta's name, and Rādha his brother's.

Nov the brahmin had a bold bad wife. And as he was leaving home on
business, he said to the two brothers, "If your mother, my wife, is
minded to be naughty, stop her." "We will, papa," said the Bodhisatta,
"if we can; \[496\] but if we can't, we will hold our peace."

Having thus entrusted his wife to the parrots' charge, the brahmin set
out on his business. Every day thenceforth his wife misconducted
herself; there was no end to the stream of her lovers in and out of the
house. Moved by the sight, Rādha said to the Bodhisatta, "Brother, the
parting injunction of our father was to stop any misconduct on his
wife's part, and now she does nothing but misconduct herself. Let us
stop her."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Brother," said
the Bodhisatta, "your words are the words of folly. You might carry a
woman about in your arms and yet she would not be safe. So do not essay
the impossible." And so saying he uttered this stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

How many more shall midnight bring? Your plan  
Is idle. Naught but wifely love could curb  
Her lust; and wifely love is lacking quite.

</div>

And for the reasons thus given, the Bodhisatta did not allow his brother
to speak to the brahmin's wife, who continued to gad about to her
heart's content during her husband's absence. On his return, the brahmin
asked Poṭṭhapāda about his wife's conduct, and the Bodhisatta faithfully
related all that had taken place.

"Why, father," he said, "should you have anything more to do with so
wicked a woman?" And he added these words,--"My father, now that I have
reported my mother's wickedness, we can dwell here no longer." So
saying, he bowed at the brahmin's feet and flew away with Rādha to the
forest.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

His lesson ended, the Master taught the Four Truths, at the close
whereof the Brother who hankered after the wife of his mundane life was
established in the fruition of the first Path.

"This husband and wife," said the Master, "were the brahmin and his wife
of those days, Ānanda was Rādha, and I myself Poṭṭhapāda."
