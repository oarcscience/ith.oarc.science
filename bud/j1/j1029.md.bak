### MAHILĀMUKHA-JĀTAKA.

"*Through hearing first*."--This story was told by the Master while at
the Bamboo-grove, about Devadatta, who, having secured the adherence of
Prince Ajāta-sattu, had attained both gain and honour. Prince
Ajāta-sattu had a Monastery built for Devadatta at Gayā-sīsa, and every
day brought to him \[186\] five hundred kettles of perfumed
three-year-old rice flavoured with all the choicest flavourings. All
this gain and honour brought Devadatta a great following, with whom
Devadatta lived on, without ever stirring out of his Monastery.

At that time there were living in Rājagaha two friends, of whom one had
taken the vows under the Master, whilst the other had taken them under
Devadatta. And these continued to see one another, either casually or by
visiting the Monasteries. Now one day the disciple of Devadatta said to
the other, "Sir, why do you daily go round for alms with the sweat
streaming off you? Devadatta sits quietly at Gayā-sīsa and feeds on the
best of fare, flavoured with all the choicest flavourings. There's no
way like his. Why breed misery for yourself? Why should it not be a good
thing for you to come the first thing in the morning to the Monastery at
Gayā-sīsa and there drink our rice-gruel with a relish after it, try our
eighteen kinds of solid victual, and enjoy our excellent soft food,
flavoured with all the choicest flavourings?"

Being pressed time after time to accept the invitation, the other began
to want to go, and thenceforth used to go to Gayā-sīsa and there eat and
eat, not forgetting however to return to the Bamboo-grove at the proper
hour. Nevertheless he could not keep it secret always; and in a little
while it came out that he used to hie off to Gayā-sīsa and there regale
himself with the food provided for Devadatta. Accordingly, his friends
asked him, saying, "Is it true, as they say, that you regale yourself on
the food provided for Devadatta?" "Who said that?" said he. "So-and-so
said it." "It is true, sirs, that I go to Gayā-sīsa and eat there. But
it is not Devadatta who gives me food; others do that." "Sir, Devadatta
is the foe of the Buddhas; in his wickedness, he has secured the
adherence of Ajāta-sattu and by unrighteousness got gain and honour for
himself. Yet you who have taken the vows according to this faith which
leads to salvation, eat the food which Devadatta gets by
unrighteousness. Come; let us bring you before the Master." And, taking
with them the Brother, they went to the Hall of Truth.

When the Master became aware of their presence, he said, "Brethren, are
you bringing this Brother here against his will?" "Yes, sir; this
Brother, after taking the vows under you, eats the food which Devadatta
gets by unrighteousness." "Is it true, as they say, that you eat the
food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness?" "It was not Devadatta,
sir, that gave it me, but others." "Raise no quibbles here, Brother,"
said the Master. "Devadatta is a man of bad conduct and bad principle.
Oh, how could you, who have taken the vows here, eat Devadatta's food,
whilst adhering to my doctrine? But you have always been prone to being
led away, and have followed in turn every one you meet." And, so saying,
he told this story of the past.

Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, he Bodhisatta
became his minister. In those days the king had a state elephant
\[187\], named Damsel-face, who was virtuous and good, and never hurt
anybody.

Now one day some burglars came close up to the elephant's stall by night
and sat down to discuss their plans in these words:--"This is the way to
tunnel into a house; this is the way to break in through the walls;
before carrying off the plunder, the tunnel or breach in the walls ought
to be made as clear and open as a road or a ford. In lifting the goods,
you shouldn't stick at murder; for thus there will be none able to
resist. A burglar should get rid of all goodness and virtue, and be
quite pitiless, a man of cruelty and violence." After having schooled
one another in these counsels, the burglars took themselves off. The
next day too they came, and many other days besides, and held like
converse together, till the elephant came to the conclusion that they
came expressly to instruct him, and that he must turn pitiless, cruel,
and violent. And such indeed he became. No sooner did his mahout appear
in the early morning than the elephant took the man in his trunk and
dashed him to death on the ground. And in the same way he treated a
second, and a third, and every person in turn who came near him.

The news was brought to the king that Damsel-face had gone mad and was
killing everybody that he caught sight of. So the king sent the
Bodhisatta, saying, "Go, sage, and find out what has perverted him."

Away went the Bodhisatta, and soon satisfied himself that the elephant
showed no signs of bodily ailment. As he thought over the possible
causes of the change, he came to the conclusion that the elephant must
have heard persons talking near him, and have imagined that they were
giving him a lesson, and that this was what had perverted the animal.
Accordingly, he asked the elephant-keepers whether any persons had been
talking together recently near the stall by night. "Yes, my lord," was
the answer; "some burglars came and talked." Then the Bodhisatta went
and told the king, saying, "There is nothing wrong, sire, with the
elephant bodily; he has been perverted by overhearing some burglars
talk." "Well, what is to be done now?" "Order good men, sages and
brahmins, to sit in his stall and to talk of goodness." "Do so, my
friend," said the king. Then the Bodhisatta set good men, sages and
brahmins, in the stall \[188\], and bade them talk of goodness. And
they, taking their seats hard by the elephant, spoke as follows,
"Neither maltreat nor kill. The good should be long-suffering, loving,
and merciful." Hearing this the elephant thought they must mean this as
a lesson for him, and resolved thenceforth to become good. And good he
became.

"Well, my friend," said the king to the Bodhisatta; "is he good now?"
"Yes, your majesty," said the Bodhisatta; "thanks to wise and

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

(food men the elephant who was so perverted has become himself again."
And so saying, he repeated this stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Through hearing first the burglars' wicked talk  
Damsel-face ranged abroad to wound and kill;  
Through hearing, later, wise men's lofty words  
The noble elephant turned good once more.

</div>

Said the king, "He can read the mind even of an animal!" And he
conferred great honour on the Bodhisatta. After living to a good old
age, he, with the Bodhisatta, passed away to fare according to his
deserts.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Said the Master,--"In the past, too, you followed everyone you met,
Brother; hearing burglars talk, you followed what they said; and hearing
the wise and good talk, you followed what they said." His lesson ended,
he shewed the connexion, and identified the Birth, by saying, "The
traitorous Brother was the Damsel-face of those days, Ānanda the king,
and I myself the minister."
