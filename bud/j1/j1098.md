### MAHĀSUDASSANA-JĀTAKA.

"*How transient*."--This story was told by the Master as he lay on his
death-bed, concerning Ānanda's words, "O Blessed One, suffer not your
end to be in this sorry little town."

"When the Buddha was dwelling at Jetavana," thought the Master, "the
Elder Sāriputta <span id="fr_156"></span>[1](#fn_155), who was born in
Nāla village, died at Varaka in the month of Kattika, when the moon was
at the full; and in the selfsame month, when the

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

moon was on the wane, the great Moggallāna died <span
id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_156). My two chief disciples being dead, I
too will pass away, in Kusinārā."--So thought the Blessed One; and
coming in his alms-pilgrimage to Kusinārā, there upon the Northward
bench between the twin Sāl-trees he lay down never to rise again. Then
said the Elder Ānanda, "O Blessed One, suffer not your end to be in this
sorry little town, this rough little town in the jungle, this little
suburban town. Shall not Rājagaha or some other large city be the
death-place of the Buddha?"

"Nay, Ānanda," said the Master; "call not this a sorry little town, a
little town in the jungle, a little suburban town. In bygone days, in
the days of Sudassana's universal monarchy, it was in this town that I
had my dwelling. It was then a mighty city encompassed by jewelled walls
\[392\] twelve leagues round." Therewithal, at the Elder's request, he
told this story of the past and uttered the Mahā-Sudassana Sutta <span
id="fr_158"></span>[2](#fn_157).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Then it was that Sudassana's queen Subhaddā marked how, after coming
down from the Palace of Truth, her lord was lying hard by on his right
side on the couch prepared for him in the Palm-grove <span
id="fr_159"></span>[3](#fn_158) which was all of gold and jewels,--that
couch from which he was not to rise again. And she said, "Eighty-four
thousand cities, chief of which is the royal-city of Kusāvatī, own your
sovereignty, sire. Set your heart on them."

"Say not so, my queen," said Sudassana; "rather exhort me, saying, 'Keep
your heart set on this town, and yearn not after those others'."

"Why so, my lord?"

"Because I shall die to-day," answered the king.

In tears, wiping her streaming eyes, the queen managed to sob out the
words the king bade her say. Then she broke into weeping and
lamentation; and the other women of the harem, to the number of
eighty-four thousand, also wept and wailed; nor could any of the
courtiers forbear, but all alike joined in one universal lament.

"Peace!" said the Bodhisatta; and at his word their lamentation was
stilled. Then, turning to the queen, he said,--"Weep not, my queen, nor
wail. For, even down to a tiny seed of sesamum, there is no such thing
as a compound thing which is permanent; all are transient, all must
break up." Then, for the queen's behoof, he uttered this stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

How transient are all component things!  
Growth is their nature and decay:  
They are produced, they are dissolved again:  
And then is best,--when they have sunk to rest <span
id="fr_160"></span>[4](#fn_159).

</div>

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

\[393\] Thus did the great Sudassana lead his discourse up to ambrosial
Nirvana as its goal. Moreover, to the rest of the multitude he gave the
exhortation to be charitable, to obey the Commandments, and to keep
hallowed the fast days. The destiny be won was to be re-born thereafter
in the Realm of Devas.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

His lesson ended, the Master identified the Birth by saying, "The mother
of Rāhula <span id="fr_161"></span>[1](j1099.htm#fn_160) was the Queen
Subhaddā of those days; Rāhula was the King's eldest son; the disciples
of the Buddha were his courtiers; and I myself the great Sudassana."
