#### SŪCI-JĀTAKA.

*"Quickly threaded," etc.*—The Master told this tale while dwelling in
Jetavana, concerning the perfection of wisdom. The occasion of the tale
will be given in the Mahāummagga <span id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_110.md).
The Master addressed the brethren, "This is not the first time the
Tathāgata is wise and skilled in devices," and so he told an old tale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta
was born in the kingdom of Kāsi in a smith's family, and when he grew up
he became excellent in the craft. His parents were poor. Not far from
their village was another smith's village of a thousand houses. The
principal smith of the thousand was a favourite of the king, rich and of
great substance. His daughter was exceedingly beautiful, like to a nymph
of heaven, with all the auspicious marks of a lady of the land. People
came from the villages round to have razors, axes, ploughshares and
goads made, and generally saw that maiden. When they went back to their
own villages, they praised her beauty \[282\] in the places where men
sit and elsewhere. The Bodhisatta, being attracted by merely hearing of
her, thought, "I will make her my wife": so he took iron of the best
kind, and made one delicate strong needle which pierced dice and floated
on water: then he made a sheath for it of the same kind and pierced dice
with it: and in the same way he made seven sheaths: how he made them is
not to be told, for such work prospers through the greatness of
Bodhisattas' knowledge. Then he put the needle in a tube and placing it
in a case he went to that village and asked for the street where the
head-smith's house was: then standing at the door he said, "Who will buy
for money from my hand a needle of this kind?" describing the needle,
and so standing by the head-smith's house he spoke the first stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Quickly threaded, smooth and straight,  
    Polished with emery,  
Sharp of point and delicate,  
    Needles! who will buy?

</div>

After this he praised it again and spoke the second stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Quickly threaded, strong and straight,  
    Rounded properly,  
Iron they will penetrate,  
    Needles! who will buy?

</div>

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

\[283\] At that moment the maiden was fanning her father with a
palm-leaf as he lay on a little bed to allay discomfort after his early
meal, and hearing the Bodhisatta's sweet voice, as if she had been
sickened by a fresh lump of meat, and had the discomfort extinguished by
a thousand pots of water, she said, "Who is this hawking needles with
sweet voice in a village of smiths? For what business has he come? I
will find out": so laying down the palm-fan she went out and spoke with
him outside, standing in the verandah. The purpose of Bodhisattas
prospers: it was for her sake he had come to that village. She speaking
with him said, "Young man, dwellers in all the kingdom come to this
village for needles and the like: it is in folly you wish to sell
needles in a village of smiths; though you declare the praise of your
needle all day no one will take it from your hand; if you wish to get a
price, go to another village": so she spoke two stanzas:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Our hooks are sold, both up and down,  
    Men know our needles well:  
We all are smiths in this good town:  
    Needles! who can sell?

In iron-work we have renown,  
    In weapons we excel:  
We all are smiths in this good town:  
    Needles! who can sell?

</div>

The Bodhisatta hearing her words said, "Lady, you say this not knowing
and in ignorance ": and so he spoke two stanzas:—

\[284\] <span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Though all are smiths in this good town,  
    Yet skill can needles sell;  
For masters in the craft will own  
    A first-rate article.

Lady, if once your father know  
    This needle made by me;  
On me your hand he would bestow  
    And all his property.

</div>

The head-smith hearing all their talk called his daughter and asked,
"Who is that you are talking to?" "Father, a man selling needles." "Then
call him here." She went and called him. The Bodhisatta saluted the
head-smith and stood by. The head-smith asked, "Of what village are
you?" "I am of such a village and son of such a smith." "Why are you
come here?" "To sell needles." "Come, let us see your needle." \[285\]
The Bodhisatta, wishing to declare his qualities among them all, said,
"Is not a thing seen in the midst of all better than one seen by each
singly?" "Quite right, friend." So he gathered all the smiths together
and in their midst said, "Sir, take the needle." "Master, have an anvil
brought and a bronze dish full of water." This was done. The Bodhisatta
took the needle-tube from the wrapper and gave it to

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

them. The head-smith taking it asked, "Is this the needle?" "No, it is
not the needle, it is the sheath." He examining could not see end nor
tip. The Bodhisatta, taking it from them, drew off the sheath with his
nail and showing it to the people with "This is the needle, this is the
sheath," he put the needle in the master's hand and the sheath at his
feet. Again when the master said, "This is the needle, I suppose," he
answered, "This too is a needle-sheath": then he struck it off with his
nail, and so he laid six sheaths in succession at the head-smith's feet
and saying, "Here is the needle," laid it on his hand. The thousand
smiths snapped their fingers in delight, and the waving of cloths began;
then the head-smith asked, "Friend, what is the strength of this
needle?" "Master, have this anvil raised up by a strong man and a
water-vessel set under the anvil: then strike the needle straight into
the anvil." He had this done and struck the needle by the point into the
anvil. The needle <span id="fr_113"></span>[1](j3089.htm#fn_111.md)
piercing the anvil lay across on the surface of the water not moving a
hair's breadth up or down. All the smiths said, "We have never heard all
this time even by rumour that there are such smiths as this:" so they
snapped their fingers and waved a thousand cloths. \[286\] The
head-smith called his daughter and in the midst of the assembly saying,
"This maiden is a suitable match for you," he poured water on <span
id="fr_114"></span>[2](j3089.htm#fn_112.md) them and gave her away. And
afterwards when the head-smith died the Bodhisatta became head-smith in
the village.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the lesson, the Master declared the Truths and identified the
Birth: "The smith's daughter was Rāhula's mother, the clever young smith
was myself."
