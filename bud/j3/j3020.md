\[64\] *"Happy life," etc.*—This was a story told by the Master while
living in the Badarika Monastery near Kosambī, regarding the elder
Rāhula. The introductory story has been already related in full in the
Tipallattha Birth. <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md) Now when the
Brethren in the Hall of Truth were setting forth the praises of the
venerable Rāhula, and speaking of him as fond of instruction, scrupulous
and patient of rebuke, the Master came up and on hearing from them the
subject of their discourse said, "Not now only, but formerly also Rāhula
possessed all these virtues." And then he told them a legend of the
past.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family. And when he grew up, he studied
all the arts at Takkasilā, and giving up the world devoted himself to
the ascetic life in the Himalāya country, and developed all the
Faculties and Attainments. There enjoying the pleasures of ecstatic
meditation he dwelt in a pleasant grove, whence he journeyed to a
frontier village to procure salt and vinegar. The people, on seeing him,
became believers, and built him a hut of leaves in a wood, and providing
him with all that a Buddhist requires, made a home for him there.

At this time a fowler in this village had caught a decoy partridge, and
putting it in a cage carefully trained and looked after it. Then he took
it to the wood, and by its cry decoyed all the other partridges that
came near. The partridge thought: "Through me many of my kinsfolk come
by their death. This is a wicked act on my part." So it kept quiet. When
its master found it was quiet, he struck it on the head with a piece of
bamboo. The partridge from the pain it suffered uttered a cry. And the
fowler gained a living by decoying other partridges through it. Then the
partridge thought: "Well, suppose they die. There is no evil intention
on my part. Do the evil consequences of my action affect me? When I am
quiet, they do not come, but when I utter a cry, they do. And all that
come this fellow catches and puts to death. Is there any sinful act here
on my part, or is there not?" Thenceforth the only thought of the
partridge is, "Who verily may resolve my doubt?" \[65\] and it goes
about seeking for such a wise man. Now one day the fowler snared a lot
of partridges, and filling his basket with them he came to the
Bodhisatta's hermitage to beg a draught of water. And putting down the
cage near the Bodhisatta, he drank some water and lay down on the sand
and fell

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

asleep. The partridge observing that he was asleep thought, "I will ask
this ascetic as to my doubt, and if he knows he will solve my
difficulty." And as it lay in its cage, it repeated the first stanza in
the form of a question:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Happy life I lead all day,  
    Food abundant falls to me:  
Yet I'm in a parlous way,  
    What's my future state to be?

</div>

The Bodhisatta solving this question uttered the second stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

If no evil in thy heart  
    Prompts to deed of villainy,  
Shouldst thou play a passive part,  
    Guilt attaches not to thee.

</div>

The partridge on hearing this uttered the third stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Lo! our kinsman": thus they cry,  
    And in crowds they flock to see.  
Am I guilty, should they die?  
    Please resolve this doubt for me.

</div>

\[66\] On hearing this, the Bodhisatta repeated the fourth stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

If no sin lurks in the heart,  
    Innocent the deed will be.  
He who plays a passive part  
    From all guilt is counted free.

</div>

Thus did the Great Being console the partridge. And through him the bird
was freed from remorse. Then the fowler waking up saluted the Bodhisatta
and took up his cage and made off.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Master, having ended his lesson, identified the Birth: "At that time
Rāhula was the partridge, and I myself was the ascetic."
