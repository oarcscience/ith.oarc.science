*"Oil and butter," etc.*—The Master told this while dwelling in
Jetavana, concerning a greedy Brother. Finding that he was greedy the
Master said to him, "This is not the first time you are greedy: once
before through greed in Benares you were not satisfied with carcases of
elephants, oxen, horses and men; and in hopes of getting better food you
went to the forest;" and so he told an old tale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta was born as a quail and lived in the forest on rude grass and
seeds. At the time there was in Benares a greedy crow who, not content
with carcases of elephants and other animals, went to the forest in
hopes of better food: eating wild fruits there he saw the Bodhisatta and
thinking "This quail is very fat: I fancy he eats sweet food, I will ask

him of his food and eating it become fat myself," he perched on a bough
above the Bodhisatta. The Bodhisatta \[313\], without being asked, gave
him greeting and spoke the first stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Oil and butter are your victuals, nuncle; rich your food, I trow:  
Tell me then what is the reason of your leanness, master crow.

</div>

Hearing his words the crow spoke three stanzas:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I dwell in midst of many foes, my heart goes pit-a-pat  
In terror as I seek my food: how can a crow be fat?

Crows spend their lives in fear, their wits for mischief ever keen;  
The bits they pick are not enough; good quail, that's why I'm lean.

Rude grass and seeds are all your food: there's little richness there:  
Then tell me why you're fat, good quail, on such a scanty fare.

</div>

The Bodhisatta hearing him spoke these stanzas, explaining the reason of
his fatness:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I have content and easy mind, short distances to go,  
I live on anything I get, and so I'm fat, good crow.

Content of mind, and happiness with little care of heart,  
A standard easily attained: that life's the better part.

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\[314\] After the lesson, the Master declared the Truths, and identified
the Birth:—At the end of the Truths the Brother was established in the
fruition of the First Path: "At that time the crow was the greedy
Brother, the quail was myself."
