#### GHATA-JĀTAKA.

*"While others weep," etc.*—This story the Master, dwelling at Jetavana,
told concerning a minister of the king of Kosala. The introductory story
is identical with one already given. But in this case the king after
bestowing great honour on a minister who served him well, gave ear to
certain mischief-makers and had him seized and thrown into prison. While
he was lying there, he entered upon the First Path. The king, becoming
aware of his great merit, released him. He took a scented garland and
coming into the presence of the Master, saluted him and sat down. Then
the Master asked if some evil had not befallen him. "Yes, Reverend Sir,"
he answered, "but through evil good has come to me. I have entered on
the First Path." "Verily," said the Master, "not you only, but sages of
old got good out of evil." And herewith at his request he told a story
of the past.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta was born to him as the son of his queen-consort. And they
called him prince Ghata. He afterwards acquired a knowledge of the arts
at Takkasilā and ruled his kingdom righteously.

Now a certain minister misconducted himself in the royal harem. The
king, after witnessing the offence with his own eyes, banished him from

his kingdom. At that time a king named Vaṅka ruled in Sāvatthi. The
minister went to him and entering his service, just as in the former
story <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65.md), gained the king's ear and got
him to seize on the kingdom of Benares. After gaining possession of the
kingdom, he had the Bodhisatta bound in chains and threw him into
prison. The Bodhisatta entered on an ecstatic meditation \[169\] and sat
cross-legged in the air. A burning heat sprang up in the body of Vaṅka.
He came and beheld the countenance of the Bodhisatta radiant with the
beauty of a full-blown lotus, like to a golden mirror, and in the form
of a question repeated the first stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

While others weep and wail, their cheeks with tears bestained,  
Why still with smiling face, has Ghata ne’er complained?

</div>

Then the Bodhisatta, to explain why he did not grieve, recited the
remaining stanzas:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

To change the past all sorrow is but vain,  
    It has no blessing for a future state:  
Why should I, Vaṅka, of my woes complain?  
    Grief is no helpmeet fit with us to mate.

One that is sick with sorrow pines away,  
    His food insipid and distasteful grows,  
Pierced as with arrows, to his grief a prey,  
    He sinks a laughing-stock to all his foes.

Whether my home be on dry land or sea,  
    Be it in village, or some forest drear,  
No sorrow ever shall come nigh to me,  
    A soul converted can have nought to fear.

But he that lacks completion in himself  
    And is with lust of things of sense a-fire,  
Not the whole world, with all its sordid pelf,  
    Can e’er suffice for such a man's desire.

</div>

\[170\] Vaṅka therefore, after hearing these four stanzas, asked
forgiveness of the Bodhisatta, and restored him to his kingdom and went
his way. But the Bodhisatta handed over the kingdom to his ministers,
and retreating to the Himālayas became an ascetic, and without any break
in his ecstatic meditation was destined to birth in the world of Brahma.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Master, having ended his lesson, identified the Birth: "At that time
Ananda was king Vaṅka, and I myself was king Ghata."
