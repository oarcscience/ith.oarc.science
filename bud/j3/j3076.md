*"I feel quite well," etc.*—This story the Master, whilst dwelling at
Jetavana, told concerning a greedy Brother. This story of the greedy
Brother has already been fully told in divers ways. In this case the
Master asked him if he were greedy and on his confessing that it was so,
said, "Not now only, but formerly also, Brother, you were greedy, and
through greed came by your death." And herewith he told a story of the
past.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\[225\] Once upon a time in the reign of Brahmadatta, king of Benares,
the Bodhisatta came to life as a young pigeon and lived in a wicker
cage, in the kitchen of a rich merchant of Benares. Now a crow hankering
after fish and flesh made friends with this pigeon, and lived in the
same place. One day he caught sight of a lot of fish and meat and
thought, "I'll have this to eat," and lay loudly groaning in the cage.
And when the pigeon said, "Come, my friend, let us sally out for our
food," he refused to go, saying, "I am laid up with a fit of
indigestion. Do you go." And when the pigeon was gone, he said, "My
troublesome enemy is off.

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I will now eat
fish and meat to my heart's content." And so thinking, he repeated the
first stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I feel quite well and at my ease,  
    Since Mr. Pigeon off is gone.  
My cravings I will now appease:  
    Potherbs and meat should strengthen one.

</div>

So when the cook who was roasting the fish and meat came out of the
kitchen, wiping away streams of sweat from his person, the crow hopped
out of his basket and bid himself in a basin of spices. The basin gave
forth a "click" sound, and the cook came in haste, and seizing the crow
pulled out his feathers. And grinding some moist ginger and white
mustard he pounded it with a rotten date, and smeared him all over with
it, and rubbing it on with a potsherd \[226\] he wounded the bird. Then
he fastened the potsherd on his neck with a string, and threw him back
into the basket, and went off.

When the pigeon came back and saw him he said, "Who is this crane lying
in my friend's basket? He is a hot-tempered fellow and will come and
kill this stranger." And thus jesting, he spoke the second stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Child of the Clouds," <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_91.md) with tufted
crest,  
Why didst thou steal my poor friend's nest?  
Come here, Sir Crane. My friend the crow  
Has a hot temper, you must know.

</div>

The crow, on hearing this, uttered the third stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Well mayst thou laugh at such a sight,  
For I am in a sorry plight.  
The cook has plucked and basted me  
With rotten dates and spicery.

</div>

The pigeon, still making sport of him, repeated the fourth stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Bathed and anointed well, I think,  
Thou hast thy fill of food and drink.  
Thy neck so bright with jewel sheen,  
Hast thou, friend, to Benares been?

</div>

Then the crow repeated the fifth stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Let not my friend or bitterest foe  
On visit to Benares go.  
They plucked me bare and as a jest  
Have tied a potsherd on my breast.

</div>

\[227\] The pigeon hearing this repeated the final stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

These evil habits to outgrow  
Is hard with such a nature, crow.  
Birds should be careful to avoid  
The food they see by man enjoyed.

</div>

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

After thus reproving him, the pigeon no longer dwelt there, but spread
his wings and flew elsewhere. But the crow died then and there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Master here ended his lesson and revealed the Truths and identified
the Birth:—At the conclusion of the Truths the greedy Brother attained
fruition of the Second Path:—"At that time the crow was the greedy
Brother, the pigeon was myself."
