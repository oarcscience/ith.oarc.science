*"Why in mid air," etc.*—This story the Master, while dwelling at
Jetavana, told concerning the duty of doing good to men. The incident
that led to the story will be set forth in the Mahākaṇha Birth. <span

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta came to life as the son of his chief queen. And when he was
of age, he was instructed in all the arts and on the death of his father
was established in his kingdom and governed it righteously.

At that time men were devoted to the worship of the gods \[146\] and
made religious offerings to them by the slaughter of many goats, rams
and the like. The Bodhisatta proclaimed by beat of drum, "No living
creature is to be put to death." The Yakkhas were enraged against the
Bodhisatta at losing their offerings, and calling together an assembly
of their kind in the Himalayās, they sent forth a certain savage Yakkha
to slay the Bodhisatta. He took a huge blazing mass of iron as big as
the dome of a

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

house, and thinking to strike a deadly blow, immediately after the mid
watch, came and stood at the bed's head of the Bodhisatta. At that
instant the throne of Sakka manifested signs of heat. After considering
the matter the god discovered the cause, and grasping his thunderbolt in
his hand he came and stood over the Yakkha. The Bodhisatta on seeing the
Yakkha thought, "Why in the world is he standing here? Is it to protect
me, or from a desire to slay me?" And as he talked with him he repeated
the first stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Why in mid air, O Yakkha, dost thou stand  
With yon huge bolt of iron in thy hand?  
Art thou to guard me from all harm intent,  
Or here to-day for my destruction sent?

</div>

Now the Bodhisatta saw only the Yakkha. He did not see Sakka. The Yakkha
through fear of Sakka durst not strike the Bodhisatta. On hearing the
words of the Bodhisatta the Yakkha said, "Great king, I am not stationed
here to guard you; I came minded to smite you with this blazing mass of
iron, but through fear of Sakka I dare not strike you." And to explain
his meaning he uttered the second stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

As messenger of Rakkhasas, lo! here  
To compass thy destruction I appear,  
But all in vain the fiery bolt I wield  
Against the head that Indra's self would shield.

</div>

On hearing this the Bodhisatta repeated two more stanzas:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

If Indra, Sujā's lord, in heaven that reigns,  
Great king of gods, my cause to champion deigns,  
\[147\] With hideous howl though goblins rend the sky,  
No demon brood has power to terrify.  
Let mud-sprite devils gibber as they may,  
They are not equal to so stern a fray.

</div>

Thus did Sakka put the Yakkha to flight. And exhorting the Great Being,
he said, "Great king, fear not. Henceforth we will protect you. Be not
afraid." And so saying he returned straight to his own place of abode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Master here ended his lesson and identified the Birth: "At that time
Anuruddha was Sakka, and I myself was the king of Benares."
