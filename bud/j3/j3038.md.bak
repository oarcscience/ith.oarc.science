*"Alas! we offered thee," etc.*—This story the Master told while living
at Jetavana, about a certain Brother. He came, it was said, from the
country to Jetavana, and, after putting away his bowl and robe, he
saluted the Master and inquired of the young novices, saying, "Sirs, who
look after the stranger Brethren that come to Sāvatthi?" \[119\] "The
Treasurer Anāthapiṇḍika," they said, "and the great and holy lay sister
Visākhā look after the order of the Brethren, and stand in the place of
father and mother to them." "Very good,"

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

he said, and next day quite early, before a single brother had entered
the house, he came to Anāthapiṇḍika's door. From his having come at an
unseasonable hour there was no one to attend to him. Without getting
anything there he went off to the door of Visākhā's house. There also
from having come too early, he got nothing. After wandering hither and
thither he came back, and finding the rice-gruel was all finished, he
went off. Again he wandered about hither and thither, and on his return,
finding the rice all finished, he went back to the monastery, and said,
"The brethren here speak of these two families as faithful believers,
but both of them really are without faith and unbelievers." Thus did he
go about abusing these families. So one day they started a discussion in
the Hall of Truth, how that a certain Brother from the country came to
the door of certain households too early, and failing to obtain alms
went about reviling those families. When the Master came and inquired
what was the topic the Brethren were sitting to discuss, on hearing what
it was, he called the Brother and asked him if it were true. When the
Brother said, "Yes, your Reverence, it is true," the Master asked, "Why
are you angry, Brother? Of old, before Buddha arose upon the world, even
ascetics when they visited a household and received no alms, showed no
anger." And with this he told a story of the olden days.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family, and when he was of age he
studied all the arts at Takkasilā, and subsequently adopted the
religious life of an ascetic. After sojourning a long time in the
Himālayas he went to Benares to procure salt and vinegar, and, taking up
his abode in a garden, on the next day he entered the city for alms.
There was at this time a merchant at Benares, who was a faithful
believer. The Bodhisatta asked which was a believing household, and on
hearing of the merchant's family, he went to the door of his house. At
that moment the merchant had gone to pay his respects to the king, and
neither did any of his people happen to see him. So he turned back and
came away.

Then the merchant who was returning from the palace saw him, \[120\] and
saluting him took his alms-bowl and led him to his house. There he
offered him a seat and comforted him with the washing and anointing of
his feet, and with rice, cakes and other food, and in the course of his
meal he asked him one thing and another, and after he had finished
eating, he saluted him and sitting respectfully on one side, he said,
"Reverend Sir, strangers who have come to our doors, whether beggars or
holy priests or brahmins, have never before gone away without receiving
marks of honour and respect, but to-day owing to your not being seen by
our retainers, you have gone away without being offered a seat, or water
to drink, and without having your feet washed, or rice and gruel given
you to eat. This is our fault. You must forgive us in this." And with
these words he uttered the first stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

    Alas! we offered thee no seat,  
No water brought, nor anything to eat:  
    We here confess our sinfulness,  
And pardon humbly, Holy Sir, entreat.

</div>

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

The Bodhisatta on hearing this repeated the second stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Nought have I to condone,  
    No anger do I feel,  
The thought just once I own  
    Across my mind did steal,  
"Habits of people here  
Are just a trifle queer."

</div>

The merchant hearing this responded in two more stanzas:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The custom of our family—’twas so  
Received by us from ages long ago—  
Is to provide the stranger with a seat,  
Supply his needs, bring water for his feet  
And every guest as kinsman dear to treat.

</div>

\[121\] And the Bodhisatta, after sojourning there a few days, and
teaching the merchant of Benares his duty, went straight back to the
Himālayas, where he developed all the Faculties and Attainments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Master, having ended his lesson, revealed the Truths and identified
the Birth:— At the conclusion of the Truths the Brother attained
fruition of the First Path:— "At that time Ānanda was the merchant of
Benares, and I myself was the ascetic."
