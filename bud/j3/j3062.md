\[191\] *"Is it thus, Sudātha," etc.*—This story the Master, while
dwelling at Jetavana, told concerning the two chief disciples. On a
certain occasion the two chief elders resolved during the rainy season
to devote themselves to solitude. So they bade the Master farewell and
leaving the company of the Brethren they went forth from Jetavana,
carrying their bowl and robes with their own hands, and lived in a
forest near a border village. And a certain man, who waited on the
elders and lived upon their broken victuals, dwelt apart in the same
place. On seeing how happily these elders lived together, he thought: "I
wonder if it is possible to set them at variance." So he drew nigh to
Sāriputta and said, "Can it be, Reverend Sir, that there is some quarrel
between you and the venerable chief elder Moggallāna?" "Why so, Sir?" he
asked. "He ever, Holy Sir, speaks in your dispraise and says, "When I am
gone, what is Sāriputta worth compared with me in caste, lineage, family
and country, or in the power of attainments in the sacred volumes?" The
elder smiled and said, "Be off, sirrah!" Another day he drew nigh to the
chief elder Moggallāna, and said the same thing. He too smiled and said,
"Be off, sirrah!" Moggallāna went to Sāriputta and asked, "Has this
fellow, who lives on our leavings, said aught to you?" "Yes, friend, he
has." "And he said exactly the same thing to me. We must drive him
away." "Very well, friend, drive him away." The elder said, "You are not
to come here," and snapping his fingers at him, he drove him away. The
two elders lived happily together, and returning to the Master, made
obeisance to him and sat down. The Master spoke kindly to them and asked
if they had kept their Retreat pleasantly. They said, "A certain beggar
wished to set us at variance, but failing in the attempt he ran away."
The Master said, "Verily, Sāriputta, not now only, but formerly also, he
thought to set you at variance, but failing in the attempt he ran away."
And hereupon at his request he related a story of bygone days.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta was a tree-god in a forest. \[192\] At that time a lion and a
tiger lived in a mountain-cave in that forest. A jackal was in
attendance on them, and living on their broken meats began to wax gross
of body. And one day he was struck with the thought, "I have never yet
eaten the flesh of a lion or a tiger. I must set these two animals by
the ears, and when in consequence of their quarrel they have come by
their death, I will eat their flesh." So he drew nigh to the lion and
said, "Is there any quarrel, Sir, between you and the tiger?" "Why so,
Sir?" "Your Reverence," he said, "he ever speaks in your dispraise and
says, "When I

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

am gone, this lion will never attain to the sixteenth part of my
personal beauty, nor of my stature and girth, nor of my natural strength
and power." Then the lion said to him, "Off with you. He will never
speak thus of me." Then the jackal drew nigh to the tiger also, and
spoke after the same manner. On hearing him, the tiger hastened to the
lion, and asked, "Friend, is it true, that you said so and so of me?"
And he spoke the first stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Is it thus  <span id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_74)Sudāṭha speaks of me?  
"In grace of form and pedigree,  
In might and prowess in the field,  
 <span id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_74)Subāhu still to me must yield."

</div>

On hearing this Sudāṭha repeated the four remaining stanzas:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Is it thus Subāhu speaks of me?  
"In grace of form and pedigree,  
In might and prowess in the field, Sudāṭha still to me must yield."  
If such injurious words are thine,  
No more shalt thou be friend of mine.  
The man that lends a ready ear  
To any gossip he may hear,  
Soon picks a quarrel with a friend,  
And love in bitter hate will end.  
No friend suspects without a cause,  
Or carefully looks out for flaws;  
\[193\] But on his friend in trust will rest  
As child upon its mother's breast,  
And ne’er will by a stranger's word  
Be parted from his bosom's lord.

</div>

When the qualities of a friend had been thus set forth in these four
stanzas, the tiger said, "The fault is mine," and begged pardon of the
lion. And they continued to live happily together in the same place. But
the jackal departed and fled elsewhere.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Master, having brought his lesson to an end, identified the
Birth:"At that time the jackal was the beggar who lived on broken meats,
the lion was Sāriputta, the tiger Moggallāna, and the deity that dwelt
in that forest and saw the whole thing with his own eyes was I myself."
