*"Lo! countless trees," etc.*—This story the Master dwelling at Jetavana
told concerning the Verañjā section <span
id="fr_182"></span>[1](#fn_179). When the Master after passing the rainy
season at Verañjā in due course arrived at Sāvatthi, the Brethren in the
Hall of Truth raised a discussion saying, "Sirs, a Tathāgata, a
delicately nurtured kshatriya and Buddha, though possessed of
supernatural powers, at the invitation of a brahmin of Verañjā stayed
three ṃonths with him, and when owing to the temptation of Māra he
failed to receive an alms at the hands of the brahmin, even for a single
day, he gave up all covetous ways, and keeping in the same place for
three months lived on water and a modicum of the ground flour of roots.
\[4951 Oh the contented nature of Tathāgatas!" When the Master came and
on inquiry learned the nature of their discussion he said, "It is no
marvel, Brethren, that a Tathāgata now has lost all covetousness, seeing
that formerly when born in an animal form he forsook covetousness." And
hereupon he told a story of the past. The whole story is now to be
related in detail in exactly the same way as in the preceding tale.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Lo! countless trees are here, all green and fruitful see!  
Why, parrot, dost thou cling to this poor withered tree?

Long years we have enjoyed the luscious fruit it bare,  
And tho’ it now has none, it still should claim our care.

Nor leaves nor fruit it yields, alas! the tree is dead:  
Why blame thy fellow-birds, that they should all have fled?

They loved it for its fruit, and now that it has none,  
Poor selfish fools! their love and gratitude is gone.

Thy gratitude I own, thy true and constant love,  
Sure virtue such as this the wise will aye approve.

I offer thee, O bird, whate’er thou wilt for choice;  
Tell me, I pray, what boon would most thy heart rejoice?

Would that this tree alight bear fresh leaves and fruit again;  
I would be glad as they that treasure trove obtain.

Then was the tree by Sakka with ambrosia sprinkled o’er,  
And boughs sprang up with cooling shade, as lovely as before.

May Sakka and all loved by Sakka blesséd be,  
As I to-day am blest this joyous sight to see.

Thus was the tree made fruitful by the parrot's grateful choice,  
And Sakka and his queen in groves of Nandana rejoice.

\[496\] The Master, his lesson ended, identified the Birth: "In those
days Sakka was Anuruddha, the parrot king was myself."
