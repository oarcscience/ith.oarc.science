*"Nought in common," etc.*—This story the Master, dwelling at Jetavana,
told concerning the moral precept on slander.

Once upon a time the Master hearing that the Six <span
id="fr_61"></span>[2](#fn_61) Priests collect slanderous tales, called
them to him and asked, "Is it true, Brothers, that you collect
slanderous tales of such of your brethren as are inclined to quarrelling
and strife and disputation, and that quarrels therefore, that would not
otherwise arise, spring up and when they so arise have a tendency to
grow?" "It is true," they said. Then he reproved those brethren and
said, "Brothers, backbiting speech is like to a blow with a sharp sword.
A firm friendship is quickly broken up by slander and people that listen
thereto become liable to be estranged from their friends, as was the
case with the lion and the bull." And so saying he told an old legend of
the past.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta was born as his son, and after acquiring all the arts at
Takkasilā, on his father's death, he ruled his kingdom righteously.

At that time a certain neatherd, who was tending cattle in their sheds
in the forest, came home and inadvertently left behind him a cow that
was in calf. Between this cow and a lioness sprang up a firm friendship.
The

two animals became fast friends and went about together. So after a time
the cow brought forth a calf and the lioness a cub. These two young
creatures also by the force of family ties became fast friends and
wandered about together. \[150\] Then a certain forester, after
observing their affection, took such wares as are produced in the forest
and went to Benares and presented them to the King. And when the king
asked him, "Friend, have you seen any unusual marvel in the forest?" he
made answer, "I saw nothing else that was wonderful, my lord, but I did
see a lion and a bull wandering about together, very friendly one
towards another."

"Should a third animal appear," said the king, "there will certainly be
mischief. Come and tell me, if you see the pair joined by a third
animal."

"Certainly, my lord," he answered.

Now when the forester had left for Benares, a jackal ministered to the
lion and the bull. When he returned to the forest and saw this he said,
"I will tell the king that a third animal has appeared," and departed
for the city. Now the jackal thought, "There is no meat that I have not
eaten except the flesh of lions and bulls. By setting these two at
variance, I will get their flesh to eat." And he said, "This is the way
he speaks of you," and thus dividing them one from another, he soon
brought about a quarrel and reduced them to a dying condition.

But the forester came and told the king, "My lord, a third animal has
turned up;" "What is it?" said the king. "A jackal, my lord." Said the
king, "He will cause them to quarrel, and will bring about their death.
We shall find them dead when we arrive." And so saying, he mounted upon
his chariot and travelling on the road pointed out by the forester, he
arrived just as the two animals had by their quarrel destroyed one
another. The jackal highly delighted was eating, now the flesh of the
lion, and now that of the bull. The king when he saw that they were both
dead, stood just as he was upon his chariot, and addressing his
charioteer gave utterance to these verses:

\[151\] <span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Nought in common had this pair,  
Neither wives nor food did share;  
Yet behold how slanderous word,  
Keen as any two-edged sword,  
Did devise with cunning art  
Friends of old to keep apart.  
Thus did bull and lion fall  
Prey to meanest beast of all:  
So will all bed-fellows be  
With this pair in misery,  
If they lend a willing ear  
To the slanderer's whispered sneer.  
But they thrive exceeding well,  
E’en as those in heaven that dwell,  
Who to slander ne’er attend—  
Slander parting friend from friend.

\[152\] The king spoke these verses, and bidding them gather together
the mane, skin, claws, and teeth of the lion, returned straight to his
own city.

The Master, having ended his lesson, thus identified the Birth: "At that
time I myself was the king."
