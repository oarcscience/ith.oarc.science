#### SUMAṄGALA-JĀTAKA.

*"Conscious of an angry frown," etc.*—The Master told this tale while
dwelling at Jetavana, concerning the admonition of a king. On this
occasion the Master, at the king's request, told the tale of old.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta
was born as the son of his chief queen. When he grew up, he became king
on his father's death and gave abundant alms. He had a park-keeper named
Sumaṅgala. A certain paccekabuddha left the Nandamūla cave on a
pilgrimage for alms, and coming to Benares stayed in the park. Next day
he went into the town to beg. The king saw him with favour, made him
come up into the palace and sit on the throne, waited on him with
various delicate kinds of food, both hard and soft, and received his
thanks: being pleased that the paccekabuddha should stay in his park, he
exacted a promise and sent him back thither: after his morning meal he
went there in person, arranged the places for his habitation by night

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

and day, gave him the park-keeper Sumaṅgala as attendant, and went back
to the town. After that the paccekabuddha had meals constantly in the
palace and lived there a long time: Sumaṅgala respectfully attended on
him. One day he went away, saying to Sumaṅgala, "I am going to such and
such a village for a few days, but will come back: inform the king."
Sumaṅgala informed the king. After a few days' stay in that village the
paccekabuddha came back to the park in the evening after sunset. \[440\]
Sumaṅgala, not knowing of his arrival, had gone to his own house. The
paccekabuddha put away his bowl and robe, and after a little walk sat
down on a stone-slab. That day some strange guests had come to the
park-keeper's house. To get them soup and curry he had gone with a bow
to kill a tame deer in the park: he was there looking for a deer when he
saw the paccekabuddha and thinking he was a great deer, he aimed an
arrow and shot him. The paccekabuddha uncovered his head and said,
"Sumaṅgala." Greatly moved Sumaṅgala said, "Sir, I knew not of your
coming and shot you, thinking you were a deer: forgive me." "Very well,
but what will you do now? Come, pull out the arrow." He made obeisance
and pulled it out. The paccekabuddha felt great pain and passed into
nirvāna then and there. The park-keeper thought the king would not
pardon him if he knew: he took his wife and children and fled. By
supernatural power the whole city heard that the paccekabuddha had
entered nirvāna, and all were greatly excited. Next day some men entered
the park, saw the body and told the king that the park-keeper had fled
after killing the paccekabuddha. The king went with a great retinue and
for seven days paid honour to the body: then with all ceremony he took
the relics, built a shrine, and doing honour to it went on ruling his
kingdom righteously. After a year, Sumaṅgala determined to find out what
the king thought: he came and asked a minister whom he saw to find out
what the king thought of him. The minister praised Sumaṅgala before the
king: but he was as if he heard not. The minister said no more, but told
Sumaṅgala that the king was not pleased with him. After another year he
came, and again in the third year he brought his wife and children. The
minister knew the king was appeased \[441\], and setting Sumaṅgala at
the palace-door told the king of his coming. The king sent for him, and
after greeting said, "Sumaṅgala, why did you kill that paccekabuddha,
through whom I was gaining merit?" "O king, I did not mean to kill him,
but it was in this way that I did the deed," and he told the story. The
king bade him have no fear, and reassuring him made him park-keeper
again. Then the minister asked, "O king, why did you make no answer when
you heard Sumaṅgala's praises twice, and on the third hearing why did
you send for him and forgive him?" The king said, "Dear sir, it is wrong
for a king to do anything hastily in his anger: therefore I was silent
at first and the third time when I

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

knew I was appeased I sent for Sumaṅgala": and so he spoke these stanzas
to declare the duty of a king:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Conscious of an angry frown,  
    Ne’er let king stretch out his rod:  
Things unworthy of a crown  
    Then would follow from his nod.

Conscious of a milder mood,  
    Let him judgments harsh decree,  
When the case is understood,  
    Fix the proper penalty:

Self nor others will he vex,  
    Clearly parting right from wrong:  
Though his yoke is on men's necks,  
    Virtue holds him high and strong.

Princes reckless in their deed  
    Ply the rod remorselessly,  
Ill repute is here their meed,  
    Hell awaits them when they die.

\[442\] They who love the saintly law,  
    Pure in deed and word and thought,  
Filled with kindness, calm and awe,  
    Pass through both worlds as they ought.

King am I, my people's lord;  
    Anger shall not check my bent:  
When to vice I take the sword,  
    Pity prompts the punishment.

</div>

\[443\] So the king declared his own good qualities in six stanzas: his
whole court were pleased and declared his merits in the words, "Such
excellence in moral practices and qualities is worthy of your majesty."
Sumaṅgala, after the court had finished speaking, saluted the king, and
after obeisance spoke three stanzas in the king's praise:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Such thy glory and thy power;  
Ne’er resign them for an hour:  
Free from anger, free from fears,  
Reign in joy a hundred years.

Prince, whom all those virtues bless,  
    Mild and bland, but firm in worth,  
Rule the world with righteousness,  
    Pass to heaven when freed from earth.

True in word, in action good,  
    Take the means thy end to gain:  
Calm the troubled multitude,  
    As a cloud with genial rain.

</div>

\[444\] After the lesson connected with the admonition of the Kosala
king, the Master identified the Birth: "At that time the paccekabuddha
passed into nirvāna, Sumaṅgala was Ānanda, the king was myself."
