#### CULLADHAMMAPĀLA-JĀTAKA.

*"Mahāpatāpa's wretched queen," etc.*—This story the Master, when
dwelling n. the Bamboo Grove, told concerning the going about of
Devadatta to slay the Bodhisatta. In all other Births Devadatta failed
to excite so much as an atom of fear in the Bodhisatta, \[178\] but in
the Culladhammapāla Birth, when the Bodhisatta was only seven months
old, he had his hands and feet and head cut off and his body encircled
with sword cuts, as it were with a garland. In the Daddara <span
id="fr_67"></span>[1](#fn_67) Birth he killed him by twisting his neck,
and roasted his flesh in an oven and ate it. In the Khantivādi <span
id="fr_68"></span>[2](#fn_68) Birth he had him scourged with two
thousand strokes of a whip, and ordered his hands and feet and ears and
nose to be cut off, and then had him seized by the hair of his head and
dragged along, and when he was stretched at full length on his back, he
kicked him in the belly and made off, and that very day the Bodhisatta
died. But both in the Cullanandaka and the Vevaṭiyakapi <span
id="fr_69"></span>[3](#fn_69) Births he merely had him put to death.
Thus did Devadatta for a long time go about to slay him, and continued
to do so, even after he became a Buddha. So one day they raised a
discussion in the Hall of

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Truth, saying,
"Sirs, Devadatta is continually forming plots to slay the Buddhas. Being
minded to kill the Supreme Buddha, he suborned archers to shoot him, he
threw down a rock upon him, and let loose the elephant Nālāgiri on him."
When the Master came and inquired what subject the Brethren were
assembled to discuss, on hearing what it was he said, "Brethren, not now
only, but formerly too he went about to kill me, but now he fails to
excite a particle of fear in me, though formerly when I was prince
Dhammapāla he brought about my death, though I was his own son, by
encircling my body with sword cuts, as it were with a garland." And so
saying, he related a story of the past.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time when Mahāpatāpa was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta
came to life as the son of his queen-consort Candā and they named him
Dhammapāla. When he was seven months old, his mother had him bathed in
scented water and richly dressed and sat playing with him. The king came
to the place of her abode. And as she was playing with the boy, being
filled with a mother's love for her child, she omitted to rise up on
seeing the king. He thought, "Even now this woman is filled with pride
on account of her boy, and does not value me a straw, but as the boy
grows up, she will think, "I have a man for my son," and will take no
notice of me. I will have him put to death at once." So he returned
home, and sitting on his throne summoned the executioner into his
presence, with all the instruments of his office. \[179\] The man put on
his yellow robe and wearing a crimson wreath laid his axe upon his
shoulder, and carrying a block and a bowl in his hands, came and stood
before the king, and saluting him said, "What is your pleasure, Sire?"

"Go to the royal closet of the queen, and bring hither Dhammapāla," said
the king.

But the queen knew that the king had left her in a rage, and laid the
Bodhisatta on her bosom and sat weeping. The executioner came and giving
her a blow in the back snatched the boy out of her arms and took him to
the king and said, "What is your pleasure, Sire?" The king had a board
brought and put down before him, and said, "Lay him down on it." The man
did so. But queen Candā came and stood just behind her son, weeping.
Again the executioner said, "What is your pleasure, Sire?" "Cut off
Dhammapāla's hands," said the king. Queen Candā said, "Great king, my
boy is only a child, seven months old. He knows nothing. The fault is
not his. If there be any fault, it is mine. Therefore bid my hands to be
cut off." And to make her meaning clear, she uttered the first stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mahāpatāpa's wretched queen,  
’Tis I alone to blame have been.  
Bid Dhammapāla, Sire, go free,  
And off with hands of luckless me.

</div>

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

The king looked at the executioner. "What is your pleasure, Sire?"
"Without further delay, off with his hands," said the king. At this
moment the executioner took a sharp axe, and lopped off the boy's two
hands, as if they had been young bamboo shoots. \[180\] The boy, when
his hands were cut off, neither wept nor lamented, but moved by patience
and charity bore it with resignation. But the queen Candā put the tips
of his fingers in her lap and stained with blood went about lamenting.
Again the executioner asked, "What is your pleasure, Sire?" "Off with
his feet," said the king. On hearing this, Candā uttered the second
stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mahāpatāpa's wretched queen,  
’Tis I alone to blame have been.  
Bid Dhammapāla, Sire, go free,  
And off with feet of luckless me.

</div>

But the king gave a sign to the executioner, and he cut off both his
feet. Queen Candā put his feet also in her lap, and stained with blood,
lamented and said, "My lord Mahāpatāpa, his feet and hands are cut off.
A mother is bound to support her children. I will work for wages and
support my son. Give him to me." The executioner said, "Sire, is the
king's pleasure fulfilled? Is my service finished?" "Not yet," said the
king. "What then is your pleasure, Sire?" "Off with his head," said the
king. Then Candā repeated the third stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mahāpatāpa's wretched queen,  
’Tis I alone to blame have been.  
Bid Dhammapāla, Sire, go free,  
And off with head of luckless me.

</div>

And with these words she offered her own head. Again the executioner
asked, "What is your pleasure, Sire?" "Off with his head," said the
king. So he cut off his head and asked, "Is the king's pleasure
fulfilled?" "Not yet," said the king. "What further am I to do, Sire?"
"Catching him with the edge of the sword," said the king, "encircle him
with sword cuts as it were with a garland." Then he threw the body of
the boy up into the air, and catching it with the edge of his sword,
encircled him with sword cuts, as it were with a garland, and scattered
the bits on the dais. Candā placed the flesh of the Bodhisatta in her
lap, and as she sat on the dais lamenting, she repeated these stanzas:—

\[181\] <span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

No friendly councillors advise the king,  
"Slay not the heir that from thy loins did spring":  
No loving kinsmen urge the tender plea,  
"Slay not the boy that owes his life to thee."

</div>

Moreover after speaking these two stanzas queen Candā, pressing both her
hands upon her heart, repeated the third stanza:—

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Thou, Dhammapāla, wert by right of birth  
    The lord of earth:  
Thy arms, once bathed in oil of sandal wood,  
    Lie steeped in blood.  
My fitful breath alas! is choked with sighs  
    And broken cries.

</div>

While she was thus lamenting, her heart broke, as a bamboo snaps, when
the grove is on fire, and she fell dead on the spot. The king too being
unable to remain on his throne fell down on the dais. An abyss was cleft
asunder in the ground, and straightway he fell into it. Then the solid
earth, though many myriads more than two hundred thousand leagues in
thickness, being unable to bear with his wickedness, clave asunder and
opened a chasm. A flame arose out of the Avīci hell, and seizing upon
him, wrapped him about, as with a royal woollen garment, \[182\] and
plunged him into Avīci. His ministers performed the funeral rites of
Candā and the Bodhisatta.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Master, having brought this discourse to an end, identified the
Birth: "At that time Devadatta was the king, Mahāpajāpatī was Candā, and
I myself was prince Dhammapāla."
