*"Fragrant odours," etc.*—This story was told by the Master while
residing at Jetavana, of a certain Brother who regretted having taken
orders. On this occasion the Master asked the Brother if it were true
that he was discontented, and on his answering, "Yes, Holy Sir," he
asked him the reason. The Brother replied, "By reason of sinful
passion." The Master said, "Woman cannot be guarded. There is no keeping
her safe. Sages of old placed a woman in mid ocean in a palace by the
Simbalī lake <span id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37), but failed to preserve
her honour." Then he told a story of the olden time.

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta came to life as the son of the king by his queen-consort. And
when he was grown up, at his father's death he bare rule. Kākāti was his
chief queen and as lovely as an Apsara. \[91\] The old form of the
legend will be found set forth in full in the Kunāḷa Birth. <span
id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_38) Here follows a brief summary of it.

Now at this time a certain Garuḍa king came disguised as a man, and
played at dice with the king of Benares. Falling in love with the chief
queen Kākāti, he carried her off with him to the dwelling place of the
Garuḍas and lived happily with her. The king missing her told his
musician named Naṭakuvera to go in quest of her. He found the Garuḍa
king lying on a bed of eraka grass in a certain lake, and just as the
Garuḍa was on the point of leaving that spot, he seated himself in the
midst of the royal bird's plumage, <span id="fr_39"></span>[2](#fn_39)
and was in this way conveyed to the dwelling place of the Garuḍas. There
he enjoyed the lady's favours, and again seating himself on the bird's
wing returned home. And when the time came for the Garuḍa to play at
dice with the king, the minstrel took his lute and going up to the
gaming board he stood before the king, and in the form of a song gave
utterance to the first stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Fragrant odours round me playing  
    Breath of fair Kākāti's love,  
From her distant home conveying  
    Thoughts my inmost soul to move.

</div>

On hearing this the Garuḍa responded in a second stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Sea and Kebuk stream defying  
    Didst thou reach my island home?  
Over seven oceans flying  
    To the Simbal grove didst come?

</div>

\[92\] Naṭakuvera, on hearing this, uttered the third stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

’Twas through thee all space defying  
    I was borne to Simbal grove,  
And o’er seas and rivers flying  
    ’Twas through thee I found my love.

</div>

Then the Garuḍa king replied in the fourth stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Out upon the foolish blunder,  
    What a booby I have been!  
Lovers best were kept asunder,  
    Lo! I've served as go-between.

</div>

So the Garuḍa brought the queen and gave her back to the king of
Benares, and came not there any more.

The Master, his lesson ended, revealed the Truths and identified the
Birth:— At the conclusion of the Truths the discontented Brother
attained the fruition of the First Path:— "At that time the discontented
Brother was Naṭakuvera, and I myself was the king."
