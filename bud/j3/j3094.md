#### VIGHĀSA-JĀTAKA.

*"Happy life is theirs," etc.*—The Master told this tale while dwelling
in the East Garden, concerning some Brethren who were given to
amusement. The great Moggallāna had shaken their dwelling and alarmed
them. The Brethren sat discussing their fault in the Hall of Truth. The
Master being told this said to them, "They are not given to amusement
for the first time," and so told an old tale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta was Sakka. Seven brothers in a certain village of Kāsi seeing
the evil of desires had renounced them and become ascetics: they dwelt
in Mejjhārañña but lived in various kinds of amusement, not practising
devotion diligently and being of full habit of body. Sakka, king of
gods, said, "I will alarm them;" and so he became a parrot, came to
their dwelling-place and perching on a tree spoke the first stanza to
alarm them:—

\[311\]<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Happy life is theirs who live on remnants left from charity:  
Praise in this world is their lot, and in the next felicity.

</div>

Then one of them hearing the parrot's words called to the rest, and
spoke the second stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Should not wise men listen when a parrot speaks in human tongue:  
Hearken, brethren: ’tis our praises clearly that this bird has sung.

</div>

Then the parrot denying this spoke the third stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Not your praises I am singing, carrion-eaters: list to me,  
Refuse is the food you eat, not remnants left from charity.

</div>

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

When they heard him, they all together spoke the fourth stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Seven years ordained, with duly tonsured hair,  
    In Mejjhārañña here we spend our days,  
Living on remnants: if you blame our fare,  
    Who is it then you praise?

</div>

The Great Being spoke the fifth stanza, putting them to shame:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Leavings of the lion, tiger, ravening beast, are your supply:  
Refuse truly, though ye call it remnants left from charity.

</div>

\[312\] Hearing him the ascetics said, "If we are not eaters of
remnants, then who pray are?" Then he telling them the true meaning
spoke the sixth stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

They who giving alms to priests and brahmins, wants to satisfy  
Eat the rest, ’tis they who live on remnants left from charity.

</div>

So the Bodhisatta put them to shame and went to his own place.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the lesson, the Master declared the Truths and identified the
Birth: "At that time the seven brothers were the sportive Brethren,
Sakka was myself."
