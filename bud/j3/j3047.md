#### KESAVA-JĀTAKA.

*"Thou that of late," etc.*—This story the Master while at Jetavana told
concerning the Feast of Friendship.

In the house of Anāthapiṇdika, they say, five hundred Brethren were
constantly fed. \[142\] The house was continually like a place of
refreshment for the assembly of the Brethren, bright with the sheen of
their yellow robes and blown upon with saintly odours. So one day the
king in making a solemn procession

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

round the city caught sight of the assembly of the Brethren in the
Treasurer's house, and thinking, "I too will grant a perpetual alms to
the assembly of saints," he went to the monastery and after greeting the
Master he instituted perpetual alms for five hundred Brethren.
Thenceforth there is a perpetual giving of alms in the king's house,
even choice food of rice with the perfume of the rain upon it, but there
are none to give it with their own hands, with marks of affection and
love, but the king's ministers dispense the food, and the Brethren do
not care to sit down and eat it, but taking the various dainty foods,
they go each to the house of his own retainers, and giving them the
food, themselves eat whatever is set before them, whether coarse or
dainty.

Now one day much wild fruit was brought to the king. The king said,
"Give it to the Order of the Brethren."

They went to the refectory and came and told the king, "There is not a
single Brother there."

"What, is it not time yet?" said the king.

"Yes it is time," they said, "but the Brethren take the food in your
house, and then go to the abode of their trusty servitors, and give the
food to them, and themselves eat whatsoever is served up to them,
whether it be coarse or dainty."

The king said, "Our food is dainty. Why in the world do they abstain
from ours and eat some other food?" And thinking, "I will inquire of the
Master," he went to the monastery and asked him.

The Master said, "The best food is that which is given in love. Owing to
the absence of those who by giving in love establish friendly feeling,
the Brethren take the food and eat it in some friendly place of their
own. There is no flavour, Sire, equal to that of love. That which is
given without love, though it be composed of the four sweet things, is
not worth so much as wild rice given with love. Wise men of old, when
sickness arose amongst them, though the king with his five families of
leeches provided remedies, if the sickness were not thus assuaged,
repaired to their intimate friends and by eating broth of wild rice and
millet, without salt, or even leaves without salt, sprinkled with water
only, were healed of their sickness." And with these words at their
request he told them a story of the past.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family in the kingdom of Kāsi, \[143\]
and they called him young Kappa. When he came of age, he acquired all
the arts at Takkasilā and afterwards adopted the religious life. At this
time an ascetic named Kesava attended by five hundred other ascetics
became the teacher of a band of disciples and abode in the Himālayas.
The Bodhisatta came to him and becoming the senior of the five hundred
pupils, dwelt there and shewed a friendly feeling and affection for
Kesava. And they became very intimate one with another.

By and bye Kesava accompanied by these ascetics went to Benares to
procure salt and vinegar and lodged in the king's garden. Next day he
went into the city and came to the palace door. When the king saw the
band of holy men, he invited them in and fed them in his own house, and
exacting the usual promise from them, he lodged them in his garden. So
when the rainy season was over, Kesava took leave of the king. The king
said, "Holy Sir, you are an old man. Do you now dwell near us, and send

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

the young ascetics to the Himālayas." He agreed and sent them with the
head disciple to the Himālayas and himself was left quite alone. Kappa
went to the Himālayas and dwelt there with the ascetics. Kesava was
unhappy at being deprived of the society of Kappa, and in his desire to
see him got no sleep, and in consequence of losing his sleep, his food
was not properly digested. A bloody flux set in, followed by severe
pains. The king with his five families of leeches watched over the
ascetic, but his sickness abated not.

The ascetic asked the king, "Do you, Sire, wish for me to die or to
recover?"

"To recover, Sir," he answered.

"Then send me to the Himālayas," he said.

"Agreed," said the king, and sent to a minister named Nārada, and bade
him go with some foresters and take the holy man to the Himālayas.
Nārada took him there and returned home. But by the mere sight of Kappa,
Kesava's mental disorder ceased and his unhappiness subsided. \[144\] So
Kappa gave him broth made of millet and wild rice together with leaves
sprinkled with water, without salt and spices, and at that very instant
the dysentery was assuaged. The king again sent Nārada saying, "Go and
learn tidings of the ascetic Kesava." He came and finding him recovered
said, "Reverend Sir, the king of Benares treating you with his five
families of leeches could not heal your sickness. How did Kappa treat
you?" And herewith he uttered the first stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Thou that of late with lord of men didst dwell,  
    A king prepared to grant thy heart's desire,  
What is the charm of Kappa's hermit cell  
    That blessed Kesava should here retire?

</div>

Kesava on hearing this repeated the second stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

All here is charming: e’en the very trees  
    O Nārada, my fancy take,  
And Kappa's words that never fail to please  
    A grateful echo in my heart awake.

</div>

After these words he said: "Kappa by way of pleasing me gave me to drink
broth made of millet and wild rice mixed with leaves sprinkled with
water, and without salt and spices, and therewith was my bodily sickness
stayed and I was healed."

Nārada, hearing this, repeated the third stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Thou that but now the purest rice didst eat  
Boiled with a dainty flavouring of meat,  
How canst thou relish such insipid fare  
And millet and wild rice with hermits share?

</div>

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

\[145\] On hearing this Kesava uttered the fourth stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The food may coarse or dainty prove,  
    May scanty be or much abound,  
Yet if the meal is blest with love,  
    Love the best sauce by far is found.

</div>

Nārada on hearing his words returned to the king and told him, "Kesava
says thus and thus."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Master, having ended his lesson, identified the Birth: "At that time
the king was Ānanda, Nārada was Sāriputta, Kesava was Bakabrahmā, <span
id="fr_56"></span>[1](j3048.htm#fn_56.md) Kappa was myself."
