*"You were never," etc.*—The Master told this tale while dwelling in
Jetavana, concerning a certain Brother. The story is that the Brother
had left Jetavana and dwelt in the Kosala kingdom near a certain wood:
one day he went down into a lotus-pool \[308\], and seeing a lotus in
flower he stood to leeward and smelt

it. Then the goddess who dwelt in that part of the forest frightened him
saying, "Sir, you are a thief of odours, this is a kind of theft." He
went back in a fright to Jetavana, and saluted the Master and sat down.
"Where have you been staying, Brother?" "In such and such a wood, and
the goddess frightened me in such and such a way." The Master said, "You
are not the first who have been frightened by a goddess when smelling a
flower; sages of old have been frightened in like manner," and at the
Brother's request he told an old tale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family of a village in Kāsi: when he
grew up he learned the arts at Takkasilā, and afterwards became an
ascetic and lived near a lotus-pool. One day he went down into the pool
and stood smelling a lotus in full flower. A goddess who was in a hollow
in a trunk of a tree alarming him spoke the first stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

You were never given that flower you smell, though it's only a single
bloom;  
’Tis a species of larceny, reverend sir, you are stealing its perfume.

</div>

Then the Bodhisatta spoke the second stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I neither take nor break the flower: from afar I smell the bloom.  
I cannot tell on what pretence you say I steal perfume.

</div>

At the same moment a man was digging in the pool for lotus-fibres and
breaking the lotus-plants. The Bodhisatta seeing him said, "You call a
man thief if he smells the flower from afar: \[309\] why do you not
speak to that other man?" So in talk with her he spoke the third
stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A man who digs the lotus-roots and breaks the stalks I see:  
Why don't you call the conduct of that man disorderly?

</div>

The goddess, explaining why she did not speak to him, spoke the fourth
and fifth stanzas:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Disgusting like a nurse's dress are men disorderly:  
I have no speech with men like him, but I deign to speak to thee.

When a man is free from evil stains and seeks for purity,  
A sin like a hair-tip shows on him like a dark cloud in the sky.

</div>

So alarmed by her the Bodhisatta in emotion spoke the sixth stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Surely, fairy, you know me well, to pity me you deign:  
If you see me do the like offence, pray speak to me again.

</div>

Then the goddess spoke to him the seventh stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I am not here to serve you, no hireling folk are we:  
Find, Brother, for yourself the path to reach felicity.

</div>

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

\[310\] So exhorting him she entered her own abode. The Bodhisatta
entered on high meditation and was born in the Brahmaloka world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The lesson ended, the Master declared the Truths, and identified the
Birth:—at the end of the Truths, the Brother was established in the
fruit of the First Path:—"At that time the goddess was Uppalavaṇṇā, the
ascetic myself."
