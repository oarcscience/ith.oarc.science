*"One that plays," etc.*—This story was told by the Master, while living
at Jetavana, with regard to a certain cheating rogue. The introductory
story has been already given in full. But oh this occasion they brought
the Brother to the Master and exposed him, saying, "Holy Sir, this
Brother is a cheat." The Master said, "Not now only, but formerly also
he was a rogue." And then he told an old-world story.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta was born as a young lizard, and when he grew up and was lusty
and strong, he dwelt in a forest. And a certain wicked ascetic built a
hut of leaves, and took up his abode near him. The Bodhisatta, in
ranging about for food, saw this hut of leaves and thought to himself,

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "This hut must
certainly belong to some holy ascetic," and he went there and after
saluting the holy man returned to his own place of abode.

Now one day this false ascetic ate some savoury food prepared in the
house of one of his retainers, and asked what meat it was. On hearing
that it was lizard-flesh, he became such a slave to his love of dainties
that he thought, "I will kill this lizard that so constantly keeps
coming to my hermitage and will cook him to my taste and eat him." So he
took some ghee, curds, condiments and the like, and went with his club
concealed under his yellow robe and sat perfectly still at the door of
his hut, waiting for the Bodhisatta to come, as quiet as quiet could be.

\[85\] And when the Bodhisatta saw this depraved fellow he thought,
"This wretch must have been eating the flesh of my kinsfolk. I will put
it to the test." So he stood to leeward of him and getting a whiff from
his person he knew that he had been eating the flesh of a lizard, and
without going near him he turned back and made off. And when the ascetic
saw he was not coming, he threw his club at him. The club missed his
body, but just reached the tip of his tail. The ascetic said, "Be off
with you, I have missed you." Said the Bodhisatta, "Yes, you have missed
me, but you will not miss the fourfold States of Suffering." Than he ran
off and disappeared in an ant-hill which stood at the end of the
cloister walk, and putting out his head at some other hole, he addressed
the ascetic in these two stanzas:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

One that plays the ascetic rōle  
Should exhibit self-control.  
Thou didst hurl thy stick at me,  
False ascetic thou must be.

Matted locks and robe of skin  
Serve to cloke some secret sin.  
Fool! to cleanse for outward show,  
Leaving what is foul below.

</div>

The ascetic, on hearing this, replied in a third stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Prithee, lizard, hasten back,  
Oil and salt I do not lack:  
Pepper too I would suggest  
May to boiled rice add a zest.

</div>

\[86\] The Bodhisatta, on hearing this, uttered the fourth stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I will hide me snug and warm  
Midst the anthill's myriad swarm.  
Cease of oil and salt to prate,  
Pepper I abominate.

</div>

Moreover he threatened him and said, "Fie! false ascetic, if you
continue to dwell here, I will have you seized as a thief by the people
who

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

live in my feeding ground, and given over to destruction. So make haste
and be off." Then the false ascetic fled from that place.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Master, his lesson ended, identified the Birth: "At that time the
rogue of a Brother was the false ascetic, but I myself was the royal
lizard."
