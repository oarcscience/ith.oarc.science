#### TUṆḌILA-JĀTAKA.

*"Something strange to-day," etc.* The Master told this tale while
dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a brother who feared death. He was born
in Sāvatthi of good family and was ordained in the Faith: but he feared
death and when he heard even a little moving of a bough, or falling of a
stick or voice of bird or

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

beast or any such thing, he was frightened by the fear of death, and
went away shaking like a hare wounded in the belly. The Brethren in the
Hall of Truth began to discuss, saying, "Sirs, they say a certain
Brother, fearing death, runs away shaking when he hears even a little
sound: now to beings in this world death is certain, life uncertain, and
should not this be wisely borne in mind?" The Master found that this was
their subject and that the Brother allowed he was afraid of death: so he
said, "Brethren, he is not afraid of death for the first time," and so
he told an old tale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta
was conceived by a wild sow: in due time she brought forth two male
young. One day she took them and lay down in a pit. An old woman of a
village at the gate of Benares was coming home with a basket-full of
cotton from the cotton field \[287\] and tapping the ground with her
stick. The sow heard the sound, and in fear of death left her young and
ran away. The old woman saw the young pigs, and feeling towards them as
to children of her own she put them in the basket and took them home:
then she called the elder Mahātuṇḍila (Big-snout), the younger
Cullatuṇḍila (Little-snout), and reared them like children. In time they
grew up and became fat. When the old woman was asked to sell them for
money, she answered, "They are my children," and would not sell them. On
a certain feast-day some lewd fellows were drinking strong drink, and
when their meat was done they considered where they could get meat:
finding out that there were pigs in the old woman's house, they took
money and going there, said, "Mother, take this money and give us one of
those pigs." She said, "Enough, young men: are there people who would
give their children to buyers to eat their flesh?" and so refused them.
The fellows said, "Mother, pigs cannot be children of men, give them to
us": but they could not get this though they asked again and again. Then
they made the old woman drink strong drink, and when she was drunk,
saying, "Mother, what will you do with the pigs? take the money and
spend it," they put pieces of money in her hand. She took the pieces
saying, "I cannot give you Mahātuṇḍila, take Cullatuṇḍila." "Where is
he?" "There he is in that bush." "Call him." "I don't see any food for
him." The fellows sent for a vessel of rice at a price. The old woman
took it, and filling the pig's trough which stood at the door she waited
by it. Thirty fellows stood by with nooses in their hands. The old woman
called him, "Come, little Cullatuṇḍila, come." \[288\] Mahātuṇḍila,
hearing this, thought, "All this time mother has never given the call to
Cullatuṇḍila, she always calls me first; certainly some danger must have
arisen for us to-day." He told his younger brother, saying, "Brother,
mother is calling you, go and find out." He went out, and seeing them
standing by the food-trough he thought, "Death is come upon me to-day,"

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

and so in fear of death he turned back shaking to his brother; and when
he came back he could not contain himself but reeled about shaking.
Mahātuṇḍila seeing him said, "Brother, you are shaking to-day and
reeling and watching the entrance: why are you doing so?" He, explaining
the thing that he had seen, spoke the first stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Something strange to-day I fear:  
    The trough is full, and mistress by;  
Men, noose in hand, are standing near:  
    To eat appears a jeopardy.

</div>

Then the Bodhisatta hearing him said, "Brother Cullatuṇḍila, the purpose
for which my mother rears pigs all this time \[289\] has to-day come to
its fulfilment: do not grieve," and so with sweet voice and the ease of
a Buddha he expounded the law and spoke two stanzas:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

You fear, and look for aid, and quake,  
    But, helpless, whither can you flee?  
We're fattened for our flesh's sake:  
    Eat, Tuṇḍila, and cheerfully.

Plunge bold into the crystal pool,  
    Wash all the stains of sweat away:  
You'll find our ointment wonderful,  
    Whose fragrance never can decay.

</div>

As he considered the Ten Perfections, setting the Perfection of Love
before him as his guide, and uttered the first line, his voice reached
and extended to Benares over the whole twelve leagues. At the instant of
hearing it, the people of Benares from kings and viceroys downwards
came, and those who did not come stood listening in their houses. The
king's men breaking down the bush levelled the ground and scattered
sand. The drunkenness left the lewd fellows, and throwing away the
nooses they stood listening to the law: and the old woman's drunkenness
left her also. The Bodhisatta began to preach the law to Cullatuṇḍila
among the multitude.

\[290\] Cullatuṇḍila hearing him, thought, "My brother says so to me:
but it is never our custom to plunge into the pool, and by bathing to
wash away sweat from our bodies and after taking away old stain to get
new ointment: why does my brother say so to me?" So he spoke the fourth
stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

But what is that fair crystal pool,  
    And what the stains of sweat, I pray?  
And what the ointment wonderful,  
    Whose fragrance never can decay?

</div>

The Bodhisatta hearing this said, "Then listen with attentive ear," and
so expounding the law with the ease of a Buddha he spoke these stanzas:—

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The law is the fair crystal pool,  
    Sin is the stain of sweat, they say:  
Virtue's the ointment wonderful,  
    Whose fragrance never will decay.

Men that lose their life are glad,  
    Men that keep it feel annoy:  
Men should die and not be sad,  
    As at mid-month's festal joy.

</div>

\[292\] So the Great Being expounded the law in a sweet voice with a
Buddha's charm. The multitude by thousands snapped their fingers and
waved their cloths, and the air was full of the cry, "Good, good." The
king of Benares honoured the Bodhisatta with royal place, and giving
glory to the old woman he caused both pigs to be bathed in perfumed
water, and clothed with robes, and ornamented with jewels on the neck,
and put them in the position of his sons in the city: so he guarded them
with a great retinue. The Bodhisatta gave the five commands to the king,
and all the inhabitants of Benares and Kāsi kept the commands. The
Bodhisatta preached the law to them on the holy days (new and full
moon), and sitting in judgment decided cases: while he lived there were
no bringers of unjust suits. Afterwards the king died. The Bodhisatta
did the last honours to his body: then he caused a book of judgments to
be written and said, "By observing this book ye should settle suits ":
so having expounded the Law to the people and preached to them with
zeal, he went to the forest with Cullatuṇḍila while they all wept and
lamented. Then the Bodhisatta's preaching went on for sixty thousand
years.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\[293\] After the lesson, the Master declared the Truths and identified
the Birth:—at the end of the Truths the Brother who feared death was
established in the fruition of the first Path:—"In those days the king
was Ānanda, Cullatuṇḍila was the Brother who fears death, the multitude
was the Congregation, Mahātuṇḍila myself."
