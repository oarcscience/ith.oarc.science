*"I scent the fragrance," etc.*—This story the Master, while living at
Jetavana, told concerning a backsliding Brother. The Master asked if it
were true that he longed for the world, and what he had seen to make him
regret having taken orders. The Brother answered, "It was all owing to
the charms of a woman." The Master said, "Verily, Brother, there is no
possibility of being on one's guard against womenfolk. Sages of old,
though they took the precaution to dwell in the abode of the Garuḍas,
failed to be on their guard against them." And being urged by him, the
Master related a story of the past.

Once upon a time king Tamba reigned in Benares, and his queen-consort
named Sussondī was a woman of surpassing beauty. At that time the
Bodhisatta came to life as a young Garuḍa. Now the Nāga island was then
known as Seruma island, and the Bodhisatta lived on this island in the
abode of the Garuḍas. And he went to Benares, disguised as a youth, and
played at dice with king Tamba. Remarking his beauty they said to
Sussondī, "Such and such a youth plays at dice with our king." She
longed to see him, and one day she adorned herself and repaired to the
dice-chamber. \[188\] There taking her stand amongst the attendants, she
fixed her gaze on the youth. He too gazed on the queen, and the pair
fell in love with one another. The Garuḍa king by an act of supernatural
power stirred up a storm in the city. The people, through fear of the
house falling, fled out of the palace. By his power he caused it to be
dark, and carrying off the queen with him in the air, he made his way to
his own abode in Nāga island. But no one knew of the coming or going of
Sussondī. The Garuḍa took his pleasure with her, and still came to play
at dice with the king. Now the king had a minstrel named Sagga, and not
knowing where the queen had gone, the king addressed the minstrel and
said, "Go now and explore every land and sea, and discover what has
become of the queen." And so saying he bade him begone.

He took what was necessary for his journey, and beginning the search
from the city gate, at last came to Bhārukaccha. At that time certain
merchants of Bhārukaccha were setting sail for the Golden Land. He
approached them and said, "I am a minstrel. If you remit my passage
money, I will act as your minstrel. Take me with you." They agreed to do
so, and putting him on board weighed anchor. When the ship was fairly
off, they called him and bade him make music for them. He said, "I would
make music, but if I do, the fish will be so excited that your vessel
will be wrecked." "If a mere mortal," they said, "make music, there will
be no excitement on the part of the fish. Play to us." "Then do not be
angry with me," he said, and tuning his lute and keeping perfect harmony
between the words of his song and the accompaniment of the lute string,
he made music for them. The fish were maddened at the sound and splashed
about. And a certain sea monster leaping up fell upon the ship and broke
it in two. Sagga lying on a plank was carried along by the wind till he
reached a banyan tree in the Nāga island, where the Garuḍa king lived.
Now queen Sussondī, whenever the Garuḍa king went to play at dice, came
down from her place of abode, \[189\] and as she was wandering on the
edge of the shore, she saw and recognized the minstrel Sagga, and asked
him how he got there. He told her the whole story. And she comforted him
and said, "Do not be afraid," and embracing him in her arms, she carried
him to her abode and laid him on a couch. And when he was greatly
revived, she fed him with heavenly

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

food, bathed him in heavenly scented-water, arrayed him in heavenly
raiment, and adorned him with flowers of heavenly perfume, and made him
recline upon a heavenly couch. Thus did she watch over him, and whenever
the Garuḍa king returned, she hid her lover, and so soon as the king was
gone, under the influence of passion she took her pleasure with him. At
the end of a month and a half from that time some merchants, who dwelt
at Benares, landed at the foot of the banyan tree in this island, to get
fire-wood and water. The minstrel went on board ship with them, and on
reaching Benares, as soon as he saw the king, while he was playing at
dice, Sagga took his lute, and making music recited the first stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I scent the fragrance of the timira grove,  
     I hear the moaning of the weary sea:  
Tamba, I am tormented with my love,  
    For fair Sussondī dwells afar from me.

</div>

On hearing this the Garuḍa king uttered the second stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

How didst thou cross the stormy main,  
And Seruma in safety gain?  
How didst thou Sagga, tell me, pray,  
To fair Sussondī win thy way?

</div>

\[190\] Then Sagga repeated three stanzas:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

With trading-folk from Bhārukaccha land  
    My ship was wrecked by monsters of the sea;  
I on a plank did safely gain the strand,  
When an anointed queen with gentle hand  
    Upbore me tenderly upon her knee,  
    As though to her a true son I might be.  
She food and raiment brought, and as I lay  
With love-lorn eyes hung o’er my couch all day.  
Know, Tamba, well; this word is sooth I say.

</div>

The Garuḍa, while the minstrel thus spake, was filled with regrets and
said: "Though I dwelt in the abode of the Garuḍas, I failed to guard her
safely. What is this wicked woman to me?" So he brought her back and
presented her to the king and departed. And thenceforth he came not
there any more.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Master, his lesson ended, declared the Truths and identified the
Birth:—At the conclusion of the Truths the worldly-minded Brother
attained fruition of the First Path:—"At that time Ānanda was the king
of Benares, and I myself was the Garuḍa king."
