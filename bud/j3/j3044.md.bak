*"Long I held," etc.*—This story was told by the Master at Jetavana,
concerning a heron that lived in the house of the king of Kosala. She
carried messages, they say, for the king, and had two young ones. The
king sent this bird with a letter to some other king. When she was gone
away, the boys in the royal family squeezed the young birds to death in
their hands. The mother bird came back and missing her young ones, asked
who had killed her offspring. They said, "So and So." And at this time
there was a fierce and savage tiger kept in the palace, fastened by a
strong chain. Now these boys came to see the tiger and the heron went
with them, thinking, "Even as my young ones were killed by them, just so
will I deal with these boys," and she took hold of them and threw them
down at the foot of the tiger. The tiger with a growl crunched them up.
The bird said, "Now is the wish of my heart fulfilled," and flying up
into the air made straight for the Himālayas. On hearing what had
happened they started a discussion in the Hall of Truth, saying, \[135\]
"Sirs, a heron, it is said, in the king's palace threw down before a
tiger the boys who killed her young ones, and when she had thus brought
about their death, she made off." The Master came and inquired what it
was the Brethren were discussing and said, "Not now only, Brethren, but
formerly also did she bring about the death of those who killed her
young ones." And herewith he related a legend of the past.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time the Bodhisatta at Benares ruled his kingdom with
justice and equity. A certain heron in his house carried messages for
him. And so on just as before. But the special point here is that in
this case the bird, having let the tiger kill the boys, thought, "I can
no longer remain here. I will take my departure, but though I am going
away I will not leave without telling the king, but as soon as I have
told him I will be off." And so she drew nigh and saluted the king, and
standing a little way off said, "My lord, it was through your
carelessness that the boys killed my young ones, and under the influence
of passion I in revenge caused their death. Now I can no longer live
here." And uttering the first stanza she said:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Long I held this house as mine,  
    Honour great I did receive,  
It is due to act of thine  
    I am now compelled to leave.

</div>

The king on hearing this repeated the second stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Should one to retaliate,  
    Wrong with equal wrong repay,  
Then his anger should abate;  
    So, good heron, prithee stay.

</div>

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

\[136\] Hearing this the bird spoke the third stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Wronged can with wrong-doer ne’er  
    As of old be made at one:  
Nought, O king, can keep me here,  
    Lo! from henceforth I am gone.

</div>

The king, on hearing this, spoke the fourth stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Should they wise, not foolish be,  
    With the wronged wrong-doer may  
Live in peace and harmony:  
    So, good heron, prithee, stay.

</div>

The bird said, "As things are, I cannot stay, my lord," and saluting the
king she flew up into the air and made straight for the Himālayas.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Master, his lesson ended, thus identified the Birth: "The heron in
the former tale was the heron in this, but the king of Benares was
myself."
