*"Our old friend," etc.*—The Master told this tale while dwelling in
Jetavana, concerning a greedy Brother. The occasion is as above.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta was a pigeon and lived in a nest-basket in the kitchen of a

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Benares merchant.
A crow became intimate with him and lived there also. Here the story is
to be expanded. The cook pulled out the crow's feathers and sprinkled
him with flour, then piercing a cowrie he hung it on the crow's neck and
threw him into a basket. The Bodhisatta came from the wood, and seeing
him made a jest and spoke the first stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Our old friend! look at him!  
    A jewel bright he wears;  
His beard in gallant trim,  
    How gay our friend appears!

</div>

\[315\] The crow hearing him spoke the second stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

My nails and hair had grown so fast,  
    They hampered me in all I did:  
A barber came along at last,  
    And of superfluous hair I'm rid.

</div>

Then the Bodhisatta spoke the third stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Granted you got a barber then,  
    Who has cropped your hair so well:  
Round your neck, will you explain,  
    What's that tinkling like a bell?

</div>

Then the crow uttered two stanzas:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Men of fashion wear a gem  
    Round the neck: it's often done:  
I am imitating them:  
    Don't suppose it's just for fun.

</div>

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

If you're really envious  
    Of my beard that's trimmed so true:  
I can get you barbered thus;  
    You may have the jewel too.

</div>

The Bodhisatta hearing him spoke the sixth stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Nay, ’tis you they best become,  
    Gem and beard that's trimmed so true.  
I find your presence troublesome:  
    I go with a good-day to you.

</div>

\[316\] With these words he flew up and went elsewhere; and the crow
died then and there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the lesson, the Master declared the Truths and identified the
Birth:—After the Truths, the greedy Brother was established in the
fruition of the Third Path: "At that time the crow was the greedy
Brother, the pigeon was myself."
