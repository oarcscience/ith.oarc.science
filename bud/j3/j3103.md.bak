*"Thou art confused," etc.*—The Master told this when staying in
Jetavana, concerning the Perfection of Wisdom. The occasion of the story

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time a king called Janaka was reigning in Benares. At that
time the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family, and they called his
name young Senaka. When he grew up he learned all the arts at Takkasilā,
and returning to Benares saw the king. The king set him in the place of
minister and gave him great glory. \[342\] He taught the king things
temporal and spiritual. Being a pleasant preacher of the law he
established the king in the five precepts, in alms-giving, in keeping
the fasts, in the ten ways of right action, and so established him in
the path of virtue. Throughout the kingdom it was as it were the time of
the appearing of the Buddhas. On the fortnightly fast the king, the
viceroys and others would all assemble and decorate the place of
meeting. The Bodhisatta taught the law in a decorated room in the middle
of a deer-skin-couch with the power of a Buddha, and his word was like
the preaching of Buddhas. Then a certain old brahmin begging for
money-alms got a thousand pieces, left them in a brahmin family and went
to seek alms again. When he had gone, that family spent all his pieces.
He came back and would have his pieces brought him. The brahmin, being
unable to give them to him, gave him his daughter to wife. The other
brahmin took her and made his dwelling in a brahmin village not far from
Benares. Because of her youth his wife was unsatisfied in desires and
sinned with another young brahmin. There are sixteen things that cannot
be satisfied: and what are these sixteen? The sea is not satisfied with
all rivers, nor

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

the fire with fuel, nor a king with his kingdom, nor a fool with sins,
nor a woman with three things, intercourse, adornment and child-bearing,
nor a brahmin with sacred texts, nor a sage with ecstatic meditation,
nor a sekha <span id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_128.md) with honour, nor one
free from desire with penance, nor the energetic man with energy, nor
the talker with talk, nor the politic man with the council, nor the
believer with serving the church, nor the liberal man with giving away,
nor the learned with hearing the law, nor the four congregations <span
id="fr_131"></span>[2](#fn_129.md) with seeing the Buddha. So this brahmin
woman \[343\], being unsatisfied with intercourse, wished to put her
husband away and do her sin with boldness. So one day in her evil
purpose she lay down. When he said, "How is it, wife?" she answered,
"Brahmin, I cannot do the work of your house, get me a maid." "Wife, I
have no money, what shall I give to get her?" "Seek for money by begging
for alms and so get her." "Then, wife, get ready something for my
journey." She filled a skin-bag with baked meal and unbaked meal, and
gave them to him. The brahmin, going through villages, towns and cities,
got seven hundred pieces, and thinking, "This money is enough to buy
slaves, male and female," he was returning to his own village: at a
certain place convenient for water he opened his sack, and eating some
meal he went down to drink water without tying the mouth. Then a black
snake in a hollow tree, smelling the meal, entered the bag and lay down
in a coil eating the meal. The brahmin came, and without looking inside
fastened the sack and putting it on his shoulder went his way. Then a
spirit living in a tree, sitting in a hollow of the trunk, said to him
on the way, "Brahmin, if you stop on the way you will die, if you go
home to-day your wife will die," and vanished. He looked, but not seeing
the spirit was afraid and troubled with the fear of death, and so came
to the gate of Benares weeping and lamenting. It was the fast on the
fifteenth day, the day of the Bodhisatta's preaching, seated on the
decorated seat of the law, and a multitude with perfumes and flowers and
the like in their hands came in troops to hear the preaching. The
brahmin said, "Where are ye going?" and was told, "O brahmin, to-day
wise Senaka preaches the law with sweet voice and the power of a Buddha:
do you not know?" He thought, "They say he is a wise preacher, and I am
troubled with the fear of death: wise men \[344\] are able to take away
even great sorrow: it is right for me too to go there and hear the law."
So he went with them, and when the assembly and the king among them had
sat down round about the Bodhisatta, he stood at the outside, not far
from the seat of the law, with his mealsack on his shoulder, afraid with
the fear of death. The Bodhisatta preached as if he were bringing down
the river of heaven or showering ambrosia. The multitude became well
pleased, and making applause listened to the

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

preaching. Wise men have far sight. At that moment the Bodhisatta,
opening his eyes gracious with the five graces, surveyed the assembly on
every side and, seeing that brahmin, thought, "This great assembly has
become well pleased and listens to the law, making applause, but that
one brahmin is ill pleased and weeps: there must be some sorrow within
him to cause his tears: as if touching rust with acid, or making a drop
of water roll from a lotus leaf, I will teach him the law, making him
free from sorrow and well pleased in mind." So he called him, "Brahmin,
I am wise Senaka, now will I make thee free from sorrow, speak boldly,"
and so talking with him he spoke the first stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Thou art confused in thought, disturbed in sense,  
Tears streaming from thine eyes are evidence;  
What hast thou lost, or what dost wish to gain  
By coming hither? Give me answer plain.

</div>

\[345\] Then the brahmin, declaring his cause of sorrow, spoke the
second stanza:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

If I go home my wife it is must die,  
If I go not, the yakkha said, ’tis I;  
That is the thought that pierces cruelly:  
Explain the matter, Senaka, to me.

</div>

The Bodhisatta, hearing the brahmin's words, spread the net of knowledge
as if throwing a net in the sea, thinking, "There are many causes of
death to beings in this world: some die sunk in the sea, or seized
therein by ravenous fish, some falling in the Ganges, or seized by
crocodiles, some falling from a tree or pierced by a thorn, some struck
by weapons of divers kinds, some by eating poison or hanging or falling
from a precipice or by extreme cold or attacked by diseases of divers
kinds, so they die: now among so many causes of death from which cause
shall this brahmin die if he stays on the road to-day, or his wife if he
goes home?" As he considered, he saw the sack on the brahmin's shoulder
and thought, "There must be a snake who has gone into that sack, and
entering he must have gone in from the smell of the meal when the
brahmin at his breakfast had eaten some meal and gone to drink water
without fastening the sack's mouth: the brahmin coming back after
drinking water must have gone on after fastening and taking up the sack
without seeing that the snake had entered: \[346\] if he stays on the
road, he will say at evening when he rests, "I will eat some meal," and
opening the sack will put in his hand: then the snake will bite him in
the hand and destroy his life: this will be the cause of his death if he
stays on the road: but if he goes home the sack will come into his
wife's hand; she will say, "I will look at the ware within," and opening
the sack put in her hand, then the snake will bite her and destroy her
life, and this will be the cause of her death if he goes home to-day."
This he knew by his knowledge of expedients. Then this

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

came into his mind, "The snake must be a black snake, brave and
fearless; when the sack strikes against the brahmin's broadside, he
shows no motion or quivering; he shows no sign of his being there amidst
such an assembly: therefore he must be a black snake, brave and
fearless:" from his knowledge of expedients he knew this as if he was
seeing with a divine eye. So as if he had been a man who had stood by
and seen the snake enter the sack, deciding by his knowledge of
expedients, the Bodhisatta answering the brahmin's question in the royal
assembly spoke the third stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

First with many a doubt I deal,  
    Now my tongue the truth declares;  
Brahmin, in your bag of meal  
    A snake has entered unawares.

</div>

\[347\] So saying, he asked, "O brahmin, is there any meal in that sack
of yours?" "There is, O sage." "Did you eat some meal to-day at your
breakfast time?" "Yes, O sage." "Where were you sitting?" "In a wood, at
the root of a tree." "When you ate the meal, and went to drink water,
did you fasten the sack's mouth or not?" "I did not, O sage." "When you
drank water and came back, did you fasten the sack after looking in?" "I
fastened it without looking in, O sage." "O brahmin, when you went to
drink water, I think the snake entered the sack owing to the smell of
the meal without your knowledge: such is the case: therefore put down
your sack, set it in the midst of the assembly and opening the mouth,
stand back and taking a stick beat the sack with it: then when you see a
black snake coming out with its hood spread and hissing, you will have
no doubt:" so he spoke the fourth stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Take a stick and beat the sack,  
    Dumb and double-tongued is he;  
Cease your mind with doubts to rack;  
   Ope the sack, the snake you'll see.

</div>

The brahmin, hearing the Great Being's words, did so, though alarmed and
frightened. The snake came out of the sack when his hood was struck with
the stick, and stood looking at the crowd.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\[348\] The Master, explaining the matter, spoke the fifth stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Frightened, ’midst the assembled rout,  
    String of meal-sack he untied;  
Angry crept a serpent out,  
    Hood erect, in all his pride.

</div>

When the snake came out with hood erect, there was a forecast of the
Bodhisatta as the omniscient Buddha. The multitude began waving cloths
and snapping fingers in thousands, the showers of the seven precious
stones were as showers from a thick cloud, cries of "good" were raised
in hundreds of thousands,

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

and the noise was like the splitting of the earth. This answering of
such a question with the power of a Buddha is not the power of birth,
nor the power of men rich in gifts and high family: of what is it the
power then? Of knowledge: the man of knowledge makes spiritual insight
to increase, opens the door of the noble Paths, enters the great and
endless nirvāna and masters the perfection of disciple-hood,
pacceka-buddha-hood, and perfect buddha-hood: knowledge is the best
among the qualities that bring the great and endless nirvana, the rest
are the attendants of knowledge: and so it is said:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Wisdom is best," the good confess,  
    Like the moon in starry skies;  
Virtue, fortune, righteousness,  
    Are the handmaids of the wise.

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the question had been so answered by the Bodhisatta, a certain
snake-charmer made a mouth-band for the snake, caught him and let him
loose in the forest. The brahmin, coming up to the king, saluted him and
made obeisance, and praising him spoke half a stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Great, king Janaka, thy gain,  
Seeing Senaka the wise.

</div>

\[349\] After praising the king, he took seven hundred pieces from the
bag and praising the Bodhisatta, he spoke a stanza and a half wishing to
give a gift in delight:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Dread thy wisdom; veils are vain,  
Brahmin, to thy piercing eyes.

These seven hundred pieces, see,  
Take them all, I give them thee;  
’Tis to thee I owe my life,  
And the welfare of my wife.

</div>

Hearing this, the Bodhisatta spoke the eighth stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

For reciting poetry  
    Wise men can't accept a wage;  
Rather let us give to thee,  
    Ere thou take the homeward stage.

</div>

So saying, the Bodhisatta made a full thousand pieces to be given to the
brahmin, and asked him, "By whom were you sent to beg for money?" "By my
wife, O sage." \[350\] "Is your wife old or young?" "Young, O sage."
"Then she is doing sin with another, and sent you away thinking to do so
in security: if you take these pieces home, she will give to her lover
the pieces won by your labour: therefore you should not go home
straight, but only after leaving the pieces outside the town at the root
of a tree or somewhere:" so he sent him away. He, coming near the
village, left his pieces at the root of a tree, and came home in the
evening. His wife at that moment was seated with her lover. The brahmin
stood at the door and said, "Wife." She recognise his voice, and putting
out the light

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

opened the door: when the brahmin came in, she took the other and put
him at the door: then coming back and not seeing anything in the sack
she asked, "Brahmin, what alms have you got on your journey?" "A
thousand pieces." "Where is it?" "It is left at such and such a place:
never mind, we will get it to-morrow." She went and told her lover. He
went and took it as if it were his own treasure. Next day the brahmin
went, and not seeing the pieces came to the Bodhisatta, who said, "What
is the matter, brahmin?" "I don't see the pieces, O sage." "Did you tell
your wife?" "Yes, O sage." Knowing that the wife had told her lover, the
Bodhisatta asked, "Brahmin, is there a brahmin who is a friend of your
wife's?" "There is, O sage." "Is there one who is a friend of yours?"
"Yes, O sage." Then the Great Being caused seven days' expenses to be
given him and said, "Go, do you two invite and entertain the first day
fourteen brahmins, seven for yourself and seven for your wife: from next
day onwards take one less each day, till on the seventh day you invite
one brahmin and your wife one: then if you notice that the brahmin your
wife asks on the seventh day has come every time, tell me." \[351\] The
brahmin did so, and told the Bodhisatta, "O sage, I have observed the
brahmin who is always our guest." The Bodhisatta sent men with him to
bring that other brahmin, and asked him, "Did you take a thousand pieces
belonging to this brahmin from the root of such and such a tree?" "I did
not, O sage." "You do not know that I am the wise Senaka; I will make
you fetch those pieces." He was afraid and confessed, saying, "I took
them." "What did you do?" "I put them in such and such a place, O sage."
The Bodhisatta asked the first brahmin, "Brahmin, will you keep your
wife or take another?" "Let me keep her, O sage." The Bodhisatta sent
men to fetch the pieces and the wife, and gave the brahmin the pieces
from the thief's hand; he punished the other, removing him from the
city, punished also the wife, and gave great honour to the brahmin,
making him dwell near himself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the lesson, the Master declared the Truths, and identified the
Birth:—At the end of the Truths, many attained the fruition of the First
Path:—"At that time the brahmin was Ānanda, the spirit Sāriputta, the
assembly was the church of Buddha, and wise Senaka was myself."
