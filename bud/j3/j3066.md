*"Lo! here we lie," etc.*—This story the Master, whilst living at
Jetavana, told concerning an aged priest. The story has been already
related in full in the Sālaka Birth. <span id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_77.md)
In this version also the old man after ordaining a village lad abuses
and strikes him. The lad escaped and returned to the world. \[198\] The
old man once more admitted him to orders, and acted just as before. The
youth, after he had for the third time returned to the world, on being
again solicited to come back, would not so much as look the old man in
the face. The matter was talked over in the Hall of Truth, how that a
certain elder could live neither with his novice nor without him, while
the boy after seeing the old man's fault of temper, being a sensitive
youth, would not even look at him. The Master came

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

and asked what was the subject of discussion. When they told him, he
said, "Not now only, Brethren, but formerly also this same youth was a
sensitive novice, who after observing the elder's faults would not so
much as look at him." And so saying he told a story of the past.

Once upon a time in the reign of Brahmadatta, king of Benares, the
Bodhisatta was born in a corn-factor's family. And when he was grown up,
he got his living by selling corn.

Now a certain snake-charmer caught a monkey and trained him to play with
a snake. And when a festival was proclaimed at Benares, he left the
monkey with the corn-merchant and roamed about for seven days, making
sport with the snake. The merchant meanwhile fed the monkey with food
both hard and soft. On the seventh day the snake-charmer got drunk at
the festival merry-making, and came back and struck the monkey three
times with a piece of bamboo, and then taking him with him to a garden,
he tied him up and fell asleep. The monkey got loose from his chain, and
climbing up a mango tree, sat there eating the fruit. The snake-charmer
on waking up saw the monkey perched on the tree and thought, "I must
catch him by wheedling him." And in talking with him he repeated the
first stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Lo! here we lie, my pretty one,  
Like gambler by the dice undone.  
Let fall some mangoes: well we know,  
Our living to thy tricks we owe.

</div>

The monkey, on hearing this, uttered the remaining verses:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Thy praises, friend, unmeaning sound;  
A pretty monkey ne’er was found.  
\[199\] Who in the stores, when drunk, I pray,  
Did starve and beat me sore to-day?  
When I, snake-charmer, call to mind  
The bed of pain where I reclined,  
Though I should some day be a king,  
No prayer from me this boon should wring,  
Thy cruelty remembering.  
But if a man is known to live  
Content at home, is apt to give,  
And springs of gentle race, the wise  
With such should form the closest ties.

</div>

With these words the monkey was lost in a crowd of fellow-monkeys. <span

The Master here ended his lesson and identified the Birth: "At that time
the old man was the snake-charmer, the novice was the monkey, and I
myself was the corn-merchant."
