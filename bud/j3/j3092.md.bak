*"Noble of face," etc.*—The Master told this while dwelling in Jetavana,
concerning his going about for the whole world's good. The occasion will
appear in the Mahākaṇha Birth. <span id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_117.md)
Then the Master said, "Brethren, this is not the first time the
Tathāgata has gone about for the world's good," and so told an old tale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta
was Sakka. At that time a wizard, using his magic, came at midnight and
corrupted the chief queen of Benares. Her handmaids knew of this. She
herself went to the king and said, "Your majesty, some man enters the
royal chamber at midnight and corrupts me." "Could you make any mark on
him?" "I can." So she got a bowl of real vermilion, and when the man
came at night and was going away after enjoyment, she set the mark of
her five fingers on his back and in the morning told the king. The king
gave orders to his men to go and looking everywhere bring a man with a
vermilion mark on his back.

Now the wizard after his misconduct at night stands by day in a cemetery
on one foot worshipping the sun. The king's men saw him and surrounded
him: but he, thinking that his action had become known to them, \[304\]
used his magic and flew away in the air. The king asked his men when
they came back from seeing this, "Did you see him?" "Yes, we saw him."
"Who is he?" "A Brother, your majesty." For after his misconduct at
night he lived by day in disguise of a Brother. The king thought, "These
men go about by day in ascetic's garb and misconduct themselves at
night;" so being angry with the Brethren, he adopted heretical views,
and sent round a proclamation by drum that all the Brethren must depart
from his kingdom and that his men would punish them wherever found. All
the ascetics fled from the kingdom of Kāsi, which was three hundred
leagues in extent, to other royal cities, and there was no one,
righteous Buddhist or Brahmin, to preach to the men of all Kāsi; so that
the men without preaching became savage, and being averse to charity and
the commandments were born in a state of punishment for the most part as
they died, and never got birth in heaven. Sakka, not

seeing any new gods, reflected on what the reason might be, and saw that
it was the expulsion of the Brethren from the kingdom by the king of
Benares owing to his adopting heretical views in anger about the wizard:
then he thought, "Except myself there is no one who can destroy this
king's heresy; I will be the helper of the king and his subjects," so he
went to the paccekabuddhas in the Nandamūla cave and said, "Sirs, give
me an old paccekabuddha, I wish to convert the kingdom of Kāsi." He got
the senior among them. When he took his bowl and robes Sakka set him
before and came himself after, making respectful salutation and
venerating the paccekabuddha: himself becoming a beautiful young Brother
he went thrice round the whole city from end to end, and then coming to
the king's gate he stood in the air. They told the king, "Your majesty,
there is a beautiful young Brother with a priest standing in the air
\[305\] at the king's gate." The king rose from his seat and standing at
the lattice said, "Young Brother, why do you, who are beautiful, stand
venerating that ugly priest and holding his bowl and robes?" and so
talking with him he spoke the first stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Noble of face, you make obeisance low;  
Behind one mean and poor to sight you go:  
Is he your better or your equal, say,  
Declare to us your name and his, we pray.

</div>

The Sakka answered, "Great king, priests are in the place of
teacher <span id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_118.md); therefore it is not right
that I should utter his name: but I will tell you my own name," so he
spoke the second stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Gods do not tell the lineage and the name  
    Of saints devout and perfect in the way:  
As for myself, my title I proclaim,  
    Sakka, the lord whom thirty gods obey.

</div>

The king hearing this asked in the third stanza what was the blessing of
venerating the Brother:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

He who beholds the saint of perfect merits,  
    And walks behind him with obeisance low:  
\[306\] I ask, O king of gods, what he inherits,  
    What blessings will another life bestow?

</div>

Sakka replied in the fourth stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

He who beholds the saint of perfect merits,  
    Who walks behind him with obeisance low:  
Great praise from men in this world he inherits,  
    And death to him the path of heaven will show.

</div>

The king hearing Sakka's words gave up his own heretical views, and in
delight spoke the fifth stanza:—

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Oh, fortune's sun on me to-day doth rise,  
    Our eyes have seen thy majesty divine:  
Thy saint appears, O Sakka, to our eyes,  
    And many a virtuous deed will now be mine.

</div>

Sakka, hearing him praising his master, spoke the sixth stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Surely ’tis good to venerate the wise,  
    To knowledge who their learned thoughts incline:  
Now that the saint and I have met thine eyes,  
    O king, let many a virtuous deed be thine.

</div>

\[301\] Hearing this the king spoke the last stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

From anger free, with grace in every thought,  
    I'll lend an ear whenever strangers sue:  
I take thy counsel good, I bring to nought  
    My pride and serve thee, Lord, with homage due.

</div>

Having said so he came down from the terrace, saluted the paccekabuddha
and stood on one side. The paccekabuddha sat cross-legged in the air and
said, "Great king, that wizard was no Brother: henceforward recognise
that the world is not vanity, that there are good Buddhists and
Brahmins, and so give gifts, practise morality, keep the holy-days,"
preaching to the king. Sakka also by his power stood in the air, and
preaching to the townsfolk, "Henceforward be zealous," he sent round
proclamation by drum that the Buddhists and Brahmins who had fled should
return. Then both went back to their own place. The king stood firm in
the admonition and did good works.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the lesson, the Master declared the Truths and identified the
Birth:—"At that time the paccekabuddha reached Nirvāna, the king was
Ānanda, Sakka was myself."
