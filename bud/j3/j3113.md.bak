*"I bore with me," etc.*—The Master told this tale while dwelling in
Jetavana, concerning rebuke of sin. The incident leading to the tale
will appear in the Paññā <span id="fr_151"></span>[2](#fn_149.md) Birth. On
this occasion the Master, perceiving that five hundred Brethren were
overcome by thoughts of desire in the House of the Golden Pavement,

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

gathered the assembly and said, "Brethren, it is right to distrust where
distrust is proper; sins surround a man as banyans and such plants grow
up around a tree: in this way of old a spirit dwelling in the top of a
cotton-tree saw a bird voiding the banyan seeds it had eaten among the
branches of the cotton-tree, and became terrified lest her abode should
thereby come to destruction:" and so he told a tale of old.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta was a tree-spirit dwelling in the top of a cotton-tree. A
king of the rocs assumed a shape a hundred and fifty leagues in extent,
and dividing the water in the great ocean by the blast of his wings, he
seized by the tail a king of snakes a thousand fathoms long, and making
the snake disgorge what he had seized in his mouth, he flew along the
tree tops towards the cotton-tree. The snake-king thought, "I will make
him drop me and let me go," so he stuck his hood into a banyan-tree and
wound himself round it firmly. Owing to the roe-king's strength and the
great size of the snake-king the banyan was uprooted. But the snake-king
would not let go the banyan. The roc-king took the snake-king,
banyan-tree and all, to the cotton-tree, laid him on the trunk, opened
his belly \[398\] and ate the fat. Then he threw the rest of the carcase
into the sea. Now in that banyan there was a certain bird, who flew up
when the banyan was thrown away, and perched in one of the boughs high
on the cotton-tree. The tree-spirit seeing the bird shook and trembled
with fear, thinking, "This bird will let its droppings fall on my trunk;
a growth of banyan or of fig will arise and go spreading all over my
tree: so my home will be destroyed." The tree shook to the roots with
the trembling of the spirit. The roc-king perceived the trembling, and
spoke two stanzas in enquiry as to the reason:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I bore with me the thousand fathoms length of that king-snake:  
His size and my huge bulk you bore and yet you did not quake.

But now this tiny bird you bear, so small compared to me:  
You shake with fear and tremble; but wherefore, cotton-tree?

</div>

Then the deity spoke four stanzas in explanation of the reason:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Flesh is thy food, O king: the bird's is fruit:  
Seeds of the banyan and the fig he'll shoot  
And bo-tree too, and all my trunk pollute;

They will grow trees in shelter of my stem,  
And I shall be no tree, thus hid by them.

</div>

\[399\] <span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Other trees, once strong of root and rich in branches, plainly show  
How the seeds that birds do carry in destruction lay them low.

Parasitic growths will bury e’en the mighty forest tree:  
This is why, O king, I quiver when the fear to come I see.

</div>

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

Hearing the tree-spirit's words, the roc-king spoke the final stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Fear is right if things are fearful: ’gainst the coming danger guard:  
Wise men look on both worlds calmly if they present fears discard.

</div>

So speaking, the roc-king by his power drove the bird away from that
tree.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the lesson, the Master declared the Truths, beginning with the
words: "It is right to distrust where distrust is proper," and
identified the Birth:—after the Truths \[400\] five hundred Brethren
were established in Sainthood:—"At that time Sāriputta was the roc-king
and I myself the tree-spirit."
