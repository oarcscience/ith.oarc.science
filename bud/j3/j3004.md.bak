*"O monarch that erst," etc.—*This story the Master told while dwelling
at Jetavana, about a courtier of the king of Kosala. The circumstances
that suggested the story have been already related in the Seyyaṃsa <span
id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md) Birth. On this occasion the Master said,
"You are not the only one who got good out of evil: wise men of old also
got good out of evil." And he told an old-world story.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time a minister in attendance on the king of Benares
misconducted himself in the royal harem. The king after witnessing his
offence with his own eyes banished him from the kingdom. How he took
service with the king of Kosala, named Dabbasena, is all told in the
Mahāsīlava <span id="fr_5"></span>[2](#fn_5.md) Birth.

But in the present story Dabbasena had the king of Benares seized while
sitting on the dais in the midst of his councillors, and fastening him
by a cord on the lintel of the door suspended him head downwards. The
king cultivated feelings of charity towards the rebel prince, and by a
process of complete absorption entered upon a state of mystic
meditation, and bursting his bonds sat cross-legged in the air. The
rebel prince was attacked with a burning pain in the body, and with a
cry of "I burn, I burn" he rolled over and over on the ground. When he
asked the reason of it, his courtiers replied, "It is because the king
whom you suspend head downwards from the lintel of the door is such an
innocent and holy man." Then said he, "Go quickly and release him." His
servants went and found the king sitting cross-legged in the air, and
came back and told Dabbasena. \[14\] So he went with all speed, and
bowing before him asked his pardon and repeated the first stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

O monarch that erst in thy kingdom didst dwell,  
    Enjoying such bliss as few mortals have seen,  
How is it that lying midst tortures of Hell  
    Thou still art so calm and so gracious of mien?

</div>

On hearing this the Bodhisatta repeated the rest of the stanzas:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Of yore ’twas my one earnest prayer unto Heaven  
From the ranks of ascetics no more to be barred,  
But now that such glory to me has been given,  
O why should the form of my visage be marred?

</div>

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The end is accomplished, my task is now done,  
    The prince once my foe is no longer estranged,  
But now that the fame I so envied is won,  
   O why should the form of my visage be changed?

 <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](j3005.htm#fn_6.md)When joy turns to sorrow, and
weal becomes woe,  
    Patient souls even pleasure may wring from their pain,  
But no such distinction of feeling they know,  
    When the calm of Nirvāna poor mortals attain.

</div>

\[15\] On hearing this Dabbasena asked forgiveness of the Bodhisatta and
said, "Rule over your own people and I will drive out the rebels from
amongst you." And after punishing that wicked councillor he went his
way. But the Bodhisatta handed over the kingdom to his ministers, and
adopting the ascetic life of a Rishi he became destined to birth in the
Brahma-world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the Master had finished this discourse, he identified the Birth:
"At that time Ānanda was Dabbasena, and I myself was the king of
Benares."
