\[483\] *"Formed of rough logs;" etc.*—This story the Master told at
Jetavana concerning a, disobedient Brother. He was, they say, of gentle
birth, and though ordained in the doctrine that leads to Salvation, was
admonished by his well-wishers, masters, teachers, and fellow-students
to this effect: "Thus must you advance and thus retreat; thus look at or
away from objects; thus must the arm be stretched out or drawn back;
thus are the inner and outer garment to be worn; thus is the bowl to be
held, and when you have received sufficient food to sustain life, after
self-examination, thus are you to partake of it, keeping guard over the
door of the senses; in eating you are to be moderate and exercise
watchfulness; you are to recognize such and such duties towards Brethren
who come to or go from the monastery; these are the fourteen <span
id="fr_174"></span>[2](#fn_172) sets of priestly duties, and the eighty
great duties to duly performed; these are the thirteen <span
id="fr_175"></span>[3](#fn_173) Dhuta practices; all these are to be
scrupulously performed." Yet was he disobedient and impatient, and did
not receive instruction respectfully, but refused to listen to them,
saying, "I do not find fault with you. Why do you speak thus to me? I
shall know what is for my good, and what is not." Then the Brethren,
hearing of his disobedience, sat in the Hall of Truth, telling of his
faults. The Master came and asked them what it was they were discussing,
and sent for the Brother and said, "Is it true, Brother, that you are
disobedient?" And when he confessed that it was so, the Master said,
"Why, Brother, after being ordained in so excellent a doctrine that
leads to Salvation, \[484\] do you not listen to the voice of your
well-wishers? Formerly too you disobeyed the voice of the wise, and were
blown into atoms by the Veramba wind." And herewith he told a story of
the past.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time the Bodhisatta came to life as a young vulture on
Vulture Mountain. Now his offspring Supatta, the king of the vultures,

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

was strong and lusty and had a following of many thousands of vultures,
and he fed the parent birds. And owing to his strength he used to fly to
a very great distance. So his father admonished him and said, "My son,
you must not go beyond such and such a point." He said, "Very good," but
one day when it rained, he flew up with the other vultures, and leaving
the rest behind, and going beyond the prescribed limit, he came within
the range of the Veramba wind, and was blown into atoms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Master, in his Perfect Wisdom, to illustrate this incident, uttered
these verses:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Formed of rough logs, an ancient pathway led  
To dizzy heights, where a young vulture fed  
The parent birds. Lusty and strong of wing  
He oft to them would fat of serpents bring;  
And when his father saw him flying high  
And venturing far afield, he thus would cry,  
"My son, when thou canst scan from thy look out  
Earth's rounded sphere by ocean girt about,  
No farther go, but straight return, I pray."  
Then would this king of birds speed on his way,  
And bending o’er the earth, with piercing sight  
He viewed below forest and mountain height:  
And earth would, as his sire described, appear  
Amid the encircling sea a rounded sphere.  
But when beyond these limits he had passed,  
Strong bird though he might be, a raging blast  
Swept him away to an untimely death,  
Powerless to cope with storm-wind's fiery breath.  
\[485\] Thus did the bird by disobedience prove  
Fatal to those dependent on his love:  
So perish all that scornful of old age  
Deride the warnings uttered by the sage,  
As the young vulture Wisdom's voice defied  
And scorned the limits set to bound his pride.

\[486\] " Therefore, Brother, be not like unto this vulture, but do the
bidding of your well-wishers." And being thus admonished by the Master,
he thenceforth became obedient.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Master, his lesson ended, identified the Birth: "The disobedient
vulture of those days is now the disobedient Brother. The parent vulture
was myself."
