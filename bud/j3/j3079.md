#### DARĪMUKHA-JĀTAKA.

\[238\] *"Pleasures of sense," etc.*—This tale was told by the Master
while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning the Great Renunciation. The
incident that led to the story has been told before.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time the Magadha king reigned in Rājagaha. The Bodhisatta
was born of his chief queen, and they called him prince Brahmadatta. On
the day of his birth, the family priest also had a son: his face was
very beautiful, so they called him Darīmukha <span
id="fr_97"></span>[2](#fn_95). Both grew up in the king's court dear
friends together, and in the sixteenth year they went to Takkasilā and
learned all the arts. Then, meaning to acquire all practical usages and
understand country observances, they wandered through towns, villages
and all the land. So they reached Benares, and staying in a temple they
went into the city next day to beg. In one of the houses in the city the
people of the house had cooked rice-porridge and prepared seats to feed
brahmins and give them portions. These people seeing the two youths
begging, thought, "The brahmins have come," and making them come in laid
a white cloth on the Bodhisatta's seat and a red rug on Darīmukha's.
Darīmukha observed the omen and understood that his friend should be
king in Benares and himself commander of the army. They ate and took
their portions, and then with a blessing left and went to the king's
garden. The Bodhisatta lay on the royal stone-seat. Darīmukha sat
stroking his feet. The king of Benares had been dead seven days. The
family priest had performed funeral rites and sent out the

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

festal car for seven days as there was no heir to the throne. This
ceremony of the car will be explained in the Mahājanaka Birth. This car
left the city and reached the gate of the garden, \[239\] accompanied by
an army of the four divisions and by the music of hundreds of
instruments. Darīmukha, hearing the music, thought, "This car is coming
for my friend, he will be king to-day and give me the commander's place,
but why should I be a layman? I will go away and become an ascetic"; so
without a word to the Bodhisatta he went on one side and stood
concealed. The priest stayed the car at the gate of the garden, and
entering saw the Bodhisatta lying on the royal seat: observing the
auspicious marks on his feet, he thought, "He has merit and is worthy to
be king even of the four continents with two thousand islands around
them, but what is his courage?" So he made all the instruments sound
their loudest. The Bodhisatta woke and taking the cloth from his face he
saw the multitude: then covering his face again he lay down for a
little, and rising when the car stopped sat cross-legged on the seat.
The priest resting on his knee said, "Lord, the kingdom falls to you."
"Why, is there no heir?" "No, lord." "Then it is well," and so he
accepted, and they anointed him there in the garden. In his great glory
he forgot Darīmukha. He mounted the car and drove amid the multitude in
solemn form round the city: then stopping at the palace-gate he arranged
the places of the courtiers and went up to the terrace. At that instant
Darīmukha seeing the garden now empty came and sat on the royal seat in
the garden. A withered leaf fell before him. In it he came to see the
principles of decay and death, grasped the three marks of things, and
making the earth re-echo with joy he entered on *paccekabodhi.* At that
instant the characters of a householder vanished from him, a miraculous
bowl and frock fell from the sky and clave to his body, at once he had
the eight requisites and the perfect deportment of a centenarian monk,
\[240\] and by miracle he flew into the air and went to the cave
Nandamūla <span id="fr_98"></span>[1](#fn_96) in the Himālaya.

The Bodhisatta ruled his kingdom with righteousness, but the greatness
of his glory infatuated him and for forty years he forgot Darīmukha. In
the fortieth year he remembered him, and saying, "I have a friend named
Darīmukha; where is he now?" he longed to see him. Thenceforth even in
the seraglio and in the assembly he would say, "Where is my friend
Darīmukha? I will give great honour to the man who tells me of his
abode." Another ten years passed while he remembered Darīmukha from time
to time. Darīmukha, though now a paccekabuddha, after fifty years
reflected and knew that his friend remembered him: and thinking, "He is
now old and increased with sons and daughters, I will go and preach the
law to him and ordain him," he went by miracle through

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

the air, and lighting in the garden he sat like a golden image on the
stone seat. The gardener seeing him came up and asked, "Sir, whence come
you?" "From the cave Nandamūlaka." "Who are you?" "Friend, I am
Darīmukha the pacceka." "Sir, do you know our king?" "Yes, he was my
friend in my layman days." "Sir, the king longs to see you, I will tell
him of your coming." "Go and do so." He went and told the king that
Darīmukha was come and sitting on the stone-seat. The king said, "So my
friend is come, I shall see him ": so he mounted his car and with a
great retinue went to the garden and saluting the paccekabuddha with
kindly greeting he sat on one side. The paccekabuddha said,
"Brahmadatta, do you rule your kingdom with righteousness, never follow
evil courses or oppress the people for money, and do good deeds with
charity?" \[241\] and after kindly greeting, "Brahmadatta, you are old,
it is time for you to renounce pleasures, and be ordained," so he
preached the law and spoke the first stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Pleasures of sense are but morass and mire:  
    The "triply-rooted terror" them I call.  
Vapour and dust I have proclaimed them, Sire:  
    Become a Brother and forsake them all.

</div>

\[242\] Hearing this, the king explaining that he was bound by desires
spoke the second stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Infatuate, bound and deeply stained am I,  
    Brahmin, with pleasures: fearful they may be,  
But I love life, and cannot them deny:  
    Good works I undertake continually.

</div>

\[243\] Then Darīmukha though the Bodhisatta said, "I cannot be
ordained," did not reject him and exhorted him yet again:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

He who rejects the counsel of his friend,  
    Who pities him, and would avert his doom,  
Thinking "this world is better," finds no end,  
    Foolish, of long rebirths within the womb.

That fearful place of punishment is his,  
    Full of all filth, held evil by the good:  
The greedy their desires can ne’er dismiss,  
    The flesh imprisons all the carnal brood.

</div>

\[244\] So Darīmukha the paccekabuddha showing the misery rising from
conception and quickening, to show next the misery of birth spoke a
stanza and a half:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Covered with blood and with gross foulness stained,  
    All mortal beings issue from the birth:  
Whate’er they touch thereafter is ordained  
    To bring them pain and sorrow on the earth.

I speak what I have seen, not what I hear  
    From others: I remember times of old.

</div>

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

\[245\] Now the Master in his Perfect Wisdom said, "So the paccekabuddha
helped the king with good words," and at the end spoke the remaining
half-stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Darīmukha did to Sumedha's <span id="fr_99"></span>[1](j3080.htm#fn_97)
ear  
    Wisdom in many a stanza sweet unfold.

</div>

The paccekabuddha, showing the misery of desires, making his words
understood, said, "O king, be ordained or not, but anyhow I have told
the wretchedness of desires and the blessings of ordination, be thou
zealous," and so like a golden royal goose he rose in the air, and
treading on clouds he reached the Nandamūlaka cave. The Great Being made
on his head the salutations resplendent with the ten finger-nails put
together and bowing down stood till \[246\] Darīmukha passed out of
sight: then he sent for his eldest son and gave him the kingdom: and
leaving desires, while a great multitude was weeping and lamenting, he
went to the Himālaya and building a hut of leaves he was ordained as an
ascetic: then in no long time he gained the Faculties and Attainments
and at his life's end he went to Brahma's heaven.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The lesson ended, the Master declared the truths: then many attained the
First Path and the rest:—and he identified the Birth: "At that time the
king was myself."
