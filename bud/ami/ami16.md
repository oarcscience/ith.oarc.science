<span id="an_16">16</span> Compare Samuel Beal's Abstract of Form
Lectures on Buddhist literature in China, p. 177, where we read: "He who
is possessed of the highest self, he is able to see Buddha. Buddha,
although he dwell in the world, can be seen by none but those possessed
of this highest self. Mahârâja! Most true it is that though Buddha has
attained Nirvâna, yet may you behold him."

III, 15, 1231.

<span id="an_22">22</span> For the details of Açvaghosha's doctrine of
the triple aspect of the highest truth (so similar to the Christian
trinity) as the Kâya (i.e., body or personality) of (1) the good law,
(2) transformation, (3) bliss, see T. Suzuki's translation of
