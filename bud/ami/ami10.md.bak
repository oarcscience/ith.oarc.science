### AMITÂBHA.

<span class="smallcaps">One</span> evening when King Kanishka together
with his friend Charaka enjoyed the company of Açvaghosha, the youthful
ruler of Gandhâra turned to the venerable philosopher with this request:
"And now, worshipful master, tell us, do we worship in Buddha a god or a
man?"

Replied Açvaghosha: "Buddha is neither a god nor a man; he is more than
either, for he is perfection incarnate. We worship in Buddha wisdom and
goodness, that is, the comprehension and application of the truth, which
are the qualities that alone render the gods divine. Truth is eternal,
but all actual beings, not even excluding the gods, are transient."

Charaka interposed: "We do not speak of the gods, but of God, which
means divinity itself. What would the Buddha have taught about God?"

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

Kanishka added: "We mean God, not in the sense of Brahma, the principle
of existence, nor of Ishvara, a personal Lord and manufacturer of
universes, but God as goodness, as truth, as righteousness, as love?
Does God in this sense exist or not? Is it a dream or a reality? What is
it and how do we know of it?"

"You ask a question to answer which will take a book. But I shall be
brief. Certainly, God in this sense is a reality. God, in this sense is
the good law that shapes existence, leading life step by step onward and
upward toward its highest goal—enlightenment. Recognition of this law
gives us light on the conditions of our existence so as to render it
possible for us to find the right path; and we call it Dharmakaya, the
body of the good law, or Amitâbha, the source of infinite light, or by
some other name. It is the norm of all nature involving the bliss of
goodness and the curse of wrong doing according to irrefragable
causation."

"Accordingly, a man is not a Buddha by birth, but he can become a Buddha
by attaining to Buddhahood," said the king inquiringly.

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

"Exactly so," replied Açvaghosha. "The highest truth is not a
fabrication of the mind; the highest truth is
eternal.[15](ami16.htm#an_15.md) Shakyamuni attained to Buddhahood, and
there were many who saw him, yet they did not behold in him the Buddha;
while now, after he has entered into Paranirvana, there are many who
never saw him in the body, yet having attained faith may truly be said
to behold the Buddha, for the Buddha can be recognised with the mind's
eye alone."[16](ami16.htm#an_16.md)

"Then Amitâbha is the principle of being as much as Brahma?" enquired
Charaka.

"Brahma is a personification of the principle of being," replied
Açvaghosha, "but Amitâbha is the standard of being. Amitâbha is the
intrinsic law which, whenever being rises into existence, moulds life
and develops it, producing uniformities and regularities in both the
world of realities and the realm of thought. It is the source of
rationality and righteousness, of science and of morality, of philosophy
and religion. The sage of the Shakyas is one ray of its light only,
albeit for us the most powerful ray, with the clearest, brightest, and

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

purest light. He is the light that came to us here in this world and in
our country. Wheresoever wisdom appears, there is an incarnation, more
or less partial, more or less complete, of Amitâbha."

"But existence," rejoined Charaka, "is different from the good law.
Being is one thing and the norm that moulds it another. There is the
great question, whether or not life itself is wrong. If life is wrong,
the joy of living is sin, the enhancement of life, including its
reproduction, an error, and love, the love of husband and wife, becomes
a just cause for repentance."

"Mark the doctrine, noble youth, and act accordingly," replied
Açvaghosha. "I read in your eyes the secret of your heart which prompts
you to ask this question. Goodness is a reality which exists in both
existence and non-existence. Call it God or Amitâbha, or Allhood, or the
eternal and uncreated, the universal law, the not-bodily, the nothing or
nonexistence, for it is not concrete nor material, nor real to the
senses,—yet it exists, it is spiritual and can be discovered by the
mind; it is

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

and remains for all that exists the intrinsic and necessary norm; it is
the rule and regulation for both things and thoughts. It is omnipresent
in the universe, invisible, impalpable, as a perfume that permeates a
room. Whatever makes its appearance as a concrete reality is affected by
its savor and nothing can be withdrawn from its sway. It is not
existence itself, but the womb of existence; it is that which gives
definite shape to beings, moulding them and determining them according
to conditions. You have Amitâbha in two aspects as the formation of
particular existence and as the general law of universal types. The
particular is the realisation of the universal; and the universal
constitutes the type of the particular, giving it a definite character.
Neither is without the other. Mere particularity is being in a state of
ignorance; thus all life starts in ignorance; but mere universality is
existence unrealised; it is as though existence were not. Therefore
enjoyment of life is not wrong and the love of husband and wife is no
cause for repentance, if it be but the right love, true

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

and unfailing and making each willing to bear the burdens of the other.

"The Lord spoke not of God, because the good law that becomes incarnated
in Buddhahood is not a somebody, not an entity, not an ego, not even a
ghost. As there is not a ghost-soul, so there is not a ghost-God."

Said Charaka: "Now I understand the picture of the Lord Buddha with his
two attendants, Love as Particularity on the elephant and Wisdom as
Universality on the lion. Ananda, the disciple of loving service, and
Kâshyapa, the disciple of philosophical intellectuality, have approached
their master and grasped the significance of his doctrine from two
opposite and contrasting sides."

"Those who mortify their bodies," continued Açvaghosha, "have not
understood the doctrine. We are not ego-souls. For that reason the
thought of an individual escape, the salvation of our ego-soul, is a
heresy and an illusion. We all stand together and every man must work
for the salvation of mankind. Therefore I love to compare the doctrine
of the Buddha to a great ship or a grand vehicle

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> —a Mahâyâna—in
which there is room for all the multitudes of living beings and we who
stand at the helm must save them all or perish with them."

Charaka extended his hand and said: "I thank you, venerable sir, for the
light you have afforded me. I sought peace of soul in a monastery, but
the love of life, the love of God, the love of knowledge, the love of my
heart, drove me hack to the world. I have proved useful to King Kanishka
as a physician, perhaps also as a friend, and as a disciple of the
Tathâgata; and the problem before me is, whether it is right for me to
remain in the world, to be a householder, to allow the particular, the
sensual, the actual, a share in life by the side of the universal, the
spiritual, the ideal."

"Do not despise the particular, the sensual, the actual," replied
Açvaghosha. "In the material body the spiritual truths of goodness and
love and veracity are actualised. Existence if it is mere existence,
quantity of life and not quality, is worthless and contemptible. The
sage despises it. The sensual, if it be void of

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

the spiritual, is coarse and marks the brute. But existence is not wrong
in itself, nor is the sensual without its good uses. The sensual, in its
very particularity, by being an aspiration that is actual, becomes
consecrated in spirituality. Think how holy is the kiss of true love;
how sacred is the relation between husband and wife. It is the
particular in which the universal must be realised, mere abstract
goodness will become apparent only in the vicissitudes of actual life."

"If I could serve the Buddha as a householder, my highest ambition would
be to be a brother-in-law to King Kanishka," replied Charaka.

"I know it," said Açvaghosha with a smile, "for the emotions of your
heart are reflected in your eyes. Go home and greet the king's sister
with a saying of the Blessed One, and when you are married may your
happiness be in proportion to your merit, or even greater and better.
Buddha's doctrine is not extinction, not nihilism, but a liberation of
man's heart from the fetters of selfishness and from the seclusion of a
separate egoity. It is not the

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

suppression or eradication of love, and joy, and family ties, but their
perfection and sanctification; not a cessation of life, but a cessation
of ignorance, indolence, and ill will, for the sake of gaining
enlightenment, which is life's end and aim."

After a pause Açvaghosha added pensively: "The more the truth spreads,
the more shall all relations and conditions be transfigured by
Buddhahood. Even the dumb creatures and inanimate nature are yearning
for their emancipation that is to come."

"Your instruction has benefited me too," said Kanishka to the
philosopher, and turning round to the king of Magadha, he continued,
"but you my noble friend and host are still my debtor. Since Açvaghosha
on account of his age finds himself unable to follow me to Gandhâra, you
are in duty bound to procure an acceptable substitute. Now, there is a
wav of settling your obligations to me, and that could be done if your
daughter, the Princess Bhadraçrî would consent to accept my hand and
accompany me to Gandhâra as my wife and queen!"

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

"My august friend," replied the king of Magadha, "I know that the
Princess worships you for the heroism you have displayed in battle, the
wisdom you have shown in council, and the magnanimity with which you
have dealt with your conquered enemy. She beholds in you not only the
ideal of royalty but also the restorer of her father's fortunes, worthy
of her sincerest gratitude. It is but for you to make her admiration
blossom out into rich love and wifely devotion."
