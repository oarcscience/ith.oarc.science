# The Questions of King Milinda

## translated by T. W. Rhys Davids

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a translation of a series of dialogues between King Milinda and
Nagasena, a Buddhist scholar. The Questions of King Milinda deals with
some of the thorniest questions of Buddhism, religion and existence. The
narrative proceeds in a cyclical fashion as the King proposes a
difficult question of Nagasena, who responds typically with either a
tale about the Buddha in some previous life, or an analogy. The book
represents Southern Buddhism at an advanced stage of development. While
difficult questions are addressed here, Milinda makes fascinating
reading, as many of the issues are common to all religions.

These volumes were reprinted by Dover publications in 1963;
unfortunately the Dover edition is now out of print; you may be able to
find used copies, however.
