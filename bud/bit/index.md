This mid-19th Century work is one of the few public domain descriptions
of Tibetan Buddhism we have found. Desipte the sketchy knowledge of
Buddhism in Europe at the time, this has a surprising level of detail
about the subject, due to the pioneering field work of the authors'
brothers. Some of the information in this book about sacred documents,
divination methods, calendrical systems, as well as details of rituals
and ritual objects is unique.
