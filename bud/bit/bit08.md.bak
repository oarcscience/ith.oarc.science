# CHAPTER V

### THE MAHÂYÂNA SYSTEMS

NÂGÂRJUNA.--THE FUNDAMENTAL MAHÂYÂNA PRINCIPLES.--THE CONTEMPLATIVE
MAHÂYÂNA (YOGÂCHÂRYA) SYSTEM.--THE PRASANGA-MADHYAMIKA SCHOOL.

Nâgârjuna.

MOST of the sacred Tibetan writers consider Nâgârjuna (in Tibetan
Lugrub) as the founder of this system, which means "great vehicle."
Nâgârjuna is reported in their books to have lived in the southern parts
of India, four hundred years after the death of the Buddha Sâkyamuni or
according to Westergaards calculation in the first century A.D.; the
sacred books of the Southern Buddhists give the second century B.C.\[1\]
The Tibetan historiograph Târânâtha, however, is of opinion, that the
most important Mahâyâna books had already appeared

\[1. See p. 7.--The Tibetans are decidedly wrong in considering
Nâgârjuna as the author of the numerous Mahâyâna writings; for the
treatises which they refer to him are ascribed in the Chinese
translations to other authors. According to Wassiljew's opinion he is
most probably a mythological personage, without any real existence; in
which case we should have to regard Nâgârjuna as the generic name of the
various authors who wrote upon the Mahâyâna doctrine before the time of
Âryâsanga. See his "Buddhismus," pp. 140, 219.\]

{p. 31}

the Time of Srî Saraha, or Râhulabhadra, who lived shortly before
Nâgârjuna.

According to some Tibetan legends, Nâgârjuna received the book
Paramârtha, according to others the book Avatamsaka, from the Nâgas,
fabulous creatures of the nature of serpents, who occupy a place among
the beings superior to man, and are regarded as protectors of the law of
the Buddha.\[1\] To these spiritual beings Sâkyamuni is said to have
taught a more philosophical religious system than to men, who were not
sufficiently advanced to understand it at the time of his appearance. In
a Chinese biography Nâgârjuna is described as an exceedingly clever man,
who considered his theory to be entirely different from that of Buddhism
in its contemporaneous form, until, after conversation with the Nâgas,
he discovered an exactly similar doctrine to have been taught by the
Buddha Sâkyamuni himself. Hence the biographer infers the system to
contain the same principles as those of genuine Buddhism, though it is
more sublime. This vindication of orthodoxy naturally leads to the
conclusion, that Nâgârjuna's followers were well aware of their being in
opposition to the Hînayâna schools, which they would have reproached
with heresy, had the latter not adopted some of the principles
established in the new system, and by doing so, admitted the correctness
of the innovations thus introduced. The Hînayâna system existed still
for many centuries; Hiuen Thsang, in his reports, frequently mentions
that he has met during his travels adherents of the "little vehicle."

\[1. Concerning the Nâgas see, Foe koue ki, English translation, p.
156.\]

{p. 32}

In none of the sacred books treating on the Mahâyâna system do we find a
record of the historical development of its theories prior to the
appearance of Âryâsanga (in Tibetan Chagpa thogmed), a reformer who
founded the Yogâchârya school (in Tibetan, Naljor chodpa).\[1\] It is
impossible, therefore, to indicate, with any approximation to accuracy,
either the origin, or the authors, of the divergent theories to be
clearly traced in the Mahâyâna religious books, which were all of them
written before Âryâsanga's time. In the works relating to this system
two divisions essentially different are apparent: the first illustrating
the principles of Nâgârjuna, which have been adopted by the Madhyamika
schools (Tib. Bumapa); the second, which is the more developed one,
being appropriated by the Yogâchârya school, or the contemplative
Mahâyâna. I shall treat these divisions separately as also the
peculiarities that developed in the Prasanga branch, the most important
of the Madhyamika system.

The fundamental Mahâyâna principles.

The leading principles of this doctrine are to be found in the earliest
works attributed to Nâgârjuna, among

\[1. Âryâsanga is said to have been taught his doctrine by the future
Buddha Maitreya, the president of the region Tushita, from whom he
received back the five short treatises in verse known in Tibet as "the
five books of Maitreya," or Champai chos nga. Csoma places him in the
seventh century, but according to Wassiljew's researches (pp. 225, 230)
he must have lived much sooner, as the biography of his younger brother,
Vasubandhu, was translated by the celebrated Tshin thi into Chinese
under the dynasty Tshin, who ruled between the years 557-588 A.D. Also
the the {*sic*} remarks of Wilson in R. As. Soc., Vol. VI., p. 240, on
the period when the principal works still extant in Sanskrit were
written, may be quoted in prove of the period being an earlier one. He
believes it now "established, that they have been written at the latest,
from a century and a half before to as much after, the era of
Christianity."\]

{p. 33}

which may be specially mentioned: Samâdhirâja,, Buddhâvatamsaka, and
Ratnakûta.

I. The fundamental dogma is that of the emptiness, or nothingness of
things (in Tib. Tongpanyid, in Sanskrit Sûnyatâ); it is also called
Prajnâ Pâramitâ (in Tib. Pharchin, also Sherchin), "the supreme
intelligence which arrives at the other side of the river."\[1\] This
dogma, it is evident, is simply an enlargement and development of the
principal law of Buddhism:--All is perishable, or partakes of
impermanence, misery, and unreality. The idea of emptiness is referred
both to single objects absolute existence in general. When relating to
single objects, the expression "void or ideal" signifies that which we
consider in any object as original, existing by itself, and permanent;
hence, even the Buddha is but the product of judicious reflection and
meditation. When referred to absolute existence, emptiness is the
abstract essence, existing in every thing without causal connexion, and
comprising all though containing nothing.

Sâkyamuni is said to have connected this dogma with the consideration,
"that no existing object has a nature, Ngovonyid, whence it follows,
that there is neither beginning nor end--that from time immemorial all.
has been perfect quietude, Zodmanas zhiba (viz. nothing has manifested
itself in any form), and is entirely immersed in Nirvâna." The Mahâyâna
schools demonstrate the doctrine of voidness by the dogma of the three
characteristic

\[1. There is an interesting treatise on nothingness, called the
Vajramandâ Dhâranî, which contains a *resumé* of the ideas connected
with this dogma. It is translated by Burnouf in his "Introduction," p.
548. Concerning the dogmas of the Mahâyâna system see Wassiljew, 1. c.,
pp. 128-43, 319-24, 330.\]

{p. 34}

marks, and of the two truths; the three characteristic marks enumerating
the properties of any existing object, and the two truths showing how by
the perfect understanding of these properties clear comprehension shall
be attained.

The three characteristic marks are the following: Parikalpita (Tib. Kun
tag), Paratantra (Tib. Zhan vang), and Parinishpanna (Tib. Yong grub).

Parikalpita is the supposition, or the error. Of this kind is the belief
in absolute existence to which those beings adhere who are incapable of
understanding that every thing is empty; of this kind is also whatever
exists in idea only, without specific quality; or, in other words,
whatever is attributed by our reflections and meditations to any object.
The error can be two-fold; some believing a thing existing Which does
not, as *e. g.* the Non-ego; others assert the real existence of an
object which only exists in the idea, as *e. g.* all outward things.

Paratantra is whatever exists by a dependent or causal connexion; it
forms the basis of the error. Of this kind are: the soul, the sense,
comprehension, and also imperfect philosophical meditation. Every object
exists by concatenation, and has a specific nature; therefore, it is
called dependent upon others, Paratantra.

Parinishpanna, "completely perfect," or simply "perfect," is the
unchangeable and unassignable true existence, which is also the scope of
the path, the *summum bonum*, the absolute. Of this kind can be only
that which enters the mind clear and undarkened, as for instance,

{p. 35}

the emptiness, or the Non-ego. In order, therefore, that his mind may
become free from all that would in any way attract his attention, it is
necessary that man view every thing existing as ideal, because it is
dependent upon something else; then only--as a natural consequence--he
arrives at a right understanding of the Non-ego, and to a knowledge of
how the voidness is alone self-existent and perfect.\[1\]

We now come to the two truths. They are: Samvritisatya (Tib. Kundzabehi
denpa) and Paramârthasatya (Tib. Dondampai denpa), or the relative truth
and the absolute one. Numerous are the definitions given of these
technical terms in the sacred books, but the two principal stand as
follows:--

1\. Samvriti is that which is supposed as the efficiency of a name, or
of a characteristic sign; Paramârtha is the opposite. A difference
prevails between the Yogâchâryas and the Madhyamikas with reference to
the interpretation of Paramârtha; the former say that Paramârtha is also
what is dependent upon other things (Paratantra); the latter say that it
is limited to Parinishpanna, or to that which has the character of
absolute perfection. In consequence, for the Yogâchâryas Samvriti is
Parikalpita *and* Paratantra, for the Madhyamikas Parikalpita only.

2\. Samvriti is that which is the origin of illusion, but Paramârtha is
the Self-consciousness\[2\] of the saint in

\[1. These technical terms were introduced by the Yogâchârya,
school.--For a comparison of Nirvâna with the wind, to illustrate the
nature of Nirvâna, see Hardy's Eastern Monachism, p. 295.

2\. Sanskrit Svasamvedana, "the reflection which analyses itself."\]

{p. 36}

his self-meditation, which is able to dissipate illusions, *i. e.*,
which is above all (parama) and contains the true understanding (artha).

II\. The world, or the Samsâra, must be renounced, not because it is a
source of sorrow and pain, as Sâkyamuni himself and the Hînayâna
followers say, but on account of its unreality, as it contains nothing
which can satisfy the mind.

III\. Besides the cleaving to existing objects, even thinking of any
object or properties whatever, is sufficient to hinder final perfection,
and the obtaining of the intelligence (Bôdhi) of a Buddha. Man must,
therefore, not only curb his passions and abstain from the pleasures of
life, but it is not even permissible for him to allow any notion to
become the object of his meditation.

IV\. Ordinary morality is not sufficient for deliverance from
metempsychosis. Those who really strive after final emancipation, must
assiduously practise the six transcendental, or cardinal virtues.

These cardinal virtues are:--\[1\]

|               |                                       |                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 1\. Charity.  | 3\. Patience.                         | 5\. Meditation. |
| 2\. Morality. | 4\. Industry, or earnest application. | 6\. Ingenuity.  |

 

V. The term "Bôdhisattva" has almost entirely lost its original meaning,
and is now used in a double sense. In the one sense it is applied to all
those who practise the six Pâramitâs; in the other to the perfect beings
who pass between the different worlds. We find

\[1. In numerous religious books four more virtues are added. 1. Method,
or manner; 2. Wish, or prayer; 3. Fortitude; 4. Fore-knowledge, or
knowledge. See Csoma, in As. Res., Vol. XX., p. 399; Burnouf, "Le Lotus
de la Bonne Loi" p. 544.\]

{p. 37}

them in the legends contemporaneous with the Buddhas, travelling with
them, and listening to the words of the Buddhas, who occasionally send
them to remote regions to deliver a message, or receive particular
instructions. These Bôdhisattvas are subdivided into several classes,
the most Sublime among them being nearly equal to the Buddhas, from whom
also it is possible they may have emanated; to some of them indeed a
rank seems to have been assigned (though apparently without success)
which is superior even to that of the Buddhas. They have fulfilled all
the conditions for the attainment of the Buddhaship, and might
immediately become most perfect Buddhas, did they not prefer, from
unlimited charity towards animated beings, to remain still subject to
the law of metempsychosis, and to re-incorporate themselves in human
shape for the benefit of man. When once arrived at the estate of a most
perfect Buddha it would be beyond their power to contribute to man's
salvation, the Buddhas caring no longer for the world when they have
once left it.\[1\] In cases of need, therefore, prayers for assistance
are addressed not to the Buddhas, but to the Bôdhisattvas, who have
shown themselves so friendly and well-towards disposed man. The
addressing of prayers to the Buddhas residing in other regions, we must
consider as only a further development of Mahâyâna Buddhism.'

\[1. Concerning this important dogma see Hardy "Eastern Monachism," p.
228.

2\. The dogma of celestial Bôdhisattvas, the progeny of such Buddhas,
has been developed only in mysticism, and not in the genuine Mahâyâna
system.\]

{p. 38}

VI\. The Mahâyâna system does not exclude laymen from Nirvâna; it admits
every one, layman as well as priest, to the condition of a supreme
Buddha, and applies this name to all who have attained Nirvâna. With
regard to the nature of the Buddhas, their definition is materially
altered: they are no longer entirely deprived of every personality, and
are believed to have a body with certain qualities, and to possess
various faculties. By the Mahâyânas they have three different kinds of
bodies ascribed to them, and, on leaving the world to return to the
higher regions, are supposed to strip off only the last and least
sublime of these earthly encumbrances, called the Nirmânakâya. These
bodies are styled:--

1\. *Nirmânakâya* (Tib. Prulpai ku), which is the Nirvâna with the
remains, or body in which the Bôdhisattva appears upon earth in order to
teach man, after entering by the six Pâramitâs, the path, or career of
the Buddhas.

2\. *Sambhogakâya* (Tib. Longchod dzogpai ku), or the body of bliss and
the reward of fulfilling the three conditions of perfection.

3\. *Dharmakâya* (Tib. Chos ku), or the Nirvâna without any remains.
This ideal body (the most sublime one) is obtained by the Buddha who
abandons the world for ever, and leaves behind everything that has any
connexion with it.'

\[1. Schott, "Buddhaismus," p. 9; Csoma, "Notices" in Journ. As. Soc.
Beng., Vol. VII., p. 142; Schmidt, "Grundlehren," in Mémoires de
l'Académie de St. Petersbourg, Vol. I., pp. 224 *et seq.* For the
Tibetan terms, see A. Schiefner, "Buddhistische Triglotte," leaf 4.\]

{p. 39}

The Contemplative Mahâyâna (Yogâchârya) system.

The contemplative system is described in those works which, in viewing
the doctrine of the Pâramitâs, have started from the consideration that
the three worlds exist only in imagination (Tib. Semtsamo). Such works
are the Ghanavyûha (the Gandavyûha of Burnouf), the Mahâsamaya, and
certain others. The saints Nanda, (Tib. Gavo), Utarasena (Tib. Dampai
de), and Samyaksatya (Tib. Yangdag den), are probably among the number
teaching in this sense previous to Âryâsanga; the latter, however, must
be considered as the real founder of the System.'

Like the preceding, the present system also requires abstinence from
every kind of reflection,, as interfering with clear comprehension; but
the most important dogma established by this theory is decidedly the
personification of the voidness, by supposing that a soul, Âlaya (Tib.
Tsang, also Nyingpo), is the basis of every thing. This soul exists from
time immemorial, and in every object; "it reflects itself in every
thing, likes the moon in clear and tranquil water." It was the loss of
its original purity that caused it to wander about in the various
spheres of existence. The restoration of the soul to its purity can be
attained by the same means as in the preceding system; but now the
motive and the success become evident; ignorance is annihilated and the
illusion that anything can be real is dissipated; man understands at

\[1. Wassiljew, l. c., pp. 143 *et seq.*; 164, 174, 334-47.\]

{p. 40}

length clearly, that the three worlds are but ideal; he gets rid of
impurity, and returns to his original nature, and it is thus that he
becomes emancipated from metempsychosis. Of course, as with everything
belonging to the world, this nature also is only ideal; but the dogma
once established that an absolute pure nature exists, Buddhism soon
proceeded in the mystical school further to endow it with the character
of an all-embracing deity.\[1\] A material modification of its original
character was thus established.

This idea of the soul, Âlaya, is the chief dogma of the Yogâchârya
system, which is so called because "he who is strong in the Yoga
(meditation) is able to introduce his soul by means of the Yoga into the
true nature of existence." There occur, however, amongst the Tibetans,
several explanations of this term, as well as other titles given to this
school; but this name is the most common, and the line of arguments
already instanced is ascribed to Âryâsanga. To the importance which,
from the very first, this school has attributed to meditation, may be
traced the germs which subsequently led to its losing itself in
mysticism.

Âryâsanga and his successors managed to endow their doctrines with such
splendour, that the Nâgârjuna, school with the principles taught by it
(which had been adopted by the Madhyamikas, Tib. Bumapa) had sunk almost
entirely into oblivion for many centuries. It revived, however,

\[1. Japanese Buddhism also speaks of a supreme Buddha, who sits throned
in the diamond world and has created all the Buddhas. See Hoffmann,
"Buddha Pantheon von Nippon," in v. Siebold's "Beschreibung von Japan)"
Vol. II., p. 57.\]

{p. 41}

in the seventh century under the name of the Prasanga branch; and this
still remains to be treated before concluding our notices of the
Mahâyâna systems.

The Prasanga-Madhyamika school.

This school,\[1\] in Tibetan probably called Thal gyurva, was founded by
Buddhapâlita, and soon succeeded in superseding all other schools of the
Mahâyâna system, notwithstanding the attacks made upon it by Bhavya, the
originator of the Svatantra-Madhyamika school. The success attained by
the Prasanga School is due, in a great measure, to the excellent
commentaries and introductory works written in the eighth and ninth
centuries by. Chandrakirti (Tib. Dava Dagpa) and other learned men.
These events coinciding with a numerous immigration of Indian priests
into Tibet, caused the Prasanga school to be at present considered by
the Tibetan Lamas as that which alone taught and gave the true
explanation of the faith revealed by the Buddha.

The Prasanga, school obtained its name from the peculiar mode which it
adopted of deducing the absurdity and erroneousness of every esoteric
opinion. "The Prasangas say that the two truths, Samvriti and
Paramârtha, cannot be maintained as either identical or different; if
they were identical, we should strip off the Paramârtha together with
Samvriti, and if they were different, we should not be able to become
delivered from Samvriti.

\[1. Wassiljew, "Der Buddhismus,',' pp. 327; 357-67. Compare Csomas'
Notices, in Journ. As. Soc. Beng., Vol. VII., p. 144.\]

{p. 42} In understanding by the term Non-ego all objects which are
compound, or exist in Samvriti, we attribute to it a character identical
with being existent and uncompounded (Paramârtha); but if this is
already the character of Samvriti, it denotes that the objects have
already a perfect existence; hence they have already arrived at
salvation (Tib. Dolzin). From such and similar hair-splitting
considerations the Prasangas deduce that both truths have 'one and the
same nature' (Tib. Ngovo chig), but two distinct meanings (Tib. Togpa
nyi). These speculations are called Prasanga."

The Prasanga school maintains that the doctrines of the Buddha establish
two paths-one leading to the highest regions of the universe, to the
heaven, Sukhavatî,\[1\] where. man enjoys perfect happiness but
connected with personal existence; the other conducting to entire
emancipation from the world, viz. to Nirvâna. The former path is
attained by the practice of virtues, the latter by the highest
perfection of intelligence. They reckon eight (according to some writers
even eleven) peculiarities by which their system distinguishes itself
from all the others; out of these eleven peculiarities, as given by the
Tibetan Jam. Yang shadpa, I select the following as the most
characteristic, the others being but a repetition of general Mahâyâna
principles, or deductions contained in their own.

1\. The principal dogma is the negation of existence as well as of
non-existence; they admit neither self-existence (absolute existence),
Paramârtha, nor existence

\[1. See for particulars Chapter IX.\]

{p. 43}

by causal connexion, Samvriti: in order not to fall into extremes. For,
not to say of what has never existed, to be; and of the truly existing,
not to be; this is to take a middle way, Madhyama.\[1\] This dogma is
formulated as follows:--"By denying the extreme of existence is also
denied, in consequence of conditional appearance, the extreme of
non-existence, which is not in Paramârtha." The arguments in proof of
this thesis are most circumstantial; the following most curious
syllogisms occur in Jam Yang shadpa's work:-

1\. If the plant grew by its own specific nature, it would not be a
composition, Tenbrel; it is demonstrated, however, that it is a
composition.

2\. If anything in nature were self-existent, we should certainly hear
and see it; for the sensation of seeing and hearing would in this case
be absolutely identical.

3\. The quality of being general would not be peculiar to many things,
because it would be an indivisible unity, as such a unity we should be
obliged to take the *ego*, if there were an *ego*.

4\. The plant would not be compelled to grew anew, because it would
continue to exist.

5\. If any Skandha,\[2\] as sensation, were self-existent,

\[1. They are also called, on account of this theory, "those who deny
existence (nature)," in Tibetan, Ngovonyid medpar mraba.

2\. The Buddhists enumerate five essential properties of sentient
existence, which are styled Skandhas, or Sîlaskandhas, in Tibetan,
Tsulkhrim kyi phungpo, "the aggregates of morals." They are: 1. The
organized body; 2. Sensation; 3. Perception; 4. Discrimination; 6.
Consciousness. See Burnouf, Index, *voce* Skandha; Hardy's Manual of
Buddhism, pp. 388, 399-424.--For the Tibetan designations of the five
Skandhas see "Buddhistische Triglotte," by A. Schiefner, leaf 9.\]

{p. 44}

another Skandha, as *e. g.* the organized body, would be also
self-existent; but it is impossible to produce by the self-existence of
sensation that of the organized body, because the plastic power and the
object to be formed are identical.

2\. The Âlaya has an absolute eternal existence; those treatises do not
teach the right doctrine which attribute to it only a relative
existence.

3\. Not only the Arhats, but also simple men, if they have entered the
path, can arrive at the rude comprehension of the sixteen kinds of the
four truths by 'very evident (earnest) meditation" (Tib. Naljor
ngonsum); but those systems are considered wrong which pretend, as the
Hînayâna, that the knowledge (Vishnâna) derived from such meditation
(which is nothing but a manifestation of the Âlaya) be not liable to
errors (Sansk. Vikalpa, Tib. Namtog). Even the Arhat goes to hell in
case he doubt anything. This reproach is meant to be made to the schools
by which the Arhats are admitted to Nirvâna under any condition.\[1\]

4\. The three periods: the present, the past, and the future, are
compounds, correlative to each other. The Buddha has declared: "A harsh
word, uttered in past times, if; not lost (literally *destroyed*), but
returns again;" and, therefore, the past time is the present time, as is
also the future, though as yet it has not come into existence.

5\. The Buddha has two kinds of Nirvâna: Nirvâna with remains and
Nirvâna without remains; the latter

\[1. The means of avoiding the error have been more fully developed by
mysticism in the exigencies of Vipasyana and Samatha. See p. 54.\]

{p. 45}

kind only is entire extinction of personality, or the state where the
notion of *ego* ceases, where the outward and inward man is destroyed.
In this state, the Buddha has assumed the body Dharmakâya, in which
there is neither beginning nor end; whilst in the Nirvâna with remains
he has obtained only the Nirmânakâya body, in which, though rendered
impervious to outward impressions, he has not yet thrown off habitual
errors (the influence of passions), of which nothing remains in the
other kind of Nirvâna.

The Prasangas admit as orthodox the greater part of the hymns in the
Tanjur, and those of the Sûtras which are contained in the Kanjur; in
these, they say, the true meaning of the word of the Buddha (viz. the
Madhyamika doctrine) is explained. There exist a large number of such
books, the most important of which are the seventeen books of the
Prajnâpâramitâ, then the Akshayamatinirdesa, the Samâdhirâja, the
Anavataptapariprichchhâ, Dharmasamgîti, the Sagarapariprichchha, the
Manjusrîvikrîdita, the first chapter of the Ratnakûta, and the chapter
of Kâsyapa, which is quoted by Nâgârjuna and his disciples in support of
their dogmas.\[1\]

It is remarkable to see at what extravagances Buddhist speculation has
arrived by its tendency to follow abstract ideas without the
consideration of the limits presented by bodily experience and the laws
of nature. But the case is rather not an isolated one; we meet instances
of analogous dreams in ancient and modern times.

\[1. Wassiljew in his examination of the most important Mahâyâna Sûtras,
pp. 157-202, presents an analysis of the Manjusrîvikrîdita and the
Ratnakûta.\]
