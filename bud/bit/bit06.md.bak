# CHAPTER III

### THE RELIGIOUS SYSTEM OF SÂKYAMUNI

THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW.--THE DOGMA OF THE FOUR TRUTHS, AND THE PATHS
LEADING TO SALVATION.

SÂKYAMUNI, although the founder of Buddhism, is, at the present day, no
longer considered to have been the first Buddha. Many most perfect
Buddhas preceded him (so it is now believed), and many more shall appear
hereafter; but they all teach the same law.\[1\]

The original religious system, as taught by Sâkyamuni himself, is plain
in its principles, but characterized by bold, philosophical speculation;
its *fundamental dogma* is the following:--\[2\]

All existence is an evil; for birth originates sorrow,

\[1. This theory seems to have been introduced into Buddhist mythology
already by the Sautrântika school. See Wassiljew, "Der Buddhismus," p.
314. To this dogma also the name of Tathâgata refers (see p. 4); for the
philosophical explanation of this term with "thus gone," quoted by
Hodgson from original works, see Burnouf, "Introduction," p. 75.

2\. See the valuable exposition of Köppen, "Die Religion des Buddha,"
pp. 213-26. Notices on the earliest dogma of Buddhism occur in numerous
passages of Burnouf's "Introduction dans le Buddhisme Indien," and
"Lotus de la Bonne Loi;" in Hardy's "Eastern Monachism," and "Manual of
Buddhism."\]

pain, decay, and death. The present life is not the first one;
innumerable births have preceded it in previous ages. The reproduction
of a new existence is the consequence of the desire for existing
objects, and of the works which have been aggregated in an unbroken
succession from the commencement of existence. Proneness to the
pleasures, of life produces the new being; the works of the former
existences fix the condition in which this new being is to be born. If
these works have been good the being will come to existence in a state
of happiness and distinction; if, on the contrary, they have been bad,
the being will be born into a state of misery and degradation. The
absolute annihilation of the conditions and pains of
existence--Nirvâna--is attained by the most perfect dominion over
passion, evil desire, and natural sensation.

Sâkyamuni has explained this fundamental doctrine in the theory of the
*four excellent truths*: THE PAIN, THE PRODUCTION, THE CESSATION, THE
PATH; they are called in Sanskrit Âryâni Satyâni, and in Tibetan Phagpai
denpa zhi. Their meaning may be defined as follows:

1\. Pain cannot be separated from existence.

2\. Existence is produced by passions and evil desires.

3\. Existence is brought to an end by the cessation of evil desires.

4\. Revelation of the path to this cessation.

In detailing the moral precepts of the fourtth {*sic*} truth he has
indicated eight good paths:

1\. The right opinion or orthodoxy.

2\. The right judgment, which dissipates every doubt and incertitude.

3\. The right words, or perfect meditation.

4\. The right mode of acting, or of keeping in view in every action a
pure and honest aim.

5\. The right way of supporting life, or of gaining a subsistence by an
honest profession unstained by sins.

6\. The rightly directed intelligence, which leads to final salvation
("to the other side of the river").

7\. The right memory, which enables man to impress strongly in his mind
what should not be forgotten.

8\. The right meditation, or tranquil mind, by which alone steadiness in
meditation can be attained, undisturbed by any event whatever.

It has been doubted with much reason, whether Sâkyamuni taught the four
truths in this form; but as he must have spoken about the means of
arriving at final liberation, or salvation, I have added here these
eight classes of the path, which are suggested to him already in very
early Sûtras.\[1\]

The theory of the four truths has been formulated in a short sentence,
which has been discovered on many ancient Buddhist images, and which is
besides actually recited as a kind of confession of faith, and added to
religious treatises. It runs thus: "Of all things proceeding from cause,
the cause of their procession hath the Tathâgata explained. The great
Sramana has likewise declared the cause of the extinction of all
things."\[2\] Tathâgata and

\[1. Concerning the four truths see: Csoma. "Notices," in As. Res., Vol.
XX., pp. 294, 303; Burnouf's "Introduction," pp. 290, 629, and "Le Lotus
de la Bonne Loi," App. V. Another series of eight classes, which is
decidedly the produce of the later schools, will be noticed in the next
chapter.

2\. This sentence is also the conclusion in the address to the Buddhas
of {footnote p. 18} confession, for which see Chapter XI.--In the
translation. of this sentence I have followed Hodgson; see his
"Illustrations," p. 158. Other translations of various readings have
been published by Prinsep, Csoma, Mill, and recently compared by Colonel
Sykes. See his "Miniature Chaityas and inscriptions of the Buddhist
religious dogma," in R. As. Soc., Vol. XVI., p. 37. The Sanskrit text
written with Tibetan characters, and the Tibetan version is given in
Plate I.\]

{p. 18}

Sramana are two epithets of Sâkyamuni, as explained before.

The ancient religious works apply to Sâkyamuni's followers the title of
Srâvakas "*hearers*," a name also having reference to their spiritual
perfection. The Buddhists of this period seem to have called themselves
Sramanas, "those who restrain their thoughts, the purely acting," in
allusion to their moral virtues as well as their general conduct.\[1\]
