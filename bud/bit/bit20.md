### DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS TABLES USED FOR ASTROLOGICAL PURPOSES

IMPORTANCE ATTRIBUTED To ASTROLOGY--I. TABLES FOR INDICATING LUCKY AND
UNLUCKY PERIODS. 1. The elements and. cyclic animals. 2. The spirits of
the season. 3. Figures and oracles for determining the character of a
given day--II. TABLES FOR DIRECTION IN IMPORTANT UNDERTAKINGS 1. The
square tortoise. 2. The circular tortoise.--III. TABLES OF DESTINY IN
CASES OF SICKNESS. 1. The human figures. 2. Allegorical figures and
dice.--IV. TABLES OF MARRIAGE. 1. Table with numerals. 2. Table with
cyclic animals.--V. A SOOTHSAYING TABLE WITH NUMEROUS FIGURES AND
SENTENCES.

Importance attributed to astrology.

THE Tibetans, like all primitive nations, attribute to the position of
the sun in reference to the constellations, to the planets, to the
direct active interference of gods and spirits, and such like, a very
considerable influence upon the welfare of man in this and in future
existences. To their priests, the Lamas, they ascribe the faculty of
deciding what circumstances are to be considered as favourable, and what
unfavourable, for counteracting the effect of influences prejudicial to
man, and for obtaining the assistance of benevolent spirits. These ends
they seek to

{p. 291}

attain by the performance of certain ceremonies and the presentation of
various offerings; and nearly every individual case requires to be
accompanied by a ceremony,\[1\] the efficacy of which does not, however,
depend upon its being performed by any particular Lama, although the
services of a Lama in great repute for sanctity are considered to
increase the chances of the ceremony's producing the desired effect. But
with respect to the science of "divination," having for object the
determining of the character of a day, the residence for the time being
of the gods, &c., the Lamas are not held to be equally endowed, one as
the other. Those who have made a particular study of astrology, are
applied to in all important cases having reference to the public
welfare, as well as on such occasions as the marriage or the death of
men of rank and wealth; whilst for subjects of minor importance every
Lama is considered well-informed enough to give the required decision.
In every monastery there is at least one divining Lama, who is then
styled "the astrologer;" and larger ones even have one of the famous
Choichong astrologers.\[2\] These latter have a particular school in the
monastery Garmakhyá at Lhássa, whilst the ordinary astrologers are
instructed in the science by an elder priest; the principal part of
their preparatory labours is the profound study of numerous mystical
works.

The decisions of the astrologers are pretended to be

\[1. Some of the ceremonies considered the most efficacious, and
therefore the most frequently performed, have been described in Chapter
XV.

2\. See p. 156.\]

{p. 292}

the result of mathematical calculations, combined with due observation
of the phenomena to be taken into consideration for the case in point.
The corresponding phenomena and their value vary considerably; there
are, however, certain rules respecting the different modalities, and the
explanation of these rules forms the subject of numerous books on
astrology. The deference paid to the Lamas in such things depends to a
great extent upon the observance of secrecy with reference to the
combinations employed and the ceremonies performed; these things are
kept a perfect secret to Tibetans as well as to Europeans; and even
Chibu Lama, who, in his intercourse with Europeans, had laid aside many
a superstition, showed great reserve in communicating to my brother
Hermann the clue to symbolical designs, or such like; although neither
Chibu nor any other Lama ever showed any particular hesitation to sell
such objects, when no detailed explanation was demanded. The St.
Petersburg libraries, also, contain but few in which the rules for their
interpretation are given. Even the different provinces have each its own
peculiar principles of divination, and are but indifferently acquainted
with the operations practised by, and the formularies in use among their
neighbours. Many of the tables and symbolical diagrams described further
on proved quite a novelty to the Lama Gombojew, when he was requested to
transcribe for me into capital letters those sentences which in the
original were written in the small characters.

To the difficulties of obtaining information was added that arising from
the vagueness with which all natives

{p. 293}

speak when attempting any explanation, even of subjects far less
mystical than astrology and divination. This may be offered as an excuse
for the following details not being so complete and satisfactory as
might be desired. And, besides, I could not well alter them much, as in
their existing state they were best calculated to make us acquainted
with the notions of the Tibetans concerning the natural phenomena and
the functions of their gods.

Tables used for the following purposes shall be described:

1\. Tables for indicating lucky and unlucky periods.

2\. Tables of direction, to determine towards what part of the compass
the face of a man is to be turned when praying, and what direction his
feet must take when he is about to set out on an important undertaking.

3\. Tables of destiny, consulted in cases of illness.

4\. Tables of marriage, employed to arrive at a knowledge of the chances
of happiness afforded by some proposed matrimonial alliance.

5\. A soothsaying table, with numerous figures and sentences.

I.

TABLES FOR INDICATING LUCKY AND UNLUCKY PERIODS.

1\. *The elements and cyclic animals*.

Rules and regulations connected with or having reference to the
calendar, as is the case with the table here described,

{p. 294}

are mostly combinations of the figures used in chronology, viz. the
twelve cyclic animals and the five elements. The technical term for such
a table is Gabtsis (see p. 274). In the present case their divinatory
combination forms part of a large roll not unlike in form to the
documents of classical antiquity, on which are also delineated most of
the diagrams subsequently described. It came from Lhássa, and Hermann,
meeting with it at Darjíling, seized the opportunity and bought it. The
Gabtsis is composed of eight lines.

|                               |
|-------------------------------|
| 1\. 30 elements.              |
| 2\. Colours of the elements.  |
| 3\. 60 cyclic animals.        |
| 4\.                           |
| 5\. 3 rows of numerals.       |
| 6\.                           |
| 7\. Sentences, now rubbed off |
| 8\. Heads of the animals.     |

 

Total length: 2 Engl. ft., 1 inch; breadth: 4 inches.

The first and second lines are each subdivided into thirty compartments;
the upper line contains the conventional figures for the elements,\[1\]
the lower their colours. The series of these figures and colours, and
the objects represented are the following:

\[1. The same figures are also used to symbolize the names of the sixty
years adopted from India--A detailed explanation of these signs is
contained in the astronomical book Yangsal Domi, about which see p.
281.\]

The colour of the head is important for the luckiness and unluckiness of
days; if it be the same with the colour of the birthday, the day is an
unlucky one, but the probability of misfortune can be counteracted by
offerings to the tutelary genii.

The *fourth, fifth and sixth lines* contain Tibetan numerals in
compartments tinted with the colours belonging to the respective
numbers. 180 numbers are inscribed, 60 in each horizontal series. They
follow each other in the order here given:

{p. 297}

198765432198765432198765432198765432198765432198765432198765

765432198765432198765432198765432198765432198765432198765432

Each number has a colour which is not a different one for every one of
the nine numbers, but which is never changed for the same number; 1 is
white; 9 is red; 8 is white; 7 is red; 6 is white; 5 is yellow; 4 is
green; 3 is blue; 2 is black. These numerals so coloured are called "the
nine blots," in Tibetan Meba gu, in Mongolian Mangga.\[1\] The
succession of the Mebas is considered as important in many respects; its
chief use is to indicate the years particularly dangerous to existence,
which, according to the notions of the Tibetans return every tenth year;
these are the years, they say, in which "the birth-meba has to
consolidate." As birth-meba is taken that number in the fifth line (the
second line of the series here detailed), which happens to be just
beneath the animal in the sign of which a man has been born; and in the
arrangement described this Meba returns every tenth year, and is also
the central number of nine compartments, the single numbers of which are
exactly identical with those of a group ten, twenty years, &c., distant.
The dangers of these critical years, coinciding with the "consolidations
of the birth-meba," can be averted by the ceremony Ruibal chenpoi
dokjed, "to turn back (the evils) in the name of the great

which the rich generally have performed for them by the Lamas in such
years.

In the *seventh line* thirty sentences had been written, but they had
been almost entirely blotted out already when Hermann got the original.

In the *eighth line* the heads of the sixty animals are repeated, two in
one compartment, to indicate the phases of the moon.

Another table for the same purpose obtained by Adolphe in Gnári Khórsum
has the form of a square; round a tortoise in the Centre are grouped
three times the twelve cyclic animals; in the first series each is
repeated once, in the two other series they are repeated five times, to
constitute the number of sixty. As a curious deviation from the list of
the animals given above, I have to mention that, instead of the ox, we
meet an elephant. Between the two spaces filled with the animals, are
traced the 180 compartments, tinted with the colour of the Mebas and
containing the corresponding numerals. In other divisions of the Square
the symbols of the sun, the moon, and the planets Mars, Mercury,
Jupiter, Venus and Saturn (see p. 289) are added, alternating with
Squares containing the nine Mebas.

2\. *The spirits of the season*.

Amongst the causes of the luckiness and unluckiness of days are included
the periodical migrations of the spirits inhabiting the regions above
the earth. The two kinds of spirits, the good and evil ones, are
supposed to shift their

{p. 299}

abodes, partly every day, partly contemporaneously with the phases of
the moon, the commencement of a new season, &c. They perform their
migrations with unequal velocity, and therefore, the combination of the
spirits varies for every day. It is very important to man, as is
believed, to know which kind of spirits have arrived the very day on
which he begins an undertaking; if the good spirits are more numerous
than the bad ones, the day will be a lucky one, and the more so if the
man's tutelary deity is amongst the good spirits. This belief naturally
offers a wide field of intrigue to the Lamas, who alone are able to
decide the actual movements of the spirits. Amongst the evil spirits
particular attention is to be paid to the abode of four demons, who, in
astrological maps of the sky, are typified by the following figures: a
black dog; a monster with a human body and the tail of a dragon, meaning
a Mahôraga, in Tibetan Tophye chenpo; a man on horseback; and, finally,
the fabulous bird Garuda. Their images are always encircled by a double
square frame; the inner one is divided into twelve compartments, in each
of which the name of a cyclic animal is written; the outer frame
contains Dhâranîs supposed to be able and willing to hinder obnoxious
attempts of the evil spirits. To each of these demons also a season is
assigned; the black dog rules the spring, the Mahôraga the summer, the
man on horseback the autumn, the bird Garuda the winter.

The linear arrangement of such a table is here given: the squares show
the position of the respective four demons, the surrounding numbers the
succession of the names of

{p. 300}

the twelve cyclic animals; the outer space is that containing the
Dhârânîs.

3\. *Figures and Oracles for the Character of a day*.

A day which, according to its number in the series of the days of a
year, should be lucky, may for the individual man become fatal by
circumstances originating from the time of his birth and other important
epochs in his life. But there are days which are lucky under all
circumstances, whilst others are invariably unfavourable. The stability
as well as the variable character of the thirty days of each month is
illustrated by tables divided into thirty principle compartments; the
compartments show the symbolical figures of the single days, and below
each is written a mystical sentence which reveals its character. Such a
table allows one to predict whether the chances of an undertaking are
increased by the character of the

{p. 301}

day, or whether man needs the assistance of a Lama, to tell him from
which spirit or from what direction danger threatens, as also to
indicate the means of averting it. The answer is considered to be
derived from most complicated computations; the cyclic animals and the
elements of the present year, the abode of the tutelary deity, the
birth-meba, and many other things must be taken into consideration. Only
the most expert astrologers are believed to have the necessary
knowledge, and consequently the remuneration demanded for their
assistance and cooperation is high; so that none but the great and
wealthy possess the means of getting indicated the reasons which render
one day lucky, another unlucky. Chibu Lama said that such tables were
generally consulted only by Rajas, and that copies of the book in which
this kind of calculation is detailed are very rare in every Buddhist
country; no copy had to be was in Síkkim.

The table which will be here described also forms part of the great roll
which was bought by Hermann during his travels in 1855, who even
obtained some explanations about the general meaning of the sentences.
When I continued the analysis, first by getting transcribed the
sentences which in the original are written with small characters, which
could be done but very imperfectly, as by the frequent use of the roll
about one-half of the squares had become quite illegible by friction, I
found, also here, so many words used not introduced into Tibetan
literature as known hitherto, that all that could be deciphered with
sufficient accuracy was

{p. 302}

some few words; these I add in brackets to the verbal native
information.

I now give the description of the table. In the upper left-hand corner
(in space No. I.) Manjusrî\[1\] is represented sitting upon a throne; in
the opposite corner (in No. II.) is the sword of wisdom, an emblem of
his superior knowledge. Each of these two figures occupies the
longitudinal space of two squares and the breadth of ones. The rest of
the plate is filled up by the following thirty figures and their
corresponding sentences.

TABLES FOR DIRECTION IN IMPORTANT UNDERTAKINGS.

1\. *The square tortoise*.

The essential figure of such tables is a tortoise, the feet of which are
often drawn as hands (see Plates XIV., XV., XVI.); its shell is divided
into numerous compartments, in each of which an allegorical figure is
traced symbolizing

{p. 305}

some part or direction of the universe. The tortoise is considered by
the Tibetan Buddhists to support the universe; and it is in allusion to
this belief that it is generally drawn surrounded by water, signifying
the ocean which washes the shores of the different continents. The
legend having reference hereto, and which Pallas\[1\] also found to be
spread amongst the Mongolian tribes, is this: As often as the universe,
after its destruction, has to be re-moulded, the chaos, a fluid and
incoherent mass, is somewhat dried by the winds, and the liquid
ingredients separated from the solid. At the time of the creation of the
present world, Manjusrî caused a tortoise of enormous size to emanate
from him and to float in this chaos. Then considering, as god of wisdom,
that the continents to be formed needed a solid basis, he rose up into
the atmosphere and discharged a golden arrow, which struck the tortoise
in its right side causing it to turn over and sink down through the
chaotic mass, dropping blood from its wound, leaving behind its
excrements, and vomiting fire, thus increasing the elementary parts
dissolved in the waters; and when the consolidation took place, it
furnished the basis of the universe, which now rests upon the flat under
side of its shell.

This surface is quite distinctly characterised, in all representations I
have before me, as the under shell, *not* as the back of the tortoise.
The head is turned upwards to show the face, and what makes it more
evident still,

\[1. Compare Pallas, "Mongol. Völkerschaften," Vol. II., p. 21. The
fullest account of it was told by the Lamas to stand in the Tibetan book
Shecha rabsal "history of science."\]

{p. 306}

the human hands connected with the tortoise, have distinctly a position
of the thumb which shows the lower part to the observer. For
astrological purposes this lower part of the tortoise-shell is drawn
either square or circular, which necessarily also causes a very
different arrangement of its component parts. The shell here described
is a square one. The. accompanying sketch shows the distribution of the
compartments; the numbers I have inserted have reference to the figures,
which will be subsequently explained.

\#\#\#

In the centre is traced a circle with eight Mebas in this order: \#\#\#;
the central square is here empty, but in other diagrams of the tortoise
it contains a numeral. A square frame surrounding the circle is the next
division, and contains compartments with the twelve cyclic animals
(their position is indicated in the sketch by the numerals from 1 to
12); it also contains the symbolical signs of the four principal corners
of the universe: No. 13, fire (flames) = north; No. 14, iron (two angles
meaning the Phurbu) = east; No. 15, water (waves) = south; No. 16, tree
(leaves) = west. The rest of the shell is divided into eight principal
divisions

{p. 307}

(No. 17 to 24 of the sketch), which are distinguished by a frame of
double lines; each is subdivided again into nine compartments. In the
central part of every one of these groups we find a mystical sign, one
of the "eight symbolical forms," in Tibetan Parkha chakja chad, meaning
one of the eight regions of the universe, of which there are ten in
all.\[1\] For astrological purposes mystical names are given to them,
and generally they are symbolized by the following signs (see also Plate
XIV., XV.):

\#\#\# North. Li, fire. (In No. 17.)

\#\#\# North-east. Khon, earth. (In No. 18.)

\#\#\# East. Da, iron. (In No. 19)

\#\#\# South-east. Khen, heaven. (In No. 20.)

\#\#\# South. Kham, water. (In No. 21.)

\#\#\# South-west. Gin, mountain. (In No. 22.)

\#\#\# West. Zin, tree. (In No. 23.)

\#\#\# North-west. Zon, air. (In No. 24.)\[2\]

These signs, however, are not exclusively introduced in this form: other
types may be occasionally considered

\[1. See p. 126, 259.

2\. Pallas, "Mongol . Völkerschaften," Vol. II., p. 229, has likewise
inserted the allegorical names for the eight corners of the universe:
his names are the same as above, but the region they typify differs. I
shall have occasion in the next pages to prove, by the place which they
in a occuppy {*???*} compass, that in their explanation he is wrong.\]

{p. 308}

to be more useful, or more damaging to the influence of evil spirits;
and famous astrologers do not unfrequently invent quite new ones; a
specimen of such a deviation is that printed on Plate XVI. where the
signs are these:

|                            |                              |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| \#\#\# North; fire.        | \#\#\# South; water.         |
| \#\#\# North-east; earth.  | \#\#\# South-west; mountain. |
| \#\#\# East; iron.         | \#\#\# West; tree.           |
| \#\#\# South-east; heaven. | \#\#\# North-west; air.      |

 

The remaining eight figures in the smaller squares are in each group the
same; they are likewise symbols of the eight regions, and have besides
each a mystical meaning. The trident is the north; the Phurbu is the
east; by five dots, \#\#\#, five of the dreaded demons are symbolized
whose appearance causes "untimely death," and other misfortunes; they
mean the south. The Dorje is the west. Amongst the other figures parts
of the human body partly male partly female may still be particularly
mentioned. Their relative position varies, and each different
combination shows the region desired for a specific purpose, such as
whither to direct the prayers and the Phurbu in order to ward off
successfully the demons; what direction a bridegroom or a warrior must
take on leaving the house, &c.

{p. 309}

In order to discover the region required, various circumstances have to
be taken into consideration; of the numerous books in which they are
detailed the greatest variety of rules is contained in the books Yangsal
Domi (already quoted p. 280), Chungpa kundus tsis, and Thangshin-gi
tsis. The astrologers are very reserved in communicating these laws;
this would make their art too popular and would deprive it of the
character of sublime mysticism and science, with which they now array
it. All I can say is this: A quantity of numerals corresponding to the
number of years of the questioner is inscribed successively in the nine
compartments of a circle in the order in which the symbolical names of
the quarters of the world are enumerated in the following verses:--

"The centre, the heaven, the iron, the mountain and  
"The fire, the water, the earth, the tree, the air, turning."

The centre means the nadir, the tenth of the regions of the universe
which the Tibetans acknowledge (the ninth region, the zenith, is
omitted). From the number which takes the place of the nadir, the
succession of the others depends; which number has to occupy the centre
I do not know, I have been only informed that attention must be paid to
the sex, as the central number is one with males, another with females.

\[1. The Tibetan text is printed sub No. I., 1, in Plate XVIII.\]

{p. 310} When the central number has become known, the other numerals
are grouped so that the next higher is written in the compartment
heaven, the next higher in the compartment iron, and so on as detailed
in the verses. If the number 9 is reached, it is not 10 which follows
but the series is continued again with 1, 2, &c., till the quantity of
the numerals inscribed is identical with the number of years of the
questioner. The highly mystical character of the rules concerning the
distribution of the Mebas seems to be well illustrated by those
respecting the influence of the sex upon the calculation; they are
brought in the form of verses, and run thus:

"The year of man must be counted by the sign of the heaven, turning like
Bon,  
"The year of women like the doctrine (chos)."\[1\]

For facilitating the correct inscription of the numerals in the
succession required, such representations of the tortoise have not only
in their own centre a circle with nine compartments and the numerals
inscribed in due order, but beneath the tortoise an appendix of eight
other circles is added, which show the due succession of the numerals in
case any one of the nine numerals should fall into the central position.
Also our large roll contains, in Tibetan characters, the following eight
combinations bordered by circles:

\[1. For the Tibetan text see Plate XVIII., No. 1. Bon the dictionaries
explain by an adherent to the Bon religion, about which see p. 74. The
book *bs*Tan-*r*tisis-'dod-*s*byin-*g*ter-bum-zhes-bya-va-*gz*hug*s*,
"Accomplishment of the desire for instruction in astrology, vessel of

2\. *The circular tortoise*.

The shell of the tortoise drawn as a circle is particularly used for
calculating from the combination of the planets with the constellations
at the time of one's birth, from the birth Meba, and other moments,
which deity an individual man has to address as tutelary god in every
year of the sixty years circle. Its surface shows:

The elementary name of each space and its respective position in the
compass I have added in explanation at the foot of the numbers; and if
we look again for these elementary colours in the succession of heaven,
iron, mountain, fire, water, earth, tree, air, we at once remark that
then the horizontal succession of the numbers is exactly the same as in
the eight groups of nine divisions each, page 310, where the next higher
Meba is also inscribed in the succession of heaven, iron, &c.

10th. Compartment. This last circle is divided into

{p. 313}

64 spaces; in 60 the names of the cyclic animals (byi, *g*lang, &c.) are
written; the four remaining symbolical figures of the four principal
points of the compass occupy a position as on our geographical maps;
fire, or the north, being next to the head of the tortoise; Phurbu, or
east, to the right; water, or south, at the tail; leaves, or west, to
the left.

TABLES OF DESTINY IN CASES OF SICKNESS.

1\. *The human figures*.

Sixteen human figures are drawn in two rows; in cases of sickness seeds
or small pebbles are cast upon them to foretell the development and
final result. The succession of these human figures and their appendices
are:--

|                                             |                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Upper line.                                 | Lower line.                                       |
| 1\. A woman with a hook.                    | 9\. A woman with an axe.                          |
| 2\. A woman with a spoon.                   | 10\. A Lama holding a vessel.                     |

2\. *Allegorical figures and dice*.

A rectangular table 6 inches long, and 4 inches broad, divided into 24
parts.

\#\#\#

The squares 1, 2, 3, 4 are filled up by representations of the twelve
cyclic animals, in groups so arranged that one animal is ridden by three
others. They are considered here as introductory figures and have their
particular importance when a marriage is contracted, but not in
reference to sickness; they shall be explained in the subsequent
section, IV. Squares 5 to 16 are the spaces which contain the objects
and sentences consulted in illness; they are: 5. Two coniferous trees.
6. Buildings during inundation. 7. Two coniferous trees. 8. One tree. 9.
Two sacred buildings. 10. Two eyes. The sentences in 10 to 16 are
written in running-hand with abbreviations, so that a literal
transliteration was not possible for square 12. These sentences' follow
in the succession my diagram gives:--

11\. The flourishing (green) tree of life will be broken now or
later--No. 1.

12\. \[The golden tree will now be broken\].--This, however, stands
under the image of the buildings in inundation, in which no allusion to
a tree could be discovered.

13\. The tree of the blue colour of turquoise will be broken now or
later--No. 2.

\[1. Number 12, of which the exact translation could not be given, is
marked by brackets. In the other sentences the numerals after "No." have
reference to the Tibetan text in Plate XVIII., II.\]

{p. 315}

14\. The tree *d*Pag-*b*sam-shing\[1\] will be broken now or later.--No.
3.

15\. The celebrated houses and enclosures will be destroyed now or
later.--No. 4.

16\. Now or later the eyes of death shall meet you.--No. 5.\[2\]

The spaces 19 to 24 represent the six surfaces of a die. The dots upon
dice used for soothsaying purposes show here. the following arrangment,
one half of the dots being white, the other black.

\#\#\#

The dice are either cubes, like the European ones, or rectangular
parallepidedons, sometimes comparatively very long. The latter, in
consequence of their form, have two sides blank.

IV\.

TABLES FOR MARRIAGE.

1\. *Table with numerals*.

One diagram of this kind shows a table of nine squares, each divided
again into nine spaces; the central is a rectangle, in which is
inscribed a short sentence; the eight surrounding

\[1. It is a fabulous tree which accomplishes every wish. Schmidt,
"Tibet. Lexicon."

2\. A great number of similar oracles have been compiled in the book
Jed-tho yangi zamatog "handbook of oracles."\]

{p. 316}

spaces contain each the number of a Meba. The arrangement of the
numerals is as given in the accompanying figure.

\#\#\#

The sentences in the rectangles were explained to Hermann to run
thus:\[1\]

I. Medicine of the sky, true.

II\. Medicine of the sky, middle.

III\. Medicine of the sky, partly true.

IV\. Imaginarily true according to man's knowledge.

V. Of middle fortune, mediocre (the Lama said: Imaginarily true, but
doubtful).

VI\. Imaginarily true, and bad by imagination.

VII\. Utterly bad.

VIII\. Likely to be bad.

IX\. A little better than the regular bad ones.

This table is consulted by the parents of the young people to be
married, who throw a sacred seed upon it;

\[1. The inscriptions had been so much injured that I could only verify
the fifth.\]

{p. 317}

the inscription of the square upon which the seed rests, is taken as the
general character of the answer as to the felicity of the ensuing
marriage, but the answer allows a variety of interpretations, according
to the birth Meba of the young people, and to the Meba of the square, if
the seed happens to rest upon a numeral and not upon the inscription.
Also the elements under which they were born, are taken into
consideration. In this respect it is universally admitted that the
circumstance, that the elements under which the young people were born
are not the same would entail discord and strife, if the element which
is superior in power were not neutralized by ceremonies which, of
course, can only be performed with efficacy by the Lamas. The relations
of the elements are detailed in the following sentences; their Tibetan
text is given in Plate. XIX., II.

"The mother of wood is water, the son of wood fire;  
"The enemy of wood is iron, the friend of wood earth;  
"The mother of water is iron, the son of water wood;  
"The enemy of water is earth, the friend of water fire;  
"The mother of iron is earth, the son of iron water;  
"The enemy of iron is fire, the friend of iron water;  
"The mother of earth is fire, the son of earth iron;  
The enemy of earth is wood, the friend of earth iron."

These notions\[1\] are evidently founded upon considerations on the
conditions of growth and decay of the existing objects; for wood, or the
plants, grow in

\[1. Comp. Pallas, 1. c., p. 236.\]

{p. 318}

the earth and are fed by water; wood furnishes the material for fire,
but wood, or trees, are felled by iron. Iron (shovels) are indispensable
for irrigation-canals, to furnish the plants (wood) with the necessary
water, of which, however, they are deprived to a certain extent by the
earth, into which a part sinks and is lost.\[1\] Fire again renders
possible the use of water for cooking, and thus increases its importance
for man.

2\. *Table with cyclic animals*.

All the tribes of Central Asia\[2\] suppose that the different natures
of the elements which constitute the cycle of twelve years, cause mutual
affection or aversity; the rules, however, which the Tibetans have
established on this head, are very arbitrary; they believe, *e. g.* that
the bird would pick the horse, &c. They speak of six varieties of
relative feelings, viz.: very great affection; mediocre affection;
indifference; disinclination; great hatred; deadly hatred. Deadly hatred
is incurable, and under such auspices young people should, properly, not
be permitted to marry; but if the parties are wealthy and liberal, the
hatred may be prevented from breaking out. All other relations of the
animals can be modified--the influence of the unfavourable weakened or
totally counteracted, that of the favourable strengthened and increased.

Diagrams in the divisions of which such groups of animals are formed,
are very frequent; their arrangement

\[1. The general dryness of the climate in Tibet makes cultivation much
more dependent upon irrigation than in nearly any inhabited part of the
globe.

2\. Comp. Pallas, 1. c., pp. 286, 263.\]

{p. 319}

is either that the head of two animals are delineated within one
division, or that their names are inscribed instead: occasionally also
an animal is ridden by a monster in human shape with the heads of one or
even more of the cyclic animals. Whether the hatred or disinclination
will become fatal to the couple, is determined by the casting of dice.

Tables of this sort had been appended to the astrological roll from
Lhassa (see p. 293).

The one which shows the combinations of animals between which feelings
of averseness very probably exist, has 36 compartments; the twelve
squares of the first two lines have the heads of the animals drawn
turned away from each other; the remainder contain their names; the

Another combination shows the animals which *may* but do not necessarily
prove unfavourable; it comprises four divisions, and in each is seen an
animal ridden by a monster with the heads of three animals. In the first
division the hog is ridden by the bird, serpent and dog; in the second
the ape by the mouse, sheep, and tiger; in the third the tiger by the
horse, ox and ape; in the fourth the serpent by the dragon, the hog and
hare. These figures are the same as those which occupy the four first
spaces of the table which is described on p. 313, as used for
consultation in cases of sickness.

V.

A SOOTHSAYING TABLE WITH NUMEROUS FIGURES AND SENTENCES.

It was but after great hesitation on the part of the Lamas that Adolphe
and Robert obtained this table at Mángnang, in Gnári Khórsum; they were
repeatedly assured that no other copy could be procured, except after
much delay, direct from Lhássa. As my brothers did not succeed in
obtaining information from the Lamas of Mángnang concerning its
application, I addressed myself to Mr. Schiefner, in order to obtain
details about analogous objects; but though he inquired with his usual
kindness about such materials, I remained limited to the translation of
the inscriptions, and, for the interpretation of the figures, to the
analogy of the forms with those on other tables.

{p. 321}

The original is 21 inches long, and 18 inches broad; its principal part
is divided into 78 rectangles which contain either a figure, or a
sentence, or both combined; some, however, are empty. Along its sides
two vertical stripes are left to receive explanatory directions for the
use of the table; of these, however, one is empty. In order to
facilitate the explanation, I give as usual the outlines of the
compartments; where a number is omitted, the space is empty.

In the translation here given the sentences, in order to the

Having arrived at the conclusion of the descriptive part of this volume,
I may be allowed to add still a few remarks, though of a general
bearing, in allusion to the contributions which the inquiries into
Buddhism have afforded for the explanation of monumental remains in
Europe, particularly in Norway, as well as for the interpretation of
ancient mythological terminology. Prof. Holmboe of Stockholm, when
comparing the tumuli and long walls extant in many parts of Norway with
the Topes in India and Afghanistan and the Chortens and Manis of Tibet,
found so many surprising analogies, that he at length declared that, in
his opinion, it is highly probable, "the teachers of Buddhism advanced
as far as Scandinavia, after having passed through the vast provinces

{p. 328}

of Russia."\[1\] And, what may be more unexpected still, even in Mexico
Buddhism was discovered to have had followers as late as the 13th
century, a circumstance made evident from the details and descriptions
contained in a Chinese author of the end of the fifteenth century of our
era concerning "the far distant land into which pious men and heavy
storms had transferred the sacred doctrine."\[2\]

\[1. For details see Holmboe, "Traces de Buddhisme en Norvège," p. 69.
Even the name of the god Odin, or Wodan, the highest god in German
mythology, Holmboe says, may be referred to Buddhist terms and to the
Sanskrit word *Budh* and its derivations *Buddha*, *Bodhin*, *Bodhân*,
*Bodhant*. The change of *b* into *v* has taken place already in
Sanskrit, and the dropping of the *v* in the ancient language of Norway
is said to be very frequent in words in which it is followed by *o* or
*u*.--A brief summary, with critical remarks, of Holmboe's book is given
by Rajendralal Mitra in Journ. As. Soc. Beng., Vol. XXVII., p. 46.

2 See Neumann, as quoted by Lassen, "Indische Alterthumskunde," Vol.
IV., p. 749.--In the United States of America, too, artificial mounds
have been found bearing such a curious analogy with the tumuli in
Norway, that it has been suggested by American antiquarians, that a
people coming from Norway discovered America already about the year 1000
of our era. Rafn, as quoted by Holmboe, p. 23.\]
