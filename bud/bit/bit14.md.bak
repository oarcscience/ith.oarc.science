# CHAPTER XI

### TRANSLATION OF AN ADDRESS TO THE BUDDHAS OF CONFESSION

TRANSLATION AND EXPLANATORY REMARKS.

IN the chapter on "Metempsychosis" I have already alluded to the various
means of purification from sins, a very efficacious one, it will be
remembered, consisting in .the supplication of the deities. I have
likewise there referred to the addresses offered up to the Buddhas of
confession, which are contained in various compilations of prayers. A
sacred treatise of this nature forms the subject of the present chapter.
The original I found concealed in a Chorten my brother Hermann had
obtained from the Lama at Saimonbóng, in Síkkim;\[1\] it is written in
small characters (the Vumed) on two sheets

\[1. The Chorten stood on the altar in the Lama's praying-room already
when Hooker was there. See the View of the interior of the house of the
Lama at Saimonbóng in his "Himalayan Journals."\]

{p. 123}

of unequal size. The larger is about four feet square, its height being
two feet four inches, its breadth one foot nine inches; the smaller has
the same breadth) but its height is only six inches, giving a surface of
7/8 square foot. These two sheets were lying one upon the other, but
separated by grains of barley interposed between them. They were wound
round a wooden four-sided obelisk which filled the central part of the
Chorten. The four sides of this obelisk were covered with Dhâranî
inscriptions.

As the size of the two sheets does not allow of my reproducing here this
invocation of the Buddhas of confession in the form. of a facsimile, I
preferred giving it transcribed in the head characters in the ordinary
form of Tibetan books, at the end of the chapter. The contents of the
two parts are separated by a distance left between them; the beginning
of the second part is besides also marked in the Tibetan text by the
recurrence of the initial sign.\[1\]

Its full title runs thus: Digpa thamchad shagpar terchoi, "Repentance of
all sins, doctrine of the hidden treasure."\[2\] The words ter-choi were
illegible in the sentence at the head of the treatise, and it was only
through their occurring at the foot of the larger leaf in connexion with
the rest of the phrase that the hiatus could be filled up. Here also the
other words preceding them had suffered considerable injury, but the
general

\[1. In the English translation the words in parenthesis are rather
explanatory paraphrases, than literal translations of the Tibetan.

2\. *S*dig-pa "sin, vice;" tham*s*-chad "all;" *b*shags-pa "repentant
confession;" *r*, the sign of the locative, is often used in stead of
the genetive {*sic*} sign (comp. Foucaux, Grain. Tib., p. 94); *g*ter "a
treasury;" chhos "the doctrine."\]

{p. 124}

context and the few letters still decipherable proved sufficient to
remove all doubt that the title had been repeated. Another name for the
petition, and one which we several times meet with in the text, is
Digshag ser chi pugri, "the golden razor which takes away sins,"\[1\]
this designation evidently signifying its extraordinary efficacy in
delivering the sinner.

The larger leaf commences with a general laudation of the Buddhas--past,
present, and to come--who are considered to have approached nearest to
perfection; then fifty-one Buddhas are mentioned each by name; of some
the region is Stated in which they dwell, to others is added the number
of their births from the moment in which they entered the Buddha career
down to the time when they obtained the Buddhaship. Sins are said to be
annihilated by reading or uttering the names of these Buddhas, and the
sins are specified from which each Buddha has the power to purify. The
wickedness of the human race, which caused the destruction of the
universe, is alluded to, and the prophecy is made that man shall have
recourse to this treatise and derive from it great advantages.

The second, smaller leaf, begins with the words: "Enshrined in the
sacred box at the time of the uttering of benedictions," which refer to
the usual inauguration ceremonies of religious buildings, as also to the
blessings pronounced on such solemn occasions. Their effects upon the
salvation of man, and the advantages

\[1. *G*ser "gold;" kyi, chi, is the sign of the genitive me; *s*pu-gri
"a razor."\]

{p. 125}

which the inhabitants of the monastery shall derive from repeating them,
are also again noticed. It concludes with four Dhâranîs.

The address styles itself a Mahâyâna Sûtra (in Tibetan, Thegpa chenpoi
do), under which we should also have to class it from the nature of its
contents.\[1\] The addressing of imaginary Buddhas and the admission of
a magical influence of prayers upon the deity implored is particularly
to be mentioned in evidence of its being written in this period of
mystic modification of Buddhism.\[2\] We may also, with equal right,
regard it as a translation from an ancient Sanskrit work, on account of
the occurring of the title in Sanskrit.

The personal names of the Buddhas, and the Tibetan terms explained in
the notes, are given in exact transliteration, and are not reprinted in
the GLOSSARY OF TIBETAN TERMS, APPENDIX B., if they occur in the text;
the native spelling of the other words may be looked for in this
Glossary.

Translation of the first part.

"In the Sanskrit language\[3\].... Reverence be to the

\[1. For the characteristic signs of a Mahâyâna Sûtra, *see* Burnouf,
"Introduction," p. 121.

2\. The Sûtras Phal-po-chhe and Rim-pa-*l*nga which are referred to for
particulars concerning several Buddhas, are contained in the Kanjur.

3\. My original is injured in this place, and the Sanskrit name cannot
be read--It is a curious custom, differing from translations in European
languages, that books which have been translated from the Sanskrit have
frequently two titles, the Sanskrit and the Tibetan one. Some larger
works of the Kanjur also receive an additional title in the Tibetan
dialect called Dulva zhi, "the basis of religious discipline." See
Csoma, "Analysis," As. Res.. Vol. XX., p. 44.\]

very spotless Buddhas, who all came, in the same way.\[1\] In Tibetan:
Repentance of all sins" (or *s*dig-pa-tham*s*-chad-*b*shags-par).

"I adore the Tathâgatas of the three periods,\[2\] who dwell in the ten
quarters of the world,\[3\] the subduers of the enemy, the very pure and
perfect Buddhas, (I adore)

\[1. In the original, Na-mo-sarva-bi-ma-la-ta-thâ-ga-ta-bud-dha; the
words are all Sankrit. {*sic*} Tathâgatas, in Tibetan De-*b*zhin, or
more fully De-*b*zhin-*g*sheg*s*-pa, an epithet of the Buddhas who have
appeared upon earth, implying that they have gone in the manner of their
predecessors. Comp. pp. 4, 15.--In the sequel I shall translate
De-*b*zhin-*g*sheg*s*-pa by its Sanskrit equivalent Tathâgata, the
literal rendering of the passage making the phrase inconveniently long.

Similar sentences begin religious treatises; the Kanjur *e. g.* has in
the first page three images representing Sâkyamuni, with his son on his
left, and one of his chief disciples on the right the following legends
being written respectively under each: "Salutation to the prince of the
Munis; salutation to the son of Shârikâ; salutation to Grachen dzin
(Sanskrit Lâhula)." The title page of the work is followed by the
Salutation to the three holy ones. Csoma, "Analysis of the Dulva class
of the Kanjur," As. Res., Vol. XX., p. 45. Our historical document
relating to the foundation of the Hímis monastery, an abreviated {*sic*}
translation of which is appended to the chapter on monasteries,
commences with the words: "Hail! praise and salutation to the teachers!"

2\. The three periods are the past, the present and the future; the
Buddhas of the past are those who had preached the law and have now
returned to Nirvâna; the Buddha of the present time is Sâkyamuni, the
last of the Buddhas that have yet appeared; the Buddhas of the future
time are the Bôdhisattvas, the candidates for Buddhaship. The Buddhas of
the three periods include all the Buddhas.

3 In Tibetan phyog*s*-*b*chu. These ten quarters of the world are:
north; north-east; east; south-east; south; south-west; west;
north-west; the quarter above the zenith; the quarter below the nadir.
Each region is inhabited by its own Buddhas and gods, and to know their
feelings towards a particular man is considered of the greatest
importance. Compare for details Chapter XVII. No. 2.--A totally
different meaning must be attached to Sa-*b*chu-pa "the ten earths," a
term equivalent to the Sanskrit Dasabhûmi, referring to the ten regions
or degrees of perfection which a Bôdhisattva has to pass in succession
in order to attain the Buddha perfection. Comp. Csoma's "Dictionary," p.
89; "Analysis," As. Res., Vol. XX., p. 469; 405. Burnouf "Introduction,"
p. 438. Wassiljew, "Der Buddhismus," p. 405.\]

my sins."

"I rejoice over the cause of virtue,\[2\] I turn the wheel of the
doctrine,\[3\] I believe that the body of all the Buddhas does not enter
Nirvâna.\[4\]

"The causes of virtue will grow to great perfection.

\[1. In Tibetan *d*pal, a title applied to gods, saints, and great men.

2\. The Tibetan word is *r*tsa-va "root, first cause, origin." The
meaning of the phrase is a promise for the practise of virtues.

3\. This is the technical term for *teaching* and *preaching* the laws
of the Buddha, though it is also applied by analogy to the *observation*
of the precepts of the Buddha. Compare Foe koue ki, Engl. Transl., pp.
29, 171.

4\. This sentence is to be explained by the dogma of the three bodies of
every Buddha, concerning which comp. p. 38. When a Buddha leaves the
earth, he loses the faculty of embodying himself again in human shape;
the Nirmânakâya body (Tib. Prulpai ku) in which he has contributed to
the welfare and salvation of mankind in the periods preceding the
attainment of the Buddha perfection, dies with him, and does not enter
Nirvâna. The Tibetan *g*sol-ba-'deb*s* had, therefore, to be translated
by "I believe," though the dictionaries only give "to intreat, to beg"
as its signification.

5\. In Tibetan *d*gra-*b*chom-pa, in Sanskrit Arhat (see p. 27).

6\. In Tibetan Yang-dag-par-*r*dzog*s*-pa, in Sanskrit Samyak sambuddha.

7\. This and the following Tibetan terms are the personal names of the
respective Buddhas.\]

where the Dyâni Buddha Amitâbha, or in Tibetan Odpagmed, sits enthroned;
it is considered the greatest reward of a virtuous life to be re-born in
this world. See the description of this region p. 98.

2\. In Sanskrit Amitâyus. This is another name of Amitâbha (Burnouf
"Introduction," p. 102) who is so styled when implored for longevity. In
images referring to this power of the Buddha, he holds a vase-like
vessel filled with the water of life, which he is believed to pour out
over those who address him.--Such a figure may be very often seen in
every kind of religious representations, paintings as well as plastic
objects.

the Dhyâni Buddha of the first human Buddha who taught the law in the
actual universe. See Burnouf's Introduction, p. 117.\]

2\. An allusion to the numerous descents of Shâkya-thub-pa, or
Sâkyamuni, the founder of Buddhism, who, in common with all candidates
for the Buddhaship previous to their final elevation, has passed through
countless probationary stages, during which period greater merit is
accumulated by most extraordinary works. The life of the Buddhas in
anterior existences is related at large in the sacred books styled
Jâtakas, not a few of these tales being identical with the fables of the
Greek Aesop. Hardy, "Manual of Buddhism," p. 100; Burnouf,
"Introduction," pp. 61, 555. The previous re-births of Sâkyamuni are in
most of the sacred books variously estimated from 500 to 550. Upham,
"History and Doctrine of Buddhism," Vol. III., p. 296; Foucaux, "Rgy
chher rol pa," Vol. II., p. 34; Hardy, "Manual," l. c. But there are
also many phrases to be met with tending to establish their infinity,
and the Buddha himself is reported to have said: "It is impossible to
reckon the bodies I have possessed." Foe koue ki, pp. 67, 348; Hodgson,
"Illustrations," p. 86. The number in the text is accordingly an
instance rather of the latter belief, and the term khrag might be an
abreviation {*sic*} from khrag-khrig, "a hundred thousand millions,"
which is also used to signify any indefinitely large number. See Csoma's
Dictionary, *voce* Khrag-khrig.\]

anterior existences.

"I adore the Buddha Mar-me-*m*dzad,\[1\] who has done so eighteen
thousand times. Once uttering this name shall purify from the sins
committed by pollution with the properties of lower men.

"I adore the Buddha Rab-tu-'bar-ba, who is known (to have been born)
16,000 times. Once uttering this name shall confer absolution, and
purify from all sins committed against parents and teachers.

"I adore the Buddha *s*Kar-*r*gyal, who has been born ten million three
thousand times. Once uttering this name shall purify from all sins
committed by polluting one's self with sacred riches.

"I adore the Buddha Padma-'phag*s*-pa, who has been born fifteen
thousand times. Once uttering this name shall purify from all sins
committed by polluting one's self with, and coveting, the riches
belonging to Chortens.\[2\]

\[1. In Sanskrit Dîpankara. This name, "the luminous" is applied to an
imaginary Buddha who, according to Turner and Hardy, is said to have
been the twenty-fourth teacher of the Buddha law previous to Sâkyamuni,
to whom he was the first to give a definite assurance of his future
Buddhaship. Turner, "Extracts from the Attakata," Journ. As. Soc. Beng.,
Vol. VIII., p. 789; Hardy's Manual, p. 94. In Hodgson's list
(Illustrations, p. 135), however, he is the first Buddha of the actual
period and the ninth predecessor of Sâkyamuni--Hardy's texts allege him
to have lived 100,000 years; the Nippon Pantheon (by Hofmann in v.
Siebold's "Beschreibung von Japan," Vol. V., p. 77) says that his stay
upon earth lasted 840 billions of years.

\[1. These are Indian priests who were very celebrated for their zeal in
the propagation of Buddhism; with the exception of Lugrub, the first of
this series, they all took an active part in spreading its doctrines
throughout Tibet. Lugrub, in Sanskrit Nâgârjuna, is regarded as the
founder of the Mahâyâna system. See p. 30. Guru Padma is the famous
teacher Padma Sambhava, who was sent for by king Thisrong de tsan, and
is said to have reached Tibet A.D. 747. Bimala mitra also came to Tibet
in accordance, with an invitation from this king. See Schmidt in
"Ssanang Ssetsen," p. 356. Na-ro-va, who is enumerated before Bimala
mitra, must doubtless have been contemporaneous with him and Padma
Sambhava. Pandita Atisha, the last of the series, has a great reputation
for re-establishing Buddhism after the persecutions of its followers
under the reigns of Langdharma and big successors (902-71).

2\. The Tibetan *b*la-ma-dam-pa-*b*rgyud, is an honorary title applied
to the priests with whom originated a specific system of Buddhism. In a
subsequent sentence, and also in the document relating to the foundation
of the Hímis monastery, we shall find them called "Foundation-Lamas," in
Tibetan *r*tsa-va'i-*b*la-ma.

3\. In Tibetan *b*skal-ba-*s*nyig-ma, According to the notions of the
Buddhists, as well as of the Brahmans, the universe, which is without
beginning or end, is periodically destroyed and constructed again, these
revolutions passing through four different periods, or Kalpas, viz.: the
periods of formation, and of the continuance of formation; and those of
the destruction, and disappearance of the universe, Here the Kalpa of
destruction is referred to, and it is foretold that man shall obtain
absolution from his sins by reading this book. The universe is dissolved
and consumed by the powers of fire, water, and wind, which effect its
entire destruction in sixty-four attacks upon its substance. The moral
condition of man previous to the several agencies coming into action is
stated as follows: "Before the destruction by water, cruelty or violence
prevails in the world; before that by fire, licentiousness, and before
that by wind, ignorance. When licentiousness has prevailed, men are cut
off by disease; when violence, by turning their weapons against each
other, and when ignorance, by famine." Hardy, "Manual of Buddhism," pp.
28-35; Schmidt, Mém. de l'Acad. de Pétersb., Vol. II., pp. 58-68.\]

mercy,\[1\] men shall cut stuffs woven of cotton, and work it, when cut,
to garments; when there they take meat; when there they buy and trade
with goods; when the Gelongs\[2\] break down inhabited places; when the
astrologers\[3\] invoke good fortune;\[4\] when the Bonpo\[5\] carry
with them (listen to) the secret mystical sentences (Dhârânîs); when the
Gebshi are the commanders in

\[1. This phrase is to be understood m a sort of prediction that the
temples shall be desecrated by worldly negociations; {*sic*} for it is
in the temples that are put up the three representatives (Tibetan
Tensumni) of the Buddha, his precepts, and his mercy.

The Buddha is figured as a statue, a bas-relief, or a picture. The
pictures hang down from the cross-beams of the roof, or are traced on
the walls; the statues and bas-reliefs show him in a sitting attitude,
and are placed behind the altar in a recess. The precepts which he
bequeathed to man after his departure from earth, are symbolized by a
book, which lies upon a lower step of the altar, or rests upon a shelf
suspended from the roof. His mercy, or unlimited charity, which enabled
him to obtain the sublime rank of a Buddha, in order to lead man to
salvation, is signified by a Chorten, a pyramidal chest containing
relies, which always occupies a prominent place upon the altar. See
Csoma, "Grammar" p. 173, "Dictionary," *voce* *r*ten;--also Schmidt's
Lexicon. For further details about images of gods see Chapter XIV.; for
books, see p. 80; Chortens, Chapter XIII. For the place which these
objects occupy in temples, I may refer to the Chapter on the temples,
and to the view of the interior of the temple at Mangnáng, in Gnári
Khórsum, by my brother Adolphe in the Atlas to the "Results of a
Scientific Mission."

2\. The term *d*ge-slong is applied to ordained priests, who, however,
are generally called by the more honourable title of Lama (*b*la-ma), a
distinction strictly belonging only to the superiors of convents. The
Gelongs must not care for riches or worldly prosperity; their breaking
down inhabited places may mean, perhaps, their fighting against other
monasteries or against rich men in general.

3\. In Tibetan *s*ngag*s*-pa, *one versed in charms*.

4\. In Tibetan *g*yang-'gug*s*; a ceremony of this nature will be
noticed in a subsequent chapter. The allusion here is to the abuse of it
as a substitute for prayers.

closest manner to the superstitious ideas transferred from the earlier
Tibetan creed; comp. p. 74.\]

themselves with their daughters-in-law; when men destroy (eat) the meat
destined for the manes of the dead; when the head Lamas eat the meat
prepared for offerings;\[4\] when men cut themselves off from the vital
principle (commit suicide\[5\]); when bad actions increase upon earth;
when the song Mani shall be returned in answer;\[6\] when the calves of

goods of others; when the saints\[8\] travel and establish trade;

\[1. *D*ge-*b*shes, abreviated from *d*ge-bai-*b*shes-*g*nyen, in
Sanskrit Kalyânamitra, meaning a learned priest, a friend to virtue. It
is hardly necessary to say that the functions of a military chief do not
agree very well with the clerical character.

2\. The priests are not allowed to have intercourse with women, but the
violation of this precept is but too probable by their dwelling under
the same roof with nuns.

3\. Zhang, "a maternal-uncle;" *b*lon, "a magistrate, an officer, a
nobleman;" the two words in connexion designate a man of superior rank.

4\. The Tibetan has zan, which is explained in the dictionaries as
"meat, a kind of thick potage, dough, or paste made of the meal or flour
of parched grains." As an instance of its use for food in general see
the details in Hermann's "Glossary," *s. v.* Zánkhar, in Vol. III., of
the "Results," &c., and R. A. Soc., 1862.

5\. Deliverance from existence is only the consequence of good actions;
but suicide is also in the opinion of the Buddhist a bad action, and has
a re-birth in a lower degree as one of its consequences, since the sins
for the expiation of which the present existence had to be endured, are
not yet atoned for, and also a new crime is committed. In the period of
misery alluded to in the text, however, also this moral law will be
overlooked.

6\. By Mani the famous six-syllable prayer Om mani padme hum, "O, the
Jewel in the Lotus: Amen," is to be understood; this allusion in the
text refers to its conversion into a popular song.

7\. *m*Dzo, a mixed breed, the offspring of a Yak (*bos gruniens*) and a
common common {*sic*} Indian Zhebu cow; in the language of the Himálaya
tribes it is called Chubu. The Dzos are one of the few mixed species
which are capable of propagation, and they outnumber in some valleys the
pare Yaks.

8\. In Tibetan nal-jor, in Sanskrit Yogâchârya, "a saint, a devotee," is
also the name of a religious sect, which enjoyed the most favour in
India until the seventh century A.D.--Respecting its history and
religious tenets, see Chapter V.\]

existence; when there shall be no more gratuities; when the time shall
arrive that old customs are disturbed (changed); when men shall be given
up to the ravages of war and the enemy; when frost, hail, and drought

remaining to give a clue to the meaning.

discord and dispute among the inhabitants of this monastery\[1\] shall
be taken away through them.

"These blessings, if recited on the 8th, 15th, and 30th of every month,
purify most surely from the five great crimes,\[2\] and from all sins,
and deliver from the six kinds of hell. The 84,000 great emblems of the
essence of the sublime doctrine shall be the same with every being.\[3\]
The mind of man shall become unchangeably directed towards attaining the
sanctity of a Buddha; he shall gain the energetic will of the Buddha,

\[1. The name of the monastery is not given in the original, which only
says, *d*gon-pa "a monastery".

2\. The five great crimes of the Buddhists are: 1. The taking of life;
2. Theft; 3. Adultery; 4. Lying; 5. Drunkenness. See Burnouf, "Lotus de
la Bonne Loi," p. 447; Hardy, "Manual of Buddhism," Chapter X., p. 488.

3\. This phrase refers, as may be seen from the sequel, to the inferior
signs of a Buddha's beauty. They are generally stated to be 80 in
number, but other books, as *e. g.* the Rgya-chher-rol-pa (translated by
Foucaux, Vol. II., p. 108) give 84, which, in the present treatise, have
been multiplied by 1000. The number of 84,000 is a most favourite one in
Buddhist cosmogony and seems to he used in the same way as Khrag-khrig,
"a hundred thousand millions" (p. 130), and the Chinese Wan, or 10,000
(Ideler, "Ueber die Zeitrechnung der Chinesen," p. 10), as the
designation of an infinite number. The extent, thickness, and diameter
of the sakwalas can always be divided by 8; the prolongation of the age
of mankind continues for 84,000 years. See Hardy, "Manual," Chapter I.;
Foe koue ki, p. 127.\]

(Three Dhâranîs, in corrupt Sanskrit, now follow. The first Dhâranî is a
mystic invocation of Dorjesempa, Sanskrit Vajrasattva, (see p. 50); in
the second Dhâranî is condensed the belief in the four truths (see p.
16); the third Dhâranî is recited at the inauguration of the temples;
now the: text continues:\[1\]

"By means of these invocations the creatures become perfect in the two
collections;\[2\] they shall be purified from their sins and blessed
with the dignity of a most perfect Buddha.

(A fourth Dhâranî follows).

"This (Dhâranî) is raised (granted) as a favour' to the wanderers in the
orb for not having paid reverence to parents-instead of thankfully
remembering favours received--nor to the holy Foundation-Lamas,\[4\] who
have obtained perfection by virtues.

"All sins committed by taking life, together with the transgressions
accumulated in previous existences, the sins of lying, envy, and
wickedness which proceed from the mind--all these sins, are abolished by
this sublime doctrine.
