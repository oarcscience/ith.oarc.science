Reports of European Travellers.

By Lamaism Europeans designate that peculiar form of Buddhism which
developed itself from Tsonkhapa's institutions in Tíbet and soon spread
over all Central Asia, where it took deep root. Our knowledge of this
most modern form of Buddhism is also of no long date; for to penetrate
into Tíbet was always a matter of great difficulty, both on account of
the impediments presented by the general great elevation of the country,
as also by the jealous and hostile feelings of the natives towards
foreigners. The supremacy gradually obtained by the Chinese Government
has but increased the difficulty;

{p. 146}

even quite recently it has proved its hostile disposition,
notwithstanding the treaties signed after the last war in China.\[1\]

The first Europeans who penetrated into Tibet were Christian
missionaries. In the year 1624 a Jesuit, Pater Antonio de Andrada,
travelled as far as Cbábrang, the capital of the Gúge district of Gnári
Khórsum, the Raja, or Gyalpo, of which was very favourably inclined
towards him. The first who reached Lhássa, the centre of the Lamaic
church, were the Jesuits Albert Dorville and Johann Gruber, who, in
1661, returned from China viâ Tibet and Hindostán to Europe. The next
who followed them were the Capucine patres Josepho de Asculi and
Francisco Maria de Toun, who started from Bengál in the year 1706 and
safely reached Lhássa. In 1716 the Jesuit Desideri again penetrated up
to Lhássa from the west, through Kashmír and Ladák. The most important
event for our knowledge of Tibetan Buddhism was the Capucine mission
under the superintendance of Horacio de la Penna., who, with five
companions, arrived at Lhássa in the year 1741; their efforts to
propagate the Christian faith had but little success, though they were
kindly received by the Tibetan authorities. They collected much valuable
information concerning the geography of the country and the history,
religion, manners and customs of the inhabitants. Horacio de la Penna
was particularly distinguished by an ardent zeal in the cause of
Christianity;

\[1. I allude to the case of Capt. Smyth, for whom no passports could be
obtained; and of, Capt. Blackiston, who was obliged to return in the
first weeks after his setting out from the shores of China to reach
Tibet through China.\]

{p. 147}

he translated into Tibetan a catechism of the Christian faith, the
Doctrina Christiana of Cardinal Belarmino, the Thesaurus Doctrinæ
Christianæ of Turlot, and he also compiled a Tibetan-Italian dictionary.
The materials brought home by this mission, which a few years afterwards
was obliged to leave Lhássa, were examined by Pater Antonio Georgi, who
in his curious "Alphabetum Tibetanum," Romæ 1762, undertook to prove by
comparative philology the opinion entertained by the missionaries, that
Lamaism was a corrupted form of Christianity.

In the year 1811 Manning, according to Princep, made an attempt to pass
through Tibet into China; but he was stopped at Lhássa, and not being
permitted to go any farther, he was obliged to turn back.\[1\] In 1845
two Lazarist missionaries, Huc and Gabet, again reached Lhássa from
Mongolia; but after a short stay, they also had to leave this capital,
and were escorted to Macao by a Chinese officer.

Since the commencement of this century various journeys have been
undertaken into Bhután, Síkkim, and the western districts adjoining the
British territories. Particularly precious are also the publications of
Pallas,

\[1. Ritter, "Die Erdkunde von Asien," Vol. II., pp. 439-64. H. Princep,
"Tibet, Tartary and Mongolia," London 1&52, p. 17. For an interesting
collection of the views of various missionaries on this subject see
Marsden's note to "Marco Polo's Travels," p. 240. The Popes had hoped
the Capucine mission would prove of very great importance for the
propagation of Christianity in Central Asia, and had supported them in
every way. Pope Clemens IX. issued a particular Breve concerning Tibet
(Ritter, 1. c., p. 459), and the nomination of a Vicarius apostolicus
for Lhássa still takes place. The "Annuario Pontificio," Roma 1862, p.
243, gives as the gentleman in charge of this office Monsignors Giacomo
Leone Thomine Demazures, nominated March 27, 1846; he is at the same
time the Bishop in *partibus infidelium* of Sinopolis in Cilicia.\]

{p. 148}

detailing the information obtained by him in Russian Mongolia; and those
of Klaproth--his translation of the description of Tibet by a Chinese
officer, as well as the results of his investigations connected with his
travels in the regions of the Kaukasus. All the various narratives treat
principally of the hierarchical system, the regulations and social
habits of the clergy and the religious establishments; the notices on
religious ceremonies are very rare. In addition to the above-mentioned
sources of information, which have been laid under contribution in my
endeavour to define, in the following chapters, the nature and
characteristics of the Tibetan priesthood and the institutions connected
therewith, I have also been enabled to turn to good account the
observations made. by my brothers during their travels in the Eastern
Himálaya and in Central and Western Tibet, in the years 1855 to 1857.

Fundamental laws.

It is very probable that in the earliest periods of Buddhism all those
who embraced this religion, abandoned the world and assisted their
master, as much as lay in their power, in propagating. his faith. Those
who, after having heard Sâkyamuni explain his doctrines, desired to
become Buddhists, were first obliged to make an explicit. declaration to
that effect, whereupon the teacher proceeded to cut off their hair and
beard, and then invested them with the religious garments, whereby they
were received into the community of the faithful. Later,

{p. 149}

when the number of Buddhists had increased) the neophite {*sic*} was
placed for instruction under the charge of an elder disciple, a practice
which became general after Sâkyamuni's death. The distinction between
lay brothers and priests, and the important dogma that only the latter,
as having renounced the world, can obtain Nirvâna, was certainly not
introduced till after Sâkyamuni's death, although he himself had
recognized *mendicants*, the receivers of alms, who are forbidden to eat
other food than that which has been received under certain conditions
(one being that it has been given in the form of alms); and
*householders*, the givers of alms, who thereby gain merit; but by him
both these classes were admitted with equal rights to the advantages
promised to his followers. But already the earlier schools (the Hînayâna
sect) excluded lay brothers from attaining to the perfection of an
Arhat, and to Nirvâna; the Mahâyâna system admits them, but the present
sects of Tibet again raised that strongly marked barrier between the
laity and the priests, denying to the former the possibility of
attaining to the rank of a Buddha; they may attain Nirvâna, but they
cannot become "a blessing to the world."\[1\] The ascetics are styled in
the sacred books Bhikshus, Sramanas, Srâvakas, Arhats; and the lay
followers, the devotees, Upâsakas (in Tibetan Genyen); in the Mahâyâna
Sûtras the latter are also called "Bôdhisattvas who reside in their
houses," the former "Bôdhisattvas who have renounced the world."

\[1. See pp. 27, 38, 106. Compare also Hodgson, "Illustrations," p. 98.
Hardy, "Eastern Monachism," p. 12.\]

{p. 150}

The early disciples of Sâkyamuni are generally represented as wandering
about with their royal master; others, in consequence of his frequent
exhortations to lead a solitary life, are said to have retired to the
forests and woods which surround the settlements, or to have lived in
solitary and forsaken houses, which they only left on certain periods in
order to betake themselves to Sâkyamuni and listen to his words. Large
regular assemblies, which probably date back as far as Sâkyamuni
himself, took place when the rainy season was over; during the rains
Sâkyamuni himself, as well as his immediate followers and the
hermit-disciples, had taken up their abode in the houses of
well-intentioned persons,, and had devoted themselves to meditations on
such parts of the doctrine as they had not yet clearly understood; they
also employed part of their time in the instruction of their
entertainers, At the assemblies above mentioned the Bhikshus reported
their success in gaining neophites, discussed various dogmas, and
requested a solution of any doubts with which they may have been
troubled.

Originally such assemblies were held in the open air; the Vihâras, in
the sense of monasteries, in which they might otherwise have taken
place, did not come into existence till a much later period. The word
Vihâra, according to its etymological derivation, denotes a place where
the Buddhists assembled; and it is in this sense that this term is used
in the Sûtras, or books considered to contain the words of Sâkyamuni,
which always begin thus: "When Sâkya happened to be (viharati sma) at a
place;"

{p. 151}

but later this name was applied to those houses in which the priests
met, and where strangers and the ascetics (who went about collecting
alms) found an asylum. The meaning of the word became more restricted
still, and was subsequently given to monasteries only, or to those
religious establishments, in which those who once enter them are bound
to remain for life. It is impossible to determine exactly the various
periods during which Vihâras took the form of meeting-houses or, later,
of monasteries. In the Hînayâna books on discipline they are mentioned
only as an appendix to the chapter on the seats, and they were probably
erected later than the temples, the first of which is said to have been
built in the period of Upagupta, who lived in the third century B.C. The
violent attacks of the Brahmans must soon have convinced the Buddhist
clergy of the advantages to be derived from association; rules were then
drawn up for life in community and for subordination, and the beginning
of monastic institutions was thus made, which latter were, however, in
India, even in their final perfection, widely different from those of
Tibetan monachism at the present day. In earlier times each Vihâra had
its own administration and its own chief, and was independent of the
others; and it was so even in the seventh century, when Hiuen Thsang
resided in India; a hierarchy so thoroughly organized as we now find in
Tibet, was never. known in India.\[1\]

\[1. See Burnouf,,introduction," pp. 232 seq., 279 seq., 286; Hardy,
"Eastern Monachism," Chapter III., IV., XIII.; Wassiljew, "Der
Buddhismus," pp. 45, 96. Compare also Barthélmy St. Hilaire, "Le Bouddha
{footnote p. 152} et sa religion," p. 299. Wilson, "Buddha and
Buddhism," p. 251. The principal cave temples were probably excavated in
the period from the commencement of the Christian era to the fifth
century after it. It needs hardly be added that the sacred books which
represent Sâkyamuni himself to have felt the necessity of instituting
head priests are interpolated.\]

{p. 152}

Hierarchical System.

The first organisation of the Tibetan clergy dates from King Thisrong de
tsan (728-86 A.D.), of whom the Bodhimör says that "he gave the clergy a
fir m constitution and divided it into classes."\[1\] But the
development of the present hierarchical system, which was independent of
these ancient institutions, dates from the fifteenth century. In 1417
the famous Lama Tsonkhapa founded the Gáldan monastery at Lhássa, and
became its superior; the great authority and reputation he had enjoyed,
devolved upon his successors in the abbotship of this monastery, who,
down to the present day, are believed to have been men of particular
sanctity. But these abbots were soon superseded in influence by the
Dalai Lama\[2\] at Lhassa (now the highest in rank of the Tibetan
priesthood), and by the Panchen Rinpoche at Tashilhúnpo,\[3\] who are
both considered to be of divine

\[1. Schmidt, "Ssanang Ssetsen," p. 356; comp. p. 67.

2\. Dalai Lama is the title which the Mongolians give to him; Dalai is a
Mongolian word meaning *ocean*, Lama or correctly *b*lama, is the
Tibetan word for a *superior*. Schott, "Ueber den Buddhaismus in
Hochasien," p. 32. The Europeans became familiar with this term from the
work's of Georgi, Pallas and Klaproth.

3\. Tashilhúnpo, or in exact transliteration: "*b*khra shis lhun po," is
the neighbouring city of chiefly ecclesiastical establishments, about a
mile to the south east of Digárchi, "the four-housed (top?)" (in Tibetan
written *b*zhi-ka-*r*tse, in Nevari zhi-kha-chhen), the capital of the
province Tsang, of Chinese Tibet. See the map of Turner, "Embassy;"

origin, and are, consequently, regarded more in the light of gods than
of mortal beings. This assumed divine origin gives them a character
totally different from that of the Pope of the Roman Catholic church;
but then, on the other hand, neither of them has such a widely-spread
acknowledged supremacy as that enjoyed by the Pope of Rome.

The *Dalai Lama* is viewed as an incarnation of the Dhyâni Bôdhisattva
Chenresi, who is supposed to effect his re-incorporation by a beam of
light which issues from his body and enters the individual whom he
selects for his re-descent.\[1\] The *Panchen Rinpoche* is considered to
be an incarnation of Chenresi's celestial father, Amitâbha.\[2\] There
is a story relating that Tsonkhapa himself had ordered his two principal
disciples to take upon themselves a mortal form in an uninterrupted
series of rebirths, and to watch over the propagation of, the Buddhist
faith and the maintenance of its purity;\[3\] and according to this
account, it was Tsonkhapa who created these two principal clerical
dignities. But we learn from Csoma's Chronological Tables, that Gedun
Grub (born 1389 A.D. died 1473) was the first, who assumed the title of
Gyelva Rinpoche, "His precious Majesty," which is applied to the Dalai
Lama only; Gedun Grub is, therefore, to be considered the first Dalai
Lama, and not the Dharma Rinchen, the successor of Tsonkhapa in the
chair of the Gáldan monastery. In the year 1445 he

3\. "Arbeiten der russ. Mission in Peking," Vol. I, p. 316.\]

{p. 154}

also built the large monastery of Tashilúnpo, whose abbots assumed the
title of Panchen Rinpoche, "the great teacher-jewel," and who claimed
with much success the same divine nature and temporal power as that till
then enjoyed by the Dalai Lama alone. He shares an equal authority and
sovereignty as the Dalai Lama, but in ecclesiastical affairs, even in
his own territories, his words are considered less divine, his faculties
inferior to those of the Dalai Lama.

The fifth Gyelva Rinpoche, Ngagvang Lobzang Gyamtso, a most ambitious
man, sent to the Koshot Mongolians, who had settled in the environs of
the lake Kuku Nor, and requested their assistance against the Tibetan
king then residing at Digárchi, with whom he was at war. The Mongolians
conquered Tibet, and are said to have made a present of the same to
Ngagvang Lobzang. This event took place in the year 1640, and it is from
this moment that we must date the extension of the *temporal government*
of the Dalai Lamas over all Tibet.'

The Dalai Lamas are elected by the clergy, and up to the year 1792 these
elections had taken place uninfluenced by the Chinese government; but
since this time the court of Pekin, to whom the Dalai Lama is a very
important personage in a political as well as a religious point of view,
has taken care that the sons of such persons

\[1. Csoma, "Grammar," pp. 192, 198. Ritter, "Asien," Vol. III., pp.
274-86. Köppen, "Die Rel. d. Buddha," Vol. II., pp. 129-52. Cunningham,
"Ladak," p. 389, has understood Csoma's account as if in the year 1640
the first Dalai Lama had been established, but Csoma decidedly only
alludes to the uniting of the temporal government with his
ecclesiastical sovereignity. {sic}\]

{p. 155}

only as are known for their loyality {*sic*} and fidelity shall be
elected to this high dignity.\[1\]

The next in rank to these sublime Lamas are the superiors of several
larger monasteries, of whom some are considered as incarnations, others
as common mortals; in either case head Lamas of so high a rank are
styled Khanpos.\[2\] My brothers saw Khanpos at the monasteries of Láma
Yúru in Ladák, and at Thóling, in Gnári Khórsum. They were natives of
Lhássa, and had been appointed by the Dalai Lama's government for
periods of from three to six years, at the expiration of which time they
would return to Lhássa. The abbots in smaller monasteries are elected
for life by the monks; but the election has to be submitted for approval
to the Dalai Lama, who can either sanction or reject it.

Other persons superior in rank to the common monks are the Budzad, the
superintendent of the choral songs and music during the divine service;
and the Gebkoi, who has to maintain discipline and order. These
dignitaries are also elected by the monks, and constitute, with the
abbot, the council which regulates the affairs of the monastery. Some
other dignities which are occasionally

\[1. Compare for details Hue, "Souvenirs," Vol. I., p. 292. Köppen, 1.
c., p. 247.

2\. In Bhután the incarnated Khanpos had profited by political
circumstances to make themselves independent of the Dalai Lama. The
relations between the ruler of Bhután proper, the Dharma Rinpoche
(called by the Hindus Dharma Râja), and Lhássa seem to be very loose;
and the abbots of the monasteries in the southern valleys have also set
up principalities almost independent of the Dharma Rinpoche. These
Lamas, styled Lama Rajas by Hermann's companions, are very jealous of
their power, and endeavoured most energically {*sic*} to prevent Hermann
from entering Bhután, by abducting his servants.\]

{p. 156}

found in larger monasteries are mere posts of honour, having no direct
influence upon the administration.\[1\]

The title of Lama, written in Tibetan *b*lama, is applied by right to
the superior priests only; but just as the Arabic word Sheikh, and other
titles of honour and rank in European languages, so also the word Lama
has come to be regarded as a title which courtesy requires one to give
to every Buddhist priest.\[2\]

A particular class of Lamas are the astrologers, the Tsikhan
(occasionally also styled Kartsi-pa, or Chakhan = fortune-teller, Ngagpa
= one expert in charms), who are allowed to marry and to wear a peculiar
phantastic dress. These people are professional fortune-tellers, who are
officially authorized to conjure and to exorcise evil spirits, on behalf
of and to the profit of the clergy. Common tricks, such as vomiting
fire, swallowing knives, &c., are not openly practised, nor would they
be allowed, though in other things these conjurers are permitted to play
upon the credulity of the ignorant multitude to any extent, and derive
as much profit therefrom, as they can. The instruments which they most
frequently employ in their incantations, are an arrow and a triangle
upon which supposed talismanic sentences are inscribed.\[3\] Amongst
these astrologers, the Lamas called Choichong, who are said to be all
educated at the Garmakhyá monastery at

\[1. Compare Pallas, "Mongol. Völker," Vol. II., pp. 117-37. Hue,
"Souvenirs," p. 297.

2\. Compare Hardy, "Eastern Monachism," p. 11. Gerard, "Koonawur," p.
119, states that he heard the head priests of the monasteries styled
Gelong or Guru.

3\. For particulars concerning certain ceremonies in which these things
are used, see Chapter XV.\]

{p. 157}

Lhássa, enjoy the greatest reputation, because the god Choichong, or
Choichong gyalpo, is supposed to become incorporated in one of the Lamas
belonging to this monastery as often as he descends upon earth. His
re-descent becomes manifest by the frequency of miraculous deeds
performed by a Lama, who is then considered as the favourite instrument
chosen by king Choichong. He soon becomes the object of universal
worship, which is most lucrative to the monastery; for Buddhists from
all parts of High Asia come as pilgrims to Lhássa to receive his
benediction; and they consider themselves happy if the valuable presents
they offer as an equivalent, are accepted by the incarnate
Choichong.--In the monasteries beyond Tibet Choichong astrologers are
not frequent; and though the images of king Choichong are met with in
most monasteries of Western Tibet and the Himálaya, my brothers never
saw a Lama Choichong.\[1\]

The god Choichong is but one of the "five great kings," in Tibetan Ku.
nga gyalpo. These five mythological persons are considered to protect
man most efficaciously against the evil spirits and enable him also to
attain the accomplishment of every wish. Their names are Bihar gyalpo;
Choichong gyalpo; Dalha gyalpo; Luvang gyalpo; Tokchoi gyalpo. Of Bihar
I know particularly that he has chosen the protection of monasteries

\[1. Compare 'Description du Tubet," Nouv. Journ. As., Vol. IV., pp.
240, 293. The offerings which are the most agreeable to these kings, and
the conditions under which they are to be presented, are detailed in the
Tibetan book entitled Ku nga gyalpoi kang shag, "to make confession to
the live great kings." Of Choichong in particular treats the book Prulku
choichong chenpoi Kang shag 'to make confession to the incarnation of
the great Choichong."\]

{p. 158}

and religious establishments; of Dalha that he is the tutelary god of
warriors. The images of the five gods are very generally met with in
temples and in the private praying-room of laymen: amulet-boxes also not
unfrequently contain such representations. They are also added to an
image of the thirty-five Buddhas of confession (see p. 97), in which
they are drawn riding phantastic animals. Bihar is riding a red tiger;
Choichong a yellow lion; Dalha a yellow horse (Khyang); Luvang, the god
of the Nâgas (see p. 31), a blue crocodile; Tockchoi a yellow deer. In
other pictures, in which one of these gods is the *principal* object,
this very one is drawn on a larger scale than the surrounding figures.
Such a picture, bought by Adolphe at Mángnang, in Gnári Khórsum, shows
Choichong extremely fat and three-headed, riding a white lion with a
blue mane; the figure is surrounded by flames." His-side heads are blue
and crimson, the central one is, like the body, of flesh-colour. His
broad hat and some arms, the symbols of his activity, are gilt; his
dress is a tiger's skin; of which the feet are tied round his neck. In
the upper part of the picture various domestic animals are sketched,
alluding to the great merit to be derived from consecrating to him an
animal, which then is no more allowed to be killed for private use, but
after some time is delivered to the Lamas, who may eat it. Below him are
traced three other defenders of man against the mischievous spirits,
viz.: Damchan dorje legpa, riding on a camel; Tsangpa, in Sanskrit
Brahma (see p. 114), riding a ram; Chebu damchan, riding a goat.

{p. 159}

Organization of the clergy.

The principles of its Constitution. The number of observances to be
followed, at the present day, by the Lamas, has increased, from precepts
plain and brief, to an ample code of laws, which contains two hundred
and fifty rules, in Tibetan Khrims: they are detailed in the first, or
Dulva division of the Kanjur, and have been explained in the well-known
works of Hardy and Burnouf.\[1\] But of this mass of precepts, I direct
the attention chiefly to those of celibacy and poverty (which Tsonkhapa
enacted anew), because they have been of great importance in forming the
present character of the Tibetan priesthood.

The violation of the ordinance of celibacy, or even sexual intercourse,
is severely punished; nevertheless it is not unfrequent, particularly in
the case of Lamas who do not live in the monasteries. Besides, we know
of two instances in which, from considerations of public interest, the
Dalai Lama has granted indulgences to marry to Lamas of royal pedigree.
The one instance is reported by Dr. Campbell, who says that a prince of
Síkkim obtained this permission; another analogous case is noticed by
Moorcroft concerning the Râja of Ladák.\[1\] The vow of

{p. 160}

poverty is one of those institutions which seriously affect the public
welfare in Tibet, as the monks, so very numerous in every Buddhist
country, have to live from the contributions of the lay population.
Though the single Lama who has renounced the world is not allowed to
possess any thing besides the articles permitted by the code of
discipline, the Lama convents may possess landed property, houses, and
treasures, and its members may enjoy the abundance of its well-filled
store-houses.

The *revenues* are derived from the collecting of alms, from voluntary
offerings, from the remunerations for the performance of sacred rites,
from the rents of properties, and even from commercial enterprises.

Alms are more particularly collected at harvest time, when a number of
Lamas are deputed to visit the villages for the purpose of begging for
grain. When Hermann was at Hímis (in Sept. 1856) more than one half of
the Lamas were out in the country. Of voluntary offerings the most
considerable are those presented to an. incarnated Lama, or given at the
annual festivals.\[1\] The greater number of smaller ones are obtained
by those monasteries. Situated along the principal passages over the
mountains, as it is the custom for every traveller to repeat some
prayers in the temples he meets with, and to leave a small present. The
remunerations for attending at births, marriages, illnesses, death, &c.,
are generally regulated by the officiating priest himself in proportion
to the means of those requiring their service. These consist generally
in natural products, which appear

\[1. See an example in Turner's Embassy, p. 345.\]

{p. 161}

to be given in advance.\[1\] The landed property, which is sometimes
even very considerable, is either tilled by the dependents, or is let at
a high price. The making and selling of images, charms, &c., is another
source of considerable income for every Lama; their trading with wool,
and in Eastern Tibet with musk, is mentioned by several travellers.\[2\]

Grades amongst the Lamas. In Tibet the clergy, besides living at the
public expense, are also in most districts free from taxes\[3\] and
contributions for public works; and it is on account of these and other
advantages that the condition and dignity of a Lama are every where so
sought after. It is the custom in Eastern, as well as in Western Tibet,
to make the elder son of a family a Lama, and restrictive regulations,
analogous to those mentioned in the ancient religious books, seem to
have lost their force; for all travellers report that any one can become
a member of the religious order; the only restriction I know of is this,
that in Bhután the father who wishes his son to be received as a novice
must ask the permission of the Deba and the Dharma Raja, and pay a fee
of 100 Deba rupees.\[4\] When any one declares his wish to enter the
priesthood, or when he desires to make his son a Lama, the faculties of
the novice are examined. In most cases the novices

\[1. As an instance of this custom I mention the ceremonies connected
with the driving away of the evil spirits from the burial-ground (see
chapter XV., No. 9). See also Hue, "Souvenirs," Vol. II., p. 121.

are boys, and if they are found intelligent enough, they are allowed to
take the vows (Tib. Dom), viz. to observe the religious duties connected
with the priesthood; and then they become "candidates for orders,"
Genyen (an equivalent to the Sanskrit Upâsaka).\[1\] The Lamas who have
charge of the instruction of the novices, seem not always to treat their
scholars well, for several travellers have witnessed rudeness and even
cruelty in punishments.\[2\] The grade next to the Genyen is that of
Getsul; an ordinated priest is styled a Gelong; the grades are conferred
by a council, before which the candidate has to prove in a public
disputation his experience in the sciences he has been taught
hitherto.\[3\]

Women are also allowed to embrace the monastic life, and we read of
female mendicants, the Bhikshunîs, who have devoted themselves already
in the earliest youth of Buddhism with the permission of the founder to
an ascetic life. The nuns are styled Gelong-ma in Tibetan; in Western
Tibet, however, and in the Himálaya they cannot be very numerous, for my
brothers never saw any great number of them.\[4\]

The clergy are monastic; the greater part of the priests reside in
monasteries, others are allowed to live as clergymen in the villages for
the convenience of the population, who so frequently require their
assistance.

{p. 163} Hermits also, are not rare: they inhabit the highest parts of
the valleys, and live from the charity of passersby. It is
characteristic of them that they allow the hair and beard to grow; and
the custom. is so general that the typical representation of a hermit is
always that of a man with long uncut hair and beard. Each chooses a
particular rite, and believes he derives from the frequent practice of
the same supernatural assistance. A rite very often selected, though I
am unable to state for what reason, is that of Chod, "to cut, or
destroy," the meaning of which is anxiously kept a profound secret by
the Lamas. The recluses are believed to be exposed to repeated attacks
on the part of the evil spirits, the enemies of earnest and assiduous
meditation; but the beating of a drum is regarded as a most efficacious
means of keeping them at a distance.\[1\]

On certain days those isolated Lamas, the village priests as well as
anachorites, {*sic*} are required to revisit the respective

Csoma and Schmidt's Dictionaries. In pictorial representations of a
recluse a drum is a frequent object in one of his hands, while the other
very generally holds a cord, typifying the wisdom granted him by the
deity as a reward for his strong mind and perseverance.--With reference
to the encouragement given by Buddhism in its early days to
anachoretism, I wish to remark (see also p. 6, 150) that Sâkyamuni
himself, as well as all the founders and supporters of the various
systems of Buddhism, urgently exhorted to energy in the practise of
meditation, as the most efficacious means of becoming emancipated from
existence; and that they recommended for these religious exercises the
choice of out-of-the-way places little likely to be visited by any one
in pursuit of worldly pleasure or gratification. Sâkyamuni himself had
set the example by retiring to remote places previous to obtaining the
Buddhaship, and it was not only duly followed by his early adherents,
but is also practised by the modern Tibetans.\]

monasteries to which they belong; and they are punished if they fail to
present themselves to submit to this sort of control. In every monastery
there is a list of all the monks forming part of the clerical
community.\[1\]

Number of Lamas. With reference to the number of Lamas I here present
the following data.

For Eastern Tibet Dr. Campbell gives a list of twelve principal convents
at *Lhássa* and in its vicinity, inhabited by a total of 18,500
Lamas.\[2\] Surprising as this number is, it is far from representing
the entire number of Lamas spread over all the country of Eastern Tibet.

In Western Tibet Cunningham has estimated the lay population of *Ladák*,
at 158,000, the Lamas at 12,000,\[2\] which gives one Lama to every
thirteen laymen. In Spíti the lay population was computed by Major Hay,
in 1845, to number 1414, the Lamas 193, or about one Lama to seven
laymen.\[3\]

For the Buddhist countries of the Eastern Himálaya I can give no numbers
at all, but only offer some general remarks. In Bhután, the number of
Lamas in proportion to the lay population in extremely great. In
Tassisúdon (*b*kra-shis-chhos-grong, *the holy town of the doctrine*)
1,500 to 2,000 live in the palace of the Dharma Raja alone; and their
number must be considered as one of the chief causes of the poverty of
the inhabitants. Pemberton

says that the expenses for the maintainance of this privileged class
have repeatedly been made the subject of earnest discussion.\[1\] In
*Síkkim* also the monasteries and Lamas are described by Hooker as being
very numerous and influential.\[2\]

For comparison I add some data for countries beyond the limits of High
Asia. Amongst the Kalmuks it was calculated, when Pallas visited their
country in the last century, that there was one lama to every 150 to 200
tents.\[3\]

In the environs of Pekin there are about 80,000 Buddhist monks.\[4\]

Ceylon has about 2,500 priests, a number which gives for a total
population of two millions one priest to 800.

In Bérma there is one priest to every thirtieth soul.

Occupations. The monks, notwithstanding the religious duties they have
to perform, would have plenty of time for the cultivation of larger
tracts of land; but the only thing they do in this way is to keep in the
best possible condition the gardens surrounding their monasteries, which
greatly contribute to their support and comfort: these same gardens are
also very often the only places for miles round where fruit-trees,
chiefly apricots, are met with. In general the Lamas are an idle Set of
people, disinclined to either bodily or mental exertion, the

majority passing the greater part of the day in revolving
prayer-cylinders, or counting the beads of rosaries, though occasionally
some are found who are very skilful in carving blocks of wood and making
images of gods, as well as in painting and sculpture. The cleverest
Lamas, however, as my brothers were frequently told, are generally
summoned to Lhássa.\[1\] Although every Lama can read and write, yet
these accomplishments form no favourite occupation among them; and with
reference to the slowness of their mode of writing, I may mention that
the Lama who copied the document concerning Hímis (see p. 183) spent
about six hours over it. The illiterateness of the Lamas has often been
regretted. Many were asked for an explanation of the six-syllabic prayer
Om mani padme hum, of whose magical influence upon the welfare of man so
many religious books treat; and it was not till after repeated inquiries
that at last a satisfactory answer was obtained. Schmidt was much
surprised at the answers which the Nepalese Buddhists gave Hodgson. "A
Tibetan or Mongolian Lama," he says, "would not have answered his
questions so well." Both Csoma and Huc have observed that the Lamas are
not very well acquainted with their sacred literature; Huc says that
they excuse their ignorance by urging the profoundness of their
religion; and again: "a Lama who knows Tibetan and Mongolian is styled a
sage, or wise

\[1. Compare Turner, "Embassy," p. 316. The activity of the Ladaki Lamas
in the cultivation of land, which Moorcroft, "Travels," Vol. I., p. 340,
notices, is actually confined to their gardens.--There was a very
skilful carver in wood residing in Spíti at the time of Trebeck's visit
to that province, and his works are highly praised by this traveller.\]

{p. 167}

man; and if he has also a slight knowledge of Chinese and Mandshu
literature, he is viewed as of more than human nature."\[1\] My brothers
also were often puzzled by the confused answers they received from the
Lamas to any questions either on natural phenomena, or concerning their
religion or history. The Lamas always preferred talking about matters
connected with mystical theology and it was a comparatively easy affair
to obtain from them explanations of the supposed magical properties of
particular charms.

The *Diet* of the Lamas is that usual in the country.\[2\] They may eat
whatever is offered them in alms, but are not allowed to drink
intoxicating liquors: these are, however, taken under the pretext of
"being medicine."\[3\] Animal food is not forbidden, Sâkyamuni himself
is said in Singhalese legends to have died from eating pork,\[4\] but it
is considered as an impediment to the attainment of perfection, as man
should view all animated beings as his brethern and relations, and not
kill them; there is

{p. 168}

even a proverb which says--"To eat flesh is equal to eating one's
relations."\[1\] Laymen, however, eat meat of any kind: according to my
brother Robert, however, they abstain--in Spíti at least--from partaking
of fish, although no satisfactory reason could be alleged by them for
their so doing. In order that the monks may not inordinately indulge
their appetite for meat, there exist a great many regulations; on
certain days no animal food whatever is allowed; the monks are also
obliged to abstain from it as often as confession is made, as also at
those periods when very sacred religious ceremonies are performed.

The principal food consists in rice, wheat, or barley, flour, milk, and
tea. The rice is boiled or roasted; the flour is mixed with milk and
tea, or formed into unleavened cakes and seasoned with salt. Such cakes
\]have a taste similar to, that of the unleavened bread of the Jews. The
tea is made in two different ways; first as an infusion with hot water,
as in Europe, and this preparation is called Cha-chosh "tea water;"\[2\]
secondly in a very peculiar manner, which I will describe in detail from
a a {*sic*} recipe obtained by my brothers at Leh:--

The tea--loosened brick-tea,--is mixed with nearly half its volume of
soda, in Tibetan called Phuli. The mixture is then thrown into a kettle
filled with the necessary quantity of cold water, the proportion varying

\[1. Comp. Wassiljew, 1. c., p. 134.

2\. This and the following terms, Phuli and Gurgur, do not occur in the
dictionaries.

3\. Brick tea is the commercial name of this peculiar kind of tea; it
refers to its having a form not unlike that of a brick. It obtains its
shape and at the same time its consistency by being pressed into a
form.\]

{p. 169}

as in our mode of making tea. When the water is about to boil. the
mixture of tea leaves and soda is stirred, an operation continued four
to six minutes after the boiling of the water. The kettle is then
removed from the fire and the tea is filtered through a cloth into a
round, wooden cylinder about three to four inches in diameter and two to
three feet high; the tealeaves are generally considered as useless and
are thrown away. The tea is vigorously querled in a wooden tub (called
in Tibetan Gurgur), like chocolate; a large amount of clarified butter
is then added (generally double the quantity of the brick tea), and some
salt; when the operation of querling is continued. Finally the tea is
again thrown into a kettle, mixed with milk, and heated anew, as it has
generally greatly cooled down during all the operations just described.
This tea, called "Cha," strongly resembles a kind of gruel and is taken,
together with meat or pastry, at dinner or Supper; but it is not allowed
to be taken during the performance of religious ceremonies, when
tea-water alone, Cha-chosh, is handed round as refreshment.\[1\]

On certain occasions the Lamas give grand dinners. To one of them my
brother Robert was invited at Leh; it had been arranged in honour of the
visit of a high Lama from Lhássa. Tea was given in the place of soup,
and was handed round all dinner time. A particular honour was shown to
the guests by care being taken that their

\[1. An yet thin brick tea is used almost exclusively, though it is to
be hoped that the exertions of the Indian Government to introduce tea
grown in the Himálaya and in Assam into Tibet will ere long meet with
success.\]

{p. 170}

cups should never become quite empty. There were various kinds of meat,
some roasted, some boiled, and even some as a kind of pie. No wine was
served, but the cooking was really much superior to that generally met
with in the country, and much better than could have been expected. On
inquiry Robert learned that the dinner had been cooked by the high
priest's own cook, whom he had brought with him from Lhássa.

Dress. The original precepts laid down by Sâkyamuni for regulating the
dress of the priests had been well adapted to the warm climate of India;
later, however, when his faith extended over more northerly and,
consequently, rougher climates, he himself is said to have allowed the
use of warmer clothing, of stockings, shoes, &c. The principal advantage
of dress, as taught by Sâkyamuni, is to cover the shame of the priest;
besides which, it has also other benefits, such as protection from the
cold and the attacks of mosquitoes, &c., things which cause disturbance
of the mind.\[1\]

The various parts of the dress of a Tibetan Lama are: a cap or hat, a
gown, an inner vest, trousers, a cloak, and boots.\[2\]

Caps and hats. The caps are made of double felt or cloth, between which
are put charms; in the rainy

\[1. Hardy, "Eastern Monachism," Chapter XII.

2\. In the Himálaya districts and in Western Tibet the predominant
colour of the objects of dress is a more or less brillant {*sic*} red;
yellow is met with among the sects enumerated p. 72--About the dress in
general notices are also found in Turner, "Embassy," pp. 32, 86, 242,

{p. 171}

districts of the Himálaya the Lamas wear during the summer large hats of
Straw. The shape of the caps varies considerably, but it is curious that
they are all of Chinese or Mongolian fashion, whilst the form of the:
robes has been adopted from the Hindus. The mode of salutation is also
the Chinese as the Tibetans always take. off their hat, whilst the
Hindus, as a sign of reverence, approach their masters not bare-headed,
but bare-footed. Most of the caps are conical, with a large lap, which
is generally doubled up, but is let down over the ears in cold weather
(see plate XVI. where the laps are let down). The head Lamas wear a
particular sort of cap, generally low and conical, similar to those worn
by Padma Sambhava\[1\] and mythological deified persons of particular
influence upon man's welfare, as King Bihar; this form is called
Nathongzha. Some head-priests of' Western Tibet have an hexagonal hat
formed of pasteboard, and showing four steps diminishing towards the
top; or in some cases a kind of mitre of red cloth ornamented with
flowers of gold worked in the stuff. This latter kind of cap bears a
remarkable resemblance to the mitres of Roman Catholic bishops.
Occasionally, if the weather allows it, the Lamas in Eastern Tibet, in
Bhután and also in Síkkim, go bare-headed.

The gown reaches to the calves and is fastened round the waist by a
slender girdle; it has an upright collar and is closely buttoned. up at
the neck. In Síkkim the Lamas occasionally wear, slung round the
shoulders, a kind of red and yellow striped woollen stole. In general

\[1. See the plates in Hooker, "Himalayan Journals," Vol. I., p. 328.\]

{p. 172}

the gown has sleeves, except in the Bhután Duárs, a country where the
mean temperature does not go down even in the coldest mouth, in January,
below 22° or 18° Fahrenheit.

The inner vest has no sleeves, and reaches to the haunches. It is not at
all cut to the form of the body of the individual but hangs down quite
straight. In Ladák, most of the Lamas wear it over the gown instead of
underneath.

\#\#\#

The *trousers* are fastened to the waist by a sort of lace running in a
drawing hem. The two legs are equidistant throughout, also in their
inner side, as in Fig. *a*, and not in *b*. During the winter the
trousers are worn over the larger gown as a better protection against
the cold. In Bhután the Lamas, according to Turner,\[1\] wear, instead
of trousers, philibegs hanging down nearly as far as the knee.

The *cloak*, in Tibetan Lagoi, "the upper garment," is the distinctive
ecclesiastical dress of the monks, in which also the Buddhas,
Bôdhisattvas and sacred Lamas are represented. It is a long but narrow
shawl of wool or sometimes even of silk, ten to twenty feet long, and
two

\[1. "Embassy," p. 86-The wearing of trousers is a very ancient custom;
see the most interesting and complete work of Weiss, "Kostümkunde," Vol.
II., pp. 545-674, who gives many drawings in which the races who in
ancient times inhabited Northern and Eastern Asia, are represented with
trousers. It is altogether remarkable to see their dress but little
differing from what they wear now.\]

{p. 173}

to three feet broad; it is thrown over the left shoulder and passed
under the right arm, so as to leave bare the right arm. Perhaps the
custom of having the right arm uncovered may he explained from the
rejection of the castes by Sâkyamuni; for the border of the shawl
describes a line across the breast just as the triple cord does, which
according to the laws of Menu, the three higher castes alone are allowed
to wear; whilst the shawl had been worn by all priests, from whatever
caste they may have sprung.\[1\]

The *boots* are made of stiff felt, either white or red, and are
ornamented with perpendicular blue stripes. They reach up to the calves.
The soles are of double-felt, sometimes furnished, besides, with a sole
of leather. These soles form a very solid and unyielding support for the
foot, protecting it very well against sharp stones, much better than do
the shoes worn by the Turkistanis, the sole of which consists of thin
leather only, which gives neither protection against the roughness of
the ground nor support to the foot; the advantages of the Tibetan boots
are, however, sometimes secured by thick felt-stockings.

My brothers have seen shoes in use but very rarely, and then only
amongst the superiors of the monasteries.

To complete the description of the appearance of a Lama I have still to
notice various smaller articles generally worn. From the girdle which
keeps together

\[1. Menu, Chapter II., pp. 42, 44. On ancient sculptures the Buddhas
not unfrequently wear nothing but the three strings; see the drawings in
Crawfurd's Archipelago, Vol. II., and in Foucaux's Rgya chher rol pa,
Vol. II., Plate I.\]

{p. 174}

the gown, hang a knife-case and several purses or little pockets
containing various articles, such as a tooth-brush, a tongue-scraper and
an ear-pick, steel and tinder, tabacco or betel-nut, dice used in
foretelling future events; a prayer-cylinder and a Chinese metal pipe
are also almost always to be found among the articles fastened to it.

The *rosaries*, in Tibetan Thengpa, indispensable instruments for
counting the due number of prayers, are generally fastened to the
girdle, or sometimes worn round the neck.\[1\] The beads amount to 108,
which answer to the number of the volumes of the Kanjur; but most of
those used by the lay population have a much smaller number of beads,
about thirty to forty. The beads are of wood, pebbles, or bones of holy
Lamas; the latter have a very high price; the rosaries of the head Lamas
are not unfrequently of precious stones, particularly of nephrite (the
Turkistani Yashem) and of turquoise. To most rosaries are fastened a
pair of pinchers, needles, an ear-pick, and a small Dorje.\[2\]

The *amulet-boxes*, in Tibetan Gau\~ (in the Lêpcha language of Síkkim
Koro, and Kandum, if of wood), are likewise worn round the neck; and it
is not unfrequent to see several fastened to the same string. Most of
the

Journals," Vol. II., p. 142.

2\. Pinchers are in use even amongst the rudest tribes, who go almost
naked; for they need them to draw out thorns. I add as another instance
of the ancient use of pinchers, that we have found them also in the
oldest graves in the Franconian Hills, in Bavaria.\]

{p. 175}

boxes are pointed, imitating the form of a fig-leaf; but they are also
square or circular. The outside is either embossed or painted.

Wooden boxes are closed by a slide, which has not "frequently a space
cut out to allow the image of the chosen tutelary god to be seen. Those
of brass have the two parts fitting together like the cover and the
lower part of boxes; but hinges are replaced by rings, of which one at
least must be connected with each part. A string or a piece of leather
can be passed through, and serves to hang up the object as well as to
keep it together.

The things put into such cases are relies, images of deities, objects
which are believed to be dreaded by the evil spirits, and charms.\[1\] I
had occasion to examine the following different sorts:--

1\. A square wooden box from Gyúngul, in Gnári Khórsum; the box was
bound in brass. In the interior were carved on one side one of the
goddesses Dolma (see p. 66), who are supposed to protect against
emaciation, having on her left Chenresi (see p. 88) and Amitâbha (see p.
53) on her right. The opposite side shows Sâkyamuni with the same
deities.

2\. A leaf-shaped wooden box painted yellow, with red clouds. It
contained a figure of Shinje (see p. 93) of tinted clay; at the bottom
of the cue lay a little medal of hardened barley-paste representing
Tsonkhapa

\[1. Compare about the kind of charms, Csoma, "Journ. As. Soc. Beng.,"
Vol. IX., p. 905.\]

{p. 176}

(see p. 69); it is half an inch in diameter, and was wrapped in paper
covered with charms.

3\. A circular box of brass with charms and a similar medal of
Tsonkhapa, covered with gold paint.

4\. Three conical brass boxes fastened to one string. The central box
enclosed a gilt figure of Tsepagmed (= Amitâbha, see p. 129), who is
supposed to grant longevity. Also a piece of copper formed to represent
a thunderbolt was wrapped in a piece of red cloth as a protection from
the effects of lightning. In the smallest box several slips of paper
were covered with seals of the Dalai Lama printed in red, which are
supposed to protect against death by drowning. I found there also grains
of barley and earth. The third box contained several figures of Lha
Dolma, and Tsonkhapa (all carefully wrapped in pieces of red silk)
alternating with charm-papers.

The charms were all written in small characters, or running hand, but by
the friction against the images and grains the papers had been almost
reduced to loose fibres. All objects were strongly perfumed with musk,
and had besides, like every sacred article fabricated in monasteries, an
unpleasant greasy odour.\[1\]

amulet boxes described above, from originals obtained by my brothers,
will be given in a plate accompanying the "Results of a Scientific
Mission to India and High Asia."\]
