# 5: THE ADVANTAGES OF THE PRACTICE OF THE MAHAYANA FAITH

HAVING discussed the practice of these principles we will now discuss
the advantages of practising them. We have already given a general idea
of the mysterious resources of the Buddhas of the Mahayana school.

A. If any one desires to get a right faith in the deep things of the
Tathagata, and desires to be far from error, which brings religion into
disrepute, and to get the Mahayana Faith, he should lay hold of this
book, study it and practise it. In the end he will attain to the very
highest truth.

B. If a man listens to this truth, and has neither fear nor weakness,
such a man is certain to succeed to the rank of Buddha, and to be
enrolled as such by all the Divine Ones.

C. If a man should be able to reform all living beings throughout all
the systems in the universe, in order to make them good, he would not be
equal to a man who, for only the time he takes to eat a meal, studies
this way of deliverance. The two methods are incomparable.

D. Next, if a man takes this book, studies and practises it only for a
day and a night, the blessings received would be incalculable. Even if
all the Buddhas of the universe were each to speak of these blessings
for incalculably and immeasurably long kalpas, they could not exhaust
them, for the blessings of the Eternal Nature are endless, and the
blessings to this man would be also in like manner endless.

E. But if there should be any who speak evil and do not believe in this
book, the recompense of their sin will be to suffer immense pain for
measureless ages. On this account all men should respectfully believe
and not speak evil of it, thereby injuring themselves more and more and
others too, destroying every hope of deliverance by destroying the
Eternal Soul of the Three Precious Ones originally in man (the soul of
the universe, the body of laws pervading the universe, the body of men
teaching these laws), for all the Divine Ones attain to Nirvana by this
means, and all the Saints attain Buddha-wisdom by the same practice.

F. Know that it is by this means that the Bodhisattvas of the past
obtained pure faith, and that it is by this means that the Bodhisattvas
of the present obtain pure faith, therefore it is by this means that the
Bodhisattvas of the future must obtain pure faith. Thus all men should
diligently study and practise it.

THE CLOSING HYMN

Deep and wide is Buddhist Law,  
This in brief I have declared;  
Godward are eternal stores,  
Blessings give to countless worlds!
