# 2: THE FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINE OF THE MAHAYANA FAITH

HAVING explained the object of writing this book, we now proceed to
consider the fundamental doctrine of the Mahayana Faith. The great
school (Mahayana) speaks of the Eternal Soul of the universe, His nature
and His attributes.

A. By His nature is meant the Soul of all living beings. The soul
embraces that of saved and of unsaved beings, and it is this universal
Soul that characterizes the great school. For it is the Archetype's True
Eternal Form which is the nature of the Mahayana Faith; and the
Archetype's temporary form in life which is able to make manifest the
nature, form, and use of the Mahayana Faith.

B. As to the attributes of this Soul, they are three. The first is the
vastness of its nature. All things are originally one and the same and
an eternally fixed quantity in the True Model. The second covers its
vast manifestations. In the person of the Tathagata, the True Model
Form, there are infinite possibilities stored up as in a womb. The third
is its vast power. It is able to produce all good among all classes of
unsaved beings.

All the enlightened Buddhas follow this Mahayana Faith, and all the
Bodhisattvas attain to the perfection of Tathagatahood by the methods of
this Faith of the New Buddhism.
