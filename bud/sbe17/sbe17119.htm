<p>1. 'Now, thus, O Bhikkhus, should the revocation be carried out. Those Bhikkhus who are followers of Pa<I>n</I><I>d</I>uka and Lohitaka should go before the Sa<I>m</I>gha, with their upper robe arranged over one shoulder, and should bow down at the feet of the elder Bhikkhus, and squatting down, and raising their hands with the palms joined together, should speak as follows: "We, Sirs, have been subjected by the Sa<I>m</I>gha to the Ta<I>g</I><I>g</I>aniya-kamma, and are conducting ourselves aright in accordance thereto; and we have become subdued, and we seek for release, and beg for a revocation of the Ta<I>g</I><I>g</I>aniya-kamma."</p>

<p>2. '"Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha hear me. These Bhikkhus who are followers of Pa<I>n</I><I>d</I>uka and Lohitaka have been subjected (&amp;c., as before), and they are conducting themselves (&amp;c., as before), and they beg (&amp;c., as before).</p>

<p>'"Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha hear me. These Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before, down to) and they beg for a revocation of the Ta<I>g</I><I>g</I>aniya-kamma. The Sa<I>m</I>gha revokes the Ta<I>g</I><I>g</I>aniya-kamma for the Bhikkhus who are followers of Pa<I>n</I><I>d</I>uka and Lohitaka. Whosoever of the venerable ones approves of the revocation of the Ta<I>g</I><I>g</I>aniya-kamma for the Bhikkhus who are followers of Pa<I>n</I><I>d</I>uka and Lohitaka, let him hold his peace. Whosoever approves not thereof, let him speak.</p>  
<p>'"And a second time I say the same thing. Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha (&amp;c., as before, down to) let him speak.</p>  
<p>'"And a third time I say the same thing. Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha (&amp;c., as before, down to) let him speak.</p>  
<p>'"The revocation of the Ta<I>g</I><I>g</I>aniya-kamma for the Bhikkhus who are followers of Pa<I>n</I><I>d</I>uka and Lohitaka has been carried by the Sa<I>m</I>gha. The Sa<I>m</I>gha approves; therefore is it silent. Thus do I understand."'</p>
