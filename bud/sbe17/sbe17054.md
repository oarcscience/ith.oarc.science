### 40.

1\. Now at that time there used to arise among the Bhikkhus a fear lest
they should offend in

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

some particular or other, they thinking, 'Has this been permitted by the
Blessed One, or has it not?'

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'Whatsoever, O Bhikkhus, has not been disallowed by me in the words,
"This beseems you not," then, if that thing is in accord with what is
unlawful, and is contrary to what is lawful, that is not lawful.
Whatsoever has not been disallowed by me with the words, "This beseems
you not," then, if that thing is in accord with what is lawful, and is
contrary to what is unlawful, that is lawful.

'And whatsoever, O Bhikkhus, has not been allowed by me with the words,
"This beseems you," then, if that thing is in accord with what is
lawful, and is contrary to what is unlawful, that is not lawful.
Whatsoever has not been allowed by me with the words, "This beseems
you," then, if that thing is in accord with what is lawful, and is
contrary to what is unlawful, that is lawful <span

2\. Then the Bhikkhus thought: 'Is food that may be eaten till the first
watch of the night <span id="fr_267"></span>[2](#fn_263.md) lawful, or not,
when mixed with food that ought to be eaten before noon on the same day?
Is food that may be eaten at any time within seven days <span
id="fr_268"></span>[3](#fn_264.md) lawful, or not, when mixed with food
that ought to be eaten before noon on the same day? Is food that may be
eaten at any time during life <span id="fr_269"></span>[4](#fn_265.md)
lawful, or not, when mixed with food that ought to be eaten

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

before noon on the same day? Is food that may be eaten at any time
within seven days lawful, or not, when mixed with food that may be eaten
at any time during life? Is food that may be eaten at any time during
life lawful, or not, when mixed with food that may be eaten at any time
within seven days?'

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

3\. 'Food that may be eaten up to the first watch of the night, or food
that may be eaten at any time within seven days, or food that may be
eaten at any time during life, is lawful, O Bhikkhus, when mixed with
food that ought to be eaten before noon on the same day, up till
noon-time, and it is-not lawful after noon-time. Food that may be eaten
at any time within seven days, or food that may be eaten at any time
during life, is lawful, O Bhikkhus,--when it has been mixed with food
that may be eaten up to the first watch of the night,--up till the first
watch of the night, and is not lawful after the first watch of the
night. Food that may be eaten at any time during life, is lawful, O
Bhikkhus,--when it has been mixed with food that may be eaten at any
time within seven days,--at any time within seven days, and is not
lawful beyond seven days <span id="fr_270"></span>[1](#fn_266.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_262"></span>[144:1](sbe17054.htm#fr_266.md) The formal
expressions referred to in these two paragraphs are precisely the
expressions to which, in the Book of the Great Decease VI, 40, and in
the *K*ullavagga XI, 1, r, Subhadda is stated to have taken such serious
objection.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[144:2](sbe17054.htm#fr_267.md) This refers to
certain medicines; see Mahâvagga VI, 1, 5.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[144:3](sbe17054.htm#fr_268.md) This also refers
to certain medicines; see the 23rd Nissaggiya.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[144:4](sbe17054.htm#fr_269.md) What this refers
to is unknown to us.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[145:1](sbe17054.htm#fr_270.md) Buddhaghosa says
that this holds good if the two are so mixed that the taste (rasu) has
become one (sambhinna). If the two are not so mixed, then they may be
divided, and the part allow-able during the longer period may be enjoyed
up to the end of that period. See I, 20, 9; V, 2, 1; VI, 16, 3; VIII, I,
24, and the notes there.
