### 22.

1\. Now when the Blessed One had remained at Sâvatthi as long as he
thought fit, he went forth on his journey to Râ*g*agaha. And wandering
straight on he arrived at Râ*g*agaha: and there at Râ*g*agaha he stayed
at the Veluvana in the Kalandaka-nivâpa.

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu was suffering from fistula <span
id="fr_180"></span>[4](#fn_178). And the physician (named.md) Âkâsa-gotta
lanced it. And the Blessed One when he

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

was going round through the sleeping-places came to the place where that
Bhikkhu dwelt.

2\. Âkâsa-gotta, the physician, saw the Blessed One coming from afar;
and when he saw him he said to the Blessed One: 'Let the venerable
Gotama come and look at this Bhikkhu's orifice; it is like the mouth of
an iguana!' And the Blessed One thinking, 'This foolish fellow is making
fun of me,' kept silence and turned away. And in that connection, and on
account of that, he called a meeting of the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha, and asked
the Bhikkhus: Is there, O Bhikkhus, in that Vihâra a Bhikkhu who is
sick?'

'There is, Lord.'

'What is the matter, O Bhikkhus, with that Bhikkhu?'

'That venerable one, Lord, has a fistula, and Âkâsa-gotta, the
physician, has been lancing it.'

3\. The Blessed Buddha rebuked (that Bhikkhu), saying, 'This is
improper, O Bhikkhus, for that foolish one, unbecoming, indecent,
unworthy of Sama*n*as, not allowable, and ought not to be done. How can
this foolish fellow, O Bhikkhus, allow a surgical operation to be
performed in that part of his body <span
id="fr_181"></span>[1](#fn_179.md)? The skin there, O Bhikkhus, is tender,
the wound is difficult to treat, the knife is difficult to guide. This
will not redound, O Bhikkhus, to the conversion of the unconverted.'

And having rebuked him, the Blessed One, after delivering a religious
discourse, said to the Bhikkhus: You are not, O Bhikkhus, to allow a
surgical operation to be performed upon you in that part

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

of your bodies. Whosoever allows that, is guilty of a thulla*kk*aya
offence.'

4\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus, since a surgical
operation had been forbidden by the Blessed One, used a clyster <span
id="fr_182"></span>[1](#fn_180.md).

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'Is it true, as they say, O Bhikkhus, that the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus
use a clyster?'

'It is true, Lord.'

He rebuked them, and having delivered a religious discourse, said to the
Bhikkhus: 'No surgical operation is to be performed within a distance of
two inches round the anus, and a clyster is not to be used. Whosoever
does so, is guilty of a thulla*kk*aya offence <span
id="fr_183"></span>[2](#fn_181.md).'
