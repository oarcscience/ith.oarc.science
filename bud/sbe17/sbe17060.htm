<P><A NAME="fn_311"></A><A HREF="sbe17060.htm#fr_316">161:1</A> This case is word for word identical with the second case in chap. 2. 1. After it follow the third and fourth case of chap. 2. 1, which it is unnecessary to print here again in full extent. The triad of these cases is repeated here in order to serve as a basis for the variations which are to follow in &sect;&sect; 2, 3.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_312"></A><A HREF="sbe17060.htm#fr_317">161:2</A> The triad of &sect; 1 is repeated here, with the difference, as is seen from the opening clauses which we have fully printed, that the Bhikkhu, before he has got beyond the boundary, and not afterwards as in &sect; 1, resolves upon not returning to the &acirc;v&acirc;sa.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_313"></A><A HREF="sbe17060.htm#fr_318">161:3</A> The whole triad as in &sect; 1. The only difference between &sect; 3 and &sect; 1 consists in the following words being added in &sect; 3 in each of the three cases, 'without taking a resolution; he neither thinks "I will come back," nor does he think "I will not come back."'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_314"></A><A HREF="sbe17060.htm#fr_319">162:1</A> Supply here the whole triad as in &sect; 1, the words 'thinking "I will come back"' being constantly added. After this triad follow three other cases which are exactly identical with the three contained in chap. 2. 2.</P>
