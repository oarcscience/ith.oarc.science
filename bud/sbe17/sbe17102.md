(. . . . ten, . . . . twenty) persons, if performed by a congregation in
which a Bhikkhunî, &c. <span id="fr_513"></span>[1](#fn_504.md), is the
fifth ( . . . . tenth, . . . . twentieth), is no real act and ought not
to be performed.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

End of the regulations about acts performed by five, (ten, twenty)

6\. 'If, O Bhikkhus, a congregation in which a person sentenced to the
parivâsa discipline <span id="fr_514"></span>[2](#fn_505.md) is the fourth,
institutes the proceedings of parivâsa, of mûlâya pa*t*ikassanâ, and of
mânatta, or if a congregation in which such a person is the twentieth,
confers abbhâna, this is no real act and ought not to be performed.

'If, O Bhikkhus, a congregation in which a person that ought to be
sentenced to mûlâya pa*t*ikassanâ . . . . that ought to be sentenced to
mânatta . . . . that is subject to the mânatta discipline . . . .

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

on whom the abbhâna sentence ought to be conferred <span
id="fr_515"></span>[1](#fn_506.md), institutes the proceedings of parivâsa,
of mûlâya pa*t*ikassanâ, and of mânatta, or if a congregation in which
such a person is the twentieth, confers abbhâna, this is no real act and
ought not to be performed.

7\. 'Of some persons, O Bhikkhus, the protest <span
id="fr_516"></span>[2](#fn_507.md) raised in the assembly is effectual, of
some persons it is ineffectual.

'And which are the persons, O Bhikkhus, whose protest raised in the
assembly is ineffectual?

'The protest, O Bhikkhus, raised in the assembly by a Bhikkhunî is
ineffectual. The protest, O Bhikkhus, raised in the assembly by a
sikkhamânâ (&c. <span id="fr_517"></span>[3](#fn_508), down to:.md) by a
person against whom the Sa*m*gha institutes a proceeding, is
ineffectual. These are the persons, O Bhikkhus, whose protest raised in
the assembly is ineffectual.

8\. 'And which are the persons, O Bhikkhus, whose protest raised in the
assembly is effectual?

'The protest, O Bhikkhus, of a Bhikkhu who is healthy (in mind), who
belongs to the same communion  <span id="fr_518"></span>[4](#fn_509.md),
who stays within the same boundary <span
id="fr_519"></span>[5](#fn_510.md), even

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

if he have committed a sin which brings about immediate punishment in
hell,--if he give notice of his protest at the meeting,--is effectual.
This is the person, O Bhikkhus, whose protest raised in the assembly is
effectual.

9\. 'There are, O Bhikkhus, two cases of expulsion <span
id="fr_520"></span>[1](#fn_511) (pronounced against, a person.md). If
expulsion, O Bhikkhus, had not been pronounced (before) against a
person, and the Sa*m*gha pronounces expulsion against him, there are
some against whom such expulsion has been pronounced duly, and others
against whom it has been pronounced unduly.

'And which is a person, O Bhikkhus, against whom, if expulsion had not
been pronounced before, and the Sa*m*gha pronounces expulsion against
him, expulsion has been pronounced unduly? In case, O Bhikkhus, there be
a pure, guiltless Bhikkhu,--if the Sa*m*gha pronounces expulsion against
him, expulsion has been pronounced unduly. This, O Bhikkhus, is called a
person against whom, if expulsion had not been pronounced before, and
the Sa*m*gha pronounces expulsion against him, expulsion has been
pronounced unduly.

'And which is a person, O Bhikkhus, against whom, &c., expulsion has
been pronounced duly? In case, O Bhikkhus, there be an ignorant,
unlearned Bhikkhu, a constant offender, who is unable to discern what is
an offence <span id="fr_521"></span>[2](#fn_512.md), who lives in lay
society, unduly

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

associating himself with lay people,--if the Sa*m*gha pronounces
expulsion against him, expulsion has been pronounced duly. This, O
Bhikkhus, is called a person, &c.

10\. 'There are, O Bhikkhus, two cases of restoration (of an expelled
Bhikkhu). If restoration, O Bhikkhus, had not been granted before to a
person, and the Sa*m*gha grants restoration to him, there are some to
whom such restoration will have been granted duly, and others to whom it
will have been unduly granted.

'And which is a person, O Bhikkhus, to whom, &c., restoration has been
granted unduly? A eunuch, O Bhikkhus, to whom restoration had not been
granted before, and whom the Sa*m*gha restores, has been restored
unduly. A person who has furtively attached himself (to the Sa*m*gha),
&c. <span id="fr_522"></span>[1](#fn_513.md), to whom restoration had not
been granted before, and whom the Sa*m*gha restores, has been restored
unduly.

'This, O Bhikkhus, is called a person to whom, &c., restoration has been
granted unduly. These, O Bhikkhus, are called persons to whom, &c.,
restoration has been granted duly.

11\. 'And which is a person, O Bhikkhus, to whom, &c., restoration has
been granted duly?' &c. <span id="fr_523"></span>[2](#fn_514.md)

End of the first Bhâ*n*avâra, called the Vâsabha-gâma Bhâ*n*avâra.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_500"></span>[268:1](sbe17102.htm#fr_509.md) See *K*ullavagga
III, 2 seq.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[269:1](sbe17102.htm#fr_510.md) As regards the
exceptional regulations referring to the upasampadâ ordination in the
bordering countries, see above, V, 13, 12.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[269:2](sbe17102.htm#fr_511.md) Here follows the
very frequent enumeration given, for instance, at II, 36, §§ 1-4.

<span id="fn_503"></span>[269:3](sbe17102.htm#fr_512.md) Generally
speaking, the two categories of 'persons belonging to another
communion,' and 'persons staying within another boundary,' can be
considered as coincident. In certain cases, however, they could be
distinguished; see X, 1, §§ 9, 10.

<span id="fn_504"></span>[270:1](sbe17102.htm#fr_513.md) Here the
enumeration of § 2 is repeated.

<span id="fn_505"></span>[270:2](sbe17102.htm#fr_514.md) See about
parivâsa, and the other Sa*m*ghakammas referred to in this paragraph,
the details given in the second book of the *K*ullavagga.

<span id="fn_506"></span>[271:1](sbe17102.htm#fr_515.md) But has not yet
been conferred. An abbhita Bhikkhu is considered as fully rehabilitated.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[271:2](sbe17102.htm#fr_516.md) Against official
acts which the Sa*m*gha is performing.

<span id="fn_508"></span>[271:3](sbe17102.htm#fr_517.md) This list of
persons who cannot protest against official acts of the Sa*m*gha differs
from that given in § 2 or at II, 36, §§ 1-4, only by three categories
being here added after 'a person guilty of an extreme offence'
(antimavatthu*m* a*ggh*âpannaka). These categories are the following: 'a
madman,' 'a person whose mind is unhinged,' 'a person who suffers
(bodily) pain.' See II, 22, 3, &c,

<span id="fn_509"></span>[271:4](sbe17102.htm#fr_518.md) That is, the
Sa*m*gha which is going to perform the act in question.

<span id="fn_510"></span>[271:5](sbe17102.htm#fr_519.md) See the note at §
2.

<span id="fn_511"></span>[272:1](sbe17102.htm#fr_520.md) Compare the rules
regarding the pabbâ*g*aniyakamma, *K*ullavagga I, 13 seq., and our note
at I, 79, 1.

<span id="fn_512"></span>[272:2](sbe17102.htm#fr_521.md) Anapadâna.
Buddhaghosa: 'Anapadâno ’ti apa*t*âna-(read apadâna-) virahito.
apadâna*m* vu*kk*ati pari*kkh*edo. âpatti-pari*kkh*eda-virahito ’ti
attho.' Probably the word must not be derived from the root dâ, 'to
give,' but from dâ, 'to cut.'

<span id="fn_513"></span>[273:1](sbe17102.htm#fr_522.md) See the list of
persons given at II, 36, 3.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[273:2](sbe17102.htm#fr_523.md) The formality and
the repetitions are the same here as in § 20, and need not be repeated.
The list of persons whose restoration is stated to be valid is the same
as at I, 71, 1.
