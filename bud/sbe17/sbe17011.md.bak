1\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu, as he was passing through the
Kosala country to Sâvatthi, to visit the Blessed One, was taken ill on
the way. And that Bhikkhu went aside out of the road, and sat down at
the foot of a certain tree.

When people saw him sitting there, they said: 'Whither is your reverence
going?'

'I am going, friends, to Sâvatthi to visit the Blessed One.'

2\. 'Come along, Sir; let us go together.'

'I cannot, friends. I am sick.'

'Well then, Sir, get up into the cart.'

'Enough, friends! The Blessed One has forbidden the use of vehicles.'
And fearing to offend, he refused to get up into the cart.

And when that Bhikkhu had come to Sâvatthi, he told this thing to the
Bhikkhus, and they told it to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, if you are sick, to use a cart.'

Now the Bhikkhus thought: 'Should the carts be yoked with cows or
bulls?'

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to use a cart drawn by bullocks, or by
hand <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_57.md).'

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu was exceedingly distressed by the
jolting of a cart.

I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a litter or a sedan-chair.'

3\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus were in the habit of
using lofty and large things to recline upon, that is to say: large
cushions <span id="fr_59"></span>[2](#fn_58.md); divans; coverlets with
long fleece; counterpanes of many colours, woollen coverlets <span
id="fr_60"></span>[3](#fn_59.md), white or marked with thick flowers;
mattresses; cotton coverlets, dyed with figures of animals; rugs with
long hair on one or both sides; carpets inwrought with gold, or with
silk; large woollen carpets such as the nautch girls dance upon <span
id="fr_61"></span>[4](#fn_60.md); rich elephant housings, horse-rugs, or
carriage rugs; panther or antelope skins; couches covered with canopies,
or with crimson cushions at both ends <span
id="fr_62"></span>[5](#fn_61.md).

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

When people, who went to visit the Vihâras, saw these things, they were
annoyed, murmured, and became angry, thinking, 'This is as if they were
still enjoying the pleasures of the world.'

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

4\. 'Lofty and large things to recline upon, such as large cushions
(&c., as in § 3, down to:) cushions crimson at both ends, are not, O
Bhikkhus, to be

used. Whosoever uses them, is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence.'

5\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus, since the use of lofty
and large things to recline upon had been forbidden by the Blessed One,
used to use fine skins, such as lion, tiger, and panther skins. These
skins were cut to fit the couches, and to fit the chairs; and were
spread inside or outside the couches or the chairs.

When people, who went to visit the Vihâras, saw these things, they were
annoyed, murmured, and became angry, thinking, 'This is as if they were
still enjoying the pleasures of the world.'

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

6\. 'Fine skins, such as lion, tiger, and panther skins, are not, O
Bhikkhus, to be used. Whosoever does so, is guilty of a dukka*t*a
offence.'

7\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus, since fine skins had
been forbidden by the Blessed

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> One, began to use
the skins of oxen. These skins were cut to fit the couches, or the
chairs; and were spread inside or outside the couches, or the chairs.

Now a certain Bhikkhu of bad character was a friend of the family of a
certain lay-disciple of a bad character. And that bad Bhikkhu, early one
morning, dressed himself, and with his robe on and his bowl in his hand,
went to the dwelling-place of that bad disciple, and sat down on a seat
made ready for him. And the bad disciple went up to the place where the
bad Bhikkhu was, and saluted him, and took his seat beside him.

8\. Now at that time that bad disciple had a young bull beautiful to
behold, quiet, and varied in colour like a panther's cub. And the bad
Bhikkhu gazed with longing at the bull. And that bad disciple said to
that bad Bhikkhu: 'Why does your reverence gaze so with longing at that
bull?'

'My friend,' said he, 'I want that bull's skin.'

Then that bad disciple slew that bull, and skinned it, and gave it to
that bad Bhikkhu. And that bad Bhikkhu, hiding that skin under his robe,
went away.

9\. Now the cow, greedy for her calf, followed that bad Bhikkhu, keeping
behind him. The Bhikkhus said:

'How is it, friend, that this cow keeps following so behind you?'

'I don't know, friends, why it should keep following me.'

But that bad Bhikkhu's robe was soiled with blood; and the Bhikkhus
asked him,

'How has this robe of yours got marked with blood?'

Then he told them the whole matter.

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

'How is that, Sir? You have been causing another to deprive a living
thing of life!' 'That is so, friends.'

The modest among the Bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry,
saying, 'How can this Bhikkhu induce a man to deprive a living thing of
life? Has not the taking of life been censured, and the abstinence
therefrom been praised in many a discourse by the Blessed One?'

And the Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.

Then the Blessed One held because of this, and on that occasion, an
assembly of the community of Bhikkhus, and asked that wicked Bhikkhu,

'Is it true, as they say, that you, O Bhikkhu, have been inducing
another to deprive a living thing of life?'

'It is true, Lord.'

'But how can you be so foolish as to do so? Have I not censured in many
a discourse the taking of life, O foolish one, and praised the
abstinence therefrom? Such conduct, thou foolish one, will not conduce
to the conversion of the unconverted!'

And having thus rebuked him, and delivered a religious discourse, he
addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

Bhikkhus! No one shall cause a living thing to be deprived of life.
Whosoever does so shall be dealt with according to the Laws <span
id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_62.md). Ox-skins are not to be worn, O Bhikkhus.
Whosoever does so, is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence. And neither, O
Bhikkhus, is any skin to be made use of at all. Whosoever does so, is
guilty of a dukka*t*a offence.'

the Ma*ggh*ima Sîla, § 5 (Rh. D., 'Buddhist Suttas from the Pâli,' p.

Sumaṅgala Vilâsinî. Several of the items are also mentioned among the
possessions of the Great King of Glory (Rh. D., loc. cit., p. 274, &c.).
In several cases the exact meaning is at present quite uncertain. The
comment on the last two words runs as follows: Sauttara*kkh*adan ti saha
