\[Here follow the twelve cases in which a Kamma is against the law, and
the twelve in which it is according to law; and also the six permissive
cases in which it may be carried out, if the Sa*m*gha likes, precisely
as in chapters 2, 3, and 4.\]

### 27 <span id="fr_674"></span>[1](#fn_660).

1\. 'A Bhikkhu against whom the Ukkhepaniyakamma that follows on not
acknowledging a fault has been carried out ought to conduct himself
aright. And herein this is the right conduct: he ought not to confer the
upasampadâ--he ought not to give a nissaya <span
id="fr_675"></span>[2](#fn_661)--he ought not to provide himself with a
sâma*n*era <span id="fr_676"></span>[2](#fn_661)--he ought not to accept
the office of giving exhortation to the nuns <span
id="fr_677"></span>[2](#fn_661)--if he have accepted that office, he
ought not to exhort the nuns <span id="fr_678"></span>[2](#fn_661)--he
ought not to commit the offence for which the Ukkhepaniya-kamma that
follows on not acknowledging a fault has been carried out against
him--nor any offence of a similar kind--nor any worse offence--he ought
not to find fault with the proceeding (that has been carried out against
him)--nor with (the Bhikkhus) who have carried it out-- <span
id="fr_679"></span>[3](#fn_662)he ought not to accept from a regular
Bhikkhu reverence, or

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span> *sic*

service, or salutation, or respect, nor allow him to provide a seat, or
a sleeping-place, or water for the feet, or a foot-stool <span
id="fr_680"></span>[4](#fn_663), or a foot-towel <span
id="fr_681"></span>[5](#fn_664) for him, nor to carry his bowl or his
robe, nor to shampoo him <span id="fr_682"></span>[3](#fn_662)--he ought
not to harass a regular Bhikkhu with a complaint that he has failed in
morality, or in conduct, or in doctrine, or in the mode of obtaining a
livelihood--he ought not to cause division between a Bhikkhu and the
Bhikkhus--he ought not to wear the outward signs of being a layman, or
of being a follower of some other doctrine <span
id="fr_683"></span>[6](#fn_665)--he ought not to follow the professors
of other doctrines--he ought to follow the Bhikkhus--he ought to train
himself in the training of the Bhikkhus--he ought not to dwell under one
and the same roof with a regular Bhikkhu, whether in a place formally
declared to be a residence, or to be not a residence, or in a place
which is neither the one nor the other,--on seeing a regular Bhikkhu he
ought to rise from his seat--he ought not to touch <span
id="fr_684"></span>[7](#fn_666) a regular Bhikkhu, either inside or
outside (of the residence)--he ought not to raise objections against a
regular Bhikkhu's taking part in the Uposatha ceremony <span
id="fr_685"></span>[8](#fn_667)--or in the Pavâra*n*â

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

ceremony--he ought not to issue command (to a junior, inhibiting him
from going beyond the bounds, or summoning him to appear before the
elders)--he ought not to set on foot a censure against any other
Bhikkhu--he ought not to ask another Bhikkhu to give him leave (to
rebuke that Bhikkhu)--he ought not to warn (another Bhikkhu whom he
supposes to be offending)--he ought not to remind (another Bhikkhu of a
law against which he supposes that Bhikkhu to be offending)--and he
ought not to associate with the Bhikkhus.'

Here end the forty-three duties which follow on an Ukkhepaniya-kamma for
not acknowledging a fault.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_660"></span>[372:1](sbe17137.htm#fr_674) As this chapter,
containing the sammâ-vattanâ or right conduct, differs from the
corresponding chapters of the preceding Kammas (chapters 5, 10, 15, and
21), it is here set out in full.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[372:2](sbe17137.htm#fr_678) See the passages
quoted above (chapter 5).

<span id="fn_662"></span>[372:3](sbe17137.htm#fr_682) The passage
between these two figures recurs at II, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_663"></span>[372:4](sbe17137.htm#fr_680) At II, 1, 1.
Buddhaghosa explains this word as confined to a stool on which to place
feet that have been washed (dhota-pâda-*th*apanaka*m*).

<span id="fn_664"></span>[372:5](sbe17137.htm#fr_681) Buddhaghosa says
on the same expression in II, 1, 1, pâdakathaliyan (sic) ti
adhota-pâda-*th*apanaka*m* pâda-gha*m*sana*m* vâ.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[372:6](sbe17137.htm#fr_683) The Samanta
Pâsâdikâ says, Na titthiya-dhago ti kusa*k*îrâdi*m* na dhâretabba*m*.

<span id="fn_666"></span>[372:7](sbe17137.htm#fr_684) The Samanta
