### 6.

1\. And the venerable Upâli <span id="fr_586"></span>[1](#fn_575.md) went
to the place where the Blessed One was. Having approached him and
respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him. Sitting near
him the venerable Upâli said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, if the Sa*m*gha,
regarding a matter which has given origin to altercations (&c., down
to:) to schisms among the Sa*m*gha, declares the re-establishment of
concord, without having inquired into that matter and without having got
to the bottom of it, is this declaration, Lord, lawful?'

'If the Sa*m*gha, Upâli, regarding a matter (&c., down to:) declares the
re-establishment of concord, without having inquired into that matter
and without having got to the bottom of it,--this declaration, Upâli, is
unlawful.'

'But if the Sa*m*gha, Lord, regarding a matter (&c., down to:) declares
the re-establishment of concord, after having inquired -into that matter
and after having got to the bottom of it,--is this declaration, Lord,
lawful?'

'If the Sa*m*gha, Upâli, (&c., down to:) declares the re-establishment
of concord, after having inquired

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

into that matter and after having got to the bottom of it,--this
declaration, Upâli, is lawful.'

2\. 'How many kinds are there, Lord, of the re-establishment of concord
among a Sâ*m*gha?'

'There are the following two kinds, Upâli, of re-establishment of
concord among a Sa*m*gha: Con-cord may be re-established, Upâli, in the
letter, but not in the spirit, and concord may be' re-established both
in the spirit and in the letter.

And in what case, Upâli, is concord re-established in the letter,' but
not in the spirit? If the Sa*m*gha, Upâli, (&c., as above) declares the
re-establishment of concord, without having inquired into that matter
and without having got to the bottom of it,--in this case, Upâli,
concord is said to have been re-established in the letter, but not in
the spirit.

'And in what case, Upâli, is concord re-established both in the spirit
and in the letter? If the Sa*m*gha. Upâli, (&c., as above) declares the
re-establishment of concord, after having inquired into that matter and
after having got to the bottom of it,--in this case, Upâli, concord is
said to have been re-established both in the spirit and in the letter.
These, Upâli, are the two kinds of re-establishment of concord among a
Sa*m*gha.'

3\. And the venerable Upâli rose from his seat, adjusted his upper robe
so as to cover one shoulder, bent his clasped hands towards the Blessed
One, and addressed the Blessed One in the following stanzas:

'In the affairs of the Sa*m*gha and in its consultations, in the
business that arises and in trials, what sort of man is then most
wanted? what Bhikkhu is then most worthy of the leadership?'

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

'Above all he who is blameless in his moral conduct, who watches over
his behaviour, whose senses are well controlled, whom his rivals do not
reprove according to the law,--for there is nothing for which they could
censure him,

'Such a man, who abides in blameless conduct, is well versed (in the
doctrine), and mighty are his words. He is not perplexed, nor does he
tremble, when he enters an assembly <span
id="fr_587"></span>[1](#fn_576.md). He does not disparage his cause by vain
talk.

'So also when he is asked questions in the assemblies, he does not
hesitate, and is not troubled. By his timely words, that solve the
questions, the clever man gladdens the assembly of the wise.

'Full of reverence for elder Bhikkhus, well versed in what his teacher
has taught him, able to find out (the right), a master of speech, and
skilled in making his rivals fail,

'By whom his rivals are annihilated, by whom many people receive
instruction,--he does not for-sake the cause he has taken up, (nor does
he become tired) of answering questions and putting questions without
hurting others;

'If he is charged with a mission, he takes it upon himself properly, and
in the business of the Sa*m*gha (he does) what they tell him <span
id="fr_588"></span>[2](#fn_577.md);--when a number of Bhikkhus despatches
him (somewhere), he obeys

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

their command, but he does not think therefrom, "It is I who do this;"--

'In what cases a Bhikkhu commits an offence, what an offence is, and how
it is atoned for, both these expositions are well known to him <span
id="fr_589"></span>[1](#fn_578.md); he is versed in the rules about offence
and atonement;--

'By what deeds a Bhikkhu brings expulsion upon himself, in what cases
one has been expelled, and the rehabilitation of a person who has
undergone that penance,--all this he also knows, well versed in the
Vibhaṅgas;--

'Full of reverence for elder Bhikkhus, for the young, for the Theras,
for the middle-aged, bringing welfare to many people, a clever
one:--such a Bhikkhu is the one who is then worthy of the leadership.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_575"></span>[322:1](sbe17111.htm#fr_586.md) See the note at
IX, 6, 1.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[324:1](sbe17111.htm#fr_587.md) The same idea is
put into the Buddha's mouth in the Mahâparinibbâna Sutta I, 23, 24.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[324:2](sbe17111.htm#fr_588.md) We propose to read
âhu na*m* yathâ. This seems more satisfactory than the reading and the
explanation found in Buddhaghosa's A*tth*akathâ: 'yathâ nâma âhuna*m*
âhutipi*nd*a*m* samugga*n*hanti (sic) eva*m* api so somanassa*g*âten’
eva *k*etasâ sa*m*ghassa ki*kk*esu samuggaho.'

<span id="fn_578"></span>[325:1](sbe17111.htm#fr_589.md) For 'Exposition'
the text has vibhaṅga, about the technical meaning of which see our
Introduction, pp. xv seq. 'Both' refers to the Bhikkhuvibhaṅga and
Bhikkhunîvibhaṅga. In the text, ubhayassa must be corrected into ubhay’
assa, i.e. ubhaye assa.
