### 16.

1\. Now after the Blessed One had remained at Sâvatthi as long as he
thought fit, he. went forth on his journey towards Râ*g*agaha. And on
the way the venerable Kaṅkhâ-revata saw a sugar factory, and on stepping
aside to it (he saw the men) putting flour and cane-dust into the
molasses. When he saw that he thought: 'Molasses mixed with food is not
permitted: it is not permitted to take such molasses (at a time) beyond
the time (for the daily meal).' And fearing to offend he ate not of it,
and his attendant Bhikkhus ate not, and such as held him worthy to be
heard, they ate not.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'Why, O Bhikkhus, do they put flour and cane-dust into molasses?'

'In order, Lord, to make it firm.'

'If, O Bhikkhus, they put flour and cane-dust into molasses to make it
firm, but it is still (nevertheless) considered to be molasses, I allow
you, O Bhikkhus, such molasses as much as you like.'

2\. Now the venerable Kaṅkhâ-revata saw on the way a kidney bean growing
out of a dung heap. And when he had seen it, he thought: 'Beans are not
permitted (to us, for) beans grow ready ripe <span

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

he did not eat, fearing to offend, and his attendant Bhikkhus did not
eat, and such as held him worthy to be heard, they also did not eat the
beans.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'Though, Bhikkhus, beans grow ready ripe, yet I allow you, O Bhikkhus,
to eat beans as much as you like.'

3\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu suffered from wind in the
stomach. He drank salt sour gruel; and thereby his sickness abated.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

I allow, O Bhikkhus, to one who is sick the use of salt sour gruel, to
one who is not sick the use thereof mixed with water <span
id="fr_168"></span>[1](#fn_166.md) as a beverage.'

because the beans required no cooking, but grew, ready to eat, of
themselves.
