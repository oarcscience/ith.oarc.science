### 27.

And the Blessed One, wandering from place to place, came to Râ*g*agaha.
There the Blessed One dwelt near Râ*g*agaha, in the Ve*l*uvana, at
Kalandakanivâpa. At that time the Bhikkhus at Râ*g*agaha had plenty of
sugar. The Bhikkhus feared to offend (and thought): 'The Blessed One has
allowed the eating of sugar only to the sick and not to the healthy,'
and therefore they did not eat sugar.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, to the sick the eating of sugar, and to the
healthy the drinking of sugar-water.'
