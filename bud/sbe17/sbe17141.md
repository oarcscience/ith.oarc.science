### 31.

Now at that time the Blessed Buddha was dwelling at Kosambî, in the
Ghosita Ârâma. And at that time the venerable *Kh*anna, when he had
committed a fault, was not willing to atone for that fault \[&c., the
proceeding in this case being the same, and laid down in the same words
as the proceeding in the last case, chapters 25-30\].

Here ends the sixth Kamma; namely, the Ukkhepaniya-kamma on not atoning

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_668"></span>[376:1](sbe17141.htm#fr_686) It will be seen
from the above chapters, and especially from chapter 27, that the
Ukkhepaniya-kamma is an Act, not of expulsion, but only of suspension.
The ten cases in which a member of the Order could be expelled are those
given above in Mahâvagga I, 60; and the technical word for 'expel' is
nâseti.
