### 14.

1\. Now at that time the venerable Pilindava*kkh*a was troubled with
wind in the stomach <span id="fr_138"></span>[1](#fn_136.md). The
physicians said he must drink oil.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, a decoction of oil.'

It was necessary to put strong drink into the decoction.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to put strong drink in decoctions of oil.'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to put too much strong
drink into their decoctions of medicinal oils: and they got drunk.

'Oil should not be drunk, O Bhikkhus, when too much strong drink has
been put into it. Whosoever does so, shall be dealt with according to
law <span id="fr_139"></span>[2](#fn_137.md).'

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to drink such decoctions

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

of oil with strong drink in them, as wherein neither the colour, nor the
smell, nor the taste of the strong drink shall be sensible.'

2\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus had a quantity of decoction in which
too much strong drink had been put. Then those Bhikkhus thought: 'What
shall we do with this oil, which has too much strong drink in it?'

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, to use it as an ointment.'

Now at that time the venerable Pilindava*kkh*a had a quantity of
oil-decoction; but he had no vessel for it.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of three kinds of pots, bronze pots,
wooden pots, pots made of the shells of fruits <span
id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_138.md).'

3\. Now at that time the venerable Pilindava*kkh*a had rheumatism.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to bring on sweating <span
id="fr_141"></span>[2](#fn_139.md).'

(The disease) became no better.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to bring on sweating by the use of herbs which
have that effect <span id="fr_142"></span>[3](#fn_140.md).'

(The disease) became no better.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a great steam bath <span
id="fr_143"></span>[4](#fn_141.md).'

(The disease) became no better.

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of hemp-water (bang) <span
id="fr_144"></span>[1](#fn_142.md).'

(The disease) became no better.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of hot baths in water in which
medicinal herbs have been steeped <span id="fr_145"></span>[2](#fn_143.md).

4\. Now at that time the venerable Pilindava*kkh*a had intermittent
ague.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the letting of blood.'

(The disease) became no better.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make use of a horn to let blood <span
id="fr_146"></span>[3](#fn_144.md).'

Now at that time the feet of the venerable Pilindava*kkh*a were
blistered.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of ointment for the feet.'

(The disease) became no better.

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to keep water ready for washing the feet (of
travellers) <span id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_145.md).'

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had boils.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of the lancet.'

Decoctions of astringent herbs were required.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, decoctions of astringent herbs <span
id="fr_148"></span>[2](#fn_146.md).'

Sesamum salve was required.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of sesamum salve <span
id="fr_149"></span>[3](#fn_147.md).'

5\. Compresses were required.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of compresses <span
id="fr_150"></span>[4](#fn_148.md).'

It was necessary to tie up the sore with cloth.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of bandages for tieing up wounds.'

The sore itched.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the sprinkling of a sore with mustard-powder <span
id="fr_151"></span>[5](#fn_149.md).'

The sore became moist <span id="fr_152"></span>[6](#fn_150.md).

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to fumigate (the sore).'

Proud flesh formed on the wound <span id="fr_153"></span>[7](#fn_151.md).

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to cut off (proud flesh) with a lancet.'

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

The wound would not close up.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of oil for wounds.'

The oil ran over.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of fine rags <span
id="fr_154"></span>[1](#fn_152.md), and of all kinds of ways of treating
wounds.'

6\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu was bitten by a snake.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the four kinds of filth to be given--dung, urine,
ashes, and clay.'

Now the Bhikkhus thought: 'Are these things among those which may be
taken even without being offered to us by others, or among things which
cannot be taken unless they are offered?'

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I allow these things, O Bhikkhus, to be accepted if any one be there to
offer them <span id="fr_155"></span>[2](#fn_153.md), and if not, then that
you may take them yourselves and use them.'

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had drunk poison.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to give (as an emetic) a decoction of dung.'

Then the Bhikkhus thought: 'Is this among those things which may be
taken even without being offered to us by others, or is it among things
which cannot be taken unless they are offered?'

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I rule, O Bhikkhus, that there is a proper taking when a man takes what
he himself has made; and

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

that such a thing need not be received again from others.'

7\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu suffered from the
ghara-dinnaka <span id="fr_156"></span>[1](#fn_154.md) disease.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to give him to drink a decoction of soil
turned up by the plough <span id="fr_157"></span>[2](#fn_155.md).'&lt;

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had constipation <span
id="fr_158"></span>[3](#fn_156.md).

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to give him a decoction of the ashes of burnt
rice <span id="fr_159"></span>[4](#fn_157.md).'

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had the jaundice.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to give to drink a decoction made with (cows')
urine <span id="fr_160"></span>[5](#fn_158.md).'

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had skin disease.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the anointing with perfumes.'

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had a superfluity of humors in his
body <span id="fr_161"></span>[6](#fn_159.md).'

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to give a purgative.'

Clarified gruel was required.

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of clarified gruel.'

Natural juice was required <span id="fr_162"></span>[1](#fn_160.md).

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of natural juice.'

Artificial and natural juice was required <span
id="fr_163"></span>[2](#fn_161.md).

I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of artificial and natural juice.'

Meat broth was required <span id="fr_164"></span>[3](#fn_162.md).

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of meat broth.'

leaves on the affected limb, which has been rubbed over with oil; and

extremity, and with a small opening at the narrow end.' Compare

end).

<span id="fn_145"></span>[58:1](sbe17028.htm#fr_147.md) This would seem to
be a preventive remedy. Water may be kept ready, so that the incoming
Bhikkhus may use it, and their feet therefore may not become blistered.
But perhaps pa*gg*a here means some curative application of water to the
feet, such as cold water bandages, for example. Compresses (?poultices)
are mentioned below (§ 5) for boils.
