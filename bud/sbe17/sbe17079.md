### 12.

1\. Now when the Blessed One had remained at Râ*g*agaha as long as he
thought fit, he set forth on his journey towards Dakkhi*n*â-giri (the
Southern Hills <span id="fr_363"></span>[2](#fn_358).md). And the Blessed
One beheld how the Magadha rice fields were divided into short
pieces <span id="fr_364"></span>[3](#fn_359.md),

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

and in rows <span id="fr_365"></span>[1](#fn_360.md), and by outside
boundaries <span id="fr_366"></span>[2](#fn_361) (or ridges.md), and by
cross boundaries <span id="fr_367"></span>[3](#fn_362.md).

On seeing this the Blessed One spake thus to the venerable Ânanda: 'Dost
thou perceive, Ânanda, how the Magadha rice fields are divided into
short pieces, and in rows, and by outside boundaries, and by cross
boundaries?'

'Even so, Lord.'

'Could you, Ânanda, provide <span id="fr_368"></span>[4](#fn_363.md) robes
of a like kind for the Bhikkhus?'

'I could, Lord.'

Now when the Blessed One had remained in the Southern Hills as long as
he thought fit, he returned again to Râ*g*agaha.

Then Ânanda provided robes of a like kind for many Bhikkhus; and going
up to the place where the Blessed One was, he spake thus to the Blessed
One: 'May the Blessed One be pleased to look at the robes which I have
provided.'

2\. Then the Blessed One on that occasion addressed the Bhikkhus and
said: 'An able man, O Bhikkhus, is Ânanda; of great understanding, O
Bhikkhus, is Ânanda, inasmuch as what has been spoken by me in short
that can he understand in full, and can make the cross seams <span
id="fr_369"></span>[5](#fn_364.md), and the

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

intermediate cross seams <span id="fr_370"></span>[1](#fn_365.md), and the
greater circles <span id="fr_371"></span>[2](#fn_366.md), and the lesser
circles <span id="fr_372"></span>[3](#fn_367.md), and the turning in <span
id="fr_373"></span>[4](#fn_368.md), and the lining of the turning in <span
id="fr_374"></span>[5](#fn_369.md), and the collar piece <span
id="fr_375"></span>[6](#fn_370.md), and the knee piece <span
id="fr_376"></span>[7](#fn_371.md), and the elbow piece <span
id="fr_377"></span>[8](#fn_372.md). And it shall be of torn pieces <span
id="fr_378"></span>[9](#fn_373.md), roughly sewn together <span
id="fr_379"></span>[10](#fn_374.md), suitable for a Sama*n*a, a thing which
his enemies cannot covet <span id="fr_380"></span>[11](#fn_375.md). I
enjoin upon you, O Bhikkhus, the use of an under robe of torn pieces,
and of an upper robe of torn pieces, and of a waist cloth of torn
pieces <span id="fr_381"></span>[12](#fn_376.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_358"></span>[207:2](sbe17079.htm#fr_363.md) These are always
mentioned in connection with Râ*g*agaha (Mahâvagga I, 53 *K*ullavagga
XI, 1-10), and are probably the name of the mountainous district
immediately south of Râ*g*agaha.

<span id="fn_359"></span>[207:3](sbe17079.htm#fr_364.md) A*kk*ibaddhan
(sic) ti *k*aturassakedârakabaddha*m* (B.). I have never seen a field
divided 'ray-fashion,' which would apparently be the literal translation
of the term, and it is difficult to see how the necessary water could be
conducted from strip to strip of a field so divided. Buddhaghosa also,
though his explanation is insufficient, evidently does not take a*kk*i
in the ordinary sense (Rh. D.).

Mahâ-atthakathâya*m* vutto ti (B.). This latter explanation from bâhâ
seems evidently more correct than the other one from bahi; and we
accordingly follow it.

<span id="fn_373"></span>[209:9](sbe17079.htm#fr_378.md) See the end of the
last chapter.

<span id="fn_374"></span>[209:10](sbe17079.htm#fr_379.md) Satta-lûkha; in
which compound the signification of satta is by no means clear.
Buddhaghosa has no note upon it. Now it is curious that in chapter 21,
below, it is laid down that the robe is to be sutta-lûkha, the meaning
of which would fit this passage excellently. We have accordingly adopted
that reading here.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[209:11](sbe17079.htm#fr_380.md) Compare the
similar expressions at *G*âtaka I, 8 and 9.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[209:12](sbe17079.htm#fr_381.md) The general sense
of this chapter is clear enough. As an Indian field, the common property
of the village community, was <span id="page_210">p. 210</span> divided,
for the purposes of cultivation, across and across, so must also the
Bhikkhu's robe be divided. That some, both of the agricultural and of
the tailoring terms, should now be unintelligible to us is not
surprising. Buddhaghosa himself, as the extracts from his commentary
show, was not certain of the meaning of them all.
