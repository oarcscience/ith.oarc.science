<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ka*th*ina
continues to exist, and on the failing of these two conditions it is
lost <span id="fr_335"></span>[1](#fn_330).

'And which are the two conditions, O Bhikkhus, for the continued
existence of that claim? The condition regarding the residence, and the
condition regarding the robe.

'And which, O Bhikkhus, is the condition regarding the residence? A
Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, goes away (for a time), when it is raining or
storming, with the intention of returning to that residence. In this
case, O Bhikkhus, the condition regarding the residence is fulfilled.
And which, O Bhikkhus, is the condition that regards the robe? A
Bhikkhu's robe, O Bhikkhus, is not made up, or not ready, or his
expectation of getting a robe has ceased. In this case, O Bhikkhus, the
condition regarding the robe is fulfilled. These, O Bhikkhus, are the
two conditions for the continued existence of the claim.

2\. 'And which, O Bhikkhus, is the failing of the two conditions by
which the claim is lost? The failing of the condition regarding the
residence, and the failing of the condition regarding the robe.

'And in which case, O Bhikkhus, does the condition regarding the
residence fail?

'A Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, goes away from the residence, giving it up,
turning away from it with contempt, abandoning it, with the intention of
not returning. In this case, O Bhikkhus, the condition regarding the
residence fails. And in which case, O Bhikkhus, does the condition
regarding the robe

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

fail? A Bhikkhu's robe, O Bhikkhus, has been made up, or spoilt, or
lost, or burnt, or his expectation of getting a robe has ceased. In
these cases, O Bhikkhus, the condition regarding the robe fails. This is
the failing of the two conditions, O Bhikkhus, by which the claim is
lost.'
