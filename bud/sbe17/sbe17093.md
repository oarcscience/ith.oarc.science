### 26.

1\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had a disturbance in his bowels,
and he lay fallen in his own evacuations. And the Blessed One on going
round the sleeping-places accompanied by the venerable Ânanda came to
that Bhikkhu's abode, and saw him so. And he went up to him, and asked
him, 'What is the matter with you, O Bhikkhu?'

'I have a disturbance, Lord, in my bowels.'

'Then have you, O Bhikkhu, any one to wait upon you?'

'No, Lord.'

'Why do not the Bhikkhus wait upon you?'

'Because I am of no service, Lord, to the Bhikkhus.'

2\. Then the Blessed One said to the venerable

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ânanda: 'Go,
Ânanda, and fetch some water. Let us bathe this Bhikkhu.'

'Even so, Lord,' said the venerable Ânanda, in assent to the Blessed
One, and fetched the water. And the Blessed One poured the water over
that Bhikkhu; and the venerable Ânanda wiped him down. And the Blessed
One taking hold of him at the head, and the venerable Ânanda at the
feet, they lifted him up, and laid him down upon his bed.

3\. Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection,
convened a meeting of the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha, and asked the Bhikkhus, 'Is
there, O Bhikkhus, in such and such an apartment, a Bhikkhu who is
sick?'

'There is, Lord.'

'Then what, O Bhikkhus, is the matter with that Bhikkhu?'

'He has a disturbance, Lord, in his bowels.'

'And is there any one, O Bhikkhus, to wait upon him?'

'No, Lord.'

Why, then, do not the Bhikkhus wait upon him?'

'That Bhikkhu, Lord, is of no service to the Bhikkhus; therefore do they
not wait upon him.'

'Ye, O Bhikkhus, have no mothers and no fathers who might wait upon you!
If ye, O Bhikkhus, wait not one upon the other, who is there indeed who
will wait upon you? Whosoever, O Bhikkhus, would wait upon me, he should
wait upon the sick.

4\. 'If he have an upa*ggh*âya, his upa*ggh*âya should wait upon him as
long as his life lasts, and wait until he has recovered; and so if he
have an â*k*ariya, a saddhi-vihârika, an antevâsika, a fellow

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

saddhi-vihârika, or a fellow antevâsika <span
id="fr_462"></span>[1](#fn_454.md). And if he have neither of all these,
then should the Sa*m*gha wait upon him; and whosoever does not do so,
shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.

5\. 'There are five qualities, O Bhikkhus, which, when a sick man has,
he is difficult to wait upon--when he does not do what is good for him;
when he does not know the limit (of the quantity of food) that is good
for him  <span id="fr_463"></span>[2](#fn_455.md); when he does not take
his medicine; when he does not let a nurse who desires his good know
what manner of disease he has, or when it is getting worse that that is
so, or when it is getting better that that is so, or when it is
stationary that that is so; and when he has become unable to bear bodily
pains that are severe, sharp, grievous, disagreeable, unpleasant, and
destructive to life <span id="fr_464"></span>[3](#fn_456.md). These are the
five qualities, O Bhikkhus, which, when a sick man has, he is difficult
to wait upon.

6\. 'There are five qualities, O Bhikkhus, which, when a sick man has,
he is easy to wait upon--when he does' (&c., the contrary of the last
section).

7\. 'There are five qualities, O Bhikkhus, which, when one who waits
upon the sick has, he is incompetent to the task--when he is not capable
of prescribing medicines; when he does not know what (diet) is good and
what is not good for the patient, serving what is not good, and not
serving what is good for him; when he waits upon the sick out of

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

greed, and not out of love; when he revolts from removing evacuations,
saliva or vomit; when he is not capable from time to time of teaching,
inciting, arousing, and gladdening the patient with religious discourse.
These are the five qualities, O Bhikkhus, which, when one who waits upon
the sick has, he is incompetent to the task.

8\. 'There are five qualities, O Bhikkhus, which, when one who waits
upon the sick has, he is competent to the task--when he is capable'
(&c., the contrary of the last section).
