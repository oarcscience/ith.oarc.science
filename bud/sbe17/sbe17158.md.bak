1\. When he had passed through the probation he told the Bhikkhus,
saying, 'I committed, friends, an offence--the first
Sa*m*ghâdisesa--which for one day I concealed. I asked the Sa*m*gha to
impose upon me a probation of one day for the offence . . . . concealed.
The Sa*m*gha imposed . . . . concealed. I have passed through that
probation. What now should I do?'

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'Let then the Sa*m*gha impose upon Udâyi the Bhikkhu a Mânatta of six
days' duration.'
