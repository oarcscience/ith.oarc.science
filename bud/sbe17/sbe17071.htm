Some of these Bhikkhus went off (the road) to a cemetery in order to get themselves pa<I>m</I>suk&ucirc;la robes; some (other) Bhikkhus did not wait. Those Bhikkhus who had gone to the cemetery for pa<I>m</I>suk&ucirc;la robes, got themselves pa<I>m</I>suk&ucirc;las; those Bhikkhus who had not waited, said to them: 'Friends, give us also a part (of your pa<I>m</I>suk&ucirc;las).' They replied, 'We will not give you a part, friends; why have you not waited?'</p>

<p>of these Bhikkhus went off (the road) to a cemetery in order to get themselves pa<I>m</I>suk&ucirc;la robes; some (other) Bhikkhus waited for them.

They replied, 'We will not give you a part, friends; why did you not also go off (to the cemetery)?'</p>  
<p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you give a part (even) against your will to Bhikkhus who have waited.'</p>  
<p>3. At that time a number of Bhikkhus were travelling on the road in the Kosala country. Some of these Bhikkhus went aside first from (the road) to a cemetery in order to get themselves pa<I>m</I>suk&ucirc;la robes; some (other) Bhikkhus went aside later. Those Bhikkhus who had gone first to the cemetery for pa<I>m</I>suk&ucirc;la robes, got themselves pa<I>m</I>suk&ucirc;las; those Bhikkhus who had got off later, did not get any, and said (to the other ones): 'Friends, give us also a part.' They replied, 'We will not give you a part, friends; why did you get off (to the cemetery) after us?'</p>  
<p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you are not obliged to give a part against your will to Bhikkhus who have gone (to the cemetery) later (than yourselves).'</p>

<p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you give a part (even) against your will to Bhikkhus who have gone (to the cemetery) together with yourselves.'</p>  
<p>5. At that time a number of Bhikkhus were travelling on the road in the Kosala country. They went off (the road) to a cemetery in order to get themselves pa<I>m</I>suk&ucirc;la robes, after having made an agreement (about the distribution of what they were to find). Some of the Bhikkhus got themselves pa<I>m</I>suk&ucirc;las, other Bhikkhus did not get any. The Bhikkhus who had got nothing, said: 'Friends, give us also a part (of the pa<I>m</I>suk&ucirc;las).' They replied, 'We will not give you a part, friends; why did you not get (them yourselves)?'</p>
