### 33.

1\. 'And in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu is guilty of a number of
Sa*m*ghâdisesa offences, definite, and not concealed--not definite, and
not concealed--of one designation, and not concealed--of various
designations, and not concealed--similar, and not concealed--dissimilar,
and not concealed--connected <span id="fr_763"></span>[1](#fn_741.md), and
not concealed--disconnected, and not concealed--and then throws off the
robes <span id="fr_764"></span>[2](#fn_742.md).' . . .

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_741"></span>[431:1](sbe17186.htm#fr_763.md) On the opposition
of vavatthita and sambhinna, compare Minayeff Pâtimokkha, p. 29, where
these two expressions are used of language.

<span id="fn_742"></span>[431:2](sbe17186.htm#fr_764.md) The chapter is
translated as it stands. To supply the implications involved, the words
'a Bhikkhu' at the beginning should be understood as 'a Bhikkhu
undergoing probation, or liable to the Mânatta discipline, or undergoing
the Mânatta discipline, or fit to be rehabilitated.' And the conclusion
should be supplied as in chap. 28, except that the penalty in each case
is not an additional probation, but a probation corresponding in length
to the period which has elapsed since the first of those offences which
the re-ordained Bhikkhu has concealed (either before or after the second
ordination). The details are only worked out, in chap. 28, of the first
of the several pairs here enumerated, and are intended to be supplied
here for each of the other pairs in a similar way. All the pairs recur
in chaps. 35, 36.
