<p>Then those Bhikkhus told that matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>And the Blessed One on that occasion, and in that connection, convened a meeting of the Bhikkhusa<I>m</I>gha, and asked the Bhikkhus, 'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, as they say, that the venerable Seyyasaka is stupid (&amp;c., as before, down to) with rehabilitating him?'</p>  
<p>'It is true, Lord!'</p>  
<p>The Blessed Buddha rebuked him (saying), 'This is improper' (&amp;c., as usual, compare I, 2, 3, down to), and addressed the Bhikkhus, and said, 'Let the Sa<I>m</I>gha therefore, O Bhikkhus, carry out the Nissaya-kamma (Act of Subordination) against the venerable Seyyasaka: "Thou must remain under the superintendence of others&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_628"></A><A HREF="#fn_616"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>."</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_610"></A><A HREF="sbe17120.htm#fr_622">343:1</A> There is no rule in the P&acirc;timokkha in which any of these things are declared to be an offence. The 31st and 85th P&acirc;<I>k</I>ittiyas only refer to a Bhikkhu's staying an unreasonable time in a public rest-house, and to his frequenting a village beyond the ordinary occasions. Stupidity, and keeping low company, are not mentioned. Why then should Seyyasaka have been placed upon probation? We think the answer will appear from our note I on II, I, X.</P>
