### 3.

And in the forenoon the Blessed One, having put on his under-robes, took
up his alms-bowl and his *k*îvara, and entered the town of Kosambî for
alms. Having collected alms in Kosambî, after his meal, when he had
returned from his alms-pilgrimage, he put his resting-place in order,
took up his alms-bowl and his *k*îvara, and standing in the midst of the
assembly he pronounced the following stanzas:

'Loud is the noise that ordinary men make. Nobody thinks himself a fool,
when divisions arise in the Sa*m*gha, nor do they ever value another
person higher (than themselves).

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

'Bewildered <span id="fr_564"></span>[1](#fn_554) are (even.md) the clever
words of him who is versed in the resources of eloquence. As wide as
they like they open their mouth. By whom they are lead they do not see.

'"He <span id="fr_565"></span>[2](#fn_555.md) has reviled me, he has beaten
me, he has oppressed me, he has robbed me,"--in those who nurse such
thoughts, hatred will never be appeased.

'"He has reviled me, he has beaten me, he has oppressed me, he has
robbed me,"--in those who do not nurse such thoughts, hatred is
appeased.

'For not by hatred is hatred ever appeased; by not-hatred it is
appeased; this is an eternal law.

'The others <span id="fr_566"></span>[3](#fn_556.md) do not know that we
must keep ourselves under restraint here; but those who know it, their
quarrels are appeased.

'They whose bones are broken (by their foes), who destroy lives, who rob
cows, horses, and treasures, who plunder realms,--even these may find
conciliation. How should you not find it?

'If <span id="fr_567"></span>[4](#fn_557.md) a man find a wise friend, a
companion who

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

lives righteously, a constant one, he may walk with him, overcoming all
dangers, happy and mindful <span id="fr_568"></span>[1](#fn_558.md).

'If he find no wise friend, no companion who lives righteously, no
constant one, let him walk alone, like a king who leaves his conquered
realm behind <span id="fr_569"></span>[2](#fn_559.md), like an elephant in
the elephant forest <span id="fr_570"></span>[3](#fn_560.md).

'It is better to walk alone; with a fool there is no companionship. Let
a man walk alone; let him do no evil, free from cares, like an elephant
in the elephant forest <span id="fr_571"></span>[3](#fn_560.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_554"></span>[307:1](sbe17108.htm#fr_564.md) Parimu*tth*â.
Buddhaghosa: 'Parimu*tth*â ’ti mu*tth*assatino.' Mu*tth*assati cannot be
connected with mû*lh*a, as Childers supposes, but it is evidently
mushitasmi*ri*ti (Kathâsarits. 56, 289; compare satisammosa, Mil.
Pa*ñ*ha, p. 266). Thus it appears that parimu*tth*a must be derived also
from the root mush.

<span id="fn_555"></span>[307:2](sbe17108.htm#fr_565.md) These verses are
inserted in the Dhammapada, vv. 3-6.

<span id="fn_556"></span>[307:3](sbe17108.htm#fr_566.md) That is to say,
those who do not follow the Buddha's teaching. On this meaning of pare
compare parappavâdâ at Mahâ-parinibbâna Sutta V, 62. Professor Max
Müller, who in the first edition of his translation of the Dhammapada
(Buddhaghosa's Parables, p. lvi) has 'Some do not know that we must all
come to an end here,' in the revised edition (Sacred Books of the East,
vol. x) renders the phrase, 'The world does not know that we must all
come to an end here.'

<span id="fn_557"></span>[307:4](sbe17108.htm#fr_567.md) The following
three verses have also been inserted in the Dhammapada, vv. 328-330. The
two first recur in the Khaggavisâna-sutta of the Sutta Nipâta, vv. 11,
12.

<span id="fn_558"></span>[308:1](sbe17108.htm#fr_568.md) On the
juxtaposition of happiness with mindfulness, see the constantly repeated
phrase occurring, for instance, in the Tevi*gg*a Sutta I, 49 (at the
end). It would perhaps be better to read satîmâ in the text, as Fausböll
has done, metri causâ.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[308:2](sbe17108.htm#fr_569.md) That is, who
abdicates, and devotes himself in the forest to a hermit's life. This is
given as the crucial instance of a happy life in the *G*âtaka Story, No.
10.

<span id="fn_560"></span>[308:3](sbe17108.htm#fr_571.md) Professor Fausböll
reads in both verses mâtaṅgara*ññ*o instead of mâtaṅgara*ññ*e.
