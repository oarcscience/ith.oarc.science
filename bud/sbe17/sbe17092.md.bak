### 25.

1\. Now at that time the venerable Upananda of the Sakya race, having
spent the rainy season at Sâvatthi, went to take up his abode in a
certain village. The Bhikkhus in that place assembled together with the
object of dividing the robes. They said to him

'These robes, friend, which are the property of the Sa*m*gha, are about
to be divided. Will you accept a share of them?'

'Yes, friends, I will,' said he; and taking his share, departed thence
and took up his abode elsewhere.

\[The same thing happened there, and\] he departed thence and took up
his abode elsewhere.

\[The same thing happened there, and so\] he returned to Sâvatthi with a
great bundle of robes.

2\. The Bhikkhus said to him: 'What a meritorious

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

of the robes be assigned to Upananda of the Sakya race?'

They told the matter to the Blessed One.

'Give, O Bhikkhus, to that foolish one but one portion <span
id="fr_461"></span>[1](sbe17093.htm#fn_453.md). In case, O Bhikkhus, a
Bhikkhu spend the rainy season alone in two residences, thinking thus to
obtain many robes, then, if he have spent exactly half the season in one
place and half in another, a half portion of the robes due to him shall
be given to him in one place, and a half in the other; but in whichever
place of the two he have spent a greater part of the rainy season,
thence shall the portions of robes due to him be given.'

<span id="fn_451"></span>[238:1](sbe17091.htm#fr_459.md) There is a
Sâ*n*avâsi who takes a prominent part at the Council of Vesâlî
(*K*ullavagga XII, 1, 8; XII, 2, 4). He is probably meant to be
considered the same as this one.

person you are, friend Upananda. Plenty of robes have come into your
possession!'

'Where is my merit, friends?' said he, and \[told them all that had
happened\] <span id="fr_460"></span>[1](#fn_452.md).

3\. 'How then, friend Upananda, have you spent the rainy season in one
place, and accepted a share of robes in another place?'

'Yes, friends, that is so.'

Those Bhikkhus who were moderate were indignant, murmured, and became
annoyed, saying, 'How can the venerable Upananda spend the rainy season
in one place, and accept a share of robes in another place?'

They told the matter to the Blessed One.

'Is it true, Upananda, as they say, that you have spent the rainy season
in one place, and have accepted a share of robes in another place?'

'It is true, Lord.'

The Blessed Buddha rebuked him, saying, 'How can you, O foolish one, act
so? This will not redound to the conversion of the unconverted, or to
the increase of the converted!'

And after having rebuked him, and delivered a religious discourse, he
addressed the Bhikkhus, saying, 'Whosoever, O Bhikkhus, has spent the
rainy season in one place, is not to accept a share of the robes in
another place. Whosoever does so shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

4\. Now at that time the venerable Upananda of the Sakya race spent the
rainy season alone in two residences, thinking thus to obtain many
robes. And the Bhikkhus thought: 'How should his portion

repeated, with the necessary change of person, &c.
