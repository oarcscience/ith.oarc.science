### 35.

1\. 'And in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu is guilty of a number of
Sa*m*ghâdisesa offences--definite, and not definite--of one designation,
and of various designations--similar to each other, and
dissimilar--connected with each other, and disconnected <span

probation on account of those offences <span
id="fr_773"></span>[2](#fn_750.md). The Sa*m*gha imposes upon him an
inclusive probation on account of those offences. He undergoing that
probation is guilty meanwhile of a number of Sa*m*ghâdisesa offences,
definite ones, which he does not conceal. He asks the Sa*m*gha to throw
him back on account of those intervening offences to the commencement
(of his term of probation). The Sa*m*gha \[does so\] by a lawful
proceeding that cannot be quashed <span id="fr_774"></span>[3](#fn_751.md),
and fit

for the occasion; and it also imposes a Mânatta upon him, but by an
unlawful proceeding, and then by an unlawful proceeding rehabilitates
him. That Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, is not purified from those offences.

\[The same decision is given if, of the intervening offences, all of
which are definite, some have been concealed, and some not concealed.\]

2\. \[The same if the intervening offences have been not definite and
not concealed, or not definite and concealed, or all not definite but
some concealed and some not concealed, or, all not concealed but some
definite and some not definite, or all concealed

but some definite and some not definite, or some definite and some not
definite and some concealed and some not concealed.\]

Here end the nine principal cases (which serve as  
a basis for the variations in the following  
chapter) in which a Bhikkhu is not  
purified (by undergoing a  
term of probation).

<span id="fn_749"></span>[435:1](sbe17188.htm#fr_772.md) See chap. 33 for
this list.

<span id="fn_750"></span>[435:2](sbe17188.htm#fr_773.md) In accordance with
the rule laid down in chap. 28, which shows that by 'a Bhikkhu' must be
understood 'a Bhikkhu who is under probation;' and the offences he has
committed must have been concealed by him.

technical term kamma*m* kopeti is not to revoke the valid decision of a
kamma regularly held, but to show that the kamma by reason of some
irregularity was no real kamma, and its whole proceedings therefore
void. One may compare akuppâ me *k*eto-vimutti spoken by the Buddha
immediately after he had attained Nirvâ*n*a under the Bo Tree
(Ariyapariyosâna Sutta in H. O.'s 'Buddha,' p. 429) and the opposite
idea in Sutta Nipâta IV, 3, 5.
