1\. 'Now, thus, O Bhikkhus, should the revocation be carried out. Those
Bhikkhus who are followers of Pa*nd*uka and Lohitaka should go before
the Sa*m*gha, with their upper robe arranged over one shoulder, and
should bow down at the feet of the elder Bhikkhus, and squatting down,
and raising their hands with the palms joined together, should speak as
follows: "We, Sirs, have been subjected by the Sa*m*gha to the
Ta*gg*aniya-kamma, and are conducting ourselves aright in accordance
thereto; and we have become subdued, and we seek for release, and beg
for a revocation of the Ta*gg*aniya-kamma."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And a second time
they should beg \[in the same words\]. And a third time they should beg
\[in the same words\]. Then a discreet and able Bhikkhu should lay the
matter before the Sa*m*gha:

2\. '"Let the venerable Sa*m*gha hear me. These Bhikkhus who are
followers of Pa*nd*uka and Lohitaka have been subjected (&c., as
before), and they are conducting themselves (&c., as before), and they
beg (&c., as before).

'"This is the motion (*ñ*atti).

'"Let the venerable Sa*m*gha hear me. These Bhikkhus (&c., as before,
down to) and they beg for a revocation of the Ta*gg*aniya-kamma. The
Sa*m*gha revokes the Ta*gg*aniya-kamma for the Bhikkhus who are
followers of Pa*nd*uka and Lohitaka. Whosoever of the venerable ones
approves of the revocation of the Ta*gg*aniya-kamma for the Bhikkhus who
are followers of Pa*nd*uka and Lohitaka, let him hold his peace.
Whosoever approves not thereof, let him speak.

'"And a second time I say the same thing. Let the venerable Sa*m*gha
(&c., as before, down to) let him speak.

'"And a third time I say the same thing. Let the venerable Sa*m*gha
(&c., as before, down to) let him speak.

'"The revocation of the Ta*gg*aniya-kamma for the Bhikkhus who are
followers of Pa*nd*uka and Lohitaka has been carried by the Sa*m*gha.
The Sa*m*gha approves; therefore is it silent. Thus do I understand."'

Here ends the first (Kamma), the Ta*gg*aniya-kamma.
