### 6.

1\. And the venerable Upâli <span id="fr_529"></span>[1](#fn_520.md) went
to the place where the Blessed One was. Having approached him and
respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him. Sitting near
him the venerable Upâli said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, if a complete
congregation performs an act at which the presence (of the accused
Bhikkhu) is required, in his absence--is this act, Lord, performed
lawfully according to Dhamma and Vinaya?'

'It is performed, Upâli, unlawfully against Dhamma and Vinaya.'

2\. 'Lord, if a complete congregation performs an act at which (the
accused Bhikkhu) ought to be called upon for an answer, without calling
upon him for an answer--if it performs an act at which the confession
(of the culprit) is required, without his confession--if it grants to a
Bhikkhu to whom sativinaya <span id="fr_530"></span>[2](#fn_521.md) ought
to be granted, an amû*lh*avinaya <span
id="fr_531"></span>[3](#fn_522.md)--if it proceeds against a Bhikkhu to
whom amû*lh*avinaya ought to be granted, with the
tassapâpiyyasikâkamma <span id="fr_532"></span>[4](#fn_523.md)--if it
proceeds against a Bhikkhu against whom the tassapâpiyyasikâkamma ought

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

to be instituted, with the ta*gg*aniyakamma <span
id="fr_533"></span>[1](#fn_524.md)--if it proceeds against a Bhikkhu
against whom the ta*gg*aniyakamma ought to be instituted, with the
nissayakamma--if it proceeds against a Bhikkhu against whom the
nissayakamma ought to be instituted, with the pabbâ*g*aniyakamma--if it
proceeds against a Bhikkhu against whom the pabbâ*g*aniyakamma ought to
be instituted, with the pa*t*isâra*n*iyakamma--if it proceeds against a
Bhikkhu against whom the pa*t*isâra*n*iyakamma ought to be instituted,
with the ukkhepaniyakamma--if it sentences a Bhikkhu against whom the
ukkhepaniyakamma ought to be instituted, to parivâsa <span
id="fr_534"></span>[2](#fn_525.md)--if it sentences a Bhikkhu who ought to
be sentenced to parivâsa, to mûlâya pa*t*ikassanâ--if it sentences a
Bhikkhu who ought to be sentenced to mûlâya pa*t*ikassanâ, to
mânatta--if it grants to a Bhikkhu who ought to be sentenced to mânatta,
the decree of abbhâna--if it confers on a Bhikkhu to whom abbhâna ought
to be granted, the upasampadâ ordination,--is this act, Lord, performed
lawfully according to Dhamma and Vinaya?'

3\. 'It is performed, Upâli, unlawfully against Dhamma and Vinaya. If a
complete congregation, Upâli, performs an act at which the presence (of
the accused Bhikkhu) is required, in his absence (&c., down to:) confers
on a Bhikkhu to whom abbhâna ought to be granted, the upasampadâ
ordination,--in such case, Upâli, this act is performed unlawfully
against Dhamma and Vinaya, and in such case this Sa*m*gha trespasses
against the law.'

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

4\. 'Lord, if a complete congregation performs an act at which the
presence (of the accused Bhikkhu) is required, in his presence (&c.,
down to:) confers on a person, on whom the upasampadâ ordination ought
to be conferred, the upasampadâ ordination,--is this act, Lord,
performed lawfully according to Dhamma and Vinaya?'

It is performed, Upâli, lawfully according to Dhamma and Vinaya. If a
complete congregation performs an act (&c., down to:) the upasampadâ
ordination,--in such case, Upâli, this act is performed lawfully
according to Dhamma and Vinaya, and in such case this Sa*m*gha does not
trespass against the law.'

5\. 'Lord, if a complete congregation grants to a Bhikkhu to whom
sativinaya ought to be granted, an amû*lh*avinaya, and to a Bhikkhu to
whom amû*lh*avinaya ought to be granted, a sativinaya (&c. <span
id="fr_535"></span>[1](#fn_526), down to:.md) confers on a Bhikkhu to whom
abbhâna. ought to be granted, the upasampadâ ordination, and grants to a
person on whom the upasampadâ ordination ought to be conferred, the
decree of abbhâna,--is this act, Lord, performed lawfully according to
Dhamma and Vinaya?'

6\. 'It is performed, Upâli, unlawfully against Dhamma and Vinaya. If a
complete congregation grants to a Bhikkhu, &c.,--in such case, Upâli,
this act is performed unlawfully against Dhamma and

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vinaya, and in
such case this Sa*m*gha trespasses against the law.'

7\. 'Lord, if a complete congregation grants sativinaya to a Bhikkhu to
whom sativinaya ought to be granted, and amû*lh*avinaya to a Bhikkhu to
whom amû*lh*avinaya ought to be granted (&c. <span
id="fr_536"></span>[1](#fn_527), down to:.md) grants abbhâna to a Bhikkhu
to whom abbhâna ought to be granted, and confers the upasampadâ
ordination on a person on whom the upasampadâ ordination ought to be
conferred,--is this act, Lord, performed lawfully according to Dhamma
and Vinaya?'

8\. 'It is performed, Upâli, lawfully according to Dhamma and Vinaya
(&c., down to:) and in such case this Sa*m*gha does not trespass against
the law.'

9\. And the Blessed One thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'If a complete
congregation, O Bhikkhus, grants to a Bhikkhu to whom sativinaya ought
to be granted, an amû*lh*avinaya, in such case, O Bhikkhus, this act is
performed unlawfully against Dhamma and Vinaya, and in such case this
Sa*m*gha trespasses against the law. If a complete congregation, O
Bhikkhus, institutes against a Bhikkhu to whom sativinaya ought to be
granted, the tassapâpiyyasikâkamma (&c. <span
id="fr_537"></span>[2](#fn_528), down to:.md) grants to a person on whom
the

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

upasampadâ ordination ought to be conferred, the decree of abbhâna,--in
such case, O Bhikkhus, this act is performed unlawfully against Dhamma
and Vinaya, and in such case this Sa*m*gha trespasses against the law.'

End of the second Bhâ*n*avâra, which contains the questions of Upâli.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_520"></span>[276:1](sbe17104.htm#fr_529.md) That the redactors
of this Pi*t*aka have chosen Upâli here and at X, 6, *K*ullavagga II, 2,
7, to question the Blessed One about the Vinaya regulations, stands
evidently in connection with the tradition ascribing to Upâli an
especial authority regarding the rules of the Order and styling him, as
is said in the Dîpava*m*sa (IV, 3, 5; V, 7,. 9), agganikkhittaka, i.e.
original depositary, of the Vinaya tradition. See our Introduction, p.
xii seq.

<span id="fn_521"></span>[276:2](sbe17104.htm#fr_530.md) See *K*ullavagga
IV, 4, 10.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[276:3](sbe17104.htm#fr_531.md) See *K*ullavagga
IV, 5.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[276:4](sbe17104.htm#fr_532.md) See *K*ullavagga
IV, 11.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[277:1](sbe17104.htm#fr_533.md) This Sa*m*ghakamma
and the following ones are explained in *K*ullavagga I, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_525"></span>[277:2](sbe17104.htm#fr_534.md) For this term and
the next ones, see *K*ullavagga III, 1-9.

<span id="fn_526"></span>[278:1](sbe17104.htm#fr_535.md) The Sa*m*ghakammas
enumerated in § 2, beginning with sativinaya, are arranged here in
pairs, in direct and reverse order, in this way: sativinaya and
amû*lh*avinaya, amû*lh*avinaya and sativinaya; then amû*lh*avinaya and
tassapâpiyyasikâkamma, tassapâpiyyasikâkamma and amû*lh*avinaya, &c.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[279:1](sbe17104.htm#fr_536.md) The same dyads as
in § 5.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[279:2](sbe17104.htm#fr_537.md) In this paragraph
all possible combinations of two different Sa*m*ghakammas are formed in
this way: first, sativinaya is combined with amû*lh*avinaya and all the
rest, down to upasampadâ; then amû*lh*avinaya with all terms from
tassapâpiyyasikâ down to sativinaya, and so on; the whole series ends
thus with the combinations of upasampadâraha with all terms from
sativinaya down to abbhâna.
