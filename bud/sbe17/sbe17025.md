### 11.

1\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had disease of the eyes. They
used to carry that Bhikkhu out to ease himself. The Blessed One as he
was passing through the Bhikkhus' sleeping quarters saw them \[doing
so\]. When he saw them, he went up to the place where they were, and
asked those Bhikkhus:

'What is the disease, O Bhikkhus, from which this Bhikkhu suffers?'

2\. 'This venerable one, Lord, has disease of the eyes. Therefore do we
carry him out to ease himself.'

Then the Blessed One, on that account, having delivered a religious
discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of eye ointments <span
id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_117.md); to wit, black collyrium <span
id="fr_120"></span>[2](#fn_118.md), rasa ointment <span
id="fr_121"></span>[3](#fn_119.md), sota ointment <span
id="fr_122"></span>[4](#fn_120.md), geruka <span
id="fr_123"></span>[5](#fn_121.md), and kapalla <span
id="fr_124"></span>[6](#fn_122.md).'

They had need of perfumes to grind up into ointments.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of sandal wood, tagara <span
id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_123.md), black anusâri <span
id="fr_126"></span>[2](#fn_124.md), kâlîya <span
