yellow colour <span id="fr_480"></span>[1](#fn_472.md); they wore robes
with skirts to them which were not made of torn pieces of cloth, or were
long, or had flowers on them, or cobras' hoods on them; they wore
jackets, and dresses of the Tirî*t*aka plant <span

The people were indignant, murmured, and became annoyed, saying, 'This
is like those still living in the enjoyments of the world.'

They told the matter to the Blessed One.

'Robes that are all of a blue colour \[&c.; all the things mentioned in
the first paragraph being here repeated\] are not to be worn. Whosoever
wears them shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_472"></span>[248:1](sbe17096.htm#fr_480.md) See Buddhaghosa's
explanations of all these colours in the note on V, 2, I.

<span id="fn_473"></span>[248:2](sbe17096.htm#fr_481.md) Buddhaghosa says
on this word, Tirîtan (sic) ti pana rukkha*kh*allimaya*m*, ta*m*
pâda-pun*kh*ana*m* kâtu*m* va*tt*ati. *Kh*alli is 'bark.'

<span id="fn_474"></span>[248:3](sbe17096.htm#fr_482.md) Buddhaghosa says
that the robes of the colours mentioned in this chapter may be worn if
they have first been dyed, or may be used as coverlets, or may be cut up
and used as parts of robes. So the robes with skirts to them may be worn
if the forbidden skirts have first been torn or cut off.
