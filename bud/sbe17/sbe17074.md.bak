At that time the Bhikkhus appointed to lay the robes by, laid the robes
by in an open hall, or at the foot of a tree, or in the hollow of a
Nimba tree <span id="fr_356"></span>[1](#fn_351.md); thus they were eaten
by rats and white ants.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you appoint what the Sa*m*gha chooses, a
Vihâra, or an A*ddh*ayoga <span id="fr_357"></span>[2](#fn_352.md), or a
storied building, or an attic, or a cave, to be the store-room <span
id="fr_358"></span>[3](#fn_353) (of the Sa*m*gha.md).

'And you ought, O Bhikkhus, to appoint it in this way: Let a learned,
competent Bhikkhu proclaim the following *ñ*atti before the Sa*m*gha:
"Let the Sa*m*gha, reverend Sirs, hear me. If the Sa*m*gha is ready, let
the Sa*m*gha appoint the Vihâra called N. N, to be the store-room (of
the Sa*m*gha), (&c., the usual formula of a *ñ*aattidutiya kamma)."'

<span id="fn_352"></span>[201:2](sbe17074.htm#fr_357.md) Compare I, 30, 4.

<span id="fn_353"></span>[201:3](sbe17074.htm#fr_358.md) The word
bha*nd*âgâra does not imply any special reference to robes more than to
any other articles belonging to the Sa*m*gha. A good many things which
were usually kept in the bha*nd*âgâra are mentioned at *K*ullav. VI, 21,
3.
