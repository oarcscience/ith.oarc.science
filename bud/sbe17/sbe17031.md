### 17.

1\. Now the Blessed One journeying on in due course came to Râ*g*agaha.
And there at Râ*g*agaha the Blessed One stayed at the Veluvana in the
Kalandaka-nivâpa.

Now at that time the Blessed One was troubled with wind in his stomach.
And the venerable Ânanda thinking, 'Now formerly the Blessed One when
suffering from wind in the stomach had ease from Teka*t*ula <span
id="fr_169"></span>[2](#fn_167.md) gruel,' made ready of his own accord
tila seeds, and rice, and beans; and kept

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

them indoors; and cooked them indoors of his own accord, and offered
them to the Blessed One, saying, 'Let the Blessed One drink this
Teka*t*ula gruel.'

2\. Now the Tathâgatas sometimes ask about what they know (&c., as
usual, as, for instance, in I, 31, 5, down to the end).

And the Blessed One said to the venerable Ânanda, 'Whence, Ânanda, is
this gruel?'

Then the venerable Ânanda told this thing to the Blessed One.

3\. The Blessed Buddha rebuked him, saying, 'This is improper, Ânanda,
unbecoming, unsuitable, unworthy of Sama*n*as, not allowable, and ought
to be avoided. How can you, Ânanda, think (of permitting yourself) such
abundance? Whatever, Ânanda, is kept indoors, is not allowed; whatever
is cooked indoors, is not allowed; and whatever is cooked of your own
accord, is not allowed. This will not redound, Ânanda, to the conversion
of the unconverted.'

And when he had rebuked him, and delivered a religious discourse. he
said to the Bhikkhus: Whatsoever is kept indoors, O Bhikkhus, or cooked
indoors, or cooked of your own accord, is not to be eaten. Whosoever
shall eat thereof, is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence.

4\. 'And if, O Bhikkhus, there be food kept indoors, or cooked indoors,
or cooked of your own accord, and one shall eat thereof, he is guilty of
three dukka*t*a offences. If, O Bhikkhus, food kept indoors, and cooked
indoors, shall have been so cooked by others, and one eat thereof, he is
guilty of two dukka*t*a offences. If, O Bhikkhus, food kept indoors,
shall have been cooked out of doors, and

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

so cooked of your own accord, and one eat thereof, he is guilty of two
dukka*t*a offences.

5\. 'If, O Bhikkhus, food kept out of doors shall have been cooked
indoors, and of your own accord, and one eat thereof he is guilty of two
dukka*t*a offences. If, O Bhikkhus, food kept indoors, shall have been
cooked out of doors, and by others, and one eat thereof, he is guilty of
a dukka*t*a offence. If, O Bhikkhus, food kept out of doors shall have
been cooked indoors, and by others, and one eat thereof, he is guilty of
a dukka*t*a offence. If, O Bhikkhus, food kept out of doors, shall have
been cooked out of doors, and of your own accord, and one shall eat
thereof, he is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence. If, O Bhikkhus, food kept
out of doors, shall have been cooked out of doors, and by others, and
one shall eat thereof, he is not guilty.'

6\. Now at that time, the Bhikkhus, thinking, 'Food cooked of one's own
accord has been disallowed by the Blessed One,' feared to offend by
cooking a second time food (already cooked once).

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to cook food a second time.'

7\. Now at that time there was a scarcity of food in Râ*g*agaha. People
brought salt, and oil, and rice, and hard food to the Ârâma. These the
Bhikkhus kept out of doors; and vermin <span
id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_168.md) ate them, and thieves carried them off.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to keep food indoors.'

When they kept it indoors, and cooked it out of doors, those men who
practised self-mortification by living on the remains of offered
food <span id="fr_171"></span>[1](#fn_169.md) crowded round them; and the
Bhikkhus ate in fear.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to cook indoors.'

In the time of scarcity, those who (by offering food, inviting Bhikkhus
to their houses, &c.) made (the accepting or eating of food) allowable
(to the Bhikkhus), used to take more (for themselves), and give less to
the Bhikkhus.

I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to cook of your own accord. I allow you, O
Bhikkhus, to cook indoors, and of your own accord, food kept indoors.'

8\. Now at that time a number of Bhikkhus who had spent the rainy season
in the land of Kâsi, and were journeying to Râ*g*agaha to visit the
Blessed One, did not receive on the way as full a supply as they
required of food, either bitter or sweet. And there was plenty of
eatable fruit, but there was no one to make it allowable for them <span
id="fr_172"></span>[2](#fn_170.md). And those Bhikkhus went on in weariness
to Râ*g*agaha, to the Veluvana, in the Kalandaka-nivâpa, where the
Blessed One was. And when they had come there, they bowed down before
the Blessed One, and took their seats on one side.

Now it is the custom of the Blessed Buddhas to exchange courteous
greetings with Bhikkhus who

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

arrive. And the Blessed One said to those Bhikkhus:

'Do things go well with you, O Bhikkhus? Do you get enough to support
yourselves with? Have you accomplished your journey without too much
fatigue? And whence, O Bhikkhus, have you come?'

9\. 'Things go well with us, Lord. We have spent the rainy season in the
land of Kâsi; and as we were journeying to Râ*g*agaha to visit the
Blessed One, we did not receive on the way as full a supply as we
required of food, either bitter or sweet. And there was plenty of
eatable fruit, but there was no one to make it allowable for us. And we
came on our way in weariness.'

Then the Blessed One, in that connection, after having delivered a
religious discourse, said to the Bhikkhus: 'I allow you, O Bhikkhus,
wherever edible fruit is seen and there is no one to make it allowable,
to pick it of your own accord, and take it away. And when you see one
who can make it allowable, you are to place it on the ground, and (only)
eat it after you have received it again. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to
take whatever (fruit) you have picked up <span
id="fr_173"></span>[1](#fn_171.md).'

containing the three pungent (ka*t*u) substances, which are explained to
be ginger and two kinds of pepper.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[70:1](sbe17031.htm#fr_170.md) Buddhaghosa says,

expression recurs in VI, 33, 5.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[71:1](sbe17031.htm#fr_171.md) Buddhaghosa says,
damakâ ti vighâsâdâ. The sane explanation is given in
Abhidhânappadîpikâ, verse 467, where the Sinhalese expression is indul
kannâ, and the English 'one who eats orts.'
