<p>1. Now at that time the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a had a mountain cave at R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha cleared out, with the object of making it into a cave dwelling-place. And the M&acirc;gadha king Se<I>n</I>iya Bimbis&acirc;ra went to the place where the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a was; and when he had come there, he saluted the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a, and took his seat on one side.</p>  
<p>And when he was so seated the M&acirc;gadha king Se<I>n</I>iya Bimbis&acirc;ra said to the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a, 'What is it that my Lord, the Thera, is having done?'</p>  
<p>'I am having a cave cleared out, with the object of making it into a cave dwelling-place.'</p>  
<p>'Do you then, Sir, require an &acirc;r&acirc;mika (a park-keeper)?'</p>  
<p>'Not so, great king! A park-keeper has not been prescribed by the Blessed One.'</p>  
<p>'Then, Sir, enquire, of the Blessed One (concerning this matter), and let me then know.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_62"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 62</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'Very well, O King!' said the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a in assent to the M&acirc;gadha king Se<I>n</I>iya Bimbis&acirc;ra.</p>  
<p>2. Then the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a taught and incited and roused and gladdened the M&acirc;gadha king Se<I>n</I>iya Bimbis&acirc;ra with religious discourse. And the M&acirc;gadha king Se<I>n</I>iya Bimbis&acirc;ra, when he had been taught &amp;c. by the religious discourse, rose from his seat, and bowed down before the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a, and passing round him with his right side towards him, departed thence.</p>  
<p>Then the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a sent a message to the Blessed One, saying, 'Lord! the M&acirc;gadha king Se<I>n</I>iya Bimbis&acirc;ra desires to present me with a park-keeper. What am I, therefore, Lord, to do?'</p>  
<p>Then the Blessed One, in that connection, after delivering a religious discourse, said to the Bhikkhus:</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the accepting of a park-keeper.'</p>  
<p>3. And a second time the M&acirc;gadha king Se<I>n</I>iya Bimbis&acirc;ra went to the place where the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a was; and when he had come there he saluted the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a, and took his seat on one side.</p>  
<p>And when he was so seated the M&acirc;gadha king Se<I>n</I>iya Bimbis&acirc;ra said to the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a, 'Has the Blessed One allowed a park-keeper?'</p>  
<p>'Yes, O King!'</p>  
<p>Then, Sir, I will present a park-keeper to you.'</p>  
<p>Now the M&acirc;gadha king Se<I>n</I>iya Bimbis&acirc;ra, after he had (thus) promised a park-keeper to the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a, forgot it. And after a time he</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_63"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 63</FONT></A></p>  
<p>recovered recollection of it, and addressed a certain minister who had charge of general affairs, and said: 'The park-keeper whom I promised to the venerable one, has he been given to him?'</p>  
<p>'No, your Majesty!'</p>  
<p>'How long is it then, good Sir, since that was determined?'</p>  
<p>4. Then that minister, counting up the nights, said to the M&acirc;gadha king Se<I>n</I>iya Bimbis&acirc;ra, 'Five hundred nights, your Majesty.'</p>  
<p>'Give then, my good Sir, five hundred park-keepers to the venerable one!'</p>  
<p>'As your Majesty commands,' said that minister in assent to the M&acirc;gadha king Se<I>n</I>iya Bimbis&acirc;ra; and he gave over to the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a five hundred park-keepers, and (for their use) a distinct village grew up. And they called it Ar&acirc;mika-g&acirc;ma, and they called it also Pilinda-g&acirc;ma. Thenceforward the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a depended upon the families living in that village (for alms, &amp;c.). And the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a robed himself early in the morning, and entered into Pilinda-g&acirc;ma, duly bowled and robed for alms.</p>  
<p>5. Now at that time there was a feast in that village, and the children were celebrating it, with their ornaments on, and decked with garlands. And the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a, when he was going his rounds for alms, straight on from house to house, came to the dwelling-place of a certain park-keeper; and when he had come there he sat down on a seat prepared for him.</p>  
<p>And at that time the daughter of that park-keeper's wife, seeing the other children with their ornaments on, and decked with garlands, began to</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_64"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 64</FONT></A></p>  
<p>cry (saying), 'Give me too a garland, give me an ornament!'</p>  
<p>And the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a said to that park-keeper's wife: 'Why does that girl cry?'</p>  
<p>'This girl, venerable Sir, seeing the other children with their ornaments on, and decked with garlands, is crying (and saying), "Give me too a garland, give me too an ornament!" But whence should we, who have become so poor, get garlands or ornaments?'</p>  
<p>6. Then the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a took a grass chumbat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and said to the park-keeper's wife: 'Bind, I pray you, this grass chumbat round the child's head.'</p>  
<p>And the park-keeper's wife took the grass chumbat, and bound it round the girl's head. And that became a chaplet of gold, beautiful, lovely, and pleasing, such that there was no chaplet of gold in the king's seraglio like it.</p>  
<p>And people told the M&acirc;gadha king Se<I>n</I>iya Bimbis&acirc;ra, 'There is a chaplet of gold, your Majesty, in the house of such and such a park-keeper, such that there is no chaplet of gold in the king's seraglio like it. How could he, poor as he is, have got (such a thing)? For a certainty he must have procured it by theft.'</p>  
<p>Then the M&acirc;gadha king Se<I>n</I>iya Bimbis&acirc;ra had (the whole of) that park-keeper's family thrown into bonds.</p>  
<p>7. Now the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a robed himself again early in the morning, and went, duly bowled and robed, into Pilinda-g&acirc;ma for alms. And going his round for alms straight on from house to house he came to the dwelling-place of that park-keeper; and</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_65"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 65</FONT></A></p>  
<p>when he had come there he asked the neighbours, 'Where is the family of this park-keeper gone to?'</p>  
<p>'The king, Sir, has had them thrown into bonds on account of that chaplet of gold.'</p>  
<p>Then the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a went on to the residence of the M&acirc;gadha king Se<I>n</I>iya Bimbis&acirc;ra: and when he had come there he sat down on the seat prepared for him. And the M&acirc;gadha king Se<I>n</I>iya Bimbis&acirc;ra went to the place where the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a was; and when he had come there, he bowed down before the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a, and took his seat on one side. And when he was so seated the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a said to the M&acirc;gadha king Se<I>n</I>iya Bimbis&acirc;ra:</p>  
<p>8. 'Why, O King, has the park-keeper's family been thrown into bonds?'</p>  
<p>'That park-keeper, Sir, has in his house a chaplet of gold, such that there is no chaplet of gold in the king's seraglio like it. Whence should he, poor as he is, have got (such a thing)? For a certainty he has procured it by theft.'</p>  
<p>Then the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a determined that the palace of the M&acirc;gadha king Se<I>n</I>iya Bimbis&acirc;ra should be gold. And it became all of gold.</p>  
<p>'Now, your Majesty, whence have you this so great quantity of gold?'</p>  
<p>'I understand, Lord. This is your miraculous power' (said the king. And so saying) he set that park-keeper's family free.</p>  
<p>9. When the people, glad at heart and full of satisfaction, saw that so great a miracle had been shown by the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a to the king and his royal retinue, they brought to the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a the five kinds of medicine,--that is to</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_66"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 66</FONT></A></p>  
<p>say, ghee, butter, oil, honey, and molasses. Now (besides this) the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a was accustomed to receive the five kinds of medicine; and whatever he received he distributed among his attendant (Bhikkhus). So the retinue became abounding therein, and as they received it they laid it aside, filling vessels and pots; and filling water-strainers and bags with it they laid them in the windows, and they remained there clinging and adhering together, and the Vih&acirc;ras became sprinkled and scattered all over with them through the (gnawing of) rats. People who saw this, when they went round the Vih&acirc;ras, were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant (saying), 'These Sakyaputtiya Sama<I>n</I>as are becoming storers up of goods like the M&acirc;gadha king Se<I>n</I>iya Bimbis&acirc;ra.'</p>  
<p>To. The Bhikkhus heard the people thus murmuring, &amp;c. And those Bhikkhus who were moderate were indignant, &amp;c., saying,</p>  
<p>'How can Bhikkhus think (of possessing) such abundance?'</p>  
<p>And those Bhikkhus told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'Is it true, Bhikkhus, as they say, that Bhikkhus think (of possessing) such abundance?'</p>  
<p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
<p>The Blessed One rebuked them, and after delivering a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus:</p>  
<p>'Whatsoever kinds of medicine are meet for the use of sick Bhikkhus,--that is to say, ghee, butter, oil, honey, and molasses,--when such are received they must be used within a period of seven days during which they may be stored up. Whosoever</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_67"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 67</FONT></A></p>  
<p>goes beyond that limit shall be dealt with according to law&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="sbe17030.htm#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>
