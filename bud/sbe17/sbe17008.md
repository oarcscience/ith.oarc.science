### 7.

1\. Now when the Blessed One had remained at Râ*g*agaha as long as he
thought fit, he set out on his journey towards Benares. And wandering
from place to place, he came to Benares, and there at Benares the
Blessed One stayed in the deer-park Isipatana.

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus, since the Blessed One had
forbidden wooden shoes, used to break off young palmyra palms, and wear
shoes made of the talipat leaves <span id="fr_44"></span>[2](#fn_43).
The young palmyra plants withered. People were annoyed, murmured, and
became angry, saying, 'How can

the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as break off young palmyra palms, and wear shoes
made of the talipat leaves? The young palmyra plants wither. (By so
doing), the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as destroy vegetable life.'

2\. The Bhikkhus heard those people murmuring in annoyance and
indignation; and they told this matter to the Blessed One.

'Is it true' (&c., as in chap. 4. 2)?

'It is true, Lord.'

The Blessed Buddha rebuked them, saying, 'How can those foolish persons,
O Bhikkhus, \[act thus\]? For people believe, O Bhikkhus, that life
dwells in a tree. Such conduct will not conduce (&c., as in chap. 4. 2,
down to:) becoming estranged.

Foot coverings made of talipat leaves, O Bhikkhus, are not to be worn.
Whosoever wears them, is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence.'

3\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus, since the Blessed One
had forbidden talipat shoes, used to break off young bambus, and wear
shoes made of the bambu leaves (&c., as in last section down to the end,
substituting bambu for palmyra).
