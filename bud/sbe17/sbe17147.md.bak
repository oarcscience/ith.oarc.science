1\. Now the venerable Upâli went up to the place where the Blessed One
was; and on arriving there, he saluted the Blessed One, and took his
seat on one side. And when he was so seated the venerable Upâli said to
the Blessed One: 'Now in what case, Lord, can there be an interruption
of the probationary period of a Bhikkhu who has been placed on
probation <span id="fr_716"></span>[2](#fn_698.md)?'

There are three ways of interruption of the probationary period, O
Upâli, of a Bhikkhu who has been placed on probation; (that is to say),
by

dwelling together <span id="fr_717"></span>[1](#fn_699.md), by dwelling
alone <span id="fr_718"></span>[2](#fn_700.md), and by not announcing <span
id="fr_719"></span>[3](#fn_701.md).

'These are the three ways of interruption to the probationary period, O
Upâli, of a Bhikkhu who has been placed under probation.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_698"></span>[391:2](sbe17147.htm#fr_716.md) Literally,
'breaking of the nights.' The time of probation was reckoned, not by
days, but by nights; and in either of the three cases which follow the
reckoning was interrupted, and had to begin afresh.

<span id="fn_699"></span>[392:1](sbe17147.htm#fr_717.md) Buddhaghosa
explains this to mean when the probationer has done any of the things
forbidden in II, 1, 4.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[392:2](sbe17147.htm#fr_718.md) That is, when the
probationer has done any of the things forbidden in II, 1, 3.

<span id="fn_701"></span>[392:3](sbe17147.htm#fr_719.md) That is, when the
probationer has omitted to make any of the announcements prescribed at
the end of II, 1, 2.
