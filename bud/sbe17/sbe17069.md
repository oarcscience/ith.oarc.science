### 2.

At that time the king of Kâsi <span id="fr_351"></span>[2](#fn_346.md) sent
to *G*îvaka Komârabha*kk*a a woollen garment made half of Benares cloth
. . .  <span id="fr_352"></span>[3](#fn_347.md). Then *G*îvaka
Komârabha*kk*a

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

took that woollen garment made half of Benares cloth and went to the
place where the Blessed One was; having approached him, and respectfully
saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him. Sitting near him,
*G*îvaka Komârabha*kk*a said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, this woollen
garment made half of Benares cloth. . . . <span
id="fr_353"></span>[1](#fn_348.md) has been sent to me by the king of Kâsi.
May the Blessed One, Lord, accept this woollen garment, which may be to
me a long time for a good and a blessing.' The Blessed One accepted that
woollen garment.

And the Blessed One taught (&c., as in chap. I, 34, down to:) and went
away.

And the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse in
consequence of that, thus addressed the Bhikkhus:

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to use woollen garments.'

<span id="fn_346"></span>[195:2](sbe17069.htm#fr_351.md) Buddhaghosa: 'This
king was Pasenadi's brother, the same father's son.' He appears to have
been a sub-king of Pasenadi, for in the Lohi*kk*a-sutta it is stated
that Pasenadi's rule extended both over Kâsi and Kosala ('Râ*g*â
Pasenadi Kosalo Kâsikosala*m* a*ggh*âvasati').

<span id="fn_347"></span>[195:3](sbe17069.htm#fr_352.md) Our translation of
a*ddh*akâsika*m* kambala*m* is merely <span id="page_196">p. 196</span>
conjectural. Buddhaghosa has the following note: 'A*ddh*akâsiya*m*, here
kâsi means one thousand; a thing that is worth one thousand, is called
kâsiya. This garment was worth five hundred; therefore it is called
a*ddh*akâsiya. And for the same reason it is said, upa*ddh*akâsina*m*
khamamâna*m*.' Perhaps vikâsika*m* at VI, 15, 5 may have some connection
with the word used here.

<span id="fn_348"></span>[196:1](sbe17069.htm#fr_353.md) See last note.
