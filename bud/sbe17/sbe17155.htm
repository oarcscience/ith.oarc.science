<p>1. Now at that time the Blessed Buddha was staying at S&acirc;vatthi, in the <I>G</I>etavana, An&acirc;thapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>ika's Grove. And at that time the venerable Ud&acirc;yi committed an offence, to wit, the first Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa offence, and did not conceal it. He told the Bhikkhus, saying, 'I have committed an offence--the first Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa offence--and do not conceal it. What now shall I do?'</p>  
<p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'Then, O Bhikkhus, let the Sa<I>m</I>gha lay the M&acirc;natta penalty on Ud&acirc;yi the Bhikkhu for the space of six days on account of that offence--the first Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa--which he has not concealed.</p>  
<p>2. 'Now thus, O Bhikkhus, ought it to be laid upon him. Ud&acirc;yi the Bhikkhu ought to go up, O Bhikkhus, before the Sa<I>m</I>gha; and, arranging his robe on one shoulder, he ought to bow down at the feet of the elder Bhikkhus, and squatting down on his heels, and stretching forth his hands with the palms together, he ought to say as follows:</p>  
<p>'"I, venerable Sirs, have committed an offence--the first Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa--which I have not concealed. I ask the Sa<I>m</I>gha (to impose upon me) the M&acirc;natta penalty for six days on account of this offence--the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_398"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 398</FONT></A></p>  
<p>first Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa offence--which I have not concealed."'</p>  
<p>[This speech is repeated three times.]</p>  
<p>3. 'Some discreet and able Bhikkhu should then lay the matter before the Sa<I>m</I>gha, as follows:</p>  
<p>'"Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha hear me. Ud&acirc;yi the Bhikkhu has committed an offence--the first Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa offence--which he has not concealed. And he asks the Sa<I>m</I>gha for the M&acirc;natta penalty for six days on account of that offence-the first Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa offence--which he has not concealed.</p>  
<p>'"If the time seem meet to the Sa<I>m</I>gha, let the Sa<I>m</I>gha impose a M&acirc;natta of six days' duration on Ud&acirc;yi the Bhikkhu for that one offence--the first Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa offence--which he has not concealed.</p>  
<p>'"This is the motion (<I>&ntilde;</I>atti).</p>  
<p>'"The Sa<I>m</I>gha hereby imposes a M&acirc;natta of six days on Ud&acirc;yi the Bhikkhu for that one offence--the first Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa offence--which he has not concealed.</p>  
<p>'"Whosoever of the venerable ones approves of the imposition of a M&acirc;natta (&amp;c., as in the last paragraph, down to) not concealed, let him remain silent. Whosoever approves not, let him speak.</p>  
<p>'"A second time I say the same thing (&amp;c., as before in the last two paragraphs). A third time I say the same thing (&amp;c., as before).</p>  
<p>'"The Sa<I>m</I>gha has imposed a M&acirc;natta of six days' duration (&amp;c., as before, in the words of the motion, down to) not concealed. The Sa<I>m</I>gha approves thereof. Therefore is it silent. Thus do I understand."'</p>
