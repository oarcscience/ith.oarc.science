fit, he went on his

journey towards Sâvatthi. And in due course, journeying straight on, he
arrived at Sâvatthi, and there, at Sâvatthi, the Blessed One stayed in
the Ârama of Anâtha-pi*nd*ika.

Now at that time there was in Sâvatthi great abundance of solid food in
the shape of fruits. And the question arose among the Bhikkhus, 'Has,
now, the Blessed One permitted the use of fruits as solid food, or has
he not?'

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, all solid food in the shape of fruits.'
