### 28.

1\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu came naked up to the place where
the Blessed One was, and said:

'The Blessed One, Lord, has praised in many ways the moderate man and
the contented who has eradicated (evil), who has shaken off his
passions, who is gracious, reverent, energetic <span
id="fr_471"></span>[5](#fn_463). Now this

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

nakedness, Lord, is in many ways effectual to moderation and content, to
the eradication of evil, to the suppressions of the passions, to
graciousness, reverence, and zeal. It were well, Lord, if the Blessed
One would enjoin nakedness upon the Bhikkhus.'

The Blessed Buddha rebuked him, saying, 'This would be improper, O
foolish one, crooked, unsuitable, unworthy of a Sam a n a, unbecoming,
and it ought not to be done. How can you, O foolish one, adopt nakedness
as the Titthiyas do? This will not conduce, O foolish one, to the
conversion of the unconverted.'

And when he had rebuked him, and had delivered a religious discourse, he
addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to adopt nakedness, as the Titthiyas do <span
id="fr_472"></span>[1](#fn_464). Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a
grave offence (Thulla*kk*aya).'

2\. \[The whole -section repeated respectively in the case of a Bhikkhu
clad in a garment of grass, clad in a garment of bark <span
id="fr_473"></span>[2](#fn_465), clad in a garment of phalaka
cloth <span id="fr_474"></span>[3](#fn_466), clad in a garment of
hair <span id="fr_475"></span>[4](#fn_467), clad in the skin of a wild
animal, clad in the feathers of

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

an owl, clad in antelope skins (with the hoofs left on) <span
id="fr_476"></span>[1](#fn_468). But instead of 'adopt nakedness as the
Titthiyas do' substitute respectively 'wear a garment of grass, &c.,
which is the symbol <span id="fr_477"></span>[2](#fn_469) the Titthiyas
use.'\]

3\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu came up to the place where the
Blessed One was, clad in cloth made of the stalks of the akka
plant <span id="fr_478"></span>[3](#fn_470).

\[All as before in § 1, down to:\]

And when he had rebuked him, and had delivered a religious discourse, he
addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to dress yourselves in the stalks of the akka
plant. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

\[§ 3 is then repeated of a Bhikkhu clad in cloth made of the maka*k*i
fibre <span id="fr_479"></span>[4](#fn_471).\]

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_463"></span>[245:5](sbe17095.htm#fr_471) So, for example,
in *K*ullavagga I, 1, 3.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[246:1](sbe17095.htm#fr_472) Compare above,
VIII, 15, 7 and 11.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[246:2](sbe17095.htm#fr_473) This is several
times referred to in the *G*âtakas; for instance, pp. 6, 9, 12,

<span id="fn_466"></span>[246:3](sbe17095.htm#fr_474) Perhaps made of
leaves. Compare Böhtlingk-Roth's, No. 5, sub voce; and *G*âtaka I, 304
(phalakattharasayana). Perhaps also *G*âtaka I, 356, 'making a man his
phalaka,' may be a figure of speech founded on this use of the word, and
mean 'making him his covering.'

<span id="fn_467"></span>[246:4](sbe17095.htm#fr_475) Like the
well-known Titthiya A*g*ita, one of the six great heretics
(Sâma*ññ*a-phala Sutta, ed. Grimblot, p. 114, Book of the Great Decease,
V, 60).

<span id="fn_468"></span>[247:1](sbe17095.htm#fr_476) Buddhaghosa, at
Suttavibhaṅga, Pârâ*g*ika I, 10, 3, where this word occurs, says on it,
A*g*inakkhikan (sic) ti saloma*m* sakhura*m* agina-miga-*k*amma*m*.
Compare also above, Mahâvagga V. 4.

<span id="fn_469"></span>[247:2](sbe17095.htm#fr_477) Titthiya-dha*g*a.
Compare *G*âtaka I, 65, and *K*ullavagga I, 2 7.

<span id="fn_470"></span>[247:3](sbe17095.htm#fr_478) Akkanâ*l*an ti
akkanâ*l*amaya*m* (B.). Compare Böhtlingk-Roth, under arka.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[247:4](sbe17095.htm#fr_479) Potthako ti
maka*k*imayo vu*kk*ati (B.). So also Childers, sub voce.
