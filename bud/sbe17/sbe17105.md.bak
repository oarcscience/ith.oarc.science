### 7.

1\. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu be litigious, contentious,
quarrelsome, disputatious, and constantly raise questions before the
Sa*m*gha, And the other Bhikkhus say among each other: "This Bhikkhu,
friends, is indeed litigious, contentious, &c.; well, let us proceed
against him with the ta*gg*aniyakamma <span
id="fr_538"></span>[1](#fn_529.md)." And they proceed against him with the
ta*gg*aniyakamma unlawfully <span id="fr_539"></span>[2](#fn_530.md) with
an incomplete congregation <span id="fr_540"></span>[3](#fn_531.md), and he
then goes from that district to another district. There the Bhikkhus say
among each other: "Against this Bhikkhu, friends, the Sa*m*gha has
proceeded with the ta*gg*aniyakamma unlawfully with an incomplete
congregation; well, let us proceed against him with the
ta*gg*aniyakamma." And they proceed against him with the
ta*gg*aniyakamma unlawfully with a complete congregation, and he then
goes from that district again to- another district. And there the
Bhikkhus again say among each other (&c.,

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

down to:) and they proceed against him with the ta*gg*aniyakamma
lawfully with an incomplete congregation . . . . seemingly
lawfully <span id="fr_541"></span>[1](#fn_532.md) with an congregation . .
. . seemingly lawfully with a complete congregation <span
id="fr_542"></span>[2](#fn_533.md).

2-5. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu be litigious, &c. <span
id="fr_543"></span>[3](#fn_534.md)

6\. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu be ignorant, unlearned, a constant
offender, unable to discern what is an offence <span
id="fr_544"></span>[4](#fn_535.md), and lives in lay society, unduly
associating himself with lay people. And the other Bhikkhus say among
each other: "This Bhikkhu, friends, is indeed ignorant, unlearned, &c.;
well, let us proceed against him with the nissayakamma <span
id="fr_545"></span>[5](#fn_536.md)," and they proceed against him with the
nissayakamma unlawfully with an incomplete congregation, &c. <span
id="fr_546"></span>[6](#fn_537.md)

7\. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu leads a life hurtful to the laity,
and devoted to evil <span id="fr_547"></span>[7](#fn_538.md). And the other
Bhikkhus say among each other: "This

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bhikkhu, friends,
leads a life hurtful to the laity, and devoted to evil; well, let us
proceed against him with the pabbâ*g*aniyakamma <span
id="fr_548"></span>[1](#fn_539.md)," &c. <span
id="fr_549"></span>[2](#fn_540.md)

8\. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu abuses and reviles lay people. And
the other Bhikkhus say among each other: "This Bhikkhu, friends, abuses
and reviles lay people; well, let us proceed against him with the
pa*t*isâra*n*iyakamma <span id="fr_550"></span>[3](#fn_541.md)," &c.2

9-11. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu, having committed an offence,
refuses to see that offence (committed by himself) <span
id="fr_551"></span>[4](#fn_542.md). And the other Bhikkhus say among each
other: "This Bhikkhu, friends, has committed an offence and refuses to
see that offence; well, let us pronounce expulsion against him for his
refusal to see that offence <span id="fr_552"></span>[5](#fn_543.md),"
&c. <span id="fr_553"></span>[2](#fn_540.md)

12-13. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu, against whom the Sa*m*gha has
proceeded with the ta*gg*aniyakamma, behaves himself properly, lives
modestly, aspires to get clear of his penance, and asks for the
revocation of the ta*gg*aniyakamma sentence. And the other Bhikkhus say
among each other: "This Bhikkhu, friends, against whom the Sa*m*gha has
proceeded with the ta*gg*aniyakamma, in truth behaves himself properly;
he lives modestly, &c.; well, let us revoke the ta*gg*aniyakamma
sentence pronounced against him." And they revoke the ta*gg*aniyakamma
sentence

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

pronounced against him unlawfully with an incomplete congregation. And
he then goes from that district to another district. There the Bhikkhus
say among each other: "The ta*gg*aniyakamma sentence, friends,
pronounced against this Bhikkhu has been revoked by the Sa*m*gha
unlawfully with an incomplete congregation," &c. <span
id="fr_554"></span>[1](#fn_544.md)

14\. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu against whom the Sa*m*gha has
proceeded with the nissayakamma . . . . with the pabbâ*g*aniyakamma . .
. . with the pa*t*isâra*n*iyakamma . . . . against whom the Sa*m*gha has
pronounced expulsion for his refusal to see an offence . . . . for his
refusal to atone for an offence . . . . for his refusal to renounce a
false doctrine, behaves himself properly, &c. <span
id="fr_555"></span>[2](#fn_545.md)

15\. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu be litigious, contentious,
quarrelsome, disputatious, and constantly raise questions before the
Sa*m*gha. And the other Bhikkhus say among each other: "This Bhikkhu,
friends, is indeed litigious, contentious, &c.; well, let us proceed
against him with the ta*gg*aniyakamma." And they proceed against him
with the ta*gg*aniyakamma, unlawfully with an incomplete congregation.
Now among the Sa*m*gha residing in that district a contention is raised
whether this is an act performed unlawfully with an incomplete
congregation, or an act performed unlawfully with a complete
congregation, or an act performed lawfully with an incomplete

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

congregation, or an act performed seemingly law-fully with an incomplete
congregation, or an act performed seemingly lawfully with a complete
congregation, or an act not performed, badly performed, to be performed
again. In this case, O Bhikkhus, the Bhikkhus who say: "It is an act
performed unlawfully with an incomplete congregation"--and the Bhikkhus
who say: "It is an act not performed, badly performed, to be performed
again"--these Bhikkhus are right herein.

16\. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu be litigious (&c., as in § 15, down
to:) and they proceed against him with the ta*gg*aniyakamma unlawfully
with a complete congregation . . . . lawfully with an incomplete
congregation . . . . seemingly lawfully with an incomplete congregation
. . . . seemingly lawfully with a complete congregation. Now among the
Sa*m*gha residing in that district (&c., as in § 15).

17-20. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu be ignorant, unlearned,'

with a different arrangement of the five categories on which this
exposition is based: unlawfully with an incomplete congregation,
unlawfully with a complete congregation, lawfully with an incomplete
congregation, seemingly lawfully with an incomplete congregation,
seemingly lawfully with a complete congregation. In § 1 these categories
are arranged in their natural order; in § 2 the second is placed at the
head, then follow the third, fourth, fifth, and finally the first; in §
3 the exposition likewise begins with the third and ends with the
second, &c. This arrangement is called 'a wheel' (*k*akka).

Sa*m*ghakammas down to the expulsion for a Bhikkhu's refusal to renounce
a false doctrine (see §§ 7-11) in the same manner as the
ta*gg*aniyakamma is spoken of in §§ 15, 16. Then follows (§§ 19, 20) an
exactly analogous exposition about the revocation of these
Sa*m*ghakammas, which stands in the same relation to §§ 15-18 in which
§§ 12-14 stand to §§ 1-11.
