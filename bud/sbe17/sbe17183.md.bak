1\. \[The whole of the last chapter is 'repeated in the case of a
Bhikkhu who, having committed offences, becomes a Sâma*n*era, goes out
of his mind, or becomes weak in his mind <span
id="fr_757"></span>[1](#fn_735.md), and the text then goes on\] 'He becomes
diseased in his sensations. His offences are some of them concealed,
some not concealed. Of some offences he is aware, of some he is not
aware. Some offences he recollects, some he does not recollect. Of some
offences he is certain, of some he is not certain. Those offences of
which he was not certain, those he conceals; those offences of which he
was certain, those he does not conceal. Then he becomes diseased in his
sensations. When he has recovered power over his sensations, those
offences of which he previously had been certain and had concealed, of
those he is afterwards still certain, but does not conceal them; and
those offences of which he previously had been

uncertain and had not concealed, of those he became certain but did not
conceal them. Those offences of which he previously had been certain and
had concealed, of those he was afterwards still certain and did not
conceal while those offences of which he previously had been uncertain,
and had not concealed, of those offences he afterwards became certain
and did conceal them. Those offences of which previously he had been
certain, and had concealed, of those offences he was afterwards still
certain and did conceal them; while those offences of which he
previously had been uncertain and had not concealed, of those offences
he afterwards became certain, and did not conceal them. Those offences
of which he previously had been certain, and had concealed them, of
those offences he was afterwards still certain and did conceal them;
whilst those offences of which he previously had been uncertain and did
not conceal them, of those offences he afterwards became certain and did
conceal them,--on that Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, \[the same penalty is to be
imposed. as in chapter 29, section 1, paragraph 4.\]'

Here end the hundred cases <span id="fr_758"></span>[1](#fn_736.md) in
which a Mânatta (is to be imposed after a change of state in the guilty
Bhikkhu).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_735"></span>[426:1](sbe17183.htm#fr_757.md) See above, chap.
27, and Mahâvagga II, 22, 3; IX, 4, 7.

<span id="fn_736"></span>[427:1](sbe17183.htm#fr_758.md) The hundred cases
are made up thus: Chap. 29, §§ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 contain each of them four
cases (after our correction of 29. 2); so that chap. 29 gives altogether
twenty cases. Then in chap. 30, each of these twenty cases is repeated
in the four other cases there given; so that chap. 30 gives altogether
eighty cases. Of these eighty cases, as usual, at the end of a
repetition, the last (four cases) are set out in full.
