### 14.

1\. Whilst he was undergoing that probation he committed an offence--the
first Sa*m*ghâdisesa--which for five days he concealed.

He told, &c. . . . 'I committed, &c. . . . I asked, &c. . . . The
Sa*m*gha imposed a probation of half a month, &c. . . . Whilst I was
undergoing, &c. . . What now shall I do?'

They told, &c.

'Let then the Sa*m*gha, O Bhikkhus, for that whilst (&c., as in the
first paragraph) throw Udâyi the Bhikkhu back to the beginning of his
probationary

term, and impose upon him an inclusive probation (to include his new
offence together) with the former offence <span
id="fr_732"></span>[1](#fn_712.md).

'Now thus, O Bhikkhus, \[here follow two kammavâ*k*âs, one for the
throwing back, and one for the additional probation, each of them as in
chapter 1.\]'

Samodhâna-parivâsa. It is clear from the next chapter that this
probation did not affect the Mânatta to which he was liable for that
first offence. The Mânatta always lasted six days, and was preceded by a
probation equal in length to the time during which the offence had been
concealed. If now, during that probation, another offence was committed
and concealed, the penalties for this new offence and for the old one
were not accumulative but concurrent. The offender lost the advantage of
the probation he had already undergone, he was thrown back to the
commencement of his term of probation, and had to begin again. But the
new term of probation--equal in length to whichever was the longest of
the two periods during which he had concealed the two
offences--satisfied both the concealments, and the Mânatta which still,
as it would have done before, followed at the end of the probation,
satisfied both the offences. See our note below on chapter 20.
