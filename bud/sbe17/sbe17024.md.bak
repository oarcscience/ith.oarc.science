### 10.

1\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus who were sick had need of sifted <span
id="fr_118"></span>[4](#fn_116.md) chunam as medicine.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a chunam sieve.'

They had need of the chunam very fine.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a cloth sieve.'

2\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had a disease not human. Though
his teacher and his superior nursed him, they were not able to make him
well. He went to a place where swine were slaughtered, and ate the raw
flesh, and drank the blood. Thereby his sickness abated.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, in the case of a disease not human, the use of raw
flesh and of blood.'
