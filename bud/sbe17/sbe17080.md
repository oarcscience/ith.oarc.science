### 13.

1\. Now when the Blessed One had remained at Râ*g*agaha as long as he
thought fit, he went forth on his journey towards Vesâlî. And the
Blessed One, when on the high road between Râ*g*agaha and Vesâlî, saw a
number of Bhikkhus smothered up in robes <span
id="fr_382"></span>[1](#fn_377.md), they went along with robes made up into
a roll <span id="fr_383"></span>[2](#fn_378.md) on their heads, or on their
backs, or on their waist. And when the Blessed One saw them, he thought:
'With too great celerity have these foolish persons given themselves up
to superfluity <span id="fr_384"></span>[3](#fn_379.md) in the matter of
dress. It would be well were I to confine the dress of the Bhikkhus
within limits, and were to fix a bound thereto.'

2\. And the Blessed One, proceeding in due course on his journey toward
Vesâlî, arrived at that place. And there, at Vesâlî, the Blessed One
stayed at the Gotamaka shrine <span id="fr_385"></span>[4](#fn_380.md). And
at that time in the cold

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

winter nights, in the period between the Ash*t*akâ festivals when the
snow falls <span id="fr_386"></span>[1](#fn_381.md), the Blessed One sat at
night in the open air with but one robe on, and the Blessed One felt not
cold. As the first watch of the night was coming to its end, the Blessed
One felt cold; and he put on a second robe, and felt not cold. As the
middle watch of the night was coming to its end, the Blessed One felt
cold; and he put on a third robe, and felt not cold. As the last watch
of the night was coming to an end, when the dawn was breaking and the
night was far spent <span id="fr_387"></span>[2](#fn_382.md), the Blessed
One felt cold; and he put on a fourth robe, and felt not cold.

3\. Then this thought sprang up in the Blessed One's mind: 'Those men of
good birth <span id="fr_388"></span>[3](#fn_383.md) in this doctrine and
discipline who are affected by cold, and are afraid of cold, they are
able to make use of three robes <span id="fr_389"></span>[4](#fn_384.md).
It were well if in confining within limits the dress of the Bhikkhus,
and in fixing a bound thereto, I were to allow the use of three robes.'
And on that occasion the Blessed One, when he had

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

delivered a religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

4, 5. 'When on the high road, &c. . . . I saw, &c. . . .  and I thought,
&c. . . .  (all the chapter is repeated down to ". . . . I were to allow
the use of three robes"). I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of three
robes, (to wit), a double waist cloth, and a single <span
id="fr_390"></span>[1](#fn_385.md) upper robe, and a single under
garment <span id="fr_391"></span>[2](#fn_386.md).'

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

6\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus, on the ground that
three robes had been allowed by the Blessed One, used to frequent the
village in one suit of three robes, and in another suit to rest in the
Ârâma, and in another to go to the bath. Then those Bhikkhus who were
modest were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant, saying, How can the
*Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus wear extra suits of robes.'

And those Bhikkhus told the matter to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed
One on that occasion, when he had delivered a religious discourse,
addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to wear an extra suit of robes. Whosoever does
so, shall be dealt with according to law <span
id="fr_392"></span>[1](#fn_387.md):

7\. Now at that time the venerable Ânanda had acquired an extra suit of
robes, and the venerable Ânanda was desirous of giving the extra suit to
the venerable Sâriputta, but the venerable Sâriputta was staying at
Sâketa. Then the venerable Ânanda thought: 'It hath been laid down by
the Blessed One that we are not to keep an extra suit of robes. Now I
have received one, and I want to give it to the venerable Sâriputta; but
he is staying at Sâketa. What now shall I do?'

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

And the venerable Ânanda told this thing to the Blessed One.

'How long will it be, Ânanda, before the venerable Sâriputta returns?'

'He will come back, Lord, on the ninth or the tenth day from now.'

Then the Blessed One on that occasion, when he had delivered a religious
discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to keep an extra suit of robes up to the tenth
day <span id="fr_393"></span>[1](sbe17081.htm#fn_388.md).'

8\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus used to get extra suits of robes given
to them. And these Bhikkhus thought: 'What now should we do with extra
suits of robes?'

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I enjoin upon you, O Bhikkhus, to make over an extra suit of robes (to
other Bhikkhus who have no robes <span
id="fr_394"></span>[2](sbe17081.htm#fn_389).md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_377"></span>[210:1](sbe17080.htm#fr_382.md) Ubbha*nd*ite
*k*îvarehi. The former word is of course applied to the Bhikkhus.
Compare Childers, under Bha*nd*ikâ, and *G*âtaka I, 504 (last line but
one).

<span id="fn_378"></span>[210:2](sbe17080.htm#fr_383.md) Bhisî = Sanskrit
B*ri*sî. Compare the 14th Pâ*k*ittiya, where we ought to have rendered
the word 'bolster.' Childers is incorrect in translating it by 'mat'

<span id="fn_379"></span>[210:3](sbe17080.htm#fr_384.md) Mentioned also, as
being near to Vesâlî, in the 'Book of the Great Decease,' III, 2.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[210:4](sbe17080.htm#fr_385.md) Bâhullâya âvattâ.
This phrase occurs in Mahâvagga I, 31, 5.

<span id="fn_381"></span>[211:1](sbe17080.htm#fr_386.md) See our note on
the same phrase at Mahâvagga I, 20, 15.

<span id="fn_382"></span>[211:2](sbe17080.htm#fr_387.md) Nandimukhiyâ
rattiyâ. The derivation of this phrase is uncertain, though the general
meaning is not subject to doubt. The Sanskrit form of the whole phrase
will be found in the Lalita Vistara at p. 447. Comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana-g*ri*hya, ed. Oldenberg, IV, 4, where the word nândîmukho
occurs in a different connection.

<span id="fn_383"></span>[211:3](sbe17080.htm#fr_388.md) In the text read
Ye pi kho kulaputtâ. The idea is that men of lower grade, being
accustomed to cold, would not want so many robes. But there must be one
rule for all; and the rule is accordingly made to suit the comfort of
the weaker brethren--early Buddhism, contrary to an erroneous opinion
still frequently ex-pressed, being opposed to asceticism.

<span id="fn_384"></span>[211:4](sbe17080.htm#fr_389.md) Or, 'to get on
with the three robes.' Compare the use of yâpetu*m* in the 'Book of the
Great Decease,' II, 32.

<span id="fn_385"></span>[212:1](sbe17080.htm#fr_390.md) Eka*kk*iya*m*.
Compare *G*âtaka I, 326. Buddhaghosa says dvigu*n*a*m*
dupa*tt*a-sa*m*ghâ*t*i*m* eka*kk*iya*m* ekapa*tt*a*m*. Though 'single,'
the lengths of cotton cloth, pieced together, of which the robes were
made, were allowed to be doubled at the seams, the collar, the elbows,
and the knees. See above, VII, 1, 5.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[212:2](sbe17080.htm#fr_391.md) The waist cloth
(sa*m*ghâ*t*i) was wrapped round the waist and back, and secured with a
girdle. The under garment (antaravâsaka; see also the end of this note)
was wrapped round the loins and reached below the knee, being fastened
round the loins by an end of the cloth being tucked in there; and
sometimes also by a girdle. The upper robe (uttarâsa*m*ga) was wrapped
round the legs from the loins to the ankles, and the end was then drawn,
at the back, from the right hip, over the left shoulder, and either (as
is still the custom in Siam, and in the Siamese sect in Ceylon) allowed
to fall down in front, or (as is still the custom in Burma, and in the
Burmese sect in Ceylon) drawn back again over the right shoulder, and
allowed to fall down on the back. From the constant reference to the
practice of adjusting the robe over one shoulder as a special mark of
respect (for instance, Mahâvagga I, 29, 2; IV, 3. 3), the' Burmese
custom would seem to be in accordance with the most ancient way of
usually wearing the robe. The oldest statues of the Buddha, which
represent the robe as falling over only one shoulder, are probably later
than the passages just referred to.

The ordinary dress of laymen, even of good family, in Gotama's time was
much more scanty than the decent dress thus prescribed for the Bhikkhus.
See Rh. D.'s note on the 'Book of the Great Decease,' VI, 26. But it
consisted also, like that of the Bhikkhus, not in garments made with
sleeves or trousers, to fit the limbs, but in simple lengths of cloth.

The antara-vâsaka corresponds, in the dress of the monks, to <span
id="page_213">p. 213</span> the sâ*t*ika in the dress of ordinary women,
and was of the same shape as the udaka-sâ*t*ika, or bathing dress,
prescribed for the use both of monks (below, chapter 15) and of nuns
(Bhikkhunîvibhaṅga, Pâ*k*ittiya XXII). The latter was, however, somewhat
shorter.

The ordinary dress of the Bhikkhunîs or Sisters consisted of the same
three garments as that of the Bhikkhus.

<span id="fn_387"></span>[213:1](sbe17080.htm#fr_392.md) That is, according
to the first Nissaggiya. The first section of the Sutta-vibhaṅga on that
rule is identical with this section.
