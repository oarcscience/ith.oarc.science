### 19.

1\. Now at that time a family who were devoted to the venerable
Upananda, of the Sakya clan, sent hard food for the Sa*m*gha, saying,
'This is to be given to the Sa*m*gha with especial reference to the
venerable Upananda.'

Now at that time the venerable Upananda of the Sakya clan had gone forth
to the village for alms. And those men went to the Ârâma, and asked the
Bhikkhus:

'Where, Sirs, is the venerable Upananda?'

'The venerable Upananda of the Sakya clan has gone forth to the village
for alms.'

'This hard food, Sirs, is to be given to the Sa*m*gha, with especial
reference to the venerable Upananda.'

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'In that case, O Bhikkhus, receive it, a id put it aside till Upananda
returns.'

2\. And the venerable Upananda, after having attended on the families in
the forenoon, returned during the (after-part of the) day.

Now at that time, during the scarcity, people invited the Bhikkhus to a
slender meal; and they,

counting the numbers (of those invited, refused) the invitation. And the
whole Sa*m*gha was (once) invited; but the Bhikkhus, fearing to offend,
did not accept the invitation.

'Accept it, O Bhikkhus, that a Bhikkhu who has eaten, and who has
refused food still offered, may nevertheless eat food, if it have been
received before meal-time (in the forenoon), even if it has not been
left over <span id="fr_176"></span>[1](#fn_174).'
