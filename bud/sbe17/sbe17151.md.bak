### 6.

\[In this chapter the same rules for the Mânatta, or Penance, are laid
down word for word as those in chapter 1, §§ 1, 2, 3, and 4, for the
probation, reading throughout 'Bhikkhus who are going through the
Mânatta discipline' for 'Bhikkhus who have been placed under probation.'
There are, however, one or two minor points of difference, which are as
follows:

1\. At the end of the announcements (chapter 1,

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> § 2) there is
inserted the injunction, 'He ought to announce the fact every day.'

2\. In the passages about going from one residence to another (chapter
1, § 3) read 'unless with the Sa*m*gha' instead of 'unless with a
regular Bhikkhu.'\] <span id="fr_726"></span>[1](#fn_708.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_708"></span>[395:1](sbe17151.htm#fr_726.md) It will be seen,
therefore, that there is very little, one might almost say no practical,
difference between the Parivâsa, which we have rendered 'probation,' and
the Mânatta, which we have usually left untranslated, and sometimes
rendered 'penance.' Neither the one nor the other are at present
enforced anywhere among the Buddhists.
