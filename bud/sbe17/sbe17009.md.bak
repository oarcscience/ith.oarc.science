### 8.

1\. Now when the Blessed One had remained at Benares as long as he
thought fit, he set out on his journey towards Bhaddiya. And wandering
from place to place he came to Bhaddiya: and there, at Bhaddiya, he
stayed in the *G*âtiyâ Grove.

Now at that time the Bhikkhus at Bhaddiya were accustomed to the use of
various kinds of foot coverings for the sake of ornament. They made,

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

or had made for themselves foot coverings of ti*n*a-grass, of
mu*ñg*a-grass, of babba*g*a-grass, of the leaves of the date-palm <span
id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_44.md), of kamala-grass <span
id="fr_46"></span>[2](#fn_45.md), and of wool <span
id="fr_47"></span>[3](#fn_46.md). And they neglected <span
id="fr_48"></span>[4](#fn_47.md) instruction, enquiry, morality,
self-concentration, and wisdom <span id="fr_49"></span>[5](#fn_48.md).

2\. The moderate Bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry,
thinking, 'How can they \[do so\]?' And those Bhikkhus told this thing
to the Blessed One.

'Is it true' (&c., as in chap. 4. 2)?

'It is true, Lord.'

The Blessed Buddha rebuked them, saying, 'How can they \[do so\]?' This
will not conduce (&c., as in chap. 4. 2, down to:) becoming estranged.

3\. Having thus rebuked them, and having delivered a religious
discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'Shoes, O Bhikkhus, made of
ti*n*a-grass are not to be worn, or made of mu*ñg*a-grass, or of
babba*g*a-grass, or of leaves of the date-palm, or of kamala-grass, or
of wool, nor \[ornamented with\] gold, or silver, or pearls, or beryls,
or crystal, or copper, or glass, or tin, or lead, or bronze. Whosoever
does so, is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

'And clogs, O Bhikkhus, that are taken away <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_49.md), are not to be worn. Whosoever does so, is
guilty of a dukka*t*a offence.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of three kinds of clogs, that are
fixed to the ground, and are not taken away <span
id="fr_51"></span>[2](#fn_50.md), privy-clogs, urinal-clogs, and
rinsing-clogs <span id="fr_52"></span>[3](#fn_51.md).'

I, 119, 149, 178; IV, 42, it must be kamala, and not kambala as printed
by Fausböll, that is meant.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[23:4](sbe17009.htm#fr_48.md) On ri*ñk*anti
(Sanskrit ri*k*, ri*n*akti), compare the verses in Milinda Pa*ñ*ha, p.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[23:5](sbe17009.htm#fr_49.md) The
adhisîlâdi-sikkhâ-ttaya*m* mentioned at Dhp. p. 358 is explained in the
Sa*m*giti Sutta as training in adhisîla, adhi*k*itta, and adhipa*ññ*â.
On the first, compare the note on Mahâvagga I, 36, 8.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[24:1](sbe17009.htm#fr_50.md) See next clause.

bhûmiya*m* supati*tth*â ni*kk*alâ asa*m*hariyâ (sic), (B. here). Compare
Pâtimokkha, pp. 106, 113 (ed. Minayeff), and Childers's interpretation
of those passages under sa*m*kamati.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[24:3](sbe17009.htm#fr_52.md) On va*kk*a-pâdukâ,
see Kullavagga V, 35, 2, at the end; and VIII, 10, 3, at the beginning.
On the other two, *K*ullavagga V, 35; 1, 4, and VIII, 10, 3; and see
also VIII, 9. The use of them was part of the sanitary arrangements
enjoined upon the Order. A very ancient pair of stone va*kk*a-pâdukâ,
forming part of a slab of stone, was discovered at Anurâdhapura by Rhys
Davids, and is now in the Colombo Museum. As they were dug up in one of
the palaces there, they were probably for the use of the king, or some
high official. These ruins are among the most ancient in Ceylon, and are
certainly pre-Christian in date.
