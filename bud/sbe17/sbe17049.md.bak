### 35.

1\. Now the Blessed One proceeded straight on, on his alms-pilgrimage,
to Âpa*n*a. And Keniya the ascetic <span id="fr_233"></span>[2](#fn_229.md)
heard the saying, 'Behold! the Sama*n*a Gotama, who was born in the
Sâkya clan, and who went forth from the Sâkya clan (to adopt the
religious life), has arrived at Âpa*n*a, and is staying at Âpa*n*a. Now
regarding that venerable Gotama, such is the high reputation that has
been noised abroad that he is said to be a fully-enlightened one,
blessed and worthy, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with
knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed, who guides men as a driver curbs a
bullock, a teacher of gods and men, a blessed Buddha. He by himself
thoroughly understands, and sees, as it were face to face, this
universe, the world with its Devas, and with its Brahmas, and with its
Mâras, and all creatures, Sama*n*as and Brâhma*n*as, gods and men: and
he then makes his knowledge known to others. The truth doth he make
known, both in the spirit and in the letter:

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

lovely in its origin, lovely in its progress, lovely in its
consummation. The higher life doth he proclaim, in all its purity and
all its perfectness. Blessed is the sight of Arahats like that <span
id="fr_234"></span>[1](#fn_230.md)!' And Keniya the ascetic thought: 'What
now should I have taken <span id="fr_235"></span>[2](#fn_231.md) to the
Sama*n*a Gotama.'

2\. And Keniya the ascetic thought: 'They who are the ancient *Ri*shis
of the Brâhmans, the authors of the sacred verses, the utterers of the
sacred verses, whose ancient form of words, so uttered chaunted or
composed, the Brâhmans of to-day chaunt over again and repeat, intoning
or reciting exactly as had been intoned or recited--to wit, A*tth*aka,
Vâmaka, Vâmadeva, Vessâmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgirasa, Bhâradvâ*g*a,
Vâse*tth*a, and Bhagu <span id="fr_236"></span>[3](#fn_232.md)--they were
abstainers from food at night, and abstainers from food at the wrong
time, yet they used to receive such things as drinks. (3.) Now the
Sama*n*a Gotama is also an abstainer from food

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

at night, an abstainer from food at the wrong time <span
id="fr_237"></span>[1](#fn_233.md). It will be worthy of him too to receive
such things as drinks. And when he had had a quantity of drinkables made
ready he had them carried on pingoes and went up to the place where the
Blessed One was. And when he had come there, he greeted him; and after
exchanging with him the greetings of friendship and civility, he stood
by on one side. And so standing Keniya the ascetic spake thus to the
Blessed One:

'May the Blessed One accept at my hands these drinkables.'

'Very good then, Keniya; give them to the Bhikkhus.'

The Bhikkhus, fearing to offend, would not receive them.

'Receive them, O Bhikkhus, and make use of them.'

4\. Then Keniya the ascetic having, with his own hand, satisfied the
Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha with the Buddha at their head with many drinkables
until they refused any more, took his seat, when the Blessed One had
washed his hands, and had laid aside the bowl, on one side. And when he
was so seated the Blessed One taught and incited and aroused and
gladdened Keniya the ascetic with religious discourse: and Keniya the
ascetic, when he had been taught and incited and aroused and gladdened
by the Blessed One with religious discourse, spake thus to the Blessed
One:

'May the venerable Gotama grant to me the privilege of providing the
to-morrow's meal for him, together with the company of the Bhikkhus.'

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

5\. 'Great, O Keniya, is the company of the Bhikkhus. Two hundred and
fifty are the Bhikkhus in number. And thou art greatly devoted to the
Brâhmans.'

Yet a second time spake Keniya the ascetic to the Blessed One thus:

'What though the company of the Bhikkhus, O Gotama, be great; and though
two hundred and fifty be the number of the Bhikkhus. May the venerable
Gotama grant to me the privilege of providing the to-morrow's meal for
him, together with the company of the Bhikkhus.'

'Great, O Keniya (&c., as before).'

Yet a third time spake Keniya the ascetic to the venerable Gotama thus:

'What though the company of the Bhikkhus (&c., as before).'

Then the Blessed One granted, by remaining silent, his consent. And when
Keniya the ascetic perceived that the Blessed One had granted his
consent, he arose from his seat, and departed thence.

6\. Then the Blessed One on that occasion, and in that connection, after
he had delivered a religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and
said:

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, eight kinds of drink-able things: mango-syrup,
and jambu-syrup, and plantain-syrup <span
id="fr_238"></span>[1](#fn_234.md), and mo*k*a-syrup, and honey, and

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

grape juice, and syrup made from the edible root of the water-lily <span
id="fr_239"></span>[1](#fn_235.md), and phârusaka <span
id="fr_240"></span>[2](#fn_236.md)-syrup. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the
juice of all fruits, except the juice prepared from corn <span
id="fr_241"></span>[3](#fn_237.md). I allow you, O Bhikkhus, drinks
prepared from all leaves, except drinks prepared from potherbs <span
id="fr_242"></span>[4](#fn_238.md). I allow you, O Bhikkhus, drinks
prepared from all flowers, except liquorice-juice <span
id="fr_243"></span>[5](#fn_239.md). I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of the
juice of the sugar cane.'

7\. And Keniya the ascetic, at the end of the night, had sweet food,
both hard and soft, made ready at his hermitage: and he had the time
announced to the Blessed One, saying, 'It is time, O Gotama, and the
meal is ready.'

And the Blessed One, having put on his under robes early in the morning,
went, duly bowled and . robed, to the place where the hermitage of
Keniya the ascetic was. And when he had arrived there, he sat down on
the seat spread out for him, and with him the company of the Bhikkhus.
Then

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Keniya the
ascetic, with his own hand, offered to the company of the Bhikkhus with
the Buddha at their head, and satisfied them with the sweet food, both
hard and soft. And when the Blessed One had finished his meal and had
washed his hands and his bowl, he (Keniya) took his seat on one side.

8\. And when he was so seated the Blessed One pronounced the benediction
on Keniya the ascetic in these verses:

'Of the offerings <span id="fr_244"></span>[1](#fn_240.md) the fire
sacrifice is the chief, of sacred verses the chief is the Sâvitthi <span
id="fr_245"></span>[2](#fn_241.md);

'Among men the king is chief; and of waters the ocean,

'Of constellations the moon is chief, and of heat-givers the sun,

But of them, the conquering ones, who long after good, the Sa*m*gha,
verily, is chief.'

And when the Blessed One had, in these verses, pronounced the
benediction <span id="fr_246"></span>[3](#fn_242.md) on Keniya the ascetic,
he rose from his seat, and departed thence <span
id="fr_247"></span>[4](#fn_243.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_229"></span>[129:2](sbe17049.htm#fr_233.md) In Pâli
*G*a*t*ila; that is, 'one with long matted hair.' See our note on
Mahâvagga I, 15, I; and compare also Dîpava*m*sa I, 38; *G*âtaka I, 15,
84; Dhammapada, v. 141, and the passages quoted by Professor Oldenberg
in his edition of the *K*ullavagga, p. 350, and by Dr. Rhys Davids in
his 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' p. 185.

<span id="fn_230"></span>[130:1](sbe17049.htm#fr_234.md) This is a stock
phrase. Compare above VI, 34, II, and the Tevi*gg*a Sutta I, 7, 46, and
the passages quoted on the last by Rh. D., 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 287.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[130:2](sbe17049.htm#fr_235.md) That is, as a
present, the usual tribute of respect.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[130:3](sbe17049.htm#fr_236.md) The names of these
*Ri*shis, and the above phrases from 'They who' &c. downwards, recur
several times in the Tevi*gg*a Sutta. See Rh. D., 'Buddhist Suttas,' p.
172, &c. Most of these names are easily to be identified, being in
Sanskrit Vâmadeva, Vi*s*vâmitra, *G*amadagni (who is only mentioned in
this list in reference to Rig-veda III, 62, quoted from below. See also
Oldenberg's note to *S*âṅkhâyana's G*ri*hya-sûtra IV, 10 in Indische
Studien XV, 153), Âṅgirasa, Bhâradvâ*g*a, Vasish*th*a, Ka*s*yapa, and
Bh*ri*gu. The only doubtful names are Vâmaka and A*tth*aka. The latter
must be Ash*t*aka, mentioned as the author of Rig-veda X, 104, unless it
be supposed to be a corrupt reading under which some representation of
Atri may lurk. Vâmaka is the only unintelligible form, for it would be
difficult to see how that word could come to stand for the Vamra to whom
Rig-veda X, 99 is ascribed.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[131:1](sbe17049.htm#fr_237.md) See the eighth
section of the *K*ûla-sîla.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[132:1](sbe17049.htm#fr_238.md) So Buddhaghosa;
but it may also be cocoa-nut or cinnamon, according to Böhtlingk-Roth
sub voce. Buddhaghosa's words are Ko*k*a-pânan ti
a*tth*ika-kadali-phalehi kata-pâna*m*; and he explains mo*k*a by
ana*tth*ikehi kadali-phalehi kata-pâ*n*a*m*. As kadali is the ordinary
plantain or banana, which has no seeds, the meaning of the difference he
makes between the two kinds is not clear. The expression
eka*tth*ithâlapakka, at *G*âtaka I, 70, evidently rests on the same
meaning of the word atthi, which there also <span id="page_133">p.
133</span> cannot be, as usual, seed; for there is no such thing as a
palmyra fruit with one seed. See Rh. D.'s note on p. 94 of the 'Buddhist
Birth Stories.'

<span id="fn_235"></span>[133:1](sbe17049.htm#fr_239.md) In the text read
sâlûka.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[133:2](sbe17049.htm#fr_240.md) This is the Grewia
Asiatica of Linnaeus. See Böhtlingk-Roth under parûsaka.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[133:3](sbe17049.htm#fr_241.md) Toddy and arrack
are so prepared. The use of toddy was one of the famous Ten Points of
the heretics at the Council of Vesâlî. See below, *K*ullavagga XII, 1,
11. Buddhaghosa explains this as 'drink made from any one of the seven
kinds of corn;' where the seven kinds referred to must be those
mentioned in the Abhidhâna-ppadîpikâ, verses 450, 451.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[133:4](sbe17049.htm#fr_242.md) *D*âka = sâka.
Compare our note below on VI, 36, 8, and *G*âtaka, ed. Fausböll, I, 308.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[133:5](sbe17049.htm#fr_243.md)
Madhuka-puppha-rasa*m*; Madhuka is the Bassia Latifolia of Linnaeus.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[134:1](sbe17049.htm#fr_244.md) Ya*ññ*â. Compare
above, I, 22, 4, and our note there (p. 138).

<span id="fn_241"></span>[134:2](sbe17049.htm#fr_245.md) This is of course
the well-known verse Rig-veda III, 62, 10. The argumentum ad hominem
here is a fresh confirmation of the view already expressed above in our
note on I, 15, 1, that by the *G*atilas are to be understood the
orthodox Brâhman ascetics.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[134:3](sbe17049.htm#fr_246.md) Compare the Book
of the Great Decease I, 31, and *G*âtaka I, 119.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[134:4](sbe17049.htm#fr_247.md) §§ 7, 8 recur in
the Sela Sutta (Sutta Nipâta, III, 7, 21, 22), where they stand in a
much more appropriate context.
