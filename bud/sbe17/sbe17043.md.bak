### 29.

1\. And the Blessed One went to Ko*t*igâma. There at Ko*t*igâma the
Blessed One resided. And the Blessed One thus addressed the Bhikkhus:

'It is through not understanding and grasping four Noble Truths, O
Bhikkhus, that we have had to run so long, to wander so long in this
weary path of transmigration, both you and I. And what are

these four? By not understanding and grasping the Noble Truth of
Suffering, O Bhikkhus; by not understanding and grasping the Noble Truth
of the Cause of suffering; by not understanding and grasping the Noble
Truth of the Cessation of suffering; by not understanding and grasping
the Noble Truth of the Path which leads to the cessation of suffering:
thereby we have had to run so long, to wander so long in this weary path
of trans-migration, both you and I.

2\. 'But now, O Bhikkhus, the Noble Truth of Suffering is understood and
grasped;' the Noble Truth of the Cause of suffering, &c., of the
Cessation of suffering, &c., of the Path which leads to the cessation of
suffering is understood and grasped. The craving for existence is rooted
out; that which leads to renewed existence is destroyed; and there is no
more birth!

'By not seeing the four Noble Truths as they really are, long is the
path that is traversed through many a birth.

'Now these are grasped; the cause of birth is removed, the root of
sorrow rooted out, and there is no more birth.'
