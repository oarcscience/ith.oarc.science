### 6.

1\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus used to get up on to couches or chairs
with unwashen feet; and the robes and seats became soiled.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I enjoin, O Bhikkhus, the use of foot coverings when one of you wishes
to get up on to couches or chairs.'

2\. Now at that time when the Bhikkhus were going to the Uposatha Hall
or to the assembly in the dark, they trod upon stakes or thorns, and
their feet were hurt.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I enjoin, O Bhikkhus, the use of foot coverings in the open Ârâma, and
of a torch, or lamp, and a walking stick <span

3\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to rise up in the
night towards dawn; and, putting on wooden shoes, walked up and down in
the open air talking, in tones high, loud, and harsh, of all kinds of
worldly things--such as tales of kings, of robbers, of ministers of
state; tales of armies, of terror, of war; conversation respecting
meats, drinks, clothes, couches, garlands, perfumes, relationships,
equipages, villages, towns, cities, provinces, women, warriors, and
streets; tales about buried treasures, ghost stories; various tales;
discussions

on the world; disasters by sea; things which are, and things which are
not <span id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_42). And so doing they both trod
upon and slew all kinds of insects, and disturbed the Bhikkhus in their
meditations.

4\. The moderate Bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry,
saying, 'How can the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus \[do so\]?'

And those Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.

'Is it true' (&c., comp. chap. 4. 2)?

'It is true, Lord.'

He rebuked them, and having delivered a religious discourse, he
addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: Wooden shoes, O Bhikkhus, are not to
be worn. Whosoever wears them, is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence.'
