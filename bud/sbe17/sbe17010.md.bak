### 9.

1\. Now when the Blessed One had remained at Bhaddiya as long as he
thought fit, he set out on a journey towards Sâvatthi. And walking from
place to place he arrived at Sâvatthi. There the Blessed One dwelt at
Sâvatthi at the *G*etavana, Anâtha-pi*nd*ika's Grove.

2\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to catch hold of
the heifers crossing on the A*k*iravatî River by their horns, or ears,
or dewlaps, or tails <span id="fr_53"></span>[4](#fn_52.md), or spring up
upon their backs, or touch with lustful

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

thoughts their privy parts: and they used to duck the young calves and
so kill them. People were annoyed, murmured, and became angry, saying,
'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as \[act thus\]? it is like men still
enjoying the pleasures of the world.'

And Bhikkhus heard them murmuring in annoyance and indignation: and
those Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.

'Is it true' (&c., see chap. 4. 2)?

'It is true, Lord.'

He rebuked them, and having delivered a religious discourse, he
addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

'Heifers are not to be caught hold of, O Bhikkhus, by their horns, or
their ears, or their dewlaps, or their tails. You are not to get up on
their backs. Whosoever gets up on their backs, is guilty of a dukka*t*a
offence. And their privy parts, O Bhikkhus, are not to be touched with
lustful thoughts. Whosoever does so, is guilty of a thulla*kk*aya
offence. And calves ought not to be killed. Whosoever kills them, let
him be dealt with according to law <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_53.md).'

3\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to have themselves
carried in vehicles to which cows were yoked with a bull between them,
or bulls were yoked with a cow between them <span
id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_54.md). People were annoyed, murmured, and became
angry, saying, 'That is as is done at the Feast of the Gaṅgâ and the
Mahî <span id="fr_56"></span>[3](#fn_55.md).'

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'Do not have yourselves carried in vehicles, O Bhikkhus. Whosoever does
so, is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence.'

<span id="fn_54"></span>[25:2](sbe17010.htm#fr_55.md) Buddhaghosa explains
this passage in a different way: Itthi-yuttenâ ’ti dhenu-yuttena.
Purisantarenâ ’ti purisa-sârathinâ. Purisa-yuttenâ ’ti go*n*a-yuttena.

Earth; but it is probably the <span id="page_26">p. 26</span> well-known
affluent of the Ganges, which is one of the Mahânadîs. Compare
