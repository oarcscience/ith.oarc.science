### 20.

1\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus were fully provided with the three
robes, but they had need of water-strainers <span
id="fr_424"></span>[1](#fn_416.md) and of bags (to carry their bowls and
other things in) <span id="fr_425"></span>[2](#fn_417.md).

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, pieces of cloth requisite (for those
purposes).'

2\. Then it occurred to the Bhikkhus: 'The things allowed by the Blessed
One--the three robes, and the robes for the rainy season, and the mat,
and the bed-covering, and the cloth to cover boils &c. with, and to wipe
the face with, and required (for water-strainers and bags)--are all
these things things which ought to be kept to ourselves <span
id="fr_426"></span>[3](#fn_418.md), or things which ought to be handed
over <span id="fr_427"></span>[4](#fn_419.md) (from time to time by one
Bhikkhu to another)?'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to keep in hand the three robes, and not to
assign them--to keep to yourselves the robes for the rainy season during
the four months of the rains, but beyond that time to hand them over--to
keep to yourselves the mats and the bed coverings, and not to hand them
over--to keep to yourselves the coverings for the itch &c. while the
disease lasts, but beyond that time to

hand them over--to keep to yourselves the cloths to wipe the face with,
and those required for water-strainers and bags, and not to hand them
over.'
