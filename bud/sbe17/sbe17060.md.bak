### 6.

1\. 'A Bhikkhu, after the Ka*th*ina ceremony has been held, takes a
robe, and goes away. And when he has got beyond the boundary he thinks,
"I will have the robe made up here, and will never go back." And he gets
the robe made up.

'That Bhikkhu's Ka*th*ina privileges are suspended on the ground of his
having a robe ready for wear, &c. <span id="fr_316"></span>[1](#fn_311.md)

2\. 'A Bhikkhu, after the Ka*th*ina ceremony has been held, takes a robe
and goes away, thinking, "I will never come back." And when he has got
beyond the boundary he thinks, "I will have the robe made up here." And
he gets the robe made up, &c. <span id="fr_317"></span>[2](#fn_312.md)

3\. 'A Bhikkhu, after the Ka*th*ina ceremony has been held, takes a robe
and goes away, without taking a resolution; he neither thinks "I will
come back," nor does he think "I will not come back." And when he has
got beyond the boundary, &c. <span id="fr_318"></span>[3](#fn_313.md)

and goes away, thinking,

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_311"></span>[161:1](sbe17060.htm#fr_316.md) This case is word
for word identical with the second case in chap. 2. 1. After it follow
the third and fourth case of chap. 2. 1, which it is unnecessary to
print here again in full extent. The triad of these cases is repeated
here in order to serve as a basis for the variations which are to follow
in §§ 2, 3.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[161:2](sbe17060.htm#fr_317.md) The triad of § 1
is repeated here, with the difference, as is seen from the opening
clauses which we have fully printed, that the Bhikkhu, before he has got
beyond the boundary, and not afterwards as in § 1, resolves upon not
returning to the âvâsa.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[161:3](sbe17060.htm#fr_318.md) The whole triad as
in § 1. The only difference between § 3 and § 1 consists in the
following words being added in § 3 in each of the three cases, 'without
taking a resolution; he neither thinks "I will come back," nor does he
think "I will not come back."'

<span id="fn_314"></span>[162:1](sbe17060.htm#fr_319.md) Supply here the
whole triad as in § 1, the words 'thinking "I will come back"' being
constantly added. After this triad follow three other cases which are
exactly identical with the three contained in chap. 2. 2.
