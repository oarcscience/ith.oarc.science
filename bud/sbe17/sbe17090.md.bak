### 23.

1\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu who had deposited his robes <span
id="fr_442"></span>[3](#fn_434.md) in Andhavana entered the

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

village for alms (clad only) in his waist cloth and nether garment <span
id="fr_443"></span>[1](#fn_435.md). Thieves carried off that robe. That
Bhikkhu became ragged and ill-clad.

The Bhikkhus spake thus: 'How is it, friend, that you have become ragged
and ill-clad?'

'I had deposited my robe in Andhavana, and entered the village in my
waist cloth and nether garment. Thieves carried off that robe., Thence
am I become ragged and ill-clad.'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to enter the village (clad only) in your waist
cloth and nether garment. Whosoever shall do so is guilty of a
dukka*t*a <span id="fr_444"></span>[2](#fn_436.md).'

2\. Now at that time the venerable Ânanda through thoughtlessness went
into the village for alms in his waist cloth and nether garment.

The Bhikkhus spake to him thus: 'Hath it not been laid down by the
Blessed One that we are not to enter the village in our waist cloth and
nether garment. Why have you, O friend, gone so into the village?'

'It is true, my friends, that it has been laid down by the Blessed One
that we are not to enter the village so, but I did it out of
thoughtlessness.'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

3\. 'There are five reasons, O Bhikkhus, for laying

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

aside the robe <span id="fr_445"></span>[1](#fn_437.md)--when he (the
Bhikkhu) is sick, when it is the appointed time for keeping the rainy
season <span id="fr_446"></span>[2](#fn_438.md), when it is necessary to go
to the other side of a river, when the vihâra has been securely fastened
with a bolt <span id="fr_447"></span>[3](#fn_439.md), when the Ka*th*ina
ceremony has been performed <span id="fr_448"></span>[4](#fn_440.md).
These, O Bhikkhus, are the five reasons for laying aside the robe
(Sa*m*ghâ*t*i).

'There are five reasons, O Bhikkhus, for laying aside the waist cloth
and the nether garment. \[The reasons are the same as in the last
paragraph.\] These, O Bhikkhus, are the five reasons, &c.

'There are five reasons for laying aside the garment for use in the
rainy season--when he is sick, when it is necessary to go beyond the
boundary (?) <span id="fr_449"></span>[5](#fn_441.md), when it is necessary
to go to the other side of a river, when the vihâra has been securely
fastened with a bolt, when the garment for use in the rainy

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

season has not been made, or has been left unfinished <span
id="fr_450"></span>[1](#fn_442.md).

'These, O Bhikkhus, are the five reasons,' &c.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_434"></span>[232:3](sbe17090.htm#fr_442.md) For the rule as to
such depositing, see the 29th Nissaggiya. <span id="page_233">p.
233</span> *K*îvara (robe) must here be used for Sa*m*ghâ*t*i. See our
note on VIII, 13, 5, and section 2, below, where sa*m*ghâ*t*i occurs.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[233:1](sbe17090.htm#fr_443.md) On Santaruttara,
see the 7th Nissaggiya. It is clear from this passage that Buddhaghosa
was right in his limitation of the word as used in that rule; and we
should have done better, therefore, to follow it in our translation of
the rule.

<span id="fn_436"></span>[233:2](sbe17090.htm#fr_444.md) Compare the 1st,
2nd, 3rd, and 4th Sekhiyas, and the 2nd Nissaggiya; and also above, VII,
1, 3.

<span id="fn_437"></span>[234:1](sbe17090.htm#fr_445.md) Here the word used
is Sa*m*ghâ*t*i.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[234:2](sbe17090.htm#fr_446.md) On sa*m*keta,
compare II, 8, 1. Buddhaghosa merely says here, Vassika-sa*m*ketan ti
*k*attâro mâse. As sa*m*keta implies a mutual agreement, the 'appointed
time' here probably means, not the time fixed by the Buddha, but the
time agreed upon by the Sa*m*gha as that to which the rule laid down by
the Buddha should apply. There may easily have arisen questions as to
the exact day on which the four months should properly begin; and there
were even differences of opinion as to the exact length of the period
itself, some making it three, and some four months. See on these points
Childers, under Vassa and Vassûpanâyikâ.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[234:3](sbe17090.htm#fr_447.md) From fear of
thieves.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[234:4](sbe17090.htm#fr_448.md) See the and
Nissaggiya, and above, VII, 1, 3.

<span id="fn_441"></span>[234:5](sbe17090.htm#fr_449.md) Buddhaghosa has
nothing on this reason. It would seem that the garment in question might
be left behind when the Bhikkhu had to go on a journey, if that journey
would take him beyond the boundary of the technical 'residence.' On the
use of the word, see the passages collected by H.-O. in the Index to the
Pâli Text (vol. ii. p. 349, s.v. sîmâ.).

<span id="fn_442"></span>[235:1](sbe17090.htm#fr_450.md) It is evident from
this last reason that the reasons are not such as would justify a
Bhikkhu in laying aside the garment in such a way as to remain naked,
but such as would justify him in not using the rainy-season garment when
he might otherwise have done so. In the five cases mentioned he might
wear the nether garment only reaching from above the navel to below the
knees, instead of the garment for the rainy season, which was smaller in
size. See our note above on VIII, 13, 5, and VIII, 15, 15.
