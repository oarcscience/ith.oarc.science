1\. There are, O Bhikkhus, these eight grounds <span
id="fr_488"></span>[2](#fn_480.md) for the getting of a gift of robes--when
he gives it to the boundary, when he gives it to (a Sa*m*gha which is)
under agreement (with other Sa*m*ghas), when he gives it on a
declaration of alms, when he gives it to the Sa*m*gha, when he gives it
to both the Sa*m*ghas, when he gives it to the Sa*m*gha which has spent
the rainy season (at the place), when he gives it to a specified
number <span id="fr_489"></span>[3](#fn_481.md), when he gives it to a
single Bhikkhu.

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

'When he gives it to the boundary, it is to be divided among all those
Bhikkhus who have come within the boundary <span
id="fr_490"></span>[1](#fn_482.md).

'When he gives it to a Sa*m*gha which is under agreement, there are a
number of residences which hold in common whatever they get, and what is
given in one residence is given in all.

'When he gives it on a declaration of alms (means when the givers say),
"We give it at the place where constant supply of alms is kept up for
the Sa*m*gha <span id="fr_491"></span>[2](#fn_483.md)."

'When he gives it to the Sa*m*gha, it is to be divided among the
Sa*m*gha there present.

'When he gives it to both the Sa*m*ghas, though there be many Bhikkhus
and only one Bhikkhunî, an equal half is to be given (to each of the two
Sa*m*ghas), and though there be many Bhikkhunîs and only one Bhikkhu, an
equal half is to be given (to each of the two Sa*m*ghas).

'When he gives it to the Sa*m*gha which has spent the rainy season, it
is to be divided among as many Bhikkhus as have spent the rainy season
at that particular residence.

'When he gives it to a specified number, it is the number present at the
giving of congey, or

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

rice, or hard food, or robes, or bedding, or medicine <span
id="fr_492"></span>[1](#fn_484.md).

'When he gives it to a single Bhikkhu, he says, "I give a set of robes
to such and such a one."'

# NINTH KHANDHAKA.

#### (VALIDITY AND INVALIDITY OF FORMAL ACTS OF THE SA*M*GHA.)

### 1.

1\. At that time the blessed Buddha dwelt at *K*ampâ, on the brink of
the lotus-pond Gaggarâ. At that time there was in the country of Kâsi (a
village) called Vâsabha-gâma. There a Bhikkhu called Kassapa-gotta had
his residence, who was bound (to that place) by the string (of the
religious duties which he had to perform there <span
id="fr_493"></span>[1](#fn_485).md), and who exerted himself to the end
that clever Bhikkhus from a distance might come to that place, and the
clever Bhikkhus therein might live at ease, and that (religious life at
that residence might progress, advance, and reach a high state.

Now at that time a number of Bhikkhus, making their pilgrimage in the
country of Kâsi, came to Vâsabha-gâma. And the Bhikkhu Kassapa-gotta saw
those Bhikkhus coming from afar; when he saw them, he prepared seats for
them, brought water for the washing of their feet, a foot-stool, and a
towel <span id="fr_494"></span>[2](#fn_486.md).

Then he went forth to meet them, took their bowls and their robes,
offered them (water) to drink, and provided a bath for them, and
provided also rice-milk and food hard and soft.

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

Now those stranger Bhikkhus thought: 'The resident Bhikkhu here, O
friends, is indeed good-natured; he provides a bath for us and provides
also rice-milk, and food, hard and soft. What if we were to stay here,
friends, at Vâsabha-gâma.' Thus those stranger Bhikkhus stayed there at
Vâsabha-gâma.

2\. Now the Bhikkhu Kassapa-gotta thought: 'These stranger Bhikkhus are
rested now from their travel-weariness; they did not know their way here
before, but now they know their way. It is trouble-some indeed to be
busy all one's life for people not related to one's self, and being
asked <span id="fr_495"></span>[1](#fn_487.md) is disagreeable to men. What
if I were to provide no longer rice-milk, and food, hard and soft (for
those Bhikkhus).' Thus he did not provide any more (for them) rice-milk,
and food, hard and soft.

Then those stranger Bhikkhus thought: 'Formerly, friends, this resident
Bhikkhu used to provide baths for us, and to provide also rice-milk, and
food, hard and soft. But now he does not provide any more rice-milk, and
food, hard and soft. This resident Bhikkhu, friends, is in anger with us
now. Well, friends, let us pronounce expulsion against this resident
Bhikkhu.'

3\. Then those stranger Bhikkhus assembled and said to the Bhikkhu'
Kassapa-gotta: 'Formerly, friend, you used to provide baths for us and
to provide also rice-milk, and food, hard and soft. But now you do not
provide any more rice-milk, and food, hard and soft. You have committed
an offence, friend; do you see that offence?'

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

'There is no offence, friends, for me to see.'

Then those stranger Bhikkhus pronounced expulsion against the Bhikkhu
Kassapa-gotta for his refusal to see that (pretended) offence. Then the
Bhikkhu Kassapa-gotta thought: 'I do not know indeed whether this is an
offence or not, and whether I have made myself guilty of an offence or
not, and whether I have been expelled or not, and whether that sentence
is lawful or unlawful, objectionable or unobjectionable, valid or
invalid. What if I were to go to *K*ampâ and to ask the Blessed One
about this matter?'

4\. And the Bhikkhu Kassapa-gotta put his resting-place in order, took
up his alms-bowl and his robe, and went forth to *K*ampâ; and in due
course he came to *K*ampâ and to the place where the Blessed One was.
Having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat
down near him.

Now it is the custom of the blessed Buddhas to exchange greeting with
incoming Bhikkhus. And the Blessed One said to the Bhikkhu
Kassapa-gotta: 'Is it all well with you, O Bhikkhu? Do you find your
living? Have you made your journey without too much fatigue? And from
what plate do you come, O Bhikkhu?'

'It is all well, Lord; I find my living, Lord; I have made the journey,
Lord, without too much fatigue:

5\. 'There is in the country of Kâsi, Lord, (a village) called
Vâsabha-gâma. There I had my residence, Lord, (&c. <span
id="fr_496"></span>[1](#fn_488), down to:.md) Then those

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

stranger Bhikkhus, Lord, pronounced against me expulsion for my refusal
to see that offence. Then I thought, Lord: "I do not know indeed whether
this is an offence or not, and whether I have made myself guilty of an
offence or not, and whether I have been expelled or not, and whether
that sentence is lawful or unlawful, objectionable or unobjectionable,
valid or invalid. What if I were to go to *K*ampâ and to ask the Blessed
One about this matter." Thus I have come here, Lord.'

6\. (Buddha replied): 'This is no offence, O Bhikkhu; it is not an
offence. You are innocent; you are not guilty of an offence. You are not
expelled, and have not been expelled; the sentence by which you have
been expelled is unlawful, objectionable, and invalid. Go, O Bhikkhu,
and settle yourself again at Vâsabha-gâma.'

The Bhikkhu Kassapa-gotta expressed his assent to the Blessed One (by
saying), 'Yes, Lord,' rose from his seat, and having respectfully
saluted the Blessed One and walked round him with his right side towards
him, he went on his way to Vâsabha-gâma.

7\. Now those stranger Bhikkhus (at Vâsabha-gâma) were overcome by
scruples and remorse:

It is all loss to us indeed, it is no gain to us; we will fare ill
indeed, we will not fare well, in this that we have expelled that pure,
guiltless Bhikkhu without any cause and reason. Well, friends, let us go
to *K*ampâ and let us confess there in the Blessed One's presence our
sin in its sinfulness.'

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

And those stranger Bhikkhus put their resting-places in order, took up
their alms-bowls and their robes, and went forth to *K*ampâ, and in due
course they came to *K*ampâ and to the place where the Blessed One was.
Having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, they sat
down near him. Now it is the custom of the blessed Buddhas (&c. <span
id="fr_497"></span>[1](#fn_489), down to:.md) 'It is all well, Lord; we
find our living, Lord; we have made the journey, Lord, without too much
fatigue. There is in the country of Kâsi, Lord, (a village) called
Vâsabha-gâma; from that place we come, Lord.'

8\. 'So are you, O Bhikkhus, those who have expelled the resident
Bhikkhu there?'

'We are, Lord.'

'For what cause, O Bhikkhus, and for what reason?'

'Without any cause and reason, Lord.'

Then the Blessed One rebuked those Bhikkhus: 'That is improper, O
Bhikkhus, it is unbecoming, indecent, unworthy of Sama*n*as,
unallowable, and to be avoided. How can you, O fools, expel a pure and
guiltless Bhikkhu, without any cause and reason? This will not do, O
Bhikkhus, for converting the unconverted.' Having thus rebuked them and
delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'Let no
one, O Bhikkhus, expel a pure and guiltless Bhikkhu without cause and
reason. He who does, commits a dukka*t*a offence.'

9\. Then those Bhikkhus rose from their seats, adjusted their upper
robes so as to cover one

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

shoulder, prostrated themselves, inclining their heads to the feet of
the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One: 'Transgression, O Lord,
has overcome us like the foolish, like the erring, like the unhappy, in
this that we have expelled a pure, guiltless Bhikkhu without any cause
and reason. May, O Lord, the Blessed One accept (the confession of) our
sin in its sinfulness, and we will refrain from it in future.'

'Truly, O Bhikkhus, transgression has overcome you like the foolish,
like the erring, like the unhappy, in that you have expelled a pure,
guiltless Bhikkhu without any cause and reason. But as you see, O
Bhikkhus, your sin in its sinfulness, and duly make amends for it, we
accept it from you. For this, O Bhikkhus, is called progress in the
discipline of the noble one, if one sees his sin in its sinfulness, and
duly makes amends for it, and refrains from it in future.'
