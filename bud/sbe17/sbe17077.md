### 10.

1\. At that time the Bhikkhus dyed cloth with (cow-)dung or with yellow
clay. The robes were badly coloured.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you use the following six kinds of dye,
viz. dye made of roots, dye made of trunks of trees, dye made of bark,
dye made of leaves, dye made of flowers, dye made of fruits.'

2\. At that time the Bhikkhus dyed cloth with unboiled dye; the cloth
became ill-smelling.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you boil the dye (and use) little
dye-pots.'

They spilt the dye.

'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you put basins (under the dye-pots) to
catch the spilt (dye).'

At that time the Bhikkhus did not know whether the dye was boiled or
not.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you let a drop of dye fall into water, or
on to your nail (in order to try if the dye is duly boiled).'

3\. At that time the Bhikkhus, when pouring the dye out (of the pot),
upset the pot; the pot was broken.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you use a dye-ladle or a scoop with a
long handle.'

At that time the Bhikkhus did not possess vessels for keeping dye.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you get jars and bowls for keeping the
dye.'

At that time the Bhikkhus rubbed the cloth against the vessels and the
bowls (in which they dyed it); the cloth was rent.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

' prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you use a (large) trough for dying (cloth)
in.'
