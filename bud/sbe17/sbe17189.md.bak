### 36.

1\. \[The same nine cases of the throwing back is carried by unlawful
proceeding, though the Mânatta and the rehabilitation are by a lawful
proceeding.\]

2\. 'And in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu is guilty of a number of
Sa*m*ghâdisesa offences--definite, and not definite--of one designation,
and of various designations--similar to each other, and
dissimilar--connected with each other, and disconnected <span

probation on account of those offences. The Sa*m*gha imposes upon him an
additional probation on account of those offences. He undergoing that
probation is guilty meanwhile of a number of Sa*m*ghâdisesa offences,
definite ones, which he does conceal. He asks the Sa*m*gha to throw him
back on account

of those intervening offences to the commencement of his term of
probation. The Sa*m*gha \[does so\] by an unlawful proceeding that is
liable to be quashed, and unfit for the occasion; and it also imposes an
inclusive probation upon him, but by an unlawful proceeding. He
thinking, "I am undergoing that probation," is guilty meanwhile of a
number of Sa*m*ghâdisesa offences, definite ones, which he does conceal.
When he has arrived at this condition he calls to mind the other
offences committed while the first offences were being committed, and he
calls to mind also the other offences committed while the latter
offences were being committed.

Then it occurs to him, "I have been guilty of a number of Sa*m*ghâdisesa
offences (&c., as in the whole of the section from the beginning to the
end of the last paragraph, down to) and I called to mind also the. other
offences committed while the latter offences were being committed. Let
me now ask the Sa*m*gha to throw me back on account of those offences
committed while the former offences, and while the latter offences, were
being committed, to the commencement of my term of probation, by a
lawful proceeding that cannot be quashed, and is fit for the occasion;
and let me ask for an inclusive probation to be imposed by a lawful
proceeding, and for a Mânatta to be imposed by a lawful proceeding, and
then for rehabilitation by a lawful proceeding."

'And he asks the Sa*m*gha \[accordingly\], and the Sa*m*gha \[does so\].
That Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, is purified from those offences.'

\[The same if some of the offences in each case have been concealed and
some not concealed.\]

<span id="page_439">p. 439</span>

3, 4. \[The Bhikkhu is not purified from such intervening and remembered
offences as are specified in the last section, if the Sa*m*gha has
proceeded, as in the first section of this chapter, by an unlawful
proceeding.\]
