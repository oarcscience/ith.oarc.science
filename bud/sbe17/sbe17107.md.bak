### 2.

1\. At that time the Bhikkhus, among whom altercations, contentions, and
quarrels had arisen, in the dining-hall and amidst the houses, behaved

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

improperly towards each other in gesture and word, and came to blows.

The people were annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), 'How can
these Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as, when altercations, contentions, and
quarrels have arisen among them, &c., and come to blows?' Some Bhikkhus
heard those people that were annoyed, murmured, and had become angry.
The moderate Bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying),
'How can the Bhikkhus, when altercations, &c.?'

These Bhikkhus told the thing to the Blessed One.

'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, &c.?'

'It is true, Lord.'

Having rebuked them, and delivered a religious discourse, he thus
addressed the Bhikkhus: 'When divisions have arisen among the Sa*m*gha,
O Bhikkhus, and when unlawful conduct and unfriendliness prevail among
the Bhikkhus, then you ought to sit down on your seats (separately,
saying to yourselves): "At least we will not behave improperly towards
each other in gesture or word, and will not come to blows." When
divisions have arisen among the Sa*m*gha, O Bhikkhus, and when lawful
conduct' and friendliness prevail among the Bhikkhus, then you may sit
down (together), one by one from each side <span
id="fr_561"></span>[1](#fn_551.md).'

At that time the Bhikkhus, among whom altercations, contentions, and
quarrels had arisen, wounded each other with sharp words in the
assemblies, and were unable to settle that question.

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

Then a certain Bhikkhu went to the place where the Blessed One was;
having approached him and respectfully saluted him, he stationed himself
near him. Standing near him, that Bhikkhu said to the Blessed One:
'Lord, the Bhikkhus among whom altercations, contentions, and quarrels
have arisen, wound each other with sharp words in the assemblies, and
are unable to settle that question. Pray, Lord, may the Blessed One go
to those Bhikkhus out of compassion towards them.'

And the Blessed One expressed his consent by remaining silent.

Then the Blessed One went to the place where those Bhikkhus were; having
approached them, he sat down on the seat they had prepared. Sitting
there the Blessed One thus addressed those Bhikkhus: 'Enough, O
Bhikkhus, no altercations, no contentions, no disunion, no quarrel!'

When he had spoken thus, a certain Bhikkhu, an adherer of the party who
were wrong, said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One, the
king of Truth, be patient! Lord, may the Blessed One quietly enjoy the
bliss he has obtained already in this life! The responsibility for these
altercations and contentions, for this disunion and quarrel will rest
with us alone.'

And for the second time the Blessed One thus addressed those Bhikkhus:
'Enough, O Bhikkhus, &c.' And for the second time that Bhikkhu who
adhered to the party who were wrong, said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, may
the Blessed One, &c.' Then the Blessed One spoke thus to those Bhikkhus:

3\. 'In former times, O Bhikkhus, there lived at

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Benares a king of
Kâsi, Brahmadatta by name, wealthy, rich in treasures, rich in revenues,
rich in troops and vehicles, the lord over a great realm, with full
treasuries and storehouses. And there was also a king of Kosala, Dîghîti
by name, not wealthy, poor in treasures, poor in revenues, poor in
troops and vehicles, the lord over a small realm, with empty treasuries
and storehouses.

'And king Brahmadatta, O Bhikkhus, of Kâsi, having set the four hosts of
his army in array, went out to war with king Dîghîti of Kosala.

'And king Dîghîti of Kosala heard, O Bhikkhus: "King Brahmadatta of
Kâsi, having set the four hosts of his army in array, has gone out to
war with me." Then king Dîghîti of Kosala thought, O Bhikkhus: "King
Brahmadatta of Kâsi is wealthy, rich in treasures, &c.; and I am not
wealthy, poor in treasures, &c. I am not able to stand against even one
attack of king Brahmadatta of Kâsi. What if I were to flee from the town
beforehand."

'And king Dîghîti of Kosala, O Bhikkhus, took his queen-consort with him
and fled from the town beforehand.

Then king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, conquered the troops and
vehicles, the realm, the treasuries and storehouses of king Dîghîti of
Kosala, and took possession of them.

And king Dîghîti of Kosala, O Bhikkhus, together with his consort, went
forth to Benares. Wandering from place to place he came to Benares, and
there at Benares, O Bhikkhus, king Dîghîti of Kosala dwelt, together
with his consort, at a certain place near the town, in a potter's
dwelling, in disguise, in the guise of a wandering ascetic.

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

4\. 'And ere long, O Bhikkhus, the queen-consort of king Dîghîti of
Kosala became pregnant. And there came upon her the longing of pregnant
women; and she desired, at sunrise, to see an army, with its four hosts
set in array, clad in armour, standing on auspicious ground, and to
drink the water in which the swords were washed.

'And the queen-consort, O Bhikkhus, of king Dîghîti of Kosala said to
king Dîghîti of Kosala: "I am pregnant, Lord, and the longing of
pregnancy has come upon me; and I desire, at sunrise, &c."

'(The king replied): "Whence shall come, O queen, to people in distress
like us, an army with four hosts set in array, clad in armour, standing
on auspicious ground, and the water in which the swords are washed?"

'(The queen said): "If I do not obtain it, Lord, I shall die."

5\. 'Now at that time, O Bhikkhus, the Brâhma*n*a who was domestic
chaplain to king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, was a friend of king Dîghîti of
Kosala. And king Dîghîti of Kosala, O Bhikkhus, went to the place where
that Brâhma*n*a, the domestic chaplain to king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, was;
having approached him he said to that Brâhma*n*a, the domestic chaplain
to king Brahmadatta of Kâsi: "Your lady-friend, my beloved, is pregnant,
and the longing of pregnant women has come upon her; and she desires
(&c., as above)."

'(The Brâhma*n*a replied): "Well, O king, let us see the queen also."

'Then, O Bhikkhus, the queen-consort of king Dîghîti of Kosala went to
the place where that Brâhma*n*a, the domestic chaplain to king
Brahmadatta

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

of Kâsi, was. And, O Bhikkhus, that Brâhma*n*a, the domestic chaplain to
king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, saw the queen-consort of king Dîghîti of
Kosala coming from afar. On seeing her he rose from his seat, adjusted
his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, raised his joined hands to
the queen-consort of king Dîghîti of Kosala, and three times uttered
this exclamation: "Verily a Kosala king dwells in thy womb! Verily a
Kosala king dwells in thy womb!" (And further he said): "Do not despond,
O queen, you will obtain the sight at sunrise of an army with its four
hosts set in array, clad in armour, standing on auspicious ground, and
you will obtain the drinking of the water in which the swords are
washed."

6\. And, O Bhikkhus, that Brâhma*n*a, the domestic chaplain to king
Brahmadatta of Kâsi, went to the place where king Brahmadatta of Kâsi
was. Having approached him, he said to king Brahmadatta of Kâsi: "Lord,
the signs that appear are such, that to-morrow at sunrise an army with
four hosts, set in array, clad in armour, must station itself on
auspicious ground, and the swords must be washed."

Then, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kâsi gave order to his attendants:
"Do, my friends, what the Brâhma*n*a, my domestic chaplain, tells you."

'Thus, O Bhikkhus, the queen-consort of king Dîghîti of Kosala obtained
the sight at sunrise, &c., and the drinking of the water in which the
swords were washed.

'And, O Bhikkhus, the queen-consort of king Dîghîti of Kosala, when the
child in her womb had reached maturity, gave birth to a boy. They called

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

him Dîghâvu ("Longeval"). And ere long, O Bhikkhus, young Dîghâvu came
to the years of discretion.

7\. 'And king Dîghîti of Kosala, O Bhikkhus, thought: "This king
Brahmadatta of Kâsi has done much harm to us. By him we have been robbed
of our troops and vehicles, our realm, our treasuries and storehouses.
Should he find us out here, he will have us all three killed. What if I
were to cause young Dîghâvu to dwell outside the town."

Then king Dîghîti of Kosala, O Bhikkhus, caused young Dîghâvu to dwell
outside the town. And young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, dwelling outside the
town, ere long learnt all arts.'

8\. 'At that time, O Bhikkhus, the barber of king Dig-hid of Kosala
dwelt at the court of king Brahmadatta of Kâsi. Now, O Bhikkhus, this
barber of king Dîghîti of Kosala saw king Dîghîti of Kosala dwelling,
together with his consort, at Benares, at a certain place near the town,
in a potter's dwelling, in disguise, in the guise of a wandering
ascetic. When he had seen him, he went to the place where king
Brahmadatta of Kâsi was, and having approached him, he said to king
Brahmadatta of Kâsi: "King Dîghîti of Kosala, Your Majesty, dwells,
together with his consort, at Benares, at a certain place near the town,
in a potter's dwelling, in disguise, in the guise of a wandering
ascetic."

9\. Then, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kâsi gave order to his
attendants: "Well, my friends, bring king Dîghîti of Kosala and his
consort before me."

And those people, O Bhikkhus, accepted this order of king Brahmadatta of
Kâsi (by saying),

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Yes, Your
Majesty," and brought king Dîghîti of Kosala and his consort before him.

'Then, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kâsi gave order to his
attendants: "Well, my friends, bind king Dîghîti of Kosala and his
consort firmly with strong ropes, tie their arms to their backs, have
them close shaven, lead them around with loud beatings of drums from
road to road and from cross-way to cross-way, then lead them out of the
town by the southern gate, hew them in four pieces to the south of the
town, and throw the pieces away to the four quarters."

'And those people, O Bhikkhus, accepted this order of king Brahmadatta
of Kâsi (by saying), "Yes, Your Majesty," bound king Dîghîti of Kosala
and his consort firmly with strong ropes, tied their arms to their
backs, had them close shaven, and led them around with loud beatings of
drums from road to road and from cross-way to cross-way.

10\. 'Now, O Bhikkhus, young Dîghâvu thought "For a long time I have not
seen my father and mother. What if I were to go and see my father and
mother." And young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, entered Benares, and saw his
father and mother, bound firmly with strong ropes, their arms tied to
their backs, close shaven, and being led around with loud beating of
drums from "road to road and from cross-way to cross-way. When he saw
that, he went up to his father and mother.

'And king Dîghîti of Kosala, O Bhikkhus, saw young Dîghâvu coming from
afar; seeing young Dîghâvu he said to him: "Do not look long, my dear
Dîghâvu, and do not look short <span id="fr_562"></span>[1](#fn_552.md).
For not by

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

hatred, my dear Dîghâvu, is hatred appeased; by not-hatred, my dear
Dîghâvu, hatred is appeased."

11\. 'When he had spoken thus, O Bhikkhus, the people said to king
Dîghîti of Kosala: "This king Dîghîti of Kosala is mad and raves. What
has this Dîghâvu to do with him? Who is he to whom he says: Do not look
long, &c.?'" (Dîghîti replied): "I am not mad, my friends, nor do I
rave. 'He who is clever will understand it."

'And for the second time, &c. And for the third time, O Bhikkhus, king
Dîghîti of Kosala said to young- Dîghâvu, &c. And for the third time
said the people (&c., down to:) "He who is clever will understand it."

'Then those people, O Bhikkhus, having led king Dîghîti of Kosala and
his consort around from road to road and from cross-way to cross-way,
led them out of the town by the southern gate, hewed them in four pieces
to the south of the town, threw the pieces away to the four quarters,
stationed there a troop of soldiers, and went away.

12\. 'Then young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, went to Benares, got strong drink
there, and made those soldiers drink it. When they were drunk and had
fallen down, he gathered the pieces (of the two bodies), made a funeral
pile, put his father's and his mother's bodies on that pile, set it on
fire, and raising his clasped hands he three times circumambulated the
funeral pile.

'Now at that time, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kâsi had gone up on
to the terrace of his splendid palace. And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O
Bhikkhus, saw young Dîghâvu, who, raising his clasped 'hands, three
times circumambulated the

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

funeral pile. When he saw that, he thought: "Doubtless this man is a
relation or kinsman of king Dîghîti of Kosala. Alas for my misfortune,
that nobody will tell me (what this means)!"

13\. 'And young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, went to the forest. There he cried
and wept to his heart's content. Then he wiped his tears, entered the
town of Benares, went to the elephant stables near the royal palace, and
said to the elephant trainer: "I wish to learn your art, master."

'"Well, my good young man, learn it."

'And young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, arose in the night, at dawn's time, and
sung in the elephant stables in a beautiful voice, and played upon the
lute. And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, having risen in the
night, at dawn, heard that singing in a beautiful voice and that playing
upon the lute in the elephant stables. On hearing that he asked his
attendants: "Who is it, my friends, who has risen in the night, at
dawn's time, and has sung in the elephant stables in so beautiful a
voice, and has played upon the lute?"

14\. '(The attendants replied): "A young pupil, Your Majesty, of such
and such an elephant trainer, has risen in the night, at dawn, and has
sung it the elephant stables in so beautiful a voice, and has played
upon the lute."

'(The king said): "Well, my friends, bring that young man to me."

'Those people accepted, O Bhikkhus, that order of king Brahmadatta of
Kâsi (by saying), "Yes, Your Majesty," and brought young Dîghâvu to him.

'"Is it you, my good young man, who has risen in the night, &c.?"

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

"Yes, Your Majesty."

'"Well, my good young man, sing and play upon the lute (also before
me)."

'Young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, accepted this order of king Brahmadatta of
Kâsi (by saying), "Yes, Your Majesty," and in order to win (the king's)
favour he sung in a beautiful voice and played upon the lute.

'And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, said to young Dîghâvu: "Be my
attendant, my good young man."

'Young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, accepted this order of king Brahmadatta of
Kâsi (by saying), "Yes, Your Majesty." And young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus,
became (a servant) of king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, rising before him, lying
down after him, willingly obeying all his commands, agreeable in his
conduct, pleasing in his words. And ere long, O Bhikkhus, king
Brahmadatta of Kâsi gave to young Dîghâvu an intimate position of trust.

15\. 'And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, said to young Dîghâvu:
"Well, my young friend, put the horses to the chariot; we will go
a-hunting." And young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, accepted this order of king
Brahmadatta of Kâsi (by saying), "Yes, Your Majesty," put the horses to
the chariot, and said to king Brahmadatta of Kâsi: "The horses have been
put to your chariot, Your Majesty; you may do now as you think fit."

'And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, ascended the chariot, and
young Dîghâvu drove the chariot: and he drove the chariot in such a way
that the hosts (of the royal retinue) went one way, and the chariot went
another way.

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

And after a long drive, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kâsi said to
young Dîghâvu: "Well, my young friend, stop now the chariot. I am tired;
I would lie down."

Young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, accepted this order of king Brahmadatta of
Kâsi (by saying), "Yes, Your Majesty," stopped the chariot, and sat down
on the ground cross-legged. And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus,
lay down, laying his head in the lap of young Dîghâvu; and as he was
tired, he fell asleep in a moment.

16\. 'And young Dîghâvu thought, O Bhikkhus: "This king Brahmadatta of
Kâsi has done much harm to us. By him we have been robbed of our troops
and vehicles, our realm, our treasuries and storehouses. And he has
killed my father and mother. Now the time has come to me to satisfy my
hatred,"--(thinking thus) he unsheathed his sword. Then, O Bhikkhus,
young Dîghâvu thought: "My father said to me in the hour of his death:
'Do not look long, my dear Dîghâvu, and do not look short. For not by
hatred, my dear Dîghâvu, is hatred appeased; by not-hatred, my dear
Dîghâvu, hatred is appeased.' It would not become me to transgress my
father's word,"--(thinking thus) he put up his sword.

And for the second time . . . . and for the third time young Dîghâvu
thought, O Bhikkhus: "This king Brahmadatta of Kâsi has done much harm
to us" (&c., down to:)--(thinking thus) he put up his sword.

At that moment, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, frightened,
terrified, full of anguish, and alarmed, suddenly arose.

'And young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, said to king

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Brahmadatta of
Kâsi: "Why do you arise so suddenly, O king, frightened, terrified, full
of anguish and alarmed?"

'(The king replied): "I dreamt, my young friend, that young Dîghâvu, the
son of king Dîghîti of Kosala, came upon me with his sword; therefore
have I arisen so suddenly, frightened, terrified, full of anguish, and
alarmed."

17\. 'Then, O Bhikkhus, young Dîghâvu, stroking with his left hand the
head of king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, and with his right hand unsheathing
his sword, said to king Brahmadatta of Kâsi: "I am that young Dîghâvu, O
king, the son of king Dîghîti of Kosala. You have done much harm to us.
By you we have been robbed of our troops and vehicles, our realm, our
treasuries and storehouses. And you have killed my father and mother.
Now the time has come to me to satisfy my hatred."

'Then, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kâsi fell down before young
Dîghâvu, inclining his head to his feet, and said to young Dîghâvu:
"Grant me my life, my dear Dîghâvu! Grant me my life, my dear Dîghâvu!"

"How can I grant you your life, O king? It is you, O king, who should
grant me my life!"

'"Well, my dear Dîghâvu, then grant me my life, and I will grant you
your life."

Thus, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kâsi and young Dîghâvu granted
each other their lives and took each other's hands and swore an oath not
to do any harm to each other.

'And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, said to young Dîghâvu: "Well,
my dear Dîghâvu, put now the horses to the chariot; we will go."

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

'And young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, accepted this order of king Brahmadatta
of Kâsi (by saying), "Yes, Your Majesty," put the horses to the chariot,
and said to king Brahmadatta of Kâsi: "The horses have been put to your
chariot, Your Majesty; you may do now as you think fit."

'And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, ascended the chariot, and
young Dîghâvu drove the chariot; and he drove the chariot in such a way
that they soon reached again the hosts (of the royal retinue).

18\. 'And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, having entered Benares,
convoked his ministers and counsellors and said to them: "If you should
see, my good Sirs, young Dîghâvu, the son of king Dîghîti of Kosala,
what would you do to him?"

'Some (of the ministers) replied: "We would cut off his hands, Your
Majesty;" (others said): "We would cut off his feet"--"We would cut off
his hands and feet"--"We would cut off his ears"--"We would cut off his
nose"--"We would cut off his ears and his nose"--"We would cut off his
head."

'"This is young Dîghâvu, Sirs, the son of king Dîghîti of Kosala. It is
not permitted to do any-thing to him; he has granted me my life, and I
have granted him his life."

19\. 'And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, said to young Dîghâvu:
"Why did your father say to you in the hour of his death: 'Do not look
long, &c.'--what did your father mean by that?"

'What my father said, O king, in the hour of his death: 'Not
long'--(means): 'Let not your hatred last long;' this did my father mean
when he said in the hour of his death: 'Not long.' And

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

what my father said, O king, in the hour of his death: 'Not
short'--(means): 'Do not be hasty to fall out with your friends;' this
did my father mean when he said in the hour of his death: 'Not short.'
And what my father said, O king, in the hour of his death: 'For not by
hatred, my dear Dîghâvu, is hatred appeased; by not-hatred, my dear
Dîghâvu, is hatred appeased'--(means this): 'You have killed my father
and mother, O king. If I should deprive you therefore of life, O king,
then your partisans, O king, would deprive me of life; my partisans
again would deprive those of life. Thus by hatred that hatred would not
be appeased. But now, O king, you have granted me my life, and I, O
king, have granted you your life; thus by not-hatred hatred has been
appeased.' This did my father mean when he said in the hour of his
death: 'For not by hatred, &c.'"

20\. 'Then king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, thought: "O wonderful!
O marvellous! How clever is this young Dîghâvu, that he understands in
its full extent the meaning of what his father spoke so concisely,"--and
he gave him back his father's troops and vehicles, his realm, his
treasuries and storehouses, and he gave him his daughter,

'Now, O Bhikkhus, if such is the forbearance and mildness of kings who
wield the sceptre and bear the sword, so much more, O Bhikkhus, must you
so let your light shine before the world that you, having embraced the
religious life according to so well-taught a doctrine and a discipline,
are seen to be forbearing and mild.'

And for the third time <span id="fr_563"></span>[1](#fn_553.md) the Blessed
One thus

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

addressed those Bhikkhus: 'Enough, O Bhikkhus, no altercations, no
contentions, no disunion, no quarrels!'

And for the third time that Bhikkhu who adhered to the party who were
wrong, said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One, the king of
Truth, be patient! Lord, may the Blessed One quietly enjoy the bliss he
has obtained already in this life! The responsibility for these
altercations and contentions, for this disunion and quarrel will rest
with us alone.' And the Blessed One thought: 'Truly these fools are
infatuate; it is no easy task to administer instruction to them,'--and
he rose from his seat and went away.
