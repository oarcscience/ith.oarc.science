### 24.

1\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu kept Vassa <span
id="fr_451"></span>[2](#fn_443.md) alone. The people then gave him robes,
saying, 'We give them to the Sa*m*gha.'

Then that Bhikkhu thought: 'It has been laid down by the Blessed One
that the lowest number which can constitute a Sa*m*gha is four <span
id="fr_452"></span>[3](#fn_444.md). Now I am by myself, and these people
have given the robes, saying, "We give them to the Sa*m*gha." I had
better take these robes, which are the property of a Sa*m*gha, to
Sâvatthi.'

So that Bhikkhu did so, and told the matter to the Blessed One.

'These robes are your own, O Bhikkhu, until the Ka*th*ina ceremony shall
have been performed <span id="fr_453"></span>[4](#fn_445.md).'

2\. 'Now in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu keep Vassa alone, and the people
of the place give

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

him robes, intending them for the Sa*m*gha,--I prescribe, O Bhikkhus,
that those robes shall be his until the Ka*th*ina ceremony shall have
been performed.'

3\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu spent the rest of the year
(besides the rainy season) <span id="fr_454"></span>[1](#fn_446.md) alone.
The people there (&c., as before, in the first paragraph of 24. 1, down
to the end).

So that Bhikkhu did so, and told the matter to the Bhikkhus. They told
the matter to the Blessed One.

'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you are to divide such robes with the
Sa*m*gha (whether large or small in number) that may be present there.

4\. 'Now in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu spend the rest of the year
(besides the rainy season) alone, if and the people of the place give
him robes, intending them for the Sa*m*gha,--I allow, O Bhikkhus, that
that Bhikkhu should appropriate those robes to himself <span
id="fr_455"></span>[2](#fn_447.md), saying, "These robes are for me." If
another Bhikkhu should arrive before those robes have been appropriated
to that Bhikkhu, an equal share is to be given (to the in-coming
Bhikkhu). If while the robes are being divided by those Bhikkhus, and
before the lot has been cast, another Bhikkhu should arrive, an equal
share is to be given to him. If while the robes are being divided by
those Bhikkhus, and after the lot has been cast, another Bhikkhu

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

should arrive, an equal share need not, if they do not wish it <span
id="fr_456"></span>[1](#fn_448.md), be given to him.'

5\. Now at that time two Theras, who were brothers, the venerable
Isidâsa and the venerable Isibhatta, having spent the rainy season in
Sâvatthi, went to take up their abode in a certain village. The people
there, thinking, 'It is long since these Theras have arrived here,' made
gifts of both food and robes.

The Bhikkhus who resided there asked the Theras, saying, 'These robes,
Sirs, which are the property of the Sa*m*gha, have come to us through
the Theras' arrival <span id="fr_457"></span>[2](#fn_449.md). Will the
Theras accept a share?'

The Theras answered: 'As we understand the rule laid down by the Blessed
One, these robes belong to you alone until the K a Mina ceremony shall
have been performed <span id="fr_458"></span>[3](#fn_450.md).'

6\. Now at that time three Bhikkhus spent the rainy season at
Râ*g*agaha. The people there made gifts of robes, saying, 'We give them
to the Sa*m*gha.'

Then those Bhikkhus thought thus: 'It has been laid down by the Blessed
One that the smallest Sa*m*gha shall consist of four persons, and we are
only three, and these people have made gifts of robes, intending to give
them to the Sa*m*gha. What now ought we to do with them?'

Now at that time there were staying in Pâ*t*aliputta,

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

at the kukku*t*ârâma, a number of Theras--the venerable Nilavâsi, and
the venerable Sâ*n*avâsi <span
id="fr_459"></span>[1](sbe17092.htm#fn_451.md), and the venerable Gopaka,
and the venerable Bhagu, and the venerable Phalika-sandâna. And those
Bhikkhus went to Pâ*t*aliputta, and asked the Theras what they should
do.

The Theras answered: 'As we understand the rule laid down by the Blessed
One, these robes belong to you alone until the Ka*th*ina ceremony shall
have been performed.'

of the inducement offered to the givers by the presence of the Theras
here.'
