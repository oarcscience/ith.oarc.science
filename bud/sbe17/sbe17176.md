### 22.

1\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had committed two Sa*m*ghâdisesa
offences which he had concealed for two months. And it occurred to him,
'Lo! I have committed two Sa*m*ghâdisesa offences which I have concealed
for two months. Let me now ask the Sa*m*gha for a probation of two
months for one offence concealed for two months.' And he asked the
Sa*m*gha for a probation of two months for

one offence concealed for two months. And the Sa*m*gha imposed upon him
a probation (&c., as before, down to) for two months. Whilst he was
undergoing that probation, shame overcame him in that he thought, 'I
have committed, &c. . . . And it occurred to me, &c. . . . And I asked,
&c. . . . And the Sa*m*gha imposed . . . . And whilst I was undergoing .
. . . (&c., as before, down to) for two months.'

'Let me now ask the Sa*m*gha for a probation of two months for the other
offence concealed for two months.'

2\. He told the Bhikkhus \[all that had happened\]. They told this thing
to the Blessed One.

3\. 'Let then the Sa*m*gha, O Bhikkhus, impose upon that Bhikkhu a
probation of two months for that other offence concealed for two
months.'

\[Here follows the kammavâ*k*â as before.\]

'Then that Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, should undergo probation for two months
from that date <span id="fr_737"></span>[1](#fn_716.md).'
