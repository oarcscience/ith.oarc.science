1\. Now at that time, since there was a great company of the Bhikkhus
gathered together at Sâvatthi, those Bhikkhus who had been placed on
probation did not know how to carry out their probation correctly.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I prescribe to you, O Bhikkhus, to carry out your probation correctly.
Now thus, O Bhikkhus, ought you to postpone <span
id="fr_721"></span>[5](#fn_703.md) the probation. The Bhikkhu who has been
placed on probation is to go up to a single Bhikkhu, and arranging his
robe on one shoulder, and squatting down on his heels, and stretching
forth his hands with the palms together, he is to say: "I postpone my
probation." Then the probation is postponed. Or he is to say: "I
postpone

the duties (i.e. of a probationer)." Then also the probation is
postponed.'

2\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus who were at Sâvatthi went away hither
and thither, and the Bhikkhus who had been placed on probation were not
able to carry out their probation correctly <span
id="fr_722"></span>[1](#fn_704.md).

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I prescribe to you, O Bhikkhus, to take upon yourselves again the
probation (which had been postponed). Now thus, O Bhikkhus, ought you to
take it upon yourselves again. The Bhikkhu who has been placed under
probation is to go up to a single Bhikkhu, and arranging his robe on one
shoulder, and squatting down on his heels, and stretching forth his
hands with the palms together, he is to say: "I take my probation again
upon myself." Then the probation is resumed. Or he is to say: "I take
the duties (i.e. of a probationer) upon myself again." Then also is the
probation resumed.'

Here end the duties encumbent on a probationer.

should be impossible during the time immediately succeeding the
imposition of probation to fulfil all the thereto necessary duties, then
a Bhikkhu might postpone the fulfilment to some more convenient season.

Pâsâdikâ here says, Eva*m* vatta*m* samâdiyitvâ parivutta-parivâsassa
