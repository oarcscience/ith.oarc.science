### 34.

1\. Now at that time in Bhaddiya-nagara there dwelt a householder named
Me*nd*aka (the Goat), who was possessed of this miraculous power: When
he had bathed his head, and had had his granary swept out, he could sit
outside and fill the granary

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

by making showers of grain fall down from the sky. His wife was
possessed of this miraculous power: When she sat down beside a
pint <span id="fr_227"></span>[1](#fn_223.md) pot and vessel for curry and
sauce she could serve the serving men with food; and so long as she did
not get up, it was not exhausted. Their son was possessed of this
miraculous power: He could take a bag containing a thousand <span
id="fr_228"></span>[2](#fn_224.md), and give to each serving man six
months' wages; and so long as he held it in his hand, it was not
exhausted.

2\. Their daughter-in-law was possessed of this miraculous power.: When
she sat down beside a four-bushel <span id="fr_229"></span>[3](#fn_225.md)
basket she could give six months' rice to the serving men; and so long
as she did not get up, it was not exhausted. Their slave was possessed
of this miraculous power: When he ploughed with one plough-share seven
furrows were formed.

3, 4. Now the Mâgadha king Se*n*iya Bimbisâra heard: 'In Bhaddiya-nagara
in our kingdom there dwells, they say, a householder named Me*nd*aka,
who is possessed (&c., as in §§ 1, 2, down to the end).'

5\. Then the Mâgadha king Se*n*iya Bimbisâra said to a certain minister
who had charge of general affairs: 'They say, good Sir, that in
Bhaddiya-nagara (&c., as above). Go, good Sir, and find out about this.
When you have seen it, it shall be the same as if I myself had seen it.'

'Even so, Lord,' said that minister, in assent, to the Mâgadha king
Se*n*iya Bimbisâra, and he set out for Bhaddiya-nagara with his fourfold
host.

6\. And proceeding straight on he came to Bhaddiya-nagara, and to the
place where the householder

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

Me*nd*aka the was; householder Me*nd*aka a 'I have there, said to
received command from the king, "They say, good Sir (&c., as above, S
5)." Let us behold, O householder, your miraculous power.'

Then Me*nd*aka the householder bathed his head, and had his granary
swept out, and sat down outside it. And showers of grain fell down from
the sky and filled the granary.

'I have seen, O householder, your miraculous power. Let us see that of
your wife.'

7\. Then Me*nd*aka the householder gave command to his wife, 'Serve then
the fourfold host with food.'

And the wife of Me*nd*aka the householder took her seat beside a pint
pot and a vessel of sauces and curry, and served the fourfold host with
food; and until she rose up it was not exhausted.

'I have seen, O householder, the miraculous power of your wife. Let us
see that of your son.'

8\. Then Me*nd*aka the householder gave command to his son, 'Pay then,
my dear boy, six months' wages to the fourfold host.'

And the son of Me*nd*aka the householder took one bag containing a
thousand, and paid the four-fold army six months' wages. And so long as
he held it in his hand, it was not exhausted.

'I have seen, O householder, the miraculous power of your son. Let us
see that of your daughter-in-law.'

9\. Then Me*nd*aka the householder gave command to his daughter-in-law,
'Give, then, six months' rice to the fourfold host.'

And the daughter-in-law of Me*nd*aka the householder

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

sat down beside one four-bushel basket, and provided the fourfold host
with six months' rice. And so long as she did not get up, it was not
exhausted.

'I have seen, O householder, the miraculous power of your
daughter-in-law. Let us see that of your slave.'

'The miraculous power of my slave, Sir, must be seen in the field.'

'It is enough, O householder. I have seen the miraculous power of your
slave.'

Then that minister returned again to Râ*g*agaha with his fourfold host,
and went to the place where the Mâgadha king Se*n*iya Bimbisâra was, and
when he had come there he told the matter to the Mâgadha king Se*n*iya
Bimbisâra.

10\. Now the Blessed One, when he had remained at Vesâlî as long as he
thought fit, went on his way to Bhaddiya with a great company of
Bhikkhus, with one thousand two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus. And the
Blessed One wandering straight on arrived at Bhaddiya. And there the
Blessed One stayed in the *G*âtiyâvana.

11\. And Me*nd*aka the householder heard: 'Behold, that Sama*n*a Gotama,
of the Sakya clan, who left the Sakya tribe to adopt the religious life,
is now arrived at Bhaddiya and is staying in the *G*âtiyâvana. Now
regarding that venerable Gotama, such is the high reputation that has
been noised abroad that he is said to be a fully-enlightened one,
blessed, and worthy, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with
knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed, who guides men as a driver curbs a
bullock, a teacher of gods and men, a blessed Buddha. He by himself
thoroughly understands, and sees, as it

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

were face to face, this universe, the world with its Devas, and with its
Brahmas; and with its Mâras, and all creatures, Sama*n*as and
Brâhma*n*as, gods and men: and he then makes that knowledge known to
others. The truth doth he make known, both in the spirit and in the
letter: lovely in its origin, lovely in its progress, lovely in its
consummation. The higher life doth he proclaim, in all its purity and
all its perfectness. Blessed is the sight of Arahats like that.'

12\. Then Me*nd*aka the householder had a number of splendid carriages
made ready, and mounting one of them he set out from Bhaddiya with the
train of splendid carriages to visit the Blessed One.

And many Titthiyas saw Me*nd*aka the householder as he was coming from
afar; .and when-they had seen him, they said to Me*nd*aka the
householder:

'Whither, O householder, are you going?'

'I am going, Sirs, to visit the Blessed One, the Sama*n*a Gotama.'

'But why, O householder, do you, being a Kiriya-vâda, go out to visit
the Blessed One who is an Akiriya-vâda? For, O householder, the Sama*n*a
Gotama, who is an Akiriya-vâda, teaches Dhamma without the doctrine of
action <span id="fr_230"></span>[1](#fn_226.md), and in this Dhamma he
instructs his hearers.'

13\. Then thought Me*nd*aka the householder: 'For a certainty that
Blessed One must be an Arahat Buddha: since these Titthiyas are so
jealous of him.' And he went on to the place where the Blessed One was,
proceeding in the carriage as far

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

as the ground was passable for carriages, and then dismounting from the
carriage, and going on foot. And when he had come there, he bowed down
before the Blessed One, and took his seat on one side.

And when he was so seated the Blessed One preached (&c., as usual, for
instance, I, 8, 2; 3, down to:) 'taken his refuge in him.'

'May the Blessed One consent to take his meal, together with the
Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha, at my house to-morrow.'

The Blessed One consented by remaining silent.

14\. Then Me*nd*aka the householder when he saw that the Blessed One had
consented (&c., as usual, see VI, 18, 1, 2, down to:) sat down on the
seat prepared for him.

15\. Then the wife, and the son, and the daughter-in-law, and the slave
of Me*nd*aka the householder went to the place where the Blessed One
was: and when they had come there they bowed down before the Blessed One
and took their seats on one side.

And the Blessed One preached to them (&c., as in § 13, down to:) 'taken
their refuge in him.'

16\. Then Me*nd*aka the householder served the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha with the
Buddha at their head (&c., as usual, down to:) sat down on one side.

And when he was so seated Me*nd*aka the householder said to the Blessed
One: 'So long as the Blessed One shall stay at Bhaddiya, so long will I
provide the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha with the Buddha at their head with food
every day.'

Then the Blessed One gladdened (&c., as usual, down to:) the Blessed One
rose from his seat, and went away.

17\. Now when the Blessed One had remained

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

at Bhaddiya as long as he thought fit, he went on, without informing
Me*nd*aka the householder, to Aṅguttarâpa with a great company of
Bhikkhus, with one thousand two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus.

And Me*nd*aka the householder heard: 'The Blessed One, they say, has
gone on to Aṅguttarâpa with (&c., down to:) Bhikkhus.' And Me*nd*aka the
householder gave command to his slaves and servants: 'Load then, my men,
a quantity of salt and oil, and rice, and hard food, and come: and let
one thousand two hundred and fifty cow-keepers come with one thousand
two hundred and fifty cows. Wherever we find the Blessed One there will
we supply him with fresh milk.'

18\. And Me*nd*aka the householder came up with the Blessed One in a
desert place on the way. And Me*nd*aka the householder went up to the
place where the Blessed One was: and when he had come he stood on one
side. And so standing, Me*nd*aka the householder said to the Blessed
One: 'May the Blessed One consent to take his meal (&c., as usual, down
to:) 'The time has come, and the meal is ready.'

19\. And the Blessed One early in the morning (&c., down to:) sat down
on the seat prepared for him.

Then Me*nd*aka the householder gave command to those thousand two
hundred and fifty cow-keepers: 'Take then, my men, each of you a cow,
and wait each of you upon a. Bhikkhu, and provide him with fresh milk.'

And Me*nd*aka the householder waited upon the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha with the
Buddha at their head with his own hand, and satisfied them with sweet
food, hard and soft, and with fresh milk.

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

The Bhikkhus, fearing to offend, would not take the milk:

'Take it, Bhikkhus, and drink it.'

20\. And Me*nd*aka the householder, when he had waited with his own hand
upon the Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha with the Buddha at their head, and had
satisfied them with sweet food, hard and soft, and with fresh milk; and
when the Blessed One had finished his meal, and had washed his hands and
his bowl, took his seat on one side.

And, so sitting, Me*nd*aka the householder said to the Blessed One:
'There are desert ways, Lord, waterless and foodless, where it is not
easy to travel without supplies for the journey. It would be well if the
Blessed One were to allow the Bhikkhus to take supplies with them.'

Then the Blessed One gladdened (&c., as usual, down to:) rose from his
seat, and went away.

21\. And the Blessed One, in that connection, and on that account, after
having delivered a religious discourse, said to the Bhikkhus:

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the five products of the cow;--milk, curds,
ghee, buttermilk, and butter. There are, O Bhikkhus, desert ways,
waterless and foodless, where it is not easy to travel without supplies
for the journey. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to provide yourselves with
supplies for a journey;--rice for him who wants rice, beans for him who
wants beans <span id="fr_231"></span>[1](#fn_227.md), salt for him who
wants salt, molasses for him who wants molasses, oil for him who wants
oil, ghee for him who wants ghee. There are, O Bhikkhus, faithful and
converted men who deposit

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

gold with a kappiya-kâraka <span id="fr_232"></span>[1](#fn_228.md),
saying, "Provide whatever is allowable for this Bhikkhu." I allow you, O
Bhikkhus, to accept whatever is allowable. But I do not say by that, O
Bhikkhus, that you may, on any pretext whatsoever, accept or seek for
gold.'
