### 4.

'A Bhikkhu, after the Ka*th*ina ceremony has been held, takes a robe not
ready, and goes away. And when he has got beyond the boundary he thinks,
"I will have the robe made up here, and will never go back;" and he gets
the robe made up, &c. <span id="fr_312"></span>[3](#fn_307)'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_307"></span>[160:3](sbe17058.htm#fr_312) Six of the seven
cases specified in chap. 2 (with the exception of the first of the
seven) are repeated here in the same words, with the only difference
that instead of 'takes a robe' it is said here 'takes a robe not ready.'
The first case is necessarily omitted, because it is essential to that
case, that the Bhikkhu going away takes with him a robe ready for wear.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[160:4](sbe17058.htm#fr_313) 'The six cases in
which he takes a robe away.'
