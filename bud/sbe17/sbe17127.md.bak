1\. So the Bhikkhu-Sa*m*gha, with Sâriputta and Moggallâna at their
head, proceeded to the Ki*t*â Hill, and there carried out the
Pabbâ*g*aniyakamma against those Bhikkhus who were followers

of Assa*g*i and Punabbasu, to the intent that those Bhikkhus should no
longer dwell on the Ki*t*â Hill. And they, when subjected by the
Sa*m*gha to the Pabbâ*g*aniya-kamma, did not conduct themselves aright,
they did not become subdued, they did not seek for release, they did not
ask the Bhikkhus for forgiveness, they reviled them, they found fault
with them <span id="fr_657"></span>[1](#fn_643.md), saying that they were
offending by acting in partiality, in ill-feeling, in folly, and in
fear <span id="fr_658"></span>[2](#fn_644.md); and they not only departed
from the place, but also left the Order <span
id="fr_659"></span>[3](#fn_645.md).

Those Bhikkhus who were moderate were offended, murmured, and became
indignant, saying, 'How can those Bhikkhus who are followers of Assa*g*i
and Punabbasu, after having been subjected by the Sa*m*gha to the
Pabbâ*g*aniya-kamma, refuse to conduct themselves aright (&c., as
before, down to) leave the Order?' And those Bhikkhus told the matter to
the Blessed One.

Then the Blessed One on that occasion, and in that connection, convened
a meeting of the Bhikkhusa*m*gha, and asked the Bhikkhus:

'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, as they say, that those Bhikkhus who are
followers of Assa*g*i and Punabbasu, after having been subjected by the
Sa*m*gha to the Pabbâ*g*aniya-kamma, refuse (&c., as before, down to)
leave the Order.?'

'It is true, Lord!'

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

'How can those Bhikkhus who (&c., as before, down to) leave the Order?
This will not conduce, O Bhikkhus, either to the conversion of the
un-converted, or to the increase of the converted; but rather to the
unconverted being not converted, and to the turning back of those which
have been converted.' And when the Blessed One had rebuked those
Bhikkhus in various ways, and had delivered a religious discourse, he
addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

'Then, O Bhikkhus, let not the Sa*m*gha revoke the Pabbâ*g*aniya-kamma.
There are five things, O Bhikkhus (&c., as before, from chapter 6, § 2,
down to the end of chapter 7, reading Pabbâ*g*aniya for Ta*gg*aniya):

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here end the eighteen cases in which there ought to be a revocation (of
the Pabbâ*g*aniya-kamma).
