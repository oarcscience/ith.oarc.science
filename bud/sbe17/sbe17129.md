# IV.

#### THE PA*T*ISÂRANIYA-KAMMA (ACT OF RECONCILIATION).

### 18 <span id="fr_661"></span>[1](#fn_647.md).

1\. Now at that time the venerable Sudhamma was residing at
Ma*kkh*ikâsa*nd*a in dependence upon *K*itta the householder,
superintending <span id="fr_662"></span>[2](#fn_648.md) the new buildings
he erected <span id="fr_663"></span>[3](#fn_649.md), and being constantly
supplied by him with food. And whenever *K*itta the householder wished
to give an invitation to the Sa*m*gha, or to four or five Bhikkhus <span
id="fr_664"></span>[4](#fn_650.md), or to a single one, he used not to
invite them without making special mention of the venerable Sudhamma.

Now at that time a number of the Thera Bhikkhus, including the venerable
Sâriputta, and the venerable Mahâ Moggallâna, and the venerable Mahâ
Ka*kk*âna, and the venerable Mahâ Ko*tth*ita, and the venerable Mahâ
Kappina, and the venerable Mahâ *K*unda, and

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

the venerable Anuruddha, and the venerable Revata, and the venerable
Upâli, and the venerable Ânanda, and the venerable Râhula, as they were
journeying through the country of Kâsi, arrived at Ma*kkh*ikâsa*nd*a.
And *K*itta the householder heard the news that the Thera Bhikkhus had
arrived at Ma*kkh*ikâsa*nd*a.

Then *K*itta the householder went up to the place where the Thera
Bhikkhus were, and on arriving there, he saluted the Thera Bhikkhus, and
took his seat on one side. And when he was so seated the venerable
Sâriputta taught *K*itta the householder, and incited him, and roused
him, and gladdened him with religious discourse. And *K*itta the
householder, having been thus taught, and incited, and roused, and
gladdened with religious discourse, said to the Thera Bhikkhus, 'May the
venerable Theras consent to take their to-morrow's meal, as incoming
Bhikkhus, at my house.' And the Thera Bhikkhus signified, by silence,
their consent.

2\. Then perceiving that the Thera Bhikkhus had given their consent,
*K*itta the householder rose from his seat, and bowed down before the
Thera Bhikkhus, and keeping them on his right hand as he passed them,
went on to the place where the venerable Sudhamma was. And on arriving
there, he saluted the venerable Sudhamma, and stood by on one side. And
so standing, *K*itta the householder said to the venerable Sudhamma:
'May the venerable Sudhamma consent to take his to-morrow's meal at my
house with the Theras.'

But the venerable Sudhamma, thinking, 'Formerly indeed this *K*itta the
householder, whenever he wished to give an invitation to the Sa*m*gha,
or to

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

four or five Bhikkhus, or to a single one, used not to invite them
without making special mention of me; but now he has invited the Thera
Bhikkhus without regarding me. This *K*itta the householder is now
incensed against me, unfavourable to me, takes pleasure in me no
longer.' And so thinking he refused, saying, 'It is enough, O
householder.'

And a second time *K*itta the householder said to the venerable Sudhamma
(&c., as before, with the same result). And a third time (&c., as
before, with the same result).

Then *K*itta the householder, thinking, 'What can the venerable Sudhamma
do against me, whether he consents, or whether he does not consent,'
saluted the venerable Sudhamma, and keeping him on his right hand as he
passed him, departed thence.

3\. And at the end of the night *K*itta the householder made ready sweet
food, both hard and soft, for the Thera Bhikkhus. And the venerable
Sudhamma, thinking, 'I may as well go and see what *K*itta the
householder has made ready for the Thera Bhikkhus,' robed himself early
in the morning, and went, duly bowled and robed, to the place where
*K*itta the householder dwelt; and, on arriving there, he took his seat
on a mat spread out for him.

Then *K*itta the householder went up to the place where the venerable
Sudhamma was; and after he had come there, he saluted the venerable
Sudhamma, and took his seat on one side. And when he was so seated the
venerable Sudhamma addressed *K*itta the householder, and said: 'Though
this great store of sweet food, both hard and soft, has been made ready
by you, O householder, there is one thing yet wanting, that is to say,
tila seed cake.

'<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

Though then, Sir, there is so much treasure in the ward of the Buddhas,
yet there is but one thing of which the venerable Sudhamma makes
mention, and that is tila seed cake. Long ago, Sir, certain merchants of
Dakkhi*n*âpatha went, for the sake of their traffic, to the country of
the East, and thence they brought back a hen. Now, Sir, that hen made
acquaintance with a crow, and gave birth to a chicken. And, Sir,
whenever that chicken tried to utter the cry of a cock it gave vent to a
"caw," and whenever it tried to utter the cry of a crow, it gave vent to
a "cock-a-doodle-do <span id="fr_665"></span>[1](#fn_651.md)." Just even
so, Sir, though there is much treasure in the ward of the Buddhas,
when-ever the venerable Sudhamma speaks, the sound is "tila seed cake."'

4\. 'You are abusing me, householder. You are finding fault with me,
householder. This place, householder, is yours. I must go away from it,'
said the venerable Sudhamma.

'I do not intend, Sir, to abuse the venerable Sudhamma, nor to find
fault with him. Let, Sir, the venerable Sudhamma still dwell at
Ma*kkh*ikâsa*nd*a. Pleasant is this grove of plum trees, and I shall
take good care to, provide the venerable Sudhamma with those things a
recluse requires--to wit, with robes and food and lodging and medicine
when he is sick.'

And a second time the venerable Sudhamma said: You are abusing me (&c.,
as before, with the same reply). And a third time the venerable Sudhamma
said: 'You are abusing me (&c., as before, down to) I must go away from
it.'

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

'Whither then, Sir, will the venerable Sudhamma go?'

'I shall go to Sâvatthi, O householder, to visit the Blessed One.'

'Then, Sir, let the Blessed One know all, both what you yourself have
said, and what I have said. And I should not, Sir, be surprised if the
venerable Sudhamma were to return again even to Ma*kkh*ikâsa*nd*a.'

5\. So the venerable Sudhamma gathered together his sleeping mat, and
set out, with his bowl and his robe, for Sâvatthi. And he journeyed
straight on to Sâvatthi, to the *G*etavana, Anâthapi*nd*ika's Grove, to
the place where the Blessed One was; and on arriving there he bowed down
before the Blessed One, and took his seat on one side. And when he was
thus seated the venerable Sudhamma informed the Blessed One of all, both
that he himself had said, and that *K*itta the householder had said.

The Blessed Buddha rebuked him, saying, 'This was improper, O foolish
one, not according to rule, unsuitable, unworthy of a Sama*n*a, and
ought not to have been. done. How is it that you, O foolish one, could
put down <span id="fr_666"></span>[1](#fn_652.md) and could lower by your
censure <span id="fr_667"></span>[2](#fn_653.md) *K*itta the householder,
he being a man of faith, a believing disciple, and a donor, a provider,
and a supporter of the Sa*m*gha?' This will not conduce, O foolish one,
either to the conversion of the unconverted, or to the increase of the
converted; but rather to the unconverted not being converted, and to the
turning back of those who have been

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

converted.' And after he had rebuked him, and had delivered a religious
discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'Let therefore the
Sa*m*gha, O Bhikkhus, carry out the Pa*t*isâra*n*iya-kamma (Act of
Reconciliation) <span id="fr_668"></span>[1](#fn_654.md) against the
Bhikkhu Sudhamma, saying, "You are to ask and obtain pardon of *K*itta
the householder."'

6\. 'Now thus, O Bhikkhus, should it be carried out. In the first place
the Bhikkhu Sudhamma ought to be warned: when he has been warned, he
ought to be reminded (of the Rule in the Pâtimokkha against which he has
offended); when he has been reminded, he ought to be charged with the
offence; when he has been charged with the offence, some discreet and
able Bhikkhu ought to lay the matter before the Sa*m*gha, saying,

'"Let the venerable Sa*m*gha hear me. This Bhikkhu Sudhamma has put
down, and has lowered by censure *K*itta the householder, a man of
faith, a believing disciple, a donor, provider and supporter of the
Sa*m*gha. If the time is fit for the Sa*m*gha to do so, let the Sa*m*gha
carry out the Pa*t*isâra*n*iya-kamma against the Bhikkhu Sudhamma.

'"This is the motion (*ñ*atti).

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

'"Let the venerable Sa*m*gha hear me. This Bhikkhu (&c., as before, down
to) supporter of the Sa*m*gha. The Sa*m*gha hereby carries out the
Pa*t*isâra*n*iya-kamma against the Bhikkhu Sudhamma with the words, 'You
are to ask and obtain pardon of *K*itta the householder.' Whosoever of
the venerable ones approves of the carrying out of the
Pa*t*isâra*n*iya-kamma against Sudhamma the Bhikkhu, let him remain
silent. Whosoever approves not thereof, let him speak.

'"A second time I say the same thing. Let the venerable. Sa*m*gha (&c.,
as before). A third time I say the same thing. Let the venerable
Sa*m*gha (&c:, as before).

'"The Pa*t*isâra*n*iya-kamma has been carried out against the Bhikkhu
Sudhamma with the words, 'You are to ask and obtain pardon of *K*itta
the householder.' The Sa*m*gha approves the motion. Therefore is it
silent. Thus do I understand."'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_647"></span>[359:1](sbe17129.htm#fr_661.md) The whole of this
story of *K*itta and Sudhamma recurs in the Dhammapada commentary, pp.
262-264. There is no Rule in the Pâtimokkha by which giving offence to a
layman, the cause of the proceeding described in the following chapters,
is considered worthy of censure.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[359:2](sbe17129.htm#fr_662.md) Navakammiko, not
'newly appointed to an office,' as Dr. Rudolf Hoernle translates in the
Indian Antiquary, XI, 29, in dealing with one of the Bharhut
Inscriptions. See *G*âtaka I, 92, and below, V, 13, 3, VI, 5, 2, VI, 17,
1, X, 24, This duty of superintending a new building was even filled by
Bhikkhunîs; see the Bhikkhunî-vibhaṅga, Pârâ*g*ika I, where the details
of the duty are incidentally mentioned.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[359:3](sbe17129.htm#fr_663.md) Compare below,
*K*ullavagga VI, 5, 2, and *G*âtaka I, 92, 22.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[359:4](sbe17129.htm#fr_664.md) This clause, both
here and below, is omitted in the Sinhalese MS.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[362:1](sbe17129.htm#fr_665.md) Compare *G*âtaka
I, 432; II, 307.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[363:1](sbe17129.htm#fr_666.md) Compare
Dhammapada, p. 263, and *G*âtaka I, 191.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[363:2](sbe17129.htm#fr_667.md) Compare *G*âtaka
I, 191, 356, 359, and Sutta Nipâta, verse 905.

<span id="fn_654"></span>[364:1](sbe17129.htm#fr_668.md) Childers proposes
doubtingly to derive the word Pa*t*isâra*n*iya from the root smar; but
that that is impossible is probably sufficiently evident from the
meaning of the word, which is quite clear from the context of this, and
from the following chapters. Now at p. 530 of the Lalita Vistara the
common Pâli phrase sammodanîya*m* katha*m* sârâ*n*îya*m* vîtisâretvâ is
represented by the Sanskrit sammodanî*h* sa*m*ra*ñ*g.anî*h* kathâ*h*
k*ri*tvâ. It is by no means impossible that this parallel may offer the
true solution of the etymology of the Pâli words in question; (compare
Sârâga as equal to sa*m*râga, sâratta to sa*m*rakta, &c. &c.)
Pa*t*isâra*n*iya would then be equal to pratisa*m*ra*ñg*anîya. See
Senart, Mahâvagga, p. 599.
