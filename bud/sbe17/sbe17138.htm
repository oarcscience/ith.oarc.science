<p>1. So the Sa<I>m</I>gha carried out against <I>Kh</I>anna the Bhikkhu the Ukkhepaniya-kamma for not acknowledging a fault to the effect that he should not at or dwell together with the Sa<I>m</I>gha. And after he had been subjected by the Sa<I>m</I>gha to the Ukkhepaniya-kamma for not acknowledging his fault he went from that residence to another residence.

What now should I do?'</p>  
<p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'Then, O Bhikkhus, let the Sa<I>m</I>gha revoke the Ukkhepaniya-kamma for not acknowledging his fault carried out against <I>Kh</I>anna the Bhikkhu.</p>
