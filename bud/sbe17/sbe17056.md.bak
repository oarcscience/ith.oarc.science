**1**. 7. Now when, O Bhikkhus, is the Ka*th*ina (that is to say, the
privileges allowed after the Ka*th*ina ceremony) suspended?

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

'There are, O Bhikkhus, these eight grounds <span
id="fr_304"></span>[1](#fn_300.md) for the suspension of the Ka*th*ina
(privileges) <span id="fr_305"></span>[2](#fn_301.md)--the ground depending
on (the Bhikkhus) having gone away, on (his robe being ready) finished,
on his resolve (not to have it finished), on (his robe) having been
destroyed, on his having heard (of the general suspension of the
privileges of the whole Sa*m*gha), on the lapse of expectation (that a
special gift of a robe would be made to him), on his having gone beyond
the boundary (of the Sa*m*gha to whom the Ka*th*ina was given), on the
common suspension (of the Ka*th*ina privileges of the whole Sa*m*gha).

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

**2**. 1. 'A Bhikkhu, after the Ka*th*ina ceremony has been held <span
id="fr_306"></span>[1](#fn_302.md), takes a robe ready for wear, and goes
away, thinking, "I will come back."

'That Bhikkhu's Ka*th*ina privileges are suspended on the ground of his
having gone away.

'A Bhikkhu, after the Ka*th*ina ceremony has been held, takes a robe and
goes away. And when he had got beyond the boundary he thinks, "I will
have the robe made up here, and will never go back." And he gets the
robe made up.

'That Bhikkhu's Ka*th*ina privileges are suspended on the ground of his
having a robe ready for wear.

A Bhikkhu, after the Ka*th*ina ceremony has been held, takes a robe and
goes away. And when he has got beyond the boundary he thinks, "I will
neither have the robe made up, nor will I go back."

'That Bhikkhu's Ka*th*ina privileges are suspended on the ground of his
having so decided.

'A Bhikkhu, after the Ka*th*ina ceremony has been held, takes a robe and
goes away. And when he has got beyond the boundary he chinks, "I will
have the robe made up here, and will never go back." And he has the robe
made up. And as the robe is being made up for him, it is spoilt.

'That Bhikkhu's Ka*th*ina privileges are suspended on the ground of the
robe being so spoilt.

2\. 'A Bhikkhu, after the Ka*th*ina ceremony has been held, takes a robe
and goes away, thinking, "I will come back." When he has got beyond the
boundary he has that robe made up. When his robe has thus been made up
he bears the news, "The Ka*th*ina, they say, has been suspended in that
district <span id="fr_307"></span>[1](#fn_302.md)."

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

''That Bhikkhu's Ka*th*ina privileges are suspended on the ground of his
having heard that news.

A Bhikkhu, after the Ka*th*ina ceremony has been held, takes a robe and
goes away, thinking, "I will come back." And when he has got beyond the
boundary he has that robe made up. And then, after it has been made up,
he postpones his return until the (general) suspension of privileges has
taken place.

'That Bhikkhu's Ka*th*ina privileges are suspended on the ground of his
being beyond the boundary.

'A Bhikkhu, after the Ka*th*ina ceremony has been held, takes a robe and
goes away, thinking, "I will come back." And when he has got beyond the
boundary he has that robe made up. And then, when it has been made up,
he postpones his return until the very moment when the (general)
suspension of privileges takes place <span

'That Bhikkhu's Ka*th*ina privileges are suspended on the ground of the
common suspension (of the privileges of the whole Sa*m*gha).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_299"></span>[156:4](sbe17056.htm#fr_303.md) The new chapter
should have begun here, and not with the next section as printed in the
text.

<span id="fn_300"></span>[157:1](sbe17056.htm#fr_304.md) Mâtikâ ’ti mâtaro
*g*anettiyo ’ti attho(B.). So also in VIII, 14.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[157:2](sbe17056.htm#fr_305.md) The discussion of
these eight grounds of the suspension of the five Ka*th*ina privileges
is closely connected with the description in the 13th chapter of the two
so-called Palibodhas. Palibodha seems to mean the continued existence of
a claim on the Bhikkhu's side to a share in the distribution of the
Ka*th*ina. Two conditions are necessary to the validity of this claim;
the first touching the Bhikkhu's domicile (âvâsa), the second the state
of his wardrobe (*k*îvara). He must remain within the boundary (sîmâ) of
the Sa*m*gha to whom the Ka*th*ina has been given; or if he has left it,
then he must have the intention of returning, the animus revertendi. And
secondly, he must be in actual want of robes. If either of these
conditions fail, then the Bhikkhu is apalibodha in respect of the âvâsa
or the *k*îvara respectively. If he is apalibodha in both respects, then
there follows the suspension of the Ka*th*ina privileges, the
ka*th*in-uddhâra, or ka*th*in-ubbhâra, so far as he is concerned.

So the eight grounds of the suspension of the privileges referred to in
our present section (chap. 1. 7) either refer to the Bhikkhu's domicile
or to the state of his robes, or to ways in which his case falls within
the general suspension of privileges of the whole Sa*m*gha, Each of the
eight cases is explained in detail in the following sections, except the
sixth ground, which is specially treated of afterwards in chapters 8 and
9. See the note on the title at the end of this chapter, and compare
further our note on the first Nissaggiya Pâ*k*ittiya.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[158:1](sbe17056.htm#fr_307.md) Literally, 'whose
Ka*th*ina has been spread out.'

<span id="fn_303"></span>[159:1](sbe17056.htm#fr_308.md) In the table of
contents (b. 266) sambhu*n*âti is replaced by sambhoti.
Abhisambhu*n*eyya*m* occurs in Burnouf's 'Lotus,' &c., p. 313.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[159:2](sbe17056.htm#fr_309.md) That is, 'the
seven cases in which he takes a robe away.' The eighth case is explained
below in chapters 8, 9.
