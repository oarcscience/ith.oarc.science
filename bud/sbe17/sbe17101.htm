<p>1. At that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus performed official acts in the following ways: they performed unlawful acts before an incomplete congregation (&amp;c., as in chap. 2, &sect; 1, down to:) they performed seemingly lawful acts before a complete congregation; they performed acts without a <I>&ntilde;</I>atti&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_501"></A><A HREF="#fn_493"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and with the proclamation (of the kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_502"></A><A HREF="#fn_493"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>) they performed acts without a proclamation (of the kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;) and with the <I>&ntilde;</I>atti; they performed acts without a <I>&ntilde;</I>atti and without a proclamation (of the kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;); they performed acts contrary to the Dhamma; they performed acts contrary to the Vinaya; they performed acts contrary to the doctrine of the Teacher; and they performed acts against which (the Bhikkhus present) protested, which were unlawful, objectionable, and invalid.</p>  
<p>Those Bhikkhus who were moderate, were annoyed,</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> &amp;c. These Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'Is it true, as they say, O Bhikkhus, that the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, &amp;c.?'</p>  
<p>It is true, Lord, &amp;c.'</p>  
<p>Having thus rebuked them and delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus:</p>  
<p>2. 'If an official act, O Bhikkhus, is performed unlawfully by an incomplete congregation, it is no real act and ought not to be performed (&amp;c.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_503"></A><A HREF="#fn_494"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, down to:). If an official act, O Bhikkhus, is performed against which (the Bhikkhus present) protest, which is unlawful, objectionable, and invalid, this is no real act and ought not to be performed.</p>  
<p>3. 'There are, O Bhikkhus, six kinds of official acts (which a Sa<I>m</I>gha can perform): an unlawful act, an act performed by an incomplete congregation, an act performed by a complete congregation, a seemingly lawful act performed by an incomplete congregation, a seemingly lawful act performed by a complete congregation, a lawful act performed by a complete congregation.</p>  
<p>'And which, O Bhikkhus, is an unlawful act? If one performs, O Bhikkhus, a <I>&ntilde;</I>attidutiya act&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_504"></A><A HREF="#fn_495"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> with one <I>&ntilde;</I>atti, and does not proclaim a kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;, such an act is unlawful. If one performs, O Bhikkhus, a <I>&ntilde;</I>attidutiya act with two <I>&ntilde;</I>atti and does not proclaim a kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc; . . . . with one kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc; and does not propose a <I>&ntilde;</I>atti . . . . with two</p>

<p>kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;s and does not propose a <I>&ntilde;</I>atti, such an act is unlawful.</p>  
<p>4. 'If one performs, O Bhikkhus, a <I>&ntilde;</I>atti<I>k</I>atuttha act with one <I>&ntilde;</I>atti and does not proclaim a kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;, such an act is unlawful. If one performs, O Bhikkhus, a &ntilde;atti<I>k</I>atuttha act with two (. . three, . . . . four) <I>&ntilde;</I>attis and does not proclaim a kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;, such an act is unlawful. If one performs, O Bhikkhus, a <I>&ntilde;</I>atti<I>k</I>atuttha act with one kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc; ( . . . . with two, . . . . three, . . . . four kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;s) and does not propose a <I>&ntilde;</I>atti, such an act is unlawful. Such acts, O Bhikkhus, are called unlawful acts.</p>  
<p>5. 'And which, O Bhikkhus, is an act of an incomplete congregation?</p>  
<p>'If, O Bhikkhus, at a <I>&ntilde;</I>attidutiya act not all Bhikkhus, as many as are entitled to vote, are present, if the <I>kh</I>anda&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_505"></A><A HREF="#fn_496"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of those who have to declare their <I>kh</I>anda has not been conveyed (to the assembly), and if the Bhikkhus present protest, such an act is performed by an incomplete congregation.</p>
