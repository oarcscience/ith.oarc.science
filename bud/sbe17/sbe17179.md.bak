1\. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu commit two Sa*m*ghâdisesa offences
which he conceals for two months. And it occurs to him (&c., as in last
chapter). . . . And he asks . . . . And the Sa*m*gha imposes . . . . And
whilst he is undergoing that probation, shame (&c.) overcomes him, &c. .
. . And he asks the Sa*m*gha for a probation of a further month for
those two Sa*m*ghâdisesa offences concealed for two months. And the
Sa*m*gha imposes upon him a further probation, &c. . . . Then, O

probation of one month for those two Sa*m*ghâdisesa offences concealed
for two months <span id="fr_743"></span>[1](#fn_722.md).

2, 3. 'Now in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu have committed two
Sa*m*ghâdisesa offences, which he conceals for two months. And of one
month he is aware, but of the other month he is not aware . . . . one
month he recollects, but the other month he does not recollect . . . .
one month he wittingly conceals, but the other month he unwittingly
conceals.'

\[This chapter is word for word the same as chapter 23, reading 'month'
for 'offence.'\]
