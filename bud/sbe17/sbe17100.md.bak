### 2.

1\. At that time the Bhikkhus of *K*ampâ performed official acts in the
following ways: they performed unlawful acts before an incomplete
congregation; they performed unlawful acts before a complete
congregation; they performed lawful acts before an incomplete
congregation; they performed seemingly lawful acts before an incomplete
congregation; they performed seemingly lawful acts before a complete
congregation; a single Bhikkhu pronounced expulsion against a single
one; a single Bhikkhu pronounced expulsion against two; a single Bhikkhu

pronounced expulsion against a number of Bhikkhus; a single Bhikkhu
pronounced expulsion against a Sa*m*gha; two Bhikkhus pronounced
expulsion against a single one . . . . against two . . . . against a
number of Bhikkhus . . . . against a Sa*m*gha; a number of Bhikkhus
pronounced expulsion against a single one . . . . against two . . . .
against another number . . . . against a Sa*m*gha; a Sa*m*gha pronounced
expulsion against another Sa*m*gha <span id="fr_498"></span>[1](#fn_490.md)

2\. Those Bhikkhus who were moderate, were annoyed, murmured, and became
angry: 'How can the Bhikkhus of *K*ampâ perform official acts in the
following ways: perform unlawful acts before an incomplete congregation
(&c., down to:) how can a Sa*m*gha pronounce expulsion against another
Sa*m*gha?'

These Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.

'Is it true, as they say, O Bhikkhus, that the Bhikkhus of *K*ampâ
perform official acts in the following ways, &c.?'

'It is true, Lord.'

Then the blessed Buddha rebuked those Bhikkhus: 'It is improper, O
Bhikkhus, what these foolish persons are doing; it is unbecoming,
indecent, unworthy of Sama*n*as, unallowable, and to be avoided. How can
these foolish persons, O Bhikkhus, perform official acts in the
following ways, &c. This will not do, O Bhikkhus, for converting the
unconverted.' Having thus rebuked them and delivered a religious
discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus:

3\. 'If an official act, O Bhikkhus, is performed

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

unlawfully by an incomplete congregation, it is no real act <span
id="fr_499"></span>[1](#fn_491.md) and ought not to be performed. An
official act performed unlawfully by a complete congregation is no real
act and ought not to be performed (&c., as in § 1, down to:). A
seemingly lawful act performed before a complete congregation is no real
act and ought not to be performed. In case a single Bhikkhu pronounces
expulsion against a single one,--this is no real act and ought not to be
performed (&c., down to:). In case a Sa*m*gha pronounces expulsion
against another Sa*m*gha,--this is no real act and ought not to be
performed.

4\. 'There are, O Bhikkhus, four kinds of official acts (which a
Sa*m*gha can perform); an unlawful act performed by an incomplete
congregation, an unlawful act performed by a complete congregation, a
lawful act performed by an incomplete congregation, and a lawful act
performed by a complete congregation.

'If, O Bhikkhus, an act is unlawful and performed by an incomplete
congregation--such an act, O Bhikkhus, is objectionable and invalid on
account of its unlawfulness and of the incompleteness (of the
congregation). Such an act, O Bhikkhus, ought not to be performed, nor
is such an act allowed by me.

'If, O Bhikkhus, an act is unlawful and performed by a complete
congregation--such an act, O Bhikkhus, is objectionable and invalid on
account of its unlawfulness. Such an act, &c.

'If, O Bhikkhus, an act is lawful and performed by an incomplete
congregation--such an act, O Bhikkhus, is objectionable and invalid on
account of

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

the incompleteness (of the congregation). Such an act, &c.

'If, O Bhikkhus, an act is lawful and performed by a complete
congregation--such an act, O Bhikkhus, is unobjectionable and valid on
account of its lawfulness and of the completeness (of the congregation).
Such an act, O Bhikkhus, ought to be performed, and such an act is
allowed by me.

'Therefore, O Bhikkhus, you ought to train yourselves thus: "Lawful acts
which are performed by complete congregations--such acts will we
perform <span id="fr_500"></span>[1](#fn_492.md)."'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_490"></span>[262:1](sbe17100.htm#fr_498.md) The cases of a
Sa*m*gha's expelling a single Bhikkhu, or two Bhikkhus, or a number of
Bhikkhus, are omitted, because such proceedings are lawful.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[263:1](sbe17100.htm#fr_499.md) I.e. it is null
and void.

<span id="fn_492"></span>[264:1](sbe17100.htm#fr_500.md) A similar
injunction is found at the close of chapter 1I, 14.
