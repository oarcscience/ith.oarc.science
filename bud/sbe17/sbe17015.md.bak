# SIXTH KHANDHAKA.

#### (ON MEDICAMENTS.)

### 1.

1\. At that time the Blessed One dwelt at Sâvatthi, in the *G*etavana,
the park of Anâtha-pi*nd*ika. And at that time Bhikkhus, attacked by the
sickness of the hot season <span id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_81.md), threw up
the rice-milk they had drunk, and the food they had eaten. And thereby
they became lean, rough, ill-favoured, yellow and ever yellower, and the
veins stood out on their limbs <span id="fr_83"></span>[2](#fn_82.md).

And the Blessed One saw those Bhikkhus thus lean, rough, ill-favoured,
yellow and ever yellower, and with the veins standing out on their
limbs. And on seeing it, he asked the venerable Ânanda:

'How is it, Ânanda, that the Bhikkhus are become now so lean, rough,
&c.?'

'At this time, Lord, the Bhikkhus are attacked with the disease of the
hot season; and they throw up the rice-milk they have drunk, and the
food they have eaten. Thence is it that they are become lean, rough,
ill-favoured, yellow and ever yellower, and that the veins stand out on
their limbs.'

2\. Then there occurred to the mind of the

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Blessed One, when
meditating alone, this consideration: 'At this time the Bhikkhus (&c.,
down to:) on their limbs. What medicaments shall I now prescribe for the
Bhikkhus, as may be authorised as common medicine, and may be diffused
through the body, though it be not regarded as ordinary (material)
food?' And the Blessed One thought: 'These five medicaments--that is to
say, ghee, butter, oil, honey, molasses--are such medicaments. Let me
then prescribe them as medicines which the Bhikkhus may accept at the
right time, and use at the right time.'

3\. And in the evening, when the Blessed One had arisen from his
meditation, having delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the
Bhikkhus in that connection, saying,

'When I was meditating alone, O Bhikkhus, then occurred to my mind this
consideration: "At this time (&c., as in § 2, down to:) material food."
Then I thought: "These five (&c., as in § 2, down to:) at the right
time." I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, these five things as medicine to be
accepted at the right time, and to be used at the right time.'

4\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus accepted those five things at the
right time, and used them at the right time. And foods which though
rough, were ordinary foods, they could not digest <span
id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_83.md), much less greasy foods <span
id="fr_85"></span>[2](#fn_84.md). Then they--attacked both by the
hot-season disease, and by this want of appetite <span
id="fr_86"></span>[3](#fn_85.md)--became by both at once still more lean,
rough,

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

ill-favoured, yellow and ever yellower, and with the veins standing out
on their limbs.

And the 'Blessed One saw the Bhikkhus thus still more lean, &c. And when
he saw it, he asked the venerable Ânanda: 'How is it, Ânanda, that the
Bhikkhus are become now still more lean, &c.?'

5\. 'At present, Lord, these Bhikkhus, who use the five medicaments only
at the right time, cannot digest foods which, though ordinary, are
rough, much less greasy foods. Then they, attacked (&c., as in § 4, down
to:) standing out on their limbs.'

Then the Blessed One on that occasion, having delivered a religious
discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'I permit you, O Bhikkhus,
not only to receive those five medicaments, but to use them both at the
right time, and at other times.'
