### 3.

1\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus who were sick had need of roots for
medicine.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of roots as medicine--turmeric, ginger,
orris root, white orris root, ativisa, black hellebore, usîra root,
bhaddamuttaka, and whatsoever other roots are used for medicine, and
impart an appetising flavour to foods, either hard or soft, which the
sick Bhikkhus could not otherwise eat <span
id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_86.md). They may be received, and stored up your
life long; and, if there be necessity, they may be eaten. If eaten
without necessity, (the Bhikkhu who uses them) is guilty of a dukka*t*a
offence.'

2\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus who were sick

had need for medicine of different sorts of flour made from roots.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.
