### 37.

1\. Now the Blessed One, when he had stayed at Kusinârâ as long as he
thought fit, went on, on his pilgrimage to Âtumâ, with a great company
of the Bhikkhus, with two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus. And at that time
there was dwelling at Âtumâ a certain man, who had entered the Order in
his old age, and who had previously been a barber <span
id="fr_256"></span>[1](#fn_252.md). He had two sons, handsome <span
id="fr_257"></span>[2](#fn_253.md), skilled in discourse <span
id="fr_258"></span>[3](#fn_254.md), able, fully educated in all the arts
which belonged to the barbers' craft handed down to them by their
teachers <span id="fr_259"></span>[4](#fn_255.md).

2\. Now this dotard <span id="fr_260"></span>[5](#fn_256.md) heard the
news: 'The Blessed One, they say, is coming to Âtumâ with

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

a great company of the Bhikkhus, with two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus.'
Then that dotard spake thus to his sons: 'They say the Blessed One is
coming, my children <span id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_257.md), to Âtumâ with
a great company of Bhikkhus, with two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus. Go,
therefore, my children, and taking your barbers' lad <span
id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_258.md) with you, collect in quart pots from
house to house, salt, and oil, and rice, and meal. And we will prepare
congey for the Blessed One when he has arrived.'

3\. Very good, Father, said they, and (did so). And when people saw
those young men, of pleasing appearance, and skilful in discourse, so
acting, then even those who were not willing to be led into joining in
the act were led to join in it; and being so led, they gave abundantly.
So the young men collected a great quantity of salt, and oil; and rice,
and meal.

4\. And the Blessed One in due course arrived in his journey at Âtumâ;
and there at Âtumâ the Blessed One stayed at the Threshing floor. And
that dotard, when the night was far spent, had much congey made ready,
and offered it to the Blessed One, saying, 'May the Blessed One accept
the congey at my hands.'

Now the Tathâgatas sometimes ask about what they know; sometimes they do
not ask about what they know. They understand the right time when to
ask, and they understand the right time when not to ask. The Tathâgatas
put questions full of

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

sense, not void of sense: to what is void of sense, the bridge is pulled
down for the Tathâgatas. For two purposes the blessed Buddhas put
questions to the Bhikkhus--when they intend to preach the Truth, and
when they intend to institute a rule of conduct to their disciples <span
id="fr_263"></span>[1](#fn_259.md). And the Blessed One spake thus to that
dotard, 'Whence, O Bhikkhu, is this congey?'

Then that dotard informed the Blessed One of the whole matter.

5\. The Blessed Buddha rebuked him, saying, 'This is improper, O foolish
one, not according to rule, unsuitable, unworthy of a Sama*n*a,
unbecoming, and ought not to be done. How can you, O foolish one, having
gone forth (from the world into the Order), instigate others to do what
is unlawful. This will not conduce, O foolish one, to the conversion of
the unconverted.'

And when he had rebuked him, and had delivered a religious discourse, he
addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'One who has gone forth ought not, O
Bhikkhus, to instigate others to an unlawful act <span
id="fr_264"></span>[2](#fn_260.md). Whosoever does so, is guilty of a
dukka*t*a. And one, O Bhikkhus, who has formerly been a barber is not to
keep a barber's boy. Whosoever does so, is guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_252"></span>[140:1](sbe17051.htm#fr_256.md) This man is
identified by the tradition with the Subhadda mentioned in the accounts
of the Great Decease, and of the First Council. See Rh. D.'s note on
Mahâ-parinibbâna Sutta VI, 40.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[140:2](sbe17051.htm#fr_257.md) Buddhaghosa
understands this word, which he reads differently, as meaning
'sweet-voiced.' Ma*ñk*ukâ (sic) ti madhura-va*k*anâ. We follow the
ordinary meaning of ma*ñg*u.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[140:3](sbe17051.htm#fr_258.md) Here again
Buddhaghosa gives a technical meaning to the word, unsupported by the
derivation. He says, Pa*t*ibhâneyyakâ ti sake sippe
pa*t*ibhâna-sampannâ. This agrees with Childers's rendering (sub voce)
of *G*âtaka I, 60; but compare Sigâlovâdâ Sutta, ed. Grimblot, p. 309.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[140:4](sbe17051.htm#fr_259.md) On the idiomatic
phrase saka*m* â*k*ariyaka*m*, compare Mahâparinibbâna Sutta III, 7, 8
(text ed. Childers, pp. 24 and following).

<span id="fn_256"></span>[140:5](sbe17051.htm#fr_260.md) Literally, 'this
man who had gone forth (from the household state into the homeless life
of the Order) in his old age.' But it is impossible to repeat this long
phrase throughout the narrative as is done in the Pâli, where the
meaning of the phrase is 'expressed by one compound. As the Pâli word
vuddha-pabba*g*ito connotes contempt, and even censure (men entering the
Order in their old age being often represented as incapable of
appreciating even the simplest principles of the 'doctrine and
discipline'), the use of the word 'dotard' in our translation seems to
retain the spirit of the Pâli epithet, while avoiding the inconvenient
length of a literal version.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[141:1](sbe17051.htm#fr_261.md) Tâta, not tâtâ. It
will be seen that Childers is wrong in supposing that the plural form is
always used when more than one person is addressed.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[141:2](sbe17051.htm#fr_262.md) Khura-bha*nd*a*m*;
not 'shaving materials;' compare hatthi-bha*nd*o and assa-bha*nd*o at
Mahâvagga I, 61, and below, § 5.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[142:1](sbe17051.htm#fr_263.md) See Mahâvagga I,
31, 5.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[142:2](sbe17051.htm#fr_264.md) Unlawful, because
one Bhikkhu may not beg for others, and it is unlawful for those others
to accept things thus procured.
