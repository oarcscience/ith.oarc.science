offences, definite <span id="fr_751"></span>[1](#fn_729.md), but not

probation.

2\. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, whilst a Bhikkhu is undergoing probation, he
commit numerous Sa*m*ghâdisesa offences, definite, and concealed, that
Bhikkhu is to be thrown back to the commencement of his probation; and
an inclusive probation is to be imposed upon him according to the

concealed.

'In case, O Bhikkhus, whilst a Bhikkhu is undergoing probation, he
commit numerous Sa*m*ghâdisesa offences, grievous, and some of them
concealed, some of them not concealed, that Bhikkhu must (as in the last

<span id="fn_729"></span>[421:1](sbe17181.htm#fr_751.md) Parimâ*n*â, the
meaning of which is open to much doubt. The Samanta Pâsâdikâ merely
says, Antarâ sambahulâ âpattiyo âpa*gg*ati parimâ*n*â pa*t*i*kkh*annâyo
ti âdisu âpatti-pari*kkh*edavase parimâ*n*âyo *k*’ eva
appa*t*i*kkh*annâyo *k*â ’ti attho. The only conclusion to be drawn from
this is that the word is acc. fem. plur., and not an adverb. Compare
chap. 33, below.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[421:2](sbe17181.htm#fr_752.md) The text has a
full paragraph for each of these cases.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[422:1](sbe17181.htm#fr_753.md) This chapter is
repeated below, chap. 33, for the cases in which a new ordination has
followed after the offences have been committed.
