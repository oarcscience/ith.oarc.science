### 24.

1\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu committed two Sa*m*ghâdisesa
offences which he concealed for two months. And it occurred to him, Lo!
I have committed, &c. . . . for two months. Let me now ask the Sa*m*gha
for a probation of one month for &c. . . .' He asked the Sa*m*gha for a
probation of one month for &c. . . . The Sa*m*gha imposed upon him a
probation of one month for &c. . . . Whilst he was undergoing that
probation, shame (for the way

in which he had acted) overcame him. 'Let me now ask the Sa*m*gha for a
(further) probation of one month for the two Sa*m*ghâdisesa offences
concealed for two months.'

2\. He told the Bhikkhus \[all that had happened, in the words of § 1,
and asked them\], 'What now shall I do?'

They told this thing to the Blessed One.,

3\. 'Let then the Sa*m*gha, O Bhikkhus, impose upon that Bhikkhu a
probation for a further month for those two Sa*m*ghâdisesa offences
concealed for two months.'

\[Here follows the kammavâ*k*â in the form given in chapter 1, §§ 2,
3.\]

'Thus that Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, should undergo probation for two months
from that date <span id="fr_742"></span>[1](#fn_721.md).'
