<p>1. And the Blessed One, having dwelt at P&acirc;rileyyaka as long as he thought fit, went forth to S&acirc;vatthi. Wandering from place to place he came to S&acirc;vatthi. There the Blessed One dwelt at S&acirc;vatthi, in the <I>G</I>etavana, the garden of An&acirc;tha-pi<I>n</I><I>d</I>ika. And the lay-devotees of Kosamb&icirc; thought: 'These venerable Bhikkhus of Kosamb&icirc; have brought much misfortune to us; worried&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_577"></A><A HREF="#fn_566"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> by them the Blessed One is gone. Well, let us neither salute the venerable Bhikkhus of Kosamb&icirc;, nor rise from our seats before them, nor raise our hands before them, nor perform the proper duties towards them, nor honour and esteem and revere and sup-port them, nor give them food when they come on their walks for alms; thus, when they are not honoured, esteemed, revered, supported, and hospitably received by us, they will go away, or return to the world, or propitiate the Blessed One.'</p>  
<p>2. Thus the lay-devotees of Kosamb&icirc; did not salute any more the Bhikkhus of Kosamb&icirc;, nor did they rise from their seats before. them (&amp;c., down to:) nor gave them food when they came on their walks for alms.</p>  
<p>Then the Bhikkhus of Kosamb&icirc;, when they were no more honoured (&amp;c., down to:) and hospitably</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_315"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 315</FONT></A></p>  
<p>received by the lay-devotees of Kosamb&icirc;, said to each other: 'Well, friends, let us go to S&acirc;vatthi and let us settle there that question before the Blessed One.' And the Bhikkhus of Kosamb&icirc; put their resting-places in order, took up their alms-bowls and their robes, and went forth to S&acirc;vatthi.</p>  
<p>3. And the venerable S&acirc;riputta heard: Those litigious, contentious, quarrelsome, disputatious Bhikkhus of Kosamb&icirc;, the constant raisers of questions before the Sa<I>m</I>gha, are coming to S&acirc;vatthi.' And the venerable S&acirc;riputta went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him. Sitting near him the venerable S&acirc;riputta said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, those litigious, contentious (&amp;c., down to:) are coming to S&acirc;vatthi. How am I to behave, Lord, towards those Bhikkhus?'</p>  
<p>'Well, S&acirc;riputta, you must side with those who are right according to the Dhamma.'</p>  
<p>'But how shall I discern, Lord, what is right and what is wrong?'</p>  
<p>4. 'There are eighteen things, S&acirc;riputta, by which you may conclude that a Bhikkhu is wrong according to the Dhamma. In case, S&acirc;riputta, a Bhikkhu declares what is not Dhamma to be Dhamma, or declares what is Dhamma not to be Dhamma, or declares what is not Vinaya to be Vinaya, or declares what is Vinaya not to be Vinaya, or declares what has not been taught and spoken by the Tath&acirc;gata to have been taught and spoken by the Tath&acirc;gata, or declares something taught and spoken by the Tath&acirc;gata not to have been taught and spoken by the Tath&acirc;gata, or declares what has not been</p>

<p>6. And the venerable Mah&acirc;moggall&acirc;na heard (&amp;c., as in &sect; 3--5)--and the venerable Mah&acirc;kassapa heard, &amp;c.--and the venerable Mah&acirc;ka<I>k</I><I>k</I>&acirc;na heard, &amp;c.--and the venerable Mah&acirc;ko<I>t</I><I>th</I>ita&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_580"></A><A HREF="#fn_569"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> heard, &amp;c.--and the venerable Mah&acirc;kappina heard, &amp;c.--and the venerable Mah&acirc;<I>k</I>unda heard, &amp;c.--and the venerable Anuruddha heard, &amp;c.--and the venerable Revata heard, &amp;c.--and the venerable Up&acirc;li heard, &amp;c.--and the venerable &Acirc;nanda heard, &amp;c.--and the venerable R&acirc;hula heard (&amp;c., as above).</p>  
<p>7. And Mah&acirc;pa<I>g</I>&acirc;pati Gotam&icirc; heard: 'Those litigious, contentious, quarrelsome, disputatious Bhikkhus of Kosamb&icirc;, the constant raisers of questions before the Sa<I>m</I>gha, are coming to S&acirc;vatthi.' And Mah&acirc;pa<I>g</I>&acirc;pati Gotam&icirc; went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, she stationed herself near him. Standing near him Mah&acirc;pa<I>g</I>&acirc;pati Gotam&icirc; said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, those litigious, contentious (&amp;c., down to:) are coming to S&acirc;vatthi. How am I to behave, Lord, towards those Bhikkhus?'</p>  
<p>'Well, Gotam&icirc;, hear the Dhamma on both sides. When you have heard the Dhamma on both sides,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_318"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 318</FONT></A></p>  
<p>then accept the opinion and the belief and the doctrine and the cause of those Bhikkhus who are right according to the Dhamma; and whatever the Bhikkhun&icirc;sa<I>m</I>gha has to apply for to the Bhikkhusa<I>m</I>gha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_581"></A><A HREF="#fn_570"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for all that you must apply to the party of those who are right.'</p>  
<p>8. And An&acirc;tha-pi<I>n</I><I>d</I>ika the householder heard (&amp;c., as in 3, down to:). 'How am I to behave, Lord, towards those Bhikkhus?'</p>  
<p>'Well, householder, bestow gifts on both sides; having bestowed gifts on both sides, hear the Dhamma on both sides. When you have heard the Dhamma on both sides, then accept the opinion and the belief and the doctrine and the cause of those Bhikkhus who are right according to the Dhamma.'</p>  
<p>9. And Vis&acirc;kh&acirc; Mig&acirc;ram&acirc;t&acirc; heard, &amp;c.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_582"></A><A HREF="#fn_571"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>10. And the Bhikkhus of Kosamb&icirc; in due course came to S&acirc;vatthi. And the venerable S&acirc;riputta went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him. Sitting near him the venerable S&acirc;riputta said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, those litigious, contentious, quarrelsome, disputatious Bhikkhus of Kosamb&icirc;, the constant raisers of questions before the Sa<I>m</I>gha, have arrived at S&acirc;vatthi. How are we, Lord, to arrange the dwelling-places of those Bhikkhus?'</p>  
<p>'Well, S&acirc;riputta, assign separate dwelling-places to them.'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_319"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 319</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'And if there be no separate dwelling-places, what are we to do then, Lord?'</p>  
<p>'Then, S&acirc;riputta, you must separate (some dwelling-places from the rest) and then assign them (to those Bhikkhus). But in no wise, S&acirc;riputta, do I say that the dwelling-place of a senior Bhikkhu must be taken from him. He who does that, commits a dukka<I>t</I>a offence.'</p>  
<p>'And how are we to act, Lord, regarding (the distribution of) material gifts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_583"></A><A HREF="#fn_572"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>?'</p>  
<p>'Material gifts, S&acirc;riputta, must be distributed among all in equal parts.'</p>  
<p>11. And that Bhikkhu against whom expulsion had been pronounced, pondering over both Dhamma and Vinaya, came to the following conclusion: 'This is an offence; this is not no offence. I am an offender; I am not offenceless. I am expelled; I am not un-expelled. The sentence by which I have been expelled is lawful, unobjectionable, and valid.' Then that expelled Bhikkhu went to the expelled Bhikkhu's partisans; having approached them, he said to the partisans of the expelled Bhikkhu: 'This is an offence, friends; this is not no offence, &amp;c. Come now, my venerable brethren, and restore me.'</p>  
<p>12. Then the partisans of that expelled Bhikkhu took with them the expelled Bhikkhu, and went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, they sat down near him. Sitting near him those Bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, this Bhikkhu, against whom expulsion has been pronounced, says, "This is an offence, friends (&amp;c.,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_320"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 320</FONT></A></p>  
<p>down to:) and restore me." What are we to do here, Lord?'</p>  
<p>This is an offence, O Bhikkhus; this is not no offence. This Bhikkhu is an offender; this Bhikkhu is not offenceless. This Bhikkhu is expelled; he is not unexpelled; the sentence by which he has been expelled is lawful, unobjectionable, and valid. But since this Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, having committed an offence, and having been sentenced to expulsion, sees (his offence), restore now that Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus.'</p>  
<p>13. And the partisans of that expelled Bhikkhu, having restored that expelled Bhikkhu, went to the Bhikkhus who had sentenced him to expulsion; having approached them, they said to the Bhikkhus who had pronounced that sentence: 'As regards that matter, friends, which gave origin to altercations among the Sa<I>m</I>gha, to contentions, discord, quarrels, divisions among the Sa<I>m</I>gha, to disunion among the Sa<I>m</I>gha, to separations among the Sa<I>m</I>gha, to schisms among the Sa<I>m</I>gha,--that Bhikkhu (who was concerned in that matter), having committed an offence, and having been sentenced to expulsion, has seen (his offence) and has been restored. Come, friends, let us declare now the re-establishment of concord among the Sa<I>m</I>gha in order to bring that matter to an end.'</p>  
<p>Then the Bhikkhus who had pronounced that sentence of expulsion, went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, they sat down near him; sitting near him those Bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, those partisans of the expelled Bhikkhu have said to us: "As regards</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_321"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 321</FONT></A></p>  
<p>that matter (&amp;c., down to:) in order to bring that matter to an end." What are we to do here, Lord?'</p>  
<p>14. 'Since this Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, having committed an offence, and having been sentenced to expulsion, has seen (his offence) and has been re-stored, let the Sa<I>m</I>gha, O Bhikkhus, declare the re-establishment of concord in order to bring that matter to an end. And this declaration is to be performed in this way: Let all brethren assemble together, both the sick and the healthy; no one is allowed to send his declaration of kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_584"></A><A HREF="#fn_573"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (and to stay away). When you have assembled, let a learned, competent Bhikkhu proclaim the following <I>&ntilde;</I>atti before the Sa<I>m</I>gha: "Let the Sa<I>m</I>gha, reverend Sirs, hear me. As regards that matter which gave origin to altercations among the Sa<I>m</I>gha, to contentions, discord, quarrels, divisions among the Sa<I>m</I>gha, to disunion among the Sa<I>m</I>gha, to separations among the Sa<I>m</I>gha, to schisms among the Sa<I>m</I>gha,--that Bhikkhu (concerned in that matter), having committed an offence, and having been sentenced to expulsion, has seen (his offence) and has been restored. If the Sa<I>m</I>gha is ready, let the Sa<I>m</I>gha declare the re-establishment of concord in order to bring that matter to an end. This is the <I>&ntilde;</I>atti. Let the Sa<I>m</I>gha, reverend Sirs, hear me (&amp;c.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_585"></A><A HREF="#fn_574"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, down to:) the re-establishment of concord, in order to bring that matter to an end, has been declared by the Sa<I>m</I>gha; the division that existed among the Sa<I>m</I>gha has been settled; the disunion that existed</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_322"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 322</FONT></A></p>  
<p>among the Sa<I>m</I>gha has been settled. The Sa<I>m</I>gha is in favour (of this declaration); therefore you are silent; thus I understand." Then let the Sa<I>m</I>gha hold Uposatha and proclaim the P&acirc;timokkha.'</p>
