<p>journey towards S&acirc;vatthi. And in due course, journeying straight on, he arrived at S&acirc;vatthi, and there, at S&acirc;vatthi, the Blessed One stayed in the &Acirc;rama of An&acirc;tha-pi<I>n</I><I>d</I>ika.</p>  
<p>Now at that time there was in S&acirc;vatthi great abundance of solid food in the shape of fruits. And the question arose among the Bhikkhus, 'Has, now, the Blessed One permitted the use of fruits as solid food, or has he not?'</p>  
<p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, all solid food in the shape of fruits.'</p>
