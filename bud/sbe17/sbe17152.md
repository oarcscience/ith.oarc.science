### 7.

1\. Now the venerable Upâli went up to the place where the Blessed One
was; and on arriving there, he saluted the Blessed One, and took his
seat on one side. And when he was so seated the venerable Upâli said to
the Blessed One: 'Now in what case, Lord, can there be an interruption
of the Mânatta discipline <span id="fr_727"></span>[2](#fn_709) of a
Bhikkhu who is undergoing that discipline?'

There are four ways of interruption of the Mânatta discipline, O Upâli,
of a Bhikkhu who is undergoing that discipline; (that is to say), by
dwelling together <span id="fr_728"></span>[3](#fn_710), by dwelling
alone <span id="fr_729"></span>[3](#fn_710), by not announcing <span
id="fr_730"></span>[3](#fn_710), and by living with less than four other
Bhikkhus <span id="fr_731"></span>[4](#fn_711). These are the four ways
(&c., as before, down to) undergoing that discipline.'
