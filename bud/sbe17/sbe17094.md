### 27.

1\. Now at that time two Bhikkhus were journeying along a high road in
the country of Kosala. And they came to a certain residence, and there
one of the two fell ill. Then the Bhikkhus there thought: 'Waiting upon
the sick has been highly spoken of by the Blessed One. Let us then,
friends, now wait upon this Bhikkhu.' And they waited upon him, and
while he was being nursed by them, he completed his time <span
id="fr_465"></span>[1](#fn_457.md). Then those Bhikkhus took that Bhikkhu's
bowl and his robes, and went to Sâvatthi, and told the matter to the
Blessed One.

'On the death of a Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, the Sa*m*gha becomes the owner
of his bowl and of his robes. But, now, those who wait upon the sick are
of much service. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that the bowl and the set of
robes are to be assigned by the

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sa*m*gha to them
who have waited upon the sick. And thus, O Bhikkhus, are they to be
assigned. The Bhikkhu who has waited upon the sick ought to go before
the Sa*m*gha, and to say thus: "Such and such a Bhikkhu, Sirs, has
completed his time. These are his set of robes and his bowl." Then a
discreet and able Bhikkhu ought to lay the proposition before the
Sa*m*gha, saying, "Let the Sa*m*gha hear me. Such and such a Bhikkhu has
completed his time. These are his set of robes and his bowl. If it is
convenient to the Sa*m*gha, let the Sa*m*gha assign this set of robes
and this bowl to those who have waited upon the sick." This is the
*ñ*atti.' \[Here follow the usual formal words of a kammavâ*k*â <span
id="fr_466"></span>[1](#fn_458.md).\]

3\. Now at that time a certain Sâma*n*era had completed his time.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

\[The decision and the kammavâ*k*â are the same as in §2.\]

4\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu and a Sâma*n*era waited upon a
sick Bhikkhu; and while he was being waited upon by them he completed
his time. And the Bhikkhu who had waited upon the sick thought: 'How now
ought the due portion of robes be given to the Sâma*n*era who waited
upon the sick?'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you are to give an equal portion to a
Sâma*n*era who waits upon the sick.'

5\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu who was

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

possessed of much property, and of a plentiful supply of a Bhikkhu's
requisites, completed his time.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'On the death of a Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, the Sa*m*gha becomes the owner
of his bowl and of his robes. But, now, those who wait upon the sick are
of much service. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that the set of robes and the
bowl are to be assigned by the Sa*m*gha to them who have waited upon the
sick. And whatever little property and small supply of a Bhikkhu's
requisites there may be, that is to be divided by the Sa*m*gha that are
present there; but whatever large quantity of property and large supply
of a Bhikkhu's requisites there may be, that is not to be given
away <span id="fr_467"></span>[1](#fn_459.md) and not to be
apportioned <span id="fr_468"></span>[2](#fn_460.md), but to belong to the
Sa*m*gha of the four directions <span id="fr_469"></span>[3](#fn_461.md),
those who have come in, and those who have not <span
id="fr_470"></span>[4](#fn_462.md).'
