### 8.

1\. 'A Bhikkhu, after the Ka*th*ina ceremony has been held, goes away
with the expectation of getting a robe (presented). And when he has got
beyond the boundary, &c. And he adopts such a course of action as may
lead to his expectation being realised. But he obtains a robe where he
had not expected it, and does not obtain it where he had expected it.
And he thinks, "I will have the robe made up here, and will never go
back." And he gets the robe made up.

'That Bhikkhu's Ka*th*ina privileges are suspended on the ground of his
having a robe ready for wear.

'A Bhikkhu, after the Ka*th*ina ceremony has been

held (&c., as in the preceding case). And he thinks, "I will neither
have the robe made up, nor will I go back."

'That Bhikkhu's Ka*th*ina privileges are suspended on the ground of his
having so decided.

'A Bhikkhu, after the Ka*th*ina ceremony has been held, &c. And he
thinks, "I will have the robe made up here, and will never go back." And
he has the robe made up. And as the robe is being made up for him, it is
spoilt.

'That Bhikkhu's Ka*th*ina privileges are suspended on the ground of the
robe being so spoilt.

'A Bhikkhu, after the Ka*th*ina ceremony has been held, goes away with
the expectation of getting a robe (presented). And when he has got
beyond the boundary, he thinks, "I will adopt here such a course of
action as may lead to my expectation being realised, and will never go
back." And he devotes himself to obtaining that expected gift, but his
expectation comes to nothing.

'That Bhikkhu's Ka*th*ina privileges are suspended on the ground of the
lapse of that expectation.'
