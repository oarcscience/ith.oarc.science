<p>Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to go into the villages with their shoes on. The people were annoyed, murmured, and became angry, saying, That is how those behave who are still enjoying the pleasures of the world!'</p>  
<p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not to go into the villages, O Bhikkhus, with your shoes on. Whosoever does so, is guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a offence.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu was sick, and unable to go into the village without shoes on. They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow a sick Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, to go into the village with his shoes on.'</p>
