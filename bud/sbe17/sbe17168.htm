<p>1. Whilst he was undergoing that probation he committed an offence--the first Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa--which for five days he concealed.</p>  
<p>He told, &amp;c. . . . 'I committed, &amp;c. . . . I asked, &amp;c. . . . The Sa<I>m</I>gha imposed a probation of half a month, &amp;c. . . . Whilst I was undergoing, &amp;c. . . What now shall I do?'</p>  
<p>They told, &amp;c.</p>

It is clear from the next chapter that this probation did not affect the M&acirc;natta to which he was liable for that first offence. The M&acirc;natta always lasted six days, and was preceded by a probation equal in length to the time during which the offence had been concealed. If now, during that probation, another offence was committed and concealed, the penalties for this new offence and for the old one were not accumulative but concurrent. The offender lost the advantage of the probation he had already undergone, he was thrown back to the commencement of his term of probation, and had to begin again. But the new term of probation--equal in length to whichever was the longest of the two periods during which he had concealed the two offences--satisfied both the concealments, and the M&acirc;natta which still, as it would have done before, followed at the end of the probation, satisfied both the offences. See our note below on chapter 20.</P>
