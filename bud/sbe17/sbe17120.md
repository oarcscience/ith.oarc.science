#### II. THE NISSAYA-KAMMA (ACT OF SUBORDINATION).

### 9.

1\. Now at that time the venerable Seyyasaka was stupid, and indiscreet,
and full of faults, and devoid of merit, and was living in lay society
in unlawful association with the world <span
id="fr_622"></span>[1](#fn_610.md). So much so that the Bhikkhus were worn
out <span id="fr_623"></span>[2](#fn_611.md) with placing him on
probation <span id="fr_624"></span>[3](#fn_612.md), and with throwing him
back to the beginning (of his probationary term) <span
id="fr_625"></span>[4](#fn_613.md), and with subjecting him to the mânatta
discipline <span id="fr_626"></span>[5](#fn_614.md), and with
rehabilitating him <span id="fr_627"></span>[6](#fn_615.md). The moderate
Bhikkhus were annoyed, and murmured, and became indignant

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (saying), 'How can
the venerable Seyyasaka be so stupid (&c., as before), that the Bhikkhus
are worn out (&c., as before)?'

Then those Bhikkhus told that matter to the Blessed One.

And the Blessed One on that occasion, and in that connection, convened a
meeting of the Bhikkhusa*m*gha, and asked the Bhikkhus, 'Is it true, O
Bhikkhus, as they say, that the venerable Seyyasaka is stupid (&c., as
before, down to) with rehabilitating him?'

'It is true, Lord!'

The Blessed Buddha rebuked him (saying), 'This is improper' (&c., as
usual, compare I, 2, 3, down to), and addressed the Bhikkhus, and said,
'Let the Sa*m*gha therefore, O Bhikkhus, carry out the Nissaya-kamma
(Act of Subordination) against the venerable Seyyasaka: "Thou must
remain under the superintendence of others <span
id="fr_628"></span>[1](#fn_616.md)."

2\. 'Now thus, O Bhikkhus, should it be carried out. In the first place
the Bhikkhu Seyyasaka ought to be warned; when he has been warned, he
ought to be reminded <span id="fr_629"></span>[2](#fn_617.md); when he has
been reminded, he ought to be charged with the offence <span
id="fr_630"></span>[2](#fn_617.md); when he has been charged with the
offence, some discreet and able Bhikkhu ought to lay the matter before
the Sa*m*gha (saying),

"Let the venerable Sa*m*gha hear me (&c., as usual; see above, chapters
1. 4. and 8. 2)."'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_610"></span>[343:1](sbe17120.htm#fr_622.md) There is no rule
in the Pâtimokkha in which any of these things are declared to be an
offence. The 31st and 85th Pâ*k*ittiyas only refer to a Bhikkhu's
staying an unreasonable time in a public rest-house, and to his
frequenting a village beyond the ordinary occasions. Stupidity, and
keeping low company, are not mentioned. Why then should Seyyasaka have
been placed upon probation? We think the answer will appear from our
note I on II, I, X.

<span id="fn_611"></span>[343:2](sbe17120.htm#fr_623.md) Pakatâ, 'done up,'
explained by vâva*t*â. See Oldenberg's quotation from Buddhaghosa at p.
310 of his edition of the text.

<span id="fn_612"></span>[343:3](sbe17120.htm#fr_624.md) Compare Mahâvagga
I, 38, 1; Mahâ-parinibbâna Sutta V, 64, 65; and *K*ullavagga III, 3. On
the distinction between these kinds of probation, see also our note
below on II, 1, I.

<span id="fn_613"></span>[343:4](sbe17120.htm#fr_625.md) See below, II, 2,
I. Compare also Subhûti's explanation in Childers, and the passages
quoted in the index to Oldenberg's edition of the text, p. 348, sub
voce, especially *K*ullavagga III, 7.

<span id="fn_614"></span>[343:5](sbe17120.htm#fr_626.md) See below,
*K*ullavagga III, 1; III, 4.

<span id="fn_615"></span>[343:6](sbe17120.htm#fr_627.md) See below;
*K*ullavagga III, 2; III, 5.

<span id="fn_616"></span>[344:1](sbe17120.htm#fr_628.md) These are the
distinctive and technical words of the Nissaya-kamma, just as the
corresponding clause in chap. 13, § 7 contains the technical words of
the Pabbâ*g*aniya-kamma.

<span id="fn_617"></span>[344:2](sbe17120.htm#fr_630.md) As explained
above, chap. 1. 4.
