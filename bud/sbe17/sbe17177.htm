<p>2. 'Now in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu have committed two Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa offences, which he has concealed for two months. And he is aware of one offence, but of the other offence he is not aware. And he asks the Sa<I>m</I>gha for a two months' probation for that offence of which he is aware, concealed for two months. And the Sa<I>m</I>gha gives him a probation of two months for an offence concealed for two months. And whilst he is undergoing that probation he becomes aware of the other offence. Then it occurs to him,</p>  
<p>Lo! I have committed two Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa offences (&amp;c., as in the last paragraph, down to) I became aware of the other offence. Let me now ask the Sa<I>m</I>gha for a probation of two months for that other offence concealed for two months."</p>  
<p>And he asks the Sa<I>m</I>gha for a probation of two months for that other offence concealed for two months. And the Sa<I>m</I>gha imposes upon him a probation of &amp;c. . . . for &amp;c. . . . That Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, ought to continue on probation for two months from that date.</p>  
<p>3. 'Now in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu commit two Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa offences, which he conceals for two months; and one offence he recollects, but the other offence he does not recollect.

And he asks the Sa<I>m</I>gha (&amp;c., as in the last section, reading "is doubtful" for "does not recollect").</p>  
<p>5. 'Now in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu commit two Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa offences, which he conceals for two months; and one offence he conceals wittingly, but the other offence he conceals unwittingly. And he asks the Sa<I>m</I>gha for a probation of two months for those two offences concealed for two months. And the Sa<I>m</I>gha imposes upon him a probation of two months for those, two offences concealed for two months. And whilst he is undergoing that probation there arrives a Bhikkhu who is versed in the traditions, acquainted with the tradition, a custodian of the Dhamma, of the Vinaya, and of the M&acirc;tik&acirc;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_740"></A><A HREF="#fn_719"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, clever, discreet, wise, modest, sensitive, willing to learn. And he speaks thus:</p>  
<p>"What has this Bhikkhu, O friends, been guilty of, and why is he on probation?"</p>  
<p>'And they reply: "This Bhikkhu, O friend, has committed two Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa offences, which he concealed for two months; and one offence he concealed wittingly, and one offence he concealed unwittingly, He asked the Sa<I>m</I>gha for a probation of two months for those two offences concealed for two months. And the Sa<I>m</I>gha imposed upon him a probation of two months for those two offences concealed</p>

<p>for two months. Therein, O friend, is this Bhikkhu guilty, and therefore is he on probation."</p>  
<p>'And he rejoins: "The offence which he wittingly concealed, O friends, for that the imposition of a probation is valid, and by reason of its validity it takes effect&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_741"></A><A HREF="#fn_720"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. But the offence which he unwittingly concealed, O friends, for that the imposition of a probation is invalid, and by reason of its invalidity it does not take effect. For this offence, O friends, the Bhikkhu is liable to a M&acirc;natta."</p>  
<p>6. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu commit two Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa offences, which he conceals for two months. And one offence he conceals recollecting it, but the other offence he conceals without recollecting it.'</p>
