### 12.

1\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus used to put pulverised ointments into
pots and saucers. They became sprinkled over with herb-powders and dust.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a box for ointment.'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to carry about various
kinds of boxes for ointments--gold ones, and silver ones. People were
annoyed, murmured, and became angry, saying, 'Like those who still live
in the world.'

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'Various kinds of boxes for ointments, gold ones. and silver ones, are
not, O Bhikkhus, to be used. Whosoever does so, is guilty of a dukka*t*a
offence. I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of such boxes made of bone, or
ivory, or horn, or of the na*l*a reed, or of bambu, or of wood, or of
lac, or of the shells of fruit, or of bronze, or of the centre of the
chank-shell <span id="fr_129"></span>[5](#fn_127.md).'

2\. Now at that time the boxes of ointment had no lid. (The ointment)
was sprinkled over with herb-powders and dust.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a lid.'

The lids used to fall off.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to fasten the lid with thread, and to tie it
on to the box.'

The boxes used to fall.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to sew the boxes on with thread <span
id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_128.md).'

3\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus used to rub the ointment on with their
fingers: and the eyes were hurt.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a stick or holder to put the ointment
on with.'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to keep various kinds
of ointment-sticks--gold ones, and silver ones. People were annoyed,
murmured, and became angry, saying, 'Like those who still live in the
world.'

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'Various kinds of ointment-holders, O Bhikkhus, are not to be used.
Whosoever does so, is guilty of. a dukka*t*a offence. I allow, O
Bhikkhus, the use of ointment-holders of bone, or of ivory, or of horn,
or of the na*l*a reed, or of bambu, or of wood, or of lac, or of fruit,
or of bronze, or of the chank-shell.'

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

4\. Now at that time the ointment-sticks used to fall on the ground and
become rough.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a case for the ointment-sticks <span
id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_129.md).'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus used to carry the ointment-boxes and
ointment-sticks about in their hands.

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a bag to put the ointment-box in.'

They had no shoulder strap.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a shoulder strap (by which to carry the
ointment-box), or of a thread (by which to sew or tie it on).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_127"></span>[51:5](sbe17026.htm#fr_129.md) Saṅkha-nâbhi, the
meaning of the latter part of which compound is not quite clear.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[52:1](sbe17026.htm#fr_130.md) Buddhaghosa has no
comment on this. It may mean that the ointment boxes might be sewn
either on to some place in the Vihâra, or on to some part of the
Bhikkhu's dress. The latter is more in accordance with § 4 below.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[53:1](sbe17026.htm#fr_131.md) Salâkodhâniyan ti
yattha salâka*m* odahanti susiradantaka*m* vâ thâlika*m* vâ anu*g*anâmî
’ti attho (B.).
