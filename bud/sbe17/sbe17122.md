the traditions; a man to whom the Nikâyas had been handed down; a
reciter of the Dhamma, of the Vinaya, and of the Mâtikas; clever,
discreet, wise, modest, full of remorse, and docile; he conducted
himself aright, he became subdued, he sought for release, and going up
to the Bhikkhus, he spake as follows:

Nissaya-kamma, am conducting myself aright, and have become subdued, and

Bhikkhu Seyyasaka.

Ta*gg*aniya-kamma).'
