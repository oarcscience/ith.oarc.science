#### VI. THE UKKHEPANIYA-KAMMA for not renouncing a sinful doctrine.

### 32.

1\. Now at that time the Blessed Buddha was staying at Sâvatthi, in the
*G*etavana, the grove of Anâthapi*nd*ika. And at that time a certain
Bhikkhu by name Ari*tth*a, who had formerly been a vulture
tormentor <span id="fr_687"></span>[1](#fn_669.md), had fallen into a
sinful belief of this kind; (that is to say), 'In this wise do I
understand the Dhamma preached by the Blessed One, that to him who
practises those things which have been declared by the Blessed One to be
impediments <span id="fr_688"></span>[2](#fn_670.md),

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

there will arise no impediment sufficient (to prevent his acquiring
spiritual gifts) <span id="fr_689"></span>[1](#fn_671.md).'

Now many Bhikkhus heard that Ari*tth*a, who had formerly (&c., as
before, down to:) to be impediments. And those Bhikkhus went up to the
place where Ari*tth*a the Bhikkhu, who had formerly been a vulture
tormentor, was; and on arriving there they asked Ari*tth*a the Bhikkhu,
who had formerly been a vulture tormentor, 'Is it true, friend
Ari*tth*a, as they say, that you have fallen into a sinful belief (&c.,
as above, down to) spiritual gifts?'

'Certainly <span id="fr_690"></span>[2](#fn_672.md)! I do so understand the
Dhamma preached by the Blessed One (&c., as before):

2\. 'Say not so, friend Ari*tth*a. Bear not false-witness against the
Blessed One. For neither is it seemly to bring a false accusation
against the Blessed One, nor could the Blessed One have spoken so. By
many a figure, friend Ari*tth*a, have the things which are impediments
been declared to be impediments by the Blessed One, and also to be
sufficient to prevent him who cultivates them (from attaining to
spiritual gifts) <span id="fr_691"></span>[3](#fn_673.md). Lusts have been
declared by the Blessed One to be of short taste <span
id="fr_692"></span>[4](#fn_674.md), full of pain, and full of despair,
things wherein the danger is great. Lusts have been declared by the
Blessed One to be like the bones of a skeleton, full of pain, and full
of despair, things wherein the danger is

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

great. Lusts have been declared by the Blessed One to be like lumps of
raw meat, full (&c., as before, down to:) is great. Lusts have been
declared by the Blessed One to be like torches made of a wisp of hay . .
. ., like a pit full of live coals <span id="fr_693"></span>[1](#fn_675.md)
. . . ., like the visions of a dream . . . ., like a beggar's portion .
. . ., like the fruits of trees . . . ., like the sword and the
slaughter-house . . . ., like darts and clubs . . . ., like snakes and
creeping things, full of pain, and full of despair, things wherein the
danger is great.'

Yet notwithstanding that Bhikkhu Ari*tth*a, who had formerly been a
vulture tormentor, when thus being addressed by the Bhikkhus, remained
steadfastly adhering, in the very same way, and with violence, to that
sinful doctrine, declaring, 'Verily I do so understand the Dhamma
preached by the Blessed One (&c., as before, in § 1).'

3\. Then since those Bhikkhus were unable to move Ari*tth*a the Bhikkhu,
who had formerly been a vulture tormentor, from that sinful doctrine,
they went up to the place where the Blessed One was; and when they had
come there, they told this thing to the Blessed One.

And the Blessed One on that occasion, and in that connection, convened a
meeting of the Bhikkhusa*m*gha, and asked Ari*tth*a the Bhikkhu, who had
formerly been a vulture tormentor, 'Is it true, as they say, Ari*tth*a,
that you have fallen into a sinful doctrine of such a kind (&c., as
before, in § 1)?'

'Certainly, Lord! I do so understand (&c., as before, in § 1).'

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

'How can you, O foolish one, so understand the Dhamma preached by me?
Have I not, by many a figure, O foolish one, declared the things which
are impediments to be impediments, and sufficient to prevent him who
cultivates them (from attaining to spiritual gifts)? Have not lusts been
by me declared to be of short taste (&c., as above, down to:) like
snakes and creeping things, full of danger, full of despair, things
wherein the danger is great? Yet now you, O foolish one, by your having
grasped that doctrine wrongly <span id="fr_694"></span>[1](#fn_676.md), are
not only bearing false-witness against us, but you are also rooting
yourself up, and are giving rise to much demerit, the which will be to
you for a long time for an evil and a woe. This will not conduce, O
foolish one, either to the conversion of the unconverted, or to the
increase of the converted; but rather to those who are unconverted not
being converted, and to the turning back of those who have been
converted <span id="fr_695"></span>[2](#fn_677.md).'

When he had thus rebuked him, and had delivered a religious discourse,
he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: Let therefore the Sa*m*gha, O
Bhikkhus, carry out against Ari*tth*a the Bhikkhu, who was formerly a
vulture tormentor, the Ukkhepaniyakamma, for not renouncing a sinful
doctrine, to the intent that he shall not eat or dwell together with the
Sa*m*gha.'

4\. 'Now thus, O Bhikkhus, should it be carried out. In the first place
the Bhikkhu Ari*tth*a ought

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

to be warned \[&c., as in chapter 25, down to the end of the
Kammavâ*k*â, including the supplementary sentence as to the
proclamation\].'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_669"></span>[377:1](sbe17142.htm#fr_687.md) In his commentary
on the Pâ*k*ittiya, quoted by Oldenberg in his note on this passage,
Buddhaghosa explains this expression to mean 'born in a family of
vulture slayers.' This does not, help us much, vulture slaying as a
regular occupation being somewhat incomprehensible, and not referred to
elsewhere. Whatever its meaning, the occupation referred to is perhaps
the origin of, or should at least be compared with, the statement of
Ktesias (circa B.C. 400) in his 'Indika' (ed. C. Müller, Fragment xiii),
that the Indians used not dogs but vultures, which they trained for that
purpose, in hunting hares and foxes. Lassen in his 'Indische
Alterthumskunde,' II, 638, 639, thinks this statement not incredible,
very fairly comparing the use of falcons in Europe in the Middle Ages.
It is not impossible that the correct rendering here should be
'vulture-catcher,' or 'vulture-trainer;' but we prefer to be literal.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[377:2](sbe17142.htm#fr_688.md) The only one of
such things (Dhammâ) known to us elsewhere in the Vinaya Pi*t*aka itself
is deliberate falsehood. This is stated in Mahâvagga II, 3, 3 to be an
impediment, which is explained by the Old Commentator, at Mahâvagga II,
3, 7, to mean an impediment to the attainment of the Ghânas, and other
things of similar nature.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[378:1](sbe17142.htm#fr_689.md) This is word for
word the same speech as that which is condemned in the 68th and 70th
Pâ*k*ittiyas.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[378:2](sbe17142.htm#fr_690.md) Byâ is only known
to us as an intensive particle occurring in passages like the present
one.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[378:3](sbe17142.htm#fr_691.md) So far this
section is word for word the same as the 68th and the 70th Pâ*k*ittiyas.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[378:4](sbe17142.htm#fr_692.md) Quoted at
Dhammapada, ver. 186.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[379:1](sbe17142.htm#fr_693.md) *G*âtaka I, 231,
232.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[380:1](sbe17142.htm#fr_694.md) Compare
Mahâ-parinibbâna Sutta IV, 8-11.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[380:2](sbe17142.htm#fr_695.md) Up to this point
the whole chapter recurs as the Introductory Story in the Sutta-vibhaṅga
on the 68th Pâ*k*ittiya.
