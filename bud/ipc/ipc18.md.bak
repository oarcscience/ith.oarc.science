### CHAPTER XV

#### TRANSUBSTANTIATION

<span class="small">Gibbon on the rites of the Agapae at
Alexandria—Professor Horace Hayman Wilson discovers similar rites in the

<span class="smallcaps">Mr. Meredith</span>, in his "Prophet of
Nazareth," tries to discover the origin of the Roman Catholic doctrine
of Transubstantiation. He traces it to the rites of the Agape mentioned
by Jude. These had to be modified as time went on. Gibbon thus describes
them.

"There were many who pretended to confess or to relate the ceremonies of
this abhorred society. It was asserted that a new-born infant entirely
covered over with flour was presented like some mystic symbol of
initiation to the knife of the proselyte, who unknowingly inflicted many
a secret and mortal wound on the innocent victim of his error; that as
soon as the cruel deed was perpetrated the sectaries drank up the blood,
greedily tore asunder the quivering members, and pledged themselves to
eternal secrecy by a mutual consciousness of guilt. It was as
confidently affirmed that this inhuman sacrifice was succeeded by a
suitable

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

entertainment, in which intemperance served as a provocation to brutal
lust, till at the appointed moment the lights were suddenly
extinguished, shame was banished, nature was forgotten, and as accident
might direct the darkness of the night was polluted by the incestuous
commerce of sisters and brothers, of sons and of mothers.

"But the perusal of the ancient apologies was sufficient to remove even
the slightest suspicion from the mind of a candid adversary. The
Christians, with the intrepid security of innocence, appeal from the
voice of rumour to the equity of the magistrates. . . . Nothing, it
should seem, could weaken the force or destroy the effect of so
unanswerable a justification unless it were the injudicious conduct of
the apologists themselves who betrayed the common cause of religion to
gratify their devout hatred of the domestic enemies of the church. It
was sometimes faintly insinuated and sometimes boldly asserted that the
same bloody sacrifices and the same incestuous festivals which were so
falsely ascribed to the orthodox believers were in reality celebrated by
the Marcionites, by the Carpocrations, and by several other sects of the
Gnostics. . . . Accusations of a similar kind were retorted upon the
church by the schismatics who had departed from its communion, and it
was confessed on all sides that the most scandalous licentiousness of
manners prevailed amongst great numbers of those who affected the name
of Christians."

Gibbon instances Tertullian who, when he became a Montanist, turned
against his former comrades. <span id="fr_239"></span>[\*](#fn_238.md) Mr.
Meredith, enlarging on this difficult question, comes to a conclusion
that a doctrine so utterly repugnant to reason as the Roman Catholic
doctrine of Transubstantiation must be a survival of something that once
had a logic. He urges that it is a modification

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

of something that had to be softened down. If he had had access to
Indian literature, he would have found this view confirmed.

The great Orientalist, Horace Hayman Wilson, was startled to find in the
S’ivan books scenes described very like those attributed to the
Christian Agapæ. The tântrika rites ought properly to be called the
Left-Handed Tantrikas (Vâmâcharîs) when applied to certain rites which
the celebrant, as Mr. Wilson puts it, "dare not publicly avow." <span
id="fr_240"></span>[\*](#fn_239.md) In the mysteries of the Durgâ-pûjah,
the great festival of nature's powers of reproduction, the Vâmâcharîs
had a Bacchantic rite which they called S’rî Ka Chakra (the "Wheel of
S’rî"). The upper vests of the women were taken off and put in a basket,
and the males present each took one of these, and this accident
indicated to him his partner in the coming debauchery. A naked female
presided at the great mystery. She was Durgâ in person; and the males
were called Bhairavas and the women Bhairavîs. Each in fact was supposed
to be S’iva himself, the great giver of life, or his other half.

The Devî Rashya, a Hindu work which treats on the subject, settles that
the women must be "a dancing girl, a female devotee, a harlot, a
washerwoman or barber's wife, a female of the Brahmanical or Indra
tribe, a flower-girl or a milkmaid." The members of the sect were
enjoined to preserve their mystery a complete secret. Exactly at the
hour of midnight the rampant orgy was to take place.

I will turn to another Indian work. It is called the Sanguinary Chapter
of the Kâlî ka Purâna, and a translation of it is given by Mr.
Blacquiere in Volume V. of the old "Asiatic Researches." The God S’iva
tells in person how the divine favour is to be obtained, and announces
that it is "though sacrifices that

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

princes obtain bliss, heaven and victory over their enemies." His wife
Kâlî is particular in her tastes, and the animals that she likes are
enumerated. Thus the blood of a wild bull gives pleasure for a year; but
"a bird whose throat is blue and head red and legs black with white
feathers" is quite her favourite. And the Rohita fish gives her pleasure
for three hundred years.

But it is when we come to warm human flesh and blood that we see her
real sentiments.

"An oblation of blood which has been rendered pure by holy texts is the
Ambrosia (amrita)."

One special sacrifice is described at length.

The victim must be willing and must be a person of good appearance. He
must be prepared by ablutions and requisite ceremonies such as eating
consecrated food the day before. He must be adorned with chaplets of
flowers and besmeared with sandal wood. Death should be given with the
Chandrahasa, a sort of axe. The sacrificer's face must be towards the
North, and the victim's towards the East.

Then the sacrificer is called upon to worship the several deities
presiding over the different parts of the victim's body. Let him worship
Brahmâ in the victim's Brahmâ Randhra (a cavity in the skull). Let him
worship the earth in his nose, saying Medenyaiah Nâmah, and casting a
flower; in his ears Akasa, the subtle æther, saying Akasaya Nâmah. Let
him worship Fire on his left cheek, Death on his throat, the Moon on his
forehead, and the Serpent King in his belly.

Then let him make the following invocation:—

"O best of men! O most auspicious! O thou who art an assemblage of all
the deities, and most exquisite! Bestow thy protection on me, save me
thy devoted. Save my sons, my cattle and kindred, preserve the state,
the ministers belonging to it and

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

all my friends. And as death is unavoidable, part with thy life doing an
act of benevolence. Bestow upon me, O most auspicious, the bliss that is
obtained by the most austere devotion, by acts of charity and the
performance of religious ceremonies; and at the same time, O most
excellent, attain supreme bliss thyself. May thy auspices, O most
auspicious, keep me secure from Râkshasas, Piśâchas, terrors, serpents,
bad princes, and other evils. And death being inevitable, may they charm
Bhâgavatî in the last moments by copious streams of blood spouting from
the arteries of thy fleshy neck."

It is plain from all this that the victim is an impersonation of S’iva,
and this fact is not concealed.

"When this has been done, O my children, the victim is even as myself,
and the guardian deities of the ten quarters take care of him. Then
Brahmâ and all the other deities assemble on the victim." <span
id="fr_241"></span>[\*](#fn_240.md)

Now if we compare all this with the transubstantiation rites of the
Roman Catholic Church, we find a close analogy. In each a God under one
aspect of himself sacrifices himself to another aspect of himself, that
his faithful followers may drink that mixture of human blood and spirits
which the ancients believed to be the meat and drink of immortal
life. <span id="fr_242"></span>[†](#fn_241.md)

But it might be said that Victim, Priest and God were all united.

Also in each we find that the sacrifice was a make-believe, all the
adoration and prayer being made not to the God but the victim.

It seemed to me, too, on first reading the passage from the Kâlî ka
Purâna that it was a description of S’iva dying at the end of the year.

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

A perusal of the Great Mystery Play of Tibet fully confirmed me.

In the matter of devil dancing and sorcery, Tibet takes the lead.
Witness its great mystery play, which might be called the "Great
Apocalypse of Sorcery." Man, according to the Lâmas, is surrounded by
hordes of man-eating devils who vex him with diseases and accidents.
These demons infest the air, the earth, the water, and are ever seeking
to destroy him. Against this endless persecution he can himself do
nothing, but the great S’iva benignly comes to his aid and places at his
disposal charms, spells, talismans which are wielded by the good spirits
or Lâmas; and these aids can be obtained by a proper attention to Lâmaic
rites, and above all Lâmaic offerings. In the drama I am considering,
millions of fiends battle together, and brief victories occur, to the
good sometimes and the bad sometimes, for the effect of Karma or magical
energy is transient.

"And only for a time," says Surgeon-Major Waddell, "can this relief from
persecution endure for all the exorcisms of all the saints are of little
avail to keep back the advancing hordes. The shrieking demons must close
in upon the soul again." <span id="fr_243"></span>[\*](#fn_242.md)

The great "Miracle-play" or "Mystery" of Tibet is called "The
Sacrificial Body of the Dead Year;" and it "is acted on the last day of
the year by all sects of Lâmas," as Surgeon-Major Waddell tells us.

Strictly analysed it has two parts, and two distinct plots or motifs.

\(1\) To set forth the importance of Tântrika rites, charms, etc.

\(2\) To reveal the mighty secret of the old world, immortal life
through drinking the blood of S’iva, impersonating the dead year, and
being sacrificed for the purpose.

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

These sections are plainly of different dates; indeed, if you saw the
play acted for the first time, your first question would be—"What has
all this to do with the dead year, and where is its body?"

The first part is a tedious and overdone battle between demons white,
red, and black, who assail one another with charms and magic weapons.
The plot is a confused plot telling a local story of the Lama, who
assumed the disguise of a "black-hatted devil-dancer" to assassinate
King Lan Darma.

Then comes the part that most interests the modern reader.

Four ghouls bring on an object wrapped in a black cloth. These ghouls
are called the "Four Cemetery Ghouls." They place the object on the
ground, and dance round it "with intricate steps." They raise the cloth
and discover a large dough statue of a man. Organs representing the
heart, lungs, liver, brain, stomach, intestines, etc., are inserted into
it, and the heart and the large blood-vessels and limbs are filled with
a red-coloured fluid to represent blood. Plainly in the original version
of the play a real man was killed. This is confessed. Cannibalism was an
ingredient in the play until the great Tibetan saint, Padma Sambhava, in
the ninth century substituted a man of dough for a victim of human
flesh.

Then comes a great procession of pantomime gods and devils, naked
figures with the heads of tigers, serpents, horses, bulls, with
"demoniac Brahmâs" and Vishnus and Indras, and even "demoniac Buddhas,"
for every being, divine or otherwise, in S’ivism, has two aspects like
the divine chief. These are followed by the fiendesses, including the
"twelve Tan-ma" under Devî. Tom-toms sound, and cymbals and large
trumpets eight or ten feet long, and wooden tambourines, and a
portentous and long-drawn whistling "with the fingers on the mouth."

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

Now comes on the chief fiend, the "Religious King-devil," with the head
of a bull, holding in his right hand a dagger and in his left the pas’a
or Thug-noose. This character can only be assumed by a monk of the
purest morals. The Emperor of China on one occasion rewarded him with a
dress of great price. There is no great secrecy in this Mystery about
the identity of this Demon King. The more intelligent Lâmas admit that
he is S’iva as Mahâkâla, <span id="fr_244"></span>[\*](#fn_243.md) and that
the stage of this mighty drama is S’iva's hell.

Now for the great climax. After more devil-dancing the Demon King draws
a sword and stabs and hacks the figure of dough, ringing a bell all the
time, assisted by his devils, who tear the figure to pieces. These are
collected in a huge silver basin, shaped like a skull and carried in a
procession to the Demon King, who eats a small portion and then throws
the rest into the air. "They are fought for by the other demons, who
throw the pieces about in a frantic manner. Then a sacrifice of
apparently the same figure in papier maché is made, with blood and arak
in a human skull."

Now if we put this description side by side with that of the victim in
the S’ivan mystery, we find that they mutually explain one another. The
dough figure in Tibet is the "Sacrificial body of the dead year:" the
name explains everything. And so is the Victim described in the Kâlîka
Purâna. And the scraps of flesh and the skull with blood and spirit are
the immortal food scrambled for by the gods and men in the old
mysteries. Tibet in the old days reeked with cannibalism. "At the new
year in Tibet," says an ancient Chinese manuscript, deciphered by Dr.
Bushell, "the Tibetans sacrifice men, or offer monkeys." <span
id="fr_245"></span>[†](#fn_244.md)

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

"Up to the Middle Ages," says Dr. Waddell, "cannibalism is reported, and
vestiges survive in the dough images, the sacrifice of which form an
essential part of the Lâmaist daily worship." He mentions, too, that so
great is the craze for human flesh even now that the Tibetans chew a
portion of the human skin when preparing the human thigh bone for a
"bone trumpet." Also we learn from him that the neighbours of the Lâmas
in the Tsang Po valley are cannibals to this day. <span
id="fr_246"></span>[\*](#fn_245.md)

A minor scene in the great Miracle play must not be omitted. A figure of
a child in dough is brought in, and naked skeletons something like S’iva
as a skeleton, at Elora, dance round it and make believe to attack it
with long spears. Then, to solemn chanting, low music and the swinging
of censers, a stately procession comes through the porch of the temple
and slowly descends the steps. Under a canopy borne by attendants comes
a tall form in beautiful silk robes, wearing a large mask representing a
benign and peaceful face. "As he advanced, men and boys dressed as
abbots and acolytes of the Church of Rome," prostrated themselves before
him and addressed him with intoning and pleasing chanting. <span
id="fr_247"></span>[†](#fn_246.md) There are doubts whether this figure is
Padma Sambhava, a popular local saint and indeed local Buddha, or Buddha
himself. The demons flee away with loud shrieks. A more important
question arises:—Was this little child the new year? The pontiff covers
him with flour to render him safe against the fiends of hell. This
reminds one of what was alleged of the Gnostic sects in Alexandria.
They, too, covered a child with flour, at the date of the new year. But
why was he sacrificed? This seems to have been his fate both in
Alexandria and in Tibet. Logically, the big dough

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

figure is the old year and the little dough figure is the new year. What
is the white flour? plainly the white ash of the men and gods and
systems that remorseless Mahâkâla has swept away.

Mr. Meredith urges that even the phraseology of the Roman Catholic
Eucharist bears traces of a real sacrifice. The word "Sacramentum" in
old days could only have meant an oath, the oath, in fact, of the early
Christians not to reveal their mysteries under the pain of death. Then
the word "host" meant a sacrificial victim and not a piece of bread. And
what is still called the "altar" must have been a real altar up to the
time when the ninth and tenth Canon of the Council of Nice imposed upon
the Christian priests degradation if they sacrificed any more." <span
id="fr_248"></span>[\*](#fn_247.md) And the word "mass" from "Ita missa
est" was also pagan. Certainly, the Catholic and the Tibetan
"mysteries," and their modifications seem to have run on the same lines.

But how terribly important is all this to our special investigation,
cannibalism and Bacchantic licentiousness forced into the Holy of Holies
of the religion of the blameless, vegetarian, water-drinker S’âkya Muni.
