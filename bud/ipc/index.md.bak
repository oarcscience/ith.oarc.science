The connection between Christianity and Buddhism is unmistakable, both
in terms of the traditional narratives of the respective founders, and
in their parable-riddled attributed sayings. Some, particularly
occultists, have attempted to explain this by proposing a residence in
India by Jesus during his 'lost years,' for instance,
[Notovich](../../chr/uljc/index.md), and the derivative work by
[Dowling](../../chr/agjc/index.md). Arthur Lillie here examines possible
historical linkages between the two religions from a critical,
rationalist, viewpoint.

His theory will be thought-provoking for Buddhists and Christians alike.
Lillie explores some of the same issues which John Robertson targets in
[Pagan Christs](../../bib/cv/pch/index.md), particularly the evolution of
sacrificial rites into symbolic forms. He is not a believer in the
historicity of either Jesus or Buddha, and he pokes a lot of holes in
the normative chronology of Buddhism. Lillie is also trying to open up
an additional front here, by attempting to reduce much of Indian
mythology to a multiplication of forms of Shiva. This is a radical view
which blurs some of the efficacy of this book. He also, curiously
enough, ignores the parallels between the Christ and Krishna stories,
which many others have remarked on.

On the whole, this controversial thesis is an enjoyable read, and a rare
attempt by a free-thinker to confront the issue of diffusion of
religious concepts from India to the Near East.

PRODUCTION NOTES: There were a lot of [typographical errors](errata.md) in
this book, which I corrected in the usual fashion. Spelling of
non-English terms was highly inconsistent; and I was careful to
transcribe each variant as it appeared, even if I knew it to be
incorrect. Lastly, there is what appears to be a lacuna of several
paragraphs at pages [231](ipc17.htm#page_231.md) and
[232](ipc17.htm#page_232.md); a numbered list of astrological signs starts
at the latter page with the number 3. I have no explanation for
this.*--J.B. Hare, February 26, 2008*.
