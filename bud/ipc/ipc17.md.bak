### CHAPTER XIV

#### PAULINISM

<span class="small">St. Paul a puzzle—Was he an ascetic mystic, or the
author of the theory of the "Atonement," "Original Sin," etc., in fact
of priestly Christianity?—Up to the date of Irenæus there is no trace of
his writings, nor even of his teachings—Did he convert Peter and James
as described in "The Acts?"—James, Peter, John the Evangelist, and
Matthew all Nazarites,—also Paul—Were they all instrumental in making
the water drinking Essenes drink wine?—Valentinus—"Left-handed
gods"—Early Zodiac of S’iva.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">No</span> problem is so difficult as the
question of the Apostle Paul. Early Christianity; like other religions,
had soon two sections, the religion of the individual and the religion
by body corporate, the religion of the conscience and the religion of
state ceremonial. It has been the fate of St. Paul to figure as the
guiding spirit of both.

There are two Pauls, the one put forth by Catholics as the type of St.
Vincent de Paul and Fénelon, as the ideal of the Christian ascetic. This
Paul states that for the mystical life all men should be celibates. This
Paul spent his life "in watchings often, in hunger, thirst, fastings" (2
Cor. ii. 27); "in tumults in labour, in fastings" (2 Cor. vi. 7). This
Paul states that the spiritual drink of Christians in the Communion
Service should be the water that flowed from the rock of Moses. This
Paul had for motto "Walk in Sophia," a word with mystics for the
interior life. He announces

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

that he had as the resultant "spiritual gifts," "the inspired word,"
"healing," "miracle," "prophecy," the "discerning of spirits" (1 Cor.
xii., *et seq*.). And as a crowning fact this Paul announces that he was
a "Nazarite," separated from his mother's womb, that is, an Eremite
vowed from birth to water drinking and desert communings (Gal. i. 15).
The other Paul is credited with having brought back into religion under
a new form the principle of forgiveness of sins by shedding of blood,
which the Essenes and the Therapeuts were struggling hard to banish. He
invented theories about "redemption," "expiation," "original sin." He
induced the Essene celibates and vegetarian water drinkers to break
their vows. This last feat is the more noticeable as we have seen that
he himself was a Nazarite.

And these difficulties have much increased since modern scholarship has
taken up St. Paul. Dr. Cheyne's "Encyclopædia Biblica" pronounces his
epistles to be all spurious. Mr. W. J. Birch has written a clever book
entitled "Paul an idea, not a Fact," which affirms that his theories are
stolen bodily from Philo. The learned Dr. Giles maintains that there is
no mention of the Pauline epistles in the authentic records of early
Christianity until the date of Irenæus. This he says is very remarkable,
as Justin Martyr can never have heard of them or he would certainly have
used them in his attack on Marcion. Dr. Giles holds that the "most
excellent Theophilus," mentioned by the author of the third Gospel and
the Acts, must have been Theophilus, the sixth Bishop of Antioch, an
opponent of Marcion. Mr. W. Glanville, in a powerful little work, "The
Web Unwoven," has further damaged the Pauline theory. He holds that in
chapters ix., x., xi. of the Acts we get a fictitious narrative intended
to immensely ante-date the rise of what is now called Paulinism.

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

The story there narrated is certainly strange. The Maker of the hundred
million starry systems visits earth in a bodily form to introduce an
exceptional religion. He leaves behind him a trusted agent to carry on
the great enterprise after his death. And yet in a few years this agent
guided chiefly by a "dream" of a heathen, throws over all the
regulations believed to be divine. Mr. Granville points out a certain
shrewdness in the story. Peter is made to go to the house of a tanner,
the most defiling of residences, in the mind of the Jews. The chief
agent of the change, Cornelius, is made a Roman captain that the Roman
magistrates might think that Christianity is an orthodox form of the
Jew's religion, entitled in consequence to State toleration. The date of
this great change is fixed at about the time of James’s martyrdom (44
A.D.). Is there any historical proof that such a change then took place?

Mr. Newman, in his work "James and Paul," maintains that the former was
plainly quite ignorant of what we now call Paulinism:—

In his Epistle "he has nothing about being good for example's sake.
Concerning the Cross, or death, or blood of Christ we gather nothing
from him, nor does Jesus appear as Saviour or Mediator." "It cannot be
discovered that any acts of internal devotion towards Jesus were a part
of James’s religion." <span id="fr_230"></span>[\*](#fn_229.md)

But a passage from Eusebius carries the matter a step further, and shows
that James, like St. Paul, could not have accepted Paulinism without
gross perjury, for he, too, was consecrated from his mother's womb to
the water-drinking life of the Nazarite or Nazareen.

"He was consecrated from his mother's womb. He drank neither wine nor
strong drink, neither ate

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

he any living thing. A razor never went upon his head. He anointed not
himself with oil, nor did he use a bath. He alone was allowed to enter
into the holies. He did not wear woollen garments but linen. And he
alone entered the sanctuary and was found upon his knees praying for the
forgiveness of the people, so that his knees became hard like a camel's
through his constant bending and supplication before God, and asking for
forgiveness of the people." <span id="fr_231"></span>[\*](#fn_230.md)

There is also evidence that St. Peter was a Nazareen ascetic, subsequent
to the dream of the Roman captain, Cornelius.

Says St. Peter in the "Clementine Homilies":—

"However such a choice has occurred to you, perhaps without your
understanding my manner of life that I use only bread and olives and
rarely pot herbs, and this my only coat and cloak which I wear . . . for
those who have determined to accept the blessings of the future reign
have no right to regard as their own the things that are here . . . with
the exception of water and bread, and those things procured with sweat
to maintain life." <span id="fr_232"></span>[†](#fn_231.md)

Epiphanius in commenting on the passage about James in Eusebius, adds
the two sons of Zebedee to the list of water-drinking Nazarites; and
Clement of Alexandria writes thus of St. Matthew:—

"It is far better to be happy than to have a demon dwelling with us. And
happiness is found in the practice of virtue. Accordingly the Apostle
Matthew partook of seeds and nuts and vegetables without flesh."

Up to the second century A.D. the early Christians were called
"Nazareens" or "Nazarites"—Tatian, Tertullian and others treat the two
words as identical.

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Jews, the
Moslem, the East generally, still employ the title Pilate wrote up on
the cross, and all the early disciples were baptised by a Nazarite
separated from his mother's womb. The Essenes and Therapeuts according
to Philo and Josephus drank nothing but water, and we see from my
present chapter that the most prominent of Christ's disciples, St.
James, St. Matthew, St. John and St. Peter were water-drinking
Nazarites, in deed as well as in name. How is it then that the Nazarite
St. John has written a gospel which proclaims—according to its modern
interpreters in Rome and Lambeth—that unless a Christian drinks wine at
least once a year he will be punished everlastingly in the flames of
hell. And the Nazarite St. Paul backs up the Nazarite St. John with an
account—the earliest according to scholars—of the institution of the
Sacrament of bread and wine by Jesus, an account which the Nazarite St.
Matthew has copied into his gospel. All this points to a wholesale
falsification rather than the chance modifications of a few zealous
copyists. Irenæus, who first mentions the Fourth Gospel, tells us that
it was the special gospel of the followers of Valentinus. Was he the
falsifier?

This question will have to be probed from many points of view. One
statement of Tertullian may here be mentioned. He announces that the
Valentinians maintained that it was necessary to worship the
"left-handed" deities <span id="fr_233"></span>[\*](#fn_232.md) as well as
the right-handed. Here we have the Vâmâcharîs of S’iva. These
"left-handed" deities, were on the left side of the Zodiac.

I tried to show in an early work, "Buddha and Early Buddhism," that
almost every mansion in the Buddhist Zodiac seemed intentionally to
suggest the two great Serpents, the Father and the Mother. This

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

fact if it could be established, would be of far greater importance now
that we are considering S’iva Buddha.

Fig. 1 [Plate 17](#img_pl17.md) is S’iva's Trisula. Outside of India it is
called the Rod of Hermes. It is the holiest symbol of Buddhism, Mani,
the Pearl.

Om Mani Padme Hum.

This Trisula of S’iva is everywhere. It is conspicuous on the summit of
the great Sanchi Tope (Fig 3). It makes up the conventional head of
Buddha (Fig. 4). It is on a charm in Tibet (Fig. 2). We see from the
Catacombs the meaning of the descending dove (Fig. 5). Now this outline
is plainly to be seen in the Crab, the Scorpion, the Taurine or Bull,
and also the Scales which according to Ptolemy are simply the claws of
the Scorpion. <span id="fr_234"></span>[\*](#fn_233.md) Then the Serpent is
certainly suggested in the tail of the Lion, and the trunk of the
Elephant (Capricorn). An elephant and a serpent have the same name in
Sanskrit—Naga. Here we get eight serpent symbols, but two I completely
overlooked in my early work. For the Twins (they are male and female in
India), I give a design which I took from some Buddhist sculptures,
given in the "Tree and Serpent Worship" of Mr. Fergusson, the male twin
holds up a lotus (See Indian Zodiac ([Plate 18](#img_pl18).md) in next
page). Plainly the outline purposely makes the head of a cobra, an
Indian virile symbol. That I have not made a mistake is evident, for the
same outline is repeated in the hand of Virgo, who again is S’iva the
great Father-Mother. For the Ram there is a horse with two snakes on his
head. <span id="fr_235"></span>[†](#fn_234.md) It is also from Fergusson's
"Tree and Serpent Worship." In the Indian epic the Mahabharata there is
an episode, the "Churning

<span id="img_pl17"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![PLATE 17.&lt;br&gt;

of the Ocean." Almost all mythical poetry in all languages is a mixing
up of astronomical signs, kaleidoscopical fashion. In this little story
Nârayana, to gain for mortals the amrita or immortal drink, coils the
Serpent Vâsukhi (the ecliptic) round the Mountain Mandar (the Kosmos)
and makes it spin round and "churn" the ocean (unfashioned fluidic
matter). In this little story the signs of the Zodiac are brought in a
little clumsily.

The sign for the fish is Chakra.

What is Chakra?

The little myth, the Churning of the Ocean, answers the question.

"Beneath the trenchant Chakra he saw guarding the Amrita two immense and
terrible serpents, strong, venom-darting, with fiery eyes and throats,
and tongues of forked lightning." <span id="fr_236"></span>[\*](#fn_235.md)

Here is another passage:—

"Here dwell two serpents the terror of enemies Arvouda and Sakravapi.
Here are the sublime palaces of Swastika and Maninâga." <span
id="fr_237"></span>[†](#fn_236.md)

Plainly Chakra, the Fish of the Zodiac, is the wheel called Swastika in
India, <span id="fr_238"></span>[‡](#fn_237.md) and Cancer the Serpents of
the mani or pearl. And the palaces of these two are the black and white
halves of the Zodiac.

It is, oddly enough, the only cross in the catacombs, and it was the
only symbol on the drapery of the high altar when the Japanese
constructed a model Japanese temple in Knightsbridge a few years ago. It
is called the "Seal of the heart of Buddha."

In the Rig Veda, India's terrible Vajra or bolt is called Chaturasri
(the four angled). This is plainly the Swastika.

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

\(3\) *The Twins*. This is the Sowing Festival, the Epoch of the Lesser
Mysteries. Buddha, Rama, Krishna and the Sons of Pandu, of the
Mahabharata, marry now, after showing their animal strength at its
culminating point at Olympian games. Rama bends the bow of S’iva, a
constellation that is shining at midnight at this very moment. The
Asvins or Twins are sometimes male and female in the Rig Veda. Plainly
if the S’ivan designs on the punch marked coins are zodiacal, we get
here the "Jew's harp." It explains the splendid bas relief of the
Marriage of S’iva and Durga at Elora. Opposite this marriage is "the
Bow" in the sky, Life confronted with Death.

\(4\) *The Crab*. This is plainly the Maninaga of the Mahabharata,
S’iva's Trisula, the trident which heads the yogi's staff as he treads
along the mystical "way." Opposite is Gaṇes’a, the Elephant, the
definite God, detaching himself from the Great Fish in the Great Ocean.

\(5\) *The Lion*. This is Durga's carrier, and her pet sign. The two
together form the Sphinx, the great enigma which man must guess to live.
Buddha on the lion throne near the tree of Knowledge was guessing it.
Lions and sphinxes abound in Elora, and other rock cut temples.

\(6\) *Virgo*. We now come to the Virgin of the Sky, the "Mother who
delivers the World" as the Buddhists call her, the much abused Durgâ who
gave agriculture to Greece and Babylon, and sent her son Ganes’a to give
it to the Romans. To this day she presides at the Festival of Plenty in
India, and the Brahmin polytheists and her other theological opponents
crowd to it quite as eagerly as her own votaries. Her symbol is also a
tree—the tree of the ascetic.

\(7\) *Libra* is the Firebird and probably the dismembered S’iva. S’iva,
Indra, Osiris, Saturn, were

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

all dismembered; and Durgâ in the Mysteries wailed and made the temples
resound with her grief that the Kosmos had lost its productive energy.
The legend of the flying Mahadeo burning up the Tripura, the three
cities (Earth, Kailas, and Pandemonium) means a starving Kosmos.

\(8\) *Scorpio*. It is plain, too, also, that Scorpio, or S’iva as
Bhairava with a gaping mouth that breathes out flames, is the same
destructive energy. He is the Ialdibaoth of the Gnostics, the
inexplicable confusion in the world's harmony.

\(9\) *Sagittarius*. This sign is called the "Bow of S’iva" in the
Ramâyâna, and the young Râma is the only competitor at the jousts that
can bend it. The arrows that fly from that bow become serpents and kill
their foes, and then return to the sender.

\(10\) *Capricorn*. The zodiacal signs sometimes represent the sun-god
in his annual cruise, and sometimes his victims. Durga kills
Mahishasura, and S’iva kills an elephant named Gaya, he kills Kama (the
Twins, the erotic principle), he kills Tripurasura (the Brahmanic
hierarchy figuring as Scorpio), he dominates the serpent that is sent
against him and the antelope (Aries) and seizes the Dwarf's "Club"
(Virgo, the Tree), and he smashes the head of his own son, being angry
that he was born as an elephant. Then, by a clumsy myth, he restores him
to life, but the head being smashed an elephant's head had to be
substituted. The Elephant represents the Holy Spirit in India. The
Indian sign for Capricorn is an elephant emerging from a Makara, the
definite from the chaotic, the Buddhist Padmapâni and the S’ivan Ganes’a
from Îswara the Unthinkable.

The last two signs, the Yogi with the pot of immortal food (Aquarius)
and the Chakra of Dharma (Pisces), terminate the career of the ideal
man. At first the entanglements of the animal life—and then dream-

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

land with its angels and hobgoblins, and the crucial puzzle of all
philosophies and all religions, the origin of evil. The yogis of S’iva
and Buddha when first united must have had many such dreams before the
Cosmism of the Nirisvara school swamped up the Aiswarikas. I mention
this here because in treating S’iva-Buddhism I am forced to consider
chiefly the side that it shows to the world.
