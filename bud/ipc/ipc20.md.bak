### CHAPTER XVII

#### ALEXANDRIA

<span class="small">Adi Buddha described by Hodgson—Abrasax described by
Matter—Close points of contact—Mithras—His death and burial at
Easter—Abrasax an individual, and also the whole body of the faithful,
like Sangha, and also St. Paul's "Christ"—Points of contact between
Kattragam and the Logos of Philo—Abrasax has two serpent legs—So has
Padmapâni in the sculptures of Jemalgiri—Close analogies between
Sekkraia and Serapis—Each is half man, half stone—Description of the
advent of the Son of Man in the Gospels, quite different from what was
expected, but quite in harmony with S’iva's Pralaya.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">I will</span> open this chapter with a
noteworthy description of the Supreme Buddha as conceived in the
Buddhist books that came from Nalanda to Nepal. It is given to us by
Brian Hodgson. I will then quote what Matter tells us of the God of
Basilides. Linked together, the passages read curiously.

According to Hodgson the Buddhists hold that "Ishwara, the Supreme God,
the Absolute, is Nirvritti, and Nirvritti is this: to know the world to
be a mere semblance, unreal, and an illusion,—and to know God to be one,
and Pravritti to be the opposite of this sublime science, and in fact
the practice and notions of ordinary men. Therefore, according to
Nirvritti Adi Buddha is the author and creator of all things, without
whom nothing can be done, whose care sustains the world and its
inhabitants, and the moment he averts his face from them they become
annihilated, and nothing remains but himself." <span
id="fr_268"></span>[\*](#fn_267.md)

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

Now from Matter we learn that the God of Basilides was "unborn,
unmanifested, nameless—He who hides himself in the plenitude of his
perfections."

When he manifests these they take the form of countless beings, all
analogous to himself. Each of these is not a mythical fancy without
substance. Each is really God; and without him they and their worlds
fade away into nothingness.

In connection with these emanations, Matter details what he considers a
curious piece of letter puzzle, the "Abrasax." These letters make up
three hundred and sixty-five, and Abrasax is the God that rules the
Pleroma, the manifested world, the Indian Pravritti, as distinguished
from the unmanifested, the Gnostic Buthos, the Indian Nirvritti. Abrasax
is plainly the year-god.

In this letter puzzle the mightiest mysteries were said to be
concealed. <span id="fr_269"></span>[\*](#fn_268.md)

Matter tells us also that Μειθρας, the Persian Buddhist divinity, has a
name whose Greek letters also make up three hundred and sixty-five, and
who is also called the "Word." Tertullian said of this god that it
imitated the "Mystery" of the Resurrection. Fermicus, a Christian
controversialist who lived in the fourth century, tells us what that
"mystery" was. Every year Mithras was supposed to die at Easter. In the
form of a stone he was buried with great pomp in a cave. Then in a day
or two he rose again with much rejoicings and illuminations.

But the most important of the ideas recorded by Matter as held by
Basilides, I take to be this:—That Abrasax was at once a single divine
being, and also the entire body of the Emanations that were manifested
(la totalité des intelligences qui composent le Pleroma). <span
id="fr_270"></span>[\*](#fn_268.md) Does not this bring strangely together
the Buddhist and the Christian Vice-God? Sangha

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

also is at once one individual and all the congregation of faithful
souls. And St. Paul held the same idea that the "Christ" was the body of
all the faithful:—

"For in him the Pleroma of Divinity wholly dwelleth" (Col. ii. 9).

Whilst Christianity remained Jewish all art illustration was impossible,
as Mr. King in his "Gnostics" points out. This gives an importance to
the Gnostic gems which filtered in as talismans.

Matter tells us the certain stones (les pierres de Basilides) were
viewed with special importance. These are plainly what in England we
call the "Gnostic Gems."

[Plate 24](#img_pl24.md) gives some of the most important.

They throw much light on our special subject.

Epiphanius tells us that certain "heretics" even in his day had a god
with serpent legs, "and they called it Abrasax." Tertullian also attacks
certain Christians "who have taken unto themselves gods with wings, or
with the heads of dogs, or of lions or serpents from the legs
downwards."

Basilides died A.D. 136, and Epiphanius lived about A.D. 400, so Abrasax
(see , fig. 1) must have been the symbolised representation of the
manifested Supreme, the Logos, for a considerable time.

"Philo," says Keim, "described his god as a simple entity. He disclaimed
for him every name, every quality, even that of the Good, the Beautiful,
the Blessed, the One. Since he is still better than the good and higher
than the Unity, he can never be known as—but only that he is. His
perfect name is only the four mysterious letters J. H. V. H.—that is
pure being. It was the problem of theology as well as religion to shed
the light of God upon the world and lead it again to God. But how could
this being which was veiled from the world be brought to bear upon it.
By Philo, as well as by all the philosophy

<span id="img_pl24"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![PLATE 24.&lt;br&gt;
GNOSTIC GEMS.](tn/pl24.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/pl24.jpg.md)  
PLATE 24.

</span>

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

of the time, the problem could only be solved illogically. Yet by
modifying his exalted nature it might be done. If not by his being, yet
by his work, he influences the world. His powers, his angels, all in it
that is best and mightiest, the instrument, the interpreter, the
mediator and messenger of God, his pattern and first-born, the Son of
God, the Second God, even God himself, the divine Word is Logos,
communicate with the world." <span id="fr_271"></span>[\*](#fn_269.md)

The popular idea is that Philo got all his ideas about the Logos from
Plato, but in Alexandria at Philo's date there were ideas added that
could not have come from that source. The Yoga S’âstra of Patanjali was
the chief Bible of the Mahayana Buddhists as we have seen, and in that
work the inconceivable, the Great Absolute, took no interest in mortal
affairs. This doctrine was transferred to Alexandria, and even to the
Christians for a French wit has styled Tertullian's "Placid" God a "Dieu
inutile"; but Plato's rigid logic would not probably accept such a God,
for if we can know nothing about the Great Absolute, how can we know
that he takes no interest in mortal affairs? Then again the Word by the
Gnostic Kabbalists was practically interpreted to mean the letters
J.H.V.H., made into a divine being. This was plainly derived from the
A.U.M. of the Yoga S’âstra. A third question that arises is this—Did
Philo know anything of the Cingalese god Kattragam, and had Kattragam
(or Kârttikeya) connection with the Gnostic time god, Abrasax.
Kârttikeya as the God of War was very popular in Ceylon for the seaman
Knox tells us that the shrines of the Dewales bristled with weapons, but
the Wiharas were quite without them.

Kattragam (like Abrasax) used the cock for a symbol. It figured on his
banner. His temple was more

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

honoured than the wihara erected for the worship performed by the King.
He received from Buddha the chief power to cure the sick, "especially
those of royal blood"; also to perform miracles; to assist men in
distress; and to do good to animals. Once a year he had in Ceylon a
magnificent festival. All Ceylon assembled, and also Hindus from the
Malabar and the Coromandel Coasts. On the tallest of elephants, seated
in an ivory howdah profusely be-gemmed, the god passed along,
accompanied by drums, and lighted torches. The festival lasted fifteen
days. Then with much mystery a golden sword was carried in a palanquin
to the nearest river to "cut the water" (arrest its flow). The gold
sword was apparently as much honoured as the god, and was carried back
carefully to the Temple. <span id="fr_272"></span>[\*](#fn_270.md) This
gold sword explains much of the popular enthusiasm for Kattragam.
Ignorant natives, in abject terror of the thousands of evil spirits
around them, would seek a protection in the gold sword. As it is stated,
that Kattragam was the Son of S’iva and his wife Pattinee or Durgâ and
was, moreover, the God of War, what better safety?

Now Abrasax and Padmapani, the Buddhist "Præsens Divus" according to
Hodgson, <span id="fr_273"></span>[†](#fn_271.md) have each two serpents
for legs. (See Fig. 2, [Pl. 24](#img_pl24.md) of Padmapani, taken from a
bas relief of the sculptures of Jemalgiri). And the ritual . of the
followers of S’iva, when scrambling for the flesh and blood of S’iva as
the dying year, seems certainly to have reached the Buddhists, for we
find this amongst Hodgson's quotations:— <span
id="fr_274"></span>[‡](#fn_272.md)

"From between his (Padma Pani's) shoulders sprang Brahma, from his
forehead Mahâdeva, from his two eyes the sun and moon, from his mouth
the

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

air, from his teeth Sarasvatî," and so on and so on. <span
id="fr_275"></span>[\*](#fn_273.md) Remember that from the belly of the
S’ivan Victim sprang the Serpent King. Abrasax was certainly two
serpents from the belly downwards.

Let us now compare Kattragam and the Logos.

"The Logos is the son of God the Father," says Philo (De Profugis).
Kattragam is also the Son of God, the God whose followers started all
the subtleties about the Logos.

"The Logos is superior to all the Angels" (De Profugis) .

Kattragam as the god of war commands all the Devas.

"The Logos is the Physician that heals all evil." Kattragam in Ceylon is
the chief healer as well as the chief fighter, practically identical
functions when healing means battling with evil spirits. Hence the
importance of Kattragam's gold sword, and the big shield of Abrasax.

Says Philo:—"The just man when he dies is translated to another state by
the Logos, by whom the world was created; for God by his said Logos, by
which he made all things, will raise the perfect man from the dregs of
this world, and exalt him near himself." (De Sacrificüs).

Abrasax has a whip, which makes him the Lord of Hell and supreme judge.
The Christos of the Gnostics had the same function. Also he brought not
peace but a sword, and could summon more than twelve legions of angels.

All this sheds a flood of light upon the Gnosticism of Alexandria. It
was Buddhism filtered through the Kappooism of Ceylon. Samana Deva Rajah
and his Nâgas is reproduced in Ialdibaoth, a serpent God with his seven
serpent-headed sons. Then the Goddess Pattinee is equally prominent. It
was the aim of Philo, one of the Gnostics, ever to be the "Servant

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

of Sophia," the inspirer of all that is good. The most holy book of the
Alexandrine version of the scriptures is called "The Book of Wisdom."
(Sophia), in the same way that the tractates of the higher mysticism of
the Buddhists are called Prajñâ Pâramitâ, the "Wisdom of the other
Bank."

But Pattinee is also the Gorgon, a popular Gnostic gem. She is the
Serpentine Durgâ.

Another plagiarism is noteworthy. Sekkraia, the god, half stone, half
man, sits on his stone in one of Mr. Upham's drawings, and has in his
hand a cup of wine. Now the chief god of Alexandria was Serapis, and his
conventional head ([Pl. 24](#img_pl24), Fig. 4.md) is crowned with a wine
cup and tree markings, the wine of the Tavateinza Tree. His hair is a
coiled serpent.

This gives a meaning to one of the most popular of Gnostica mulets. Here
is Sekkraia, the god, half man, half stone. In the mysticism of the
Kabbala the "Cup of Libation" designates the fourth or highest grade in
the progress of the mystic. Some trace a version of this idea in the
legend of the Sangreal. Another gem (, Fig. 3) shows the god half man,
half stone, still more clearly. He figures as a King and also a Yogi.
King's "Gnostics" gives several specimens of this design. Each has the
long hair of the Yogi and the Nazarite. Each has a beard; each also has
his arms crossed. Mr. King dates the rise of Serapis from the building
of Alexandria. The earliest statue—that at Sinope—had Proserpine (Durgâ)
for his wife. Serapis has two faces like S’iva in India, and Janus at
Rome. He was called Soter (the Saviour), as Tertullian <span
id="fr_276"></span>[\*](#fn_274.md) tells us, for he healed body and soul.
But Mr. King says that in his earliest form he was the Lord of Hell, and
Judge of the dead; these conflicting functions have been worked into
Christianity. Tertullian talks of the

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "three natures" of
Soter. The gems throw a light on this. Fig. 6 gives plainly the Trinity
of S’iva-Buddhism One—the Yogi with a beard (Tertullian's "Unmanifested
Supreme"). Two—the wife, the Buddhist Dharma, the Gnostic Sophia; and
the third emblem is the Elephant with the Rod of Hermes, two Symbols of
the Spiritual life. Fig. 5 makes this still more plain. Here we see the
Elephant, like Buddha, coming from Nirvritti to the manifested
[Pleroma](errata.htm#34.md).

Herodotus, who speaks in a very circumstantial manner of the deities,
and of the religion of the Egyptians, makes no mention of Serapis, His
worship was not introduced to Rome until 146 A.D. Serapis is described
as a sort of Jupiter-Æsculapius. In the second century his temples in
Egypt, called Serapes, numbered forty-three, at which great cures were
effected. His symbol was the Serpent, and he was pronounced one of the
infernal gods; and Jacobi in the "Dictionnaire Mythologique" says that
his statue, which Ptolemy replaced with that of Sinope, was a block of
granite rough and formless.

And the reader will perhaps remember Gibbon's account of the Serapion at
Alexandria whose pompous colonnades, upraised on a vast artificial mound
one hundred steps above the city, glittered with golden statues like the
Mahâdewayo Vihara in Ceylon; and possessed "arches, vaults, and
subterranean apartments," <span id="fr_277"></span>[\*](#fn_275.md)
presided over by the goddess Anaitis, the special patroness of the
Brides of the God. <span id="fr_278"></span>[†](#fn_276.md)

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

At Sinope, an early statue of Serapis with three heads marked the rise
of the Nile, and also, like Trailinga Is’wara, the Past, the Present and
the Future.

Mr. Moncure Conway, commenting on the exceptional concealments of the
body of Serapis, likens them to similar veilings when the body of the
Bambino of Aracœli is exhibited. But the mythology of Ceylon
sufficiently explains the matter. If a portion of the body of a god is
sometimes of flesh and sometimes of stone it would not do to show too
much of him. <span id="fr_279"></span>[\*](#fn_277.md)

The ideas which we call Messianic, which were in existence just before
the epoch of Christianity, were derived from many sources. From the
prophet Micah, the Jews had been taught to expect an earthly conqueror,
who was to destroy all the enemies of Israel and to set up the Chosen
Race upon the "Mountain of the Lord" resplendent with the "gains" (Micah
iv. 13) of his conquests. This Messiah was certainly a man, for
according to Daniel he was to be cut off. Then came the influence of a
very old Persian book, the Bundahesh. In it Soshios or Soshyans comes
with his angels to effect a general resurrection, and to send the wicked
to eternal suffering with Ahriman in hell. <span
id="fr_280"></span>[†](#fn_278.md)

A work, the "Apocryphal Book of Enoch" seems a version of this work
Judaised, with Jehovah for Ormuzd and Satan for Ahriman. A similar
resurrection and a judgment is there described, but Soshios is an angel,
and the leader of the heavenly host in the "Book of Enoch" is Jehovah in
one part of the book, and "Messiah," the "Son of Man" in another. This
work is quoted by St. Jude, and it was viewed as part of Scripture by
Tertullian. <span id="fr_281"></span>[‡](#fn_279.md)

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

A fifth influence must be mentioned, overlooked for a long time, but now
held by scholars to have had great influence with the Gnostic societies
at that time abundant.

"Five hundred years Ânanda," said Buddha, in the Culavagga, "will the
doctrine of the Truth abide." <span id="fr_282"></span>[\*](#fn_280.md) It
is urged that this prophecy must have excited the Gnostics, for Buddha's
death is fixed at 477 B.C., and a new Buddha would be due exactly at the
time of the coming of Christ. Now it is a noteworthy fact that each of
these five descriptions is radically unlike the "Coming of the Son of
Man" as depicted in the three first gospels. For his coming was to
effect a complete destruction of the earth, and the million billion
star-systems of the Kosmos:—

"The sun shall be darkened and the moon shall no more give her light,
and the stars in heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven
shall be shaken" (Mark xiii. 25).

Heaven and earth were to pass away, and a new heaven and a new earth
were to come down from heaven. Under such circumstances all the
descriptions of eternal punishment in a cave under the earth with
Ahriman or Satan must be more recent additions. If the Son of Man of the
Gospels were really to come as described, there would be no Cave in the
centre of the earth, no Satan, no wicked at all, and the verse in Mark
more than implies that the celestial cohorts would have come to an end.
It is true that these descriptions in modern pulpits are made to refer
to the taking of Jerusalem, on the strength of an
[interpolated](errata.htm#35.md) passage in Luke, but that is quite
irrational. The epistles, which were much earlier than the Gospels,
announce that the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved at the coming
of the day of God (2 Peter iii. 12).

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> That phenomenon
was not observed at the taking of Jerusalem.

Now if we turn to the Buddhism of Ceylon we may find a possible
explanation:—

It was believed that S’iva at stated periods effected the complete
destruction of the Kosmos, and annihilated both men and gods. Then he
created a new Kosmos. This idea had come on to S’iva-Buddhism.

In the Mahâwanso "Kappos" (Kalpas, Sansk.) are constantly mentioned,
periodical destructions that come like a thief in the night. Their
arrival, says Mr. Turner, can be no more calculated upon than a man can
guess how many mustard seeds there are in a mountain one yogana in
height made up entirely of mustard seeds. <span
id="fr_283"></span>[\*](#fn_281.md)

"It," says Mr. Upham, writing of Ceylon Buddhism, "is philosophically
described as a circle. The universe arises in beauty and excellence, and
enjoys a golden age of excellence and peace. It deteriorates as it
passes through a determinate series of changes from its brightness and
glory; the stature of its inhabitants diminishes; and the perfection of
its fruits and every other natural quality become proportionately
lessened and impoverished by stated degrees, until the arrival of the
period of their destruction, for which three agents are periodically
assigned, namely fire, water and wind. Each of these causes has its
exact limits. The last is the final and grand cataclysm, which sweeps
the whole system into general destruction." <span
id="fr_284"></span>[†](#fn_282.md)

Matter believes that the chief battle in the early stages of
Christianity was between the Old Testament dualism derived by the Jews
from Persia, and Gnosticism. It was said of Basilides that he made the
devil a divinity. Readers of this work will see the falsehood

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

of this: indeed, Matter refutes it from the Gnostic's own writings. But
much of the Christianity of the priest, which was totally different to
the Christianity of Christ, seems to be a compromise between these two
antagonistic forces. The fate of the wicked, as I have shown, to be
confined for ever and ever with Ahriman in the flames of hell, would be
an impossibility to Basilides, who believed that the Supreme God burnt
up the systems from time to time. On the other hand the idea of two
omnipotent gods, different and yet the same, one-half much concerned
for, and the other entirely callous to, the fate of mankind their
offspring, which is the basis of the Logos and also the Trinity idea,
would be pronounced utterly irrational except in regions where the
philosophy of the followers of S’iva prevailed.

In point of fact, an atmosphere of Cingalese Buddhism was battling with
Jewish influences in those early Christian days. Take the ideas
concerning the punishment of the wicked and the rewards of the just.
Each of these is now held to be eternal; but in one passage of scripture
Satan and the sinners are described as being shut up in the fiery pit
for a thousand years. Also the bliss of the just in the new Jerusalem,
like that of saintly natives of Ceylon in the palaces of Tavateinza, is
also limited to "reign with Christ a thousand years."

Another point seems to connect Alexandria and Ceylon—the action of
"devils" in causing disease, and the action of the disciples of Serapis
and Jesus in curing it. Tertullian, in speaking of the first, says that
they "inflict on the body diseases and many grievous mishaps, and
violently visit the man with sudden and extraordinary aberrations."

And he says of the healers they are "Sorcerers also truly in respect to
the cure of diseases," and that they often cause the diseases magically
before they

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

proceed to cure them. <span id="fr_285"></span>[§](#fn_283.md) In St.
Luke's Gospel (x. 17) we learn the great success of the seventy who were
sent forth to "heal the sick."

A passage from Professor Harnack may be here cited, dealing with
Christian times.

"The whole world and the circumambient atmosphere were filled with
devils. Not merely idolatry, but every phase and form of life was ruled
by them. They sat on thrones. They hovered around cradles. The earth was
literally a hell, though it was and continued to be, a Creation of
God." <span id="fr_286"></span>[\*](#fn_284.md)

A graver point is the question of sex. The women of the Nicolaites, the
Prodiciens, the Carpocratiens and others, proclaimed that the laws of
chastity were not binding; and an influential female leader, a woman
named Agape, enunciated ideas very similar to those current in a temple
of S’iva; and she persuaded a large bevy of Agapetes to become in all
innocence and zeal "Brides of the God." <span
id="fr_287"></span>[†](#fn_285.md)

One point more. It was held in Ceylon that between the earth and Mienmo
the fabled holy peak, corresponding to the Jewish Zion and the Greek
Olympus, were millions of Spirits. The space was called the "Jugandere."
Had these spirits any affinity with those of the Archon of St. Paul
(Eph. ii. 2) who had the domination of the air. Hippolytus tells us that
the Great Archon, Abrasax, had three hundred and sixty-five
heavens. <span id="fr_288"></span>[‡](#fn_286.md)
