<span class="smallcaps">In</span> Buddha Gaya, in the year B.C. 520,
Buddha sat under a pippala tree dreaming of a Dharma Râj. We have all
our visions at times of this Dharma Râj, a bright kingdom of Dreamland
where wrong is righted; but who, like Buddha, sees his dream made
concrete?

Buddha sat under the renowned *Ficus religiosa*, B.C. 520. Two hundred
and fifty years after this appeared King Asoka and the Dharma Râj.

Asoka, at the age of twenty-four, succeeded to the throne of Patna. His
brothers raised troops, and sought to upset him. After a sharp struggle
he overcame them, and treated them with the [usual](errata.htm#13.md) mercy
of Asiastics towards brothers near the throne. He was the grandson of
Sandrocottus, who was placed on the throne by Brahmin intrigue. Asoka
was at first a pious Brahmin, and 50,000 Brahmins were fed by him daily.
Also he was a capable soldier, for he conquered more Indian territory
than Clive, Lake, Wellington, and Napier, if they were to sum up the
area of their united conquests.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

But after his consecration he had several conversations with a Buddhist
monk named Nigrauda. Much interested in Buddha, he received eagerly the
details of his life and teaching. Soon the King was converted, and he
made Buddhism the State religion.

Shortly before this, according to the calculations of Sir Alexander
Cunningham and Professor Max Müller, India received the letters of the
alphabet. The gift was happily timed, because the first use made of it
was to scratch ideas on rocks and stones. In the year B.C. 251 King
Asoka incised his earliest rock edict. He soon issued a great many more.
Some idea of the extent of the rule and the spread of Buddhism may be
gained from the fact that on the extreme west of India he cut a rock
inscription at Girnar on the Gulf of Cutch. On the east coast, at
Ganjam, were the Dhauli and Jaugada edicts; and Gandhara, or Peshawur,
was reached in the north; and Chola and Pandiya, the extreme southern
provinces of India, as I have said before.

It was a fortunate circumstance that the rude expedient was adopted of
cutting the edicts on stone, because innovators cannot treat stone
edicts like manuscripts on plantain leaves; and we get at once an
opportunity of finding out at least what Buddha's disciples thought
about God, spirit, and man's future.

#### KING ASOKA'S IDEAS ABOUT GOD.

"Much longing after the things (of this life) is a disobedience, I again
declare; not less so is the laborious ambition of dominion by a prince
who would be a propitiator of heaven. Confess and believe in God
(Is’ana), who is the worthy object of obedience. For equal to this
(belief), I declare unto you, ye shall not find such a means of
propitiating heaven. Oh strive ye to obtain this inestimable
treasure." <span id="fr_58"></span>[\*](#fn_58.md)

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

"Thus spake King Devanampiya Piyadasi: The present moment and the past
have departed under the same ardent hopes. How by the conversion of the
Royal born may religion be increased? Through the conversion of the
lowly born if religion thus increaseth, by how much (more) through the
conviction of the high born and their conversion shall religion
increase? Among whomsoever the name of God resteth, verily this is
religion.

"Thus spake Devanampiya Piyadasi: Wherefore from this very hour I have
caused religious discourses to be preached. I have appointed religious
observances that mankind, having listened thereto, shall be brought to
follow in the right path, and give glory to God." <span
id="fr_59"></span>[\*](#fn_59.md)

"It is well known, sirs, to what lengths have gone my respect for and
faith in Buddha, Dharma, Sangha." <span id="fr_60"></span>[†](#fn_60.md)

"Whatever words have been spoken by the divine Buddha, they have all
been well said." <span id="fr_61"></span>[‡](#fn_61.md)

"And he who acts in conformity with this edict shall be united with
Sugato." <span id="fr_62"></span>[§](#fn_62.md)

"The white elephant whose name is The Bringer of Happiness to the Whole
World." <span id="fr_63"></span>[+](#fn_63.md)

Is’ana is the name that has been selected by the Sanskrit scholars
employed lately in translating "God save the Queen." Buddha, Dharma, and
Sangha make up the Buddhist Trinity, which is precisely similar to that
of Philo and the Gnostics. Buddha is spirit; Dharma, matter; Sangha,
ideal humanity, the Christ. They figure together as three separate
beings in the [sculptures](errata.htm#14.md) of Buddha Gaya, one of Asoka's
temples. Later on they got also to mean Buddha, his law and his monks.

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

#### ASOKA ON A FUTURE LIFE.

"On the many beings over whom I rule I confer happiness in this world;
in the next they may obtain Swarga (paradise)." <span
id="fr_64"></span>[\*](#fn_64.md)

"This is good. With these means let a man seek Swarga. This is to be
done. By these means it is to be done, as by them Swarga (paradise) is
to be gained." <span id="fr_65"></span>[†](#fn_65.md)

"I pray with every variety of prayer for those who differ with me in
creed, that they, following after my example, may with me attain unto
eternal salvation." <span id="fr_66"></span>[‡](#fn_66.md)

"And whoso doeth this is blessed of the inhabitants of this world; and
in the next world endless moral merit resulteth from such religious
charity." <span id="fr_67"></span>[§](#fn_67.md)

"Unto no one can be repentance and peace of mind until he hath obtained
supreme knowledge, perfect faith, which surmounteth all obstacles, and
perpetual assent." <span id="fr_68"></span>[+](#fn_68.md)

"In the tenth year of his anointment, the beloved King Piyadasi obtained
the Sambodhi, or complete knowledge." <span
id="fr_69"></span>[\*\*](#fn_69.md)

"All the heroism that Piyadasi, the beloved of the gods, has exhibited
is in view of another life. Earthly glory brings little profit, but, on
the contrary, produces a loss of virtue. To toil for heaven is difficult
to peasant and to prince, unless by a supreme effort he gives up
all." <span id="fr_70"></span>[††](#fn_70.md)

"May they (my loving subjects) obtain happiness in this world and in the
next." <span id="fr_71"></span>[‡‡](#fn_71.md)

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

"The beloved of the gods speaketh thus: It is more than thirty-two years
and a half that I am a hearer of the law, and I did not exert myself
strenuously; but it is a year or more that I have entered the community
of ascetics, and that I have exerted myself strenuously. Those gods who
during this time were considered to he true gods in Jambudvipa have now
been abjured A small man who exerts himself somewhat can gain for
himself great heavenly bliss, and for this purpose this sermon has been
preached. Both great ones and small ones should exert themselves, and
should in the end gain (true) knowledge. And this manner of acting
should be what? Of long duration! For the spiritual good will grow the
growth, and will grow exceedingly; at least it will grow one size and a
half.

"This sermon has been preached by the departed."

"Two hundred and fifty years have elapsed since the departure of the
teacher." <span id="fr_72"></span>[\*](#fn_72.md)

#### MYSTICISM.

Did early Buddhism "relegate mysticism to the region of fairy-tales," as
Professor Rhys Davids has asserted?

"There is no such charity as the charity which springeth from virtue
(Dharma), which is the intimate knowledge of virtue (Dharma), the
inheritance of virtue (Dharma), the close union with virtue
(Dharma)." <span id="fr_73"></span>[†](#fn_73.md)

"The beloved of the gods, King Piyadasi, honours all forms of religious
faith, whether professed by ascetics (pavajitani) or householders
(gahthani). <span id="fr_74"></span>[‡](#fn_74.md)

"Whatever villages with their inhabitants may be given or maintained for
the sake of the worship,

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

the devotees shall receive the same; and for an example unto my people,
they shall exercise solitary austerities." <span
id="fr_75"></span>[\*](#fn_75.md)

"And he who acts in conformity with this edict shall be united with
Sugato." <span id="fr_76"></span>[†](#fn_76.md)

"Dharma" has been translated "the Law," "Virtue," "Thought,"
"Righteousness," by various scholars. Let the Buddhists give their own
translation in their ritual. "I salute that Dharma who is Prajna
Paramita (the Wisdom of the Other Bank)." <span
id="fr_77"></span>[‡](#fn_77.md)

Now, it seems easy for bishops and Boden Professors of Sanskrit to
explain away Buddha. Says Sir Monier Williams, "He was an atheist." He
"professed to know nothing of spirit as distinct from bodily organism."
He had "no religion" (p. 28); "no prayers" (p. 28); no "Idea of original
sin" (p. 114). He had no real morality, merely "monk morality" (p. 125).
He "could not inculcate piety" (p. 124). All these statements may be and
are accepted by many readers, but how are we to explain away Asoka, a
king who professed to be specially Buddha's pupil; and who by the aid of
a chisel and hard stone has placed beyond a doubt what he thought upon
the subject of Buddha's religion. Could Cartouche build up a Fenelon?
Could a Wilberforce develop himself prompted chiefly by a robust
admiration of the president of the Hell-Fire Club?

It may be confidently affirmed that there is nothing in the world's
history like the Dharma Raj of King Asoka. Imagine Napoleon and Fenelon
rolled into one. He antedates Wilberforce in the matter of slavery. He
antedates Howard in his humanity towards prisoners. He antedates Tolstoi
in his desire to turn the sword into a pruning-hook. He antedates

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rousseau, St.
Martin, Fichte, in their wish to make interior religion the all in all.

Here are two passages from his edicts that go beyond anything to be seen
in any modern State:—

"Piyadasi, the friend of the Devas, attaches less importance to alms and
outside rites than to his desire to witness the spread of interior
religion." <span id="fr_78"></span>[\*](#fn_78.md)

"Progress in Dharma may be obtained in two manners—by formal rules, and
by the feelings that they help to arouse in the heart. In this double
influence the first has a very inferior value, the inner quickening is
what is really important." <span id="fr_79"></span>[†](#fn_79.md)

This is what he would have said at the Czar's Peace Congress:—

"Piyadasi, the friend of the Devas, values alone the harvest of the next
world. For this alone has this inscription been chiselled, that our sons
and our grandsons should make no new conquests. Let them not think that
conquests by the sword merit the name of conquests. Let them see there
ruin, confusion, and violence. True conquests alone are the conquests of
Dharma." <span id="fr_80"></span>[‡](#fn_80.md)

#### OTHER REFORMS.

"Formerly, in the great refectory and temple of King Piyadasi, the
friend of the Devas, many hundred thousand animals were daily sacrificed
for the sake of food meat, . . . but now the joyful chorus resounds
again and again that henceforward not a single animal shall be put to
death." <span id="fr_81"></span>[§](#fn_81.md)

"If a man is subject to slavery and ill-treatment, from this moment he
shall be delivered by the King from this and other captivity. Many men
in this

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

country suffer in captivity, therefore the Stûpa containing the commands
of the King has been a great want." <span id="fr_82"></span>[\*](#fn_82.md)

But King Asoka's Edicts throw a strong light upon one very important
point indeed—the date of the rise of monks in the sense of housed
sedentary idlers. This point I myself have overlooked in my early
examination of these inscriptions.

Asoka's word for the Buddhist monks is Pavajitani. This means houseless
ascetics. The Sanskrit word for a monastery is Sangharâma, the Garden of
the Monks. In point of fact, in the earliest days the monastery was a
forest.

"Everywhere the heaven-beloved Râja Piyadasi's double system of medical
aid is established, both medical aid for men and medical aid for
animals. . . . And wherever there is not such provision, in all such
places it is to be prepared and planted, both root drugs and herbs.
Wheresoever there is not a provision of them, in all such places shall
they be deposited and planted. And in the public highways wells are to
be dug and trees to be planted for the accommodation of men and
animals."

Here is another inscription:—

"Whenever devotees shall abide around (or circumambulate) the holy
fig-tree for the performance of pious acts, the benefit and pleasure of
the country and its inhabitants shall be in making offerings, and
according to their generosity or otherwise they shall enjoy prosperity
or adversity; and they shall give thanks for the coming of the faith.
Whatever villages with their inhabitants may be given or maintained for
the sake of the worship, the devotees shall receive the same, and for
the example of my people they shall exercise solitary austerities. And
likewise whatever blessings they shall pronounce, by these shall my
devotees accumulate for the worship. Furthermore,

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

the people in the night shall attend the great myrobalan-tree and the
holy fig-tree. My people shall accumulate the great myrobalan-tree."

But as regards our present inquiry the King's Rock Edicts are quite
priceless. They enable us to expose one of the most shameless frauds in
all religious history.

About the beginning of the fourth century A.D., there came to Magadha a
young Brahmin who excelled in religious disputation. Near the bo-tree
there was a convent where the youth obtained shelter. And thanks to the
good-natured toleration of the Buddhists, he was allowed day after day
to rehearse his fiery speeches, "clasp his hands," and otherwise get up
his logic and gestures. He attracted the attention of the Mahâthêrô, who
by-and-by converted him.

The eloquence of the new convert soon became more renowned than ever. He
was called "Buddhaghosa," the "Voice of Buddha," because he was as
"eloquent as Buddha himself." These details are from the Mahâwanso, and
so are the significant passages that follow.

One day the head of the Buddhist Church, one Rewato, came to the young
man, and said:—

"In the island of Ceylon is a commentary on the Buddhist holy books. It
is called the Aṭṭhakathâ, and was written in the Cingalese language by
Mahindo, the son of Asoka. Outside Ceylon this commentary does not
exist. Go thither and translate this commentary into Pâli."

Buddhaghosa repaired to Ceylon, to the convent at Anuradhapura, and
commenced his task. A miracle authenticated his qualifications. The
Aṭṭhakathâ in its present form contains more than one life of Buddha,
lives of the six previous Buddhas, and long-winded commentaries on all
the Cingalese Scriptures. These in turn were "recompiled" by the young
convert. The Buddhist Scriptures of

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ceylon, "if
translated into English," says Dr. Rhys Davids, "would be about four
times as long as our Bible." <span id="fr_83"></span>[\*](#fn_83.md) Yet
when this colossal task was completed, the spirits (devas) conjured away
the manuscript, and the painstaking convert went to work a second time.
Again his completed work was spirited away, and again he finished it.
The mischievous spirits then restored the two previous translations, and
to and behold, in the three great compilations, not a "verse," a
"meaning of a word," a "letter," or a transposition differed. By this
miracle Buddhaghosa proved his powers. "Of a truth," said the monks of
Ceylon, "this is the coming Buddha Maitreyo!"

In the long and elaborate article in the "Journal of the Asiatic Society
of Bengal," from which I have been quoting, <span
id="fr_84"></span>[†](#fn_84.md) Turnour makes patent a wholesale
falsification of the ancient Cingalese chronicles by Buddhaghosa.

The main objects of this, in his view, were:—

\(1\) To show that Wijayo, who figures in these chronicles as the first
King of Ceylon, was a disciple of Buddha; that he was sent by Buddha to
Ceylon; that he arrived there at Buddha's death (B.C. 593 in the annals
of Ceylon). As the historical Wijayo, according to Turnour, did not
appear on the page of history until about one hundred years later, the
lives of some of the kings who ruled in Ceylon prior to Asoka have to be
spread out like niggard butter on abundant bread to make up these one
hundred years. One dies over a hundred years of age. Another "commences
a turbulent reign" at ninety. A third seems to have been 147 years of
age. <span id="fr_85"></span>[‡](#fn_85.md) The two dates that can be
checked by Western chronology, the date of Alexander's expedition and
that of Megasthenes to

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> King Chandragupta
at Patna, are both dislodged by these changed dates. Alexander,
according to the Ceylon chronology, must have visited India in the days
of Asoka, and not "during the commotions which preceded the usurpation
of the Indian empire by his grandfather, Sandrocottus." <span
id="fr_86"></span>[\*](#fn_86.md) And the embassy of Megasthenes to Patna
would have to be set down in Asoka's reign likewise.

\(2\) To fill up the same gap, preposterous ages have to be given also
to the monks, who take part in the three convocations that Buddhaghosa
describes.

We must examine more closely these changes of date, but as a preliminary
I must point out that both Rewato, the head of the monastery at Magadha,
and Buddhaghosa were strong partisans of the Mahayana teaching. The
Chinese traveller, Fa Hian, visited this monastery fourteen years before
Buddhaghosa came on the scene and he calls the monastery "the very lofty
and very beautiful Great Vehicle Monastery." <span
id="fr_87"></span>[†](#fn_87.md)

Another point is this, the India Office employed recently the eminent
Chinese scholar, Bunyiu Nanjio, a Japanese, to officially classify the
Buddhist literature from the ancient Chinese lists. He marks down the
Brahmajâla Sûtra, and many other works that are prominent in
Buddhaghosa's Aṭṭhakathâ as Mahayana treatises.

Bearing this in mind one fact certainly emerges. Buddhaghosa had a
strong interest to represent the literature of his day as dating from
the earliest times. He records that a Convocation was held at Rajagriha
by King Ajatasatto, of Magadha, at the date of Buddha's death, namely
B.C. 543.

"At this Convocation," says Mr. Turnour, "the orthodox version of the
Pitakattayan ('Baskets’ of

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Buddhist teaching)
was defined and authenticated with a degree of precision which fixed
even the number of syllables of which it should consist. The
'Commentaries' made or delivered on that occasion acquired the
designation of Aṭṭhakathâ." <span id="fr_88"></span>[\*](#fn_88.md)

But Buddhaghosa plainly attached more significance to another point,
hence his frantic falsification of the date of King Wijayo. He wanted to
show that that monarch was an envoy sent specially by the kingdom of
heaven to fuse together the civil and religious government of Ceylon,
for he announces that Wijayo was sent there as monarch by Buddha
himself, as we have shown. Inferentially the king would thus also be
held to have brought with him the earliest Buddhist teaching.

All this is intelligible, but now come the difficulties. Asoka comes
upon the scene B.C. 260, and converts India. He holds a Convocation, the
Council of Patna, which "reaffirmed" the "Baskets" and Commentaries, a
literature that according to Professor Rhys Davids is in bulk four times
as voluminous as the Christian's Bible. <span
id="fr_89"></span>[†](#fn_89.md)

A son of Asoka, Mahindo, was to have started for Ceylon carrying this
great mass of Buddhist teachings immediately after the Convocation. He
was delayed a year. Then he reached Ceylon in safety, and had the
"Baskets" and Commentary translated into the language of the country,
the Singhalese Prâkrit. It is to this translation that the Mahâthêrô
Rewato alluded when speaking to Buddhaghosa. He talks as if it were only
a Commentary, but the important point was the "Baskets," which he was
about to fill with treatises of Mahayana teaching.

The reader may have observed that I have avoided such words as
"Scriptures," "Literature," "Documents,"

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

in speaking of these baskets. In point of fact Buddhist teaching was
retained exclusively by the memory of the monks and nuns until the date
of King Wittaganini (B.C. 104 to 76).

From this it will be judged that the feat of Mahindo was rather a
noteworthy one. Imagine twenty Oxford Professors getting by heart the
Bible, the Apocrypha, and the Library of Antenicene Fathers, and
proceeding to Ceylon and helping twenty natives of the Island to
translate all this, and become letter perfect with the translation,
without the least aid of any writing or printing. Taking Buddhaghosa's
story as he gives it, is it a plausible one? His main idea escapes. If
he intended to saturate the old scriptures with the strong curry powder
of the Mahâyâna, his adversaries would at once detect the addition, but
he could plead that he was falling back on the real teaching of Mahindo,
which fortunately was still extant, if dormant, in the Cingalese tongue.

But this suggests two awkward questions. Was this Ceylon version an
official Buddhist Scripture, acknowledged by the Buddhists of Ceylon,
and as a corollary by the Buddhists of the Monastery of Magadha, which
was presided over by the Buddhist Pope. If the answer to this be in the
negative there comes up another question, namely—Who took the immense
trouble to get by heart Mahindo's enormous "Baskets" and Commentaries,
and to persuade other Non-Buddhists to learn them up and pass them on
after their death? Certainly for one hundred and fifty years after the
advent of Mahindo, the orthodox Buddhist scriptures in the Pâli language
were passed on *viva voce*. No documents existed until the date of King
Wittaganini (B.C. 146 to 76).

On the other hand, if there was no secret at all about Mahindo's
translation, what was the rationale of

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Buddhaghosa's
astounding feat of penmanship? If the "Baskets" and Commentary were four
times as big as our Bible, his MS. must have been twelve times as big.
And in the presence of the official Pâli version, it would have had no
authority, for the Pâli version claimed to have been ticked off to the
very syllable by the Convocation of Râjagriha, and carefully
"reaffirmed" by the Convocations of Vaisali and Patna. With one sweep of
his chisel Asoka disperses all these air bubbles.

The old history of Ceylon, the Mahâwanso, announces that the King was
puzzled with the question: "Of what religion was Sugato?" which word Mr.
Turnour renders "the Deity of Happy Advent." In consequence he
determined to summon a council of all the monks of Jambudwipa, to be
presided over by Moggaliputra. The Ninth Edict talks of "consultations
upon matters of religion" (Senart's translation). The Third Edict talks
of an Anusam̃yâna (general assembly). The convocation is dated by
scholars, B.C. 244. Certainly the following inscription seems to give us
its results:—

"It is well-known, sirs, to what lengths have gone my respect for and
faith in Buddha, Dharma, Sañgha. All that our Lord Buddha has spoken is
well spoken. Wherefore, sirs, it must indeed be regarded as having
indisputable authority. So the true faith shall last long. Thus, my
lords, I honour with the highest honour those religious works,
Vinayasamaka ('Lessons in Discipline'), Aryavasas ('the Supernatural
Powers of the Aryas’) Anâgatabhayas, ('the Terrors of the Future'),
Munigâtha ('the Metrical Life of Buddha'), Upatisapasina ('the Question
of Upatishya'), Moneyasûta ('the Sûtra on the Inner Life'), and the
Admonition to Râhula concerning falsehood uttered by our Lord Buddha.
These religious works, sir, I would that the Bhikshus and Bhikshunis,
for the

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

advancement of their good name, shall uninterruptedly study and
remember." <span id="fr_90"></span>[\*](#fn_90.md)

This is the inscription, and it is difficult to see how any Orientalist,
or any non-Orientalist, can undervalue its importance. Would Asoka have
had "doubts" and "consultations" as to what Buddha had taught, if a
literature four times as copious as the Christian's Bible was already
received as canonical? And supposing that the canon was fixed before his
time, why should he reject the greater part of it, and only require
about one per cent. of the whole to be learnt and chanted out by his
monks and nuns? The "Question of Upatishya" has come down to us, and
also the "Admonition to Rahûla regarding Falsehood." The two together
would be about as long as the Epistle to Philemon in the Bible, and the
Life of Buddha was also probably very short.

Dr. Oldenburg holds that the seven tractates mentioned on the Second
Bairât Rock are only a portion of the vast literature that Mahinda
carried to Ceylon: but as the memory of the monks was the sole vehicle
by which Buddhist teaching in those days could be handed down, who
committed to memory the remaining literature?—about ninety-nine per
cent. of the whole. Aśoka's monks and nuns were ordered all of them to
learn up and chant the seven Aśoka tractates only.

I have said that we have two of the seven tractates mentioned on the
Second Bairât Rock, the Admonition to Râhula regarding falsehood and the
"Question of Upatishya." I will return to this latter by-and-by.

Munigâtha, a third one, means the metrical life of the Muni (Buddha);
and very ancient metrical scraps, whether genuine or not, are sprinkled
about in the "Lalita Vistara," and in the translation of the Chinese
biography by the Rev. Samuel Beal. From the Chinese

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

records he pronounces that the earliest biography was called "Leaving
the Palace for a Religious Life." Here is a verse where the Prince sees
one of the Four Presaging Tokens, the sick man:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The Prince asked the Coachman and said  
 What man is this enduring such pain?  
 The Coachman replied to the Prince  
 The four elements ill-adjusted—therefore sickness is produced."</span>

</div>

The Sûtra on Vinaya or Discipline, was probably even shorter than the
Metrical life.

The early disciples were Bhikshus, or beggars. Their monasteries were
trees; their temples were forests; their monks’ cowls, tree bark; their
gospel, the human mind.

This comes out in an important set of Buddhist rules—the "Twelve
Observances." The "mob of beggars," as Buddha called his followers, are
expressly forbidden to have any covering over them except a tree. Their
"one seat" is to be mother earth. Their clothes are to be rags from the
dustheap, the dung-heap, the graveyard. The tree that covers the beggar
must be, if possible, in a graveyard. He is to be called Durkhrodpa ("He
who lives in a graveyard").

He is not allowed to sleep twice under the same tree.

Apropos of the early Buddhist ascetic, Dr. Oldenburg cites this from the
Cûla Hatthi padopama sûtta:—

"He dwells in a lonely spot, in a grove, at the foot of a tree, on a
mountain in a cave, in a mountain grotto, in a burial-place in the
wilderness, under an open sky, on a heap of straw." The sculptures of
the early Topes represent marble worshippers crouching before a small
throne or table placed before a marble tree. On the altar are often two
footprints. The recent exhumation of the remains of the Stûpa of Bharhut
(B.C. 250) has placed the

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

meaning of these emblems beyond the region of controversy. Such designs
have been there discovered, and they are furnished with explanations
incised in the Pâli character. One, it is said, is the throne and tree
of Kasyapa, another the throne and tree of Kanaka Muni, and so on
through the list of the Seven Great Buddhas.

Every great Buddha has his tree and his worship. And here I must mention
a curious piece of Chinese puzzle adjustment, which shows how closely
the ritual fits the ancient temple, and the temple the ritual. In Vol.
XVI. of the Asiatic Researches, Professor Wilson gives a ritual from
Nepal, called the Praise of the Seven Buddhas (p. 453) . Each Buddha is
"adored" in a separate paragraph, and it is announced that he found
emancipation under a special tree. Comparing a list of these trees with
that of the Bharhut Stûpa, as given by General Cunningham, <span
id="fr_91"></span>[\*](#fn_91.md) we find that five of the trees exactly
correspond. The sixth, that of Visvabhu, is obliterated. Sakya Muni's
tree in one list is the asvattha, and in the other the pippala—synonyms
for the *Ficus religiosa*. This seems to give great antiquity to the
litany.

I will copy down one or two of these addresses:—

"I adore Jinendra, the consuming fire of sorrow, the treasure of holy
knowledge, whom all revere, who bore the name of Vipasvi, who was born
in the race of mighty monarchs in the city of Bandumati, who was, for
eighty thousand years the preceptor of gods and men; and by whom,
endowed with ten kinds of power, the degree of Jinendra was obtained at
the foot of a patala-tree."

This is the praise of Śâkya Muni:—

"I adore Śâkya Simha the Buddha, the kinsman of the sun, worshipped by
men and gods, who was born at the splendid city Kapilapura, of the
family of the

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

chief of the Śâkya kings, the life of which best friend to all the world
lasted one hundred years.

"Having speedily subdued desire, undoubted wisdom was acquired by him at
the foot of the asvatha tree."

Is it making a great jump to suggest that the little work, the "Praise
of the Seven Buddhas," represents the Aryavasas (the Supernatural powers
of the Aryas) mentioned on the Bairât Rock and that the Vinayasamaka
(Lessons in Discipline) was practically the same as the Twelve
Observances. The discipline of Wanderers not allowed to stay more than a
day in one place, could not have been very elaborate.

An analysis of Buddha's story tells much.

The torso has been hacked about, but it has proved too stout for the
pious Harlequins of the second school of Buddhism. Summed up in a word
its main thesis is man's terror of Death and of its two grim attendants,
Sickness and Old Age. Buddha, like Christ, proposes to find a remedy.
What is that remedy? The Amrita.

Professor Rhys Davids declares that this word does not mean Immortality,
but its reverse. <span id="fr_92"></span>[\*](#fn_92.md) It seems to me
that he might as well say that the French word "immortalité," also
differs completely in meaning from our word "immortality."

"Amrita," "Immortalitas," "Immortalité," "Immortality," are at once four
words and one word—the Sanskrit "Mrita," with a privative, changed in
Italy into "Mors," with a privative. Asoka's Council has given us a
genuine Buddhist parable. Does it teach that annihilation is the supreme
desideratum of humanity? It is very short. I will give it.

#### THE QUESTION OF UPATISITYA.

Upatishya had one supreme fear, the fear of death. One day, in company
with Maudgalyayana (they were

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

both seekers of truth), they witnessed a festival from a hilltop. "See,"
said Upatishya, "in two hundred years all these living beings will be
the prey of death. If there is a principle of destruction, can there not
also be a principle of life?"

This was the "Question of Upatishya," and he propounded it to many
teachers, but none solved it satisfactorily, until he came across
Athadzi, a disciple who expounded to him Buddha's Dharma.

We now come to a-valuable piece of testimony, that of a Greek visiting
India. Seleucus Nicator sent an ambassador, named Megasthenes, to King
Chandragupta (B.C. 302-298). He visited that monarch at his capital,
Palibothra, or Patna. His account of the India of that day is
unfortunately lost; but through Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Arrian, and
Clement of Alexandria, some valuable fragments have come down to us.
Patna, it must be remembered, was in the very heart of the Buddhist Holy
Land. Clement of Alexandria cites a passage from Megasthenes, on Indian
Affairs. On the same page he thus describes the Indian "philosophers":—

"Of these there are two classes, some of them called Sarmanae, and
others Brahmins. And those of the Sarmanae who are called Hylobii
neither inhabit cities nor have roofs over them, but are clothed in the
bark of trees, feed on nuts, and drink water in their hands. Like those
called Encratites in the present day, they know not marriage nor
begetting of children. Some, too, of the Indians obey the precepts of
Buddha, whom, on account of his extraordinary sanctity, they have raised
to divine honours."

The importance of this passage is this, that from Strabo we get the
description given by Megasthenes of the Indian philosophers, and it is
made certain that the earlier part of this passage is from the same
source.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

Strabo describes the Brahmins and the "Germanes," also called, he says,
"Hylobii." He gives the same details as Clement of Alexandria about
their feeding on wild fruits and wearing the bark of trees. He, too,
draws a distinction between the Germanes and the Brahmins on the subject
of continency, the Brahmins being polygamists.

From this it seems certain that Clement of Alexandria was writing the
original work of Megasthenes before him. We may therefore, conclude that
this passage about Buddha, sandwiched as it is between two genuine
citations, was also in Megasthenes. Strabo had handed down to us another
statement of Megasthenes about the Hylobii:—

"By their means the kings serve and worship the Deity."

There can be no doubt that the Sarmanes (Sramanae) and Brahmins of
Megasthenes were the Brahmins and the Buddhists. To the first, according
to Megasthenes, were confided sacrifices and ceremonies, for the dead as
well as for the living. They were a caste apart, and none outside this
caste could perform their duties. The gods would not accept the
sacrifice of such an interloper. Their ideas on life and death were very
similar to those of Plato and the Greeks. The Brahmins ate flesh and had
many wives. Every new year there was a great synod of them.

The theories about early Buddhism held by many moderns—sceptical
philosophers, like Ludwig Büchner as well as the Bishop of Colombo and
the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge—fade completely away in
the presence of these rock chisellings of Asoka. Early Buddhism was
"atheism, pessimism, cosmism," says Büchner. Asoka says "Confess and
believe in God," and he urged that man's supreme duty was to obtain
"union with Sugato." Turnour translates this "the Deity of Happy
Advent." And Buddha certainly

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

sought to relieve the Indian mind of the cruel yoke of the
[Metempsychosis](errata.htm#15.md), an idea which plunged him back a
thousand times into all the sufferings of old age, disease and death.
All who joined his spiritual Sañgha were at once liberated from its
woeful entanglements.

Buddhism when it first emerges in the light is Saint-worship. The seven
great Buddhas, the seven mortal teachers, instead of residing after
death in a Nirvana of Nothingness, were believed still to be interested
in human affairs. His houseless monks (Pavajitani) were certainly not
the monks of the modern Buddhist convents, contemplative monks are not
allowed to speak at all. "The increase of converts is the lustre of
religion," says the king in the Twelfth Edict.

"For a very long time there have been no ministers of religion who,
intermingling among all unbelievers, may overwhelm them with the
inundation of religion, and with the abundance of the sacred doctrines.
Through Kamboja, Gândhâra, Surashtra, and Petenica, and elsewhere,
finding their way unto the uttermost limits of the barbarian countries,
for the benefit and pleasure of all mankind . . . are they appointed.
Intermingling equally among the dreaded and among the respected, both in
Pataliputra and in foreign places, teaching better things shall they
everywhere penetrate." <span id="fr_93"></span>[\*](#fn_93.md) Edict XII.
enjoins that these teachers are to be very gentle and conciliatory with
the "unconverted heretics."

"By such and such conciliatory demeanours shall even the unconverted
heretics be propitiated, and such conduct increaseth the number of
converted heretics."

"Moreover, hear ye the religion of the faithful, and attend thereto,
even such as desire the act, the

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

hope of the beloved of the gods, that all unbelievers may be speedily
purified and brought into contentment speedily." <span
id="fr_94"></span>[\*](#fn_94.md)

The imaginary descriptions of Buddhaghosa have the local colour of his
day; he could not get beyond that. His account of the Convocation at
Buddha's death bristles with splendid monasteries—"eighteen great
viharas filled with rubbish" furbished up for the occasion with
"flowers," "halls," "preaching desks," "ivory fans." He talks of the
"enormous wealth" bestowed by the faithful for religious purposes. And
in the account of the Second Convocation he describes lazy monks, fat
and idle, living in sumptuous monasteries and disputing whether or not
they might have fringes to their couches and drink whey. Professor
Oldenburgh pronounces this Convocation a fictitious one, as it is not
mentioned in the Sanskrit records. Turnour demolishes it by giving an
alleged fact which borders on the farcical. It is said that "eight pious
priests" attended it who had beheld Buddha. As the Convocation was held
exactly one hundred years after Buddha's death, each of these, as Mr.
Turnour shows, must have been at least one hundred and seven years
old. <span id="fr_95"></span>[†](#fn_95.md)

One hundred and fifty years after the alleged Convocation there came a
Greek into the same part of the country, namely Megasthenes. Did he
discover these splendid monasteries with "preaching halls" and "ivory
fans?" <span id="fr_96"></span>[‡](#fn_96.md) On the contrary he describes
certain Wanderers, Sarmanæ, Germanes (the Buddhist Sramanas),
water-drinking Wanderers, sleeping under

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

trees, clad in bark, feeding on wild fruits and vowed to absolute
continence.

We have now to consider what I call the religion of S’iva-Buddhism.
Summed up in a word, it was the intrusion of S’iva as Bhairava into the
early religion, with his "left-handed" Tântrika rites,—sacrifices to
demons as well as to new gods and Buddhas. These could not have taken
place in Asoka's day, because, as he tells us he forbade animal
sacrifice altogether.

Let us begin with the new gods.
