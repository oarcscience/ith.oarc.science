### Notes on "Namu-amida-butsu"

THE ULTIMATE goal of the teaching of the Pure Land is to understand the
meaning of "*Nembutsu*," whereby its followers will be admitted into the
Pure Land. In the *Nembutsu*, contradictions dissolve and are reconciled
in "the steadfastness of faith."

*Nembutsu* literally means "to think of Buddha." *Nen* (*nien* in
Chinese and *smṛiti* in Sanskrit) is "to keep in memory." In Shin
however it is more than a mere remembering of Buddha, it is thinking his
Name, <span id="fr_136"></span>[1](#fn_136.md) holding it in mind. The Name
consists of six characters or syllables: *na-mu-a-mi-da-buts*(*u*) in
Japanese pronunciation and *nan-wu-o-mi-to-fo* in Chinese. In actuality,
the Name contains more than Buddha's name, for *Namu* is added to it.
*Namu* is *namas* (or *namo*) in Sanskrit and means "adoration" or
"salutation." The Name therefore is "Adoration for Amida Buddha," and
this is made to stand for Amida's "Name."

The interpretation the Shin people give to the "Namu-amida-butsu" is
more than literal though not at all mystical or esoteric. It is in fact
philosophical. When Amida is regarded as the object of adoration, he is
separated from the devotee standing

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

all by himself. But when Namu is added to the Name the whole thing
acquires a new meaning because it now symbolizes the unification of
Amida and the devotee, wherein the duality no longer exists. This
however does not indicate that the devotee is lost or absorbed in Amida
so that his individuality is no longer tenable as such. The unity is
there as "Namu" plus "Amidabutsu," but the *Namu* (*ki*) has not
vanished. It is there as if it were not there. This ambivalence is the
mystery of the Nembutsu. In Shin terms it is the oneness of the *ki* and
the *hō*, and the mystery is called the incomprehensibility of
Buddha-wisdom (*Buddhajñā*). The Shin teachings revolve around this axis
of incomprehensibility (*fushigi* in Japanese, *acintya* in Sanskrit).

Now we see that the *Nembutsu*, or the *Myōgō*, or the
"Namu-amida-butsu" is at the center of the Shin faith. When this is
experienced, the devotee has the "steadfastness of faith," even before
he is in actuality ushered into the Pure Land. For the Pure Land is no
more an event after death, it is right in this *sahalokadhātu*, the
world of particulars. According to Saichi, he goes to the Pure Land as
if it were the next-door house and comes back at his pleasure to his
own.

#### 1

I am a happy man, indeed!  
I visit the Pure Land as often as I like:  
I'm there and I'm back,  
I'm there and I'm back,  
I'm there and I'm back,  
"Namu-amida-butsu! Namu-amida-butsu!"

When Saichi is in the Pure Land, "there" stands for this world; and when
he is in this world, "there" is the Pure Land;

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

he is back and forth between here and there. The fact is that he sees no
distinction between the two. Often he goes further than this:

#### 2

How happy I am!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"  
I am the Land of Bliss,  
I am Oya-sama.  
"Namu-amida-butsu! Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 3

Shining in glory is Buddha's Pure Land,  
And this is my Pure Land!  
"Namu-amida-butsu! Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 4

O Saichi, where is your Land of Bliss?  
My Land of Bliss is right here.  
Where is the line of division  
Between this world and the Land of Bliss?  
The eye <span id="fr_137"></span>[2](#fn_137.md) is the line of division.

To Saichi "Oya-sama" or "Oya" not only means Amida himself but
frequently personifies the "Namu-amida-butsu." To him, sometimes, these
three are the same thing: Amida as Oya-sama, the *Myōgō*
("Namu-amida-butsu"), and Saichi.

#### 5

When I worship thee, O Buddha,  
This is a Buddha worshiping another Buddha.  
And it is thou who makest this fact known to me, O Buddha!  
For this favor Saichi is most grateful.

 

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

When we go through these lines endlessly flowing out of Saichi's inner
experiences of the "Namu-amida-butsu" as the symbol of the oneness of
the *ki* and the *hō*, we feel something infinitely alluring in the life
of this simple-minded *geta*-maker in the remote parts of the Far
Eastern country. Eckhart is tremendous, Zen is almost unapproachable,
but Saichi is so homely that one feels like visiting his workshop and
watching those shavings drop off the block of wood.

#### 6

O Saichi, what makes you work?  
I work by the "Namu-amida-butsu."  
"Namu-amida-butsu! Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 7

How grateful I feel!  
Everything I do in this world--  
My daily work for livelihood--  
This is all transferred into building up the Pure Land.

#### 8

I work in this world in company with all Buddhas,  
I work in this world in company with all Bodhisattvas;  
Protected by Oya-sama I am here;  
I know many who have preceded me along this path.  
I am sporting in the midst of the Namu-amida-butsu.  
How happy I am with the favor!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

To see Saichi work in the company of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas who fill
up the whole universe <span id="fr_138"></span>[8](#fn_138.md) must be a
most wonderfully

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

inspiring sight. A scene transferred from the Pure Land! Compared with
this, Eckhart appears to be still harboring something of
this-worldliness. In Saichi all things come out of the mystery of the
"Namu-amida-butsu" in which there is no distinction between "rapturous
moments" and "love for one's neighbors."

There is another aspect in Saichi's life which makes him come close to
that of a Zen-man. For he sometimes rises above the "Namu-amida-butsu,"
above the oneness of the *ki* and *hō*, above the ambivalence of
wretchedness and gratefulness, of misery and joy. He is "indifferent,"
"nonchalant," "detached," or "disinterested" as if he came directly out
of his "is-ness" in all nakedness, in the "*sono-mama*-ness" of things.

#### 9

Perfectly indifferent I am!  
No joy, no gratefulness!  
Yet no grief over the absence of gratefulness.

#### 10

"O Saichi, such as you are,  
Are you grateful to Amida?"  
"No particular feelings I have,  
However much I listen \[to the sermons\];  
And this for no reason."

At all events, Saichi was one of the deepest Shin followers, one who
really experienced the mystery of the oneness of the *ki* and *hō* as
symbolized in the "Namu-amida-butsu." He

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

lived it every moment of his life, beyond all logical absurdities and
semantic impossibilities.

#### 11

O Saichi, <span id="fr_139"></span>[4](#fn_139.md) I am the most fortunate
person!  
I am altogether free from woes of all kind,  
Not at all troubled with anything of the world.  
Nor do I even recite the "Namu-amida-butsu"!  
I'm saved by your mercifulness \[O Amida-san!\]  
How pleased I feel for your favor!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 12

While walking along the mountain path, how I enjoy smoking!  
I sit by the roadside for awhile, I take out the pipe in peace and  
with no trouble beclouding the mind.  
But let us go home now, we have been out long enough, let us go home
now.  
How light my steps are as they move homeway!  
My thoughts are filled with a return trip to Amida's country.  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_136"></span>[161:1](mcb10.htm#fr_136.md) *Myōgō*, *ming-hao*
in Chinese, *nāmadheya* in Sanskrit.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[163:2](mcb10.htm#fr_137.md) This reminds us of
Eckhart.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[164:8](mcb10.htm#fr_138.md) Saichi has this:

What a miracle!  
The "Namu-amida-butsu" fills the whole world! <span id="page_165">p.
165</span>  
And this world is given me by Oya-sama!  
This is my joy!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

<span id="fn_139"></span>[166:4](mcb10.htm#fr_139.md) Saichi often begins
his utterances with the self-addressing "O Saichi" and after a while
forgets the way he started. "You" and "I" thus become confused. Here the
grammatical niceties are disregarded.
