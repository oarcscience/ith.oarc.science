# Preface

This book has no pretension to be a thorough, systematic study of the
subject. It is more or less a collection of studies the author has
written from time to time in the course of his readings, especially of
Meister Eckhart as representative of Christian mysticism. For Eckhart's
thoughts come most closely to those of Zen and Shin. Zen and Shin
superficially differ: one is known as *Jiriki*, the "self-power" school,
while the other is *Tariki*, the "other-power" school. But there is
something common to both, which will be felt by the reader. Eckhart,
Zen, and Shin thus can be grouped together as belonging to the great
school of mysticism. The underlying chain of relationship among the
three may not be always obvious in the following pages. The author's
hope, however, is that they are provocative enough to induce Western
scholars to take up the subject for their study.

The author wishes to acknowledge his debts to the two English
translations of Meister Eckhart, the first by C. de B. Evans and the
second by Raymond B. Blakney, from which he has very liberally quoted.
