### Rennyo's Letters

"THE LETTERS" are those written by Rennyo Shōnin (1415-1499) to his
followers. He was one of the greatest teachers of the Shin school of
Buddhism; in fact it was he who laid the firm foundation for the modern
religious institution known as the Jōdo-Shin Shu, the True Sect of the
Pure Land. His letters numbering about eighty-five are preserved and the
title *Gobunshō* or *Ofumi*, that is, "honorable letters," is given to
them. They are generally read before a sermon and quoted as the most
authoritative source-documents on the teaching of the Shin school.
Saichi states here that when his mind is illumined by these epistles he
realizes what a miserable creature he is; but when he sees the
Buddha-mind as revealed through these illuminating documents of the
great teacher, he is assured of the overwhelming immensity of Oya-sama's
love for him and feels grateful for it without measure. Rennyo's letters
serve to bring out both aspects of our religious consciousness: (1) the
sense of wickedness and depravity and (2) the feeling of gratitude for
being saved from an utterly helpless situation. Here is one of Rennyo's
letters:

To be established in \[Shin\] faith means to understand the

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Eighteenth Vow. <span
id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_140.md) To understand the Eighteenth Vow means
to understand the frame of mind <span id="fr_141"></span>[2](#fn_142.md)
the "Namu-amida-butsu" sets up in you. <span
id="fr_142"></span>[1a](#fn_141.md)

Therefore, when you attain a state of single-mindedness as you utter the
"*Namu*" <span id="fr_143"></span>[2](#fn_142.md) with absolute trust \[in
Amida\] you perceive the significance of Amida's Vow which is directed
towards awakening a faith-frame in you. For herein we realize what is
meant by Amida Nyorai's "turning towards" <span
id="fr_144"></span>[3](#fn_143.md) us ignorant beings. This is pointed out
in the *Larger Sūtra of Eternal Life* <span
id="fr_145"></span>[4](#fn_144.md) where we read: "Amida provides all
beings with all the merits." <span id="fr_146"></span>[5](#fn_145.md)

Thus it follows that with all the evil deeds, with all the evil passions
we have been cherishing in our former lives ever since the beginningless
past, we are, owing to Amida's Vow which is beyond comprehension,
thoroughly cleansed of them with no residue whatever left; and in
consequence of it, we are made to abide with no fear of regression in
"the order of steadfastness." <span id="fr_147"></span>[6](#fn_146.md)

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

This is what is meant by the statement that Nirvana is attainable
without destroying the evil passions (*kleśa*). <span
id="fr_148"></span>[7](#fn_147.md)

This is the teaching exclusively taken up by our school but you are
warned not to talk this way to people of other schools. Let me remind
you of this.

With reverence . . .

The translation of such documents as Rennyo's letters is full of
difficulties as they are so laden with technical terms which defy in
many cases replacement by any other languages. The terms require lengthy
explanations, which I have to omit. But a word about the
"Namu-amida-butsu."

"Namu-amida-butsu" is the Japanese reading of the original Sanskrit
phrase "namo amitābhabuddhāya," meaning "Adoration of the Buddha of
Infinite Light." But with followers of the Pure Land teaching, the
phrase is far more than mere adoration for Amitābhabuddha, or Amida, for
by this they express their absolute faith in Amida as one who makes it
possible for them to be born in his Land of Purity and Bliss.

With popular minds "Namu-amida-butsu" is rather a confused notion, for
as in the case of Saichi the phrase frequently represents Reality itself
impersonated as Amida or Oya-sama, and at the same time it is a form of
adoration as well as the expression of absolute dependence. This is not,
however, all of "Namu-amida-butsu," for the phrase often serves as a
metaphysical formula symbolizing the identity of subject and object, of
the devotee and Amida, of the "sin-laden" individual

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

and the all-saving and all-merciful Oya-sama, of all beings
(*sarvasattva*) and Buddha, of *ki* and *hō*, of human yearnings and the
supreme enlightenment. In this sense, the phrase, "Namu-amida-butsu,"
stands for a state of consciousness in which Saichi finds it sometimes
difficult to distinguish himself from Amida.

#### 13

The Oya-sama who never fails me  
Has now become myself,  
Making me hear his Name--  
The "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 14

I am a fortunate one:  
Oya-sama is given me,  
The Oya who turns me into a Buddha--  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

When the phrase is used as a philosophical symbol, it is usually divided
first into two parts: "Namu" (*ki*) and "Amida-butsu" (*hō*). "Namu"
then stands for the devotee filled with all possible sinfulness while
"Amida-butsu" is the Buddha of infinite light and eternal life. When the
devotee pronounces the phrase, "Namu-amida-butsu," he is the
"Namu-amida-butsu" itself. When Saichi repeats "Namu-amida-butsu,"
"Namu-amida-butsu," the phrase is to be understood in this sense, and no
idea of supplication or mere adoration is implied here. Saichi in this
case may be said to be like Tennyson calling himself "Alfred," "Alfred"
as he tells us in his "Ancient Sage." Saichi here is completely drunk
with the identification, completely absorbed in the mystery, through
which the miserable Saichi carrying all his human passions

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

and cravings finds himself transformed into a Buddha and in the presence
of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and other holy souls. In a state of
ecstasy or intoxication, Saichi does not know where to stop when he jots
down in his schoolboy's notebook all that goes through his mind while
busying himself with making the footgear. Saichi's repetition of
"Namu-amida-butsu" is to be interpreted in this way.

Saichi often addresses himself, asking such questions as: "What are you
doing now, O Saichi?" "How are you faring, O Saichi?" "Say, Saichi,
where are you?" "Why don't you stop writing?" and so on. These questions
evidently show that his was a dual personality: the "miserable,
despicable, woebegone" Saichi was living together with Amida or Oya-sama
when Amida was felt to be near. Sometimes Saichi felt that it was not he
who addressed Amida or himself but Amida addressing Amida. Amida's
presence in Saichi was not a visionary experience. Amida really directed
Saichi's movements while this by no means prevented Saichi from being
himself, from being a miserable existence incalculably separated from
Amida. But Saichi felt at the same moment that without this miserable
existence of his he could not experience all the joy that came from
unity. <span id="fr_149"></span>[8](#fn_148.md)

The psychologists may declare Saichi to be a very good example

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

of schizophrenia. But they forget that Saichi is not a sick person, not
a case of psychosis, tormented by the split. He is a perfectly healthy
personality, he has never lost the sense of the oneness of his being. In
fact his sense of being is so deep and yet so definite that he is living
a more real and meaningful life than most of us do. It is we and not he
who live in a psychological duality with all its disturbing
consequences.

Eckhart once gave a sermon on "the just lives in eternity" in which he
says:

The just lives in God and God in him, for God is born in the just and
the just in God: at every virtue of the just God is born and is
rejoiced, and not only every virtue but every action of the just wrought
out of the virtue of the just and in justice; thereat God is glad aye,
thrilled with joy, there is nothing in his ground that does not dance
for joy. To unenlightened (*grob*) people this is matter for belief but
the illumined know. <span id="fr_150"></span>[9](#fn_149.md)

It is illuminating to hear Eckhart say that "to the coarse-minded
(*grob*) people this is matter for belief but the enlightened know
(*wissen*)." "The coarse-minded" means those who cannot go beyond the
senses and the intellect, for they do not know anything that takes place
in the realm of *prajñā*-intuition. The Oya-sama whose all-embracing and
all-comprehending love makes Saichi hear his Name, "Namu-amida-butsu,"
first becomes Saichi himself. This means that the Oya-sama
individualizes himself as a Saichi in the same way as Eckhart would have
God "be born in the just and the just in God" and then hears his own
Name pronounced by his individualized human Saichi. Amida is now
transformed

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

into the "Namu-amida-butsu" in the being of Saichi and Saichi in turn
becomes Amida by hearing Amida's Name, "Namu-amida-butsu" as pronounced
by Saichi himself. In this unity it is difficult to distinguish who is
Amida and who is Saichi. When the one is mentioned the other inevitably
comes along. Amida's Pure Land cannot now be anything else but Saichi's
*sahaloka*--this *shaba* world of particular existences.

#### 15

Oya is in the Pure Land,  
I am in this world,  
And Oya has given me,  
To become one with me:  
The "Namu-amida-butsu"!

#### 16

Let me go to the Pure Land,  
Which is like visiting my neighbors  
This world is the Pure Land.  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 17

You are not saying the *Nembutsu*,  
It is the *Nembutsu* that makes you say it,  
And you are taken to the Pure Land.  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_140"></span>[168:1](mcb11.htm#fr_140.md) "If upon my obtaining
[Buddhahood](errata.htm#2.md), all beings in the ten quarters should not
desire in sincerity and trustfulness to be in my country, and if they
should not be born there by only thinking of me, say, up to ten times .
. . may I not attain the Highest Enlightenment."

<span id="fn_141"></span>[168:1a](mcb11.htm#fr_142.md) Transcriber's note:
from "understand" to "sets" was somehow inserted into the footnotes on
this page above footnote 2. This fragment makes a lot more sense when
inserted between "means to" and "up in you" in this sentence, so I have
placed it there.--JBH.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[168:2](mcb11.htm#fr_143.md) As was explained, the
*Nembutsu* which consists of the six syllables,
*Na-mu-a-mi-da-buts*(*u*), is a miraculous formula. When this is
pronounced in sincerity of heart and in absolute faith in Amida, it
produces a certain state of consciousness which is termed here "frame of
mind" or "faith-frame." When it is attained, the devotee is said to have
joined "the group of steadfastness" with no fear of retrogression. The
faith thus awakened assures one of birth in the Pure Land.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[168:3](mcb11.htm#fr_144.md) The miracle of Shin
faith is that when the ordinary-minded people are confirmed in their
faith all their sins and evil passions are transferred to Amida, and it
is then he and not the actual sinners that would bear all the dire
karma-consequences. More than that, all the merits Amida has accumulated
during his infinite lives of self-training are given freely to the
devotee. This is technically known as the doctrine of transference
(*pariṇāmanā*).

<span id="fn_144"></span>[168:4](mcb11.htm#fr_145.md) This is the principal
*Mahāyāna Sūtra* on which Shin teachings are based. But the Shin text is
Sanghavarman's Chinese translation executed in 252 A.D., when he came to
China from Central Asia.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[168:5](mcb11.htm#fr_146.md) This "transference of
merit" has a deep metaphysical significance in the history of Buddhist
thought in India and China.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[168:6](mcb11.htm#fr_147.md) The "order of
steadfastness" is a stage where Shin devotees become <span
id="page_169">p. 169</span> absolutely sure of their rebirth in the Pure
Land, that is to say, when they see as Saichi does all the doors removed
which keep this world in separation from the Pure Land.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[169:7](mcb11.htm#fr_148.md) *Nirvāna* is *kleśa*
(*bonnō*) and *kleśa* is *Nirvāna*--this is one of the great Mahāyāna
teachings. When however its import is not properly comprehended, it
lends itself to all kinds of dangerous misinterpretation for which
mysticism is usually blamed. Eckhart for this reason was censored as a
heretic.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[171:8](mcb11.htm#fr_149.md) Meister Eckhart, as
quoted by Paul Tillich in his paper on "The Types of Philosophy of
Religion," says: "There is between God and the soul neither strangeness
nor remoteness, therefore the soul is not only equal with God but it
is-the same that He is." To Saichi, Amida is both remote and near,
perhaps to him Amida is near because of his remoteness, he is remote
because of his nearness. To use Saichi's own words: "Saichi feels
miserable because he is full of evil cravings, but it is just because of
his misery that he is made to [appreciate](errata.htm#3.md) the
loving-kindness of Amida who is no other than his Oya-sama and that the
joy and the feeling of gratitude following the appreciation know no
bounds, even going beyond the limits of the whole universe."
