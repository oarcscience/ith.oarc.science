### From Saichi's Journals

THE FOLLOWING are translations in English of some of Saichi's
utterances. As I have said before, there are several thousands of such
items in his journals, and there is no doubt that they are good material
for students of religious experiences. My attempt here is, however poor
the translations, to afford the reader a glimpse into Saichi's inner
life. Unless one has a thorough mastery of both languages, Japanese and
English, it is impossible to convey to the English reader the deep
underlying feelings characterizing Saichi as one of the most
conspicuously *myōkōnin* type of Shin followers.

The following selections, numbering 148, are grouped under nine
headings. The classification is not at all scientific, since it is often
very difficult to classify certain expressions under a certain definite
group because they include various ideas interrelated to one another.
The nine are as follows:

1\. Nyorai and Saichi  
2. Oya-sama  
3. The Nembutsu  
4. The *Ki* and the *Hō*  
5. The Pure Land, This World and Hell  
6. The Free Gift  
7. The Heart-searchings  
8. Poverty  
9. The Inner Life

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

### 1. NYORAI <span id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_150) AND SAICHI <span id="fr_152"></span>[2](#fn_151)

#### 1

I exchange work with Amida:  
I worship him who in turn deigns to worship me--  
This is the way I exchange work with him. <span
id="fr_153"></span>[3](#fn_152)

#### 2

"O Saichi, who is Nyorai-san?"  
"He is no other than myself."  
"Who is the founder \[of the Shin teaching\]?"  
"He is no other than myself."  
"What is the canonical text?"  
"It is no other than myself."  
The ordinary man's heart has no fixed root,  
Yet this rootless one takes delight in the *Hō* \[i.e., *Dharma*\];  
This is because he is given Oya's heart--  
The heart of "Namu-amida-butsu."

 

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

#### 3

I am lying,  
Amida deigns to worship Saichi,  
I too in turn worship Amida  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 4

The adorable form of Nyorai  
Is indeed this wretched self's form  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu! <span
id="fr_154"></span>[4](#fn_153)

#### 5

Buddha is worshiped by \[another\] Buddha:  
The Namu is worshiped by Amida,  
Amida is worshiped by the Namu:  
This is the meaning of *kimyo* <span id="fr_155"></span>[5](#fn_154)  
As expressed in the "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 6

Amida calling on Amida  
This voice  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 7

Saichi exchanges work with Amida:  
When he worships Amida, <span id="page_177">p. 177</span>  
Amida in turn deigns to worship him \[Saichi\]--  
This is the way we exchange our work.  
How happy I am with the favor!  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 8

When I worship thee, O Buddha,  
This is Buddha worshiping \[another\] Buddha,  
And it is thou who makest this fact known to me, O Buddha:  
For this favor Saichi is most grateful.

#### 9

What all the Buddhas of the *Hokkai* <span
id="fr_156"></span>[6](#fn_155) declare  
Is to make this Saichi turn into a Buddha--  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 10

My joy!  
How beyond thought!  
Self and Amida and the "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 11

How fine!  
The whole world and vastness of space is Buddha!  
And I am in it--"Namu-amida-butsu!"

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

### 2. OYA-SAMA <span id="fr_157"></span>[7](#fn_156)

#### 12

Oya-sama is Buddha  
Who transforms Saichi into a Buddha--  
How happy with the favor!  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 13

My heart and Oya-sama--  
We have just one heart  
Of "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 14

I am a happy man,  
A glad heart is given me;  
Amida's gladness is my gladness--  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 15

The heart that thinks \[of Buddha\]  
Is Buddha's heart,  
A Buddha given by Buddha--  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 16

How grateful I am!  
Into my heart has Oya-sama entered and fully occupies it.  
The cloud of doubt all dispersed, <span id="page_179">p. 179</span>  
I am now made to turn westward.  
How fortunate I am!  
Saying "Namu-amida-butsu" I return west.

#### 17

Are devils <span id="fr_158"></span>[8](#fn_157) come?  
Are serpents come?  
I know not.  
I live my life embraced in the arms of Oya-sama,  
I am fed with the milk of "Namu-amida-butsu,"  
Looking at Oya-sama's face.  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 18

When he is known as Oya,  
Worship him as such:  
Oya and I are one--  
The oneness of *ki* and *hō*  
In the "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 19

Amida is my Oya-sama,  
I am child of Amida;  
Let me rejoice in Oya-sama, in "Namu-amida-butsu."  
The "Namu-amida-butsu" belongs to child as well as to Oya-sama:  
By this is known the mutual relationship \[between Thee and me\].

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

#### 20

My heart and thy heart--  
The oneness of hearts--  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 21

How lucky I am!  
Oya is given me!  
Oya who turns me into a Buddha is  
The "Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 22

The *Hokkai* is my Oya--  
Being my Oya--  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 23

Oya and child--  
Between them not a shadow of doubt: <span
id="fr_159"></span>[9](#fn_158)  
This is my joy!

#### 24

The *Namu* and Amida,  
Oya and child,  
They quarrel: the *Namu* on one side and *Amida* on the other side.  
Repentance and joyfulness--  
How intimate!

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

#### 25

What is Saichi's understanding of the "Namu-amida-butsu"?  
Yes, I am an adopted child of "Namu-amida-butsu."  
How do you understand a life of gratitude?  
As to being grateful, sometimes I remember it, sometimes I do not.  
Really, a wretched man I am!

#### 26

Namu-san <span id="fr_160"></span>[10](#fn_159) and Amida-san are
talking:  
This is the "Namu-amida-butsu" of Oya and son.

#### 27

Namu-san and Amida-san--both are Amida:  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"  
This happiness is my happiness.

#### 28

"Namu-amida-butsu!"--how grateful I am!  
"Namu-amida-butsu" is the oneness of the worldly and the highest
truth.  
'Namu-amida-butsu!"--how happy I am for the favor!  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"  
Wherefrom is "Namu-amida-butsu"?  
It is the mercy issuing from Oya's bosom;  
How happy I am with the favor, "Namu-amida-butsu!"  
"Wherefor is Saichi bound?"  
'Saichi will go to the Land of Bliss."  
"With whom?"  
"With Oya-sama I go--how happy I am!"  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

### 3. THE NEMBUTSU <span id="fr_161"></span>[11](#fn_160)

#### 29

"O Saichi, do, you recite the *Nembutsu* only when you think of it?  
What do you do when you do not think of it?"  
"Yes, \[well,\] when I do not think of it, there is  
The 'Namu-amida-butsu' \[just the same\]--  
The oneness of *ki* and *hō*;  
Even my thinking of \[the *Nembutsu*\] rises out of it.  
How thankful I am for the favor!"  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 30

Hōnen Shōnin \[is said to have recited the *Nembutsu*\] sixty thousand
times \[a day\];  
With Saichi it is only now and then.  
Sixty-thousand-times and now-and-then--  
They are one thing.  
How grateful I am for the favor!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 31

"O Nyorai-san, do you take me--this wretched one such as I am?  
Surely because of the presence of such wretched ones as you,  
Oya-sama's mercy is needed--<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>  
The Name is just meant for you, O Saichi,  
And it is yours."  
"That is so, I am really grateful,  
I am grateful for the favor--  
Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 32

All the miraculous merits accumulated by Amida  
Throughout his disciplinary life of innumerable eons  
Are filling up this body called Saichi.  
Merits are no other than the six syllables "*Na-mu-a-mi-da-buts*(*u*)."

#### 33

The "Namu-amida-butsu" is inexhaustible,  
However much one recites it, it is inexhaustible;  
Saichi's heart is inexhaustible;  
Oya's heart is inexhaustible.  
Oya's heart and Saichi's heart,  
*Ki* and *hō*, are of one body which is the "Namu-amida-butsu."  
However much this is recited, it is inexhaustible.

#### 34

To Saichi such as he is, something wonderful has happened--  
That heart of his has turned into Buddhahood!  
What an extraordinary event this!  
What things beyond imagination are in store within the  
"Namu-amida-butsu"!

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

#### 35

The "Namu-amida-butsu"  
Is like the sun-god,  
Is like the world,  
Is like the great earth,  
Is like the ocean!  
Whatever Saichi's heart may be,  
He is enveloped in the emptiness of space,  
And the emptiness of space is enveloped in "Namu-amida-butsu"!  
O my friends, be pleased to hear the "Namu-amida-butsu"--  
"Namu-amida-butsu" that will free you from *Jigoku* \[hell\].

#### 36

The *Nembutsu* is like vastness of space,  
The vastness of space is illumined by Oya-sama's *Nembutsu*.  
My heart is illumined by Oya-sama.  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 37

For what reason it is I do not know,  
But the fact is the "Namu-amida-butsu" has come upon me.

#### 38

How wretched! What shall I do?  
\[But\] wretchedness is the "Namu-amida-butsu"--  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

#### 39

There is nothing in the *Hokkai*;  
Only one there is,  
Which is the "Namu-amida-butsu"  
And this is Saichi's property.

#### 40

The "Namu-amida-butsu" is transformed and I am it,  
And it delights in me,  
And I am delighted in it.

#### 41

How wretched!  
And how joyous!  
They are one  
\[In\] the "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 42

The *Nembutsu* of repentance over my wretchedness,  
The *Nembutsu* of joy--  
The "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 43

I may be in possession of 84,000 evil passions,  
And Amida too is 84,000--  
This is the meaning of oneness of "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 44

The *Namu* is myself,  
Amida is the *Namu*;  
And both *Namu* and Amida are the "Namu-amida-butsu."

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

#### 45

I, bound for death,  
Am now made into the immortal "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 46

Life's ending means not-dying;  
Not-dying is life's ending;  
Life's ending is to become "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 47

Death has been snatched away from me,  
And in its place the "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 48

Saichi's heart destined for death when his end comes,  
Is now made an immortal heart,  
Is made into the "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 49

To die--nothing is better than death;  
One feels so relieved!  
Nothing exceeds this feeling of relief.  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

### 4. THE KI AND THE HŌ <span id="fr_162"></span>[12](#fn_161)

#### 50

"O Saichi, let me have what your understanding is."  
"Yes, yes, I will:  
How miserable, how miserable!  
Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"  
"Is that all, O Saichi?  
It will never do."  
"Yes, yes, it will do, it will do.  
According to Saichi's understanding,  
*Ki* and *hō* are one:  
The 'Namu-amida-butsu' is no other than he himself.  
This is indeed Saichi's understanding:  
He has flowers in both hands,  
Taken away in one way and given as gift in another way."

#### 51

How happy I am for this favor! "Namu-amida-butsu!"  
Now I know where to deposit all my amassed delusions:  
It is where the *ki* and the *hō* are one--  
The "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 52

Such a Buddha! he is really a good Buddha!  
He follows me wherever I go,  
He takes hold of my heart.  
The saving voice of the six syllables <span id="page_188">p.
188</span>  
Is heard as the oneness of the *ki* and the *hō*--  
As the "Namu-amida-butsu."  
I have altogether no words for this;  
How sweet the mercy!

#### 53

No clinging to anything (*kata-giru ja nai*)  
No clinging to the *ki*,  
No clinging to the *hō*--  
This is in accord with the Law (*okite ni kanō*).  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

This on the part of the *ki*,  
This on the part of the *hō*.  
How grateful I am!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 54

How wretched!  
What is it that makes up my heart?  
It is no other than my own filled with infinitude of guilt,  
Into which the two syllables *na-mu* have come,  
And by these syllables infinitude of guilt is borne,  
It is Amida who bears infinitude of guilt.  
The oneness of the *ki* and the *hō*  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 55

Saichi's Nyorai-san,  
Where is he?  
Saichi's Nyorai-san is no other than the oneness of the *ki* and the
*hō*  
How grateful I am! "Namu-amida-butsu!"  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

#### 56

O Saichi, if you wish to see Buddha,  
Look within your own heart where the *ki* and the *hō* are one  
As the "Namu-amida-butsu"--  
This is Saichi's Oya-sama.  
How happy with the favor!  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 57

If the *Namu* is myself, Amida is myself too:  
This is the "Namu-amida-butsu" of six syllables. <span
id="fr_163"></span>[13](#fn_162)

#### 58

The *Namu* is worshiped by Amida,  
And Amida is worshiped by the *Namu*--  
This is the "Namu-amida-butsu" of six syllables.

#### 59

This Saichi is thine,  
Thou art mine--  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 60

As to Saichi's own Nyorai-san,  
Where is he?  
Yes, Saichi's Nyorai-san is the oneness of the *ki* and the *hō*.  
How grateful I am I  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

#### 61

"O Saichi, what are you saying to Oya-sama?"  
"I am saying, 'Amida-bu, Amida-bu'."  
"What is Oya-sama saying?"  
"He is saying, 'O *Namu*, O *Namu*'."  
Thus Thou to me, and I to Thee:  
This is the oneness of the *ki* and the *hō*.  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 62

"O Saichi, how do you see 'thee'?"  
"To see 'thee' \[take\] Amida's mirror,  
Therein revealed are both *ki* and *hō*.  
Beyond that--repentance and joy.  
How wonderful, how wonderful!  
Grateful indeed I am! Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 63

How wretched!--  
This comes out spontaneously.  
How grateful for Buddha's favor!--  
This too spontaneously.  
The *ki* and the *hō*, both are Oya's working.

#### 64

All comes out in perfection.  
How grateful for the favor!  
And I take no part in it.  
How grateful for the favor!  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

### 5. THE PURE LAND, THIS WORLD AND HELL <span id="fr_164"></span>[14](#fn_163)

#### 65

"O Saichi, what is your pleasure?"  
"My pleasure is this world of delusion;  
Because it turns into the seed of delight in the *Dharma* (*hō*)."  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 66

This world (*sahaloka*) and the Pure Land--they are one;  
Worlds as numberless as atoms, too, are mine.  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 67

The path to be born into the Land of Bliss  
From this world, there is no other, after all,  
Than this world itself.  
This world is Namu-amida-butsu  
just as much as the Land of Bliss is.  
How grateful, how grateful I am!  
This Saichi's eye <span id="fr_165"></span>[15](#fn_164) is the boundary
line  
\[Between this world and the Land of Bliss\].  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

#### 68

Where are you sleeping, O Saichi?  
I am sleeping in this world's Pure Land;  
When awakened I go to Amida's Pure Land.

#### 69

This is *shaba* (Sanskrit: *sahaloka*),  
And my heart is born of *Jigoku* (Sanskrit: *naraka*).

#### 70

"O Saichi, when you die, who will be your companion to the Land of
Bliss?"  
"As to me, Emma-san will be my companion."  
"O Saichi, you tell us such tales again.  
Who has ever gone to the Land of Bliss with Emma-san as companion?  
O Saichi, you'd better not tell us such nonsense any more."  
"In spite of your remark, I say you are mistaken;  
Have you not read this in the 'Songs'?  
'Emma, Great Lord of Justice, respects us; together with lords of the
five paths, he stands as guardian day and night.'  
You too should rejoice in the company of Emma-sama--  
Here is Namu-amida-butsu.  
This world, how enjoyable with Emma-sama!  
This Saichi too is guarded by Emma-sama,  
This Saichi and Emma-sama both are one Namu-amida-butsu:  
This is my joy!"  
"O Saichi, from whom did you get such a joyous note?"  
"Yes, I talked with Emma-sama himself who granted this to me--<span
id="page_193">p. 193</span>  
\[He says\] 'You are welcome indeed.'  
How joyful! how joyful!  
Namu-amida-butsu! Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 71

I'm fortunate indeed!  
Not dead I go,  
just as I live,  
I go to the Pure Land!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 72

Led by "Namu-amida-butsu,"  
While living in this world,  
I go to "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 73

I'm fortunate indeed!  
Not dead I go,  
just as I live,  
I go to the Pure Land!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 74

I am poor and immensely happy at that;  
Amida's Pure Land I enjoy while here--  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

#### 75

If the *shaba* world is different from the Pure Land,  
I should never have heard the *Dharma*:  
Myself and this *shaba* world and the Pure Land and Amida--  
All is one "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 76

This *shaba* world too is yours,  
Where Saichi's rebirth is confirmed--  
This is your waiting teahouse.

#### 77

This *shaba* turned into the Pure Land,  
And myself changing!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 78

My joy is that while in this world of *shaba*  
I have been given the Pure Land--  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 79

My birthplace? I am born of *Jigoku* (hell);  
I am a nobody's dog  
Carrying the tail between the legs;  
I pass this world of woes,  
Saying "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 80

How happy I am! "Namu-amida-butsu!"  
I am the Land of Bliss;  
I am Oya-sama.  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

#### 81

Shining in glory is Amida's Pure Land,  
And this is my Pure Land--  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 82

Heard so much of the Happy Land,  
But after all it is not so much \[as I expected\];  
It is good that it is not, indeed,  
How at home do I feel with it!  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 83

The Land of Bliss is mine,  
Just take "Namu-amida-butsu" as you hear it!

#### 84

How grateful!  
While others die,  
I do not die:  
Not dying, I go  
To Amida's Pure Land.

#### 85

Has Saichi ever seen the Land of Bliss?  
No, Saichi has never seen it before.  
That is good--  
The first visit this.

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

#### 86

How grateful I am!  
I live without knowing anything--  
Is this living in a natural Pure Land?

#### 87

How grateful I am!  
Into my heart has Oya-sama entered!  
The cloud of doubt is all dispersed,  
I am now given to turn westward.  
How fortunate I am!  
Saying "Namu-amida-butsu," I turn west.

#### 88

Buddha-wisdom is beyond human thought,  
It makes me go to the Pure Land.  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 89

How dreadful!  
This world known as *shaba*  
Is where we endlessly commit all kinds of karma.  
How thankful!  
All this is turned into \[the work of\] the Pure Land,  
Unintermittently!

#### 90

The most wonderful thing is  
That Buddha's invisible heart of compassion is visible  
While I'm right here; <span id="page_197">p. 197</span>  
That the Pure Land, millions of millions of worlds away,  
is visible  
While I'm right here--  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 91

I am not to go to *Jigoku* (hell),  
*Jigoku* is right here,  
We are living right in *Jigoku*,  
*Jigoku* is no other place than this.

#### 92

The *Hokkai* is never filled  
However much we may talk of it  
Which is the Land of Bliss.  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 93

The *Hokkai* is Saichi's own country--  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 94

There is a man going back to Amida's Pure Land--  
The *Namu* is carried by Amida.  
The Pure Land where he returns  
Is the "Namu-amida-butsu."

The being reborn means this present moment;  
By means of the "Namu-amida-butsu" this is attained;  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

### 6. THE FREE GIFT <span id="fr_166"></span>[16](#fn_165)

#### 96

Let this world go as it does,  
Ignorance-debts, all paid up by Nyorai-san--  
How happy, how happy I am!

#### 97

Whatever we might say, it is all from thy side,  
Yes, it is all from thee.  
How thankful I am indeed, how happy I am indeed!  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 98

The "Namu-amida-butsu" is as great as the world itself;  
All the air is the "Namu-amida-butsu";  
My heart is also a big heart,  
My *tsumi* is filling the world.  
However bad Saichi may be, he cannot defeat you, \[O Buddha\];  
My *tsumi* is dragged along by you,  
And it is now taken up \[by you\] to the Pure Land  
This favor of yours, this favor of yours!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

#### 99

The treasure of the six syllables was given me by Oya-sama:  
However much one spends of it, it is never exhausted.  
The treasure grows all the more as it is used;  
It is the most wondrous treasure,  
And I am the recipient of the good thing.  
How happy I am with the favor! "Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 100

"O Saichi, you say 'I am given, I am given'  
And what is it that is given you?"  
"Yes, yes, I am given, I am given the Name of Amida!  
And this for nothing I  
Saichi is thereby set at ease.  
To be set at ease means that the *ki* is altogether possessed \[by
Oya-sama\].  
It is indeed Oya-sama who has taken full possession of me,  
And this Oya-sama of mine is the 'Namu-amida-butsu.'

#### 101

Saichi has his heart revealed by Amida's mirror,  
How happy for the favor! "Namu-amida-butsu!"  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 102

What a miracle! The "Namu-amida-butsu" fills up the whole world,  
And this world is given to me by Oya-sama.  
This is my happiness, "Namu-amida-butsu!"

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

#### 103

O Nyorai-san,  
You have given up yourself to me,  
And my heart has been made captive by you--  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 104

How miserable!  
Saichi's heart, how miserable!  
All kinds of delusion thickly arise all at once!  
A hateful fire mixed with evils is burning,  
The waves mixed with evils are rising,  
How miserable! A fire mixed with follies is burning.

This heretic, how miserable!  
Cannot you call a halt?

Saichi's heart, worrying,  
A heart in utter confusion,  
Saichi's heart rising as high as the sky!

Here comes the wise man giving the warning:  
"O Saichi, listen, now is the time!"

How grateful!  
"Now that Amida's 'Original Vow' is established as the
'Namu-amida-butsu,'  
You have no more to worry about yourself,  
Listen, listen!  
When you hear 'Namu-amida-butsu,'  
You have your rebirth in the Pure Land.  
The 'Namu-amida-butsu' is yours." <span id="page_201">p. 201</span>  
How happy I am for this favor! "Namu-amida-butsu!"  
Now I know where to deposit all my amassed delusions:  
It is where the *ki* and *hō* are one--  
The "Namu-amida-butsu."

With this heart \[thus identified\],  
All over the worlds as many as atoms,  
I roam playing in company with all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Eating the "Namu-amida-butsu," this heart passes its time  
In happy company with the "Namu-amida-butsu."

How happy with this favor!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 105

O you, my friends, looking at your hearts filled with wretchedness,  
Be not led to doubt Amida's mercy,  
Though there is indeed this possibility.  
But this is the greatest mistake you are apt to commit.  
An utter wretchedness we all guilty beings experience  
Does surely turn into a priceless treasure  
This you will realize when karma ripens;  
For the "Namu-amida-butsu" truly achieves wonders.

That the "Namu-amida-butsu" truly achieves wonders is this:  
The oceans, mountains, eatables, waters, wood used for our
house-building, and all other things handled by us guilty beings: <span
id="page_202">p. 202</span>  
They are one and all transformations of the "Namu-amida-butsu."  
O my friends, be pleased to take note of this truth,  
For this is all due to Oya-sama's mercy.  
How grateful I feel for all this!

"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 106

How grateful!  
When I think of it, all is by his \[Amida's\] grace.  
O Saichi, what do you mean by it?  
Ah, yes, his grace is real fact.  
This Saichi was made by his grace;  
The dress I wear was made by his grace;  
The food I eat was made by his grace;  
The footgear I put on was made by his grace;  
Every other thing we have in this world was all made by his grace,  
Including the bowl and the chopsticks;  
Even this workshop where I work was made by his grace:  
There is really nothing that is not the "Namu-amida-butsu."  
How happy I am for all this!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 107

By your favor I am turned into a Buddha;  
Infinitely great is this favor of yours  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

#### 108

"Saichi's illness, is it cured by swallowing the 'Namu-amida-butsu'?"  
"O, no!"  
"If so, how is it cured?"  
"Yes, Saichi's illness is cured when it is swallowed up by the
'Namu-amida-bu-sama.'"  
Saichi is now bodily swallowed up by the pill of the six syllables,  
And within the six syllables he leads a life of gratitude.  
His life of gratitude is indeed a mystery,  
The mystery of mysteries this!  
How happy I am with the favor!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 109

Saichi has something good given him,  
The meditation of five Kalpas is given him.  
Where can he have a fit place to store such a big thing?  
The fact is that he is taken into it.  
How grateful I am!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 110

Saichi has something good given him,  
The meditation of five Kalpas is given him.  
Where can he have a fit place to store such a big thing?  
The fact is that he is taken into it.  
How grateful I am! <span id="page_204">p. 204</span>  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 111

"Namu-amida-butsu" is indeed a wonderful Name,  
And I have it as gift.  
It gushes out of Saichi's heart;  
This is as it ought to be:  
The *ki* and *hō* are one in the "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 112

"O Saichi, tell us what kind of taste <span
id="fr_167"></span>[17](#fn_166) is the taste of 'Namu-amida-butsu,  
Tell us what kind of taste is the taste of 'Namu-amida-butsu.'  
"The taste of the 'Namu-amida-butsu' is:  
A joy filling up the bosom,  
A joy filling up the liver,  
Like the rolling swell of the sea--  
No words--just the utterance: Oh, Oh!"

#### 113

There is one thing I wish to learn from Oya-sama:  
How do you wipe out my guilts?  
Carrying my guilts as they are  
\[I am\] borne up by the "Namu-amida-butsu"!  
How grateful I am!  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

#### 114

The three poisonous passions are in company with the
"Namu-amida-butsu,"  
And found working with "Namu-amida-butsu"!  
How thankful I am for the favor!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 115

The love that inspired Oya-sama to go through  
All the sufferings and all the hardships--  
I thought I was simply to listen to the story,  
But that was a grievous mistake, I find.

#### 116

\[What a wonder\] that such a bad man as Saichi whose badness knows no
bounds  
Has been transformed into a Buddha!  
How grateful for the favor, and how happy!  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 117

How wretched I am!  
For us ordinary people human calculations are of no avail.  
As to the estimation of guilts--this is left to Oya-sama.  
How grateful for the favor!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 118

My heart given up to Thee,  
And Thy heart received by me!

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

### 7. THE HEART-SEARCHINGS <span id="fr_168"></span>[18](#fn_167)

#### 119

The *bombu* <span id="fr_169"></span>[19](#fn_168) cannot live with
Buddha,  
Because he has no humility and joy;  
Lives with Buddha--  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 120

Saying "I cannot understand,"  
They seize upon the *bonnō* <span id="fr_170"></span>[20](#fn_169) and
investigate;  
But the *bonnō* is the body of merit;  
This makes me laugh.

#### 121

If there were no wretchedness,  
My life would be wickedness itself;  
How fortunate I am that I was given wretchedness  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

#### 122

When the *bombu* is not understood  
It is wickedness;  
When understood, it is humility--  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 123

Saichi feels within himself  
An endless flow of folly,  
An endless flow of greed;  
There is a fire constantly burning--  
No wonder, this burning,  
For Saichi is an evil spirit.

#### 124

Saichi's heart is all rain,  
Saichi's heart, like rain and rain, is all rain;  
Saichi's heart is all fog, like fog within a fog.  
There is nothing but wretchedness in Saichi's heart.

#### 125

"How wretched I am!"  
This is what we all say when we feel humiliated.  
But this kind of self -humiliation we say now is all a lie.  
\[The real one we say is\] what we say after we've visited the Pure
Land.  
This Saichi's self-humiliation is nothing but a lie, monstrous lie, a
monstrous, monstrous lie!  
And within this lie there is another lie well wrapped!  
How shameful!  
This "How shameful!" is also a lie bursting out of the mouth. <span
id="page_208">p. 208</span>  
This Saichi putting on the mask is most irreverently playing upon the
saintly masters!  
How wretched, how wretched!  
There, there, that Saichi is again putting on the mask!  
There is nothing in this Saichi but going around in disguise and
deceiving everybody;  
How wretched!  
Anything Saichi says is wretchedness itself.  
Even this comes out of the lying lips.  
The only real true thing is Oya-sama, no other there is!  
All my lies have been completely taken away \[by him\],  
\[And there remains nothing but\]  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 126

How did you see your own heart?  
To see the heart, take Amida's mirror.  
How wretched!  
The wretchedness of my heart is like space, it has no limits.  
How wretched!

#### 127

O Saichi, you are a wretched fellow!  
Your stature is hardly five feet,  
And yet your heart runs wildly all over the world.  
Saichi is a wretched man.  
How wretched!

#### 128

They understand who have had sorrows,  
But those who had them not can never understand:<span id="page_209">p.
209</span>  
There is nothing so excruciating as sighs--  
The sighs that refuse to be disposed of.  
But they are removed by Amida,  
And all I can say now is "Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 129

There is no bottom to Saichi's wickedness;  
There is no bottom to Saichi's goodness:  
How happy I am with the favor!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 130

The wretched heart of contrition--  
The thankful heart of joy--  
The "Namu-amida-butsu" of contrition and joy! <span
id="fr_171"></span>[21](#fn_170)

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

### 8. POVERTY <span id="fr_172"></span>[22](#fn_171)

#### 131

Nothing is left to Saichi,  
Except a joyful heart nothing is left to him.  
Neither good nor bad has he, all is taken away from him;  
Nothing is left to him!  
To have nothing--how completely satisfying!  
Everything has been carried away by the "Namu-amida-butsu."  
He is thoroughly at home with himself:  
This is indeed the "Namu-amida-butsu"!

#### 132

My avarice has all been taken away,  
And the world has turned into my "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 133

Everything of mine has been carried away by Thee,  
And Thou hast given me the *Nembutsu*--"Namu-amida-butsu."

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

### 9. THE INNER LIFE <span id="fr_173"></span>[23](#fn_172)

#### 134

To be grateful is all a lie,  
The truth is--there is nothing the matter;  
And beyond this there is no peace of mind--  
"Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu, Namu-amida-butsu!"  
(With this peacefully I retire.)

#### 135

There's nothing with me, nothing's the matter with me  
To have nothing the matter is the "Namu-amida-butsu."

#### 136

That this Saichi is turned into a Buddha,  
Even while I knew nothing of it:  
So I am told.

#### 137

How wretched!  
Wretchedness too is of suchness. <span
id="fr_174"></span>[24](#fn_173)  
How thankful!  
Buddha's favor too is of suchness.  
Both *ki* and *hō* are Oya-sama's work. <span
id="fr_175"></span>[25](#fn_174) <span id="page_212">p. 212</span>  
All out, nothing kept back! <span id="fr_176"></span>[26](#fn_175)  
How grateful for the favor!  
Nothing's left for me to do.  
How grateful for the favor!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 138

As regards myself, nothing is the matter:  
Called by the voice the mind has been made captive,  
And "Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 139

To say, "How grateful!" is a lie;  
The truth is: there is nothing the matter with one;  
And there is nothing more that makes one feel at home--  
"Namu-amida-butsu! Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 140

O Saichi, such as you are, are you grateful?  
Nothing's the matter \[with me\],  
However much I listen \[to the sermons\], nothing's the matter with
me.  
And no inquiries are to be made.

#### 141

Nothing's the matter, nothing's the matter with me;  
That there's nothing the matter--this is the "Namu-amida-butsu."

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

#### 142

To be grateful is not *anjin*; <span id="fr_177"></span>[27](#fn_176)  
Nothing happening is nothing happening.  
To be grateful is a fraud--- <span id="fr_178"></span>[28](#fn_177)  
’Tis true, ’tis true!

#### 143

Whether I'm falling \[to hell\]  
Or bound for the Pure Land--  
I have no knowledge:  
All is left to Amida's Vow.  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 144

Doubts have been taken away--  
I know not how and when!  
How to be thankful for the favor--I know not!  
"Namu-amida-butsu!"

#### 145

I am happy!  
The root of sinfulness <span id="fr_179"></span>[29](#fn_178) is cut
off;  
Though still functioning, it is the same as non-existent.  
How happy I am!  
Born of happiness is the "Namu-amida-butsu."

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

#### 146

"O Saichi, won't you tell us about *Tariki*?"  
"Yes, but there is neither *Tariki* nor *Jiriki*,  
What is, is the graceful acceptance only."

#### 147

Where are Saichi's evil desires gone?  
They are still here:  
I hate, I love, I crave--  
How wretched, how wretched I am!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_150"></span>[175:1](mcb12.htm#fr_151) *Nyorai* is the
Japanese reading for Chinese *ju-lai*, which is the translation of the
Sanskrit *tathāgata*. It means "one who thus comes (or goes)."

<span id="fn_151"></span>[175:2](mcb12.htm#fr_152) *Cf*. Angelus
Silesius, German mystic-poet:

I know that without me  
God can no moment live;  
Were I to die, then He  
No longer could survive.

I am as great as God,  
And He is small like me;  
He cannot be above,  
Nor I below Him be.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[175:3](mcb12.htm#fr_153) The Japanese for
"worship" is *ogamu*, which literally means "to bow to an object
reverentially and devotionally." "Worship" may sound too strong, but if
it is understood in the sense of "religious reverence and homage" as it
is ordinarily done, there is no harm in the use of the term.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[176:4](mcb12.htm#fr_154) Dreamed on the night
of May 22.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[176:5](mcb12.htm#fr_155) *Kimyo* is the
Japanese for *namu*, meaning "taking refuge," "adoration," "worshiping,"
etc. The author here probably intends to mean that mutual worshiping of
Namu and Amida is the meaning of "Namu-amida-butsu," or that
"Namu-amida-butsu" symbolizes the oneness of Amida and every one of us.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[177:6](mcb12.htm#fr_156) *Hokkai* is
*dharmadhātu* in Sanskrit, meaning the universe as the totality of all
things.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[178:7](mcb12.htm#fr_157) *Oya* has no English
equivalent. It is both motherhood and fatherhood, not in their
biological sense but as the symbol of loving-kindness. Sama, an
honorific particle, is sometimes shortened to san which is less formal
and more friendly and intimate.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[179:8](mcb12.htm#fr_158) *Oni* in Japanese,
evil spirits under the King of Death (*yāmarāja*).

<span id="fn_158"></span>[180:9](mcb12.htm#fr_159) Meaning absolute
trust between Amida as Oya-sama and Saichi as child.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[181:10](mcb12.htm#fr_160) This is Saichi
himself. Namu is personified here.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[182:11](mcb12.htm#fr_161) The Nembutsu
(literally "thinking of Buddha") and the *Myōgō* ("name") are often
interchangeable. Both refer to the six syllables:
"*Na-mu-a-mi-da-buts*(*u*)." The syllables serve three purposes: (1) as
the *Myōgō* itself, (2) as an actual invocation, and (3) as the symbol
of identity.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[187:12](mcb12.htm#fr_162) The following
equations hold: the *Ki* = *Jiriki* ("self-power") = the *Namu* = the
supplicating individual = the sinner = Saichi. The *Hō* = Amida = Buddha
= Enlightenment = *Tariki* ("other-power") = Reality = the *Dharma* =
Oya-sama = Tathāgata.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[189:13](mcb12.htm#fr_163) Saichi generally
declares *Namu* to be himself and Amida to be Oya-sama. To identify
himself with both *Namu* and Amida is unusual. We may however remark
that Saichi often equates himself with "Namu-amida-butsu," which means
that he is Amida as well as *Namu*.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[191:14](mcb12.htm#fr_164) Jigoku is hell
generally, *Gokuraku* is the Land of Bliss, *Jōdo* is the Pure Land, and
*shaba* is "this world" or *sahalokadhātu* in Sanskrit.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[191:15](mcb12.htm#fr_165) This does not
necessarily mean that when the eyes are closed which symbolize death we
are in the Pure Land and that while they are kept open we are in this
world. Saichi's idea probably is metaphysical or dialectical, though of
course this is not to say that Saichi has reasoned out all these things
consciously after the fashion of a philosopher. Saichi's allusion to the
eye reminds us of Eckhart's remark on it.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[198:16](mcb12.htm#fr_166) The gift or favor
coming from Amida is a free one, for he never asks anything in exchange
or in compensation. When the sinner (*ki*) utters "Namu-amida-butsu" in
all sincerity he is at once made conscious of his being from the first
with Amida and in Amida. There has never been any sort of alienation or
estrangement between Amida and sinner. It was all due to the latter's
illusive ideas cherished about himself. When they are wiped away, he
realizes that the sun has always been there and finds himself basking in
its light of infinity.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[204:17](mcb12.htm#fr_167) "Taste"--Bible
reference: *Imitation Of Christ*, Chapter XXXIV. "To him who tasteth
Thee, what can be distasteful? And to him who tasteth Thee not, what is
there which can make him joyous?"

<span id="fn_167"></span>[206:18](mcb12.htm#fr_168) While at the moment
of exaltation Saichi feels he is Amida himself in company with Buddhas
and Bodhisattvas who fill the whole universe, there are occasions when
he feels the contrary. He then is the most despicable creature, like a
homeless dog with his tail between the legs. He would cry: "How
wretched, how worthless, how full of 84,000 evil thoughts am I!" But he
never remains long in this state of self-commiseration, for he soon
rises from it triumphantly, praising Buddha's infinite love for him. The
psychologist may take him as a good example of manic-depressive
psychosis. But the trouble is that Saichi is very much saner than most
ordinary minds including scholars. He belongs to the group of
"steadfastness," he has "something" occupying the very core of his being
as Eckhart would say. Students of the religious consciousness know well
that there is something of ambivalence in every devout soul. In this
respect Saichi's utterances are of unusual importance.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[206:19](mcb12.htm#fr_169) *Bombu* is the
unenlightened and stands in contrast to Buddha.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[206:20](mcb12.htm#fr_170) *Kleśa* in Sanskrit,
generally rendered "evil passions." They are the product of ignorance
(*avidyā*) and thirst (*tṛiṣṇā*).

<span id="fn_170"></span>[209:21](mcb12.htm#fr_171) Logically speaking,
this is a case of identity in absolute contradiction. Saichi
demonstrates this experientially. When he is conscious of his
finiteness, being bound to the law of karmic causation, his heart is
filled with contrition. But as soon as he feels that it is because of
this consciousness that he has been taken up in the arms of Oya-sama,
his joy knows no limits. The "Namu-amida-butsu" symbolizes the
unification or rather identification of utter wretchedness and elated
joyfulness.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[210:22](mcb12.htm#fr_172) Poverty means that
all that one thinks to be one's own is taken or carried away by Amida or
Oya-sama, that the self-power (*Jiriki*) finds itself of no avail
whatever. More positively, it is a state of self-realization that Amida
is all in all.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[211:23](mcb12.htm#fr_173) The inner life is
the life of suchness, of *kono-mama*, of the "nothing's the matter," of
the "I know not what," of the horse galloping on the heath (Eckhart), of
the flea in God's is-ness.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[211:24](mcb12.htm#fr_174) The original
Japanese reads, "*onodzukara*," which means "*as-it-is-ness*," "being
natural," "being perfect in itself," or "being sufficient in itself."
This is *kono-mama* or *sono-mama*.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[211:25](mcb12.htm#fr_175) *Hataraki* in the
