# PARABLES & STORIES

THE Blessed One thought: "I have taught the truth which is excellent in
the beginning, excellent in the middle, and excellent in the end; it is
glorious in its spirit and glorious in its letter. But simple as it is,
the people cannot understand it. I must speak to them in their own
language. I must adapt my thoughts to their thoughts. They are like unto
children, and love to hear tales. Therefore, I will tell them stories to
explain the glory of the Dharma. If they cannot grasp the truth in the
abstract arguments by which I have reached it, they may nevertheless
come to understand it, if it is illustrated in parables.
