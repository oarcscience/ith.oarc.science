# ALL EXISTENCE IS SPIRITUAL

THERE was an officer among the retinue of Simha who had heard of the
discourses of the Blessed One, and there was some doubt left in his
heart. This man came to the Blessed One and said: "It is said, O Lord,
that the samana Gotama denies the existence of the soul. Do they who say
so speak the truth, or do they bear false witness against the Blessed
One

And the Blessed One said: "There is a way in which those who say so are
speaking truly of me; on the other hand, there is a way in which those
who say so do not speak truly of me. The Tathagata teaches that there is
no self. He who says that the soul is his self and that the self is the
thinker of our thoughts and the actor of our deeds, teaches a wrong
doctrine which leads to confusion and darkness. On the other hand, the
Tathagata teaches that there is mind. He who understands by soul mind,
and says that mind exists, teaches the truth which leads to clearness
and enlightenment."

The officer said: "Does, then, the Tathagata maintain that two things
exist? that which we perceive with our senses and that which is mental?"

Said the Blessed One: "I say to thee, thy mind is spiritual, but neither
is the sense-perceived void of spirituality. The bodhi is eternal and it
dominates all existence as the good law guiding all beings in their
search for truth. It changes brute nature into mind, and there is no
being that cannot be transformed into a vessel of truth."
