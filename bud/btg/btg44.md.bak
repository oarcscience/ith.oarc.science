# THE VANITY OF WORLDLINESS

THERE was a poet who had acquired the spotless eye of truth, and he
believed in the Buddha, whose doctrine gave him peace of mind and
comfort in the hour of affliction. It happened that an epidemic swept
over the country in which he lived, so that many died, and the people
were terrified. Some of them trembled with fright, and in anticipation
of their fate were smitten with all the horrors of death before they
died, while others began to be merry, shouting loudly, "Let us enjoy
ourselves today, for we know not whether tomorrow we shall live"; yet
was their laughter no genuine gladness, but a mere pretense and
affectation.

Among all these worldly men and women trembling with anxiety, the
Buddhist poet lived in the time of the pestilence, as usual, calm and
undisturbed, helping wherever he could and ministering unto the sick,
soothing their pains by medicine and religious consolation. And a man
came to him and said:

"My heart is nervous and excited, for I see people die. I am not anxious
about others, but I tremble because of myself. Help me; cure me of my
fear."

The poet replied: "There is help for him who has compassion on others,
but there is no help for thee so long as thou clingest to thine own self
alone. Hard times try the souls of men and teach them righteousness and
charity. Canst thou witness these sad sights around thee and still be
filled with selfishness? Canst thou see thy brothers, sisters, and
friends suffer, yet not forget the petty cravings and lust of thine own
heart? Noticing the desolation in the mind of the pleasure-seeking man,
the Buddhist poet composed this song and taught it to the brethren in
the vihara:

"Unless you take refuge in the Buddha and find rest in Nirvana,  
Your life is but vanity-empty and desolate vanity.  
To see the world is idle, and to enjoy life is empty.  
The world, including man, is but like a phantom, and the hope of heaven
is as a mirage.  
"The worldling seeks pleasures, fattening himself like a caged fowl,  
But the Buddhist saint flies up to the sun like the wild crane.  
The fowl in the coop has food but will soon be boiled in the pot;  
No provisions are given to the wild crane, but the heavens and the earth
are his.

The poet said: "The times are hard and teach the people a lesson; yet do
they not heed it." And he composed another poem on the vanity of
worldliness:

"It is good to reform, and it is good to exhort people to reform.  
The things of the world will all be swept away.  
Let others be busy and buried with care.  
My mind all unvexed shall be pure.  
"After pleasures they hanker and find no satisfaction;  
Riches they covet and can never have enough.  
They are like unto puppets held up by a string.  
When the string breaks they come down with a shock.  
"In the domain of death there are neither great nor small;  
Neither gold nor silver is used, nor precious jewels.  
No distinction is made between the high and the low.  
And daily the dead are buried beneath the fragrant sod.  
"Look at the sun setting behind the western hills.  
You lie down to rest, but soon the cock will announce morn.  
Reform today and do not wait until it be too late  
Do not say it is early, for the time quickly passes by.  
"It is good to reform and it is good to exhort people to reform.  
It is good to lead a righteous life and take refuge in the Buddha's
name.  
Your talents may reach to the skies, your wealth may be untold-  
But all is in vain unless you attain the peace of Nirvana."
