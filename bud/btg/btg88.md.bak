# THE PATIENT ELEPHANT

WHILE the Blessed One was residing in the Jetavana, there was a
householder living in Savatthi known to all his neighbors as patient and
kind, but his relatives were wicked and contrived a plot to rob him. One
day they came to the householder and by worrying him with all kinds of
threats took away a goodly portion of his property. He did not go to
court, nor did he complain, but tolerated with great forbearance the
wrongs he suffered. The neighbors wondered and began to talk about it,
and rumors of the affair reached the ears of the brethren in Jetavana.
While the brethren discussed the occurrence in the assembly hall, the
Blessed One entered and asked "What was the topic of your conversation?"
And they told him.

Said the Blessed One: "The time will come when the wicked relatives will
find their punishment. O brethren, this is not the first time that this
occurrence took place; it has happened before," and he told them a
world-old tale: Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares,
the Bodhisattva was born in the Himalaya region as an elephant. He grew
up strong and big, and ranged the hills and mountains, the peaks and
caves of the torturous woods in the valleys. Once as he went he saw a
pleasant tree, and took his food, standing under it. Then some
impertinent monkeys came down out of the tree, and jumping on the
elephant's back, insulted and tormented him greatly; they took hold of
his tusks, pulled his tail and disported themselves, thereby causing him
much annoyance. The Bodhisattva, being full of patience, kindliness and
mercy, took no notice at all of their misconduct which the monkeys
repeated again and again.

"One day the spirit that lived in the tree, standing upon the
tree-trunk, addressed the elephant saying, 'My lord elephant, why dost
thou put up with the impudence of these bad monkeys?' And he asked the
question in a couplet as follows:

"'Why do you patiently endure each freak  
These mischievous and selfish monkeys wreak?'

"The Bodhisattva, on hearing this, replied, If, Tree sprite, I cannot
endure these monkeys' ill treatment without abusing their birth, lineage
and persons, how can I walk in the eightfold noble path? But these
monkeys will do the same to others thinking them to be like me. If they
do it to any rogue elephant, he will punish them indeed, and I shall be
delivered both from their annoyance and the guilt of having done harm to
others.' Saying this he repeated another stanza:

"If they will treat another one like me,  
He will destroy them; and I shall be free.

"A few days after, the Bodhisattva went elsewhere, and another elephant,
a savage beast, came and stood in his place. The wicked monkeys thinking
him to be like the old one, climbed upon his back and did as before. The
rogue elephant seized the monkeys with his trunk, threw them upon the
ground, gored them with his tusk and trampled them to mincemeat under
his feet."

When the Master had ended this teaching, he declared the truths, and
identified the births, saying: "At that time the mischievous monkeys
were the wicked relatives of the good man, the rogue elephant was the
one who will punish them, but the virtuous noble elephant was the
Tathagata himself in a former incarnation."

After this discourse one of the brethren rose and asked leave to propose
a question and when the permission was granted he said: "I have heard
the doctrine that wrong should be met with wrong and the evil doer
should be checked by being made to suffer, for if this were not done
evil would increase and good would disappear. What shall we do?" Said
the Blessed One: "Nay, I will tell you You who have left the world and
have adopted this glorious faith of putting aside selfishness, you shall
not do evil for evil nor return hate for hate. Neither think that you
can destroy wrong by retaliating evil for evil and thus increasing
wrong. Leave the wicked to their fate and their evil deeds will sooner
or later in one way or another bring on their own punishment." And the
Tathagata repeated these stanzas:

"Who harms the man who does no harm,  
Or strikes at him who strikes him not,  
Shall soon some punishment incur  
Which his own wickedness begot,-  
"One of the gravest ills in life,  
Either a loathsome dread disease,  
Or sad old age, or loss of mind,  
Or wretched pain without surcease,  
"Or conflagration, loss of wealth;  
Or of his nearest kin he shall  
See some one die that's dear to him,  
And then he'll be reborn in hell."
