# THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD

THERE was a certain Brahman in Kosambi, a wrangler and well versed in
the Vedas. As he found no one whom he regarded his equal in debate he
used to carry a lighted torch in his hand, and when asked for the reason
of his strange conduct, he replied: 'The world is so dark that I carry
this torch to light it up, as far as I can." A samana sitting in the
market-place heard these words and said: "My friend, if thine eyes are
blind to the sight of the omnipresent light of the day, do not call the
world dark. Thy torch adds nothing to the glory of the sun and thy
intention to illumine the minds of others is as futile as it is
arrogant." Whereupon the Brahman asked: "Where is the sun of which thou
speakest?" And the samana replied: "The wisdom of the Tathagata is the
sun of the mind. His radiancy is glorious by day and night, and he whose
faith is strong will not lack light on the path to Nirvana where he will
inherit bliss everlasting."
