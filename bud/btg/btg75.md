# THE SOWER

BHARADVAJA, a wealthy Brahman farmer, was celebrating his
harvest-thanksgiving when the Blessed One came with his alms-bowl,
begging for food. Some of the people paid him reverence, but the Brahman
was angry and said: "O samana, it would be more fitting for thee to go
to work than to beg. I plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, I
eat. If thou didst likewise, thou, too, wouldst have something to eat."

The Tathagata answered him and said: "O Brahman, if too, plough and sow,
and having ploughed and sown, I eat." "Dost thou profess to be a
husbandman?" replied the Brahman. "Where, then, are thy bullocks? Where
is the seed and the plough?"

The Blessed One said: "Faith is the seed I sow: good works are the rain
that fertilizes it; wisdom and modesty are the plough; my mind is the
guiding-rein; I lay hold of the handle of the law; earnestness is the
goad I use, and exertion is my draught-ox. This ploughing is ploughed to
destroy the weeds of illusion. The harvest it yields is the immortal
fruits of Nirvana, and thus all sorrow ends." Then the Brahman poured
rice-milk into a golden bowl and offered it to the Blessed One, saying:
"Let the Teacher of mankind partake of the rice-milk, for the venerable
Gotama ploughs a ploughing that bears the fruit of immortality."
