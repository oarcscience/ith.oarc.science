# THE FIRST CONVERTS

THE Blessed One tarried in solitude seven times seven days, enjoying the
bliss of emancipation. At that time Tapussa and Bhallika, two merchants,
came traveling on the road near by, and when they saw the great samana,
majestic and full of peace, they approached him respectfully and offered
him rice cakes and honey.

This was the first food that the Enlightened One ate after he attained
Buddhahood.

And the Buddha addressed them and pointed out to them the way of
salvation. The two merchants, seeing the holiness of the conqueror of
Mara, bowed down in reverence and said: "We take our refuge, Lord, in
the Blessed One and in the Dharma." Tapussa and Bhallika were the first
that became followers of the Buddha and they were lay disciples.
