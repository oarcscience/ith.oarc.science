# THE LISTLESS FOOL

THERE was a rich Brahman, well advanced in years, who, unmindful of the
impermanence of earthly things and anticipating a long life, had built
himself a large house. The Buddha wondered why a man so near to death
had built a mansion with so many apartments, and he sent Ananda to the
rich Brahman to preach to him the four noble truths and the eightfold
path of salvation. The Brahman showed Ananda his house and explained to
him the purpose of its numerous chambers, but to the instruction of the
Buddha's teachings he gave no heed. Ananda said: "It is the habit of I
fools to say, 'I have children and wealth.' He who says so is not even
master of himself; how can he claim possession of children, riches, and
servants? Many are the anxieties of the worldly, but they know nothing
of the changes of the future."

Scarcely had Ananda left, when the old man was stricken with apoplexy
and fell dead. The Buddha said, for the instruction of those who were
ready, to learn: "A fool, though he live in the company of the wise,
understands nothing of the true doctrine, as a spoon tastes not the
flavor of the soup. He thinks of himself only, and unmindful of the
advice of good counselors is unable to deliver himself."
