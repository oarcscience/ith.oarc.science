# THE PEACEMAKER

IT is reported that two kingdoms were on the verge of war for the
possession of a certain embankment which was disputed by them. And the
Buddha seeing the kings and their armies ready to fight, requested them
to tell him the cause of their quarrels. Having heard the complaints on
both sides, he said:

"I understand that the embankment has value for some of your people; has
it any intrinsic value aside from its service to your men?"

"It has no intrinsic value whatever was the reply.

The Tathagata continued: "Now when you go to battle is it not sure that
many of your men will be slain and that you yourselves, O kings, are
liable to lose your lives?" And they said: "It is sure that many will be
slain and our own lives be jeopardized."

"The blood of men, however," said Buddha, "has it less intrinsic value
than a mound of earth?" "No," the kings said, "The lives of men and
above all the lives of kings, are priceless." Then the Tathagata
concluded: care you going to stake that which is priceless against that
which has no intrinsic value whatever?--The wrath of the two monarchs
abated, and they came to a peaceable agreement.
