# THE SERMON AT RAJAGAHA

THE Blessed One having dwelt some time in Uruvela went to Rajagaha,
accompanied by a number of bhikkhus, many of whom had been Jatilas
before. The great Kassapa, chief of the Jatilas and formerly a fire
worshiper, went with him.

When the Magadha king, Seniya Bimbisara, heard of the arrival of Gotama
Sakyamuni, of whom the people said, "He is the Holy One, the blessed
Buddha, guiding men as a driver curbs bullocks, the teacher of high and
low," he went out surrounded with his counselors and generals and came
to the grove where the Blessed One was. There they saw the Blessed One
in the company of Kassapa, the great religious teacher of the Jatilas,
and they were astonished and thought: "Has the great Sakyamuni placed
himself under the spiritual direction of Kassapa, or has Kassapa become
a disciple of Gotama?"

The Tathagata, reading the thoughts of the people, said to Kassapa:
"What knowledge hast thou gained, O Kassapa, and what has induced thee
to renounce the sacred fire and give up thine austere penances?"

Kassapa said: "The profit I derived from adoring the fire was
continuance in the wheel of individuality with all its sorrows and
vanities. This service I have cast away, and instead of continuing
penances and sacrifices I have gone in quest of the highest Nirvana.
Since I have seen the light of truth, I have abandoned worshiping the
fire."

The Buddha, perceiving that the whole assembly was ready as a vessel to
receive the doctrine, spoke thus to Bimbisara the king: "He who knows
the nature of self and understands how the senses act, finds no room for
selfishness, and thus he will attain peace unending. The world holds the
thought of self, and from this arises false apprehension. Some say that
the self endures after death, some say it perishes. Both are wrong and
their error is most grievous. For if they say the self is perishable,
the fruit they strive for will perish too, and at some time there will
be no hereafter. Good and evil would be indifferent. This salvation from
selfishness is without merit.

"When some, on the other hand, say the self will not perish, then in the
midst of all life and death there is but one identity unborn and
undying. If such is their self, then it is perfect and cannot be
perfected by deeds. The lasting, imperishable self could never be
changed. self would be lord and master, and there would be no use in
perfecting the perfect; moral aims and salvation would be unnecessary.

"But now we see the marks of joy and sorrow. Where is any constancy? If
there is no permanent self that does our deeds, then there is no self;
there is no actor behind our actions, no perceiver behind our
perception, no lord behind our deeds.

"Now attend and listen: The senses meet the object and from their
contact sensation is born. Thence results recollection. Thus, as the
sun's power through a burning-glass causes fire to appear, so through
the cognizance born of sense and object, the mind originates and with it
the ego, the thought of self, whom some Brahman teachers call the lord.
The shoot springs from the seed; the seed is not the shoot; both are not
one and the same, but successive phases in a continuous growth. Such is
the birth of animated life.

"Ye that are slaves of the self and toil in its service from morn until
night, ye that live in constant fear of birth, old age, sickness, and
death, receive the good tidings that your cruel master exists not. Self
is an error, an illusion, a dream. Open your eyes and awaken. See things
as they are and ye will be comforted. He who is awake will no longer be
afraid of nightmares. He who has recognized the nature of the rope that
seemed to be a serpent will cease to tremble.

"He who has found there is no self will let go all the lusts and desires
of egotism. The cleaving to things, covetousness, and sensuality
inherited from former existences, are the causes of the misery and
vanity in the world. Surrender the grasping disposition of selfishness,
and you will attain to that calm state of mind which conveys perfect
peace, goodness, and wisdom."

And the Buddha breathed forth this solemn utterance:

"Do not deceive, do not despise  
Each other, anywhere.  
Do not be angry, and do not  
Secret resentment bear;  
For as a mother risks her life  
And watches over her child,  
So boundless be your love to all,  
So tender, kind and mild.  
"Yea cherish good-will right and left,  
For all, both soon and late,  
And with no hindrance, with no stint,  
From envy free and hate;  
While standing, walking, sitting down,  
Forever keep in mind:  
The rule of life that's always best  
Is to be loving-kind.

"Gifts are great, the founding of viharas is meritorious, meditations
and religious exercises pacify the heart, comprehension of the truth
leads to Nirvana, but greater than all is loving-kindness. As the light
of the moon is sixteen times stronger than the light of all the stars,
so loving-kindness is sixteen times more efficacious in liberating the
heart than all other religious accomplishments taken together. This
state of heart is the best in the world. Let a man remain steadfast in
it while he is awake, whether he is standing, walking, sitting, or lying
down."

When the Enlightened One had finished his sermon, the Magadha king said
to the Blessed One: "In former days, Lord, when I was a prince, I
cherished five wishes. I wished: O, that I might be inaugurated as a
king. This was my first wish, and it has been fulfilled. Further, I
wished: Might the Holy Buddha, the Perfect One, appear on earth while I
rule and might he come to my kingdom. This was my second wish and it is
fulfilled now. Further I wished: Might I pay my respects to him. This
was my third wish and it is fulfilled now. The fourth wish was: Might
the Blessed One preach the doctrine to me, and this is fulfilled now.

"The greatest wish, however, was the fifth wish: Might I understand the
doctrine of the Blessed One. And this wish is fulfilled too.

"Glorious Lord! Most glorious is the truth preached by the Tathagata!
Our Lord, the Buddha, sets up what has been overturned; he reveals what
has been hidden; he points out the way to the wanderer who has gone
astray; he lights a lamp in the darkness so that those who have eyes to
see may see. I take my refuge in the Buddha. I take my refuge in the
Dharma. I take my refuge in the Sangha."

The Tathagata, by the exercise of his virtue and by wisdom, showed his
unlimited spiritual power. He subdued and harmonized all minds. He made
them see and accept the truth, and throughout the kingdom the seeds of
virtue were sown.
