# THE MAN BORN BLIND

THERE was a man born blind, and he said: "I do not believe in the world
of light and appearance. There are no colors, bright or somber. There is
no sun, no moon, no stars. No one has witnessed these things." His
friends remonstrated with him, but he clung to his opinion: "What you
say that you see," he objected, "are illusions. If colors existed I
should be able to touch them. They have no substance and are not real.
Everything real has weight, but I feel no weight where you see colors."

A physician was called to see the blind man. He mixed four simples, and
when he applied them to the cataract of the blind man the gray film
melted, and his eyes acquired the faculty of sight. The Tathagata is the
physician, the cataract is the illusion of the thought "I am," and the
four simples are the four noble truths.
