# IN SEARCH OF A THIEF

HAVING sent out his disciples, the Blessed One himself wandered from
place to place until he reached Uruvela. On his way he sat down in a
grove to rest, and it happened that in that same grove was a party of
thirty friends who were enjoying themselves with their wives; and while
they were sporting, some of their goods were stolen. Then the whole
party went in search of the thief and, meeting the Blessed One sitting
under a tree, saluted him and said: "Pray, Lord, didst thou see the
thief pass by with our goods?"

And the Blessed One said: "Which is better for you, that you go in
search for the thief or for yourselves?" And the youths cried: "In
search for ourselves!"

"Well then," said the Blessed One "sit down and I will preach the truth
to you." And the whole party sat down and they listened eagerly to the
words of the Blessed One. Having grasped the truth, they praised the
doctrine and took refuge in the Buddha.
