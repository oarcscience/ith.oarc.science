This is a translation of a series of dialogues between King Milinda
and Nagasena, a Buddhist scholar.
<CITE>The Questions of King Milinda</CITE>
deals with some of the thorniest questions of Buddhism,
religion and existence.
The narrative proceeds in a cyclical fashion as the King proposes
a difficult question of Nagasena, who responds typically
with either a tale about the Buddha in some previous life,
or an analogy.
The book represents Southern Buddhism at an advanced stage of development.
While difficult questions are addressed here, <CITE>Milinda</CITE>
makes fascinating reading, as many of the issues are common to all religions.

These volumes were reprinted by Dover publications in 1963; unfortunately
the Dover edition is now out of print; you may be able to find
used copies, however.
