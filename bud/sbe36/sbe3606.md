# BOOK IV. CHAPTER 8.

\[DILEMMA THE SEVENTY-FIRST.  
VESSANTARA'S GIVING <span id="fr_293"></span>[1](#fn_291.md).\]

1\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, do all the Bodisats give away their wives and
children, or was it only Vessantara the king who did so?'

'All of them do so, not Vessantara only.'

\[**275**\] 'Do they then give them away with their own consent?'

'The wife, O king, was a consenting party. But the children, by reason
of their tender age, lamented. Had they thoroughly understood, they too
would have approved.'

'A hard thing, Nâgasena, was it that the Bodisat carried out, in that he
gave away his own children, his only ones, dearly beloved, into slavery
to the Brahman. And this second action was harder still, that he bound
his own children, his only ones, and dearly beloved, young and tender
though they were, with the jungle rope, and then, when he saw them being
dragged along <span id="fr_294"></span>[2](#fn_292.md) by the
Brahman,--their hands

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

bruised by the creeper,--yet could look on at the sight. And this third
action was even harder still, that when his boy ran back to him, after
loosing the bonds by his own exertion, then he bound him again with the
jungle rope and again gave him away. And this fourth action was even
harder still, that when the children, weeping, cried: "Father dear, this
ogre is leading us away to eat us!" he should have appeased them by
saying: "Don't be afraid." And this fifth action was even harder still,
that when the prince, *G*âli, fell weeping at his feet, and besought
him, saying: "Be satisfied, father dear, only keep Ka*n*hâginâ (his
little sister). I will go away with the ogre. Let him eat me!"--that
even then he would not yield. And this sixth action was even harder
still, that when the boy *G*âli, lamenting, exclaimed: "Have you a heart
of stone then, father, that you can look upon us, miserable, being led
away by the ogre into the dense and haunted jungle, and not call us
back?"--that he still had no pity. And this seventh action was even
harder still, that when his children were thus led away to nameless
horrors until they passed gradually to their bitter fate <span
id="fr_295"></span>[1](#fn_293.md), out of sight--that then his heart did
not break, utterly break! What, pray, has the man who seeks to gain
merit to do with bringing sorrow on others! Should he not rather give
himself away?'

2\. 'It is because what he did, O king, was so

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

difficult, that the sound of the fame of the Bodisat was spread abroad
among gods and men through the ten thousand world systems--\[**276**\]
that the gods exalt him in heaven; and the Titans in the Titan-world,
and the Garu*d*as in their abodes, and the Nâgas in the Nâga-world, and
the Yakshas where they dwell--that through the ages the reputation of
this his glory has been handed down by successive tradition--till now,
to-day, it has reached to this meeting of ours, at which we sitting are,
forsooth, disparaging and casting a slur on that gift <span
id="fr_296"></span>[1](#fn_294.md), debating whether it were well given or
ill! But that high praise, O king, shows forth the ten great qualities
of the intelligent, and wise, and able, and subtle-minded Bodisats. And
what are the ten? Freedom from greed, the not clinging (to any worldly
aim), self-sacrifice, renunciation, the never turning back again (to the
lower state), the equal delicacy and greatness, the incomprehensibility,
the rarity, and the peerlessness of Buddhahood. In all these respects is
it that the fame of that giving shows forth the great qualities of the
Bodisats.'

3\. 'What, venerable Nâgasena? he who gives gifts in such a way as to
bring sorrow upon others--does that giving of his bring forth fruit in
happiness, does it lead to rebirth in states of bliss?'

'Yes, O king. What can be said (to the contrary)?'

'I pray you, Nâgasena, give me a reason for this.'

'Suppose, O king, there were some virtuous Sama*n*a or Brahman, of high
character, and he were

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

paralysed, or a cripple <span id="fr_297"></span>[1](#fn_295.md), or
suffering from some disease or other, and some man desirous of merit
were to have him put into a carriage, and taken to the place he wished
to go to. Would happiness accrue to that man by reason thereof, would
that be an act leading to rebirth in states of bliss?'

'Yes, Sir. What can be said (to the contrary)? That man would thereby
acquire a trained elephant, or a riding-horse, or a bullock-carriage, on
land a land-vehicle and on water a water-vehicle, in heaven a vehicle of
the gods <span id="fr_298"></span>[2](#fn_296.md) and on earth one that men
could use,--from birth to birth there would accrue to him that which in
each would be appropriate and fit,--and joys appropriate would come to
him, and he would pass from state to state of bliss, and by the efficacy
of that act mounting on the vehicle of Iddhi he would arrive at the
longed-for goal, the city of Nirvâ*n*a itself.'

'But then, O king, a gift given in such a way as to bring sorrow upon
others does bring forth fruit in happiness, does lead to rebirth in
states of bliss \[**277**\],--inasmuch as that man by putting the
cart-bullocks to pain would attain such bliss.

4\. 'And hear another reason, O king, for the same thing. Suppose some
monarch were to raise from his subjects a righteous tax, and then by the
issue of a command were to bestow thereout a gift, would that monarch, O
king, enjoy any happiness on that account, would that be a gift leading
to rebirth in states of bliss

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

'Certainly, Sir. What can be said against it? On that account the
monarch would receive a hundred thousandfold, he might become a king of
kings, a god above the gods, or Brahmâ lord of the Brahmâ gods, or a
chief among the Samanas, or a leader of the Brahmans, or the most
excellent among the Arahats.'

'Then, O king, a gift given in such a way as to bring sorrow upon others
does bring forth fruit in happiness, does lead to rebirth in states of
bliss--inasmuch as that monarch by giving as a gift what was gained by
harassing his people with taxation would enjoy such exceeding fame and
glory.'

5\. 'But, venerable Nâgasena, what was given by Vessantara the king was
an excessive gift; in that he gave his own wife as wife to another man,
and his own children, his only ones, into slavery to a Brahman. And
excessive giving is by the wise in the world held worthy of censure and
of blame. Just, Nâgasena, as under too much weight the axle-tree of a
cart would break, or a ship would sink, as his food would disagree with
him who ate too much, or the crops would be ruined by too heavy rain, or
bankruptcy would follow too lavish generosity, or fever would come from
too much heat, or a man would go mad from excessive lust, or become
guilty of an offence through excessive anger, or fall into sin through
excessive stupidity, or into the power of robbers through too much
avarice, or be ruined by needless fear, or as a river would overflow
through excessive inflow, or a thunderbolt fall through too much wind,
or porridge boil over through too hot a fire, or a man who wandered

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

about too much <span id="fr_299"></span>[1](#fn_297.md) would not live
long-just, so, Nâgasena, is excessive giving held by the wise in the
world as worthy of censure and of blame. And as king Vessantara's gift
was excessive \[**278**\] no good result could be expected from it.'

6\. 'Giving exceedingly <span id="fr_300"></span>[2](#fn_298.md), O king,
is praised, applauded, and approved by the wise in the world; and they
who give away anything as a gift just as it may occur to them <span
id="fr_301"></span>[3](#fn_299.md), acquire fame in the world as very
generous givers. Just, O king, as when a man has taken hold of a wild
root which by its extraordinary virtues is divine, that moment he
becomes invisible even to those standing within arm's length--just as a
medicinal herb by the exceeding power of its nature will utterly kill
pain, and put an end to disease--just as fire burns by its exceeding
heat, and water puts that fire out by its exceeding cold--just as by its
exceeding purity a lotus remains undefiled by water or by mud--just as a
(magic) gem by the extraordinary virtue inherent in it procures the
granting of every wish--just as lightning by its marvellous quick
sharpness cleaves asunder even the diamonds, pearls, and crystals--just
as the earth by its exceeding size can support men, and snakes, and wild
beasts, and birds, and the waters,

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

and rocks, and hills, and trees--just as the ocean by its exceeding
greatness can never be quite filled--just as Sineru by its mighty weight
remains immoveable, and space by the greatness of its wide extent is
infinite, and the sun by its mighty glory dissipates the darkness--just
as the lion in the greatness of its lineage is free from fear--just as a
wrestler in the greatness of his might easily lifts up his foe-just as a
king by the excellence of his justice becomes overlord, and a Bhikkhu by
reason of his very righteousness becomes an object of reverence to
Nâgas, and Yakshas, and men, and Mâras--just as a Buddha by the
excellence of his supremacy is peerless--just so, O king, is exceeding
generosity praised, applauded, and approved by the wise in the world;
and they who give away anything as a gift, just as it may occur to them,
acquire in the world the fame of being nobly generous. And by his mighty
giving Vessantara the king, O king, was praised, and lauded, and
exalted, and magnified, and famous throughout the ten thousand world
systems, and by reason, too, of that mighty giving is it that he, the
king Vessantara, has, now in our days, become the Buddha, the chief of
gods and men.

7\. 'And now, O king, tell me--is there anything in the world which
should be withheld as a gift, and not bestowed, when one worthy of a
gift, one to whom it is one's duty to give <span
id="fr_302"></span>[1](#fn_300.md), is there?'

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

'There are ten sorts of gifts, Nâgasena, in the world that are commonly
disapproved of as gifts. And what are the ten? Strong drink, Nâgasena,
and festivals in high places <span id="fr_303"></span>[1](#fn_301.md), and
women, and buffaloes, and suggestive \[**279**\] paintings <span
id="fr_304"></span>[2](#fn_302.md), and weapons, and poison, and chains,
and fowls, and swine, and false weights and measures. All these,
Nâgasena, are disapproved of in the world as gifts, and those who give
such presents become liable to rebirth in states of woe.'

'I did not ask you, O king, what kinds of gifts are not approved of. But
this, O king, I asked: "Is there anything in the world which ought to be
withheld, and not bestowed as a gift, if one worthy of a gift were
present?"'

'No, Sir. When faith arises in their hearts some give food to those
worthy of gifts, and some give clothes, and some give bedding, and some
give dwellings, and some give mats or robes, and some give slave girls
or slaves, and some give fields or premises, and some give bipeds or
quadrupeds, and

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

some give a hundred <span id="fr_305"></span>[1](#fn_303.md) or a thousand
or a hundred thousand, and some give the kingdom itself, and some give
away even their own life.'

'But then, O king, if some give away even their own lives, why do you so
violently attack <span id="fr_306"></span>[2](#fn_304.md) Vessantara, that
king of givers, for the virtuous bestowal of his child and wife? Is
there not a general practice in the world, an acknowledged custom,
according to which it is allowable for a father who has fallen into
debt, or lost his livelihood, to deposit <span
id="fr_307"></span>[3](#fn_305.md) his son in pledge, or sell him?'

'Yes, that is so.'

'Well, in accordance therewith was it that Vessantara, O king, in
suffering and distress at not having obtained the insight of the
Omniscient Ones, pledged and sold his wife and children for that
spiritual treasure. So that he gave away what other people had given
away, he did what other people had done. Why then do you, O king, so
violently attack him, the king of givers?'

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

8\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, I don't blame him for giving, but for not
having made a barter <span id="fr_308"></span>[1](#fn_306.md) with the
beggar, and given away himself rather, instead of his wife and
children.'

\[**280**\] 'That, O king, would be an act of a wrong doer, to give
himself when he was asked for his wife and children. For the thing asked
for, whatever it is, is that which ought to be given. And such is the
practice of the good. Suppose, O king, a man were to ask that water
should be brought, would any one who then brought him food have done
what he wanted?'

'No, Sir. The man who should have given what he first asked to be
brought would have done what he wanted.'

'Just so, O king, when the Brahman asked Vessantara the king for his
wife and children, it was his wife and children that he gave. If the
Brahman, O king, had asked for Vessantara's body, then would Vessantara
have not saved his body, he would neither have trembled nor been stained
(by the love of self), but would have given away and abandoned his own
body. If, O king, any one had come up to Vessantara the king, and asked
of him, saying: "Become my slave," then would he have given away and
abandoned his own self, and in so giving would he have felt no pain.

9\. 'Now the life of king Vessantara, O king, was a good thing shared in
by many--just as meats when cooked are shared in by many, or as a tree
covered with fruit is shared in by many flocks of

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

birds. And why so? Because he had said to himself: "Thus acting may I
attain to Buddhahood." As a man in need, O king, who is wandering about
in his search after wealth, will have to pass along goat-tracks, and
through jungles full of stakes and sticks <span
id="fr_309"></span>[1](#fn_307.md), and doing merchandise by sea and land,
will devote his actions, words, and thoughts to the attainment of
wealth--just so, O king, did Vessantara, the king of givers, who was
longing for the treasure of Buddhahood, for the attainment of the
insight of the Omniscient Ones, by offering up to anyone who begged of
him his property and his corn, his slave girls and his slaves, his
riding animals and carriages, all that he possessed, his wife and
children and himself, seek after the Supreme Enlightenment. Just, O
king, as an official who is anxious for the seal <span
id="fr_310"></span>[2](#fn_308.md), and for the office of the custody
thereof \[**281**\], will exert himself to the attainment of the seal by
sacrificing everything in his house--property and corn, gold and silver,
everything--just so, O king, did Vessantara, the king of givers, by
giving away all that he had, inside his house and out <span
id="fr_311"></span>[3](#fn_309.md), by giving even his life for others,
seek after the Supreme Enlightenment.

10\. 'And further, O king, Vessantara, the king of givers, thought thus:
"It is by giving to him precisely what he asks for, that I shall be of
service

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

to the Brahman:" and therefore did he bestow upon him his wife and
children. It was not, O king, out of dislike to them that he gave them
away, not because he did not care to see them more, not because he
considered them an encumbrance or thought he could no longer support
them, not (in annoyance) with the wish of being relieved of what was not
pleasant to him--but because the jewel treasure of omniscience was dear
to him, for the sake of the insight of the Omniscient Ones, did he
bestow that glorious gift,--immeasurable, magnificent, unsurpassed--of
what was near and dear to him, greatly beloved, cherished as his own
life, his own children and his wife! For it has been said, O king, by
the Blessed One, the god of gods, in the *K*ariyâ Pi*t*aka <span
id="fr_312"></span>[1](#fn_310.md):

"'Twas not through hatred <span id="fr_313"></span>[2](#fn_311.md) of my
children sweet,  
'Twas not through hatred of my queen, Maddî,  
Thraller of hearts <span id="fr_314"></span>[3](#fn_312.md)--not that I
loved them less--  
But Buddhahood more, that I renounced them all."

 

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

'Now at that time, O king, Vessantara, when he had given away his wife
and children, entered the leaf hut, and sat down there. And heavy grief
fell upon him distressed by his exceeding love for them, and his very
heart <span id="fr_315"></span>[1](#fn_313.md) became hot, and hot breath,
too much to find its way through the nose, came and went through his
mouth, and tears rolled in drops of blood from his eyes. Such was the
grief, O king, with which Vessantara gave to the Brahman his wife and
children in the thought that his practice of giving should not be broken
in upon. But there were two reasons, O king, why he thus gave them away.
What are those two? That his practice of giving should not be
interrupted was one; the other was that as a result of his so doing his
children, distressed by living with him only on wild roots and fruits,
should eventually be set free by their new master. \[**282**\] For
Vessantara knew, O king: "No one is capable of keeping my children as
slaves. Their grandfather will ransom the children, and so they will
come back to me." These are the two reasons why he gave his children
away to the Brahman.

12\. 'And further, O king, Vessantara knew:

"This Brahman is worn out, aged, well stricken in years, weak and
broken, leaning on a stick, he has drawn near the end of his days, his
merit is small, he will not be capable of keeping my children as

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

slaves." Would a man be able, O king, by his ordinary power, to seize
the moon and the sun <span id="fr_316"></span>[1](#fn_314.md),

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

mighty and powerful as they are, keeping them in a basket or a box, to
use them, deprived of their light, as plates?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'Neither, O king, could any one whatever keep in use, as his slaves, the
children of Vessantara, who were to the world like the moon and the sun
in glory.

13\. 'And hear another reason, O king, for the same thing <span
id="fr_317"></span>[1](#fn_315.md). That wondrous gem, O king of a sovran
overlord, bright and beautiful, with its eight facets so well cut, four
cubits in thickness, and in circumference <span
id="fr_318"></span>[2](#fn_316.md) as the nave of a cart-wheel, could no
man, wrapping it up in a cloth and putting it into a basket, keep and
use as a hone <span id="fr_319"></span>[3](#fn_317.md) to grind his
scissors <span id="fr_320"></span>[4](#fn_318.md) upon. And neither, O
king, could any one soever keep in use, as his slaves, the children of
Vessantara, like to the jewels of the lord of the world in glory.

14\. 'And hear, O king, another reason. just as the elephant king
Uposatha <span id="fr_321"></span>[5](#fn_319.md), gentle and handsome,
eight cubits in height and nine in girth and length, showing the signs
of rut in three places on his body, all white, sevenfold firm <span
id="fr_322"></span>[6](#fn_320.md), could never by any one

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

be covered up with a saucer <span id="fr_323"></span>[1](#fn_321.md) or a
winnowing fan <span id="fr_324"></span>[1](#fn_321.md), could never be put
into a cowpen like a calf, or made use of as one \[**283**\]; just so
could no one whatever keep in use, as his slaves, the children of
Vessantara, who were, in the world, like Uposatha the elephant king.

15\. 'And hear, O king, another reason. Just, O king, as the mighty
ocean is great in length and breadth, and deep, not to be measured, and
hard to cross, impossible to fathom or to cover up, and no one could
close it in and make use of it as a single ferry, just so could no one
whatever keep in use, as his slaves, the children of Vessantara, as
esteemed in the world as the mighty ocean.

16\. 'And hear another reason, O king. Just as the Himâlaya, the king of
the mountains, five leagues high, and three thousand leagues in extent
at the circumference, with its ranges of eight and forty thousand peaks,
the source of five hundred rivers, the dwelling-place of multitudes of
mighty--creatures <span id="fr_325"></span>[2](#fn_322.md), the producer of
manifold perfumes, enriched with hundreds of magical drugs, is seen to
rise aloft, like a cloud, in the centre (of the earth); like it, O king,
could no one whatever keep in use, as his slaves, the children of
Vessantara, as esteemed in the world as Himâlaya, the mountain king.

'And hear another reason, O king. Just as a

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

mighty bonfire burning on a mountain top would be visible afar off in
the darkness and the gloom of night, so was Vessantara the king well
known among men, and therefore could no one whatever keep in use, as his
slaves, the children of so distinguished a man--for just as at the time
of the flowering of the Nâga trees <span id="fr_326"></span>[1](#fn_323.md)
in the Himâlaya mountains, when the soft winds (of spring) <span
id="fr_327"></span>[2](#fn_324.md) are blowing, the perfume of the flowers
is wafted for ten leagues, or for twelve \[**284**\], so was the sound
of the fame of king Vessantara noised abroad, and the sweet perfume of
his righteousness wafted along for thousands of leagues, even up to the
abodes of the Akani*tth*a, (the highest of all) gods, passing on its way
the dwelling places of the gods and Asuras, of the Garudas and
Gandhabbas, of the Yakshas and Râkshasas, of the Mahoragas and Kinnaras,
and of Indra the monarch of the gods <span
id="fr_328"></span>[3](#fn_325.md)! Therefore is it that no one could keep
his children as slaves.

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

17\. 'And the young prince *G*âli, O king, was instructed by his father,
Vessantara, in these words: "When your grandfather, my child, shall
ransom you with wealth that he gives to the Brahman, let him buy you
back for a thousand ounces of gold <span
id="fr_329"></span>[1](#fn_326.md), and when he ransoms your sister
Ka*n*hâ*g*inâ let him buy her back for a hundred slaves and a hundred
slave girls and a hundred elephants and a hundred horses and a hundred
cows and a hundred buffaloes and a hundred ounces of gold. And if, my
child, your grandfather should take you out of the hands of the Brahman
by word of command, or by force, paying nothing, then obey not the words
of your grandfather, but remain still in subjection <span
id="fr_330"></span>[2](#fn_327.md) to the Brahman." Such was his
instruction as he sent him away. And young *G*âli went accordingly, and
when asked by his grandfather, said:

As worth a thousand ounces, Sir,  
My father gave me to this man;  
As worth a hundred elephants,  
He gave the girl Ka*n*hâ*g*inâ."'

'Well has this puzzle, Nâgasena, been unravelled, well has the net of
heresy been torn to pieces, well has the argument of the adversaries
been overcome and your own doctrine been made evident, well has the
letter (of the Scriptures) been maintained while

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

you have thus explained its spirit! That is so, and I accept it as you
say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma as to Vessantara's gift of his wife and
children.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[DILEMMA THE SEVENTY-SECOND.  
PENANCE.\]

18\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, did all the Bodisats go through a period of
penance, or only Gotama?'

'Not all, O king, but Gotama did.'

'Venerable Nâgasena, if that be so, it is not right that there should be
a difference between Bodisat and Bodisat.'

\[**285**\] 'There are four matters, O king, in which there is such
difference. And what are the four? There is a difference as to the kind
of family (in which they are born <span
id="fr_331"></span>[1](#fn_328).md), there is a difference as to their
place in the period (which has elapsed since the succession of Buddhas
began <span id="fr_332"></span>[2](#fn_329).md), there

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

is a difference as to the length of their individual lives <span
id="fr_333"></span>[1](#fn_330.md), there is a difference as to their
individual size <span id="fr_334"></span>[2](#fn_331.md). In these four
respects, O king, there is a difference between Bodisat and Bodisat. But
there is no difference between any of the Buddhas, who are alike in
bodily beauty <span id="fr_335"></span>[3](#fn_332.md), in goodness of
character, in power of contemplation and of reasoning, in emancipation,
in the insight arising from the knowledge of emancipation, in

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

the four bases of confidence <span id="fr_336"></span>[1](#fn_333.md), in
the ten powers of a Tathâgata <span id="fr_337"></span>[2](#fn_334.md), in
the sixfold special

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

knowledge <span id="fr_338"></span>[1](#fn_335.md), in the fourteenfold
knowledge of Buddha <span id="fr_339"></span>[2](#fn_336.md), in the
eighteen characteristics of a Buddha <span
id="fr_340"></span>[3](#fn_337.md)--in a word, in all the qualities of a
Buddha. For all the Buddhas are exactly alike in all the
Buddha-qualities.'

'But if, Nâgasena, that be so, what is the reason that it was only the
Gotama Bodisat who carried out the penance?'

'Gotama the Bodisat had gone forth from the world, O king, when his
knowledge <span id="fr_341"></span>[4](#fn_338.md) was immature, and his
wisdom was immature. And it was when he was bringing that immature
knowledge to maturity that he carried out the penance.'

19\. 'Why then, Nâgasena, was it that he thus went forth with knowledge
and with wisdom immatured? Why did he not first mature his knowledge,
and then, with his knowledge matured, renounce the world?'

'When the Bodisat, O king, saw the women of his harem all in
disorder <span id="fr_342"></span>[5](#fn_339.md), then did he become
disgusted,

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

and in him thus disgusted discontent sprang up. And on perceiving that
his heart was filled with discontent, a certain god of those that wait
on Death (Mâra) thought: "This now is the time to dispel that discontent
of his heart," and standing in the air he gave utterance to these words:
"O honourable one! O fortunate one! Be not thou distressed. On the
seventh day from this the heavenly treasure of the Wheel shall appear to
thee, with its thousand spokes, its tire, and its nave, complete and
perfect; and the other treasures, those that walk on earth and those
that travel through the sky, shall come to thee of their own accord; and
the words of command of thy mouth shall bear sway over the four great
continents and the two thousand dependent isles; and thou shalt have
above a thousand sons, heroes mighty in strength to the crushing out of
the armies of the foe; and with those sons surrounding thee thou, master
of the Seven Treasures, shalt rule the world!" \[**286**\] But even as
if a bar of iron, heated the livelong day and glowing throughout, had
entered the orifice of his ear, so was it that those words, O king,
entered the ear of the Bodisat. And to the natural distress he already
felt there was added, by that utterance of the god, a further emotion,
anxiety, and fear. just as a mighty fiery furnace, were fresh fuel
thrown on it, would the more furiously burn--just as the broad earth, by
nature moist, and already swampy through the water dripping on it from
the vegetation and the grass that have arisen on it, would become more
muddy still when a great rain cloud had poured out rain upon it--so to
the distress that he already felt there was

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

added, by that utterance of the god, a further emotion, anxiety, and
fear.'

20\. 'But tell me, Nâgasena, if the heavenly Wheel-treasure had, on the
seventh day, appeared to the Bodisat, would he, the Wheel having
appeared, have been turned back from his purpose?'

'No Wheel-treasure appeared, O king, on the seventh day to the Bodisat.
For rather that was a lie that was told by that god with the object of
tempting him. And even had it appeared, yet would not the Bodisat have
turned aside. And why not? Because the Bodisat, O king, had firmly
grasped (the facts of) the impermanence (of all things, of) the
suffering (inherent in existence as an individual, of) the absence of a
soul (in any being made up of the five Skandhas), and had thus arrived
at the destruction of the attachment (to individuality which arises from
lust, or from heresy, or from dependence upon outward acts, or from
delusions as to the possession of a permanent soul) <span
id="fr_343"></span>[1](#fn_340.md). The water, O king, which flows into the
river Ganges from the Anottata lake, and from the Ganges river into the
great ocean, and from the great ocean into the openings into the

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

regions under the earth <span id="fr_344"></span>[1](#fn_341.md)--would
that water, after it had once entered that opening, turn back and flow
again into the great ocean, and from the great ocean into the Ganges
river, and from the Ganges river into the Anottata lake?'

\[**287**\] 'Certainly not, Sir.'

'In the same way, O king, it was for the sake of that last existence of
his that the Bodisat had matured merit through the immeasurable aeons of
the past. He had now reached that last birth, the knowledge of the
Buddhas had grown mature in him, in six years he would become a Buddha,
all-knowing, the highest being in the world. Would then the Bodisat, for
the sake of the Wheel-treasure, turn back?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'No! Though the great earth, O king, with all its peaks and mountain
ranges, should turn back, yet the Bodisat would not before he had
attained to Buddhahood. Though the water of the Ganges should flow
backwards up the stream, yet the Bodisat would not turn back before he
had attained to Buddhahood. Though the mighty ocean with its
immeasurable waters <span id="fr_345"></span>[2](#fn_342.md) should dry up
like the water in the footprint of a cow <span
id="fr_346"></span>[3](#fn_343.md), yet would not the Bodisat turn back
before he had attained to Buddhahood. Though Sineru, the king of the
mountains,

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

should split up into a hundred or a thousand fragments, yet would not
the Bodisat turn back before he had attained to Buddhahood. Though the
sun and moon with all the stars should fall, like a clod, upon the
ground, yet would not the Bodisat turn back before he had attained to
Buddhahood. Though the expanse of heaven should be rolled up like a mat,
yet would not the Bodisat turn back before he had attained to
Buddhahood! And why not? Because he had torn asunder every bond.'

21\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, how many bonds are there in the world?'

'There are these ten bonds in the world, O king, bound by which men
renounce not the world, or turn back again to it. And what are the ten?
A mother, O king, is often a bond, and a father, and a wife, and
children, and relations, and friends, and wealth, and easy income,
\[**288**\] and sovranty, and the five pleasures of sense. These are the
ten bonds common in the world, bonds bound by which men renounce not the
world or turn back to it. And all these bonds had the Bodisat, O king,
burst through. And therefore could he not, O king, turn back.'

22\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, if the Bodisat, on discontent arising in his
heart at the words of the god, though his knowledge (of the four Truths)
was yet imperfect, and his insight of a Buddha not mature, did
nevertheless go forth into renunciation of the world, of what advantage
was penance to him then? Ought he not rather, awaiting the maturity of
his knowledge, to have lived in the enjoyment of all (suitable) foods?'

'There are, O king, these ten sorts of individuals who are despised and
contemned in the world,

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

thought shameful, looked down upon, held blameworthy, treated with
contumely, not loved. And what are the ten? A woman without a husband, O
king, and a weak creature, and one without friends or relatives, and a
glutton, and one dwelling in a disreputable family, and the friend of
sinners, and he whose wealth has been dissipated, and he who has no
character, and he who has no occupation <span
id="fr_347"></span>[1](#fn_344.md), and he who has no means. These are the
ten despised and contemned in the world, thought shameful, looked down
upon, held blameworthy, treated with contumely, not loved <span
id="fr_348"></span>[2](#fn_345.md). It was on calling these conditions to
mind, O king, that this idea occurred to the Bodisat: "Let me not incur
blame among gods and men as being without occupation or without means!
Let me as a master in action, held in respect by reason of action, one
having the supremacy which arises from action, one whose conduct is
based upon action, one who carries action (into every concern of
life) <span id="fr_349"></span>[3](#fn_346.md), one who has his dwelling in
action, be constant in earnestness <span
id="fr_350"></span>[4](#fn_347.md)." That was the spirit, O king, in which
the Bodisat, when he was bringing his knowledge to maturity, undertook
the practice of penance.'

23\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, the Bodisat, when he was undergoing penance,
said thus to himself:

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

\[**289**\] "But it is not by this penance severe that I shall reach the
peculiar faculty of the insight arising from the knowledge of that which
is fit and noble--that insight beyond the powers of ordinary men, May
there not be now some other way to the wisdom (of Buddhahood) <span
id="fr_351"></span>[1](#fn_348.md)?"

'Was then the Bodisat, at that time, confused in his mind about the
way <span id="fr_352"></span>[2](#fn_349.md)?'

'There are twenty-five qualities, O king, which are causes of weakness
of mind, weakened by which the mind cannot successfully be devoted to
the destruction of the Âsavas (the Great Evils--lust, becoming,
delusion, and ignorance) <span id="fr_353"></span>[3](#fn_350.md). And what
are the twenty-five? Anger, O king, and enmity, and hypocrisy <span
id="fr_354"></span>[4](#fn_351.md), and conceit <span
id="fr_355"></span>[5](#fn_352.md), and envy, and avarice, and deceit <span
id="fr_356"></span>[6](#fn_353.md),

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

and treachery, and obstinacy <span id="fr_357"></span>[1](#fn_354.md), and
perverseness <span id="fr_358"></span>[2](#fn_355.md), and pride, and
vainglory, and the intoxication (of exalted ideas about birth or health
or wealth), and negligence in (well-doing), and intellectual inertness
or bodily sloth <span id="fr_359"></span>[3](#fn_356.md), and
drowsiness <span id="fr_360"></span>[4](#fn_357.md), and idleness, and
friendship with sinners, and forms, and sounds, and odours, and tastes,
and sensations of touch, and hunger, and thirst <span
id="fr_361"></span>[5](#fn_358.md), and discontent <span
id="fr_362"></span>[6](#fn_359.md). These are the

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

twenty-five qualities, O king, which are causes of weakness of mind,
weakened by which the mind cannot successfully be devoted to the
destruction of the Âsavas. (And of these it was) hunger and thirst, O
king, which had then seized hold of the body <span
id="fr_363"></span>[1](#fn_360.md) of the Bodisat. And his body being thus,
as it were, "possessed," his mind was not rightly devoted to the
destruction of the Âsavas. Now the Bodisat, O king, through the
immeasurable æons of the past, had followed after the perception of the
Four Noble Truths through all of his successive births. Is it then
possible that in his last existence, in the birth in which that
perception was to arise, there should be any confusion in his mind as to
the way? But nevertheless there arose, O king, in the Bodisat's mind the
thought: "May there not now be some other way to the wisdom (of a
Buddha)?" And already before that, O king, when he was only one month
old, when his father the Sakya was at work (ploughing), the Bodisat,
placed in his sacred cot for coolness under the shade of the *G*ambu
tree, sat up crosslegged, and putting away passion, free from all evil
conditions of heart, he entered into and remained in the first
*Gh*âna--a state of joy and ease, born of seclusion, full of reflection,
full of investigation, \[**290**\] and so into the second, and so into
the third, and so into the fourth *Gh*âna <span
id="fr_364"></span>[2](#fn_361.md).'

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say. It was
whilst he was bringing his knowledge to maturity that the Bodisat
underwent the penance.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma as to the penance undergone by the Bodisat.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[DILEMMA THE SEVENTY-THIRD.  
VIRTUE STRONGER THAN VICE.\]

24\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, which is the more powerful, virtue or vice?'

'Virtue, O king <span id="fr_365"></span>[1](#fn_362.md).'

'That is a saying, Nâgasena, which I cannot believe-that virtue is more
powerful than vice. For there are to be seen here (in the world) men who
destroy living creatures, who take to themselves what has not been
given, who walk in evil in their lusts, who speak lies, who commit gang
robberies on whole villages, who are highwaymen, sharpers, and
swindlers, and these all according to their crime suffer the cutting off
of their hands, or their feet, or their hands and feet, or their ears,
or

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

their nose, or their ears and nose, or the Gruel Pot, or the Chank
Crown, or the Râhu's Mouth, or the Fire Garland, or the Hand Torch, or
the Snake Strips, or the Bark Dress, or the Spotted Antelope, or the
Flesh Hooks, or the Penny Cuts, or the Brine Slits, or the Bar Turn, or
the Straw Seat, or they are anointed with boiling oil, or eaten by dogs,
or are impaled alive, or are beheaded with a sword <span
id="fr_366"></span>[1](#fn_363.md). Some of them sin one night and that
night experience the fruit of their sin, some sinning by night
experience the next day, some sinning one day experience that day, some
sinning by day experience that night, some experience when two days or
three have elapsed. But all experience in this present visible world the
result of their iniquity. And is there any one, Nâgasena, who from
having provided a meal with all its accessories <span
id="fr_367"></span>[2](#fn_364.md) for one, or two, or three, or four, or
five, or ten, or a hundred, or a thousand (members of the Order), has
enjoyed in this present visible world wealth or fame or happiness--(is
there any one who) from righteousness of life, or from observance of the
Uposatha, (has received bliss even in this life <span
id="fr_368"></span>[3](#fn_365).md)?'

25\. 'There are \[**291**\], O king, four men who by giving gifts, and
by the practice of uprightness, and by the keeping of Uposatha, even in
their earthly bodies attained to glory in Tidasapura (the city of the
gods).'

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

'And who, Sir, were they <span id="fr_369"></span>[1](#fn_366.md)?'

'Mandhâtâ the king, and Nimi the king, and Sâdhîna the king, and Guttila
the musician <span id="fr_370"></span>[2](#fn_367.md).'

'Venerable Nâgasena, this happened thousands of births ago, and is
beyond the ken of either of us two. Give me, if you can, some examples
from that period (of the world) which is now elapsing in which the
Blessed One has been alive.'

'In this present period, O king, the slave Pu*nn*aka, on giving a meal
to Sâriputta the Elder, attained that day to the dignity of a treasurer
(Se*tth*i), and he is now generally known as Pu*nn*aka the Se*tth*i. The
queen, the mother of Gopâla, who (being the daughter of poor peasant
folk) sold her hair for eight pennies, and therewith gave a meal to Mahâ
Ka*kk*âyana the Elder and his seven companions, became that very day the
chief queen of king Udena. Suppiyâ, the believing woman, cut flesh from
her own thigh to provide broth <span id="fr_371"></span>[3](#fn_368.md) for
a sick Bhikkhu, and on the very next day the wound closed up, and the
place became cured, with skin grown over it. Mallikâ, the queen who
(when a poor flower girl) gave the last night's gruel (she had reserved
for her own dinner) to the Blessed One, became that very day the chief
queen of the king of Kosala <span id="fr_372"></span>[4](#fn_369.md).
Sumana, the garland maker, when he had

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

presented to the Blessed One eight bunches of jessamine flowers, came
that very day into great prosperity. Eka-sâ*t*aka the Brahman, who gave
to the Blessed One his only garment, received that very day the office
of Sabba*tth*aka (Minister in general) <span
id="fr_373"></span>[1](#fn_370.md). All these, O king, came into the
enjoyment of wealth and glory in their then existing lives.'

'So then, Nâgasena, with all your searching and enquiry you have only
found six cases <span id="fr_374"></span>[2](#fn_371.md)?'

'That is so, O king.'

26\. 'Then it is vice, Nâgasena, and not virtue which is the more
powerful. For on one day alone I have seen ten men expiating their
crimes by being impaled alive, and thirty even, and forty, and fifty,
\[**292**\], and a hundred, and a thousand. And further, there was
Bhaddasâla, the soldier in the service of the royal family of
Nanda <span id="fr_375"></span>[3](#fn_372.md), and he waged war against
king *K*andagutta <span id="fr_376"></span>[4](#fn_373.md). Now in that
war, Nâgasena, there were eighty Corpse Dances. For they say that when
one great Head Holocaust has taken place (by which is meant the
slaughter of ten thousand elephants, and a lac of horses, and five
thousand charioteers, and a hundred ko*t*is of soldiers on foot), then
the headless corpses arise and dance in frenzy over the battle-field.
And all the men

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

thus slain came to destruction through the fruit of the Karma of their
evil deeds <span id="fr_377"></span>[1](#fn_374.md). And therefore, too, do
I say, Nâgasena, that vice is more powerful than virtue. And have you
heard, Nâgasena, that in all this dispensation (since the time of Gotama
the Buddha) the giving by the Kosala king has been unequalled?'

'Yes, I have heard so, O king.'

'But did he, Nâgasena, on account of his having given gifts so
unequalled, receive in this present life wealth, or glory, or
happiness?'

'No, O king, he did not.'

'Then, in that case, surely, Nâgasena, vice is more powerful than
virtue?'

27\. 'Vice, O king, by reason of its meanness, dies quickly away. But
virtue, by reason of its grandeur, takes a long time to die. And this
can be further examined into by a metaphor. just, O king, as in the West
Country <span id="fr_378"></span>[2](#fn_375.md) the kind of corn called
Kumuda-bha*nd*ikâ, ripening quickly and being garnered in a month, is
called Mâsalu (got in a month) <span id="fr_379"></span>[3](#fn_376.md),
but the rices only come to perfection in six months or five. What then
is the difference, what the distinction herein between Kumuda-bha*nd*ikâ
and rice?

'The one is a mean plant, O king, the other a grand one. The rices are
worthy of kings, meet for

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

the king's table; the other is the food of servants and of slaves.

\[**293**\] 'Just so, O king, it is by reason of its meanness that vice
dies quickly away. But virtue, by its grandeur, takes a long time to
die.'

28\. 'But, Nâgasena, it is just those things which come most quickly to
their end which are in the world considered the most powerful. And so
still vice must be the more powerful, not virtue. just, Nâgasena, as the
strong man who, when he enters into a terrible battle, is able the most
quickly to get hold of his enemies' heads under his armpit <span
id="fr_380"></span>[1](#fn_377.md), and dragging them along to bring them
prisoners to his lord, that is the champion who is regarded, in the
world, as the ablest hero--just as that surgeon who is able the most
quickly to extract the dart, and allay the disease, is considered the
most clever--just as the accountant who is able with the greatest speed
to make his calculations, and with most rapidity to show the result, is
considered the cleverest counter--just as the wrestler who is able the
most quickly to lift his opponent up, and make him fall flat on his
back, is considered the ablest hero--just so, Nâgasena, it is that one
of these two things--virtue and vice--which most quickly reaches its end
that is, in the world, the more powerful of the two.'

'The Karma of both the two, O king, will be made evident in future
births; but vice besides that will by reason of its guilt be made
evident at once, and in this present life. The rulers (Kshatriyas)

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

of old, O king, established this decree: "Whosoever takes life shall be
subject to a fine, and whosoever takes to himself what has not been
given, and whosoever commits adultery,, and whosoever speaks lies, and
whosoever is a dacoit, and whosoever is a highwayman, and whosoever
cheats and swindles. Such men shall be liable to be fined or beaten or
mutilated or broken <span id="fr_381"></span>[1](#fn_378.md) or executed."
And in pursuance thereof they held repeated enquiry, and then adjudged
one or other punishment accordingly. But, O king, has there ever been by
any one a decree promulgated: "Whosoever gives gifts, or observes a
virtuous life, or keeps Uposatha, to him shall wealth be given, or
honours?" And do they make continued enquiry, and bestow wealth or
honours accordingly, as they do stripes or bonds upon a thief?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'Well, if they did so then would virtue too be made evident even in this
life. \[**294**\] But as they neither make such enquiry concerning
givers, nor bestow wealth and honours upon them, therefore is virtue not
manifested now. And this is the reason, O king, why vice is made known
in this life, whereas he (the giver) receives the more abundantly in the
lives to come. And therefore it is virtue which, through the
destructions brought about by Karma, is by far the more powerful of the
two <span id="fr_382"></span>[2](#fn_379.md).'

'Very good, Nâgasena! Only by one wise as you could this puzzle have
been so well solved.

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

\[paragraph continues\] The problem put by me in worldly sense have you
in transcendental sense made clear.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma as to virtue and vice.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[DILEMMA THE SEVENTY-FOURTH.  
OFFERINGS TO THE DEAD.\]

29\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, these givers when they bestow their offerings,
devote them specifically to former (relatives) now departed <span
id="fr_383"></span>[1](#fn_380.md), saying: "May this gift benefit such and
such." Now do they (the dead) derive any benefit therefrom?'

'Some do, O king, and some do not.'

'Which then are they that do, and which do not?'

'Those who have been reborn in purgatory, O king, do not; nor those
reborn in heaven; nor those reborn as animals. And of those reborn as
Pretas three kinds do not-the Vantâsikâ (who feed on vomit), the
Khuppipâsino (who hunger and thirst.), the Ni*ggh*âma-ta*n*hikâ (who are
consumed by thirst). But the Paradattûpa*g*îvino (who live on the gifts
of others) they do derive profit, and those who bear them in remembrance
do so too.'

'Then, Nâgasena, offerings given by the givers have run to waste <span
id="fr_384"></span>[2](#fn_381.md), and are fruitless, since those

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

for whose benefit they are given derive no profit therefrom.'

'No, O king. They run not to waste, neither are fruitless. The givers
themselves derive profit from them.'

'Then convince me of this by a simile.'

'Suppose, O king, people were to get ready fish and meat and strong
drinks and rice and cakes, and make a visit on a family related to them.
If their relatives should not accept their complimentary present, would
that present be wasted or fruitless?'

No, Sir, it would go to the owners of it.'

'Well, just so the givers themselves derive the profit. Or just, O king,
\[**295**\] as if a man were to enter an inner chamber, and there were
no exit in front of him, how would he get out?'

'By the way he entered.'

'Well, just so the givers themselves derive the profit.'

30\. 'Let that pass, Nâgasena. That is so, and I accept it as you say.
We will not dispute your argument. But, venerable Nâgasena, if the
offerings made by such givers do advantage certain of the departed, and
they do reap the result of the gifts, then if a man who destroys living
creatures and drinks blood and is of cruel heart, were after committing
murder or any other dreadful act, to dedicate it to the departed,
saying: "May the result of this act of mine accrue to the
departed"--would it then be transferred to them?'

'No, O king.'

'But what is the reason, what is the cause, that a good deed can accrue
to them, and not an evil one?'

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

'This is really not a question you should ask, O king. Ask me no foolish
question, O king, in the idea that an answer will be forthcoming. You
will be asking me next why space is boundless, why the Ganges does not
flow up stream, why men and birds are bipeds, and the animals
quadrupeds!'

'It is not to annoy you that I ask this question, Nâgasena, but for the
sake of resolving a doubt. There are many people in the world who are
left-handed or squint <span id="fr_385"></span>[1](#fn_382.md). I put that
question to you, thinking: "Why should not also these unlucky ones have
a chance <span id="fr_386"></span>[2](#fn_383.md) of bettering
themselves?"'

'An evil deed, O king, cannot be shared with one who has not done it,
and has not consented to it. People convey water long distances by an
aqueduct. But could they in the same way remove a great mountain of
solid rock?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'Well, just in that way can a good deed be shared, but a bad one cannot.
And one can light a lamp with oil, but could one in the same way, O
king, light it with water?'

\[**296**\] 'Certainly not, Sir.'

'Well, so is it that a good deed can be shared, but not an evil one. And
husbandmen take water from a reservoir to bring their crops to maturity,
but could they for the same purpose, O king, take water from the sea?'

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'So again is it that though a good deed can be shared, an evil one
cannot.'

31\. 'But, venerable Nâgasena, why is that? Convince me of this by a
reason. I am not blind, or unobservant. I shall understand when I have
heard.'

'Vice, O king, is a mean thing, virtue is great and grand. By its
meanness vice affects <span id="fr_387"></span>[1](#fn_384.md) only the
doer, but virtue by its grandeur overspreads the whole world of gods and
men.'

'Show me this by a metaphor.'

'Were a tiny drop of water to fall on the ground, O king, would it flow
on over ten leagues or twelve?'

'Certainly not. It would only have effect <span
id="fr_388"></span>[2](#fn_385.md) on that very spot of ground on which it
fell.'

'But why so?'

'Because o its minuteness.'

'Just so, O king, is vice minute. And by reason of its littleness it
affects the doer only, and cannot possibly be shared. But if a mighty
rain cloud were to pour out rain satisfying the surface of the earth,
would that water spread round about?'

'Certainly, Sir. That thunderstorm would fill up the depressions in the
ground and the pools and ponds, and the gullies and crevices and chasms,
and the lakes and reservoirs and wells and lotus-tanks, and the water
would spread abroad for ten leagues or for twelve <span
id="fr_389"></span>[3](#fn_386.md).'

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

'But why so, O king?'

'Because of the greatness of the storm.'

'Just so, O king, is virtue great. And by reason of its abundance it can
be shared by gods and men.

'Venerable Nâgasena, why is it that vice is so limited, \[**297**\] and
virtue so much more wide-reaching?'

'Whosoever, O king, in this world gives gifts, and lives in
righteousness, and keeps Uposatha <span id="fr_390"></span>[1](#fn_387.md),
he, glad, right glad, joyful, cheerful, happy, becomes filled with a
sweet sense of trust and bliss, and bliss ruling in his heart his
goodness grows still more and more abundantly. Like a deep pool of clear
water, O king, and into which on one side the spring pours, while on the
other the water flows away; so as it flows away it comes again, and
there can be no failure there--so, O king, does his goodness grow more
and more abundantly. If even through a hundred years, O king, a man were
to keep on transferring <span id="fr_391"></span>[2](#fn_388.md) to others
(the merit of) any good he

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

had done, the more he gave it away the more would his goodness grow, and
he would still be able to share it with whomsoever he would. This, O
king, is the reason why virtue is so much the greater of the two.

32\. 'But on doing evil, O king, a man becomes filled with remorse <span
id="fr_392"></span>[1](#fn_389.md), and the heart of him who feels remorse
cannot get away (from the thought of the evil he has done), it is
forcibly bent back on it, thrown back on it, obtains no peace <span
id="fr_393"></span>[2](#fn_390.md); miserable, burning, abandoned of hope,
he wastes away, and gaining no relief from depression <span
id="fr_394"></span>[3](#fn_391.md), he is, as it were, possessed with his
woe! just, O king, as a drop of water, falling on a dry river bed with
its mighty sandbanks rising and falling in undulations along its crooked
and shifty course, gains not in volume, but is swallowed up on the very
spot where it fell, just so, O king, is a man, when he has done wrong,
overcome with remorse, and the heart of him who feels remorse cannot get
away from the thought of the evil he has done, it is forcibly bent back
on it, thrown back on it, obtains no peace; miserable, burning,
abandoned of hope, he wastes away, and gaining no release from his
depression, he is, as it

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

were, swallowed up of his woe. This is the reason, O king, why vice is
so mean.'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\[DILEMMA THE SEVENTY-FIFTH.  
DREAMS.\]

33\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, men and women in this world see dreams
pleasant and evil, things they have seen before and things they have
not, things they have done before and things they have not, \[**298**\]
dreams peaceful and terrible, dreams of matters near to them and distant
from them, full of many shapes and innumerable colours. What is this
that men call a dream, and who is it who dreams it?'

'It is a suggestion <span id="fr_395"></span>[1](#fn_392.md), O king,
coming across the path of the mind which is what is called a dream. And
there are six kinds of people who see dreams--the man who is of a windy
humour <span id="fr_396"></span>[2](#fn_393.md), or of a bilious one, or of
a phlegmatic one, the man who dreams dreams by the influence of a god,
the man who does so by the influence of his own habits, and the man who
does so in the way of prognostication <span
id="fr_397"></span>[3](#fn_394.md). And

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

of these, O king, only the last kind of dreams is true; all the rest are
false.'

34\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, when a man dreams a dream that is a
prognostication, how is it? Does his own mind set out itself to seek the
omen, or does the prognostication come of its own accord into the path
of his mind, or does some one else come and tell him of it?'

'His own mind does not itself seek the omen, neither does any one else
come and tell him of it. The prognostication comes of its own accord
into his mind. It is like the case of a looking-glass, which does not go
anywhere to seek for the reflection; neither does any one else come and
put the reflection on to the looking-glass. But the object reflected
comes from somewhere or other across the sphere over which the
reflecting power of the looking-glass extends.'

35\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, does the same mind which sees the dream also
know: "Such and such a result, auspicious or terrible, will follow?"'

'No, that is not so, O king. After the omen has occurred he tells
others, and then they explain the meaning of it.'

'Come, now, Nâgasena, give me a simile to explain this.'

'It is like the marks, O king, and pimples, and cutaneous eruptions
which arise on a man's body to his profit or loss, to his fame or
dishonour, to his praise or blame, to his happiness or woe. \[**299**\]
Do

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

in that case the pimples come because they know: "Such and such is the
event which we shall bring about?"'

'Certainly not, Sir. But according to the place on which the pimples
have arisen, the fortune-tellers, making their observations, give
decision, saying: Such and such will be the result."'

'Well, in the same way, O king, it is not the same mind which dreams the
dream which also knows: "Such and such a result, conspicuous or
terrible, will follow." But after the omen has occurred he tells others,
and they then explain the meaning of it.'

36\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, when a man dreams a dream, is he awake or
asleep?'

'Neither the one, O king; nor yet the other. But when his sleep has
become light <span id="fr_398"></span>[1](#fn_395.md), and he is not yet
fully conscious <span id="fr_399"></span>[2](#fn_396.md), in that interval
it is that dreams are dreamt. When a man is in deep sleep, O king, his
mind has returned home (has entered again into the
Bhava<u>n</u>ga) <span id="fr_400"></span>[3](#fn_397.md), and a mind thus
shut in does not act, and a mind hindered in its action knows not the
evil and the good, and he who knows not <span
id="fr_401"></span>[4](#fn_398.md) has no dreams. It is when the mind is
active that dreams are dreamt. just, O king, as in the darkness and
gloom, where no light is, no shadow will fall even on the most burnished
mirror, so when a man is in deep sleep his mind has returned into
itself, and

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

a mind shut in does not act, and a mind inactive knows not the evil and
the good, and he who knows not does not dream. For it is when the mind
is active that dreams are dreamt. As the mirror, O king, are you to
regard the body, as the darkness sleep, as the light the mind. Or again,
O king, just as the glory of a sun veiled in fog is imperceptible, as
its rays, though they do exist, are unable to pierce through, and as
when its rays act not there is no light, so when a man is in deep sleep
his mind has returned into itself, and a mind shut in does not act, and
a mind inactive knows not the evil and the good, and he who knows not
does not dream. For it is when the mind is active that dreams are
dreamt. As the sun, O king, are you to regard the body, as the veil of
fog sleep, \[**300**\] as the rays the mind.

37\. 'Under two conditions, O king, is the mind inactive though the body
is there--when a man being in deep sleep the mind has returned into
itself, and when the man has fallen into a trance <span
id="fr_402"></span>[1](#fn_399.md). The mind of a man who is awake, O king,
is excited, open, clear, untrammelled, and no prognostication occurs to
one whose mind is so. Just, O king, as men seeking concealment avoid the
man who is open, candid, unoccupied, and unreserved,--just so is it that
the divine intention is not manifested to the wakeful man, and the man
who is awake therefore sees no dream. Or again, O king, just as the
qualities which lead to wisdom are found not in that brother whose mode
of livelihood and conduct are wrong, who is the friend of sinners,
wicked, insolent, devoid

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

of zeal,--just so is it that the divine intention is not manifested to
the wakeful man, and the man who is awake, therefore, sees no dream.'

38\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, is there a beginning, a middle, and an end in
sleep?'

'Yes, O king, there is.'

'Which then is the beginning, which the middle, and which the end?'

'The feeling of oppression and inability <span
id="fr_403"></span>[1](#fn_400.md) in the body, O king, of weakness,
slackness, inertness--that is the beginning of sleep. The light
"monkey's sleep" in which a man still guards his scattered
thoughts <span id="fr_404"></span>[2](#fn_401.md)--that is the middle of
sleep. When the mind has entered into itself--that is the end of sleep.
And it is in the middle stage, O king, in the "monkey's sleep" that
dreams are dreamt. Just, O king, as when a man self-restrained with
collected thoughts, stedfast in the faith, unshaken in wisdom, plunges
deep into the woods far from the sound of strife, and thinks over some
subtle matter, he there, tranquil and at peace, will master the meaning
of it--just so a man still watchful, not fallen into sleep, but dozing
in a "monkey's sleep," will dream a dream. \[**301**\] As the sound of
strife, so, O king, are you to regard wakefulness, and as the lonely
wood the "monkey's sleep." And as that man avoiding the sound of strife,
keeping out of sleep, remaining in the middle stage, will master the
meaning of that subtle matter, so the still watchful man, not fallen
into sleep, but dozing in a "monkey's sleep," will dream a dream.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[DILEMMA THE SEVENTY-SIXTH.  
PREMATURE DEATH.\]

39\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, when beings die, do they all die in fullness
of time, or do some die out of due season?'

'There is such a thing, O king, as death at the due time, and such a
thing as premature death.'

'Then who are they whose decease is at the due time, and who are they
whose decease is premature?'

'Have you ever noticed, O king, in the case of mango trees or Gambu
trees or other fruit-bearing trees, that their fruits fall both when
they are ripe and when they are not ripe?'

'Yes, I have.'

'Well, those fallen fruits, do they all fall at the due time, or do some
fall prematurely?'

'Such of those fruits, Nâgasena, as are ripe and mature <span
id="fr_406"></span>[2](#fn_403.md) when they fall, fall in fullness of
time. But of the rest some fall because they are bored into by worms,
some because they are knocked down by a

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

long stick, some because they are blown down by the wind, some because
they have become rotten--and all these fall out of due season <span
id="fr_407"></span>[1](#fn_404.md).'

'Just so, O king, those men who die of the effect of old age, they die
in fullness of time. But of the rest some die of the dire effect of the
Karma (of evil deeds), some of excessive journeying <span
id="fr_408"></span>[2](#fn_405.md), some of excessive activity.'

40\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those who die of Karma, or of journeying, or
of activity, or of old age, they all die in fullness of time: and even
he who dies in the womb, that is his appointed time, so that he too dies
in fullness of time; and so of him who dies in the birth chamber
\[**302**\], or when he is a month old, or at any age up to a hundred
years. It is always his appointed time, and it is in the fullness of
time that he dies. So, Nâgasena, there is no such thing as death out of
due season. For all who die, die at the appointed time.'

'There are seven kinds of persons, O king, who, there being still a
portion of their appointed age to run, die out of time. And which are
the seven? The starving man, O king, who can get no food, whose inwards
are consumed <span id="fr_409"></span>[3](#fn_406.md)--and the thirsty man
who can get no water, whose heart is dried up--and the man bitten by a
snake, who, when consumed by the fierce energy of poison, can find no
cure and he who has taken poison, and when all his limbs are

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

burning, is unable to procure medicine--and one fallen into fire, who
when he is aflame, can find no means of putting out the fire--and he who
having fallen into water can find no firm ground to stand on--and the
man wounded by a dart, who in his illness can find no surgeon--all these
seven, there being still a portion of their appointed time to run, die
out of due season. And herein (in all these seven cases) I declare that
they are all of one nature <span id="fr_410"></span>[1](#fn_407.md). In
eight ways, O king, does the death of mortals take place--through excess
of windy humour, or of bilious humour, or of phlegmatic humour, through
the adverse union of these three, through variations in temperature,
through inequality in protection, through (medical) treatment, and
through the working of Karma <span id="fr_411"></span>[2](#fn_408.md). And
of these, O king, it is only death by the working of Karma that is death
at the due season, all the rest are cases of death out of due season.
For it is said:

"By hunger, thirst, by poison, and by bites,  
Burnt, drowned, or slain, men out of time do die;  
By the three humours, and by three combined,  
By heats, by inequalities, by aids,  
By all these seven men die out of time <span
id="fr_412"></span>[3](#fn_409.md)."

41\. \[**303**\] 'But there are some men, O king, who die through the
working of some evil deed or other they have committed in a former
birth. And of

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

these, O king, whosoever has starved others to death, after having been
himself through many hundreds of thousands of years tormented by hunger,
famished, exhausted, emaciated, and withered of heart, dried up, wasted
away, heated, and all on fire within, will, either as youth or man or
old man, die of hunger too. And that death will be to him a death at the
appointed time <span id="fr_413"></span>[1](#fn_410.md). Whosoever has put
others to death by thirst, after having through many hundreds of
thousands of years become a Preta consumed by thirst, thin and
miserable, will himself too, either as youth or man or old man, die of
thirst. And that death will be to him a death at the appointed time.
Whosoever has put others to death by having them bitten by snakes, will,
after wandering through many hundreds of thousands of years from
existence to existence, in which he is constantly bitten by boa
constrictors and black snakes, himself too, either as youth or man or
old man, die of snake bite. And that will be to him a death at the
appointed time. Whosoever has put others to death by poison will, after
existing for many hundreds of thousands of years with burning limbs and
broken body, and exhaling the odour of a corpse, himself too, either as
youth or man or old man, die of poison. And that will be to him a death
at the appointed time. Whosoever has put others to death by fire, he
having wandered from purgatory <span id="fr_414"></span>[2](#fn_411.md) to
purgatory, from one mass of burning charcoal to

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

another, with burning and tortured limbs, for many hundreds of thousands
of years, will himself too, either as youth or man or old man, be burnt
to death. And that will be to him a death at the appointed time.
Whosoever has put others to death by drowning, he having suffered many
hundreds of thousands of years as a being disabled, ruined, broken, weak
in limb, and anxious in heart, will himself too, either as youth or man
or old man, die by drowning. And that will be to him a death at the
appointed time. Whosoever has put others to death by the sword,
\[**304**\] he having suffered for many hundreds of thousands of years
(in repeated births as an animal) from cuts and wounds and blows and
bruises, or (when born as a man) ever destroyed by weapons <span
id="fr_415"></span>[1](#fn_412.md), will himself too, either as youth or
man or old man, perish by the sword. And that will be to him a death at
the appointed time.'

42\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, the death out of due time that you also speak
of--come now, tell me the reason for that.'

'As a great and mighty fire, O king, on to which dry grass and sticks
and branches and leaves have been heaped, will nevertheless, when this
its food has been consumed, die out by the exhaustion of the fuel. Yet
such a fire is said to have gone out in fullness of time, without any
calamity or accident (having happened to it). Just so, O king, the man
who, when he has lived many thousands of days, when he is old and
stricken in years, dies at last of

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

old age, without any calamity or accident having happened to him, is
said to have reached death in the fullness of time. But if there were a
great and mighty fire, O king, on to which dry grass and sticks and
branches and leaves had been heaped, then if a mighty rain cloud were to
pour out rain upon it, and it were thus to be put out, even before the
fuel was consumed, could it be said, O king, that that great fire had
gone out in fullness of time?'

'No, Sir, it could not.'

'But wherein would the second fire differ, in its nature, from the
first?'

'The second one, Sir, which suffered from the onset of the rain--that
fire would have gone out before its time.'

'Just so, O king, whosoever dies before his time does so in consequence
of suffering from the attack of some disease,--from excess of windy
humour, or of bilious humour, or of phlegmatic humour, or from the union
of the three, or from variations in temperature, or from inequality in
protection, or from treatment, or from hunger, or from thirst, or from
fire, or from water, or from the sword. This, O king, is the reason why
there is such a thing as dying before one's time.

43\. 'Or again, O king, it is like a mighty storm cloud which, rising up
into the heavens, should pour out rain, filling the valleys and the
plains. That cloud would be said to have rained without calamity or
accident. Just so, O king, the man who after having lived long, dies at
last, when he is old and well stricken in years, without any calamity or
accident having happened to him, of old age, is said to have

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

reached death in the fullness of time. \[**305**\] But if, O king, a
mighty storm cloud were to rise up into the heavens, and as it did so
were to be dissipated by a mighty wind, could it be said, O king, that
that cloud had perished in due time?'

'No, Sir, it could not.'

'But wherein would the second cloud differ, in its nature, from the
first?'

'The second one, Sir, which suffered from the onset of the whirlwind,
would have been dissipated before its time.'

'Just so, O king, whosoever dies before his time does so in consequence
of suffering from the attack of some disease,--from excess of windy
humour, or of bilious humour, or of phlegmatic humour, or from the union
of the three, or from variations in temperature, or from inequality in
protection, or from treatment, or from hunger, or from thirst, or from
fire, or from water, or from the sword. This, O king, is the reason why
there is such a thing as dying before one's time.

44\. 'Or again, O king, it is like a powerful and deadly snake, which
being angered should bite a man, and to him that poison, no impediment
and no accident happening to it, should bring death. That poison would
be said, without impediment or accident, to have reached its aim. Just
so, O king, the man who, having lived long, dies at last, when he is old
and well stricken in years, without any calamity or accident having
happened to him, of old age, he is said to have reached, unimpeded and
uninterrupted, to the goal of his life, to have died in the fullness of
time. But if a snake charmer were to give a drug to the man while he was
suffering from

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

the bite, and thus get rid of the poison, could it be said that the
poison was removed in the fullness of time?'

'No, Sir, it could not.'

'But wherein, O king, would the second poison differ, in its nature,
from the first?'

'The second one, Sir, which was acted upon by the introduction of the
drug, would have been removed before its end was attained.'

'Just so, O king, whosoever dies before his time does so in consequence
of suffering from the attack of some disease,--from excess of windy
humour, or of bilious humour, or of phlegmatic humour, or from the union
of the three, or from variations in temperature, or from inequality in
protection, or from treatment, or from hunger, or from thirst, or from
fire, or from water, or from the sword. This, O king, is the reason why
there is such a thing as dying before one's time.

45\. 'Or again, O king, it is like the arrow discharged by an archer.
\[**306**\] If that arrow should go to the very end of the line of the
path along which it was natural for it to go, then it would be said to
have reached that aim, without let or hindrance. Just so, O king, the
man who, having lived long, dies at last, when he is old and well
stricken in years, without any calamity or accident having happened to
him, of old age, is said to have reached death, unimpeded and
uninterrupted, in the fullness of time. But if, at the moment when the
archer was discharging the arrow, some one should catch hold of it,
could that arrow be said to have reached the end of the line of the path
along which it was shot?'

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

'No, Sir, it could not.'

'But wherein, O king, would the second arrow differ, in its nature, from
the first?'

'By the seizure which intervened, Sir, the course of the second arrow
was arrested.'

'Just so, O king, whosoever dies before his time does so in consequence
of suffering from the attack of some disease,--from excess of windy
humour, or of bilious humour, or of phlegmatic humour, or from the union

protection, or from treatment, or from hunger, or from thirst, or from
fire, or from water, or from the sword. This, O king, is the reason why
there is such a thing as dying before one's time.

46\. 'Or again, O king, it is like the brazen vessel which a man should
strike. And by his striking thereof a note should be produced, and sound
to the very end of the line of the path along which it was its nature to
sound. It would then be said to have reached that aim without let or
hindrance. Just so, O king, the man who, having lived long, dies at
last, when he is old and well stricken in years, without any calamity or
accident having happened to him, of old age, is said to have reached
death, without let or hindrance, in the fullness of time. But if a man
were to strike a brazen vessel, and by his striking thereof a note
should be produced, but some one, before it had reached any distance,
were to touch the vessel, and at his touching thereof the sound should
cease, could then that sound be said to have reached the end of the line
of the path along which it was its nature to sound

'No, Sir, it could not.'

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

'But wherein, O king, would the second sound differ, in its nature, from

well in the field, and by means of a plentiful downpour of rain had
become well laden far and wide <span id="fr_417"></span>[2](#fn_414.md)

But if that corn, after it had sprung up well in the field, should,
deprived of water, die, could it be said to have reached its due
season?'

had come to ear, worms sprung up and destroyed down to the roots?'

'We have both heard of such a thing, Sir, and have seen it, too.'

'Well, O king, was that crop destroyed in season, or out of season?'

'Out of season, Sir. For surely if worms had not destroyed the crop it
would have survived to harvest time.'

'What then, O king! on a disaster intervening the crop is lost, but if
no injury is done it, it survives to the harvest?'

'That is so, Sir.'

rain (hail-storm) <span id="fr_419"></span>[2](#fn_416.md) falling on it,
destroyed it?'

'We have both heard of such a thing, Sir, and have seen it, too.'

'Well, O king! would you say the crop was destroyed in season or out of

explained, by reason and by simile, how it is that people die before

'Of some, O king, but not of others.'

'But of which, Sir, is this the case, and of which not?'

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

'It is by the stedfast resolve, O king, of three kinds of people, that
wonders take place at the *K*etiya of some person deceased who has been
entirely set free. And who are the three? In the first place, O king, an
Arahat, when still alive, may, out of pity for gods and men, make the
resolve: "Let there be such and such wonders at my *K*etiya <span
id="fr_422"></span>[1](#fn_419.md)." Then, by reason of his resolve,
wonders happen there. Thus is it that wonders occur by the resolve of an
Arahat at the *K*etiya of one entirely set free.

'And again, O king, the gods, out of pity for men, show wonders at the
*K*etiya of one who has been entirely set free, thinking: "By this
wonder may the true faith remain always established on the earth, and
may mankind, believing, grow in grace!" Thus is it that wonders occur by
the resolve of a god at the Ketiya of one entirely set free.

'And again, O king, some woman or some man of believing heart, able,
intelligent, wise, endowed with insight, may deliberately take perfumes,
or a garland, or a cloth, and place it on the Ketiya, making the
resolve: "May such and such a wonder take place!" Thus is it that
wonders occur by the resolve of human beings at the *K*etiya of one
entirely set free.

52\. 'These, O king, are the three kinds of people by whose stedfast
resolve wonders take place at the *K*etiyas of Arahats deceased. And if
there has been no such resolve, O king, by one of these, then

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

is there no wonder at the *K*etiya even of one whose Âsavas had been
destroyed, who had attained to the sixfold insight, who was master of
himself. And if there be no such wonder, then, O king, \[**310**\] one
should call to mind the purity of conduct one has seen <span
id="fr_423"></span>[1](#fn_420.md), and draw in trusting faith the
conclusion: "Verily, this child of the Buddhas has been entirely set
free!"'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\[DILEMMA THE SEVENTY-EIGHTH.  
CONVERSION AND CONDUCT.\]

53\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those who regulate their lives aright--do they
all attain to insight into the Truth, or are there some of them who do
not?'

'Some do, O king, and some do not.'

'Then which do, Sir, and which do not?'

'He who is born as an animal, O king, even though he regulate his life
aright, will not attain to insight into the Truth, nor he who is born in

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

the Preta world, nor he who holds wrong views, nor the deceitful man,
nor he who has slain his mother, or his father, or an Arahat, nor he who
has raised up a schism in the Order, nor he who has shed a Buddha's
blood, nor he who has furtively attached himself to the Order <span
id="fr_424"></span>[1](#fn_421.md), nor he who has become a pervert <span
id="fr_425"></span>[2](#fn_422.md), nor he who has violated a sister of the
Order, nor he who, having been guilty of one or other of the thirteen
grievous offences <span id="fr_426"></span>[3](#fn_423.md), has not been
rehabilitated, nor a eunuch, nor an hermaphrodite--and whosoever is a
human child under seven years of age, even though he regulate his life
aright, will not attain to insight into the Truth. To these sixteen
individuals there is no attainment of insight, O king, even though they
regulate their life aright.'

54\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, there may or may not be a possibility of
insight to the fifteen you have first singled out for opposition <span
id="fr_427"></span>[4](#fn_424.md). But what is the reason why an infant,
one under seven years of age, should not, even though he regulate his
life aright, attain to insight? Therein there is still a puzzle left.
For is it not admitted that in a child there is not passion, neither
malice, nor dullness, nor pride, nor heresy, nor discontent, nor lustful
thoughts? Being undefiled by sin, that which we call an infant is fit
and ready (to the attainment

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

even of Arahatship--how much more) <span id="fr_428"></span>[1](#fn_425.md)
is he worthy to penetrate at a glance into the four truths!'

'The following is the reason, O king, for my saying \[**311**\] that an
infant, even though he regulate his life aright, cannot attain to
insight. If, O king, one under seven years of age could feel passion
about things exciting to passion, could go wrong in things leading to
iniquity, could be befooled in matters that mislead, could be maddened
as to things that infatuate, could understand a heresy, could
distinguish between content and discontent, could think out virtue and
vice, then might insight be possible to him. But the mind of one under
seven years of age, O king, is powerless and weak, mean, small, slight,
obscure, and dull, whereas the essential principle of Nirvâ*n*a is
transcendental, important, weighty, wide-reaching, and extensive.
Therefore is it, O king, that the infant, with so imperfect a mind, is
unable to grasp an idea so great. It is like the case of Sineru, O king,
the king of the mountains, heavy and ponderous, wide-reaching and mighty
as it is,--could now a man, by his ordinary strength and power and
energy, root that mountain up <span id="fr_429"></span>[2](#fn_426.md)?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'But why not?'

'Because of the weakness of the man, and because of the mightiness of
Sineru, the mountain king.'

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

'Just so, O king, is the relation of the infant's mind to
Nirvâ*n*a <span id="fr_430"></span>[1](#fn_427.md).'

55\. 'And again, it is like the broad earth, O king, long and wide,
great in expanse and extension, large and mighty--would now a tiny drop
of water be able to wet and turn to mud that broad earth <span
id="fr_431"></span>[2](#fn_428.md)?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'But why not, O king?'

'Because of the minuteness of the drop of water, and because of the
greatness of the broad earth.'

'Just so, O king, is the relation of the infant's mind to Nirvâ*n*a.

\[**312**\] 56. 'Or again, O king, suppose there were weak and
powerless, minute, tiny, limited, and dull fire--would it be possible,
with so insignificant a fire, to overcome darkness and make light appear
over the whole world of gods and men?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'But why not, O king?'

'Because of the dullness of the fire, and because of the greatness of
the world.'

'Just so, O king, the mind of one under seven years of age is powerless
and weak, limited, insignificant, obscure, and dull; it is veiled,
moreover, with the thick darkness of ignorance. Hard would it be,
therefore, for it to shine forth with the light of knowledge. And that
is the reason, O king, why to an infant, to one under seven years of
age, even though he order his conduct aright, there can be no attainment
of insight into the Truth.

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

57\. 'Or again, O king, suppose there were a Sâlaka <span
id="fr_432"></span>[1](#fn_429.md), minute in the measure of its body, and
rendered lean by disease, and it on seeing an elephant king, which
showed the signs of rut in three places, and was nine cubits in length,
and three in breadth, and ten in girth, and seven in height <span
id="fr_433"></span>[2](#fn_430.md), coming to its lair, were to begin to
drag the elephant towards it with the view of swallowing it--now would
the Sâlaka, O king, be able to do <span
id="fr_434"></span>[3](#fn_431.md)?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'But why not, O king?'

'Because of the minuteness of the Sâlaka's body, and because of the
magnitude of the elephant king.'

'Just so, O king, the mind of one under seven years of age is powerless
and weak, limited, insignificant, obscure, and dull. Grand and
transcendental is the ambrosial essence of Nirvâ*n*a <span
id="fr_435"></span>[4](#fn_432.md). With that mind so powerless and weak,
so limited, insignificant, obscure, and dull, he cannot penetrate into
the grand and transcendental essence of Nirvâ*n*a.

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

And that is the reason, O king, why to an infant, one under seven years
of age, even though he order his conduct aright, there can be no
attainment to insight of the Truth.'

\[DILEMMA THE SEVENTY-NINTH.  
THE PAIN OF NIRVÂ*N*A <span id="fr_436"></span>[1](#fn_433.md).\]

\[**313**\] 58. 'Venerable Nâgasena, how is it? Is Nirvâ*n*a all bliss,
or is it partly pain. <span id="fr_437"></span>[2](#fn_434.md)?

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

'Nirvâ*n*a is all bliss, O king. There is no intermingling of pain in
it.'

'That, Sir, is a saying we cannot believe--that Nirvâ*n*a is all bliss.
On this point, Nâgasena, we maintain that Nirvâ*n*a must be alloyed with
pain. And there is a reason for our adopting that view. What is that
reason? Those, Nâgasena, who seek after Nirvâ*n*a are seen to practise
exertion and application both of body and of mind, restraint in
standing, walking, sitting, lying, and eating, suppression of sleep,
subjugation of the organs of sense, renunciation of wealth and corn, of
dear relatives and friends. But all those who are joyful and happy in
the world take delight in, are devoted to, the five pleasures of
sense--they practise and delight their eyes in many kinds of pleasurable
forms, such as at any time they like the best--they practise and delight
their ears in many kinds of pleasurable sounds of revelry and song, such
as at any time they like the best--they practise and delight their sense
of smell with many kinds of perfumes of flowers, and fruits, and leaves,
and bark, and roots, and sap, such as at any time they like the
best--they practise and delight their tongue with many kinds of
pleasurable tastes of hard foods and of soft, of syrups, drinks, and
beverages, such as at any time they like the best--they practise and
delight their sense of touch with many kinds of pleasurable feelings,
tender and delicate, exquisite and soft, such as at any time they like
the best--they practise and delight their minds with many sorts of
conceptions and ideas, pure and impure, good and bad, such as at any
time they like the best. You, on the other hand, put a stop to and
destroy,

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

maim and mangle, put a drag on and restrain the development of your eye,
and ear, and nose, and tongue, and body, and mind. Therefore is your
body afflicted and your mind afflicted too, and your body being
afflicted you feel bodily discomfort and pain, and your minds being
afflicted you feel mental discomfort too and pain. Did not even
Mâgandiya, the ascetic, find fault with the Blessed One, and say <span
id="fr_438"></span>[1](#fn_435.md): \[**314**\] "The Sama*n*a Gotama is a
destroyer of increase <span id="fr_439"></span>[2](#fn_436.md)?"'

59\. 'Nirvâ*n*a, O king, has no pain in it. It is bliss unalloyed. When
you, O king, maintain that Nirvâ*n*a is painful, that which you call
"painful" is not Nirvâ*n*a. It is the preliminary stage to the
realisation of Nirvâ*n*a, it is the process of seeking after Nirvâ*n*a.
Nirvâ*n*a itself is bliss pure and simple, there is no pain mixed with
it. And I will give you an explanation of this. Is there such a thing, O
king, as the bliss of sovranty which kings enjoy?'

'Most certainly.'

'And is there no pain, O king, mingled with that bliss?'

'No, Sir.'

'But surely then, O king, why is it that when their frontier provinces
have broken out in revolt, the kings, to the end that they may bring the
inhabitants of those provinces into subjection again, leave their homes,
attended by their ministers and chiefs, their

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

soldiers and their guards, and marching over ground even and uneven,
tormented the while by gnats and mosquitoes and hot winds, engage in
fierce fights, and suffer the presentiment of death?'

'That, venerable Nâgasena, is not what is called the bliss of sovranty.
It is only the preliminary stage in the pursuit of that bliss. It is
after they have thus, in pain, sought after sovranty, that they enjoy
the bliss thereof. And thus that bliss, Nâgasena, is itself unmixed with
pain, for the bliss of sovranty is one thing, and the pain another.'

'Just so, O king, is Nirvâ*n*a all bliss, and there is no pain mingled
with it. Those who are in quest of Nirvâ*n*a afflict their minds and
bodies it is true, restrain themselves in standing, walking, sitting,
lying, and in food, suppress their sleep, keep their senses in
subjection, abandon their very body and their life. But it is after they
have thus, in pain, sought after Nirvâ*n*a, that they enjoy the
Nirvâ*n*a which is bliss unalloyed--as kings do the bliss of sovranty
after their foes have been put down. Thus is it, O king, that Nirvâ*n*a
is all bliss, and there is no pain mingled with it. For Nirvâ*n*a is one
thing, and the pain another.

\[**315**\] 60. 'And hear another explanation, O king, of the same
thing. Is there such a thing, O king, as the bliss of knowledge which
those teachers have who have passed through their course?'

'Yes, Sir, there is.'

'Well, is that bliss of knowledge alloyed with pain?'

'No.'

'What then, O king, is the good of their afflicting

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

themselves by bowing down before and standing up in the presence of
their teachers; by drawing water, and sweeping out the cell, and placing
tooth-sticks and washing-water ready; by living upon scraps left over;
by doing service in shampooing, and bathing, and washing of the feet; by
suppressing their own will, and acting according to the will of others;
by sleeping in discomfort, and feeding on distasteful food?'

'That, Nâgasena, is not the bliss of knowledge, it is a preliminary
stage in the pursuit thereof. It is after the teachers have, in pain,
sought after knowledge, that they enjoy its bliss. Thus is it, Nâgasena,
that the bliss of knowledge is unalloyed with pain. For that bliss of
knowledge is one thing, and the pain another.'

'Just so, O king, is Nirvâ*n*a all bliss, and there is no pain mingled
with it. Those who are in quest of Nirvâ*n*a afflict their minds and
bodies it is true, restrain themselves in standing, walking, sitting,
lying, and in food, suppress their sleep, keep their senses in
subjection, abandon their very body and their life. But it is after they
have thus, in pain, sought after Nirvâ*n*a, that they enjoy the
Nirvâ*n*a which is bliss unalloyed--as teachers do the bliss of
knowledge. Thus is it, O king, that Nirvâ*n*a is all bliss, and there is
no pain mingled with it. For Nirvâ*n*a is one thing, and the pain
another.'

\[DILEMMA THE EIGHTIETH.  
THE OUTWARD FORM OF NIRVÂ*N*A.\]

61\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, this Nirvâ*n*a that you are always talking
of--can you make clear by metaphor, or explanation, or reason, or
argument, the form, or figure, or duration <span
id="fr_440"></span>[1](#fn_437.md), or measure of it?'

\[**316**\] 'Nirvâ*n*a, O king, has nothing similar to it. By no
metaphor, or explanation, or reason, or argument can its form, or
figure, or duration, or measure be made clear.'

'That I cannot believe, Nâgasena,--that of Nirvâ*n*a, which really after
all is a condition that exists <span id="fr_441"></span>[2](#fn_438.md), it
should be so impossible in any way to make us understand either the
form, or figure, or duration, or measure! Give me some explanation of
this.'

62\. 'Very well, O king, I will do so. Is there such a thing, O king, as
the great ocean?'

'Yes, the ocean exists.'

'Well, suppose some one were to ask you, saying: "How much water is
there, your majesty, in the sea, and how many are the creatures that
dwell therein?" When that question had been put, how would you answer
him?'

'I should reply thus to such a question: "My good fellow! this is an
unaskable thing that you ask me. No one ought to ask such a question. It

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

is a point that should be left alone. The physicists <span
id="fr_442"></span>[1](#fn_439.md) have never examined into the ocean in
that way. And no one can measure the water there, or count the creatures
who dwell therein." Thus, Sir, should I make reply.'

63\. 'But why, O king, would you make such a reply about the ocean
which, after all, is really an existing condition of things <span
id="fr_443"></span>[2](#fn_440.md). Ought you not rather to count and tell
him, saying: "So and so much is the water in the sea, and so and so many
are the creatures that dwell therein?"'

'That would be impossible, Sir. The question is beyond one's power.'

'As impossible as it is, O king, to tell the measure of the water in the
sea, or the number of the creatures dwelling therein, though after all
the sea exists, so impossible is it in any of the ways you suggest to
tell the form, or figure, or duration, or measure of Nirvâ*n*a, though
after all it is a condition that does exist. \[**317**\] And even, O
king, if one of magical powers, master over mind, were to be able to
count the water and the creatures in the sea, even he could not tell the
form or the figure, the duration or the measure of Nirvâ*n*a.

64\. 'And hear another explanation of the same thing, O king. Are there,
O king, among the gods certain of them called "The Formless Ones <span
id="fr_444"></span>[3](#fn_441.md)?

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

'Yes, Sir. I have heard there are such.'

'Well, O king, can you make clear by metaphor, or explanation, or
reason, or argument the form, or figure, or duration <span
id="fr_445"></span>[1](#fn_442.md), or size of these gods, the "Formless
Ones?"'

'No, I cannot.'

'Then, O king, there are none.'

'The Formless Ones, Sir, do exist; and yet it is impossible in any of
the ways you suggest to explain either their form or figure, either
their duration or their size.'

'As impossible as it is, O king, to tell the form or figure, the
duration or the size of the gods called "Formless Ones," though they
after all are beings that exist <span id="fr_446"></span>[2](#fn_443.md),
so impossible is it in any of the ways you suggest to explain the form
or the figure, the duration or the measure of Nirvâ*n*a, though after
all it is a condition that does exist.'

65\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, I will grant you that Nirvâ*n*a is bliss
unalloyed, and yet that is impossible to make clear, either by simile or
explanation, by reason or by argument, either its form or its figure,
either its duration or its size. But is there no quality of Nirvâ*n*a
which is inherent also in other

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

things <span id="fr_447"></span>[1](#fn_444.md), and is such that it can be
made evident by metaphor <span id="fr_448"></span>[2](#fn_445.md)?'

'Though there is nothing as to its form which can be so explained, there
is something, O king, as to its qualities which can.'

\[**318**\] 'O happy word, Nâgasena! Speak then, quickly, that I may
have an explanation of even one point in the characteristics of
Nirvâ*n*a. Appease the fever of my heart. Allay it by the cool sweet
breezes of your words!'

'There is one quality of the lotus, O king, inherent in Nirvâ*n*a, and
two qualities of water, and three of medicine, and four of the ocean,
and five of food, and ten of space, and three of the wish-conferring
gem, and three of red sandal wood, and three of the froth of ghee, and
five of a mountain peak.'

66\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the lotus which you said
was inherent in Nirvâ*n*a,--which is that?'

'As the lotus, O king, is untarnished by the water <span

67\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those two qualities of water which you said

'As water, O king, is cool and assuages heat, so also is Nirvâ*n*a cool,
and assuages the fever arising from all evil dispositions. This is the
first quality of water inherent in Nirvâ*n*a. And again, O king, as
water allays the thirst of men and beasts when they are exhausted and
anxious, craving for drink, and tormented by thirst, so does Nirvâ*n*a
allay the thirst of the craving after lusts, the craving after future
life, and the craving after worldly prosperity <span

poison, so is Nirvâ*n*a the refuge of beings tormented with the poison
of evil dispositions. This is the first quality of medicine inherent in

does Nirvâ*n*a put an end to griefs. This is the second quality of
medicine inherent in Nirvâ*n*a. And again, O king, as medicine is
ambrosia <span id="fr_451"></span>[2](#fn_448.md), so also is Nirvâ*n*a
ambrosia. This is the third quality of medicine inherent in Nirvâ*n*a.'

said were inherent in Nirvâ*n*a,--which are they?'

'As the ocean, O king, is free from (empty of) corpses <span

of) the dead bodies of all evil dispositions <span
id="fr_453"></span>[2](#fn_450.md). This, O king, is the first quality of
the ocean inherent in Nirvâ*n*a. And again, O king, as the ocean is
mighty and boundless, and fills not with all the rivers that flow in to
it; so is Nirvâ*n*a mighty and boundless, and fills not with all beings
(who enter in to it). This is the second quality of the ocean inherent
in Nirvâ*n*a. And again, O king, as the ocean is the abode of mighty
creatures, so is Nirvâ*n*a the abode of great men--Arahats, in whom the
Great Evils and all stains have been destroyed, endowed with power,
masters of themselves. This is the third quality of the ocean inherent
in Nirvâ*n*a. And again, O king, as the ocean is all in blossom <span
id="fr_454"></span>[3](#fn_451.md), as it were, with the innumerable and
various and fine flowers of the ripple of its waves, so is Nirvâ*n*a all

various and fine flowers of purity, of knowledge, and of emancipation.
This is the fourth quality of the ocean inherent in Nirvâ*n*a.'

\[**320**\] 70. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those five qualities of food which
you said were inherent in Nirvâ*n*a,--which are they?'

'As food, O king, is the support of the life of all beings, so is
Nirvâ*n*a, when it has been realised, the support of life, for it puts
an end to old age and death. This is the first quality of food inherent
in Nirvâ*n*a. And again, O king, as food increases the strength of all
beings, so does Nirvâ*n*a, when it has been realised, increase the power
of Iddhi of all beings. This is the second quality of food inherent in
Nirvâ*n*a. And again, O king, as food is the source of the beauty of all
beings, so is Nirvâ*n*a, when it has been realised, the source to all
beings of the beauty of holiness. This is the third quality of food
inherent in Nirvâ*n*a. And again, O king, as food puts a stop to
suffering in all beings, so does Nirvâ*n*a, when it has been realised,
put a stop in all beings to the suffering arising from every evil
disposition. This is the fourth quality of food inherent in Nirvâ*n*a.
And again, O king, as food overcomes in all beings the weakness of
hunger, so does Nirvâ*n*a, when it has been realised, overcome in all
beings the weakness which arises from hunger and every sort of pain.
This is the fifth quality of food inherent in Nirvâ*n*a.'

71\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those ten qualities of space which you said
were inherent in Nirvâ*n*a,--which are they?'

'As space, O king, neither is born nor grows old, neither dies nor
passes away nor is reborn (has

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

a future life to spring up into), as it is incompressible, cannot be
carried off by thieves, rests on nothing, is the sphere in which birds
fly, is unobstructed, and is infinite; \[**321**\] so, O king, Nirvâ*n*a
is not born, neither does it grow old, it dies not, it passes not away,
it has no rebirth (no future life to spring up into), it is
unconquerable, thieves carry it not off, it is not attached to
anything <span id="fr_455"></span>[1](#fn_452.md), it is the sphere in
which Arahats move, nothing can obstruct it, and it is infinite. These
are the ten qualities of space inherent in Nirvâ*n*a.'

72\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those three qualities of the wish-conferring
gem which you said were inherent in Nirvâ*n*a,--which are they?'

'As the wishing-gem, O king, satisfies every desire, so also does
Nirvâ*n*a. This is the first quality of the wishing-gem inherent in
Nirvâ*n*a. And again, O king, as the wishing-gem causes delight, so also
does Nirvâ*n*a. This is the second quality of the wishing-gem inherent
in Nirvâ*n*a. And again, O king, as the wishing-gem is full of lustre,

inherent in Nirvâ*n*a.'

73\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those three qualities of red sandal wood which
you said were inherent in Nirvâ*n*a,--which are they?'

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

'As red sandal wood, O king, is hard to get, so is Nirvâ*n*a hard to
attain to. This is the first quality of red sandal wood inherent in
Nirvâ*n*a. And again, O king, as red sandal wood is unequalled in the
beauty of its perfume, so is Nirvâ*n*a. This is the second quality of
red sandal wood inherent in Nirvâ*n*a. And again, O king, as red sandal
wood is praised by all the good, so is Nirvâ*n*a praised by all the
Noble Ones. This is the third quality of red sandal wood inherent in
Nirvâ*n*a.'

74\. \[**322**\] 'Venerable Nâgasena, those three qualities of the
skimmings of ghee <span id="fr_456"></span>[1](#fn_453.md) which you said
were inherent in Nirvâ*n*a,--which are they?'

'As ghee is beautiful in colour, O king, so also is Nirvâ*n*a beautiful
in righteousness. This is the first quality of the ghee inherent in
Nirvâ*n*a. And again, O king, as ghee has a pleasant perfume, so also
has Nirvâ*n*a the pleasant perfume of righteousness. This is the second
quality of ghee inherent in Nirvâ*n*a. And again, O king, as ghee has a
pleasant taste, so also has Nirvâ*n*a. This is the third quality of ghee
inherent in Nirvâ*n*a.'

75\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those five qualities of a mountain peak which
you said were inherent in Nirvâ*n*a,--which are they?'

'As a mountain peak is very lofty, so also is Nirvâ*n*a very exalted.
This is the first quality of a mountain peak inherent in Nirvâ*n*a. And
again, O king, as a mountain peak is immoveable, so also is Nirvâ*n*a.
This is the second quality of a mountain peak inherent in Nirvâ*n*a. And
again, O king,

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

as a mountain peak is inaccessible, so also is Nirvâ*n*a inaccessible to
all evil dispositions. This is the third quality of a mountain peak
inherent in Nirvâ*n*a. And again, O king, as a mountain peak is a place
where no plants can grow, so also is Nirvâ*n*a a condition in which no
evil dispositions can grow. This is the fourth quality of a mountain
peak inherent in Nirvâ*n*a. And again, O king, as a mountain peak is
free alike from desire to please and from resentment, so also is
Nirvâ*n*a. This is the fifth quality of a mountain peak inherent in
Nirvâ*n*a.'

\[323\] 'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\[DILEMMA THE EIGHTY-FIRST.  
THE TIME OF NIRVANA.\]

76\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, your people say <span
id="fr_457"></span>[1](#fn_454.md):

"Nirvâ*n*a is not past, nor future, nor present, nor produced, nor not
produced, nor producible <span id="fr_458"></span>[2](#fn_455.md)."

'In that case, Nâgasena, does the man who, having ordered his life
aright, realises Nirvâ*n*a, realise something already produced, or does
he himself produce it first, and then realise it?'

'Neither the one, O king, nor the other. And nevertheless, O king, that
principle of Nirvâ*n*a (nibbâna-dhâtu) which he, so ordering his life
aright, realises--that exists.'

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

'Do not, venerable Nâgasena, clear up this puzzle by making it dark!
Make it open and plain as you elucidate it. With a will, strenuous in
endeavour, pour out upon it all that has been taught you. It is a point
on which this people is bewildered, plunged into perplexity, lost in
doubt. Dissipate this guilty uncertainty; it pierces like a dart <span
id="fr_459"></span>[1](#fn_456.md)!'

77\. 'That principle of Nirvâ*n*a, O king, so peaceful, so blissful, so
delicate, exists. And it is that which he who orders his life aright,
grasping the idea of all things (of the Confections, Sa*m*khâras)
according to the teachings of the Conquerors, realises by his
wisdom--even as a pupil, by his knowledge, makes himself, according to
the instruction of his teacher, master of an art.

'And if you ask: "How is Nirvâ*n*a to be known <span
id="fr_460"></span>[2](#fn_457.md)?" it is by freedom from distress and
danger, by confidence, by peace, by calm, by bliss, by happiness, by
delicacy, by purity, by freshness <span id="fr_461"></span>[3](#fn_458.md).

78\. 'Just, O king, as a man being burnt in a blazing fiery furnace
heaped up with many faggots of dry sticks, when he has freed himself
from it by

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

a violent effort, and escaped into a cool place, \[**324**\] would
experience supreme bliss--just so whosoever orders his life aright, he
by his careful thinking will realise the supreme bliss of Nirvâ*n*a, in
which the burning heat of the threefold fire (of lust, malice, and
delusion) <span id="fr_462"></span>[1](#fn_459.md) has all gone out. As the
furnace, O king, so should you regard this threefold fire, as the man
fallen into the fire the man who is ordering his life aright, as the
cool place Nirvâ*n*a.

79\. 'Or again, O king, as a man fallen into a pit full of the dead
bodies of snakes and dogs and men, of ordure, and of refuse, when,
finding himself in the midst of it entangled in the hair of the corpses,
he had by a violent effort escaped into a place where no dead bodies
were, would experience supreme bliss--just so whosoever orders his life
aright, he by his careful thinking will realise the supreme bliss of
Nirvâ*n*a, from which the corpses of all evil dispositions have been
removed <span id="fr_463"></span>[2](#fn_460.md). As a corpse, O king, so
should you regard the four pleasures of sense, as the man fallen among
corpses the man who is ordering his life aright, as the place free from
corpses Nirvâ*n*a.

80\. 'Or again, O king, as a man (fallen among enemies with drawn swords
in their hands) <span id="fr_464"></span>[3](#fn_461.md), quaking with fear
and terror, agitated and upset in mind, when with a violent effort he
has freed himself from them, and escaped into a strong refuge, a firm
place of security, experiences supreme bliss--just so whosoever orders
his life aright, he by his careful thinking will realise the supreme
bliss of Nirvâ*n*a,

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

in which fear and terror have been put away. As the terror, O king, so
should you regard the anxiety which arises again and again on account of
birth, old age, disease, and death, as the terrified man the man who is
ordering his life aright, as the place of refuge Nirvâ*n*a.

81\. 'Or again, O king, as a man fallen on a spot filthy with dirt, and
slime, and mud, when with a violent effort he has got rid of the mud,
and escaped to a clean and spotless place, would experience supreme
bliss-just so whosoever orders his life aright, he by his careful
thinking will realise the supreme bliss of Nirvâ*n*a, from which the
stains and mud of evil dispositions have been removed. As the mud, O
king, \[**325**\] so should you regard income, and honour, and
praise <span id="fr_465"></span>[1](#fn_462.md), as the man fallen into the
mud the man who is ordering his life aright, as the clean and spotless
place Nirvâ*n*a.

82\. 'And if again you should ask: "How does he who orders his life
aright realise that Nirvâ*n*a?" (I should reply), He, O king, who orders
his life aright grasps the truth as to the development of all
things <span id="fr_466"></span>[2](#fn_463.md), and when he is doing so he
perceives therein birth, he perceives old age, he perceives disease, he
perceives death. But he perceives not therein either happiness or bliss,
he perceives not therein, whether in the beginning, or the middle, or
the end, anything worthy of being laid hold of (as lasting
satisfaction) <span id="fr_467"></span>[3](#fn_464.md). As a man, O king,
if a mass of iron

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

had been heated the livelong day <span id="fr_468"></span>[1](#fn_465.md),
and were all glowing, scorching, and red hot, would find no spot on it,
whether at one end or in the middle or at the other end, fit to be taken
hold of--just so, O king, he who orders his life aright grasps the truth
of the development of things, and in doing so he perceives therein
birth, he perceives old age, he perceives disease, he perceives death.
But he perceives not therein either happiness or bliss, he perceives not
therein, whether in the beginning, or in the middle, or in the end,
anything fit to be taken hold of (as a lasting satisfaction).

83\. 'And discontent arises in his mind when he thus finds nothing fit
to be relied on as a lasting satisfaction, and a fever takes possession
of his body <span id="fr_469"></span>[2](#fn_466.md), and without a refuge
or protection, hopeless, he becomes weary of repeated lives <span
id="fr_470"></span>[3](#fn_467.md). As if a man had fallen into a burning
and blazing mighty fiery furnace, and saw no refuge from it, no way of
escape, he would, hopeless, be weary of the fire--just so, O king,
discontent arises in his mind when he thus finds nothing fit to be
relied on as a lasting satisfaction, and a fever takes possession of his
body, and without a refuge or protection, hopeless, he becomes weary of
repeated births.

84\. 'And in the mind of him who thus perceives

 

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

the insecurity of transitory life, (of starting afresh ha innumerable
births) <span id="fr_471"></span>[1](#fn_468.md) the thought arises: "All
on fire is this endless becoming, burning, and blazing! Full of pain is
it, of despair! If only one could reach a state in which there were no
becoming, there would there be calm, that would be sweet-the cessation
of all these conditions <span id="fr_472"></span>[2](#fn_469.md), the
getting rid of all these defects <span id="fr_473"></span>[3](#fn_470.md)
(of lusts, of evil, and of Karma), the end of cravings, the absence of
passion, peace, Nirvâ*n*a!" And therewith does his mind leap forward
into that state in which there is no becoming, and then has he found
peace, \[**326**\] then does he exult and rejoice <span
id="fr_474"></span>[4](#fn_471.md) at the thought: "A refuge have I gained
at last!" Just, O king, as a man who, venturing into a strange land, has
lost his way, on becoming aware of a path, free from jungle, that will
lead him home, bounds forward along it, contented in mind, exulting and
rejoicing at the thought: "I have found the way at last!"--just so in
him who thus perceives the insecurity of transitory births there arises
the thought: "All on fire is this endless becoming, burning, and
blazing! Full of pain is it, and despair! If only one could reach a
state in which there were no becoming, there would there be calm, that
would be sweet-the cessation of all these conditions, the getting rid of
all these defects, the end of cravings, the absence of passion, peace,
Nirvâ*n*a!" And therewith does his mind leap forward into that state in
which there is no becoming,

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

and then has he found peace, then does he exult and rejoice at the
thought: "A refuge have I found at last!" And he strives with might and
main along that path, searches it out, accustoms himself thoroughly to
it, to that end does he make firm his self-possession, to that end does
he hold fast in effort, to that end does he remain stedfast in love
(toward all beings in all the worlds), and still to that does he direct
his mind again and again, until gone far beyond the transitory, he gains
the Real, the highest fruit (of Arahatship) <span
id="fr_475"></span>[1](#fn_472.md). And when he has gained that, O king,
the man who has ordered his life aright has realised, (seen face to
face,) Nirvâ*n*a <span id="fr_476"></span>[2](#fn_473.md)!'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

\[DILEMMA THE EIGHTY-SECOND.  
THE PLACE OF NIRVANA.\]

85\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, does there exist the spot--either in the
direction of the East, or of the South, or of the West, or of the North,
either above, or below, or on the horizon-where Nirvâ*n*a is stored
up <span id="fr_478"></span>[1](#fn_475.md)?'

'There is no spot, O king,--either in the East, or the South, or in the
West, or the North, either above, or below, or on the horizon--where
Nirvâ*n*a is.'

'But if so, Nâgasena, then neither can Nirvâ*n*a exist, and those who
realise it, their realisation is vain. And I will give you an
explanation of this. Just, Sir, as there are on the earth fields in
which crops can be grown, flowers from which perfumes come, bushes on
which flowers can grow, trees on which fruits can ripen, mines from
which gems can be dug, so that whosoever desires any of these things can
go there and get it--just so, Nâgasena, if \[**327**\] Nirvâ*n*a exists
one must expect there to be some place, where it is produced <span
id="fr_479"></span>[2](#fn_476.md). But since there is not, therefore I
declare that there can be no Nirvâ*n*a, and those who realise it, their
realisation is vain.'

86\. 'There is no spot, O king, where Nirvâ*n*a is

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

situate, and yet Nirvâ*n*a is, and he who orders his life right will, by
careful attention, realise Nirvâ*n*a. Just as fire exists, and yet there
is no place where fire (by itself) is stored up. But if a man rubs two
sticks together the fire comes;--just so, O king, Nirvâ*n*a exists,
though there is no spot where it is stored up. And he who orders his
life aright will, by careful attention, realise Nirvâ*n*a.

87\. 'Or again, O king, just as there are the seven treasures of the
king of kings--the treasure of the wheel, and the treasure of the
elephant, and the treasure of the horse, and the treasure of the gem,
and the treasure of the woman, and the treasure of the finance minister,
and the treasure of the adviser. But there is no spot where these
treasures are laid up. When a sovran conducts himself aright they appear
to him of their own accord <span id="fr_480"></span>[1](#fn_477.md)--just
so, O king, Nirvâ*n*a, exists, though there is no place where it is
stored up. And he who orders his life aright will, by careful attention,
realise Nirvâ*n*a.'

88\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, let it be granted that there is no place where
Nirvâ*n*a, is stored up. But is there any place on which a man may stand
and, ordering his life aright, realise Nirvâ*n*a?'

'Yes, O king, there is such a place.'

'Which then, Nâgasena, is that place

'Virtue, O king, is the place. For if grounded in virtue, and careful in
attention--whether in the land of the Scythians <span
id="fr_481"></span>[2](#fn_478.md) or the Greeks, whether in China or

Gandhâra <span id="fr_484"></span>[3](#fn_481.md), whether on a mountain
top <span id="fr_485"></span>[4](#fn_482.md) or in the highest
heavens <span id="fr_486"></span>[5](#fn_483.md)--wheresoever he may be,
the man who orders his life aright will realise Nirvâ*n*a. \[**328**\]
Just, O king, as the man who has eyes wherever he may be--in the land of
the Scythians or the Greeks, in China or in Tartary, in Alexandria,
Nikumba, Benares, or Kosala, in Kashmir or in Gandhâra, on a mountain
top or in the highest heavens--will be able to behold the expanse of
heaven and to see the horizon facing him--just so, O king, will he who
orders his conduct aright and is careful in attention--whether in the
land of the Scythians or the Greeks, whether in China or Tartary,
whether in Alexandria, or Benares, or Kosala, or Nikumba, whether in
Kashmir or in Gandhâra, whether on a mountain top or in the highest
heavens--wheresoever he may be, attain to the realisation of Nirvâ*n*a.'

'Very good, Nâgasena! You have preached to me of Nirvâ*n*a, and of the
realisation thereof, you have set forth the advantages of virtue, you
have explained the supreme attainment, you have raised aloft the
standard of the Truth, you have established the eye of Truth, you have
shown how right means adopted by those of high aims will be neither

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_291"></span>[114:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_293.md) We have seen above,
IV, 1, 41 (1, 178), how Hîna*t*i-kumburê expanded the story of
Vessantara, which had aroused also in our author a greater enthusiasm
than any of the many other subjects that he treats. Here too the
Si*m*halese translator fairly runs riot over the 'mighty giving of the
glorious king,' and expands the ten pages of the Pâli into thirty-three
pages of his version (pp. 389-421), whereas usually one page of the
Si*m*halese covers very nearly a page of the Pâli.

<span id="fn_292"></span>[114:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_294.md) Anuma*gg*iyante.
See Mr. Trenckner's note. But the <span id="page_115">p. 115</span>
Si*m*halese (p. 390) has at mardanaya ko*t*a welannawun dœka.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[115:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_295.md) Rû*l*arû*l*assa
bhîmabhîmassa. The Si*m*halese (p. 390) omits these words, giving other
details in place of them, and as they occur only here I am not sure of
their meaning.

<span id="fn_294"></span>[116:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_296.md) Vikittentâ
vikopentâ. Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p. 410) has 'angrily finding fault with.'
Compare above, vikopanâ, at p. 266 (of the Pâli).

<span id="fn_295"></span>[117:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_297.md) Pakkha-hato vâ
pî*th*a-sappî vâ. See the note above on IV, 6, 22.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[117:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_298.md) Devayâna, on which
compare Sutta Nipâta, verse 139 (Vasala Sutta 24).

<span id="fn_297"></span>[119:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_299.md) Atisa*ñk*ârena,
which the Si*m*halese merely repeats. The meaning is doubtful. The use
of sa*ñk*âra at *G*âtaka II, 112 has suggested the above rendering.

<span id="fn_298"></span>[119:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_300.md) The whole of this
answer turns on the ambiguity of the prefix ati, which may mean either
'very much' or 'too much.'

<span id="fn_299"></span>[119:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_301.md) 'Yâdisa*m*
kîdisa*m*. The meaning of this idiom cannot be controlled by parallel
passages, as I know of none. Hîna*t*i-kumburê (pp. 412-413) construes
yâdisa*m* as an accusative dependent on atidânadâyî; 'Those who give
away anything as a gift, acquire fame in the world as exceeding givers
of that.'

<span id="fn_300"></span>[120:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_302.md) Dakkhi*n*eyya. We
have no word in English to express the full meaning of this word. It was
an idea that was common ground to our Buddhist apologist, and to the
Brahman opponents whom he always has in view, that there were certain
people to whom gifts ought to be given, and the being worthy was one of
the conditions precedent to belonging to this class. Of course the <span
id="page_121">p. 121</span> Brahmans held that to be a Brahman was
another condition, but the Buddhist, who inherited the idea from them,
had discarded this part of the conception. See, for the Brahman view,
Eggeling's *S*atapatha-Brâhma*n*a II, 114, 344.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[121:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_303.md) Sama*gg*a-dâna*m*.
Childers under sama*gg*â gives only the meaning 'assembly,' but it is
clear from *K*ullavagga V, 26; VI, 2, 7; the Sutta Vibhanga II, 267, and
Suma<u>n</u>gala I, 84, that the word, at least as a masculine (which it
is here), has the technical sense of one of those orgies in high places
which were common in so many parts of the world in very early times, and
were due in India to Kolarian influences. The giving' (dâna) of such a
sama*gg*a would doubtless mean the providing of the necessary food,
seats, cushions, &c.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[121:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_304.md) *K*itta-kamma*m*.
See my note on Pa*t*ibhâna-*k*itta*m* at 'Vinaya Texts,' III, 172.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[122:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_305.md) I.e. pieces of
money, which it would be against the rules for a member of the Buddhist
Order to accept. But the donees in all these cases are not necessarily
Buddhists.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[122:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_306.md) Paripâtesi, not in
Childers; but see *G*âtaka II, 208; and below, p. 367 (of the Pâli
text). Hîna*t*i-kumburê has here nindâ karanne, and just below
apasâdanaya karanne.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[122:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_307.md) Âvapitu*m*, not in
Childers. Dr. Morris, in the 'Journal of the Pâli Text Society' for
1886, p. 157, compares the Sanskrit root vyap, but this does not help us
much. Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p. 414) has 'an tœneka œpaye hinduwanna*t*a,'
which means, I think, 'to deposit as a pledge in some place or other.'
At all events œpa, the ordinary word now in use in Ceylon courts for
'bail,' may very well be actually derived from vâpa. And the passage at
*G*âtaka I, 321 is an exact parallel to our phrase here, for there the
Bodisat, when an elephant, gives away his teeth and tusks as vâpana for
the insight of the Omniscient Ones.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[123:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_308.md) Niminitvâ, also not
in Childers; but see *G*âtaka III, 63, 221.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[124:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_309.md) Agapatha*m*
sa<u>n</u>kupatha*m* vettapatha*m* ga*kkh*ati. Hîna*t*i-kumburê, at p.
416, repeats the words with a gloss on the two last words, which I have
followed.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[124:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_310.md) Mudda-kâmo;
mudra-na*m* gana*m* perekkuwa, says Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 416.

<span id="fn_309"></span>[124:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_311.md) Bâhirabbhantara*m*
dhana*m* datvâ. I am not sure that I have rightly understood this
phrase, which the Si*m*halese merely repeats.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[125:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_312.md) *K*ariyâ Pi*t*aka
I, 9, 53.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[125:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_313.md) Dessa, that is
dreshya, from dvish. Compare diso, 'an enemy.' It occurs also at Kariyâ
Pi*t*aka I, 4, 7; 5, 3; 8, 16 (quoted *G*âtaka IV, 406); II, 4, 11; III,
1, 6 (quoted *G*âtaka I, 46); III, 2, 16; 3, 10; 6, 18. The effect of
the use of this rare poetical word is lost in the English version.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[125:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_314.md) Maddî and
Ka*n*hâ*g*inâ, the names of Vessantara's wife and daughter, mean
respectively 'enthraller (of men's minds),' and 'the dark conquerors (of
hearts).' As Vessantara is used in the Ma*ggh*ima (I, 386, line 5) as an
adjective, not a name, and is applied to the Buddha, it too must have a
special meaning. But it can scarcely be connected with Vai*s*ya, while
we have a very famous epithet in vai*s*vânara, so often applied to the
sacred fire as 'common good to all men.' The insertion of the t would
explain the shortening of the â, and though there seems to be no
sufficient reason for any alteration at all of the older term, this is
<span id="page_126">p. 126</span> probably the real derivation of
Vessantara. And the whole legend may well be due to previous stories of
the world-wide beneficence of Agni Vai*s*vânara, or of the sun as
Vai*s*vânara.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[126:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_315.md) Hadaya-vatthu, like
a broth-pot foaming over,' is Hîna*t*i-kumburê's explanation of this
phrase (pena nœgena mas sœliyak men h*ri*daya wastuwa, p. 417).

<span id="fn_314"></span>[127:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_316.md) *K*andima-suriye.
We should say 'the sun and the moon,' and I cannot think the difference
of phraseology is entirely without significance. While the Brahmans put
their own caste and order first, the Buddhist texts talk of 'Samanas and
Brahmans,' 'Khattiyas and Brahmans.' This has, and no doubt rightly,
been held significant of the opinion of the authors. Why should the fact
of their always referring, in similar compounds, to the moon before the
sun, and to women before men, be less so? Now it is almost always taken
for granted that the Buddhists were reformers, as opposed to the
Brahmans, who wanted to run still in the ancient grooves. But there is
another side of the question that has been entirely overlooked. There is
ample evidence in their literature that (at least in certain directions,
more especially of religious thought) the Brahmans had been constantly
progressive, and their Brâhma*n*as are really the result of reform
following on reform. To use a parallel drawn from modern politics,
Buddhists are to Brahmans much more like Socialists to Liberals than
like Liberals to Conservatives. The Brahmans had worked out in their
minds no new complete system, and when they reformed they left the roots
of the old order of things in the ground. But in the momentous change
from matriarchate to patriarchate they threw all their power and
influence on the side of the newer conception. And when, like Kronos to
Jupiter, the old gods gave place to the new, it was they who worked out
the newer set of ideas--more especially heaven or sun-worship as against
moon-worship and all that it involved. We must not forget that a change
of dynasty, or of precedence, among the gods was of more importance to
men in those times than a change of dynasty among earthly kings. And
though the Buddhists it is true, as we ourselves now, cared for none of
these things, and were busied with other discussions than the precedence
of the sun and moon, they quite quietly and naturally, when they had to
choose, adopted the form of words which did not imply an acceptance of
the Brahman position, whose system in other matters they were trying, if
not to storm, at least to turn.

We are here in the midst of questions too vast to be discussed with
profit in a note. But Buddhism certainly arose among those sections of
the community least influenced by the reforms the Brahmans supported.
And there is evidence, in the precedence the <span id="page_127">p.
127</span> Buddhists gave to women and to the moon, that the older ideas
had not, even then, died out.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[128:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_317.md) These words are
repeated before each of the following similes.

<span id="fn_316"></span>[128:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_318.md) Pari*n*âha, which
Childers is wrong in rendering 'breadth,' when not qualified by âyâma
(wa*t*a œttâwû, says the Si*m*halese, p. 418).

<span id="fn_320"></span>[128:6](sbe3606.htm#fr_322.md) Sattappa*tth*ito.
The Si*m*halese merely repeats this ambiguous word (compare IV, 8, 57).

<span id="fn_321"></span>[129:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_324.md) Suppena vâ sarâvena
vâ. Hîna*t*i-kumburê renders the first of these words by kullaka, which
is a winnowing-basket; and the second by malâwaka, which I do not
understand. But the use of sarâva at *G*âtaka I, 8, 14 and
Suma<u>n</u>gala I, 298 seems to me to confirm Childers's rendering.

<span id="fn_322"></span>[129:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_325.md) Mahâbhûta:
'Yakshas' says Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 419. Compare above, p. 250 (of the

<span id="fn_323"></span>[130:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_326.md) Nâga-puppha-samaye.
Hîna*t*i-kumburê says, 'at the time when the Nâ trees bloom.' The Nâ or
Nâga is the Mesua ferea, whose lovely flowers, like those of the
Champak, are still in special request for laying before the images of
the Buddha in Buddhist temples. I am told that these so-called flowers
are not flowers at all, botanically speaking, but young shoots. But it
is one of the most beautiful sights in a Ceylon landscape to see this
splendid forest tree, lofty and wide-spreading as it is, one mass of
what look like red blossoms from crown to root. For at the 'bloom time'
it casts all its green leaves, and has the appearance of a scarlet bell.
No wonder that this was thought supernatural, and that the tree should
be called the Nâga tree. Its timber is so valuable that in Anglo-Indian
the tree is called the 'Iron-wood' tree. But it may be regretted that
the commercial spirit of the European has substituted this hard name for
the 'Fairy tree' of the native languages.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[130:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_327.md) U*g*u-vâta, which
the Si*m*halese repeats.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[130:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_328.md) Compare vol. i, pp.
38, 175.

See my 'Ancient Coins and Measures,' pp. 6, 14; Samyutta Nikâya II, 3,

<span id="fn_327"></span>[131:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_330.md) Anuyâyino. Not
found elsewhere, and not in Childers. But anuyâyati occurs below (p. 391
of the text) and an ânuyâyin at Sutta Nipâta V, 7, 3, 4 and
Tela-ka*t*âha-gâthâ 25 (compare 41). Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p. 470) has anuwa
hœsirew.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[132:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_331.md) Kula-vemattatâ.
Those Bodisats who are to become Buddhas in their then lives may be born
either in a Brahman or in a Kshatriya family, but in no other.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[132:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_332.md) Addhâna-vemattatâ,
which is ambiguous, as 'period-difference' may mean different things
according to the interpretation given to 'period.' Now the Bodisat
theory has never been thoroughly worked out in detail. It is clear from
the statements given in pp. 38-58 of my 'Buddhist Birth Stories' that
the Bodisat who became Gotama the Buddha was held to have been in
existence throughout the whole period in which the former twenty-four
Buddhas appeared, and this is probably the 'period' intended.
Hîna*t*i-kumburê's version (p. 421) is as ambiguous as the Pâli. Spence
Hardy gives at p. 87 of his 'Manual of Buddhism' what purports to be a
translation of our passage. But it is only a loose paraphrase, and he
interprets this 'period-difference' as simply <span id="page_133">p.
133</span> identical with the next one in the list, the
'length-of-life-difference'--which must be wrong.

It must be remembered that the Bodisats referred to throughout this
dilemma are exclusively men--not those mentioned in the *G*âtakas (who
are all Bodisats of the historical Buddha), but only those Bodisats who
became Buddhas in the same life--that is, the Buddhas themselves before
they reached Buddhahood.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[133:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_333.md) Âyu-vemattatâ. This
may be due to either of two causes--in the first place they may be born
as creatures whose allotted period of life varies. Thus the Bodisat was
twenty times Sakka, the king of the gods; and his life would then have
lasted hundreds of thousands of years. But he was 106 times an animal of
some kind, and then his life would have been of course much shorter.
Again, in his births as a man (more than 350 times, see the table in my
'Buddhist Birth Stories,' p. ci), the average duration of men's lives
will have varied, according to Buddhist theory, from many centuries down
to only a few years. It is in this second sense only that (with
Hîna*t*i-kumburê) we must suppose the phrase âyu-vemattatâ to be
used--thus excluding all the Bodisats except such as were men. But in
the *G*âtaka stories the average age of man is (with one or two
exceptions) normal.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[133:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_334.md) Pamâ*n*a-vemattatâ,
which we must also understand to refer only to the varying average size
of mankind, which, according to Buddhist theory, is very great at the
commencement, and very small at the close, of a Kalpa. For it is only
the men-Bodisats, and only in each series the last man-Bodisat (just
before he became 'Buddha'), concerning whom this question of penance
could arise.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[133:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_335.md) Rûpe, which the
Si*m*halese repeats (p. 422), and which cannot here mean bodily form
only.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[134:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_336.md) *K*atu-vesâra*gg*e.
They are the confidence that no one--Sama*n*a or Brahman, God or
Mâra--can reprove him by saying: (1) 'The qualities which you maintain
to be those of a Buddha have not been attained by you;' or (2) 'The
Great Evils which you maintain to have ceased in an Arahat have not
ceased in you;' or (3) 'The qualities which you say are dangerous (in
the higher life) are not really dangerous to one who practises them;' or
(4) 'The aim which you held before others in preaching your Dhamma will
not lead him who follows it to the destruction of sorrow.' The list will
be found in the A<u>n</u>guttara Nikâya IV, 8 (where it is probably a
quotation from one of the conversational Suttas). But the punctuation in
Dr. Morris's edition should be corrected by putting full stops after
each viharâmi. Childers gives a different explanation under vesâra*gg*a,
but his interpretation must be altered to that here given, which is the
only correct one.

<span id="fn_334"></span>[134:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_337.md) These have not been
found in any Pi*t*aka text, but Burnouf gives them in a note to the
'Lotus de la Bonne Loi' (p. 781) from the *G*inâla<u>n</u>kâra. He says
the expression dasabalo is found as applied to the Buddha 'à chaque
instant dans les textes,' but this is not the case, so far at least as
the older texts are concerned. In one of the old verses preserved at the
Mahâvagga I, 22, 13, and quoted in the *G*âtaka (vol. i, p. 84),
dasabalo occurs as an epithet of the Buddha, but among the numerous
epithets applied in the Buddhavamsa to the various Buddhas the term does
not occur, nor have I been able to find it in the published portions of
any of the great Nikâyas. (Ten Nâga-balas are ascribed to the Buddha in
Buddhavamsa, p. 39, but these seem to be different.) Buddha-rakkhita,
the author of the *G*inâla<u>n</u>kâra, probably lived at about the
eleventh or twelfth century A.D., and Hardy's paraphrase of his
interpretations (in the 'Manual of Buddhism,' pp. 380, 381) is
throughout inaccurate. As therefore it is precisely the growth of ideas
about the Buddha that is of prime importance in the history of Buddhism,
I give here Buddha-rakkhita's explanation, adding the Sanskrit names as
given in the Mahâvyutpatti, § 8:--

Some of these terms are found in the Dharma-sa<u>n</u>graha, Anecdota
Oxoniensia, vol. i, part 5, pp. 16, 51.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[135:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_338.md)
*Kh*a-asâdhâra*n*a-*ñ*âna, not yet found elsewhere.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[135:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_339.md) Possibly the above
ten with four others.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[135:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_340.md) The details of
these eighteen are given by Spence Hardy in the 'Manual of Buddhism,' p.
381, but he does not mention his authority. Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p. 422)
merely repeats the Pâli.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[135:4](sbe3606.htm#fr_341.md) 'Of the four
Truths' is Hîna*t*i-kumburê's gloss.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[135:5](sbe3606.htm#fr_342.md) See *G*âtaka I, 61.
But the whole episode is told in the Pi*t*akas, not of the Bodisat, but
of Yasa (Mahâvagga I, 7).

<span id="fn_340"></span>[137:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_343.md) Upâdânakkhaya*m*
patto. Childers says that the destruction of these upâdânas 'constitutes
Arahatship.' I know of no authority for this, and it is incompatible
with the Buddhist theory of Arahatship that any Arahat should go through
such a period of penance as our author supposes the Bodisat to have done
after he had reached this 'destruction of the upâdânas.' The perception
of the first of the above facts, the impermanence of all things and
beings (ani*kk*am), constitute indeed the 'entrance upon the path' (see
above, [p. 25](sbe3603.htm#page_25).md), and of course the upâdânas are
destroyed in every Arahat, but that is very different from Childers's
conclusion, which would make the terms convertible.

<span id="fn_341"></span>[138:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_344.md) Pâtâla-mukha*m*,
which the Si*m*halese repeats. There is a similar sequence in the
Sa*m*yutta I, 5, 4.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[138:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_345.md)
Aparimita-*g*ala-dharo. Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 424, has dhârî, which may
either be the same in meaning as dharo, or refer to the dhârâ, the
streams of water.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[138:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_346.md) Gopade; not in
Childers, but compare Gopadaka, 'puddle,' in a similar connection at
Suma<u>n</u>gala Vilâsinî I, 147 (where one MS. reads Gopade).

<span id="fn_344"></span>[140:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_347.md) Kamma is here
explained by Hîna*t*i-kumburê by karmânta ('such as husbandry or
merchandise').

<span id="fn_345"></span>[140:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_348.md) On this list of
epithets compare above, p. 229 (of the Pâli).

<span id="fn_346"></span>[140:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_349.md) Kamma-dhoreyyo. The
latter word is not in Childers. Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p. 427) has karmayama
usulannâ wû. It is the Sanskrit dhaureya, and the whole might be
rendered 'like a beast of burden whose load is action.'

<span id="fn_347"></span>[140:4](sbe3606.htm#fr_350.md) Appamâdo--that
constant theme of praise and exhortation in the early Buddhist books.

<span id="fn_348"></span>[141:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_351.md) These words,
already quoted above, IV, 6, 20 (p. 244 of the Pâli), are put into the
mouth of the Bodisat, after the conclusion of the 'penance,' in the Mahâ
Sa*kk*aka Sutta (M. I, 246), which is the chief Pi*t*aka text on the
penance (the Dukkha-kârikâ). The Si*m*halese version here (p. 427) has
already been given in the note on the former passage.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[141:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_352.md) The way to
Buddhahood (not the way to Arahatship). This is Hîna*t*i-kumburê's
explanation, which agrees with the context.

<span id="fn_350"></span>[141:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_353.md) It will be noticed
that (the destruction of the Âsavas being Arahatship, not Buddhahood)
this is really no reply.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[141:4](sbe3606.htm#fr_354.md) Makkho,
'depreciation of the good qualities of others,' says Hîna*t*i-kumburê,
pp. 427, 564. But the use of the word at *G*âtaka I, 385; Mahâvagga I,
15, 4; *K*ullavagga III, 34, 2; Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya I, 15, shows that
concealing one's own faults is rather the meaning.

<span id="fn_352"></span>[141:5](sbe3606.htm#fr_355.md) Pâlâso; not in
Childers. But see A<u>n</u>guttara Nikâya II, 6, 12; Puggala Paññatti
II, 2; Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya I, 15, &c. This and the last are usually
mentioned together (see for instance below, VII, 2, 18), and the
contrast is 'concealing the faults one has, and laying claim to virtues
one has not.'

<span id="fn_353"></span>[141:6](sbe3606.htm#fr_356.md) Mâyâ. It is
noteworthy that this famous word, which plays so great a part in the
later philosophies, and which is often supposed <span id="page_142">p.
142</span> to express a fundamental conception of the Buddhists, has not
yet been traced, and will probably never be found, in the Pi*t*akas, in
any other than this subordinate and purely ethical sense. So when Mr.
Gough in his 'Philosophy of the Upanishads' says, p. 186, that
'pessimism, metempsychosis, and mâyâ (the primitive world fiction) are
retained in Buddhism' he is as wrong about mâyâ as he is about
metempsychosis. He is evidently still under the delusion that Buddhism
teaches the transmigration of souls, and that it has inherited from such
schoolmen as *S*a<u>n</u>karâ*k*ârya the theory of the mâyâ. This is as
funny as the astounding blindness which makes him say (pp. 267, 268)
'there is no quest of verity of an active law of righteousness (in
Buddhism), but only a yearning after a lapse into the void'(!). The
converse proposition would be nearer to the actual fact, and the
Buddhist Avi*gg*â is quite different from the Mâyâ of the later
Vedântists. How absolutely different is the world in which the thoughts
of a Buddhist would move is shown by Hîna*t*i-kumburê's gloss: 'The mâyâ
of concealing faults one has' (tamâge œti agu*n*a sa*m*gawana mâyâ).

<span id="fn_354"></span>[142:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_357.md) Thambho (not
'stupor,' as Childers has it). 'That obstinacy of mind (dri*dh*awû sit
œti bawa) which will not bend to the exhortation of the great,' says the
Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_355"></span>[142:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_358.md) Sârambho; not
merely 'clamour, angry talk,' as Childers has it. See the commentary on
the word sârambhî at *G*âtaka III, 259, with which Hîna*t*i-kumburê here
agrees. 'Contrariness' would be perhaps a better rendering.

<span id="fn_356"></span>[142:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_359.md) Thînamiddha*m*; so
Hîna*t*i-kumburê (but he takes them as two).

<span id="fn_357"></span>[142:4](sbe3606.htm#fr_360.md) Tandî, as
Hîna*t*i-kumburê reads (for Mr. Trenckner's nandî).

<span id="fn_358"></span>[142:5](sbe3606.htm#fr_361.md) Khudâ pipâsâ, which
must be taken separately to make up the twenty-five. The Si*m*halese
takes them as two.

<span id="fn_359"></span>[142:6](sbe3606.htm#fr_362.md) Arati, which the
Si*m*halese (taking thîna and middha separately) omits.

<span id="fn_360"></span>[143:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_363.md) Pariyâdiyi*m*su;
literally 'were suffused as to the body of' (Hîna*t*i-kumburê has
*s*arîrayehi vyâpta wû). The passive forms of this verb are always
difficult to translate. See above, [p. 254](sbe3608.htm#page_254.md), and
below, pp. 296, 297 (of the Pâli), and *K*ullavagga VI, 2, 6; VII, 2, 1.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[143:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_364.md) This passage
follows in the Mahâ Sa*kk*aka Sutta immediately after the passage quoted
above (Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya I, 246), and the <span id="page_143">p.
143</span> incident is also related at *G*âtaka I, 57. But in both these
books there is reference only to the first--not to the second, third,
and fourth *Gh*ânas. As this is therefore only another instance of the
difference between the Pi*t*akas and the more advanced views of our
author, I have not translated the remaining *Gh*ânas. As will be seen
from the version of them in my 'Buddhist Suttas from the Pâli' (S. B.
E., vol. xi, p. 272), the idea that a mere baby could have practised
these higher meditations would only become possible after the Buddha
theory had been much more developed than it is in the Pi*t*akas.

<span id="fn_362"></span>[144:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_365.md) Kusala*m*. So it
has been already laid down at III, 7, 7 (pp. 83, 84 of the Pâli), that
merit (pu*ññ*a*m*) is more than demerit.

<span id="fn_363"></span>[145:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_366.md) This is a
repetition of the list given above (I, 276-278), where the technical
terms are explained. Compare Mr. William Andrews's book, 'Punishments in
the Olden Time.'

<span id="fn_364"></span>[145:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_367.md) Saparivâra*m*
dâna*m*. Pirikara-sahita-wû mahâ dan dî, says the Si*m*halese, p. 430.

<span id="fn_365"></span>[145:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_368.md) The words in
brackets are supplied from Hîna*t*i-kumburê.

<span id="fn_366"></span>[146:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_369.md) The king himself
has already mentioned them, in reverse order, above, I, 172.

<span id="fn_367"></span>[146:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_370.md) The legends will be
found in full in the *G*âtaka stories numbered respectively, in
Professor Fausböll's edition, 258, 533, 494, and 243.

<span id="fn_368"></span>[146:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_371.md)
Pa*t*i*kkh*âdaniya*m*. See the note on Mahâvagga VI, 23) where this
curious story is given in full.

<span id="fn_369"></span>[146:4](sbe3606.htm#fr_372.md) See *G*âtaka III,
495, 496 for this story. Âbhidosika*m* is not in Childers, but see the
Sutta Vibhanga, Pârâ*g*ika I, 5, 6.

<span id="fn_370"></span>[147:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_373.md) 'Received from the
king the great honour (sammâna) called sabba*tth*aka,' says
Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 431. But we find a particular office so called at
Gâtaka II, 57. (It is true the reading there is sabbatthaka, but Mr.
Trenckner's reading is doubtless preferable.)

<span id="fn_371"></span>[147:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_374.md) All these cases
have already been referred to above, I, 172.

<span id="fn_372"></span>[147:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_375.md) 'Nandagutta of the
Brahman caste,' says the Si*m*halese, p. 431.

<span id="fn_373"></span>[147:4](sbe3606.htm#fr_376.md) Descended from the
*S*âkya race,' adds Hîna*t*i-kumburê.

<span id="fn_374"></span>[148:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_377.md) The Pâli being
otherwise unintelligible, the above version has been expanded in
accordance with the Si*m*halese interpretation. Kavandha as a living
headless trunk occurs already in the Sutta Vibha<u>n</u>ga, Pârâgika IV,
9, 3.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[148:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_378.md) Aparante. This may
mean merely the western country (as at *G*âtaka I, 98), or may be a
specific place name as Aparântika is in the 'Indian Antiquary,' VII,
263.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[148:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_379.md) So the Si*m*halese,
which seems to follow a slightly different reading.

<span id="fn_377"></span>[149:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_380.md) Upaka*kkh*ake. The
word is not in the: Pâli dictionaries, but I follow Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p.
432, who renders it Kisilla, and the context at the parallel passage,
*G*âtaka I, 63 (see also *G*âtaka I, 158, and the Sutta Vibhanga II,
260).

<span id="fn_378"></span>[150:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_381.md) Bhettabbo, 'have
their arms or legs broken.'

<span id="fn_379"></span>[150:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_382.md) In this sentence
the translation follows Hîna*t*i-kumburê, who has apparently had a
different, and fuller, reading before him.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[151:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_383.md) Petâ; which are not
ghosts, disembodied 'souls,' but new beings whose link of connection
with the departed is, 'not soul,' but Karma.

<span id="fn_381"></span>[151:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_384.md) Vissota*m*, from
sru. The Si*m*halese, p. 434, has âsthâna gata wanneya (for asthâna).

<span id="fn_382"></span>[153:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_385.md) Vâmagâhino
vi*k*akkhukâ. Neither of these words are in the dictionaries.
Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 436, says, 'who spoil what they take hold of, and
whose eyes have lost their cunning.'

<span id="fn_383"></span>[153:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_386.md) Otâra, which the
Si*m*halese renders awakâ*s*aya; and in that sense the word is used at
Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya I, 334.

<span id="fn_384"></span>[154:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_387.md) Pariyâdiyati. See
the note above at IV, 8, 23.

<span id="fn_385"></span>[154:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_388.md) A similar metaphor
is used below, IV, 8, 55 (p. 311 of the Pâli).

<span id="fn_386"></span>[154:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_389.md) This long list is
made up of the two given above at pp. 35, <span id="page_155">p.
155</span> 259 of the Pâli (Paragraphs II, 1, 10 and IV, 6, 55 of the
translation).

<span id="fn_387"></span>[155:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_390.md) The Buddhist
Sabbath. See 'Buddhism,' pp. 140, 141.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[155:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_391.md) Âva*gg*eya, which
the Si*m*halese, p. 437, merely repeats, is ambiguous (literally cause
to bend towards'). Compare *G*âtaka I, 74, 89, 108, 171 11, 243. In most
places the meaning 'bend back or towards' comes to have the secondary
sense of 'reflect.' But throughout this discussion there is an
underlying reference to a very beautiful Buddhist conception that a man
can transfer to others the merit of any good deed he has done. Thus at
the end of a palm-leaf manuscript the copyist often adds the pious wish:
'May the merit of my having made this copy redound to the advantage of
all men,' or words to that effect. And the preceding metaphor would seem
to show that this must be the secondary sense here attached to I causing
to bend towards;'--the more he <span id="page_156">p. 156</span> spends
(as it were) his virtue, the more remains, just as however much the
water flows away from the spring, still quite as much remains, and he
can still share with others that which is left. The doctrine of imputed
righteousness is not confined to Buddhists, but the Buddhist theory is
really quite different from the corresponding Western ideas, even from
the Catholic doctrine of the transference of the righteousness of
saints.

<span id="fn_389"></span>[156:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_392.md) So already above,
III, 7, 7 (I, 128).

<span id="fn_390"></span>[156:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_393.md) Patilîyati
patiku*t*ati pativa*tt*ati na sampasârîyati. None of these words are in
the dictionaries.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[156:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_394.md) Na pariva*ddh*ate;
literally 'is not dilated.'

<span id="fn_392"></span>[157:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_395.md) Nimittam, aramunuwa
in the Si*m*halese, p. 438.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[157:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_396.md) Vâtiko, which
Childers renders wrongly rheumatic. Wâta prak*ri*ti wâ, says the
Si*m*halese, p. 438.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[157:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_397.md) The Si*m*halese
gives the different kinds of dreams seen by each of these six--the first
dreams of journeys through space, the second of fire and conflagrations,
the third of water, the fourth <span id="page_158">p. 158</span> of good
or bad things according as the god is kindly or malignant, the fifth of
what he has himself seen or heard, and the last of his future gain or
loss.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[159:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_398.md) Okkante middhe;
'like a monkey's sleep,' says Hîna*t*i-kumburê.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[159:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_399.md) On bhava<u>n</u>ga
compare Abhidhammattha Sa<u>n</u>gaha III, 8.

<span id="fn_397"></span>[159:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_400.md) 'Like a bird that
has re-entered its nest' is Hîna*t*i-kumburê's gloss.

<span id="fn_398"></span>[159:4](sbe3606.htm#fr_401.md)
Appa*t*ivi*g*ânantassa, 'does not know the distinctions between bliss
and woe (sukha dukkha vibhâga),' says the Si*m*halese, p. 440.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[160:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_402.md) Nirodha, which the
Si*m*halese repeats. Probably the fourth *Gh*âna is here referred to.

<span id="fn_400"></span>[161:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_403.md) Onâho pariyoniho,
'obstruction, covering.' See the Tevi*gg*a Sutta, § 58.

<span id="fn_401"></span>[161:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_404.md)
Voki*nn*aka*m*saggati. 'Destroys sleep by scattered thoughts,' says the
Si*m*halese, p. 441.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[162:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_405.md) It is not known
whether the whole of this theory of dreams is taken from the Pi*t*akas,
or whether it is an expansion of views there suggested. But the germs of
the theory are certainly in the Pi*t*akas. Thus the Buddha is made at
Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya I, 249, 250 to say of himself that in his midday sleep
be was neither stupefied nor the contrary (neither sammûlho nor
asammûlho), which comes very near to the 'monkey's sleep' referred to
throughout this dilemma.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[162:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_406.md) Vilînani, wilikun
wû says Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p. 442).

<span id="fn_404"></span>[163:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_407.md) This simile has
already been used above, IV, 3, 7 (I, 235).

<span id="fn_405"></span>[163:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_408.md) Gati-patibâ*lh*â,
gamana bâhulyatâwen says the Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[163:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_409.md) Upahat-abbhantaro,
'whose interior is burnt by the fierceness of the stomach fire'
(ga*th*arâgni-gaha*n*i), says Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 443.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[164:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_410.md) Hîna*t*i-kumburê
had apparently a different reading (perhaps eka*m*se na vadâmi). For he
translates, p. 444, 'In this death I do not say that there is one
cause.'

<span id="fn_408"></span>[164:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_411.md) As was noticed
above on p. 112 (of the Pâli), some of these medical terms are very
uncertain, and the Si*m*halese gives no help.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[164:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_412.md) Not traced in the
Pi*t*akas.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[165:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_413.md) Sâmâyiko, 'timely,'
but Childers says 'temporary,' and we have had the word above (p. 22 of
the Pâli) in the sense of' religious.' The Si*m*halese, p. 445, repeats
the word.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[165:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_414.md) Yama-visaya, 'abode
of the god of death.'

<span id="fn_412"></span>[166:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_415.md) Sarnâhato. Compare
above, pp. 181, 254 of the Pâli, and Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya I, 337.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[171:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_416.md) Uparato, for which
Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 449, has upahata wîyœyi.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[171:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_417.md)
Otaka-vitaka-âkinna. Gha*n*ayawû pata*l*awû âkîr*nn*awû says the
Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_415"></span>[173:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_418.md) Ma*ñ*garita-patte,
which the Si*m*halese renders karal patra œttâwû.

<span id="fn_416"></span>[173:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_419.md) Karaka-vassa*m* is
pâ*s*âna-warsha in the Si*m*halese. If karaka originally meant 'hard
shell,' it could have reached its ordinary meaning of 'water-pot,' from
the fact that an empty half of a cocoa-nut shell is the most common form
of cup.

<span id="fn_417"></span>[174:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_420.md) Vibhûta*m* kata*m*
is rendered prasiddha kara*n*a laddeya in the Si*m*halese, p. 451.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[174:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_421.md) Parinibbutâna*m*.
The words in brackets are Hîna*t*i-kumburê's gloss, 'Of all who have
been entirely set free' is an alternative, and perhaps a better,
rendering.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[175:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_422.md) Mr. Trenckner
prints eva*m*-nâma as qualifying *K*etiya. The Si*m*halese, p. 451,
takes it as I have rendered.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[176:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_423.md) These words are
very ambiguous, and unfortunately the Si*m*halese (p. 452), though much
expanded, is equally so. The kind of wonder referred to throughout the
dilemma is also doubtful. The only one of the kind mentioned, so far as
I know, in the Pi*t*akas is that referred to in the 'Book of the Great
Decease,' V, 26, where the placing of garlands on a *K*etiya produces
calm in the heart. But it is difficult to believe that our author had
merely a spiritual experience of this kind in his thoughts. The whole
discussion points rather to the late date at which he wrote.

<span id="fn_421"></span>[177:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_424.md) Theyya-sa*m*vâsaka.
See Mahâvagga I, 69, 4.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[177:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_425.md)
Titthiya-pakkantaka, 'gone over to the Titthiyas.'

<span id="fn_423"></span>[177:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_426.md) Garukâpatti, which
Hîna*t*i-kumburê takes to be equivalent to the Sa*m*ghâdisesa offences.
This is doubtless correct, and the use of the phrase in that sense is a
sign of our author's later date.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[177:4](sbe3606.htm#fr_427.md) Viruddhâ, 'placed
in a class' (woed<u>œ</u>rum wû), says the Si*m*halese, p. 453. It is
literally 'opposed,' and the idiom is curious.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[178:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_428.md) The words in
brackets are added from the Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[178:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_429.md) Similar metaphors
have already been used in the 71st Dilemma (p. 283 of the Pâli) and in
the 74th Dilemma (p. 295 of the Pâli).

<span id="fn_427"></span>[179:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_430.md) In the text the
whole comparison is repeated.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[179:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_431.md) For a similar
metaphor see above, IV, 8, 31 (p. 296 of the Pâli).

<span id="fn_429"></span>[180:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_432.md) It is unknown what
this kimi (insect, vermin, small creature) is, and it is not mentioned
elsewhere. Su*s*ruta mentions a *s*ârikâmukha insect, and as in one rare
word at least, which the Pâli translator did not sufficiently understand
to restore to the ordinary Pâli form (kalasi for karisi, see above, I,
xxiii), we find la stood in our author's dialect for ri, there may be
some connection between the two. It would be particularly interesting to
be able to determine the species and habitat of this creature, as it
might throw some light on the district in which our author flourished.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[180:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_433.md) These measurements
differ slightly from those given above, IV, 8, 14 (p. 282 of the Pâli),
for a fine elephant.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[180:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_434.md) Compare the tale of
the frog who wanted to swallow the bull in Æsop's fables (not yet traced
in the *G*âtakas). Is the Sâlaka a kind of frog, much smaller than ours?

<span id="fn_432"></span>[180:4](sbe3606.htm#fr_435.md) So
Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 455.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[181:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_436.md) The following pages
will seem only so much verbiage, and will convey no idea to a European
reader, unless he realises that the Nirvâ*n*a discussed is of course not
a salvation to be enjoyed by a 'soul' after death, and in some other
world; but a state of mind to be realised and enjoyed by a man here, on
this earth, in this life, and in this life only.

Though I had pointed this out already in 1876 the animistic
interpretation of Nirvâ*n*a is still the prevalent one, and still
continues to lead to endless confusion. Why is it then, the reader may
ask, that our author does not contradict the Christian interpretation of
the Buddhist summum bonum in so many words? Simply because it never
occurred to him as possible. It was probably even as inconceivable to
him as the Buddhist interpretation of it seems to be to most Western
writers.

<span id="fn_434"></span>[181:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_437.md) This dilemma and
the next have been translated into French in the 'Revue de l'histoire
des Religions' for 1885 (vol. xi, pp. 336 and following). The author's
name being given as Mr. Lewis da Sylva, of Colombo, the article as it
stands is presumably a translation into French, made in Paris, of Mr. da
Sylva's version in English from the Si*m*halese, which may account for
the fact that there is scarcely a sentence which is not misleading.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[183:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_438.md) In the Mâgandiya
Sutta, No. 75 in the Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya, where the speech will be found
at I, 502.

<span id="fn_436"></span>[183:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_439.md) Bhûtaha*kk*e. See
Mr. Trenckner's valuable note. Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 456, quotes the
Pâli, reading Bhûtahu, and rendering it 'anabhiw*ri*ddhi-kara*n*ayek.

<span id="fn_437"></span>[186:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_440.md) So the Pâli
(vaya*m*). But the Si*m*halese has wâsaya, 'dwelling-place,' throughout
§§ 56 and 57.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[186:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_441.md) Atthi-dhammassa
nibbânassa. The Si*m*halese, p. 459, translates 'the form, &c., of the
quality (dharma) of Nirvâ*n*a'--as if the Pâli were nibbâna-dhammassa.
But see next page, note 2.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[187:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_442.md) Lokakkhâyikâ,
'those who have in former days enquired into and described the world,'
says the Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[187:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_443.md) Atthidhammassa
again, which Hîna*t*i-kumburê now renders œti swabhawawû. 'Pourquoi
réponds-tu ainsi au sujet de l'état naturel du grand océan,' says the
French. (Compare above, p. 270 of the Pâli.)

<span id="fn_441"></span>[187:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_444.md) Arûpakâyikâ. It is
very odd that Hîna*t*i-kumburê takes the word here, and in the answer,
as a feminine singular, and still <span id="page_188">p. 188</span> more
so that the French translation takes it throughout as a masculine
singular. But the Si*m*halese throughout the sequel treats it properly
as a plural nominative; and there can be little doubt that the
inhabitants, or some of the inhabitants, of the 'Formless Realm,' the
Arâpâva*k*ara or Arûpa-brahma-loka, are referred to. But this name is
different from those given to any of these gods in Childers, and I
cannot trace it in the Pi*t*akas as applied to any of them.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[188:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_445.md) I follow the Pâli,
which still has vaya*m*. The Si*m*halese has here and below winâ*s*aya.

<span id="fn_443"></span>[188:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_446.md) Atthisattana*m*
yeva, which the Si*m*halese, p. 460, represents merely by œttâwû.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[189:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_447.md) A*ññ*ehi
anupavi*tth*a*m*; 'not previously explained by others,' says
Hîna*t*i-kumburê. Neither rendering is altogether satisfactory. Perhaps
'of which you have been convinced by others,' in agreement with the use
of the word above, p. 270 of the Pâli.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[189:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_448.md) In the French of
Mr. da Sylva this sentence runs (p. 342): 'Mais vénérable, n'y a-t-il
pas une vertu du Nirvâ*n*a dont on puisse percevoir quelque
ressemblance.'

<span id="fn_446"></span>[189:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_449.md) That is, no drop of
water adheres to the lotus, though it is surrounded by water and water
may fall on it. For instances of the frequent similes drawn from this
fact see below, V, 14; and Dhammapada 401; Sutta Nipâta II, 14, 17; III,
9, 3 2; IV, 6, 9. The French translation is: 'de même que le lotus élève
fièrement sa tête au-dessus de l'eau' (!).

<span id="fn_447"></span>[190:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_450.md) On these
fundamental conceptions see my notes in 'Buddhist Suttas,' pp. 148, 149,
where it is shown that the' three cravings' which end in Nirvâ*n*a are
pretty much the same as the lust of the flesh, theism, and materialism.

<span id="fn_448"></span>[190:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_451.md) Amata, the
translation of which word by 'immortality' has given rise to so much
confusion. So the French here says 'la médecine a le pouvoir de
combattre la mort,' which is nearly as bad. See the Appendix.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[191:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_452.md) See on this belief
above, IV, 3, 39 (I, 269).

<span id="fn_450"></span>[191:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_453.md) The word used here
for free, empty (su*ññ*a), has again given rise to the most odd
misconceptions. As Nirvâ*n*a is hence called Sunyatâ, 'emptiness,'
Christian writers (taking Nirvâ*n*a as a name for some kind of future
life) have very naturally thought, in trying to fasten some meaning upon
emptiness in a future life, that it must mean 'annihilation of a soul,'
and have labelled Buddhism as Nihilism! The real meaning is really very
simple, and entirely ethical (not metaphysical or animistic):

'Men may rise on stepping stones  
Of their dead selves to higher things.'

See below, IV, 8, 78, for a metaphor founded on a similar idea.

<span id="fn_451"></span>[191:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_454.md) Sa*m*kusumito, only
found here. Compare 'garlands, vitvam,' 175, 176.

<span id="fn_452"></span>[193:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_455.md) Anissita*m*, so
below, p. 351 of the Pâli, the dhuta<u>n</u>ga*m* is said to be
anissita*m*. The translation is difficult. In our passage here
Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p. 464) renders it, as applied both to space and to
Nirvâ*n*a, by 'having no â*s*rawa.' Below, as applied to the vows
(dhuta<u>n</u>gas), he renders it (p. 512) by 'unconnected with craving'
(t*ri*sh*n*âni*s*rita). 'Self-dependent' or 'untarnished (by reliance on
external things') would suit the context in all three passages.

<span id="fn_453"></span>[194:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_456.md) This is butter made
of buffaloes' milk, and is highly esteemed in India.

<span id="fn_454"></span>[195:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_457.md) Not yet traced in
the Pi*t*akas.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[195:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_458.md) 'By the action of
Karma as a pre-existing cause' is to be understood.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[196:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_459.md) Bhind' eta*m*
anto-dosa-salla*m*; break and take away the dart of the guilt (dosa) of
that doubt which has arisen in my inmost being (satana),' says
Hîna*t*i-kumburê. It is literally 'break this dart of guilt within.' The
meaning is clear enough (except as to whether the guilt is the speaker's
or 'this people's'). To break a dart in a wound would be no kindness,
and that cannot have been the author's idea. To bring out the meaning
one must amplify a little, and I should have followed the Si*m*halese
had it not seemed preferable to leave the personality of the guilty one
as ambiguous in the translation as in the text.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[196:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_460.md) Hîna*t*i-kumburê,
p. 467, does actually put these words into Nâgasena's mouth.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[196:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_461.md) Sîtalato, literally
'by cold.' See the note above on III, 6, 6 (I, 119).

<span id="fn_459"></span>[197:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_462.md) Râga, dosa, moha.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[197:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_463.md) Compare above, IV,
8, 69, and the note there.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[197:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_464.md) The words in
brackets are added from the Si*m*halese, p. 467.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[198:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_465.md) So also at *G*âtaka
IV, 222 (verse 48).

<span id="fn_463"></span>[198:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_466.md) Sa*m*khârâna*m*
paratta*m* sammasati. Compare [Dhammapada](errata.htm#0.md), verse 374.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[198:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_467.md) Gayhûpagam; so the
Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[199:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_468.md) Divasa-santatta. So
Hîna*t*i-kumburê, and compare Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya I, 4 5 3, and *G*âtaka
IV, 118 (where the reading is diva-santatta). See also above, p. 46 of
the Pâli.

<span id="fn_466"></span>[199:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_469.md) For *d*âho
okkamati, Hîna*t*i-kumburê may have had a different reading. He renders
*d*ahadiya selawenneya, 'sweat shapes' (sic for forms').

<span id="fn_467"></span>[199:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_470.md) Bhavesu; literally
'of becomings' ('in any of the three worlds,' adds the Si*m*halese).

<span id="fn_468"></span>[200:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_471.md) Pavatte. I have
included Hîna*t*i-kumburê's explanation of this word, for which there is
no equivalent in English.

<span id="fn_469"></span>[200:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_472.md) Sa*m*khâra,
sa*m*khâra-dharmayangê says the Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_470"></span>[200:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_473.md) Upadhi; the
Si*m*halese (p. 470) has simply kle*s*ayan.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[200:4](sbe3606.htm#fr_474.md) Paha*m*sîyati
kuhûyati, both words only found here.

<span id="fn_472"></span>[201:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_475.md) Appavattam
okkamati, Apraw*ri*ttiya yayi kiyana lada Arhat-phalaya*t*a
pœmi*n*enneya, says Hîna*t*i-kumburê.

<span id="fn_473"></span>[201:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_476.md) This paragraph is
an excellent example of the difficulty of doing anything like justice in
translations to the most instructive and valuable passages in our
Buddhist texts. It is in the Pâli full of eloquence, and even in the
Si*m*halese, though there too much expanded, it is powerful and
striking. To a Buddhist it must have been inspiring and touching to the
last degree, carefully led up to, as it is, with masterly skill, by our
author. But it is so full of terms untranslateable into English, and
with difficulty even comprehensible to minds saturated with Western
ideas, that every translation must be inadequate, and any attempt to
reproduce the real beauty of its style must be a failure.

<span id="fn_474"></span>[201:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_477.md) How almost
impossible it is for a reader with pre-conceived delusions to grasp the
plain sense of such passages may be seen from the strange note which the
French translator has added at the end of this clear and eloquent
description. He says, 'La conclusion de ce Jâtaka (sic!) paraît être que
le dévot bouddhiste peut <span id="page_202">p. 202</span> atteindre
Nirvâna dans cette vie même. Il est fâcheux que l'auteur ne se soit pas
expliqué plus catégoriquement sur cette question intéressante' (!).

<span id="fn_475"></span>[202:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_478.md) Sannihita*m*
perhaps 'is situate.' Hîna*t*i-kumburê has pihi*t*iye, 'can be got.'

<span id="fn_476"></span>[202:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_479.md) I*kkh*itabbo. See
above, p. 269 of the Pâli.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[203:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_480.md) This is stated in
regard to each of the seven in the standard passage on these seven
treasures, translated in my 'Buddhist Suttas,' pp. 251-259.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[203:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_481.md) Sakâ.
Hîna*t*i-kumburê has sadly blundered over this, to him, strange word. He
actually translates it 'one's own.'

<span id="fn_479"></span>[204:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_482.md) Vilâta, the
Si*m*halese has Milâta.

<span id="fn_480"></span>[204:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_483.md) That is Alexandria
on the Indus. See the Introduction to the first part, p. xxiii.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[204:3](sbe3606.htm#fr_484.md) All these names are
discussed, ibid. pp. xliii, xliv.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[204:4](sbe3606.htm#fr_485.md) Naga-muddham.
Hîna*t*i-kumburê understands this as the top of Mount Meru, Sakka's
heaven.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[204:5](sbe3606.htm#fr_486.md) Brahma-loke.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[205:1](sbe3606.htm#fr_487.md) In the Si*m*halese,
pp. 472, 473, this last paragraph is much expanded.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[205:2](sbe3606.htm#fr_488.md) The Si*m*halese has
Sakala-*g*ana-mano-nandanîyawû me Srî-saddharmâdâsayehi a*t*aweni
wargaya nimiyeya.
