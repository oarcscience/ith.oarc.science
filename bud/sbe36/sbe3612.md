# BOOK VII. CHAPTER 4.

## THE SIMILES (continued).

### 31. THE WHITE ANT.

1\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that quality of the white ant which you say he
ought to have, which is it?'

'Just, O king, as the white ant goes on with his work only when he has
made a roof over himself, and covered himself up; just so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, on his round for alms,
cover up his mind with righteousness and self-restraint as a roof. For
in so doing, O king, will he have passed beyond all fear. This, O king,
is the one quality of the white ant he ought to have. \[**393**\] For it
was said, O king, by Upasena Va<u>n</u>gantaputta, the Elder:

"The devotee who covers up his mind,  
Under the sheltering roof of righteousness  
And self-control, untarnished by the world  
Remains, and is set free from every fear <span
id="fr_777"></span>[1](#fn_768)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 32. THE CAT.

2\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those two qualities of the cat you say he ought
to have, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the cat, in frequenting caves and holes and the
interiors of storied dwellings, does so only in the search after rats;
just so, O king, should

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, whether he have gone to the
village or to the woods or to the foot of trees or into an empty
house <span id="fr_778"></span>[1](#fn_769), be continually and always
zealous in the search after that which is his food, namely
self-possession. This is the first quality of the cat he ought to have.

3\. 'And again, O king, as the cat in pursuing its prey always crouches
down <span id="fr_779"></span>[2](#fn_770); just so, O king, should the
strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, continue conscious of the origin
and end <span id="fr_780"></span>[3](#fn_771) of those five groups of
the characteristic marks of individuality which arise out of clinging to
existence, thinking to himself: "Such is form, such is its origin, such
its end. Such is sensation, such is its origin, such its end. Such are
ideas, such is their origin, such their end. Such are the mental
potentialities (the Confections, Sa*m*khârâ), such is their origin, such
their end. Such is self-consciousness, such is its origin, such its
end <span id="fr_781"></span>[4](#fn_772)." This, O king, is the second
quality of the cat he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the
Blessed One, the god over all gods:

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

"Seek not rebirths afar in future states.  
Pray, what could heaven itself advantage you!  
Now, in this present world, and in the state  
In which you find yourselves, be conquerors!"'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 33. THE RAT.

4\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the rat you say he ought to
take, which is it?'

'Just, O king, as the rat, wandering about backwards and forwards, is
always smelling after food <span id="fr_782"></span>[1](#fn_773); just
so, O king, \[**394**\] should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort,
be ever in his wanderings to and fro, bent upon thought. This is the
quality of the rat he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Upasena
Va<u>n</u>ganta-putta, the Elder:

"Ever alert and calm, the man of insight,  
Esteeming wisdom as the best of all things,  
Keeps himself independent of all wants and cares <span
id="fr_783"></span>[2](#fn_774)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 34. THE SCORPION.

5\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the scorpion you say he
ought to take, which is it?'

'Just, O king, as the scorpion, whose tail is its weapon, keeps its tail
erect as it wanders about; just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort, have knowledge as his weapon,

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

and dwell with his weapon, knowledge, always drawn. This, O king, is the
quality of the scorpion he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by
Upasena Va<u>n</u>ganta-putta, the Elder:

"With his sword of knowledge drawn, the man of insight  
Should ever be unconquerable in the fight,  
Set free from every fear <span id="fr_784"></span>[1](#fn_775)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 35. THE MUNGOOSE.

6\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the mungoose you say he
ought to take, which is it?'

'Just, O king, as the mungoose, when attacking a snake, only does so
when he has covered his body with an antidote; just so, O king, should
the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when going into the world
where anger and hatred are rife, which is under the sway of quarrels,
strife, disputes, and enmities, ever keep his mind anointed with the
antidote of love. This, O king, is the quality of the mungoose he ought
to have. For it was said, O king, by Sâriputta, the Elder, the Commander
of the Faith:

"Therefore should love be felt for one's own kin,  
And so for strangers too, and the whole wide world  
Should be pervaded with a heart of love--  
This is the doctrine of the Buddhas all."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 36. THE OLD MALE JACKAL.

7\. \[**395**\] 'Venerable Nâgasena, the two qualities of the old male
jackal you say he ought to take, which are they?'

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

'Just, O king, as the old male jackal, whatever kind of food he finds,
feels no disgust, but eats of it as much as he requires; just so, O
king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, eat without
disgust such food as he receives with the sole object of keeping himself
alive. This, O king, is the first quality of the old male jackal he
ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Mahâ Kassapa, the Elder:

Leaving my dwelling-place, I entered once  
Upon my round for alms, the village street.  
A leper there I saw eating his meal,  
And, as was meet, deliberately, in turn,  
I stood beside him too that he might give a gift.  
He, with his hand all leprous and diseased,  
Put in my bowl--'twas all he had to give--  
A ball of rice; and as he placed it there  
A finger, mortifying, broke and fell.  
Seated behind a wall, that ball of food  
I ate, and neither when I ate it, nay,  
Nor afterwards, did any loathing thought  
Arise within my breast <span id="fr_785"></span>[1](#fn_776)."

8\. 'And again, O king, as the old male jackal, when he gets any food,
does not stop to examine it; just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never stop to find out whether food given to
him is bitter or sweet, well-flavoured or ill--just as it is should he
be satisfied with it. This, O king, is the second quality of the old
male jackal

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Upasena
Va<u>n</u>ganta-putta, the Elder:

"Bitter food too should he enjoy,  
Nor long for what is sweet to taste.  
The mind disturbed by lust of taste  
Can ne'er enjoy the ecstacies  
Of meditations high. The man content  
With anything that's given--in him alone  
Is Sama*n*aship made perfect <span id="fr_786"></span>[1](#fn_777)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 37. THE DEER.

9\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those three qualities of the deer you say he
ought to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the deer frequents the forest by day, and spends the
night in the open air; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu,
earnest in effort, pass the day in the forest, and the night under the
open sky. This, O king, is the first quality of the deer he ought to
have. \[**396**\] For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god
over all gods, in the exposition called the Lomaha*m*sana Pariyâya:

"And I, Sâriputta, when the nights are cold and wintry, at the time of
the eights (the Ash*t*akâ festivals <span
id="fr_787"></span>[2](#fn_778)), when the snow is falling, at such
times did I pass the night under the open sky, and the day in the woods.
And in the last month of the hot season I spent the day under the open
sky, and the night in the woods <span id="fr_788"></span>[3](#fn_779)."

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

10\. 'And again, O king, as the deer, when a javelin or an arrow is
falling upon him, dodges it and escapes, not allowing his body to remain
in its way; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, when evil inclinations fall upon him, dodge them, and escape,
placing not his mind in their way. This, O king, is the second quality
of the deer he ought to have.

11\. 'And again, O king, as the deer on catching sight of men escapes
this way or that, that they may not see him; just so, O king, should the
strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when he sees men of quarrelsome
habits, given to contentions and strife and disputes, wicked men and
inert, fond of society--then should he escape hither or thither that
neither should they see him, nor he them <span
id="fr_789"></span>[1](#fn_780). This, O king, is the third quality of
the deer he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Sâriputta, the
Elder, the Commander of the Faith:

"Let not the man with evil in his heart,  
Inert, bereft of zeal, of wicked life,  
Knowing but little of the sacred words--  
Let not that man, at any time or place,  
Be my companion, or associate with me <span
id="fr_790"></span>[2](#fn_781)."

 

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

### 38. THE BULL.

12\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those four qualities of the bull you say he
ought to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the bull never forsakes its own stall; just so, O
king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never abandon his
own body on the ground that its nature is only the decomposition, the
wearing away, the dissolution, the destruction of that which is
impermanent <span id="fr_791"></span>[1](#fn_782). This, O king, is the
first quality of the bull he ought to have.

13\. 'And again, O king, as the bull, when he has once taken the yoke
upon him, bears that yoke through all conditions of case or of pain;
just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort,
\[**397**\] when he has once taken upon himself the life of a recluse,
keep to it, in happiness or in woe, to the end of his life, to his
latest breath. This, O king, is the second quality of the bull he ought
to have.

14\. 'And again, O king, as the bull drinks water with never satiated
desire; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, receive the instruction of his teachers and masters with a
desire, love, and pleasure that is never satiated <span
id="fr_792"></span>[2](#fn_783). This, O king, is the third quality of
the bull he ought to have.

15\. 'And again, O king, as the bull equally bears the yoke whoever puts
it on him; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, accept with bowed head the admonitions and exhortations

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

of the elders, of the brethren of junior or of middle standing, and of
the believing laity alike. This, O king, is the fourth quality of the
bull he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Sâriputta, the Elder,
the Commander of the Faith:

"A novice, seven years of age, a boy  
Only to-day received into our ranks,  
He too may teach me, and with bended head,  
His admonitions will I gladly bear.  
Time after time, where'er I meet him, still  
My strong approval, and my love, will I  
Lavish upon him--if he be but good,--  
And yield the honoured place of teacher to him <span
id="fr_793"></span>[1](#fn_784)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 39. THE BOAR.

16\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those two qualities of the boar you say he
ought to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the boar, in the sultry and scorching weather of the
hot season, resorts to the water; just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when his heart is distracted and ready to
fall, all in a whirl, inflamed by anger, resort to the cool, ambrosial,
sweet water of the meditation on love. This, O king, is the first
quality of the boar he ought to have.

17\. 'And again, O king, as the boar, resorting to muddy water, digs
into the swamp with his snout, and making a trough for himself, lies
down therein; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, put his body away in his mind, and

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

lie down in the midst of contemplation. \[**398**\] This, O king, is the
second quality of the boar he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by
Pi*nd*ola Bhâradva*g*a, the Elder:

"Alone, with no one near, the man of insight,  
Searching into and finding out the nature  
Of this body, can lay him down to rest  
On the sweet bed of contemplations deep <span
id="fr_794"></span>[1](#fn_785)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 40. THE ELEPHANT.

18\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, the five qualities of the elephant he ought to
take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the elephant, as he walks about, crushes the earth;
just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort,
mastering the nature of the body, crush out all evil. This, O king, is
the first quality of the elephant he ought to have.

19\. 'And again, O king, as the elephant turns his whole body when he
looks, always looking straight before him, not glancing round this way
and that <span id="fr_795"></span>[2](#fn_786); just so, O king, should
the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, turn his whole body when he
looks, always looking straight before, not glancing round this way and
that, not looking aloft, not looking at his feet, but keeping his eyes
fixed about a yoke's length in front of him. This, O king, is the second
quality of the elephant he ought to have.

20\. 'And again, O king, as the elephant has no permanent lair, even in
seeking his food does not always frequent the same spot, has no fixed
place of

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

abode; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort,
have no permanent resting-place, but without a home should go his rounds
for alms. Full of insight, wherever he sees a pleasant suitable
agreeable place <span id="fr_796"></span>[1](#fn_787), whether in a hut
or at the foot of a tree, or in a cave, or on a mountain side, there
should he dwell, not taking up a fixed abode. This, O king, is the third
quality of the elephant he ought to have.

21\. 'And again, O king, as the elephant revels in the water, plunging
into glorious lotus ponds full of clear pure cool water, and
covered-over with lotuses yellow, and blue, and red, and white, sporting
there in the games in which the mighty beast delights; \[**399**\] just
so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, plunge into
the glorious pond of self-possession, covered with the flowers of
emancipation, filled with the delicious waters of the pure and stainless
clear and limpid Truth; there should he by knowledge shake off and drive
away the Sa*m*khâras <span id="fr_797"></span>[2](#fn_788), there should
he revel in the sport that is the delight of the recluse. This, O king,
is the fourth quality of the elephant he ought to have.

22\. 'And again, O king, as the elephant lifts up his foot with care,
and puts it down with care; just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be mindful and self-possessed in lifting

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

up his feet and in putting them down, in going or returning, in
stretching his arm or drawing it back,--wherever he is he should be
mindful and self-possessed. This, O king, is the fifth quality of the
elephant he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One,
the god over all gods, in the most excellent Sa*m*yutta Nikâya:

           "Good is restraint in action,  
           And good restraint in speech,  
           Good is restraint in mind,  
           Restraint throughout is good.  
           Well guarded is he said to be  
Who is ashamed of sin, in all things self-controlled <span
id="fr_798"></span>[1](#fn_789)."'

Here ends the Fourth Chapter.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_768"></span>[326:1](sbe3612.htm#fr_777) Not traced as yet.
But as it is doubtless an old verse it is interesting that it contains
the word yogî.

<span id="fn_769"></span>[327:1](sbe3612.htm#fr_778) Hammiyantara. The
Si*m*halese has Pi*t*a barânda œti u*d*u mahal prâsâda œtula*t*a giye
da. 'Barânda,' which is not in Clough, I take to be simply 'verandah,'
and the whole to mean: 'or goes into the interior of a mansion with an
upper story to it on which is a verandah.' Buddhaghosa on *K*ullavagga,
VI, 1, 2, (putting only kû*t*âgâra, 'peaked chamber,' for barânda,) has
the same explanation. Ten or twelve years is allowed in *K*ullavagga VI,
17, 1, for the building of such a prâsâda. See also Mahâvagga I, 30, 4,
and VI, 33, 2.

<span id="fn_770"></span>[327:2](sbe3612.htm#fr_779) Âsanne is Mr.
Trenckner's reading. But Hîna*t*i-kumburê, who translates deyat tabâ
hindîme*m* ma, 'sitting with its forepaws stretched out,' evidently read
âsanena.

<span id="fn_771"></span>[327:3](sbe3612.htm#fr_780) Abbaya, not in
Childers, is of course avyaya.

<span id="fn_772"></span>[327:4](sbe3612.htm#fr_781) The Simhalese
expands this speech over ten pages, 580-589, and then omits the verse at
the end.

<span id="fn_773"></span>[328:1](sbe3612.htm#fr_782) Upasi*m*sako. Dr.
Morris, in the 'Journal of the Pâli Text Society'(1884, p. 75), suggests
upasi<u>n</u>ghako. But the Si*m*halese in the first clause (p. 589,
last line) has patami*m* ma, 'hoping for, seeking for,' and in the
second (p. 590, line 2) pœtîme*m* ma, which is the same thing (from
prârthanâ, which confirms Mr. Trenckner's reading).

<span id="fn_774"></span>[328:2](sbe3612.htm#fr_783) Not traced as yet.

<span id="fn_775"></span>[329:1](sbe3612.htm#fr_784) Not traced as yet.

<span id="fn_776"></span>[330:1](sbe3612.htm#fr_785) Thera Gâthâ
1054-1056. The reading pakkena hatthena seems to me to be quite correct.
Compare pakka-gatto, also of a leper, at M. I, 506; and above, p. 357 of
the Pâli.

<span id="fn_777"></span>[331:1](sbe3612.htm#fr_786) Thera Gâthâ 580.

<span id="fn_778"></span>[331:2](sbe3612.htm#fr_787) So called because
they were held on the 8th day after the full moon in the two winter
months. See the notes in 'Vinaya Texts,' I, p. 130, and in the
Ma*ggh*ima, p. 536.

<span id="fn_779"></span>[331:3](sbe3612.htm#fr_788) Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya
I, p. 79. To quote this passage here as an authority the Bhikshu ought
still to follow, is a striking instance of <span id="page_332">p.
332</span> the fatal habit of quoting texts of Scripture apart from
their context. As it stands, it seems as if it supported the proposition
of our author. But it is really just the contrary. For it occurs in the
description given by Gotama of what he had done before he arrived at
insight, when he was carrying out that system of penance which he
afterwards abandoned as useless, and indeed worse than useless.

<span id="fn_780"></span>[332:1](sbe3612.htm#fr_789) See Ma*ggh*ima
Nikâya I, 79, where the closing words are the same.

<span id="fn_781"></span>[332:2](sbe3612.htm#fr_790) Thera Gâthâ 987
(but the last words differ).

<span id="fn_782"></span>[333:1](sbe3612.htm#fr_791) See Dîgha Nikâya
II, 83; *G*âtaka I, 146.

<span id="fn_783"></span>[333:2](sbe3612.htm#fr_792) Ghâyamânena,
at*ri*ptikawa âghrâ*n*aye*m* in the Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_784"></span>[334:1](sbe3612.htm#fr_793) Not traced as yet.
Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 594, takes santo in the sense of sat purusha
gu*n*aye*m* yukta wû.

<span id="fn_785"></span>[335:1](sbe3612.htm#fr_794) Not traced as yet.

<span id="fn_786"></span>[335:2](sbe3612.htm#fr_795) On this curious
belief, see 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 64.

<span id="fn_787"></span>[336:1](sbe3612.htm#fr_796) For dese bhava*m*
the Si*m*halese reads desa-bhâga.

<span id="fn_788"></span>[336:2](sbe3612.htm#fr_797) Sa*m*khâra is here
used in the sense in which they are said at Dhammapada, verse 203, to be
paramâ dukkhâ. The word is there explained by the commentator (wrongly,
I think) as the five Skandhas. The Si*m*halese, p. 596, simply has sarva
sa*m*skâra dharmaya*m*.

<span id="fn_789"></span>[337:1](sbe3612.htm#fr_798) From the Samyutta
III, 1, 5, 6. The first four lines are also included in the Dhammapada
collection, verse 361.
