# BOOK VII. CHAPTER 3.

## THE SIMILES (continued).

### 21. THE EARTH.

1\. \[**382**\] 'Venerable Nâgasena, those five qualities of the earth
which you say he ought to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the earth remains just the same whether one scatter
upon it desirable things or the reverse--whether camphor and aloes and
jasmine and sandal-wood and saffron, or whether bile and phlegm and pus
and blood and sweat and fat and saliva and mucus and the fluid which
lubricates the joints and urine and faeces--still it is the same; just
so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, remain the
same, unmoved at support or neglect, at fame or dishonour, at blame or
praise, in happiness or in woe. This, O king, is the first of the
qualities of the earth he ought to have.

2\. 'And again, O king, as the earth has no adornment, no garlands, but
is suffused with the odour of itself; just so, O king, should the
strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, wear no finery, but rather be set
round with the sweet savour of his own righteousness of life. This, O
king, is the second quality of the earth he ought to have.

3\. 'And again, O king, as the earth is solid, without holes or
interstices, thick, dense, and spreads itself out on every side; just
so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be endowed
with an unbroken righteousness of life with no gaps

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

or cracks in it, thick, dense, and spreading itself out on every side.
This, O king, is the third quality of the earth he ought to have.

4\. 'And again, O king, as the earth is never weary, though it bears up
the villages and towns and cities and countries, the trees and hills and
rivers and ponds and lakes, the wild creatures and birds and men,
multitudes of men and women; just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be never weary in giving exhortation and
admonition and instruction and education, in rousing and inciting and
gladdening, and at the expositions of the faith. This, O king, is the
fourth quality of the earth he ought to have.

5\. 'And again, O king, as the earth is free alike from fawning and from
ill-will <span id="fr_752"></span>[1](#fn_743); just so, O king, should
the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, continue in spirit, like the
earth, free alike from fawning upon any man, from ill-will to any man.
This is the fifth quality of the earth he ought to have. \[**383**\] For
it was said, O king, by the devoted woman, *K*ulla Subhaddâ, when she
was exalting the recluses of her own sect <span
id="fr_753"></span>[2](#fn_744):

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

Were one, enraged, to cut their one arm with an axe,  
Another, pleased, to anoint the other with sweet scent,  
No ill-will would they bear the one, nor love the other.  
Their hearts are like the earth, unmoved are my recluses <span
id="fr_754"></span>[1](#fn_745)."'

### 22. WATER.

6\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, the five qualities of water which you say he
ought to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as water is firmly fixed (in pools, wells, &c.), shakes
not, and (in its ordinary state) is not disturbed, and is pure by
nature; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, putting away hypocrisy, and whining, and intimating their wants,
and improper influences of all sorts, be fixed, unshaken, undisturbed,
and pure in nature. This, O king, is the first quality of water he ought
to have.

7\. 'And again, O king, as water is always of a refreshing nature; just
so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be full of
pity, and love, and kindness to all beings, seeking the good of all, in
mercy to all. This, O king, is the second quality of water he ought to
have.

8\. 'And again, O king, as water makes the dirty clean; just so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu,

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

earnest in effort, be in all places, whether in the village or in the
forest, free from disputes with, free from offence against his teachers,
his masters, or those standing towards him like a teacher. This, O king,
is the third quality of water he ought to have.

9\. 'And again, O king, as water is desired of all men; just so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, wishing for little,
content, given to solitude and retirement, be always an object of desire
to all the world. This, O king, is the fourth quality of water he ought
to have.

10\. 'And again, O king, as water works no harm to any man; just so, O
king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never do any
wrong, whether in deed or word or thought, which would produce in others
either strife, or quarrel, or contention, or dispute, or a feeling of
emptiness, or anger <span id="fr_755"></span>[1](#fn_746), or
discontent. \[**384**\] This, O king, is the fifth quality of water he
ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over
all gods, in the Ka*n*ha *G*âtaka <span id="fr_756"></span>[2](#fn_747):

"If you would grant a boon to me,  
O Sakka, lord of every creature,--  
Let none, Sakka, on my account,  
Be harmed, whether in mind or body,  
At any time or place. This, Sakka,  
This would I choose as boon of boons <span
id="fr_757"></span>[3](#fn_748)."'

 

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

### 23. FIRE.

11\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those five qualities of fire which you say he
ought to take, which are they?'

'just, O king, as fire burns grass, and sticks, and branches, and
leaves; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, burn out in the fire of wisdom all evil dispositions which feed
on objects of thought, whether subjective or objective, whether
desirable or the reverse. This, O king, is the first quality of fire he
ought to have.

12\. 'And again, O king, as fire has no pity, neither mercy; just so, O
king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, show no pity,
neither mercy, to any evil dispositions. This, O king, is the second
quality of fire he ought to have.

13\. 'And again, O king, as fire destroys cold; just so, O king, should
the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, lighting up in his heart the
burning fire of zeal, destroy all evil dispositions therein. This, O
king, is the third quality of fire he ought to have.

14\. 'And again, O king, as fire, seeking no favour of any man, bearing
no ill-will to any man, makes heat for all; just so, O king, should the
strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, dwell in spirit like the fire,
fawning on none, bearing ill-will to none. This, O king, is the fourth
quality of fire he ought to have.

15\. 'And again, O king, as fire dispels darkness, and makes the light
appear; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, dispel the

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

darkness of ignorance, and make the light of knowledge to appear. This
is the fifth quality of fire he ought to have. For it was said, O king,
by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in his exhortation to Râhula,
his son:

\[**385**\] "Practise thyself, Râhula, in that meditation which acts
like fire. Thereby shall no wrong dispositions, which have not yet
arisen, arise within thee, nor shall they that have arisen bear sway
over thy heart <span id="fr_758"></span>[1](#fn_749)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 24. WIND.

16\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those five qualities of wind which you say he
ought to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as wind pervades the spaces in the woods and groves in
flowering time; so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, rejoice in the groves of meditation that are all in blossom with
the sweet flowers of emancipation. This, O king, is the first quality of
wind he ought to have.

17\. 'And again, O king, as wind sets all the trees that grow upon the
earth in agitation, bends them

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

down; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort,
retiring into the midst of the woods, there examining into the true
nature of all existing things (all phenomena, Sa*m*khâras), beat down
all evil dispositions. This, O king, is the second quality of wind he
ought to have.

18\. 'And again, O king, as the wind wanders through the sky; just so, O
king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, accustom his mind
to wander among transcendental things. This is the third quality of wind
he ought to have.

19\. 'And again, O king, as wind carries perfume along; just so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, carry along with him
alway the fragrant perfume of his own righteousness of life. This, O
king, is the fourth quality of wind he ought to have.

20\. 'And again, O king, as wind has no house, no home to dwell in; just
so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, remain
alway without a house, without a home to dwell in, not addicted to
society, set free in mind. This, O king, is the fifth quality of wind he
ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over
all gods, in the Sutta Nipâta:

"In friendship of the world anxiety is born,  
In household life distraction's dust lies thick;  
The state set free from home and friendship's ties--  
That, and that only, is the recluse's aim <span
id="fr_759"></span>[1](#fn_750)."'

 

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

### 25. THE ROCK.

21\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, the five qualities of the rock that you say he
ought to have, which are they?'

\[**386**\] 'Just, O king, as rock is firm, unshaken, immoveable; just
so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never be
excited by alluring things--forms, or sounds, or scents, or tastes, or
touch--by veneration or contempt, by support or by neglect, by reverence
or its absence, by honour or dishonour, by praise or blame, nor should
he be offended by things that give offence, nor bewildered on occasions
of bewilderment, neither should he quake nor tremble, but like a rock
should he be firm. This, O king, is the first quality of the rock he
ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over
all gods:

"The solid rock's not shaken by the wind,  
Just so the wise man falters not, nor shakes,  
          At praise or blame <span id="fr_760"></span>[1](#fn_751)."

22\. 'And again, O king, as a rock is firm, unmixed with extraneous
things; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, be firm and independent, given to association with none. This, O
king, is the second quality of the rock he ought to have. For it was
said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods:

The man who mixes not with householders,  
Nor with the homeless, but who wanders lone,  
Without a home, and touched by few desires,--  
That is the man I call a Brâhma*n*a <span
id="fr_761"></span>[2](#fn_752)."

 

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

23\. 'And again, O king, as on the rock no seed will take root; just so,
O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never permit
evil dispositions to take root in his mind. This, O king, is the third
quality of rock that he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by
Subhûti, the Elder:

"When lustful thoughts arise within my heart,  
Examining myself, alone I beat them down.  
Thou who'rt by lust excited, who by things  
That give offence, allowest of offence,  
Feeling bewildered when strange things occur,  
Thou shouldst retire far from the lonely woods.  
For they're the dwelling-place of men made pure,  
Austere in life, free from the stains of sin.  
Defile not that pure place. Leave thou the woods <span
id="fr_762"></span>[1](#fn_753)."

24\. \[**387**\] 'And again, just as the rock rises aloft, just so
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, rise aloft through
knowledge. This is the fourth quality of the rock he ought to have. For
it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods:

When the wise man by earnestness has driven  
Vanity far away, the terraced heights  
Of wisdom doth he climb, and, free from care,  
Looks over the vain world, the careworn crowd--  
As he who standing on the mountain top  
Can watch his fellow-men still toiling on the plain <span
id="fr_763"></span>[2](#fn_754)."

25\. 'And again, O king, just as the rock cannot

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

be lifted up nor bent down; just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be neither lifted up nor depressed. This, O
king, is the fifth quality of the rock he ought to have. For it was
said, O king, by the devout woman, *K*ulla Subhaddâ, when she was
exalting the recluses of her own sect:

"The world is lifted up by gain, depressed by loss.  
My Sama*n*as remain alike in gain or loss."'

 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 26. SPACE.

26\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those five qualities of space which you say he
ought to have, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as space is everywhere impossible to grasp; just so, O
king, should it be impossible for the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, to be anywhere taken hold of by evil dispositions. This, O king,
is the first quality of space he ought to have.

27\. 'And again, O king, as space is the familiar resort of *R*ishis,
and ascetics, and gods <span id="fr_764"></span>[1](#fn_755), and flocks
of birds; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, make his mind wander easily over all things with the knowledge
that each individual (Sa*m*khâra) is impermanent, born to sorrow, and
without any abiding principle (any soul). This, O king, is the second
quality of space he ought to have.

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

28\. 'And again, O king, as space inspires terror; just so, O king
\[**388**\], should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, train his
mind to be in terror of rebirths in any kind of existence. To seek no
happiness therein. This, O king, is the third quality of space he ought
to have.

29\. 'And again, O king, as space is infinite, boundless, immeasurable;
just so, O king, should the righteousness of the strenuous Bhikshu,
earnest in effort, know no limit, and his knowledge be beyond measure.
This, O king, is the fourth quality of space he ought to have.

30\. 'And again, O king, as space does not hang on to anything, does not
cling to anything, does not rest on anything, is not stopped by
anything; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, neither in any way depend on, nor cling to, nor rest on, nor be
hindered by either the families that minister to him, or the pupils who
resort to him, or the support he receives, or the dwelling he occupies,
or any obstacles to the religious life, or any requisites that he may
want, or any kind of evil inclination. This, O king, is the fifth
quality of space he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the
Blessed One, the god over all gods, in his exhortation to Râhula, his
son:

"Just, Râhula, as space rests nowhere on anything, so shouldst thou
practise thyself in that meditation which is like space. Thereby shall
neither pleasant nor unpleasant sensations, as they severally arise,
bear sway over thy heart <span id="fr_765"></span>[1](#fn_756)."'

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

### 27. THE MOON.

31\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those five qualities of the moon which you say
he ought to have, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the moon, rising in the bright fortnight, waxes more
and more; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, grow more and more in good conduct and righteousness and virtue
and the constant performance of duty, and in knowledge of the scriptures
and study <span id="fr_766"></span>[1](#fn_757), and in the habit of
retirement, and in self-possession, and in keeping the doors of his
senses guarded, and in moderation in food, and in the practice of
vigils. This, O king, is the first quality of the moon he ought to have.

32\. 'And again, O king, as the moon is a mighty lord <span
id="fr_767"></span>[2](#fn_758); just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be a mighty lord over his own will.

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

well, or a mountain precipice, or a river in flood, would be abashed
alike in body and in mind; so be ye, O brethren, as the moon in your
visits to the laity. Holding alike in your outward demeanour and your
inward spirit, be ye alway, as strangers on their first visit, retiring
in the presence of the laity\] <span id="fr_770"></span>[1](#fn_761)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 28. THE SUN.

36\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, the seven qualities of the sun you say he
ought to have, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the sun evaporates all water; just so, O king, should
the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, cause all evil inclinations,
without any exception, to dry up within him. This, O king, is the first
quality of the sun he ought to have.

37\. 'And again, O king, as the sun dispels the darkness; just so, O
king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, dispel all the
darkness of lust, and of anger, and of dullness, and of pride, and of
heresy, and of evil, and of all unrighteousness. This, O king, is the
second quality of the sun he ought to have.

38\. 'And again, O king, as the sun is always in motion; just so, O
king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be ever
thoughtful. This,

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

\[paragraph continues\] O king, is the third quality of the sun he ought
to have.

39\. 'And again, O king, as the sun has a halo of rays; just so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, have a halo of
meditation. This, O king, is the fourth quality of the sun he ought to
have.

40\. 'And again, O king, as the sun continually warms multitudes of
people; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, rejoice the whole world of gods and men with good conduct, and
righteousness, and virtue \[**390**\], and the performance of duty, and
with the *Gh*ânas, and the Vimokkhas, and Samâdhi, and the Samâpattis
(various modes of transcendental meditation or ecstacy), and with the
five moral powers, and the seven kinds of wisdom, and the four modes of
being mindful and self-possessed, and the fourfold great struggle
against evil, and the pursuit of the four roads to saintship. This, O
king, is the fifth quality of the sun he ought to have.

41\. 'And again, O king, as the sun is terrified with the fear of Râhu
(the demon of eclipses); just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu,
earnest in effort, seeing how beings are entangled in the waste
wildernesses of evil life and rebirth in states of woe, caught in the
net of the mournful results here of evil done in former births, or of
punishment in purgatory, or of evil inclinations, terrify his mind with
a great anxiety and fear. This, O king, is the sixth quality of the sun
he ought to have.

42\. 'And again, O king, as the sun makes manifest the evil and the
good; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort,
make manifest

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

the moral powers, and the kinds of wisdom, and the modes of being
mindful and self-possessed, and the struggle against evil, and the paths
to saintship, and all qualities temporal and spiritual. This, O king, is
the seventh quality of the sun he ought to have. For it was said, O
king, by Va<u>n</u>gîsa, the Elder:

"As the rising sun makes plain to all that live  
Forms pure and impure, forms both good and bad,  
So should the Bhikshu, like the rising orb,  
Bearing the scriptures ever in his mind,  
Make manifest to men, in ignorance blind,  
The many-sided Noble Path of bliss <span
id="fr_771"></span>[1](#fn_762)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 29. SAKKA.

43\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, the three qualities of Sakka (the king of the
gods) which you say he ought to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as Sakka enjoys perfect bliss; just so, O king, should
the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, rejoice in the perfect bliss
of retirement. This, O king, is the first quality of Sakka he ought to
have.

44\. 'And again, O king, as when Sakka when he sees his gods around him
keeps them in his favour, fills them with joy; just so, O king, should
the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, keep his mind detached, alert,
and tranquil, should make joy spring up within him, should rouse
himself, exert himself, be full of zeal. \[**391**\] This, O king is the
second quality of Sakka he ought to have.

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

45\. 'And again, O king, as Sakka feels no discontent; just so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never allow himself to
become discontented with solitude. This, O king, is the third quality of
Sakka he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Subhûti, the Elder:

"Since I, great hero, have renounced the world,  
According to the doctrine that you teach,  
I will not grant that any thought of lust  
Or craving care has risen in my breast <span
id="fr_772"></span>[1](#fn_763)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 30. THE SOVRAN OVERLORD.

46\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, the four qualities of the sovran overlord
which you say he ought to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the sovran overlord gains the favour of the people by
the four elements of popularity (liberality, affability, justice, and
impartiality); just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, find favour with, please, and gladden the hearts of the brethren
and rulers of the Order and the laity of either sex. This, O king, is
the quality of the sovran overlord he ought to have.

47\. 'And again, O king, as the sovran overlord allows no robber bands
to form in his realm; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu,
earnest in effort, never allow lustful or angry or cruel ideas to arise
within him. This, O king, is the second quality of the sovran overlord
he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god
over all gods:

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

"The man who takes delight in the suppression  
Of evil thoughts, and alway self-possessed,  
Reflects on the impurity of things  
The world thinks beautiful, he will remove--  
Nay, cleave in twain, the bonds of the Evil One <span
id="fr_773"></span>[1](#fn_764)."

48\. 'And again, O king, as the sovran overlord travels through <span
id="fr_774"></span>[2](#fn_765) the whole world even to its ocean
boundary, examining into the evil and the good; just so, O king, should
the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, examine himself day by day as
to his acts and words and thoughts, saying to himself: "How may I pass
the day blameless in these three directions?" This, O king, \[**392**\]
is the third quality of the sovran overlord he ought to have. For it was
said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the most
excellent Ekuttara Nikâya:

"With constant care should the recluse  
Himself examine day by day--  
'As days and nights pass quickly by  
How have they found me? and how left <span
id="fr_775"></span>[3](#fn_766)?'"

 

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

49\. 'And again, O king, as the sovran overlord is completely provided
with protection, both within and without; just so, O king, should the
strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, keep self-possession as his
door-keeper for a protection against all evil, subjective and objective.
This, O king, is the fourth quality of the sovran overlord he ought to
have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all
gods:

"With self-possession as his door-keeper, O brethren, the disciple of
the noble ones puts away evil and devotes himself to goodness, puts away
what is matter of offence and devotes himself to blamelessness,
preserves himself in purity of life <span
id="fr_776"></span>[1](#fn_767)."'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_743"></span>[308:1](sbe3611.htm#fr_752) This simile has
already occurred above, I, 258, 259 (of the translation).

<span id="fn_744"></span>[308:2](sbe3611.htm#fr_753) The Si*m*halese
(pp. 563, 564) gives the whole story. She was the daughter of
Anâthapi*nd*ika (Sudatta), the famous supporter of the Buddha, and
builder of the *G*etavana at Sâvatthi. On her marriage to a rich
merchant at Sâketa (Audh) named Kâlaka, he invited the Brahman naked
ascetics of his sect, the Â*g*îvakas, and asked her to go and entertain
'the Arahats.' Hearing the word Arahat she went quickly and full of
delight to do so; and was shocked beyond measure to find a number of
disorderly fakirs, with neither modesty in their hearts, nor decency in
their outward behaviour. So she fled from the hall, and on her husband
remonstrating, was indignant. He then asked her what the recluses <span
id="page_309">p. 309</span> of her sect were like, and she told him.
Another verse from her description is quoted below, p. 387 of the Pâli.
The above story has been often repeated.

<span id="fn_745"></span>[309:1](sbe3611.htm#fr_754) Not traced.
Hîna*t*i-kumburê reads eka*ñ* *k*e bâha*m* (twice) and mânaso, pamodito;
and he is no doubt right.

which Hîna*t*i-kumburê renders siswa kipîma.

<span id="fn_747"></span>[310:2](sbe3611.htm#fr_756) These words are in
the original ascribed, not to the Buddha himself, but to Ka*n*ha-kumâro,
the then Bodisat.

Professor Fausböll reads ma*m* kate, but the Si*m*halese (pp. 566, 567)
confirms Mr. Trenckner's reading, ma*m* kâna, ma*m* nissâya, ma*m*
anattha-kâmatâya.

<span id="fn_749"></span>[312:1](sbe3611.htm#fr_758) Not traced as yet
exactly in these words. But the passage at Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya I, 424,
lines 3-6, agrees with it throughout, except that for akusalâ dhammâ
here we have there manapâ-manâpa phassâ, which comes to much the same
thing. As the words are there addressed to Râhula, and as our passage
here is introduced with the same formula as the quotation below (p. 388
of the Pâli) which is certainly taken from the same page of the
Ma*ggh*ima, I think the above (M. I, 424, lines 3-6) is most probably
the passage our author now intended to quote. If so, we have here a real
case of difference in reading.

<span id="fn_750"></span>[313:1](sbe3611.htm#fr_759) Sutta Nipâta I, 12,
1. It has been already quoted above, IV, 5, 1 (p. 211 of the Pâli),
where see the note.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[314:1](sbe3611.htm#fr_760) Dhammapada 81. The
first line recurs at Mahâvagga V, 1, 27.

<span id="fn_752"></span>[314:2](sbe3611.htm#fr_761) From the Sutta
Nipâta III, 9, 35. It is also included in the Dhammapada collection of
Scripture verses (No. 404).

<span id="fn_753"></span>[315:1](sbe3611.htm#fr_762) Not traced as yet.

<span id="fn_754"></span>[315:2](sbe3611.htm#fr_763) This verse, not
traced elsewhere as yet, is included in the Dhammapada collection as
verse 28.

<span id="fn_755"></span>[316:1](sbe3611.htm#fr_764) Bhûta, which the
Si*m*halese, p. 572, renders yaksha. I think it means all kinds of gods
(except the highest), demigods, fairies, superhuman beings, &c.

<span id="fn_756"></span>[317:1](sbe3611.htm#fr_765) Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya
I, 424. See the note above on VII, 3, 15.

<span id="fn_757"></span>[318:1](sbe3611.htm#fr_766) Âgamâdhigame. These
are two, not one. Âgama adhigama dekhi da says the Si*m*halese, p. 573.

<span id="fn_758"></span>[318:2](sbe3611.htm#fr_767) U*l*ârâdhipati. Dr.
Morris in the 'Journal of the Pâli Text Society' (1880, p. 107)
ingeniously proposes to read u*l*urâgâdhipati, 'king and lord over the
u*l*u's, the lunar mansions! In that case the u*l*âra in the latter
clause of the sentence would be a play upon words. But Mr. Trenckner's
reading is confirmed by the Si*m*halese, which has *k*andra diwya-râ*g*a
tema mahatwû sisira-gu*n*aye*m* adhipati wûyeya, 'the moon, that
heavenly king, is a lord by reason of his great coldness.' And the
reading may well stand, for the mention, in the latter part of the
clause, of the thing over which the Bhikshu is to be lord does not
necessarily require a corresponding word in the first part. We have
numerous instances in these similes of the ethical interpretation of the
physical simile being an addition, with nothing corresponding to it in
the type discussed. The moon was a god, lord over other things besides
the lunar mansions.

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

This, O king, is the second quality of the moon he ought to have.

33\. 'And again, O king, as the moon wanders at night; just so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be given to solitude.
\[**389**\] This, O king, is the third quality of the moon he ought to
have.

34\. 'And again, O king, as the moon hoists a standard over his
mansion <span id="fr_768"></span>[1](#fn_759); just so, O king, should
the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, hoist the standard of
righteousness. This, O king, is the fourth quality of the moon he ought
to have.

35\. 'And again, O king, as the moon rises when begged and prayed to do
so; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort,
frequent for alms those families who have asked and invited him to do
so <span id="fr_769"></span>[2](#fn_760). This, O king, is the fifth
quality of the moon he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the
Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the most excellent Samyutta,
Nikâya:

"Like the moon, O brethren, let your visits be paid to the laity.
Drawing back alike in outward demeanour and in inward spirit, be ye
always, as strangers on their first visit, retiring in the presence of
the laity. \[As the man who looks down a deep

<span id="fn_759"></span>[319:1](sbe3611.htm#fr_768) *K*ando
vimâna-ketu. 'Has his mansion, forty-nine yo*g*anas in extent, as his
banner,' says Hîna*t*i-kumburê. (A yo*g*ana is seven miles.) Vimâna does
not mean lunar mansion, but the palace which every deity, and therefore
also the moon, is supposed to inhabit.

<span id="fn_760"></span>[319:2](sbe3611.htm#fr_769) The Si*m*halese, p.
573, has the exact opposite. 'As the moon rises whether begged to do so
or not, so should the Bhikshu visit the laity whether invited to do so
or not.' But the Pâli must be right, as the subsequent quotation shows.

<span id="fn_761"></span>[320:1](sbe3611.htm#fr_770) Samyutta, XVI, 3,
2, 3. The sentence in brackets is added from Hîna*t*i-kumburê, who gives
here, p. 274, the Pâli text. Apakassa, the gerund of ava-karsh, and
naviyâ, 'new-comers,' are only found in this passage. In three cases M.
Léon Feer has here gone wrong, as he has so often elsewhere done, by
putting the readings of the Si*m*halese MSS. only in the notes, and
adopting the Burmese readings in the text. He should have read, as
Hîna*t*i-kumburê does, ni*kk*am naviyâ . . . . . . gambhîrûdapâna*m*, .
. . . . . nadî-dugga*m*.

<span id="fn_763"></span>[323:1](sbe3611.htm#fr_772) Not traced as yet.

<span id="fn_764"></span>[324:1](sbe3611.htm#fr_773) This verse has not
been elsewhere traced as yet, but is included in the Dhammapada
collection, verse 350. Vitakka, which, in accord with the context and
with Hîna*t*i-kumburê, is rendered above 'evil thoughts,' and by
Professor Max Müller 'doubts,' really means simply 'thoughts,' and is
sometimes used without any bad connotation. In the Pâli the word Mâru,
which spoils the metre, may possibly be an ancient gloss introduced by
mistake into the text.

<span id="fn_765"></span>[324:2](sbe3611.htm#fr_774) Anuyâyati, which is
only found here, and which the Si*m*halese, p. 577, renders anu*s*âsanâ
karanneya. But compare ânuyâyin at Sutta Nipâta V, 7, 3-5, and Tela
Ka*t*aha Gâthâ 25, anuyâyin above, p. 284 of the Pâli, and ânuyâto at
Tela Ka*t*âha Gâthâ 41.

<span id="fn_766"></span>[324:3](sbe3611.htm#fr_775) Mr. Trenckner
points out that this passage is taken from the A<u>n</u>guttara X, 5, 8.
Hîna*t*i-kumburê, who gives the Pâli, prints it as verse, and translates
the context at some length.

<span id="fn_767"></span>[325:1](sbe3611.htm#fr_776) Not traced as yet,
but the same phrase from 'puts away evil' to the end occurs at *G*âtaka
I, 130, 131.
