# BOOK VII. CHAPTER 5.

## THE SIMILES (continued).

### \[400\] 41. THE LION.

1\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those seven qualities of the lion you say he
ought to have, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the lion is of a clear, stainless, and pure light
yellow colour; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, be clear, stainless, and pure light in mind, free from anger and
moroseness. This, O king, is the first quality of the lion he ought to
have.

2\. 'And again, O king, as the lion has four paws as his means of
travelling, and is rapid in his gait; just so, O king, should the
strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, move along the four paths of
saintship. This, O king, is the second quality of the lion he ought to
have.

3\. 'And again, O king, as the lion has a beautiful coat of hair,
pleasant to behold; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu,
earnest in effort, have a beautiful coat of righteousness, pleasant to
behold. This, O king, is the third quality of the lion he ought to have.

4\. 'And again, O king, as the lion, even were his life to cease, bows
down before no man; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu,
earnest in effort, even though he should cease to obtain all the
requisites of a recluse--food and clothing and lodging and medicine for
the sick--never bow down

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

to any man <span id="fr_799"></span>[1](#fn_790.md). This is the fourth
quality of the lion he ought to have.

5\. 'And again, O king, as the lion eats regularly on, wheresoever his
prey falls there does he eat whatever he requires, and seeks not out the
best morsels of flesh; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu,
earnest in effort, stand for alms at each hut in regular order, not
seeking out the families where he would be given better food, not
missing out any house upon his rounds <span
id="fr_800"></span>[2](#fn_791.md), he should not pick and choose in
eating, wheresoever he may have received a mouthful of rice there should
he eat it, seeking not for the best morsels. This, O king, is the fifth
quality of the lion he ought to have.

6\. 'And again, O king, as the lion is not a storer up of what he eats,
and when he has once eaten of his prey returns not again to it; just so,
O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never be a
storer up of food. This is the sixth quality of the lion he ought to
have.

7\. \[**401**\] 'And again, O king, as the lion, even if he gets no
food, is not alarmed, and if he does <span
id="fr_801"></span>[3](#fn_792.md), then he eats it without craving,
without faintness, without sinking <span
id="fr_802"></span>[4](#fn_793.md); just so, O king, should the

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be not alarmed even if he gets no
food, and if he does then should he eat it without craving, without
faintness, without sinking, conscious of the danger in the lust of
taste, in full knowledge of the right outcome of eating (the maintenance
of life for the pursuit of holiness) <span
id="fr_803"></span>[1](#fn_794.md). This, O king, is the seventh quality of
the lion he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One,
the god over all gods, in the most excellent Samyutta Nikâya, when he
was exalting Mahâ Kassapa, the Elder:

"This Kassapa, O Bhikshus, is content with such food as he receives, he
magnifies the being content with whatever food one gets, he is not
guilty of anything improper or unbecoming for the sake of an alms, if he
receive none, yet is he not alarmed, and if he does then does he eat it
without craving, without faintness, without sinking, conscious of
danger, with full knowledge of the right object in taking food <span
id="fr_804"></span>[2](#fn_795.md)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 42. THE *K*AKRAVÂKA BIRD.

8\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those three qualities of the *K*akravâka bird
you say he ought to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the *K*akravâka bird never forsakes his mate even to
the close of his life; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu,
never, even

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

to the close of his life, give up the habit of thought. This, O king, is
the first quality of the *K*akravâka bird he ought to have.

9\. 'And again, O king, as the *K*akravâka bird feeds on the Sevâla and
Pa*n*aka (water-plants so called), and derives satisfaction therefrom,
and being so satisfied, neither his strength nor his beauty grows less;
just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, find
satisfaction in whatever he receives. And if he does so find
satisfaction, O king, then does he decrease neither in power of
meditation, nor in wisdom, nor in emancipation, nor in the insight that
arises from the consciousness of emancipation, nor in any kind of
goodness. \[**402**\] This, O king, is the second quality of the
*K*akravâka bird he ought to have.

10\. 'And again, O king, as the *K*akravâka bird does no harm to living
things; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, laying aside the cudgel, laying aside the sword, be full of
modesty and pity, compassionate and kind to all creatures that have
life <span id="fr_805"></span>[1](#fn_796.md). This, O king, is the third
quality of the *K*akravâka bird he ought to have. For it was said, O
king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the *K*akravâka
*G*âtaka:

"The man who kills not, nor destroys,  
Oppresses not, nor causes other men  
To take from men that which is rightly theirs <span
id="fr_806"></span>[2](#fn_797.md)--- <span id="page_342">p. 342</span>  
And this from kindness to all things that live--  
No wrath with any man disturbs his peace <span
id="fr_807"></span>[1](#fn_798.md)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 43. THE PE*N*ÂHIKÂ <span id="fr_808"></span>[2](#fn_799.md) BIRD.

11\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those two qualities of the Pe*n*âhikâ bird you
say he ought to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the Pe*n*âhikâ bird, through jealousy of her mate,
refuses to nourish her young <span id="fr_809"></span>[3](#fn_800.md); just
so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be jealous
of any evil dispositions

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

which arise within him, and putting them by his mindfulness into the
excellent crevice of self-control, should dwell at the door of his mind
in the constant practice of self-possession in all things relating to
his body <span id="fr_810"></span>[1](#fn_801.md). This, O king, is the
first quality of the Pe*n*âhikâ bird he ought to have.

12\. 'And again, O king, as the Pe*n*âhikâ bird spends the day in the
forest in search of food, but at night time resorts for protection to
the flock of birds to which she belongs; just so, O king, should the
strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, who has for a time resorted to
solitary places for the purpose of emancipation from the ten Fetters,
and found no satisfaction therein, repair back to the Order for
protection against the danger of blame, and dwell under the shelter of
the Order <span id="fr_811"></span>[2](#fn_802.md). This, O king, is the
second quality of the Pe*n*âhikâ bird he ought to have. For it was said,
O king, by the Brahmâ Sahampati in the presence of the Blessed One:

"Seek lodgings distant from the haunts of men,  
Live there in freedom from the bonds of sin;  
But he who finds no peace in solitude  
May with the Order dwell, guarded in heart,  
Mindful and self-possessed <span id="fr_812"></span>[3](#fn_803.md)."'

 

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

### 44. THE HOUSE-PIGEON.

13\. \[**403**\] 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the
house-pigeon you say he ought to take, which is it?'

'Just, O king, as the house-pigeon, while dwelling in the abode of
others, of men, does not become enamoured of anything that belongs to
them, but remains neutral, taking notice only of things pertaining to
birds; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort,
while resorting to other people's houses, never become enamoured of
women or of men, of beds, or chairs, or garments, or jewelry, or things
for use or enjoyment, or various forms of food that are there, but
remain neutral always, addicted only to such ideas as become a recluse.
This, O king, is the quality of the house-pigeon he ought to have. For
it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the
*K*ulla *N*ânada *G*âtaka:

"Frequenting people's homes for food or drink,  
In food and drink alike be temperate,  
And let not beauty's form attract thy thoughts <span
id="fr_813"></span>[1](#fn_804.md)"'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 45. THE OWL.

14\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those two qualities of the owl you say he
ought to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the owl, being at enmity with the crows, goes at night
where the flocks of crows are, and kills numbers of them; just so, O
king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

at enmity with ignorance; seated alone and in secret, he should crush it
out of existence, cut it off at the root. This, O king, is the first
quality of the owl he ought to have.

15\. 'And again, O king, as the owl is a solitary bird; just so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be devoted to solitude,
take delight in solitude. This, O king, is the second quality of the owl
he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god
over all gods, in the most excellent Sa*m*yutta Nikâya:

"Let the Bhikshu, my brethren, be devoted to solitude, take delight in
solitude, to the end that he may realise what sorrow really is, and what
the origin of sorrow really is, \[**404**\] and what the cessation of
sorrow really is, and what the path that leads to the cessation of
sorrow really is <span id="fr_814"></span>[1](#fn_805.md)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 46. THE INDIAN CRANE <span id="fr_815"></span>[2](#fn_806.md).

16\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the Indian crane you say
he ought to take, which is it?'

'Just, O king, as the Indian crane by its cry makes known to other folk
the good fortune or disaster that is about to happen to them; just so, O
king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, make known to
others by his preaching of the Dhamma how dreadful a state is purgatory,
and how blissful is Nirvâ*n*a. This, O king, is the quality of the
Indian crane he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Pi*nd*ola
Bhâra-dvâ*g*a, the elder:

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

"Two matters there are that the earnest recluse  
Should ever to others be making clear--  
How fearful, how terrible, purgatory is;  
How great and how deep is Nirvâ*n*a's bliss <span
id="fr_816"></span>[1](#fn_807.md) ."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 47. THE BAT.

17\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those two qualities of the bat you say he
ought to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the bat, though it enters into men's dwelling-places,
and flies about in them, soon goes out from them, delays not therein;
just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when
he has entered the village for alms, and gone on his rounds in regular
order, depart quickly with the alms he has received, and delay not
therein. This, O king, is the first quality of the bat he ought to have.

18\. 'And again, O king, as the bat, while frequenting other folk's
houses, does them no harm; just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when visiting the houses of the laity, never
give them cause for vexation by persistent requests, or by pointing out
what he wants, or by wrong demeanour, or by chattering, or by being
indifferent to their prosperity or adversity; he should never take them
away from their chief business occupations, but desire their success in
all things. This, O king, is the second quality of the bat he ought to
have. For it was said, O king, \[**405**\] by the Blessed One, the god
over all gods, in the Lakkhana Suttanta:

'"Oh! How may others never suffer loss  
Or diminution, whether in their faith,<span id="page_347">p.
347</span>  
Or righteousness, or knowledge of the word,  
Or understanding, or self-sacrifice,  
Or in religion, or in all good things,  
Or in their stores of wealth, or corn, or lands,  
Or tenements, or in their sons, or wives,  
Or in their flocks and herds, or in their friends,  
And relatives, and kinsmen, or in strength,  
In beauty, and in joy'--'tis thus he thinks--  
Longing for other men's advantage and success <span
id="fr_817"></span>[1](#fn_808.md)!"'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 48. THE LEECH.

19\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the leech which you say he
ought to take, which is it?'

'Just, O king, as the leech, wheresoever it is put on, there does it
adhere firmly, drinking the blood; just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort, on whatsoever subject for meditation he may
fix his mind, call that subject firmly up before him in respect of its
colour, and shape, and position, and extension, and boundaries, and
nature, and characteristic marks, drinking the delicious draught of the
ambrosia of emancipation. This, O king, is the quality of the leech he
ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Anuruddha, the Elder:

"With heart made pure, in meditation firm,  
Drink deep of freedom's never-failing draught <span
id="fr_818"></span>[2](#fn_809.md)."'

 

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

### 49. THE SERPENT.

20\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those three qualities of the serpent you say
he ought to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the serpent progresses by means of its belly; just so,
O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, progress by
means of his knowledge. For the heart of the recluse, O king, who
progresses by knowledge, continues in perception (of the four Truths),
that which is inconsistent with the characteristics of a recluse <span
id="fr_819"></span>[1](#fn_810.md) does he put away, that which is
consistent with them does he develop in himself. This, \[**406**\] O
king, is the first quality of the serpent he ought to have.

21\. 'And again, O king, just as the serpent as it moves avoids
drugs <span id="fr_820"></span>[2](#fn_811.md); just so, O king, should the
strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, go on his way avoiding
unrighteousness. This, O king, is the second quality of the serpent he
ought to have.

22\. 'And again, O king, as the serpent on catching sight of men is
anxious, and pained, and seeks a way of escape <span
id="fr_821"></span>[3](#fn_812.md); just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when he finds himself thinking wrong
thoughts, or discontent arising within him, be anxious and pained, and
seek a way of escape, saying to himself: "This day must I have spent in
carelessness, and never shall I be able to recover it." This, O king, is
the third quality of the

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

serpent he ought to have. For it is a saying, O king, of the two fairy
birds in the Bhallâ*t*iya *G*âtaka:

"'Tis one night only, hunter, that we've spent  
Away from home, and that against our will,  
And thinking all night through of one another,  
Yet that one night is it that we bemoan,  
And grieve; for nevermore can it return <span
id="fr_822"></span>[1](#fn_813.md)!"'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 50. THE ROCK-SNAKE <span id="fr_823"></span>[2](#fn_814.md).

23\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the rock-snake that you
say he ought to take, which is it?'

'Just, O king, as the rock-snake, immense as is its length of body, will
go many days with empty belly, and, wretched get no food to fill its
stomach, yet in spite of that it will just manage to keep itself alive;
just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, though
he be addicted to obtaining his food by alms, dependent on the gifts
that others may give, awaiting offers, abstaining from taking anything
himself, and find it difficult to get his belly's-full, yet should he,
if he seek after the highest good <span id="fr_824"></span>[3](#fn_815.md),
even though he receive not so much as four or five mouthfuls to eat,
fill up the void by water. This, O king, is the quality of the
rock-snake he ought to have. For it was said, O king, \[**407**\] by
Sâriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

"Whether it be dry food or wet he eats,  
Let him to full repletion never eat.  
The good recluse goes forth in emptiness,  
And keeps to moderation in his food.  
If but four mouthfuls or but five he get,  
Let him drink water. For what cares the man  
With mind on Arahatship fixed for ease <span
id="fr_825"></span>[1](#fn_816.md)!"'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here ends the Fifth Chapter.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_790"></span>[339:1](sbe3613.htm#fr_799.md) This is. an
injunction the Bhikshus still observe. Some of them have been known to
attend a levée in Ceylon (improperly, as I venture to think). But as
they would bow to no one, not to governor or prince, the levée became,
so far as they were concerned, a mere march-past.

<span id="fn_791"></span>[339:2](sbe3613.htm#fr_800.md) This is one of the
Dhuta<u>n</u>gas, and is in the Sekhiyas (No. 33). Most Bhikshus never
'stand for alms' at all. But if they do, they observe this rule.

<span id="fn_792"></span>[339:3](sbe3613.htm#fr_801.md)' If he does not,'
says the Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_793"></span>[339:4](sbe3613.htm#fr_802.md) Ana*ggh*âpanno. The
MSS. in parallel passages (Tevigga 1, 27; A<u>n</u>guttara II, 5, 7;
III, 131; Udâna VII, 3, 10; Ma*ggh*ima I, <span id="page_340">p.
340</span>173; Suma<u>n</u>gala I, 59) have usually a*ggh*opanno. The
Si*m*halese has âhâra t*ri*sh*n*âwehi no gœlî.

<span id="fn_794"></span>[340:1](sbe3613.htm#fr_803.md)
Nissara*n*a-pa*ññ*ena. This Hîna*t*i-kumburê renders nissara*n*âkhyâtawû
brahma*k*ariyânugraha pi*n*isa yanâdiwû pratyawekshâ *ñ*â*n*aye*m*
yuktawû.

<span id="fn_795"></span>[340:2](sbe3613.htm#fr_804.md) Sa*m*yutta XVI, 1,
3 (vol. ii, p. 194 Of M. Léon Feer's edition for the Pâli Text Society).

<span id="fn_796"></span>[341:1](sbe3613.htm#fr_805.md) This is from the
first clause in the *K*ûla Sîla (translated in 'Buddhist Suttas,' p.
189).

<span id="fn_797"></span>[341:2](sbe3613.htm#fr_806.md) Na *g*inâti na
*g*âpaye. Both these forms are to be derived, I venture to think, from
*G*YÂ (or its more primitive form *G*Î), and not from *G*I. It is true
that Childers gives *g*inâti as third person singular of *G*I, and that
(through the influence of the <span id="page_342">p. 342</span> common
word *G*ina) there has really, perhaps, been some confusion in Pâli
writers between the two roots, closely allied as they are both in form
and meaning. But whether or not that be so elsewhere, we have here at
least another instance of the frequent association of a simple verb with
its own causal. *G*âpeti, which occurs three times in the Milinda, and
is always explained by Hîna*t*i-kumburê in the same way (see my notes
above on pp. 171, 227 of the Pâli; here he has artha-hâni no karawâ da),
i neither for *gh*âpeti (as Dr. Edward Müller suggests in his grammar,
p. 37) nor for *g*âpayati, but for *g*yâpayati. For the apparent
confusion between *G*I, *g*ayati, 'conquer,' and *G*YÂ, ginâti, (1)
'overcome, bring into subjection,' (2) 'oppress, extort,' see the
commentary on *g*ine at Dhammapada, verse 103 (quoted also at *G*âtaka
I, 314), which runs *g*initvâna *g*aya*m* âhareyya; and on gaya*m* at
Verse 201 (taken from Samyutta III, 2, 4, 7), which is explained by
*g*inanto, and at verse 104 where *g*ita*m* is explained by *g*inâti.
But in Pi*t*aka texts I know of no instance where the two roots cannot
be kept quite distinct; and it is quite possible that the Dhammapada
commentator, while interpreting the one root by the other, is still
conscious of the difference between them. *G*îna (the p. p. p. of
*g*inâti) is not given at all by Childers, but occurs *G*âtaka III, 153,
223, 335; V, 99.

<span id="fn_798"></span>[342:1](sbe3613.htm#fr_807.md) *G*âtaka IV, 71.
One word differs, and the lines are not spoken by the Buddha, but by the
bird.

<span id="fn_799"></span>[342:2](sbe3613.htm#fr_808.md) The Si*m*halese (p.
600) has kœndœttiya, a word not in Clough.

<span id="fn_800"></span>[342:3](sbe3613.htm#fr_809.md) Hîna*t*i-kumburê's
translation of this clause shows that he had a different reading in his
Pâli text.

<span id="fn_801"></span>[343:1](sbe3613.htm#fr_810.md) 'As the Pe*n*âhikâ,
refusing to nourish her young in the nest, puts them into a crevice of a
tree, and watches them there,' is the Si*m*halese interpretation. And
the word susira would not have been used in the second clause unless
something corresponding to it had originally stood also in the first.

<span id="fn_802"></span>[343:2](sbe3613.htm#fr_811.md) Here again it is
probable from the Si*m*halese version that Hîna*t*i-kumburê reads
ratti*m* for rati*m*.

<span id="fn_803"></span>[343:3](sbe3613.htm#fr_812.md) The verse occurs in
the Thera Gâthâ 142, but is here quoted from the Samyutta Nikâya VI, 2,
3, 4, where the readings sa*k*e *k*a . . . . . nâdhiga*kkh*aye . . . . .
satimâ must be corrected according to the readings here.

<span id="fn_804"></span>[344:1](sbe3613.htm#fr_813.md) *G*âtaka IV, 223.
There is a difference of reading, making no difference to the sense; and
the words are put into the mouth, not of the Buddha, but of the old
ascetic, the Bodisat of the story.

<span id="fn_805"></span>[345:1](sbe3613.htm#fr_814.md) Not traced as yet.

<span id="fn_806"></span>[345:2](sbe3613.htm#fr_815.md) Satapatto,
literally the hundred-feathered one,' Si*m*halese kœrœl, quite different
from the ordinary crane (bako), This one was a bird of ill omen. See
*G*âtaka II, 153 foll.

<span id="fn_807"></span>[346:1](sbe3613.htm#fr_816.md) Not traced as yet.

<span id="fn_808"></span>[347:1](sbe3613.htm#fr_817.md) This is from the
30th Sutta in the Dîgha Nikâya, where it occurs in the description of
the Bodisat.

<span id="fn_809"></span>[347:2](sbe3613.htm#fr_818.md) Not traced as yet.
Childers translates ase*k*ana by 'charming,' &c., apparently on the
authority of Subhûti's English gloss on Abhidhâna Padîpikâ 597. But that
meaning is rather the point of union between all the synonyms given in
the verse, and not the exact meaning of each of them. The word, either
in its simple form, or with an added -ka, occurs in Therâ Gâthâ 55;
Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya I, 114.

<span id="fn_810"></span>[348:1](sbe3613.htm#fr_819.md) Vilakkha*n*a*m*,
not found elsewhere. Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 604, renders it simply
'dullness' (moha).

<span id="fn_811"></span>[348:2](sbe3613.htm#fr_820.md) 'Goes slanting,
avoiding medicinal plants, trees, &c.,' says the Si*m*halese.
