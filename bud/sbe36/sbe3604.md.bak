# BOOK IV. CHAPTER 6.

\[DILEMMA THE FIFTY-FIRST.  
CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS AS TO THE BUDDHA'S TEACHER.\]

1\. \[**235**\] 'Venerable Nâgasena, this too has been said by the
Blessed One:

"I have no teacher, and the man  
Equal to me does not exist.  
No rival to me can be found  
In the whole world of gods and men <span
id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_121.md)."

'But on the other hand he said:

"Thus then, O brethren, Â*l*âra Kâlâma, when he was my teacher and I was
his pupil, placed me on an equality with himself, and honoured me with
exceeding great honour <span id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_122.md)."

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

'Now if the former of these statements be right, then the second must be
wrong. But if the second be right, then the first must be wrong. This
too is a double-edged problem, now put to you, which you have to solve.'

2\. 'Both the quotations you have made, O king, are accurate. But when
he spoke of Â*l*âra Kâlâma as his teacher, that was a statement made
with reference to the fact of his having been his teacher while he
(Gotama) was still a Bodisat and before he had attained to insight and
to Buddhahood; and there were five such teachers, O king, under whose
tuition the Bodisat spent his time in various places--his teachers when
he was still a Bodisat, before he had attained to insight and to
Buddhahood. And who were these five?

3\. 'Those eight Brahmans who, just after the birth of the Bodisat, took
note of the marks on his body--\[**236**\] Râma, and Dha*g*a, and
Lakkha*n*a, and Mantî <span id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_123.md), and
Ya*ññ*a <span id="fr_126"></span>[2](#fn_124.md), and Suyâma, and
Subho*g*a <span id="fr_127"></span>[3](#fn_125.md), and Sudatta <span
id="fr_128"></span>[4](#fn_126.md)--they who then made known his future
glory, and marked him out as one to be carefully guarded-these were
first his teachers <span id="fr_129"></span>[5](#fn_127.md).

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

'And again, O king, the Brahman Sabbamitta of distinguished descent, who
was of high lineage in the land of Udi*kk*a <span
id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_128.md), a philologist and grammarian, well read
in the six Veda<u>n</u>gas <span id="fr_131"></span>[2](#fn_129.md), whom
Suddhodana the king, the Bodisat's father, sent for, and having poured
out the water of dedication from a golden vase, handed over the boy to
his charge, to be taught--this was his second teacher <span
id="fr_132"></span>[3](#fn_130.md).

'And again, O king, the god who raised the agitation in the Bodisat's
heart, at the sound of whose speech the Bodisat, moved and anxious, that
very moment went out from the world in his Great Renunciation--this was
his third teacher <span id="fr_133"></span>[4](#fn_131.md).

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

'And again, O king, Â*l*âra Kâlâma--he was his fourth teacher.

'And again, O king, Uddaka the son of Râma--he was his fifth teacher.

'These, O king, are the five who were his teachers when he was still a
Bodisat, before he had attained to insight and to Buddhahood. But they
were teachers in worldly wisdom. And in this Doctrine that is
transcendental, in the penetrating into the wisdom of the omniscient
ones--in that there is no one who is above the Tathâgata to teach him.
Self-dependent for his knowledge is the Tathâgata, without a master, and
that is why it was said by the Tathâgata:

"I have no teacher, and the man  
Equal to me does not exist.  
No rival to me can be found  
In the whole world of gods and men."'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma as to the Buddha's teachers.\]

 

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

\[DILEMMA THE FIFTY-SECOND.  
WHY MUST THERE BE ONLY ONE BUDDHA AT A TIME?\]

4\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, this too was said by the Blessed One:

"This is an impossibility, an occurrence for which there can be no
cause, that in one world two Arahat Buddhas supreme should arise at one
and the same time \[**237**\]--such a thing can in no wise be <span
id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_132.md)."

'But, Nâgasena, when they are preaching, all the Tathâgatas preach (the
Doctrine as to) the thirty-seven constituent elements of insight <span
id="fr_135"></span>[2](#fn_133.md); when they are talking, it is of the
Four Noble Truths that they talk; when they are instructing, it is in
the three Trainings <span id="fr_136"></span>[3](#fn_134.md) that they
instruct; when they are teaching, it is the practice of zeal <span
id="fr_137"></span>[4](#fn_135.md) that they teach. If, Nâgasena, the
preaching of all the Tathâgatas is one, and their talk of the same
thing, and their training the same, and their teaching one, why then
should not two Tathâgatas arise at the same time? Already by the
appearance of one Buddha has this world become flooded with light. If
there should be a second Buddha the world would be still more
illuminated by the glory of them both. When they were exhorting two
Tathâgatas would exhort at ease; when they were instructing two
Tathâgatas would instruct at ease. Tell me the reason of this, that I
may put away my doubt.'

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

5\. 'This world system, O king, is a one-Buddha-supporting world; that
is, it can bear the virtue of only a single Tathâgata. If a second
Tathâgata were to arise the world could not bear him, it would shake and
tremble, it would bend, this way and that, it would disperse, scatter
into pieces, dissolve, be utterly destroyed. just as a boat, O king,
might be able to carry one passenger across. Then, when one man had got
on board, it would be well trimmed and able to bear his weight <span
id="fr_138"></span>[1](#fn_136.md). But if a second man were to come like
to the first in age and caste and strength and size and stoutness of
body and build of frame, and he too should get on board the boat--would
that boat be able, O king, to carry them both?

'Certainly not, Sir! it would shake and tremble; it would bend, this way
and that; it would break into pieces, be shattered, dissolved, and
utterly destroyed; it would sink into the waves.'

'Just so, O king, with this world, if a second Tathâgata were to appear.
Or suppose, O king, that a man \[**238**\] had eaten as much food as he
wanted, even so that he had filled himself with nourishment up to the
throat, and he--thus satiated <span id="fr_139"></span>[2](#fn_137.md),
regaled, filled with good cheer, with no room left for more, drowsy and
stiff as a stick one cannot bend--were again to eat as much food as he
had eaten before--would such a man, O king, then be at ease?'

'Certainly not, Sir! If he were to eat again, but once more, he would
die.'

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

'Well, no more could this world bear a second Tathâgata, than that man
could bear a second meal.'

6\. 'But how is that, Nâgasena? Would the earth tremble at a too great
weight of goodness?'

'Suppose, O king, there were two carts quite filled with precious things
up to the top <span id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_138.md), and people were to
take the things from the one cart and pile them up on the other, would
that one be able to carry the weight of both?'

'Certainly not, Sir! The nave of its wheels would split, and the spokes
would break, and the circumference would fall to pieces, and the
axle-tree would break in twain <span id="fr_141"></span>[2](#fn_139.md).'

'But how is that, O king? Would the cart come to pieces owing to the too
great weight of goods?'

'Yes, it would.'

7\. 'Well, just so, O king, would the earth tremble owing to the too
great weight of goodness. But that argument has been adduced to make the
power of the Buddhas known <span id="fr_142"></span>[3](#fn_140.md). Hear
another fitting reason why two Buddhas could not appear at the same

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

time. If, O king, two Buddhas were to arise together, then would
disputes arise between their followers, and at the words: "Your Buddha,
our Buddha," they would divide off into two parties--just as would the
followers of two rival powerful ministers of state. This is the other
\[**239**\] reason, O king, why two Buddhas could not appear at the same
time.

8\. 'Hear a further reason, O king, why two Buddhas could not appear at
the same time. If that were so, then the passage (of Scripture) that the
Buddha is the chief would become false, and the passage that the Buddha
takes precedence of all would become false, and the passage that the
Buddha is the best of all would become false. And so all those passages
where the Buddha is said to be the most excellent, the most exalted, the
highest of all, the peerless one, without an equal, the matchless one,
who hath neither counterpart nor rival--all would be proved false.
Accept this reason too as in truth a reason why two Buddhas cannot arise
at once.

9\. 'But besides that, O king, this is a natural characteristic of the
Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, that one Buddha only should arise in the
world. And why? By reason of the greatness of the virtue of the
all-knowing Buddhas. Of other things also, whatever is mighty in the
world is singular. The broad earth is great, O king, and it is only one.
The ocean is mighty, and it is only one. Sineru, the king of the
mountains, is great; and it is only one. Space is mighty, and it is only
one. Sakka (the king of the gods) is great, and he is only one. Mara
(the Evil One, Death) is great, and he is only one. Mahâ-Brahmâ is
mighty, and he is only one.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

\[paragraph continues\] A Tathâgata, an Arahat Buddha supreme, is great,
and he is alone in the world. Wherever any one of these spring up, then
there is no room for a second. And therefore, O king, is it that only
one Tathâgata, an Arahat Buddha supreme, can appear at one time in the
world.'

'Well has the puzzle, Nâgasena, been discussed by simile adduced and
reason given. Even an unintelligent man on hearing this would be
satisfied; how much rather one great in wisdom as myself. Very good,
Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.

\[Here ends the dilemma as to why there should be only one Buddha at a
time in the world.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[DILEMMA THE FIFTY-THIRD.  
WHY SHOULD GIFTS BE GIVEN TO THE ORDER RATHER THAN TO THE BUDDHA?\]

\[**240**\] 10. 'Venerable Nâgasena, the Blessed One said to his
mother's sister  <span id="fr_143"></span>[1](#fn_141.md), Mahâ-Pa*g*âpatî
the Gotamî, when she was about to give him a cloth wrapper for use in
the rainy season <span id="fr_144"></span>[2](#fn_142.md):

"Give it, O Gotamâ, to the Order. If the Order is presented by you with
it, then will you have paid homage: thereby alike to the Order and to
me <span id="fr_145"></span>[3](#fn_143.md)."

'But what, Nâgasena? Is not the Tathâgata of

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

greater weight and importance, and more worthy of gifts than even the
jewel treasure of the Order, that the Tathâgata should have told his
aunt, when about to present him with a wrapper for the rainy season
which she herself had carded and pressed and beaten and cut and
woven <span id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_144.md), to give it to the Order!
If, Nâgasena, the Tathâgata were really higher and greater and more
excellent than the Order, then he would have known that a gift given to
him would be most meritorious, and therefore would not have told her to
give it to the Order. But inasmuch as the Tathâgata, Nâgasena, puts
himself not in the way of gifts to himself, gives no occasion for such
gifts, you see that he then told his aunt to give that wrapper rather to
the Order.'

11\. 'The quotation you make, O king, is correct, and the Blessed One
did so direct his aunt's gifts <span id="fr_147"></span>[2](#fn_145.md).
But that was not because an act of reverence paid to himself would bear
no fruit, or because he was unworthy to receive gifts, but it was out of
kindness and mercy that he, thinking: "Thus will the Order in times to
come, when I am gone, be highly thought of;" magnified the excellence
which the Order really had, in that he said: "Give it, O Gotamî, to the
Order. If you present the Order with it, thus will you have paid homage
alike to the Order and to me." Just as a father, O king, while he is yet
alive, exalts in the midst of the assembly of ministers, soldiers, and
royal messengers, of

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

sentries, body guards, and courtiers <span
id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_146.md)--yea, in the presence of the king
himself--the virtues which his son really possesses, thinking: "If
established here he will be honoured of the people in times to come;" so
was it out of mercy and kindness that the Tathâgata, thinking: "Thus
will the Order, in times to come, when I am gone, be highly thought of;"
magnified the excellence which the Order really had, in that he said:
"Give it, O Gotamî, to the Order. If you present the Order with it, thus
will you have paid homage alike to the Order and to me."

12\. \[**241**\] 'And by the mere gift of a wrapper for the rainy
season, the Order, O king, did not become greater than, or superior to,
the Tathâgata. just, O king, as when parents anoint their children with
perfumes, rub them, bathe them, or shampoo them <span
id="fr_149"></span>[2](#fn_147.md), does the son by that mere service of
theirs become greater than, or superior to, his parents?'

'Certainly not, sir! Parents deal with their children as they will,
whether the children like it or not <span
id="fr_150"></span>[3](#fn_148.md). And therefore do they anoint them with
perfumes, shampoo, or bathe them.'

'And just so, O king, the Order did not become greater than, or superior
to, the Tathâgata merely by the fact of that gift; and although the
Tathâgata, whether the Order liked it or not, told his aunt to give the
wrapper to the Order.

13\. 'Or suppose, O king, some man should bring a complimentary present
to a king, and the king should present that gift to some one else--to a
soldier or a

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

messenger, to a general or a chaplain,--would that man become greater
than, or superior to, the king, merely by the fact that it was he who
got the present <span id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_149.md)?'

'Certainly not, Sir! That man receives his wage from the king, from the
king he gains his livelihood; it was the king who, having placed him in
that office, gave him the present.'

'And just so, O king, the Order did not become greater than, or superior
to, the Tathâgata merely by the fact of that gift. The Order is, as it
were, the hired servant of the Tathâgata, and gains its livelihood
through the Tathâgata. And it was the Tathâgata who, having placed it in
that position, caused the gift to be given it.

14\. 'And further the Tathâgata, O king, thought thus: "The Order is by
its very nature worthy of gifts. I will therefore have this thing, my
property though it be, presented to it," and so he had the wrapper given
to the Order. For the Tathâgata, O king, magnifies not the offering of
gifts to himself, but rather to whomsoever in the world is worthy of
having gifts presented to him. For this was said, O king, by the Blessed
One, the god over all gods, in the most excellent Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya,
\[242\] in the religious discourse entitled Dhamma-dâyâda, when he was
exalting the attainment of being content with little:

"He would become the first of my Bhikkhus, the most worthy of presents
and of praise <span id="fr_152"></span>[2](#fn_150.md)."

15\. 'And there is not, O king, in the three worlds

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

any being whatever more worthy of gifts, greater or more exalted or
better, than the Tathâgata. It is the Tathâgata who was greatest and
highest and best. As it was said, O king, by Mâ*n*ava-gâmika the god, in
the most excellent Samyutta Nikâya, as he stood before the Blessed One
in the midst of the assembly of gods and men:

Of all the Râ*g*agaha hills Mount Vipula's acknowledged chief,  
Of the Himalayas Mount White, of planetary orbs the sun,  
The ocean of all waters, of constellations bright the moon <span
id="fr_153"></span>[1](#fn_151.md)--  
In all the world of gods and men the Buddha's the acknowledged
Lord <span id="fr_154"></span>[2](#fn_152.md)!"

And those verses of Mâ*n*ava the god, O king, were well sung, not
wrongly sung, well spoken, not wrongly spoken, and approved by the
Blessed One <span id="fr_155"></span>[3](#fn_153.md). And was it not said
by Sâriputta, the Commander of the faith:

"There is but one Confession, one true Faith,  
One Adoration of clasped hands stretched forth  
--That paid to Him who routs the Evil One,  
And helps us cross the ocean of our ills <span
id="fr_156"></span>[4](#fn_154.md)!"

 

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

'And it was said by the Blessed One himself, the god over all gods:

"There is one being, O brethren, who is born into the world for the good
and for the weal of the great multitudes, out of mercy to the world, for
the advantage and the good and the weal of gods and men. And what is
that being? A Tathâgata, an Arahat Buddha supreme <span
id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_155.md)."'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma as to the precedence of the Order over the
Buddha.\] \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[DILEMMA THE FIFTY-FOURTH.  
IS IT MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO BE A LAYMAN, OR TO ENTER THE ORDER?\]

16\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, it was said by the Blessed One:

"I would magnify, O brethren, the Supreme Attainment <span
id="fr_158"></span>[2](#fn_156.md) either in a layman or in a recluse.
Whether he be a layman., O brethren, or a recluse, the man who has
reached the Supreme Attainment

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

shall overcome all the difficulties inherent therein, shall win his way
even to the excellent condition of Arahatship <span
id="fr_159"></span>[1](#fn_157.md)." \[**243**\]

'Now, Nâgasena, if a layman, clad in white robes, enjoying the pleasures
of sense, dwelling in a habitation encumbered with wife and
children <span id="fr_160"></span>[2](#fn_158.md), making constant use of
the sandal wood of Benares <span id="fr_161"></span>[3](#fn_159.md), of
garlands and perfumes and unguents, accepting gold and silver, wearing a
turban inlaid with jewels and gold, can, having reached the Supreme
Attainment, win his way to the excellent condition of Arahatship--and if
a recluse, with his shaven head and yellow robes, dependent for his
livelihood on the alms of other men, perfectly fulfilling the fourfold
code of morality <span id="fr_162"></span>[4](#fn_160.md), taking upon
himself and carrying out the hundred and fifty precepts <span
id="fr_163"></span>[5](#fn_161.md), conducting

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

himself according to the thirteen extra vows <span
id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_162.md) without omitting any one of them, can
also, having reached the Supreme Attainment, win his way to the
excellent condition of Arahatship--then, Sir, what is the distinction
between the layman and the recluse? Your austerity is without effect,
your renunciation is useless, your observance of the precepts is barren,
your taking of the extra vows is vain. What is the good of your therein
heaping up woes to yourselves, if thus in comfort the condition of bliss
can be reached?'

17\. 'The words you ascribe to the Blessed One, O king, are rightly
quoted. And that is even so. It is the man who has reached to the
Supreme Attainment who bears the palm. If the recluse, O king, because
he knows that he is a recluse, should neglect the Attainments, then is
he far from the fruits of renunciation, far from Arahatship--how much
more if a layman, still wearing the habit of the world, should do so!
But whether he be a layman, O king, or a recluse, he who attains to the
supreme insight, to the supreme conduct of life, he too will win his way
to the excellent condition of Arahatship.

18\. 'But nevertheless, O king, it is the recluse who is the lord and
master of the fruit of renunciation. And renunciation of the world, O
king, is full of gain, many and immeasurable are its advantages, its
profit can no man calculate. just, O king, as no man can put a measure,
in wealth, on the

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

value of a wish-conferring gem, \[**244**\] Saying: "Such and such is
the price of the gem"--just so, O king, is the renunciation of the world
full of gain, many and immeasurable are its advantages, its profit can
no man calculate--no more, O king, than he could count the number of the
waves in the great ocean, and say: "So and so many are the waves in the
sea!"

19\. 'Whatsoever the recluse, O king, may have yet to do, all that doth
he accomplish straightway, without delay. And why is that? The recluse,
O king, is content with little, joyful in heart, detached from the
world, apart from society, earnest in zeal, without a home, without a
dwelling-place, righteous in conduct, in action without guile, skilled
in duty and in the attainments--that is why whatsoever may lie before
him yet to do, that can he accomplish straightway, without delay--just
as, the flight of your javelin <span id="fr_165"></span>[1](#fn_163.md), O
king, is rapid because it is of pure metal, smooth, and burnished, and
straight, and without a stain.'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma as to the recluse having no advantages over the
layman.\]

 

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

\[DILEMMA THE FIFTY-FIFTH.  
ASCETICISM.\]

20\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, when the Bodisat was practising
austerity <span id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_164.md), then there was found no
other exertion the like of his, no such power, no such battling against
evil, no such putting to rout of the armies of the Evil One, no such
abstinence in food, no such austerity of life. But finding no
satisfaction in strife like that, he abandoned that idea, saying:

"Not even by this cruel asceticism am I reaching the peculiar faculty,
beyond the power of man, arising from insight into the knowledge of that
which is fit and noble <span id="fr_167"></span>[2](#fn_165.md). May there
not be now some other way to wisdom <span
id="fr_168"></span>[3](#fn_166.md)?"

'But then, when weary of that path he had by another way attained to
omniscience, he, on the other hand, thus again exhorted and instructed
his disciple in that path (he had left, saying):

\[245\] "Exert yourselves, be strong, and to the faith  
The Buddhas taught devote yourselves with zeal.  
As a strong elephant a house of reeds,  
Shake down the armies of the Evil One <span
id="fr_169"></span>[4](#fn_167.md).

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

'Now what, Nâgasena, is the reason that the Tathâgata exhorted and led
his disciples to that path which he had himself abandoned, which he
loathed?'

21\. 'Both then also, O king, and now too, that is still the only path.
And it is along that path that the Bodisat attained to Buddhahood.
Although the Bodisat, O king, exerting himself strenuously, reduced the
food he took till he had decreased it to nothing at all <span
id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_168.md), and by that disuse of food he became
weak in mind, yet when he returned little by little to the use of solid
food, it was by that path that before long he attained to Buddhahood.
And that only has been the path along which all the Tathâgatas reached
to the attainment of the insight of omniscience. Just as food is the
support of all beings, as it is in dependence on food that all beings
live at ease, just so is that the path of all the Tathâgatas to the
attainment of the insight of omniscience. The fault was not, O king, in
the exertion, was not in the power, not in the battle waged against
evil, that the Tathâgata did not then, at once, attain to Buddhahood.
But the fault was in the disuse of food, and the path itself (of
austerity) was always ready for use.

22\. 'Suppose, O king, that a man should follow a path in great haste,
and by that haste his sides

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

should give way <span id="fr_171"></span>[1](#fn_169.md), or he should fall
a cripple on the ground, unable to move, would there then be any fault,
O king, in the broad earth that that man's sides had given way?'

'Certainly not, Sir! The great earth is always ready. How should it be
in fault? The fault was in the man's own zeal which made him fail.'

'And just even so, O king, the fault was not in the exertion, not in the
power, not in the battle waged against evil, that the Tathâgata did not
then, at once, attain to Buddhahood. But the fault was in the disuse of
food, and the path itself was always ready--\[**246**\] just as if a man
should wear a robe, and never have it washed, the fault would not be in
the water, which would always be ready for use, but in the man himself.
That is why the Tathâgata exhorted and led his disciples along that very
path. For that path, O king, is always ready, always right.'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

\[DILEMMA THE FIFTY-SIXTH.  
THE BACKSLIDERS.\]

23\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, this doctrine of the Tathâgatas is mighty,
essentially true, precious, excellent, noble, peerless, pure and
stainless, clear and faultless. It is not right to admit a layman who is
merely a disciple <span id="fr_172"></span>[1](#fn_170.md) into the Order.
He should be instructed as a layman still, till he have attained to the
Fruit of the First Path <span id="fr_173"></span>[2](#fn_171.md), and then
be admitted. And why is this? When these men, still being evil, have
been admitted into a religion so pure, they give it up, and return again
to the lower state <span id="fr_174"></span>[3](#fn_172.md), and by their
backsliding the people is led to think: "Vain must be this religion of
the Sama*n*a Gotama, which these men have given up." This is the reason
for what I say.'

24\. 'Suppose, O king, there were a bathing tank <span
id="fr_175"></span>[4](#fn_173.md), full of pure clear cold water. And some
man, dirty, covered with stains and mud, should come there, and without
bathing in it should turn back again, still dirty as before. Now in that
matter whom would the people blame, the dirty man, or the bathing tank?'

'The dirty man, Sir, would the people blame,

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

saying: "This fellow came to the bathing tank, and has gone back as
dirty as before. How could the bathing tank, of itself, cleanse a man
who did not care to bathe? What fault is there in the tank?"'

'Just so, O king, \[**247**\] has the Tathâgata constructed a bathing
tank full of the excellent waters of emancipation <span
id="fr_176"></span>[1](#fn_174.md),--the bath of the good law. Whosoever of
conscious discerning beings are polluted with the stains of sin, they,
bathing in it, can wash away all their sins. And if any one, having gone
to that bathing tank of the good law, should not bathe in it, but turn
back polluted as before, and return again to the lower state, it is him
the people would blame, and say: "This man entered religion according to
the doctrine of the Conquerors, and finding no resting-place within it,
has returned again to the lower state. How could the religion of the
Conquerors, of itself, cleanse him who would not regulate his life in
accordance with it? What fault is there in the system?"

25\. 'Or suppose, O king, that a man afflicted with dire disease should
visit a physician skilled in diagnosis <span
id="fr_177"></span>[2](#fn_175.md), knowing an efficacious and lasting
method of cure, and that that man should then not let himself be
treated, but go back again as ill as before. Now therein whom would the
people blame, the sick man or the doctor?'

It is the sick man, Sir, they would blame, saying:

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "How could the physician, of himself, cure this
man, who would not let himself be treated? What fault is there in the
doctor?"'

'Just so, O king, has the Tathâgata deposited in the casket of his
religion the ambrosial medicine (of Nirvâ*n*a) which is able to entirely
suppress all the sickness of sin, thinking: "May all those of conscious
sentient beings who are afflicted with the sickness of sin drink of this
ambrosia, and so allay all their disease." And if any one, without
drinking the ambrosia, should turn back again with the evil still within
him, and return once more to the lower state, it is he whom the people
will blame, saying: "This man entered religion according to the doctrine
of the Conquerors, and finding no resting-place within it, has returned
again to the lower state. How could the religion of the Conquerors, of
itself, cure him who would not regulate his life in accordance with it?
What fault is there in the system?"

 <span id="fr_178"></span>[1](#fn_176.md)26. 'Or suppose, O king, a
starving man were to attend at a place where a mighty largesse of
food <span id="fr_179"></span>[2](#fn_177.md) given for charity was being
distributed, and then should go away again, still starving, without
eating anything. Whom then would the people blame, the starving man, or
the feast of piety?'

'It is the starving man, Sir, they would blame, saying: \[**248**\]
"This fellow, though tormented with hunger, still when the feast of
piety was provided for him, partook of nothing, and went back as hungry
as before. How could the meal, of which he

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

would not eat, enter, of itself, into his mouth? What fault is there in
the food? "'

'Just so, O king, has the Tathâgata placed the most excellent, good,
auspicious, delicate ambrosial food, surpassing sweet, of the
realisation of the impermanency of all things <span
id="fr_180"></span>[1](#fn_178.md), into the casket of his religion,
thinking: "May all those of conscious sentient beings who feel within
them the torment of sin <span id="fr_181"></span>[2](#fn_179.md), whose
hearts are deadened by cravings, feeding upon this food, allay every
longing that they have for future life in any form, in any world." And
if any one, without enjoying this food, should turn back, still
dominated by his cravings, and return once more to the lower state, it
is he whom the people will blame, saying: "This man entered religion
according to the doctrine of the Conquerors, and finding no
resting-place within it, has returned again to the lower state. How
could the religion of the Conquerors, of itself, purify him who would
not regulate his life in accordance with it? What fault is there in the
system?"'

27\. 'If the Tathâgata, O king, had let a householder be received into
the Order only after he had been trained in the first stage of the
Excellent Way, then would renunciation of the world no longer indeed be
said to avail for the putting away of evil qualities, for purification
of heart--then would there be no longer any use in renunciation. It
would be as if a man were to have a bathing tank excavated

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

by the labour of hundreds (of workpeople <span
id="fr_182"></span>[1](#fn_180).md), and were then to have a public
announcement made: "Let no one who is dirty go down into this tank! Let
only those whose dust and dirt have been washed away, who are purified
and stainless, go down into this tank!" Now would that bath, O king, be
of any use to those thus purified and stainless?

'Certainly not, Sir! The advantage they would have sought in going into
the bath they would have already gained elsewhere. Of what use would the
bath be to them then?'

'Just so, O king, had the Tathâgata ordained that only laymen who had
already entered the first stage of the Excellent Way should be received
into the Order, then would the advantage they seek in it have been
already gained. Of what use would the renunciation be to them then?

28\. 'Or suppose, O king, that a physician, a true follower of the sages
of old <span id="fr_183"></span>[2](#fn_181.md), one who carries (in his
memory) the ancient traditions and verses <span
id="fr_184"></span>[3](#fn_182.md), a practical man <span
id="fr_185"></span>[4](#fn_183.md), skilled in diagnosis, and master of an
efficacious and lasting system of treatment, who had collected (from
medicinal herbs) a medicine able to cure every disease, were to have it
announced: \[**249**\] "Let none, Sirs, who are ill come to visit me!
Let the

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

healthy and the strong visit me!" Now, would then, O king, those men
free from illness and disease, healthy and jubilant, get what they
wanted from that physician?'

'Certainly not, Sir! What men want from a physician, that would they
have already obtained otherwise. What use would the physician be to
them?'

'Just so, O king, had the Tathâgata ordained that only those laymen who
had already entered the first stage of the Excellent Way should be
received into the Order, then would the advantages they seek in it have
been already gained elsewhere. Of what use would the renunciation be to
them then?

29\. 'Or suppose, O king, that some had had many hundreds of dishes of
boiled milk-rice prepared <span id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_184.md), and
were to have it announced to those about him: 'Let not, Sirs, any hungry
man approach to this feast of charity. Let those who have well fed, the
satisfied, refreshed, and satiated <span
id="fr_187"></span>[2](#fn_185.md), those who have regaled themselves, and
are filled with good cheer,--let them come to the feast." Now would any
advantage, O king, be derived from the feast by those men thus well fed,
satisfied, refreshed, satiated, regaled, and filled with good cheer?'

'Certainly not, Sir! The very advantage they would seek in going to the
feast, that would they have already attained elsewhere. What good would
the feast be to them?'

'Just so, O king, had the Tathâgata, ordained that

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

only those laymen who had already entered the first stage of the
Excellent Way should be received into the Order, thus would the
advantages they seek in it have been already gained elsewhere. Of what
use would the renunciation be to them?

30\. 'But notwithstanding that, O king, they who return to the lower
state manifest thereby five immeasurably good qualities in the religion
of the Conquerors. And what are the five? They show how glorious is the
state (which those have reached who have entered the Order), how
purified it is from every stain, how impossible it is for the sinful to
dwell within it together (with the good), how difficult it is to realise
(its glory), how many are the restraints to be observed within it.

31\. 'And how do they show the mighty glory of that state? just, O king,
as if a man, poor, and of low birth, without distinction <span
id="fr_188"></span>[1](#fn_186.md), deficient in wisdom, were to come into
possession of a great and mighty kingdom, it would not be long before he
would be overthrown, utterly destroyed <span
id="fr_189"></span>[2](#fn_187.md), and deprived of his glory. For he would
be unable to support his dignity. \[**250**\] And why so? Because of the
greatness thereof. just so is it, O king, that whosoever are without
distinction, have acquired no merit, and are devoid of wisdom, when they
renounce the world according to the religion of the Conquerors, then,
unable to bear that most excellent renunciation, overthrown, fallen, and
deprived of their glory, they return to the lower state. For they are
unable to

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

carry out the doctrine of the Conquerors. And why so? Because of the
exalted nature of the condition which that doctrine brings about. Thus
is it, O king, that they show forth the mighty glory of that state.

32\. 'And how do they show how purified that state is from every stain?
just, O king, as water, when it has fallen upon a lotus, flows away,
disperses, scatters, disappears, adheres not to it. And why so? Because
of the lotus being pure from any spot. Just so, O king, when whosoever
are deceitful, tricky, crafty, treacherous, holders of lawless opinions,
have been admitted into the religion of the Conquerors, it is not long
before they disperse, and scatter, and fall from that pure and
stainless, clear and faultless <span id="fr_190"></span>[1](#fn_188.md),
most high and excellent religion, and finding no standing-place in it,
adhering no longer to it, they return to the lower state. And why so?
Because the religion of the Conquerors has been purified from every
stain. Thus is it, O king, that they show forth the purity of that state
from every stain.

33\. 'And how do they show how impossible it is for the sinful to dwell
within it together with the good? just, O king, as the great ocean does
not tolerate the continuance in it of a dead corpse <span
id="fr_191"></span>[2](#fn_189.md), but whatever corpse may be in the sea,
that does it bring quickly to the shore, and cast it out on to the dry
land. And why so? Because the ocean is

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

the abode of mighty creatures. Just so, O king, when whosoever are
sinful, foolish, with their zeal evaporated, distressed, impure, and
bad, have been admitted into the religion of the Conquerors, it is not
long before they abandon that religion, and dwelling no longer in
it--the abode of the mighty, the Arahats, purified, and free from the
Great Evils <span id="fr_192"></span>[1](#fn_190.md)--they return to the
lower state. And why so? Because it is impossible for the wicked to
dwell in the religion of the Conquerors. Thus is it, O king, that they
show forth the impossibility of the sinful to abide within it together
with the good.

34\. 'And how do they show how difficult a state it is to grasp? just, O
king, as archers who are clumsy, untrained, ignorant, and bereft of
skill, are incapable of high feats of archery, such as
hairsplitting <span id="fr_193"></span>[2](#fn_191.md), but miss the
object, and shoot beyond the mark. And why so? Because of the fineness
and minuteness of the horse-hair. \[**251**\] just so, O king, when
foolish, stupid, imbecile <span id="fr_194"></span>[3](#fn_192.md), dull,
slow-minded

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

fellows renounce the world according to the doctrine of the Conquerors,
then they, unable to grasp the exquisitely fine and subtle distinctions
of the Four Truths, missing them, going beyond them, turn back before
long to the lower state. And why so? Because it is so difficult to
penetrate into the finenesses and subtleties of the Truths. This is how
they show forth the difficulty of its realisation.

35\. 'And how do they show how many are the restraints to be observed
within it? just, O king, as a man who had gone to a place where a mighty
battle was going on, when, surrounded on all sides by the forces of the
enemy, he sees the armed hosts crowding in upon him, will give way, turn
back, and take to flight. And why so? Out of fear lest he should not be
saved in the midst of so hot a fight. Just so, O king, when whosoever
are wicked <span id="fr_195"></span>[1](#fn_193.md), unrestrained,
shameless, foolish, full of ill-will, fickle, unsteady, mean and stupid,
renounce the world under the system of the Conquerors, then they, unable
to carry out the manifold precepts, give way, turn back, and take to
flight, and so before long return to the lower state. And why so?
Because of the multiform nature of the restraints to be observed in the
religion of the Conquerors. Thus is it, O king, that they show forth the
manifoldness of the restraints to be observed.

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

36\. 'As on that best of flowering shrubs, O king, the double
jasmine <span id="fr_196"></span>[1](#fn_194.md), there may be flowers that
have been pierced by insects, and their tender stalks being cut to
pieces, they may occasionally fall down. But by their having fallen is
not the jasmine bush disgraced. For the flowers that still remain upon
it pervade every direction with their exquisite perfume. Just so, O
king, whosoever having renounced the world under the system of the
Conquerors, return again to the lower state, are, like jasmine flowers
bitten by the insects and deprived of their colour and their smell,
colourless as it were in their behaviour, and incapable of development.
But by their backsliding is not the religion of the Conquerors put to
shame. For the members of the Order who remain in the religion pervade
the world of gods and men with the exquisite perfume of their right
conduct.

37\. 'Among rice plants that are healthy \[**252**\] and ruddy there may
spring up a kind of rice plant called Karumbhaka <span
id="fr_197"></span>[2](#fn_195.md), and that may occasionally fade. But by
its fading are not the red rice plants disgraced. For those that remain
become the food of kings. Just so, O king, whosoever having renounced
the world under the system of the Conquerors return again to the lower
state, they, like Karumbhaka plants among the red rice, may grow not,
nor attain development, and may even occasionally relapse into the lower
state. But by their backsliding is not the religion of the Conquerors
put to shame,

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

for the brethren that remain stedfast become fitted even for Arahatship.

38\. 'On one side, O king, of a wish conferring gem a roughness <span
id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_196.md) may arise. But by the appearance of that
roughness is not the gem disgraced. For the purity that remains in the
gem fills the people with gladness. And just so, O king, whosoever
having renounced the world under the system of the Conquerors return
again to the lower state, they may be rough ones and fallen ones in the
religion. But by their backsliding is not the religion of the Conquerors
put to shame, for the brethren who remain stedfast are the cause of joy
springing up in the hearts of gods and men.

39\. 'Even red sandal wood of the purest sort, O king, may become in
some portion of it rotten and scentless. But thereby is not the sandal
wood disgraced. For that portion which remains wholesome and sweet
scatters and diffuses its perfume all around. And just so, O king,
whosoever having renounced the world under the system of the Conquerors
return again to the lower state, they, like the rotten part of the
sandal wood, may be as it were thrown away in the religion. But by their
backsliding is not the religion of the Conquerors put to shame. For the
brethren who remain stedfast pervade, with the sandal wood perfume of
their right conduct, the world of gods and men.'

'Very good, Nâgasena! By one appropriate simile after another, by one
correct analogy after another have you most excellently made clear the

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

faultlessness of the system of the Conquerors, and shown it free from
blame. And even those who have lapsed make evident how excellent that
system is.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

(Here ends the dilemma as to those who have lapsed.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[DILEMMA THE FIFTY-SEVENTH.  
WHY HAVE ARAHATS NO POWER OVER THEIR BODIES?\]

40\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, your (members of the Order) say: \[**253**\]

"There is one kind of pain only which an Arahat suffers, bodily pain,
that is, and not mental <span id="fr_199"></span>[1](#fn_197.md)."

'How is this, Nâgasena? The Arahat keeps his mind going by means of the
body. Has the Arahat no lordship, no mastery, no power over the body?'

'No, he has not, O king.'

'That, Sir, is not right that over the body, by which he keeps his mind
going, he should have neither lordship, nor mastery, nor power. Even a
bird, Sir, is lord and master and ruler over the nest in which he
dwells.'

41\. 'There are these ten qualities, O king, inherent in the body, which
run after it, as it were, and accompany it from existence to
existence <span id="fr_200"></span>[2](#fn_198.md). And what are the ten?
Cold and heat, hunger and thirst,

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

the necessity of voiding excreta, fatigue and sleepiness, old age,
disease, and death. And in respect thereof, the Arahat is without
lordship, without mastery, without power.'

'Venerable Nâgasena, what is the reason why the commands of the Arahat
have no power over his body, neither has he any mastery over it? Tell me
that.

'Just, O king, as whatever beings are dependent on the land, they all
walk, and dwell, and carry on their business in dependence upon it. But
do their commands have force, does their mastery extend over it?'

'Certainly not, Sir!'

'Just so, O king, the Arahat keeps his mind going through the body. And
yet his commands have no authority over it, nor power.'

42\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, why is it that the ordinary man suffers both
bodily and mental pain?'

'By reason, O king, of the untrained state of his mind. just, O king, as
an ox when trembling with starvation might be tied up with a weak and
fragile and tiny rope of grass or creeper. But if the ox were
excited <span id="fr_201"></span>[1](#fn_199.md) then would he escape,
dragging the fastening with him. Just so, O king, when pain comes upon
him whose mind is untrained, then is his mind excited, and the mind so
excited bends his body this way and that and makes it grovel on the
ground, \[**254**\] and he, being thus untrained in mind, trembles <span
id="fr_202"></span>[2](#fn_200.md) and cries, and gives forth terrible

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

groans. This is why the ordinary man, O king, suffers pain as well in
body as in mind.'

43\. 'Then why, Sir, does the Arahat only suffer one kind of
pain--bodily, that is, and not mental?'

'The mind of the Arahat, O king, is trained, well practised, tamed,
brought into subjection, and obedient, and it hearkens to his word. When
affected with feelings of pain, he grasps firmly the idea of the
impermanence of all things, so ties his mind as it were to the post of
contemplation, and his mind, bound to the post of contemplation, remains
unmoved, unshaken, becomes stedfast, wanders not--though his body the
while may bend this way and that and roll in agony by the disturbing
influence of the pain. This is why it is only one kind of pain that the
Arahat suffers--bodily pain, that is, and not mental.'

44., Venerable Nâgasena, that verily is a most marvellous thing that
when the body is trembling the mind should not be shaken. Give me a
reason for that.'

'Suppose, O king, there were a noble tree, mighty in trunk and branches
and leaves. And when agitated by the force of the wind its branches
should wave. Would the trunk also move

'Certainly not, Sir!'

'Well, O king, the mind of the Arahat is as the trunk of that noble
tree.'

' <span id="fr_203"></span>[1](#fn_201.md)Most wonderful, Nâgasena, and
most strange!

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Never before have I seen a lamp of the law that
burned thus brightly through all time.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma as to the Arahat's power over his body.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[DILEMMA THE FIFTY-EIGHTH.  
THE LAYMAN'S SIN.\]

45\. \[**255**\] 'Venerable Nâgasena, suppose a layman had been guilty
of a Pârâ*g*ika offence <span id="fr_204"></span>[1](#fn_202.md), and some
time after should enter the Order. And neither he himself should be
aware that when still a layman he had so been guilty, nor should any one
else inform him, saying: "When a layman you were guilty of such an
offence." Now if he were to devote himself to the attainment of
Arahatship <span id="fr_205"></span>[2](#fn_203.md), would he be able so to
comprehend the Truth as to succeed in entering upon the Excellent Way?'

'No, O king, he would not.'

'But why not, Sir?'

'That, in him, which might have been the cause of his grasping the Truth
has been, in him, destroyed. No comprehension can therefore take place.'

46\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, your people say:

"To him who is aware (of an offence) there comes

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

remorse. When remorse has arisen there is an obstruction in the heart.
To him whose heart is obstructed there is no comprehension of the
Truth <span id="fr_206"></span>[1](#fn_204.md)."

'Why should there then be no such comprehension to one not aware of his
offence, feeling no remorse, remaining with a quiet heart. This dilemma
touches on two irreconcilable statements. Think well before you solve
it.'

47\. 'Would selected seed <span id="fr_207"></span>[2](#fn_205.md), O king,
successfully sown in a well-ploughed, well-watered, fertile soil, come
to maturity?'

'Certainly, Sir!'

'But would the same seed grow on the surface of a thick slab of rock?'

'Of course not.'

'Why then should the same seed grow in the mud, and not on the rock?'

'Because on the rock the cause for its growth does not exist. Seeds
cannot grow without a cause.'

'Just so, O king, the cause by reason of which his comprehension of the
Truth (his conversion) might have been brought about, has been rooted
out in him. Conversion cannot take place without a cause.'

48\. '\[Give me, Sir, another simile <span
id="fr_208"></span>[3](#fn_206.md).'\]

'Well, O king, will sticks and clods and cudgels <span
id="fr_209"></span>[4](#fn_207.md)

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

and clubs find a resting-place in the air, in the same way as they do on
the ground?'

'No, Sir.'

'But what is the reason why they come to rest on the earth, when they
will not stand in the air?'

'There is no cause in the air for their stability, and without a cause
they will \[**256**\] not stand.'

'Just so, O king, by that fault of his the cause for his conversion has
been removed. And without a cause there can be no conversion. Now will
fire, O king, burn in water in the same way as it will on land?'

'No, Sir.'

'But why not?'

'Because in water the conditions precedent for burning do not exist. And
there can be no burning without them.'

'Just so, O king, are the conditions precedent to conversion destroyed
in him by that offence of his. And when the conditions which would bring
it about are destroyed there can be no conversion.'

49\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, think over this matter once more. I am not yet
convinced about it. Persuade me by some reason how such obstruction can
occur in the case of one not aware of his offence, and feeling therefore
no remorse.'

'Would the Halâhala <span id="fr_210"></span>[1](#fn_208.md) poison, O
king, if eaten by

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

a man who did not know he had eaten it, take away his life?'

'Yes, Sir.'

'Just so, O king, is there an obstruction to his comprehension of the
Truth, who, without being aware of it, has committed a sin. And would
fire, O king, burn a man who walked into it unawares?'

'Yes, Sir.'

'Well, just so in the case you put. Or would a venomous snake, if it bit
a man without his knowing it, kill him?'

'Yes, Sir.'

'Well, just so in the case you put. And is it not true that Sama*n*a
Kola*ññ*a, the king of Kali<u>n</u>ga,--when surrounded by the seven
treasures of a sovereign overlord he went mounted on his state elephant
to pay a visit to his relatives,--was not able to pass the Tree of
Wisdom, though he was not aware that it was there <span
id="fr_211"></span>[1](#fn_209.md)? Well, of the same kind is the reason
why one who has committed an offence, even though he know it not, is
nevertheless incapable of rising to the knowledge of the Truth.'

'Verily, Nâgasena, this must be the word of the Conqueror. To find any
fault with it were vain. And this (explanation of yours) must be the
meaning of it. I accept it as you say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma of the layman's sin.\]

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

\[DILEMMA THE FIFTY-NINTH.  
THE GUILTY RECLUSE.\]

50\. \[**257**\] 'Venerable Nâgasena, what is the distinction, what the
difference, between a layman who has done wrong, and a Sama*n*a (member
of the Order) who has done wrong? Will they both be reborn in like
condition? Will the like retribution happen to both? Or is there any
difference?'

'There are, O king, ten qualities which abound in the guilty Sama*n*a,
distinguishing him from the guilty layman. And besides that, in ten ways
does the Sama*n*a purify the gifts that may be given him.

51\. 'And what are the ten qualities which abound in the guilty
Sama*n*a, distinguishing him from the guilty layman? The guilty
Sama*n*a, O king, is full of reverence for the Buddha, for the Law, for
the Order, and for his fellow-disciples; he exerts himself in putting
questions about, and in recitation of (the sacred texts); he is devoted
to learning, though he has done wrong. Then, O king, the guilty one
entering the assembly, enters it decently clad, he guards himself alike
in body and mind through fear of rebuke, his mind is set upon exerting
himself (towards the attainment of Arahatship), he is of the
companionship of the brethren. And even, O king, if he does wrong he
lives discreetly. just, O king, as a married woman sins only in secret
and in privacy, so does the guilty Sama*n*a walk discreetly in his
wrongdoing. These are the ten qualities, O king, found in the guilty
Sama*n*a, distinguishing him from the guilty layman.

52\. 'And what are the ten ways in which, besides,

he purifies a gift given to him? He purifies it in that he wears an
invulnerable coat of mail <span id="fr_212"></span>[1](#fn_210.md); in that
he is shorn in the fashion of the characteristic mark of renunciation
used by the seers of old <span id="fr_213"></span>[2](#fn_211.md); in that
he is one who is included in the multitude of the brethren; in that he
has taken his refuge in the Buddha, the Law, and the Order; in that he
dwells in a lonely spot suitable for the exertion (after Arahatship); in
that he seeks after the treasure of the teaching of the Conquerors; in
that he preaches the most excellent law (Dhamma); in that his final
destiny is to be reborn in the island of truth <span
id="fr_214"></span>[3](#fn_212.md); in that he is possessed of an honest
belief that the Buddha is the chief of all beings; in that he has taken
upon himself the keeping of the Uposatha day. These, O king, are the ten
ways in which, besides, he purifies a gift given to him.

53\. \[**258**\] 'Even, O king, when thoroughly fallen, a guilty
Sama*n*a yet sanctifies the gifts of the supporters of the faith--just
as water, however thick, will wash away slush and mud and dirt and
stains--just as hot, and even boiling water will put a mighty blazing
fire out--just as food, however nasty, will allay the faintness of
hunger. For thus, O king, hath it been said by the god over all gods in
the most excellent Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya in the chapter "On gifts <span
id="fr_215"></span>[4](#fn_213.md):"

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

"Whene'er a good man, with believing heart,  
Presents what he hath earned in righteousness  
To th' unrighteous,--in full confidence  
On the great fruit to follow the good act--  
Such gift is, by the giver, sanctified."'

'Most wonderful, Nâgasena, and most strange! We asked you a mere
ordinary question, and you, expounding it with reasons and with similes,
have filled, as it were, the hearer with the sweet taste of the nectar
(of Nirvâ*n*a <span id="fr_216"></span>[1](#fn_214).md). just as a cook, or
a cook's apprentice, taking a piece of ordinary nutmeg, will, treating
it with various ingredients, prepare a dish for a king--so, Nâgasena,
when we asked you an ordinary question, have you, expounding it with
reasons and similes, filled the hearer with the sweet taste of the
nectar of Nirvâ*n*a.'

\[Here ends the dilemma as to the guilty recluse.\]

 

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

\[DILEMMA THE SIXTIETH.  
THE SOUL IN WATER.\]

54\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, this water when boiling over the fire gives
forth many a sound, hissing and simmering <span
id="fr_217"></span>[1](#fn_215.md). Is then, Nâgasena, the water alive? Is
it shouting at play? \[**259**\] or is it crying out at the torment
inflicted on it?'

'It is not alive, O king, there is no soul or being in water. It is by
reason of the greatness of the shock of the heat of the fire that it
gives forth sounds, hissing and simmering.'

'Now, venerable Nâgasena, there are false teachers who on the ground
that the water is alive reject the use of cold water, and warming the
water feed themselves on tepid foods of various kinds <span
id="fr_218"></span>[2](#fn_216.md).

'These men find fault with you and revile you, saying: "The Sakyaputtiya
Sama*n*as do injury to the souls of one function <span
id="fr_219"></span>[3](#fn_217.md)." Dispel, remove, get rid of this their
censure and blame.'

55\. 'The water is not alive, O king. Neither is there therein either
soul or being. And it is the

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

great shock of the heat of the fire that makes it sound, hissing and
simmering. It is like the water in holes in the ground, in ponds and
pools and lakes, in reservoirs, in crevices and chasms, in wells, in
low-lying places, and in lotus-tanks <span
id="fr_220"></span>[1](#fn_218.md), which before the mighty onset of the
hot winds <span id="fr_221"></span>[2](#fn_219.md) is so deeply affected
that it vanishes away. But does the water in that case, O king, give
forth many a sound, hissing and simmering?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'But, if it were alive, the water would then also make some sound. Know
therefore, O king, that there is no soul, neither being, in water; and
that it is the greatness of the shock of the heat of the water that
makes it give forth sounds.

56\. 'And hear another reason, O king, for the same thing. If water, O
king, with grains of rice in it, is put in a vessel and covered up, but
not placed over the fireplace, would it then give forth sound?'

'No, Sir. It would remain quiet and unmoved.'

'But if you were to put the same water, just as it is in the vessel,
over a fireplace <span id="fr_222"></span>[3](#fn_220.md), and then light
up the fire, would the water remain quiet and motionless?'

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

'Certainly not, Sir. It would move and be agitated, become perturbed and
all in commotion, waves would arise in it, it would rush up and down and
in every direction \[**260**\], it would roll up and boil over <span
id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_221.md), and a garland of foam would be formed
above it.'

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

'But why so, O king, when water in its ordinary state remains quiet and
motionless?'

'It is because of the powerful impulse of the heat of the fire that the
water, usually so still, gives forth many a sound, bubbling and
hissing.'

'Then thereby know, O king, that there is no soul in water, neither
being; and that it is the strong heat of the fire that causes it to make
sounds.

57\. 'And hear another reason, O king, for the same thing. Is there not
water to be found in every house put into water-pots with their mouths
closed up?'

'Yes, Sir.'

'Well, does that water move, is it agitated, perturbed, in commotion,
does it form into waves, does it rush up and down and in every
direction, does it roll up and roll over <span
id="fr_224"></span>[1](#fn_222.md), is it covered with foam?'

'No! That water is in its ordinary state. It remains still and quiet.'

'But have you ever heard that all this is true of the water in the great
ocean? and that rearing up <span id="fr_225"></span>[2](#fn_223.md) it
breaks against the strand with a mighty roar?'

'Yes, I have both heard of it, and have seen it myself--how the water in
the great ocean lifts itself up a hundred, two hundred, cubits high,
towards the sky.'

'But why, whereas water in its ordinary state remains motionless and
still, does the water in the ocean both move and roar?'

'That is by reason of the mighty force of the

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

onset of the wind, whereas the water in the water-jars neither moves nor
makes any noise, because nothing shakes it.'

'Well, the sounds given forth by boiling water are the result, in a
similar way, \[**261**\] of the great heat of the fire.'

58\. 'Do not people cover over the dried-up mouth of a drum <span
id="fr_226"></span>[1](#fn_224.md) with dried cow-leather?'

'Yes, they do.'

'Well, is there any soul or being, O king, in a drum?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'Then how is it that a drum makes sounds?'

'By the action or effort of a woman or a man.'

'Well, just as that is why the drum sounds, so is it by the effect of
the heat of the fire that the water sounds. And for this reason also you
might know, O king, that there is no soul, neither being, in water; and
that it is the heat of the fire which causes it to make sounds <span
id="fr_227"></span>[2](#fn_225.md).

59\. 'And I, too, O king, have something yet further to ask of you--thus
shall this puzzle be thoroughly threshed out. How is it? Is it true of
every kind of vessel that water heated in it makes noises, or only of
some kinds of vessels?'

'Not of all, Sir. Only of some.'

'But then you have yourself, O king, abandoned the position you took up.
You have come over to my side-that there is no soul, neither being, in
water. For only if it made noises in whatever

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

vessel it were heated could it be right to say that it had a soul. There
cannot be two kinds of water--that which speaks, as it were, which is
alive, and that which does not speak, and does not live. If all water
were alive, then that which the great elephants, when they are in rut,
suck up in their trunks, and pour out over their towering frames, or
putting into their mouths take right into their stomachs--that water,
too, when crushed flat between their teeth, would make a sound. And
great ships, a hundred cubits long, heavily laden, full of hundreds of
packages of goods, pass over the sea--the water crushed by them, too,
would make sounds. \[**262**\] And mighty fish, leviathans with bodies
hundreds of leagues long <span id="fr_228"></span>[1](#fn_226.md), since
they dwell in the great ocean, immersed in the depths of it, must, so
living in it, be constantly taking into their mouths and spouting out
the ocean--and that water, too, crushed between their gills or in their
stomach, would make sounds. But as, even when tormented with the
grinding and crushing of all such mighty things, the water gives no
sound, therefore, O king, you may take it that there is no soul, neither
being, in water.'

'Very good, Nâgasena! With fitting discrimination has the puzzle put to
you <span id="fr_229"></span>[2](#fn_227.md) been solved. just, Nâgasena,
as a gem of inestimable value which had come into the hands of an able
master goldsmith, clever and well trained, would meet with due
appreciation, estimation, and praise-just as a rare pearl

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

at the hands of a dealer in pearls, a fine piece of woven stuff at the
hands of a cloth merchant <span id="fr_230"></span>[1](#fn_228.md), or red
sandal wood at the hands of a perfumer--just so in that way has this
puzzle put to you been solved with the discrimination it deserved.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_121"></span>[43:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_123.md) This verse is found
three times in the Pi*t*akas--in the Mahâvagga I, 6, 8, in the
Ariya-pariyesana Sutta (Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya I, 171), and in the
A<u>n</u>gulimâla Sutta (Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya, No. 86). It occurs with
other stanzas of a similar tendency, and many of the lines in those
stanzas are repeated, but with variations and in a different order, by
the author of the Lalita Vistara (pp. 526, 527 of Râ*g*endra Lâl Mitra's
edition). One verse is found there in two detached lines which run thus
in the Sanskrit:--

Â*k*âryyo na hi me ka*sk*it, sad*ri*so me na vidyate

and

Sadevâsuragandharvvo nâsti me pratipudgala*h*.

Hîna*t*i-kumburê renders pa*t*ipuggalo, not by 'rival,' but by
superior.'

<span id="fn_122"></span>[43:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_124.md) Mr. Trenckner has
pointed out that this quotation is found in two Suttas, Nos. 85 and 100
in the Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[44:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_125.md) Hîna*t*i-kumburê
reads *G*âtimantî. It may be noted that Hardy (Manual of Buddhism, p.
149), who omits Ya*ññ*a, gives *G*âti and Manta as two separate names,
and spells the last two names Bho*g*a Sudanta.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[44:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_126.md) So also the
Si*m*halese, p. 329. But the *G*âtaka Commentary (verse 270 at vol. i,
p. 50) has konda*ññ*a.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[44:3](sbe3604.htm#fr_127.md) The *G*âtaka
Introduction (loc. cit.) has Bho*g*a. The Si*m*halese has Subho*g*a.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[44:4](sbe3604.htm#fr_128.md) Hîna*t*i-kumburê
agrees here with Hardy in reading Sudanta.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[44:5](sbe3604.htm#fr_129.md) This episode has not
been traced in the Pi*t*akas. The Si*m*halese here gives also the detail
of the one and two fingers, found in the *G*âtaka, and translated in my
'Buddhist Birth Stories,' p. 72.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[45:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_130.md) In the North-West.
See *G*âtaka I, 140, &c.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[45:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_131.md)
*Kh*a*l*a<u>n</u>gavanta*m*. These are phonetics, prosody, grammar,
exegesis, astronomy, and ritual. I was wrong in taking Childers's
interpretation of this word at 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' p. 72.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[45:3](sbe3604.htm#fr_132.md) This episode is also
not in the Pi*t*akas. On o*n*ogeti see Mahâvagga I, 22, 18. Sabbamitra
is given in the Thera Gâthâ, I, 150, as the name of a Thera, and in the
Divyâvadana, p. 420, as the name of Asoka's herald or court crier.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[45:4](sbe3604.htm#fr_133.md) There is nothing
about any such devatâ in the Pi*t*akas. Hîna*t*i-kumburê takes it to
mean the god who took the outward appearance of the four visions-an old
man, a sick man, a dead man, and a recluse. But in that story--which is
not related in the Pi*t*akas of the Buddha, though it is referred to in
connection with him at Buddhava*m*sa XXVI, p. 16--the god does not
speak. The only god whose words are said, in any of the later Pâli
legends, to have agitated the Bodisat's heart at that moment, was the
Evil One himself; and that only in one version of the legend, the Pâli
authority for which I cannot give. It is in Hardy's 'Manual,' p. 157,
where the speech of the Evil One, placed at *G*âtaka I, 63 at a later
time, is said to have been made at the moment of the Renunciation. Even
if it be not a mere blunder of Hardy's to put it at that time, still it
cannot be the speech referred to by our author. For the startling
doctrine that the Evil One himself was one of the Bodisat's teachers
would never have been smuggled in, as it were, by concealing the
identity of the spirit referred to under <span id="page_46">p. 46</span>
the generic term of devatâ, Now in the Fo-pan-hin-tsi-*k*in (Nanjio, No.
680), a Chinese work of the beginning of the seventh century A. D., we
find in the sixteenth kwuen or chapter (if one may trust the abstract
given in Beal's 'Romantic Legend,' p. 131) that a Devaputra named
Tsao-ping is said to have spoken to the Bodisat at the moment of the
Renunciation. It is scarcely open to doubt that our author had in his
mind an earlier form of that episode. But if so it is the only proved
case of his having Sanskrit, and not Pâli works, as his authority.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[48:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_139.md) Dhâto; not in
Childers, but see *G*âtaka II, 247, Mahâvagga VI, 25, 1, and below, IV,
6, 29.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[49:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_140.md) Literally 'mouth.' I
presume a small uncovered bullock cart is meant, like that figured in
Plate 57 in Cunningham's 'Bharhut Tope.' The chariot on the other hand
is of the shape given in Plates 3, 34, 35 of Fergusson's 'Tree and
Serpent Worship.' The usual form of the bullock cart has also a hood, or
cover, as clearly shown in Fergusson's Plate No. 65, and Cunningham's
Plate No. 34. But the one here referred to cannot have had the cover
over it, for then the supposition that more goods were piled on to it,
when full, would be an impossible one. I know of no other passage where
the mukha, literally 'mouth,' of a cart is mentioned, and I may possibly
be wrong in rendering it 'top.'

<span id="fn_139"></span>[49:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_141.md) This simile has
already been used in the Vessantara Dilemma above, I, 173.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[49:3](sbe3604.htm#fr_142.md) Our author himself
here confesses that his thoughts are more on edification than on logic.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[51:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_143.md) There is no general
word in Pâli for aunt or uncle. There are separate expressions for each
of the degrees of relationship expressed by those words in
English-mother's brother, father's sister, &c.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[51:3](sbe3604.htm#fr_145.md) From the *G*anta
Sutta (Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya, No. 142). See Mr. Trenckner's note.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[52:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_146.md) The translation of
these five technical terms of cloth-making is doubtful. The Si*m*halese
(p. 335) has pi*ñg*ana, sindina, pothita, ka*t*ina, wiyana.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[52:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_147.md) The Si*m*halese (p.
335) here gives at length the story of Pa*g*âpatî's gift, at the time
when Gotama returned, as the Buddha, to Kapilavatthu.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[53:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_148.md) On this list see
above, p. 234 of the Pâli text (IV, 5, 36).

<span id="fn_147"></span>[53:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_149.md) On these words
compare A<u>n</u>guttara Nikâya II, 4, 2.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[53:3](sbe3604.htm#fr_150.md) Akâmakaranîyâ.
Compare Vimâna Vatthu X, 6 and Dîgha Nikâya II, 46.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[54:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_151.md) The same simile has
already occurred, vol. i, p. 220 (IV, 2, 22).

<span id="fn_150"></span>[54:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_152.md) Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya,
vol. i, p. 13 (in Mr. Trenckner's edition for the Pâli Text Society).

<span id="fn_151"></span>[55:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_153.md) This must have been
composed after the moon god had become established in belief as the
husband, or lord, of the Nakshatras, or lunar mansions. For it cannot,
of course, be intended that the moon is itself a constellation.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[55:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_154.md) Sa*m*yutta, Nikâya
III, 2, 10 (vol. i, p. 67 of the Pâli Text Society's edition).

<span id="fn_153"></span>[55:3](sbe3604.htm#fr_155.md) These phrases of
approval are commonly used in the Pi*t*akas of words uttered by any one
whose sayings would not, of themselves, carry weight. So in the Dîgha
III, 1, 28 and in the Ma*ggh*ima I, 385.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[55:4](sbe3604.htm#fr_156.md) This verse has not
yet been traced in the Pi*t*akas. In <span id="page_56">p. 56</span> the
Thera Gâthâ we have a collection of verses ascribed to Sâriputta, but
this is not one of them. The literal translation is: 'There is but one
feeling of faith, but one taking of refuge, but one stretching forth of
the hands; (with joined palms, in adoration--that paid) to the Buddha,
who puts to rout the armies of the Evil One, and is able to make (us)
cross (the ocean of continual becomings).' The taking of refuge meant is
the confession, the repetition of which characterises a man as a
Buddhist--'I take my refuge in the Buddha, &c.'

<span id="fn_155"></span>[56:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_157.md) A<u>n</u>guttara
Nikâya I, 13, 1.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[56:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_158.md) That is, of insight
and of the: practice of right conduct.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[57:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_159.md) Samyutta Nikâya
XLIV, 24, says Mr. Trenckner. The passage has not yet been reached in M.
Léon Feer's edition for the Pâli Text Society. Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p. 341)
renders *ñ*âya by nirwâna.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[57:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_160.md) Literally 'a bed
encumbered, &c.' See below, p. 348 of the Pâli text, where the question,
as here, is whether such a layman can attain to the Nirvâ*n*a of
Arahatship.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[57:3](sbe3604.htm#fr_161.md) So the Buddha says
of himself (A<u>n</u>guttara Nikâya III, 38), that, in the days when he
was a layman, he never used any sandal wood except that from Benares.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[57:4](sbe3604.htm#fr_162.md) I don't know what
these four Sîlakkhandhas are. Morality is described in the Pi*t*akas as
threefold, fivefold, or tenfold, according as the Sîlas, in three
divisions (as translated in my 'Buddhist Suttas,' vol. xi of the 'Sacred
Books of the East,' pp. 189-200), are referred to; or the first five, or
the whole ten, of the moral precepts (the Buddhist Ten Commandments) set
out in my 'Buddhism,' p. 160. This reference to four divisions of the
moral code is foreign to the Pi*t*akas, at least as we yet know them.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[57:5](sbe3604.htm#fr_163.md) The Diya*ddh*esu
sikkhâpada-satesu. It is clear from the A<u>n</u>guttara Nikâya III, 83
that the precepts referred to are those of the Pâtimokkha (translated by
me at the beginning of 'Vinaya <span id="page_58">p. 58</span> Texts,'
vol. xvii of the 'Sacred Books of the East'), notwithstanding the fact
that the actual number of these rules is 227.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[58:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_164.md) The Dhutangas: see
above, IV, 5, 10, and the enumeration below at the translation of p. 351
of the Pâli text.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[59:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_165.md) Nârâ*k*a. As
Childers expresses a doubt as to the character of this weapon, I would
refer to the Ma*ggh*ima I, 429, *G*âtaka III, 322, and Milinda, pp. 105,
418 (of Mr. Trenckner's text).

<span id="fn_164"></span>[60:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_166.md) See 'Buddhist Birth
Stories,' pp. 90, 91; and Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya I, 240-246.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[60:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_167.md)
Alamariya-dassana-*ñ*â*n*a-visesa*m*. I am not sure of the exact meaning
of this compound. For alamariya the Si*m*halese has here (p. 343)
sarva*gñ*atâ, and renders the whole 'do I arrive at a superhuman
condition, at the distinctive faculty which is able to see into
omniscience,' and on IV, 8, 21 it gives a slightly different but
practically identical rendering, 'I shall not reach that superhuman
condition which can distinguish or which suffices for insight into the
supreme omniscience.'

<span id="fn_166"></span>[60:3](sbe3604.htm#fr_168.md) That is the wisdom
of Buddhahood. The passage is from the Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya I, 246 (quoted
also below, IV, 8, 21).

<span id="fn_167"></span>[60:4](sbe3604.htm#fr_169.md) This is a very
famous stanza. It is put into the mouth of <span id="page_61">p.
61</span> Abhibhû at Thera Gâthâ, verse 256, and in the Samyutta Nikâya
VI, 2, 4, §§ 18 and 23; and also, in its Sanskrit form, into the mouth
of the Buddha at the Divyâvadana, p. 300, and into the mouth of the gods
at ibid. p. 569. It is possibly another instance of our author having
Sanskrit, and not Pâli, authorities in his mind, that he ascribes it
here to the Buddha, and not to Abhibhû, the Elder.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[61:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_170.md) The Si*m*halese has
here six pages of description of the austerities not found in the Pâli
text.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[62:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_171.md) Pakkha-hato: should
become like one whose two hands are ruined' says the Si*m*halese here
(p. 349), but at p. 411 (on p. 276 of the Pâli) it translates the same
term, 'whose hands and feet are broken.' It is literally 'should become
side-destroyed,' and may mean paralysed.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[63:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_172.md) Tâva*t*aka*m*. I
take this word, in the sense of 'mere,' as an accusative in agreement
with gihim (see the use of the word at pp. 107, 115, 241 of the Pâli
text), and not as an accusative of motion, 'into so great a sâsana*m*.'

<span id="fn_171"></span>[63:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_173.md) That is till he be
converted, till he has 'entered the stream.' See 'Buddhism,' p. 101.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[63:3](sbe3604.htm#fr_174.md) That is, of a
layman.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[63:4](sbe3604.htm#fr_175.md) Ta*l*âka, which
Childers wrongly renders 'pond, pool, lake.' It is always an artificial
tank, reservoir. See *K*ullavagga X, 1, 6; *G*âtaka I, 239; Milinda, pp.
66, 81, 296.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[64:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_176.md) 'Vimutti: of the
nectar of the Nirvâ*n*a which is the highest fruit of Arahatship' is
Hîna*t*i-kumburê's gloss.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[64:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_177.md)
Roguppatti-kusala*m*: 'skilled in the threefold origin of disease' says
the Si*m*halese (p. 351). See also pp. 248, 272 of the Pâli text.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[65:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_178.md) The Si*m*halese (p.
352) inserts here 'Give me, Sir, I pray you, another simile,' and then
goes on 'Then suppose, O king, &c.'

<span id="fn_177"></span>[65:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_179.md) Bhatta, perhaps
rice, as the food par excellence.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[66:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_180.md) Kayâgata-sati:
literally 'intentness of mind on (the truth relating to) bodies.'

<span id="fn_179"></span>[66:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_181.md)
Kilesa-kilant-a*ggh*attâ. Compare *kh*âta*ggh*atta*m*, *G*âtaka I, 345.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[67:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_182.md) Stonemasons and
sculptors are implied as well as navvies. Compare my note at 'Buddhist
Suttas,' p. 262.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[67:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_183.md)
Sabhâva-isi-bhattiko. Compare Siva-bhattiko (Saivite) at Mahâva*m*sa,
chapter 93, line 17. In râ*g*a-bhattiko (above, p. 142 of the Pâli text)
the connotation is different. The Si*m*halese (p. 353) repeats the
phrase.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[67:3](sbe3604.htm#fr_184.md) Suta-manta-dharo,
which the Si*m*halese repeats.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[67:4](sbe3604.htm#fr_185.md) Atakkiko: 'without
the theories (vitarka) resorted to by those ignorant of the practice of
medicine' says Hîna*t*i-kumburê.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[68:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_186.md) As A*g*âtasattu is
said to have done for Devadatta at *G*âtaka I, 186.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[68:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_187.md) See above, IV, 6, 5.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[69:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_188.md) Nibbisesa, not in
Childers; but see, for instance, *G*âtaka II, 32.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[69:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_189.md) Paridha*m*sati.
Compare below, IV, 7, 8 (p. 265 of the Pâli).

<span id="fn_188"></span>[70:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_190.md)
Nikka*nt*aka-pa*nd*ara: literally 'thornless and yellow-white.' The
second of these epithets of the religion (sâsana) is applied to it
above, IV, 6, 23 (p. 250 of the Pâli). The Si*m*halese merely repeats
them.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[70:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_191.md) On this curious
belief see the note above on IV, 3, 39 (p. 187 of the Pâli).

<span id="fn_190"></span>[71:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_192.md) They are lust,
dulness, delusion, and ignorance.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[71:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_193.md) Vâlaggavedha*m*,
'hair-splitting;' which is also used in the Pi*t*akas in the secondary
sense we too have given to it.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[71:3](sbe3604.htm#fr_194.md) E*l*amûga, supposed
to mean literally 'deaf and dumb;' but often (if not always) used in
this secondary sense. See *G*âtaka I, 247, 248 (where both MSS. read
elamûga), and Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya I, 20 (where Mr. Trenckner has an
interesting note). In both places the fifth century commentators explain
the word by lâla-nukha, 'drivelling,' supposing it to be derived from
elâ, saliva,' and mûkha, 'mouth.' This is certainly wrong, for the last
part of the compound is mûka, dumb.' The fact is that the word was a
puzzle, even then. The meaning assigned to it by both Pâli and Sanskrit
lexicographers of 'deaf and dumb' has not yet been confirmed by a single
passage either in Pâli or Sanskrit. And as e*d*a, 'sheep,' is common in
both, in its longer form of e*d*aka, e*l*aka, the compound probably
meant originally 'as dumb <span id="page_72">p. 72</span> as a sheep,'
which would be a quite satisfactory basis for the secondary sense of
'imbecile,' in which alone it can be traced in Pâli. For the Sanskrit
form e*d*amûka Böhtlingk-Roth give only lexicographers as authority. So
elâ, 'saliva,' is in Pâli only a lexicographer's word, and may have been
invented to explain e*l*amûga, and ane*l*agalâ vâkâ, as at
Suma<u>n</u>gala, p. 282.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[72:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_195.md) Pâkata.
Hîna*t*i-kumburê says (p. 356) pâpakalâwû, which suggests a different
reading.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[73:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_196.md) Vassikâ. So also
above, IV, 3, 32 (p. 183 of the Pâli).

<span id="fn_195"></span>[73:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_197.md) A yellowish white
kâwalu sort' says Hîna*t*i-kumburê, and Clough renders kâwalu by 'a
species of panic grass' (panicum glaucum). The word has only been found
in this passage.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[74:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_198.md) Kakkasa*m*. The
Si*m*halese (p. 357) has left out this clause, evidently by mistake
only.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[75:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_199.md) This passage has not
yet been traced in the Pi*t*akas. An almost identical phrase has already
been quoted, as said by the Buddha himself, at II, 1, 4 (p. 44 of the
Pâli).

<span id="fn_198"></span>[75:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_200.md) Bhave bhave
anuparivattanti. See IV, 4, 41 (p. 204 Of the Pâli).

<span id="fn_199"></span>[76:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_201.md) Parikupati, not in
Childers; but see above, IV, 1, 38 (p. 118 of the Pâli).

<span id="fn_200"></span>[76:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_202.md) Tasati. Mr.
Trenckner points out (p. 431) that two MSS <span id="page_77">p.
77</span> read rasati and one sarati. The Si*m*halese rendering (p.
359), bhaya wanneya, confirms the reading he has adopted.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[77:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_203.md) The Si*m*halese (p.
360) has four lines here that are not in the Pâli.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[78:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_204.md) This, for a member
of the Order, would be either unchastity, theft, murder, or putting
forward false claims to extraordinary holiness. See 'Vinaya Texts,' part
i, pp. 3-5. But Hîna*t*i-kumburê takes the word Pârâ*g*ika here in the
sense of matricide, parricide, injuring a Bo Tree, murder of an Arahat,
wounding a Tathâgata, or rape of a nun.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[78:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_205.md) Tathattâya. Rahat
phala pi*n*isa pilipadane wî nam, says the Si*m*halese (p. 361).

<span id="fn_204"></span>[79:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_206.md) This passage has not
yet been traced in the Pi*t*akas.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[79:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_207.md) Sârada*m* bî*g*am.
'Seed which will give sâra.' It has nothing to do with sârada*m*,
autumn.' See Sa*m*yutta Nikâya XXII, 24.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[79:3](sbe3604.htm#fr_208.md) Added from the
Si*m*halese (p. 362). It is not in the Pâli.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[79:4](sbe3604.htm#fr_209.md) Laku*t*a, not in
Childers. But see below (p. 301 of the Pâli text). It is probably the
same Dravidian word as appears in the Sanskrit dictionaries as la*g*uda.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[80:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_210.md) There is a curious
confusion about this word. It is found in post-Buddhistic Sanskrit in
the sense of a particular sort of strong poison, and in this sense it
occurs also in the *G*âtaka Commentary I, 271; III, 103; and in the
Tela-ka*t*âha-gâthâ, verse 82. In none of these passages is the nature
of the poison at all explained; it is taken for granted as a well-known
powerful poison. But above (p. 122 of the Pâli), and at *G*âtaka I, 47,
48, it is used in <span id="page_81">p. 81</span> the sense of kolâhala,
'noise' (compare the Sanskrit halahalâ, used as a cry or call). In this
sense it is probably a mere imitation of the supposed sound. In the
sense of poison its derivation is doubtful.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[81:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_211.md) This must be the
incident referred to at *G*âtaka IV, 232, though the name of the king is
given (on the previous page) simply as Kâli<u>n</u>go and not as
Sama*n*a-kola*ññ*o.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[83:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_212.md) 'The threefold
robes, the Arahad-dha*g*a, for the suppression of all evil, worn by all
the Buddhas' adds the Si*m*halese (p. 364). Compare above, vol. i, p.
190.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[83:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_213.md) The Rishis; 'who
were gaining the Swarga-moksha' adds the Si*m*halese. (It was before the
days of Arahatship.)

<span id="fn_212"></span>[83:3](sbe3604.htm#fr_214.md) Dhamma-dîpa, that is
to reach Arahatship, Nirvâ*n*a. Compare the *G*âtaka stanza, IV, 121,
verse 3.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[83:4](sbe3604.htm#fr_215.md) The Dakkhi*n*â
Vibha<u>n</u>ga, No. 12 in the Vibha<u>n</u>ga Vagga, No. 142 in the
whole Nikâya.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[84:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_216.md) Amata-madhura*m*
savanûpaga*m* akâsi. Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p. 365) understands this
differently, and has apparently read amata*m* madhura*m*. For he
translates 'filled the hearer with the taste of Nirvâ*n*a, and adorned
the least of the people with the ear-ring of Arahatship.' It is
difficult to see where he finds 'the least of the people,' and there is
no authority for rendering savanûpaga*m* by 'ear-ring.' Amata as an
epithet of the state of mind called by Western writers Nirvâ*n*a (which
is only one of many names applied in the Buddhist books themselves to
Arahatship) has nothing to do with immortality. As this wrong notion of
the use of the word has led to much confusion, I have considered in an
appendix all the passages in which the epithet occurs.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[85:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_217.md) Ki*kk*i*t*âyati
*k*i*t*i*k*i*t*âyati. The English words entirely fail in representing
the sound of these striking words (in which the *k* is pronounced as
ch). They recur Mahâvagga VI, 26, 7 and Puggala Pa*ññ*atti 3, 14.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[85:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_218.md)
Veka*t*ika-veka*t*ikam. Hîna*t*i-kumburê renders this by
hu*n*u-hu*n*uye*m*, and hu*n*u is the Pâli u*n*ha. But the expression
may be compared with vika*t*a, filth' (used for food), at Mahâvagga VI,
14, 6. On the belief of the *G*ains in the 'waterlife,' see the
Âyâra<u>n</u>ga Sutta I, 1, 3 (in vol. xxii of the S. B. E., p. 5).

<span id="fn_217"></span>[85:3](sbe3604.htm#fr_219.md) Ekindriya*m*
gîva*m*. The belief in such a soul is to be understood as held by the
teachers referred to, not by Buddhists. Hîna*t*i-kumburê's translation
implies that the one function meant is prâ*n*a. Compare the heretical
opinions described in the Dîgha II, 20, and 26.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[86:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_220.md) This list recurs in
almost identical terms below, p. 296 (of the Pâli text). See also above,
II, 1, 10, (vol. 1, p. 55).

<span id="fn_219"></span>[86:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_221.md) Vâtâtapa, not 'heat
and wind' as Böhtlingk-Roth understand it in their rendering of
vâtâtapika. See Vinaya Texts,' III, 159 and Samyutta XXII, 12.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[86:3](sbe3604.htm#fr_222.md) Uddhane. This word
is always rendered 'oven' in the dictionaries. But I doubt whether there
were ovens at all, in our sense, in those times, and in any case, the
word certainly means a fireplace made of bits of brick between which the
wood for the fire is laid. We must imagine the bricks to be laid, as a
general rule, in a triangle. I have often seen both Si*m*halese
peasants, and Tamils from the Madras Presidency, boiling their rice in
the open over such extemporised fireplaces in pots either placed on the
<span id="page_87">p. 87</span> bricks, or more usually suspended from
three sticks meeting above the centre of the space between the bricks.
That this, and this only, is the sense in which the word is used in Pâli
is clear from a comparison of the passages in which it is used, though
of course in huts the fireplace, though of the same kind, would be a
more permanent structure. I have not traced the word in the Pi*t*akas.
In the *G*âtaka Commentary I, 68 we find that smoke usually rises
uddhanato. This it would not do from an oven. At *G*âtaka I, 33 and
Dhammapada Commentary 176 uddhane âropetvâ must mean 'lifted up on to'
not 'put into.' At *G*âtaka I, 346 the speaker says he will take the
uddhana-kapallâni, and the rice with ingredients for the curry, up on to
the flat roof of the house, and there cook and eat them. These are the
bits of brick to make, not an oven, but a fireplace of. At Gâtaka II,
133 the husband wrings the neck of the parrot (the parrot of the Arabian
Nights, chap. 2, I may add) and throws it uddhanantaresu 'into the space
(between the bricks) of the fireplace.' At *G*âtaka III, 178 and
Dhammapada Commentary 263 we hear of meat boiled on the uddhana. In the
Rasavâhini (quoted in the 'Journal of the Pâli Text Society,' 1884, p.
53) the context shows that a fireplace or hearth, not an oven, is meant.
Finally above (p. 118 of the Pâli) we hear of a cauldron being mounted
on to an uddhana, and the fire being lighted under it.

The derivation is uncertain. The Sanskrit lexicographers give various
forms of the word--always with the meaning 'oven'--uddhâna, udvâna,
uddhmâna (this last probably influenced by a supposition that the word
was connected with dham). The Si*m*halese is uduna, and though
'fireplace' is better than 'oven,' we have really no corresponding word
in English. The gypsies, who are Indian in origin, should have a name
for it. But I only find in their vocabularies yogongo-tan, which means
simply aggi*th*âna.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[87:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_223.md) Uttarati patarati.
'Itirenneya pœtirenneya' says the Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[88:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_224.md) Uttarati patarati,
the second of which the Si*m*halese (p. 368) omits here. See p. 117 of
the Pâli.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[88:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_225.md) Ussakkitvâ,
'continually pumping up,' says the Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[89:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_226.md) Bheri-pokkharam,
which the Si*m*halese renders bheri-mukha. Compare Vimâna Vatthu 18, 10,
where pokkhara is a sort of drum.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[89:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_227.md) A similar analogy
has been used above, vol. i, p. 48.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[90:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_228.md) Their names are
given. On this belief see above, III, 7, 10 (vol. i, p. 130) and
*K*ullavagga IX, 1, 3.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[90:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_229.md) Desâgato, 'based on
the teaching of the Omniscient One,' says Hîna*t*i-kumburê, who
therefore apparently read desanâgato.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[91:1](sbe3604.htm#fr_230.md) Dussika, a word only
found, so far as I know, here and below at V, 4 (p. 331 of the Pâli),
where see the note.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[91:2](sbe3604.htm#fr_231.md) Sakala-*g*ana
mano-mandanîyya-wû sri-saddharmâ-dâsayehi sha*t*wana vargaya nimiyeya,
says the Si*m*halese.
