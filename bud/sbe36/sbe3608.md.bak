# BOOK VI.

### THE DHUTA<u>N</u>GAS.

\[**348**\] 1. The king saw Bhikkhus in the forest, lone  
And far away from men, keeping hard vows.  
And then he saw too householders, at home,  
Eating the sweet fruits of the Noble Path <span
id="fr_600"></span>[1](#fn_597.md).  
Considering both of these, deep doubts he felt.  
'If laymen also realise the Truth  
Then surely vowing vows must be in vain.  
Come! let me ask that best of teachers, wise  
In the threefold basket of the Buddha's words,  
Skilled to o'erthrow the arguments of the foe.  
He will be able to resolve my doubts!'

2\. Now Milinda the king went up to the place where Nâgasena was, and
bowed down before him, and took his seat on one side. And when so
seated, he said to Nâgasena: 'Venerable Nâgasena, is there any layman
living at home, enjoying the pleasures of sense, occupying a dwelling
encumbered with wife and children, enjoying the use of sandal wood from
Benares, and of garlands, perfumes, and ointments, accepting gold and
silver, with an embroidered head-dress on, set with diamonds and pearls
and gold-is there any such who has seen face to face the calm, the
supreme good, Nirvâ*n*a

'Not one hundred only, O king, nor two nor

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

three nor five nor six hundred, not a thousand only, nor a hundred
thousand, nor ten millions, nor ten thousand millions, not even only a
billion laymen (have seen Nirvâ*n*a)--not to speak of twenty or thirty
or a hundred or a thousand who have attained to clear understanding (of
the four Truths) <span id="fr_601"></span>[1](#fn_598.md). By

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

what kind of exposition shall I lay before you evidence showing that I
know this <span id="fr_602"></span>[1](#fn_599.md)?'

'Do you yourself tell me <span id="fr_603"></span>[2](#fn_600.md).'

3\. 'Then, O king, I will explain it. All those passages in the ninefold
word of the Buddha that deal with holiness of life, \[**349**\] and
attainment of the path, and the divisions of the excellent habit of
living under vows, shall be brought to bear in this connection <span
id="fr_604"></span>[3](#fn_601.md). Just, O king, as water which has rained
down upon a country district, with both low-lying and high places, level
land and undulations, dry ground and wet, will-all of it-flow off thence
and meet together in the ocean of great waters; so will all those
passages meet together, and be brought into connection, here. And a
manifestation of reasons out of my experience and knowledge shall be
also brought to bear. Thus will this matter be thoroughly analysed, its
beauty will be brought out <span id="fr_605"></span>[4](#fn_602.md), it
will be exhausted <span id="fr_606"></span>[5](#fn_603.md), brought home

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

to rest <span id="fr_607"></span>[1](#fn_604.md). It will be, O king, as
when an able writing-master, on exhibiting, by request, his skill in
writing, will supplement the written signs by an explanation of reasons
out of his experience and knowledge, and thus that writing of his
becomes finished, perfect, without defect. So will I also bring to bear
a manifestation of reasons out of my experience and knowledge; and thus
shall this matter be thoroughly analysed, its beauty shall be brought
out, it shall be exhausted, set at rest <span
id="fr_608"></span>[2](#fn_605.md).

4\. 'In the city of Sâvatthi, O king, about fifty millions of the
disciples of the Blessed One, devout men and devout women, were walking
in the paths, and out of those three hundred and fifty-seven
thousand <span id="fr_609"></span>[3](#fn_606.md) were established in the
fruit of the third path. And all of them were laity, not members of the
Order. And there too, at the foot of the Ga*nd*amba tree, when the
double miracle took place <span id="fr_610"></span>[4](#fn_607.md), two
hundred millions of living beings <span id="fr_611"></span>[5](#fn_608.md)
penetrated to an understanding (of the four Truths). And again on the
delivery of the Râhulovâda <span id="fr_612"></span>[6](#fn_609.md)
discourse, and of the Mahâ Mangala <span id="fr_613"></span>[7](#fn_610.md)
discourse, and of the Sama*k*itta <span id="fr_614"></span>[8](#fn_611.md)
exposition, and of the

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Parâbhava <span id="fr_615"></span>[1](#fn_612.md)
discourse, and of the Purâbheda <span id="fr_616"></span>[2](#fn_613.md)
discourse, and of the Kalaha-vivâda discourse, and of the
*K*ûla-vyûha <span id="fr_617"></span>[1](#fn_612.md) discourse, and of the
Mahâ-vyûha <span id="fr_618"></span>[1](#fn_612.md) discourse, and of the
Tuwa*t*aka <span id="fr_619"></span>[1](#fn_612.md) discourse, and of the
Sâriputta <span id="fr_620"></span>[1](#fn_612.md) discourse, an
innumerable number of celestial beings penetrated to knowledge (of the
four Truths). In the city of Râ*g*agaha three hundred and fifty thousand
devout laymen and devout laywomen, disciples of the Blessed One, were
walking in the Paths. And there again at the taming of Dhanapâla the
great elephant <span id="fr_621"></span>[3](#fn_614.md) nine hundred
million living beings, and again at the meeting at the Pâsâ*n*ika
*K*etiya on the occasion of the Pârâyana discourse <span
id="fr_622"></span>[4](#fn_615.md) one hundred and forty million living
beings, and again at the Indasâla cave eight hundred millions of gods,
and again at Benares \[**350**\] in the deer park Isipatana at the first
preaching of the Dhamma <span id="fr_623"></span>[5](#fn_616.md) one
hundred and eighty million Brahmâ gods and innumerable others, and again
in the heaven of the Thirty-Three at the preaching of the Abhidhamma on
the Pa*nd*u Kambala Rock <span id="fr_624"></span>[6](#fn_617.md) eight
hundred millions of the gods, and on the descent from the world of the
gods at the gate of the city of Sa<u>n</u>kassa <span
id="fr_625"></span>[6](#fn_617.md), at the miracle of the manifestation to
the world <span id="fr_626"></span>[7](#fn_618.md),

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

three hundred millions of believing men and deities penetrated to a
knowledge (of the four Truths). And again at Kapila-vatthu among the
Sakyas, at the preaching of the Buddhava*m*sa <span
id="fr_627"></span>[1](#fn_619.md) in the Nigrodha Arâma, and again at the
preaching of the Mahâ Samaya Suttanta <span
id="fr_628"></span>[2](#fn_620.md), gods in numbers that cannot be counted
penetrated to a knowledge of the Dhamma. And again at the assemblies on
the occasions of Sumana the garland maker <span
id="fr_629"></span>[3](#fn_621.md), and of Garahadinna, and of Ânanda the
rich man, and of Gambuka the naked ascetic <span
id="fr_630"></span>[4](#fn_622.md), and of Ma*nd*ûka the god, and of
Ma*tt*a-ku*nd*ali the god, and of Sulasâ the courtesan <span
id="fr_631"></span>[1](#fn_619.md), and of Sirimâ the courtesan, and of the
weaver's daughter, and of Subhaddâ, and of the spectacle of the
cremation of the Brahman of Sâketa, and of the Sûnâparantas, and of the
problem put by Sakka <span id="fr_632"></span>[6](#fn_623.md), and of the
Tiroku*dd*a Sutta <span id="fr_633"></span>[7](#fn_624.md), and of the
Ratana Sutta <span id="fr_634"></span>[8](#fn_625.md)--at each of these
eighty-four thousand penetrated to a knowledge of the Dhamma. So long, O
king, as the Blessed One remained in the world, so long wheresoever in
the three great divisions

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

(of India) <span id="fr_635"></span>[1](#fn_626.md) or in the sixteen
principal countries (in them) <span id="fr_636"></span>[2](#fn_627.md) he
stayed, there, as a usual thing, two, three, four, or five hundred, or a
thousand, or a hundred thousand, both gods and men, saw face to face the
calm, the supreme good, Nirvâ*n*a. And all of those who were gods, O
king, were laymen. They had not entered the Order. So these and many
other billions of gods, O king,--even while they were yet laymen, living
at home, enjoying the pleasures of sense,--saw face to face (realised in
themselves) the condition of Peace, the Supreme Good, Nirvâ*n*a <span
id="fr_637"></span>[3](#fn_628.md).'

5\. 'If so, venerable Nâgasena,--if laymen, living at home and enjoying
the pleasures of sense, can see Nirvâ*n*a,--what purpose then do these
extra vows serve? That being so, rather must \[**351**\] the vows be
workers of mischief. For, Nâgasena, if diseases would abate without
medicine, what would be the advantage of weakening the body by emetics,
by purges, and other like remedies?--if one's enemies could be subdued
with one's fists only, where would be the need of swords and spears, of
javelins and bows and cross-bows, of maces and of clubs?--if trees could
be climbed by clambering up them with the aid of the knots and of the
crooked and hollow places in them, of the thorny excrescences and
creepers and branches growing on them, what would be the need of going
in quest of ladders long and strong?--if sleeping on the bare ground
gave

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

ease to the limbs <span id="fr_638"></span>[1](#fn_629.md), why should one
seek after fine large beds, soft to the touch?--if one could cross the
desert alone, inaccessible though it be, and full of danger and fear,
why need one wait for a grand caravan, well armed and well equipped?--if
a man were able by his own arms to cross a flowing river, what need he
care for firm dykes or boats?--if he could provide board and lodging for
himself out of his own property, why should he trouble to do service to
others, to flatter with sweet words, to run to and fro?--when he can get
water from a natural pool, why should he dig wells and tanks and
artificial ponds? And just so, venerable Nâgasena, if laymen, living at
home and enjoying the pleasures of sense, can realise in themselves the
condition of Peace, the Supreme Good, Nirvâ*n*a, what is the need of
taking upon oneself these vows?'

6\. 'There are, O king, these twenty-eight good qualities in the vows,
virtues really inherent in them; and on account of these all the Buddhas
alike have longed for them and held them dear. And what are the
twenty-eight? The keeping of the vows, O king, implies a mode of
livelihood without evil, it has a blissful calm as its fruit, it avoids
blame, it works no harm to others, it is free from danger, it brings no
trouble on others, it is certain to bring with it growth in goodness, it
wastes not away, it deludes not, it is in itself a protection <span
id="fr_639"></span>[2](#fn_630.md), it works the satisfaction of desires
and the taming of all beings, it is good for self-control,

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

it is appropriate <span id="fr_640"></span>[1](#fn_631.md), (he who keeps
the vows) is self-dependent <span id="fr_641"></span>[2](#fn_632.md), is
emancipated <span id="fr_642"></span>[3](#fn_633.md), the keeping of them
is the destruction of lust; and of malice, and of dullness; it is the
pulling away of pride, the cutting off of evil thoughts, the removal of
doubts, the suppression of sloth, the putting away of discontent; it is
long-suffering, its merit is beyond weight, and its virtue beyond
measure, and it is the path that leads to the end of every grief. These,
O king, are the twenty-eight good qualities in the vows; \[**352**\] and
it is on account of these that all the Buddhas alike have longed for
them and held them dear.

7\. 'And whosoever, O king, thoroughly carry out the vows, they become
completely endowed with eighteen good qualities. What are these
eighteen? Their walk is pure, their path is accomplished, well guarded
are they in deed and word, altogether pure are they in manners and in
mind, their zeal flags not, all their fears are allayed, all delusions
(as to the permanence and as to the degree) of their individuality have
been put away, anger has died away while love (to all beings) <span
id="fr_643"></span>[4](#fn_634.md) has arisen in their hearts, in taking
nourishment they eat it with the three right views regarding food <span
id="fr_644"></span>[5](#fn_635.md), they are honoured of

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

all men, they are temperate in eating, they are full of watchfulness,
they need no home, wheresoever is a pleasant spot there do they dwell,
they loathe to do ill, they take delight in solitude, they are in
earnest always. These, O king, are the good qualities with which they
who carry out the vows are completely endowed.

8\. 'And these ten, O king, are the individuals worthy of those
advantages inherent in the vows--the man full of faith, ashamed to do
wrong, full of courage, void of hypocrisy, master of himself, not
unstable <span id="fr_645"></span>[1](#fn_636.md), desirous to learn, glad
to undertake the task that is hard, not easy to take offence, of a
loving heart. These, O king, are the ten individuals worthy of those
advantages inherent in the vows.

9\. 'And all they, O king, who as laymen, living at home and in the
enjoyment of the pleasures of sense, realise in themselves the condition
of Peace, the Supreme Good, Nirvâ*n*a,--all they had in former births
accomplished their training, laid the foundation, in the practice of the
thirteen vows, had purified their walk and conduct by means of them; and
so now, even as laymen, living at home and in the enjoyment of the
pleasures of sense, do they realise in themselves the condition of
Peace, the Supreme Good, Nirvâ*n*a. Just, O king, as a clever archer
first in regular succession teaches his pupils at the training ground
the different kinds of bows, the manner of holding the bow up, and of
keeping it in a firm grasp, and of bending the fingers, and of planting
the feet, and of taking up the arrow, and of placing it on

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

the string, and of drawing it back, and of restraining it, and of aiming
at the mark, and thus of hitting <span id="fr_646"></span>[1](#fn_637.md) a
man of straw, or targets made of the *Kh*a*n*aka plant <span
id="fr_647"></span>[2](#fn_638.md), or of grass, or of straw, or of masses
of clay, or of shields <span id="fr_648"></span>[3](#fn_639.md)--and after
that, introducing them to the service of the king, he gains the reward
of high-bred chargers and chariots and elephants and horses and money
and corn and red gold and slave girls and slaves and wives and lands.
\[**353**\] Just so, O king, all they who as laymen, living at home in
the enjoyment of the pleasures of sense, realise in themselves the
condition of Peace, the Supreme Good, Nirvâ*n*a,--all they had in former
births accomplished their training, laid the foundation, in the practice
of the thirteen vows, had purified their walk and conduct by means of
them; and so now, even as laymen, and living at home in the enjoyment of
the pleasures of sense, do they realise in themselves the condition of
Peace, the Supreme Good, Nirvâ*n*a.

10\. 'And there is no realisation of Arahatship, O king, in one single
life, without a previous keeping of the vows. Only on the utmost zeal
and the most devoted practice of righteousness, and with the aid of a
suitable teacher, is the realisation of Arahatship attained. just, O
king, as a doctor or surgeon first procures for himself a teacher,
either by the payment of a fee or by the performance of service, and
then

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

thoroughly trains himself in holding the lancet, in cutting, marking, or
piercing with it, in extracting darts, in cleansing wounds, in causing
them to dry up, in the application of ointments, in the administration
of emetics and purges and oily enemas, and only when he has thus gone
through training, served his apprenticeship, made himself skilful, does
he visit the sick to heal them. Just so, O king, all they who as laymen,
living at home in the enjoyment of the pleasures of sense, realise in
themselves the condition of Peace, the Supreme Good, Nirvâ*n*a,--all
they had in former births accomplished their training, laid the
foundation, in the practice of the thirteen vows, had purified their
walk and conduct by means of them; and so now, even as laymen, and
living at home in the enjoyment of the pleasures of sense, do they
realise in themselves the condition of Peace, the Supreme Good,
Nirvâ*n*a.

11\. 'And there is no perception of the truth to those who are not
purified by the virtues that depend on the keeping of the vows. just as
without water no seed will grow, so can there be no perception of the
truth to those not purified by the practice of the vows. just as there
is no rebirth in bliss to those who have done no meritorious actions, no
beautiful deeds, so is there no perception of the truth for those not
purified by the practice of the vows.

12\. 'Like the broad earth, O king, is the character resulting from the
keeping of the vows, to serve as a basis to those who desire to be
pure <span id="fr_649"></span>[1](#fn_640.md). Like water is it, O king, to
wash away the stain of all things

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

evil in those who desire to be pure. Like the fire is it, O king, to
burn out the lust of all evil in those who desire to be pure
\[**354**\]. Like the wind is it, O king, to carry away the dust of all
evil in those desiring to be pure. Like medicine is it, O king, to allay
the disease of evil in those desiring to be pure. Like ambrosia is it, O
king, to act as an antidote to the poison of evil in those desiring to
be pure. Like arable land is it, O king, on which to grow the crop of
'all the virtues of renunciation to those desiring to be pure. Like a
wishing-gem <span id="fr_650"></span>[1](#fn_641.md) is it, O king; for
conferring all the high attainments they long and crave for upon those
who desire to be pure. Like a boat is it, O king, for carrying to the
further shore of the mighty ocean of transmigration all those who desire
to be pure. Like a place of refuge is it, O king, where those who desire
to be pure can be safe from the fear of old age and death. Like a mother
is it, O king, to comfort those who desire to be pure when afflicted
with the sorrows of sin. Like a father is it, O king, to raise up in
those who desire to be pure and to increase in goodness all the good
qualities of those who have renounced the world. Like a friend is it, O
king, in not disappointing those who desire to be pure in their search
after the good qualities of those who have renounced the world. Like a
lotus flower, O king, is it, in not being tarnished by the stain of
evil. Like costly perfume (of saffron and of jasmine and the Turkish
incense and the Greek) <span id="fr_651"></span>[2](#fn_642.md)

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

is it, O king, for counteracting the bad odour of evil for those who
desire to be pure. Like a lofty mountain range is it, O king, for
protecting those who desire to be pure from the onslaught of the winds
of the eight conditions to which men are subject in this world (gain and
loss, and fame and dishonour, and praise and blame, and happiness and
woe) <span id="fr_652"></span>[1](#fn_643.md). Like the space of heaven is
it, O king, in the freedom from all obstruction, in the magnitude, in
the great expanse and breadth it gives to those who desire to be pure.
Like a stream is it, O king, in washing away for those who desire to be
pure the stain of all evil. Like a guide is it, O king, in bringing safe
out of the desert of rebirths, out of the jungle of lusts and sins,
those who desire to be pure. Like a mighty caravan is it, O king, for
bringing those who desire to be pure safe into that most blessed city of
Nirvâ*n*a, peaceful and calm, where no fear dwells, \[**355**\] Like a
well-polished spotless mirror is it, O king, for showing to those who
desire to be pure the true nature of the constituent elements of all
beings. Like a shield is it, O king, for warding off from those who
desire to be pure the clubs and the arrows and the swords of evil
dispositions. Like a sunshade is it, O king, for warding off from those
who desire to be pure the scorching heat of the threefold fire <span
id="fr_653"></span>[2](#fn_644.md). Like

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

the moon is it, O king, as being longed and hoped for by those who
desire to be pure. Like the sun is it, O king, as dispelling the
blackness of the darkness of ignorance for those who desire to be pure.
Like the ocean is it, O king, as causing to arise in those desiring to
be pure the costly treasures of the virtues of those who have renounced
the world, and by reason too of its immensity, of its being beyond
measure and beyond count,

13\. 'Thus is it, O king, of great service to those desiring to be pure,
a remover of all sorrow and lamentation, an antidote to discontent; it
puts an end to fear, and individuality, and imperviousness of mind; to
evil, and to grief, and to pain, and to lust, and to malice, and to
dullness, and to pride, and to heresy, and to all wrong dispositions; it
brings with it honour and advantage and bliss; it fills them with ease
and with love and with peace of mind; it is free from blame; it has
happiness here as its fruit; it is a mine and treasure of goodness that
is beyond measure and beyond count, costly above all things, and
precious.

14\. 'Just, O king, as men for nourishment seek after food, for health
medicine, for assistance a friend, for crossing water a boat, for
pleasant odours a perfume, for security a place of refuge, for support
the earth, for instruction a teacher, for honours a king, and for
whatever they desire a wishing-gem--just so, O king, do the Arahats seek
after the virtues of the keeping of the vows for the attainment of all
the advantages of renunciation of the world.

15\. 'And what water is for the growth of seeds, \[**356**\] what fire
is for burning, what food is for giving strength, what a creeper is for
tying things up, what

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

a sword is for cutting, what water is for allaying thirst, what a
treasure is for giving confidence, what a boat is for crossing to the
further shore, what medicine is for allaying disease, what a carriage is
for journeying at ease, what a place of refuge is for appeasing fear,
what a king is for protection, what a shield is for warding off the
blows of sticks and stakes, of clubs, of arrows, and of darts, what a
teacher is for instruction, what a mother is for nourishing, what a
mirror is for seeing, what a jewel is for ornament, what a dress is for
clothing, what a ladder is for mounting up, what a pair of scales is for
comparison <span id="fr_654"></span>[1](#fn_645.md), what a charm is for
repetition, what a weapon is for warding off scorn, what a lamp is for
dissipating darkness, what a breeze is for allaying fever, what
knowledge of an art is for the accomplishment of business, what
medicinal drugs are for the preservation of life, what a mine is for the
production of jewels, what a gem is for ornament, what a command is for
preventing transgression, what sovranty is for dominion--all that, O
king, is the character-that-comes-of-keeping-the-vows for the good
growth of the seed of renunciation, for the burning out of the stains of
evil, for giving the strength of Iddhi, for tying up one's self in
self-control and presence of mind, for the complete cutting off of doubt
and mistrust, for allaying the thirst of craving, for giving confidence
as to perception of the truth, for crossing to the further shore of the
fourfold stream (of sensuality, individuality, delusion, and ignorance),
for allaying the disease of evil dispositions,

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

for attaining to the bliss of Nirvâ*n*a, for appeasing the fears that
arise from birth, old age, decay and death, grief, pain, lamentation,
woe, and despair, for being protected in the possession of the
advantages of renunciation, for warding off discontent and evil
thoughts, for instruction in all the good involved in the life of those
who have renounced the world, for nourishment therein, for explaining to
men quietude and insight, and the path and the fruits thereof and
Nirvâ*n*a, for bestowing upon men a costly ornament high in the praise
and admiration of the world, for closing the doors of all evil states,
for mounting up to the peaks of the mountain heights of renunciation,
for distinguishing crooked and cunning and evil intentions in others,
for the proper recitation of those qualities which ought to be practised
and those which ought not, for warding off as one's enemies all evil
dispositions, for dissipating the darkness of ignorance, for allaying
the fever arising from the scorching of the threefold fire, for the
accomplishment of the attainment of the Condition of Peace--so gentle
and so subtle,--for the protection of the virtues of the life of a
recluse, for the production of the precious jewels of the sevenfold
wisdom--self-possession, investigation of the truth, energy, joy, calm
contemplation, and serenity,--for the adornment of the recluses, for the
prevention of any transgression against that blameless, abstruse,
delicate bliss \[**357**\] that comes of peace, for dominion over all
the qualities that recluses and Arahats affect. Thus, O king, is it that
keeping the vows is one and the same thing as attaining to all these
qualities. And the advantage thereof, O king, cannot be weighed, neither
measured; it has no equal, no rival, no

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

superior, great is it and glorious, extensive and abundant, deep and
broad, and large and wide, full of weight and worth and might.

16\. 'And whosoever, O king, having evil cravings in his heart, being
hypocritical, greedy, a slave to his stomach <span
id="fr_655"></span>[1](#fn_646.md), seeking after material gain or worldly
fame and glory, unfit (for the outward signs of Arahatship), not having
reached the attainments, whose conduct is inconsistent (with membership
in the Order), unworthy of it, inappropriate to it--whosoever being such
shall take upon himself the vows, he shall incur a twofold punishment,
suffering the loss of the good that may be in him. For in this world he
shall receive disgrace, and scorn <span id="fr_656"></span>[2](#fn_647.md),
and blame, and ridicule, and suspension, and excommunication <span
id="fr_657"></span>[3](#fn_648.md), and expulsion, and he shall be outcast,
rejected, dismissed; and in his next life he shall suffer torment in the
great Avî*k*i purgatory that is a hundred leagues in depth, and covered,
as with a garland, with hot and scorching, fierce and fiery blazing
flames; therein shall he rise and fall for myriads of years, upwards and
downwards and across,--a foam-bubble, as it were, cast up and thrown
from side to side in a boiling sea <span
id="fr_658"></span>[4](#fn_649.md). And, when released from thence, then as
a mighty Preta (ghost), in the outward form of a monk, but with

never cease, with no place of refuge to fly to, no protector to help
him, groaning and weeping and crying out for mercy, shall he wander
wailing o'er the earth!

17\. 'Just, O king, as whosoever, being unfit for royalty, without
having properly attained to it, being inappropriate to it, unworthy of
it, unsuitable for it, a low-born man and base in lineage, should
receive the consecration of a king, he would suffer mutilation, having
his hands or his feet, or his hands and feet cut off, or his ears or his
nose, or his ears and nose cut off, \[**358**\] or he would be tortured,
being subjected to the Gruel Pot, or to the Chank Crown, or to the
Râhu's Mouth, or to the Fire Garland, or to the Hand Torch, or to the
Snake Strips, or to the Bark Dress, or to the Spotted Antelope, or to
the Flesh Hooks, or to the Pennies, or to the Brine Slits, or to the Bar
Turn, or to the Straw Seat <span id="fr_661"></span>[3](#fn_652.md), or he
would be anointed with boiling oil, or be eaten by dogs, or be impaled
alive, or be beheaded, or be subjected to punishments of various kinds.
And why? Because he being unfit for it, without having properly attained
to it, being inappropriate to it, unworthy of it, unsuitable for it, a
low-born man

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

and base in lineage, he had placed himself in the seat of sovranty, and
thus transgressed beyond his right limits. Just so, O king, whosoever
having evil cravings in his heart, being hypocritical, greedy, a slave
to his stomach, seeking after material gain or worldly fame and glory,
unfit (for the outward signs of Arahatship), not having reached the
attainments, whose conduct is inconsistent (with membership in the
Order), unworthy of it, inappropriate to it--whosoever being such shall
take upon himself the vows, he shall incur a twofold punishment,
suffering the loss of the good that may be in him. For in this world he
shall receive disgrace, and scorn, and blame, and ridicule, and
suspension, and excommunication, and expulsion, and he shall be outcast,
rejected, dismissed; and in his next life he shall suffer torment in the
great Avî*k*i purgatory that is a hundred leagues in depth, and covered,
as with a garland, with hot and scorching, fierce and fiery blazing
flames; therein shall he rise and fall for myriads of years, upwards and
downwards and across,--a foam-bubble, as it were, cast up and thrown
from side to side in a boiling sea. And, when released from thence, then
as a mighty Preta (ghost), in the outward form of a monk, but with body
and limbs lean and rugged and dark, with head swollen, bloated, and full
of holes, hungry and thirsty, odd and dreadful in colour and form, his
cars all torn, and his eyes ever winking, his limbs a mass of mortifying
sores, his whole body the prey of maggots, his stomach all scorching and
hot like a fiery furnace blazing in the breeze, yet with a mouth no
larger than a needle so that his thirst can never cease, with no place
of refuge to fly

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

to, no protector to help him, groaning and weeping and crying out for
mercy, shall he wander wailing o'er the earth!

18\. 'But whosoever, O king, is fit, who has reached the attainments,
whose conduct is consistent with membership in the Order, who is worthy
of it, appropriate to it, who desires little and is content, given to
seclusion, not fond of society, alert in zeal, resolute of heart,
without guile, without deceit, not a slave to his stomach, seeking
neither material gain nor worldly fame or glory, full of faith, who has
entered the Order from belief (in the doctrine, and not from worldly
motives), and is full of desire for release from old age and
death--whosoever being such shall take upon himself the vows with the
idea of upholding the faith, he is deserving of twofold honour. For he
is near and dear to, loved and longed for by both gods and men, dear as
rare jasmine flowers to the man bathed and anointed, as sweet food to
the hungry, as cool, clear, fragrant water to the thirsty, as a healing
drug to a poisoned man, as a costly chariot drawn by high-bred steeds to
the hurrying traveller, as a wishing-gem to the greedy for gain, as the
pure white sunshade of sovranty to one ambitious for a throne, as the
blessed attainment of the fruits of Arahatship to the seeker after
holiness. It is he who attains to the fullest mastery over the four
Earnest Meditations, the fourfold Great Struggle, the four Roads to
Saintship, the five Organs of the moral sense, the five moral Powers,
the seven forms of Wisdom, and the Noble Eightfold Path <span

he, and over him is borne the pure white sunshade of emancipation!

19\. 'Just, O king, as all the citizens and country folk in the land,
the soldiers and the peons (royal messengers), wait in service upon a
Kshatriya king, born to the purple, and on both sides of lineage high,
when he has been consecrated with the inauguration ceremonies of the
Kshatriyas <span id="fr_667"></span>[5](#fn_658.md); the thirty-eight

as to the fate of every foreigner and criminal <span

has reached the attainments, whose conduct is consistent with membership
in the Order, who is worthy of it, appropriate to it, who desires little
and is content, given to seclusion, not fond of society, alert in zeal,
resolute of heart, without guile, without deceit, not a slave to his

of faith, who has entered the Order from belief (in the doctrine, and

age and

death--whosoever being such shall take upon himself the vows with the
idea of upholding the faith, he is deserving of twofold honour. For he
is near and dear to, loved and longed for by both gods and men, dear as
rare jasmine flowers to the man bathed and anointed, as sweet food to

Discrimination, the threefold Knowledge, the sixfold higher Wisdom, in a
word, the whole religion of the recluses becomes his very own, an
anointed king is he, and over him is borne the pure white sunshade of
emancipation!

20\. 'Such, O king, are the thirteen vows purified by which a man shall
bathe in the mighty waters of Nirvâ*n*a, and there indulge himself, as
one sporting in the waves, with the manifold delights of religion, he
shall addict himself to the eight modes of transcendental ecstacy, he
shall acquire the powers of Iddhi, distant sounds, human and divine,
shall greet his ear, he shall divine the thoughts of others, he

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

shall be able to call to mind his own previous births, and to watch the
rise and fall from birth to birth of others, and he shall perceive the
real nature and the origin of, he shall perceive the means of escape
from sorrow, and from lust, individuality, delusion, and ignorance, the
stains of life!

'And what are these thirteen? Wearing raiment made up of pieces taken
from a dust-heap--Wearing three robes, and three robes only--Living on
food received by begging--Begging straight on from house to
house--Eating only once a day, at one sitting--Eating from one vessel
only--Refusing food in excess of the regulations--Dwelling in the
woods--Dwelling at the root of a tree-Dwelling in the open air--Dwelling
in or near a cemetery--Not altering the mat or bed when it has once been
spread out to sleep on--and sleeping in a sitting posture. It is he, O
king, who, in former births, has undertaken and practised, followed and
carried out, observed, framed his conduct according to, and fulfilled
these thirteen vows, who acquires all the results of the life of a
recluse, and all its ecstacy of peace and bliss becomes his very
own <span id="fr_672"></span>[1](#fn_663.md).

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

21\. 'Just, O king, as a shipowner who has become wealthy by constantly
levying freight in some seaport town, will be able to traverse the high
seas, and go to Vanga, or Takkola, or China, or Sovîra, or Surat, or
Alexandria, or the Koromandel coast, or Further India, or any other
place where ships do congregate--just so, O king, \[**360**\] it is he
who in former births has undertaken and practised, followed and carried
out, observed, framed his conduct according to, and fulfilled these
thirteen vows, who acquires all the results of the life of a recluse,
and all its ecstacy of peace and bliss becomes his very own.

22\. 'And just, O king, as a husbandman will first remove the defects in
the soil-weeds, and thorns, and stones-arid then by ploughing, and
sowing,

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

and irrigating, and fencing, and watching, and reaping, and grinding,
will become the owner of much flour, and so the lord of whosoever are
poor and needy, reduced to beggary and misery--just so, O king, it is he
who in former births has undertaken and practised, followed and carried
out, observed, framed his conduct according to, and fulfilled these
thirteen vows, who acquires all the results of the life of a recluse,
and all its ecstacy of peace and bliss becomes his very own.

23\. 'And again, O king, just as an anointed monarch is master over the
treatment of outlaws, is an independent ruler and lord, and does
whatsoever he desires, and all the broad earth is subject to him--just
so, O king, is he who has undertaken, practised, and fulfilled in former
births these vows, master, ruler, and lord in the religion of the
Conquerors, and all the virtues of the Samanas are his.

24\. 'And was not Upasena, the Elder, he of the sons of the
Vangantas <span id="fr_673"></span>[1](#fn_664.md), from his having
thoroughly practised all the purifying merits of the vows, able to
neglect the agreement arrived at by the members of the Order resident at
Sâvatthi, and to visit with his attendant brethren the Subduer of men,
then retired into solitude, and when he had bowed down before him, to
take his scat respectfully aside? And when the Blessed One saw how well
trained his retinue was, then, delighted and glad and exalted in heart,
he greeted them with courteous words, and said in his unbroken beautiful
voice:

Most pleasant, Upasena, is the deportment of

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

these brethren waiting upon you. How have you managed thus to train your
followers?"

'And he, when so questioned by the omniscient Buddha, the god over all
gods, spake thus to the Blessed One as to the real reason for the
goodness of their nature: "Whosoever, Lord, may come to me to ask for
admission to the Order or to become my disciple, to him do I say
\[**361**\]: 'I, Sir, am a frequenter of the woods, who gain my food by
begging, and wear but this robe pieced together from cast-off rags. If
you will be the same, I can admit you to the Order and make you my
disciple.' Then, if he agree thereto with joy, and abase himself <span
id="fr_674"></span>[1](#fn_665.md), I thereupon admit him to the Order and
to the company of my pupils. But if not, then neither do I admit him to
the one nor to the other. Thus is it, Lord, that I train them <span
id="fr_675"></span>[2](#fn_666.md)." And thus is it, O king, that he who
has taken upon himself the vows becomes master, ruler, and lord in the
religion of the Conquerors; and all its ecstacy of peace and bliss
becomes his very own.

25\. 'Just, O king, as a lotus flower of glorious, pure, and high
descent and origin is glossy, soft, desirable, sweet-smelling, longed
for, loved, and praised, untarnished by the water or the mud, graced
with tiny petals and filaments and pericarps, the resort of many bees, a
child of the clear cold

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

stream--just so is that disciple of the Noble Ones who in former births
has undertaken and practised, followed and carried out, observed and
framed his conduct according to, and fulfilled these thirteen vows,
endowed with the thirty graces. And what are the thirty? His heart is
full of affectionate, soft, and tender love, evil is killed, destroyed,
cast out from within him, pride and self-righteousness are put an end to
and cast down, stable and strong and established and undeviating is his
faith, he enters into the enjoyment of the heart's refreshment, the
highly praised and desirable peace and bliss of the ecstacies of
contemplation fully felt, he exhales the most excellent and unequalled
sweet savour of righteousness of life, near is he and dear to gods and
men alike, exalted by the best of beings the Arahat Noble Ones
themselves, gods and men delight to honour him, the enlightened, wise,
and learned approve, esteem, appreciate, and praise him, untarnished is
he by the love either of this world or the next <span
id="fr_676"></span>[1](#fn_667.md), he sees the danger in the smallest
tiniest offence, rich is he in the best of wealth--the wealth that is
the fruit of the Path, the wealth of those who are seeking the highest
of the attainments,--he is partaker of the best of the four requisites
of a recluse that may be obtained by asking, he lives without a home
addicted to that best austerity that is dependent on the meditation of
the *Gh*ânas, \[**362**\] he has unravelled the whole net of evil, he
has broken and burst through, doubled up and utterly destroyed both the
possibility of rebirth in any of the five future states, and the five
obstacles to the

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

higher life in this one (lust, malice, sloth, pride, and doubt),
unalterable in character, excellent in conduct <span
id="fr_677"></span>[1](#fn_668.md), transgressing none of the rules as to
the four requisites of a recluse, he is set free from rebirths, he has
passed beyond all perplexity, his mind is set upon complete
emancipation, he has seen the truth <span
id="fr_678"></span>[2](#fn_669.md), the sure and stedfast place of refuge
from all fear has he gained, the seven evil inclinations (to lust, and
malice, and heresy, and doubt, and pride, and desire for future life,
and ignorance) are rooted out in him, he has reached the end of the
Great Evils (lust, individuality, delusion, and ignorance), he abounds
in the peace and the bliss of the ecstacies of contemplation, he is
endowed with all the virtues a recluse should have. These, O king, are
the thirty graces he is adorned withal.

26\. 'And was not Sâriputta, the Elder, O king, the best man in the
whole ten thousand world systems, the Teacher of the world himself alone
excepted? And he who through endless ages had heaped up merit, and had
been reborn in a Brahman family, relinquished all the delights of the
pleasures of sense, and gave up boundless wealth <span
id="fr_679"></span>[3](#fn_670.md), to enter the Order according to the
teaching of the Conqueror, and having restrained his actions, words, and
thoughts by these thirteen vows, became in this life of such exalted
virtue that he was the one who, after the Master, set rolling on the
royal chariot-wheel

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

of the kingdom of righteousness in the religion of Gotama, the Blessed
One. So that this was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all
gods, in that most excellent collection, the A<u>n</u>guttara
Nikâya <span id="fr_680"></span>[1](#fn_671.md):

"I know, O brethren, of no other man who in succession to me sets
rolling on the glorious chariot-wheel of the kingdom of righteousness so
well as Sâriputta. Sâriputta, O brethren, sets rolling that wheel the
best of all."'

'Most excellent, Nâgasena! The whole ninefold word of the Buddha, the
most exalted conduct, the highest and best of the attainments to be
gained in the world,--all these are wrapped up together in the virtues
that result from the keeping of the vows.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_597"></span>[244:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_600.md) 'Standing in the
Fruit of the Anâgâmins.' So they had already reached the third stage in
the Excellent Way.

<span id="fn_598"></span>[245:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_601.md) I take this to
mean, 'Not to speak of comparatively small numbers who have experienced
Abhisamaya, an innumerable host of laymen have reached Nirvâ*n*a--that
is, have reached, and during their lives remained in, the third stage of
the Path, and attained Arahatship just before they died. Abhisamaya is
used either absolutely or in composition. Mânâbhisamaya (A. IV, 38, 5 =
M. I, 12) certainly, and perhaps Atthâbhisamaya, is used of Arahats, but
they do not occur in our author. He uses occasionally Dhammâbhisamaya
(see pp. 255, 350, &c., of the Pâli) and *K*atu-sa*kk*âbhisamaya (see
pp. 171, 334, &c.), but more frequently Abhisamaya absolutely.
Dhammâbhisamaya, 'penetration into, clear understanding of, the Dhammas
or Dhamma,' may refer to the four Dhammas of A<u>n</u>guttara IV, i (=
M. P. S., IV, 2, 3), or to the comprehension of the qualities (Dhammas)
of things, or (what is very much the same) to the comprehension of the
principal doctrine (Dhamma) of the impermanence of all things. In the
last case it would be the same thing, looked at from a slightly
different point of view, as the Dhamma-*k*akkhu, the Eye for the Truths
(see Suma<u>n</u>gala Vilâsinî I, 237), or as that insight (Vipassanâ)
which is the entrance to the Path. But the four Truths (as to sorrow,
&c.) are also important Dhammas, and as the expression
Katu-sa*kk*âbhisamaya clearly refers to them and them only, this may
also be the meaning of dhammâbhisamaya, or at any rate of abhisamaya
standing above. So at least I take the latter here. We know that the
'Eye for the Dhamma,' the perception of the first only of the tî*n*i
lakkha*n*âni (impermanence), implies and involves the entrance into the
Path. Oddly enough there is as yet no evidence to show whether the
perception of the cardinal doctrine of the four Truths necessarily does
so too; or can do so alone, without the Dhamma*k*akkhu. If the latter,
then there are two gates to the Path. And this is not only quite
possible, but is the inference one might fairly draw from the constant
phrase 'After the exposition of the Truths had concluded so and so
attained to' one or other of the phalâni.

<span id="fn_599"></span>[246:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_602.md) Literally 'shall I
give you anuyoga,' which the Si*m*halese renders 'opportunity for
speech'(!). Above, at p. 10 of the Pâli, the rendering is quite
different, 'pâ*d*am dî samuge*n*a.' The only translation that fits the
context in both of these places (the only ones in which the idiom has,
so far, been found) is 'lay before you (proofs of my) mastery (over the
subject),' or something of that sort. It is a disappointing satisfaction
to find that the phrase was as unintelligible in Ceylon as it is to us.
In my version above I should now prefer to write instead of 'repeated
his lesson to his teacher for the last time,' 'gave his teacher proofs
that he had understood what he had taught him.'

<span id="fn_630"></span>[251:2](sbe3608.htm#fr_639.md) Hîna*t*i-kumburê,
p. 512, takes ârakkhâ-patthitadada*m* as one compound.

<span id="fn_631"></span>[252:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_640.md) Pa*t*irûpam,
probably 'to the life of a recluse,' but the Si*m*halese takes it to
mean 'to the doctrine' (sâsana).

<span id="fn_632"></span>[252:2](sbe3608.htm#fr_641.md) Anissita*m*. See
the note above on the translation of p. 321 of the Pâli. 'Independent of
craving' (t*ri*sh*n*â), says the Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_633"></span>[252:3](sbe3608.htm#fr_642.md) Vippamutta*m*. Of
t*ri*sh*n*â, says the Si*m*halese again.

<span id="fn_634"></span>[252:4](sbe3608.htm#fr_643.md) Mettâ, which always
has the connotation. Hîna*t*i-kumburê accordingly renders it
sakala-satwayan kerehi maitreya.

<span id="fn_635"></span>[252:5](sbe3608.htm#fr_644.md) Âhâro pari*ññ*âto.
The three right views are, 1 as to its nature, 2 as to its impurity, 3
as to the lust of taste.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[253:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_645.md) Alolo, 'not greedy
after the four requisites of a recluse,' says the Si*m*halese, p. 514.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[254:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_646.md) Vedhe. I follow Mr.
Trenckner, but the Si*m*halese translation is based on the reading Vede.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[254:2](sbe3608.htm#fr_647.md) The Si*m*halese
takes this word in composition with the following ti*n*a and spells it
*G*anakaya. Compare *K*a*n*aka, 'a chick pea.'

<span id="fn_639"></span>[254:3](sbe3608.htm#fr_648.md) Phalaka. But
Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 514, takes it in the technical sense of a kind of
rough roller, made of the wood apple tree (dimbul porû), and used for
levelling rice-fields.

<span id="fn_640"></span>[255:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_649.md) Visuddhi-kâmânam,
which Hîna*t*i-kumburê characteristically renders, 'who desire to attain
to Nirvâ*n*a' (p. 516).

<span id="fn_641"></span>[256:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_650.md) Manoharo. Childers
does not give this meaning to the word, but it is confirmed by the
passages above and below, pp. 118, 358 of the Pâli, and by the
Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[256:2](sbe3608.htm#fr_651.md)
*K*atu-*g*âtiya-gandho. The two last are Yavana and Tarukkha.
Böhtlingk-Roth explain both as Olibanum. Our <span id="page_257">p.
257</span> author does not give the details, but it is unlikely that he
meant other perfumes than those usually comprised in the term 'perfume
of four kinds.' The expression is not found in the Pi*t*akas, though it
occurs in Buddhaghosa; and its use by our author may help to settle his
date when we know its history, and the exact composition of the two
foreign perfumes it includes.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[257:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_652.md) The eight
Loka-dhammas.

<span id="fn_644"></span>[257:2](sbe3608.htm#fr_653.md) That is, of lust,
malice, and dullness--that fire the 'going out' of which (in one's
heart) is Nirvâ*n*a.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[259:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_654.md) Nikkhepana; not in
Childers, but compare Sa*m*yutta Nikâya XX, 22, 6.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[261:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_655.md) Odarika; not in
Childers, and only found as yet at this, passage and at the Thera Gâthâ,
verse 101. It is the Sanskrit: audarika. 'Who enters the Order for the
sake of his stomach' says the Si*m*halese, p. 521.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[261:2](sbe3608.htm#fr_656.md) Khî*l*ana*m*.
Compare khî*l*ito above, pp. 229, 288 of the Pâli.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[261:3](sbe3608.htm#fr_657.md) Compare the rules
at *K*ullavagga I, 25, 1, &c.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[261:4](sbe3608.htm#fr_658.md) On
Phe*n*-uddehaka*m* compare *G*âtaka III, 46; on samparivattaka*m* above,
p. 253 of the Pâli.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[262:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_659) Sûna (for *s*ûna.md).
See *K*ullavagga X, 1, 2, 3.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[262:2](sbe3608.htm#fr_660.md) Aru-gatto
pakka-gatto. See Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya I, 506.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[262:3](sbe3608.htm#fr_661.md) On all these see
the notes above, I, 276, 277.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[264:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_662.md) For the details of
these constituent elements of Arahatship, see my note in 'Buddhist
Suttas,' pp. 60-63.

<span id="fn_654"></span>[265:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_663.md) These are the four
stages of the path to Arahatship.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[265:2](sbe3608.htm#fr_664.md) Pa*t*isambhidâ--in
worldly things, and in religion, in intuitive knowledge, and in
exposition.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[265:3](sbe3608.htm#fr_665.md) Tisso Vi*gg*â. One
explanation of this term is the knowledge of the three limitations of
individuality,--its impermanence, the pain involved in the struggle to
maintain it, and the absence of any permanent principle (any soul) in
any individual. But it is also explained in the A<u>n</u>guttara Nikâya
III, 58, as meaning the knowledge firstly of one's own former births,
secondly of other people's former births, and thirdly of the nature, the
origin, and the right method of subduing sorrow and the âsavas (that is,
lust, individuality, delusion, and ignorance). The first triplet is
identical with the three lakkha*n*as, the second with the last three of
the Dasabalas, the ten powers of a Buddha. So in the Sutta
Vibha<u>n</u>ga (Pârâ*g*ika I, 1-8) the last of these three is called
tatiyâ vi*gg*a. Compare also 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 162.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[265:4](sbe3608.htm#fr_666.md) The Abhi*ññ*âs.

<span id="fn_658"></span>[265:5](sbe3608.htm#fr_667.md) Some details of
this are given in the Si*m*halese, p. 524.

<span id="fn_659"></span>[265:6](sbe3608.htm#fr_668.md) Mukha-mangalikâ,
which the Si*m*halese repeats, and which apparently means 'panegyrists.'
The exact connotation of both these terms has yet to be settled.
So*tth*i vâ*k*â*k*â may correspond with the people who throw rice after
a departing wedding pair; <span id="page_266">p. 266</span> and
Mukha-ma<u>n</u>galikâ may be those who prophesy the lucky days on which
a thing is to be commenced. But this is the only passage in which the
phrases occur in Pâli, and in Sanskrit we have only much later
authorities. See the Commentary on *S*akuntalâ, quoted in the note on p.
152 of Sir M. Monier-Williams's edition, and Wilson's explanation in his
Sanskrit Dictionary of swasti-va*k*ânâ.

<span id="fn_660"></span>[266:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_669.md) Sotthi-vâ*k*akâ,
'utterers of blessing.' The Si*m*halese has sôbhana-vâ*k*anikayo
(perhaps 'augurs').

<span id="fn_661"></span>[266:2](sbe3608.htm#fr_670.md)
Sû<u>n</u>ka*tth*âna, 'taxing-place.' But the Si*m*halese, p. 524, has
only samasthâna.

<span id="fn_662"></span>[266:3](sbe3608.htm#fr_671.md) I can only guess at
the meaning of this enigmatical phrase, which the Si*m*halese again
merely repeats, but a precisely similar passage occurs in the
Suma<u>n</u>gala Vilâsinî, p. 246; and though the exact course of
proceedings in the ancient law courts of India is still, in many
details, uncertain, it is yet clear that the actual apportionment of
punishment (as well as the execution of it) was always held to be the
sole prerogative of the king. This was more especially the case where
mutilation or a death sentence was concerned. Minor punishments the
judges could, no doubt, order without reference to the king. See jolly,
'Beiträge zur indischen Rechts-geschichte,' in the 'Zeitschrift der
deutschen morg. Gesellschaft,' 1890, pp. 344 foll.

<span id="fn_663"></span>[268:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_672.md) The Si*m*halese,
pp. 525-531, goes at great length into the details of all these vows,
each of which it divides into stages of greater or less severity,
specifying the practice to be followed in each stage. As a matter of
fact the members of the Buddhist Order have not observed them in any
completeness. Like the Buddha himself, the majority have undertaken only
the second of the thirteen-the wearing of three robes; and the others
have only been occasionally practised, and then usually only one or more
at a time, by isolated members. It is true that the *G*âtaka Commentary
(Fausböll, vol. ii, p. 449) says that Upasena Vangantaputta kept the
whole thirteen of the Dhuta<u>n</u>gas. But this is at variance with the
older text (in the Vinaya, Nissaggiya, No. XV) giving that account of
the same episode on which the story in the <span id="page_269">p.
269</span> *G*âtaka Commentary is based. The thirteen vows are not
referred to at all in the rules of the Order, as translated in the three
volumes of the Vinaya Texts, nor are they mentioned as a whole in any
Pi*t*aka text yet published. But the thirteen names are given together
in a different order in a passage twice repeated in the Parivâra, a late
book, probably written in Ceylon (pp. 131, 193). It is there declared of
each of the thirteen vows that five sorts of people undertake
them--those who do so from stupidity, those who do so from vain desire,
those who are mad, those who do so because the vows have been exalted by
the Buddhas and their followers, those who do so from high motives. It
is clear therefore that our author's doctrine of the thirteen
Dhuta<u>n</u>gas is at variance with primitive Buddhism. It would
require, however, a separate note on each of the thirteen to show the
exact degree of this variance. The basis on which each of these
observances rests can be found in the older teaching, and nearly all of
them have been praised or followed, in a greater or less degree, from
very early times,--not indeed as general rules binding on all members of
the Order, but as supplementary or extra vows, conducive, but subsidiary
to the ethical self-culture of the Arahat.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[270:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_673.md) According to the
Si*m*halese this was a Brahman clan. But the derivation suggests the
borders of Bengal, where it is somewhat strange to find Brahmans so
early.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[271:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_674.md) Oramati. See
*G*âtaka I, 492, where it is also used intransitively in the sense of
'abase oneself;' and *G*âtaka I, 498, where it is transitive, 'to lower'
(the water in the ocean). But Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 533, has simply
œlêda, 'and adheres thereto.'

<span id="fn_666"></span>[271:2](sbe3608.htm#fr_675.md) As remarked in the
note, p. 268, this episode is taken from the introduction to the 15th
Nissaggiya.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[272:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_676.md) Compare 'Buddhist
Suttas,' p. 10, and the note there.

<span id="fn_668"></span>[273:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_677.md) Abhinîta-vâso,
'having the ten ariya-vâsas,' says the Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_669"></span>[273:2](sbe3608.htm#fr_678.md) Di*tth*a-dhammo,
'seen the Four Truths,' says the Si*m*halese, p. 535.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[273:3](sbe3608.htm#fr_679.md) For sa<u>n</u>kha
Hîna*t*i-kumburê has sahassa.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[274:1](sbe3608.htm#fr_680.md) A<u>n</u>guttara I,
13, 7.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[274:2](sbe3608.htm#fr_681.md) The ninth, because
the numbering of the Vaggas is carried on from the last book. But
according to the divisions enumerated at the beginning of the work
(translated at p. 4 of the previous volume) it is one of the principal
divisions of the book that is here closed, and the chapters ought not to
run on.
