# INTRODUCTION.

I HAVE first to notice a few points as to the history of the Milinda
book which have either come to light since the former Introduction was
written, or which I then omitted to notice.

Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio in his Catalogue of Chinese Buddhist Books <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) mentions a Chinese book called Nâ-sien
Pi*kh*iu *K*in (that is 'The Book of the Bhikshu Nâgasena' Sûtra) <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md). I have been so fortunate as to receive
detailed information about this book both from Dr. Serge d'Oldenbourg in
St. Petersburg and from M. Sylvain Lévi in Paris. Professor Serge
d'Oldenbourg forwarded to me, in the spring of 1892, a translation into
English (which he himself had been kind enough to make) from a
translation into Russian by Mr. Ivanovsky, of the Chinese Introduction,
and of various episodes in the Chinese which seemed to differ from the
Pâli. This very valuable aid to the interpretation of the Milinda, which
the unselfish courtesy of these two Russian scholars intended thus to
place at my disposal, was most unfortunately lost in the post; and I
have only been able to gather from a personal interview with Professor
d'Oldenbourg that the Introduction was a sort of *G*âtaka story in which
the Buddha appeared as a white elephant <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md).

By a curious coincidence this regrettable loss has been

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

since made good by the work of two French scholars. Mons. Sylvain Lévi
forwarded to the Ninth International Congress of Orientalists, held in
London in the autumn of 1892, a careful study on the subject by M.
Edouard Specht, preceded by an introductory essay by himself.

It appears from this paper, which excited much interest when it was
read, that there are, not one, but two separate and distinct works
extant in China under the name of Nâ-sien Pi*kh*iu *K*in, the one
inserted in the Korean collection made in that country in 1010 A.D., and
the other printed in the collection of Buddhist books published under
the Sung in 1239. Neither the date nor the author of either version
seems to be known, but Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio states of his work, which is
probably one of the two, that it was composed between 317 and 420
A.D. <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md) The Korean book gives much less
of the matter contained in our books II and III than the later work in
the Sung collection, the former containing only 13,752 characters while
the latter has 22,657. In the matter of the order of the questions also
the later of the two Chinese books follows much more closely the order
found in the present translation than does the work found in the Korean
collection.

This paper has since been published in the Proceedings of the
Congress <span id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4.md), and it gives translations of
several episodes on questions in which the Chinese is said to throw
light on the Pâli. Both M. Specht and M. Sylvain Lévi seem to think that
the two Chinese books were translations of older recensions of the work
than the one preserved in Pâli. This argument does not seem to me, as at
present advised, at all certain. It by no means follows that a shorter
recension, merely because it is shorter, must necessarily be older than
a longer one. It is quite as possible that the longer one gave rise to
the shorter ones.

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

\[paragraph continues\] The story of a discussion between Nâgasena and
Milinda is no doubt, if the arguments in the Introduction to Part I are
of any avail, an historical romance with an ethical tendency. In
constant repetition, after it had become popular, it is precisely those
parts which do not appeal so easily to the popular ear (because they
deal, not with ordinary puzzles, but with dilemmas or with the higher
mysteries of Arahatship), that would be naturally omitted. I do not go
so far as to say that it must have been so. But I venture to think that
for a critical judgment as to the comparative dates of the three works
on the same subject, now known to exist, we must wait till translations
of the whole of the two independent Chinese versions are before us. And
further that the arguments must then turn on quite other considerations
than the very ambiguous conclusions to be drawn merely from the length
or shortness of the different treatment in each case. It is very much to
be hoped therefore that M. Specht will soon give us complete versions of
the two Chinese works in question.

At present it can only be said that we have a very pretty puzzle
propounded to us, a puzzle much more difficult to solve than those which
king Milinda put to Nâgasena the sage. If the shorter version (or rather
paraphrase, for it does not seem to be a version at all in our modern
sense)--that from the Korea--be really the original, how comes it that
the other Chinese book, included in a collection made two centuries
later, should happen to differ from it in the precise parts in which it,
the supposed original, differs from the Pâli? Surely the only probable
hypothesis would be that of the Chinese books, both working on the same
original, the later is more exact than the earlier: and that we simply
have here one more instance of an already well-known characteristic of
Chinese reproductions of Indian books--namely, that the later version is
more accurate than the older one. The later a Chinese 'translation' the
better, in the few cases where comparison is possible, it has proved to
be (that is, the nearer to our idea of what a translation should be);

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

and Tibetan versions are better, as a rule, than the best of the
Chinese.

Since the publication of this very interesting paper, M. Sylvain Lévi
has had the great kindness to send me an advance proof of a more
complete paper, to be published in Paris, in which M. Specht and himself
have made a detailed analysis of the three versions, setting out over
against the English translation of each question (as contained in the
first volume of the present work) the translations of it as they appear
in each of the Chinese versions. I have not been able by a study of this
analysis to add anything to the admirable summary of the conclusions as
to the relations of these two books to one another and to the Pâli which
are given by M. Specht in his article in the Proceedings of the Ninth
Congress. The later version is throughout much nearer to the Pâli; but
neither of the two give more than a small portion of it, the earlier
does not seem to go much further than our Volume I, page 99 (just where
the Pâli has the remark, 'Here end the questions of king Milinda'), and
the later, though it goes beyond this point, apparently stops at Volume
I, page 114.

These details are of importance for the decision of the critical
question of the history of the Milinda. The book starts with an
elaborate and very skilful introduction, giving first an account of the
way in which Nâgasena and Milinda had met in a previous birth, then the
life history, in order, of each of them in this birth, then the account
of how they met. Throughout the whole story the attention is constantly
directed to the very great ability of the two disputants, and to the
fact that they had been specially prepared through their whole existence
for this great encounter, which was to be of the first importance for
religion and for the world. This introductory story occupies in my
translation thirty-nine pages. Is it likely that so stately an entrance
hall should have really been built to lead only into one or two small
rooms?--to two chapters occupying only sixty pages more? Is it not more
probable that the original architect had a better sense of proportion?
As an Introduction to the book as we have it in these

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

volumes the story told in those thirty-nine pages is very much in place;
as an Introduction to the first two chapters only, or to the first two
and a portion of the third, it is quite incongruous. And accordingly we
find in the very beginning of the Introduction a kind of table of
contents in which the shape of the whole book, as we have it here, is
foreshadowed in detail, and in due proportion. This will have to be
taken into account when, with full translations of the two Chinese books
before us, we shall have to consider whether they are really copies of
the original statue, or whether they are interesting fragments.

I ought not to close this reference to the labours of MM. Lévi and
Specht without calling attention to a slip of the pen in one expression
used by M. Sylvain Lévi regarding the Milinda <span
id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md). He says, 'La science ne connaissait
jusqu'ici de cet ouvrage qu'un texte écrit en Pâli et incorporé dans le
canon Singhalais?' Now there is, accurately speaking, no such thing as a
Sinhalese canon of the Buddhist Scriptures, any more than there is a
French or an English canon of the Christian Scriptures. The canon of the
three Pi*t*akas, settled in the valley of the Ganges (probably at Patna
in the time of Asoka), has been adhered to, it is true, in Ceylon,
Burma, and Siam. But it cannot properly be called either a Ceylonese or
a Burmese or a Siamese canon. In that canon the Milinda was never
incorporated. And not only so, but the expression used clearly implies
that there is some other canon. Now there has never been any other canon
of the Buddhist Scriptures besides this one of the three Pi*t*akas. Many
Buddhist books, not incorporated in the canon, have been composed in
different languages--Pâli, Sanskrit, Chinese, Tibetan, Japanese,
Sinhalese, Burmese, Siamese, &c.--but no new canon, in the European
meaning of the phrase, has ever been formed.

One meets occasionally, no doubt, in European books on Buddhism
allusions or references to a later canon

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

supposed to have been settled at the Council of Kanishka. The, blunder
originated, I believe, with Mr. Beal. But in the only account of that
Council which we possess, that of Yuan Thsang <span
id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md), there is no mention at all of any new canon
having been settled. The account is long and detailed. An occurrence of
so extreme an importance would scarcely have escaped the notice of the
Chinese writer. But throughout the account the canonicity of the three
Pi*t*akas is simply taken for granted. The members of the Council were
chosen exclusively from those who knew the three Pi*t*akas, and the work
they performed was the composition of three books--the Upade*s*a, the
Vinaya Vibhâshâ, and the Abhidharma Vibhâshâ. The words which follow in
the Chinese have been differently interpreted by the European
translators. Julien says:

'They (the members of the Council) thoroughly explained the three
Pi*t*akas, and thus placed them above all the books of antiquity <span
id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7.md).'

Beal, on the other hand, renders:

'Which (namely, which three books) thoroughly explained the three
Pi*t*akas. There was no work of antiquity to be compared with (placed
above) their productions <span id="fr_8"></span>[3](#fn_8.md).'

It is immaterial which version best conveys the meaning of the original.
They both clearly show that, in the view of Yuan Thsang, the Council of
Kanishka did not establish any new canon. Since that time the rulers of
China, Japan, and Tibet have from time to time published collections of
Buddhist books. But none of these collections even purports to be a
canon of the Scriptures. They contain works of very various, and some
quite modern, ages and authors: and can no more be regarded as a canon
of the Buddhist Scriptures than Migne's voluminous collection of
Christian books can be called a new canon of the Christian Scriptures.

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

This was already pointed out in my little manual, 'Buddhism,' published
in 1877, and it is a pity that references in subsequent books to a
supposed canon settled at Kanishka's Council have still perpetuated the
blunder. M. Sylvain Lévi, for whose genius and scholarship I have the
profoundest respect, does not actually say that there was such a canon;
but his words must lead readers, ignorant of the facts, to imply that
there was one.

I have also to add that M. Barth has called attention <span
id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) to the fact that M. Sylvain Lévi has added
another service to those already mentioned as rendered by him to the
interpretation of the Milinda, by a discussion of the reference to our
book in the Abhidharma-ko*s*a-vyâkhyâ, referred to in my previous
Introduction, p. xxvi. This discussion was published in a periodical I
have not seen <span id="fr_10"></span>[2](#fn_10.md). But it seems that M.
Lévi, with the help of two Chinese translations, has been able to show
that the citation is not only in the commentary, but also in the text,
of Vasubandhu's work. M. Léon Feer has been kind enough to send me the
actual words of the reference, and they will be found published in the
'Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society' for 1991, p. 476.

Professor Serge d'Oldenbourg has also been good enough to point out to
me that the two Cambridge MSS. of Kshemendra's
Bodhisattvâvadâna-kalpalatâ read Milinda (not Millinda as given by
Râjendra Lâl Mitra <span id="fr_11"></span>[3](#fn_11).md) as the name of
the king referred to in the 57th Avadâna, the Stûpâvadâna. I had not
noticed this reference to the character in our historical romance. It
comes in quite incidentally, the Buddha prophesying to Indra that a king
Milinda would erect a stûpa at Pâ*t*aligrâma. There is no allusion to
our book, and the passage is only interesting as showing that the memory
of king Milinda still survived in India at the time when Kshemendra
wrote in the eleventh century A.D.

Another reference to one of the characters in the Milinda

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

which has Come to notice since the publication of part i, is in the
closing words of the Attha-Sâlinî-Atthayo*g*anâ (a *t*ikâ on
Buddhaghosa's first work, his commentary on the Dhamma Sanga*n*i), which
was written in Siam after the twelfth century by *Ñ*ânakitti, and edited
in 1890 at Galle, by Pa*ññ*âsekhara Unnânsê. On page 265 we read:

Vattaniya-senâsane ti Vi*ñgh*â*t*aviya*m* Vattaniya-senâsane. Tena
vutta*m* Mahâva*m*se:

Assagutta-mahâthero pabhinna-Pa*t*isambhido  
Sa*tth*i-bhikkhû sahassâni Vi*ñgh*a*tt*aviyam âdiya  
Vattaniya-senâsanâ nabhasâ tattha-m-otarîti.

'The words Vattaniya-senâsane mean, "in the Vattaniya Hermitage in the
Vindhya Desert." Therefore it is said in the Mahâva*m*sa:

'"The great Thera Assagutta, who knew so well the Pa*t*isambhidâ,
bringing sixty thousand brethren from the Vattaniya Hermitage in the
Vindhya Desert through the sky, descended there."'

This quotation is very interesting. It follows that in the original text
of the Attha Sâlinî there is something about the Vattaniya Hermitage.
And also that the author of this *T*îkâ must have had before him some
text of our Mahâva*m*sa differing from ours, or perhaps some other
Mahâva*m*sa. For the lines quoted do not occur in our text. The nearest
approach to them is one line in the description of the assembly that
came together at the consecration of the Mahâ Thûpa at Anurâdhapura in
the year 157 B.C. It runs <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md):

Vi*ñgh*â*t*avi-Vattaniya-senasânâ <span id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md) tu
Uttaro  
Thero, sa*tth*i-sahassâni bhikkhû âdâya âgamâ.

'The thera Uttara came up bringing with him sixty thousand Bhikshus from
the Vattaniya Hermitage \[not Uttania Temple as Turnour translates\] in
the Vindhya Desert.'

The resemblance of the passages is striking. But all

<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span>

that can be concluded is that the author of our Mahâva*m*sa, Mahânâma,
who wrote in the middle of the fifth century, knew of the Vattaniya
Hermitage; and that the author of the text quoted by *Ñ*ânakitti (in a
passage probably describing the same event) mentions an Assagutta as
having come to the festival from his hermitage at Vattaniya.

Both these references are entirely legendary. In order to magnify the
importance of the great festival held in Ceylon on the occasion referred
to, it is related that certain famous members of the Buddhist order
came, attended by many followers, through the sky, to take part in the
ceremony. A comparison of this list with the previous list, also given
in the Mahâva*m*sa <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md), of the
missionaries sent out nearly a hundred years before, by Asoka, will show
that the names in the second list are in great part an echo of those in
the first. But in selecting well-known names, Mahânâma in his second,
fabulous, list has, according to the published text, also included that
of the Vattaniya Hermitage, and, according to the new verse in the other
text, has associated with that place the name of Assagutta, not found
elsewhere except in the Milinda. In that book the residence of Assagutta
is not specified--it is his friend Roha*n*a who lives at the Vattaniya,
and the locality of the Vattaniya is not specified--it would seem from
the statement at I, 25 (part i, p. 20 of this translation) that it was a
day's journey from 'the Guarded Slope,' that is, in the Himâlayas. But
geographical allusions are apt to be misleading when the talk is of
Bhikshus who could fly through the air. And it seems the most probable
explanation that the authors of these verses, in adopting these names,
had the Milinda story in their mind.

\[Turnour's reading of the name as Uttara, and not Assagutta, is
confirmed by the Dîpava*m*sa, chap. XIX, verses 4-6, where all the
fourteen names of the visitors from India are given (without any details
as to the districts whence they came), and the corresponding name is
also Uttara there.\]

<span id="page_xx">p. xx</span>

The above sets out all the new information I have been able to glean
about the Milinda since the publication of the Introduction to the first
volume of this translation. I had hoped in this Introduction to discuss
the doctrines, as apart from the historical and geographical allusions,
of our author--comparing his standpoint with that of the earliest
Buddhists, set out in the four great Nikâyas, with that of later books
contained in the Pi*t*akas, and with that of still later works not
included in the canon at all. I have to express my regret that a long
and serious illness, culminating in a serious accident that was very
nearly a fatal one, has deprived me altogether of the power of work, and
not only prevented me from carrying out this perhaps too ambitious
design, but has so long delayed the writing of this Introduction.

Only one of the preliminary habours to the intended Introduction was
completed. I read through the Kathâ Vatthu, which has not yet been
edited, with a view of ascertaining whether, at the time when that book
was written, that is, in the time of Asoka, the kind of questions
agitating the Buddhist community bore any relation to the kind of
questions discussed by the: author of our Milinda. As is well known, the
Kathâ Vatthu sets out a number of points on which the orthodox school,
that of the Thera-vâdins, differed in Asoka's time from the other
seventeen schools (afterwards called collectively the Hînayâna) which
had sprung up among the Buddhists between the time of the Buddha and
that of Asoka. I published in the 'Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'
for 1892 a statement, both in the original Pâli and in English, of all
the points thus discussed by the author of the Kathâ Vatthu,
Moggali-putta Tissa Thera, giving (from the commentary) the names of the
various schools against whom, in each instance, his remarks were
directed.

It is now possible to judge from this analysis of the questions
proposed, what were the subjects on which differences obtained among the
early Buddhists. There are a number of points raised in Tissa's
discussions which are also discussed by the author of the Milinda. In
every

<span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span>

instance the two authors agree in their views, Nâgasena in the Milinda
always advocating the opinion which Tissa puts forward as that of the
Thera-vâdins. This is especially the case with those points which
Moggali-putta Tissa thinks of so much importance that he discusses them
at much greater length than the others.

His first chapter, for instance, by far the longest in his book, is on
the question whether, in the high and truest sense of the word, there
can be said to be a 'soul' <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md). It is
precisely this question which forms also the subject of the very first
discussion between Milinda and Nâgasena, the conversation leading up to
the celebrated simile of the chariot by which Nâgasena apparently
convinces Milinda of the truth of the orthodox Buddhist view that there
is really no such thing as a 'soul' in the ordinary sense <span
id="fr_16"></span>[2](#fn_16.md). On leaving the sage, the king returns to
his palace, and the next day the officer who escorts Nâgasena there to
renew the discussion, occupies the time to raise again the same
question, and is answered by the simile of the musicians <span
id="fr_17"></span>[3](#fn_17.md). Not content with these two expositions of
this important doctrine, the author of the Milinda returns again soon
afterwards to the same point, which he illustrates by the simile of the
palace <span id="fr_18"></span>[4](#fn_18.md), and further on in the book
he takes occasion to discuss and refute the commonly held opinion that
there is a soul in inanimate things, such as water <span
id="fr_19"></span>[5](#fn_19.md).

It cannot be doubted that the authors of the Kathâ Vatthu and the
Milinda were perfectly justified in putting this crucial question in the
very forefront of their discussion--just as the Buddha himself, as is
well known, made it the subject of the very first discourse he addressed
to his earliest converted followers, the Anatta-lakkha*n*a Sutta,
included both in the Vinaya and in the A<u>n</u>guttara Nikâya <span
id="fr_20"></span>[6](#fn_20.md).

The history of ideas about the 'soul' has yet to be

<span id="page_xxii">p. xxii</span>

written. But the outlines of it are pretty well established, and there
is nothing to show that the Indian notions on the subject, apart perhaps
from the subsidiary beliefs in Karma and transmigration, were materially
different from those obtaining elsewhere. Already in prehistoric times
the ancestors of the Indian peoples, whether Aryan by race or not, had
come to believe, probably through the influence of dreams, in the
existence inside each man of a subtle image of the man himself. This
weird and intangible form left the body during sleep, and at death it
continued in some way to live. It was a crude hypothesis found useful to
explain the phenomena of dreams, of motion, and of life. And it was
applied very indiscriminately to the allied phenomena in external
things--the apparent life and motion, not only of animals, but also of
plants and rivers, of winds and celestial bodies, being explained by the
hypothesis of a soul within them. The varying conditions and appearances
of the external world gave rise to the various powers and qualities
ascribed to these external souls, and hence to whole systems of
polytheism and mythology. And just as the gods, which never had any
existence except in the ideas of their worshippers, were born and grew
and changed and passed away with those ideas, so also the hypothesis of
internal souls had, no less in India than elsewhere, a continual change,
a continual development--and this not only as to ideas on the nature and
origin of the internal human souls, but as to their relation to the
external souls or gods. And when speculation, which loved to busy itself
with these mysterious and fanciful hypotheses, had learnt to conjecture
a unity behind the variety of external spirits, the relation of men's
souls to the one great first cause, to God, became the subject of
endless discussions, of varying views invented to harmonise with varying
preconceived conceptions.

When Buddhism arose these hypotheses as to 'souls,' internal and
external, formed the basis of all the widely differing, and very living
and earnest, religious and philosophical speculations in the valley of
the Ganges, where there then obtained that marvellous freedom of thought

<span id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span>

on all such subjects which has been throughout its history a
distinguishing characteristic of the Indian people. Now there is one
work, of more importance than any other in Buddhism, the collection of
the Dialogues of Gotama the Buddha, brought together in the Dîgha and
Ma*ggh*ima Nikâyas. It contains the views of the Buddha set out, as they
appeared to his very earliest disciples, in a series of 185
conversational discourses, which will some day come to hold a place, in
the history of human thought, akin to that held by the Dialogues of
Plato. Is it a mere chance, or is it the actual result of the
necessities of the case, that this question of 'souls' is put into the
forefront of this collection, just as it is the point treated first and
at the greatest length in the Kathâ Vatthu, and put first also in the
Milinda?

The first of these 185 dialogues is the Brahma*g*âla Suttanta, the
discourse called the Perfect Net, the net whose meshes are so fine that
no folly of superstition, however subtle, can slip through--the clearing
away of the rubbish before the foundations are laid for the new palace
of good sense. In it are set out sixty-two varieties of existing
hypotheses, and after each and all of them has been rejected, the
doctrine of Arahatship is put forward as the right solution. The
sixty-two heresies are as follows:

1-4. SASSATA-VÂDÂ. People who, either from meditation of three degrees,
or fourthly through logic and reasoning, have come to believe that both
the external world as a whole, and individual souls, are eternal.

5-8. EKA*KK*A-SASSATIKÂ. People who, in four ways, hold that some souls
are eternal, while others are not.

a\. Those who hold that God is eternal, but not the individual souls.

b\. Those who hold that all the gods are eternal, but not the individual
souls.

c\. Those who hold that certain illustrious gods are eternal, but not
the human souls.

<span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span>

d\. Those who hold that while the bodily forms are not eternal, there is
a subtle something, called Heart or Mind, or Consciousness, which is.

9-12. ANTÂNTIKÂ. People who chop logic about finity and infinity.

a\. Those who hold the world to be finite.

b\. Those who hold it to be infinite.

c\. Those who hold it to be both.

d\. Those who hold it to be neither.

13-16. AMARA-VIKKHEPIKÂ. People who equivocate about virtue and vice--

a\. From the fear that if they express a decided opinion grief at
possible mistake will injure them.

b\. That they may form attachments which will injure them.

c\. That they may be unable to answer skilful disputants.

d\. From dullness and stupidity.

17, 18. ADHI*KK*A-SAMUPPANIKÂ. People who think that the origin of
things can be explained without a cause.

19-50. UDDHAMA-ÂGHATANIKÂ. People who believe in the future existence of
human souls.

a\. Sixteen different phases of the hypothesis of a conscious existence
after death.

b\. Eight different phases of the hypothesis of an unconscious existence
after death.

c\. Eight different phases of the hypothesis of an existence between
consciousness and unconsciousness after death.

51-57. UKKHEDA-VÂDâ. People who teach the doctrine that there is a soul,
but that it will cease to exist on the death of the body here, or at the
end of a next life, or of further lives in higher and ever higher states
of being.

58-62. DI*TTH*A-DHAMMIKA-NIBBÂNA-VÂDÂ. People who hold that there is a
soul, and that it can attain to perfect bliss in this present world, or
in whatever world it happens to be--

<span id="page_xxv">p. xxv</span>

a\. By a full, complete, and perfect enjoyment of the five senses.

b\. By an enquiring mental abstraction (the First Dhyâna).

c\. By undisturbed mental bliss, untarnished by enquiry (the Second
Dhyâna).

d\. By mental peace, free alike from joy and pain and enquiry (the Third
Dhyâna).

e\. By this mental peace plus a sense of purity (the Fourth Dhyâna).

Professor Garbe, in his just published 'Sankhya Philosophie <span
id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md),' holds that the first persons attacked in
this list are the followers of the Sâ<u>n</u>khya. The double view of
the Sassata-vâdâ is no doubt the basis of the Sâ<u>n</u>khya system. But
the system contains much more, and it would be safer to say that we have
here a warning against the philosophical view which afterwards developed
into the Sâ<u>n</u>khya, or rather which became afterwards a fundamental
part of the Sâ<u>n</u>khya. The Vedânta, in either of its forms, is not,
it will be noticed, referred to in any one of the sixty-two divisions;
but philosophical views forming part of the Vedânta may be traced in
Nos. 5, 8, 10, 20, &c. The scheme is not intended as a refutation of the
views, as a whole, held by any special school or individual, but as a
statement of erroneous views on two special points, namely, the soul and
the world. However this may be, we find an ample justification in this
comprehensive and systematic condemnation of all current or possible
forms of the soul-theory for the prominence which the author of the
Milinda gives to the subject.

The other points on which the Milinda may be compared with the Kathâ
Vatthu will need less comment. The discussion in the Milinda as to the
manner in which the Divine Eye can arise in a man <span
id="fr_22"></span>[2](#fn_22.md), is a reminiscence of the question raised
in the Kathâ Vatthu III, 7 as to whether the eye of flesh can, through
strength of dhamma, grow into the Divine Eye. The discussion in the
Milinda as to

<span id="page_xxvi">p. xxvi</span>

how a layman, who is a layman after becoming an Arahat, can enter the
Order <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md), is entirely in accord with
the opinion maintained, as against the Uttarâpathakâ, in the Kathâ
Vatthu IV, i. Our Milinda ascribes the verses,

'Exert yourselves, be strong, and to the faith,' &c.,

to the Buddha <span id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_24.md). In the note on that
passage I had pointed out that they are ascribed, not to the Buddha, but
to Abhibhû in certain Pi*t*aka texts, and to the Buddha himself only in
late Sanskrit works. In the exposition of Kathâ Vatthu II, 3 the verses
are also ascribed to the Buddha. The proposition in the Kathâ Vatthu II,
8 that the Buddha, in the ordinary affairs of life, was not
transcendental, agrees with Nâgasena's argument in the Milinda, part ii,
pp. 8-12. The discussion in the Milinda as to whether an Arahat can be
thoughtless or guilty of an offence <span id="fr_25"></span>[3](#fn_25.md)
is foreshadowed by the similar points raised in the Kathâ Vatthu I, 2;
II, 1, 2, and VIII, 11. And the two dilemmas, Nos. 65 and 66, especially
as to the cause of space, may be compared with the discussion in Kathâ
Vatthu VI, 6, as to whether space is self-existent.

The general result of a comparison between these two very interesting
books of controversial apologetics seems to me to be that the
differences between them are just such as one might expect (*a*) from
the difference of date, and (*b*) from the fact that the controversy in
the older book is carried on against members of the same communion,
whereas in the Milinda we have a defence of Buddhism as against the
outsider. The Kathâ Vatthu takes almost the whole of the conclusions
reached in the Milinda for granted, and goes on to discuss further
questions on points of detail. It does not give a description of
Arahatship in glowing terms, but discusses minor points as to whether
the realisation of Arahatship includes the Fruits of the three lower
paths <span id="fr_26"></span>[4](#fn_26.md), or whether all the qualities
of an Arahat are free from the Âsavas <span
id="fr_27"></span>[5](#fn_27.md), or whether the knowledge of his

<span id="page_xxvii">p. xxvii</span>

emancipation alone makes a man an Arahat <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md), or whether the breaking of the Fetters
constitutes Arahatship, and whether the insight into Arahatship suffices
to break all the Fetters <span id="fr_29"></span>[2](#fn_29.md), and so on.

The discussion of these details gives no opportunity for the
enthusiastic eloquence of the author of our Milinda, and the very fact
of his eloquence argues a later date. But there can be no doubt as to
the superiority of his style. And I still adhere to the opinions
expressed in the former Introduction that the work, as it stands in the
Pâli, is of its kind (that is, as a book of apologetic controversy) the
best in point of style that had then been written in any country; and
that it is the masterpiece of Indian prose.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[xi:1](sbe3602.htm#fr_0.md) Called on the title-page
'Catalogue of the Chinese Translation of the Buddhist Tripi*t*aka.' But
this must surely be a mistake. It includes a number of works which are
not translations at all, and translations of a large number of others
which do not belong to the Pi*t*akas.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[xi:2](sbe3602.htm#fr_1.md) No. 1358 in the
Catalogue. Translated under the Eastern Tsin Dynasty, 317-420.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[xi:3](sbe3602.htm#fr_2.md) As there is nothing
about this curious Introduction in either of M. Specht's papers to be
mentioned immediately, it seems possible that there are really three
Chinese books on the same subject.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[xii:1](sbe3602.htm#fr_3.md) It would be very
interesting to have this point decided; namely, whether the volume in
the India Office Library is identical with either of the two very
different books in Paris. If not, we have, then, still another Chinese
book on Milinda.
