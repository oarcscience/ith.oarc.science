# ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS.

### PART 1.

P. xxv. For 'Mahâyâna' read 1 Madhyamika.' There is a Nâgasena mentioned
in the Bharhut Tope.

6, l. 1. Read 'to Tissa the Elder, the son of the Moggalî.' The whole
sentence had better perhaps have been rendered: 'And these two also were
foreseen by our Buddha (just as he foresaw Tissa the Elder, the son of
the Moggalî), in that he foretold, saying, &c.'

30, n. 1. The phrase isi-vâta*m* parivâta*m* nagara*m* aka*m*su recurs
at *G*âtaka III, 142; Samanta Pâsadikâ 316; Saddhamma Sa*m*gaha 41.

32, n. 1. Compare Saddhamma Samgaha, p. 42.

60, § 13. On the first simile, compare the Samyutta Nikâya XXII, 102, 7.

76, last line. For 'yoke' read 'yolk.'

78\. It would have been better perhaps to have avoided the use of the
words 'where' and 'there,' and to have rendered: 'In the case of beings
who, having died, have been reborn elsewhere, time is. In the case of
beings who, having died, have not been reborn elsewhere, time is not.
And in the case of beings, &c.' The three cases are those of the
Puthu*gg*ana, the Arahat when dead, and the Arahat alive. My note refers
to the third case, not to the second; and should, I think, be modified
accordingly. See Sa*m*yutta Nikâya III, 12, 35; Mahâ Parinibbâna Sutta
IV, 3; Dhammapada, verse 89; Sutta Nipâta II, 13, 1, 12; Ma*ggh*ima
Nikâya I, 235; *G*âtaka IV, 453; and compare Udâna, p. 80.

Hîna*t*i-kumburê gives only a literal translation. A similar question is
discussed in the Kathâ Vatthu XV, 3.

99, n. 1. For 'chapter' read 'book, p. 39.'

107, l. 16. After 'brought about' insert a comma.

118, 5. I now prefer 'initiation' instead of 'ordination' as the
translation of Upasampadâ.

119, n. 1. This interpretation is confirmed by part ii, p. 197.

129, l. 7. The phrase, 'though his hands and feet were cut off,' seems,
at first sight, out of place. But compare part ii, p. 147.

150, l. 2. Read I and not accepting them.'

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

P. 153, § 18. Read 'Ki*ñk*â:' and compare *G*âtaka IV, 189.

164 (six lines from the bottom of the page). Read 'and then a subsequent
ease to the pain he has given.'

176, § 39. In accordance with the note at part ii, pp. 86, 87, we must
read 'a huge and mighty cauldron, full of water and crowded with grains
of rice, is placed over a fireplace.'

179\. On the problem of king Sivi and his new eyes, compare the question
discussed in Kathâ Vatthu III, 7.

229, n. 1, l. 6. For 'these' read 'those.'

239, n. 2. For 'But I never think' read 'But I now think.'

241, § 20. For 'The Master said, Nâgasena,' read 'The Master said, O
king.'

244, n. 2. For '*G*atharaggi' read '*G*a*th*araggi.'

278, n. 1. For 'adika' read 'âdika.'

288, n. 3. For 'purdhita' read 'purohita.'

190, n. 2. This story, which I could not trace, is no doubt the one
referred to in Kariyâ Pi*t*aka I, 7.

291, l. 22. Read 'Uposatha.'

### PART II.

P. 27, last line but two. Read 'kâma-loka.'

29, n. 2, l. 7. Read 'sa*m*sâra.'

139, l, 4. For 'sun and moon' read 'moon and sun.'

748, two lines from the bottom. For 'O king' read 'Sir.'

150, four lines from the bottom. For 'destructions' read 'distinctions.'

166, n. 1. Read 'samâhato.'

219, n. 2. Read 'bhavanâ.'

252, l. 4. For 'pulling' read 'putting.'

271, n. 1. Compare the 'Journal of the Pâli Text Society,' 1887, p. 155.
