# BOOK VII. CHAPTER 7.

## THE SIMILES (continued).

### 61. THE WATERPOT.

1\. \[**414**\] 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the waterpot
you say he ought to take, which is it?'

'Just, O king, as the waterpot when it is full gives forth no sound;
just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, even
when he has reached the summit of Sama*n*aship, and knows all tradition
and learning and interpretation, yet should give forth no sound, not
pride himself thereon, not show himself puffed up, but putting away
pride and self-righteousness, should be straightforward, not garrulous
of himself, neither deprecating others. This, O king, is the quality of
the waterpot he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed
One, the god over all gods, in the Sutta Nipâta:

"What is not full, that is the thing that sounds,  
That which is full is noiseless and at rest;  
The fool is like an empty waterpot,  
The wise man like a deep pool, clear and full <span
id="fr_850"></span>[1](#fn_841.md)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 62. BLACK IRON <span id="fr_851"></span>[2](#fn_842.md).

2\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those two qualities of black iron you say he
ought to take, which are they?'

\[**415**\] 'Just, O king, as black iron even when

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

beaten out <span id="fr_852"></span>[1](#fn_843.md) carries weight; just
so, O king, should the mind of the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort,
be able, by his habit of thoughtfulness, to carry heavy burdens. This, O
king, is the first quality of black iron he ought to have.

3\. 'And again, O king, as black iron does not vomit up the water it has
once soaked in <span id="fr_853"></span>[2](#fn_844.md); just so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never give up the faith
he has once felt in the greatness of the Blessed One, the Supreme
Buddha, in the perfection of his Doctrine, in the excellence of the
Order--never give up the knowledge he has once acquired of the
impermanence of forms, or of sensations, or of ideas, or of qualities,
or of modes of consciousness. This, O king, is the second quality of
black iron he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed
One, the god over all gods:

"That man who is in insight purified,  
Trained in the doctrine of the Noble Ones,  
Grasping distinctions as they really are,  
What need hath he to tremble? Not in part  
Only, but in its full extent, shall he  
To the clear heights of Arahatship attain <span
id="fr_854"></span>[3](#fn_845.md)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 63. THE SUNSHADE.

4\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those three qualities of the sunshade <span
id="fr_855"></span>[4](#fn_846.md) you say he ought to take, which are
they?'

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

'Just, O king, as the sunshade goes along over one's head; just so, O
king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be of a character
above all evil dispositions. This, O king, is the first quality of the
sunshade he ought to have.

5\. 'And again, O king, just as the sunshade is held over the head by a
handle; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, have thoughtfulness as his handle. This, O king, is the second
quality of the sunshade he ought to have.

6\. 'And again, O king, as the sunshade wards off winds and heat and
storms of rain; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest
in effort, ward off the empty winds of the opinions of the numerous
Samanas and Brahmans who hold forth their various and divergent
nostrums, ward off the heat of the threefold fire (of lust, malice, and
dullness), and ward off the rains of evil dispositions. \[**416**\]
This, O king, is the third quality of the sunshade he ought to have. For
it was said, O king, by Sâriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the
Faith:

"As a broad sunshade spreading far and firm,  
Without a hole from rim to rim, wards off  
The burning heat, and the god's mighty rain;  
So doth the Buddha's son, all pure within,  
Bearing the sunshade brave of righteousness,  
Ward off the rain of evil tendencies,  
And the dread heat of all the threefold fire <span
id="fr_856"></span>[1](#fn_847.md)."'

 

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

### 64. THE RICE FIELD.

7\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those three qualities of the rice field you say
he ought to have, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the rice field is provided with canals for irrigation;
just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be
provided with the lists of the various duties incumbent on the righteous
man--the canals that bring the water to the rice fields of the Buddha's
doctrine <span id="fr_857"></span>[1](#fn_848.md). This, O king, is the
first of the qualities of the rice field he ought to have.

8\. 'And again, O king, just as the rice field is provided with
embankments whereby men keep the water in, and so bring the crop to
maturity; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, be provided with the embankments of righteousness of life, and
shame at sin, and thereby keep his Sama*n*aship intact, and gain the
fruits thereof. This, O king, is the second quality of the rice field he
ought to have.

9\. 'And again, O king, just as the rice field is fruitful, filling the
heart of the farmer with joy, so that if the seed be little the crop is
great, and if the seed be much the crop is greater still; just so, O
king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be fruitful to
the bearing of much good fruit, making the hearts of those who support
him to rejoice, so that where little is given the result is great, and
where much is given the result is greater still.

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

\[paragraph continues\] This, O king, is the third quality of the rice
field he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Upâli, the Elder, he
who carried the rules of the Order in his head:

"Be fruitful as a rice field, yea, be rich  
In all good works! For that is the best field  
Which yieldeth to the sower the goodliest crop <span
id="fr_858"></span>[1](#fn_849.md)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 65. MEDICINE.

10\. \[**417**\] 'Venerable Nâgasena, those two qualities of medicine
you say he ought. to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as vermin are not produced in medicine; just so, O king,
should no evil dispositions be allowed to arise in the mind of the
strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort. This, O king, is the first of the
qualities of medicine he ought to have.

11\. 'And again, O king, just as medicine is an antidote to whatever
poison may have been imparted by bites or contact, by eating or by
drinking in any way; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu,
earnest in effort, counteract in himself the poison of lusts, and
malice, and dullness, and pride, and wrong belief, This, O king, is the
second of the qualities of medicine he ought to have. For it was said, O
king, by the Blessed One, the god over all the gods:

"The strenuous recluse who longs to see  
Into the nature, and the meaning true,  
Of the constituent elements of things,  
Must as it were an antidote become,  
To the destruction of all evil thoughts <span
id="fr_859"></span>[1](#fn_849.md)."'

 

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

### 66. FOOD.

12\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those three qualities of food you say he ought
to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as food is the support of all beings, just so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be a handle, as it
were, by which all beings may open the door of the noble eightfold path.
This, O king, is the first of the qualities of food he ought to have.

13\. 'And again, O king, just as food increases people's strength; just
so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, grow in
increase of virtue. This, O king, is the second of the qualities of food
he ought to have.

14\. 'And again, O king, just as food is a thing desired of all beings;
just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be
desired of all the world. This, O king, is the third of the qualities of
food he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Mahâ Moggallâna, the
Elder:

"By self-restraint, training, and righteousness,  
By duty done, and by attainments reached,  
The strenuous recluse should make himself  
To all men in the world a thing desired <span
id="fr_860"></span>[1](#fn_850.md)"'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 67. THE ARCHER.

15\. \[**418**\] 'Venerable Nâgasena, those four qualities of the archer
you say he ought to take, which are they?'

Just, O king, as the archer, when discharging

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

his arrows, plants both his feet firmly on the ground, keeps his knees
straight, hangs his quiver against the narrow part of his waist, keeps
his whole body steady, places both his hands firmly on the point of
junction (of the arrow on the bow), closes his fists, leaves no openings
between his fingers, stretches out his neck, shuts his mouth and one
eye <span id="fr_861"></span>[1](#fn_851.md), and takes aim <span
id="fr_862"></span>[2](#fn_852.md) in joy at the thought: "I shall hit
it <span id="fr_863"></span>[3](#fn_853.md);" just so, O king, should the
strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, plant firmly the feet of his zeal
on the basis of righteousness, keep intact his kindness and tenderness
of heart, fix his mind on subjugation of the senses, keep himself steady
by self-restraint and performance of duty, suppress excitement and sense
of faintness, by continual thoughtfulness let no openings remain in his
mind, reach forward in zeal, shut the six doors (of the five senses and
the mind), and continue mindful and thoughtful in joy at the thought:
"By the javelin of my knowledge will I slay all my evil dispositions."
This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the archer he ought to
have.

16 .  <span id="fr_864"></span>[4](#fn_854.md)'And again, O king, as the
archer carries a vice <span id="fr_865"></span>[5](#fn_855.md) for
straightening out bent and crooked and

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

uneven arrows; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, carry about with him, so long as he is in the body, the vice of
mindfulness and thoughtfulness, wherewith he may straighten out any
crooked and bent and shifty ideas. This, O king, is the second of the
qualities of the archer he ought to have.

17\. 'And again, O king, as the archer practises <span
id="fr_866"></span>[1](#fn_856.md) at a target; just so, O king, should the
strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, practise, so long as he is in the
body. And how, O king, should he practise? He should practise himself in
the idea of the impermanence of all things, of the sorrow inherent in
individuality, in the absence in any thing or creature of any abiding
principle (any soul); in the ideas of the diseases, sores, pains, aches,
and ailments of the body that follow in the train of the necessary
conditions of individuality; in the ideas of its dependence on
others <span id="fr_867"></span>[2](#fn_857.md), and of its certain
disintegration <span id="fr_868"></span>[3](#fn_858.md); in the ideas of
the calamities, dangers, fears, and misfortunes to which it is subject;
of its instability under the changing conditions of life; of its
liability to dissolution, its want of firmness, its being no true place
of refuge, no cave of security, no home of protection, no right object
of trust; of its vanity, emptiness, danger, and insubstantiality
\[**419**\]; of its being the source of pains and subject to

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

punishments <span id="fr_869"></span>[1](#fn_859.md) and full of impurity,
a mongrel compound of conditions and qualities that have no coherence;
of its being the food alike of evil and of the Evil One <span
id="fr_870"></span>[2](#fn_860.md); of its inherent liability to rebirths,
old age, disease, and death, to griefs, lamentations, despair; and of
the corruption of the cravings and delusions that are never absent from
it. This, O king, is the third of the qualities of the archer he ought
to have.

18\. 'And again, O king, just as the archer practises early and late;
just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort,
practise meditation early and late. For it was said, O king, by
Sâriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:

"Early and late the true archer will practise,  
'Tis only by never neglecting his art,  
That he earns the reward and the wage of his skill.  
So the sons of the Buddha, too, practise their art.  
It is just by never neglecting in thought  
The conditions of life in this bodily frame  
That they gain the rich fruits which the Arahats love <span
id="fr_871"></span>[3](#fn_861.md)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here ends the fifth riddle, the riddle of the archer.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here end the two hundred and sixty-two questions of Milinda, as handed
down in the book in its six parts, adorned with twenty-two chapters. Now
those which have not been handed down are forty-

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

two <span id="fr_872"></span>[1](#fn_862.md). Taking together all those
that have been, and those that have not been, handed down, there are
three hundred plus four, all of which are reckoned as 'Questions of
Milinda <span id="fr_873"></span>[2](#fn_863.md).'

19\. On the conclusion of this putting of puzzles and giving of
solutions between the king and the Elder, this great earth, eighty-four
thousand leagues in extent, shook six times even to its ocean boundary,
the lightnings flashed, the gods poured down a rainfall of flowers from
heaven, Mahâ Brahmâ himself signified his applause, and there was a
mighty roar like the crashing and thundering of a storm in the mighty
deep. And on beholding that wonder, the five hundred high ministers of
the king, and all the inhabitants of the city of Sâgala who were there,
and the women of the king's palace, bowed down before Nâgasena, the
great teacher, raising their clasped hands to their foreheads, and
departed thence <span id="fr_874"></span>[3](#fn_864.md).

20\. \[**420**\] But Milinda the king was filled with joy of heart, and
all pride was suppressed within him. And he became aware of the virtue
that lay in the religion of the Buddhas, he ceased to have any doubt at
all in the Three Gems <span id="fr_875"></span>[4](#fn_865.md), he tarried
no longer in the jungle of heresy, he renounced all obstinacy; and
pleased beyond measure at the high

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

qualities of the Elder, at the excellence of his manners befitting a
recluse, he become filled with confidence, and free from cravings, and
all his pride and self-righteousness left his heart; and like a cobra
deprived of its fangs he said: 'Most excellent, most excellent,
venerable Nâgasena! The puzzles, worthy of a Buddha to solve, have you
made clear. There is none like you, amongst all the followers of the
Buddha, in the solution of problems, save only Sâriputta, the Elder,
himself, the Commander of the Faith. Pardon me, venerable Nâgasena, my
faults. May the venerable Nâgasena accept me as a supporter of the
faith, as a true convert from to-day onwards as long as life shall
last!'

21\. Thenceforward the king and his mighty men continued in paying
honour to Nâgasena. And the king had a Wihâra built called 'The Milinda
Wihâra,' and handed it over to Nâgasena, the Elder, and waited upon him
and all the multitude of the Arahat Bhikshus of whom he was the chief
with the four requisites of the Bhikshu's life. And afterwards, taking
delight in the wisdom of the Elder, he handed over his kingdom to his
son, and abandoning the household life for the houseless state, grew
great in insight, and himself attained to Arahatship! Therefore is it
said:

'Wisdom is magnified o'er all the world,  
And preaching for the endurance of the Faith.  
When they, by wisdom, have put doubt aside  
The wise reach upward to that Tranquil State.  
That man in whom wisdom is firmly set,  
And mindful self-possession never fails,  
He is the best of those who gifts receive,  
The chief of men to whom distinction's given. <span id="page_375">p.
375</span>  
Let therefore able men, in due regard  
To their own welfare <span id="fr_876"></span>[1](#fn_866.md), honour those
who're wise,--  
Worthy of honour like the sacred pile  
Beneath whose solid dome the bones of the great dead lie <span
id="fr_877"></span>[2](#fn_867.md).'

Here ends the book of the puzzles and the solutions of Milinda and
Nâgasena <span id="fr_878"></span>[3](#fn_868.md).

terms of archery, compare above, p. 352 (of the Pâli).

<span id="fn_854"></span>[370:4](sbe3615.htm#fr_864.md) From this point to
the end, Mr. Trenckner's text is taken from a MS. brought from Siam, as
explained in his Introduction, pp. v, vi, and in my Introduction, I,
xxiv. Hîna*t*i-kumburê gives no indication of any change here in the
MSS. he used.

<span id="fn_856"></span>[371:1](sbe3615.htm#fr_866.md) Upâseti (only found
here). Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 622, has abhyâsa karanneya. He gives the

Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 623.

<span id="fn_860"></span>[372:2](sbe3615.htm#fr_870.md) Marâmisato, given
by Hîna*t*i-kumburê both in the Pâli and Si*m*halese, but omitted by Mr.

thirty-eight in the list at VII, 1, r.

<span id="fn_863"></span>[373:2](sbe3615.htm#fr_873.md) Before these last
sentences (Now those . . . . . . Milinda), Hîna*t*i-kumburê has: 'Here
ends that mirror of the good law called, "The Questions of Milinda."'
Then he goes on as above.

<span id="fn_864"></span>[373:3](sbe3615.htm#fr_874.md) I here follow
Hîna*t*i-kumburê, who has apparently had a fuller text before him.

<span id="fn_865"></span>[373:4](sbe3615.htm#fr_875.md) The Buddha, his
religion, and his order.

<span id="fn_866"></span>[375:1](sbe3615.htm#fr_876.md) This line is
identical with the sixth line of the little poem on the gift of Wihâras
preserved in the *K*ullavagga VI, 1, 5, and VI, 9, 2, and quoted as a
whole in the *G*âtaka, book I, 93, and in part above IV, 5, 1. This line
also occurs, in a third connection, at *G*âtaka IV, 354.

<span id="fn_867"></span>[375:2](sbe3615.htm#fr_877.md) These verses differ
from those here given by Hîna*t*i-kumburê, which I have quoted in the
Introduction to this volume.

<span id="fn_868"></span>[375:3](sbe3615.htm#fr_878.md) This closing title
is omitted by Hîna*t*i-kumburê, who gives instead of it a second account
of how he came to write his translation, and then adds as the closing
title to his own book: 'Here ends the *S*rî Saddharmâdâsaya (the Mirror
of the Good Law) made by Sîna*t*i-kumburê Suma<u>n</u>gala, the Elder!
\[Sîna*t*i is merely the Elu form of the Si*m*halese word Hîna*t*i,
which is the name of a plant, coryza sativa; and Hîna*t*i-kumburê is the
locative of the name of the place, Hîna*t*i-field, where he was born.
Every unnânsê in Ceylon has such a local name in addition to his
religious name. And the religious names being often identical (there
are, for instance, many Suma<u>n</u>galas), the Bhikkhus are usually
spoken of by the former, and not by the latter.\]
