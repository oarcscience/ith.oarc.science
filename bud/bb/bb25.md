### Preface

THIS VERSION is based upon the English translation entitled: SUTRA
SPOKEN BY THE SIXTH PATRIARCH, WEI LANG, ON THE HIGH SEAT OF THE GEM OF
LAW made by Mr. Wong Mou-lam of Shanghai, and published by the Yu Ching
Press. To Mr. Wong great praise and credit should be given for his most
excellent reproduction of the meaning and spirit of the original. Mr.
Wong has very graciously given the editor permission to make changes in
its English dress, and to delete passages that a reasonable amount of
literary and historical criticism appear to make necessary, or that are
of slight interest to our times. As Mr. Wong is in far away Ceylon to
better fit himself for further translation work, there has been no
chance to talk over the changes with him and to secure his approval; the
editor, therefore, holds himself wholly responsible for them. Mr. Wong's
translation is technically more complete and accurate and for scholarly
research is to be preferred to this Version, but there is great need for
a simpler and more readable Version, for which need this was provided.

The Sixth Chinese Patriarch lived fifteen hundred years ago (637-713),
but his kindly and straight-forward insistence on the one thing:
"Self-realisation of your own mind-essence," places him among the
world's great teachers, and marks him out as one still worthy of
attention.
