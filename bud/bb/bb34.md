### Chapter IX

### Final Words and Death of the Patriarch

ON THE 1ST DAY of the 7th Moon, the Patriarch assembled his disciples
and addressed them as follows:--

'I am going to leave this world by the 8th Moon. Should any of you have
doubts about the teaching, please ask me soon, so that I may clear them
away before I go. You may not find any one to teach you after I am
gone." (The sad news moved many of them to tears. The Patriarch spoke to
them at some length) and then added:--

"Under all circumstances you should free yourselves from attachment to
objects; toward them your attitude should be neutral and indifferent.
Let neither success nor failure, neither profit nor loss, worry you. Be
ever calm and serene, modest and helpful, simple and dispassionate. The
Dharma is non-dual as is the mind also. The Path is pure and above all
'form.' You are especially warned not to let the exercise for
concentration of mind, fall into mere quiet thinking or into an effort
to keep the mind in a blank state. The mind is by nature pure, there is
nothing for us to crave or give up."

Realising that the Patriarch would pass away in the near future, Elder
Fat-hoi after prostrating himself twice asked, "Sir, upon your entering
into Parinirvana, who will be the inheritor of the robe and the (secret)
Dharma?"

"(As for the Dharma) all my sermons from the time I preached in the
Tai-fan Monastery up to now, may

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

be copied out for circulation. You should take good care of it and hand
it down from generation to generation for the salvation of all sentient
beings. He who preaches in accordance with its teaching preaches the
Orthodox Dharma. I have already made known to you, all the Dharma I
know.

"As to the transmission of the robe, this practice is to be
discontinued. Why? Because you all have implicit faith in my teaching,
you are all free from doubts, therefore, you are all able to carry out
the lofty object of our school. It is in accordance with the meaning of
the stanza, handed down by Bodhidharma, the First Patriarch, that the
robe be no longer handed down to posterity. The verse says:--

'*The object of my coming to China,  
Was to transmit the Dharma of deliverance to all under delusion.  
In five petals, the flower will be complete;  
Thereafter, fruit will come to maturity naturally*.'

\*        \*        \*

"Do your best each of you; go wherever circumstances lead you. Listen to
this stanza:--

"*With those who are sympathetic  
You may have discussion about Buddhism.  
As to those whose point of view differs from ours,  
Treat them politely and try to make them happy.  
Disputes are alien to our school,  
They are incompatible with its spirit*. <span id="page_313">p.
313</span>  
*To be bigoted and to argue with others in disregard of this rule  
Is to subject one's Mind-essence to the bitterness of this mundane
existence*."

\*        \*        \*

On the 8th day of the 7th Moon, the Patriarch suddenly gave an order to
his disciples to get a boat ready for his return to Sun-chow, (his
native place). They entreated him earnestly to remain where he was, but
in vain.

"It is only natural," said the Patriarch, "death is the inevitable
outcome of birth. Even the Buddhas as they appear in this world must
manifest an earthly death before they enter Parinirvana. There will be
no exception with me; my physical body must be laid down somewhere.
Fallen leaves go back to the place where the root is."

\*        \*        \*

On the 3rd day of the 8th Moon of the Year Kwai Tsau, the 2nd year of
the Sin Tan Era, after eating with his disciples at the Kwok-yen
Monastery (Sun-chow), the Patriarch spoke as follows:--

"Please sit down in order of seniority; I am going to say good bye to
you. After my passing away, do not follow the worldly custom of crying
and lamenting. Neither should messages of condolence be accepted, nor
should mourning be worn. These things are contrary to orthodox teaching;
he who does them is not my disciple. What you should do is to know your
own mind

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

and realise your own Buddha-nature, Which neither rests nor moves,
neither becomes nor ceases to be, neither comes nor goes, neither
affirms nor denies, neither remains nor departs. I repeat this to you
that you may surely realise your Mind-essence. If you carry out my
instructions after my death and practise them, then my going away will
make no difference with you. On the other hand, if you go against my
teachings, even if I remained with you, no benefit would be yours." Then
he uttered this stanza:--

"*Undisturbed and serene, the wise man practises no virtue;  
Self-possessed and dispassionate, he commits no sin;  
Calm and silent, he gives up seeing and hearing;  
Even and upright his mind abides nowhere*."

Having uttered the stanza, he sat reverently until the third watch of
the night, then he said abruptly, "I am going now," and in a moment
passed away. At that time, a peculiar fragrance pervaded the room and a
lunar rainbow appeared to link the earth and heaven; the trees in the
grove turned pale and birds and animals cried mournfully.

\*        \*        \*

In the 11th Moon of that year, the question of the Patriarch's resting
place gave rise to a dispute among the government officials of
Kwong-chow, Shiu-chow and Sun-chow, each arty being anxious to have the
remains of the Patriarch removed to his own district.

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

\[paragraph continues\] The Patriarch's disciples together with other
Bhikkhus and laymen, took part in the controversy. Being unable to come
to any agreement, they burnt incense and prayed to the Patriarch to
indicate by the drift of the smoke the place he himself would like to
rest. As the smoke turned directly to Tso-kai, the sacred shrine
together with the inherited robe and bowl were accordingly removed back
there on the 13th day of the 11th Moon.

Next year on the 25th day of the 7th Moon, the body was taken from the
shrine and re-embalmed and placed in the stupa, and by imperial order,
tablets were erected to record the life of the Patriarch.

\*        \*        \*

The Patriarch inherited the robe when he was 24; he was ordained at 39;
and died at the age of 76. For thirty-seven years he preached to the
benefit of all sentient beings. Forty-three of his disciples inherited
the Dharma; while those who attained (a measure of) enlightenment and
thereby got out of the rut of the ordinary life were too many to be
numbered. The robe transmitted by the First Patriarch, Bodhidharma, as
the insignia of the Patriarchship, the Mo La robe and the crystal bowl
presented by the Emperor Chung Chung, the Patriarch's image carved by
Fong-pin, and other sacred things, were given into the care of the
keeper of the stupa. They were to be kept permanently at Po-lam
Monastery to guard the welfare of the temple. The Sutra spoken by the
Patriarch was published and circulated to make known the principles of

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

the Dhyana School. All these steps were taken for the prosperity of the
"Three jewels," Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, as well as for the general
welfare of all sentient beings.

END OF THE SUTRA
