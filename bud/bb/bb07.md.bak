### Introduction

AS AN EXTENDED INTRODUCTION to the study of LANKAVATARA SUTRA has been
given by Prof. Suzuki in both his STUDIES and TRANSLATION, only a very
brief statement is necessary here.

Nothing is known as to its author, the time of its composition, or as to
its original form. There is a myth that it originally consisted of
100,000 verses, and the second chapter of the present text has a
footnote which reads: "Here ends the second chapter of the Collection of
all the Dharmas, taken from the Lankavatara of 36,000 verses."
Apparently it was originally a collection of verses covering all the
main teachings of Mahayana Buddhism. This vast collection of verses
became a source from which the Masters selected texts for their
discourses. As the verses were very epigrammatic, obscure and
disconnected, in the course of time the discourses were remembered and
the verses largely forgotten, until in the present text there are
remaining only 884 verses. The present text has every appearance of
being something in the way of a disciple's notebook in which he had
written down extracts or outlines of his master's discourses on some of
these verses.

It is generally felt that the present text must have been compiled early
in the First Century, probably a

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

little earlier than the AWAKENING OF FAITH by Ashvagosha, which
doctrinally it greatly resembles. The earliest date connected with it is
the date of the first Chinese translation made by Dharmaraksha about
A.D. 420 and which was lost before 700. Three other Chinese translations
have been made: one by Gunabhadra in 443; one by Bodhiruci in 513; and
one by Shikshananda about 700. There is also one Tibetan version.

The Sutra has always been a favorite with the Ch’an Sect (Zen, in Japan)
and has had a great deal to do with that sect's origin and development.
There is a tradition that when Bodhidharma handed over his begging-bowl
and robe to his successor that he also gave him his copy of the
*Lankavatara*, saying, that he needed no other sutra. In the early days
of the Ch’an Sect the Sutra was very much studied, but because of its
difficulties and obscurities it gradually dropped out of common use and
has been very much neglected for the past thousand years. But during
that time many of the great Masters have made it a subject of study and
many commentaries have been written upon it. Although other sutras have
been more commonly read none have been more influential in fixing the
general doctrines of Mahayana Buddhism, and in bringing about the
general adoption of Buddhism in China, Korea and Japan.

In closing just a paragraph must be given about the characteristic
teachings of the LANKAVATARA. It is not written as a philosophical
treatise is written, to establish a certain system of thought, but was
written to elucidate the profoundest experience that comes to

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

the human spirit. It everywhere deprecates dependence upon words and
doctrines and urges upon all the wisdom of making a determined effort to
attain this highest experience. Again and again it repeats with
variations the refrain: "Mahamati, you and all the
Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas should avoid the erroneous reasonings of the
philosophers and seek this self-realisation of Noble Wisdom." For this
reason the LANKAVATARA is to be classed with the intuitional scriptures
of the Orient, rather than with the philosophical literature of the
Occident. In China it combined easily with the accepted belief of the
Chinese in Laotsu's conception of the Tao and its ethical idealism to
make the Buddhism of China and Japan eminently austere and practical,
rather than philosophical and emotional.
