### Chapter IX

### The Fruit of Self- Realisation

MAHAMATI ASKED the Blessed One: Pray tell us, Blessed One, what is the
fruitage that comes with self -realisation of Noble Wisdom?

The Blessed One replied: First, there will come a clearing insight into
the meaning and significance of things and following that will come an
unfolding insight into the significance of the spiritual ideals
(*Paramitas*) by reason of which the Bodhisattvas will be able to enter
more deeply into the abode of imagelessness and be able to experience
the higher Samadhis and gradually to pass through the higher stages of
Bodhisattvahood.

After experiencing the "turning-about" in the deepest seat of
consciousness, they will experience other Samadhis even to the highest,
the Vajravimbopama, which belongs to the Tathagatas and their
transformations. They will be able to enter into the realm of
consciousness that lies beyond the consciousness of the mind-system,
even the consciousness of Tathagatahood. They will become endowed with
all the powers, psychic faculties, self-mastery, loving compassion,
skillful means, and ability to enter into other Buddha-lands. Before
they had attained self-realisation of Noble Wisdom they had been
influenced by the self-interests of egoism, but after they attain
self-realisation they will find themselves reacting spontaneously to the
impulses of a great and compassionate heart endowed

with skillful and boundless means and sincerely and wholly devoted to
the emancipation of all beings.

\*

MAHAMATI SAID: Blessed One, tell us about the sustaining power of the
Tathagatas by which the Bodhisattvas are aided to attain
self-realisation of Noble Wisdom?

The Blessed One replied: There are two kinds of sustaining power, which
issue from the Tathagatas and are at the service of the Bodhisattvas,
sustained by which the Bodhisattvas should prostrate themselves before
them and show their appreciation by asking questions. The first kind of
sustaining power is the Bodhisattva's own adoration and faith in the
Buddhas by reason of which the Buddhas are able to manifest themselves
and render their aid and to ordain them with their own hands. The second
kind of sustaining power is the power radiating from the Tathagatas that
enables the Bodhisattvas to attain and to pass through the various
Samadhis and Samapattis without becoming intoxicated by their bliss.

Being sustained by the power of the Buddhas, the Bodhisattva even at the
first stage will be able to attain the Samadhi known as the Light of
Mahayana. in that Samadhi Bodhisattvas will become conscious of the
presence of the Tathagatas coming from all their different abodes in the
ten quarters to impart to the Bodhisattvas their sustaining power in
various ways. As the Bodhisattva Vajragarbha was sustained in his

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

Samadhis and as many other Bodhisattvas of like degree and virtue have
been sustained, so all earnest disciples and masters and Bodhisattvas
may experience this sustaining power of the Buddhas in their Samadhis
and Samapattis. The disciple's faith and the Tathagata's merit are two
aspects of the same sustaining power and by it alone are the
Bodhisattvas enabled to become one with the company of the Buddhas.

Whatever Samadhis, psychic faculties and teachings are realised by the
Bodhisattvas, they are made possible only by the sustaining power of the
Buddhas; if it were otherwise, the ignorant and the simpleminded might
attain the same fruitage. Wherever the Tathagatas enter with their
sustaining power there will be music, not only music made by human lips
and played by human hands on various instruments, but there will be
music among the grass and shrubs and trees, and in mountains and towns
and palaces and hovels; much more will there be music in the hearts of
those endowed with sentiency. The deaf, dumb and blind will be cured of
their deficiencies and will rejoice in their emancipation. Such is the
extraordinary virtue of the sustaining power imparted by the Tathagatas.

By the bestowal of this sustaining power, the Bodhisattvas are enabled
to avoid the evils of passion, hatred and enslaving karma; they are
enabled to transcend the dhyana of the beginners and to advance beyond
the experience and truth already attained; they are enabled to
demonstrate the Paramitas; and finally, to attain the stage of
Tathagatahood. Mahamati, if it were not for this sustaining power, they
would relapse

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

into the ways and thoughts of the philosophers, easygoing disciples and
the evil-minded, and would thus fall short of the highest attainment.
For these reasons, earnest disciples and sincere Bodhisattvas are
sustained by the power of all the Tathagatas.

\*

THEN SAID MAHAMATI: It has been said by the Blessed One that by
fulfilling the six Paramitas, Buddhahood is realised. Pray tell us what
the Paramitas are, and how they are to be fulfilled?

The Blessed One replied: The Paramitas are ideals of spiritual
perfection that are to be the guide of the Bodhisattvas on the path to
self-realisation. There are six of them but they are to be considered in
three different ways according to the progress of the Bodhisattva on the
stages. At first they are to be considered as ideals for the worldly
life; next as ideals for the mental life; and, lastly, as ideals of the
spiritual and unitive life.

In the worldly life where one is still holding tenaciously to the
notions of an ego-soul and what concerns it and holding fast to
discriminations of dualism, if only for worldly benefits, one should
cherish ideals of charity, good behavior, patience, zeal, thoughtfulness
and wisdom. Even in the worldly life the practice of these virtues will
bring rewards of happiness and success.

Much more in the mind-world of earnest disciples and masters will their
practice bring joys of emancipation, enlightenment and peace of mind,
because the

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Paramitas are grounded on right-knowledge and
lead to thoughts of Nirvana, even if the Nirvana of their thoughts is
for themselves. In the mind-world the Paramitas become more ideal and
more sympathetic; charity can no longer be expressed in the giving of
impersonal gifts but will call for the more costly gifts of sympathy and
understanding; good behavior will call for something more than outward
conformity to the five precepts because in the light of the Paramitas
they must practise humility, simplicity, restraint and self-giving.
Patience will call for something more than forbearance with external
circumstances and the temperaments of other people: it will now call for
patience with one's self. Zeal will call for something more than
industry and outward show of earnestness: it will call for more
self-control in the task of following the Noble Path and in
manifestating the Dharma in one's own life. Thoughtfulness will give way
to mindfulness wherein discriminated meanings and logical deductions and
rationalisations will give way to intuitions of significance and spirit.
The Paramita of Wisdom (Prajna) will no longer be concerned with
pragmatic wisdom and erudition, but will reveal itself in its true
perfectness of All-inclusive Truth which is Love.

The third aspect of the Paramitas as seen in the ideal perfections of
the Tathagatas can only be fully understood by the
Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas who are devoted to the highest spiritual
discipline and have fully understood that there is nothing to be seen in
the world but that which issues from the mind itself; in whose minds the
discriminations of dualities has ceased to function; and seizing and
clinging has become non-existent.

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Thus free from all attachments to individual
objects and ideas, their minds are free to consider ways of benefitting
and giving happiness to others, even to all sentient beings To the
Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas the ideal of charity is shown in the
self-yielding of the Tathagata's hope of Nirvana that all may enjoy it
together. While having relations with an objective world there is no
rising in the minds of the Tathagatas of discriminations between the
interests of self and the interests of others, between good and
evil,--there is just the spontaneity and effortless actuality of perfect
behavior. To practise patience with full knowledge of this and that, of
grasp and grasping, but with no thought of discrimination nor of
attachment,--that is the Tathagatas Paramita of Patience. To exert
oneself with energy from the first part of the night to its end in
conformity with the disciplinary measures with no rising of
discrimination as to comfort or discomfort,--that is the Tathagata's
Paramita of Zeal. Not to discriminate between self and others in
thoughts of Nirvana, but to keep the mind fixed on Nirvana,--that is the
Paramita of Mindfulness. As to the Prajna-Paramita, which is Noble
Wisdom, who can predicate it? When in Samadhi the mind ceases to
discriminate and there is only perfect and love-filled imagelessness,
then an inscrutable "turning-about" will take place in the inmost
consciousness and one will have attained self-realisation of Noble
Wisdom,--that is the highest Prajna-Paramita.

\*

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

THEN MAHAMATI SAID to the Blessed One: You have spoken of an
astral-body, a "mind-vision-body" (*manomayakaya*) which the
Bodhisattvas are able to assume, as being one of the fruits of
self-realisation of Noble Wisdom: pray tell us, Blessed One, what is
meant by such a transcendental body?

The Blessed One replied: There are three kinds of such transcendental
bodies: First, there is the one in which the Bodhisattva attains
enjoyment of the Samadhis and Samapattis. Second, there is the one which
is assumed by the Tathagatas according to the class of beings to be
sustained, and which achieves and perfects spontaneously with no
attachment and no effort. Third, there is the one in which the
Tathagatas receive their intuition of Dharmakaya.

The transcendental personality that enters into the enjoyment of the
Samadhis comes with the third, fourth and fifth stages as the mentations
of the mindsystem become quieted and waves of consciousness are no more
stirred on the face of Universal Mind. In this state, the conscious-mind
is still aware, in a measure, of the bliss being experienced by this
cessation of the mind's activities.

The second kind of transcendental personality is the kind assumed by the
Bodhisattvas and Tathagatas as bodies of transformation by which they
demonstrate their original vows in the work of achieving and perfecting;
it comes with the eighth stage of Bodhisattvahood. When the Bodhisattva
has a thorough-going penetration into the maya-like nature of things and
understands the dharma of imagelessness, he will experience the
"turning-about" in his deepest consciousness

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

and will become able to experience the higher Samadhis even to the
highest. By entering into these exalted Samadhis he attains a
personality that transcends the conscious-mind, by reason of which he
obtains supernatural powers of self-mastery and activities because of
which he is able to move as he wishes, as quickly as a dream changes, as
quickly as an image changes in a mirror. This transcendental body is not
a product of the elements and yet there is something in it that is
analogous to what is so produced; it is furnished with all the
differences appertaining to the world of form but without their
limitations; possessed of this "mind-vision-body" he is able to be
present in all the assemblages in all the Buddha-lands. Just as his
thoughts move instantly and without hindrance over walls and rivers and
trees and mountains, and just as in memory he recalls and visits the
scenes of his past experiences, so, while his mind keeps functioning in
the body, his thoughts May be a hundred thousand yojanas away. In the
same fashion the transcendental personality that experiences the Samadhi
Vajravimbopama will be endowed with supernatural powers and psychic
faculties and self-mastery by reason of which he will be able to follow
the noble paths that lead to the assemblages of the Buddhas, moving
about as freely as he may wish. But his wishes will no longer be
self-centered nor tainted by discrimination and attachment, for this
transcendental personality is not his old body, but is the
transcendental embodiment of his original vows of self-yielding in order
to bring all beings to maturity.

The third kind of transcendental personality is so

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

ineffable that it is able to attain intuitions of the Dharmakaya, that
is, it attains intuitions of the boundless and inscrutable cognition of
Universal Mind. As Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas attain the highest of the
stages and become conversant with all the treasures to be realised in
Noble Wisdom, they will attain this inconceivable transformation-body
which is the true nature of all the Tathagatas past, present and future,
and will participate in the blissful peace which pervades the Dharma of
all the Buddhas.
