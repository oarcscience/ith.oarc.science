### Preface

THIS SUTRA, under the title of MAHA-PRAJNA-PARAMITA-HRIDAYA, formed
another section of the great MAHA-PRAJNA-PARAMITA SUTRA. It is the
shortest of all the great Sutras and on that account was memorised by
all Buddhist monks and recited as part of the daily ritual, often many
times a day. It is no wonder that its teaching of "emptiness" entered
into the warp and woof of their thinking. In spite of the singleness of
its teaching, it will repay a lifetime of thoughtful meditation.
