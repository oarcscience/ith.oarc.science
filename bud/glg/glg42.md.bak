### 42. The Girl Comes Out from Meditation

In the time of Buddha Shakyamuni, Manjusri went to the assemblage of the
Buddhas. When he arrived there, the conference was over and each Buddha
had returned to his own Buddha-land. Only one girl was yet unmoved in
deep meditation.

Manjusri asked Buddha Shakyamuni how it was possible for this girl to
reach this state, one which even he could not attain. "Bring her out
from Samadhi and ask her yourself," said the Buddha.

Manjusri walked around the girl three times and snapped his fingers. She
still remained in meditation. So by his miracle power he transported her
to a high heaven and tried his best to call her, but in vain.

Buddha Shakyamuni said: "Even a hundred thousand Manjusris could not
disturb her, but below this place, past twelve hundred million
countries, is a Bodhisattva, Mo-myo, seed of delusion. If he comes here,
she will awaken."

No sooner had the Buddha spoken than that Bodhisattva sprang up from the
earth and bowed and paid homage to the Buddha. Buddha directed him to
arouse the girl. The Bodhisattva went in front of the girl and snapped
his fingers, and in that instant the girl came out from her deep
meditation.

 

*Mumon's comment:* Old Shakyamuni set a very poor stage. I want to ask
you monks: If Manjusri, who is supposed to have been the teacher of
seven Buddhas, could not bring this girl out of meditation, how then
could a Bodhisattva who was a mere beginner?

If you understand this intimately, you yourself can enter the great
meditation while you are living in the world of delusion.

*One could not awaken her, the other could.  
Neither are good actors.  
One wears the mask of god, one a devil's mask.  
Had both failed, the drama still would be a comedy*.
