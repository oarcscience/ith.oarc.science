### 39. Ummon's Sidetrack

A Zen student told Ummon: "Brilliancy of Buddha illuminates the whole
universe."

Before he finished the phrase Ummon asked: "You are reciting another's
poem, are you not?"

"Yes," answered the student.

"You are sidetracked," said Ummon.

Afterwards another teacher, Shishin, asked his pupils: "At what point
did that student go off the track?"

 

*Mumon's comment:* If anyone perceives Ummon's particular skillfulness,
he will know at what point the student was off the track, and he will be
a teacher of man and Devas. If not, he cannot even perceive himself.

*When a fish meets the fishhook  
If he is too greedy, he will be caught.  
When his mouth opens  
His life already is lost*.
