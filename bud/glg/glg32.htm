<p>A philosopher asked Buddha: "Without words, without the wordless, will you tell me truth?"</p>  
<p>The Buddha kept silence.</p>  
<p>The philosopher bowed and thanked the Buddha, saying: "With your loving kindness I have cleared away my delusions and entered the true path."</p>  
<p>After the philosopher had gone, Ananda asked the Buddha what he had attained.</p>  
<p>The Buddha replied: "A good horse runs even at the shadow of the whip."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>Mumon's comment:</i> Ananda was the disciple of the Buddha. Even so, his opinion did not surpass that of outsiders. I want to ask you monks: How much difference is there between disciples and outsiders?</p>
