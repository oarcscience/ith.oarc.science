<p>Tokusan went to the dining room from the meditation hall holding his bowl. Seppo was on duty cooking. When he met Tokusan he said: "The dinner drum is not yet beaten. Where are you going with your bowl?"</p>  
<p>So Tokusan returned to his room.</p>  
<p>Seppo told Ganto about this. Ganto said: "Old Tokusan did not understand ultimate truth."</p>  
<p>Tokusan heard of this remark and asked Ganto to come to him. "I have heard," he said, "you are not approving my Zen." Ganto admitted this indirectly. Tokusan said nothing.</p>  
<p>The next day Tokusan delivered an entirely different kind of lecture to the monks. Ganto laughed and clapped his hands, saying: "I see our old man understands ultimate truth indeed. None in China can surpass him."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>Mumon's comment:</i> Speaking about ultimate truth, both Ganto and Tokusan did not even dream it. After all, they are dummies.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><i>Whoever understands the first truth<br> Should understand the ultimate truth</i>. <br> <i>The last and first,<br> Are they not the same?</i></div></p>
