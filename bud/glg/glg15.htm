<p>Tozan went to Ummon. Ummon asked him where he had come from.</p>  
<p>Tozan said: "From Sato village." </p>  
<p>Ummon asked: "In what temple did you remain for the summer?"</p>  
<p>Tozan replied: "The temple of Hoji, south of the lake."</p>  
<p>"When did you leave there?" asked Ummon, wondering how long Tozan would continue with such factual answers.</p>  
<p>"The twenty-fifth of August," answered Tozan.</p>  
<p>Ummon said: "I should give you three blows with a stick, but today I forgive you."</p>  
<p>The next day Tozan bowed to Ummon and asked: "Yesterday you forgave me three blows. I do not know why you thought me wrong."</p>  
<p>Ummon, rebuking Tozan's spiritless responses, said: "You are good for nothing. You simply wander from one monastery to another."</p>  
<p>Before Ummon's words were ended Tozan was enlightened.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>Mumon's comment:</i> Ummon fed Tozan good Zen food. If Tozan can digest it, Ummon may add another member to his family.</p>  
<p>In the evening Tozan swam around in a sea of good and bad, but at dawn Ummon crushed his nut shell. After all, he wasn't so smart.</p>  
<p>Now, I want to ask: Did Tozan deserve the three blows? If you say yes, not only Tozan but every one of you deserves them. If you say no, Ummon is speaking a lie. If you answer this question clearly, you can eat the same food as Tozan.</p>
