### 24. Without Words, Without Silence

A monk asked Fuketsu: "Without speaking, without silence, how can you
express the truth?"

Fuketsu observed: "I always remember springtime in southern China. The
birds sing among innumerable kinds of fragrant flowers."

 

*Mumon's comment:* Fuketsu used to have lightning Zen. Whenever he had
the opportunity, he flashed it. But this time he failed to do so and
only borrowed from an old Chinese poem. Never mind Fuketsu's Zen. If you
want to express the truth, throw out your words, throw out your silence,
and tell me about your own Zen.

*Without revealing his own penetration,  
He offered another's words, not his to give*.  
*Had he chattered on and on,  
Even his listeners would have been embarrassed*.
