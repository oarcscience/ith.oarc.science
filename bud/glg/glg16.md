### 16. Bells and Robes

Ummon asked: "The world is such a wide world, why do you answer a bell
and don ceremonial robes?"

 

*Mumon's comment:* When one studies Zen one need not follow sound or
color or form. Even though some have attained insight when hearing a
voice or seeing a color or a form, this is a very common way. It is not
true Zen. The real Zen student controls sound, color, form, and
actualizes the truth in his everyday life.

Sound comes to the ear, the ear goes to sound. When you blot out sound
and sense, what do you understand? While listening with ears one never
can understand. To understand intimately one should see sound.

*When you understand, you belong to the family;  
When you do not understand, you are a stranger.  
Those who do not understand belong to the family,  
And when they understand they are strangers*.
