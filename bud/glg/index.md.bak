This classic Zen Buddhist collection of 49 koans with commentary by
Mumon was originally published in 1934, and later included in Paul Reps
and Nyogen Senzaki's popular anthology Zen Flesh, Zen Bones. Due to
non-renewal it is currently in the public domain in the US (although
other parts of Zen Flesh, Zen Bones are not).

Koans are a Zen Buddhist spiritual technique which use word-play to
achieve enlightenment. They frequently involve absurd or contradictory
statements, which are intended to create extreme cognitive dissonance in
the mind of the pupil. As such, their actual content or structure is not
as important as the mental state which they induce. This collection
includes some of the most famous koans, such as [Tozan's "three pounds
of flax"](glg18.md):

*What is the Buddha? -- This flax weighs three pounds.*

and [Baso's conundrum](glg33.md):

*What is Buddha? -- This mind is not Buddha.*

as well as some involving bizarre behavior, such as [Nansen Cuts the Cat
in Two](glg14) and [Blow out the Candle](glg28.md).

While short and succinct, this book has enormous depth, and offers new
rewards on repeated readings.
