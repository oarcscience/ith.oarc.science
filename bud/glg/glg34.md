### 34. Learning Is Not the Path

Nansen said: "Mind is not Buddha. Learning is not the path."

 

*Mumon's comment:* Nansen was getting old and forgot to be ashamed. He
spoke out with bad breath and exposed the scandal of his own home.
However, there are few who appreciate his kindness.

*When the sky is clear the sun appears,  
When the earth is parched rain will fall.  
He opened his heart fully and spoke out,  
But it was useless to talk to pigs and fish*.
