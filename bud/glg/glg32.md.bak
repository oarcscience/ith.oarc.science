### 32. A Philosopher Asks Buddha

A philosopher asked Buddha: "Without words, without the wordless, will
you tell me truth?"

The Buddha kept silence.

The philosopher bowed and thanked the Buddha, saying: "With your loving
kindness I have cleared away my delusions and entered the true path."

After the philosopher had gone, Ananda asked the Buddha what he had
attained.

The Buddha replied: "A good horse runs even at the shadow of the whip."

 

*Mumon's comment:* Ananda was the disciple of the Buddha. Even so, his
opinion did not surpass that of outsiders. I want to ask you monks: How
much difference is there between disciples and outsiders?

*To tread the sharp edge of a sword,  
To run on smooth-frozen ice,  
One needs no footsteps to follow.  
Walk over the cliffs with hands free*.
