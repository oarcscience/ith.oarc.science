<p>Hogen of Seiryo monastery was about to lecture before dinner when he noticed that the bamboo screen lowered for meditation had not been  rolled up. He pointed to it. Two monks arose from the audience and rolled it up.</p>  
<p>Hogen, observing the physical moment, said: "The state of the first monk is good, not that of the other."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>Mumon's comment:</i> I want to ask you: Which of those two monks gained and which lost? If any of you has one eye, he will see the failure on the teacher's part. However, I am not discussing gain and loss.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><i>When the screen is rolled up the great sky opens,<br> Yet the sky is not attuned to Zen.<br> It is best to forget the great sky<br> And to retire from every wind</i>.</div></p>
