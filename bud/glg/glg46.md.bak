### 46. Proceed from the Top of the Pole

Sekiso asked: "How can you proceed on from the top of a hundred-foot
pole?" Another Zen teacher said: "One who sits on the top of a
hundred-foot pole has attained a certain height but still is not
handling Zen freely. He should proceed on from there and appear with his
whole body in the ten parts of the world."

 

*Mumon's comment:* One can continue his steps or turn his body freely
about on the top of the pole. In either case he should be respected. I
want to ask you monks, however: How will you proceed from the top of
that pole? Look out!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*The man who lacks the third eye of insight  
Will cling to the measure of the hundred feet.  
Such a man will jump from there and kill himself,  
Like a blind man misleading other blind men*.
