### 27. It Is Not Mind, It Is Not Buddha, It Is Not Things

A monk asked Nansen: "Is there a teaching no master ever preached
before?"

Nansen said: "Yes, there is."

"What is it?" asked the monk.

Nansen replied: "It is not mind, it is not Buddha, it is not things."

 

*Mumon's comment:* Old Nansen gave away his treasure-words. He must have
been greatly upset.

*Nansen was too kind and lost his treasure.  
Truly, words have no power*.  
*Even though the mountain becomes the sea,  
Words cannot open another's mind*.
