### 5. Kyogen Mounts the Tree

Kyogen said: "Zen is like a man hanging in a tree by his teeth over a
precipice. His hands grasp no branch, his feet rest on no limb, and
under the tree another person asks him: 'Why did Bodhidharma come to
China from India?'

"If the man in the tree does not answer, he fails; and if he does
answer, he falls and loses his life. Now what shall he do?"

 

*Mumon's comment:* In such a predicament the most talented eloquence is
of no use. If you have memorized all the sutras, you cannot use them.
When you can give the right answer, even though your past road was one
of death, you open up a new road of life. But if you cannot answer, you
should live ages hence and ask the future Buddha, Maitreya.

*Kyogen is truly a fool  
Spreading that ego-killing poison  
That closes his pupils' mouths  
And lets their tears stream from their dead eyes*.
