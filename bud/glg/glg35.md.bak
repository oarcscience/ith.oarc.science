### 35. Two Souls

"Seijo, the Chinese girl," observed Goso, "had two souls, one always
sick at home and the other in the city, a married woman with two
children. Which was the true soul?"

 

*Mumon's comment:* When one understands this, he will know it is
possible to come out from one shell and enter another, as if one were
stopping at a transient lodging house. But if he cannot understand, when
his time comes and his four elements separate, he will be just like a
crab dipped in boiling water, struggling with many hands and legs. In
such a predicament he may say: "Mumon did not tell me where to go!" but
it will be too late then.

*The moon above the clouds is the same moon,  
The mountains and rivers below are all different.  
Each is happy in its unity and variety.  
This is one, this is two*.
