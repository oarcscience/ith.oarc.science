### 44. Basho's Staff

Basho said to his disciple: "When you have a staff, I will give it to
you. If you have no staff, I will take it away from you."

 

*Mumon's comment:* When there is no bridge over the creek the staff will
help me. When I return home on a moonless night the staff will accompany
me. But if you call this a staff, you will enter hell like an arrow.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*With this staff in my hand  
I can measure the depths and shallows of the world.  
The staff supports the heavens and makes firm the earth.  
Everywhere it goes the true teaching will be spread*.
