### 18. Tozan's Three Pounds

A monk asked Tozan when he was weighing some flax: "What is Buddha?"

Tozan said: "This flax weighs three pounds."

 

*Mumon's comment:* Old Tozan's Zen is like a clam. The minute the shell
opens you see the whole inside. However, I want to ask you: Do you see
the real Tozan?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*Three pounds of flax in front of your nose,  
Close enough, and mind is still closer.  
Whoever talks about affirmation and negation  
Lives in the right and wrong region*.
