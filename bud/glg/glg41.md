### 41. Bodhidharma Pacifies the Mind

Bodhidharma sits facing the wall. His future successor stands in the
snow and presents his severed arm to Bodhidharma. He cries: "My mind is
not pacified. Master, pacify my mind."

Bodhidharma says: "If you bring me that mind, I will pacify it for you."

The successor says: "When I search my mind I cannot hold it."

Bodhidharma says: "Then your mind is pacified already."

 

*Mumon's comment:* That broken-toothed old Hindu, Bodhidharma, came
thousands of miles over the sea from India to China as if he had
something wonderful. He is like raising waves without wind. After he
remained years in China he had only one disciple and that one lost his
arm and was deformed. Alas, ever since he has had brainless disciples.

Why did Bodhidharma come to China?  
For years monks have discussed this.  
All the troubles that have followed since  
Came from that teacher and disciple.
