### 36. Meeting a Zen Master on the Road

Goso said: "When you meet a Zen master on the road you cannot talk to
him, you cannot face him with silence. What are you going to do?"

 

*Mumon's comment:* In such a case, if you can answer him intimately,
your realization will be beautiful, but if you cannot, you should look
about without seeing anything.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*Meeting a Zen master on the road,  
Face him neither with words nor silence.  
Give him an uppercut  
And you will be called one who understands Zen*.
