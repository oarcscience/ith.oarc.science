### 6. Buddha Twirls a Flower

When Buddha was in Grdhrakuta mountain he turned a flower in his fingers
and held it before his listeners. Every one was silent. Only
Maha-Kashapa smiled at this revelation, although he tried to control the
lines of his face.

Buddha said: "I have the eye of the true teaching, the heart of Nirvana,
the true aspect of non-form, and the ineffable stride of Dharma. It is
not expressed by words, but especially transmitted beyond teaching. This
teaching I have given to Maha-Kashapa."

 

*Mumon's comment:* Golden-faced Gautama thought he could cheat anyone.
He made the good listeners as bad, and sold dog meat under the sign of
mutton. And he himself thought it was wonderful. What if all the
audience had laughed together? How could he have transmitted the
teaching? And again, if Maha-Kashapa had not smiled, how could he have
transmitted the teaching? If he says that realization can be
transmitted, he is like the city slicker that cheats the country dub,
and if he says it cannot be transmitted, why does he approve of
Maha-Kashapa?

*At the turning of a flower  
His disguise was exposed.  
No one in heaven or earth can surpass  
Maha-Kashapa's wrinkled face*.
