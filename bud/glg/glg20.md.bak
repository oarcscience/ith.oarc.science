### 20. The Enlightened Man

Shogen asked: "Why does the enlightened man not stand on his feet and
explain himself?" And he also said: "It is not necessary for speech to
come from the tongue."

 

*Mumon's comment:* Shogen spoke plainly enough, but how many will
understand? If anyone comprehends, he should come to my place and test
out my big stick. Why, look here, to test real gold you must see it
through fire.

*If the feet of enlightenment moved, the great ocean would overflow;  
If that head bowed, it would look down upon the heavens.  
Such a body has no place to rest. . . .  
Let another continue this poem*.
