### 11. Joshu Examines a Monk in Meditation

Joshu went to a place where a monk had retired to meditate and asked
him: "What is, is what?"

The monk raised his fist.

Joshu replied: "Ships cannot remain where the water is too shallow." And
he left.

A few days later Joshu went again to visit the monk and asked the same
question.

The monk answered the same way.

Joshu said: "Well given, well taken, well killed, well saved." And he
bowed to the monk.

 

*Mumon's comment:* The raised fist was the same both times. Why is it
Joshu did not admit the first and approved the second one? Where is the
fault?

Whoever answers this knows that Joshu's tongue has no bone so he can use
it freely. Yet perhaps Joshu is wrong. Or, through that monk, he may
have discovered his mistake.

If anyone thinks that the one's insight exceeds the other's, he has no
eyes.

*The light of the eyes is as a comet,  
And Zen's activity is as lightning.  
The sword that kills the man  
Is the sword that saves the man*.
