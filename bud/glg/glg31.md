### 31. Joshu Investigates

A traveling monk asked an old woman the road to Taizan, a popular temple
supposed to give wisdom to the one who worships there. The old woman
said: "Go straight ahead." When the monk proceeded a few steps, she said
to herself: "He also is a common church-goer."

Someone told this incident to Joshu, who said: "Wait until I
investigate." The next day he went and asked the same question, and the
old woman gave the same answer.

Joshu remarked: "I have investigated that old woman."

 

*Mumon's comment:* The old woman understood how war is planned, but she
did not know how spies sneak in behind her tent. Old Joshu played the
spy's work and turned the tables on her, but he was not an able general.
Both had their faults. Now I want to ask you: What was the point of
Joshu's investigating the old woman?

*When the question is common  
The answer is also common.  
When the question is sand in a bowl of boiled rice  
The answer is a stick in the soft mud*.
