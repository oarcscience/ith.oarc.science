I first visited a Chinese Buddhist temple in Shanghai. As a Californian,
I was much more familiar with Zen Buddhism, so this was something
entirely new to me. Instead of an aesthetics of austerity and clean
lines, this was Baroque and mysterious. The temple was filled with
statues of Buddhas, gods, goddesses and demons. I was reminded of the
Hindu temples of India, or the cathedrals of Mexico.

As I transcribed this book, that first collision with Chinese Buddhism
came back to me. Edkins' book is a comprehensive survey of Chinese
Buddhism. He gives the historical background of the introduction of
Buddhism into China, and its subsequent evolution, including biographies
of the Buddhist Patriarchs. There are extensive descriptions of Chinese
Buddhist geography and cosmology, the calendar of festivals, temple
architecture, and the vast array of entities which are represented in
sacred spaces. Of interest is his discussion of Kwan-yin, the Chinese
Madonna, who began as a male Buddha and evolved into a goddess figure.
There is a critical [essay on Feng-shui](cbu26), with details of this
form of Chinese geomancy and how it developed. He enumerates dozens of
Chinese Buddhist sacred texts, and provides translations of some
excerpts. Edkins was a skilled linguist and explains how Sanskrit terms
were transferred into Chinese. He also discusses Confucian, Taoist and
other Chinese belief systems.

Edkins was a Christian missionary, and his primary concern at times
appears to be how to *convert* Chinese Buddhists. But the sheer amount
of facts which he includes here far outweigh the occasional polemic
sidebar. This volume, which is still in print over a century later, is a
valuable reference work for anyone studying Chinese Buddhism, as well as
a snapshot of China in the late 19th century.
