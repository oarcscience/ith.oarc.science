THE Publishers have to acknowledge the efficient and disinterested aid
they have received from Mr. A. Wylie, late Agent of the British and
Foreign Bible Society in China, who, owing to the absence of the author
from England, has revised the proof sheets of this work in their passage
through the press; and they are also indebted to him for the preparation
of the copious and valuable index appended to it.
