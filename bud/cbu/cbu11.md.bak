IT was in the year A.D. 61, that the Chinese emperor Ming-ti, in
consequence of a dream, in which he saw the image of a foreign god, sent
messengers to India, a country

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

several thousand miles to the south-east of the capital, to ask for
Buddhist books and teachers. <span id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_38.md) A
native of Central India named Kashiapmadanga, with others, accompanied
them back. He translated a small but important Sutra, called the Sutra
of Forty-two Sections, and died at Lo-yang. The religion had now long
been established in Nepaul and Independent Tartary, as the travels of
the patriarchs indicate. It had also extended itself throughout India
and Ceylon, and the persecution of the Brahmans, instigated partly by
controversial feeling, and more by a desire to increase their caste
influence, had not yet commenced. Long before this, it is stated that in
B.C. 217, Indians had arrived at the capital of China in Shen-si, in
order to propagate their religion. Remusat, after mentioning this in the
*Foĕ* *kouĕ ki*, adds that, towards the year B.C. 122, a warlike
expedition of the Chinese led them to Hieou-thou, a country beyond
Yarkand. Here a golden statue was taken, and brought to the emperor. The
Chinese author states that this was the origin of the statues of Buddha
that were afterwards in use.

At this period the geographical knowledge of the Chinese rapidly
increased. The name of India now occurs for the first time in their
annals. In the year B.C. 122 Chang K‘ien, a Chinese ambassador, returned
from the country of the Getæ, and informed the Han emperor Wu-ti, of the
kingdoms and customs existing in the west. Among other things, he said,
"When I was in the country of the Dahæ, <span
id="fr_39"></span>[2](#fn_39.md) 12,000 Chinese miles distant to the
south-west, I saw bamboo staves from K’iung and cloth from Sï-ch’uen. On
asking whence they came, I was told that they were articles of traffic
at *Shin-do* ('Scinde,' a country far to

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

the south-east of the Dahæ)." It is added in the commentary to the
*T’ung-kien-kang-muh*, that the name is also pronounced, *Kan-do* and
*T’in-do*, and that it is the country of the barbarians called Buddha.

Early in the fourth century, native Chinese began to take the Buddhist
monastic vows. Their history says, under the year 335, that the prince
of the Ch’au kingdom in the time of the Eastern Ts’in dynasty, permitted
his subjects to do so. He was influenced by an Indian named
Buddojanga, <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md) who pretended to magical
powers. Before this, natives of India had been allowed to build temples
in the large cities, but it was now for the first time that the people
of the country were suffered to become "Shamen" <span
id="fr_41"></span>[2](#fn_41) (*Shramanas*.md), or disciples of Buddha. The
first translations of the Buddhist books had been already made, for we
read that at the close of the second century, an Indian residing at
Ch’ang-an, the modern Si-an fu, produced the first version of the "Lotus
of the Good Law." The emperor Hiau Wu, of the Ts’in dynasty, in the year
A.D. 381, erected a pagoda in his palace at Nanking.

At this period, large monasteries began to be established in North
China, and nine-tenths of the common people, says the historian,
followed the faith of the great Indian sage.

Under the year A.D. 405, the Chinese chronicles record that the king of
the Ts’in country gave a high office to Kumarajiva, an Indian Buddhist.
This is an important epoch for the history of Chinese Buddhist
literature. Kumarajiva was commanded by the emperor to translate the
sacred books of India, and to the present day his name may be seen on
the first page of the principal Buddhist classics. The seat of the
ancient kingdom of Ts’in was in the southern

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

part of the provinces Shen-si and Kan-su. Ch’au, another kingdom where,
a few years previously, Buddhism was in favour at court, was in the
modern Pe-chi-li and Shan-si. That this religion was then flourishing in
the most northerly provinces of the empire, and that the date, place
(Ch’ang-an), and other circumstances of the translations are preserved,
are facts that should be remembered in connection with the history of
the Chinese language. The numerous proper names and other words
transferred from Sanscrit, and written with the Chinese characters, are
of great assistance in ascertaining what sounds were then given to those
characters in the region where Mandarin is now spoken.

Kumarajiva was brought to China from Kui-tsi, a kingdom in Thibet, east
of the Ts’ung-ling mountains. The king of Ts’in had sent an army to
invade that country, with directions not to return without the Indian
whose fame had spread among all the neighbouring nations. The former
translations of the Buddhist sacred books were to a great extent
erroneous. To produce them in a form more accurate and complete was the
task undertaken by the learned Buddhist just mentioned, at the desire of
the king. More than eight hundred priests were called to assist, and the
king himself, an ardent disciple of the new faith, was present at the
conference, holding the old copies in his hand as the work of correction
proceeded. More than three hundred volumes were thus prepared. <span
id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md)

While this work, so favourable to the progress of Buddhism, was
proceeding, a Chinese traveller, Fa-hien, was exploring India and
collecting books. The extension of the religion that was then propagated
with such zeal and fervour very much promoted the mutual intercourse of
Asiatic countries. The road between Eastern Persia and China was
frequently traversed, and a succession of Chinese Buddhists thus found
their way to the parent

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

land of the legends and superstitions in which they believed. Several of
them on their return wrote narratives of what they had seen. Among those
that have been preserved, the oldest of them, the *Account of Buddhist
Kingdoms*, <span id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43.md) by Fa-hien, is perhaps
the most interesting and valuable. He describes the flourishing
condition of Buddhism in the steppes of Tartary, among the Ouighours and
the tribes residing west of the Caspian Sea, in Afghanistan where the
language and customs of Central India then prevailed, and the other
lands watered by the Indus and its tributary rivers, in Central India
and in Ceylon. Going back by sea from Ceylon, he reached Ch‘ang-an in
the year 414, after fifteen years’ absence. He then undertook with the
help of Palats’anga, a native of India, the task of editing the works he
had brought with him, and it was not till several years had elapsed that
at the request of Kumarajiva, his religious instructor, he published his
travels. The earnestness and vigour of the Chinese Buddhists at that
early period, is shown sufficiently by the repeated journeys that they
made along the tedious and dangerous route by Central Asia to India.
Neither religion nor the love of seeing foreign lands, are now enough,
unless the emperor commands it, to induce any of the educated class
among them to leave their homes. Fa-hien had several companions, but
death and other causes gradually deprived him of them all.

The Ts’in dynasty now fell (A.D. 420), and with it in quick succession
the petty kingdoms into which China was at that time divided. The
northern provinces became the possession of a powerful Tartar family,
known in history as the Wei dynasty. A native dynasty, the first of the
name Sung, ruled in the southern provinces. The princes of these
kingdoms were at first hostile to Buddhism.

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Image making and
the building of temples were forbidden, and in the north professors of
the prohibited religion were subjected to severe persecution. The people
were warned against giving them shelter, and in the year 426 an edict
was issued against them, in accordance with which the books and images
of Buddha were destroyed, and many priests put to death. To worship
foreign divinities, or construct images of earth or brass, was made a
capital crime. The eldest son of the Tartar chief of the Wei kingdom
made many attempts to induce his father to deal less harshly towards a
religion to which he himself was strongly attached, but in vain.

The work of this king was undone by his successor who, in the year A.D.
451, issued an edict permitting a Buddhist temple to be erected in each
city, and forty or fifty of the inhabitants to become priests. The
emperor himself performed the tonsure for some who took the monastic
vows.

The rapid advancement of Buddhism in China was not unnoticed in
neighbouring kingdoms. The same prosperity that awoke the jealousy of
the civil government in the country itself, occasioned sympathy
elsewhere. Many embassies came from the countries lying between India
and China during the time of Sung Wen-ti. whose reign of more than
thirty years closed in 453. Their chief object was to congratulate the
ruling emperor on the prosperity of Buddhism in his dominions, and to
pave the way for frequent intercourse on the ground of identity in
religion. Two letters of Pishabarma, king of Aratan, to this emperor are
preserved in the history of this dynasty. He describes his kingdom as
lying in the shadow of the Himalayas, whose snows fed the streams that
watered it. He praises China <span id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md) as the
most prosperous of kingdoms, and its rulers

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

as the benefactors and civilisers of the world. The letter of the king
of Jebabada, another Indian monarch, expresses his admiration of the
same emperor in glowing language. He had given rest to the inhabitants
of heaven and earth, subjected the four demons, attained the state of
perfect perception, caused the wheel of the honoured law to revolve,
saved multitudes of living beings, and by the renovating power of the
Buddhist religion brought them into the happiness of the Nirvâna. Relics
of Buddha were widely spread—numberless pagodas erected. All the
treasures of the religion (Buddha, the Law, and the Priesthood) were as
beautiful in appearance, and firm in their foundations as the Sumeru
mountain. The diffusion of the sacred books and the law of Buddha was
like the bright shining of the sun, and the assembly of priests, pure in
their lives, was like the marshalled constellations of heaven. The royal
palaces and walls were like those of the Tauli heaven. In the whole
Jambu continent, there were no kingdoms from which embassies did not
come with tribute to the great Sung emperor of the Yang-cheu <span
id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45.md) kingdom. He adds, that though separated by
a wide sea, it was his wish

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

to have embassies passing and repassing between the two countries.

The extensive intercourse that then began to exist between China and
India may be gathered from the fact that Ceylon <span
id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md) also sent an embassy and a letter to Sung
Wen-ti. In this letter it is said, that though the countries are distant
three years’ journey by sea and land, there are constant communications
between them. The king also mentions the attachment of his ancestors to
the worship of Buddha.

The next of these curious memorials from Buddhist kings preserved in the
annals of the same Chinese emperor, is that from "Kapili" (Kapilavastu),
the birthplace of Shakyamuni, situated to the north-west of Benares.

The compiler of the Sung annals, after inserting this document, alludes
to the flourishing state of Buddhism in the countries from which these
embassies came, and in China itself. He then introduces a memorial from
a magistrate representing the disorders that had sprung from the
wide-spread influence of this religion, and recommending imperial
interference. That document says that "Buddhism had during four
dynasties been multiplying its images and sacred edifices. Pagodas and
temples were upwards of a thousand in number. On entering them the
visitor's heart was affected, and when he departed he felt desirous to
invite others to the practices of piety. Lately, however, these
sentiments of reverence had given place to frivolity. Instead of aiming
at sincerity and purity of life, gaudy finery and mutual jealousies
prevailed. While many new temples were erected for the sake of display,
in the most splendid manner, no one thought of rebuilding the old ones.
Official inquiries should be instituted to prevent further evils, and
whoever wished to cast brazen statues should first obtain permission
from the authorities."

A few years afterwards (A.D. 458) a conspiracy was detected in which a
chief party was a Buddhist priest.

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> An edict issued on
the occasion by the emperor says, that among the priests many were men
who had fled from justice and took the monastic vows for safety. They
took advantage of their assumed character to contrive new modes of doing
mischief. The fresh troubles thus constantly occurring excite the
indignation of gods and men. The constituted authorities, it is added,
must examine narrowly into the conduct of the monks. Those who are
guilty must be put to death. It was afterwards enacted that such monks
as would not keep their vows of abstinence and self-denial should return
to their families and previous occupations. Nuns were also forbidden to
enter the palace and converse with the emperor's wives.

The advances of Buddhism later in the fifth century were too rapid not
to excite much opposition from the literati of the time, and a religious
controversy was the result.

In the biography of Tsï Liang, a minister of state under the emperor
Ts’i Wu-ti (A.D. 483), there are some fragments of a discussion he
maintained in favour of Buddhism. He says, "If you do not believe in
'retribution of moral actions' (*yin-kwo*), then how can you account for
the difference in the condition of the rich and the poor?" His opponent
says, "Men are like flowers on trees, growing together and bent and
scattered by the same breeze. Some fall upon curtains and carpets, like
those whose lot is cast in palaces, while others drop among heaps of
filth, representing men who are born in humble life. Riches and poverty,
then, can be accounted for without the doctrine of retribution." To this
the advocate of Buddhism is said to have been unable to reply. He also
wrote on the destruction of the soul. Personating the Confucianists, he
says that, "The 'soul' (*shin*) is to the 'body' (*hing*) as sharpness
to the knife. The soul cannot continue to exist after the destruction of
the body, more than sharpness can remain when the knife is no more."
These extracts show that some of the Confucianists of that age denied
any providential retribution in the present or a

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

future life. Whatever may be thought of notions connected with ancestral
worship, and the passages in the classical books that seem to indicate
the knowledge of a separate life for the soul after death, they were too
imperfect and indistinct to restrain the literati from the most direct
antagonism on this subject with the early Buddhists. Holding such
cheerless views as they did of the destiny of man, it is not to be
wondered at that the common people should desert their standard, and
adopt a more congenial system. The language of daily life is now
thoroughly impregnated with the phraseology of retribution and a
separate state. All classes make use of very many expressions in common
intercourse which have been originated by Buddhism, thus attesting the
extent of its influence on the nation at large. And, as the Buddhist
immortality embraces the past as well as the future, the popular notions
and language of China extend to a preceding life as much as to a coming
one.

A distinct conception of the controversy as it then existed may be
obtained from the following extracts from an account of a native
Buddhist, contained in the biographical section of the *History of the
Sung dynasty:*—"The instructions of Confucius include only a single
life; they do not reach to a future state of existence, with its
interminable results. His disciple, in multiplying virtuous actions,
only brings happiness to his posterity. Vices do but entail greater
present sufferings as their punishment. The rewards of the good do not,
according to this system, go beyond worldly honour, nor does the
recompense of guilt include anything worse than obscurity and poverty.
Beyond the ken of the senses nothing is known; such ignorance is
melancholy. The aims of the doctrine of Shakya, on the other hand, are
illimitable. It saves from the greatest dangers, and removes every care
from the heart. Heaven and earth are not sufficient to bound its
knowledge. Having as its one sentiment, mercy seeking to save, the
renovation of all living beings cannot satisfy

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

it. It speaks of hell, and the people fear to sin; of heaven, and they
all desire its happiness. It points to the Nirvâna as the spirit's
'final home' (*ch’ang-kwei*, lit. 'long return'), and tells him of 'the
bodily form of the law' (*fa-shen*), <span id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47.md)
as that last, best spectacle, on which the eye can gaze. There is no
region to which its influence does not reach. It soars in thought into
the upper world. Beginning from a space no larger than the well's mouth
in a courtyard, it extends its knowledge to the whole adjacent mansion."
These sentiments are replied to, in the imaginary dialogue in which they
occur, by a Confucian, who says, "To be urged by the desire of heaven to
the performance of virtue, cannot bear comparison with doing what is
right for its own sake. To keep the body under restraint from the fear
of hell, is not so good as to govern the heart from a feeling of duty.
Acts of worship, performed for the sake of obtaining forgiveness of
sins, do not spring from piety. A gift, made to secure a hundredfold
recompense to the giver, cannot come from pure inward sincerity. To
praise the happiness of the Nirvâna promotes a lazy inactivity. To speak
highly of the beauty of the embodied ideal representation of Buddhist
doctrine, seen by the advanced disciple, tends to produce in men a love
of the marvellous. By your system, distant good is looked for, while the
desires of the animal nature, which are close at hand, are unchecked.
Though you say that the Bodhisattwa is freed from these desires, yet all
beings, without exception, have them." To these arguments for the older
Chinese system, the Buddhist comes forward with a rejoinder:—"Your
conclusions are wrong. Motives derived from a future state are necessary
to lead men to virtue. Otherwise how could the evil tendencies of the
present life be adjusted? Men will not act spontaneously and immediately
without

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

something to hope for. The countryman is diligent in ploughing his land,
because he expects a harvest. If he had no such hope, he would sit idle
at home, and soon go down for ever 'below the nine fountains.'" <span
id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48.md) The Confucian answers that "religion"
(*tau*) consisting in the repression of all desires, it is inconsistent
to use the desire of heaven as a motive to virtue.

The discussion is continued with great spirit through several pages,
turning entirely on the advantage to be derived from the doctrine of the
future state for the inculcation of virtue. The Buddhist champion is
called the teacher of the "black doctrine," and his opponent that of
"the white." The author, a Buddhist, has given its full force to the
Confucian reasoning, while he condemns without flinching the
difficulties that he sees in the system he opposes. The whole is
preserved in a beautifully finished style of composition, and is a
specimen of the valuable materials contained in the Chinese dynastic
histories for special inquiries on many subjects not concerned with the
general history of the country. It was with fair words like these, the
darker shades of Buddhism being kept out of view, that the contest was
maintained in those days by such as would introduce a foreign form of
worship, against the adherents to the maxims of Confucius. The author of
the piece was rewarded for it by the reigning emperor.

In the northern provinces Buddhism was now flourishing. The prince of
the Wei kingdom spared no expense in promoting it. History says, that in
the year 467 he caused an image to be constructed "forty-three feet" in
height (thirty-five English feet). A hundred peculs of brass, or more
than five tons, were used, and six peculs of gold. Four years after, he
resigned his throne to his son, and became a monk. When, about the same
time, the Sung emperor erected a magnificent Buddhist temple, he was
severely rebuked by some of his mandarins.

The time of Wu-ti, the first emperor of the Liang

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

dynasty, forms an era in the history of Chinese Buddhism, marked as it
was by the arrival in China of *Ta-mo* (Bodhidharma), the twenty-eighth
of the patriarchs, and by the extraordinary prosperity of the Buddhist
religion under the imperial favour.

At the beginning of the sixth century, the number of Indians in China
was upwards of three thousand. The prince of the Wei kingdom exerted
himself greatly to provide maintenance for them in monasteries, erected
on the most beautiful sites. Many of them resided at Lo-yang, the modern
Ho-nan fu. The temples had multiplied to thirteen thousand. The decline
of Buddhism in its motherland drove many of the Hindoos to the north of
the Himalayas. They came as refugees from the Brahmanical persecution,
and their great number will assist materially in accounting for the
growth of the religion they propagated in China. The prince of the Wei
country is recorded to have discoursed publicly on the Buddhist
classics. At the same time, he refused to treat for peace with the
ambassadors of his southern neighbour, the Liang kingdom. Of this the
Confucian historian takes advantage, charging him with inconsistency in
being attached to a religion that forbids cruelty and bloodshed, while
he showed such fondness for war.

Soon after this, several priests were put to death (A.D. 515) for
practising magical arts. This is an offence attributed more than once by
the Chinese historians to the early Buddhists. The use of charms, and
the claim to magical powers, do not appear to have belonged to the
system as it was left by Shakyamuni. His teaching, as Burnouf has shown,
was occupied simply with morals and his peculiar philosophy. After a few
centuries, however, among the additions made by the Northern Buddhists
to popularise the religion, and give greater power to the priests, were
many narratives full of marvels and impossibilities, falsely attributed
to primitive Buddhism. These works are called the *Ta-ch’eng*, or "Great
Development"

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sutras. Another
novelty was the pretence of working enchantments by means of
unintelligible formulæ, which are preserved in the books of the Chinese
Buddhists, as in those of Nepaul, without attempt at explanation. These
charms are called Dharani. They occur in the Great Development classics,
such as the "Lotus of the Good Law," *Miau-fa-lien-hwa-king*
(*Fa-hwa-king*), and in various Buddhist works. The account given in the
*T’ung-kien-kang-muh* of the professed magician who led the priests
referred to above, says that he styled himself *Ta-ch’eng*, used wild
music to win followers, taught them to dissolve all the ties of kindred,
and aimed only at murder and disturbance.

The native annotator says that *Ta-ch’eng* is the highest of three
states of intelligence to which a disciple of Buddha can attain, and
that the corresponding Sanscrit word, *Mahayana*, means "Boundless
revolution and unsurpassed knowledge." It is here that the resemblance
is most striking between the Buddhism of China and that of other
countries where it is professed in the north. These countries having the
same additions to the creed of Shakya, the division of Buddhism by
Burnouf into a Northern and Southern school has been rightly made. The
superadded mythology and claim to magical powers of the Buddhists, who
revere the Sanscrit as their sacred language, distinguish them from
their co-religionists who preserve their traditions in the Pali tongue.

In the year A.D. 518, Sung-yün was sent to India by the prince of the
Wei country for Buddhist books. He was accompanied by Hwei-sheng, a
priest. He travelled to Candahar, stayed two years in Udyana, and
returned with 175 Buddhist works. His narrative has been translated by
Professor Neumann into German.

In A.D. 526, Bodhidharma, after having grown old in Southern India,
reached Canton by sea. The propagation of Buddhism in his native country
he gave in charge to one of his disciples during his absence. He was
received with the honour due to his age and character, and immediately

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

invited to Nanking, where the emperor of Southern China, Liang Wu-ti,
held his court. The emperor said to him—"From my accession to the
throne, I have been incessantly building temples, transcribing sacred
books, and admitting new monks to take the vows. How much merit may I be
supposed to have accumulated?" The reply was, "None." The emperor: "And
why no merit?" The patriarch: "All this is but the insignificant effect
of an imperfect cause not complete in itself. It is the shadow that
follows the substance, and is without real existence." The emperor:
"Then what is true merit?" The patriarch: "It consists in purity and
enlightenment, depth and completeness, and in being wrapped in thought
while surrounded by vacancy and stillness. Merit such as this cannot be
sought by worldly means." The emperor: "Which is the most important of
the holy doctrines?" The patriarch: "Where all is emptiness, nothing can
be called 'holy' (*sheng*)." The emperor: "Who is he that thus replies
to me?" The patriarch: "I do not know." The emperor—says the Buddhist
narrator—still remained unenlightened. This extract exhibits Buddhism
very distinctly in its mystic phase. Mysticism can attach itself to the
most abstract philosophical dogmas, just as well as to those of a
properly religious kind. This state of mind, allying itself
indifferently to error and to truth, is thus shown to be of purely
subjective origin. The objective doctrines that call it into existence
may be of the most opposite kind. It grows, therefore, out of the mind
itself. Its appearance may be more naturally expected in the history of
a religion like Christianity, which awakens the human emotions to their
intensest exercise, while, in many ways, it favours the extended use of
the contemplative faculties, and hence the numerous mystic sects of
Church history. Its occurrence in Buddhism, and its kindred systems,
might with more reason occasion surprise, founded as they are on
philosophical meditations eminently abstract. It was reserved for the
fantastic genius of India to construct a religion out of three such
elements as

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

atheism, annihilation, and the non-reality of the material world; and,
by the encouragement of mysticism and the monastic life, to make these
most ultimate of negations palatable and popular. The subsequent
addition of a mythology suited to the taste of the common people was, it
should be remembered, another powerful cause, contributing, in
conjunction with these quietist and ascetic tendencies, to spread
Buddhism through so great a mass of humankind. In carrying out his
mystic views, Ta-mo discouraged the use of the sacred books. He
represented the attainment of the Buddhist's aim as being entirely the
work of the heart. Though he professed not to make use of books, his
followers preserved his apophthegms in writing, and, by the wide
diffusion of them, a numerous school of contemplatists was originated,
under the name of *Ch‘an-hio* (*dhyana* doctrine) and *Ch‘an-men*
(*dhyana* school).

Bodhidharma, not being satisfied with the result of his interview with
royalty, crossed the Yang-tsze keang into the Wei kingdom and remained
at Lo-yang. Here, the narrative says, he sat with his face to a wall for
nine years. The people called him the "Wall-gazing Brahman." <span
id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md) When it was represented to the Liang
emperor, that the great teacher, who possessed the precious heirloom of
Shakya, the symbol of the hidden law of Buddha, was lost to his kingdom,
he repented and sent messengers to invite him to return. They failed in
their errand. The presence of the Indian sage excited the more ardent
Chinese Buddhists to make great efforts to conquer the sensations. Thus
one of them, we are told, said to himself, "Formerly, for the sake of
religion, men broke open their bones and extracted the marrow, took
blood from their arms to give to the hungry, rolled their hair in the
mud, or threw themselves down a precipice to feed a famishing tiger.
What can I do?" Accordingly, while snow was falling, he exposed himself
to it till it had risen above his knees, when the patriarch observing
him, asked him what he hoped to

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

gain by it. The young aspirant to the victory over self wept at the
question, and said, "I only desire that mercy may open a path to save
the whole race of mankind." The patriarch replied, that such an act was
not worthy of comparison with the acts of the Buddhas. It required, he
told him, very little virtue or resolution. His disciple, stung with the
answer, says the legend, took a sharp knife, severed his arm, and placed
it before the patriarch. The latter expressed his high approval of the
deed, and when, after nine years’ absence, he determined to return to
India, he appointed the disciple who had performed it to succeed him as
patriarch in China. He said to him on this occasion, "I give you the
seal of the law as the sign of your adherence to the true doctrine
inwardly, and the *kasha* (robe worn by Buddhists) as the symbol of your
outward teaching. These symbols must be delivered down from one to
another for two hundred years after my death, and then, the law of
Buddha having spread through the whole nation, the succession of
patriarchs will cease." He further said, "I also consign to you the
*Lenga Sutra* in four sections, which opens the door to the heart of
Buddha, and is fitted to enlighten all living men." Ta-mo's further
instructions to his successor as to the nature and duties of the
patriarchate are fully detailed in the *Chï-yue-luh*. He died of old age
after five attempts to poison him, and was buried at the Hiung-er
mountains between Ho-nan and Shen-si. At this juncture Sung-yün, who had
been sent to India a few years previously for Buddhist books, returned,
and inspected the remains of Bodhidharma. As he lay in his coffin he
held one shoe in his hand. Sun;-yün asked him whither he was going. "To
the Western heaven," was the reply. Sung-yün then returned home. The
coffin was afterwards opened and found empty, excepting that one of the
patriarch's shoes was lying there. By imperial command, the shoe was
preserved as a sacred relic in the monastery. Afterwards in the T‘ang
dynasty it was stolen, and now no one knows where it is.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

The embassies from Buddhist kingdoms in the time of Liang Wu-ti afford
other illustrations of the passion for relics and mementoes of venerated
personages, encouraged by the Buddhist priests. The king of Bunam, the
ancient Siam, wrote to the emperor that he had a hair of Buddha, twelve
feet in length, to give him. Priests were sent from the Chinese court to
meet it, and bring it home. Three years before this, as the *History of
the Liang dynasty* informs us, in building, by imperial command, a
monastery and pagoda to king *A-yo* (Ashôka), a *sharira*, or "relic of
Buddha," had been found under the old pagoda, with a hair of a blue
lavender colour. This hair was so elastic that when the priests pulled
it, it lengthened *ad libitum*, and when let alone curled into a spiral
form. The historian quotes two Buddhist works in illustration. The
"Seng-ga Sutra" (*king*) says, that Buddha's hair was blue and fine. In
the San-mei-king, Shakya himself says, "When I was formerly in my
father's palace, I combed my hair, and measuring it, found that it was
twelve feet in length. When let go, it curled into a spiral form." This
description agrees, it is added, with that of the hair found by the
emperor.

In A.D. 523, the king of Banban sent as his tributary offering, a true
"sharira" (*she-li*) with pictures and miniature pagodas; also leaves of
the Bodhi, Buddha's favourite tree. The king of another country in the
Birmese peninsula had a dream, in which a priest appeared to him and
foretold to him that the new prince of the Liang dynasty would soon
raise Buddhism to the summit of prosperity, and that he would do wisely
if he sent him an embassy. The king paying no attention to the warning,
the priest appeared again in a second dream, and conducted the monarch
to the court of Liang Wu-ti. On awaking, the king, who was himself an
accomplished painter, drew the likeness of the emperor as he had seen
him in his dream. He now sent ambassadors and an artist with
instructions to paint a likeness of the Chinese monarch from life. On

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

comparing it with his own picture, the similarity was found to be
perfect.

This emperor, so zealous a promoter of Buddhism, in the year A.D. 527,
the twenty-sixth of his reign, became a monk and entered the Tung-tai
monastery in Nanking. The same record is made in the history two years
afterwards. As might be expected, this event calls forth a long and
severe critique from the Confucian historian. The preface to the history
of the dynasty established by this prince, consists solely of a lament
over the sad necessity of adverting to Buddhism in the imperial annals
of the nation, with an argument for the old national system, which is so
clearly right, that the wish to deviate from it shows a man to be wrong.
In reference to the emperor's becoming a priest, the critic says, "that
not only would the man of common intelligence condemn such conduct in
the ruler of a commonwealth, but even men like Bodhidharma would
withhold their approval."

A few years afterwards, the same emperor rebuilt the Ch’ang-ts’ien
monastery five *le* to the south of "Nanking," in which was the *tope*
(shrine for relics) of *A-yo* or Ashôka. The writer in the
*T‘ung-kien-kang-muh* adds, that a true relic of Buddha's body is
preserved near "Ming-cheu" (now Ningpo). Ashôka erected 80,000 topes, of
which one-nineteenth were assigned to China. The tope and relic here
alluded to are those of the hill *Yo-wang shan*, well known to foreign
visitors, and situated fifty-two *li* eastward of Ningpo. To Buddhist
pilgrims coming from far and near to this sacred spot, the *she-li* is
an object of reverential worship, but to unbelieving eyes it presents a
rather insignificant appearance. The small, reddish, beadlike substance
that constitutes the relic, is so placed in its lantern-shaped
receptacle, that it does not admit of much light being thrown upon it.
The colour is said to vary with the state of mind of the visitor. Yellow
is that of happiest omen. The theory is a safe one, for there is just
obscurity enough to render the tint of the

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

precious remains of Shakya's burnt body somewhat uncertain.

King Ashôka, to whom this temple is dedicated, was one of the most
celebrated of the Buddhist kings of India. Burnouf in his *Introduction
à l’Histoire du Buddhisme Indien*, has translated a long legend of which
Ashôka is the hero, and which is also contained in the Chinese work,
*Fa-yuen-chu-lin*. The commencement in the latter differs a little from
that given by Burnouf. Buddha says to Ananda, "You should know that in
the city 'Palinput' (Pataliputra), there will be a king named 'The moon
protected' (*Yue-hu*; in Sanscrit, *Chandragupta*). He will have a son
named Bindupala, and he again will have a son Susima." Ashôka was the
son of Bindupala by another wife, and succeeded his father as king. The
Indian king Sandracottus, who concluded a treaty with Seleucus Nicator,
the Greek king of Syria, B.C. 305, was identified with Chandragupta by
Schlegel and Wilson. According to the *Mahavanso*, the Pali history of
the Buddhist patriarchs, there was an interval of 854 years from
Buddha's death to the accession of Chandragupta, making that event to be
in B.C. 389, which is more than half a century too soon. Turnour thinks
the discrepancy cannot be accounted for but by supposing a wilful
perversion of the chronology. These statements are quoted in Hardy's
*Eastern Monachism*, from Wilson's *Vishnu Purana*. By this synchronism
of Greek and Indian literature, it is satisfactorily shown that Ashôka
lived in the second century before Christ, and Buddha in the fourth and
fifth. The commonly received chronology of the Chinese Buddhists is too
long, therefore, by more than five hundred years. <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md) Probably this fraud was effected to verify
predictions found in certain Sutras, in which Buddha is made to say that
in a definite number of years after his death, such and such things
would happen. The

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Northern Buddhists
wrote in Sanscrit, made use of Sanscrit Sutras, and were anxious to
vindicate the correctness of all predictions found in them. Burnouf
supposes that the disciples of Buddha, would naturally publish their
sacred books in more than one language; Sanscrit being then, and long
afterwards, spoken by the literati, while derived dialects were used by
the common people. By Fa-hien Ashôka is called *A-yo Wang*, as at the
monastery near Ningpo. In Hiuen-tsang's narrative, the name *Wu-yeu
wang*, the "Sorrowless king," a translation of the Sanscrit word, is
applied to him.

The Liang emperor Wu-ti, after three times assuming the, Buddhist vows
and expounding the Sutras to his assembled courtiers, was succeeded by a
son who favoured Tauism. A few years after, the sovereign of the Ts’i
kingdom endeavoured to combine these two religions. He put to death four
Tauist priests for refusing to submit to the tonsure and become
worshippers of Buddha. After this there was no more resistance. In A.D.
558 it is related that Wu-ti, an emperor of the Ch’in dynasty, became a
monk. Some years afterwards, the prince of the Cheu kingdom issued an
edict prohibiting both Buddhism and Tauism. Books and images were
destroyed, and all professors of these religions compelled to abandon
them.

The *History of the Northern Wei dynasty* contains some details on the
early Sanscrit translations in addition to what has been already
inserted in this narrative. <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md) The
pioneers in the work of translation were Kashiapmadanga and Chu-fa-lan,
who worked conjointly in the time of

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ming-ti. The
latter also translated the "Sutra of the ten points of rest." In A.D.
150, a priest of the "An-si" (Arsaces) country in Eastern Persia is
noticed as an excellent translator. About A.D. 170, Chitsin, a priest of
the Getæ nation, produced a version of the *Nirvâna Sutra*. Sun K’iuen,
prince of the Wu state, one of the Three Kingdoms, who, some time after
the embassy of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, the Roman emperor, to China,
received with great respect a Roman merchant at his court, <span
id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md) treated with equal regard an Indian priest
who translated for him some of the books of Buddha. The next Indian
mentioned is Dharmakakala, who translated the "Vinaya" or *Kiai-lü*
(Discipline) at Lo-yang. About A.D. 300, Chï-kung-ming, a foreign
priest, translated the *Wei-ma* and *Fa-hwa*, <span
id="fr_53"></span>[2](#fn_53.md) "Lotus of the Good Law Sutras," but the
work was imperfectly done. Tau-an, a Chinese Buddhist, finding the
sacred books disfigured by errors, applied himself to correct them. He
derived instruction from Buddojanga and wished much to converse with
Kumarajiva, noticed in a previous page. The latter, himself a man of
high intelligence, had conceived an extraordinary regard for him, and
lamented much when he came to Ch’ang-an from Liang-cheu at the
north-western corner of China where he had long resided, that Tau-an was
dead. Kumarajiva found that in the corrections he proposed to make in
the sacred books, he had been completely anticipated by his Chinese
fellow-religionist. Kumarajiva is commended for his accurate knowledge
of the Chinese language as well as of his own. With his assistants he
made clear the sense of many profound and extensive "Sutras" (*King*)
and "Shastras" (*Lun*), twelve works in all. The divisions into sections
and sentences were formed with care. The finishing touch to the Chinese
composition of these translations was given

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

by Seng-chau. Fa-hien in his travels did his utmost to procure copies of
the Discipline and the other sacred books. On his return, with the aid
of an Indian named Bhadra, he translated the *Seng-kï-lü* (*Asangkhyea
Vinaya*), which has since been regarded as a standard work.

Before Fa-hien's time, about A.D. 290, a Chinese named Chu Sï-hing went
to Northern India for Buddhist books. He reached Udin or Khodin,
identified by Remusat with Khoten, and obtained a Sutra of ninety
sections. He translated it in Ho-nan, with the title
*Fang-kwang-pat-nia-king* (Light-emitting Prajna Sutra). Many of these
books at that time so coveted, were brought to Lo-yang, and translated
there by Chufahu, a priest of the Getæ nation, who had travelled to
India, and was a contemporary of the Chinese just mentioned. Fa-ling was
another Chinese who proceeded from "Yang-cheu" (Kiang-nan) to Northern
India and brought back the Sutra *Hwa-yen-king* and the *Pen-ting-lü*, a
work on discipline. Versions of the "Nirvâna Sutra" (*Ni-wan-king*), and
the *Seng-ki-lü* were made by Chi-meng in the country *Kau-ch‘ang*, or
what is now "Eastern Thibet." The translator had obtained them at
*Hwa-shï* or "Pataliputra," a city to the westward. The Indian
Dharmaraksha brought to China a new Sanscrit copy of the *Nirvâna Sutra*
and going to Kau-ch‘ang, compared it with Chi-meng's copy for critical
purposes. The latter was afterwards brought to Ch‘ang-an and published
in thirty chapters. The Indian here mentioned, professed to foretell
political events by the use of charms. He also translated the
*Kin-kwang-king*, or "Golden Light Sutra," and the *Ming-king*, "Bright
Sutra." At this time there were several tens of foreign priests at
Ch‘ang-an, but the most distinguished among them for ability was
Kumarajiva. His translations of the *Wei-ma*, *Fa-hwa*, and
*C‘heng-shih* (complete) Sutras, with the three just mentioned, by
Dharmaraksha and some others, together form the *Great Development*
course of

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

instruction. The "Longer Agama Sutra" <span
id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md) and the "Discipline of the Four
Divisions" <span id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_55.md) were translated by
Buddhayasha, a native of India, the "Discipline of the Ten Chants" <span
id="fr_56"></span>[3](#fn_56.md) by Kumarajiva, the "Additional Agama
Sutra" by Dharmanandi, and the "Shastra of Metaphysics"
(*Abhidharma-lun*) by Dharmayagama. These together formed the *Smaller
Development* course. In some monasteries the former works were studied
by the recluses; in others the latter. Thus a metaphysical theology,
subdivided into schools, formed the subject of study in the Asiatic
monkish establishments, as in the days of the European school-men. The
Chinese travellers in India, and in the chain of Buddhist kingdoms
extending—before the inroads of Mohammedanism—from their native land
into Persia, give us the opportunity of knowing how widely there as well
as in China the monastic life and the study of these books were spread.
About A.D. 400, Sangadeva, a native of "Cophen" (*Kipin*), translated
two of the *Agama Sutras*. The "Hwa-yen Sutra" was soon afterwards
brought from Udin by Chi Fa-ling, a Chinese Buddhist, and a version of
it made at Nanking. He also procured the *Pen-ting-lü*, a work in the
*Vinaya* or "Discipline" branch of Buddhist books. Ma Twan-lin also
mentions a Hindoo who, about A.D. 502, translated some Shastras of the
Great Development (*Ta-ch‘eng*) school, called *Ti-ch‘ï-lun* (fixed
position), and *Shi-ti-lun* (the ten positions).

The Hindoo Buddhists in China, whose literary labours down to the middle
of the sixth century are here recorded, while they sometimes enjoyed the
imperial favour, had to bear their part in the reverses to which their
religion was exposed. Dharmaraksha was put to death for refusing to come
to court on the requisition of one of the Wei emperors. Sihien, a priest
of the royal family of the Kipin kingdom in Northern India, in times of
persecution assumed the disguise of a physician, and when the very
severe penal laws then enacted against Buddhism were

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

remitted, returned to his former mode of life as a monk. Some other
names might be added to the list of Hindoo translators, were it not
already sufficiently long.

About the year 460 it appears from the history that five Buddhists from
Ceylon arrived in China by the Thibetan route. Two of them were Yashaita
and Budanandi. They brought images. Those constructed by the latter had
the property of diminishing in apparent size as the visitor drew nearer,
and looking brighter as he went farther away. Though a literary
character is not attributed to them, the Southern Buddhist traditions
might, through their means, have been communicated at this time to the
Chinese. This may account for the date—nearly correct—assigned to the
birth of Buddha in the *History of the Wei dynasty*, from which these
facts are taken, and in that of the Sui dynasty which soon followed.

According to the same history there were then in China two millions of
priests and thirty thousand temples. This account must be exaggerated;
for if we allow a thousand to each district, which is probably over the
mark, there will be but that number at the present time, although the
population has increased very greatly in the interval. <span
id="fr_57"></span>[1](#fn_57.md)

Buddhism received no check from the Sui emperors, who ruled China for
the short period of thirty-seven years. The first of them, on assuming
the title of emperor in 581, issued an edict giving full toleration to
this sect. Towards the close of his reign he prohibited the destruction
or maltreatment of any of the images of the Buddhist or Tauist sects. It
was the weakness of age, says the Confucian historian, giving way to
superstitions that led him to such an act as this. The same commentator
on the history of the period says, that the Buddhist books were at this
time ten times more numerous than the Confucian

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

classics. The *Sui History* in the digest it gives of all the books of
the time, states those of the Buddhist sect to be 1950 distinct works.
Many of the titles are given, and among them are not a few treating of
the mode of writing by alphabetic symbols used in the kingdoms from
whence Buddhism came. The first alphabet that was thus introduced
appears to have been one of fourteen symbols. It is called *Si-yo
hu-shu* or "Foreign Writing of the Western countries," and also
*Ba-la-men-shu*, "Brahmanical writing." The tables of initials and
finals found in the Chinese native dictionaries were first formed in the
third century, but more fully early in the sixth century, in the Liang
dynasty. It was then that the Hindoos, who had come to China, assisted
in forming, according to the model of the Sanscrit alphabet, a system of
thirty-six initial letters, and described the vocal organs by which they
are formed. They also constructed tables, in which, by means of two sets
of representative characters, one for the initials and another for the
finals, a mode of spelling words was exhibited. The Chinese were now
taught for the first time that monosyllabic sounds are divisible into
parts, but alphabetic symbols were not adopted to write the separated
elements. It was thought better to use characters already known to the
people. A serious defect attended this method. The analysis was not
carried far enough. Intelligent Chinese understand that a sound, such as
man, can be divided into two parts, m and an; for they have been long
accustomed to the system of phonetic bisection here alluded to, but they
usually refuse to believe that a trisection of the sound is practicable.
At the same time the system was much easier to learn than if foreign
symbols had been employed, and it was very soon universally adopted.
Shen-kung, a priest, is said to have been the author of the system, and
the dictionary *Yü-p’ien* was one of the first extensive works in which
it was employed. <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md) That the Hindoo
Buddhists should have taught the Chinese

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

how to write the sounds of this language by an artifice which required
nothing but their own hieroglyphics, and rendered unnecessary the
introduction of new symbols, is sufficient evidence of their ingenuity,
and is not the least of the services they have done to the sons of Han.
It answered well for several centuries, and was made use of in all
dictionaries and educational works. But the language changed, the old
sounds were broken up, and now the words thus spelt are read correctly
only by those natives who happen to speak the dialects that most nearly
resemble in sound the old pronunciation.

To Shen Yo, the historian of two dynasties, and author of several
detached historical pieces, is attributed the discovery of the four
tones. His biographer says of him in the "Liang History:"—"He wrote his
'Treatise on the Four Tones,' to make known what men for thousands of
years had not understood—the wonderful fact which he alone in the
silence of his breast came to perceive." It may be well doubted if the
credit of arriving unassisted at the knowledge of this fact is due to
him. He resided at the court of Liang Wu-ti, the great patron of the
Indian strangers. They, accustomed to the unrivalled accuracy in
phonetic analysis of the Sanscrit alphabet, would readily distinguish a
new phenomenon like this, while to a native speaker, who had never known
articulate sounds to be without it, it would almost necessarily be
undetected. In the syllabic spelling that they formed, the tones are
duly represented, by being embraced in every instance in the final.

The extent of influence which this nomenclature for sounds has attained
in the native literature is known to all who are familiar with its
dictionaries, and the common editions of the classical books. In this
way it is that the traditions of old sounds needed to explain the rhymes
and metre of the ancient national poetry are preserved. By the same
method the sounds of modern dialects that have deviated extensively from
the old type have been committed

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

to writing. The dialects of the Mandarin provinces, of Northern and
Southern Fu-kien, and Canton have been written down by native authors
each with its one system of tones and alphabetic elements, and they have
all taken the method introduced by the Buddhists as their guide. The
Chinese have since become acquainted with several alphabets with foreign
symbols, but when they need to write phonetically they prefer the
system, imperfect as it is, that does not oblige them to abandon the
hieroglyphic signs transmitted by their ancestors. Never, perhaps, since
the days of Cadmus, was a philological impulse more successful than that
thus communicated from India to the Chinese, if the extent of its
adoption be the criterion. They have not only by the use of the syllabic
spelling thus taught them, collected the materials for philological
research afforded by the modern dialects, but, by patient industry, have
discovered the early history of the language, showing how the number of
tones increased from two to three by the time of Confucius, to four in
the sixth century of our era, and so on to their present state. Few
foreign investigators have yet entered on this field of research, but it
may be suggested that the philology of the Eastern languages must
without it be necessarily incomplete, and that the Chinese, by patience
and a true scientific instinct, have placed the materials in such a form
that little labour is needed to gather from them the facts that they
contain.

The Thibetans, and, probably, the Coreans also, owe their alphabets,
which are both arranged in the Sanscrit mode, to the Buddhists. Corean
ambassadors came in the reign of Liang Wu-ti to ask for the "Nirvâna"
and other Buddhistic classics. It may then have been as early as this
that they had an alphabet, but the writing now in use dates from about
A.D. 1360, as Mr. Scott has shown. <span id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59.md)

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

The first emperor of the T‘ang dynasty was induced by the
representations of Fu Yi, one of his ministers, to call a council for
deliberation on the mode of action to be adopted in regard to Buddhism.
Fu Yi, a stern enemy of the new religion, proposed that the monks and
nuns should be compelled to marry and bring up families. The reason that
they adopted the ascetic life, he said, was to avoid contributing to the
revenue. What they held about the fate of mankind depending on the will
of Buddha was false. Life and death were regulated by a "natural
necessity" with which man had nothing to do (*yeu-ü-tsï-jan*). The
retribution of vice and virtue was the province of the prince, while
riches and poverty were the recompense provoked by our own actions. The
public manners had degenerated lamentably through the influence of
Buddhism. The "six states of being" <span id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_60.md)
into which the souls of men might be born were entirely fictitious. The
monks lived an idle life, and were unprofitable members of the
commonwealth. To this it was replied in the council, by Siau Ü, a friend
of the Buddhists, that Buddha was a "sage" (*shing-jen*), and that Fu Yi
having spoken ill of a sage, was guilty of a great crime. To this Fu Yi
answered, that the highest of the virtues were loyalty and filial piety,
and the monks, casting off as they did their prince and their parents,
disregarded them both. As for Siau Ü, he added, he was—being the
advocate of such a system—as destitute as they

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

of these virtues. Siau Ü joined his hands and merely replied to him,
that hell was made for such men as he. The Confucianists gained the
victory, and severe restrictions were imposed on the professors of the
foreign faith, but they were taken off almost immediately after.

The successors of Bodhidharma were five in number. They are styled with
him the six "Eastern patriarchs," *Tung-tsu*. They led quiet lives. The
fourth of them was invited to court by the second emperor of the T‘ang
dynasty, and repeatedly declined the honour. When a messenger came for
the fourth time and informed him that, if he refused to go, he had
orders to take his head back with him, the imperturbable old man merely
held out his neck to the sword in token of his willingness to die. The
emperor respected his firmness. Some years previously, with a large
number of disciples, he had gone to a city in Shansi. The city was soon
after laid siege to by rebels. The patriarch advised his followers to
recite the "Great Prajna," *Ma-ha-pat-nia*, an extensive work, in which
the most abstract dogmas of Buddhist philosophy are very fully
developed. The enemy, looking towards the ramparts, thought they saw a
band of spirit-soldiers in array against them, and consequently retired.

In the year 629 the celebrated Hiuen-tsang set out on his journey to
India to procure Sanscrit books. Passing from Liang-cheu at the
north-western extremity of China, he proceeded westward to the region
watered by the Oxus and Jaxartes where the Turks <span
id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_61.md) were then settled. He

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

afterwards crossed the Hindoo-kush and proceeded into India. He lingered
for a long time in the countries through which the Ganges flows, rich as
they were in reminiscences and relics of primitive Buddhism. Then
bending his steps to the southwards, he completed the tour of the Indian
peninsula, returned across the Indus, and reached home in the sixteenth
year after his departure. The same emperor, T‘ai-tsung, was still
reigning, and he received the traveller with the utmost distinction. He
spent the rest of his days in translating from the Sanscrit originals
the Buddhist works he had brought with him from India. It was by
imperial command that these translations were undertaken. The same
emperor, T‘ai-tsung, received with equal favour the Syrian Christians,
Alopen and his companions, who had arrived in A.D. 639, only seven years
before Hiuen-tsang's return. The *Histoire de la Vie de Hiouen-thsang*,
translated by M. Julien, is a volume full of interest for the history of
Buddhism and

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Buddhist
literature. As a preparation for the task, the accomplished translator
added to his unrivalled knowledge of the Chinese language an extensive
acquaintance with Sanscrit, acquired when he was already advanced in
life, with this special object. Scarcely does the name of a place or a
book occur in the narrative which he has not identified and given to the
reader in its Sanscrit form. The book was originally written by two
friends of Hiuen-tsang. It includes a specimen of Sanscrit grammar,
exemplifying the declensions of nouns, with their eight cases and three
numbers, the conjugation of the substantive verb, and other details.
Hiuen-tsang remained five years in the monastery of Nalanda, on the
banks of the Ganges, studying the language, and reading the Brahmanical
literature as well as that of Buddhism.

Hiuen-tsang was summoned on his arrival to appear at court, and answer
for his conduct, in leaving his country and undertaking so long a
journey without the imperial permission. The emperor—praised by Gibbon
as the Augustus of the East—was residing at Lo-yang, to which city the
traveller proceeded. He had brought with him 115 grains of relics taken
from Buddha's chair; a gold statue of Buddha, 3 feet 3 inches in height,
with a transparent pedestal; a second, 3 feet 5 inches in height, and
others of silver and carved in sandal-wood. His collection of Sanscrit
books was very extensive. A sufficient conception of the voluminous
contributions then made to Chinese literature from India will be
obtained by enumerating some of the names.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> These works,
amounting with others to 657, were carried by twenty-two horses.

The emperor, after listening to the traveller's account of what he had
seen, commanded him to write a description of the Western countries, and
the work called *Ta-t‘ang-si-yü-ki* was the result. <span
id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62.md)

Hiuen-tsang went to *Ch‘ang-an* (Si-an-fu) to translate, and was
assisted by twelve monks. Nine others were appointed to revise the
composition. Some who had learned Sanscrit also joined him in the work.
On presenting a series of translations to the emperor, he wrote a
preface to them; and at the request of Hiuen-tsang issued an edict that
five new monks should be received in every convent in the empire. The
convents then amounted to 3716. The losses of Buddhism from the
persecutions to which it had been exposed were thus repaired.

At the emperor's instance, Hiuen-tsang now corrected the translation of
the celebrated Sutra *Kin-kang-pat-nia-pa-la-mi-ta-king* (in Sanscrit,
*Vajra-chedika-prajna-para-mita Sutra*). Two words were added to the
title which Kumarajiva had omitted. The new title read *Neng-twan-kin*,
*etc*. The name of the city Shravasti was spelt with five characters
instead of two. The new translation of this work did not supplant the
old one—that of Kumarajiva. The latter is at the present day the most
common, except the "Daily Prayers," of all books in the Buddhist temples
and monasteries, and is in the hands of almost every monk.

This work contains the germ of the larger compilation *Prajna paramita*
in one hundred and twenty volumes. The abstractions of Buddhist
philosophy, which were afterwards ramified to such a formidable extent
as these numbers indicate, are here found in their primary form
probably, as they were taught by Shakyamuni himself. The translation of
the larger work was not completed till A.D.

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 661. That
Hiuen-tsang, as a translator, was a strong literalist, may be inferred
from the fact, that when he was meditating on the propriety of imitating
Kumarajiva, who omitted repetitions and superfluities, in so large a
work as this, he was deterred by a dream from the idea, and resolved to
give the one hundred and twenty volumes entire, in all their wearisome
reiteration of metaphysical paradoxes.

Among the new orthographies that he introduced was that of *Bi-ch‘u* for
*Bi-k‘u*, "Mendicant disciple," and of *Ba-ga-vam* instead of *But* for
"Buddha." This spelling nearly coincides with that of the Nepaulese
Sanscrit, *Bhagavat*. In the Pali versions he is called "Gautama," which
is a patronymic, in Chinese, *Go-dam*. *Ba-ga-vam* is used in the Sutra
*Yo-sï-lieu-li-kwang-ju-lai-kung-te-king*. Modern reprints of
Hiuen-tsang's translation of the Shastras called *Abhidharma*, are found
in a fragmentary and worm-eaten state in many of the larger Buddhist
temples near Shanghai and elsewhere at the present time. He lived
nineteen years after his return, and spent nearly the whole of that time
in translating. He completed 740 works, in 1335 books. Among them were
three works on Logic, viz., *Li-men-lun*, *In-ming-lun*,
*In-ming-shu-kiai*. Among other works that he brought to China, were
treatises on Grammar, *Shing-ming-lun* and *Pe-ye-kie-la-nan*, and a
Lexicon, *Abhidharma Kosha*. <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md)

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

The modern Chinese editor of the "Description of Western Countries"
complains of its author's superstition. Anxiety to detail every Buddhist
wonder has been accompanied by neglect of the physical features of the
countries that came under review. Here, says the critic, he cannot be
compared with *Ngai Ju-lio* (Julius Aleni, one of the early Jesuits) in
the *Chih-fang-wai-ki* (a well-known geographical work by that
missionary). In truthfulness this work is not equal, he tells us, to the
"Account of Buddhist kingdoms" by Fa-hien, but it is written in a style
much more ornamental. The extensive knowledge, he adds, of Buddhist
literature possessed by Hiuen - tsang himself, and the elegant style of
his assistants, make the book interesting, so that, though it contains
not a little that is false, the reader does not go to sleep over it.

The life and adventures of Hiuen-tsang have been made the basis of a
long novel, which is universally read at the present time. It is called
the *Si-yeu-ki* or *Si-yeu-chen-ts‘euen*. The writer, apparently a
Tauist, makes unlimited use of the two mythologies—that of his own
religion and that of his hero—as the machinery of his tale. He has
invented a most eventful account of the birth of Hiuen-tsang. It might
have been supposed that the wild romance of India was unsuited to the
Chinese taste, but our author does not hesitate to adopt it. His readers
become familiar with all those imaginary deities, whose figures they see
in the Buddhist temples, as the ornaments of a fictitious narrative. The
hero, in undertaking so distant and dangerous a journey to obtain the
sacred

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

books of Buddhism, and by translating them into his native tongue, to
promote the spread of that superstition among his countrymen, is
represented as the highest possible example of the excellence at which
the Buddhist aims. The effort and the success that crowns it, are
identified with the aspiration of the Tauist after the elixir of
immortality; the hermit's elevation to the state of Buddha, and the
translation of those whose hearts have been purified by meditation and
retirement, to the abodes of the genii.

The sixth emperor of the T‘ang dynasty was too weak to rule. Wu, the
emperor's mother, held the reins of power, and distinguished herself by
her ability and by her cruelties.

In the year 690 a new Buddhist Sutra, the *Ta-yün-king*, "Great cloud
Sutra," was presented to her. It stated that she was Maitreya, the
Buddha that was to come, and the ruler of the Jambu continent. She
ordered it to be circulated through the empire, and bestowed public
offices on more than one Buddhist priest.

Early in the eighth century, the Confucianists made another effort to
bring about a persecution of Buddhism. In 714, Yen Ts’ung argued that it
was pernicious to the state, and appealed for proof to the early
termination of those dynasties that had favoured it. In carrying out an
edict then issued, more than 12,000 priests and nuns were obliged to
return to the common world. Casting images, writing the sacred books,
and building temples, were also forbidden.

At this time some priests are mentioned as holding public offices in the
government. The historians animadvert on this circumstance, as one of
the monstrosities accompanying a female reign.

About the beginning of the same century, Hindoos were employed to
regulate the national calendar. The first mentioned is Gaudamara, whose
method of calculation was called *Kwang-tse-li*, "The calendar of the
bright house." It was used fur three years only. A better-known Buddhist

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

astronomer of the same nation was Gaudamsiddha. By imperial command he
translated from Sanscrit, the mode of astronomical calculation called
*Kien-chï-shu*. It embraced the calculation of the moon's course and of
eclipses. His calendar of this name was adopted for a few years, when it
was followed in A.D. 721 by that of the well-known Yih-hing, a Chinese
Buddhist priest, whose name holds a place in the first rank of the
native astronomers. The translations of Gaudamsiddha are contained in
the work called *K‘ai-yuen-chan-king*, a copy of which was discovered
accidentally, in the latter part of the sixteenth century, inside an
image of Buddha. It has been cut in wood more than once since that time.
The part translated from Sanscrit is but a small portion of the work.
The remainder is chiefly astrological. Among other things, there is a
short notice of the Indian arithmetical notation, with its nine symbols
and a dot for a cipher. There was nothing new in this to the countrymen
of Confucius, so far as the principle of decimal notation was concerned;
but it is interesting to us, whose ancestors did not obtain the Indian
numerals till several centuries after this time. The Arabs learned them
in the eighth century, and transmitted them slowly to Europe. Among the
earlier Buddhist translations, a book is mentioned under the title of
Brahmanical Astronomy," *P‘o-lo-men-t‘ien-wen*, in twenty chapters. It
was translated in the sixth century by Daluchi, a native of the Maleya
kingdom. Another is *Ba-la-men-gih-ga-sien-jen-t‘ien-wen-shwo*, "An
Account of Astronomy by the Brahman Gigarishi." <span
id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64.md)

The date of these translations, mentioned in the "History of the Sui
dynasty," can be no later than the sixth century or very early in the
seventh. The same should be observed of two works on Brahmanical
arithmetic, viz., *Ba-la-men-swan-fa* and Ba-la-men-swan-king, each
containing three chapters, and a third on the calculation of the
calendar,

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
*Ba-la-men-yin-yang-swan-li*, in one chapter. All these works, with one
or two others given by the same authority, are now hopelessly lost, but
the names as they stand in the history unattended by a word of comment,
are an irrefragable testimony to the efforts made by the Hindoo
Buddhists to diffuse the science and civilisation of their native land.
The native mathematicians of the time may have obtained assistance from
these sources, or from the numerous Indians who lived in China in the
T‘ang dynasty. In the extant arithmetical books composed before the date
of these works, examples of calculation are written perpendicularly,
like any other writing, but in all later mathematical works they are
presented to the eye as we ourselves write them from left to right. The
principle by which figures are thus arranged as multiples of ten
changing their value with their position, was known to the Chinese from
the most ancient times. Their early mode of calculating by counters,
imitated more recently in the common commercial abacus, was based on
this principle. <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65.md) But it does not
appear that they employed it to express arithmetical processes in
writing before the Hindoos began to translate mathematical treatises
into the language.

The next notice of Buddhism in the history is after several decades of
years. The emperor Su-tsung, in A.D. 760, showed his attachment for
Buddhism by appointing a ceremonial for his birthday, according to the
ritual of that religion. The service was performed in the palace, the
inmates of which were made to personate the Buddhas and Bodhisattwas,
while the courtiers worshipped round them in a ring.

The successor of this emperor, T‘ai-tsung, was still more devoted to the
superstitions of Buddhism, and was seconded by his chief minister of
state and the general of his army. A high stage for reciting the
classics was erected by imperial command, and the "Sutra of the
Benevolent King," *Jen-wang-king*, chanted there and explained by the
priests.

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This book was
brought in a state carriage, with the same parade of attendant nobles
and finery as in the case of the emperor leaving his palace. Two public
buildings were ordered to be taken down to assist in the erection and
decoration of a temple built by Yü Chau-shï, the general, and named
Chang-king-sï. A remonstrance, prepared on the occasion by a Confucian
mandarin, stated that the wise princes of antiquity secured prosperity
by their good conduct—not by prayers and offerings. The imperial ear was
deaf to such arguments. The reasoning of those who maintained that
misfortune could be averted and happiness obtained by prayer was
listened to with much more readiness. Tae-tsung maintained many monks,
and believed that by propitiating the unseen powers who regulate the
destinies of mankind, he could preserve his empire from danger at a less
cost than that of the blood and treasure wasted on the battle-field.
When his territory was invaded, he set his priests to chant their
masses, and the barbarians retired. The Confucianist commentary in
condemning the confidence thus placed in the prayers of the priests,
remarks that to procure happiness or prevent misery after death, by
prayers or any other means, is out of our power, and that the same is
true of the present life. One of those who had great influence over the
emperor was a Singhalese priest named "Amogha," *Pu-k‘ung*, <span
id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_66.md) "Not empty," who held a high government
office, and was honoured with the first title of the ancient Chinese
nobility. Monasteries and monks now multiplied fast under the imperial
favour. In the year 768, at the full moon of the seventh month, an
offering bowl for feeding hungry ghosts was brought in state by the
emperor's command from the palace, and presented to the Chang-king-sï
temple. This is an allusion to a superstition still practised in the
large Buddhist monasteries. Those who have been so unhappy

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

as to be born into the class of *ngo-kwei*, or "hungry spirits," at the
full moon of the seventh month, have their annual repast. The priests
assemble, recite prayers for their benefit, and throw out rice to the
four quarters of the world, as food for them. The ceremony is called
*Yü-lan-hwei* (*ulam*), "the assembly for saving those who have been
overturned." It is said to have been instituted by Shakyamuni, who
directed Moginlin, one of his disciples, to make offerings for the
benefit of his mother, she having become a *ngo-kwei*.

The emperor Hien-tsung, A.D. 819, sent mandarins to escort a bone of
Buddha to the capital. He had been told that it was opened to view once
in thirty years, and when this happened it was sure to be a peaceful and
prosperous year. It was at Fung-siang fu, in Shen-si, and was to be
reopened the next year, which would afford a good opportunity for
bringing it to the palace. It was brought accordingly, and the
mandarins, court ladies, and common people vied with each other in their
admiration of the relic. All their fear was, lest they should not get a
sight of it, or be too late in making their offerings.

On this occasion Han Yü, or Han Wen-kung, presented a strongly-worded
remonstrance to the emperor, entitled *Fo-ku-piau*, "Memorial on the
bone of Buddha." He was consequently degraded from his post as
vice-president of the Board of punishments, and appointed to be prefect
of Chau-cheu, in the province of Canton. A heavier punishment would have
been awarded him, had not the courtiers represented the propriety of
allowing liberty of speech, and succeeded in mitigating the imperial
anger.

In this memorial he appealed first to antiquity, arguing that the empire
was more prosperous and men's lives were longer before Buddhism was
introduced than after. After the Han dynasty, when the Indian priests
arrived, the dynasties all became perceptibly shorter in duration, and
although Liang Wu-ti was on the throne thirty-eight years, he died, as
was well known, from starvation, in a

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

monastery to which he had retired for the third time. <span
id="fr_67"></span>[1](#fn_67.md) The writer then pleads to Hien-tsung the
example of his predecessor, the first Tang emperor, and the hope that he
himself had awakened in the minds of the literati by his former
restrictions on Buddhism, that he would tread in his steps. He had now
commanded Buddha's bone to be escorted to the palace. This could not be
because he himself was ensnared into the belief of Buddhism. It was only
to gain the hearts of the people by professed reverence for that
superstition. None who were wise and enlightened believed in any such
thing. It was a foreign religion. The dress of the priests, the language
of the books, the moral code, were all different from those of China.
Why should a decayed bone, the filthy remains of a man who died so long
before, be introduced to the imperial residence? He concluded by braving
the vengeance of Buddha. If he had any power and could inflict any
punishment, he was ready to bear it himself to its utmost extent. This
memorial has ever since been a standard quotation with the
Confucianists, when wishing to expose the pernicious effects of
Buddhism. The boldness of its censures on the emperor's superstition,
and the character of the writer as one who excelled in beauty of style,
have secured it lasting popularity. Among the crowd of good authors
whose names adorn the T‘ang dynasty, Han Wen-kung stands first of those
who devoted themselves to prose composition. Christian natives in
preaching to their countrymen often allude to this document.

Extraordinary superstition provoked extraordinary resistance. The
sovereigns of the T‘ang dynasty were so fond of Buddhism that it has
passed into a proverb. <span id="fr_68"></span>[2](#fn_68.md)

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

In the year 845 a third and very severe persecution befell the
Buddhists. By an edict of the emperor Wu-tsung, 4600 monasteries were
destroyed, with 40,000 smaller edifices. The property of the sect was
confiscated, and used in the erection of buildings for the use of
government functionaries. The copper of images and bells was devoted to
casting cash. More than 260,000 priests and nuns were compelled to
return to common employments. The monks of Wu-t‘ai, in Shan-si, near
T'ai-yuen fu, fled to "Yen-cheu" (now Peking), in Pe-chi-li, where they
were at first taken under the protection of the officer ill charge, but
afterwards abandoned to the imperial indignation.

At this place there was a collection of five monasteries, constituting
together the richest Buddhist establishment in the empire. There is a
legend connected with this spot, which says that Manjusiri, one of the
most celebrated of the secondary divinities of Buddhism, has frequently
appeared in this mountain retreat, especially as an old man. By the
Northern Buddhists "Manjusiri," *Wen-shu-shï-li* (in old Chinese,
Men-ju-si-li), is scarcely less honoured than the equally fabulous
Bodhisattwa, Kwan-shï-yin. The chief seat of his worship in China is the
locality in Shan-si just alluded to, where he is regarded like P‘u-hien
in Sï-ch‘wen and Kwan-yin at P‘u-to the Buddhist sacred island, as the
tutelary deity of the region. Wen-shu p‘u-sa, as he is called, differs
from his fellow Bodhisattwas in being spoken of in some Sutras as if he
were an historical character. On this there hangs some doubt. His image
is a common one in the temples of the sect.

The emperor Wu-tsung died a few months afterwards. Siuen-tsung, who
followed him, commenced his reign by reversing the policy of his
predecessor in reference to Buddhism. Eight monasteries were reared in
the metropolis, and the people were again permitted to take the vows of
celibacy and retirement from the world. Soon afterwards the edifices of
idolatry that had been given

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

over to destruction were commanded to be restored. The Confucian
historian expresses a not very amiable regret at the shortness of the
persecution. Those of the Wei and Cheu emperors had been continued for
six and seven years, while in this case it was only for a year or two
that the profession of Buddhism was made a public crime.

A memorial was presented to the emperor a few years after by Sun Tsiau,
complaining that the support of the Buddhist monks was an intolerable
burden on the people, and praying that the admission of new persons
might be prohibited. The prayer was granted.

The line of the patriarchs had terminated a little before the period
which this narrative has now reached, and the most influential leader of
the Chinese Buddhists was Matsu, who belonged to the order of
*Ch‘an-shï*, <span id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69.md) one of the three
divisions of Buddhist monks. As such, he followed the system taught by
Bodhidharma, which consisted in abstraction of the mind from all objects
of sense, and even its own thoughts. He addressed his disciples in the
following words, "You all believe that the 'mind' (*sin*) itself is
'Buddha' (intelligence). Bodhidharma came to

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> China, and taught
the method of the heart, that you might be enlightened. He brought the
*Lenga Sutra*, exhibiting the true impression of the human mind as it
really is, that you might not allow it to become disordered. Therefore
that book has but one subject, the instructions of Buddha concerning the
mind. The true method is to have no method. Out of the mind there is no
Buddha. Out of Buddha there is no mind. Virtue is not to be sought, nor
vice to be shunned. Nothing should be looked upon as pure or polluted.
To have a sensation of an object is nothing but to become conscious of
the mind's own activity. The mind does not know itself, because it is
blinded by the sensations." He was asked, by what means excellence in
religion should be attained? He replied, "Religion does not consist in
the use of means. To use means is fatal to the attainment of the
object." Then what, he was again asked, is required to be done in order
to religious advancement? "Human nature in itself," he said, "is
sufficient for its own wants. All that is needed is to avoid both vice
and virtue. He that can do this is a 'religious man' (*sieu-tau-jen*)."

These extracts indicate that a great change had taken place in the
popular teaching of Buddhism. In the first centuries of its history in
China, retribution and the future life were most insisted on. But the
tenets of Bodhidharma, who aimed to restore what he considered the true
doctrine of Buddha, gradually diffused themselves and became the most
powerful element in the system. The consequence was a less strong faith
in the future life.

I-tsung, who ascended the throne A.D. 860, was devoted to the study of
the Buddhist books. Priests were called in to discourse on their
religion in the private apartments of his palace, and the monasteries
were frequently honoured with the imperial presence. He was memorialised
in vain by the Confucian mandarins, who represented that Tauism,
speaking as it did of mercy and moderation, and the original religion of
China, of which the fundamental principles

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

were benevolence and rectitude, were enough for China, and the emperor
should follow no other. This emperor practised writing in Sanscrit
characters, and chanted the classics in the originals according to the
musical laws of the land from which they came. Nothing could be more
irritating to rigid conservatives, who hated everything foreign and
lived to glorify Confucius, than to hear such sounds issuing from the
imperial apartments. In this reign another bone of Buddha was brought to
the palace. When it arrived the emperor went out to meet it, and
prostrated himself on the ground before it, weeping while he uttered the
"invocation of worship" (*namo*). The ceremonies were on a scale even
greater than at the annual sacrifice to Heaven and Earth. Similar scenes
occurred at about the same time in the West, when European kings were
not ashamed to honour the relics of Christian romance, just as their
contemporaries in the far East revered those of the equally luxuriant
imagination of Buddhism. No one in the West, however, raised so loud a
voice of warning against these superstitions as the Confucian mandarins
at the court of Ch‘ang-an.

Among the foreign Buddhists who took up their residence in China in the
first T‘ang dynasty was Bodhiruchi. He translated the *Hwa-yen* and
*Pau-tsih* Sutras. Lenga, a second, came from the north of the
Ts’ung-ling mountains; others from India. The usual story of these
wanderers was that they were the sons of kings, and had resigned their
title to the crown to free themselves from worldly cares, and cultivate
the heart. These tales may have been true, but they should not be
repeated too often, for fear of exciting suspicion in the mind of the
reader. More than one of these *ci-devant* princes adopted the
profession of rainmaker at the Chinese court, and saved the country from
drought for a considerable period. On one occasion the emperor was
assured that it would rain when certain images opened their eyes. After
three days the images showed the same willingness to gratify the
expectation of

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

their worshippers as have those of another religion, and the prophecy
was fulfilled.

Pu-k‘ung, already mentioned, came from Ceylon. <span
id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_70.md) As he was travelling, a herd of elephants
rushed towards him. He sat quietly on the way side. The elephants all
knelt down before him and retired. When he came to China, he produced,
it is said, a great reformation of manners in court and country, and was
reverenced as a divinity. If judged by his works, <span
id="fr_71"></span>[2](#fn_71.md) however, consisting of unintelligible
charms with pictures of many Bodhisattwas, he brought a grosser
superstition than before. His book of directions for calling hungry
spirits to be fed, by magical arrangements of the fingers, delineations
of Sanscrit characters and such like means, vindicates for him the
unenviable honour of being the chief promoter of Buddhist fetishism in
China. From Sin-la, a kingdom now forming part of Corea, some priests
also came. One of these, named Wu-leu, was retained by the emperor
Hiuen-tsung, with Pu-k‘ung, to pray for the imperial and national
prosperity. When he approached his end he rose in the air a foot high,
and so died. <span id="fr_72"></span>[3](#fn_72.md)

At this time some priests came from Japan, bringing ten of the monastic
dresses denominated *Sanghali*, as presents to those in China who should
best deserve them. Lan-chin praised the gift as evidence of the
advancement made by the donors in the knowledge and dispositions of the
true Buddhist. He determined to go to Japan, and

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

after a tempestuous voyage he arrived there. The king came out to meet
him, and assigned him a residence. From him the Japanese received their
first instructions in the Discipline of Buddhism, or the rules of the
monastic life.

Under the Later T‘ang dynasty a native priest of Wu-t‘ai, observing the
mode in which the foreign Buddhists obtained their influence, felt a
wish to share with them in the dominion of the atmosphere. He gave out
that the dragon of the sky was obedient to him, and that wind and rain
came at his call. The emperor and empress prostrated themselves before
him, and he did not think it necessary to rise in their presence.
Unfortunately a long drought arrived, and his prayers were unavailing to
bring it to a termination. Enraged at his want of success, some proposed
to burn him, but he was permitted to return home, and died of
disappointment.

The last emperor of this short dynasty was much under the influence of
Ajeli, a foreigner at Fung-siang, in Shen-si. He was memorialised by an
officer of his court, on the subject of instituting examinations for
those who wished to adopt the Buddhist life of reading and retirement.
The monks and nuns should both be examined in the "Shastras" (*Lun*),
the "Sutras" (*King*), and the daily duties of the monastery. In the
same way he recommended that those who aspired to become Tauist priests
should be examined in the literature of that sect. The emperor assented
to these propositions. His successor of the Later Tsin dynasty
distributed favours and titles very freely among the professors of the
two faiths, and, as was natural, foreign priests, with teeth and other
relics of Buddha, continued to arrive.

A little later a prince of the Cheu family and the immediate predecessor
of the founder of the Sung dynasty, placed severe restrictions on
Buddhism, and prohibited all temples except those that had received an
inscribed tablet from former emperors. More than thirty thousand of
these

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

buildings were in consequence suppressed by edict; 2694 temples were
retained. The same edict prohibited the monks and lay Buddhists from
cutting off their hands and feet, burning their fingers, suspending
lighted lamps by hooks inserted into the flesh, and from carrying
pincers in a similar manner. "Let us not smile," says Mr. Watters, "at
these self-imposed tortures, unless we can also weep to think that
similar tortures have been practised by the followers of Jesus—not only
by individuals on their own bodies, but also upon those of their
fellows."

T‘ai-tsu, the first emperor of the Sung family (A.D. 964), sent
messengers to persuade his contemporary of the house of T‘ang not to
show such devotion to Buddhist superstitions as he had done. The latter
took the remonstrance in good part, and ceased to look with his former
regard on the crowd of priests that frequented his capital. T‘ai-tsung,
the second in the new succession, stopped the public examinations of
candidates for monk's orders. He was an enemy to the delusions which he
saw to be so popular among his subjects. Hearing that wood was being
collected to form a death pyre for a priest who had determined to burn
himself, he thought it was time to act, and issued an edict forbidding
new temples. He changed his policy a few years after; for the history of
the time relates the erection by his command of a pagoda 360 Chinese
feet in height. It was completed in eight years, and relics of Buddha
were deposited in it. A short notice of this class of structures will be
here introduced.

The number of pagodas in China is very great. There are nine within
thirty miles of Shanghai. When complete and well situated, the pagoda is
without dispute the most ornamental edifice to be seen in this Eastern
world. Perhaps no more beautiful single object could be added by the
hand of man to hill and wood scenery. At Lo-yang, in the Tsin dynasty
(A.D. 350), there were forty-two, from three to nine stories high,
richly painted, and formed after Indian models. The word *t‘a* (formerly
*t‘ap*), now in universal

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

use, has displaced the older names *feu-t‘u* (*budu*) and *fo-t‘u*
(*buddu*). The original purpose of the edifice was to deposit relics of
Buddha. These relics might be a hair, tooth, metamorphosed piece of
bone, article of dress, or rice vessel. When the bodies of deceased
Bodhisattwas and other revered persons were burnt, the remains were
placed in structures which received the same name, *t‘upa* or *st‘upa*,
and it is these that have been described by travellers, in Afghanistan
and other regions where Buddhism formerly prevailed, as topes.

"When there is no 'relic'" (*she-li;* in Sanscrit, *sharira*), says the
cyclopædia *Fa-yuen-chu-lin*, "the building is called *chi-ti*" (in
Sanscrit, *chaitya*), and it may be intended to commemorate the
birthplace of Buddha, the spot where he became enlightened, where he
taught, or where he entered into the Nirvâna. Footsteps of Buddha, an
image of a Bodhisattwa or of a Pratyeka Buddha, are also honoured with
the erection of a *chi-ti*.

When pagodas are without relics and unconnected with any legend, their
erection must be attributed to reasons founded on the Chinese "geomancy"
(*feng-shui*). These buildings are supposed to have a very important and
happy influence on the districts in which they are situated. The charity
of the contributors is also believed to be repaid in riches, longevity,
and forgiveness of sins, as in the case of all Chinese almsgiving.

Most of the existing pagodas date from the time at which our narrative
has now arrived. Those built in the T‘ang and previous dynasties have
many of then fallen a prey to the ruinous hand of time; while more
recently the diminished favour which those possessing wealth and power
have extended to Buddhism has caused an entire cessation of pagoda
building, except when old ones were to be restored.

In the tenth century, <span id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_73.md) the royal
family of the Min kingdom, bearing the surname Wang, were very much
devoted

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

to Buddhism. To them the city of Foochow owes the two pagodas which
adorn it. The king admitted ten thousand persons to the vows in A.D.
940.

Anything that is precious in the eyes of the Buddhist devotee may be
deposited in these structures. One was erected by the emperor for the
preservation of the newly-arrived Sanscrit books at the request of
Hiuen-tsang, lest they should be injured for want of care. It was 180
feet high, had five stories with grains of *she-li* (relics) in the
centre of each, and contained monuments inscribed with the prefaces
written by the emperor and prince royal to Hiuen-tsang's translations.

The great expense of large Buddhist structures sometimes led the more
self-confident of the priests to rash resolutions. On one occasion a
monk of T‘ien-t‘ai, a large and ancient establishment to the south of
Ningpo, professed to the emperor his wish to commit himself to the
flames when the erection of a certain temple was completed. His desire
was granted, and an officer sent to see that the temple was built and
the feat carried into execution. The pile was made and the priest called
on to come forward. He excused himself, but in vain. He looked round on
the assembled crowd for some one to save him; among priests and people,
however, none offered to help the trembling victim of his own folly. The
stern voice of the imperial messenger bade him ascend the pile. He still
lingered, and was at length seized by the attendants, placed forcibly on
the pile and burnt.

The conduct of the emperors towards Buddhism was then, as it has been
more recently, very inconsistent. Favour was shown to priests, while
occasional edicts were issued intended to check the progress of the
system. The emperors gratified their private feelings by gorgeous
erections for the practice of idolatry, while they paid a tribute to the
Confucian prejudices of the literati by denouncing the religion in
public proclamations.

In the reign of Chen-tsung, a favourer of Buddhism, a

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

priest from India is mentioned as translating the "Sutra of Good
Fortune," *Fo-ki-siang-king*, and other works, to the number of more
than two hundred chapters.

Jen-tsung, in A.D. 1035, made an effort to preserve the knowledge of
Sanscrit literature by appointing fifty youths to study it. A few years
earlier, it is said in a notice of Fa-t‘ien-pen, a native of "Magadha"
(Bahar), in India, that he was assisted in translating the
*Wu-liang-sheu-king*, the "Sutra of Boundless Age," and other works, by
a native of China familiar with Sanscrit. These facts have a bearing on
the possible existence of Sanscrit manuscripts in China. One old
manuscript only has yet been discovered, in South China, in that mode of
writing. Occasionally a few specimen characters are introduced in native
works where foreign alphabets are treated of. <span
id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_74.md) In an account of the Kwo-ts‘ing monastery
in the "History of T‘ien-t‘ai-shan" it is said that a single work was
saved from a fire there several centuries ago, which was written on the
*pei-to* (patra), or "palm" leaf of India. A visit to T‘ien-t‘ai—a spot
abounding in Buddhist antiquities, the earliest, and except P‘u-to, the
largest and richest seat of that religion in Eastern China—by myself and
two companions led to the discovery that this work is still there, but
in the Kau-ming monastery, and that it is written in the Sanscrit
character. I had a copy made which was sent to Professor Wilson; but the
work of the copyist was found to be too incorrect to admit of its being
read. T‘ien-t‘ai is about fifty miles south of Ningpo, and is celebrated
for its beautiful scenery. As a monastic establishment it dates from the
fourth century, while P‘u-to is no earlier than the tenth. In the
province of Che-kiang, where

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

maritime and hill scenery are so luxuriantly combined, the picturesque
homes of the Buddhist monks are clustered together more thickly, it
would seem, than anywhere else. Like their English contemporaries whose
mode of life was in many points so similar, they knew well how to choose
spots where the rich landscape spread before their eyes would be some
compensation for their banishment from social enjoyments. They were
quite as inventive too in peopling the woods and rocks where they
selected their place of retirement with supernatural visitors, whose
rank or good deeds lent a mysterious sanctity to the place where traces
of their presence were observed. And they framed with equal facility
marvellous legends to form a ground for erecting temples in honour of
the hero thus endowed with an imaginary immortality. The Bodhisattwas
and "Arhans" (*Lo-han*) of Oriental religious fiction, correspond to the
saints and martyrs venerated in the West. Those who chose the situations
of many of the large Buddhist establishments must have had an eye for
the loveliness of nature. The ignorant and unreflecting class of priests
now usually met with, whose aim is no higher than to count beads, to
chant the classics, and to perform the genuflexions according to rule,
must not be taken as examples of the earlier race of Buddhist monks.
There was in the flourishing days of Buddhism more devotion to the
system, and a much better appreciation of its nature, than at present.
It was quite in keeping with a more sincere belief in the religion, to
choose beautiful solitudes high among hills for the practice of its
rites, and to spare no expense in constructing appropriate edifices in
the most magnificent style of Chinese architecture. It is only by
supposing sincere attachment to the principles of the system, that cases
of self-destruction by fire in imitation of the ancient Hindoo practice
can be accounted for. History says that the emperor Jen-tsung, having as
a high mark of favour introduced into the standard edition of Buddhist
books some works by the priests of T‘ien-t‘ai,

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

one of the monks performed this terrible feat to show his gratitude for
the emperor's goodness. Another prevailing motive in uniting the utmost
attainable beauty in nature and art, was undoubtedly the desire to
produce popular effect, and to provide attractions for the rich and the
superstitious when they went on a religious pilgrimage.

Among these spots none in all China is more famous than the island of
P‘u-to, to the east of Chusan. It was about A.D. 915 that it was taken
possession of by the Buddhists, not many years before the time this
narrative has reached. It is dedicated to "Kwan-shï-yin," a name
translated from the Sanscrit *Avalokiteshwara*. P‘u-hien
(*Samantabhadra*), another fictitious Bodhisattwa, is honoured in a
similar way at O-mei Shan, in Sï-ch‘wen. At Kieu-hwa, in An-hwei, a
little westward of Ch‘ï-cheu fu, Ti-tsang another of the great
Bodhisattwas, is honoured with special worship. The fourth and last of
these establishments, the great gathering-places of the followers of
Julai, is that of "Manjusiri" (*Wen-shu p‘u-sa*) at Wu-t‘ai in Shan-si,
already referred to. The name "P‘u-to" (*P‘u-ta*) is the same as that
known in Indian ancient geography as "Potala" or "Potaraka"
(*P‘u-ta-lo-kia*). Kwan-shï-yin is said in the *Hwa-yen-king* to have
taught the Buddhist doctrines on that island. The original island was
situated in the Southern sea of Indian geographers, and P‘u-to is
therefore denominated *Nan-hai p‘u-to* (the P‘u-to of the Southern sea).
Through the Sung and Yuen dynasties buildings were added till they grew
to their present magnitude. The number of priests from all parts of
China who visit this sacred island is immense. <span
id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md)

The residents, however, are not so numerous as at T‘ien-t‘ai. T‘ien-t‘ai
was at this time become famous for

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

the origination of a new school. The works by Chinese authors mentioned
above as placed parallel with the translations from Sanscrit, consisted
of the productions of this school called *Chï-kwan-hio* or
*T‘ien-t‘ai-kiau*. The common book of prayers, *Ta-pei-ts‘an*, has the
same origin. The object of this new school was to combine contemplation
with image worship. While the regulations for kneeling and chanting by
several persons in unison are most complicated and minute, the operators
aim to fix their thoughts on certain objects of devotion. This system
differs from Bodhidharma's school of pure mental abstraction, by adding
to devotional thoughts the helps of the senses. The tawdry gaiety of the
idols, the union of many persons under the direction of a time-keeper in
kneeling and standing, mute thought and loud recitation, it was believed
would have a highly useful influence, when combined with an intense
effort after pure religious meditation. The union of these two elements
was intended to be a great improvement on the previous methods. The
first Buddhist worship had made no express provision for the meditative
faculties, and it had in consequence degenerated into the driest of
forms. The common ceremonial of the sect at the present time exemplifies
it, exhibiting as it does postures devoid of all reverence and lifeless
repetitions of foreign words destitute of all emotion. The founder of
this new system, Chï-k‘ai, lived at T‘ien-t‘ai in the latter half of the
sixth century. It was not till after more than four centuries that the
principal writings of the school he established were included among the
standard books of Buddhism. The title by which he is known is
T‘ien-t‘ai-chï-che. The ceremonial thus introduced still maintains its
reputation, and is practised by those who wish to infuse a deeper
feeling into the service of the religion than is aimed at by the
every-day worshippers of Buddha.

These changing forms of Chinese Buddhism—and there are others that will
subsequently be described—are facts

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

not without significance for the religious history of mankind, that most
interesting chapter in the chronicle of our race. Human nature, true to
itself, will run the same round of varieties in connection with
religions most different in their origin, principles, and geographical
situation. Christianity has been greatly affected in the form that it
has assumed in successive ages by the operation of the natural religious
feelings inherent in man, which are the parents of all superstition and
are independent of the new spiritual life bestowed by Divine power. This
fact, which is clearly exhibited in Church history, renders the
historical comparison between Christianity and other religions a
possible one. The monastic institute, for example, which began in
Buddhism, as its earliest books show, with Shakyamuni the founder of the
religion, was in Christianity an innovation originating in the desire
felt by many to engage constantly in religious contemplation, without
being interrupted by the cares of secular life. In the history of both
religions there have been leading minds that have elevated contemplation
at the expense of external forms. Others have sought by sensible
representations alone to call the religious feelings into action. Minds
of a third class have combined the two. But when Buddhism proceeds to
the negation of all thought, action, and individual existence, the
parallel fails, for though philosophy has intruded frequently and
extensively into the battle-field of Christianity, it has never been
attempted to construct a new religious life on such a basis of
philosophy as this. Philosophical scepticism in the West has been
confined to the safer regions of speculation, without being brought, as
Buddhism has tried to bring it, to a practical form. <span
id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_76.md) Another subdivision of the Buddhist
schools into *Tsung-men* and *Kiau-men* may be best characterised by
using the terms *esoteric* and *exoteric* to distinguish them. The first
of the former entered China when the patriarch

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bodhidharma
brought the traditional symbol, called in Chinese *cheng-fa-yen-tsung*,
and the school he established is its highest kind. The magical formulæ
*cheu* (dharani) also belong to esoteric Buddhism. These childish
productions are as destitute of meaning in their original Sanscrit as
they are in their transferred Chinese form, but all sorts of miracles
are believed to be wrought by them. The classics and books of prayers,
with the other parts of the literature, belong to exoteric Buddhism,
which also embraces all rules for life and worship. For this
classification the native terms in use are *hien*, "open," and *mi*,
"secret."

The despotic nature of the Chinese government has been often shown in
its treatment of religions. When persecution has not been resorted to,
the right of interference in the internal regulations of Buddhism and
Tauism has been often assumed. Thus the Sung emperor, Shen-tsung,
ordered many of the "temples" denominated *sï* to be changed into the
"monasteries" called *ch‘an-yuen*, for the use of the monks who followed
the system of Bodhidharma. His successor issued a similar decree. In
1119, Hwei-tsung, advised by Lin Ling-su, commanded the title of Buddha
to be changed to one like those of the Tauist genii. He was to be styled
*Ta-kio-kin-sien*, in which *kio*, to "perceive," is a translation of
the word Buddha, and *kin*, *i.e.*, "golden," represents the substance
of which his image is supposed to be formed. The other Indian titles
were also ordered to be abandoned. The "priests," instead of being known
as *seng*, were to be called *te-shï*, "virtuous scholars." The
"temples," *sï*, and "monasteries," *yuen*, were to receive the
designations *kung*, "palace," and *kwan*, "monastery," terms in use
among the Tauists. This futile attempt to amalgamate the two religions
was abandoned the following year.

The two brother philosophers, C‘heng, in the city of Lo-yang, set
themselves against the Buddhist burial rites. But an admirer compared
them to the rock in the middle

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

of a torrent, which can retard but for a moment the progress of the
impetuous stream.

Sï-ma Wen-kung wrote soon after that men need not practise burial rites
for deliverance from hell, because neither heaven nor hell are to be
expected. The body decays at death, and the spirit flies off, carried
away by a puff of wind.—(See Watters.)

At that time, as at the present day, Buddhist priests were invited by
rich persons to go through a ritual for the dead. The follower of
Confucius engages priests from both the other sects without scruple to
offer prayers, in whose efficacy he does not believe, for the souls of
deceased relatives. By the Oriental, sincerity and independence in
religious belief are without difficulty subordinated to the outward show
of respect which is felt to be necessary while it is unreal. When, as
death approached, a certain mandarin prohibited the employment of
Buddhist priests at his funeral, the incident is commemorated as
something remarkable. In justification of himself he quoted the saying
of an author, "That if there were no heaven there was no need to seek
it; and that if there were, good men would certainly go there. If there
were no hell there was no need to fear it; and if there were, bad men
would go there."

In the times of Buddhist prosperity persons received from the emperor a
written permission to become *ho-shang* <span
id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_77.md) or "monks." When this practice was
abandoned, as by Kau-tsung, one of the emperors who reigned at
Hang-cheu, A.D. 1143, the higher members of the Buddhist hierarchy
undertook to distribute the usual certificates of membership in the
order. Thus the aim of the emperor,

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

who had argued that for want of imperial patronage the inmates of the
monasteries would be thinned in numbers, until death effected what
former emperors had sought to accomplish by persecution, was frustrated.
When the neophyte visits the chief monk at some monastery, in order to
go through the ceremonies of initiation, an indentation is usually burnt
in at the top of his shaven head, and a new one is made at every
repetition of the visit. A priest is proud to show these marks of
distinction, arranged in a square on his naked cranium, as testifying to
the self-denial he has practised in attaining his position.

There are various evidences of the continued influence of Indian
Buddhism on that of China at this comparatively late period. The
"History of the Sung Dynasty," in its account of India, details the
arrival in A.D. 951 of Samanta, a monk, with a large party of companions
from Western India, belonging to sixteen families. In 965 a Chinese
priest, named Tau-yuen, returned from a journey to the Western countries
with relics and Sanscrit copies of Buddhist books written on the
"palm-leaf" *(pei-to*) to the number of forty volumes. He was absent
twelve years, and resided in India itself half of that time. He returned
by the usual route round the north-west of the great mountain mass
denominated Ts’ung-ling. He gave an account of his travels to the
emperor on his return, and showed him the Sanscrit books. The next year
157 Chinese priests set out together, with the emperor's permission, to
visit India and obtain Buddhist books. They passed through Pu-lu-sha and
"Cashmere" (*Ka-shi-mi-lo*), but nothing is said of their further
proceedings. During the latter part of the tenth century Sanscrit
manuscripts continued to arrive at court in great numbers. On one
occasion the son of a king of Eastern India was a visitor. The reason of
his abandoning his native land, continues our authority, was that it is
customary for the younger sons of a deceased king to leave their eldest
brother at home to

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

succeed their father, and themselves become monks. They travel then to
other countries and never return. These extracts from the "Sung History"
are continued, because they are not only valuable in themselves, but
because also there is some uncertainty as to the time when Buddhism was
expelled from India, and they may be of assistance in determining that
question. In 982 a priest of Western China returned from India with a
letter from a king of that country to the emperor. It was translated by
an Indian at the imperial command, and contained congratulations on the
favour shown in China to Buddhism, together with geographical details on
India and adjacent countries. The next year another Chinese monk
returned by sea with Buddhist books from India. On his way he met at
San-fo-t‘si, a country bordering on Cambodia to the south-west, an
Indian who wished to come to China to translate Buddhist books. He was
invited by the emperor to engage in so doing. Other traces occur, not
seldom in Chinese history, of the presence of Buddhist Indians in the
Birmese peninsula, some of them of the Brahman caste. The rising
influence of Brahmanism, and the more modern forms of religious belief
in India, drove the followers of Shakya, not only into the northern
regions, where they spread their system through Thibet and Tartary, and
by which many of them found their way to China, but also into the
islands and kingdoms that lay on the other side of the Bay of Bengal. A
few years later than the last-mentioned date a Chinese, and with him a
foreign Buddhist monk, came from the king of Northern India with a
letter to the emperor. A Buddhist priest of the Brahman caste, with
Aliyin, a Persian of another religion, are also mentioned as coming to
the capital. The former, in the account he gives of his native country,
mentions Buddhism as the religion favoured by the king. Some came by sea
at this time who could not make themselves understood, but the images
and books they brought showed that they were Buddhists. Several

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

other arrivals of Hindoos are recorded, and if the books they are said
to have presented to the Chinese emperor are still preserved in the
state archives, there can be no lack there of Sanscrit manuscripts of
Buddhist works.

Though the great mass of Buddhist literature was already translated,
additions not a few were made in the Sung and Yuen dynasties, and the
whole number of "chapters" (*kiuen*) raised from 4271 to 4661.

The account given of *Kau-ch‘ang* (the Ouighour country north-west of
China) says that the calendar there used was the one introduced by the
Hindoo Buddhists at the court of the T‘ang dynasty in the early part of
the eighth century. More than fifty Buddhist temples had monumental
tablets presented by emperors of the same dynasty, and, with the
collected sacred books of Buddhism, are also preserved the early Chinese
dictionaries <span id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_78.md) made with the
assistance of the Hindoos. The reader is left to suppose that the
Buddhist classics in the language of China were at that time used in the
countries beyond its northwestern frontier, as they still are in Japan,
Loo-choo, and Corea.

It is added, "Temples of Manes and Persian 'priests' (*senga*) are also
found there, each following his own ritual. These are such as are called
in the Buddhist Sutras 'heretics' (*wai-tau*)." This must be an allusion
to the Manicheans, the fire-worshippers, and probably also to the
Nestorians, who, on the Si-an inscription, call themselves by the
Buddhist term *senga* in the sense of "priest."

From the extended sketch given of Japanese intercourse with China in the
"Sung History," it appears that the object of the majority of the
embassies then and previously was a Buddhist one. Monks were the
ambassadors; books of that religion, such as were known in Japan only by
name, were asked for; remarkable places, like the Wu-t‘ai mountain in
Shan-si, were visited; the doctrines of particular sects, such as that
of [T‘ien-t‘ai](errata.htm#0.md), were studied at the

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

spots where they were principally cultivated; travellers like
Hiuen-tsang were regarded with veneration, and the books that he
intrusted to them, Sutras, Discipline, and Shastras, guarded with
especial care. The impression left on the reader's mind by the narrative
alluded to is, that the early and constant embassies from Japan were
decidedly Buddhistic in their character. Perhaps this arose simply from
the fact of the ambassadors having been monks, while some other cause
led to the appointment of persons of that profession to the duty. At
least, however, it indicates that the Buddhist priests in Japan
possessed for a long period great political influence.

Kublai khan, the first Mongol emperor, was strongly attached to
Buddhism. The imperial temples, for sacrificing to the objects of
Chinese national worship, were converted to Buddhist uses; while Tauism
was persecuted, injunctions were issued to all followers of Buddha to
chant the sacred books diligently in all the monasteries. When Kublai
was recommended by his courtiers to send an army to subjugate Japan, he
refused on the ground that it was a country where the precepts of Buddha
were honoured. A monk of that sect was sent as ambassador, but the king
refused to follow the custom of his ancestor, by sending the tributary
offering that pleases oriental vanity, and marks the submissive
obedience of an inferior sovereign to his more powerful neighbour. A
hundred thousand soldiers were sent to enforce the claim of supremacy
over Japan, and their destruction in a storm while crossing the sea
thither is a well-known fact of history.

The early attachment of the Mongols to Buddhism appears in the first
notices of them in the annals of the dynasty that they overthrew. While
they still possessed only the northern parts of China more than one
Buddhist monk was appointed to the office of *kwo-shï* (national
instructor). The first of these was Namo, a native of one of the Western
kingdoms. Another was *Pa-ho-si-pa* or "Baschpa," a "Thibetan"
(*T‘u-fan*), who introduced a new

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

alphabet for the use of the Mongols based on that of his own language.
It was issued by authority of Kublai khan, but failed to win its way,
perhaps because the characters were less simple than the writing taken
from the Syriac, which had already been adopted from the Nestorians.

In the reign of the successor of Kublai the historians complain that
three thousand taels of gold were set apart to write Buddhist books in
gilt letters, and other expenses for this religion were in the same
proportion of extravagance. The "Yuen History" describes the politic
aims of Kublai in his preference for Buddhism. Becoming sovereign of a
country wild and extensive, and a nation intractable and quarrelsome, he
resolved, in order to give his native wilderness a civilised aspect, and
soften down the natural roughness of his subjects, to form cities on the
Chinese model, to appoint mandarins of various ranks, and put the people
under the guidance of a public instructor. A priest of Buddha held this
post, and he was only subordinate to the chief lay mandarin. His orders
were treated with the same respect as the imperial proclamations. When
all the state officers were assembled he alone remained seated on the
floor in the corner, and he was received at court with the highest
honours that could be paid to a subject.

The remarks of Confucianist historians on such things are naturally
bitter. It is not according to precedent to praise Buddhism. To censure
it is the fashion of the literati. When they wield the historic brush,
they deepen the colouring if superstitious emperors and Buddhist
successes have to appear on the canvas. What they record of censure they
record as a painful duty, and, as often happens when men have a painful
duty to perform, they feel more pleasure in the performance than they
like to acknowledge.

Towards the end of the thirteenth century, a census was taken by
imperial command of the Buddhist temples

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

and monks in China. Of the former, there were reported 42,318, and of
the latter, 213,148. Three years after, at the close of Kublai's reign,
when a priest came from "Thibet" (*Si-fan*) to become *kwo-shï*
(national instructor), the emperor, regretting that he could not
converse with him, ordered Kalutanasi, a Mongolian, to learn the
Thibetan language from him. This task was accomplished in a year, and,
says the narrative, the complete translation of the Buddhist Sutras and
Shastras, from "Thibetan" (*Si-fan*), <span
id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79.md) and Sanscrit into Mongolian, and written
in Ouighour characters, was presented to the founder of the Yuen dynasty
in the year of his death, A.D. 1294. He ordered it to be cut on blocks,
and distributed among the kings and great chiefs of his nation. The
notices of Buddhism that occur in the reigns of the successive Mongol
emperors are extremely numerous, but they belong perhaps more to
Mongolian and Thibetan Buddhism than to that of China, and it will be
only necessary, therefore, to take a brief review of them. The
recitation of the classics was frequently practised in the Thibetan
language in the monasteries of the capital at the emperor's command. In
1324 a second record occurs of the translation into Mongolian of the
Buddhist books. It merely says that the translation from the *Si-fan*
(Thibetan) language was then made in the "Ouighour" (*Wei-ngu-rï*)
writing. Those who received the highest religious title, that of
*kwo-shï* or *ti-shï*, "imperial instructor," were foreigners. One of
these, Pi-lan-na-shi-li, of the Kan-mu-lu kingdom, learned in his youth
the Ouighour and "Sanscrit" (*Si-t‘ien*, "Western heaven") writing. In
1312 he was ordered by the emperor to translate Buddhist books. From
Chinese he translated the *Leng-yen-king*, a Sutra regarded by the
Chinese literati as the best of all the Buddhist books. From Sanscrit he
translated four Sutras, and others from Thibetan, in all a thousand
"chapters" (*kiuen*). He was put to death for suspected treason,
concerted with the

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

son of the king of the An-si country on the eastern border of Persia.
The Mongol emperors continued faithful to their adopted creed during the
short continuance of their power in China. It was, as it has continued
to be, one of their national institutions. The people accepted the
religion that their chiefs appointed for them. While among the Chinese
people, Buddhism has frequently had to struggle against direct and
indirect hostility from the literary class and the government of the
country, the Mongolians have beheld without envy the priests of this
religion raised to the highest offices of state, and retaining
unquestioned their position as the most influential body in the
community.

The immoral pictorial representations introduced in the worship of Shiva
were imitated by the Thibetan Buddhists. When brought to one of the
Mongolian emperors by a Thibetan priest, he is said to have received
them with approbation. The Chinese people were indignant when they heard
that such representations were permitted to demoralise the inmates of
the imperial palace. At present, although some authors have asserted the
contrary, there appear to be no traces of any such practice in Chinese
Buddhism, but they are found in the lama temples in Peking.

Curiosity to visit the first home of their religion had not yet entirely
forsaken the Chinese Buddhists. Early in this period a Chinese priest
named Tau-wu was excited by reading the accounts of Fa-hien and the
early Buddhist travellers to try his fortune in a similar undertaking.
He passed the Sandy desert, and through the kingdoms of Kui-tsi and
Sha-la to *Kipin* (Cophen). He there learned the original language of
the Buddhist books, obtained a Sutra on the admission of Kwan-shi-yin to
the Buddhist life, and turning westward proceeded through the country of
the Getæ and so into India. He returned by sea to Canton. This, however,
is the last record of the kind.

There was no reaction against Buddhism for some time after the overthrow
of the Yuen dynasty. Monks of that

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

religion from the countries west of China were still welcomed at court,
and decrees were promulgated applauding the beneficial tendencies of the
system. When a mandarin ventured to reprove the third Ming emperor on
this account, he was silenced by the inquiry, Did he wish to imitate Han
Wen-kung? In A.D. 1426 the next occupier of the throne ordered
examinations to be instituted for those who wished to become monks. At
this time, as had sometimes happened before, the attention of the
government was called to the increasing property in land of the
monasteries. In 1450 it was forbidden to any monastic establishment to
have more than 60 *meu* (6000 feet square) of land. What was in excess
of this was given to the poor to cultivate, they paying taxes to the
emperor. Similar acts of interference with the property of the
monasteries are recorded in the preceding dynasty. In the sixteenth
century, in the time of Kia-tsing, some attempts to revive persecution
were made by Confucian memorialists, but all they succeeded in effecting
was the destruction of the Buddhist chapel belonging to the palace. High
titles were still granted to certain priests who stated that they came
from the West. They were called *shang-shï*, "superior teacher," instead
of *ti-shï*, "imperial teacher," the title given in the Yuen dynasty.

In the latter years of the Ming dynasty, new enemies to Buddhism arrived
in China. The Roman Catholic missionaries followed the Mohammedans in
protesting against idolatry. The banner of hostility could be raised by
Christians with more reason against this religion than against the
national one, of which the worship of images forms no part. Matteo Ricci
had a controversy with a noted Buddhist priest residing at Hang-cheu. It
was with a show of reason pressed upon the Buddhists that if their
theory of transmigration were true, it would be wrong to enter into
wedlock for fear of marrying one's own father or mother. The Buddhists
suggested in reply, that divination

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

would reveal if such were the fact. Sü Kwang-k‘i, Ricci's most
illustrious convert, wrote a short tract against Buddhism, in which a
few of its principal doctrines are discussed and condemned in a popular
style. It is concluded by a chapter against ancestral worship. The work
is called *P‘i-shih-shï-chu-wang*, "The Errors of the Buddhists
Exposed."

Of the Manchu emperors, Shun-chï was a friend to Buddhism, and wrote
prefaces to some works of the followers of Bodhidharma, but his son
K‘ang-hi felt in his later life great repugnance to all religions except
the Confucian. His sentiments are recorded in the "Sacred Edict," or
Imperial book of moral instructions for the common people.

By insertion in the "Sacred Edict" these opinions have been widely
spread, and are extensively approved of to the present time. The author
cites the judgment pronounced by Chu Hi, the philosopher and critic of
the Sung dynasty, saying that the Buddhists care nothing for heaven or
earth, or anything that goes on around them, but attend exclusively each
to his single mind. They are then condemned for fabricating groundless
tales of future happiness and misery. They are charged with doing this
only for gain, and encouraging for the same object the large gatherings
of the country population at the temples; ostensibly to burn incense,
but really to practise the worst forms of mischief.

Policy has led the Manchu emperors to adopt a very different tone in
Mongolia and Thibet. The lamas of those countries are received at Peking
with the utmost respect, and care has always been taken to avoid
exciting a religious animosity that would be fraught with danger.

At the present time in the parts of China open to foreign observation,
each country village has its annual festival, at which thousands
assemble from distances of many miles to witness processions of the
images, and join

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

in the idolatrous ceremonies to which the day is consecrated. It is the
same to the people whether it be a Buddhist or Tauist temple, where the
concourse takes place. Their worship and offerings are presented with
equal willingness in either, and whatever story is told of the power of
any idol they are ready to believe.

The feeling of the educated is different from this. Despising the
popular development of Buddhism, as consisting of image worship and
procuring for money the protection of powerful unseen beings, they read
with interest those of the Buddhist books that have in them a vein of
metaphysical thought presented in elegant language. They study Buddhism
for the profundity of its ideas, while they continue to adhere to
Confucius, as their own chosen teacher in morals and religion. In the
wide literature of this system there is room for readers of very various
predilections. There are several works of which metaphysical discussion
is the prominent feature, and they are read with pleasure by the
intelligent, to whom a further attraction is the excellent native style
adopted by the scholars who assisted in the translation. Such, for
example, are the *Kin-kang-king* and the *Leng-yen-king*.

There are, however, not a few sincere Buddhists, chiefly in the middle
class of society, who believe that there is a great merit and efficiency
in the recitation of the sacred books. They have a higher aim than those
who practise the mere burning of incense to secure particular forms of
happiness. They engage in the reading of these books or enter on the
life of a hermit or monk, hoping to quiet the passions and train the
heart to virtue.

Hermits are not uncommonly met with in the vicinity of large Buddhist
establishments. They occupy hill-side caves, or a closed apartment,
which for a certain term of years they never leave. Their hair is
allowed to grow unshorn. Their food is brought them by the monks of a
neighbouring monastery. They employ their time in reciting the sacred
books, meditation on Buddhist doctrine,

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

care of their cell, and replenishing the incense urn placed before the
image of Shakyamuni.

The preceding pages may be regarded as a sketch of the external history
of Chinese Buddhism. A notice of the successive schools into which this
religion has subdivided itself will now be presented to the reader.

NOTE ON INDIAN SCIENCE AND ART.

<span class="small">The Hindoos borrowed copiously from Babylon and
other western countries. If in the eighth and ninth centuries they used
what we call the Indian arithmetical notation in giving mathematical
instruction to the Chinese, it was because they had already learned it
from Babylonian teachers. The decipherment of mathematical inscriptions
from Mesopotamia shows that long before the age of David and Solomon
this notation was in common use there. So in art the Hindoos copied the
Greeks. After Alexander's invasion of India the Hindoos became
sculptors. They carved Buddhist friezes by the help of Greek suggestion.
Vincent A. Smith says in the volume for 1889 of the Journal of the
Bengal Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, that the Hindoos followed
Greek prototypes when planning buildings, images, and pillars. This is
the reason that the metempsychosis appears somewhat late in Indian
literature. It too was of foreign origin.</span>

<span id="fn_38"></span>[88:1](cbu11.htm#fr_38.md) He had the dream in A.D.
61. Eighteen men were sent. They went to the country of the Getæ,
bordering on India, and there they met the two Brahmans. They came
riding on white horses, with pictures, images, and books; and arrived in
A.D. 67. On the thirtieth day of the twelfth month they saw the emperor.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[88:2](cbu11.htm#fr_39.md) *Ta-hia*, in old Chinese
*Dai-he*. It was 207 years earlier that the Dale and Getæ were defeated
in battle by Alexander. Dahistan borders on the Caspian, forming the
south-east coast of that sea.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[89:1](cbu11.htm#fr_40.md) He foretold future
events by interpreting the sound of pagoda bells as they were blown by
the wind. On one occasion he placed water in an empty flower-pot, and
burned incense, when a blue lotus sprang into view in full bloom.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[89:2](cbu11.htm#fr_41.md) The syllables *Sang-mun*
are also employed. *Shramana* means the "quieting of the passions."
*Sih-sin*, "to put the mind at rest," is the Chinese translation of it.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[90:1](cbu11.htm#fr_42.md) See the *Ts’in history*.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[91:1](cbu11.htm#fr_43.md) *Foĕ* *kouĕ ki*,
translated by Remusat; from the preface to which, some of the facts
given above are taken. The original work, *Fo-kwo-ki*, is contained in
the collection denominated *Shwo-fu*, a *Ts’ung-shu* (selection of
extracts and hooks old and new) of the reign of Shun-chï. Also in the
*Han-wei-ts’ung-shu*.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[92:1](cbu11.htm#fr_44.md) The common Indian name
of "China," written in Chinese *Chen-tan*, is here employed. Another
orthography found in Buddhist books is *Chi-na*. It is clear from the
use of these characters, that the Indians who translated into Chinese at
that early period, did not regard the word "China" as the name of a
dynasty, but as the proper name of the country to <span id="page_93">p.
93</span> which it was applied. This leaves in great uncertainty the
usual derivation of the term "China" from the *Dzin* dynasty, B.C. 250,
or that of *Ts’in*, A.D. 300. The occurrence of the word as the name of
a nation in the "Laws of Manu," supposed to date from some time between
B.C. 1000 and B.C. 500, with the use of the term "Sinim" in the
"Prophecies of Isaiah," indicate a greater antiquity than either of
these dynasties extends to. Some have supposed that the powerful
feudatory kingdom, Dzin, that afterwards grew into the dynasty of that
name, may have originated the appellation by which the whole country
subject to the Cheu emperors was known to the Hindoos. Dzin occupied the
north-western tract now called Shen-si and Kan-su. It was that part of
China that would be first reached by traders coming from Kashgar,
Samarcand, and Persia. *Chen-tan*, the other Hindoo name of "China" used
in the Buddhist books, may be the *Thinæ* of Ptolemy. When the first
Buddhists reached China, the character used for writing the first of
these two syllables would be called *Tin*, and soon afterwards *Chin*.
In Julien's *Méthode*, &c., its Sanscrit equivalent is *Chin*. This
would be somewhat late. Would it not be better, having traced the term
to India, to make that country responsible for its etymology?

<span id="fn_45"></span>[93:1](cbu11.htm#fr_45.md) At that time the
territory of Yang-cheu embraced Kiang-nan, with parts of Ho-nan and
Kiang-si. Jambu, the southern continent, is one of the four Indian
divisions of the world. India is in its centre.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[94:1](cbu11.htm#fr_46.md) *Shï-tsï-kwo*, the "Lion
kingdom," translated from the Sanscrit name *Sinhala*, whence
"Singhalese."

<span id="fn_47"></span>[97:1](cbu11.htm#fr_47.md) When the Buddhist has
become sufficiently enlightened, an ideal picture of Buddhistic doctrine
presents itself to his mind. It is called *Fa-shen* or *Fa-siang*.
Elsewhere, as in the "Diamond Sutra," it is spoken of as a state that
can be arrived at, but here it seems rather to mean an object of mental
vision.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[98:1](cbu11.htm#fr_48.md) *Kiew-ta’euen-chï-hia*,
a common phrase for "death."

<span id="fn_49"></span>[102:1](cbu11.htm#fr_49.md) *Pi-kwan*
"*p’o-lo-men*" (in old Chinese, *Ba-la-men*).

<span id="fn_50"></span>[106:1](cbu11.htm#fr_50.md) The *Northern Wei
History* gives the date of Shakyamuni's birth, B.C. 688, which is much
nearer than the common date, to the time required by the evidence.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[107:1](cbu11.htm#fr_51.md) Of the interest felt by
Sanscrit scholars in this subject, the letter of Professor Wilson,
formerly Sanscrit Professor at Oxford, to Sir John Bowring is evidence.
He invited the attention of the "China Branch of the Royal Asiatic
Society" to the translations made by Hiuen-tsang in the T’ang dynasty,
and the Sanscrit original works brought by that traveller to his native
land.

Of the Chinese translations I collected more than fifty while residing
at Shanghai, for the library of the India House. Recently Rev. S. Beal
has published an interesting account of these translations in the
*Transactions of the Oriental Congress*, held in London, 1374.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[108:1](cbu11.htm#fr_52.md) In A.D. 226. This Roman
was named Dzinlon. After describing his country to the Chinese prince,
he was sent back honourably. His name looks in its Chinese form as if it
were translated. See the "Liang History"—*India*.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[108:2](cbu11.htm#fr_53.md) In Sanscrit, *Saddharma
Pundarika Sutra*.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[110:1](cbu11.htm#fr_54.md) *Ch‘ang-a-han king*.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[110:2](cbu11.htm#fr_55.md) *Sï-fun-lü*.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[110:3](cbu11.htm#fr_56.md) *Shih-sung-lü*.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[111:1](cbu11.htm#fr_57.md) Mr. Watters, citing the
"Mirror of History," *Tung-kien*, chap. cccxvi., says, "Every household
almost had been converted, and the number of those who had taken the
vows was so great that the labours of the field were frequently
neglected for lack of workmen."

<span id="fn_58"></span>[112:1](cbu11.htm#fr_58.md) See my *Introduction to
the Study of the Chinese characters*.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[114:1](cbu11.htm#fr_59.md) Remusat supposed that
this alphabet was borrowed by the Coreans from the Nü-chih and Kie-tan,
who had invented a writing of their own, and ruled in Corea in the
eleventh and twelfth centuries; but such an hypothesis <span
id="page_115">p. 115</span> is incompatible with the fact that the
Corean letters are more like the Thibetan and Sanscrit letters.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[115:1](cbu11.htm#fr_60.md) The *lu-tau* here
alluded to are the modes of existence into which, in the revolutions of
the metempsychosis, all will be born who have not been saved by the
teaching of Buddha. They are:—(1.) *T’ien*, the *Devas* of the Hindoos
(Lat. *deus*); (2.) Man; (3.) *Asura* and *Mara*, superior classes of
demons. Both these words are transferred. The former is transliterated
by characters now read *sieu-lo* (in old Chinese, *su-la*), the latter
by *mo* (*ma*), a character invented for the occasion by Liang Wu-ti,
and which has passed into familiar colloquial in some dialects as
*mo-kwei*, in the sense of "demon." (4.) "Hell," the prison of the lost,
*ti-yu;* (5.) *Ngo-kwei*, wandering "hungry spirits;" (6.) Animals.

The use of *T‘ien*, "Heaven," in a personal sense, as the translation of
the Sanscrit *Deva*, whether in the singular or plural, is, perhaps,
more common in Buddhist works than its use in a local sense. In
explaining this new meaning of the word, *Deva* is transcribed as
(*De-ba*) *T‘i-p‘o*.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[116:1](cbu11.htm#fr_61.md) It was about this time
that the contests between Chosroes king of Persia, and the Turks on one
side, and the Byzantine emperor on the other, occurred. The same events
that have been described by Gibbon's luxuriant pen are found in a form
more laconic and curtailed in the "History of the T‘ang Dynasty." It
might well be so, when Chinese travellers passed the eastern borders of
Persia on their way to India, and when the imperial occupants of the
throne of Constantinople sent embassies frequently to China. There are
two records of these embassies preserved, the interest of which will be
a sufficient excuse for a short digression. In A.D. 643, says the
history, Pa-ta-lik, the king of the Fulim country, sent an embassy with
presents of red glass. That this king was a Byzantine emperor is shown
by the narrative of events in Persia just preceding it in <span
id="page_117">p. 117</span> the history. It says, "At the close of the
Sui dynasty (ended A.D. 657), the "khan" (*k’a-han*) of the Western
"Turks" (*Tu-kiue*) attacked "Persia" (*Pa-si*), and killed the king
*K’u-sa-ha* (Chosroes I., or Nushirvan). His son *Shi-li* (Hormouz)
succeeded him. After his death the daughter of K’u-sa-ha was made queen,
but was killed by the Turks. Shi-li's son *Jen-ki* (Chosroes II.) fled
to Fulim. (Gibbon says he took refuge with the Romans.) The people of
the country brought him back and made him king. He was assassinated by
*I-t’a-chi*, and succeeded by his brother's son *I-dzi-zi* (Yezdegerd)."
This prince sent an embassy to China, A.D. 638. For misconduct he was
driven away by his nobles, and fled to the *T’u-ha-la*, a tribe in
Afghanistan. On his way he was put to death by the Arabs (*Ta-shih*).
*Pi-lu-si* the son of *I-dzi-zi* appealed to the court at Ch’ang-an for
aid against the irresistible Arabians, but in vain. These last details
have been introduced by Gibbon into his narrative from De Guignes. It
may be inferred, then, that the king *Pa-ta-lik* was the Byzantine
emperor "Constans II." In the year 1081 there was also an embassy to
China from the king of Fulim, who is called *Mih-li-i-ling kai-sa*. This
*Kaisar* or "Cæsar" should be either Nicephorus Bataniares, who died
this year, or his successor, Alexius Comnenus. In *Kin-shï-t‘u-shu-pu*,
a Chinese work on coins and other antiquities, there is a rude
representation of a gold coin of this prince.

The word *Fulim* is evidently the same as the Thibetan *Philing* and the
Indian *Feringi*, which, as Hodgson observes, must be variations of the
word "Frank," commonly applied to all Europeans in Western Asia. Modern
Chinese authors suppose Judæa to be *Fulim*, but the old passages in the
Syrian inscription and elsewhere, in which the country is described as
to its natural features, whether under this name or that of *Ta-ts’in*,
read much more intelligibly if the Roman empire be understood.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[119:1](cbu11.htm#fr_62.md) This work has been
recently reprinted, in the collection entitled
*Sheu-shan-ko-ts‘ung-shu*, at Sung-kiang, near Shanghai.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[120:1](cbu11.htm#fr_63.md) Vide Professor Wilson's
letter published by the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, at
Hongkong.

The changes in orthography adopted by Hiuen-tsang, may be made use of to
show, that it was from Sanscrit and not Pali originals, that the Chinese
Buddhist hooks were translated. He spells *tope* or "pagoda,"
*su-t‘u-pa*. In Pali the word is *t‘upa*, and in Sanscrit *st‘upa*.
Before Hiuen-tsang's time, the initial *s* was not expressed, probably
for brevity, or through the influence of a local Indian dialect. Other
examples might also be adduced. There is another use that may be made of
these orthographical changes. As compared with preceding transcriptions,
they are an index to the alterations that were taking place in the
Chinese language itself. For convenience the age of Buddhist
translations may be divided into three periods: (1.) A.D. 66, when
Buddhism entered China, and the "Sutra of Forty-two Sections" was
translated; (2.) A.D. 405, the age of Kumarajiva; (3.) A. D. 646, the
age of Hiuen-tsang. The Sanscrit syllable *man* had been written with
the character for "literature," <span id="page_121">p. 121</span> *wen*.
Hiuen-tsang adopted a character now as then heard, man. He changed the
name of the Ganges from *Heng*, "Constant," to *Ch‘ing-ch‘ia*
(*Gang-ga*). Comparison with existing dialects shows, that the Sanscrit
pronunciation may be assigned without hesitation to the characters
chosen, as nearly the sound that then belonged to them in Northern
China, and one example is an index to a multitude of other words,
passing through the same change at the same time. The three periods here
given will help to supply the chronology of these changes, extending
through almost all the sounds in the language. Thus, with other aid, the
age of the Mandarin language may be fixed with comparative certainty.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[123:1](cbu11.htm#fr_64.md) A translation of a work
by the same author, on the prophetic character of dreams, is also
alluded to.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[124:1](cbu11.htm#fr_65.md) *Shanghai Almanac* for
5853—"Jottings on the Science of the Chinese."

<span id="fn_66"></span>[125:1](cbu11.htm#fr_66.md) Chief representative of
the Tantra school in China, and author of the festival for hungry
ghosts. He is also called Amogha Vajra, and his school is that called
the Yogachara.(Eitel.)

<span id="fn_67"></span>[127:1](cbu11.htm#fr_67.md) Liang Wu-ti was
eighty-six years of age when he died. His adopted son, whom he had
appointed to succeed him, withheld the supplies of food that the aged
emperor needed, and he died in consequence.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[127:2](cbu11.htm#fr_68.md) Watters, in *Chinese
Recorder*, 1869, July, p. 40. The proverb *T‘ang Fo*, "Buddha of the
T‘ang," means to be as devoted to Buddhism as was the T‘ang dynasty.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[129:1](cbu11.htm#fr_69.md) The other two orders of
Buddhist monks are (r.) *Lü-shï*, or "Disciplinists," who go barefoot
and follow rigidly the rules enjoined in the early ages of Buddhism, for
the observance of all who entered on the ascetic life; (2.) *Fa-shï*, or
those who perform the common duties of priests, engage in popular
teaching, and study the literature of their religion. The word *Ch‘an*
(in old Chinese, *jan* and *dan*), originally signifying "resign," had
not the meaning to "contemplate" (now its commonest sense), before the
Buddhists adopted it to represent the Sanscrit term *Dhyana*. The word
in Chinese books is spelt in full *jan-na*, and is explained, "to reform
one's self by contemplation or quiet thought." Perhaps an Eastern
extension of the Jaina, or some lost sect, still existing in India, took
place thus early. The marked difference between the Buddhism of
Bodhidharma, and that already existing in China, requires some such
supposition. These three orders still exist. The common priests met with
in temples are not considered to deserve either denomination, but on the
supposition that they fulfil their duties, they are *Fa-shï*.
Distinguished priests are called *Ch‘an-shï*. The emperors till very
recently have always been accustomed to give names to distinguished
priests. The early translators were honoured with the title *San-tsang
fa-shï*. In common cases the title *Ch‘an-shï* is all that is appended
to the new name given by the imperial favour to those who, from their
learning and character, are supposed to deserve it.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[132:1](cbu11.htm#fr_70.md) The Yoga or Yogachara
school was founded by Asengha, and its system taught in China by
*Pu-k‘ung* (Amogha). It combined Brahmanism, Shivaism, and the doctrine
of Dhyana Buddhas (derived from Nepaul), with the Mahayana philosophy.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[132:2](cbu11.htm#fr_71.md) See the work called
*Ts‘ien-sheu ts‘ien-yen kwan-shï-yin p‘u-sa to-pei-sin to-to-ni*, "The
magical formula of the Bodhisattwa Kwan-shï-yin, who has a thousand
hands and eyes and a merciful heart." "Da-la-ni" (*To-to-ni*) is in
Sanscrit *Dharani*, "a charm." See also the very popular work called
*Yü-k‘ia-yen-k‘eu*, universally used by the priests as a mass-book for
the benefit of the hungry dead, who come, in consequence of the priest's
incantations, from hell, with "flaming mouths" (*yen-k‘eu*) to receive
"sweet dew" (*kan-lu*) and go back relieved.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[132:3](cbu11.htm#fr_72.md) These notices of
foreign Buddhists are taken from the Supplement to the well-known
cyclopædia *Wen-hien-t‘ung-k‘au*.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[135:1](cbu11.htm#fr_73.md) Watters, p. 42.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[137:1](cbu11.htm#fr_74.md) Sanscrit characters are
also contained in such works as *Yü-k‘ia-yen-k‘eu*, which may be seen in
any monastery. In Peking, Sanscrit sentences, chiefly charms, are seen
written under the eaves of the roofs of temples. Some manuscripts have
been brought to foreign residents for sale. They are written in a later
*Devanagari* with the top line, from left to right, distinct in form.
There are also Sanscrit inscriptions on "octagonal
stones"(*shï-chwang*). The *Devanagari* is of an older style without the
top line. They date from the Kin dynasty.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[139:1](cbu11.htm#fr_75.md) The Thibetan
inscriptions at P‘uto, which have frequently attracted the notice of
foreign visitors, probably owe their origin to some far-travelled
devotee from that country. Kwan-shï-yin is the national protector of the
Thibetans, and, as Huc informs us, monuments with the words
*Om-mani-padme-hum*, a sentence which occurs on the P‘u-to stones, are
everywhere seen there.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[141:1](cbu11.htm#fr_76.md) The attempt of Comte
and his half-dozen followers to construct a religion on a basis of
philosophy has been conspicuous only by its failure.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[143:1](cbu11.htm#fr_77.md) The word *ho-shang*, as
the Chinese Life of Buddha informs us, is transferred from the language
of "Udin" (*Yu-tian*) or "Khoten," south-east of Kashgar, and was
originally translated from the Sanscrit *Upâsaka*. *Ho-shang* is now the
universal term for the Buddhist monks. They themselves also use
*ch‘u-kia-jen*, a Chinese term convertible with it. It means "men who
have left the family." *Upadhyâya* is a Sanscrit term for "a self-taught
teacher," and *Hwa-shie* is a vernacular term in Kashgar and Kustana,
and has become *ho-shang* in Chinese.—(Eitel.)
