### CHAPTER II.

#### LIFE OF BUDDHA FROM HIS APPEARANCE AS A TEACHER AT BENARES TO THE CONVERSION OF RAHULA.

IT was exactly thirty-five days after his arriving at perfect wisdom
that Buddha opened his public life at Benares, by discoursing to Godinia
and others on the four truths. "You should know," he said to his
auditors, "the fact of misery (DUK‘A), and the need of becoming
separated from the accumulation of entanglements caused by the passions
(SAMUDAYA). These two truths belong to the world from which you are now
exhorted to take your departure. You should also experience the
extinction of these miseries and entanglements (NIRODA), and the path of
reformation (MARGA). These two truths belong to the monastic life on
which you should now enter."

Having these subjects to discourse on, Buddha went forth to appeal to
the youth of India, the hermits, the followers of the Zoroastrian
fire-worship, the Brahman who studied the Vedas, and to men of every
class.

The wheel of doctrine revolved thrice. There was first didactic
statement, then exhortation, and lastly appeal to evidence and personal
experience. The image is that of grinding. The chaff and refuse are
forced from the

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

good flour by repeated revolutions of the wheel. The statement of facts,
the urgent appeal, and the proof are repeated in the inculcation of each
of the "four truths." The wheel of Buddhist preaching was thus made to
perform twelve revolutions. <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md)

Having once launched the subject under these four heads, it was natural
that the Hindoo minds of the time, fond as they were of dialectical
hair-splitting, should ramify them into numberless subdivisions. They
talked of the eighty-one states of misery, the eighty-eight varieties of
deception, the thirty-seven methods of reformation, &c.

One of Buddha's earliest converts was Godinia, who was attracted by his
teaching upon the four truths, and attained the first grade of clear
vision. It was at Benares, the ancient Varanasi, in the Mrigadava garden
(*Lu-ye-yuen*), that this conversion and that of four others took place.
Thus began the revolving of the wheel of the Buddhist law, which was
destined to spread the new doctrine over so wide a portion of Asia, and
to continue for so many centuries. These new disciples asked to be
permitted to commence the monkish life. This Shakya allowed, saying,
"Bikshus! it is for you to take off your hair, wear the kasha, and
become Shramanas." He discoursed of the non-permanence of human actions,
of the emptiness of the external world, the non-existence of the *Ego*,
the deliverance of the mind from thraldom by the cessation of faults,
and the consequent attainment of the moral and intellectual rank of
Arhan.

"Thus," adds the delighted Buddhist historian, "the world for the first
time had six Arhans, and (including the new doctrine) the *Three
Precious Ones* (*San Pau*). The first was Buddha, the second was the
revolving of the wheel of the doctrine of the four truths (*Dharma*),
and the third was the company of the five Arhans (*Sanga*). Well might
that garden be regarded as the happy land of men and Devas (*T‘ien*)."

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

This was the foundation of the spiritual communities of Buddhism. The
*Sanga*, or assembly of believers, distinguished by common vows of
abstinence from marriage, from animal food, and the occupations of
social life, now commenced. The Sangarama and Vihara, <span
id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md) or *monastery*, was soon rendered
necessary for the residence of the voluntary cœnobites, who daily grew
in numbers, and the greatest social revolution that ever took place in
India was fairly begun.

Soon afterwards, a youth of great intelligence saw in the night-time a
light. He opened the door of the house, and went out in search of the
light. He soon reached Buddha's garden, was taught, became an Arhan, and
requested permission to take the vows, to which Buddha at once
consented. The father of this youth came in search of him, and was also
taught by Buddha. He became a convert; with purged vision took the vows
of adherence to the Three Precious Ones, and returned home to become the
first Upâsaka, or lay brother, keeping the rules, but living at his own
house. It was permitted to the neophyte, if he preferred it, to continue
in the position which he held in social life, and not to join the
monastic community.

As soon as the number had increased to fifty-six, another great step was
taken by Shakyamuni. He broke up the community, and dismissed all its
members to travel everywhere, giving instruction in the doctrine of the
four miseries to all persons with whom they met. This occupation was
connected with begging for food. At this time the Buddhist community had
no property. It was supported by the liberality of the new members, or
by the gifts of rich persons. Whether the monks were in the monastery or
upon their travels, the normal mode of gaining support was by the
charity of neighbours, of passersby, of kings and nobles, and all the
kindly disposed. The system was thus gradually, in the early years of
Shakyamuni's

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

teaching, assuming the form it has taken in all Buddhist countries.
Monastic vows, living in spiritual communities, voluntary poverty, and
universal preaching—these formed the basis on which the great Buddhist
structure was erected. We cannot but admire the wonderful practical
genius of the man who conceived the system, and carried it out with such
triumphant success. In a few years India was covered, through the
labours of the Buddhist preachers, with flourishing communities of
monks, and in the cool season of the year the Bikshus, or religious
mendicants, were everywhere seen on the roads and in the cities teaching
the true path to the Nirvâna.

As Shakyamuni was the first in time of the founders of monastic
communities, so he surpassed them all in the originality of his
conceptions, in the success of his system, and in the force of his
influence.

The Buddhist preachers left their master, who proceeded from Benares to
Magadha. At evening he slept in the house of Uluvilva Kashiapa. He there
subdued a fiery snake, and administered to him the vows of adherence to
Buddha, the Law, and the Priesthood. To produce an impression on
Kashiapa's mind, he enclosed the snake in a rice bowl. Kashiapa was
still deficient in knowledge, but from this time he ripened and
progressed visibly.

On the banks of the Nairanjana river, Shakyamuni had an interview, says
the legend, with his old enemy, the king of the Maras (the Chinese *mo*
in *mo-kwei*, "devil"),who wished to enter the Nirvâna. But Buddha
refused his thrice repeated request, on the ground that he was not
*mentally prepared* for the change. Thus, legend—which was never more
active in inventing wonderful stories about any one than about
Shakyamuni—makes him sovereign over the most powerful supernatural
beings. He did not, however, always refuse applicants for salvation from
other worlds. He is said to have gone up to the Tushita paradise to
instruct his mother Maya in the new law.

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

On the banks of the same river, five hundred fire-worshippers, after
hearing his discourse on the four miseries, became Arhans, and threw
their implements of worship into the river. Their religion—frequently
mentioned in early Buddhist history—was, as it would appear, propagated
from Persia to India not long before the time of Cyrus. In Persia,
fire-worship had been added to the old Magian worship of the heavenly
bodies. But while it had triumphed through Zoroaster's influence in
Persia, it was destined to be expelled from India by Buddhism. With
these new converts, Buddha went to the city of Rajagriha, and was
received there with perfect confidence and admiration. The king
Vimbasâra, Ajatashatru's father, <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) and
all the principal persons in the city, Brahmans, officers, and people,
became his disciples.

The ruins of this city are still visited by the Jains, at a spot sixteen
miles south-west of Bahar. <span id="fr_23"></span>[2](#fn_23.md) It was
the metropolis of the Magadha princes till the era of Ashôka, the
Buddhist monarch who ruled all India about two hundred years after the
time of Shakyamuni. Here Buddha taught for many years, and received some
of his most celebrated disciples, such as Shariputra, Maudgalyayana, and
Kashiapa. At this time Buddha began to appoint the wearing of the
*shangati*, or upper robe, reaching to the knees. It is worn outside the
*kasha*, or long robe, which was in use from the commencement of the
monastic institute.

Three years later, Shakya was invited to Shravasti, to occupy a house
and garden expressly provided for him by the king's eldest son and a
rich noble, as already described. It was the Jetavana Vihara, or
Monastery of Jeta's Garden. Here he was in the kingdom of Kosala, then
ruled by Prasenajita; who, with the chief. persons of influence, were
all in favour of the new doctrine.

Buddha was obliged to become a legislator. As thefts, assassination, and
evil-speaking occurred in his community,

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

he made special rules for the punishment of such crimes
(*Fo-tsu-t‘ung-ki*, iii. 30).

His father sent a messenger to him, after he had been absent from home
for twelve years, to inform him that he wished to see him, and to invite
him to come for a visit. The messenger was a Brahmachâri (a religious
student or observer of Brahmanical rules of purity), named Udaya. On
hearing Buddha discourse, Udaya at once attained to the state of Arhan
(Lohan). Buddha now resolved to go to see his father, and attempt, by
teaching, to save both him and his mother. He sent forward Udaya to
inform the king, and perform before him the eighteen changes—a series of
magical effects. The king was delighted, and went out of the city
thirteen miles, accompanied with an escort of ten thousand persons, to
welcome Shakyamuni, who was conspicuous for his stature—being sixteen
feet in height—and his brilliant golden colour. He appeared like the
moon among the clouds. Around him were many Brahmachâri who had long
been in the woods and mountains, and whose bodies were black. They
seemed like those black-winged birds that fly round the purple-golden
mountain. The king then ordered five hundred youths of distinguished
families to become monks and attend on Buddha, like phoenixes round
Mount Sumeru.

The hermit life in India preceded the monastic life. Buddha himself was
at first a hermit, like the Brahmachâri of the time. But while they
aimed at the old Brahmanical purity, his mind swelled with new thoughts
and aims. They were content to avoid the stains of a secular life. He
was bent on saving multitudes by teaching.

When Buddha was come to see his father after twelve years’ absence, his
wife brought his little son, Rahula, to see him. The boy was just six
years old, and the courtiers doubted if Buddha was his father. Buddha
said to the doubters, "Yashodara has been true to her duty. I will give
proof of it." He then, by his magical power, caused the monks present
all to become Buddhas in

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

appearance. Yashodara then took a signet ring and gave it to the boy,
saying to him, "This is your father's; give it to him." Rahula took it
and gave it at once to Buddha. The king and all the courtiers said,
"Good! this boy is truly the son of Buddha." <span
