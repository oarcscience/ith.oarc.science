### CHAPTER XXVI.

#### BOOKS AND PAPERS THAT MAY BE CONSULTED FOR THE STUDY OF CHINESE BUDDHISM.

<span class="small">*Foĕ* *kouĕ ki*, by Remusat—Works of
Julien—Interesting passage from Fa-hien—Translations by Beal—Schott,
*Über den Buddhaismus in Hoch Asien und in China*—Writings of
Palladius—Eitel's *Hand-book for the Student of Chinese
Buddhism*—Watters’ account of Chinese Buddhism—Eitel's *Three Lectures*,
and article on Nirvâna.</span>

AMONG these works may be mentioned the translation of *Foĕ* *kouĕ ki*,
or "Relation of the Buddhist Kingdoms," by Abel Remusat <span
id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_142.md). This work is very fully annotated by
Remusat, Klaproth, and Landresse.

The same interesting book of Chinese travels has been rendered into
English by the Rev. S. Beal, <span id="fr_143"></span>[2](#fn_143.md) and
also by Mr. H. A. Giles. <span id="fr_144"></span>[3](#fn_144.md) These two
translations have not the advantage of abundant annotations.

The works of Professor Stanislas Julien on Chinese Buddhism are—(1)
*Histoire de la Vie de Hiouen-thsang et de ses Voyages dans l’Inde,
depuis l’an* 629 *jusqu’en* 645; (2) *Mémoires sur les Contrées
Occidentales, Traduits du Sanscrit en Chinois, en l’an* 648, *par
Hiouen-thsang, et du Chinois en Français par S. Julien,* 2 vols., royal
8vo; (3) *Les Avadanas, Contes, et Apologues Indiens*, &c.

These works are characterised by the thorough and exact

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

scholarship of the author. They form a most valuable addition to our
knowledge of India and other Asiatic countries in the seventh century,
and in the Sung period before that time, during which Buddhism had still
the vigour of its youth.

Both Fa-hien and Hiuen-tsang will be admitted by every candid reader to
deserve the reputation for patience in observation, perseverance in
travel, and earnestness in religious faith which they have gained by the
journals and translations they left behind them.

Fa-hien says, near the end of his narrative, that he sailed from Java in
a ship on board of which were about two hundred men. They had provisions
for fifty days, and were bound for Canton. After a month, a tempest and
violent rain almost overwhelmed them. The passengers were all in alarm.
Fa-hien prayed to Kwan-yin, and all the believers in China, to implore
of the gods to give them aid and quell the storm. When it became calm,
the Brahmans on board said that this Samanean, meaning Fa-hien, ought to
be put ashore on an island, because it was he that had brought on them
this hurricane. "Why should we all be exposed to danger for the sake of
one man?"

A friend of Fa-hien said, "If you put this Samanean on shore, put me
ashore also, or else kill me. If you put this Samanean ashore, on
arriving at the land of Han I will denounce you to the king. The king of
the land of Han is very much attached to the doctrine of Buddha and
honours the monks."

The merchants were in doubt what to do, and did not venture on severe
measures. The sky continued thickly overcast, and the embarrassment of
the mariners increased.

They were seventy days on the voyage. Provisions and water began to
fail. The cooks took sea water to use in cooking food, the good water
they kept for drinking. Two pints were assigned to each. As the water
came near its

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

end, the merchants consulted together, and said that the voyage to
Canton ought not to have been more than fifty days. They were long past
this time, and ought now to change their course to the north-west, and
make for the coast.

In twelve days and nights they reached Lau-shan, <span
id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_145.md) on the south shore of the Shan-tung
promontory, and found there good water and beans. After so dangerous a
voyage, with such fatigues and so many fears, they arrived at last at
this unknown shore. On seeing a plant called *Li-ho-ts‘ai*, they were
convinced that they were indeed in China. This plant was a proof of it,
although they met no men nor any traces of men. Some thought they were
all near Canton. Others thought Canton was long passed. No one knew what
part of the coast they had reached.

Going ashore in a boat they met two hunters, and Fa-hien was employed to
interpret. From them they found that they were in Ts’ing-cheu in the
province now known as Shan-tung, and on the north side of the promontory
in the Gulf of Pe-chi-li. From this point the merchants found their way
to Yang-cheu, and Fa-hien to the capital, Ch‘ang-an. This was in the
year A.D. 414.

The student has also at his command—*A Catena of Buddhist Scriptures
front the Chinese*, by Samuel Beal; and *The Romantic Legend of Sâkya
Buddha*, by the same.

The work of Schott, *Über den Buddhaismus in Hoch Asien und in China*,
contains much valuable information on the contents of Chinese Buddhist
books. Written in 1846, it was anterior to the clear drawing of the
boundary between Northern and Southern Buddhism by Burnouf, and also
preceded by several years the publication of Spence Hardy's works on
Singhalese Buddhism, viz., *Eastern Monachism* (1840), and *Manual of
Buddhism* (1843).

He says of Nirvâna that it is the emptiness which every intellectual
object will include in itself when liberated.

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

In so far the Nirvâna is like the original being, before each creative
act; but it differs from the original essence in this, that all forms of
life and matter come out of the original essence, but cannot come from
the Nirvâna; because nothing can come from it, and it is incapable of
having in it any individuality, mental or material.

To the genuine disciple of the Buddhist teaching, to put himself under
the mystic and heaven-sent guide to the Nirvâna, is the *alpha* and
*omega* of his efforts. Just so to the genuine follower of Confucius, to
hold office, to serve the emperor, and become a cabinet minister or
censor, constitute his great earthly aim.

Our author points out, with great correctness, the relation of Tauism to
Buddhism. Buddhism has borrowed nothing from Tauism, while Tauism has
borrowed much from Buddhism.

After his description of Chinese Buddhism, Schott has added a
translation of a work of the school of the *Tsing-tu* or "Peaceful
land." This work is also illustrated fully with notes by the translator.
It is a well-selected example of current Buddhist teaching in China.

The reader of the *Tsing-tu-wen* (that is the name of the book
translated) is informed by the native author, that he is not to expect
advantage only in the future life from his study of the books of the
school of the Peaceful land. They are adapted to benefit him in the
present life by transforming him into what the book represents as a good
Buddhist.

The late learned archimandrite Palladius, resident for many years in
Peking as a member of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission, was a profound
student of Chinese Buddhism. The result of his very extensive reading
was embodied in two papers printed in the "Researches of the Members of
the Russian Mission in Peking." One is a "Life of Buddha;" the other
describes the subsequent philosophical development of Buddhism. These
"Researches" have been translated into German.

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

The *Hand-book for the Student of Chinese Buddhism*, by Dr. E. J.
Eitel, <span id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_146.md) is a dictionary of proper
names, dogmas, and Buddhist terms generally, arranged alphabetically.
The student of Buddhism obtains in this work an important help to his
studies. The author has devoted great attention to this subject, and
has, in addition to his own investigations, here placed within reach of
his readers, many contributions from the immense learning in this
department, of Julien, Burnouf, and Koeppen.

Buddhism is not so powerful in China as to cause alarm to the Christian
missionary, in view of the coming struggle which he anticipates. But the
history of its introduction, and the nature and extent of the influence
it has produced on the Chinese mind and literature, are extremely
interesting subjects. The Hindoo missionaries tried hard to bring the
Chinese to accept the mythology and religious doctrines of their country
at the time when it was Buddhist. Their translations abound in Sanscrit
words, which it was hoped the Chinese would learn, but this they failed
to do. Names of things as well as names of persons, words expressive of
doctrines, abstract names, classes of mythological beings, adjectives,
arithmetical and astronomical expressions, and many long compound terms
are imported in full into the Chinese text. To explain them glossaries
were prepared. But they expected more zeal and perseverance in their
Chinese neophytes than they have shown, and the consequence is that the
glossaries are not looked at, and the Sanscrit names are passed over by
the reader of the Chinese texts as an abracadabra which he is glad to
miss.

Buddha's heart is, for example, spoken of as *Anuttara samyak sambôdhi*,
pronounced in the era of the Hindoo translations, *A-no-ta-la sam-mo
sam-bo-di*. *An* is the negative, *uttara* is "superior;" *sam* means
"perfect," "good," "same;" *samyak* is given in the Sanscrit dictionary,
"all," "wholly," "fitly." *Bôdhi* is "intelligence,"

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "the intellect,"
"the holy fig-tree," "knowledge of God," and as an adjective, "wise;"
etymologically it is "that which distinguishes;" that is, "the
intellect," and hence "that which is distinguished," "doctrine," "the
object of the highest study." From this has come the title Buddha the
"perceiver," "the sage."

Whoever will study Buddhism, must know what these and other such words
mean; and Dr. Eitel's object has been to provide a handbook in which a
mass of information has been collected, adapted to aid the inquirer. In
this instance he must look under the words *Anuttara* and *Bôdhi*. If he
is reading a Chinese Buddhist production, he must first consult the
Chinese index at the end of the volume. This mode of using the
*Sanscrit-Chinese Dictionary* is a little cumbrous, but perhaps it is
preferable to the perpetuation in a work of this kind of the Mandarin
pronunciation, as given in Morrison, Wade, and other authors. Sanscrit
books having been translated fourteen centuries ago, the powers of the
Chinese characters which represented Hindoo words have changed in the
meantime. As Dr. Eitel justly remarks: "To the language then spoken in
China no modern Chinese dialect comes nearer in sound than the very
Sanskrit or Pali forms themselves."

The difficulty might be met, if we had a dictionary of Chinese words
with the ancient and modern pronunciations arranged in succession, as in
K‘ang-hi, but in a more complete form than in that work. For example, if
in Morrison's *Syllabic Dictionary*, under the syllable *Fuh*, between
the character and the meanings were inserted "old sound, *But;* Amoy,
*Put;* Nanking, *Fuh;* Peking, *Fo;*" every one would thus be in a
position to know what the old sounds of the characters are. It would
then be feasible to compile a Chinese-Sanscrit, instead of a
Sanscrit-Chinese, dictionary.

But as the student of Chinese must also learn to consult works arranged
according to the radicals, like Kang-hi

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

itself, Dr. Eitel's arrangement of the dictionary forms no bar to its
usefulness.

Among the longer and more valuable articles in this work are those on
*Kwan-yin* or "Avalakitês‘vara," *Buddha* or "S‘âkyamuni," "Samâdhi,"
"Sanskrita," "Nâga," "Mañdjus‘rî," "Amitâbha," "Dhyâna," "Nâgârdjuna,"
"Naraka," "Triratna," "Nirvâna," and "Trikâya." The spelling here given
is that of an author who, somewhat oddly, has followed the French
orthography in writing the Sanscrit sounds *ch*, *sh*, and *j*.

The best key to the understanding of Buddhism is to be found in the
study of the life of its founder. In Shakyamuni himself humanity is
first seen, then divinity. A young prince, handsome, strong, heroic,
surrounded by pleasures, and tempted by the most brilliant worldly
prospects, is deeply affected by observing the miseries of human life.
He becomes a changed man, forsakes his father's palace for a hermit's
cell, practises and then teaches a rigid asceticism, and dies at eighty,
after a long career occupied partly with the instruction of a numerous
band of disciples, and partly with extatic contemplation. He is deified
at the moment of death; that is, his disciples elevate him to the summit
of humanity, honour him as the best of teachers, and announce that he is
for ever rescued from the revolutions of life and death. He has entered
the Nirvâna, and when his body has been burned, the *sharira*, or small
reddish residuum, is honoured as a sacred relic possessing marvellous
powers, and over it a pagoda must be erected.

Such a phenomenon—a great and disinterested mind, founding the monastic
institute, and teaching multitudes of both sexes and every caste the
escape from sorrow to the eternal rest of the Nirvâna—was sufficient in
the condition of Hindoo society, as it was two centuries before the
expedition of Alexander, to account for the early history of Buddhism.
In his account of *Kwan-yin* (Avalôkitêsh‘vara) our author has gone too
far, when he

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

supposes there was a Chinese divinity of this name before the
introduction of the Mahayana into China. Nothing is easier than to
attach to the imaginary former lives of the great Bodhisattwas, any
incidents of old biography in any age or country, of a marvellous kind,
and adapted to be, in the Buddhist sense, edifying. Such incidents were
ascribed by the Chinese Buddhists to the presence of Kwan-yin, nearly as
in the Earl of Beaconsfield's *Lothair* the opportune arrival of a Roman
shopkeeper's wife, who shows a benevolent interest in the welfare of
that hero, is believed by the pope and his cardinal to be an appearance
of the Virgin Mary. Hence the author of that romance sarcastically
describes Lothair as being for a time, in the opinion of every one in
Rome, high and low, "the most favoured man in this century;" yet the net
failed to entrap him through his want of faith.

Kwan-yin "looks on" (*kwan*) "the region" (*shi*) of sufferers whose
"voices" (*yin*) of many tones, all acknowledging misery and asking
salvation, touch the heart or the pitiful Bodhisattwa. She looks with a
thousand eyes that she may see them all, and stretches out a thousand
arms that she may save them all.

Kumarajiva himself adopted the name *Kwan-shï-yin*. The translators of
the T‘ang period, two centuries later, brought to view the true
etymology as given by our author, but they did not succeed in changing
the course of the legend or the name of the divinity. Kumarajiva
preferred the more popular and edifying designation. The two meanings,
Kwan-tsï-tsai and Kwan-shi-yin, doubtless existed together in
Kumarajiva's country, Cashmere, just as afterwards in China. The
Mahayana doctrine had prevailed there already for nearly two hundred
years, from the time of Nagarjuna, given in the *Hand-book*, A.D. 194

The remarkable extension of the Mahayana literature (*Hwa-yen-king*,
*Fa-hwa-king*, &c.) in Cashmere, Kashgar, Balkh, and what is now Cabul,
aided by the conversion

<span id="page_416">p. 416</span>

to Buddhism of the Indian Getæ, the *Yue-ti* of Chinese history, renders
the dialects there spoken early in the Christian era important for the
determination of the language employed by the first Hindoo missionaries
in China.

Our author says the Pali was first used, and afterwards the Sanscrit. It
would be more correct to say that the Magadha dialect was first used,
then the dialect of Northern India, such as was spoken in Cashmere, and
afterwards the Sanscrit. In the Han dynasty, under Ming-ti,
Kashiapmadanga, who came from Magadha, the modern Bahar, used the
dialect of that country, which differed from the Pali among other things
in retaining from Sanscrit the letter *sh*. <span
id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_147.md) If Kashiapmadanga, the most ancient of
the translators, had chosen Chinese words whose initial was *s* to write
the Sanscrit *Shramana* and *Kashiapa*, it might be said that he used
the Pali. <span id="fr_148"></span>[2](#fn_148.md) In the "Sutra of
Forty-two Sections" he used *Sha-men*, and thus originated that name, to
be used ever after as the designation of the members of the Buddhist
community in China. For Kashiapa he wrote *Ka-shiap*.

The second era of translators, A.D. 400, was that of Kumarajiva of
Cashmere. There can be no doubt that he made use of *sh* and *s* as
separate letters, for he never confounds them in his choice of Chinese
characters. The Chinese words already introduced by his predecessors he
did not alter, and in introducing new terms required in the translation
of the *Mahayana* literature (*Ta-ch‘eng*), or "Greater Development," he
uses *sh* for *sh*, and usually *b* for *v*. Thus the city "Shravasti"
was in Pali *Savatthi*, and in Chinese *Sha-ba-ti*. Probably Kumarajiva
himself, speaking in the Cashmere dialect of Sanscrit, called it
*Shabati*.

Two centuries later, the fashion of close adherence to Sanscrit came
into use under the leadership of Hiuen-tsang.

<span id="page_417">p. 417</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> For example,
instead of *Bi-k‘u*, which is like the Pali Bhikkhu (probably also found
in the Magadha language), *Bit-ch‘u*, was written, evidently with the
intention of restoring the Sanscrit *sh*. Our author gives a different
reason.

The great value of such a guide as this *Hand-book* in the study of
Chinese Buddhism will be understood by the student, when he finds that
almost all the important words in doctrine and biography are here traced
to their Sanscrit originals, and explained with the aid of recent
European criticism. Thus *Ho-shang*, the most popular term for "Priest,"
is *Upadhyâya*, the president of an "assembly," or *sangha*. The "Three
Precious Ones" are *Buddha*, the personal teacher; *Dharma*, the Law or
body of doctrine; and *Sangha*, the Priesthood. The term *sam-mei* is
explained as the "samâdhi" of the original Sanscrit. "Samâdhi signifies
the highest pitch of abstract ecstatic meditation, a state of absolute
indifference to all influences from within or without, a state of torpor
of both the material and spiritual forces of vitality, a sort of
terrestrial Nirvâna consistently culminating in total destruction of
life. 'He consumed his body by Agni (the fire of) Samâdhi' is a common
phrase."

The expression *Tau-pi-an*, "Arrival at that shore," is explained as the
Chinese equivalent of *Paramita*, embracing the six means of passing to
the Nirvâna. These are—1. "Charity" (or giving), *Dâna;* 2. "Morality,"
*Shîla* (good conduct); 3. "Patience," *Kshânti;* 4. "Energy," *Virya;*
5. "Contemplation," *Dhyâna;* 6. "Wisdom," *Prajna*.

In the account of Nirvâna, Dr. Eitel touches on a subject of great
interest, namely, the expectation of immortality asserting itself in
Buddhism, in spite of the overwhelming influence of a metaphysical
system adverse alike to the belief in God and to that in immortality.
Shakyamuni said in his last moments, "The spiritual body is immortal."
But he said just before, "All you Bikshus, do

<span id="page_418">p. 418</span>

not be sad. If I lived in the world for a *kalpa*, on arriving at the
time I must still be annihilated. Not to leave you when the hour has
arrived is impossible. In gaining benefit one's-self, others are
benefited. The system of doctrine is already perfect. Should I live
longer, it would be of no benefit to you. All that were to be saved,
whether in the paradises of the Devas, or in the world of mankind, have
already been saved. As to those who have not been saved, the causes
which will ultimately lead to their salvation have already been put in
operation. From this time forward I exhort you, my disciples, to expand,
explain, and propagate my doctrine, and thus" (here follows our author's
quotation) "the 'spiritual body' (*fa-shen*) of Ju-lai will be
constantly present, and will not be annihilated at all."

Much cannot be built on this passage from the "Sutra of the dying
instructions of Buddha," but Dr. Eitel is quite right in arguing the
continued existence of the Buddhas from their occasional reappearance
after death for the salvation of living beings, and also from the dogma
of the "Western Paradise."

Why, in his article on Dhyâna, the author has omitted any reference to
the *Ch‘an-men* does not appear. He has, however, given an account of
the twenty-eight patriarchs, the last of whom, Bodhidharma, introduced
into China the Buddhist sect called the *Ch‘an-men*, which has played in
some respects the same part in China that the *Jainas* did in India. It
has almost supplanted the original Buddhism, and has always made much of
the esoteric deposit of doctrine and its transmission along with the
robe and rice bowl from patriarch to patriarch. The meaning of the
names, however, differs. *Jaina* means "the conqueror," while *dhyâna*,
the Indian prototype of the Chinese *dan*, later *ch‘an*, signifies
"meditation."

In the notice of the *nagas* there are some interesting references to
"serpent" worship, that very widespread

<span id="page_419">p. 419</span>

and ancient superstition, which seems to have originated in the first
ages, and to have spread from the Babylonian region to the most widely
separated countries. The stones of Avebury in Wiltshire, not far from
Stonehenge, retain the serpentine shape in which the Druids, or the
predecessors of the Druids, arranged them. The Hebrew *nahash*, Gaelic
*narar*, and English "snake," are word-forms which preserve the old
idea; and the account of the temptation in Genesis furnishes us with a
probable origin for the traditions of serpent worship among various
nations.

In Eastern Asia the *nagas* were looked on as well disposed. Hence the
Birmese confound them with the *devans*, while the Chinese regard them
as good and powerful and call them *lung*, the Greek *drakōn*, and the
German *schlange*.

On the six paths of transmigration the reader will find information
under the heads *Gâti*, *Prêtas*, *Asura*, *Amôgha*, &c.

But it is time to stop. Buddhism is a subject which easily ramifies into
so many directions, that it is necessary to limit these remarks.

Mr. Watters' papers on *Chinese Buddhism* have been already referred to,
in the sketch of the history of Chinese Buddhism in an early part of
this volume. They contain a historical summary of Chinese Buddhism, an
account of the Buddhas, and a sketch of the Confucianist opposition.

Dr. Eitel's valuable *Three Lectures on Buddhism*, and an article by him
on the "Nirvâna of Chinese Buddhism," in the *Chinese Recorder*, June
1870, should be consulted by the student.

In "Buddhism in China," by Rev. S. Beal, the reader will find much to
interest. Mr. Beal believed in the Persian influence which produced the
legend of Amitabha, and in the Sabean origin of Sukhavati (Socotra), the
island of the blessed. In this he is right.

The works of Sir Monier Williams and Dr. Rhys Davids on Buddhism
generally are the productions of writers of

<span id="page_420">p. 420</span>

great erudition and long experience. They naturally throw valuable light
on Chinese Buddhism from the Indian side. Sir Edwin Arnold's "Light of
Asia" is a charming poem, which has made Buddhist thought familiar to
many readers who knew nothing of it before. Some works from Pali have
been translated in the "Sacred Books of the East." Such is the number of
new publications on the subject of Buddhism, that it is evident the
reader has it in his power to obtain a thorough knowledge of this
religion. He can test for himself how far it softens manners and teaches
kindness, encourages faith in the supernatural, and testifies to the
vanity of the world; at the same time he will learn that for the
revelation of moral evil and its remedy, of God and of immortality,
Buddhism makes no effort that can for a moment compare with the work
which Christianity has done for mankind.
