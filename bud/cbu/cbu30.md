### CHAPTER XXV.

#### ON THE USE OF SANSCRIT BY THE CHINESE BUDDHISTS.

<span class="small">Changes in Chinese sounds since the time of the

THE Chinese characters have been written in the same form and with the
same sort of pencils since the time of Wang Hi-chi, A.D. 350.

During these fifteen centuries, while the writing taught in all schools
has been unchanged, the sounds attached to the characters have been in a
state of slow and constant flux.

Thus, the translator Kumarajiva wrote his name with four Chinese
characters then called *Ku-ma-la-zhip*. They are now *Kieu*- (or
*Chieu*) *mo-lo-shï*.

All sonant initials, such as *g*, *d*, *b*, *z*, *zh*, *j*, have changed
in the interval to surds, viz., *k*, *t*, *p*, *s*, *sh*, *ch*. In words
pronounced with the tone called *hia-ping*, the aspirates *k’*, *t’*,
*p’*, *ch’* come in place of *k*, *t*, *p*, *ch*, which occur in words
pronounced with the tones *hia-ping*, *hia-ch‘ü*, and *hia-ju*.

Final *m* has changed to final *n*. Finals *k*, *t*, *p* have been
dropped; also the vowels have all changed their values, *a* to *o*, *ya*
to *e*, *u* to *yeu*, &c.

The compilers of Kang-hi's dictionary have provided tables of the old
sounds, with characters chosen to represent

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

the pronunciation as it formerly was. They are to be read with the
powers of the letters of the Sanscrit alphabet. Natives not knowing the
Sanscrit letters cannot escape from the confusion in which they are
involved by the difference between the old and new pronunciations. The
foreign student will find that the principle here laid down is a key to
unlock the difficulties of the subject.

The following examples will help to familiarise the learner with the
method:—

The admission of the principle that the Chinese pronunciation has
changed, and that the recognised Mandarin orthography is nothing more
than that of a modern dialect, will be found to throw a light much
needed on the use of Sanscrit by the Chinese Buddhists.

It is also necessary to recognise the principle, that the Hindoo
Buddhists in China were men who spoke the dialects of Central India,
Northern India, &c.

<span id="page_400">p. 400</span>

M. Stanislas Julien's *Méthode pour Déchifrer et Transcrire les noms
Sanscrits* makes no allusion to these subjects. The consequence is that
all his immense industry has failed to make a window that would have
illuminated this dark room. Yet that does not hinder his work from being
indispensable to the student on this subject. It gives the Sanscrit
words. It gives the modern Chinese pronunciation. These two factors are
tabulated alphabetically. The student can with this help proceed
rapidly. But if he wish to understand why such and such Chinese
characters were chosen, and not prosecute his researches mechanically,
he must allow for the influence of dialects and the incessant change of
language on both sides of the Himalayas.

It is necessary to take the finals of the Southern Chinese dialects, and
the initials of the dialects spoken in Central China at the present
time, as our sign-posts, pointing out to us what was the pronunciation
of the T‘ang dynasty and of the previous age; and this must be done with
the addition of aid from the Japanese and Corean transliteration of
Chinese sounds, through the spread of Buddhism many centuries ago.

It was about three hundred and forty years after the death of Mencius,
and five hundred and fifty after the death of Confucius, that the
translations from Sanscrit were made. By learning the powers of the
Chinese syllabary with the help of the transliterations then made, we
can come quite near to the classical age of Chinese literature, and
approximate to the actual pronunciation of the great Chinese sages. For
the method and proofs, I may here refer the reader to my *Introduction
to the Study of the Chinese Characters*.

Particularly is the "Sutra of Forty-two Sections" worthy of attention,
on account of its being the translation of Kashiapmadanga and his friend
Chu-fa-lan. It is highly important for fixing the pronunciation of the
Chinese, at the time when they taught Buddhism at Lo-yang, in the reign
of Ming-ti, A.D. 58 to A.D. 76. From their use of

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

characters it is clear, that at that time the modern *Fo* was *But;*
*O-lo-han* was *A-la-han;* *ch‘an*, "contemplation," was *dian* or
*dan;* *Nie-p‘an*, "Nirvâna," was *Nit-ban* or *Nir-ban;* *Kia-she*, the
name of "Kashiapa" Buddha, was *Ka-shap* or *Ka-shiap;* *P‘u-t‘i*, the
word *Bodhi*, "knowledge," was *Bo-di*. *Sha-men*, the "Shramana," was
*Sha-men*, having about the same sound as now. *Pi-k‘ieu* or
*Pi-ch‘ieu*, the "Bikshu," was *Bi-k‘u*. *Ch‘iau-ch‘en-ju*, for
"Godinia," was *Go-din-nia*. *O-na-han*, a certain grade in
discipleship, was *A-na-gam*, agreeing with the Sanscrit "Anagama."
*Pi-chï*, for the Sanscrit "Pratyeka," was *P‘ak-tie*, the Pali being
*Patiekan*. So it was probably not Pali that Kashiapmadanga spoke,
though he was a native of Central India. *Sü-t‘o-hwan*, for
"Srotapanna," another grade of discipleship, was *So-da-ban* or
*Su-da-wan*. The last of these is the more likely, for the character is
the same as that used in writing "Nirvâna." The Pali is *Sotapan;* so
that the translator did not speak Pali.

The greatest initiator of change in the choice of characters was
Hiuen-tsang, about A.D. 645. He altered the characters according to his
opinion of what the selected symbols ought to be. His selection of
characters is a gauge of the pronunciation of his time. His
translations, however, have not become popular. The older usage of words
has kept its place.

The language in which the Buddhist sacred writings were first compiled
may have been Pali; but that from which they were translated into
Chinese was Sanscrit. The Pali books were a separate set of originals.
The Sanscrit originals alone are known to the Chinese. The manuscripts,
the inscriptions, the charms cut on copper mirrors, the lucky sentences
under eaves and over doors in monasteries, are in Sanscrit; and in
polyglot books printed at Peking, Sanscrit is the language employed.

Koeppen, page 186, in saying that the Chinese also have a number of Pali
texts, has been misled by Gutzlaff.

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This missionary
had lived in Siam, where Pali is the sacred language, and was there
accustomed to the idea that Pali was the original language of Buddhism.
This view he brought with him to China, and when he saw Sanscrit
inscriptions in the island of P‘u-to, he took them to be Pali. From him
the opinion spread, but it is an error. The Buddhists of Birmah, Siam,
and Ceylon have never spread their religion in China or Japan, or
introduced their sacred books into those countries.

The Nepaul Buddhists preserve the sacred books in Sanscrit, and not in
Pali. But Burnouf also found certain portions of the Nepaulese books
written in Pracrit. The groundwork was Sanscrit. The language
occasionally used was Pracrit. The language known by the Chinese as the
*Fan* language was shown to be undoubtedly Sanscrit, by Julien's version
of the works of Hiuen-tsang, the traveller who visited India, and who
has described the Sanscrit language in his autobiography. It is the
language of "Brahma" (*Fan;* old sound, *Bam*).

Brahmanical ideas form a strong element in Buddhism. Sanscrit words and
Sanscrit writing are peculiarly sacred in the view of the Brahmans. This
idea has been borrowed by the Buddhists. They preferred to use the words
and writing which were most sacred. With this Shakyamuni would naturally
have nothing to do. His instructions were oral. He was a great moral
teacher and metaphysical logician. It was his disciples in the centuries
that followed him that introduced Sanscrit writing, as the chief medium
of recording his instructions. It is they that are responsible also for
the charms, and for the faith in magic which stimulated their use.

So many Brahmans announced themselves believers in Shakyamuni's
doctrines, that Sanscrit became at once a favourite medium for the
embodiment of his teaching by writing, even though Shakyamuni himself
spoke Pali or Pracrit, as he probably did.

In the same way it may be said that Pali was then so

<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>

extensively spoken, that it was inevitable that it should, in the region
watered by the Lower Ganges, become also a medium for the preservation
of the sacred books.

This double form of the sacred books had much to do with the separation
that sprang up between the Northern and Southern schools of Buddhism.
The peculiarities of the Chinese transcription deserve to be considered.

The Pracrit of the early Chinese translators was, for example, nearer to
Sanscrit than to Pali in the sound of *prajna*, "wisdom." The characters
adopted are directed to be pronounced *pat-nia.* The Pali is *paññya*.

There was also in the Pracrit of the early Chinese translators a very
clear pronunciation of *b* for the Sanscrit and Pali *v*. This is shown
by the constant selection of Chinese characters sounded with *b* or *p*,
according to the old pronunciation. For example, the city "Vaishali,"
near the modern Patna, is spelt *Bai-sha-li*. The Pali sound is
*Vesali*. Dr. E. J. Eitel, in his *Hand-book of Chinese Buddhism*, page
27, has said, that "Chinese texts consider Pali as the ancient and
Sanskrit as the modern form even as regards the system of sounds." If he
will direct his attention to these facts, he will perhaps admit that not
the Pali, but a certain Pracrit form or forms of the Hindoo language,
prevalent at the time in Central and Northern India, was or were at the
basis of the Chinese old texts, The Hindoo translators in China would
have Sanscrit texts chiefly before them, and Pracrit texts occasionally.
Their pronunciation was not pure Sanscrit, but was modified by Pracrit
peculiarities.

In the flourishing period of Buddhism, in the region watered by the
Ganges, at the time of the Greek invasion, and afterwards, the art of
writing lately introduced was put to extensive use in the Buddhist
monasteries. Those institutions fostered education, which was then very
much in Buddhist hands. While the people spoke Pali and Pracrit,
Sanscrit was the language of education, and hence the fondness shown for
it by the Buddhists.

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

Burnouf held that there was a double text, a Pracrit text for the laity
and a Sanscrit for the literati.

King Kanishka in Cashmere called a council, the fourth; and in the
writings edited by this assembly, Sanscrit was the language.

The language of Magadha in the time of the emperor Ashôka was a Pracrit.
This was probably much used by the Hindoo Buddhists who came to China.

An argument against Pali is to be found in the careful selection of
Chinese words commencing with *sh*, to represent the Sanscrit *sh;* but
*sh* is not a letter known to the Pali, just as it was wanting in the
ancient Greek and Latin. The original text of the early Chinese
translations before the days of Hiuen-tsang must have had *sh* fully
developed. It probably dropped *ra* in *sharira*, "a relic," and *sti*
in *Shravasti*, name of the capital of an ancient kingdom called Kosala,
and lying near Kapilavastu.

I place here some remarks on *po-li*, "glass," a favourite word. In
Buddhist glossaries, the Chinese *po-li* is derived from the Sanscrit
word *spatika*, "crystal." Many of the Hindoo Buddhists who came to
China—perhaps all—spoke dialects of Sanscrit, but not the Sanscrit
itself. The *s* was dropped, and the final *ka*. The *t* in *ti* became
*l*, as in the Turkish *belur*.

The rock crystal of China comes from Turkestan, and would bring its own
name with it from that country. Buddhist makers of glossaries would
prefer to derive the word from Sanscrit, as the mother of all knowledge.
They have passed over without remark the possibility that the Chinese
word may come from the Turkish.

The word *po-li* for "glass," formerly pronounced *pa-li*, has been in
common use in China since the T‘ang dynasty. It came in with Buddhism
and the international trade with Turkestan.

I believe that the initial *s* in *spatika* might be an accretion and
not original, just as most probably *smelt* is later than *melt*, and
*sneeze* than *nose*, and *stannum* than *tin*.

<span id="page_405">p. 405</span>

Curiously we find in the Mongol vocabulary *bolor*, "crystal," "glass;"
*bolor daboso*, "rock salt;" *bolo ch‘ilagon*, "a polishing stone," a
rolling stone used in smoothing the clods of a ploughed field. Compare
Turkish *bileghi*, "whetstone." Let it be noticed that glass-dust is
used by polishers and grinders.

Whether the *bôli* or *bali* is of Turanian origin and has originated
the Sanscrit *spatika*, it would be interesting to know. *Ballur* is
Arabic for "crystal;" *spashta* is Sanscrit for "clear;" *berrak* is
Turkish for "clear," "limpid." Probably here is the root; but who shall
decide?

In Buddhist magic there has been extensive use of the Sanscrit
characters. The doctrine of magic has been developed by the Buddhists
very systematically, and to an almost unexampled extent. It arose from
the same tendency in the Hindoo mind, which produced those vast fictions
in the description of the universe, and in the narrative of the past,
that distinguish the native literature of that country. The love of the
wonderful led the Hindoo authors to forsake, at the same time, the fair
bounds of history and the sober reality of nature. Here it is easy to
perceive a similarity to the Arabians. There is, in their fictions, the
same fondness for splendid scenes and striking supernatural effects.
This would be poetry were it not very much overdone. The same
circumstances of gaudy magnificence are again and again repeated, and
the reader is wearied with the unending recital of marvellous events,
invented after one model, and whose one object is to excite an
undistinguishing admiration of the power displayed.

By magic is here meant the supernatural power attributed to the Buddhas
and Bodhisattwas, or claimed by the ordinary priests, and which is
exercised by charms, mystic formulæ, incantations, finger-postures, and
such-like means.

It is not the power of God acting through nature that is here intended,
but the power of the priest, through his charms, virtues, and superior
knowledge. The magical result is effected by the never-erring
retributive fate which

<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>

is the cause of everything that occurs, and which is responsive in the
most complete manner to Buddhist wisdom and goodness.

The use of the Devanagari writing for the purposes of magic is an
instructive instance of the power of superstition to delude the human
mind. The words used by the magician for the most part have no meaning.
They are senseless clatter. The sounds are Sanscrit, but the words
usually not so. These absurd compositions of unmeaning sounds are of
various lengths. They occur frequently in the books of the Great
Development. They are engraved on stone monuments on the way side, on
imperial roads, and at places of resort for Buddhist pilgrims. They also
form a chief part of the liturgies in use in the monasteries and at
funerals.

*Om-mani-padme-hum* is one of the most common. *Padme* is "lotus;"
*mani* is a "precious stone;" *om* is a sacred "Hindoo symbol." It is
written in Sanscrit characters under the eaves of all the lama temples
in Peking. In these temples it meets the eye everywhere.

The Thibetan character is based on the Sanscrit. It is also found cut on
monuments, both for charms and for intelligible inscriptions. It is the
chief language for liturgical use among the Thibetans and Mongol lamas
in Peking, except in two instances. In the Mahakala *miau*, the Mongol
sacred books are read. In a temple, Fa-hai sï, near the hunting park,
the Manchu is read. The Chinese lamas in Peking read Thibetan prayers,
while the Chinese priests of the old Chinese Buddhism read, of course,
in Chinese.

In all these forms, the syllables of the charms are the same. They are
written in Sanscrit, or in the other languages mentioned.

At the pass called Kü-yung kwan, near Peking, there is a stone monument
containing a charm in six languages, viz., Sanscrit, Chinese, Thibetan,
Nü-chih, Ouighour, and Mongol. It was cut in the time of the Mongol
emperors.

<span id="page_407">p. 407</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It contains the
same charm written with the characters employed for all these languages.
It was intended as a protection to the emperor in going to and coming
from the summer palace, at that time beyond Tu-shï k‘eu, and also to all
travellers on this much frequented road between China and Mongolia.

There are also some monuments inscribed with Sanscrit charms in Peking
at the present time, which date from about seven hundred years ago. They
are stone octagonal pillars. One is at the monastery called Hwa-yen sï,
near the park of the Altar of Heaven and the city gate known as
Kiang-cha men. These octagonal pillars are called *shï-chwang*, and they
are placed in the courts of temples. There is one kept on the premises
of the London Missionary Society in Peking.

Sanscrit inscriptions are supposed, like pagodas and monasteries, to
have a lucky effect on the neighbourhood where they are found, and on
those who erect them by their benefactions and goodwill.

A muttered charm is called "dharani," or, in Chinese, *cheu*.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[399:1](cbu30.htm#fr_140.md) S. Julien is wrong in
making the first of these four characters end in *n*. It is *pat* in old
Chinese; but *pat* was often *par*. See p. 201 of my *Introduction to
the Study of the Chinese Characters*. Thus the famous word *karma*,
"cause," "fate," was transliterated *kat-ma*, the *t* being heard as
*r*.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[399:2](cbu30.htm#fr_141.md) The character *de*
should be transliterated *dek*. That the *k* was then lost is shown by
its use in this case. The loss of *k* final was beginning.
