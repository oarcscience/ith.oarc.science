### CHAPTER XV.

#### MONASTERIES AT P‘U-TO.

<span class="small">This establishment more modern than T‘ien-t‘ai and
Wu-t‘ai—Many Thibetan inscriptions—Frequent visits of Peking
lamas—Dedicated to Kwan-yin—Gifts by
K‘ang-hi—Images—Caves—Pagodas—Inscriptions—Resident defenders of
Buddhism—The Potala of Jehol in Mongolia—It is also the name of the
palace—Temple of the Dalai Lama—In China an island was preferred to be
the *tau-ch‘ang* of Kwan-yin.</span>

THIS island has long been known to foreigners as a celebrated spot, to
which multitudes of zealous Buddhists make pilgrimages. It has of late
years been a favourite summer residence of foreigners, and has been
frequently described in recent books on China, so that its natural
features need not be here repeated.

The peculiarities of the monasteries, however, need some remarks, for
travellers have hitherto said nothing to explain them. Their interest is
modern compared with that of some other celebrated seats of the Buddhist
religion. For antiquities they cannot vie with T‘ien-t‘ai, or with
Wu-t‘ai shan in Shan-si. They are remarkable rather as forming a
connecting link with the lama Buddhism of Thibet and Mongolia. This
connection is seen in several circumstances. Kwan-yin is the patron
deity of Thibet and also of P‘u-to, leading to a peculiar arrangement of
the images in the monasteries, and the substitution of this deity for
Shakyamuni Buddha in the centre of the great hall. Lama priests at
Peking have always been accustomed to visit the island, and perform
worship

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

there till recently, of which Thibetan inscriptions still on the island
are monuments. The monastic establishments now on the island date
principally from the Mongolian dynasty in the fourteenth century, and
the Manchu emperors have, from motives of policy, always shown favour to
the national religion of their Western tributaries.

Yet the regulations of the monasteries are all Chinese, and the schools
to which the monks belong are those which have sprung up in China
itself. One establishment belongs to the Lin-tsi school, and the other
to that of Ts‘au-tung. The following is the mode of teaching in these
schools. The instructor utters a few sentences to his pupils adapted to
enlighten them on some point considered of importance. The pupils in the
Tsung-men division of Chinese Buddhism, to which both these schools
belong, depend not on books or on a regular course of study, but simply
on the living teacher. The founder of the Lin-tsi once said, in answer
to a disciple's questions, "What is really Buddha? What is *dharma* (the
law)? What is religious progress?"—"That the heart be pure and calm, is
Buddha. That the mind be clear and bright, is *dharma*. That hindrances
in all directions be removed, and the mind calm and bright, is
'religious progress' (*tau*)." There appear to be more monasteries now
belonging to this school than to any other.

The visitor to the Buddhist sacred island will notice the green and
yellow tiling of the two large monasteries. The same material was
employed in the Nanking porcelain tower now destroyed, and is found in
the monasteries of the lamas in Peking. This glazed pottery is of the
five colours at Nanking, viz., blue, yellow, red, black, and white. Here
it is only green and yellow. It is called *lieu-li-wa*. *Lieu-li* is a
word introduced to China, like *po-li* "glass," by the Buddhists. It is
one of the Eight precious things, and is called at full length in
Sanscrit *Vaiduria*. This name appears to be given by the Hindoos to a
natural and an artificial substance (as in the case also of "sp‘atika"
or *po-li*, "glass").

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

The buildings are on a large scale. Thus the great hall of Kwan-yin, in
the first monastery, is fifty yards long and thirty wide.

Both the large monasteries are dedicated to Kwan-yin p‘u-sa, instead of
to Shakyamuni Buddha. In other monasteries the central position and the
most monstrous image are always assigned to Shakya, the Buddha reigning
in the present *kalpa*, and the teacher to whom every monk unites
himself when he takes the vows. Here, however, Kwan-yin presides, and is
therefore called *Chu Fo*, "the Ruling Buddha," of the monasteries and
of the island.

Instead of the usual name *Ta-hiung-pau-tien*, "The precious hall of the
great hero," alluding to Shakyamuni, we have the *Ta-yuen-t’ung-tien*,
"The hall of the complete and correct doctrine," referring to Kwan-yin.

In this hall is a large image of earthenware with pedestal and canopy,
all brought from Thibet, by order of the emperor K‘ang-hi, and presented
to each of the monasteries. The figure is gilt, and is that of a female
sitting cross-legged in the Buddhist manner. There is no dress on it
except rings on the arms, a few lotus leaves, and the usual crown of the
Bodhisattwas. In one of the monasteries, a yellow silk cloak is thrown
over the image. Round the canopy, which is of wood, are figures of
Bodhisattwas, and on the pedestal several white elephants and lions
carved in wood, which are also foreign.

Behind the Thibetan image is a monstrous male Kwan-yin, with the P‘i-lu
crown, representing the ruler of the monastery. Over his head is a large
circle, on which nine dragons twine themselves. From them the hall is
also sometimes called *Kieu-lung-tien*. Above, on a tablet, is a
sentence given by K‘ang-hi, *P‘u-tsi-k‘iün-ling*, "The universal saviour
of all living beings." This is said in praise of Kwan-yin.

On the left of this image is a figure of wood, representing Amitabha,
the fictitious Buddha of the Western heaven, whose name is constantly on
the lips of the Chinese

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

and Thibetan priests, and is seen everywhere painted on walls and carved
on stone. Kwan-yin plays a principal part in the legend of the "Peaceful
land" or *Tsing-tu*, "The Western heaven," and is one of the "three
sages" (*san-sheng*) supposed to reside there, the other two being
*Ta-shï-chï p‘u-sa* and Amitabha.

On the right is another Kwan-yin, called *Kwo-hai* Kwan-yin, alluding to
a "passage across the sea" of this deity to the island Putaloka, the
Indian archetype of *P‘u-to* itself. Along the east and west walls of
the hall are ranged thirty-two images, representing the metamorphoses of
Kwan-yin. They are called *Kwan-yin san-shï-rï-siang;* they are all
male, and are individualised by varieties in posture, dress, and
head-coverings.

The name Kwan-tsï-tsai is used in some of the inscriptions for
Kwan-shï-yin. This is a new name introduced by Hiuen-tsang the
traveller, from the Sanscrit Avalôkitêshwara, in place of the older one
translated by Kumarajiva from the shorter Hindoo name Avalokite.

There are other representations of this deity. The Eight-faced Kwan-yin,
the Thousand-handed Kwan-yin, and "The giver of sons" are found here,
and commonly in Buddhist temples. The last of these,
*Sung-tsï*-Kwan-yin, is a female figure.

Before the principal idol is a stand for an incense urn, &c. It is
called *Wu-shï-hiang-pau*, "The five-vessel-incense stand." The five
vessels are—an incense urn in the middle, two candle supporters, and two
urns for flowers.

The same five vessels are also placed on the pavement in front of the
hall. Artificial flowers only are used.

There is much similarity in the arrangements of the two monasteries.
Both have two imperial tablets with halls specially erected for their
reception. When these buildings are injured by time, it is not permitted
to repair them without an order from the emperor. Hence some of them
have become much dilapidated. Lamas used to be sent every year from
Peking to the island, to worship Kwan-yin

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

in the emperor's name, and investigate the condition of the monasteries.
None, however, have gone there during the last forty years. The two
Thibetan inscriptions on the road side leading to the first monastery
were made by these lamas. The older one dates from the time of
Kia-k‘ing, A.D. 1796 to 1819. The other is no earlier than the reign of
Tau-kwang.

In both monasteries the eighteen *Lo-hans* (Arhans), usually placed in
the central hall of temples, are found in side chapels, their place
being occupied by the thirty-two figures of Kwan-yin. These supposed
beings are a step inferior to the rank of Bodhisattwa; both are inferior
to Buddha. The reverence paid to Kwan-yin is not, however, less on this
account. Like other deities of the same rank, Kwan-yin has refused for a
time to become Buddha, preferring to save mankind by discoursing to them
on the doctrines of this religion, and inducing them to enter on the
path to the Nirvâna.

In a small temple called Hung-fa-t‘ang, just beyond the first monastery,
is an interesting representation of the eighteen Arhans crossing the
sea. They are seated on various sea animals. The proper names of these
personages are all Hindoo, and unfamiliar in their sound, from the
circumstance that they do not occur in current legends, but only in more
recondite ones, contained in some among the great collection of works
termed *Tsang-king*. The names of well-known deities are therefore
frequently substituted for them, such as Kwan-yin, Maitreya, and
Ti-tsang-wang. The last of these is seated on a large sea quadruped in
the representation here referred to. While he sleeps, a star with a
stream of light issues from his head. Beside him, sitting on a dragon,
are two youths called "Joy" (*Ki-k‘ing*) and "Rest" (*B‘ing-an*). The
one, in a playful humour, wishes to wake his sleeping neighbour, but he
is checked by his companion. Bodhidharma, the founder of the
contemplative school in China, is introduced seated on what is termed a
"one-horned immortal bull." He carries a

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

pole on his shoulder with one shoe suspended on it. The story is that,
on crossing the Yang-tsze keang, he dropped the other, which was picked
up by a countryman, and was found to possess wonderful powers. Manjusiri
is seated on a sea demon. A tiger is whispering at his ear. He thus
learns what people at a distance are doing. It should be remembered that
the attribute of this great Bodhisattwa is wisdom. In the same
representation Kwan-yin sits on some other sea animal. He is pouring the
elixir of life from a gourd. As it flows out it becomes the genius of a
star.

There is no difficulty felt by the arrangers of temples in placing the
Bodhisattwas among the Arhans, because they have all necessarily passed
through that state before arriving at their present position. So the
Arhan is only such after passing through three grades of discipleship,
which are the first steps on the road to the Nirvâna. The Buddha himself
must go through all these stages from the first introduction to the
sacred life up to the state of Bodhisattwa. They form the ladder from
the actual world of human life to that cloud-land of abstractions which
the contemplative Buddhist hopes to reach at last. In accordance with
this, the hermit life of Shakyamuni Buddha is depicted on the walls of
the same temple. Above the eighteen Arhans just described, is a
representation, in painted clay, of the Himalayas. Here is seen a hut of
rushes inhabited by the future Buddha. Monkeys and sacred geese bring
him food, and dragons, tigers, and white rabbits are his near
neighbours.

In the third monastery, high on the hill called Fo-ting shan, is a
somewhat remarkable representation of the Hindoo gods. They are presided
over by Yü-hwang of the Brahma heaven. I could not, however, obtain an
intelligent account of them from the illiterate priest who was residing
there. He was an artisan from Kieu-kiang in Kiang-si, who had left his
wife and family in charge of his eldest son, and become a monk.

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

At another smaller temple, where there are several caves, each with one
or more small stone Buddhas seated inside, shown to visitors as
emblematic of the hermit life, I found a young priest very ready to
defend his system. When the worship of Buddha was objected to, on the
ground that it substituted the creature for the Creator, he replied that
Shakyamuni Buddha, being at the head of the Hwa-tsang universe, was far
higher in dignity than He who ruled this lesser universe. He was
reminded in reply that the vast *Hwa-tsang-shï-kiai*, a congeries of an
immense number of lesser worlds, was nothing but an invention of the
author of the *Hwa-yen-king*, and that in reality there was no existence
or world not included within the dominions of God. He did not attempt to
continue the argument.

Facing the first monastery is a small pagoda, dedicated to the Ming
emperor, known as Wan-li hwang-ti. This prince before ascending the
throne had conferred benefits on the institutions of the island, and
this pagoda was named after him *T‘ai-tsï-t‘a*, "Pagoda of the crown
prince." On its four sides are placed stone images of the four great
Bodhisattwas, to each of whom one of the four elements is assigned.
Ti-tsang, under whose jurisdiction hell is supposed to be, presides over
earth. He is said to have become incarnate in a former Siamese prince.
He is worshipped specially in the South at Kieu-hwa, near Nanking.
Kwan-yin presides over water. His attribute is mercy, and he is
worshipped in the East at P‘u-to. P‘u-hien presides over fire. His
attribute is happiness, and he is worshipped in the West at the Woo-wei
mountain in Sï-ch‘wen. Manjusiri presides over air (wind), and is
worshipped in Shan-si. His attribute is wisdom.

Inscriptions on rocks lining the paths are very numerous at P‘u-to. Most
of them are Buddhistic. Some specimens of them will be now given.
*Hwei-t‘eu-shï-an*, "You have but to turn back and you will have reached
the shore." *Teng-pei-an*, "Go up on that shore." The Buddhists say that
salvation is in knowledge. The disciple

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

is led by the teaching of Buddha, from the sea of ignorance to the
"Shore of true wisdom" (Prajna paramita, *Po-je po-lo-mi-to*),
*Kin-sheng-kio-lu*, "The golden thread that guides into the path of
intelligence." *Hwei-jï-tung-sheng*, "The sun of wisdom rises in the
east." *Teng-ta-yuen-cheu*, "Ascend the ship of great wishes." The great
wish of a Buddha or a P‘u-sa is to save mankind and all living beings.
They rescue those who are struggling in the sea of life and death, and
vice and virtue, and convey them to the shore of true knowledge. Hence
Kwan-yin is called *Ts‘ï-hang*, "Vessel of mercy."
*Fa-lun-ch‘ang-chwen*, "The wheel of the law constantly revolves." This
refers to the unceasing proclamation by books and monks of the doctrines
of Shakyamuni. The metaphor by which Buddhist preaching is called the
revolving of the wheel, is seen practically exemplified in the
praying-wheels of Mongolia, by the turning of which an accumulation of
merit is obtained. So in China, the whole Buddhist library of several
thousand volumes is placed in a large octagonal revolving bookcase,
which is pushed round at the instance of the visitor.

At Jehol, about a hundred and twenty miles north-east of Peking, there
is a nest of lama monasteries, in a valley close to the emperor's
hunting-lodge and summer palace. Among these monasteries are some of
Thibetan architecture, the chief of which is Potala. It is modelled
after the Potala in which the Dalai Lama lives at Lhassa in Thibet. The
Dalai Lama is a living incarnation of Kwan-yin, and therefore his
palace-temple was called Potala. This name is applied variously to a
sea-port at the mouth of the Indus, the seat of Shakyamuni's ancestors,
and to a mountain range near or part of the Nilgherries where
Avalôkitêshwara was fond of going, in addition to the island in the
Indian Ocean, the palace at Lhassa, and the Chinese P‘u-to. For
particulars, see in Eitel, p. 93.

Perhaps the island may have been at the mouth of the

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Indus, and left
its name in the present Tatta, the *Pattala* of the Greeks.

The setting apart of the island P‘u-to, in the Chusan Archipelago, is
proof that the Buddhist imagination, in selecting a place for the
special worship of Kwan-yin in China, preferred an island. This agreed
best with the legends.

Here Kwan-yin would, in expounding the *dharma* that is to save living
beings, seem more in her place than on a mountain of the main-land. This
is an appropriate *tau-c‘hang* <span id="fr_108"></span>[1](#fn_108.md) for
her, where she can be at hand to rescue sailors from the dangers of the
sea, and where crowds of pilgrims will in fair weather not be wanting to
receive the benefit of her instructions.
