"*He that hath madness*," *etc*.--This story the Master told at
Jetavana, about a fellow-priest of the Elder Sāriputta. \[421\] This
brother came and greeted the Elder, and sitting on one side, he asked
him to tell the way in which one could get gain, and how he could get
dress and the like. The Elder replied, "Friend, there are four qualities
which make a man successful in getting gain. He must get rid of modesty
from his heart, must resign his orders, must seem to be mad even if he
is not; he must speak slander; he must behave like a dancer; he must use
unkind words everywhere." Thus he explained how a man gets a great deal.
The brother objected to this method, and went away. The Elder went to
his Master, and told him about it. The Master said, "This is not the
first time that this brother spoke in dispraise of gain; he did the same
before;" and then, at the request of the Elder, he told an old-world
tale.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta
was born in a Brahmin family. When he grew up to the age of sixteen
years, he had already mastered the three Vedas and the eighteen
accomplishments; and he became a far-famed teacher, who educated a body
of five hundred young men. One young man, a youth of virtuous life,
approached his teacher one day with the question, "How is it these
people get gain?

The teacher answered, "My son, there fife four qualities which procure
gain for those people;" and he repeated the first stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"He that hath madness, he that slanders well,  
That hath an actor's tricks, ill tales doth tell,  
Such is the man that wins prosperity  
Where all are fools: let this your maxim be."</span>

</div>

\[422\] The pupil, on hearing his master's words, expressed his
disapproval of gain-getting in the two following stanzas:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Shame upon him that gain or glory wins  
By dire destruction and by wicked sins.

"With bowl in hand a homeless life I'll lead  
Rather than live in wickedness and greed."

</div>

\[423\] Thus did the youth praise the quality of the religious life; and
straight became a hermit, and craved alms with righteousness,
cultivating the Attainments, until he became destined to Brahma's world.

When the Master had ended this discourse he thus identified the
Birth:--"At that time the brother who disapproved of gain was the young
man, but his teacher was I myself."
