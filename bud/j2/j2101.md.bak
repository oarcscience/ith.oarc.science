\[265\] "*All have seen*," *etc*.--This story the Master told whilst
staying at Jetavana, on the Chapter about the Judas tree <span
id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_151.md).

Four Brothers, approaching the Tathāgata, asked him to explain the means
by which ecstasy may be induced. This he explained. This done, they
dispersed to the several places where they spent their nights and days.
One of them, having learnt the Six Spheres of Touch, became a saint;
another did so after learning the Five Elements of Being, the third
after learning the Four Principal Elements, the fourth after learning
the Eighteen Constituents of Being. Each of them recounted to the Master
the particular excellence which he had attained. A thought came into the
mind of one of them; and he asked the Master, "There is only one Nirvana
for all these modes of meditation; how is it that all of them lead to
sainthood?" Then the Master asked, "Is not this like the people who saw
the Judas tree?" As they requested him to tell them about it, he
repeated a tale of bygone days.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once on a time Brahmadatta the king of Benares had four sons. One day
they sent for the charioteer, and said to him,

"We want to see a Judas tree; show us one!"

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

"Very well, I will," the charioteer replied. But he did not show it to
them all together. He took the eldest at once to the forest in the
chariot, and showed him the tree at the time when the buds were just
sprouting from the stem. To the second he showed it when the leaves were
green, to the third at the time of blossoming, and to the fourth when it
was bearing fruit.

After this it happened that the four brothers were sitting together, and
some one asked, "What sort of a tree is the Judas tree?" Then the first
brother answered,

"Like a burnt stump!"

And the second cried, "Like a banyan tree!"

And the third--"Like a piece of meat <span
id="fr_152"></span>[1](#fn_152.md)!"

And the fourth said, "Like the acacia!"

They were vexed at each other's answers, and ran to find their father.
"My lord," they asked, "what sort of a tree is the Judas tree?"

"What did you say to that?" he asked. They told him the manner of their
answers. Said the king,

"All four of you have seen the tree. Only when the charioteer showed you
the tree, you did not ask him 'What is the tree like at such a time?'
\[266\] or 'at such another time?' You made no distinctions, and that is
the reason of your mistake." And he repeated the first stanza

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"All have seen the Judas tree--  
What is your perplexity?  
No one asked the charioteer  
What its form the livelong year!"</span>

</div>

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The Master, having explained the matter, then addressed the Brethren:
"Now as the four brothers, because they did not make a distinction and
ask, fell in doubt about the tree, so you have fallen in doubt about the
right": and in his perfect wisdom he uttered the second verse:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Who know the right with some deficiency  
Feel doubt, like those four brothers with the tree."</span>

</div>

When this discourse was ended, the Master identified the Birth: "At that
time I was the king of Benares."
