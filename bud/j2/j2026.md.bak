\[68\] "*Father, see! a poor old fellow*," *etc*.--This story the Master
told whilst staying in Jetavana, about a rogue.--The circumstances will
be explained in the Uddāla Birth <span id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md),
Book xiv. Here too the Master said, "Brethren, not this once only has
the fellow turned out a rogue; in days of yore, when he was a monkey, he
played tricks for the sake of a fire." And he told a tale of days long
gone by.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family in a village of Kāsi.. When he
came of years, he received his education at Takkasilā, and settled down
in life.

His lady in time bore him a son; and when the child could just run to
and fro, she died. The husband performed her obsequies, and then, said
he, "What is home to me now? I and my son will live the life of
hermits." Leaving his friends and kindred in tears, he took the lad to
the Himalaya, became a religious anchorite, and lived on the fruits and
roots which the forest yielded.

On a day during the rainy season, when there had been a downpour, he
kindled some sticks, and lay down on a pallet, warming himself at the
fire. And his son sat beside him chafing his feet.

Now a wild Monkey, miserable with cold, spied the fire in the leaf-hut
of our hermit. "Now," thought he, "suppose I go in: they'll cry out
Monkey! Monkey! and beat me back: I shan't get a chance of warming
myself.--I have it!" he cried. "I'll get an ascetic's dress, and get
inside by a trick!" So he put on the bark dress of a dead ascetic,
lifted his basket and crooked stick, and took his stand by the hut door,
where he crouched down beside a palm tree. The lad saw him, and cried to
his father (not knowing he was a monkey) "Here's an old hermit, sure
enough, miserably cold, come to warm himself at the fire." \[69\] Then
he addressed his father in the words of the first stanza, begging him to
let the poor fellow in to warm himself:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Father, see! a poor old fellow huddled by a
palmtree there!  
Here we have a hut to live in; let us give the man a share."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

When the Bodhisatta heard this, up he got and went to the door But when
he saw the creature was only a monkey, he said, "My son, men have no
such face as that; ’tis a monkey, and he must not be asked in here."
Then he repeated the second stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"He would but defile our dwelling if he came inside
the door;  
Such a face--’tis easy telling--no good brahmin ever bore."</span>

</div>

The Bodhisatta seized a brand, crying--"What do you want there?"--threw
it at him, and drove him away. Mr Monkey dropt his bark garments, sprang
up a tree, and buried himself in the forest.

Then the Bodhisatta cultivated the Four Excellences until he came unto
Brahma's heaven.

When the Master had ended this discourse, he identified the Birth: "This
tricky Brother was the Monkey of those days; Rāhula <span
id="fr_45"></span>[1](j2027.htm#fn_45.md) was the hermit's son, and I
myself was the hermit." '
