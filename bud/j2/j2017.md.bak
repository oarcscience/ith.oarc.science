"*A vulture sees a corpse*," *etc*.--This story the Master told about a
Brother who had his mother to support. The circumstances will be related
under the Sāma Birth <span id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md). The Master
asked him whether he, a Brother, was really supporting persons who were
still living in the world. This the Brother admitted, "How are they
related to you?" the Master went on. "They are my parents, Sir."
"Excellent, excellent," the Master said; and bade the Brethren not be
angry with this Brother. "Wise men of old," said he, "have done service
even to those who were not of kin to them; but this man's task has been
to support his own parents." So saying, he told them this story of
bygone days.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta
came to life as a young Vulture on the Vulture Hill, and had his mother
and father to nourish.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

Once there came a great wind and rain. The Vultures could not hold their
own against it; half frozen, they flew to Benares, and there near the
wall and near the ditch they sat, shivering with the cold.

A merchant of Benares was issuing from the city on his way to bathe,
when he spied these miserable Vultures. He got them together in a dry
place, made a fire, sent and brought them some cowflesh from the
cattle's burning-place, and put some one to look after them.

When the storm fell, \[51\] our Vultures were all right and flew off at
once among the mountains. Without delay they met, and thus took counsel
together. "A Benares merchant has done us a good turn; and one good turn
deserves another, as the saying is <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md):
so after this when any of us finds a garment or an ornament it must be
dropt in that merchant's courtyard." So thenceforward if they ever
noticed people drying their clothes or finery in the sun, watching for
an unwary moment, they snatched them quickly, as hawks swoop on a bit of
meat, and dropt them in the merchant's yard. But he, whenever he
observed that they were bringing him anything, used to cause it to be
laid aside.

They told the king how vultures were plundering the city. "Just catch me
one vulture," says the king, "and I will make them bring it all back."
So snares and gins were set everywhere; our dutiful Vulture was caught.
They seized him with intent to bring him to the king. The Merchant
aforesaid, on the way to wait upon his majesty, saw these people walking
along with the Vulture. He went in their company, for fear they might
hurt the Vulture.

They gave the Vulture to the king, who examined him.

"You rob our city, and carry off clothes and all sorts of things," he
began.--"Yes, Sire."--"Whom have they been given to?"--"A merchant of
Benares."--"Why?"--"Because he saved our lives, and they say one good
turn deserves another; that is why we gave them to him."

"Vultures, they say," quoth the king, "can spy a corpse an hundred
leagues away; and can't you see a trap set ready for you?" And with
these words he repeated the first stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A vulture sees a corpse that lies one hundred
leagues away:  
When thou alightst upon a trap dost thou not see it, pray?"</span>

</div>

\[52\] The Vulture listened, then replied by repeating the second
stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When life is coming to an end, and death's hour
draws anigh,  
Though you may come close up to it, nor trap nor snare you spy."</span>

</div>

After this response of the Vulture, the king turned to our Merchant.
"Have all these things really been brought to you, then, by the
Vultures?"

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Yes, my lord."
"Where are they?" "My lord, they are all put away; each shall receive
his own again:--only let this Vulture go!" He had his way; the Vulture
was set at liberty, and the Merchant returned all the property to its
owners.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This lesson ended, the Master declared the Truths, and identified the
Birth:--at the conclusion of the Truths the dutiful Brother was
established in the fruition of the First Path:--"Ānanda was the king of
those days; Sāriputta was the Merchant; and I myself was the Vulture
that supported his parents."

folk-tales.
