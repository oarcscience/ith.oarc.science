"*Thick, muddy water*," *etc*.--This story the Master told while staying
in Jetavana, and it was about a young brahmin.

A young brahmin, as they say, belonging to Sāvatthi, had mastered the
Three Vedas, and used to teach sacred verses to a number of young
brahmins and kshatriyas. In time he settled down as a married man. His
thoughts being now busy with wealth and ornaments, serving men and
serving women, lands and substance, kine and buffaloes, sons and
daughters, he became subject to passion, error, folly. This obscured his
wits, so that he forgot how to repeat his formulæ in due order, and
every now and then the charms did not come clear in his mind. This man
one day procured a quantity of flowers and sweet scents, and these he
took to the Master in Jetavana Park. After his greeting, he sat down on
one side. \[100\] The Master talked pleasantly to him. "Well, young Sir,
you are a teacher of the sacred verses. Do you know them all by heart?"
"Well, Sir, I used to know them all right, but since I married my mind
has been darkened, and I don't know them any longer." "Ah, young Sir,"
the Master said, "just the same happened before; at first your mind was
clear, and you knew all your verses perfectly, but when your mind was
obscured by passions and lusts, you could no longer clearly see them."
Then at his request the Master told the following story.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta
was born in the family of a brahmin magnifico. When he grew up, it
studied under a far-famed teacher of Takkasilā, where he learnt all

magic charms. After returning to Benares he taught these charms to a
large number of Brahmin and kshatriya youths.

Amongst these youths was one young brahmin who had learnt the Three
Vedas by heart; he became a master of ritual <span
id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64), and could repeat the whole of the sacred
texts without stumbling in a single line. By and bye he married and
settled down. Then household cares clouded his mind, and no longer could
he repeat the sacred verses.

One day his teacher paid him a visit. "Well, young Sir," he enquired,
"do you know all your verses off by heart?" "Since, l have been the head
of a household," was the reply, "my mind has been clouded, and I cannot
repeat them." "My son," said his teacher, "when the mind is clouded, no
matter how perfectly the scriptures have been learnt, they will not
stand out clear. But when the mind is serene there is no forgetting
them." And thereupon he repeated the two verses following:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

    "Thick, muddy water will not show  
Fish or shell or sand or gravel that may lie below <span
id="fr_65"></span>[2](#fn_65):  
         So with a clouded wit:  
      Nor your nor other's good is seen in it.

    "Clear, quiet waters ever show  
All, be it fish or shell, that lies below; \[101\]  
         So with unclouded wit:  
      Both your and other's good shows clear in it."

When the Master had finished this discourse, he declared the Truths, and
identified the Birth:--at the conclusion of the Truths the young Brahmin
entered upon the Fruit of the First Path:--"In those days, this youth
was the young brahmin, and I was his teacher."

<span id="fn_64"></span>[69:1](j2038.htm#fr_64) Or it may mean 'a
pupil-teacher.'

<span id="fn_65"></span>[69:2](j2038.htm#fr_65) There is an irregularity
in this stanza, the Pali having an extra line. I have reproduced this by
making line 2 of an irregular length.
