\[431\] "*A ne’er-do-well did once*," *etc*.--This story the Master told
at Jetavana, about a nephew of Anāthapiṇḍika. This person had squandered
an inheritance of forty crores of gold. Then the visited his uncle, who
gave him a thousand, and bade him trade with it. The man squandered
this, and then came again; and

once more he was given five hundred. Having squandered this like the
rest, next time his uncle gave him two coarse garments; and when he had
worn these out, and once more applied, his uncle had him taken by the
neck and turned out of doors. The fellow was helpless, and fell down by
a side-wall and died. They dragged him outside and threw him down there.
Anāthapiṇḍika went and told the Buddha what had happened to his nephew.
Said the Master, "How could you expect to satisfy the man whom I long
ago failed to satisfy, even when I gave him the Wishing Cup?" and at his
request, he proceeded to tell him an old-world tale.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta was born as a rich merchant's son; and after his father's
death, took his place. In his house was buried a treasure of four
hundred million. He had an only son. The Bodhisatta gave alms and did
good until he died, and then he came to life again as Sakka, king of the
gods. His son proceeded to make a pavilion across the road, and sat down
with many friends round him, to drink. He paid a thousand pieces to
runners and tumblers, singers and dancers, and passed his time in
drinking, gluttony, and debauchery; he wandered about, asking only for
song, music, and dancing, devoted to his boon-companions, sunk in sloth.
So in a short time he squandered all his treasure of four hundred
millions, \[432\] all his property, goods, and furniture, and got so
poor and miserable that he had to go about clad in rags.

Sakka, as he meditated, became aware how poor he was. Overcome with love
for his son, he gave him a Wishing Cup, with these words: "Son, take
care not to break this cup. So long as you keep it, your wealth will
never come to an end. So take good care of it!" and then he returned to
heaven.

After that the man did nothing but drink out of it. One day, he was
drunk, and threw the cup into the air, catching it as it fell. But once
he missed it. Down it fell upon the earth, and smashed! Then he got poor
again, and went about in rags, begging, bowl in hand, till at last he
lay down by a wall, and died.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

When the Master had finished this tale, he went on:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"A ne’er-do-well did once a Bowl acquire,  
A Bowl that gave hire all his heart's desire.  
And of this Bowl so long as he took care,  
        His fortunes were all fair.

"When, proud and drunken, in a careless hour,  
He broke the Bowl that gave him all this power,  
Naked, poor fool! in rags and tatters, he  
        Fell in great misery. <span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

"Not otherwise whoso great fortune owes,  
But in the enjoying it no measure knows,  
Is scorched anon, even as the knave--poor soul!--  
        That broke his Wishing Bowl."

</div>

Repeating these stanzas in his perfect wisdom, he identified the Birth:
"At that time Anāthapiṇḍika's nephew was the rascal who broke the Lucky
Cup, but I myself was Sakka."
