"*Over the salt sea wave*," *etc*.--This story the Master told at
Jetavana, about Elder Upananda. This man was a great eater and drinker;
there was no satisfying him even with cartloads of provisions. During
the rainy season he would pass his time at two or three different
settlements, leaving his shoes in one, his walking-stick in another, and
his water jar in a third, and one he lived in himself. When he visited a
country monastery, and saw the brothers with their requisites all ready,
he began to talk about the four classes of contented ascetics <span
id="fr_232"></span>[2](#fn_231.md); laid hold of their garments, and made
them pick up rags from the dust-heap; made them take earthen bowls, and
give him any bowls that he fancied and their metal bowls; then he filled
a cart with them, and carried them off to Jetavana. One day people began
to talk in the Hall of Truth. "Friend, Upananda of the Sakka clan, a
great eater, a greedy fellow, has been preaching religion to other
people, and here he comes with a cartful of priests’ property!" The
Master came in, and wanted to know what they were talking of as they sat
there. They told him. "Brethren," said he, "Upananda has gone wrong
before by talking about this contentment. But a man ought first of all
to become modest in his desires, before praising the good behaviour of
other people.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pointing out this
verse from the Dhammapada <span id="fr_233"></span>[1](#fn_232.md), and
blaming Upananda, he went on, "This is not the first time, Brethren,
that Upananda has been greedy. Long ago, he thought even the water in
the ocean ought to be saved." And he told an old-world tale.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta
became a Sea-spirit. Now it so happened that a Water-crow was passing
over the sea. He went flying about, and trying to cheek the shoals of
fish and flocks of birds, crying,

"Don't drink too much of the sea-water! be careful of it!" \[442\] On
seeing him, the Sea-spirit repeated the first stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Over the salt sea wave who flies?  
Who checks the shoals of fish, and tries  
The monsters of the deep to stay  
Lest all the sea be drunk away?"</span>

</div>

The Water-crow heard this, and answered with the second stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A drinker never satisfied  
So people call me the world wide,  
To drink the sea I fain would trey,  
And drain the lord of rivers dry.'"</span>

</div>

On hearing which the Sea-spirit repeated the third:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The ocean ever ebbs away,  
And fills again the selfsame day.  
Who ever knew the sea to fail?  
To drink it up can none avail!"</span>

</div>

With these words the spirit assumed a terrible shape and frightened the
Water-crow away.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

When the Master had ended this discourse, he identified the Birth: "At
that time, Upananda was the Water-crow, but the Spirit was I myself."
