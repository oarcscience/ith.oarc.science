"*Gold-clawed creature*," *etc*.--\[341\] This story the Master told
while dwelling at Jetavana, about a certain woman.

We are told that a certain land-owner of Sāvatthi, with his wife, was on
a journey into the country for the purpose of collecting debts, when he
fell among robbers. Now the wife was very beautiful and charming. The
robber chief was so taken by her that he purposed killing the husband to
get her. But the woman was good and virtuous, a devoted wife. She fell
at the robber's feet, crying, "My lord, if you kill my husband for love
of me, I will take poison, or stop my breath, and kill myself too! With
you I will not go. Do not kill my husband uselessly!" In this way she
begged him off.

They both got back safe to Sāvatthi. Then it occurred to them as they
passed the monastery in Jetavana, that they would visit it and salute
the Master. So to the perfumed cell they went, and after salutation sat
down on one side. The Master asked them where they had been. "To collect
our debts," they replied. "Did your journey pass off without mishap?" he
asked next. "We were captured by robbers on the way," said the husband,
"and the chief wanted to murder me; but my wife here begged me off, and
I owe my life to her." Then said the Master, "You are not the only one,
layman, whose life she has saved. In days of yore she saved the lives of
other wise men." And then at his request the Master told an old-world
tale.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once on a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, there was a great
lake in Himalaya, wherein was a great golden Crab. Because he lived
there, the place was known as the Crab Tarn. The Crab was very large, as
big round as a threshing floor; it would catch elephants, and kill

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

and eat them; and from fear of it \[342\] the elephants durst not go
down and browse there.

Now the Bodhisatta was conceived by the mate of an elephant, the leader
of a herd, living hard by this Crab Tarn. The mother, in order to be
safe till her delivery, sought another place on a mountain, and there
she was delivered of a son; who in due time grew to years of wisdom, and
was great and mighty, and prospered, and he was like a purple mountain
of collyrium.

He chose another elephant for his mate, and he resolved to catch this
Crab. So with his mate and his mother, he sought out the elephant herd,
and finding his father, proposed to go and catch the Crab.

"You will not be able to do that, my son," said he.

But he begged the father again and again to give him leave, until at
last he said, "Well, you may try."

So the young Elephant collected all the elephants beside the Crab Tarn,
and led them close by the lake. "Does the Crab catch them when they go
down, or while they are feeding, or when they come up again?"

They replied, "When the beasts come up again."

"Well then," said he, "do you all go down to the lake and eat whatever
you see, and come up first; I will follow last behind you." And so they
did. Then the Crab, seeing the Bodhisatta coming up last, caught his
feet tight in his claw, like a smith who seizes a lump of iron in a huge
pair of tongs. The Bodhisatta's mate did not leave him, but stood there
close by him. The Bodhisatta pulled at the Crab, but could not make him
budge. Then the Crab pulled, and drew him towards himself. At this in
deadly fear the Elephant roared and roared; hearing which all the other
elephants, in deadly terror, ran off trumpeting, and dropping excrement.
Even his mate could not stand, but began to make off. \[343\] Then to
tell her how he was held a prisoner, he uttered the first stanza, hoping
to stay her from her flight:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Gold-clawed <span id="fr_184"></span>[1](#fn_183)
creature with projecting eyes,  
Tarn-bred, hairless, clad in bony shell,  
He has caught me! hear my woful cries!--  
Mate! don't leave me--for you love me well!"</span>

</div>

Then his mate turned round, and repeated. the second stanza to his
comfort:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Leave you? never! never will I go--  
Noble husband, with your years threescore.  
All four quarters of the earth can show  
None so dear as thou hast been of yore."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

this s way she encouraged him; and saying, "Noble sir, now I will talk
to the Crab a while to make him let you go," she addressed the Crab in
the third stanza: \[344\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Of all the crabs that in the sea,  
Ganges, or Nerbudda be,  
You are best and chief, I know:  
Hear me--let my husband go!"</span>

</div>

As she spoke thus, the Crab's fancy was smitten with the sound of the
female voice, and forgetting all fear he loosed his claws from the
Elephant's leg, and suspected nothing of what he would do when he was
set free. Then the Elephant lifted his foot, and stepped upon the Crab's
back; and at once his eyes startled out. The Elephant shouted the
joy-cry. Up ran the other elephants all, pulled the Crab along and set
him upon the ground, and trampled him to mincemeat. His two claws broken
from his body lay apart. And this Crab Tarn, being near the Ganges, when
there was a flood in the Ganges, was filled with Ganges water; when the
water subsided it ran from the lake into the Ganges. Then these two
claws were lifted and floated along the Ganges. One of them reached the
sea, the other was found by the ten royal brothers while playing in the
water, and they took it and made of it the little drum called Ānaka. The
Titans found that which reached the sea, and made it into the drum
called Āḷambara. These afterwards being worsted in battle with Sakka,
ran off and left it behind. Then Sakka caused it to be kept for his own
use; and it is of this they say, "There is thunder like the Āḷambara
cloud!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

When this discourse was ended, the Master declared the Truths, and
identified the Birth:--at the conclusion of the Truths both husband and
wife attained the 'Fruit of the First Path:--\[345\] "In those days,
this lay sister was the she-elephant, and I myself was her mate."

<span id="fn_183"></span>[236:1](j2120.htm#fr_184) *Siṅgī* means either
'horned' or 'gold,' and the scholiast gives both interpretations. As the
word suggested both to the writer, I use a word which expresses both in
English.
