"*See that twice-born bird*," *etc*.--This story the Master told while
staying in Jetavana, about a hypocrite. When he was brought before the
Master, the Master said, "Brethren, he was a hypocrite of old just as he
is now," and told the following story.

\[234\] Once on a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the
Bodhisatta became a Fish in a certain pond in the Himalaya region, and a
great shoal went with him. Now a Crane desired to eat the fish. So in a
place near the pond he drooped his head, and spread out his wings, and
looked vacantly, vacantly at the fish, waiting till they were off their
guard <span id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_131). At the same moment the
Bodhisatta with his shoal came to that place in search of food. And the
shoal of fish on seeing the crane uttered the first stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"See that twice-born <span
id="fr_132"></span>[2](#fn_132) bird, how white--  
  Like a water-lily seeming;  
Wings outspread to left and right--  
  Oh, how pious! dreaming, dreaming!"</span>

</div>

Then the Bodhisatta looked, and uttered the second stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"What he is ye do not know,  
  Or you would not sing his praises.  
He is our most treacherous foe;  
  That is why no wing he raises."</span>

</div>

Thereupon the fish splashed in the water and drove the crane away.

When this discourse was ended, the Master identified the Birth:--"This
hypocrite was the Crane, and I was the chief of the shoal of fish."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_131"></span>[162:1](j2089.htm#fr_131) A crane's sleep" is
an Indian proverb for trickery.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[162:2](j2089.htm#fr_132) *dijo* is used of a
bird as born in the egg and from the egg. It is also applied to
Brahmins, and so conveys an additional notion of piety.
