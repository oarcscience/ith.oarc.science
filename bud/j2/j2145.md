### SUPATTA-JĀTAKA <span id="fr_226"></span>[1](#fn_225).

\[433\] "*Here, in Benares city*," *etc*.--This story the Master told in
Jetavana, about a meal of rice mixed with new ghee, with red fish to
flavour it, which was given by Elder Sāriputta to Bimbādevī. The
circumstances are like those given above in the Abbhantara
Birth-tale <span id="fr_227"></span>[2](#fn_226). Here too the holy
Sister had a pain in the stomach. The excellent Rāhula told the Elder.
He seated Rāhula in his waiting-room, and went to the king to get the
rice, red fish and new ghee. The lad gave it to the holy sister, his
mother. No sooner had she eaten than the pain subsided. The king sent
messengers to make enquiries, and after that always sent her that kind
of food. One day they began to talk about it in the Hall of Truth:
"Friend, the Captain of the Faith satisfied the Sister with such and
such food." The Master came in, and asked what they were talking about:
they told him. Said he, "This is not the first time, Brother, that
Sāriputta has given Rāhula's mother what she wanted; he did the same
before." So saying, he told an old-world tale.

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta
was born as a Crow. He grew up, and became chief of eighty thousand
crows, a Crow king, by name, Supatta, or Fairwing; and his chief mate
went by the name of Suphassā or Softie, his chief Captain was called
Sumukho--Prettybeak. With his eighty thousand subjects, he dwelt hard by
Benares.

One day he and his mate in search of food passed over the king's
kitchen. The king's cook had been preparing a host of dishes, of all
sorts of fish, and he had uncovered the dishes for a moment, to cool
them. Queen Crow smelt the odour of the food, and longed for a hit. But
that day she said nothing.

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

However the next day, when King Crow proposed that they should go
a-feeding, she said, "Go by yourself: there's something I want very
much!"

"What is it?" asked he.

"I want some of the king's food to eat; \[434\] and as I can't get it, I
am going to die."

The Crow sat down to think. Prettybeak approached him and asked if
anything had displeased him. King Crow told him what it was. "Oh,
that'll be all right," said the Captain; and added, to console them
both, "you stay where you are to-day, and I'll fetch the meat."

So he gathered the Crows together, and told them the matter. "Now come,
and let's get it!" said he; and off they all flew together to Benares.
He posted them in companies here and there, near the kitchen to watch;
and he, with eight champions, sat on the kitchen roof. While waiting for
the king's food to be served, he gave his directions to these: "When the
food is taken up, I'll make the man drop the dishes. Once that is done
there's an end of me. So four of you must fill your mouths with the
rice, and four with the fish, and feed our royal pair with them; and if
they ask where I am, say I'm coming."

Well, the cook got his various dishes all ready, hung them on a
balance-pole, and went off towards the king's rooms. As he passed
through the court, the Crow Captain with a signal to his followers flew
and settled upon the carrier's chest, struck him with extended claws,
with his beak, sharp as a spear-point, pecked the end of the man's nose,
and with his two feet stopped up his jaws.

The king was walking up and down upon an upper floor, when looking out
of a large window he saw what the crow was doing. He hailed the
carrier:"--Hullo you, down with the dishes and catch the crow!" so the
man dropt the dishes and caught the crow tight.

"Come here!" cried the king.

Then the crows ate all they wanted, \[435\] and picked up the rest as
they had been told, and carried it off. Next all the others flocked up,
and ate what remained. The eight champions gave it to their king and
queen to eat. The craving of Softie was appeased.

The servant who was carrying the dinner brought his crow to the king.

"O Crow!" said he, "you have shown no respect for me! you have broken my
servitor's nose! you have smashed my dishes! you have recklessly thrown
away your life! What made you do such things?"

Answered the Crow, "O great king! Our king lives near Benares, and I am
captain of his forces. His wife (whose name is Softie) conceived a great
longing, and wanted a taste of your food. Our king told me what she
craved. At once I devoted my life. Now I have sent her the food;

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

my desire is accomplished. This is the reason why I acted as I did." And
to explain the matter, he said

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Here in Benares city, O great king,  
There dwells a king of Crows that Night Fairwing;  
Who was attended by a following  
         Of eighty thousand Crows.

"Softie, his mate, had one o’ermastering wish:  
She craved a supper of the king's own fish,  
Fresh caught, cooked in his kitchen,--such a dish  
         As to kings' tables goes.

"You now behold me as their messenger;  
It was my royal master sent me here;  
And for that I my monarch do revere  
         I wounded that man's nose."

</div>

\[436\] When the king heard this, he said, "We do great honour to men,
and yet cannot make friends of them. Even though we make presents of
such things as a whole village, we can find no one willing to give his
life for us. But this creature, crow as he is, sacrifices life for his
king. He is very noble, sweet-speaking, and good." He was so pleased
with the crow's good qualities that he did him the honour of giving him
a white umbrella. But the crow saluted the king with this, his own gift,
and descanted upon the virtues of Fairwing. The king sent for him, and
heard his teaching, and sent them both food of the same sort as he ate
himself; and for the rest of the crows he had cooked each day a large
measure of rice. He himself walked according to the monition of the
Bodhisatta, and protecting all creatures, practised virtue. The
admonitions of Fairwing the crow were remembered for seven hundred
years.

When the Master had ended this discourse, he identified the Birth: "At
that time the king was Ānanda, the Captain was Sāriputta, but Supatta
was I myself."
