"*To hell shall go he*" *etc*.--This story the Master told at Jetavana,
about the murder of Sundarī. At that time we learn that the Bodhisatta
was honoured and respected. The circumstances were the same as in the
Kandhaka <span id="fr_215"></span>[2](#fn_214.md); this is an abstract of
them. The brotherhood of the Blessed One had received gain and honour
like five rivers pouring in a mighty flood; the heretics, finding that
gain and honour came to them no longer, becoming dim like fireflies at
sunrise, they collected together, and took counsel: "Ever since the
priest Gotama appeared, our gain and glory has gone from us. Not a soul
ever knows that we exist. Who will help us to bring reproach on Gotama,
and prevent him from getting all this?" Then an idea occurred to them.
"Sundarī will make us able to do it." So when one day Sundarī visited
the heretics' grove, they gave her greeting, but said nothing more. She
addressed them again and again, but received no answer. "Has anything
annoyed the holy fathers?" she asked. "Why, sister," said they, "do not
you see how the priest Gotama annoys us, depriving us of alms and
honour?" "What can I do about it?" she said. "You, sister, are fair and
lovely. You can bring disgrace upon Gotama, and your words will
influence a great many, \[416\] and you can thus restore our gains and
good repute." She agreed, and took her leave. After this she used to
take flowers and scents and perfumes, camphor, condiments and fruits,
and at evening time, when a great crowd had entered the city after
hearing the Master's discourse, she would set her face towards Jetavana.
If any asked where she was going, she would say, "To the Priest Gotama;
I live with him in one perfumed chamber." Then she spent the night in a
heretical settlement, and in the morning entered the road which led from
Jetavana into the city. If any asked her where she was going, she
replied, "I have been with the priest Gotama in one perfumed chamber,
and he made love to me." After the lapse of some days they hired some
ruffians to kill Sundarī before Gotama's chamber and throw her body into
the dust-heap. And so they did. Then the heretics made a hue and cry
after Sundarī, and informed the king. He asked where their suspicions
pointed. They answered that she had gone the last few days to Jetavana,
but what happened afterwards they did not know. He sent them to search
for her. Acting on this permission, they took his own servants, and went
to Jetavana, where they hunted about till they found her in the
dust-heap. Calling for a litter, they brought the body into the town,
and told the king that the disciples of Gotama had killed Sundarī, and
thrown her in the dust-heap, in order to cloak the sin of their Master.
The king bade them scour the city. All through the streets they went,
crying, "Come and see what has been done by the priests of the Sakya
prince!" and came back to the palace door. The king had placed the body
of Sundarī upon a platform, and had it watched in the cemetery. All the
populace, except the holy disciples, went about inside the town, outside
the town, in the parks and in the woods, abusing the Brethren, and
crying out, "Come and see what the priests of the Sakya prince have
done!" The Brethren told all this to the Buddha. Said the Master, "Well,
go and reprove these people in these words:

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"To hell shall go he that delights in lies,  
And he who having done a thing, denies:  
\[417\] Both these, when death has carried them away,  
As men of evil deeds elsewhere shall rise <span
id="fr_216"></span>[1](#fn_215.md)."</span>

</div>

The king directed some men to find out whether Sundarī had been killed
by anybody else. Now the ruffians had drunk the blood-money, and were
quarrelling together. Said one to another, "You killed Sundarī with one
blow, and then threw her in the dust-heap, and here you are, buying
liquor with the blood-money!" "All right, all right," said the king's
messengers; and they caught the ruffians and dragged them before the
king. "Did you kill herd" asked the king. They said, yes, they did. "Who
bade you?" "The heretics, my lord." The king had the heretics summoned.
"Lift up Sundarī," said he, "and carry her round the city, crying as you
go: 'This woman Sundarī wanted to bring disgrace upon the priest Gotama;
we had her murdered; the guilt is not Gotama's, nor his disciples’; the
guilt is ours!'" They did so. A multitude of the unconverted believed,
and the heretics were kept out of mischief by receiving the punishment
for murder. Thenceforward the Buddha's reputation grew greater and
greater. And then one day they began to gossip in the Hall of Truth:
"Friend, the heretics thought to blacken the Buddha, and they only
blackened themselves: ever since, our gains and glory have increased!"
The Master came in, and asked what they were talking about? They told
him. "Brethren," said he, "it is impossible to make the Buddha impure.
Trying to stain the Buddha, is like trying to stain a gem of the first
water. In bygone ages people have wished to stain a fine jewel, and no
matter how they tried, they failed to do it." And he told them an
old-world tale.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta
was born into a Brahmin family. When he grew up, perceiving the
suffering that arises from desire, he went away, and traversed three
ranges of Himalaya, where he became a hermit, and lived in a hut of
leaves.

Near his hut was a crystal cave, in which lived thirty Boars. Near the
cave a Lion used to range. \[418\] His shadow used to be reflected in
the crystal. The Boars used to see this reflection, and terror made them
lean and thin-blooded. Thought they, "We see the reflection because this
crystal is clear. We will make it dirty and discolour it." So they got
some mud from a pool close by, and rubbed and rubbed the crystal with
it. But the crystal, being constantly polished by the boars' bristles,
got brighter than ever.

They did not know how to manage it; so they determined to ask the hermit
how they might sully the crystal. To him therefore they came, and after
respectful greeting, they sat down beside him, and gave utterance to
these two verses:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Seven summers we have been  
  Thirty in a crystal grot.  
Now we are keen to dull the sheen--  
  But dull it we can not. <span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

"Though we try with all our might  
To obscure its brilliancy,  
Still more bright shines forth the light,  
What can the reason be?"

</div>

The Bodhisatta listened. Then he repeated the third stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"’Tis precious crystal, spotless, bright, and
pure;  
No glass--its brilliancy for ever sure.  
Nothing on earth its brightness can impair.  
Boars, you had best betake yourselves elsewhere."</span>

</div>

And so they did, on hearing this answer. The Bodhisatta lost himself in
rapturous ecstasy, and became destined to Brahma's world.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After this discourse was ended, the Master identified the Birth: "At
that time, I was the hermit."
