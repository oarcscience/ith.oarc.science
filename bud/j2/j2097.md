"*What he sees*," *etc*.--This story the Master told at Jetavana, about
a turntail vagrant who wandered about the country.

It is said that this man could not find any one to argue with him in all
India; till he came to Sāvatthi, and asked whether any one could dispute
with him. Yes--ho was told--the Supreme Buddha; hearing which, he and a
multitude with him repaired to Jetavana, and put a question to the
Master,

whilst he was discoursing in the midst of the four kinds of disciples.
The Master answered his question, and then put one to him in return.
This the man failed to answer, got up, and turned tail. The crowd
sitting round exclaimed, "One word, Sir, vanquished the itinerant!" Said
the Master, "Yes, Brethren, and just as I have vanquished him now with
one word, so I did before." Then he told a story of olden days.

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta
was born a brahmin in the kingdom of Kāsi. He grew up, and mastered his
passions; and embracing the religious life, \[258\] he dwelt a long time
in the Himalayas.

He came down from the highlands, and took up his abode near a
considerable town, in a hut of leaves built beside a bend of the river
Ganges. A certain pilgrim, who found no one that could answer him
throughout all India, came to that town. "Is there anyone," asked he,
"who can argue with me?"

Yes, they said, and told him the power of the Bodhisatta. So, followed
by a great multitude, he made his way to the place where the Bodhisatta
dwelt, and after greeting him, took a seat.

"Will you drink," he asked, "of the Ganges water, infused with wild wood
odours?"

The pilgrim tried to catch him in his words. "What is Ganges? Ganges may
be sand, Ganges may be water, Ganges may be the near bank, Ganges may be
the far bank!"

Said the Bodhisatta to the pilgrim, "Besides the sand, the water, the
hither and the further bank, what other Ganges can you have?" The
pilgrim had no answer for this; he rose up, and went away. When he had
gone the Bodhisatta spake these verses by way of discourse to the
assembled multitude:--

"What he sees, he will not have;  
What he sees not he will crave.  
He may go a long way yet--  
What he wants he will not get.

"He contemns what he has got;  
Once ’tis gained, he wants it not.  
He craves everything always:  
Who craves nothing earns our praise."

\[259\] When this discourse was ended, the Master identified the Birth:
"The vagrant is the same in both cases, and I myself was then the
ascetic."
