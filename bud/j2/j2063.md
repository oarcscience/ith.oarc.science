### KANDAGALAKA-JĀTAKA.

"O friend," etc.--This was told by the Master, during a stay in
Veḷuvana, about Devadatta's attempts to imitate him <span
id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_100.md). When he heard of these attempts to
imitate him, the Master said, "This is not the first time Devadatta has
destroyed himself by imitating me; the same thing happened before." Then
he told this story.

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta
entered into life as a Woodpecker. In a wood of acacia trees he lived,
and his name was Khadiravaniya, the Bird of the Acacia Wood. He had a
comrade named Kandagalaka, or Eatbulb, who got his food in a wood full
of good fruit.

One day the friend went to visit Khadiravaniya. "My friend is come!"
thought Khadiravaniya; and he led him into the acacia wood, and pecked
at the tree-trunks until the insects came out, which he gave to his
friend. As each was given him, the friend pecked it up, and ate it, as
if it were a honey cake. As he ate, pride arose in his heart. \[163\]
"This bird is a woodpecker," thought he, "and so am I. What need for me
to be fed by him? I will get nay own food in this acacia wood!" So he
said to Khadiravaniya,

"Friend, don't trouble yourself,--I will get my own food in the acacia
wood."

Then said the other, "You belong to a tribe of birds which finds its
food in a forest of pithless silk-cotton trees, and trees that bear
abundant fruit; but the acacia is full of pith, and hard. Please do not
do so!"

"What!" said Kandagalaka--"am I not a woodpecker?" And he would not
listen, but pecked at an acacia trunk. In a moment his beak snapped off,
and his eyes bade fair to fall out of his head, and his head split. So
not being able to hold fast to the tree, he fell to the ground,
repeating the first verse:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O friend, what is this thorny, cool-leaved tree  
Which at one blow has broke my beak for me?"</span>

</div>

Having heard this, Khadiravaniya recited the second stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"This bird was good for rotten wood  
And soft; but once he tried,  
By some ill hap, hard trees to tap;  
And broke his skull, and died."</span>

</div>

\[164\] So said Khadiravaniya; and added, "O Kandagalaka, the tree where
you broke your head is hard and strong!" But the other perished then and
there.

When the Master had ended this discourse, he identified the
Birth:--"Devadatta was Kandagalaka, but Khadiravaniya was I myself."
