"*Down smitten with a direful illness*," *etc*.--This story the Master
told at Jetavana about a certain man. We learn that there lived at
Sāvatthi a man tormented by jaundice, given up by the doctors as a
hopeless case. His wife and

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

son wondered who could be found to cure him. The man thought, "If I can
only get rid of this disease, I will take to the religious life." Now it
happened that some days after he took something that did him good, and
got well. Then he went to Jetavana, and asked admission into the Order.
He received the lesser and greater orders from the Master, and before
long attained to sainthood. One day after this the brethren were talking
together in the Hall of Truth: "Friend, So and so had jaundice, and
vowed that if he got well he would embrace the religious life; he did
so, and now he has attained sainthood." The Master came in, and asked
what they talked about, sitting there together. \[437\] They told him.
Then he said: "Brothers, this is not the only man who has done so. Long
ago wise men, recovering from sickness, embraced a religious life, and
secured their own advantage." And he told an old-world tale.

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta
was born in a Brahmin family. He grew up, and began to amass wealth: but
he fell sick of the jaundice. Even the physicians could do nothing for
him, and his wife and family were in despair. He resolved that if he
ever got well, he would embrace the religious life; and having taken
something that did him good, he did get well, whereupon he went away to
Himalaya and became a religious. He cultivated the Faculties and the
Attainments, and dwelt in ecstatic happiness. "All this time," thought
he, "I have been without this great happiness!" and he breathed out this
aspiration:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Down smitten with a direful illness, I  
In utter torment and affliction lie,  
    My body quickly withers, like a flower  
Laid in the sun upon the dust to dry.

"The noble seems ignoble, and pure the impure seems,  
He that is blind, all beautiful a sink of foulness deems.

"Shame on that sickly body, shame, I say,  
Loathsome, impure, and full of foul decay!  
    When fools are indolent, they fail to win  
New birth in heaven, and wander from the way."

</div>

\[438\] Thus did the Great Being describe in various ways the nature of
impurity and constant disease, and being disgusted with the body and all
its parts, cultivated all his life the four excellent conditions of
life, till he went to Brahma's world.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

When the Master had ended this discourse, he proclaimed the Truths, and
identified the Birth--many were they who attained the fruition of the
First Path, and so forth--"At that time I myself was the ascetic."
