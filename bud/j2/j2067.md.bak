"*That which can drink*," *etc*.--This story the Master told while
staying at Jetavana, about perfect wisdom.

On one occasion, the Brethren were gathered in the Hall of Truth,
talking of the Buddha's wisdom. "Friend, the Supreme Buddha's wisdom is
great, and wide, cutting, and quick, sharp, penetrating, and full of
resource." The Master came in, and asked what they talked of as they sat
there together. They told him. "Not now only," said he, "is the Buddha
wise and resourceful; he was so in days of yore." And then he told them
a story.

Once on a time, while Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta
came into the world as the son of the court chaplain. When he grew up,
he studied at Takkasilā; and at his father's death he received the
office of chaplain, and he was the king's counsellor in things human and
divine.

Afterwards the king opened his ear to breedbates, and in anger bade the
Bodhisatta dwell before his face no more, and sent him away from
Benares. So he took his wife and family with him, and abode in a certain
village of Kāsi. Afterward the king remembered his goodness, and said to
himself:

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

"It is not meet that I should send a messenger to fetch my teacher. I
will compose a verse of poetry, \[174\] and write it upon a leaf; I will
cause crow's flesh to be cooked; and after I have tied up letter and
meat in a white cloth, I will seal it with the king's seal, and send it
to him. If he is wise, when he has read the letter and seen that it is
crow's-meat, he will come; if not, then he will not come." And so he
wrote on the leaf this stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"That which can drink when rivers are in flood;  
    That which the corn will cover out of sight;  
That which forebodes a traveller on the road--  
    O wise one, eat! my riddle read aright <span
id="fr_106"></span>[1](#fn_106.md)."</span>

</div>

This verse did the king write upon a leaf, and sent it to the
Bodhisatta. He read the letter, and thinking--"The king wishes to see
me"--he repeated the second verse:--\[175\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The king does not forget to send me crow:  
    Geese, herons, peacocks,--other birds there are:  
If he gives one, he'll give the rest, I know;  
    If he sent none at all ’twere worser far <span
id="fr_107"></span>[2](#fn_107.md)."</span>

</div>

Then he caused his vehicle to be made ready, and went, and looked upon
the king. And the king, being pleased, set him again in the place of the
king's chaplain.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This discourse ended, the Master identified the Birth:--"Ānanda was the
king in those days, and I was his chaplain."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_105"></span>[121:1](j2066.htm#fr_105.md) In commenting upon
this line, the Scholiast says: "And those who at that time spoke the
truth, blaming king Bharu for taking a bribe, found standing room upon a
thousand islands which are yet to he seen to-day about the island of
Nāḷikera."

<span id="fn_106"></span>[122:1](j2067.htm#fr_106.md) *Kākapeyya*, both in
Skr. and in Pali, is proverbial for rivers at the flood. For Skr. see
Pāṇini, 2. 1. 33, where some comm. say 'deep,' some 'shallow.' The
scholiast here says: "They call rivers *K*. when a crow standing on the
bank can stretch out its neck and drink." Buddhaghosha, quoted by Rh. D.
in note to *Buddhist Suttas*, *S. B. E.*, p. 178, says the
same.--*Kākaguyha* is corn tall enough to hide a crow; see Pāṇ. 3. 2. 5
and the Kāçikā's comment, with the scholiast's note here.--In the
dictionary of Vacaspati, vol. 2, p. 1846, col. 1, it is said "When the
crow cries *Khare Khare*, a traveller is coming." The schol. here says:
"If people wish to know whether an absent friend is coming back, they
say--Caw, crow, if so-and-so is coming! and if the crows caw, they know
that he will come."--This verse riddles on these three proverbs and
beliefs. \[For part of this note I am indebted to Prof. Cowell.\]

<span id="fn_107"></span>[122:2](j2067.htm#fr_107.md) I am not sure of the
meaning of these obscure lines, but this is the best I can make of it.
The schol. says "When he gets crow's flesh he remembers to send me some;
surely he will remember when he gets geese, etc." The phrase--"Geese,
herons, peacocks," is a reminiscence of the verse quoted in No. 202,
above.
