"*As yonder king goes galloping*," *etc*.--This story the Master told
during a sojourn in Veḷuvana, how Devadatta imitated the Buddha.

The two chief Disciples <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) went to
visit Gayāsīsa <span id="fr_23"></span>[2](#fn_23.md), where Devadatta
imitated the Buddha, and fell; the Elders then both returned, after
delivering a discourse, taking with them their own pupils. On arriving
at Veḷuvana, the Master asked them what Devadatta had done when he saw
them? \[39\] "Sir," they said, "he

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

imitated the Buddha, and was utterly destroyed." The Master answered,
"It is not only now, Sāriputta, that Devadatta came to dire destruction
by mimicking me; it was just the same before." Then at the Elder's
request, he told an old-world tale.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once upon a time, when Videha was reigning at Mithilā in the realm of
Videha, the Bodhisatta became a son of his Queen Consort. He grew up in
due course, and was educated at Takkasilā; and on his father's decease
he inherited his kingdom.

At that time a certain king of the Golden Geese paired with a Crow at
the feeding-grounds, and to them was born a son. He was like neither
mother nor father. All dingy blue-black he was, and accordingly they
gave him Dingy to his name. The Goose-king often visited his offspring;
and he had besides two other sons, geese like himself. These remarked
that he often used to go to the regions where mankind do frequent, and
asked him what should be the reason. "My sons," said he, "I have a mate
there, a Crow, and she has given me a son, whose name is Dingy. He it is
I go to visit." "Where do they live?" they asked. "On a palm-top near
Mithilā in the kingdom of Videha," describing the spot. "Father," said
they, "where men are, there is fear and peril. You ought not to go
there; let us go and fetch him to you."

So they took a stick, and perched Dingy upon it; then catching the ends
in their beaks, they flew over the city of Mithilā.

At that moment King Videha chanced to be sitting in a magnificent
carriage drawn by a team of four milk-white thoroughbreds, as he made a
triumphal circuit of the city. Dingy saw him, and thought he--"What is
the difference between King Videha and me? He is riding in state around
his capital in a chariot drawn by four white horses; and I am carried in
a vehicle drawn by a pair of Geese." So as he passed through the air he
repeated the first stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">\[40\] "As yonder king goes galloping with his
milk-white four-in-hand,  
Dingy has these, his pair of Geese, to bear him over the land!"</span>

</div>

These words made the Geese angry. Their first thought was "Let us drop
him here, and leave him!" But then again they bethought them--"What will
our father say!" So for fear of rebuke, they brought the creature to
their father, and recounted all that he had done. The father grew angry
when he heard it: "What!" said he, "are you my sons' superior, that you
make yourself master over them, and treat them like horses in a
carriage? You don't know your measure. This is no place for you; get you
back to your mother!" And with this censure he repeated the second
stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Dingy, my dear, there's danger here; this is no
place for you;  
By village gates your mother waits--there you must hasten too."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

With this censure, he bade his sons convey the bird to the dunghill
outside the city of Mithilā; and so they did.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This lesson ended, the Master identified the Birth: "Devadatta in those
days was Dingy, the two Elders were the two young Geese, Ānanda was the
father Goose, and I was king Videha myself."
