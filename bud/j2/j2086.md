\[227\] "*The barb is in your back*," *etc*.--This story the Master told
while dwelling in Jetavana, about a backsliding brother.

He was brought into the Hall of Truth, and asked if he were really
backsliding; to which he replied yes. When asked why, he replied
"Because of the quality of desire." The Master said, "Desire is like
two-barbed arrows for getting lodgement in the heart; once there, they
kill, as the barbed arrows killed the crocodile." Then he told them an
old-world tale.

Once upon a time, the Bodhisatta was king of Benares, and a good king he
was. One day he entered his park, and came to the side of a lake. And
those who were clever with dance and song began to dance and to sing.
The fish and tortoises, eager to hear the sound of song, flocked
together and went along beside the king. And the king, seeing a mass of
fish as long as a palm trunk, asked his courtiers,

"Now why do these fish follow me?"

Said the courtiers, "They are coming to offer their services to their
lord."

The king was pleased at this saying, that they were come to serve him,
and ordered rice to be given to them regularly. At the time of feeding
some of the fish came, and some did not; and rice was wasted. They told
the king of it. "Henceforward," said the king, "at the time for

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

the giving of rice let a drum be sounded; and at the sound of the drum,
when the fish flock together, give the food to them." From thenceforth
the feeder caused a drum to sound, and when they flocked together gave
rice to the fish. As they were gathered thus, eating the food, came a
crocodile and ate some of the fish. The feeder told the king. The king
listened. "When the crocodile is eating the fish," said he, "pierce him
with a harpoon, and capture him." \[228\]

"Good," the man said. And he went aboard a boat, and so soon as the
crocodile was come to eat the fish, he pierced him with a harpoon. It
went into his back. Mad with pain, the crocodile went off with the
harpoon. Perceiving that he was wounded, the feeder spake to him by this
stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The barb is in your back, go where you may.  
The beat of drum, calling my fish to feed,  
Brought you, pursuing, greedy, on the way  
Which brought you also to your direst need."</span>

</div>

When the crocodile got to his own place, he died.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

To explain this matter, the Master having become perfectly enlightened
spake the second verse as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"So, when the world tempts any man to sin  
Who knows no law but his own will and wish,  
He perishes amid his friends and kin,  
Even as the Crocodile that ate the fish."</span>

</div>

\[229\] When this discourse was ended, the Master declared the Truths
and identified the Birth:--at the conclusion of the Truths, the
backsliding Brother reached the Fruit of the First Path:--"In those days
I was the king of Benares."
