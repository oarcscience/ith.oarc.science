"*A Quail was in his .feeding-ground*," *etc*.--This story the Master
told at Jetavana, about his meaning in the Bird Preaching <span
id="fr_35"></span>[2](#fn_35.md).

One day the Master called the Brethren, saying, "When you seek alms,
Brethren, keep each to your own district." And repeating that sutta from
the Mahāvagga which suited the occasion, \[39\] he added, "But wait a
moment: aforetime others even in the form of animals refused to keep to
their own

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

districts, and by poaching on other people's preserves, they fell into
the way of their enemies, and then by their own intelligence and
resource got free from the hands of their enemies." With these words he
related an old story.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta
came into the world as a young Quail. He got his food in hopping about
over the clods left after ploughing.

One day he thought he would leave his feeding ground and try another; so
off he flew to the edge of a forest. As he picked up his food there, a
Falcon spied him, and attacking him fiercely, he caught him fast.

Held prisoner by this Falcon, our Quail made his moan: "Ah! how very
unlucky I am! how little sense I have! I'm poaching on some one else's
preserves! O that I had kept to my own place, where my fathers were
before me! then this Falcon would have been no match for me, I mean if
he had come to fight!"

"Why, Quailie, says the Falcon, "what's your own ground, where your
fathers fed before you?"

"A ploughed field all covered with clods!"

At this the Falcon, relaxing his strength, let go. "Off with you, Quail!
You won't escape me, even there!"

The Quail flew back and perched on an immense clod, and there he stood,
calling--"Come along now, Falcon!"

Straining every nerve, poising both wings, down swooped the Falcon
fiercely upon our Quail, "Here he comes with a vengeance!" thought the
Quail; and as soon as he saw him in full career, just turned over and
let him strike full against the clod of earth. The Falcon could not stop
himself, and struck his breast against the earth; this broke his heart,
and he fell dead with his eyes starting out of his head.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[60\] When this tale had been told, the Master added, "Thus you see,
Brethren, how even animals fall into their enemies' hands by leaving
their proper place; but when they keep to it, they conquer their
enemies. Therefore do you take care not to leave your own place and
intrude upon another's. O Brethren, when people leave their own station
Māra <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md) finds a door, Māra gets a
foothold. What is foreign ground, Brethren, and what is the wrong place
for a Brother? I mean the Five Pleasures of Sense. What are these five?
The Lust of the Eye... \[and so on\]. <span
id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37.md) This, Brethren, is the wrong place for a
Brother." Then growing perfectly enlightened he repeated the first
stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A Quail was in his feeding ground, when, swooping
from on high.  
A Falcon came; but so it fell he came to death thereby."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

When he had thus perished, out came the Quail, exclaiming, "I have seen
the back of my enemy!" and perching upon his enemy's breast, he gave
voice to his exultation in the words of the second stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Now I rejoice at my success: a clever plan I
found  
To rid me of my enemy by keeping my own ground."</span>

</div>

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This discourse at an end, the Master declared the Truths and identified
the Birth:--At the conclusion of the Truths many Brethren were
established in the Paths or their Fruition:---"Devadatta was the Falcon
of those days, and the Quail was I myself."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_35"></span>[40:2](j2021.htm#fr_35.md) I have not been able to
trace this *Sakuṇovāda-sutta*. Perhaps it refers to a speech of the
Buddha as a bird; cp. *Kukkurovādo* i. p. 178 (Pāli).

<span id="fn_36"></span>[41:1](j2021.htm#fr_36.md) Māra is Death, and is
used by Buddha for the Evil One.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[41:2](j2021.htm#fr_37.md) The passage is corrupt.
We must read 'cakkhu-*ādi-viññeyā*.'
