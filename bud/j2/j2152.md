\[447\] "*Aforetime you were used*," *etc*.--This story the Master told
in Pubbārāma, about some Brethren who were rude and rough in their
manners. These Brethren, who lived on the floor below that where the
Master was, talked of what they had seen and heard, and were quarrelsome
and abusive. The Master called Mahāmoggallāna to him, and bade him go
startle them. The Elder rose in the air, and just touched the foundation
of the house with his great toe. It shook to the furthest edge of ocean!
The Brothers were frightened to death, and came and stood outside. Their
rough behaviour became known among the Brethren. One day they got to
talking about it in the Hall of Truth. "Friend, there are some Brethren
who have retired to this house of salvation, who are rough and rude;
they do not see the impermanence, sorrow and unreality of the world, nor
do their duty." The Master came in, and asked what they were discussing
as they sat there. They told him. "This is not the first time,
Brethren," said he, "that they have been rough and rude. They were the
same before." And he told them an old-world tale.

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta reigned king in Benares, the
Bodhisatta was born as a brahmin's son in a village. They named him
Komāyaputta. By and bye he went out and embraced the religious life in
the region of Himalaya. There were some frivolous ascetics who had made
a hermitage in that region, and there they lived. But they did not take
the means to induce religious ecstasy. They fetched the fruits from the
woods, to eat; then they spent the time laughing and joking together.
They had a monkey, rude-mannered like themselves, which gave them
endless amusement by his grimaces and antics.

Long they lived in this place, till they had to go amongst men again to
get salt and condiments. After they went away, the Bodhisatta lived in
their dwelling-place. The monkey played his pranks for him as he had
done for the others. The Bodhisatta snapt his fingers at him, and gave
him a lecture, saying, "One who lives with well-trained ascetics \[448\]

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

ought to behave properly, ought to be well-advised in his actions, and
devoted to meditation." After that, the monkey was always virtuous and
well-behaved.

After this, the Bodhisatta moved away. The other ascetics returned with
their salt and condiments. But the monkey no longer played his pranks
for them. "What's this, my friend?" they asked. "Why don't you make
sport, as you used to do?" One of them repeated the first stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Aforetime you were used to play  
Where in this hut we hermits stay.  
O monkey! as a monkey do;  
When you are good we love not you."</span>

</div>

On hearing this, the Monkey repeated the second stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"All perfect wisdom by the word  
Of wise Komāya I have heard.  
Think me not now as I was late  
Now ’tis my love to meditate."</span>

</div>

Hereupon the anchorite repeated the third:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If seed upon the rock you sow,  
Though rain should fall, it' will not grow.  
You may hear perfect wisdom still;  
But meditate you never will."</span>

</div>

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[449\] When the Master had ended this discourse, he declared the
Truths, and identified the Birth: "At that time these Brothers were the
frivolous anchorites, but Komāyaputta was I myself."
