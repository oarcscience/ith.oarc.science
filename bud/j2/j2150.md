"*O bird, that fliest*," *etc*.--This story the Master told at Jetavana,
about a man who pined for his former wife. The circumstances which
called it forth are <span id="fr_234"></span>[2](#fn_233.md) explained in
the Puppharatta Birth-tale <span id="fr_235"></span>[3](#fn_234.md), and
the tale of the past in the Indriya Birth-tale <span
id="fr_236"></span>[4](#fn_235.md).

So the man was impaled alive. As he hung there, he looked up and saw a
crow flying through the air; and, nought reeking of the hitter pain, he
hailed the crow, to send a message to his dear wife, repeating these
verses following:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"O bird, that fliest in the sky!  
O winged bird, that fliest high!  
Tell my wife, with thighs so fair:  
Long will seem the time to her.

"She knows not sword and spear are set:  
Full wroth and angry she will fret.  
That is my torment and my fear,  
And not that I am hanging here.

"My lotus-mail I have put by,  
And jewels in my pillow lie,  
And soft Benares cloth beside.  
With wealth let her be satisfied."

</div>

\[444\] With these lamentations, he died.

When the Mister had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths, and
identified the Birth (now at the conclusion of the Truths, the lovesick
brother attained the fruition of the First Path): "The wife then was the
wife now; but the spirit who saw this, was I myself."
