### TIṆḌUKA-JĀTAKA.

"*All around us see them stand*," *etc*.--This is a story told by the
Master whilst at Jetavana, about perfect knowledge. As in the Mahābodhi
Birth <span id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md), and the Ummagga Birth <span
id="fr_47"></span>[2](#fn_47.md), on hearing his own knowledge praised, he
remarked, "Not this once only is the Buddha wise, but wise he was before
and fertile in all resource;" and told the following old story.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta
was born as a Monkey, and with a troop of eighty thousand monkeys he
lived in Himalaya. Not far off was a village, sometimes inhabited and
sometimes empty. And in the midst of this village was a tiṇḍuka <span
id="fr_48"></span>[3](#fn_48.md) tree, with sweet fruit, covered with twigs
and branches. When the place was empty, all the monkeys used to go
thither and eat the fruit.

Once, in the fruit time, the village was full of people, a bamboo
palisade set about it, and the gates guarded. And this tree \[77\] stood
with all its boughs bending beneath the weight of the fruit. The monkeys
began to wonder: "There's such and such a village, where we used to get
fruit to eat. I wonder has that tree fruit upon it or no; are the people
there or no?" At last they sent a scout monkey to spy. He found that
there was fruit on the tree, and the village was crammed with people.
When the monkeys heard that there was fruit on the tree, they determined
to get that sweet fruit to eat; and waxing bold, a crowd of them went
and told their chief. The chief asked was the village full or empty;
full, they said. "Then you must not go," said he, "because men are very
deceitful." "But, Sire, we'll go at midnight, when everybody is fast
asleep, and then eat!" So this great company obtained leave o great
their chief, and came down from the mountains, and waited on a hard by
until the people retired to rest; in the middle watch, when people were
asleep, they climbed the tree and began eating of the fruit.

A man had to get up in the night for some necessary purpose; he went out
into the village, and there he saw the monkeys. At once he gave the
alarm; out the people came, armed with bow and quiver, or holding any

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

sort of weapon that came to hand, sticks, or lumps of earth, and
surrounded the tree; "when dawn comes," thought they, "we have them!"

The eighty thousand monkeys saw these people, and were scared to death.
Thought they, "No help have we but our Chief only;" so to him they came,
and recited the first stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"All around us see them stand, warriors armed with
bow and quiver,  
All around us, sword in hand: who is there who can deliver?"</span>

</div>

\[78\] At this the monkey Chief answered: "Fear not; human beings have
plenty to do. It is the middle watch now; there they stand,
thinking--'We'll kill them!' but we will find some other business to
hinder this business of theirs." And to console the Monkeys he repeated
the second stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Men have many things to do; something will disperse
the meeting;  
See what still remains for you; eat, while fruit is left for
eating."</span>

</div>

The Great Being comforted the monkey troop. If they had not had this
crumb of comfort they would have broken their hearts and perished. When
the Great Being had consoled the monkeys, he cried, "Assemble all the
monkeys together!" But in assembling them, there was one they could not
find, his nephew, a monkey named Senaka. So they told him that Senaka
was not among the troop. "If Senaka is not here," said he, "have no
fear; he will find a way to help you."

Now at the time when the troop sallied forth, Senaka had been asleep.
Later he awoke, and could not see any body about. So he followed their
tracks, and by and bye he saw all the people hastening up. "Some danger
for our troop," thought he. Just then he spied, in a hut on the
outskirts of the village, an old woman, fast asleep, before a lighted
fire. And making as though he were a village child going out to the
fields, Senaka seized a firebrand, \[79\] and standing well to windward,
set light to the village. Then did every man leave the monkeys, and
hurried up to quench the fire. So the monkeys scampered away, and each
brought one fruit for Senaka.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

When this discourse came to an end, the Master identified the Birth:
"Mahānāma Sakka was the nephew Senaka of those days; Buddha's followers
were the monkey troop; and I myself was their Chief."
