"*Tis hard to do as good men do*," *etc*.--This story the Master told
whilst in Jetavana, about alms given in common. Two friends at Sāvatthi,
young men of good position, made a collection, providing all the
necessaries to give the Buddha and his followers. They invited them all,
provided bounty for seven days, and on the seventh presented them with
all their requisites. The eldest of these saluted the Master, and said,
sitting beside him, "Sir, amongst the givers some gave much and some
gave little; but let it bear much fruit for all alike." Then he offered
the gift. The Master's reply was: "In giving these things to the Buddha
and his followers, you, my lay friends, have done a great deed. In days
of old wise men gave their bounty thus, and thus offered their gifts."
Then at his request he told a story.

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta
was born into a brahmin family of Kāsi. When he grew up, he was
thoroughly educated at Takkasilā; after which he renounced the world,
and took up the religious life, and with a band of disciples went to
live in Himalaya. There he lived a long time.

Once having need to procure salt and seasoning, he went on pilgrimage
through the country-side, and in course of it he arrived at Benares.
There he settled in the king's park; and on the following morning he and
his company went a-begging to some village outside the gates. The people
gave him alms. Next day he sought alms in the city. The people were all
glad to give him their alms. They clubbed together and made a
collection; and provided plenty for the band of anchorites. After the
presentation their spokesman offered his gift with the same words as
above. The Bodhisatta replied, "Friend, where faith <span

thanks in these verses following: \[86\]

"’Tis hard to do as good men do, to give as they can give,  
Bad men can hardly imitate the life which good men live.

"And so, when good and evil go to pass away from earth,  
The bad are born in hell below, in heaven the good have birth."

</div>

This was his thanksgiving. He remained in the place for the four months
of the rains, and then returned to Himalaya; where he practised all the
modes of holy meditation, and without a single interruption continued in
them until he joined the hosts of heaven.

When this discourse came to an end the Master identified the Birth: "At
that time," said he, "the Buddha's company was the body of ascetics, and
I myself was their leader."
