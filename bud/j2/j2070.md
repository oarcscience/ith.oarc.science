"*All the world's on pleasure bent*," *etc*.--This story the Master
told, while dwelling at Jetavana, about a greengrocer who was a
lay-brother.

The circumstances have been already given in the First Book <span
id="fr_110"></span>[1](#fn_110). Here again the Master asked him where
he had been so long; and he replied, "My daughter, Sir, is always
smiling. After testing her, I gave her in marriage to a young gentleman.
As this had to be done, I had no opportunity of paying you a visit." To
this the Master answered, "Not now only is your daughter virtuous, but
virtuous she was in days of yore; and as you have tested her now, so you
tested her in those days." And at the man's request he told an old-world
tale.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta
was a tree-spirit.

This same pious greengrocer took it into his head to test his daughter.
He led her into the woods, \[180\] and seized her by the hand, making as
though he had conceived a passion for her. And as she cried out in woe,
he addressed her in the words of the first stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"All the world's on pleasure bent;  
Ah, my baby innocent!  
Now I've caught you, pray don't cry;  
As the town does, so do I."</span>

</div>

When she heard it, she answered, "Dear Father, I ant a maid, and I know
not the ways of sin:" and weeping she uttered the second stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"He that should keep me safe from all distress,  
The same betrays me in my loneliness;  
My father, who should be my sure defence,  
Here in the forest offers violence."</span>

</div>

And the greengrocer, after testing his daughter thus, took her home, and
gave her in marriage to a young man. Afterwards he passed away according
to his deeds.

When the Master had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and
identified the Birth:--at the end of the Truths the greengrocer entered
on the Fruit of the First Path:--"In those days, father and daughter
were the snore as now, and the tree-spirit that saw it all was I
myself."
