"*Virūpakkha snakes I love*," *etc*.--This story the Master told whilst
living at Jetavana, about a certain brother.

As he sat, we are told, at the door of his living room, chopping sticks,
a snake crept out of a rotten log, and bit his toe; he died on the spot.
All the monastery learnt how he had come by his sudden death. In the
Hall of Truth

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

they began talking about it; saying how Brother So-and-so was sitting at
his door, chopping wood, when a snake bit him, and he died immediately
of the bite.

\[145\] The Master came in, and wanted to know what they were discussing
as they sat there together. They told him. Said he, "Brethren, if our
brother had practised kindness towards the four royal races of serpents,
that snake would not have bitten him: wise anchorites in by-gone days,
before the Buddha was born, by using kindness to these four royal races,
were released from the fear that sprang from these serpents." Then he
told them an old-world tale.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once upon a time, during the reign of Brahmadatta king of Benares, the
Bodhisatta came into the world as a young brahmin of Kāsi. When he came
of age, he quelled his passions and took upon him the life of an
ascetic; he developed the Supernatural Faculties and the Attainments; he
built an hermitage by the bend of the Ganges near the foot of Himalaya,
and there he dwelt, surrounded by a band of ascetics, lost in the
rapture of meditation.

At that time there were many kinds of snakes upon the Ganges bank, which
did mischief to the hermits, and many of them perished by snake-bite.
The ascetics told the matter to the Bodhisatta. He summoned all the
ascetics to meet him, and thus addressed them: "If you showed goodwill
to the four royal races of snakes, no serpents would bite you. Therefore
from this time forward do you show goodwill to the four royal races."
Then he added this verse:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Virūpakkha snakes I love,  
Erāpatha snakes I love,  
Chabbyāputta snakes I love,  
Kaṇhāgotamas I love."</span>

</div>

After thus naming the four royal families of the snakes, he added: "If
you can cultivate goodwill towards these, no snake creature will bite
you or do you harm." Then he repeated the second verse:--\[146\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Creatures all beneath the sun,  
Two feet, four feet, more, or none--  
How I love you, every one!"</span>

</div>

Having declared the nature of the love within him, he uttered another
verse by way of prayer:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Creatures all, two feet or four,  
You with none, and you with more,  
Do not hurt me, I implore!"</span>

</div>

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

Then again, in general terms, he repeated one verse more:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"All ye creatures that have birth,  
Breathe, and move upon the earth,  
Happy be ye, one and all,  
Never into mischief fall <span id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_91.md)."</span>

</div>

\[147\] Thus did he set forth how one must show love and goodwill to all
creatures without distinction; he reminded his hearers of the virtues of
the Three Treasures, saying--"Infinite is the Buddha, infinite the Law,
and the Order infinite." He said, "Remember the quality of the Three
Treasures;" and thus having shown them the infinity of the Three
Treasures, and wishing to show them that all beings are finite, he
added, "Finite and measurable are creeping things, snakes, scorpions,
centipedes, spiders, lizards, mice." Then again, "As the passions and
lusts in these creatures are the qualities which make them finite and
limited, let us be protected night and day against these finite things
by the power of the Three Treasures, which are infinite: wherefore
remember the worth of the Three Treasures." Then he recited this
stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Now I am guarded safe, and fenced around;  
Now let all creatures leave nee to my ground.  
All honour to the Blessed One I pay,  
And the seven Buddhas who have passed away."</span>

</div>

\[148\] And bidding them also remember the seven Buddhas <span
id="fr_92"></span>[2](#fn_92.md) whilst they did honour, the Bodhisatta
composed this guardian charm and delivered it to his band of sages.
Thenceforward the sages bore in mind the Bodhisatta's admonition, and
cherished love and goodwill, and remembered the Buddha's virtues. As
they did this, all the snake kind departed from them. And the Bodhisatta
cultivated the Excellencies, and attained to Brahma's heaven.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

When the Master had ended this discourse, he identified the Birth:--"The
Buddha's followers were then the followers of the sage; and their
Teacher was I myself."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_90"></span>[100:2](j2056.htm#fr_90.md) See *Cullavagga* v. 6
(iii. 75 in Vinaya Texts, *S. B. E.*), where the verses occur again. The
verses partly recur in the 'Bower MS,' a Sanskrit MS lately found in the
<span id="page_101">p. 101</span> ruins of an ancient city in Kashgaria
(see *J. P. T. S.*, 1893, p. 64). The kinds of snakes mentioned cannot
be identified. Snake charms are extremely common in Sanskrit; there are
many in the Atharva Veda.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[102:1](j2056.htm#fr_91.md) All the verses hitherto
given match, and are to be taken together as the "First gāthā." The
other is in a different metre, and is the "Second gāthā."

<span id="fn_92"></span>[102:2](j2056.htm#fr_92.md) For the seven Buddhas,
see Wilson, *Select Works*, ii. 5.
