### No. 279.

### SATAPATTA-JĀTAKA.

"*As the youth upon his way*," etc. This story the Master told in
Jetavana, about Paṇḍuka and Lohita. Of the Six Heretics, two--Mettiya
and Bhummaja--lived hard by Rājagaha; two, Assaji and Punabbasu, near
Kīṭāgiri, and at Jetavana near Sāvatthi the two others, Paṇḍuka and
Lohita. They questioned matters laid down in the doctrine; whoever were
their friends and intimates, they would encourage, saying, "You are no
worse than these, brother, in birth, lineage, or character; if you give
up your opinions, they will have much the better of you," and by saying
this kind of thing they prevented their giving up their opinions, and
thus strifes and quarrels and contentions arose. The Brethren told this
to the Blessed One. The Blessed One assembled the Brethren for that
cause, to make explanation; and causing Paṇḍuka and Lohita to be
summoned, addressed them: "Is it true, Brethren, that you really
yourselves question certain matters, and prevent people from giving up
their opinions?" "Yes," they replied. "Then," said he, "your behaviour
is like that of the Man and the Crane;" and he told them an old-world
tale.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once on a time, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta
was born to a certain family in a Kāsi village. When he grew up, instead
of earning a livelihood by farming or trade, \[388\] he gathered five
hundred robbers, and became their chief, and lived by highway robbery
and housebreaking.

Now it so happened that a landowner had given a thousand pieces of money
to some one, and died before receiving it back again. Some time after,
his wife lay on her deathbed, and addressing her son, said,

"Son, your father gave a thousand pieces of money to a man, and died
without getting it back; if I die too, he will not give it to you. Go,
while I yet live, get him to fetch it and give it back."

So the son went, and got the money.

The mother died; but she loved her son so much, that she suddenly
reappeared <span id="fr_202"></span>[1](#fn_201.md) as a jackal on the road
by which he was coming. At that time, the robber chief with his band lay
by the road in wait to plunder travellers. And when her son had got to
the entrance of the wood, the Jackal returned again and again, and
sought to stay him; saying, "My son, don't enter the wood! there are
robbers there, who will slay thee and take thy money!

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

But the man understood not what she meant. "Ill luck!" said he, "here's
a jackal trying to stop my way!" he said; and he drove her off with
sticks and clods, and into the wood he went.

And a crane flew towards the robbers, crying out--"Here's a man with a
thousand pieces in his hand! Kill him, and take them!" The young fellow
did not know what it was doing, so he thought, "Good luck! here's a
lucky bird! now there is a good omen for me!" He saluted respectfully,
crying, "Give voice, give voice, my lord!"

The Bodhisatta, who knew the meaning of all sounds, observed what these
two did, and thought: "Yon jackal must be the man's mother; so she tries
to stop him, and tell him that he will be killed and robbed; but the
crane must be some adversary, and that is why it says 'Kill him, and
take the money;' and the man does not know what is happening, \[389\]
and drives off his mother, who wishes his welfare, while the crane, who
wishes him ill, he worships, under the belief that it is a well-wisher.
The man is a fool."

(Now the Bodhisattas, even though they are great beings, sometimes take
the goods of others by being born as wicked men; this they say comes
from a fault in the horoscope.)

So the young man went on, and by and bye fell in with the robbers. The
Bodhisatta caught him, and "Where do you live?" said he.

"In Benares."

"Where have you been?"

"There was a thousand pieces due to me in a certain village; and that is
where I have been."

"Did you get it?"

"Yes, I did."

"Who sent you?"

"Master, my father is dead, and my mother is ill; it was she sent me,
because she thought I should not get it if she were dead."

"And do you know what has happened to your mother now?"

"No, master."

"She died after you left; and so much did she love you, that she at once
became a jackal, and kept trying to stop you for fear you should get
killed. She it was that you scared away. But the crane was an enemy, who
came and told us to kill you, and take your money. You are such a fool
that you thought your mother was an illwisher, when she wished you well,
and thought the crane was a wellwisher when it wished ill to you. He did
you no good, but your mother was very good to you. Keep your money, and
be off!" And he let him go.

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

When the Master had finished this discourse, he repeated the following
stanzas:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"As the youth upon his way  
  Thought the jackal of the wood  
Was a foe, his path to stay,  
  While she tried to do him good:  
That false crane his true friend deeming  
  Which to ruin him was scheming:

"Such another, who is here,  
  Has his friends misunderstood;  
They can never win his ear  
  Who advise him for his good.

\[390\] "He believes when others praise--  
  Awful terrors prophesying:  
As the youth of olden days  
  Loved the crane above him flying <span
id="fr_203"></span>[1](#fn_202.md)."

</div>

When the Master had enlarged upon this theme, he identified the Birth:
"At that time the robber chief was I myself."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_201"></span>[264:1](j2132.htm#fr_202.md) The word implies a
creature not born in the natural way, but taking shape without the need
of parents.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[266:1](j2132.htm#fr_203.md) The scholiast adds
the following lines:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The friend who robs another without ceasing;  
  He that protests, protests incessantly;  
The friend who flatters for the sake of pleasing;  
  The boon companion in debauchery;--  
These four the wise as enemies should fear,  
  And keep aloof, if there be danger near.</span>
