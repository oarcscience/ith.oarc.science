"*When I was in their cage*," *etc*.--This story the Master told while
dwelling in the Bamboo-grove, about Ajātasattu.

Mahā-Kosala, the king of Kosala's father, when he married his daughter
to king Bimbisāra, had given her a village in Kāsi for bath-money. After
Ajātasattu murdered Bimbisāra, his father, the queen very soon died of
love for him. Even after his mother's death, Ajātasattu still enjoyed
the revenues of this village. But the king of Kosala determined that no
parricide should have a village which was his by right of inheritance,
and made war upon him. Some-times the uncle got the best of it, and
sometimes the nephew. And when Ajātasattu was victor, he raised his
banner and marched through the country back to his capital in triumph;
but when he lost, all downcast he returned without letting any one know.

It happened on a day that the Brethren sat talking about it in the Hall
of Truth. "Friend"--so one would say--"Ajātasattu is delighted when he
beats his uncle, and when he loses he is cast down." The Master,
entering the Hall, asked what they were discussing this time; \[238\]
and they told him. He said, "Brethren, this is not the first time that
the man has been happy when he conquered, and miserable when he did
not." And he told them an old-world tale.

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta
became a Green Frog. At the time people set wicker cages in all pits and
holes of the rivers, to catch fish withal. In one cage were a large
number of fish. And a Water-snake, eating fish, went into the trap
himself. A number of the fish thronging together fell to biting him,
until he was covered with blood. Seeing no help for it, in fear of his
life he slipped out of the mouth of the cage, and lay down full of pain
on the edge of the water. At the same moment, the Green Frog took a leap
and fell into the mouth of the trap. The Snake, not knowing to whom he
could appeal, asked the Frog that he saw there in the trap--"Friend
Frog, are you pleased with the behaviour of yonder Fish?" and he uttered
the first stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When I was in their cage, the fish did bite  
Me, though a snake. Green Frog, does that seem right?"</span>

</div>

Then the Frog answered him, "Yes, friend Snake, it does: why not? if you
eat fish which get into your demesne, \[239\] the fish eat you when you
get into theirs. In his own place, and district, and feeding ground no
one is weak." So saying, he uttered the second stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Men rob as long as they can compass it;  
And when they cannot--why, the biter's bit!"</span>

</div>

The Bodhisatta having pronounced his opinion, all the fish observing the
Snake's weakness, cried, "Let us seize our foe!" and came out of the
cage, and did him to death then and there, and then departed.

When the Master had ended this discourse, he identified the
Birth:--"Ajātasattu was the Water-snake, and the Green Frog was I."
