"*Why are hearts cold*," *etc*.--This story the Master told during a
stay near Sāketa, about a brahmin named Sāketa. Both the circumstances
that suggested the story and the story itself have already been given in
the First Book <span id="fr_133"></span>[3](#fn_133.md).

\[235\]...And when the Tathāgata had gone to the monastery, the Brother
asked, "How, Sir, did the love begin? "and repeated the first stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Why are hearts cold to one--O Buddha, tell!--  
And love another so exceeding well?"</span>

</div>

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The Master explained the nature of love by the second stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Those love they who in other lives were dear,  
As sure as grows the lotus in the mere."</span>

</div>

After this discourse was ended, the Master identified the Birth:--"These
two people were the brahmin and his wife in the story; and I was their
son."
