### § XXI

#### MISCELLANY

290\. <span class="smallcaps">If</span> at the cost of a little joy one
sees great joy, he who is wise will look to the greater and leave the
less.

291\. Whoso seeks his own pleasure by another's pain, is entangled in
hate and cannot get free.

292\. Duty neglected; evil done: the taints of the proud and slothful
wax ever more and more.

293\. But those who are ever pondering the nature of the body, who run
not after evil, who are constant in duty—in these, the vigilant and
wise, taints come utterly to an end.

294\. Having destroyed Mother and Father and two noble Kings, with the
whole Kingdom and its Vizier, innocent goes the Brahmin!

295\. Innocent goes the Brahmin having destroyed Mother and Father and
two Brahmin Kings, and the five Roads and their fierce guardians.

296\. The followers of Gautama are evervigilant; their thought day and
night is set upon Buddha.

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

297-301. The followers of Gautama are ever vigilant; day and night is
their thought set upon the Dhamma, the Sangha, the body, compassion (not
harming), mind-culture.

302\. Hard it is to leave home as a recluse! hard also to live at home
as a householder; hard is the community life; the lot of the wanderer in
the world is also hard.

303\. The faithful, upright man is endowed with (the true) fame and
wealth, and is honoured wherever he goes.

304\. Far off are seen the Holy Ones, like the Himālayas: the unholy
pass unseen as arrows shot in the darkness.

305\. Alone when eating, alone when sleeping, alone when walking, let a
man strongly control himself and take his pleasure in the forest glade.
