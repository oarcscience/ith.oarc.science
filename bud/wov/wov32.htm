<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> following are selections from another book which bears the impress of a very early date, and gives us vivid glimpses of the Buddhist Ideal: the Thera-Ther&#299;-G&#257;th&#257;, or Songs of the Elders and Sisters. <i>The Psalms of the Sisters,</i> Mrs. Rhys Davids' fine translation of the latter portion of this book, is a valuable commentary on the Dhammapada, and reveals the great power of Buddhism (whilst the enthusiasm for Buddha was still alive) over the human heart.</p>  <h4 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sayings Illustrative of the Buddhist</span></h4>  <h4 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ideal</span></h4>  
<p><i>Its asceticism:</i></p>  
<p>"Gold-bedecked and bejewelled, carrying her son upon her hip and followed by attendants, came my wife.</p>  
<p>"Beholding her, the mother of my son, I beheld a snare set by the Evil One [Mara]."</p>  
<p align="right"><i>Thera-g&#257;th&#257;</i><i>,</i> 299.</p>  
<p>"Where a man dwells alone, he is as Brahma; where two dwell, they dwell as gods; where three dwell, it is as a village; where there are more, it is a rabble." (The fewer the safer!)</p>  
<p align="right"><i>Ibid.,</i> 245.</p>  
<p><a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="green">p. 101</font></A></p>  
<p><i>Its stoicism:</i></p>  
<p>"The rain pours gurgling down: alone dwell I in dreadful cave. Yet for me it holds not dread nor fear; I am one who knows them not."</p>  
<p align="right"><i>Ibid.</i> 189.</p>  
<p>"As the elephant calmly endures the battle, so this lean one, with limbs gnarled as tree-trunks, endures the sting of insects as he bathes."</p>  
<p align="right"><i>Ibid.,</i> 243.</p>  
<p>"The cold dark nights of winter chap the skin and freeze the thoughts, O Moghar&#257;ja! What shall the Bhikkhu do?</p>  
<p>"The men of M&#257;gadha have taken in their harvest. I, too, like others who delight in life, will lie down and take my rest in the straw."</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">"Home have I left; for I have left my world!<br> Child have I left, and all my cherished herds!<br> Lust have I left, and Ill-will too is gone,<br> And Ignorance have I put far from me;<br> Craving and root of craving overpowered,<br> Cool am I now, knowing Nibb&#257;na's peace."<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thera-g&#257;th&#257;,</i> 18.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mrs. Rhys Davids'</span> Translation.)</div></p>  
<p><i>Its earnestness:</i></p>  
<p>"Not for sleep is the star-spangled night, but for work to him who is wise."</p>  
<p align="right"><i>Thera-g&#257;th&#257;</i><i>,</i> 192.</p>  
<p>"When disease assailed my body, then my mind awoke and cried, "The sickness is upon me! It is high time to play the man."</p>  
<p align="right"><i>Ibid.,</i> 30.</p>  
<p>"Happy freedom! Happy freedom! Good it is to be freed from three crooked things, from scythe and plough and hoe. There they stand; no use have I for them! Let me meditate again and again; let me lead the strenuous life (of thought)."</p>  
<p align="right"><i>Ibid.,</i> 43.</p>  
<p>"Of yore my mind would wander whither caprice and desire led it. To-day I hold it in check as the mahout can hold with his prod the elephant in rut."</p>  
<p align="right"><i>Ibid.,</i> 76.</p>  
<p>"They who have lost their foothold fall. But they can, if they will, arise again and yet again. I have won up the steep slope: loving what is lovely I have easily attained."</p>  
<p align="right"><i>Ibid.,</i> 62.</p>
