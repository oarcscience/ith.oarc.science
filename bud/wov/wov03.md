### NOTE

<span class="smallcaps">An</span> accurate and sympathetic knowledge of
Buddhism and of the spirit of the Buddha is best got from such a book as
the Dhammapada, which contains the concentrated essence of the religion.
In view of widespread misinterpretation, a literal and accessible
translation of this book, therefore, needs no apology. I have worked at
the translation throughout with my friend Mr. Wagiswara, himself a
Buddhist, and for many years a Bhikkhu; that fact and the appearance of
our translation in this series will vouch for sympathetic treatment in
the rendering. It is notoriously difficult to find the exact English
equivalents of Eastern terms, yet we trust that the spirit has been
truly reproduced, and our version aims rather at accuracy than at
elegance. Great thoughts are best "plain-set," and moreover it is
impossible to reproduce the music of the old slokas of Indian poetry. We
have referred frequently to Dr. Fausböll's Latin version, and
occasionally to Professor Max Müller's edition in "The Sacred Books of
the East." Only where the Sinhalese and Chinese commentaries are really
illuminating have I referred to them in the notes, for which I am
chiefly responsible.
