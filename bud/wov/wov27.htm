<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> elephant is the symbol in Buddhism of endurance and solitary strength.</p>  
<p>320. I will endure abuse as the elephant endures the arrow in the battle: evil is the crowd.</p>  
<p>321. Men lead the tamed elephant into battle; upon his back the king rides: he who is tamed and endures abuse patiently is praised of men.</p>  
<p>322. Noble are the tamed mules; noble the blood-horses of Sindh, and the great elephants of war: better is he who has tamed himself.</p>  
<p>323. Not by bridling them will one journey to the unknown shore (Nirv&#257;na), but by bridling himself.</p>  
<p>324. Dh&#257;nap&#257;lako, the great elephant, is hard to control in the time of rut: he will not taste his food in captivity, but longs after the elephant-grove.</p>  
<p>325. If one becomes a sluggard or a glutton, rolling over in gross sleep like a stall-fed hog,</p>  
<p><a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="green">p. 71</font></A></p>  
<p>again and again does he come to the womb, the foolish one!</p>  
<p>326. This mind of mine would wander in days of old whither desire and lust and caprice led it: now will I control it as a mahout controls the elephant in rut.</p>  
<p>327. Be ye zealous: guard your thoughts. As an elephant sunk in the mud extricate yourselves from the clutches of evil.</p>  
<p>328. If you can find a dutiful friend to go with you, a righteous and prudent man not caring for hardships, go with him deliberately.</p>  
<p>329. If you cannot find such a one, travel alone as a king leaving a conquered realm, or as the elephant in the jungle.</p>  
<p>330. It is better to be alone; there is no companionship with a fool: travel alone and sin not, forgetting care as the elephant in the jungle.</p>  
<p>331. Good are companions in time of need; contentment with thy lot is good; at the hour of death, merit is a good friend, and good is the leaving of all sorrow.</p>  
<p>332. Good is reverence for mother and father: good, too, reverence for recluses and sages.</p>  
<p>333. Good is lifelong righteousness; and rooted faith is good: good is the getting of wisdom, and good the avoiding of sin.</p>
