### § VIII

#### THE THOUSANDS

100\. <span class="smallcaps">Better</span> than a thousand empty words
is one pregnant word, which brings the hearer peace.

101\. Better than a thousand idle songs is a single song, which brings
the hearer peace.

102\. Better it is to chant one verse of the law, that brings the hearer
peace, than to chant a hundred empty songs.

103\. If one were to conquer a thousand thousand in the battle—he who
conquers self is the greatest warrior.

104, 105. Self-conquest is better than other victories: neither god nor
demi-god, neither Mara nor Brahma, can undo the victory of such a one,
who is self-controlled and always calm.

106\. If month by month throughout a hundred years one were to offer
sacrifices costing thousands, and if for a moment another were to
reverence the self-controlled—this is the better worship.

107\. If one for a hundred years tended the

sacred fire in the glade, and another for a moment reverenced the
self-controlled, this is the better worship.

108\. Whatsoever sacrifice or offering a man makes for a full year in
hope of benefits, all is not worth a quarter of that better
offering—reverence to the upright.

109\. In him who is trained in constant courtesy and reverence to the
old, four qualities increase: length of days, beauty, gladness, and
strength.

110\. Better than a hundred years of impure and intemperate existence is
a single day of moral, contemplative life.

111\. Better is one day of wise and contemplative life than a thousand
years of folly and intemperance.

112\. Better one day of earnest energy than a hundred years of sloth and
lassitude.

113\. Better one day of insight into the fleeting nature of the things
of sense, than a hundred years of blindness to this transiency.

114\. Better one day of insight into the deathless state (Nirvāna), than
a hundred years of blindness to this immortality.

115\. Better one day of insight into the Supreme Law, than a hundred
years of blindness to that Law.
