### INTRODUCTION

#### § I

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Dhammapada was accepted at the
Council of Asoka in 240 B.C. as a collection of the sayings of Gautama;
yet it was not put into writing until some generations had passed, and
probably contains accretions of later date.

However that may be, there is no doubt that it breathes the very spirit
of the Teacher, and it has always been used in Buddhist lands as a
handbook of "devotion" or meditation, in whose solemn precepts men hear
the voice of Sakyamuni summoning them to the life of contemplation, of
strenuous mind-culture. The world, it tells them, is without permanence
or purpose, other than that of expiation; the body is "a nest of
disease" and the seat of "desire"; the mind itself is subject to decay,
and capricious, easily led away after false pursuits.

Yet here, in the mind of man, lies his hope of salvation: he may make it
a strong tower of defence. Though the world is out of gear,

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

yet, like the Stoic, he may build within himself a kingdom and be at
peace.

And so the call to "play the man" rings out with sturdy confidence. All
men may attain, if they will, to happiness and serenity, for, with a
modern Stoic, the Buddhist proclaims:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"I am the master of my fate;  
     I am the captain of my soul."

</div>

Gautama then was no thoroughgoing pessimist; that such a nature was
pessimistic at all is due to the age in which he lived. It was the
"sub-conscious mind" of his nation, and not his own brave spirit, that
shut him in to the belief in a ceaseless flux of "becoming," a weary
round of pain and retribution. For, by the sixth century B.C., India had
passed from the sunny paganism of the Rig Veda into a more thoughtful
and more gloomy phase of her religious development.

There were not wanting heroic spirits who offered a way of escape,
urging men to plunge into asceticism or to court the mystic trance.
These were the religious leaders of the day, at whose feet Gautama sat.
Others, the great majority, were not ready for such heroic measures.
They tried to square the gods, and to live unmolested, or to forget all
in the pleasures of sense or the more subtle joys of the intellect.

To Gautama, all alike seemed "to follow

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

wandering fires." How degrading this thraldom to immoral and capricious
gods! How empty and unsatisfying this mysticism when shorn of all
ethical content! Which is more to be pitied, the grasping priest or the
foolish worshipper? Which more deluded, the worldling or the devotee?

To all alike the Dhammapada has a message of warning and encouragement:
to the worldling it holds out the promise of a truer wealth and fame
(75, 303) and a more blessed family life (204-7, 302); to the warrior it
offers a higher "chivalry" (270) and a more heroic contest (103, 104);
to the philosopher a deeper wisdom than much speaking (28, 100, 258); to
the mystic a purer and more lasting bliss (197-200); to the devotee a
more fruitful sacrifice (106 -7); and to the Brahmin a more ennobling
service (§ xxvi) and a more compelling authority (73, 74). It is, in
fact, possible largely to reconstruct the religious life of Gautama's
day from the stanzas of the Dhammapada.

For all classes the Buddha has the same message: the great reality is
character; all else are shadows not worth pursuing, for none of them
strengthens moral fibre, and all alike are tainted with "desire."

Like Socrates, he saw in himself a physician of the soul, and at times
he resorted to surgery to "stab the spirit broad awake," to call men
from superstition on the one hand and materialism

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

on the other. With Epictetus he would have said, "A philosopher's
school, my friends, is a surgery, on leaving which you look to have
felt, not pleasure but pain."

Men needed above all things a moral tonic; there lies the secret at once
of his stoicism and his agnosticism; luxury here, a barren mysticism
there—these were sapping men's strength, and all the energy they could
command was needed in the fight for character. They must strive and
agonise to "cut out desire," to push their way "against the stream," to
cross life's stormy "ocean" and reach the haven of peace. And they must
do it alone, not trusting to priest, or sacrifice, or the help of
Heaven.

For this insistence upon morality to the exclusion of "religion" Gautama
is often labelled "atheist." Nothing could be more unfair: agnostic he
may have been or seemed to be; but his was no irreligious spirit: the
man who scoffs at the "other world" he condemns in uncompromising terms,
and Ethics so lofty as this "Way of Virtue" never emanated from any but
a reverent spirit. It is one of the puzzles of Psychology that so pure a
soul ever stopped short at Ethics; yet we must remember that he was a
reformer, that reformers are apt to be one-sided, and that during long
and painful years he had suffered at the hands of a false "religiosity";
the iron had entered into his soul.

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

"If Buddhists admit neither judge nor creator," says Professor de la
Vallée Poussin, "at least they recognise a sovereign and infallible
justice—a justice of wonderful insight and adaptability, however
mechanically it acts… In my opinion it is a calumny to accuse Buddhists
of atheism: they have, at any rate, taken full cognisance of one of the
aspects of the divine." <span id="fr_0"></span>[\*](#fn_0.md)

Gautama believed above all things in a moral order, which, if it is
inexorable, is also too righteous to yield to sacrificial bribes:

<span class="small">"Not in the sky, nor in mid-ocean, nor in
mountain-cave, can one find sanctuary from his sin… Often do men in
terror seek sanctuary in mountains and in jungles, by sacred groves or
trees: in them there is no safe sanctuary." (*Dhammapada,* 127,
188-9.)</span>

So too the Psalmist cries, "Whither shall I flee from Thy presence? If I
ascend into heaven, Thou art there: if I go down to hell, Thou art there
also."

Like the Hebrew prophet, too, he strikes a note of strenuous endeavour,
of profound dissatisfaction with the actual, and of aspiration after the
ideal: unlike the Hebrew and the Christian, he sees in the actual no
promise of the ideal. His "way of salvation" is therefore monastic; men
are to leave the world if they would escape suffering and be truly
happy: the layman may one day attain the far-off goal,

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

but for him remains a long and weary pilgrimage, many revolutions of the
wheel of existence.

It is to Bhikkhus then that these stanzas are in the main addressed.
They are comments made by the Teacher to his disciples as occasion
arose; and to study them in a sympathetic spirit we of the West must for
a time forget our impatience with "cloistered virtue." The saintly life
in the world is no doubt a truer ideal than the saintly life out of it,
yet saintliness of any type is not to be despised.

The Buddhist holds that in contemplative activity a man may best serve
the world: is it not true that "we need reservoirs of every kind of
excellence"? We read in the Dhammapada of the fragrance of holy deeds
which pervades the high heavens, and of the light that such a life may
cast athwart a dark world. The "religious" is more to be envied than
kings or even gods, and more fruitful.

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Good is kingship of the earth;  
Good attaining heavenly birth:  
World-conquest's good, but better far  
The fruits of true conversion are."  
                     (*Dhammapada,* 178.)

</div>

These fruits are "self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control" (*cf.*
261); self-culture is in the end the truest benevolence, says the
Buddhist, and the deepest wisdom. That "wisdom" of which we shall hear
so much in the following

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

pages, is "a certain over-mastering principle or power, that lays hold,
primarily indeed, of the intellect, but through the intellect of the
entire personality, moulding and disciplining the will and the emotions
into absolute unison with itself, a principle from which courage,
temperance, justice, and every other virtue inevitably flow." <span
id="fr_1"></span>[\*](#fn_1.md)

<span class="small">"A man is not wise by much speaking…He is the wise
man who is forgiving, kindly, and without fear."  
(*Dhammapada,* 258.)</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> For Gautama sees
in ignorance not merely a calamity, but also a moral fault; he agrees
with the Darwinians in recognising in man the ape and the tiger, but
adds, with Dr. Creighton, that "when the ape and the tiger go, there
still remains the donkey, a far more formidable beast." <span
id="fr_2"></span>[†](#fn_2.md)

*Mōha,* infatuation, and *Avijjā,* ignorance, are everywhere, and
"Ignorance is the greatest of taints, more destructive than avarice and
impurity." (*Ibid.,* 242, 243.)

He himself was the "enlightened," "the seer" who by insight had won
emancipation, and he teaches that if men will only see things as they
are, then they cannot but eschew evil and do good; but the great
multitude are

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

fools and blind. To give them new ideals and to lift the veil off their
darkened hearts—this was the work of Gautama, and in attempting it he
revealed a sturdy optimism and a magnetic personality which went far to
energise his ideal. These qualities place him high amongst ethical
teachers.

#### § II

And what shall we say of his system as religion? The student of these
pages will find himself in a moonlit world, beautiful yet cold:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"A common greyness silvers everything."

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Here is no "sunset
touch," no mystic hint of Him "whose dwelling is the light of setting
suns"; our hearts are not stirred as we read by any assurance of the
reality of the Unseen.

Mysticism in short finds no entrance here—a fact which makes the
Dhammapada almost unique amongst the great things of religious
literature. Instead we find "common sense" supreme, mathematical, and a
little cold, yet confident of itself and of its firm grasp of all the
factors in life's equation. Instead of passion and romance we shall find
self-mastery and a half-humorous sweet reasonableness. Everywhere Law is
at work, and there is nothing besides: no hint of whence law emanates,
of how it works, or why. These are questions alike

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

unprofitable and unanswerable. It is enough, the Buddha would say, that
the world makes for righteousness, that sin is punished, and that
goodness does not go unrewarded. "As you sow, so shall you reap."
Happiness is the bloom upon virtue; sorrow is the blight upon sin: and
this is the ultimate motive to the strenuous life.

"Is such a world worth while?" asks full-blooded Youth. "And is a calm
like this enough?" "The world," comes the serene answer, "is worth
nothing at all: it has no reality and no purpose, save that of
retribution: man's only happiness is to escape. The calm and peaceful
frame of mind is the only happy one, the promise of a Rest hereafter,
ineffable and placid: to this man can and must attain."
