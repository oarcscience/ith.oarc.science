### § X

#### PUNISHMENT

129\. <span class="smallcaps">All</span> fear the rod, all quake at
death. Judge then by thyself, and forbear from slaughter, or from
causing to slay.

130\. To all is life dear. Judge then by thyself, and forbear to slay or
to cause slaughter.

131\. Whoso himself desires joy, yet hurts them who love joy, shall not
obtain it hereafter.

132\. Whoso himself desires joy and hurts not them who love it, shall
hereafter attain to joy.

133\. Speak not harshly to any one: else will men turn upon you. Sad are
the words of strife: retribution will follow them.

134\. Be silent as a broken gong: so wilt thou reach peace; for strife
is not found in thee.

135\. As the herdsman drives out his cows to the pasture, so Old Age and
Death drive out the life of men.

136\. Verily the fool sins and knows it not: by his own deeds is the
fool tormented as by fire.

137\. He who strikes those who strike not

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

and are innocent will come speedily to one of these ten states:

138\. To cruel torment, loss, accident, severe illness, and madness he
will come:

139\. To visitation from the King, grievous slander, loss of kith and
kin, and perishing of his wealth he will come:

140\. Ravaging fire will destroy his houses, and after death the poor
wretch will go to hell.

141\. Not nakedness, nor matted hair, not dirt, nor fastings, not
sleeping in sanctuaries, nor ashes, nor ascetic posture—none of these
things purifies a man who is not free from doubt.

142\. If even a fop fosters the serene mind, calm and controlled, pious
and pure, and does no hurt to any living thing, he is the Brahmin he is
the Samana, he is the Bhikkhu.

143\. Is there in all the world a man so modest that he provokes no
blame, as a noble steed never deserves the whip? As a noble steed stung
by the whip, be ye spirited and swift.

144\. By faith, by righteousness, by manliness, by meditation, by just
judgment, by theory and practice, by mindfulness, leave aside sorrow—no
slight burden.

145\. Engineers control the water, fletchers fashion their shafts,
carpenters shape the wood: it is themselves that the pious fashion and
control.
