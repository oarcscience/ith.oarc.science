### § XXIII

#### THE ELEPHANT

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> elephant is the symbol in Buddhism of
endurance and solitary strength.

320\. I will endure abuse as the elephant endures the arrow in the
battle: evil is the crowd.

321\. Men lead the tamed elephant into battle; upon his back the king
rides: he who is tamed and endures abuse patiently is praised of men.

322\. Noble are the tamed mules; noble the blood-horses of Sindh, and
the great elephants of war: better is he who has tamed himself.

323\. Not by bridling them will one journey to the unknown shore
(Nirvāna), but by bridling himself.

324\. Dhānapālako, the great elephant, is hard to control in the time of
rut: he will not taste his food in captivity, but longs after the
elephant-grove.

325\. If one becomes a sluggard or a glutton, rolling over in gross
sleep like a stall-fed hog,

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

again and again does he come to the womb, the foolish one!

326\. This mind of mine would wander in days of old whither desire and
lust and caprice led it: now will I control it as a mahout controls the
elephant in rut.

327\. Be ye zealous: guard your thoughts. As an elephant sunk in the mud
extricate yourselves from the clutches of evil.

328\. If you can find a dutiful friend to go with you, a righteous and
prudent man not caring for hardships, go with him deliberately.

329\. If you cannot find such a one, travel alone as a king leaving a
conquered realm, or as the elephant in the jungle.

330\. It is better to be alone; there is no companionship with a fool:
travel alone and sin not, forgetting care as the elephant in the jungle.

331\. Good are companions in time of need; contentment with thy lot is
good; at the hour of death, merit is a good friend, and good is the
leaving of all sorrow.

332\. Good is reverence for mother and father: good, too, reverence for
recluses and sages.

333\. Good is lifelong righteousness; and rooted faith is good: good is
the getting of wisdom, and good the avoiding of sin.
