### § XXV

#### THE BHIKKHII

360\. <span class="smallcaps">Good</span> is restraint of eye and ear:
of smell and taste.

361\. Good is restraint of action and of speech; restraint of mind and
of every sense is good. The Bhikkhu restrained in all things casts aside
every care.

362\. Best amongst the temperate is he who is temperate in hand and foot
and tongue: the man of inward joy and calm, him I call Bhikkhu.

363\. The Bhikkhu who is temperate and moderate in speech, not puffed
up, but a wise preacher and interpreter—sweet are his words!

364\. He who abides in the law and takes his pleasure therein, revolving
it in his mind and pondering it, he is a Bhikkhu who falls not away from
the Law.

365\. Let him neither make much of his own gain, nor envy that of
others: the Bhikkhu who envies others attains not the true meditation.

366\. Even the gods praise that Bhikkhu whose

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

own gain is slight, yet who covets not the gain of other men, but lives
pure and strenuous.

367\. He who clings not to self-hood and to existence, but mourns at the
vanity of this fleeting world, he is called Bhikkhu.

368\. The Bhikkhu who lives kindly and trusts in Buddha's Teaching he
approaches Nirvāna, the calm and blissful end of rebirth.

369\. Bale out the ship, O Bhikkhu, then will it go lightly; cut the
thongs of lust and hate; so wilt thou come to Nirvāna.

370\. Cut the five bonds, leave other five, and take in their place five
more: he who has got beyond the five evil states is said to have crossed
the flood.

371\. Keep vigil, O Bhikkhu, be not slothful, let not your mind dally
with delights: suffer not the pangs of hell, and wail not as the flames
devour you, "O day of woe"!

372\. There is no meditation apart from wisdom; there is no wisdom apart
from meditation. Those in whom wisdom and meditation meet are not far
from Nirvāna.

373\. Divine pleasure is his who enters into solitude, the Bhikkhu who
is calmed and sees the law with the seeing eye:

374\. Whenever he ponders the beginning and the end of the elements of
being, he finds joy and bliss; nectar it is to those who know.

375\. This is the beginning in my teaching for

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

a wise Bhikkhu; self-mastery, contentment, and control by the precepts:
to cultivate those who are noble, righteous, and zealous friends;

376\. To be hospitable and courteous, this is to be glad and to make an
end of sorrow.

377\. As jasmine sheds its withered blossoms so, O Bhikkhus, do you put
away lust and hatred.

378\. He who is controlled in act, in speech, in thought, and altogether
calmed, having purged away worldliness, that Bhikkhu is called calm.

379\. Come, rouse thyself! Examine thine own heart. The Bhikkhu who is
thus self-guarded and mindful will live in happiness.

380\. Each man is his own helper, each his own host; therefore curb
thyself as the merchant curbs a spirited horse.

381\. The glad Bhikkhu who puts his trust in Buddha's Preaching goes to
Nirvāna, calm and blissful end of rebirth.

382\. Let the young Bhikkhu apply himself to Buddha's Preaching: so will
he light up the world as the moon escaped from the clouds.
