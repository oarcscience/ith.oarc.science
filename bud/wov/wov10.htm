<p>76. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Look</span> upon him who shows you your faults as a revealer of treasure: seek his company who checks and chides you, the sage who is wise in reproof: it fares well and not ill with him who seeks such company.</p>  
<p>77. Let a man admonish, and advise, and keep others from strife! So will he be dear to the righteous, and hated by the unrighteous.</p>  
<p>78. Avoid bad friends, avoid the company of the evil: seek after noble friends and men of lofty character.</p>  
<p>79. He who drinks in the law lives glad, for his mind is serene: in the law preached by the Noble the sage ever finds his joy.</p>  
<p>80. Engineers control the water; fletchers straighten the arrow; carpenters fashion their wood. Sages control and fashion themselves.</p>  
<p>81. As some massive rock stands unmoved by the storm-wind, so the wise stand unmoved by praise or blame.</p>  
<p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="green">p. 33</font></A></p>  
<p>82. As a deep lake, clear and undefiled, so are sages calmed by hearing the law.</p>  
<p>83. Freely go the righteous; the holy ones do not whine and pine for lusts; unmoved by success or failure, the wise show no change of mood.</p>  
<p>84. Desire not a son for thyself nor for another, nor riches nor a kingdom; desire not thy gain by another's loss; so art thou righteous, wise, and good.</p>  
<p>85. Few amongst men are they who reach the farther shore: the rest, a great multitude, stand only on the bank.</p>  
<p>86. The righteous followers of the well-preached law, these are the mortals who reach the far shore. But hard is their journey through the realm of Death.</p>  
<p>87, 88. Leaving the way of darkness, let the sage cleave to the way of light: let him leave home for the homeless life, that solitude so hard to love (Nirv&#257;na). Putting away lust and possessing nothing, let the sage cleanse himself from every evil thought.</p>  
<p>89. They are serene in this world, whose mind is perfected in that clear thought which leads to Arahatship, whose delight is in renunciation, free from taints, and lustrous.</p>
