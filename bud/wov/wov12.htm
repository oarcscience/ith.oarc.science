<p>100. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Better</span> than a thousand empty words is one pregnant word, which brings the hearer peace.</p>  
<p>101. Better than a thousand idle songs is a single song, which brings the hearer peace.</p>  
<p>102. Better it is to chant one verse of the law, that brings the hearer peace, than to chant a hundred empty songs.</p>  
<p>103. If one were to conquer a thousand&nbsp;thousand in the battle&#8212;he who conquers self is the greatest warrior.</p>  
<p>104, 105. Self-conquest is better than other victories: neither god nor demi-god, neither Mara nor Brahma, can undo the victory of such a one, who is self-controlled and always calm.</p>  
<p>106. If month by month throughout a hundred years one were to offer sacrifices costing thousands, and if for a moment another were to reverence the self-controlled&#8212;this is the better worship.</p>  
<p>107. If one for a hundred years tended the</p>  
<p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="green">p. 37</font></A></p>  
<p>sacred fire in the glade, and another for a moment reverenced the self-controlled, this is the better worship.</p>  
<p>108. Whatsoever sacrifice or offering a man makes for a full year in hope of benefits, all is not worth a quarter of that better offering&#8212;reverence to the upright.</p>  
<p>109. In him who is trained in constant courtesy and reverence to the old, four qualities increase: length of days, beauty, gladness, and strength.</p>  
<p>110. Better than a hundred years of impure and intemperate existence is a single day of moral, contemplative life.</p>  
<p>111. Better is one day of wise and contemplative life than a thousand years of folly and intemperance.</p>  
<p>112. Better one day of earnest energy than a hundred years of sloth and lassitude.</p>  
<p>113. Better one day of insight into the fleeting nature of the things of sense, than a hundred years of blindness to this transiency.</p>  
<p>114. Better one day of insight into the deathless state (Nirv&#257;na), than a hundred years of blindness to this immortality.</p>  
<p>115. Better one day of insight into the Supreme Law, than a hundred years of blindness to that Law.</p>
