### § XIX

#### THE RIGHTEOUS

256, 257. <span class="smallcaps">Hasty</span> judgment shows no man
just. He is called just who discriminates between right and wrong, who
judges others not hastily, but with righteous and calm judgment, a wise
guardian of the law.

258\. Neither is a man wise by much speaking: he is called wise who is
forgiving, kindly, and fearless.

259\. A man is not a pillar of the law for his much speaking: he who has
heard only part of the law and keeps it indeed, he is a pillar of the
law and does not slight it.

260\. No man is made an "elder" by his grey locks; mere old age is
called empty old age.

261\. He is called "elder" in whom dwell truth and righteousness,
harmlessness and self-control and self-mastery, who is without taint and
wise.

262\. Not by mere eloquence or comeliness is a man a "gentleman," who is
lustful, a miser, and a knave.

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

263\. But he in whom these faults are uprooted and done away, the wise
and pure is called a gentleman.

264\. Not by his shaven crown is one made a "religious" who is
intemperate and dishonourable. How can he be a "religious" who is full
of lust and greed?

265\. He who puts off entirely great sins and small faults—by such true
religion is a man called "religious."

266\. Not merely by the mendicant life is a man known as a mendicant: he
is not a mendicant because he follows the law of the flesh;

267\. But because, being above good and evil, he leads a pure life and
goes circumspectly.

268, 269. Not by silence (mona) is a man a sage (muni) if he be ignorant
and foolish: he who holds as it were the balance, taking the good and
rejecting the bad, he is the sage: he who is sage for both worlds, he is
the true sage.

270\. A man is no warrior who worries living things: by not worrying is
a man called warrior.

271, 272. Not only by discipline and vows, not only by much learning,
nor by meditation nor by solitude have I won to that peace which no
worldling knows. Rest not content with these, O Bhikkhus, until you have
reached the destruction of all taints.
