<p>157. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">If</span> a man love himself, let him diligently watch himself: the wise will keep vigil for one of the three watches of the night.</p>  
<p>158. Keep first thyself aright: then mayest thou advise others. So is the wise man unblameable.</p>  
<p>159. If one so shapes his own life as he directs others, himself controlled, he will duly control others: self, they say, is hard to tame.</p>  
<p>160. A man is his own helper; who else is there to help? By self-control man is a rare help to himself.</p>  
<p>161. The ill that is begun and has its growth and its being in self, bruises the foolish one, as the diamond pierces its own matrix.</p>  
<p>162. As the creeper overpowers the tree, so he whose sin is great, works for himself the havoc his enemy would wish for him.</p>  
<p>163. Ill is easy to do; it is easy to do harm: hard indeed it is to do helpful and good deeds.</p>  
<p>164. Whoso fondly repudiates the teaching</p>  
<p><a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="green">p. 45</font></A></p>  
<p>of the noble and virtuous Arahats, following false doctrine, is like the bamboo which bears fruit to its own destruction.</p>  
<p>165. Thou art brought low by the evil thou hast done thyself; by the evil thou hast left undone art thou purified. Purity and impurity are things of man's inmost self; no man can purify another.</p>  
<p>166. Even for great benefit to another let no man imperil his own benefit. When he has realised what is for his own good, let him pursue that earnestly.</p>
