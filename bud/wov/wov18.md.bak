### § XIV

#### THE BUDDHA

179\. <span class="smallcaps">Into</span> his victory which is never
reversed there enters no element of weakness; through what fault can you
lead captive the faultless one, the Buddha whose sphere is Nirvāna?

180\. By what fault will you lead captive the faultless Buddha, whose
sphere is Nirvāna? In him are no clinging meshes of desire to lead him
captive.

181\. The gods themselves emulate the truly wise and mindful, who are
busy in meditation and prudent, delighting in the peace of Nirvāna.

182\. Arduous is human birth; arduous is mortal life: arduous is hearing
of the Law: arduous the uprising of Buddhas.

183\. "Eschew all evil: cherish good: cleanse your inmost thoughts"—this
is the teaching of Buddhas.

184\. "Patience and fortitude is the supreme asceticism: Nirvāna is
above all," say the Buddhas. He is no recluse who harms others: nor is
he who causes grief an ascetic (samana).

185\. Hurt none by word or deed, be consistent in well-doing: be
moderate in food, dwell in solitude, and give yourselves to
meditation—this is the advice of Buddhas.

186\. Not by a shower of gold is satisfaction of the senses found:
"little pleasure, lasting pain," so thinks the sage.

187\. The follower of the true Buddha finds no delight even in divine
pleasures: but his joy is in the destruction of desire (tānhā).

188\. Often do men in terror seek sanctuary in mountains or jungles, by
sacred groves or trees;

189\. In them is no safe sanctuary; in them is not the supreme
sanctuary; in them is not that sanctuary whither a man may go and cast
aside his cares.

190\. But he who goes for sanctuary to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the
Sangha looks in his wisdom for the four noble truths:

191\. "Sorrow, the arising of sorrow, the cessation of sorrow, and the
noble eightfold path which leads to their cessation."

192\. Here truly is the sure sanctuary: here is the supreme sanctuary:
here is the sanctuary where a man may go and cast aside his care.

193\. Hard to find is the Exalted One: he is not born in every place:
happy dwells the household into which he, the wise one, is born:

194\. A blessing is the arising of Buddhas, a blessing is the true
preaching. Blessed is the

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

unity of the Sangha, blessed is the devotion of those who dwell in
unity.

195, 196. Immeasurable is the merit of him who does reverence to those
to whom reverence is due, Buddha and his disciples, men who have left
behind them the trammels of evil, and crossed beyond the stream of
sorrow and wailing, calmed and free of all fear.
