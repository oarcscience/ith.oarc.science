### § IX

#### VICE

116\. <span class="smallcaps">Cling</span> to what is right: so will you
keep the mind from wrong. Whoso is slack in well-doing comes to rejoice
in evil.

117\. If one offends, let him not repeat his offence; let him not set
his heart upon it. Sad is the piling up of sin.

118\. If one does well, let him repeat his well-doing: let him set his
heart upon it. Glad is the storing up of good.

119\. The bad man sees good days, until his wrong-doing ripens; then he
beholds evil days.

120\. Even a good man may see evil days till his well-doing comes to
fruition; then he beholds good days.

121\. Think not lightly of evil "It will not come nigh me." Drop by drop
the pitcher is filled: slowly yet surely the fool is saturated with
evil.

122\. Think not lightly of good "It will not come nigh me." Drop by drop
the pitcher is

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

filled: slowly yet surely the good are filled with merit.

123\. A trader whose pack is great and whose caravan is small shuns a
dangerous road; a man who loves his life shuns poison: so do thou shun
evil.

124\. He who has no wound can handle poison: the unwounded hand cannot
absorb it. There is no evil to him that does no evil.

125\. Whoso is offended by the inoffensive man, and whoso blames an
innocent man, his evil returns upon him as fine dust thrown against the
wind.

126\. Some go to the womb; some, evil-doers, to hell; the good go to
heaven; the sinless to Nirvāna.

127\. Not in the sky, nor in mid-ocean, nor in mountain-cave can one
find sanctuary from his sins.

128\. Not in the sky, not in mid-ocean, not in mountain-cave can one
find release from the conquering might of death.
