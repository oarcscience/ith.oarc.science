### § XV

#### BLISS

197\. <span class="smallcaps">O Joy</span>! We live in bliss; amongst
men of hate, hating none. Let us indeed dwell among them without hatred.

198\. O Joy! In bliss we dwell; healthy amidst the ailing. Let us indeed
dwell amongst them in perfect health.

199\. Yea in very bliss we dwell: free from care amidst the careworn.
Let us indeed dwell amongst them without care.

200\. In bliss we dwell possessing nothing: let us dwell feeding upon
joy like the shining ones in their splendour.

201\. The victor breeds enmity; the conquered sleeps in sorrow.
Regardless of either victory or defeat the calm man dwells in peace.

202\. There is no fire like lust; no luck so bad as hate. There is no
sorrow like existence: no bliss greater than Nirvāna (rest).

203\. Hunger is the greatest ill: existence is the greatest sorrow. Sure
knowledge of this is Nirvāna, highest bliss.

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

204\. Health is the greatest boon; content is the greatest wealth; a
loyal friend is the truest kinsman; Nirvāna is the Supreme Bliss.

205\. Having tasted the joy of solitude and of serenity, a man is freed
from sorrow and from sin, and tastes the nectar of piety.

206\. Good is the vision of the Noble; good is their company. He may be
always happy who escapes the sight of fools.

207\. He who consorts with fools knows lasting grief. Grievous is the
company of fools, as that of enemies; glad is the company of the wise,
as that of kinsfolk.

208\. Therefore do thou consort with the wise, the sage, the learned,
the noble ones who shun not the yoke of duty: follow in the wake of such
a one, the wise and prudent, as the moon follows the path of the stars.
