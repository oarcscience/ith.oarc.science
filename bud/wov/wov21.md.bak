### § XVII

#### ANGER

221\. <span class="smallcaps">Put</span> away anger, eschew self-will,
conquer every bond; no suffering touches him who does not cling to
phenomenal existence, but calls nothing his own.

222\. Whoso controls his rising anger as a running chariot, him I call
the charioteer: the others only hold the reins.

223\. By calmness let a man overcome wrath; let him overcome evil by
good; the miser let him subdue by liberality, and the liar by truth.

224\. Speak the truth, be not angry, give of thy poverty to the
suppliant: by these three virtues a man attains to the company of the
gods.

225\. The innocent, the sages, those whose action is controlled, these
go to the eternal state where they know not sorrow (Nirvāna).

226\. All taints pass away from them who are ever vigilant and active
day and night, with faces set towards Nirvāna.

227\. This is an ancient law, O Atula, not the jaw of a day; men blame
the silent and they

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

blame the talker; even the man of few words they blame. No one in the
world gets off unblamed.

228\. There never was, nor will be, nor is there now to be found, one
wholly blamed or wholly praised.

229, 230. But who is worthy to blame him whom the wise praise after
daily scrutiny, who is himself wise and without blemish as a medal of
purest gold? Even the gods seek to emulate such a one; even Brahma
praises him.

231\. Guard against evil deeds: control the body. Eschew evil deeds and
do good.

232\. Guard against evil words; control the tongue. Eschew evil words
and speak good ones.

233\. Guard against evil thoughts; control the mind. Eschew evil
thoughts and think good ones.

234\. The wise, controlled in act, in word, in thought, are well
controlled indeed.
