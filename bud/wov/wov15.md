### § XI

#### OLD AGE

146\. <span class="smallcaps">Where</span> is the joy, what the
pleasure, whilst all is in flames? Benighted, would ye not seek a torch?

147\. Look at this painted image, wounded and swollen, sickly and full

155\. They who have not lived purely nor stored up riches in their
youth, these ruefully ponder, as old herons by a lake without fish.

156\. They who have not lived purely nor stored up riches in their
youth, are as arrows that are shot in vain: they mourn for the past.
