### \[THE PERFECT NET.\]

   I. 1. Thus have I heard. The Blessed One was once going along the
high road between Râ*g*agaha and Nâlandâ{2} with a great company of the
brethren, with about five hundred brethren. And Suppiya the mendicant{3}
too was going along the high road between Râ*g*agaha and Nâlandâ with
his disciple the youth Brahmadatta. Now just then Suppiya the mendicant
was speaking in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, in dispraise of
the Doctrine, in dispraise of the Order. But young Brahmadatta, his
pupil, gave utterance, in many ways, to praise of the Buddha, to praise
of the Doctrine, to praise of the Order. Thus they two, teacher and
pupil, holding opinions in direct contradiction one to the other, were
following, step by

{1. The whole of this Sutta was translated into English by the Rev.
Daniel Gogerly, Wesleyan missionary in Ceylon, in the Journal of the
Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1846 (reprinted by P.
Grimblot in his 'Sept Suttas Pâlis,' Paris, 1876).

2\. Nâlandâ, afterwards the seat of the famous Buddhist university, was
about seven miles north of Râ*g*agaha, the capital of Magadha, the
modern Ra*g*-gir (Sum. p. 35).

3\. Suppiya was a follower of the celebrated teacher Sa*ñg*aya, whose
views are set out and controverted in the next Sutta.}

<span id="p. 2">{p. 2}</span>

step, after the Blessed One and the company of the brethren.

   2. Now the Blessed One put up at the royal rest-house in the
Ambala*tth*ikâ pleasance{l} to pass the night, and with him the company
of the brethren. And so also did Suppiya the mendicant, and with him his
young disciple Brahmadatta. And there, at the rest-house, these two
carried on the same discussion as before.

   <span id="text p. 2">\[2\]</span> 3. And in the early dawn a number
of the brethren assembled, as they rose up, in the pavilion; and this
was the trend of the talk that sprang up among them, as they were seated
there. 'How wonderful a thing is it, brethren, and how strange that the
Blessed One, he who knows and sees, the Arahat, the Buddha Supreme,
should so clearly have perceived how various are the inclinations of
men! For see how while Suppiya the mendicant speaks in many ways in
dispraise of the Buddha, the Doctrine, and the Order, his own disciple
young Brahmadatta, speaks, in as many ways, in praise of them. So do
these two, teacher and pupil, follow step by step after the Blessed One
and the company of the brethren, giving utterance to views in direct
contradiction one to the other.'

   4. Now the Blessed One, on realising what was the drift of their
talk, went to the pavilion, and took his seat on the mat spread out for
him. And when he had sat down he said: 'What is the talk on which you
are engaged sitting here, and what is the subject of the conversation
between you?' And they told him all. And he said:

{1. Ambala*tth*ikâ, 'the mango sapling.' It was, says Buddhaghosa (pp.
41, 42), a well-watered and shady park so called from a mango sapling by
the gateway. It was surrounded with a rampart, and had in it a
rest-house adorned with paintings for the king's amusement.

There was another garden so named at Anârddhapura in Ceylon, to the east
of the Brazen Palace (Sum. I, 131). This was so named, no doubt, after
the other which was famous as the scene of the 'Exhortation to Râhula
starting with falsehood,' mentioned in Asoka's Bhabra Edict (see my
'Buddhism,' pp. 224, 225).}

<span id="p. 3">{p. 3}</span>

   5. 'Brethren, if outsiders should speak against me, or against the
Doctrine, <span id="text p. 3">\[3\]</span> or against the Order, you
should not on that account either bear malice, or suffer heart-burning,
or feel illwill. If you, on that account, should be angry and hurt, that
would stand in the way of your own self-conquest. If, when others speak
against us, you feel angry at that, and displeased, would you then be
able to judge how far that speech of theirs is well said or ill?'

   'That would not be so, Sir.'

   'But when outsiders speak in dispraise of me, or of the Doctrine, or
of the Order, you should unravel what is false and point it out as
wrong, saying: "For this or that reason this is not the fact, that is
not so, such a thing is not found among us, is not in us."

   6. 'But also, brethren, if outsiders should speak in praise of me, in
praise of the Doctrine, in praise of the Order, you should not, on that
account, be filled with pleasure or gladness, or be lifted up in heart.
Were you to be so that also would stand in the way of your
self-conquest. When outsiders speak in praise of me, or of the Doctrine,
or of the Order, you should acknowledge what is right to be the fact,
saying: "For this or that reason this is the fact, that is so, such a
thing is found among us, is in us."

   7. 'It is in respect only of trifling things, of matters of little
value, of mere morality, that an unconverted man, when praising the
Tathâgata, would speak. And what are such trifling, minor details of
mere morality that he would praise?'

   8. '"Putting away the killing of living things, Gotama the recluse
holds aloof from the destruction

{1. These titles occur, in the MSS., at the end of the sections of the
tract that now follows. It forms a part of each of the Suttas in the
first division, the first third, of this collection of Suttas. The
division is called therefore the Sîla Vagga or Section containing the
Sîlas. The tract itself must almost certainly have existed as a separate
work before the time when the discourses, in each of which it recurs,
were first put together.

Certain paragraphs from this tract occur also elsewhere. So in
Ma*ggh*ima I, 179 we have the whole of the short paragraphs; in
Ma*ggh*ima, Nos. 76 and 77, and in Mahâvagga V, 8, 3, we have § 17; in
Ma*ggh*ima II, 3 we have most of § 18; and so on. The whole of this
tract has been translated into English by Gogerly (in Grimblot, see page
1, note), into French by Burnouf (also in Grimblot, pp. 212 foll.), and
into German by Dr. Neumann (in his Buddhistische Anthologie, pp. 67
foll.).}

<span id="p. 4">{p. 4}</span>

of life. He has laid the cudgel and the sword aside, and ashamed of
roughness, and full of mercy, he dwells compassionate and kind to all
creatures that have life." It is thus that the unconverted man, when
speaking in praise of the Tathâgata, might speak{1}.

   'Or he might say: "Putting away the taking of what has not been
given, Gotama the recluse lived aloof from grasping what is not his own.
He takes only what is given, and expecting that gifts will come{2}, he
passes his life in honesty and purity of heart."

   'Or he might say: "Putting away unchastity, Gotama the recluse is
chaste. He holds himself aloof, far off, from the vulgar practice, from
the sexual act{3}."

   9. 'Or he might say: "Putting away lying words, Gotama the recluse
holds himself aloof from falsehood. He speaks truth, from the truth he
never swerves; faithful and trustworthy, he breaks not his word to the
world."

   'Or he might say: "Putting away slander, Gotama the recluse holds
himself aloof from calumny. What he hears here he repeats not elsewhere
to raise a quarrel

{1. This refrain is repeated at the end of each clause. When the Sîlas
recur below, in each Sutta, the only difference is in the refrain. See,
for instance, the translation of [p. 100](dob-03tx.htm#text%20p.%20100.md)
in the text.

2\. Neumann has 'waiting for a gift' which is a possible rendering: but
pâtikankhati has not yet been found elsewhere in the sense of 'waiting
for.' The usual meaning of the word expresses just such a trifling
matter as we have been led, from the context, to expect.

3\. Gâma-dhammâ, 'from the village habit, the practice of country folk,
the "pagan" way.' One might render the phrase by 'pagan' if that word
had not acquired, in English, a slightly different connotalion. It is
the opposite of porî, urbane (applied to speech, below, § 9). Dr.
Neumann misses the point here, but has 'höflich' below.}

<span id="p. 5">{p. 5}</span>

against the people here; what he hears elsewhere he repeats not here to
raise a quarrel against the people there. Thus does he live as a binder
together of those who are divided, an encourager of those who are
friends, a peacemaker, a lover of peace, impassioned for peace, a
speaker of words that make for peace."

   'Or he might say: "Putting away rudeness of speech, Gotama the
recluse holds himself aloof from harsh language. Whatsoever word is
blameless, pleasant to the ear, lovely, reaching to the heart,
urbane{1}, pleasing to the people, beloved of the people--such are words
he speaks."

   'Or he might say: "Putting away frivolous talk{2}, Gotama the recluse
holds himself aloof from vain conversation. In season he speaks, in
accordance with the facts, words full of meaning, on religion, on the
discipline of the Order. He speaks, and at the right time, words worthy
to be laid up in one's heart, <span id="text p. 5">\[5\]</span> fitly
illustrated, clearly divided, to the point."

   10. 'Or he might say: "Gotama the recluse holds himself aloof from
causing injury to seeds or plants{3}.

   He takes but one meal a day, not eating at night, refraining from
food after hours (after midday).

   He refrains from being a spectator at shows at fairs, with nautch
dances, singing, and music.

   He abstains from wearing, adorning, or ornamenting himself with
garlands, scents, and unguents.

   He abstains from the use of large and lofty beds.

   He abstains from accepting silver or gold.

   He abstains from accepting uncooked grain.

   He abstains from accepting raw meat.

   He abstains from accepting women or girls.

   He abstains from accepting bondmen or bondwomen.

{1. Porî. See note above on § 8.

2\. Sampha-ppalâpa. Sampha occurs alone in the Hemavata Sutta, and at
*G*ât. VI, 295; A. II, 23.

3\. Samârambhâ cannot mean 'planting' as Dr. Neumann renders it.}

<span id="p. 6">{p. 6}</span>

   He abstains from accepting sheep or goats.

   He abstains from accepting fowls or swine.

   He abstains from accepting elephants, cattle, horses, and mares.

   He abstains from accepting cultivated fields or waste.

   He abstains from the acting as a go-between or messenger.

   He abstains from buying and selling.

   He abstains from cheating with scales or bronzes{1} or measures.

   He abstains from the crooked ways of bribery, cheating, and fraud.

   He abstains from maiming, murder, putting in bonds, highway robbery,
dacoity, and violence."

   'Such are the things, brethren, which an unconverted man, when
speaking in praise of the Tathâgata, might say.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here ends the Kûla Sîla \[the Short Paragraphs on Conduct\].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   11. 'Or he might say: "Whereas some recluses and Brahmans, while
living on food provided by the faithful, continue addicted to the injury
of seedlings and growing plants whether propagated from roots or
cuttings or joints or buddings or seeds{2}--Gotama the

{1. Ka*m*sa-kû*t*a. The context suggests that ka*m*sa (bronze) may here
refer to coins, just as we say in English 'a copper,' and the word is
actually so used in the 11th and 12th Bhikkhunî Nissaggiya Rules--the
oldest reference in Indian books to coins. The most ancient coins, which
were of private (not state) coinage, were either of bronze or gold.
Buddhaghosa (p. 79) explains the expression here used as meaning the
passing off of bronze vessels as gold. Gogerly translates 'weights,'
Childers *sub voce* has 'counterfeit metal,' and Neumann has 'Maass.'
Buddhaghosa is obliged to take ka*m*sa in the meaning of 'gold pot,'
which seems very forced; and there is no authority for ka*m*sa meaning
either weight or mass. On the whole the coin explanation seems to me to
be the simplest.

2\. Buddhaghosa gives examples of each of these five classes of the
vegetable kingdom without explaining the terms. But it is only the
fourth which is doubtful. It may mean 'graftings,' if the art of
grafting was then known in the Ganges valley.}

<span id="p. 7">{p. 7}</span>

recluse holds aloof from such injury to seedlings and growing plants."

   12. <span id="text p. 6">\[6\]</span> 'Or he might say: "Whereas some
recluses and Brahmans, while living on food provided by the faithful,
continue addicted to the use of things stored up; stores, to wit, of
foods, drinks, clothing, equipages, bedding, perfumes, and
curry-stuffs{1}--Gotama the recluse holds aloof from such use of things
stored up."

   13. 'Or he might say: "Whereas some recluses and Brahmans, while
living on food provided by the faithful, continue addicted to visiting
shows{2}; that is to say,

   (1) Nautch dances (na*kk*a*m*){3}.  
   (2) Singing of songs (gîta*m*).  
   (3) Instrumental music (vâdita*m*).  
   (4) Shows at fairs (pekkha*m*){4}.  

{1. Âmisa. Buddhaghosa (p. 83) gives a long list of curry-stuffs
included under this term. If he is right then Gogerly's 'raw grain' is
too limited a translation, and Neumann's 'all sorts of articles to use'
too extensive. In its secondary meaning the word means 'something nice,
a relish, a dainty.'

2\. Visûka-dassana*m*. This word has only been found elsewhere in the
phrase di*tth*i-visûka*m*, 'the puppet shows of heresy' (Ma*ggh*ima I,
pp. 8, 486; and Serissaka Vimâna LXXXIV, 26). The Sinhalese renders it
wiparîta-dar*s*a*n*a.

3\. Dancing. cannot mean here a dancing in which the persons referred to
took part. It must be ballet or nautch dancing.

4\. Literally 'shows.' This word; only found here, has always been
rendered 'theatrical representations.' Clough first translated it so in
his Sinhalese Dictionary, p. 665, and he was followed by Gogerly,
Burnouf, myself (in 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 192), and Dr. Neumann (p.
69),--and Weber (Indian Literature, pp. 199, 319) seems to approve this.
But it is most unlikely that the theatre was already known in the fifth
century B.C. And Buddhaghosa (p. 84) explains it, quite simply, as
na*t*a-sama*gg*â. Now sama*gg*o is a very interesting old word (at least
in its Pâli form). The Sanskrit sama*g*yâ, according to the Petersburg
Dictionary, has only been found in modern dictionaries. The Pâli occurs
in other old texts such as Vinaya II, 107; IV, 267 (both times in the
very same context as it does here); ibid. II, 150; IV, 85; Sigâlovada
Sutta, p. 300; and it is undoubtedly the same word as samâ*g*a in the
first of the fourteen Edicts of Asoka. In the Sigâlovada there are said
to be six dangers at such a sama*gg*o; to wit, dancing, singing, music,
recitations, conjuring tricks, and acrobatic shows. And in the Vinaya
passages we learn that at a sama*gg*o not only amusements but also food
was provided; that high officials were invited, and had special seats;
and that it took place at the top of a hill. This last detail of 'high
places' (that is sacred places) points to a religious motive as
underlying the whole procedure. The root a*g* ({Greek *ágo*}, *ago*,
whence our 'act') belongs to the stock of common Aryan roots, and means
carrying on. What was the meaning of this 'carrying on together'? Who
were the people who took part? Were they confined to one village? or
have we here a survival from old exogamic communistic dancings together?
Later the word means simply 'fair,' as at *G*âtaka III, 541:

'Many the bout I have played with quarterstaves at the fair,' with which
*G*âtaka I, 394 may be compared. And it is no doubt this side of the
festival which is here in the mind of the author; but 'fair' is
nevertheless a very inadequate rendering. The Sinhalese has 'rapid
movement in dance-figures' (ranga-ma*nd*alu).}

<span id="p. 8">{p. 8}</span>

   (5) Ballad recitations (akkhâna*m*){1}.  
   (6) Hand music (pâ*n*issara*m*){2}.  
   (7) The chanting of bards (vetâla*m*){3}.  
   (8) Tam-tam playing (kumbhathûna*m*){4}.  

{1. These ballad recitations in prose and verse combined were the source
from which epic poetry was afterwards gradually developed. Buddhaghosa
has no explanation of the word, but gives as examples the Bhârata and
the Râmâya*n*a. The negative anakkhâna*m* occurs Ma*ggh*ima I, 503.

2\. Buddhaghosa explains this as 'playing on cymbals'; and adds that it
is also called pâ*n*itâla*m*. The word is only found here and at
*G*âtaka V, 506, and means literally 'hand-sounds.'

3\. Buddhaghosa says 'deep music, but some say raising dead bodies to
life by spells.' His own explanation is, I think, meant to be
etymological; and to show that he derives the word from vi+tâ*l*a. This
would bring the word into connection with the Sanskrit vaitâlika, 'royal
bard.' The other explanation connects the word with vetâla, 'a demon,'
supposed to play pranks (as in the stories of the
Vetâla-pa*ñk*a-vi*m*sati) by reanimating corpses. Dr. Neumann adopts it.
But it does not agree so well with the context; and it seems scarcely
justifiable to see, in this ancient list, a reference to beliefs which
can only be traced in literature more than a thousand years later.
Gogerly's rendering 'funeral ceremonies,' which I previously followed,
seems to me now quite out of the question.

4\. It is clear from *G*âtaka V, 506 that this word means a sort of
music. And at Vinaya IV, 285 kumbhathûnikâ are mentioned in connection
with dancers, acrobats, and hired mourners. Buddhaghosa is here obscure
and probably corrupt, and the derivation is quite uncertain. Gogerly's
guess seems better than Burnouf's or Neumann's. The Sinhalese has
'striking a drum big enough to hold sixteen gallons.'}

<span id="p. 9">{p. 9}</span>

   (9) Fairy scenes (Sobhanagaraka*m*){1}.  
   (10) Acrobatic feats by
*K*a*nd*âlas(*K*a*nd*âla-va*m*sa-dhopana*m*){2}.  
   (11) Combats of elephants, horses, buffaloes, bulls, goats, rams,
cocks, and quails.  
   (12) Bouts at quarter-staff{3}, boxing, wrestling{4}.  
   (13-16) Sham-fights, roll-calls, manreuvres, reviews{5}.--  

   Gotama the recluse holds aloof from visiting such shows."

   14. 'Or he might say: "Whereas some recluses and Brahmans, while
living on food provided by the faithful, continue addicted to games and
recreations{6}; that is to say,

   (1) Games on boards with eight, or with ten, rows of squares{7}.  
   (2) The same games  

{1. Buddhaghosa seems to understand by this term (literally 'of Sobha
city ) the adornments or scenery used for a ballet-dance.
(Pa*t*ibhâ*n*a-kitta*m* at Vinaya II, 151; IV, 61, 298, 358; Sum. I, 42
is the nude in art.) Weber has pointed out (Indische Studien, II, 38;
III, 153) that Sobha is a city of the Gandharvas, fairies much given to
music and love-making. It is quite likely that the name of a frequently
used scene for a ballet became a proverbial phrase for all such scenery.
But the Sinhalese has 'pouring water over the heads of dancers, or nude
paintings.'

2\. Buddhaghosa takes these three words separately, and so do all the
MSS. of the text, and the Sinhalese version. But I now think that the
passage at *G*âtaka IV, 390 is really decisive, and that we have here
one of the rare cases where we can correct our MSS. against the
authority of the old commentator. But I follow him in the general
meaning he assigns to the strange expression
'*K*a*nd*âla-bamboo-washings.'

3\. See *G*âtaka III, 541.

4\. Nibbuddha*m*. The verbal form nibbu*ggh*ati occurs in the list at
Vinaya III, 180 (repeated at II, 10); and our word at Milinda 232.

5\. All these recur in the introductory story to the 50th Pâ*k*ittiya
(Vinaya IV, 107). On the last compare Buddhaghosa on Mahâvagga V, 1, 29.

6\. All these terms recur at Vinaya III, 180 (repeated at II, 10).

7\. Chess played originally on a board of eight times ten squares was
afterwards played on one of eight times eight squares. Our text cannot
be taken as evidence of real chess in the fifth century B. C., but it
certainly refers to games from which it and draughts must have been
developed. The Sinhalese Sanna says that each of these games was played
with dice and pieces such as kings and so on. The worJ for pieces is
poru (from purisa)--just our 'men.'}

<span id="p. 10">{p. 10}</span>

played by imagining such boards in the air{1}.  
   (3) Keeping going over diagrams drawn on the ground so that one steps
only where one ought to go{2}.  
   (4) Either removing the pieces or men from a heap with one's nail, or
putting them into a heap, in each case without shaking it, He who shakes
the heap, loses.  
   (5) Throwing dice{4}.  
   (6) Hitting a short stick with a long one{5}.  
   (7) Dipping the hand with the fingers stretched out in lac, or red
dye, or flour-water, and striking the wet hand on the ground or on a
wall, calling out 'What shall it be?' and showing the form
required--elephants, horses, &c.{6}  
   (8) Games with balls{7}.  
   (9) Blowing through toy pipes made of leaves{8}.  
   (10) Ploughing with toy ploughs{9}.  
   (11) Turning summersaults{10}.  
   (12) Playing with toy windmills made of palm-leaves{11}.  

{1. Âkâsa*m*. How very like blindfold chess!

2\. Parihâra-patha*m*. A kind of primitive 'hop-scotch.' The Sinhalese
says the steps must be made hopping.

3\. Santikâ. Spellicans, pure and simple.

4\. Khalikâ. Unfortunately the method of playing is not stated. Compare
Eggeling's note as in his *S*atapatha-Brâhma*n*a III, 106, 7. In the
gambling-scene on the Bharhut Tope (Cunningham, Pl. XLV, No. 9) there is
a board marked out on the stone of six times five squares (not six by
six), and six little cubes with marks on the sides visible lie on the
stone outside the board.

5\. Gha*t*ikam. Something like 'tip-cat.' Si*m*-kelîmaya in Sinhalese.

6\. Salâka-hattha*m*. On flour-water as colouring matter, see *G*âtaka
I, 220.

7\. Akkha*m*. The usual meaning is 'a die.' But the Sinhalese translator
agrees with Buddhaghosa. Neither gives any details.

8\. Panga*k*îra*m*. The Sinhalese for this toy is 'pat-kulal. Morris in
J. P. T. S., 1889, p. 205, compares the Marathî pungî.

9\. Vankaka*m*. From Sanskrit v*ri*ka. See Journal of the Pâli Text
Society, 1889, p. 206.

10\. Mokkha*k*ikâ. So the Sinhalese. Buddhaghosa has an alternative
explanation of turning over on a trapeze, but gives this also. See
Vinaya I, 275, and J. P. T. S., 1885, p. 49.

11\. *K*ingulika*m*. See Morris in the J. P. T. S., 1885, p. 50, who
compares *k*ingulâyitvâ at A<u>n</u>guttara III, 15, 2.}

<span id="p. 11">{p. 11}</span>

   (13) Playing with toy measures made of palm-leaves.  
   (14, 15) Playing with toy carts or toy bows{1}.  
   (16) Guessing at letters traced in the air, or on a playfellow's
back{2}.  
   (17) Guessing the playfellow's thoughts.  
   (18) Mimicry of deformities.  

   <span id="text p. 7">\[7\]</span> Gotama the recluse holds aloof from
such games and recreations."

   15. 'Or he might say: "Whereas some recluses and Brahmans, while
living on food provided by the faithful, continue addicted to the use of
high and large couches; that is to say{3},

   (1) Moveable settees, high, and six feet long (Âsandi){4}.  
   (2) Divans with animal figures carved on the supports
(Pallanko){5}.  

{1. All these six, from No. 10 inclusive, are mentioned in the
Ma*ggh*ima, vol. i, p. 266, as children's games.

2\. Akkharikâ. It is important evidence for the date at which writing
was known in India that such a game should be known in the fifth century
B.C.

3\. The following list recurs Vinaya I, 192 = II, 163 = A<u>n</u>guttara
I, 181, &c.

4\. Âsandî. Buddhaghosa merely says 'a seat beyond the allowed measure,'
but that must refer to height, as the only rule as to measure in seats
is the 87th Pâ*k*ittiya in which the height of beds or chairs is limited
to eight 'great' inches (probably about eighteen inches). The Sinhalese
Sanna adds 'a long chair for supporting the whole body.' At *G*ât. I,
208 a man lies down on an âsandî so as to be able to look up and watch
the stars. At Dîgha I, 55 = Ma*ggh*ima I, 515 = Sa*m*yutta III, 307
(where the reading must be corrected), the âsandî is used as a bier. The
âsandî is selected as the right sort of seat for the king in both the
Vâ*g*apeya and Inauguration ceremonies because of its height (Eggeling,
*S*at.-Brâh. III, 35, 105). It is there said to be made of common sorts
of wood, and perforated; which probably means that the frame was of wood
and the seat was of interlaced cane or wickerwork. The diminutive
âsandiko, with short legs and made square (for sitting, not lying on),
is allowed in the Buddhist Order by Vinaya II, 149. And even the âsandî
is allowed, if the tall legs be cut down, by Vinaya II, 169, 170 (where
the reading *kh*inditvâ seems preferable, and is read in the quotation
at Sum. I, 88). The renderings 'large cushion' at 'Vinaya Texts,' II, 27
and 'stuffed couch' at III, 209 must be accordingly corrected. Gogerly
translates 'large couch,' Burnouf 'une chaise longue,' and Neumann
'bequeme Lehnstuhl.'

5\. Pallanko. It is noteworthy that, in spite of the use of a divan with
animals carved on its supports being here objected to, it is precisely
the sort of seat on which the Buddha himself, or Buddhist personages of
distinction, are often, in later sculptures, represented as sitting
(Grünwedel, 'Buddhistische kunst,' pp. 111, 124, 137; Mitra, 'Budh
Gayâ,' Plates XI, XX, &c. &c.). At Mahâva*m*sa 25 sîhâsana and pallanko
are used of the same seat (Asoka's throne), and sîhâsana is used of
Du*tth*a Garnini's throne, ibid. 157. But the Lion throne of Nissanka
Malla, found at Pollonnaruwa, is not a pallanko, but an actual stone
lion, larger than life size ('Indian Antiquary,' vol. i, p. 135. Compare
the similar seat in Grünwedel, p. 95).

By Vinaya II, 170 the possession of a pallanka was allowed to the Order
if the animal figures were broken off (the translation in 'Vinaya
Texts,' III, 209, must be altered accordingly, reading vâ*l*e for vale,
as at Vinaya IV, 312). By Vinaya II, 163 it is laid down that members of
the Order were not to use a complete pallanko even in laymen's houses,
so that Nigrodha's action in the passage just quoted (Mahâvamsa 25) was
really a breach of the regulations.}

<span class="small">{1. The words from gonako down to ka*tth*issa*m*
inclusive, and also kuttaka*m*, are found only in this list, and
Buddhaghosa seems to be uncertain as to the exact meaning of some of
them. All except No. 7 might be used in laymen's houses ('Vinaya Texts:
III, 197), and all might be possessed by the Order if used only as
floor-coverings (ibid. III, 209); except again No. 7, the cotton wool of
which might be utilised for pillows. As there is a doubt about the
spelling it may be noticed that the Sanna reads go*n*aka*m* and
uddalomi*m*: and the MS. in the R. A. S. (which repeats each sentence)
has gonaka*m* and uddalomi*m* both times.}</span>

living on food provided by the faithful, continue addicted to the use of
means for adorning and beautifying themselves; that is to say,--Rubbing
in scented powders on one's body, shampooing it, and bathing it. Patting
the limbs with clubs after the manner of wrestlers{1}. The use of
mirrors, eye-ointments, garlands, rouge, cosmetics, bracelets,
necklaces, walking-sticks, reed cases for drugs, rapiers, sunshades,
embroidered slippers, turbans, diadems, whisks of the yak's tail, and
long-fringed white robes--

beautifying the person{2}."

living on food provided by the faithful, continue addicted to such low
conversation as these:

   Tales of kings, of robbers, of ministers of state; tales of war, of

{1. Sambâhana*m*. Perhaps rubbing the limbs with flat pieces of wood.
See Buddhaghosa here and at 'Vinaya Texts,' III, 60.

2\. This is not quite accurate. Out of the twenty items here objected
to, three (shampooing, bathing, and the use of sunshades) were allowed
in the Order, and practised by Gotama himself. Bathrooms, and halls
attached to them, are permitted by 'Vinaya Texts,' III, 189; shampooing
by ibid. III, 68, 297. There are elaborate regulations for the provision
of hot steam baths and the etiquette to be observed in them; and
instances of the use of the ordinary bath in streams or rivers are
frequent. The use of sunshades is permitted by 'Vinaya Texts,' III,
132-3, and is referred to ibid. III, 88, 274.

3\. Visikhâ-kathâ. Buddhaghosa (p. 90) takes this word (literally
'street-talk') in the sense of talk about streets, whether ill or well
situate, and whether the inhabitants are bold or poor, &c.}

<span id="p. 14">{p. 14}</span>

water is fetched; ghost stories{1}; desultory talk{2}; speculations
about the creation of the land or sea{3}, or about existence and
non-existence{4}--

   18. 'Or he might say: "Whereas some recluses and Brahmans, while
living on food provided by the faithful, continue addicted to the use of
wrangling phrases{5}: such as--

   "You don't understand this doctrine and discipline, I do."

   "How should you know about this doctrine and discipline?"

   "You have fallen into wrong views. It is I who am in the right."

   "I am speaking to the point, you are not{6}."

   "You are putting last what ought to come first, and first what ought
to come last{7}."

   "What you've excogitated so long, that's all quite upset."

{1. Pubba-peta-kathâ. The commentator confines this to boasting talk
about deceased relatives or ancestors.

2\. Nânatta-katha*m*, literally 'difference-talk.' The expression seems
somewhat forced, if taken as meaning 'desultory'; but I see no better
explanation.

3\. Lokakkhâyikâ. Buddhaghosa refers this specially to such speculations
as are put forth according to the Lokakkhâyikâ system by the Vita*nd*as
(also called Lokâyatikas). These are materialistic theorisers, of whose
system very little is, so far, known. See the note at 'Vinaya Texts,'
vol. iii, p. 151. I have collected other references to them in my
'Milinda,' vol. i, p. 7; and to these Digha I, 11, 114, 120, and Attha
Sâlinî, p. 3, may now be added. They are probably referred to below in
chap. iii of this Sutta, §§ 10, 20.

4\. This list of foolish talks recurs in Suttas 76-78 in the Ma*ggh*ima,
and at Vinaya I, 188.

5\. These expressions all recur at Ma*ggh*ima II, 3.

6\. Sahita*m* me, literally 'the put together is to me,' &c. The idiom
is only found here, and may mean either as rendered above, or 'the
context is on my side,' or 'the text (of the Scriptures) is on my side,'
or merely 'that which is of use is on my side.' This last, given by the
Sanna, amounts to the same as the version adopted above.

7\. Putting the cart before the horse.}

   "Your challenge has been taken up{1}."

   "You are proved to be wrong{2}."

   "Set to work to clear your views{3}."

   "Disentangle yourself if you can.{4}"--

   Gotama the recluse holds aloof from such wrangling phrases."

   19. 'Or he might say: "Whereas some recluses and Brahmans, while
living on food provided by the faithful, continue addicted to taking
messages, going on errands, and acting as go-betweens; to wit, on kings,
ministers of state, Kshatriyas, Brahmans, or young men, saying: 'Go
there, come hither, take this with you, bring that from thence'--

   Gotama the recluse abstains from such servile duties."

   20. 'Or he might say: "Whereas some recluses and Brahmans, while
living on food provided by the faithful, are tricksters{5}, droners out
(of holy words for pay){6},

{1. Âropito te vâdo. On the use of this idiom compare the Commentary on
the Theri Gâthâ, p. 101. There is a misprint here in the text, aropito
for âropito. 'Issue has been joined against you' would be a possible
rendering. It is the phrase used, when some one has offered to hold
debate (maintain a thesis) against all comers, by an opponent who takes
up the challenge.

2\. Niggahîto si. On this idiom compare the opening paragraphs of the
Kathâ Vatthu and the Commentary on them (especially pp. 9, 10). It is
literally 'you are censured.'

3\. *K*ara vâda-pamokkhâya. So Buddhaghosa. But Gogerly renders,
'Depart, that you may be freed from this disputation;' and the only
parallel passage seems to support this view. It is Ma*ggh*ima I, 133,
where it is said to be wrong to learn the Scriptures for the sake of the
advantage of being freed from discussion or debate where texts are
quoted against one. Pamokkha occurs besides at Samyutta I, 2, *G*âtaka
V, 30, 31, and Mahâva*m*sa 158, but not in this connection.

4\. So the author of Milinda in making his hero Nâgasena use just such a
phrase (Mil. p. 27) is making him commit a breach of propriety.

5\. Kuhakâ. 'Astonish the world with the three sorts of trickery,' says
Buddhaghosa. These are also referred to without explanation at *G*âtaka
IV, 297 (where we should, I think, read kuhana).

6\. Lapakâ. Compare Itivuttaka, No. 99 = A<u>n</u>guttara I, 165, 168;
and also Milinda 228, *G*âtaka III, 349.}

recluses and Brahmans, while living on food provided by the faithful,
earn their living by wrong means of livelihood, by low arts, such as
these:--

   (1) palmistry-prophesying long life, prosperity, &c. (or the
reverse), from marks on a child's hands, feet, &c.{4}  
   (2) Divining by means of omens and signs{5}.  
   (3) Auguries drawn from thunderbolts and other celestial
portents{6}.  

{1. Nemittakâ, 'interpreters of signs and omens.' See the note on
nimitta*m* in the next paragraph. Compare Milinda 299; Gât. IV, 124.

2\. Nippesikâ, 'scarers away' (? of ghosts, or bad omens). But the
Commentary and Sanna give no help, and the word has only been found in
this list.

3\. All the five words in this list recur at A. III, 111, but the
context there is as undecisive as it is here, and the Commentary (fol.
*di* of the Tumour MS. at the India Office), though slightly different,
gives no better help.

4\. A<u>n</u>ga*m*, literally 'limbs.' Buddhaghosa distinguishes this
from lakkha*n*a*m* (No. 5 in this list), and from anga-vi*gg*â (No. 16).
It is not found, in this sense, anywhere in the texts.

5\. Nimitta*m*, literally 'marks,' or 'signs.' Buddhaghosa tells a story
in illustration. King Pa*nd*u, they say (Pâ*nd*i in the Sanna), took
three pearls in his closed hand, and asked a diviner what he had in it.
The latter looked this way and that for a sign; and seeing a fly which
had been caught by a house-lizard (the Sanna says 'by a dog,' perhaps
the meaning is simply 'in sugar') getting free (muttâ), said at once
'pearls' (also muttâ in Pâli). 'How many?' says the king. The diviner,
hearing a dog bark thrice, answered 'three.' Compare Mil. 178, and the
note to the last section on nemittikâ and the story at Mahâva*m*sa 82.

6\. Uppâdo, 'the portents of the great ones, thunderbolts falling, and
so on,' says Buddhaghosa. The Great Ones here mean, I think, the spirits
or gods presiding over the sun, moon, and planets (see the note on §
26). The word corresponds to the Sanskrit Utpâta, though the d is
vouched for by overwhelming authority. But this is only another instance
of a change not infrequent (as Ed. Müller has shown, Pâli Grammar, p.
37); and the one or two cases where Burmese scribes have (wrongly)
corrected to uppâta is another instance to be added to those referred to
in the Introduction to Sum. I of their habit of putting an easier
reading where the more difficult one is really right. Childers should
therefore have kept this word separate from the other uppâdo. Comp.

   (7) Sacrificing to Agni{4}.  
   (8) Offering oblations from a spoon{5}.  
   (9-13) Making offerings to gods of husks, of the red powder between
the grain and the husk, of husked grain ready for boiling, of ghee, and
of oil{6}.  
   (14) Sacrificing by spewing mustard seeds, &c., into the fire out of
one's mouth{7}.  
   (15) Drawing blood from one's right knee as a sacrifice to the
gods{8}.  

{1. Supina*m*. On the theory of dreams compare Mil., pp. 297-301. At
*G*ât. I, 374 the word is masculine. Perhaps charms to avert bad dreams
(Ath.-veda VI, 46; XVI, 5 and 6) are included in this 'low art.' *G*ât.
No. 77 mocks at the dream interpreters.

2\. Lakkha*n*a*m*. The commentator on this word as used in the very same
connection at *G*ât. I, 374 adds that it means also the knowledge of
good and bad marks on such persons and things as are mentioned here in
our next paragraph. Buddhaghosa confines its meaning to that given
above. This contradiction is another confirmation of the opinion
expressed by me in 1880 in 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' pp. lxiii foll.,
that Childers was wrong in ascribing the *G*âtaka Commentary to
Buddhaghosa. The word occurs in Buddhaghosa's sense at D. I, 114, 120 =
A. I, 163, &c.; *G*ât. I, 56.

3\. Musikâ*kkh*inna*m*. The allied superstition of thinking it unlucky
to wear clothes gnawed by mice is laughed out of court in the Mangala
Gâtaka, No. 87.

4\. Aggi-homa*m*. Telling people that a sacrifice, if offered in a fire
of such and such a wood, will have such and such a result.

5\. Dabbi-homa*m*. Telling people that an oblation of such and such
grains, butter, or so on, poured into the fire from such and such a sort
of spoon, will have such and such a result.

6\. See Hillebrandt, 'Neu und Vollmondsopfer,' pp. 31, 171, and
'Ritual-literatur' in Bühler's 'Grundriss,' pp. 71, 72, 114, 176. The
nine homas here objected to may also be compared with the seven at
Ath.-veda VIII, 9, 18.

7\. No instance of this can be traced in the books of the Brahmans.

8\. Compare the passage in Hillebrandt, in Bühler's 'Grundriss,' p. 176,
on the use of blood for sorcery. In one passage, Rig-vidh. III, 18, 3,
it is one's own blood that is to be used. But the specific
interpretation given here by Buddhaghosa cannot be paralleled from the
Brahmanical books.}

<span id="p. 18">{p. 18}</span>

   (16) Looking at the knuckles, &c., and, after muttering a charm,
divining whether a man is well born or lucky or not{1}.  
   (17) Determining whether the site, for a proposed house or pleasance,
is lucky or not{2}.  
   (18) Advising on customary law{3}.  
   (19) Laying demons in a cemetery{4}.  
   (20) Laying ghosts{5}.  
   (21) Knowledge of the charms to be used when lodging in an earth
house{6}.  
   (22) Snake charming{7}.  

{1. Anga-vi*gg*â. Buddhaghosa thus separates this from the
a<u>n</u>ga*m* of No. 1. In both the passages *G*ât. II, 200, 250 the
knowledge is simply that of judging from a man's appearance that he is
rough or bad, and it is the good man in the story (in the second case
the Bodisat himself) who is the anga-vi*gg*â-pâ*th*ako. So at *G*ât. V,
458 it is by anga-vi*gg*â that the Bodisat prophesies that a man will be
cruel.

2\. Vatthu-vi*gg*â. Childers (Dict., p. 559) has 'pool' instead of
'house,' having misread sara for ghara (s and gh are nearly alike in
Sinhalese). The craft is further explained by Buddhaghosa in his comment
on the Mahâ-parinibbâna Sutta I, 26. Its success depended on the belief
that the sites were haunted by spirits. See further below, § 27.

3\. Khatta-vi*gg*â. The Burmese MSS. correct the rare khatta into the
familiar khetta. Khetta-vi*gg*â indeed occurs at Ud. III, 9, and may
just possibly there (in connection with writing, arithmetic, tables,
&c.) be correct in the meaning of 'land-survering, mensuration.'
Buddhaghosa, though his explanation is corrupt, evidently understands
the phrase in a sense similar to that of khatta-dhamma at *G*ât. V, 489,
490; Mil. 164 (see also 178); and his gloss nîti-sattham is probably
nearer the mark than *S*a<u>n</u>kara's (on *Kh*ând. Up. VII, I, 2),
which is dhanur-veda. It is the craft of government, then lying in great
part in adhering to custom.

The Sutta only follows the Upanishad in looking at all these crafts as
minor matters, but it goes beyond it in looking upon them as a 'low'
way, for a Brahman, of gaining a livelihood.

4\. Siva-vi*gg*â. It is clear that siva is used euphemistically, and we
may here have an early reference to what afterwards developed into the
cult of the god *S*iva. Buddhaghosa gives an alternative explanation as
knowledge of the cries of jackals.

5\. Bhûta-vi*gg*â. Also in the *Kh*ândogya list (*loc. cit.*).

6\. Bhûri-vi*gg*â. It is the same as bhûri-kamma*m*, explained in the
same way by Buddhaghosa on § 27 below.

7\. Ahi-vi*gg*â. One method is described at *G*ât. IV, 457, 8. Perhaps
such charms against snake bite as Ath.-v. V, 13; VI, 12, 56; VII, 88,
are included.}

   (27) The crow craft{4}.  
   (28) Foretelling the number of years that a man has yet to live.  
   (29) Giving charms to ward off arrows{5}.  
   (30) The animal wheel{6}.  

   Gotama the recluse holds aloof from such low arts."

Ath.-v. VI, 90, 93, 100).

2\. These are explained to mean simply curing the bites of these
creatures.

3\. Understanding their language.

4\. Divining by the appearance and the cawings of crows,

6\. Miga-kakkam. Understanding the language of all creatures.

7\. The whole of this 'low art' as applied to gems has been collected in
a series of manuals now edited by L. Finot in his 'Lapidaires Indiens,'
Paris, 1896.

8\. The art in these four cases is to determine whether the marks on
them show they will bring good (or bad) luck to the houses in which they
dwell.

9\. The art in these five cases is to say whether it is unclean or not
to eat them.

10\. This comes in here very oddly. But the old commentator had the same
reading, and takes the word in its ordinary senses, not even as amulet.}

   Thus will there be victory on this side, defeat on that--

   Gotama the recluse holds aloof from such low arts."

   24. 'Or he might say: "Whereas some recluses and Brahmans, while
living on food provided by the faithful, earn their living by wrong
means of livelihood, by such low arts as foretelling--

   (1) There will be an eclipse of the moon.  
   (2) There will be an eclipse of the sun.  
   (3) There will be an eclipse of a star (Nakshatra){2}.  
   (4) There will be aberration of the sun or the moon.  
   (5) The sun or the moon will return to its usual path.  
   (6) There will be aberrations of the stars.  
   (7) The stars will return to their usual course{3}.  

{1. Throughout these paragraphs the plural is used. This cannot be
honorific, as the few great kings of that time are always spoken of in
the singular. Yet all the previous translators, except Burnouf,
translate by the singular--'the king will march out,' &c. It is evident
that we have to understand 'chiefs,' and not the 'king': and that not
absolute monarchies, but republican institutions of a more or less
aristocratic type, were in the mind of the composer of the paragraph.

2\. Nakkhatta, translated by Gogerly and Neumann a 'planet.' Buddhaghosa
explains it by 'Mars and so on.' This may apply to planets, but also to
stars in general, and I know no other passage where the meaning of the
word is confined to planets. Burnouf has 'constellation,' but what can
the eclipse of a constellation mean?

3\. Patha-gamana and uppatha-gamana. Prof. Kielhorn says (in a note he
has been kind enough to send me on this section): 'What the author means
by these words I do not know. But uppatha-gamana would be literally
"aberration, the going away from one's proper path"; and patha-gamana
therefore should be "following one's proper course." I am sure the two
words could not mean conjunction and opposition; nor, I think, ascension
and declension. It is curious that Buddhaghosa has not explained them.'}

{1. Ukkâ-pâto. See *G*ât. I, 374; Mil. 178.

2\. Disâ-dâho. 'Thunder and lightning,' according to Neumann; 'fiery
corruscations in the atmosphere,' according to Gogerly, whom Burnouf
follows. But Buddhaghosa's words are only explicable of a jungle fire.
Compare *G*ât. I, 212, 213, 374.

3\. Burnouf takes these four words to refer to four occurrences. Gogerly
and Neumann take them as only two. Buddhaghosa seems to imply four.

4\. Muddâ. There has been great diversity in the various guesses made at
the meaning in this connection of muddâ, which usually means 'seal' or
'seal-ring.' Gogerly has 'conveyancing,' and so also Childers; Burnouf
takes this word and the next as one compound in the sense of foretelling
the future 'by calculating diagrams'; and Neumann has
'Verwaltungsdienste,' administrative services. Buddhaghosa is very curt.
He says only hattha-mudda ganana. Hattha-muddâ is found elsewhere only
at *G*ât. III, 528, where hattha-mudda*m* karoti means 'to beckon,' and
at Vin. V, 163, where it is said of the polite member of the Order that
he makes no sign with his hand, nor beckons. (On hattha-vikâra compare
Mil. I, 207, 547 = Vin. I, 157 = Vin. II, 2I6.) Both these passages are
much later than our text, and the sense of beckoning is here impossible.
But muddâ is mentioned as a craft at Vin. IV, 7 (where it is called
honourable), at M. I, 85, and several times in the Milinda (pp. 3, 59,
78, 178 of the Pâli text), and muddiko as the person who practises that
craft at D. I, 51 and Vin. IV, 8. The Sinhalese comment on this (quoted
in my translation of the Milinda, I, 91) shows that the art there was
simply arithmetic, using the joints or knuckles or the fingers as an aid
to memory. And this is no doubt the meaning in our paragraph.}

<span id="p. 22">{p. 22}</span>

   Counting without using the fingers{1}.

   Summing up large totals{2}.

   Composing ballads, poetizing{3}.

   Casuistry, sophistry{4}--

   Gotama the recluse holds aloof from such low arts."

   26. Or he might say: "Whereas some recluses and Brahmans, while
living on food provided by the faithful, earn their living by wrong
means of livelihood, by low arts, such as--

{1. Gananâ. Buddhaghosa's comment on this is a*kkh*iddakâ-ga*n*anâ, in
contradistinction to the last. It is evidently calculation not broken up
by using the fingers, mental arithmetic pure and simple. The accountant
who uses this method is called ga*n*ako (D. I, 51; Vin. IV, 8).
Buddhaghosa's comment on the latter passage is given by Minayeff at Pat.
84, but with a wrong reading, akkhi*mt*aka.

2\. Sa*m*khâ*n*am, literally 'counting up.' He who has the faculty of
doing this can, on looking at a tree, say how many leaves it has, says
Buddhaghosa. But the first words of his comment are doubtful. He may
perhaps mean calculating masses by means of the rosary. Burnouf skips
this word, and Neumann has simply 'counting.'

3\. Kâveyya*m*. The word recurs, in a bad sense, at A. I, 72 = III, 107,
and also at S. I, 110 in the phrase kâveyya-matto, 'drunk with prophecy,
inspired.' Buddhaghosa enumerates, in the words of A. II, 230, four
kinds of poetry, and explains them in nearly the same words as found in
the Manoratha Pûranî on that passage. None of the four refer to
sacrificial hymns. Impromptu rhyming, ballad singing, and the
composition of poems are meant.

4\. Lokâyata*m*. Usually rendered 'materialism.' But it is quite clear
that this meaning is impossible in this connection. See Milinda. 174.}

{1. Compare the Sinhalese bîna marriage in which the bridegroom is
brought into the house of the bride's family.

2\. Compare the Sinhalese dîga marriage in which the bride is sent out
to live in the bridegroom's family. We have no words now in English to
express this difference between marrying and giving in marriage.

3\. Sa*m*vadana*m*. Childers calls this a magic art, following Burnouf
who calls it sorcery. Buddhaghosa explains it as astrology. The fact is
all these expressions are technical terms for acts of astrology or
sorcery, they none of them occur elsewhere either in Pâli or Sanskrit,
and the tradition preserved by Buddhaghosa may be at fault in those
cases in which the use of the word had not survived to later times. The
general sense may be sufficiently clear, but for absolute certainty of
interpretation we must wait till examples are found in Indian books of
the actual use of the words, not in mere lists, hut in a connection
which shows the meaning. Ath.-v. III, 30 is a charm to secure concord in
a family, compare VII, 52; and there are several charms in the
Atharva-veda for success in gambling.

4\. Subhaga-karana*m*. Many such charms are preserved in the
Atharva-veda (for instance, X, 3; 5; XVI, 4; 9).

5\. It would be useless to seek in the Atharva-veda, which (with the one
exception mentioned in the notes to the next section) gives only the
charms which are supposed to bring benefits, for instances of these
malevolent practices. But we have here direct evidence that black magic,
as was indeed inevitable, was as fully trusted in the sixth century B.C.
in the valley of the Ganges as white. We need not be surprised that the
malevolent charms are not recorded.}

   Gotama the recluse holds aloof from such low arts."

{1. Âdâsa-pañ*h*o. Buddhaghosa says they made a god appear in the mirror
and answer questions put. It is a later conception to discard the god,
and make the mirror itself give pictures of the hidden events. The
mirror is of metal (Par. Dîp. 235).

2\. Kumârî-pañ*h*o. Through a girl of good family and repute.

3\. Deva-pañ*h*o. Also obtained through a girl, but this time a
deva-dâsî or temple prostitute. It is instructive to find, even under
the patriarchal regime of the sixth century B. C., that men thought they
could best have communications from the gods through the medium of a
woman.

4\. Âdi*kk*upa*tth*ânam. Such sun-worship is ridiculed in the *G*âtaka
of the same name, No. 173.

5\. Buddhaghosa explains the Great One as Mahâ Brahmâ. This seems to me
very doubtful. It is at least odd to find Brahmâ introduced in this
connection. We may grant that the Buddhists might have put sun-worship
into a list of sorceries, but there was no ceremonial cult of Brahma and
little or none of Brahmâ. And however much the new gospel might hold the
spetulations of the dominant theosophy in contempt, that would scarcely
explain their being ranked as privates in this regiment. Burnouf avoids
this by rendering the phrase generally 'serving the great,' and Neumann
has 'practising sorcery.' Neither of these guesses seems happy. Mahat in
composition is elsewhere always mahâ in Pâli, and we possibly have here
a sandhi for mahatî-upa*tth*âna*m*, in the sense of worship of the Great
Mother, the Earth, with covert allusion to mahî. This would give
excellent sense, as the worship of the Mother Earth was closely
associated in the popular mind with witchcraft. A god or goddess is
certainly meant, and one so associated would be best in place here. It
is perhaps worthy of note that in the oldest portion of the Taittirîya
Upanishad, Sun, Moon, Earth, and *S*rî occur together in a set of mystic
groups, and Sun, Moon, Brahma, and food are all identified by a
word-play with Mahas (Sîk*s*â-vallî 4-7).

desire to fail by a spell. Several such are preserved in the Atharva

set forth; and it is of them that they, who would rightly praise the

{1. The Buddhist view of Nos. 11-25 must not be mistaken. It is
sufficiently clear from the numerous examples in the Vinaya (see
especially 'Vinaya Texts,' II, pp. 41-144), and from the high praise
accorded to *G*îvaka and other physicians, that the objection was to
recluses and Brahmans practising medicine as a means of livelihood. They
might do so gratis for themselves or for their coreligionists, and
laymen might do so for gain.

The use of pa*t*imokkha in No. 25 is curious. It is when, for instance,
a purgative is first given and then a tonic to counteract the other, to
set free from its effect. Compare *G*ât. V, 25.

2\. The corresponding Sanskrit terms occur at Divyâvadâna, p. 492. No
doubt the reading there ought to be nipu*n*o.

3\. These phrases recur S. Ill, 45. On anuddi*tth*i see also Gogerly in

a delusion. The Greek {Greek *dóksa*} has had a similar history, and

of ardour, of exertion, of application, of earnestness, of careful
thought, reaches up to such rapture of heart that, rapt in heart, he

hundreds or thousands or laks of births--to the effect that "There I had

in such and such a lineage and caste, living on such and such food,

gentiles of Roman Law) in the later law-books see West and Bühler,
'Hindu Law of Inheritance,' p. 171.

3\. Va*nn*a, literally 'colour.' Gogerly renders it 'appearance,' and
Neumann 'Beruf.' I have chosen caste (though it is not caste in its
strictest sense) because it no doubt refers to the *k*attâro va*nn*â
mentioned so often in the Suttas. It is true that these--Khattiyas,
Brahmans, Vessas, and Suddas--were not castes, but four divisions of the
people, each consisting of many subdivisions (by customs as to connubium
and commensality) which afterwards hardened into castes. See J. R. A.
S., 1897, pp. 180-190.}

in times gone by. <span id="text p. 14">\[14\]</span> And he says to
himself: "Eternal is the soul; and the world, giving birth to nothing
new, is stedfast as a mountain peak, as a pillar firmly fixed; and
though these living creatures transmigrate and pass away, fall from one
state of existence and spring up in another, yet they are for ever and
ever. And why must that be so? Because I, by means of ardour of exertion
of application of earnestness of careful thought, can reach up to such
rapture of heart that, rapt in heart, I can call to mind, and in full
detail both of condition and of custom, my various dwelling-places in
times gone by--by that is it that I know this--that the soul is eternal;
and that the world, giving birth to nothing new, is stedfast as a
mountain peak, as a pillar firmly fixed; and that though these living
creatures transmigrate and pass away, fall from one state of existence
and spring up in another, yet they are for ever and ever."

   'This, brethren, is the first state of things on account of which,
starting from which, some recluses and Brahmans are Eternalists, and
maintain that both the soul and the world are eternal.

turn). It is the period of the gradual disintegration and conformation
of a world. Needless to add that the length of this period cannot be
expressed in figures.

Neither the idea nor the word occurs in books known to be before the
Buddha. But both are Indian rather than Buddhist. Sa*m*varta is found in
the Mahâ Bhârata and the Râmâya*n*a; and the later Sâ<u>n</u>khya notion
of pralaya is closely allied.}

<span id="p. 29">{p. 29}</span>

is addicted to logic and reasoning. He gives utterance to the following
conclusion of his own, beaten out by his argumentations and based on his
sophistry{1}; "Eternal is the soul; and the world, giving birth to
nothing new, is stedfast as a mountain peak, as a pillar firmly fixed;
and these living creatures, though they transmigrate and pass away, fall
from one state of existence and spring up in another, yet they are for
ever and ever."

   'This, brethren, is the fourth state of things on the ground of
which, starting from which, some recluses and Brahmans are Eternalists,

Eternalists, and in four ways maintain that both the soul and the world

maintain this, they do so in these four ways, or in one or other of the
same, and outside these there is no way in which this opinion is arrived
at.

forth; and it is concerning these that they who would rightly praise the

### CHAPTER II.

   1. 'There are, brethren, some recluses and Brahmans who are
Eternalists with regard to some things, and in regard to others
Non-Eternalists; who on four grounds maintain that the soul and the
world are partly eternal and partly not.

   'And what is it that these venerable ones depend upon, what is it
that they start from, in arriving at this conclusion?

   2. 'Now there comes a time, brethren, when, sooner or later, after
the lapse of a long long period, this world-system passes away. And when
this happens beings have mostly been reborn in the World of Radiance,
and there they dwell made of mind, feeding on joy, radiating light from
themselves, traversing the air, continuing in glory; and thus they
remain for a long long period of time.

   3. 'Now there comes also a time, brethren, when,

{1. Gogerly (pp. 77, 78 in Grimblot) has made a sad mess of this
paragraph, misunderstanding the grammatical construction of the first
clause, and misinterpreting parâmasati in the second, and nissara*n*a*m*
in the third.

2\. Not of course the four speculations, but the higher knowledge which
has led him to reject them.}

<span id="p. 31">{p. 31}</span>

sooner or later, this world-system begins to re-evolve. When this
happens the Palace of Brahmâ appears, but it is empty. And some being or
other, either because his span of years has passed or his merit is
exhausted, falls from that World of Radiance, and comes to life in the
Palace of Brahmâ. And there also he lives made of mind, feeding on joy,
radiating light from himself, traversing the air, continuing in glory;
and thus does he remain for a long long period of time.

   4. 'Now there arises in him, from his dwelling there so long alone, a
dissatisfaction and a longing: "O! would that other beings might come to
join me in this place!" And just then, either because their span of
years had passed or their merit was exhausted, other beings fall from
the World of Radiance, and appear in the Palace of Brahmâ as companions
to him, and in all respects like him. <span
id="text p. 18">\[18\]</span>

   5. 'On this, brethren, the one who was first reborn thinks thus to
himself: "I am Brahmâ, the Great Brahmâ, the Supreme One, the Mighty,
the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the
Chief of all, appointing to each his place, the Ancient of days, the
Father of all that are and are to be{1}. These other beings are of my
creation. And why is that so? A while ago I thought, 'Would that they
might come!' And on my mental aspiration, behold the beings came."

   'And those beings themselves, too, think thus: "This must be Brahmâ,
the Great Brahmâ, the Supreme, the Mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler,
the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the Chief of all, appointing to
each his place, the Ancient of days, the Father of all that are

{1. This string of epithets recurs at M. I, 327 in the course of the
story of the Brahmâ, named Baka, who is represented as coming to the
very conclusion set out in our section. The story was a favourite one,
and three recensions of it have been preserved (M. I, 326-331; S. I,
142-144. and *G*ât. No. 405). Mr. Crow evidently considered himself the
Mahâ Brahmâ of the period.

The omission in the Dialogue of all reference to the Kesava Birth Story
may be a sign of greater age or it may be due simply to the fact that it
is not required for the argument there.}

<span id="p. 32">{p. 32}</span>

and are to be, And we must have been created by him. And why? Because,
as we see, it was he who was here first, and we came after that."

   6. 'On this, brethren, the one who first came into existence there is
of longer life, and more glorious, and more powerful than those who
appeared after him. And it might well be, brethren, that some being on
his falling from that state, should come hither. And having come hither
he might go forth from the household life into the homeless state, And
having thus become a recluse he, by reason of ardour of exertion of
application of earnestness of careful thought, reaches up to such
rapture of heart that, rapt in heart, he calls to mind his last
dwelling-place, but not the previous ones. He says to himself: "That
illustrious Brahmâ, the Great Brahmâ, the Supreme One, the Mighty, the
All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the
Chief of all, appointing to each his place, the Ancient of days, the
Father of all that are and are to be, he by whom we were created, he is
stedfast immutable eternal, of a nature that knows no change, and he
will remain so for ever and ever. But we who were created by him have
come hither as being impermanent mutable limited in duration of life.

   <span id="text p. 19">\[19\]</span> 'This, brethren, is the first
state of things on account of which, starting out from which, some
recluses and Brahmans, being Eternalists as to some things, and
Non-eternalists as to others, maintain that the soul and the world are
partly eternal and partly not.

   7. 'And what is the second?

   'There are, brethren, certain gods called the "Debauched by
Pleasure{1}," For ages they pass their time in the pursuit of the
laughter and sport of sensual lusts. In consequence thereof their
self-possession is corrupted, and through the loss of their self-control
they fall from that state:{2}.

{1. Khi*dd*â-padosikâ. They are not mentioned elsewhere except in the
list of gods in the Mahâ Samaya (p. 287).

2\. Buddhaghosa on this has a curious note. The gods, though of great
glory, are delicate in body. A man, having gone without food for seven
days even, may restore his strength by the use of clear broth and so on.
But the gods can't play tricks with themselves; and it they lose their
heads and forget their meal-times, they die--pass away from that state.
The poor gods! Whether this be really implied in the text or not, it is
at least in harmony with the irony of the Buddha's talk.}

<span id="p. 33">{p. 33}</span>

   8. 'Now it might well be, brethren, that some being, on his falling
from that state, should come hither. And having come hither he should,
as in the last case, become a recluse, and acquire the power of
recollecting his last birth, but only his last one.

   9. 'And he would say to himself: "Those gods who are not debauched by
pleasure are stedfast, immutable, eternal, of a nature that knows no
change, and they will remain so for ever and ever. <span
id="text p. 20">\[20\]</span> But we--who fell from that state, having
lost our self-control through being debauched by pleasure--we have come
hither as being impermanent, mutable, limited in duration of life."

They burn continually with envy{2} one against another, and being thus
irritated, their hearts become ill-disposed towards each other, and
being thus debauched, their bodies become feeble, and their minds
imbecile. And those gods fall from that state.

the regents of the four quarters.

quarrelsome nature of these gods. In the sense of 'consider' (from
*gh*âyati, to think) the word has only been found at S. N., p. 143.

in mind do not continually burn with envy against each other, so their
hearts do not become evil disposed one towards another, nor their bodies
feeble and their minds imbecile. Therefore they fall not from that
state; they are stedfast, immutable, eternal, of a nature that knows no
change, and they will remain so for ever and ever. <span

constantly excited by envy against one another. And being thus envious
and corrupt our bodies became feeble, and our minds imbecile, and we
fell from that state, and have come hither as being impermanent,
mutable, limited in duration of life."

is impermanent, unstable, not eternal, subject to change. But this which
is called heart, or mind, or consciousness is a self which is permanent,
stedfast, eternal, and knows no change, and it will remain for ever and

given rise to the succeeding one than it passes away. Not perceiving
that, and depending on the analogy of birds, who fly away from one tree
only to alight on another, they conclude that the mind, when this

### CHAPTER III.

   1. 'There are, brethren, recluses and Brahmans who hold the doctrine
of an unconscious existence after death, and who maintain in eight ways
that the soul after death is unconscious. And how do they do so?

   2. 'They say of the soul: "The soul after death, not subject to
decay, and unconscious,

   (1) has form,  
   (2) is formless,  
   (3) has, and has not, form,  
   (4) neither has, nor has not, form  
   (5) is finite,  
   (6) is infinite,  
   (7) is both,  
   (8) is neither."  

   3. 'These, brethren, are those recluses and Brahmans who hold the
doctrine of an unconscious existence after death, and who maintain in
eight ways that the soul after death is unconscious. And those who do
so, all of them, do so in one or other of those eight ways. There is
none beside.

   4. 'Now of these, brethren, the Tathâgata knows that these
speculations thus arrived at, thus insisted on, will have such and such
a result, such and such an effect on the future condition of those who
trust in them. That does he know, and he knows also other things far
beyond (far better than those speculations); and having that knowledge
he is not puffed up, and thus untarnished he has, in his own heart,
realised the

way of escape from them, has understood, as they really are, the rising
up and passing away of sensations. their sweet taste, their danger, how
they cannot be relied on, and not grasping after any (of those things
men are eager for) he, the Tathâgata, is quite set free.

   'These, brethren, are those other things, profound, difficult to
realise, hard to understand, tranquillising, sweet, not to be grasped by
mere logic, subtle, comprehensible only by the wise, which the
Tathâgata, having himself realised and seen face to face hath set forth;
and it is concerning these that they who would rightly praise the
Tathâgata in accordance with the truth should speak.

   {1}9. <span id="text p. 34">\[34\]</span> 'There are, brethren,
recluses and Brahmans who are Annihilationists, who in seven ways
maintain the cutting off, the destruction, the annihilation of a living
being{2}. And on account of what, starting out from what, do they do so?

   10. 'In the first place, brethren, some recluse or Brahman puts forth
the following opinion, the following view: "Since, Sir, this soul has
form, is built up of the four elements, and is the offspring of father
and mother, it is cut off, destroyed, on the dissolution of the body;
and does not continue after death; and then, Sir, the soul is completely
annihilated." Thus is it that some maintain the cutting off, the
destruction, the annihilation of a living being.

   11. 'To him another says: "There is, Sir, such a soul as you
describe. That I do not deny. But the whole soul, Sir, is not then
completely annihilated. For there is a further soul--divine, having
form, belonging to the sensuous plane, feeding on solid food. That you
neither know of nor perceive. But I know

<span id="p. 47">{p. 47}</span>

and have experienced it. And since this soul, on the dissolution of the
body, is cut off and destroyed, does not continue after death, then is
it, Sir, that the soul is completely annihilated." Thus is it that some
maintain the cutting off, the destruction, the annihilation of a living
being.

   12. 'To him another says: "There is, Sir, such a soul as you
describe. That I do not deny. But the whole soul, Sir, is not then
completely annihilated. For there is a further soul-divine, having form,
made of mind, with all its major and minor parts complete, not deficient
in any organ. This you neither know of nor perceive. But I know and have
experienced it. And since this soul, on the dissolution of the body, is
cut off and destroyed, does not continue after death, then is it, Sir,
that the soul is completely annihilated." Thus is it that some maintain
the cutting off, the destruction, the annihilation of a living being.

   13. 'To him another says: "There is, Sir, such a soul as you
describe. That I do not deny. But the whole soul, Sir, is not then
completely annihilated. For there is a further soul, which by passing
beyond ideas of form, by the dying out of ideas of resistance, by paying
no heed to ideas of difference, conscious that space is infinite,
reaches up to the plane of the infinity of space{1}. This you neither
know of nor perceive. <span id="text p. 35">\[35\]</span> But I know and
have experienced it. And since this soul, on the dissolution of the
body, is cut off and destroyed, does not continue after death, then is
it, Sir, that the soul is completely annihilated." Thus is it that some
maintain the cutting off, the destruction, the annihilation of a living
being.

   14. 'To him another says: "There is, Sir, such a soul as you
describe. That I do not deny. But the whole soul, Sir, is not then
completely annihilated.

<span class="small">{1. Compare the 4th Vimokha. See Rh. D. 'Buddhist
Suttas,' pp. 52, 213. The idea of resistance, pa*t*igha, is here not
ethical, but refers to the senses. Having no sense of reaction to touch,
of opposition to muscular effort. It appears from M. I, 164 that this
was pretty much the view put forth by Gotama's first teacher Â*l*âra
Kâlâma.}</span>

<span id="p. 48">{p. 48}</span>

For there is a further soul, which having passed beyond the plane of the
infinity of space, knowing that consciousness is infinite, reaches up to
the plane of the infinity of consciousness{1}. This you neither know of
nor perceive. But I know and have experienced it. And since this soul,
on the dissolution of the body, is cut off and destroyed, does not
continue after death, then is it, Sir, that the soul is completely
annihilated." Thus is it that some maintain the cutting off, the
destruction, the annihilation of a living being.

   15. 'To him another says: "There is, Sir, such a soul as you
describe. That I do not deny. But the whole soul, Sir, is not then
completely annihilated. For there is a further soul, which by passing
quite beyond the plane of the infinity of consciousness, knowing that
there is nothing, reaches up to the plane of no obstruction{2}. This you
neither know of nor perceive. But I know and have experienced it. And
since this soul, on the dissolution of the body, is cut off and
destroyed, does not continue after death, then is it, Sir, that the soul
is completely annihilated." Thus is it that some maintain the cutting
off, the destruction, the annihilation of a living being.

   16. 'To him another says: "There is, Sir, such a soul as you
describe. That I do not deny. But the whole soul, Sir, is not then
completely annihilated. For there is a further soul, which by passing
quite beyond the plane of no obstruction, realises 'This is good, this
is excellent,' and reaches up to the plane of neither ideas nor the
absence of ideas{3}. This you

{1. Compare the 5th Vimokha. This seems from M. I, 165 to have been much
the same as the view held by Râma, whose son and pupil, Uddaka, was
Gotama's second teacher.

2\. Compare the 6th Vimokha.

3\. Though it is not explicitly so stated, this last of these seven
theorisers is no doubt to be considered as believing in all the sorts of
soul held by the others, so that he believes in seven. One may compare
the five souls each more subtle than the last, made respectively of
anna, prâ*n*a, manas, vi*gñ*â*n*a, and ânanda (food, breath, mind,
consciousness, and joy), described in the Taittirîya Upanishad II, 1-5.
The Buddhist modification of these theories omits the souls, and treats
instead of various states of mind (produced by stages of meditation),
the attainment of which, during this life, leads to rebirth in
corresponding worlds, or planes of existence, named after those stages
of meditations. But the oldest Pi*t*aka texts say very little about it,
and the history of Buddhist speculation on the matter has yet to be
formulated.

Centuries afterwards we find a somewhat analogous conception in the
gradually ascending series of seven, each more subtle than the last
(Sthûla-*s*arira, li<u>n</u>ga-*s*arîra, indriya, manas,
aha<u>n</u>kara, buddhi, and âtman), set out in the Sâ<u>n</u>khya
texts, and the later Vedânta has a similar series. There is sufficient
truth in the idea or the series of seven set out in our text to explain
the persistence of the general idea in all the Indian systems, but the
details and the application are strikingly different.

The text shows that the four Arûpa Vimokhas of the Buddhist theory were
regarded by the early Buddhists as derived from closely allied
speculations, older than Buddhism, and expressed in almost identical
phraseology.}

<span id="p. 49">{p. 49}</span>

neither know of, nor perceive. But I know and have experienced it. And
since this soul, on the dissolution of the body, is cut off, destroyed,
does not continue after death, then is it, Sir, that the soul is
completely annihilated." Thus is it that some maintain the cutting off,
the destruction, the annihilation of a living being.

   17. 'These, brethren, are the recluses and Brahmans who are
Annihilationists and in seven ways maintain the cutting off, the
destruction, the annihilation of a living being. <span

so in one or other of these seven ways. There is none beside.

   19. 'There are, brethren, recluses and Brahmans who hold the doctrine
of happiness in this life, who in five ways maintain the complete
salvation, in this visible world, of a living being. And relying on
what, starting out from what, do they do so?

   20. 'Hereon, brethren, some recluse or Brahman may have the following
opinion, the following view: "Whensoever the soul, in full enjoyment and
possession

<span id="p. 50">{p. 50}</span>

of the five pleasures of sense, indulges all its functions, then, Sir,
the soul has attained, in this visible world, to the highest
Nirvâ*n*a{1}." Thus do some maintain the complete happiness, in the
visible world, of a living being.

   21. 'To him another says: "There is, Sir, such a soul as you
describe. That I do not deny. But the soul does not by that alone attain
to the highest Nirvâ*n*a. And why not? Sensuous delights, Sir, are
transitory, they involve pain, their very nature is to fluctuate. And
grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and loathing arise out of their
inconstancy and change. <span id="text p. 37">\[37\]</span> But
whensoever the soul, putting away sensuous delights and evil
dispositions, enters into and abides in the First *Gh*âna, the state of
joy and ease, born of seclusion, accompanied by reflection, accompanied
by investigation, then, Sir, has the soul attained, in this visible
world, to the highest Nirvâ*n*a." Thus do some maintain the complete
happiness, in the visible world, of a living being.

   22. 'To him another says: "There is, Sir, such a soul as you
describe. That I do not deny. But the soul does not by that alone attain
to the highest Nirvâ*n*a. And why not? Because inasmuch as that state
involves reasoning and investigation it is stamped as being gross. But
whensoever, Sir, the soul, suppressing both reasoning and investigation,
enters into and abides in the Second *Gh*âna, the state of joy and ease,
born of serenity, without reflection or investigation, a state of
elevation of mind, internal calm of heart, then, Sir, has the soul
attained, in this visible world, to the highest Nirvâ*n*a." Thus do some
maintain the complete happiness, in the visible world, of a living
being.

<span class="small">{1. Buddhaghosa here (Sum. I, 12') explains
Nirvâ*n*a as the suppression of pain; pain, dukha, being bodily, as
opposed to domanassa, mental. 'In this visible world' means in whatever
world the particular soul happens to be at the time. On parikâreti
compare V. II, 290 râ*g*â uyyâne pari*k*âresi, 'the king indulged
himself, enjoyed himself, in the garden.' 'All its functions' is added

to the highest Nirvâ*n*a. And why not? Because inasmuch as that state
involves the sense of joy, of exhilaration of heart, it is stamped as
being gross. But whensoever, Sir, the soul, by absence of the longing
after joy remains in equanimity, mindful and self-possessed, and
experiences in the body that ease of which the Arahats speak (when they
say) 'the man serene and thoughtful dwells at ease,' and so enters into
and abides in the Third *Gh*âna--then, Sir, has the soul attained, in
this visible world, to the highest Nirvâ*n*a." Thus do some maintain the
complete happiness, in the visible world, of a living being.

previous dying away both of joys and griefs has entered into and abides
in the Fourth *Gh*âna{1}--a state made pure by self-possession and
equanimity, without pain arid without ease--then, Sir, has the soul
attained, in this visible world, to the highest Nirvâ*n*a." Thus do some
