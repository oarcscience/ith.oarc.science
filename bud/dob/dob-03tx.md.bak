## III. AMBA*TTH*A SUTTA.

### \[A YOUNG BRAHMAN'S RUDENESS AND AN OLD ONE'S FAITH.\]

   I. 1. Thus have I heard. The Blessed One, when once on a tour through
the Kosala country with a great company of the brethren, with about five
hundred brethren, arrived at a Brahman village in Kosala named
I*kkh*ânankala; and while there he stayed in the I*kkh*ânankala Wood.

   Now at that time the Brahman Pokkharasâdi was dwelling at Ukka*tth*a,
a spot teeming with life, with much grassland and woodland and corn, on
a royal domain, granted him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift,
with power over it as if he were the king{1}.

   2. Now the Brahman Pokkharasâdi{2} heard the news:

{1. So Buddhaghosa; but he gives no further details as to the terms; of
the grant, or of the tenancy. The whole string of adjectives recurs
below, pp. [111](dob-04tx.htm#text%20p.%20111.md),
[114](dob-04tx.htm#text%20p.%20114.md),
[127](dob-05tx.htm#text%20p.%20127), [131](dob-05tx.htm#text%20p.%20134.md)
{see note 1 for the last ref.} of the text, and râ*g*a-bhogga*m* at Vin.
III, 222. Compare Divyâvadâna, p. 620.

The land revenue, payable of course in kind, would be a tithe. If the
king had full proprietary (zemindary) rights as well, which is the
probable meaning of râ*g*a-bhogga*m*, his share would be, either with or
without the land tax, one half. The grant would be of his own rights
only. The rights of the peasants to the other half, and to the use of
the common and waste and woods, would remain to them. If Buddhaghosa's
interpretation of brahmadeyya*m* is correct, then the grantee would also
be the king's representative for all purposes judicial and executive.
Elsewhere the word has only been found as applied to marriage; and the
first part of the compound (brahma) has always been interpreted by
Brahmans as referring to themselves. But brahma as the first part of a
compound never has that meaning in Pâli; and the word in our passage
means literally 'a full gift.'

2\. His full name was Pokkharasâdi Opama*ññ*o Subhagavaniko (M. II,
200); where the second is the gotta (*gens*) name and the third a local
name. See the [Introduction to the Mahâli Sutta](dob-06in.md).}

<span id="p. 109">{p. 109}</span>

'They say that the Sama*n*a Gotama, of the Sâkya clan, who went out from
a Sâkya family to adopt the religious life, has now arrived, with a
great company of the brethren of his Order, at I*kkh*ânankala, and is
staying there in the I*kkh*ânankala Wood. Now regarding that venerable
Gotama, such is the high reputation that has been noised abroad:--That
Blessed One is an Arahat, a fully awakened one, abounding in wisdom and
goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to
mortals willing to be led, a teacher for gods and men, a Blessed One, a
Buddha. He, by himself, thoroughly knows and sees, as it were, face to
face this universe,--including the worlds above of the gods, the
Brahmas, and the Mâras, and the world below with its recluses and
Brahmans, its princes and peoples,--and having known it, he makes his
knowledge known to others. The truth, lovely in its origin, lovely in
its progress, lovely in its consummation, doth he proclaim, both in the
spirit and in the letter, the higher life doth he make known, in all its
fullness and in all its purity.

   <span id="text p. 88">\[88\]</span> 'And good is it to pay visits to
Arahats like that.'

   3. Now at that time a young Brahman, an Amba*tth*a{1}, was a pupil
under Pokkharasâdi the Brahman. And he was a repeater (of the sacred
words) knowing the mystic verses by heart, one who had mastered the
Three Vedas, with the indices, the ritual, the phonology, and the
exegesis (as a fourth){2}, and the legends

{1. According to *G*ât. IV, 363 (compare *G*ât. IV, 366) there were also
Amba*tth*as who were not Brahmans by birth, but farmers.

2\. The fourth is not expressly mentioned. Buddhaghosa (p. 247) says we
have to supply the fourth Veda, the Atharva. But the older Pâli texts do
not acknowledge the Atharva as a Veda. It only occurs, as the
Athabba*n*a Veda, in the A*tth*akathâs and *T*îkâs. And it is quite
unnecessary to suppose a silent reference to it here. The fourth place
is quite sufficiently filled as suggested in the translation. The
Âthabba*n*a, given (in S. N, 927) as the name of a mystic art (together
with astrology, the interpretation of dreams and of lucky signs, and so
forth), is probably not the Veda, but witchcraft or sorcery. The
Pi*t*akas always take three Vedas, and three only, for granted. And the
whole point of the Tevi*gg*a Sutta (translated in full in my 'Buddhist
Suttas') is this three-, not four-, fold division. Four Vedas are
referred to in the Milinda, at p. 3, and the Atharva-veda, at p. 117.}

<span id="p. 110">{p. 110}</span>

as a fifth. learned in the idioms and the grammar, versed in Lokâyata
sophistry, and in the theory of the signs on the body of a great
man{1},--so recognised an authority in the system of the threefold Vedic
knowledge as expounded by his master, that he could say of him: 'What I
know that you know, and what you know that I know.'

   4. And Pokkarasâdi told Amba*tth*a the news, and said: 'Come now,
dear Amba*tth*a, go to the Sama*n*a Gotama, and find out whether the
reputation so noised abroad regarding him is in accord with the facts or
not, whether the Sama*n*a Gotama is such as they say or not.'

   5. 'But how, Sir, shall I know whether that is so or not?'

   'There have been handed down, Amba*tth*a, in our mystic verses
thirty-two bodily signs of a great man,--signs which, if a man has, he
will become one of two things, and no other{2}. If he dwells at home he
will become a sovran of the world, a righteous king, bearing rule even
to the shores of the four great oceans, a conqueror, the protector of
his people, possessor of the seven royal treasures. <span
id="text p. 89">\[89\]</span> And these are the seven treasures that he
has--the Wheel, the Elephant, the Horse, the Gem, the Woman, the
Treasurer, and the

{1. This is the standing description in the Suttas of a learned Brahman.
See below, pp. [114](dob-04tx.htm#text%20p.%20114.md),
[120](dob-04tx.htm#text%20p.%20120) (of the text.md); A. I, 163; Mil. 10;
Divyâvadâna 620, &c. One or two of the details are not quite certain, as
yet.

2\. The knowledge of these thirty-two marks of a Great Being,
(Mahâ-purusha) is one of the details in the often-recurring paragraph
giving the points of Brahman wisdom, which we have just had at § 3. No
such list has been found, so far as I know, in those portions of the
pre-Buddhistic priestly literature that have survived. And the inference
from both our passages is that the knowledge is scattered through the
Brahman texts. Many of the details of the Buddhist list (see the note
below on [p. 106](#text%20p.%20106) of the text.md) are very obscure; and a
collection of the older Brahman passages would probably throw light upon
them, and upon a curious chapter in mythological superstition. Who will
write us a monograph (historical of course) on the Mahâ-purusha theory
as held in early times among the Aryans in India?}

<span id="p. 111">{p. 111}</span>

Adviser as a seventh{1}. And he has more than a thousand sons, heroes,
mighty in frame, beating down the armies of the foe. And he dwells in
complete ascendancy over the wide earth from sea to sea, ruling it in
righteousness without the need of baton or of sword. But if he go forth
from the household life into the houseless state, then he will become a
Buddha who removes the veil from the eyes of the world. Now I,
Amba*tth*a, am a giver of the mystic verses; you have received them from
me.'

   6. 'Very good, Sir,' said Amba*tth*a in reply; and rising from his
seat and paying reverence to Pokkharasâdi, he mounted a chariot drawn by
mares, and proceeded, with a retinue of young Brahmans, to the
I*kkh*ânankala Wood. And when he had gone on in the chariot as far as
the road was practicable for vehicles, he got down, and went on, into
the park, on foot.

   7. Now at that time a number of the brethren were walking up and down
in the open air. And Amba*tth*a went up to them, and said: 'Where may
the venerable Gotama be lodging now? We have come hither to call upon
him.'

   8. Then the brethren thought: 'This young Brahman Amba*tth*a is of
distinguished family. and a pupil of the distinguished Brahman
Pokkharasâdi. The Blessed One will not find it difficult to hold
conversation with such.' And they said to Amba*tth*a: 'There,
Amba*tth*a, is his lodging{2}, where the door is shut, go quietly up and
enter the porch gently, and give a cough, and knock on the cross-bar.
The Blessed One will open the door for you.'

   9. Then Amba*tth*a did so. And the Blessed One opened the door, and
Amba*tth*a entered in. And the other young Brahmans also went in; and
they exchanged with the Blessed One the greetings and

{1. For the details of these seven see further my 'Buddhist Suttas,' pp.
251-259.

2\. Vihâra; often rendered 'monastery,' a meaning the word never has in
the older texts.}

<span id="p. 112">{p. 112}</span>

compliments of politeness and courtesy, and took their seats. But
Amba*tth*a, walking about, said something or other of a civil kind in an
off-hand way, fidgeting about the while, or standing up, to the Blessed
One sitting there.

   <span id="text p. 90">\[90\]</span> 10. And the Blessed One said to
him: 'Is that the way, Amba*tth*a, that you would hold converse with
aged teachers, and teachers of your teachers well stricken in years, as
you now do, moving about the while or standing, with me thus seated?'

   11. 'Certainly not, Gotama. It is proper to speak with a Brahman as
one goes along only when the Brahman himself is walking, and standing to
a Brahman who stands, and seated to a Brahman who has taken his seat, or
reclining to a Brahman who reclines. But with shavelings, sham friars,
menial black fellows, the offscouring of our kinsman's heels{1}--with
them I would talk as I now do to you!'

   'But you must have been wanting something, Amba*tth*a, when you came
here. Turn your thoughts rather to the object you had in view when you
came. This young Brahman Amba*tth*a is ill bred, though he prides
himself on his culture; what can this come from except from want of
training{2}?'

   12. Then Amba*tth*a was displeased and angry with the Blessed One at
being called rude; and at the thought that the Blessed One was vexed
with him, he said, scoffing, jeering, and sneering at the Blessed One:
'Rough is this Sâkya breed of yours, Gotama, and rude; touchy is this
Sâkya breed of yours and

{1. Bandhupâdâpa*kk*â. Neumann, *loc. cit.* p. 521, says 'treading on
one another's heels.' Buddhaghosa refers the expression to the Brahman
theory that the *S*ûdras were born from Brahmâ's heels. And this may
well have been the meaning. For though Gotama and the majority of his
order were well born, still others, of low caste, were admitted to it,
and Amba*tth*a is certainly represented as giving vent to caste
prejudice when he calls the brethren 'black fellows.' Compare M. I, 334;
S. IV, 117, and below, D. I, 103.

2\. And is therefore, after all, not so much his fault as that of his
teacher. That this is the implication is clear from the text, pp. 90, 91
(§§ 10-13) below.}

<span id="p. 113">{p. 113}</span>

violent. <span id="text p. 91">\[91\]</span> Menials, mere menials{1},
they neither venerate, nor value, nor esteem, nor give gifts to, nor pay
honour to Brahmans. That, Gotama, is neither fitting, nor is it seemly!'

   Thus did the young Brahman Amba*tth*a for the first time charge the
Sâkyas with being menials.

   13. 'But in what then, Amba*tth*a, have the Sâkyas given you
offence?'

   'Once, Gotama, I had to go to Kapilavatthu on some business or other
of Pokkharasâdi's, and went into the Sâkyas' Congress Hall{2}. Now at
that time there were a number of Sâkyas, old and young, seated in the
hall on grand seats, making merry and joking together, nudging one
another with their fingers{3}; and for a truth, methinks, it was I
myself that was the subject of their jokes; and not one of them even
offered me a seat. That, Gotama, is neither fitting, nor is it seemly,
that the Sâkyas, menials as they are, mere menials, should neither
venerate, nor value, nor esteem, nor give gifts to, nor pay honour to
Brahmans.'

   Thus did the young Brahman Amba*tth*a for the second time charge the
Sâkyas with being menials.

{1. Ibbhâ. Chalmers J. R. A. S., 1894, p. 343) renders this 'nought but
men of substance,' and he has been followed by Frazer, 'Literature of
India,' p. 118. But Buddhaghosa's interpretation is confirmed both by
the context and by the derivation.

2\. Santhâgâra. Childers is quite wrong about this word. It is the hall
where a clan mote was held, and is used exclusively of places for the
assemblies of the householders in the free republics of Northern Kosala.
It never means a royal rest house, which is râ*g*âgâraka, as we had
above ([p. 1](dob-01tx.htm#p.%202), § 2 of the Pâli text.md). Thus at M. I,
353, 4 and *G*ât. IV, 147 we have this identical hall of the Sâkyas at
Kapilavatthu, and at M. I, 457 a similar one of the Sâkyas at
*K*âtumâya; at M. P. V, 56 (VI, 23 of the translation in my 'Buddhist
Suttas') we have the congress hall of the Mallas of Kusinârâ, and at M.
I, 228 and Vin. I, 233 that of the Li*kkh*avis of Vesâlî-all of them
called Santhâgâra, and all referred to in connection with a public
meeting of the clan.

3\. Anguli-patodakena. The Introductory Story to the 52nd Pâ*k*ittiya
(Vin. IV, 110 = III, 84) tells how a Bhikshu was inadvertently done to
death by being made to laugh immoderately in this way. It must there
mean 'tickling.' Here, and at A. IV, 343, it seems to have the meaning
given above.}

<span id="p. 114">{p. 114}</span>

   14. 'Why a quail, Amba*tth*a, little hen bird though she be, can say
what she likes in her own nest. And there the Sâkyas are at their own
home, in Kapilavatthu. It is not fitting for you to take offence at so
trifling a thing.'

   15. 'There are these four grades{1}, Gotama,--the nobles, the
Brahmans, the tradesfolk, and the work-people. And of these four,
three--the nobles, the tradesfolk, and the work-people--are, verily, but
attendants on the Brahmans. <span id="text p. 92">\[92\]</span> So,
Gotama, that is neither fitting, nor is it seemly, that the Sâkyas,
menials as they are, mere menials, should neither venerate, nor value,
nor esteem, nor give gifts to, nor pay honour to the Brahmans.'

   Thus did the young Brahman Amba*tth*a for the third time charge the
Sâkyas with being menials.

   16. Then the Blessed One thought thus: 'This Amba*tth*a is very set
on humbling the Sâkyas with his charge of servile origin. What if I were
to ask him as to his own lineage.' And he said to him:

   'And what family do you then, Amba*tth*a, belong to?'

   'I am a Ka*n*hâyana.'

   'Yes, but if one were to follow up your ancient name and lineage,
Amba*tth*a, on the father's and the mother's side, it would appear that
the Sâkyas were once your masters, and that you are the offspring of one
of their slave girls. But the Sâkyas trace their line back to Okkâka the
king{2}.

   'Long ago, Amba*tth*a, King Okkâka, wanting to divert the succession
in favour or the son of his favourite queen, banished his elder
children--Okkâmukha, Kara*nd*a, Hatthinika, and Sinipura--from the land.
And being thus banished they took up their dwelling on the slopes of the
Himâlaya, on the borders of a lake where a mighty oak tree grew.

{1. Va*nn*â.

2\. On this famous old king see the legends preserved in the M. B. V,
13; Mahâvastu I, 348;*G*ât. II, 311; Sum. I, 258.}

<span id="p. 115">{p. 115}</span>

And through fear of injuring the purity of their line they intermarried
with their sisters.

   'Now Okkâka the king asked the ministers at his court: "Where, Sirs,
are the children now{1}?"'

   'There is a spot, Sire, on the slopes of the Himâlaya, on the borders
of a lake, where there grows a mighty *oak* (sako). There do they dwell.
And lest they should injure the purity of their line they have married
their *own* (sakâhi) sisters.'

   'Then did Okkâka the king burst forth in admiration <span
id="text p. 93">\[93\]</span>: "Hearts of oak (sakyâ) are those young
fellows! Right well they hold their own (paramasakyâ){2}!"

   'That is the reason, Amba*tth*a, why they are known as Sâkyas. Now
Okkâka had a slave girl called Disâ. She gave birth to a black baby. And
no sooner was it born than the little black thing said, "Wash me,
mother. Bathe me, mother. Set me free, mother, of this dirt. So shall I
be of use to you."

   'Now just as now, Amba*tth*a, people call devils "devils," so then
they called devils "black fellows" (ka*n*he). And they said: "This
fellow spoke as soon as he was born. 'Tis a black thing (ka*n*ha) that
is born, a devil has been born!" And that is the origin, Amba*tth*a, of
the Kanhayanas s. He was the ancestor of the Ka*n*hâyanas{3}. And thus
is it, Amba*tth*a, that if one were to follow up your ancient name and
lineage, on the father's and on the mother's side, it would appear that
the Sâkyas were once your masters, and that you are the offspring of one
of their slave girls.'

   17. When he had thus spoken the young Brahmans said to the Blessed
One: 'Let not the venerable

{1. Sammanti, 'dwell,' not in Childers in this sense. But see S. I, 226
= Sum. I, 125 and *G*ât. V, 396.

2\. The oak (which doesn't grow in the text, and could not grow in the
Terai) has been introduced to enable the word play to be adequately
rendered. The Pâli S<u>a</u>ka means a teak tree.

3\. Ka*n*hâyana is the regular torm of patronymic from Ka*n*ha.

4\. Buddhaghosa gives further details as to his subsequent life.}

<span id="p. 116">{p. 116}</span>

Gotama humble Amba*tth*a too sternly with this reproach of being
descended from a slave girl. He is well born, Gotama, and of good
family; he is versed in the sacred hymns, an able reciter, a learned
man. And he is able to give answer to the venerable Gotama in these
matters.'

   18. Then the Blessed One said to them: 'Quite so. If <span
id="text p. 94">\[94\]</span> you thought otherwise, then it would be
for you to carry on our discussion further. But as you think so, let
Amba*tth*a himself speak{1}.'

   19. 'We do think so; and we will hold our peace. Amba*tth*a is able
to give answer to the venerable Gotama in these matters.'

   20. Then the Blessed One said to Amba*tth*a the Brahman: 'Then this
further question arises, Amba*tth*a, a very reasonable one which, even
though unwillingly, you should answer. If you do not give a clear reply,
or go off upon another issue{2}, or remain silent, or go away, then your
head will split in pieces on the spot{3}. What have you heard, when
Brahmans old and well stricken in years, teachers of yours or their
teachers, were talking together, as to whence the Ka*n*hâyanas draw
their origin, and who the ancestor was to whom they trace themselves
back?'

   And when he had thus spoken Amba*tth*a remained silent. And the
Blessed One asked the same question again. <span
id="text p. 95">\[95\]</span> And still Amba*tth*a remained silent. Then
the Blessed One said to him: 'You

{1. Buddhaghosa (p. 263) says that Gotama's object was to confine the
discussion to a single opponent, since if all spoke at once, it could
not well be brought to a conclusion. In the text Gotama repeats the
whole speech of the Brahmans.

2\. A*ññ*ena a*ññ*am pa*t*i*k*arasi. For this idiom, not in Childers,
see M. I, 250; Vin. I. 85; A. I, 187, 198; Mil. 94; Sum. I, 264. It is
answering one thing by alleging another.

3\. This curious threat--which never comes to anything, among the
Buddhists, and is apparently never meant to--is a frequent form of
expression in Indian books. and is pre-Buddhistic. Comp. B*ri*nad Âr.
Up. III, 6. 2 and 9. 26. Buddhist passages are M. I, 231; Dhp. 72; Dhp.
A. 87, 140; *G*ât. I, 54; V, 21, 33, 87, 92, 493, &c.}

<span id="p. 117">{p. 117}</span>

had better answer, now, Amba*tth*a. This is no time for you to hold your
peace. For whosoever, Amba*tth*a, does not, even up to the third time of
asking, answer a reasonable question put by a Tathâgata (by one who has
won the truth), his head splits into pieces on the spot.'

   21. Now at that time the spirit who bears the thunderbolt{1} stood
over above Amba*tth*a in the sky with a mighty mass of iron, all fiery,
dazzling, and aglow, with the intention, if he did not answer, there and
then to split his head in pieces. And the Blessed One perceived the
spirit bearing the thunderbolt, and so did Amba*tth*a the Brahman. And
Amba*tth*a on becoming aware of it, terrified, startled, and agitated,
seeking safety and protection and help from the Blessed One, crouched
down beside him in awe{2}, and said: 'What was it the Blessed One said?
Say it once again!'

   'What do you think, Amba*tth*a? What have you heard, when Brahmans
old and well stricken in years, teachers of yours or their teachers,
were talking together, as to whence the Ka*n*hâyanas draw their origin,
and who the ancestor was to whom they trace themselves back?'

   'Just so, Gotama, did I hear, even as the venerable Gotama hath said.
That is the origin of the Ka*n*hâyanas, and that the ancestor to whom
they trace themselves back.'

   22. And when he had thus spoken the young Brahmans fell into tumult,
and uproar, and turmoil; and said: 'Low born, they say, is Amba*tth*a
the Brahman; his family, they say, is not of good standing; they say he
is descended from a slave girl; and the Sâkyas were his masters. We did
not suppose that the Sama*n*a Gotama, whose words are righteousness
itself, was not a man to be trusted!'

   23. And the Blessed One thought: <span id="text p. 96">\[96\]</span>
'They

{1. Va*g*ira-pâ*n*î: to wit, Indra, says Buddhaghosa.

2\. Upanisîdati; whence Upanishad, a mystery, secret, listened to in
awe.}

<span id="p. 118">{p. 118}</span>

go too far, these Brahmans, in their depreciation of Amba*tth*a as the
offspring of a slave girl. Let me set him free from their reproach.' And
he said to them: 'Be not too severe in disparaging Amba*tth*a the
Brahman on the ground of his descent. That Ka*n*ha became a mighty
seer{1}. He went into the Dekkan, there he learnt mystic verses, and
returning to Okkâka the king, he demanded his daughter Madda-rûpî in
marriage. To him the king in answer said: "Who forsooth is this fellow,
who--son of my slave girl as he is--asks for my daughter in marriage;"
and, angry and displeased, he fitted an arrow to his bow. But neither
could he let the arrow fly, nor could he take it off the string
again{2}.

   'Then the ministers and courtiers went to Ka*n*ha the seer, and said:
"Let the king go safe, Sir; let the king go safe{3}."

   "The king shall suffer no harm. But should he shoot the arrow
downwards, then would the earth dry up as far as his realm extends."

   "Let the king, Sir, go safe, and the country too."

   "The king shall suffer no harm, nor his land. But should he shoot the
arrow upwards, the god would not rain for seven years as far as his
realm extends{4}."

   "Let the king, Sir, go safe, and the country too; and let the god
rain."

   "The king shall suffer no harm, nor the land either, and the god
shall rain. But let the king aim the arrow at his eldest son. The prince
shall suffer no harm, not a hair of him shall be touched."

   'Then, O Brahmans, the ministers told this to Okkâka,

{1. Rishi, mystic sage, magician being no doubt implied, as in B. V. II,
81 = *G*ât. I, 17 (verse 90). Compare Merlin.

2\. The effect of course of the charm which, Buddhaghosa tells us (p.
265), was known as the Amba*tth*a charm.

3\. Sotthi hotu. This is the old mystic word swasti. We have lost the
use of such expressions, *Faustum fac regem*.

4\. All this, says Buddhaghosa, was *brutum fulmen*. The Amba*tth*a
charm had only power to stop the arrow going off; not to work such
results as these.}

<span id="p. 119">{p. 119}</span>

and said: "Let the king aim{1} at his eldest son. He will suffer neither
harm nor terror." And the king did so, and no harm was done. But the
king, terrified at the lesson given him, <span
id="text p. 97">\[97\]</span> gave the man his daughter Madda-rûpî to
wife. You should not, O Brahmans, be too severe to disparage Amba*tth*a
in the matter of his slave-girl ancestress. That Ka*n*ha was a mighty

   24. Then the Blessed One said to Amba*tth*a: 'What think you,
Amba*tth*a? Suppose a young Kshatriya should have connection with a
Brahman maiden, and from their intercourse a son should be born. Now
would the son thus come to the Brahman maiden through the Kshatriya
youth receive a seat and water (as tokens of respect) from the
Brahmans?'

   'Yes, he would, Gotama.'

   'But would the Brahmans allow him to partake of the feast offered to
the dead, or of the food boiled in milk{2}, or of the offerings to the
gods, or of food sent as a present?'

   'Yes, they would, Gotama.'

   'But would the Brahmans teach him their verses or not?'

   'They would, Gotama.'

   'But would he be shut off, or not, from their women?'

   'He would not be shut off.'

   'But would the Kshatriyas allow him to receive the consecration
ceremony of a Kshatriya?'

   'Certainly not, Gotama.'

   'Why not that?'

   'Because he is not of pure descent on the mother's side.'

   25. 'Then what think you, Amba*tth*a? Suppose a Brahman youth should
have connection with a Kshatriya maiden, and from their intercourse a
son should be born. Now would the son thus come to the Kshatriya maiden
through the Brahman youth receive

a seat and water (as tokens of respect) from the Brahmans?'

   'Yes, he would, Gotama.'

   'But would the Brahmans allow him to partake of the feast offered to
the dead, or of food boiled in milk, or of an offering to the gods, or
of food sent as a present?'

   'Why not that?'

   'Because he is not of pure descent on the father's side.'

   26. 'Then, Amba*tth*a, whether one compares women with women, or men
with men, the Kshatriyas are higher and the Brahmans inferior.

   'And what think you, Amba*tth*a? Suppose the Brahmans, for some
offence{1} or other, were to outlaw a Brahman by shaving him and pouring

the dead, or of the food boiled in milk, or of the offerings to the
gods, or of food sent as a present?'

   'Certainly not, Gotama.'

   'And would he be shut off, or not, from their women?'

   'He would be shut off.'

   27. 'But what think you, Amba*tth*a? If the Kshatriyas had in the
same way outlawed a Kshatriya, and banished him from the land or the
township, would he, among the Brahmans, be offered water and a seat?'

   'Yes, he would, Gotama.'

   'And would he be allowed to partake of the food offered to the dead,
or of the food boiled in milk, or of the offerings to the gods, or of
food sent as a present?'

Kshatriya would have fallen into the deepest degradation, shaven as to
his head, cut dead with the ash-basket, banished from land and township.
So that, even when a Kshatriya has fallen into the deepest degradation.
still it holds good that the Kshatriyas are higher, and the Brahmans
inferior.

   28. 'Moreover it was one of the Brahmâ gods, Sana*m*-kumâra{1}, who
uttered this stanza{2}:

{1. Sana*m*-kumâra means 'ever virgin.' According to the legend--common
ground to Brahmans and Buddhists--there were five 'mind born' sons of
Brahmâ, who remained always pure and innocent, and this Brahmâ was one
of the five. See the passages quoted by Chalmers in the J. R. A. S.,
1894, p. 344.

Hofrath Bühler has pointed out that in the Mahâbhârata III, 185 (Bombay
edition) there is an interesting passage where Sanat-kumâra (the
Sanskrit form of the name Sana*m*-kumâra) is actually represented by the
Brahmans themselves as having uttered, as referee in a dispute on a
point similar to the one here discussed, not indeed the actual words
here imputed to him, but others of a very similar import. See the whole
article in the J. R. A. S., 1897, pp. 585-588. We either have in our
text a quotation from an older recension of the same legend, or one of
the two--either the Brahman editors of the Mahâbhârata, or the composers
of our Sutta--have twisted the legend a little in their own favour.

2\. The verse is a favourite one. It occurs also at M. I, 358; S. I,
153; II, 284; and below in the Agga*ññ*a Sutta.}

   "The Kshatriya is the best of those among this folk  
      who put their trust in lineage.  
   But he who is perfect in wisdom and righteousness,  
      he is the best among gods and men."  

'Now this stanza, Amba*tth*a, was well sung and not ill sung by the
Brahmâ Sana*m*-kumâra, well said and not ill said, full of meaning and
not void thereof. And I too approve it; I also, Amba*tth*a, say:

   "The Kshatriya is the best of those among this folk  
      who put their trust in lineage.  
   But he who is perfect in wisdom and righteousness,  
      he is the best among gods and men."'

back to their gotras' according as we derive the word with Childers from
%sar, or with Bühler from %smar. It occurs also in the description (Mahâ
Sudassana Sutta) of the ideal woman as ki*m*kâra-pa*t*isârinî. Bühler,
*loc. cit.*, renders it 'record their gotras.'

The next line might also be rendered 'when perfect,' &c., referring to
the Kshatriya.

4\. This question of caste, besides being often referred to in isolated
passages, is described at length also in the Assalâyana, Ka*nn*akathâla,
and Madhura Suttas, all in the Ma*ggh*ima. The first has been translated
into German by Professor Pischel and the last into English by Mr.
Chalmers, J. R. A. S., 1894, p. 341 and foll. On the facts of caste as
disclosed in the *G*âtaka book see Fick's 'Sociale Gliederung in Indien
zu Buddha's Zeit,' Kiel, 1897; and on the general history of caste in
India see Senart's 'Les Castes dans l'Inde,' Paris, 1896.}

### CHAPTER II.

   II. 1. 'But what, Gotama, is the righteousness, and what the wisdom
spoken of in that verse?'

   'In the supreme perfection in wisdom and righteousness, Amba*tth*a,
there is no reference to the question either of birth, or of lineage, or
of the pride which says: "You are held as worthy as I," or "You are not
held as worthy as I," It is where the talk is of marrying, or of giving
in marriage, that reference is made to such things as that, For
whosoever, Amba*tth*a, are in bondage to the notions of birth or of
lineage, or to the pride of social position, or of connection by
marriage, they are far from the best wisdom and righteousness. It is
only by having got rid of all such bondage that one can realise for
himself <span id="text p. 100">\[100\]</span> that supreme perfection in
wisdom and in conduct,'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   'Such a man, Amba*tth*a, is said to be perfect in wisdom, perfect in
conduct, perfect in wisdom and conduct. And there is no other perfection
in wisdom and conduct higher and sweeter than this.'

   3. 'Now, Amba*tth*a, to this supreme perfection in wisdom and
goodness <span id="text p. 101">\[101\]</span> there are Four
Leakages{2}. And what are the four?'

   'In case, Amba*tth*a, any recluse or Brahman, without having
thoroughly attained unto this supreme perfection in wisdom and conduct,
with his yoke on his shoulder (to carry fire-sticks, a water-pot,
needles, and the rest of a mendicant friar's outfit), should plunge into
the depths of the forest, vowing to himself: "I will henceforth be one
of those who live only on fruits that have fallen of themselves"--then,
verily, he turns out worthy only to be a servant unto him that hath
attained to wisdom and righteousness.

   'And again, Amba*tth*a, in case any recluse or Brahman, without
having thoroughly attained unto this supreme perfection in wisdom and
conduct, and without having attained to living only on fruits fallen of
themselves, taking a hoe and a basket with him, should plunge into the
depths of the forest, vowing to himself: "I will henceforth be one of
those who live only on bulbs and roots and fruits"--then, verily, he
turns out worthy only to be a servant unto him who hath attained to
wisdom and righteousness.

{1. There are therefore eight divisions of conduct, and eight of the
higher wisdom.

2\. Apâya-mukhâni, 'outlets, leakages, so that it cannot fill up.' The
word aya-mukha*m*, inlet, is used in its concrete sense at D. I, 74. and
both words at A. II, 166; and 'outlet' occurs figuratively, in a
secondary sense, as in this passage, in the Sigâlovâda Sutta, p. 299.}

<span id="p. 126">{p. 126}</span>

   'And again, Amba*tth*a, in case any recluse or Brahman, without
having thoroughly attained unto this supreme perfection in wisdom and
conduct, and without having attained to living only on fruits fallen of
themselves, and without having attained to living only on bulbs and
roots and fruits, should build himself a fire-shrine near the boundaries
of some village or some town, and there dwell serving the
fire-god{1}--then, verily, he turns out worthy only to be a servant unto
him that hath attained to wisdom and righteousness.

   'And again, Amba*tth*a, in case any recluse or Brahman, without
having thoroughly attained unto this supreme perfection in wisdom and
conduct, and without having attained to living only on fruits fallen of
themselves, and without having attained to living only on bulbs and
roots and fruits, and without having attained to serving the fire-god{2}
<span id="text p. 102">\[102\]</span> should build himself a four-doored
almshouse at a crossing where four high roads meet, and dwell there,
saying to himself: "Whosoever, whether recluse or Brahman, shall pass
here, from either of these four directions, him will I entertain
according to my ability and according to my power"--then, verily, he
turns out worthy only to be a servant unto him who hath attained to
wisdom and righteousness.

   'These are the Four Leakages, Amba*tth*a, to supreme perfection in
righteousness and conduct{2}.

   4. 'Now what think you, Amba*tth*a? Have you, as one of a class of
pupils under the same teacher, been instructed in this supreme
perfection of wisdom and conducts?'

   'Not that, Gotama. How little is it that I can profess

{1. For instances of this see *G*ât. I, 285, 494; II, 43. Such service
paid to a god has already been condemned in the tract on the Sîlas, the
minor details of mere morality (above, pp. 24, 25).

2\. Buddhaghosa here (p. 270) says that all sorts of Brahman ascetics
are here intended to be included, and he gives further details of eight
different sorts (discussed in the Journal of the P. T. S. for 1891, pp.
34 foll.).

to have learnt! How supreme this perfection of wisdom and conduct! Far
is it from me to have been trained therein?'

   'Then what think you, Amba*tth*a? Although you have not thoroughly
attained unto this supreme perfection of wisdom and goodness, have you
been trained to take the yoke upon your shoulders, and plunge into the
depths of the forest as one who would fain observe the vow of living
only on fruits fallen of themselves?'

   'Not even that, Gotama.'

   'Then what think you, Amba*tth*a? Although you have not attained unto
this supreme perfection of wisdom and goodness, nor have attained to
living on fruits fallen of themselves, have you been trained to take hoe
and basket, and plunge into the depths of the forest as one who would
fain observe the vow of living only on bulbs and roots and frutts?'

   'Not even that, Gotama.'

   'Then what think you, Amba*tth*a? Although you have not attained unto
this supreme perfection of wisdom and goodness, and have not attained to
living on fruits fallen of themselves, and have not attained to living
on bulbs and roots and fruits, have you been taught to build yourself a
fire-shrine on the borders of some village or some town, and dwell there
as one who would fain serve the fire-god?'

living on fruits fallen of themselves, and have not attained to living
on bulbs and roots and fruits, and have not attained to serving the

at a spot where four high roads cross, and dwell there as one who would
fain observe the vow to entertain whosoever might pass that way, from
any of the four directions, according to your ability and according to
your power?'

   'Not even that, Gotama.'

<span id="p. 128">{p. 128}</span>

   5. 'So then you, Amba*tth*a, as a pupil, have fallen short{1} of due
training, not only in the supreme wisdom and conduct, but even in any
one of the Four Leakages by which the complete attainment thereof is
debarred. And your teacher too, the Brahman Pokkharasâdi, has told you
this saying: "Who are these shavelings, sham friars, menial black
fellows, the offscouring of our kinsman's heels, that they should claim
converse with Brahmans versed in the threefold Vedic lore!"--he himself
not having even fulfilled any one even of these lesser duties (which
lead men to neglect the higher ones). See, Amba*tth*a, how deep\]y your
teacher, the Brahman Pokkharasâdi, has herein done you wrong.'

   6. 'And the Brahman Pokkharasâdi, Amba*tth*a, is in the enjoyment of
a grant from Pasenadi, the king of Kosala. But the king does not allow
him to come into his presence. When he consults with him he speaks to
him only from behind a curtain. How is it, Amba*tth*a, that the very
king, from whom he accepts this pure and lawful maintenance, King
Pasenadi of Kosala, does not admit him to his presence? See, Amba*tth*a,
how deeply your teacher, the Brahman Pokkharasâdi, has herein done you
wrong{2}.'

   7. 'Now what think you, Amba*tth*a? Suppose a king, either seated on
the neck of his elephant or on the back of his horse, or standing on the
footrug of his chariot <span id="text p. 104">\[104\]</span>, should
discuss some resolution of state with his chiefs or princes. And suppose
as he left the spot and stepped on one side, a workman (*S*ûdra) or the
slave of a workman should come up and, standing there, should discuss

{1. Parihînako sâ*k*ariyako. 'Have been done out of, neglected in the
matter of, defrauded of, this wisdom,' &c.

2\. By concealing this suggestive fact, and thereby leaving you ignorant
that the king, a Kshatriya, looked down on a Brahman, even one whom he
considered, as a Brahman, of great merit. So at *G*ât. V, 257 a king
calls a Brahman 'low born' (hîna-ga*kk*o) compared with himself.}

<span id="p. 129">{p. 129}</span>

the matter, saying: "Thus and thus said Pasenadi the king." Although he
should speak as the king might have spoken, or discuss as the king might
have done, would he thereby be the king, or even as one of his
officers?'

   'Certainly not, Gotama.'

   8. 'But just so, Amba*tth*a, those ancient poets (Rishis) of the
Brahmans, the authors of the verses, the utterers of the verses, whose
ancient form of words so chanted, uttered, or composed, the Brahmans of
to-day chant over again and rehearse, intoning or reciting exactly as
has been intoned or recited--to wit, A*tth*aka, Vâmaka, Vâmadeva,
Vessâmitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bhâradvaga, Vâse*tth*a, Kassapa, and
Bhagu{1}--though you can say: "I, as a pupil, know by heart their
verses," that you should on that account be a Rishi, or have attained to
the state of a Rishi--such a condition of things has no existence!'

   9. 'Now what think you, Amba*tth*a? What have you heard when
Brahmans, old and well stricken in years, teachers of yours or their
teachers, were talking together--did those ancient Rishis, whose verses
you so chant over and repeat, parade about well groomed, perfumed,
trimmed as to their hair and beard, adorned with garlands and gems, clad
in white garments, in the full possession and enjoyment of the five
pleasures of sense, as you, and your teacher too, do now?'

   <span id="text p. 105">\[105\]</span> 'Not that, Gotama.'

   'Or did they live, as their food, on boiled rice of the best sorts,
from which all the black specks had been sought out and removed, and
flavoured with sauces and curries of various kinds, as you, and your
teacher too, do now?'

   'Not that, Gotama.'

   'Or were they waited upon by women with fringes

<span class="small">{1. On these names see Tevi*gg*a Sutta [I,

and furbelows{1} round their loins, as you, and your teacher too, do
now?'

   'Or did they go about driving chariots, drawn by mares with plaited
manes and tails{2}, using long wands and goads the while, as you, and
your teacher too, do now?'

   'Not that, Gotama.'

   'Or did they have themselves guarded in fortified towns, with moats
dug out round them{3} and crossbars let down before the gates{4}, by men
girt with long swords, as you, and your teacher too, do now?'

   'Not that, Gotama.'

   10. 'So then, Amba*tth*a, neither are you a Rishi, nor your teacher,
nor do you live under the conditions under which the Rishis lived. But
whatever it may be, Amba*tth*a, concerning which you are in doubt or
perplexity about me, ask me as to that. I will make it clear by
explanation.'

   11. Then the Blessed One went forth from his chamber, and began to
walk up and down. And Amba*tth*a did the same. And as he thus walked

{1. Ve*th*aka-nata-passâhi. We have here probably the ancient name of
the very elaborate girdles which all the fashionable women and goddesses
wear on the old bas reliefs. Cunningham, 'Stûpa or Bharhut,' Pl. LI,
gives figures and details of them. To judge from the bas reliefs--and I
cannot call to mind any Pi*t*aka passage contradicting them--the women
(lay women of course, the Sisterhood wore robes from the shoulders
downwards) have only very elaborate headdresses and necklaces, a skirt
from the waist to the ankles, and a very broad and handsome girdle worn
over the top of the skirt. They were unclothed from the neck to the
waist.

2\. Kutta-vâlehi. The chariot of the time, as represented on the bas
reliefs, had standing room for four passengers, the steeds wore plumes
on their heads, and had their manes and tails elaborately plaited.
'Stûpa of Bharhut,' Pl. XII, shows us the chariot of Pasenadi, king of
Kosala (see ibid. pp. 124, 125). Kutta is not in Childers. But it occurs
frequently. See *G*ât. I, 296, 433; II, 127, 128; IV, 219; Asl.321.

3\. Compare *G*ât. IV, 106; Mil. 330.

4\. Okkhitta-palighâsu. Childers says (following the Sanskrit
dictionaries) bars 'of iron.' But where does the iron come in? This is
surely a modern improvement. Unfortunately the word is found elsewhere
(M. I, 139; A. III, 84; Dhp. 398) only in an ethical sense.}

<span id="p. 131">{p. 131}</span>

up and down, following the Blessed One, he took stock of the thirty-two
signs of a great man, whether they appeared on the body of the Blessed
One or not. And he perceived them all save only two. <span
id="text p. 106">\[106\]</span> With respect to those two--the concealed
member and the extent of tongue{1}--he was in doubt and perplexity, not
satisfied, not sure.

   12. And the Blessed One knew that he was so in doubt. And he so
arranged matters by his Wondrous Gift that Amba*tth*a the Brahman saw
how that part of the Blessed One that ought to be hidden by clothes was
enclosed in a sheath. And the Blessed One so bent round his tongue that
he touched and stroked both his ears, touched and stroked both his
nostrils, and the whole circumference of his forehead he covered with
his tongue{2}.

{1. Neither text nor commentary make it clear what these two marks
really quite meant. The first, says Buddhaghosa, is 'like an
elephant's,' and the second seems, from what follows, to be the power of
extending the tongue, like a snake's, to a great length. This last is
possibly derived from poetical descriptions of the tongues of flame or
light playing round the disk of the sun.

As to the means by which the Buddha made the first visible to
Amba*tth*a, Buddhaghosa simply quotes Nâgasena (at Mil. 169) to show
that he made a visible image of himself fully dressed in his robes. And
the difficulty is to see how that would have helped matters. Only an
historical explanation of the meaning of the marks can here guide us to
what is inferred.

2\. These are two of the thirty-two bodily marks of a Great Being
(Mahâ-purisa), as handed down among the Brahmans (see note above, [p.
88](#text%20p.%2088) of the text, § 5.md) and adopted by the Buddhists.
They are in part adaptations to a man of poetical epithets applied to
the sun, or to the personification of the mystic human sacrifice; partly
characteristics of personal beauty such as any man might have; and one
or two of them--the little wart, for instance, between the eyes with
white hair on it, and the protuberance at the top of the head--may
possibly be added in reminiscence of personal bodily peculiarities which
Gotama actually had.

One of the Dialogues in the Dîgha, the Lakha*n*a Sutta, is devoted to
these thirty-two marks. They are also enumerated, with slight
differences, in the Mahâpadhâna Sutta; and later books give other lists
differing from each other, and from the old lists, in many small points.
The story told here in §§ 11, 12 recurs in identical words in the Sela
Sutta (S. N. No. 33 = M. No. 92) and forms the subject of one of the
dilemmas put by King Milinda to Nâgasena (Mil 167).}

   And Amba*tth*a, the young Brahman, thought: 'The Sama*n*a Gotama is
endowed with the thirty-two signs of a great man, with them all, not
only with some of them.' And he said to the Blessed One: 'And now,
Gotama, we would fain depart. We are busy, and have much to do.'

   'Do, Amba*tth*a, what seemeth to you fit.'

   And Amba*tth*a mounted his chariot drawn by mares, and departed
thence.

   13. Now at that time the Brahman Pokkharasâdi had gone forth from
Ukka*tth*a with a great retinue of Brahmans, and was seated in his own
pleasaunce waiting there for Amba*tth*a. And Amba*tth*a came on to the
pleasaunce. And when he had come in his chariot as far as the path was
practicable for chariots, he descended from it, and came on foot to
where Pokkharasâdi was, and saluted him, and took his seat respectfully
on one side. And when he was so seated, Pokkharasâdi said to him:

   14. 'Well, Amba*tth*a! Did you see the Blessed One?'

   'Yes, Sir, we saw him.'

   'Well! is the venerable Gotama so as the reputation <span
id="text p. 107">\[107\]</span> about him I told you of declares; and
not otherwise. Is he such a one, or is he not?'

   'He is so, Sir, as his reputation declares, and not otherwise. Such
is he, not different. And he is endowed with the thirty-two signs of a
great man, with all of them, not only with some.'

   'And did you have any talk, Amba*tth*a, with the Sama*n*a Gotama?'

   'Yes, Sir, I had.'

   'And how did the talk go?'

   Then Amba*tth*a told the Brahman Pokkharasâdi all the talk that he
had had with the Blessed One.

   15. When he had thus spoken, Pokkharasâdi said to him: 'Oh! you
wiseacre! Oh I you dullard! Oh! you

<span id="p. 133">{p. 133}</span>

expert, forsooth, in our threefold Vedic lore! A man, they say, who
should carry out his business thus, must, on the dissolution of the
body, after death, be reborn into some dismal state of misery and woe.
What could the very points you pressed in your insolent words lead up
to, if not to the very disclosures the venerable Gotama made{1}? What a
wiseacre; what a dullard; what an expert, forsooth, in our threefold
Vedic lore.' And angry and displeased, he struck out with his foot, and
rolled Amba*tth*a over. And he wanted, there and then, himself, to go
and call on the Blessed One.

   <span id="text p. 108">\[108\]</span> 16. But the Brahmans there
spake thus to Pokkharasâdi: 'It is much too late, Sir, to-day to go to
call on the Sama*n*a Gotama. The venerable Pokkharasâdi can do so
to-morrow.'

   So Pokkharasâdi had sweet food, both hard and soft, made ready at his
own house, and taken on wagons, by the light of blazing torches, out to
Ukka*tth*a. And he himself went on to the I*kkh*ânankala Wood, driving
in his chariot as far as the road was practicable for vehicles, and then
going on, on foot, to where the Blessed One was. And when he had
exchanged with the Blessed One the greetings and compliments of
politeness and courtesy, he took his seat on one side, and said to the
Blessed One:

   17. 'Has our pupil, Gotama, the young Brahman Amba*tth*a, been here?'

   'Yes, Brahman, he has.'

   'And did you, 'Gotama, have any talk with him?'

   'Yes, Brahman, I had:

   'And on what wise was the talk that you had with him:

   18. Then the Blessed One told the Brahman Pokkharasâdi all the talk
that had taken place. And when

<span class="small">{l. Âsa*gg*a âsa*gg*a . . . upanîyya upanîyya.
Buddhaghosa is somewhat ambiguous in his interpretation of this
idiomatic phrase, on which compare M. I, 250, 251; A. I, 172.}</span>

<span id="p. 134">{p. 134}</span>

he had thus spoken Pokkharasâdi said to the Blessed One:

   'He is young and foolish, Gotama, that young Brahman Amba*tth*a.
Forgive him, Gotama.'

   'Let him be quite happy, Brahman, that young Brahman Amba*tth*a.'

   <span id="text p. 109">\[109\]</span> 19. And the Brahman
Pokkharasâdi took stock, on the body of the Blessed One, of the
thirty-two marks of a Great Being. And he saw them all plainly, save
only two. As to two of them--the sheath-concealed member and the
extensive tongue--he was still in doubt and undecided. But the Blessed
One showed them to Pokkharasâdi, even as he had shown them to
Amba*tth*a{1}. And Pokkharasâdi perceived that the Blessed One was
endowed with the thirty-two marks of a Great Being, with all of them,
not only with some. And he said to the Blessed One: 'May the venerable
Gotama grant me the favour of taking his to-morrow's meal with me, and
also the members of the Order with him.' And the Blessed One accepted,
by silence, his request.

   20. Then the Brahman Pokkharasâdi, seeing that the Blessed One had
accepted, had (on the morrow) the time announced to him: 'It is time, oh
Gotama, the meal is ready.' And the Blessed One, who had dressed in the
early morning, put on his outer robe, and taking his bowl with him,
went, with the brethren, to Pokkharasâdi's house, and sat down on the
seat prepared for him. And Pokkharasâdi, the Brahman, satisfied the
Blessed One, with his own hand, with sweet food, both hard and soft,
until he refused any more, and the young Brahmans the members of the
Order. And when the Blessed One had finished his meal, and cleansed the
bowl and his{2} hands, Pokkharasâdi took a low seat, and sat down beside
him.

   21. Then to him thus seated <span id="text p. 110">\[110\]</span> the
Blessed One

{1. Above, [p. 106](#text%20p.%20106.md) of the text, § 12 repeated.

2\. Onîta-patta-pâ*n*i*m*. See the note at 'Vinaya Texts,' I, 83.}

<span id="p. 135">{p. 135}</span>

discoursed in due order; that is to say, he spake to him of generosity,
of right conduct, of heaven, of the danger, the vanity, and the
defilement of lusts, of the advantages of renunciation. And when the
Blessed One saw that Pokkharasâdi, the Brahman, had become prepared,
softened, unprejudiced, upraised, and believing in heart, then he
proclaimed the doctrine the Buddhas alone have won; that is to say, the
doctrine of sorrow, of its origin, of its cessation, and of the Path.
And just as a clean cloth from which all stain has been washed away will
readily take the dye, just even so did Pokkharasâdi, the Brahman,
obtain, even while sitting there, the pure and spotless. Eye for the
Truth, and he knew: 'Whatsoever has a beginning in that is inherent also
the necessity of dissolution.

   22. And then the Brahman Pokkharasâdi, as one who had seen the Truth,
had mastered it, understood it, dived deep down into it, who had passed
beyond doubt and put away perplexity and gained full confidence, who had
become dependent on no other man for his knowledge of the teaching of
the Master, addressed the Blessed One, and said:

   'Most excellent, oh Gotama (are the words of thy mouth), most
excellent! Just as if a man were to set up that which has been thrown
down, or were to reveal that which has been hidden away, or were to
point out the right road to him who has gone astray, or were to bring a
light into the darkness so that those who had eyes could see external
forms,--just even so, Lord, has the truth been made known to me, in many
a figure, by the venerable Gotama. And I, oh Gotama, with my sons, and
my wife, and my people, and my companions, betake myself to the
venerable Gotama as my guide, to the truth, and to the Order. May the
venerable Gotama accept me as a disciple, as one who from this day
forth, as long as life endures, has taken him as his guide. And just as
the venerable Gotama visits the families of others, his disciples, at
Ukka*tth*a, so let him visit

<span id="p. 136">{p. 136}</span>

mine. Whosoever there may be there, of Brahmans or their wives, who
shall pay reverence to the venerable Gotama, or stand up in his
presence, or offer him a seat or water, or take delight in him, to him
that will be, for long, a cause of weal and bliss.'

   'It is well, Brahman, what you say.'
