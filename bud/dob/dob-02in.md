### INTRODUCTION

##### TO THE

### SÂMA*ÑÑ*A-PHALA SUTTA.

   THE first Dialogue deals with the most fundamental conceptions that
lay at the root of the Buddha's doctrine, his Dharma, his ethical and
philosophical view of life--the second puts forth his justification for
the foundation of the Order, for the enunciation of the Vinaya, the
practical rules of canon law by which life in the Order is regulated.
The Rules themselves are not discussed. It is only certain ethical
precepts that are referred to in so many words. The question is a larger
and wider one than the desirability of any particular injunction. It is
as to the advantage, as to the use, of having any Order at all.

   King A*g*âtasattu of Magadha, after pointing out the advantages
derived from their occupations by a long list of ordinary people in the
world, asks whether the members of the Order, who have given up the
world, derive any corresponding advantage, visible in this life, from
theirs. The answer is a list of such advantages, arranged in an
ascending scale of importance, each one mentioned being said to be
better and sweeter than the one just before described.

   The list of ordinary occupations given in the question is interesting
evidence, especially as compared with the later lists of a similar kind
referred to in the notes, of social conditions in the Ganges valley at
the time when this Dialogue was composed. And the introductory story, in
which the king explains how he had put a similar question to the
founders of six other orders, and gives the six replies he received, is
interesting evidence of the views held by the authors of the Dialogue as
to beliefs current at the time.

   The replies are no less interesting from the fact, pointed out by the
king, that they are not to the point. Each of the six teachers goes off
into a general statement of his theory instead of answering the question
put. But as the works, if any, of all these teachers save
one--Niga*nth*a Nâta-putta--have been irretrievably lost, the summary
here given of their doctrines is of great importance as evidence of the
sort of

<span id="p. 57">{p. 57}</span>

speculation they favoured. The six paragraphs are short and obscure, and
this is just what we should expect. As is the case with the accounts
given by early Catholic writers of opinions they held to be heretical,
the versions of these six sets of belief are neither adequate nor clear.
But a number of other references to these six theories are found, as
pointed out in the notes, both in the Buddhist and in the *G*ain
records. And it would be premature to discuss our six paragraphs until
the whole of the available evidence is made accessible to scholars. It
is noteworthy that in at least two of these answers some of the
expressions used seem to be in a Prâkrit differing in dialect from the
Pâli of the Pi*t*akas. And these are not the only instances of the
preservation in the Pi*t*akas of ancient dialectical varieties.

   The answer which the Buddha is represented to have given, in his
turn, to the question raised by the king, takes (as is so often the
case) the form of a counter-question. 'The very man whom, under ordinary
circumstances, you would treat as slave or servant--what treatment would
you mete out to him after he had joined an Order?' The king confesses
that he would treat him as a person worthy of honour and respect. And
neither in question nor answer is there any reference specially to the
Buddhist Order. It is taken for granted, alike by the Buddha and the
king, that any one who had devoted himself to the religious life,
whatever the views or opinions he held, or the association he had
joined, would, in accordance with the remarkable tolerance of that age
and country, be treated with equal respect and courtesy. And the same
note runs all through the Dialogue. The Buddha shows the advantages of
the 'life of a recluse,' not necessarily of a follower of his own. And
most of what he says would apply as much to his strongest opponents as
to the members of his own Order.

   The following, in a constantly ascending order of merit, are the
advantages, visible in this life, which he claims for such a recluse:--

   1. The honour and respect shown to a member of a religious order.

   2. The training in all those lower kinds of mere morality set out in
the very ancient document called 'The Sîlas.' The importance of this
document has been discussed above, in the Introduction to the
Brahma-*g*âla. The details of it may be summarised here as follows:--

<span class="small">{1. Details *a*-*d* (though the fact is not referred
to here) are the opposites of the three bad acts of the body, and the
four bad acts of speech, kâya- and va*k*î-du*kk*aritâni, so often
referred to in the Suttas, and in the Abhidhamma. The three others (of
the mind), making up the ten given in my manual, p. 142, are omitted
here because they belong to the higher morality.}</span>

   13. The realisation of the Four Truths, the destruction of the
Âsavas, and attainment of Arahatship; §§ 97, 98.

   Now it is perfectly true that of these thirteen consecutive
propositions, or groups of propositions, it is only the last, No. 13,
which is exclusively Buddhist. But the things omitted, the union of the
whole of those included into one system, the order in which the ideas
are arranged, the way in which they are treated as so many steps of a
ladder whose chief value depends on the fact that it leads up to the
culminating point of Nirvâ*n*a in Arahatship--all this is also
distinctively Buddhist. And further, the whole statement, the details of
it, the order of it, must have soaked very thoroughly into the minds of
the early Buddhists. For we find the whole, or nearly the whole, of it
repeated (with direct reference by name to our Sutta as the oldest and
most complete enumeration of it) not only in all the subsequent
dialogues translated in this volume, but also in many others.

   In these repetitions the order is always the same, and the details
(so far as they occur) are the same. Kut one or other of the thirteen
groups is often omitted, and the application of those of them that
remain is always different--that is to say, they are enumerated in
support, or in illustration; of a different proposition.

   A comparison of some of these other applications of the list is full
of suggestion as to its real meaning here.

   In the Amba*tth*a the point is as to caste. The Kshatriya caste is
the most honourable, but wisdom and conduct are higher still. What then
is the right conduct, what the right

<span class="small">{1. Buddhaghosa (p. 219) says that though the Four
Arûpa Vimokkhas are not explicitly mentioned they are to be understood
(thus making up the Eight Samâpattis). This may be so: but it looks like
a later writer reading his own opinion into the older text. They are put
into the text at Po*tth*apada, pp. 183, 184, and it is difficult to see
why they should not have been also inserted here, if they were really
implied.}</span>

<span id="p. 60">{p. 60}</span>

wisdom? The conduct (*k*ara*n*a) is all the above paragraphs from 2-9
inclusive; the wisdom (vi*gg*â) is the rest, 10-13{1}.

   In the So*n*ada*nd*a the question is: 'What is the true Brahman?'
After, by his usual Socratic method, leading So*n*ada*nd*a to
acknowledge that the only two essential requisites are goodness and
intelligence, these last are explained as above (2-9 and 10-13).

   In the Kû*t*adanta the question is as to the right sort of sacrifice.
After rejecting animal sacrifice we have generosity (of various kinds,
each better than the last), faith, training in the precepts, and 2-13,
set forth as each of them abetter sacrifice than the last.

   In the *G*âliya the question is whether the soul is the same as, or
is other than, the body. The answer is a counter-question. Repeating our
sections 2-13 (omitting 11 and 12) the Buddha asks, at the end of each
subdivision, whether men who do that would be likely to trouble
themselves as to speculations about the soul? And the answer being, of
course, 'No,' rejoins that neither does he.

   In the Po*tth*apâda the question is as to the way in which various
recluses attain to mystic trance. The Buddha's answer is that it is by
training; and the training should be first in morals (our groups 2 and
3) then in the things mentioned in our groups 4-9, and then in the Four
Arûpa Vimokkhas. The Dialogue then takes up other questions, omitting
our groups 10-13.

   In the Keva*ddh*a the talk is on miracles, mystic powers. And the
Buddha, disparaging all others, calls attention to our groups 2-13.

   In the Lohi*kk*a the question is as to who is the right sort of
teacher; and the answer is that it is the one whose pupil carries out
our groups 2-13.

   In the Tevi*gg*a the question is as to the way by which one can
attain to union with God (Brahmâ-sahavyatâ). The answer gives our groups
1-8, and then adds the Four Brahma-vihâras.

   In the shorter of the two Hatthipadopama Suttas

<span class="small">{1. Possibly Nos. 11 and 12 are meant, both here and
in all the other Suttas, to be omitted. The wording is ambiguous.
Buddhaghosa, who talks here (see p. 268) of Nos. 10-13 as the Eightfold
pa*ññ*â, apparently means to include them (he could not otherwise get
eight). But the argument of the Mahâli seems to exclude them. The texts
always jump from the last words of 10 to the last words of 13. Now as in
the Mahâli No. 12 is excluded, it is clear that at least there only Nos.
10 and 13 are meant. And there is no difference between tile phraseology
in the Mahâli and that used in the other Suttas.}</span>

(No. 27 in the Ma*ggh*ima), the question discussed between a Brahman and
an ascetic is as to the ascendancy of the Buddha over the other teachers
of the time. The Buddha himself giving afterwards the full reason,
repeats our group 2 (omitting however clauses *f* to *p* inclusive{1}),
then repeats our groups 6, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, then omitting groups 1O and
11, quotes two only, the last two (omitting the first three){2} of the
five Abhi*ññ*âs in group 12, and concludes with group 13 in full.

   In the Mahâ Ta*n*hâ-sa<u>n</u>khaya Sutta (No. 38 in the Ma*ggh*ima),
we have the same sequence--our group 2 (omitting *f* to *p*), then 6, 3,
4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. The rest is omitted.

   In the next Sutta, the longer of the Assapuras, after a summary in
different words of most of the contents of our group 2, we have our
group 4, then two paragraphs not in our Sutta, then our groups 5, 7, 8,
9, and the last two only out of group 12, and then (as a climax) our
group 13--all enumerated to show what is the true Brahman, the true
sama*n*a.

   Then again in the Sakuludâyi, No. 79 of the Ma*ggh*ima, it is
declared to be not for the sake of realising happiness that recluses
take up the celibate life in the Order under the Buddha; but for the
sake of those matters set forth in our groups 2-9 inclusive 3, of the
two last of the Abhi*ññ*âs, and above all for the sake of the attainment
of Arahatship.

   Besides the differences pointed out above between the Suttas
preserved in the Digha, and in the Ma*ggh*ima, respectively--differences
due, I think, solely to the difference in the subjects under
discussion--there are also a few verbal differences, amounting to
scarcely more than 'various readings,' due, perhaps, to the divergent
traditions of the Digha-bhâ*n*akâ and the Ma*ggh*ima-bhâ*n*akâ (the
students and repeaters of the two collections in which the Dialogues are
handed down to us).

   However this may be, it is clear that the sum and the sequence of the
paragraphs in our Sutta is regarded as of

{1. From which we may infer that, as respects those matters, he saw no
difference between himself and the other teachers.

2\. So that the power of Iddhi, of hearing heavenly sounds, and of
knowing other people's thoughts, are apparently supposed to be common
ground between the Buddhists and the other sects. They are included in
our Sutta because they are supposed to be part of the advantage of life
in an Order--in any Order, that is, not only the Buddhist.

3\. Ma*ggh*ima II, 37, 38. Perhaps the pe is meant to be supplied from
the twenty-seventh Sutta just quoted--the difference, however, as we
have seen, is not of great importance.}

<span id="p. 62">{p. 62}</span>

great importance, not as a statement of Buddliist ethics, or of Buddhist
philosophy, or of the Buddhist religion, but as a statement of the
advantages that may be looked for as the result of life in an Order. And
further that the statement has to be slightly modified and shortened
when the question is the narrower one of life in the particular
community which we call the Buddhist Order.

   The difference is interesting--in the scheme for the Buddhist Order
the *ñ*â*n*a-dassana, the power of projecting a mental image (apparently
of oneself, which seems like the earliest germ of the modern Yoga ideas
about the astral body), the powers of Iddhi, the power of hearing
heavenly sounds (something like hearing the music of the spheres), and
the power of knowing the thoughts of others, are all omitted.

   In the abstract given above, I have called these last three, together
with the power of calling to mind one's own, and other peoples',
previous births, the Five Abhi*ññ*âs, or Intuitions. And this is in
accord with the passages on which Childers's article *sub voce* is
based. But these powers are not so called either in our text, or in any
other Dialogue yet published. The use of the word abhi*ññ*â in this
technical sense would seem therefore (to judge from the published texts)
to be a sign of the later date of the book in which it occurs{1}. In the
oldest portions of the Pi*t*akas the word is always used in the general
sense of insight, and if any special limitation is hinted at, it is
simply the insight of Arahatship that is emphasised (as in Dhammapada
423, which is a quotation from Iti-Vuttaka, No. 99, and is quoted also
at A<u>n</u>guttara I, 165){2}.

   The Eightfold Path is not mentioned in our Sutta. This is not merely
because it is not possible always to mention

{1. The oldest case of the technical use of the word, so far as I know.
is in the introductory story of the Mahâ Vibha<u>n</u>ga on the fourth
Pârâ*g*ika (Vin. III, 87). This is later than the Old Commentary on the
Pâtimokkha, from which it incorporates many passages, and this again is
later, of course, than the Pâtimokkha itself.

Neither the Five nor the Six Abhi*ññ*âs are given as groups among the
groups of Fives and Sixes in the A<u>n</u>guttara. The word Abhi*ññ*â is
used in the divisions containing the Fives and Sixes exclusively in its
ordinary sense (III, 277, 451; comp. IV, 348). And this is the more
instructive as what were afterwards called the Six Abhi*ññ*âs are
actually given in full (IV, 17-19, §§ 6-11) in the same words as in the
Âka<u>n</u>kheyya Sutta. (No. 6 of the Ma*ggh*ima, translated in my
'Buddhist Suttas'), and very nearly as in our Sutta, here under
discussion. But they are not called Abhi*ññ*âs.

2\. Compare also A. I, 100; II, 249; III, 3, 9, 277.}

<span id="p. 63">{p. 63}</span>

everything. The Path does not come within the special advantages of life
in the Order. To enter upon the Path to Arahatship, to walk along it, is
not peculiar to members of the Order. A bhikshu might reach the goal
either along that path, open also to laymen{1}, or by the process set
out in our Sutta. They are two quite distinct methods of training, of
which our Sutta deals only with one

   It is essential, in order to understand Buddhist ethics, to bear in
mind that there are (and must be in such a system) several different
lines along which both speculation and edifying teaching run. These are:

   1. The course of conduct laid down for the ordinary Buddhist layman,
contained in the Gahapati-vaggas found in the various nikâyas{2}.

   2. The rules as to the outward conduct of the members of the Order,
laid down in the Pâtimokkha and in the Khandhakas{3}.

   3. The system of self-training in higher things prescribed for
members of the Order. Of this our present Sutta is a striking example.

   4. The method of self-training laid down for those who have entered
upon the Path to Arahatship. (The Four Truths, the Eightfold Path, and
the Âsavas.)

   In the first of these Buddhism goes very little beyond the current
ethics of the day. In the second a very great deal has been simply
incorporated from the rules found expedient by previous recluses, both
Brahman and non-Brahman, though there are numerous differences, both of
the positive regulations included, and also of things deliberately
omitted. Even the third, as we have seen, cannot be considered, except
in a very limited sense, as exclusively Buddhist. It is in the fourth
that the essential doctrines of Buddhism are to be found. All four have,
no doubt, become welded together into a more or less consistent whole.
But to understand the whole, the relation of its various parts has to be
kept constantly in view.

   This will explain an apparent contradiction. The last Sutta quoted,
the Sakuludâyi, states that the aim of the religious or celibate life as
led in the Buddha's Order, is the attainment, in order, of the various
things set out in our Sutta (groups 2-9, 12 and 13).

{1. For a list of twenty-one laymen Arahats see A. III, 451; and there
are other instances recorded.

2\. A good summary of this is in the Sigâlovada Sutta, an abstract of
which is given in my Manual, pp. 143 foll.

3\. Translated in 'Vinaya Texts' (S. B. E.).}

<span id="p. 64">{p. 64}</span>

   Now in other passages other things are stated to be the aim.

   Thus in the Samyutta (IV, 51) the Buddha himself is represented as
explaining that the celibate life (the brahma-*k*ariyâ){1} is led by his
followers for the sake of the complete understanding of pain
(dukkha-pari*ññ*â). Further on in the same book (VI, 253 = V, 6, 27)
this is three times repeated, with the suggestive addition that there is
one way to this, to wit, the Noble Eightfold Path.

   Again, in the A<u>n</u>guttara (IV, 7) the higher life is said to be
for the sake of getting rid of, of cutting through, seven Bonds which
prevent one from attaining Arahatship. The argument on pp. 88, 99
(though the word brahma-*k*ariyâ does not occur) comes to much the same
thing. And further on in the same book (IV, 272) the object is stated to
be for the sake of getting rid of five particular sorts of envy.

   Nâgasena is therefore quite right when he says that the object of
renouncing the world to live in the Order is for the sake of
righteousness and peace{2}; and in another place that it is to the end
that sorrow may pass away{3}. All these explanations belong to the Path,
not to the rules of the Order. They are not really inconsistent with the
other aim that our Sutta sets out. And they are only additional proof,
if such were needed, that it is no more possible to sum up in a single
phrase (as some writers have tried to do) the aim of Buddhism, or the
object of life in the Order, than it would be to sum up in a similar way
the aim of Christianity, or the object for which men enter a Christian
Order. The aims are necessarily as various as the character and
circumstances of the various individuals who take them up. And Nâgasena
does not hesitate to add--and to add in speaking to a king--that some
had joined the Order in terror at the tyranny of kings, some in fear of
robbers, some because they were harassed by debt, and some perhaps
merely to gain a livelihood.

   This also would apply to other Orders both in India and elsewhere,
and is quite consistent with our Sutta, which only purports to set forth
the advantages the early Buddhists held to be the likely results of
joining, from whatever motive, such an Order as their own.

{1. That is, of course, 'the best course of life' with the connotation
of celibacy. The German 'Wandel' is a good rendering of *K*ariyâ. We
have no expression so good. See Sa*m*yutta V, 16, 17.
