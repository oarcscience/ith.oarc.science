## XIII. TEVI*GG*A SUTTA.

### \[ON KNOWLEDGE OF THE VEDAS<sup><span class="small">{1}</span></sup>.\]

   <span id="text p. 235">\[235\]</span> 1. Thus have I heard. When the
Exalted One was once journeying through Kosala with a great company of
the brethren, with about five hundred brethren, he came to the Brahman
village in Kosala which is called Manasâka*t*a. And there at
Manasâka*t*a the Exalted One stayed in the mango grove, on the bank of
the river A*k*iravatî, to the north of Manasâka*t*a.

   2. Now at that time many very distinguished and wealthy Brahmans were
staying at Manasâka*t*a; to wit, Kankî the Brahman, Târukkha the
Brahman, Pokkharasâdi the Brahman, *G*â*n*usso*n*i the Brahman, Todeyya
the Brahman, and other very distinguished and wealthy Brahmans{2}.

{1. This Suttanta was translated from the MSS. in my 'Buddhist Suttas'
(S. B. E., 1881). Since then the text has been published by the Pâli
Text Society; and alterations and amendments in a number of details have
been rendered necessary.

2\. Buddhaghosa says that--  
   Ka<u>n</u>kî lived at Opasâda,  
   Târukkha lived at I*kkh*agala (so MSS., perhaps for
I*kkh*ânangala),  
   Pokkharasâdi (*sic* MS.) lived at Ukka*tth*a,  
   Gâ*n*usso*n*i lived at Savatthi, and  
   Todeyya lived at Tudigama.

*G*â*n*usso*n*i was converted by the Bhaya-bherava Sutta. On
Pokkharasâdi, see above, pp. [108](dob-03tx.md),
[135](dob-03tx.htm#p.%20135), [147](dob-04tx.htm#p.%20147.md); and on
Todeyya, see above, [p. 267](dob-10tx.md); and on all the names, see
Ma*ggh*ima Nikaya, No. 98 = Sutta Nipata III, 9.

Buddhaghosa adds that because Manasâka*t*a was a pleasant place the
Brahmans had built huts there on the bank of the river and fenced them
in, and used to go and stay there from time to time to repeat their
mantras.}

<span id="p. 301">{p. 301}</span>

   3. Now a conversation sprung up between Vâse*tth*a and Bhâradvâ*g*a,
when they were taking exercise (after their bath) and walking up and
down in thoughtful mood, as to which was the true path, and which the
false{1}.'

   4. The young Brahman Vâse*tth*a spake thus:

   'This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for
salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of
union with Brahmâ. I mean that which has been announced by the Brahman
Pokkharasâdi.'

   5. The young Brahman Bhâradvâ*g*a spake thus:

   'This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for
salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of
union with Brahmâ. <span id="text p. 236">\[236\]</span> I mean that
which has been announced by the Brahman Târukkha.'

   6. But neither was the young Brahman Vâse*tth*a able to convince the
young Brahman Bhâradvâ*g*a, nor was the young Brahman Bhâradvâ*g*a able
to convince the young Brahman Vâse*tth*a.

   7. Then the young Brahman Vâse*tth*a said to the young Brahman
Bhâradvâ*g*a:

   'That Sama*n*a Gotama, Bhâradvâ*g*a, of the sons of the Sâkyas, who
went out from the Sâkya clan to adopt the religious life, is now staying
at Manasâka*t*a, in the mango grove, on the bank of the river
A*k*iravatî, to the north of Manasâka*t*a. Now regarding that venerable
Gotama, such is the high reputation that has been noised abroad: "That
Exalted One is an Arahat, a fully enlightened one, abounding in wisdom
and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a
guide to mortals willing to be led, a teacher of gods and men, an
Exalted One, a Buddha."

<span class="small">{1. Ga<u>n</u>ghâvihâra*m*
anu*k*a<u>n</u>kamantâna*m* anuvi*k*arantâna*m*. *K*a<u>n</u>kamati is
to walk up and down thinking. I have added 'after their bath,' from
Buddhaghosa, who says that this must be understood to have taken place
when, after learning by heart and repeating all day, they, went down in
the evening to the riverside to bathe, and then walked up and down on
the sand. Comp. Mil. 22; *G*ât. II, 240, 272.}</span>

<span id="p. 302">{p. 302}</span>

Come, then, Bhâradvâ*g*a, let us go to the place where the Sama*n*a
Gotama is; and when we have come there, let us ask the Sama*n*a Gotama
touching this. matter. What the Sama*n*a Gotama shall declare unto us,
that let us bear in mind{1}.'

   'Very well, my friend!' said the young Brahman Bhâradvâ*g*a, in
assent, to the young Brahman Vâse*tth*a.

   8. Then the young Brahman Vâse*tth*a and the young Brahman
Bhâradvâ*g*a went on to the place where the Exalted One was.

   And when they had come there, they exchanged with the Exalted One the
greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy, and sat down
beside him. And while they were thus seated the young Brahman Vâse*tth*a
said to the Exalted One:

   'As we, Gotama, were taking exercise and walking up and down, there
sprung up a conversation between us on which was the true path, and
which the false. I said thus:

   '"This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for
salvation, and leads him who acts according to it, into a state of union
with Brahmâ. I mean that which has been announced by the Brahman
Pokkharasâdi."'

   'Bhâradvâ*g*a said thus:

   '"This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for
salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of
union with Brahmâ. I mean that which has been announced by the Brahman
Târukkha."'

   'Regarding this matter, Gotama, there is a strife, a dispute, a
difference of opinion between us.' <span id="text p. 237">\[237\]</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   9. 'So you say, Vâse*tth*a, that you said thus:

   '"This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for
salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of
union with Brahmâ.

<span class="small">{1. Comp. Divyâvadâna 196, 246; and A<u>n</u>guttara
II, pp. 23, 24.}</span>

<span id="p. 303">{p. 303}</span>

I mean that which has been announced by the Brahman Pokkharasâdi."'

   'While Bhâradvâ*g*a said thus:

   '"This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for
salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of
union with Brahmâ. I mean that which has been announced by the Brahman
Târukkha."'

   'Wherein, then, O Vâse*tth*a, is there a strife, a dispute, a
difference of opinion between you{1}?'

   10. 'Concerning the true path and the false, Gotama. Various
Brahmans, Gotama, teach various paths. The Addhariyâ Brahmans, the
Tittiriyâ Brahmans, the *Kh*andokâ Brahmans \[the *Kh*andavâ Brahmans\],
the Bavhari*g*â Brahmans{2}. Are all those saving paths? Are they all
paths which will lead him, who acts according to them, into a state of
union with Brahmâ?

   'Just, Gotama, as near a village or a town there are many and various
paths{3}, yet they all meet together in the village--just in that way
are all the various paths taught by various Brahmans--the Addhariyâ
Brahmans, the Tittiriyâ Brahmans, the *Kh*andokâ Brahmans \[the
*Kh*andavâ Brahmans\], the Bavhari*g*â Brahmans. Are all these saving
paths? Are they all paths which will lead him, who acts according to
them, into a state of union with Brahmâ?'

   11. 'Do you say that they all lead aright, Vâse*tth*a?

   'I say so, Gotama.'

{1. This is either mildly sarcastic--as much as to say, 'that is six of
one, and half a dozen of the other'--or is intended to lead on
Vâse*tth*a to confess still more directly the fact that the different
theologians held inconsistent opinions.

2\. The MSS. differ as to the last name, and some of them omit the last
but one. The Adhvaryu, Taittîriya, *Kh*andoga, and Bahv*rik*a
priests--those skilled in liturgy generally, and in the Ya*g*ur, Sâma,
and Rig Vedas respectively--are probably meant. If we adopt the other
reading for the last in the list, then those priests who relied on
liturgy, sacrifice, or chant would be contrasted with those who had
'gone forth' as *religieux*, either as *Tâpasas* or as *Bhikshus*.

3\. Maggâni, which is noteworthy as a curious change of gender.}

<span id="p. 304">{p. 304}</span>

   'Do you really say that they all lead aright, Vâse*tth*a?'

   'So I say, Gotama.' <span id="text p. 238">\[238\]</span>

   12. 'But yet, Vâse*tth*a, is there a single one of the Brahmans
versed in the Three Vedas who has ever seen Brahmâ face to face?'

   'No, indeed, Gotama.'

   'Or is there then, Vâse*tth*a, a single one of the teachers of the
Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas who has seen Brahmâ face to face?'

   'No, indeed, Gotama!'

   'Or is there then, Vâse*tth*a, a single one of the teachers of the
teachers of the Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas who has seen Brahmâ
face to face?'

   'No, indeed, Gotama!'

   'Or is there then, Vâse*tth*a, a single one of the Brahmans up to the
seventh generation who has seen Brahmâ face to face?'

   'No, indeed, Gotama!'

   13. 'Well then, Vâse*tth*a, those ancient Rishis of the Brahmans
versed in the Three Vedas, the authors of the verses, the utterers of
the verses, whose ancient form of words so chanted, uttered, or
composed, the Brahmans of to-day chant over again or repeat; intoning or
reciting exactly as has been intoned or recited--to wit, A*tth*aka,
Vâmaka, Vâmadeva, Vessâmitta, Yamataggi, A<u>n</u>girasa, Bhâradvâ*g*a,
Vâsettha, Kassapa, and Bhagu{1}--did even they speak thus, saying: "We
know it, we have seen it, where Brahmâ is, whence Brahmâ is, whither
Brahmâ is?"'

   'Not so, Gotama!'

   14. 'Then you say, Vâse*tth*a, that none of the Brahmans, or of their
teachers, or of their pupils, <span id="text p. 239">\[239\]</span> even
up to the seventh generation, has ever seen Brahmâ face to face. And
that even the Rishis of old, the authors and utterers of the verses, of
the ancient form of words which the Brahmans of to-day so carefully
intone and recite precisely as they have

<span class="small">{1. See the note on these names at 'Vinaya Texts,'
II, 130.}</span>

<span id="p. 305">{p. 305}</span>

been handed down--even they did not pretend to know or to have seen
where or whence or whither Brahmâ is{1}. So that the Brahmans versed in
the Three Vedas have forsooth said thus: "What we know not, what we have
not seen, to a state of union with that we can show the way, and can
say: 'This is the straight path, this is the direct way which makes for
salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of
union with Brahmâ!'"

   'Now what think you, Vâse*tth*a? Does it not follow, this being so,
that the talk of the Brahmans, versed though they be in the Three Vedas,
turns out to be foolish talk?'

   'In sooth, Gotama, that being so, it follows that the talk of the
Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas is foolish talk!'

   15. 'Verily, Vâse*tth*a. that Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas
should be able to show the way to a state of union with that which they
do not know, neither have seen--such a condition of things can in no
wise be!

   'Just, Vâse*tth*a, as when a string of blind men are clinging one to
the other{2}, neither can the foremost see, nor can the middle one see,
nor can the hindmost see--just even so, methinks, Vâse*tth*a, is the
talk of the Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas but blind talk: the first
<span id="text p. 240">\[240\]</span> sees not, the middle one sees not,
nor can the latest see. The talk then of these

2\. Andhave*n*î parampara*m* sa*m*sattâ. The Phayre MS. has replaced
ve*n*î by pave*n*î, after the constant custom of the Burmese MSS. to
improve away unusual or difficult expressions. Buddhaghosa explains
andhave*n*i by andhapave*n*i; and tells a tale of a wicked wight, who
meeting a company of blind men, told them of a certain village wherein
plenty of good food was to be had. When they besought him for hire to
lead them there, he took the money, made one blind man catch hold of his
stick, the next of that one, and so on, and then led them on till they
came to a wilderness. There he deserted them, and they all--still
holding each the other, and vainly, and with tears, seeking both their
guide and the path--came to a miserable end! Comp. M. II, 170.}

words, a vain and empty thing!'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   16. 'Now what think you, Vâse*tth*a? Can the Brahmans versed in the
Three Vedas--like other, ordinary, folk--see the Moon and the Sun as
they pray to, and praise, and worship them, turning round with clasped
hands towards the place whence they rise and where they set?'

   'Certainly, Gotama, they can{1}.'

   17. 'Now what think you, Vâse*tth*a? The Brahmans versed in the Three
Vedas, who can very well--like other, ordinary, folk--see the Moon and
the Sun as they pray to, and praise, and worship them, turning round
with clasped hands to the place whence they rise and where they set--are
those Brahmans, versed in the Three Vedas, able to point out the way to
a state of union with the Moon or the Sun, saying: "This is the straight
path, this the direct way which makes for salvation, and leads him, who
acts according to it, to a state of union with the Moon or the Sun?"'

   'Certainly, not, Gotama!'

   18. 'So you say, Vâse*tth*a, that the Brahmans are not able to point
out the way to union with that which they have seen, and you further say
that neither any one of them, nor of their pupils, <span

seventh generation has ever seen Brahmâ. And you further say that even
the Rishis of old, whose words they hold in such deep respect, did not
pretend to know, or to have seen where, or whence, or whither Brahmâ is.

following answers. It must be remembered, for these sections, that the
Sun and Moon were gods just as much as Brahmâ; and that the Moon always
comes first in Nikâya and other ancient texts.

Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas is foolish talk!'

love the most beautiful woman in this land!"

   'And people should ask him, "Well! good friend! this most beautiful
woman in the land, whom you thus love and long for, do you know whether
that beautiful woman is a noble lady or a Brahman woman, or of the
trader class, or a *S*ûdra?"

   'But when so asked, he should answer: "No."

beautiful woman is, or what is her family name, whether she be tall or
short or of medium height, dark or brunette or golden in colour, or in
what village or town or city she dwells?"

so, that the talk of that man was foolish talk?'

that man was foolish talk!'

repetition. The comment is silent.

   'Forms perceptible to the eye; desirable, agreeable, pleasant,
attractive forms, that are accompanied by lust and cause delight. Sounds
of the same kind perceptible to the ear. Odours of the same kind
perceptible to the nose. Tastes of the same kind perceptible to the
tongue. Substances of the same kind perceptible to the body by touch.
These five things predisposing to passion are called, in the Discipline
of the Arahats, a "chain" and a "bond." And these five things
predisposing to lust, Vâse*tth*a, do the Brahmans versed in the Three
Vedas cling to, they are infatuated by them, attached to them, see not
the danger of them, know not how unreliable they are, and so enjoy
them{1}.'

   'The hindrance of worldly lusts,

   'The hindrance of illwill,

   'The hindrance of torpor and sloth of heart a mind,

   'The hindrance of flurry and worry,

   'The hindrance of suspense.

   'These are the Five Hindrances, Vâse*tth*a, which. in the Discipline
of the Arahats, are called veils, and are called hindrances, and are
called obstacles, and are called entanglements{2}.

   'Now with these Five Hindrances, Vâse*tth*a, the Brahmans versed in
the Three Vedas are veiled, hindered, obstructed, and entangled.

   'And verily, Vâse*tth*a, that Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas, but
omitting the practice of those qualities which really make a man a
Brahman, and adopting the practice of those qualities which really make
men non-Brahmans--veiled, hindered, obstructed, and entangled by these
Five Hindrances--that these Brahmans should after death, on the
dissolution of the body, <span id="text p. 247">\[247\]</span> become
united to Brahmâ--such a condition of things can in no wise be!'

   31. 'Now what think you, Vâse*tth*a, and what have you heard from the
Brahmans aged and well-stricken in years, when the learners and teachers
are talking

together? Is Brahmâ in possession of wives and wealth, or is he not{1}?'

   'He is not, Gotama.'

   'Is his mind full of anger, or free from anger?'

   'Free from anger, Gotama.'

   'Is his mind full of malice, or free from malice?'

   'Free from malice, Gotama.'

   'Is his mind tarnished, or is it pure{2}?'

   'It is pure, Gotama.'

   'Has he self-mastery, or has he not{3}?'

   'He has, Gotama.'

   32. 'Now what think you, Vâse*tth*a, are the Brahmans versed in the
Vedas in the possession of wives and wealth, or are they not?'

   'They are, Gotama.'

   'Have they anger in their hearts, or have they not?'

   'They have, Gotama.'

   'Do they bear malice, or do they not?'

   'They do, Gotama.'

   'Are they pure in heart, or are they not?'

   'They are not, Gotama.'

   'Have they self-mastery, or have they not?'

   'They have not, Gotama.'

   33. 'Then you say, Vâse*tth*a, that the Brahmans are in possession of
wives and wealth, and that Brahmâ is not. Can there, then, be agreement
and likeness between the Brahmans with their wives and property, and
Brahmâ, who has none of these things?'

{1. Sapariggaho vâ Brahmâ apariggaho vâ ti. Buddhaghosa says on
Vâse*tth*a's reply, 'Kâma*kkh*andassa âbhavato itthipariggahena
apariggaho,' thus restricting the 'possession' to women. But the
reference is no doubt to the first 'hindrance'; and the word in the
text, though doubtless alluding to possession of women also, includes
more. Compare, on the general idea of the passage, the English
expression, 'no encumbrances,' and Jacobi, '*G*aina-Sûtras' (S. B. E.)
I, xxiii.

2\. Asa<u>n</u>kili*tth*a-kitto. That is, says Buddhaghosa, 'free from
mental torpor and idleness, worry and flurry.'

3\. Vasavattî vâ avasavattî vâ. Buddhaghosa says, in explanation of the
answer, 'By the absence of wavering he has his mind under control (vase
vatteti).'}

<span id="p. 314">{p. 314}</span>

   'Certainly not, Gotama!'

   34. 'Very good, Vâse*tth*a. But, verily, that these Brahmans versed
in the Vedas, who live married and wealthy, should after death, when the
body is dissolved, <span id="text p. 248">\[248\]</span> become united
with Brahmâ who has none of these things--such a condition of things can
in no wise be!'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   35. 'Then you say, too, Vâse*tth*a, that the Brahmans bear anger and
malice in their hearts. and are tarnished in heart and uncontrolled,
whilst Brahmâ is free from anger and malice, pure in heart, and has
self-mastery. Now can there, then, be concord and likeness between the
Brahmans and Brahmâ?'

   'Certainly not, Gotama!'

   36. 'Very good, Vâse*tth*a. That these Brahmans versed in the Vedas
and yet bearing anger and malice in their hearts, sinful, and
uncontrolled, should after death, when the body is dissolved, become
united to Brahmâ, who is free from anger and malice, pure in heart, and
has self-mastery--such a condition of things can in no wise be!

   'So that thus then, Vâse*tth*a, the Brahmans, versed though they be
in the Three Vedas, while they sit down (in confidence), are sinking
down (in the mire){1}; and so sinking they are arriving only at despair,
thinking the while that they are crossing over into some happier land.

   'Therefore is it that the threefold wisdom of the Brahmans, wise in
their Three Vedas, is called a waterless desert, their threefold wisdom
is called a pathless jungle, their threefold wisdom is called
perdition!'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   37. 'When he had thus spoken, the young Brahman Vâse*tth*a said to
the Blessed One:

<span class="small">{1. Âsîditva sa*m*sîdanti. I have no doubt the
commentator is right in his explanation of these figurative expressions.
Confident in their knowledge of the Vedas, and in their practice of
Vedic ceremonies, they neglect higher things; and so, sinking into folly
and superstition, 'they are arriving only at despair, thinking the while
that they are crossing over into some happier land.'}</span>

<span id="p. 315">{p. 315}</span>

   'It has been told me, Gotama, that the Sama*n*a Gotama knows the way
to the state of union with Brahmâ.'

   'What do you think, Vâse*tth*a, is not Manasâka*t*a near to this
spot, not distant from this spot?'

   'Just so, Gotama, Manasâka*t*a is near to, is not far from here.'

   'Now what think you, Vâse*tth*a, suppose there were a man born in
Manasâka*t*a, and people should ask him, who never till that time had
left Manasâka*t*a, <span id="text p. 249">\[249\]</span> which was the
way to Manasâka*t*a. Would that man, born and brought up in
Manasâka*t*a, be in any doubt or difficulty?'

   'Certainly not, Gotama! And why? If the man had been born and brought
up in Manasâka*t*a, every road that leads to Manasâka*t*a would be
perfectly familiar to him.'

   38. 'That man, Vâse*tth*a, born and brought up at Manasâka*t*a might,
if he were asked the way to Manasâka*t*a, fall into doubt and
difficulty, but to the Tathâgata, when asked touching the path which
leads to the world of Brahmâ, there can be neither doubt nor difficulty.
For Brahmâ, I know, Vâse*tth*a, and the world of Brahmâ, and the path
which leadeth unto it. Yea, I know it even as one who has entered the
Brahmâ-world, and has been born within it!'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   39. When he had thus spoken, Vâse*tth*a, the young Brahman, said to
the Blessed One:

   'Just so has it been told me, Gotama, even that the Sama*n*a Gotama
knows the way to a state of union with Brahmâ. It is well! Let the
venerable Gotama be pleased to show us the way to a state of union with
Brahmâ, let the venerable Gotama save the Brahman race{1}!'

   'Listen then, Vâse*tth*a, and give ear attentively, and I will
speak!'

<span class="small">{1. Buddhaghosa takes this to mean, 'Save *me* of
the Brahman race.'}</span>

<span id="p. 316">{p. 316}</span>

   'So be it, Lord!' said the young Brahman Vâse*tth*a, in assent, to
the Blessed One.

   40. 'Then the Blessed One spake, and said: 'Know, Vâse*tth*a, that
(from time to time) a Tathâgata is born into the world, an Arahat, a
fully awakened one, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with
knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be
led, a teacher of gods and men, a Blessed One, a Buddha. He, by himself,
thoroughly understands, and sees, as it were, face to face this
universe--including the worlds above with the gods, the Mâras, and the
Brahmâs; and the world below with its Sama*n*as and Brahmans, its
princes and peoples;--and he then makes his knowledge known to others.
The truth doth he proclaim both in the letter and in the spirit, lovely
in its origin, lovely in its progress, lovely in its consummation: the
higher life doth he make known, in all its purity and in all its
perfectness.

   41. 'A householder (gahapati), or one of his children, or a man of
inferior birth in any class, listens to that truth{1}. On hearing the
truth he has faith in the Tathâgata, and when he has acquired that faith
he thus considers with himself:

   '"Full of hindrances is household life, a path defiled by passion:
free as the air is the life of him who has renounced all worldly things.
How difficult it is for the man who dwells at home to live the higher
life in all its fullness, in all its purity, in all its bright
perfection! Let me then cut off my hair and beard, let me clothe myself
in the orange-coloured robes, and let me go forth from a household life
into the homeless state!"

   'Then before long, forsaking his portion of wealth, be it great or be
it small; forsaking his circle of relatives, be they many or be they
few, he cuts off his hair and beard, he clothes himself in the
orange-coloured

robes, and he goes forth from the household life into the homeless
state.

   42. 'When he has thus become a recluse he passes a life
self-restrained by that restraint which should be binding on a recluse.
Uprightness is his delight, and he sees danger in the least of those
things he should avoid. He adopts and trains himself in the precepts. He
encompasses himself with goodness in word and deed. He sustains his life
by means that are quite pure; good is his conduct, guarded the door of
his senses; mindful and self-possessed, he is altogether happy!' <span
id="text p. 250">\[250\]</span>

   43-75. 'And how, Vâse*tth*a, is his conduct good?'

   \[The answer is set forth in the words of the tract on the Sîlas,
translated above, [pp. 3-26](dob-01tx.htm#text%20p.%204.md), but with the
refrain as in the Sâma*ññ*a-phala Suttanta above, [p.

63-75](dob-02tx.htm#text%20p.%2069.md), inclusive, of the Sâma*ññ*a-phala;
setting forth:--

   1. The confidence of heart that results from the sense of goodness.

   2. The way in which he guards the doors of his senses.

   3. The way in which he is mindful and self-possessed.

   4. His habit of being content with little, of adopting simplicity of
life.

   5. His conquest of the Five Hindrances, each with the explanatory
simile.

   6. The joy and peace which, as a result of this conquest, fills his
whole being.\]

a great part in later Buddhism, and occupy very much the place that
prayer takes in Christianity. A fifth, the meditation on Impurity, has
been added, at what time I do not know, before the last. These four (or
five) are called the Brahma Vihâras, and the practice of them leads, not
to Arahatship, but to rebirth in the Brahmâ-world.}</span>

whole wide world, above, below, around, and everywhere, does he continue
to pervade with heart of Love, far-reaching, grown great, and beyond
measure.

   77. 'Just, Vâse*tth*a, as a mighty trumpeter makes himself heard--and
that without difficulty--in all the four directions; even so of all
things that have shape or life, there is not one that he passes by or
leaves aside, but regards them all with mind set free, and deep-felt
love.

   'Verily this, Vâse*tth*a, is the way to a state of union with Brahmâ.

thoughts of pity{1}, . . . sympathy{1}, . . . equanimity{1}, and so the

be in possession of women and of wealth, or will he not?'

   'He will not, Gotama!'

   81. 'Then you say, Vâse*tth*a, that the Bhikkhu is free from
household and worldly cares, and that Brahmâ is free from household and
worldly cares. Is there then agreement and likeness between the Bhikkhu
and Brahmâ?'

   'There is, Gotama!'

   'Very good, Vâse*tth*a. Then in sooth, Vâse*tth*a, that the Bhikkhu
who is free from household cares should after death, when the body is
dissolved, become united with Brahmâ, who is the same-such a condition
of things is every way possible!

   'And so you say, Vâse*tth*a, that the Bhikkhu is free from anger, and
free from malice, pure in mind, and master of himself; and that Brahmâ
is free from anger, and free from malice. pure in mind, and master of
himself. Then in sooth, Vâse*tth*a, that the Bhikkhu who is free from

Bhâradvâ*g*a addressed the Blessed One, and said:

   'Most excellent, Lord, are the words of thy mouth, most excellent!
Just as if a man were to set up that which is thrown down, or were to
reveal that which is hidden away, or were to point out the right road to
him who has gone astray, or were to bring a lamp into the darkness, so
that those who have eyes can see external forms;--just even so, Lord,
has the truth been made known to us, in many a figure, by the Exalted
One. And we, even we, betake ourselves, Lord, to the Blessed One as our
guide, to the Truth,

true believers, from this day forth, as long as life endures!'
