### NOTE ON THE PROBABLE AGE OF THE DIALOGUES.

The Dialogues of the Buddha, constituting, in the Pâli ext, the Dîgha
and Ma*ggh*ima Nikâyas, contain a full exposition of what the early
Buddhists considered the teaching of the Buddha to have been.
Incidentally they contain a large number of references to the social,
political, and religious condition of India at the time when they were
put together. We do not know for certain what that time exactly was. But
every day is adding to the number of facts on which an approximate
estimate of the date may be based. And the ascertained facts are already
sufficient to give us a fair working hypothesis.

   In the first place the numerous details and comparative tables given
in the Introduction to my translation of the Milinda show without a
doubt that practically the whole of the Pâli Pi*t*akas were known, and
regarded as final authority, at the time and place when that work was
composed. The geographical details given on pp. xliii, xliv tend to show
that the work was composed in the extreme North-West of India. There are
two Chinese works, translations of Indian books taken to China from the
North of India, which contain, in different recensions, the introduction

<span id="p. x">{p. x}</span>

and the opening chapters of the Milinda{1}, For the reasons adduced
(*loco citato*) it is evident that the work must have been composed at
or about the time of the Christian era. Whether (as M. Sylvain Levy
thinks) it is an enlarged work built up on the foundation of the Indian
original of the Chinese books; or whether (as I am inclined to think)
that original is derived from our Milinda, there is still one conclusion
that must be drawn--the Nikâyas, nearly if not quite as we now ha ve
them in the Pâli, were *known at a very early date in the North of
India*.

   Then again, the Kathâ Vatthu (according to the views prevalent, at
the end of the fourth century A.D., at Kâ*ñk*ipura in South India, and
at Anurâdhapura in Ceylon; and recorded, therefore, in their
commentaries, by Dhammapâla and Buddhaghosa) was composed, in the form
in which we now have it, by Tissa, the son of Moggalî, in the middle of
the third century B.C., at the court of Asoka, at Pâ*t*aliputta, the
modern Patna, in the North of India,

   It is a recognised rule of evidence in the courts of law that, if an
entry be found in the books kept by a man in the ordinary course of his
trade, which entry speaks against himself, then that entry is especially
worthy of credence. Now at the time when they made this entry about
Tissa's authorship of the Kathâ Vatthu the commentators believed, and it
was an accepted tenet of those among whom they mixed--just as it was,
*mutatis mutandis*, among the theologians in Europe, at the
corresponding date in the history of *their* faith--that the whole of
the canon was the word of the Buddha. They also held that it had been
actually recited, at the Council of Râ*g*agaha, immediately after his
decease. It is, I venture to submit, absolutely impossible, under these
circumstances, that the commentators can have invented this information

<span class="small">{1. See the authors quoted in the Introduction to
vol. ii of my translation. Professor Takakusu, in an article in the J.
R. A. S. for 1896, has added important details.}</span>

<span id="p. xi">{p. xi}</span>

about Tissa and the Kathâ Vatthu. They found it in the records on which
their works are based. They dared not alter it. The best they could do
was to try to explain it away. And this they did by a story, evidently
legendary, attributing the first scheming out of the book to the Buddha.
But they felt compelled to hand on, as they found it, the record of
Tissa's authorship. And this deserves, on the ground that it is evidence
against themselves, to have great weight attached to it.

   The text of the Kathâ Vatthu now lies before us in a scholarly
edition, prepared for the Pâli Text Society by Mr. Arnold C. Taylor. It
purports to be a refutation by Tissa of 250 erroneous opinions held by
Buddhists belonging to schools of thought different from his own. We
have, from other sources, a considerable number of data as regards the
different schools of thought among Buddhists--often erroneously called
'the Eighteen Sects{1}.' We are beginning to know something about the
historical development of Buddhism, and to be familiar with what sort of
questions are likely to have arisen. We are beginning to know somethmg
of the growth of the language, of the different Pâli styles. In all
these respects the Kathâ Vatthu fits in with what we should expect as
possible, and probable, in the time of Asoka, and in the North of India.

   Now the discussions as carried on in the Kathâ Vatthu are for the
most part, and on both sides, an appeal to authority. And to what
authority? Without any exception as yet discovered, to the Pi*t*akas,
and as we now have them, in Pâli. Thus on p. 339 the appeal is to the
passage translated below, on p. 278, § 6; and it is quite evident that
the quotation is from our Suttanta, and not from any other passage where

<span class="small">{1. They are not 'sects' at all, in the modem
European sense of the word. Some of the more important of these data are
collected in two articles by the present writer in the 'Journal of the

There are many more quotations from the older Pi*t*aka books in the
Kathâ Vatthu, about three or four times as many as are contained in this
list. But this is enough to show that, *at the time when the Kathâ
Vatthu was composed, all the Five Nikâyas were extant; and were
considered to be final authorities to any question that was being
discussed*. They must themselves, therefore, be considerably older.

   Thirdly, Hofrath Bühler and Dr. Hultsch have called attention{1} to
the fact that in inscriptions of the third century B.C. we find, as
descriptions of donors to the dâgabas, the expressions dhammakathika,
pe*t*akî, suttantika, suttantakinî, and pa*ñk*a-nekâyika.

<span class="small">{1. 'Epigr. Ind.,' II, 93, and 'Z. D. M. G.,' xl, p.
58.}</span>

<span id="p. xiii">{p. xiii}</span>

The Dhamma, the Pi*t*akas, the Suttantas, and the five Nikâyas must have
existed for some time before the brethren and sisters could be described
as preachers of the Dhamma, as reciters of the Pi*t*aka, and as
guardians of the Suttantas or of the Nikâyas (which were not yet
written, and were only kept alive in the memory of living men and
women).

   Simple as they seem, the exact force of these technical designations
is not, as yet, determined. Dr. K. Neumann thinks that Pe*t*akî does not
mean 'knowing the Pi*t*akas,' but 'knowing the Pi*t*aka,' that is, the
Nikâyas--a single Pi*t*aka, in the sense of the Dhamma, having been
known before the expression 'the Pi*t*akas' came into use{1}. As he
points out, the title of the old work Pe*t*akopadesa, which is an
exposition, not of the three Pi*t*akas, but only of the Nikâyas,
supports his view. So again the Dialogues are the only parts or passages
of the canonical books called, in our MSS., suttantas. Was then a
suttantika one who knew precisely the Dialogues by heart? This was no
doubt the earliest use of the term. But it should be recollected that
the Kathâ Vatthu, of about the same date, uses the word suttanta also
for passages from other parts of the scriptures.

   However this may be, the terms *are conclusive proof of the
existence, some considerable time before the date of the inscriptions,
of a Buddhist literature called either a Pi*t*aka or the Pi*t*akas,
containing Suttantas, and divided into Five Nikâyas*.

   Fourthly, on Asoka's Bhabra Edict he recommends to the communities of
the brethren and sisters of the Order, and to the lay disciples of
either sex, frequently to hear and to meditate upon seven selected
passages. These are as follows:--

   1. Vinaya-samukka*m*sa.

   2. Ariya-vâsâni from the Dîgha (Sa*m*gîti Suttanta),

   3. Anâgata-bhayâni from the A<u>n</u>guttara III, 105-108.

   4. Muni-gâthâ from the Sutta Nipâta 206-220.

<span class="small">{1. 'Reden des Gotamo,' pp. x, xi.}</span>

<span id="p. xiv">{p. xiv}</span>

   5. Moneyya Sutta from the Iti Vuttaka 67 = A. I, 272.

   6. Upatissa-pasina.

   7. Râhulovâda = Râhulovâda Suttanta (M. I, 414-42O).

   Of these passages Nos. 1 and 6 have not yet been satisfactorily
identified. The others may be regarded as certain, for the reasons I
have set out elsewhere{1}. No. 2 also occurs in the tenth book of the
A<u>n</u>guttara. It is clear that in Asoka's time there was
acknowledged to be an authoritative literature, probably a collection of
books, containing what was then believed to be the words of the Buddha:
and that it comprised passages already known by the titles given in his
Edict. Five out of the seven having been found in the published portions
of what we now call the Pi*t*akas. and in the portion of them called the
Five Nikâyas, raises the presumption that when the now unpublished
portions are printed the other two will also, probably, be identified.
We have no evidence that any other Buddhist literature was in existence
at that date.

   What is perhaps still more important is the point to which M.
Senart{2} has called attention, and supported by numerous details:--the
very clear analogy between the general tone and the principal points of
the moral teaching, on the one hand of the Asoka edicts as a whole, and
on the other of the Dhammapada, an anthology of edifying verses taken,
in great part, from the Five Nikâyas. The particular verses selected by
M. Senart, as being especially characteristic of Asoka's ideas, include
extracts from each of the Five.

   Fifthly, the four great Nikâyas contain a number of stock passages,
which are constantly recurring, and in which some ethical state is set
out or described. Many of these are also found in the prose passages

{1. 'Journal of the Pâli Text Society,' 1896; 'Journal of the Royal
Asiatic Society,' 1898, p. 639. Compare 'Milinda' (S. B. E., vol. xxxv),
pp. xxxvii foll.

2\. 'Inscriptions de Piyadasi,' II, 314-322.}

<span id="p. xv">{p. xv}</span>

of the various books collected together in the Fifth, the Khuddaka
Nikâya. A number of them are found in each of the thirteen Suttantas
translated in this volume. There is great probability that such passages
already existed, as ethical sayings or teachings, not only before the
Nikâyas were put together, but even before the Suttantas were put
together.

   There are also entire episodes, containing not only ethical teaching,
but names of persons and places and accounts of events, which are found,
in identical terms, at two or more places. These should be distinguished
from the last. But they are also probably older than our existing texts.
Most of the parallel passages, found in both Pâli and Sanskrit Buddhist
texts, come under one or other of these two divisions.

   Sixthly, the Sa*m*yutta Nikâya (III, 13) quotes one Suttanta in the
Dialogues by name; and both the Sa*m*yutta and the A<u>n</u>guttara
Nikâyas quote, by name and chapter, certain poems now found only in a
particular chapter of the Sutta Nipâta. *This Suttanta, and these poems,
must therefore be older, and older in their present arrangement, than
the final settlement of the text of these two Nikâyas*.

   Seventhly, several of the Dialogues purport to relate conversations
that took place between people, cotemporaries with the Buddha, but
*after the Buddha's death*. One Sutta in the A<u>n</u>guttara is based
on the death of the wife of Mu*n*da, king of Magadha, who began to reign
about forty years after the death of the Buddha. There is no reason at
all to suspect an interpolation. It follows that, not only the Sutta
itself, but *the date of the compilation of the A<u>n</u>guttara, must
be subsequent to that event*.

   There is a story in Peta Vatthu IV, 3, 1 about a King Pingalaka.
Dhammapâla, in his commentary, informs us that this king, of whom
nothing is otherwise known, lived two hundred years after the Buddha. It
follows that this poem, and also the Peta Vatthu in which it is found,
and also the Vimâna Vatthu, with which the Peta Vatthu really forms one
whole work,

<span id="p. xvi">{p. xvi}</span>

are later than the date of Pingalaka. And there is no reason to believe
that the commentator's date, although it is evidently only a round
number, is very far wrong. These books are evidently, from their
contents, the very latest compositions in all the Five Nikâyas.

   There is also included among the Thera Gâthâ, another book in the
Fifth Nikâya, verses said, by Dhammapâla the commentator{1}, to have
been composed by a *thera* of the time of King Bindusâra, the father of
Asoka, and to have been added to the collection at the time of Asoka's
Council.

   Eighthly, several Sanskrit Buddhist texts have now been made
accessible to scholars. We know the real titles, given in the MSS.
themselves, of nearly 200 more{2}. And the catalogues in which the names
occur give us a considerable amount of detailed information as to their
contents. No one of them is a translation, or even a recension, of any
one of the twenty-seven canonical books. They are independent works; and
seem to bear to the canonical books a relation similar, in many
respects, to that borne by the works of the Christian Fathers to the
Bible. But though they do not reproduce any complete texts, they contain
numerous verses, some whole poems, numerous sentences in prose, and some
complete episodes, found in the Pâli books. And about half a dozen
instances have been already found in which such passages are stated, or
inferred, to be from older texts, and are quoted as authorities. Most
fortunately we may hope, owing to the enlightened liberality of the
Academy of St. Petersburg, and the zeal and scholarship of Professor
d'Oldenbourg and his co-workers, to have a considerable number of
Buddhist Sanskrit Texts in the near future. And this is just what, in
the present state of our knowledge of the history of Buddhist writings,
is so great a *desideratum*.

{1. Quoted by Prof. Oldenberg at p. 46 of his edition.

2\. Miss C. Hughes is preparing a complete alphabetical list of all
these works for the 'Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,' 1899.}

<span id="p. xvii">{p. xvii}</span>

   It is possible to construct, in accordance with these facts, a
working hypothesis as to the history of the literature. It is also
possible to object that the evidence drawn from the Milinda may be
disregarded on the ground that there is nothing to show that that work,
excepting only the elaborate and stately introduction and a few of the
opening chapters, is not an impudent forgery, and a late one, concocted
by some Buddhist in Ceylon. So the evidence drawn from the Kathâ Vatthu
may be disregarded on the ground that there is nothing to show that that
work is not an impudent forgery, and a late one, concocted by some
Buddhist in Ceylon. The evidence drawn from the inscriptions may be put
aside on the ground that they do not explicitly state that the Suttantas
and Nikâyas to which they refer, and the passages they mention, are the
same as those we now have. And the fact that the commentators point out,
as peculiar, that certain passages are nearly as late, and one whole
book quite as late, as Asoka, is no proof that the rest are older. It
may even be maintained that the Pâli Pi*t*akas are not therefore Indian
books at all: that they are all Ceylon forgeries, and should be rightly
called 'the Southern Recension' or 'the Si*m*halese Canon.'

   Each of these propositions, taken by itself, has the appearance of
careful scruple. And a healthy and reasonable scepticism is a valuable
aid to historical criticism. But can that be said of a scepticism that
involves belief in things far more incredible than those it rejects? In
one breath we are reminded of the scholastic dulness, the sectarian
narrowness, the literary incapacity, even the senile imbecility of the
Ceylon Buddhists. In the next we are asked to accept propositions
implying that they were capable of forging extensive documents so well,
with such historical accuracy, with so delicate a discrimination between
ideas current among themselves and those held centuries before, with so
great a literary skill in expressing the ancient views, that not only
did

<span id="p. xviii">{p. xviii}</span>

they deceive their contemporaries and opponents, but European scholars
have not been able to point out a single discrepancy in their work{1}.
It is not unreasonable to hesitate in adopting a scepticism which
involves belief in so unique, and therefore so incredible, a
performance.

   The hesitation will seem the more reasonable if we consider that to
accept this literature for what it purports to be--that is, as North
Indian{2}, and for the most part pre-Asokan--not only involves no such
absurdity, but is really just what one would *a priori* expect, just
what the history of similar literatures elsewhere would lead one to
suppose likely.

   The Buddha, like other Indian teachers of his time, taught by
conversation. A highly educated man (according to the education current
at the time), speaking constantly to men of similar education, he
followed the literary habit of his time by embodying his doctrines in
set phrases, sûtras, on which he enlarged on different occasions in
different ways. In the absence of books--for though writing was widely
known, the lack of writing materials made any lengthy written books
impossible{3}--such sûtras were the recognised form of preserving and
communicating opinion. These particular ones were not in Sanskrit, but
in the ordinary conversational idiom of the day, that is to say, in a
sort of Pâli.

{1. As is well known, the single instance of such a discrepancy, which
Prof. Minayeff made so much of, is a mare's nest. The blunder is on the
part of the European professor, not of the Ceylon pandits. No critical
scholar will accept the proposition that because the commentary on the
Kathâ Vatthu mentions the Vetulyakâ, therefore the Kathâ Vatthu itself
must be later than the rise of that school.

2\. North Indian, that is, from the modern European point of view. In
the books themselves the reference is to the *Middle Country*
(Ma*ggh*ima Desa). To them the country to the south of the Vindhyas
simply did not come into the calculation. How suggestive this is as to
the real place of origin of these documents!

3\. Very probably memoranda were used. But the earliest records of any
extent were the Asoka Edicts, and they had to be written on stone.}

<span id="p. xix">{p. xix}</span>

   When the Buddha died these sayings were collected together by his
disciples into the Four Great Nikâyas. They cannot have reached their
final form till about fifty years afterwards. Other sayings and verses,
most of them ascribed not to the Buddha himself, but to the disciples,
were put into a supplementary Nikâya. We know of slight additions made
to this Nikâya as late as the time of Asoka. And the developed doctrine
found in certain short books in it--notably in the Buddhava*m*sa and
Kariyâ Pi*t*aka. and in the Peta- and Vimâna-Vatthus--show that these
are later than the four old Nikâyas.

   For a generation or two the books as originally put together were
handed down by memory. And they were doubtless accompanied from the
first, as they were being taught, by a running commentary. About 100
years after the Buddha's death there was a schism in the community. Each
of the two schools kept an arrangement of the canon--still in Pâli (or
possibly spme allied dialect). Sanskrit was not used for any Buddhist
works till long afterwards, and never used at all, so far as we know,
for the canonical books. Each of these two schools broke up, in the
following centuries, into others; and several of them had their
different arrangements of the canonical books, differing also no doubt
in minor details. Even as late as the first century after the Christian
Era, at the Council of Kanishka, these books, among many others then
extant, remained the only authorities{1}. But they all, except only our
present Pâli Nikâyas, have been lost in India. Of the stock passages of
ethical statement, and of early episodes, used in the composition of
them, and of the Suttas now extant, numerous fragments have been
preserved in the Hînayâna Sanskrit texts. And some of the Suttas, and of
the separate books, as used in other schools, are represented in Chinese
translations of the fourth and

<span class="small">{1. On the often repeated error that a Sanskrit
canon was established at Kanishka's Council, see my 'Milinda,' vol. ii,
pp. xv, xvi.}</span>

<span id="p. xx">{p. xx}</span>

fifth centuries A.D. A careful and detailed comparison of these remains
with the Pâli Nikâyas, after the method adopted in Windisch's 'Mâra und
Buddha,' cannot fail to throw much light on the history, and on the
method of composition, of the canonical books, which in style and
method, in language and contents and tone, bear all the marks of so
considerable an antiquity.

   Hofrath Dr. Bühler, in the last work he published, expressed the
opinion that these books, as we have them in the Pâli, are good
evidence, certainly for the fifth, probably for the sixth, century B.C.
Subject to what has been said above, that will probably become, more and
more, the accepted opinion. And it is this which gives to all they tell
us, either directly or by implication, of the social, political, and
religious life of India, so great a value{1}.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   It is necessary, in spite of the limitations of our space, to add a
few words on the method followed in this version. We talk of Pâli
*books*. They are not books in the modern sense. They are memorial
sentences intended to be learnt by heart; and the whole style, and
method of arrangement is entirely subordinated to this primary
necessity. The leading ideas in any one of our Suttantas, for instance,
are expressed in short phrases not intended to convey to a European
reader the argument underlying them. These are often repeated with
slight variations. But neither the repetitions nor the
variations--introduced, and necessarily introduced, as aids to
memory--help the modern reader very much. That of course was not their
object. For the object they were intended

<span class="small">{1. No reference has been made, in these slight and
imperfect remarks, to the history of the Vinaya. There is nothing to
add, on that point, to the able and lucid exposition of Prof. Oldenberg
in the Introduction to his edition of the text.}</span>

<span id="p. xxi">{p. xxi}</span>

to serve they are singularly well chosen, and aptly introduced.

   Other expedients were adopted with a similar aim. Ideas were
formulated, not in logically co-ordinated sentences, but in numbered
groups; and lists were drawn up such as those found in the tract called
the Sîlas, and in the passage on the rejected forms of asceticism, both
translated below. These groups and lists, again, must have been
accompanied from the first by a running verbal commentary, given, in his
own words, by the teacher to his pupils. Without such a comment they are
often quite unintelligible, and always difficult.

   The inclusion of such *memoria technica* makes the Four Nikâyas
strikingly different from modern treatises on ethics or psychology. As
they stand they were never intended to be read. And a version in
English, repeating all the repetitions, rendering each item in the lists
and groups as they stand, by a single English word, without commentary,
would quite fail to convey the meaning, often intrinsically interesting,
always historically valuable, of these curious old documents.

   It is no doubt partly the result of the burden of such *memoria
technica*, but partly also owing to the methods of exposition then
current in North India, that the leading theses of each Suttanta are not
worked out in the way in which we should expect to find similar theses
worked out now in Europe. A proposition or two or three, are put
forward, re-stated with slight additions or variations, and placed as it
were in contrast with the contrary proposition (often at first put
forward by the interlocutor). There the matter is usually left. There is
no elaborate logical argument. The choice is offered to the hearer; and,
of course, he usually accepts the proposition as maintained by the
Buddha. The statement of this is often so curt, enigmatic, and
even--owing not seldom simply to our ignorance, as yet, of the exact
force of the technical terms used--so

<span id="p. xxii">{p. xxii}</span>

ambiguous, that a knowletige of the state of opinion on the particular
point, in North India, at the time, or a comparison of other Nikâya
passages on the subject, is necessary to remove the uncertainty.

   It would seem therefore most desirable that a scholar attempting to
render these Suttantas into a European language--evolved in the process
of expressing a very different, and often contradictory, set of
conceptions--should give the reasons of the faith that is in him. He
should state why he holds such and such an expression to be the least
inappropriate rendering: and quote parallel passages from other Nikâya
texts in support of his reasons. He should explain the real significance
of the thesis put forward by a statement of what, in his opinion, was
the point of view from which it was put forward, the stage of opinion
into which it fits, the current views it supports or controverts. In
regard to technical terms, for which there can be no exact equivalent,
he should give the Pâli. And in regard to the mnemonic lists and groups,
each word in which is usually a *crux*, he should give cross-references,
and wherever he ventures to differ from tht Buddhist explanations, as
handed down in the schools, should state the fact, and give his reasons.
It is only by such discussions that we can hope to make progress in the
interpretation of the history of Buddhist and Indian thought. Bare
versions are of no use to scholars, and even to the general reader they
can only convey loose, inadequate, and inaccurate ideas.

   These considerations will, I trust, meet with the approval of my
fellow workers. Each scholar would of course, in considering the
limitations of his space, make a different choice as to the points he
regarded most pressing to dwell upon in his commentary, as to the points
he would leave to explain themselves. It may, I am afraid, be considered
that my choice in these respects has not been happy, and especially that
too many words or phrases have been left without comment, where reasons
were necessary. But I have

<span id="p. xxiii">{p. xxiii}</span>

endeavoured, in the notes and introductions, to emphasise those points
on which further elucidation is desirable; and to raise some of the most
important of those historical questions which will have to be settled
before these Suttantas can finally be considered as having been rightly
understood.
