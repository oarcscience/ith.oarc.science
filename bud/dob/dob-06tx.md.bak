## VI. MAHÂLI SUTTA.

### \[THE AIM OF THE BRETHREN.\]

   <span id="text p. 150">\[150\]</span> 1. Thus have I heard. The
Blessed One was once staying at Vesâlî at the Gabled Hall in the Great
Wood{1}. Now at that time a number of Brahmans, who had been sent on
pressing business of one kind or another from Kosali and Magadhâ, were
lodging at Vesâlî.

   And they heard the news: 'They say that the Sama*n*a Gotama of the
Sâkya clan, who went out from a Sâkya family to adopt the religious
life, is now staying at Vesâlî at the Gabled Hall in the Great Wood. Now
regarding that venerable Gotama, such is the high reputation that has
been noised abroad: "That Blessed One is an Arahat, a fully awakened
one, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, who knows all worlds,
unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a teacher for gods
and men, a Blessed One, a Buddha. He, by himself, thoroughly knows and
sees, as it were, face to face this universe,--including the worlds
above of the gods, the Brahmâs, and the Mâras, and the world below with
its recluses and Brahmans, its princes and peoples,--and having known
it, he makes his knowledge known to others. The truth, lovely in its
origin, lovely in its progress, lovely in its

<span class="small">{1. The Great Wood stretched from Vesâlî northwards
to the Himâlaya range. In it they had laid out a pleasaunce for the
Order, and made there a storied house, with a hall below surrounded by
pillars only, and facing the west, and above it the gabled apartments in
which the Buddha so often stayed.}</span>

<span id="p. 198">{p. 198}</span>

consummation, doth he proclaim, both in the spirit and in the letter,
the higher life doth he make known, in all its fullness and in all its
purity. And good is it to pay visits to Arahats like that."'

   2. So those Brahmans from Kosala and Magadhâ went out to the Great
Wood, and to the Gabled Hall. Now at that time the venerable Nâgita was
acting as the personal attendant on the Blessed One. And they went to
him, and said: 'Where is it, Nâgita, that that venerable Gotama is
lodging now, for we wish to see him.

   <span id="text p. 151">\[151\]</span> 'It is not a fitting time,
Sirs, to call upon the Blessed One. He has retired into solitude.'

   Then they sat down round about, saying, 'We will not go away without
seeing the venerable Gotama.'

   3. And Hare-lip the Li*kkh*avi, too, came to the Great Wood, and to
the Gabled Hall, with a retinue of his clan; and going up to the
venerable Nâgita, he saluted him, and reverently standing apart, he said
to him: 'Where, venerable Nâgita, is the Blessed One now lodging, the
Arahat, the Buddha; for we wish to see him?' And on receiving a similar
reply he, too, sat down apart, saying: 'I will not go till I have seen
the August One, the Arahat, the Buddha.'

   4. But Sîha, a novice{1}, came up to the venerable Nâgita, and
saluted him, and standing reverently apart, he said to him: 'These
envoys of the Brahmans from Kosalâ and Magadhâ, many of them, have come,
O Kassapa{2}, to call upon the Blessed One; and Hare-lip the Li*kkh*avi,
too, with a retinue of his clan, has come to do the same. 'Twere best, O
Kassapa, that all this folk should be allowed to see the Blessed One.'

{1. He was the son of Nâgita's sister. He had joined the Order as a
novice when only seven years old, and shown so much intelligence as a
learner that he was a favourite with all, even with the Buddha himself.
He must therefore be different from the other Sîha, also a Li*kkh*avi,
who is the hero of the story told at Vin. I, 233-238 = A. IV, 179-188,
as the latter is not a member of the Order at all. Professor Edward
Müller (J. P. T. S., 1888, p. 97) confounds the two.

2\. This is the gotta, the *gens*, to which Nâgita belonged.}

<span id="p. 199">{p. 199}</span>

   'Very well, then, Sîha. Tell the Blessed One yourself.'

   'Very good, Sir,' said Sîha the novice in assent to the venerable
Nâgita. And he went where the Blessed One was, and saluted him, and
standing reverently apart, he said to him even as he had said to Nâgita.

   <span id="text p. 152">\[152\]</span> 'Very well, Sîha. Spread out a
mat for me in the shade in front of the house.'

   5. And Sîha did so. And the Blessed One came out from the house, and
sat down. And the Brahmans from Kosalâ and Magadhâ exchanged with him
the greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy, and took their
seats on one side. And Hare-lip the Li*kkh*avi also, with the retinue of
his clan, bowed down to the Blessed One, and seated himself on one side.
And when he was thus seated he addressed the Blessed One, and said:

   'Some few days ago, Sir, Sunakkhatta of the Li*kkh*avis{1} came to
me, and said: "It is only three years, Mahâli{2}, since I first came
under the Blessed One, and I can see heavenly forms, pleasant to behold,
fitted to satisfy all one's desires, exciting longing in one's heart.
But I cannot hear heavenly sounds like that." Now, Sir, are there such
heavenly sounds, which he could not hear, or have they no existence?'

   'They are real, those heavenly sounds, pleasant, fitted to satisfy
one's desires, exciting longing in one's heart, which he could not hear.
They are not things of nought.'

{1. This young man became the Buddha's personal attendant; but
afterwards, when the Buddha was in extreme old age (M. I, 68), he went
over to the creed of Kora the Kshatriya, and left the Buddhist Order.
Kora's doctrine was the efficacy of asceticism, of rigid
self-mortification. And it was to show how wrong this doctrine, as put
forth by Sunakkhatta, was, that the Buddha told the story (*G*ât. I,
398) of the uselessness of the efforts he himself had made when

</table>

But we do not hear that Sunakkhatta ever came back to the fold.

2\. This is again the name of the gotta, the *gens*. Buddhaghosa (p.
316) calls him a râ*g*a.}

<span id="p. 200">{p. 200}</span>

   6. 'But what then is the proximate, and what the ultimate cause, why
he could not hear them, they being thus real and not things of nought?'

   <span id="text p. 153">\[153\]</span> 7. 'Suppose a recluse, Mahâli,
to have practised one-sided concentration of mind with the object of
seeing such heavenly forms in any one direction,--in the East, or the
South, or the West, or the North, or above; or below, or across,--and
not with the object of hearing such heavenly sounds. Then since he has
practised one-sided concentration, with the one object only in view, he
only sees the sights, he hears not the sounds. And why not? Because of
the nature of his self-concentration \[samâdhi\].

   <span id="text p. 154">\[154\]</span> 8, 9. 'And so also, Mahâli, if
he have practised one-sided concentration with the object of hearing, in
any one direction, the heavenly sounds. Then, and for the same reason,
he hears the sounds, but he sees not the sights.

   <span id="text p. 155">\[155\]</span> 10, 11. 'But suppose, Mahâli,
he has practised self-concentration with the double object in view of
seeing and hearing, in any one direction, those heavenly sights and
those heavenly sounds. Then since he has practised self-concentration
with the double object in view, he both sees the sights and hears the
sounds. And why so? Because of the nature of his self-concentration.'

   12. 'Then, Sir, is it for the sake of attaining to the practice of
such self-concentration that the brethren lead the religious life under
the Blessed One?'

   'No, Mahâli. There are things, higher and sweeter than that, for the
sake of which they do so.'

   <span id="text p. 156">\[156\]</span> 13. 'And what, Sir, may those
other things be?'

   'In the first place, Mahâli, a brother by the complete destruction of
the Three Bonds (the Delusions of self, Doubt, and Trust in the efficacy
of good works and ceremonies){1} becomes a converted man, one who cannot
be reborn in any state of woe, and is assured of

<span class="small">{1. See my 'American Lectures' (London, 1896, pp.
142-149) for the full meaning of these three, and of the following
Bonds.}</span>

<span id="p. 201">{p. 201}</span>

attaining to the Insight (of the stages higher still){1}. That, Mahâli,
is a condition, higher and sweeter, for the sake of which the brethren
lead the religious life under me.

   'And then further, Mahâli, a brother by the complete destruction of
those Three Bonds, and by reducing to a minimum lust, illwill, and
dullness, becomes a Once-returner, one who on his first return to this
world shall make an end of pain. That, Mahâli, is a condition higher
still and sweeter, for the sake of which the brethren lead the religious
life under me.

   'And then further, Mahâli, a brother by the complete destruction of
the Five Bonds that bind people to this world{2} becomes an inheritor of
the highest heavens{3}, there to pass away, thence never to return{4}.
That, Mahâli, is a condition higher still and sweeter, for the sake of
which the brethren lead the religious life under me.

   'And then further. Mahâli, when a brother by the destruction of the
Deadly Floods (or Intoxications--Lusts, Becomings, Delusion, and
Ignorance) has, by himself, known and realised and continues to abide
here, in this visible world, in that emancipation of mind, that
emancipation of heart, which is Arahatship--that, Mahâli, is a condition
higher still and sweeter still, for the sake of which the brethren lead
the religious life under me.

   'Such, Mahâli, are the conditions higher and sweeter

{1. Sambodhi-parâyano. So Buddhaghosa on this (p. 313) and my
Introduction to this Sutta.

2\. The above three, and Sensuality and Illwill.

3\. Opapâtiko, literally 'accidental'; but the use of such a word would
only mislead the reader, the real connotation of the word being that of
the words I have chosen. Those who gain the highest heavens are so
called because there is no birth there in the ordinary way. Each being,
who is there, has appeared there suddenly, accidentally as it were,
without generation, conception, gestation or any of the other means
attending the birth of beings in the world.

4\. It is impossible to ignore a reference here to the view expressed in
the B*ri*had Âra*n*yaka Upanishad (VI, 2, 15). 'There do they dwell far
away, beyond, in the Brahmâ-worlds. And for them there is no return.'}

<span id="p. 202">{p. 202}</span>

(than seeing heavenly sights and hearing heavenly sounds), for the sake
of which the brethren lead the religious life under me.'

   14. 'But is there, Sir, a path, is there a method, for the
realisation of these conditions?'

   'Yes, Mahâli, there is.'

   <span id="text p. 157">\[157\]</span> 'And what, Sir, may be that
path, what that method?'

   'Verily it is this Noble Eightfold Path, that is to say: Right views,
right aspirations, right speech, right action, a right means of
livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right ecstasy in
self-concentration{1}. This, Mahâli, is the path, and this the method,
for the realisation of these conditions.

   15. 'One day, Mahâli, I was staying at Kosambî, in the Ghosita
pleasaunce. There two recluses, Ma*nd*issa the wandering mendicant, and
*G*âliya the pupil of Dârupattika (the man with the wooden bowl), came
to me, and exchanged with me the greetings and compliments of politeness
and courtesy, and stood reverently apart. And so standing they said to
me:

   'How is it then, O venerable Gotama, is the soul the same thing as
the body? Or is the soul one thing and the body another?'

   'Listen then, Sirs, and give heed attentively, and I will speak.'

   'Very good. Sir: said those two mendicants in assent, and I spake as
follows:--

   \[*Here follows the whole of the exposition given in the
Sâmañña-Phala Sutta,* [§§ 40-75](dob-02tx.htm#p.%2078.md)*, that is to
say:*

   1. *The appearance of a Buddha and his preaching.*

   2. *The awakening of a hearer, and his entry into the Order.*

   3. *His self-training in act, word, and speech.*

   4. *The minor details of morality which he observes.*

   5. *The absence of fear, confidence of heart thence resulting.*

<span class="small">{1. See my' American Lectures,' pp. 136-141; and
Sum. I, 314-316.}</span>

<span id="p. 203">{p. 203}</span>

   6. *The way in which he learns to guard the door of his senses.*

   7. *The Constant self-possession he thus gains.*

   8. *The power of being content with little, with simplicily of life.*

   9, *The emancipation of heart from the five hindrances--covelousness,
illwill, sloth of body and mind, excitement and worry, and perplexity.*

   10. *The resulting joy and peace that he gains.*\]

   16. 'Then estranged from lusts, aloof from evil states, he enters
into and remains in the First Rapture--a state of joy and ease, born of
detachment, reasoning and investigation going on the while. Now, Sirs,
when a Bhikshu knows thus and sees thus, would that make him ready to
take up the subject: "Is the soul the same thing as the body, or is the
soul one thing and the body another?"'

   'Yes, it would, Sir{1}.'

   'But I, Sirs, know thus and see thus, And nevertheless I do not say
either the one or the other,'

   <span id="text p. 158">\[158\]</span> 17, 18. \[*The cases are then
put of a Bhikshu who has acquired the second, third, and fourth
Raptures* (D. II, 77-81) *and the knowledge arising from insight*
(*Ñ*â*n*a-dassana; D. II, 83, 84); *and the same question, reply, and
rejoinder are given in each case.*\]

   19, 'With his heart thus serene (&c. above, p, 85), he directs and
bends down his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the Deadly
Floods, He knows as it really is: "This is pain." He knows as it really
is: "This is the origin of pain." He knows as it really is: "This is the
cessation of pain." He knows as it really is: "This is the Path that
leads to the cessation of pain." He knows as they really are: "These are
the Deadly Floods." He knows as it really is: "This is the origin of the
Deadly Floods." He knows as it really is: "This is the cessation of the
Deadly Floods." He knows as it really is: "This is the

Sir.' On the idiom kalla*m* eta*m* va*k*anâya compare A. I, 144; M. II,

<span id="p. 204">{p. 204}</span>

Path that leads to the cessation of the Deadly Floods." To him, thus
knowing, thus seeing, the heart is set free from the Deadly Taint of
Lusts, is set free from the Deadly Taint of Becomings, is set free from
the Deadly Taint of Ignorance. In him, thus set free, there arises the
knowledge of his emancipation, and he knows: "Rebirth has been
destroyed. The higher life has been fulfilled. What had to be done has
been accomplished. After this present life there will be no beyond!"

   'When a Bhikshu, Sirs, knows thus and sees thus, would that make him
ready to take up the question: "Is the soul the same as the body, or is
the soul one thing and the body another?"'

   'No, Sir, it would not{1}.'

   'And I, Sirs, know thus and see thus. And nevertheless I do not say
either the one or the other.'

   Thus spake the Blessed One; and Hare-lip the Li*kkh*avi, pleased at
heart, exalted the word of the Blessed One.

Here ends the Mahâli Sutta.

{1. So three Sinhalese and two Burmese MSS. and the Siamese edition. Two
Sinhalese MSS. read: 'Yes, Sir, it would.' But Buddhaghosa had clearly,
both here and above, § 16, the reading we have followed. And he gives a
characteristic explanation--that whereas the Arahat (in § 19) would have
too much wisdom to be led astray, following the false trail of the soul
theory, the Bhikshu who had only reached up to the *Gh*ânas might, being
still a puthu*gg*ana, an unconverted man, have leanings that way.

To hold that the soul *is* the same as the body is the heresy referred
to in the Brahma-*g*âla (above, [p. 46](dob-01tx.htm#p.%2046).md). See also
the Introduction to the Kû*t*adanta (above, [p.
167](dob-05in.htm#p.%20167).md).}
