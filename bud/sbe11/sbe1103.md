## INTRODUCTION

###### TO THE

## BOOK OF THE GREAT DECEASE.

IN translating this Sutta I have followed the text published by my
friend the late Mr. Childers, first in the journal of the Royal Asiatic
Society, and afterwards separately. In the former the text appeared in
two instalments, the first two sheets, with many various readings in the
footnotes, in the volume for 1874; and the remainder, with much fewer
various readings, in the volume for 1876. The reprinted text omits most
of the various readings in the first two sheets, and differs therefore
slightly in the paging. The letters D, S, Y, and Z, mentioned in the
notes, refer to MSS. sent to Mr. Childers from Ceylon by myself, Subhûti
Unnânse, Yâtramulle Unnânse, and Mudliar de Zoysa respectively. The MS.
mentioned as P (in the first two sheets quoted only in the separate
edition) is, no doubt, the Dîgha Nikâya MS. of the Phayre collection in
the India Office Library. The other four are now I believe in the
British Museum.

The Hon. George Turnour of the Ceylon Civil Service published an
analysis of this work in the journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society for
1839; but as he unfortunately skips, or only summarises, most of the
difficult passages, his work, though a most valuable contribution for
the time, now more than half a century ago, has not been of much service
for the present purpose. Of much greater value was Buddhaghosa's
commentary contained in the Suma<u>n</u>gala Vilâsinî\[1\]; but the
great fifth-century commentator

\[1. I have used the copy made for Turnour, and now in the India Office
Collection.\]

<span id="page_xxxii">p. xxxii</span>

wrote of course for Buddhists, and not for foreign scholars; and his
edifying notes and long exegetical expansions of the text (quite in the
style of Matthew Henry) often fail to throw light on the very points
which are most interesting, and most doubtful, to European readers.

The Mâlâla<u>n</u>kâra-vatthu, a late Pâli work by a Burmese author of
the eighteenth century\[1\], is based, in that part of it relating to
the last days of the Buddha, almost exclusively on the Book of the Great
Decease, and on Buddhaghosa's commentary upon it. Bishop Bigandet's
translation into English of a Burmese translation of this work, well
known under the title of 'The Life or Legend of Gaudama the Budha of the
Burmese,' affords evidence therefore of the traditional explanations of
the text. In the course either of the original author's recasting, or of
the double translation, so many changes have taken place, that its
evidence is frequently ambiguous and not always quite trustworthy: but
with due caution, it may be used as a second commentary.

------------------------

The exact meaning which was originally intended by the title of the book
is open to doubt. 'Great-Decease-Book' may as well mean 'the Great Book
of the Decease,' as 'the Book of the Great Decease.' This book is in
fact longer than any other in the collection, and the epithet 'Great' is
often opposed in titles to a 'Short' Sutta of (otherwise) the same
name\[2\]. But the epithet is also frequently intended, without doubt,
to qualify the immediately succeeding word in the title\[3\]; and,
though the phrase 'Great Decease,' as applied to the death of the
Buddha, has not been found elsewhere, it is, I think, meant to do so
here '.

\[1. See 'The Life or Legend,' &c., third edition, vol. ii. p. 149. The
date there given (1134 of the Burmese era = 1773 A.D.) is evidently the
date of the original work, and not of the translation. Nothing is said
in the book itself or in Bishop Bigandet's notes of the name of the
author, or of the name or date of the Burmese translator.

2\. There are several such pairs in the Ma*ggh*imâ Nikâya; and the
Mahâ-Satippai*tth*âna-Sutta in the Dîgha is the same as the
Satipa*tth*âna-Sutta in the Ma*ggh*ima.

3\. E.g. in the Mahâ-padhâna-Sutta and Mahâ-sudassana-Sutta.

4\. Childers seems to have been of the same opinion, vide Dict. I,
268.\]

<span id="page_xxxiii">p. xxxiii</span>

The division of the Book into chapters, or rather Portions for
Recitation, is found in the MSS.; the division of these chapters into
sections has been made by myself. It will be noticed that a very large
number of the sections have already been traced, chiefly by Dr. Morris
and myself, in various other parts of the Pâli Pi*t*akas: whole
paragraphs or episodes, quite independent of the repetitions and stock
phrases above referred to, recurring in two or more places. The question
then arises whether (1) the Book of the Great Decease is the borrower,
whether (2) it is the original source, or whether (3) these passages
were taken over, both into it, and into the other places where they
recur, from earlier sources. It will readily be understood that, in the
present state of our knowledge, or rather ignorance, of the Pâli
Pi*t*akas, this question cannot as yet be answered with any certainty.
But a few observations may even now be made.

Generally speaking the third of the above possible explanations is not
only more probable in itself, but is confirmed by parallel instances in
literatures developed under similar conditions, both in the valley of
the Ganges and in the basin of the Mediterranean.

It is quite possible that while some books--such as the Mahâ-vagga, the
*K*ulla-vagga, and the Dîgha Nikâya-usually owe their resemblances to
older sources now lost or absorbed; others--such as the Sa*m*yutta and
the A<u>n</u>guttara--are always in such cases simply borrowers from
sources still existing.

At the time when our Book of the Great Decease was put into its present
shape, and still more so when a Book of the Great Decease was first
drawn up, there may well have been some reliable tradition as to the
events that took place, and as to the subjects of his various
discourses, on the Buddha's last journey. He had then been a public
Teacher for forty-five years; and his system of doctrine, which is
really, on the whole, a very simple one, had already been long ago
elaborated, and applied in numerous discourses to almost every
conceivable variety of circumstances. What he then said would most
naturally be, as it is represented to have been, a final recapitulation
of the most

<span id="page_xxxiv">p. xxxiv</span>

important and characteristic tenets of his religion. But these are, of
course, precisely those subjects which are most fully and most
frequently dealt with in other parts of the Pâli Pi*t*akas. No record of
his actual words could have been preserved. It is quite evident that the
speeches placed in the Teacher's mouth, though formulated in the first
person, in direct narrative, are only intended to be summaries, and very
short summaries, of what was said on these occasions. Now if
corresponding summaries of his previous teaching had been handed down in
the Order, and were in constant use among them, at the time when the
Book of the Great Decease was put together, it would be a safe and easy
method to insert such previously existing summaries in the historical
account as having been spoken at the places where the Teacher was
traditionally believed to have spoken on the corresponding doctrines. In
the historical book the simple summaries would sufficiently answer every
purpose; but when each particular matter became the subject of a
separate book or division of a book, the same summaries would be
included, but would be amplified and elucidated. And this is in fact the
relation in which several of the recurring passages, as found in the
Book of the Great Decease, stand to the same passages when found
elsewhere.

On the other hand, some of the recurring passages do not consist of such
summaries, but are actual episodes in the history. As an instance of
these we may take the long extract at the end of the first, and the
beginning of the second chapter (I, 20-II, 3, and again II, 16-II, 24),
which is found also in the Mahâ-vagga. The words are (nearly\[1\])
identical in both places, but in the Book of the Great Decease the
account occurs in its proper place in the middle of a connected
narrative, whereas in the Mahâ-vagga, a treatise on the Rules and
Regulations of the Order, it seems strangely out of place. So the
passage, also a long one, with which the Book of the Great

\[1. On the difference see the note at II, 16. It affects only a few
localising phrases in a narrative occupying (in the translation)
thirteen pages.\]

<span id="page_xxxv">p. xxxv</span> Decease commences (on the Seven
Conditions of Welfare), seems to have been actually borrowed by the
A<u>n</u>guttara Nikâya from our work.

The question of these summaries and parallel passages cannot be
adequately treated by a discussion of the instances found in any one
particular book. It must be considered as a whole, and quite apart from
the allied question of the 'stock phrases' above alluded to, in a
discussion of all the instances that can be found in the Pâli Pi*t*akas.
For this purpose tabulated statements are essential, and as a mere
beginning such a statement is here annexed (including the passages,
marked with an asterisk, which have every appearance of belonging to the
same category).

No Sanskrit work has yet been discovered giving an account of the last
days of Gotama; but there arc several Chinese works. which seem to be
related to ours. Of one especially, named the Fo Pan-ni-pan King
(apparently Buddha-Parinibbâna-Sutta, but such an expression is unknown
in Pâli), Mr. Beal says\[2\]:

'This appears to be the same as the Sûtra known in the South.... It was
translated into Chinese by a Shaman called Fa-tsu, of the Western Tsin
dynasty, circa 200 A.D.'

I do not understand this date. The Western Tsin dynasty is placed by Mr.
Beal himself on the fly-leaf of the Catalogue at 265-313 A.D. And
whether the book referred to is really the same work as the Book of the
Great Decease seems to me to be very doubtful. At p. 160 of his 'Catena
of Buddhist Scriptures from the Chinese' Mr. Beal says, that another
Chinese work 'known as the Mahâ Parinirvâ*n*a Sûtra' 'is evidently the
same as the Mahâ Parinibbâna Sutta of Ceylon,' but it is quite evident
from the extracts which he gives that it is an entirely different and
much later work.

On this book there would seem further to be a translated commentary, Ta
Pan-ni-pan King Lo, mentioned

\[1. Omitted by Po-fa-tsu. See below, p. xxxviii.

2\. Catalogue of Buddhist Chinese Books in the India Office Library, p.
95.\]

<span id="page_xxxvii">p. xxxvii</span>

at p. 100 of the same Catalogue, and there assigned to Chang-an of the
Tsin dynasty (589-619 A.D.).

At pp. 12-13 of the same Catalogue we find no less than seven other
works, and an eighth on p. 77, not indeed identified with the Book of
the Great Decease, but bearing titles which Mr. Beal represents in
Sanskrit as Mahâparinirvâ*n*a Sûtra. They purport to be translated
respectively--

Whether Nos. 1 and 2, and again 3 and 6 are the same is not stated; and
in the Indian Antiquary for 1875 Mr. Beal gives an account of another
undated work, as existing in the India Office Collection, bearing a
different title from any of the above, but which he also translates as
Mahâparinibbâna Sutta. It purports to be the very oldest of the Vaipulya
Sûtras, whereas the book quoted in the Catena is there said to be 'one
of the latest of the expanded Sûtras.'

'The general outline,' says Mr. Beal\[1\], 'is this. Buddha, on a
certain occasion, proceeded to Kinsinagara (sic), and entering a grove
of Sâla trees, there reposed. He received a gift of food from Chanda, an
artisan of the neighbouring town. After partaking of the food he was
seized with illness. He discoursed through the night with his disciples,
and disputed with certain heretical teachers. At early dawn he turned on
his right side with his head to the north, and died. The Sâla trees bent
down to form a canopy over his head. The account then proceeds to relate

\[1. Indian Antiquary, vol. iv. p. 90.\]

<span id="page_xxxviii">p. xxxviii</span>

the circumstances of his cremation, and the subsequent disputes, between
the Mallas and others, for his ashes.'

There is a curious echo here of some of the sections translated below;
though each particular item of the summary is really in contradiction
with the corresponding part of the Pâli book. There is perhaps another
Chinese work on the death of Buddha, of the existence of which I have
been informed, through the kind intervention of Professor Max Müller, by
Mr. Kasawara. It was translated by Po-fa-tsu between 290 and 306 A. D.
It seems to be the same as the first mentioned above, but it contains a
good deal of matter not found in the Mahâ-parinibbâna-Sutta (notably an
account of the Râgagaha Council, the mention of which is so
conspicuously absent from the Pâli work); and it omits many of the
sections found in the Pâli. Mr. Kasawara has been kind enough to send me
the following details regarding those omissions, and they are of
peculiar interest as compared with the table given above\[1\]:

There is no evidence to show that any of the above works are
translations of our Sutta, or in any sense the same work. No reliance,
in fact, can be placed upon the mere similarity of title in order to
show that a Chinese work and an Indian one are really the same: and I
regret that attempts should have been made to fix the date of Indian
works by the fact that Chinese translations bearing similar titles are
said to have been made in a certain period. But the above-mentioned
works on the Great Decease will, when published, throw valuable light on
the traditions of different, though no doubt later, schools of Buddhist
thought; and a detailed comparison would probably throw a very
interesting light on the way in which

\[1. On p. xxxvi.\]

<span id="page_xxxix">p. xxxix</span>

religious legends of this kind vary and grow; and the existence of these
Chinese translations affords ground for the hope that we may some day
discover an earlier Sanskrit work on the same subject\[1\].

------------------------

The cremation ceremonies described in the sixth chapter are not without
interest. It would be natural enough that Gotama should have been buried
without any of those ritualistic forms the usefulness of which he
denied, and without any appeal to gods whose power over men he ignored.
But the tone of the narrative makes it at least possible that there was
not really anything unusual in the method of his cremation; and that the
elaborate rites prescribed in the Brâhmanical books for use at a
funeral\[2\] were not, in practice, observed in the case of the death of
any person other than a wealthy Brâhman, or some layman of rank who was
a devoted adherent of the Brâhmans.

In the same way we find that in those countries where the more ancient
form of Buddhism still prevails, there are a few simple forms to be used
in the case of the cremation of a distinguished Bhikkhu or Upâsaka; but
in ordinary cases bodies are buried without any ceremony.

So in Ceylon, Robert Knox--whose rare and curious work, one of the most
trustworthy books of travels extant, deserves more notice than it has
received, and who was a captive there for many years before the natives
were influenced by any contact with Europeans--says\[3\],

'It may not be unacceptable to relate how they burn their dead. As for
persons of inferior quality, they are interred in some convenient places
in the woods (there being no set places for burial), carried thither by
two or three of their friends, and buried without any more ado. They lay
them on their backs, with their heads to the West, and their feet to the
East, as we do. Then these people go and wash: for they are unclean by
handling the dead.

\[1. I have not been able to trace any reference to either of these
Chinese works in Mr. Edkins's 'Chinese Buddhism.'

2\. See Max Müller in Z. D. M. G., vol. ix.

3\. 'Knox's 'Historical Relation of Ceylon,' Part III, Chap. xi.\]

<span id="page_xl">p. xl</span>

'But persons of greater quality are burned, and that with ceremony. When
they are dead they lay them out, and put a cloth over their privy parts;
and then wash the body, by taking half a dozen pitchers of water and
pouring upon it. Then they cover him with a linen cloth, and so carry
him forth to burning. This is when they burn the body speedily. But
otherwise they cut down a tree that may be proper for their purpose, and
hollow it like a hog-trough, and put the body, being disembowelled and
embalmed, into it, filling up all about with pepper, and so let it lie
in the house until it be the king's command to carry it out to the
burning. For that they dare not do without the king's order if the
person deceased be a courtier. Sometimes the king gives no order in a
great while; it may be not at all: therefore, in such cases, that the
body may not take up house-room or annoy them, they dig a hole in the
floor of their house, and put hollowed tree and all in, and cover it. If
afterwards the king commands to burn the body, they take it up again, in
obedience to the king-otherwise there it lies.

'Their order for burning is this: if the body be not thus put into a
trough or hollow tree, it is laid upon one of his bedsteads, which is a
great honour among them. This bedstead with the body on it, or hollowed
tree with the body in it, is fastened with poles, and carried upon men's
shoulders unto the place of burning, which is some eminent place in the
fields, or highways, or where else they please. There they lay it upon a
pile of wood some two or three feet high;--then they pile up more wood
upon the corpse, lying thus on the bedstead or in the trough. Over all
they have a kind of canopy built (if he be a person of very high
quality), covered at top, hung about with painted cloth, and bunches of
cocoa-nuts, and green boughs; and so fire is put to it. After all is
burnt to ashes, they sweep together the ashes into the manner of a
sugar-loaf, and hedge the place round from wild beasts breaking in, and
they will sow herbs there. Thus I saw the king's uncle, the chief
tirinanx\[1\] (who was, as it were, the chief primate of all the

\[1. Knox's way of spelling Terunnânsê, that is, Thera.\]

<span id="page_xli">p. xli</span>

nation), burned upon a high place, that the blaze might be seen a great
way\[1\].'

I myself saw an Unnânsê burned very much in this way near the Weyangoda
Court-house; and there is a long account in the native newspaper, the
Lak-riwi-kirana (Ceylon Sunbeam), of the 12th March, 1870, Of the
cremation of a Weda-râla, or native doctor. Bishop Bigandet relates in a
note in his 'Life or Legend of Gautama' the corresponding ceremonies
still in use in Burma, of which he has been a witness\[2\]; but
cremation is apparently as seldom resorted to in Burma as it is in
Ceylon.

The unceremonious mode of burying the dead referred to by Knox is not
adopted in the more settled districts on the sea coast. When at Galle I
enquired into the funeral customs there prevalent, with the following
result\[3\]:

A few hours after a man has died, the relations wash the corpse, shave
it; and, having clothed it with a strip of clean white cloth, place it
on a bedstead covered with white cloth, and under a canopy (wiyana) also
of white cloth. They then place two lamps, one to burn at the head, and
the other at the foot of the corpse, and use perfumes.

A coffin is then prepared, covered with black cloth; and the body is
placed on the coffin, and is then sprinkled over with lavender or
rose-water. The women meanwhile bow backwards and forwards with their
hands behind their heads, uttering loud wailings over the deceased.

Then the male relatives carry the coffin to the grave, which is dug in
one of their own cocoa-nut topes near by, and over which is raised a
more or less elaborate canopy or arch of cloths and evergreens
(ge*d*i-ge), adorned with the tender leaves and flowers of the
cocoa-nut. Along the path also from the house to the grave young
cocoa-nut leaves and flowers are sometimes hung, and the pathway itself
is often spread with clean white cloths.

The tom-tom beaters go first; and the dull monotonous

\[1. In the older editions of Knox there is a curious engraving of a
body being thus burnt.

2\. Third edition, vol. ii. pp. 78, 79.

3\. See the Ceylon Friend for 1870, pp. 109 and following.\]

<span id="page_xlii">p. xlii</span>

sound of their instruments of music is appropriate enough. Then follow
some Buddhist mendicants, in number according to the wealth or influence
of the deceased, and walking under a portable canopy of white cloth.
Then the coffin is carried by the nearest male relatives, and followed
by other male relatives and relations--no females, even the widowed
mother of an only son, taking part in this last sad procession.

Three times the coffin is carried round the grave: then it is placed on
two sticks placed across the mouth of the pit; and one end of a roll of
white cloth is placed on the coffin, the other end being held by all the
Unnânsês (Bhikkhus) whilst the people repeat three times in Pâli the
well-known formula of the Refuges (the simple Nicene Creed of the
Buddhists):

'I take my refuge in the Buddha,  
I take my refuge in the Dhamma,  
I take my refuge in the Order\[1\].'

Then the priests respond, thrice repeating in Pâli the well-known verse
discussed below\[2\]:

'How transient are all component things!  
Their nature's to be born and die;  
Coming, they go; and then is best,  
When each has ceased, and all is rest!'

Then the Unnânsês let go the roll of white cloth, and whilst water is
poured from a goblet into a cup placed on a plate until the cup is full
to the brim\[3\], they again chaunt three times in Pâli the following
verses:--

\[1.

Buddha*m* sara*n*a*m* ga*kkh*âmi  
Dhamma*m* sara*n*a*m* ga*kkh*âmi  
Sa*m*gha*m* sara*n*a*m* ga*kkh*âmi.

2\.

Ani*kk*â vata sa*m*khârâ uppâdavaya-dhammino  
Uppa*gg*itvâ niru*ggh*anti tesa*m* vûpasamo sukho.

See 'Book of the Great Decease,' VI, 16, and the 'Legend of the Great
King of Glory,' II, 42.

3\. This ceremony is called Pæ*m* wadanawâ.\]

'As rivers, when they fill, must flow,  
And reach, and fill the distant main; <span id="page_xliii">p.
xliii</span>

So surely what is given here  
Will reach and bless the spirits there!

If you on earth will gladly give  
Departed ghosts will gladly live!

As water poured on mountain tops  
Must soon descend, and reach the plain;  
    So surely what is given here  
    Will reach and bless the sprits there\[1\]!'

The relations then place the coffin. in the grave, and each throws in a
handful of earth. The Unnânsês then go away, taking the roll or rolls of
cloth, one end of which was placed upon the coffin. The grave is filled
in. Two lights, one at the head of it, and one at the foot, are left
burning. And then the friends and relations return to the house.

The funeral now being over, is followed by a feast; for though nothing
may be cooked in a house or hut in which there is a corpse, yet plenty
of food has been brought in from neighbouring tenements by the relations
of the deceased.

There is, however, yet another very curious ceremony to be gone through.
Three or seven days--whichever, according to the rules of astrology, is
a lucky day--after the deceased person died, an Unnânsê is duly invited
to the house in which the deceased died. He arrives in the evening;
reads bana (that is, the Word, passages from the sacred books)
throughout the night; and in the morning is presented with a roll of
white cloth, and is asked to partake of food, chiefly of course curries,
of those different kinds of which the deceased had been most
particularly fond.

\[1.

Yathâ vârivahâ pûrâ paripûrenti sâgara*m*  
Evam eva ito dinna*m* petânam upakappati.

Ito dinnena yâpenti petâ kâlakatâ tahi*m*.

Unname udaka*m* va*tt*a*m* yathâ ninna*m* pavattati  
Evam, eva ito dinna*m* petâna*m* upakappati.

These verses occur in the Tiroku*dd*a-Sutta of the Khuddaka-Pâ*th*a, but
in a different order.\]

<span id="page_xliv">p. xliv</span>

This ceremony is called Mataka Dânaya, (Gift for the Dead), and the
previous feast is called Mataka Bhatta (Feast in honour of the Dead):
the two combined taking the place of an ancient rite observed in pagan,
pre-Buddhistic, times, and then also called Mataka Bhatta, in which
offerings were made to the Petas; that is, to the manes, or departed
ghosts, of ancestors and near relations. Such offerings are of course
forbidden to Buddhists\[1\], and it is a very instructive instance of a
survival in belief, of the effect of the natural reluctance to make much
change in the mode of paying the customary funeral respect to deceased
friends, that the kind of food supposed to be most appreciated by the
dead should still be used in the Buddhist funeral rites.

Another part of the ceremony, that part where one end of a roll of cloth
is placed on the coffin while the other end is held by all the assembled
Unnânsês\[2\], is a fragment of ritualistic symbolism which deserves
attention. The members of the Buddhist Order of Mendicants were enjoined
to avoid all personal decoration of any kind; and to attire themselves
in cloths of no value, such as might be gathered from a dust heap
(Pa*m*su-kûla), or even from a cemetery. This was a principle to be
followed, not a literal rule to be observed; and therefore from the
first presents of strips of plain white cotton cloth, first torn in
pieces to deprive them of any commercial value, then pieced together
again and dyed a dull orange colour to call to mind the colour of old
worn out linen, were the material from which the mendicants' clothing
was actually made. But the duty of contempt for dress (called
Pa*m*su-kûlika<u>n</u>ga, from the dust heap) was never lost sight of,
and advantage was taken of the gifts given by the faithful at funerals
to impress this duty upon the minds of the assembled Bhikkhus.

Nothing is known of any religious ceremony having been performed by the
early Buddhists in India, whether the person deceased was a layman, or
even a member of the

\[1. Compare the Mataka-Bhatta-*G*âtaka (No. 18), translated in
'Buddhist Birth Stories,' vol. i. pp. 226 and following.

2\. Seep. xlii.\]

<span id="page_xlv">p. xlv</span> Order. The Vinaya Pi*t*aka, which
enters at so great length into all the details of the daily life of the
recluses, has no rules regarding the mode of treating the body of a
deceased Bhikkhu. It was probably burnt, and very much in the manner
described in the last chapter of our Sutta--that is to say, it was
reverently carried out to some convenient spot, and there simply
cremated on a funeral pyre without any religious ritual, a small tope
being more often than not erected over the ashes. Though funerals are,
naturally, not unfrequently mentioned in the historical books, and in
the Birth Stories, there is nowhere any reference to a recognised mode
of performing any religious ceremony\[1\].

------------------------

The date of the Great Decease is not quite certain. The dwellers in the
valley of the Ganges, for many generations after Gotama's death, were a
happy people, who had no need of dates; and it was only long afterwards,
and in Ceylon, that the great event became used as the starting-point
for chronological calculations, as the Buddhist era.

The earliest use of the Buddha's Parinibbâna as such an era is in an
Inscription of King Nissanka Malla's, of the twelfth century A.D.,
published by me in the journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1875.
Both in the historical records of Ceylon, and in those passages of the
Purâ*n*as which are the nearest approach to historical records in India,
the chronology is usually based on the lists of kings, just as it is in
the Old Testament. Only by adding together the lengths of the reigns of
the intermediate kings is it possible to calculate the length of the
time that is said to have elapsed between any two given events.

If these lists of kings had been accurately kept from

refer to pagan rites.

3\. On funerals among Buddhists in Japan, see Miss Bird's 'Unbeaten
Tracks,' vol. i.\]

<span id="page_xlvi">p. xlvi</span>

Gotama's time to the time when the existing chronicles were compiled, we
should be able, if we could fix the date of any one of the kings, to
calculate the date of the Buddha's death. This last we can do; for the
date of Kandragupta, and the date of his grandson Asoka, can be
independently fixed within a few years by the aid of the Greek
historians. But unfortunately the earlier parts of the otherwise
reliable Ceylon chronicles are, like the earlier parts of Livy's
otherwise reliable history of Rome, full of inconsistencies, and
impossibilities.

According to the Râ*g*a-paramparâ, or line of kings, in the Ceylon
chronicles, the date of the Great Decease would be 543 B.C., which is
arrived at by adding to the date 161 B.C. (from which the reliable
portion of the history begins) two periods of 146 and 236 years. The
first purports to give the time which elapsed between 161 B.C. and the
great Buddhist church Council held under Asoka, and in the eighteenth
year of his reign, at Patna; and the second to give the interval between
that Council and the Buddha's death.

It would result from the first calculation that the date of Asoka's
coronation would be 325 B.C. (146 + 161 + 18). But we know that this
must contain a blunder or blunders, as the date of Asoka's coronation
can be fixed, as above stated, with absolute certainty within a year or
two either way of 267 B.C.

Would it then be sound criticism to accept the other, earlier, period of
236 years found in those chronicles--a period which we cannot test by
Greek chronology--and by simply adding the Ceylon calculation of 236
years to the European date for the eighteenth year of Asoka (that in
circa 249 B.C.) to conclude that the Buddha died in or about 485 B.C.?

I cannot think so. The further we go back the greater does the
probability of error become, not less. The most superficial examination
of the details of this earlier period shows too, that they are
unreliable; and what reliance would it be wise to place upon the total,
apart from the details, when we find it mentioned for the first time in

<span id="page_xlvii">p. xlvii</span>

a work, the Dîpava*m*sa, written eight centuries after the date it is
proposed to fix?

If further proof were needed, we have it in the fact that the
Dîpava*m*sa actually contains the details of another calculation--based
not on the lists of kings (Râ*g*a-paramparâ), but on a list of Theras
(Thera-paramparâ) stretching back from Asoka's time to the time of the
great Teacher--which contradicts this calculation of 236 years.

The Thera-paramparâ gives the name of the member of the Buddhist Order
of Mendicants, that is, the Thera, who ordained Mahinda (the son of
Asoka), then the name of the Thera who ordained that Thera, and so on.
There are only five of them from Upâli, who was ordained sixteen years
after Buddha's death, down to Mahinda inclusive. This would account not
for 236, but only for about 150 years.

For let the reader take the case of any clergyman in the present day.
The Bishop who ordains him would have been ordained thirty or forty
years before; and four such intervals would fill out, not 236 years, but
about a century and a half; and a similar argument applies with
reasonable certainty to the case in point.

An examination of the details of the List of Theras confirms this
conclusion strongly on every essential point. An examination also of the
List of Kings shows that the period of 236 years is wrong by being too
long. The shorter period of 150 years between Asoka and the Great
Decease agrees much better with what we know of the literary history of
Buddhism during that interval. And it also agrees with the tradition of
the northern Buddhists as preserved by Hiouen Thsang, and in Kashmir and
Tibet\[1\]. In the 'Questions of Milinda' also--a work of unknown date,
preserved only in its Pâli form, but

\[1. Julien's translation of Hiouen Thsang, 'Mémoires sur les contrées
occidentales,' vol. i. p. 172; Kahla*n*a's Râga-tara<u>n</u>ginî, Book
I; and Csoma Körösi in 'Asiatic Researches; vol. xx. pp. 92, 297. They
place the Great Decease 400 years before Kanishka, whose Council was
held shortly after the commencement of our era.\]

<span id="page_xlviii">p. xlviii</span>

possibly derived from a northern Buddhist Sanskrit work--the date of the
Buddha's death is fixed at five hundred years before the time of
Milinda\[1\], who certainly reigned about a century after Christ. I am,
therefore, of opinion that the hitherto accepted date of the Buddha's
death should be modified accordingly.

This would make the date of the Great Decease about 420-400 B.C. (very
possibly a year or two later), and the date of Gotama's birth therefore
eighty years earlier, or in round numbers about 500 B.C.

I have discussed the whole question at full length in my 'Ancient Coins
and Measures of Ceylon,' written in amplification of a paper read in
1874 before the Royal Asiatic Society; and to that work I must refer any
reader, who may take interest in these chronological discussions, for
ampler details. I have been able here to present only a summary of an
argument which is in so far of little importance, inasmuch as the
rectification which I have ventured to propose only differs by a little
more than half a century from the earliest date which can in any case be
suggested as approximately correct (that is about 485 B.C.). The date
543 B.C., still unfortunately accepted outside the circle of students of
Buddhism\[2\], is now acknowledged to be too early by all scholars who
have seriously considered the subject.

### CHAPTER I.

1<sup>\[1\]</sup>. Thus have I heard. The Blessed One was once dwelling
in Râ*g*agaha, on the hill called the Vulture's Peak. Now at that time
A*g*âtasattu, the son of the queen-consort of Videha origin\[2\], the
king of Magadha, was desirous of attacking the Va*gg*ians; and he said
to himself, 'I will root out these Va*gg*ians,

\[1. Sections 1-10, inclusive, recur in the Va*gg*i Vagga of the Sutta
Nipâta in the Anguttara Nikâya; and there is a curiously incorrect
version of § 3 in the Fa Kheu Pi Hu, translated from the Chinese by Mr.
Beal, under the title of 'The Dhammapada from the Buddhist Canon,' pp.
165, 166.

2\. A*g*âtasattu Vedehiputto. The first word is not a personal name, but
an official epithet, 'he against whom there has arisen no (worthy or
equal) foe;' the second gives us the maiden family, or tribal (not
personal) name of his mother. Persons of distinction are scarcely ever
mentioned by name in Indian Buddhist books, a rule applying more
especially to kings, but extended not unfrequently to private persons.
Thus Upatissa, the earnest and thoughtful disciple whom the Buddha
himself declared to be 'the second founder of the kingdom of
righteousness,' is referred to either as Dhamma-senâpati or as
Sâriputta; epithets of corresponding origin to those in the text. By the
Gains Agâtasattu is called Kû*n*ika or Ko*n*ika, which again is probably
not the name given to him at the rice-eating (the ceremony corresponding
to infant baptism), but a nickname acquired in after life.\]

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

mighty and powerful\[1\] though they be, I will destroy these
Va*gg*ians, I will bring these Va*gg*ians to utter ruin!'

2\. So he spake to the Brâhman Vassakâra, the prime-minister of Magadha,
and said:

'Come now, O Brâhman, do you go to the Blessed One, and bow down in
adoration at his feet on my behalf, and enquire in my name whether he is
free from illness and suffering, and in the enjoyment of case and
comfort, and vigorous health. Then tell him that A*g*âtasattu, son of
the Vedehi, the king of Magadha, in his eagerness to attack the
Va*gg*ians, has resolved, "I will root out these Va*gg*ians, mighty and
powerful though they be, I will destroy these Va*gg*ians, I will bring
these Va*gg*ians to utter ruin!" And bear carefully in mind whatever the
Blessed One may predict, and repeat it to me. For the Buddhas speak
nothing untrue!'

3\. Then the Brâhman Vassakâra, hearkened to the words of the king,
saying, 'Be it as you say.' And ordering a number of magnificent
carriages to be made ready, he mounted one of them, left Râ*g*agaha with
his train, and went to the Vulture's Peak, riding as far as the ground
was passable for carriages,

\[1. Evammahiddhike evammahânubhâve. There is nothing supernatural about
the iddhi here referred to. Etena tesan samagga-bhâvan kathesi says the
commentator simply: thus referring the former adjective to the power of
union, as he does the second to the power derived from practice in
military tactics (hatthisippâdîhi). The epithets are, indeed, most
commonly applied to the supernatural powers of Devatâs, Nâgas, and other
fairy-like beings; but they are also used, sometimes in the simple sense
of this passage, and sometimes in the other sense, of Buddhas and of
other Arahats. See M. P. S. 12, 43; M. Sud. S. 49-53; *G*ât. I, 34, 35,
39, 41.\]

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

and then alighting and proceeding on foot to the place where the Blessed
One was. On arriving there he exchanged with the Blessed One the
greetings and compliments of friendship and civility, sat down
respectfully by his side \[and then delivered to him the message even as
the king had commanded<sup>\[1\]</sup>\].

4\. Now at that time the venerable Ânanda was standing behind the
Blessed One, and fanning him. And the Blessed One said to him: 'Have you
heard, Ânanda, that the Va*gg*ians hold full and frequent public
assemblies?'

'Lord, so I have heard,' replied he.

'So long, Ânanda,' rejoined the Blessed One, 'as the Va*gg*ians hold
these full and frequent public assemblies; so long may they be expected
not to decline, but to prosper.'

\[And in like manner questioning Ânanda, and receiving a similar reply,
the Blessed One declared as follows the other conditions which would
ensure the welfare of the Va*gg*ian confederacy<sup>\[2\]</sup>.\]

'So long, Ânanda, as the Va*gg*ians meet together in concord, and rise
in concord, and carry out their undertakings in concord--so long as they
enact nothing not already established, abrogate nothing that has been
already enacted, and act in accordance with the ancient institutions of
the Va*gg*ians as established in former days--so long as they honour and
esteem and revere and support the Va*gg*ian elders, and hold it a point
of duty to hearken to their words--so long as no women or girls

\[1. § 2 repeated.

2\. In the text there is a question, answer, and reply with each
clause.\]

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

belonging to their clans are detained among them by force or
abduction--so long as they honour and esteem and revere and support the
Va*gg*ian shrines\[1\] in town or country, and allow not the proper
offerings and rites, as formerly given and performed, to fall into
desuetude--so long as the rightful protection, defence, and support
shall be fully provided for the Arahats among them, so that Arahats from
a distance may enter the realm, and the Arahats therein may live at
case--so long may the Va*gg*ians be expected not to decline, but to
prosper.'

5\. Then the Blessed One addressed Vassakâra the Brâhman, and said:

'When I was once staying, O Brâhman, at Vesâli at the Sârandada
Temple\[1\], I taught the Va*gg*ians these conditions of welfare; and so
long as those conditions shall continue to exist among the Va*gg*ians,
so long as the Va*gg*ians shall be well instructed in those conditions,
so long may we expect them not to decline, but to prosper.'

'We may expect then,' answered the Brâhman, 'the welfare and not the
decline of the Vaggians when they are possessed of any one of these
conditions of welfare, how much more so when they are possessed of all
the seven. So, Gotama, the Va*gg*ians cannot be overcome by the king of
Magadha; that is, not in battle, without diplomacy or breaking up their
alliance\[3\]. And now, Gotama, we must go; we are busy, and have much

2\. The commentator adds that this was a vihâra erected on the site of a
former temple of the Yakkha Sârandada.

3\. 'Overcome' is literally 'done' (akara*n*iyâ), but the word evidently
has a similar sense to that which 'done' occasionally has {footnote p.
5} in colloquial English. The Sum. Vil. (fol. *t*î) says akara*n*iyâ,

'humbug, cajolery, diplomacy;' see the use of the verb upa-lâpeti, at
Mahâ Vagga V, 2, 21; *G*ât. II, 266, 267; Pât. in the 70th Pâ*k*. Sum.
Vil. explains it, at some length, as making an alliance, by gifts, with
hostile intent, which comes to much the same thing. The root I think is
lî.\]

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

'Whatever you think most fitting, O Brâhman,' was the reply. And the
Brâhman Vassakâra, delighted and pleased with the words of the Blessed
One, rose from his seat, and went his way.

6\. Now soon after he had gone the Blessed One addressed the venerable
Ânanda, and said: 'Go now, Ânanda, and assemble in the Service Hall such
of the Brethren\[1\] as live in the neighbourhood of Râgagaha.'

\[1. The word translated 'brethren' throughout is in the original
bhikkhû, a word most difficult to render adequately by any word which
would not, to Christians and in Europe, connote something different from
the Buddhist idea. A bhikkhu, literally 'beggar,' was a disciple who had
joined Gotama's order; but the word refers to their renunciation of
worldly things, rather than to their consequent mendicancy; and they did
not really beg in our modern sense of the word. Hardy has 'priests;' I
have elsewhere used ( monks' and sometimes 'beggars' and 'members of the
order.' This last is, I think, the best rendering; but it is too long
for constant repetition, as in this passage, and too complex to be a
really good version of bhikkhu. The members of the order were not
priests, for they had no priestly powers. They were not monks, for they
took no vow of obedience, and could leave the order (and constantly did
so and do so still) whenever they chose. They were not beggars, for they
had none of the mental and moral qualities associated with that word.
'Brethren' connotes very much the position in which they stood to one
another; but I wish there were a better word to use in rendering
bhikkhu.\]

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

And he did so; and returned to the Blessed One, and informed him,
saying:

'The company of the Brethren, Lord, is assembled, let the Blessed One do
as seemeth to him fit.'

And the Blessed One arose, and went to the Service Hall; and when he was
seated, he addressed the Brethren, and said:

'I will teach you, O mendicants, seven conditions of the welfare of a
community. Listen well and attend, and I will speak.'

'Even so, Lord,' said the Brethren, in assent, to the Blessed One; and
he spake as follows:

'So long, O mendicants, as the brethren meet together in full and
frequent assemblies--so long as they meet together in concord, and rise
in concord, and carry out in concord the duties of the order--so long as
the brethren shall establish nothing that has not been already
prescribed, and abrogate nothing that has been already established, and
act in accordance with the rules of the order as now laid down--so long
as the brethren honour and esteem and revere and support the elders of
experience and long standing, the fathers and leaders of the order, and
hold it a point of duty to hearken to their words--so long as the
brethren fall not under the influence of that craving which, springing
up within them, would give rise to renewed existence\[1\]--so long as
the brethren delight in a life of solitude--so long as the brethren so
train their minds\[2\] that good and holy men shall come to them, and
those who have come shall dwell at case

\[1. 'Ponobhavikâ' punabbhava-dâyikâ. (S. V. fol. *t*û.)

2\. 'Pa*kk*atta*m* yeva sati*m* upa*tth*âpessantî' ti attano abbhantare

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

--so long may the brethren be expected, not to decline, but to prosper.
So long as these seven conditions shall continue to exist among the
brethren, so long as they are well-instructed in these conditions, so
long may the brethren be expected not to decline, but to prosper.'

7\. 'Other seven conditions of welfare will I teach you, O brethren.
Listen well, and attend, and I will speak.'

And on their expressing their assent, he spake as follows:

'So long as the brethren shall not engage in, or be fond of, or be
connected with business--so long as the brethren shall not be in the
habit of or be fond of, or be partakers in idle talk--so long as the
brethren shall not be addicted to, or be fond of, or indulge in
slothfulness--so long as the brethren shall not frequent, or be fond of,
or indulge in society--so long as the brethren shall neither have, nor
fall under the influence of, sinful desires--so long as the brethren
shall not become the friends, companions, or intimates of sinners--so
long as the brethren shall not come to a stop on their way \[to
Nirvâ*n*a<sup>\[1\]</sup>\] because they

which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,
I press toward the mark,' &c. See also below, Chap. V, § 68.\]

not to decline, but to prosper.

'So long as these conditions shall continue to exist among the brethren,
so long as they are instructed in these conditions, so long may the
brethren be expected not to decline, but to prosper.'

8\. 'Other seven conditions of welfare will I teach you, O brethren.
Listen well, and attend, and I will speak.'

And on their expressing their assent, he spake as follows:

'So long as the brethren shall be full of faith, modest in heart, afraid
of sin\[1\], full of learning, strong in energy, active in mind, and
full of wisdom, so long may the brethren be expected not to decline, but
to prosper.

'So long as these conditions shall continue to exist among the brethren,
so long as they are instructed in these conditions, so long may the
brethren be expected not to decline, but to prosper.'

9\. 'Other seven conditions of welfare will I teach you, O brethren.
Listen well, and attend, and I will speak.'

And on their expressing their assent, he spake as follows:

\[1. The exact distinction between hiri and ottappa is here explained by
Buddhaghosa as follows:

'Hirimanâ' ti pâpa-*g*igu*kkh*ana-lakkha*n*âya hiriyâ yutta*k*ittâ.
'Ottâpî' ti pâpato, bhaya-lakkha*n*ena ottappena samannâgatâ: that is,
loathing sin as contrasted with fear of sin. But this is rather a gloss
than an exact and exclusive definition. Ahirikâ is shamelessness,
anotappa*m* forwardness. At *G*ât. I, 207 we find hiri described as
subjective, and ottappa as objective, modesty of heart as contrasted
with decency in outward behaviour.\]

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

'So long as the brethren shall exercise themselves in the sevenfold
higher wisdom, that is to say, in mental activity, search after truth,
energy, joy, peace, earnest contemplation, and equanimity of mind, so
long may the brethren be expected not to decline, but to prosper.

'So long as these conditions shall continue to exist among the brethren,
so long as they are instructed in these conditions, so long may the
brethren be expected not to decline, but to prosper.'

10\. 'Other seven conditions of welfare will I teach you, O brethren.
Listen well, and attend, and I will speak.'

And on their expressing their assent, he spake as follows:

'So long as the brethren shall exercise themselves in the sevenfold
perception due to earnest thought, that is to say, the perception of
impermanency, of non-individuality\[1\], of corruption, of the danger of
sin, of sanctification, of purity of heart, of Nirvâ*n*a, so long may
the brethren be expected not to decline, but to prosper.

'So long as these conditions shall continue to exist among the brethren,
so long as they are instructed in these conditions, so long may the
brethren be expected not to decline, but to prosper.'

11\. 'Six conditions of welfare will I teach you, O brethren. Listen
well, and attend, and I will speak.'

And on their expressing their assent, he spake as follows:

\[1. For a further explanation of the meaning of anatta*m* see Gotama's
second discourse in the Mahâ Vagga I, 6: 38-47. Buddhaghosa makes no
special comment here on either of the seven perceptions.\]

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

'So long as the brethren shall persevere in kindness of action, speech,
and thought amongst the saints, both in public and in private--so long
as they shall divide without partiality, and share in common with the
upright and the holy, all such things as they receive in accordance with
the just provisions of the order, down even to the mere contents of a
begging bowl--so long as the brethren shall live among the saints in the
practice, both in public and in private, of those virtues which
(unbroken, intact, unspotted, unblemished) are productive of
freedom\[1\], and praised by the wise; which are untarnished by the
desire of future life, or by the belief in the efficacy of outward
acts\[2\]; and which are conducive to high and holy thoughts--so long as
the brethren shall live among the saints, cherishing, both in public and
in private, that noble and saving faith which leads to the complete
destruction of the sorrow of him who acts according to it--so long may
the brethren be expected not to decline, but to prosper.

'So long as these six conditions shall continue to

bring one to the state of a free man by delivering him from the slavery
of craving.'

because they are untarnished by craving or delusion, and because no one
can say of him who practises them, "you have been already guilty of such
and such a sin."' Craving is here the hope of a future life in heaven,
and delusion the belief in the efficacy of rites and ceremonies (the two
nissayas) which are condemned as unworthy inducements to virtue.\]

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

exist among the brethren so long as they are instructed in these six
conditions, so long may the brethren be expected not to decline, but to
prosper.'

------------------------

12\. And whilst the Blessed One stayed there at Râ*g*agaha on the
Vulture's Peak he held that comprehensive religious talk with the
brethren on the nature of upright conduct, and of earnest contemplation,
and of intelligence. 'Great is the fruit, great the advantage of earnest
contemplation when set round with upright conduct. Great is the fruit,
great the advantage of intellect when set round with earnest
contemplation. The mind set round with intelligence is freed from the
great evils, that is to say, from sensuality, from individuality, from
delusion, and from ignorance\[1\].'

\[1. This paragraph is spoken of as if it were a well-known summary, and
it is constantly repeated below. The word I have rendered 'earnest
contemplation' is samâdhi, which occupies in the Pâli Pi*t*akas very
much the same position as faith does in the New Testament; and this
section shows that the relative importance of samâdhi, pa*ññ*â, and sîla
played a part in early Buddhism just as the distinction between faith,
reason, and works did afterwards in Western theology. It would be
difficult to find a passage in which the Buddhist view of the relation
of these conflicting ideas is stated with greater beauty of thought, or
equal succinctness of form.

2\. The expression 'set round with' is in Pâli paribhâvita, which Dr.
Morris holds to be etymologically exactly parallel to our phrase
'perfected by,' on the ground that facio is a causal of the Latin
representative of the Sanskrit root bhû. In the *K*etokhila Sutta of the
Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya eggs are said to be paribhâvitâni by a brooding hen.
Buddhaghosa says simply sîla-paribhâvito ti âdesu yamhi sîle *th*atvâ
magga-samâdhi*m* nibbattenti so tena sîlena paribhâvito. 'The samâdhi
belonging to the (Noble Eightfold) Path is said to be paribhâvito by
that virtue, in which they (that is, the converted) are steadfast whilst
they practise the samâdhi.'\]

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

13\. Now when the Blessed One had sojourned at Râ*g*agaha as long as he
pleased, he addressed the venerable Ânanda, and said: 'Come, Ânanda, let
us go to Ambala*tth*ikâ.'

'So be it, Lord!' said Ânanda in assent, and the Blessed One, with a
large company of the brethren, proceeded to Ambala*tth*ikâ.

14\. There the Blessed One stayed in the king's house and held that
comprehensive religious talk with the brethren on the nature of upright
conduct, and of earnest contemplation, and of intelligence. 'Great is
the fruit, great the advantage of earnest contemplation when set round
with upright conduct. Great is the fruit, great the advantage of
intellect when set round with earnest contemplation. The mind set round
with intelligence is freed from the great evils, that is to say, from
sensuality, from individuality, from delusion, and from ignorance.'

------------------------

15\. Now when the Blessed One had stayed as long as was convenient at
Ambala*tth*ikâ, he addressed the venerable Ânanda, and said: 'Come,
Ânanda, let us go on to Nâlandâ.'

'So be it, Lord!' said Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed One.

Then the Blessed One proceeded, with a great company of the brethren, to
Nâlandâ; and there, at Nâlandâ, the Blessed One stayed in the Pâvârika
mango grove.

16\. \[1\]Now the venerable Sâriputta came to the

\[1. This conversation is given at length in the Sampasâdaniya Sutta of
the Dîgha Nikâya, and also in the Satipa*tth*âna Vagga of the Sa*m*yutta
Nikâya. I have compressed mere repetitions at the places marked with
\[ \] where the preceding clauses are, in the text, repeated in full.\]

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

place where the Blessed One was, and having saluted him, took his seat
respectfully at his side, and said: 'Lord! such faith have I in the
Blessed One, that methinks there never has been, nor will there be, nor
is there now any other, whether Sama*n*a or Brâhman, who is greater and
wiser than the Blessed One, that is to say, as regards the higher
wisdom.'

'Grand and bold are the words of thy mouth, Sâriputta: verily, thou hast
burst forth into a song of ecstasy! of course then thou hast known all
the Blessed Ones who in the long ages of the past have been Arahat
Buddhas, comprehending their minds with yours, and aware what their
conduct was, what their doctrine, what their wisdom, what their mode of
life, and what salvation they attained to?'

'Not so, O Lord!'

'Of course then thou hast perceived all the Blessed Ones who in the long
ages of the future shall be Arahat Buddhas comprehending \[in the same
manner their whole minds with yours\]?'

Not so, O Lord!'

But at least then, O Sâriputta, thou knowest me as the Arahat Buddha now
alive, and hast penetrated my mind \[in the manner I have mentioned\]!'

'Not even that, O Lord!'

'You see then, Sâriputta, that you know not the hearts of the Arahat
Buddhas of the past and of the future. Why therefore are your words so
grand and bold? Why do you burst forth into such a song of ecstasy?'

17\. 'O Lord! I have not the knowledge of the hearts of the Arahat
Buddhas that have been, and are to come, and now are. I only know the
lineage

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

of the faith. just, Lord, as a king might have a border city, strong in
its foundations, strong in its ramparts and tora*n*as, and with one gate
alone; and the king might have a watchman there, clever, expert, and
wise, to stop all strangers and admit only friends. And he, on going
over the approaches all round the city, might not so observe all the
joints and crevices in the ramparts of that city as to know where even a
cat could get out. That might well be. Yet all living things of larger
size that entered or left the city, would have to do so by that gate.
Thus only is it, Lord, that I know the lineage of the faith. I know that
the Arahat Buddhas of the past, putting away all lust, ill-will, sloth,
pride, and doubt; knowing all those mental faults which make men weak;
training their minds in the four kinds of mental activity; thoroughly
exercising themselves in the sevenfold higher wisdom, received the full
fruition of Enlightenment. And I know that the Arahat Buddhas of the
times to come will \[do the same\]. And I know that the Blessed One, the
Arahat Buddha of to-day, has \[done so\] now\[1\].'

------------------------

18\. There in the Pavârika mango grove the Blessed One held that
comprehensive religious talk

\[1. The tertium quid of the comparison is the completeness of the
knowledge. Sâriputta acknowledges that he was wrong in jumping to the
wide conclusion that his own lord and master was the wisest of all the
teachers of the different religious systems that were known to him. So
far--after the cross-examination by the Buddha--he admits that his
knowledge does not reach. But he maintains that he does know that which
is, to him, after all the main thing, namely, that all the Buddhas must
have passed through the process here laid down as leading up to
Buddhahood. The Pâli of 'the full fruition of Enlightenment' is
anuttara*m* sammâsambodhi*m*, which might be rendered 'Supreme
Buddhahood.'\]

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

with the brethren on the nature of upright conduct, and of earnest
contemplation, and of intelligence. 'Great is the fruit, great the
advantage of earnest contemplation when set round with upright conduct.
Great is the fruit, great the advantage of intellect when set round with
earnest contemplation. The mind set round with intelligence is freed
from the great evils, that is to say, from sensuality, from
individuality, from delusion, and from ignorance.'

------------------------

19\. Now when the Blessed One had stayed as long as was convenient at
Nâlandâ, he addressed the venerable Ânanda, and said: 'Come, Ânanda, let
us go on to Pâ*t*aligâma.'

'So be it, Lord!' said Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed One.

Then the Blessed One proceeded, with a great company of the brethren, to
Pâ*t*aligâma.

20\. \[1\] Now the disciples at Pâ*t*aligâma heard of his arrival there,
and they went to the place where he was, took their seats respectfully
beside him, and invited him to their village rest house. And the Blessed
One signified, by silence, his consent.

21\. Then the Pâ*t*aligâma disciples seeing that he had accepted the
invitation, rose from their seats, and went away to the rest house,
bowing to the Blessed One and keeping him on their right as they past
him\[2\]. On arriving there they made the rest

\[1. From this sentence down to the end of the verses at Chap. II, § 3,
is, with a few unimportant variations, word for word the same as Mahâ
Vagga VI, 28, 1, to VI, 29, 2.

2\. It would be very rude to have left him otherwise. So in Europe a
similar custom is carried still further, persons leaving the royal
presence being expected to go out backwards.\]

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

house fit in every way for occupation\[1\], placed seats in it, set up a
water-pot, and fixed an oil lamp. Then they returned to the Blessed One,
and bowing, stood beside him, and said: 'All things are ready, Lord! It
is time for you to do what you deem most fit.'

22\. And the Blessed One robed himself, took his bowl and other things,
went with the brethren to the rest house, washed his feet, entered the
hall, and took his seat against the centre pillar, with his face towards
the east. And the brethren also, after washing their feet, entered the
hall, and took their seats round the Blessed One, against the western
wall, and facing the cast. And the Pâ*t*aligâma disciples too, after
washing their feet, entered the hall, and took their seats opposite the
Blessed One, against the eastern wall, and facing towards the west.

23\. \[2\] Then the Blessed One addressed the Pâ*t*aligâma disciples,
and said: 'Fivefold, O householders, is the loss of the wrong-doer
through his want of rectitude. In the first place the wrong-doer, devoid
of rectitude, falls into great poverty through sloth; in the next place
his evil repute gets noised abroad; thirdly, whatever society he
enters--whether of Brâhmans, nobles, heads of houses, or Sama*n*as--

\[1. With reference to Oldenberg's note at Mahâ Vagga, p. 384, it may be
mentioned that Buddhaghosa says here, 'sabba-santharin' ti yathâ
sabba*m* santhata*m* yeva. (S. V. fol. *t*e.)

2\. The following sentences contain a synopsis of what was merely the
elementary righteousness, the Âdi-brahma-*k*ariya*m*, quite distinct
from, and not for a moment to be compared in glory with the
Magga-brahma-*k*ariya*m*, the system developed in the Noble Eightfold
Path. It will have been seen above, § 11, that the latter, to be
perfect, must be untarnished by the attraction of the hope of heaven or
the fear of hell.\]

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

he enters shyly and confused; fourthly, he is full of anxiety when he
dies; and lastly, on the dissolution of the body, after death, he is
reborn into some unhappy state of suffering or woe\[1\]. This, O
householders, is the fivefold loss of the evil-doer!'

24\. 'Fivefold, O householders, is the gain of the well-doer through his
practice of rectitude. In the first place the well-doer, strong in
rectitude, acquires great wealth through his industry; in the next
place, good reports of him are spread abroad; thirdly, whatever society
he enters--whether of nobles, Brâhmans, heads of houses, or members of
the order--he enters confident and self-possessed; fourthly, he dies
without anxiety; and lastly, on the dissolution of the body, after
death, he is reborn into some happy state in heaven. This, O
householders, is the fivefold gain of the well-doer.'

25\. When the Blessed One had thus taught the disciples, and incited
them, and roused them, and gladdened them, far into the night with
religious discourse, he dismissed them, saying, 'The night is far spent,
O householders. It is time for you to do what you deem most fit.' 'Even
so, Lord!' answered the disciples of Pâ*t*aligâma, and they rose from
their seats, and bowing to the Blessed One, and keeping him on their
right hand as they passed him, they departed thence.

And the Blessed One, not long after the disciples

\[1. Four such states are mentioned, apâya, duggati, vinipâto, and
nirayo, all of which are temporary states. The first three seem to be
synonyms. The last is one of the four divisions into which the first is
usually divided, and is often translated hell; but not being an eternal
state, and not being dependent or consequent upon any judgment, it
cannot accurately be so rendered.\]

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

of Pâ*t*aligâma had departed thence, entered into his private chamber.

26\. At that time Sunîdha and Vassakâra, the chief ministers of Magadha,
were building a fortress at Pâ*t*aligâma to repel the Va*gg*ians, and
there were a number of fairies who haunted in thousands the plots of
ground there. Now, wherever ground is so occupied by powerful fairies,
they bend the hearts of the most powerful kings and ministers to build
dwelling-places there, and fairies of middling and inferior power bend
in a similar way the hearts of middling or inferior kings and ministers.

27\. And the Blessed One, with his great and clear vision, surpassing
that of ordinary men, saw thousands of those fairies haunting
Pâ*t*aligâma. And he rose up very early in the morning, and said to
Ânanda: 'Who is it then, Ânanda, who is building a fortress at
Pâ*t*aligâma?

'Sunîdha and Vassakâra, Lord, the chief ministers of Magadha, are
building a fortress there to keep back the Va*gg*ians.'

28\. They act, Ânanda, as if they had consulted with the Tâvati*m*sa,
angels. \[And telling him of what he had seen, and of the influence such
fairies had, he added\]: 'And among famous places of residence and
haunts of busy men, this will become the chief, the city of
Pâ*t*ali-putta, a centre for the interchange of all kinds of wares. But
three dangers will hang over Pâ*t*ali-putta, that of fire, that of
water, and that of dissension\[1\].'

\[1. This paragraph is of importance to the orthodox Buddhist as proving
the Buddha's power of prophecy and the authority of the {footnote p. 19}
Buddhist scriptures. To those who conclude that such a passage must have
been written after the event that is prophesied, it is valuable evidence
of the age both of the Mahâ Vagga and of the Mahâparinibbâna
Sutta;--evidence, however, that cannot as yet be applied to its full
extent, as the time at which Pâ*t*ali-gâma had grown into the great and
important city of Pâ*t*ali-putta is not as yet known with sufficient
certainty. The late Burmese tradition on this point given in Bigandet's
Legend of the Burmese Buddha, vol. ii, p. 183, can scarcely be depended
upon, though it doubtless rests on older documents, and is mentioned
also by Hiouen Thsang.

The curious popular belief as to good and bad fairies haunting the sites
of houses gave rise to a quack science, akin to astrology, called
vatthu-vi*gg*â, which Buddhaghosa explains here at some length, and
which is frequently condemned elsewhere in the Pâli Pi*t*akas. See, for
instance, § 1 of the Mahâ-sîla*m*, translated below in the Tevi*gg*a
Sutta. The belief is turned to ridicule in the edifying legend, No. 40,
in my 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' pp. 326-334.\]

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

29\. Now Sunîdha and Vassakâra, the chief ministers of Magadha,
proceeded to the place where the Blessed One was. And when they had come
there they exchanged with the Blessed One the greetings and compliments
of friendship and civility, and stood there respectfully on one side.
And, so standing, Sunîdha and Vassakâra, the chief ministers of Magadha,
spake thus to the Blessed One:

'May the venerable Gotama do us the honour of taking his meal, together
with the company of the brethren, at our house to-day.' And the Blessed
One signified, by silence, his consent.

30\. Then when Sunîdha and Vassakâra, the chief ministers of Magadha,
perceived that he had given his consent, they returned to the place
where they dwelt. And on arriving there, they prepared sweet dishes of
boiled rice, and cakes; and informed the Blessed One, saying:

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

'The hour of food has come, O Gotama, and all is ready.'

And the Blessed One robed himself early, took his bowl with him, and
repaired with the brethren to the dwelling-place of Sunîdha and
Vassakâra, and sat down on the seat prepared for him. And with their own
hands they set the sweet rice and the cakes before the brethren with the
Buddha at their head, and waited on them till they had had enough. And
when the Blessed One had finished eating his meal, the ministers brought
a low seat, and sat down respectfully at his side.

31\. And when they were thus seated the Blessed One gave thanks in these
verses:--

'Wheresoe'er the prudent man shall take up his abode  
Let him support there good and upright men of self-control.  
Let him give gifts to all such deities as may be there.  
Revered, they will revere him: honoured, they honour him again;  
Are gracious to him as a mother to her own, her only son.  
And the man who has the grace of the gods, good fortune he
beholds\[1\].'

\[1. This passage gives Buddhaghosa a good deal of difficulty, as it
apparently inculcates offerings to the gods, which is contrary not only
to both the letter and spirit of Buddhism, but also to the practice of
Buddhists. He explains away the gifts to the deities by saying they are
gifts of merit only (patti)--the giver giving the four necessaries to
Bhikkhus, and then expressing a wish that the Devatâs should share in
his pu*ññ*a. I am inclined to think, on the authority of the Deva-dhamma
*G*âtaka (No. 9 in 'Buddhist {footnote p. 21} Birth Stories'), that by
the deities are here meant the good and upright men of self-control,'
mentioned in the previous clause. The verses were perhaps originally
non-Buddhistic.\]

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

32\. And when he had thanked the ministers in these verses he rose from
his seat and departed thence. And they followed him as he went, saying,
'The gate the Sama*n*a Gotama goes out by to-day shall be called
Gotama's gate, and the ferry at which he crosses the river shall be
called Gotama's ferry.' And the gate he went out at was called Gotama's
gate.

------------------------

33\. But the Blessed One went on to the river. And at that time the
river Ganges was brimful and overflowing\[1\]; and wishing to cross to
the opposite bank, some began to seek for boats, some for rafts of wood,
while some made rafts of basket-work\[2\]. Then the Blessed One as
instantaneously as a strong man would stretch forth his arm, or draw it
back again when he had stretched it forth, vanished from this side of
the river, and stood on the further bank with the company of the
brethren.

34\. And the Blessed One beheld the people looking for boats and rafts,
and as he beheld them he brake forth at that time into this song:--

'They who cross the ocean drear  
Making a solid path across the pools--

\[1. Samatittikâ kâkapeyyâ. See the note on Tevi*gg*a Sutta I, 19,
translated below, where the same expression occurs.

2\. Ulumpan ti pâra*m* gamanatthâya â*n*iyo ko*tt*etvâ kata*m*; kullan
ti valli-âdîhi bandhitvâ katabba*m*, says Buddhaghosa. The spelling
u*l*umpa*m* would correspond better to the Sanskrit form u*d*upa, and
has been chosen by Childers in his dictionary, and by Oldenberg in his
transliteration of this passage (Mahâ Vagga VI, 28: 11, 12).\]

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

Whilst the vain world ties its basket rafts-  
These are the wise, these are the saved indeed\[1\]!'

------------------------

End of the First Portion for Recitation.

\[1. That is, those who cross the 'ocean drear' of ta*n*hâ, or craving;
avoiding, by means of the 'dyke' or causeway of the Noble Path, the
'pools' or shallows of lust, and ignorance, and delusion (comp. Dhp. v.
91), whilst the vain world looks for salvation from rites, and
ceremonies, and gods,--'these are the wise, these are the saved indeed!'

How the metre of the verses in the text fell into the confusion in which
it at present stands is not easy to see. One would expect--

Ye visa*gg*a pallalâni taranti a*nn*ava*m* sara*m*  
Kulla*m* hi *g*ano bandhati ti*nn*â medhâvino *g*anâ.

That a gloss can creep into the text, even in verses, is clear from the
indisputable instance at *G*âtaka II, 3 5; and the words setu*m* katvâna
would have been a very natural gloss had the passage once stood as
above. Then supposing that a copyist or reciter had found the words ye
visa*gg*a pallalâni setu*m* katvâna taranti a*nn*ava*m* *s*ara*m*, he
might have corrected, as he thought, the order of the words so as to
avoid any possibility of the words being taken to mean that the setu,
the solid causeway, was made over the a*nn*ava*m* sara*m*, the vastly
deep, which would be palpably absurd. Buddhaghosa found setu*m* katvâna
in the text, but it is not possible to tell in what order he found the
words. The Turnour MS. of the Sumangala Vilâsinî has pabandhati, but a
Ceylon copy of the Samanta Pâsâdikâ confirms the Burmese reading
bandhati at Mahâ Vagga VI, 28, 13. I need scarcely say that the
translation follows the printed text. We know too little about the
history of the Pâli Suttas to be able to do more than make a passing
note of such curiosities.

On vanishing away from a place, comp. below, III, 22.\]

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

### CHAPTER II.

Now the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ânanda, and said: 'Come,
Ânanda, let us go on to Ko*t*igâma.'

'So be it, Lord!' said Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed One.

The Blessed One proceeded with a great company of the brethren to
Ko*t*igâma; and there he stayed in the village itself\[1\].

2\. And at that place the Blessed One addressed the brethren, and said
'It is through not understanding and grasping four Noble Truths, O
brethren, that we have had to run so long, to wander so long in this
weary path of transmigration, both you and I!'

'And what are these four?'

'The noble truth about sorrow; the noble truth about the cause of
sorrow; the noble truth about the cessation of sorrow; and the noble
truth about the path that leads to that cessation. But when these noble
truths are grasped and known the craving for existence is rooted out,
that which leads to renewed existence is destroyed, and then there is no
more birth!'

3\. Thus spake the Blessed One; and when the Happy One had thus spoken,
then again the Teacher said:

\[1. As will be observed from the similar passages that follow, there is
a regular sequence of clauses in the set descriptions of the Buddha's
movements. The last clause should specify the particular grove or house
where the Blessed One stayed; but it is also (in this and one or two
other cases) inserted with due regularity even when it adds nothing
positive to the sense.\]

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

'BY not seeing the four Noble Truths as they really are,  
Long is the path that is traversed through many a birth;  
When these are grasped, the cause of birth is then removed,  
The root of sorrow rooted out, and there is no more birth.'

------------------------

4\. There too, while staying at Ko*t*igâma, the Blessed One held that
comprehensive religious discourse with the brethren on the nature of
upright conduct, and of earnest contemplation, and of intelligence.
'Great is the fruit, great the advantage of earnest contemplation when
set round with upright conduct. Great is the fruit, great the advantage
of intellect when set round with earnest contemplation. The mind set
round with intelligence is freed from the great evils,--that is to say,
from sensuality, from individuality, from delusion, and from ignorance.'

------------------------

5\. Now When the Blessed One had remained as long as was convenient at
Ko*t*igâma, he addressed the venerable Ânanda, and said: 'Come, Ânanda,
let us go on to the villages of Nâdika.'

'So be it, Lord!' said Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed One.

And the Blessed proceeded to the villages of Nâdika with a great company
of the brethren; and there, at Nâdika, the Blessed One stayed at the
Brick Hall\[1\].

\[1. At first Nâdika is (twice) spoken of in the plural number; but
then, thirdly, in the last clause, in the singular. Buddhaghosa
{footnote p. 25} explains this by saying that there were two villages of
the same name on the shore of the same piece of water. On the public
resting-place for travellers, which in this instance bore the proud
title of Brick Hall, see 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' pp. 280-285.\]

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

6\. And the venerable Ânanda went to the Blessed One and paid him
reverence and took his seat beside him. And when he was seated, he
addressed the Blessed One, and said: 'The brother named Sâ*lh*a has died
at Nâdika, Lord. Where has he been reborn, and what is his destiny? The
sister named Nandâ has died, Lord, at Nâdika. Where is she reborn, and
what is her destiny?' And in the same terms he enquired concerning the
devout Sudatta, and the devout lady Su*g*âtâ, the devout Kakudha, and
Kâlinga, and Nika*t*a, and Ka*t*issabha, and Tu*tth*a, and Santu*tth*a,
and Bhadda, and Subhadda.

7\. 'The brother named Sâ*lh*a, Ânanda, by the destruction of the great
evils has by himself, and in this world, known and realised and attained
to Arahatship, and to emancipation of heart and to emancipation of mind.
The sister named Nandâ, Ânanda, has, by the complete destruction of the
five bonds that bind people to this world, become an inheritor of the
highest heavens, there to pass entirely away, thence never to return.
The devout Sudatta, Ânanda, by the complete destruction of the three
bonds, and by the reduction to a minimum of lust, hatred, and delusion
has become a Sakadâgâmin, who on his first return to this world will
make an end of sorrow. The devout woman Su*g*âtâ, Ânanda, by the
complete destruction of the three bonds, has become converted, is no
longer liable to be reborn in a state of suffering, and is assured of
final

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

salvation\[1\]. The devout Kakudha, Ânanda, by the complete destruction
of the five bonds that bind people to these lower worlds of lust, has
become an inheritor of the highest heavens, there to pass entirely away,
thence never to return. So also is the case with Kâlinga, Nika*t*a,
Ka*t*issabha, Tu*tth*a, Santu*tth*a, Bhadda, and Subhadda, and with more
than fifty, devout men of Nâdika. More than ninety devout men of Nâdika,
who have died, Ânanda, have by the complete destruction of the three
bonds, and by the reduction of lust, hatred, and delusion, become
Sakadâgâmins, who on their first return to this world will make an end
of sorrow. More than five hundred devout men of Nâdika who have died.
Ânanda, have by the complete destruction of the three bonds become
converted, are no longer liable to be reborn in a state of suffering,
and are assured of final salvation.

8\. 'Now there is nothing strange in this, Ânanda, that a human being
should die, but that as each one does so you should come to the Buddha,
and enquire about them in this manner, that is wearisome to the Buddha.
I will, therefore, teach you a way of truth, called the Mirror of Truth,
which if an elect disciple possess he may himself predict of himself,
"Hell is destroyed for me, and rebirth as an animal, or a ghost, or in
any place of woe. I am converted, I am no longer liable to be reborn in
a state of suffering, and am assured of final salvation."

9\. 'What then, Ânanda, is this mirror of truth? It is the consciousness
that the elect disciple is in this world possessed of faith in the
Buddha--

\[1. See 'Buddhism,' pp. 108-110, and below, VI, 9.\]

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

believing the Blessed One to be the Holy One, the Fully-enlightened One,
Wise, Upright, Happy, World-knowing, Supreme, the Bridler of men's
wayward hearts, the Teacher of gods and men, the Blessed Buddha. And
that he (the disciple) is possessed of faith in the Truth--believing the
truth to have been proclaimed by the Blessed One, of advantage in this
world, passing not away, welcoming all, leading to salvation, and to be
attained to by the wise, each one for himself. And that he (the
disciple) is possessed of faith in the Order--believing the multitude of
the disciples of the Blessed One who are walking in the four stages of
the noble eightfold path, the righteous, the upright, the just, the
law-abiding--believing this church of the Buddha to be worthy of honour,
of hospitality, of gifts, and of reverence; to be the supreme sowing
ground of merit for the world; to be possessed of the virtues beloved by
the good, virtues unbroken, intact, unspotted, unblemished, virtues
which make men truly free, virtues which are praised by the wise, are
untarnished by the desire of future life or by the belief in the
efficacy of outward acts, and are conducive to high and holy
thought\[1\].'

10\. 'This, Ânanda, is the way, the mirror of truth, which if an elect
disciple possess he may himself predict of himself: "Hell is destroyed
for me; and rebirth as an animal, or a ghost, or in any place of woe. I
am converted; I am no longer liable to be reborn in a state of
suffering, and am assured of final salvation."'

11\. There, too, at the Brick Hall at Nâdika the

\[1. See above, §I, 11.\]

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

Blessed One addressed to the brethren that comprehensive religious
discourse on the nature of upright conduct, and of earnest
contemplation, and of intelligence.

'Great is the fruit, great the advantage of earnest contemplation when
set round with upright conduct. Great is the fruit, great the advantage
of intellect when set round with earnest contemplation. The mind set
round with intelligence is freed from the great evils, that is to say,
from sensuality, from individuality, from delusion, and from ignorance.'

------------------------

12\. Now when the Blessed One had remained as long as he wished at
Nâdika, he addressed Ânanda, and said: 'Come, Ânanda, let us go on to
Vesâli.'

'So be it, Lord!' said Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed One.

Then the Blessed One proceeded, with a great company of the brethren, to
Vesâli; and there at Vesâli the Blessed One stayed at Ambapâli's grove.

13\. Now there the Blessed One addressed the brethren, and said: 'Let a
brother, O mendicants, be mindful and thoughtful; this is our
instruction to you.'

14\. 'And how does a brother become mindful?'

'Herein, O mendicants, let a brother, as he dwells in the body, so
regard the body that he, being strenuous, thoughtful, and mindful, may,
whilst in the world, overcome the grief which arises from bodily
craving--while subject to sensations, let him continue so to regard the
sensations that he, being strenuous, thoughtful, and mindful, may,
whilst in the world, overcome the grief arising from the craving--which
follows our sensation-and so also

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

as he thinks or reasons or feels let him overcome the grief which arises
from the craving due to ideas, or reasoning, or feeling.'

15\. 'And how does a brother become thoughtful?'

'He acts, O mendicants, in full presence of mind whatever he may do, in
coming out and coming in, in looking and watching, in bending in his arm
or stretching it forth, in wearing his robes or carrying his bowl, in
eating and drinking, in consuming or tasting, in walking or standing or
sitting, in sleeping or waking, in talking and in being silent.

'Thus let a brother, O mendicants, be mindful and thoughtful; this is
our instruction to you\[1\].'

\[1. This doctrine of being 'mindful and thoughtful'--sato
sampa*g*âno--is one of the lessons most frequently inculcated in the
Pâli Pi*t*akas, and is one of the 'Seven jewels of the Law.' It is fully
treated of in each of the Nikâyas, forming the subject of the Mahâ
Satipa*tth*âna Sutta in the Dîgha Nikâya, and the Satipa*tth*âna Sutta
of the Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya, and the Satipa*tth*âna Vaggo of the Sa*m*yutta
Nikâya, as well as of various passages in the A<u>n</u>guttara Nikâya
and of the work called Vibha<u>n</u>ga in the Abhidhamma Pi*t*aka. I am
glad to learn that Dr. Morris intends to collect and compare all these
passages in his forthcoming work on the 'Seven jewels of the Law.' These
sections of the Mahâparinibbâna Sutta and the treatment in the
Vibha<u>n</u>ga have preserved, in Dr. Morris's opinion, the oldest form
of the doctrine. Compare Chap. II, § 34.

Buddhaghosa has no comment here on the subject itself, reserving what he
has to say for the comment on the Suttas devoted entirely to it; but he
observes in passing that the reason why the Blessed One laid stress, at
this particular time and place, on the necessity of being 'mindful and
thoughtful,' was because of the imminent approach of the beautiful
courtezan in whose grove they were staying. The use of the phrase sati
upa*tth*âpetabbâ below, Chap. V, § 13 (text. p. 51), in reference to the
way in which women should be treated, is quite in accordance with this
explanation. But see the next note.\]

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

16\. \[1\] Now the courtezan Ambapâli heard that the Blessed One had
arrived at Vesâli, and was staying at her mango grove. And ordering a
number of magnificent vehicles to be made ready, she mounted one of
them, and proceeded with her train towards her garden. She went in the
carriage as far as the ground was passable for carriages; there she
alighted; and she proceeded on foot to the place where the Blessed One
was, and took her seat respectfully on one side. And when she was thus
seated the Blessed One instructed, aroused, incited, and gladdened her
with religious discourse.

17\. Then she--instructed, aroused, incited, and gladdened with his
words--addressed the Blessed One, and said:

'May the Blessed One do me the honour of taking his meal, together with
the brethren, at my house to-morrow.'

And the Blessed One gave, by silence, his consent. Then when Ambapâli
the courtezan saw that the Blessed One had consented, she rose from her
seat and bowed down before him, and keeping him on her right hand as she
past him, she departed thence.

\[1. From this point down to the words 'he rose from his seat,' in § II,
24, is, with a few unimportant variations, word for word the same as
Mahâ Vagga VI, 30, 1, to VI, 30, 6. But the passage there follows
immediately after the verses translated above, § I, 34, so that the
events here (in §§ 16-22) localised at Vesâli, are there localised at
Ko*t*igâma. Our section II, 5 is then inserted between our sections II,
22 and II, 23; and our section II, 12 does not occur at all, the Blessed
One only reaching Ambapâli's grove when he goes there (as in our section
II, 23) to partake of the meal to which he had been invited. Buddhaghosa
passes over this discrepancy in silence.\]

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

18\. Now the Li*kkh*avis of Vesâli heard that the Blessed One had
arrived at Vesâli, and was staying at Ambapâli's grove. And ordering a
number of magnificent carriages to be made ready, they mounted one of
them and proceeded with their train to Vesâli. Some of them were dark,
dark in colour, and wearing dark clothes and ornaments: some of them
were fair, fair in colour, and wearing light clothes and ornaments: some
of them were red, ruddy in colour, and wearing red clothes and
ornaments: some of them were white, pale in colour, and wearing white
clothes and ornaments.

19\. And Ambapâli drove up against the young Likkhavis, axle to axle,
wheel to wheel, and yoke to yoke, and the Likkhavis said to Ambapâli the
courtezan, 'How is it, Ambapâli, that thou drivest up against us thus?'

'My Lords, I have just invited the Blessed One and his brethren for
their morrow's meal,' said she.

'Ambapâli! give up this meal to us for a hundred thousand,' said they.

'My Lords, were you to offer all Vesâli with its subject territory', I
would not give up so honourable a feast!'

Then the Likkhavis cast up their hands\[2\], exclaiming, 'We are outdone
by this mango girl! we are out-reached by this mango girl\[3\]!' and
they went on to Ambapâli's grove.

20\. When the Blessed One saw the Likkhavis

\[1. Sahâran ti sa-*g*anapadan. (S. V. *t*au.)

2\. A<u>n</u>gulî po*th*esu*m*. Childers translates this phrase 'to snap
the fingers as a token of pleasure;' but Buddhaghosa says, a<u>n</u>gulî
po*th*esun ti a<u>n</u>gulî *k*âlesum. (S. V. *t*au.)

3\. Ambapâli means mango grower, one who looks after mangoes.\]

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

approaching in the distance, he addressed the brethren, and said:

'O brethren, let those of the brethren who have never seen the
Tâvati*m*sa gods, gaze upon this company of the Li*kkh*avis, behold this
company of the Li*kkh*avis, compare this company of the
Li*kkh*avis--even as a company of Tâvati*m*sa gods\[1\].'

21\. And when they had ridden as far as the ground was passable for
carriages, the Li*kkh*avis alighted there, and then went on on foot to
the place where the Blessed One was, and took their seats respectfully
by his side. And when they were thus seated the Blessed One instructed
and roused and incited and gladdened them with religious discourse\[2\].

22\. Then they instructed and roused and incited and gladdened with his
words, addressed the Blessed One, and said, 'May the Blessed One do us
the honour of taking his meal, together with the brethren, at our house
to-morrow?'

'O Li*kkh*avis, I have promised to dine to-morrow with Ambapâli the
courtezan,' was the reply.

\[1. The Tâvati*m*sa-devâ are the gods in the heaven of the Great
Thirty-Three, the principal deities of the Vedic Pantheon. Buddhaghosa
says, 'Ima*m* Li*kkh*avi-parisa*m* tumhâka*m* *k*ittena
Tâvati*m*sa-parisa*m* upasa*m*haratha upanetha alliyâpetha: Yath' eva hi
Tâvati*m*sâ abhirûpa pâsâdikâ nîlâdi-nâna-va*nn*â eva*ñ* *k'* ime
Li*kkh*avi-râ*g*âno pîti. Tâvati*m*sehi samake katvâ passathâ ti attho.'

2 The Mâlâla<u>n</u>kâra-vatthu gives the substance of the discourse on
this occasion. 'The princes had come in their finest and richest dress;
in their appearance they vied in beauty with the nats (or angels). But
foreseeing the ruin and misery that was soon to come upon them all, the
Buddha exhorted his disciples to entertain a thorough contempt for
things that are dazzling to the eyes, but essentially perishable and
unreal in their nature.'--Bigandet, 2nd ed. p. 260.\]

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

Then the Li*kkh*avis cast up their hands, exclaiming, 'We are outdone by
this mango girl! we are outreached by this mango girl!' And expressing
their thanks and approval of the words of the Blessed One, they rose
from their seats and bowed down before the Blessed One, and keeping him
on their right hand as they past him, they departed thence.

23\. And at the end of the night Ambapâli the courtezan made ready in
her mansion sweet rice and cakes, and announced the time to the Blessed
One, saying, 'The hour, Lord, has come, and the meal is ready!'

And the Blessed One robed himself early in the morning, and took his
bowl, and went with the brethren to the place where Ambapâli's dwelling
house was: and when he had come there he seated himself on the seat
prepared for him. And Ambapâli the courtezan set the sweet rice and
cakes before the order, with the Buddha at their head, and waited upon
them till they refused any more.

24\. And when the Blessed One had quite finished his meal, the courtezan
had a low stool brought, and sat down at his side, and addressed the
Blessed One, and said: 'Lord, I present this mansion to the order of
mendicants, of which the Buddha is the chief.' And the Blessed One
accepted the gift; and after instructing, and rousing, and inciting, and
gladdening her with religious discourse, he rose from his seat and
departed thence\[1\].

\[1. Bishop Bigandet says: 'In recording the conversion of a courtezan
named Apapalika, her liberality and gifts to Budha and his disciples,
and the preference designedly given to her over princes and nobles, who,
humanely speaking, seemed in every respect better entitled to
attentions--one is almost reminded of {footnote p. 34} the conversion of
"a woman that was a sinner," mentioned in the Gospels' (Legend of the
Burmese Budha, 2nd ed. p. 258).\]

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

25\. While at Ambapâli's mango grove the Blessed One held that
comprehensive religious discourse with the disciples on the nature of
upright conduct, and of earnest contemplation, and of intelligence.

'Great is the fruit, great the advantage of earnest contemplation when
set round with upright conduct. Great is the fruit, great the advantage
of intellect when set round with earnest contemplation. The mind set
round with intelligence is freed from the great evils, that is to say,
from sensuality, from individuality, from delusion, and from ignorance.'

------------------------

26\. Now when the Blessed One had remained as long as he wished at
Ambapâli's grove, he addressed Ânanda, and said: 'Come, Ânanda, let us
go on to Beluva\[1\].'

'So be it, Lord,' said Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed One.

Then the Blessed One proceeded, with a great company of the brethren, to
Beluva, and there the Blessed One stayed in the village itself.

------------------------

27\. Now the Blessed One there addressed the brethren, and said: 'O
mendicants, do you take up your abode round about Vesâli, each according
to the place where his friends, intimates, and close companions may
live, for the rainy season of vassa. I shall enter upon the rainy season
here at Beluva.'

\[1. Beluva-gâmako ti Vesâli-samîpe pâda-gâmako, 'a village on a slope
at the foot of a hill near Vesâli,' says Buddhaghosa. (S. V. *t*au.)\]

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

So be it, Lord!' said those brethren, in assent, to the Blessed One. And
they entered upon the rainy season round about Vesâli, each according to
the place where his friends or intimates or close companions lived:
whilst the Blessed One stayed even there at Beluva.

------------------------

28\. Now when the Blessed One had thus entered upon the rainy season,
there fell upon him a dire sickness, and sharp pains came upon him, even
unto death. But the Blessed One, mindful and self-possessed, bore them
without complaint.

29\. Then this thought occurred to the Blessed One, 'It would not be
right for me to pass away from existence without addressing the
disciples, without taking leave of the order. Let me now, by a strong
effort of the will, bend this sickness down again, and keep my hold on
life till the allotted time be come\[1\].'

30\. And the Blessed One, by a strong effort of the will, bent that
sickness down again, and kept his hold on life till the time he fixed
upon should come. And the sickness abated upon him.

------------------------

31\. Now very soon after the Blessed One began to recover; when he had
quite got rid of the sickness, he went out from the monastery, and sat
down behind the monastery on a seat spread out there. And the venerable
Ânanda went to the place where the Blessed One was, and saluted him, and
took a seat respectfully on one side, and addressed the

\[1. The commentary on *g*îvita-sa<u>n</u>khâra*m* adhitthâya vihareyyan
is not quite clear, but the general meaning of the words cannot be very
different from the version given in the text.\]

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span> Blessed One, and said: 'I have beheld,
Lord, how the Blessed One was in health, and I have beheld how the
Blessed One had to suffer. And though at the sight of the sickness of
the Blessed One my body became weak as a creeper, and the horizon became
dim to me, and my faculties were no longer clear\[1\], yet
notwithstanding I took some little comfort from the thought that the
Blessed One would not pass away from existence until at least he had
left instructions as touching the order.'

32\. 'What, then, Ânanda? Does the order expect that of me? I have
preached the truth without making any distinction between exoteric and
esoteric doctrine: for in respect of the truths, Ânanda, the Tathâgata
has no such thing as the closed fist of a teacher, who keeps some things
back\[2\]. Surely, Ânanda, should there be any one who harbours the
thought, "It is I who will lead the brotherhood," or, "The order is
dependent upon me," it is he who

should lay down instructions in any matter concerning the order. Now the
Tathâgata, Ânanda, thinks not that it is he who should lead the
brotherhood, or that the order is dependent upon him. Why then should he
leave instructions in any matter concerning the order? I too, O Ânanda,
am now grown old, and full of years, my journey is drawing to its close,
I have reached my sum of days, I am turning eighty years of age; and
just as a worn-out cart, Ânanda, can only with much additional care be
made to move along, so, methinks, the body of the Tathâgata can only be
kept going with much additional care\[1\]. It is only, Ânanda, when

\[1. Vegha-missakena, the meaning of which is not clear. The
Mâlâla<u>n</u>kâra-vatthu, as rendered by Bigandet, has 'repairs.' The
Sumangala Vilâsinî says, Veghamissakenâ ti
bâha-bandhana*k*akka-bandhanâdinâ pa*t*isa<u>n</u>khara*n*ena
veghamissakena; thus giving the same meaning, but in such a way as to
throw no light on the derivation of the word. The whole episode from §
II, 27 to the end of the chapter occurs also word for word in the
Satipa*tth*âna Vagga of the Samyutta Nikâya, and the Burmese Phayre MS.
there reads vekhamissakena, as the Burmese MS. does here. My Dîgha
Nikâya confirms Childers's reading, which no doubt correctly represents
the uniform tradition of the Ceylon MSS. The Sumangala Vilâsinî goes on,
ma*ññ*e ti *g*ara-saka*t*a*m* viya meghamissakena ma*ññ*e yâpeti
arahatta-phalaveghanena *k*atu-iriyâpatha-kappana*m* Tathâgatassa hoti
nidasseti. Here the reading megha of the Turnour MS. must be a copyist's
slip of the pen for vegha, and veghanena is no clearer than
veghamissakena. On the use of the word missaka at the end of a compound
see *G*âtaka II, 8, 420, 433. I have translated on what seems to me the
only solution at present possible, namely, that an initial *a* has been
dropt, and that veghâ or vekhâ = avekshâ, 'attention, foresight, care.'
In the same way though avala*ñg*eti does occur (*G*âtaka I, 111), the
more usual form in Pâli, and the only one given by Childers, is
vala*ñg*eti.\]

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

the Tathâgata, ceasing to attend to any outward thing, or to experience
any sensation, becomes plunged in that devout meditation of heart which
is concerned with no material object--it is only then that the body of
the Tathâgata is at ease.

33\. 'Therefore, O Ânanda, be ye lamps unto yourselves. Be ye a refuge
to yourselves. Betake yourselves to no external refuge. Hold fast to the
truth as a lamp. Hold fast as a refuge to the truth. Look not for refuge
to any one besides yourselves. And how, Ânanda, is a brother to be a
lamp unto himself, a refuge to himself, betaking himself to no external
refuge, holding fast to the truth as a lamp, holding fast as a refuge to
the truth, looking not for refuge to any one besides himself?

34\. 'Herein, O Ânanda, let a brother, as he dwells in the body, so
regard the body that he, being strenuous, thoughtful, and mindful, may,
whilst in the world, overcome the grief which arises from bodily
craving--while subject to sensations let him continue so to regard the
sensations that he, being strenuous, thoughtful, and mindful, may,
whilst in the world, overcome the grief which arises from the
sensations--and so, also, as he thinks, or reasons, or feels, let him
overcome the grief which arises from the craving due to ideas, or to
reasoning, or to feeling.

35\. 'And whosoever, Ânanda, either now or after I am dead, shall be a
lamp unto themselves, and a refuge unto themselves, shall betake
themselves to no external refuge, but holding fast to the truth as their
lamp, and holding fast as their refuge to the truth, shall look not for
refuge to any one besides themselves--it is they, Ânanda, among my

bhikkhus, who shall reach the very topmost Height!-but they must be
anxious to learn\[1\].'

End of the Second Portion for Recitation.

\[1. Tamatagge me te Ânanda bhikkhûbhavissanti yeke*k*i sikkhâkâmâ. The
Burmese MSS. for me te read p'ete, which is a little easier. Buddhaghosa
says, Tamatagge ti tamagge. Ma*ggh*e takâro padasandhivasena vutto.

for tamagge. The t in the middle is used for euphony. This word means,
"these are the most pre-eminent, the very chief." Having, as above
stated, broken every bond of darkness (tama) those bhikkhus of mine,
Ânanda, will be at the very top, in the highest condition. They will be
at the very top of whom? Those bhikkhus who are willing to learn, and
those who exercise themselves in the four ways of being mindful and
thoughtful, they shall be at the top of all (the rest). Thus does he
make Arahatship the three-peaked height of his discourse' (compare on
this last phrase Nibbânena desanâkû*t*a*m* ga*n*hati, *G*âtaka I, 275,
393, 401; and see also I, 114). Uttama, the highest (scil. bhâva,
condition), is used absolutely of Arahatship or Nirvâ*n*a at *G*âtaka I,
96; Aggaphala occurs in the same sense at *G*âtaka I, 114; and even
Phalagga at Mah. 102. The last words, 'but they must be anxious to
learn,' seem to me to be an after thought. It is only those who are
thoroughly determined to work out their own salvation, without looking
for safety to any one else, even to the Buddha himself, who will, whilst
in the world, enter into and experience Nirvâ*n*a. But, of course, let
there be no mistake, merely to reject the vain baubles of the current
superstitious beliefs is not enough. There is plenty to learn and to
acquire, of which enough discourse is elsewhere. For aggamâ in the
comment we must read aggatamâ. If one could read amatagge in the text,
all difficulty would vanish; but this would be too bold, and neither do
I see how the use of anamatagge can help us.\]

### CHAPTER III.

1<sup>\[1\]</sup>. Now the Blessed One robed himself early in the
morning, and taking his bowl in the robe, went into Vesâli for alms, and
when he returned he sat down on the seat prepared for him, and after he
had finished eating the rice he addressed the venerable Ânanda, and
said: 'Take up the mat, Ânanda; I will go to spend the day at the
*K*âpâla *K*etiya.'

'So be it, Lord!' said the venerable Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed
One. And taking up the mat he followed step for step behind the Blessed
One.

2\. So the Blessed One proceeded to the *K*âpâla *K*etiya, and when he
had come there he sat down on the mat spread out for him, and the
venerable Ânanda took his seat respectfully beside him. Then the Blessed
One addressed the venerable Ânanda, and said: 'How delightful a spot,
Ânanda, is Vesâli, and the Udena *K*etiya, and the Gotamaka *K*etiya,
and the Sattambaka *K*etiya, and the Bahuputta *K*etiya, and the
Sârandada *K*etiya, and the *K*âpâla *K*etiya.

3\. 'Ânanda! whosoever has thought out, developed, practised,
accumulated, and ascended to the very heights of the four paths to
Iddhi\[2\], and so

\[1. The whole of this passage down to the end of § 10 recurs in the
Iddhipâda Vagga of the Samyutta Nikâya.

2\. Iddhi. The four paths are, 1. Will, 2. effort, 3. thought, and 4.
investigation, each united to earnest thought and the struggle against
sin. The Iddhi reached by them is supposed in works on Buddhism to be a
bodily condition (power of flying, &c.), by which the body rose superior
to all the ordinary limitations of {footnote p. 41} matter--a bodily
condition corresponding to the mental condition of exaltation and power
by which it was reached. On this curiously perverted exaggeration of the
real influence of the mind over the body see, further, the translator's
Buddhism,' pp. 174-17 7. Two of the string of participles--yânikatâ,
which may possibly mean 'made use of as a vehicle,' and susamâraddhâ,
'most thoroughly ascended up to'--might seem to allude to Iddhi as a
power of flying bodily through the air. But the whole set of participles
is used elsewhere of conditions of mind highly esteemed among the
Buddhists, and incapable of giving support to any such allusion. So, for
instance, of universal love (mettâ) at *G*âtaka II, 61.\]

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

mastered them as to be able to use them as a means of (mental)
advancement, and as a basis for edification, he, should he desire it,
could remain in the same birth for a kalpa, or for that portion of the
kalpa which had yet to run. Now the Tathâgata has thought them out, and
thoroughly practised and developed them \[in all respects as just more
fully described\], and he could, therefore, should he desire it, live on
yet for a kalpa, or for that portion of the kalpa which has yet to run.'

4\. But even though a suggestion so evident and a hint so clear were
thus given by the Blessed One, the venerable Ânanda was incapable of
comprehending them; and he besought not the Blessed One, saying,
'Vouchsafe, Lord, to remain during the kalpa! Live on through the kalpa,
O Blessed One! for the good and the happiness of the great multitudes,
out of pity for the world, for the good and the gain and the weal of
gods and men!' So far was his heart possessed by the Evil One\[1\].

\[1. Yathâ ta*m* Mârena pariyu*tth*ita*k*itto. Here ta*m* is the
indeclinable particle, yathâ ta*m* introducing an explanation. My MS. of
the Dîgha Nikâya and the Turnour MS. of the Sumangala Vilasinî read
pari*v*u*tth*ita, and either spelling is correct. The {footnote p. 42}
fact is that the *y* or *v* in such cases is even less than euphonic; it
is an assistance not to the speaker, but merely to the writer. Thus in
the Si*ñ*halese duwanawâ, 'to run,' the spoken word is duanawâ, and the
*w* is written only to avoid the awkward use in the middle of a word of
the initial sign for the sound *a*. That the speakers of Pâli found no
difficulty in pronouncing two vowels together is abundantly proved by
numerous instances. The writers of Pâli, in those cases in which the
second vowel begins a word, use without hesitation the initial sign; but
in the middle of the word this would be so ungainly that they naturally
prefer to insert a consonantal sign to carry the vowel sign. The varying
readings I have pointed out are a strong confirmation of the correctness
of the pronunciation of modern native scholars; and we may the more
readily adopt it as the question is not really one concerning the
pronunciation of Pâli, but concerning the use which modern native
copyists make of their own alphabet. I would pronounce therefore
pari-u*tth*ita-*k*itto.\]

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

5\. A second and a third time did the Blessed One \[say the same thing,
and a second and a third time was Ânanda's heart thus hardened\].

6\. Now the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ânanda and said: 'You
may leave me, Ânanda, awhile, and do whatever seemeth to thee fit.'

'So be it, Lord!' said the venerable Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed,
and rising from his seat he saluted the Blessed One, and passing him on
the right, sat down at the foot of a certain tree not far off thence.

------------------------

7\. Now not long after the venerable Ânanda had been gone, Mâra, the
Evil One, approached the Blessed One, and stood beside him. And so
standing there, he addressed the Blessed One in these words:

'Pass away now, Lord, from existence; let the Blessed One now die. Now
is the time for the Blessed One to pass away--even according to the

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

word which the Blessed One spoke: when he said\[1\]: "I shall not die, O
Evil One! until the brethren and sisters of the order, and until the
lay-disciples of either sex\[2\] shall have become true hearers, wise
and well-trained, ready and learned, versed in the Scriptures,
fulfilling all the greater and the lesser duties, correct in life,
walking according to the precepts--until they, having thus themselves
learned the doctrine, shall be able to tell others of it, preach it,
make it known, establish it, open it, minutely explain it and make it
clear--until they, when others start vain doctrine, shall be able by the
truth to vanquish and refute it, and so to spread the wonderworking
truth abroad!"'

8\. 'And now, Lord, the brethren and sisters of the order and the
lay-disciples of either sex have become \[all this\], are able to do
\[all this\]. Pass away now therefore, Lord, from existence; let the
Blessed One now die! The time has come for the Blessed One to pass
away-even according to the word which he spake when he said, "I shall
not die, O Evil One! until this pure religion of mine shall have become
successful, prosperous, widespread, and popular in all its full
extent--until, in a word, it shall have been well proclaimed to men,"
And now, Lord, this pure religion of thine has become \[all this\]. Pass
away now therefore, Lord, from

\[1. The words here quoted were spoken by the Buddha, after he had been
enjoying the first bliss of Nirvâ*n*a, under the shepherd's Nigrodha
tree (see my 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' pp. 109-111). The Evil One then
also tempted him to die (see below, paragraph III, 43), and this was his
reply.

2\. The whole paragraph is repeated, here and below, for each of these
classes of persons.\]

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

existence; let the Blessed One now die! The time has come for the
Blessed One to pass away!'

9\. And when he had thus spoken, the Blessed One addressed Mâra, the
Evil One, and said: 'O Evil One! make thyself happy, the final
extinction of the Tathâgata shall take place before long. At the end of
three months from this time the Tathâgata will die!'

------------------------

10\. Thus the Blessed One while at the *K*âpâla *K*etiya deliberately
and consciously rejected the rest of his allotted sum of life. And on
his so rejecting, it there arose a mighty earthquake, awful and
terrible, and the thunders of heaven burst forth. And when the Blessed
One beheld this, he broke out at that time into this hymn of exultation:

'His sum of life the sage renounced,  
The cause of life immeasurable or small;  
With inward joy and calm, he broke,  
Like coat of mail, his life's own cause!'

------------------------

11\. Now the following thought occurred to the venerable Ânanda:
'Wonderful indeed and marvellous is it that this mighty earthquake
should arise, awful and terrible, and that the thunders of heaven should
burst forth! What may be the proximate, what the remote cause of the
appearance of this earthquake?'

12\. Then the venerable Ânanda went up to the place where the Blessed
One was, and did obeisance to the Blessed One, and seated himself
respectfully at one side, and said: 'Wonderful indeed and marvellous is
it that this mighty earthquake should arise, awful and terrible, and
that the thunders of

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

heaven should burst forth! What may be the proximate, what the remote
cause of the appearance of this earthquake?'

13\. 'Eight are the proximate, eight the remote causes, Ânanda, for the
appearance of a mighty earthquake. What are the eight? This great earth,
Ânanda, is established on water, the water on wind, and the wind rests
upon space. And at such a time, Ânanda, as the mighty winds blow, the
waters are shaken by the mighty winds as they blow, and by the moving
water the earth is shaken. These are the first causes, proximate and
remote, of the appearance of a mighty earthquake.

14\. 'Again, Ânanda, a Sama*n*a or a Brâhman of great (intellectual)
power, arid who has the feelings of his heart well under his control; or
a god or fairy (devatâ\[1\]) of great might and power,--when such a

\[1. Devatâ is a fairy, god, genius, or angel. I am at a loss how to
render this word without conveying an erroneous impression to those not
familiar with ancient ideas, and specially with ancient Buddhist ideas,
of the spirit world. It includes gods of all sorts; tree and river
nymphs; the kindly fairies or ghosts who haunt houses (see my 'Buddhist
Birth Stories,' Tale No. 40); spirits in the ground (see above, § I,
26); the angels who minister at the great renunciation, the temptation,
and the death of the Buddha; the guardian angels who watch over men, and
towns, and countries; and many other similar beings. 'Celestial being'
would be wholly inapplicable, for instance, to the creatures referred to
in the curious passage above (§ I, 26). 'Superhuman being' would be an
inaccurate rendering; for all these light and airy shapes come below,
and after, man in the Buddhist order of precedence. 'Spirit' being used
of the soul inside the human body, and of the human soul after it has
left the body, and figuratively of mental faculties--none of which are
included under devatâ--would suggest ideas inconsistent with that of the
Pâli word. As there is therefore no appropriate general word I have
chosen, for each passage where the expression occurs, the word used in
English of the special class {footnote p. 46} more particularly referred
to in the passage of the text. Here all kinds of devatâs being referred
to, and there being, no word in English for them all, I have ventured to
put the word devatâ into my version, and to trouble the reader with this
note.\]

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

one by intense meditation of the finite idea of earth or the infinite
idea of water (has succeeded in realising the comparative value of
things\[1\]) he can make this earth move and tremble and be shaken
violently. These are the second causes, proximate or remote, of the
appearance of a mighty earthquake.

15\. 'Again, Ânanda, when a Bodhisatta consciously and deliberately
leaves his temporary form in the heaven of delight and descends into his
mother's womb, then is this earth made to quake and tremble and is
shaken violently. These are the third causes, proximate or remote, of
the appearance of a mighty earthquake\[2\].

\[1. Yassa parittâ pa*th*avi-sa*ññ*a bhâvitâ hoti appamâ*n*â âposa*ññ*â,
on which Buddhaghosa says simply, Parittâ ti dubbalâ: appamâ*n*â ti
balavâ, and then goes on, as a note to kampeti, to tell a long story how
Sangharakkhita Sâma*n*era, the nephew of Nâga Thera, attained Arahatship
on the day of his admission to the order; and at once proceeded to
heaven, and standing on the pinnacle of the palace of the king of the
gods, shook the whole place with his big toe; to the great consternation
and annoyance of the exalted dwellers therein! There is no doubt a real
truth in the idea that deep thought can shake the universe, and make the
palaces of the gods to tremble, just as faith is said in Matthew xxi. 21
to be able to remove mountains, and cause them to be cast into the sea.
But these figurative expressions have, in Buddhism, become a fruitful
soil for the outgrowth of superstitions and misunderstandings; and the
train of early Buddhist speculation in this field has yet to be
elucidated. There is much about it in the Mahâ Padhâna Sutta of the
Dîgha Nikâya, where Chap. III, §§ 11-20 recur.

2\. The Bodhisatta's voluntary incarnation is looked upon by the
Buddhists as a great act of renunciation, and curious legends have
{footnote p. 47} gathered about it. One is that on the night when she
conceived his mother dreamt that a white elephant entered her side. The
account will be found at length in my 'Buddhist Birth Stories' (pp.
62-64), and the earthquake is there mentioned in terms identical with
those in the text. The sacred event is also one of those represented on
the ancient bas-reliefs round the Bharhut Thûpa, a full description of
which will be found in General Cunningham's most interesting work, 'The
Stupa of Bharhut.' General Cunningham says of the description placed
above this sculpture: 'Above it in large characters is inscribed
Bhagavato rûkdanta, which may perhaps be translated, "Buddha as the
sounding elephant," from ru, to sound, to make a particular sort of
sound.' Now the first word of the inscription is in the genitive case,
so that if the second word could mean an elephant, the whole would
signify, 'The Buddha's, elephant.' But the characters which General
Cunningham reads rûkdanta are, I venture to suggest, okkanti (?
ûkkanti); and the inscription simply says, 'The descent of the blessed
One.' As I have pointed out in 'Buddhism' (p. 184), the white elephant
legend is one of those hallowed sun stories by which half-converted
Hindus have striven to embellish the life story of the Teacher whose
followers they had become. In the Lalita Vistara. (Calc. ed. p. 63) the
entrance of the elephant into Mâyâ precedes the dream; but though the
ignorant may have therefore accepted it as a fact, it is of course only
a figure of speech--and I venture to think from the Hindu standpoint, a
beautiful figure of speech--to express the incarnation of divine
mildness and majesty in a human form. The use of such a figure is not
confined to India. In the earliest of the Apocryphal Gospels, the Gospel
according to the Hebrews, the incarnation of the divine gentleness and
love is expressed by saying that a dove from heaven 'entered into' the
human form.\]

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

16\. 'Again, Ânanda, when a Bodhisatta deliberately and consciously
quits his mother's womb, then the earth quakes and trembles and is
shaken violently. This is the fourth cause, proximate and remote, of the
appearance of a mighty earthquake.

17\. 'Again, Ânanda,' when a Tathâgata arrives at the supreme and
perfect enlightenment, then this earth quakes and trembles and is shaken
violently. <span id="page_48">p. 48</span> This is the fifth cause,
proximate and remote, of the appearance of a mighty earthquake.

18\. 'Again, Ânanda, when a Tathâgata founds the sublime kingdom of
righteousness, then this earth quakes and trembles and is shaken
violently. This is the sixth cause, proximate and remote, of the
appearance of a mighty earthquake.

19\. 'Again, Ânanda, when a Tathâgata consciously and deliberately
rejects the remainder of his life, then this earth quakes and trembles
and is shaken violently. This is the seventh cause, proximate and
remote, of the appearance of a mighty earthquake.

20\. 'Again, Ânanda, when a Tathâgata passes entirely away with that
utter passing away in which nothing whatever is left behind, then this
earth quakes and trembles and is shaken violently. This is the eighth
cause, proximate and remote, of the appearance of a mighty earthquake.

------------------------

21\. 'Now of eight kinds, Ânanda, are these assemblies. Which are the
eight\[1\]? Assemblies of nobles, Brâhma*n*as, householders, and
Sama*n*as, and the angel hosts of the Guardian Angels, the Great
Thirty-Three, Mâra, and Brahma.

22\. 'Now I call to mind, Ânanda, how when I used to enter into an
assembly of many hundred nobles, before I had seated myself there or
talked to them or started a conversation with them, I used to become in
colour like unto their colour, and in voice like unto their voice. Then
with religious discourse

\[1. The connection, or rather want of connection, between this and the
last paragraph seems to me to be very suggestive as to the way in which
the Sutta was composed. The narrative is resumed at paragraph III, 43.
On vanishing away, comp. 1, 33.\]

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span> I used to instruct, incite, and quicken
them, and fill them with gladness. But they knew me not when I spoke,
and would say, "Who may this be who thus speaks? a man or a god?" Then
having instructed, incited, quickened, and gladdened them with religious
discourse, I would vanish away. But they knew me not even when I
vanished away; and would say, "Who may this be who has thus vanished
away? a man or a god?"'

23\. \[And in the same words the Blessed One spake of how he had been
used to enter into assemblies of each of the other of the eight kinds,
and of how he had not been made known to them either in speaking or in
vanishing away.\] 'Now these, Ânanda, are the eight assemblies.'

------------------------

24\. 'Now these, Ânanda, are the eight positions of mastery \[over the
delusion arising from the apparent permanence of external
things<sup>\[1\]</sup>\]. What are the eight?

\[1. Abhibhâyatanî ti abhibhavanakâra*n*âni. Ki*m* abhibhavanti?
Pa*kk*anîka-dhamme pi âramma*n*âni pi: tâni hi pa*t*ipakkha-bhâvena
pa*kk*anîka-dhamme abhibhavanti puggalassa *ñ*ânuttaritâya âramma*n*âni,
says Buddhaghosa. (Sum. Vil. *th*î.)

This and the next paragraph are based upon the Buddhist belief as to the
long-vexed question between the Indian schools who represented more or
less closely the European Idealists and Realists. When cleared of the
many repetitions inserted for the benefit of the repeaters or reciters,
the fundamental idea seems to be that the great necessity is to get rid
of the delusion that what one sees and feels is real and permanent.
Nothing is real and permanent but character.

The so-called eight Positions of Mastery are merely an expansion of the
first two of the following eight Stages of Deliverance, and the whole
argument is also expressed in another form in the {footnote p. 50}
passage on the nine successive 'Cessations,' of which an abstract will
be found in Childers, sub voce nirodha.

The two lists have been translated and commented upon by Burnouf (Lotus
de la Bonne Loi, pp. 543, 824-832), who took the texts from the
Mahânidâna Sutta and the Sangîti Sutta respectively. The former has been
reprinted in Grimblot's Sept Suttas Pâlis, where the passage will be
found at pp. 261, 262. I regret that in my interpretation I have been
compelled to differ so greatly from Burnouf. Though I have devoted much
care and time to the subject, I do not suppose that I have understood it
better than he did. We cannot hope to get to the bottom of what these
old Buddhists thought about matter and mind from such curt lists as
these.\]

25\. 'When a man having subjectively the idea of form sees externally
forms which are finite, and pleasant or unpleasant to the sight, and
having mastered them, is conscious that he knows and sees--this is the
first position of mastery.

26\. 'When a man having subjectively the idea of form sees externally
forms which are boundless, and pleasant or unpleasant to the sight, and
having mastered them is conscious that he knows and sees--this is the
second position of mastery.

27\. 'When a man without the subjective idea of form sees externally
forms which are finite, and pleasant or unpleasant to the sight, and
having mastered them, is conscious that he knows and sees--this is the
third position of mastery.

28\. 'When a man without the subjective idea of form sees externally
forms which are boundless, and pleasant or unpleasant to the sight, and
having mastered them, is conscious that he knows and sees--this is the
fourth position of mastery.

29\. 'When a man without the subjective idea of form sees externally
forms that are blue in colour, blue in appearance, and reflecting
blue,--just, for

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

instance, as the Ummâ flower is blue in colour, blue in appearance, and
reflecting blue; or, again, as that fine muslin of Benares which, on
whichever side you look at it, is blue in colour, blue in appearance,
and reflecting blue,--when a man without the subjective idea of form
sees externally forms which, just in that way, are blue, blue in colour,
blue in appearance, and reflecting blue, and having mastered them, is
conscious that he knows and sees-that is the fifth position of mastery.'

.32. \[The sixth, seventh, and eighth positions of mastery are explained
in words identical with those used to explain the fifth; save that
yellow, red, and white are respectively substituted throughout for blue;
and the Ka*n*ikâra flower, the Bandhu-*g*îvaka flower, and the morning
star are respectively substituted for the Ummâ flower, as the first of
the two objects given as examples.\]

33\. 'Now these stages of deliverance, Ânanda \[from the hindrance to
thought arising from the sensations and ideas due to external
forms<sup>\[1\]</sup>\], are eight in number. Which are the eight?

34\. 'A man possessed with the idea of form sees forms--this is the
first stage of deliverance.

35\. 'Without the subjective idea of form, he sees forms externally-this
is the second stage of deliverance.

\[1. These are the A*tth*a Vimokkhâ. Buddhaghosa has no comment upon
them; merely saying, 'The passage on the Vimokkhas is easy to
understand'--which is tantalizing. The last five Vimokkhas occur again
below, in Chap. VI, §§ 11-13, where it is clear that they are used to
express the progress through deep meditation, into absent-mindedness,
abstraction, and being sunk in thought, until finally the thinker falls
into actual trance.\]

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

36\. 'With the thought "it is well," he becomes intent (upon what he
sees)--this is the third stage of deliverance.

37\. 'By passing quite beyond all idea of form, by putting an end to all
idea of resistance, by paying no attention to the idea of distinction,
he, thinking "it is all infinite space," reaches (mentally) and remains
in the state of mind in which the idea of the infinity of space is the
only idea that is present--this is the fourth stage of deliverance.

38\. 'By passing quite beyond all idea of space being the infinite
basis, he, thinking "it is all infinite reason," reaches (mentally) and
remains in the state of mind to which the infinity of reason is alone
present--this is the fifth stage of deliverance.

39\. 'By passing quite beyond the mere consciousness of the infinity of
reason, he, thinking "nothing at all exists," reaches (mentally) and
remains in the state of mind to which nothing at all is specially
present--this is the sixth stage of deliverance.

40\. 'By passing quite beyond all idea of nothingness he reaches
(mentally) and remains in the state of mind to which neither ideas nor
the absence of ideas are specially present--this is the seventh stage of
deliverance.

41\. 'By passing quite beyond the state of "neither ideas nor the
absence of ideas" he reaches (mentally) and remains in the state of mind
in which both sensations and ideas have ceased to be-this is the eighth
stage of deliverance.

42\. 'Now these, Ânanda, are the eight stages of deliverance.

------------------------

43\. 'On one occasion, Ânanda, I was resting under the shepherd's
Nigrodha tree on the bank of the

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

river Nera*ñ*garâ immediately after having reached the great
enlightenment. Then Mâra, the Evil One, came, Ânanda, to the place where
I was, and standing beside me he addressed me in the words: "Pass away
now, Lord, from existence! Let the Blessed One now die! Now is the time
for the Blessed One to pass away!"

44\. 'And when he had thus spoken, Ânanda, I addressed Mâra, the Evil
One, and said: "I shall not die, O Evil One! until not only the brethren
and sisters of the order, but also the lay-disciples of either sex shall
have become true hearers, wise and well-trained, ready and learned,
versed in the Scriptures, fulfilling all the greater and the lesser
duties, correct in life, walking according to the precepts--until they,
having thus themselves learned the doctrine, shall be able to tell
others of it, preach it, make it known, establish it, open it, minutely
explain it and make it clear--until they, when others start vain
doctrine, shall be able by the truth to vanquish and refute it, and so
to spread the wonder-working truth abroad!

45\. '"I shall not die until this pure religion of mine shall have
become successful, prosperous, wide-spread, and popular in all its full
extent--until, in a word, it shall have been well proclaimed among men!"

46\. 'And now again to-day, Ânanda, at the *K*âpâla *K*etiya, Mara, the
Evil One, came to the place where I was, and standing beside me
addressed me \[in the same words\].

47\. 'And when he had thus spoken, Ânanda, I answered him and said:
"Make thyself happy, the final extinction of the Tathâgata shall take
place

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

before long. At the end of three months from this time the Tathâgata
will die!"

48\. 'Thus, Ânanda, the Tathâgata has now to-day at the *K*âpâla
*K*etiya consciously and deliberately rejected the rest of his allotted
term of life.'

49\. And when he had thus spoken the venerable Ânanda addressed the
Blessed One, and said: 'Vouchsafe, Lord, to remain during the kalpa!
live on through the kalpa, O Blessed One! for the good and the happiness
of the great multitudes, out of pity for the world, for the good and the
gain and the weal of gods and men!'

50\. 'Enough now, Ânanda, beseech not the Tathâgata!' was the reply.
'The time for making such request is past.'

51\. And again, the second time, the venerable Ânanda besought the
Blessed One \[in the same words. And he received from the Blessed One
the same reply\].

52\. And again, the third time, the venerable Ânanda besought the
Blessed One \[in the same words\].

53\. 'Hast thou faith, Ânanda, in the wisdom of the Tathâgata?'

'Even so, Lord!'

'Now why, then, Ânanda, dost thou trouble the Tathâgata even until the
third time?'

54\. 'From his own mouth have I heard from the Blessed One, from his own
mouth have I received this saying, "Whosoever has thought out, Ânanda,
and developed, practised, accumulated, and ascended to the very heights
of the four paths to saintship, and so mastered them as to be able to
use them as

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

a means of (mental) advancement, and as a basis for edification--he,
should he desire it, could remain in the same birth for a kalpa, or for
that portion of a kalpa which has yet to run." Now the Tathâgata has
thought out and thoroughly practised them \[in all respects as just now
fully described\], and might, should he desire it, remain alive for a
kalpa, or for that portion of a kalpa which has yet to run.'

55\. 'Hast thou faith, Ânanda?'

'Even so, Lord!'

'Then, O Ânanda, thine is the fault, thine is the offence-in that when a
suggestion so evident and a hint so clear were thus given thee by the
Tathâgata, thou wast yet incapable of comprehending them, and thou
besoughtest not the Tathâgata, saying, "Vouchsafe, Lord, to remain
during the kalpa. Live on, O Blessed One! through the kalpa for the good
and the happiness of the great multitudes, out of pity for the world,
for the good and the gain and the weal of gods and men." If thou
shouldst then have so besought the Tathâgata, the Tathâgata might have
rejected the appeal even to the second time, but the third time he would
have granted it. Thine, therefore, O Ânanda, is the fault, thine is the
offence!'

56\. 'On one occasion, Ânanda, I was dwelling at Râ*g*agaha, on the hill
called the Vulture's Peak. Now there, Ânanda, I spoke to thee, and said:
"How pleasant a spot, Ânanda, is Râ*g*agaha; how pleasant is this
Vulture's Peak. Whosoever has thought out, Ânanda, and developed,
practised, accumulated, and ascended to the very heights of the four
paths to saintship, and so mastered them as to be able to use them as a
means of (mental) advancement, and as a basis for edification--he,
should he

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

desire it, could remain in the same birth for a kalpa, or for that
portion of a kalpa which has yet to run. But even when a suggestion so
evident and a hint so clear were thus given thee by the Tathâgata, thou
wast yet incapable of comprehending them, and thou besoughtest not the
Tathâgata, saying, 'Vouchsafe, Lord, to remain during the kalpa. Live
on, O Blessed One! through the kalpa for the good and the happiness of
the great multitudes, out of pity for the world, for the good and the
gain and the weal of gods and men.' If thou shouldst then have so
besought the Tathâgata, the Tathâgata might have rejected the appeal
even to the second time, but the third time he would have granted it.
Thine, therefore, O Ânanda, is the fault, thine is the offence!"

57\. 'On one occasion, Ânanda, I was dwelling at that same Râ*g*agaha in
the Banyan Grove--on one occasion at that same Râ*g*agaha at the
Robbers' Cliff--on one occasion at that same Râ*g*agaha in the
Sattapa*nn*i cave on the slope of Mount Vebhâra--on one occasion at that
same Râ*g*agaha at the Black Rock on the slope of Mount Isigili--on one
occasion at that same Râ*g*agaha in the Sîtavana Grove in the mountain
cave Sappaso*nd*ika--on one occasion at that same Râ*g*agaha in the
Tapoda Grove--on one occasion at that same Râ*g*agaha in the Bambu Grove
in the Squirrels' Feeding Ground--on one occasion at that same
Râ*g*agaha in *G*îvaka's Mango Grove--on one occasion at that same
Râ*g*agaha in the Deer Forest at Maddaku*kkh*i.'

58\. 'Now there too, Ânanda, I spoke to thee, and said: "How pleasant,
Ânanda, is Râ*g*agaha; how pleasant the Vulture's Peak; how pleasant the

Banyan tree of Gotama; how pleasant the Robbers' Cliff; how pleasant the
Sattapa*nn*i cave on the slope of Mount Vebhâra; how pleasant the Black
Rock on the slope of Mount Isigili; how pleasant the mountain cave
Sappaso*nd*ika in the Sîtavana Grove; how pleasant the Tapoda Grove; how
pleasant the Squirrels' Feeding Ground in the Bambu Grove; how pleasant
*G*îvaka's Mango Grove; how pleasant the Deer Forest at Maddaku*kkh*i!

59\. '"Whosoever, Ânanda, has thought out and developed, practised,
accumulated, and ascended to the very heights of the four paths to
saintship, and so mastered them as to be able to use them as a means of
(mental) advancement and as a basis for edification--he, should he
desire it, could remain in the same birth for a kalpa, or for that
portion of a kalpa which has yet to run." Now the Tathâgata has thought
out and thoroughly practised them \[in all respects as just now fully
described\], and might, should he desire it, remain alive for a kalpa,
or for that portion of a kalpa which has yet to run.'

60\. 'On one occasion, Ânanda, I was residing here at Vesâli at the
Udena *K*etiya. And there too, Ânanda, I spoke to thee, and said: "How
pleasant, Ânanda, is Vesâli; how pleasant the Udena *K*etiya. Whosoever,
Ânanda, has thought out and developed, practised, accumulated, and
ascended to the very heights of the four paths to saintship, and so

them \[in all respects as just now fully described\], and might, should
he desire it, remain alive for a kalpa, or for that portion of a kalpa

61\. 'On one occasion, Ânanda, I was dwelling here at Vesâli at the
Gotamaka *K*etiya--on one occasion here at Vesâli at the Sattamba
*K*etiya--on one occasion here at Vesâli at the Bahuputta *K*etiya--on
one occasion here at Vesâli at the Sârandada *K*etiya \[and on each
occasion I spoke to thee, Ânanda, in the same words\].

62\. 'And now to-day, Ânanda, at the *K*âpâla *K*etiya, I spoke to thee,
and said: "How pleasant, Ânanda, is Vesâli; how pleasant the Udena
*K*etiya; how pleasant the Gotamaka *K*etiya; how pleasant the Sattamba

\[1. That pa*t*iga*kk*' eva means 'formerly, already' is clear from Mahâ
Vagga I, 7, 1; X, 2, 3, though its derivation would seem to render the
meaning 'frequently, recurringly' more natural. The {footnote p. 59}
phrase occurs pretty often. Trenckner (milinda-pa*ñ*ha*m*, p. 422)
proposes a correction into pa*t*ika*kk*' eva. Palu*gg*îti just below is
noteworthy as an unusual contraction of palu*gg*e iti.\]

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

to you that it is in the very nature of all things, near and dear unto
us, that we must divide ourselves from them, leave them, sever ourselves
from them? How then, Ânanda, can this be possible--whereas anything
whatever born, brought into being, and organised, contains within itself
the inherent necessity of dissolution--how then can this be possible
that such a being should not be dissolved? No such condition can exist!
And this mortal being, Ânanda, has been relinquished, cast away,
renounced, rejected, and abandoned by the Tathâgata. The remaining sum
of life has been surrendered by him. Verily, the word has gone forth
from the Tathâgata, saying, "The final extinction of the Tathâgata shall
take place before long. At the end of three months from this time the
Tathâgata will die!" That the Tathâgata for the sake of living should
repent him again of that saying--this can no wise be\[1\]!'

------------------------

64\. 'Come, Ânanda, let us go to the Kû*t*âgâra Hall, to the Mahâvana.'

'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed
One.

Then the Blessed One proceeded, with Ânanda

\[1. I do not understand the connection of ideas between this paragraph
and the idea repeated with such tedious iteration in the preceding
paragraphs. The two seem to be in marked contrast, if not in absolute
contradiction. Perhaps we have here the older tradition and certainly
the latter utterance of the two is more in accordance with the general
impression of the character, and with the other sayings, of Gotama as
handed down in the Pâli Pi*t*akas.\]

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

with him, to the Mahâvana to the Kû*t*âgâra Hall: and when he had
arrived there he addressed the venerable Ânanda, and said:

'Go now, Ânanda, and assemble in the Service Hall such of the brethren
as reside in the neighbourhood of Vesâli.'

'Even so, Lord,' said the venerable Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed
One. And when he had assembled in the Service Hall such of the brethren
as resided in the neighbourhood of Vesâli, he went to the Blessed One
and saluted him and stood beside him. And standing beside him, he
addressed the Blessed One, and said:

'Lord! the assembly of the brethren has met together. Let the Blessed
One do even as seemeth to him fit.'

65\. Then the Blessed One proceeded to the Service Hall, and sat down
there on the mat spread out for him. And when he was seated the Blessed
One addressed the brethren, and said:

'Therefore, O brethren--ye to whom the truths I have perceived have been
made known by me--having thoroughly made yourselves masters of them,
practise them, meditate upon them, and spread them abroad; in order that
pure religion may last long and be perpetuated, in order that it may
continue to be for the good and happiness of the great multitudes, out
of pity for the world, to the good and the gain and the weal of gods and
men!

'Which then, O brethren, are the truths which, when I had perceived, I
made known to you, which, when you have mastered it behoves you to
practise, meditate upon, and spread abroad, in order that pure religion
may last long and be perpetuated, in order

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

that it may continue to be for the good and the happiness of the great
multitudes, out of pity for the world, to the good and the gain and the
weal of gods and men?'

They are these:

The four earnest meditations.  
The fourfold great struggle against sin.  
The four roads to saintship.  
The five moral powers.  
The five organs of spiritual sense.  
The seven kinds of wisdom, and  
The noble eightfold path.

These, O brethren, are the truths which, when I had perceived, I made
known to you, which, when you have mastered it behoves you to practise,
meditate upon, and spread abroad, in order that pure religion may last
long and be perpetuated, in order that it may continue to be for the
good and the happiness of the great multitudes, out of pity for the
world, to the good and the gain and the weal of gods and men!

------------------------

66\. And the Blessed One exhorted the brethren, and said:

'Behold now, O brethren, I exhort you, saying, "All component things
must grow old. Work out your salvation with diligence. The final
extinction of the Tathâgata will take place before long. At the end of
three months from this time the Tathâgata will die!"

'My age is now full ripe, my life draws to its close:  
I leave you, I depart, relying on myself alone!  
Be earnest then, O brethren! holy, full of thought! <span
id="page_62">p. 62</span>  
Be steadfast in resolve! Keep watch o'er your own hearts!  
Who wearies not, but holds fast to this truth and law\[1\],  
Shall cross this sea of life, shall make an end of grief.'

------------------------

End of the Third Portion for Recitation

\[1. Dhamma and vinaya. The Buddhist religion, as just summarised, and
the regulations of the order.

2 It is of great interest to notice what are the points upon which
Gotama, in this last address to his disciples, and at the solemn time
when death was so near at hand, is reported to have lain such emphatic
stress. Unfortunately we have only a fragment of the address, and, as it
would seem from its commencement, only the closing fragment. This,
however, is in the form of a summary, consisting of an enumeration of
certain aggregates, the details of which must have been as familiar to
the early Buddhists as the details of similar numerical terms--such as
the ten commandments, the twelve tribes, the seven deadly sins, the four
gospels, and so on--afterwards were to the Christians. This summary of
the Buddha's last address may fairly be taken as a summary of Buddhism,
which thus appears to be simply a system of earnest self-culture and
self-control.

The following are the details of the aggregate technical terms used in
the above summary, but it will be understood that the English
equivalents used give rather a general than an exact representation of
the ideas expressed by the Pâli ones. To attempt more would demand a
treatise rather than a note, and it has given me peculiar pleasure to
learn, as these sheets are passing through the press, that my friend Dr.
Morris intends to devote a book to the treatment of these seven 'Jewels
of the Law,' as the *K*ulla Vagga calls them (IX, 1, 4), which form,
when united, the bright diadem of Nirvâ*n*a.

The four Earnest Meditations (*k*attâro Satipa*tth*ânâ) are--

1\. Meditation on the body.  
2. Meditation on the sensations.  
3. Meditation on the ideas.  
4. Meditation on reason and character.

{footnote p. 63}

The fourfold Great Struggle against sin is divided into *k*attâro
Samappadhânâ, which are--

1\. The struggle to prevent sinfulness arising.  
2. The struggle to put away sinful states which have arisen.  
3. The struggle to produce goodness not previously existing.  
4. The struggle to increase goodness when it does exist.

The four Roads to Saintship are four means by which Iddhî (see above, §
3, note) is to be acquired. They are the *K*attâro Iddhipâdâ:

1\. The will to acquire it united to earnest meditation and the struggle
against sin.  
2. The necessary exertion united to earnest meditation and the struggle
against sin.  
3. The necessary preparation of the heart united to earnest meditation
and the struggle against sin.  
4. Investigation united to earnest meditation and the struggle against
sin.

The five moral powers (pa*ñk*a Balâni) are said to be the same as the
next class, called organs (Indriyâni). It is no doubt most remarkable
that, in a summary like this, two classes out of seven should be
absolutely identical except in name. The difference of name is
altogether too unimportant to account, by itself, for the distinction
made. Either the currently accepted explanation of one of the two
aggregate terms must be incorrect, or we must look for some explanation
of the repetition other than the mere desire to record the double title.
Is it impossible that the one class was split into two to bring the
number of the classes up to the sacred number seven, corresponding to
the seven Ratanas of a *K*akkavatti?

The details of both classes are--

1\. Faith. 2. Energy. 3. Thought. 4. Contemplation. 5. Wisdom.

The seven kinds of Wisdom (satta Bo*ggh*angâ) are--

1\. Energy. 2. Thought. 3. Contemplation. 4. Investigation (of
scripture). 5. Joy. 6. Repose. 7. Serenity.

The Noble Eightfold Path (ariyo a*tth*angiko Maggo) forms the subject of
the Dhamma-*k*akka-ppavattana-Sutta, translated in this volume, and
consists of--

1\. Right views. 2. High aims. 3. Right speech. 4. Upright conduct. 5. A
harmless livelihood. 6. Perseverance in well-doing. 7. Intellectual
activity. 8. Earnest thought.\]

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

### CHAPTER IV.

1\. Now the Blessed One early in the morning robed himself, and taking
his bowl, entered Vesâli for alms: and when he had passed through
Vesâli, and had eaten his meal and was returning from his alms-seeking
he gazed at Vesâli with an elephant look\[1\] and addressed the
venerable Ânanda, and said: 'This will be the last time, Ânanda, that
the Tathâgata will behold Vesâli. Come, Ânanda, let us go on to
Bha*nd*a-gâma.'

'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed
One.

And the Blessed One proceeded with a great company of the brethren to
Bha*nd*a-gâma; and there the Blessed One stayed in the village itself.

2\. There the Blessed One addressed the brethren, and said: 'It is
through not understanding and grasping four truths\[2\], O brethren,
that we have had to run so long, to wander so long in this weary path of
transmigration--both you and I.'

'And what are these four? The noble conduct of life, the noble
earnestness in meditation, the noble kind of wisdom, and the noble
salvation of freedom. But when noble conduct is realised and known, when
noble meditation is realised and known, when noble wisdom is realised
and known, when noble

\[1. Nâgapalokita*m* Vesâliya*m* apaloketvâ. The Buddhas were
accustomed, says Buddhaghosa, on looking backwards to turn the whole
body round as an elephant does; because the bones in their neck were
firmly fixed, more so than those of ordinary men!

2\. Or Conditions (Dhammâ). They must, of course, be carefully
distinguished from the better known Four Noble Truths (Sa*kk*âni) above,
Chap. II, § 2.\]

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

freedom is realised and known--then is the craving for existence rooted
out, that which leads to renewed existence is destroyed, and there is no
more birth.'

3\. Thus spake the Blessed One; and when the Happy One had thus spoken,
then again the teacher said\[1\]:

'Righteousness, earnest thought, wisdom, and freedom sublime--  
These are the truths realised by Gotama, far-renowned.  
Knowing them, he, the knower, proclaimed the truth to the brethren.  
The master with eye divine, the quencher of griefs, must die!'

------------------------

4\. There too, while staying at Bha*nd*a-gâma, the Blessed One held that
comprehensive religious discourse with the brethren on the nature of
upright conduct, and of earnest contemplation, and of intelligence.
'Great is the fruit, great the advantage of earnest contemplation when
set round with upright conduct. Great is the fruit, great the advantage
of intellect when set round with earnest contemplation.

\[1. This is merely a stock phrase for introducing verses which repeat
the idea of the preceding phrase (see above, paragraph 32). It is an
instructive sign of the state of mind in which such records are put
together, that these verses could be ascribed to Gotama himself without
any feeling of the incongruity involved. The last word means, completely
gone out; and here refers to the extinction of kilesa and ta*n*hâ, which
will bring about, inevitably, the extinction of being. Compare the
passage quoted by Burnouf in Lotus de la Bonne Loi, p. 376. Probably the
whole stanza formerly stood in some other connection, where the word
parinibbuto had its more usual sense. See Buddhaghosa's note on IV,
23.\]

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span> The mind set round with intelligence is
freed from the great evils--that is to say, from sensuality, from
individuality, from delusion, and from ignorance.'

5\. Now when the Blessed One had remained at Bha*nd*a-gâma as long as he
desired, he addressed the venerable Ânanda, and said: 'Come, Ânanda, let
us go on to Hatthi-gâma.'

Even so, Lord!' said Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed One.

Then the Blessed One proceeded with a great company of the brethren to
Hatthi-gâma.

6\. \[And in similar words it is then related how the Blessed One went
on to Amba-gâma, to *G*ambu-gâma, and to Bhoga-nagara.\]

7\. Now there at Bhoga-nagara the Blessed One stayed at the Ânanda
*K*etiya.

There the Blessed One addressed the brethren, and said: 'I will teach
you, O brethren, these four Great References\[1\]. Listen thereto, and
give good heed, and I will speak.'

'Even so, Lord!' said the brethren, in assent\[2\], to

\[1. The meaning of mahâpadesa is not quite clear. Perhaps it should be
rendered true authorities. I have followed Buddhaghosa in taking apadesa
as the last part of the compound. He says, mahâpadesâ ti mahâ-okâse
mahâ-apadese vâ. Buddhâdayo mahante mahante apadisitvâ vuttâni
mahâkara*n*ânî ti attho, 'the causes (authorities) alleged when
referring to Buddha and other great men.'

2\. I ought perhaps to have explained why I have ventured to differ from
Childers in the rendering of the common word pa*t*i-su*n*âti. The root
*s*ru seems to have meant 'to sound' before it meant 'to hear;' and,
whether this be so or not, pa*t*i-su*n*âti means not simply 'to
consent,' but 'to answer (assentingly).' it {footnote p. 67} has been
pointed out to me that answer was formerly 'and-swerian,' where swerian

the Blessed One, and the Blessed One spoke as follows:

8\. 'In the first place, brethren, a brother may say thus: "From the
mouth of the Blessed One himself have I heard, from his own mouth have I
received it. This is the truth, this the law, this the teaching of the
Master." The word spoken, brethren, by that brother should neither be
received with praise nor treated with scorn. Without praise and without
scorn every word and syllable should be carefully understood, and then
put beside the scripture and compared with the rules of the order\[1\].
If when so compared they do not harmonise with the scripture, and do not
fit in with the rules of the order, then you may come to the conclusion,
"Verily, this is not the word of the Blessed One, and has been wrongly
grasped by that brother?" Therefore, brethren, you should reject it. But
if they harmonise with the scripture and fit in with the rules of the
order, then you may come to the conclusion, "Verily, this is the word of
the Blessed One, and has been well grasped by that brother." This,
brethren, you should receive as the first Great Reference.

9\. 'Again, brethren, a brother may say thus: "In such and such a
dwelling-place there is a company of the brethren with their elders and
leaders. From the mouth of that company have I heard,

\[1. Sutte otâretabbâni vinaye sandassetabbâni, where one would expect
to find the word Pi*t*aka if it had been in use when this passage was
first written or composed.\]

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

face to face have I received it. This is the truth, this the law, this
the teaching of the Master." The word spoken, brethren, by that brother
should neither be received with praise nor treated with scorn. Without
praise and without scorn every word and syllable should be carefully
understood, and then put beside the scripture and compared with the
rules of the order. If when so compared they do not harmonise with the
scripture, and do not fit in with the rules of the order, then you may
come to the conclusion, "Verily, this is not the word of the Blessed
One, and has been wrongly grasped by that company of the brethren."
Therefore, brethren, you should reject it. But if they harmonise with
the scripture and fit in with the rules of the order, then you may come
to the conclusion, "Verily, this is the word of the Blessed One, and has
been well grasped by that company of the brethren." This, brethren, you
should receive as the second Great Reference.

10\. 'Again, brethren, a brother may say thus: "In such and such a
dwelling-place there are dwelling many elders of the order, deeply read,
holding the faith as handed down by tradition, versed in the truths,
versed in the regulations of the order, versed in the summaries of the
doctrines and the law. From the mouth of those elders have I heard, from
their mouth have I received it. This is the truth, this the law, this
the teaching of the Master." The word spoken, brethren, by that brother
should neither be received with praise nor treated with scorn. Without
praise and without scorn every word and syllable should be carefully
understood, and then put beside the scripture and

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

compared with the rules of the order. If when so compared they do not
harmonise with the scripture, and do not fit in with the rules of the
order, then you may come to the conclusion, "Verily, this is not the
word of the Blessed One, and has been wrongly grasped by those elders."
Therefore, brethren, you should reject it. But if they harmonise with
the scripture and fit in with the rules of the order, then you may come
to the conclusion, "Verily, this is the word of the Blessed One, and has
been well grasped by those elders." This, brethren, you should receive
as the third Great Reference.

11\. 'Again, brethren, a brother may say, "In such and such a
dwelling-place there is there living a brother, deeply read, holding the
faith as handed down by tradition, versed in the truths, versed in the
regulations of the order, versed in the summaries of the doctrines and
the law. From the mouth of that elder have I heard, from his mouth have
I received it. This is the truth, this the law, this the teaching of the
Master." The word spoken, brethren, by that brother should neither be
received with praise nor treated with scorn. Without praise and without
scorn every word and syllable should be carefully understood, and then

"Verily, this is not the word of the Blessed One, and has been wrongly
grasped by that brother." Therefore, brethren, you should reject it. But
if they harmonise with the scripture

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

and fit in with the rules of the order, then you may come to the
conclusion, "Verily, this is the word of the Blessed One, and has been
well grasped by that brother." This, brethren, you should receive as the
fourth Great Reference.'

'These, brethren, are the Four Great References.'

------------------------

12\. There, too, the Blessed One held that comprehensive religious talk
with the brethren on the nature of upright conduct, and of earnest
contemplation, and of intelligence. 'Great is the fruit, great the
advantage of earnest contemplation when set round with upright conduct.
Great is the fruit, great the advantage of intellect when set round with
earnest contemplation. The mind set round with intelligence is freed
from the great evils--that is to say, from sensuality, from
individuality, from delusion, and from ignorance.'

------------------------

13\. Now when the Blessed One had remained as long as he desired at
Bhoga-gâma, he addressed the venerable Ânanda, and said: 'Come, Ânanda,
let us go on to Pâvâ.'

'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed
One. And the Blessed One proceeded with a great company of the brethren
to Pâvâ.

And there at Pâvâ the Blessed One stayed at the Mango Grove of *K*unda,
who was by family a smith.

------------------------

14\. Now *K*unda, the worker in metals, heard that the Blessed One had
come to Pâvâ, and was staying there in his Mango Grove.

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

And *K*unda, the worker in metals, went to the place where the Blessed
One was, and saluting him took his seat respectfully on one side. And
when he was thus seated, the Blessed One instructed, aroused, incited,
and gladdened him with religious discourse.

15\. Then he, instructed, aroused, incited, and gladdened by the
religious discourse, addressed the Blessed One, and said: 'May the
Blessed One do me the honour of taking his meal, together with the
brethren, at my house to-morrow.'

And the Blessed One signified, by silence, his consent.

16\. Then seeing that the Blessed One had consented, *K*unda, the worker
in metals, rose from his seat and bowed down before the Blessed One, and
keeping him on his right hand as he past him, departed thence.

17\. Now at the end of the night, *K*unda, the worker in metals, made
ready in his dwelling-place sweet rice and cakes, and a quantity of
dried boar's flesh. And he announced the hour to the Blessed One,
saying, 'The hour, Lord, has come, and the meal is ready.'

18\. And the Blessed One robed himself early in the morning, and taking
his bowl, went with the brethren to the dwelling-place of *K*unda, the
worker in metals. When he had come thither he seated himself on the seat
prepared for him. And when he was seated he addressed *K*unda, the
worker in metals, and said: 'As to the dried boar's flesh you have made
ready, serve me with it, *K*unda; and as to the other food, the sweet
rice and cakes, serve the brethren with it.'

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

'Even so, Lord!' said *K*unda, the worker in metals, in assent, to the
Blessed One. And the dried boar's flesh he had made ready he served to
the Blessed One; whilst the other food, the sweet rice and cakes, he
served to the members of the order.

19\. Now the Blessed One addressed Kunda, the worker in metals, and
said: 'Whatever dried boar's flesh, *K*unda, is left over to thee, that
bury in a hole. I see no one, *K*unda, on earth nor in Mâra's heaven,
nor in Brahma's heaven, no one among Sama*n*as and Brâhma*n*as, among
gods and men, by whom, when he has eaten it, that food can be
assimilated, save by the Tathâgata.'

'Even so, Lord!' said *K*unda, the worker in metals, in assent, to the
Blessed One. And whatever dried boar's flesh remained over, that he
buried in a hole.

20\. And he went to the place where the Blessed One was; and when he had
come there, took his seat respectfully on one side. And when he was
seated, the Blessed One instructed and aroused and incited and gladdened
*K*unda, the worker in metals, with religious discourse. And the Blessed
One then rose from his seat and departed thence.

21\. Now when the Blessed One had eaten the food prepared by *K*unda,
the worker in metal, there fell upon him a dire sickness, the disease of
dysentery, and sharp pain came upon him, even unto death. But the
Blessed One, mindful and self-possessed, bore it without complaint.

22\. And the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ânanda, and said:
'Come, Ânanda, let us go on to Kusinârâ.'

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed
One.

------------------------

23\. When he had eaten *K*unda's food,  
The copper-smith's--thus have I heard--  
He bore with fortitude the pain,  
The sharp pain even unto death!

And from the dried flesh of the boar, as soon as he had eaten it,  
    There fell upon the teacher sickness dire,  
Then after nature was relieved the Blessed One announced and said:  
    I now am going on to Kusinârâ\[1\].'

24\. Now the Blessed One went aside from the path to the foot of a
certain tree; and when he had come there he addressed the venerable
Ânanda, and said: 'Fold, I pray you, Ânanda, the robe; and spread it out
for me. I am weary, Ânanda, and must rest awhile!'

'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed
One, and spread out the robe folded fourfold.

25\. And the Blessed One seated himself on the seat prepared for him;
and when he was seated, he addressed the venerable Ânanda, and said:
'Fetch me, I pray you, Ânanda, some water. I am thirsty, Ânanda, and
would drink.'

26\. When he had thus spoken, the venerable Ânanda said to the Blessed
One: 'But just now,

\[1. 'It should be understood,' says Buddhaghosa, 'that these are verses
by the Theras who held the council.' And he repeats this at §§ 52, 56.\]

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

Lord, about five hundred carts have gone over. That water stirred up by
the wheels has become shallow and flows fouled and turbid. This river
Kakutthâ, Lord, not far off, is clear and pleasant, cool and
transparent, easy to get down into, and delightful. There the Blessed
One may both drink the water, and cool his limbs\[1\].'

27\. Again the second time the Blessed One addressed the venerable
Ânanda, and said: 'Fetch me, I pray you, Ânanda, some water. I am
thirsty, Ânanda, and would drink.'

28\. And again the second time the venerable Ânanda said to the Blessed
One: 'But just now, Lord, about five hundred carts have gone over. That
water stirred up by the wheels has become shallow and flows fouled and
turbid. This river Kakutthâ, Lord, not far off, is clear and pleasant,
cool and transparent, easy to get down into, and delightful. There the
Blessed One may both drink the water, and cool his limbs.'

29\. Again the third time the Blessed One addressed the venerable
Ânanda, and said: 'Fetch me, I pray you, Ânanda, some water. I am
thirsty, Ânanda, and would drink.'

30\. 'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable Ânanda, in assent, to the
Blessed One; and taking a bowl he went down to the streamlet. And lo!
the streamlet which, stirred up by the wheels, was but just now become
shallow, and was flowing fouled and turbid, had begun, when the
venerable Ânanda came up to it, to flow clear and bright and free from
all turbidity.

\[1. A*kkh*odikâ ti pasannodikâ: sâtodikâ ti madhurodhikâ sîtitodika ti
tanu-sîtala-salilâ: setakâ ti nikkaddamâ: supatitthâ ti sundara-titthâ.
(S.V. *thri*.) Comp. IV, 56.\]

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

31\. Then Ânanda thought: 'How wonderful, how marvellous is the great
might and power of the Tathâgata! For this Streamlet which, stirred up
by the wheels, was but just now become shallow and flowing foul and
turbid, now, as I come up to it, is flowing clear and bright and free
from all turbidity.'

32\. And taking water in the bowl he returned towards the Blessed One;
and when he had come where the Blessed One was he said to him: 'How
wonderful, how marvellous is the great might and power of the Tathâgata!
For this streamlet which, stirred up by the wheels, was but just now
become shallow and flowing foul and turbid, now, as I come up to it, is
flowing clear and bright and free from all turbidity. Let the Blessed
One drink the water! Let the Happy One drink the water!'

Then the Blessed One drank of the water.

------------------------

33\. Now at that time a man named Pukkusa\[1\] a young Mallian, a
disciple of Â*l*âra Kâlâma's, was passing along the high road from
Kusinârâ to Pâvâ.

34\. And Pukkusa, the young Mallian, saw the Blessed One seated at the
foot of a tree. On seeing him, he went up to the place where the Blessed
One was, and when he had come there he saluted the Blessed One, and took
his rest respectfully on one side. And when he was seated

\[1. The Pukkusa caste was one of the lower castes of Sûdras. Compare
Assâlâyana Sutta (Pischel), pp. 13, 35; Burnouf's 'Introduction,' &c.,
pp. 144, 208; Lalita Vistara XXI, 17. But Buddhaghosa says Pukkusa must
here be simply a name, as the Mallas were of the Khattiya caste. He adds
that this Pukkusa was the owner of the five hundred carts that had just
passed by; and that Â*l*âra Kâlâma was called Â*l*âra because he was
Dîgha-pi<u>n</u>galo, Kâlâma being his family name.\]

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span> Pukkusa, the young Mallian, said to the
Blessed One: 'How wonderful a thing is it, Lord! and how marvellous,
that those who have gone forth out of the world should pass their time
in a state of mind so calm!'

35\. 'Formerly, Lord, Â*l*âra Kâlâma a was once walking along the high
road; and leaving the road he sat himself down under a certain tree to
rest during the heat of the day. Now, Lord, five hundred carts passed by
one after the other, each close to Â*l*âra Kâlâma. And a certain man,
who was following close behind that caravan of carts, went up to the
place where Â*l*âra Kâlâma, was, and when he was come there he spake as
follows to Â*l*âra Kâlâma:

'"But, Lord, did you see those five hundred carts go by?"

'"No, indeed, sir, I saw them not."

'"But, Lord, did you hear the sound of them?"

'"No, indeed, sir, I heard not their sound."

'"But, Lord, were you then asleep?"

'"No, sir, I was not asleep."

'"But, Lord, were you then conscious?"

'"Yes, I was conscious, sir."

'"So that you, Lord, though you were both conscious and awake, neither
saw, nor heard the sound of five hundred carts passing by, one after the
other, and each close to you. Why, Lord, even your robe was sprinkled
over with the dust of them!"

'"It is even so, sir."

36\. 'Then thought that man: "How wonderful a thing is it, and how
marvellous, that those who have gone forth out of the world should pass
their time in a state of mind so calm! So much so that a man though
being both conscious and awake,

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

neither sees, nor hears the sound of five hundred carts passing by, one
after the other, and each close to him."

'And after giving utterance to his deep faith in Â*l*âra Kâlâma, he
departed thence.'

37\. 'Now what think you, Pukkusa, which is the more difficult thing
either to do or to meet with--that a man being conscious and awake
should neither see, nor hear the sound of five hundred carts passing by,
one after the other, close to him,--or that a man, being conscious and
awake, should neither see, nor hear the sound thereof when the falling
rain goes on beating and splashing, and the lightnings are flashing
forth, and the thunderbolts are crashing?'

38\. 'What in comparison, Lord, can these five hundred carts do, or six
or seven or eight or nine or ten hundred, yea, even hundreds and
thousands of carts. That certainly is more difficult, both to do and to
meet with, that a man being conscious and awake should neither see, nor
hear the sound thereof when the falling rain goes on beating and
splashing, and the lightnings are flashing forth, and the thunderbolts
are crashing.'

39\. 'Now on one occasion, Pukkusa, I was dwelling at Âtumâ, and was at
the Threshing-floor\[1\]. And at that time the falling rain begun to
beat and to splash, and the lightnings to flash forth, and the
thunderbolts to crash; and two peasants, brothers, and four oxen were
killed. Then, Pukkusa, a great multitude of people went forth from
Âtumâ, and went up to the place where the two peasants, brothers, and
the four oxen, lay killed.

\[1. Bhusâgâre ti kha*l*u-sâlâya*m*. (S. V. *thri*.)\]

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

40\. 'Now at that time, Pukkusa, I had gone forth from the
Threshing-floor, and was walking up and down thinking at the entrance to
the Threshing-floor. And a certain man came, Pukkusa, out of that great
multitude of people, up to the place where I was; and when he came up he
saluted me, and took his place respectfully on one side.

41\. 'And as he stood there, Pukkusa, I said to the man:

'"Why then, sir, is this great multitude of people assembled together?"

'"But just now, the falling rain began to beat and to splash, and the
lightnings to flash forth, and the thunderbolts to crash; and two
peasants, brothers, were killed, and four oxen. Therefore is this great
multitude of people gathered together. But where, Lord, were you?"

'"I, sir, have been here all the while."

'"But, Lord, did you see it?"

'"I, sir, saw nothing."

'"But, Lord, did you hear it?"

'"I, sir, heard nothing."

'"Were you then, Lord, asleep?"

'"I, sir, was not asleep."

'"Were you then conscious, Lord?"

'"Even so, sir."

'"So that you, Lord, being conscious and awake, neither saw, nor heard
the sound thereof when the falling rain went on beating and splashing,
and the lightnings were flashing forth, and the thunderbolts were
crashing."

'"That is so, sir."

42\. 'Then, Pukkusa, the thought occurred to that man:

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

'"How wonderful a thing is it, and marvellous, that those who have gone
forth out of the world should pass their time in a state of mind so
calm!--so that a man being conscious and awake neither sees nor hears
the sound thereof when the falling rain is beating and splashing, and
the lightnings are flashing forth, and the thunderbolts are crashing."
And after giving utterance to his deep faith in me, he departed from me
with the customary demonstrations of respect.'

43\. And when he had thus spoken Pukkusa, the young Mallian, addressed
the Blessed One in these words: 'Now I, Lord, as to the faith that I had
in Â*l*âra Kâlâma, that I winnow away as in a mighty wind, and wash it
away as in a swiftly running stream. Most excellent, Lord, are the words
of thy mouth, most excellent! Just as if a man were to set up that which
is thrown down, or were to reveal that which is hidden away, or were to
point out the right road to him who has gone astray, or were to bring a
lamp into the darkness, so that those who have eyes can see external
forms-just even so, Lord, has the truth been made known to me, in many a
figure, by the Blessed One. And I, even I, betake myself, Lord, to the
Blessed One as my refuge, to the Truth, and to the Brotherhood. May the
Blessed One accept me as a disciple, as a true believer, from this day
forth, as long as life endures\[1\]!'

\[1. This is a stock phrase constituting the final answer of a hitherto
unconverted man at the end of one of those argumentative dialogues by
which Gotama overcame opposition or expounded the truth. After a
discussion of exalted themes it fits in very appropriately; here and
elsewhere it is incongruous and strained. See below, V, 50.\]

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

44\. Now Pukkusa, the young Mallian, addressed a certain man, and said:
'Fetch me, I pray you, my good man, a pair of robes of cloth of gold,
burnished and ready for wear.'

'So be it, sir!' said that man, in assent, to Pukkusa, the young
Mallian; and he brought a pair of robes of cloth of gold, burnished and
ready for wear.

45\. And the Mallian Pukkusa presented the pair of robes of cloth of
gold, burnished and ready for wear, to the Blessed One, saying, 'Lord,
this pair of robes of burnished cloth of gold is ready for wear. May the
Blessed One show me favour and accept it at my hands!'

'In that case, Pukkusa, robe me in one, and Ânanda in one.'

'Even so, Lord!' said Pukkusa, in assent, to the Blessed One; and in one
he robed the Blessed One, and in one, Ânanda.

46\. Then the Blessed One instructed and aroused and incited and
gladdened Pukkusa, the young Mallian, with religious discourse. And
Pukkusa, the young Mallian, when he had been instructed and aroused and
incited and gladdened by the Blessed One with religious discourse, arose
from his seat, and bowed down before the Blessed One; and keeping him on
his right hand as he past him, departed thence.

------------------------

47\. Now not long after the Mallian Pukkusa had Ânanda placed that pair
of robes of cloth of gold, burnished and ready for wear, on the body of
the Blessed One, and when it was so

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

placed on the body of the Blessed One it appeared to have lost its
splendour\[1\]!

48\. And the venerable Ânanda said to the Blessed One: 'How wonderful a
thing is it, Lord, and how marvellous, that the colour of the skin of
the Blessed One should be so clear, so exceeding bright! For when I
placed even this pair of robes of burnished cloth of gold and ready for
wear on the body of the Blessed One, lo! it seemed as if it had lost its
splendour!'

49\. 'It is even so, Ânanda. Ânanda, there: are two occasions on which
the colour of the skin of a Tathâgata becomes clear and exceeding
bright. What are the two?'

50\. 'On the night, Ânanda, on which a Tathâgata attains to the supreme
and perfect insight, and on the night in which he passes finally away in
that utter passing away which leaves nothing whatever to remain--on
these two occasions the colour of the skin of the Tathâgata becomes
clear and exceeding bright.

51\. 'And now this day, Ânanda, at the third watch of the night, in the
Upavattana of Kusinârâ, in the Sâla Grove of the Mallians, between the
twin Sâla

\[1. 'The commentator says, Bhagavato kâyam upanâmitan ti

used of embers in which food is cooked, without flame,' = glowing,
smoldering.' Vita*kkh*ikâ, 'an eruption on the skin,' belongs to the
root *k*ar*k*.\]

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

trees, the utter passing away of the Tathâgata will take place. Come,
Ânanda! let us go on to the river Kakutthâ.'

'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed
One.

52\. The pair of robes of cloth of gold,  
All burnished, Pukkusa had brought,  
Clad on with them the Master then  
Shone forth in colour like to gold\[1\]!

------------------------

53\. Now the Blessed One with a great company of the brethren went on to
the river Kakutthâ; and when he had come there, he went down into the
water, and bathed, and drank. And coming up out again on the other side
he went on to the Mango Grove.

54\. And when he was come there he addressed the venerable *K*undaka,
and said: 'Fold, I pray you, *K*undaka, a robe in four and spread it
out. I am weary, *K*undaka, and would lie down.'

'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable *K*undaka, in assent, to the Blessed
One. And he folded a robe in four, and spread it out.

\[1. We have here the commencement of the legend which afterwards grew
into an account of an actual 'transfiguration' of the Buddha. It is very
curious that it should have taken place soon after the Buddha had
announced to Ânanda his approaching death, and that in the Buddhist
Sutta it should be connected so closely with that event; for a similar
remark applies also to the Transfiguration mentioned in the Gospels. The
Mâlâ<u>n</u>kâra-vatthu, for instance, says, 'His body appeared shining
like a flame. Ânanda was exceedingly surprised. Nothing of this kind
had, as yet, happened. "Your exterior appearance," said he to Budha, "is
all at once white, shining, and beautiful above all expression." "What
you say, O Ânanda, is perfectly true. There are two occasions \[&c.,
much as above\]. The shining light emanating from my body is a certain
forerunner of this great event \[his Parinibbâna\]."\]

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

55\. And the Blessed One laid himself down on his right side, with one
foot resting on the other; and calm and self-possessed, he meditated on
the idea of rising up again in due time. And the venerable Kundaka
seated himself there in front of the Blessed One.

56\. The Buddha to Kakutthâ's river came,  
Whose clear and pleasant waters limpid flow,  
He plunged beneath the stream wearied and worn,  
The Buddha without equal in the world!  
When he had bathed and drunk, the teacher then  
Crossed o'er, the brethren thronging round his steps;  
The Blessed Master, preaching the while the truth,  
The Mighty Sage came to the Mango Grove.  
There spake he to the brother *K*undaka:  
'Spread me the fourfold robe out as a couch.'  
Cheered by the Holy One, he quickly spread  
The fourfold robe in order on the ground.  
The Master laid him down, wearied and worn;  
And there, before him, *K*unda took his seat.

------------------------

57\. And the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ânanda, and said: 'Now
it may happen, Ânanda, that some one should stir up remorse in *K*unda
the smith, by saying, "This is evil to thee, *K*unda, and loss to thee
in that when the Tathâgata had eaten his last meal from thy provision,
then he died." Any such remorse, Ânanda, in *K*unda the smith should be
checked by saying, "This is good to thee, *K*unda, and gain to thee, in
that when

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

the Tathâgata had eaten his last meal from thy provision, then he died.
From the very mouth of the Blessed One, *K*unda, have I heard, from his
own mouth have I received this saying, 'These two offerings of food are
of equal fruit, and of equal profit, and of much greater fruit and much
greater profit than any other--and which are the two? The offering of
food which, when a Tathâgata has eaten, he attains to supreme and
perfect insight; and the offering of food which, when a Tathâgata has
eaten, he passes away by that utter passing away in which nothing
whatever remains behind--these two offerings of food are of equal fruit
and of equal profit, and of much greater fruit and much greater profit
than any others. There has been laid up by *K*unda the smith a karma
redounding to length of life, redounding to good birth, redounding to
good fortune, redounding to good fame, redounding to the inheritance of
heaven, and of sovereign power.'" In this way, Ânanda, should be checked
any remorse in *K*unda the smith.'

58\. Then the Blessed One perceiving how the matter stood, uttered, even
at that time, this hymn of exultation:

To him who gives shall virtue be increased;  
In him who curbs himself, no anger can arise;  
The righteous man casts off all sinfulness,  
And by the rooting out of lust, and bitterness,  
And all delusion, doth to Nirvâ*n*a reach!'

### CHAPTER V.

1\. Now the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ânanda, and said: 'Come,
Ânanda, let us go on to the Sâla Grove of the Mallas, the Upavattana of
Kusinârâ, on the further side of the river Hiranyavatî.'

'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed
One.

2\. And the Blessed One proceeded with a great company of the brethren
to the Sâla Grove of the Mallas, the Upavattana of Kusinârâ, on the
further side of the river Hiranyavatî: and when he had come there he
addressed the venerable Ânanda, and said:

"Spread over for me, I pray you, Ânanda, the couch with its head to the
north, between the twin Sâla trees\[1\]. I am weary, Ânanda, and would
lie down.'

'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed
One. And he spread a

\[1. According to the commentator 'tradition says that there was a row
of Sâla trees at the head (sîsa) of that couch (ma*ñk*a), and another at
its foot, one young Sâla tree being close to its head, and another close
to its foot. The twin Sâla trees were so called because the two trees
were equally grown in respect of the roots, trunks, branches, and
leaves. There was a couch there in the park for the special use of the
(periodically elected) râ*g*a of the Mallas, and it was this couch which
the Blessed One asked Ânanda to make ready.' There is no further
explanation of the term uttara-sîsaka*m*, which may have been the name
for a slab of wood or stone reserved on great occasions for the use of
the leaders of the neighbouring republic, but available at other times
for passers by.\]

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

covering over the couch with its head to the north, between the twin
Sâla trees. And the Blessed One laid himself down on his right side,
with one leg resting on the other; and he was mindful and
self-possessed.

4\. Now at that time the twin Sâla trees were all one mass of bloom with
flowers out of season\[1\]; and all over the body of the Tathâgata these
dropped and sprinkled and scattered themselves, out of reverence for the
successor of the Buddhas of old. And heavenly Mandârava flowers, too,
and heavenly sandal-wood powder came falling from the sky, and all over
the body of the Tathâgata they descended and sprinkled and scattered
themselves, out of reverence for the successor of the Buddhas of old.
And heavenly music was sounded in the sky, out of reverence for the
successor of the Buddhas of old. And heavenly songs came wafted from the
skies, out of reverence for the successor of the Buddhas of old!

5\. Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ânanda, and said: 'The
twin Sâla trees are all one mass of bloom with flowers out of season;
all over the body of the Tathâgata these drop and sprinkle and scatter
themselves, out of reverence for the successor of the Buddhas of old.
And heavenly Mandârava flowers, too, and heavenly sandal-wood powder
come falling from the sky, and all over the body of the Tathâgata they
descend and sprinkle and scatter themselves, out of reverence

vana*m* at *G*âtaka I, 52.\]

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

for the successor of the Buddhas of old. And heavenly music sounds in
the sky, out of reverence for the successor of the Buddhas of old. And
heavenly songs come wafted from the skies, out of reverence for the
successor of the Buddhas of old!'

6\. 'Now it is not thus, Ânanda, that the Tathâgata is rightly honoured,
reverenced, venerated, held sacred or revered. But the brother or the
sister, the devout man or the devout woman, who continually fulfils all
the greater and the lesser duties, who is correct in life, walking
according to the precepts--it is he who rightly honours, reverences,
venerates, holds sacred, and reveres the Tathâgata with the worthiest
homage. Therefore, O Ânanda, be ye constant in the fulfilment of the
greater and of the lesser duties, and be ye correct in life, walking
according to the precepts; and thus, Ânanda, should it be taught.'

------------------------

7\. Now at that time the venerable Upâva*n*a was standing in front of
the Blessed One, fanning him. And the Blessed One was not pleased with
Upâva*n*a, and he said to him: 'Stand aside, O brother, stand not in
front of me!'

8\. Then this thought sprung up in the mind of the venerable Ânanda:
'The venerable Upâva*n*a has long been in close personal attendance and
service on the Blessed One. And now, at the last moment, the Blessed One
is not pleased with Upâva*n*a, and has said to him, "Stand aside, O
brother, stand not in front of me!" What may be the cause and what the
reason that the Blessed One is not pleased with Upâva*n*a, and speaks
thus with him?'

9\. And the venerable Ânanda said to the Blessed One: 'The venerable
Upâva*n*a has long

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

been in close personal attendance and service on the Blessed One. And
now, at the last moment, the Blessed One is not pleased with Upâva*n*a,
and has said to him, "Stand aside, O brother, stand not in front of me!"
What may be the cause and what the reason that the Blessed One is not
pleased with Upâva*n*a, and speaks thus with him?'

10\. 'In great numbers, Ânanda, are the gods of the ten world-systems
assembled together to behold the Tathâgata. For twelve leagues, Ânanda,
around the Sâla Grove of the Mallas, the Upavattana of Kusinârâ, there
is no spot in size even as the pricking of the point of the tip of a
hair which is not pervaded by powerful spirits\[1\]. And the spirits,
Ânanda, are murmuring, and say, "From afar have we come to behold the
Tathâgata. Few and far between are the Tathâgatas, the Arahat Buddhas
who appear in the world: and now to-day, in the last watch of the night,
the death of a Tathâgata will take place; and this eminent brother
stands in

\[1. Buddhaghosa explains that even twenty to sixty angels or gods
(devatâyo) could stand âragga-ko*t*i-nittûdana- (MS. nittaddana-) matte
pi, 'on a point pricked by the extreme point of a gimlet,' without
inconveniencing one another (a*ññ*am a*ññ*am avyâbâdhenti). It is most
curious to find this exact analogy to the notorious discussion as to how
many angels could stand on the point of a needle in a commentary written
at just that period of Buddhist history which corresponds to the Middle
Ages of Christendom. The passage in the text does not really imply or
suggest any such doctrine, though the whole episode is so absurd that
the author of the text could not have hesitated to say so, had such an
idea been the common belief of the early Buddhists. With these sections
should be compared the similar sections in Chapter VI, of which these
are perhaps merely an echo.

There is no comment on nittûdana, but there can be little doubt that
Childers's conjectural reading is correct.\]

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

front of the Tathâgata, concealing him, and in his last hour we are
prevented from beholding the Tathâgata;" thus, Ânanda, do the spirits
murmur.'

11\. 'But of what kind of spirits is the Blessed One thinking?'

12\. 'There are spirits, Ânanda, in the sky, but of worldly mind, who
dishevel their hair and weep, who stretch forth their arms and weep, who
fall prostrate on the ground, and roll to and fro in anguish at the
thought: "Too soon will the Blessed One die! Too soon will the Happy One
pass away! Full soon will the Light of the world vanish away\[1\]!"

13\. 'There are spirits, too, Ânanda, on the earth, and of worldly mind,
who tear their hair and weep, who stretch forth their arms and weep, who
fall prostrate on the ground, and roll to and fro in anguish at the
thought: "Too soon will the Blessed One die! Too soon will the Happy One
pass away! Full soon will the Eye of the world disappear from sight!"

14\. 'But the spirits who are free from passion bear it, calm and
self-possessed, mindful of the saying which begins, "Impermanent indeed
are all component things. How then is it possible \[whereas anything
whatever, when born, brought into being, and

\[1. *K*akku*m*loke antaradhâyissati, on which there is no comment. It
is literally, 'the Eye in the world will vanish away,' where Eye is of
course used figuratively of that by the aid of which spiritual truths
can be perceived, corresponding exactly to the similar use in Europe of
the word Light. The Master is often called *K*akkhumâ, 'He with the
Eye,' 'He of the spiritual Eye' (see, for instance, the last verses in
this Sutta), and here by a bold figure of speech he is called the Eye
itself, which was shortly about to vanish away from the world, the means
of spiritual insight which was no longer to be available for the common
use of all men. But this is, it will be noticed, only the lament of the
foolish and ignorant.\]

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

organised, contains within itself the inherent necessity of
dissolution--how then is it possible that such a being should not be
dissolved? No such condition can exist!"\]

\[1\]

15\. 'In times past, Lord, the brethren, when they had spent the rainy
season in different districts, used to come to see the Tathâgata, and we
used to receive those very reverend brethren to audience, and to wait
upon the Blessed One. But, Lord, after the end of the Blessed One, we
shall not be able to receive those very reverend brethren to audience,
and to wait upon the Blessed One.'

------------------------

16\. 'There are these four places, Ânanda, which the believing man
should visit with feelings of reverence and awe. Which are the four?

17\. 'The place, Ânanda, at which the believing man can say, "Here the
Tathâgata was born!" is a spot to be visited with feelings of reverence
and awe.

18\. 'The place, Ânanda, at which the believing man can say, "Here the
Tathâgata, attained to the supreme and perfect insight!" is a spot to be
visited with feelings of reverence and awe.

19\. 'The place, Ânanda, at which the believing man can say, "Here was
the kingdom of righteousness set on foot by the Tathâgata!" is a spot to
be visited with feelings of reverence and awe.

20\. 'The place, Ânanda, at which the believing man can say, "Here the
Tathâgata passed finally away in that utter passing away which leaves
nothing whatever to remain behind!" is a spot to be visited with
feelings of reverence and awe.

\[1. The words in brackets have been inserted from par. III, 63 above.
See par. VI, 39 below.\]

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

21\. 'And there will come, Ânanda, to such spots, believers, brethren
and sisters of the order. or devout men and devout women, and will say,
"Here was the Tathâgata born!" or, "Here did the Tathâgata attain to the
supreme and perfect insight!" or, "Here was the kingdom of righteousness
set on foot by the Tathâgata!" or, "Here the Tathâgata passed away in
that utter passing away which leaves nothing whatever to remain behind!"

22\. 'And they, Ânanda, who shall die while they, with believing heart,
are journeying on such pilgrimage, shall be reborn after death, when the
body shall dissolve, in the happy realms of heaven.'

------------------------

23\. 'How are we to conduct ourselves, Lord, with regard to womankind?'

'Don't see them, Ânanda.'

'But if we should see them, what are we to do?'

'Abstain from speech, Ânanda.'

'But if they should speak to us, Lord, what are we to do?'

'Keep wide awake, Ânanda.'

------------------------

24\. 'What are we to do, Lord, with the remains of the Tathâgata?'

'Hinder not yourselves, Ânanda, by honouring the remains of the
Tathâgata. Be zealous, I beseech you, Ânanda, in your own behalf! Devote
yourselves to your own good! Be earnest, be zealous, be intent on your
own good! There are wise men, Ânanda, among the nobles, among the
Brâhmans, among the heads of houses, who are firm believers in the
Tathâgata; and they will do due honour to the remains of the Tathâgata.'

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

25.<sup>\[1\]</sup> 'What should be done, Lord, with the remains of the
Tathâgata?'

'As men treat the remains of a king of kings, so, Ânanda, should they
treat the remains of a Tathâgata.'

'And how, Lord, do they treat the remains of a king of kings\[2\]?'

26\. 'They wrap the body of a king of kings, Ânanda, in a new cloth.
When that is done they wrap it in carded cotton wool\[3\]. When that is
done they wrap it in a new cloth,--and so on till they have wrapped the
body in five hundred successive layers of both kinds. Then they place
the body in an oil vessel of iron\[4\], and cover that close up with
another

\[1. This conversation occurs also below (VI, 33), and the older
tradition probably had it only in that connection.

2\. King of kings is an inadequate rendering of *K*akkavatti Râ*g*â. It
is a king whose power no other king can dispute, who is the acknowledged
overlord in India. The idea can scarcely have existed before
*K*andragupta, the first *K*akravarti, had raised himself to power. This
passage, therefore, is a guide to the date at which the Mahâ-parinibbâna
Sutta assumed its present form.

3\. 'Vihatena kappâsenâ ti supho*t*itena kappâsenâ: Kâsika-vattha*m* hi
sukhumattâ tela*m* na ga*n*hati, tasmâ vihatena kappâsenâ ti âha. 'As
Benâres cloth, by reason of its fineness of texture, does not take the
oil, he therefore says, "with vihata cotton wool," that is, with cotton
wool that has been well forced asunder.' That pho*t*ita is here the
participle of the causal verb, and not of the simple verb, follows of
necessity from its being used as an explanation of vihata, 'torn to
pieces.' The technical use of the word, as applied to cotton wool, has
only been found in this passage. It usually means 'torn with grief.'

4\. Ayasâya tela-do*n*iyâ, where one would expect âyasâya, but my MS. of
the Dîgha Nikâya confirms twice over here, and twice again below, § VI,
33, 35, the reading given by Childers. Buddhaghosa says, Âyasan ti
suva*nn*a*m*, suva*nn*amhi idha âyasan ti adhippeto, but here again we
should expect the second time to find ayo or ayasa*m*. The meaning of
the word is also not {footnote p. 93} quite clear. It no doubt was
origin ally used for bronze, and only later for iron also, and at last
exclusively of iron. As ka*m*sa is already a common word for bronze in
very early Buddhist Pâli texts, I think âyasa or ayasa must here mean
'of iron.' When Buddhaghosa says it is here a name for gold, we can only
conclude that iron had become, in his time, a metal which he might
fairly consider too base for the purpose proposed.\]

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

oil vessel of iron\[1\]. They then build a funeral pile of all kinds of
perfumes, and burn the body of the king of kings. And then at the four
cross roads they erect a dâgaba\[2\] to the king of kings. This, Ânanda,
is the way in which they treat the remains of a king of kings.

'And as they treat the remains of a king of kings, so, Ânanda, should
they treat the remains of the Tathâgata. At the four cross roads a
dâgaba should be erected to the Tathâgata. And whosoever shall there
place garlands or perfumes or paint, or make salutation there, or become
in its presence calm in heart--that shall long be to them for a profit
and a joy.'

------------------------

27\. 'These men, Ânanda, worthy of a dâgaba\[2\], are four in number.
Which are the four?

'A Tathâgata, or Arahat-Buddha, is worthy of a dâgaba. A
Pa*kk*eka-Buddha is worthy of a dâgaba\[3\].

\[1. Buddhaghosa has no note on pa*t*iku*gg*etvâ; but from its use at
*G*âtaka I, 50, 29: 69, 23, it must, I think, have this meaning. I am
not certain to what root it ought to be referred. I should mention that
pakkhipati seems to me never to mean in Pâli, 'to hurl forth into, to
throw forth,' but always 'to place (slowly and carefully) into.'

2\. A solid mound or tumulus, in the midst of which the bones and ashes
are to be placed. The dome of St. Paul's as seen from the Thames
Embankment gives a very good idea of one of the later Buddhist dâgabas.
The Pâli word here and below is Thûpa.

3\. A Pa*kk*eka-Buddha, who has attained to the supreme and perfect
insight; but dies without proclaiming the truth to the world.\]

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

A true hearer of the Tathâgata is worthy of a dâgaba. A king of kings is
worthy of a dâgaba.

28\. 'And on account of what circumstance, Ânanda, is a Tathâgata, an
Arahat-Buddha, worthy of a dâgaba?

'At the thought, Ânanda, "This is the dâgaba of that Blessed One, of
that Arahat-Buddha," the hearts of many shall be made calm and happy;
and since they there had calmed and satisfied their hearts they will be
reborn after death, when the body has dissolved, in the happy realms of
heaven. It is on account of this circumstance, Ânanda, that a Tathâgata,
an Arahat-Buddha, is worthy of a dâgaba.

29\. 'And on account of what circumstance, Ânanda, is a Pa*kk*eka-Buddha
worthy of a dâgaba?

'At the thought, Ânanda, "This is the dâgaba of that Blessed One, of
that Pa*kk*eka-Buddha," the hearts of many shall be made calm and happy;
and since they there had calmed and satisfied their hearts they will be
reborn after death, when the body has dissolved, in the happy realms of
heaven. It is on account of this circumstance, Ânanda, that a
Pa*kk*eka-Buddha is worthy of a dâgaba.

30\. 'And on account of what circumstance, Ânanda, is a true hearer of
the Blessed One, the Arahat-Buddha, worthy of a dâgaba?

'At the thought, Ânanda, "This is the dâgaba of that true hearer of the
Blessed Arahat-Buddha," the hearts of many shall be made calm and happy;
and since they there had calmed and satisfied their hearts they will be
reborn after death, when the body has dissolved, in the happy realms of
heaven. It is on account of this circumstance, Ânanda, that a true

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

hearer of the Blessed One, the Arahat-Buddha, is worthy of a dâgaba.

31\. 'And on account of what circumstance, Ânanda, is a king of kings
worthy of a dâgaba?

'At the thought, Ânanda, "This is the dâgaba of that righteous king who
ruled in righteousness," the hearts of many shall be made calm and
happy; and since they there had calmed and satisfied their hearts they
will be reborn after death, when the body has dissolved, in the happy
realms of heaven. It is on account of this circumstance, Ânanda, that a
king of kings is worthy of a dâgaba.

'These four, Ânanda, are the persons worthy of a dâgaba.'

------------------------

32\. 'Now the venerable Ânanda went into the Vihâra, and stood leaning
against the lintel of the door\[1\], and weeping at the thought: "Alas!
I remain still but a learner, one who has yet to work out his own
perfection\[2\]. And the Master is about to pass away from me--he who is
so kind!"'

33\. Now the Blessed One called the brethren, and said: 'Where, then,
brethren, is Ânanda?'

The venerable Ânanda, Lord, has gone into the

\[1. Kapisîsa*m*. Buddhaghosa says, Kapisîsakan ti
dvâra-bâha-ko*t*iya*m* *th*itam aggala-rukkha*m*,' a piece of wood fixed
as a bolt at the top of the door posts.' The Sanskrit lexicographers
give kapi-*s*îrsha in the sense of 'coping of a wall.' Compare
Pâtimokkha, Pâ*k*ittiya, No. 19.

The expression that Ânanda went 'into the Vihâra' at the end of a
conversation represented as having taken place in the Sâla Grove, would
seem to point to the fact that this episode originally stood in some
other connection. Buddhaghosa attempts to explain away the discrepancy
by saying that Vihâra here means Ma*nd*ala.

2 Ânanda had entered the Noble Path, but had not yet reached the end of
it. He had not attained to Nirvâ*n*a.\]

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

Vihâra, and stands leaning against the lintel of the door, and weeping
at the thought: 'Alas! I remain still but a learner, one who has yet to
work out his own perfection. And the Master is about to pass away from
me--he who is so kind!'

34\. And the Blessed One called a certain brother, and said: 'Go now,
brother, and call Ânanda in my name, and say, "Brother Ânanda, the
Master calls for thee."'

'Even so, Lord!' said that brother, in assent, to the Blessed One. And
he went up to the place where the Blessed One was; and when he had come
there, he said to the venerable Ânanda Brother Ânanda, the Master calls
for thee.'

'Very well, brother,' said the venerable Ânanda, in assent, to that
brother. And he went up to the place where the Blessed One was, and when
he had come there, he bowed down before the Blessed One, and took his
seat respectfully on one side.

35\. Then the Blessed One said to the venerable Ânanda, as he sat there
by his side: 'Enough, Ânanda! Do not let yourself be troubled; do not
weep! Have I not already, on former occasions, told you that it is in
the very nature of all things most near and dear unto us that we must
divide ourselves from them, leave them, sever ourselves from them? How,
then, Ânanda, can this be possible--whereas anything whatever born,
brought into being, and organised, contains within itself the inherent
necessity of dissolution--how, then, can this be possible, that such a
being should not be dissolved? No such condition can exist! For a long
time, Ânanda, have you been very near to me by acts of love, kind and
good, that never varies, and is beyond all

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

measure. For a long time, Ânanda, have you been very near to me by words
of love, kind and good, that never varies, and is beyond all measure.
For a long time, Ânanda, have you been very near to me by thoughts of
love, kind and good, that never varies\[1\], and is beyond all measure.
You have done well, Ânanda! Be earnest in effort, and you too shall soon
be free from the great evils-from sensuality, from individuality, from
delusion, and from ignorance\[2\]!'

------------------------

36.<sup>\[3\]</sup> Then the Blessed One addressed the brethren, and
said: 'Whosoever, brethren, have been Arahat-Buddhas through the long
ages of the past, there were servitors just as devoted to those Blessed
Ones as Ânanda has been to me. And whosoever, brethren, shall be
Arahat-Buddhas in the long ages of the future, there shall be servitors
just as devoted to those Blessed Ones as Ânanda has been to me.

37\. 'He is a wise man, brethren,--is Ânanda.

\[1. Advayena, which Buddhaghosa explains as not being that kind of love
which is now one thing and now another, or which varies in the presence
or the absence of the object loved. When the Buddha is called in the
Amara Kosha I, 1, 1, 9, advayavâdin, that must mean in a similar way,
'One whose teaching does not vary.'

2\. Literally, thou shalt become an Anâsava, that is, one who is free
from the four Âsavas, all which are explained above in § I, 12, from
which I have taken the details suggested to a Buddhist by the word used.
The state of mind to which an Anâsava has reached is precisely the same,
though looked at from a different point of view, as the state of mind
expressed by the better known word Nirvâ*n*a.

3\. What follows is repeated in the Satipatthâ*n*a Vagga of the
Sa*m*yutta Nikâya; but in regard to Sâriputta (Upatissa) and Moggallâna,
and reading sâvaka-yuga*m* for upâ*tth*âko.\]

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span> He knows when it is the right time for
him to come and visit the Tathâgata, and when it is the right time for
the brethren and sisters of the order, for devout men and devout women,
for a king, or for a king's ministers, for other teachers or their
disciples, to come and visit the Tathâgata.

38\. 'Brethren, there are these four wonderful and marvellous qualities
in Ânanda. Which are the four?

'If, brethren, a number of the brethren of the order should come to
visit Ânanda, they are filled with joy on beholding him; and if Ânanda
should then preach the truth to them, they are filled with joy at the
discourse; while the company of brethren is ill at ease, brethren, when
Ânanda is silent.

'If, brethren, a number of the sisters of the order, or of devout men,
or of devout women, should come to visit Ânanda, they are filled with
joy on beholding him; and if Ânanda should then preach the truth to
them, they are filled with joy at the discourse; while the company of
sisters is ill at ease, brethren, when Ânanda is silent.

39\. 'Brethren, there are these four wonderful and marvellous qualities
in a king of kings. What are the four?

'If, brethren, a number of nobles, or Brâhman, or heads of houses, or
Samanas should come to visit a king of kings, they are filled with joy
on beholding him; and if the king of kings should then speak, they are
filled with joy at what is said; while they are ill at case, brethren,
when the king of kings is silent.

40\. 'Just so, brethren, are the four wonderful and marvellous qualities
in Ânanda.

'If, brethren, a number of the brethren of the

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

order, or of the sisters of the order, or of devout men, or of devout
women, should come to visit Ânanda, they are filled with joy on
beholding him; and if Ânanda should then preach the truth to them, they
are filled with joy at the discourse; while the company of brethren is
ill at case, brethren, when Ânanda is silent.

'Now these, brethren, are the four wonderful and marvellous qualities
that are in Ânanda.'

------------------------

41\. When he had thus spoken\[1\], the venerable Ânanda said to the
Blessed One:

'Let not the Blessed One die in this little wattel and daub town, in
this town in the midst of the jungle, in this branch township\[2\]. For,
Lord, there are other great cities, such as *K*ampâ, Râ*g*agaha,
Sâvatthi, Sâketa, Kosambi, and Benâres. Let the Blessed One die in one
of them. There there are many wealthy nobles and Brâhmans and heads of
houses, believers in the Tathâgata, who will pay due honour to the
remains of the Tathâgata\[3\].'

\[1. From here down to the end of section 44 is found also, nearly word
for word, in the beginning of the Mahâ-Sudassana Sutta, translated
below; compare also Mahâ-Sudassana *G*âtaka, No. 95.

2 Ku*dd*a-nagarake ti pa*t*irûpake sambâdhe khuddakanagare:
Ugga<u>n</u>gala-nagarake ti visama-nagarake. (S.V. fol. *th*au.)
Ku*dd*a, if this explanation be right, seems to be merely an old and
unusual form for kshudra, and the Burmese correction into khudda to be
unnecessary: but I venture to think it is more likely to be = ku*d*ya,
and to mean a wall built of mud and sticks, or what is called in India,
of wattel and daub. When Buddhaghosa explains u*gg*a<u>n</u>gala as
'lawless,' he is expressing his view that a town in the jungle is likely
to be a heathen, pagan sort of place.

3 With reference to Childers's note in his Dictionary on mahâsâlâ, with
which every one must entirely agree, Buddhaghosa's {footnote p. 100}
explanation of the word will be interesting as a proof (if proof be
needed) that the Ceylon scholars are not always trustworthy. He says,
Khattiya-mahâsâlâ ti khattiya-mahâsârâ sârapattâ mahâ-khattiyâ. Eso nayo
sabbattha.\]

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

42\. 'Say not so, Ânanda! Say not so, Ânanda, that this is but a small
wattel and daub town, a town in the midst of the jungle, a branch
township. Long ago, Ânanda, there was a king, by name Mahâ-Sudassana, a
king of kings, a righteous man who ruled in righteousness, Lord of the
four quarters of the earth, conqueror, the protector of his people,
possessor of the seven royal treasures. This Kusinârâ, Ânanda, was the
royal city of king Mahâ-Sudassana, under the name of Kusâvatî, and on
the east and on the west it was twelve leagues in length, and on the
north and on the south it was seven leagues in breadth.

43\. 'That royal city Kusâvatî, Ânanda, was mighty, and prosperous, and
full of people, crowded with men, and provided with all things for
food\[1\]. Just, Ânanda, as the royal city of the gods, Â*l*akamandâ by
name, is mighty, prosperous, and full of people, crowded with the gods,
and provided with all kinds of food, so, Ânanda, was the royal city
Kusâvatî mighty and prosperous, full of people, crowded with men, and
provided with all kinds of food.

44\. 'Both by day and by night, Ânanda, the royal city Kusâvatî
resounded with the ten cries; that is to say, the noise of elephants,
and the noise of horses, and the noise of chariots; the sounds of the

\[1. The first three of these adjectives are applied at *G*âtaka I, 29
(v. 212) to the religion of the Buddhas; and I think the right reading
there must be phîta*m*, in accordance with the corrections in two MSS.
as noted by Mr. Fausböll, and not pîta*m* as he has preferred to read.
The whole set of epithets is often used of cities.\]

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

drum, of the tabor, and of the lute; the sound of singing, and the
sounds of the cymbal and of the gong; and lastly, with the cry, "Eat,
drink, and be merry\[1\]!"

------------------------

45\. 'Go now, Ânanda, and enter into Kusinârâ, and inform the Mallas of
Kusinârâ, saying, "This day, O Vâse*tth*as, in the last watch of the
night, the final passing away of the Tathâgata will take place. Be
favourable herein, O Vâse*tth*as, be favourable. Give no occasion to
reproach yourselves hereafter, saying, 'In our own village did the death
of our Tathâgata take place, and we took not the opportunity of visiting
the Tathâgata in his last hours.'"'

'Even so, Lord,' said the venerable Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed
One; and he robed himself, and taking his bowl\[2\], entered into
Kusinârâ attended by another member of the order.

\[1. This enumeration is found also at *G*âtaka, p. 3, only that the
conch shell is added there-wrongly, for that makes the number of cries
eleven. The Mahâ-Sudassana Sutta has in the corresponding passage, like
the Burmese MS. noted here by Childers, conch instead of cymbal. My MS.
reads cymbal here.

2\. Nivâsetvâ patta-*k*îvara*m* âdâya atta-dutiyo. Buddhaghosa has,
naturally enough, no comment on this oft-recurring phrase. It cannot be
meant that he put on only his under-garments, and carried his upper robe
with him; for then his shoulders would have been bare; and it is quite
against the rules to go into a village without all the robes having been
put carefully on (Pâtimokkha, Sekhiya 1-3). I do not even understand how
Ânanda, with due regard to the rules of the brotherhood (see Pâtimokkha,
Nisaggiya 21-29), could have had a spare robe then with him. And
patta-*k*îvaram can scarcely mean simply 'bowl-robe,' referring to the
length of cotton cloth in which the bowl was carried over the shoulder
('Buddhist Birth Stories,' p. 71). 'With both his under-garments on, he
entered Kusinârâ duly bowled and robed' may be impossible English, but
it probably correctly catches the {footnote p. 102} idea involved,
though of course one (at least) of the under-cloths had been put on long
before. See p. 122. A Thera never goes about in public alone, he is
always accompanied by a Sâma*n*era.\]

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

46\. Now at that time the Mallas of Kusinârâ were assembled in the
council hall on some public affair\[1\].

And the venerable Ânanda went to the council hall of the Mallas of
Kusinârâ; and when he had arrived there, he informed them, saying, 'This
day, O Vâse*tth*as, in the last watch of the night, the final passing
away of the Tathâgata will take place. Be favourable herein, O
Vâse*tth*as, be favourable. Give no occasion to reproach yourselves
hereafter, saying, "In our own village did the death of our Tathâgata
take place, and we took not the opportunity of visiting the Tathâgata in
his last hours."'

47\. And when they had heard this saying of the venerable Ânanda, the
Mallas with their young men and maidens and their wives were grieved,
and sad, and afflicted at heart. And some of them wept, dishevelling
their hair, and stretched forth their arms and wept, fell prostrate on
the ground, and rolled to and fro in anguish at the thought: 'Too soon
will the Blessed One die! Too soon will the Happy One pass away! Full
soon will the Light of the world vanish away!'

------------------------

48\. Then the Mallas, with their young men and

\[1. Ke na*k*id eva kara*n*îyena. Professor Pischel, in his edition of
the Assalâyana Sutta (p. 1), prints this expression kena*k*i
devakara*n*îyena, and translates it (p. 28), 'for some religious
purposes.' It seems to me that he has been misled by the commentary,
which really presupposes the more correct division adopted by
Childers.\]

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

maidens and their wives, being grieved and sad and afflicted at heart,
went to the Sâla Grove of the Mallas, to the Upavattana, and to the
place where the venerable Ânanda was.

49\. Then the venerable Ânanda thought: 'If I allow the Mallas of
Kusinârâ, one by one, to pay their respects to the Blessed One, the
whole of the Mallas of Kusinârâ will not have been presented to the
Blessed One until this night brightens up into the dawn. Let me, now,
cause the Mallas of Kusinârâ to stand in groups, each family in a group,
and so present them to the Blessed One, saying, "Lord! a Malla of such
and such a name, with his children, his wives, his retinue, and his
friends, humbly bows down at the feet of the Blessed One."'

50\. And the venerable Ânanda caused the Mallas of Kusinârâ to stand in
groups, each family in a group, and so presented them to the Blessed
One, and said: 'Lord! a Malla of such and such a name, with his
children, his wives, his retinue, and his friends, humbly bows down at
the feet of the Blessed One.'

51\. And after this manner the venerable Ânanda presented all the Mallas
of Kusinârâ to the Blessed One in the first watch of the night.

------------------------

52\. Now at that time a mendicant named Subhadda, who was not a
believer, was dwelling at Kusinârâ. And the mendicant Subhadda heard the
news: 'This very day, they say, in the third watch of the night, will
take place the final passing away of the Sama*n*a Gotama.'

53\. Then thought the mendicant Subhadda: 'This have I heard from fellow
mendicants of mine, old and well stricken in years, teachers and

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

disciples, when they said: "Sometimes and full seldom do Tathâgatas
appear in the world, the Arahat Buddhas." Yet this day, in the last
watch of the night, the final passing away of the Sama*n*a Gotama will
take place. Now a certain feeling of uncertainty has sprung up in my
mind; and this faith have I in the Sama*n*a Gotama, that he, methinks,
is able so to present the truth that I may get rid of this feeling of
uncertainty.'

54\. Then the mendicant Subhadda went to the Sâla Grove of the Mallas,
to the Upavattana of Kusinârâ, to the place where the venerable Ânanda
was.

55\. And when he had come there he said to the venerable Ânanda: 'Thus
have I heard from fellow mendicants of mine, old and well stricken in
years, teachers and disciples, when they said: "Sometimes and full
seldom do Tathâgatas appear in the world, the Arahat Buddhas." Yet this
day, in the last watch of the night, the final passing away of the
Sama*n*a Gotama will take place. Now a certain feeling of uncertainty
has sprung up in my mind; and this faith have I in the Sama*n*a Gotama,
that he, methinks, is able so to present the truth that I may get rid of
this feeling of uncertainty. O that I, even I, Ânanda, might be allowed
to see the Sama*n*a Gotama!'

56\. And when he had thus spoken the venerable Ânanda said to the
mendicant Subhadda: 'Enough! friend Subhadda. Trouble not the Tathâgata.
The Blessed One is weary.'

57\. And again the mendicant Subhadda \[made the same request in the
same words, and received the same reply\]; and the third time the
mendicant Subhadda \[made the same request in the same words, and
received the same reply\]

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

58\. Now the Blessed One overheard this conversation of the venerable
Ânanda with the mendicant Subhadda. And the Blessed One called the
venerable Ânanda, and said: 'It is enough, Ânanda! Do not keep out
Subhadda. Subhadda, Ânanda, may be allowed to see the Tathâgata.
Whatever Subhadda may ask of me, he will ask from a desire for
knowledge, and not to annoy me. And whatever I may say in answer to his
questions, that he will quickly understand.'

59\. Then the venerable Ânanda said to Subhadda, the mendicant: 'Enter
in, friend Subhadda; for the Blessed One gives you leave.'

60\. Then Subhadda, the mendicant, went in to the place where the
Blessed One was, and saluted him courteously, and after exchanging with
him the compliments of esteem and of civility, he took his seat on one
side. And when he was thus seated, Subhadda, the mendicant, said to the
Blessed One: 'The Brâhmans by saintliness of life\[1\], Gotama, who

\[1. Sama*n*a-brâhma*n*â, which compound may possibly mean Samanas and
Brahmans as it has usually been rendered, but I think not necessarily.
Not one of those here specified were Brâhmans by caste, as is apparent
from the Sumangala Vilâsinî on the Sâma*ññ*a Phala Sutta, p. 114.
Compare the use of Kshatriya-brâhma*n*o, 'a soldier priest,' a Kshatriya
who offered sacrifice; and of Brâhma*n*o, absolutely, as an epithet of
an Arahat. In the use of the word sama*n*a there seems to me to be a
hopeless confusion between, a complete mingling of the meanings of, the
two roots *s*ram and *s*am (which, in Pâli, would both become sam). It
connotes both asceticism and inward peace, and might best be rendered
'devotee,' were it not for the intellectual inferiority implied by that
word in our language. A Sama*n*a Brâhman should therefore mean a man of
any caste, who by his saintliness of life, by his renunciation of the
world, and by his reputation as a religious thinker, had acquired the
position of a quasi Brâhman, and {footnote p. 106} was looked up to by
the people in the same way as that in which they looked up to a Brâhman
by caste. Compare further my 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' vol. i. p. 260;
and also Mr. Beal's remarks in the Indian Antiquary for May, 1880; and
Professor Max Müller's note on Dhammapada, verse 265.\]

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

are heads of companies of disciples and students, teachers of students,
well known, renowned, founders of schools of doctrine, esteemed as good
men by the multitude--to wit, Pûra*n*a Kassapa, Makkhali of the
cattle-pen, A*g*ita of the garment of hair, Ka*kk*âyana of the Pakudha
tree, Sa*ñg*aya the son of the Bela*tth*i slave-girl, and Niga*nth*a of
the Nâtha clan--have they all, according to their own assertion,
thoroughly understood things? or have they not? or are there some of
them who have understood, and some who have not\[1\]?'

61\. 'Enough, Subhadda! Let this matter rest whether they, according to
their own assertion, have thoroughly understood things, or whether they
have not, or whether some of them have understood and some have not! The
truth, Ânanda, will I teach you. Listen well to that, and give ear
attentively, and I will speak.'

'Even so, Lord!' said the mendicant Subhadda, in assent, to the Blessed
One.

62\. And the Blessed One spake: 'In whatsoever doctrine and discipline,
Subhadda, the noble eightfold path is not found, neither in it is there
found a man of true saintliness of the first or of the second or of the
third or of the fourth degree\[2\].

\[1. Buddhaghosa has an exegetical note on abbha*ññ*amsu, but passes
over those celebrated Six Teachers in silence. The little that is thus
far known of them will be discussed in another place.

2\. This refers to the four divisions of the Noble Eightfold Path. See
above, chap. II, § 8, where their characters are described. The
{footnote p. 107} word translated 'man of true saintliness,' or 'true
saint,' is in the text Sama*n*o, on which see the note on page 105. I am
at a loss how to render the word adequately here.\]

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span> And in whatsoever doctrine and
discipline, Subhadda, the noble eightfold path is found, is found the
man of true saintliness of the first and the second and the third and
the fourth degree. Now in this doctrine and discipline, Subhadda, is
found the noble eightfold path, and in it alone, Subhadda, is the man of
true saintliness. Void are the systems of other teachers--void of true
saints. And in this one, Subhadda, may the brethren live the Life that's
Right, so that the world be not bereft of Arahats\[1\].

\[1. Arahats are those who have reached Nirvâ*n*a, the 'supreme goal,'
the 'highest fruit' of the Noble Eightfold Path. To live 'the Life
that's Right' (sammâ) is to live in the Noble Path, each of the eight
divisions of which is to be sammâ, round, right and perfect, normal and
complete. To live right (sammâ) is therefore to have--1. Right views,
free from superstition. 2. Right aims, high and worthy of the
intelligent and earnest man. 3. Right speech, kindly, open, truthful. 4.
Right conduct, in all concerns of life. 5. Right livelihood, bringing
hurt or danger to no living thing. 6. Right perseverance, in all the
other seven. 7. Right mindfulness, the watchful, active mind. 8. Right
contemplation, earnest thought on the deep mysteries of life. In each of
these the word right is sammâ, and the whole paragraph being on the
Noble Path, the allusion is certainly to this central doctrine of the
Buddhist Dhamma.

Buddhaghosa says that that bhikkhu sammâ viharati, who, having himself
entered the Noble Path, leads his brother into it, and this is, no
doubt, good Buddhism. But it is a practical application of the text, a
theological exegesis, and not a philological explanation. Even so it
seems to lay the stress too much on 'bereft,' and too little on
'Arahats.'

In the last words of the prose we seem to have a reminiscence of what
were once verses, which may have run-

Su*ññ*â pavâdâ sama*n*ehi a*ññ*e; {footnote p. 108}  
Ime ka sammâ vihareyyu bhikkhû,  
Asu*ññ*o loko 'rahatehi assa.

\]

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

'But twenty-nine was I when I renounced  
The world, Subhadda, seeking after good.  
For fifty years and one year more, Subhadda,  
Since I went out, a pilgrim have I been  
Through the wide realms of virtue and of truth,  
And outside these no really "saint" can be\[1\]!"

Yea, not of the first, nor of the second, nor of the third, nor of the
fourth degree. Void are the systems of other teachers--void of true
saints. But in this one, Subhadda, may the brethren live the perfect
life, that the world be not bereft of those who have reached the highest
fruit.'

63\. And when he had thus spoken, Subhadda, the mendicant, said to the
Blessed One: 'Most excellent, Lord, are the words of thy mouth, most
excellent! just as if a man were to set up that which is thrown down, or
were to reveal that which is hidden away, or were to point out the right
road to him who has gone astray, or were to bring a lamp into the
darkness, so that those who have eyes can see external forms;--just even
so, Lord, has the truth been made known to me, in many a figure, by the
Blessed One. And I, even I, betake myself, Lord, to the Blessed One as
my refuge, to the truth, and to the order. May the Blessed One accept me
as a disciple, as a true believer, from this day forth, as long as life
endures!'

\[1. I have followed, though with some doubt, Childers's punctuation.
Buddhaghosa refers padesa-vattî to sama*n*o; and ito, not to padesa, but
to magga, understood; and it is quite possible that this is the correct
explanation. On samâdhikâni see the comment at *G*âtaka II, 383.\]

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

64\. 'Whosoever, Subhadda, that has formerly been a follower of another
doctrine and then desires to be received into the higher or the lower
grade in this doctrine and discipline, he remains on probation for the
space of four months; and at the end of the four months, the brethren,
exalted in spirit, receive him into the lower or into the higher grade
of the order. Nevertheless in this case I acknowledge the difference in
persons.'

65\. 'If, Lord, whosoever that has formerly been a follower of another
doctrine and then desires to be received into the higher or the lower
grade in this doctrine and discipline,--if, in that case, such a person
remains on probation for the space of four months; and at the end of the
four months, the brethren, exalted in spirit, receive him into the lower
or into the higher grade of the order--I too, then, will remain on
probation for the space of four months; and at the end of the four
months let the brethren, exalted in spirit, receive me into the lower or
into the higher grade of the order!'

66\. But the Blessed One called the venerable Ânanda, and said: 'As it
is, Ânanda, receive Subhadda into the order!'

'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable Ânanda, in assent, to the Blessed
One.

67\. And Subhadda, the mendicant, said to the venerable Ânanda: 'Great
is your gain, friend Ânanda, great is your good fortune, friend Ânanda,
that you all have been sprinkled with the sprinkling of discipleship in
this brotherhood at the hands of the Master himself!'

68\. So Subhadda, the mendicant, was received

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

into the higher grade of the order under the Blessed One; and from
immediately after his ordination the venerable Subhadda remained alone
and separate, earnest, zealous, and resolved. And e'er long he attained
to that supreme goal of the higher life\[1\] for the sake of which men
go out from all and every household gain and comfort to become houseless
wanderers--yea, that supreme goal did he, by himself, and while yet in
this visible world, bring himself to the knowledge of, and continue to
realise, and to see face to face! And he became conscious that birth was
at an end, that the higher life had been fulfilled, that all that should
be done had been accomplished, and that after this present life there
would be no beyond!

69\. So the venerable Subbadda became yet another among the Arahats; and
he was the last disciple whom the Blessed One himself converted\[2\].

------------------------

End of the Hira*ññ*avatiya portion, being the Fifth Portion for
Recitation.

\[1. That is, Nirvâ*n*a. Compare Ma<u>n</u>gala Sutta V, 11, and the
Dhammapada, verses 180, 354, and above Chap. I, § 7.

2 Buddhaghosa says that the last five words in the text (the last twelve
words in my translation) were added by the Theras who held the Council.
On Subhadda's ordination he has the following interesting note: 'The
Thero, (that is, Ânanda), they say, took him on one side, poured water
over his head from a water vessel, made him repeat the formula of
meditation on the impermanency of the
body(Ta*k*a-pa*ñk*aka-kamma*tth*ana*m*; see my "Buddhist Birth Stories,"
p. 161), shaved off his hair and beard, clad him in the yellow robes,
made him repeat the "Three Refuges," and led him back to the Blessed
One. The Blessed One himself admitted him then into the higher rank of
the brotherhood, and pointed out to him a subject for meditation
(kamma*tth*ana*m*; see "Buddhist {footnote p. 111} Birth Stories," p.
147). He accepted this, and walking up and down in a quiet part of the
grove, he thought and meditated upon it, till overcoming the Evil
Spirit, he had acquired Arahatship, and with it the discriminating
knowledge of all the Scriptures (Pa*t*isambhidâ). Then, returning, he
came and took his seat beside the Blessed One.'

According to this, no set ceremony for ordination
(Sa<u>n</u>gha-kamma*m*), as laid down in the Vinaya, took place; and it
is otherwise probable that no such ceremony was usual in the earliest
days of Buddhism.\]

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

### CHAPTER VI.

1\. Now the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ânanda, and said: 'It
may be, Ânanda, that in some of you the thought may arise, "The word of
the Master is ended, we have no teacher more!" But it is not thus,
Ânanda, that you should regard it. The truths and the rules of the order
which I have set forth and laid down for you all, let them, after I am
gone, be the Teacher to you.'

------------------------

2\. 'Ânanda! when I am gone address not one another in the way in which
the brethren have heretofore addressed each other--with the epithet,
that is, of "Âvuso" (Friend). A younger brother may be addressed by an
elder with his name, or his family name, or the title "Friend." But an
elder should be addressed by a younger brother as "Lord" or as
"Venerable Sir."

------------------------

3\. 'When I am gone, Ânanda, let the order, if it should so wish,
abolish all the lesser and minor precepts\[1\].'

------------------------

4\. 'When I am gone, Ânanda, let the higher penalty be imposed on
brother *Kh*anna.'

'But what, Lord, is the higher penalty?'

\[1. In Kulla Vagga XI, 1, 9, 10, is related how the brotherhood
formally considered the permission thus accorded to them, and resolved
to adhere to all the precepts as laid down in the Buddha's lifetime. In
his comment on this passage Buddhaghosa incidentally refers to a
conversation on the subject between Nâgasena and Milinda Râ*g*a, but
makes no mention of the work known as Milinda Pa*ñ*ha. Compare
Trenckner's edition of that work, p. 142.\]

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

'Let *Kh*anna say whatever he may like, Ânanda, the brethren should
neither speak to him, nor exhort him, nor admonish him\[1\].'

------------------------

5\. Then the Blessed One addressed the brethren, and said: 'It may be,
brethren, that there may be doubt or misgiving in the mind of some
brother as to the Buddha, or the truth, or the path, or the way.
Enquire, brethren, freely. Do not have to reproach yourselves afterwards
with the thought, "Our teacher was face to face with us, and we could
not bring ourselves to enquire of the Blessed One when we were face to
face with him."'

And when he had thus spoken the brethren were silent.

6\. And again the second and the third time the Blessed One addressed
the brethren, and said: 'It may be, brethren, that there may be doubt or
misgiving in the mind of some brother as to the Buddha, or the truth, or
the path, or the way. Enquire, brethren, freely. Do not have to reproach
yourselves afterwards with the thought, "Our teacher was face to face
with us, and we could not bring ourselves to enquire of the Blessed One
when we were face to face with him."'

And even the third time the brethren were silent.

\[1. Compare *K*ulla Vagga I, 25-31: IV, 14, 1: XI, 1, 12-14. *Kh*anna
is represented as an obstinate, perverse man; so destitute of the proper
'esprit de corps' that he dared to take part with the sisterhood, and
against the brotherhood, in a dispute which had arisen between them. But
after the social penalty here referred to had been duly imposed upon
him, even his proud and independent spirit was tamed; he became humble:
his eyes were opened; and he, also, attained to the 'supreme goal' of
the Buddhist faith.\]

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

7\. Then the Blessed One addressed the brethren, and said: 'It may be,
brethren, that you put no questions out of reverence for the teacher.
Let one friend communicate to another.'

And when he had thus spoken the brethren were silent.

8\. And the venerable Ânanda said to the Blessed One: 'How wonderful a
thing is it, Lord, and how marvellous! Verily, I believe that in this
whole assembly of the brethren there is not one brother who has any
doubt or misgiving as to the Buddha, or the truth, or the path, or the
way!'

9\. 'It is out of the fulness of faith that thou hast spoken, Ânanda!
But, Ânanda, the Tathâgata knows for certain that in this whole assembly
of the brethren there is not one brother who has any doubt or misgiving
as to the Buddha, or the truth, or the path, or the way! For even the
most backward, Ânanda, of all these five hundred brethren has become
converted, and is no longer liable to be born in a state of suffering,
and is assured of final salvation\[1\].'

------------------------

10\. Then the Blessed One addressed the brethren, and said, 'Behold now,
brethren, I exhort you, saying, "Decay is inherent in all component
things! Work out your salvation with diligence!"'

This was the last word of the Tathâgata!

------------------------

11\. Then the Blessed One entered into the first

\[1. Compare above, Chap. II, § 7. By 'the most backward,' according to
Buddhaghosa, the Blessed One referred to Ânanda, and he said this to
encourage him.\]

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

stage of deep meditation\[1\]. And rising out of the first stage he
passed into the second. And rising out of the second he passed into the
third. And rising out of the third stage he passed into the fourth. And
rising out of the fourth stage of deep meditation he entered into the
state of mind to which the infinity of space is alone present\[2\]. And
passing out of the mere consciousness of the infinity of space he
entered into the state of mind to which the infinity of thought is alone
present. And passing out of the mere consciousness of the infinity of
thought he entered into a state of mind to which nothing at all was
specially present. And passing out of the consciousness of no special
object he fell into a state between consciousness and unconsciousness.
And passing out of the state between consciousness and unconsciousness
he fell into a state in which the consciousness both of sensations and
of ideas had wholly passed away.

12\. Then the venerable Ânanda said to the venerable Anuruddha: 'O my
Lord, O Anuruddha, the Blessed One is dead!'

'Nay! brother Ânanda, the Blessed One is not dead. He has entered into
that state in which both sensations and ideas have ceased to be!'

13\. Then the Blessed One passing out of the state in which both
sensations and ideas have ceased to be, entered into the state between
consciousness and unconsciousness. And passing out of the state between
consciousness and unconsciousness he entered into the state of mind to

\[1. *Gh*âna, the full text and an explanation of which will be found in

which nothing at all Is specially present. And passing out of the
consciousness of no special object he entered into the state of mind to
which the infinity of thought is alone present. And passing out of the
mere consciousness of the infinity of thought he entered into the state
of mind to which the infinity of space is alone present. And passing out
of the mere consciousness of the infinity of space he entered into the
fourth stage of deep meditation. And passing out of the fourth stage he

14\. When the Blessed One died there arose, at the moment of his passing
out of existence, a mighty earthquake, terrible and awe-inspiring and
the thunders of heaven burst forth.

15\. When the Blessed One died, Brahmâ Sahampati, at the moment of his
passing away from existence, uttered this stanza:

'They all, all beings that have life, shall lay  
Aside their complex form--that aggregation  
Of mental and material qualities,  
That gives them, or in heaven or on earth,  
Their fleeting individuality!  
E'en as the teacher--being such a one, <span id="page_117">p.
117</span>  
Unequalled among all the men that are,  
Successor of the prophets of old time,  
Mighty by wisdom, and in insight clear--  
        Hath died\[1\]!'

16\. When the Blessed One died, Sakka, the king of the gods, at the
moment of his passing away from existence, uttered this stanza:

'They're transient all, each being's parts and powers,  
Growth is their nature, and decay.  
They are produced, they are dissolved again:  
And then is best, when they have sunk to rest\[2\]!'

\[1. Brahmâ, the first cause, the highest result of Indian theological
speculation, the one God of the Indian Pantheists, is represented as
using expressions full of deep allusions to the most characteristic
Buddhist doctrines. The Samussaya is the result of the temporary
collocation of the 'aggregations' (khandhâ) of mental and material
qualities which give to each being (bhûto, that is, man, animal, god,
ghost, fairy, or what not) its outward and visible shape, its
individuality. Loka is here not the world in our sense, but the
'locality' in the Buddhist universe which such an individual occupies
until it is dissolved. (Comp. Chap. II, §§ 14, 34.) Brahmâ appears
therefore as a veritable Vibha*gg*avâdî.

2\. On this celebrated verse see below the Introduction to
Mahâ-Sudassana Sutta. It must be the original of the first verse in the
Chinese work, Fa Kheu Pi Hu (Beal, Dhammapada, p. 32), though it is
there so changed that every clause has lost its point.

'Whatever exists is without endurance.  
And hence the terms "flourishing" and "decaying."  
A man is born, and then he dies.  
Oh, the happiness of escaping from this condition!'

The very meaning which is here the most essential connotation of
sa<u>n</u>khârâ is lost in the phrase 'whatever exists.' By a
misapprehension of the, no doubt, difficult word Dhamma, which, however,
never means 'term,' the second clause has lost its point. And by a
grammatical blunder the third clause in the Chinese confines the
doctrine, erroneously, to man. In a Chinese tale, called {footnote p.
118} Ngan shih niu, translated by Mr. Beal, in the Indian Antiquary for
May, 1880, the following verses occur; and they are possibly another
reflection of this stanza:

'All things that exist are transitory.  
They must of necessity perish and disappear;  
Though joined together, there must be separation;  
Where there is life there must be death.'

\]

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

17\. When the Blessed One died, the venerable Anuruddha, at the moment
of his passing away from existence, uttered these stanzas:

'When he who from all craving want was free,  
Who to Nirvâ*n*a's tranquil state had reached,  
When the great sage finished his span of life,  
No gasping struggle vexed that steadfast heart!

All resolute, and with unshaken mind,  
He calmly triumphed o'er the pain of death.  
E'en as a bright flame dies away, so was  
His last deliverance from the bonds of life\[1\]!'

18\. When the Blessed One died, the venerable Ânanda, at the moment of
his passing away from existence, uttered this stanza:

'Then was there terror!  
Then stood the hair on end!  
When he endowed with every grace--  
The supreme Buddha--died\[2\]!'

\[1. *K*etaso Vimokho. Kena*k*i dhammena anâvara*n*a-vimokho sabbaso
apa*ññ*atti-bhâvûpagamo, says Buddhaghosa; that is, 'the deliverance
which is free from the restraint of each and every mental quality
completely vanishing away' (dhammâ being here = sa*ññ*â and vedanâ and
sa<u>n</u>khârâ; see 'Buddhism,' pp. 91, 92). See also below, p. 153.

2\. In these four stanzas we seem to have the way in which the death of
the Buddha would be regarded, as the early Buddhist thought, by four
representative persons--the exalted God of the theologians; the Jupiter
of the multitude (allowing in the case of {footnote p. 119} each of
these for the change in character resulting from their conversion to
Buddhism); the holy, thoughtful Arahat; and the loving, childlike
disciple.\]

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

19<sup>\[1\]</sup>. When the Blessed One died, of those of the brethren
who were not yet free from the passions, some stretched out their arms
and wept, and some fell headlong on the ground, rolling to and fro in
anguish at the thought 'Too soon has the Blessed One died! Too soon has
the Happy One passed away from existence! Too soon has the Light gone
out in the world!'

But those of the brethren who were free from the passions (the Arahats)
bore their grief collected and composed at the thought 'Impermanent are
all component things! How is it possible that \[they should not be
dissolved\]?'

20\. Then the venerable Anuruddha exhorted the brethren, and said:
'Enough, my brethren! Weep not, neither lament! Has not the Blessed One
formerly declared this to us, that it is in the very nature of all
things near and dear unto us, that we must divide ourselves from them,
leave them, sever ourselves from them? How then, brethren, can this be
possible--that whereas anything whatever born, brought into being, and
organised, contains within itself the inherent necessity of
dissolution--how then can this be possible that such a being should not
be dissolved? No such condition can exist! Even the spirits, brethren,
will reproach us\[2\].'

\[1. Nearly = V, 11-14; and below, VI, 39.

2\. U*ggh*âyanti. I have followed the reading of my own MS., which is
confirmed by the Sumangala Vilâsinî and the Mâlâla<u>n</u>kâra-vatthu.
Vi*ggh*âyanti, which Childers reads, would be questionable Buddhism. The
spirits do not become extinct; that is, not as a general rule, as would
be implied by the absolute statement, {footnote p. 120} 'Even the
spirits, brethren, become extinct.' It is no doubt true that all
spirits, from the lowest to the highest, from the most insignificant
fairy to the God of theological speculation, are regarded as temporary.
But when they cease to exist as gods or spirits (devatâ), they do not go
out, they are not extinguished (vi*ggh*âyanti); they continue to exist
in some other form. And though that other form would, from the European
point of view, be a different being, as there would be no continuity of
consciousness, no passage of a 'soul' from the one to the other; it
would, from the Buddhist point of view, be the same being, as it would
be the resultant effect of the same Karma. There would follow on the
death of a devatâ, not extinction, but a transmutation of force, a
transmigration of character, a passing on, an inheritance of Karma. Only
in the exceedingly rare case of an anâgâmin, of which an instance will
be found above, Chap. II, § 7, could it be said that a spirit becomes
extinct.

The expression 'of worldly mind,' here and above in V, 11, is in Pâli
pa*th*avi-sa*ññ*iniyo, an ambiguous phrase which has only been found in
this connection. Buddhaghosa says merely, 'because they made (mâpetvâ)
an earth in heaven.' This gloss again may be taken either in a
figurative or in a literal sense; but, if not impossible, it is at least
unlikely that the good commentator means calmly to state that the angels
created a floor in the skies--for the greater convenience of tumbling!
The word seems to me also to be opposed to vitarâgâ, 'free from
passion,' and I have therefore taken it in a spiritual sense. There is a
third possibility, viz. that it is used in an intellectual sense,
'having the idea of the world present to their mind;' and this would be
in accordance with the more usual use of sa*ññ*î. But how easily,
especially in Buddhism, the intellectual merges into the religious may
be seen from such a phrase as mara*n*a-sa*ññ*ino, used at Mahâva*m*sa
33. Of the bhikkhus. Compare also above, III, 14.\]

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

'But of what kind of spirits is the Lord, the venerable Anuruddha,
thinking?'

21\. 'There are spirits, brother Ânanda, in the sky, but of worldly
mind, who dishevel their hair and weep, and stretch forth their arms and
weep, fall prostrate on the ground, and roll to and fro in anguish at
the thought: "Too soon has the

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span> Blessed One died! Too soon has the
Happy One passed away! Too soon has the Light gone out in the world! "'

'There are spirits, too, Ânanda, on the earth, and of worldly mind, who
tear their hair and weep, and stretch forth their arms and weep, fall
prostrate on the ground, and roll to and fro in anguish at the thought:
"Too soon has the Blessed one died! Too soon has the Happy One passed
away! Too soon has the Light gone out in the world!"

'But the spirits who are free from passion bear it, calm and
self-possessed, mindful of the saying which begins, "Impermanent indeed
are all component things. How then is it possible \[that such a being
should not be dissolved\]?"'

------------------------

22\. Now the venerable Anuruddha and the venerable Ânanda spent the rest
of that night in religious discourse. Then the venerable Anuruddha said
to the venerable Ânanda: 'Go now, brother Ânanda, into Kusinârâ and
inform the Mallas of Kusinârâ, saying, 'The Blessed One, O Vâse*tth*as,
is dead: do, then, whatever seemeth to you fit!'

'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable Ânanda, in assent, to the venerable
Anuruddha. And having robed himself early in the morning, he took his
bowl, and went into Kusinârâ with one of the brethren as an attendant.

23\. Now at that time the Mallas of Kusinârâ were assembled in the
council hall concerning that very matter.

And the venerable Ânanda went to the council hall of the Mallas of
Kusinârâ; and when he had arrived there, he informed them, saying, 'The

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

Blessed One, O Vâse*tth*as, is dead; do, then, whatever seemeth to you
fit!'

24\. And when they had heard this saying of the venerable Ânanda, the
Mallas, with their young men and their maidens and their wives, were
grieved, and sad, and afflicted at heart. And some of them wept,
dishevelling their hair, and some stretched forth their arms and wept,
and some fell prostrate on the ground, and some reeled to and fro in
anguish at the thought: 'Too soon has the Blessed One died! Too soon has
the Happy One passed away! Too soon has the Light gone out in the
world!'

------------------------

25\. Then the Mallas of Kusinârâ gave orders to their attendants,
saying, 'Gather together perfumes and garlands, and all the music in
Kusinârâ!'

26\. And the Mallas of Kusinârâ took the perfumes and garlands, and all
the musical instruments, and five hundred suits of apparel, and went to
the Upavattana, to the Sâla Grove of the Mallas, where the body of the
Blessed One lay. There they past the day in paying honour, reverence,
respect, and homage to the remains of the Blessed One with dancing, and
hymns, and music, and with garlands and perfumes; and in making canopies
of their garments, and preparing decoration wreaths to hang
thereon\[1\].

\[1. The dress of the Mallas consisted probably of mere lengths of
muslin or cotton cloth; and a suit of apparel consisted of two or, at
the outside, of three of these-one to wrap round the loins, one to throw
over the shoulders, and one to use as a turban. To make a canopy on
occasions of state they would join such pieces together; to make the
canopy into a tent they would simply add walls of the same material; and
the only decoration, as simple as it {footnote p. 123} is beautiful,
would be wreaths of flowers, or single lotuses, hanging from the roof,
or stretched along the sides.\]

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

27\. Then the Mallas of Kusinârâ thought:

'It is much too late to burn the body of the Blessed One to-day. Let us
now perform the cremation to-morrow.' And in paying honour, reverence,
respect, and homage to the remains of the Blessed One with dancing, and
hymns, and music, and with garlands and perfumes; and in making canopies
of their garments, and preparing decoration wreaths to hang thereon,
they past the second day too, and then the third day, and the fourth,
and the fifth, and the sixth day also.

------------------------

28\. Then on the seventh day the Mallas of Kusinârâ thought:

'Let us carry the body of the Blessed One, by the south and outside, to
a spot on the south, and outside of the city,--paying it honour, and
reverence, and respect, and homage, with dance and song and music, with
garlands and perfumes,--and there, to the south of the city, let us
perform the cremation ceremony!'

29\. And thereupon eight chieftains among the Mallas bathed their heads,
and clad themselves in new garments with the intention of bearing the
body of the Blessed One. But, behold, they could not lift it up!

30\. Then the Mallas of Kusinârâ said to the venerable Anuruddha: 'What,
Lord, can be the reason, what can be the cause that eight chieftains of
the Mallas who have bathed their heads, and clad themselves in new
garments with the intention

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

of bearing the body of the Blessed One, are unable to lift it up?'

'It is because you, O Vâse*tth*as, have one purpose, and the spirits
have another purpose.'

3 1. 'But what, Lord, is the purpose of the spirits?'

'Your purpose, O Vâsetthas, is this, Let us carry the body of the
Blessed One, by the south and outside, to a spot on the south, and
outside of the city,--paying it honour, and reverence, and respect, and
homage, with dance and song and music, with garlands and perfumes,--and
there, to the south of the city, let us perform the cremation ceremony.
But the purpose of the spirits, Vâse*tth*as, is this, Let us carry the
body of the Blessed One by the north to the north of the city, and
entering the city by the north gate, let us bring it through the midst
of the city into the midst thereof. And going out again by the eastern
gate,--paying honour, and reverence, and respect, and homage to the body
of the Blessed One, with heavenly dance, and song, and music, and
garlands, and perfumes,--let us carry it to the shrine of the Mallas
called Maku*t*a-bandhana, to the east of the city, and there let us
perform the cremation ceremony.'

'Even according to the purpose of the spirits, so, Lord, let it be!'

32\. Then immediately all Kusinârâ down even to the dust bins and
rubbish heaps became strewn knee-deep with Mandârava flowers from
heaven! and while both the spirits from the skies, and the Mallas of
Kusinârâ upon earth, paid honour, and reverence, and respect, and homage
to the body of the Blessed One, with dance and song and music, with
garlands and with perfumes, they carried the

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

body by the north to the north of the city; and entering the city by the
north gate they carried it through the midst of the city into the midst
thereof; and going out again by the eastern gate they carried it to the
shrine of the Mallas, called Maku*t*a-bandhana; and there, to the cast
of the city, they laid down the body of the Blessed One\[1\].

33.<sup>\[2\]</sup> Then the Mallas of Kusinârâ said to the venerable
Ânanda: 'What should be done, Lord, with the remains of the Tathâgata?'

'As men treat the remains of a king of kings, so, Vâse*tth*as, should
they treat the remains of a Tathâgata.'

'And how, Lord, do they treat the remains of a king of kings?'

'They wrap the body of a king of kings, Vâse*tth*as, in a new cloth.
When that is done they wrap it in cotton wool. When that is done they
wrap it in a new cloth,--and so on till they have wrapped the body in
five hundred successive layers of both kinds. Then they place the body
in an oil vessel of iron, and cover that close up with another oil
vessel of iron. They then build a funeral pile of all kinds of perfumes,
and burn the body of the king of kings. And then at the four cross roads
they erect a dâgaba to the king of kings. This, Vâse*tth*as, is the way
in which they treat the remains of a king of kings.

'And as they treat the remains of a king of kings, so, Vâse*tth*as,
should they treat the remains of the

\[1. The point of this interesting legend is that the inhabitants of an
Indian village of that time would have considered it a desecration or
pollution to bring a dead body into or through their village.

2\. Compare Chap. V, §§ 25-30.\]

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

Tathâgata. At the four cross roads a dâgaba should be erected to the
Tathâgata. And whosoever shall there place garlands or perfumes or
paint, or make salutation there, or become in its presence calm in
heart-that shall long be to them for a profit and a joy.'

34\. Therefore the Mallas gave orders to their attendants, saying,
'Gather together all the carded cotton wool of the Mallas!'

35\. Then the Mallas of Kusinârâ wrapped the body of the Blessed One in
a new cloth. And when that was done, they wrapped it in cotton wool. And
when that was done, they wrapped it in a new cloth,--and so on till they
had wrapped the body of the Blessed One in five hundred layers of both
kinds. And then they placed the body in an oil vessel of iron, and
covered that close up with another oil vessel of iron. And then they
built a funeral pile of all kinds of perfumes, and upon it they placed
the body of the Blessed One.

36\. Now at that time the venerable Mahâ Kassapa was journeying along
the high road from Pâvâ to Kusinârâ with a great company of the
brethren, with about five hundred of the brethren. And the venerable
Mahâ Kassapa left the high road, and sat himself down at the foot of a
certain tree.

37\. Just at that time a certain naked ascetic who had picked up a
Mandârava flower in Kusinârâ was coming along the high road to Pâvâ.

38\. And the venerable Mahâ Kassapa saw the naked ascetic coming in the
distance; and when he had seen him he said to the naked ascetic:

'O friend! surely thou knowest our Master?'

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

'Yea, friend! I know him. This day the Sama*n*a Gotama has been dead a
week That is how I obtained this Mandârava flower.'

39\. And immediately of those of the brethren who were not yet free from
the passions, some stretched out their arms and wept, and some fell
headlong on the ground, and some reeled to and fro in anguish at the
thought: 'Too soon has the Blessed One died! Too soon has the Happy One
passed away from existence! Too soon has the Light gone out in the
world!'

But those of the brethren who were free from the passions (the Arahats)
bore their grief collected and composed at the thought: 'Impermanent are
all component things! How is it possible that they should not be
dissolved?'

------------------------

40\. Now at that time a brother named Subhadda, who had been received
into the order in his old age, was seated there in their company\[1\].

And Subhadda the old addressed the brethren, and said: 'Enough,
brethren! Weep not, neither lament! We are well rid of the great
Sama*n*a. We used to be annoyed by being told, "This beseems you, this
beseems you not." But now we shall be able to do whatever we like; and
what we do not like, that we shall not have to do!'

\[1. At p. xxvi of the Introduction to his edition of the Mahâ Vagga,
Dr. Oldenberg identifies this Subhadda with Subhadda the last convert,
mentioned above in Chap. V, §§ 52-68. They are different persons; the
last convert being represented as a young man of high character,
incapable of the conduct here ascribed to this Subhadda. The last
convert was a Brâhman, traditionally supposed to be younger brother to
A*ññ*a Konda*ññ*a, the first convert; this Subhadda had been a barber in
the village Âtumâ.\]

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

41\. But the venerable Mahâ Kassapa addressed the brethren, and said:
'Enough, my brethren! Weep not, neither lament! Has not the Blessed One
formerly declared this to us, that it is in the very nature of all
things, near and dear unto us, that we must divide ourselves from them,
leave them, sever ourselves from them? How then, brethren, can this be
possible--that whereas anything whatever born, brought into being, and
organised contains within itself the inherent necessity of
dissolution--how then can this be possible that such a being should not
be dissolved? No such condition can exist!'

------------------------

42\. Now just at that time four chieftains of the Mallas had bathed
their heads and clad themselves in new garments with the intention of
setting on fire the funeral pile of the Blessed One. But, behold, they
were unable to set it alight!

43\. Then the Mallas of Kusinârâ said to the venerable Anuruddha: 'What,
Lord, can be the reason, and what the cause, that four chieftains of the
Mallas who have bathed their heads, and clad themselves in new garments,
with the intention of setting on fire the funeral pile of the Blessed
One, are unable to set it on fire?'

'It is because you, O Vâse*tth*as, have one purpose, and the spirits
have another purpose.'

44\. 'But what, Lord, is the purpose of the spirits?'

'The purpose of the spirits, O Vâse*tth*as, is this: That venerable
brother Mahâ Kassapa is now journeying along the high road from Pâvâ to
Kusinârâ with a great company of the brethren, with five hundred of the
brethren. The funeral pile of

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

the Blessed One shall not catch fire, until the venerable Mahâ Kassapa
shall have been able reverently to salute the sacred feet of the Blessed
One.'

'Even according to the purpose of the spirits, so, Lord, let it be!'

------------------------

45\. Then the venerable Mahâ Kassapa went on to Maku*t*a-bandhana of
Kusinârâ, to the shrine of the Mallas, to the place where the funeral
pile of the Blessed One was. And when he had come up to it, he arranged
his robe on one shoulder; and bowing down with clasped hands he thrice
walked reverently round the pile; and then, uncovering the feet, he
bowed down in reverence at the feet of the Blessed One.

46\. And those five hundred brethren arranged their robes on one
shoulder; and bowing down with clasped hands, they thrice walked
reverently round the pile, and then bowed down in reverence at the feet
of the Blessed One.

47\. And when the homage of the venerable Mahâ Kassapa and of those five
hundred brethren was ended, the funeral pile of the Blessed One caught
fire of itself\[1\].

\[1. It is possible that we have here the survival of some ancient
custom. Spence Hardy appropriately refers to a ceremony among Jews (of
what place or time is not mentioned) in the following terms: 'Just
before a Jew is taken out of the house to be buried, the relatives and
acquaintances of the departed stand round the coffin; when the feet are
uncovered; and each in rotation lays hold of the great toes, and begs
pardon for any offence given to the deceased, and requests a favourable
mention of them in the next world.' (Manual of Buddhism, p. 348).

The Buddhist bhikkhus in Siam and the great majority of those in Ceylon
(the adherents of the Siyam-samâgama) always keep one shoulder
uncovered. It is evident that the bhikkhus {footnote p. 130} in Burma,
and those in Ceylon who belong to the Amara-pura-samâgama, are more in
accordance with ancient custom in wearing the robe ordinarily over both
shoulders.\]

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

48\. Now as the body of the Blessed One burned itself away, from the
skin and the integument, and the flesh, and the nerves, and the fluid of
the joints, neither soot nor ash was seen: and only the bones remained
behind.

Just as one sees no soot or ash when glue or oil is burned; so, as the
body of the Blessed One burned itself away, from the skin and the
integument, and the flesh, and the nerves, and the fluid of the joints,
neither soot nor ash was seen: and only the bones remained behind. And
of those five hundred pieces of raiment the very innermost and outermost
were both consumed.

49\. And when the body of the Blessed One had been burnt up, there came
down streams of water from the sky and extinguished the funeral pile of
the Blessed One; and there burst forth streams of water from the
storehouse of the waters (beneath the earth), and extinguished the
funeral pile of the Blessed One. The Mallas of Kusinârâ also brought
water scented with all kinds of perfumes, and extinguished the funeral
pile of the Blessed One\[1\].

\[1. There is something very quaint in the way in which the faithful
Mallas are here represented as bringing coals to Newcastle. The
'storehouse of the waters' is in Pâli udaka-sâla, on which Buddhaghosa
has two theories: first, that the Sâla trees around shed down a
miraculous rain from their trunks and branches and leaves; and next,
that the waters burst up from the earth and became as it were a diadem
of crystal round the pyre. On the belief that water thus burst up
miraculously through the earth, see 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' pp. 64,
67. If the reading be correct it is scarcely possible that sâla can here
have anything to do with Sâla trees; but the other interpretation is
open to the objections {footnote p. 131} that sâla means an open hall
rather than a storehouse, and that the belief in a 'storehouse of water'
has not, as yet, been found elsewhere.\]

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

50\. Then the Mallas of Kusinârâ surrounded the bones of the Blessed One
in their council hall with a lattice work of spears, and with a rampart
of bows; and there for seven days they paid honour and reverence and
respect and homage to them with dance and song and music, and with
garlands and perfumes.

------------------------

51\. Now the king of Magadha, A*g*âtasattu, the son of the queen of the
Videha clan, heard the news that the Blessed One had died at Kusinârâ.

Then the king of Magadha, A*g*âtasattu, the son of the queen of the
Videha clan, sent a messenger to the Mallas, saying, 'The Blessed One
belonged to the soldier caste, and I too am of the soldier caste. I am
worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One. Over the
remains of the Blessed One will I put up a sacred cairn, and in their
honour will I celebrate a feast\[1\]!'

52\. And the Li*kkh*avis of Vesâli heard the news that the Blessed One
had died at Kusinârâ. And the Li*kkh*avis of Vesâli sent a messenger to
the Mallas, saying, 'The Blessed One belonged to the soldier caste, and
we too are of the soldier caste. We are worthy to receive a portion of
the relics of the Blessed One. Over the remains of the Blessed One will
we put up a sacred cairn, and in their honour will we celebrate a
feast!'

53\. And the Sâkiyas of Kapila-vatthu heard the

\[1. The commentator gives a long account of A*g*âtasattu's proceedings
on this occasion.\]

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

news that the Blessed One had died at Kusinârâ. And the Sâkiyas of
Kapila-vatthu sent a messenger to the Mallas, saying, 'The Blessed One
was the pride of our race. We are worthy to receive a portion of the
relics of the Blessed One. Over the remains of the Blessed One will we
put up a sacred cairn, and in their honour will we celebrate a feast!'

54\. And the Bulis of Allakappa heard the news that the Blessed One had
died at Kusinârâ. And the Bulis of Allakappa sent a messenger to the
Mallas, saying, 'The Blessed One belonged to the soldier caste, and we
too are of the soldier caste. We are worthy to receive a portion of the
relics of the Blessed One. Over the remains of the Blessed One will we
put up a sacred cairn, and in their honour will we celebrate a feast!'

55\. And the Koliyas of Râmagâma heard the news that the Blessed One had
died at Kusinârâ. And the Koliyas of Râmagâma sent a messenger to the
Mallas, saying, 'The Blessed One belonged to the soldier caste, and we
too are of the soldier caste. We are worthy to receive a portion of the
relics of the Blessed One. Over the remains of the Blessed One will we
put up a sacred cairn, and in their honour will we celebrate a feast!'

56\. And the Brâhman of Ve*th*adîpa heard the news that the Blessed One
had died at Kusinârâ. And the Brâhman of Ve*th*adîpa sent a messenger to
the Mallas, saying, 'The Blessed One belonged to the soldier caste, and
I am a Brâhman. I am worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the
Blessed One. Over the remains of the Blessed One will I put up a sacred
cairn, and in their honour will I celebrate a feast!'

57\. And the Mallas of Pâvâ heard the news that the Blessed One had died
at Kusinârâ.

Then the Mallas of Pâvâ sent a messenger to the Mallas, saying, 'The
Blessed One belonged to the soldier caste, and we too are of the soldier
caste. We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed
One. Over the remains of the Blessed One will we put up a sacred cairn,
and in their honour will we celebrate a feast!'

------------------------

58\. When they heard these things the Mallas of Kusinârâ spoke to the
assembled brethren, saying, 'The Blessed One died in our village domain.
We will not give away any part of the remains of the Blessed One!'

59\. When they had thus spoken, Do*n*a the Brâhman addressed the
assembled brethren, and said:

'Hear, reverend sirs, one single word from me.  
Forbearance was our Buddha wont to teach.  
Unseemly is it that over the division  
Of the remains of him who was the best of beings  
Strife should arise, and wounds, and war!  
Let us all, sirs, with one accord unite  
In friendly harmony to make eight portions.  
Wide spread let Thûpas rise in every land  
That in the Enlightened One mankind may trust!

60\. 'Do thou then, O Brâhman, thyself divide the remains of the Blessed
One equally into eight parts, with fair division\[1\].'

Be it so, sir!' said Do*n*a, in assent, to the assembled

\[1. Here again the commentator expands and adds to the comparatively
simple version of the text.\]

brethren. And he divided the remains of the Blessed One equally into
eight parts, with fair division. And he said to them: 'Give me, sirs,
this vessel, and I will set up over it a sacred cairn, and in its honour
will I establish a feast.'

And they gave the vessel to Do*n*a the Brâhman.

------------------------

61\. And the Moriyas of Pipphalivana heard the news that the Blessed One
had died at Kusinârâ.

Then the Moriyas of Pipphalivana sent a messenger to the Mallas, saying,
'The Blessed One belonged to the soldier caste, and we too are of the
soldier caste. We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the
Blessed One. Over the remains of the Blessed One will we put up a sacred
cairn, and in their honour will we celebrate a feast!'

And when they heard the answer, saying, 'There is no portion of the
remains of the Blessed One left over. The remains of the Blessed One are
all distributed,' then they took away the embers.

------------------------

62\. Then the king of Magadha, A*g*âtasattu, the son of the queen of the
Videha clan, made a mound in Râ*g*agaha over the remains of the Blessed
One, and held a feast.

And the Li*kkh*avis of Vesâli made a mound in Vesâli over the remains of
the Blessed One, and held a feast.

And the Bulis of Allakappa made a mound in Allakappa over the remains of
the Blessed One, and held a feast.

And the Koliyas of Râmagâma made a mound in Râmagâma over the remains of
the Blessed One, and held a feast.

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

And Ve*th*adîpaka the Brâhman made a mound in Ve*th*adîpa over the
remains of the Blessed One, and held a feast.

And the Mallas of Pâvâ made a mound in Pâvâ over the remains of the
Blessed One, and held a feast.

And the Mallas of Kusinârâ made a mound in Kusinârâ over the remains of
the Blessed One, and held a feast.

And Do*n*a the Brâhman made a mound over the vessel in which the body
had been burnt, and held a feast.

And the Moriyas of Pipphalivana made a mound over the embers, and held a
feast.

Thus were there eight mounds \[Thûpas\] for the remains, and one for the
vessel, and one for the embers. This was how it used to be\[1\].

========================

\[63. Eight measures of relics there were of him of the far-seeing
eye,  
Of the best of the best of men. In India seven are worshipped,  
And one measure in Râmagâma, by the kings of the serpent race.  
One tooth, too, is honoured in heaven, and one in Gandhâra's city,  
One in the Kâlinga realm, and one more by the Nâga race.

\[1. Here closes Buddhaghosa's long and edifying commentary. He has no
note on the following verses, which he says were added by Theras in
Ceylon. The additional verse found in the Phayre MS. was in the same way
probably added in Burma.\]

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

Through their glory the bountiful earth is made bright with offerings
painless--  
For with such are the Great Teacher's relics best honoured by those who
are honoured,  
By gods and by Nâgas and kings, yea, thus by the noblest of Monarchs--  
Bow down with clasped hands!  
Hard, hard is a Buddha to meet with through hundreds of ages!\]
