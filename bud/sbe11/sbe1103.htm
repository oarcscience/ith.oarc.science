<P>IN translating this Sutta I have followed the text published by my friend the late Mr. Childers, first in the journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, and afterwards separately. In the former the text appeared in two instalments, the first two sheets, with many various readings in the footnotes, in the volume for 1874; and the remainder, with much fewer various readings, in the volume for 1876. The reprinted text omits most of the various readings in the first two sheets, and differs therefore slightly in the paging. The letters D, S, Y, and Z, mentioned in the notes, refer to MSS. sent to Mr. Childers from Ceylon by myself, Subh&ucirc;ti Unn&acirc;nse, Y&acirc;tramulle Unn&acirc;nse, and Mudliar de Zoysa respectively. The MS. mentioned as P (in the first two sheets quoted only in the separate edition) is, no doubt, the D&icirc;gha Nik&acirc;ya MS. of the Phayre collection in the India Office Library. The other four are now I believe in the British Museum.</P>
<P>The Hon. George Turnour of the Ceylon Civil Service published an analysis of this work in the journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society for 1839; but as he unfortunately skips, or only summarises, most of the difficult passages, his work, though a most valuable contribution for the time, now more than half a century ago, has not been of much service for the present purpose. Of much greater value was Buddhaghosa's commentary contained in the Suma<U>n</U>gala Vil&acirc;sin&icirc;[1]; but the great fifth-century commentator</P>

</FONT><P><A NAME="page_xxxii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxii</FONT></A></P>
<P>wrote of course for Buddhists, and not for foreign scholars; and his edifying notes and long exegetical expansions of the text (quite in the style of Matthew Henry) often fail to throw light on the very points which are most interesting, and most doubtful, to European readers.</P>
<P>The M&acirc;l&acirc;la<U>n</U>k&acirc;ra-vatthu, a late P&acirc;li work by a Burmese author of the eighteenth century[1], is based, in that part of it relating to the last days of the Buddha, almost exclusively on the Book of the Great Decease, and on Buddhaghosa's commentary upon it. Bishop Bigandet's translation into English of a Burmese translation of this work, well known under the title of 'The Life or Legend of Gaudama the Budha of the Burmese,' affords evidence therefore of the traditional explanations of the text. In the course either of the original author's recasting, or of the double translation, so many changes have taken place, that its evidence is frequently ambiguous and not always quite trustworthy: but with due caution, it may be used as a second commentary.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>The exact meaning which was originally intended by the title of the book is open to doubt. 'Great-Decease-Book' may as well mean 'the Great Book of the Decease,' as 'the Book of the Great Decease.' This book is in fact longer than any other in the collection, and the epithet 'Great' is often opposed in titles to a 'Short' Sutta of (otherwise) the same name[2]. But the epithet is also frequently intended, without doubt, to qualify the immediately succeeding word in the title[3]; and, though the phrase 'Great Decease,' as applied to the death of the Buddha, has not been found elsewhere, it is, I think, meant to do so here '.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. See 'The Life or Legend,' &amp;c., third edition, vol. ii. p. 149. The date there given (1134 of the Burmese era = 1773 A.D.) is evidently the date of the original work, and not of the translation. Nothing is said in the book itself or in Bishop Bigandet's notes of the name of the author, or of the name or date of the Burmese translator.</P>
<P>2. There are several such pairs in the Ma<I>ggh</I>im&acirc; Nik&acirc;ya; and the Mah&acirc;-Satippai<I>tth</I>&acirc;na-Sutta in the D&icirc;gha is the same as the Satipa<I>tth</I>&acirc;na-Sutta in the Ma<I>ggh</I>ima.</P>
<P>3. E.g. in the Mah&acirc;-padh&acirc;na-Sutta and Mah&acirc;-sudassana-Sutta.</P>
<P>4. Childers seems to have been of the same opinion, vide Dict. I, 268.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_xxxiii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxiii</FONT></A></P>
<P>The division of the Book into chapters, or rather Portions for Recitation, is found in the MSS.; the division of these chapters into sections has been made by myself. It will be noticed that a very large number of the sections have already been traced, chiefly by Dr. Morris and myself, in various other parts of the P&acirc;li Pi<I>t</I>akas: whole paragraphs or episodes, quite independent of the repetitions and stock phrases above referred to, recurring in two or more places. The question then arises whether (1) the Book of the Great Decease is the borrower, whether (2) it is the original source, or whether (3) these passages were taken over, both into it, and into the other places where they recur, from earlier sources. It will readily be understood that, in the present state of our knowledge, or rather ignorance, of the P&acirc;li Pi<I>t</I>akas, this question cannot as yet be answered with any certainty. But a few observations may even now be made.</P>
<P>Generally speaking the third of the above possible explanations is not only more probable in itself, but is confirmed by parallel instances in literatures developed under similar conditions, both in the valley of the Ganges and in the basin of the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>It is quite possible that while some books--such as the Mah&acirc;-vagga, the <I>K</I>ulla-vagga, and the D&icirc;gha Nik&acirc;ya-usually owe their resemblances to older sources now lost or absorbed; others--such as the Sa<I>m</I>yutta and the A<U>n</U>guttara--are always in such cases simply borrowers from sources still existing.</P>
<P>At the time when our Book of the Great Decease was put into its present shape, and still more so when a Book of the Great Decease was first drawn up, there may well have been some reliable tradition as to the events that took place, and as to the subjects of his various discourses, on the Buddha's last journey. He had then been a public Teacher for forty-five years; and his system of doctrine, which is really, on the whole, a very simple one, had already been long ago elaborated, and applied in numerous discourses to almost every conceivable variety of circumstances. What he then said would most naturally be, as it is represented to have been, a final recapitulation of the most</P>
<P><A NAME="page_xxxiv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxiv</FONT></A></P>
<P>important and characteristic tenets of his religion. But these are, of course, precisely those subjects which are most fully and most frequently dealt with in other parts of the P&acirc;li Pi<I>t</I>akas. No record of his actual words could have been preserved. It is quite evident that the speeches placed in the Teacher's mouth, though formulated in the first person, in direct narrative, are only intended to be summaries, and very short summaries, of what was said on these occasions. Now if corresponding summaries of his previous teaching had been handed down in the Order, and were in constant use among them, at the time when the Book of the Great Decease was put together, it would be a safe and easy method to insert such previously existing summaries in the historical account as having been spoken at the places where the Teacher was traditionally believed to have spoken on the corresponding doctrines. In the historical book the simple summaries would sufficiently answer every purpose; but when each particular matter became the subject of a separate book or division of a book, the same summaries would be included, but would be amplified and elucidated. And this is in fact the relation in which several of the recurring passages, as found in the Book of the Great Decease, stand to the same passages when found elsewhere.</P>
<P>On the other hand, some of the recurring passages do not consist of such summaries, but are actual episodes in the history. As an instance of these we may take the long extract at the end of the first, and the beginning of the second chapter (I, 20-II, 3, and again II, 16-II, 24), which is found also in the Mah&acirc;-vagga. The words are (nearly[1]) identical in both places, but in the Book of the Great Decease the account occurs in its proper place in the middle of a connected narrative, whereas in the Mah&acirc;-vagga, a treatise on the Rules and Regulations of the Order, it seems strangely out of place. So the passage, also a long one, with which the Book of the Great</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. On the difference see the note at II, 16. It affects only a few localising phrases in a narrative occupying (in the translation) thirteen pages.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_xxxv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxv</FONT></A> Decease commences (on the Seven Conditions of Welfare), seems to have been actually borrowed by the A<U>n</U>guttara Nik&acirc;ya from our work.</P>
<P>The question of these summaries and parallel passages cannot be adequately treated by a discussion of the instances found in any one particular book. It must be considered as a whole, and quite apart from the allied question of the 'stock phrases' above alluded to, in a discussion of all the instances that can be found in the P&acirc;li Pi<I>t</I>akas. For this purpose tabulated statements are essential, and as a mere beginning such a statement is here annexed (including the passages, marked with an asterisk, which have every appearance of belonging to the same category).</P>

<P>No Sanskrit work has yet been discovered giving an account of the last days of Gotama; but there arc several Chinese works. which seem to be related to ours. Of one especially, named the Fo Pan-ni-pan King (apparently Buddha-Parinibb&acirc;na-Sutta, but such an expression is unknown in P&acirc;li), Mr. Beal says[2]:</P>
<P>'This appears to be the same as the S&ucirc;tra known in the South.... It was translated into Chinese by a Shaman called Fa-tsu, of the Western Tsin dynasty, circa 200 A.D.'</P>
<P>I do not understand this date. The Western Tsin dynasty is placed by Mr. Beal himself on the fly-leaf of the Catalogue at 265-313 A.D. And whether the book referred to is really the same work as the Book of the Great Decease seems to me to be very doubtful. At p. 160 of his 'Catena of Buddhist Scriptures from the Chinese' Mr. Beal says, that another Chinese work 'known as the Mah&acirc; Parinirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a S&ucirc;tra' 'is evidently the same as the Mah&acirc; Parinibb&acirc;na Sutta of Ceylon,' but it is quite evident from the extracts which he gives that it is an entirely different and much later work.</P>
<P>On this book there would seem further to be a translated commentary, Ta Pan-ni-pan King Lo, mentioned</P>

<P>Whether Nos. 1 and 2, and again 3 and 6 are the same is not stated; and in the Indian Antiquary for 1875 Mr. Beal gives an account of another undated work, as existing in the India Office Collection, bearing a different title from any of the above, but which he also translates as Mah&acirc;parinibb&acirc;na Sutta. It purports to be the very oldest of the Vaipulya S&ucirc;tras, whereas the book quoted in the Catena is there said to be 'one of the latest of the expanded S&ucirc;tras.'</P>
<P>'The general outline,' says Mr. Beal[1], 'is this. Buddha, on a certain occasion, proceeded to Kinsinagara (sic), and entering a grove of S&acirc;la trees, there reposed. He received a gift of food from Chanda, an artisan of the neighbouring town. After partaking of the food he was seized with illness. He discoursed through the night with his disciples, and disputed with certain heretical teachers. At early dawn he turned on his right side with his head to the north, and died. The S&acirc;la trees bent down to form a canopy over his head. The account then proceeds to relate</P>

<P>the circumstances of his cremation, and the subsequent disputes, between the Mallas and others, for his ashes.'</P>
<P>There is a curious echo here of some of the sections translated below; though each particular item of the summary is really in contradiction with the corresponding part of the P&acirc;li book. There is perhaps another Chinese work on the death of Buddha, of the existence of which I have been informed, through the kind intervention of Professor Max M&uuml;ller, by Mr. Kasawara. It was translated by Po-fa-tsu between 290 and 306 A. D. It seems to be the same as the first mentioned above, but it contains a good deal of matter not found in the Mah&acirc;-parinibb&acirc;na-Sutta (notably an account of the R&acirc;gagaha Council, the mention of which is so conspicuously absent from the P&acirc;li work); and it omits many of the sections found in the P&acirc;li. Mr. Kasawara has been kind enough to send me the following details regarding those omissions, and they are of peculiar interest as compared with the table given above[1]:</P>

<P>There is no evidence to show that any of the above works are translations of our Sutta, or in any sense the same work. No reliance, in fact, can be placed upon the mere similarity of title in order to show that a Chinese work and an Indian one are really the same: and I regret that attempts should have been made to fix the date of Indian works by the fact that Chinese translations bearing similar titles are said to have been made in a certain period. But the above-mentioned works on the Great Decease will, when published, throw valuable light on the traditions of different, though no doubt later, schools of Buddhist thought; and a detailed comparison would probably throw a very interesting light on the way in which</P>

</FONT><P><A NAME="page_xxxix"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxix</FONT></A></P>
<P>religious legends of this kind vary and grow; and the existence of these Chinese translations affords ground for the hope that we may some day discover an earlier Sanskrit work on the same subject[1].</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>The cremation ceremonies described in the sixth chapter are not without interest. It would be natural enough that Gotama should have been buried without any of those ritualistic forms the usefulness of which he denied, and without any appeal to gods whose power over men he ignored. But the tone of the narrative makes it at least possible that there was not really anything unusual in the method of his cremation; and that the elaborate rites prescribed in the Br&acirc;hmanical books for use at a funeral[2] were not, in practice, observed in the case of the death of any person other than a wealthy Br&acirc;hman, or some layman of rank who was a devoted adherent of the Br&acirc;hmans.</P>
<P>In the same way we find that in those countries where the more ancient form of Buddhism still prevails, there are a few simple forms to be used in the case of the cremation of a distinguished Bhikkhu or Up&acirc;saka; but in ordinary cases bodies are buried without any ceremony.</P>
<P>So in Ceylon, Robert Knox--whose rare and curious work, one of the most trustworthy books of travels extant, deserves more notice than it has received, and who was a captive there for many years before the natives were influenced by any contact with Europeans--says[3],</P>
<P>'It may not be unacceptable to relate how they burn their dead. As for persons of inferior quality, they are interred in some convenient places in the woods (there being no set places for burial), carried thither by two or three of their friends, and buried without any more ado. They lay them on their backs, with their heads to the West, and their feet to the East, as we do. Then these people go and wash: for they are unclean by handling the dead.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. I have not been able to trace any reference to either of these Chinese works in Mr. Edkins's 'Chinese Buddhism.'</P>

</FONT><P><A NAME="page_xl"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xl</FONT></A></P>
<P>'But persons of greater quality are burned, and that with ceremony. When they are dead they lay them out, and put a cloth over their privy parts; and then wash the body, by taking half a dozen pitchers of water and pouring upon it. Then they cover him with a linen cloth, and so carry him forth to burning. This is when they burn the body speedily. But otherwise they cut down a tree that may be proper for their purpose, and hollow it like a hog-trough, and put the body, being disembowelled and embalmed, into it, filling up all about with pepper, and so let it lie in the house until it be the king's command to carry it out to the burning. For that they dare not do without the king's order if the person deceased be a courtier. Sometimes the king gives no order in a great while; it may be not at all: therefore, in such cases, that the body may not take up house-room or annoy them, they dig a hole in the floor of their house, and put hollowed tree and all in, and cover it. If afterwards the king commands to burn the body, they take it up again, in obedience to the king-otherwise there it lies.</P>
<P>'Their order for burning is this: if the body be not thus put into a trough or hollow tree, it is laid upon one of his bedsteads, which is a great honour among them. This bedstead with the body on it, or hollowed tree with the body in it, is fastened with poles, and carried upon men's shoulders unto the place of burning, which is some eminent place in the fields, or highways, or where else they please. There they lay it upon a pile of wood some two or three feet high;--then they pile up more wood upon the corpse, lying thus on the bedstead or in the trough. Over all they have a kind of canopy built (if he be a person of very high quality), covered at top, hung about with painted cloth, and bunches of cocoa-nuts, and green boughs; and so fire is put to it. After all is burnt to ashes, they sweep together the ashes into the manner of a sugar-loaf, and hedge the place round from wild beasts breaking in, and they will sow herbs there. Thus I saw the king's uncle, the chief tirinanx[1] (who was, as it were, the chief primate of all the</P>

</FONT><P><A NAME="page_xli"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xli</FONT></A></P>
<P>nation), burned upon a high place, that the blaze might be seen a great way[1].'</P>
<P>I myself saw an Unn&acirc;ns&ecirc; burned very much in this way near the Weyangoda Court-house; and there is a long account in the native newspaper, the Lak-riwi-kirana (Ceylon Sunbeam), of the 12th March, 1870, Of the cremation of a Weda-r&acirc;la, or native doctor. Bishop Bigandet relates in a note in his 'Life or Legend of Gautama' the corresponding ceremonies still in use in Burma, of which he has been a witness[2]; but cremation is apparently as seldom resorted to in Burma as it is in Ceylon.</P>
<P>The unceremonious mode of burying the dead referred to by Knox is not adopted in the more settled districts on the sea coast. When at Galle I enquired into the funeral customs there prevalent, with the following result[3]:</P>
<P>A few hours after a man has died, the relations wash the corpse, shave it; and, having clothed it with a strip of clean white cloth, place it on a bedstead covered with white cloth, and under a canopy (wiyana) also of white cloth. They then place two lamps, one to burn at the head, and the other at the foot of the corpse, and use perfumes.</P>
<P>A coffin is then prepared, covered with black cloth; and the body is placed on the coffin, and is then sprinkled over with lavender or rose-water. The women meanwhile bow backwards and forwards with their hands behind their heads, uttering loud wailings over the deceased.</P>
<P>Then the male relatives carry the coffin to the grave, which is dug in one of their own cocoa-nut topes near by, and over which is raised a more or less elaborate canopy or arch of cloths and evergreens (ge<I>d</I>i-ge), adorned with the tender leaves and flowers of the cocoa-nut. Along the path also from the house to the grave young cocoa-nut leaves and flowers are sometimes hung, and the pathway itself is often spread with clean white cloths.</P>
<P>The tom-tom beaters go first; and the dull monotonous</P>

<P>sound of their instruments of music is appropriate enough. Then follow some Buddhist mendicants, in number according to the wealth or influence of the deceased, and walking under a portable canopy of white cloth. Then the coffin is carried by the nearest male relatives, and followed by other male relatives and relations--no females, even the widowed mother of an only son, taking part in this last sad procession.</P>
<P>Three times the coffin is carried round the grave: then it is placed on two sticks placed across the mouth of the pit; and one end of a roll of white cloth is placed on the coffin, the other end being held by all the Unn&acirc;ns&ecirc;s (Bhikkhus) whilst the people repeat three times in P&acirc;li the well-known formula of the Refuges (the simple Nicene Creed of the Buddhists):</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'I take my refuge in the Buddha,<BR>
I take my refuge in the Dhamma,<BR>
I take my refuge in the Order[1].'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then the priests respond, thrice repeating in P&acirc;li the well-known verse discussed below[2]:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'How transient are all component things!<BR>
Their nature's to be born and die;<BR>
Coming, they go; and then is best,<BR>
When each has ceased, and all is rest!'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then the Unn&acirc;ns&ecirc;s let go the roll of white cloth, and whilst water is poured from a goblet into a cup placed on a plate until the cup is full to the brim[3], they again chaunt three times in P&acirc;li the following verses:--</P>

<P>The relations then place the coffin. in the grave, and each throws in a handful of earth. The Unn&acirc;ns&ecirc;s then go away, taking the roll or rolls of cloth, one end of which was placed upon the coffin. The grave is filled in. Two lights, one at the head of it, and one at the foot, are left burning. And then the friends and relations return to the house.</P>
<P>The funeral now being over, is followed by a feast; for though nothing may be cooked in a house or hut in which there is a corpse, yet plenty of food has been brought in from neighbouring tenements by the relations of the deceased.</P>
<P>There is, however, yet another very curious ceremony to be gone through. Three or seven days--whichever, according to the rules of astrology, is a lucky day--after the deceased person died, an Unn&acirc;ns&ecirc; is duly invited to the house in which the deceased died. He arrives in the evening; reads bana (that is, the Word, passages from the sacred books) throughout the night; and in the morning is presented with a roll of white cloth, and is asked to partake of food, chiefly of course curries, of those different kinds of which the deceased had been most particularly fond.</P>

<P>This ceremony is called Mataka D&acirc;naya, (Gift for the Dead), and the previous feast is called Mataka Bhatta (Feast in honour of the Dead): the two combined taking the place of an ancient rite observed in pagan, pre-Buddhistic, times, and then also called Mataka Bhatta, in which offerings were made to the Petas; that is, to the manes, or departed ghosts, of ancestors and near relations. Such offerings are of course forbidden to Buddhists[1], and it is a very instructive instance of a survival in belief, of the effect of the natural reluctance to make much change in the mode of paying the customary funeral respect to deceased friends, that the kind of food supposed to be most appreciated by the dead should still be used in the Buddhist funeral rites.</P>
<P>Another part of the ceremony, that part where one end of a roll of cloth is placed on the coffin while the other end is held by all the assembled Unn&acirc;ns&ecirc;s[2], is a fragment of ritualistic symbolism which deserves attention. The members of the Buddhist Order of Mendicants were enjoined to avoid all personal decoration of any kind; and to attire themselves in cloths of no value, such as might be gathered from a dust heap (Pa<I>m</I>su-k&ucirc;la), or even from a cemetery. This was a principle to be followed, not a literal rule to be observed; and therefore from the first presents of strips of plain white cotton cloth, first torn in pieces to deprive them of any commercial value, then pieced together again and dyed a dull orange colour to call to mind the colour of old worn out linen, were the material from which the mendicants' clothing was actually made. But the duty of contempt for dress (called Pa<I>m</I>su-k&ucirc;lika<U>n</U>ga, from the dust heap) was never lost sight of, and advantage was taken of the gifts given by the faithful at funerals to impress this duty upon the minds of the assembled Bhikkhus.</P>
<P>Nothing is known of any religious ceremony having been performed by the early Buddhists in India, whether the person deceased was a layman, or even a member of the</P>

</FONT><P><A NAME="page_xlv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xlv</FONT></A> Order. The Vinaya Pi<I>t</I>aka, which enters at so great length into all the details of the daily life of the recluses, has no rules regarding the mode of treating the body of a deceased Bhikkhu. It was probably burnt, and very much in the manner described in the last chapter of our Sutta--that is to say, it was reverently carried out to some convenient spot, and there simply cremated on a funeral pyre without any religious ritual, a small tope being more often than not erected over the ashes. Though funerals are, naturally, not unfrequently mentioned in the historical books, and in the Birth Stories, there is nowhere any reference to a recognised mode of performing any religious ceremony[1].</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>The date of the Great Decease is not quite certain. The dwellers in the valley of the Ganges, for many generations after Gotama's death, were a happy people, who had no need of dates; and it was only long afterwards, and in Ceylon, that the great event became used as the starting-point for chronological calculations, as the Buddhist era.</P>
<P>The earliest use of the Buddha's Parinibb&acirc;na as such an era is in an Inscription of King Nissanka Malla's, of the twelfth century A.D., published by me in the journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1875. Both in the historical records of Ceylon, and in those passages of the Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as which are the nearest approach to historical records in India, the chronology is usually based on the lists of kings, just as it is in the Old Testament. Only by adding together the lengths of the reigns of the intermediate kings is it possible to calculate the length of the time that is said to have elapsed between any two given events.</P>
<P>If these lists of kings had been accurately kept from</P>

<P>Gotama's time to the time when the existing chronicles were compiled, we should be able, if we could fix the date of any one of the kings, to calculate the date of the Buddha's death. This last we can do; for the date of Kandragupta, and the date of his grandson Asoka, can be independently fixed within a few years by the aid of the Greek historians. But unfortunately the earlier parts of the otherwise reliable Ceylon chronicles are, like the earlier parts of Livy's otherwise reliable history of Rome, full of inconsistencies, and impossibilities.</P>
<P>According to the R&acirc;<I>g</I>a-parampar&acirc;, or line of kings, in the Ceylon chronicles, the date of the Great Decease would be 543 B.C., which is arrived at by adding to the date 161 B.C. (from which the reliable portion of the history begins) two periods of 146 and 236 years. The first purports to give the time which elapsed between 161 B.C. and the great Buddhist church Council held under Asoka, and in the eighteenth year of his reign, at Patna; and the second to give the interval between that Council and the Buddha's death.</P>
<P>It would result from the first calculation that the date of Asoka's coronation would be 325 B.C. (146 + 161 + 18). But we know that this must contain a blunder or blunders, as the date of Asoka's coronation can be fixed, as above stated, with absolute certainty within a year or two either way of 267 B.C.</P>
<P>Would it then be sound criticism to accept the other, earlier, period of 236 years found in those chronicles--a period which we cannot test by Greek chronology--and by simply adding the Ceylon calculation of 236 years to the European date for the eighteenth year of Asoka (that in circa 249 B.C.) to conclude that the Buddha died in or about 485 B.C.?</P>
<P>I cannot think so. The further we go back the greater does the probability of error become, not less. The most superficial examination of the details of this earlier period shows too, that they are unreliable; and what reliance would it be wise to place upon the total, apart from the details, when we find it mentioned for the first time in</P>
<P><A NAME="page_xlvii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xlvii</FONT></A></P>
<P>a work, the D&icirc;pava<I>m</I>sa, written eight centuries after the date it is proposed to fix?</P>
<P>If further proof were needed, we have it in the fact that the D&icirc;pava<I>m</I>sa actually contains the details of another calculation--based not on the lists of kings (R&acirc;<I>g</I>a-parampar&acirc;), but on a list of Theras (Thera-parampar&acirc;) stretching back from Asoka's time to the time of the great Teacher--which contradicts this calculation of 236 years.</P>
<P>The Thera-parampar&acirc; gives the name of the member of the Buddhist Order of Mendicants, that is, the Thera, who ordained Mahinda (the son of Asoka), then the name of the Thera who ordained that Thera, and so on. There are only five of them from Up&acirc;li, who was ordained sixteen years after Buddha's death, down to Mahinda inclusive. This would account not for 236, but only for about 150 years.</P>
<P>For let the reader take the case of any clergyman in the present day. The Bishop who ordains him would have been ordained thirty or forty years before; and four such intervals would fill out, not 236 years, but about a century and a half; and a similar argument applies with reasonable certainty to the case in point.</P>
<P>An examination of the details of the List of Theras confirms this conclusion strongly on every essential point. An examination also of the List of Kings shows that the period of 236 years is wrong by being too long. The shorter period of 150 years between Asoka and the Great Decease agrees much better with what we know of the literary history of Buddhism during that interval. And it also agrees with the tradition of the northern Buddhists as preserved by Hiouen Thsang, and in Kashmir and Tibet[1]. In the 'Questions of Milinda' also--a work of unknown date, preserved only in its P&acirc;li form, but</P>

</FONT><P><A NAME="page_xlviii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xlviii</FONT></A></P>
<P>possibly derived from a northern Buddhist Sanskrit work--the date of the Buddha's death is fixed at five hundred years before the time of Milinda[1], who certainly reigned about a century after Christ. I am, therefore, of opinion that the hitherto accepted date of the Buddha's death should be modified accordingly.</P>
<P>This would make the date of the Great Decease about 420-400 B.C. (very possibly a year or two later), and the date of Gotama's birth therefore eighty years earlier, or in round numbers about 500 B.C.</P>
<P>I have discussed the whole question at full length in my 'Ancient Coins and Measures of Ceylon,' written in amplification of a paper read in 1874 before the Royal Asiatic Society; and to that work I must refer any reader, who may take interest in these chronological discussions, for ampler details. I have been able here to present only a summary of an argument which is in so far of little importance, inasmuch as the rectification which I have ventured to propose only differs by a little more than half a century from the earliest date which can in any case be suggested as approximately correct (that is about 485 B.C.). The date 543 B.C., still unfortunately accepted outside the circle of students of Buddhism[2], is now acknowledged to be too early by all scholars who have seriously considered the subject.</P>

The first word is not a personal name, but an official epithet, 'he against whom there has arisen no (worthy or equal) foe;' the second gives us the maiden family, or tribal (not personal) name of his mother. Persons of distinction are scarcely ever mentioned by name in Indian Buddhist books, a rule applying more especially to kings, but extended not unfrequently to private persons. Thus Upatissa, the earnest and thoughtful disciple whom the Buddha himself declared to be 'the second founder of the kingdom of righteousness,' is referred to either as Dhamma-sen&acirc;pati or as S&acirc;riputta; epithets of corresponding origin to those in the text. By the Gains Ag&acirc;tasattu is called K&ucirc;<I>n</I>ika or Ko<I>n</I>ika, which again is probably not the name given to him at the rice-eating (the ceremony corresponding to infant baptism), but a nickname acquired in after life.]</P>

Then tell him that A<I>g</I>&acirc;tasattu, son of the Vedehi, the king of Magadha, in his eagerness to attack the Va<I>gg</I>ians, has resolved, "I will root out these Va<I>gg</I>ians, mighty and powerful though they be, I will destroy these Va<I>gg</I>ians, I will bring these Va<I>gg</I>ians to utter ruin!" And bear carefully in mind whatever the Blessed One may predict, and repeat it to me. For the Buddhas speak nothing untrue!'</P>
<P>3. Then the Br&acirc;hman Vassak&acirc;ra, hearkened to the words of the king, saying, 'Be it as you say.' And ordering a number of magnificent carriages to be made ready, he mounted one of them, left R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha with his train, and went to the Vulture's Peak, riding as far as the ground was passable for carriages,</P>

<P>4. Now at that time the venerable &Acirc;nanda was standing behind the Blessed One, and fanning him. And the Blessed One said to him: 'Have you heard, &Acirc;nanda, that the Va<I>gg</I>ians hold full and frequent public assemblies?'</P>
<P>'Lord, so I have heard,' replied he.</P>
<P>'So long, &Acirc;nanda,' rejoined the Blessed One, 'as the Va<I>gg</I>ians hold these full and frequent public assemblies; so long may they be expected not to decline, but to prosper.'</P>
<P>[And in like manner questioning &Acirc;nanda, and receiving a similar reply, the Blessed One declared as follows the other conditions which would ensure the welfare of the Va<I>gg</I>ian confederacy<SUP>[2]</SUP>.]</P>
<P>'So long, &Acirc;nanda, as the Va<I>gg</I>ians meet together in concord, and rise in concord, and carry out their undertakings in concord--so long as they enact nothing not already established, abrogate nothing that has been already enacted, and act in accordance with the ancient institutions of the Va<I>gg</I>ians as established in former days--so long as they honour and esteem and revere and support the Va<I>gg</I>ian elders, and hold it a point of duty to hearken to their words--so long as no women or girls</P>

<P>5. Then the Blessed One addressed Vassak&acirc;ra the Br&acirc;hman, and said:</P>
<P>'When I was once staying, O Br&acirc;hman, at Ves&acirc;li at the S&acirc;randada Temple[1], I taught the Va<I>gg</I>ians these conditions of welfare; and so long as those conditions shall continue to exist among the Va<I>gg</I>ians, so long as the Va<I>gg</I>ians shall be well instructed in those conditions, so long may we expect them not to decline, but to prosper.'</P>
<P>'We may expect then,' answered the Br&acirc;hman, 'the welfare and not the decline of the Vaggians when they are possessed of any one of these conditions of welfare, how much more so when they are possessed of all the seven. So, Gotama, the Va<I>gg</I>ians cannot be overcome by the king of Magadha; that is, not in battle, without diplomacy or breaking up their alliance[3].

<P>6. Now soon after he had gone the Blessed One addressed the venerable &Acirc;nanda, and said: 'Go now, &Acirc;nanda, and assemble in the Service Hall such of the Brethren[1] as live in the neighbourhood of R&acirc;gagaha.'</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The word translated 'brethren' throughout is in the original bhikkh&ucirc;, a word most difficult to render adequately by any word which would not, to Christians and in Europe, connote something different from the Buddhist idea. A bhikkhu, literally 'beggar,' was a disciple who had joined Gotama's order; but the word refers to their renunciation of worldly things, rather than to their consequent mendicancy; and they did not really beg in our modern sense of the word. Hardy has 'priests;' I have elsewhere used ( monks' and sometimes 'beggars' and 'members of the order.' This last is, I think, the best rendering; but it is too long for constant repetition, as in this passage, and too complex to be a really good version of bhikkhu. The members of the order were not priests, for they had no priestly powers. They were not monks, for they took no vow of obedience, and could leave the order (and constantly did so and do so still) whenever they chose. They were not beggars, for they had none of the mental and moral qualities associated with that word. 'Brethren' connotes very much the position in which they stood to one another; but I wish there were a better word to use in rendering bhikkhu.]</P>

'Great is the fruit, great the advantage of earnest contemplation when set round with upright conduct. Great is the fruit, great the advantage of intellect when set round with earnest contemplation.

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This paragraph is spoken of as if it were a well-known summary, and it is constantly repeated below. The word I have rendered 'earnest contemplation' is sam&acirc;dhi, which occupies in the P&acirc;li Pi<I>t</I>akas very much the same position as faith does in the New Testament; and this section shows that the relative importance of sam&acirc;dhi, pa<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>&acirc;, and s&icirc;la played a part in early Buddhism just as the distinction between faith, reason, and works did afterwards in Western theology. It would be difficult to find a passage in which the Buddhist view of the relation of these conflicting ideas is stated with greater beauty of thought, or equal succinctness of form.</P>

The expression 'set round with' is in P&acirc;li paribh&acirc;vita, which Dr. Morris holds to be etymologically exactly parallel to our phrase 'perfected by,' on the ground that facio is a causal of the Latin representative of the Sanskrit root bh&ucirc;. In the <I>K</I>etokhila Sutta of the Ma<I>ggh</I>ima Nik&acirc;ya eggs are said to be paribh&acirc;vit&acirc;ni by a brooding hen.

Yet all living things of larger size that entered or left the city, would have to do so by that gate. Thus only is it, Lord, that I know the lineage of the faith. I know that the Arahat Buddhas of the past, putting away all lust, ill-will, sloth, pride, and doubt; knowing all those mental faults which make men weak; training their minds in the four kinds of mental activity; thoroughly exercising themselves in the sevenfold higher wisdom, received the full fruition of Enlightenment.

<P>house fit in every way for occupation[1], placed seats in it, set up a water-pot, and fixed an oil lamp. Then they returned to the Blessed One, and bowing, stood beside him, and said: 'All things are ready, Lord! It is time for you to do what you deem most fit.'</P>
<P>22. And the Blessed One robed himself, took his bowl and other things, went with the brethren to the rest house, washed his feet, entered the hall, and took his seat against the centre pillar, with his face towards the east. And the brethren also, after washing their feet, entered the hall, and took their seats round the Blessed One, against the western wall, and facing the cast. And the P&acirc;<I>t</I>alig&acirc;ma disciples too, after washing their feet, entered the hall, and took their seats opposite the Blessed One, against the eastern wall, and facing towards the west.</P>
<P>23. [2] Then the Blessed One addressed the P&acirc;<I>t</I>alig&acirc;ma disciples, and said: 'Fivefold, O householders, is the loss of the wrong-doer through his want of rectitude. In the first place the wrong-doer, devoid of rectitude, falls into great poverty through sloth; in the next place his evil repute gets noised abroad; thirdly, whatever society he enters--whether of Br&acirc;hmans, nobles, heads of houses, or Sama<I>n</I>as--</P>

The following sentences contain a synopsis of what was merely the elementary righteousness, the &Acirc;di-brahma-<I>k</I>ariya<I>m</I>, quite distinct from, and not for a moment to be compared in glory with the Magga-brahma-<I>k</I>ariya<I>m</I>, the system developed in the Noble Eightfold Path. It will have been seen above, § 11, that the latter, to be perfect, must be untarnished by the attraction of the hope of heaven or the fear of hell.]</P>

<P>he enters shyly and confused; fourthly, he is full of anxiety when he dies; and lastly, on the dissolution of the body, after death, he is reborn into some unhappy state of suffering or woe[1]. This, O householders, is the fivefold loss of the evil-doer!'</P>
<P>24. 'Fivefold, O householders, is the gain of the well-doer through his practice of rectitude. In the first place the well-doer, strong in rectitude, acquires great wealth through his industry; in the next place, good reports of him are spread abroad; thirdly, whatever society he enters--whether of nobles, Br&acirc;hmans, heads of houses, or members of the order--he enters confident and self-possessed; fourthly, he dies without anxiety; and lastly, on the dissolution of the body, after death, he is reborn into some happy state in heaven. This, O householders, is the fivefold gain of the well-doer.'</P>
<P>25. When the Blessed One had thus taught the disciples, and incited them, and roused them, and gladdened them, far into the night with religious discourse, he dismissed them, saying, 'The night is far spent, O householders. It is time for you to do what you deem most fit.' 'Even so, Lord!' answered the disciples of P&acirc;<I>t</I>alig&acirc;ma, and they rose from their seats, and bowing to the Blessed One, and keeping him on their right hand as they passed him, they departed thence.</P>
<P>And the Blessed One, not long after the disciples</P>

<P>of P&acirc;<I>t</I>alig&acirc;ma had departed thence, entered into his private chamber.</P>
<P>26. At that time Sun&icirc;dha and Vassak&acirc;ra, the chief ministers of Magadha, were building a fortress at P&acirc;<I>t</I>alig&acirc;ma to repel the Va<I>gg</I>ians, and there were a number of fairies who haunted in thousands the plots of ground there. Now, wherever ground is so occupied by powerful fairies, they bend the hearts of the most powerful kings and ministers to build dwelling-places there, and fairies of middling and inferior power bend in a similar way the hearts of middling or inferior kings and ministers.</P>
<P>27. And the Blessed One, with his great and clear vision, surpassing that of ordinary men, saw thousands of those fairies haunting P&acirc;<I>t</I>alig&acirc;ma. And he rose up very early in the morning, and said to &Acirc;nanda: 'Who is it then, &Acirc;nanda, who is building a fortress at P&acirc;<I>t</I>alig&acirc;ma?</P>
<P>'Sun&icirc;dha and Vassak&acirc;ra, Lord, the chief ministers of Magadha, are building a fortress there to keep back the Va<I>gg</I>ians.'</P>
<P>28. They act, &Acirc;nanda, as if they had consulted with the T&acirc;vati<I>m</I>sa, angels. [And telling him of what he had seen, and of the influence such fairies had, he added]: 'And among famous places of residence and haunts of busy men, this will become the chief, the city of P&acirc;<I>t</I>ali-putta, a centre for the interchange of all kinds of wares. But three dangers will hang over P&acirc;<I>t</I>ali-putta, that of fire, that of water, and that of dissension[1].'</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This paragraph is of importance to the orthodox Buddhist as proving the Buddha's power of prophecy and the authority of the {footnote p. 19} Buddhist scriptures. To those who conclude that such a passage must have been written after the event that is prophesied, it is valuable evidence of the age both of the Mah&acirc; Vagga and of the Mah&acirc;parinibb&acirc;na Sutta;--evidence, however, that cannot as yet be applied to its full extent, as the time at which P&acirc;<I>t</I>ali-g&acirc;ma had grown into the great and important city of P&acirc;<I>t</I>ali-putta is not as yet known with sufficient certainty. The late Burmese tradition on this point given in Bigandet's Legend of the Burmese Buddha, vol. ii, p. 183, can scarcely be depended upon, though it doubtless rests on older documents, and is mentioned also by Hiouen Thsang.</P>
<P>The curious popular belief as to good and bad fairies haunting the sites of houses gave rise to a quack science, akin to astrology, called vatthu-vi<I>gg</I>&acirc;, which Buddhaghosa explains here at some length, and which is frequently condemned elsewhere in the P&acirc;li Pi<I>t</I>akas. See, for instance, § 1 of the Mah&acirc;-s&icirc;la<I>m</I>, translated below in the Tevi<I>gg</I>a Sutta.

<P>29. Now Sun&icirc;dha and Vassak&acirc;ra, the chief ministers of Magadha, proceeded to the place where the Blessed One was. And when they had come there they exchanged with the Blessed One the greetings and compliments of friendship and civility, and stood there respectfully on one side. And, so standing, Sun&icirc;dha and Vassak&acirc;ra, the chief ministers of Magadha, spake thus to the Blessed One:</P>
<P>'May the venerable Gotama do us the honour of taking his meal, together with the company of the brethren, at our house to-day.' And the Blessed One signified, by silence, his consent.</P>
<P>30. Then when Sun&icirc;dha and Vassak&acirc;ra, the chief ministers of Magadha, perceived that he had given his consent, they returned to the place where they dwelt. And on arriving there, they prepared sweet dishes of boiled rice, and cakes; and informed the Blessed One, saying:</P>
<P><A NAME="page_20"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 20</FONT></A></P>
<P>'The hour of food has come, O Gotama, and all is ready.'</P>
<P>And the Blessed One robed himself early, took his bowl with him, and repaired with the brethren to the dwelling-place of Sun&icirc;dha and Vassak&acirc;ra, and sat down on the seat prepared for him. And with their own hands they set the sweet rice and the cakes before the brethren with the Buddha at their head, and waited on them till they had had enough. And when the Blessed One had finished eating his meal, the ministers brought a low seat, and sat down respectfully at his side.</P>
<P>31. And when they were thus seated the Blessed One gave thanks in these verses:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'Wheresoe'er the prudent man shall take up his abode<BR>
Let him support there good and upright men of self-control.<BR>
Let him give gifts to all such deities as may be there.<BR>
Revered, they will revere him: honoured, they honour him again;<BR>
Are gracious to him as a mother to her own, her only son.<BR>
And the man who has the grace of the gods, good fortune he beholds[1].'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This passage gives Buddhaghosa a good deal of difficulty, as it apparently inculcates offerings to the gods, which is contrary not only to both the letter and spirit of Buddhism, but also to the practice of Buddhists. He explains away the gifts to the deities by saying they are gifts of merit only (patti)--the giver giving the four necessaries to Bhikkhus, and then expressing a wish that the Devat&acirc;s should share in his pu<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>a. I am inclined to think, on the authority of the Deva-dhamma <I>G</I>&acirc;taka (No. 9 in 'Buddhist {footnote p. 21} Birth Stories'), that by the deities are here meant the good and upright men of self-control,' mentioned in the previous clause. The verses were perhaps originally non-Buddhistic.]</P>

<P>32. And when he had thanked the ministers in these verses he rose from his seat and departed thence. And they followed him as he went, saying, 'The gate the Sama<I>n</I>a Gotama goes out by to-day shall be called Gotama's gate, and the ferry at which he crosses the river shall be called Gotama's ferry.' And the gate he went out at was called Gotama's gate.</P>

<P>33. But the Blessed One went on to the river. And at that time the river Ganges was brimful and overflowing[1]; and wishing to cross to the opposite bank, some began to seek for boats, some for rafts of wood, while some made rafts of basket-work[2]. Then the Blessed One as instantaneously as a strong man would stretch forth his arm, or draw it back again when he had stretched it forth, vanished from this side of the river, and stood on the further bank with the company of the brethren.</P>
<P>34. And the Blessed One beheld the people looking for boats and rafts, and as he beheld them he brake forth at that time into this song:--</P><DIR>

<P>That a gloss can creep into the text, even in verses, is clear from the indisputable instance at <I>G</I>&acirc;taka II, 3 5; and the words setu<I>m</I> katv&acirc;na would have been a very natural gloss had the passage once stood as above. Then supposing that a copyist or reciter had found the words ye visa<I>gg</I>a pallal&acirc;ni setu<I>m</I> katv&acirc;na taranti a<I>nn</I>ava<I>m</I> <I>s</I>ara<I>m</I>, he might have corrected, as he thought, the order of the words so as to avoid any possibility of the words being taken to mean that the setu, the solid causeway, was made over the a<I>nn</I>ava<I>m</I> sara<I>m</I>, the vastly deep, which would be palpably absurd. Buddhaghosa found setu<I>m</I> katv&acirc;na in the text, but it is not possible to tell in what order he found the words. The Turnour MS. of the Sumangala Vil&acirc;sin&icirc; has pabandhati, but a Ceylon copy of the Samanta P&acirc;s&acirc;dik&acirc; confirms the Burmese reading bandhati at Mah&acirc; Vagga VI, 28, 13. I need scarcely say that the translation follows the printed text. We know too little about the history of the P&acirc;li Suttas to be able to do more than make a passing note of such curiosities.</P>

<P>Now the Blessed One addressed the venerable &Acirc;nanda, and said: 'Come, &Acirc;nanda, let us go on to Ko<I>t</I>ig&acirc;ma.'</P>
<P>'So be it, Lord!' said &Acirc;nanda, in assent, to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>The Blessed One proceeded with a great company of the brethren to Ko<I>t</I>ig&acirc;ma; and there he stayed in the village itself[1].</P>
<P>2. And at that place the Blessed One addressed the brethren, and said 'It is through not understanding and grasping four Noble Truths, O brethren, that we have had to run so long, to wander so long in this weary path of transmigration, both you and I!'</P>
<P>'And what are these four?'</P>
<P>'The noble truth about sorrow; the noble truth about the cause of sorrow; the noble truth about the cessation of sorrow; and the noble truth about the path that leads to that cessation. But when these noble truths are grasped and known the craving for existence is rooted out, that which leads to renewed existence is destroyed, and then there is no more birth!'</P>
<P>3. Thus spake the Blessed One; and when the Happy One had thus spoken, then again the Teacher said:</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. As will be observed from the similar passages that follow, there is a regular sequence of clauses in the set descriptions of the Buddha's movements.

<P>'BY not seeing the four Noble Truths as they really are,<BR>

When these are grasped, the cause of birth is then removed,<BR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>4. There too, while staying at Ko<I>t</I>ig&acirc;ma, the Blessed One held that comprehensive religious discourse with the brethren on the nature of upright conduct, and of earnest contemplation, and of intelligence. 'Great is the fruit, great the advantage of earnest contemplation when set round with upright conduct. Great is the fruit, great the advantage of intellect when set round with earnest contemplation. The mind set round with intelligence is freed from the great evils,--that is to say, from sensuality, from individuality, from delusion, and from ignorance.'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>5. Now When the Blessed One had remained as long as was convenient at Ko<I>t</I>ig&acirc;ma, he addressed the venerable &Acirc;nanda, and said: 'Come, &Acirc;nanda, let us go on to the villages of N&acirc;dika.'</P>
<P>'So be it, Lord!' said &Acirc;nanda, in assent, to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>And the Blessed proceeded to the villages of N&acirc;dika with a great company of the brethren; and there, at N&acirc;dika, the Blessed One stayed at the Brick Hall[1].</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. At first N&acirc;dika is (twice) spoken of in the plural number; but then, thirdly, in the last clause, in the singular. Buddhaghosa {footnote p. 25} explains this by saying that there were two villages of the same name on the shore of the same piece of water. On the public resting-place for travellers, which in this instance bore the proud title of Brick Hall, see 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' pp. 280-285.]</P>

<P>6. And the venerable &Acirc;nanda went to the Blessed One and paid him reverence and took his seat beside him. And when he was seated, he addressed the Blessed One, and said: 'The brother named S&acirc;<I>lh</I>a has died at N&acirc;dika, Lord. Where has he been reborn, and what is his destiny? The sister named Nand&acirc; has died, Lord, at N&acirc;dika. Where is she reborn, and what is her destiny?' And in the same terms he enquired concerning the devout Sudatta, and the devout lady Su<I>g</I>&acirc;t&acirc;, the devout Kakudha, and K&acirc;linga, and Nika<I>t</I>a, and Ka<I>t</I>issabha, and Tu<I>tth</I>a, and Santu<I>tth</I>a, and Bhadda, and Subhadda.</P>
<P>7. 'The brother named S&acirc;<I>lh</I>a, &Acirc;nanda, by the destruction of the great evils has by himself, and in this world, known and realised and attained to Arahatship, and to emancipation of heart and to emancipation of mind. The sister named Nand&acirc;, &Acirc;nanda, has, by the complete destruction of the five bonds that bind people to this world, become an inheritor of the highest heavens, there to pass entirely away, thence never to return. The devout Sudatta, &Acirc;nanda, by the complete destruction of the three bonds, and by the reduction to a minimum of lust, hatred, and delusion has become a Sakad&acirc;g&acirc;min, who on his first return to this world will make an end of sorrow.

<P>salvation[1]. The devout Kakudha, &Acirc;nanda, by the complete destruction of the five bonds that bind people to these lower worlds of lust, has become an inheritor of the highest heavens, there to pass entirely away, thence never to return. So also is the case with K&acirc;linga, Nika<I>t</I>a, Ka<I>t</I>issabha, Tu<I>tth</I>a, Santu<I>tth</I>a, Bhadda, and Subhadda, and with more than fifty, devout men of N&acirc;dika. More than ninety devout men of N&acirc;dika, who have died, &Acirc;nanda, have by the complete destruction of the three bonds, and by the reduction of lust, hatred, and delusion, become Sakad&acirc;g&acirc;mins, who on their first return to this world will make an end of sorrow. More than five hundred devout men of N&acirc;dika who have died. &Acirc;nanda, have by the complete destruction of the three bonds become converted, are no longer liable to be reborn in a state of suffering, and are assured of final salvation.</P>
<P>8. 'Now there is nothing strange in this, &Acirc;nanda, that a human being should die, but that as each one does so you should come to the Buddha, and enquire about them in this manner, that is wearisome to the Buddha. I will, therefore, teach you a way of truth, called the Mirror of Truth, which if an elect disciple possess he may himself predict of himself, "Hell is destroyed for me, and rebirth as an animal, or a ghost, or in any place of woe. I am converted, I am no longer liable to be reborn in a state of suffering, and am assured of final salvation."</P>
<P>9. 'What then, &Acirc;nanda, is this mirror of truth? It is the consciousness that the elect disciple is in this world possessed of faith in the Buddha--</P>

And that he (the disciple) is possessed of faith in the Order--believing the multitude of the disciples of the Blessed One who are walking in the four stages of the noble eightfold path, the righteous, the upright, the just, the law-abiding--believing this church of the Buddha to be worthy of honour, of hospitality, of gifts, and of reverence; to be the supreme sowing ground of merit for the world; to be possessed of the virtues beloved by the good, virtues unbroken, intact, unspotted, unblemished, virtues which make men truly free, virtues which are praised by the wise, are untarnished by the desire of future life or by the belief in the efficacy of outward acts, and are conducive to high and holy thought[1].'</P>
<P>10. 'This, &Acirc;nanda, is the way, the mirror of truth, which if an elect disciple possess he may himself predict of himself: "Hell is destroyed for me; and rebirth as an animal, or a ghost, or in any place of woe. I am converted; I am no longer liable to be reborn in a state of suffering, and am assured of final salvation."'</P>

<P>'Great is the fruit, great the advantage of earnest contemplation when set round with upright conduct.

<P>12. Now when the Blessed One had remained as long as he wished at N&acirc;dika, he addressed &Acirc;nanda, and said: 'Come, &Acirc;nanda, let us go on to Ves&acirc;li.'</P>
<P>'So be it, Lord!' said &Acirc;nanda, in assent, to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>Then the Blessed One proceeded, with a great company of the brethren, to Ves&acirc;li; and there at Ves&acirc;li the Blessed One stayed at Ambap&acirc;li's grove.</P>
<P>13. Now there the Blessed One addressed the brethren, and said: 'Let a brother, O mendicants, be mindful and thoughtful; this is our instruction to you.'</P>
<P>14. 'And how does a brother become mindful?'</P>
<P>'Herein, O mendicants, let a brother, as he dwells in the body, so regard the body that he, being strenuous, thoughtful, and mindful, may, whilst in the world, overcome the grief which arises from bodily craving--while subject to sensations, let him continue so to regard the sensations that he, being strenuous, thoughtful, and mindful, may, whilst in the world, overcome the grief arising from the craving--which follows our sensation-and so also</P>

<P>as he thinks or reasons or feels let him overcome the grief which arises from the craving due to ideas, or reasoning, or feeling.'</P>
<P>15. 'And how does a brother become thoughtful?'</P>
<P>'He acts, O mendicants, in full presence of mind whatever he may do, in coming out and coming in, in looking and watching, in bending in his arm or stretching it forth, in wearing his robes or carrying his bowl, in eating and drinking, in consuming or tasting, in walking or standing or sitting, in sleeping or waking, in talking and in being silent.</P>
<P>'Thus let a brother, O mendicants, be mindful and thoughtful; this is our instruction to you[1].'</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This doctrine of being 'mindful and thoughtful'--sato sampa<I>g</I>&acirc;no--is one of the lessons most frequently inculcated in the P&acirc;li Pi<I>t</I>akas, and is one of the 'Seven jewels of the Law.' It is fully treated of in each of the Nik&acirc;yas, forming the subject of the Mah&acirc; Satipa<I>tth</I>&acirc;na Sutta in the D&icirc;gha Nik&acirc;ya, and the Satipa<I>tth</I>&acirc;na Sutta of the Ma<I>ggh</I>ima Nik&acirc;ya, and the Satipa<I>tth</I>&acirc;na Vaggo of the Sa<I>m</I>yutta Nik&acirc;ya, as well as of various passages in the A<U>n</U>guttara Nik&acirc;ya and of the work called Vibha<U>n</U>ga in the Abhidhamma Pi<I>t</I>aka. I am glad to learn that Dr. Morris intends to collect and compare all these passages in his forthcoming work on the 'Seven jewels of the Law.' These sections of the Mah&acirc;parinibb&acirc;na Sutta and the treatment in the Vibha<U>n</U>ga have preserved, in Dr. Morris's opinion, the oldest form of the doctrine. Compare Chap. II, § 34.</P>
<P>Buddhaghosa has no comment here on the subject itself, reserving what he has to say for the comment on the Suttas devoted entirely to it; but he observes in passing that the reason why the Blessed One laid stress, at this particular time and place, on the necessity of being 'mindful and thoughtful,' was because of the imminent approach of the beautiful courtezan in whose grove they were staying. The use of the phrase sati upa<I>tth</I>&acirc;petabb&acirc; below, Chap. V, § 13 (text. p. 51), in reference to the way in which women should be treated, is quite in accordance with this explanation. But see the next note.]</P>

<P>16. [1] Now the courtezan Ambap&acirc;li heard that the Blessed One had arrived at Ves&acirc;li, and was staying at her mango grove. And ordering a number of magnificent vehicles to be made ready, she mounted one of them, and proceeded with her train towards her garden. She went in the carriage as far as the ground was passable for carriages; there she alighted; and she proceeded on foot to the place where the Blessed One was, and took her seat respectfully on one side. And when she was thus seated the Blessed One instructed, aroused, incited, and gladdened her with religious discourse.</P>
<P>17. Then she--instructed, aroused, incited, and gladdened with his words--addressed the Blessed One, and said:</P>
<P>'May the Blessed One do me the honour of taking his meal, together with the brethren, at my house to-morrow.'</P>
<P>And the Blessed One gave, by silence, his consent. Then when Ambap&acirc;li the courtezan saw that the Blessed One had consented, she rose from her seat and bowed down before him, and keeping him on her right hand as she past him, she departed thence.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. From this point down to the words 'he rose from his seat,' in § II, 24, is, with a few unimportant variations, word for word the same as Mah&acirc; Vagga VI, 30, 1, to VI, 30, 6. But the passage there follows immediately after the verses translated above, § I, 34, so that the events here (in §§ 16-22) localised at Ves&acirc;li, are there localised at Ko<I>t</I>ig&acirc;ma. Our section II, 5 is then inserted between our sections II, 22 and II, 23; and our section II, 12 does not occur at all, the Blessed One only reaching Ambap&acirc;li's grove when he goes there (as in our section II, 23) to partake of the meal to which he had been invited. Buddhaghosa passes over this discrepancy in silence.]</P>

<P>18. Now the Li<I>kkh</I>avis of Ves&acirc;li heard that the Blessed One had arrived at Ves&acirc;li, and was staying at Ambap&acirc;li's grove. And ordering a number of magnificent carriages to be made ready, they mounted one of them and proceeded with their train to Ves&acirc;li. Some of them were dark, dark in colour, and wearing dark clothes and ornaments: some of them were fair, fair in colour, and wearing light clothes and ornaments: some of them were red, ruddy in colour, and wearing red clothes and ornaments: some of them were white, pale in colour, and wearing white clothes and ornaments.</P>
<P>19. And Ambap&acirc;li drove up against the young Likkhavis, axle to axle, wheel to wheel, and yoke to yoke, and the Likkhavis said to Ambap&acirc;li the courtezan, 'How is it, Ambap&acirc;li, that thou drivest up against us thus?'</P>
<P>'My Lords, I have just invited the Blessed One and his brethren for their morrow's meal,' said she.</P>
<P>'Ambap&acirc;li! give up this meal to us for a hundred thousand,' said they.</P>
<P>'My Lords, were you to offer all Ves&acirc;li with its subject territory', I would not give up so honourable a feast!'</P>
<P>Then the Likkhavis cast up their hands[2], exclaiming, 'We are outdone by this mango girl! we are out-reached by this mango girl[3]!' and they went on to Ambap&acirc;li's grove.</P>
<P>20. When the Blessed One saw the Likkhavis</P>

<P>approaching in the distance, he addressed the brethren, and said:</P>
<P>'O brethren, let those of the brethren who have never seen the T&acirc;vati<I>m</I>sa gods, gaze upon this company of the Li<I>kkh</I>avis, behold this company of the Li<I>kkh</I>avis, compare this company of the Li<I>kkh</I>avis--even as a company of T&acirc;vati<I>m</I>sa gods[1].'</P>
<P>21. And when they had ridden as far as the ground was passable for carriages, the Li<I>kkh</I>avis alighted there, and then went on&nbsp;on foot to the place where the Blessed One was, and took their seats respectfully by his side. And when they were thus seated the Blessed One instructed and roused and incited and gladdened them with religious discourse[2].</P>
<P>22. Then they instructed and roused and incited and gladdened with his words, addressed the Blessed One, and said, 'May the Blessed One do us the honour of taking his meal, together with the brethren, at our house to-morrow?'</P>
<P>'O Li<I>kkh</I>avis, I have promised to dine to-morrow with Ambap&acirc;li the courtezan,' was the reply.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The T&acirc;vati<I>m</I>sa-dev&acirc; are the gods in the heaven of the Great Thirty-Three, the principal deities of the Vedic Pantheon. Buddhaghosa says, 'Ima<I>m</I> Li<I>kkh</I>avi-parisa<I>m</I> tumh&acirc;ka<I>m</I> <I>k</I>ittena T&acirc;vati<I>m</I>sa-parisa<I>m</I> upasa<I>m</I>haratha upanetha alliy&acirc;petha: Yath' eva hi T&acirc;vati<I>m</I>s&acirc; abhir&ucirc;pa p&acirc;s&acirc;dik&acirc; n&icirc;l&acirc;di-n&acirc;na-va<I>nn</I>&acirc; eva<I>&ntilde;</I> <I>k'</I> ime Li<I>kkh</I>avi-r&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;no p&icirc;ti.

<P>2 The M&acirc;l&acirc;la<U>n</U>k&acirc;ra-vatthu gives the substance of the discourse on this occasion. 'The princes had come in their finest and richest dress; in their appearance they vied in beauty with the nats (or angels). But foreseeing the ruin and misery that was soon to come upon them all, the Buddha exhorted his disciples to entertain a thorough contempt for things that are dazzling to the eyes, but essentially perishable and unreal in their nature.'--Bigandet, 2nd ed. p. 260.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_33"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 33</FONT></A></P>
<P>Then the Li<I>kkh</I>avis cast up their hands, exclaiming, 'We are outdone by this mango girl! we are outreached by this mango girl!' And expressing their thanks and approval of the words of the Blessed One, they rose from their seats and bowed down before the Blessed One, and keeping him on their right hand as they past him, they departed thence.</P>
<P>23. And at the end of the night Ambap&acirc;li the courtezan made ready in her mansion sweet rice and cakes, and announced the time to the Blessed One, saying, 'The hour, Lord, has come, and the meal is ready!'</P>
<P>And the Blessed One robed himself early in the morning, and took his bowl, and went with the brethren to the place where Ambap&acirc;li's dwelling house was: and when he had come there he seated himself on the seat prepared for him. And Ambap&acirc;li the courtezan set the sweet rice and cakes before the order, with the Buddha at their head, and waited upon them till they refused any more.</P>
<P>24. And when the Blessed One had quite finished his meal, the courtezan had a low stool brought, and sat down at his side, and addressed the Blessed One, and said: 'Lord, I present this mansion to the order of mendicants, of which the Buddha is the chief.' And the Blessed One accepted the gift; and after instructing, and rousing, and inciting, and gladdening her with religious discourse, he rose from his seat and departed thence[1].</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Bishop Bigandet says: 'In recording the conversion of a courtezan named Apapalika, her liberality and gifts to Budha and his disciples, and the preference designedly given to her over princes and nobles, who, humanely speaking, seemed in every respect better entitled to attentions--one is almost reminded of {footnote p. 34} the conversion of "a woman that was a sinner," mentioned in the Gospels' (Legend of the Burmese Budha, 2nd ed. p. 258).]</P>

<P>25. While at Ambap&acirc;li's mango grove the Blessed One held that comprehensive religious discourse with the disciples on the nature of upright conduct, and of earnest contemplation, and of intelligence.</P>
<P>'Great is the fruit, great the advantage of earnest contemplation when set round with upright conduct. Great is the fruit, great the advantage of intellect when set round with earnest contemplation. The mind set round with intelligence is freed from the great evils, that is to say, from sensuality, from individuality, from delusion, and from ignorance.'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>26. Now when the Blessed One had remained as long as he wished at Ambap&acirc;li's grove, he addressed &Acirc;nanda, and said: 'Come, &Acirc;nanda, let us go on to Beluva[1].'</P>
<P>'So be it, Lord,' said &Acirc;nanda, in assent, to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>Then the Blessed One proceeded, with a great company of the brethren, to Beluva, and there the Blessed One stayed in the village itself.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>27. Now the Blessed One there addressed the brethren, and said: 'O mendicants, do you take up your abode round about Ves&acirc;li, each according to the place where his friends, intimates, and close companions may live, for the rainy season of vassa. I shall enter upon the rainy season here at Beluva.'</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Beluva-g&acirc;mako ti Ves&acirc;li-sam&icirc;pe p&acirc;da-g&acirc;mako, 'a village on a slope at the foot of a hill near Ves&acirc;li,' says Buddhaghosa. (S. V. <I>t</I>au.)]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_35"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 35</FONT></A></P>
<P>So be it, Lord!' said those brethren, in assent, to the Blessed One. And they entered upon the rainy season round about Ves&acirc;li, each according to the place where his friends or intimates or close companions lived: whilst the Blessed One stayed even there at Beluva.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>28. Now when the Blessed One had thus entered upon the rainy season, there fell upon him a dire sickness, and sharp pains came upon him, even unto death. But the Blessed One, mindful and self-possessed, bore them without complaint.</P>
<P>29. Then this thought occurred to the Blessed One, 'It would not be right for me to pass away from existence without addressing the disciples, without taking leave of the order. Let me now, by a strong effort of the will, bend this sickness down again, and keep my hold on life till the allotted time be come[1].'</P>
<P>30. And the Blessed One, by a strong effort of the will, bent that sickness down again, and kept his hold on life till the time he fixed upon should come. And the sickness abated upon him.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>31. Now very soon after the Blessed One began to recover; when he had quite got rid of the sickness, he went out from the monastery, and sat down behind the monastery on a seat spread out there. And the venerable &Acirc;nanda went to the place where the Blessed One was, and saluted him, and took a seat respectfully on one side, and addressed the</P>

And though at the sight of the sickness of the Blessed One my body became weak as a creeper, and the horizon became dim to me, and my faculties were no longer clear[1], yet notwithstanding I took some little comfort from the thought that the Blessed One would not pass away from existence until at least he had left instructions as touching the order.'</P>
<P>32. 'What, then, &Acirc;nanda? Does the order expect that of me? I have preached the truth without making any distinction between exoteric and esoteric doctrine: for in respect of the truths, &Acirc;nanda, the Tath&acirc;gata has no such thing as the closed fist of a teacher, who keeps some things back[2]. Surely, &Acirc;nanda, should there be any one who harbours the thought, "It is I who will lead the brotherhood," or, "The order is dependent upon me," it is he who</P>

Now the Tath&acirc;gata, &Acirc;nanda, thinks not that it is he who should lead the brotherhood, or that the order is dependent upon him. Why then should he leave instructions in any matter concerning the order? I too, O &Acirc;nanda, am now grown old, and full of years, my journey is drawing to its close, I have reached my sum of days, I am turning eighty years of age; and just as a worn-out cart, &Acirc;nanda, can only with much additional care be made to move along, so, methinks, the body of the Tath&acirc;gata can only be kept going with much additional care[1].

The whole episode from § II, 27 to the end of the chapter occurs also word for word in the Satipa<I>tth</I>&acirc;na Vagga of the Samyutta Nik&acirc;ya, and the Burmese Phayre MS. there reads vekhamissakena, as the Burmese MS. does here. My D&icirc;gha Nik&acirc;ya confirms Childers's reading, which no doubt correctly represents the uniform tradition of the Ceylon MSS. The Sumangala Vil&acirc;sin&icirc; goes on, ma<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>e ti <I>g</I>ara-saka<I>t</I>a<I>m</I> viya meghamissakena ma<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>e y&acirc;peti arahatta-phalaveghanena <I>k</I>atu-iriy&acirc;patha-kappana<I>m</I> Tath&acirc;gatassa hoti nidasseti. Here the reading megha of the Turnour MS. must be a copyist's slip of the pen for vegha, and veghanena is no clearer than veghamissakena. On the use of the word missaka at the end of a compound see <I>G</I>&acirc;taka II, 8, 420, 433. I have translated on what seems to me the only solution at present possible, namely, that an initial <I>a</I> has been dropt, and that vegh&acirc; or vekh&acirc; = aveksh&acirc;, 'attention, foresight, care.' In the same way though avala<I>&ntilde;g</I>eti does occur (<I>G</I>&acirc;taka I, 111), the more usual form in P&acirc;li, and the only one given by Childers, is vala<I>&ntilde;g</I>eti.]</P>

The last words, 'but they must be anxious to learn,' seem to me to be an after thought. It is only those who are thoroughly determined to work out their own salvation, without looking for safety to any one else, even to the Buddha himself, who will, whilst in the world, enter into and experience Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a.

Now the Blessed One robed himself early in the morning, and taking his bowl in the robe, went into Ves&acirc;li for alms, and when he returned he sat down on the seat prepared for him, and after he had finished eating the rice he addressed the venerable &Acirc;nanda, and said: 'Take up the mat, &Acirc;nanda; I will go to spend the day at the <I>K</I>&acirc;p&acirc;la <I>K</I>etiya.'</P>

So the Blessed One proceeded to the <I>K</I>&acirc;p&acirc;la <I>K</I>etiya, and when he had come there he sat down on the mat spread out for him, and the venerable &Acirc;nanda took his seat respectfully beside him. Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable &Acirc;nanda, and said: 'How delightful a spot, &Acirc;nanda, is Ves&acirc;li, and the Udena <I>K</I>etiya, and the Gotamaka <I>K</I>etiya, and the Sattambaka <I>K</I>etiya, and the Bahuputta <I>K</I>etiya, and the S&acirc;randada <I>K</I>etiya, and the <I>K</I>&acirc;p&acirc;la <I>K</I>etiya.</P>

<P>2. Iddhi. The four paths are, 1. Will, 2. effort, 3. thought, and 4. investigation, each united to earnest thought and the struggle against sin. The Iddhi reached by them is supposed in works on Buddhism to be a bodily condition (power of flying, &amp;c.), by which the body rose superior to all the ordinary limitations of {footnote p. 41} matter--a bodily condition corresponding to the mental condition of exaltation and power by which it was reached. On this curiously perverted exaggeration of the real influence of the mind over the body see, further, the translator's Buddhism,' pp. 174-17 7. Two of the string of participles--y&acirc;nikat&acirc;, which may possibly mean 'made use of as a vehicle,' and susam&acirc;raddh&acirc;, 'most thoroughly ascended up to'--might seem to allude to Iddhi as a power of flying bodily through the air. But the whole set of participles is used elsewhere of conditions of mind highly esteemed among the Buddhists, and incapable of giving support to any such allusion. So, for instance, of universal love (mett&acirc;) at <I>G</I>&acirc;taka II, 61.]</P>

But even though a suggestion so evident and a hint so clear were thus given by the Blessed One, the venerable &Acirc;nanda was incapable of comprehending them; and he besought not the Blessed One, saying, 'Vouchsafe, Lord, to remain during the kalpa! Live on through the kalpa, O Blessed One! for the good and the happiness of the great multitudes, out of pity for the world, for the good and the gain and the weal of gods and men!' So far was his heart possessed by the Evil One[1].</P>

My MS. of the D&icirc;gha Nik&acirc;ya and the Turnour MS. of the Sumangala Vilasin&icirc; read pari<I>v</I>u<I>tth</I>ita, and either spelling is correct. The {footnote p. 42} fact is that the <I>y</I> or <I>v</I> in such cases is even less than euphonic; it is an assistance not to the speaker, but merely to the writer. Thus in the Si<I>&ntilde;</I>halese duwanaw&acirc;, 'to run,' the spoken word is duanaw&acirc;, and the <I>w</I> is written only to avoid the awkward use in the middle of a word of the initial sign for the sound <I>a</I>. That the speakers of P&acirc;li found no difficulty in pronouncing two vowels together is abundantly proved by numerous instances. The writers of P&acirc;li, in those cases in which the second vowel begins a word, use without hesitation the initial sign; but in the middle of the word this would be so ungainly that they naturally prefer to insert a consonantal sign to carry the vowel sign. The varying readings I have pointed out are a strong confirmation of the correctness of the pronunciation of modern native scholars; and we may the more readily adopt it as the question is not really one concerning the pronunciation of P&acirc;li, but concerning the use which modern native copyists make of their own alphabet. I would pronounce therefore pari-u<I>tth</I>ita-<I>k</I>itto.]</P>

<P>5. A second and a third time did the Blessed One [say the same thing, and a second and a third time was &Acirc;nanda's heart thus hardened].</P>
<P>6. Now the Blessed One addressed the venerable &Acirc;nanda and said: 'You may leave me, &Acirc;nanda, awhile, and do whatever seemeth to thee fit.'</P>
<P>'So be it, Lord!' said the venerable &Acirc;nanda, in assent, to the Blessed, and rising from his seat he saluted the Blessed One, and passing him on the right, sat down at the foot of a certain tree not far off thence.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>7. Now not long after the venerable &Acirc;nanda had been gone, M&acirc;ra, the Evil One, approached the Blessed One, and stood beside him. And so standing there, he addressed the Blessed One in these words:</P>
<P>'Pass away now, Lord, from existence; let the Blessed One now die. Now is the time for the Blessed One to pass away--even according to the</P>
<P><A NAME="page_43"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 43</FONT></A></P>
<P>word which the Blessed One spoke: when he said[1]: "I shall not die, O Evil One! until the brethren and sisters of the order, and until the lay-disciples of either sex[2] shall have become true hearers, wise and well-trained, ready and learned, versed in the Scriptures, fulfilling all the greater and the lesser duties, correct in life, walking according to the precepts--until they, having thus themselves learned the doctrine, shall be able to tell others of it, preach it, make it known, establish it, open it, minutely explain it and make it clear--until they, when others start vain doctrine, shall be able by the truth to vanquish and refute it, and so to spread the wonderworking truth abroad!"'</P>
<P>8. 'And now, Lord, the brethren and sisters of the order and the lay-disciples of either sex have become [all this], are able to do [all this]. Pass away now therefore, Lord, from existence; let the Blessed One now die! The time has come for the Blessed One to pass away-even according to the word which he spake when he said, "I shall not die, O Evil One! until this pure religion of mine shall have become successful, prosperous, widespread, and popular in all its full extent--until, in a word, it shall have been well proclaimed to men," And now, Lord, this pure religion of thine has become [all this].

The words here quoted were spoken by the Buddha, after he had been enjoying the first bliss of Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, under the shepherd's Nigrodha tree (see my 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' pp. 109-111). The Evil One then also tempted him to die (see below, paragraph III, 43), and this was his reply.</P>
<P>2. The whole paragraph is repeated, here and below, for each of these classes of persons.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_44"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 44</FONT></A></P>
<P>existence; let the Blessed One now die! The time has come for the Blessed One to pass away!'</P>
<P>9. And when he had thus spoken, the Blessed One addressed M&acirc;ra, the Evil One, and said: 'O Evil One! make thyself happy, the final extinction of the Tath&acirc;gata shall take place before long. At the end of three months from this time the Tath&acirc;gata will die!'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>10. Thus the Blessed One while at the <I>K</I>&acirc;p&acirc;la <I>K</I>etiya deliberately and consciously rejected the rest of his allotted sum of life. And on his so rejecting, it there arose a mighty earthquake, awful and terrible, and the thunders of heaven burst forth. And when the Blessed One beheld this, he broke out at that time into this hymn of exultation:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'His sum of life the sage renounced,<BR>
The cause of life immeasurable or small;<BR>
With inward joy and calm, he broke,<BR>
Like coat of mail, his life's own cause!'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>11. Now the following thought occurred to the venerable &Acirc;nanda: 'Wonderful indeed and marvellous is it that this mighty earthquake should arise, awful and terrible, and that the thunders of heaven should burst forth! What may be the proximate, what the remote cause of the appearance of this earthquake?'</P>
<P>12. Then the venerable &Acirc;nanda went up to the place where the Blessed One was, and did obeisance to the Blessed One, and seated himself respectfully at one side, and said: 'Wonderful indeed and marvellous is it that this mighty earthquake should arise, awful and terrible, and that the thunders of</P>
<P><A NAME="page_45"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 45</FONT></A></P>
<P>heaven should burst forth! What may be the proximate, what the remote cause of the appearance of this earthquake?'</P>
<P>13. 'Eight are the proximate, eight the remote causes, &Acirc;nanda, for the appearance of a mighty earthquake. What are the eight? This great earth, &Acirc;nanda, is established on water, the water on wind, and the wind rests upon space. And at such a time, &Acirc;nanda, as the mighty winds blow, the waters are shaken by the mighty winds as they blow, and by the moving water the earth is shaken. These are the first causes, proximate and remote, of the appearance of a mighty earthquake.</P>
<P>14. 'Again, &Acirc;nanda, a Sama<I>n</I>a or a Br&acirc;hman of great (intellectual) power, arid who has the feelings of his heart well under his control; or a god or fairy (devat&acirc;[1]) of great might and power,--when such a</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Devat&acirc; is a fairy, god, genius, or angel. I am at a loss how to render this word without conveying an erroneous impression to those not familiar with ancient ideas, and specially with ancient Buddhist ideas, of the spirit world. It includes gods of all sorts; tree and river nymphs; the kindly fairies or ghosts who haunt houses (see my 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' Tale No. 40); spirits in the ground (see above, § I, 26); the angels who minister at the great renunciation, the temptation, and the death of the Buddha; the guardian angels who watch over men, and towns, and countries; and many other similar beings. 'Celestial being' would be wholly inapplicable, for instance, to the creatures referred to in the curious passage above (§ I, 26). 'Superhuman being' would be an inaccurate rendering; for all these light and airy shapes come below, and after, man in the Buddhist order of precedence. 'Spirit' being used of the soul inside the human body, and of the human soul after it has left the body, and figuratively of mental faculties--none of which are included under devat&acirc;--would suggest ideas inconsistent with that of the P&acirc;li word. As there is therefore no appropriate general word I have chosen, for each passage where the expression occurs, the word used in English of the special class {footnote p. 46} more particularly referred to in the passage of the text. Here all kinds of devat&acirc;s being referred to, and there being, no word in English for them all, I have ventured to put the word devat&acirc; into my version, and to trouble the reader with this note.]</P>

<P>one by intense meditation of the finite idea of earth or the infinite idea of water (has succeeded in realising the comparative value of things[1]) he can make this earth move and tremble and be shaken violently.

<P>15. 'Again, &Acirc;nanda, when a Bodhisatta consciously and deliberately leaves his temporary form in the heaven of delight and descends into his mother's womb, then is this earth made to quake and tremble and is shaken violently.

There is no doubt a real truth in the idea that deep thought can shake the universe, and make the palaces of the gods to tremble, just as faith is said in Matthew xxi. 21 to be able to remove mountains, and cause them to be cast into the sea. But these figurative expressions have, in Buddhism, become a fruitful soil for the outgrowth of superstitions and misunderstandings; and the train of early Buddhist speculation in this field has yet to be elucidated. There is much about it in the Mah&acirc; Padh&acirc;na Sutta of the D&icirc;gha Nik&acirc;ya, where Chap. III, §§ 11-20 recur.</P>
<P>2. The Bodhisatta's voluntary incarnation is looked upon by the Buddhists as a great act of renunciation, and curious legends have {footnote p. 47} gathered about it. One is that on the night when she conceived his mother dreamt that a white elephant entered her side. The account will be found at length in my 'Buddhist Birth Stories' (pp. 62-64), and the earthquake is there mentioned in terms identical with those in the text. The sacred event is also one of those represented on the ancient bas-reliefs round the Bharhut Th&ucirc;pa, a full description of which will be found in General Cunningham's most interesting work, 'The Stupa of Bharhut.' General Cunningham says of the description placed above this sculpture: 'Above it in large characters is inscribed Bhagavato r&ucirc;kdanta, which may perhaps be translated, "Buddha as the sounding elephant," from ru, to sound, to make a particular sort of sound.' Now the first word of the inscription is in the genitive case, so that if the second word could mean an elephant, the whole would signify, 'The Buddha's, elephant.' But the characters which General Cunningham reads r&ucirc;kdanta are, I venture to suggest, okkanti (? &ucirc;kkanti); and the inscription simply says, 'The descent of the blessed One.' As I have pointed out in 'Buddhism' (p. 184), the white elephant legend is one of those hallowed sun stories by which half-converted Hindus have striven to embellish the life story of the Teacher whose followers they had become. In the Lalita Vistara. (Calc. ed. p. 63) the entrance of the elephant into M&acirc;y&acirc; precedes the dream; but though the ignorant may have therefore accepted it as a fact, it is of course only a figure of speech--and I venture to think from the Hindu standpoint, a beautiful figure of speech--to express the incarnation of divine mildness and majesty in a human form. The use of such a figure is not confined to India. In the earliest of the Apocryphal Gospels, the Gospel according to the Hebrews, the incarnation of the divine gentleness and love is expressed by saying that a dove from heaven 'entered into' the human form.]</P>

But they knew me not even when I vanished away; and would say, "Who may this be who has thus vanished away? a man or a god?"'</P>
<P>23. [And in the same words the Blessed One spake of how he had been used to enter into assemblies of each of the other of the eight kinds, and of how he had not been made known to them either in speaking or in vanishing away.] 'Now these, &Acirc;nanda, are the eight assemblies.'</P>

<P>This and the next paragraph are based upon the Buddhist belief as to the long-vexed question between the Indian schools who represented more or less closely the European Idealists and Realists. When cleared of the many repetitions inserted for the benefit of the repeaters or reciters, the fundamental idea seems to be that the great necessity is to get rid of the delusion that what one sees and feels is real and permanent. Nothing is real and permanent but character.</P>
<P>The so-called eight Positions of Mastery are merely an expansion of the first two of the following eight Stages of Deliverance, and the whole argument is also expressed in another form in the {footnote p. 50} passage on the nine successive 'Cessations,' of which an abstract will be found in Childers, sub voce nirodha.</P>
<P>The two lists have been translated and commented upon by Burnouf (Lotus de la Bonne Loi, pp. 543, 824-832), who took the texts from the Mah&acirc;nid&acirc;na Sutta and the Sang&icirc;ti Sutta respectively. The former has been reprinted in Grimblot's Sept Suttas P&acirc;lis, where the passage will be found at pp. 261, 262. I regret that in my interpretation I have been compelled to differ so greatly from Burnouf. Though I have devoted much care and time to the subject, I do not suppose that I have understood it better than he did. We cannot hope to get to the bottom of what these old Buddhists thought about matter and mind from such curt lists as these.]</P>

But even when a suggestion so evident and a hint so clear were thus given thee by the Tath&acirc;gata, thou wast yet incapable of comprehending them, and thou besoughtest not the Tath&acirc;gata, saying, 'Vouchsafe, Lord, to remain during the kalpa. Live on, O Blessed One! through the kalpa for the good and the happiness of the great multitudes, out of pity for the world, for the good and the gain and the weal of gods and men.' If thou shouldst then have so besought the Tath&acirc;gata, the Tath&acirc;gata might have rejected the appeal even to the second time, but the third time he would have granted it. Thine, therefore, O &Acirc;nanda, is the fault, thine is the offence!"</P>

No such condition can exist! And this mortal being, &Acirc;nanda, has been relinquished, cast away, renounced, rejected, and abandoned by the Tath&acirc;gata. The remaining sum of life has been surrendered by him. Verily, the word has gone forth from the Tath&acirc;gata, saying, "The final extinction of the Tath&acirc;gata shall take place before long. At the end of three months from this time the Tath&acirc;gata will die!" That the Tath&acirc;gata for the sake of living should repent him again of that saying--this can no wise be[1]!'</P>

<P>'Even so, Lord,' said the venerable &Acirc;nanda, in assent, to the Blessed One.

And standing beside him, he addressed the Blessed One, and said:</P>
<P>'Lord! the assembly of the brethren has met together. Let the Blessed One do even as seemeth to him fit.'</P>
<P>65. Then the Blessed One proceeded to the Service Hall, and sat down there on the mat spread out for him. And when he was seated the Blessed One addressed the brethren, and said:</P>
<P>'Therefore, O brethren--ye to whom the truths I have perceived have been made known by me--having thoroughly made yourselves masters of them, practise them, meditate upon them, and spread them abroad; in order that pure religion may last long and be perpetuated, in order that it may continue to be for the good and happiness of the great multitudes, out of pity for the world, to the good and the gain and the weal of gods and men!</P>

<P>These, O brethren, are the truths which, when I had perceived, I made known to you, which, when you have mastered it behoves you to practise, meditate upon, and spread abroad, in order that pure religion may last long and be perpetuated, in order that it may continue to be for the good and the happiness of the great multitudes, out of pity for the world, to the good and the gain and the weal of gods and men!</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Dhamma and vinaya. The Buddhist religion, as just summarised, and the regulations of the order.</P>
<P>2 It is of great interest to notice what are the points upon which Gotama, in this last address to his disciples, and at the solemn time when death was so near at hand, is reported to have lain such emphatic stress. Unfortunately we have only a fragment of the address, and, as it would seem from its commencement, only the closing fragment. This, however, is in the form of a summary, consisting of an enumeration of certain aggregates, the details of which must have been as familiar to the early Buddhists as the details of similar numerical terms--such as the ten commandments, the twelve tribes, the seven deadly sins, the four gospels, and so on--afterwards were to the Christians. This summary of the Buddha's last address may fairly be taken as a summary of Buddhism, which thus appears to be simply a system of earnest self-culture and self-control.</P>
<P>The following are the details of the aggregate technical terms used in the above summary, but it will be understood that the English equivalents used give rather a general than an exact representation of the ideas expressed by the P&acirc;li ones. To attempt more would demand a treatise rather than a note, and it has given me peculiar pleasure to learn, as these sheets are passing through the press, that my friend Dr. Morris intends to devote a book to the treatment of these seven 'Jewels of the Law,' as the <I>K</I>ulla Vagga calls them (IX, 1, 4), which form, when united, the bright diadem of Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a.</P>
<P>The four Earnest Meditations (<I>k</I>att&acirc;ro Satipa<I>tth</I>&acirc;n&acirc;) are--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1. Meditation on the body.<BR>
2. Meditation on the sensations.<BR>
3. Meditation on the ideas.<BR>
4. Meditation on reason and character.</P></DIR>

<P>{footnote p. 63}</P>
<P>The fourfold Great Struggle against sin is divided into <I>k</I>att&acirc;ro Samappadh&acirc;n&acirc;, which are--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1. The struggle to prevent sinfulness arising.<BR>
2. The struggle to put away sinful states which have arisen.<BR>
3. The struggle to produce goodness not previously existing.<BR>
4. The struggle to increase goodness when it does exist.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The four Roads to Saintship are four means by which Iddh&icirc; (see above, § 3, note) is to be acquired. They are the <I>K</I>att&acirc;ro Iddhip&acirc;d&acirc;:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1. The will to acquire it united to earnest meditation and the struggle against sin.<BR>
2. The necessary exertion united to earnest meditation and the struggle against sin.<BR>
3. The necessary preparation of the heart united to earnest meditation and the struggle against sin.<BR>
4. Investigation united to earnest meditation and the struggle against sin.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The five moral powers (pa<I>&ntilde;k</I>a Bal&acirc;ni) are said to be the same as the next class, called organs (Indriy&acirc;ni). It is no doubt most remarkable that, in a summary like this, two classes out of seven should be absolutely identical except in name. The difference of name is altogether too unimportant to account, by itself, for the distinction made. Either the currently accepted explanation of one of the two aggregate terms must be incorrect, or we must look for some explanation of the repetition other than the mere desire to record the double title. Is it impossible that the one class was split into two to bring the number of the classes up to the sacred number seven, corresponding to the seven Ratanas of a <I>K</I>akkavatti?</P>
<P>The details of both classes are--</P>
<P>1. Faith. 2. Energy. 3. Thought. 4. Contemplation. 5. Wisdom.</P>
<P>The seven kinds of Wisdom (satta Bo<I>ggh</I>ang&acirc;) are--</P>
<P>1. Energy. 2. Thought. 3. Contemplation. 4. Investigation (of scripture). 5. Joy. 6. Repose. 7. Serenity.</P>
<P>The Noble Eightfold Path (ariyo a<I>tth</I>angiko Maggo) forms the subject of the Dhamma-<I>k</I>akka-ppavattana-Sutta, translated in this volume, and consists of--</P>
<P>1. Right views. 2. High aims. 3. Right speech. 4. Upright conduct. 5. A harmless livelihood. 6. Perseverance in well-doing. 7. Intellectual activity. 8. Earnest thought.]</P>

<P>1. Now the Blessed One early in the morning robed himself, and taking his bowl, entered Ves&acirc;li for alms: and when he had passed through Ves&acirc;li, and had eaten his meal and was returning from his alms-seeking he gazed at Ves&acirc;li with an elephant look[1] and addressed the venerable &Acirc;nanda, and said: 'This will be the last time, &Acirc;nanda, that the Tath&acirc;gata will behold Ves&acirc;li. Come, &Acirc;nanda, let us go on to Bha<I>nd</I>a-g&acirc;ma.'</P>
<P>'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable &Acirc;nanda, in assent, to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>And the Blessed One proceeded with a great company of the brethren to Bha<I>nd</I>a-g&acirc;ma; and there the Blessed One stayed in the village itself.</P>
<P>2. There the Blessed One addressed the brethren, and said: 'It is through not understanding and grasping four truths[2], O brethren, that we have had to run so long, to wander so long in this weary path of transmigration--both you and I.'</P>
<P>'And what are these four? The noble conduct of life, the noble earnestness in meditation, the noble kind of wisdom, and the noble salvation of freedom.

<P>4. There too, while staying at Bha<I>nd</I>a-g&acirc;ma, the Blessed One held that comprehensive religious discourse with the brethren on the nature of upright conduct, and of earnest contemplation, and of intelligence. 'Great is the fruit, great the advantage of earnest contemplation when set round with upright conduct.

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This is merely a stock phrase for introducing verses which repeat the idea of the preceding phrase (see above, paragraph 32). It is an instructive sign of the state of mind in which such records are put together, that these verses could be ascribed to Gotama himself without any feeling of the incongruity involved. The last word means, completely gone out; and here refers to the extinction of kilesa and ta<I>n</I>h&acirc;, which will bring about, inevitably, the extinction of being. Compare the passage quoted by Burnouf in Lotus de la Bonne Loi, p. 376. Probably the whole stanza formerly stood in some other connection, where the word parinibbuto had its more usual sense.

<P>Even so, Lord!' said &Acirc;nanda, in assent, to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>Then the Blessed One proceeded with a great company of the brethren to Hatthi-g&acirc;ma.</P>

Without praise and without scorn every word and syllable should be carefully understood, and then put beside the scripture and compared with the rules of the order[1].

<P>14. Now <I>K</I>unda, the worker in metals, heard that the Blessed One had come to P&acirc;v&acirc;, and was staying there in his Mango Grove.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_71"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 71</FONT></A></P>
<P>And <I>K</I>unda, the worker in metals, went to the place where the Blessed One was, and saluting him took his seat respectfully on one side. And when he was thus seated, the Blessed One instructed, aroused, incited, and gladdened him with religious discourse.</P>
<P>15. Then he, instructed, aroused, incited, and gladdened by the religious discourse, addressed the Blessed One, and said: 'May the Blessed One do me the honour of taking his meal, together with the brethren, at my house to-morrow.'</P>
<P>And the Blessed One signified, by silence, his consent.</P>
<P>16. Then seeing that the Blessed One had consented, <I>K</I>unda, the worker in metals, rose from his seat and bowed down before the Blessed One, and keeping him on his right hand as he past him, departed thence.</P>
<P>17. Now at the end of the night, <I>K</I>unda, the worker in metals, made ready in his dwelling-place sweet rice and cakes, and a quantity of dried boar's flesh. And he announced the hour to the Blessed One, saying, 'The hour, Lord, has come, and the meal is ready.'</P>
<P>18. And the Blessed One robed himself early in the morning, and taking his bowl, went with the brethren to the dwelling-place of <I>K</I>unda, the worker in metals. When he had come thither he seated himself on the seat prepared for him. And when he was seated he addressed <I>K</I>unda, the worker in metals, and said: 'As to the dried boar's flesh you have made ready, serve me with it, <I>K</I>unda; and as to the other food, the sweet rice and cakes, serve the brethren with it.'</P>
<P><A NAME="page_72"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 72</FONT></A></P>
<P>'Even so, Lord!' said <I>K</I>unda, the worker in metals, in assent, to the Blessed One. And the dried boar's flesh he had made ready he served to the Blessed One; whilst the other food, the sweet rice and cakes, he served to the members of the order.</P>
<P>19. Now the Blessed One addressed Kunda, the worker in metals, and said: 'Whatever dried boar's flesh, <I>K</I>unda, is left over to thee, that bury in a hole. I see no one, <I>K</I>unda, on earth nor in M&acirc;ra's heaven, nor in Brahma's heaven, no one among Sama<I>n</I>as and Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, among gods and men, by whom, when he has eaten it, that food can be assimilated, save by the Tath&acirc;gata.'</P>
<P>'Even so, Lord!' said <I>K</I>unda, the worker in metals, in assent, to the Blessed One. And whatever dried boar's flesh remained over, that he buried in a hole.</P>
<P>20. And he went to the place where the Blessed One was; and when he had come there, took his seat respectfully on one side. And when he was seated, the Blessed One instructed and aroused and incited and gladdened <I>K</I>unda, the worker in metals, with religious discourse. And the Blessed One then rose from his seat and departed thence.</P>
<P>21. Now when the Blessed One had eaten the food prepared by <I>K</I>unda, the worker in metal, there fell upon him a dire sickness, the disease of dysentery, and sharp pain came upon him, even unto death. But the Blessed One, mindful and self-possessed, bore it without complaint.</P>
<P>22. And the Blessed One addressed the venerable &Acirc;nanda, and said: 'Come, &Acirc;nanda, let us go on to Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;.'</P>
<P><A NAME="page_73"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 73</FONT></A></P>
<P>'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable &Acirc;nanda, in assent, to the Blessed One.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>23. When he had eaten <I>K</I>unda's food,<BR>
The copper-smith's--thus have I heard--<BR>
He bore with fortitude the pain,<BR>
The sharp pain even unto death!</P>
<P>And from the dried flesh of the boar, as soon as he had eaten it,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There fell upon the teacher sickness dire,<BR>
Then after nature was relieved the Blessed One announced and said:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now am going on to Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;[1].'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>24. Now the Blessed One went aside from the path to the foot of a certain tree; and when he had come there he addressed the venerable &Acirc;nanda, and said: 'Fold, I pray you, &Acirc;nanda, the robe; and spread it out for me. I am weary, &Acirc;nanda, and must rest awhile!'</P>
<P>'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable &Acirc;nanda, in assent, to the Blessed One, and spread out the robe folded fourfold.</P>
<P>25. And the Blessed One seated himself on the seat prepared for him; and when he was seated, he addressed the venerable &Acirc;nanda, and said: 'Fetch me, I pray you, &Acirc;nanda, some water. I am thirsty, &Acirc;nanda, and would drink.'</P>
<P>26. When he had thus spoken, the venerable &Acirc;nanda said to the Blessed One: 'But just now,</P>

<P>Lord, about five hundred carts have gone over. That water stirred up by the wheels has become shallow and flows fouled and turbid. This river Kakutth&acirc;, Lord, not far off, is clear and pleasant, cool and transparent, easy to get down into, and delightful.

<P>27. Again the second time the Blessed One addressed the venerable &Acirc;nanda, and said: 'Fetch me, I pray you, &Acirc;nanda, some water. I am thirsty, &Acirc;nanda, and would drink.'</P>
<P>28. And again the second time the venerable &Acirc;nanda said to the Blessed One: 'But just now, Lord, about five hundred carts have gone over.

<P>29. Again the third time the Blessed One addressed the venerable &Acirc;nanda, and said: 'Fetch me, I pray you, &Acirc;nanda, some water. I am thirsty, &Acirc;nanda, and would drink.'</P>
<P>30. 'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable &Acirc;nanda, in assent, to the Blessed One; and taking a bowl he went down to the streamlet. And lo! the streamlet which, stirred up by the wheels, was but just now become shallow, and was flowing fouled and turbid, had begun, when the venerable &Acirc;nanda came up to it, to flow clear and bright and free from all turbidity.</P>

<P>31. Then &Acirc;nanda thought: 'How wonderful, how marvellous is the great might and power of the Tath&acirc;gata! For this Streamlet which, stirred up by the wheels, was but just now become shallow and flowing foul and turbid, now, as I come up to it, is flowing clear and bright and free from all turbidity.'</P>
<P>32. And taking water in the bowl he returned towards the Blessed One; and when he had come where the Blessed One was he said to him: 'How wonderful, how marvellous is the great might and power of the Tath&acirc;gata! For this streamlet which, stirred up by the wheels, was but just now become shallow and flowing foul and turbid, now, as I come up to it, is flowing clear and bright and free from all turbidity. Let the Blessed One drink the water! Let the Happy One drink the water!'</P>
<P>Then the Blessed One drank of the water.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>33. Now at that time a man named Pukkusa[1] a young Mallian, a disciple of &Acirc;<I>l</I>&acirc;ra K&acirc;l&acirc;ma's, was passing along the high road from Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; to P&acirc;v&acirc;.</P>
<P>34. And Pukkusa, the young Mallian, saw the Blessed One seated at the foot of a tree. On seeing him, he went up to the place where the Blessed One was, and when he had come there he saluted the Blessed One, and took his rest respectfully on one side. And when he was seated</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The Pukkusa caste was one of the lower castes of S&ucirc;dras. Compare Ass&acirc;l&acirc;yana Sutta (Pischel), pp. 13, 35; Burnouf's 'Introduction,' &amp;c., pp. 144, 208; Lalita Vistara XXI, 17. But Buddhaghosa says Pukkusa must here be simply a name, as the Mallas were of the Khattiya caste. He adds that this Pukkusa was the owner of the five hundred carts that had just passed by; and that &Acirc;<I>l</I>&acirc;ra K&acirc;l&acirc;ma was called &Acirc;<I>l</I>&acirc;ra because he was D&icirc;gha-pi<U>n</U>galo, K&acirc;l&acirc;ma being his family name.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_76"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 76</FONT></A> Pukkusa, the young Mallian, said to the Blessed One: 'How wonderful a thing is it, Lord! and how marvellous, that those who have gone forth out of the world should pass their time in a state of mind so calm!'</P>
<P>35. 'Formerly, Lord, &Acirc;<I>l</I>&acirc;ra K&acirc;l&acirc;ma a was once walking along the high road; and leaving the road he sat himself down under a certain tree to rest during the heat of the day. Now, Lord, five hundred carts passed by one after the other, each close to &Acirc;<I>l</I>&acirc;ra K&acirc;l&acirc;ma. And a certain man, who was following close behind that caravan of carts, went up to the place where &Acirc;<I>l</I>&acirc;ra K&acirc;l&acirc;ma, was, and when he was come there he spake as follows to &Acirc;<I>l</I>&acirc;ra K&acirc;l&acirc;ma:</P>
<P>'"But, Lord, did you see those five hundred carts go by?"</P>
<P>'"No, indeed, sir, I saw them not."</P>
<P>'"But, Lord, did you hear the sound of them?"</P>
<P>'"No, indeed, sir, I heard not their sound."</P>
<P>'"But, Lord, were you then asleep?"</P>
<P>'"No, sir, I was not asleep."</P>
<P>'"But, Lord, were you then conscious?"</P>
<P>'"Yes, I was conscious, sir."</P>
<P>'"So that you, Lord, though you were both conscious and awake, neither saw, nor heard the sound of five hundred carts passing by, one after the other, and each close to you. Why, Lord, even your robe was sprinkled over with the dust of them!"</P>
<P>'"It is even so, sir."</P>
<P>36. 'Then thought that man: "How wonderful a thing is it, and how marvellous, that those who have gone forth out of the world should pass their time in a state of mind so calm! So much so that a man though being both conscious and awake,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_77"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 77</FONT></A></P>
<P>neither sees, nor hears the sound of five hundred carts passing by, one after the other, and each close to him."</P>
<P>'And after giving utterance to his deep faith in &Acirc;<I>l</I>&acirc;ra K&acirc;l&acirc;ma, he departed thence.'</P>
<P>37. 'Now what think you, Pukkusa, which is the more difficult thing either to do or to meet with--that a man being conscious and awake should neither see, nor hear the sound of five hundred carts passing by, one after the other, close to him,--or that a man, being conscious and awake, should neither see, nor hear the sound thereof when the falling rain goes on beating and splashing, and the lightnings are flashing forth, and the thunderbolts are crashing?'</P>
<P>38. 'What in comparison, Lord, can these five hundred carts do, or six or seven or eight or nine or ten hundred, yea, even hundreds and thousands of carts. That certainly is more difficult, both to do and to meet with, that a man being conscious and awake should neither see, nor hear the sound thereof when the falling rain goes on beating and splashing, and the lightnings are flashing forth, and the thunderbolts are crashing.'</P>
<P>39. 'Now on one occasion, Pukkusa, I was dwelling at &Acirc;tum&acirc;, and was at the Threshing-floor[1]. And at that time the falling rain begun to beat and to splash, and the lightnings to flash forth, and the thunderbolts to crash; and two peasants, brothers, and four oxen were killed. Then, Pukkusa, a great multitude of people went forth from &Acirc;tum&acirc;, and went up to the place where the two peasants, brothers, and the four oxen, lay killed.</P>

</FONT><P><A NAME="page_78"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 78</FONT></A></P>
<P>40. 'Now at that time, Pukkusa, I had gone forth from the Threshing-floor, and was walking up and down thinking at the entrance to the Threshing-floor. And a certain man came, Pukkusa, out of that great multitude of people, up to the place where I was; and when he came up he saluted me, and took his place respectfully on one side.</P>
<P>41. 'And as he stood there, Pukkusa, I said to the man:</P>
<P>'"Why then, sir, is this great multitude of people assembled together?"</P>
<P>'"But just now, the falling rain began to beat and to splash, and the lightnings to flash forth, and the thunderbolts to crash; and two peasants, brothers, were killed, and four oxen. Therefore is this great multitude of people gathered together. But where, Lord, were you?"</P>
<P>'"I, sir, have been here all the while."</P>
<P>'"But, Lord, did you see it?"</P>
<P>'"I, sir, saw nothing."</P>
<P>'"But, Lord, did you hear it?"</P>
<P>'"I, sir, heard nothing."</P>
<P>'"Were you then, Lord, asleep?"</P>
<P>'"I, sir, was not asleep."</P>
<P>'"Were you then conscious, Lord?"</P>
<P>'"Even so, sir."</P>
<P>'"So that you, Lord, being conscious and awake, neither saw, nor heard the sound thereof when the falling rain went on beating and splashing, and the lightnings were flashing forth, and the thunderbolts were crashing."</P>
<P>'"That is so, sir."</P>
<P>42. 'Then, Pukkusa, the thought occurred to that man:</P>
<P><A NAME="page_79"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 79</FONT></A></P>
<P>'"How wonderful a thing is it, and marvellous, that those who have gone forth out of the world should pass their time in a state of mind so calm!--so that a man being conscious and awake neither sees nor hears the sound thereof when the falling rain is beating and splashing, and the lightnings are flashing forth, and the thunderbolts are crashing." And after giving utterance to his deep faith in me, he departed from me with the customary demonstrations of respect.'</P>
<P>43. And when he had thus spoken Pukkusa, the young Mallian, addressed the Blessed One in these words: 'Now I, Lord, as to the faith that I had in &Acirc;<I>l</I>&acirc;ra K&acirc;l&acirc;ma, that I winnow away as in a mighty wind, and wash it away as in a swiftly running stream. Most excellent, Lord, are the words of thy mouth, most excellent! Just as if a man were to set up that which is thrown down, or were to reveal that which is hidden away, or were to point out the right road to him who has gone astray, or were to bring a lamp into the darkness, so that those who have eyes can see external forms-just even so, Lord, has the truth been made known to me, in many a figure, by the Blessed One. And I, even I, betake myself, Lord, to the Blessed One as my refuge, to the Truth, and to the Brotherhood. May the Blessed One accept me as a disciple, as a true believer, from this day forth, as long as life endures[1]!'</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This is a stock phrase constituting the final answer of a hitherto unconverted man at the end of one of those argumentative dialogues by which Gotama overcame opposition or expounded the truth. After a discussion of exalted themes it fits in very appropriately; here and elsewhere it is incongruous and strained. See below, V, 50.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_80"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 80</FONT></A></P>
<P>44. Now Pukkusa, the young Mallian, addressed a certain man, and said: 'Fetch me, I pray you, my good man, a pair of robes of cloth of gold, burnished and ready for wear.'</P>
<P>'So be it, sir!' said that man, in assent, to Pukkusa, the young Mallian; and he brought a pair of robes of cloth of gold, burnished and ready for wear.</P>
<P>45. And the Mallian Pukkusa presented the pair of robes of cloth of gold, burnished and ready for wear, to the Blessed One, saying, 'Lord, this pair of robes of burnished cloth of gold is ready for wear. May the Blessed One show me favour and accept it at my hands!'</P>
<P>'In that case, Pukkusa, robe me in one, and &Acirc;nanda in one.'</P>
<P>'Even so, Lord!' said Pukkusa, in assent, to the Blessed One; and in one he robed the Blessed One, and in one, &Acirc;nanda.</P>
<P>46. Then the Blessed One instructed and aroused and incited and gladdened Pukkusa, the young Mallian, with religious discourse. And Pukkusa, the young Mallian, when he had been instructed and aroused and incited and gladdened by the Blessed One with religious discourse, arose from his seat, and bowed down before the Blessed One; and keeping him on his right hand as he past him, departed thence.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>47. Now not long after the Mallian Pukkusa had &Acirc;nanda placed that pair of robes of cloth of gold, burnished and ready for wear, on the body of the Blessed One, and when it was so</P>
<P><A NAME="page_81"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 81</FONT></A></P>
<P>placed on the body of the Blessed One it appeared to have lost its splendour[1]!</P>
<P>48. And the venerable &Acirc;nanda said to the Blessed One: 'How wonderful a thing is it, Lord, and how marvellous, that the colour of the skin of the Blessed One should be so clear, so exceeding bright! For when I placed even this pair of robes of burnished cloth of gold and ready for wear on the body of the Blessed One, lo! it seemed as if it had lost its splendour!'</P>
<P>49. 'It is even so, &Acirc;nanda. &Acirc;nanda, there: are two occasions on which the colour of the skin of a Tath&acirc;gata becomes clear and exceeding bright. What are the two?'</P>
<P>50. 'On the night, &Acirc;nanda, on which a Tath&acirc;gata attains to the supreme and perfect insight, and on the night in which he passes finally away in that utter passing away which leaves nothing whatever to remain--on these two occasions the colour of the skin of the Tath&acirc;gata becomes clear and exceeding bright.</P>
<P>51. 'And now this day, &Acirc;nanda, at the third watch of the night, in the Upavattana of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;, in the S&acirc;la Grove of the Mallians, between the twin S&acirc;la</P>

<P>'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable &Acirc;nanda, in assent, to the Blessed One.</P><DIR>

<P>52. The pair of robes of cloth of gold,<BR>
All burnished, Pukkusa had brought,<BR>
Clad on with them the Master then<BR>
Shone forth in colour like to gold[1]!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>53. Now the Blessed One with a great company of the brethren went on to the river Kakutth&acirc;; and when he had come there, he went down into the water, and bathed, and drank. And coming up out again on the other side he went on to the Mango Grove.</P>
<P>54. And when he was come there he addressed the venerable <I>K</I>undaka, and said: 'Fold, I pray you, <I>K</I>undaka, a robe in four and spread it out. I am weary, <I>K</I>undaka, and would lie down.'</P>
<P>'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable <I>K</I>undaka, in assent, to the Blessed One. And he folded a robe in four, and spread it out.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. We have here the commencement of the legend which afterwards grew into an account of an actual 'transfiguration' of the Buddha. It is very curious that it should have taken place soon after the Buddha had announced to &Acirc;nanda his approaching death, and that in the Buddhist Sutta it should be connected so closely with that event; for a similar remark applies also to the Transfiguration mentioned in the Gospels. The M&acirc;l&acirc;<U>n</U>k&acirc;ra-vatthu, for instance, says, 'His body appeared shining like a flame. &Acirc;nanda was exceedingly surprised. Nothing of this kind had, as yet, happened. "Your exterior appearance," said he to Budha, "is all at once white, shining, and beautiful above all expression." "What you say, O &Acirc;nanda, is perfectly true. There are two occasions [&amp;c., much as above]. The shining light emanating from my body is a certain forerunner of this great event [his Parinibb&acirc;na]."]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_83"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 83</FONT></A></P>
<P>55. And the Blessed One laid himself down on his right side, with one foot resting on the other; and calm and self-possessed, he meditated on the idea of rising up again in due time. And the venerable Kundaka seated himself there in front of the Blessed One.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>56. The Buddha to Kakutth&acirc;'s river came,<BR>
Whose clear and pleasant waters limpid flow,<BR>
He plunged beneath the stream wearied and worn,<BR>
The Buddha without equal in the world!<BR>
When he had bathed and drunk, the teacher then<BR>
Crossed o'er, the brethren thronging round his steps;<BR>
The Blessed Master, preaching the while the truth,<BR>
The Mighty Sage came to the Mango Grove.<BR>
There spake he to the brother <I>K</I>undaka:<BR>
'Spread me the fourfold robe out as a couch.'<BR>
Cheered by the Holy One, he quickly spread<BR>
The fourfold robe in order on the ground.<BR>
The Master laid him down, wearied and worn;<BR>
And there, before him, <I>K</I>unda took his seat.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>57. And the Blessed One addressed the venerable &Acirc;nanda, and said: 'Now it may happen, &Acirc;nanda, that some one should stir up remorse in <I>K</I>unda the smith, by saying, "This is evil to thee, <I>K</I>unda, and loss to thee in that when the Tath&acirc;gata had eaten his last meal from thy provision, then he died." Any such remorse, &Acirc;nanda, in <I>K</I>unda the smith should be checked by saying, "This is good to thee, <I>K</I>unda, and gain to thee, in that when</P>
<P><A NAME="page_84"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 84</FONT></A></P>
<P>the Tath&acirc;gata had eaten his last meal from thy provision, then he died. From the very mouth of the Blessed One, <I>K</I>unda, have I heard, from his own mouth have I received this saying, 'These two offerings of food are of equal fruit, and of equal profit, and of much greater fruit and much greater profit than any other--and which are the two? The offering of food which, when a Tath&acirc;gata has eaten, he attains to supreme and perfect insight; and the offering of food which, when a Tath&acirc;gata has eaten, he passes away by that utter passing away in which nothing whatever remains behind--these two offerings of food are of equal fruit and of equal profit, and of much greater fruit and much greater profit than any others. There has been laid up by <I>K</I>unda the smith a karma redounding to length of life, redounding to good birth, redounding to good fortune, redounding to good fame, redounding to the inheritance of heaven, and of sovereign power.'" In this way, &Acirc;nanda, should be checked any remorse in <I>K</I>unda the smith.'</P>
<P>58. Then the Blessed One perceiving how the matter stood, uttered, even at that time, this hymn of exultation:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>To him who gives shall virtue be increased;<BR>
In him who curbs himself, no anger can arise;<BR>
The righteous man casts off all sinfulness,<BR>
And by the rooting out of lust, and bitterness,<BR>
And all delusion, doth to Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a reach!'</P></DIR>

It is most curious to find this exact analogy to the notorious discussion as to how many angels could stand on the point of a needle in a commentary written at just that period of Buddhist history which corresponds to the Middle Ages of Christendom. The passage in the text does not really imply or suggest any such doctrine, though the whole episode is so absurd that the author of the text could not have hesitated to say so, had such an idea been the common belief of the early Buddhists.

<P>2. King of kings is an inadequate rendering of <I>K</I>akkavatti R&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;. It is a king whose power no other king can dispute, who is the acknowledged overlord in India. The idea can scarcely have existed before <I>K</I>andragupta, the first <I>K</I>akravarti, had raised himself to power.

That pho<I>t</I>ita is here the participle of the causal verb, and not of the simple verb, follows of necessity from its being used as an explanation of vihata, 'torn to pieces.'

As ka<I>m</I>sa is already a common word for bronze in very early Buddhist P&acirc;li texts, I think &acirc;yasa or ayasa must here mean 'of iron.' When Buddhaghosa says it is here a name for gold, we can only conclude that iron had become, in his time, a metal which he might fairly consider too base for the purpose proposed.]</P>

<P>41. When he had thus spoken[1], the venerable &Acirc;nanda said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P>'Let not the Blessed One die in this little wattel and daub town, in this town in the midst of the jungle, in this branch township[2]. For, Lord, there are other great cities, such as <I>K</I>amp&acirc;, R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha, S&acirc;vatthi, S&acirc;keta, Kosambi, and Ben&acirc;res. Let the Blessed One die in one of them. There&nbsp;there are many wealthy nobles and Br&acirc;hmans and heads of houses, believers in the Tath&acirc;gata, who will pay due honour to the remains of the Tath&acirc;gata[3].'</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. From here down to the end of section 44 is found also, nearly word for word, in the beginning of the Mah&acirc;-Sudassana Sutta, translated below; compare also Mah&acirc;-Sudassana <I>G</I>&acirc;taka, No. 95.</P>
<P>2 Ku<I>dd</I>a-nagarake ti pa<I>t</I>ir&ucirc;pake samb&acirc;dhe khuddakanagare: Ugga<U>n</U>gala-nagarake ti visama-nagarake. (S.V. fol. <I>th</I>au.) Ku<I>dd</I>a, if this explanation be right, seems to be merely an old and unusual form for kshudra, and the Burmese correction into khudda to be unnecessary: but I venture to think it is more likely to be = ku<I>d</I>ya, and to mean a wall built of mud and sticks, or what is called in India, of wattel and daub. When Buddhaghosa explains u<I>gg</I>a<U>n</U>gala as 'lawless,' he is expressing his view that a town in the jungle is likely to be a heathen, pagan sort of place.</P>
<P>3 With reference to Childers's note in his Dictionary on mah&acirc;s&acirc;l&acirc;, with which every one must entirely agree, Buddhaghosa's {footnote p. 100} explanation of the word will be interesting as a proof (if proof be needed) that the Ceylon scholars are not always trustworthy. He says, Khattiya-mah&acirc;s&acirc;l&acirc; ti khattiya-mah&acirc;s&acirc;r&acirc; s&acirc;rapatt&acirc; mah&acirc;-khattiy&acirc;. Eso nayo sabbattha.]</P>

<P>42. 'Say not so, &Acirc;nanda! Say not so, &Acirc;nanda, that this is but a small wattel and daub town, a town in the midst of the jungle, a branch township. Long ago, &Acirc;nanda, there was a king, by name Mah&acirc;-Sudassana, a king of kings, a righteous man who ruled in righteousness, Lord of the four quarters of the earth, conqueror, the protector of his people, possessor of the seven royal treasures. This Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;, &Acirc;nanda, was the royal city of king Mah&acirc;-Sudassana, under the name of Kus&acirc;vat&icirc;, and on the east and on the west it was twelve leagues in length, and on the north and on the south it was seven leagues in breadth.</P>
<P>43. 'That royal city Kus&acirc;vat&icirc;, &Acirc;nanda, was mighty, and prosperous, and full of people, crowded with men, and provided with all things for food[1]. Just, &Acirc;nanda, as the royal city of the gods, &Acirc;<I>l</I>akamand&acirc; by name, is mighty, prosperous, and full of people, crowded with the gods, and provided with all kinds of food, so, &Acirc;nanda, was the royal city Kus&acirc;vat&icirc; mighty and prosperous, full of people, crowded with men, and provided with all kinds of food.</P>
<P>44. 'Both by day and by night, &Acirc;nanda, the royal city Kus&acirc;vat&icirc; resounded with the ten cries; that is to say, the noise of elephants, and the noise of horses, and the noise of chariots; the sounds of the</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>45. 'Go now, &Acirc;nanda, and enter into Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;, and inform the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;, saying, "This day, O V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>as, in the last watch of the night, the final passing away of the Tath&acirc;gata will take place. Be favourable herein, O V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>as, be favourable. Give no occasion to reproach yourselves hereafter, saying, 'In our own village did the death of our Tath&acirc;gata take place, and we took not the opportunity of visiting the Tath&acirc;gata in his last hours.'"'</P>
<P>'Even so, Lord,' said the venerable &Acirc;nanda, in assent, to the Blessed One; and he robed himself, and taking his bowl[2], entered into Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; attended by another member of the order.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This enumeration is found also at <I>G</I>&acirc;taka, p. 3, only that the conch shell is added there-wrongly, for that makes the number of cries eleven. The Mah&acirc;-Sudassana Sutta has in the corresponding passage, like the Burmese MS. noted here by Childers, conch instead of cymbal. My MS. reads cymbal here.</P>
<P>2. Niv&acirc;setv&acirc; patta-<I>k</I>&icirc;vara<I>m</I> &acirc;d&acirc;ya atta-dutiyo. Buddhaghosa has, naturally enough, no comment on this oft-recurring phrase. It cannot be meant that he put on only his under-garments, and carried his upper robe with him; for then his shoulders would have been bare; and it is quite against the rules to go into a village without all the robes having been put carefully on (P&acirc;timokkha, Sekhiya 1-3). I do not even understand how &Acirc;nanda, with due regard to the rules of the brotherhood (see P&acirc;timokkha, Nisaggiya 21-29), could have had a spare robe then with him. And patta-<I>k</I>&icirc;varam can scarcely mean simply 'bowl-robe,' referring to the length of cotton cloth in which the bowl was carried over the shoulder ('Buddhist Birth Stories,' p. 71). 'With both his under-garments on, he entered Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; duly bowled and robed' may be impossible English, but it probably correctly catches the {footnote p. 102} idea involved, though of course one (at least) of the under-cloths had been put on long before. See p. 122. A Thera never goes about in public alone, he is always accompanied by a S&acirc;ma<I>n</I>era.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_102"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 102</FONT></A></P>
<P>46. Now at that time the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; were assembled in the council hall on some public affair[1].</P>
<P>And the venerable &Acirc;nanda went to the council hall of the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;; and when he had arrived there, he informed them, saying, 'This day, O V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>as, in the last watch of the night, the final passing away of the Tath&acirc;gata will take place. Be favourable herein, O V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>as, be favourable. Give no occasion to reproach yourselves hereafter, saying, "In our own village did the death of our Tath&acirc;gata take place, and we took not the opportunity of visiting the Tath&acirc;gata in his last hours."'</P>
<P>47. And when they had heard this saying of the venerable &Acirc;nanda, the Mallas with their young men and maidens and their wives were grieved, and sad, and afflicted at heart. And some of them wept, dishevelling their hair, and stretched forth their arms and wept, fell prostrate on the ground, and rolled to and fro in anguish at the thought: 'Too soon will the Blessed One die! Too soon will the Happy One pass away! Full soon will the Light of the world vanish away!'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>48. Then the Mallas, with their young men and</P>

It seems to me that he has been misled by the commentary, which really presupposes the more correct division adopted by Childers.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_103"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 103</FONT></A></P>
<P>maidens and their wives, being grieved and sad and afflicted at heart, went to the S&acirc;la Grove of the Mallas, to the Upavattana, and to the place where the venerable &Acirc;nanda was.</P>
<P>49. Then the venerable &Acirc;nanda thought: 'If I allow the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;, one by one, to pay their respects to the Blessed One, the whole of the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; will not have been presented to the Blessed One until this night brightens up into the dawn. Let me, now, cause the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; to stand in groups, each family in a group, and so present them to the Blessed One, saying, "Lord! a Malla of such and such a name, with his children, his wives, his retinue, and his friends, humbly bows down at the feet of the Blessed One."'</P>
<P>50. And the venerable &Acirc;nanda caused the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; to stand in groups, each family in a group, and so presented them to the Blessed One, and said: 'Lord! a Malla of such and such a name, with his children, his wives, his retinue, and his friends, humbly bows down at the feet of the Blessed One.'</P>
<P>51. And after this manner the venerable &Acirc;nanda presented all the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; to the Blessed One in the first watch of the night.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>52. Now at that time a mendicant named Subhadda, who was not a believer, was dwelling at Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;. And the mendicant Subhadda heard the news: 'This very day, they say, in the third watch of the night, will take place the final passing away of the Sama<I>n</I>a Gotama.'</P>
<P>53. Then thought the mendicant Subhadda: 'This have I heard from fellow mendicants of mine, old and well stricken in years, teachers and</P>
<P><A NAME="page_104"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A></P>
<P>disciples, when they said: "Sometimes and full seldom do Tath&acirc;gatas appear in the world, the Arahat Buddhas." Yet this day, in the last watch of the night, the final passing away of the Sama<I>n</I>a Gotama will take place. Now a certain feeling of uncertainty has sprung up in my mind; and this faith have I in the Sama<I>n</I>a Gotama, that he, methinks, is able so to present the truth that I may get rid of this feeling of uncertainty.'</P>
<P>54. Then the mendicant Subhadda went to the S&acirc;la Grove of the Mallas, to the Upavattana of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;, to the place where the venerable &Acirc;nanda was.</P>
<P>55. And when he had come there he said to the venerable &Acirc;nanda: 'Thus have I heard from fellow mendicants of mine, old and well stricken in years, teachers and disciples, when they said: "Sometimes and full seldom do Tath&acirc;gatas appear in the world, the Arahat Buddhas." Yet this day, in the last watch of the night, the final passing away of the Sama<I>n</I>a Gotama will take place. Now a certain feeling of uncertainty has sprung up in my mind; and this faith have I in the Sama<I>n</I>a Gotama, that he, methinks, is able so to present the truth that I may get rid of this feeling of uncertainty. O that I, even I, &Acirc;nanda, might be allowed to see the Sama<I>n</I>a Gotama!'</P>
<P>56. And when he had thus spoken the venerable &Acirc;nanda said to the mendicant Subhadda: 'Enough! friend Subhadda. Trouble not the Tath&acirc;gata. The Blessed One is weary.'</P>
<P>57. And again the mendicant Subhadda [made the same request in the same words, and received the same reply]; and the third time the mendicant Subhadda [made the same request in the same words, and received the same reply]</P>
<P><A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A></P>
<P>58. Now the Blessed One overheard this conversation of the venerable &Acirc;nanda with the mendicant Subhadda. And the Blessed One called the venerable &Acirc;nanda, and said: 'It is enough, &Acirc;nanda! Do not keep out Subhadda. Subhadda, &Acirc;nanda, may be allowed to see the Tath&acirc;gata. Whatever Subhadda may ask of me, he will ask from a desire for knowledge, and not to annoy me. And whatever I may say in answer to his questions, that he will quickly understand.'</P>
<P>59. Then the venerable &Acirc;nanda said to Subhadda, the mendicant: 'Enter in, friend Subhadda; for the Blessed One gives you leave.'</P>
<P>60. Then Subhadda, the mendicant, went in to the place where the Blessed One was, and saluted him courteously, and after exchanging with him the compliments of esteem and of civility, he took his seat on one side. And when he was thus seated, Subhadda, the mendicant, said to the Blessed One: 'The Br&acirc;hmans by saintliness of life[1], Gotama, who</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Sama<I>n</I>a-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>&acirc;, which compound may possibly mean Samanas and Brahmans as it has usually been rendered, but I think not necessarily. Not one of those here specified were Br&acirc;hmans by caste, as is apparent from the Sumangala Vil&acirc;sin&icirc; on the S&acirc;ma<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>a Phala Sutta, p. 114. Compare the use of Kshatriya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>o, 'a soldier priest,' a Kshatriya who offered sacrifice; and of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>o, absolutely, as an epithet of an Arahat. In the use of the word sama<I>n</I>a there seems to me to be a hopeless confusion between, a complete mingling of the meanings of, the two roots <I>s</I>ram and <I>s</I>am (which, in P&acirc;li, would both become sam). It connotes both asceticism and inward peace, and might best be rendered 'devotee,' were it not for the intellectual inferiority implied by that word in our language. A Sama<I>n</I>a Br&acirc;hman should therefore mean a man of any caste, who by his saintliness of life, by his renunciation of the world, and by his reputation as a religious thinker, had acquired the position of a quasi Br&acirc;hman, and {footnote p. 106} was looked up to by the people in the same way as that in which they looked up to a Br&acirc;hman by caste. Compare further my 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' vol. i. p. 260; and also Mr. Beal's remarks in the Indian Antiquary for May, 1880; and Professor Max M&uuml;ller's note on Dhammapada, verse 265.]</P>

<P>are heads of companies of disciples and students, teachers of students, well known, renowned, founders of schools of doctrine, esteemed as good men by the multitude--to wit, P&ucirc;ra<I>n</I>a Kassapa, Makkhali of the cattle-pen, A<I>g</I>ita of the garment of hair, Ka<I>kk</I>&acirc;yana of the Pakudha tree, Sa<I>&ntilde;g</I>aya the son of the Bela<I>tth</I>i slave-girl, and Niga<I>nth</I>a of the N&acirc;tha clan--have they all, according to their own assertion, thoroughly understood things? or have they not? or are there some of them who have understood, and some who have not[1]?'</P>
<P>61. 'Enough, Subhadda! Let this matter rest whether they, according to their own assertion, have thoroughly understood things, or whether they have not, or whether some of them have understood and some have not! The truth, &Acirc;nanda, will I teach you. Listen well to that, and give ear attentively, and I will speak.'</P>
<P>'Even so, Lord!' said the mendicant Subhadda, in assent, to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>62. And the Blessed One spake: 'In whatsoever doctrine and discipline, Subhadda, the noble eightfold path is not found, neither in it is there found a man of true saintliness of the first or of the second or of the third or of the fourth degree[2].</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Buddhaghosa has an exegetical note on abbha<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>amsu, but passes over those celebrated Six Teachers in silence. The little that is thus far known of them will be discussed in another place.</P>
<P>2. This refers to the four divisions of the Noble Eightfold Path. See above, chap. II, § 8, where their characters are described. The {footnote p. 107} word translated 'man of true saintliness,' or 'true saint,' is in the text Sama<I>n</I>o, on which see the note on page 105. I am at a loss how to render the word adequately here.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_107"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 107</FONT></A> And in whatsoever doctrine and discipline, Subhadda, the noble eightfold path is found, is found the man of true saintliness of the first and the second and the third and the fourth degree. Now in this doctrine and discipline, Subhadda, is found the noble eightfold path, and in it alone, Subhadda, is the man of true saintliness. Void are the systems of other teachers--void of true saints. And in this one, Subhadda, may the brethren live the Life that's Right, so that the world be not bereft of Arahats[1].</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Arahats are those who have reached Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, the 'supreme goal,' the 'highest fruit' of the Noble Eightfold Path. To live 'the Life that's Right' (samm&acirc;) is to live in the Noble Path, each of the eight divisions of which is to be samm&acirc;, round, right and perfect, normal and complete. To live right (samm&acirc;) is therefore to have--1. Right views, free from superstition. 2. Right aims, high and worthy of the intelligent and earnest man. 3. Right speech, kindly, open, truthful. 4. Right conduct, in all concerns of life. 5. Right livelihood, bringing hurt or danger to no living thing. 6. Right perseverance, in all the other seven. 7. Right mindfulness, the watchful, active mind. 8. Right contemplation, earnest thought on the deep mysteries of life. In each of these the word right is samm&acirc;, and the whole paragraph being on the Noble Path, the allusion is certainly to this central doctrine of the Buddhist Dhamma.</P>
<P>Buddhaghosa says that that bhikkhu samm&acirc; viharati, who, having himself entered the Noble Path, leads his brother into it, and this is, no doubt, good Buddhism. But it is a practical application of the text, a theological exegesis, and not a philological explanation. Even so it seems to lay the stress too much on 'bereft,' and too little on 'Arahats.'</P>

<P>Yea, not of the first, nor of the second, nor of the third, nor of the fourth degree. Void are the systems of other teachers--void of true saints. But in this one, Subhadda, may the brethren live the perfect life, that the world be not bereft of those who have reached the highest fruit.'</P>
<P>63. And when he had thus spoken, Subhadda, the mendicant, said to the Blessed One: 'Most excellent, Lord, are the words of thy mouth, most excellent! just as if a man were to set up that which is thrown down, or were to reveal that which is hidden away, or were to point out the right road to him who has gone astray, or were to bring a lamp into the darkness, so that those who have eyes can see external forms;--just even so, Lord, has the truth been made known to me, in many a figure, by the Blessed One. And I, even I, betake myself, Lord, to the Blessed One as my refuge, to the truth, and to the order. May the Blessed One accept me as a disciple, as a true believer, from this day forth, as long as life endures!'</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. I have followed, though with some doubt, Childers's punctuation. Buddhaghosa refers padesa-vatt&icirc; to sama<I>n</I>o; and ito, not to padesa, but to magga, understood; and it is quite possible that this is the correct explanation. On sam&acirc;dhik&acirc;ni see the comment at <I>G</I>&acirc;taka II, 383.]</P>

<P>64. 'Whosoever, Subhadda, that has formerly been a follower of another doctrine and then desires to be received into the higher or the lower grade in this doctrine and discipline, he remains on probation for the space of four months; and at the end of the four months, the brethren, exalted in spirit, receive him into the lower or into the higher grade of the order. Nevertheless in this case I acknowledge the difference in persons.'</P>
<P>65. 'If, Lord, whosoever that has formerly been a follower of another doctrine and then desires to be received into the higher or the lower grade in this doctrine and discipline,--if, in that case, such a person remains on probation for the space of four months; and at the end of the four months, the brethren, exalted in spirit, receive him into the lower or into the higher grade of the order--I too, then, will remain on probation for the space of four months; and at the end of the four months let the brethren, exalted in spirit, receive me into the lower or into the higher grade of the order!'</P>
<P>66. But the Blessed One called the venerable &Acirc;nanda, and said: 'As it is, &Acirc;nanda, receive Subhadda into the order!'</P>
<P>'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable &Acirc;nanda, in assent, to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>67. And Subhadda, the mendicant, said to the venerable &Acirc;nanda: 'Great is your gain, friend &Acirc;nanda, great is your good fortune, friend &Acirc;nanda, that you all have been sprinkled with the sprinkling of discipleship in this brotherhood at the hands of the Master himself!'</P>
<P>68. So Subhadda, the mendicant, was received</P>
<P><A NAME="page_110"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 110</FONT></A></P>
<P>into the higher grade of the order under the Blessed One; and from immediately after his ordination the venerable Subhadda remained alone and separate, earnest, zealous, and resolved. And e'er long he attained to that supreme goal of the higher life[1] for the sake of which men go out from all and every household gain and comfort to become houseless wanderers--yea, that supreme goal did he, by himself, and while yet in this visible world, bring himself to the knowledge of, and continue to realise, and to see face to face! And he became conscious that birth was at an end, that the higher life had been fulfilled, that all that should be done had been accomplished, and that after this present life there would be no beyond!</P>
<P>69. So the venerable Subbadda became yet another among the Arahats; and he was the last disciple whom the Blessed One himself converted[2].</P>

<P>2 Buddhaghosa says that the last five words in the text (the last twelve words in my translation) were added by the Theras who held the Council. On Subhadda's ordination he has the following interesting note: 'The Thero, (that is, &Acirc;nanda), they say, took him on one side, poured water over his head from a water vessel, made him repeat the formula of meditation on the impermanency of the body(Ta<I>k</I>a-pa<I>&ntilde;k</I>aka-kamma<I>tth</I>ana<I>m</I>; see my "Buddhist Birth Stories," p. 161), shaved off his hair and beard, clad him in the yellow robes, made him repeat the "Three Refuges," and led him back to the Blessed One. The Blessed One himself admitted him then into the higher rank of the brotherhood, and pointed out to him a subject for meditation (kamma<I>tth</I>ana<I>m</I>; see "Buddhist {footnote p. 111} Birth Stories," p. 147). He accepted this, and walking up and down in a quiet part of the grove, he thought and meditated upon it, till overcoming the Evil Spirit, he had acquired Arahatship, and with it the discriminating knowledge of all the Scriptures (Pa<I>t</I>isambhid&acirc;). Then, returning, he came and took his seat beside the Blessed One.'</P>
<P>According to this, no set ceremony for ordination (Sa<U>n</U>gha-kamma<I>m</I>), as laid down in the Vinaya, took place; and it is otherwise probable that no such ceremony was usual in the earliest days of Buddhism.]</P>

Now the Blessed One addressed the venerable &Acirc;nanda, and said: 'It may be, &Acirc;nanda, that in some of you the thought may arise, "The word of the Master is ended, we have no teacher more!"

<P>2. '&Acirc;nanda! when I am gone address not one another in the way in which the brethren have heretofore addressed each other--with the epithet, that is, of "&Acirc;vuso" (Friend). A younger brother may be addressed by an elder with his name, or his family name, or the title "Friend." But an elder should be addressed by a younger brother as "Lord" or as "Venerable Sir."</P>

<P>3. 'When I am gone, &Acirc;nanda, let the order, if it should so wish, abolish all the lesser and minor precepts[1].'</P>

In Kulla Vagga XI, 1, 9, 10, is related how the brotherhood formally considered the permission thus accorded to them, and resolved to adhere to all the precepts as laid down in the Buddha's lifetime.

<P>5. Then the Blessed One addressed the brethren, and said: 'It may be, brethren, that there may be doubt or misgiving in the mind of some brother as to the Buddha, or the truth, or the path, or the way. Enquire, brethren, freely. Do not have to reproach yourselves afterwards with the thought, "Our teacher was face to face with us, and we could not bring ourselves to enquire of the Blessed One when we were face to face with him."'</P>
<P>And when he had thus spoken the brethren were silent.</P>
<P>6. And again the second and the third time the Blessed One addressed the brethren, and said: 'It may be, brethren, that there may be doubt or misgiving in the mind of some brother as to the Buddha, or the truth, or the path, or the way. Enquire, brethren, freely.

But after the social penalty here referred to had been duly imposed upon him, even his proud and independent spirit was tamed; he became humble: his eyes were opened; and he, also, attained to the 'supreme goal' of the Buddhist faith.]</P>

<P>7. Then the Blessed One addressed the brethren, and said: 'It may be, brethren, that you put no questions out of reverence for the teacher. Let one friend communicate to another.'</P>
<P>And when he had thus spoken the brethren were silent.</P>
<P>8. And the venerable &Acirc;nanda said to the Blessed One: 'How wonderful a thing is it, Lord, and how marvellous! Verily, I believe that in this whole assembly of the brethren there is not one brother who has any doubt or misgiving as to the Buddha, or the truth, or the path, or the way!'</P>
<P>9. 'It is out of the fulness of faith that thou hast spoken, &Acirc;nanda! But, &Acirc;nanda, the Tath&acirc;gata knows for certain that in this whole assembly of the brethren there is not one brother who has any doubt or misgiving as to the Buddha, or the truth, or the path, or the way! For even the most backward, &Acirc;nanda, of all these five hundred brethren has become converted, and is no longer liable to be born in a state of suffering, and is assured of final salvation[1].'</P>

<P>14. When the Blessed One died there arose, at the moment of his passing out of existence, a mighty earthquake, terrible and awe-inspiring and the thunders of heaven burst forth.</P>
<P>15. When the Blessed One died, Brahm&acirc; Sahampati, at the moment of his passing away from existence, uttered this stanza:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'They all, all beings that have life, shall lay<BR>
Aside their complex form--that aggregation<BR>
Of mental and material qualities,<BR>
That gives them, or in heaven or on earth,<BR>
Their fleeting individuality!<BR>
E'en as the teacher--being such a one, <A NAME="page_117"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 117</FONT></A><BR>
Unequalled among all the men that are,<BR>
Successor of the prophets of old time,<BR>
Mighty by wisdom, and in insight clear--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath died[1]!'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>16. When the Blessed One died, Sakka, the king of the gods, at the moment of his passing away from existence, uttered this stanza:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'They're transient all, each being's parts and powers,<BR>
Growth is their nature, and decay.<BR>
They are produced, they are dissolved again:<BR>
And then is best, when they have sunk to rest[2]!'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Brahm&acirc;, the first cause, the highest result of Indian theological speculation, the one God of the Indian Pantheists, is represented as using expressions full of deep allusions to the most characteristic Buddhist doctrines. The Samussaya is the result of the temporary collocation of the 'aggregations' (khandh&acirc;) of mental and material qualities which give to each being (bh&ucirc;to, that is, man, animal, god, ghost, fairy, or what not) its outward and visible shape, its individuality. Loka is here not the world in our sense, but the 'locality' in the Buddhist universe which such an individual occupies until it is dissolved. (Comp. Chap. II, §§ 14, 34.) Brahm&acirc; appears therefore as a veritable Vibha<I>gg</I>av&acirc;d&icirc;.</P>
<P>2. On this celebrated verse see below the Introduction to Mah&acirc;-Sudassana Sutta. It must be the original of the first verse in the Chinese work, Fa Kheu Pi Hu (Beal, Dhammapada, p. 32), though it is there so changed that every clause has lost its point.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'Whatever exists is without endurance.<BR>
And hence the terms "flourishing" and "decaying."<BR>
A man is born, and then he dies.<BR>
Oh, the happiness of escaping from this condition!'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The very meaning which is here the most essential connotation of sa<U>n</U>kh&acirc;r&acirc; is lost in the phrase 'whatever exists.' By a misapprehension of the, no doubt, difficult word Dhamma, which, however, never means 'term,' the second clause has lost its point. And by a grammatical blunder the third clause in the Chinese confines the doctrine, erroneously, to man. In a Chinese tale, called {footnote p. 118} Ngan shih niu, translated by Mr. Beal, in the Indian Antiquary for May, 1880, the following verses occur; and they are possibly another reflection of this stanza:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'All things that exist are transitory.<BR>
They must of necessity perish and disappear;<BR>
Though joined together, there must be separation;<BR>
Where there is life there must be death.'</P></DIR>

<P>17. When the Blessed One died, the venerable Anuruddha, at the moment of his passing away from existence, uttered these stanzas:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'When he who from all craving want was free,<BR>
Who to Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a's tranquil state had reached,<BR>
When the great sage finished his span of life,<BR>
No gasping struggle vexed that steadfast heart!</P>
<P>All resolute, and with unshaken mind,<BR>
He calmly triumphed o'er the pain of death.<BR>
E'en as a bright flame dies away, so was<BR>
His last deliverance from the bonds of life[1]!'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>18. When the Blessed One died, the venerable &Acirc;nanda, at the moment of his passing away from existence, uttered this stanza:</P><DIR>

<P>'Then was there terror!<BR>

When he endowed with every grace--<BR>

<P>2. In these four stanzas we seem to have the way in which the death of the Buddha would be regarded, as the early Buddhist thought, by four representative persons--the exalted God of the theologians; the Jupiter of the multitude (allowing in the case of {footnote p. 119} each of these for the change in character resulting from their conversion to Buddhism); the holy, thoughtful Arahat; and the loving, childlike disciple.]</P>

<P>19<SUP>[1]</SUP>. When the Blessed One died, of those of the brethren who were not yet free from the passions, some stretched out their arms and wept, and some fell headlong on the ground, rolling to and fro in anguish at the thought 'Too soon has the Blessed One died! Too soon has the Happy One passed away from existence! Too soon has the Light gone out in the world!'</P>
<P>But those of the brethren who were free from the passions (the Arahats) bore their grief collected and composed at the thought 'Impermanent are all component things! How is it possible that [they should not be dissolved]?'</P>
<P>20. Then the venerable Anuruddha exhorted the brethren, and said: 'Enough, my brethren! Weep not, neither lament! Has not the Blessed One formerly declared this to us, that it is in the very nature of all things near and dear unto us, that we must divide ourselves from them, leave them, sever ourselves from them? How then, brethren, can this be possible--that whereas anything whatever born, brought into being, and organised, contains within itself the inherent necessity of dissolution--how then can this be possible that such a being should not be dissolved? No such condition can exist! Even the spirits, brethren, will reproach us[2].'</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Nearly = V, 11-14; and below, VI, 39.</P>
<P>2. U<I>ggh</I>&acirc;yanti. I have followed the reading of my own MS., which is confirmed by the Sumangala Vil&acirc;sin&icirc; and the M&acirc;l&acirc;la<U>n</U>k&acirc;ra-vatthu. Vi<I>ggh</I>&acirc;yanti, which Childers reads, would be questionable Buddhism. The spirits do not become extinct; that is, not as a general rule, as would be implied by the absolute statement, {footnote p. 120} 'Even the spirits, brethren, become extinct.' It is no doubt true that all spirits, from the lowest to the highest, from the most insignificant fairy to the God of theological speculation, are regarded as temporary. But when they cease to exist as gods or spirits (devat&acirc;), they do not go out, they are not extinguished (vi<I>ggh</I>&acirc;yanti); they continue to exist in some other form. And though that other form would, from the European point of view, be a different being, as there would be no continuity of consciousness, no passage of a 'soul' from the one to the other; it would, from the Buddhist point of view, be the same being, as it would be the resultant effect of the same Karma. There would follow on the death of a devat&acirc;, not extinction, but a transmutation of force, a transmigration of character, a passing on, an inheritance of Karma. Only in the exceedingly rare case of an an&acirc;g&acirc;min, of which an instance will be found above, Chap. II, § 7, could it be said that a spirit becomes extinct.</P>
<P>The expression 'of worldly mind,' here and above in V, 11, is in P&acirc;li pa<I>th</I>avi-sa<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>iniyo, an ambiguous phrase which has only been found in this connection. Buddhaghosa says merely, 'because they made (m&acirc;petv&acirc;) an earth in heaven.' This gloss again may be taken either in a figurative or in a literal sense; but, if not impossible, it is at least unlikely that the good commentator means calmly to state that the angels created a floor in the skies--for the greater convenience of tumbling! The word seems to me also to be opposed to vitar&acirc;g&acirc;, 'free from passion,' and I have therefore taken it in a spiritual sense. There is a third possibility, viz. that it is used in an intellectual sense, 'having the idea of the world present to their mind;' and this would be in accordance with the more usual use of sa<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>&icirc;. But how easily, especially in Buddhism, the intellectual merges into the religious may be seen from such a phrase as mara<I>n</I>a-sa<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>ino, used at Mah&acirc;va<I>m</I>sa 33.

<P>'But of what kind of spirits is the Lord, the venerable Anuruddha, thinking?'</P>
<P>21. 'There are spirits, brother &Acirc;nanda, in the sky, but of worldly mind, who dishevel their hair and weep, and stretch forth their arms and weep, fall prostrate on the ground, and roll to and fro in anguish at the thought: "Too soon has the</P>

<P>'There are spirits, too, &Acirc;nanda, on the earth, and of worldly mind, who tear their hair and weep, and stretch forth their arms and weep, fall prostrate on the ground, and roll to and fro in anguish at the thought: "Too soon has the Blessed one died! Too soon has the Happy One passed away! Too soon has the Light gone out in the world!"</P>
<P>'But the spirits who are free from passion bear it, calm and self-possessed, mindful of the saying which begins, "Impermanent indeed are all component things. How then is it possible [that such a being should not be dissolved]?"'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>22. Now the venerable Anuruddha and the venerable &Acirc;nanda spent the rest of that night in religious discourse. Then the venerable Anuruddha said to the venerable &Acirc;nanda: 'Go now, brother &Acirc;nanda, into Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; and inform the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;, saying, 'The Blessed One, O V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>as, is dead: do, then, whatever seemeth to you fit!'</P>
<P>'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable &Acirc;nanda, in assent, to the venerable Anuruddha. And having robed himself early in the morning, he took his bowl, and went into Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; with one of the brethren as an attendant.</P>
<P>23. Now at that time the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; were assembled in the council hall concerning that very matter.</P>
<P>And the venerable &Acirc;nanda went to the council hall of the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;; and when he had arrived there, he informed them, saying, 'The</P>
<P><A NAME="page_122"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 122</FONT></A></P>
<P>Blessed One, O V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>as, is dead; do, then, whatever seemeth to you fit!'</P>
<P>24. And when they had heard this saying of the venerable &Acirc;nanda, the Mallas, with their young men and their maidens and their wives, were grieved, and sad, and afflicted at heart. And some of them wept, dishevelling their hair, and some stretched forth their arms and wept, and some fell prostrate on the ground, and some reeled to and fro in anguish at the thought: 'Too soon has the Blessed One died! Too soon has the Happy One passed away! Too soon has the Light gone out in the world!'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>25. Then the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; gave orders to their attendants, saying, 'Gather together perfumes and garlands, and all the music in Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;!'</P>
<P>26. And the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; took the perfumes and garlands, and all the musical instruments, and five hundred suits of apparel, and went to the Upavattana, to the S&acirc;la Grove of the Mallas, where the body of the Blessed One lay. There they past the day in paying honour, reverence, respect, and homage to the remains of the Blessed One with dancing, and hymns, and music, and with garlands and perfumes; and in making canopies of their garments, and preparing decoration wreaths to hang thereon[1].</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The dress of the Mallas consisted probably of mere lengths of muslin or cotton cloth; and a suit of apparel consisted of two or, at the outside, of three of these-one to wrap round the loins, one to throw over the shoulders, and one to use as a turban. To make a canopy on occasions of state they would join such pieces together; to make the canopy into a tent they would simply add walls of the same material; and the only decoration, as simple as it {footnote p. 123} is beautiful, would be wreaths of flowers, or single lotuses, hanging from the roof, or stretched along the sides.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_123"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 123</FONT></A></P>
<P>27. Then the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; thought:</P>
<P>'It is much too late to burn the body of the Blessed One to-day. Let us now perform the cremation to-morrow.' And in paying honour, reverence, respect, and homage to the remains of the Blessed One with dancing, and hymns, and music, and with garlands and perfumes; and in making canopies of their garments, and preparing decoration wreaths to hang thereon, they past the second day too, and then the third day, and the fourth, and the fifth, and the sixth day also.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>28. Then on the seventh day the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; thought:</P>
<P>'Let us carry the body of the Blessed One, by the south and outside, to a spot on the south, and outside of the city,--paying it honour, and reverence, and respect, and homage, with dance and song and music, with garlands and perfumes,--and there, to the south of the city, let us perform the cremation ceremony!'</P>
<P>29. And thereupon eight chieftains among the Mallas bathed their heads, and clad themselves in new garments with the intention of bearing the body of the Blessed One. But, behold, they could not lift it up!</P>
<P>30. Then the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; said to the venerable Anuruddha: 'What, Lord, can be the reason, what can be the cause that eight chieftains of the Mallas who have bathed their heads, and clad themselves in new garments with the intention</P>
<P><A NAME="page_124"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 124</FONT></A></P>
<P>of bearing the body of the Blessed One, are unable to lift it up?'</P>
<P>'It is because you, O V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>as, have one purpose, and the spirits have another purpose.'</P>
<P>3 1. 'But what, Lord, is the purpose of the spirits?'</P>
<P>'Your purpose, O V&acirc;setthas, is this, Let us carry the body of the Blessed One, by the south and outside, to a spot on the south, and outside of the city,--paying it honour, and reverence, and respect, and homage, with dance and song and music, with garlands and perfumes,--and there, to the south of the city, let us perform the cremation ceremony. But the purpose of the spirits, V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>as, is this, Let us carry the body of the Blessed One by the north to the north of the city, and entering the city by the north gate, let us bring it through the midst of the city into the midst thereof. And going out again by the eastern gate,--paying honour, and reverence, and respect, and homage to the body of the Blessed One, with heavenly dance, and song, and music, and garlands, and perfumes,--let us carry it to the shrine of the Mallas called Maku<I>t</I>a-bandhana, to the east of the city, and there let us perform the cremation ceremony.'</P>
<P>'Even according to the purpose of the spirits, so, Lord, let it be!'</P>
<P>32. Then immediately all Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; down even to the dust bins and rubbish heaps became strewn knee-deep with Mand&acirc;rava flowers from heaven! and while both the spirits from the skies, and the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; upon earth, paid honour, and reverence, and respect, and homage to the body of the Blessed One, with dance and song and music, with garlands and with perfumes, they carried the</P>

<P>body by the north to the north of the city; and entering the city by the north gate they carried it through the midst of the city into the midst thereof; and going out again by the eastern gate they carried it to the shrine of the Mallas, called Maku<I>t</I>a-bandhana; and there, to the cast of the city, they laid down the body of the Blessed One[1].</P>
<P>33.<SUP>[2]</SUP> Then the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; said to the venerable &Acirc;nanda: 'What should be done, Lord, with the remains of the Tath&acirc;gata?'</P>
<P>'As men treat the remains of a king of kings, so, V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>as, should they treat the remains of a Tath&acirc;gata.'</P>
<P>'And how, Lord, do they treat the remains of a king of kings?'</P>
<P>'They wrap the body of a king of kings, V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>as, in a new cloth. When that is done they wrap it in cotton wool. When that is done they wrap it in a new cloth,--and so on till they have wrapped the body in five hundred successive layers of both kinds. Then they place the body in an oil vessel of iron, and cover that close up with another oil vessel of iron. They then build a funeral pile of all kinds of perfumes, and burn the body of the king of kings. And then at the four cross roads they erect a d&acirc;gaba to the king of kings. This, V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>as, is the way in which they treat the remains of a king of kings.</P>
<P>'And as they treat the remains of a king of kings, so, V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>as, should they treat the remains of the</P>

<P>Tath&acirc;gata. At the four cross roads a d&acirc;gaba should be erected to the Tath&acirc;gata. And whosoever shall there place garlands or perfumes or paint, or make salutation there, or become in its presence calm in heart-that shall long be to them for a profit and a joy.'</P>
<P>34. Therefore the Mallas gave orders to their attendants, saying, 'Gather together all the carded cotton wool of the Mallas!'</P>
<P>35. Then the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; wrapped the body of the Blessed One in a new cloth. And when that was done, they wrapped it in cotton wool. And when that was done, they wrapped it in a new cloth,--and so on till they had wrapped the body of the Blessed One in five hundred layers of both kinds. And then they placed the body in an oil vessel of iron, and covered that close up with another oil vessel of iron. And then they built a funeral pile of all kinds of perfumes, and upon it they placed the body of the Blessed One.</P>
<P>36. Now at that time the venerable Mah&acirc; Kassapa was journeying along the high road from P&acirc;v&acirc; to Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; with a great company of the brethren, with about five hundred of the brethren. And the venerable Mah&acirc; Kassapa left the high road, and sat himself down at the foot of a certain tree.</P>
<P>37. Just at that time a certain naked ascetic who had picked up a Mand&acirc;rava flower in Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; was coming along the high road to P&acirc;v&acirc;.</P>
<P>38. And the venerable Mah&acirc; Kassapa saw the naked ascetic coming in the distance; and when he had seen him he said to the naked ascetic:</P>

And immediately of those of the brethren who were not yet free from the passions, some stretched out their arms and wept, and some fell headlong on the ground, and some reeled to and fro in anguish at the thought: 'Too soon has the Blessed One died! Too soon has the Happy One passed away from existence! Too soon has the Light gone out in the world!'</P>
<P>But those of the brethren who were free from the passions (the Arahats) bore their grief collected and composed at the thought: 'Impermanent are all component things! How is it possible that they should not be dissolved?'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>40. Now at that time a brother named Subhadda, who had been received into the order in his old age, was seated there in their company[1].</P>
<P>And Subhadda the old addressed the brethren, and said: 'Enough, brethren! Weep not, neither lament! We are well rid of the great Sama<I>n</I>a. We used to be annoyed by being told, "This beseems you, this beseems you not." But now we shall be able to do whatever we like; and what we do not like, that we shall not have to do!'</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. At p. xxvi of the Introduction to his edition of the Mah&acirc; Vagga, Dr. Oldenberg identifies this Subhadda with Subhadda the last convert, mentioned above in Chap. V, §§ 52-68. They are different persons; the last convert being represented as a young man of high character, incapable of the conduct here ascribed to this Subhadda. The last convert was a Br&acirc;hman, traditionally supposed to be younger brother to A<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>a Konda<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>a, the first convert; this Subhadda had been a barber in the village &Acirc;tum&acirc;.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_128"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 128</FONT></A></P>
<P>41. But the venerable Mah&acirc; Kassapa addressed the brethren, and said: 'Enough, my brethren! Weep not, neither lament! Has not the Blessed One formerly declared this to us, that it is in the very nature of all things, near and dear unto us, that we must divide ourselves from them, leave them, sever ourselves from them? How then, brethren, can this be possible--that whereas anything whatever born, brought into being, and organised contains within itself the inherent necessity of dissolution--how then can this be possible that such a being should not be dissolved? No such condition can exist!'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>42. Now just at that time four chieftains of the Mallas had bathed their heads and clad themselves in new garments with the intention of setting on fire the funeral pile of the Blessed One. But, behold, they were unable to set it alight!</P>
<P>43. Then the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; said to the venerable Anuruddha: 'What, Lord, can be the reason, and what the cause, that four chieftains of the Mallas who have bathed their heads, and clad themselves in new garments, with the intention of setting on fire the funeral pile of the Blessed One, are unable to set it on fire?'</P>
<P>'It is because you, O V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>as, have one purpose, and the spirits have another purpose.'</P>
<P>44. 'But what, Lord, is the purpose of the spirits?'</P>
<P>'The purpose of the spirits, O V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>as, is this: That venerable brother Mah&acirc; Kassapa is now journeying along the high road from P&acirc;v&acirc; to Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; with a great company of the brethren, with five hundred of the brethren. The funeral pile of</P>
<P><A NAME="page_129"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 129</FONT></A></P>
<P>the Blessed One shall not catch fire, until the venerable Mah&acirc; Kassapa shall have been able reverently to salute the sacred feet of the Blessed One.'</P>
<P>'Even according to the purpose of the spirits, so, Lord, let it be!'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>45. Then the venerable Mah&acirc; Kassapa went on to Maku<I>t</I>a-bandhana of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;, to the shrine of the Mallas, to the place where the funeral pile of the Blessed One was. And when he had come up to it, he arranged his robe on one shoulder; and bowing down with clasped hands he thrice walked reverently round the pile; and then, uncovering the feet, he bowed down in reverence at the feet of the Blessed One.</P>
<P>46. And those five hundred brethren arranged their robes on one shoulder; and bowing down with clasped hands, they thrice walked reverently round the pile, and then bowed down in reverence at the feet of the Blessed One.</P>
<P>47. And when the homage of the venerable Mah&acirc; Kassapa and of those five hundred brethren was ended, the funeral pile of the Blessed One caught fire of itself[1].</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. It is possible that we have here the survival of some ancient custom. Spence Hardy appropriately refers to a ceremony among Jews (of what place or time is not mentioned) in the following terms: 'Just before a Jew is taken out of the house to be buried, the relatives and acquaintances of the departed stand round the coffin; when the feet are uncovered; and each in rotation lays hold of the great toes, and begs pardon for any offence given to the deceased, and requests a favourable mention of them in the next world.' (Manual of Buddhism, p. 348).</P>
<P>The Buddhist bhikkhus in Siam and the great majority of those in Ceylon (the adherents of the Siyam-sam&acirc;gama) always keep one shoulder uncovered. It is evident that the bhikkhus {footnote p. 130} in Burma, and those in Ceylon who belong to the Amara-pura-sam&acirc;gama, are more in accordance with ancient custom in wearing the robe ordinarily over both shoulders.]</P>

<P>48. Now as the body of the Blessed One burned itself away, from the skin and the integument, and the flesh, and the nerves, and the fluid of the joints, neither soot nor ash was seen: and only the bones remained behind.</P>
<P>Just as one sees no soot or ash when glue or oil is burned; so, as the body of the Blessed One burned itself away, from the skin and the integument, and the flesh, and the nerves, and the fluid of the joints, neither soot nor ash was seen: and only the bones remained behind. And of those five hundred pieces of raiment the very innermost and outermost were both consumed.</P>
<P>49. And when the body of the Blessed One had been burnt up, there came down streams of water from the sky and extinguished the funeral pile of the Blessed One; and there burst forth streams of water from the storehouse of the waters (beneath the earth), and extinguished the funeral pile of the Blessed One. The Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; also brought water scented with all kinds of perfumes, and extinguished the funeral pile of the Blessed One[1].</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. There is something very quaint in the way in which the faithful Mallas are here represented as bringing coals to Newcastle. The 'storehouse of the waters' is in P&acirc;li udaka-s&acirc;la, on which Buddhaghosa has two theories: first, that the S&acirc;la trees around shed down a miraculous rain from their trunks and branches and leaves; and next, that the waters burst up from the earth and became as it were a diadem of crystal round the pyre. On the belief that water thus burst up miraculously through the earth, see 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' pp. 64, 67. If the reading be correct it is scarcely possible that s&acirc;la can here have anything to do with S&acirc;la trees; but the other interpretation is open to the objections {footnote p. 131} that s&acirc;la means an open hall rather than a storehouse, and that the belief in a 'storehouse of water' has not, as yet, been found elsewhere.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_131"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 131</FONT></A></P>
<P>50. Then the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; surrounded the bones of the Blessed One in their council hall with a lattice work of spears, and with a rampart of bows; and there for seven days they paid honour and reverence and respect and homage to them with dance and song and music, and with garlands and perfumes.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>51. Now the king of Magadha, A<I>g</I>&acirc;tasattu, the son of the queen of the Videha clan, heard the news that the Blessed One had died at Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;.</P>
<P>Then the king of Magadha, A<I>g</I>&acirc;tasattu, the son of the queen of the Videha clan, sent a messenger to the Mallas, saying, 'The Blessed One belonged to the soldier caste, and I too am of the soldier caste. I am worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One. Over the remains of the Blessed One will I put up a sacred cairn, and in their honour will I celebrate a feast[1]!'</P>
<P>52. And the Li<I>kkh</I>avis of Ves&acirc;li heard the news that the Blessed One had died at Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;. And the Li<I>kkh</I>avis of Ves&acirc;li sent a messenger to the Mallas, saying, 'The Blessed One belonged to the soldier caste, and we too are of the soldier caste. We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One. Over the remains of the Blessed One will we put up a sacred cairn, and in their honour will we celebrate a feast!'</P>

</FONT><P><A NAME="page_132"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 132</FONT></A></P>
<P>news that the Blessed One had died at Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;. And the S&acirc;kiyas of Kapila-vatthu sent a messenger to the Mallas, saying, 'The Blessed One was the pride of our race. We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One. Over the remains of the Blessed One will we put up a sacred cairn, and in their honour will we celebrate a feast!'</P>
<P>54. And the Bulis of Allakappa heard the news that the Blessed One had died at Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;. And the Bulis of Allakappa sent a messenger to the Mallas, saying, 'The Blessed One belonged to the soldier caste, and we too are of the soldier caste. We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One. Over the remains of the Blessed One will we put up a sacred cairn, and in their honour will we celebrate a feast!'</P>
<P>55. And the Koliyas of R&acirc;mag&acirc;ma heard the news that the Blessed One had died at Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;. And the Koliyas of R&acirc;mag&acirc;ma sent a messenger to the Mallas, saying, 'The Blessed One belonged to the soldier caste, and we too are of the soldier caste. We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One. Over the remains of the Blessed One will we put up a sacred cairn, and in their honour will we celebrate a feast!'</P>
<P>56. And the Br&acirc;hman of Ve<I>th</I>ad&icirc;pa heard the news that the Blessed One had died at Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;. And the Br&acirc;hman of Ve<I>th</I>ad&icirc;pa sent a messenger to the Mallas, saying, 'The Blessed One belonged to the soldier caste, and I am a Br&acirc;hman. I am worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One. Over the remains of the Blessed One will I put up a sacred cairn, and in their honour will I celebrate a feast!'</P>
<P><A NAME="page_133"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 133</FONT></A></P>
<P>57. And the Mallas of P&acirc;v&acirc; heard the news that the Blessed One had died at Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;.</P>
<P>Then the Mallas of P&acirc;v&acirc; sent a messenger to the Mallas, saying, 'The Blessed One belonged to the soldier caste, and we too are of the soldier caste. We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One. Over the remains of the Blessed One will we put up a sacred cairn, and in their honour will we celebrate a feast!'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>58. When they heard these things the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; spoke to the assembled brethren, saying, 'The Blessed One died in our village domain. We will not give away any part of the remains of the Blessed One!'</P>
<P>59. When they had thus spoken, Do<I>n</I>a the Br&acirc;hman addressed the assembled brethren, and said:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'Hear, reverend sirs, one single word from me.<BR>
Forbearance was our Buddha wont to teach.<BR>
Unseemly is it that over the division<BR>
Of the remains of him who was the best of beings<BR>
Strife should arise, and wounds, and war!<BR>
Let us all, sirs, with one accord unite<BR>
In friendly harmony to make eight portions.<BR>
Wide spread let Th&ucirc;pas rise in every land<BR>
That in the Enlightened One mankind may trust!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>60. 'Do thou then, O Br&acirc;hman, thyself divide the remains of the Blessed One equally into eight parts, with fair division[1].'</P>
<P>Be it so, sir!' said Do<I>n</I>a, in assent, to the assembled</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Here again the commentator expands and adds to the comparatively simple version of the text.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_134"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 134</FONT></A></P>
<P>brethren. And he divided the remains of the Blessed One equally into eight parts, with fair division. And he said to them: 'Give me, sirs, this vessel, and I will set up over it a sacred cairn, and in its honour will I establish a feast.'</P>
<P>And they gave the vessel to Do<I>n</I>a the Br&acirc;hman.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>61. And the Moriyas of Pipphalivana heard the news that the Blessed One had died at Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;.</P>
<P>Then the Moriyas of Pipphalivana sent a messenger to the Mallas, saying, 'The Blessed One belonged to the soldier caste, and we too are of the soldier caste. We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One. Over the remains of the Blessed One will we put up a sacred cairn, and in their honour will we celebrate a feast!'</P>
<P>And when they heard the answer, saying, 'There is no portion of the remains of the Blessed One left over. The remains of the Blessed One are all distributed,' then they took away the embers.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>62. Then the king of Magadha, A<I>g</I>&acirc;tasattu, the son of the queen of the Videha clan, made a mound in R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha over the remains of the Blessed One, and held a feast.</P>
<P>And the Li<I>kkh</I>avis of Ves&acirc;li made a mound in Ves&acirc;li over the remains of the Blessed One, and held a feast.</P>
<P>And the Bulis of Allakappa made a mound in Allakappa over the remains of the Blessed One, and held a feast.</P>
<P>And the Koliyas of R&acirc;mag&acirc;ma made a mound in R&acirc;mag&acirc;ma over the remains of the Blessed One, and held a feast.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_135"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 135</FONT></A></P>
<P>And Ve<I>th</I>ad&icirc;paka the Br&acirc;hman made a mound in Ve<I>th</I>ad&icirc;pa over the remains of the Blessed One, and held a feast.</P>
<P>And the Mallas of P&acirc;v&acirc; made a mound in P&acirc;v&acirc; over the remains of the Blessed One, and held a feast.</P>
<P>And the Mallas of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; made a mound in Kusin&acirc;r&acirc; over the remains of the Blessed One, and held a feast.</P>
<P>And Do<I>n</I>a the Br&acirc;hman made a mound over the vessel in which the body had been burnt, and held a feast.</P>
<P>And the Moriyas of Pipphalivana made a mound over the embers, and held a feast.</P>
<P>Thus were there eight mounds [Th&ucirc;pas] for the remains, and one for the vessel, and one for the embers. This was how it used to be[1].</P>
