§ 42. GOOD AND BAD KARMA.

<span class="small">Translated from the Samyutta-Nikâya
(iii.2.10<sup>1</sup>).</span>

   Thus have I heard.

   On a certain occasion The Blessed One was dwelling at Sâvatthi, in
Jetavana monastery in Anâthapindika's Park. Then drew near king Pasenadi
the Kosalan, at an unusual time of day, to where The Blessed One was;
and having drawn near and greeted The Blessed One, he sat down
respectfully at one side. And king Pasenadi the Kosalan being seated
respectfully at one side, The Blessed One spoke to him as follows:

   "Pray, whence have you come, great king, at this unusual time of
day?"

   "Reverend Sir, a householder who was treasurer in Sâvatthi has just
died leaving no son, and I have come from transferring his property to
my royal palace; and, Reverend

|                                   |                                                     |

Sir, he had ten million pieces of gold, and silver beyond all reckoning.
But this householder, Reverend Sir, would eat sour gruel and kanâjaka,
and the clothes he wore were made of hemp . . ., and the conveyance in
which he rode was a broken-down chariot with an umbrella of leaves."

   "Even so, great king! Even so, great king! Formerly, great king, that
householder and treasurer gave food in alms to a Private Buddha named
Tagarasikkhi. But after he had given the order, saying, 'Give food to
this monk,' and had risen from his seat and departed, he repented him of
the gift and said to himself, 'It would have been better if my slaves or
my servants had had this food.' And, moreover, he murdered his brother's
only son for the sake of the inheritance. Now whereas, great king, that
householder and treasurer gave food in alms to the Private Buddha
Tagarasikkhi, as the fruit of this deed he was born seven times in a
higher state of existence, into a heavenly world; and as a further
result of this deed he has held the treasurership seven times here in
Sâvatthi. And whereas, great king, that householder and treasurer
repented him of the gift, and said to himself, 'It would have been
better if my slaves or my servants had had this food,' as the result of
this sinful thought his mind has been averse to sumptuous food, to
sumptuous clothing, to sumptuous equipages, to a sumptuous gratification
of the five senses. And whereas, great king, the treasurer murdered his
brother's only son for the sake of the inheritance, as a result of this
deed he has suffered in hell for many years, for many hundreds of years,
for many thousands of years, for many hundreds of thousands of years;
and as a further result of this deed he has now for the seventh time
died without leaving any son and forfeited his property into the royal
treasury. But now, great king, the former merit of this treasurer has
become exhausted, and no new merit has been accumulated, and at the
present time, great king, the treasurer is suffering in the Mahâ-Roruva
hell."

   "Reverend Sir, has the treasurer been reborn in the Mahâ-Roruva
hell?"

   "Yes, great king. The treasurer has been reborn in the Mahâ-Roruva
hell."
