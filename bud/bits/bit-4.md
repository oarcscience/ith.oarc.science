THE THREE CHARACTERISTICS.

<span class="small">Translated from the Anguttara-Nikâya
(iii.134<sup>1</sup>).</span>

Whether Buddhas arise, O priests, or whether Buddhas do not arise, it
remains a fact and the fixed and necessary constitution of being, that
all its constituents are transitory. This fact a Buddha discovers and
masters, and when he has discovered and mastered it, he announces,
teaches, publishes, proclaims, discloses, minutely explains, and makes
it clear, that all the constituents of being are transitory.

Whether Buddhas arise, O priests, or whether Buddhas do not arise, it
remains a fact and the fixed and necessary constitution of being, that
all its constituents are misery. This fact a Buddha discovers and
masters, and when he has discovered and mastered it, he announces,
teaches, publishes, proclaims, discloses, minutely explains, and makes
it clear, that all the constituents of being are misery.

Whether Buddhas arise, O priests, or whether Buddhas do not arise, it
remains a fact and the fixed and necessary constitution of being, that
all its elements are lacking in an Ego. This fact a Buddha discovers and
masters, and when he has discovered and mastered it, he announces,
teaches, publishes, proclaims, discloses, minutely explains, and makes
it clear, that all the elements of being are lacking in an Ego.
