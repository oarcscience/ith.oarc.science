CHAPTER V.

THE ORDER.

<span class="small">INTRODUCTORY DISCOURSE.</span>

   U<span class="small">NLIKE</span> Christ, The Buddha instituted an
Order, or Church, during his own lifetime; and in the course of his long
ministry of forty-five years, and as occasion arose, he made a great
many regulations for its guidance. To give these rules and ordinances at
length would be a large undertaking, and make this book too technical.
The desultory selections of this chapter are therefore mainly
illustrative in character, and designed to show what the Buddhists
understand by the monastic life, and the duties and position of the
laity. It is curious that the aversion which The Buddha showed to having
women as members of the Order appears to have been shared by the
Buddhist Church in the ages subsequent to his death. The nuns seem never
to have played an influential rôle in the history of Buddhism, and there
are now no nuns in Ceylon.
