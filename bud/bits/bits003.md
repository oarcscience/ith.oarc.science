§ 3. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A FUTURE BUDDHA.

<span class="small">Translated from the Introduction to the Jâtaka

These eight conditions were all united in him when he made his earnest
wish at the feet of Dîpamkara, saying,--

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">

Thereupon, putting forth a strenuous effort,--as it is said,--

<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">

he discovered, not only the perfection which is called alms, but also
all the others that go to make a Buddha. And in fulfilling them he
reached his Vessantara existence.<span

blessings celebrated in the following stanzas as belonging to Future
Buddhas who make the earnest wish were attained by him:--

|                                 |                                                  |

| <span id="page_35">p. 35</span> | <span class="small">\[J.i.45<sup>11</sup></span> |

   Now in accomplishing these Ten Perfections there was no limit to the
number of existences in which he fulfilled the perfection of almsgiving;
as when he was born as the Brahman Akitti, the Brahman Samkha, king
Dhanañjaya, Mahâ-Sudassana, Mahâ-Govinda, king Nimi, prince Canda,
Visayha the treasurer, king Sivi, and king Vessantara. But the acme was
reached when as the Wise Hare<span id="page_35_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_35_note_1.md) he said,--

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">

<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">

<td>"There came a beggar, asked for food;<br />
Myself I gave that he might eat.<br />
In alms there's none can equal me;<br />
In alms have I perfection reached."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Thus, in this offering up of his own life, he acquired the perfection of
almsgiving in its highest degree.

   Likewise there was no limit to the number of existences in which he
fulfilled the precepts; as when he was born as the elephant-king Sîlava,
the snake-king Campeyya, the snake-king Bhûridatta, the elephant-king
Chaddanta, and prince Alînasattu, son of king Jayaddisa. But the acme
was reached when, as related in the Samkhapâla Birth-Story, he said,--

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">

<td>"They pierced me through with pointed stakes,<br />
They hacked me with their hunting-knives;<br />
Yet gainst these Bhojans raged I not,<br />
But kept the precepts perfectly."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Thus, in giving up his own life, he acquired perfection in the keeping
of the precepts.

   Likewise there was no limit to the number of existences in which he
fulfilled the perfection of abnegation by abandoning

|                                 |                                                  |

| <span id="page_36">p. 36</span> | <span class="small">\[J.i.45<sup>28</sup></span> |

his throne; as when he was born as prince Somanassa, prince Hatthipâla,
and the pandit Ayoghara. But the acme was reached when, as related in
the Lesser Sutasoma Birth-Story, he said,--

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>261.</td>
<td>"A kingdom dropped into my hands;<br />
Like spittle vile I let it fall,<br />
Nor for it felt the smallest wish,<br />
And thus renunciation gained."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Thus, free from attachment, he renounced a kingdom and retired from the
world, and by so doing acquired the perfection of abnegation in its
highest degree.

   Likewise there was no limit to the number of existences in which he
fulfilled the perfection of knowledge; as when he was born as the pandit
Vidhûra, the pandit Mahâ-Govinda, the pandit Kuddâla, the pandit Araka,
the wandering ascetic Bodhi, and the pandit Mahosadha. But the acme was
reached when, as the pandit Senaka of the Sattubhatta Birth-Story, he
said,--

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>262.</td>
<td>"With wisdom sifted I the case,<br />
And freed the Brahman from his woe;<br />
In wisdom none can equal me:<br />
In wisdom I've perfection reached,"<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

and displayed to all present the serpent which lay concealed in the bag,
and in so doing acquired the perfection of wisdom in its highest degree.

   Likewise there was no limit to the number of existences in which he
fulfilled the perfection of courage. But the acme was reached when, as
related in the Greater Janaka Birth-Story, he said,--

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>263.</td>
<td>"Far out of sight of land were we,<br />
The crew were all as dead of fright;<br />
Yet still unruffled was my mind:<br />
In courage I've perfection reached."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Thus it was in crossing the ocean he acquired the perfection of courage
in its highest degree.

|                                 |                                                  |
|:--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_37">p. 37</span> | <span class="small">\[J.i.46<sup>17</sup></span> |

   Likewise in the Khantivâda Birth-Story, where he said,--

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>264.</td>
<td>"Like one insensible I lay,<br />
While with his hatchet keen he hacked,<br />
Nor raged I gainst Benares' king:<br />
In patience I've perfection reached,"<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

in enduring great suffering, while appearing to be unconscious, he
acquired the perfection of patience in its highest degree.

   Likewise in the Greater Sutasoma Birth-Story, where he said,--

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>265.</td>
<td>"I kept the promise I had made,<br />
And gave my life in sacrifice,<br />
A hundred warriors set I free:<br />
In truth have I perfection reached,"<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

in keeping his word at the sacrifice of his life, he acquired the
perfection of truth in its highest degree.

   Likewise in the Mûgapakkha Birth-Story, where he said,--

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>266.</td>
<td>"'T is not that I my parents hate,<br />
'T is not that glory I detest,<br />
But since omniscience I held dear,<br />
Therefore I kept my firm resolve,"<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

in resolving on a course of conduct that cost him his life, he acquired
the perfection of resolution in its highest degree.

   Likewise in the Ekarâja Birth-Story, where he said,--

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>267.</td>
<td>"No fear has any one of me,<br />
Nor have I fear of any one,<br />
In my good-will to all I trust,<br />
And love to dwell in lonely woods,"<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

in the exercise of feelings of good-will, and in taking no thought for
his life, he acquired the perfection of good-will in its highest degree.

   Likewise in the Lomahamsa Birth-Story, where he said,--

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>268.</td>
<td>"I laid me down among the dead,<br />
A pillow of their bones I made;<br />
While from the villages around,<br />
Some came to mock, and some to praise,"<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

|                                 |                                                 |
|:--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_38">p. 38</span> | <span class="small">\[J.i.47<sup>9</sup></span> |

while village children flocked about him, and some spat and others
showered fragrant garlands upon him, he was indifferent alike to
pleasure and pain, and acquired the perfection of indifference in its
highest degree.

   The above is an abridgment, but the full account is given in the
Cariyâ-Pitaka.

   Having thus fulfilled all the perfections, he said, in his existence
as Vessantara,--

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>269.</td>
<td>"This earth, unconscious though she be,<br />
And ignorant of joy or grief,<br />
E'en she then felt alms' mighty power,<br />
And shook and quaked full seven times."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

And having thus caused the earth to quake by his mighty deeds of merit,
at the end of that existence he died, and was reborn in the Tusita
heaven.

   Accordingly the period from the time when he fell at the feet of
Dîpamkara to his birth in the city of the Tusita gods constitutes the
Distant Epoch.

<span id="page_35_note_1"></span>[1](#page_35_fr_1.md) The story of the
Future Buddha's existence as the Wise Hare is given further on under the
caption, ["The Hare-Mark in the Moon."](bits056.md) It is the only one of
the numerous Birth-Stories above-mentioned that is to be found in this
book. The stanza quoted, however, is not taken from that account, but
from another work called the Cariyâ-Pitaka, which is wholly in poetry.
The Cariyâ-Pitaka consists of Birth-Stories, and besides the Wise Hare,
gives several others of those here mentioned. Some are also briefly
alluded to in the ninth chapter of the Visuddhi-Magga; but of course the
great treasure-house for Birth-Stories is the Jâtaka itself.
