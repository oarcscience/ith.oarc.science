§ 67. GOING FURTHER AND FARING WORSE.

\[THE FIRST HIGH POWER.\]

<span class="small">Translated from the Kevaddha-Sutta of the
Digha-Nikâya (xi.67).</span>

   Once upon a time, O Kevaddha, a reflection occurred to a certain
priest of this very congregation: "Where do these four elements, to wit,
the earthy element, the watery element, the fiery element, and the windy
element, utterly cease?" Then, O Kevaddha, the priest entered upon a
state of trance of such a nature that, his thoughts being in this state
of trance, the way to the gods became revealed to him. Then, O Kevaddha,
the priest drew near to where the Gods of the Suite of the Four Great
Kings were; and having drawn near, he spoke to the Gods of the Suite of
the Four Great Kings as follows:

   "My friends, where do these four elements, to wit, the earthy
element, the watery element, the fiery element, and the windy element,
utterly cease?"

   When he had thus spoken, O Kevaddha, the Gods of the Suite of the
Four Great Kings spoke to the priest as follows:

   "We, O priest, do not know where these four elements, to wit, the
earthy element, the watery element, the fiery element, and the windy
element, utterly cease. However, O priest, there are the Four Great
Kings, who are more glorious and more excellent than we, they would know
where these four elements, to wit, the earthy element, the watery
element, the fiery element, and the windy element, utterly cease."

   Then, O Kevaddha, the priest drew near to where the Four Great Kings
were; and having drawn near, he spoke to the Four Great Kings as
follows:

   "My friends, where do these four elements, to wit, the earthy
element, the watery element, the fiery element, and the windy element,
utterly cease?"

|                                   |                                      |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_309">p. 309</span> | <span class="small">\[D.xi.69</span> |

   When he had thus spoken, O Kevaddha, the Four Great Kings spoke to
the priest as follows:

   "We, O priest, do not know where these four elements, to wit, the
earthy element, the watery element, the fiery element, and the windy
element, utterly cease. However, O priest, there are the Gods of the
Suite of the Thirty-three, who are more glorious and more excellent than
we, they would know where these four elements, to wit, the earthy
element, the watery element, the fiery element, and the windy element,
utterly cease."

   \[The priest then made a visit to the Gods of the Suite of the
Thirty-three, and to their ruler, Sakka; to the Yama gods, and to their
ruler, Suyâma; to the Satisfied Gods, and to their ruler, the Satisfied
One; to the Gods Who Delight in Fashioning, and to their ruler, the
Well-fashioned One; to the Gods Who Have Control of Pleasures Fashioned
by Others, and to their ruler, the Controller; in each case putting the
same question, and being directed to apply further on. The Controller's
speech was as follows:\]

   "I, O priest, do not know where these four elements, to wit, the
earthy. element, the watery element, the fiery element, and the windy
element, utterly cease. However, O priest, there are the Gods of the
Retinue of Brahma, who are more glorious and more excellent than I, they
would know where these four elements, to wit, the earthy element, the
watery element, the fiery element, and the windy element, utterly
cease."

   Then, O Kevaddha, the priest entered upon a state of trance of such a
nature that, his thoughts being in this state of trance, the way to the
Brahma-world became revealed to him. Then, O Kevaddha, the priest drew
near to where the Gods of the Retinue of Brahma were; and having drawn
near, he spoke to the Gods of the Retinue of Brahma as follows:

   "My friends, where do these four elements, to wit, the earthy
element, the watery element, the fiery element, and the windy element,
utterly cease?"

   When he had thus spoken, O Kevaddha, the Gods of the Retinue of
Brahma spoke to the priest as follows:

|                                   |                                      |

   "We, O priest, do not know where these four elements, to wit, the
earthy element, the watery element, the fiery element, and the windy
element, utterly cease. However, O priest, there is Brahma, Great
Brahma, the Supreme Being, the Unsurpassed, the Perceiver of All Things,
the Controller, the Lord of All, the Maker, the Fashioner, the Chief,
the Victor, the Ruler, the Father of All Beings Who Have Been and Are to
Be, who is more glorious and more excellent than we, he would know where
these four elements, to wit, the earthy element, the watery element, the
fiery element, and the windy element, utterly cease."

   "But where, my friends, is Great Brahma at the present moment?"

   "We do not know, O priest, where Brahma is, or in what direction
Brahma is, or whereabouts Brahma is. But inasmuch, O priest, as signs
are seen, and a radiance is noticed, and an effulgence appears, Brahma
himself will appear. This is a previous sign of the appearing of Brahma,
to wit, that a radiance is noticed, and an effulgence appears."

   Then, O Kevaddha, in no long time, Brahma appeared. Then, O Kevaddha,
the priest drew near to where Brahma was; and having drawn near, he
spoke to Brahma as follows:

   "My friend, where do these four elements, to wit, the earthy element,
the watery element, the fiery element, and the windy element, utterly
cease?"

   When he had thus spoken, O Kevaddha, Great Brahma spoke to the priest
as follows:

   "I, O priest, am Brahma, Great Brahma, the Supreme Being, the
Unsurpassed, the Perceiver of All Things, the Controller, the Lord of
All, the Maker, the Fashioner, the Chief, the Victor, the Ruler, the
Father of All Beings Who Have Been and Are to Be."

   And a second time, O Kevaddha, the priest spoke to Brahma as follows:

   "My friend, I am not asking you, 'Are you Brahma, Great Brahma, the
Supreme Being, the Unsurpassed, the Perceiver of All Things, the
Controller, the Lord of All, the Maker, the Fashioner, the Chief, the
Victor, the Ruler,

|                                   |                                      |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_311">p. 311</span> | <span class="small">\[D.xi.82</span> |

the Father of All Beings Who Have Been and Are to Be?' But this, my
friend, is what I ask you, 'Where do these four elements, to wit, the
earthy element, the watery element, the fiery element, and the windy
element, utterly cease?'"

   And a second time, O Kevaddha, Great Brahma spoke to the priest as
follows:

   "I, O priest, am Brahma, Great Brahma, the Supreme Being, the
Unsurpassed, the Perceiver of All Things, the Controller, the Lord of
All, the Maker, the Fashioner, the Chief, the Victor, the Ruler, the
Father of All Beings Who Have Been and Are to Be."

   And a third time, O Kevaddha, the priest spoke to Brahma as follows:

   "My friend, I am not asking you, 'Are you Brahma, Great Brahma, the
Supreme Being, the Unsurpassed, the Perceiver of All Things, the
Controller, the Lord of All, the Maker, the Fashioner, the Chief, the
Victor, the Ruler, the Father of All Beings Who Have Been and Are to
Be?' But this, my friend, is what I ask you, 'Where do these four
elements, to wit, the earthy element, the watery element, the fiery
element, and the windy element, utterly cease?'"

   Then, O Kevaddha, Great Brahma took the priest by the arm, and led
him to one side, and spoke to the priest as follows:

   "O priest, these gods of my suite believe as follows: 'Brahma sees
all things; knows all things; has penetrated all things.' Therefore was
it that I did not answer you in their presence. I, O priest, do not know
where these four elements, to wit, the earthy element, the watery
element, the fiery element, and the windy element, utterly cease.
Therefore it was a sin and a crime, O priest, that you left The Blessed
One, and went elsewhere in quest of an answer to this question. Turn
back, O priest, and having drawn near to The Blessed One, ask him this
question, and as The Blessed One shall explain unto you, so believe."

   Then, O Kevaddha, the priest, as quickly as a strong man might
stretch out his bent arm, or might draw in his stretched-out arm,
disappeared from that Brahma-heaven, and appeared

|                                   |                                      |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_312">p. 312</span> | <span class="small">\[D.xi.84</span> |

in front of me. Then, O Kevaddha, when the priest had greeted me, he sat
down respectfully at one side; and seated respectfully at one Bide, the
priest, O Kevaddha, spoke to me as follows:

   "Reverend Sir, where do these four elements, to wit, the earthy
element, the watery element, the fiery element, and the windy element,
utterly cease?"

   "When he had thus spoken, O Kevaddha, I spoke to the priest as
follows:

   "Once upon a time, O priest, some seafaring traders, having a
land-sighting bird, sailed out into the sea with their ship; and when
the ship was out of sight of land, they set free that land-sighting
bird. Such a bird flies in an easterly direction, in a southerly
direction, in a westerly direction, in a northerly direction, towards
the zenith, and to the intermediate quarters; and, if it sees land
anywhere about, it flies thither, but if it does not see land anywhere
about, it returns to the ship. In exactly the same way, O priest, when
you had searched as far as to the Brahma-world, and had found no answer
to this question, you returned to me. O priest, this question ought
never to have been put thus, 'Reverend Sir, where do these four
elements, to wit, the earthy element, the watery element, the fiery
element, and the windy element, utterly cease?' But this, O priest, is
how the question should have been put,

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"O where doth water, where doth earth,<br />
And fire, and wind no footing find?<br />
And where doth long, and where doth short,<br />
And fine and coarse and good and bad,<br />
And where do name and form both cease,<br />
And turn to utter nothingness?<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   "And the answer is,

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"In consciousness invisible<br />
And infinite, of radiance bright,<br />
O there doth water, there doth earth,<br />
And fire and wind no footing find.<br />
And there doth long, and there doth short,<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

|                                   |                                      |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_313">p. 313</span> | <span class="small">\[D.xi.85</span> |

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">

</colgroup>

<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">

And there do name and form both cease,<br />
And utter nothingness become.<br />
And then, when consciousness hath ceased,<br />
This all hath turned to nothingness."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   Thus spake The Blessed One, and the delighted householder, Kevaddha,
applauded the speech of The Blessed One.
