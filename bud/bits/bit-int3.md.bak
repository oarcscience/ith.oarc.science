CHAPTER III.

KARMA AND REBIRTH.

<span class="small">INTRODUCTORY DISCOURSE.</span>

   P<span class="small">ERHAPS</span> one of the hardest of the Buddhist
doctrines is that of Karma. It is a doctrine, not only hard in itself,
but it seems to contradict their other tenets. The Buddhists, as we have
seen, resolve the human being into a number of elements called *dhammas*
which possess no permanent existence, and they say that on account of
this transitoriness no one of these can be considered as the individual,
the Ego, the "self." There is therefore here nothing to be
reborn--nothing to transmigrate. How then is it, that when he has thus
denied all substantive existence to everything which to the Occidental
thinker appears to possess the greatest reality, the Oriental should
attribute to karma this faculty of being reborn indefinitely?

   The word *karma* means 'deeds,' or, as it is often used in the
singular, it might perhaps be translated by 'performance' or 'action.'
How can substantive reality be attributed to a mere conception of the
mind like that of deed or performance, when it is denied of all those
components of the human being of which we are cognizant by means of our
senses and our self-consciousness? How can any deed be said to be
immortal, except in a purely figurative sense, meaning that the memory
or else the objective effect of it persists? Now if we look at this
doctrine of Karma a little more closely, we may see that it is not so
very unlike Christian ideas. If we were to translate <span
id="page_210">p. 210</span> the word *karma* somewhat freely, we might
call it 'character.' And what, indeed, do we ordinarily mean when we
speak of personal immortality, unless it be that the characters of our
friends are reborn in heaven? It is evidently not the body that is
reborn, for that is left behind with us. And what do we know of the
spirit except simply its manifestations, and what we may argue from our
own self-consciousness? Our knowledge of our friend is composed of what
our senses tell us of his body and what we observe of his deeds. It is
his character, his particular set of deeds, or karma, that we think of
as surviving death; and this is exactly what the Buddhists do,--the only
difference being that we claim the existence of an Ego. This we claim to
know by self-inspection; and therefore, when we speak metaphysically, we
say that it is our friend's Ego, or soul, that is reborn, and that our
friend's character, which is really all we directly know of our friend,
is simply the manifestation of that Ego. But as the Buddhists deny the
existence of any soul, it is only observed character, or karma, that is
left to be reborn. The reader will see, I think, that the two doctrines
are really very similar, if we but leave the postulation of an Ego out
of the question.

   But the question still remains: How can character that is no entity
in itself be reborn? Now here it is to be noted that the word 'karma'
covers two distinct ideas; namely, the deed itself, and the effects of
that deed in modifying the subsequent character and fortunes of the
doer. The Buddhists say that this subjective effect continues after
death into the next life. The following illustration may tend to make
the general idea of the perpetuation of character without identity of
substance seem more reasonable. Why cannot a swallow's egg hatch out a
lark? or a lark's a swallow? Is there any difference perceptible between
the two eggs in respect of composition or structure, adequate to account
for the difference in the <span id="page_211">p. 211</span> result? If
not, how is it that the egg of the lark will never hatch out into any
other kind of a bird than a lark, and that a swallow's egg must always
yield a swallow? Now although it is true that if we take the eggs before
the first sign of an embryo has appeared we may not be able to detect
any physical or chemical difference that would seem to account for the
difference in the result, yet we know the why and wherefore of that
difference. A swallow's egg cannot hatch out a lark because of the
difference in heredity. The countless influences that affected the
ancestors of that egg, and the numberless actions performed under those
influences are in some mysterious way stored up in that egg, and must
bear their own fruit and none other. Therefore a swallow's egg cannot
hatch out a lark, because a lark is the result of an entirely different
set of conditions; as we might say, its karma is different. But of
course the Buddhists do not mean heredity when they use the word
*karma*. 'Karma' expresses, not that which a man inherits from his
ancestors, but that which he inherits from himself in some previous
state of existence. But with this difference the Buddhist doctrine and
the scientific doctrine of heredity seem very similar.

   Not all deeds, however, are fruitful and perpetuate existence. Karma
is like heredity in that it is an informing principle which must have an
embodiment. Just as the informing principle of an egg would never find
expression without the accompaniment of yolk, albumen, and other
material constituents, so karma embeds itself in objects of desire in
order to form that factitious entity which goes by the name of man. If
karma be performed in a state of pure passionlessness, that is, without
attachment to anything, then it is barren. The fruitful karma will be
quickly undermined and not suffered to bear the full fruit it otherwise
would have done. Like a tree whose nourishment has been poisoned, the
being who <span id="page_212">p. 212</span> performs such karma will
cease to be. See § 40, § 76 in Chapter IV, and § 41, which last is given
by way of illustration of § 40 *b*. Thus a being without karma is as
arbitrary a conception as a chicken without heredity, that is, one
formed by creative fiat independent of antecedent conditions.

   In illustration of the doctrine of repeated existence I give at the
end of this chapter a number of "Birth-Stories," as they are called;
namely, stories concerning the anterior "births" or existences of The
Buddha. There is a separate work in the Buddhist Scriptures called the
"Jâtaka," or "Book of Birth-Stories," containing several hundred such
tales. They form a mine of folk-lore, and, though credited to The
Buddha, can hardly have been original with him. The ancient Buddhists,
like other Orientals, appear to have been fond of gathering together in
little companies and listening while some one of their number related a
tale or fable; and ancient Buddhist sculptures have come down to the
present day representing scenes taken out of these same stories that
fill the Jâtaka. Some of these tales are much traveled ones, and are to
be found in Æsop's Fables, and in La Fontaine, and other European works.
As a sample I give "The Ass in the Lion's Skin." Another instance of
folk-lore common to both the Orient and the Occident, but not given as a
Birth-Story, occurs in this chapter. The Pâli version is entitled
"Death's Messengers," while "The Three Warnings" gives the same general
idea in English dress. There are other English versions extant, and
German, French, and Latin ones, so that this is an interesting instance
of how a fable will travel about from country to country and from clime
to clime, varying in dress to suit the habits, customs, and ways of
thinking of the different peoples who adopt it into their literatures
and then often forget its alien origin.
