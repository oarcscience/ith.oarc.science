§ 16. ALL SIGNS OF AN EGO ARE ABSENT.

<span class="small">Translated from the Mahâ-Vagga
(i.6<sup>88</sup>).</span>

   Then The Blessed One addressed the band of five priests:--

   "Form, O priests, is not an Ego. For if now, O priests, this form
were an Ego, then would not this form tend towards destruction, and it
would be possible to say of form, 'Let my form be this way; let not my
form be that way!' But inasmuch, O priests, as form is not an Ego,
therefore does form tend towards destruction, and it is not possible to
say of form, 'Let my form be this way; let not my form be that way!'

   "Sensation . . . perception . . . the predispositions . . .
consciousness, is not an Ego. For if now, O priests, this consciousness
were an Ego, then would not this consciousness tend towards destruction,
and it would be possible to say of consciousness, 'Let my consciousness
be this way; let not my consciousness be that way!' But inasmuch, O
priests, as consciousness is not an Ego, therefore does consciousness
tend towards destruction, and it is not possible to say of
consciousness, 'Let my consciousness be this way; let not my
consciousness be that way!'

   "What think you, O priests? Is form permanent, or transitory?"

|                                   |                                                  |

   "It is transitory, Reverend Sir."

   "And that which is transitory--is it evil, or is it good?"

   "It is evil, Reverend Sir."

   "And that which is transitory, evil, and liable to change --is it
possible to say of it: 'This is mine; this am I; this is my Ego'?"

   "Nay, verily, Reverend Sir."

   "Is sensation . . . perception . . . the predispositions . . .
consciousness, permanent, or transitory?"

   "It is transitory, Reverend Sir."

   "And that which is transitory--is it evil, or is it good?"

   "It is evil, Reverend Sir."

   "And that which is transitory, evil, and liable to change --is it
possible to say of it: 'This is mine; this am I; this is my Ego'?"

   "Nay, verily, Reverend Sir."

   "Accordingly, O priests, as respects all form whatsoever, past,
future, or present, be it subjective or existing outside, gross or
subtile, mean or exalted, far or near, the correct view in the light of
the highest knowledge is as follows: 'This is not mine; this am I not;
this is not my Ego.'

   "As respects all sensation whatsoever . . . as respects all
perception whatsoever . . . as respects all predispositions whatsoever .
. . as respects all consciousness whatsoever, past, future, or present,
be it subjective or existing outside, gross or subtile, mean or exalted,
far or near, the correct view in the light of the highest knowledge is
as follows: 'This is not mine; this am I not; this is not my Ego.'

   "Perceiving this, O priests, the learned and noble disciple conceives
an aversion for form, conceives an aversion for sensation, conceives an
aversion for perception, conceives an aversion for the predispositions,
conceives an aversion for consciousness. And in conceiving this aversion
he becomes divested of passion, and by the absence of passion he becomes
free, and when he is free he becomes aware that he is free; and he knows
that rebirth is exhausted, that he has lived the holy life, that he has
done what it behooved him to do, and that he is no more for this world."

|                                   |                                                  |

   Thus spake The Blessed One, and the delighted band of five priests
applauded the speech of The Blessed One. Now while this exposition was
being delivered, the minds of the five priests became free from
attachment and delivered from the depravities.

   Now at that time there were six saints in the world.
