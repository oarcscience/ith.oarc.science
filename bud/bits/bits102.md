§ 102. THE BUDDHIST APOCALYPSE.

<span class="small"></span>

   <span class="small">\[The following is the account given by Prof. J.
Minayeff, of St. Petersburg, of the second of the Manuscripts used by
him in editing the Anâgata-Vamsa (History of Future Events), but with
the Pâli passages translated into English. See *Journal of the Pâli Text
Society* for 1886, page 33.\]</span>

   <span class="small">II.B. A MS. on paper, 24 pages, marked by the
letters (k-b). It is a copy from the MS. in the Library of Mg. Hpo Hmyin

begins--</span>

<span class="small">Hail to that Blessed One, that Saint, and Supreme
Buddha!</span>

   Thus have I heard.

   On a certain occasion The Blessed One was dwelling at Kapilavatthu in
Banyan Grove on the banks of the Rohanî River.

   Then the venerable Sâriputta questioned The Blessed One concerning
the future Conqueror:

"The Hero that shall follow you  
As Buddha, of what sort is he?  
Th' account in full I fain would learn.  
Declare to me, thou Seeing One."  

When he had heard the elder's speech,  
The Blessed One vouchsafed reply:  
"I'll tell it thee. Sâriputta,  
Pray lend your ears, for I will speak.  

|                                   |                                                     |

"Our cycle is a happy one,  
Three Leaders have already lived,  
Kakusandha, Konâgamana,  
And eke the leader Kassapa.  

"The Buddha now Supreme am I,  
But after me Metteyya comes,  
While still this happy cycle lasts,  
Before its tale of years shall lapse.  

"This Buddha, then, Metteyya called,  
Supreme, and of all men the chief--"  

   Then follows a history of the previous existence of Metteyyo, with
the three Buddhas, *Sumitto*, *Metteyyo*, and *Muhutto*, during
twenty-seven Buddhas, and finally at the time of the Buddha gotama, when
he was born as son of Ajâtaçattu, prince of Ajita (pp. ka--ca). On page
*ca* begins the future history of Metteyya with a quotation of the
recension compiled in verse. Then follows the description of the gradual
declension of the holy religion:

   "How will it occur? After my decease, first will occur the five
disappearances. And what are the five disappearances? The disappearance
of the attainments, the disappearance of the method, the disappearance
of learning, the disappearance of the symbols, the disappearance of the
relics. These are the five disappearances that are to occur.

   "First:--

   "*The attainments*:--Only for a thousand years from the time The
Blessed One passes into Nirvana will the priests be able to acquire the
analytical sciences. Then as time goes on my disciples will attain only
to never returning, to once returning, to conversion. As long as such
exist the disappearance of the attainments will not yet have occurred.
But with the death of the last disciple that has attained to conversion
the attainments will have disappeared.

   "This, O Sâriputta, is the disappearance of the attainments.

   "*Disappearance of the method*:--My disciples being unable

|                                   |                                                      |
|:----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_483">p. 483</span> | <span class="small">\[JPTS'86,34<sup>33</sup></span> |

to realize the trances, the insights, the Paths, and the Fruits, will
keep only the four purities of conduct. Then as time goes on they will
keep only the commandments forbidding the four deadly sins. As long as
there are a hundred or a thousand priests who keep the commandments
forbidding the four deadly sins, the disappearance of the method will
not have occurred. But when the last priest shall break the precepts, or
shall die, the method will have disappeared.

   "This, O Sâriputta, is the disappearance of the method.

   "*Disappearance of learning*:--As long as the text of the Three
Baskets, which is the word of The Buddha, and as long as their
commentaries are extant, the disappearance of learning will not have
occurred. But as time goes on there will be irreligious kings of base
extraction, and the courtiers and others in authority will be
irreligious, and then the country people throughout the kingdom will be
irreligious. On account of their irreligion the god will not rain in due
season, and the crops will not flourish properly. And when the crops do
not flourish, those who are wont to give the reliances to the
congregation of the priests will be unable to do so any more. And the
priests, not receiving the reliances, will not teach the novices, and as
time goes on learning will disappear. When it disappears, it is the
Great Work \[i.e. Patthâna. See [page xviii](bit-gint.htm#page_xviii)\]
that first disappears; when that has disappeared, then the Yamaka, the
Kathâ-Vatthu, the Puggala-Paññatti, the Dhâtu-Kathâ, the Vibhanga, and
the Dhamma-Sangani do so. When the Abhidhamma-Pitaka has disappeared,
the Suttanta-Pitaka will also disappear. When the Suttanta disappears,
it is first the Anguttara-Nikâya that disappears, and when the
Anguttara-Nikâya disappears, then the Samyutta-Nikâya, the
Majjhima-Nikâya, the Dîgha-Nikâya, the Khuddaka-Nikâya will disappear.
My disciples will only remember the Jâtaka together with the
Vinaya-Pitaka. It is, however, only the well-conducted priests that will
remember the Vinaya-Pitaka. But as time goes on they will be unable to
remember the Jâtaka, and first the Vessantara Birth-Story will
disappear, and when the Vessantara Birth-Story has disappeared . . . the
Apannaka Birth-Story will disappear. When the Jâtaka

|                                   |                                                      |
|:----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_484">p. 484</span> | <span class="small">\[JPTS'86,35<sup>25</sup></span> |

has disappeared, they will only remember the Vinaya-Pitaka. As time goes
on the Vinaya-Pitaka will disappear, but as long as a four-line stanza
remains among men, so long the disappearance of learning will not have
occurred. But when a pious king shall cause a purse containing a
thousand pieces of money to be placed in a golden casket on the back of
an elephant, and shall cause proclamation up to the second and third
time to be made throughout the city to the sound of the drum, as
follows: 'Anyone who knows a single stanza spoken by The BuddhasB, let
him take these thousand coins together with this elephant,' and yet
shall fail to find anyone who knows a four-line stanza, and shall
receive again the purse containing the thousand pieces into the royal
palace, then the disappearance of learning will have occurred.

   "This, O Sâriputta, is the disappearance of learning.

   "Now as time goes on the last of the priests will carry their robes,
their bowls, and their tooth-sticks after the manner of the naked
ascetics. They will take a bottle-gourd, make of it a begging-bowl, and
carry it in their arms, or in their hands, or in the balance of a
carrying-pole. And as time goes on a priest will say, 'What is the good
of this yellow robe?' and cut a small piece of yellow cloth, and tie it
around his neck, or his ears, or his hair, and devote himself to
husbandry or trade and the like, and to taking care of wife and
children. Then he will give gifts to the southern congregation. And the
fruit of this gift, say I, will be a myriadfold. As time goes on the
priests will say, 'What do we want with this?' and they will throw away
the piece of yellow cloth and persecute the wild animals and birds of
the forest, and thus the disappearance of the symbols will have
occurred.

   "This, O Sâriputta, is *the disappearance of the symbols*.

   "Thereupon, the dispensation of The Supreme Buddha being now five
thousand years old, the relics will begin to fail of honor and worship,
and will go wherever they can receive honor and worship. But as time
goes on they will not receive honor and worship in any place. Then, when
the dispensation has disappeared, the relics will come from every place;
from the serpent world, from the world of the gods, and from the

|                                   |                                                      |

Brahma-world; and having congregated together at the throne under the
Great Bo-tree, they will make an effigy of The Buddha and perform a
miracle resembling the double-miracle, and will teach the Doctrine. Not
a single human being will be found at that place; but all the gods from
ten thousand worlds will come together and listen to the Doctrine, and
many thousands of them will attain to the Doctrine. And these will cry
aloud, saying, 'Divine sirs, on the seventh day from now our One
Possessing the Ten Forces will pass into Nirvana.' Then they will weep,
saying, 'From henceforth we shall be in darkness.' Then the relics will
put forth flames of fire and burn up that effigy without remainder.

   "This, O Sâriputta, is *the disappearance of the relics*."

   Immediately after this, there follows an account of the destruction
of the Kappa \[World-Cycle\]. The verse recension does not run on
continuously in the compilation. The verses are interrupted by prose
insertion, *e. g.*, on page *na* there is inserted the ancient history
of Mahâpanâda; on page *tha* there is a description of the capital of
King Sankha. Further on page *da* there is described the attainment of
*pâramita* \[the Perfections\], the conception and birth of *Metteyya*,
his palaces, his life there, his departure from home, and his death. On
page *na* is depicted the sacred tree and the body of the future
teacher. This recension ends thus:

   f. \[i.e., Folio\] *ba*. "But who shall not behold Metteyya, The
Blessed One? and who shall behold him?

   "One who creates a schism in a church, as it is said, 'Devadatta
remains in hell for the entire world-cycle,' as well as all others born
in the Avîci hell, from performing the five crimes that constitute
'proximate karma,' those cherishing wholly heretical views, and those
who slander the noble disciples, shall not see him. The naked ascetics
who create a schism by denying the congregation allowable privileges
shall not see him. All other beings who give gifts, keep the precepts,
keep fast-days, fulfil their religious duties, found shrines, plant
sacred fig-trees, parks and groves, make bridges, clear the highways,
take their stand in the precepts, and dig wells, shall see him. Those
who, in their longing for a Blessed One, shall

|                                   |                                                      |
|:----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_486">p. 486</span> | <span class="small">\[JPTS'86,37<sup>14</sup></span> |

make a gift even if only of a handful of flowers, or of a single lamp,
or of a mouthful of food, shall see him. Those who feel pleasure at
meritorious deeds shall see him. Those who further the religion of The
Buddha, prepare the pavilion and the seats for the preachers of the
Doctrine, bring forward the fan, make offerings of cloth, canopies,
garlands, incense, or lamps, or are stanch sustainers of the
ministrations of the Doctrine, shall see him. Those who listen to the
Vessantara Birth-Story shall see him, likewise those who give to the
congregation offerings of food etc. shall see him. Those who wait on
their mothers and their fathers, and perform respectful duties for their
elders among their kinsfolk shall see him. Those who give ticket-food,
fortnightly food, and food on fast-days, those who practise the ten
means of acquiring merit shall see him. And when they have listened to
the Doctrine of The Blessed Metteyya, they shall attain to saintship."

   Then our Blessed One, in order to show who of those about him were to
become Buddhas, said:

"Metteyya excellent, Râma,  
Pasenadi Kosala, 'Bhibhû,  
Dîghasoni and Samkacca,  
Subha, the Brahman Todeyya,  

"Nâlâgiri, Palaleyya,  
These ten are Future Buddhas now,  
And in due course, in time to come,  
Wisdom Supreme shall they attain."
