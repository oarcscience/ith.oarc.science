§ 74. THE FOUR INTENT CONTEMPLATIONS.

{Mahâ-Satipatthâna-Sutta}

<span class="small">Translated from the Digha-Nikâya, and constituting
Sutta 22.</span>

   Thus have I heard.

   On a certain occasion The Blessed One was dwelling among the Kurus
where was the Kuru-town named Kammâsadhamma. And there The Blessed One
addressed the priests:

   "Priests," said he.

   "Lord!" said the priests in reply.

   And The Blessed One spoke as follows:--

   Priests, there is but one way open to mortals for the attainment of
purity, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the abolition
of misery and grief, for the acquisition of the correct rule of conduct,
for the realization of Nirvana, and that is the Four Intent
Contemplations.<span id="page_353_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span

| <span id="page_354">p. 354</span> | <span class="small">\[MSS.8<sup>8</sup></span> |

   And what are the four?

   Whenever, O priests, a priest lives, as respects the body, observant
of the body, strenuous, conscious, contemplative, and has rid himself of
lust and grief; as respects sensations, observant of sensations,
strenuous, conscious, contemplative, and has rid himself of lust and
grief; as respects the mind, observant of the mind, strenuous,
conscious, contemplative, and has rid himself of lust and grief; as
respects the elements of being, observant of the elements of being,
strenuous, conscious, contemplative, and has rid himself of lust and
grief.

   And how, O priests, does a priest live, as respects the body,
observant of the body?

   Whenever, O priests, a priest, retiring to the forest, or to the foot
of a tree, or to an uninhabited spot,<span

contemplates his expirations, and contemplates his inspirations, and in
making a long expiration thoroughly comprehends the long expiration he
is making, and in making a long inspiration thoroughly comprehends the
long inspiration he is making, and in making a short expiration
thoroughly comprehends the short expiration he is making, and in making
a short inspiration thoroughly comprehends the short inspiration he is
making, and trains himself to be conscious of all his expirations, and
trains himself to be conscious of all his inspirations, and trains
himself to quiet his expirations, and trains himself to quiet his
inspirations.<span id="page_355_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span

turner, or turner's apprentice, in making a long turn of the wheel
thoroughly comprehends the long turn of the wheel he is making, and in
making a short turn of the wheel thoroughly comprehends the short turn
of the wheel he is making; in exactly the same way, O priests, a priest,
in making a long expiration thoroughly comprehends the long expiration
he is making, and in making a long inspiration thoroughly comprehends
the long inspiration he is making, and in making a short expiration
thoroughly comprehends the short expiration he is making, and in making

making, and trains himself to be conscious of all his expirations, and
trains himself to be conscious of all his inspirations, and trains
himself to quiet his expirations, and trains himself to quiet his

   Thus he lives, either in his own person, as respects the body,
observant of the body, or in other persons, as respects the body,
observant of the body, or both in his own person and in other persons,
as respects the body, observant of the body; either observant of
origination in the body, or observant of destruction in the body, or
observant of both origination and destruction in the body; and the
recognition of the body by his intent contemplation<span

of this knowledge, merely to the extent of this contemplation, and he
lives unattached, nor clings to anything in the world.

   Thus, O priests, does a priest live, as respects the body, observant
of the body.

   Thus he lives, either in his own person, as respects the body,

lives unattached, nor clings to anything in the world.

   Thus, O priests, does a priest live, as respects the body, observant
of the body.

   But again, O priests, a priest, in advancing and retiring has an
accurate comprehension of what he does; in looking and gazing has an
accurate comprehension of what he does; in drawing in his arm and in
stretching out his arm has an accurate comprehension of what he does; in
wearing his cloak, his bowl, and his robes has an accurate comprehension
of what he does; in eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting has an
accurate comprehension of what he does; in easing his bowels and his
bladder has an accurate comprehension of what he does; in walking,
standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, talking, and being silent has an
accurate comprehension of what he does.

   Thus he lives, either in his own person \[etc., as before\].

   But again, O priests, a priest, considers this body upwards from the
soles of the feet, and downwards from the crown of the head, enclosed by
skin, and full of all manner of uncleanness, saying, "There is in this
body hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh,

lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, faeces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood,
sweat, fat, tears, lymph, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine." Just as
if, O priests, there were a double-mouthed vessel full of various sorts
of grain, to wit, sâli-rice, common paddy, beans, pulse, sesame, and
husked rice; and some intelligent man were to open it and consider its
contents, saying, "This is sâli-rice, this is common paddy, these are
beans, this is pulse, this is sesame, this is husked rice;" in exactly

doing, or however it may be situated, and considers it according to the
elements of which it is composed, saying,

   "There are in this body the elements earth, water, fire, and wind."
Just as, O priests, a skilful butcher, or butcher's apprentice, having
slaughtered a heifer, divides her into pieces, and stations himself at a
place where four roads meet; in exactly the same way, O priests, a
priest takes this body,<span id="page_360_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span

   But again, O priests, a priest lives, as respects the elements of
being, observant of the elements of being in the four noble truths.

   And how, O priests, does a priest live, as respects the elements of
being, observant of the elements of being in the four noble truths?

   Whenever, O priest, a priest knows the truth concerning misery, knows
the truth concerning the origin of misery, knows the truth concerning
the cessation of misery, knows the truth concerning the path leading to
the cessation of misery.

   And what, O priests, is the noble truth of misery?

   Birth is misery; old age is misery; disease is misery; death is
misery; sorrow, lamentation, misery, grief, and despair are misery; to
wish for what one cannot have is misery; in short, all the five
attachment-groups are misery.

   And what, O priests, is birth?

   When of such and such a being, into such and such a class of beings,
takes place the birth, the being born, the descent into the womb, the
rebirth, the appearance of the groups, the obtaining of the organs of
sense, this, O priests, is called birth.

   And what, O priests, is old age?

   When to such and such a being, in such and such a class of beings,
there comes old age, decrepitude, toothlessness, hoariness, wrinkledness
of the skin, subsidence of the vital powers, decay of the faculties,
this, O priests, is called old age.

   And what, O priests, is death?

   When of such and such a being, from such and such a class of beings,
takes place the passing, the passing away, the breaking up, the
disappearance, the dying, the death, the meeting its end, the breaking
up of the groups, the laying away of the corpse, this, O priests, is
called death.

   And what, O priests, is sorrow?

   Whenever, O priests, in any one who has experienced some great loss,
or is afflicted by some misfortune, there arises sorrow, sorrowing,
sorrowfulness, heart-sorrow, heart-sorrowfulness, this, O priests, is
called sorrow.

   And what, O priests, is lamentation?

   Whenever, O priests, any one who has experienced some

|                                   |                                                 |
|:----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_369">p. 369</span> | <span class="small">\[MSS.72<sup>7</sup></span> |

great loss, or is afflicted by some misfortune, gives way to lamenting,
lamentation, laments, lamenting cries, lamentable cries, cries of
lamentation, this, O priests, is called lamentation.

   And what, O priests, is misery?

   Bodily misery, O priests, bodily discomfort, misery and sensations of
discomfort experienced in the impressions received by the body, this, O
priests, is called misery.

   And what, O priests, is grief?

   Mental misery, O priests, mental discomfort, misery and sensations of
discomfort experienced in the impressions received by the mind, this, O
priests, is called grief.

   And what, O priests, is despair?

   Whenever, O priests, in any one who has experienced some great loss,
or is afflicted by some misfortune, there arises desperation, despair, a
state of desperation, a state of despair, this, O priests, is called
despair.

   And what, O priests, is meant by saying, "To wish for what one cannot
have is misery?"

   In beings, O priests, subject to birth there arises the wish, "O that
we were not subject to birth! O that birth might never come to us!"
Nevertheless this cannot be obtained by wishing. This is what is meant
by saying, "To wish for what one cannot have is misery."

   To beings, O priests, subject to old age . . . disease . . . death .
. . sorrow . . . lamentation . . . misery . . . grief . . . despair
there arises the wish, "O that we were not subject to despair! O that
despair might never come to us!" Nevertheless this cannot be obtained by
wishing. This is what is meant by saying, "To wish for what one cannot
have is misery."

   And what, O priests, are meant by saying, "In short, all the five
attachment-groups are misery?" The form-attachment-group, the
sensation-attachment-group, the perception-attachment-group, the
predisposition-attachment-group, the
consciousness-attachment-group,--these, O priests, are what are meant by
saying, "In short, all the five attachment-groups are misery."

   This, O priests, is called the noble truth of misery.

   And what, O priests, is the noble truth of the origin of misery?

   It is desire leading to rebirth, joining itself to pleasure and
passion, and finding delight in every existence,--desire, namely, for
sensual pleasure, desire for permanent existence, desire for transitory
existence.

   But where, O priests, does this desire spring up and grow? where does
it settle and take root?

   Where anything is delightful and agreeable to men, there desire
springs up and grows, there it settles and takes root.

up, a loosing hold, a relinquishment, and a non-adhesion.

it broken up and destroyed?

misery.

<span class="small">End of the Exposition of the Cessation of

   And what, O priests, is the noble truth of the path leading to the
cessation of misery?

|                                   |                                                   |

   It is this noble eightfold path, to wit, right belief, right resolve,
right speech, right behavior, right occupation, right effort, right
contemplation, right concentration.

   And what, O priests, is right belief?

   The knowledge of misery, O priests, the knowledge of the origin of
misery, the knowledge of the cessation of misery, and the knowledge of
the path leading to the cessation of misery, this, O priests, is called
"right belief."

   And what, O priests, is right resolve?

   The resolve to renounce sensual pleasures, the resolve to have malice
towards none, and the resolve to harm no living creature, this, O
priests, is called "right resolve."

   And what, O priests, is right speech?

   To abstain from falsehood, to abstain from backbiting, to abstain
from harsh language, and to abstain from frivolous talk, this, O
priests, is called "right speech."

   And what, O priests, is right behavior?

   To abstain from destroying life, to abstain from taking that which is
not given one, and to abstain from immorality, this, O priests, is
called "right behavior."

   And what, O priests, is right occupation?

   Whenever, O priests, a noble disciple, quitting a wrong occupation,
gets his livelihood by a right occupation, this, O priests, is called
"right occupation."

   And what, O priests, is right effort?

   Whenever, O priests, a priest purposes, makes an effort, heroically
endeavors, applies his mind, and exerts himself that evil and
demeritorious qualities not yet arisen may not arise; purposes, makes an
effort, heroically endeavors, applies his mind, and exerts himself that
evil and demeritorious qualities already arisen may be abandoned;
purposes, makes an effort, heroically endeavors, applies his mind, and
exerts himself that meritorious qualities not yet arisen may arise;
purposes, makes an effort, heroically endeavors, applies his mind, and
exerts himself for the preservation, retention, growth, increase,
development, and perfection of meritorious qualities already arisen,
this, O priest, is called "right effort."

   And what, O priests, is right contemplation?

   Whenever, O priests, a priest lives, as respects the body, observant
of the body, strenuous, conscious, contemplative, and has rid himself of
lust and grief; as respects sensations, observant of sensations,
strenuous, conscious, contemplative, and has rid himself of lust and
grief; as respects the mind, observant of the mind, strenuous,
conscious, contemplative, and has rid himself of lust and grief; as
respects the elements of being, observant of the elements of being,
strenuous, conscious, contemplative, and has rid himself of lust and
grief, this, O priests, is called "right contemplation."

   And what, O priests, is right concentration?

   Whenever, O priests, a priest, having isolated himself from sensual
pleasures, having isolated himself from demeritorious traits, and still
exercising reasoning, still exercising reflection, enters upon the first
trance which is produced by isolation and characterized by joy and
happiness; when, through the subsidence of reasoning and reflection, and
still retaining joy and happiness, he enters upon the second trance,
which is an interior tranquilization and intentness of the thoughts, and
is produced by concentration; when, through the paling of joy,
indifferent, contemplative, conscious, and in the experience of bodily
happiness--that state which eminent men describe when they say,
"Indifferent, contemplative, and living happily"--he enters upon the
third trance; when, through the abandonment of happiness, through the
abandonment of misery, through the disappearance of all antecedent
gladness and grief, he enters upon the fourth trance, which has neither
misery nor happiness, but is contemplation as refined by indifference,
this, O priests, is called "right concentration."

   This, O priests, is called the noble truth of the path leading to the
cessation of misery.

<span class="small">End of the Exposition of the Path Leading to the

   Thus he lives, either in his own person, as respects the elements of
being, observant of the elements of being, or in other persons, as
respects the elements of being, observant of

|                                   |                                                   |

the elements of being, or both in his own person and in other persons,
as respects the elements of being, observant of the elements of being;
either observant of origination in the elements of being, or observant
of destruction in the elements of being, or observant of both
origination and destruction in the elements of being; and the
recognition of the elements of being by his intent contemplation is
merely to the extent of this knowledge, merely to the extent of this
contemplation, and he lives unattached, nor clings to anything in the
world.

   Thus, O priests, does a priest live, as respects the elements of
being, observant of the elements of being.

   Any one, O priests, who for seven years shall thus practise these
Four Intent Contemplations, may expect one or the other of two
rewards--either he will attain to perfect knowledge in his present life,
or, if at death the groups still remain, to never returning.

   But setting aside, O priests, all question of seven years, any one, O
priests, who for six years shall thus practise the above Four Intent
Contemplations, may expect one or the other of two rewards--either he
will attain to perfect knowledge in his present life, or, if at death

of purity, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the
abolition of misery and grief, for the acquisition of the correct rule
of conduct, for the realization of Nirvana, and that is the Four Intent
Contemplations."

   Thus spake The Blessed One, and the delighted priests applauded the
speech of The Blessed One.

basket-maker, desirous of making coarse and fine mats, and baskets,
crates, hampers, and other like ware, might divide a large stalk of
bamboo into four parts, and then take some one of these sections, split
it, and make the required articles; in exactly the same way The Blessed
One, desirous of establishing for living beings a number of avenues to
proficiency, divides Right Contemplation, which is in fact but one, into
four parts based on the subject-matter, saying, *There are Four Intent
Contemplations. And what are the four? Whenever, O priests, a priest
lives, as respects the body, observant of the body,* etc., and then

*Retiring to the forest, or to the foot of a tree, or to an uninhabited
spot*--This explains what dwelling-places should be chosen as
appropriate to the exercise of intent contemplation, For in the case of
this priest, his mind, having long spent itself on forms and the other
objects of sense, does not readily apply itself to a subject of
meditation: like a chariot harnessed to vicious oxen, it runs off the
track. Therefore, even as a cowherd, desirous of breaking in a calf
vicious from having been brought up on the milk of a vicious cow, will
lead it away from its mother and tie it with a halter to a post planted
somewhere out of her way; and even as the calf springing hither and
thither and finding itself unable to escape will sit or lie down close
by the post; in exactly the same way this priest, desirous of breaking
in his mind, spoiled from having been brought up on the sweets of forms
and of the other objects of sense, must resort to the forest, or to the
foot of a tree, or to an uninhabited spot, and there with the bond of
contemplation bind it to some object of intent contemplation, as it were
to a post. Thus will his mind, springing hither and thither and finding
none of its accustomed objects, be unable to break the bond of
contemplation and escape, and will settle down and lie close to the
object of meditation, and attain either to neighborhood-concentration or
to attainment-concentration. Therefore has it been said by the ancients:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />

So should one fasten one's own mind<br />

</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Thus such dwelling-places are appropriate to these exercises. Therefore
have I stated: "This explains what dwelling-places should be chosen as
appropriate to the exercise of intent contemplation."

In thus training himself, he obtains the four trances through the reflex
of his respirations. And rising from his trance he investigates either
his expirations and inspirations, or else the members of his trances. He
who makes use of his respirations first investigates form, saying,

"On what are these expirations and inspirations based? They are based on
matter, and matter is the material body, and the material body is the
four elements and form derivative from them." Secondly: "Name rests on
the same \[four elements\] with the addition of contact." When he has
thus grasped name, he searches for its dependence, and perceives
ignorance and the rest of Dependent Origination, and thinking, "Name and
form are merely dependence or else sprung from dependence; there is
nothing else to form the living entity or Ego," he leaves all doubt
behind, and strengthening his insight by the application of the Three
Characteristics to dependent name and form, by degrees attains to
saintship. This is how this priest sets out on his way towards
saintship.

He who makes use of his trance determines name and form in the following
manner: "On what are the members of my trance based? They are based on
matter, and matter is the material body, and the members of my trance
are form in the material body." Then he searches for the dependence of
name and form, and perceives ignorance etc., or the formula of
dependence, and thinking, "Name and form are merely dependence or else
sprung from dependence; there is nothing else to form the living entity
or Ego," he leaves all doubt behind, and strengthening his insight by
the application of the Three Characteristics to dependent name and form,
by degrees attains to saintship. This is how this priest sets out on his

Having thus made of the respirations one division of the observation of
the body, he now of the bodily postures makes another, and begins with
the words, *But again*.

Now it is true that dogs, jackals, and other animals, when they walk,
have knowledge of their walking; however, it is not with respect to
knowledge of that kind that this is spoken. For such knowledge as that
does not abandon the assumption of a living entity, and does not show up
that belief; nor is any subject of meditation present, nor any intent
contemplation. But the knowledge of this priest abandons the assumption
of a living entity, shows up that belief; and a subject of meditation is
present, and intent contemplation. For this was spoken with respect to
complete knowledge, comprising such points as, "Who is it walks? Whose
walking is it? What makes it walk?" And similarly also in regard to
standing and the other bodily postures.

Now when it is asked, "*Who is it walks?*" the answer is that it is no
living entity or Ego that walks. And when it is asked, "*Whose walking
is it?*" the answer is that it is not the walking of any living entity
or Ego. And when it is asked, "*What makes it walk?*" the answer is that
walking takes place through the action of the mind, and permeation by
the windy element. The following, therefore, is what he thoroughly
comprehends: The thought of walking arises, and that produces the windy
element, and the windy element shows itself in the action. The pulling
forward of the whole body brought about by the action of the mind and
permeation by the windy element is what is called walking. The
explanation of standing and of the other bodily postures is similar. As
follows:--

The thought of standing arises, and that produces the windy element, and
the windy element shows itself in the action. The erectness of the whole
body brought about by the action of the mind and permeation by the windy
element is what is called standing.

The thought of sitting arises, and that produces the windy element, and
the windy element shows itself in the action. The drawing in of the
lower part of the body, and the erectness of the upper part brought
about by the action of the mind and permeation by the windy element is
what is called sitting.

The thought of lying down arises, and that produces the windy element,
and the windy element shows itself in the action. The stretching out of
the whole body horizontally brought about by the action of the mind and
permeation by the windy element is what is called lying down. When he
has thoroughly comprehended this, he thinks as follows:--

"They say it is a living entity that walks, it is a living entity that
stands; but is there any living entity to walk or to stand? There is
not. But even as people speak of a cart's going, though there is nothing
corresponding to the word cart to go or to stand, yet when the driver
has yoked up four oxen and drives them, we then, by a mere convention of
speech, talk of the cart's going or of the cart's standing; in exactly
the same way the body on account of its lack of intelligence resembles
the cart, the impulsions of the thoughts resemble the oxen, the thought
resembles the driver, and when the thought of walking or of standing
arises, the windy element arises and shows itself in the actions, and
walking etc. are brought about by this action of the mind and permeation
by the windy element, Accordingly, to say: 'It is a living entity that
walks, it is a living entity that stands; I walk, I stand,' is but a
mere convention of speech, Therefore has it been said,--

"'As ships are by the wind impelled,  
As arrows by the bow-string's force,  
Likewise this body is impelled,  
Smit by the windy element.  

"'Machines are geared to move by ropes;  
So, too, this body's enginery  
Is governed by a mental rope  
Whene'er it stands, whene'er it sits.  

"'What living entity is here  
That can by its intrinsic might  
Without dependence or a cause  
Make shift to stand or walk about?'"  

Therefore it is to be understood that it is through perceiving that
walking etc. have a dependence and are produced by causes that he *in
walking thoroughly comprehends his walking, and in standing . . .
sitting . . . lying down thoroughly comprehends his lying down*.

as a butcher, while rearing a cow, while leading her to the place of
slaughter, and while, after bringing her there and binding her, he is
placing her in position, slaughtering her, and handling her after she
has been slaughtered, never ceases to think of her as a cow so long as
he has not cut her up and divided her into pieces. But when he has
divided her into pieces, and has seated himself ready to sell, he ceases
to think of her as a cow, and thinks of her as only so much meat. He
does not think, "I am selling cow; my customers come to me for cow;"
but, "I am selling meat; my customers come to me for meat." In exactly
the same way, while a man is an ignorant, unconverted person, whether he
be a householder or a member of the Order, he never ceases to think of
himself as a living entity or individual, until such time as he *takes
this body, whatever it may be doing, or however it may be situated, and
analyzing it considers it according to the elements of which it is
composed*. But when he has considered it according to the elements of
which it is composed, he ceases to think of it as a living entity or
individual, and thinks of it as only so many elements.

<span id="page_362_note_1"></span>[1](#page_362_fr_1) In treating of the
contemplation of the body as one of the forty subjects of meditation
(see [page 292](bits060.htm#page_292)), Buddhaghosa, in chapter viii. of
the Visuddhi-Magga, takes up only the Section on Loathsomeness. He
mentions the First Intent Contemplation as above described, but says
that the Section on Breathing forms a subject of meditation by itself
(the contemplation of breathing), that the Section on Bodily Postures,
the Section on the Four Accurate Comprehensions, and the Section on the
Elements belong under Wisdom, and the Nine Cemeteries belong in a
measure under Wisdom and in a measure under the Impurities.

the observation of the body The Blessed One treated solely of form; in
the observation of the sensations and of thoughts, solely of the other
groups; but now with the words, *And how, O priests*, he begins the
treatment of form and of the other groups mixed. Or, again, in the
observation of the body it is only the form-group that is treated of, in
the observation of the sensations it is only the sensation-group, and in
the observation of thoughts it is only the consciousness-group; but now
with the words, *And how, O priests*, he begins the treatment of the
perception-group, and of the predisposition-group.

*Complete fading out and cessation*, etc. are all simply synonyms for
Nirvana. For in Nirvana there is a complete fading out and cessation of
desire; therefore is it called the complete fading out and cessation of
that desire. In Nirvana, also, desire decays, is relinquished, does not
adhere; therefore is Nirvana called a letting go, a loosing hold, a
relinquishment, and a non-adhesion. For Nirvana is but one, but its
names based on its oppositions are many. To wit, complete fading out,
complete cessation, a letting go, a loosing hold, a relinquishment, a
non-adhesion, the perishing of passion, the perishing of hatred, the
perishing of infatuation, the perishing of desire, non-origination, the
non-existent, the unconditioned, the desireless, the non-production of
karma, deliverance from conception, deliverance from rebirth,
deliverance from renewed existence, the unborn, the undecaying,
deliverance from disease, the deathless, the sorrowless, deliverance
from lamentation, deliverance from despair, the incorrupt, etc.
