§ 2. A LIST OF FORMER BUDDHAS.

<span class="small">Translated from the Introduction to the Jâtaka
(i.43<sup>28</sup>).</span>

   Now in the same world-cycle that saw Dîpamkara, The One Possessing
the Ten Forces, there were also three other Buddhas; but as none of them
prophesied concerning the Future Buddha, I have not mentioned them. In
the Commentary, however, all the Buddhas are mentioned from the
beginning of that world-cycle on, as follows:--

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>247.</td>
<td>"Tanhamkara, Medhamkara,<br />
And also Saranamkara,<br />
Dîpamkara, the Buddha great,<br />
Kondañña, of all men the chief,<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even" data-valign="top">

<td>"Mañgala, and Sumana too,<br />
Revata, Sobhita, the sage,<br />
Anomadassi, Paduma,<br />
Nârada, Padumuttara,<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>249.</td>
<td>"Sumedha, and Sujâta too,<br />
Piyadassi, the glorious one,<br />
Atthadassi, Dhammadassi,<br />
Siddhattha, guide of every man,<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even" data-valign="top">
<td>250.</td>
<td>"Tissa, Phussa, the Buddha great,<br />
Vipassi, Sikkhi, Vessabhû,<br />
Kakusandha, Konâgamana,<br />
Kassapa also, guide for men,--<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>251.</td>
<td>"All these aforetime Buddhas were,<br />
Tranquil, from every passion free.<br />
And like the sun, the many-rayed,<br />
They chased away the darkness dense,<br />
And having flamed like tongues of fire,<br />
Became extinct with all their train."<br />

   Our Future Buddha, in his passage through four immensities and a
hundred thousand world-cycles to the present time,

|                                 |                                                  |

has made his wish under twenty-four of these Buddhas beginning with
Dîpamkara. But since Kassapa, The Blessed One, there has been no Supreme
Buddha excepting our present one. Accordingly, our Future Buddha has
received recognition at the hands of twenty-four Buddhas beginning with
Dîpamkara.
