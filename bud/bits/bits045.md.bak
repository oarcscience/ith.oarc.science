§ 45. CAUSE OF REBIRTH.

<span class="small">Translated from the Milindapañha
(32<sup>12</sup>).</span>

   "Bhante Nâgasena," said the king, "are there any who die without
being born into another existence?"

   "Some are born into another existence," said the elder, "and some are
not born into another existence."

   "Who is born into another existence, and who is not born into another
existence?"

   "Your majesty, he that still has the corruptions is born into another
existence; he that no longer has the corruptions is not born into
another existence."

   "But will you, bhante, be born into another existence?"

   "Your majesty, if there shall be in me any attachment, I shall be
born into another existence; if there shall be in me no attachment, I
shall not be born into another existence."

   "You are an able man, bhante Nâgasena."
