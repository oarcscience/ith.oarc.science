§ 12. THE DEATH OF THE BUDDHA.

<span class="small">Translated from the Mahâ-Parinibbâna-Sutta (v. and
vi.) of the Digha-Nikâya.</span>

   T<span class="small">HEN</span> The Blessed One addressed the
venerable Ânanda:--

   "Let us go hence, Ânanda. To the further bank of the Hiraññavatî
river, and to the city of Kusinârâ and the sal-tree grove Upavattana of
the Mallas will we draw near."

   "Yes, Reverend Sir," said the venerable Ânanda to The Blessed One in
assent.

   Then The Blessed One, accompanied by a large congregation of priests,
drew near to the further bank of the Hiraññavatî river, and to the city
of Kusinârâ and the sal-tree grove Upavattana of the Mallas; and having
drawn near, he addressed the venerable Ânanda:--

   "Be so good, Ânanda, as to spread me a couch with its head to the
north between twin sal-trees. I am weary, Ânanda, and wish to lie down."

   "Yes, Reverend Sir," said the venerable Ânanda to The Blessed One in
assent, and spread the couch with its head to the north between twin
sal-trees. Then The Blessed One lay down on his right side after the
manner of a lion, and placing foot on foot, remained mindful and
conscious.

   Now at that time the twin sal-trees had completely burst forth into
bloom, though it was not the flowering season;

|                                 |                                                  |

| <span id="page_96">p. 96</span> | <span class="small">\[MPS.49<sup>13</sup></span> |

and the blossoms scattered themselves over the body of The
Tathâgata,<span id="page_96_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_96_note_1.md) and strewed and sprinkled
themselves in worship of The Tathâgata. Also heavenly Erythrina flowers
fell from the sky; and these scattered themselves over the body of The
Tathâgata, and strewed and sprinkled themselves in worship of The
Tathâgata. Also heavenly sandal-wood powder fell from the sky; and this
scattered itself over the body of The Tathâgata, and strewed and
sprinkled itself in worship of The Tathâgata. And music sounded in the
sky in worship of The Tathâgata, and heavenly choruses were heard to
sing in worship of The Tathâgata.

   Then The Blessed One addressed the venerable Ânanda:--

   "The twin sal-trees, Ânanda, have completely burst forth into bloom,
though it is not the flowering season; and the blossoms have scattered
themselves over the body of The Tathâgata, and have strewn and sprinkled
themselves in worship of The Tathâgata. Also heavenly Erythrina flowers
have fallen from the sky; and these have scattered themselves over the
body of The Tathâgata, and have strewn and sprinkled themselves in
worship of The Tathâgata. Also heavenly sandal-wood powder has fallen
from the sky; and this has scattered itself over the body of The
Tathâgata, and has strewn and sprinkled itself in worship of The
Tathâgata. Also music is sounding in the sky in worship of The
Tathâgata, and heavenly choruses are heard to sing in worship of The
Tathâgata. But it is not by all this, Ânanda, that The Tathâgata is
honored, esteemed, revered, worshiped, or venerated; but the priest,
Ânanda, or the priestess, or the lay disciple, or the female lay
disciple, who shall fulfil all the greater and lesser duties, conducting
himself with propriety and in accordance with the precepts, by him is
The Tathâgata honored, esteemed, revered, and worshiped with the best of
worship. Accordingly, Ânanda, train yourselves,

|                                 |                                                  |
|:--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_97">p. 97</span> | <span class="small">\[MPS.49<sup>37</sup></span> |

and fulfil all the greater and lesser duties, and conduct yourselves
with propriety and in accordance with the precepts."

   Now at that time the venerable Upavâna was standing in front of The
Blessed One, and fanning him. Then The Blessed One was harsh to the
venerable Upavâna saying,--

   "Step aside, O priest; stand not in front of me." Then it occurred to
the venerable Ânanda as follows:--

   "Here, this venerable Upavâna has for a long time been the
body-servant of The Blessed One, and kept himself at his beck and call;
yet, although his last moments are near, The Blessed One is harsh to the
venerable Upavâna saying, 'Step aside, O priest; stand not in front of
me.' What, pray, was the reason, and what was the cause, that The
Blessed One was harsh to the venerable Upavâna saying, 'Step aside, O
priest; stand not in front of me'?"

   Then the venerable Ânanda spoke to The Blessed One as follows:--

   "Reverend Sir, here this venerable Upavâna has for a long time been
the body-servant of The Blessed One, and kept himself at his beck and
call; yet, although his last moments are near, The Blessed One is harsh
to the venerable Upavâna saying, 'Step aside, O priest; stand not in
front of me.' Reverend Sir, what, pray, was the reason, and what was the
cause, that The Blessed One was harsh to the venerable Upavâna saying,
'Step aside, O priest; stand not in front of me'?"

   "Ânanda, almost all the deities throughout ten worlds have come
together to behold The Tathâgata. For an extent, Ânanda, of twelve
leagues about the city Kusinârâ and the sal-tree grove Upavattana of the
Mallas, there is not a spot of ground large enough to stick the point of
a hair into, that is not pervaded by powerful deities. And these
deities, Ânanda, are angered, saying, 'From afar have we come to behold
The Tathâgata, for but seldom, and on rare occasions, does a Tathâgata,
a saint, and Supreme Buddha arise in the world; and now, to-night, in
the last watch, will The Tathâgata pass into Nirvana; but this powerful
priest stands in front of The Blessed One, concealing him, and we have
no

| <span id="page_98">p. 98</span> | <span class="small">\[MPS.50<sup>26</sup></span> |

chance to see The Tathâgata, although his last moments are near.' Thus,
Ânanda, are these deities angered."

   "What are the deities doing, Reverend Sir, whom The Blessed One
perceives?"

   "Some of the deities, Ânanda, are in the air with their minds
engrossed by earthly things, and they let fly their hair and cry aloud,
and stretch out their arms and cry aloud, and fall headlong to the
ground and roll to and fro, saying, 'All too soon will The Blessed One
pass into Nirvana; all too soon will The Happy One pass into Nirvana;
all too soon will The Light of the World vanish from sight!' Some of the
deities, Ânanda, are on the earth with their minds engrossed by earthly
things, and they let fly their hair and cry aloud, and stretch out their
arms and cry aloud, and fall headlong on the ground and roll to and fro,
saying, 'All too soon will The Blessed One pass into Nirvana; all too
soon will The Happy One pass into Nirvana; all too soon will The Light
of the World vanish from sight.' But those deities which are free from
passion, mindful and conscious, bear it patiently, saying, 'Transitory
are all things. How is it possible \[that whatever has been born, has
come into being, and is organized and perishable, should not perish?
That condition is not possible.\]'"

.       .       .       .       .       .       .       .       .       .       .

<span class="small">(Chapter v., page 53<sup>16</sup>.)</span>

 

   Then the venerable Ânanda entered the monastery, and, leaning against
the bolt of the door, he wept, saying,--

   "Behold, I am but a learner and not yet perfect, and my Teacher is on
the point of passing into Nirvana, he who was so compassionate to me."

   Then The Blessed One addressed the priests:--

   "Where, O priests, is Ânanda?"

   "Reverend Sir, the venerable Ânanda has entered the monastery, and
leaning against the bolt of the door, he weeps, saying, 'Behold, I am
but a learner, and not yet perfect, and my Teacher is on the point of
passing into Nirvana, he who was so compassionate to me.'"

|                                 |                                                  |
|:--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_99">p. 99</span> | <span class="small">\[MPS.53<sup>23</sup></span> |

   Then The Blessed One addressed a certain priest, saying,--

   "Go, O priest, and say to the venerable Ânanda from me, 'The Teacher
calleth thee, brother Ânanda.'"

   "Yes, Reverend Sir," said the priest to The Blessed One in assent,
and drew near to where the venerable Ânanda was; and having drawn near,
he spoke to the venerable Ânanda as follows:--

   "The Teacher calleth thee, brother Ânanda."

   "Yes, brother," said the venerable Ânanda to the priest in assent,
and drew near to where The Blessed One was; and having drawn near and
greeted The Blessed One, he sat down respectfully at one side. And the
venerable Ânanda being seated respectfully at one side, The Blessed One
spoke to him as follows:--

   "Enough, Ânanda, do not grieve, nor weep. Have I not already told
you, Ânanda, that it is in the very nature of all things near and dear
unto us that we must divide ourselves from them, leave them, sever
ourselves from them? How is it possible, Ânanda, that whatever has been
born, has come into being, is organized and perishable, should not
perish? That condition is not possible. For a long time, Ânanda, have
you waited on The Tathâgata with a kind, devoted, cheerful,
single-hearted, unstinted service of body, with a kind, devoted,
cheerful, single-hearted, unstinted service of voice, with a kind,
devoted, cheerful, single-hearted, unstinted service of mind. You have
acquired much merit, Ânanda; exert yourself, and soon will you be free
from all depravity."

   Then The Blessed One addressed the priests:--

   "Priests, of all those Blessed Ones who aforetime were saints and
Supreme Buddhas, all had their favorite body-servants, just as I have
now my Ânanda. And, priests, of all those Blessed Ones who in the future
shall be saints and Supreme Buddhas, all will have their favorite
body-servants, just as I have now my Ânanda. Wise, O priests, is Ânanda
--he knows when it is a fit time to draw near to see The Tathâgata,
whether for the priests, for the priestesses, for the

|                                   |                                                  |

lay disciples, for the female lay disciples, for the king, for the
king's courtiers, for the leaders of heretical sects, or for their
adherents.

   "Ânanda, O priests, has four wonderful and marvellous qualities. And
what are the four? O priests, if an assembly of priests draw near to
behold Ânanda, it is delighted with beholding him; and if then Ânanda
hold a discourse on the Doctrine, it is also delighted with the
discourse; and when Ânanda, O priests, ceases to speak, the assembly of
priests is still unsated. O priests, if an assembly of priestesses . . .
an assembly of lay disciples . . . an assembly of female lay disciples
draw near to behold Ânanda, it is delighted with beholding him; and if
then Ânanda hold a discourse on the Doctrine, it is also delighted with
the discourse; and when Ânanda, O priests, ceases to speak, the assembly
of female lay disciples is still unsated.

   "A Universal Monarch, O priests, has four wonderful and marvellous
qualities. And what are the four? O priests, if an assembly of men of
the warrior caste . . . an assembly of men of the Brahman caste . . . an
assembly of householders . . . an assembly of monks draw near to behold
the Universal Monarch, it is delighted with beholding him; and if then
the Universal Monarch hold a discourse, it is also delighted with the
discourse; and when the Universal Monarch, O priests, ceases to speak,
the assembly of monks is still unsated.

   "In exactly the same way, O priests, Ânanda has four wonderful and
marvellous qualities. O priests, if an assembly of priests . . . an
assembly of priestesses . . . an assembly of lay disciples . . . an
assembly of female lay disciples draw near to behold Ânanda, it is
delighted with beholding him; and if then Ânanda hold a discourse on the
Doctrine, it is also delighted with the discourse; and when Ânanda, O
priests, ceases to speak, the assembly of female lay disciples is still
unsated. These, O priests, are the four wonderful and marvellous
qualities possessed by Ânanda."

   When The Blessed One had thus spoken, the venerable Ânanda spoke to
him as follows:--

   "Reverend Sir, let not The Blessed One pass into Nirvana

|                                   |                                                 |

in this wattel-and-daub town, this town of the jungle, this branch
village. For there are other great cities, Reverend Sir, to wit, Campâ,
Râjagaha, Sâvatthi, Sâketa, Kosambî, and Benares. Let The Blessed One
pass into Nirvana in one of them. In them are many wealthy men of the
warrior caste, many wealthy men of the Brahman caste, and many wealthy
householders who are firm believers in The Tathâgata, and they will
perform the funeral rites for The Tathâgata."

   "O Ânanda, say not so! O Ânanda, say not so, that this is a
wattel-and-daub town, a town of the jungle, a branch village. There was
once, Ânanda, a king called Sudassana the Great, who was a Universal
Monarch, a virtuous king of justice, a victorious ruler of the four
quarters of the earth, possessing a secure dominion over his territory
and owning the seven precious gems.<span
id="page_101_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_101_note_1.md) This city Kusinârâ,
Ânanda, was the capital of king Sudassana the Great, and had then the
name of Kusâvatî. From the east to the west it was twelve leagues in
length, and from the north to the south it was seven leagues in breadth.
Kusâvatî, the capital, Ânanda, was prosperous and flourishing, populous
and thronging with people, and well provided with food. As Âlakamandâ,
the capital of the gods, Ânanda, is prosperous and flourishing, populous
and thronging with gods, and is well provided with food, in exactly the
same way, Ânanda, Kusâvatî, the capital, was prosperous and flourishing,
populous and thronging with people, and well provided with food.
Kusâvatî, the capital, Ânanda, was neither by day nor night without the
ten noises,--to wit, the noise of elephants, the noise of horses, the
noise of chariots, the noise of drums, the noise of tabors, the noise of
lutes, the noise of song, the noise of cymbals, the noise of gongs, and
the tenth noise of people crying, 'Eat ye, and drink!'

   "Go thou, Ânanda, and enter the city Kusinârâ, and announce to the
Kusinârâ-Mallas:--

   "'To-night, O ye Vâsetthas, in the last watch, The

|                                   |                                                  |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_102">p. 102</span> | <span class="small">\[MPS.55<sup>28</sup></span> |

Tathâgata will pass into Nirvana. Be favorable, be favorable, O ye
Vâsetthas, and suffer not that afterwards ye feel remorse, saying, "The
Tathâgata passed into Nirvana while in our borders, but we did not avail
ourselves of the opportunity of being present at the last moments of The
Tathâgata."'"

   "Yes, Reverend Sir," said the venerable Ânanda to The Blessed One in
assent; and putting on his tunic, and taking his bowl and his robes, he
went to Kusinârâ with another member of the Order.

   Now at that time, the Kusinârâ-Mallas were assembled together in the
town-hall on some matter of business. And the venerable Ânanda drew near
to the town-hall of the Kusinârâ-Mallas; and having drawn near, he made
announcement to the Kusinârâ-Mallas, as follows:--

   "To-night, O ye Vâsetthas, in the last watch, The Tathâgata will pass
into Nirvana. Be favorable, be favorable, O ye Vâsetthas, and suffer not
that afterwards ye feel remorse, saying, 'The Tathâgata passed into
Nirvana while in our borders, but we did not avail ourselves of the
opportunity of being present at the last moments of The Tathâgata.'"

   The Mallas, on hearing this speech of the venerable Ânanda, and their
children and their daughters-in-law and their wives were grieved and
sorrowful and overwhelmed with anguish of mind, and some let fly their
hair and cried aloud, and stretched out their arms and cried aloud, and
fell headlong to the ground and rolled to and fro, saying, "All too soon
will The Blessed One pass into Nirvana; all too soon will The Happy One
pass into Nirvana; all too soon will The Light of the World vanish from
sight." Then the Mallas and their children and their daughters-in-law
and their wives, being grieved and sorrowful and overwhelmed with
anguish of mind, drew near to the sal-tree grove Upavattana of the
Mallas, and to where the venerable Ânanda was.

   Then it occurred to the venerable Ânanda as follows:--

   "If I shall cause the Kusinârâ-Mallas one by one to do reverence to
The Blessed One, the day will dawn ere they have finished. What if now I
marshal the Mallas by families,

|                                   |                                                  |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_103">p. 103</span> | <span class="small">\[MPS.56<sup>24</sup></span> |

and cause them by families to do reverence to The Blessed One, and say,
'Reverend Sir, a Malla named so-and-so, with his children, his wife, his
following, and his friends, bows low in reverence at the feet of The
Blessed One.'"

   And the venerable Ânanda marshalled the Mallas by families, and
caused them by families to do reverence to The Blessed One, Baying,
"Reverend Sir, a Malla named so-and-so, with his children, his wife, his
following, and his friends, bows low in reverence at the feet of The
Blessed One." And the venerable Ânanda by this device succeeded in
causing all the Kusinari-Mallas to do reverence to The Blessed One
before the end of the first watch of the night.

   Now at that time Subhadda, a wandering ascetic, was dwelling at
Kusinârâ. And Subhadda, the wandering ascetic, heard the report:--

   "To-night, in the last watch, the monk Gotama will pass into
Nirvana."

   Then it occurred to Subhadda, the wandering ascetic, as follows:--

   "I have heard wandering ascetics, that were old men, advanced in
years, teachers, and teachers' teachers, declare, 'But seldom, and on
rare occasions, does a Tathâgata, a saint, and Supreme Buddha arise in
the world.' And to-night, in the last watch, the monk Gotama will pass
into Nirvana. And a certain question has arisen in my mind, and I am
persuaded of the monk Gotama that he can so teach me the Doctrine that I
shall be relieved of this my doubt."

   Then Subhadda, the wandering ascetic, drew near to the sal-tree grove
Upavattana of the Mallas, and to where the venerable Ânanda was, and
having drawn near, he spoke to the venerable Ânanda as follows:--

   "Ânanda, I have heard wandering ascetics, that were old men, advanced
in years, teachers, and teachers' teachers, declare, 'But seldom, and on
rare occasions, does a Tathâgata, a saint, and Supreme Buddha arise in
the world.' And to-night, in the last watch, the monk Gotama will pass
into Nirvana. And a certain doubt has arisen in my mind, and I am
persuaded of the monk Gotama that he can so teach

|                                   |                                                  |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_104">p. 104</span> | <span class="small">\[MPS.57<sup>18</sup></span> |

me the Doctrine that I shall be relieved of this my doubt. Let me, then,
Ânanda, have an opportunity of seeing the monk Gotama."

   When Subhadda, the wandering ascetic, had so spoken, the venerable
Ânanda spoke to him as follows:--

   "Enough of that, brother Subhadda; trouble not The Tathâgata. The
Blessed One is weary."

   And a second time Subhadda, the wandering ascetic, . . .

   And a third time Subhadda, the wandering ascetic, spoke to the
venerable Ânanda as follows:--

   "Ânanda, I have heard wandering ascetics, old men, advanced in years,
teachers, and teachers' teachers, when they said, 'But seldom, and on
rare occasions, does a Tathâgata, a saint, and Supreme Buddha arise in
the world.' And to-night, in the last watch, the monk Gotama will pass
into Nirvana. And a certain doubt has arisen in my mind, and I am
persuaded of the monk Gotama that he can so teach me the Doctrine that I
shall be relieved of this my doubt. Let me, then, Ânanda, have an
opportunity of seeing the monk Gotama."

   And a third time the venerable Ânanda spoke to Subhadda, the
wandering ascetic, as follows:--

   "Enough of that, brother Subhadda; trouble not The Tathâgata. The
Blessed One is weary."

   Now The Blessed One chanced to hear the conversation between the
venerable Ânanda and the wandering ascetic Subhadda. And The Blessed One
called to the venerable Ânanda:--

   "Enough, Ânanda; hinder not Subhadda. Let Subhadda, Ânanda, have an
opportunity of beholding The Tathâgata. Whatever Subhadda shall ask of
me, he will ask for the sake of information, and not for the sake of
troubling me, and he will quickly understand my answers to his
questions."

   Then the venerable Ânanda spoke to Subhadda, the wandering ascetic,
as follows:--

   "You may come, brother Subhadda; The Blessed One grants you an
audience."

   Then Subhadda, the wandering ascetic, drew near to

|                                   |                                                 |
|:----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_105">p. 105</span> | <span class="small">\[MPS.58<sup>8</sup></span> |

where The Blessed One was; and having drawn near, he exchanged greetings
with The Blessed One; and having passed with him the greetings of
friendship and civility, he sat down respectfully at one side. And
seated respectfully at one side, Subhadda, the wandering ascetic, spoke
to The Blessed One as follows:--

   "Gotama, all those monks and Brahmans who possess a large following
and crowds of hearers and disciples, and who are distinguished, renowned
leaders of sects, and highly esteemed by the multitudes,--to wit, Pûrana
Kassapa, Makkhali Gosâla, Ajita Kesakambali, Pakudha Kaccâyana, Sañjaya
Belatthiputta, Nigantha Nâthaputta,--have they all done as they
maintain, discovered the truth, or have they not? or have some of them
done so, and others not?"

   "Enough, O Subhadda; let us leave the question, 'Have they all done
as they maintain, discovered the truth, or have they not? or have some
of them done so, and others not?' The Doctrine will I teach you,
Subhadda. Listen to me, and pay strict attention, and I will speak."

   "Yes, Reverend Sir," said Subhadda, the wandering ascetic, to The
Blessed One in assent. And The Blessed One spoke as follows:--

   "Subhadda, in whatever doctrine and discipline the noble eightfold
path is not found, therein also is not found the monk of the first
degree, nor the monk of the second degree, nor the monk of the third
degree, nor the monk of the fourth degree; and in whatever doctrine and
discipline, O Subhadda, the noble eightfold path is found, therein also
are found the monk of the first degree, and the monk of the second
degree, and the monk of the third degree, and the monk of the fourth
degree. Now in this Doctrine and Discipline, O Subhadda, the noble
eightfold path is found: and therein alone, O Subhadda, are found the
monk of the first degree, and the monk of the second degree, and the
monk of the third degree, and the monk of the fourth degree. Destitute
of true monks are all other creeds. But let these my priests, O
Subhadda, live rightly, and the world will not be destitute of saints.

But let these my priests, O Subhadda, live rightly, and the world will
not be destitute of saints."

   When The Blessed One had thus spoken, Subhadda, the wandering
ascetic, spoke to him as follows:--

   "O wonderful is it, Reverend Sir! O wonderful is it, Reverend Sir! It
is as if, Reverend Sir, one were to set up that which was overturned, or
were to disclose that which was hidden, or were to point out the way to
a lost traveller, or were to carry a lamp into a dark place that they
who had eyes might see forms. Even so has The Blessed One expounded the
Doctrine in many different ways. Reverend Sir, I betake myself to The
Blessed One for refuge, to the Doctrine, and to the Congregation of the
priests. Suffer me to retire from the world under The Blessed One;
suffer me to receive ordination."

   "Subhadda, any one who aforetime has been an adherent of another sect
and afterwards desires to retire from the world and receive ordination
under this Doctrine and Discipline, must first spend four months on
probation; and after the lapse of four months, strenuous-minded priests
receive him into the Order and confer on him the priestly ordination.
Nevertheless, in this matter of probation I recognize a difference in
persons."

   "Reverend Sir, if all they who aforetime have been adherents of other
sects and afterwards desire to retire from the world and receive
ordination under this Doctrine and Discipline, must first spend four
months on probation, and after the lapse of four months strenuous-minded
priests receive them into the Order, and confer on them the priestly
ordination,

|                                   |                                                  |

| <span id="page_107">p. 107</span> | <span class="small">\[MPS.59<sup>29</sup></span> |

then am I ready to spend four years on probation, and after the lapse of
four years, let strenuous-minded priests' receive me into the Order and
confer on me the priestly ordination."

   Then The Blessed One said to the venerable Ânanda,

   "Well, then, Ânanda, receive Subhadda into the Order."

   "Yes, Reverend Sir," said the venerable Ânanda to The Blessed One in
assent.

   Then Subhadda, the wandering ascetic, spoke to the venerable Ânanda
as follows:--

   "How fortunate you priests are, brother Ânanda! How supremely
fortunate, brother Ânanda, that you all have been sprinkled with the
sprinkling of discipleship at the hands of The Teacher himself."

   And Subhadda, the wandering ascetic, retired from the world under The
Blessed One, and received ordination. And without delay, after he had
received ordination, the venerable Subhadda began to live solitary and
retired, vigilant, strenuous, and zealous; and in no long time, and
while yet alive, he came to learn for himself, and to realize, and to
live in the possession of that highest good to which the holy life
conducts, and for the sake of which youths of good family so nobly
retire from the household life to the houseless one. And he knew that
for him rebirth was exhausted, that he had lived the holy life, that he
had done what it behooved him to do, and that he was no more for this
world. So the venerable Subhadda became of the number of the saints, and
he was the last disciple made by The Blessed One himself.

   Then The Blessed One addressed the venerable Ânanda:--

   "It may be, Ânanda, that some of you will think, 'The word of The
Teacher is a thing of the past; we have now no Teacher.' But that,
Ânanda, is not the correct view. The Doctrine and Discipline, Ânanda,
which I have taught and enjoined upon you is to be your teacher when I
am gone. But whereas now, Ânanda, all the priests address each other
with the title of 'brother,' not so must they address each other after I
am gone. A senior priest, Ânanda, is to address

|                                   |                                                  |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_108">p. 108</span> | <span class="small">\[MPS.60<sup>21</sup></span> |

a junior priest either by his given name, or by his family name, or by
the title of 'brother;' a junior priest is to address a senior priest
with the title 'reverend sir,' or 'venerable.' If the Order, Ânanda,
wish to do so, after I am gone they may abrogate all the lesser and
minor precepts. On Channa,<span id="page_108_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_108_note_1.md) Ânanda, after I am gone,
the higher penalty is to be inflicted."

   "Reverend Sir, what is this higher penalty?"

   "Let Channa, Ânanda, say what he likes, he is not to be spoken to nor
admonished nor instructed by the priests."

   Then The Blessed One addressed the priests:--

   "It may be, O priests, that some priest has a doubt or perplexity
respecting either The Buddha or the Doctrine or the Order or the Path or
the course of conduct. Ask any questions, O priests, and suffer not that
afterwards ye feel remorse, saying, 'Our Teacher was present with us,
but we failed to ask him all our questions.'"

   When he had so spoken, the priests remained silent.

   And a second time The Blessed One, and a third time The Blessed One
addressed the priests:--

   "It may be, O priests, that some priest has a doubt or perplexity
respecting either The Buddha or the Doctrine or the Order or the Path or
the course of conduct. Ask any question, O priests, and suffer not that
afterwards ye feel remorse, saying, 'Our Teacher was present with us,
but we failed to ask him all our questions.'"

   And a third time the priests remained silent.

   Then The Blessed One addressed the priests:--

   "It may be, O priests, that it is out of respect to The Teacher that
ye ask no questions. Then let each one speak to his friend."

   And when he had thus spoken, the priests remained silent.

   Then the venerable Ânanda spoke to The Blessed One as follows:--

   "It is wonderful, Reverend Sir! It is marvellous, Reverend

|                                   |                                                  |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_109">p. 109</span> | <span class="small">\[MPS.61<sup>15</sup></span> |

Sir! Reverend Sir, I have faith to believe that in this congregation of
priests not a single priest has a doubt or perplexity respecting either
The Buddha or the Doctrine or the Order or the Path or the course of
conduct."

   "With you, Ânanda, it is a matter of faith, when you say that; but
with The Tathâgata, Ânanda, it is a matter of knowledge that in this
congregation of priests not a single priest has a doubt or perplexity
respecting either The Buddha or the Doctrine or the Order or the Path or
the course of conduct. For of all these five hundred priests, Ânanda,
the most backward one has become converted, and is not liable to pass
into a lower state of existence, but is destined necessarily to attain
supreme wisdom."

   Then The Blessed One addressed the priests:--

   "And now, O priests, I take my leave of you; all the constituents of
being are transitory; work out your salvation with diligence."

   And this was the last word of The Tathâgata.

   Thereupon The Blessed One entered the first trance; and rising from
the first trance, he entered the second trance; and rising from the
second trance, he entered the third trance; and rising from the third
trance, he entered the fourth trance; and rising from the fourth trance,
he entered the realm of the infinity of space; and rising from the realm
of the infinity of space, he entered the realm of the infinity of
consciousness; and rising from the realm of the infinity of
consciousness, he entered the realm of nothingness; and rising from the
realm of nothingness, he entered the realm of neither perception nor yet
non-perception; and rising from the realm of neither perception nor yet
non-perception, he arrived at the cessation of perception and sensation.

   Thereupon the venerable Ânanda spoke to the venerable Anuruddha as
follows:--

   "Reverend Anuruddha, The Blessed One has passed into Nirvana."

   "Nay, brother Ânanda, The Blessed One has not passed into Nirvana; he
has arrived at the cessation of perception and sensation."

|                                   |                                                 |
|:----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_110">p. 110</span> | <span class="small">\[MPS.62<sup>1</sup></span> |

   Thereupon The Blessed One rising from the cessation of his perception
and sensation, entered the realm of neither perception nor yet
non-perception; and rising from the realm of neither perception nor yet
non-perception, he entered the realm of nothingness; and rising from the
realm of nothingness, he entered the realm of the infinity of
consciousness; and rising from the realm of the infinity of
consciousness, he entered the realm of the infinity of space; and rising
from the realm of the infinity of space, he entered the fourth trance;
and rising from the fourth trance, he entered the third trance; and
rising from the third trance, he entered the second trance; and rising
from the second trance, he entered the first trance; and rising from the
first trance, he entered the second trance; and rising from the second
trance, he entered the third trance; and rising from the third trance,
he entered the fourth trance; and rising from the fourth trance,
immediately The Blessed One passed into Nirvana.

like that of its Jaina equivalent *Tatthagaya*, possibly is, "He who has
arrived there (*tatra* or *tattha*), *i.e.* to emancipation *or*
Nirvana." See "Sacred Books of the East," [vol. xiii. p.
