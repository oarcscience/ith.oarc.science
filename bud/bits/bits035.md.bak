§ 35. EXISTENCE.

<span class="small">Translated from the Visuddhi-Magga (chap.
xvii.).</span>

   In the proposition, *On attachment depends existence*,

   "Existence" is so called because it is an existing. It is twofold;
karma-existence, and originating-existence. As it has been said:
"Existence is twofold: there is a karma-existence, and there is an
originating-existence." Here karma-existence is equivalent to karma; and
in like manner originating-existence is equivalent to originating.
Originating is called existence because it is an existing; but karma is
called existence because it causes existence, just as the birth of a
Buddha is called happy because it results in happiness.

   This, then, is the full understanding of *the sense*.

|                                   |                                       |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_195">p. 195</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xvii</span> |

   *The different elements*:--Karma-existence is in brief thought and
the elements covetousness etc., which go under the name of karma and
exist conjoined with thought. As it has been said,

   "What is karma-existence? Meritorious karma, demeritorious karma, and
karma leading to immovability, all these are called karma-existence,
whether they be of little or great extent. Moreover all karma conducive
to existence is karma-existence."

   In the above, the term meritorious karma includes thirteen thoughts,
demeritorious karma includes twelve, and the term, karma leading to
immovability, includes four thoughts. Also, by the phrase, "Whether of
little or great extent," is meant the slight or large amount of fruition
of these same thoughts, and, by the phrase, "And all karma conducive to
existence," are meant covetousness and so on conjoined with thought.

   Originating-existence, however, is in brief the groups which have
come into existence through karma, and it has a ninefold division. As it
is said,

   "What is originating-existence? Existence in the realm of sensual
pleasure, existence in the realm of form, existence in the realm of
formlessness, existence in the realm of perception, existence in the
realm of non-perception, existence in the realm of neither perception
nor yet non-perception, existence once infected, existence four times
infected, existence five times infected, all these are
originating-existence."

   In the above, existence in the realm of sensual pleasure is the
existence called sensual pleasure, and similarly in respect of existence
in the realm of form, and of existence in the realm of formlessness.
Existence in the realm of perception is so called either because
perception constitutes that existence, or because there is perception in
that existence. The converse is the case with existence in the realm of
non-perception. Existence in the realm of neither perception nor yet
non-perception is so called because, as there is no gross perception
there, but only a subtile one, there is neither perception nor yet
non-perception in that existence. Existence

|                                   |                                       |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_196">p. 196</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xvii</span> |

once infected is existence infected with the form-group alone, or it is
called existence once infected because there is but one infection to
that existence, and similarly in regard to existences four times and
five times infected.

   Existence in the realm of sensual pleasure is the five
attachment-groups, and existence in the realm of form is the same.
Existence in the realm of formlessness is four attachment-groups.
Existence in the realm of perception is five attachment-groups, and
existence in the realm of non-perception is one attachment-group.
Existence in the realm of neither perception nor yet non-perception is
four attachment-groups, and existence once infected etc., is one, four,
or five attachment-groups.

   This, then, is the full understanding of *the different elements*.

   *The use*:--It is true that the meritorious and the other karmas have
been already spoken of in the exposition of karma. However, this karma
was the karma of a previous existence and hence given as constituting
the dependence for conception into this one,--while in the present case
they are present karma and given as constituting the dependence for
conception into a future existence. Thus the repetition is of use. Or
again, when it was said, "What is meritorious karma? It is meritorious
thoughts in the realm of sensual pleasure," and so on, only thoughts
were included in the term karma, while in the present instance where it
is said, "And all karma conducive to existence," there are also included
the elements of being which are conjoined with thoughts. Or again, only
that karma which is the dependence of consciousness was in the first
instance intended by the term karma, but now that also which gives rise
to an existence in the realm of non-perception. But why make a long
story of it? By the meritorious karma etc. intended in the proposition,
"On ignorance depends karma," meritorious and demeritorious factors of
being only are meant; but in the present case, in the proposition, "On
attachment depends existence," inasmuch as originating-existence is
included, all elements of being, whether meritorious or demeritorious or

|                                   |                                       |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_197">p. 197</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xvii</span> |

indeterminate are intended. Accordingly the repetition is useful from
every point of view.

   This, then, is the full understanding of *the use*.

   *Divisions. summings up*:--The divisions and summings up of an
existence dependent on attachment. For, whatever karma depends on the
attachment of sensual pleasure and produces existence in the realm of
sensual pleasure, this is karma-existence; and the groups that spring
from it are originating-existence. Similarly in regard to existence in
the realm of form and existence in the realm of formlessness. This makes
two existences in the realm of sensual pleasure besides the therewith
included existence in the realm of perception and existence five times
infected; two existences in the realm of form besides the therewith
included existence in the realm of perception, existence in the realm of
non-perception, existence once infected, and existence five times
infected; and two existences in the realm of formlessness besides the
therewith included existence in the realm of perception, existence in
the realm of neither perception nor yet non-perception, and existence
four times infected, all of which depend on the attachment of sensual
pleasure--six existences besides the therewith included existences. And
just as six existences and the therewith included existences depend on
the attachment of sensual pleasure, so also do six existences depend on
each of the other three attachments. Thus in respect of their divisions
there are twenty-four existences besides the therewith included
existences, all of which depend on attachment.

   In regard to their summings up, however, by putting karma-existence
and originating-existence together we have existence in the realm of
sensual pleasure and the therewith included existences, existence in the
realm of form, and existence in the realm of formlessness, making three
existences which depend on the attachment of sensual pleasure; and
similarly in regard to the remaining attachments. Thus there sum up
twelve existences besides the therewith included existences, all of
which depend on attachment. Moreover, to speak absolutely,
karma-existence is karma which leads to

|                                   |                                       |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_198">p. 198</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xvii</span> |

existence in the realm of sensual pleasure and is dependent on
attachment, and the groups which spring from it are
originating-existence. And it is the same in regard to existence in the
realm of form and existence in the realm of formlessness. This makes two
existences in the realm of sensual pleasure, two existences in the realm
of form, and two existences in the realm of formlessness besides the
therewith included existences, all of which depend on attachment. By
another method of computation, the six existences, by not dividing into
karma-existence and originating-existence, sum up as three existences,
namely, existence in the realm of sensual pleasure etc., besides the
existences therewith included. Also by not dividing into existence in
the realm of sensual pleasure ere., karma-existence and
originating-existence become two existences; and again, by not dividing
into karma. existence and originating-existence, there remains in the
proposition, "On attachment depends existence," only existence.

   This, then, is the full understanding of *the divisions* and summings
up of existence dependent on attachment.

   *And which the dependence makes of which*:--The sense is, it must be
fully understood which attachment is the dependence of which? But which
is the dependence of which? Every one is the dependence of everyone
else. For the unconverted are like madmen, and fail to reflect on what
is suitable and what is unsuitable. As the result of any and every
attachment, they long for any and every existence and perform any and
every karma. Therefore the view of those who say that existence in the
realm of form and existence in the realm of formlessness do not come
about by the attachment of fanatical conduct is not to be accepted. But
on the contrary, any and every existence comes about by any and every
attachment. As follows:--

   We may have one who, because of what he hears reported or by
inference from what he sees, reflects as follows: "Sensual pleasures
obtain in the world of men in wealthy families of the warrior caste and
so forth and so on, and also in the six heavens of sensual pleasures."
Then he becomes deceived

|                                   |                                       |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_199">p. 199</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xvii</span> |

by listening to false doctrine and takes a wrong way to attain them, and
thinking, "By this kind of karma I shall obtain sensual pleasures," he
adopts the attachment of sensual pleasure and does evil with his body,
evil with his voice, and evil with his mind, and when he has fulfilled
his wickedness he is reborn in a lower state of existence. Or again, he
adopts the attachment of sensual pleasure through being desirous of
sensual pleasure and of protecting that which he has already obtained,
and does evil with his body, evil with his voice, and evil with his
mind, and when he has fulfilled his wickedness he is reborn in a lower
state of existence. Here the karma that was the cause of his rebirth is
karma-existence. The groups which sprang from that karma were
originating-existence. Existence in the realm of perception and
existence five times infected are therewith included.

   Another, however, strengthens his knowledge by listening to the Good
Doctrine, and thinking, "By this kind of karma I shall obtain sensual
pleasures," adopts the attachment of sensual pleasure and does good with
his body, good with his voice, and good with his mind; and when he has
fulfilled his righteousness he is reborn either among the gods or among
men. Here the karma that was the cause of his rebirth is
karma-existence. The groups which sprang from that karma were
originating-existence. Existence in the realm of form and existence five
times infected are therewith included. Accordingly the attachment of
sensual pleasure is the dependence of existence in the realm of sensual
pleasure together with its divisions and whatever existences are
therewith included.

   Another, having heard or come to the conclusion that there are
superior sensual pleasures in the realm of form and in the realm of
formlessness, adopts the attachment of sensual pleasure and achieves the
trances of the realm of form and of the realm of formlessness, and by
the might of these trances is reborn in a Brahma-heaven. Here the karma
that was the cause of his rebirth was karma-existence. The groups which
sprang from that karma were originating-existence. Existence in the
realm of perception, existence in the

|                                   |                                       |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_200">p. 200</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xvii</span> |

realm of non-perception, existence in the realm of neither perception
nor yet non-perception, existence once infected, and existence five
times infected, are therewith included. Accordingly the attachment of
sensual pleasure is the dependence of existence in the realm of form and
existence in the realm of formlessness, together with their divisions
and the existences therewith included.

   Another adopts the heresy of the annihilation of existences and
thinking either that it would be a good plan to have his Ego undergo
annihilation while in the realm of sensual pleasure or else while in the
realm of form or else while in the realm of formlessness, performs karma
leading to those existences. This karma of his is karma-existence and
the groups that spring from it are originating-existence. Existence in
the realm of perception etc. are therewith included. Accordingly the
attachment of heresy is the dependence of all three modes of existence,
viz., of existence in the realm of sensual pleasure, existence in the
realm of form, and existence in the realm of formlessness, together with
their divisions and the existences therewith included.

   Another, thinking either that his Ego is happy when in the realm of
sensual pleasure, or else when in the realm of form, or else when in the
realm of formlessness, by the attachment of the assertion of an Ego
performs karma leading to those existences. This karma of his is
karma-existence and the groups that spring from it are
originating-existence. Existence in the realm of perception etc. are
therewith included. Accordingly the attachment of the assertion of an
Ego is the dependence for the three modes of existence together with
their divisions and the existences therewith included.

   Another, thinking that fanatical conduct attains to a happy
fulfilment either in the realm of sensual pleasure, or else in the realm
of form, or else in the realm of formlessness, adopts the attachment of
fanatical conduct and performs the karma leading to those existences.
This karma of his is karma-existence and the groups that spring from it
are originating-existence. Existence in the realm of perception

|                                   |                                       |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_201">p. 201</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xvii</span> |

etc. are therewith included. Accordingly the attachment of fanatical
conduct is the dependence for the three modes of existence together with
their divisions and the existences therewith included.

   This, then, is the full understanding of *and which the dependence
makes of which*.

   Now if it be asked, "But how is which the dependence of which
existence?" we answer that attachment is to be understood as the
proximate dependence of existence in the realm of form and in the realm
of formlessness, and the connate etc. dependence of existence in the
realm of sensual pleasure.

   For when a being is in the realm of sensual pleasure, then the four
attachments are the dependence of meritorious karma and of
originating-existence in the realm of form and in the realm of
formlessness by the proximate dependence alone. When conjoined with
demeritorious karma they are the dependence by the connate dependence
etc., that is, by the connate, the mutual, the basal, the conjoined, the
actual, the abiding, and the causal dependence; but when not so
conjoined, by the proximate dependence alone. This is the full
discussion of the proposition "On attachment depends existence."
