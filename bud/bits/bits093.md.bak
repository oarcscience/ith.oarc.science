§ 93. THE ANGER-EATING DEMON.

<span class="small">Translated from the Samyutta-Nikâya
(xi.3.2<sup>1</sup>).</span>

   Thus have I heard.

   On a certain occasion The Blessed One was dwelling at Sâvatthi in
Jetavana monastery in Anâthapindika's Park. And there The Blessed One
addressed the priests:

   "Priests!" said he.

   "Lord!" said the priests in reply.

   And The Blessed One spoke as follows:

   Once upon a time, O priests, a certain sickly-looking and decrepit
demon took his seat on the throne of Sakka, the leader of the gods. And
the Gods, O priests, of the Suite of the Thirty-three, were angered,
annoyed, and spoke indignantly: "O wonderful is it! O marvellous is it!
Here this sickly-looking and decrepit demon has taken his seat on the
throne of Sakka, the leader of the gods!" Now, O priests, in proportion
as the Gods of the Suite of the Thirty-three were angered, annoyed, and
spoke indignantly, in the same proportion did the demon grow handsomer,
better-looking, and more pleasing.

   Then, O priests, the Gods of the Suite of the Thirty-three drew near
to where Sakka, the leader of the gods, was; and having drawn near, they
spoke to Sakka, the leader of the gods, as follows:

|                                   |                                                   |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_427">p. 427</span> | <span class="small">\[S.xi.3.2<sup>7</sup></span> |

   "Sir, a certain sickly-looking and decrepit demon has come here and
taken his seat on your throne. And the Gods, sir, of the Suite of the
Thirty-three, are angered, annoyed, and speak indignantly: 'O wonderful
is it! O marvellous is it! Here this sickly-looking and decrepit demon
has taken his seat on the throne of Sakka, the leader of the gods.' And,
sir, in proportion as the Gods of the Suite of the Thirty-three are
angered, annoyed, and speak indignantly, in the same proportion does the
demon grow handsomer, better-looking, and more pleasing. Sir, surely
now, it must be an anger-eating demon."

   Then, O priests, Sakka, the leader of the gods, drew near to where
the anger-eating demon was; and having drawn near, he threw his upper
garment over his shoulder, and planting his right knee-pan on the
ground, he stretched out his joined palms to the demon, and thrice
announced himself:

   "Sir, your obedient servant, Sakka, the leader of the gods! Sir, your
obedient servant, Sakka, the leader of the gods! Sir, your obedient
servant, Sakka, the leader of the gods!"

   And the more, O priests, Sakka, the leader of the gods, proclaimed
his own name, the more sickly-looking and decrepit became the demon; and
straightway he disappeared. Then, O priests, Sakka, the leader of the
gods, resumed his seat on his throne, and took occasion to induce in the
gods a more fitting frame of mind, by means of the following stanzas:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"My mind's not easily cast down,<br />
Nor lightly swerveth from its course;<br />
Long angry can I never be,<br />
For anger finds in me no place.<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even" data-valign="top">
<td>"I ne'er in anger say harsh words,<br />
And ne'er proclaim my virtue's fame;<br />
Myself I seek to keep subdued<br />
In interest of my future weal."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
