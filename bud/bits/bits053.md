   "*While eagerly man culls life's flowers*." This doctrinal
instruction was given by The Teacher while dwelling at Sâvatthi, and it
was concerning a woman called Husband-honorer. The affair began in the
Heaven of the Suite of the Thirty-three.

   They say that a god of that heaven named Garland-wearer went to his
pleasure-grounds in company with a thousand celestial nymphs. Five
hundred of these goddesses ascended trees and threw down flowers, while
five hundred picked up the flowers that were thrown down and decked the
god therewith. One of these goddesses, while on the bough of a tree,
fell from that existence, her body vanishing like the flame of a lamp.

   Then she was conceived in a high-caste family of Sâvatthi, and was
born with a reminiscence of her previous existences. And saying to
herself, "I am the wife of the god Garland-wearer," she made offerings
of perfumes, garlands, and the like, with the prayer that in her next
rebirth she might again be with her husband. And when at the age of
sixteen years she married into another family, with ticket-food, and
fortnightly food, she continued to give alms, saying, "May this prove
efficacious in bringing about my rebirth with my husband."

   Thereupon the priests gave her the name of Husband-honorer, for they
said: "She works early and late, and her only desire is for her
husband."

   Husband-honorer continually took care of the hall where the priests
sat. She brought forward the drinking water,

|                                   |                                                   |

| <span id="page_265">p. 265</span> | <span class="small">\[Dhp.226<sup>13</sup></span> |

and spread out the mats to sit on. And when other people were desirous
of giving ticket-food and other alms, they would bring it to her, and
say, "Dear lady, prepare this for the congregation of the priests." And
by going to and fro in this manner, she acquired the fifty-six salutary
qualities, all at one time.

   Then she conceived, and at the end of ten lunar months she brought
forth a son; and when he was old enough to walk, another, until she had
four sons.

   One day, after she had given alms and offerings, and had listened to
the Doctrine, and kept the precepts, she died toward night-fall from a
sudden disease, and was reborn into the presence of her husband.

   The other goddesses had continued to deck the god throughout the
whole interval.

   "We have not seen you since morning," said the god.

   "Where have you been?"

   "I fell from this existence, my lord."

   "Are you in earnest?"

   "It was precisely so, my lord."

   "Where were you born?"

   "At Sâvatthi, in a family of high caste."

   "How long were you there?"

   "My lord, at the end of ten months I issued from my mother's womb,
and at the age of sixteen years I married into another family; and
having borne four sons, and having given gifts and done other
meritorious deeds with the prayer that I might again be with you, I have
been born into your presence."

   "How long is the life of men?"

   "Only a hundred years."

   "Is that all?"

   "Yes, my lord."

   "If that is the length of life to which men are born, pray, now, do
they pass the time asleep and reckless, or do they give gifts and do
other meritorious deeds?"

   "Nothing of the kind, my lord. Men are always reckless, as if they
were born to a life of an incalculable number of years, and were never
to grow old and die."

|                                   |                                                  |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|

   At this the god Garland-wearer became exceedingly agitated.

   "Men, it appears, are born to a life of only one hundred years, yet
they recklessly lie down and sleep away their time. When will they ever
get free from misery?"

   A hundred of our years make one day and night of the Gods of the
Suite of the Thirty-three; thirty such days and nights their month; and
twelve such months their year. And the length of their lives is a
thousand such celestial years, or in human notation thirty-six million
years. Thus for that god not one day has passed; but like a moment had
the interval seemed to him. And thus he thought, "Recklessness for
short-lived men is extremely unsuitable."

   On the next day, when the priests entered the village, they found the
hall had not been looked after; the mats had not been spread, and the
drinking water had not been placed. Then they inquired,

   "Where is Husband-honorer?"

   "Reverend sirs, how could you expect to see her? Yesterday, after
your worships had eaten and departed, she died at even-tide."

   When the priests heard this, the unconverted among them, calling to
mind her benefactions, were unable to restrain their tears, while those
in whom depravity had come to an end had their elements of being
agitated. After breakfast they returned to the monastery, and made
inquiry of The Teacher:

   "Reverend Sir, Husband-honorer worked early and late doing many kinds
of meritorious deeds, and prayed only for her husband. Now she is dead.
Where, pray, has she been reborn?"

   "With her husband, O priests."

   "But, Reverend Sir, she is not with her husband."

   "O priests, it was not this husband she was praying for. She had a
husband named Garland-wearer, a God of the Suite of the Thirty-three,
and fell from that existence while he was decorating himself with
flowers. Now she has returned and been born again at his side."

|                                   |                                                   |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_267">p. 267</span> | <span class="small">\[Dhp.227<sup>27</sup></span> |

   "Reverend Sir, is it really so?"

   "Assuredly, O priests."

   "Alas, Reverend Sir, how very short is the life of all creatures! In
the morning she waited on us, and in the evening a disease attacked her,
and she died."

   "Assuredly, O priests," said The Teacher, "the life of creatures is
indeed short. And thus it is that death gets creatures into his power,
and drags them away howling and weeping, and still unsated in their
senses and lusts."

   So saying, he pronounced the following stanza:

<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
