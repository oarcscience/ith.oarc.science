§ 71. THE SUMMUM BONUM.

{Ariyapariyesana Sutta}

<span class="small">Translated from the Majjhima-Nikâya, and
constituting Sutta 26.</span>

   Thus have I heard.

   On a certain occasion The Blessed One was dwelling at Sâvatthi in
Jetavana monastery in Anâthapindika's Park. Then The Blessed One, having
put on his tunic in the morning, and taken his bowl and his robes,
entered Sâvatthi for alms.

   Then a great number of priests drew near to where the venerable
Ânanda was; and having drawn near, they spoke to the venerable Ânanda as
follows:

   "It is a long time, brother Ânanda, since we listened to a doctrinal
discourse from the mouth of The Blessed One. Come, brother Ânanda, let
us obtain an opportunity to listen to a doctrinal discourse from the
mouth of The Blessed One."

   "Well, then, venerable sirs, draw near to the monastery of Rammaka
the Brahman. Perchance you may obtain an opportunity to listen to a
doctrinal discourse from the mouth of The Blessed One."

   "Yes, brother," said the priests to the venerable Ânanda in assent.

   Then The Blessed One, when he had gone the rounds for alms in
Sâvatthi, returned from his begging, and after breakfast, addressed the
venerable Ânanda:

   "Let us go hence, Ânanda, and to Eastern Monastery, and to the
storied mansion of Migâra's mother will we draw near for our noon-day
rest."

   "Yes, Reverend Sir," said the venerable Ânanda to The Blessed One in
assent.

   Then The Blessed One, in company with the venerable Ânanda, drew near
to Eastern Monastery, and to the storied mansion of Migâra's mother, for
his noon-day rest. Then The Blessed One, in the afternoon, rose from
meditation, and addressed the venerable Ânanda:

|                                   |                                                  |

| <span id="page_332">p. 332</span> | <span class="small">\[M.i.161<sup>4</sup></span> |

   "Let us go hence, Ânanda, and to Eastern Tank will we draw near to
bathe our limbs."

   "Yes, Reverend Sir," said the venerable Ânanda to The Blessed One in
assent.

   Then The Blessed One, in company with the venerable Ânanda, drew near
to Eastern Tank to bathe his limbs; and having bathed his limbs in
Eastern Tank and come up out of the water, he stood with but a single
garment on, drying his limbs.

   Then the venerable Ânanda spoke to The Blessed One as follows:

   "Reverend Sir, here is the monastery of Rammaka the Brahman, but a
short way off. Delightful, Reverend Sir, is the monastery of Rammaka the
Brahman; enchanting, Reverend Sir, is the monastery of Rammaka the
Brahman. Reverend Sir, pray let The Blessed One be so kind as to draw
near to where the monastery of Rammaka the Brahman is." And The Blessed
One consented by his silence.

   Then The Blessed One drew near to where the monastery of Rammaka the
Brahman was. Now at that time a great number of priests were seated in
the monastery of Rammaka the Brahman, engaged in doctrinal discourse.
Then The Blessed One stood outside in the entrance porch, and awaited
the end of the discourse. Then The Blessed One, when he perceived that
the discourse had come to an end, coughed, and rattled the bolt of the
door. And the priests opened the door for The Blessed One. Then The
Blessed One entered the monastery of Rammaka the Brahman, and sat on the
seat that was spread for him. And when The Blessed One had sat down, he
addressed the priests:

   "What, O priests, was the subject of the present meeting? and what
the discourse you were holding?"

   "Reverend Sir, our doctrinal discourse was concerning The Blessed
One, and then The Blessed One arrived."

   "Well said, O priests! This, O priests, is worthy of you as youths of
good family, who have through faith retired from the household life to
the houseless one, that ye sit together in doctrinal discourse. O
priests, one of two things

|                                   |                                                   |

| <span id="page_333">p. 333</span> | <span class="small">\[M.i.161<sup>32</sup></span> |

should you do when you meet together: either hold a doctrinal discourse,
or maintain a noble silence.

   "There are two cravings, O priests; the noble one, and the ignoble
one. And what, O priests, is the ignoble craving?

   "We may have, O priests, the case of one who, himself subject to
birth, craves what is subject to birth; himself subject to old age,
craves what is subject to old age; himself subject to disease, . . .
death, . . . sorrow, . . . corruption, craves what is subject to
corruption.

   "And what, O priests, should one consider as subject to birth?

   "Wife and child, O priests, are subject to birth; slaves, male and
female, . . . goats and sheep . . . fowls and pigs . . . elephants,
cattle, horses and mares . . . gold and silver are subject to birth. All
the substrata of being, O priests, are subject to birth; and enveloped,
besotted, and immersed in them, this person, himself subject to birth,
craves what is subject to birth.

   "And what, O priests, should one consider as subject to old age . . .
disease . . . death . . . sorrow . . . corruption?

   "Wife and child, O priests, are subject to corruption; slaves, male
and female, . . . goats and sheep . . . fowls and pigs . . . elephants,
cattle, horses and mares . . . gold and silver are subject to
corruption. All the substrata of being, O priests, are subject to
corruption; and enveloped, besotted, and immersed in them, this person,
himself subject to corruption, craves what is subject to corruption.

   "This, O priests, is the ignoble craving.

   "And what, O priests, is the noble craving?

   "We may have, O priests, the case of one who, himself subject to
birth, perceives the wretchedness of what is subject to birth, and
craves the incomparable security of a Nirvana free from birth; himself
subject to old age, . . . disease, . . . death, . . . sorrow, . . .
corruption, perceives the wretchedness of what is subject to corruption,
and craves the incomparable security of a Nirvana free from corruption.

   "This, O priests, is the noble craving.

|                                   |                                                  |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_334">p. 334</span> | <span class="small">\[M.i.163<sup>9</sup></span> |

   "Now I, O priests, before my Buddhaship, being not yet a Buddha, but
a Future Buddha, myself subject to birth, craved what was subject to
birth; myself subject to old age, . . . disease, . . . death, . . .
sorrow, . . . corruption, craved what was subject to corruption. And it
occurred to me, O priests, as follows:

   "'Why, myself subject to birth, do I crave what is subject to birth?
myself subject to old age, . . . disease, . . . death, . . . sorrow, . .
. corruption, do I crave what is subject to corruption? What if now,
myself subject to birth, and perceiving the wretchedness of what is
subject to birth, I were to crave the incomparable security of a Nirvana
free from birth; myself subject to old age, . . . disease, . . . death,
. . . sorrow, . . . corruption, I were to crave the incomparable
security of a Nirvana free from corruption?'

   "Subsequently, O priests, although of tender age, with the black hair
of a lad, and in the hey-day of my youth, and just entering on my prime,
and although my mother and my father were unwilling, and tears streamed
from their eyes, I had my hair and my beard shaved off, and put on
yellow garments, and retired from the household life to the houseless
one. And having thus retired from the world, and craving the summum
bonum, the incomparable peaceful state, I drew near to where Âlâra
Kâlâma was; and having drawn near, I spoke to Âlâra Kâlâma as follows:

   "'Brother Kâlâma, I would like to lead the religious life under your
doctrine and discipline.'

   "When I had thus spoken, O priests, Âlâra Kâlâma spoke to me as
follows:

   "'Let your venerable worship do so. Such is this doctrine that in no
long time an intelligent man can learn for himself, realize, and live in
the possession of all that his master has to teach.'

   "Then I, O priests, in no long time, quickly acquired that doctrine.
And I, O priests, and others with me, by a mere lip-profession, and a
mere verbal assertion, claimed that we knew and had perceived the true
knowledge and the orthodox doctrine. And it occurred to me, O priests,
as follows:

|                                   |                                                  |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_335">p. 335</span> | <span class="small">\[M.i.164<sup>7</sup></span> |

   "'It is not through mere faith in this doctrine that Âlâra Kâlâma
announces that he has learnt it for himself, realized it, and lives in
the possession of it. Âlâra Kâlâma surely knows and perceives this
doctrine.'

   "Then, O priests, I drew near to where Âlâra Kâlâma was; and having
drawn near, I spoke to Âlâra Kâlâma as follows:

   "'Brother Kâlâma, how far does this doctrine conduct, concerning
which you announce that you have learnt it for yourself, realized it,
and entered upon it?'

   "When I had thus spoken, O priests, Âlâra Kâlâma announced that it
conducted to the realm of nothingness. And it occurred to me, O priests,
as follows:

   "'Faith is not peculiar to Âlâra Kâlâma: I also have faith. Heroism .
. . contemplation . . . concentration . . . wisdom is not peculiar to
Âlâra Kâlâma: I also have wisdom. What if now I were to strive for the
realization of that doctrine, concerning which Âlâra Kâlâma announces
that he has learnt it for himself, realized it, and lives in the
possession of it.' Then I, O priests, in no long time, quickly learnt
that doctrine for myself, realized it, and lived in the possession of
it. Then, O priests, I drew near to where Âlâra Kâlâma was; and having
drawn near, I spoke to Âlâra Kâlâma as follows:

   "'Brother Kâlâma, is this as far as the doctrine conducts, concerning
which you announce that you have learnt it for yourself, realized it,
and entered upon it?'

   "'This, brother, is as far as the doctrine conducts, concerning which
I announce that I have learnt it for myself, realized it, and entered
upon it.'

   "'I also, brother, have learnt this doctrine for myself, realized it,
and live in the possession of it.'

   "'How fortunate, brother, are we! What supreme good fortune, brother,
is ours that we should light on such a co-religionist as is your
venerable worship. Thus the doctrine concerning which I announce that I
have learnt it for myself, realized it, and entered upon it, that
doctrine you have learnt for yourself, realized, and live in the
possession of; the doctrine which you have learnt for yourself,
realized, and live in

|                                   |                                                  |

the possession of, concerning that doctrine I announce that I have
learnt it for myself, realized it, and entered upon it. Thus you know
this doctrine, and I know this doctrine. You are the same as I am, and I
am the same as you are. Come, brother, let us lead this following in
common.'

   "Thus, O priests, did Âlâra Kâlâma, my teacher, take me, his pupil,
and make me every whit the equal of himself, and honor me with very
great honor. And it occurred to me, O priests, as follows:

   "'This doctrine does not lead to aversion, absence of passion,
cessation, quiescence, knowledge, supreme wisdom, and Nirvana, but only
as far as the realm of nothingness.'

   "And I, O priests, did not honor that doctrine with my adhesion, and
being averse to that doctrine, I departed on my journey.

   "And craving, O priests, the summum bonum, the incomparable peaceful
state, I drew near to where Uddaka, the disciple of Râma, was; and
having drawn near, I spoke to Uddaka, the disciple of Râma, as follows:

   "'Brother, I would like to lead the religious life under your
doctrine and discipline.'

   "When I had thus spoken, O priests, Uddaka, the disciple of Râma,
spoke to me as follows:

   "'Let your venerable worship do so. Such is this doctrine that in no

of Râma, was; and having drawn near, I spoke to Uddaka, the disciple of
Râma, as follows:

   "'Brother, how far does this doctrine conduct, concerning which Râma
made known that he had learnt it for himself, realized it, and entered
upon it?'

   "When I had thus spoken, O priests, Uddaka, the disciple of Râma,
announced that it conducted to the realm of neither perception nor yet
non-perception. And it occurred to me, O priests, as follows:

   "'Faith is not peculiar to Râma: I also have faith. Heroism . . .
contemplation . . . concentration . . . wisdom is not peculiar to Râma:
I also have wisdom. What if now I were to strive for that doctrine,
concerning which Râma announced that he had learnt it for himself,

lived in the possession of it. Then, O priests, I drew near to where
Uddaka, the disciple of Râma, was; and having drawn near, I spoke to
Uddaka, the disciple of Râma, as follows:

   "'Brother, is this as far as the doctrine conducts, concerning which
Râma announced that he had learnt it for himself, realized it, and

   "'This, brother, is as far as the doctrine conducts, concerning which
Râma announced that he had learnt it for himself, realized, and entered

announced that he had learnt it for himself, realized it, and entered

are the same as Râma was, and

| <span id="page_338">p. 338</span> | <span class="small">\[M.i.166<sup>25</sup></span> |

Râma was the same as you are. Come, brother, lead this following.'

   "Thus, O priests, did Uddaka, the disciple of Râma, my
co-religionist, make me his teacher, and honor me with very great honor.
And it occurred to me, O priests, as follows:

   "'This doctrine does not lead to aversion, absence of passion,
cessation, quiescence, knowledge, supreme wisdom, and Nirvana, but only
as far as the realm of neither perception nor yet non-perception.'

   "And I, O priests, did not honor that doctrine with my adhesion; and
being averse to that doctrine, I departed on my journey.

   "And craving, O priests, the summum bonum, the incomparable peaceful
state, I came in the course of my journeyings among the Magadhans to
Uruvelâ the General's Town. There I perceived a delightful spot with an
enchanting grove of trees, and a silvery flowing river, easy of approach
and i delightful, and a village near by in which to beg. And it occurred
to me, O priests, as follows:

   "'Truly, delightful is this spot, enchanting this grove of trees, and
this silvery river flows by, easy of approach and delightful, and there
is a village near by in which to beg. Truly, there is here everything
necessary for a youth of good family who is desirous of struggling.'

   "And there I settled down, O priests, as everything was suitable for
struggling.

   "And being, O priests, myself subject to birth, I perceived the
wretchedness of what is subject to birth, and craving the incomparable
security of a Nirvana free from birth, I attained the incomparable
security of a Nirvana free from birth; myself subject to old age, . . .
disease, . . . death, . . . sorrow, . . . corruption, I perceived the
wretchedness of what is subject to corruption, and craving the
incomparable security of a Nirvana free from corruption, I attained the
incomparable security of a Nirvana free from corruption. And the
knowledge and the insight sprang up within me, 'My deliverance is
unshakable; this is my last existence; no more shall I be born again.'
And it occurred to me, O priests, as follows:

|                                   |                                                   |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_339">p. 339</span> | <span class="small">\[M.i.167<sup>31</sup></span> |

   "'This doctrine to which I have attained is profound, recondite, and
difficult of comprehension, good, excellent, and not to be reached by
mere reasoning, subtile, and intelligible only to the wise. Mankind, on
the other hand, is captivated, entranced, held spell-bound by its lusts;
and forasmuch as mankind is captivated, entranced, and held spell-bound
by its lusts, it is hard for them to understand the law of dependence on
assignable reasons, the doctrine of Dependent Origination, and it is
also hard for them to understand how all the constituents of being may
be made to subside, all the substrata of being be relinquished, and
desire be made to vanish, and absence of passion, cessation, and Nirvana
be attained. If I were to teach the Doctrine, others would fail to
understand me, and my vexation and trouble would be great.'

   "Then, O priests, the following stanzas occurred to me, not heard of
before from any one else:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>

<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">

   "Thus, O priests, did I ponder, and my mind was disinclined to
action, and to any proclaiming of the Doctrine.

   "Then, O priests, Brahma Sahampati perceived what was in my mind, and
it occurred to him as follows:

   "'Lo, the world is lost, is ruined! For the mind of The Tathâgata,
The Saint, The Supreme Buddha, is disinclined to action, and to any
proclaiming of the Doctrine.'

   "Then, O priests, Brahma Sahampati, as quickly as a strong man might
stretch out his bent arm, or might draw in his outstretched arm, even
so, having vanished from the Brahma-world, appeared in my presence.

   "Then, O priests, Brahma Sahampati threw his upper

garment over his shoulder and, stretching out to me his joined palms,
spoke as follows:

   "'Reverend Sir, let The Blessed One teach the Doctrine, let The Happy
One teach the Doctrine. There are some beings having but little moral
defilement, and through not hearing the Doctrine they perish. Some will
be found to understand the Doctrine.'

   "Thus, O priests, spoke Brahma Sahampati, and having thus spoken, he
continued as follows:

   "Then I, O priests, perceiving the desire of Brahma, and having
compassion on living beings, gazed over the world with the eye of a
Buddha. And as I gazed over the world with the eye of a Buddha, I saw
people of every variety: some having but little moral defilement, and
some having great moral defilement; some of keen faculties, and some of
dull faculties; some of good disposition, and some of bad disposition;
some that were docile, and some that were not docile; and also some who
saw the terrors of the hereafter and of blameworthy actions. Just as in
a pond of blue lotuses, of water-roses, or of white lotuses, some of the
blossoms which have sprung up and grown in the water, do not

reach the surface of the water but grow under water; some of the
blossoms which have sprung up and grown in the water, are even with the
surface of the water; and some of the blossoms which have sprung up and
grown in the water, shoot up above the water and are not touched by the
water; in exactly the same way, O priests, as I gazed over the world
with the eye of a Buddha, I saw people of every variety: some having but
little moral defilement, and some having great moral defilement; some of
keen faculties, and some of dull faculties; some of good disposition,
and some of bad disposition; some that were docile, and some that were
not docile; and also some who saw the terrors of the hereafter and of
blameworthy actions. And when I had seen this, O priests, I addressed
Brahma Sahampati in the following stanza:

</colgroup>

   "Then, O priests, thought Brahma Sahampati, 'The Blessed One has
granted my request that he should teach the Doctrine,' and saluting me,
he turned his right side towards me, and straightway disappeared.

   "Then, O priests, it occurred to me as follows:

   "'To whom had I best teach the Doctrine first? Who would quickly
comprehend this Doctrine?'

   "Then, O priests, it occurred to me as follows:

   "'Here is this Âlâra Kâlâma, who is learned, skilled, intelligent,
and has long been a person having but little defilement. What if I teach
the Doctrine to Âlâra Kâlâma first? He would quickly comprehend this
Doctrine.'

   "Then, O priests, a deity announced to me,

   "'Reverend Sir, Âlâra Kâlâma is dead these seven days.'

   "Also in me the knowledge sprang up, 'Âlâra Kâlâma is dead these
seven days.'

   "Then, O priests, it occurred to me as follows:

have heard this Doctrine, he would quickly have comprehended it.'

   "Then, O priests, it occurred to me as follows:

   "'To whom had I best teach the Doctrine first? Who would quickly
comprehend this Doctrine?'

   "Then, O priests, it occurred to me as follows:

   "'Here is this Uddaka, the disciple of Râma, who is learned, skilled,
intelligent, and has long been a person having but little defilement.
What if I teach the Doctrine to Uddaka, the disciple of Râma, first? He
would quickly comprehend this Doctrine.'

   "Then, O priests, a deity announced to me,

   "'Reverend Sir, Uddaka, the disciple of Râma, died yesterday at
night-fall.'

   "Also in me, O priests, the knowledge sprang up, 'Uddaka, the
disciple of Râma, died yesterday at night-fall.'

   "Then, O priests, it occurred to me as follows:

   "'A noble man was Uddaka, the disciple of Râma. Surely, if he could
have heard this Doctrine, he would quickly have comprehended it.'

   "Then, O priests, it occurred to me as follows:

   "'To whom had I best teach the Doctrine first? Who would quickly
comprehend this Doctrine?'

   "Then, O priests, it occurred to me as follows:

   "'Of great service has this band of five priests been, who waited
upon me while I devoted myself to the struggle. What if I teach the
Doctrine to the band of five priests first? ,

   "Then, O priests, it occurred to me as follows:

   "'Where does the band of five priests dwell at present?'

   "And I, O priests, with my divinely clear vision surpassing that of
men, saw the band of five priests dwelling at Benares, in the deer-park
Isipatana.

   "Then, O priests, having dwelt at Uruvelâ as long as I wished, I
proceeded on my wanderings in the direction of Benares. And Upaka, a
naked ascetic, beheld me proceeding along the highway between the
Bo-tree and Gayâ. And having seen me, he spoke to me as follows:

   "'Placid, brother, are all your organs of sense; clear and

|                                   |                                                   |

bright is the color of your skin. To follow whom, brother, did you
retire from the world? Who is your teacher? and whose doctrine do you
approve?'

   "When, O priests, Upaka, the naked ascetic, had thus spoken, I
addressed him in the following stanzas:

</colgroup>

   "'You may be right, brother,' replied Upaka, the naked ascetic; and
shaking his head, he took another road and departed.

   "Then, O priests, I proceeded on my wanderings from place to place,
and drew near to Benares, to the deer-park Isipatana, and to where the
band of five priests was. And, O priests, the band of five priests saw
me approaching from afar, and, when they had seen me, they made an
agreement among themselves, saying:

|                                   |                                                   |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_344">p. 344</span> | <span class="small">\[M.i.171<sup>22</sup></span> |

   "'Here, brethren, is the monk Gotama approaching, that luxurious
fellow who gave up the struggle and devoted himself to a life of luxury.
Let us not salute him, nor rise and go to meet hiIn, nor relieve him of
his bowl and his robe. We will merely spread a seat for him: he can then
sit down, if he is so inclined.'

   "But, O priests, as I gradually approached, the band of five priests
found themselves unable to hold to their agreement, and rising to meet
me, one of them relieved me of my bowl and my robe, another spread a
seat for me, and another brought water for washing my feet. But, O
priests, they addressed me by my name, and by the title of 'Brother.'
When, O priests, I noticed this, I spoke to the band of five priests as
follows:

   "'O priests, address not The Tathâgata by his name, nor by the title
of "Brother." A saint, O priests, is The Tathâgata, a Supreme Buddha.
Give ear, O priests! The deathless has been gained, and I will instruct
you, and teach you the Doctrine. If ye will do according to my
instructions, in no long time, and in the present life, ye shall learn
for yourselves, and shall realize and live in the possession of that
highest good to which the holy life conducts, and for the sake of which
youths of good family so nobly retire from the household life to the
houseless one.'

   "When I had thus spoken, O priests, the band of five priests said to
me as follows:

   "'Brother Gotama, those practices of yours, that method of procedure,
those stern austerities did not enable you to transcend human
limitations and attain to pre-eminence in full and sublime knowledge and
insight. How, then, now that you are luxurious, and have given up the
struggle and devoted yourself to a life of luxury, can you have
transcended human limitations and attained to pre-eminence in full and
sublime knowledge and insight?'

   "When they had thus spoken, O priests, I said to the band of five
priests as follows:

   "'O priests, The Tathâgata is not luxurious, and has not given up the
struggle and devoted himself to a life of luxury.

|                                   |                                                   |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_345">p. 345</span> | <span class="small">\[M.i.172<sup>15</sup></span> |

A saint, O priests, is The Tathâgata, a Supreme Buddha. Give ear, O
priests! The deathless has been gained, and I will instruct you, and
teach you the Doctrine. If ye will do according to my instructions, in
no long time, and in the present life, ye shall learn for yourselves,
and shall realize and live in the possession of that highest good to
which the holy life conducts, and for the sake of which youths of good
family so nobly retire from the household life to the houseless one.'

   "And a second time, O priests, the band of five priests spoke to me
as follows:

.     .     .     .     .     .     .

   "And a second time, O priests, I replied to the band of five priests
as follows:

.     .     .     .     .     .     .

   "And a third time, O priests, the band of five priests spoke to me as
follows:

.     .     .     .     .     .     .

   "When they had thus spoken, O priests, I replied to the band of five
priests as follows:

   "'Confess, O priests, have I ever before spoken to you as I have done
this day?'

   "'Nay, verily, Reverend Sir.'

   "'A saint, O priests, is The Tathâgata, a Supreme Buddha. Give ear, O
priests' The deathless has been gained, and I will instruct you, and
teach you the Doctrine. If ye will do according to my instructions, in
no long time, and in the present life, ye shall learn for yourselves,
and shall realize and live in the possession of that highest good to
which the holy life conducts, and for the sake of which youths of good
family so nobly retire from the household life to the houseless one.'

   "And I, O priests, succeeded in winning over the band of five
priests.

   "And I, O priests, exhorted two priests, while three priests went for
alms; and the food which the three priests brought back from their
begging-rounds furnished subsistence for all us six. And I, O priests,
exhorted three priests,

|                                   |                                                  |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_346">p. 346</span> | <span class="small">\[M.i.173<sup>5</sup></span> |

while two priests went for alms; and the food which the two priests
brought back from their begging-rounds furnished subsistence for all us
six.

   "Then, O priests, the band of five priests, thus exhorted and
instructed by me, themselves subject to birth, perceived the
wretchedness of what is subject to birth, and craving the incomparable
security of a Nirvana free from birth, attained the incomparable
security of a Nirvana free from birth; themselves subject to old age, .
. . disease, . . . death, . . . sorrow, . . . corruption, . . .
perceived the wretchedness of what is subject to corruption, and craving
the incomparable security of a Nirvana free from corruption, attained
the incomparable security of a Nirvana free from corruption. And the
knowledge and the insight sprang up within them, 'Our deliverance is
unshakable; this is our last existence; no more shall we be born again.'

   "There are five sensual pleasures, O priests. And what are the five?
Forms perceivable by the eye, delightful, pleasant, charming, lovely,
accompanied with sensual pleasure, and exciting passion; sounds
perceivable by the ear, . . . odors perceivable by the nose, . . .
tastes perceivable by the tongue, . . . things tangible perceivable by
the body, delightful, pleasant, charming, lovely, accompanied with
sensual pleasure, and exciting passion. These, O priests, are the five
sensual pleasures.

   "All monks and Brahmans, O priests, who partake of these sensual
pleasures, and are enveloped, besotted, immersed in them, and perceive
not their wretchedness, and know not the way of escape, of them is it to
be understood as follows: 'They have lighted on misfortune, have lighted
on destruction, and are in the power of the Wicked One.'

   "Just as if, O priests, a deer of the forest were to step into a
snare, and were to be caught by it. Concerning this deer it is to be
understood as follows: 'It has lighted on misfortune, has lighted on
destruction, and is in the power of the hunter. When the hunter shall
come, it will not be able to make its escape.' In exactly the same way,
O priests, all monks and Brahmans who partake of these sensual
pleasures,

|                                   |                                                   |

and enveloped, besotted, and immersed in them, perceive not their
wretchedness, and know not the way of escape, of them is it to be
understood as follows: 'They have lighted on misfortune, have lighted on
destruction, and are in the power of the Wicked One.'

   "On the other hand, O priests, all monks and Brahmans who partake of
these sensual pleasures, and are not enveloped, besotted, and immersed
in them, but perceive their wretchedness, and know the way of escape, of
them is it to be understood as follows: 'They have not lighted on
misfortune, have not lighted on destruction, and are not in the power of
the Wicked One.'

   "Just as if, O priests, a deer of the forest were to step into a
snare, and were not to be caught by it. Concerning this deer it is to be
understood as follows: 'It has not lighted on misfortune, has not
lighted on destruction, and is not in the power of the hunter. When the
hunter shall come, it will be able to make its escape.' In exactly the
same way, O priests, all monks and Brahmans who do not partake of these
sensual pleasures, and not enveloped, nor besotted, nor immersed in
them, perceive their wretchedness, and know the way of escape, of them
is it to be understood as follows: 'They have not lighted on misfortune,
have not lighted on destruction, and are not in the power of the Wicked
One.'

   "Just as if, O priests, a deer of the forest were to roam the woods
and mountain slopes; he can walk, stand, squat, and lie down in
confident security. And why? Because, O priests, he is out of the reach
of the hunter. In exactly the same way, O priests, a priest, having
isolated himself from sensual pleasures, having isolated himself from
demeritorious traits, and still exercising reasoning, still exercising
reflection, enters upon the first trance which is produced by isolation,
and characterized by joy and happiness. Of such a priest, O priests, is
it said, 'He has blinded Mâra, made useless the eye of Mâra, gone out of
sight of the Wicked One.'

   "But again, O priests, a priest, through the subsidence of reasoning
and reflection, and still retaining joy and happiness, enters upon the
second trance, which is an interior tranquilization

|                                   |                                                   |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_348">p. 348</span> | <span class="small">\[M.i.174<sup>18</sup></span> |

and intentness of the thoughts, and is produced by concentration. Of
such a priest, O priests, is it said, 'He has blinded Mâra, made useless
the eye of Mâra, gone out of sight of the Wicked One.'

   "But again, O priests, a priest through the paling of joy,
indifferent, contemplative, conscious, and in the experience of bodily
happiness--that state which eminent men describe when they say,
'Indifferent, contemplative, and living happily'--enters upon the third
trance. Of such a priest, O priests, is it said, 'He has blinded Mâra,
made useless the eye of Mâra, gone out of sight of the Wicked One.'

   "But again, O priests, a priest through the abandonment of happiness,
through the abandonment of misery, through the disappearance of all
antecedent gladness or grief, enters upon the fourth trance, which has
neither misery nor happiness, but is contemplation as refined by
indifference. Of such a priest, O priests, is it said, 'He has blinded
Mâra, made useless the eye of Mâra, gone out of sight of the Wicked
One.'

   "But again, O priests, a priest through having completely overpassed
all perceptions of form, through the perishing of perceptions of
inertia, and through ceasing to dwell on perceptions of diversity, says
to himself, 'Space is infinite,' and dwells in the realm of the infinity
of space. Of such a priest, O priests, is it said, 'He has blinded Mâra,
made useless the eye of Mâra, gone out of sight of the Wicked One.'

   "But again, O priests, a priest through having completely overpassed
the realm of the infinity of space, says to himself, 'Consciousness is
infinite,' and dwells in the realm of the infinity of consciousness. Of
such a priest, O priests, is it said, 'He has blinded Mâra, made useless
the eye of Mâra, gone out of sight of the Wicked One.'

   "But again, O priests, a priest through having completely overpassed
the realm of the infinity of consciousness, says to himself, 'Nothing
exists,' and dwells in the realm of nothingness. Of such a priest, O
priests, is it said, 'He has blinded Mâra, made useless the eye of Mâra,
gone out of sight of the Wicked One.'

|                                   |                                                  |

| <span id="page_349">p. 349</span> | <span class="small">\[M.i.175<sup>1</sup></span> |

   "But again, O priests, a priest through having completely overpassed
the realm of nothingness, dwells in the realm of neither perception nor
yet non-perception. Of such a priest, O priests, is it said, 'He has
blinded Mâra, made useless the eye of Mâra, gone out of sight of the
Wicked One.'

   "But again, O priests, a priest through having completely overpassed
the realm of neither perception nor yet non-perception, arrives at the
cessation of perception and sensation, and before the clear vision of
wisdom all his depravity wastes away. Of such a priest, O priests, is it
said, 'He has blinded Mâra, made useless the eye of Mâra, gone out of
sight of the Wicked One, and passed beyond all adhesion to the world.'
He walks, stands, squats, and lies down in confident security. And why?
Because, O priests, he is out of the reach of Mâra."

   Thus spake The Blessed One; and the delighted priests applauded the
speech of The Blessed One.
