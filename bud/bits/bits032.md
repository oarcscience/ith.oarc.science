§ 32. SENSATION.

<span class="small">Translated from the Majjhima-Nikâya (Sutta 44 or
i.302<sup>28</sup>).</span>

   "My lady \[Dhammadinnâ\], how many sensations are there?"

   "Brother Visâkha, there are three sensations; the pleasant sensation,
the unpleasant sensation, and the indifferent sensation."

   "But what, my lady, is the pleasant sensation, what the unpleasant
sensation, and what the indifferent sensation?"

   "Brother Visâkha, whatever pleasant or joyous sensation is felt by
the body or by the mind, that is pleasant sensation. Brother Visâkha,
whatever unpleasant or joyless sensation is felt by the body or by the
mind, that is unpleasant sensation. Brother Visâkha, whatever sensation
that is neither joyous nor joyless is felt by the body or by the mind,
that is indifferent sensation."
