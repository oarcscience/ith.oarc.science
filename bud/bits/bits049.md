§ 49. DIFFERENT KINDS OF DEATH.

<span class="small">Translated from the Visuddhi-Magga (chap.
viii.).</span>

   By death is meant the cutting off of the vitality comprised in any
one existence. Now the death of the saint, which consists in the
annihilation of the misery of rebirth; incessant death, which is the
incessant breaking up of the constituents of being; and death in popular
parlance, as when it is said, "The tree is dead, the iron is
dead,"--none of these is meant here. But what is meant here is twofold,
either natural death, or untimely death.

   *Natural death* occurs either by the exhaustion of merit, or by the
exhaustion of the natural term of life, or by the exhaustion of both.

   *Untimely death* occurs by karma cutting off karma.

   Death by the exhaustion of merit is death which supervenes when the
karma which caused conception has ripened to a termination, although the
dependence for continuing the series constituting the term of life be
not exhausted. Death by the exhaustion of the natural term of life
occurs when the span of life, the nutritive powers, etc., proper to any
given grade of existence, come to an end,--in the present race of men on
the exhaustion of their natural term of life at the age of only one
hundred years.

   Untimely death is death like that of Dusî Mâra, or of king Kalâbu and
others, who had their series cut off by

karma that carried them off on the spot, or like that of such persons as
have their series cut off by a bloody death brought upon them by the
karma of a previous existence.
