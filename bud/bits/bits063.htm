These, by listening to the Doctrine of The Blessed One, became destined to conversion, and in the second or third existence would enter the Paths. The frog who became a god is an illustration.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As tradition relates, The Blessed One was teaching the Doctrine to the inhabitants of the town of Camp&acirc;, on the banks of Lake Gaggar&acirc;; and a certain frog, at the sound of The Blessed One's voice, obtained the mental reflex. And a certain cowherd, as he stood leaning on his staff, pinned him down fast by the head.

And while I listened to thy Law,<BR>
A cowherd crushed me, and I died."<BR>
