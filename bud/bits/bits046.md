§ 46. IS THIS TO BE MY LAST EXISTENCE?

<span class="small">Translated from the Milindapañha
(41<sup>11</sup>).</span>

   "Bhante Nâgasena," said the king, "does a man know when he is not to
be born into another existence?"

   "Assuredly, your majesty, a man knows when he is not to be born into
another existence."

   "Bhante, how does he know it?"

   "He knows it from the cessation of all cause or reason for being born
into another existence."

   "Give an illustration."

   "It is as if, your majesty, a house-holding farmer were to plow and
sow and fill his granary; and then were neither to plow nor sow, and
were to use the grain previously stored up, or give it away, or do with
it however else might suit him: your majesty, would this house-holding
farmer know that his granary would not become filled up again?"

   "Assuredly, bhante, would he know it."

   "How would he know it?"

   "He would know it from the cessation of all cause or reason for the
filling up of the granary."

   "In exactly the same way, your majesty, a man knows when he is not to
be born into another existence, from the cessation of all cause or
reason for being born into another existence."

   "You are an able man, bhante Nâgasena."
