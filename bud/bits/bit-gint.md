GENERAL INTRODUCTION.

   T<span class="small">HE</span> materials for this book are drawn
ultimately from the Pâli writings of Ceylon and Burma,--that is to say,
they are to be found in palm-leaf manuscripts of those countries,
written in the Singhalese or Burmese alphabet, as the case may be, but
always in the same Pâli language, a tongue very nearly akin to the
Sanskrit. These Pâli writings furnish the most authoritative account of
The Buddha and his Doctrine that we have; and it is therefore to be
regretted that, inasmuch as so little has been known in the Occident
until recently of either Pâli or Pâli literature, the information of the
public concerning Buddhism has been so largely drawn from books based on
other, non-Pâli, sources, on works written in the Singhalese, Chinese,
and Tibetan languages, and in the Buddhist-Sanskrit of Nepaul. But a
large number of Pâli manuscripts have now been edited and printed in the
publications of the Pâli Text Society of London, and in scattered works
both in England and in other European countries, and several volumes of
translations into English have appeared, so that all excuse for not
deriving our knowledge of Buddhism from the most authentic sources is
fast disappearing.

   As the work on this book has been done wholly in America, my main
reliance has naturally been on printed texts. Still, I have had the use
of a number of Pâli manuscripts. In Brown University at Providence,
Rhode <span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span> Island, there are many
manuscripts, in the Burmese character, of works belonging to the
Buddhist Scriptures. These were presented by the Rev. Dr. J. N. Cushing,
Baptist missionary to Burma, and an alumnus of the University. But the
manuscripts which, as being both important and unedited, have proved of
most value to me, are four copies of the extensive and systematic
treatise on Buddhist Doctrine composed by the famous Buddhaghosa, who
flourished in the fourth century A. D. It is called the "Way of Purity"
(in Pâli, Visuddhi-Magga). These four manuscripts have come to me from
England: one is from the private collection of Prof. T. W. Rhys Davids,
Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society; the second belonged to the late
Rev. Dr. Richard Morris of Harold Wood, Essex; the third to Henry Rigg,
Esq., consulting engineer to the Government of India, for railways;
while for the loan of the fourth, a Burmese manuscript, my thanks are
due to the India Office Library.

   The Pâli literature chiefly consists of the Buddhist Scriptures and
their commentaries. These form an extensive body of works, many of which
are individually very large. The Singhalese canon proper--that is to
say, the texts without the commentaries--has been estimated by Prof.
Rhys Davids to contain about twice as much matter as the Christian
Bible. From this estimate Professor Davids excludes the repetitions,
which, as he well says, are "some of them very frequent, and others very
long." The Christian Bible is divided into two Testaments, whereas the
Buddhist canon, or Bible, has three main divisions called "Baskets" (in
Pâli, Pitaka), and the Buddhist Bible, consequently, is called "The
Three Baskets" (Ti-Pitaka).

   The first Testament, Basket, or Pitaka has been edited and published
by Oldenberg, and a translation <span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span> of a
large part of it has appeared in the "Sacred Books of the East." This
Pitaka gives the various rules and ordinances to be observed by the
Buddhist Order, and is therefore called the "Discipline-Basket" (in
Pâli, Vinaya-Pitaka). A large part of this Pitaka is dry and technical
reading; but by no means all of it is of this nature, for there is
interspersed much narrative of events in the life of The Buddha. The
Buddha himself is supposed to have laid down all these rules as occasion
suggested their necessity, and the object of these stories is to explain
the circumstances under which he did so. The works of this Pitaka are
five, as follows:--

|                     |                 |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Bhikkhu-Vibhanga;   | Culla-Vagga;    |
| Bhikkhunî-Vibhanga; | Parivâra-pâtha. |
| Mahâ-Vagga;         |                 |

   The second of the three Testaments, or Baskets, is called the
Sutta-Pitaka, which may be translated the "Sermon-Basket." It consists
of a great number of sermons and discourses in prose and verse,
delivered by The Buddha or some one of his disciples, and is extremely
interesting to any one studying the philosophy and folk-lore of
Buddhism. The list of the works which, according to the Singhalese
canon, belong to this Pitaka is as follows:--

|                                |
|--------------------------------|
| Dîgha-Nikâya;                  |
| Majjhima-Nikâya;               |
| Samyutta-Nikâya;               |
| Anguttara-Nikâya;              |
| Khuddaka-Nikâya, consisting of |

|                 |                     |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Khuddaka-Pâtha; | Therî-Gâthâ;        |
| Dhammapada;     | Jâtaka;             |
| Udâna;          | Niddesa;            |
| Itivuttaka;     | Patisambhidâ-Magga; |
| Sutta-Nipâta;   | Apadâna;            |
| Vimâna-Vatthu;  | Buddha-Vamsa;       |
| Peta-Vatthu;    | Cariyâ-Pitaka;      |
| Thera-Gâthâ.    |                     |

|                                       |                             |
|:--------------------------------------|----------------------------:|
| <span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span> | <span class="small"></span> |

   The works composing the third and last Pitaka are, of all the
Buddhist Scriptures, the dreariest and most forbidding reading, and this
is saying a great deal. However, like the desert of Sahara, they are to
be respected for their immensity; and when they are all printed, no
doubt something can be made of them. The title of this Pitaka is the
"Metaphysical Basket" (in Pâli, Abhidhamma-Pitaka). It is composed of
the following works:--

|                   |              |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Dhamma-Sangani;   | Dhâtu-Kathâ; |
| Vibhanga;         | Yamaka;      |
| Kathâ-Vatthu;     | Patthâna.    |
| Puggala-Paññatti; |              |

   This completes the list of the works composing the Tipitaka or
Buddhist Scriptures. A number of them have not been printed in their
entirety, and still others not at all.<span
id="page_xviii_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_xviii_note_1)

   The non-canonical works consist of numerous commentaries on the
Tipitaka, and of several other writings of more or less importance. The
Buddhaghosa above mentioned was a most prolific commentator, and his
Sumangala-Vilâsinî; or commentary on the Dîgha-Nikâya, <span
id="page_xix">p. xix</span> is in the Providence collection, and has
also partially appeared in type. Of others of his commentaries I have
seen only fragments; but, as above stated, I have his general work
entitled the Visuddhi-Magga.

   Of works which are not commentaries, there is a dictionary of
synonyms written in verse, and called the Abhidhâna-ppadîpikâ. Then
there is the Milindapañha (Questions of Milinda). Milinda (Greek
Menander) was a Greek king who carried on the Greek dominion in Bactria
founded by Alexander the Great. He probably lived in the second century
B. C., and the Milindapañha was probably composed about the beginning of
our era. The Milindapañha is, strictly speaking, a North Buddhist work,
but it is considered so orthodox by the South Buddhists, i.e. by the
Buddhists of Ceylon, Burma, and Siam, that I have felt bold to draw upon
it freely in this book. Then there are the Abhidhammattha-Sangaha, the
Sârasangaha, the Anâgata-Vamsa, and some other works on grammar,
history, and so forth, the names of which I spare the reader, as no
translation from them occurs in this book.

   After long bothering my head over Sanskrit, I found much more
satisfaction when I took up the study of Pâli. For Sanskrit literature
is a chaos; Pâli, a cosmos. In Sanskrit every fresh work or author
seemed a new problem; and as trustworthy Hindu chronology and recorded
history are almost nil, and as there are many systems of philosophy,
orthodox as well as unorthodox, the necessary data for the solution of
the problem were usually lacking. Such data, I mean, as who the author
was, when he lived and wrote, what were the current beliefs and
conceptions of his day, and what his own position was in respect of
them; such data, in short, as are necessary in order to know what to
think <span id="page_xx">p. xx</span> of an author, and fully to
understand what he says. Now the subject matter of Pâli literature is
nearly always the same, namely, the definite system of religion
propounded by The Buddha. Indeed, in a large part of the writings, The
Buddha appears as a dramatis persona. We have volumes and volumes of
sermons, discourses, and moral tales credited to him, and hundreds of
incidents related, apropos of which he pronounced some dictum. And the
place of such utterance is usually given. Consequently, although there
is a large field for text criticism--a field on which I have not felt it
desirable to enter in this book--there is, in a general way and in
respect of subject matter, considerable unity in Pâli literature.

   The aim of the present work is to take different ideas and
conceptions found in Pâli writings, and present them to the reader in
English. Translation has been the means employed as being the most
effectual, and the order pursued is in the main that of the Buddhist
"Three Jewels" (in Pâli, Ti-Ratana), to wit, The Buddha, the Doctrine,
and the Order. The selections of the first chapter are on The Buddha;
next follow those which deal chiefly with the Doctrine; while others
concerning the Order and secular life constitute the closing chapter of
the book.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

<span id="page_xviii_note_1"></span>[1](#page_xviii_fr_1) Since the
above was written, the King of Siam, who has long been a patron of Pâli
studies, has presented Harvard College and a number of other
institutions of learning with an edition of Tipitaka works. This gift
was made on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of his
accession to the throne, and consists of thirty-nine volumes printed in
the Siamese character. The first and third Pitakas are complete, as well
as the first four Nikâyas of the second Pitaka; but of the
Khuddaka-Nikâya I find only the Khuddaka-Pâtha, Dhammapada, Udâna,
Itivuttaka, Sutta-Nipâta, Niddesa, and Patisambhidâ-Magga. Most of the
other works of this Nikâya have been or are being edited in Europe, so
that the only Tipitaka work which has not appeared, at least partially,
in type is the Apadâna. This splendid present made by the King of Siam
was, I am sorry to say, received too late to be drawn upon for
selections for this volume.
