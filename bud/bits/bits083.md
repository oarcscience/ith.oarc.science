§ 83. THE BUDDHIST CONFESSION OF PRIESTS.

<span class="small"><span id="83a">§ 83 *a*.--Translated from the
Mahâ-Vagga (ii.1<sup>1</sup>).</span></span>

   Now at that time The Buddha, The Blessed One, was dwelling at
Râjagaha on Vulture Peak. And at that time the heretical sect of
wandering ascetics met together on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth
day of the half-month, and recited their doctrine. And the people drew
near to listen to their doctrine, and conceived a liking for the
heretical sect of wandering ascetics, and put faith in their teachings;
and the heretical sect of wandering ascetics gained adherents.

|                                   |                                                  |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_403">p. 403</span> | <span class="small">\[MV.ii.1<sup>2</sup></span> |

   Now it happened to Seniya Bimbisâra, king of Magadha, being in
seclusion and plunged in meditation, that a consideration presented
itself to his mind, as follows:

   "Here the heretical sect of wandering ascetics meet together on the
fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of the half-month, and recite
their doctrine. And the people draw near to listen to their doctrine,
and conceive a liking for the heretical sect of wandering ascetics, and
put faith in them; and the heretical sect of wandering ascetics gain
adherents. What if now the reverend ones also were to meet together on
the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of the half-month."

   Then drew near Seniya Bimbisâra, king of Magadha, to where The
Blessed One was; and having drawn near and greeted The Blessed One, he
sat down respectfully at one side. And seated respectfully at one side,
Seniya Bimbisâra, king of Magadha, spoke to The Blessed One as follows:

   "Reverend Sir, it happened to me, as I was just now seated in
seclusion and plunged in meditation, that a consideration presented
itself to my mind, as follows: 'Here the heretical sect of wandering
ascetics meet together on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of
the half-month, and recite their doctrine. And the people draw near to
listen to their doctrine, and conceive a liking for the heretical sect
of wandering ascetics, and put faith in them; and the heretical sect of
wandering ascetics gain adherents. What if now the reverend ones also
were to meet together on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of
the half-month?'"

   Then The Blessed One enlightened, incited, quickened, and gladdened
Seniya Bimbisâra, king of Magadha, with a doctrinal discourse. And
Seniya Bimbisâra, king of Magadha, enlightened, incited, quickened, and
gladdened by The Blessed One with a doctrinal discourse, rose from his
seat and saluted The Blessed One; and keeping his right side toward him,
he departed.

   Then The Blessed One, on this occasion and in this connection, after
he had delivered a doctrinal discourse, addressed the priests:

|                                   |                                                  |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_404">p. 404</span> | <span class="small">\[MV.ii.1<sup>4</sup></span> |

   "I prescribe, O priests, that ye meet together on the fourteenth,
fifteenth, and eighth day of the half-month."

   Now at that time the priests, having understood that The Blessed One
had prescribed that they should meet together on the fourteenth,
fifteenth, and eighth day of the half-month, met together on the
fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of the half-month, and sat in
silence. And the people drew near to listen to the Doctrine, and were
angered, annoyed, and spoke indignantly:

   "How is it, pray, that the Sakyaputta monks, when they meet together
on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of the half-month, sit in
silence like dumb hogs? Why should they meet together, if not to recite
the Doctrine?"

   And the priests heard that the people were angered, annoyed, and
spoke indignantly. And the priests announced the matter to The Blessed
One.

   Then The Blessed One, on this occasion and in this connection, after
he had delivered a doctrinal discourse, addressed the priests:

   "I prescribe, O priests, that when ye have met together on the
fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of the half-month, ye recite the
Doctrine."

   Now it happened to The Blessed One, being in seclusion and plunged in
meditation, that a consideration presented itself to his mind, as
follows:

   "What if now I prescribe that the priests recite a confession
\[pâtimokkha\] of all those precepts which have been laid down by me;
and this shall be for them a fast-day duty?"

   Then The Blessed One, in the evening of the day, rose from his
meditation, and on this occasion and in this connection, after he had
delivered a doctrinal discourse, addressed the priests:

   "O priests, it happened to me, as I was just now seated in seclusion
and plunged in meditation, that a consideration presented itself to my
mind, as follows: 'What if now I prescribe that the priests recite a
confession of all those precepts which have been laid down by me; and
this shall be for them a fast-day duty?' I prescribe, O priests, that

|                                   |                                                  |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_405">p. 405</span> | <span class="small">\[MV.ii.3<sup>2</sup></span> |

ye recite a confession. And after this manner, O priests, is it to be
recited:

   "Let a learned and competent priest make announcement to the
congregation, saying, 'Let the reverend congregation hear me. To-day is
the fast-day of the fifteenth day of the half-month. If the congregation
be ready, let the congregation keep fast-day, and recite the confession.
What is the first business before the congregation? Venerable sirs, the
proclaiming of your innocency. I will recite the confession. and let as
many of us as are here present listen carefully and pay strict
attention. If anyone have sinned, let him reveal the fact; if he have
not sinned, let him remain silent; by your silence I shall know that
your reverences are innocent. But now, in assemblages like this,
proclamation is made up to the third time, and each one must make
confession as if individually asked. But if, when proclamation up to the
third time has been made, any priest shall remember a sin and not reveal
it, it will be a conscious falsehood. But a conscious falsehood,
reverend sirs, has been declared by The Blessed One to be a deadly sin.
Therefore, if a priest remember having committed a sin, and desire again
to be pure, let him reveal the sin he committed, and when it has been
revealed, it shall be well for him.'"

1875.</span></span>

   On the 2nd of January, 1874, being the full-moon day of the month
Phussa, I was permitted, by the kindness of my friend Kæwitiyâgala
Unnânsê, to be present at a chapter of priests assembled for the
recitation of the Pâtimokkha or office of the confession of priests. The
chapter was held in the Sîmâ or consecrated space in the ancient
Lohapâsâda, or Brazen Palace, in the city of Anurâdhapura, and under the
shadow of the sacred Bo-tree, grown from a branch of the tree at Buddha
Gayâ, under which, as tradition relates, the prince Siddhârtha attained
to supreme Buddhahood. The branch was sent to Devânampiyatissa, King of
Ceylon, by the Emperor Açoka, in the year 288 B. C., now upwards of

|                                   |                                                        |

two thousand years ago. It was in this remarkable spot, under the shadow
of the oldest historical tree, and in probably the oldest chapter-house
in the world, that it was my good fortune to be present at this service.
The building has none of its original magnificence. The colossal stone
pillars alone remain as a memorial of the devotion of the kings and
people of Ceylon to the religion which was taught them by Mahendra, the
great apostle of Buddhism. In place of the nine storeys which these
pillars once supported, a few in the centre are now made to carry a poor
thatched roof no larger than that of a cotter's hut, and hardly
sufficient to protect the chapter from the inclemencies of the weather.
Still there was a simple and imposing grandeur in the scene. At the back
of some dozen or more of these gigantic pillars were stretched pieces of
white calico, to form the sides of the room: the ceiling in like manner
was formed by stretching white calico above the pillars to conceal the
shabby roof, the bare ground was covered with clean mats, two lamps gave
a dim light, the huge columns, grey with age, stood out against the
white calico. At the top of the long room thus formed was hung a curtain
of bright colors, and through a space left for the entrance were
visible, row after row, the pillars of the ancient palace, their broad
shadows contrasting with the silvery brightness of the tropical moon.

   Accompanied by a friend, I went to the chapter-house about seven
o'clock in the evening; we were met at the door by the priests, who
showed us to the places prepared for us--two cushions on the floor at
the bottom of the room, at a distance of about two fathoms from the
place reserved for the priests. The ordinances of Buddha require that
all persons who are not ordained priests, free at the time from all
liability to ecclesiastical censure, shall keep at a distance of two and
a half cubits from the assembled chapter. It was on my pointing out that
this was the only direction of Buddha on the subject, that the priests
consented to make an exception in my favor, and to break their rule of
meeting in secret conclave.

   After we were seated the priests retired two and two together, each
pair knelt down face to face and made confession

|                                   |                                                        |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_407">p. 407</span> | <span class="small">\[JRAS.viii.63<sup>28</sup></span> |

of their faults, one to another, in whispers. Their confessions being
ended, they took their seats on mats covered with white calico, in two
rows facing each other. The senior priest, the seniority being reckoned
from the date of ordination, sat at the head of one row, the next in
order at the head of the opposite row, the third next to the senior
priest, and so on right and left down the room. The senior priest
remained sitting, the others knelt and made obeisance to him, saying--

   Permit me. Lord, give me absolution from all my faults committed in
deed, or word, or thought.

   The senior then says--

   I absolve you, brother. It is good to grant me absolution. All
reply-- Permit me. Lord, I absolve you.

   The second in order of seniority now resumes his seat, and all his
juniors kneel and receive and give absolution, saying, Permit me, etc.,
as above; he then takes his seat, and the others kneel to him, and so
on, till no one has a junior present, that is to say, if there are
thirty priests present, the senior will receive obeisance from the
twenty-nine others together, the second from the twenty-eight, and so on
down to the twenty-ninth, who will receive obeisance from one. After all
are seated, they fall together on their knees and say--

   Praise be to the blessed one, the holy one, the author of all truth.
(This is said three times.)

   We believe in the Blessed one, the holy one, the author of all truth,
who has fully accomplished the eight kinds of supernatural knowledge and
the fifteen holy practices, who came the good journey which led to the
Buddhahood, who knows the universe, the unrivalled, who has made subject
to him all mortal beings, whether in heaven or in earth, the Teacher of
Gods and men, the blessed Buddha. Through life till I reach Nirvâna I
will put my trust in Buddha.

   The Law was graciously preached by Buddha, its effects are immediate,
it is unlimited by time, it is conducive to salvation, it invites all
comers, it is a fitting object of contemplation, the wise ponder it in
their hearts. Through life till I reach Nirvâna I will put my trust in
the Law.

   Buddha's holy Church, the congregation of righteous men that lead a
godly life, that walk in the straight way, in the way of wisdom, that
walk faithfully in the four paths of holiness, the eight orders of the
elect, worthy of offerings from afar, worthy of fresh offerings, worthy
of offerings of the daily necessaries of life, entitled to receive the
respectful salutation of joined hands raised in homage to the forehead,
this holy Church produces merit which, like unto a rich field, yields
its increase for the benefit of this world of men.

   The priests here rise from their knees and resume their seats. The
senior, or some other deputed in his stead to officiate, then takes a
seat at the top between the two rows. The interrogatories are then
proceeded with as will be found explained in the following translation
of the Pâtimokkha. The interrogatories being ended, the Pâtimokkha is
intoned after the manner followed to this day by the Roman Church.

   The office for priestesses . . . has been omitted in the present
edition, because the order of priestesses is not now recognized by the
orthodox Buddhists.

   The text of this edition is derived from MSS. in use at the Malwattê
Monastery in Kandy, and it will be found divided into ten chapters, as
follows:--

I.

Interrogatories relating to the requisites for forming a chapter.

II\.

The Introduction.

III\.

The four deadly sins.

IV\.

The thirteen faults involving temporary separation from the priesthood.

V.

The two undetermined offences.

VI\.

The thirty faults requiring confession and absolution, and involving
forfeiture of the article in reference to which the offence has been
committed.

VII\.

The ninety-two faults requiring confession and absolution.

VIII\.

Four offences requiring confession.

IX\.

The seventy-five rules of conduct.

X.

The seven rules for settling cases.

   The whole is sometimes known as the two hundred and twenty-seven
precepts.
