<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bhante N&acirc;gasena," said the king, "does a man know when he is not to be born into another existence?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Assuredly, your majesty, a man knows when he is not to be born into another existence."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bhante, how does he know it?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He knows it from the cessation of all cause or reason for being born into another existence."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give an illustration."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is as if, your majesty, a house-holding farmer were to plow and sow and fill his granary; and then were neither to plow nor sow, and were to use the grain previously stored up, or give it away, or do with it however else might suit him: your majesty, would this house-holding farmer know that his granary would not become filled up again?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Assuredly, bhante, would he know it."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How would he know it?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He would know it from the cessation of all cause or reason for the filling up of the granary."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In exactly the same way, your majesty, a man knows when he is not to be born into another existence, from the cessation of all cause or reason for being born into another existence."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are an able man, bhante N&acirc;gasena."</P>
