§ 9. FIRST EVENTS AFTER THE ATTAINMENT OF BUDDHASHIP.

<span class="small">Translated from the Mahâ-Vagga, and constituting the
opening sections.</span>

<span class="small">Hail to that Blessed One, that Saint, and Supreme
Buddha!</span>

   A<span class="small">T</span> that time The Buddha, The Blessed One,
was dwelling at Uruvelâ at the foot of the Bo-tree on the banks of the
river Nerañjarâ, having just attained the Buddhaship. Then The Blessed
One sat cross-legged for seven days together at the foot of the Bo-tree
experiencing the bliss of emancipation.

|                                 |                                                 |

   Then The Blessed One, during the first watch of the night, thought
over Dependent Origination both forward and back:--

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>On ignorance depends karma;<br />
On karma depends consciousness;<br />
On consciousness depend name and form;<br />
On name and form depend the six organs of sense;<br />
On the six organs of sense depends contact;<br />
On contact depends sensation;<br />
On sensation depends desire;<br />
On desire depends attachment;<br />
On attachment depends existence;<br />
On existence depends birth;<br />
On birth depend old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, misery, grief, and despair.<br />
</td>

Thus does this entire aggregation of misery arise. But on the complete
fading out and cessation of ignorance ceases karma; on the cessation of
karma ceases consciousness; on the cessation of consciousness cease name
and form; on the cessation of name and form cease the six organs of
sense; on the cessation of the six organs of sense ceases contact; on
the cessation of contact ceases sensation; on the cessation of sensation
ceases desire; on the cessation of desire ceases attachment; on the
cessation of attachment ceases existence; on the cessation of existence
ceases birth; on the cessation of birth cease old age and death, sorrow,
lamentation, misery, grief, and despair. Thus does this entire
aggregation of misery cease.

   Then The Blessed One, concerning this, on that occasion, breathed
forth this solemn utterance,--

   Then The Blessed One, during the middle watch of the

night, thought over Dependent Origination both forward and back:--On
ignorance depends karma. . . . Thus does this entire aggregation of
misery arise. But on the complete fading out and cessation of ignorance
ceases karma. . . . Thus does this entire aggregation of misery cease.

   Then The Blessed One, concerning this, on that occasion, breathed

   Then The Blessed One, during the last watch of the night, thought
over Dependent Origination both forward and back:--On ignorance depends
karma. . . . Thus does this entire aggregation of misery arise. But on
the complete fading out and cessation of ignorance ceases karma. . . .
Thus does this entire aggregation of misery cease.

Bo-tree.</span>

   Then The Blessed One, after the lapse of seven days, arose from that
state of exalted calm, and leaving the foot of the Bo-tree, drew near to
where the Ajapâla (that is, the Goatherd's) banyan-tree was; and having
drawn near, he sat cross-legged at the foot of the Ajapâla banyan-tree
for seven days together, experiencing the bliss of emancipation.

   Then a certain Brahman, who was of a proud and contemptuous
disposition, drew near to where The Blessed One

|                                 |                                                 |

was; and having drawn near, he exchanged greetings with The Blessed One.
And having passed with him the greetings of friendship and civility, he
stood respectfully at one side. And standing respectfully at one side,
the Brahman spoke to The Blessed One as follows:--

   "Gotama, what is it constitutes a Brahman? and what are the
Brahman-making qualities?"

   Then The Blessed One, concerning this, on that occasion, breathed
forth this solemn utterance,--

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"The Brahman who his evil traits hath banished,<br />
Is free from pride, is self-restrained and spotless,<br />
Is learned, and the holy life hath followed,<br />
'T is he alone may claim the name of Brahman;<br />
With things of earth he hath no point of contact."<br />

Ajapâla-tree.</span>

   Then The Blessed One, after the lapse of seven days, arose from that
state of exalted calm, and leaving the foot of the Ajapâla banyan-tree,
drew near to where the Mucalinda tree was; and having drawn near, he sat
cross-legged at the foot of the Mucalinda tree for seven days together,
experiencing the bliss of emancipation.

   Now at that time a great cloud appeared out of season, and for seven
days it was rainy, cloudy weather, with a cold wind. Then issued
Mucalinda, the serpent-king, from his abode, and enveloping the body of
The Blessed One seven times with his folds, spread his great hood above
his head, saying,--

   "Let neither cold nor heat, nor gnats, flies, wind, sunshine, nor
creeping creatures come near The Blessed One!"

   Then, when seven days had elapsed, and Mucalinda, the serpent-king,
knew that the storm had broken up, and that the clouds had gone, he
unwound his coils from the body of The Blessed One. And changing his
natural appearance into that of a young man, he stood before The Blessed
One, and with his joined hands to his forehead did reverence to The
Blessed One.
