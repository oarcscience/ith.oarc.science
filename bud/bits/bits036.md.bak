§ 36. BIRTH ETC.

<span class="small">Translated from the Visuddhi-Magga (chap.
xvii.).</span>

   The definitions of birth etc. in the last two propositions of
Dependent Origination are to be understood as above expounded in the
Exposition of the Four Truths; but by existence is here meant only
karma-existence. For that and not originating-existence is the
dependence of birth. Moreover it is its dependence in only one of two
ways, namely, as karma-dependence or as proximate dependence.

   If it be asked in this connection, "But how do we know that existence
is the dependence of birth?" we answer, "Because

differences in respect of meanness, greatness, etc. are apparent, even
when the external dependence remains the same. For even when the
external dependence, such as the seed, blood, food, etc., of father and
mother are the same, differences of meanness, greatness, etc. in the
progeny are observable, and that even in the case of twins. And these
differences are due to a cause, for some do not have these differences;
but these differences can have no other cause than karma, from the
non-existence of any other instrumentality for the purpose in the
sequence of beings who show these differences. Thus they have only
karma-existence as their cause. Karma is indeed the cause for the
difference in beings as regards meanness, greatness, etc. Therefore has
The Blessed One said:--" Karma allots beings to meanness or greatness."
Therefore is it to be understood that existence is the dependence of
birth.

   But inasmuch as when there is no birth there is no old age or death,
nor those other elements of being, sorrow and the rest; and on the other
hand when there is birth, then, to the fool who is afflicted with the
misery called old age and death, occur the sorrow and the rest that are
associated with old age and death; and also to the fool who is afflicted
with this or that other misery do they occur, but not so associated;
therefore is it to be understood of birth that it is the dependence both
of old age and death and of sorrow etc. But it is their dependence by
the proximate dependence alone.

   This is the full discussion of the propositions, "On existence
depends birth," etc.
