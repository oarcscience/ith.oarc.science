§ 80. CONDUCT.

<span class="small">Translated from the Anguttara-Nikâya
(iii.88).</span>

   And what, O priests, is the discipline in elevated conduct?

   Whenever, O priests, a priest is correct in his conduct, and lives
restrained by the restraints of the Pâtimokkha, is exemplary in his
habits and associations, and afraid of even the smallest fault, and
adopts and disciplines himself in the precepts, this, O priests, is
called the discipline in elevated conduct.
