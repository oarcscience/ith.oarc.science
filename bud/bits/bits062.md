§ 62. BEAUTY IS BUT SKIN-DEEP.

\[THE IMPURITIES.\]

<span class="small"><span id="62a">§ 62 *a*.--Translated from the
Visuddhi-Magga (chap. i.).</span></span>

   *With his eye he sees forms*:--He sees forms with his
eye-consciousness, which is able to see forms, and which is called by
the name of its instrument, the eye. As the ancients have said, "The eye
does not see forms, inasmuch as it is not the mind, and the mind does
not see forms, inasmuch as it is not the eye. But when the object of
sense meets the organ of sense, a person sees with the mind by means of
the sensitiveness of the eye." The phrase to "see with the eye" makes
mention only of the instrument, as when it is said, "He wounds with his
bow." Accordingly, the sense is, with his eye-consciousness he sees
forms.

   *But takes no note of signs*:--Either signs of femininity, or of
masculinity, or of sensuous beauty, or of anything else calculated to
arouse the passions, but stops short at what he sees.

   *Nor of minor tokens*:--He takes no note of a person's hand, or foot,
or smile, or laugh, or conversation, or looking, or gazing, or other
personal characteristics called "tokens," because they betoken and
reveal the passions. Only that which is real does he note, as did the
elder Mahâ-Tissa, the hermit of Mt. Cetiya.

   The story is that a certain woman had married into a family of rank,
but had quarreled with her husband, and, decked and ornamented, until
she looked like a goddess, had issued forth from Anurâdhapura, early in
the morning, and was returning home to her family. On her way she met
the elder, as he was on his way from Mt. Cetiya to go on his
begging-rounds in Anurâdhapura. And no sooner had she seen him, than the
perversity of her nature caused her to laugh loudly. The elder looked up
inquiringly, and observing

</td>

   Then came her husband, following in her footsteps, and seeing the
elder, he said:

   "Reverend sir, have you seen a woman pass this way?"

   And the elder said:

Visuddhi-Magga (chap. vi.).</span></span>

   For as the body when dead is repulsive, so is it also when alive; but
on account of the concealment afforded by an adventitious adornment, its
repulsiveness escapes notice. The body is in reality a collection of
over three hundred bones, and is framed into a whole by means of one
hundred and eighty joints. It is held together by nine hundred tendons,
and overlaid by nine hundred muscles, and has an outside envelope of
moist cuticle covered by an epidermis full of pores, through which there
is an incessant oozing and trickling, as if from a kettle of fat. It is
a prey to vermin, the seat of disease, and subject to all manner of
miseries. Through its nine apertures it is always discharging matter,
like a ripe boil. Matter is secreted from the two eyes, wax from the
ears, snot from the nostrils, and from the mouth issue food, bile,
phlegm, and blood, and from the two lower orifices of the body faeces
and urine, while from the ninety-nine thousand pores of the skin an
unclean sweat exudes attracting black flies and other insects.

|                                   |                                     |

   Were even a king in triumphal progress to neglect the use of
tooth-sticks, mouth-rinses, anointings of the head, baths and inner and
outside garments, and other means for beautifying the person, he would
become as uncouth and unkempt as the moment he was born, and would in no
wise differ in bodily offensiveness from the low-caste candâla whose
occupation it is to remove dead flowers. Thus in respect of its
uncleanness, malodor, and disgusting offensiveness, the person of a king
does not differ from that of a candâla. However, when, with the help of
tooth-sticks, mouth-rinses, and various ablutions, men have cleansed
their teeth, and the rest of their persons, and with manifold garments
have covered their nakedness, and have anointed themselves with
many-colored and fragrant unguents, and adorned themselves with flowers
and ornaments, they find themselves able to believe in an "I" and a
"mine." Accordingly, it is on account of the concealment afforded by
this adventitious adornment that people fail to recognize the essential
repulsiveness of their bodies, and that men find pleasure in women, and
women in men. In reality, however, there is not the smallest just reason
for being pleased.

   A proof of this is the fact that when any part of the body becomes
detached, as, for instance, the hair of the head, hair of the body,
nails, teeth, phlegm, snot, faeces, or urine, people are unwilling so
much as to touch it, and are distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe it.
But in respect of what remains, though that is likewise repulsive, yet
men are so wrapped in blindness and infatuated by a passionate fondness
for their own selves, that they believe it to be something desirable,
lovely, lasting, pleasant, and an Ego.

   In this they resemble the old jackal of the forest, who supposes each
flower on a kimsuka tree to be a piece of meat, until disconcerted by
its falling from the tree.

   Therefore,

<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">

   Therefore the undisciplined priest must acquire the mental reflex
wherever he can, wherever an impurity appears, be it in a living body or
in one that is dead, and thus bring his meditation to the stage of
attainment-concentration.
