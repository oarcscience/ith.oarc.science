§ 47. REBIRTH IS NOT TRANSMIGRATION.

<span class="small"><span id="47a">§ 47 *a*.--Translated from the
Milindapañha (7l<sup>16</sup>).</span></span>

   Said the king: "Bhante Nâgasena, does rebirth take place without
anything transmigrating \[passing over\]?"

   "Yes, your majesty. Rebirth takes place without anything
transmigrating."

   "How, bhante Nâgasena, does rebirth take place without anything
transmigrating? Give an illustration."

   "Suppose, your majesty, a man were to light a light from another
light; pray, would the one light have passed over \[transmigrated\] to
the other light?"

   "Nay, verily, bhante."

   "In exactly the same way, your majesty, does rebirth take place
without anything transmigrating."

   "Give another illustration."

   "Do you remember, your majesty, having learnt, when you were a boy,
some verse or other from your professor of poetry?"

   "Yes, bhante."

   "Pray, your majesty, did the verse pass over \[transmigrate\] to you
from your teacher?"

   "Nay, verily, bhante."

   "In exactly the same way, your majesty, does rebirth take place
without anything transmigrating."

   "You are an able man, bhante Nâgasena."

 

<span class="small"><span id="47b">§ 47 *b*.--Translated from the
Milindapañha (46<sup>5</sup>).</span></span>

   "Bhante Nâgasena," said the king, "what is it that is born into the
next existence?"

   "Your majesty," said the elder, "it is name and form that is born
into the next existence."

   "Is it this same name and form that is born into the next existence?"

   "Your majesty, it is not this same name and form that is born into
the next existence; but with this name and

|                                   |                                                 |

| <span id="page_235">p. 235</span> | <span class="small">\[Mil.46<sup>9</sup></span> |

form, your majesty, one does a deed--it may be good, or it may be
wicked--and by reason of this deed another name and form is born into
the next existence."

   "Bhante, if it is not this same name and form that is born into the
next existence, is one not freed from one's evil deeds?"

   "If one were not born into another existence," said the elder, "one
would be freed from one's evil deeds; but, your majesty, inasmuch as one
is born into another existence, therefore is one not freed from one's
evil deeds."

   "Give an illustration."

   "Your majesty, it is as if a man were to take away another man's
mangoes, and the owner of the mangoes were to seize him, and show him to
the king, and say, 'Sire, this man hath taken away my mangoes;' and the
other were to say, 'Sire, I did not take away this man's mangoes. The
mangoes which this man planted were different mangoes from those which I
took away. I am not liable to punishment.' Pray, your majesty, would the
man be liable to punishment?"

   "Assuredly, bhante, would he be liable to punishment."

   "For what reason?"

   "Because, in spite of what he might say, he would be liable to
punishment for the reason that the last mangoes derived from the first
mangoes."

   "In exactly the same way, your majesty, with this name and form one
does a deed--it may be good, or it may be wicked--and by reason of this
deed another name and form is born into the next existence. Therefore is
one not freed from one's evil deeds."

   "Give another illustration."

   "Your majesty, it is as if a man were to take away the rice of
another man, . . . were to take away the sugar-cane, . . . Your majesty,
it is as if a man were to light a fire in the winter-time and warm
himself, and were to go off without putting it out. And then the fire
were to burn another man's field, and the owner of the field were to
seize him, and show him to the king, and say, 'Sire, this man has burnt
up

|                                   |                                                 |

my field;' and the other were to say, 'Sire, I did not set this man's
field on fire. The fire which I failed to put out was a different one
from the one which has burnt up this man's field. I am not liable to
punishment.' Pray, your majesty, would the man be liable to punishment?"

   "Assuredly, bhante, would he be liable to punishment."

   "For what reason?"

   "Because, in spite of what he might say, the man would be liable to
punishment for the reason that the last fire derived from the first
fire."

   "In exactly the same way, your majesty, with this name and form one
does a deed--it may be good, or it may be wicked--and by reason of this
deed another name and form is born into the next existence. Therefore is
one not freed from one's evil deeds."

   "Give another illustration.'

   "Your majesty, it is as if a man were to ascend to the top storey of
a house with a light, and eat there; and the light in burning were to
set fire to the thatch; and the thatch in burning were to set fire to
the house; and the house in burning were to set fire to the village; and
the people of the village were to seize him, and say, 'Why, O man, did
you set fire to the village?' and he were to say, 'I did not set fire to
the village. The fire of the lamp by whose light I ate was a different
one from the one which set fire to the village;' and they, quarreling,
were to come to you. Whose cause, your majesty, would you sustain?"

   "That of the people of the village, bhante."

   "And why?"

   "Because, in spite of what the man might say, the latter fire sprang
from the former."

   "In exactly the same way, your majesty, although the name and form
which is born into the next existence is different from the name and
form which is to end at death, nevertheless, it is sprung from it.
Therefore is one not freed from one's evil deeds."

   "Give another illustration."

   "Your majesty, it is as if a man were to choose a young

girl in marriage, and having paid the purchase-money, were to go off;
and she subsequently were to grow up and become marriageable; and then
another man were to pay the purchase-money for her, and marry her; and
the first man were to return, and say, 'O man, why did you marry my
wife?' and the other were to say, 'I did not marry your wife. The young,
tender girl whom you chose in marriage, and for whom you paid
purchase-money, was a different person from this grown-up and
marriageable girl whom I have chosen in marriage, and for whom I have
paid purchase-money;' and they, quarreling, were to come to you. Whose
cause, your majesty, would you sustain?"

   "That of the first man."

   "And why?"

   "Because, in spite of what the second man might say, the grown-up
girl sprang from the other."

   "In exactly the same way, your majesty, although the name and form
which is born into the next existence is different from the name and
form which is to end at death, nevertheless, it is sprung from it.
Therefore is one not freed from one's evil deeds."

   "Give another illustration."

   "Your majesty, it is as if a man were to buy from a cowherd a pot of
milk, and were to leave it with the cowherd, and go off, thinking he
would come the next day and take it. And on the next day it were to turn
into sour cream; and the man were to come back, and say, 'Give me the
pot of milk.' And the other were to show him the sour cream; and the
first man were to say, 'I did not buy sour cream from you. Give me the
pot of milk.' And the cowherd were to say, 'While you were gone, your
milk turned into sour cream;' and they, quarreling, were to come to you.
Whose cause, your majesty, would you sustain?"

   "That of the cowherd, bhante."

   "And why?"

   "Because, in spite of what the man might say, the one sprang from the
other."

name and form which is born into the next existence is different from
the name and form which is to end at death, nevertheless, it is sprung
from it. therefore is one not freed from one's evil deeds."

   "You are an able man, bhante Nâgasena,"

 

<span class="small"><span id="47c">§ 47 *c*--Translated from the
Visuddhi-Magga (chap. xvii.).</span></span>

    It is only elements of being possessing a dependence that arrive at
a new existence: none transmigrated from the last existence, nor are
they in the new existence without causes contained in the old, By this
is said that it is only elements of being, with form or without, but
possessing a dependence, that arrive at a new existence. There is no
entity, no living principle; no elements of being transmigrated from the
last existence into the present one; nor, on the other hand, do they
appear in the present existence without causes in that one, This we will
now make plain by considering birth and death as they occur every day
among men.

   For when, in any existence, one arrives at the gate of death, either
in the natural course of things or through violence; and when, by a
concourse of intolerable, death-dealing pains, all the members, both
great and small, are loosened and wrenched apart in every joint and
ligament; and the body, like a green palm-leaf exposed to the sun, dries
up by degrees; and the eye-sight and the other senses fail; and the
power of feeling, and the power of thinking, and vitality are making the
last stand in the heart--then consciousness residing in that last
refuge, the heart, continues to exist by virtue of karma, otherwise
called the predispositions. This karma, however, still retains something
of what it depends on, and consists of such former deeds as were
weighty, much practised, and are now close at hand; or else this karma
creates a reflex of itself or of the new mode of life now being entered
upon, and it is with this as its object that consciousness continues to
exist.

   Now while the consciousness still subsists, inasmuch as

|                                   |                                       |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_239">p. 239</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xvii</span> |

desire and ignorance have not been abandoned and the evil of the object
is hidden by that ignorance, desire inclines the consciousness to the
object; and the karma that sprang up along with the consciousness impels
it toward the object. This consciousness being in its series thus
inclined toward the object by desire, and impelled toward it by karma,
like a man who swings himself over a ditch by means of a rope hanging
from a tree on the hither bank, quits its first resting-place and
continues to subsist in dependence on objects of sense and other things,
and either does or does not light on another resting-place created by
karma. Here the former consciousness, from its passing out of existence,
is called passing away, and the latter, from its being reborn into a new
existence, is called rebirth. But it is to be understood that this
latter consciousness did not come to the present existence from the
previous one, and also that it is only to causes contained in the old
existence,--namely, to karma called the predispositions, to inclination,
an object, etc.,--that its present appearance is due.

   *As illustrations* of how consciousness does not come over from the
last existence into the present, and how it springs up by means of
causes belonging to the former existence, *here may serve echoes*,
light, the impressions of a seal, and reflections in a mirror. For as
echoes, light, the impressions of a seal, and shadows have sound etc.
for their causes, and exist without having come from elsewhere, just so
is it with this mind.

   Moreover

For if, in a continuous series, an absolute sameness obtained, then
could sour cream not arise from milk; while, on the

|                                   |                                       |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_240">p. 240</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xvii</span> |

other hand, if there were an absolute diversity, then could not a
milk-owner obtain sour cream. The same argument holds good in regard to
all causes and effects. This being so, it would be more correct not to
use the popular mode of stating the case, but that would not be
desirable. Therefore, we must merely guard ourselves from supposing that
there is here either an absolute sameness or an absolute diversity. Here
some one will say,

   "This explanation is not a good one. For is it not true that if there
be no transmigration, and both the Groups and the fruitful karma which
belong to this existence in the world of men cease, nor arrive in the
new existence, the fruit of this karma would then be borne by a
different thing from that which produced the karma itself? If the reaper
ceased to exist, it would not be he experienced the fruit. Therefore
this position is not good."

   The following quotation will answer this:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"The series which doth bear a fruit,<br />
Is not the same nor something else.<br />
The fabricating power in seeds<br />
Will show the meaning of this word."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   For when the *fruit* arises in a *series*, as absolute sameness and
absolute diversity are both excluded, it cannot be said that the fruit
is borne by the *same* thing *nor* yet by *something else*.

   *The fabricating power in seeds will show this*. For when the
fabricating power in the seed of mangoes and other plants operate,
inasmuch as any particular kind of fruit is dependent on the previous
part of its series, it cannot come from other seeds, nor in dependence
on other fabricating powers; nor yet is it those other seeds, or those
other fabricating powers, which arrive at fruition. Such is to be
understood to be the nature of the present case. Also when education,
training, and medicaments have been applied to the body of a young
person, the fruit will appear in after time in the mature body etc. Thus
is the sense to be understood.

|                                   |                                       |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_241">p. 241</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xvii</span> |

   Now as to what was said, "If the reaper ceased to exist, it would not
be he experienced the fruit," consider the following:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"As when 't is said, 'The tree bears fruit,'<br />
As soon as fruit on it appears;<br />
Just so the Groups are reapers called,<br />
As soon as karma's fruit springs up."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   Just as in the case of those elements of being which go under the
name of tree, as soon as at any point the fruit springs up, *it is* then
*said*, "*The tree bears fruit*," or, "The tree has fructified"--so also
in the case of those *Groups* which go under the name of "god" or "man,"
when a fruition of happiness or misery springs up at any point, then it
is said, "That god or man is happy or miserable." Therefore is it that
we have here no need of any other *reaper*.

 

<span class="small"><span id="47d">§ 47 *d*.--Translated from the
Visuddhi-Magga (chap. xvii.).</span></span>

   He, then, that has no clear idea of death and does not master the
fact that death everywhere consists in the dissolution of the Groups, he
comes to a variety of conclusions, such as, "A living entity dies and
transmigrates into another body."

   He that has no clear idea of rebirth and does not master the fact
that the appearance of the Groups everywhere constitutes rebirth, he
comes to a variety of conclusions, such as, "A living entity is born and
has obtained a new body."

 

<span class="small"><span id="47e">§ 47 *e*.--Translated from the
Visuddhi-Magga (chap. xxi.).</span></span>

   Therefore have the ancients said:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"'The Groups break up, and only they,' the wise say,<br />
'And death consisteth in their dissolution.'<br />
The thoughtful man of insight sees them vanish;<br />
They're like the jewel shattered by the diamond."<br />
