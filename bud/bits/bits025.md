§ 25. THE MIDDLE DOCTRINE.

<span class="small"><span id="25a">§ 25 *a*.--Translated from the
Samyutta-Nikâya (xxii.90<sup>16</sup>).</span></span>

   The world, for the most pard, O Kaccâna, holds either to a belief in
being or to a belief in non-being. But for one who in the light of the
highest knowledge, O Kaccâna, considers how the world arises, belief in
the non-being of the world passes away. And for one who in the light of
the highest knowledge, O Kaccâna, considers how the world ceases, belief
in the being of the world passes away. The world, O Kaccâna, is for the
most part bound up in a seeking attachment, and proclivity \[for the
groups\], but a priest does not sympathize with this seeking and
attachment, nor with the mental affirmation, proclivity, and prejudice
which affirms an Ego. He does not doubt or question that it is only evil
that springs into existence, and only evil that ceases from existence,
and his conviction of this fact is dependent on no one besides himself.
This, O Kaccâna, is what constitutes Right Belief.

   That things have being, O Kaccâna, constitutes one extreme of
doctrine; that things have no being is the other extreme. These
extremes, O Kaccâna, have been avoided by The Tathâgata, and it is a
middle doctrine he teaches:--

   Thus have I heard.

   On a certain occasion The Blessed One was dwelling at Sâvatthi in
Jetavana monastery in Anâthapindka's Park. And there The Blessed One
addressed the priests.

|                                   |                                                   |

   "Priests," said he.

   "Lord," said the priests to The Blessed One in reply. And The Blessed
One spoke as follows:

   "O priests, on ignorance depends karma. . . . Thus does this entire
aggregation of misery arise."

   "Reverend Sir, what are old age and death? and what is it has old age
and death?"

   "The question is not rightly put," said The Blessed One.

   "O priest, to say: 'What are old age and death? and what is it has
old age and death?' and to say: 'Old age and death are one thing, but it
is another thing which has old age and death,' is to say the same thing
in different ways. If, O priest, the dogma obtain that the soul and the
body are identical, then there is no religious life; or if, O priest,
the dogma obtain that the soul is one thing and the body another, then
also there is no religious life. Both these extremes, O priest, have
been avoided by The Tathâgata, and it is a middle doctrine he teaches:
'On birth depend old age and death.'"

   "Reverend Sir, what is birth? and what is it has birth?"

   "The question is not rightly put," said The Blessed One.

   "O priest, to say: 'What is birth? and what is it has birth?' and to
say: 'Birth is one thing, but it is another thing which has birth,' is
to say the same thing in different ways. If, O priest, the dogma obtain
that the soul and the body are identical, then there is no religious
life; or if, O priest, the dogma obtain that the soul is one thing and
the body another, then also there is no religious life. Both these
extremes, O priest, have been avoided by The Tathâgata, and it is a
middle doctrine he teaches: 'On existence depends birth.'"

   "Reverend Sir, what is existence? . . . attachment? . . . desire? . .
. sensation? . . . contact? . . . the six organs of sense? . . . name
and form? . . . consciousness? . . . karma? and what is it has karma?"

   "The question is not rightly put," said The Blessed One.

   "O priest, to say: 'What is karma? and what is it has karma?' and to
say: 'Karma is one thing, but it is another thing which has karma,' is
to say the same thing in different

ways. If, O priest, the dogma obtain that the soul and the body are
identical, then there is no religious life; or if, O priest, the dogma
obtain that the soul is one thing and the body another, then also there
is no religious life. Both these extremes, O priest, have been avoided
by The Tathâgata, and it is a middle doctrine he teaches: 'On ignorance
depends karma.'

   "But on the complete fading out and cessation of ignorance, O priest,
all these refuges, puppet-shows, resorts, and writhings,--to wit: What
are old age and death? and what is it has old age and death? or, old age
and death are one thing, but it is another thing which has old age and
death; or, the soul and the body are identical, or the soul is one
thing, and the body another,--all such refuges of whatever kind are
abandoned, uprooted, pulled out of the ground like a palmyra-tree, and
become non-existent and not liable to spring up again in the future.

Visuddhi-Magga (chap. xvii.).</span></span>

Inasmuch as it is dependently on each other and in unison and
simultaneously that the factors which constitute dependence originate
the elements of being, therefore did The Sage call these factors
Dependent Origination.

For the ignorance etc. which have been enumerated as constituting
dependence, when they originate any of the elements of being, namely,
karma and the rest, can only do so when dependent on each other and in
case none of their number

|                                   |                                       |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_169">p. 169</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xvii</span> |

is lacking. Therefore it is dependently on each other and in unison and
simultaneously that the factors which constitute dependence originate
the elements of being, not by a part of their number nor by one
succeeding the other. Accordingly The Sage, skilful in the art of
discovering the signification of things, calls this dependence by the
name of Dependent Origination.

   And in so doing, by the first of these two words is shown the falsity
of such heresies as that of the persistence of existences, and by the
second word, a rejection of such heresies as that existences cease to
be, while by both together is shown the truth.

   *By the first*:--The word "Dependent," as exhibiting a full
complement of dependence and inasmuch as the elements of being are
subject to that full complement of dependence, shows an avoidance of
such heresies as that of the persistence of existences, the heresies,
namely, of the persistence of existences, of uncaused existences, of
existences due to an overruling power, of self-determining existences.
For what have persistent existences, uncaused existences, etc., to do
with a full complement of dependence?

   *By the second word*:--The word "Origination," as exhibiting an
origination of the elements of being and inasmuch as the elements of
being originate by means of a full complement of dependence, shows a
rejection of such heresies as that of the annihilation of existences,
the heresies, namely, of the annihilation of existences, of nihilism, of
the inefficacy of karma. For if the elements of being are continually
originating by means of an antecedent dependence, whence can we have
annihilation of existence, nihilism, and an inefficacy of karma?

   *By both together*:--By the complete phrase "Dependent Origination,"
inasmuch as such and such elements of being come into existence by means
of an unbroken series of their full complement of dependence, the truth,
or middle course, is shown. This rejects the heresy that he who
experiences the fruit of the deed is the same as the one who performed
the deed, and also rejects the converse one that he who

|                                   |                                       |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_170">p. 170</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xvii</span> |

experiences the fruit of a deed is different from the one who performed
the deed, and leaning not to either of these popular hypotheses, holds
fast by nominalism.
