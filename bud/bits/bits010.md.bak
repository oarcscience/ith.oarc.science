§ 10. THE CONVERSION OF SÂRIPUTTA AND MOGGALLÂNA.<span

<span class="small">Translated from the Mahâ-Vagga

   N<span class="small">OW</span> at that time, Sañjaya, the wandering
ascetic, was dwelling at Râjagaha in company with a large following of
wandering ascetics, two hundred and fifty in number; and at that time
Sâriputta and Moggallâna were leading the religious life under Sañjaya,
the wandering ascetic. And they had made this compact: "That one of us
who shall first attain to the deathless is to tell it to the other."

   Then the venerable Assaji, having put on his tunic in the morning and
taken his bowl and his robes, entered Râjagaha for alms, winning the
minds of men with his advancing and his retiring, with his looking and
his gazing, with his drawing in his arms and his stretching out his
arms, and having his eyes cast down, and perfect in his deportment. And
Sâriputta, the wandering ascetic, saw the venerable Assaji going the
rounds of Râjagaha for alms, winning the minds of men with his advancing
and his retiring, with his looking and

his gazing, with his drawing in his arms and his stretching out his
arms, and having his eyes cast down, and perfect in his deportment. And
when he had seen him, it occurred to him as follows:--

   "This must be a priest who is either a saint already, or has entered
the path which conducts to saintship. What if now I draw near to this
priest, and ask him, 'To follow whom, brother, did you retire from the
world? Who is your teacher? and whose doctrine do you approve?'"

   Then it occurred to Sâriputta, the wandering ascetic, as follows:--

   "It is not a fit time to ask this priest questions while he is inside
the city, and going the rounds for alms. What if now I follow in the
wake of this priest in the manner approved of for those who have
requests to prefer?"

   Then the venerable Assaji, after he had gone the rounds of Râjagaha
and obtained alms, issued from the city; and Sâriputta, the wandering
ascetic, drew near to where the venerable Assaji was; and having drawn
near, he exchanged greetings with the venerable Assaji; and having
passed with him the greetings of friendship and civility, he stood
respectfully at one side. And standing respectfully at one side,
Sâriputta, the wandering ascetic, spoke to the venerable Assaji as
follows:--

   "Placid, brother, are all your organs of sense; clear and bright is
the color of your skin. To follow whom, brother, did you retire from the
world? Who is your teacher? and whose doctrine do you approve?"

   "Brother, there is a great Sakyaputta monk, one who has retired from
the world out of the Sakya clan. To follow this Blessed One have I
retired from the world, and this Blessed One is my teacher, and the
Doctrine of this Blessed One do I approve."

   "But what, venerable sir, is your teacher's doctrine? and what does
he proclaim?"

   "Brother, I am a novice and a new-comer, and the time is but short
since I retired from the world under this Doctrine and Discipline. I am
not able to expound to you the Doctrine

|                                 |                                                  |
|:--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_89">p. 89</span> | <span class="small">\[MV.i.23<sup>4</sup></span> |

at any great length, but I can tell you the substance of it in brief."

   Then Sâriputta, the wandering ascetic, spoke to the venerable Assaji
as follows:--

   "So be it, brother. Whether little or much, tell it me. Tell me only
the substance; it is the substance I want. Why should you make a long
matter of it?"

   Then the venerable Assaji recited to Sâriputta, the wandering
ascetic, the following exposition of the Doctrine:--

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"The Buddha hath the causes told<br />
Of all things springing from a cause;<br />
And also how things cease to be--<br />
'T is this the Mighty Monk proclaims."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   On hearing this exposition of the Doctrine, there arose in the mind
of Sâriputta, the wandering ascetic, a clear and distinct perception of
the Doctrine that whatever is subject to origination is subject also to
cessation." If this is the Doctrine," said he, "then, indeed, have you
reached the sorrowless state lost sight of and neglected for many
myriads of world-cycles."

 

   Then Sâriputta, the wandering ascetic, drew near to where Moggallâna,
the wandering ascetic, was. And Moggallâna, the wandering ascetic, saw
Sâriputta, the wandering ascetic, approaching from afar; and when he had
seen him, he spoke to Sâriputta, the wandering ascetic, as follows:--

   "Placid, brother, are all your organs of sense; clear and bright is
the color of your skin. Brother, have you attained to the deathless?"

   "Yea, brother, I have attained to the deathless."

   "But how, brother, did you attain to the deathless?"

   "Brother, just now I saw Assaji the priest going the rounds of
Râjagaha for alms, winning the minds of men with his advancing and his
retiring, with his looking and his gazing, with his drawing in his arms
and his stretching out his arms, and having his eyes cast down, and
perfect in his deportment; and when I had seen him, it occurred to me as
follows:--

|                                 |                                                  |

   "This must be a priest who is either a saint already, or has entered
the path which conducts to saintship. What if now I were to draw near to
this priest, and ask him, 'To follow whom, brother, did you retire from
the world? Who is your Teacher? and whose doctrine do you approve?'
Then, brother, it occurred to me as follows: 'It is not a fit time to
ask this priest questions while he is inside the city and going the
round for alms. What if now I follow in the wake of this priest in the
manner approved of for those who have requests to prefer?' Then,
brother, Assaji the priest, after he had gone the rounds of Râjagaha and
obtained alms, issued from the city; and I, brother, drew near to where
Assaji the priest was; and having drawn near, I exchanged greetings with
the venerable Assaji; and having passed with him the greetings of
friendship and civility, I stood respectfully at one side. And standing
respectfully at one side, I spoke, brother, to the venerable Assaji as
follows: 'Placid, brother, are all your organs of sense; clear and
bright is the color of your skin. To follow whom, brother, did you
retire from the world? Who is your teacher? and whose doctrine do you
approve?' 'Brother, there is a great Sakyaputta monk, one who has

have I retired from the world, and this Blessed One is my teacher, and

tell it me. Tell me only the substance; it is the substance I want. Why
should you make a long matter of it?' Then, brother, Assaji the priest
recited to me the following exposition of the Doctrine:--
