§ 23. THE ORIGIN AND CESSATION OF THE HUMAN BEING.

<span class="small"><span id="23a">§ 23 *a*.--Translated from the
Samyutta-Nikâya (xxii.22<sup>1</sup>).</span></span>

   Thus have I heard.

   On a certain occasion The Blessed One was dwelling at Sâvatthi in
Jetavana monastery in Anâthapindika's Park. And there The Blessed One
addressed the priests.

   "Priests," said he.

   "Lord," said the priests to The Blessed One in reply. And The Blessed
One spoke as follows:--

   "I will teach you, O priests, the burden, the bearer of the

burden, the taking up of the burden, and the laying down of the burden.

   "And what, O priests, is the burden?

   "Reply should be made that it is the five attachment-groups. And what
are the five? They are: the form-attachment-group, the
sensation-attachment-group, the perception-attachment-group, the
predisposition-attachment-group, the consciousness-attachment-group.
These, O priests, are called the burden.

   "And who, O priests, is the bearer of the burden?

   "Reply should be made that it is the individual; the venerable
So-and-so of such-and-such a family. He, O priests, is called the bearer
of the burden.

   "And what, O priests, is the taking up of the burden?

   "It is desire leading to rebirth, joining itself to pleasure and
passion, and finding delight in every existence,--desire, namely, for
sensual pleasure, desire for permanent existence, desire for transitory
existence.<span id="page_160_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_160_note_1) This, O priests, is
called the taking up of the burden.

   "And what, O priests, is the laying down of the burden?

   "It is the complete absence of passion, the cessation, giving up,
relinquishment, forsaking, and non-adoption of desire. This, O priests,
is called the laying down of the burden."

   Thus spake The Blessed One; and when The Happy One had so spoken, The
Teacher afterwards spoke as follows:--

   Thus have I heard.

   On a certain occasion The Blessed One was dwelling at Sâvatthi in
Jetavana monastery in Anâthapindika's Park. Then drew near a certain
priest to where The Blessed One was; and having drawn near and greeted
The Blessed One, he sat down respectfully at one side. And seated
respectfully at one side, the priest spoke to The Blessed One as
follows:

   "Pray, Reverend Sir, let The Blessed One teach me the Doctrine in
brief, so that when I have listened to the Doctrine of The Blessed One I
may dwell solitary, retired, vigilant, strenuous, and earnest."

   "By cleaving to anything, O priest, thus does one come to be; by not
cleaving to anything, thus does one not come to be."

   "I understand, O Blessed One! I understand, O Happy One!"

   "But what, O priest, do you understand is the full meaning of what I
said in brief?"

   "By cleaving to form, Reverend Sir, thus does one come to be. By
cleaving to sensation, . . . perception, . . . the predispositions, . .
. consciousness, thus does one come to be. By not cleaving to form,
Reverend Sir, thus does one not come to be. By not cleaving to
sensation, . . . perception, . . . the predispositions, . . .
consciousness, thus does one not come to be. This is what I understand
to be the full meaning of what The Blessed One said in brief."

   "Well said, well said, O priest! Well do you understand the full
meaning of what I said in brief. By cleaving to form, O priest, thus
does one come to be. By cleaving to sensation, . . . perception, . . .
the predispositions, . . . consciousness, thus does one come to be. By
not cleaving to form, O priest, thus does one not come to be. By not
cleaving to sensation, . . . perception, . . . the predispositions, . .
. consciousness, thus does one not come to be. This, O priest, is the
full meaning of what I said in brief." Then that priest, having
applauded the speech of The

Blessed One and returned thanks, rose from his seat, and saluting The
Blessed One and keeping his right side towards him, he departed.

   Then that priest, solitary, retired, vigilant, strenuous, and
earnest, in no long time, and in his life-time, came to learn for
himself, realize, and live in the possession of that highest good to
which the holy life conducts, and for the sake of which youths of good
family so nobly retire from the household life to the houseless one. And
he became conscious that rebirth was exhausted, that he had lived the
holy life, that he had done what it behooved him to do, and that he was
no more for this world.

   And that priest was of the number of the saints.

   "Priests," said he.

   "Lord," said the priests to The Blessed One in reply. And The Blessed
One spoke as follows:--

   "Not to seek for anything, O priests, is to be free; to seek for
anything is not to be free.

   "If consciousness abide, O priests, it is because of a seeking for
form that it abides, and supported by form, and resting in form, and
taking delight therein, it attains to growth, increase, and development.
When consciousness abides, O priests, it is because of a seeking for
sensation, . . . perception, . . . the predispositions, that it abides,
and supported by the predispositions, and resting in the
predispositions, and taking delight therein, it attains to growth,
increase, and development.

   "It is impossible, O priests, for any one to say that he can declare
either the coming, or the going, or the passing out of an existence, or
the springing up into an existence, or the growth, or the increase, or
the development of consciousness

apart from form, apart from sensation, apart from perception, apart from
the predispositions.

   "If passion for form, O priests, is abandoned, then through the
abandonment of passion the support is cut off, and there is no
resting-place for consciousness. If passion for sensation, . . . for
perception, . . . for the predispositions is abandoned, then through the
abandonment of passion the support is cut off, and there is no
resting-place for consciousness.

   "When that consciousness has no resting-place, does not increase, and
no longer accumulates karma, it becomes free; and when it is free, it
becomes quiet; and when it is quiet, it is blissful; and when it is
blissful, it is not agitated; and when it is not agitated, it attains
Nirvana in its own person; and it knows that rebirth is exhausted, that
it has lived the holy life, that it has done what it behooved it to do,
and that it is no more for this world."

attachment, mental affirmation, proclivity, and prejudice in respect of
form. Thus will form be abandoned, uprooted, pulled out of the ground
like a palmyra-tree, and become non-existent and not liable to spring up
again in the future.
