Buddhism in Translations

This book was translated and edited by Henry Clarke Warren (1854-1899),
and published in 1896 as Volume III of the *Harvard Oriental Series*. As
such, it (like *The Sacred Books of the East*) suffers from some of the
deficiencies of Victorian-era translations, mainly: intentionally
archaic phrasing (although not as much as is found in many books),
versification that today strikes us as stilted (if not downright bad),
and translations of some Buddhist technical terms that may show a lack
of understanding for the subtleties of Buddhist thought (very notably,
the use of the word 'priest' instead of 'monk' to translate 'bhikku',
which is not at all a subtle distinction) and have been superceded in
more modern translations. Also, it is an anthology of excerpts from
various Pâli sources, and as such, it subjects us to Warren's judgment
as to what is important to read.

All that being said, however, it is still a quite worthwhile book, and a
fine introduction to the vast range of Pâli Buddhist literature. The
translations are of a high quality given their time period, and many of
the excerpts are of good size, including a number of complete texts.
While it may not be suitable for use as devotional text or scholarly
reference, it does have value in its own right. Some of the material
included (especially the excerpts from the Visudddhi Magga) is not
available in any other public domain sources, and at a mere 496 pp. it
is concise introduction to the major ideas of Theravada Buddhism. A
second table of contents for the book has also been provided,
reorganizing the material according to the original sources.
