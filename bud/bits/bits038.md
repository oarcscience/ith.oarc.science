§ 38. BE A FRIEND TO YOURSELF.

<span class="small">Translated from the Samyutta-Nikâya
(iii.1.4<sup>1</sup>).</span>

   Thus have I heard.

   On a certain occasion The Blessed One was dwelling at Sâvatthi, in
Jetavana monastery in Anâthapindika's Park.

   Then drew near king Pasenadi the Kosalan to where The Blessed One
was; and having drawn near and greeted The Blessed One, he sat down
respectfully at one side. And seated respectfully at one side, king
Pasenadi the Kosalan spoke to The Blessed One as follows:--

   "Reverend Sir, it happened to me, as I was just now in seclusion and
plunged in meditation, that a consideration presented itself to my mind,
as follows: 'Who are those who love themselves? and who do not love
themselves?' And, Reverend Sir, it occurred to me as follows: 'All they
who do evil with their body, who do evil with their voice, who do evil
with their mind, they do not love themselves.' And although they should
say thus: 'We love ourselves,' nevertheless, they do not love
themselves. And why do I say so? Because, whatever a man would do to one
whom he did not love, that they do to themselves. Therefore, they do not
love themselves.

   "But all they who do good with their body, who do good with their
voice, who do good with their mind, they love themselves. And although
they should say thus: 'We do not love ourselves,' nevertheless, they do
love themselves. And why do I say so? Because, whatever a man would do
to one whom he loved, that they do to themselves. Therefore, they love
themselves."

   "Thus it is, great king! Thus it is! Certainly, great king, all they
who do evil with their body, who do evil with their voice, who do evil
with their mind, they do not love themselves. And although they should
say thus: 'We love ourselves,' nevertheless, they do not love
themselves. And why do I say so? Because, whatever a man would do to one

whom he did not love, that they do to themselves. Therefore, they do not
love themselves.

   "But all they, great king, who do good with their body, who do good
with their voice, who do good with their mind, they love themselves. And
although they should say thus: 'We do not love ourselves,' nevertheless,
they do love themselves. And why do I say so? Because, whatever a man
