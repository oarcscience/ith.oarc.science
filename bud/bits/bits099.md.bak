§ 99. THE ADMISSION OF WOMEN TO THE ORDER.

<span class="small">Translated from the Culla-Vagga
(x.1<sup>1</sup>).</span>

   At that time The Buddha, The Blessed One, was dwelling among the
Sakkas at Kapilavatthu in Banyan Park. Then drew near Mahâ-Pajâpatî the
Gotamid to where The Blessed One was; and having drawn near and greeted
The Blessed One, she stood respectfully at one side. And standing
respectfully at one side, Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid spoke to The Blessed
One as follows:

   "Pray, Reverend Sir, let women retire from household life to the
houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The
Tathâgata."

   "Enough, O Gotamid, do not ask that women retire from household life
to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The
Tathâgata."

   And a second time Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid spoke to The Blessed One
as follows:

   "Pray, Reverend Sir, let women retire from household life to the
houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The
Tathâgata."

   "Enough, O Gotamid, do not ask that women retire from household life
to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The
Tathâgata."

   And a third time Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid spoke to The Blessed One
as follows:

   "Pray, Reverend Sir, let women retire from household life to the
houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The
Tathâgata."

   "Enough, O Gotamid, do not ask that women retire from household life
to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The
Tathâgata."

   Then thought Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid, "The Blessed One permitteth
not that women retire from household life to the houseless one, under
the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata;" and she was
sorrowful, sad,

|                                   |                                                 |
|:----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------:|

and tearful, and wept. And saluting The Blessed One, and keeping her
right side toward him, she departed.

   Then The Blessed One, after dwelling at Kapilavatthu as long as he
wished, departed on his wanderings toward Vesâlî and wandering from
place to place, he came to where Vesâlî was. And there The Blessed One
dwelt at Vesâlî in Great Wood, in Pagoda Hall.

   Then Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid had her hair cut off, put on yellow
garments, and with a number of Sakka women departed towards Vesâlî and
going from place to place, she drew near to where Vesâlî was, and Great
Wood, and Pagoda Hall. And Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid with swollen feet,
and covered with dust, sorrowful, sad, and tearful, stood weeping
outside in the entrance porch.

   Now the venerable Ânanda saw Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid with swollen
feet, and covered with dust, sorrowful, sad, and tearful, stand weeping
outside in the entrance porch. And he spoke to Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid
as follows:

   "Wherefore dost thou, O Gotamid, with swollen feet, and covered with
dust, sorrowful, sad, and tearful, stand weeping outside in the entrance
porch?"

   "Because, alas! O Ânanda, reverend sir, The Blessed One permitteth
not that women retire from household life to the houseless one, under
the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata."

   "In that case, O Gotamid, stay thou here a moment, and I will beseech
The Blessed One that women retire from household life to the houseless
one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata."

   Then the venerable Ânanda drew near to where The Blessed One was; and
having drawn near and greeted The Blessed One, he sat down respectfully
at one side. And seated respectfully at one side, the venerable Ânanda
spoke to The Blessed One as follows:

   "Reverend Sir, here this Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid with swollen feet,
and covered with dust, sorrowful, sad, and tearful, stands weeping
outside in the entrance porch, and says that The Blessed One permitteth
not that women retire

|                                   |                                                 |
|:----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------:|

from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and
Discipline announced by The Tathâgata. Pray, Reverend Sir, let women
retire from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and
Discipline announced by The Tathâgata."

   "Enough, Ânanda, do not ask that women retire from household life to
the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The
Tathâgata."

   And a second time the venerable Ânanda spoke to The Blessed One as
follows:

   "Pray, Reverend Sir, let women retire from household life to the
houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The
Tathâgata."

   "Enough, Ânanda, do not ask that women retire from household life to
the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The
Tathâgata."

   And a third time the venerable Ânanda spoke to The Blessed One as
follows:

   "Pray, Reverend Sir, let women retire from household life to the
houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The
Tathâgata."

   "Enough, Ânanda, do not ask that women retire from household life to
the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The
Tathâgata."

   Then thought the venerable Ânanda, "The Blessed One permitteth not
that women retire from household life to the houseless one, under the
Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata; what if now, by
another route, I beseech The Blessed One that women retire from
household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline
announced by The Tathâgata?"

   Then the venerable Ânanda spoke to The Blessed One as follows:

   "Are women competent, Reverend Sir, if they retire from household
life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced
by The Tathâgata, to attain to the fruit of conversion, to attain to the
fruit of once returning, to attain to the fruit of never returning, to
attain to saintship?"

|                                   |                                                 |
|:----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_444">p. 444</span> | <span class="small">\[CV.x.1<sup>3</sup></span> |

   "Women are competent, Ânanda, if they retire from household life to
the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The
Tathâgata, to attain to the fruit of conversion, to attain to the fruit
of once returning, to attain to the fruit of never returning, to attain
to saintship."

   "Since, then, Reverend Sir, women are competent, if they retire from
household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline
announced by The Tathâgata, to attain to the fruit of conversion, to
attain to the fruit of once returning, to attain to the fruit of never
returning, to attain to saintship, consider, Reverend Sir, how great a
benefactress Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid has been. She is the sister of
the mother of The Blessed One, and as foster-mother, nurse, and giver of
milk, she suckled The Blessed One on the death of his mother. Pray,
Reverend Sir, let women retire from household life to the houseless one,
under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata."

   "If, Ânanda, Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid will accept eight weighty
regulations, let it be reckoned to her as her ordination:--

   "A priestess of even a hundred years' standing shall salute, rise to
meet, entreat humbly, and perform all respectful offices for a priest,
even if he be but that day ordained. This regulation shall be honored,
esteemed, revered, and worshiped, and is not to be transgressed as long
as life shall last.

   "A priestess shall not keep residence in a district where there are
no priests. This regulation shall be honored, esteemed, revered, and
worshiped, and is not to be transgressed as long as life shall last.

   "On each half-month a priestess shall await from the congregation of
the priests the appointing of fast-day, and some one to come and
administer the admonition. This regulation shall be honored, esteemed,
revered, and worshiped, and is not to be transgressed as long as life
shall last.

   "At the end of residence a priestess shall invite criticism in both
congregations in regard to what has been seen, or heard, or suspected.
This regulation shall be honored, esteemed,

|                                   |                                                 |
|:----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_445">p. 445</span> | <span class="small">\[CV.x.1<sup>4</sup></span> |

revered, and worshiped, and is not to be transgressed as long as life
shall last.

   "If a priestess be guilty of serious sin, she shall undergo penance
of half a month toward both the congregations. This regulation shall be
honored, esteemed, revered, and worshiped, and is not to be transgressed
as long as life shall last.

   "When a female novice has spent her two years in the practice of the
six rules, she shall seek ordination from both the congregations. This
regulation shall be honored, esteemed, revered, and worshiped, and is
not to be transgressed as long as life shall last.

   "A priestess shall not revile or abuse a priest in any manner. This
regulation shall be honored, esteemed, revered, and worshiped, and is
not to be transgressed as long as life shall last.

   "From this day on the priestesses shall not be allowed to reprove the
priests officially, but the priests shall be allowed to reprove the
priestesses officially. This regulation shall be honored, esteemed,
revered, and worshiped, and is not to be transgressed as long as life
shall last.

   "If, Ânanda, Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid will accept these eight
weighty regulations, let it be reckoned to her as her ordination."

   Then the venerable Ânanda, when he had received from The Blessed One
these eight weighty regulations, drew near to Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid;
and having drawn near, he spoke to Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid as follows:

   "If now, O Gotamid, you will accept eight weighty regulations, it
shall be reckoned to you as your ordination:--

   "A priestess of even a hundred years' standing shall salute, rise to
meet, entreat humbly, and perform all respectful offices for a priest,
even if he be but that day ordained. This regulation shall be honored,
esteemed, revered, and worshiped, and is not to be transgressed as long
as life shall last.

   "A priestess shall not keep residence in a district where there are
no priests. This regulation shall be honored, esteemed, revered, and
worshiped, and is not to be transgressed as long as life shall last.

|                                   |                                                 |

   "On each half-month a priestess shall await from the congregation of
the priests the appointing of fast-day, and some one to come and
administer the admonition. This regulation shall be honored, esteemed,
revered, and worshiped, and is not to be transgressed as long as life
shall last.

   "At the end of residence a priestess shall invite criticism in both
congregations in regard to what has been seen, or heard, or suspected.
This regulation shall be honored, esteemed, revered, and worshiped, and
is not to be transgressed as long as life shall last.

   "If a priestess be guilty of serious sin, she shall undergo penance
of half a month toward both the congregations. This regulation shall be
honored, esteemed, revered, and worshiped, and is not to be transgressed
as long as life shall last.

   "When a female novice has spent her two years in the practice of the
six rules, she shall seek ordination from both the congregations. This
regulation shall be honored, esteemed, revered, and worshiped, and is
not to be transgressed as long as life shall last.

   "A priestess shall not revile or abuse a priest in any manner. This
regulation shall be honored, esteemed, revered, and worshiped, and is
not to be transgressed as long as life shall last.

   "From this day on the priestesses shall not be allowed to reprove the
priests officially, but the priests shall be allowed to reprove the
priestesses officially. This regulation shall be honored, esteemed,
revered, and worshiped, and is not to be transgressed as long as life
shall last.

   "If now, O Gotamid, you will accept these eight weighty regulations,
it shall be reckoned to you as your ordination."

   "Just as, O Ânanda, reverend sir, a woman or a man, youthful, young,
and fond of ornament, having bathed his head, and obtained a wreath of
blue lotuses, or a wreath of jasmine flowers, or a wreath of atimuttaka
flowers, would take it up with both hands, and place it on the head, the
noblest part of the body; in exactly the same way do I, O Ânanda,
reverend sir, take up these eight weighty regulations, not to be
transgressed as long as life shall last."

|                                   |                                                 |
|:----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_447">p. 447</span> | <span class="small">\[CV.x.1<sup>6</sup></span> |

   Then the venerable Ânanda drew near to where The Blessed One was; and
having drawn near and greeted The Blessed One, he sat down respectfully
at one side. And seated respectfully at one side, the venerable Ânanda
spoke to The Blessed One as follows:

   "Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid, Reverend Sir, has accepted the eight
weighty regulations; the sister of the mother of The Blessed One has
become ordained."

   "If, Ânanda, women had not retired from household life to the
houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The
Tathâgata, religion, Ânanda, would long endure; a thousand years would
the Good Doctrine abide. But since, Ânanda, women have now retired from
household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline
announced by The Tathâgata, not long, Ânanda, will religion endure; but
five hundred years, Ânanda, will the Good Doctrine abide. Just as,
Ânanda, those families which consist of many women and few men are
easily overcome by burglars, in exactly the same way, Ânanda, when women
retire from household life to the houseless one, under a doctrine and
discipline, that religion does not long endure. Just as, Ânanda, when
the disease called mildew falls upon a flourishing field of rice, that
field of rice does not long endure, in exactly the same way, Ânanda,
when women retire from household life to the houseless one, under a
doctrine and discipline, that religion does not long endure. Even as,
Ânanda, when the disease called rust falls upon a flourishing field of
sugar-cane, that field of sugar-cane does not long endure, in exactly
the same way, Ânanda, when women retire from household life to the
houseless one, under a doctrine and discipline, that religion does not
long endure. And just as, Ânanda, to a large pond a man would prudently
build a dike, in order that the water might not transgress its bounds,
in exactly the same way, Ânanda, have I prudently laid down eight
weighty regulations, not to be transgressed as long as life shall last."
