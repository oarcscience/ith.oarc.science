§ 31. CONTACT.

<span class="small">Translated from the Milindapañha
(60<sup>10</sup>).</span>

   "Bhante Nâgasena, what is contact?"

   "Your majesty, contact is the act of coming in contact."

   "Give an illustration."

   "It is as if, your majesty, two rams were to fight one another. The
eye is comparable to one of these rams, form to the other, and contact
to their collision with each other."

   "Give another illustration."

   "It is as if, your majesty, the two hands were to be clapped
together. The eye is comparable to one hand, form to the other, and
contact to their collision with each other."

   "Give another illustration."

   "It is as if, your majesty, two cymbals were to be clapped together.
The eye is comparable to one cymbal, form to the other, and contact to
their collision with each other."

   "You are an able man, bhante Nâgasena."
