§ 57. THE WAY OF PURITY.

<span class="small">Translated from the Visuddhi-Magga (chap.
i.).</span>

   Therefore has The Blessed One said:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"What man his conduct guardeth, and hath wisdom,<br />
And thoughts and wisdom traineth well,<br />
The strenuous and the able priest,<br />
He disentangles all this snarl."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   When it is said *hath wisdom*, there is meant a wisdom for which he
does not need to strive. For it comes to him through the power of his
deeds in a former existence.

   *The strenuous and the able priest*. Perseveringly by means of the
above-mentioned heroism, and intelligently through the force of his
wisdom, should he *guard* his *conduct*, and *train* himself in the
quiescence and insight indicated by the words *thoughts* and *wisdom*.

   Thus does The Blessed One reveal the Way of Purity under the heads of
conduct, concentration, and wisdom. Thus does he indicate the three
disciplines, a thrice noble religion, the advent of the threefold
knowledge etc., the avoidance of the two extremes and the adoption of
the middle course of conduct, the means of escape from the lower and
other states of existence, the threefold abandonment of the corruptions,
the three hostilities, the purification from the three corruptions, and
the attainment of conversion and of the other degrees of sanctification.

   And how?

   By conduct is indicated the discipline in elevated conduct, by
concentration, the discipline in elevated thoughts; and by wisdom, the
discipline in elevated wisdom.

   By conduct, again, is indicated the nobleness of this religion in its
beginning. The fact that conduct is the beginning of this religion
appears from the passage, "What is the first of the meritorious
qualities? Purity of conduct." And again from that other, which begins
by saying, "It is the nonperformance

|                                   |                                    |
|:----------------------------------|-----------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_286">p. 286</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.i</span> |

of any wickedness." And it is noble because it entails no remorse or
other like evils.

   By concentrntion is indicated its nobleness in the middle. The fact
that concentration is the middle of this religion appears from the
passage which begins by saying, "It is richness in merit." It is noble
because it brings one into the possession of the magical powers and
other blessings.

   By wisdom is indicated its nobleness at the end. The fact that wisdom
is the end of this religion appears from the passage,

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"To cleanse and purify the thoughts,<br />
'T is this the holy Buddhas teach,"<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

and from the fact that there is nothing higher than wisdom. It is noble
because it brings about imperturbability whether in respect of things
pleasant or unpleasant. As it is said:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"Even as the dense and solid rock<br />
Cannot be stirred by wind and storm;<br />
Even so the wise cannot be moved<br />
By voice of blame or voice of praise."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   By conduct, again, is indicated the advent of the threefold
knowledge. For by virtuous conduct one acquires the threefold knowledge,
but gets no further. By concentration is indicated the advent of the Six
High Powers. For by concentration one acquires the Six High Powers, but
gets no further. By wisdom is indicated the advent of the four
analytical sciences. For by wisdom one acquires the four analytical
sciences, and in no other way.

   By conduct, again, is indicated the avoidance of the extreme called
sensual gratification; by concentration, the avoidance of the extreme
called self-torture. By wisdom is indicated the adoption of the middle
course of conduct.

   By conduct, again, is indicated the means of escape from the lower
states of existence; by concentration, the means of escape from the
realm of sensual pleasure; by wisdom, the means of escape from every
form of existence.

   By conduct, again, is indicated the abandonment of the

|                                   |                                    |
|:----------------------------------|-----------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_287">p. 287</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.i</span> |

corruptions through the cultivation of their opposing virtues; by
concentration, the abandonment of the corruptions through their
avoidance; by wisdom, the abandonment of the corruptions through their
extirpation.

   By conduct, again, is indicated the hostility to corrupt acts; by
concentration, the hostility to corrupt feelings; by wisdom, the
hostility to corrupt propensities.

   By conduct, again, is indicated the purification from the corruption
of bad practices; by concentration, the purification from the corruption
of desire; by wisdom, the purification from the corruption of heresy.

   And by conduct, again, is indicated the attainment of conversion, and
of once returning; by concentration, the attainment of never returning;
by wisdom, the attainment of saintship. For the converted are described
as "Perfect in the precepts," as likewise the once returning; but the
never returning as "Perfect in concentration," and the saint as "Perfect
in wisdom."

   Thus are indicated the three disciplines, a thrice noble religion,
the advent of the threefold knowledge etc., the avoidance of the two
extremes and the adoption of the middie course of conduct, the means of
escape from the lower and other states of existence, the threefold
abandonment of the corruptions, the three hostilities, the purification
from the three corruptions, and the attainment of conversion and of the
other degrees of sanctification; and not only these nine triplets, but
also other similar ones.

   Now although this *Way of Purity* was thus taught under the heads of
conduct, concentration, and wisdom, and of the many good qualities
comprised in them, yet this with excessive conciseness; and as,
consequently, many would fail to be benefited, we here give its
exposition in detail.
