§ 18. THE MIND LESS PERMANENT THAN THE BODY.

<span class="small">Translated from the Samyutta-Nikâya
(xii.62<sup>1</sup>).</span>

   Thus have I heard.

   On a certain occasion The Blessed One was dwelling at Sâvatthi in
Jetavana monastery in Anâthapindika's Park. And there The Blessed One
addressed the priests.

   "Priests," said he.

   "Lord," said the priests to The Blessed One in reply. And The Blessed
One spoke as follows:--

   "Even the ignorant, unconverted man, O priests, may conceive an
aversion for this body which is composed of the four elements, may
divest himself of passion for it, and attain to freedom from it. And why
do I say so? Because, O priests, the increase and the wasting away of
this body which

|                                   |                                                  |

| <span id="page_151">p. 151</span> | <span class="small">\[S.12.62<sup>3</sup></span> |

is composed of the four elements are evident, and the way in which it is
obtained and afterwards laid away again.<span
id="page_151_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_151_note_1.md) Therefore here the
ignorant, unconverted man may conceive aversion, divest himself of
passion, and attain to freedom. But that, O priests, which is called
mind, intellect, consciousness,--here the ignorant, unconverted man is
not equal to conceiving aversion, is not equal to divesting himself of
passion, is not equal to attaining freedom. And why do I say so?
Because, O priests, from time immemorial the ignorant, unconverted man
has held, cherished, and affected the notion, 'This is mine; this am I;
this is my Ego.' Therefore here the ignorant, unconverted man is not
equal to conceiving aversion, is not equal to divesting himself of
passion, is not equal to attaining freedom. But it were better, O
priests, if the ignorant, unconverted man regarded the body which is
composed of the four elements as an Ego, rather than the mind. And why
do I say so? Because it is evident, O priests, that this body which is
composed of the four elements lasts one year, lasts two years, lasts
three years, lasts four years, lasts five years, lasts ten years, lasts
twenty years, lasts thirty years, lasts forty years, lasts fifty years,
lasts a hundred years, and even more. But that, O priests, which is
called mind, intellect, consciousness, keeps up an incessant round by
day and by night of perishing as one thing and springing up as another.

   "Here the learned and noble disciple, O priests, attentively
considers Dependent Origination--Behold this exists when that exists,
this originates from the origination of the other; this does not exist
when that does not exist, this ceases from the cessation of the other. O
priests, a pleasant sensation originates in dependence on contact with
pleasant objects; but when that contact with pleasant objects ceases,
the feeling sprung from that contact, the pleasant sensation that
originated in dependence on contact with pleasant objects ceases and
comes to an end. O priests, an unpleasant sensation

|                                   |                                                    |
|:----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_152">p. 152</span> | <span class="small">\[S.xii.62<sup>10</sup></span> |

. . . an indifferent sensation originates in dependence on contact with
indifferent objects; but when that contact with indifferent objects
ceases, the feeling sprung from that contact, the indifferent sensation
that originated in dependence on contact with indifferent objects ceases
and comes to an end.

   "Just as, O priests, heat comes into existence and flame into being
from the friction and concussion of two sticks of wood, but on the
separation and parting of these two sticks of wood the heat sprung from
those two sticks of wood ceases and comes to an end: in exactly the same
way, O priests, a pleasant sensation originates in dependence on contact
with pleasant objects; but when that contact with pleasant objects
ceases, the feeling sprung from that contact, the pleasant sensation
that originated in dependence on contact with pleasant objects ceases
and comes to an end. An unpleasant sensation . . . an indifferent
sensation originates in dependence on contact with indifferent objects;
but when that contact with indifferent objects ceases, the feeling
sprung from that contact, the indifferent sensation that originated in
dependence on contact with indifferent objects ceases and comes to an
end.

   Perceiving this, O priests, the learned and noble disciple conceives
an aversion for contact, conceives an aversion for sensation, conceives
an aversion for perception, conceives an aversion for the
predispositions, conceives an aversion for consciousness. And in
conceiving this aversion he becomes divested of passion, and by the
absence of passion he becomes free, and when he is free he becomes aware
that he is free; and he knows that rebirth is exhausted, that he has
lived the holy life, that he has done what it behooved him to do, and
that he is no more for this world.
