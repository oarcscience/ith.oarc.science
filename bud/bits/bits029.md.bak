§ 29. NAME AND FORM.

<span class="small"><span id="29a">§ 29 *a*.--Translated from the
Visuddhi-Magga (chap. xvii.).</span></span>

   By "Name" are meant the three Groups beginning with Sensation
\[*i.e.*, Sensation, Perception, and the Predispositions\]; by "Form,"
the four elements and form derivative from the four elements.

 

<span class="small"><span id="29b">§ 29 *b*.--Translated from the
Visuddhi-Magga (chap. xviii.).</span></span>

   Name has no power of its own, nor can it go on of its own impulse,
either to eat, or to drink, or to utter sounds, or to make a movement.
Form also is without power and cannot

|                                   |                                        |
|:----------------------------------|---------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_185">p. 185</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xviii</span> |

go on of its own impulse. It has no desire to eat, or to drink, or to
utter sounds, or to make a movement. But Form goes on when supported by
Name, and Name when supported by Form. When Name has a desire to eat, or
to drink, or to utter sounds, or to make a movement, then Form eats,
drinks, utters sounds, makes a movement.

   To make this matter clear they give the following illustration:

   It is as if two men, the one blind from birth and the other a
cripple, were desirous of going traveling. And the man blind from birth
were to say to the cripple as follows: "See here! I am able to use my
legs, but I have no eyes with which to see the rough and the smooth
places in the road." And the cripple were to say to the man blind from
birth as follows: "See here! I am able to use my eyes, but I have no
legs with which to go forward and back." And the man blind from birth,
pleased and delighted, were to mount the cripple on his shoulders. And
the cripple sitting on the shoulders of the man blind from birth were to
direct him, saying, "Leave the left and go to the right; leave the right
and go to the left."

   Here the man blind from birth is without power of his own, and weak,
and cannot go of his own impulse or might. The cripple also is without
power of his own, and weak, and cannot go of his own impulse or might.
Yet when they mutually support one another it is not impossible for them
to go.

   In exactly the same way Name is without power of its own, and cannot
spring up of its own might, nor perform this or that action. Form also
is without power of its own, and cannot spring up of its own might, nor
perform this or that action. Yet when they mutually support one another
it is not impossible for them to spring up and go on."

 

<span class="small"><span id="29c">§ 29 *c*.--Translated from the
Visuddhi-Magga (chap. xx.).</span></span>

   And he knows as follows:

   "No heap or collection of material exists for the production of Name
and Form; nor are Name and Form sprung

|                                   |                                     |
|:----------------------------------|------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_186">p. 186</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xx</span> |

from any such heap or collection of material; and when Name and Form
cease, they do not go to any of the cardinal or intermediate points of
the compass; and after Name and Form have ceased, they do not exist
anywhere in the shape of heaped-up material. But, just as when a lute is
played upon, there is no previous store of sound; and when the sound
comes into existence, it does not come from any such store; and when it
ceases, it does not go to any of the cardinal or intermediate points of
the compass; and when it has ceased, it exists nowhere in a stored-up
state; but having previously been non-existent, it came into existence
in dependence on the body and neck of the lute and the exertions of the
performer; and having come into existence passes away: in exactly the
same way, all the elements of being, both those with form and those
without, come into existence after having previously been non-existent;
and having come into existence pass away.
