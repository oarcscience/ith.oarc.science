§ 103. THE FIVE GROUPS.

   A<span class="small">LTHOUGH</span> it has not been my plan to go
deeply into technical matters, I have been obliged to give such
prominence to the groups that constitute the human being, that it seems
necessary to give a statement of how these groups are made up, in order
that the reader may understand what they are like. Of the translations
which follow, the final one entitled "Karma and the Consciousnesses" is
made from the seventeenth chapter of the Visuddhi-Magga; the other
translations and the materials for the lists are from the fourteenth
chapter of that work.

 

1\. THE FORM-GROUP.

|                       |                                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| A. Elementary forms.  |    10. Femininity.             |
|    1. Earthy element. |    11. Masculinity.            |
|    2. Watery element. |    12. Vitality.               |
|    3. Fiery element.  |    13. Organ of the heart.     |
|    4. Windy element.  |    14. Bodily intimation.      |
| B. Derivative forms.  |    15. Vocal intimation.       |
|    1. Eye.            |    16. Space.                  |
|    2. Ear.            |    17. Buoyancy of form.       |
|    3. Nose.           |    18. Softness of form.       |
|    4. Tongue.         |    19. Suppleness of form.     |
|    5. Body.           |    20. Growth of form.         |
|    6. Form.           |    21. Continuation of form.   |
|    7. Sound.          |    22. Growing old of form.    |
|    8. Odor.           |    23. Transitoriness of form. |
|    9. Taste.          |    24. Material food.          |

 

2\. THE SENSATION-GROUP.

   Sensation conjoined with a meritorious consciousness is a meritorious
sensation; conjoined with a demeritorious consciousness, <span
id="page_488">p. 488</span> it is a demeritorious sensation; conjoined
with an indeterminate consciousness, it is an indeterminate sensation.
It has a fivefold division peculiar to itself; namely, happiness,
misery, gladness, grief, and indifference.

 

3\. THE PERCEPTION-GROUP.

   Perception conjoined with a meritorious consciousness is a
meritorious perception; conjoined with a demeritorious consciousness, it
is a demertorious perception; conjoined with an indeterminate
consciousness, it is an indeterminate perception. For there is no
consciousness that is not conjoined with perception. Accordingly
perception has the same number of divisions as consciousness.

 

4\. THE PREDISPOSITION-GROUP.

|                                 |                                                 |

| 11\. Shame.                     | 36\. Abstinence from wrong occupations.         |
| 12\. Fear of sinning.           |                                                 |

| 14\. Freedom from hatred.       | 38\. Freedom from fear of sinning.              |

*The Functions of the Consciousnesses.*

   The consciousnesses are in all eighty-nine in number and occur on
fourteen different occasions; in conception, existence-substratum,
attention, seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, noticing,
cognizing, defining, the swiftnesses, identical object, and passing
away. And how?

   When, through the power of the eight meritorious consciousnesses
belonging to the realm of sensual pleasure, living beings are born in
the world of gods and men, then, at the moment of conception, occur nine
fruition-consciousnesses; namely, eight fruition-consciousnesses
belonging to the realm of sensual pleasure and possessing a cause,
having as their object any karma, karma-reflex, or destiny-reflex, that
might have been present at the time of death, and also, in the case of
those who in the world of men become eunuchs and the like, a meritorious
fruition-mind-consciousness, coupled with indifference, which, as having
its two causes weak, is called without a cause. When, through the power
of the meritorious consciousuesses belonging to the realms of form and
formlessness, these beings are born in the realms of form and
formlessness, then, at the moment of conception occur nine
fruition-consciousnesses of the realms of form and formlessness, having
as their object any karma-reflex that might have been present at the
time of death. When, however, through the power of the demeritorious
consciousnesses, they are born in hell, then, at the moment of
conception, there occurs only a demeritorious
fruition-mind-consciousness without a cause, having as its object any
karma, karma-reflex, or destiny-reflex, that might have been present at
the time of death. Accordingly, therefore, it is to be understood that
nineteen fruition-consciousnesses occur in *conception*.

   But when conception-consciousness ceases, then, close on its heels,
occurs the precisely similar existence-subtratum-consciousness, being
the fruition of the same karma and having the same object. This repeats
itself, as does the stream of a river, as long as no other thought
arises to interrupt the series, and this process continues indefinitely
during dreamless sleep and like occasions. Accordingly, therefore, it is
to be understood that the same nineteen consciousnesses occur in
*existence-substratum*.

|                                   |                             |
|:----------------------------------|----------------------------:|
| <span id="page_493">p. 493</span> | <span class="small"></span> |

   But when in the course of the existence-substratum series the
sense-apertures of a living being have grown to be competent to grasp
their objects, then, when form comes within the visual field, the
irritability of the eye for form is stimulated, and through the force of
this stimulus existence-substratum is interrupted. When
existence-substratum ceases, action-mind arises to take its place, with
that form as its object, and accomplishing the function of attention.
Similarly in respect of the ear-aperture etc. In the case of the
mind-aperture, however, when the six objects of sense come within range
and existence-substratum has been interrupted, then arises
action-mind-consciousness to take its place, being without a cause and
coupled with indifference and accomplishing the function of attention.
Accordingly it is to be understood that two action-consciousnesses occur
in *attention*.

   But after attention there occurs the eye-consciousness, having for
its instrument the irritability of the eye and accomplishing the
function of sight in the eye-aperture, and there occur the
ear-consciousnees, nose-consciousnees, tongue-consciousnees, and
body-consciousness, accomplishing the functions of hearing etc. in the
ear-aperture etc. These are meritorious fruitions when their objects are
desirable or desirable-neutral, and demeritorious fruitions when their
objects are undesirable or undesirable-neutral. Accordingly it is to be
understood that ten fruition-consciousnesses occur during *seeing*,
*hearing*, *smelling*, *tasting*, and *touching*.

   But when it is said that after eye-consciousness has sprung up and
ceased there arises the thought, mentality, mind due to it, this is
fruition-mind which springs up after the sense-consciousnesses, and
notices their objects. When it succeeds a meritorious
sense-consciousness, it is a meritorious fruition; when it succeeds a
demeritorious sense-consciousness, it is a demeritorious fruition.
Accordingly it is to be understood that two fruition-consciousnesses
occur in *noticing*.

   But when it is said that after mind has sprung up and ceased there
arises the thought, mentality, mind-consciousness due to it, this is
fruition-mind-consciousnees without a cause springing up and cognizing
what has been noticed by the mind. When it succeeds the demeritorious
fruition-mind in an undesirable-neutral object, it is a demeritorious
fruition. When it succeeds the meritorious fruition-mind, it is a
meritorious fruition, being coupled with gladness in the case of a
desirable object, and coupled with indifference in the case of a
desirable-neutral one. Accordingly <span id="page_494">p. 494</span> it
is to be understood that three fruition-consciousnesses occur in the
case of *cognizing*.

   After cognizing there arises action-mind-consciousness without a
cause and coupled with indifference. This defines the object.
Accordingly it is to be understood that one solitary
action-consciousness occurs in *defining*.

   After defining, in case the object, form or the like, is large, then
in respect of the defined object there hasten six or seven swiftnesses.
These are made up either from the eight meritorious consciousnesses
belonging to the realm of sensual pleasure, or from the twelve
demeritorious ones, or from the nine action-consciousnesses belonging to
the realm of sensual pleasure. This is how the case stands in respect to
the five apertures; but in the case of the mind-aperture, only after
attention in the mind-aperture. Beyond *gotrabhû* there occur five
meritorious consciousnesses and five action-consciousnesses belonging to
the realm of form, four meritorious consciousnesses and four
action-consciousnesses belouging to the realm of formlessness, and four
path-thoughts and four fruition-thoughts transcending the world,--all
according as they may have obtained a dependence. Accordingly it is to
be understood that the meritorious consciousnesses, demeritorious
consciousnesses, action-consciousnesses, and fruition-consciousnesses
amount to fifty-five in number in the *swiftnesses*.

   But at the end of the swiftnesses, in case the object in the five
apertures is excessively large, or that in the mind-aperture is vivid,
then any dependence possessed by beings in the realm of sensual pleasure
at the termination of the swiftnesses belonging to that realm, such
dependence, namely, as desirable objects etc., and previous karma,
swiftnesses, thoughts, etc., will have as its result some one of the
eight fruition-consciousnesses belonging to the realm of sensual
pleasure and possessing a cause, or else some one of the three
fruition-minds without a cause. And, as water pursues, though only at an
interval, the stern of a vessel that is proceeding up stream, so this
fruition-consciousness, once or twice repeated, pursues the swiftness
that has spent itself on some object other than an object of
existence-substratum. As this fruition-consciousness, at the same time
with being able at the end of the swiftnesses to exist in an
existence-substratum-object, exists also in an object of a swiftness, it
is called identical object. Accordingly it is to be understood that
eleven fruition-consciousnesses occur in *identical object*.

|                                   |                             |
|:----------------------------------|----------------------------:|
| <span id="page_495">p. 495</span> | <span class="small"></span> |

   But at the end of identical object, existence-substratum occurs
again, and when existence-substratum is interrupted, then attention and
the rest occur again. A series of thoughts which has thus obtained a
dependence always recurs in the regular round of attention following
existence-substratum, and of seeing etc. following attention, until in
any given existence existence-substratum perishes. The passing away in
the last existence of existence-substratum-thought is called passing
away \[death\]. Accordingly the passing-away-consciousness, like
existence-substratum, has nineteen sub-divisions. Accordingly it is to
be understood that nineteen fruition-consciousnesses occur in
*passing-away*.

   But after passing-away comes conception, and after conception
existence-substratum again. Accordingly the series of thoughts of beings
in their rounds of rebirth through modes of existence, destinies,
halting-places, and abodes, is without interruption. But in the case of
one who has attained saintship it ceases as soon as
passing-away-consciousness ceases.

 

*Karma and the Consciousnesses.*

   Karma is so called because it makes whatever is made. Moreover, there
are two kinds of karma; karma depending on ignorance, and other karmas.

   There are six karmas depending on ignorance; namely, the triplet
consisting of meritorious karma, demeritorious karma, and karma leading
to immovability; and the triplet consisting of bodily karma, vocal
karma, aud mental karma. All these are nothing but worldly meritorious
and demeritorious thoughts.<span id="page_495_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_495_note_1.md)

   The other karmas are four in number; namely, static karma,
constituent karma, active karma, and strenuous karma.

   In such phrases as "All the constituents of being are transitory,"
*static karma* is meant; namely, all the elements of being possessing a
dependence.

   In the commentaries, all the elements of being, both those with form
and those without, which have sprung from karma,<span
id="page_495_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_495_note_1.md) and are comprised in the
three modes of being, are called *constituent karmas*.<span
id="page_495_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_495_note_2.md) They are included in the
phrase, "All the constituents of <span id="page_496">p. 496</span> being
are transitory;" but there is no passage quotable for them separately.

   Meritorious and demeritorious thoughts belonging to the three modes
of being are, moreover, *active karma*. For them is quotable the
passage, "This ignorant individual, O priest, performs meritorious karma
etc."<span id="page_496_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_496_note_1.md)

   Bodily and mental heroism is called *strenuous karma*. This is
quotable in the passage, "It went as far as there was room for karma,
and then it stopped, as if struck in the axle."<span
id="page_496_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_496_note_2.md)

   But there are not merely these, there are also others. In such
quotations as, "Brother Visâkha, when any priest enters upon the trance
of the cessation of perception and sensation, first vocal karma ceases,
then bodily karma, and then mental karma," several karmas are mentioned,
but there is no one of these that is not included under *static karma*.
