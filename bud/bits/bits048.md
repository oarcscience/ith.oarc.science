§ 48. REFLECTIONS ON EXISTENCE.

<span class="small">Translation of the nineteenth chapter of the
Visuddhi-Magga.</span>

   The knowledge, however, of the dependence of name and form and the
consequent removal of doubt in the three divisions of time is called the
Purity Ensuing on the Removal of Doubt.

   The priest who is desirous of this knowledge enters on a search for
the causes and dependence of name and form, just as a skilful physician
seeing a disease will search to find how it arose, or just as a
compassionate man seeing a small, weakly, helpless boy-baby lying on its
back in the middle of the road will try to discover its parents.

   And at first he reflects as follows: "Name and form cannot be without
a cause, as they are not the same everywhere, at all times, and for all
people; nor yet are they caused by any personal power or the like, for
there is no such power behind name and form; nor, again, are they right
who say that name and form themselves constitute such a power, as the
name and form thus called a personal power or the like are not a cause.
Therefore it must needs be that name and form have causes and a
dependence. And what are they?

   Having made these reflections, he begins to investigate the causes
and dependence of form, as follows: When this body comes into existence,
it does not arise in the midst of nymphaeas, nelumbiums, lotuses, and
water-lilies, etc., nor of jewels, pearl-necklaces, etc.; but
ill-smelling, disgusting, and repulsive, it arises between the stomach
and the lower intestines, with the belly-wall behind and the back-bone
in front, in the midst of the entrails and mesentery, in an exceedingly
contracted, ill-smelling, disgusting, and repulsive place, like a worm
in rotten fish, carrion, or rancid gruel, or in a stagnant or dirty pool
or the like. As it thus comes into being, these four--ignorance, desire,
attachment, and karma--are the cause of it, inasmuch as they produce it;
food is its dependence, inasmuch as it supports it. These five are its
causes

|                                   |                                      |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_243">p. 243</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xix</span> |

and dependence. Three of these--ignorance etc.--are the basis for this
body, as is the mother for the child; karma is the begetter, as is the
father of the son; food is the sustainer, like the nurse."

   Having thus grasped the dependence of form, he then grasps the
dependence of name, as follows: "In dependence on the eye and in respect
to form, eye-consciousness arises," etc.

   When he has thus perceived the dependent manner of existence of name
and form, he reaches the insight: "As name and form have at the present
time a dependent manner of existence, so also had they in the past time,
and so will they have in the future." In reaching this insight, that
which is called the fivefold questioning concerning the past, namely:

   "Did I exist in past time?

   "Did I not exist in past time?

   "What was I in past time?

   "How was I in past time?

   "Did I in past time change from one existence to another?" and that
called the fivefold questioning concerning the future, namely:

   "Shall I exist in future time?

   "Shall I not exist in future time?

   "What shall I be in future time?

   "How shall I be in future time?

   "Shall I in the future change from one existence to another?" and
that called the sixfold questioning concerning the present, throwing
doubt on his present existence, namely:

   "Am I?

   "Am I not?

   "What am I?

   "How am I?

   "Whence came this existing being?

   "Whither is it to go?"--

   are all abandoned.

   Another observes the twofold dependence of name as

|                                   |                                      |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_244">p. 244</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xix</span> |

general and specific, and the. fourfold one of form as karma etc.

   For the dependence of name is twofold, general and specific. The six
sense-apertures, eye etc., and the six objects of sense, form etc., are
the general dependence of name in respect of giving rise to any kind of
name whether meritorious or not; but attention etc. are special. For
philosophic attention, listening to the Good Doctrine etc. are the
dependence of only meritorious name. Their opposites are the dependence
of that which is demeritorious; karma etc. of fruition;
existence-substratum etc. of action.

   Of form, however, karma etc., *i.e.*, karma, thoughts, the seasons,
and nutriment constitute the fourfold dependence.

   Of these four, it is past *karma* which is the dependence of form
springing from karma; present *thoughts* of that springing from
thoughts; *the seasons and nutriment* are the dependence for the
continuance of that springing from the seasons and from nutriment.

   Thus does one priest grasp the dependence of name and form. And when
he has perceived their dependent manner of existence he reaches the
insight: "As name and form have at the present time a dependent manner
of existence, so also had they in past time, and so will they have in
the future." And when he reaches this insight, the questioning
concerning the three divisions of time is abandoned as aforesaid.

   Another observes in respect of these constituents of being, called
name and form, their growing old and their subsequent dissolution, as
follows: "The old age and death of the constituents of being exist when
birth exists, birth when existence exists, existence when attachment
exists, attachment when desire exists, desire when sensation exists,
sensation when contact exists, contact when the six organs of. sense
exist, the six organs of sense when name and form exist, name and form
when consciousness exists, consciousness when karma exists, karma when
ignorance exists." Thus does he grasp the dependence of name and form by
considering Dependent Origination in the reverse direction. And his
questioning is abandoned as aforesaid.

|                                   |                                      |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_245">p. 245</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xix</span> |

   Another grasps the dependence of name and form by first considering
the formula of Dependent Origination in the forward direction, in full,
"Behold! On ignorance depends karma," etc. And his questioning is
abandoned as aforesaid.

   Another grasps the dependence of name and form by considering the
round of karma and the round of its fruit as follows:

   "Behold! in a former karma-existence, infatuation-ignorance,
initiatory karma, longing desire, approximating attachment, and
thought-existence, these five factors were the dependence for conception
into this existence; rebirth-consciousness, the descent of name and
form, the sensitiveness of the organs of sense, the contact experienced,
the sensation felt, these five factors belonging to the
originating-existence of the present life depend on the karma of a
previous existence; when the senses have matured, then
infatuation-ignorance, . . . thought-existence, these five factors of a
present karma-existence are the dependence of rebirth in the future."

   Now karma is fourfold:

   That which bears fruit in the present existence;

   That which bears fruit in rebirth;

   That which bears fruit at no fixed time; and

   By-gone karma.

   The karma which *bears fruit in the present existence* is the
meritorious or demeritorious thoughts constituting the first swiftness
in the seven thoughts of a stream of swiftnesses. That brings forth
fruit in this existence. But if it fail to do so, then it is *by-gone
karma*, and it is to be said of it in respect to the three divisions of
time, as follows: "That karma has gone by: there was no fruit from it,
nor will there be, nor is there."

   The karma *which bears fruit in rebirth* is the efficacious thought
which constitutes the seventh swiftness. That bears fruit in the next
existence. But if it fail to do so, it is by-gone karma, as described
above.

   The karma *which bears fruit at no fixed time* is the thoughts
constituting the five intermediate swiftnesses. That

|                                   |                                      |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_246">p. 246</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xix</span> |

bears fruit in the future whenever it may find opportunity, and as long
as the round of rebirth continues there is no by-gone karma.

   There is another fourfold division of karma:

   The weighty;

   The abundant;

   The close at hand; and

   The habitual.

   *Weighty* karma--whether meritorious or demeritorious, such as
matricide and other serious crimes of the sort, or lofty deeds--bears
fruit before that which is not weighty.

   That which is *abundant*, whether good conduct or bad conduct, bears
fruit before that which is not abundant.

   That which is *close at hand* is karma remembered at the moment of
death. For the karma which a man remembers at the point of death springs
up with him in rebirth.

   But distinct from all these three is karma that has become *habitual*
through much repetition. This brings on rebirth when the other three are
absent.

   There is another fourfold division of karma:

   Productive;

   Supportive;

   Counteractive; and

   Destructive.

   *Productive* karma may be either meritorious or demeritorious. It
produces both form and the other fruition-groups, Dot only at the time
of conception but as long as they continue.

   *Supportive* karma cannot produce fruit, but when rebirth has been
given by other karma, and fruit has been produced, it supports the
ensuing happiness or misery, and brings about its continuance.

   *Counteractive* karma, when rebirth has been given by other karma,
and fruit has been produced, counteracts the ensuing happiness or
misery, suppresses it, and does not suffer it to continue.

   *Destructive* karma, whether meritorious or demeritorious, destroys
other weak karma, and, preventing it from bearing

|                                   |                                      |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_247">p. 247</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xix</span> |

fruit, makes room for its own fruition. The fruit which thus arises is
called apparitional.

   The distinctions between these twelve different karmas and their
fruits have their inner nature plainly revealed to the insight into
karma and its fruit possessed by the Buddhas, but this insight is not
shared in by their disciples. The man of insight, however, should know
the general distinction between karma and the fruit of karma. Therefore
it is that these distinctions of karma are only explained in rough
outline.

   Thus does this one, in merging these twelve karmas together in the
round of karma, grasp the dependence of name and form by considering the
round of karma and the round of its fruit.

   He who, by thus considering the round of karma and the round of
fruit, grasps the dependent manner of existence of name and form,
reaches the insight: "As name and form have in the present time a
dependent manner of existence by means of a round of karma and a round
of fruit, so also had they in past time, and so will they have in the
future."

   Thus does he have karma and fruit, a round of karma and a round of
fruit, karma's manner of existing and the fruit's manner of existing,
the karma-series and the fruit-series, action and the effect of action.
And he attains to the insight:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"A round of karma and of fruit;<br />
The fruit from karma doth arise,<br />
From karma then rebirth doth spring;<br />
And thus the world rolls on and on."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   When he has attained this insight, the sixteen above-mentioned doubts
concerning the past, present, and future, "Did I exist?" etc., are all
abandoned. And it becomes evident to him that it is merely name and form
which passes through the various modes, classes, stages, grades, and
forms of existence by means of a connection of cause and effect. He sees
that behind the action there is no actor, and that, although actions
bear their fruit, there is no one that experiences that fruit. He then
sees clearly, in the light of the

|                                   |                                      |

| <span id="page_248">p. 248</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xix</span> |

highest knowledge, that when a cause is acting, or the fruit of an
action ripens, it is merely by a conventional form of speech that the
wise speak of an actor or of any one as experiencing the fruit of an
action. Therefore have the ancients said,

   When he has thus grasped the dependence of name and form by
considering the round of karma and the round of fruit, and has abandoned
all questioning in the three divisions of time, he then understands the
past, future, and present elements of being at death and at conception.
This is exact determination. And he knows as follows:

   Those groups which came into existence in the past existence in
dependence on karma, perished then and there. But in dependence on the
karma of that existence other groups have come into being in this
existence. Not a single element of being has come into this existence
from a previous one. The groups which have come into being in this
existence in dependence on karma will perish, and others will come into
being in the next existence, but not a single element of being will go
from this existence into the next. Moreover, just as the words of the
teacher do not pass over into the mouth of the pupil who nevertheless
repeats them; and just as holy water drunk by the messenger sent for the
purpose does not pass into the belly of the sick man and nevertheless in
dependence on this water is the sickness allayed; and just as the
features of the face do not pass to the reflection in mirrors and the
like and nevertheless in dependence on them does the image appear; and
just as the flame does not pass over from the wick of one lamp to that
of another and nevertheless the flame of the second

|                                   |                                      |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_250">p. 250</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xix</span> |

lamp exists in dependence on that of the former: in exactly the same way
not a single element of being passes over from a previous existence into
the present existence, nor hence into the next existence; and yet in
dependence on the groups, organs of sense, objects of sense, and
sense-consciousnesses of the last existence were born those of this one,
and from the present groups, organs of sense, objects of sense, and
sense-consciousnesses will be born the groups, organs of sense, objects
of sense, and sense-consciousnesses of the next existence.

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">

<tr class="even" data-valign="top">

</table>

   When he thus understands the elements at death and at conception, and
this knowledge gained by grasping the dependence of name and form has
become thoroughly established, then the sixteen doubts are still more
completely abandoned. And not merely they, but also the eight doubts
concerning The Teacher etc. are abandoned, and the sixty-two heresies
are estopped.

   The knowledge thus gained by this manifold grasping of the dependence
of name and form, and by the ensuing removal of doubt in the three
divisions of time, is what should be understood by the phrase "the
purity ensuing on the removal of doubt." The knowledge of the
continuance of the factors of being, the knowledge of the truth, and
correct insight, are synonyms of it.

   For it has been said as follows:

|                                   |                                      |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_251">p. 251</span> | <span class="small">\[Vis.xix</span> |

   "The knowledge of the continuance of the factors of being consists of
the wisdom gained by grasping their dependence, as, for example, 'On
ignorance depends karma, in dependence has it originated. Both of these
factors of being have originated by dependence.'"

   In considering the factors of being in the light of their
transitoriness, what is the knowledge of truth thus achieved? wherein
consists correct insight? how does it become plain that all the
constituents of being are transitory? where is doubt abandoned?

   In considering the factors of being in the light of their misery, . .
. in considering the factors of being in the light of their lack of an
Ego, . . . where is doubt abandoned?

   In considering the factors of being in the light of their
transitoriness is achieved the knowledge of the truth of causes; in this
knowledge lies what is called correct insight; as the result of this
knowledge it becomes plain that all the constituents of being are
transitory; here is where doubt is abandoned.

   In considering the factors of being in the light of their misery is
achieved the knowledge of the truth of what exists; in this knowledge
lies what is called correct insight; as the result of this knowledge it
becomes plain that all the constituents of being are misery; here is
where doubt is abandoned.

   In considering the factors of being in the light of their lack of an
Ego is achieved the knowledge of the truth both of the causes of
existence and of existence; in this knowledge lies what is called
correct insight; as the result of this knowledge it becomes plain that
all the constituents of being are wanting in an Ego; here is where doubt
is abandoned.

   Now do the various expressions, "knowledge of the truth," "correct
insight," and "removal of doubt," designate various truths, or are they
various expressions for one truth? Knowledge of the truth, correct
insight, and removal of doubt are various expressions for one truth.

   Now the man of insight, having by this knowledge obtained confidence
in the dispensation of The Buddha, and a footing in it, and having his
destiny established, is called newly converted.
