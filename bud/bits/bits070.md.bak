§ 70. WISDOM.

<span class="small"><span id="70a">§ 70 *a*.--Translated from the
Visuddhi-Magga (chap. xiv.).</span></span>

   What is Wisdom? Wisdom is manifold and various, and an answer that
attempted to be exhaustive would both fail of its purpose and tend to
still greater confusion. Therefore we will confine ourselves to the
meaning here intended,-- Wisdom is knowledge consisting in insight and
conjoined with meritorious thoughts.

 

<span class="small"><span id="70b">§ 70 *b*.--Translated from the
Anguttara-Nikâya (iii.88).</span></span>

   And what, O priests, is the discipline in elevated wisdom?

   Whenever, O priests, a priest knows the truth concerning misery,
knows the truth concerning the origin of misery, knows the truth
concerning the cessation of misery, knows the truth concerning the path
leading to the cessation of misery, this, O priests, is called the
discipline in elevated wisdom.

 

<span class="small"><span id="70c">§ 70 *c*.--Translated from the
Anguttara-Nikâya (ii.3<sup>10</sup>).</span></span>

   What advantage, O priests, is gained by training in insight? Wisdom
is developed. And what advantage is gained by the development of wisdom?
Ignorance is abandoned.
