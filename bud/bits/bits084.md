§ 84. THE ORDER RECEIVE LEAVE TO DWELL IN HOUSES.

<span class="small">Translated from the Culla-Vagga
(vi.1<sup>1</sup>).</span>

   At that time The Buddha, The Blessed One, was dwelling at Râjagaha in
Bamboo Grove, which is in Kalandakanivâpa. Now at that time The Blessed
One had not given permission to the priests to use dwelling-houses. And
the priests of his following dwelt wherever they could,--in the forests,
at the foot of trees, on the hills, in the valleys, in mountain caves,
in cemeteries, in groves of trees, in open spaces, or in heaps of straw.
And they would return early in the morning from their various
resting-places,--from the forests, from the foot of trees, from the
hills, from the valleys, from the mountain caves, from the cemeteries,
from the groves of trees, from the open spaces, or from the heaps of
straw, winning the minds of men with their advancing and their retiring,
with their looking and their gazing, with their drawing in their arms
and their stretching out their arms, and having their eyes cast down,
and perfect in their deportment.

   Now at that time a Râjagaha treasurer went early in the morning to
the park. And the Râjagaha treasurer saw those priests as they returned
early in the morning from their various resting-places,--from the
forests, from the foot of trees, from the hills, from the valleys, from
the mountain caves, from the cemeteries, from the groves of trees, from
the open spaces, or from the heaps of straw, winning the minds of men
with their advancing and their retiring, with their looking and their
gazing, with their drawing in their arms and their stretching out their
arms, and having their eyes cast down, and perfect in their
deportment,--and when he had seen them, his mind was won. Then the
Râjagaha treasurer drew near to where those priests were, and having
drawn near, he spoke to those priests as follows:

   "Reverend sirs, if I were to build some monastery cells, would ye
dwell in those my monastery cells?"

|                                   |                                                  |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_412">p. 412</span> | <span class="small">\[CV.vi.1<sup>2</sup></span> |

   "O householder, The Blessed One has not given permission to use
monastery cells."

   "In that case, reverend sirs, ask The Blessed One about the matter,
and announce to me his answer."

   "Very well, O householder," said those priests to the Râjagaha
treasurer in assent, and drew near to where The Blessed One was; and
having drawn near and greeted The Blessed One, they sat down
respectfully at one side. And seated respectfully at one side, they
spoke to The Blessed One as follows:

   "Reverend Sir, a Râjagaha treasurer is desirous of building some
monastery cells. Reverend Sir, how shall we act in the matter?"

   Then The Blessed One, on that occasion, after he had delivered a
doctrinal discourse, addressed the priests:

   "O priests, I permit places of retreat of five different kinds;
monastery cells, Bengal houses, storied mansions, mansions with attics,
and huts."

   Then those priests drew near to where the Râjagaha treasurer was; and
having drawn near, they spoke to the Râjagaha treasurer as follows:

   "O householder, The Blessed One has given permission to use monastery
cells. Pray, suit your own convenience."

   Then the Râjagaha treasurer in one day established sixty monastery
cells. And the Râjagaha treasurer, having completed those sixty
monastery cells, drew near to where The Blessed One was; and having
drawn near and greeted The Blessed One, he sat down respectfully at one
side. And seated respectfully at one side, the Râjagaha treasurer spoke
to The Blessed One as follows:

   "Reverend Sir, let The Blessed One consent to take breakfast at my
house to-morrow, together with the congregation of the priests."

   And The Blessed One consented by his silence.

   Then the Râjagaha treasurer, perceiving that The Blessed One had
given his consent, rose from his seat, and saluted The Blessed One; and
keeping his right side toward him, he departed.

|                                   |                                                  |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_413">p. 413</span> | <span class="small">\[CV.vi.1<sup>4</sup></span> |

   Then the Râjagaha treasurer, when night was over, prepared excellent
food, both hard and soft, and sent word to The Blessed One:

   "Reverend Sir, breakfast is ready."

   Then The Blessed One, having put on his tunic in the morning, took
his bowl and his robes, and drew near to where the house of the Râjagaha
treasurer was; and having drawn near, together with the congregation of
the priests, he sat down in the seat that was spread for him. Then the
Râjagaha treasurer served The Buddha and the congregation of the priests
that followed him with excellent food, both hard and soft, with his own
hands, until they were satisfied, and would take no more. And when The
Blessed One had finished eating, and had washed his bowl and his hands,
the Râjagaha treasurer sat down respectfully at one side. And seated
respectfully at one side, he spoke to The Blessed One as follows:

   "Reverend Sir, I have built these sixty monastery cells in the hope
of merit, and in the hope of heaven. Reverend Sir, how shall I act in
the matter of these monastery cells?"

   "In that case, O householder, dedicate these sixty monastery cells to
the Order, both present, and to come, and throughout the world."

   "Very well, Reverend Sir," said the Râjagaha treasurer to The Blessed
One in assent, and dedicated those sixty monastery cells to the Order,
both present, and to come, and throughout the world.

   Then The Blessed One gave thanks to the Râjagaha treasurer in the
following stanzas:--

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"The cold, the heat, it beateth back,<br />
And ravenous beasts of every sort,<br />
The snakes that creep, the gnats that bite,<br />
The winter's cold, the heavy rains;<br />
And when the dreaded, torrid winds<br />
Spring up, they, too, are beaten back.<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even" data-valign="top">
<td>"A place for refuge, and for ease,<br />
To meditate, and insight gain,<br />
Are monasteries, best of gifts,<br />
And of The Buddha highly praised.<br />
</td>

</tbody>
</table>

|                                   |                                                  |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"Therefore, if any man is wise,<br />
And cherisheth his weal at heart,<br />
Then monasteries let him build,<br />
And lodge therein the erudite.<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even" data-valign="top">
<td>"Let food to eat, and also drink,<br />
And clothes, and bedding in full store,<br />

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">

And all his miseries put to flight;<br />
And he, when once he sees the truth,<br />
Depraved no more, Nirvana gains."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   Then The Blessed One, having given thanks to the Râjagaha treasurer
in the foregoing stanzas, rose from his seat and departed.
