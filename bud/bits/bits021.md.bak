§ 21. THE COMPOSITION OF THE BODY.

<span class="small">Translated from the Visuddhi-Magga (chap.
xi.).</span>

   The amount of the earthy element in the body of a man of medium size
is about a bushel, and consists of an exceedingly fine and impalpable
powder. This is prevented from being

dispersed and scattered abroad, because it is held together by about
half a bushel of the watery element and is preserved by the fiery
element and is propped up by the windy element. And thus prevented from
being dispersed and scattered abroad, it masquerades in many different
disguises, such as the various members and organs of women and men, and
gives the body its thinness, thickness, length, shortness, firmness,
solidity, etc.

   The watery element is of a juicy nature and serves to hold the body
together. It is prevented from trickling or flowing away, because it
rests in the earthy element and is preserved by the fiery element and is
propped up by the windy element. And thus prevented from trickling or
flowing away, it gives the body its plumpness or leanness.

   The fiery element has heat as its characteristic, and has a vaporous
nature, and digests what is eaten and drunk. Resting in the earthy
element and held together by the watery element and propped up by the
windy element, it cooks the body and gives it its beauty of complexion.
And the body thus cooked is kept free from decay.

   The windy element is characterized by its activeness and its ability
to prop up, and courses through every member of the body. Resting in the
earthy element and held together by the watery element and preserved by
the fiery element, it props up the body. And it is because the body is
thus propped up that it does not fall over, but stands upright. And it
is when the body is impelled by the windy element that it performs its
four functions of walking, standing, sitting, or lying-down, or draws in
and stretches out its arms, or moves its hands and its feet.

   Thus does this machine made of the four elements move like a puppet,
and deceives all foolish people with its femininity, masculinity, etc.
