Heritage

### FOREWORD

Long ago I was captivated by the charm of the Jataka Tales and realized
the excellent use that might be made of them in the teaching of
children. The obvious lessons are many of them suitable for little
people, and beneath the obvious there are depths and depths of meaning
which they may learn to fathom later on. The Oriental setting lends an
additional fascination. I am glad that Miss Babbitt has undertaken to
put together this collection, and commend it freely to teachers and
parents.

FELIX ADLER.
