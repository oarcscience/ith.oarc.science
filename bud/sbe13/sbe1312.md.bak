# THE MAHÂVAGGA.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

REVERENCE TO THE BLESSED ONE, THE HOLY ONE, THE FULLY ENLIGHTENED ONE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FIRST KHANDHAKA.

(THE ADMISSION TO THE ORDER OF BHIKKHUS.)

### <span id="1"></span>1<span id="page_73_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_73_note_1.md).

   <span id="1:1"></span>1. At that time the blessed Buddha dwelt at
<span id="page_74">p. 74</span> Uruvelâ, on the bank of the river
Nera*ñg*arâ<span id="page_74_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_74_note_1.md) at the foot of the Bodhi
tree (tree of wisdom), just after he had become Sambuddha. And the
blessed Buddha sat cross-legged at the foot of the Bodhi tree
uninterruptedly during seven days, enjoying the bliss of
emancipation<span id="page_74_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_74_note_2.md).

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

   <span id="1:2"></span>2. Then the Blessed One (at the end of these
seven days) during the first watch of the night fixed his mind upon the
Chain of Causation<span id="page_75_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_75_note_1.md), in direct and in reverse
order: 'From Ignorance<span id="page_75_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_75_note_2.md) spring the <span
id="page_76">p. 76</span> sa*m*khâras<span
id="page_76_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_76_note_1.md), from the sa*m*khâras
springs Consciousness, from Consciousness spring Name-and-Form, from
Name-and-Form spring the six Provinces (of the <span id="page_77">p.
77</span> six senses<span id="page_77_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_77_note_1).md), from the six Provinces
springs Contact, from Contact springs Sensation, from Sensation springs
Thirst (or Desire), from Thirst springs Attachment, from Attachment
springs Existence, from Existence springs Birth, from Birth spring Old
Age and Death, grief, lamentation, suffering, dejection, and despair.
Such is the origination of this whole mass of suffering. Again, by the
destruction of Ignorance, which consists in the complete absence of
lust, the sa*m*khâras are destroyed, by the destruction of the
sa*m*khâras Consciousness is destroyed, by the destruction of
Consciousness Name-and-Form are destroyed, by the destruction of
Name-and-Form the six Provinces are destroyed, by the destruction of the
six Provinces Contact is destroyed, by the destruction of Contact
Sensation is destroyed, by the destruction of Sensation Thirst is
destroyed, by the destruction of Thirst Attachment is destroyed, by the
destruction of Attachment Existence is destroyed, by the destruction of
Existence Birth is destroyed, by the destruction of Birth Old Age and
Death, grief, lamentation, suffering, dejection, and despair are <span
id="page_78">p. 78</span> destroyed. Such is the cessation of this whole
mass of suffering.'

   <span id="1:3"></span>3. Knowing this the Blessed One then on that
occasion pronounced this solemn utterance: 'When the real nature of
things becomes clear to the ardent, meditating Brâhma*n*a, then all his
doubts fade away, since he realises what is that nature and what its
cause.'

   <span id="1:4"></span>4. Then the Blessed One during the middle watch
of the night fixed his mind upon the Chain of Causation, in direct and
reverse order: 'From Ignorance spring the sa*m*khâras, &c. Such is the
origination of this whole mass of suffering, &c. Such is the cessation
of this whole mass of suffering.'

   <span id="1:5"></span>5. Knowing this the Blessed One then on that
occasion pronounced this solemn utterance: 'When the real nature of
things becomes clear to the ardent, meditating Brâhma*n*a, then all his
doubts fade away, since he has understood the cessation of causation.'

   <span id="1:6"></span>6. Then the Blessed One during the third watch
of the night fixed his mind, &c.

   <span id="1:7"></span>7. Knowing this the Blessed One then on that
occasion pronounced this solemn utterance: 'When the real nature of
things becomes clear to the ardent, meditating Brâhma*n*a, he stands,
dispelling the hosts of Mâra, like the sun that illuminates the sky.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here ends the account of what passed under the Bodhi tree.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

### <span id="2"></span>2.

   <span id="2:1"></span>1. Then the Blessed One, at the end of those
seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot
of the Bodhi tree to the A*g*apâla banyan tree (banyan tree of the
goat-herds<span id="page_79_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_79_note_1).md). And when he had reached
it, he sat cross-legged at the foot of the A*g*apâla banyan tree
uninterruptedly during seven days, enjoying the bliss of emancipation.

   <span id="2:2"></span>2. Now a certain Brâhma*n*a, who was of a
haughty disposition<span id="page_79_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_79_note_2.md), went to the place where
the Blessed One was; having approached him, he exchanged greeting with
the Blessed One; having exchanged with him greeting and complaisant
words, he stationed himself near him; then standing near him that
Brâhma*n*a thus spoke to the Blessed One: 'By what, Gotama; does one
become a Brâhma*n*a, and what are the characteristics that make a man a
Brâhma*n*a?'

   <span id="2:3"></span>3. And the Blessed One, having heard that, on
this occasion pronounced this solemn utterance: 'That Brâhma*n*a who has
removed (from himself) all sinfulness, who is free from haughtiness,
free from impurity, self-restrained, who is an accomplished master of
knowledge (or, of the Veda), who has fulfilled the duties of holiness,
such a Brâhma*n*a may <span id="page_80">p. 80</span> justly call
himself a Brâhma*n*a, whose behaviour is uneven to nothing in the
world.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here ends the account of what passed under the A*g*apâla tree.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="3"></span>3.

   <span id="3:1"></span>1. Then the Blessed One, at the end of those
seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot
of the A*g*apâla banyan tree to the Mu*k*alinda tree. And when he had
reached it, he sat cross-legged at the foot of the Mu*k*alinda tree
uninterruptedly during seven days, enjoying the bliss of emancipation.

   <span id="3:2"></span>2. At that time a great cloud appeared out of
season, rainy weather which lasted seven days, cold weather, storms, and
darkness. And the Nâga (or Serpent) king Mu*k*alinda came out from his
abode, and seven times encircled the body of the Blessed One with his
windings, and kept extending his large hood over the Blessed One's head,
thinking to himself: 'May no coldness (touch) the Blessed One! May no
heat (touch) the Blessed One! May no vexation by gadflies and gnats, by
storms and sunheat and reptiles (touch) the Blessed One!'

   <span id="3:3"></span>3. And at the end of those seven days, when the
Nâga king Mu*k*alinda saw the open, cloudless sky, he loosened his
windings from the body of the Blessed One, made his own appearance
disappear, created the appearance of a youth, and stationed himself in
front of the Blessed One, raising his clasped hands, and paying
reverence to the Blessed One.

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

   <span id="3:4"></span>4. And the Blessed One, perceiving that, on
this occasion, pronounced this solemn utterance: 'Happy is the solitude
of him who is full of joy, who has learnt the Truth, who sees (the
Truth). Happy is freedom from malice in this world, (self-)restraint
towards all beings that have life. Happy is freedom from lust in this
world, getting beyond all desires; the putting away of that pride which
comes from the thought "I am!" This truly is the highest happiness!'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here ends the account of what passed under the Mu*k*alinda tree.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="4"></span>4.

   <span id="4:1"></span>1. Then the Blessed One, at the end of those
seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot
of the Mu*k*alinda tree to the Râ*g*âyatana (tree<span
id="page_81_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_81_note_1).md); when he had reached it,
he sat cross-legged at the foot of the Râ*g*âyatana tree uninterruptedly
during seven days, enjoying the bliss of emancipation.

   <span id="4:2"></span>2. At that time Tapussa and Bhallika, two
merchants, came travelling on the road from Ukkala (Orissa) to that
place. Then a deity who had been (in a former life) a blood-relatian of
the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika, thus spoke to the merchants <span
id="page_82">p. 82</span> Tapussa and Bhallika: 'Here, my noble friends,
at the foot of the Râ*g*âyatana tree, is staying the Blessed One, who
has just become Sambuddha. Go and show your reverence to him, the
Blessed One, by (offering him) rice-cakes and lumps of honey. Long will
this be to you for a good and for a blessing.'

   <span id="4:3"></span>3. And the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika took
rice-cakes and lumps of honey, and went to the place where the Blessed
One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One,
they stationed themselves near him; standing near him, the merchants
Tapussa and Bhallika thus addressed the Blessed One: 'May, O Lord, the
Blessed One accept from us these rice-cakes and lumps of honey, that
that may long be to us for a good and for a blessing!

   <span id="4:4"></span>4. Then the Blessed One thought: 'The
Tathâgatas<span id="page_82_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_82_note_1) do not accept (food.md) with
their hands. Now <span id="page_83">p. 83</span> with what shall I
accept the rice-cakes and lumps of honey?' Then the four Mahârâ*g*a
gods<span id="page_83_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_83_note_1.md), understanding by the
power of their minds the reflection which had arisen in the mind of the
Blessed One, offered to the Blessed One from the four quarters (of the
horizon) four bowls made of stone (saying), 'May, O Lord, the Blessed
One accept herewith the rice-cakes and the lumps of honey!' The Blessed
One accepted those new stone bowls; and therein be received the
rice-cakes and honey lumps, and those, when he had received, he ate.

   <span id="4:5"></span>5. And Tapussa and Bhallika, the merchants,
when they saw that the Blessed One had cleansed<span
id="page_83_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_83_note_2.md) his bowl and his hands,
bowed down in reverence <span id="page_84">p. 84</span> at the feet of
the Blessed One and thus addressed the Blessed One: 'We take our refuge,
Lord, in the Blessed One and in the Dhamma; may the Blessed One receive
us as disciples who, from this day forth while our life lasts, have
taken their refuge (in him).' These were the first in the world to
become lay-disciples (of the Buddha) by the formula which contained
(only) the dyad<span id="page_84_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_84_note_1.md).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here ends the account of what passed under the Râ*g*âyatana tree.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="5"></span>5.

   <span id="5:1"></span>1. Then the Blessed One, at the end of those
seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot
of the Râ*g*âyatana tree to the A*g*apâla banyan tree. And when he had
reached it, the Blessed One stayed there at the foot of the A*g*apâla
banyan tree.

   <span id="5:2"></span>2. Then in the mind of the Blessed One, who was
alone, and had retired into solitude, the following thought arose: 'I
have penetrated this doctrine which is profound, difficult to perceive
and to understand, which brings quietude of heart, which is exalted,
which is unattainable by reasoning, abstruse, intelligible (only) to the
wise. This people, on the other hand, is given to desire, intent upon
desire, delighting in desire. To this people, therefore, who <span
id="page_85">p. 85</span> are given to desire, intent upon desire,
delighting in desire, the law of causality and the chain of causation
will be a matter difficult to understand; most difficult for them to
understand will be also the extinction of all sa*m*khâras, the getting
rid of all the substrata (of existence<span
id="page_85_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_85_note_1).md), the destruction of
desire, the absence of passion, quietude of heart, Nirvâ*n*a! Now if I
proclaim the doctrine, and other men are not able to understand my
preaching, there would result but weariness and annoyance to me.'

   <span id="5:3"></span>3. And then the following . . . .<span
id="page_85_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_85_note_2.md) stanzas, unheard before,
occurred to the Blessed One: 'With great pains have I acquired it.
Enough! why should I now proclaim it? This doctrine will not be easy to
understand to beings that are lost in lust and hatred.

   'Given to lust, surrounded with thick darkness, they will not see
what is repugnant (to their minds), abstruse, profound, difficult to
perceive, and subtle.'

   <span id="5:4"></span>4. When the Blessed One pondered over this
matter, his mind became inclined to remain in quiet, and not to preach
the doctrine. Then Brahmâ <span id="page_86">p. 86</span> Sahampati<span
id="page_86_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_86_note_1.md), understanding by the
power of his mind the reflection which had arisen in the mind of the
Blessed One, thought: 'Alas! the world perishes! Alas! the world is
destroyed! if the mind of the Tathâgata, of the holy, of the absolute
Sambuddha inclines itself to remain in quiet, and not to preach the
doctrine.'

   <span id="5:5"></span>5. Then Brahmâ Sahampati disappeared from
Brahma's world, and appeared before the Blessed One (as quickly) as a
strong man might stretch his bent arm out, or draw back his
out-stretched arm.

   <span id="5:6"></span>6. And Brahmâ Sahampati adjusted his upper robe
so as to cover one shoulder, and putting his right knee on the ground,
raised his joined hands towards the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed
One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One preach the doctrine! may the perfect One
preach the doctrine! there are beings whose mental eyes are darkened by
scarcely any dust; but if they do not hear the doctrine, they cannot
attain salvation. These will understand the doctrine.'

   <span id="5:7"></span>7. Thus spoke Brahmâ Sahampati; and when he had
thus spoken, he further said: 'The Dhamma hitherto manifested in the
country of Magadha has been impure, thought out by contaminated men. But
do thou now open the door of the Immortal<span
id="page_86_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_86_note_2.md); let them hear the
doctrine discovered by the spotless One!

   'As a man standing on a rock, on mountain's <span id="page_87">p.
87</span> top, might overlook the people all around, thus, O wise One,
ascending to the highest palace of Truth, look down, all-seeing One,
upon the people lost in suffering, overcome by birth and decay,--thou,
who hast freed thyself from suffering!

   'Arise, O hero; O victorious One! Wander through the world, O leader
of the pilgrim band, who thyself art free from debt. May the Blessed One
preach the doctrine; there will be people who can understand it!'

   <span id="5:8"></span>8. When he had spoken thus, the Blessed One
said to Brahmâ Sahampati: 'The following thought, Brahmâ, has occurred
to me: "I have penetrated this doctrine, . . . . (&c., down to end of §
2)." And also, Brahmâ, the following . . . .<span
id="page_87_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_87_note_1.md) stanzas have presented
themselves to my mind, which had not been heard (by me) before: "With
great pains, . . . . (&c., down to end of § 3)." When I pondered over
this matter, Brahmâ, my mind became inclined to remain in quiet, and not
to preach the doctrine.'

   <span id="5:9"></span>9. And a second time Brahmâ Sahampati said to
the Blessed One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One preach the doctrine, . . . .
(&c., as in §§ 6, 7).' And for the second time the Blessed One said to
Brahmâ Sahampati: 'The following thought . . . . (&c., as before).'

   <span id="5:10"></span>10. And a third time Brahmâ Sahampati said to
the Blessed One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One preach the doctrine, . . . .
(&c., as before).'

   Then the Blessed One, when he had heard Brahmâ's solicitation,
looked, full of compassion towards sentient beings, over the world, with
his (all-perceiving) eye of a Buddha. And the Blessed One, looking over
the world with his eye of a Buddha, <span id="page_88">p. 88</span> saw
beings whose mental eyes were darkened by scarcely any dust, and beings
whose eyes were covered by much dust, beings sharp of sense and blunt of
sense, of good disposition and of bad disposition, easy to instruct and
difficult to instruct, some of them seeing the dangers of future life
and of sin.

   <span id="5:11"></span>11. As, in a pond of blue lotuses, or
water-roses, or white lotuses, some blue lotuses, or water-roses, or
white lotuses, born in the water, grown up in the water, do not emerge
over the water, but thrive hidden under the water; and other blue
lotuses, or water-roses, or white lotuses, born in the water, grown up
in the water, reach to the surface of the water; and other blue lotuses,
or water-roses, or white lotuses, born in the water, grown up in the
water, stand emerging out of the water, and the water does not touch
them,--

   <span id="5:12"></span>12. Thus the Blessed One, looking over the
world with his eye of a Buddha, saw beings whose mental eyes were
darkened, . . . . (&c., the text repeats § 10); and when he had thus
seen them, he addressed Brahmâ Sahampati in the following stanza: 'Wide
opened is the door of the Immortal to all who have ears to hear; let
them send forth faith to meet it. The Dhamma sweet and good I spake not,
Brahmâ, despairing of the weary task, to men.'

   <span id="5:13"></span>13. Then Brahmâ Sahampati understood: 'The
Blessed One grants my request that He should preach the doctrine.' And
he bowed down before the Blessed One, and passed round him with his
right side towards him; and then he straightway disappeared.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here ends the story of Brahmâ's request.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

### <span id="6"></span>6.

   <span id="6:1"></span>1. Now the Blessed One thought: 'To whom shall
I preach the doctrine first? Who will understand this doctrine easily?'
And the Blessed One thought: 'There is Â*l*âra Kâlâma<span
id="page_89_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_89_note_1.md); he is clever, wise, and
learned; long since have the eye of his mind been darkened by scarcely
any dust. What if I were to preach the doctrine first to Â*l*âra Kâlâma?
He will easily understand this doctrine.'

   <span id="6:2"></span>2. Then an invisible deity said to the Blessed
One: 'Â*l*âra Kâlâma has died, Lord, seven days ago.' And knowledge
sprang up in the Blessed One's mind that Â*l*âra Kâlâma had died seven
days ago. And the Blessed One thought: 'Highly noble was Alâra Kâlâma.
If he had heard my doctrine, he would easily have understood it.'

   <span id="6:3"></span>3. Then the Blessed One thought: 'To whom shall
I preach the doctrine first? Who will understand this doctrine easily?'
And the Blessed One thought: 'There is Uddaka Râmaputta<span
id="page_89_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_89_note_1.md); he is clever, wise, and
learned; long since have the eye or his mind been darkened by scarcely
any dust. What if I were to preach the doctrine first to Uddaka
Râmaputta? He will easily understand this doctrine.'

   <span id="6:4"></span>4. Then an invisible deity said to the Blessed
One: 'Uddaka Râmaputta has died, Lord, yesterday evening.' And knowledge
arose in the Blessed One's mind that Uddaka Râmaputta had died the
previous evening. And the Blessed One thought: <span id="page_90">p.
90</span> 'Highly noble was Uddaka Râmaputta. If he had heard my
doctrine, he would easily have understood it.'

   <span id="6:5"></span>5. Then the Blessed One thought: 'To whom shall
I preach the doctrine first? Who will understand this doctrine easily?'
And the Blessed One thought: 'The five Bhikkhus<span
id="page_90_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_90_note_1.md) have done many services
to me<span id="page_90_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_90_note_2.md); they attended on me
during the time of my exertions (to attain sanctification by undergoing
austerities). What if I were to preach the doctrine first to the five
Bhikkhus?'

   <span id="6:6"></span>6. Now the Blessed One thought: 'Where do the
five Bhikkhus dwell now?' And the Blessed One saw by the power of his
divine, clear vision, surpassing that of men, that the five Bhikkhus
were living at Benares, in the deer park Isipatana<span
id="page_90_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_90_note_3.md). And the Blessed One,
after having remained at Uruvelâ as long as he thought fit, went forth
to Benares.

   <span id="6:7"></span>7. Now Upaka, a man belonging to the Â*g*îvaka
sect (i.e. the sect of naked ascetics), saw the Blessed One travelling
on the road, between Gayâ and the Bodhi tree; and when he saw him, he
said to the Blessed One: 'Your countenance, friend, is serene; your
complexion is pure and bright. In whose <span id="page_91">p. 91</span>
name, friend, have you retired from the world? Who is your teacher?
Whose doctrine do you profess?'

   <span id="6:8"></span>8. When Upaka the Â*g*îvaka had spoken thus,
the Blessed One addressed him in the following stanzas: 'I have overcome
all foes; I am all-wise; I am free from stains in every way; I have left
everything; and have obtained emancipation by the destruction of desire.
Having myself gained knowledge, whom should I call my master? I have no
teacher; no one is equal to me; in the world of men and of gods no being
is like me. I am the holy One in this world, I am the highest teacher, I
alone am the absolute Sambuddha; I have gained coolness (by the
extinction of all passion) and have obtained Nirvâ*n*a. To found the
Kingdom of Truth I go to the city of the Kâsis (Benares); I will beat
the drum of the Immortal in the darkness of this world.'

   <span id="6:9"></span>9. (Upaka replied): 'You profess then, friend,
to be the holy, absolute *G*ina<span
id="page_91_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_91_note_1.md).'

   (Buddha said): 'Like me are all *G*inas who have reached extinction
of the Âsavas<span id="page_91_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_91_note_2.md); I have overcome (*g*itâ
me) all states of sinfulness; therefore, Upaka, am I the *G*ina.'

   When he had spoken thus, Upaka the Â*g*îvaka replied: 'It may be so,
friend;' shook his head, took another road, and went away.

   <span id="6:10"></span>10. And the Blessed One, wandering from place
to place, came to Benares, to the deer park Isipatana, to the place
where the five Bhikkhus were. And <span id="page_92">p. 92</span> the
five Bhikkhus saw the Blessed One coming from afar; when they saw him,
they concerted with each other, saying, 'Friends, there comes the
sama*n*a Gotama, who lives in abundance, who has given up his exertions,
and who has turned to an abundant life. Let us not salute him; nor rise
from our seats when he approaches; nor take his bowl and his robe from
his hands. But let us put there a seat; if he likes, let him sit down.'

   <span id="6:11"></span>11. But when the Blessed One gradually
approached near unto those five Bhikkhus, the five Bhikkhus kept not
their agreement. They went forth to meet the Blessed One; one took his
bowl and his robe, another prepared a seat, a third one brought water
for the washing of the feet, a foot-stool, and a towel<span
id="page_92_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_92_note_1.md). Then the Blessed One sat
down on the seat they had prepared; and when he was seated, the Blessed
One washed his feet. Now they addressed the Blessed One by his name, and
with the appellation 'Friend.'

   <span id="6:12"></span>12. When they spoke to him thus, the Blessed
One said to the five Bhikkhus: 'Do not address, O Bhikkhus, the
Tathâgata by his name, and with the appellation "Friend." The Tathâgata,
O Bhikkhus, is the holy, absolute Sambuddha. Give ear, O Bhikkhus! The
immortal (Amata) has been won (by me); I will teach you; to you I preach
the doctrine. If you walk in the way I show you, you will, ere long,
have penetrated to the truth, having yourselves known it and seen it
face to face; and you <span id="page_93">p. 93</span> will live in the
possession of that highest goal of the holy life, for the sake of which
noble youths fully give up the world and go forth into the houseless
state.

   <span id="6:13"></span>13. When he had spoken thus, the five monks
said to the Blessed One: 'By those observances, friend Gotama, by those
practices, by those austerities, you have not been able to obtain power
surpassing that of men, nor the superiority of full and holy knowledge
and insight. How will you now, living in abundance, having given up your
exertions, having turned to an abundant life, be able to obtain power
surpassing that of men, and the superiority of full and holy knowledge
and insight?'

   <span id="6:14"></span>14. When they had spoken thus, the Blessed One
said to the five Bhikkhus: 'The Tathâgata, O Bhikkhus, does not live in
abundance, he has not given up exertion, he has not turned to an
abundant life. The Tathâgata, O Bhikkhus, is the holy, absolute
Sambuddha. Give ear, O Bhikkhus; the immortal has been won (by me); I
will teach you, to you I will preach the doctrine. If you walk in the
way I show you, you will, ere long, have penetrated to the truth, having
yourselves known it and seen it face to face; and you will live in the
possession of that highest goal of the holy life, for the sake of which
noble youths fully give up the world and go forth into the houseless
state.'

   <span id="6:15"></span>15. And the five Bhikkhus said to the Blessed
One a second time (as above). And the Blessed One said to the five
Bhikkhus a second time (as above). And the five Bhikkhus said to the
Blessed One a third time (as above).

   <span id="6:16"></span>16. When they had spoken thus, the Blessed One
<span id="page_94">p. 94</span> said to the five Bhikkhus: 'Do you
admit, O Bhikkhus, that I have never spoken to you in this way before
this day?'

   'You have never spoken so, Lord.'

   'The Tathâgata, O Bhikkhus, is the holy, absolute Sambuddha. Give
ear, O Bhikkhus, &c. (as above).'

   And the Blessed One was able to convince the five Bhikkhus; and the
five Bhikkhus again<span id="page_94_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_94_note_1.md) listened willingly to the
Blessed One; they gave ear, and fixed their mind on the knowledge (which
the Buddha imparted to them).

   <span id="6:17"></span>17. And the Blessed One thus addressed the
five Bhikkhus<span id="page_94_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_94_note_2.md): 'There are two
extrernes, O Bhikkhus, which he who has given up the world, ought to
avoid. What are these two extremes? A life given to pleasures, devoted
to pleasures and lusts: this is degrading, sensual, vulgar, ignoble, and
profitless; and a life given to mortifications: this is painful,
ignoble, and profitless. By avoiding these two extrernes, O Bhikkhus,
the Tathâgata has gained the knowledge of the Middle Path which leads to
insight, which leads to wisdom, which conduces to calm, to knowledge, to
the Sambodhi, to Nirvâ*n*a.

   <span id="6:18"></span>18. 'Which, O Bhikkhus, is this Middle Path
the knowledge of which the Tathâgata has gained, which leads to insight,
which leads to wisdom, which conduces <span id="page_95">p. 95</span> to
calm, to knowledge, to the Sambodhi, to Nirvâ*n*a? It is the holy
eightfold Path, namely, Right Belief, Right Aspiration, Right Speech,
Right Conduct, Right Means of Livelihood, Right Endeavour, Right
Mernory, Right Meditation. This, O Bhikkhus, is the Middle Path the
knowledge of which the Tathâgata has gained, which leads to insight,
which leads to wisdom, which conduces to calm, to knowledge, to the
Sambodhi, to Nirvâ*n*a.

   <span id="6:19"></span>19. 'This, O Bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth of
Suffering: Birth is suffering; decay is suffering; illness is suffering;
death is suffering. Presence of objects we hate, is suffering;
Separation from objects we love, is suffering; not to obtain what we
desire, is suffering. Briefly, the fivefold clinging to existence<span
id="page_95_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_95_note_1.md) is suffering.

   <span id="6:20"></span>20. 'This, O Bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth of
the Cause of suffering: Thirst, that leads to re-birth, accornpanied by
pleasure and lust, finding its delight here and there. (This thirst is
threefold), namely, thirst for pleasure, thirst for existence, thirst
for prosperity.

   <span id="6:21"></span>21. 'This, O Bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth of
the Cessation of suffering: (It ceases with) the complete cessation of
this thirst,--a cessation which consists in the absence of every
passion,--with the abandoning of this thirst, with the doing away with
it, with the deliverance from it, with the destruction of desire.

   <span id="6:22"></span>22. 'This, O Bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth of
the Path which leads to the cessation of suffering: <span
id="page_96">p. 96</span> that holy eightfold Path, that is to say,
Right Belief, Right Aspiration, Right Speech, Right Conduct, Right Means
of Livelihood, Right Endeavour, Right Memory, Right Meditation.

   <span id="6:23"></span>23. '"This is the Noble Truth of
Suffering;"--thus, O Bhikkhus, of this doctrine, which formerly had not
been heard of, have I obtained insight, knowledge, understanding,
wisdom, intuition. "This Noble Truth of Suffering must be understood,"
thus, O Bhikkhus, of this doctrine, . . . . (&c., down to intuition).
"This Noble Truth of Suffering I have understood," thus, O Bhikkhus, of
this doctrine, . . . . (&c.,down to intuition).

   <span id="6:24"></span>24. '"This is the Noble Truth of the Cause of
suffering," thus, O Bhikkhus, (&c.) "This Noble Truth of the Cause of
suffering must be abandoned<span id="page_96_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span

me," thus, O Bhikkhus, (&c.)

   <span id="6:25"></span>25. '"This is the Noble Truth of the Cessation
of suffering," thus, O Bhikkhus, (&c.) "This Noble Truth of the
Cessation of suffering must be seen face to face . . . . has been seen
by me face to face," thus, O Bhikkhus, (&c.)

   <span id="6:26"></span>26. '"This is the Noble Truth of the Path
which leads to the cessation of suffering," thus, O Bhikkhus, (&c.)
"This Noble Truth of the Path which leads to the cessation of suffering,
must be realised has been realised by me," thus, O Bhikkhus, (&c.)

   <span id="6:27"></span>27. 'As long, O Bhikkhus, as I did not possess
with perfect purity this true knowledge and insight into these four
Noble Truths, with its three modifications <span id="page_97">p.
97</span> and its twelve constituent parts<span
id="page_97_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_97_note_1.md); so long, O Bhikkhus, I
knew that I had not yet obtained the highest, absolute Sambodhi in the
world of men and gods, in Mâra's and Brahma's world, among all beings,
Sama*n*as and Brâhma*n*as, gods and men.

   <span id="6:28"></span>28. 'But since I possessed, O Bhikkhus, with
perfect purity this true knowledge and insight into these four Noble
Truths, with its three modifications and its twelve constituent parts,
then I knew, O Bhikkhus, that I had obtained the highest, universal
Sambodhi in the world of men and gods, . . . . (&c., as in § 27).

   <span id="6:29"></span>29. 'And this knowledge and insight arose in
my mind: "The emancipation of my mind cannot be lost; this is my last
birth; hence I shall not be born again!"'

   Thus the Blessed One spoke. The five Bhikkhus were delighted, and
they rejoiced at the words of the Blessed One. And when this exposition
was propounded, the venerable Ko*nd*a*ññ*a obtained the pure and
spotless Eye of the Truth (that is to say, the following knowledge):
'Whatsoever is subject to the condition of origination, is subject also
to the condition of cessation.'

   <span id="6:30"></span>30. And as the Blessed One had founded the
Kingdom of Truth (by propounding the four Noble Truths), the
earth-inhabiting devas shouted: 'Truly the Blessed One has founded at
Benares, in the deer park Isipatana, the highest kingdom of Truth, which
may be opposed neither by a Sama*n*a nor by a Brâhma*n*a, neither by a
deva, nor by Mâra, nor by Brahma, nor by any being in the world.'

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

   Hearing the shout of the earth-inhabiting devas, the
*k*âtumahârâ*g*ika devas (gods belonging to the world of the four divine
mahârâ*g*as) shouted, . . . . (&c., as above). Hearing the shout of the
*k*âtumahârâ*g*ika devas, the tâvati*m*sa devas<span
id="page_98_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_98_note_1.md), the yâma devas, the
tusita devas, the nimmânarati devas, the paranimmitavasavatti devas, the
brahmakâyika devas shouted: 'Truly the Blessed One, . . . .' (&c., as
above).

   <span id="6:31"></span>31. Thus in that moment, in that instant, in
that second the shout reached the Brahma world; and this whole system of
ten thousand worlds quaked, was shaken, and trembled; and an infinite,
mighty light was seen through the world, which surpassed the light that
can be produced by the divine power of the devas.

   And the Blessed One pronounced this solemn utterance: 'Truly
Ko*nd*a*ññ*a has perceived it ("a*ññ*âsi"), truly Ko*nd*a*ññ*a has
perceived it!' Hence the venerable Ko*nd*a*ññ*a received the name
A*ññ*âtako*nd*a*ññ*a (Ko*nd*a*ññ*a who has perceived the doctrine).

   <span id="6:32"></span>32. And the venerable A*ññ*âtako*nd*a*ññ*a,
having seen the Truth, having mastered the Truth, having understood the
Truth, having penetrated the Truth, having overcome uncertainty, having
dispelled all doubts, having gained full knowledge, dependent on nobody
else for knowledge of the doctrine of the Teacher, thus spoke to the
Blessed One: 'Lord, let <span id="page_99">p. 99</span> me receive the
pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ ordinations from the Blessed One.'

   'Come, O Bhikkhu,' said the Blessed One, 'well taught is the
doctrine; lead a holy life for the sake of the complete extinction of
suffering.' Thus this venerable person received the upasampadâ
ordination.

   <span id="6:33"></span>33. And the Blessed One administered to the
other Bhikkhus exhortation and instruction by discourses relating to the
Dhamma. And the venerable Vappa, and the venerable Bhaddiya, when they
received from the Blessed One such exhortation and instruction by
discourses relating to the Dhamma, obtained the pure and spotless Eye of
the Truth (that is to say, the following knowledge): 'Whatsoever is
subject to the condition of origination is subject also to the condition
of cessation.'

   <span id="6:34"></span>34. And having seen the Truth, having mastered
the Truth, . . . . (&c., as in § 32), they thus spoke to the Blessed
One: 'Lord, let us receive the pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ ordinations
from the Blessed One.'

   'Come, O Bhikkhus,' said the Blessed One, 'well taught is the
doctrine; lead a holy life for the sake of the complete extinction of
suffering.' Thus these venerable persons received the upasampadâ
ordination.

   <span id="6:35"></span>35. And the Blessed One, living on what the
Bhikkhus brought him, administered to the other Bhikkhus exhortation and
instruction by discourse relating to the Dhamma; in this way the six
persons lived on what the three Bhikkhus<span
id="page_99_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_99_note_1.md) brought home from their
alms pilgrimage.

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

   <span id="6:36"></span><span id="6:37"></span>36, 37. And the
venerable Mahânâma and the venerable Assa*g*i, when they received from
the Blessed One, . . . . (&c., as in §§ 33, 34, down to:). Thus these
venerable persons received the upasampadâ ordination.

   <span id="6:38"></span>38. And the Blessed One thus spoke to the five
Bhikkhus: 'The body (Rûpa), O Bhikkhus, is not the self. If the body, O
Bhikkhus, were the self, the body would not be subject to disease, and
we should be able to say: "Let my body be such and such a one, let my
body not be such and such a one." But since the body, O Bhikkhus, is not
the self, therefore the body is subject to disease, and we are not able
to say: "Let my body be such and such a one, let my body not be such and
such a one."

   <span id="6:39"></span><span id="6:40"></span><span
id="6:41"></span>39-41. 'Sensation (Vedanâ), O Bhikkhus, is not the
self, . . . . (&c.<span id="page_100_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span

   <span id="6:42"></span>42. 'Now what do you think, O Bhikkhus, is the
body permanent or perishable?'

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

   'It is perishable, Lord.'

   'And that which isperishable, does that cause pain or joy?'

   'It causes pain, Lord.'

   'And that which is perishable, painful, subject to change, is it
possible to regard that in this way: 'This is mine, this am I, this is
my self?'

   'That is impossible, Lord.'

   <span id="6:43"></span>43. 'Is sensation permanent or perishable?' .
. . . (&c.<span id="page_101_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_101_note_1).md)

   <span id="6:44"></span>44. 'Therefore, O Bhikkhus, whatever body has
been, will be, and is now, belonging or not belonging to sentient
beings, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, distant or near, all that
body is not mine, is not me, is not my self: thus it should be
considered by right knowledge according to the truth.

   <span id="6:45"></span>45. 'Whatever sensation, . . . . (&c.<span
id="page_101_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span

   <span id="6:46"></span>46. 'Considering this, O Bhikkhus, a learned,
noble hearer of the word becomes weary of body, weary of sensation,
weary of perception, weary of the Sa*m*khâras, weary of consciousness.
Becoming weary of all that, he divests himself of passion; by absence of
passion he is made free; when he is free, he becomes aware that he is
free; and he realises that re-birth is exhausted; that holiness is
completed; that duty is fulfilled; and that there is no further return
to this world<span id="page_101_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_101_note_3.md).'

   <span id="6:47"></span>47. Thus the Blessed One spoke; the five
Bhikkhus were delighted, and rejoiced at the words of the Blessed One.
And when this exposition had been <span id="page_102">p. 102</span>
propounded, the minds of the five Bhikkhus became free from attachment
to the world, and were released from the Âsavas<span
id="page_102_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_102_note_1.md).

   At that time there were six Arahats (persons who had reached absolute
holiness) in the world.

End of the first Bhâ*n*avâra.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="7"></span>7<span id="page_102_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_102_note_2.md).

   <span id="7:1"></span>1. At that time there was in Benares a noble
youth, Yasa by name, the son of a se*tth*i (or treasurer<span
id="page_102_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_102_note_3).md) and delicately
nurtured. He had three palaces, one for winter, one for summer, one for
the rainy season. In the palace for the rainy season he lived during the
four months (of that season), surrounded with female musicians among
whom no <span id="page_103">p. 103</span> man was, and he did not
descend from that palace (all that time). Now one day Yasa, the noble
youth, who was endowed with, and possessed of the five pleasures of
sense<span id="page_103_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_103_note_1.md), while he was attended
(by those female musicians), fell asleep sooner than usual; and after
him his attendants also fell asleep. Now an oil lamp was burning through
the whole night.

   <span id="7:2"></span>2. And Yasa, the noble youth, awoke sooner than
usual; and he saw his attendants sleeping; one had her lute leaning
against her arm-pit; one had her tabor leaning against her neck; one had
her drum leaning against her arm-pit; one had dishevelled hair; one had
saliva flowing from her mouth; and they were muttering in their sleep.
One would think it was a cemetery one had fallen into<span
id="page_103_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_103_note_2.md). When he saw that, the
evils (of the life he led) manifested themselves to him; his mind became
weary (of worldly pleasures). And Yasa, the noble youth, gave utterance
to this solemn exclamation: 'Alas! what distress; alas! what danger!'

   <span id="7:3"></span>3. And Yasa, the noble youth, put on his gilt
slippers, and went to the gate of his house. Non-human beings opened the
gate, in order that no being might prevent Yasa the noble youth's
leaving the world, and going forth into the houseless state. And Yasa,
the noble youth, went to the gate of the city. Non-human beings opened
the gate, in order that no being might prevent Yasa the noble youth's
leaving the world, and going forth into the houseless state. And Yasa,
the noble youth, went to the deer park Isipatana.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

   <span id="7:4"></span>4. At that time the Blessed One, having arisen
in the night, at dawn was walking up and down in the open air. And the
Blessed One saw Yasa, the noble youth, coming from afar. And when he saw
him, he left the place where he was walking, and sat down on a seat laid
out (for him). And Yasa, the noble youth, gave utterance near the
Blessed One to that solemn exclamation: 'Alas! what distress; alas! what
danger!' And the Blessed One said to Yasa, the noble youth: 'Here is no
distress, Yasa, here is no danger. Come here, Yasa, sit down; I will
teach you the Truth (Dhamma).'

   <span id="7:5"></span>5. And Yasa, the noble youth, when he heard
that there was no distress, and that there was no danger, became glad
and joyful; and he put off his gilt slippers, and went to the place
where the Blessed One was; having approached him and having respectfully
saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him. When Yasa, the noble
youth, was sitting near him, the Blessed One preached to him in due
course: that is to say, he talked about the merits obtained by
alms-giving, about the duties of morality, about heaven, about the
evils, the vanity, and the sinfulness of desires, and about the
blessings of the abandonment of desire<span
id="page_104_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_104_note_1.md).

   <span id="7:6"></span>6. When the Blessed One saw that the mind of
Yasa, the noble youth, was prepared, impressible, free from obstacles
(to understanding the Truth), elated, and believing, then he preached
what is the principal doctrine of the Buddhas, namely, Suffering, <span
id="page_105">p. 105</span> the Cause of stiffering, the Cessation of
suffering, the Path. Just as a clean cloth free from black specks
properly takes the dye, thus Yasa, the noble youth, even while sitting
there, obtained the pure and spotless Eye of the Truth (that is, the
knowledge): 'Whatsoever is subject to the condition of origination is
subject also to the condition of cessation.'

   <span id="7:7"></span>7. Now the mother of Yasa, the noble youth,
having gone up to his palace, did not see Yasa, the noble youth, and she
went to the se*tth*i, the householder (her husband), and having
approached him, she said to the se*tth*i, the householder: 'Your son
Yasa, O householder, has disappeared.' Then the se*tth*i, the
householder, sent messengers on horseback to the four quarters of the
horizon; and he went himself to the deer park Isipatana. Then the
se*tth*i, the householder, saw on the ground the marks of the gilt
slippers; and when he saw them, he followed them up.

   <span id="7:8"></span>8. And the Blessed One saw the se*tth*i, the
householder, coming from afar. On seeing him, he thought: 'What if I
were to effect such an exercise of miraculous power, that the se*tth*i,
the householder, sitting here, should not see Yasa, the noble youth, who
is sitting here also.' And the Blessed One effected such an exercise of
his miraculous power.

   <span id="7:9"></span>9. And the se*tth*i, the householder, went to
the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him, he said to
the Blessed One: 'Pray, Lord, has the Blessed One seen Yasa, the noble
youth?'

   'Well, householder, sit down. Perhaps, sitting here, you may see
Yasa, the noble youth, sitting here also.'

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

   And the se*tth*i, the householder, who thought: 'Indeed, sitting here
I shall see Yasa, the noble youth, sitting here also I became glad and
joyful, and having respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down
near him.

   <span id="7:10"></span>10. When the se*tth*i, the householder, was
sitting near him, the Blessed One preached to him in due course; that is
to say, he talked about the merits obtained by alms-giving, . . . .
(&c., as at end of § 5). And the se*tth*i, the householder, having seen
the Truth, having mastered the Truth, having penetrated the Truth,
having overcome uncertainty, having dispelled all doubts, having gained
full knowledge, dependent on nobody else for the knowledge of the
doctrine of the Teacher, said to the Blessed One: 'Glorious, Lord!
glorious, Lord! Just as if one should set up, Lord, what had been
overturned, or should reveal what had been hidden, or should point out
the way to one who had lost his way, or should bring a lamp into the
darkness, in order that those who had eyes might see visible things,
thus has the Blessed One preached the doctrine in many ways. I take my
refuge, Lord, in the Blessed One, and in the Dhamma, and in the
fraternity of Bhikkhus; may the Blessed One receive me from this day
forth while my life lasts as a disciple who has taken his refuge in
Him.'

   This was the first person in the world who became a lay-disciple by
the formula of the holy triad

   <span id="7:11"></span>11. And Yasa, the noble youth, while
instruction was administered (by the Buddha) to his father, contemplated
the stage of knowledge which he had seen with his mind and understood;
and his mind became free from attachment to the world, and was <span
id="page_107">p. 107</span> released from the Âsavas. Then the Blessed
One thought: 'Yasa, the noble youth, while instruction was administered
to his father, has contemplated the stage of knowledge which he had seen
with his mind and understood; and his mind has become free from
attachment to the world, and has become released from the Âsavas. It is
impossible that Yasa, the noble youth, should return to the world and
enjoy pleasures, as he did before, when he lived in his house. What if I
were now to put an end to that exertion of my miraculous power.' And the
Blessed One put an end to that exertion of his miraculous Power.

   <span id="7:12"></span>12. Then the se*tth*i, the householder, saw
Yasa, the noble youth, sitting there. On seeing him he said to Yasa, the
noble youth: 'My son Yasa, your mother is absorbed in lamentation and
grief; restore your mother to life.'

   <span id="7:13"></span>13. Then Yasa, the noble youth, looked at the
Blessed One. And the Blessed One said to the se*tth*i, the householder:
'What do you think then, O householder? That Yasa has (first) won only
an imperfect<span id="page_107_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_107_note_1.md) degree of knowledge and
insight into the Truth, as you have yourself? Or that rather he was
contemplating the stage of knowledge which he had seen with his mind and
understood; and that his mind has thus become free from attachment to
the world, and has become released from the Âsavas? Now would it then be
possible, O householder, that Yasa should return to the world and enjoy
pleasures as he did before, when he lived in his house?'

   'Not so, Lord.' <span id="page_108">p. 108</span> 'Yasa, the noble
youth, O householder, had (first) won, like yourself, an imperfect
degree of knowledge and insight into the Truth. But when he was
contemplating the stage of knowledge which he had seen with his mind and
understood, his mind has become free from attachment to the world, and
has become released from the Âsavas. It is impossible, O householder,
that Yasa, the noble youth, should return to the world and enjoy
pleasures as he did before, when he lived in his house.'

   <span id="7:14"></span>14. 'It is all gain, Lord, to Yasa, the noble
youth, it is high bliss, Lord, for Yasa, the noble youth, that the mind
of Yasa, the noble youth, has become free from attachment to the world,
and has become released from the Âsavas. Might, Lord, the Blessed One
consent to take his meal with me to-day together with Yasa, the noble
youth, as his attendant?'

   The Blessed One expressed his consent by remaining silent. Then the
se*tth*i, the householder, when he understood that the Blessed One had
accepted his invitation, rose from his seat, respectfully saluted the
Blessed One, and passing round him with his right side towards him,
departed thence.

   <span id="7:15"></span>15. And Vasâ, the noble youth, soon after the
se*tth*i, the householder, was gone, said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, let
me receive the pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ ordinations from the Blessed
One.'

   'Come, O Bhikkhu,' said the Blessed One, 'well taught is the
doctrine; lead a holy life for the sake of the complete extinction of
suffering.'

   Thus this venerable person received the upasampadâ ordination. At
that time there were seven Arahats in the world.

### <span id="8"></span>8.

   <span id="8:1"></span>1. And in the forenoon the blessed One, having
put on his under-robes<span id="page_109_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_109_note_1.md), took his alms-bowl,
and, with his *k*îvara on, went with the venerable Yasa as his attendant
to the house of the se*tth*i, the householder. When he had arrived
there, he sat down on a seat laid out for him. Then the mother and the
former wife of the venerable Yasa went to the place where the Blessed
One was; having approached him and having respectfully saluted the
Blessed One. they sat down near him.

   <span id="8:2"></span>2. Then the Blessed One preached to them in due
course; that is to say, he talked about the merits obtained by
alms-giving, . . . . (&c., as in chap. 7. 5, 6, down to:); thus they
obtained, while sitting there, the pure and spotless Eye of theTruth
(that is, the knowledge): 'Whatsoever is subject to the condition of
origination is subject also to the condition of cessation.'

   <span id="8:3"></span>3. And having seen the Truth, . . . . (&c., as
above, §§ 5, 6, down to:), dependent on nobody else for knowledge of the
Teacher's doctrine, they thus spoke to the Blessed One: 'Glorious, Lord!
glorious Lord! Just as if one should set up' (&c., as in chap. 7. 10,
down to:). We take our refuge, Lord, in the Blessed One, and in the
Dhamma, and in the fraternity of Bhikkhus; may the Blessed One receive
us from this day forth, while our life lasts, as disciples who have
taken their refuge in Him.'

   These were the first females in the world who became lay-disciples by
the formula of the holy triad.

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

   <span id="8:4"></span>4. And the mother and the father and the former
wife of the venerable Yasa with their own hands served and offered<span
id="page_110_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_110_note_1.md) excellent food, both
hard and soft, to the Blessed One and to the venerable Yasa; and when
the Blessed One had finished his meal, and cleansed his bowl and his
hands, they sat down near him. Then the Blessed One taught, incited,
animated, and gladdened the mother, and father, and the former wife of
the venerable Yasa by religious discourse; and then he rose from his
seat and went away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="9"></span>9.

   <span id="9:1"></span>1. Now four lay persons, friends of the
venerable Yasa, belonging to the se*tth*i families of Benares, and to
the highest after the se*tth*i families, by name Vimala, Subâhu,
Pu*nn*a*g*i, and Gavampati, heard: 'Yasa, the noble youth, has cut off
his hair and beard, and has put on yellow robes, and has given up the
world, and gone forth into the houseless state.' When they had heard
that, they thought: 'Surely that cannot be a common doctrine and
discipline, that cannot be a common renunciation of the world, if Yasa,
the noble youth, has cut off his hair and beard, and has put on yellow
robes, and has given up the world, and gone forth into the houseless
state.'

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

   <span id="9:2"></span>2. Those four persons went to the place where
the venerable Yasa was; having approached him and having respectfully
saluted the venerable Yasa, they stood by his side. And the venerable
Yasa went with his four lay-friends to the place where the Blessed One
was; having approached him and having respectfully saluted the Blessed
One, he sat down near him. Sitting near him the venerable Yasa said to
the Blessed One: 'Lord, here are four lay-friends of mine, belonging to
the se*tth*i families of Benares and to the highest after the se*tth*i
families; their names are Vimala, Subâhu, Pu*nn*a*g*i, and Gavampati.
May the Blessed One administer exhortation and. instruction to these
four persons.

   <span id="9:3"></span>3. Then the Blessed One preached to them, . . .
. (&c., as in chap. 8. 2).

   <span id="9:4"></span>4. And having seen the Truth, . . . . (&c.,
down to:) dependent on nobody else for the knowledge of the Teacher's
doctrine, they thus spoke to the Blessed One: 'Lord, let us receive the
pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ ordinations from the Blessed One.'

   'Come, O Bhikkhus,' said the Blessed One, 'well taught is the
doctrine; lead a holy life for the sake of the complete extinction of
suffering.'

   Thus these venerable persons received the upasampadâ ordination. And
the Blessed One administered to these Bhikkhus exhortation and
instruction by discourse relating to the Dhamma. While they received
exhortation and instruction from the Blessed One by discourse relating
to the Dhamma. their minds became free from attachment to the world, and
were released from the Âsavas.

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

   At that time there were eleven Arahats in the world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here ends the story of the ordination of the four laymen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="10"></span>10.

   Now fifty lay persons, friends of the venerable Yasa, belonging to
the highest families in the country and to those next to the highest,
heard, . . . . ( &c., as in chap. 9, §§ 1, 2, 3, 4, down to:). While
they received exhortation and instruction from the Blessed One by
discourse relating to the Dhamma, their minds became free from
attachment to the world, and were released from the Âsavas.

   At that time there were sixty-one Arahats in the world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="11"></span>11.

   <span id="11:1"></span>1. And the Blessed One said to the Bhikkhus:
'I am delivered, O Bhikkhus, from all fetters, human and divine. You, O
Bhikkhus, are also delivered from all fetters, human and divine. Go ye
now, O Bhikkhus, and wander, for the gain of the many, for the welfare
of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the good, for the
gain, and for the welfare of gods and men, Let not two of you go the
same way<span id="page_112_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_112_note_1.md), Preach, O Bhikkhus, the
doctrine <span id="page_113">p. 113</span> which is glorious in the
beginning, glorious in the middle, glorious at the end, in the spirit
and in the letter; proclaim a consummate, perfect, and pure life of
holiness. There are beings whose mental eyes are covered by scarcely any
dust, but if the doctrine is not preached to them, they cannot attain
salvation. They will understand the doctrine. And I will go also, O
Bhikkhus, to Uruvelâ, to Senâninigama<span
id="page_113_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_113_note_1.md), in order to preach the
doctrine.'

   <span id="11:2"></span>2. And Mâra the wicked One went to the place
where the Blessed One was; having approached him, he addressed the
Blessed One in the following stanza: 'Thou art bound by all fetters,
human and divine. Thou art bound by strong fetters. Thou wilt not be
delivered from me, O Sama*n*a.'

   Buddha replied: 'I am delivered from all fetters, human and divine. I
am delivered from the strong fetters. Thou art struck down, O Death.'

   (Mâra said): 'The fetter which pervades the sky, with which mind is
bound, with that fetter I will bind thee. Thou wilt not be delivered
from me, O Sama*n*a.'

   (Buddha replied): 'Whatever forms, sounds, odours, flavours, or
contacts there are which please the <span id="page_114">p. 114</span>
senses, in me desire for them has ceased. Thou art struck down, O
Death.'

   Then Mâra the wicked One understood: 'The Blessed One knows me, the
perfect One knows me,' and, sad and afflicted, he vanished away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here ends the story of Mâra.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="12"></span>12.

   <span id="12:1"></span>1. At that time the Bhikkhus brought (to
Buddha), from different regions and different countries, persons who
desired to obtain the pabba*gg*â andupasampadâ ordinations, thinking:
'The Blessed One will confer on them the pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ
ordinations.' Thus both the Bhikkhus became tired (from the journey),
and also those who desired to obtain the pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ
ordinations. Now when the Blessed One was alone and had retired into
solitude, the following consideration presented itself to his mind: 'The
Bhikkhus now bring to me from different regions and different countries
persons who desire to obtain the pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ ordinations,
thinking: "The Blessed One will confer on them the pabba*gg*â and
upasampadâ ordinations." Now both the Bhikkhus become tired, and also
those who desire to obtain the pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ ordinations.
What if I were to grant permission to the Bhikkhus, saying: "Confer
henceforth, O Bhikkhus, in the different regions, and in the different
countries, the pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ ordinations yourselves (on
those who desire to receive them)."'

   <span id="12:2"></span>2. And the Blessed One, having left the
solitude <span id="page_115">p. 115</span> in the evening, in
consequence of that, and on this occasion, after having delivered a
religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'When I was alone, a
Bhikkhus, and had retired into solitude, the following consideration,
&c. What if I were to permit, . . . .' (&c., as in § 1).

   <span id="12:3"></span>3. 'I grant you, O Bhikkhus, this permission:
Confer henceforth in the different regions and in the different
countries the pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ ordinations yourselves (on those
who desire to receive them). And you ought, O Bhikkhus, to confer the
pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ ordinations in this way: Let him (who desires
to receive the ordination), first have his hair and beard cut off; let
him put on yellow robes, adjust his upper robe so as to cover one
shoulder, salute the feet of the Bhikkhus (with his head), and sit down
squatting; then let him raise his joined hands and tell him to say:

   <span id="12:4"></span>4. '"I take my refuge in the Buddha, I take my
refuge in the Dhamma, I take my refuge in the Sa*m*gha. And for the
second time I take (&c. . . . . Sa*m*gha). And for the third time I take
my refuge in the Buddha, and for the third time I take my refuge in the
Dhamma, and for the third time I take my refuge in the Sa*m*gha."

   'I prescribe, a Bhikkhus, the pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ ordinations
consisting in the three times repeated declaration of taking refuge (in
the holy triad).'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

End of the account of the upasampadâ ordination by the threefold
declaration of taking refuge<span id="page_115_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

### <span id="13"></span>13.

   <span id="13:1"></span>1. And the Blessed One, after having kept the
vassa residence<span id="page_116_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_116_note_1.md), thus addressed the
Bhikkhus: 'By wise contemplation, O Bhikkhus, and by wise firmness of
exertion have I attained the highest emancipation, have I realised the
highest emancipation. Attain ye also, O Bhikkhus, the highest
emancipation, realise the highest emancipation, by wise contemplation
and by wise firmness of exertion.'

   <span id="13:2"></span>2. And Mâra the wicked One went to the place
where the Blessed One was; having approached him, he addressed the
Blessed One by the following stanza: 'Thou art bound by Mâra's fetters,
human and divine. Thou art bound by strong fetters. Thou wilt not be
delivered from me, O Sama*n*a.'

   (Buddha replied): 'I am delivered from Mâra's fetters, human and
divine. I am delivered from the strong fetters. Thou art struck down; O
Death.'

   Then Mâra the wicked One understood: 'The Blessed One knows me, the
perfect One knows me;' and, sad and afflicted, he vanished away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="14"></span>14.

   <span id="14:1"></span>1. And the Blessed One, after having dwelt at
Benares as long as he thought fit, went forth to Uruvelâ. And the
Blessed One left the road and went to a certain grove; having gone
there, and having entered it, he sat down at the foot of a tree. At that
time there was a party of thirty friends, rich young men, who were
sporting in that same grove <span id="page_117">p. 117</span> together
with their wives. One of them had no wife; for him they had procured a
harlot. Now while they did not pay attention, and were indulging in
their sports, that harlot took up the articles belonging to them, and
ran away.

   <span id="14:2"></span>2. Then those companions, doing service to
their friend, went in search of that woman; and, roaming about that
grove, they saw the Blessed One sitting at the foot of a tree. Seeing
him they went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached
him, they said to the Blessed One: 'Pray, Lord, has the Blessed One seen
a woman passing by?'

   'What have you to do, young men, with the woman?'

   'We were sporting, Lord, in this grove, thirty friends, rich young
men, together with our wives. One of us had no wife; for him we had
procured a harlot. Now, Lord, while we did not pay attention, and were
indulging in our sports, that harlot has taken up the articles belonging
to us, and has run away. Therefore, Lord, we companions, doing service
to our friend, go in search of that woman, and roam about this grove.'

   <span id="14:3"></span>3. 'Now what think you, young men? Which would
be the better for you; that you should go in search of a woman, or that
you should go in search of yourselves?'

   'That, Lord, would be the better for us, that we should go in search
of ourselves.'

   'If so, young men, sit down, I will preach to you the Truth
(Dhamma).'

   The rich young companions replied: 'Yes, Lord,' and respectfully
saluted the Blessed One, and sat down near him.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

   <span id="14:4"></span>4. Then the Blessed One preached to them, . .
. . (&c., as in chap. 8. 2, or 9. 3).

   <span id="14:5"></span>5. And having seen the Truth, . . . . (&c., as
in chap. 9. 4 down to:). Thus these venerable persons received the
upasampadâ ordination.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here ends the story of the thirty rich young companions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

End of the second Bhâ*n*avâra.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="15"></span>15.

   <span id="15:1"></span>1. And the Blessed One, wandering from place
to place, came to Uruvelâ. At that time there lived in Uruvelâ three
*G*a*t*ilas<span id="page_118_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_118_note_1.md), Uruvelâ Kassapa, Nadî
Kassapa (Kassapa of the River, i.e. the Nera*ñg*arâ), and Gayâ Kassapa
(Kassapa of the village Gayâ.). Of these the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa
was chief, leader, foremost, first, and highest over five hundred
*G*a*t*ilas; Nadî Kassapa was chief . . . . (&c., down to highest over)
three hundred *G*a*t*ilas, Gayâ Kassapa was chief (&c., down to highest
over) two hundred *G*a*t*ilas.

   <span id="15:2"></span>2. And the Blessed One went to the hermitage
of <span id="page_119">p. 119</span> the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa;
having gone there, he said to the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa: 'If it is
not disagreeable to you, Kassapa, let me spend one night in the room
where your (sacred) fire is kept.'

   'It is not disagreeable to me, great Sama*n*a, but there is a savage
Nâga (or Serpent) king of great magical power<span
id="page_119_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_119_note_1.md), a dreadfully venomous
serpent; let him do no harm to you.'

   And a second time the Blessed One said to the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ
Kassapa: 'If it is not disagreeable,' &c. . . . .

   'It is not disagreeable,' &c.

   And a third time the Blessed One said: 'If it not disagreeable,' &c.
. . . .

   'It is not disagreeable,' &c. . . . .

   'He is not likely to do any harm to me. Pray, Kassapa, allow me a
place in the room where your fire is kept.'

   'Stay there, great Sama*n*a, as you wish it.'

   <span id="15:3"></span>3. Then the Blessed One entered the room where
the fire was kept, made himself a couch of grass, and sat down
cross-legged, keeping the body erect and surrounding himself with
watchfulness of mind<span id="page_119_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_119_note_2.md). And the Nâga saw that
the Blessed One had entered; when he saw that, he became annoyed, and
irritated, and sent forth a cloud of smoke. Then the Blessed One
thought: 'What if I were to leave intact the skin, and hide, and flesh,
and ligaments, and bones, <span id="page_120">p. 120</span> and marrow
of this Nâga; but were to conquer the fire, which he will send forth, by
my fire.'

   <span id="15:4"></span>4. And the Blessed One effected the
appropriate exercise of miraculous power and sent forth a cloud of
smoke. Then the Nâga, who could not master his rage<span
id="page_120_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_120_note_1.md), sent forth flames. And
the Blessed One, converting his body into fire<span
id="page_120_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_120_note_2.md), sent forth flames. When
they both shone forth with their flames, the fire room looked as if it
were burning and blazing, as if it were all in flames. And the
*G*a*t*ilas, surrounding the fire room, said: 'Truly, the countenance of
the great Sama*n*a is beautiful, but the Nâga will do harm to him<span
id="page_120_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_120_note_3.md).'

   <span id="15:5"></span>5. That night having elapsed, the Blessed One,
leaving intact the skin and hide and flesh and ligaments and bones and
marrow of that Nâga, and conquering the Nâga's fire by his fire, threw
him into his alms-bowl, and showed him to the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa
(saying), 'Here you see the Nâga, Kassapa; his fire has been conquered
by my fire.' Then the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa thought: 'Truly the
great Sama*n*a possesses high magical powers and great faculties, in
that he is able to conquer by his fire the fire of that savage Nâga
king, who is possessed of magical power, that dreadfully venomous
serpent. He is not, however, holy (arahâ) as I am.'

   <span id="15:6"></span>6<span id="page_120_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_120_note_4.md). Near the Nera*ñg*arâ
river the Blessed One <span id="page_121">p. 121</span> said to the
*G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa: 'If it is not disagreeable to you, Kassapa,
let me dwell this moonlight night in your fire room.'

   'It is not disagreeable to me, great Sama*n*a, but in your own behalf
I warn you off. There is a savage Snake king there possessed of magical
power, a dreadfully venomous serpent; let him do no harm to you.'

   'He is not likely to do any harm to me; pray, Kassapa, allow me a
place in your fire room.'

   When he saw that Kassapa had given his permission, fearlessly He, who
had overcome all fear, entered. When the chief of Serpents saw that the
Sage had entered, he became irritated, and sent forth a cloud of smoke.
Then the chief of men<span id="page_121_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_121_note_1.md), joyful and unperplexed,
also sent forth a cloud of smoke. Unable to master his rage, the chief
of Serpents sent forth flames like a burning fire. Then the chief of
men<span id="page_121_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_121_note_1.md), the perfect master of
the element of fire, also sent forth flames. When they shone forth both
with their flames, the *G*a*t*ilas looked at the fire room (saying),
'Truly the countenance of the great Sama*n*a is beautiful, but the Nâga
will do harm to him.'

   <span id="15:7"></span>7. And when that night had elapsed, the flames
of the Nâga were extinguished, but the various-coloured flames of Him
who is possessed of magical powers remained. Dark blue and red, light
red, yellow, and crystal-coloured flames of various colours <span
id="page_122">p. 122</span> appeared on the A<u>n</u>girasa's<span
id="page_122_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_122_note_1.md) body. Having put the
chief of Serpents into his alms-bowl, he showed him to the Brâhma*n*a
(saying), 'Here you see the Nâga, Kassapa; his fire has been conquered
by my fire.'

   And the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa, having conceived an affection for
the Blessed One in consequence of this wonder, said to the Blessed One:
'Stay with me, great Sama*n*a, I will daily provide you with food.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

End of the first Wonder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="16"></span>16.

   <span id="16:1"></span>1. And the Blessed One resided in a certain
grove near the hermitage of the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa. And on a
beautiful night the four Mahârâ*g*as<span
id="page_122_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_122_note_2.md), filling the whole grove
with light by the brilliancy of their complexion, went to the place
where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully
saluted the Blessed One, they stood in the four directions like great
firebrands.

   <span id="16:2"></span>2. And when that night had elapsed, the
*G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa went to the place where the Blessed One was;
having approached him, he said to the Blessed One: 'It is time, great
Sama*n*a, the meal is ready. Who were they, great Sama*n*a, who came,
this beautiful night, filling the whole grove with light by the
brilliancy of their complexion, to <span id="page_123">p. 123</span> the
place where you were, and having approached you and respectfully saluted
you, stood in the four directions like great firebrands?'

   'They were the four Mahârâ*g*as, Kassapa, who came to me in order to
hearmy preaching.'

   Then the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa thought: 'Truly the great
Sama*n*a possesses high magical powers and great faculties, since even
the four Mahârâ*g*as come to hear his preaching. He is not, however,
holy like me.'

   And the Blessed One ate the food offered by the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ
Kassapa, and continued to stay in that same grove.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

End of the second Wonder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="17"></span>17.

   <span id="17:1"></span>1. And on a beautiful night Sakka (Sakra or
Indra) the king of the devas, filling the whole grove with light by the
brilliancy of his complexion, went to the place where the Blessed One
was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he
stood near him like a great firebrand, surpassing in beauty and
brilliancy the splendour of the former appearances.

   <span id="17:2"></span>2. And when that night had elapsed (&c., as in
chap. 16. 2).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

End of the third Wonder.

   And on a beautiful night Brahmâ Sahampati (&c., as in chap. 17).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

End of the fourth Wonder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="19"></span>19.

   <span id="19:1"></span>1. At that time a great sacrifice which the
*G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa used to celebrate was approaching, and all
the people of A<u>n</u>ga and Magadha wished to go to that sacrifice
carrying abundant food, both hard and soft. Now the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ
Kassapa thought: 'Presently my great sacrifice is approaching, and all
the people of A<u>n</u>ga and Magadha will come and bring with them
abundant food, both hard and soft. If the great Sama*n*a should perform
a wonder before that great assembly, gain and honour would increase to
the great Sama*n*a, and my gain and honour would diminish. Well, the
great Sama*n*a shall not appear here to-morrow.'

   <span id="19:2"></span>2. Then the Blessed One, understanding by the
power of his mind this reflection which had arisen in the mind of the
*G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa, went to Uttara Kuru; having begged alms
there, he took the food (he had received) to the Anotatta lake<span
id="page_124_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_124_note_1.md); there he took his meal
and rested during the heat of the day at the same place.

   And when the night had elapsed, the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa went
to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him, he said
to the <span id="page_125">p. 125</span> Blessed One: 'It is time, great
Sama*n*a, the meal is ready. Why did you not come yesterday, great
Sama*n*a? We have thought of you: "Why does the great Sama*n*a not
come?" and your portions of food, both hard and soft, were served up for
you.'

   <span id="19:3"></span>3. (Buddha replied): 'Did you not think,
Kassapa: "Presently my great sacrifice (&c., as above down to:). Well,
the great Sama*n*a shall not appear here tomorrow?"

   <span id="19:4"></span>4. 'Now I understood, Kassapa, by the power of
my mind this reflection which had arisen in your mind, and I went to
Uttara Kuru; having begged alms there, I took the food to the Anotatta
lake; there I took my meal and rested during the heat of the day at the
same place.'

   Then the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa thought: 'Truly the great
Sama*n*a possesses high magical powers and great faculties, since he is
able to understand by the power of his mind the thoughts of other
people. He is not, however, holy like fie.' And the Blessed One ate
(&c., as in chap. 16, 2).

### <span id="20"></span>20.

   <span id="20:1"></span>1. At that time the Blessed One had rags taken
from a dust heap (of which he was going to make himiself a dress). Now
the Blessed One thought: 'Where shall I wash these rags?' Then Sakka the
king of the devas, understanding in his mind the thought which had
arisen in the mind of the Blessed One, dug a tank with his own hand,
<span id="page_126">p. 126</span> and said to the Blessed One: 'Lord,
might the Blessed One wash the rags here.'

   And the Blessed One thought: 'What shall I rub the rags upon?' Then
Sakka the king of the devas, understanding, &c., put there a great stone
and said: 'Lord, might the Blessed One rob the rags upon this stone.'

   <span id="20:2"></span>2. And the Blessed One thought: 'What shall I
take hold of when going up (from the tank)?' Then a deity that resided
in a Kakudha tree, understanding, &c., bent down a branch and said:
'Lord, might the Blessed One take hold of this branch when going up
(from the tank).'

   And the Blessed One thought: 'What shall I lay the rags upon (in
order to dry them)?' Then Sakka the king of the devas, understanding,
&c., put there a great stone and sald: 'Lord, might the Blessed One lay
the rags upon this stone.'

   <span id="20:3"></span>3. And when that night had elapsed, the
*G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa went to the place where the Blessed One was;
having approached him, he said to the Blessed One: 'It is time, great
Sama*n*a, the meal is ready. What is this, great Sama*n*a? Formerly
there was here no tank, and now here is this tank. Formerly no stone was
put here; by whom has this stone been put here? Formerly this Kakudha
tree did not bend down its branch, and now this branch is bent down.'

   <span id="20:4"></span>4. 'I had rags, Kassapa, taken from a dust
heap; and I thought, Kassapa: "Where shall I wash these rags?" Then,
Kassapa, Sakka the king of the devas, understanciing in his mind the
thought which had arisen in my mind, dug a tank with his hand and said
to me: "Lord, might the Blessed One wash the <span id="page_127">p.
127</span> rags here." Thus this tank has been dug by the hand of a
non-human being.

   'And I thought, Kassapa: "What shall I rub the rags upon?" Then,
Kassapa, Sakka, &c. Thus this stone has been put here by a non-human
being.

   <span id="20:5"></span>5. 'And I thought, Kassapa: "What shall I take
hold of when going up (from the tank)?" Then, Kassapa, a deity, &c. Thus
this Kakudha tree has served me as a hold for my hand.

   'And I thought, Kassapa: "Where shall I lay the rags upon (in order
to dry them)?" Then, Kassapa, Sakka, &c. Thus this stone has been put
here by a non-human being.'

   <span id="20:6"></span>6. Then the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa
thought: 'Truly the great Sama*n*a possesses high magical powers and
great faculties, since Sakka the king of the devas does service to him.
He is not, however, holy like me.'

   And the Blessed One ate (&c., as in chap. 16. 2 ).

   <span id="20:7"></span>7. And when that night had elapsed, the
*G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa went to the place where the Blessed One was;
having approached him, he announced to the Blessed One that it was time,
by saying, 'It is time, great Sama*n*a, the meal is ready.'

   (Buddha replied): 'Go you, Kassapa; I will follow you.'

   Having thus sent away the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa, he went to
pluck a fruit from the *g*ambu tree after which this continent of
*G*ambudîpa (the Gambu Island, or India) is named<span
id="page_127_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_127_note_1.md); then arriving before
<span id="page_128">p. 128</span> Kassapa he sat down in the room where
Kassapa's (sacred) fire was kept<span
id="page_128_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_128_note_1.md).

   <span id="20:8"></span>8. Then the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa saw the
Blessed One sitting in the fire room; seeing him he said to the Blessed
One: 'By what way have you come, great Sama*n*a? I have departed before
you, and you have arrived before me and are sitting in the fire room.'

   <span id="20:9"></span>9. 'When I had sent you away, Kassapa, I went
to pluck a fruit from the garnbu tree after which this continent of
*G*ambudîpa is named; then I arrived before you and sat down in the fire
room. Here is the *g*ambu fruit, Kassapa, it is beautiful, fragrant, and
full of flavour; you may eat it, if you like.'

   'Nay, great Sama*n*a, to you alone it is becoming to eat it; eat it
yourself.'

   And the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa thought: 'Truly the great Sama*n*a
possesses high magical powers and great faculties, since he is able,
having sent me away before him, to go and pluck a fruit from the *g*ambu
tree after which this continent of *G*ambudîpa is named, and then to
arrive before me and to sit down in the fire room. He is not however,
holy like me.'

   And the Blessed One ate (&c., as in chap. 16. 2).

   <span id="20:10"></span>10. And when that night had elapsed (&c., as
in § 7, down to:). Having thus sent away the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa,
he went to pluck a fruit from a mango tree growing near the *g*ambu tree
after which this continent of *G*ambudîpa is named, &c. He <span
id="page_129">p. 129</span> went to pluck a fruit from an emblic
myrobalan tree, &c., from a yellow myrobalan tree growing near the
*g*ambu tree, &c. He went to the Tâvatimsa heaven to pluck a
pâri*kkh*attaka (or pâri*g*âtaka) flower; then arriving before Kassapa
he sat down in the fire room. Then the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa saw
(&c., as in § 8).

   <span id="20:11"></span>11. 'When I had sent you away, Kassapa, I
went to the Tâvatimsa heaven to pluck a pâri*kkh*attaka flower; then I
arrived before you and sat down in the fire room. Here is the
pâri*kkh*attaka flower, Kassapa; it is beautiful and fragrant; you may
take it, if you like.'

   'Nay, great Sama*n*a, to you alone it is becoming to keep it; keep it
yourself.'

   And the *G*a*t*ila (&c., as in § 9). 'He is not, however, holy as I
am.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   <span id="20:12"></span>12. At that time one day the *G*a*t*ilas, who
wished to attend on their sacred fires, could not succeed in splitting
fire-wood. Now these *G*a*t*ilas thought:

   'Doubtless this is the magical power and the high faculty of the
great Sama*n*a that we cannot succeed in splitting fire-wood.' Then the
Blessed One said to the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa: 'Shall the fire-wood
be split, Kassapa?'

   'Let it be split, great Sama*n*a.'

   Then in a moment the five hundred pieces of fire-wood<span
id="page_129_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_129_note_1.md) were split. And the
*G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ <span id="page_130">p. 130</span> Kassapa thought:
'Truly the great Sama*n*a possesses high magical powers and great
faculties, since even the fire-wood splits itself (at his command). He
is not, however, holy like me.'

   <span id="20:13"></span>13. At that time the *G*a*t*ilas who wished
to attend on their sacred fires, could not succeed in lighting up the
fires (&c., as in the preceding story).

   <span id="20:14"></span>14. At that time the *G*a*t*ilas, after
having attended on their sacred fires, could not succeed in
extinguishing the fires (&c., as above).

   <span id="20:15"></span>15. At that time in the cold winter nights,
in the time between the ash*t*akâ festivals<span
id="page_130_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_130_note_1.md), when snow falls, the
*G*a*t*ilas plunged into the river Nera*ñg*arâ, and emerged again, and
repeatedly plunged into the water and emerged. And the Blessed One
created five hundred vessels with burning fire<span
id="page_130_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_130_note_2.md); at those the
*G*a*t*ilas coming out of the river warmed themselves. And the
*G*a*t*ilas thought: 'Doubtless this is the magical power and the high
faculty of the great Sama*n*a that these vessels with fire have been
caused to appear here.' And the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa thought:
'Truly the great Sama*n*a possesses high magical powers and great
faculties, since he can create such great vessels with fire. He is not,
however, holy like me.'

   <span id="20:16"></span>16. At that time a great rain fell out of
season; and a great inundation arose. The place where the Blessed One
livcd was covered with water. Then <span id="page_131">p. 131</span> the
Blessed One thought: 'What if I were to cause the water to recede round
about, and if I were to walk up and down in the midst of the water on a
dust-covered spot.' And the Blessed One caused the water to recede round
about, and he walked up and down in the midst of the water on a
dust-covered spot.

   And the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa, who was afraid that the water
might have carried away the great Sama*n*a, went with a boat together
with many *G*a*t*ilas to the place where the Blessed One lived. Then the
*G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa saw the Blessed One, who had caused the water
to recede round about, walking up and down in the midst of the water on
a dust-covered spot. Seeing him, he said to the Blessed One: 'Are you
there, great Sama*n*a?'

   'Here I am, Kassapa,' replied the Blessed One, and he rose in the air
and stationed himself in the boat.

   And the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa thought: 'Truly the great Sama*n*a
possesses high magical powers and great faculties, since the water does
not carry him away. He is not, however, holy like me.'

   <span id="20:17"></span>17. Then the Blessed One thought: 'This
foolish man will still for a long time think thus: "Truly the great
Sama*n*a possesses high magical powers and great faculties; he is not,
however, holy like me." What if I were to move the mind of this
*G*a*t*ila (in order to show him my superiority).'

   And the Blessed One said to the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa: 'You are
not holy (arahâ), Kassapa, nor have you entered the path of Arahatship,
nor do you walk in such a practice as will lead you to Arahatship. or to
entering the path of Arahatship.'

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

   Then the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ. Kassapa prostrated himself, inclining
his head to the feet of the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One:
'Lord, let me receive the pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ ordinations from the
Blessed One.'

   <span id="20:18"></span>18. (Buddha replied): 'You, Kassapa, are
chief, leader, foremost, first, and highest of five hundred *G*a*t*ilas;
go first and inform them of your intention, and let them do what they
think fit.'

   Then the *G*a*t*ila Uruvelâ Kassapa went to those *G*a*t*ilas; having
gone to them, he said to those *G*a*t*ilas: 'I wish, Sirs, to lead a
religious life under the direction of the great Sama*n*a; you may do,
Sirs, what you think fit.'

   (The *G*a*t*ilas replied): 'We have conceived, Sir, an affection for
the great Sama*n*a long since; if you will lead. Sir, a religious life
under the great Sama*n*a' s direction; we will all lead a religious life
under the great Sama*n*a's direction.'

   <span id="20:19"></span>19. Then the *G*a*t*ilas flung their
hair<span id="page_132_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_132_note_1.md), their braids, their
provisions<span id="page_132_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_132_note_2.md), and the things for the
agnihotra sacrifice into the river, and went to the place where the
Blessed One was; having approached him and prostrated themselves before
him, inclining their heads to the feet of the Blessed One, they said to
the Blessed One: 'Lord, let us receive the pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ
ordinations from the Blessed One.'

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

   'Come, O Bhikkhus,' said the Blessed One, 'well taught is the
doctrine; lead a holy life for the sake of the complete extinction of
suffering.'

   Thus these venerable persons received the upasampadâ ordination.

   <span id="20:20"></span>20. And the *G*a*t*ila Nadî Kassapa saw the
hair, the braids, the provisions, the things for the agnihotra
sacrifice, which were carried down by the river; when he saw that, he
became afraid that some misfortune might have befallen his brother. He
sent some *G*a*t*ilas, saying, 'Go and look after my brother,' and went
himself with his three hundred *G*a*t*ilas to the venerable Uruvelâ
Kassapa; having approached him, he said to the venerable Uruvelâ
Kassapa: 'Now, Kassapa, is this bliss?'

   (Uruvelâ Kassapa replied): 'Yes, friend, this is bliss.'

   <span id="20:21"></span>21. And the *G*a*t*ilas (who had come with
Nadî Kassapa) (&c., as in § 19).

   <span id="20:22"></span>22. And the *G*a*t*ila Gayâ Kassapa saw (&c.,
as in § 20); when he saw that, he became afraid that some misfortune
might have befallen his brothers. He sent some *G*a*t*ilas, saying, 'Go
and look after my brothers,' and went himself with his two hundred
*G*a*t*ilas to the venerable Uruvelâ Kassapa (&c., as above).

   <span id="20:23"></span>23. And the *G*a*t*ilas (who had come with
Gayâ Kassapa) (&c., as in § 19).

   <span id="20:24"></span>24. <span
id="page_133_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_133_note_1.md)At the command of the
Blessed One the five hundred pieces of fire-wood could not be split and
were split, the fires could not be lit up and <span id="page_134">p.
134</span> were lit up, could not be extinguished and were extinguished;
besides he created five hundred vessels with fire. Thus the number of
these miracles amounts to three thousand five hundred.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="21"></span>21.

   <span id="21:1"></span>1. And the Blessed One, after having dwelt at
Uruvelâ as long as he thought fit, went forth to Gayâsîsa<span
id="page_134_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_134_note_1.md), accompanied by a great
number of Bhikkhus, by one thousand Bhikkhus who all had been
*G*a*t*ilas before. There near Gayâ, at Gayâsîsa, the Blessed One dwelt
together with those thousand Bhikkhus.

   <span id="21:2"></span>2. There the Blessed One thus addressed the
Bhikkhus: 'Everything, O Bhikkhus, is burning. And how, O Bhikkhus, is
everything burning?

   'The eye, O Bhikkhus, is burning; visible things are burning; the
mental impressions based on the eye are burning; the contact of the eye
(with visible things) is burning; the sensation produced by the contact
of the eye (with visible things), be it pleasant, be it painful, be it
neither pleasant nor painful, that also is burning. With what fire is it
burning? I declare unto you that it is burning with the fire of lust,
with the fire of anger, with the fire of ignorance; it is burning with
(the anxieties of) birth, decay, death, grief, lamentation, suffering,
dejection, and despair.

   <span id="21:3"></span>3. 'The ear is burning, sounds are burning,
&c. . . . . The nose is burning, odours are burning, &c. <span
id="page_135">p. 135</span> . . . . The tongue is burning, tastes are
burning, &c. . . . . The body is burning, objects of contact are
burning, &c. . . . . The mind is burning, thoughts are burning, &c. . .
. .<span id="page_135_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_135_note_1.md)

   <span id="21:4"></span>4. 'Considering this, O Bhikkhus, a disciple
learned (in the scriptures), walking in the Noble Path, becomes weary of
the eye, weary of visible things, weary of the mental impressions based
on the eye, weary of the contact of the eye (with visible things), weary
also of the sensation produced by the contact of the eye (with visible
things), be it pleasant, be it painful, be it neither pleasant nor
painful. He becomes weary of the ear (&c. . . . . , down to . . . .
thoughts<span id="page_135_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_135_note_1).md). Becoming weary of all
that, he divests himself of passion; by absence of passion he is made
free; when he is free, he becomes aware that he is free; and he realises
that re-birth is exhausted; that holiness is completed; that duty is
fulfilled; and that there is no further return to this world.'

   When this exposition was propounded, the minds of those thousand
Bhikkhus became free from attachment to the world, and were released
from the Âsavas.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here ends the sermon on 'The Burning.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

End of the third Bhâ*n*avâra concerning the Wonders done at Uruvelâ.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

### <span id="22"></span>22.

   <span id="22:1"></span>1. And the Blessed One, after having dwelt at
Gayâsisa as long as he thought fit, went forth to Râ*g*aha, accompanied
by a great number of Bhikkhus, by one thousand Bhikkhus who all had been
*G*a*t*ilas before. And the Blessed One, wandering from place to place,
came to Râ*g*agaha. There the Blessed One dwelt near Râ*g*agaha, in the
La*tth*ivana pleasure garden, near the sacred shrine of
Supati*tth*a<span id="page_136_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_136_note_1.md).

   <span id="22:2"></span>2. Then the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra
heard: 'The Sama*n*a Gotama Sakyaputta, an ascetic of the Sakya tribe,
has just arrived at Râ*g*agaha and is staying near Râ*g*agaha, in the
La*tth*ivana pleasure garden, near the sacred shrine of Supati*tth*a. Of
Him the blessed Gotama such a glorious fame is spread abroad: "Truly he
is the blessed, holy, absolute Sambuddha, endowed with knowledge and
conduct, the most happy One, who understands all worlds, the highest
One, who guides men as a driver curbs a bullock, the teacher of gods and
men, the blessed Buddha. He makes known the Truth, which he has
understood himself and seen face to face, to this world system with its
devas, its Mâras, and its Brahmâs; to all beings, Sama*n*as and
Brâhma*n*as, <span id="page_137">p. 137</span> gods and men; he preaches
that Truth (Dhamma) which is glorious in the beginning, glorious in the
middle, glorious at the end, in the spirit and in the letter; he
proclaims a consummate, perfect, and pure life." It is good to obtain
the sight of holy men (Arahats) like that.'

   <span id="22:3"></span>3. And the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra,
surrounded by twelve myriads of Magadha Brâhma*n*as and
householders<span id="page_137_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_137_note_1.md), went to the place where
the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the
Blessed One, he sat down near him. And of those twelve myriads of
Magadha Brâhma*n*as and householders some also respectfully saluted the
Blessed One and sat down near him; some exchanged greeting with the
Blessed One, having exchanged with him greeting and complaisant words,
they sat down near him; some bent their clasped hands towards the
Blessed One and sat down near him; some shouted out their name and their
family name before the Blessed One and sat down near him; some silently
sat down near him.

   <span id="22:4"></span>4. Now those twelve myriads of Magadha
Brâhma*n*as and householders thought: 'How now is this? has the great
Sama*n*a placed himself under the spiritual direction of Uruvelâ
Kassapa, or has Uruvelâ Kassapa placed himself under the spiritual
direction of the great Sama*n*a?'

   And the Blessed One, who understood in his mind the reflection which
had arisen in the minds of those twelve myriads of Magadha Brâhma*n*as
and householders, addressed the venerable Uruvelâ Kassapa <span
id="page_138">p. 138</span> in this stanza: 'What knowledge have you
gained, O inhabitant of Uruvelâ, that has induced you, who were renowned
for your penances<span id="page_138_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_138_note_1.md), to forsake your sacred
fire? I ask you, Kassapa, this question: How is it that your fire
sacrifice has become deserted?'

   (Kassapa replied): 'It is visible things and sounds, and also tastes,
pleasures and woman that the sacrifices speak of<span
id="page_138_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_138_note_2.md); because I understood
that whatever belongs to existence<span
id="page_138_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_138_note_3.md) is filth, therefore I
took no more delight in sacrifices and offerings<span
id="page_138_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_138_note_4.md).'

   <span id="22:5"></span>5. 'But if your mind, Kassapa (said the
Blessed One<span id="page_138_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_138_note_5).md), found there no more
delight,--either in visible things, or sounds, or tastes,--what is it in
the world of men or gods in which<span
id="page_138_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_138_note_6.md) your mind, Kassapa, now
finds delight? Tell me that.'

   (Kassapa replied): 'I have seen the state of peace (i.e. Nirvâ*n*a)
in which the basis of existence (upadhi<span
id="page_138_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_138_note_3).md) and the obstacles to
perfection <span id="page_139">p. 139</span> (ki*ñk*ana<span
id="page_139_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_139_note_1).md) have ceased, which is
free from attachment to sensual existence, which cannot pass over into
another state, which cannot be led to another state; therefore I took no
more delight in sacrifices and offerings.'

   <span id="22:6"></span>6. Then the venerable Uruvelâ Kassapa rose
from his seat, adjusted his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder,
prostrated himself, inclining his head to the feet of the Blessed One,
and said to the Blessed One: 'My teacher, Lord, is the Blessed One, I am
his pupil; my teacher, Lord, is the Blessed One, I am his pupil.' Then
those twelve myriads of Magadha Brâhma*n*as and householders understood:
'Uruvelâ Kassapa has placed himself under the spiritual direction of the
great Sama*n*a.'

   <span id="22:7"></span><span id="22:8"></span>7, 8. And the Blessed
One, who understood in his mind the reflection that had arisen in the
minds of those twelve myriads of Magadha Brâhma*n*as and householders,
preached to them in due course (&c., as in chap. 7, §§ 5, 6, down to:).
Just as a clean cloth free from black specks properly takes the dye,
thus eleven myriads of those Magadha Brâhma*n*as and householders with
Bimbisâra at their head, while sitting there, obtained the pure and
spotless Eye of the Truth (that is, the knowledge): 'Whatsoever is
subject to the condition of origination is subject <span
id="page_140">p. 140</span> also to the condition of cessation.' One
myriad announced their having become lay-pupils.

   <span id="22:9"></span>9. Then the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra,
having seen the Truth (&c. . . . . down to) dependent on nobody else for
the knowledge of the Teacher's doctrine, said to the Blessed One: 'In
former days, Lord, when I was a prince, I entertained five wishes; these
are fulfilled now. In former days, Lord, when I was a prince, I wished:
"O that I might be inaugurated as king." This was my first wish, Lord;
this is fulfilled now. "And might then the holy, absolute Sambuddha come
into my kingdom." This was my second wish, Lord; this is fulfilled now.

   <span id="22:10"></span>10. '"And might I pay my respects to Him, the
Blessed One." This was my third wish, Lord; this is fulfilled now. "And
might He the Blessed One preach his doctrine (Dhamma) to me." This was
my fourth wish, Lord; this is fulfilled now. "And might I understand
His, the Blessed One's doctrine." This was my fifth wish, Lord; this is
fulfilled now. These were the five wishes, Lord, which I entertalned in
former days when I was a prince; these are fulfilled now.

   <span id="22:11"></span>11. 'Glorious, Lord! (&c., as in chap. 7. 10,
down to:) who has taken his refuge in Him. And might the Blessed One,
Lord, consent to take his meal with me to-morrow together with the
fraternity of Bhikkhus.'

   The Blessed One expressed his consent by remaining silent.

   <span id="22:12"></span>12. Then the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra,
when he understood that the Blessed One had accepted his invitation,
rose from his seat, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, and, passing
round him with his right side towards him, went away. <span
id="page_141">p. 141</span> And when the night had elapsed, the Magadha
king Seniya Bimbisâra ordered excellent food, both hard and soft, to be
prepared, and had dinner-time announced to the Blessed One in the words:
'It is time, Lord, the meal is ready.' And in the forenoon the Blessed
One, having put on his under-robes, took his alms-bowl, and with his
*k*îvara on entered the city of Râ*g*agaha accompanied by a great number
of Bhikkhus, by one thousand Bhikkhus who all had been *G*a*t*ilas
before.

   <span id="22:13"></span>13. At that time Sakka the king of the devas,
assuming the appearance of a young Brâhman, walked in front of the
Bhikkhu fraternity with Buddha at its head, singing the following
stanzas: 'The self-controlled One with the self-controlled, with the
former *G*a*t*ilas, the released One with the released, the Blessed One,
gold-coloured like an ornament of si<u>n</u>gî gold<span
id="page_141_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_141_note_1.md), has entered Râ*g*agaha.

   'The emancipated One with the emancipated, with the former
*G*a*t*ilas, &c.

   'He who has crossed (the ocean of passion) with them who have crossed
(it), with the former *G*a*t*ilas, the released One with the released,
the Blessed One, gold-coloured like an ornament of si<u>n</u>gi go1d,
has entered Râ*g*agaha.

   'He who is possessed of the ten Noble States<span
id="page_141_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_141_note_2.md) <span id="page_142">p.
142</span> and of the ten Powers<span
id="page_142_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_142_note_1.md), who understands the ten
Paths of Kamma<span id="page_142_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_142_note_2.md) and possesses the ten
(attributes of Arahatship)<span id="page_142_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_142_note_3.md), the Blessed One,
surrounded by ten hundred of followers, has entered Râ*g*agaha.'

   <span id="22:14"></span>14. The people when they saw Sakka the king
of the devas, said: 'This youth indeed is handsome; this youth indeed
has a lovely appearance; this youth indeed is pleasing. Whose attendant
may this youth be?'

   When they talked thus, Sakka the king of the devas addressed those
people in this stanza: 'He who is wise, entirely self-controlled, the
unrivalled Buddha, tie Arahat, the most happy upon earth: his attendant
am I.'

   <span id="22:15"></span>15. And the Blessed One went to the palace of
the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra. Having gone there, he sat down with
the Bhikkhus who followed him, on seats laid out for them. Then the
Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra with his own hands served and offered
excellent food, both hard and soft, to the fraternity of Bhikkhus with
the Buddha at <span id="page_143">p. 143</span> its head; and when the
Blessed One had finished his meal and cleansed his bowl and his hands,
he sat down near him.

   <span id="22:16"></span>16. Sitting near him the Magadha king Seniya
Bimbisâra thought: 'Where may I find a place for the Blessed One to live
in, not too far from the town and not too near, suitable for going and
coming, easily accessible for all people who want (to see him), by day
not too crowded, at night not exposed to much noise and alarm, clean of
the smell of people, hidden from men, well fitted for a retired life?'

   <span id="22:17"></span>17. And the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra
thought: 'There is the Ve*l*uvana<span
id="page_143_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_143_note_1.md), my pleasure garden,
which is not too far from the town and not too near, suitable for going
and coming, . . . . (&c., down to a retired life). What if I were to
make an offering of the Ve*l*uvana pleasure garden to the fraternity of
Bhikkhus with the Buddha at its head?'

   <span id="22:18"></span>18. And the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra
took a golden vessel (with water in it, to be poured over the Buddha's
hand); and dedicated (the garden) to the Blessed One (by saying), 'I
give up this Ve*l*uvana pleasure garden, Lord, to the fraternity of
Bhikkhus with the Buddha at its head.' The Blessed One accepted the
ârâma (park). Then the Blessed One, after having taught, incited,
animated, and gladdened the Magadha king Seniya <span id="page_144">p.
144</span> Bimbisâra by religious discourse, rose from his seat and went
away.

   And in consequence of this event the Blessed One, after having
delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'I allow
you, O Bhikkhus, to receive the donation of an ârâma (a park).'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="23"></span>23.

   <span id="23:1"></span>1. At that time Sa*ñg*aya, a paribbâ*g*aka
(wandering ascetic), resided at Râ*g*agaha with a great retinue of
paribbâ*g*akas, with two hundred and fifty paribbâ*g*akas. At that time
Sâriputta and Moggallâna (two young Brâhma*n*as) led a religious life as
followers of Sa*ñg*aya the paribbâ*g*aka; these had given their word to
each other: 'He who first attains to the immortal (amata, i.e.
Nirvâ*n*a) shall tell the other one.'

   <span id="23:2"></span>2. Now one day the venerable Assa*g*i in the
forenoon, having put on his under-robes, and having taken his alms-bowl,
and with his *k*îvara on, entered the city of Râ*g*agaha for alms; his
walking, turning back, regarding, looking, drawing (his arms) back, and
stretching (them) out was decorous; he turned his eyes to the ground,
and was dignified in deportment. Now the paribbâ*g*aka Sâriputta saw the
venerable Assa*g*i, who went through Râ*g*agaha for alms, whose walking,
&c., was docorous, who kept his eyes on the ground, and was dignified in
deportment. Seeing him he thought: 'Indeed this person is one of those
Bhikkhus who are the worthy ones (Arahats) in the world, or who have
entered the path of Arahatship. What if I were to approach this Bhikkhu
and <span id="page_145">p. 145</span> to ask him: "In whose name,
friend, have you retired from the world? Who is your teacher? Whose
doctrine do you profess?"'

   <span id="23:3"></span>3. Now the paribbâ*g*aka Sâriputta thought:
'This is not the time to ask this Bhikkhu; he has entered the interior
yard of a house, walking for alms. What if I were to follow this Bhikkhu
step by step, according to the course recognised by those who want
something<span id="page_145_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_145_note_1.md).'

   And the venerable Assa*g*i, having finished his alms-pilgrimage
through Râ*g*agaha, went back with the food he had received. Then the
paribbâ*g*aka Sâriputta went to the place where the venerable Assa*g*i
was; having approached him, he exchanged greeting with the venerable
Assa*g*i; having exchanged with him greeting and complaisant words, he
stationed himself at his side; standing at his side the paribbâ*g*aka
Sâriputta said to the venerable Assa*g*i: 'Your countenance, friend, is
serene; your complexion is pure and bright. In whose name, friend, have
you retired from the world? Who is your teacher? Whose doctrine do you
profess<span id="page_145_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_145_note_2.md)?'

   <span id="23:4"></span>4. (Assa*g*i replied): 'There is, friend, the
great Sama*n*a Sakyaputta, an ascetic of the Sakya tribe; in His, the
Blessed One's, name have I retired from the world; He, the Blessed One,
is my teacher; and His, the Blessed One's, doctrine do I profess.'

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

   'And what is the doctrine, Sir, which your teacher holds, and
preaches to you?'

   'I am only a young disciple, friend; I have but recently received the
ordination; and I have newly adopted this doctrine and discipline. I
cannot explain to you the doctrine in detail; but I will tell you in
short what it means.'

   Then the paribbâ*g*aka Sâriputta said to the venerable Assa*g*i:
'Well, friend, tell me much or little as you like, but be sure to tell
me the spirit (of the doctrine); I want but the spirit; why do you make
so much of the letter?'

   <span id="23:5"></span>5. Then the venerable Assa*g*i pronounced to
the paribbâ*g*aka Sâriputta the following text of the Dhamma: 'Of all
objects which proceed from a cause, the Tathâgata has explained the
cause, and He has explained theîr cessation also; this is the doctrine
of the 'great Sama*n*a<span id="page_146_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_146_note_1.md).'

   And the paribbâ*g*aka 'Sâriputta after having heard this text
obtained the pure and spotless Eye of the Truth (that is, the following
knowledge): 'Whatsoever is subject to the condition of origination is
subject also to the condition of cessation.' (And he said): 'If this
alone be the Doctrine (the Dhamma), now you have reached up to the state
where all sorrow ceases (i.e. Nirvâ*n*a), (the state) which has remained
unseen <span id="page_147">p. 147</span> through many myriads of Kappas
(world-ages) of the past.'

   <span id="23:6"></span>6. Then the paribbâ*g*aka Sâriputta went to
the place where the paribbâ*g*aka Moggallâna was. And the paribbâ*g*aka
Moggallâna saw the paribbâ*g*aka Sâriputta coming from afar; seeing him
he said to the paribbâ*g*aka Sâriputta: 'Your countenance, friend, is
serene; your complexion is pure and bright. Have you then really reached
the immortal, friend?'

   'Yes, friend, I have attained to the immortal.'

   'And how, friend, have you done so?'

   <span id="23:7"></span><span id="23:8"></span><span
id="23:9"></span>7-9. 'I saw, friend, the Bhikkhu Assa*g*i who went
through Râ*g*agaha for alms (&c.<span
id="page_147_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_147_note_1), down to:.md); "But I will
tell you in short what it means."

   '"Tell me much or little as you like, but be sure to tell me the
spirit (of the doctrine); I want but the spirit; why do you make so much
of the letter?"

   <span id="23:10"></span>10. 'Then, friend, the Bhikkhu Assa*g*i
pronounced the following Dhamma sentence: "Of all objects which proceed
from a cause, the Tathâgata has explained the cause, and He has
explained their cessation also; this is the doctrine of the great
Sama*n*a."'

   And the paribbâ*g*aka Moggallâna, after having heard (&c., as in § 5,
down to the end).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="24"></span>24.

   <span id="24:1"></span>1. Then the paribbâ*g*aka Moggallâna said to
the paribbâ*g*aka Sâriputta: 'Let us go, friend, and join <span
id="page_148">p. 148</span> the Blessed One; that He, the Blessed One,
may be our teacher.'

   (Sâriputta replied): 'It is on our account, friend; that these two
hundred and fifty paribbâ*g*akas live here (as followers of Sa*ñg*aya),
and it is we whom they regard; let us first inform them also of our
intention; then they may do what they think fit.'

   Then Sâriputta and Moggallâna went to the place where those
paribbâ*g*akas were; having approached them, they said to the
paribbâ*g*akas: 'Friends, we are going to join the Blessed One; that He,
the Blessed One, may be our teacher.'

   (The paribbâ*g*akas replied): 'It is on your account, Sirs, that we
live here, and it is you whom we regard; if you, Sirs, are about to
place yourselves under the spiritual direction of the great Sama*n*a, we
all will place ourselves also under the spiritual direction of the great
Sama*n*a.'

   <span id="24:2"></span>2. Then Sâriputta and Moggallâna went to the
place where the paribbâ*g*aka Sa*ñg*aya was; having approached him, they
said to the paribbâ*g*aka Sa*ñg*aya: 'Friend, we are going to join the
Blessed One; that He, the Blessed One, may be our teacher.'

   (Sa*ñg*aya replied): 'Nay, friends, do not go; let us all three share
in the leadership of this body (of disciples).'

   And a second time Sâriputta and Moggallâna said, &c. And a third time
Sâriputta and Moggallâna said, &c. (And a third time he replied): 'Nay,
friends, do not go; let us all three share in the leadership of this
body (of disciples).'

   <span id="24:3"></span>3. But Sâriputta and Moggallâna took with them
those two hundred and fifty paribbâ*g*akas and went to the Ve*l*uvana.
But the paribbâ*g*aka Sa*ñg*aya <span id="page_149">p. 149</span> began,
on the spot, to vomit hot blood from his mouth<span
id="page_149_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_149_note_1.md).

   And the Blessed One saw them, Sâriputta and Moggallâna, coming from
afar; on seeing them he thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'There, O Bhikkhus,
two companions arrive, Kolita and U patissa<span
id="page_149_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_149_note_2.md); these will be a pair of
(true) pupils, a most distinguished, auspicious pair.

   When<span id="page_149_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_149_note_3.md) (Sâriputta and
Moggallâna), who had reached emancipation in the perfect destruction of
the substrata (of existence), which is a profound subject accessible
only to knowledge, came to the Ve*l*uvana, the Teacher, who saw them,
foretold about <span id="page_150">p. 150</span> them: 'These two
companions who are now coming--Kolita and Upatissa--these will be a pair
of (true) pupils, a most distinguished, auspicious pair.'

   <span id="24:4"></span>4. Then Sâriputta and Moggallâna went to the
place where the Blessed One was; having approached him, they prostrated
thernselves, inclining their heads to the feet of the Blessed One, and
said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, let us receive the pabba*gg*â and
upasampadâ ordinations from the Blessed One.'

   'Come, O Bhikkhus,' said the Blessed One, 'well taught is the
doctrine; lead a holy life for the sake of the complete extinction of
suffering.' Thus these venerable persons received the upasampadâ
ordination.

   <span id="24:5"></span>5. At that time many distinguished young
Magadha noblemen led a religious life under the direction of the Blessed
One. The people were annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), 'The
Sama*n*a Gotama causes fathers to beget no sons; the Sama*n*a Gotama
causes wives to become widows; the Sama*n*a Gotama causes families to
become extinct. Now he has ordained one thousand *G*a*t*ilas, and he has
ordained these two hundred and fifty paribbâ*g*akas who were followers
of Sa*ñg*aya; and these many distingtiished young Magadha noblemen are
now leading a religious life under the direction of the Sama*n*a
Gotama.' And moreover, when they saw the Bhikkhus, they reviled them in
the following stanza: 'The great Sama*n*a has come to Giribba*g*a (i.e.
Râ*g*agaha) of the Magadha people, leading with hi in all the follawers
of Sa*ñg*aya; who will be the next to be led by him?'

   <span id="24:6"></span>6. Some Bhikkhus heard those people that were
<span id="page_151">p. 151</span> annoyed, murmured, and had hecome
angry; these Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One. (He replied):
'This noise, O Bhikkhus, will not last long; it will last only seven
days; after seven days it will he over. And if they revile you, O
Bhikkhus, in this stanza: "The great Sama*n*a has come, &c.," you should
reply to the revilers in the following stanza: "It is by means of the
true doctrine that the great heroes, the Tathâgatas, lead men. Who will
murmur at the wise, who lead men by the power of the Truth?"'

   <span id="24:7"></span>7. At that time the people, when seeing the
Bhikkhus, reviled them in the following stanza: 'The great Sama*n*a has
come, &c.' Then the Bhikkhus replied to the revilers in the following
stanza: 'It is by means of the true doctrine, &c.'

   Then the people understood: 'It is by truth, and not by wrong, that
the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as lead men;' and thus that noise lasted only
seven days, and after seven days it was over.

Here ends the narration of the ordination of Sâriputta and Moggallâna.

End of the fourth Bhâ*n*avâra.

### <span id="25"></span>25<span id="page_151_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_151_note_1.md).

   <span id="25:1"></span>1. At that time some Bhikkhus, as they had no
upa*ggh*âyas (preceptors) and received no exhortation <span
id="page_152">p. 152</span> and instruction, went on their rounds for
alms wearing improper under and upper garments (or, wearing their under
and upper garments improperly), and in an improper attire. While people
were eating, they held out their alms-bowls in which were leavings of
food<span id="page_152_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_152_note_1.md), over the hard food
(which the people were eating), and held them out over soft food, and
held them out over savoury food, and held them out over drinks. They
asked for soup and boiled rice themselves, and ate it; in the dining
halls they made a great and loud noise.

   <span id="25:2"></span>2. The people were annoyed, murmured, and
became angry (saying), 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as go on their
rounds for alms wearing improper under and upper garments, . . . . (&c.,
as in § 1, down to drinks)? How can they make so great and loud a noise
in the dining halls? They behave like Brâhma*n*as at the dinners given
to them.'

   <span id="25:3"></span>3. Some Bhikkhus heard those people that were
annoyed, murmured, and had become angry. Those Bhikkhus who were
moderate, frugal, modest, conscientious, <span id="page_153">p.
153</span> anxious for training, were annoyed, murmured, and became
angry: 'How can the Bhikkhus go on their rounds for alms wearing
improper under and upper garments, &c.? How can they make so great and
loud a noise in the dining halls?'

   <span id="25:4"></span>4. These Bhikkhus told this thing to the
Blessed One.

   In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One, having
ordered the fraternity of Bhikkhus to assemble, questioned the Bhikkhus:
'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, that some Bhikkhus go on their rounds, . . . .
(&c., down to), that they make a great and loud noise in the dining
halls?'

   'It is true, Lord.'

   <span id="25:5"></span>5. Then the Blessed Buddha rebuked those
Bhikkhus: 'It is improper, O Bhikkhus, what these foolish persons are
doing, it is unbecoming, indecent, un worthy of Sama*n*as, unallowable,
and to be avoided. How can these foolish persons, O Bhikkhus, go on
their rounds, &c.? How can they make so great and loud a noise in the
dining halls? This will not do, O Bhikkhus, for converting the
unconverted, and for augmenting the number of the converted; but it will
result, O Bhikkhus, in the unconverted being repulsed (from the faith),
and in many of the converted being estranged.'

   <span id="25:6"></span>6. And the Blessed One rebuked those Bhikkhus
in many ways, spoke against unfrugality, ill-nature, immoderation,
insatiableness, delighting in society, and indolence; spoke in many ways
in praise of frugality, good-nature, of the moderate, contented, who
have eradicated (sin), who have shaken off (sin), of the gracious, of
the reverent, and of the energetic. And having delivered beforethe
Bhikkhus a religious <span id="page_154">p. 154</span> discourse in
accordance to, and in conformity with these subjects, he thus addressed
the Bhikkhus:

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, (that young Bhikkhus choose) an upa*ggh*âya
(or preceptor).

   'The upa*ggh*âya, O Bhikkhus, ought to consider the saddhivihârika
(i.e. pupil) as a son; the saddhivihârika ought to consider the
upa*ggh*âya as a father. Thus these two, united by mutual reverence,
confidence, and communion of life, will progress, advance, and reach a
high stage in this doctrine and discipline.

   <span id="25:7"></span>7. 'And let them choose, O Bhikkhus, an
upa*ggh*âya in this way: Let him (who is going to choose an upa*ggh*âya)
adjust his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, salute the feet (of
the intended upa*ggh*âya), sit down squatting, raise his joined hands,
and say: "Venerable Sir, be my upa*ggh*âya; venerable Sir, be my
upa*ggh*âya; venerable Sir, be my upa*ggh*âya." (If the other answer):
"Well," or, "Certainly," or, "Good," or, "All right," or, "Carry on
(your work) with friendliness (towards me)," or should he express this
by gesture (lit. by his body). or by word, or by gesture and word, then
the upa*ggh*âya has been chosen. If he does not express this by gesture,
nor by word, nor by gesture and word, the upa*ggh*âya has not been
chosen.

   <span id="25:8"></span>8. 'The saddhivihârika, O Bhikkhus, ought to
observe a strict conduct towards his upa*ggh*âya. And these are the
rules for his conduct: Let him arise betimes, and having taken off his
shoes<span id="page_154_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_154_note_1.md) and adjusted his upper
robe so as to cover one shoulder, <span id="page_155">p. 155</span> let
him give (to the upa*ggh*âya) the teeth-cleanser and water to rinse his
mouth with. Then let him prepare a seat (for the upa*ggh*âya). If there
is rice-milk, let him rinse the jug and offer the rice-milk (to the
upa*ggh*âya). When he has drunk it, let him give water (to the
upa*ggh*âya), take the jug, hold it down, rinse it properly without
(damaging it by) rubbing, and put it away. When the upa*ggh*âya has
risen, let him take away the seat. If the place is dirty, let him sweep
the place.

   <span id="25:9"></span>9. 'If the upa*ggh*âya wishes to go into the
village, let (the saddhivihârika) give (to the upa*ggh*âya) his under
garment, take (from him) his second under garment (i.e. his house-dress
?), give him his girdle, lay the two upper garments upon each other<span
id="page_155_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_155_note_1.md) and give them (to the
upa*ggh*âya), rinse the alms-bowl, and give it him with some water in
it. If the upa*ggh*âya wishes (to go with) an attendant Bhikkhu, let him
put on his under garment so as to conceal the three circles (viz. the
navel and the two knees) and as to cover the body all around; then let
him put on his girdle, lay the two upper garments upon each other and
put them on, tie the knots, take his alms-bowl, after having it rinsed,
and follow the upa*ggh*âya as his attendant. Let him not go too far
(from the upa*ggh*âya) nor too near. Let him take (from the upa*ggh*âya)
what has been put into his alms-bowl<span
id="page_155_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_155_note_2.md).

   <span id="25:10"></span>10. 'When the upa*ggh*âya speaks, let (the
saddhivihârika) <span id="page_156">p. 156</span> not interrupt him. If
the upa*ggh*âya is in danger of committing an offence by the words he
says, let (the saddhivihârika) keep him back. When (the upa*ggh*âya)
turns back (from his alms-pilgrimage), let the saddhivihârika go back
(to the Vihâra) before (the upa*ggh*âya), prepares seat, get water for
the washing of his feet, a foot-stool, and a towel<span

garment (his house-dress ?), and take his under garment. If the robe (of
the upa*ggh*âya) is wet with perspiration, let him dry it a while in a
hot place, but let him not leave the robe in a hot place. Let him fold
up the robe. When folding up the robe, let him fold it up so as to leave
(every day) four inches (more than the day before) hanging over at the
corners, in order that no fold may arise in the middle of it<span

   <span id="27:1"></span>1. At that time the saddhivihârikas did not
observe a proper conduct towards their upa*ggh*âyas. The moderate
Bhikkhus<span id="page_165_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span

   (Then Buddha questioned the Bhikkhus): 'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, that

Buddha rebuked those Bhikkhus: 'How can the saddhivihârikas, O Bhikkhus,
not observe a proper conduct towards their upa*ggh*âyas?' Having rebuked
them and delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the

O Bhikkhus, not forbear to observe a proper conduct towards <span

come back hither," or, "Take away your alms-bowl and robe," or, "I am
not to be attended by you any more." Whether he express this by gesture,
or by word, or by gesture and word, the saddhivihârika has then been
turned away. If he does not express this by gesture, nor by word, nor by

saddhivihârikas begged their pardon, would not forgive them. They told,
&c.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, forgiving.'

   Notwithstanding this they did not forgive. The saddhivihârikas went
away, or returned to the world, or went over to other schools. They
told, &c.

   'Let him who is asked for his pardon, not withhold it. He who does
not forgive, is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence:

the Bhikkhus and asked them for the pabba*gg*â ordination. The Bhikkhus
were not willing to ordain him. As he did not obtain the pabba*gg*â
ordination from the Bhikkhus, he became emaciated, lean, discoloured,
more and more livid, and the veins became visible all over his body.

   And the Blessed One saw this Brâhma*n*a, who had become emaciated,
&c. When he had seen him, he said to the Bhikkhus: 'How is it, O
Bhikkhus, that this Brâhma*n*a has become emaciated, &c.'

   'This Brâhma*n*a, Lord, came to the Bhikkhus and asked them for the
pabba*gg*â ordination (&c., as above, down to:), and the veins became

   <span id="28:2"></span>2. Then the Blessed One said to the Bhikkhus:
'Now, O Bhikkhus, who remembers anything about this Brâhma*n*a?'

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

   When he had spoken thus, the venerabIe Sâriputta said to the Blessed
One: 'I remember something, Lord, about this Brâhma*n*a.'

   'And what is it you remember, Sâriputta, about this Brâhma*n*a?'

   'This Brâhma*n*a, Lord, one day, when I went through Râ*g*agaha for
alms, ordered a spoonfuI of food to be given to me; this is what I
remember, Lord, about this Brâhma*n*a.'

   <span id="28:3"></span>3. 'Good, good, Sâriputta; pious men,
Sâriputta, are gratefuI and remember what has been done to them.
Therefore, Sâriputta, confer you the pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ
ordinations on that Brâhma*n*a.'

   'Lord, how shall I confer the pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ ordinations
on this Brâhma*n*a?'

   Then the Blessed One on this occasion, after having delivered a
religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'I abolish, O
Bhikkhus, from this day the upasampadâ ordination by the threefoId

### <span id="29"></span>29.

   <span id="29:1"></span>1. At that time a certain Bhikkhu shortly
after having received the upasampadâ ordination, abandoned <span
id="page_171">p. 171</span> himself to bad conduct. The Bhikkhus said to
him: 'You ought not to do so, friend; it is not becoming.'

   He replied: 'I never asked you, Sirs, saying, "Confer on me the
upasampadâ ordination." Why have you ordained me without your being
asked?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, ordain a person unless he has been asked to
do so. He who does, commits a dukka*t*a offence. I prescribe, O
Bhikkhus, that you ordain only after having been asked.

   <span id="29:2"></span>2. 'And (a Bhikkhu) ought to be asked in this
way: Let him who desires to receive the upasampadâ ordination, go to the
Sa*m*gha, adjust his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, salute the
feet of the Bhikkhus with his head, sit down squatting, raise his joined
hands, and say: "I ask the Sa*m*gha, reverend Sirs, for the upasampadâ
ordination; might the Sa*m*gha, reverend Sirs, draw me out (of the
sinful world) out of compassion towards me." And for the second time,
&c.; and for the third time let him ask, &c.

   <span id="29:3"></span>3. 'Then let a learned, competent Bhikkhu
proclaim the following *ñ*atti before the Sa*m*gha: "Let the Sa*m*gha,
reverend Sirs, hear me. This person N. N. desires to receive the
upasampadâ ordination from the venerable N. N.; N. N. asks the Sa*m*gha

### <span id="30"></span>30.

   <span id="30:1"></span>1. At that time an arrangement had been made
at Râ*g*agaha that the Bhikkhus were to receive excellent meals
successively (in the houses of different rich upâsakas). Now (one day) a
certain Brâhma*n*a thought: 'Indeed the precepts which these
Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as keep and the life they live are commodious; they
have good meals and lie down on beds protected from the wind<span
id="page_172_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_172_note_1.md). What if I were to
embrace the religious life among the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as?' Then this
Brâhma*n*a went to the Bhikkhus and asked them for the pabba*gg*â
ordination; the Bhikkhus conferred the pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ
ordinations on him.

   <span id="30:2"></span>2. When he had been ordained, the arrangement
of successive meals (with the rich upâsakas) came to an end. The
Bhikkhus said to him: 'Come, friend, let us now go on our rounds for
alms.'

   He replied: 'I have not embraced the religious life for that
purpose--to going about for alms; if you give me (food), I will eat; if
you do not, I will return to the world.'

   (The Bhikkhus said): 'What, friend! have you indeed embraced the
religious life for your belly's sake?'

   'Yes, friends.'

   <span id="30:3"></span>3. The moderate Bhikkhus were annoyed,
murmured, and became angry: 'How can a Bhikkhu embrace the religious
life in so well-taught a doctrine and discipline for his belly's sake?'

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

   These Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.

   (The Buddha said): 'Is it true, O Bhikkhu, that you have embraced the
religious life for your belly's sake?'

   (He replied): 'It is true, Lord.'

   Then the blessed Buddha rebuked that Bhikkhu: 'How can you, foolish
person that you are, embrace the religious life in so well-taught a
doctrine and discipline for your belly's sake? This will not do, O
foolish one, for converting the unconverted and for augmenting the
number of the converted.'

   Having rebuked him and delivered a religious discourse, he thus
addressed the Bhikkhus:

   <span id="30:4"></span>4. 'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that he who
confers the upasampadâ ordination (on a Bhikkhu), tell him the four
Resources.

   'The religious life has morsels of food given in alms for its
resource. Thus you must endeavour to live all your life. Meals given to
the Sa*m*gha, to certain persons, invitations, food distributed by
ticket, meals given each fortnight, each uposatha day (i.e. the last day
of each fortnight), or the first day of each fortnight, are extra
allowances.

   'The religious life has the robe made of rags taken from a dust heap
for its resource. Thus you must endeavour to live all your life. Linen,
cotton, silk, woollen garments, coarse cloth, hempen cloth are extra
allowances.

   'The religious life has dwelling at the foot of a tree for its
resource. Thus you must endeavour to live all your life. Vihâras,
a*ddh*ayogas, storied dwellings, attics, caves<span
id="page_173_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_173_note_1.md) are extra allowances.

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

   'The religious life has decomposing urine as medicine<span
id="page_174_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_174_note_1.md) for its resource. Thus
you must endeavour to live all your life. Ghee, butter, oil, honey, and
molasses are extra allowances.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here ends the fifth Bhâ*n*avâra, which contains the duties towards
upa*ggh*âyas.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="31"></span>31.

   <span id="31:1"></span>1. At that time a certain youth came to the
Bhikkhus and asked them to be ordained. The Bhikkhus told him the (four)
Resources before his ordination. Then he said: 'If you had told me the
Resources, venerable Sirs, after my ordination, I should have persisted
(in the religious life); but now, venerable Sirs, I will not be
ordained; the Resources are repulsive and loathsome to me.'

   The Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'You ought not, O Bhikkhus, to tell the Resources (to the candidates)
before their ordination. He who does, is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence.
I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you tell the Resources (to the
newly-ordained Bhikkhus) immediately after their upasampadâ.'

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

   <span id="31:2"></span>2. At that time some Bhikkhus performed the
upasampadâ service with a chapter of two or three Bhikkhus.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, receive the upasampadâ ordination before a
chapter of less than ten Bhikkhus. He who performs the upasampadâ
service (with a smaller number of Bhikkhus), is guilty of a dukka*t*a
offence. I prescribe you, O Bhikkhus, the holding of upasampadâ services
with a chapter of ten Bhikkhus or more than ten.'

   <span id="31:3"></span>3. At that time some Bhikkhus conferred the
upasampadâ ordination on their saddhivihârikas one or two years after
their own upasampadâ. <span id="page_175_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_175_note_1.md)Thus also the venerable
Upasena Va<u>n</u>gantaputta conferred the upasampadâ ordination on a
saddhivihârika of his one year after his own upasampadâ. When he had
concluded the vassa residence, after two years from his own upasampadâ
had elapsed, he went with his saddhivihârika, who had completed the
first year after his upasampadâ, to the place where the Blessed One was;
having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat
down near him.

   <span id="31:4"></span>4. Now it is the custom of the blessed Buddhas
to exchange greeting with incoming Bhikkhus. And the Blessed One said to
the venerable Upasena Va<u>n</u>gantaputta: 'Do things go well with you,
Bhikkhu? Do you get enough to support your life? Have you made your
journey with not too great fatigue?'

   'Things go pretty well with us, Lord; we get <span id="page_176">p.
176</span> enough, Lord, to support our life, and we have made our
journey, Lord, with not too great fatigue.' The Tathâgatas sometimes ask
about what they know; sometimes they do not ask about what they know.
They understand the right time when to ask, and they understand the
right time when not to ask. The Tathâgatas put questions full of sense,
not void of sense; to what is void of sense the bridge is pulled down
for the Tathâgatas. For two purposes the blessed Buddhas put questions
to the Bhikkhus, when they intend to preach the doctrine or when they
intend to institute a rule of conduct to their disciples.

   <span id="31:5"></span>5. And the Blessed One said to the venerable
Upananda Va<u>n</u>gantaputta: 'How many years have you completed, O
Bhikkhu, since your upasampadâ?'

   'Two years, Lord.'

   'And how many years has this Bhikkhu completed?'

   'One year, Lord.'

   'In what relation does this Bhikkhu stand to you?'

   'He is my saddhivihârika, Lord.'

   Then the blessed Buddha rebuked him: 'This is improper, O foolish
one, unbecoming, unsuitable, unworthy of a Sama*n*a, unallowable, and to
be avoided. How can you, O foolish one, who ought to receive exhortation
and instruction from others, think yourself fit for administering
exhortation and instruction to another Bhikkhu? Too quickly, O foolish
one, have you abandoned yourself to the ambition of collecting
followers. This will not do (&c.: as in chap. 30. 3). Let no one, O
Bhikkhus, confer the upasampadâ ordination who has not <span
id="page_177">p. 177</span> completed ten years. He who does, is guilty
of a dukka*t*a offence. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that only he who has
completed ten years or more than ten years, may confer the upasampadâ
ordination.'

   <span id="31:6"></span>6. At that time ignorant, unlearned Bhikkhus
(who said), 'We have completed ten years (since our upasampadâ), we have
completed ten years,' conferred the upasampadâ ordination; (thus)
ignorant upa*ggh*âyas were found and clever saddhivihârikas; unlearned
upa*ggh*âyas were found and learned saddhivihârikas; upa*ggh*âyas were
found who had small knowledge, and saddhivihârikas who had great
knowledge; foolish upa*ggh*âyas were found and wise saddhivihârikas. And
a certain Bhikkhu who had formerly belonged to a Titthiya school, when
his upa*ggh*âya remonstrated with him (on certain offences) according to
the Dhamma, brought his upa*ggh*âya (by reasoning) to silence and went
back to that same Titthiya school<span
id="page_177_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_177_note_1.md).

   <span id="31:7"></span>7. The moderate Bhikkhus were annoyed,
murmured, and became angry: 'How can those ignorant, unlearned Bhikkhus
confer the upasampadâ ordination (saying); "We have completed ten years,
we have completed ten years?" (Thus) ignorant upa*ggh*âyas are found and
clever saddhivihârikas (&c., down to:), foolish upa*ggh*âyas are found
and wise saddhivihârikas.'

   These Bhikkhus told, &c.

   'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, &c.?'

   'It is true, Lord.'

   <span id="31:8"></span>8. Then the blessed Buddha rebuked those
Bhikkhus: 'How can these foolish persons, O Bhikkhus, <span
id="page_178">p. 178</span> confer the upasampadâ ordination (saying),
"We have, &c?" (Thus) ignorant upa*ggh*âyas are found, &c. This will not
do, O Bhikkhus, for converting the unconverted and for augmenting the
number of the converted.'

   Having rebuked those Bhikkhus and delivered a religious discourse, he
thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'Let no ignorant, unlearned Bhikkhu, O
Bhikkhus, confer the upasampadâ ordination. If he does, he is guilty of
a dukka*t*a offence. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that only a learned,
competent Bhikkhu who has completed ten years, or more than ten years,
may confer the upasampadâ ordination.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="32"></span>32.

   <span id="32:1"></span>1. At that time some Bhikkhus whose
upa*ggh*âyas were gone away, or had returned to the world, or had died,
or were gone over to a (schismatic) faction<span
id="page_178_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_178_note_1.md), as they had no
â*k*ariyas and received no exhortation and instruction, went on their
rounds for alms wearing improper under and upper garments (&c., as in
chap. 25. 1-6, down to:), he thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'I prescribe,
O Bhikkhus, (that young Bhikkhus choose) an â*k*ariya<span
id="page_178_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_178_note_2.md).

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

   'The â*k*ariya, O Bhikkhus, ought to consider the antevâsika (i.e.
disciple) as a son; the antevâsika ought to consider the â*k*ariya as a
father. Thus these two, united by mutual reverence, confidence, and
communion of life, will progress, advance, and reach a high stage in
this doctrine and discipline.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you live (the first) ten years in
dependence (on an â*k*ariya); he who has completed his tenth year may
give a nissaya<span id="page_179_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_179_note_1.md) himself.

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

   <span id="32:2"></span>2. 'And let (the antevâsika), O Bhikkhus,
choose his â*k*ariya in this way: Let him adjust his upper robe so as to
cover one shoulder, salute the feet (of the â*k*ariya), sit down
squatting, raise his joined hands, and say: "Venerable Sir, be my
â*k*ariya, I will live in dependence on you, Sir."' (This formula is
repeated thrice.)

   '(If the other answers): "Well" (&c., as in chap. 25. 7).

   <span id="32:3"></span>3. 'The antevâsika, O Bhikkhus, ought to
observe a strict conduct towards his â*k*ariya' (&c., as in chap. 25.
8-24).

   'The â*k*ariya, O Bhikkhus, ought to observe a strict conduct towards
his antevâsika' (&c., as in chap. 26).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

End of the sixth Bhâ*n*avâra.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="34"></span>34.

   At that time the antevâsikas did not observe a proper conduct towards
their â*k*ariyas (&c., as in chap. 27. 1-8).

### <span id="35"></span>35.

   <span id="35:1"></span><span id="35:2"></span>1, 2. At that time
ignorant, unlearned Bhikkhus (who said), 'We have completed ten years
(since our upasampadâ), we have completed ten years,' gave a nissaya
(i.e. they received young Bhikkhus as their antevâsikas); (thus)
ignorant â*k*ariyas were found and clever antevâsikas; unlearned
â*k*ariyas were found and learned antevâsikas; â*k*ariyas were found who
had small knowIedge, and antevâsikas who had great knowledgc; foolish
â*k*ariyas were found and wise antevâsikas. The moderate Bhikkhus were
annoyed (&c., as in chap. 31, 7, 8).

   'Let no ignorant, unlearned Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, give a nissaya. If
he does, he is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus,
that only a learned, competent Bhikkhu who has completed ten years, or
more than ten years, may give a nissaya.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="36"></span>36.

   <span id="36:1"></span>1. At that time the Bhikkhus whose â*k*ariyas
and upa*ggh*âyas were gone away, or had returned to the worId, or had
died, or were gone over to a (schismatic) faction, were not acquainted
with (the rules about) the cessation of their nissayas<span
id="page_181_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_181_note_1.md). They told this thing to
the Blessed One.

   'There are five cases of cessation of a nissaya, O Bhikkhus, between

   'There are six cases of cessation of a nissaya, O Bhikkhus, between

upa*ggh*âya when he remonstrated with him according to the Dhamma, and
has returned to that same Titthiya school, must not receive the
upasampadâ ordination, if he comes back. On other persons, O Bhikkhus,
who have formerly belonged to Titthiya schools and desire to receive the
pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ ordinations in this doctrine and discipline,
you ought to impose a parivâsa (a probation-time) of four months.

   <span id="38:2"></span>2. 'And you ought, O Bhikkhus, to impose it in
this way: Let him (who desires to receive the ordination) first cut off
his hair and beard; let him put on yellow robes, adjust his upper robe
so as to cover one shoulder, salute the feet of the Bhikkhus (with his
head), and sit down squatting; then let him raise his joined hands, and
tell him to say: "I take my refuge in the Buddha, I take my refuge in
the Dhamma, I take my refuge in the Sa*m*gha. And for the second time,
&c. And for the third time take I my refuge in the Buddha, and for the
third time take I my refuge in the Dhamma, and for the third time take I
my refuge in the Sa*m*gha."

   <span id="38:3"></span>3. 'Let that person, O Bhikkhus, who has
formerly belonged to a Titthiya school, approach the Sa*m*gha, adjust
his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, salute the feet of the
Bhikkhus (with his head), sit down squatting, raise his joined hands,
and say: "I, N. N., reverend Sirs,who have formerly belonged to a
Titthiya school, desire to receive the upasampadâ ordination in this
doctrine and discipline, and ask the Sa*m*gha, reverend Sirs, for a
parivâsa of four months." Let him ask thus a second time. Let him ask
thus a third time.

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

   'Then let a learned, competent Bhikkhu proclaim the following *ñ*atti
before the Sa*m*gha: "Let the Sa*m*gha, reverend Sirs, hear me, This
person N, N ., who has formerly belonged to a Titthiya school, desires
to receive the upasampadâ ordination in this doctrine and discipline, He
asks the Sa*m*gha for a parivâsa of four months. If the Sa*m*gha is
ready, let the Sa*m*gha impose on N. N., who has formerly belonged to a
Titthiya school, a parivâs-a of four months, This is the *ñ*atti,

   <span id="38:4"></span>4. '"Let the Sa*m*gha, reverend Sirs, hear me,
This person N. N., who has, &c. He asks the Sa*m*gha for a parivâsa of
four months, The Sa*m*gha imposes on N. N., who has formerly belonged to
a Titthiya school, a parivâsa of four months. Let any one of the
venerable brethren who is in favour of imposing a parivâsa of four
months on N. N., who has formerly belonged to a Titthiya school, be
silent, and any one who is not in favour of it, speak, A parivâsa of
four months has been imposed by the Sa*m*gha on N. N., who has formerly
belonged to a Titthiya school, The Sa*m*gha is in favour of it,
therefore it is silent. Thus I understand."

   <span id="38:5"></span>5. 'And this, O Bhikkhus, is the way in which
a person that has formerly belonged to a Titthiya school, succeeds or
fails in satisfying (the Bhikkhus and obtaining upasampadâ when the
probation-time is over),

   'What is the way, a Bhikkhus, in which a person that has formerly
belonged to a Titthiya school, fails in satisfying (the Bhikkhus)?

   'In case, O.Bhikkhus, the person that has formerly belonged to a
Titthiya school, enters the village <span id="page_189">p. 189</span>
too early, and comes back (to the Vihâra) too late, thus, O Bhikkhus, a
person that has formerly belonged to a Titthiya school, fails in
satisfying (the Bhikkhus).

   'And further, O Bhikkhus, in case the person that has formerly
belonged to a Titthiya school, frequents the society of harlots, or of
widows, or of adult girls, or of eunuchs, or of Bhikkhunîs, thus also, O
Bhikkhus, a person that has formerly belonged to a Titthiya school,
fails in satisfying (the Bhikkhus).

   <span id="38:6"></span>6. 'And further, O Bhikkhus, in case the
person that has formerly belonged to a Titthiya school, does not show
himself skilled in the various things his fellow Bhikkhus have to do,
not diligent, not able to consider how those things are to be done, not
able to do things himself, not able to give directions to others, thus
also, O Bhikkhus, &c.

   'And further, O Bhikkhus, in case the person that has formerly
belonged to a Titthiya school, does not show keen zeal, when the
doctrine is preached to him or when questions are put, in what belongs
to morality, to contemplation, and to wisdom, thus also, O Bhikkhus, &c.

   <span id="38:7"></span>7. 'And further, O Bhikkhus, in case the
person that has formerIy belonged to a Titthiya school, becomes angry,
displeased, and dissatisfied, when people speak against the teacher, the
belief, the opinions, the persuasion, the creed of the school he
formerly belonged to; and is pleased, glad, and satisfied, when people
speak against the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sa*m*gha; or he is
pleased, glad, and satisfied, when people speak in praise of the
teacher, &c.; and becomes angry, displeased, dissatisfied, when people
speak in praise of the Buddha, the <span id="page_190">p. 190</span>
Dhamma, and the Sa*m*gha; this, O Bhikkhus, is a decisive moment for the
failure of a person that has formerly belonged to a Titthiya school (in
obtaining admission to the Sa*m*gha).

   'Thus, O Bhikkhus, a person that has formerly belonged to a Titthiya
school, fails in satisfying (the Bhikkhus). When a person comes, O
Bhikkhus, that has formerly belonged to a Titthiya school, and has thus
failed in satisfying (the Bhikkhus), the upasampadâ ordination should
not be conferred on him.

   <span id="38:8"></span>8-10. 'And what is the way, O Bhikkhus, in
which a person that has formerly belonged to a Titthiya school, succeeds
in satisfying (the Bhikkhus)?

   'In case, O Bhikkhus, the person that has formerly belonged to a
Titthiya school, does not enter the village too early (&c., point by
point the contrary of the preceding).

   'When a person comes, O Bhikkhus, that has formerly belonged to a
Titthiya school, and has thus succeeded in satisfying (the Bhikkhus),
the upasampadâ ordination ought to be conferred on him.

   <span id="38:11"></span>11. 'If a person, O Bhikkhus, that has
formerly beIonged to a Titthiya school, comes (to the Bhikkhus) naked,
it is incumbent on his upa*ggh*âya to get a robe for him. If he comes
with unshaven hair, the Sa*m*gha's permission ought to be asked for
having his hair shaved<span id="page_190_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_190_note_1.md).

   'If fire-worshippers and *G*a*t*ilas come to you, O Bhikkhus, they
are to receive the upasampadâ ordination (directly), and no parivâsa is
to be imposed on them. And for what reason? These, O Bhikkhus, hold the
doctrine that actions receive their <span id="page_191">p. 191</span>
reward, and that our deeds have their result (according to their moral
merit).

   'If a Sakya by birth, O Bhikkhus, who has belonged to a Titthiya
school, comes to you, he is to receive the upasampadâ ordination
(directly), and no parivâsa is to be imposed on him. This exceptional
privilege, O Bhikkhus, I grant to my kinsmen.'

### <span id="39"></span>39.

   <span id="39:1"></span>1. At that time these five diseases prevailed
among the people of Magadha:--leprosy, boils, dry leprosy, consumption,
and fits. The people who were affected with these five diseases went to
*G*îvaka Komârabha*kk*a<span id="page_191_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_191_note_1.md) and said: 'pray, doctor,
cure us.'

   'I have too many duties', Sirs, and am too occupied. I have to treat
the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra, and the royal seraglio, and the
fraternity of Bhikkhus with the Buddha at their head. I cannot cure you.

   'All that we possess shall be yours, doctor, and we will be your
slaves; pray, doctor, cure us.'

   'I have too many duties, Sirs, &c.; I cannot cure you.'

   <span id="39:2"></span>2. Now those people thought: 'Indeed the
precepts which these Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as keep and <span
id="page_192">p. 192</span> the life they live are commodious; they have
good meals and lie down on beds protected from the wind. What if we were
to embrace the religious life among the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as: then the
Bhikkhus will nurse us, and *G*îvaka Komârabha*kk*a, will cure us.'

   Thus these persons went to the Bhikkhus and asked them for the
pabba*gg*â ordination; the Bhikkhus conferred on them the pabba*gg*â and
upasampadâ ordinations; and the Bhikkhus nursed them, and *G*îvaka
Komârabha*kk*a cured them.

   <span id="39:3"></span>3. At that time the Bhikkhus, who had to nurse
many sick Bhikkhus, began to solicit (lay people) with many demands and
many requests: 'Give us food for the sick; give us food for the tenders
of the sick; give us medicine for the sick.' And also *G*îvaka
Komârabha*kk*a, who had to treat many sick Bhikkhus, neglected some of
his duties to the king.

   <span id="39:4"></span>4. Now one day a man who was affected with the
five diseases went to *G*îvaka Komârabha*kk*a and said:'Pray, doctor,
cure me.'

   'I have too many duties, Sir, and am too occupied; I have to treat
the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra, and the royal seraglio, and the
fraternity of Bhikkhus with the Buddha at their head; I cannot cure
you.'

   'All that I possess shall be yours, doctor, and I will be your slave;
pray doctor, cure me.'

   'I have too many duties, Sir, &c.; I cannot cure you.

   <span id="39:5"></span>5. Now that man thought: 'Indeed the precepts
which these Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as keep (&c., down to:): then the
Bhikkhus will nurse me, and *G*îvaka Komârabha*kk*a will cure me. When I
have become free from sickness, then I will return to the world.'

   Thus that man went to the Bhikkhus and asked them for the pabba*gg*â
ordination; the Bhikkhus <span id="page_193">p. 193</span> conferred on
him the pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ ordinations; and the Bhikkhus nursed
him, and *G*îvaka Komârabha*kk*a cured him. When he had become free from
sickness, he returned to the world. Now *G*îvaka Komârabha*kk*a saw this
person that had returned to the world; and when he saw him he asked that
person: 'Had you not embraced the religious life, Sir, among the
Bhikkhus?'

   'Yes, doctor.'

   'And why have you adopted such a course, Sir?'

   Then that man told *G*îvaka Komârabha*kk*a the whole matter .

   <span id="39:6"></span>6. Then *G*îvaka Komârabha*kk*a was annoyed,
murmured, and became angry: 'How can the venerable brethren confer the
pabba*gg*â ordination on a person affected with the five diseases?'

   And *G*îvaka Komârabha*kk*a went to the place where the Blessed One
was; having approached him and having respectfully saluted the Blessed
One, he sat down near him. Sitting near him, *G*îvaka Komârabha*kk*a
said to the Blessed One: 'Pray, Lord, let their reverences not confer
the pabba*gg*â ordination on persons affected with the five diseases.'

   <span id="39:7"></span>7. Then the Blessed One taught, incited,
animated, and gladdened *G*îvaka Komârabha*kk*a by religious discourse;
and *G*îvaka Komârabha*kk*a, having been taught . . . . and gladdened by
the Blessed One by religious discourse, rose from his seat, respectfully
saluted the Blessed One, and passing round him with his right side
towards him, went away.

   In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One, after
having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus:
'Let no one, <span id="page_194">p. 194</span> O Bhikkhus, who is
affected with the five diseases, receive the pabba*gg*â ordination. He
who confers the pabba*gg*â ordination ( on such a person), is guilty of
a dukka*t*a offence.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="40"></span>40.

   <span id="40:1"></span>1. At that time the border provinces (of the
kingdom) of the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra were agitated. Then the
Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra gave order to the officers who were at the
head of the army: 'Well now, go and search through the border
provinces<span id="page_194_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_194_note_1.md): The officers who were
at the head of the army accepted the order of the Magadha king Seniya
Bimbisâra (by saying), 'Yes, Your Majesty.'

   <span id="40:2"></span>2. Now many distinguished warriors thought:
'We who go (to war) and find our delight in fighting, do evil and
produce great demerit. Now what shall we do that we may desist from
evil-doing and may do good?'

   Then these warriors thought: 'These Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as lead
indeed a virtuous, tranquil, holy life; they speak the truth; they keep
the precepts of morality, and are endowed with all virtues. If we could
obtain pabba*gg*â with the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as, we should desist from
evil-doing and do good.'

   Thus these warriors went to the Bhikkhus and <span id="page_195">p.
195</span> asked them for the pabba*gg*â ordination; the Bhikkhus
conferred on them: the pabba*gg*â and upasanipadâ ordinations.

   <span id="40:3"></span>3. The officers at the head of the army asked
the royal soldiers: 'Why, how is it that the warriors N. N. and N. N.
are nowhere to be seen?'

   'The warriors N. N. and N. N., Lords, have embraced religious life
among the Bhikkhus.'

   Then the officers at the head of the army were annoyed, murmured, and
became angry: 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as ordain persons in the
royal service?'

   The officers who were at the head of the army told the thing to the
Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra. And the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra
asked the officers of justice: 'Tell me, my good Sirs, what punishment
does he deserve who ordains a person in the royal service?'

   'The upa*ggh*âya, Your Majesty, should be beheaded; to him who
recites (the kammavâ*k*â), the tongue should be torn out; to those who
form the chapter, half of their ribs should be broken.'

   <span id="40:4"></span>4. Then the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra went
to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and having
respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him. Sitting near
him the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra said to the Blessed One: 'Lord,
there are unbelieving kings who are disinclined (to the faith); these
might harass the Bhikkhus even on trifling occasions. Pray, Lord, let
their reverences not confer the pabba*gg*â ordination on persons in
royal service.'

   Then the Blessed One taught (&c., see chap. 39. 7, <span
id="page_196">p. 196</span> down to:), thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'Let
no one, O Bhikkhus, who is in the royal service, receive the pabba*gg*â
ordination. He who confers the pabba*gg*â ordination (on such a person),
is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence:

### <span id="41"></span>41.

   At that time the robber A<u>n</u>gulimâla<span
id="page_196_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_196_note_1.md) had embraced religious
life among the Bhikkhus. When the people saw that, they became alarmed
and terrified; they fled away, went elsewhere, turned away their heads,
and shut their doors. The people were annoyed, murmured, and became
angry: 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as ordain a robber who openly
wears the emblems (of his deeds)?'

   Some Bhikkhus heard those people that were annoyed, murmured, and had
become angry; these Bhikkhus told the thing to the Blessed One.

   The Blessed One thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'Let no robber, O
Bhikkhus, who wears the emblems (of his deeds), receive the pabba*gg*â
ordination. He who confers the pabba*gg*â ordination (on such a person),
is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence.'

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

### <span id="42"></span>42.

   <span id="42:1"></span>1. At that time the Magadha king Seniya
Bimbisâra had issued the following decree: 'No one is to do any harm to
those who are ordained among the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as; well taught is
their doctrine; let them lead a holy life for the sake of the complete
extinction of suffering.'

   Now at that time a certain person who had committed robbery was
imprisoned in the jail. He broke out of the jail, ran away, and received
the pabba*gg*â ordination with the Bhikkhus.

   <span id="42:2"></span>2. The people who saw him, said: 'Here is the
robber who has broken out of jail; come, let us bring him (before the
authorities).'

   But some people replied: 'Do not say so, Sirs. A decree has been
issued by the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra: 'No one is to do any harm
to those who are ordained, &c.'

   People were annoyed, murmured, and became angry, thinking: 'Indeed
these Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as are secure from anything; it is not allowed
to do any harm to them. How can they ordain a robber who has broken out
of jail?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no robber, O Bhikkhus, who has broken out of jail, receive the
pabba*gg*â ordination. He who confers the pabba*gg*â ordination (on such
a person), is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence.'

### <span id="43"></span>43.

   At that time a certain person who had committed robbery had run away
and had become ordained with the Bhikkhus. At the royal palace a
proclamation was written: 'Wherever he is seen, he is to be killed.'

   The people who saw him, said: 'Here is the proclaimed robber; come,
let us kill him' (&c., as in chap. 42).

   'Let no proclaimed robber, O Bhikkhus, receive the pabba*gg*â
ordination. He who confers the pabba*gg*â ordination (on such a robber),
is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="44"></span>44.

   At that time a certain person who had been punished by scourging had
been ordained with the Bhikkhus. People were annoyed, &c.: 'How can
these Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as ordain a person that has been punished by
scourging?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, who has been punished by scourging, receive
the pabba*gg*â ordination. He who confers the pabba*gg*â ordination (on
such a person), is guilty of dukka*t*a offence.'

   At that time a certain person who had been punished by branding (&c.,

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

### <span id="46"></span>46.

   At that time a certain person who was in debt, ran away and was
ordained with the Bhikkhus. When his creditors saw him, they said:
'There is our debtor; come, let us lead him (to prison).' But some
people replied: 'Do not say so, Sirs. A decree has been issued by the
Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra: 'No one is to do any harm to those who
are ordained with the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as; well taught is their
doctrine; let them lead a holy life for the sake of the complete
extinction of suffering.'

   People were annoyed, murmured, and became angry: 'Indeed these
Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as are secure from anything; it is not allowed to do
anything to them. How can they ordain a debtor?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no debtor, O Bhikkhus, receive the pabba*gg*â ordination. He who
confers the pabba*gg*â ordination (on a debtor), is guilty of a
dukka*t*a offence.'

### <span id="47"></span>47.

   At that time a slave ran away and was ordained with the Bhikkhus.
When his masters saw him, they said: 'There is our slave; come, let us
lead him away (back to our house),' (&c., as in chap. 46).

   'Let no slave, O Bhikkhus, receive the pabba*gg*â ordination. He who
confers the pabba*gg*â ordination (on a slave), is guilty of a dukka*t*a

   <span id="48:1"></span>1. At that time a certain smith<span
id="page_200_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span

having had a quarrel with his father and mother, had gone to the Ârâma
and received pabba*gg*â with the Bhikkhus. Now the father and mother of
that bald-headed smith, searching after that bald-headed smith, came to
the Ârâma and asked the Bhikkhus: 'Pray, reverend Sirs, have you seen
such and such a boy?'

   The Bhikkhus, who did not know him, said: 'We do not know him;'
having not seen him, they said: 'We have not seen him.'

   <span id="48:2"></span>2. Now the father and mother of that
bald-headed smith, searching after that bald-headed smith, found him
ordained with the Bhikkhus; they were annoyed, &c.: 'These Sakyaputtiya
Sama*n*as are shameless, wicked, and liars. They knew him and said: "We
do not know him;" they had seen him and said: "We have not seen him."
This boy has been ordained with the Bhikkhus.'

   Now some Bhikkhus heard the father and mother of that bald-headed
smith, who were annoyed, &c. Those Bhikkhus told the thing to the
Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that the Sa*m*gha's permission is asked for
having (the new coming Bhikkhus) shaved.'

### <span id="49"></span>49.

   <span id="49:1"></span>1. At that time there was in Râ*g*agaha a
company of seventeen boys, friends of each other; young Upâli<span
id="page_201_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_201_note_1.md) was first among them.
Now Upâli's father and mother thought: 'How will Upâli after our death
live a life of ease and without pain?' Then Upâli's father and mother
said to themselves: 'If Upâli could learn writing, he would after our
death live a life of ease and without pain.' But then Upâli's father and
mother thought again: 'If Upâli learns writing, his fingers will become
sore. But if Upâli could learn arithmetic, he would after our death live
a life of ease and without pain.'

   <span id="49:2"></span>2. But then Upâli's father and mother thought
again: 'If Upâli learns arithmetic, his breast will become diseased<span
id="page_201_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_201_note_2.md). But if Upâli could
learn money-changing<span id="page_201_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_201_note_3.md), he would after our
death live a life of ease and comfort, and without pain.' But then
Upâli's father and mother said to themselves: 'If Upâli learns
money-changing, his eyes will suffer. Now here are the Sakyaputtiya
Sama*n*as, who keep commodious precepts and live a commodious life; they
have good meals and lie down on beds protected from the wind. If Upâli
could be ordained with the <span id="page_202">p. 202</span>
Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as, he would after our death live a life of ease and
without pain.'

   <span id="49:3"></span>3. Now young Upâli heard his father and mother
talking thus. Then young Upâli went to the other boys; having approached
them, he said to those boys: 'Come, Sirs, let us get ordained with the
Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as.' (They replied): 'If you will get ordained, Sir,
we will be ordained also.' Then those boys went each to his father and
mother and said to them: 'Give me your consent for leaving the world and
going forth into the houseless state.' Then the parents of those boys,
who thought, 'It is a good thing what all these boys are wishing so
unanimously for, gave their consent. They went to the Bhikkhus and asked
them for the pabba*gg*â ordination. The Bhikkhus conferred the
pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ ordinations on them.

   <span id="49:4"></span>4. In the night, at dawn, they rose and began
to cry: 'Give us rice-milk, give us soft food, give us hard food!' The
Bhikkhus said: 'Wait, friends, till day-time. If there is rice-milk, you
shall drink; if there is food, soft or hard, you shall eat; if there is
no rice-milk and no food, soft or hard, you must go out for alms, and
then you will eat.'

   But those Bhikkhus, when they were thus spoken to by the other
Bhikkhus, threw their bedding about and made it wet, calling out: 'Give
us rice-milk, give us soft food, give us hard food!'

   <span id="49:5"></span>5. Then the Blessed One, having arisen in the
night, at dawn, heard the noise which those boys made; hearing it he
said to the venerable Ânanda: 'Now, Ânanda, what noise of boys is that?'

   Then the venerable Ânanda told the thing to the Blessed One.

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

   'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, that the Bhikkhus knowingly confer the
upasampadâ ordination on persons under twenty years of age?'

   'It is true, Lord.'

   Then the Blessed One rebuked those Bhikkhus: 'How can those foolish
persons, O Bhikkhus, knowingly confer the upasampadâ ordination on
persons under twenty years of age?

   <span id="49:6"></span>6. 'A person under twenty years, O Bhikkhus,
cannot endure coldness and heat, hunger and thirst, vexation by gadflies
and gnats, by storms and sun-heat, and by reptiles; (he cannot endure)
abusive, offensive language; he is not able to bear bodily pains which
are severe, sharp, grievous, disagreeable, unpleasant, and destructive
to life; whilst a person that has twenty years of age, O Bhikkhus, can
endure coldness, &c. This will not do, O Bhikkhus, for converting the
unconverted and for augmenting the number of the converted.'

   Having rebuked those Bhikkhus and delivered a religious discourse, he
thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, knowingly confer
the upasampadâ ordination on a person under twenty years of age. He who
does, is to be treated according to the law<span

   At that time a certain family had died of pestilence<span
id="page_204_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_204_note_1.md); only a father and his
son were left; they received the pabba*gg*â ordination with the Bhikkhus
and went together on their rounds for alms. Now that boy, when food was
given to his father, ran up to him and said: 'Give some to me too,
father; give some to me too, father.'

   People were annoyed, &c.: 'These Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as live an
impure life; this boy is a Bhikkhunî's son.'

   Some Bhikkhus heard, &c.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One, &c. 'Let no one, O Bhikkhus,
confer the pabba*gg*â ordination on a boy under fifteen years of age. He
who does, is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="51"></span>51.

   At that time a believing, pious family, who devoted themselves to the
(especial) service of the venerable Ânanda, had died of pestilence. Only
two boys were left; these, when seeing Bhikkhus, ran up to them
according to their old custom, but the Bhikkhus turned them away. When
they were turned away by the Bhikkhus, they cried. Now the venerable
Ânanda thought: 'The Blessed One has forbidden us to confer the
pabba*gg*â ordination <span id="page_205">p. 205</span> on a boy under
fifteen years of age, and these boys are under fifteen years of age.
What can be done in order that these boys may not perish?' And the
venerable Ânanda told this thing to the. Blessed One.

   'Are these boys able, Ânanda, to scare crows?'

   'They are, Lord.'

   In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One, after
having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'I
allow you, O Bhikkhus, to confer the pabba*gg*â ordination on
crow-keeper boys even under fifteen years of age.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="52"></span>52.

   At that time the venerable Upananda, of the Sakya tribe, had two
novices, Ka*nd*aka and Mahaka; these committed sodomy with each other.
The Bhikkhus were annoyed, &c.: 'How can novices abandon themselves to
such bad conduct?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One, &c.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, ordain two novices. He who does, is guilty
of a dukka*t*a offence<span id="page_205_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_205_note_1.md).'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="53"></span>53.

   <span id="53:1"></span>1. At that time the Blessed One dwelt at
Râ*g*agaha during the rainy season, and remained at the same place
during winter and summer. The people were annoyed, &c.: 'The (four)
regions are<span id="page_205_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_205_note_2.md) . . . . and <span
id="page_206">p. 206</span> covered by darkness to the Sakyaputtiya
Sama*n*as; they cannot discern the (four) regions.' Some Bhikkhus heard,
&c.

   <span id="53:2"></span>2. Then the Blessed One said to the venerable
Ânanda: 'Go, Ânanda, take a key and tell the Bhikkhus in every cell:
"Friends, the Blessed One wishes to go forth to Dakkhi*n*âgiri. Let any
one of the venerable brethren who thinks fit, come to him."'

   The venerable Ânanda accepted this order of the Blessed One (by
saying), 'Yes, Lord,' took a key, and said to the Bhikkhus in every
cell: 'Friends, the Blessed One,' &c.

   <span id="53:3"></span>3. The Bhikkhus replied: 'Friend Ânanda, the
Blessed One has prescribed<span id="page_206_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_206_note_1.md) that Bhikkhus are to
live (the first) ten years in dependence (on their â*k*ariyas and
upa*ggh*âyas), and that he who has completed his tenth year, may give a
nissaya himself. Now if we go there, we shall be obliged to take a
nissaya there; then we shall stay there for a short time, then we must
go back again and take a new nissaya. If our â*k*ariyas and upa*ggh*âyas
go, we will go also; if our â*k*ariyas and upa*ggh*âyas do not go, we
will not go either. Otherwise our light-mindedness, friend Ânanda, will
become manifest.'

   <span id="53:4"></span>4. Thus the Blessed One went forth to
Dakkhi*n*âgiri fonowed only by a few Bhikkhus. And the Blessed One,
after having dwelt at Dakkhi*n*âgiri as long as he thought fit, went
back to Râ*g*agaha again.

   Then the Blessed One said to the venerable Ânanda: 'How is it,
Ânanda, that the perfect <span id="page_207">p. 207</span> One has gone
forth to Dakkhi*n*âgiri with so few Bhikkhus?'

   Then the venerable Ânanda told the thing to the Blessed One.

   In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One, after
having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'I
prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that a learned, competent Bhikkhu lives five
years in dependence (on his â*k*ariya and upa*ggh*âya), an unlearned one
all his life.

   <span id="53:5"></span>5. 'In five cases, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu
should not live without a nissaya (i.e. independent of â*k*ariya and
upa*ggh*âya): when he does not possess full perfection in what belongs
to moral practices (&c., as in chap. 36. 2). In these five cases, O
Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu should not live without a nlssaya.

   'In five cases, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu may live without a nissaya:
when he possesses full perfection in what belongs to moral practices

### <span id="54"></span>54.

   <span id="54:1"></span>1. Then the Blessed One, after having resided
at Râ*g*agaha as long as he thought fit, went forth to <span
id="page_208">p. 208</span> Kapilavatthu. Wandering from place to place
he came to Kapilavatthu. There the Blessed One dwelt in the Sakka
country, near Kapilavatthu, in the Nigrodhârâma (Banyan Grove).

   And in the forenoon the Blessed One, having put on his under-robes,
took his alms-bowl and with his *k*îvara on went to the residence of the
Sakka Suddhodana (his father). Having gone there, he sat down on a seat
laid out for him.

   Then the princess, who was the mother of Râhula<span
id="page_208_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_208_note_1.md), said to young Râhula:
'This is your father, Râhula; go and ask him for your inheritance.'

   <span id="54:2"></span>2. Then young Râhula went to the place where
the Blessed One was; having approached him, he stationed himself before
the Blessed One (and said): 'Your shadow, Sama*n*a, is a place of
bliss.'

   Then the Blessed One rose from his seat and went away, and young
Râhula followed the Blessed One from behind and said: 'Give me my
inheritance, Sama*n*a; give me my inheritance, Sama*n*a.'

   Then the Blessed One said to the venerable Sâriputta: 'Well,
Sâriputta, confer the pabba*gg*â. ordination on young Râhula.'
(Sâriputta replied): 'How shall I confer, Lord, the pabba*gg*â
ordination on young Râhula?'

   <span id="54:3"></span>3. In consequence of that and on this occasion
the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus
addressed the Bhikkhus: 'I prescribe, <span id="page_209">p. 209</span>
O Bhikkhus, the pabba*gg*â ordination of novices by the threefold
declaration of taking refuge.

   'And you ought, O Bhikkhus, to confer the pabba*gg*â ordination (on a
novice) in this way: Let him first have his hair and beard cut off; let
him put on yellow robes, adjust his upper robe so as to cover one
shoulder, salute the feet of the Bhikkhus (with his head), and sit down
squatting; then let him raise his joined hands and tell him to say: "I
take my refuge in the Buddha, I take my refuge in the Dhamma, I take my
refuge in the Sa*m*gha. And for the second time, &c. And for the third
time, &c."

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, the pabba*gg*â ordination of novices by
this threefold declaration of taking refuge.'

   Thus the venerable Sâriputta conferred the pabba*gg*â ordination on
young Râhula.

   <span id="54:4"></span>4. Then the Sakka Suddhodana went to the place
where the Blessed One was; having approached him and having respectfully
saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him. Sitting near him the
Sakka Suddhodana said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, I ask one boon of the
Blessed One.' (The Buddha replied): 'The perfect Ones, Gotama, are above
granting boons (before they know what they are<span
id="page_209_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_209_note_1)).' (Suddhodana said.md):
'Lord, it is a proper and unobjectionable demand.' 'Speak, Gotama.'

   <span id="54:5"></span>5. 'Lord, when the Blessed One gave up the
<span id="page_210">p. 210</span> world, it was a great pain to me; so
it was when Nanda<span id="page_210_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_210_note_1.md) did the same; my pain
was excessive when Râhula too did so. The love for a son, Lord, cuts
into the skin; having cut into the skin, it cuts into the hide; having
cut into the hide, it cuts into the flesh, . . . . the ligaments, . . .
. the bones; having cut into the bones, it reaches the marrow and dwells
in the marrow. Pray, Lord, let their reverences not confer the
pabba*gg*â ordination on a son without his father's and mother's
permission.'

   Then the Blessed One taught the Sakka Suddhodana (&c., see chap. 39.
7).

   'Let no son, O Bhikkhus, receive the pabba*gg*â ordination without
his father's and mother's permission. He who confers the pabba*gg*â
ordination (on a son without that permission), is guilty of a dukka*t*a
offence.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="55"></span>55.

   Then the Blessed One, after having resided at Kapilavatthu as long as
he thought fit, went forth to Sâvatthi. Wandering from place to place he
came to Sâvatthi. There the Blessed One dwelt at Sâvatthi, in the
*G*etavana, the Ârâma of Anâthapi*nd*ika.

   At that time a family who devoted themselves to the (especial)
service of the venerable Sâriputta sent a boy to the venerable Sâriputta
(with this message): <span id="page_211">p. 211</span> 'Might the Thera
confer the pabba*gg*â ordination on this boy.' Now the venerable
Sâriputta thought: 'The Blessed One has established the rule<span
id="page_211_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_211_note_1.md) that no one may ordain
two novices, and I have already one novice, Râhula. Now what am I to
do?' He told the thing to the Blessed One.

   'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a learned, competent Bhikkhu to ordain two
novices, or to ordain as many novices as he is able to administer
exhortation and instruction to.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="56"></span>56.

   Now the novices thought: 'How many precepts<span
id="page_211_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_211_note_2.md) are there for us, and in
what (precepts) are we to exercise ourselves?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, ten precepts for the novices, and the
exercise of the novices in these (ten precepts), viz. abstinence from
destroying life; abstinence from stealing; abstinence from impurity;
abstinence from lying; abstinence from arrack and strong drink and
intoxicating liquors, which cause indifference (to religion); abstinence
from eating at forbidden times; abstinence from dancing, singing, music,
and seeing spectacles; abstinence from garlands, scents, unguents,
ornaments, and finery; abstinence from (the use of) high or broad beds;
abstinence from accepting gold or silver. I prescribe, <span
id="page_212">p. 212</span> O Bhikkhus, these ten precepts for the
novices, and the exercise of the novices in these (ten precepts).'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="57"></span>57.

   <span id="57:1"></span>1. At that time novices did not show reverence
and confidence towards the Bhikkhus, and did not live in harmony with
them. The Bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry: 'How can
the novices not show reverence and confidence towards the Bhikkhus, and
not live in harmony with them?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you inflict punishment upon a novice
in five cases: When he is intent on the Bhikkhus' receiving no alms;
when he is intent on the Bhikkhus' meeting with misfortune; when he is
intent on the Bhikkhus' finding no residence; when he abuses and reviles
the Bhikkhus; when he causes divisions between Bhikkhus and Bhikkhus. I
prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that in these five cases you inflict punishment
upon a novice.'

   <span id="57:2"></span>2. Now the Bhikkhus thought: 'What punishment
are we to inflict?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you forbid them (certain places, for
instance, their own residences).'

   At that time Bhikkhus forbad novices the whole Sa*m*ghârâma. The
novices, who were not admitted to the Sa*m*ghârâma, went away, or
retumed to the world, or went over to Titthiya schools.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

   'Let them not, O Bhikkhus, forbid (novices) the whole Sa*m*ghârâma.
He who does so, commits a dukka*t*a offence. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus,
that (the Bhikkhus) forbid (a novice) the place where he lives or which
he uses to frequent.'

   <span id="57:3"></span>3. At that time Bhikkhus forbad the novices
the use of (certain kinds of) food that is taken with the mouth. People,
when they prepared rice-milk to drink or meals for the Sa*m*gha, said to
the novices:

   'Come, reverend Sirs, drink rice-milk; come, reverend Sirs, take
food.' The novices replied: 'It is impossible, friends; the Bhikkhus
have issued a forewarning (against us).' The people were annoyed,
murmured, and became angry, thinking: 'How can their reverences forbid
novices the use of all food that is taken with the mouth?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let them not, O Bhikkhus, forbid (novices) food that is taken with
the mouth. He who does so, commits a dukka*t*a offence.'

   At that time the *Kh*abbaggiya<span
id="page_213_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_213_note_1.md) Bhikkhus laid a ban upon
novices without the consent of the upa*ggh*âyas (of those novices). The
upa*ggh*âyas <span id="page_214">p. 214</span> searched after them,
thinking: 'How is it that our novices have disappeared?' The Bhikkhus
said: 'The*Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus, friends, have laid a ban upon them.'
The upa*ggh*âyas were annoyed, &c.: 'How can the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus
lay a ban upon our novices without having obtained our consent?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkh us, lay a ban (upon novices) without consent of
the upa*ggh*âyas. He who does, commits a dukka*t*a offence.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="59"></span>59.

   At that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus drew the novices of senior
Bhikkhus over (to themselves). The Theras, who were obliged to get
themselves teeth-cleansers and water to rinse their mouths with, became
tired.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, draw the followers of another Bhikkhu over
to himself. He who does, commits a dukka*t*a offence.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="60"></span>60.

   At that time a novice, Ka*nd*aka by name, who was a follower of the
venerable Upananda Sakyaputto, had sexual intercourse with a Bhikkhunî,
Ka*nd*akâ by name. The Bhikkhus were annoyed, &c.: 'How can a novice
abandon himself to such conduct?'

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you expel a novice (from the
fraternity) in the following ten cases: When he destroys life; when he
commits theft; when he commits impurity; when he is a liar; when he
drinks strong drinks; when he speaks against the Buddha; when he speaks
against the Dhamma; when he speaks against the Sa*m*gha; when he holds
false doctrines; when he has sexual intercourse with Bhikkhunîs<span

   <span id="62:1"></span>1. At that time there was a certain person of
an old family, whose kinsmen had died away; he was delicately nurtured.
Now this person of an old family, whose kinsmen had died away, thought:
'I am delicately nurtured; I am not able to acquire new riches or to
augment the riches which I possess. What shall I do in order that I may
live a life of ease and without pain?'

   Then this person of an old family, whose kinsmen had died away, gave
himself the following answer: 'There are the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as, who
keep commodious precepts and live a commodious life; they have good
meals and lie down on beds protected from wind. What if I were to
procure myself an alms-bowl and robes on my own account, and were to
have my hair and beard cut off, to put on yellow robes, to go to the
Ârâma, and to live there with the Bhikkhus.'

   <span id="62:2"></span>2. Then that person of an old family, whose
kinsmen had died away, procured himself an alms-bowl and robes on his
own account, had his hair and beard cut off, put on yellow robes, went
to the Ârâma, and respectfully saluted the Bhikkhus. The <span
id="page_217">p. 217</span> Bhikkhus said to him: 'How many years,
friend, have elapsed since your upasampadâ?'

   'What does that mean, friends, "years elapsed since the upasampadâ?"'

   'And who is your upa*ggh*âya, friend?'

   'What does that word upa*ggh*âya mean, friends?'

   The Bhikkhus said to the venerable Upâli: 'Pray, friend Upâli,
examine this ascetic.'

   <span id="62:3"></span>3. Then that person of an old family, whose
kinsmen had died away, when being examined by the venerable Upâli, told
him the whole matter. The venerable Upâli told this thing to the
Bhikkhus; the Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let a person, O Bhikkhus, who has furtively attached himself to the
Sa*m*gha, if he has not received the upasampadâ ordination, not receive
it; if he has received it, let him be expelled (from the fraternity).

### <span id="63"></span>63.

   <span id="63:1"></span>1. At that time there was a serpent who was
aggrieved at, ashamed of, and conceived aversion for his having been
born as a serpent. Now this serpent thought: 'What am I to do in order
to become released from being a serpent, and quickly to obtain human
nature?' Then this serpent gave himself the following answer: 'These
Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as lead indeed a virtuous, tranquil, holy life; they
speak the truth; they keep the precepts of morality, and are endowed
with all virtues. If <span id="page_218">p. 218</span> I could obtain
pabba*gg*â with the Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as, I should be released from
bcing a serpent and quickly obtain human nature,'

   <span id="63:2"></span>2. Then that serpent, in the shape of a youth,
went to the Bhikkhus, and asked them for the pabba*gg*â ordination; the
Bhikkhus conferred on him the pabba*gg*â and upasampadâ ordinations.

   At that time that serpent dwelt together with a certain Bhikkhu in
the last Vihâra (near the boundary wall of the *G*etavana). Now that
Bhikkhu, having arisen in the night, at dawn, was walking up and down in
the open air. When that Bhikkhu had left (the Vihâra), that serpent, who
thought himself safe (from discovery), fell asleep (in his natural
shape). The whole Vihâra was filled with the snake's body; his windings
jutted out of the window.

   <span id="63:3"></span>3. Then that Bhikkhu thought: 'I will go back
to the Vihâra,' opened the door, and saw the whole Vihâra filled with
the snake's body, the windings jutting out of the window. Seeing that he
was terrified and cried out. The Bhikkhus ran up, and said to that
Bhikkhu: 'Why did you cry out, friend?' 'This whole Vihâra, friends, is
filled with a snake's body; the windings jut out of the window.'

   Then that serpent awoke from that noise and sat down on his seat. The
Bhikkhus said to him: 'Who are you, friend?' 'I am a serpent, reverend
Sirs.' 'And why have you done such a thing, friend?' Then that Nâga told
the whole matter to the Bhikkhus; the Bhikkhus told it to the Blessed
One.

   <span id="63:4"></span>4. In consequence of that and on this occasion
the Blessed One, having ordered the fraternity of <span id="page_219">p.
219</span> Bhikkhus to assemble, said to that serpent: 'You serpents are
not capable of (spiritual) growth in this doctrine and discipline.
However, serpent, go and observe fast on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and
eighth day of each half month; thus will you be released from being a
serpent and quickly obtain human nature.'

   Then that serpent, who thought, 'I am not capable of (spiritual)
growth in this doctrine and discipline,' became sad and sorrowful, shed
tears, made an outcry, and went away.

   <span id="63:5"></span>5. Then the Blessed One said to the Bhikkhus:

   'There are two occasions, O Bhikkhus, on which a serpent (who has
assumed human shape) manifests his true nature: when he has sexual
intercourse with a female of his species, and if he thinks himself safe
(from discovery) and falls asleep. These, O Bhikkhus, are the two
occasions on which a serpent manifests his true nature.

   'Let an animal, O Bhikkhus, that has not received the upasampadâ
ordination, not receive it; if it has received it, let it be expelled
(from the fraternity).'

### <span id="64"></span>64.

   <span id="64:1"></span>1. At that time a certain young man deprived
his mother of life. He was grieved, ashamed, and loathed this sinful
deed. Now this young man thought: 'What am I to do to get rid of my
sinful deed?' Then this young man gave himself this answer: 'These
Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as lead indeed a virtuous, tranquil, holy life, &c.
If I could obtain <span id="page_220">p. 220</span> pabba*gg*â with the
Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as, I might get rid of my sinful deed.'

   <span id="64:2"></span>2. Then that young man went to the Bhikkhus
and asked them for the pabba*gg*â ordination. The Bhikkhus said to the
venerable Upâli: 'Formerly , friend Upâli, a serpent in the shape of a
youth received the pabba*gg*â ordination with the Bhikkhus; pray, friend

the venerable Upâli, told him the whole matter. The venerable Upâli told
it to the Bhikkhus; the Bhikkhus told it to the Blessed One.

robbers who were being led to death; seeing them they said: 'It is well
that we have escaped; had we been caught, we should also be killed
thus.' The Bhikkhus said to them: 'Why, what have you done, friends?'
Then those (robbers) who had been ordained, told the whole matter to the
Bhikkhus. The Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Those Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, were Arahats. Let a person, O Bhikkhus,

saying, 'Like the Titthiyas.'

gave a nissaya to shameless Bhikkhus.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, give a nissaya to shameless Bhikkhus. He who
does, is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence.'

   At that time some Bhikkhus lived in dependence on shameless Bhikkhus
(i.e. they received a nissaya from them, they chose them for their
upa*ggh*âyas or â*k*ariyas); ere long they became also shameless, bad
Bhikkhus.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, live in dependence on shameless Bhikkhus. He
who does, is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence.'

   <span id="72:2"></span>2. Now the Bhikkhus thought: 'The Blessed One
has prescribed that we shall not give a nissaya to shameless Bhikkhus,
nor live in dependence on shameless Bhikkhus. Now how are we to discern
modest and shameless persons?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you wait first four or five days until
you have seen how a Bhikkhu behaves to the other Bhikkhus.'

'The Blessed One has prescribed that we shall not live without a nissaya
(of an â*k*ariya and <span id="page_227">p. 227</span> an upa*ggh*âya);
now I want a nissaya, but I am travelling. What am I to do?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a travelling Bhikkhu who can get no nissaya, to
live without a nissaya.'

on the road in the Kosala country. They came to a certain residence;
there one of the two Bhikkhus was taken ill. Now that sick Bhikkhu
thought: 'The Blessed One has prescribed that we shall not live without
a nissaya; now I want a nissaya, but I am sick. What am I to do?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a sick Bhikkhu who can get no nissaya, to live
without a nissaya.'

Bhikkhu, thought: 'The Blessed One has prescribed, &c.; now I want a
nissaya, but this Bhikkhu is sick. What am I to do?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu who is nursing a sick Bhikkhu, if he
can get no nissaya and the sick asks him (to remain with him), to live
without a nissaya.'

forest; he had a dwelling-place where he lived pleasantly. Now this

pleasantly. What am I to do?'

   'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu living in the forest who finds a
place where he may live pleasantly, <span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

himself): "If a proper person to give me nissaya comes hither, I will

desired to receive the upasampadâ ordination from the venerable
Mahâkassapa. Then the venerable Mahâkassapa sent a messenger to the
venerable Ânanda: 'Come, Ânanda, and recite the upasampadâ proclamation
for this person.' The venerable Ânanda said: 'I cannot pronounce the
Thera's (i.e. Mahâkassapa's) name; the Thera is too venerable compared
with me.'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to use also the family name (of the
upa*ggh*âya, instead of his proper name) in the proclamation.'

   <span id="74:2"></span>2. At that time there were two persons that
desired to receive the upasampadâ ordination from the venerable
Mahâkassapa. They quarrelled with each other. (One said): 'I will
receive the upasampadâ ordination first. ' (The other said): 'Nay, I
will receive it first.' . They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to ordain two persons by one proclamation.'

   <span id="74:3"></span>3. At that time there were persons who desired
to receive the upasampadâ ordination from different Theras. They
quarrelled with each other. (One said); , 1 will receive the upasampadâ
ordination <span id="page_229">p. 229</span> first.' (The other said):
'Nay, I will receive it first.' The Theras said: 'Well, friends, let us
ordain them altogether by one proclamation.'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to ordain two or three persons by one
proclamation, provided they have the same upa*ggh*âya, but not if they
have different upa*ggh*âyas.'

### <span id="75"></span>75.

   At that time the venerable Kumârakassapa had received the upasampadâ
ordination when he had completed the twentieth year from his conception
(but not from his birth). Now the venerable Kumârakassapa thought: 'The
Blessed One has forbidden us to confer the upasampadâ ordination on
persons under twenty years of age<span

twentieth year (only) from my conception. Have I, therefore, received
the upasampadâ ordination, or have I not received it?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'When, O Bhikkhus, in the womb the first thought rises up (in the
nascent being), the first consciousness manifests itself, according to
this the (true) birth should be reckoned. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to

who were afflicted with leprosy, boils, dry leprosy, consumption, and
fits.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that he who confers the upasampadâ
ordination, ask (the person to be ordained) about the Disqualifications
(for receiving the ordination). And let him ask, O Bhikkhus, in this
way:

   'Are you afflicted with the following diseases, leprosy, boils, dry
leprosy, consumption, and fits?

   'Are you a man?

   'Are you a male?

   'Are you a freeman?

   'Have you no debts?

   'What is your name?

   'What is your upa*ggh*âya's name?'

   <span id="76:2"></span>2. At that time the Bhikkhus asked the persons
who desired to receive the upasampadâ ordination about the
Disqualifications, without having them instructed beforehand (how to
answer). The persons that desired to be ordained, became disconcerted,
perplexed, and could not answer.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you first instruct (the persons
desirous of being ordained), and then ask them about the
Disqualifications.'

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

   <span id="76:3"></span>3. Then they instructed (the candidates) in
the midst of the assembly; the persons desirous of being ordained became
disconcerted, perplexed, and could not answer nevertheless.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you instruct them aside, and ask them
about the Disqualifications before the assembly. And you ought, O
Bhikkhus, to instruct them in this way: You ought first to cause them to
choose an upa*ggh*âya; when they have chosen an upa*ggh*âya, their
alms-bowl and robes must be shown to them, "This is your alms-bowl, this
is your sa*m*ghâ*t*i, this is your upper robe, this is your under
garment; come and place yourself here."'

   <span id="76:4"></span>4. Ignorant, unlearned Bhikkhus instructed
them; the persons desirous of being ordained, though they had been
instructed, became disconcerted, perplexed, and could not answer.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no ignorant, unlearned Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, instruct them. If
they do, they commit a dukka*t*a offence. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that
a learned, competent Bhikkhu instruct them.'

were not appointed thereto.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, instruct them without being appointed
thereto. He who so instructs, commits a dukka*t*a offence. I prescribe,
O Bhikkhus, that an appointed Bhikkhu is to instruct them. And (this
Bhikkhu), O Bhikkhus, is to be appointed in this way: One may either
appoint himself, or one may appoint another person. And how is (a
Bhikkhu) to <span id="page_232">p. 232</span> appoint himself? Let a
learned, competent Bhikkhu proclaim the following *ñ*atti before the

which is. When I ask you before the assembly about that which is, you
ought, if it is so, to answer: 'It is;' if it is not so, you ought to
answer: 'It is not.' Be not disconcerted, be not perplexed. I shall ask
you thus: 'Are you afflicted with the following diseases, &c?'"'

conferred the upasampadâ ordination on a certain Bhikkhu, left him alone
and went away. Afterwards, as he went alone (to the Ârâma), he met on
the way his former wife. She said to him: 'Have you now embraced the
religious life?' (He replied): 'Yes, I have embraced the religious
life.' 'It is difficult to persons who have embraced religious life, to
obtain sexual intercourse; come, let us have intercourse.' He practised
intercourse with her, and, in consequence, came late (to the Arâma). The
Bhikkhus said: 'How is it, friend, that you are so late?'

   <span id="78:2"></span>2. Then that Bhikkhu told the whole matter to
the Bhikkhus. The Bhikkhus told it to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you give a companion to a

   '"A Bhikkhu who has received the upasampadâ ordination ought to
abstain from all sexual intercourse even with an animal. A Bhikkhu who
practises sexual intercourse is no Sama*n*a and no follower of the

his trunk alone, thus a Bhikkhu who practises sexual intercourse is no

long as your life lasts.

from theft, even of a blade of grass. A Bhikkhu who takes what is not
given to him, or steals it, if it is a pâda (i.e. a quarter of a
kârshâpa*n*a), or of the value of a pâda or worth more than a pâda, is
no Sama*n*a and no follower of the Sakyaputta. As a sear leaf loosed

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_73">p. 73</span>

<span id="page_73_note_1"></span>[1](#page_73_fr_1.md) To this book is
prefixed, as introduction, an account of the first events after Gotama's
attaining Buddhahood, down to the conversion of his two chief disciples,
Sâriputta and Moggallâna (chaps. 1-24). Among the elements of historical
or legendary character with which, in the Vinaya Pi*t*aka, the
discussion of the monastic discipline is interwoven, this account
occupies by far the first place, both in extent and in importance. For
it contains the oldest version accessible to us now and, most probably,
for ever, of what the Buddhist fraternity deemed to be the history of
their Master's life in its most important period.

The connection in which this legendary narration stands with the main
subject of the first Khandhaka is not difficult to account for. The
regulations regarding the admission to the fraternity, which are
discussed in this Khandhaka, could not but present themselves to the
redactors of the Pi*t*aka as being the very basis of their religious
discipline and monastic life. It was possible to fancy the existence of
the Sa*m*gha without the Pâtimokkha rules, or without the regulations
about the Pavâra*n*â festival, but it was impossible to realise the idea
of a Sa*m*gha without rules showing who was to be regarded as a duly
admitted member of the fraternity, and who was not. It is quite natural,
therefore, that the stories or legends concerning the ordination of
Bhikkhus were put in connection with the record of the very first events
of the history of the Sa*m*gha. Nor is it difficult to account for the
theory formulated by the historians of the Buddhist ecclesiastical law,
of different successive forms in which the ordination of Bhikkhus had
been performed. In the beginning, of course, there was nobody but the
Buddha himself who could ordain Bhikkhus; to him those who desired to be
received, expressed their wish, and he conferred on them the pabba*gg*â
and upasampadâ ordinations by the formula: 'Ehi bhikkhu,' &c. (see I, 6,
32, 34, &c.) It was a very natural conception that afterwards, as the
Sa*m*gha grew larger, the Buddha should have transferred the power of
admitting new members to the Bhikkhus themselves, and should have
instituted that form of ordination which the redactors of the Pi*t*aka
found valid at their own time.

The transition, however, from the supposed oldest form of ordination
(the so-called ehi-bhikkhu-upasampadâ) to that latter form is in the
Vinaya legends not represented as immediate. There is described an
intermediate stage between the two, the ordination by the three
sara*n*agamanas, or by the candidate's three times repeated declaration
of his taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sa*m*gha (see
Mahâvagga I, 12). The reason which has led the redactors of the Vinaya
Pi*t*aka to this construction, was most probably the important part
which in the upasampadâ service of the later time devolved upon the
preceptor (upa*ggh*âya) of the candidate. As only learned Bhikkhus, who
had completed the tenth year after their own upasampadâ, could perform
the function of upa*ggh*âya at the upasampadâ ordination of other
Bhikkhus (Mahâvagga I, 31, 8), it was natural that the redactors of the
Vinaya found it impossible to ascribe this form of upasampadâ service to
the first times of Buddha's teaching. For these times, therefore, they
recorded another form, the upasampadâ by the three sara*n*agamanas, the
introduction of which they assigned, very naturally, to the time soon
after the conversion of Yasa's friends, by which event the number of
Bhikkhus had been augmented at once from seven to sixty-one.

<span id="page_74_note_2"></span>[2](#page_74_fr_2.md) After having reached
the sambodhi and before preaching to the world the truth he has
acquired, the Buddha remains, according to the tradition, during some
weeks at Uruvelâ, 'enjoying the bliss of emancipation.' The Mahâvagga,
which contains these legends in their oldest forms, assigns to this stay
a period of four times seven days; the later tradition is unanimous in
extending it to seven times seven days (Buddhaghosa in the commentary on
the Mahâvagga; *G*âtaka Atthav. vol. i. p. 77 seq.; Dîpava*m*sa I, 29,
30; Lalita Vistara, p. 488 seq.; Beal, Romantic Legend, p. 236 seq.,

<span id="page_75_note_1"></span>[1](#page_75_fr_1.md) The Chain of
Causation, or the doctrine of the twelve nidânas (causes of existence),
contains, as has often been observed, in a more developed form an answer
to the same problem to which the second and third of the four Noble
Truths (ariyasa*kk*a) also try to give a solution, viz. the problem of
the origin and destruction of suffering. The Noble Truths simply reduce
the origin of suffering to Thirst, or Desire (Ta*n*hâ), in its threefold
form, thirst for pleasure, thirst for existence, thirst for prosperity
(see I, 6, 20). In the system of the twelve nidânas Thirst also has
found its place among the causes of suffering, but it is not considered
as the immediate cause. A concatenation of other categories is inserted
between to*n*hâ and its ultimate effect; and on the other hand, the
investigation of causes is carried on further beyond to*n*hâ. The
question is here asked, What does to*n*hâ come from? and thus the series
of causes and effects is led back to aviggâ (Ignorance), as its deepest
root. We may add that the redactors of the Pi*t*akas, who of course
could not but observe this parallelity between the second and third
ariyasa*kk*as and the system of the twelve nidânas, go so far, in one
instance (A<u>n</u>guttara-Nikâya, Tika-Nipâta, fol. *k*e of the Phayre
MS.), as to directly replace, in giving the text of the four
ariyasa*kk*as, the second and third of them by the twelve nidânas, in
direct and reverse order respectively. Professor Childers has furnished
a valuable note on the nidânas; see Colebrooke, Miscellaneous Essays
(second edition), II, 453 seq.

<span id="page_75_note_2"></span>[2](#page_75_fr_2.md) In the
Sammâdi*tth*isuttanta (Ma*ggh*ima-Nikâya, fol. khû of Turnour's MS.) we
find the following explanation of what Ignorance is: 'Not to know
Suffering, not to know the Cause of suffering, not to know the Cessation
of suffering, not to know the Path which leads to the cessation of
suffering, this is called Ignorance.' The same is repeated in the
explanation of the nidâna formula, which is given in the Vibha<u>n</u>ga
(Abhidhamma-Pi*t*aka, Pa*t*i*kk*asamuppâda-vibha<u>n</u>ga, fol. *k*i of
the Phayre MS.), and we must accept it, therefore, as the authentic
expression of Buddhistical belief. It is obvious, however, that this
explanation leaves room for another question. Ignorance, we are told, is
the source of all evil and of all suffering, and the subject ignored is
stated to be the four Truths. But who is the subject that ignores them?
All attributes (as the vi*ññ*â*n*a, &c.), that constitute sentient
beings and enable them to know or to ignore, are said to be first
produced by Ignorance, and we shou1d conclude, therefore, that they
cannot exist before Ignorance has begun to act. Or are we to understand
that it is the Ignorance incurred by a sentient being in a preceding
existence, that causes the sa*m*khâras and Consciousness, the connecting
links between the different existences, to act and to bring about the
birth of a new being?

As is well known, this Ignorance (Avidyâ) plays a great part also in the
Brahmanical philosophy of the Upanishads; and the Buddhist belief is, no
doubt, founded to a considerable extent on older theories. But we cannot
venture in a note to touch upon one of the most difficult and
interesting questions which await the research of Indianists.

<span id="footnotes_page_76">p. 76</span>

<span id="page_76_note_1"></span>[1](#page_76_fr_1.md) It is very
frequently stated that there are three sa*m*khâras or productions:
kâyasa*m*khâra, va*k*isa*m*khâra, and *k*ittasa*m*khâra, or, productions
of body, of speech, and of thought (see, for instance, the
Sammâdi*tth*isuttanta, Ma*ggh*ima-Nikâya, fol. khû of Turnour's MS.) The
kâyasa*m*khâra consists, according to the Sa*m*khâra-Yamaka
(Abhidhamma-Pi*t*aka), in inhalation and expiration (assâsapassâsâ); the
va*k*îsa*m*khâra in attention and investigation (vitakkavi*k*ârâ); the
*k*ittasa*m*khâra in ideas, sensations, and all attributes of mind
except attention and investigation (sa*ññ*â *k*a vedanâ *k*a *th*apetvâ
vitakkavi*k*âre sabbe pi *k*ittasampayuttakâ dhammâ). The
Vibha<u>n</u>ga (Abhidhamma-Pi*t*aka,
Pa*t*i*kk*asamuppâdavibha<u>n</u>ga, I.I.{sic. ?}) gives, when
discussing the sa*m*khâras, six categories instead of the three: 'Now
which are the sa*m*khâras that are produced by Ignorance? Sa*m*khâras
(or, productions) that lead to righteousness, sa*m*khâras that lead to
sinfulness, sa*m*khâras that lead to immovability, productions of body,
of speech, and of thought.' The Pâli words are: 'Tattha katame
avi*gg*âpa*kk*ayâ sa*m*khârâ? pu*ññ*âbhisa*m*khâro apu*ññ*âbhisa*m*khâro
â*n*a*ñg*âbhisa*m*khâro kâyasa*m*khâro va*k*isa*m*khâro
*k*ittasa*m*khâro.' The list of fifty-five categories belonging to the
sa*m*khâra-khandha, which Sp. Hardy gives in his Manual (p. 404 seq.;
comp. also Rh. D., 'Buddhism,' p. 91 seq., and 'Buddhist Suttas from the
Pâli,' [p. 242](../sbe11/sbe1108.htm#page_242).md), is not founded, as far
as we know, on the authority of the Pi*t*akas themselves, but on later
compendia and commentaries.

<span id="page_81_note_1"></span>[1](#page_81_fr_1.md) Buddhaghosa says

where the two merchants met Buddha, is thus described in the Mahâvastu:

<span id="footnotes_page_82">p. 82</span>

<span id="page_82_note_1"></span>[1](#page_82_fr_1.md) The term Tathâgata
is, in the Buddhistical literature, exclusively applied to
Sammâsambuddhas, and it is more especially used in the Pi*t*akas when
the Buddha is represented as speaking of himself in the third person as
'the Tathâgata.' The meaning 'sentient being,' which is given to the
word in the Abhidhânappadîpikâ, and in Childers's Dictionary, is not
confirmed, as far as we know, by any passage of the Pi*t*akas. This
translation of the word is very possibly based merely on a
misunderstanding of the phrase often repeated in the Sutta Pi*t*aka:
hoti tathâgato para*m* mara*n*â, which means, of course, 'does a Buddha
exist after death?' In the *G*aina books we sometimes find the term
tatthagaya (tatragata), 'he who has attained that world, i.e.
emancipation,' applied to the *G*inas as opposed to other beings who are
called ihagaya (idhagata), 'living in this world.' See, for instance,
the *G*ina*k*aritra, § 16. Considering the close relation in which most
of the dogmatical terms of the *G*ainas stand to those of the Bauddhas,
it is difficult to believe that tathâgata and tatthagaya should not
originally have conveyed very similar ideas. We think that on the long
way from the original Mâgadhî to the Pâli and Sanskrit, the term
tatthagata or tatthâgata (tatra + âgata), 'he who has arrived there,
i.e. at emancipation,' may very easily have undergone the change into
tathâgata, which would have made it unintelligible, were we not able to
compare its unaltered form as preserved by the *G*ainas.

<span id="page_83_note_2"></span>[2](#page_83_fr_2.md) Onîtapattapâ*n*i,
which is said very frequently of a person who has finished his meal, is
translated by Childers, 'whose hand is removed from the bowl' (comp.
also Trenckner, Pali Miscellany, p. 66). We do not think this
explanation right, though it agrees with, or probably is based on, a
note of Buddhaghosa ('pattato *k*a apanîtapâ*n*i*m*'). Onîta, i.e.
avanita, is not apanîta, and the end of the dinner was marked, not by
the Bhikkhu's removing his hand from the bowl, but by his washing the
bowl (see *K*ullavagga VIII, 4, 6), and, of course, his hands. In
Sanskrit the meaning of ava-nî is, to pour (water) upon something; see
the Petershurg Dictionary. We have translated, therefore,
onîtapattapâ*n*i accordingly.

upadhis, therefore, according to this passage, consist: firstly, in the
actions of mind that are directed towards the khandhas (i.e. that have
the effect of propagating and augmenting the dominion of the khandhas);
secondly, in the actions tending to the fivefold pleasures of sense; and
thirdly, in those connected with kilesa (evil passion).

is not to be found in any one of these five classes, which are all
subject to origin and decay. This discourse of the Buddha's, which is
frequently called the Anattalakkha*n*a Sutta (Sutta of the not having
the signs of self), shows the perishable nature of the five khandhas,
and that the khandhas are not the self. But it does not deal with the
question, whether the self exists or not, in any other way.

position of honour among the merchants. In the later literature we hear
of an office of se*tth*i (se*tth*i-*tth*âna) in a city, to which any one
with the requisite wealth and talent was eligible (*G*âtaka I, 120-122);
and, according to the Mahâva*m*sa, the king appointed to an office
called se*tth*itâ, apparently at his court (Mah. p. 69). The Gahapati,
or Treasurer, one of the seven jewels of a king, is explained by
Buddhaghosa to be se*tth*i-gahapati (see Rh. D.'s note on Mahâ-sudassana
Sutta I, 41). 'The Se*tth*i,' standing alone, or 'the Mahâ-se*tth*i,'
means Anâtha Pi*nd*ika (*G*âtaka I, 95, 227-230; Dhammapada Commentary,
p. 395). Below, in chapter 9, § 1, it would seem that the rank of
se*tth*i was hereditary, and this is confirmed by the later literature;
but this applies to the social rank only, and not to the office.

dishes to the guest until the latter says, 'I have had enough.' Childers
accordingly translates sampavâreti, 'to cause to refuse.' But as

should have exactly the opposite meaning. We prefer, therefore, to take
it as an emphatic synonym of pavâreti.

<span id="page_178_note_2"></span>[2](#page_178_fr_2.md) Â*k*ariya as well
as upa*ggh*âya means 'teacher,' or 'preceptor.' It is very difficult or
rather impossible to draw a sharp line of distinction between â*k*ariyâ
and upa*ggh*âya. The duties of an â*k*ariya towards his antevâsika, and
of an antevâsika towards his â*k*ariya, as indicated in chaps. 32, 33 (
= *K*ullavagga VIII, 13, 14), are exactly the same as those of an
upa*ggh*âya towards his saddhivihârika and vice versa (chaps. 25, 26 =
*K*ullavagga VIII, 11, 12). The position of an upa*ggh*âya, however, was
considered as the more important of the two; at the upasampadâ service
the upa*ggh*âya had a more prominent part than the â*k*ariya, as we may
infer from chaps. 28, 29, and from the explanations on the 65th
pâ*k*ittiya rule which are given in the Sutta Vibha<u>n</u>ga. There it
is said that, if the upasampadâ ordination had been conferred, against
the rule, on a person that has not yet attained his twentieth year, the
upa*ggh*âya has made himself guilty of a pâ*k*ittiya offence, the
â*k*ariya and the other present Bhikkhus only of a dukka*t*a offence. We
may add that the succession of Vinaya teachers from Upâli down to
Mahinda, which is given in the Dîpava*m*sa (Bhâ*n*avâras IV and V), is a
succession of upa*ggh*âyas and saddhivihârikas (see IV, 36, 42, 43,
&c.), not of â*k*ariyas and antevâsikas; the duty of instructing the
young Bhikkhus in the holy doctrines and ordinances seems, therefore, to
belong to the upa*ggh*âya rather than to the â*k*ariya; compare also
Dîpava*m*sa VII, 26. So among the Brâhma*n*as, on the contrary, the
â*k*ârya is estimated higher than the upâdhyâya; see Manu II, 145;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 35. Compare also chap. 36. 1 (end of the paragraph),
and Buddhaghosa's explanation of that passage.

<span id="page_179_note_1"></span>[1](#page_179_fr_1.md) Nissaya (i.e.
dependence) is the relation between â*k*ariya and antevâsika. The
antevâsika lives ' nissâya ' with regard to the â*k*ariya, i.e.
dependent on him; the â*k*ariya gives his nissaya to the antevâsika.
i.e. he receives him into his protection and care. At chap. 36. 1,
'nissaya ' is said also of the relation between upa*ggh*âya and

his upa*ggh*âya paying homage to a sacred shrine in the same Vihâra, or
going on his rounds in the same village, cessation of the nissaya
(towards the â*k*ariya) is the consequence. If he hears the voice of his
upa*ggh*âya, who preaches the Dhamma or gladdens (lay-people by
religious discourse), in the Vihâra or in the interior of a house, and
if he recognises that it is his upa*ggh*âya's voice, cessation of the

the minor rules of the Pâtimokkha. Buddhaghosa's explanation is
