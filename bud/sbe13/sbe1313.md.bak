## SECOND KHANDHAKA.

(THE UPOSATHA CEREMONY, AND THE PÂTIMOKKHA.)

### <span id="1"></span>1.

   <span id="1:1"></span>1. At that time the blessed Buddha dwelt near
Râ*g*agaha, on the Gi*ggh*akû*t*a mountain ('the Vulture's Peak'). At
that time the Paribbâ*g*akas belonging to Titthiya schools assembled on
the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of each half month<span
id="page_239_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_239_note_1.md) and recited their
Dhamma. The people went to them in order to hear the Dhamma. They were
filled with favour towards, and were filled with faith in, the
Paribbâ*g*akas belonging to Titthiya schools; the Paribbâ*g*akas
belonging to Titthiya schools gained adherents.

   <span id="1:2"></span>2. Now when the Mâgadha king Seniya Bimbisâra
was alone, and had retired into solitude, the following consideration
presented itself to his mind: 'The Paribbâ*g*akas belonging to Titthiya
schools assemble now on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of
each half month and recite their Dhamma. The people go to them in order
to hear the Dhamma. They are filled with favour towards, and are filled
with faith in, the Paribbâ*g*akas who belong to Titthiya <span
id="page_240">p. 240</span> schools; the Paribbâ*g*akas who belong to
Titthiya schools gain adherents. What if the reverend ones (the Buddhist
Bhikkhus) were to assemble also on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth
clay of each half month.'

   <span id="1:3"></span>3. Then the Mâgadha king Seniya Bimbisâra went
to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and having
respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat clown near him. Sitting
near him the Mâgadha king Seniya Bimbisâra said to the Blessed One:
'Lord, when I was alone and had retired into solitude, the following
consideration presented itself to my mind: "The Paribbâ*g*akas, &c.;
what if the reverend ones were to assemble also on the fourteenth,
fifteenth, and eighth clay of each half month." Well, Lord, let the
reverend ones assemble also on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth
clay of each half month.'

   <span id="1:4"></span>4. Then the Blessed One taught, incited,
animated, and gladdened the Mâgadha king Seniya Bimbisâra by religious
discourse; and the Mâgadha king Seniya Bimbisâra, having been taught and
gladdened by the Blessed One by religious discourse, rose from his seat,
respectfully saluted the Blessed One, passed round him with his right
side towards him, and went away.

   In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One, after
having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'I
prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you assemble on the fourteenth, fifteenth,
and eighth clay of each month.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

### <span id="2"></span>2.

   At that time the Bhikkhus, considering that the Blessed One had
ordered them to assemble on the fourteenth &c. day of each half month,
assembled on the fourteenth &c. day of each half month and sat there
silent. The people went to them in order to hear the Dhamma. They were
annoyed, murmured, and became angry: 'How can the Sakyaputtiya
Sama*n*as, when they have assembled on the fourteenth &c. day of each
half month, sit there silent, like the dumb, or like hogs? Ought they
not to recite the Dhamma, when they have assembled?' Some Bhikkhus heard
those people that were annoyed, murmured, and had become angry; these
Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One. In consequence of that and
on this occasion the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious
discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that
you recite the Dhamma, when you have assembled on the fourteenth &c. day
of each half month.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="3"></span>3.

   <span id="3:1"></span>1. Now when the Blessed One was alone and had
retired into solitude, the following consideration presented itself to
his mind: 'What if I were to prescribe that the Bhikkhus recite as the
Pâtimokkha<span id="page_241_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_241_note_1.md) the precepts which I
have promulgated to <span id="page_242">p. 242</span> them; this will be
their Uposatha service (service of the fast-day).'

   <span id="3:2"></span>2. And the Blessed One, having left the
solitude in the evening, in consequence of that and on this occasion,
after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the
Bhikkhus: 'When I was alone, O Bhikkhus, and had retired into solitude,
the following consideration, &c., this will be their Uposatha service. I
prescribe you, O Bhikkhus, to recite the Pâtimokkha.

   <span id="3:3"></span>3. 'And you ought, O Bhikkhus, to recite it in
this way: Let a learned, competent Bhikkhu proclaim the foilowing
*ñ*atti before the Sa*m*gha: "Let the Sa*m*gha, reverend Sirs, hear me.
To-day it is Uposatha, the fifteenth (of the half month). If the
Sa*m*gha is ready, let the Sa*m*gha hold the Uposatha service and recite
the Pâtimokkha. What ought to be first done by the Sa*m*gha? Proclaim
the pârisuddhi<span id="page_242_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_242_note_1.md), Sirs. I will recite the
Pâtimokkha."

   '"We hear it well and fix well the mind on it all of us<span
id="page_242_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_242_note_2.md)."

   '"He who has committed an offence, may confess it; if there is no
offence, you should remain silent; from your being silent I shall
understand that the reverend brethen are pure (from offences). As a
single person that has been asked a question, answers it, the same is
the matter if before an <span id="page_243">p. 243</span> assembly like
this a question has been solemnly proclaimed three times: if a Bhikkhu,
after a threefold proclamation, does not confess an existing offence
which he remembers, he commits an intentional falsehood. Now, reverend
brethren, an intentional falsehood has been declared an impediment<span
id="page_243_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_243_note_1.md) by the Blessed One.
Therefore, by a Bhikkhu who has committed (an offence), and remembers
it, and desires to become pure, an existing offence should be confessed;
for if it has been confessed, it is treated duly."'

   <span id="3:4"></span>4.<span id="page_243_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_243_note_2.md) 'Pâtimokkha*m*:' it is
the beginning, it is the face (mukha*m*), it is the principal
(pamukha*m*) of good qualities; therefore it is called 'pâtimokkham<span
id="page_243_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_243_note_3.md).'

   'Sâdhuka*m* su*n*oma' (we hear it well): admitting <span

repeat the whole of it in our thoughts.

   'Manasikaroma' (we fix our minds on it): we listen to it with

   <span id="3:5"></span>5. 'Yassa siyâ âpatti' (he who has committed an
offence): he who, whether an aged or young or middle-aged Bhikkhu, has
committed some offence belonging to the five classes of ofiences or to

   'So âvikareyya:' he may show it, unveil it, make it evident, declare
it before the Sa*m*gha (the full chapter of Bhikkhus), or before a small
number, or before one person.

   'Asanti âpatti' (a non-existing offence): an offence which has not

   'Tu*n*hi bhavitabba*m*' (he ought to remain silent): he ought to

   <span id="3:6"></span>6. 'Yathâ kho pana pa*kk*ekapu*tth*assa

question answers it): as a single person that has been asked a question

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="4"></span>4.

   <span id="4:1"></span>1. At that time the Bhikkhus, considering that
the Pâtimokkha recitation had been instituted by the Blessed One,
recited the Pâtimokkha every day.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'The Pâtimokkha, O Bhikkhus, is not to be recited every day. He who
recites it (every day), commits a dukka*t*a offence. I ordain, O
Bhikkhus, to recite the Pâtimokkha on the Uposatha day.'

   <span id="4:2"></span>2. At that time the Bhikkhus, considering that
it had been prescribed by the Blessed One to recite the Pâtimokkha on
the Uposatha day, recited the Pâtimokkha three times each half month, on
the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of each half month.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

   'The Pâtimokkha, O Bhikkhus, is not to be recited three times each
half month. He who recites it (tnree times), commits a dukka*t*a
offence. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you recite the Pâtimokkha once
each half month, on the fourteenth or on the fifteenth day.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="5"></span>5.

   <span id="5:1"></span>1. At that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus
recited the Pâtimokkha according as they lived together, every one
before his own companions.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'The Pâtimokkha, O Bhikkhus, is not to be recited according as (the
Bhikkhus) live together, by every one before his own companions. He who
recites it (in that way), commits a dukka*t*a offence. I prescribe, O
Bhikkhus, that the Uposatha service is to be held by the complete
fraternity.'

   <span id="5:2"></span>2. Now the Bhikkhus thought: 'The Blessed One
has prescribed that the Uposatha service is to be held by the complete
fraternity. How far does completeness extend, as far as one residence
(or one district), or all over the earth?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that completeness is to extend as far as
one residence.'

   <span id="5:3"></span>3. At that time the reverend Mahâ Kappina dwelt
near Râ*g*agaha, in the deer park of Maddaku*kkh*i. Now (one day) when
the reverend Mahâ Kappina was alone and had retired into solitude, the
following consideration presented itself to his mind: 'Shall I go to the
Uposatha service or shall I not go? Shall I go to the functions of the
Order <span id="page_248">p. 248</span> or shall I not go? Indeed I have
become pure by the highest purity (i.e. I have reached Arahatship or
Nirvâ*n*a).'

   <span id="5:4"></span>4. Then the Blessed One, understanding by the
power of his mind the reflection which had arisen in Mahâ Kappina's
mind, disappeared from the Gi*ggh*akû*t*a mountain and appeared in the
deer park of Maddaku*kkh*i, before the reverend Mahâ Kappina (as
quickly) as a strong man might stretch his bent arm out, or draw his
outstretched arm back. The Blessed One sat down on a seat laid out for
him, and the reverend Mahâ Kappina, after having respectfully saluted
the Blessed One, sat down also near him.

   <span id="5:5"></span>5. When the reverend Mahâ Kappina was seated
near him, the Blessed One said to him: 'When you were alone, Kappina,
and had retired into solitude, has not the following consideration
presented itself to your mind: "Shall I go (&c., as in § 3 down to:) by
the highest purity?"'

   'Even so, Lord.'

   'If you Brâhmanas do not honour, do not regard, do nat revere, do not
pay reverence to the Uposatha, who will then honour, regard, revere, pay
reverence to the Uposatha? Go to the Uposatha, O Brâhmana, do not
neglect to go; go to the functions of the Order, do not neglect to go.'
The reverend Mahâ Kappina promised the Blessed One to do so (by saying),
'Even so, Lord.'

   <span id="5:6"></span>6. Then, having taught, incited, animated, and
gladdened the reverend Mahâ Kappina by a religious discourse, the
Blessed One disappeared from the deer park of Maddaku*kkh*i, from the
presence of the reverend Mahâ Kappina, and appeared on the <span
id="page_249">p. 249</span> Gi*ggh*akû*t*a mountain (as quickly) as a
strong man might stretch his bent arm out, or draw his outstretched arm
back.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="6"></span>6.

   Now the Bhikkhus thought: 'The Blessed One has prescribed that
completeness (of the assembled fraternity) is to extend as far as one
residence<span id="page_249_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_249_note_1.md). Now how far does one
residence extend?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus; that you determine a boundary. And it ought
to be determined, O Bhikkus, in this way: First the landmarks are to be
proclaimed: a landmark consisting in a mountain, in a rock, in a wood,
in a tree, in a path, in an anthill, in a river, in a piece of water.
The landmarks having been proclaimed, let a learned, competent Bhikkhu
proclaim the following *ñ*atti before the Sa*m*gha: "Let the Sa*m*gha,
reverend Sirs, hear me. If the Sa*m*gha is ready, let the Sa*m*gha, as
the landmarks have been proclaimed all around, by these land marks
determine the boundary for common residence and communion of Uposatha.
This is the *ñ*atti. Let the Sa*m*gha, reverend Sirs, hear me. The
Sa*m*gha determines the boundary (&c., as above). Thus I understand."'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="7"></span>7.

   <span id="7:1"></span>1. At that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus,
considering that fixing of boundaries had been <span id="page_250">p.
250</span> prescribed by the Blessed One, fixed boundaries of excessive
extension, of four yo*g*anas, five yo*g*anas, six yo*g*anas. The
Bhikkhus who came to the Uposatha, arrived when the Pâtimokkha was being
recited, or when it had just been recited, or they were obliged to stay
the night on the way.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, determine a boundary of excessive extension,
of four, five, or six yo*g*anas. He who determines (such a boundary),
commits a dukka*t*a offence. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you determine
boundaries of three yo*g*anas' extent at most.

   <span id="7:2"></span>2. At that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus
determined a boundary which extended to the opposite side of a river.
The Bhikkhus who came to the Uposatha, were carried down (by the river),
and their alms-bowls and robes were carried away.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, determine a boundary which extends to the
opposite side of a river. He who determines (such a boundary), commits a
dukka*t*a offence. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, if there is a regular
communication by a ferry boat or a dike, at such places to determine a
boundary which extends also to the opposite side of the river.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="8"></span>8.

   <span id="8:1"></span>1. At that time the Bhikkhus recited the
Pâtimokkha in their successive cells without appointing (a certain place
for doing so). The Bhikkhus who <span id="page_251">p. 251</span>
arrived (from distant places), did not know where the Uposatha was to be
held that day.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, recite the Pâtimokkha in the successive
cells without appointing a certain place for it. He who recites it (in
this way), commits a dukka*t*a offence. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, the
holding of Uposatha after having fix:ed upon an Uposatha hall, wherever
the Sa*m*gha likes, a Vihâra, or an A*ddh*ayoga, or a storied building,
or a house, or a cave<span id="page_251_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_251_note_1.md). And you ought to
appoint it in this way:

   <span id="8:2"></span>2. 'Let a learned, competent Bhikkhu proclaim
the following *ñ*atti before the Sa*m*gha: "Let the Sa*m*gha, reverend
Sirs, hear me. If the Sa*m*gha is ready, let the Sa*m*gha appoint the
Vihâra called N. N. to be our Uposatha hall. This is the *ñ*atti Let the
Sa*m*gha, reverend Sirs, hear me. The Sa*m*gha appoints, &c. Thus I
understand." ,

   <span id="8:3"></span>3. At that time there were in a certain
residence (or district) two Uposatha halls fixed upon. The Bhikkhus
assembled in both places, because (some of them) thought, 'The Uposatha
will be held here;' (and some), 'It will be held there.'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, fix upon two Uposatha halls in one district.
He who does so, commits a dukka*t*a offence. I ordain, O Bhikkhus, the
abolishing of one of them<span id="page_251_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_251_note_2.md), and the holding of
Uposatha ( only) in one place.

   <span id="8:4"></span>4. 'And you ought to abolish it, O Bhikkhus, in
this way: Let a learned, competent Bhikkhu proclaim <span
id="page_252">p. 252</span> the following *ñ*atti before the Sa*m*gha:
"Let the Sa*m*gha, reverend Sirs, hear me. If the Sa*m*gha is ready, the
Sa*m*gha may abolish the Uposatha hall called N.N. This is the *ñ*atti.
Let the Sa*m*gha, &c. Thus I understand."'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="9"></span>9.

   <span id="9:1"></span>1. At that time in a certain district too small
an Uposatha hall had been appointed. On the day of Uposatha a great
assembly of Bhikkhus met together. The Bhikkhus heard the Pâtimokkha
sitting outside the site fixed upon. Now those Bhikkhus thought: 'The
Blessed One has promulgated the precept that Uposatha is to be held
after an Uposatha hall has been fixed upon, and we have heard the
Pâtimokkha sitting outside the site fixed upon. Have we therefore (duly)
held Uposatha or have we not held it?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Whether (a Bhikkhu) be seated inside or outside the site fixed upon,
provided he hears the Pâtimokkha, Uposatha has been duly held by him.

   <span id="9:2"></span>2. 'Therefore, O Bhikkhus, let the Sa*m*gha
determine as large an uposatha-pamukha<span
id="page_252_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_252_note_1.md) as it desires. And it
ought to be determined, O Bhikkhus, in this way: First the landmarks are
to be proclaimed. The landmarks having been proclaimed, let a learned,
competent Bhikkhu proclaim the following *ñ*atti <span id="page_253">p.
253</span> before the Sa*m*gha: "Let the Sa*m*gha, reverend Sirs, hear
me. If the Sa*m*gha is ready, let the Sa*m*gha, as the land marks have
been proclaimed all around, determine an uposathapamukha by these land
marks. This is the *ñ*atti. Let the Sa*m*gha, &c. Thus I understand."'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="10"></span>10.

   At that time in a certain district on the day of Uposatha the young
Bhikkhus, who had assembled first, thought: 'The Theras do not come
yet,' and went away. The Uposatha service was held after the right time.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that on the Uposatha day the Theras ought
to assemble first.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="11"></span>11.

   At that time there were at Râ*g*agaha several residences (of
Bhikkhus) within the same boundary. Now the Bhikkhus quarrelled: (some
of them said), 'The Uposatha shall be held in our residence;' (others
said), 'It shall be held in our residence.'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'There are, O Bhikkhus, several (Bhikkhu) residences within the same
boundary; now the Bhikkus quarrel: (some of them say), "The Uposatha
shall be held in our residence;" (others say), "It shall be held in our
residence." Let those Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, assemble in one place all of
them and hold Uposatha there, or let them assemble where <span
id="page_254">p. 254</span> the senior Bhikkhu dwells and hold Uposatha
there. But in no case is Uposatha to be held by an incomplete
congregation. He who holds it (in that way), commits a dukka*t*a
offence.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="12"></span>12.

   <span id="12:1"></span>1. At that time the reverend Mahâ Kassapa,
when going to the Uposatha from Andhakavinda to Râ*g*agaha, and crossing
a river on his way, was neârly<span
id="page_254_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_254_note_1.md) being carried away (by
the river)<span id="page_254_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_254_note_2.md); and his robes got wet.
The Bhikkhus said to the reverend Mahâ Kassapa: 'How have your robes got
wet, friend?' (He replied): 'As I was going, friends, to the Uposatha
from Andhakavinda to Râ*g*agaha, and crossing a river on my way, I was
nearly being carried away (by the river); thus my robes have become
wet.'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let the Sa*m*gha, O Bhikkhus, confer on the boundary which it has
determined for common <span id="page_255">p. 255</span> residence and
for communion of Uposatha, the I character of ti*k*îvarena
avippavâsa<span id="page_255_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_255_note_1.md).

   <span id="12:2"></span>2. 'And you ought, O Bhikkhus, to confer on it
this character in this way: Let a learned, competent Bhikkhu proclaim
the following *ñ*atti before the Sa*m*gha: "Let the Sa*m*gha, reverend
Sirs, hear me. If the Sa*m*gha is ready, let the Sa*m*gha confer on the
boundary which the Sa*m*gha has determined for common residence and for

is the *ñ*atti. Let the Sa*m*gha (&c., as above). Thus I understand."'

   <span id="12:3"></span>3. At that time the Bhikkhus, considering that
the Blessed One had ordained the conferring of the character of
ti*k*îvarena avippavâsa (on the boundaries), deposited their robes in a
house. Those robes were lost, bumt, or eaten by rats; the Bhikkhus were
badly dressed and had coarse robes. (Other) Bhikkhus said: 'How comes it
that you are badly dressed, friends, and that you have coarse robes?'
(They replied): 'Considering, friends, that the Blessed One had ordained
the conferring (on the boundaries) of the character of ti*k*îvarena
avippavâsa, we deposited our robes in a house; the robes have been lost,
burnt, or eaten by rats; <span id="page_256">p. 256</span> therefore we

boundary ofthat nigama (market town) near which village or nigama (a

   <span id="13:1"></span>1. At that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus
made one boundary overlap another one (which had been determined before
by other Bhikkhus).

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'The act of those who have determined their boundary first is lawful,
unobjectionable, and valid. The act of those who have determined their
boundary afterwards is unlawful, objectionable, and invalid. Let no one,
O Bhikkhus, make one boundary overlap another one. He who does, commits
a dukka*t*a offence.'

   <span id="13:2"></span>2. At that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus
made one boundary encompass another one (which had been determined
before by other Bhikkhus).

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'The act of those, &c. (see § 1). Let no one, O Bhikkhus, make one
boundary encompass another one. He who does, commits a dukka*t*a

Uposatha (days) are there?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

   'There are the following two Uposatha (days), O Bhikkhus, the
fourteenth and the fifteenth (of the half month); these are the two
Uposatha (days), O Bhikkhus.'

   <span id="14:2"></span>2. Now the Bhikkhus thought: 'How many
Uposatha services are there?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'There are the following four Uposatha services. O Bhikkhus: the
Uposatha service which is held unlawfully (by an) incomplete

### <span id="15"></span>15.

   <span id="15:1"></span>1. Now the Bhikkhus thought: 'How many ways
are there of reciting the Pâtimokkha?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'There are the following five ways of reciting the Pâtimokkha: The
introduction<span id="page_260_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_260_note_1.md) having been recited, as
to the rest, it may be proclaimed: "Such and such rules are known (to
the fraternity<span id="page_260_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_260_note_2).md)." This is the first way
of reciting the Pâtimokkha. The introduction having been recited, the
four pârâ*g*ikâ dhammâ having been recited, as to the rest, it may be
proclaimed: "Such and such rules are known (to the fratemity)." This is
the second way of reciting the Pâtimokkha. The introduction having been
recited, the four pârâ*g*ikâ dhammâ having been recited, the thirteen
sa*m*ghâdisesâ dhammâ having been recited, . . . the introduction having
been recited, the four pârâ*g*ikâ dhammâ having been recited, the
thirteen sa*m*ghâdisesâ dhammâ having been recited, the two aniyatâ
dhammâ having been recited, as to the rest, it may be proclaimed: <span
id="page_261">p. 261</span> "Such and such rules are known (to the
fraternity)." This is the fourth way of reciting the Pâtimokkha. The
fifth way is (to recite it) in its full extent. These, O Bhikkhus, are
the five ways of reciting the Pâtimokkha.'

   <span id="15:2"></span>2. At that time the Bhikkhus, considering that
the Blessed One had allowed to recite the Pâtimokkha abridged, always
recited the Pâtimokkha abridged.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'You ought not, O Bhikkhus, to recite the Pâtimokkha abridged. He who
does, commits a dukka*t*a offence.'

   <span id="15:3"></span>3. At that time a certain residence (of
Bhikkhus) in the Kosala country was menaced on the day of Uposatha by
savage people. The Bhikkhus were not able to recite the Pâtimokkha in
its full extent.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, in the case of danger to recite the
Pâtimokkha abridged.'

   <span id="15:4"></span>4. At that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus
(ecited the Pâtimokkha abridged also when there was no danger .

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'You ought not to recite the Pâtimokkha abridged, O Bhikkhus, if
there is no danger. He who does, commits a dukka*t*a offence. I allow
you, O Bhikkhus, in the case of danger only to recite the Pâtimokkha
abridged. The cases of danger are the following: danger from kings, from
robbers, from fire, from water, from human beings, from non-human
beings, from beasts of prey, from creeping things, danger of life,
danger against chastity. I ordain, O Bhikkhus, the recitation in such
cases of danger <span id="page_262">p. 262</span> of the Pâtimokkha
abridged; if there is no danger, in its full extent.'

   <span id="15:5"></span>5. At that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus
preached the Dhamma before the Sa*m*gha without being called upon (by
the Thera).

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, preach the Dhamma before the Sa*m*gha
without being called upon. He who does, commits a dukka*t*a offence. I
prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that the Thera is either to preach the Dhamma
himself or to call upon another (Bhikkhu to do so).'

   <span id="15:6"></span>6. At that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus put
questions about the Vinaya before the Sa*m*gha without being appointed
thereto.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, put questions about the Vinaya before the
Sa*m*gha without being appointed thereto. He who so questions, commits a
dukka*t*a offence. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that an appointed (Bhikkhu)
is to put questions about the Vinaya before the Sa*m*gha. And (this
Bhikkhu) is to be appointed, O Bhikkhus, in this way: One may either
appoint himself, or one may appoint another person.

   <span id="15:7"></span>7. I And how is (a Bhikkhu) to appoint
himself? Let a learned, competent Bhikkhu proclaim the following *ñ*atti
before the Sa*m*gha: "Let the Sa*m*gha, reverend Sirs, hear me. If the
Sa*m*gha is ready, I will question N. N. about the Vinaya." Thus one may
appoint himself. And how is (a Bhikkhu) to appoint another person? Let a
learned, competent Bhikkhu proclaim the following *ñ*atti before the
Sa*m*gha: "Let the Sa*m*gha, &c. If the Sa*m*gha is <span
id="page_263">p. 263</span> ready, let N. N. question N. N. about the
Vinaya." Thus one may appoint another person.'

   <span id="15:8"></span>8. At that time appointed, clever Bhikkhus put
questions about the Vinaya before the Sa*m*gha; The *Kh*abbaggiya
Bhikkhus conceived anger (towards those Bhikkhus), conceived discontent,
and threatened them with blows.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe you, O Bhikkhus, that even he who has been appointed
shall (not) put questions about the Vinaya before the Sa*m*gha (without)
having looked at the assembly and weighed (with the mind each) person
(present).'

   <span id="15:9"></span>9, 10. At that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus
answered questions about the Vinaya before the Sa*m*gha without being
appointed thereto.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus; answer questions about the Vinaya before the
Sa*m*gha without being appointed thereto. He who does, commits a
dukka*t*a offence. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that questions about the
Vinaya are to be answered before the Sa*m*gha (only) by an appointed

### <span id="16"></span>16.

   <span id="16:1"></span>1. At that tlme the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus
reproved for an offence a Bhikkhu who had not given them leave.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   <span id="16:1"></span>1. No Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, who has not given
leave, may be reproved for an offence. He who reproves (such a Bhikkhu),
commits a dukka*t*a offence. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you reprove
(Bhikkhus) for an offence (only) after having asked for leave (by
saying), "Give me leave, reverend brother; I wish to speak to you."'

   <span id="16:2"></span>2. At that time clever Bhikkhus reproved the
*Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus for an offence after having asked for leave. The
*Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus conceived anger (towards those Bhikkhus),
conceived discontent, and threatened them with blows.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you are (not) to reprove (a Bhikkhu)
for an offence, even if he has given leave, (without) having weighed
(with your mind) the person (concerned).'

   <span id="16:3"></span>3. At that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus,
who thought: 'Otherwise clever Bhikkhus might ask us for leave (and
reprove us tor an offence),' themselves asked beforehand pure Bhikkhus
who had committed no offence, for leave without object and reason.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no pure Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, who have committed no offence, be
asked for leave without object and reason. He who does, commits a
dukka*t*a offence. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you <span
id="page_265">p. 265</span> are (not) to ask for leave (without) having
weighed (with your mind) the person (concerned).'

   <span id="16:4"></span>4. At that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus
performed an unlawful official act before the Sa*m*gha.

   They told this thing to the Blcssed One.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, perform unlawful acts before the Sa*m*gha.
He who does, commits a dukka*t*a offence.'

   They performed an unlawful act nevertheless.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you should protest, if an unlawful act
is being performed.'

   <span id="16:5"></span>5. At that time clever Bhikkhus protested at
an unlawful act being performed by the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus. The
*Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus conceived anger, conceived discontent, and
threatened (those Bhikkhus) with blows.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to express your opinion only (instead of
protesting formally).'

   They expressed their opinion in the presence of the said (Bhikkhus).
The *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus conceived anger, conceived discontent, and
threatened (them) with blows.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that four or five persons may protest, that
two or three may express their opinion, and that one person may
determine (in his mind): "I do not think this right."'

   <span id="16:6"></span>6. At that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus,
when reciting the Pâtimokkha before the Sa*m*gha, intentionally recited
it so that it could hot be heard.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let not him who is to recite the Pâtimokkha, <span id="page_266">p.
266</span> O Bhikkhus, intentionally recite it so that it cannot be
heard. He who does, commits a dukka*t*a offence.'

   <span id="16:7"></span>7. At that time the reverend Udâyi, who had a
crow's voice, had the duty to recite the Pâtimokkha before the Sa*m*gha.
Now the reverend Udâyi thought: 'It has been prescribed by the 'Blessed
One that he who is to recite the Pâtimokkha, ought to recite it so that
it may be heard; but I have a crow's voice. Well, how am I to act?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that he who is to recite the Pâtimokkha may
endeavour to make it audible. If he endeavours (to do so), he is free
from offence.'

   <span id="16:8"></span>8. At that time Devadatta recited the
Pâtimokkha before an assembly in which laymen were present.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, recite the Pâtimokkha before an assembly in
which laymen are present. He who does, commits a dukka*t*a offence.'

   <span id="16:9"></span>9. At that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus
recited the Pâtimokkha before the Sa*m*gha without being called upon (by
the Thera).

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, recite the Pâtimokkha before the Sa*m*gha

prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that the Thera is master of the Pâtimokkha<span

### <span id="17"></span>17.

   <span id="17:1"></span>1. Then the Blessed One, after having dwelt
near Râ*g*agaha as long as he thought fit, went forth on his pilgrimage
to *K*odanâvatthu. Going from place to place on his pilgrimage, he came
to *K*odanâvatthu. At that time there dwelt in a certain residence many
Bhikkhus, the eldest of whom was an ignorant, unlearned person: he
neither knew Uposatha, nor the Uposatha service, nor the Pâtimokkha, nor
the recital of the Pâtimokkha.

   <span id="17:2"></span>2. Now those Bhikkhus thought: 'It has been
prescribed by the Blessed One that the eldest Bhikku is master of the
Pâtimokkha, and here the eldest of us is an ignorant, unlearned person:
he neither knows Uposatha . . . nor the recital of the Pâtimokkha. Well,
how are we to act?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that (in such a case) that Bhikkhu who is
(most) learned and competent, is to be made master of the Pâtimokkha.'

   <span id="17:3"></span>3. At that time there dwelt in a certain
residence on the day of Uposatha many ignorant, unlearned Bhikkhus: they
neither knew Uposatha . . . nor the recital of the Pâtimokkha. They
called upon the Thera: 'May it please the Thera, reverend Sir, to recite
the Pâtimokkha.' He replied: 'I am not competent to do so.' They called
upon the next eldest, &c. He also replied, &c. They called upon the
third eldest, &c. In this manner they called upon (all Bhikkhus) down to
the youngest one: 'May it please the reverend brother to recite the
Pâtimokkha.' He also replied: 'I am not competent, venerable Sirs, to do
so.'

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   <span id="17:4"></span>4, 5. 'When, O Bhikkhus, in a certain
residence, &c.<span id="page_268_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_268_note_1.md); in that case, O
Bhikkhus, these Bhikkhus are instantly to send one Bhikkhu to the
neighbouring residence (of Bhikkhus): "Go, friend, and come back when
you have learnt the Pâtimokkha abridged or in its full extent."'

   <span id="17:6"></span>6. Now the Bhikkhus thought: 'By whom is (this
Bhikkhu) to be sent?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that the Thera is to give order to a young
Bhikkhu.'

   The young Bhikkhus, having received that order from the Thera, did
not go.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'Let no one who has been ordered by the Thera forbear to go, unless
he be sick. He who does not go, commits a dukka*t*a offence.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="18"></span>18.

   <span id="18:1"></span>1. Then the Blessed One, after having dwelt at
*K*odanâvatthu as long as he thought fit, went back again to Râ*g*agaha.
At that time the people asked the Bhikkhus who went about for alms:
'What day of the half month is this, reverend Sirs?' The Bhikkus
replied: 'We do not know, friends.' The people were annoyed, murmured,
and became angry: 'Those Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as do not even know how to
count (the days of) the half month; what good things else will they
know?'

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you learn how to count (the days of)
the half month.'

   <span id="18:2"></span>2. Now the Bhikkhus thought: 'Who ought to
learn to count (the days of) the half month?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you learn all of you to count (the
days of) the half month.'

   <span id="18:3"></span>3. At that time the people asked the Bhikkhus
who went about for alms: 'How many Bhikkhus are there, reverend Sirs?'
The Bhikkhus replied: 'We do not know, friends.' The people were
annoyed, murmured, and became angry: 'Those Sakyaputtiya Sama*n*as do
not even know each other; what good things else will they know?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you count the Bhikkhus.'

   <span id="18:4"></span>4. Now the Bhikkhus thought: 'At what time
ought we to count the Bhikkhus?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you count (the Bhikkhus) on the day of
Uposatha, either by way of (counting the single) troops (of which the
assembly is composed)<span id="page_269_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span

of you) a ticket (and count those tickets).'

### <span id="19"></span>19.

   At that time Bhikkhus who did not know that it was Uposatha day, went
for alms to a distant village. <span id="page_270">p. 270</span> They
came back when the Pâtimokkha was being recited, or when it just had
been recited.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus,that you proclaim: "To-day is Uposatha."'

   Now the Bhikkhus thought: 'Who is to proclaim so?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that the Thera is to proclaim (the day of
Uposatha) in due time.'

   At that time a certain Thera did not think of it in due time.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to proclaim it also at meal time.'

   (The Thera) did not think of it at meal time either.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I allow, O Bhikkhus, to proclaim it whenever (the Thera) thinks of
it.'

### <span id="20"></span>20.

   <span id="20:1"></span>1. At that time the Uposatha hall in a certain
residence was full of sweepings. The Bhikkhus who arrived there were
annoyed, murmured, and became angry: 'How can the Bhikkhus neglect to
sweep the Uposatha hall?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus; that you sweep the Uposatha hall.'

sweep the Uposatha hall?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that the Thera is to Order a young Bhikkhu
(to sweep the Uposatha hall). The young Bhikkhus, having received that
order from the Thera, did not sweep it.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'He who has been ordered by the Thera, ought not to forbear to sweep
it, unless he be sick. He who does not sweep it, commits a dukka*t*a
offence.'

in the Uposatha hall. The Bhikkhus sat down on the ground. Their bodies
and their robes became full of dust.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you prepare seats in the Uposatha
hall.'

   Now the Bhikkhus thought, &c. (see § 2).

   'He who does not prepare (seats), commits a dukka*t*a offence.'

   <span id="20:4"></span>4. At that time there was no lamp in the
Uposatha hall. The Bhikkhus in the darkness trod upon (each other's)
bodies and robes.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you light a lamp In te Uposatha hall.'

   Now the Bhikkhus thought, &c. (see § 2).

   'He who does not light (the lanip), commits a dukka*t*a offence.'

   <span id="20:5"></span>5. At that time the resident Bhikkhus in a
certain residence did not provide drink (i.e. water), nor did they
provide food. The incoming Bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became
angry: 'How can the relident Bhikkhus neglect to provide for drink and
to provide for food?'

   They told this thing to the Blessed One. \~

Bhikkus who travelled to the (four) quarters (of the world) did not ask
leave of their â*k*ariyas and upa*ggh*âyas (when going away).

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   'In case, O Bhikkhus, there are many ignorant, unlearned Bhikkhus who

Bhikkhus: 'Assemble, O Bhikkhus, the Sa*m*gha will hold Uposatha.' When
he had spoken thus, a certain Bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: 'There is
a sick Bhikkhu, Lord, who is not present.'

his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, sit down squatting, raise
his joined hands, and say: "I declare my pârisuddhi, take my pârisuddhi,
proclaim my pârisuddhi (before the fraternity)." Whether he <span

or by word or by gesture and word, the pârisuddhi has been declared. If
he does not express this by gesture, &c., the pârisuddhi has not been
declared.

so, well and good. If he does not succeed, let them take that sick
Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, on his bed or his chair to the assembly, and (then)
let them hold Uposatha. If, O Bhikkhus, the Bhikkhus who are nursing the
sick, think: "If we move this sick person from his place, the sickness
will increase, or he will die," let them not move the sick, O Bhikkhus,
from his place; let the Sa*m*gha go there and hold there Uposatha. But
in no case are they to hold Uposatha with an incomplete congregation. If

   Then the BIessed One thus addressed the Bhikkus: 'Assemble, O

Bhikkhus: 'Assemble, O Bhikkhus, the Sa*m*gha <span id="page_279">p.

thus, a certain Bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: 'There is a mad
Bhikkhu, Lord, called Gagga, who is not present.' 'There are, O
Bhikkhus, two sorts of madmen: There is one mad Bhikkhu who now
remembers the Uposatha, now does not remember it, who now remembers
official acts (of the Order), now does not remember them, (and) there is
(another mad Bhikkhu) who does not remember them; one who now goes to

name nor the class to which that offence belonged. Now there arrived (at
that place) another Bhikkhu, &c. (see chap. 21. 2), anxious for
training. To that Bhikkhu one of the Bhikkhus went, and having gone to
him, he said to him: 'He who does such and such a thing, friend, what
sort of offence does he commit?'

   <span id="27:11"></span>11. He replied: 'He who does such and such a
thing, friend, commits such and such an offence. If you have committed
such an offence, friend, atone for that offence.' The other replied:
'Not I myself alone, friend, am guilty of that offence; this whole
Sa*m*gha is guilty of that offence.' He said: 'What is it to you,
friend, whether another is guilty or guiltless? Come, friend, atone for
your own offence.'

   <span id="27:12"></span>12. Now this Bhikkhu, after having atoned for
<span id="page_286">p. 286</span> that offence by the advice of that
Bhikkhu, went to those Bhikkhus (to his brethren who shared in the same
offence); having gone to them, he said to those Bhikkhus: 'He who does
such and such a thing, friends, commits such and such an offence. As you
have committed such an offence, friends, atone for that offence.' Now
those Bhikkhus refused to atone for that offence by that Bhikkhu's
advice.

   They told this thing to the Blessed One.

   <span id="27:13"></span>13, 14. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, the whole
Sa*m*gha in a certain residence is guilty of a common offence, &c. (§§
10, 11)--

   <span id="27:15"></span>15. 'If this Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, after
having atoned for that offence by the advice of that Bhikkhu, goes to
those Bhikkhus, and having gone to them, says to those Bhikkhus: "He who
does, &c.," and if those Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, atone for that offence by
that Bhikkhu's advice, well and good; if they do not atone for it, that
Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, need not say anything (further) to those Bhikkhus,
if he does not like.'

<span id="page_239_note_1"></span>[1](#page_239_fr_1.md) One should be
inclined to understand that the Paribbâ*g*akas assembled twice each half
month, on the eighth day of the pakkha and on the fourteenth or
fifteenth day, according to the different length of the pakkha. However,
chap. 4 makes it probable that not two days in each pakkha are to be
understood, but three. Compare, however, the remark of Buddhaghosa,
quoted in the note on chap. 34. 1.

<span id="page_242_note_1"></span>[1](#page_242_fr_1.md) See chap. 22. If a
Bhikkhu is prevented by distase from assisting to the Pâtimokkha
ceremony, he is to charge another Bhikkhu with his pârisuddhi, i.e. with
the solemn declaration that he is pure from the offences specified in
the Pâtimokkha.

<span id="page_242_note_2"></span>[2](#page_242_fr_2.md) These words are
evidently the answer of the Bhikkhus then present to the proclamation of

explanation, word by word, of the formula given in § 3. This explanation
is a portion of the ancient commentarf on the Pâtimokkha which at the

in its full extent (see the Introduction, [p. xv](sbe1302.htm#page_xv.md)

of offences are, the pârâ*g*ika, sa*m*ghâdisesa, pâ*k*ittiya,
pâ*t*idesaniya, dukka*t*a offences; the seven classes, the pârâ*g*ika,
sa*m*ghâdisesa, thulla*kk*aya, pâ*k*ittiya, pâ*t*idesaniya, dukka*t*a,

<span id="footnotes_page_245">p. 245</span>

<span id="page_245_note_1"></span>[1](#page_245_fr_1.md) The Pâli text has
' dukka*t*a.' We cannot interpret here dukka*t*a in the technical sense
of a dukka*t*a offence (see the Introduction, [p.
xxiv](sbe1302.htm#page_xxiv).md), for intentional falsehood belongs to the
class of the pâ*k*ittiya offences, among which it occupies the first
place.

<span id="page_252_note_1"></span>[1](#page_252_fr_1.md) Uposatha-pamukha
(literally, that which has the Uposatha at its head, or, that which is
situated in front of the Uposatha) evidently means the place around the
uposathâgâra, in which the Pâtimokkha recitation may be heard as well as
in the uposathâgâra itself.

l 'Mana*m* vu*lh*o ahosi.' Buddhaghosa: 'îsaka*m* appattavu*lh*abhâvo
ahosi.' Mana*m* is evidently the equivalent of Sanskrit manâk.

<span id="page_254_note_2"></span>[2](#page_254_fr_2.md) Buddhaghosa's note
on this passage contains some details regarding the way which Mahâ
Kassapa went. Andhakavinda is three gâvuta distant from Râ*g*agaha.
There were eighteen (? the MS. reads: a*tth*âra mahâvihârâ) great
Vihâras around Râ*g*agaha included by the same boundary which Buddha
himself had consecrated. The Uposatha service for this whole district
was performed in the Ve*l*uvana monastery. The river which Mahâ Kassapa
crossed on his way to the Ve*l*uvana was the Sappinî, which rises in the
Gi*ggh*akû*t*a mountain.

<span id="page_255_note_1"></span>[1](#page_255_fr_1.md) Ti*k*îvarena
avippavâsa means not parting with the three robes which belong to the
usual 'parikkhârâ ' (requisites) of a Bhikkhu. Bhikkhus were not allowed
to part with their *k*îvaras, excepting under special circumstances and
for a limited time (see the Pâtimokkha, 29th nissaggiya dhamma).
Conferring the character of ti*k*îvarena avippavâsa on a boundary means,
we believe, to determine that it should be free to Bhikkhus residing
within this boundary, to keep a set of robes wherever they liked within
the same boundary (excepting in a village, § 3), and that such an act
should not be considered as parting with the robes.

<span id="footnotes_page_256">p. 256</span>

<span id="page_256_note_1"></span>[1](#page_256_fr_1.md) Buddhaghosa
observes that this rule applies to Bhikkhus only, and not to Bhikkhunîs.
For Bhikkhunîs reside only in villages; there would be no
*k*îvaraparihâra at all for Bhikkhunîs, if they were to use the
kammavâ*k*â given in § 4. Buddhaghosa also observes at this occasion
that the boundaries of the Bhikkhusa*m*gha and of the Bhikkhunîsa*m*gha
are quite independent from each other, and that the rules given in chap.
13 do not refer to boundaries the one of which belongs to the
Bhikkhusa*m*gha, the other to the Bhikkhunîsa*m*gha.

<span id="page_256_note_2"></span>[2](#page_256_fr_2.md) As to the extent
attributed to the 'gâmûpa*k*âra' (neighbourhood of the village), see the

<span id="page_256_note_3"></span>[3](#page_256_fr_3.md) This formula is
identical with that given in § 2. The only difference is that after the

that this is the correct translation or vibbhamati (see I, 39, 5). The
difference between vibbhamati (he returns to the world) and sikkha*m*

an informal, and the latter a formal, renunciation or the Order.

<span id="page_275_note_3"></span>[3](#page_275_fr_3.md) The precepts are
abandoned (sikkhâ pa*kk*akkhitâ hoti) by declaring that one abandons the
Buddha, or the Dhamma, or the Sa*m*gha, or the Vinaya, &c. By such a
declaration a Bhikkhu who wishes to return to a layman's life, or to go
over to a Titthiya sect, gives up his character as a member of the
Buddhist fraternity, The rules about the sikkhâpa*kk*akkhâna are given

these triads contain the words: 'They know that there are other resident

follow from this remark of Buddhaghosa that after an Uposatha on the

Uposatha may not be held on the fourteenth ad libitum, but only in the
second pakkha of the short months. Compare chap. 4 and the note on chap.

which time they were to ask for the upasampadâ ordination. During these
two years the candidates were called sikkhamâ*n*âs. Childers (Dict. s.v.
sikkhati) has misunderstood the Mahâva*m*sa (p. 37), when he states that
