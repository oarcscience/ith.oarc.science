But again (according to your people) the devout layman who has entered the Excellent Way, for whom the possibility of rebirth in any place of woe has passed away, who has attained to insight, and to whom the doctrine is known, even such a one ought to salute and to rise from his seat in token of respect for, and to revere, any member of the Order, though a novice, and though he be unconverted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_465"></A><A HREF="#fn_456"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.

By being deficient in none of them, by being perfect in all, accomplished in all, endowed with all of them does he reach forward to the condition of Arahatship, to the condition of those who have nothing left to learn; he is marching towards the highest of all lands&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_481"></A><A HREF="#fn_472"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>. Thus it is because he sees him to be in the company of the Worthy Ones (the Arahats) that the layman who has already entered on the Excellent Way thinks it worthy in him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_482"></A><A HREF="#fn_473"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> to</P>

<P>reverence and to show respect to the Bhikkhu, though <A HREF="errata.htm#0">he</A> may be, as yet, unconverted. It is because he sees him to be in the company of those in whom all evil has been destroyed, because he feels that he is not in such society&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_483"></A><A HREF="#fn_474"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, that the converted layman thinks it worthy of him to do reverence and to show respect to the unconverted Bhikkhu. It is because he knows that he has joined the noblest brotherhood, and that he himself has reached no such state, that the converted layman holds it right to do reverence and to show respect to the unconverted Bhikkhu--because he knows that he listens to the recitation of the P&acirc;timokkha, while he himself can not--because he knows that he receives men into the Order, and thus extends the teaching of the Conqueror, which he himself is incapable of doing--because he knows that he carries out innumerable precepts, which he himself cannot observe--because he knows that he wears the outward signs of Sama<I>n</I>aship, and carries out the intention of the Buddha, while he himself is gone away far from that--because he knows that he, though he has given up his hair and beard, and is unanointed and wears no ornaments, yet is anointed with the perfume of righteousness, while he is himself addicted to jewelry and fine apparel--that the converted layman thinks it right to do reverence, and to show respect to the unconverted Bhikkhu.'</P>
<P>3. 'And moreover, O king, it is because he knows that not only are all these twenty personal qualities which go to make a Sama<I>n</I>a, and the two outward signs, found in the Bhikkhu, but that he carries them</P>

<P>on, and trains others in them, that the converted layman, realising that he has no part in that tradition&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_484"></A><A HREF="#fn_475"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, in that maintenance of the faith, thinks it right to reverence and to show respect to the converted Bhikkhu. [<B>164</B>] Just, O king, as a royal prince who learns his knowledge, and is taught the duties of a Khattiya, at the feet of the Brahman who acts as family chaplain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_485"></A><A HREF="#fn_476"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, when after a time he is anointed king, pays, reverence and respect to his master in the thought of his being the teacher, and the carrier on of the traditions of the family, so is it right for the converted Bhikkhu to do reverence and to pay respect to the unconverted Bhikkhu.'</P>
<P>4. 'And moreover, O king, you may know by this fact the greatness and the peerless glory of the condition of the Bhikkhus--that if a layman, a disciple of the faith, who has entered upon the Excellent Way, should attain to the realisation of Arahatship, one of two results must happen to him, and there is no other--he must either die away on that very day, or take upon himself the condition of a Bhikkhu. For immovable, O king, is that state of renunciation, glorious, and most exalted--I mean the condition of being a member of the Order!'</P>
<P>'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, this subtle problem has been thoroughly unravelled by your powerful and great wisdom. No one else could solve it so unless he were wise as you.'</P>

</FONT><H3 ALIGN="CENTER">[THE HARM OF PREACHING.]</H3>
<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>5. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, you Bhikkhus say that the Tath&acirc;gata averts harm from all beings, and does them good&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_486"></A><A HREF="#fn_477"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. And again you say that when he was preaching the discourse based on the simile of the burning fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_487"></A><A HREF="#fn_478"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> hot blood was ejected from the mouths of about sixty Bhikkhus. By his delivery of that discourse he did those Bhikkhus harm and not good. So if the first statement is correct, the second is false; and if the second is correct, the first [<B>165</B>] is false. This too is a double-pointed problem put to you, which you have to solve.'</P>
<P>6. 'Both are true. What happened to them was not the Tath&acirc;gata's doing, but their own.'</P>
<P>'But, N&acirc;gasena, if the Tath&acirc;gata had not delivered that discourse, then would they have vomited up hot blood?'</P>
<P>'No. When they took wrongly what he said, then was there a burning kindled within them, and hot blood was ejected from their mouths.'</P>
<P>'Then that must have happened, N&acirc;gasena, through the act of the Tath&acirc;gata, it must have been the Tath&acirc;gata who was the chief cause&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_488"></A><A HREF="#fn_479"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> to destroy them. Suppose a serpent, N&acirc;gasena, had crept into an anthill, and a man in want of earth were to break into the anthill, and take the earth of it away. And by his doing so the entrance-hole to the anthill</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_235"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 235</FONT></A></P>
<P>were closed up, and the snake were to die in consequence from want of air. Would not the serpent have been killed by that man's action?'</P>
<P>'Yes, O king.'</P>
<P>'Just so, N&acirc;gasena, was the Tath&acirc;gata the prime cause of their destruction.'</P>
<P>7. 'When the Tath&acirc;gata delivered a discourse, O king, he never did so either in flattery or in malice. In freedom both from the one and from the other did he speak. And they who received it aright were made wise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_489"></A><A HREF="#fn_480"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, but they who received it wrongly, fell. Just, O king, as when a man shakes a mango tree or a jambu tree or a mee tree&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_490"></A><A HREF="#fn_481"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, such of the fruits on it as are full of sap and strongly fastened to it remain undisturbed, but such as have rotten stalks, and are loosely attached, fall to the ground--[<B>166</B>] so was it with his preaching. It was, O king, as when a husbandman, wanting to grow a crop of wheat, ploughs the field, but by that ploughing many hundreds and thousands of blades of grass are killed--or it was as when men, for the sake of sweetness, crush sugarcane in a mill, and by their doing so such small creatures as pass into the mouth of the mill are crushed also--so was it that the Tath&acirc;gata making wise those whose minds were prepared, preached the Dhamma without flattery and without malice. And they who received it aright were made wise, but they who received it wrongly, fell.'</P>
<P>8. Then did not those Bhikkhus fall, N&acirc;gasena, just because of that discourse?'</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_236"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 236</FONT></A></P>
<P>'How, then, could a carpenter by doing nothing to a piece of timber, and simply laying it by&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_491"></A><A HREF="#fn_482"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, make it straight and fit for use?'</P>
<P>'No, Sir. He would have to get rid of the bends out of it, if he wanted it straight and ready for use.'</P>
<P>'Just so, O king, the Tath&acirc;gata could not, by merely watching over his disciples, have opened the eyes of those who were ready to see. But by getting rid of those who took the word wrongly he saved those prepared to be saved. And it was by their own act and deed, O king, that the evil-minded fell; just as a plantain tree, or a bamb&ucirc;, or a she-mule are destroyed by that to which they themselves give birth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_492"></A><A HREF="#fn_483"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. And just, O king, as it is by their own acts that robbers come to have their eyes plucked out, or to impalement, or to the scaffold, just so were the evil-minded destroyed by their own act, and fell from the teaching of the Conqueror.'</P>
<P>9. 'And so [<B>167</B>] with those sixty Bhikkhus, they fell neither by the act of the Tath&acirc;gata nor of any one else, but solely by their own deed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_493"></A><A HREF="#fn_484"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Suppose, O king, a man were to give ambrosia&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_494"></A><A HREF="#fn_485"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> to all the people, and they, eating of it, were to become healthy and long-lived and free from every bodily ill. But one man, on eating it, were by his own bad digestion, to</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_237"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 237</FONT></A></P>
<P>die. Would then, O king, the man who gave away the ambrosia be guilty therein of any offence?'</P>
<P>'No, Sir.'</P>
<P>'Just so, O king, does the Tath&acirc;gata present the gift of his ambrosia to the men and gods in the ten thousand world systems; and those beings who are capable of doing so are made wise by the nectar of his law, while they who are not are destroyed and fall. Food, O king, preserves the lives of all beings. But some who eat of it die of cholera&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_495"></A><A HREF="#fn_486"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Is the man who feeds the hungry guilty therein of any offence?'</P>
<P>'No, Sir.'</P>
<P>'Just so, O king, does the Tath&acirc;gata present the gift of his ambrosia to the men and gods in the ten thousand world systems; and those beings who are capable of doing so are made wise by the nectar of his law, while they who are not are destroyed and fall.'</P>

There is no fault of speech in the Tath&acirc;gata concerning which he should have to take care that no one else should know it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_496"></A><A HREF="#fn_487"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>." And on the other hand the Tath&acirc;gata, when promulgating the first P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika on the occasion of the offence of Sudinna the Kalanda&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_497"></A><A HREF="#fn_488"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, addressed him with harsh words, calling him a useless fellow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_498"></A><A HREF="#fn_489"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. And that Elder, on being so called, terrified with the fear of his teacher&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_499"></A><A HREF="#fn_490"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and overcome with remorse, was unable to comprehend the Excellent Way&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_500"></A><A HREF="#fn_491"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. Now if the first statement be correct, the allegation that the Tath&acirc;gata called Sudinna the Kalanda a useless fellow must be false. But if that be true, then the first statement must be false. [<B>171</B>] This too is a double-pointed problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.'</P>
<P>16. 'What S&acirc;riputta the Elder said is true, O king. And the Blessed One called Sudinna a useless fellow on that occasion. But that was not out of rudeness of disposition&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_501"></A><A HREF="#fn_492"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, it was merely pointing out the real nature (of his conduct) in a way that would do him no harm&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_502"></A><A HREF="#fn_493"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>.

Therefore is it that he is called a useless fellow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_504"></A><A HREF="#fn_495"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. And so the Blessed One addressed Sudinna the Kalanda with words of truth, and not with words apart from the facts.'</P>
<P>17. 'But, N&acirc;gasena, though a man in abusing another speaks the truth, still we should inflict a small&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_505"></A><A HREF="#fn_496"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> fine upon him.

<P>'Have you ever heard, O king, of a people bowing down before, or rising up from their seats in respect for, or showing honour to, or bringing the complimentary presents (usually given to officials) to a criminal?'</P>
<P>'No, if a man have committed a crime of whatever sort or kind, if he be really worthy of reproof and punishment, they would rather behead him, or torture</P>

<P>'Did then the Blessed One, O king, act with justice or not?'</P>
<P>'With justice, Sir, and in a most fit and proper way. And when, N&acirc;gasena, they hear of it the world of men and gods will be made tender of conscience, and afraid of falling into sin, struck with awe at the sight of it, and still more so when they themselves associate with wrong-doers, or do wrong.'</P>
<P>18. [<B>172</B>] 'Now would a physician, O king, administer pleasant things as a medicine in a case where all the humours of the body were affected, and the whole frame was disorganised and full of disease?'</P>
<P>'No. Wishing to put an end to the disease he would give sharp and scarifying drugs.'</P>
<P>'In the same way, O king, the Tath&acirc;gata bestows admonition for the sake of suppressing all the diseases of sin. And the words of the Tath&acirc;gata, even when stern, soften men and make them tender. Just as hot water, O king, softens and makes tender anything capable of being softened, so are the words of the Tath&acirc;gata, even when stern, yet as full of benefit, and as full of pity as the words of a father would be to his children. Just, O king, as the drinking of evil-smelling decoctions, the swallowing of nasty drugs, destroys the weaknesses of men's bodies, so are the words of the Tath&acirc;gata even when stern, bringers of advantage and laden with pity. And</P>

<P><A NAME="page_241"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 241</FONT></A></P>
<P>just, O king, as a ball of cotton falling on a man raises no bruise, so do the words of the Tath&acirc;gata, even when stern, do no harm.'</P>

<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>19. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, the Tath&acirc;gata said:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Brahman! why do you ask an unconscious thing,<BR>
Which cannot hear you, how it does to-day?<BR>
Active, intelligent, and full of life,<BR>
How can you speak to this so senseless thing-<BR>

<P>'Now if, N&acirc;gasena, a tree is an unconscious thing, it must be false that the Aspen tree spoke to Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<I>g</I>a. But if that is true, it must be false to say that a tree is unconscious. This too is a double-edged problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.'</P>
<P>20. The Master said, N&acirc;gasena, that a tree is unconscious. And the Aspen tree conversed with Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<I>g</I>a. But that last is said, O king, by a common form of speech. For though a tree being unconscious cannot talk, yet the word "tree" is used</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_242"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 242</FONT></A></P>
<P>as a designation of the dryad who dwells therein, and in that sense that "the tree talks" is a well-known expression. just, O king, as a waggon laden with corn is called a corn-waggon. But it is not made of corn, it is made of wood, yet because of the corn being heaped up in it the people use the expression "corn-waggon." Or just, O king, as when a man is churning sour milk the common expression is that he is churning butter. But it is not butter that he is churning, but milk. Or just, O king, as when a man is making something that does not exist the common expression is that he is making that thing which all the while as yet is not, [<B>174</B>] but people talk of the work as accomplished before it is done. And the Tath&acirc;gata, when expounding the Dhamma, does so by means of the phraseology which is in common use among the people.'</P>

Now if sharp sickness fell upon the Blessed One, N&acirc;gasena, after he had partaken of Kunda's alms, and sharp pains arose within him even unto death, then that other statement must be wrong. But if that is right then the first must be wrong. How could that alms, N&acirc;gasena, be of great fruit when it turned to poison, gave rise to disease, [<B>175</B>] put an end to the period of his then existence, took away his life? Explain this to me to the refutation of the adversaries. The people are in bewilderment about this, thinking that the dysentery must have been caused by his eating too much, out of greediness.'</P>
<P>22. 1 The Blessed One said, O king, that there were two almsgivings equal, of equal fruit, and equal result, and of much greater fruit, and much greater result than any others,--that which, when a Tath&acirc;gata has partaken of it, he attains to supreme and perfect Buddhahood (Enlightenment), and that when he has partaken of which, he passes away by that utter passing away in which nothing whatever remains behind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_514"></A><A HREF="#fn_505"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. For that alms is full of virtue, full of advantage. The gods, O king, shouted in joy and gladness at the thought: "This is the last meal the Tath&acirc;gata will take," and communicated a divine power of nourishment to that tender</P>

And that was itself in good condition, light, pleasant, full of flavour, and good for digestion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_516"></A><A HREF="#fn_507"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. It was not because of it that any sickness fell upon the Blessed One, but it was because of the extreme weakness of his body, and because of the period of life he had to live having been exhausted, that the disease arose, and grew worse and worse--just as when, O king, an ordinary fire is burning, if fresh fuel be supplied, it will burn up still more--or [<B>176</B>] as when a stream is flowing along as usual, if a</P>

<P>23. 'But, venerable N&acirc;gasena, why is it that those two gifts of food are so specially meritorious?'</P>
<P>'Because of the attainment of the exalted conditions which resulted from them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_517"></A><A HREF="#fn_508"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</P>

<P>'It was on two days, was it not, N&acirc;gasena, that the Tath&acirc;gata attained to those conditions in the highest degree?'</P>
<P>'Yes, O king&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_519"></A><A HREF="#fn_510"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</P>

As might be expected it is not seldom found in the Buddhist Suttas, and is often put in the mouth of the Buddha, the most distinguished of these Khattiyas who were transcendental rather than military. It runs: 'The Khattiya is the best in the world of those who observe the rules of exogamous marriage, but of the whole race of men and gods he who has wisdom and righteousness is the best.' See, for instance, the Amba<I>tth</I>a Sutta, in the D&icirc;gha Nik&acirc;ya, and the Suma<U>n</U>gala Vil&acirc;sin&icirc; on that passage. By 'best in the world' is meant 'entitled to take precedence before all others,' not best in the moral sense.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_506"></A><A HREF="sbe3514.htm#fr_515">244:1</A> S&ucirc;kara-maddava. There is great doubt as to the exact meaning of this name of the last dish the Buddha partook of. Maddati is 'to rub,' or 'to press,' or 'to trample,' and just as 'pressed beef' is ambiguous, so is 'boar-pressed' or 'pork-tender' capable of various interpretations. The exegetical gloss as handed down in the Mah&acirc; Vih&acirc;ra in Anur&acirc;dhapure, Ceylon, in the now lost body of tradition called the Mah&acirc; A<I>tth</I>akath&acirc;, has been preserved by Dhammap&acirc;la in his comment on Ud&acirc;na VIII, 5 (p. 81 of Dr, Steinthal's edition for the P&acirc;li Text Society). It means, I think, 'Meat pervaded by the tenderness and niceness of boar's (flesh).' But that is itself ambiguous, and Dhammap&acirc;la adds that others say the word means not pork or meat at all, but 'the tender top sprout of the bamb&ucirc; plant after it has been trampled upon by swine'--others again that it means a kind of mushroom that grows in ground trodden under foot by swine--others again that it means only a particular kind of flavouring, or sauce. As Maddana is rendered by Childers 'withered,' I have translated it in my 'Buddhist Suttas' (pp. 71-73) 'dried boar's flesh.' But the fact is that the exact sense is not known. (Maddav&acirc;ni pupph&acirc;ni at Dhammapada 377 is 'withered flowers,' according to Fausb&ouml;ll. But it may be just as well 'tender flowers,' especially as M&acirc;rdava in Sanskrit always means 'tender, pitiful,' &amp;c. This is the only passage where the word is known to occur in P&acirc;li apart from those in which s&ucirc;kara-maddava is mentioned.) The Si<I>m</I>halese here (p. 230) repeats the word and adds the gloss: E taru<I>n</I>u w&ucirc; &ucirc;ru ma<I>m</I>sayehi.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_533"></A><A HREF="sbe3514.htm#fr_542">253:2</A> From the Sela, Sutta in the Sutta Nip&acirc;ta (III, 7, 7). Professor Fausb&ouml;ll in his translation of this stanza (at vol. x, p. 102 of the 'Sacred Books of the East') draws attention to the parallel at John xviii. 37. 'Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born. And for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth'--where 'truth,' if one translated the verse into P&acirc;li, would be correctly rendered by Dhamma, 'righteousness, religion, truth, essential quality.' Professor Fausb&ouml;ll's version of the stanza runs: 'I am a king, O Sela, an incomparable religious (Dhamma-r&acirc;<I>g</I>a) king, with justice (Dhamma). I turn the wheel, a wheel that is irresistible.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_534"></A><A HREF="sbe3514.htm#fr_543">254:1</A> From the 521st <I>G</I>&acirc;taka.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_535"></A><A HREF="sbe3514.htm#fr_544">254:2</A> The crux lies in the ambiguity of this phrase as will be seen below.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_536"></A><A HREF="sbe3514.htm#fr_545">254:3</A> Vadha, which is ambiguous, and means also 'killing.' The Si<I>m</I>halese repeats the word.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_538"></A><A HREF="sbe3514.htm#fr_547">254:5</A> Santati-vikopana<I>m</I>, literally 'breach of continuity.' H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc; explains it to mean 'injury to the duration of life,' and this may be the author's meaning, as he is fond of heaping together a string of words, some of which mean the same thing. But as <A NAME="page_255"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 255</FONT></A> santati means also 'lineage, descent,' the phrase may equally well refer to the sort of punishment I have ventured to put into the text.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_539"></A><A HREF="sbe3514.htm#fr_548">255:1</A> Ariyo and anariyo used technically in the sense of one who has not, and one who has, entered upon the Noble Eightfold Path.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_540"></A><A HREF="sbe3514.htm#fr_549">256:1</A> Coro probably here used figuratively of a member of the Order who is unworthy of it, and injures believing laymen. So the word is used, for instance, in the introductory story (in the Sutta Vibhanga) to the fourth P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika--where four sorts of such religious 'robbers' are distinguished (compare our 'wolf in sheep's clothing'). But the king takes it literally.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_541"></A><A HREF="sbe3514.htm#fr_550">256:2</A> The three words in brackets are H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc;'s gloss.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_542"></A><A HREF="sbe3514.htm#fr_551">257:1</A> From the Dhaniya Sutta in the Sutta Nip&acirc;ta (1, 2, 2).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_543"></A><A HREF="sbe3514.htm#fr_552">257:2</A> The episode here referred to will be found in the Magghima Nik&acirc;ya, No. 67. H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc; gives it in full. The Buddha was staying at the &Acirc;malak&icirc; garden near the S&acirc;kya town called <I>K</I>&acirc;tum&acirc;. There the two elders with their attendant 500 disciples came to call upon him. 'The resident Bhikkhus received them with applause, and a great hubbub arose. The Buddha enquired what that noise was, like the chattering of fishermen when a net full of fishes was drawn to shore. &Acirc;nanda told him. Thereupon the Buddha called the brethren together, made a discourse to them on the advantages of quiet, and 'sent away' the visitors. They went to the public rest-house in the town. The town's folk enquired why, and <A NAME="page_259"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 259</FONT></A> when they heard the reason, went to the Buddha, and obtained his forgiveness for the offending brethren. The incident is the basis of another question below, IV, 4, 41.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_544"></A><A HREF="sbe3514.htm#fr_553">258:1</A> Pa<I>n</I>&acirc;mesi means, in the technical legal phraseology of the Buddhist canon law, 'formally dismissed, sent away, did not allow them any more to be his disciples,' On this technical meaning of the term, compare Mah&acirc;vagga I, 2, 27, and <I>K</I>ullavagga XII, 2, 3. (Childers does not give this use of the word.) But it is difficult to imagine the circumstances under which the Buddha could so have dismissed his two principal disciples. So I think we must take the word in a less formal sense-such, for instance, as we find in Thera G&acirc;th&acirc; 511, 557.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_545"></A><A HREF="sbe3514.htm#fr_554">258:2</A> Eta<I>m</I> t&acirc;va <I>g</I>&acirc;n&acirc;hi ima<I>m</I> n&acirc;m&acirc;ti. I follow H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc;'s rendering (p. 244) of this difficult phrase, according to which there ought to be a full stop in the text after pa<I>n</I>&acirc;mesi, and these words are supposed to be addressed to N&acirc;gasena by Milinda. But I am not at all satisfied that he is right, and the text may be corrupt.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_546"></A><A HREF="sbe3514.htm#fr_555">259:1</A> This supposed fact is already the ground of a comparison in the <I>K</I>ullavagga IX, 1, 3, 4 ('Vinaya Texts,' III, 303)</P>
