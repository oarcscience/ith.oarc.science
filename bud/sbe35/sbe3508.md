# BOOK III.

## VIMATI-*KKH*EDANA-PA*Ñ*HO.

### THE REMOVAL OF DIFFICULTIES.

## CHAPTER 4 <span id="fr_245"></span>[1](#fn_241.md).

1\. \[**65**\] The king said: 'Are the five Âyatanas, Nâgasena, (eye,
ear, nose, tongue, and body,) produced by various actions, or by one
action?' (that is, the result of various Karmas, or of one Karma.)

'By various actions, not by one.'

'Give me an illustration.'

'Now, what do you think, O king? If I were to sow in one field five
kinds of seed, would the produce of those various seeds be of different
kinds?'

'Yes, certainly.'

'Well, just so with respect to the production of Âyatanas.'

'Very good, Nâgasena <span id="fr_246"></span>[2](#fn_242.md)!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2\. The king said: 'Why is it, Nâgasena, that all men are not alike, but
some are short-lived and some long-lived, some sickly and some healthy,
some ugly and some beautiful, some without influence and some of great
power, some poor and some wealthy, some low born and some high born,
some stupid and somewise?'

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

The Elder replied: 'Why is it that all vegetables are not alike, but
some sour, and some salt, and some pungent, and some acid, and some
astringent, and some sweet?'

'I fancy, Sir, it is because they come from different kinds of seeds.'

'And just so, great king, are the differences you have mentioned among
men to be explained. For it has been said by the Blessed One: "Beings, O
brahmin, have each their own Karma, are inheritors of Karma, belong to
the tribe of their Karma, are relatives by Karma, have each their Karma
as their protecting overlord. It is Karma that divides them up into low
and high and the like divisions <span id="fr_247"></span>[1](#fn_243.md)."'

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3\. The king said: 'You told me, Nâgasena, that your renunciation was to
the end that this sorrow might perish away, and no further sorrow might
spring up <span id="fr_248"></span>[2](#fn_244.md).'

\[**66**\] 'Yes, that is so.'

'But is that renunciation brought about by previous effort, or to be
striven after now, in this present time?'

The Elder replied: 'Effort is now concerned with what still remains to
be done, former effort has accomplished what it had to do.'

'Give me an illustration <span id="fr_249"></span>[3](#fn_245.md).'

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

'Now what do you think, O king? Is it when you feel thirst that you
would set to work to have a well or an artificial lake dug out, with the
intention of getting some water to drink?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'Just so, great king, is effort concerned now with what still remains to
be done, former effort has accomplished what it had to do.'

'Give me a further illustration.'

'Now what do you think, O king? Is it when you feel hungry that you set
to work to have fields ploughed and seed planted and crops reaped with
the intention of getting some food to eat?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'Just so, great king, is effort concerned now with what still remains to
be done, former effort has accomplished what it had to do.'

'Give me a further illustration.'

'Now what do you think, O king? Is it when the battle is set in array
against you that you set to work to have a moat dug, and a rampart put
up, and a watch tower built, and a stronghold formed, and stores of food
collected? Is it then that you would have yourself taught the management
of elephants, or horsemanship, or the use of the chariot and the bow, or
the art of fencing?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'Just so, great king, is effort concerned now with what still remains to
be done, former effort has accomplished what it had to do. For it has
been thus said, O king, by the Blessed One:

"Betimes let each wise man work out  
That which he sees to be his weal!  
Not with the carter's mode of thought, but firm <span id="page_103">p.
103</span>  
Let him, with resolution, step right out.  
As a carter who has left the smooth high road,  
And turned to byways rough, broods ill at ease <span
id="fr_250"></span>[1](#fn_246.md)--  
(Like him who hazards all at dice, and fails)--  
So the weak mind who still neglects the good,  
And follows after evil, grieves at heart,  
When fallen into the power of death, as he,  
The ruined gamester, in his hour of need <span
id="fr_251"></span>[2](#fn_247.md)."

\[**67**\] 'Very good, Nâgasena.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

4\. The king said: 'You (Buddhists <span
id="fr_252"></span>[3](#fn_248).md) say thus: "The fire of purgatory is
very much more fierce than an ordinary fire. A small stone cast into an
ordinary fire may smoke for a day without being destroyed; but a rock as
big as an upper chamber cast into the furnace of purgatory would be that
moment destroyed." That is a statement I cannot believe. Now, on the
other hand you say thus: "Whatsoever beings are there reborn, though
they

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

burn for hundreds of thousands of years in purgatory, yet are they not
destroyed." That too is a statement 1 don't believe.'

The Elder said: 'Now what do you think, O king? Do not the females of
sharks <span id="fr_253"></span>[1](#fn_249.md) and crocodiles and
tortoises and peacocks and pigeons eat hard bits of stone and gravel?'

'Yes, Sir. They do.'

'What then? Are these hard things, when they have got into the stomach,
into the interior of the abdomen, destroyed?'

'Yes, they are destroyed.'

'And the embryo that may be inside the same animals,--is that too
destroyed?'

'Certainly not.'

'But why not.'

'I suppose, Sir, it escapes destruction by the influence of Karma.'

'Just so, great king, it is through the influence of Karma that beings,
though they have been for thousands of years in purgatory, are not
destroyed. If they are reborn there, there do they grow up, and there do
they die. For this, O king, has been declared by the Blessed One: "He
does not die until that evil Karma is exhausted <span
id="fr_254"></span>[2](#fn_250.md)."

'Give me a further illustration.'

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

'Now what do you think, O king? Do not the females of lions and tigers
and panthers and dogs eat hard bits of bone and flesh?'

'Yes, they eat such things.'

'What then? are such hard things, \[**68**\] when they have got into the
stomach, into the interior of the abdomen, destroyed?'

'Yes, they are destroyed?'

'And the embryo that may be inside the same animals,--is that too
destroyed?'

'Certainly not.'

'But why not?'

'I suppose, Sir, it escapes destruction by the influence of Karma.'

'Just so, great king, it is by the influence of Karma that beings in
purgatory, though they burn for thousands of years, are not destroyed.'

'Give me a further illustration.'

'Now what do you think, O king? Do not the tender women--wives of the
Yonakas, and nobles, and brahmins, and householders--eat hard cakes and
meat.

'Yes, they eat such hard things.'

'And when those hard things have got into the stomach, into the interior
of the abdomen, are not they destroyed?'

'Yes, they are.'

'But the children in their womb,--are they destroyed?'

'Certainly not.'

'And why not?'

'I suppose, Sir, they escape destruction by the influence of Karma?'

'Just so, great king, it is through the influence

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

of Karma that beings in purgatory, though they burn for thousands of
years, yet are they not destroyed, If they are reborn there, there do
they grow up, and there do they die. For this, O king, has been declared
by the Blessed One: "He does not die until that evil Karma is
exhausted."'

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

5\. The king said: 'Venerable Nâgasena, your people say that the world
rests on water, the water on air, the air on space <span
id="fr_255"></span>[1](#fn_251.md). This saying also I cannot believe.'

Then the Elder brought water in a regulation water-pot <span
id="fr_256"></span>[2](#fn_252.md), and convinced king Milinda, saying: 'As
this water is supported by the atmosphere, so is that water supported by
air.'

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

6\. The king said: 'Is cessation Nirvâna <span
id="fr_257"></span>[3](#fn_253.md)?

'Yes, your Majesty' \[**69**\].

'How is, that, Nâgasena?'

'All foolish individuals, O king, take pleasure in

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

the senses and in the objects of sense, find delight in them, continue
to cleave to them <span id="fr_258"></span>[1](#fn_254.md). Hence are they
carried down by that flood (of human passions), they are not set free
from birth, old age, and death, from grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow,
and despair,--they are not set free, I say, from suffering. But the
wise, O king, the disciple of the noble ones, neither takes pleasure in
those things, nor finds delight in them, nor continues cleaving to them.
And inasmuch as he does not, in him craving <span
id="fr_259"></span>[2](#fn_255.md) ceases, and by the cessation of craving
grasping <span id="fr_260"></span>[2](#fn_255.md) ceases, and by the
cessation of grasping becoming <span id="fr_261"></span>[2](#fn_255.md)
ceases, and when becoming has ceased birth ceases, and with its
cessation birth, old age, and death, grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow,
and despair cease to exist. Thus is the cessation brought about the end
of all that aggregation of pain. Thus is it that cessation is
Nirvâ*n*a.'

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

7\. The king said: 'Venerable Nâgasena, do all men receive Nirvâna?'

'Not all, O king. But he who walks righteously, who admits those
conditions which ought to be admitted, perceives clearly those
conditions which ought to be clearly perceived, abandons those
conditions which ought to be abandoned, practises himself in those
conditions which ought to be practised, realises those conditions which
ought to be realised--he receives Nirvâ*n*a.'

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

8\. The king said: 'Venerable Nâgasena, does he who does not receive
Nirvâ*n*a know how happy a state Nirvâ*n*a is <span
id="fr_262"></span>[1](#fn_256.md)?'

'Yes, he knows it.'

'But how can he know that without his receiving Nirvâ*n*a?'

'Now what do you think, O king? Do those whose hands and feet have not
been cut off know how sad a thing it is to have them cut off?'

'Yes, Sir, that they know.'

'But how do they know it?'

'Well, by hearing the sound of the lamentation of those whose hands and
feet have been cut off, they know it.'

\[**70**\] 'Just so, great king, it is by hearing the glad words of
those who have seen Nirvâ*n*a, that they who have not received it know
how happy a state it is.'

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

Here ends the Fourth Chapter.

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_241"></span>[100:1](sbe3508.htm#fr_245.md) The chapters go
straight on because Books II and III are really only parts of one Book.
See above, p. 4.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[100:2](sbe3508.htm#fr_246.md) The meaning here is
not easy to follow, as the word Âyatana is used either for the organs of
sense, or for the objects of sense; and there is nothing in the context
to show which is meant. Probably the idea is that good sight, hearing,
&c. in one birth are each the result of a separate Karma in the last
birth. But I am by no means sure of this, and the Si*m*halese (p. 76) is
just as ambiguous as the Pâli.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[101:1](sbe3508.htm#fr_247.md) Mr. Trenckner
points out that this quotation is from the Ma*ggh*ima, No. 135. The
doctrine is laid down frequently elsewhere also in the Pi*t*akas. See,
for instance, A<u>n</u>guttara IV, 97 (pp. 202-203 of Dr. Morris's
edition for the Pâli Text Society).

<span id="fn_244"></span>[101:2](sbe3508.htm#fr_248.md) Above, II, 1, 5, p.
50, and compare I, 38.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[101:3](sbe3508.htm#fr_249.md) These three
illustrations recur (nearly) below, III, 7, 3, pp. 125-126.

<span id="fn_246"></span>[103:1](sbe3508.htm#fr_250.md) *Gh*âyati. It is an
odd coincidence that this word, which means either to burn or to
meditate, according to the root from which it is derived, can be
rendered here either 'burn' or 'brood' in English. In fact it is the
second, not the first, root that is here intended, as is plain from such
passages as *G*âtaka III, 354, where the compound pa*ggh*âyati means 'to
brood over a thing.'

<span id="fn_247"></span>[103:2](sbe3508.htm#fr_251.md) Quoted from the
Sa*m*yutta Nikâya II, 3, 2 (p. 57 in M. Feer's edition, published by the
Pâli Text Society). The readings there differ slightly from those of our
text here, and the verses are put into the mouth of Khema, the god,
instead of being ascribed to the Buddha. Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p. 79) agrees
with M. Léon Feer in reading mando for mano in the last line; and I have
followed them in my translation. There are several stanzas in the
*G*âtaka book of carters lost in the desert, but there is nothing to
identify any one of them with the story referred to.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[103:3](sbe3508.htm#fr_252.md) 'You' in the
plural: that is, 'you Bhikkhus.' So also above, pp.
[30](sbe3503.htm#page_30), [50](sbe3504.htm#page_50.md).

<span id="fn_249"></span>[104:1](sbe3508.htm#fr_253.md) It may be noticed
that the particular feminine forms chosen are in each case unusual,
being in inî instead of the simple î. The first animal, the Makarinî, is
said by Childers to be a mythical animal, but it is clear from
Buddhaghosa on *K*ullavagga V, 1, 4, that an ordinary animal is meant,
and that is so I think here, though the translation 'shark' is
conjectural.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[104:2](sbe3508.htm#fr_254.md) From
A<u>n</u>guttara III, 35, 4 (p. 141 of Dr. Morris's edition for the Pâli
Text Society).

<span id="fn_251"></span>[106:1](sbe3508.htm#fr_255.md) This is not a
distinctively Buddhist belief. It was commonly held at the time by other
teachers. Compare 'Book of the Great Decease,' III, 13 (in 'Buddhist
Suttas,' Sacred Books of the East, vol. xi, p. 45).

<span id="fn_252"></span>[106:2](sbe3508.htm#fr_256.md) Dhamma-karakena.
The passages show that this was a pot so made, that no water could pass
from it except through a filtering medium. When not being actually used
the water was no doubt kept at a certain height in it by the pressure of
the atmosphere. I do not know of any specimen preserved in our modern
museums or figured on ancient bas-reliefs, and the exact shape is
unknown. It must be different from the one represented in plate xlviii
of Cunningham's 'Bhilsa Tope.' See *K*ullavagga V, 13, 1 (note); VI, 21,
3; XII, 2, 1; Mahâva*m*sa, p. 60.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[106:3](sbe3508.htm#fr_257.md) Nirodho nibbânan
ti.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[107:1](sbe3508.htm#fr_258.md) A*ggh*osâya
ti*tth*anti. Compare A<u>n</u>guttara II, 4, 6, and Theri Gâthâ, 794.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[107:2](sbe3508.htm#fr_261.md) Ta*n*hâ, Upâdâna,
Bhava.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[108:1](sbe3508.htm#fr_262.md) The opposite point
(whether he who has Nirvâ*n*a, knows that he has it) is discussed above,
II, 2.
