# INTRODUCTION.

THE work of which a translation is here, for the first time, presented
to the English reading public, has had a strange and interesting
history. Written in Northern India, at or a little after the beginning
of the Christian era, and either in Sanskrit itself or in some North
Indian Prakrit, it has been entirely lost in the land of its origin, and
(so far as is at present known) is not extant in any of the homes of the
various sects and schools of the Buddhists, except only in Ceylon, and
in those countries which have derived their Buddhism from Ceylon. It is
true that General Cunningham says <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) that
the name of Milinda, 'is still famous in all Buddhist countries.' But he
is here drawing a very wide conclusion from an isolated fact. For in his
note he refers only to Hardy, who is good evidence for Ceylon, but who
does not even say that the 'Milinda' was known elsewhere.

Preserved there, and translated at a very early date into Pâli, it has
become, in its southern home, a book of standard authority, is put into
the hands of those who have begun to doubt the cardinal points of
Buddhist doctrine, has been long a popular work in its Pâli form, has
been translated into Si*m*halese, and occupies a unique position, second
only to the Pâli Pi*t*akas (and perhaps also to the celebrated work of
Buddhaghosa, the 'Path of Purity'). From Ceylon it has been transferred,
in its Pâli form, to both Burma and Siam, and in those countries also it
enjoys so high a repute, that it has been commented on (if not
translated). It is not merely the only work composed among the Northern
Buddhists which is regarded with reverence by the orthodox Buddhists of
the southern

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

schools; it is the only one which has survived at all amongst them. And
it is the only prose work composed in ancient India which would be
considered, from the modern point of view, as a successful work of art.

The external evidence for these statements is, at present, both very
slight and, for the most part, late. There appeared at Colombo in the
year of Buddha 2420 (1877 A.D.) a volume of 650 pages, large 8vo.--the
most considerable in point of size as yet issued from the Si*m*halese
press--entitled MILINDA PRA*SN*AYA. It was published at the expense of
five Buddhist gentlemen whose names deserve to be here recorded. They
are Karolis Pîris, Abraham Liwerâ, Luis Mendis, Nandis Mendis
Amara-sekara, and Chârlis Arnolis Mendis Wijaya-ratna Amara-sekara. It
is stated in the preface that the account of the celebrated discussion
held between Milinda and Nâgasena, about 500 years after the death of
the Buddha, was translated into the Mâgadhî language by 'teachers of
old' (purwâ*k*ârin wisin);--that that Pâli version was translated into
Si*m*halese, at the instance and under the patronage of King Kîrtti Srî
Râga-si*m*ha, who came to the throne of Ceylon in the year of Buddha
2290 (1747 A. D.), by a member of the Buddhist Order named
Hîna*t*i-kumburê Suma<u>n</u>gala, a lineal successor, in the line of
teacher and pupil (anu*s*ishya), of the celebrated Wœliwi*t*a
Sara*n*a<u>n</u>kara, who had been appointed Sa*m*gha-râ*g*a, or chief
of the Order--that 'this priceless book, unsurpassable as a means either
for learning the Buddhist doctrine, or for growth in the knowledge of
it, or for the suppression of erroneous opinions,' had become corrupt by
frequent copying--that, at the instigation of the well-known scholar
Moho*tt*i-watte Gunânanda, these five had had the texts corrected and
restored by several learned Bhikkhus (kîpa namak lawâ), and had had
indices and a glossary added, and now published the thus revised and
improved edition.

The Si*m*halese translation, thus introduced to us, follows the Pâli
throughout, except that it here and there adds, in the way of gloss,
extracts from one or other of the numerous Pi*t*aka texts referred to,
and also that it starts with a prophecy,

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

put into the mouth of the Buddha when on his death-bed, that this
discussion would take place about 500 years after his death, and that it
inserts further, at the point indicated in my note on [p.
3](sbe3503.htm#page_3.md) of the present version, an account of how the
Si*m*halese translator came to write his version. His own account of the
matter adds to the details given above that he wrote the work at the
Uposatha Ârâma of the Mahâ Wihâra near *S*rî-ward-hana-pura, 'a place
famous for the possession of a temple containing the celebrated Tooth
Relic, and a monastery which had been the residence of Wœliwi*t*a
Sara*n*a<u>n</u>kara, the Sa*m*gha-râga, and of the famous scholars and
commentators Darami*t*i-pola Dhamma-rakkhita and Madhurasato*t*a
Dhammakkhandha.'

As Kîrtti *S*rî Râga-si*m*ha reigned till 1781 <span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md), this would only prove that our Pâli work
was extant in Ceylon in its present form, and there regarded as of great
antiquity and high authority, towards the close of the last century. And
no other mention of the work has, as yet, been discovered in any older
Si*m*halese author. But in the present deplorable state of our ignorance
of the varied and ancient literature of Ceylon, the argument ex silentio
would be simply of no value. Now that the Ceylon Government have
introduced into the Legislative Council a bill for the utilisation, in
the interests of education, of the endowments of the Buddhist
monasteries, it may be hoped that the value of the books written in
those monasteries will not be forgotten, and that a sufficient yearly
sum will be put aside for the editing and publication of a literature of
such great historical value <span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md). At
present we can only deplore the impossibility of tracing the history of
the 'Questions of Milinda' in other works written by the scholarly
natives of its southern home.

That it will be mentioned in those works there can be

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

but little doubt. For the great Indian writer, who long ago found in
that beautiful and peaceful island the best scope for his industrious
scholarship, is already known to have: mentioned the book no less than
four times in his commentaries; and that in such a manner that we may
fairly hope to find other references to it when his writings shall. have
been more completely published. In his commentary on the Book of the
Great Decease, VI, 3, Buddhaghosa refers to the quotation of that
passage made in the conversation between Milinda and Nâgasena,
translated below, at IV, 2, 1 <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md). And
again, in his commentary on the Amba*tth*a Sutta (D. III, 2, 12) he
quotes the words of a conversation between Milinda and Nâgasena on the
subject he is there discussing. The actual words he uses (they will be
found at pp. 275, 276 of the edition of the Suma*n*gala Vilâsîni, edited
for the Pâli Text Society by Professor Carpenter and myself) are not the
same as those of our author at the corresponding passage of Mr.
Trenckner's text (pp. 168, 169; IV, 3, 11), but they are the same in
substance.

The above two references in Buddhaghosa to our author were pointed out
by myself. Dr. Morris has pointed out two others, and in each of those
also Buddhaghosa is found to quote words differing from Mr. Trenckner's
text. The former of these two was mentioned in a letter to the 'Academy'
of the 12th November, 1881. In the Manoratha Pûra*n*î, his commentary on
the A*n*guttara, on the passage marked in Dr. Morris's edition as L 5,
8, Buddhaghosa says:--

'Imasmi*m* pan' atthe Milinda-râgâ dhamma-kathika-Nâgasenatthera*m*
pu*kkh*i: "Bhante Nâgasena, ekasmim a*kkh*arakkha*n*e
pavattita-*k*itta-sa*m*khârâ sa*k*e rûpino assa kîva mahâ-râsi
bhavey-yâti?"'

And he then gives the answer:--'Vâhasatâna*m* kho mahâ-râ*g*a vihîna*m*
a*ddh*a-*k*ûla*ñ* *k*a vâhâ vîhi sattammanâni dve *k*a tumbâ
eka*kkh*arakkha*n*e

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

pavattitassa *k*ittassa sa<u>n</u>kham pi na upenti kalam pi na upenti
kala-bhâgam pi na upentîti.'

This passage of the Milinda, referred to by Buddhaghosa, will be found
on p. 102 of Mr. Trenckner's edition, translated below at IV, 1, 19. But
the question is not found there at all, and the answer, though much the
same in the published text, still differs in the concluding words. Mr.
Trenckner marks the passage in his text as corrupt, and it may well be
that Buddhaghosa has preserved for us an older and better reading.

The other passage quoted by Dr. Morris (in the 'Academy' of the 11th
January, 1881) is from the Papa*ñk*a Sûdanî, Buddhaghosa's still
unedited Commentary on the Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya. It is in the comment on
the Brahmâyu Suttanta, and as it is not accessible elsewhere I give this
passage also in full herb. With reference, oddly enough, to the same
passage referred to above (pp. 168, 169 of the text, translated below at
IV, 3, 11) Buddhaghosa, there says:--

'Vutta*m* eta*m* Nâgasenattherena Milinda-ra*ññ*a pu*tth*ena: "Na
mahârâ*g*a Bhagavâ guyha*m* dasseti *kh*âya*m* Bhagavâ dassetîti."'

In this case, as in the other quotation of the same passage, the words
quoted are not quite the same as those given in the published text, and
on the other hand they agree with, though they are much shorter than,
the words as given in the Sumangala Vilâsinî.

It would be premature to attempt to arrive at the reason of this
difference between Buddhaghosa's citations and Mr. Trenckner's edition
of the text. It may be that Buddhaghosa is consciously summarising, or
that he is quoting roughly from memory, or that he is himself
translating or summarising from the original work, or that he is quoting
from another Pâli version, or that he is quoting from another recension
of the text of the existing Pâli version. We must have the full text of
all his references to the 'Questions of Milinda' before us, before we
try to choose between these, and possibly other, alternative
explanations. What is at present certain is that when

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Buddhaghosa wrote his great works, that is about
430 A.D., he had before him a book giving the conversations between
Milinda and Nâgasena. And more than that. He introduces his comment
above referred to on the Amba*tth*a Sutta by saying, after simply
quoting the words of the text he is explaining: 'What would be the use
of any one else saying anything on this? For Nâgasena, the Elder,
himself said as follows in reply to Milinda, the king <span
id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md)'--and he then quotes Nâgasena, and adds not
a word of his own. It follows that the greatest of all Buddhist writers
known to us by name regarded the 'Questions of Milinda' as a work of so
great authority that an opinion put by its author into the mouth of
Nâgasena should be taken as decisive. And this is not only the only
book, outside the Pâli Pi*t*akas, which Buddhaghosa defers to in this
way, it is the only book, except the previous commentaries, which he is
known even to refer to at all. But, on the other hand, he says nothing
in these passages to throw any further light on the date, or any light
on the authorship, of the work to which he assigns so distinguished,
even so unique, a position.

So far as to what is known about our 'Questions of Milinda' in Ceylon.
The work also exists, certainly in Pâli, and probably in translations
into the local dialects, in Burma and Siam. For Mr. Trenckner mentions
(Introduction, p. iv) a copy in the Burmese character of the Pâli text
sent to him by Dr. Rost, there is another copy in that character in the
Colombo Museum <span id="fr_5"></span>[2](#fn_5.md), and Mr. J. G. Scott,
of the Burmese Civil Service, has sent to England a Burmese Nissaya of
the Milinda, (a kind of translation, giving the Pâli text, word for
word, followed by the interpretation of those words in Burmese <span
id="fr_6"></span>[3](#fn_6).md). A manuscript of the Pâli text, brought
from Siam, is referred to in the Si*m*halese MSS. in the marginal note
quoted by Mr. Trenckner at p. vi of the

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Introduction to his edition. And there exists in
the library of Trinity College, Cambridge, a complete MS., in excellent
condition, in the Siamese-Pâli character <span
id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md), while there are numerous fragments in the
Paris Bibliothèque Nationale of one or more MSS. of the text, in the
same Kambojan character used in Siam for the writing of Pâli texts <span
id="fr_8"></span>[2](#fn_8.md).

It may be noticed here that there are seven MSS. of the text written in
the Ceylon character known to exist in Europe. Two of them (one a very
ancient one) are in the Copenhagen University Library, two in the
Bibliothèque Nationale <span id="fr_9"></span>[2](#fn_8.md), one in the
Cambridge University Library <span id="fr_10"></span>[3](#fn_9.md), and two
in the India Office Library <span id="fr_11"></span>[4](#fn_10.md). Three
only of these seven have been used by Mr. Trenckner for his very able
and accurate edition of the text, published in 1880.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

That is all the external evidence at present available. What can be
inferred from the book itself is about as follows. It consists of the
discussion of a number of points of Buddhist doctrine treated in the
form of conversations between King Milinda and Nâgasena the Elder
(Thera). It must be plain to every reader of the following pages that
these are not real conversations. What we have before us is really an
historical romance, though the didactic aim overshadows the story. Men
of straw, often very skilfully put together, are set up for the purpose,
not so much of knocking them down again, as of elucidating some points
of ethical or psychological belief while doing so. The king himself
plays a very subordinate part. The questions raised, or dilemmas stated,
are put into his mouth. But the solutions, to give opportunity for which
the questions or dilemmas are invented, are the really important part of
the work, and these are put into the mouth of Nâgasena. The dialogues
are introduced by a carefully constructed

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

preliminary story, in which the reader's interest in them is aroused by
anticipation. And the ability of this part of the work is very great.
For in spite of the facts that all the praise lavished therein upon both
Milinda and Nâgasena is in reality only praise of the book itself, and
that the reader knows this very well, yet he will find it almost
impossible to escape from the influence of the eloquent words in which
importance and dignity are lent to the occasion of their meeting; and of
the charm and skill with which the whole fiction is maintained.

The question then arises whether the personages were any more real than
the conversations. Milinda is supposed to be the Menander, who appears
in the list of the Greek kings of Baktria, since he is described in the
book as being a king of the Yonakas reigning at Sâgala (the Euthydemia
of the Greeks), and there is no other name in the list which comes so
near to Milinda. This identification of the two names is certainly
correct. For whether it was our author who deliberately made the change
in adapting the Greek name to the Indian dialect in which he wrote, or
whether the change is due to a natural phonetic decay, the same causes
will have been of influence. Indra or Inda is a not uncommon termination
of Indian names, and meaning king is so appropriate to a king, that a
foreign king's name ending in -ander would almost inevitably come to end
in -inda. Then the sequence of the liquids of m-n-n would tend in an
Indian dialect to be altered in some way by dissimilation, and Mr.
Trenckner adduces seven instances in Pâli of l taking the place of n, or
n of l, in similar circumstances <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_11.md).

There remains only the change of the first E in Menander to I. Now in
the Indian part of the inscription, on undoubted coins of Menander, the
oldest authorities read Minanda as the king's name <span
id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_12.md), and though that interpretation has now,
on the authority of better specimens, been given up, there is no doubt
that Milinda runs more easily

<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span>

from the tongue than Melinda, and Mil may well have seemed as
appropriate a commencement for a Milakkha's name as -inda is for the
ending of a king's name. So Men-ander became Mil-inda.

It may be added here that other Greek names are mentioned by our
author--Devamantiya at I, 42, and the same officer, together with
Anantakâya, Mankura, and Sabbadinna, at II, 3. There is a similar effort
in these other Pâli forms of Greek words to make them give some approach
to a meaning in the Indian dialect: but in each case the new forms
remain as really unintelligible to an Indian as Mil-inda would be. Thus
Deva-mantiya, which may be formed on Demetrios, looks, at first sight,
Indian enough. But if it meant anything, it could only mean 'counsellor
of the gods.' And so also both Ananta and Kâya are Indian words. But the
compound Ananta-kâya would mean 'having an infinite body,' which is
absurd as the name of a courtier. It may possibly be made up to
represent Antiochos. What Mankura and Sabbadinna (called simply Dinna at
[p. 87](sbe3506.htm#page_87).md) may be supposed to be intended for it is
difficult to say <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_13.md). But the
identification of Milinda with Menander is as certain as that of
*K*andagutta with Sandrokottos.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Very little is told us, in the Greek or Roman writers, about any of the
Greek kings of Baktria. It is a significant fact that it is precisely of
Menander-Milinda that they tell us most, though this most is
unfortunately not much.

Strabo, in his Geography <span id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_14.md), mentions
Menander as one of the two Baktrian kings who were instrumental in
spreading the Greek dominion furthest to the East into India. He crossed
the Hypanis (that is the Sutlej) and penetrated as far as the Isamos
(probably the Jumna).

Then in the title of the lost forty-first book of Justin's work,
Menander and Apollodotus are mentioned as 'Indian kings.'

Finally, Plutarch <span id="fr_16"></span>[3](#fn_15.md) tells us an
anecdote of Menander.

<span id="page_xx">p. xx</span>

\[paragraph continues\] He was, he says, as a ruler noted for justice,
and enjoyed such popularity with his subjects, that upon his death,
which took place in camp, diverse cities contended for the possession of
his ashes. The dispute was only adjusted by the representatives of the
cities agreeing that the relics should be divided amongst them, and that
they should severally erect monuments (μνημεῖα, no doubt dâgabas or
sthûpas) to his memory.

This last statement is very curious as being precisely analogous to the
statement in the 'Book of the Great Decease <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_16.md),' as to what occurred after the death of
the Buddha himself. But it would be very hazardous to draw any
conclusion from this coincidence.

The only remaining ancient evidence about Menander-Milinda (apart from
what is said by our author himself), is that of coins. And, as is
usually the case, the evidence of the coins will be found to confirm,
but to add very little to, what is otherwise known.

As many as twenty-two <span id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_17.md) different
coins have been discovered, some of them in very considerable numbers,
bearing the name, and eight of them the effigy, of Menander. They have
been found over a very wide extent of country, as far west as Kâbul, as
far east as Mathurâ, and one of them as far north as Kashmir. Curiously
enough we find a confirmation of this wide currency of
Menander-Milinda's coins in the work of the anonymous author of the
'Periplus Maris Erythræi.' He says <span id="fr_19"></span>[3](#fn_18.md)
that Menander's coins, together with those of Apollodotos, were current,
many years after his death, at Barygaza, the modern Baroach, on the
coast of Gujarat.

The portrait on the coins is very characteristic, with a long face and
an intelligent expression, and is sometimes that of a young man, and at
other times that of a very old man. It may be inferred therefore that
his reign

<span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span>

was as long as his power was extensive. All the coins have a legend in
Greek letters on one side, and a corresponding legend in Ariano-pâli
letters on the other side. On twenty-one out of the twenty-two, the
inscriptions, according to the latest interpretations from a comparison
of the best examples, are respectively,

 

BASILEÔS SÔTÊROS MENANDROU

and

MAHARA*G*ASA TRADATASA MENANDRASA <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_19.md).

 

Wilson read <span id="fr_21"></span>[2](#fn_20.md) the last word Minadasa.
But when he wrote, in 1840, the alphabet was neither so well known as it
is now, nor had such good examples come to hand. So that though the Mi-
is plain enough on several coins, it is almost certainly a mere mistake
for Me, from which it only differs by the centre vowel stroke being
slightly prolonged.

Fifteen of the coins have a figure of Pallas either on one side or the
other. A 'victory,' a horse jumping, a dolphin, a head (perhaps of a
god), a two-humped camel, an elephant goad, a boar, a wheel, and a palm
branch are each found on one side or the other of one of the coins; and
an elephant, an owl, and a bull's head each occur twice. These are all
the emblems or figures on the coins. None of them are distinctively
Buddhist, though the wheel might be claimed as the Buddhist wheel, and
the palm branch and the elephant would be quite in place on Buddhist
coins. It may be said, therefore, that the bulk of the coins are clearly
pagan, and not Buddhist; and that though two or three are doubtful, even
they are probably not Buddhist,

One coin, however, a very rare one, differs, as to its inscription, from
all the rest that have the legend. It has on one side

 

BASILEÔS DIKATOU MENANDROU,

 

and on the other,

 

MAHARA*G*ASA DHARMIKASA <span id="fr_22"></span>[3](#fn_21.md) MENANDRASA.

 

<span id="page_xxii">p. xxii</span>

Is any reference intended here to the Buddhist Dharma as distinct from
the ordinary righteousness of kings? I think not. The coin is one of
those with the figure of Pallas on the side which bears the Greek
legend, and five others of the Baktrian Greek kings use a similar legend
on their coins. These are Agathocles, Heliokles, Archebios, Strato, and
Zoilos. There is also another coin in the series with a legend into
which the word Dharma enters, but which has not yet been deciphered with
certainty--that bearing in the Greek legend the name of Sy-Hermaios, and
supposed to have been struck by Kadphises I. If there is anything
Buddhist in this coin of Menander's, then the others also must be
Buddhist. But it is much simpler to take the word dharmikasa in the
sense of the word used in the corresponding Greek legend, and to
translate it simply 'the Righteous,' or, better still, 'the Just.' Only
when we call to mind how frequent in the Pâli texts is the description
of the ideal king (whether Buddhist or not) as dhammiko dhamma-râ*g*a,
we cannot refuse to see the connection between this phrase and the
legend of the coins, and to note how at least six of the Greek kings,
one of whom is Menander, are sufficiently desirous to meet the views of
their Buddhist subjects to fix upon 'Righteousness' or 'Justice' as the
characteristic by which they wish to be known. The use of this epithet
is very probably the foundation of the tradition preserved by Plutarch,
that Menander was, as a ruler, noted for justice; and it is certainly
evidence of the Buddhist influences by which he was surrounded. But it
is no evidence at all that he actually became a Buddhist.

To sum up.--Menander-Milinda was one of those Greek kings who carried on
in Baktria the Greek dominion founded by Alexander the Great. He was
certainly one of the most important, probably the most important, of
those kings. He carried the Greek arms further into India than any of
his predecessors had done, and everything confirms the view given by our
author at I, 9 of his justice and his power, of his ability and his
wealth. He must have reigned for a considerable time in the latter

<span id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span>

part of the second century B.C., probably from about 140 to about 115,
or even 110 B.C. <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) His fame extended,
as did that of no other Baktrian king, to the West, and he is the only
Baktrian Greek king who has been remembered in India. Our author makes
him say, incidentally <span id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_23.md), that he was
born at Kalasi in Alasanda (= Alexandria), a name given to an island
presumably in the Indus. And, as was referred to above, Plutarch has
preserved the tradition that he died in camp, in a campaign against the
Indians in the valley of the Ganges.

\[It is interesting to point out, in this connection, that the town
(gâma) of Kalasi has not been found mentioned elsewhere. Now among the
very numerous coins of the Baktrian kings there is one, and only one,
giving in the legend, not the name of a king, but the name of a city,
the city of Karisi. As this coin was struck about 180 B.C. by
Eukratides, who was probably the first of these kings to obtain a
settlement on the banks of the Indus, it is possible that the two names,
one in the Pâli form (or more probably in the form of the dialect used
by our author), the other in the local form, are identical; and that the
coin was struck in commemoration of the fact of the Greeks having
reached the Indus. If that be so, then that they gave the name Alasanda
(Alexandria) to the island on which the town was built, and not to the
town itself, seems to show that the town was not founded by them, but
was already an important place when they took it.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Beyond this all is conjecture. When our author says that Milinda, was
converted to Buddhism <span id="fr_25"></span>[3](#fn_24.md), he may be
either relating an actual tradition, or he may be inventing for his own
purposes. There is nothing inherently impossible, or even improbable, in
the story. We know that all the Baktrians, kings and people alike,
eventually became

<span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Buddhist. But the passage occurs in a part of
the book which is open to much doubt. We have to place against it the
negative evidence that none of Menander's coins show any decisive signs
of his conversion. And the passage in question goes much further. It
says that he afterwards gave up the kingdom to his son, and having
entered the Buddhist Order, attained to Arahatship. The Si*m*halese MSS.
add a marginal note to the effect that the whole of this passage with
its context was derived from a MS. brought from Siam. Mr. Trenckner is
therefore of opinion <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_25.md) that it belongs
to a spurious supplement. That may be so, in spite of the fact that it
is quite in our author's style, and forms an appropriate close to the
book. But it is incredible that an author of the literary skill so
evident throughout the work should have closed his book deliberately in
the middle of a paragraph, without any closing words to round it off.
The Siamese MS. may after all have preserved the reading of older and
better MSS. than those in Ceylon, and the last leaf of the book may have
been lost there. There must have been some conclusion, if not in the
manner of the paragraph under discussion, then in some other words which
we may not be able to trace. But even if our author actually wrote that
Menander did become a Bhikkhu and an Arahat, that is very poor evidence
of the fact, unless he not only intended what he states to be taken
quite literally, but also wrote soon after the events he thus
deliberately records.

Now the opinion has been expressed above that we have to deal with a
book of didactic ethics and religious controversy cast into the form of
historical romance. If this is correct no one would be more astonished
than the author himself at the inconsistency of modern critics if they
took his historical statements au grand serieux, while they made light
of his ethical arguments. It is true that he would scarcely have been
guilty of anything that seemed grossly improbable, at the time when he
wrote, to the readers whom he addressed. But if, as is most probable, he
wrote in North-Western

<span id="page_xxv">p. xxv</span>

\[paragraph continues\] India when the memory of the actual facts of
Menander's reign was fading away--that is, some generations after his
death--he may well have converted him to Buddhism, as the most fitting
close to the discussion he records, without intending at all to convey
thereby any real historical event.

This brings us to the next point of our argument.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

We have seen that the work must have been written some considerable time
before Buddhaghosa, and after the death of Menander. Can its date be
determined with greater accuracy than this? The story of Nâgasena
introduces to us his father So*n*uttara, his teachers Roha*n*a,
Assagutta of the Vattaniya hermitage, and Dhamma-rakkhita of the Asoka
Ârâma near Pâ*t*aliputta, and there is also mention of a teacher named
Âyupâla dwelling at the Sa<u>n</u>kheyya hermitage near Sâgala. None of
these persons and none of these places are read of elsewhere in any
Buddhist text, whether Sanskrit or Pâli. For the A*s*vagupta referred to
in passing at p. 351 of the Divyâvadâna has nothing in common (except
the name) with our Assagutta, the Roha*n*a of A<u>n</u>guttara, III, 66,
is quite distinct from our Roha*n*a, and there is not the slightest
reason for supposing Nâgasena to be another form of the name
Nâgâr*g*u*n*a, found in both the Chinese and Tibetan Buddhist
literatures <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_26.md), and in the Jain
lists <span id="fr_28"></span>[2](#fn_27.md). The famous Buddhist scholar
so called was the reputed founder of the Mahâyâna school of Buddhism.
Our Nâgasena represents throughout the older teaching. If there is any
connection at all between the two names, Nâgasena must have been
invented as a contrast to Nâgâr*g*u*n*a, and not with the least idea of
identifying two men whose doctrines are so radically opposed. Even were
there any reason to believe this to be the case, it would not help us
much, for the date

<span id="page_xxvi">p. xxvi</span>

of Nâgâr*g*u*n*a is quite as much open to dispute as that of the author
of the 'Questions of Milinda <span id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_28.md).'

I ought to mention here that an opinion of a Nâgasena is, according to
Burnouf <span id="fr_30"></span>[2](#fn_29.md), discussed at length in the
Abhidharma Ko*s*a Vyâkhyâ; and that Schiefner <span
id="fr_31"></span>[3](#fn_30.md) quotes from a Tibetan work, the Bu-ston,
the statement that a schism took place under a Thera Nâgasena 137 years
after the Buddha's death. It would be very interesting if the former
were our Nâgasena. And if Schiefner's restoration of the name found in
his Tibetan authority be correct, and the authority itself be
trustworthy, it is possibly the fading memory of that Nâgasena which
induced our author to adopt the name as that of the principal
interlocutor in his 'Questions of Milinda.'

Finally, Professor Kern, of Leiden--who believes that Buddha is the sun,
and most of his principal disciples stars--believes also not only that
our Nâgasena is an historical person, but also that there never was a
Buddhist cleric of that name; and that Nâgasena is simply Pata*ñg*ali,
the author of the Yoga philosophy, under another name. If this is not a
joke, it is a strange piece of credulity.

The only reason alleged in support of it is that Pata*ñg*ali has the
epithets of Nâge*s*a and of Pha*n*in. That he was a Hindu who believed
in the soul-theory of the current animistic creed, while all the
opinions put into Nâgasena's mouth are those of a thorough-going
Buddhist and non-individualist, is to count as nothing against this
chance similarity, not of names, but of the name on one side with an
epithet on the other. To identify John Stuart Mill with Dean Milman
would be sober sense compared with this proposal.

<span id="page_xxvii">p. xxvii</span>

\[paragraph continues\] But it is deliberately put forward to support an
accusation against the Buddhists of having falsely appropriated to
themselves every famous man in India <span
id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_31.md). Any mud, it would seem, is good enough to
pelt the Buddhists with. Yet who is it, after all, who really makes the
'appropriation,' the Buddhists or Professor Kern himself?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It would seem, therefore, that most of our author's person and place
names are probably inventions of his own <span
id="fr_33"></span>[2](#fn_32.md).

But it is quite different with the books quoted by our author. In
several passages he has evidently in his mind certain Pâli texts which
deal with similar matters. So far as yet ascertained the texts thus
silently referred to, either in. the present volume or in the subsequent
untranslated portion of the book, are as follows:

Lastly, our author quotes a large number of passages from the Pi*t*aka
texts, which he introduces (without naming any book) by the formulas:
'It was said by the Blessed One;' or, 'It is said by you' (you in the
plural, you members of the Order); or, 'It was said by so and so'
(naming some particular member of the Order). A great many of these
quotations have already been traced, either by Mr. Trenckner or myself.
Occasionally words thus attributed, by our author, to the Buddha, are,
in the Pi*t*akas, attributed to some one else. Such passages are
distinguished in the following list by an asterisk added to the letter
B, which marks those of them attributed by our author to the Buddha. The
women quoted are distinguished by the title 'Sister.'

This shows the total extent of the three Pi*t*akas to be about 10,000
pages 8vo. as printed, or to be printed, by the Pâli Text Society <span
id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_35.md). If our English Bible, in the older
authorised version, were to be printed in the same manner and type and
on the same size of page, it would occupy about 5,000 pages. So that the
Buddhist Bible without its repetitions (some of which are very frequent,
and others very long), would only occupy about double the space of the
English Bible. This would not have been a literature too large to be
familiarly known to our author. What is the conclusion which can fairly
be drawn, from a comparison of the last list with those preceding it, as
to his knowledge of those books now held, by living Buddhists, to be
canonical?

The answer to this question will be of some importance for another
reason beyond the help it will afford towards settling the date of the:
original 'Questions of Milinda.' As is well known, Asoka, in the only
one of his edicts, addressed specially to the members of the Buddhist
Order of mendicants, selects seven portions of the Buddhist Scriptures,
which he mentions by name, and expresses his desire that not only the
brethren and sisters of the Order, but also the laity, should constantly
learn by heart and reflect upon those seven. Now not one of the seven
titles which occur in the edict is identical with any of the twenty-nine
in the last list. Whereupon certain Indianists have rejoiced at being
able to score a point, as they think, against these

<span id="page_xxxviii">p. xxxviii</span>

unbrahmanical Buddhists, and have jumped to the conclusion that the
Buddhist canon must be late and spurious; and that the Buddhism of
Asoka's time must have been very different from the Buddhism of the Pâli
Pi*t*akas. That would be much the same as if a Japanese scholar, at a
time when he knew little or nothing of Christianity, except the names of
the books in the Bible, were to have found an open letter of
Constantine's in which he urges both the clergy and laity to look upon
the Word of God as their only authority, and to constantly repeat and
earnestly meditate upon the Psalm of the Shepherd, the words of Lemuel,
the Prophecy of the Servant of the Lord, the Sermon on the Mount, the
Exaltation of Charity, the Question of Nicodemus, and the story of the
Prodigal Son--and that our Oriental critic should jump to the conclusion
that the canonical books of the Christians could not have been known in
the time of Constantine, and that the Christianity of Constantine was
really quite different from, and much more simple than the Christianity
of the Bible. As a matter of fact the existence of such a letter would
prove very little, either way, as to the date of the books in the Bible
as we now have them. If our Japanese scholar were to discover afterwards
a Christian work, even much later than the time of Constantine, in which
the canonical books of the Christians were both quoted and referred to,
he would have much surer ground for a sounder historical criticism. And
he would possibly come to see that the seven portions selected for
special honour and commendation were not intended as an exhaustive list
even of remarkable passages, much less for an exhaustive list of
canonical books, but that the number seven was merely chosen in
deference to the sacred character attaching to that number in the sacred
literature.

Such a book is our Milinda. It is, as we have seen, later than the
canonical books of the Pâli Pi*t*akas, and on the other hand, not only
older than the great commentaries, but the only book, outside the canon,
regarded in them as an authority which may be implicitly followed. And I
venture to think that the most simple working hypothesis

<span id="page_xxxix">p. xxxix</span>

by which to explain the numerous and varied references and quotations it
makes, as shown in the preceding lists, from the Pi*t*akas as a whole,
and from the various books contained in them, is that the Pâli Pi*t*akas
were known, in their entirety, and very nearly, if not quite, as we now
have them, to our author. For out of the twenty-nine books of the
Pi*t*akas, we find in the lists of works referred to by him the three
Pi*t*akas as a whole, the Vinaya Pi*t*aka as a whole, and all of its
component books except the Parivâra (which was composed in Ceylon), the
Sutta Pi*t*aka and each of the four great Nikâyas, the Abhidhamma
Pi*t*aka and each of its seven component books, and the Khuddaka Nikâya
as a whole and several of its separate books. And when we further
recollect the very large number of quotations appearing in my lists as
not yet traced in the Pi*t*akas, we see the necessity of being very
chary in drawing any argument ex silentio with respect to those books
not occurring in the lists.

To sum up.--It may be said generally that while the Sutta
Vibha<u>n</u>ga and the Khandhakas, the four great Nikâyas, and the
Abhidhamma were certainly known to our author, he very likely had no
knowledge of the Parivâra; and it remains to be seen how far his
knowledge of the Khuddaka Nikâya, which he happens to mention once <span
id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_36.md) as a whole by name, did actually extend.
At present it is only clear that he knew the Khuddaka Pâ*th*a, the
Dhammapada collection of sacred verses, the Sutta Nipâta, the Thera and
Theri-gâthâ, the *G*âtakas, and the Kariyâ Pi*t*aka. I hope to return to
this question in the Introduction to my second volume, only pointing out
here that the doubtful books (those concerning which our author is
apparently silent) would occupy about two thousand pages octavo, out of
the ten thousand of which the three Pi*t*akas would, if printed,
consist: and that those two thousand pages belong, for the most part,
precisely to that part of the Pi*t*akas which have not yet been edited,
so that there they may very likely, after all, be quoted in one or other

<span id="page_xl">p. xl</span>

of the numerous quotations entered as 'not traced' in my lists <span
id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_37.md).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Such being the extent, so far as can at present be shown, of our
author's knowledge of the three Pi*t*akas, the question arises as to the
degree and accuracy of his knowledge. In the great majority of cases his
quotations or references entirely agree with the readings shown by our
texts. But there are a few exceptions. And as these are both interesting
and instructive, it will be advisable to point them out in detail.

The reference to the Avî*k*i Hell as being outside the earth, if not at
variance with, is at least an addition to the teaching of the Pi*t*akas
as to cosmogony <span id="fr_39"></span>[2](#fn_38.md). But there is some
reason to believe that the passage may be an interpolation, and the
difference itself is not only doubtful but also of no particular
importance.

The description of the contents of the Puggala Pa*ññ*atti given in I,
26, does not really agree with the text. The book, in its first section,
sets out six different sorts of discrimination or distinction. One
paragraph only is devoted to each of the first five discriminations, and
the author or authors then proceed, in the rest of the book, to deal
with the details of the last of the six. Our author gives the six as the
divisions of the book itself.

But I think it is clear that so far as the description is inaccurate,
the error is due, not to any difference between the text as he had it
and that which we now possess, but simply to our author laying too great
a stress upon the opening paragraphs of the book.

In the reference to the Buddha's first sermon, the Foundation of the
Kingdom of Righteousness (in 1, 38), our author says that 'eighteen
ko*t*is of Brahma gods, and an innumerable company of other gods,
attained to comprehension

<span id="page_xli">p. xli</span>

of the truth.' There is no statement of the kind in the Pi*t*aka account
of this event (see my translation in 'Buddhist Suttas,' pp. 146-155).
But it is not inconsistent with the Pâli, and is doubtless added from
some edifying commentary.

There is a difference of reading between the lines put into Sâriputta's
mouth, at II, 2, 4, and those ascribed to Sâriputta in the Thera Gâthâ
(1002, 1003). If the Milinda reading is not found in some hitherto
unpublished passage, we have here a real case of divergence.

Perhaps the most important apparent variation between our author and the
Pi*t*aka texts is the statement put by him, in IV, 4, 9, into the mouth
of the Buddha, that a deliberate lie is one of the offences called
Pârâ*g*ika, that is, involving exclusion from the Order. Now in the old
Canon Law there are only four Pârâ*g*ika offences--breach of chastity,
theft, murder, and a false claim to extraordinary spiritual powers (see
my translation in vol. i, pp. 1-5 of the 'Vinaya Texts'); and falsehood
is placed quite distinctly under another category, that of the
Pâ*k*ittiyas, offences requiring repentance (see p. 32 of the same
translation). If our author was a member of the Order, as he almost
certainly was, it' would seem almost incredible that he should make an
error in a matter of such common knowledge, and of such vital
importance, as the number and nature of the Pârâ*g*ikas. And indeed, in
the immediate context, he refers to the Pâ*k*ittiya rule, though not in
the exact words used in the text of the Pâtimokkha. I think that he must
have known very well what he was talking about. And that a passage, not
yet traced, will be found in the unpublished parts of the Pi*t*akas, in
which the Buddha is made to say that falsehood is a Pârâ*g*ika--just as
a Christian might maintain that falsehood is forbidden in the Ten
Commandments, and yet be perfectly aware of the exact phraseology of the
Ten Words.

In IV, 4, 26, our author identifies the learned pig in the
Ta*kkh*a-sûkara *G*âtaka with the Bodisat. He differs here from the
*G*âtaka Commentary, in which the Bodisat is identified with the
tree-god, who acts as a kind of Greek chorus in the story. And the
summaries in IV, 4, 28 of

<span id="page_xlii">p. xlii</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Ruru *G*âtaka, and in IV, 4, 30 of the
Sabba-dâ*th*a *G*âtaka, do not exactly agree with Professor Fausböll's
text <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_39.md). But the commentary is not the
text; and it is well known that there are numerous such light variations
in the different expansions of the verses, which latter alone form the
actual text.

In IV, 4, 44 we find our author giving a version of a well-known
incident in the Buddhist Gospel story different from the oldest version
of it in the Pi*t*aka texts. This is another instance of an expansion of
the original adopted from some unknown commentator, and does not argue
an ignorance of the text as we have it.

I have noticed in the untranslated portion of our author, four or five
cases of readings apparently different from the Pi*t*aka texts he refers
to. These I hope to deal with in my next volume. But I may notice here
that two stanzas, given on p. 414 of the text, and said on p. 413 to be
'in the Sutta Nipâta,' are not found in Professor Fausböll's edition of
that work; and we have there, in all probability, another case of real
divergence. But the reading in the Milinda may possibly be found to be
incorrect.

The general result of this comparison, when we remember the very large
number of passages quoted, will be held, I trust, to confirm the
conclusion reached above, that our author knew the Pi*t*akas practically
as we now have them, that is as they have been handed down in Ceylon.

Outside the Pi*t*akas there are unfortunately no references to actual
books. But there are several references to countries and persons which
are of importance, in as much as they show a knowledge in our author of
places or occurrences not mentioned in the sacred books. It will be most
convenient to arrange these passages first in an alphabetical list, and
then to make a few remarks on the conclusions the list suggests. They
are as follows:

It will be noticed that the only names of persons, besides those
occurring in the story itself, are, in one passage, Asoka and Bindumatî
the courtesan, and in another *K*andragupta and Bhaddasâla who fought
against him. Of places, besides those in the story, we have a
considerable number of names referring to the Panjâb, and adjacent
countries; and besides these the names only of a few places or countries
on

<span id="page_xliv">p. xliv</span>

the sea coast. The island Alasanda in the Indus, and the town of Kalasi
situated in that island, have been discussed above. The country of the
Sakas and Yavanas, Gandhâra, Kashmir, Bharuka*kkh*a, Surat, and Madhura,
explain themselves. Nikumba and Vilâta were probably in the same
neighbourhood, but these names have not been met with elsewhere, and I
can suggest no identification of them. The places on the sea coast, to
which a merchant ship could sail, mentioned on p. 359, are mostly well
known. Kolapattana must, I think, be some place on the Koromandel coast,
and Suvanna-bhûmi be meant for the seaboard of Burma and Siam. The
author mentions no places in the interior south of the Ganges.

At four places he gives lists of famous rivers. In three out of the four
he simply repeats the list of five--Ga<u>n</u>gâ, Yamunâ, A*k*iravatî,
Sarabhû, and Mahî--so often enumerated together in the Pi*t*akas <span
id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_40.md). In the fourth passage ([p.
114](sbe3509.htm#page_114).md) he adds five others--the Sindhu, the
Sarassatî, the Vetravatî, the Vîta*m*sâ, and the *K*andabhâgâ. Of these
the first two are well known. Professor Eduard Müller suggests <span
id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_41.md) that the Vîta*m*sâ is the same as the
Vitastâ (the Hydaspes of the Greeks and the modern Bihat). The Vetravatî
is one of the principal affluents of the Jumna; and the *K*andabhâgâ
rises in the North-West Himâlayas, and is not unfrequently referred to
as the Asiknî of the Vedas, the Akesines of the Greek geographers, the
modern Kînâb <span id="fr_43"></span>[3](#fn_42.md).

The list is meagre enough. An ethical treatise is scarcely the place to
look for much geographical or historical matter. But unless our author
deliberately concealed his knowledge, and made all the remarks he put
into the mouth of Nâgasena correspond with what that teacher might
fairly be expected to have known, the whole list points to the definite
conclusion that the writer of the 'Questions of Milinda' resided in the
far North-West of

<span id="page_xlv">p. xlv</span>

India, or in the Panjâb itself. And this is confirmed by the great
improbability of any memory of Menander having survived elsewhere, and
more especially in Ceylon, where we should naturally look for our
author's residence if he did not live in the region thus suggested.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

As my space is here limited, I postpone to the next volume the
discussion as to how far the knowledge displayed by our author, the
conditions of society with which he shows himself acquainted, and the
religious beliefs he gives utterance to, afford evidence of his date. I
will only say here that on all these points his work shows clear signs
of being later than the Pi*t*aka texts. And in the present state of our
knowledge, or rather of our ignorance, of Pâli, there is very little to
be drawn from the language used by our author. In the first place we do
not know for certain whether we have the original before us, or a
translation from the Sanskrit or from some Northern dialect. And if, as
is probably the case, we have a translation, it would be very difficult
to say whether any peculiarity we may find in it is really due to the
translator, or to the original author. No doubt a translator, finding in
his original a word not existing in Pâli, but formed according to rules
of derivation obtaining in Pâli, would coin the corresponding Pâli form.
And in doing so he might very likely be led into mistake, if his
original were Prakrit, by misunderstanding the derivation of the Prakrit
word before him. Childers in comparing Buddhist Sanskrit with Pâli, has
pointed out several cases where such mistakes have occurred, and has
supposed that in every case the Sanskrit translator misunderstood a Pâli
word before him <span id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_43.md). As I have suggested
elsewhere it is, to say the least, quite as likely that the Sanskrit
Buddhist texts are often founded on older works, not in Pâli, but in
some other Prakrit <span id="fr_45"></span>[2](#fn_44.md). And it may be
possible hereafter to form some opinion as to what that dialect was
which the Sanskrit writers must have had before

<span id="page_xlvi">p. xlvi</span>

them, to lead them into the particular blunders they have made. In the
same way an argument may be drawn from the words found exclusively in
Milinda as to the dialect which he spoke, and in which he probably
wrote. A list of the words our author uses, and not found in the
Pi*t*akas, can only be tentative, as we have not as yet the whole of the
Pi*t*aka texts in print. But it will be useful, even now, to give the
following imperfect list of such as I have noted in my copy of Childers'
'Dictionary.'

This list might be considerably extended if words were included which
differ from those used in the Pi*t*akas only by the addition of
well-known suffixes or prefixes--such, for instance, as viparivattati,
at [p. 117](sbe3510.htm#page_117.md), only found as yet elsewhere in the
Tela Ka*t*âha Gâthâ, verse 37. But such words are really only a further
utilisation of the existing resources of the language, and would afford
little or no ground for argument as to the time and place at which our
author wrote. I have thought it best, therefore, to omit them, at least
at present.

If we turn from isolated words to the evidence of style it will be
acknowledged by every reader that the Milinda has a marked style of its
own, different alike from the formal exactness of most of the Pi*t*aka
texts, and from the later manner of any other Pâli or Sanskrit-Buddhist
authors as yet published. It is no doubt the charm of its style which
has been one of the principal reasons for the great popularity of the
book. Even a reader who takes no interest in the points that are raised,
or in the method in which the questions are discussed, will be able, I
trust, to see, even through the dark veil of a lame and wooden
translation, what the merits of the original must be. And to a devout
Buddhist, in whose eyes the book he was reading offered a correct
solution of the most serious difficulties in religion, of the deepest
problems of life,--to whose whole intellectual training and sympathies
the way in which the puzzles are put, and solved, so exactly
appealed,--to such a reader both the easy grace of the opening dialogue,
as of a ship sailing in calm waters, and the real eloquence of
occasional passages, more especially of the perorations by which the
solutions are sometimes closed, must have been a continual feast. I
venture to think that the 'Questions of Milinda' is undoubtedly the
master-piece of Indian prose; and indeed is the best book of its class,
from a literary point of view, that had then been produced in any
country. Limits of space prevent the discussion of this last
proposition, however interesting: and it would be, no doubt, difficult
to prove that anything from India was better than the corresponding
thing produced by our noble selves, or by those

<span id="page_xlix">p. xlix</span>

whose Karma we inherit. But in ancient Indian literature there are only
two or three works which can at all compare with it. It ought not to
seem odd that these also are Buddhist and Pâli; that is, that they come
from the same school. And while the Dîgha Nikâya may be held to excel it
in stately dignity, the Visuddhi Magga in sustained power, and the
*G*âtaka book in varied humour, the palm will probably be eventually
given to the 'Questions of Milinda' as a work of art.

I am aware that this conclusion is entirely at variance with the often
repeated depreciation of Buddhist literature. But the fact is that this
depreciation rests upon ignorance, and is supported by prejudice. As a
critical judgment it will not survive the publication and translation of
those great Buddhist works which it overlooks or ignores. Some Sanskrit
scholars, familiar with the Brahmin estimate of matters Indian, and
filled with a very rational and proper admiration for the many fine
qualities which the old Brahmins possessed, may find it hard to
recognise the merits of sectarian works written in dialects which
violate their most cherished laws of speech. But the historical student
of the evolution of thought, and of the rise of literature in India,
will more and more look upon the question as a whole, and will estimate
at its right value all Indian work, irrespective of dialect or creed.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[xiii:2](sbe3502.htm#fr_2.md) I believe that none of
the many vernacular literatures of India can compare for a moment with
the Si*m*halese, whether judged from the point of view of literary
excellence, variety of contents, age, or historical value. And yet a few
hundreds a year for ten years would probably suffice, on the system
followed by the Pâli Text Society, for the editing and publication of
the whole.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[xiv:1](sbe3502.htm#fr_3.md) This was already

<span id="fn_21"></span>[xxi:3](sbe3502.htm#fr_22.md) The r is a little
doubtful and is written, if at all, after the dh, though intended to be
pronounced before the m.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[xxv:1](sbe3502.htm#fr_27.md) See the passages
quoted by Dr. Wenzel in the 'Journal of the Pâli Text Society' for 1886,
pp. 1-4.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[xxv:2](sbe3502.htm#fr_28.md) See Professor Weber
in the 'Handschriftenverzeichniss der königlichen Bibliothek in Berlin,'
vol. v, part 2, p. 365.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[xxvi:1](sbe3502.htm#fr_29.md) Compare on this
point Dr. Wenzel, loc. cit., with Dr. Burgess in the 'Archaeological
Reports for Southern India,' vol. i, pp. 5-9. Dr. Burgess thinks the
most probable date of his death is about 200 A. D.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[xxvi:2](sbe3502.htm#fr_30.md) The identification
of Nâgâr*g*u*n*a and Nâgasena was made independently by Major Bird in
the 'Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society' for
October, 1844 (who was followed by the Rev. R. Spence Hardy at p. 517 of
his 'Manual of Buddhism,' published in 1860), and by Benfey in his
article 'Indien' in Ersch and Gruber's Encyclopedia (who was followed by
Burnouf at p. 570 of his 'Introduction,' &c., published in 1844).

<span id="fn_30"></span>[xxvi:3](sbe3502.htm#fr_31.md) Loc. cit. Note to
his translation of Târanâtha, p. 298.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[xxvii:1](sbe3502.htm#fr_32.md) Kern's 'Buddhismus'
(the German translation), vol. ii, p. 443.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[xxvii:2](sbe3502.htm#fr_33.md) As these pages were
passing through the press I have found Assagutta of the Vattaniya
hermitage, mentioned in the last chapter of the Saddhamma Sa*m*gaha,
which is passing through the press for the Pâli Text Society. But this
is taken no doubt from the Milinda, and is not an independent reference
to any such teacher as an historical person. (The Saddhamma Samgaha was
written by Dhamma-kitti in Ceylon, probably in the twelfth century.)

<span id="fn_33"></span>[xxxv:1](sbe3502.htm#fr_34.md) That is, not in the
Pi*t*akas. The stanza is found in the commentary on the Dhammapada
(Fausböll, p. 147), and also in Buddhaghosa's Papa*ñk*a Sûdanî (see
Trenckner's note)--each time with a variation at the close of the verse.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[xxxvi:1](sbe3502.htm#fr_35.md) Mr. Trenckner gives
no reference, and I have searched through the Sutta Nipâta, which has no
index, in vain.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[xxxvii:1](sbe3502.htm#fr_36.md) This estimate
excludes the space occupied by notes. The books marked with an asterisk
in the foregoing list have already been printed.

printed text.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[xl:1](sbe3502.htm#fr_38.md) About half of the
canonical books, besides a considerable number of the uncanonical works,
have already been edited in the last few years, chiefly owing to the
Pâli Text Society's labours.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[xl:2](sbe3502.htm#fr_39.md) See the passages
quoted in my note at [p. 9](sbe3503.htm#page_9.md).

passages quoted.

of the Pâli text.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[xliv:2](sbe3502.htm#fr_42.md) 'Journal of the Pâli
Text Society,' 1888, p. 87.

'Indische Alterthumskunde,' vol. i, p. 43 (first edition, p. 55 of the
second edition), and the passages there quoted.

his 'Pâli Dictionary,' referred to under note 3, p. xi of the
Introduction.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[xlv:2](sbe3502.htm#fr_45.md) See the note on pp.
178, 179 of my 'Buddhist Suttas.'

<span id="fn_45"></span>[xlvi:1](sbe3502.htm#fr_46.md) Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p.
252) reads anânayo.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[xlvi:2](sbe3502.htm#fr_47.md) The Si*m*halese has
bhaddiputrayo.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[xlvii:1](sbe3502.htm#fr_48.md) 1 This word has
been found in the Pi*t*akas (e. g. Ma*ggh*ima I, 480) in the sense of
'practice.'

<span id="fn_48"></span>[xlvii:2](sbe3502.htm#fr_49.md) The Pi*t*aka form
is ratana.
