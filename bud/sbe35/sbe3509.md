### BOOK III. CHAPTER 5.

1\. The king said: 'Have you, Nâgasena, seen the Buddha?'

'No, Sire.'

'Then have your teachers seen the Buddha?'

'No, Sire.'

'Then, venerable Nâgasena, there is no Buddha <span
id="fr_263"></span>[1](#fn_257)!'

'But, great king, have you seen the river Ûhâ in the Himâlaya
mountains?'

'No, Sir.'

'Or has your father seen it?'

'No, Sir.'

'Then, your Majesty, is there therefore no such river?'

'It is there. Though neither I nor my father has seen it, it is
nevertheless there.'

'Just so, great king, though neither I nor my teachers have seen the
Blessed One, nevertheless there was such a person.'

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2\. The king said: 'Is the Buddha, Nâgasena, pre-eminent?'

'Yes, he is incomparable.'

'But how do you know of one you have never seen that he is pre-eminent.'

'Now what do you think, O king? They who have never seen the ocean would
they know concerning

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

it: "Deep, unmeasurable, unfathomable is the mighty ocean. Into it do
the five great rivers flow--the Ganges, the Jumna, the A*k*iravatî, the
Sarabhû, and the Mahî--and yet is there in it no appearance of being
more empty or more full!"?'

'Yes, they would know that.'

'Just so, great king, when I think of the mighty disciples who have
passed away then do I know that the Buddha is incomparable.' \[**71**\]

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3\. The king said: 'Is it possible, Nâgasena, for others to know how
incomparable the Buddha is?'

'Yes, they may know it.'

'But how can they?'

'Long, long ago, O king, there was a master of writing, by name Tissa
the Elder, and many are the years gone by since he has died. How can
people know of him?'

'By his writing, Sir.'

'Just so, great king, whosoever sees what the Truth <span
id="fr_264"></span>[1](#fn_258) is, he sees what the Blessed One was,
for the Truth was preached by the Blessed One.'

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

4\. The king said: 'Have you, Nâgasena, seen what the Truth is?'

'Have not we disciples, O king, to conduct ourselves our lives long as
under the eye of the Buddha, and under his command <span
id="fr_265"></span>[2](#fn_259)?'

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

5\. The king said: 'Where there is no transmigration, Nâgasena, can
there be rebirth?'

'Yes, there can.'

'But how can that be? Give me an illustration.'

'Suppose a man, O king, were to light a lamp from another lamp, can it
be said that the one transmigrates from, or to, the other?'

'Certainly not.'

'Just so, great king, is rebirth without transmigration.'

'Give me a further illustration.'

'Do you recollect, great king, having learnt, when you were a boy, some
verse or other from your teacher?'

'Yes, I recollect that.'

'Well then, did that verse transmigrate from your teacher?'

'Certainly not.'

'Just so, great king, is rebirth without transmigration.'

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

6\. The king said: 'Is there such a thing, Nâgasena, as the soul <span
id="fr_266"></span>[1](#fn_260)?'

'In the highest sense, O king, there is no such thing <span
id="fr_267"></span>[2](#fn_261).'

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

7\. \[**72**\] The king said: 'Is there any being, Nâgasena, who
transmigrates from this body to another?'

'No, there is not.'

'But if so, would it not get free from its evil deeds.'

'Yes, if it were not reborn; but if it were, no <span
id="fr_268"></span>[1](#fn_262).'

'Give me an illustration.'

'Suppose, O king, a man were to steal another man's mangoes, would the
thief deserve punishment?'

'Yes.'

'But he would not have stolen the mangoes the other set in the ground.
Why would he deserve punishment?'

'Because those he stole were the result of those that were planted.'

'Just so, great king, this name-and-form commits deeds, either pure or
impure, and by that Karma another name-and-form. is reborn. And
therefore is it not set free from its evil deeds?'

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

8\. The king said: 'When deeds are committed, Nâgasena, by one
name-and-form, what becomes of those deeds?'

'The deeds would follow it, O king, like a shadow that never leaves
it <span id="fr_269"></span>[2](#fn_263).'

'Can any one point out those deeds, saying: "Here are those deeds, or
there"?'

'No.'

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

'Give me an illustration.'

'Now what do you think, O king? Can any one point out the fruits which a
tree has not yet produced, saying: "Here they are, or there"?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'Just so, great king, so long as the continuity of life is not cut off,
it is impossible to point out the deeds that are done.'

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

9\. \[**73**\] The king said: 'Does he, Nâgasena, who is about to be
reborn know that he will be born?'

'Yes, he knows it, O king.'

'Give me an illustration.'

'Suppose a farmer, O king, a householder, were to put seed in the
ground, and it were to rain well, would he know that a crop would be
produced.'

'Yes, he would know that.'

'Just so, great king, does he who is about to be reborn know <span
id="fr_270"></span>[1](#fn_264) that he will be born.'

'Very good, Nâgasena <span id="fr_271"></span>[2](#fn_265)!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

10\. The king said: 'Is there such a person as the Buddha, Nâgasena?'

'Yes.'

'Can he then, Nâgasena, be pointed out as being here or there?'

'The Blessed One, O king, has passed away by that kind of passing away
in which nothing remains which could tend to the formation of another

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

individual <span id="fr_272"></span>[1](#fn_266). It is not possible to
point out the Blessed One as being here or there.'

'Give me an illustration.'

'Now what do you think, O king? When there is a great body of fire
blazing, is it possible to point out any one flame that has gone out,
that it is here or there?'

'No, Sir. That flame has ceased, it has vanished.'

'Just so, great king, has the Blessed One passed away by that kind of
passing away in which no root remains for the formation of another
individual. The Blessed One has come to an end, and it cannot be pointed
out of him, that he is here or there. But in the body of his doctrine he
can, O king, be pointed out. For the doctrine <span
id="fr_273"></span>[2](#fn_267) was preached by the Blessed One?'

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_257"></span>[109:1](sbe3509.htm#fr_263) This dialogue is so
far identical with VI, 1, 1. It is a kind of parody on Gotama's own
argument about the Brahmans and Brahma ('Have they seen God,' &c.) in
the Tevi*gg*a Sutta I, 12-15, translated in my 'Buddhist Suttas,' pp.
172-174.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[110:1](sbe3509.htm#fr_264) Dhamma*m*, here
nearly = Buddhism. See below, III, 5, 10.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[110:2](sbe3509.htm#fr_265) Mr. Trenckner
thinks there is a lacuna here; and Hîna*t*i-kumburê's version perhaps
supports this. He renders the passage,, How can a man use a path he does
not know? And have not we <span id="page_111">p. 111</span> our lives
long to conduct ourselves according to the Vinaya (the rules of the
Order), which the Buddha preached, and which are called the eye of the
Buddha, and according to the Sikkhâpada (ethics) which be laid down, and
which are called his command?' But there are other passages, no less
amplified in the Si*m*halese, where there is evidently no lacuna in the
Pâli; and the passage may well have been meant as a kind of riddle, to
which the Si*m*halese supplies the solution.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[111:1](sbe3509.htm#fr_266) Vedagû. See above,
II, 3, 6, [p. 86](sbe3506.htm#page_86) (note).

<span id="fn_261"></span>[111:2](sbe3509.htm#fr_267) Mr. Trenckner
thinks there is a lacuna here. The Si*m*halese follow the Pâli word for
word.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[112:1](sbe3509.htm#fr_268) This is an exact
repetition of what we had above, II, 2, 6.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[112:2](sbe3509.htm#fr_269) These last words
are a quotation of those that recur at Sa*m*yutta III, 2, 10, 10, and
Dhammapada, verse 2.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[113:1](sbe3509.htm#fr_270) That is before he
is born.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[113:2](sbe3509.htm#fr_271) This is all very
parallel to II, 2, 2.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[114:1](sbe3509.htm#fr_272) Anupâdisesâya
nibbânadhâtuyâ.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[114:2](sbe3509.htm#fr_273) Dhamma. See above,
III, 5, 3.
