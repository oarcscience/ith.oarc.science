### BOOK III. CHAPTER 6.

1\. The king said: 'Is the body, Nâgasena, dear to you recluses?'

'No, they love not the body.'

'Then why do you nourish it and lavish attention upon it?'

'In all the times and places, O king, that you have gone down to battle,
did you never get wounded by an arrow?'

'Yes, that has happened to me.'

'In such cases, O king, \[**74**\] is not the wound anointed with salve,
and smeared with oil, and bound up in a bandage.'

'Yes, such things are done to it.'

'What then? Is the wound dear to you that you treat it so tenderly, and
lavish such attention upon it?'

'No, it is not dear to me in spite of all that, which is only done that
the flesh may grow again.'

'Just so, great king, with the recluses and the body. Without cleaving
to it do they bear about the body for the sake of righteousness of life.
The body, O king, has been declared by the Blessed One to be like a
wound. And therefore merely as a sore, and without cleaving to it, do
the recluses bear about the, body. For it has been said by the Blessed
One:

"Covered with clammy skin, an impure thing and foul,  
Nine-apertured, it oozes, like a sore <span
id="fr_274"></span>[1](#fn_268.md)."'

'Well answered, Nâgasena!'

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

2\. The king said: 'Did the Buddha, Nâgasena, the omniscient one,
foresee all things?'

'Yes. The Blessed One was not only omniscient. He foresaw all things.'

'Then why was it that he was in the habit only from time to time, and as
occasion arose, of laying down rules for the members of the Order <span
id="fr_275"></span>[1](#fn_269.md)?'

'Is there any physician, O king, who knows all the medicinal drugs to be
found on the earth?'

'Yes, there may be such a man.'

'Well, O king, does he give his decoctions to the patient to drink at a
time when illness has already set in, or before that?'

'When the malady has arisen.'

'Just so, great king, the Blessed One, though he was omniscient and
foresaw all things, laid down no rule at an unseasonable time, but only
when need arose did he establish a regulation which his disciples were
not to transgress as long as they lived.'

'Well answered, Nâgasena!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3\. \[**75**\] The king said: 'Is it true, Nâgasena, that the Buddha was
endowed with the thirty-two bodily marks of a great man, and graced with
the eighty subsidiary characteristics; that he was golden in colour with
a skin like gold, and that there spread around him a glorious halo of a
fathom's length?'

'Such, O king, was the Blessed One.'

'But were his parents like that?'

'No, they were not.'

'In that case you must say that he was born so. But surely a son is
either like his mother, or those on

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

the mother's side, or he is like his father, or those on the father's
side!'

The Elder replied: 'Is there such a thing, O king, as a lotus flower
with a hundred petals?'

'Yes, there is.'

'Where does it grow up?'

'It is produced in mud, and in water it comes to perfection <span
id="fr_276"></span>[1](#fn_270.md).'

'But does the lotus resemble the mud of the lake, whence it springs up,
either in colour, or in smell, or in taste?'

'Certainly not.'

'Then does it resemble the water?'

'Nor that either.'

'Just so, great king, is it that the Blessed One had the bodily signs
and marks you have mentioned, though his parents had them not.'

'Well answered, Nâgasena!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

4\. The king said: 'Was the Buddha, Nâgasena, pure in conduct (was he a
Brahma-*k*ârin)?'

'Yes, the Blessed One was pure.'

'Then, Nâgasena, it follows that he was a follower of Brahmâ <span
id="fr_277"></span>[2](#fn_271.md).'

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

'Have you a state elephant, O king?'

'Certainly.' \[**76**\]

'Well now, does that elephant ever trumpet (literally "cry the heron's
cry <span id="fr_278"></span>[1](#fn_272)".md)?'

'Oh, yes.'

'But is he, then, on that account a follower of the herons?'

'Of course not.'

'Now tell me, great king, has Brahma wisdom (Buddhi), or has he not?'

'He is a being with wisdom.'

'Then (on your argument) he is surely a follower of Buddha <span
id="fr_279"></span>[2](#fn_273.md).'

'Well answered, Nâgasena!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

5\. The king said: 'Is ordination <span id="fr_280"></span>[3](#fn_274.md)
a good thing?'

'Yes, a good thing and a beautiful.'

'But did the Buddha obtain it, or not?'

'Great king, when the Blessed One attained omniscience at the foot of
the tree of Knowledge, that was to him an ordination. There was no
conferring of ordination upon him at the hands of others--in the way
that the Blessed One laid down regulations for his disciples, never to
be transgressed by them their lives long <span
id="fr_281"></span>[4](#fn_275.md)!'

'Very true, Nâgasena!'

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

6\. The king said: 'To which of these two, Nâgasena,--the man who weeps
at the death of his mother, and the man who weeps out of love for the
Truth (Dhamma),--are his tears a cure?'

'The tears of the one, O king, are stained and hot with the three fires
of passion. The tears of the other are stainless and cool. Now there is
cure in coolness and calm, but in heat and passion there can be no
cure <span id="fr_282"></span>[1](#fn_276.md).'

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

7\. The king said: 'What is the distinction, Nâgasena, between him who
is full of passion, and him who is void of passion?'

'The one is overpowered by craving, O king, and the other not.'

'But what does that mean?'

'The one is in want, O king, and the other not.'

'I look at it, Sir, in this way. He who has passion and he who has
not--both of them alike--desire what is good to eat, either hard or
soft. And neither of them desires what is wrong.'

'The lustful man, O king, in eating his food enjoys both the taste and
the lust that arises from taste, \[**77**\] but the man free from lusts
experiences the taste only, and not the lust arising therefrom.'

'Well answered, Nâgasena!'

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

8\. The king said: 'Venerable Nâgasena, where does wisdom dwell?'

'Nowhere, O king.'

'Then, Sir, there is no such thing as wisdom.'

'Where does the wind dwell, O king?'

'Not anywhere, Sir.'

'So there is no such thing as wind.'

'Well answered, Nâgasena!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

9\. The king said: 'When you speak of transmigration <span
id="fr_283"></span>[1](#fn_277.md), Nâgasena, what does that mean?'

'A being born here, O king, dies here. Having died here, it springs up
elsewhere. Having been born there, there it dies. Having died there, it
springs up elsewhere. That is what is meant by transmigration.'

'Give me an illustration.'

'It is like the case of a man who, after eating a mango, should set the
seed in the ground. From that a great tree would be produced and give
fruit. And there would be no end to the succession, in that way, of
mango trees.'

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

10\. The king said: 'By what, Nâgasena, does one recollect what is past
and done long ago?'

'By memory.'

'But is it not by the mind <span id="fr_284"></span>[2](#fn_278.md), not by
the memory <span id="fr_285"></span>[2](#fn_278.md), that we recollect?'

'Do you recollect any business, O king, that you have done and then
forgotten?'

'Yes.'

'What then? Were you then without a mind?'

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

'No. But my memory failed me.'

'Then why do you say that it is by the mind, not by the memory, that we
recollect?'

'Very good, Nâgasena <span id="fr_286"></span>[1](#fn_279.md)'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

11\. The king said: 'Does memory, Nâgasena, always arise subjectively,
\[**78**\] or is it stirred up by suggestion from outside <span
id="fr_287"></span>[1](#fn_279.md)?'

'Both the one and the other.'

'But does not that amount to all memory being subjective in origin, and
never artificial?'

'If, O king, there were no artificial (imparted) memory, then artisans
would have no need of practice, or art, or schooling, and teachers would
be useless. But the contrary is the case.'

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

Here ends the Sixth Chapter.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_268"></span>[115:1](sbe3510.htm#fr_274.md) I have not been
able to trace this couplet. On the sentiment compare the eloquent words
of the young wife at vol. i, p. 200 of my 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' and
Sutta Nipâta I, 11.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[116:1](sbe3510.htm#fr_275.md) This is how
Hîna*t*i-kumburê understands the passage.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[117:1](sbe3510.htm#fr_276.md) Âsîyati. See Dr.
Morris in the 'Journal of the Pâli Text Society,' 1884, p. 72.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[117:2](sbe3510.htm#fr_277.md) There is an
untranslatable play here upon the name of the god, which is used in its
sense of 'pure, best,' in the expression 'pure in conduct.' The first
question really amounts to: Was the Buddha's conduct 'Brahma,' that is,
'best,' which has come to have the meaning 'pure' for the same reason
that our expression 'a moral man' has often that particular connotation?
It is quite true that the etymological meaning of the word is neither
'best' nor 'pure'; but when our author wrote the secondary sense had
completely, in Pâli, driven out the etymological sense.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[118:1](sbe3510.htm#fr_278.md) This technical term
for an elephant's trumpeting is not infrequent. See, for instance,
*G*âtaka I, 50.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[118:2](sbe3510.htm#fr_279.md) As a matter of fact
Brahmâ, the nearest approach in the Indian thought of that time to our
idea of God, is always represented, in Buddhism, as a good Buddhist,
See, for instance, 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 116, and my note at p. 117.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[118:3](sbe3510.htm#fr_280.md) 'Upasampadâ.
Admission to the higher grade in the Order.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[118:4](sbe3510.htm#fr_281.md) Mr. Trenckner again
suspects something dropped out in this reply. But the connection of
ideas seems to me quite sufficient. <span id="page_119">p. 119</span>
The Si*m*halese follows the Pâli, but that of course only shows that the
text before the translator was here the same as in Mr. Trenckner's
edition.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[119:1](sbe3510.htm#fr_282.md) The point of this
lies in the allusion to the coolness and calm of Nirvâna, or Arahatship,
which is the dying out of the three fires of lust, ill-will, and
delusion. The word used for coolness, Sîtala, is one of the many
epithets of Arahatship.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[120:1](sbe3510.htm#fr_283.md) Sa*m*sâra.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[120:2](sbe3510.htm#fr_285.md) *K*ittena, no
satiyâ.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[121:1](sbe3510.htm#fr_287.md) I follow
Hîna*t*i-kumburê's interpretation of the difficult words in the text,
which Mr. Trenckner says is corrupt. Ka*t*umika is 'artificial,' like
the Sanskrit k*ri*trima. It has only been found as yet in our author.
