### BOOK IV. CHAPTER 4.

### \[THE MURDER OF MOGGALLÂNA.\]

1\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, it has been said by the Blessed One: "This is
the chief, O Bhikkhus, of those of my disciples in the Order who are
possessed of the power of Iddhi, I mean Moggallâna <span
id="fr_556"></span>[1](#fn_547.md)." But on the other hand they say his
death took place by his being beaten to death with clubs, so that his
skull was broken, and his bones ground to powder, and all his flesh and
nerves bruised and pounded together <span
id="fr_557"></span>[2](#fn_548.md). Now, Nâgasena, if the Elder, the great
Moggallâna, had really attained to supremacy in the magical power of
Iddhi, then it cannot be true that he was beaten to death with
clubs <span id="fr_558"></span>[3](#fn_549.md). But if his death was on
that wise, then the saying that he was chief of those possessed of Iddhi
must be wrong. How could he who was not even able, by his power of
Iddhi, to prevent his own murder, be worthy nevertheless to stand as
succour to the world of gods and men? This too is a double-edged problem
now put to you, and you have to solve it.'

2\. 'The Blessed One did declare, O king, that Moggallâna was chief
among the disciples in power

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

of Iddhi. And he was nevertheless beaten to death by clubs. But that was
through his being then possessed by the still greater power of
Karma <span id="fr_559"></span>[1](#fn_550.md).'

3\. 'But, venerable Nâgasena, \[**189**\] are not both of these things
appurtenant to him who has the power of Iddhi--that is the extent of his
power, and the result of his Karma--both alike unthinkable? And cannot
the unthinkable be held back by the unthinkable? Just, Sir, as those who
want the fruits will knock a wood apple <span
id="fr_560"></span>[2](#fn_551.md) down with a wood apple, or a mango with
a mango, so ought not the unthinkable in like manner to be subject to
restraint by the unthinkable?'

'Even among things beyond the reach of the imagination, great king,
still one is in excess above the other, one more powerful than the
other. Just, O king, as the monarchs of the world are alike in kind, but
among them, so alike in kind, one may overcome the rest, and bring them
under his command--just so among things beyond the grasp of the
imagination is the productive effect of Karma by far the most powerful.
It is precisely the effect of Karma which overcomes all the rest, and
has them under its rule; and no other influence is of any avail to the
man in whom Karma is working out its inevitable end <span
id="fr_561"></span>[3](#fn_552.md). It is as when, O king, any man has
committed an offence against the law <span
id="fr_562"></span>[4](#fn_553.md).

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Neither his mother nor his father, neither his
sisters nor his brother, neither his friends nor his intimate associates
can protect him then. He has fallen therein under the power of the king
who will issue his command respecting him. And why is that so? Because
of the wrong that he has done. So is it precisely the effect of Karma
which overcomes all other influences, and has them under its command,
and no other influence can avail the man in whom Karma is working out
its inevitable end. It is as when a jungle fire has arisen on the earth,
then can not even a thousand pots of water avail to put it out, but the
conflagration overpowers all, and brings it under its control. And why
is that so? Because of the fierceness of its heat. So is it precisely
the effect of Karma which overcomes all other influences, and has them
under its command; and no other influence can avail the man in whom
Karma is working out its inevitable end. That is why the venerable one,
great king, the great Moggallâna, when, at a time when he was possessed
by Karma, he was being beaten to death with clubs, was yet unable to
make use of his power of Iddhi <span id="fr_563"></span>[1](#fn_554.md).'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the problem as to the murder of Moggallâna.\]

 

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

### \[ON SECRET DOCTRINE.\]

4\. \[**190**\] 'Venerable Nâgasena, it was said by the Blessed One:
"The Dhamma and the Vinaya (Doctrine and Canon Law) proclaimed by the
Tathâgata shine forth when they are displayed, and not when they are
concealed <span id="fr_564"></span>[1](#fn_555.md)." But on the other hand
the recitation of the Pâtimokkha and the whole of the Vinaya Pi*t*aka
are closed and kept secret <span id="fr_565"></span>[2](#fn_556.md). So
that if, Nâgasena, you (members of the Order) carried out what is just,
and right, and held of faith in the teaching of the Conqueror then would
the Vinaya shine forth as an open thing. And why would that be so?
Because all the instruction therein, the discipline, the self-control,
the regulations as to moral and virtuous conduct, are in their essence
full of truth and righteousness, and redounding to emancipation of
heart. But if the Blessed One really said that the Dhamma and Vinaya
proclaimed by the Tathâgata shine forth when displayed and not when kept
secret, then the saying that the recitation of the Pâtimokkha and the
whole of the Vinaya must be kept secret must be wrong. And if that be
right, then the saying of the Blessed One must be wrong. This too is a
double-edged problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.'

5\. 'It was said, O king, by the Blessed One that the Dhamma and Vinaya
proclaimed by the Tathâgata

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

shine forth when displayed, and not when kept secret. And on the other
hand the recitation of the Pâtimokkha and the whole of the Vinaya
Pi*t*aka are kept close and secret <span
id="fr_566"></span>[1](#fn_557.md). But this last is not the case as
regards all men. They are only kept secret up to a certain limit. And
the recitation of the Pâtimokkha is kept secret up to that certain limit
on three grounds--firstly because that is the traditional custom <span
id="fr_567"></span>[2](#fn_558.md) of previous Tathâgatas, secondly out of
respect for the Truth (Dhamma), and thirdly out of respect for the
position of a member of the Order <span
id="fr_568"></span>[3](#fn_559.md).'

6\. 'And as to the first it was the universal custom, O king, of
previous Tathâgatas for the recitation of the Pâtimokkha to take place
in the midst of the members of the Order only, to the exclusion of all
others. Just, O king, as the Kshatriya secret formulas (of the nobles)
are handed down among the nobles alone, and that this or that is so is
common tradition among the nobles <span id="fr_569"></span>[4](#fn_560.md)
of the world and kept secret from all others--\[**191**\] so was this
the universal custom of previous Tathâgatas, that the recitation of the
Pâtimokkha should take place among the

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

members of the Order only, and be kept secret from all others. And
again, just as there are several classes of people, O king, known as
distinct in the world---such as wrestlers, tumblers, jugglers, actors,
ballet-dancers, and followers of the mystic cult of the sun and moon, of
the goddess of fortune and other gods <span
id="fr_570"></span>[1](#fn_561.md). And the secrets of each of these sects
are handed on in the sect itself, and kept hidden from all others. just
so with the universal custom of all the Tathâgatas that the recitation
of the Pâtimokkha should take place before the members of the Order
only, and be kept secret from all others. This is why the recitation of
the Pâtimokkha is, up to that extent, kept secret in accordance with the
habit of previous Tathâgatas.'

7\. 'And how is it that the Pâtimokkha is kept secret, up to that
extent, out of reverence for the Dhamma? The Dhamma, great king, is
venerable and weighty. He who has attained to proficiency in it may
exhort another in this wise: "Let not this Dhamma so full of truth, so
excellent, fall into the hands of those unversed in it, where it would
be despised and contemned, treated shamefully, made a game of, and found
fault with. Nor let it fall into the hands of the wicked who would deal
with it in all respects as badly as they." It is thus, O king, that the
recitation of the Pâtimokkha is, up to that

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

extent, kept secret out of reverence for the Dhamma. For if not, then it
would be like the best, most costly, and most rare red sandal wood of
the finest kind, which when brought to Savara (that city of the outcast
Ka*nd*âlas <span id="fr_571"></span>[1](#fn_562).md) is despised and
contemned, treated shamefully, made game of, and found fault with.'

8\. \[**192**\] 'And how is it that the Pâtimokkha is kept secret, up to
that extent, out of reverence for the position of a member of the Order?
The condition of a Bhikkhu, great king, is in glory beyond the reach of
calculation by weight, or measure, or price. None can value it, weigh
it, measure it. And the recitation of the Pâtimokkha, is carried on
before the Bhikkhus alone, lest any one who has occupied that position
should be brought down to a level with the men of the world. just, O
king, as if there be any priceless thing, in vesture or floor covering,
in elephants, chargers, or chariots, in gold or silver or jewels or
pearls or women, or in unsurpassable strong drink <span
id="fr_572"></span>[2](#fn_563.md), all such things are the appanage of
kings--just so, O king, whatever is most priceless in the way of
training, of the traditions of the Blessed One, of learning, of conduct,
and of the virtues of righteousness and self-control--all these are the
appanages of the Order of Bhikkhus. This is why the recitation of the
Pâtimokkha is, to that extent, kept secret <span
id="fr_573"></span>[3](#fn_564.md).'

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the problem as to the secrecy in which the Vinaya is kept.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### \[THE TWO KINDS OF FALSEHOOD.\]

9\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, it has been said by the Blessed One that a
deliberate lie is an offence of the greatest kind (involving exclusion
from the Order <span id="fr_574"></span>[1](#fn_565).md).

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

\[paragraph continues\] And again he said: "By a deliberate lie a
Bhikkhu commits a minor offence, one that ought to be the subject of
confession made before another (member of the Order) <span
id="fr_575"></span>[1](#fn_566.md)." Now, venerable Nâgasena, what is
herein the distinction, what the reason, that by one lie a Bhikkhu is
cast out of the Order, and by another he is guilty only of an offence
that can be atoned for. If the first decision be right, then the second
must be wrong; but if the second be right, then the first must be wrong.
This too is a double-edged problem now put to you, and you have to solve
it.'

10\. \[**193**\] <span id="fr_576"></span>[2](#fn_567.md)'Both your
quotations, O king, are correct <span id="fr_577"></span>[3](#fn_568.md).
But a falsehood is a light or heavy offence according to the subject
matter. For what do you think, great king? Suppose a man were to give
another a slap with his hand, what punishment would you inflict upon
him?'

'If the other refused to overlook the matter, then neither should we be
able to pardon his assailant <span id="fr_578"></span>[4](#fn_569.md), but
should mulct him in a penny or so <span
id="fr_579"></span>[5](#fn_570.md).'

'But on the other hand, suppose it had been you

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

yourself that he had given the blow to, what would then be the
punishment?'

'We should condemn him to have his hands cut off, and his feet cut off,
and to be skinned alive <span id="fr_580"></span>[1](#fn_571.md), and we
should confiscate all the goods in his house, and put to death all his
family to the seventh generation on both sides.'

'But, great king, what is the distinction? Why is it that for one slap
of the hand there should be a gentle fine of a penny, while for a slap
given to you there should be so fearful a retribution?'

'Because of the difference in the person (assaulted).'

'Well! just so, great king, is a falsehood a light or a heavy offence
according to the attendant circumstances.'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the problem as to the degree of offence in falsehood.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### \[THE BODISAT'S CONSIDERATION.\]

11\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, it has been said by the Blessed One in the
discourse on the essential conditions <span
id="fr_581"></span>[2](#fn_572.md): "Long ago have his parents been
destined for each Bodisat, and the kind of tree he is to select for his
Bo tree, and the

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Bhikkhus who are to be his two chief disciples,
and the lad who is to be his son, and the member of the Order who is to
be his special attendant." But on the other hand he said: "When yet in
the condition of a god in the Tusita heaven the Bodisat makes the eight
Great Investigations--he investigates the time (whether the right moment
had come at which he ought to be re-born as a man), and the continent
(in which his birth is to take place), and the country (where he is to
be re-born), and the family (to which he is to belong), and the mother
(who is to bear him), and the period (during which he was to remain in
the womb), and the month (in which his birthday shall come), and his
renunciation (when it shall be) <span id="fr_582"></span>[1](#fn_573.md).
\[**194**\] Now, Nâgasena, before knowledge is ripe there is no
understanding, but when it has reached its summit there is no longer any
need to wait for thinking a matter over <span
id="fr_583"></span>[1](#fn_573.md), for there is nothing outside the ken of
the omniscient mind. Why then should the Bodisat investigate the time,
thinking to himself: "In what moment shall I be born <span
id="fr_584"></span>[2](#fn_574.md)?" And for the same reason why should he
investigate the family, thinking to himself:

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "In what family shall I be born?" And if,
Nâgasena, it is a settled matter who shall be the parents of the
Bodisat, then it must be false that he "investigated the family." But if
that be true, then must the other saying be wrong. This too is a
double-edged problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.'

12\. 'It was both a settled matter, O king, who should be the parents of
the Bodisat, and he did investigate into the question as to which family
he was to be born into. But how did he do so? He thought over the matter
as to whether his parents should be nobles or Brahmans. With respect to
eight things, O king, should the future be investigated before it comes
to pass. A merchant, O king, should investigate goods before he buys
them--an elephant should try with its trunk a path it has not yet
trod--a cartman should try a ford he has not yet crossed over--a pilot
should test a shore he has not yet arrived at, and so guide the ship--a
physician should find out the period of life which his patient has
lasted <span id="fr_585"></span>[1](#fn_575.md) before he treats his
disease--a traveller should test the stability of a bambû bridge <span
id="fr_586"></span>[2](#fn_576.md)before he mounts on to it--a Bhikkhu
should find out how much time has yet to run before sun turn before he
begins to eat his meal--and Bodisats, before they are born, should
investigate the question whether it would be right for them to be born
in the family of a noble or of a Brahman.

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

\[paragraph continues\] These are the eight occasions on which
investigation ought to precede action.'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the problem as to the Bodisat's consideration.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### \[ON SUICIDE.\]

13\. \[**195**\] 'Venerable Nâgasena, it has been said by the Blessed
One: "A brother is not, O Bhikkhus, to commit suicide. Whosoever does so
shall be dealt with according to the law <span
id="fr_587"></span>[1](#fn_577.md)." And on the other hand you (members of
the Order) say: "On whatsoever subject the Blessed One was addressing
the disciples, he always, and with various similes, preached to them in
order to bring about the destruction of birth, of old age, of disease,
and of death. And whosoever overcame birth, old age, disease, and death,
him did he honour with the highest praise <span
id="fr_588"></span>[2](#fn_578.md)." Now if the Blessed One forbade suicide
that saying of yours must be wrong, but if not then the prohibition of
suicide must be wrong. This too is a double-edged problem now put to
you, and you have to solve it.'

14\. 'The regulation you quote, O king, was laid down by the Blessed
One, and yet is our saying you refer to true. And there is a reason for
this, a

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

reason for which the Blessed One both prohibited (the destruction of
life), and also (in another sense) instigated us to it.'

'What, Nâgasena, may that reason be?'

'The good man, O king, perfect in uprightness, is like a medicine to
men <span id="fr_589"></span>[1](#fn_579.md) in being an antidote to the
poison of evil, he is like water to men in laying the dust and the
impurities of evil dispositions, he is like a jewel treasure to men in
bestowing upon them all attainments in righteousness, he is like a boat
to men inasmuch as he conveys them to the further shore of the four
flooded streams (of lust, individuality, delusion, and ignorance) <span
id="fr_590"></span>[2](#fn_580.md), he is like a caravan owner to men in
that he brings them beyond the sandy desert of rebirths, he is like a
mighty rain cloud to men in that he fills their hearts with
satisfaction, he is like a teacher to men in that he trains them in all
good, he is like a good guide to men in that he points out to them the
path of peace. It was in order that so good a man as that, one whose
good qualities are so many, so various, so immeasurable, \[**196**\] in
order that so great a treasure mine of good things, so full of benefit
to all beings, might not be done away with, that the Blessed One, O
king, out of his mercy towards all beings, laid down that injunction,
when he said: "A brother is not, O Bhikkhus, to commit suicide.
Whosoever does so shall be dealt with according to the law." This is the
reason for which the Blessed One prohibited (self-slaughter). And it was
said, O king,

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

by the Elder Kumâra Kassapa, the eloquent, when he was describing to
Pâyâsi the Râ*g*anya the other world: "So long as Sama*n*as and Brahmans
of uprightness of life, and beauty of character, continue to
exist--however long that time may be--just so long do they conduct
themselves to the advantage and happiness of the great masses of the
people, to the good and the gain and the weal of gods and men <span
id="fr_591"></span>[1](#fn_581.md)!"'

15\. 'And what is the reason for which the Blessed One instigated us (to
put an end to life)? Birth, O king, is full of pain, and so is old age,
and disease, and death. Sorrow is painful, and so is lamentation, and
pain, and grief, and despair. Association with the unpleasant is
painful, and separation from the pleasant <span
id="fr_592"></span>[2](#fn_582.md). The death of a mother is painful, or of
a father, or a brother, or a sister, or a son, or a wife, or of any
relative. Painful is the ruin of one's family, and the suffering of
disease, and the loss of wealth, and decline in goodness, and the loss
of insight.

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Painful is the fear produced by despots, or by
robbers, or by enemies, or by famine, or by fire, or by flood, or by the
tidal wave, or by earthquake, or by crocodiles or alligators. Painful is
the fear of possible blame attaching to oneself, or to others, the fear
of punishment, the fear of misfortune. Painful is the fear arising from
shyness in the presence of assemblies of one's fellows, painful is
anxiety as to one's means of livelihood, painful the foreboding of
death. \[**197**\] Painful are (the punishments inflicted on criminals),
such as being flogged with whips, or with sticks, or with split rods,
having one's hands cut off, or one's feet, or one's hands and feet, or
one's ears, or one's nose, or one's ears and nose. Painful are (the
tortures inflicted on traitors)--being subjected to the Gruel Pot (that
is, having boiling gruel poured into one's head from the top of which
the skull bone has been removed <span
id="fr_593"></span>[1](#fn_583).md)--or to the Chank Crown <span
id="fr_594"></span>[2](#fn_584.md) (that is, having the scalp rubbed with
gravel till it becomes smooth like a polished shell)--or to the Râhu's
Mouth <span id="fr_595"></span>[3](#fn_585.md) (that is, having one's mouth
held open by iron pins, and oil put in it, and a wick lighted
therein)--or to the Fire Garland <span id="fr_596"></span>[4](#fn_586.md)
or to the Hand Torch <span id="fr_597"></span>[5](#fn_587.md), (that is,
being made a living torch, the whole body, or the arms only, being
wrapped up in oily cloths, and set on fire)--or to the Snake
Strips <span id="fr_598"></span>[6](#fn_588.md) (that is, being skinned in
strips from the neck to the hips, so that the skin falls in strips round
the legs)or to the Bark Dress <span id="fr_599"></span>[7](#fn_589.md)
(that is, being skinned alive from the neck downwards, and having each
strip of

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

skin as soon as removed tied to the hair, so that these strips form a
veil around one)--or to the Spotted Antelope <span
id="fr_600"></span>[1](#fn_590.md) (that is, having one's knees and elbows
tied together, and being made to squat on a plate of iron under which a
fire is lit)--or to the Flesh-hooks <span
id="fr_601"></span>[2](#fn_591.md) (that is, being hung up on a row of iron
hooks)--or to the Pennies <span id="fr_602"></span>[3](#fn_592.md) (that
is, having bits cut out of the flesh, all over the body, of the size of
pennies)--or to the Brine Slits <span id="fr_603"></span>[4](#fn_593.md)
(that is, having cuts made all over one's body by means of knives or
sharp points, and then having salt and caustic liquids poured over the
wounds)--or to the Bar Turn <span id="fr_604"></span>[5](#fn_594.md) (that
is, being transfixed to the ground by a bar of iron passing through the
root of the ear, and then being dragged round and round by the leg)--or
to the Straw Seat <span id="fr_605"></span>[6](#fn_595.md) (that is, being
so beaten with clubs that

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

the bones are broken, and the body becomes like a heap of straw)--or to
be anointed with boiling oil, or to be eaten by dogs, or to be impaled
alive, or to be beheaded. Such and such, O king, are the manifold and
various pains which a being caught in the whirlpool of births and
rebirths has to endure. just, O king, as the water rained down upon the
Himâlaya mountain flows, in its course along the Ganges, through and
over rocks and pebbles and gravel, whirlpools and eddies and
rapids <span id="fr_606"></span>[1](#fn_596.md), and the stumps and
branches of trees which obstruct and oppose its passage,--just so has
each being caught in the succession of births and rebirths to endure
such and such manifold and various pains. Full of pain, then, is the
continual succession of rebirths, a joy is it when that succession ends.
And it was in pointing out the advantage of that end, the disaster
involved in that succession, that the Blessed One, great king,
instigated us to get beyond birth, and old age, and disease, and death
by the realisation of the final end of that succession of rebirths. This
is the sense, O king, which led the Blessed One to instigate us (to put
an end to life).'

'Very good, Nâgasena! Well solved is the puzzle (I put), well set forth
are the reasons (you alleged). That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

### \[A LOVING DISPOSITION.\]

16\. \[1981 'Venerable Nâgasena, it has been said by the Blessed One:
"Eleven advantages, O brethren, may be anticipated from practising,
making a habit of, enlarging within one, using as a means of
advancement, and as a basis of conduct, pursuing after, accumulating,
and rising well up to the very heights of the emancipation of heart,
arising from a feeling of love (towards all beings) <span
id="fr_607"></span>[1](#fn_597.md). And what are these eleven? He who does
so sleeps in peace, and in peace does he awake. He dreams no sinful
dreams. He becomes dear to men, and to the beings who are not men  <span
id="fr_608"></span>[2](#fn_598.md). The gods watch over him. Neither fire,
nor poison, nor sword works any harm to him. Quickly and easily does he
become tranquillised. The aspect of his countenance is calm. Undismayed
does he meet death, and should he not press through to the Supreme
Condition (of Arahatship), then is he sure of rebirth in the Brahma
world <span id="fr_609"></span>[3](#fn_599.md)." But on the other hand you
(members of

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

the Order) say that "Sâma the Prince, while dwelling in the cultivation
of a loving disposition toward all beings, and when he was (in
consequence thereof) wandering in the forest followed by a herd of deer,
was hit by a poisoned arrow shot by Piliyakkha the king, and there, on
the spot, fainted and fell <span id="fr_610"></span>[1](#fn_600.md)." Now,
venerable Nâgasena, if the passage I have quoted from the words of the
Blessed One be right, then this statement of yours must be wrong. But if
the story of Prince Sâma be right, then it cannot be true that neither
fire, nor poison, nor sword can work harm to him who cultivates the
habit of love to all beings. This too is a double-edged problem, so
subtle, so abstruse, so delicate, and so profound, that the thought of
having to solve it might well bring out sweat over the body even of the
most subtle-minded of mortals. This problem is now put to you. Unravel
this mighty knot <span id="fr_611"></span>[2](#fn_601.md). Throw light upon
this matter <span id="fr_612"></span>[3](#fn_602.md) to the accomplishment
of the desire of those sons of the Conqueror who shall arise
hereafter <span id="fr_613"></span>[4](#fn_603.md).'

'The Blessed One spake, O king, as you have quoted. And Prince Sama
dwelling in the cultivation of love, and thus followed by a herd of deer
when he was wandering in the forest, was hit by the poisoned arrow shot
by king Piliyakkha, and then and there fainted and fell. But there is a
reason for that. \[**199**\] And what is the reason? Simply that those
virtues (said in the passage you quoted

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

to be in the habit of love) are virtues not attached to the personality
of the one who loves, but to the actual presence of the love that he has
called up in his heart <span id="fr_614"></span>[1](#fn_604.md). And when
Prince Sâma was upsetting the water-pot, that moment he lapsed from the
actual feeling of love. At the moment, O king, in which an individual
has realised the sense of love, that moment neither fire, nor poison,
nor sword can do him harm. If any men bent on doing him an injury come
up, they will not see him, neither will they have a chance of hurting
him. But these virtues, O king, are not inherent in the individual, they
are in the actual felt presence of the love that he is calling up in his
heart.'

'Suppose, O king, a man were to take into his hand a Vanishing Root of
supernatural power; and that, so long as it was actually in his hand, no
other ordinary person would be able to see him. The virtue, then, would
not be in the man. It would be in the root that such virtue would reside
that an object in the very line of sight of ordinary mortals could,
nevertheless, not be seen. just so, O king, is it with the virtue
inherent in the felt presence of love that a man has called up in his
heart.'

'Or it is like the case of a man \[**200**\] who has entered into a
well-formed mighty cave. No storm of rain, however mightily it might
pour down, would be able to wet him. But that would be by no virtue
inherent

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

in the man. It would be a virtue inherent in the cave that so mighty a
downpour of rain could not wet the man. And just so, O king, is it with
the virtue inherent in the felt presence of love that a man has called
up in his heart <span id="fr_615"></span>[1](#fn_605.md).'

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

'Most wonderful is it, Nâgasena, and most strange how the felt presence
of love has the power of warding off all evil states of mind <span
id="fr_616"></span>[1](#fn_606.md).'

'Yes! The practice of love is productive of all virtuous conditions of
mind both in good (beings) and in evil ones. To all beings whatsoever,
who are in the bonds of conscious existence <span
id="fr_617"></span>[2](#fn_607.md), is this practice of love of great
advantage, and therefore ought it to be sedulously cultivated.'

### \[DEVADATTA.\]

17\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, is the consequence the same to him who does
good and to him who does evil, or is there any difference in the two
cases?'

'There is a difference, O king, between good and evil. Good works have a
happy result, and lead to Sagga <span id="fr_618"></span>[3](#fn_608.md),
and evil works have an unhappy result, and lead to Niraya <span
id="fr_619"></span>[4](#fn_609.md).'

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

'But, venerable Nâgasena, your people say that Devadatta was altogether
wicked, full of wicked dispositions, and that the Bodisat <span
id="fr_620"></span>[1](#fn_610.md) was altogether pure, full of pure
dispositions <span id="fr_621"></span>[2](#fn_611.md). And yet Devadatta,
through successive existences <span id="fr_622"></span>[3](#fn_612.md), was
not only quite equal to the Bodisat, but even sometimes superior to him,
both in reputation and in the number of his adherents.

18\. 'Thus, Nâgasena, when Devadatta became the Purohita (family
Brâhman, royal chaplain) of Brahmadatta, the king, in the city of
Benares, then the Bodisat was a wretched Ka*nd*âla (outcast) <span
id="fr_623"></span>[4](#fn_613.md) who knew by heart a magic spell. And by
repeating his spell he produced mango fruits out of season <span
id="fr_624"></span>[5](#fn_614.md). This

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

is one case in which the Bodisat was inferior to Devadatta in birth,
\[**201**\] inferior to him in reputation.'

19\. 'And again, when Devadatta became a king, a mighty monarch of the
earth <span id="fr_625"></span>[1](#fn_615.md), living in the enjoyment of
all the pleasures of sense, then the Bodisat was an elephant, decked
with all manner of ornaments that the king might make use of them. And
the king, being put out of temper at the sight of his graceful and
pleasant style of pace and motion, said to the elephant trainer with the
hope of bringing about the death of the elephant: "Trainer, this
elephant has not been properly trained, make him perform the trick
called 'Sky walking.'" In that case too the Bodisat was inferior to
Devadatta,--was a mere foolish animal <span
id="fr_626"></span>[2](#fn_616.md).'

20\. 'And again, when Devadatta became a man who gained his living by
winnowing grain <span id="fr_627"></span>[3](#fn_617.md), then

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

the Bodisat was a monkey called "the broad earth." Here again we have
the difference between an animal and a man, and the Bodisat was inferior
in birth to Devadatta <span id="fr_628"></span>[1](#fn_618.md).'

21\. 'And again, when Devadatta became a man, by name So*n*uttara, a
Nesâda (one of an outcast tribe of aborigines, who lived by hunting),
and was of great strength and bodily power, like an elephant, then the
Bodisat was the king of elephants under the name of the "Six-tusked."
And in that birth, the hunter slew the elephant. In that case too
Devadatta was the superior <span id="fr_629"></span>[2](#fn_619.md).'

22\. 'And again, when Devadatta became a man, a wanderer in the woods,
without a home, then the Bodisat was a bird, a partridge who knew the
Vedic hymns. And in that birth too the woodman killed the bird. So in
that case also Devadatta was the superior by birth <span
id="fr_630"></span>[3](#fn_620.md).'

23\. 'And again, when Devadatta became the king of Benares, by name
Kalâbu, then the Bodisat was an ascetic who preached kindness to
animals. And the king (who was fond of sport), enraged with the ascetic,
had his hands and feet cut off like so many bambû sprouts <span
id="fr_631"></span>[4](#fn_621.md). In that birth, too, Devadatta

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

was the superior, both in birth and in reputation among men.'

24\. 'And again, when Devadatta became a man, a woodman, then the
Bodisat was Nandiya the monkey king. And in that birth too the man
killed the monkey, and his mother besides, and his younger brother. So
in that case also it was Devadatta who was the superior in birth <span
id="fr_632"></span>[1](#fn_622.md).'

25\. 'And again, when Devadatta became a man, a naked ascetic, by name
Kârambhiya, then the Bodisat was a snake king called "the Yellow one."
So in that case too it was Devadatta \[**202**\] who was the superior in
birth <span id="fr_633"></span>[2](#fn_623.md).'

26\. 'And again, when Devadatta became a man, a crafty ascetic with long
matted hair, then the Bodisat was a famous pig, by name "the Carpenter."
So in that case too it was Devadatta who was the superior in birth <span
id="fr_634"></span>[3](#fn_624.md).'

27\. 'And again, when Devadatta became a king among the *K*etas, by name
Sura Pari*k*ara <span id="fr_635"></span>[4](#fn_625.md), who had the power
of travelling through the air at a level above men's heads <span
id="fr_636"></span>[5](#fn_626.md), then the Bodisat was a Brahman

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

named Kapila. So in that case too it was Devadatta who was the superior
in birth and in reputation.'

28\. 'And again, when Devadatta became a man, by name Sâma, then the
Bodisat was a king among the deer, by name Ruru. So in that case too it
was Devadatta who was the superior in birth <span
id="fr_637"></span>[1](#fn_627.md).'

29\. 'And again, when Devadatta became a man, a hunter wandering in the
woods, then the Bodisat was a male elephant, and that hunter seven times
broke off and took away the teeth of the elephant. So in that case too
it was Devadatta who was the superior in respect of the class of beings
into which he was born <span id="fr_638"></span>[2](#fn_628.md).'

30\. 'And again, when Devadatta became a jackal who wanted to conquer
the world <span id="fr_639"></span>[3](#fn_629.md), and brought the kings
of all the countries in India under his control, then the Bodisat was a
wise man, by name Vidhura. So in that case too it was Devadatta who was
the superior in glory.'

31\. 'And again, when Devadatta became the

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

elephant who destroyed the young of the Chinese partridge, then the
Bodisat was also an elephant, the leader of his herd. So in that case
they were both on a par <span id="fr_640"></span>[1](#fn_630.md).'

32\. 'And again, when Devadatta became a, yakkha, by name Unrighteous,
then the Bodisat too was a yakkha, by name Righteous. So in that case
too they were both on a par <span id="fr_641"></span>[2](#fn_631.md).'

33\. 'And again, when Devadatta became a sailor, the chief of five
hundred families, then the Bodisat too was a sailor, the chief of five
hundred families. So in that case too they were both on a par <span
id="fr_642"></span>[3](#fn_632.md).'

34\. 'And again, when Devadatta became a caravan leader, the lord of
five hundred waggons, then the Bodisat too was a caravan leader, the
lord of five hundred waggons. So in that case too they were both on a
par <span id="fr_643"></span>[4](#fn_633.md).'

35\. \[**203**\] 'And again, when Devadatta became a king of deer, by
name Sâkha, then the Bodisat was a king of deer, by name Nigrodha. So in
that case too they were both on a par <span
id="fr_644"></span>[5](#fn_634.md).'

36\. 'And again, when Devadatta became a commander-in-chief by name
Sâkha, then the Bodisat

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

was a king, by name Nigrodha. So in that case too they were both on a
par <span id="fr_645"></span>[1](#fn_635.md).'

37\. 'And again, when Devadatta became a brahman, by name Kha*nd*ahâla,
then the Bodisat was a prince, by name *K*anda. So in that case that
Kha*nd*ahâla was the superior <span id="fr_646"></span>[2](#fn_636.md).'

38\. 'And again, when Devadatta became a king, by name Brahmadatta, then
the Bodisat was his son, the prince called Mahâ Paduma. In that case the
king had his son cast down seven times, from the precipice from which
robbers were thrown down. And inasmuch as fathers are superior to and
above their sons, in that case too it was Devadatta was the
superior <span id="fr_647"></span>[3](#fn_637.md).'

39\. 'And again, when Devadatta became a king, by name Mahâ Patâpa, then
the Bodisat was his son, Prince Dhamma-pâla; and that king had the hands
and feet and head of his son cut off. So in that case too Devadatta was
the superior <span id="fr_648"></span>[4](#fn_638.md).'

40\. 'And now again, in this life, they were in the Sâkya clan, and the
Bodisat became a Buddha, all wise, the leader of the world, and
Devadatta having left the world to join the Order founded by Him who is
above the god of gods, and having attained to the powers of Iddhi, was
filled with lust to become himself the Buddha. Come now, most venerable
Nâgasena! Is not all that I have said true, and just, and accurate?'

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

41\. 'All the many things which you, great king, have now propounded,
are so, and not otherwise.'

'Then, Nâgasena, unless black and white are the same in kind, it follows
that good and evil bear equal fruit.'

'Nay, not so, great king! Good and evil have not the same result.
Devadatta was opposed by everybody. No one was hostile to the Bodisat.
And the hostility which Devadatta felt towards the Bodisat, that came to
maturity and bore fruit in each successive birth. And so also as
Devadatta, when he was established in lordship over the world,
\[**204**\] was a protection to the poor, put up bridges and courts of
justice and rest-houses for the people, and gave gifts according to his
bent to Samanas and Brahmans, to the poor and needy and the wayfarers,
it was by the result of that conduct that, from existence to existence,
he came into the enjoyment of so much prosperity. For of whom, O king,
can it be said that without generosity and self-restraint, without
self-control and the observance of the Upasatha <span
id="fr_649"></span>[1](#fn_639.md), he can reach prosperity?

'And when, O king, you say that Devadatta and the Bodisat accompanied
one another in the passage from birth to birth, that meeting together of
theirs took place not, only at the end of a hundred, or a thousand, or a
hundred thousand births, but was in fact constantly and frequently
taking place through an immeasurable period of time <span
id="fr_650"></span>[2](#fn_640.md). For you should regard that matter in
the light of the comparison drawn by the Blessed One between the case of
the

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

purblind tortoise and the attainment of the condition of a human being.
And it was not only with Devadatta that such union took place. Sâriputta
the Elder also, O king, was through thousands of births the father, or
the grandfather, or the uncle <span id="fr_651"></span>[1](#fn_641.md), or
the brother, or the son, or the nephew, or the friend of the Bodisat;
and the Bodisat was the father, or the grandfather, or the uncle, or the
brother, or the son, or the nephew, or the friend of Sâriputta the
Elder.

'All beings in fact, O king, who, in various forms as creatures, are
carried down the stream of transmigration, meet, as they are whirled
along in it, both with pleasant companions and with disagreeable
ones-just as water whirled along in a stream meets with pure and impure
substances, with the beautiful and with the ugly.

'And when, O king, Devadatta as the god, had been himself Unrighteous,
and had led others into unrighteousness of life, he was burnt in
purgatory for an immeasurable period of time <span
id="fr_652"></span>[2](#fn_642.md). \[**205**\] But the Bodisat, who, as
the god, had been himself Righteous, and had led others into
righteousness of life, lived in all the bliss of heaven for a like
immeasurable period of time. And whilst in this life, Devadatta, who had
plotted injury against the Buddha, and had created a schism in the
Order, was swallowed up by the earth, the Tathâgata,

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

knowing all that can be known, arrived at the insight of
Buddhahood <span id="fr_653"></span>[1](#fn_643.md), and was completely set
free (from the necessity of becoming) by the destruction of all that
leads to re-existence.'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say <span
id="fr_654"></span>[2](#fn_644.md).'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma as to Devadatta's superiority to the Bodisat in
previous births.\]

 

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

### \[WOMEN'S WHILES.\]

42\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, it has been said by the Blessed One:

With opportunity, and secrecy,  
And the right woo'r, all women will go wrong--  
Aye, failing others, with a cripple even <span
id="fr_655"></span>[1](#fn_645.md)."

But on the other hand it is said: "Mahosadha's wife, Amarâ, when left
behind in the village while her husband was away on a journey, remained
alone and in privacy, and regarding her husband as a man would regard
his sovran lord, she refused to do wrong, even when tempted with a
thousand pieces <span id="fr_656"></span>[2](#fn_646.md)." Now if the first
of these passages be correct, the second must be wrong; and if the
second be right, \[**206**\] the first must be wrong. This too is a
double-edged problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.'

43\. 'It is so said, O king, as you have quoted, touching the conduct of
Amarâ, Mahosadha's wife. But the question is would she have done wrong,
on receipt of those thousand pieces, with the right man: or would she
not have done so, if she had had the opportunity, and the certainty of
secrecy, and a suitable wooer? Now, on considering the matter, that lady
Amarâ was not certain of any of these

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

things. Through her fear of censure in this world the opportunity seemed
to her not fit, and through her fear of the sufferings of purgatory in
the next world. And because she knew how bitter is the fruit of
wrong-doing, and because she did not wish to lose her loved one, and
because of the high esteem in which she held her husband, and because
she honoured goodness, and despised ignobleness of life, and because she
did not want to break with her customary mode of life--for all these
reasons the opportunity seemed to her not fit.

'And, further, she refused to do wrong because, on consideration, she
was not sure of keeping the thing secret from the world. \[**207**\] For
even could she have kept it secret from men, yet she could not have
concealed it from spirits <span id="fr_657"></span>[1](#fn_647.md)--even
could she have kept it secret from spirits, yet she could not have
concealed it from those recluses who have the power of knowing the
thoughts of others-even could she have kept it secret from them, yet she
could not have concealed it from those of the gods who can read the
hearts of men--even could she have kept it secret from the gods, yet she
could not have escaped, herself, from the knowledge of her sin--even
could she have remained ignorant of it herself, yet she could not have
kept it secret from (the law of the result which follows on)
unrighteousness <span id="fr_658"></span>[2](#fn_648.md). Such were the

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

various reasons which led her to abstain from doing wrong because she
could not be sure of secrecy.

'And, further, she refused to do wrong because, on consideration, she
found no right wooer. Mahosadha the wise, O king, was endowed with the
eight and twenty qualities. And which are those twenty-eight? He was
brave, O king, and full of modesty, and ashamed to do wrong, he had many
adherents, and many friends, he was forgiving, he was upright in life,
he was truthful, he was pure in word, and deed and heart <span
id="fr_659"></span>[1](#fn_649.md), he was free from malice, he was not
puffed up, he felt no jealousy <span id="fr_660"></span>[2](#fn_650.md), he
was full of energy, he strove after all good things <span
id="fr_661"></span>[3](#fn_651.md), he was popular with all men, he was
generous, he was friendly <span id="fr_662"></span>[4](#fn_652.md), he was
humble in disposition, he was free from guile, he was free from deceit,
he was full of insight, he was of high reputation, he had much
knowledge, he sought after the good of those dependent on him, his
praise was in all men's mouths, great was his wealth, and great his
fame. Such were the twenty-eight qualities, O king, with which
'Mahosadha, the wise, was endowed. And it was because she found no wooer
like unto him that she did no wrong <span
id="fr_663"></span>[5](#fn_653.md).'

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma as to the wickedness of women <span
id="fr_664"></span>[1](#fn_654.md).\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### \[ON THE FEARLESSNESS OF THE ARAHATS.\]

44\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, it was said by the Blessed One: "The Arahats
have laid aside all fear and trembling <span
id="fr_665"></span>[2](#fn_655.md)." But on the other hand when, in the
city of Râ*g*agaha, they saw Dhana-pâlaka, the man-slaying elephant,
bearing down upon the Blessed

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

\[paragraph continues\] One, all the five hundred Arahats forsook the
Conqueror and fled, one only excepted, Ânanda the Elder <span
id="fr_666"></span>[1](#fn_656.md). Now how was it, Nâgasena? Did those
Arahats run away from fear--or did they run away willing to let the
Blessed One be destroyed, and thinking: "(Our conduct) will be clear (to
him) from the way in which he himself will act <span
id="fr_667"></span>[2](#fn_657.md)," \[**208**\] or did they run away with
the hope of watching the immense and unequalled mighty power which the
Tathâgata would exhibit? If, Nâgasena, what the

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Blessed One said as to the Arahats being devoid
of fear be true, then this story must be false. But if the story be
true, then the statement that the Arahats have put away fear and
trembling must be false. This too is a double-edged problem now put to
you, and you have to solve it.'

45\. 'The Blessed One did say, O king, that Arahats have put away all
fear and trembling, and five hundred Arahats, save only Ânanda, did, as
you say, run away when the elephant Dhana-pâlaka bore down upon the
Tathâgata that day in Râ*g*agaha. But that was neither out of fear, nor
from willingness to let the Blessed One be destroyed. For the cause by
which Arahats could be made to fear or tremble has been destroyed in
them, and therefore are they free from fear or trembling. Is the broad
earth, O king, afraid at people digging into it, or breaking it up, or
at having to bear the weight of the mighty oceans and the peaked
mountain ranges?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'But why not?'

'Because there is no cause in the broad earth which could produce fear
or trembling.'

'Just so, O king. And neither is there any such cause in Arahats. And
would a mountain peak be afraid of being split up, or broken down, or
made to fall, or burnt with fire?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'But why not?' \[**209**\]

'The cause of fear or trembling does not exist within it.'

'And just so, O king, with Arahats. If all the creatures of various
outward form in the whole

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

universe <span id="fr_668"></span>[1](#fn_658.md) were, together, to attack
one Arahat in order to put him to fear, yet would they bring about no
variation in his heart. And why? Because there is neither condition nor
cause for fear (in him, whence fear could arise). Rather, O king, was it
these considerations that arose in the minds of those Arahats: "To-day
when the best of the best of men, the hero among conquerors, has entered
into the famous city, Dhana-pâlaka the elephant will rush down the
street. But to a certainty the brother who is his special attendant will
not forsake him who is above the god of gods. But if we should not go
away, then neither will the goodness of Ânanda be made manifest, nor
will the elephant actually approach <span
id="fr_669"></span>[2](#fn_659.md) the Tathâgata. Let us then withdraw.
Thus will great masses of the people attain to emancipation from the
bonds of evil, and the goodness of Ânanda be made manifest." It was on
the realisation of the fact that those advantages would arise from their
doing so, that the Arahats withdrew to every side.'

'Well, Nâgasena, have you solved the puzzle. That is so. The Arahats
feared not, nor did they tremble. But for the advantages that they
foresaw they withdrew on every side.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the problem as to the panic of the Arahats.\]

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

### \[ON CAUSING THE OMNISCIENT ONE TO CHANGE HIS MIND.\]

46\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, your people say that the Tathâgata is all
wise <span id="fr_670"></span>[1](#fn_660.md). And on the other hand they
say: "When the company of the members of the Order presided over by
Sâriputta and Moggallâna had been dismissed by the Blessed One <span
id="fr_671"></span>[2](#fn_661.md), then the Sâkyas of Kâtumâ and Brahmâ
Sabanipati, by means of the parables of the seed and of the calf, gained
the Buddha over, and obtained his forgiveness, and made him see the
thing in the right light <span id="fr_672"></span>[3](#fn_662.md)." Now how
was that, Nâgasena? Were those two parables unknown to him that he
should be \[**210**\] appeased and gained over to their side, and
brought to see the matter in a new light? But if he did not already know
them, then, Nâgasena, he was not all-wise. If he did know them, then he
must have dismissed those brethren rudely and violently <span
id="fr_673"></span>[4](#fn_663.md) in order to try them; and therein is his
unkindness made manifest. This too is a double-edged problem now put to
you, and you have to solve it.'

47\. 'The Tathâgata, O king, was all-wise, and yet, pleased at those
parables, he was gained over by them, he granted pardon to the brethren
he had sent

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

away, and he saw the matter in the light (in which the intercessors on
their behalf wished him to see it). For the Tathâgata, O king, is lord
of the Scriptures. It was with parables that had been first preached by
the Tathâgata himself <span id="fr_674"></span>[1](#fn_664.md) that they
conciliated him, pleased him, gained him over, and it was on being thus
gained over that he signified his approval (of what they had said). It
was, O king, as when a wife conciliates, and pleases, and gains over her
husband by means of things that belong to the husband himself; and the
husband signifies his approval thereof. Or it was, O king, as when the

greater length than the Pâli, giving the full religious life history of
the famous disciple (pp. 250, 251).

<span id="fn_555"></span>[264:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_564.md) From the
A<u>n</u>guttara Nikâya III, 124 (vol. i, p. 283 of Dr. Morris's edition

<span id="fn_556"></span>[264:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_565.md) In the Vinaya
(Mahâvagga II, 16, 8) it is laid down that the Pâtimokkha (the rules of
the Order) is not to be recited before laymen. I know of no passage in
the Pi*t*akas which says that it, or the Vinaya, is to be kept secret.

<span id="fn_557"></span>[265:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_566.md) This is, so far as
I know, the earliest mention of this being the case. There is nothing in
the Pâtimokkha itself (see my translation of this list of offences
against the rules of the Order in vol. i of the 'Vinaya Texts' in the S.
B. E.) as to its recitation taking place in secret, and nothing in the
Vinaya as to its being kept secret. But the regulations in the Vinaya as
to the recitation of the Pâtimokkha forbade the actual presence of any
one not a member of the Order, and as a matter of fact any one not such
a member is excluded in practice during its recitation now in Ceylon.
But it would be no offence in a layman to read the Vinaya, and learned
laymen who have left the Order still do so.

<span id="fn_558"></span>[265:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_567.md) Va*m*sa (repeated
in the Si*m*halese).

<span id="fn_560"></span>[265:4](sbe3515.htm#fr_569.md) Kha*tt*iyâna*m*
(but the Si*m*halese has Sakyayangê).

<span id="fn_561"></span>[266:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_570.md) There are twenty
classes of these people mentioned in the text, and the meaning of most
of the names is obscure. The Si*m*halese simply repeats them all, adding
only the word bhaktiyo, 'believers in,' to the names of the various
divinities. The classing together of jugglers, ballet-dancers, and
followers of the numerous mystic cults, so numerous in India, is
thoroughly Buddhistic, and quite in the vein of Gotama himself--as, for
instance, in the Mahâ Sîla (see my 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 196).

<span id="fn_562"></span>[267:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_571.md) Added from the
Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[267:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_572.md)
Ni*gg*ita-kamma-surâ, rendered in the Si*m*halese (p. 254),
*g*aya-g*ri*hita-k*ri*tya-surâ-pânayen.

<span id="fn_564"></span>[267:3](sbe3515.htm#fr_573.md) It will be noticed
that there is no mention here (in a connection where, if it had then
existed, it would almost certainly have been referred to) of any
Esoteric Buddhism. So above, at <span id="page_268">p. 268</span> IV, 1,
8, it is stated that a good Buddhist teacher should keep nothing secret
from his pupil. And even in so old a text as the 'Book of the Great
Decease' (Chap. II, § 32, p. 36 of my [translation](errata.htm#2.md) in the
Buddhist Suttas'), it is said of the Buddha himself that he had 'no such
thing as the closed fist of a teacher who keeps some things back.' This
passage is itself quoted above at IV, 2, 4, as the basis of one of
Milinda's questions; and is entirely accepted by Nâgasena, that is, by
our author. The fact is that there has never been any such thing as
esoteric teaching in Buddhism, and that the modern so called esoteric
Buddhism is neither esoteric nor Buddhism. Its tenets, so far as they
are Indian at all, are perfectly accessible, are well known to all those
who choose to study the books of Indian mysticism, and are Hindu, not
Buddhist. They are, indeed, quite contradictory to Buddhism, of which
the authors of what they ignorantly call Esoteric Buddhism know but very
little--that little being only a portion of those beliefs which have
been common ground to all religious teachers in India. If one
doctrine--more than any other--is distinctive of Buddhism, it is the
ignoring, in ethics, of the time-honoured belief in a soul--that is, in
the old sense, in a separate creature inside the body, which flies out
of it, like a bird out of a cage, when the body dies. Yet the
Theosophists, who believe, I am told, in seven souls inside each human
body (which would be worse according to true Buddhism than seven
devils), still venture to call themselves Buddhists, and do not see the
absurdity of their position!

<span id="fn_565"></span>[268:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_574.md)
Sampa*g*âna-musâvâda pârâ*g*ikâ. This is curious as according to the
Pâtimokkha it is Pâ*k*ittiya, not Pârâ*g*ikâ. Compare Pârâ*g*ikâ 4 with
Pâ*k*ittiya 1. ('Vinaya Texts,' S. B. E., vol. iii, pp. 5 and 32.)

<span id="fn_566"></span>[269:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_575.md) I cannot trace
these identical words in the Pi*t*aka texts. But the general sense of
them is exactly in agreement with the first Pâ*k*ittiya rule.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[269:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_576.md) Hîna*t*i-kumburê
here inserts a summary of the Introductory Story (in the Sutta
Vibha<u>n</u>ga) to the 4th Pârâ*g*ikâ. All this (pp. 254-256) stands in
his version for lines 1-3 on p. 193 of the Pâli text.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[269:3](sbe3515.htm#fr_577.md) The Pâli repeats
them word for word. As I have pointed out above, they are not really
correct.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[269:4](sbe3515.htm#fr_578.md) So
Hîna*t*i-kumburê, who must have had a different reading, and I think a
better one, before him.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[269:5](sbe3515.htm#fr_579.md) A kahâpa*n*a. See
the discussion of the value of this coin in my 'Ancient Coins and
Measures,' pp. 3, 4.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[270:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_580.md) Yâva sîsa*m*
ka*l*îra*kkh*e*gg*a*m* *kh*edipeyyâma, which the Si*m*halese merely
repeats. It is literally 'We should have him "bambû-sprout-cut" up to
his head.' What this technical term may mean is not exactly
known--possibly having slits the shape of a bambû sprout cut all over
his body.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[270:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_581.md)
Dhammatâ-dhamma-pariyâye. I don't know where this is to be found.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[271:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_583.md) These eight
Investigations (Vilokanâni) have not yet been found in the Pi*t*aka
texts. But, when relating the birth of the historical Buddha, the
*G*âtaka commentary (vol. i, p. 48, of Professor Fausböll's edition)
mentions the first six of them (substituting okâsa for desa), and calls
them, oddly enough, the Five Great Investigations. In the corresponding
passage in the Lalita Vistara only the first four are mentioned. The
last two of the above eight seem very forced.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[271:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_584.md) Nimesantaram na
âgameti, for which Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p. 256 at the end) has nivesantara.
Neither word occurs elsewhere.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[272:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_585.md) Âyum oloketvâ,
which the Si*m*halese (p. 257) repeats. This implied meaning is
doubtful.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[272:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_586.md) Uttara-setu, a word
which does not occur elsewhere. Hîna*t*i-kumburê renders it He-da*nd*a,
which Clough explains as a footbridge usually made of a single tree.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[273:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_587.md) Literally 'is not
to throw himself down,' and I think 'from a precipice' is to be
understood, especially as the nearest approach to the words quoted, that
is the passage in the Sutta Vibha<u>n</u>ga on the 3rd Pârâ*g*ika (III,
5, 13), has that meaning.

<span id="fn_578"></span>[273:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_588.md) Here again the
passage referred to is not known.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[274:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_589.md) Sattâna*m*, in
which gods are included.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[274:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_590.md) The four oghas;
also called Âsavas. The former term is used of them objectively, the
latter subjectively.

<span id="fn_581"></span>[275:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_591.md) This Kumâra Kassapa
is said at A<u>n</u>guttara I, xiv, 3 to have been the most eloquent of
the early disciples. Another eloquent little outburst of his is
preserved for us in verses 201 and 202 of the Therâ Gâthâ. 'O for the
Buddhas, and their doctrines! O for the achievements of our Master!
Thereby may the disciple realise the Truth. Through countless æons of
time has Selfness followed on Selfness. But this one is now the last.
This aggregation (of mental and material qualities which forms me now
again into an individuality) is at last the end, the end of the coming
and going of births and deaths. There will be no rebirth for me!' But
where the verses are so full of allusions to the deepest Buddhist
psychology, it is impossible to reproduce in English the vigour of the
original Pâli. Selfness (Sakkâya) is the condition of being a separate
individual.

<span id="fn_582"></span>[275:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_592.md) All this is from
the celebrated discourse, the 'Foundation of the Kingdom of
Righteousness' (in 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 148).

Paligha-parivattika*m*.

<span id="fn_595"></span>[277:6](sbe3515.htm#fr_605.md)
Palâla-pî*th*aka*m*. I follow throughout Hîna*t*i-kumburê's
interpretation (pp. 260, 261) of these pretty names, which could be well
matched in the West. That some Indian kings were cruel in the extreme is
no doubt true. But it must not be supposed that this list gives the
names of well-known punishments. It is merely a string of technical
terms which is repeated by rote whenever tortures have to be specified.
And the meaning of its terms was most likely unknown to the very people
who so used them. For the whole list (which is taken by our author from
the Pâli Pi*t*akas) is explained by Buddhaghosa in his commentary, the
Manoratha Pûranî, on A<u>n</u>guttara III, 1, 1, as edited by Dr. Morris
at pp. 113, 114 of the first edition of his A<u>n</u>guttara for the
Pâli Text Society, 1884. But Buddhaghosa's explanations differ from
Hîna*t*i-kumburê's in several details; and to nearly half the names he
gives alternative meanings, quite contradictory to those that he gives
first. So the list had its origin some centuries (say 400-500) B.C., and
was certainly <span id="page_278">p. 278</span> not understood in the
fifth century A. D.; and was probably therefore unintelligible also, at
least in part, to our author.

<span id="fn_596"></span>[278:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_606.md)
Ûmika-va<u>n</u>ka-*k*adika. I don't pretend to understand this last
word. Dr. Morris, at p. 92 of the 1 Pâli Text Society's journal' for
1884, suggests velika. Perhaps it was simply adika after all, with or
without *m* euphonic.

<span id="fn_597"></span>[279:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_607.md) This same string of
words, except the first, is used of the Iddhi-pâdas in the Book of the
Great Decease, III, 3 (p. 40 of vol. xi of the S. B. E). The words
'towards all beings' are not in the text. But this is the meaning of the
phrase used, and not love to men only, as would be understood if they
were not inserted in the translation.

<span id="fn_598"></span>[279:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_608.md) Amanussa. This
means, not the gods, but the various spirits on the earth, nayads,
dryads, fairies, &c. &c. As here, so again below, IV, 4, 41, the
amanussâ are opposed to the devatâ, mentioned in the next clause here.
In older texts the devatâ include the amanussâ.

<span id="fn_599"></span>[279:3](sbe3515.htm#fr_609.md) From the
A<u>n</u>guttara Nikâya, Ekâdasa Nipâta; quoted in full, with the
context, in the Introductory Story to the 169th *G*âtaka (vol. ii, pp.
60, 61 of Professor Fausböll's edition).

<span id="fn_600"></span>[280:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_610.md) Mr. Trenckner
points out that this story is given in the 540th *G*âtaka.

<span id="fn_601"></span>[280:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_611.md) See p. 105 of the
text.

<span id="fn_602"></span>[280:3](sbe3515.htm#fr_612.md) *K*akkhu*m* dehi.
So also p. 95 of the text.

<span id="fn_603"></span>[280:4](sbe3515.htm#fr_613.md) Nibbâhana; not in
Childers, but see p. 119 of the text.

<span id="fn_604"></span>[281:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_614.md) Bhânanâ is really
more than 'cultivation.' It is the actual, present, felt sense of the
particular moral state that is being cultivated (in this case, of love).
I have elsewhere rendered it 'meditation': but as the ethical doctrine,
and practice, are alike unknown to us, we have no word that exactly
reproduces the connotation of the Pâli phrase.

<span id="fn_605"></span>[282:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_615.md) This is no quibble.
The early Buddhists did believe in the power of a subjective love over
external circumstances. It is true that the best known instances in
which this power is represented as having been actually exercised, are
instances of the power of love over the hearts of other beings, and
hence, indirectly, over their actions. Thus when Devadatta had had the
fierce, manslaying elephant Nâlâgiri let loose against the Buddha
(*K*ullavagga VII, 3, 11, 12), Gotama is said to have permeated him with
his love, and the elephant then went up to him only to salute him, and
allowed himself to be stroked, and did no harm. And when the five
disciples had intended, when he went to Benares, to show him no respect,
the Buddha, in like manner, is said to have 'concentrated that feeling
of his love which was able to pervade generally all beings in earth and
heaven,' and to have 'directed it specially towards them.' Then 'the
sense of his love diffused itself through their hearts. And as he came
nearer and nearer, unable any longer to adhere to their resolve, they
rose from their seats, and bowed down before him, and welcomed him with
every mark of reverence and of respect' ('Buddhist Birth Stories,' vol.
i, p. 112).

And when he wished to convert Ro*g*a the Mallian, the Buddha is said, in
like manner, to have 'suffused him with the feeling of his love.' And
then Roga, 'overcome by the Blessed One by the sense of his love--just
as a young calf follows the kine, so did he go from apartment to
apartment' seeking the Blessed One (Mahâvagga VI, 36, 4).

And again, when the Bhikkhus told the Buddha of a brother having been
killed by a snake-bite, he is represented (in the *K*ullavagga V, 6) to
have said: 'Now surely that brother had not let his love flow out over
the four royal kinds of serpents. Had he done so, he would not have died
of the bite of a snake.' And then he is said to have enjoined the use of
a poem of love to snakes (set out in the text quoted) as a safeguard
against snake-bite. This goes really much further than the other
instances, but no case is given of that safeguard having been actually
used successfully. And I know of no case in the Pâli Pi*t*akas of the
felt presence <span id="page_283">p. 283</span> of the feeling of love
being said to have actually counteracted either fire, or poison, or
sword.

It is noteworthy that the Si*m*halese inserts here six pages (265-271)
of matter not found in the Pâli. But as it gives at length the story of
Prince Sâma, it is taken, I presume, from the *G*âtaka book.

<span id="fn_606"></span>[283:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_616.md) This is something
quite different from what was said before.

<span id="fn_607"></span>[283:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_617.md) Ye
vi*ññ*ana-baddhâ, sabbesa*m*, which the Si*m*halese takes as a gloss on
'good and evil ones,' and renders vi*ññ*âna prati wû da. But I prefer
Mr. Trenckner's punctuation.

<span id="fn_608"></span>[283:3](sbe3515.htm#fr_618.md) That is to a
temporary life in heaven.

<span id="fn_609"></span>[283:4](sbe3515.htm#fr_619.md) That is to life in
a temporary hell (or purgatory).

<span id="fn_610"></span>[284:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_620.md) Bodhi-satto
(Wisdom-Child). The individual who (through virtue practised in
successive lives) was becoming the Buddha.

<span id="fn_611"></span>[284:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_621.md) 'Wicked' and 'pure'
are in the Pâli ka*n*he and sukka, literally, 'dark' and light.' The
only other passage I recollect where these names of colours are used in
an ethical sense is the 87th verse of the Dhammapada. Professor Max
Müller there renders: 'A wise man should leave the dark state (of
ordinary life), and follow the bright state (of the Bhikshu),' (S. B.
E., Vol. X, p. 26.) But the words should certainly be translated: 'A
wise man should put away wicked dispositions, and cultivate purity of
heart.' Bhâvetha could never refer to adopting or following any outward
profession. It is exclusively used of the practice, cultivation, of
inward feelings. And the commentary, which is quoted by Professor
Fausböll, takes the passage in the Dhammapada in that sense, just as
Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p. 271) does here.

<span id="fn_612"></span>[284:3](sbe3515.htm#fr_622.md) Bhave bhave, which
would be more accurately rendered 'in the course of his gradual
becoming.'

<span id="fn_613"></span>[284:4](sbe3515.htm#fr_623.md) Kavaka-ka*nd*âla.
The Ka*nd*âlas are a well-known caste still existing in India--if indeed
that can rightly be called a caste which is beneath all others.
*Kh*avaka is not in Childers, but is applied below (p. 256 of our text)
to Mâra, the Buddhist Satan. See also the next note.

<span id="fn_614"></span>[284:5](sbe3515.htm#fr_624.md) This is not a
summary of the 309th *G*âtaka, for it differs from that story as
published by Professor Fausböll (vol. iii, pp. <span id="page_285">p.
285</span> 217-30), and also from the older and shorter version
contained in the Old Commentary on the Pâtimokkha (on the 69th Sakhiya,
Vinaya IV, pp. 203, 204). \[The name of that story in Professor
Fausböll's edition is Khavaka-*G*âtaka, but throughout the story itself
the word Ka*nd*âla is used in the passages corresponding to those in
which Professor Fausböll has *Kh*apaka (sic),--a coincidence which
throws light on our author, *Kh*avaka-ka*nd*âla.\] The story here
referred to is the Amba *G*âtaka (No. 474) in which the word Khavaka
does not occur.

<span id="fn_615"></span>[285:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_625.md) 'Of Magadha,' says
Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p. 272).

<span id="fn_616"></span>[285:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_626.md) This is the 122nd
*G*âtaka, there called the Dummedha *G*âtaka. The king has the elephant
taken to the top of the Vepulla mountain outside Râ*g*agaha. Then having
made him stand first on three feet, then on two, then on one, he demands
of the trainer to make him stand in the air. Then the elephant flies
away to Benares!

<span id="fn_617"></span>[285:3](sbe3515.htm#fr_627.md) Pavane
na*tth*âyiko. But as Hîna*t*i-kumburê renders all this: 'a farmer in
Benares who gained his living by husbandry,' I would suggest pavanena
*tth*âyiko as the right reading.

<span id="fn_618"></span>[286:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_628.md) I cannot
unfortunately trace this story among the *G*âtakas.

<span id="fn_619"></span>[286:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_629.md) I do not know which
*G*âtaka is here referred to.

<span id="fn_620"></span>[286:3](sbe3515.htm#fr_630.md) This must be the
438th *G*âtaka, there called the Tittira *G*âtaka. In the summary
Devadatta is identified with the hypocritical ascetic who killed and ate
the wise partridge.

<span id="fn_621"></span>[286:4](sbe3515.htm#fr_631.md) This is the 313th
*G*âtaka, there called the Khanti-vadi *G*âtaka. The royal sportsman has
first the skin, and then the hands and feet of the sage cut off to alter
his opinions. But the sage simply says that his love to animals is not
in his skin, or in his limbs, but in his heart. Then the earth swallows
up the cruel monarch, and the citizens bury the body of the sage with
all honour. In the summary Kalâbu, the king, is identified with
Devadatta.

<span id="fn_622"></span>[287:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_632.md) This is the 222nd
*G*âtaka, there called the Kûla Nandiya *G*âtaka.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[287:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_633.md) This is probably
the 518th *G*âtaka. See Mr. Trenckner's note.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[287:3](sbe3515.htm#fr_634.md) This must be the
492nd *G*âtaka, the Takkha-sûkara *G*âtaka, in which the hero is a
learned pig who helps the carpenter in his work, and the villain of the
story is a hypocrite ascetic with matted hair. But it should be added
that though in the summary (Fausböll, vol. iv, p. 350) Devadatta is
identified with the ascetic, the Bodisat is identified, not with the
learned pig, but with the dryad.

<span id="fn_625"></span>[287:4](sbe3515.htm#fr_635.md) He is called
Upa*k*ara both in the 422nd *G*âtaka (of which this is a summary) and in
the Sumangala (p. 258). The *G*âtaka (III, 454) also gives a third
variation, Apa*k*ara.

<span id="fn_626"></span>[287:5](sbe3515.htm#fr_636.md) Purisamatto gagane
vehâsa<u>n</u>gamo. The *G*âtaka says simply upari*k*aro, which must
mean about the same.

<span id="fn_627"></span>[288:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_637.md) This must be the
482nd *G*âtaka. It is true that the man is there called Mahâ Dhanaka
(Fausböll, vol. iii, p. 255), and the Bodisat is not specially named
Ruru, nor is he a king of the herd, but is only a stag of the kind of
deer called Ruru, who alone. But a comparison of the poetical version of
the same story in the *K*ariyâ Pi*t*aka II, 6 (p. 87 of Dr. Morris's
edition for the Pâli Text Society) shows that the same story is here
referred to.

<span id="fn_628"></span>[288:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_638.md) This is the 72nd
*G*âtaka, the Sîlava Nâga *G*âtaka. (Fausböll, vol. i, p. 319.)

<span id="fn_629"></span>[288:3](sbe3515.htm#fr_639.md) Khattiya-dhammo;
literally, 'who had the nature of a Kshatriya.' This expression is not
found in the *G*âtaka referred to, No. 241 (Vol. ii, p. 242 and foll. in
Professor Fausböll's edition), and the Bodisat is there called purdhita
not pa*nd*ita, and his name is not given as Vidhura. The jackal also
came to grief in his attempt to conquer Benares. But there is no doubt
as to that story, the Sabba Dâ*th*a *G*âtaka being the one here quoted.

<span id="fn_630"></span>[289:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_640.md) This is the 357th
*G*âtaka (Fausböll, vol. iii, pp. 174) and which is one of those
illustrated on the Bharhut Tope (Cunningham, Plate 109).

<span id="fn_631"></span>[289:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_641.md) In the *G*âtaka
text (No. 457, Fausböll, vol. iv, pp. 100 and foll.), there are both
devaputtâ, 'gods,' not yakkhâ. This is by no means the only instance of
the term yakkha being used of gods.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[289:3](sbe3515.htm#fr_642.md) I cannot trace this
story in the printed text of the *G*âtakas.

<span id="fn_633"></span>[289:4](sbe3515.htm#fr_643.md) This is the
Apa*nn*aka *G*âtaka (No. i, vol. i, pp. 98 and foll. in Professor
Fausböll's edition), translated in the 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' vol. i,
pp. 138-145.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[290:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_646.md) I cannot trace this
story among the published *G*âtakas.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[290:3](sbe3515.htm#fr_647.md) This is the Mahâ
Paduma *G*âtaka (No. 472, Fausböll, vol. iv, pp. 187-195). It was a case
of Joseph and Potiphar's wife.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[290:4](sbe3515.htm#fr_648.md) This tragical story
is No. 358 in the *G*âtaka collection (Fausböll, vol. iii, pp. 177-182).

<span id="fn_639"></span>[291:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_649.md) The Buddhist
Sabbath, on which see my 'Manual of Buddhism,' pp. 139-141.

<span id="fn_640"></span>[291:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_650.md) So also above, IV,
2, 64, and IV, 3, 28.

<span id="fn_641"></span>[292:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_651.md) That is 'father's
younger brother.' The Pâli has no word for uncle generally, the whole
scheme of relationship being different from ours, and the various sorts
of uncles having, in the Pâli scheme, different and distinct names.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[292:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_652.md) 'Fifty-seven
ko*t*is and sixty hundreds of thousands of years,' says the text, with
touching accuracy.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[293:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_653.md) So
Hîna*t*i-kumburê, who takes sabbadhamme as accusative to bu*ggh*itvâ,
and understands the phrase as above translated.

<span id="fn_644"></span>[293:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_654.md) This discussion is
very interesting, both as a specimen of casuistry, and as an exposition
of orthodox Buddhist belief. And it is full of suggestion if taken as a
statement of the kind of reason which led the Buddhist editors of the
earlier folk-lore to identify Devadatta with the characters referred to
by king Milinda. But the facts are that those editors, in using the old
stories and legends for their ethical purposes, always identified
Devadatta with the cruel person in the story, and paid no heed to the
question whether be was superior or not in birth or in the consideration
of the world, to the person they identified with the Bodisat. In
searching through the four volumes of the published *G*âtakas, and the
proof-sheets of the fifth volume with which Professor Fausböll has
favoured me, for the purpose of tracing the stories referred to by our
author, I find that Devadatta appears in sixty-four of them, and that in
almost every one of these sixty-four he is either superior in birth, or
equal to the character identified with the Bodisat. This is not
surprising, for it is not unusually the superiors in birth who are
guilty of the kind of cruelty and wickedness which the Buddhist editors
would ascribe to Devadatta. So that our author, had he chosen to do so,
might have adduced many other instances of a similar kind to those he
actually quotes. I add in an appendix the full list of the Devadatta
stories in the *G*âtakas. It is clear our author had before him a
version of the *G*âtaka book slightly different from our own, as will be
seen from the cases pointed out in the notes in which, as to names or
details, the story known to him differs from the printed text. And also
that here (as at III, 6, 2) he would have been able to solve his own
dilemma much better if he had known more of the history of those sacred
books on the words of which it is based.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[294:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_655.md) It is not meant
that men would not. But that is too clear to be even worthy of mention,
whereas with regard to women the question is worth discussion. Our
author is mistaken in ascribing this verse to the Buddha. It is only
found (as has been pointed out by Mr. Trenckner) in a *G*âtaka story,
No. 536, and is a specimen, not of Buddhist teaching, but of Indian
folk-lore. There is a very similar sentiment in *G*âtaka, No. 62 (vol.
i, p. 289).

<span id="fn_646"></span>[294:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_656.md) This story will be
found in the Ummagga *G*âtaka, No. 546.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[295:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_657.md) Fairies, nayad,
dryads, &c. &c.--not gods.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[295:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_658.md) Adhammena raho na
labheyya. I am in great doubt as to the real meaning of these words,
which Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p. 286) renders merely adharmayen rahasak no
labannê. They look very much like a kind of personification of Karma.
The phrase is really very parallel to the saying in Numbers xxxii. 23,
'Be sure your sin will find you out'--namely, in its results--and is as
true ethically as it is difficult grammatically.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[296:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_659.md) So*k*eyya-sampanno,
which Hîna*t*i-kumburê renders suva*k*a gu*n*ayen samanwibawa: that is,
'compliant, attentive to what is said.' But I prefer to take the
expression in the sense explained at length in A<u>n</u>guttara III,
119. See also *G*âtaka I, 214; Milinda, p. 115.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[296:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_660.md) Anusuyyako. See
*G*âtaka II, 192, and Milinda, p. 94.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[296:3](sbe3515.htm#fr_661.md) Âyûhako.
Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p. 286) renders this word, which is only found here,
by Dhana piris rœs kirîm œtteya, 'one who has heaped up goods and men.'
But see Milinda, p. 181, and Dr. Morris in the Pâli Text Society's
journals for 1885 and 1886.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[296:4](sbe3515.htm#fr_662.md) Sakhilo, 'kindly in
speech,' says the Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[296:5](sbe3515.htm#fr_663.md) This is all very
well, but it does not confirm, it explains away, the supposed quotation
from the Buddha's words.

<span id="fn_654"></span>[297:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_664.md) The position of
women in India, at the time when Buddhism arose, was, theoretically,
very low. The folk tales are full of stories turning on the wiles of
women, and the Hindoo law-books seem never tired of the theme of her
uncleanness, her weakness, and her wickedness. But, except in matters of
property, the bark was I think worse than the bite. Among the people, in
the homes of the peasantry, the philippics of the Brahmin priests were
not much regarded, and the women led lives as pleasant as those of their
male relations, and shared in such mental and physical advantages as
their male relations enjoyed. The influence of Buddhism must have been
felt in two directions. In the first place the importance attached to
the celibate life must have encouraged the kind of view taken of women
among Catholics in mediaeval times (the Brahmin view being much akin to
those that were promulgated by Luther). On the other hand the fact that
women were admitted to the Order, and that the still higher aim of
Arahatship was held to be attainable by them, must have helped to
encourage a high esteem for women. We have many instances of women who
were credited with the insight of Arahatship. A whole treatise in the
Buddhist sacred books, the Theri Gâtha, is devoted to hymns and poems
ascribed to them, and many of these reach a very high level of
intelligent and spiritual emotion.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[297:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_665.md) I do not know the
exact passage referred to, but there are many of similar tendency in the
sacred books. See, for instance, Dhammapada, verses 39, 188, 214, 351,
and 385; and Sutta Nipâta, verses 15, 70, 212, 621, and 965.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[298:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_666.md) Here again we have
a variation between our author's words and those of the Pi*t*akas. In
the *K*ullavagga VII, 3, 11, 12 (translated in pp. 247-250 of vol. iii
of the 'Vinaya Texts' in the 'Sacred Books of the East'), we have the
oldest versions of this story; and there the elephant is called, not
Dhana-pâlaka, but Nâlâgiri, and the number of attendant disciples (who
are not called Arahats) is not given as five hundred. The Buddha is
simply said to have entered Râ*g*agaha 'with a number of Bhikkhus.'
Nothing also is said, either of their running away, or of Ânanda's
remaining behind. It is, no doubt, an easily explicable and very pretty
alteration of the story, which exhibits Ânanda, the beloved disciple, as
acting in this way. But it is none the less an alteration.

It should be added that Nâlâgiri (it should be Nâ*l*âgiri) in the Vinaya
text is a personal name of the elephant, but may be derived from its
place of origin. (See the references to a famous elephant named
Nâ*l*âgiri in the Megha Dûta and Na*d*âgiri in the Kathâ Sarit Sâgara
XI, 42, XII, 10, XIII, 7, 29. But Pâ*n*ini VI, 3, 117, gives the latter
as the name of a mountain.) So while there may be a variation in the
legend, it may also be that we have only two names for the same
elephant, just as one might speak of the Shetland pony (named) Brownie.
And the stanza quoted below (p. 410 of the Pâli text) shows that the
name Dhana-pâlaka was given already in older texts to the Nâ*l*âgiri
elephant.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[298:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_667.md) Pa*ññ*âyissati
sakena kammena, 'It will be plain to the Buddha (that is, he will be
able to judge of our motives) from his own kindness and goodness,'
according to the Si*m*halese (p. 287). But the expression is a very
strange one, and perhaps, after all, it merely means, 'The matter will
turn out according to his Karma.'

<span id="fn_658"></span>[300:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_668.md) Literally, 'In the
hundreds of thousands of world systems.'

<span id="fn_659"></span>[300:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_669.md)
A*tth*ânam-anavakâsataya, Because of the absence of condition and
opportunity.'

<span id="fn_660"></span>[301:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_670.md) This question is
also discussed above, III, 6, 2.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[301:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_671.md) This episode has
already been referred to above, and will be found set out in full in the
*K*âtumâ Sutta, No. 67, in the Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya (pp. 456-462 of Mr.
Trenckner's edition for the Pâli Text Society).

<span id="fn_662"></span>[301:3](sbe3515.htm#fr_672.md) Ni*ggh*atta*m*
aka*m*su. Compare *G*âtaka, vol. i, p. 495.

<span id="fn_663"></span>[301:4](sbe3515.htm#fr_673.md) Okassa pasayha,
which the Si*m*halese (p. 289) renders âka*ddh*anaya kola abhibhavanaya
karanâ. See Dr. Morris in the 'Journal of the Pâli Text Society,' 1887,
p. 148.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[302:1](sbe3515.htm#fr_674.md) This is quite
correct. They are in the fourth book of the A<u>n</u>guttara Sutta, No.
13.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[302:2](sbe3515.htm#fr_675.md) Pa*n*aka, a word
only found in this passage. Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p. 280 at the end) renders
it ran panâwen.

<span id="fn_666"></span>[302:3](sbe3515.htm#fr_676.md) Other cruxes
arising out of the dogma of the Buddha's omniscience are discussed
above, III, 6, 2.
