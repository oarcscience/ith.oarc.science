### BOOK IV. CHAPTER 3.

### \[PRECEDENCE OF THE DHARMA.\]

1\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, it was said by the Blessed One: "For it is the
Dhamma, O Vâsettha, which is 'the best in the world <span
id="fr_463"></span>[1](#fn_454.md),' as regards both what we now see, and
what is yet to come <span id="fr_464"></span>[2](#fn_455.md)." But again
(according to your people) the devout layman who has entered the
Excellent Way, for whom the possibility of rebirth in any place of woe
has passed away, who has attained to insight, and to whom the doctrine
is known, even such a one ought to salute and to rise from his seat in
token of respect for, and to revere, any member of the Order, though a
novice, and though he be unconverted <span
id="fr_465"></span>[3](#fn_456.md). Now if the Dhamma be the best that rule
of conduct is wrong, but if that be right then the first statement must
be wrong.

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

\[paragraph continues\] This too is a double-pointed problem. It is now
put to you, and you have to solve it.' \[**162**\]

2\. 'The Blessed One said what you have quoted, and you have rightly
described the rule of conduct. But there is a reason for that rule, and
that is this. There are these twenty personal qualities, making up the
Samanaship of a Samana, and these two outward signs <span
id="fr_466"></span>[1](#fn_457.md), by reason of which the Samana is worthy
of salutation, and of respect, and of reverence. And what are they? The
best form of self-restraint, the highest kind of self-control <span
id="fr_467"></span>[2](#fn_458.md), right conduct, calm manners <span
id="fr_468"></span>[3](#fn_459.md), mastery over (his deeds and words <span
id="fr_469"></span>[4](#fn_460).md), subjugation (of his senses <span
id="fr_470"></span>[5](#fn_461).md), long-suffering <span
id="fr_471"></span>[6](#fn_462.md), sympathy <span
id="fr_472"></span>[7](#fn_463.md),

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

the practice of solitude <span id="fr_473"></span>[1](#fn_464.md), love of
solitude <span id="fr_474"></span>[2](#fn_465.md), meditation <span
id="fr_475"></span>[3](#fn_466.md), modesty and fear of doing wrong <span
id="fr_476"></span>[4](#fn_467.md), zeal <span
id="fr_477"></span>[5](#fn_468.md), earnestness <span
id="fr_478"></span>[6](#fn_469.md), the taking upon himself of the
precepts <span id="fr_479"></span>[7](#fn_470.md), recitation (of the
Scriptures) <span id="fr_480"></span>[8](#fn_471.md), asking questions (of
those wise in the Dhamma and Vinaya), rejoicing in the Sîlas and other
(rules of morality), freedom from attachment (to the things of the
world), fulfilment of the precepts--and the wearing of the yellow robe,
and the being shaven. \[**163**\] In the practice of all these things
does the member of the Order live. By being deficient in none of them,
by being perfect in all, accomplished in all, endowed with all of them
does he reach forward to the condition of Arahatship, to the condition
of those who have nothing left to learn; he is marching towards the
highest of all lands <span id="fr_481"></span>[9](#fn_472.md). Thus it is
because he sees him to be in the company of the Worthy Ones (the
Arahats) that the layman who has already entered on the Excellent Way
thinks it worthy in him <span id="fr_482"></span>[10](#fn_473.md) to

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

reverence and to show respect to the Bhikkhu, though [he](errata.htm#0.md)
may be, as yet, unconverted. It is because he sees him to be in the
company of those in whom all evil has been destroyed, because he feels
that he is not in such society <span id="fr_483"></span>[1](#fn_474.md),
that the converted layman thinks it worthy of him to do reverence and to
show respect to the unconverted Bhikkhu. It is because he knows that he
has joined the noblest brotherhood, and that he himself has reached no
such state, that the converted layman holds it right to do reverence and
to show respect to the unconverted Bhikkhu--because he knows that he
listens to the recitation of the Pâtimokkha, while he himself can
not--because he knows that he receives men into the Order, and thus
extends the teaching of the Conqueror, which he himself is incapable of
doing--because he knows that he carries out innumerable precepts, which
he himself cannot observe--because he knows that he wears the outward
signs of Sama*n*aship, and carries out the intention of the Buddha,
while he himself is gone away far from that--because he knows that he,
though he has given up his hair and beard, and is unanointed and wears
no ornaments, yet is anointed with the perfume of righteousness, while
he is himself addicted to jewelry and fine apparel--that the converted
layman thinks it right to do reverence, and to show respect to the
unconverted Bhikkhu.'

3\. 'And moreover, O king, it is because he knows that not only are all
these twenty personal qualities which go to make a Sama*n*a, and the two
outward signs, found in the Bhikkhu, but that he carries them

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

on, and trains others in them, that the converted layman, realising that
he has no part in that tradition <span id="fr_484"></span>[1](#fn_475.md),
in that maintenance of the faith, thinks it right to reverence and to
show respect to the converted Bhikkhu. \[**164**\] Just, O king, as a
royal prince who learns his knowledge, and is taught the duties of a
Khattiya, at the feet of the Brahman who acts as family chaplain <span
id="fr_485"></span>[2](#fn_476.md), when after a time he is anointed king,
pays, reverence and respect to his master in the thought of his being
the teacher, and the carrier on of the traditions of the family, so is
it right for the converted Bhikkhu to do reverence and to pay respect to
the unconverted Bhikkhu.'

4\. 'And moreover, O king, you may know by this fact the greatness and
the peerless glory of the condition of the Bhikkhus--that if a layman, a
disciple of the faith, who has entered upon the Excellent Way, should
attain to the realisation of Arahatship, one of two results must happen
to him, and there is no other--he must either die away on that very day,
or take upon himself the condition of a Bhikkhu. For immovable, O king,
is that state of renunciation, glorious, and most exalted--I mean the
condition of being a member of the Order!'

'Venerable Nâgasena, this subtle problem has been thoroughly unravelled
by your powerful and great wisdom. No one else could solve it so unless
he were wise as you.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the problem as to the precedence of the Dharma\]

 

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

### \[THE HARM OF PREACHING.\]

5\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, you Bhikkhus say that the Tathâgata averts harm
from all beings, and does them good <span
id="fr_486"></span>[1](#fn_477.md). And again you say that when he was
preaching the discourse based on the simile of the burning fire <span
id="fr_487"></span>[2](#fn_478.md) hot blood was ejected from the mouths of
about sixty Bhikkhus. By his delivery of that discourse he did those
Bhikkhus harm and not good. So if the first statement is correct, the
second is false; and if the second is correct, the first \[**165**\] is
false. This too is a double-pointed problem put to you, which you have
to solve.'

6\. 'Both are true. What happened to them was not the Tathâgata's doing,
but their own.'

'But, Nâgasena, if the Tathâgata had not delivered that discourse, then
would they have vomited up hot blood?'

'No. When they took wrongly what he said, then was there a burning
kindled within them, and hot blood was ejected from their mouths.'

'Then that must have happened, Nâgasena, through the act of the
Tathâgata, it must have been the Tathâgata who was the chief cause <span
id="fr_488"></span>[3](#fn_479.md) to destroy them. Suppose a serpent,
Nâgasena, had crept into an anthill, and a man in want of earth were to
break into the anthill, and take the earth of it away. And by his doing
so the entrance-hole to the anthill

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

were closed up, and the snake were to die in consequence from want of
air. Would not the serpent have been killed by that man's action?'

'Yes, O king.'

'Just so, Nâgasena, was the Tathâgata the prime cause of their
destruction.'

7\. 'When the Tathâgata delivered a discourse, O king, he never did so
either in flattery or in malice. In freedom both from the one and from
the other did he speak. And they who received it aright were made
wise <span id="fr_489"></span>[1](#fn_480.md), but they who received it
wrongly, fell. Just, O king, as when a man shakes a mango tree or a
jambu tree or a mee tree <span id="fr_490"></span>[2](#fn_481.md), such of
the fruits on it as are full of sap and strongly fastened to it remain
undisturbed, but such as have rotten stalks, and are loosely attached,
fall to the ground--\[**166**\] so was it with his preaching. It was, O
king, as when a husbandman, wanting to grow a crop of wheat, ploughs the
field, but by that ploughing many hundreds and thousands of blades of
grass are killed--or it was as when men, for the sake of sweetness,
crush sugarcane in a mill, and by their doing so such small creatures as
pass into the mouth of the mill are crushed also--so was it that the
Tathâgata making wise those whose minds were prepared, preached the
Dhamma without flattery and without malice. And they who received it
aright were made wise, but they who received it wrongly, fell.'

8\. Then did not those Bhikkhus fall, Nâgasena, just because of that
discourse?'

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

'How, then, could a carpenter by doing nothing to a piece of timber, and
simply laying it by <span id="fr_491"></span>[1](#fn_482.md), make it
straight and fit for use?'

'No, Sir. He would have to get rid of the bends out of it, if he wanted
it straight and ready for use.'

'Just so, O king, the Tathâgata could not, by merely watching over his
disciples, have opened the eyes of those who were ready to see. But by
getting rid of those who took the word wrongly he saved those prepared
to be saved. And it was by their own act and deed, O king, that the
evil-minded fell; just as a plantain tree, or a bambû, or a she-mule are
destroyed by that to which they themselves give birth <span
id="fr_492"></span>[2](#fn_483.md). And just, O king, as it is by their own
acts that robbers come to have their eyes plucked out, or to impalement,
or to the scaffold, just so were the evil-minded destroyed by their own
act, and fell from the teaching of the Conqueror.'

9\. 'And so \[**167**\] with those sixty Bhikkhus, they fell neither by
the act of the Tathâgata nor of any one else, but solely by their own
deed <span id="fr_493"></span>[3](#fn_484.md). Suppose, O king, a man were
to give ambrosia <span id="fr_494"></span>[4](#fn_485.md) to all the
people, and they, eating of it, were to become healthy and long-lived
and free from every bodily ill. But one man, on eating it, were by his
own bad digestion, to

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

die. Would then, O king, the man who gave away the ambrosia be guilty
therein of any offence?'

'No, Sir.'

'Just so, O king, does the Tathâgata present the gift of his ambrosia to
the men and gods in the ten thousand world systems; and those beings who
are capable of doing so are made wise by the nectar of his law, while
they who are not are destroyed and fall. Food, O king, preserves the
lives of all beings. But some who eat of it die of cholera <span
id="fr_495"></span>[1](#fn_486.md). Is the man who feeds the hungry guilty
therein of any offence?'

'No, Sir.'

'Just so, O king, does the Tathâgata present the gift of his ambrosia to
the men and gods in the ten thousand world systems; and those beings who
are capable of doing so are made wise by the nectar of his law, while
they who are not are destroyed and fall.'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma on the harm resulting from preaching.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### \[THE SECRETS OF A TATHÂGATA.\]

11\. \[This dilemma treats of one of the thirty bodily signs of a 'great
man' (Mahâpurusha) supposed to be possessed by every Tathâgata, but as
it deals with matters not usually spoken of in this century, it is best
read in the original.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### \[THE FOOLISH FELLOW.\]

15\. \[**170**\] 'Venerable Nâgasena, it was said by the Elder
Sâriputta, the commander of the faith: "The

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Tathâgata, brethren, is perfect in courtesy of
speech. There is no fault of speech in the Tathâgata concerning which he
should have to take care that no one else should know it <span
id="fr_496"></span>[1](#fn_487.md)." And on the other hand the Tathâgata,
when promulgating the first Pârâ*g*ika on the occasion of the offence of
Sudinna the Kalanda <span id="fr_497"></span>[2](#fn_488.md), addressed him
with harsh words, calling him a useless fellow <span
id="fr_498"></span>[3](#fn_489.md). And that Elder, on being so called,
terrified with the fear of his teacher <span
id="fr_499"></span>[4](#fn_490.md), and overcome with remorse, was unable
to comprehend the Excellent Way <span id="fr_500"></span>[5](#fn_491.md).
Now if the first statement be correct, the allegation that the Tathâgata
called Sudinna the Kalanda a useless fellow must be false. But if that
be true, then the first statement must be false. \[**171**\] This too is
a double-pointed problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.'

16\. 'What Sâriputta the Elder said is true, O king. And the Blessed One
called Sudinna a useless fellow on that occasion. But that was not out
of rudeness of disposition <span id="fr_501"></span>[6](#fn_492.md), it was
merely pointing out the real nature (of his conduct) in a way that would
do him no harm <span id="fr_502"></span>[7](#fn_493.md). And what herein is
meant by

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "pointing out the real nature." If any man, O
king, in this birth does not attain to the perception of the Four
Truths, then is his manhood (his being born as a man) in vain <span
id="fr_503"></span>[1](#fn_494.md), but if he acts differently he will
become different. Therefore is it that he is called a useless
fellow <span id="fr_504"></span>[2](#fn_495.md). And so the Blessed One
addressed Sudinna the Kalanda with words of truth, and not with words
apart from the facts.'

17\. 'But, Nâgasena, though a man in abusing another speaks the truth,
still we should inflict a small <span id="fr_505"></span>[3](#fn_496.md)
fine upon him. For he is guilty of an offence, inasmuch as he, although
for something real, abused him by the use of words that might lead to a
breach (of the peace) <span id="fr_506"></span>[4](#fn_497.md).'

'Have you ever heard, O king, of a people bowing down before, or rising
up from their seats in respect for, or showing honour to, or bringing
the complimentary presents (usually given to officials) to a criminal?'

'No, if a man have committed a crime of whatever sort or kind, if he be
really worthy of reproof and punishment, they would rather behead him,
or torture

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

him <span id="fr_507"></span>[1](#fn_498.md), or bind him with bonds, or
put him to death, or deprive him of his goods <span
id="fr_508"></span>[2](#fn_499.md).'

'Did then the Blessed One, O king, act with justice or not?'

'With justice, Sir, and in a most fit and proper way. And when,
Nâgasena, they hear of it the world of men and gods will be made tender
of conscience, and afraid of falling into sin, struck with awe at the
sight of it, and still more so when they themselves associate with
wrong-doers, or do wrong.'

18\. \[**172**\] 'Now would a physician, O king, administer pleasant
things as a medicine in a case where all the humours of the body were
affected, and the whole frame was disorganised and full of disease?'

'No. Wishing to put an end to the disease he would give sharp and
scarifying drugs.'

'In the same way, O king, the Tathâgata bestows admonition for the sake
of suppressing all the diseases of sin. And the words of the Tathâgata,
even when stern, soften men and make them tender. Just as hot water, O
king, softens and makes tender anything capable of being softened, so
are the words of the Tathâgata, even when stern, yet as full of benefit,
and as full of pity as the words of a father would be to his children.
Just, O king, as the drinking of evil-smelling decoctions, the
swallowing of nasty drugs, destroys the weaknesses of men's bodies, so
are the words of the Tathâgata even when stern, bringers of advantage
and laden with pity. And

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

just, O king, as a ball of cotton falling on a man raises no bruise, so
do the words of the Tathâgata, even when stern, do no harm.'

'Well have you made this problem clear by many a simile, Very good,
Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[End of the dilemma as to the Buddha's harsh words to Sudinna.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### \[THE TREE TALKING.\]

19\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, the Tathâgata said:

"Brahman! why do you ask an unconscious thing,  
Which cannot hear you, how it does to-day?  
Active, intelligent, and full of life,  
How can you speak to this so senseless thing-  
This wild Palâsa tree <span id="fr_509"></span>[1](#fn_500.md)?"

\[**173**\] And on the other hand he said:

"And thus the Aspen tree then made reply:  
'I, Bhâradvâ*g*a, can speak too. Listen to me <span
id="fr_510"></span>[2](#fn_501.md).'"

'Now if, Nâgasena, a tree is an unconscious thing, it must be false that
the Aspen tree spoke to Bhâradvâ*g*a. But if that is true, it must be
false to say that a tree is unconscious. This too is a double-edged
problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.'

20\. The Master said, Nâgasena, that a tree is unconscious. And the
Aspen tree conversed with Bhâradvâ*g*a. But that last is said, O king,
by a common form of speech. For though a tree being unconscious cannot
talk, yet the word "tree" is used

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

as a designation of the dryad who dwells therein, and in that sense that
"the tree talks" is a well-known expression. just, O king, as a waggon
laden with corn is called a corn-waggon. But it is not made of corn, it
is made of wood, yet because of the corn being heaped up in it the
people use the expression "corn-waggon." Or just, O king, as when a man
is churning sour milk the common expression is that he is churning
butter. But it is not butter that he is churning, but milk. Or just, O
king, as when a man is making something that does not exist the common
expression is that he is making that thing which all the while as yet is
not, \[**174**\] but people talk of the work as accomplished before it
is done. And the Tathâgata, when expounding the Dhamma, does so by means
of the phraseology which is in common use among the people.'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma as to the talking tree.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### \[THE BUDDHA'S LAST ILLNESS.\]

21\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, it was said by the Elders who held the
Recitation <span id="fr_511"></span>[1](#fn_502.md):

"When he had eaten *K*unda's alms,  
The coppersmith's,--thus have I heard,--  
The Buddha felt that sickness dire,  
That sharp pain even unto death <span id="fr_512"></span>[2](#fn_503.md)."

 

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

\[paragraph continues\] And afterwards the Blessed One said: "These two
offerings of food, Ânanda, equal, of equal fruit, and of equal result,
are of much greater fruit and much greater result than any others <span
id="fr_513"></span>[1](#fn_504.md)." Now if sharp sickness fell upon the
Blessed One, Nâgasena, after he had partaken of Kunda's alms, and sharp
pains arose within him even unto death, then that other statement must
be wrong. But if that is right then the first must be wrong. How could
that alms, Nâgasena, be of great fruit when it turned to poison, gave
rise to disease, \[**175**\] put an end to the period of his then
existence, took away his life? Explain this to me to the refutation of
the adversaries. The people are in bewilderment about this, thinking
that the dysentery must have been caused by his eating too much, out of
greediness.'

22\. 1 The Blessed One said, O king, that there were two almsgivings
equal, of equal fruit, and equal result, and of much greater fruit, and
much greater result than any others,--that which, when a Tathâgata has
partaken of it, he attains to supreme and perfect Buddhahood
(Enlightenment), and that when he has partaken of which, he passes away
by that utter passing away in which nothing whatever remains
behind <span id="fr_514"></span>[2](#fn_505.md). For that alms is full of
virtue, full of advantage. The gods, O king, shouted in joy and gladness
at the thought: "This is the last meal the Tathâgata will take," and
communicated a divine power of nourishment to that tender

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

pork <span id="fr_515"></span>[1](#fn_506.md). And that was itself in good
condition, light, pleasant, full of flavour, and good for
digestion <span id="fr_516"></span>[2](#fn_507.md). It was not because of
it that any sickness fell upon the Blessed One, but it was because of
the extreme weakness of his body, and because of the period of life he
had to live having been exhausted, that the disease arose, and grew
worse and worse--just as when, O king, an ordinary fire is burning, if
fresh fuel be supplied, it will burn up still more--or \[**176**\] as
when a stream is flowing along as usual, if a

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

heavy rain falls, it will become a mighty river with a great rush of
water--or as when the body is of its ordinary girth, if more food be
eaten, it becomes broader than before. So this was not, O king, the
fault of the food that was presented, and you can not impute any harm to
it.'

23\. 'But, venerable Nâgasena, why is it that those two gifts of food
are so specially meritorious?'

'Because of the attainment of the exalted conditions which resulted from
them <span id="fr_517"></span>[1](#fn_508.md).'

'Of what conditions, Nâgasena, are you speaking?'

'Of the attainment of the nine successive states which were passed
through at first in one order, and then in the reverse order <span
id="fr_518"></span>[2](#fn_509.md).'

'It was on two days, was it not, Nâgasena, that the Tathâgata attained
to those conditions in the highest degree?'

'Yes, O king <span id="fr_519"></span>[3](#fn_510.md).'

'It is a most wonderful thing, Nâgasena, and a most strange, that of all
the great and glorious gifts which were bestowed upon our Blessed
One <span id="fr_520"></span>[4](#fn_511.md) not one can be compared with
these two almsgivings. Most marvellous is it, that even as those

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

nine successive conditions are glorious, even so are those gifts made,
by their glory, \[**177**\] of greater fruit, and of greater advantage
than any others. Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you
say.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma as to the Buddha's last illness.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### \[ADORATION OF RELICS.\]

24\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, the Tathâgata said: "Hinder not yourselves,
Ânanda, by honouring the remains of the Tathâgata <span
id="fr_521"></span>[1](#fn_512.md)." And on the other hand he said:

"Honour that relic of him who is worthy of honour,  
Acting in that way you go from this world to heaven <span
id="fr_522"></span>[2](#fn_513.md)."

'Now if the first injunction was right the second must be wrong, and if
the second is right the first must be wrong. This too is a double-edged
problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.'

25\. 'Both the passages you quote were spoken by the Blessed One. But it
was not to all men, it was to the sons of the Conqueror <span
id="fr_523"></span>[3](#fn_514.md) that it was said: "Hinder not
yourselves, Ânanda, by honouring the remains of the Tathâgata <span
id="fr_524"></span>[4](#fn_515.md)". Paying reverence is not the work of
the sons of the Conqueror, \[**178**\] but rather the grasping of the
true nature of all

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

compounded things, the practice of thought, contemplation in accordance
with the rules of Satipa*tth*âna, the seizing of the real essence of all
objects of thought, the struggle against evil, and devotion to their own
(spiritual) good. These are things which the sons of the Conqueror ought
to do, leaving to others, whether gods or men, the paying of
reverence <span id="fr_525"></span>[1](#fn_516.md).'

26\. 'And that is so, O king, just as it is the business of the princes
of the earth to learn all about elephants, and horses, and chariots, and
bows, and rapiers, and documents, and the law of property <span
id="fr_526"></span>[2](#fn_517.md), to carry on the traditions of the
Khattiya clans, and to fight themselves and to lead others in war, while
husbandry, merchandise, and the care of cattle are the business of other
folk, ordinary Vessas and Suddas.--Or just as the business of Brahmins

of meteors, earthquakes, conflagrations, and signs in the heavens and on
the earth, the study of arithmetic, of casuistry,

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

of the interpretation of the omens to be drawn from dogs, and deer, and
rats, and mixtures of liquids, and the sounds and cries of birds-while
husbandry, merchandise, and the care of cattle are the business of other
folk, ordinary Vessas and Suddas. So it was, O king, in the sense of
"Devote not yourselves to such things as are not your business, but to
such things as are so" that the Tathâgata was speaking \[**179**\] when
he said: "Hinder not yourselves, Ânanda, by honouring the remains of the
Tathâgata." And if, O king, he had not said so, then would the Bhikkhus
have taken his bowl and his robe, and occupied themselves with paying
reverence to the Buddha through them <span
id="fr_529"></span>[1](#fn_520.md)!'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma as to reverence to relics.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### \[THE SPLINTER OF ROCK.\]

27\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, you Bhikkhus say that: "When the Blessed One
walked along, the earth, unconscious though it is, filled up its deep
places, and made its steep places plain <span
id="fr_530"></span>[2](#fn_521.md)." And on the other hand you say that a
splinter of

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

rock grazed his foot <span id="fr_531"></span>[1](#fn_522.md). When that
splinter was falling on his foot why did it not, then, turn aside? If it
be true that the unconscious earth makes its deep places full and its
steep places plain for him, then it must be untrue that the splinter of
rock hurt his foot. But if the latter statement be true, then the first
must be false. This too is a double-edged problem now put to you, and
you have to solve it.'

28\. 'Both statements, O king, are true. But that splinter of rock did
not fall of itself <span id="fr_532"></span>[2](#fn_523.md), it was cast
down through the act of Devadatta. Through hundreds of thousands of
existences, O king, had Devadatta borne a grudge against the Blessed
One <span id="fr_533"></span>[3](#fn_524.md). It was through that hatred
that he seized hold of a mighty mass of rock, and pushed it over with
the hope that it would fall upon the Buddha's head. But two other rocks
came together, and intercepted it before it reached the Tathâgata, and
by the force of their impact a splinter was torn off, and fell in such a
direction that it struck \[**180**\] the Blessed One's foot.'

29\. 'But, Nâgasena, just as two rocks intercepted that mighty mass, so
could the splinter have been intercepted.'

'But a thing intercepted, O king, can escape, slip through, or be
lost--as water does, through the fingers, when it is taken into the
hand--or milk, or buttermilk, or honey, or ghee, or oil, or fish curry,

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

or gravy--or as fine, subtle, minute, dusty grains of sand do, through
the fingers, if you close your fist on them--or as rice will escape
sometimes when you have taken it into your fingers, and are putting it
into your mouth.'

30\. 'Well, let that be so, Nâgasena. I admit that the rock was
intercepted. But the splinter ought at least to have paid as much
respect to the Buddha as the earth did.'

'There are these twelve kinds of persons, O king, who pay no
respect--the lustful man in his lust, and the angry man in his malice,
and the dull man in his stupidity, and the puffed-up man in his pride,
and the bad man in his want of discrimination, and the obstinate man in
his want of docility, and the mean man in his littleness, and the
talkative man in his vanity, and the wicked man in his cruelty, and the
wretched man in his misery, and the gambler \[**181**\] because he is
overpowered by greed, and the busy man in his search after gain. But
that splinter, just as it was broken off by the impact of the rocks,
fell by chance <span id="fr_534"></span>[1](#fn_525.md) in such a direction
that it struck against the foot of the Blessed One--just as fine,
subtle, and minute grains of sand, when carried away by the force of the
wind, are sprinkled down by chance in any direction they may happen to
take. If the splinter, O king, had not been separated from the rock of
which it formed a part, it too would have been intercepted by their
meeting together. But, as it was, it was neither fixed on the earth, nor
did it remain stationary in the air, but fell whithersoever

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

chance directed it, and happened to strike against the Blessed One's
foot--just as dried leaves might fall if caught up in a whirlwind. And
the real cause of its so striking against his foot was the
sorrow-working deed <span id="fr_535"></span>[1](#fn_526.md) of that
ungrateful, wicked, Devadatta.'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma as to the splinter grazing the Buddha's foot.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### \[THE SAMA*N*A.\]

31\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, the Blessed One said: "A man becomes a
Sama*n*a by the destruction of the Âsavas <span
id="fr_536"></span>[2](#fn_527.md)." But on the other hand he said:

"The man who has these dispositions four  
Is he whom the world knows as Sama*n*a <span
id="fr_537"></span>[3](#fn_528.md)."

And in that passage these are the four dispositions referred
to--long-suffering, temperance in food, renunciation <span
id="fr_538"></span>[4](#fn_529.md), and the being without the
attachments <span id="fr_539"></span>[5](#fn_530.md) (arising from lust,
ill-will, and dulness). Now these four dispositions are equally found in
those who are still defective, in whom \[**182**\] the

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Âsavas have not yet been completely destroyed.
So that if the first statement be correct, the second is wrong, and if
the second be right the first must be wrong. This too is a double-edged
problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.'

32\. 'Both statements, O king, were made by the Blessed One. But the
second was said of the characteristics of such and such men; the first
is an inclusive statement--that all in whom the Âsavas are destroyed are
Sama*n*as. And moreover, of all those who are made perfect by the
suppression of evil, if you take them in regular order one after the
other, then the Sama*n*a in whom the Âsavas are destroyed is
acknowledged to be the chief--just, O king, as of all flowers produced
in the water or on the land, the double jasmine <span
id="fr_540"></span>[1](#fn_531) is [acknowledged](errata.htm#1.md) to be
the chief, all other kinds of flowers of whatever sort are merely
flowers, and taking them in order it is the double jasmine that people
most desire and like. Or just, O king, as of all kinds of grain, rice is
acknowledged to be the chief, all other kinds of grain, of whatever
sort, \[183\] are useful for food and for the support of the body, but
if you take them in order, rice is acknowledged as the best.'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma as to what constitutes a Sama*n*a.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

### \[THE BUDDHA'S EXULTATION.\]

33\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, the Blessed One said: "If, O Bhikkhus, any one
should speak in praise of me, or of our religion (Dhamma), or of the
Order, you should not thereupon indulge in joy, or delight, or
exultation of mind <span id="fr_541"></span>[1](#fn_532.md)". And on the
other hand the Tathâgata was so delighted, and pleased, and exultant at
the deserved praise bestowed on him by Sela the Brahman, that he still
further magnified his own goodness in that he said:

"A king am I, Sela, the king supreme  
Of righteousness. The royal chariot wheel  
In righteousness do I set rolling on--  
That wheel that no one can turn back again <span
id="fr_542"></span>[2](#fn_533.md)!"

Now if the passage first quoted be right then must the second be wrong,
but if that be right then must the first be wrong. This too is a
double-edged problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.'

34\. \[**184**\] 'Both your quotations, O king, are correct. But the
first passage was spoken by the Blessed One with the intention of
setting forth truthfully, exactly, in accordance with reality, and fact,
and

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

sense, the real nature, and essence, and characteristic marks of the
Dhamma. And the second passage was not spoken for the sake of gain or
fame, nor out of party spirit, nor in the lust of winning over men to
become his followers. But it was in mercy and love, and with the welfare
of others in view, conscious that thereby three hundred young Brahmans
would attain to the knowledge of the truth, that he said: "A king am I,
Sela, the king supreme of righteousness."'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the problem as to exultation of mind.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### \[KINDNESS AND PUNISHMENT.\]

35\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, the Blessed One said:

"Doing no injury to any one  
Dwell full of love and kindness in the world <span
id="fr_543"></span>[1](#fn_534.md)."

And on the other hand he said: "Punish him who deserves punishment <span
id="fr_544"></span>[2](#fn_535.md), favour him who is worthy of favour."
\[**185**\] Now punishment, Nâgasena, means the cutting off of hands or
feet, flogging <span id="fr_545"></span>[3](#fn_536.md), casting into
bonds, torture <span id="fr_546"></span>[4](#fn_537.md), execution,
degradation in rank <span id="fr_547"></span>[5](#fn_538.md).

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Such a saying is therefore not worthy of the
Blessed One, and he ought not to have made use of it. For if the first
injunction be right then this must be wrong, and if this be right then
the injunction to do no injury to any one, but to dwell full of love and
kindness in the world, must be wrong. This too is a double-edged problem
now put to you, and you have to solve it.'

36\. 'The Blessed One, great king, gave both the commands you quote. As
to the first, to do no injury to any one, but to live full of love and
kindness in the world--that is a doctrine approved by all the Buddhas.
And that verse is an injunction, an unfolding of the Dhamma, for the
Dhamma has as its characteristic that it works no ill. And the saying is
thus in thorough accord with it. But as to the second command you quote
that is a special use of terms \[which you have misunderstood. The real
meaning of them is: "Subdue that which ought to be subdued, strive
after, cultivate, favour what is worthy of effort, cultivation, and
approval"\]. The proud heart, great king, is to be subdued, and the
lowly heart cultivated--the wicked heart to be subdued, and the good
heart to be cultivated--carelessness of thought is to. be subdued, and
exactness of thought to be cultivated--\[**186**\] he who is given over
to wrong views is to be subdued, and he who has attained to right views
is to be cultivated--he who is not noble <span
id="fr_548"></span>[1](#fn_539.md) is to be subdued, and the noble one is

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

to be cultivated--the robber <span id="fr_549"></span>[1](#fn_540.md) is to
be subdued, and the honest brother is to be cultivated.'

37\. 'Let that be so, Nâgasena. But now, in that last word of yours, you
have put yourself into my power, you have come round to the sense in
which I put my question. For how, venerable Nâgasena, is the robber to
be subdued by him who sets to work to subdue him?'

'Thus, great king--if deserving of rebuke let him be rebuked, if of a
fine let him be fined, if of banishment let him be banished, if of death
let him be put to death.'

'Is then, Nâgasena, the execution of robbers part of the doctrine laid
down by the Tathâgatas?'

'Certainly not, O king.'

'Then why have the Tathâgatas laid down that the robber is to be taught
better?'

'Whosoever, great king, may be put to death, he does not suffer
execution by reason of the opinion put forth by the Tathâgatas. He
suffers by reason of what he himself has done. But notwithstanding that
the doctrine of the Dhamma has been taught (by the Buddhas) <span
id="fr_550"></span>[2](#fn_541.md), would it be possible, great king, for a
man who had done nothing wrong, and was walking innocently along the
streets, to be seized and put to death by any wise person?'

'Certainly not.'

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

'But why?'

'Because of his innocence.'

'Just so, great king, since the thief is not put to death through the
word of the Tathâgata, but only through his own act, how can any fault
be rightly found on that account with the Teacher?'

'It could not be, Sir.'

'So you see the teaching of the Tathâgatas is a righteous teaching.'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the problem as to kindness and punishment.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### \[THE DISMISSAL OF THE ELDERS.\]

38\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, it was said by the Blessed One:

"Anger I harbour not, nor sulkiness <span
id="fr_551"></span>[1](#fn_542.md)."

But on the other hand the Tathâgata dismissed the Elders Sâriputta and
Moggallâna, together with the brethren who formed their company of
disciples <span id="fr_552"></span>[2](#fn_543.md).

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

\[paragraph continues\] How now, Nâgasena, \[**187**\] was it in anger
that the Tathâgata sent away <span id="fr_553"></span>[1](#fn_544.md) the
disciples, or was it in pleasure? Be so good as to explain to me how
this was <span id="fr_554"></span>[2](#fn_545.md). For if, Nâgasena, he
dismissed them in anger, then had the Tathâgata not subdued all
liability to anger in himself. But if it was in pleasure, then he did so
ignorantly, and without due cause. This too is a double-edged problem
now put to you, and you have to solve it.'

39\. 'The Blessed One did say, O king:

"Anger I harbour not, nor sulkiness."

And he did dismiss the Elders with their disciples. But that was not in
anger. Suppose, O king, that a man were to stumble against some root, or
stake, or stone, or potsherd, or on uneven ground, and fall upon the
broad earth. Would it be that the broad earth, angry with him, had made
him fall?'

'No, indeed, Sir. The broad earth feels neither anger against any man
nor delight. It is altogether

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

free from ill-will, neither needs it to fawn on any one. It would be by
reason of his own carelessness that that man stumbled and fell.'

'Just so, great king, do the Tathâgatas experience neither anger
against, nor pride in any man. Altogether free are the Tathâgatas, the
Arahat-Buddhas, alike from ill-will, and from the need to fawn on any
one. And those disciples were sent away by reason of what they
themselves had done. So also the great ocean endures not association
with any corpse. Any dead body there may be in it that does it promptly
cast up, and leave high and dry on the shore <span
id="fr_555"></span>[1](#fn_546.md). But is it in anger that it casts it
up?'

'Certainly not, Sir. The broad ocean feels neither anger against any,
nor does it take delight in any. It seeks not in the least to please
any, and is altogether free from the desire to harm.'

'Just so, great king, do the Tathâgatas feel neither anger against any
man, nor do they place their faith in any man. The Tathâgatas, the
Arahat-Buddhas, are quite set free from the desire either to gain the
goodwill of any man, or to do him harm, And it was by reason of what
they themselves had done that those disciples were sent away. Just as a
man, great king, who stumbles against the ground is made to fall, so is
he who stumbles in the excellent teaching of the Conqueror made to go
away. just as a corpse in the great ocean is cast up, \[**188**\] so is
he who stumbles in the excellent teaching of the Conqueror sent away.
And when the Tathâgata sent those disciples away it was for their good,
and their

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

gain, their happiness, and their purification, and in order that in that
way they should be delivered from birth, old age, disease, and death.'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_454"></span>[229:1](sbe3514.htm#fr_463.md) This is a quotation
from a celebrated verse, which is, as it were, the national anthem of
those who, in the struggle for religious and ceremonial supremacy
between the Brahmans and the nobles, took the side of the nobles (the
Khattiyas). As might be expected it is not seldom found in the Buddhist
Suttas, and is often put in the mouth of the Buddha, the most
distinguished of these Khattiyas who were transcendental rather than
military. It runs: 'The Khattiya is the best in the world of those who
observe the rules of exogamous marriage, but of the whole race of men
and gods he who has wisdom and righteousness is the best.' See, for
instance, the Amba*tth*a Sutta, in the Dîgha Nikâya, and the
Suma<u>n</u>gala Vilâsinî on that passage. By 'best in the world' is
meant 'entitled to take precedence before all others,' not best in the
moral sense.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[229:2](sbe3514.htm#fr_464.md) From the Agga*ññ*a
Sutta in the Dîgha Nikâya.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[229:3](sbe3514.htm#fr_465.md) I cannot give any
authority for this, but it is no doubt correct Buddhism according to the
spirit of the Pi*t*akas.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[230:2](sbe3514.htm#fr_467.md) Aggo niyamo.
Hîna*t*i-kumburê takes agga in the sense of Arahatship: 'Niwan dena

<span id="fn_459"></span>[230:3](sbe3514.htm#fr_468.md) Vihâra, which the

'Because he is docile and pleasant of speech,' says the Si*m*halese:
'Suwa*k*a kîkaru bhâwayen yukta bawa.' It is an abstract noun formed
from surata, and does not occur in Sanskrit, though Böhtlingk-Roth give
one authority for it (under sauratya) from a Buddhist work, the
Vyutpatti. It is one of the many instances in which the Buddhist ethics
has put new and higher meaning into current phrases, for in Sanskrit
literature surata (literally 'high pleasure') is used frequently enough,
but almost without exception in an obscene sense. The commentary on
*G*âtaka III, 442 only repeats the word. It is there, as here, and in
the Vyutpatti, and at A<u>n</u>guttara II, 15, 3, always allied with
khanti. My translation follows Childers--(who probably follows
Böhtlingk-Roth); but the Si*m*halese gloss here makes me very doubtful
as to the exact connotation which the early Buddhists associated with
'high pleasure.'

<span id="fn_491"></span>[238:5](sbe3514.htm#fr_500.md) There is nothing in
the Vinaya account of this result.

<span id="fn_492"></span>[238:6](sbe3514.htm#fr_501.md) Du*tth*a-*k*ittena,

<span id="fn_495"></span>[239:2](sbe3514.htm#fr_504.md) Mogha-puriso, the
same word as I have translated elsewhere 'foolish fellow,' following
Childers. But I never think that the word means always and only 'in
vain, useless.' See *G*âtaka I, 14; III, 24, 25; Sutta Nipâta III, 7,
20; Mahâvagga VIII, 1, 5; *K*ullavagga V, 1, 3; A<u>n</u>guttara II, 5,

where the verses are ascribed to the Buddha.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[242:1](sbe3514.htm#fr_511.md) The Council of
Râ*g*agaha is meant, at which the Pi*t*akas were recited. All the
so-called Councils are exclusively 'Recitations' (Sa*m*gîtiyo) in
Buddhist phraseology. But 'Council' is the best rendering of the word,
as Recitation implies so much that would be unintelligible to the
ordinary reader.

<span id="fn_503"></span>[242:2](sbe3514.htm#fr_512.md) Book of the Great
Decease, IV, 23.

<span id="fn_504"></span>[243:1](sbe3514.htm#fr_513.md) Book of the Great

<span id="fn_505"></span>[243:2](sbe3514.htm#fr_514.md) Book of the Great
Decease, loc. cit. The Si*m*halese gives the whole context in full.

<span id="fn_506"></span>[244:1](sbe3514.htm#fr_515.md) Sûkara-maddava.
There is great doubt as to the exact meaning of this name of the last
dish the Buddha partook of. Maddati is 'to rub,' or 'to press,' or 'to
trample,' and just as 'pressed beef' is ambiguous, so is 'boar-pressed'
or 'pork-tender' capable of various interpretations. The exegetical
gloss as handed down in the Mahâ Vihâra in Anurâdhapure, Ceylon, in the
now lost body of tradition called the Mahâ A*tth*akathâ, has been
preserved by Dhammapâla in his comment on Udâna VIII, 5 (p. 81 of Dr,
Steinthal's edition for the Pâli Text Society). It means, I think, 'Meat
pervaded by the tenderness and niceness of boar's (flesh).' But that is
itself ambiguous, and Dhammapâla adds that others say the word means not
pork or meat at all, but 'the tender top sprout of the bambû plant after
it has been trampled upon by swine'--others again that it means a kind
of mushroom that grows in ground trodden under foot by swine--others
again that it means only a particular kind of flavouring, or sauce. As
Maddana is rendered by Childers 'withered,' I have translated it in my
'Buddhist Suttas' (pp. 71-73) 'dried boar's flesh.' But the fact is that
the exact sense is not known. (Maddavâni pupphâni at Dhammapada 377 is
'withered flowers,' according to Fausböll. But it may be just as well
'tender flowers,' especially as Mârdava in Sanskrit always means
'tender, pitiful,' &c. This is the only passage where the word is known
to occur in Pâli apart from those in which sûkara-maddava is mentioned.)
The Si*m*halese here (p. 230) repeats the word and adds the gloss: E
taru*n*u wû ûru ma*m*sayehi.

Dhammânuma*gg*ana-samâpatti-varena: which the Si*m*halese merely
repeats. For Anuma*gg*anâ see the text above, [p.
62](sbe3504.htm#page_62.md), and Sumangala Vilâsinî, p. 65.

<span id="fn_509"></span>[245:2](sbe3514.htm#fr_518.md) See the full
description in the Book of the Great Decease, VI, 11-13. ('Buddhist
Suttas,' pp. 115, 116.) The Si*m*halese is here greatly expanded (pp.
230-233).

<span id="fn_510"></span>[245:3](sbe3514.htm#fr_519.md) So our author must
have thought that the nine Anupubbavihâras occurred also after the alms
given to Gotama before he sat under the Bo Tree, but I know of no
passage in the Pi*t*akas which would support this belief. Compare the
note 2 in vol. i, p. 74 of the 'Vinaya Texts,' and the passages there
quoted.

<span id="fn_511"></span>[245:4](sbe3514.htm#fr_520.md) Buddha-khette
dânam, 'gifts which had the Buddha as the field in which they were
bestowed, or sown.'

<span id="fn_512"></span>[246:1](sbe3514.htm#fr_521.md) Book of the Great
Decease, V, 24.

<span id="fn_513"></span>[246:2](sbe3514.htm#fr_522.md) Not found in any of
the Pi*t*aka texts as yet published.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[246:3](sbe3514.htm#fr_523.md) *G*ina-puttâna*m*.
That is, the members of the Order.

<span id="fn_515"></span>[246:4](sbe3514.htm#fr_524.md) Here again
Hîna*t*i-kumburê goes into a long account of the attendant circumstances
(pp. 2 33, 234).

<span id="fn_516"></span>[247:1](sbe3514.htm#fr_525.md) This is really only
an expansion and a modernisation of the context of the passage quoted.

<span id="fn_517"></span>[247:2](sbe3514.htm#fr_526.md) Lekha-muddâ. See
the note above on I, 1, 10.

<span id="fn_518"></span>[247:3](sbe3514.htm#fr_527.md) Itihâsa, 'the
Bhârata and the Râmâya*n*a,' says the Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[247:4](sbe3514.htm#fr_528.md) 'Of names of trees
and so on,' says Hîna*t*i-kumburê.

<span id="fn_520"></span>[248:1](sbe3514.htm#fr_529.md) This certainly
looks as if our author did not know anything of the worship paid to the
supposed bowl of the Buddha, or of the feast, the Patta-maha, held in
its honour. The passage may therefore be used as an argument for the
date of the book. Fâ-Hsien saw this bowl-worship in full force at
Peshawar about 400 A. D. See Chapter xii of his travels (Dr. Legge's
translation, pp. 35-37).

<span id="fn_521"></span>[248:2](sbe3514.htm#fr_530.md) Not found as yet in
the Pi*t*akas.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[249:1](sbe3514.htm#fr_531.md) *K*ullavagga VII,
3, 9. Compare the Samyutta Nikâya I, 4, 8; 1V, 2, 3 (pp. 27 and 110 of

<span id="fn_525"></span>[250:1](sbe3514.htm#fr_534.md) Animitta-kata-disâ,
which the Si*m*halese (p. 238) merely repeats.

<span id="fn_526"></span>[251:1](sbe3514.htm#fr_535.md)
Dukkhânubhâvanâ--the sorrow being Devadatta's subsequent existence in
purgatory.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[251:2](sbe3514.htm#fr_536.md) That is 'of
sensuality, individuality, delusion, and ignorance.' I don't know which
is the passage referred to.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[251:3](sbe3514.htm#fr_537.md) Also not traced as
yet in the texts.

<span id="fn_529"></span>[251:4](sbe3514.htm#fr_538.md) Vippahânâ, not in
Childers, but see Sutta Nipâta V, 14. 4, 5. Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p. 239)
renders it âlaya hœrîma.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[251:5](sbe3514.htm#fr_539.md) Âkinka*ññ*a, not
having the three ki*ñk*anas mentioned. Hîna*t*i-kumburê (p. 239) takes
it to mean the practice of the Âki*ñk*âyatana meditation. But if so that
would surely have been the word used.

<span id="fn_531"></span>[252:1](sbe3514.htm#fr_540.md) Varsikâ (Dœsaman
mal, jasminum zambac).

<span id="fn_532"></span>[253:1](sbe3514.htm#fr_541.md) From the
Brahma-*g*âla Sutta in the Dîgha Nikâya (I, 1, 5).

<span id="fn_533"></span>[253:2](sbe3514.htm#fr_542.md) From the Sela,
Sutta in the Sutta Nipâta (III, 7, 7). Professor Fausböll in his
translation of this stanza (at vol. x, p. 102 of the 'Sacred Books of
the East') draws attention to the parallel at John xviii. 37. 'Thou
sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born. And for this cause came
I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth'--where
'truth,' if one translated the verse into Pâli, would be correctly
rendered by Dhamma, 'righteousness, religion, truth, essential quality.'
Professor Fausböll's version of the stanza runs: 'I am a king, O Sela,
an incomparable religious (Dhamma-râ*g*a) king, with justice (Dhamma). I
turn the wheel, a wheel that is irresistible.'

<span id="fn_534"></span>[254:1](sbe3514.htm#fr_543.md) From the 521st
*G*âtaka.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[254:2](sbe3514.htm#fr_544.md) The crux lies in
the ambiguity of this phrase as will be seen below.

<span id="fn_536"></span>[254:3](sbe3514.htm#fr_545.md) Vadha, which is
ambiguous, and means also 'killing.' The Si*m*halese repeats the word.

<span id="fn_537"></span>[254:4](sbe3514.htm#fr_546.md) Kâra*n*â, which
Hîna*t*i-kumburê renders tœlîmaya, 'flogging.'

<span id="fn_538"></span>[254:5](sbe3514.htm#fr_547.md)
Santati-vikopana*m*, literally 'breach of continuity.' Hîna*t*i-kumburê
explains it to mean 'injury to the duration of life,' and this may be
the author's meaning, as he is fond of heaping together a string of
words, some of which mean the same thing. But as <span id="page_255">p.
255</span> santati means also 'lineage, descent,' the phrase may equally
well refer to the sort of punishment I have ventured to put into the
text.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[255:1](sbe3514.htm#fr_548.md) Ariyo and anariyo
used technically in the sense of one who has not, and one who has,
entered upon the Noble Eightfold Path.

<span id="fn_540"></span>[256:1](sbe3514.htm#fr_549.md) Coro probably here
used figuratively of a member of the Order who is unworthy of it, and
injures believing laymen. So the word is used, for instance, in the
introductory story (in the Sutta Vibhanga) to the fourth
Pârâ*g*ika--where four sorts of such religious 'robbers' are
distinguished (compare our 'wolf in sheep's clothing'). But the king
takes it literally.

<span id="fn_541"></span>[256:2](sbe3514.htm#fr_550.md) The three words in
brackets are Hîna*t*i-kumburê's gloss.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[257:1](sbe3514.htm#fr_551.md) From the Dhaniya
Sutta in the Sutta Nipâta (1, 2, 2).

<span id="fn_543"></span>[257:2](sbe3514.htm#fr_552.md) The episode here
referred to will be found in the Magghima Nikâya, No. 67.
Hîna*t*i-kumburê gives it in full. The Buddha was staying at the Âmalakî
garden near the Sâkya town called *K*âtumâ. There the two elders with
their attendant 500 disciples came to call upon him. 'The resident
Bhikkhus received them with applause, and a great hubbub arose. The
Buddha enquired what that noise was, like the chattering of fishermen
when a net full of fishes was drawn to shore. Ânanda told him. Thereupon
the Buddha called the brethren together, made a discourse to them on the
advantages of quiet, and 'sent away' the visitors. They went to the
public rest-house in the town. The town's folk enquired why, and <span
id="page_259">p. 259</span> when they heard the reason, went to the
Buddha, and obtained his forgiveness for the offending brethren. The
incident is the basis of another question below, IV, 4, 41.

<span id="fn_544"></span>[258:1](sbe3514.htm#fr_553.md) Pa*n*âmesi means,
in the technical legal phraseology of the Buddhist canon law, 'formally
dismissed, sent away, did not allow them any more to be his disciples,'
On this technical meaning of the term, compare Mahâvagga I, 2, 27, and
*K*ullavagga XII, 2, 3. (Childers does not give this use of the word.)
But it is difficult to imagine the circumstances under which the Buddha
could so have dismissed his two principal disciples. So I think we must
take the word in a less formal sense-such, for instance, as we find in
Thera Gâthâ 511, 557.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[258:2](sbe3514.htm#fr_554.md) Eta*m* tâva
*g*ânâhi ima*m* nâmâti. I follow Hîna*t*i-kumburê's rendering (p. 244)
of this difficult phrase, according to which there ought to be a full
stop in the text after pa*n*âmesi, and these words are supposed to be
addressed to Nâgasena by Milinda. But I am not at all satisfied that he
is right, and the text may be corrupt.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[259:1](sbe3514.htm#fr_555.md) This supposed fact
is already the ground of a comparison in the *K*ullavagga IX, 1, 3, 4
('Vinaya Texts,' III, 303)
