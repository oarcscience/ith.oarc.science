# BOOK IV.

## MENDAKA-PA*Ñ*HO.

### THE SOLVING OF DILEMMAS.

CHAPTER 1. \[**90**\]

1\. Master of words and sophistry, clever and wise  
Milinda tried to test great Nâgasena's skill.  
Leaving him not <span id="fr_321"></span>[1](#fn_313.md), again and yet
again,  
He questioned and cross-questioned him, until  
His own skill was proved foolishness.  
Then he became a student of the Holy Writ.  
All night, in secrecy, he pondered o'er  
The ninefold Scriptures, and therein he found  
Dilemmas hard to solve, and full of snares.  
And thus he thought: 'The conquering Buddha's words  
Are many-sided, some explanatory,  
Some spoken as occasion rose to speak,  
Some dealing fully with essential points.  
Through ignorance of what, each time, was meant  
There will be strife hereafter as to what  
The King of Righteousness has thus laid down  
In these diverse and subtle utterances.  
Let me now gain great Nâgasena's ear,  
And putting to him that which seems so strange  
And hard--yea contradictory--get him  
To solve it. So in future times, when men  
Begin to doubt, the light of his solutions  
Shall guide them, too, along the path of Truth.'

 

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

2\. Now Milinda the king, when the night was turning into day, and the
sun had risen, bathed, and with hands clasped and raised to his
forehead, called to mind the Buddhas of the past, the present, and the
future, and solemnly undertook the observance of the eightfold vow,
saying to himself: 'For seven days from now will I do penance by taking
upon myself the observance of the eight rules, and when my vow is
accomplished will I go to the teacher and put to him, as questions,
these dilemmas.' So Milinda, the king laid aside his usual dress, and
put off his ornaments; and clad in yellow robes, with only a recluse's
turban <span id="fr_322"></span>[1](#fn_314.md) on his head, in appearance
like a hermit, did he carry out the eightfold abstinence, keeping in
mind the vow--'For this seven days I am to decide no case at law. I am
to harbour no lustful thought, no thought of ill-will, no thought
tending to delusion. Towards all slaves, servants, and dependents I am
to show a meek and lowly disposition. \[**91**\] I am to watch carefully
over every bodily act, and over my six organs, of sense. And I am to
fill my heart with thoughts of love towards all beings.' Keeping this
eightfold vow, establishing his heart in this eightfold moral law, for
seven days he went not forth. But as the night was passing into day, at
sunrise of the eighth day, he took his breakfast early, and then with
downcast eyes and measured words, gentle in manner, collected in
thought, glad and pleased and rejoicing in heart, did he go to Nâgasena.
And bowing down at his feet, he stood respectfully on one side, and
said:

3\. 'There is a certain matter, venerable Nâgasena,

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

that I desire to talk over with you alone. I wish no third person to be
present. In some deserted spot, some secluded place in the forest, fit
in all the eight respects for a recluse, there should this point of mine
be put. And therein let there be nothing hid from me, nothing kept
secret. I am now in a fit state to hear secret things when we are deep
in consultation. And the meaning of what I say can be made clear by
illustration. As it is to the broad earth, O Nâgasena, that it is right
to entrust treasure when occasion arises for laying treasure by, so is
it to me that it is right to entrust secret things when we are deep in
consultation.'

4\. Then having gone with the master to a secluded spot he further said:
'There are eight kinds of places, Nâgasena, which ought to be altogether
avoided by a man who wants to consult. No wise man will talk a matter
over in such places, or the matter falls to the ground and is brought to
no conclusion. And what are the eight? Uneven ground, spots unsafe by
fear of men, windy places, hiding spots, sacred places, high roads,
light bambû bridges, and public bathing places.'

The Elder asked: 'What is the objection to each of these?'

The king replied: 'On uneven ground, Nâgasena, \[**92**\] the matter
discussed becomes jerky, verbose, and diffuse, and comes to nothing. In
unsafe places the mind is disturbed, and being disturbed does not follow
the point clearly. In windy spots the voice is indistinct. In hiding
places there are eavesdroppers. In sacred places the question discussed
is apt to be diverted to the serious surroundings. On a high road it is
apt to become frivolous, on a

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

bridge unsteady and wavering, at a public bathing place the discussion
would be matter of common talk. Therefore is it said <span
id="fr_323"></span>[1](#fn_315.md):

"Uneven ground, unsafe and windy spots,  
And hiding places, and god-haunted shrines,  
High roads, and bridges, and all bathing ghâts--  
These eight avoid when talking of high things."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

5\. 'There are eight kinds of people, Nâgasena, who when talking a
matter over, spoil the discussion. And who are the eight? He who walks
in lust, he who walks in ill-will, he who walks in delusion, he who
walks in pride, the greedy man, the sluggard, the man of one idea, and
the fool.'

'What is the objection to each of these?' asked the Elder.

'The first spoils the discussion by his lust, the next by his ill-will,
the third by his delusions, the fourth by his pride, the fifth by his
greed, the sixth by his sloth, the seventh by his narrowness, and the
last by his folly. Therefore is it said:

"The lustful, angry, or bewildered man,  
The proud, the greedy, or the slothful man,  
The man of one idea, and the poor fool--  
These eight are spoilers of high argument."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

6\. 'There are nine kinds of people, Nâgasena, who let out a secret that
has been talked over with them, and treasure it not up in their hearts.
And who are the nine? The lustful man reveals it in obedience to some
lust, the ill-tempered man in consequence

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

of some ill-will, the deluded man under some mistake. \[**93**\] The
timid man reveals it through fear, and the man greedy for gain to get
something out of it. A woman reveals it through infirmity, a drunkard in
his eagerness for drink, a eunuch because of his imperfection, and a
child through fickleness. Therefore is it said:

"The lustful, angry, or bewildered man,  
The timid man, and he who seeks for gain,  
A woman, drunkard, eunuch, or a child--  
These nine are fickle, wavering, and mean.  
When secret things are talked over to them  
They straightway become public property."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

7\. 'There are eight causes, Nâgasena, of the advance, the ripening of
insight. And what are the eight? The advance of years, the growth of
reputation, frequent questioning, association with teachers, one's own
reflection, converse with the wise, cultivation of the loveable, and
dwelling in a pleasant land. Therefore is it said:

"By growth in reputation, and in years,  
By questioning, and by the master's aid,  
By thoughtfulness, and converse with the wise,  
By intercourse with men worthy of love,  
By residence within a pleasant spot--  
By these nine is one's insight purified.  
They who have these, their wisdom grows <span
id="fr_324"></span>[1](#fn_316.md)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

8\. 'This spot, Nâgasena, is free from the objections to talking matters
over. And I am a model companion for any one desiring to do so. I can
keep a

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

secret, and will keep yours as long as I live. In all the eight ways
just described my insight has grown ripe. It would be hard to find such
a pupil as you may have in me.

\[**94**\] 'Now towards a pupil who conducts himself thus aright the
teacher ought to conduct himself in accordance with the twenty-five
virtues of a teacher. And what are the twenty-five? He must always and
without fail keep guard over his pupil. He must let him know what to
cultivate, and what to avoid; about what he should be earnest, and what
he may neglect. He must instruct him as to sleep, and as to keeping
himself in health, and as to what food he may take, and what reject. He
should teach him discrimination <span id="fr_325"></span>[1](#fn_317.md)
(in food), and share with him all that is put, as alms, into his own
bowl. He should encourage him, saying: "Be not afraid. You will gain
advantage (from what is here taught you)." He should advise him as to
the people whose company he should keep, and as to the villages and
Vihâras he should frequent. He should never indulge in (foolish)
talk <span id="fr_326"></span>[2](#fn_318.md) with him. When he sees any
defect in him he should easily pardon it. He should be zealous, he
should teach nothing partially, keep nothing secret, and hold nothing
back <span id="fr_327"></span>[3](#fn_319.md). He should look upon him in
his heart as a son, saying to himself: "I have begotten him in

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

learning <span id="fr_328"></span>[1](#fn_320.md)." He should strive to
bring him forward, saying to himself: "How can I keep him from going
back? "He should determine in himself to make him strong in knowledge,
saying to himself: "I will make him mighty." He should love him, never
desert him in necessity, never neglect him in anything he ought to do
for him, always befriend him--so far as he can rightly do so <span
id="fr_329"></span>[2](#fn_321.md)--when he does wrong. These, Sir, are the
twenty-five good qualities in a teacher. Treat me altogether in
accordance therewith. Doubt, Lord, has overcome me. There are apparent
contradictions in the word of the Conqueror. About them strife will
hereafter arise, and in future times it will be hard to find a teacher
with insight such as yours. Throw light for me on these dilemmas, to the
downfall of the adversaries.'

9\. Then the Elder agreed to what he had said, and in his turn set out
the ten good qualities which ought to be found in a lay disciple: 'These
ten, O king, are the virtues of a lay disciple. He suffers like pain and
feels like joy as the Order does. He takes the Doctrine (Dhamma) as his
master. He delights in giving so far as he is able to give. On seeing
the religion (Dhamma) of the Conqueror decay, he does his best to revive
it. He holds right views. Having no passion for excitement <span
id="fr_330"></span>[3](#fn_322.md), he runs

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

not after any other teacher his life long. He keeps guard over himself
in thought and deed. He delights in peace, is a lover of peace. He feels
no jealousy, \[**95**\] and walks not in religion in a quarrelsome
spirit. He takes his refuge in the Buddha, he takes his refuge in the
Doctrine, he takes his refuge in the Order. These, great king, are the
ten good qualities of a lay disciple. They exist all of them in you.
Hence is it fit, and right, and becoming in you that, seeing the decay
of the religion of the Conqueror, you desire its prosperity. I give you
leave. Ask of me whatever you will.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the introduction to the solving of dilemmas.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### THE DILEMMAS.

### \[ON HONOURS PAID TO THE BUDDHA.\]

10\. Then Milinda the king, having thus been granted leave, fell at the
feet of the teacher, and raising his clasped hands to his forehead,
said: 'Venerable Nâgasena, these leaders of other sects say thus: "If
the Buddha accepts gifts he cannot have passed entirely away. He must be
still in union with the world, having his being somewhere in it, in the
world, a shareholder in the things of the world; and therefore any
honour paid to him becomes empty and vain <span
id="fr_331"></span>[1](#fn_323.md). On the other hand if he

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

be entirely passed away (from life), unattached to the world, escaped
from all existence, then honours would not be offered to him. For he who
is entirely set free accepts no honour, and any act done to him who
accepts it not becomes empty and vain." This is a dilemma which has two
horns. It is not a matter within the scope of those who have no
mind <span id="fr_332"></span>[1](#fn_324.md), it is a question fit for the
great. Tear asunder this net of heresy, put it on one side. To you has
this puzzle been put. Give to the future sons of the Conqueror eyes
wherewith to see the riddle to the confusion of their adversaries.'

'The Blessed One, O king,' replied the Elder, 'is entirely set free. And
the Blessed One accepts no gift. Even at the foot of the Tree of Wisdom
he abandoned all accepting of gifts, how much more then now when he has
passed entirely away by that kind of passing away which leaves no root
over (for the formation of a new existence). For this, O king, has been
said by Sâriputta, the commander of the faith <span
id="fr_333"></span>[2](#fn_325.md):

"Though worshipped, these Unequalled Ones, alike  
By gods and men, unlike them all they heed  
Neither a gift nor worship. They accept  
It not, neither refuse it. Through the ages  
All Buddhas were so, so will ever be <span
id="fr_334"></span>[3](#fn_326.md)!"'

 

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

11\. The king said: 'Venerable Nâgasena, a father may speak in praise of
his son, or a son of his father. But that is no ground for putting the
adversaries to shame. It is only an expression of their own belief, Come
now! Explain this matter to me fully to the establishing of your own
doctrine, \[**96**\] and to the unravelling of the net of the heretics.'

The Elder replied: 'The Blessed One, O king, is entirely set free (from
life). And the Blessed One accepts no gift. If gods or men put up a
building to contain the jewel treasure of the relics of a Tathâgata who
does not accept their gift, still by that homage paid to the attainment
of the supreme good under the form of the jewel treasure of his wisdom
do they themselves attain to one or other of the three glorious
states <span id="fr_335"></span>[1](#fn_327.md). Suppose, O king, that
though a great and glorious fire had been kindled, it should die out,
would it then again accept any supply of dried grass or sticks?'

'Even as it burned, Sir, it could not be said to accept fuel, how much
less when it had died away, and ceased to burn, could it, an unconscious
thing, accept it?'

'And when that one mighty fire had ceased, and gone out, would the world
be bereft of fire?'

'Certainly not. Dry wood is the seat, the basis of fire, and any men who
want fire can, by the exertion of their own strength and power, such as
resides in individual men, once more, by twirling the firestick, produce
fire, and with that fire do any work for which fire is required.'

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

'Then that saying of the sectarians that "an act done to him who accepts
it not is empty and vain" turns out to be false. As that great and
glorious fire was set alight, even so, great king, was the Blessed One
set alight in the glory of his Buddhahood over the ten thousand world
systems. As it went out, so has he passed away into that kind of passing
away in which no root remains. As the fire, when gone out, accepted no
supply of fuel, just so, and for the good of the world, has his
accepting of gifts ceased and determined. As men, when the fire is out,
and has no further means of burning, then by their own strength and
effort, such as resides in individual men, twirl the fire-stick and
produce fire, and do any work for which fire is required--so do gods and
men, though a Tathâgata has passed away and no longer accepts their
gifts, yet put up a house for the jewel treasure of his relics, and
doing homage to the attainment of supreme good under the form of the
jewel treasure of his wisdom, they attain to one or other of the three
glorious states. \[**97**\] Therefore is it, great king, that acts done
to the Tathâgata, notwithstanding his having passed away and not
accepting them, are nevertheless of value and bear fruit.'

12\. 'Now hear, too, another reason for the same thing. Suppose, O king,
there were to arise a great and mighty wind, and that then it were to
die away. Would that wind acquiesce in being produced again?'

'A wind that has died away can have no thought or idea of being
reproduced. And why? Because the element wind is an unconscious thing.'

'Or even, O king, would the word "wind" be

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

still applicable to that wind, when it had so died away?'

'Certainly not, Sir. But fans and punkahs are means for the production
of wind. Any men who are oppressed by heat, or tormented by fever, can
by means of fans and punkahs, and by the exertion of their own strength
and power, such as resides in individual men, produce a breeze, and by
that wind allay their heat, or assuage their fever.'

'Then that saying of the sectarians that "an act done to him who accepts
it not is empty and vain" turns out to be false. As the great and mighty
wind which blew, even so, great king, has the Blessed One blown over the
ten thousand world systems with the wind of his love, so cool, so sweet,
so calm, so delicate. As it first blew, and then died away, so has the
Blessed One, who once blew with the wind so cool, so sweet, so calm, so
delicate, of his love, now passed away with that kind of passing away in
which no root remains. As those men were oppressed by heat and tormented
with fever, even so are gods and men tormented and oppressed with
threefold fire and heat <span id="fr_336"></span>[1](#fn_328.md). As fans
and punkahs are means of producing wind, so the relics and the jewel
treasure of the wisdom of a Tathâgata are means of producing the
threefold attainment. \[**98**\] And as men oppressed by heat and
tormented by fever can by fans and punkahs produce a breeze, and thus
allay the heat and assuage the fever, so can gods and men by offering
reverence to the relics, and the

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

jewel treasure of the wisdom of a Tathâgata, though he has died away and
accepts it not, cause goodness to arise within them, and by that
goodness can assuage and can allay the fever and the torment of the
threefold fire. Therefore is it, great king, that acts done to the
Tathâgata, notwithstanding his having passed away and not accepting
them, are nevertheless of value and bear fruit.'

13\. 'Now hear another reason. for the same thing. Suppose, O king, a
man were to make a drum sound, and then that sound were to die away.
Would that sound acquiesce in being produced again?'

'Certainly not, Sir. The sound has vanished. It can have no thought or
idea of being reproduced. The sound of a drum when it has once been
produced and died away, is altogether cut off. But, Sir, a drum is a
means of producing sound. And any man, as need arises, can by the effort
of power residing in himself, beat on that drum, and so produce a
sound.'

'Just so, great king, has the Blessed One--except the teacher and the
instruction he has left in his doctrine and discipline, and the jewel
treasure of his relics whose value is derived from his righteousness,
and contemplation, and wisdom, and emancipation, and insight given by
the knowledge of emancipation--just so has he passed away by that kind
of passing away in which no root remains. But the possibility of
receiving the three attainments is not cut off because the Blessed One
has passed away. Beings oppressed by the sorrow of becoming can, when
they desire the attainments, still receive them by means of the jewel
treasure of his relics and of his doctrine and discipline and teaching.
Therefore is it, great king, that

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

all acts done to the Tathâgata, notwithstanding his having passed away
and not accepting, are nevertheless of value and bear fruit. And this
future possibility, great king, has been foreseen by the Blessed One,
and spoken of, and declared, and made known, when he said: "It may be,
Ânanda, that in some of you the thought may arise: \[**99**\] 'The word
of the Master is ended. We have no Teacher more!' But it is not thus,
Ânanda, that you should regard it. The Truth which I have preached to
you, the Rules which I have laid down for the Order, let them, when I am
gone, be the Teacher to you <span id="fr_337"></span>[1](#fn_329.md)." So
that because the Tathâgata has passed away and consents not thereto,
that therefore any act done to him is empty and vain--this saying of the
enemy is proved false. It is untrue, unjust, not according to fact,
wrong, and perverse. It is the cause of sorrow, has sorrow as its fruit,
and leads down the road to perdition!'

14\. 'Now hear another reason for the same thing. Does the broad earth
acquiesce, O king, in all kinds of seeds being planted all over it?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'Then how is it those seeds, planted without the earth's consent, do yet
stand fast and firmly rooted, and expand into trees with great trunks
and sap and branches, and bearing fruits and flowers?'

'Though the earth, Sir, gives no consent, yet it acts as a site for
those seeds, as a means of their development. Planted on that site they
grow, by

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

its means, into such great trees with branches, flowers, and fruit.'

'Then, great king, the sectaries are destroyed, defeated, proved wrong
by their own words when they say that "an act done to him who accepts it
not is empty and vain." As the broad earth, O king, is the Tathâgata,
the Arahat, the Buddha supreme. Like it he accepts nothing. Like the
seeds which through it attain to such developments are the gods and men
who, through the jewel treasures of the relics and the wisdom of the
Tathâgata--though he have passed away and consent not to it--being
firmly rooted by the roots of merit, become like unto trees casting a
goodly shade by means of the trunk of contemplation, the sap of true
doctrine, and the branches of righteousness, and bearing the flowers of
emancipation, and the fruits of Sama*n*aship. \[**100**\] Therefore is
it, great king, that acts done to the Tathâgata, notwithstanding his
having passed away and not accepting them, are still of value and bear
fruit.'

15\. 'Now hear another and further reason for the same thing. Do camels,
buffaloes, asses, goats, oxen, or men acquiesce in the birth of worms
inside them?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'Then how is it then, that without their consent worms are so born, and
spread by rapid reproduction of sons and grandsons?'

'By the power of evil Karma, Sir.'

'Just so, great king, is it by the power of the relics and the wisdom of
the Tathâgata, who has passed away and acquiesces in nothing, that an
act done to him is of value and bears fruit.'

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

16\. 'Now hear another and further reason for the same thing. Do men
consent, O king, that the ninety-eight diseases should be produced in
their bodies?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'Then how is it the diseases come?'

'By evil deeds done in former births.'

'But, great king, if evil deeds done in a former birth have to be
suffered here and now, then both good and evil done here or done before
has weight and bears fruit. Therefore is it that acts done to the
Tathâgata, notwithstanding his having passed away and not consenting,
are nevertheless of value and bear fruit.'

17\. 'Now hear another and further reason for the same thing. Did you
ever hear, O king, of the ogre named Nandaka, who, having laid hands
upon the Elder Sâriputta, was swallowed up by the earth?'

'Yes, Sir, that is matter of common talk among men.'

'Well, did Sâriputta acquiesce in that?'

\[**101**\] 'Though the world of gods and men, Sir, were to be
destroyed, though the sun and moon were to fall upon the earth, though
Sineru the king of mountains were to be dissolved, yet would not
Sâriputta the Elder have consented to any pain being inflicted on a
fellow creature. And why not? Because every condition of heart which
could cause him to be angry or offended has been in him destroyed and
rooted out. And as all cause thereof had thus been removed, Sir,
therefore could not Sâriputta be angered even with those who sought to
deprive him of his life.'

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

'But if Sâriputta, O king, did not consent to it, how was it that
Nandaka was so swallowed up?'

'By the power of his evil deeds.'

'Then if so, great king, an act done to him who consents not is still of
power and bears fruit. And if this is so of an evil deed, how much more
of a good one? Therefore is it, O king, that acts done to the Tathâgata,
notwithstanding his having passed away and not accepting them, are
nevertheless of value and bear fruit.'

18\. 'Now how many, O king, are those men who, in this life, have been
swallowed up by the earth? Have you heard anything on that point?'

'Yes, Sir, I have heard how many there are.'

'Then tell me.'

'Ki*ñk*a the Brahmin woman, and Suppabuddha the Sâkyan, and Devadatta
the Elder, and Nandaka the ogre, and Nanda the Brahman--these are the
five people who were swallowed up by the earth.'

'And whom, O king, had they wronged?'

'The Blessed One and his disciples.'

'Then did the Blessed One or his disciples consent to their being so
swallowed up?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'Therefore is it, O king, that an act done to the Tathâgata,
notwithstanding his having passed away and not consenting thereto, is
nevertheless of value and bears fruit.'

'Well has this deep question been explained by you, venerable Nâgasena,
and made clear. You have made the secret thing \[**102**\] plain, you
have loosed the knot, you have made in the jungle an open space, the
adversaries are overthrown, the wrong opinion has been proved false, the
sectaries have been covered

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

with darkness when they met you, O best of all the leaders of schools!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the question as to not consenting to honours paid <span
id="fr_338"></span>[1](#fn_330.md).\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### \[THE OMNISCIENCE OF THE BUDDHA.\]

19\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, was the Buddha omniscient?'

'Yes, O king, he was. But the insight of knowledge was not always and
continually (consciously) present with him. The omniscience of the
Blessed One was dependent on reflection.' But if he did reflect he knew
whatever he wanted to know <span id="fr_339"></span>[2](#fn_331.md).

'Then, Sir, the Buddha cannot have been omniscient, if his all-embracing
knowledge was reached through investigation.'

'\[If so, great king, our Buddha's knowledge must have been less in
degree of fineness than that of the other Buddhas. And that is a
conclusion hard to draw. But let me explain a little further.\] Suppose,
O king, you had a hundred cart-loads of rice in the husk, and each
cart-load was of seven amma*n*as <span id="fr_340"></span>[3](#fn_332.md)
and a half. Would a man without consideration be able to tell you in a
moment how many laks of grains there were in the whole <span
id="fr_341"></span>[4](#fn_333.md)?'

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

20\. 'Now there are these, seven classes of minds. Those, great king,
who are full of lust, ill-will, delusion, or wrong doing, who are
untrained in the management of their body, or in conduct, or in thought,
or in wisdom,--their thinking powers are brought into play with
difficulty, and act slowly. And why is it so? Because of the untrained
condition of their minds. It is like the slow and heavy movements of a
giant bambû--when it is being dragged along with its wide-spreading,
extensive, overgrown, and interlaced vegetation, and with its branches
intricately entangled one with the other. So slow and heavy are the
movements of the minds of those men, O king. And why? Because of the
intricate entanglements of wrong dispositions. This is the first class
of minds.'

21\. 'From it the second class is to be distinguished. Those, O king,
who have been converted, for whom the gates of purgatory are closed, who
have attained to right views, who have grasped the doctrine of the
Master--their thinking powers, so far as the three lower stages <span
id="fr_342"></span>[1](#fn_334.md) are concerned, are brought quickly

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

into play, \[**103**\] and act with ease. But as regards the higher
regions they are brought into play with difficulty, and act slowly. And
why is this so? Because of their minds having been made clear as regards
those three stages, and because of the failings (to be vanquished in the
higher stages) still existing within them. It is like the movement of a
giant bambû which has a clean trunk as far as the third knot, but above
that has its branches intricately, entangled. So far as regards the
smooth trunk it would travel easily when dragged along, but it would
stick obstinately as regards its upper branches. This is the second
class of minds.'

22\. 'From these the third class is to be distinguished. Those, O king,
who are Sakad Âgâmins <span id="fr_343"></span>[1](#fn_335.md), in whom
lust, ill-will, and delusion are reduced to a minimum,--their thinking
powers, so far as the five lower stages are concerned, are brought
quickly into play, and act with ease. But as regards the higher regions
they are brought into play with difficulty, and act slowly. And why is
this so? Because of their minds having been made clear as regards those
five stages, and because of the failings (to be vanquished in the higher
stages) still existing within them. It is like the movement of a giant
bambû which has a clean trunk as far as the fifth knot, but above that
has its branches intricately entangled. So far as regards the smooth
trunk it would travel easily when dragged along, but it would be moved
with difficulty as far as its upper branches are concerned. This is the
third class of minds.'

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

23\. 'From these the fourth class is to be distinguished. Those, O king,
who are Anâgâmins <span id="fr_344"></span>[1](#fn_336.md), who have
completely got rid of the five lower fetters,--their thinking powers, so
far as the ten stages <span id="fr_345"></span>[2](#fn_337.md) are
concerned, are brought quickly into play, and act with ease. \[**104**\]
But as regards the higher regions they are brought into play with
difficulty, and act slowly. And why is this so? Because of their minds
having been made clear as regards those ten stages, and because of the
failings (to be vanquished in the higher stages) still existing within
them. It is like the movement of a giant bambû which has a smooth trunk
as far as the tenth knot, but above that has its branches intricately
entangled. This is the fourth class of minds.'

24\. 'From these the fifth class is to be distinguished. Those, O king,
who are Arahats, in whom the four Great Evils <span
id="fr_346"></span>[3](#fn_338.md) have ceased, whose stains have been
washed away, whose predispositions to evil <span
id="fr_347"></span>[4](#fn_339.md) have been put aside, who have lived the
life, and accomplished the task, and laid aside every burden, and
reached up to that which is good, for whom the Fetter of the craving
after any kind of future life has been broken to pieces <span
id="fr_348"></span>[5](#fn_340.md), who have reached the higher
insight <span id="fr_349"></span>[6](#fn_341.md), who are purified as
regards all those conditions of heart in which a

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

hearer can be pure,--their thinking powers, as regards all that a
disciple can be or do, are brought quickly into play, and act with ease.
But as to those things which are within the reach of the
Pa*kk*eka-Buddhas (of those who are Buddhas, but for themselves alone)
they are brought into play with difficulty, and act slowly. And why is
this so? Because of their having been made pure as regards all within
the province of a hearer, but not as regards that within the reach of
those who are Buddhas (though for themselves alone). It is like the
movement of a giant bambû which has been pruned of the branches arising
out of all its knots--and which, therefore, when dragged along moves
quickly and with ease, because of its smoothness all along, and because
of its being unencumbered with the jungly growth of vegetation. This is
the fifth class of minds.'

25\. \[**105**\] 'From these the sixth class is to be distinguished.
Those, O king, who are Pa*kk*eka-Buddhas, dependent on themselves alone,
wanting no teacher, dwellers alone like the solitary horn of the
rhinoceros, who so far as their own higher life is concerned, have pure
hearts free from stain,--their thinking powers, so far as their own
province is concerned, are brought quickly into play, and act with ease.
But as regards all that is specially within the province of a perfect
Buddha (one who is not only Buddha, that is enlightened, himself, but
can lead others to the light) they are brought with difficulty into
play, and move slowly. And why is this so? Because of their purity as
regards all within their own province, and because of the immensity of
the province of the omniscient Buddhas. It is like a man, O king, who
would fearlessly cross, and at will,

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

by day or night, a shallow brook on his own property. But when he comes
in sight of the mighty ocean, deep and wide and ever-moving, and sees no
further shore to it, then would he stand hesitating and afraid, and make
no effort even to get over it. And why? Because of his familiarity with
his own, and because of the immensity of the sea. This is the sixth
class of minds.'

26\. 'From these the seventh class is to be distinguished. Those, O
king, who are complete Buddhas <span id="fr_350"></span>[1](#fn_342.md),
having all knowledge, bearing about in themselves the tenfold power (of
the ten kinds of insight), confident in the four modes of just
self-confidence, endowed with the eighteen characteristics of a Buddha,
whose mastery knows no limit, from whose grasp nothing is hid,--their
thinking powers are on every point brought quickly into play, and act
with ease. Suppose, O king, a dart well burnished, free from rust,
perfectly smooth, with a fine edge, straight, without a crook or a flaw
in it, were to be set on a powerful crossbow. Would there be any
clumsiness in its action, any retarding in its movement, if it were
discharged by a powerful man against a piece of fine linen, or cotton
stuff, or delicate woolwork?'

'Certainly not, Sir. And why? Because the stuff is so fine, and the dart
so highly tempered, and the discharge so powerful.'

\[**106**\] 'And just in the same way, great king, are the thinking
powers of the Buddhas I have described brought quickly into play, and
act with ease.

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

\[paragraph continues\] And why? Because of their being purified in
every respect. This is the seventh class of minds.'

27\. 'Now of these, O king, the last--the thinking powers of the
omniscient Buddhas--altogether outclasses the other six, and is clear
and active in its high quality that is beyond our ken. It is because the
mind of the Blessed One is so clear and active that the Blessed One,
great king, displays the double miracle. From that we may get to know, O
king, how clear and active His mental powers are. And for those wonders
there is no further reason that can be alleged. (Yet) those wonders, O
king, \[caused by means of the mind (alone) of the omniscient
Buddhas <span id="fr_351"></span>[1](#fn_343.md)\] cannot be counted, or
calculated, or divided, or separated, (For) the knowledge of the Blessed
One, O king, is dependent upon reflection <span
id="fr_352"></span>[2](#fn_344.md), and it is on reflection that he knows
whatever he wishes to know. (But) it is as when a man passes something
he already has in one hand to the other, or utters a sound when his
mouth is open, or swallows some food that he has already in his mouth,
or opens his eyes when they are shut, or shuts them when open, or
stretches forth his arm when it is bent in, or bends it in when
stretched out--more rapid than that, great king, and more easy in its
action, is the all-embracing knowledge of the Blessed One, more rapid
than that his reflection. And although it is by reflection that they
know whatever they want to know, yet even when they

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

are not reflecting the Blessed Buddhas are not, even then, anything
other than omniscient.'

'But, venerable Nâgasena, reflection is carried on for the purpose of
seeking (that which is not clear when the reflection begins). Come now.
Convince me in this matter by some reason.'

'Suppose, O king, there were a rich man, great in wealth and
property--one who had stores of gold and silver and valuables, and
stores of all kinds of wheat, one who had rice, and paddy, and barley,
and dry grain, and oilseed, and beans, and peas, and every other edible
seed, who had ghee, and oil, and butter, and milk, and curds, and honey,
and sugar, and molasses, \[**107**\] all put away in store-rooms in
jars, and pots, and pans, and every sort of vessel. Now if a traveller
were to arrive, one worthy of hospitality, and expecting to be
entertained; and all the prepared food in the house had been finished,
and they were to get out of the jar some rice ready for cooking, and
prepare a meal for him. Would that wealthy man merely by reason of the
deficiency in eatable stuff at that unusual time be rightly called poor
or needy?'

'Certainly not, Sir. Even in the palace of a mighty king of kings there
might be no food ready out of time, how much less in the house of an
ordinary man.'

'Just so, great king, with the all-embracing knowledge of a Tathâgata
when reflection only is wanting; but which on reflection grasps whatever
he wants. Now suppose, O king, there were a tree in full fruit, with its
branches bending this way and that by the weight of the burden of the
bunches of its fruit, but no single fruit had fallen from it.

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Could that tree rightly, under the circumstances
of the case, be called barren, merely because of the want of a fallen
fruit?'

'No, Sir. For though the falling of the fruit is a condition precedent
to its enjoyment, yet when it has fallen one can take as much as one
likes.'

'Just so, great king, though reflection is a necessary condition of the
knowledge of the Tathâgata, yet on reflection it perceives whatever he
wants to know.'

'Does that happen always, Nâgasena, at the moment of reflection?'

'Yes, O king. just as when the mighty king of kings (the *K*akkavatti)
calling to mind his glorious wheel of victory wishes it to appear, and
no sooner is it thought of than it appears--so does the knowledge of the
Tathâgata follow continually on reflection.'

'Strong is the reason you give, Nâgasena, for the omniscience of the
Buddha. I am convinced that that is so.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the question as to the omniscience of the Buddha being
dependent on reflection <span id="fr_353"></span>[1](#fn_345.md).\]

### \[WHY DEVADATTA WAS ADMITTED TO THE ORDER.\]

28\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, who was it that admitted Devadatta <span
id="fr_354"></span>[2](#fn_346.md) to the Order?'

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

'Those six young nobles, O king, Bhaddiya and Anuruddha and Ânanda and
Bhagu and Kimbila and Devadatta, \[**108**\] together with Upâli the
barber as a seventh--they all, when the Master had attained to
Buddhahood, left the Sâkya home out of the delight they felt in him, and
following the Blessed One renounced the world <span
id="fr_355"></span>[1](#fn_347.md). So the Blessed One admitted them all to
the Order.'

'But was it not Devadatta who, after he had entered the Order, raised up
a schism within it?'

'Yes. No layman can create a schism, nor a sister of the Order, nor one
under preparatory instruction, nor a novice of either sex. It must be a
Bhikkhu, under no disability, who is in full communion, and a
co-resident <span id="fr_356"></span>[2](#fn_348.md).'

'And what Karma does a schismatical person gain?'

'A Karma that continues to act for a Kalpa (a very long period of
time).'

'What then, Nâgasena! Was the Buddha aware that Devadatta after being
admitted to the Order would raise up a schism, and having done so would
suffer torment in purgatory for a Kalpa?'

'Yes, the Tathâgata, knew that.'

'But, Nâgasena, if that be so, then the statement that the Buddha was
kind and pitiful, that he sought after the good of others, that he was
the remover of that which works harm, the provider of that which works
well to all beings--that statement must be wrong. If it be not so--if he
knew not that Devadatta

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

after he had been admitted to the Order would stir up a schism--then he
cannot have been omniscient. This other double-pointed dilemma is put to
you. Unravel this tough skein, break up the argument of the adversaries.
In future times it will be hard to find Bhikkhus like to you in wisdom.
Herein then show your skill!'

29\. 'The Blessed One, O king, was both full of mercy and had all
knowledge. It was when the Blessed One in his mercy and wisdom
considered the life history of Devadatta that he perceived how, having
heaped up Karma on Karma, he would pass for an endless series of Kalpas
from torment to torment, and from perdition to perdition. And the
Blessed One knew also that the infinite Karma of that man would, because
he had entered the Order, become finite, and the sorrow caused by the
previous Karma would also therefore become limited. \[**109**\] But that
if that foolish person were not to enter the Order then he would
continue to heap up Karma which would endure for a Kalpa. And it was
because he knew that that, in his mercy, he admitted him to the Order.'

'Then, Nâgasena, the Buddha first wounds a man and then pours oil on the
wound, first throws a man down a precipice and then reaches out to him
an assisting hand, first kills him and then seeks to give him life,
first gives pain and then adds a subsequent joy to the pain he gave.'

'The Tathâgata, O king, wounds people but to their good, he casts people
down but to their profit, he kills people but to their advantage. just
as mothers and fathers, O king, hurt their children and even knock them
down, thinking the while of their

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

good; so by whatsoever method an increase in the virtue of living things
can be brought about, by that method does he contribute to their good.
If Devadatta, O king, had not entered the Order, then as a layman he
would have laid up much Karma leading to states of woe, and so passing
for hundreds of thousands of Kalpas from torment to misery, and from one
state of perdition to another, he would have suffered constant pain. It
was knowing that, that in his mercy, the Blessed One admitted Devadatta
to the Order. It was at the thought that by renouncing the world
according to His doctrine Devadatta's sorrow would become finite that,
in his mercy, he adopted that means of making his heavy sorrow light.

30\. 'As a man of influence, O king, by the power of his wealth or
reputation or prosperity or birth, when a grievous penalty has been
imposed by, the king on some friend or relative of his, would get it
made light by the ability arising from the trust reposed in him;
\[**110**\] just so did the Blessed One, by admitting him to the Order,
and by the efficacy of the influence of righteousness and meditation and
wisdom and emancipation of heart, make light the heavy sorrow of
Devadatta, who would have had to suffer many hundreds of thousands of
Kalpas. As a clever physician and surgeon, O king, would make a grievous
sickness light by the aid of a powerful medicinal drug, just so did the
Blessed One, in his knowledge of the right means to an end, admit
Devadatta to the Order and thus make his grievous pain light by the aid
of the medicine of the Dhamma, strong by the power of mercy <span
id="fr_357"></span>[1](#fn_349.md). Was then, O king,

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

the Blessed One guilty of any wrong in that he turned Devadatta from
being a man of much sorrow into being a man of less sorrow?'

'No indeed, Sir. He committed no wrong, not even in the smallest
degree <span id="fr_358"></span>[1](#fn_350.md).'

'Then accept this, great king, to the full as the reason for which the
Blessed One admitted Devadatta to the Order.'

31\. 'Hear another and further reason, O king, for the Blessed One's
having admitted Devadatta. Suppose men were to seize and hurry before
the king some wicked robber, saying: "This is the wicked robber, your
Majesty. Inflict upon him such punishment as you think fit!" And
thereupon the king were to say to them: "Take this robber then, my men,
outside the town, and there on the place of execution cut off his head."
And they in obedience to his orders were to take that man accordingly
towards the place of execution. And some man who was high in office near
the king, and of great reputation and wealth and property, whose word
was held of weight <span id="fr_359"></span>[2](#fn_351.md), and whose
influence was great, should see him. And he were to have pity on him,
and were to say to those men: "Stay, good fellows. What good will
cutting off his head do to you? Save him alive, and cut off only a hand
or a foot. I will speak on his behalf to the king." And they at the word
of that influential person were to do so. Now would the officer who had
acted so towards him have been a benefactor to that robber?'

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

'He would have saved his life, Sir. And having done that, what would he
not have done?'

'But would he have done no wrong on account of the pain the man suffered
\[**111**\] when his hand or foot was cut off?'

'The pain the thief suffered, Sir, was his own fault. But the man who
saved his life did him no harm.'

'Just so, great king, was it in his mercy that the Blessed One admitted
Devadatta, with the knowledge that by that his sorrow would be
mitigated.'

32\. 'And Devadatta's sorrow, O king, was mitigated. For Devadatta at
the moment of his death took refuge in Him for the rest of his
existences when he said:

"In him, who of the best is far the best <span
id="fr_360"></span>[1](#fn_352.md),  
The god of gods, the guide of gods and men,  
Who see'th all, and bears the hundred marks  
Of goodness,--'tis in him I refuge take  
Through all the lives that I may have to live."

 <span id="fr_361"></span>[2](#fn_353.md)'If you divide this Kalpa, O king,
into six parts, it was at the end of the first part that Devadatta
created schism in the Order. After he has suffered the other five in
purgatory he will be released, and will become a Pa*kk*eka-Buddha <span
id="fr_362"></span>[3](#fn_354.md) under the name of A*tth*issara.'

'Great is the gift bestowed, Nâgasena, by the Blessed One on Devadatta.
In that the Tathâgata

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

has caused him to attain to the state of a Pa*kk*eka-Buddha, what has he
not done for him?'

'But inasmuch as Devadatta, O king, having made a schism in the Order,
suffers pain in purgatory, has not therefore the Blessed One done him
wrong?'

'No, Sir. That is Devadatta's own fault; and the Blessed One who
mitigated his suffering has done him no harm.'

'Then accept this, O king, to the full as the reason for the Blessed One
admitting Devadatta to the Order.

33\. 'Hear another and further reason, O king, for his having done so.
\[**112**\] Suppose in treating a wound full of matter and blood, in
whose grievous hollow the weapon which caused it remained, which stank
of putrid flesh, and was made worse by the pain that varied with
constantly changing symptoms, by variations in temperature, and by the
union of the three humours,--windy, bilious, and phlegmatic <span
id="fr_363"></span>[1](#fn_355.md),--an able physician and surgeon were to
anoint it with a rough, sharp, bitter, stinging ointment, to the end
that the inflammation should be allayed. And when the inflammation had
gone down, and the wound had become sweet, suppose he were then to cut
into it with a lancet, and burn it with caustic. And when he had
cauterised it, suppose he were to prescribe an alkaline wash, and anoint
it with some drug to the end that the wound might heal up, and the sick
man recover his health--now tell me, O king, would it be out of cruelty
that the surgeon thus smeared with ointment, and cut with the lancet,
and cauterised

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

with the stick of caustic, and administered a salty wash?'

'Certainly not, Sir; it would be with kindness in his heart, and intent
on the man's weal, that he would do all those things.'

'And the feelings of pain produced by his efforts to heal--would not the
surgeon be guilty of any wrong in respect of them?'

'How so? Acting with kind intent and for the man's weal, how could he
therein incur a wrong? It is of heavenly bliss rather that that kindly
surgeon would be worthy.'

'Just so, great king, was it in his mercy that the Blessed One admitted
Devadatta, to the end to release him from pain.'

34\. 'Hear another and further reason, O king, why the Blessed One did
so. Suppose a man had been pierced by a thorn. And another man with
kindly intent and for his good were to cut round the place with another
sharp thorn or with a lancet, and the blood flowing the while, were to
extract that thorn. Now would it be out of cruelty that he acted so?'

'Certainly not, Sir. For he acted with kindly intent, and for the man's
good. And if he had not done so the man might have died, or might have
suffered such pain that he would have been nigh to death.'

'Just even so, great king, was it of his mercy that the Tathâgata
admitted Devadatta, to the end to release him of his pain. If he had not
done so \[**113**\] Devadatta would have suffered torment in purgatory
through a succession of existences, through hundreds of thousands of
Kalpas.'

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

'Yes, Nâgasena, the Tathâgata turned Devadatta, who was being carried
down with the flood, with his head against the stream; he again pointed
out the road to Devadatta when he was lost in the jungle; he gave a firm
foothold to Devadatta when he was falling down the precipice: he
restored Devadatta to peace when he was swallowed up of desolation. But
the reason and the meaning of these things could no one have pointed
out, Nâgasena, unless he were wise as you!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma about Devadatta.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### \[VESSANTARA'S EARTHQUAKE.\]

35\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, the Blessed One said thus: "There are these
eight causes, O Bhikkhus, proximate or remote, for a mighty
earthquake <span id="fr_364"></span>[1](#fn_356.md)." This is an inclusive
statement, a statement which leaves no room for anything to be,
supplemented, a statement to which no gloss can be added. There can be
no ninth reason for an earthquake. If there were, the Blessed One would
have mentioned it. It, is because there is no other, that he left it
unnoticed. But we find another, and a ninth reason, when we are told
that on Vessantara's giving his mighty largesse the earth shook seven
times <span id="fr_365"></span>[2](#fn_357.md). If, Nâgasena, there are
eight causes for an earthquake, then what we hear of the earthquake at
Vessantara's largesse is false. And if that is true, then the statement
as to the eight

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

causes of earthquakes is false. This double-headed question, too, is
subtle, hard to unravel, dark, and profound. It is now put to you.
\[**114**\] No one of less knowledge can solve it, only one wise as
you.'

36\. 'The Blessed One made the statement you refer to, O king, and yet
the earth shook seven times at Vessantara's largesse. But that was out
of season, it was an isolated occurrence, it was not included in the
eight usual causes, and was not therefore reckoned as one of them. just,
O king, as there are three kinds of well-known rains reckoned in the
world-that of the rainy season, that of the winter months, and that of
the two months Âsâ*lh*a and Sâvana. If, besides these, any other rain
falls, that is not reckoned among the usual rains, but is called "a rain
out of season." And again, O king, just as there are five hundred rivers
which flow down from the Himâlayas, but of these ten only are reckoned
in enumerations of rivers--the Ganges, the Jumna, the A*k*iravatî, the
Sarabhû, the Mahî, the Indus, the Sarasvatî, the Vetravatî, the
Vîta*m*sâ, and the *K*andabhâgâ--the others not being included in the
catalogue because of their intermittent flow of water. And again, O
king, just as there are a hundred or two of officers under the king, but
only six of them are reckoned as officers of state--the
commander-in-chief, the prime minister, and the chief judge, and the
high treasurer, and the bearer of the sunshade of state, and the state
sword-bearer. And why? Because of their royal prerogatives. The rest are
not reckoned, they are all called simply officers. \[**115**\] Just as
in all these cases, great king, the seven times repeated earthquake at
the largesse of Vessantara was, as an isolated and extra

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

ordinary occurrence, and distinct from the eight usual ones, not
reckoned among those eight causes.'

37\. 'Now have you heard, O king, in the history of our faith of any act
of devotion being done so as to receive its recompense even in this
present life, the fame of which has reached up to the gods?'

'Yes, Lord, I have heard of such. There are seven cases of such
actions.'

'Who were the people who did those things?'

'Sumana the garland maker, and Eka-sâ*t*aka the brahman, and Pu*nn*a the
hired servant, and Mallikâ the queen, and the queen known as the mother
of Gopâla, and Suppiyâ the devoted woman, and Pu*nn*â the slave-girl. It
was these seven who did acts of devotion which bare fruit even in this
life, and the fame of which reached even to the gods.'

'And have you heard of others, O king, who, even in their human body,
mounted up to the blessed abode of the great Thirty-three?'

'Yes, I have heard, too, of them.'

'And who were they?'

'Guttila the musician, and Sâdhîna the king, and king Nimi, and king
Mandhâtâ--these four. Long ago was it done, this glorious deed and
difficult.'

'But have you ever heard, O king, of the earth shaking, either now or in
the past, and either once or twice or thrice, when a gift had been
given?'

'No, Sir, that I have not heard of.'

'And I too, O king--though I have received the traditions, and been
devoted to study, and to hearing the law, and to learning by heart, and
to the acquirements of discipleship, and though I have been ready to
learn, and to ask and to answer questions, and to sit at the feet of
teachers--I too have never heard

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

of such a thing, except only in the case of the splendid gift of
Vessantara the glorious king. And between the times of Kassapa the
Blessed One, and of the Blessed One the Sâkya sage, there have rolled by
hundreds of thousands of years, but in all that period I have heard of
no such case. \[**116**\] It is at no common effort, O king, at no
ordinary struggle, that the great earth is moved. It is when overborne
by the weight of righteousness, overpowered by the burden of the
goodness of acts which testify of absolute purity, that, unable to
support it, the broad earth quakes and trembles and is moved. Then it is
as when a wagon is overladen with a too heavy weight, and the nave and
the spokes are split, and the axletree is broken in twain. Then it is as
when the heavens, overspread with the waters of the tempest driven by
the wind, and overweighted with the burden of the heaped-up rain-clouds,
roar and creak and rage at the onset of the whirlwind. Thus was it,
great king, that the broad earth, unable to support the unwonted burden
of the heaped-up and wide-reaching force of king Vessantara's largesse,
quaked and trembled and was moved. For the heart of king Vessantara was
not turned in the way of lust, nor of ill-will, nor of dullness, nor of
pride, nor of delusion, nor of sin, nor of disputation, nor of
discontent, but it was turned mightily to generosity. And thinking: "Let
all those who want, and who have not yet come, now arrive! Let all who
come receive whate'er they want, and be filled with satisfaction!" it
was on giving, ever and without end, that his mind was set. And on these
ten conditions of heart, O king, was his mind too fixed--on
self-control, and on inward calm, and on

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

long-suffering, and on self-restraint, and on temperance, and on
voluntary subjugation to meritorious vows, and on freedom from all forms
of wrath and cruelty, and on truthfulness, and on purity of heart. He
had abandoned, O king, all seeking after the satisfaction of his animal
lusts, he had overcome all craving after a future life, his strenuous
effort was set only towards the higher life. He had given up, O king,
the caring for himself, and devoted himself thenceforth to caring for
others alone. His mind was fixed immovably on the thought: "How can I
make all beings to be at peace, healthy, and wealthy, and long lived?"
\[**117**\] And when, O king, he was giving things away, he gave not for
the sake of rebirth in any glorious state, he gave not for the sake of
wealth, nor of receiving gifts in return, nor of flattery, nor of long
life for himself, nor of high birth, nor of happiness, nor of power, nor
of fame, nor of offspring either of daughters or of sons--but it was for
the sake of supreme wisdom and of the treasure thereof that he gave
gifts so immense, so immeasurable, so unsurpassed. It was when he had
attained to that supreme wisdom that he uttered the verse:

"*G*âli, my son, and the Black Antelope,  
My daughter, and my queen, my wife, Maddî,  
I gave them all away without a thought--  
And 'twas for Buddhahood I did this thing <span
id="fr_366"></span>[1](#fn_358.md)."'

38\. 'The angry man, O king, did the great king Vessantara conquer by
mildness, and the wicked man by goodness, and the covetous by
generosity,

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

and the speaker of falsehood by truth, and all evil did he overcome by
righteousness <span id="fr_367"></span>[1](#fn_359.md). When he was thus
giving away--he who was seeking after righteousness, who had made
righteousness his aim--then were the great winds, on which the earth
rests below, agitated by the full force of the power of the influence
that resulted from his generosity, and little by little, one by one, the
great winds began to blow confusedly, and up and down and towards each
side the earth swayed, and the mighty trees rooted in the soil <span
id="fr_368"></span>[2](#fn_360.md) began to totter, and masses of cloud
were heaped together in the sky, and terrible winds arose laden with
dust, and the heavens rushed together, and hurricanes blew with violent
blasts, and a great and terrible mighty noise was given forth. And at
the raging of those winds, the waters little by little began to move,
and at the movement of the waters the great fish and the scaly creatures
were disturbed, and the waves began to roll in double breakers, and the
beings that dwell in the waters were seized with fear and as the
breakers rushed together in pairs the roar of the ocean grew loud, and
the spray was lashed into fury, and garlands of foam arose, and the
great ocean opened to its depths, and the waters rushed hither and
thither, the furious crests of their waves meeting this way and that;
and the Asuras, and Garu*l*as, and Yakkhas, and Nâgas <span
id="fr_369"></span>[3](#fn_361.md) shook with fear, and thought in their
alarm: "What now! How now! is the great ocean being turned upside down?
"

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

and sought, with terrified hearts, for a way of escape. And as the water
on which it rests <span id="fr_370"></span>[1](#fn_362.md) was troubled and
agitated, then the broad earth began to shake, and with it the mountain
ranges and the ocean depths, \[**118**\] and Sineru began to revolve,
and its rocky mountain crest became twisted. And at the trembling of the
earth, the serpents, and mungooses, and cats, and jackals, and boars,
and deer, and birds became greatly distressed, and the Yakkhas of
inferior power wept, while those of greater power were merry.

39\. 'Just, O king, as when a huge and mighty cauldron <span
id="fr_371"></span>[2](#fn_363.md) is placed in an oven full of water, and
crowded with grains of rice, then the fire burning beneath heats first
of all the cauldron, and when that has become hot the water begins to
boil, and as the water boils the grains of rice are heated and dive
hither and thither in the water, and a mass of bubbles arises, and a
garland of foam is formed--just so, O king, king Vessantara gave away
whatsoever is in the world considered most difficult to bestow, and by
reason of the nature of his generosity the great winds beneath were
unable to refrain from being agitated throughout, and on the great winds
being thrown into confusion the waters were shaken, and on the waters
being disturbed the broad earth trembled, and so then the winds and the
waters and the earth became all three, as it were, of one accord by the
immense and powerful influence that

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

resulted from that mighty giving. And there was never another giving, O
king, which had such power as that generosity of the great king
Vessantara.

40\. 'And just, O king, as there are many gems of value found in the
earth--the sapphire, and the great sapphire, and the wish-conferring
gem, and the cat's eye, and the flax gem <span
id="fr_372"></span>[1](#fn_364.md), and the Acacia gem <span
id="fr_373"></span>[2](#fn_365.md), and the entrancing gem, and the
favourite of the sun <span id="fr_374"></span>[3](#fn_366.md), and the
favourite of the moon <span id="fr_375"></span>[4](#fn_367.md), and the
crystal, and the ka*gg*opakkamaka <span id="fr_376"></span>[5](#fn_368.md),
and the topaz, and the ruby, and the Masâra stone <span
id="fr_377"></span>[6](#fn_369.md)--but the glorious gem of the king of
kings is acknowledged to be the chief of all these and surpassing all,
for the sheen of that jewel, O king, spreads round about for a league on
every side <span id="fr_378"></span>[7](#fn_370.md)--just so, O king, of
all the gifts that

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

have ever been given upon earth, even the greatest and the most
unsurpassed, that giving of the good king Vessantara is acknowledged to
surpass them all. And it was on the giving of that gift, O king, that
the broad earth shook seven times <span
id="fr_379"></span>[1](#fn_371.md).'

41\. 'A marvellous thing is it, Nâgasena, of the Buddhas, and a most
wonderful, that the Tathâgata even when a Bodisat (in the course of
becoming a Buddha) \[**119**\] was so unequalled in the world, so mild,
so kind, and held before him aims so high, and endeavours so grand. You
have made evident, Nâgasena, the might of the Bodisats, a most clear
light have you cast upon the perfection of the Conquerors, you have
shown how, in the whole world of gods and men, a Tathâgata, as he
continues the practice of his noble life, is the highest and the best.
Well spoken, venerable Nâgasena. The doctrine of the Conqueror has been
exalted, the perfection of the Conqueror has been glorified, the knot of
the arguments of the adversaries has been unravelled, the jar of the
theories of the opponents has been broken in pieces, the dilemma so
profound has been made clear, the jungle has been turned into open
country, the children of the Conqueror have received the desire of their
hearts <span id="fr_380"></span>[2](#fn_372.md). It is so, as you say, O
best of the leaders of schools, and I accept that which you have said!'

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

### \[KING SIVI <span id="fr_381"></span>[1](#fn_373.md).\]

42\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, your people say thus: "King Sivi gave his eyes
to the man who begged them of him, and when he had thus become blind,
new eyes were given to him from heaven <span
id="fr_382"></span>[2](#fn_374.md)." This statement is unpalatable <span
id="fr_383"></span>[3](#fn_375.md), it lays its speaker open to rebuke, it
is faulty. For it is said in the Sutta: "When the cause has been utterly
destroyed, when there is no longer any cause, any basis left, then the
divine eye cannot arise <span id="fr_384"></span>[4](#fn_376.md)." So if he
gave his eyes away, the statement that he received new (divine) ones
must be false: and if divine eyes arose to him; then the statement that
he gave his eyes away must be false. This dilemma too is a
double-pointed one, more knotty than a knot, more piercing than an
arrow, more confusing than a jungle. It is now put to you. Rouse up in
yourself the desire to, accomplish the task that is set to you, to the
refutation of the adversaries!'

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

'King Sivi gave his eyes away, O king. Harbour no doubt on that point.
And in stead thereof divine eyes were produced for him. Neither on that
point should you harbour doubt.'

'But then, Nâgasena, can the divine eye arise when the cause of it has
been utterly destroyed, when no cause for it, no basis, remains?'

'Certainly not, O king.'

'What then is the reason \[**120**\] by which in this case it arose,
notwithstanding that its cause had been utterly destroyed, and no cause
for it, no basis, remained. Come now. Convince me of the reason of this
thing.'

43\. 'What then, O king? Is there in the world such a thing as Truth, by
the asseveration of which true believers can perform the Act of
Truth <span id="fr_385"></span>[1](#fn_377.md)?'

'Yes, Lord, there is. And by it true believers make the rain to fall,
and fire to go out <span id="fr_386"></span>[2](#fn_378.md), and ward off
the effects of poison, and accomplish many other things they want to
do.'

'Then, great king, that fits the case, that meets it on all fours. It
was by the power of Truth that those divine eyes were produced for Sivi
the king. By the power of the Truth the divine eye arose when no other
cause was present, for the Truth itself was, in that case, the cause of
its production. Suppose,

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

\[paragraph continues\] O king, any Siddha (accomplished one <span
id="fr_387"></span>[1](#fn_379).md) on intoning a charm <span
id="fr_388"></span>[2](#fn_380.md), and saying: "Let a mighty rain now
fall!" were to bring about a heavy rainfall by the intoning of his
charm--would there in that case be any cause for rain accumulated in the
sky by which the rain could be brought about?'

'No, Sir. The charm itself would be the cause.'

'Just so, great king, in the case put. There would be no ordinary cause.
The Truth itself would be sufficient reason for the growth of the divine
eye!'

44\. 'Now suppose, O king, a Siddha were to intone a charm, and say:
"Now let the mighty blazing, raging mass of fire go back!" and the
moment the charm were repeated it were to retreat--would there be any
cause laid by which would work that result?'

'No, Sir. The charm itself would be the cause.'

'Just so, great king, would there in our case be no ordinary cause. The
power of the Truth would be sufficient cause in itself!'

45\. 'Now suppose, O king, one of those Siddhas were to intone a charm,
\[**121**\] and were then to say: "Let this malignant poison become as a
healing drug!" and the moment the charm were repeated that would be
so--would there be any cause in reserve for that effect to be produced?'

'Certainly not, Sir. The charm itself would cause the warding off of
that malignant poison.'

'Just so, great king, without any ordinary cause the Truth itself was,
in king Sivi's case, a sufficient reason for the reproduction of his
eyes.'

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

46\. 'Now there is no other cause, O king, for the attainment of the
four Noble Truths. It is only by means of an Act of Truth that they are
attained. In the land of China, O king, there is a king of China, who
when he wants to charm the great ocean, performs at intervals of four
months a solemn Act of Truth, and then on his royal chariot drawn by
lions, he enters a league's distance into the great ocean. Then in front
of the head of his chariot the mighty waves roll back, and when he
returns they flow once more over the spot. But could the ocean be so
drawn back by the ordinary bodily power of all gods and men combined?'

'Sir, even the water in a small tank could not be so made to retire, how
much less the waters of the great ocean!'

'By this know then the force of Truth. There is no place to which it
does not reach.'

47\. 'When Asoka the righteous ruler, O king, as he stood one day at the
city of Pâtaliputta in the midst of the townsfolk and the country
people, of his officers and his servants, and his ministers of state,
beheld the Ganges river as it rolled along filled up by freshets from
the hills, full to the brim and overflowing--that mighty stream five
hundred leagues in length, and a league in breadth--he said to his
officers: "Is there any one, my good friends, who is able to make this
great Ganges flow backwards and up stream?"

'"Nay, Sire, impossible," said they.

'Now a certain courtesan, Bindumatî by name, was in the crowd there at
the river side, \[**122**\] and she heard people repeat the question
that the king had asked. Then she said to herself: "Here am I, a

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

harlot, in this city of Pâ*t*aliputta, by the sale of my body do I gain
my livelihood, I follow the meanest of vocations. Let the king behold
the power of an Act of Truth performed even by such as I." And she
performed an Act of Truth <span id="fr_389"></span>[1](#fn_381.md). And
that moment the mighty Ganges, roaring and raging, rolled back, up
stream, in the sight of all the people!

'Then when the king heard the din and the noise of the movement of the
waves of the whirlpools of the mighty Ganges, amazed, and struck with
awe and wonder, he said to his officers: "How is this, that the great
Ganges is flowing backwards?"

'And they told him what had happened. Then filled with emotion the king
went himself in haste and asked the courtesan: "Is it true what they
say, that it is by your Act of Truth that this Ganges has been forced to
flow backwards?"

'"Yes, Sire," said she.

'And the king asked: "How have you such power in the matter? Or who is
it who takes your words to heart (and carries them out)? By what
authority is it that you, insignificant as you are <span
id="fr_390"></span>[2](#fn_382.md), have been able to make this mighty
river flow backwards?"

'And she replied: "It is by the power of Truth, great king."

'But the king said: "How can that power be in you--you, a woman of
wicked and loose life,

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

devoid of virtue, under no restraint <span
id="fr_391"></span>[1](#fn_383.md), sinful, who have overstepped all
limits, and are full of transgression, and live on the plunder of fools?
"

'"It is true, O king, what you say. That is just the kind of creature I
am. But even in such a one as I so great is the power of the Act of
Truth that I could turn the whole world of gods and men upside down by
it."

'Then the king said: "What is this Act of Truth? Come now, let me hear
about it."

'"Whosoever, O king, gives me gold--be he a noble or a brahman or a
tradesman or a servant--I regard them all alike. When I see he is a
noble I make no distinction in his favour. If I know him to be a slave I
despise him not. Free alike from fawning and from dislike do I do
service to him who has bought me. This, your Majesty, is the basis of
the Act of Truth by the force of which I turned the Ganges back."'

48\. 'Thus, O king, is it that there is nothing which those who are
stedfast to the truth may not enjoy. And so king Sivi gave his eyes away
to him who begged them of him, \[**123**\] and he received eyes from
heaven, and that happened by his Act of Truth. But what is said in the
Sutta that when the eye of flesh is destroyed, and the cause of it, the
basis of it, is removed, then can no divine eye arise, that is only said
of the eye, the insight, that arises out of contemplation. And thus, O
king, should you take it.'

'Well said, Nâgasena! You have admirably

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

solved the dilemma I put to you; you have rightly explained the point in
which I tried to prove you wrong; you have thoroughly overcome the
adversary. The thing is so, and I accept it thus <span
id="fr_392"></span>[1](#fn_384.md).'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma as to king Sivi's Act of Truth.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[THE DILEMMA AS TO CONCEPTION.

49\. This dilemma goes into details which can be best consulted in the
Pâli.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[THE DURATION OF THE FAITH.\]

55\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, it has been said by the Blessed One: "But now
the good law, Ânanda, will only stand fast for five hundred years <span
id="fr_393"></span>[2](#fn_385.md)." But on the other hand the Blessed One
declared, just before

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

his death, in response to the question put by Subhadda the recluse: "But
if in this system the brethren live the perfect life, then the world
would not be bereft of Arahats <span id="fr_394"></span>[1](#fn_386.md)."
This last phrase is absolute, inclusive; it cannot be explained away. If
the first of these statements be correct, the second is misleading, if
the second be right the first must be false. \[**131**\] This too is a
double-pointed question, more confused than the jungle, more powerful
than a strong man, more knotty than a knot. It is now put to you. Show
the extent of the power of your knowledge, like a leviathan in the midst
of the sea.'

56\. 'The Blessed One, O king, did make both those statements you have
quoted. But they are different one from the other both in the spirit and
in the letter. The one deals with the limit of the duration of the
doctrine <span id="fr_395"></span>[2](#fn_387.md), the other with the
practice of a religious life--two things widely distinct, as far removed
one from the other as the zenith is from the surface of the earth, as
heaven is from purgatory, as good is from evil, and as pleasure is from
pain. But though that be so, yet lest your enquiry should be vain, I
will expound the matter further in its essential connection.'

57\. 'When the Blessed One said that the good law <span
id="fr_396"></span>[3](#fn_388.md) would only endure for five hundred
years, he said so declaring the time of its destruction, limiting the
remainder of its existence. For he said: "The good law, Ânanda, would
endure for a thousand years if no women had been admitted to the

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Order. But now, Ânanda, it will only last five
hundred years." But in so saying, O king, did the Blessed One either
foretell the disappearance of the good law, or throw blame on the clear
understanding thereof?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'Just so. It was a declaration of injury done, an announcement of the
limit of what remained. As when a man whose income had been diminished
might announce publicly, making sure of what remained: "So much property
have I lost; so much is still left"--\[**132**\] so did the Blessed One
make known to gods and men what remained when he announced what had been
lost by saying: "The good law will now, Ânanda, endure for five hundred
years." In so saying he was fixing a limit to religion. But when in
speaking to Subhadda, and by way of proclaiming who were the true
Sama*n*as, he said: "But if, in this system, the brethren live the
perfect life, then the world would not be bereft of Arahats"--in so
saying he was declaring in what religion consisted. You have confounded
the limitation of a thing with the statement of what it is. But if you
like I will tell you what the real connection between the two is. Listen
carefully, and attend trustfully to what I say.'

58\. 'Suppose, O king, there were a reservoir quite full of fresh cool
water, overflowing at the brim, but limited in size and with an
embankment running all round it. Now if, when the water had not abated
in that tank, a mighty cloud were to rain down rain continually, and in
addition, on to the water already in it, would the amount of water in
the tank decrease or come to an end?'

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'But why not, O king?'

'Because of the Continual downpour of the rain.'

'Just so, O king, is the glorious reservoir of the good law of the
teaching of the Conqueror ever full of the clear fresh cool water of the
practice of duty and virtue and morality and purity of life, and
continues overflowing all limits even to the very highest heaven of
heavens. And if the children of the Buddha rain down into it
continuously, and in addition, the rainfall of still further practice of
duty and virtue and morality and purity of life, then will it endure for
long, and the world will not be bereft of Arahats. This was the meaning
of the Master's words when he said: "But if, Subhadda, in this system
the brethren continue in perfectness of life, then will the world not be
bereft of Arahats."'

59\. 'Now suppose again, O king, that people were to continually supply
a mighty fiery furnace with dried cow-dung, and dry sticks, and dry
leaves--would that fire go out?'

\[**133**\] 'No indeed, Sir. Rather would it blaze more fiercely, and
burn more brightly.'

'Just so, O king, does the glorious teaching of the Conqueror blaze and
shine over the ten thousand world systems by the practice of duty and
virtue and morality and purity of life. And if, O king, in addition to
that, the children of the Buddha, devoting themselves to the five <span
id="fr_397"></span>[1](#fn_389.md) kinds of spiritual exertion, continue
zealous in effort--if cultivating a longing for the threefold
discipline, they train themselves therein--

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

if without ceasing they carry out to the full the conduct that is right,
and absolutely avoid all that is wrong, and practise righteousness of
life--then will this glorious doctrine of the Conqueror stand more and
more stedfast as the years roll on, and the world will not be bereft of
Arahats. It was in reference to this, O king, that the Master spake when
he said: "But if, Subhadda, in this system the brethren continue in
perfectness of life, then will the world not be bereft of Arahats."'

60\. 'Again, O king, suppose people were to continually polish with fine
soft red powder a stainless mirror that was already bright and shining,
well polished, smooth, and glossy, would dirt and dust and mud arise on
its surface?'

'No indeed,--Sir. Rather would it become to a certainty even more
stainless than before.'

'Just so, O king, is the glorious doctrine of the Conqueror stainless by
nature, and altogether free from the dust and dirt of evil. And if the
children of the Buddha cleanse it by the virtue arising from the shaking
off, the eradication of evil, from the practice of duty and virtue and
morality and purity of life, then will this glorious doctrine endure for
long, and the world will not be bereft of Arahats. It was in reference
to this that the Blessed One spake when he said: "But if, Subhadda, in
this system the brethren continue in righteousness of life, then will
not the world be bereft of Arahats." For the teaching of the Master, O
king, has its root in conduct, has conduct as its essence, and stands
fast so long as conduct does not decline <span
id="fr_398"></span>[1](#fn_390.md).'

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

61\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, when you speak of the disappearance of the
good law, what do you mean by its disappearance?'

'There are three modes of the disappearance, O king, of a system of
doctrine. And what are the three? The decline of attainment to an
intellectual grasp of it, the decline of conduct in accordance with it,
and the decline of its outward form <span
id="fr_399"></span>[1](#fn_391.md). \[**134**\] When the attainment of it
ceases, then even the man who conducts himself aright in it has no clear
understanding of it. By the decline of conduct the promulgation of the
rules of discipline ceases, only the outward form of the religion
remains. When the outward form has ceased, the succession of the
tradition is cut off. These are the three forms of the disappearance of
a system of doctrine.'

'You have well explained, venerable Nâgasena, this dilemma so profound,
and have made it plain. You have loosed the knot; you have destroyed the
arguments of the adversary, broken them in pieces, proved them
wrong--you, O best of the leaders of schools!'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma as to the duration of the faith.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### \[THE BUDDHA'S SINLESSNESS.\]

62\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, had the Blessed One, when he became a Buddha,
burnt out all evil in himself, or was there still some evil remaining in
him?'

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

'He had burnt out all evil. There was none left.'

'But how, Sir? Did not the Tathâgata get hurt in his body?'

'Yes, O king. At Râ*g*agaha a splinter of rock pierced his foot <span
id="fr_400"></span>[1](#fn_392.md), and once he suffered from
dysentery <span id="fr_401"></span>[2](#fn_393.md), and once when the
humours of his body were disturbed a purge was administered to him <span
id="fr_402"></span>[3](#fn_394.md), and once when he was troubled with wind
the Elder who waited on him (that is Ânanda) gave him hot water <span
id="fr_403"></span>[4](#fn_395.md).'

'Then, Sir, if the Tathâgata, on his becoming a Buddha, has destroyed
all evil in himself--this other statement that his foot was pierced by a
splinter, that he had dysentery, and so on, must be false. But if they
are true, then he cannot have been free from evil, for there is no pain
without Karma. All pain has its root in Karma, it is on account of Karma
that suffering arises <span id="fr_404"></span>[5](#fn_396.md). This
double-headed dilemma is put to you, and you have to solve it.'

63\. 'No, O king. It is not all suffering that has its root in Karma.
There are eight causes by which sufferings arise, by which many beings
suffer pain. And what are the eight? Superabundance of wind, \[**135**\]
and of bile, and of phlegm, the union of these humours, variations in
temperature, the avoiding of

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

dissimilarities, external agency, and Karma. From each of these there
are some sufferings that arise, and these are the eight causes by which
many beings suffer pain. And therein whosoever maintains that it is
Karma that injures beings, and besides it there is no other reason for
pain, his proposition is false.'

'But, Sir, all the other seven kinds of pain have each of them also
Karma as its origin, for they are all produced by Karma.'

'If, O king, all diseases were really derived from Karma then there
would be no characteristic marks by which they could be distinguished
one from the other. When the wind is disturbed, it is so in one or other
of ten ways--by cold, or by heat, or by hunger, or by thirst, or by over
eating, or by standing too long, or by over exertion, or by walking too
fast, or by medical treatment, or as the result of Karma. Of these ten,
nine do not act in a past life or in a future life, but in one's present
existence. Therefore it is not right to say that all pain is due to
Karma. When the bile, O king, is deranged it is so in one or other of
three ways--by cold, or by heat, or by improper food. When the phlegm is
disturbed it is so by cold, or by heat, or by food and drink. When
either of these three humours are disturbed or mixed, it brings about
its own special, distinctive pain. Then there are the special pains
arising from variations in temperature, avoidance of dissimilarities,
and external agency <span id="fr_405"></span>[1](#fn_397.md). And there is
the act that has Karma as its fruit, and the pain so brought about
arising from the act done. So what

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

arises as the fruit of Karma is much less than that which arises from
other causes. And the ignorant go too far \[**136**\] when they say that
every pain is produced as the fruit of Karma. No one without a Buddha's
insight can fix the extent of the action of Karma.'

64\. 'Now when the Blessed One's foot was torn by a splinter of rock,
the pain that followed was not produced by any other of the eight causes
I have mentioned, but only by external agency. For Devadatta, O king,
had harboured hatred against the Tathâgata during a succession of
hundreds of thousands of births <span id="fr_406"></span>[1](#fn_398.md).
It was in his hatred that he seized hold of a mighty mass of rock, and
pushed it over with the hope that it would fall upon his head. But two
other rocks came together, and intercepted it before it had reached the
Tathâgata; and by the force of their impact a splinter was torn off, and
fell upon the Blessed One's foot, and made it bleed. Now this pain must
have been produced in the Blessed One either as the result of his own
Karma, or of some one else's act. For beyond these two there can be no
other kind of pain. It is as when a seed does not germinate--that must
be due either to the badness of the soil, or to a defect in the seed. Or
it is as when food is not digested--that must be due either to a defect
in the stomach, or to the badness of the food.'

65\. 'But although the Blessed One never suffered pain which was the
result of his own Karma, or brought about the avoidance of
dissimilarity <span id="fr_407"></span>[2](#fn_399.md), yet

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

he suffered pain from each of the other six causes. And by the pain he
could suffer it was not possible to deprive him of life. There come to
this body of ours, O king, compounded of the four elements <span
id="fr_408"></span>[1](#fn_400.md), sensations desirable and the reverse,
pleasant and unpleasant. Suppose, O king, a clod of earth were to be
thrown into the air, and to fall again on to the ground. Would it be in
consequence of any act it had previously done that it would so fall?'

'No, Sir. There is no reason in the broad earth by which it could
experience the result of an act either good or evil. It would be by
reason of a present cause \[**137**\] independent of Karma that the clod
would fall to earth again.'

'Well, O king, the Tathâgata should be regarded as the broad earth. And
as the clod would fall on it irrespective of any act done by it, so also
was it irrespective of any act done by him that that splinter of rock
fell upon his foot.'

66\. 'Again, O king, men tear up and plough the earth. But is that a
result of any act previously done?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'Just so with the falling of that splinter. And the dysentery which
attacked him was in the same way the result of no previous act, it arose
from the union of the three humours. And whatsoever bodily disease fell
upon him, that had its origin, not in Karma, but in one or other of the
six causes referred to. For it has been said, O king, by the Blessed
One, by him who is above all gods, in the glorious collection called the
Samyutta Nikâya in

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

the prose Sutta, called after Moliya Sîvaka: "There are certain pains
which arise in the world, Sîvaka, from bilious humour. And you ought to
know for a certainty which those are, for it is a matter of common
knowledge in the world which they are. But those Samanas and Brahmans,
Sîvaka, who are of the opinion and proclaim the view that whatsoever
pleasure, or pain, or indifferent sensation, any man experiences, is
always due to a previous act--they go beyond certainty, they go beyond
knowledge, and therein do I say they are wrong. And so also of those
pains which arise from the phlegmatic humour, or from the windy humour,
or from the union of the three, or from variation in temperature, or
from avoidance of dissimilarity, \[**138**\] or from external action, or
as the result of Karma. In each case you should know for a certainty
which those are, for it is a matter of common knowledge which they are.
But those Samanas or Brahmans who are of the opinion or the view that
whatsoever pleasure, or pain, or indifferent sensation, any man may
experience, that is always due to a previous act--they go beyond
certainty, they go beyond common knowledge. And therein do I say they
are wrong." So, O king, it is not all pain that is the result of Karma.
And you should accept as a fact that when the Blessed One became a
Buddha he had burnt out all evil from within him.'

'Very good, Nâgasena! It is so; and I accept it as you say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma as to the Buddha's sinlessness.\]

 

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

### \[ON THE ADVANTAGES OF MEDITATION <span id="fr_409"></span>[1](#fn_401.md).\]

67\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, your people say that everything which a
Tathâgata has to accomplish that had the Blessed One already carried out
when he sat at the foot of the Tree of Wisdom <span
id="fr_410"></span>[2](#fn_402.md). There was then nothing that he had yet
to do, nothing that he had to add to what he had already done. But then
there is also talk of his having immediately afterwards remained plunged
for three months in ecstatic contemplation <span
id="fr_411"></span>[3](#fn_403.md). If the first statement be correct, then
the second must be false. And if the second be right, then the first
must be wrong. There is no need of any contemplation to him who has
already accomplished his task. It is the man who still has something
left to do, who has to think about it. \[**139**\] It is the sick man
who has need of medicine, not the healthy; the hungry man who has need
of food, not the man whose hunger is quenched. This too is a
double-headed dilemma, and you have to solve it!'

68\. 'Both statements, O king, are true. Contemplation

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

has many virtues. All the Tathâgatas attained, in contemplation, to
Buddhahood, and practised it in the recollection of its good qualities.
And they did so in the same way as a man who had received high office
from a king would, in the recollection of its advantages, of the
prosperity he enjoyed by means of it, remain constantly in attendance on
that king--in the same way as a man who, having been afflicted and
pained with a dire disease, and having recovered his health by the use
of medicine, would use the same medicine again and again, calling to
mind its virtue.'

69\. 'And there are, O king, these twenty and eight good qualities of
meditation in the perception of which the Tathâgatas devoted themselves
to it. And which are they? Meditation preserves him who meditates, it
gives him long life, and endows him with power, it cleanses him from
faults, it removes from him any bad reputation giving him a good name,
it destroys discontent in him filling him with content, it releases him
from all fear endowing him with confidence, it removes sloth far from
him filling him with zeal, it takes away lust and ill-will and dullness,
it puts an end to pride, it breaks down all doubt, it makes his heart to
be at peace, it softens his mind, \[**140**\] it makes him glad, it
makes him grave, it gains him much advantage, it makes him worthy of
reverence, it fills him with joy, it fills him with delight, it shows
him the transitory nature of all compounded things, it puts an end to
rebirth, it obtains for him all the benefits of renunciation. These, O
king, are the twenty and eight virtues of meditation on the perception
of which the Tathâgatas devote themselves to it. But it is because

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

the Tathâgatas, O king, long for the enjoyment of the bliss of
attainment, of the joy of the tranquil state of Nirvâna, that they
devote themselves to meditation, with their minds fixed on the end they
aim at.

70\. 'And there are four, reasons for which the Tathâgatas, O king,
devote themselves to meditation. And what are the four? That they may
dwell at ease, O king--and on account of the abundance of the advantages
of meditation, advantages without drawback--and on account of its being
the road to all noble things without exception-and because it has been
praised and lauded and exalted and magnified by all the Buddhas. These
are the reasons for which the Tathâgatas devote themselves to it. So it
is not, great king, because they have anything left to do, or anything
to add to what they have already accomplished, but because they have
perceived how diversified are the advantages it possesses, that they
devote themselves to meditation.'

'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Here ends the dilemma as to meditation.\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### \[THE LIMIT OF THREE MONTHS.\]

71\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, it has been said by the Blessed One: "The
Tathâgata, Ânanda, has thought out and thoroughly practised, developed,
accumulated, and ascended to the very height of the four paths to
saintship <span id="fr_412"></span>[1](#fn_404.md), and so mastered them as
to be able to use them as a means of mental advancement, and as a basis
for edification--and he therefore, Ânanda,

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

should he desire it, might remain alive for a Kalpa, or for that portion
of a Kalpa which has yet to run <span id="fr_413"></span>[1](#fn_405.md)."
And again he said: "At the end of three months from this time the
Tathâgata will die <span id="fr_414"></span>[2](#fn_406.md)." If the first
of these statements were true, then the limit of three months must have
been false. If the second were true, \[**141**\] then the first must
have been false. For the Tathâgatas boast not without an occasion, the
Blessed Buddhas speak no misleading words, but they utter truth, and
speak sincerely. This too is a double-headed dilemma, profound, subtle,
hard to expound. It is now put to you. Tear in sunder this net of
heresy, put it on one side, break in pieces the arguments of the
adversary!'

72\. 'Both these statements, O king, were made by the Blessed One. But
Kalpa in that connection means the duration of a man's life. And the
Blessed One, O king, was not exalting his own power when he said so, but
he was exalting the power of Saintship. It was as if a king were
possessed of a horse most swift of foot, who could run like the wind.
And in order to exalt the power of his speed the king were to say in the
presence of all his court-townsfolk and country folk, hired servants and
men of war, brahmins, nobles, and officers: "If he wished it this noble
steed of mine could cross the earth to its ocean boundary, and be back
here again, in a moment <span id="fr_415"></span>[3](#fn_407.md)!"

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Now though he did not try to test the horse's
speed in the presence of the court, yet it had that speed, and was,
really able to go along over the earth to its ocean boundary in a
moment. Just so, O king, the Blessed One spake as he did in praise of
the power of saintship, and so spake seated in the midst of gods and
men, and of the men of the threefold wisdom and the sixfold insight--the
Arahats pure and free from stain--when he said: "The Tathâgata, Ânanda,
has thought out and practised, developed, accumulated, and ascended to
the very height of the four powers of saintship, and so mastered them as
to be able to use them as a means of mental advancement, as a basis for
edification. And he therefore, Ânanda, should he desire it, might remain
alive for a Kalpa, or the part of a Kalpa that has yet to run." And
there was that power, O king, in the Tathâgata, he could have remained
alive for that time: and yet he did not show that power in the midst
\[**142**\] of that assembly. The Blessed One, O king, is free from
desire as respects all conditions of future life, and has condemned them
all. For it has been said, O king, by the Blessed One: "Just, O
Bhikkhus, as a very small quantity of excrement is of evil smell, so do
I find no beauty in the very smallest degree of future life, not even in
such for the time of the snapping of the fingers <span
id="fr_416"></span>[1](#fn_408.md)." Now would the Blessed One, O king, who
thus looked upon all sorts and conditions of future life

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

as dung have nevertheless, simply because of his power of Iddhi,
harboured a craving desire for future life?'

'Certainly not, Sir.'

'Then it must have been to exalt the power of Iddhi that he gave
utterance to such a boast.'

'Very good, Nâgasena! It is so, and I accept it as you say.

where the verses here (or the others quoted in these two pages) are
taken from.

<span id="fn_316"></span>[141:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_324.md) Pabhi*gg*ati in the
text appears not to be an old error. The Si*m*halese repeats it, but
leaves it untranslated.

<span id="fn_317"></span>[142:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_325.md) Viseso. It does not
say in what, and the Si*m*halese simply repeats the word.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[142:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_326.md) Sallâpo na kâtabbo.
The Si*m*halese merely repeats the word, which is often used without any
bad connotation. See, for instance, *G*âtaka I, 112.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[142:3](sbe3512.htm#fr_327.md) So that, in the
author's opinion, there is no 'Esoteric Doctrine' in true Buddhism. See
the note, below, on 1V, 4, 8.

<span id="fn_320"></span>[143:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_328.md) So also in the
Vinaya (Mahâvagga I, 2 5, 6).

<span id="fn_321"></span>[143:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_329.md) In the well-known
passage in the Vinaya in which the mutual duties of pupils and teachers
are set out in full (Mahâvagga I, 25, 26, translated in the 'Vinaya
Texts,' vol. i, pp. 154 and foll.) there is a similar injunction (25, 22
= 26, 10) which throws light on the meaning of dhammena here.

<span id="fn_322"></span>[143:3](sbe3512.htm#fr_330.md)
Apagata-ko*t*ûhala-ma<u>n</u>galiko. 'Laying aside the erroneous views
and discipline called ko*t*ûhala and ma<u>n</u>galiko,' says the
Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_323"></span>[144:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_331.md) 'Because honours
should be paid, in the way of worship, to those who have so passed away,
and to them only,' is the implied suggestion, as if it were common
ground to the Buddhists and their opponents. But there is no such
doctrine in the Pâli Pi*t*akas, and could not be. The whole discussion
breathes the spirit of a later time.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[145:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_332.md) Apatta-mânâsana*m*.
'Of those who have not attained to the insight of the Arahats,' says the
Si*m*halese by way of gloss.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[145:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_333.md) This verse is not
found in our printed texts. The Thera Gâthâ (981-1017) has preserved
thirty-seven of the verses attributed to Sâriputta, but this is not one
of them.

<span id="fn_326"></span>[145:3](sbe3512.htm#fr_334.md) Hîna*t*i-kumburê,
who quotes the Pâli verses, reads pû*g*ayantâ, and sâdîyanti.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[146:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_335.md) Tisso sampattiyo.
That is, to another life as a man, or as a god, or to Arahatship here,
on earth, in this birth.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[148:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_336.md) That is, the three
fires of lust, ill-will, and delusion, the going out of which is the
state called, par excellence, 'the going out' (Nirvâ*n*a).

<span id="fn_329"></span>[150:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_337.md) Book of the Great
Decease, VI, 1, translated in 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 112.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[154:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_338.md) This title and the
subsequent ones to the various questions are added from the Si*m*halese.
They are probably the same titles as those referred to by Mr. Trenckner
in his preface as being in his Burmese MS.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[154:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_339.md) So again below, §
27.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[154:3](sbe3512.htm#fr_340.md) An amma*n*a is
about four bushels.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[154:4](sbe3512.htm#fr_341.md) Mr. Trenckner has
marked this passage as corrupt, and I do not pretend to understand it
either. The Si*m*halese is also very <span id="page_155">p. 155</span>
involved and confused. I have added the words in brackets from the
Si*m*halese, and translated the rest according to the general sense of
the Si*m*halese and the figures of the Pâli. Hardy gives his 'version'
at p. 386 of the 'Manual of Buddhism.' It says, 'In one load of rice
there are 63,660,000 grains. Each of these grains can be separately
considered by Buddha in a moment of time. In that moment the seven-times
gifted mind exercises this power.' The last sentence is a
misunderstanding of the opening words of our next section (IV, i, 20).

<span id="fn_334"></span>[155:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_342.md) That is, of the
Excellent Way. They are the three Fetters--Delusion of self, Doubt, and
Dependence on rites and ceremonies and outward morality--which the
Sotâpanno has conquered, broken.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[156:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_343.md) Disciples who will
return only once to this world, there attain Arahatship, and therefore
pass away.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[157:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_344.md) Who will not return
even once to this world, but attain Arahatship in heaven.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[157:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_345.md) This is noteworthy,
for their mind is not yet quite clear as regards the higher five stages.
But it is on all fours with the last section.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[157:3](sbe3512.htm#fr_346.md) Lust, becoming,
delusion, and ignorance.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[157:4](sbe3512.htm#fr_347.md) Kilesâ.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[157:5](sbe3512.htm#fr_348.md)
Parikkî*n*a-bhava-sa*m*yo*g*anâ.

<span id="fn_341"></span>[157:6](sbe3512.htm#fr_349.md)
Patta-pa*t*isambhidâ.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[159:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_350.md) That is as
distinguished from the last--not only themselves enlightened, but able
to teach, leaders of men.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[160:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_351.md) There is surely
something wrong here; either in the Pâli, or in my interpretation of it,
which follows the Si*m*halese (p. 130).

<span id="fn_344"></span>[160:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_352.md) Here the opening
argument of § 17 is again taken up.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[162:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_353.md) At III, 6, 2 there
is another problem raised as to the omniscience of the Buddha.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[162:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_354.md) He is the Judas of
the Buddhist story, who tried to have the Buddha killed, and to seduce
his disciples from him.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[163:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_355.md) Hîna*t*i-kumburê
takes kulâ as an ablative.

<span id="fn_348"></span>[163:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_356.md) These are all
termini technici in Buddhist canon law. The meaning is that other
divisions in the Order do not amount technically to schism. See the
*K*ullavagga VII, 1, 27, &c.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[165:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_357.md)

See my note, *K*ullavagga VI, 4, 8, and also Puggala Pa*ññ*atti III, 12,

<span id="fn_352"></span>[167:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_360.md) Literally, 'is the
best of these eight'--the eight being those walking in the Excellent
Way, the four magga-sama<u>n</u>gino and the four
phala-sama<u>n</u>gino. See Puggala Pa*ññ*atti VIII, 1.

<span id="fn_353"></span>[167:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_361.md) The Si*m*halese
inserts a paragraph here not found in Mr. Trenckner's text.

<span id="fn_354"></span>[167:3](sbe3512.htm#fr_362.md) See above, [p.
158](#page_158.md).

<span id="fn_355"></span>[168:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_363.md) The interpretation
of some of the medical terms in this paragraph is very uncertain. See
pp. 134, 252, 304 of the text.

<span id="fn_356"></span>[170:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_364.md) From the Book of

<span id="fn_359"></span>[175:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_367.md) On this sentiment
Mr. Trenckner calls attention to the analogous phrases at Dhammapada,
verse 223.

<span id="fn_360"></span>[175:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_368.md) Sînapattâ: which
the Si*m*halese renders polo talehi kal gewî patra wœ*t*îma*t*a
pœminiyâwu w*ri*kshayo.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[175:3](sbe3512.htm#fr_369.md) Fabulous beings
supposed to occupy these fabulous waters.

<span id="fn_362"></span>[176:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_370.md) This conception of
the earth resting on water and the water on air is Indian, and forms no
part of distinctively Buddhist teaching.

<span id="fn_363"></span>[176:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_371.md)
Mahati-mahâ-pariyogo; not in Childers nor in the Sanskrit Petersburg
Dictionary. Hîna*t*i-kumburê renders it itâ mahat wu mahâ bhâ*g*anayak.

<span id="fn_364"></span>[177:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_372.md) Ummâ-puppha;
rendered diya-me*nd*iri-pushpa in the Si*m*halese. Clough gives
diyameneri as a plant 'commelina cucullata.'

<span id="fn_365"></span>[177:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_373.md) 2 Sirîsa-puppha;
rendered mârâ-pushpa in the Si*m*halese, mârâ being the seed of the
'adenanthera pavonia.'

<span id="fn_366"></span>[177:3](sbe3512.htm#fr_374.md) Suriya-kanto, which
the Si*m*halese merely repeats.

<span id="fn_367"></span>[177:4](sbe3512.htm#fr_375.md) *K*anda-kanta; and
so also in the Si*m*halese. These are mythic gems, supposed to be formed
out of the rays of the sun and moon respectively, and visible only when
they shine.

<span id="fn_368"></span>[177:5](sbe3512.htm#fr_376.md) The Si*m*halese has
ka*gg*opakramaya, which is not in Clough.

<span id="fn_369"></span>[177:6](sbe3512.htm#fr_377.md) Masâra-galla, which
the Si*m*halese renders by masâra-galya, which Böhtlingk-Roth think is
sapphire or smaragd, and Clough renders 'emerald,' and the commentary on
the Abhidhâna Padîpikâ, quoted by Childers, says is a stone produced in
the hill of Masâra (otherwise unknown).

On similar lists of gems elsewhere see the *K*ullavagga IX, 1, 3, and my
note at pp. 249, 250 of the 'Buddhist Suttas' (vol. xi of the 'Sacred
Books of the East').

<span id="fn_370"></span>[177:7](sbe3512.htm#fr_378.md) So also in the
Mahâ-Sudassana Sutta I, 32, translated in the 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 256.
Compare above, [p. 35](sbe3503.htm#page_35.md) of the text.

<span id="fn_371"></span>[178:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_379.md) There is here a
long paragraph in the Si*m*halese omitted in the Pâli.

<span id="fn_372"></span>[178:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_380.md) Nibbâhana; rendered
abhiwarddhiya in the Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_373"></span>[179:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_381.md) The story is given
at length in the Sivi *G*âtaka, No. 499 (vol. iv) pp. 401-412 of
Professor Fausböll's edition).

<span id="fn_374"></span>[179:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_382.md) There is nothing in
the text of the *G*âtaka (p. 410) of the new eyes being 'divine' or
'from heaven.' There new, ordinary eyes arose to him as the result of
his virtue.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[179:3](sbe3512.htm#fr_383.md) Sa-kasata*m*.
'Kasa*t*a cannot mean simply 'insipid' as Dr. Edward Müller suggests at
p. 43 of his 'Pâli Grammar,' for it is opposed to dullness, insipidity
(manda) at A<u>n</u>guttara II, 5, 5. It must mean there 'wrong, not
only by omission, but by commission.' Compare its use in the Dhammapada
Commentary, p. 275; *G*âtaka I, 108, II, 97; and in the commentary on
the Puggala IV, 24. Mr. Trenckner points out in his note that it is
often written saka*t*a, and is no doubt the same as the Sanskrit word so
spelt, and given by Wilson. (It is not in Böhtlingk-Roth.)

<span id="fn_376"></span>[179:4](sbe3512.htm#fr_384.md) I don't know which
Sutta is referred to.

<span id="fn_377"></span>[180:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_385.md) This paragraph is
very different in the Si*m*halese, and much longer than the Pâli.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[180:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_386.md) See the beautiful
story of the Holy Quail (translated in my 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' p.
302), where even so weak a creature as a baby quail is able, by such a
mystic Act of Truth, to drive back the great and powerful Agni, the god
of fire, whom the Brahmans so much feared and worshipped.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[181:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_387.md) 'One who knows a
powerful charm (or perhaps Vedic verse, mantra),' says Hîna*t*i-kumburê.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[181:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_388.md) Sa*kk*a, literally
truth. (Satya-gâyanâ in the Si*m*halese.)

<span id="fn_381"></span>[183:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_389.md) That is to say, in
the words of the Quail story (loc. cit. p. 305), she 'called to mind the
attributes of the Buddhas who had passed away, and made a solemn
asseveration of the faith' that she had in the truth they had taught.

<span id="fn_382"></span>[183:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_390.md) Anummatto, which
the Si*m*halese translates as a feminine.

<span id="fn_383"></span>[184:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_391.md) *Kh*innikâya.
Compare *G*âtaka II, 114, and the Sutta Vibha<u>n</u>ga on Pâ*k*ittiya
26.

<span id="fn_384"></span>[185:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_392.md) This idea of the
power of an Act of Truth which Nâgasena here relies on is most
interesting and curious. The exact time at which it was introduced into
Buddhism is as yet unknown. It has not been found in the Pi*t*akas
themselves, and is probably an incorporation of an older,
pre-Buddhistic, belief. The person carrying it out is supposed to have
some goodness, to call that virtue (and perhaps, as in the case of the
quail, the goodness of the Buddhas also) to mind, and then to wish
something, and that thing, however difficult, and provided there is
nothing cruel in it, then comes to pass. It is analogous to the mystic
power supposed to reside in names. Childers very properly points out
that we have a very remarkable instance of an Act of Truth (though a
very un-Buddhistic one) in the Hebrew book of the Kings II. i. 10. 'And
Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty: "If I be a man of God,
then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty!"
And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.' A
great point, both in this legend and in the story of the quail, is that
the power of nature to be overcome is one looked upon by the Brahmans as
divine.

Pa*ñk*a-padhâna<u>n</u>gani. This is curious. In the Pi*t*akas there are
four kinds only.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[189:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_398.md) There is a
paragraph here in the Si*m*halese not found in the Pâli.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[190:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_399.md) Li<u>n</u>ga,
possibly 'uniform.' Either the Order or the yellow robe, for instance,
if the system were Buddhism. See below, IV, (*?--JBH*)

<span id="fn_392"></span>[191:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_400.md) See *K*ullavagga
VII, 3, 9.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[191:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_401.md) See Mahâparinibbâna
Sutta IV, 21.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[191:3](sbe3512.htm#fr_402.md) Mahâvagga VIII, 1,
30-33.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[191:4](sbe3512.htm#fr_403.md) This is, no doubt,
the occurrence recounted in the Mahâvagga VI, 17, 1-4. Childers
translates vâtâbâdha by 'rheumatism,' but I adhere here to the
translation adopted there. It is said in the Mahâvagga that Ânanda gave
him, not hot water, but gruel. But the two are very similar, and in the
Theri Gâthâ 185, referring to the same event, it is hot water that is
mentioned.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[191:5](sbe3512.htm#fr_404.md) That is, there can
be no suffering without sin. Compare the discussion in St. John's
Gospel, ch. ix.

<span id="fn_397"></span>[192:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_405.md) As was pointed out
above, IV, 1, 33, many of these medical terms are very doubtful.

<span id="fn_398"></span>[193:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_406.md) So below, IV, 3,
28.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[193:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_407.md)
Visama-parihâra-*g*â both in the Si*m*halese and the Pâli.

<span id="fn_400"></span>[194:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_408.md) Water, fire, air,
and earth (âpo, te*g*o, vayo, pa*th*avî).

<span id="fn_401"></span>[196:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_409.md) Pa*t*isallâ*n*a
(not samâdhi), rendered throughout in the Si*m*halese by wiweka.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[196:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_410.md) I have not been
able to find this statement in any of the Pi*t*aka texts.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[196:3](sbe3512.htm#fr_411.md) Here again our
author seems to be referring to a tradition later than the Pi*t*akas. In
the Mahâvagga (see our version in the 'Vinaya Texts,' vol. i, pp. 74-81)
there is mention only of four periods of seven days, and even during
these not of pa*t*isallâ*n*a, but of samâdhi. The former of these two
terms only occurs at the conclusion of the twenty-eight days (Mahâvagga
I, 5, 2). Even in the later orthodox literature the period of meditation
is still not three months, but only seven times seven days. See the
passages quoted in Professor Oldenberg's note at p. 75 of the 'Vinaya
Texts,' vol. i.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[198:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_412.md) *K*attâro
iddhi-pâdâ.

<span id="fn_405"></span>[199:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_413.md) Mahâparinibbâna
Sutta III, 60, translated in my 'Buddhist Suttas,' pp. 57, 58.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[199:2](sbe3512.htm#fr_414.md) Ibid. III, 63,
translated loc. cit. p. 59.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[199:3](sbe3512.htm#fr_415.md) So it is said of
the 'Horse-treasure' of the Great King of Glory in the Mahâsudassana
Sutta I, 29 (translated in my 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 256), that 'it
passed over along the broad earth to its very ocean boundary, and then
returned again, in time for the <span id="page_200">p. 200</span>
morning meal, to the royal city of Kusâvatî.' It is, of course, the sun
horse which is meant.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[200:1](sbe3512.htm#fr_416.md) I have not traced
this quotation in the Pi*t*akas, but it is probably there.
