## CHAPTER VII.

### Cula.

 

   <span id="pp_1"></span>1. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Jetavana, the garden of
Anâthapindika.

   Now at that time the venerable Sâriputta was instructing, arousing,
animating and gladdening the venerable Dwarf Bhaddiya with manifold
religious discourses.

   And thus instructed, aroused, animated and gladdened by the mainfold
religions discourses of the venerable Sariputta, the heart of the
venerable Dwarf Bhaddiya was set free from 'attachment' and the sins.

   And the Blessed One perceived that the heart of the venerable
Bhaddiya was set free from 'attachment' and the sins, through the
manifold religious discourses of the venerable Sâriputta.

   And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed
forth this solemn utterance:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">

<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>   "Above, below, in every respect emancipated,<br />
   Perceiving that there is no 'Ego',<br />
   Such a one, free, has crossed the flood, not crossed before,<br />
   And is reborn no more."<br />

One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Jetavana, the garden of Anâthapindika.

   And the venerable Sâriputta thinking that the venerable Dwarf
Bhaddiya was yet but a novice, instructed, aroused, animated and
gladdened him with manifold religious discourses.

   And the Blessed One perceived the venerable Sâriputta instructing,
arousing, animating and gladdening the venerable Dwarf Bhaddiya (whom he
thought yet a novice) with manifold religious discourses.

   And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion breathed
forth this solemn utterance:

   This is the end of sorrow".<br />

   <span id="pp_3"></span>3. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Jetavana, the garden of
Anâthapindika.

   Now at that time a number of men were living at Savatthi and all of
them were in bondage to the passions, inflamed, glutted, seized and
infatuated to excess with lust, falling into sin and impregnated with
lust.

   And a number of Bhikkhus, robing themselves in the forenoon and
taking their alms-bowls and tunics entered Savatthi for alms, and when
they had returned from their rounds in Savatthi and finished their meal,
they went to where the Blessed One was, and drawing near, they saluted
the Blessed One and sat down apart and while <span id="page_104">p.
104</span> thus sitting they said to the Blessed One: "at this time,
Sire, a number of men are passing their days in Savatthi, in bondage to
the passions etc. \[as above. *Transl*.\]."

   And the Blessed One in this connection, on that occasion, breathed
forth this solemn utterance:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>

<tr class="odd">
<td>   "These are beings inflamed with lust,<br />

   Who perceive no evil in the 'fetters'.<br />
   Verily these who are bound by the fetters of human passion,<br />
   Cross not the great and mighty flood<br />
   (of evil which overwhelms humanity.)"<br />

Anâthapindika.

   At that time a number of men were living at Savatthi, and all of them
were in bondage to the passions, inflamed, glutted, seized and
infatuated to excess with lust, falling into sin, blinded and
impregnated with lust.

   And the Blessed One, robing himself in the forenoon and taking his
alms-bowl and tunic entered Savatthi for alms.

   <span id="pp_5"></span>5. Thus have I heard, On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Jetavana, the garden of
Anâthapindika.

   Now at that time the venerable dwarf Bhaddiya, following step by step
in the wake of a large number of Bhikkhus, came to where the Blessed One
was.

   And when the Blessed One beheld the venerable dwarf Bhaddiya, coming
along in the wake of the Bhikkhus, ill-favored, evil to behold, lowly in
gait and despised by the majority of the Bhikkhus, he called the
Bhikkhus to him and said: "Behold, O Bhikkhus, this mendicant
approaching from afar, ill-favored, evil to behold, lowly in gait, and
despised by the majority of Bhikkhus,"

   "Even so, Sire."

   "This mendicant, O Bhikkhus, is mighty in power, great in strength:
this state of perfection, not formerly attained by this Bhikkhu, is not
easily attained; for the sake of which scions of noble family abandon
their homes for homelessness and by themselves in this very existence,
through the higher knowledge, realize and attain to that supreme
consummation, the holy life."

   And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed
forth this solemn utterance:

   "The cart rolls on, on one wheel only,  
   But faultless in body, canopied in white:  
   So, see this (miserable dwarf) coming along;  
   He has conquered sorrow, cut off the streams of lust,  
    <span id="page_106">p. 106</span> And freed himself from the bonds
(of the desire of future life)."  

 

   <span id="pp_6"></span>6. Thus have I heard. On a certain occassion
the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Jetavana, the garden of
Anâthapindika.

   Now at that time the venerable Annâtakondanna was sitting not far
from the Blessed One, in a cross-legged position, with body erect
contemplating the deliverance that comes through destruction of desire.

   <span id="pp_9"></span>9. Thus have I heard. At that time the Blessed
One, in company with the Brotherhood, was traversing the Malla <span
id="page_108">p. 108</span> country and he came to Thuna, a Brahman
village, in the Malla country.

   And the Brahman housholders of Thuna, on hearing that the Samana
Gotama--he who had gone forth from a Sakya family--was traversing the
Malla country in company with the Brotherhood and had arrived at Thuna,
they filled up the well to the brim with grass and straw, so that these
shaven monks, as they called them, should not obtain water to drink.

   And the Blessed One, leaving the road, went to the foot of a tree and
drawing near sat down on the appointed seat and while thus sitting he
said to Ananda: "Bring me, I pray, Ananda, some water from that well."

   When these words had been spoken, the venerable Ananda said to the
Blessed One: "That well, Sire, has been filled up to the brim with grass
and straw by the Brahman housholders of Thuna, so that we, shaven monks,
as they call us, may not obtain water to drink."

   A second time the Blessed One said to the venerable Ananda: "Bring
me, I pray thee, Ananda, some water from that well."

   A second time the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: 'That
well, Sire, has been filled up etc. \[as above. *Transl*.\].

   A third time the Blessed One said to the venerable Ananda: "Bring me,
I pray thee, Ananda, some water from that well."

   "So be it, Sire" said the venerable Ananda in assent to the Blessed
One and he went to the well, taking with him a bowl.

   And when he arrived at the well he found that all the grass and straw
had been removed and that it was full <span id="page_109">p. 109</span>
to the brim, even to overflowing, of pure, clear, translucent water.

   And the thought occurred to the venerable Ananda: "How astonishing,
how marvellous is the mighty power and great strength of the Perfect
One, that on my arrival all the grass and straw were removed and the
well was full to the brim, even to overflowing, of clear, pure,
translucent water."

   And taking some water in the bowl, he went to where the Blessed One
was and said to the Blessed One: "How astonishing, how marvellous, is
the mighty power and great strength of the Perfect One, by which the
grass and straw was removed etc. \[as above. *Transl*.\].

   Drink, Exalted One, of the water: Drink, Happy One, of the water."

forth this solemn utterance:--

   <span id="pp_10"></span>10. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt in the Ghosita garden, at Kosambi.

   Now at that time the palace set apart for the royal ladies in the
garden of King Udena was burnt down and 500 women perished with Sâmâvati
at their head.

   And a large number of Bhikkhus robing themselves in the forenoon and
taking their alms-bowls and tunics entered Kosambi for alms. And when
they had gone their rounds and finished their meal, they went to where
the Blessed One was and drawing near they saluted the Blessed One <span

they said to the Blessed One: "Just now, Sire, the palace set apart for
the royal ladies in the garden of King Udena was burnt down and 500
women perished with Sâmâvati at their head. Whither have these female
votaries departed, and what will be their future condition?"

   "There are, O Bhikkhus, some lay disciples who have entered the
stream, some who return (to this world) once again, some who never
return. All these lay disciples who perished are not without reward."
