## PREFACE.

   The Pali Version of this small collection of stories and sentences
has not, I understand, been translated into English before. Several
passages, however, occur in the Cullavagga, Mahavagga and Maha
Parinibbâna Suttas and have been translated in the "Sacred Books of the
East."

   I publish this translation, not with any pretensions to proficiency
in Pali, but as a tribute of love to the memory of the noble Gotama,
who, to use the striking language of Dr. Oldenberg, stands forth as the
most prominent of the world's physicians that traversed India in
monastic garb,--the Exalted, the Holy, the highly Illuminated One, who
came into the world to show to gods and men the way out of this
sorrowful prison-house of being, into the freedom of everlasting rest.

D. M. S.
