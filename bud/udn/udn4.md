## CHAPTER IV.

### "Meghiya."

 

   <span id="pp_1"></span>1. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt at Calaka, on the Calaka mountain.

   Now at that time the venerable Meghiya was the servitor of the
Blessed One. And the venerable Meghiya went to where the Blessed One was
and drawing near, he saluted the Blessed One and stationed himself
respectfully apart, and while thus standing the venerable Meghiya said
to the Blessed One: "I wish, Sire, to enter the village of Jantu to go
on my rounds for alms."

   "Very well, Meghiya, do as you think fit."

   And the venerable Meghiya clothing himself in the forenoon and taking
his alms-bowl and tunic entered the Jantu village for alms. And when he
had gone his rounds and finished his meal, he went to the banks of the
Kimikâla-river and as he wandered on foot from place to place along the
banks of the river, he beheld an enchanting and delightful Grove of
Mango-trees. And when he saw it, he exclaimed: "How beautiful, how
lovely is this Mango Grove! Truly this is a fitting place for a scion of
noble family to struggle and strive (after holiness). If the Blessed One
consents, I will return to this Mango Grove and there struggle and
strive (after holiness)."

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

   And the venerable Meghiya went to where the Blessed One was and
drawing near, he saluted the Blessed One and sat down respectfully apart
and while thus sitting, he said to the Blessed One: "In the forenoon,
Sire, having put on my garments and taking my alms-bowl and tunic, I
entered the Jantu village for alms, and when I had gone my rounds and
finished my meal, I went to the banks of the Kimikâla-river and
wandering on foot from place to place I beheld an enchanting and
delightful Grove of Mango-trees and when I saw it, I exclaimed: 'How
lovely, how beautiful is this Mango Grove! Surely this is a fitting
place for a scion of noble family, to struggle and strive (after
holiness)'. If the Blessed One will consent, I will return to this Mango
Grove and struggle and strive (after holiness)."

   "If, Sire, the Blessed One consents I will go to that Mango Grove and
enter into the struggle."

   When these words had been spoken, the Blessed One said to the
venerable Meghiya: "Wait, for the present, Meghiya, we are alone now, at
least till some other Bhikkhu arrives."

   And a second time the venerable Meghiya spoke to the Blessed One,
saying: "No further duties, Sire, have to be performed by the Blessed
One, no further experience is needed, but I, Sire, have duties still to
perform, and experience to gain. If, Sire, the Blessed One consents, I
will go to that Mango Grove and enter upon the struggle."

   A second time, the Blessed One said to the venerable Meghiya: "Wait a
while, Meghiya, we are alone now, at least till some other Bhikkhu
arrives."

   A third time the venerable Meghiya said to the Blessed One: \[As
above. *Transl*.\].

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

   "As to the struggle, Meghiya, in what terms shall I declare it to
you? Do now, Meghiya, as you think best."

   And the venerable Meghiya arose from his seat and saluted the Blessed
One and passing round keeping his right side to him, he went to where
the Mango Grove was, and drawing near he entered the Mango Grove and sat
down during the heat of the day at the foot of a tree.

   And while living in that Mango Grove, the venerable Meghiya was
constantly assailed by three kinds of evil and unlawful thoughts, namely
lustful thoughts, malicious thoughts, and cruel thoughts.

   And the venerable Meghiya thought to himself: "How strange is it, how
marvellous is it, that I, who through faith have abandoned my home for
the homeless state, should be filled with these these evil and unlawful
thoughts, namely, lustful thoughts, malicious thoughts, and cruel
thoughts."

   And the venerable Meghiya arose from his solitary communings and went
to where the Blessed One was and having saluted the Blessed One, he sat
down respectfully apart and while thus sitting he said to the Blessed
One: "while living in that Mango Grove, Sire, I was assailed by three
evil and unlawful thoughts, namely lustful thoughts, malicious thoughts
and cruel thoughts and I thought how strange, how marvellous is it, that
I who through faith have abandoned my home for the homeless state,
should be assailed by these three evil and unlawful thoughts.

   "For the immaturely released heart, O Meghiya, five conditions
conduce to maturity. What are these five?

   1°. In this world, Meghiya, a Bhikkhu should have a virtuous friend,
a virtuous companion. For the immaturely <span id="page_49">p. 49</span>
released heart, Meghiya, this is the first condition which conduces to
maturity.

   2°. Further, Meghiya, a Bhikkhu shonld be pious, should live a life
of restraint according to the precepts, and be endued with right
conduct, perceiving danger in the least of the sins, and adopting the
moral precepts, should exercise himself therein, For the immaturely
released heart, Meghiya, this is the second condition which conduces to
maturity.

   3°. Further, Meghiya, there should be discourses such as tend to the
eradication of evil, to a beneficial expansion of the heart, to an utter
weariness of the world, to the cessation of all desire, to tranquillity,
to the higher knowledge, to supreme enlightenment, to Nirvana, that is,
discourses on frugality, on contentment, solitude, exclusiveness, effort
and exertion, piety, self-concentration, wisdom and emancipation as
resulting from insight acquired by knowledge--by means of such
discourses satisfaction is obtained, and trouble and difficulties
overcome.

   For the immaturely released heart, Meghiya, this is the third
condition which conduces to maturity.

   4°. Further, Meghiya, the Bhikkhu should live a life of effort and
exertion, abandoning unlawful practises, he should practise what is
lawful, he should be resolute, put forth his strength, not throwing down
the burden in the practise of those things that are lawful.

   For the immaturely released heart, Meghiya, this is the fourth
condition which conduces to maturity.

   5°. Further, Meghiya, the Bhikkhu should have wisdom, should be
endowed with a knowledge of the 'rise and set' of things, of sublime
penetration, and of that which leads to the complete cessation of
sorrow.

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

   For the immaturely released heart, Meghiya, this is the fifth
condition which conduces to maturity.

   For the immaturely released heart, Meghiya, these are the five
conditions which conduce to maturity.

   Thus, Meghiya, when the Bhikkhu has provided himself with a virtuous
friend, a virtuous companion, a virtuous associate, it is to be expected
that he will become pious, that he will live a life of restraint
according to the precepts and be endued with right conduct, and seeing
danger in the least of the sins, will adopt the moral precepts and
exercise himself therein; and those discourses which tend to the
eradication of evil, to a beneficial expansion of the heart, to an utter
weariness of the world, to the cessation of all desire, to tranquillity,
to the higher knowledge, to supreme enlightenment, to Nirvana, namely,
discourses on frugality, contentment, solitude, exclusiveness, effort
and exertion, piety, self-concentration, wisdom and emancipation
resulting from insight acquired by knowledge--by the means of such
discourses satisfaction is obtained and trouble and difficulties
overcome.

   Thus the Bhikkhu with a virtuous friend, a virtuous companion, a
virtuous associate will live a life of effort and exertion, and
abandoning unlawful practises will practise what is lawful, he will be
resolute, put forth his strength and not throw down the burden in the
practise of what is lawful.

   Thus the Bhikkhu with a virtuous friend, a virtuous companion, a
virtuous associate, will become wise, will be endowed with a knowledge
of the 'rise and set' of things, of sublime penetration, and of that
which conduces to the complete cessation of sorrow.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

   Moreover, Meghiya, the Bhikkhu who holds to these five conditions,
must give special attention to four other conditions; in order to
abandon lust he must dwell on the impurity (of the body), in order to
forsake malice he must dwell on kindness, with a view to the excision of
(evil) thoughts, he must practise meditation by (counting) inhalations
and exhalations; for the removal of the pride which says 'I am', he must
exercise himself in the consciousness of the impermanency of all things.
By the consciousness of impermanence, the consciousness of non-egoity is
established, and he who is conscious of non-egoity succeeds in the
removal of the notion 'I am', and in this very existence attains to
Nirvana."

   And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed
forth this solemn utterance:--

   <span id="pp_2"></span>2. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt at Kusinara, in the Upavattana, the Sâl forest of
the Mallas.

   Now at that time there lived, not far from the Blessed One, a great
number of Bhikkhus in huts set up in the forest.

   They were puffed up, proud, fickle, garrulous, loose in <span
id="page_52">p. 52</span> their talk, thoughtless, without knowledge,
unrestrained, scatter-brained and sensuous.

   And the Blessed One beheld these Bhikkhus living in huts set up in
the forest, puffed up, fickle, garrulous, loose in their talk,
thoughtless, without knowledge, unrestrained, scatter-brained and
sensuous.

   <span id="pp_3"></span>3. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion,
the Blessed One with a large gathering of the Brotherhood, was wandering
about from place to place in the Kosala-country. Now at that time the
Blessed One having left the road, went to the foot of a tree and sat
down on the appointed seat.

   And a certain herdsman approached the Blessed One, and drawing near,
saluted the Blessed One and sat down apart and as the herdsman sat
there, the Blessed One, instructed, animated, incited and gladdened him
with righteous discourse.

   And the herdsman, instructed, animated, incited and gladdened by the
righteous discourse of the Blessed One <span id="page_53">p. 53</span>
said: "May it please the Blessed One and the brethren to take their
morrow's meal with me?"

   And the Blessed One assented by his silence.

   And the herdsman, perceiving that the Blessed One had assented, arose
from his seat and saluted the Blessed One, and passing round keeping his
right side to him, he departed. And the herdsman at the end of that
night having caused to be prepared in his own house an abundance of
gruel and butter-milk announced to the Blessed One that the time had
come saying: "Sire, the time is come, the meal is ready."

   And the Blessed One, robing himself in the forenoon and taking his
alms-bowl and tunic, went, together with the Brotherhood, to where the
herdsman's house was and when he arrived there, he sat down on the
appointed seat.

   And the herdsman with his own hands served and offered to the
brethren, with the Buddha at their head, the gruel and the butter-milk.
And when the Blessed One had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand
from the bowl, the herdsman taking a low seat, sat down respectfully
apart and while he was thus sitting, the Blessed One instructed,
animated, incited and gladdened the herdsman with righteous discourse.
And the Blessed One arose from his seat and departed. Not long after the
departure of the Blessed One, a certain man, (in a feud) connected with
a woman, took the life of the herdsman.

   And a number of Bhikkhus went to where the Blessed One was and
drawing near they saluted the Blessed One and sat down respectfully
apart, and while thus sitting, they said to the Blessed One: "That
herdsman it is said, Sire, who lately served and offered to the
Fraternity with <span id="page_54">p. 54</span> the Buddha at their
head, gruel and butter-milk, has been killed by a man, in connection
with some quarrel about a woman. And the Blessed One, in this
connection, on that occasion, breathed forth this solemn utterance:--

   <span id="pp_4"></span>4. On a certain occasion the Blessed One dwelt
at Râjagaha, in the Bambu Grove, in Kalandikanivapa.

   Now at that time the venerable Sariputta and the venerable Moggalana
the Great were living at the Kapotakandara monastery.

   And the venerable Sariputta while sitting, with lately shaven hair,
in the open air, on a moonlit night, fell into a trance.

   And two Yakkhas, who were associates, came from the north country to
the south country, to transact some business. And when these Yakkhas
observed the venerable Sariputta, sitting in the open air, in the
moonlit night, with lately shaven hair, the first Yakkha said to the
second Yakkha: "It occurs to me, friend, to give this Samana a blow on
the head." When these words had been spoken the second Yakkha said to
his friend: "Enough, friend, do not strike the Samana. A renowned man,
is this Samana, very powerful and mighty in magic."

   A second time the first Yakkha said to the second Yakkha: "It occurs
to me, friend, to give this Samana a blow on the head."

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

   A second time the second Yakkha replied: "Enough, friend, strike not
the Samana. A renowned man is this Samana, very powerful and mighty in
magic."

   A third time the first Yakkha said to the second Yakkha: "It occurs
to me, friend, to give this Samana a blow on the head."

   And a third time the second Yakkha replied: "Enough, friend. A
renowned man is this Samana, very powerful and mighty in magic."

   And the first Yakkha, not heeding the second Yakkha, delivered a blow
on the head of the venerable Sariputta; such a blow, moreover, as would
fell an elephant 7 or 7½ cubits high or crush a huge mountain peak. And
that Yakkha crying out, 'I burn, I burn', fell there and then, into the
great Hell.

   And the venerable Moggallana the Great beheld with his divinely clear
vision, surpassing that of men, the blow delivered by the Yakkha on the
head of the venerable Sariputta, and when he saw it, he went to where
the venerable Sariputta was and drawing near, said to him: "I trust,
brother, that you are at ease, that you are doing well, that there is no
pain."

   "I am at ease, brother Moggallana, and am doing well, but I feel a
slight pain in my head."

   "How strange is it, brother Sariputta! How marvellous is it, brother
Sariputta! How great is the magical power, how great is the might of the
venerable Sariputta!" Just now, brother Sariputta, a certain Yakkha
delivered a blow on your head, and how great was that blow! With such a
blow, indeed, one might fell an elephant 7 or 7½ cubits high and crush a
huge mountain peak. And the venerable Sariputta says: 'I am at ease,
friend Moggallana, <span id="page_56">p. 56</span> I am doing well,
friend Moggallana, I feel only a slight pain in my head'."

   "It is strange, brother Moggallana, it is wonderful, brother
Moggallana--how great must be the magical power of the venerable
Moggallana, that he saw a Yakkha at all. I did not see even a
mud-sprite."

   And the Blessed One with his divinely clear hearing, surpassing that
of men, heard the conversation which took place between these two mighty
heroes.

   And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed
forth this solemn utterance:--

   <span id="pp_5"></span>5. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt at Kosambi in the Ghosita monastery.

   Now at that time the Blessed One was living surrounded by a crowd of
monks and nuns, of male and female lay disciples, of kings and their
ministers, as well as by heretical sects and their pupils, and he
suffered annoyance and discomfort.

   And this thought occurred to him: "Surrounded by a crowd of monks and
nuns, of male and female votaries, of kings and their ministers, as well
as by heretical sects and their pupils, I suffer annoyance and
discomfort. What if I were to live alone, remote from the crowd?"

   And the Blessed One robing himself in the forenoon and taking his
alms-bowl and tunic, entered Kosambi for alms. Having perambulated
Kosambi for alms, he returned from <span id="page_57">p. 57</span> his
rounds and after finishing his meal, he himself put in order his
sleeping place, and taking his alms-bowl and tunic, and without
informing his servitor or giving notice to the Brethren, he departed,
alone, without a companion, in the direction of Palileyyaka and
wandering from place to place he reached Palileyyaka and took up his
abode there.

   And the Blessed One sojourned in the dense grove Rakkhilâ, in the
vicinity of Palileyyaka, at the foot of the Bhadda Sâl tree.

   Now a certain noble elephant lived there, who was much inconvenienced
by a crowd of male and female elephants, young elephants and elephant
calves. He had to feed on blades of grass with their tips broken off,
and they ate the young branches which he himself had broken down. He had
also to drink water that had been polluted and when he plunged (into the
water) to cross over, the female elephants rubbed their bodies against
him. In consequence of this crowd he was annoyed and lived ill at ease.

   And this thought occurred to the noble elephant; "Surrounded by a
crowd of male elephants and she elephants, young elephants and elephant
calves, I have to feed on blades of grass with their tips broken off and
they eat the young branches I myself have broken down. I have also to
drink water that has been polluted and when I plunge (into the water) to
cross over, the female elephants rub their bodies against me. In
consequence of this crowd I am annoyed and live ill at ease. What if I
were to live alone, remote from the crowd?"

   And the noble elephant leaving the herd went to the deep groves of
Rakkhita, in the vicinity of Palileyyaka, to the foot of the Bhadda Sâl
tree, where the Blessed One <span id="page_58">p. 58</span> was. And
when he arrived there, he removed the grass from the spot which the
Blessed One occupied, and brought with his trunk drinking water for the
Blessed One.

   And as the Blessed One was rejoicing in the calm of solitude and
isolation, this thought arose; "Formerly, I lived a life of annoyance
and discomfort surrounded by monks and nuns etc. \[as above.
*Transl*.\]. Now no longer surrounded by monks and nuns etc. \[as above.
*Transl*.\]. I live in comfort and at ease."

   And in the mind of the noble elephant this thought arose: "Formerly,
I lived a life of annoyance and discomfort surrounded by male elephants
and she elephants etc. \[as above. *Transl*.\]. Now no longer surrounded
I live in comfort and at ease."

   And the Blessed One, with reference to his own solitude, and
perceiving what was passing in the mind of that noble elephant, breathed
forth this solemn utterance:--

   <span id="pp_6"></span>6. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Jetavana, the garden of
Anâthapindika.

   Now at that time the venerable Pindolabharadvâja was sitting, not far
from the Blessed One in a cross-legged position, with body erect. He was
a frequenter of forests, a recipient of alms, a weaver of clothes made
of rags taken from a dust-heap, possessor of the three garments of a
monk, content with little, satisfied, solitary, living apart <span

   <span id="pp_8"></span>8. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Jetavana, the garden of
Anâthapindika.

   Now at that time the Blessed One was held in reverence, honoured,
respected and esteemed, and was a recipient of the requisites of a monk
of the Order, such as robes, alms, pallet, and medicines in case of
sickness. The Brethren were also held in reverence, honoured, respected
and esteemed and were recipients of the requisites of a monk, such as,
robes, alms, pallet and medicines in case of sickness.

   The wandering monks of the heretical sects were not held in
reverence, etc. \[as above. *Transl*.\] and were not recipients of the
requisites, \[as above. *Transl*.\]. And these wandering monks of the
heretical sects could not endure the honour extended to the Blessed One
and the Brethren, and they went to where the wandering nun Sundari was
and drawing near they said to the wandering nun Sundari: "Is it in your
power, Sister, to do something for your relatives?"

   What am I to do, Sirs, what is it in my power to do? I am ready to
sacrifice my life for my relatives."

   "Then go at once, Sister, to the Jetavana."

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

   "Be it so, Sirs," said Sundari the wandering nun in assent to these
wandering monks of the heretical sects, and she went at once to the
Jetavana.

   And since these wandering monks of the heretical party knew that many
people living in the Jetavana<span id="page_61_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_61_note_1.md) would have an opportunity
of seeing the sudden arrival there of Sundari, the wandering nun, (they
went there themselves) and (secretly) depriving her of life, threw her
into a ruined well in the Jetavana. And they went to where the King
Posenadi Kosala was, and drawing near they said to the King Posenadi
Kosala; "great King, the wandering nun Sundari has disappeared."

   "Where then do you suspect she is?"

   "In the Jetavana, great King."

   "Then search the Jetavana."

   And those wandering monks of the heretical party searched in the
Jetavana, and taking (the body) out of the ruined well into which it had
been thrown, they placed it on a litter and brought it into Savatthi by
the carriage road, and when they reached the place where the four roads
meet, they caused a murmur amongst the people, by calling out: "Behold,
Sirs, the work of the Sakya sons, shameless are these Sakya sons,
impious, wicked, liars and depraved! They profess to be religious,
pious, holy, truth speaking, virtuous and good men! There is nothing of
the Samana in them, there is nothing of the Brahmana in them. There is
no meaning in their Samana-ship, there is no meaning in their
Brahmana-ship. Where is their Samana-ship, where is their Brahmana-ship?
For how would a man who fulfils the duty of a man, deprive a woman of
her life?" And the <span id="page_62">p. 62</span> people of Savatthi,
whenever they saw the Bhikkhus, reviled, abused, annoyed and worried
them by using harsh and improper language, calling out: "Shameless are
the Sakya sons, impious, wicked, liars and depraved!"

   And a great number of Bhikkhus, having robed themselves in the
forenoon, and taking their alms-bowls and tunics entered Savatthi for
alms. And when they had gone their rounds in Savatthi and returned from
receiving alms and finished their meal, they went to where the Blessed
One was, and drawing near they saluted the Blessed One and sat down
apart; and while thus sitting these Bhikkhus said to the Blessed One:
"Whenever the people of Savatthi see the Bhikkhus, they revile, abuse,
annoy and worry the Bhikkhus, by using harsh language and calling out;
"Shameless are these Sakya sons, etc. \[as above. *Transl*.\].

   "This uproar, O Bhikkhus, will not last long, it will last for seven
days and at the end of the seventh day, it will subside. Therefore, O
Bhikkhus, reprove those men of Savatthi, who, when they see you, revile,
abuse etc. \[as above. *Transl*.\], with these verses:

   And these Bhikkhus having learnt by heart these verses in the
presence of the Blessed One, reproved the men of Savatthi who reviled
them with the above verses \[abbreviation. *Transl*.\].

   And the people said to themselves: "These Samanas, <span
id="page_63">p. 63</span> these Sakya sons are unreasonable, we will
have no more to do with these Sakya sons."

   Thus the uproar did not last long, for seven days only did it last,
and at the end of the seventh day it subsided.

   And a number of Bhikkhus went to where the Blessed One was and
drawing near, they saluted the Blessed One and sat down apart, and while
thus sitting, they said to the Blessed One: "It is strange, Sire, it is
marvellous, Sire! How well spoken were those words of the Blessed One:
'This uproar will not last long, for seven days will it last, at the end
of the seventh day it will subside'. The uproar, Sire, has ceased."

   And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed
forth this solemn utterance:--

   He bears them with resignation."<br />

   <span id="pp_9"></span>9. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt at Râjagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, in
Kalandikanivâpa.

   And there arose in the mind of the venerable Upasena, the son of
Vanganta, this reflection, as he passed his days in solitude and
seclusion: "How great is my gain, how great to me the advantage, that I
have as Master, the Supreme Buddha, that I, under the discipline of the
Doctrine so well taught, have abandoned my house for the homeless state,
that I have, as holy companions, righteous and pious men, that I have
fulfilled the precepts, that I am steadfast, tranquil in mind, an Arahat
who has destroyed <span id="page_64">p. 64</span> the sins, great in
power, mighty in strength! Blessed to me is life, blessed is death!"

   And the Blessed One grasping with his own mind the thoughts that were
in the mind of the venerable Upasena, the son of Vanganta, in this
connection, on that occasion, breathed forth this solemn utterance:--

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">

   Who sorrows not at the approach of death,<br />
   If such a one is resolute and has seen Nirvana,<br />
   In the midst of grief, he is griefless.<br />
   The tranquil minded Bhikkhu, who has uprooted the thirst for existence,<br />
   By him the succession of births is ended,<br />
   He is reborn no more!"<br />

   <span id="pp_10"></span>10. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Jetavana, the garden of
Anâthapindika.

   Now at that time the venerable Sariputta was sitting, not far from
the Blessed One, in a cross-legged position, with body erect,
contemplating his own state of tranquillity.

   And the Blessed One beheld the venerable Sariputta sitting, not far
off, in a cross-legged position, with body erect, contemplating his own
state of tranquillity.
