## CHAPTER I.

### "The Enlightenment."

 

   <span id="pp_1"></span>1. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Exalted One, soon after the attainment of Buddhahood, dwelt at
Uruvela, on the banks of the stream Neranjara, at the foot of the tree
of Enlightenment. At that time the Exalted One, after remaining in a
sitting posture for seven days, experienced the joy of Emancipation.

   When the seven days had come to a close, the Exalted One arose from
the state of trance and in the first watch of the night, thoroughly
thought out the chain of cause and effect, in direct order, thus; "If
there is this (state), another (state) arises, by the arising of this
(state), a (state) is produced, that is to say:

   "From Ignorance<span id="page_1_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_1_note_1) spring Conformations, from
Conformations springs Consciousness, from Consciousness spring Mind
<span id="page_2">p. 2</span> and Material Form, from Mind and Material
Form, the six Organs of Sense, from the six Organs of Sense, Contact,
from Contact, Sensations, from Sensations, Desire, from Desire,
Attachment, from Attachment, Being,<span
id="page_2_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_2_note_1) from Being, Birth, from
Birth spring Decay, Death, Sorrow, Lamentation, Pain, Grief and Despair.
Thus the whole mass of suffering originates". And the Exalted One in
this connection, on that occasion, breathed forth this solemn utterance:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">

<tr class="odd">

   When he understands the nature of cause and effect,<br />
   Then all doubts depart."</td>

   <span id="pp_2"></span>2. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Exalted One, soon after the attainment of Buddhahood, dwelt at
Uruvela on the banks of the stream Neranjara, at the foot of the tree of
Enlightenment. At that time the Exalted One, after remaining in a
sitting posture for seven days, experienced the joy of Emancipation.

   When the seven days had come to a close, the Exalted one arose from
the state of trance, and in the middle watch of the night thoroughly
thought out the chain of <span id="page_3">p. 3</span> cause and effect,
in indirect order, thus: "If there is not this (state), another (state)
does not arise, by the non-arising of this (state), a (state) is not
produced, that is to say;

   By the destruction of Ignorance, Conformations are destroyed, by the
destruction of Conformations, Consciousness is destroyed, by the
destruction of Consciousness, Mind and Material Form are destroyed, by
the destruction of Mind and Material Form, the six Organs of Sense are
destroyed, by the destruction of the six Organs of Sense, Contact is
destroyed, by the destruction of Contact, Sensations are destroyed, by
the destruction of Sensations, Desire is destroyed, by the destruction
of Desire, Attachment is destroyed, by the destruction of Attachment,
Being is destroyed, by the destruction of Being, Birth is destroyed, and
by the destruction of Birth, Decay, Death, Sorrow, Lamentation, Pain,
Grief and Despair are destroyed. Thus the whole mass of suffering is
brought to an end.

   And the Exalted One, in this connection, on that occasion breathed
forth this solemn utterance:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>   "When the conditions of Existence dawn upon the strenuous, meditative Brahmana,<br />
   When he understands the destruction of the causes,<br />
   Then all doubts depart."</td>

   <span id="pp_3"></span>3. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Exalted One, soon after the attainment of Buddhahood, dwelt at
Uruvela on the banks of the stream Neranjara, at the foot of the tree of
Enlightenment. At that time the Exalted One, after remaining in a
sitting posture for seven days, experienced the bliss of Emancipation.

   When the seven days had come to a close, the Exalted <span
id="page_4">p. 4</span> One arose from the state of trance and in the
last watch of the night thoroughly thought out the chain of cause and
effect in both the direct and indirect orders. \[Repetition of formulæ.
*Transl*:\]. Now by the complete destruction of Ignorance, there is
cessation of Conformations. And the Exalted One in this connection, on
that occasion, breathed forth this solemn utterance:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">

<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>

<tr class="odd">

   He stands, scattering the hosts of the Tempter, as the Sun, diffusing its rays through space."</td>

   <span id="pp_4"></span>4. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Exalted One, soon after the attainment of Buddhahood, dwelt at
Uruvela on the banks of the Neranjara stream, at the foot of the
'Goat-herd's' Banyan tree. At that time, the Exalted One, after
remaining in a sitting posture for seven days, experienced the bliss of
Emancipation. And the Exalted One at the end of the seventh day arose
from the state of trance.

   Now a certain Brahmana of haughty disposition went to where the
Blessed One was and drawing near he saluted the Blessed One and after
exchanging with him the compliments of friendship and civility, he
stationed himself respectfully on one side and while thus standmg he
said to the Blessed One; "What, Lord Gotama, is the standard of
excellence for a Brahmana, and what is the nature of the works he should
perform?

   And the Blessed One in this connection, on that occasion, breathed
forth this solemn utterance:

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">

</td>

   <span id="pp_5"></span>5. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion,
the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi in the Jetavana, the garden of
Anâtha-pindika. At that time the venerable brethren Sariputta,
Mahamogallana, Mahakassapa, Mahakaccayana, Mahakotthita, Mahakappina,
Mahacunda, Anuruddha, Revata, Devadatta, and Ananda drew near to the
Blessed One. And the Blessed One beheld from afar the venerable brethren
approaching and when he saw them he called to his disciples and said;
"Behold, O Bhikkhus, these venerable Brahmanas approaching, behold, O
Bhikkhus these venerable Brahmanas drawing nigh."

   When these words had been spoken a certain Bhikkhu, by birth a
Brahmana, said to the Blessed One: "What is the standard of conduct
required of a Brahmana and what is the nature of the works he should
perform?"

   And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed
forth this solemn utterance:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">

   <span id="pp_6"></span>6. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt at Râjagaha in the Bambu Grove, in
Kalandika-nivâpa. At that time the venerable Mahakassapa abode in the
Pipphali cave and was stricken with a sore disease. <span id="page_6">p.
6</span> Subsequently the venerable Mahakassapa recovered from the
disease and when he was restored to health, this thought occurred to
him: "What if I were to enter Râjagaha in quest of alms?" Now at that
time there were some 500 Devas in attendance upon the venerable
Mahakassapa, who were zealously engaged in procuring alms for him. And
the venerable Mahakassapa, dismissing the 500 Devas, robed himself in
the forenoon and taking with him his alms bowl and tunic, entered
Râjagaha for alms and went to the slums, the streets of the poor and the
alleys where the weavers resided.

   And the Blessed One beheld the venerable Mahakassapa wandering about
in Râjagaha for alms, in the slums, in the streets of the poor and the
alleys where the weavers resided.

   And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed
forth this solemn utterance:

   <span id="pp_7"></span>7. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt at Pâtali, at the Ajakalâpaka monastery, in the
cell of the Yakkha,<span id="page_6_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_6_note_1) Ajakalâpaka. Now at that
time the Blessed One was sitting in the open air, the darkness of the
night was profound, and from a cloud there fell, one by one, drops of
rain. And the Yakkha, Ajakalâpaka, desirous of causing terror,
trembling, and horripilation to the Blessed <span id="page_7">p.
7</span> One, approached the Blessed One, and when he had arrived quite
close to him, he uttered three piercing shrieks, crying out, "This, O
Samana, is thy evil spirit." And the Blessed One, in this connection, on
that occasion, breathed forth this solemn utterance:

   <span id="pp_8"></span>8. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Jetavana, the garden of
Anâthapindika. At that time the venerable Sangamaji had arrived at
Savatthi to see the Blessed One.

   Now the old wife of the venerable Sangamaji heard that her lord,
Sangamaji, had arrived at Savatthi, so taking her child with her, she
went to the Jetavana.

   At that time the venerable Sangamaji was sitting at the foot of a
certain tree, enjoying a noonday rest. And the old wife went to where
the venerable Sangamaji was, and drawing near to him, said, "This, O
Samana,<span id="page_7_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_7_note_1) is thy little son, cherish
thou him."

   When she had thus spoken, the venerable Sangamaji remained silent. A
second and a third time she said: "This, O Samana, is thy little son,
cherish thou him." When she had thus spoken, the venerable Sangamaji
remained silent. Then the old wife, depositing the child in the presence
of the venerable Sangamaji, took her departure, saying: "This, O Samana,
is thy son, cherish thou him." And the venerable Sangamaji neither
looked at the child nor spoke to him. Then the old wife with the assent
of the venerable Sangamaji <span id="page_8">p. 8</span> withdrew for a
short distance, and when she saw that the venerable Sangamaji neither
looked at the child nor spoke to him, this thought occurred to her,
"This Samana cares not for his son", and turning away, she took her son
and departed.

   And the Blessed One, with divine vision, clear and surpassing that of
men, beheld this discomfiture of the old wife of the venerable
Sangamaji.

   And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed
forth this solemn utterance:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">

   <span id="pp_9"></span>9. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt at Gayasisa, near Gaya. At that time near the Gaya
there was a large concourse of ascetics, with matted hair, who, in the
icy winter nights, and in the early morning cold were emerging from and
plunging into the water near Gaya, anointing each other, and sacrificing
with fire--thinking by such means to obtain purification.

   And the Blessed One beheld these ascetics, with matted hair, emerging
from and plunging into the water near Gaya, anointing each other, and
sacrificing with fire, thinking by such means to obtain purification.

   And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed
forth this solemn utterance:

   "Purification cometh not by water, though the people bathe ever so
long;  
    <span id="page_9">p. 9</span> In whom truth and religion abide, that
man is pure, he is a Brahmana."  

 

   <span id="pp_10"></span>10. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Jetavana, the garden of
Anâthapindika. At that time Bahiya Daruciriya abode at Supparika, on the
seashore. He was respected, held in reverence, honoured and esteemed. He
was also a recipient of the requisites of a monk, namely, robes, alms,
bed and medicine in case of sickness. And this thought occurred to
Bahiya Daruciriya: "Am I not, indeed, one of those who are Saints in
this world, or, at least, one of those who have entered the path on the
way to Saintship."

   And certain Devas, former blood-relations of Bahiya Daruciriya, who
were compassionate and interested in his welfare, perceived with their
own minds the thought that occurred to Bahiya Daruciriya. They went to
where he was, and drawing near to him, said; "You, O Bahiya are neither
a Saint, nor have you entered the path which leads to Saintship. The
course which you pursue is not such that thereby you will become a
Saint, or enter the path which leads to Saintship. But there are, in
these days, both in this world and the world of gods, saints and those
who have entered the path which leads to Saintship. There is, O Bahiya,
in the north country, a city called Savatthi. There, at this very time,
dwells the Exalted One, that Saint, the Supreme Buddha: and that Blessed
One, that Saint, teaches the doctrine of Saintship." And Bahiya incited
by these Devas departed from Supparika and in the course of one night
reached Savatthi, where the Exalted One dwelt, in the Jetavana, the
garden of Anâthapindika. <span id="page_10">p. 10</span> At that time a
great number of mendicants were taking exercise in the open air. And
Bahiya went to where the mendicants were and drawing near said to them:
"Where tarries now, Reverend Sirs, the Exalted One, that Saint, the
Supreme Buddha? I am longing to see the Exated One, that Saint, the
Supreme Buddha."

   "The Exalted One, O Bahiya, has entered the inner courts to receive
alms."

   And Bahiya, trembling with agitation and departing from the Jetavana
beheld the Exalted One going on his rounds for alms in Savatthi--the
Lord, gracious, beautiful to behold, with senses stilled and mind
restrained, as one who has attained the supreme calm of self conquest,
subdued and guarded. And when he beheld him, he went to where the
Exalted One was and drawing near, he bowed his head in salutation at the
feet of the Exalted One and said: "Teach me, O Exalted One, the
doctrine; O happy One, teach me the doctrine, so that throughout the
length of my days it may conduce to my happiness and welfare." When
these words had been spoken the Blessed One said to Bahiya; "The time is
ill-chosen, I have entered the city for alms."

   A second time Bahiya Daruciriya said to the Blessed One: "It is hard,
Sire, to know to which of us death will first come; whether to the
Blessed One or to me; teach me the doctrine, O, Blessed One; O, Happy
One, teach me the doctrine, so that throughout the length of my days, it
may be for my welfare and happiness."

   A second time the Blessed One said to Bahiya: "The time is
ill-chosen, I have entered the city for alms."

   \[Bahiya addresses the Blessed One a third time, as above.
*Transl*.\]

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

   "Thus, O Bahiya, you should learn; of the seen, only a little is
seen, of the heard only a little is heard, of the thought only a little
is thought, of the known only a little is known; so, O Bahiya, it should
be learnt: in as much as of the seen only a little is seen etc., \[Text
here corrupt and commentary deficient. *Translator*\]; that is the end
of suffering."

   And the heart of Bahiya, by the concise exposition of the Doctrine by
the Blessed One, was freed from 'attachment' and the Sins. And when the
Blessed One had thus concisely admonished Bahiya, he took his departure.
Now it came to pass that soon after the departure of the Blessed One,
Bahiya was thrown down by a wild calf and killed. And when the Blessed
One had gone his rounds for alms and finished his meal for the day, he
left the city accompanied by a large retinue of Bhikkhus<span
id="page_11_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_11_note_1) and beheld Bahiya
Daruciriya lying dead. And he called the Bhikkhus to him and said;
"Take, O Bhikkhus, the body of Bahiya, place it on a bed, bear it away
and cremate it, and afterwards erect a mound over the remains--for this,
O Bhikkhus, is a fellow-saint who has died."

   "So be it, Sire", said the Bhikkhus in assent to the Blessed One. And
they took the body of Bahiya, placed it on a bed, bore it away and
cremated it and afterwards erected a mound over the remains.

   And they went to where the Blessed One was and drawing near they
saluted the Blessed One and sat down respectfully on one side and while
thus sitting these Bhikkhus <span id="page_12">p. 12</span> said to the
Blessed One; "The body of Bahiya, Sire, has been cremated and the mound
erected; whither has he gone and what will be his future state?"

   "A wise man, O Bhikkhus, was Bahiya; he practised the lesser duties
for the attainment of the highest state, he vexed me with no questions
concerning the Doctrine. Bahiya Daruciriya, O Bhikkhus, has ceased to
exist."

   And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed
forth this solemn utterance:--

<span id="footnotes_page_1">p. 1</span>

<span id="page_1_note_1"></span>[1](#page_1_fr_1) "Ignorance may be said
to be a primary cause only when it is made the starting point of a
discourse concerning the round of rebirth." (Visuddhi Magga. Chap.
XVII).

The Buddha's teaching in respect of continuity of identity and the
future condition after death is frequently expressed in terms of
Brahmanical metempsychosis and eschatology. Buddhism, however, only
entertains the notion of re-incarnation in the sense of a transference
of influences from one individual to another; and the various conditions
of punishment and reward in another world, so often alluded to in the
*Pitakas*, must be divested of the significance attached to them by the
Brahman community, to be properly understood. For instance, rebirth in
one of the <span id="footnotes_page_2">p. 2</span> many heavens, may be
compared to the influences of the philosopher Bruno, which, in his time,
had, as it were, no room to move, but which now live and move and have
their being in the minds of a multitude of admirers. Thus, Bruno is
reborn in a spacious and happy heaven of appreciation. A study of
Buddhistic philosophy makes it abundantly clear that such was the
meaning in the mind of the Buddha when he made use of pictorial
expressions, familiar to the people, to convey to them his doctrine of
the non-existence of a soul, as a permanent and immortal entity capable
of migration. (Vide also p. 28. note 1 {?}).
