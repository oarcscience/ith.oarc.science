The only ideal worth striving after is the ideal of a perfect life, here and now in this present world, in Saintship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                              | *<span class="small">The only ideal.</span>*        |

Salvation or Deliverance comes not by belief in the miraculous or by so-called supernatural agencies, but by knowledge and the keeping of the Precepts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                              | *<span class="small">Salvation.</span>*             |

Speculations as to existence or non-existence after death and all discussion as to ultimate soul-problems, starting from predicates of material form, were pronounced vain and unprofitable, because "they do not conduce to progress in holiness, because they do not contribute to peace and enlightenment.

|    The only continuity of identity of which we have any experience is the transition of the effects of the words, deeds and thoughts of an individual (by their embodiment in other sentient beings) to future generations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                              | *<span class="small">Karma.</span>*                 |
|    This process forms an essential part of the doctrine of Karma and tends to make the general idea of the perpetuation of character without identity of substance appear reasonable. The influences shed by one who has not stamped out desire for existence go, by the action of Karma, to produce in others that 'clinging to existence' which obstructs the way to deliverance from embodiment.<span id="page_vii_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_vii_note_1)                                                                          |                                                                                                                                              |                                                     |
|    In the case of the perfected saint, the Arahat, that particular function of Karma which produces this 'clinging to existence' ceases, because he has detached himself from all conditions good and bad.<span id="page_vii_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_vii_note_2) Karma in him has lost its fertilizing power and has become barren.

Ethics (P. XCIV); "The good is as a raft bearing one across the stream
of danger. It is not easy for us, who have learnt from Plato to call our
Absolute the good, and our ideal a Summum Bonum, to sympathize really
with this moral standpoint."
