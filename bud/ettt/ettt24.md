### THE VOW OF MAHĀMUDRĀ

### By <span class="smallcaps">Garmapa Rinchen Dorje</span>

With Commentary (in smaller type)

by the translator and

notes by the editor

##### 1

I pray to the Guru, to the Yidam, and to those holy beings in the
Mandala,  
I pray to the Buddhas and to their Sons (Bodhisattvas) in the Three
Times and in the Ten Directions,  
Remember me, have compassion and pity on me,  
Bless with accomplishment my wishes.

<span class="small">First, according to the traditions of Buddhist
Tantric ritual, a supplication is offered to one's teacher (who is
considered more important than the Buddhas), next to one's patron
Buddha, then to the Darginis, Guardians, and other beings of the Mandala
who grant protection and certain powers to the yogi. This supplication
to the esoteric or Tantric lineage is followed by one to the esoteric
lineage of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the past, present, and
future, and in all directions of space.</span>

##### 2

The pure action of my body and my mind  
My virtuous deeds and those of all sentient beings  
Are like clear streams flowing from the Snow Mountain  
  —devoid of the defilements of the Three Circles  
May they flow freely into the great ocean—  
  the ocean of the Buddha's Four Bodies.

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

<span class="small">The pure action of body and mind and the virtuous
deeds of sentient beings exist (pure in essence) only if one realizes
that the action, the doer, and the receiver (The Three Circles) are
alike empty and void. The unimpeded realization of this enables one to
merge with (obtain) the Four Bodies of Buddha, or the three-in-one—the
Dharmakaya, the Sambhogakaya, the Nirmanakaya, in the all-encompassing
(Tantric) Body of Universal Essence.</span>

##### 3

Until I attain the Four Bodies of Buddha,  
May even the name of Samsaric miseries [and](errata.htm#84) sins  
Be unheard in all my future lives  
While I [enjoy](errata.htm#85) the happy Dharma-Oceans.

<span class="small">It is a long journey from sentient being to
Buddhahood. Even a diligent and well-gifted person, after strenuous
efforts, may not attain Buddhahood in one lifetime, even though he
depends on Mahamudra which is considered an "Abrupt" or "Sudden
Enlightenment" teaching like that of Zen. Therefore, in Buddhist
countries, people are made mindful of this and taught to pray for
auspicious conditions and favorable environments in their future
incarnations.</span>

##### 4

May faith, intelligence, diligence and leisure,  
Good Gurus and the essential teachings come to me,  
May I practice rightly without stumbling and hindrances—  
The blessings of Dharma filling my future lives.

<span class="small">Mahamudra is not just philosophical. Without faith,
intelligence, diligence, favorable environment, and skilled teachers
there would be no base for its study and practice and no result for
sentient beings still existing in the realm of causation.</span>

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

##### 5

The Holy and Wisdom reckonings liberate me from ignorance  
The pith-instructions destroy my dark doubts forever  
Through the light from meditation, vividly and unmistakenly, I behold
Reality  
Increase, O Light of the Three Wisdoms!

Buddha taught that to judge rightly one should rely on the admonishments
of the Sutras and on one's own innate reason (the Holy and Wisdom
reckonings). By not leaning blindly on just one or the other, one is
less likely to err.

Some doubts can be dispelled through intellectual reasoning, but more
subtle and deeply intrenched doubts cannot be eliminated through
reasoning or study of the Sutras. These can only be destroyed by the
"pith-instructions"—the clear, precise, practical instructions given by
one's own Guru.

The real nature of mind can best be compared to the transparent
brightness of physical light. Here, however, the word "light" is also
used in a symbolic aspect to refer to the experience of the Three
Wisdoms of the Foundation (the undeveloped Buddha-nature in every
sentient being), of the Path (the partially realized Buddha-nature from
meditation practice), and of the Fruit (or full enlightenment).

##### 6

The Root-Principle is the Two Truths—the absence of the concrete and the
null views  
The superb Path is the Provisions—without either the exaggerating or
minimizing views  
The Fruit is the Two Benefits of neither Nirvana or Saṃsara  
In future life, may I meet such right teachings.

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

<span class="small">These three terms—Root or Foundation, Path, and
Fruit—are frequently used terms to explain the complete philosophy and
procedure of Buddhism, though in Hinayana, general Mahayana, and Tantric
Buddhism the terms Root, Path, and Fruit are applied differently. Here,
the author points out that the basis or "Root" of Mahamudra is the view
which transcends Yes and No, which goes beyond the truth of either
existence or non-existence. The Path of Mahamudra is knowing the mind in
its essence without either adding or deducting anything to its original
nature. The Fruit is Buddhahood, the realization which transcends the
concepts of both Nirvana and [Saṃsāra](errata.htm#86). This Fruit is
expressed in the Two Benefits—blessings accruing to oneself and
blessings bestowed on others.</span>

##### 7

The Essence of Mind is the Two-in-One—the void and radiant original
source,  
Mahamudra, the Diamond-Practice, is the Purifier  
The Purified are the flickering and insubstantial Blindness and
Defilements  
May I attain the immaculate Dharmakaya, the purified Fruit.

<span class="small">Mahamudra is called the "Diamond-Practice" because
it is held to be the *strongest* antidote for delusory thoughts and
worldly desires. To the sentient beings the Blindness (ignorance) and
Defilements (desires) appear real and substantial, but the enlightened
being knows them as insubstantial and nonexistent.</span>

##### 8

The View of Mahamudra lies in neither adding nor deducting from the
nature of mind  
Being mindful of this, (the View) without distraction, is the
root-action of Mahamudra  
Of all meditations, this is the highest practice <span id="page_295">p.
295</span>  
Let me always find this right teaching of the View, Action, and
Practice.

<span class="small">To understand the nature of mind is easy if one can
recognize it without making any mental effort, and grasp it
instantaneously as it is at this very moment. The practice of Mahamudra
lies in the constant awareness of this view. Other teachings using
visualization, mantras, and bodily and prana exercises must all employ
effort and are With Form. Compared to them, the practice of Mahamudra,
effortless and Without Form, is superb.</span>

##### 9

All Dharmas (manifestations) are the expression of mind  
The mind is of no-mind—void in essence  
Void, yet not extinct, it manifest all  
Let me observe this essence, and retain this immutable view.

<span class="small">Dharma: In Buddhism "Dharma" has two meanings. It
means "Doctrine" and is also a general term to include all "objects,
manifestations, and existences".</span>

##### 10

In our confusion, we consider the self-manifestation (which never came
into being) apparent in outer objects  
In our blindness, we hold the self-awareness to be the real ego  
Because of the Two Clingings, sentient beings wander in Saṃsara  
May I cut this root of Confusion and Blindness.

<span class="small">Two Clingings: 1) The Clinging of Ego—clinging to
the individual conditioned and continuously changing
consciousness</span>

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

<span class="small">as the ego. 2) The Clinging of Dharma—clinging to
objects and [manifestations](errata.htm#87) as real.</span>

##### 11

"Nothing really exists!" Buddha, himself, sees no existence  
"All is not empty!" since the causes of Nirvana and Saṃsara exist  
This, is the Middle Path of the Two-in-One, neither agreeing nor
contradicting.  
May I realize the discrimination-free Mind-essence.

<span class="small">One trying to understand Buddhism is often puzzled
by its apparently contradictory statements such as, "Everything exists,"
"Nothing exists," "There is an ego," "There is no ego," "Meritorious
deeds are beneficial," "Meritorious deeds do not exist." Such statements
can be understood only if one learns to think from the standpoint of
different categories of truth. For instance, in the Mundane category (or
point-of-view) everything exists; but from the standpoint of
Transcendental truth, nothing exists. <span
id="fr_29"></span>[\*](#fn_29) This distinction in Buddhist philosophy
between the Mundane and Transcendental views must be kept in
mind.</span>

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

##### 12

No one can describe *that* by saying, "This is it!"  
No one can deny that by saying, "This is not it!"  
Such is the Non-created nature of Being which transcends the realm of
Consciousness  
May I attain, decisively, this uttermost truth.

<span class="small">Because "the Non-created nature of
Being—Mind-essence" lies beyond the realm of words and thoughts, it is
indescribable; therefore, it can neither be affirmed nor negated.
Furthermore, this Mind-essence though beyond words and thought is,
nevertheless, all-pervading. Since it embraces all, no one can deny it
by saying of anything, "This is not the Mind-essence".</span>

##### 13

Ignorant of this, we drift in the ocean of Saṃsara  
If one realizes this essence, there is no other Buddha  
In the final truth, there is neither Yes nor No  
May I realize the Dharma-nature—the principle of Alaya!

<span class="small">The cause of Saṃsara is the Blindness—the
subject-object pattern of thought which does not exist in the
dualistic-free Mind-essence. Enlightenment or the attainment of
Buddhahood is nothing but the complete realization of this Mind-essence.
The experience of the final realm of truth lies beyond the opposites and
thoughts of Yes and No.</span>

##### 14

The manifestation is mind, the Voidness is also mind  
The enlightenment is mind, and the Blindness is also mind <span
id="page_298">p. 298</span>  
The springing of things is mind, and their extinction is also mind  
May I understand that all Increasing and Decreasing inhere in mind.

All activities, existences, experiences, Sangsaric or Nirvanic, all stem
from the mind. If one understands and realizes the mind, he understands
and realizes all.

'Increasing' and 'Decreasing' here means the two opposites: the purity
and defilement, the merits and sins, the enlightenment and blindness
etc.

##### 15

Unsullied by intentional practice or meditation-with-effort  
Away from the Worldly-Wind of distraction  
With no effort and correction, I rest comfortably on the natural state
of mind  
May I find the adroit and subtle teaching of Mind Practice.

<span class="small">The difference between Mahamudra and other types of
meditation is that in Mahamudra no meditation-effort and no correction
is employed; but in most other types of meditations such as visualizing
a subject, holding the breath, meditating on love and divine mercy a
mental effort is always required <span
id="fr_30"></span>[\*](#fn_30),</span>

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

<span class="small">concentration—choosing one and rejecting the
other—is always stressed, whereas in the practice of Mahamudra, no
effort whatsoever is required. After one has realized the essence of
mind, concentration or non-concentration, distracted thoughts and
Samadhi all become Mahamudra itself. Though for the beginners of
Mahamudra, the distractions are obstacles for their meditation, they
still should not '*intentionally* practice Mahamudra' or *meditate
Mahamudra with effort*. Because any effort or intentional practice helps
not but impedes the realization of Mind-Essence. Hence, to comfortably
rest on "the awareness of mind" and observe it is the key-instruction of
Mahamudra.</span>

##### 16

The waves of Thought-Flow—strong and weak, clear and dim—subside  
Without disturbance the River-of-Consciousness flows naturally  
Far from the mud of drowsiness and distraction  
Let the steady and immutable Ocean of Samadhi, absorb me!

<span class="small">The chief difficulty for the meditator arises from
the habitual flow-of-thought common to everyone and which, according to
Buddhism, has had this characteristic *flowing* nature from the very
no-beginning. Besides this uncontrollable and habitual thinking the two
chief obstacles hindering the meditator are drowsiness and distraction.
Only through the attaining of a steady Samadhi can these obstacles be
overcome.</span>

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

##### 17

Repeatedly contemplating the incontemplatable mind,  
Clearly discerning the indiscernable meaning,  
I forever eliminate the doubts of Yes and No  
Let me surely behold my original face.

<span class="small">"Original face"—A symbolic term denotes the original
Buddha-nature innate in every sentient being from the very no-beginning.
It is interesting to note that this term, "Original face", is widely
used in Chinese Zen as well as being found in the Mahamudra teaching of
Tibet. \[Here we have a fleeting reference to the all-important *gotra*
concept. See our introduction. Ed.\]</span>

##### 18

When I observe the (outer) objects, I find nothing but my own mind  
When I observe my mind, I find nothing but the Voidness  
Observing both mind and objects, free am I from the Two Clingings  
Let me realize the true nature of the illuminating Mind-essence.

<span class="small">In the first step of Mahamudra practice, the yogi is
taught to observe the outer objects and to keep on observing them.
Continuing in this, he will come to the actual realization (not merely
through belief or intellectual reasoning) that all objects are the
phenomenal reflections of mind. Then he is taught to observe the mind,
itself. From this continual observance, the yogi finally arrives at the
realization that mind, itself, is merely voidness. When the yogi
observes both mind and objects he is liberated from the Two
Clingings—the Clinging of Ego which is the subjective-illusory
conception of mind, and the Clinging of Dharma, which is the
objective-delusory conception of mind. When one realizes the
illuminating Mind-essence, one finds</span>

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

<span class="small">that neither ego nor objects exists. \[The two-fold
egolessness—of persons and of things—taught also in the Lankavatara
Sutra, one of the texts basic to Mahamudra and Zen. *Ed*.\]</span>

##### 19

Because *that* transcends the mind, it is called the Great Symbol  
Because *that* frees from the extremes, it is called the Great Middle
Way  
Because that encompasses all and embrace all, it is called the Great
Perfection  
Let me understand that knowing one is knowing all.

The Great Symbol (Tib. Pyag Rgya Chen Po) literally means "The Great
Hand-Seal," referring to the custom of ancient times when the Emperor
signed imperial edicts with the print of his hand. Mahamudra is like the
imperial law which was supreme in its own realm and came to be called
"The Great Symbol," being acknowledged as the teaching which could not
be violated and which surpassed all others.

Since Mind-essence is intrinsically apart from the subject-object
pattern of thought, the teaching of realizing the Mind-essence is in
this respect called the teaching of the Great Middle Way (Tib. Dwu Ma
Chen Po). Since Mind-essence intrinsically encompasses all and its
teaching is the [consummation](errata.htm#90) of all teachings, it is
called the Great Perfection (Tib. Rdzogs Pa Chen Po). If one succeeds in
practicing one teaching, no matter by what name it is called, he
succeeds in realizing all.

##### 20

With Clingings absent, the great bliss continuously arises  
With no form to cling to, the radiant light outshines the dark
hindrances <span id="page_302">p. 302</span>  
May I constantly practice the practice of no-effort—transcending mind  
The natural and spontaneous Non-Discerning.

The sufferings and miseries of sentient beings are the result of
'tensions' which are originated from the 'fundamental tension'. Buddhism
denominates this fundamental tension as 'clinging' (Tib. *atsin Pa*). If
one can eliminate, or even subdue this Clinging to some extent, a great
bliss or Nirvanic ecstasy will arise.

Hindrances cannot exist without being embodied in forms; therefore, if
the yogi can realize in his Mahamudra meditation that no forms
whatsoever exist at all, he automatically overcomes all hindrances.

Any effort, or intentional practice in Mahamudra meditation is
redundant, useless, and even harmful since the Mind-Essence is
ever-present and has always existed. The closest description one can
give of the experience of the enlightenment mind is the feeling of a
natural and spontaneous non-discriminating, subject-object-free
awareness.

##### 21

The craving for ecstasy and *good experience* in meditation naturally
dissolves  
The evil thoughts and blindness rest innately pure in Dharma-dhatu  
In the "ordinary mind" there is no loss or gain, no claim or disclaim.  
Away from words, let me realize the truth of Dharma Essence.

<span class="small">It is common for the yogi to cling to the rapture,
brightness, and pleasant visions and feelings experienced during
meditation-practice. Buddha, however, has warned that those who continue
to crave such experiences cannot liberate [themselves](errata.htm#91).
In practicing Mahamudra rightly, the yogi will find his craving for such
ecstasies diminish and finally dissolve.</span>

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

Dharma-dhatu may be translated as "the Universal Whole" in which evil
thoughts and virtues, blindness and enlightenment are innately
identical <span id="fr_31"></span>[\*](#fn_31).

There is a famous Zen story that once a monk asked the Zen master Chow
Chu, "What is Tao (reality or path)?" The master answered, "The ordinary
mind is Tao." This "ordinary mind" can be easily misunderstood as
referring to the ignorant and illusory mind of the ordinary person.
However, it really means the Mind-essence which the enlightened being
sees and which *is not a new mind* or something which is different in
essence from the common mind. The enlightened see mind as it is—natural,
common, and intrinsic. In this sense, Mahamudra denotes the Mind-essence
as "the ordinary mind" wherein one finds no loss or gain, no claim or
disclaim, since it excludes all discriminations and includes all
differentiations.

Before actually and directly realized the Mind-essence, whatever
philosophy or theories [one](errata.htm#92) holds ("Reality is one,"
"Reality is two," "Truth is this or that") are nonsense like 'Playwords'
of children. When one directly and actually realizes the Mind-essence,
he reaches the [world](errata.htm#93)-beyond or the state called here
"Away From Playwords."

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

##### 22

Not knowing their natures are identical with Buddha's  
Sentient beings wander endlessly in Sangsara  
To those misery-bound who have undergone endless sufferings  
May I forever pity \["Succour" would be a better translation then the
condescending "pity," we feel. *Ed*.\] them with the unbearable great
compassion!  
May I forever pity them with the unbearable great compassion!

##### 23

Right in that moment when the Great Compassion arises  
Emerges nakedly and vividly the Great Voidness.  
Let me always find this unmistakable Two-in-One Path  
And practice it day and night.

The teaching of Buddhism on Great Voidness and Great Compassion is not
rightly understood by most people. These two are, actually, one entity
[manifested](errata.htm#96) in two aspects. But to the Sangsaric beings,
these two are seemingly irreconcilable since in many characteristics
they seem opposed, the wisdom seems 'cold' while the compassion is
'warm'; the Voidness has no object while the Compassion demands an
object, etc. Only the Buddha and enlightened beings can merge the two,
or, more accurately speaking, realize and unfold the identicalness and
simultaneous-existing-nature of the two. Here the author points out that
the unmistakable sign of the experience of the enlightened being is that
during the moment of enlightenment, when the great Voidness is seen, the
Great Compassion automatically arises, or, in some cases, a great and
unbearable compassion, should it ever arise, will automatically bring
forth the emergence of the Great Voidness.

\[In this stanza is expressed the essence of the Buddhist Tantra: that
the Śunya (or prajñā) and active Love (or vajra)

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

<span class="small">must be and are forever joined at the heart of
reality. Here is the true inner meaning of the profound Yab-Yum
symbolism of the phrase "the jewel (or diamond, i.e. upāya, vajra) is in
the lotus (padma, śunya, prajñā)." In the terms of the Hindu Tantra,
with its emphasis on the formative center and energy, Śakta and Śakti
are forever united in a not indistinct, but rather in a dynamic polar
union. *Ed*.\]</span>

##### 24

With meditation-produced clairvoyance and other miraculous powers  
May I ripen all the sentient beings and adorn Buddha's Pure Land  
May I fulfill the compassionate vows of all Buddhas  
And eventually achieve the highest enlightenment and perfections.

##### 25

The power of the compassion of Buddha  
The power of the loving Bodhisattvas  
The power of all virtues and good deeds  
May I bind these powers into one great force  
By which the pure vow of mine  
And the benevolent wishes of others may be readily fulfilled!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_29"></span>[296:\*](ettt24.htm#fr_29) We most strongly
disagree with the translation of the idea that there is nothing that is
not Sūnyatā as "there is nothing that exists." Sūnyatā is by no means
non-existence (see our comments on notes 55 and 96). Until this is
clearly understood, Zen and Mahamudra will remain word-play, only
sparkling but unenlightening. Without experienced knowledge of the
nature of Sūnyatā no treatise on Mahamudra is very helpful, and with
such experiences, such treatises are [unnecessary](errata.htm#88) except
as confirmation. The transcendental view is not that "nothing exists,"
but rather that it is not true to say either "nothing exists" or
"everything exists." The view that there is [nothing](errata.htm#89)
that exists is the "Nihilistic Extreme" criticized in Tsong-kha-pa's
text of Nāropā. See note 95 and the text of page
[238](ettt17.htm#page_238). *Ed*.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[298:\*](ettt24.htm#fr_30) Here the translator
is repeating, and we fear incorrectly, a conversation between himself
and the editor, who pointed out to him that in the true meditation of
love (not "on" love, as it is a meditation without seed) there is a
spontaneous awakening and melting of Bodhi Heart, distinctively
characterized by the fact that no mental effort is required. The
translator, in saying here that mental effort is required in the
love-meditation, evinces that he did not apprehend either the editor's
meaning <span id="page_299">p. 299</span> or that meditation. Long
before the Buddhist Mahāmudra sect, the Hindu Tantra and the higher yoga
practice of Patanjali taught the effortless meditation—become part and
parcel of spontaneous living—"without seed" or partaking of the nature
of the unconditioned.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[303:\*](ettt24.htm#fr_31) Here we strongly
disagree; Dharma-dhātu may *not* so be translated; defilements and the
buddha-nature are not at all identical in the context of Dharma-dhātu,
much less innately so. If [they](errata.htm#94) were, and hence if
blindness and enlightenment were innately identical, there would be no
point in either the translator's translation or comments, nor indeed in
the existence of this or [any](errata.htm#95) other book. The expression
of the matter by the translator tends to confusion. We would rather see
it put that the essential Buddha-nature is the self-nature of all
things, and constitutes the ultimate reality stripped of all
manifestation, and even the ultimate substance of those manifestations
we call evil or defilements. It is important to point out, however, that
in the saṃsara, what is evil uses the innate nature parasitically, while
what is good tends to increase the explicit manifestation (nirmanakāya
forms) of the Buddha-nature.—*Ed*.
