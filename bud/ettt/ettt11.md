### CHAPTER TWO

### SPECIAL PREPARATIONS

The Jetsün Milarepa also said in his song:

"Good and evil do never fail  
 To bring about corresponding fruits;  
 Hence, one should be extremely careful to avoid evil deeds.  
 Even petty misbehaviours, one must forbid;  
 For the law of retribution never fails,  
 And the misery in the Lower Paths is hard to bear!  
 If anyone realizes not the faults of desire  
 And the consequences of pleasure,  
 He can never resign ardent longings!  
 Then, from the Samsaric Prison he has no way to escape.  
 One should therefore remind oneself:  
 All these desires are delusions!  
 Bearing this understanding in mind  
 One may work on the cure of the kleśas!"  
 If one remembers not the gratitude one owes  
 To the father- and mother-like sentient beings in the Six Paths,  
 One is liable to fall down to the Small Vehicle, (Hinayana).  
 Therefore one should foster great compassion,  
 And learn to nourish the Bodhi-Heart."

Milarepa said in another song:

"I am so much afraid of the Eight
Non-Freedoms[16](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:16)<span id="an_r_nar:16"></span>  
 That I [continuously](errata.htm#18) think of the faults of Saṃsara  
 And the transiency of beings! <span id="page_132">p. 132</span>  
 I submit myself completely to the care of the Three Precious Ones!  
 I strictly discipline myself in all karmic doings.  
 By repeatedly practising the Heart-for-Bodhi,  
 I dispel the enduring shadow of
Habitual-Thinking[17](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:17)<span
id="an_r_nar:17"></span>,  
 Realizing that all the manifestations are delusory magic  
 Of the Three Miserable Paths, I have no fear nor alarm!"

In view of these admonishments (by the celebrated masters), one ought to
work hard in the preparatory practices until one's mind is consolidated.
One should bear in mind that to complete a perfect journey, a clear
knowledge is needed of the route and what is required for the journey.
This is not a light matter. In fact, the most important and crucial of
all the teachings is the preparation work, or the "Common Foundation of
All Practice."

In the second group of teachings, the extraordinary
[preparations](errata.htm#19) for the Supreme Vehicle, there are also
two types of preparations, the general and the special. The general
preparation for the Supreme Vehicle means to attain a complete
initiation, and to observe the precepts of Tantra. I want to expound the
attainment of initiation first.

According to the tradition of the Marpa lineage, as demonstrated by
Me-sdon and Ngo-sdon[18](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:18)<span
id="an_r_nar:18"></span>, whoever aspires to the practice of the Arising
Yoga and of the Secret Doctrine Perfect
Yoga[19](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:19)<span id="an_r_nar:19"></span> must
first obtain the complete Four Initiations. When Milarepa first saw
Gambopa, he asked Gambopa whether he had obtained the complete
initiations before importing to him the teachings of the Six Yogas.
Gambopa said, "Like a fine copper utensil ready for filling with butter,
I am quite ready." Thereupon, Milarepa bestowed upon him the teachings
and Pith Instructions[20](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:20)<span
id="an_r_nar:20"></span>. Milarepa also urged Gambopa to encourage

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

the Bari Translator to come for initiations. Many instances like this
have been told.

The great master Pag-mo-grub-pa also considered the attainment of the
Four Initiations was necessary for the disciples. In accordance with the
teachings of these great masters of the Marpa Lineage in the past, a
disciple must have the complete Four Initiations before the bestowal of
Tantric teachings. This point is emphasized in many Tantras; for
instance, the *Second Ti-Li of the Mahāmudra Tantra* says:

"When the disciple starts to learn the teaching,  
 He should first try to obtain an initiation.  
 After the attainment of initiation,  
 He will then become a candidate  
 Capable of receiving the grand esoteric teachings!  
 "Without Initiations there will be no accomplishment!  
 If he grinds sand, no butter will ever come out of it.  
 If he has obtained no initiation  
 And unscrupulously relates the teaching of Tantra,  
 Both he and his disciples will go to hell immediately after their
deaths,  
 Even if they are accomplished beings!  
 Therefore, all diligent persons should look for a Guru for Initiation."

The *Second Tantra of Rdor-bred* says:

"The most important matter is initiation;  
 All the accomplishments depend on it.  
 I now tell you this essential truth;  
 To it, you should pay first attention.  
 When one intends to be a follower of Tantra,  
 One should first attain a perfect initiation.  
 Having attained this initiation, one is thus <span id="page_134">p.
134</span>  
 Capable of practicing the Perfecting Yoga!  
 If a disciple has all knowledge about Tantra  
 But never attained the initiation,  
 Both he and his followers will fall into the great hell!"

Both the acquisition of the Pith-Instructions, and (the transformation
from common capacity to) the competency-in-Tantra depend on initiation.
Therefore, initiation is the root of all accomplishments. Without
initiation, no matter how diligently one may strive, he will achieve no
accomplishments whatsoever. Also, there is a definite danger that both
the guru and disciples are liable to fall into hell.

The *Tantra of Bde-mchog* says:

"If a Tantric Yogi who desires to practice a certain  
 Yoga, has never seen the Mandala,  
 All his efforts will be in vain,  
 As a man trying to beat the sky with his fist,  
 Or a fool taking the mirage for water."

According to these sayings, the disciples should first be sent into the
Mandala and given the complete Water and Crown Initiations. This is
necessary, for if one depends on the Partial Initiation, such as the
consecration from one particular Buddha and the fragmentary performance
of initiation, it can only be considered a preparatory work preceding
the "real, complete Initiation." Although there is no fault in depending
on the Partial or Concise Initiation, it is by no means sufficient. A
great and complete Initiation is necessary, as admonished in many
Tantras and by many learned and accomplished teachers.

Having attained the Initiation of
Hevajra[21](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:21)<span id="an_r_nar:21"></span>, if
one can also obtain the initiation of Bde-mchog, it will be very useful
to him, because these two teachings are very closely connected with each
other.

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

The explanation for the necessity of observing the Tantra precepts
follows.

During the ceremony when the Guru and all the Buddhas’
Sons[22](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:22)<span id="an_r_nar:22"></span> imparted
the initiation to the disciple, the disciple had sworn to observe the
precepts and to follow all the admonishments. Having been shown how the
precepts should be observed in the initiation ceremony, he was made
fully aware of his responsibilities. He should observe the precepts
accordingly. As said in the basic *Tantra of Bde-mchog:*

"The experts in Dhyana, the advanced Yogis,  
 Should always observe their precepts carefully.  
 Whoever violates the Tantric precepts  
 Will never accomplish anything in Mandala,  
 He will attain no Siddhis whatsoever."

The Tantra of *Mnyam-sbyor (Balanced Actions)* says:

"If one has never entered the Mandala,  
 If one violates one's oaths,  
 If one knows not the esoteric Pith-Instruction,  
 No matter how hard one practices,  
 There will be no accomplishment!"

It is clearly stated that if the disciple has not entered the Mandala
and obtained the initiation, or if he does not observe the precepts and
know the teaching of the Two Steps of the Arising Yoga thoroughly, he
will never attain any accomplishments—even if he practises a long time.

If he has attained the teachings of the Highest Division of Tantra and
claims to be a Tantric Yogi, he must know the Fundamental and Secondary
Precepts of Tantricism[23](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:23)<span
id="an_r_nar:23"></span>. Therefore, he should discipline himself well
and observe the precepts carefully.

After these general preparations we now consider

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

special preparations, which are the supreme preparation practice. After
the disciple has learned the necessary [supreme](errata.htm#20)
preparation practices such as the general virtuous deeds, the attainment
of Initiation, and the observation of Tantric Precepts, he should then
begin the essential Tantric practice: the *Guru Yoga*, *Vajrasattva
Yoga*, and the *Mandala Offering Performance*. Based upon the
traditional sayings of the Gurus in the past, the explanation of the
Vajrasattva Yoga and the Guru Yoga follows:

Vajrasattva Yoga is designed for cleansing the sins and removing the
obstacles of the disciples, while the Guru Yoga is designed for the
bestowal of blessing and grace on the disciples. First, the Vajrasattva
Yoga:

He should earnestly devote himself to taking refuge in the Three
Precious Ones like a hunted prey. He should also think of his fellow
men, the infinite sentient beings, who are drowned in the ocean of
suffering with him. As a matter of fact, they were all once his own
mothers[24](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:24)<span id="an_r_nar:24"></span>. Hence
he should remind himself of the immense debt of gratitude that he owes
them—think how much work has to be done by a mother to bring up a child;
think how a mother protects her child from dangers, illness, hunger. By
constantly bearing such thoughts in mind, a resolute will to benefit the
mother-like sentient beings will arise in one's heart. Then he should
think further that all the seeming pleasures they may enjoy in Saṃsara
will end in vanity and pain, and he should make a fervent oath: "I will
bring all happiness by all possible means to sentient beings. I will set
them free from all sufferings and unhappiness." He realizes that to
materialize this wish there is no other way but to look for attainment
of Buddhahood; thus a genuine Heart-for-Bodhi may arise within him. He
fully understands that it is for

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

the sake of sentient beings that he hopes for the Supreme Enlightenment
and practices the Yoga of this Tutelary Buddha—Vajrasattva. The Tantra
of the Essence of Adornment says:

"He (Vajrasattva), who is the body of all Buddhas,  
 Sits on the Moon Wheel upon the white lotus  
 Holding the Thunderbolt and Bell with all ornaments.  
 A devotee should visualize the Vajrasattva in this manner.  
 He should also practice the Incantation of the Hundred
Words[25](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:25)<span id="an_r_nar:25"></span>  
 For twenty times in one performance.  
 By doing this, even the sinful ones will be blessed."

Those accomplished masters also said:

"In between the meditation periods  
 One should recite the incantation.  
 If one recites it one hundred thousand times, one's sins will be
completely purified."

This means if he practices the Hundred Words Incantation of Vajrasattva
twenty-one times in the interval of meditation periods, his
transgressional sins in the Yoga practice will not grow; if he recites
the incantation one hundred thousand times, his sins will all be
cleansed. Thus one should practice this Yoga according to the following
procedure.

Visualize a white lotus on the top of your head. In the center of the
lotus is an *Ah* word which is transformed into a Moon Wheel. Upon the
Moon Wheel stands a *Hūṃ* word, which transforms into a Thunderbolt, and
from this Thunderbolt's lower part a *Hūṃ* word radiates infinite beams
of light (by which the Two Acts[26](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:26)<span
id="an_r_nar:26"></span> are performed). It shines forth reaching to the
Buddha's Pure Land and

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

renders offerings and services. Then it returns and shines downwards
into the lower Lokas to relieve the sufferings of the sentient beings.
Then the light retracts to the *Hūṃ* word and instantaneously becomes
the [Buddha](errata.htm#21) Vajrasattva—his body is white, his right
hand holds a Thunderbolt, and his left hand holds a bell. He also holds
the Mother Buddha, the White Mother of Elegance. She has all the
ornaments adorning her body and holds the Curved Knife and Human Skull.
Her beauty and elegance are beyond description. She sits in a Lotus
Posture and her body bears the thirty-two glorified marks and eight
subsidiary signs of Buddha's body. In the Mother's heart lies a moon,
upon which the white *Hūṃ* word radiates infinite light to the Buddha's
land inviting the Wisdom Buddha to come down. When the Wisdom Buddha
descends, remember to perform the Five Offerings and say *Tsa Hūṃ Boṃ
Hoo*—to consolidate the Buddha. And, from the Mother's heart, the light
again emanates to invite all the Buddhas in the universe to come down.
You should earnestly pray them to grant you the Initiation. Then think
that from all the nectar-filled vases held in the hands of all the
Mother Buddhas, there begins to flow out the nectar to fill your body.
Thus the Initiation is given to you. Meanwhile you should recite: *Aum
Sarwa Da Ta Ga Da Ah Bi Ke Gada Samaya Shir Ye Hūṃ!* After the
initiation, the over-flowing nectar gathers over your head and
crystallizes into an image of the immutable Buddha (Me Gy Ba) to adorn
your head. Thereupon, with the greatest sincerity of your body, mouth,
and mind, you should pray as follows:

"O! Bhagavat Vajrasattva! Pray cleanse all the sins and transgressional
evils of mine and of other sentient beings!"

Moved by your sincere prayer, Buddha Vajrasattva

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

radiates beams of light from his heart, which shine upon the bodies of
all sentient beings in the cosmos; thereby, their sins and hindrances
are cleared. The light again shines forth to the Buddha's Pure Land,
rendering service and offerings, and finally collecting the merits of
Buddha's body, mouth, mind, virtue, and performance before retracting to
the *Hūṃ* word. Having been enforced by the merits of all the Buddhas,
the Vajrasattva becomes more grandiose, powerful, and compassionate.
Circling the *Hūṃ* word in his heart-center is the following sacred
incantation:

*Oṃ Ba-tsa Heruga Samaya Manubabaya Heruga Delobaditsa Dri Dor Mabawa
Sudokayo Mabawa Subodayo Mabawa Ah Hu Rado Mabawa Sarwa Sidhi Mebaryatsa
Sarwagarma Su Tsame Tse Dar Shirya Guru Hūṃ Ha Ha Ha Ha Ho Bhagavan
Bentsa Heruga Mamemutssa Heruga Bava Mahasamaya Satta Ah Um Pai!*

When reciting the incantation, you should visualize the
incantation-circle rotating on and on. As the speed of the rotation
steadily increases, beams of light emanate from this incantation-spin
and shine upon the bodies of all sentient beings, cleansing their sins
and removing obstacles. The light again travels to the myriads of
Buddha's Pure Land, rendering offerings to the Buddhas and gathering the
wave of grace <span id="fr_7"></span>[\*](#fn_7) from Buddha's body,
mouth, and mind before returning to the incantation letters. (Through
this inspiration) a stream of pure nectar begins to flow out from the
body of Vajrasattva. It flows into your body through the Pure Gate on
the top of the head, until the whole body is full of nectar. At the same
time, this incoming stream of nectar washes away all filthy and putrid
matters—

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

which symbolizes the sins. One should think that through the pores over
all the body the filthy matters, representing the sins and kleśas, are
squeezed out and washed away. The body is filled with nothing but the
pure and clean nectar. Thereupon, with a confidence of benefiting others
and self, you should recite the incantation. When the recitation is
finished, the devotee should apply the principle of the Four Mighty
Ways[27](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:27)<span id="an_r_nar:27"></span> to
confess all his sins and wrong doings to Buddha. Then he should think
that all his sins of the Three Wheels[28](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:28)<span
id="an_r_nar:28"></span>—the sin, sinner, and the act of sin—are
cleansed thereby.

(At the end of this meditation) the Yogi reads the following prayer:

"O my protector! Because of my ignorance and desires  
 I have committed certain transgressions and evil deeds.  
 My Guru, my refuge! Save me and protect me!  
 O my lord, the one who holds the immutable Vajra!  
 Thou art the essence of great kindness and compassion!  
 The supreme lord of all, in whom I take refuge!"

After reciting this prayer, Buddha Vajrasattva smiles at him and says,
"Good man, your sins, transgressions, and hindrances are all cleared."
Then the Buddha Vajrasattva transforms himself into great light and
enters into the body of the disciple. Then the disciple should think
that his body, mouth, and mind are united and identified with the Buddha
Vajrasattva. At the end of this meditation, the disciple should dedicate
the merits and make an expression of good wishes toward all sentient
beings.

In order to obtain blessing and grace from the Guru, the instructions
for the practice of Guru Yoga are given as follows:

1\. To view the Guru as the Field of
Merits[29](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:29)<span id="an_r_nar:29"></span>.

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

2\. To serve and revere the Guru.

1\. The disciple should think that in the [firmament](errata.htm#22) in
front of him there is a lion-shaped seat of gems with lotus-moon
cushions upon it. On this sits his own Guru, who is the embodiment of
the Thunderbolt-Holder, the Great Rdo-rje-chang, the Primordial Buddha
of the Six Buddhas[30](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:30)<span
id="an_r_nar:30"></span>. His blue body has one face and two arms. His
right hand holds the Thunderbolt and his left hand holds the bell. With
heavenly clothes and jewels adorning his body, he embraces the Mother
Buddha in a Lotus-Sitting posture. From his body radiates resplendently
the five-colored aura. On his forehead is a moon and a white *Oṃ* word,
at his throat there is a lotus and a red *Ah* word, in his heart there
is a sun and a blue *Hūṃ* word. From these three words emanate beams of
light shining forth to the Buddha's Pure Land and inviting the great
Rdo-rje-chang and all the Gurus in the lineage to descend here. They all
enter the disciple's body and become unified with the disciple.

As said in the *Tantra of Sdom-abpung:* "Guru is the Buddha, Guru is the
Dharma, Guru is also the Sangha…" One should thus regard his own Guru as
the embodiment of the Three Refuges. The *Five Steps Tantra* also says:

"The self-born Bhagavan  
 He who is the supreme heaven of all.  
 He gives the teaching and Pith-Instructions.  
 But there is one who is superior even to the Bhagavan,  
 He is the actual teacher, one's own Guru of Vajrayana."

According to these sayings one must regard one's own Guru as much more
important even than the Great Buddha, for only through him can one be
benefited. As Buddha says:

"When the appropriate time comes, I shall embody myself

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

in a proper person. Whoever serves him will be blessed, his sins and
transgressions cleansed."

This convinces us that whenever we serve the Pith-Instruction-Giver, our
Guru, all the Buddhas will embody themselves in him to accept the
offerings and to purify the disciples’ sins. In the ordinary practice
when one renders the offerings to Buddha, no doubt he attains the due
merits of serving the Buddhas; however, he cannot be assured that the
Buddha will actually come and accept his
offerings[31](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:31)<span id="an_r_nar:31"></span>.
Therefore, we know that the very best Merit-Field is one's own Guru.
Thus, we should regard the Guru as the embodiment of all Tathagatas,
possessing all the merits. In this manner, a pure faith toward one's
Guru will grow. If a disciple thinks ill of his Guru or is faultfinding
towards his Guru, he is sure to encounter the hindrances in his quest
for enlightenment. If a disciple esteems and pays homage to his Guru, he
will soon attain the enlightenment. With this and other right manners
and considerations, one should think much of the gratitude that he owes
to his Guru and faithfully respect and venerate him.

2\. To serve and revere the Guru, as said in the Tantra of Five Steps:

"He should give up all other services and offerings  
 And concentrate on serving and offering to the Guru alone.  
 If his Guru is pleased,  
 The disciple will soon attain the All-Knowing Wisdom.  
 If the disciple serves and offers to his Guru  
 As he offers and serves the real Buddha,  
 What accomplishments and merits cannot he attain then?  
 What easier way to enlightenment can he find?"

One should know that among all the offerings and services,

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

these made to one's Guru are the best. Hence, with great faith, one
ought to make the best effort to serve one's Guru. The practice of
Mandala[32](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:32)<span id="an_r_nar:32"></span> (a
ritual of offering) is briefly expounded as follows: The Mandal, of clay
or gems, should be smeared with incense and the Five Nectars. The Yogi
then recite the invocation: *Oṃ Ba-tsa Bume Ah Hūṃ!* By reciting this
invocation the great iron wall is laid up. Within the enclosure of the
great iron wall are spread clusters of gorgeous flowers, from which
emanate the fragrance of perfume and the [agreeable](errata.htm#23) odor
of the Five Nectars. In the center of the earth looms the great Sumeru
Mountain; encircling the Sumeru Mountain are the Four Continents—the
East, South, West, and North; and between the continents are scattered
small islands. East of the Four Continents is a sacred elephant (The
Precious One); in the South, a sacred Family Overseer; in the West, a
sacred Supreme Horse; in the North, a sacred Girl Rinbochi; in the
Northeast, a sacred Warrior; in the Southwest, the precious Wheel; in
the Northwest, the precious Jewel; in the Southeast, a great treasury.
In the farther inner circle the sun, moon, planets, and stars are
situated in their respective locations.

"This great Mandal, which includes the entire wealth of the cosmos, is
now visualized clearly by my mind. Now I offer it in its entirety
together with all the pleasures, merits, and happiness of mine and
others in past, present, and future to the Gurus and Deities. I pray you
to pity me, to accept my offer, and to grant me your blessing." Thus the
yogi should pray. He should also render the Outer Offerings, the flowers
and so on; the Inner Offerings, the offerings of nectars; and the Secret
Offerings[33](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:33)<span id="an_r_nar:33"></span>.
Thus he should praise Buddha and take Tantric precepts, both

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

general and special, before his Guru. He should pray with earnestness
and respect to his Guru to grant him a speedy arising of the
understanding and realization of the Mundane and Transcendental Siddhis,
to keep him apart from obstacles and bring him to agreeable conditions
for his practice. Moved by this sincere prayer, the Guru is pleased.
Therefore, he radiates successively from the Three Words (*Oṃ Ah Hūṃ*)
the white, red, and blue lights which enter into the Three Places
(forehead, throat, and heart) of the Yogi in order and eventually fill
his body wholly. The defilements and sins of body, speech, and mind are
thus cleansed, and the Vase Secret and Wisdom Initiations are attained.

The Yogi should also think that he has attained the accomplishments of
the Three Vajras[34](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:34)<span
id="an_r_nar:34"></span>. Thereupon, from the Three Places of the Guru
simultaneously emanate the Three Lights. They enter into the body
through all the gates[35](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:35)<span
id="an_r_nar:35"></span>. By means of these lights, the subtle
defilements[36](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:36)<span id="an_r_nar:36"></span> of
the body, speech and mind are cleansed; the fourth initiation is thus
attained by the Yogi. The Yogi should think that he has attained the
Accomplishment of the Identity of the Three Vajras.

The Three Words (*Oṃ Ah Hūṃ*) are the symbol of the Three Vajras, having
the ability to cleanse the defilements of the three gates. Therefore, it
is permissible to consider that the three initiations are attained by
this practice. And inasmuch as the thought of attaining the Absolute
Fourth Initiation (Identity of the Three Vajras) is able to cleanse the
Subtle Defilements, thereby the Fourth Initiation is attained. However,
these so-called initiations are merely accepted for convenience and are
by no means the actual initiations.

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

"Thereupon, the Guru above and before me descends upon my head, enters
my body, and becomes one with me. Thus the Guru's body, speech and mind
are identical with mine." Thus the Yogi should think; and then he should
recite the Mantra of One Hundred Words to consolidate this unification.
This practice should be performed at the beginning and end of the
meditation, especially at the beginning.
