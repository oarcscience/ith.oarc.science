### NOTES

[1](ettt09.htm#an_r_nar:1.md)<span id="an_n_nar:1"></span>. *Three Faiths:*
The enumerative terminology of Buddhism becomes very complicated, so
that unless one belongs to a particular school it is not always possible
to say with certainty what terms like "The Three Faiths" and "The Four
Hindrances" refer to. Here it may be presumed, however, that the Three
Faiths refer to the disciple's progress in Buddhism through three
stages: Veneration (respect for Buddha and practice of the precepts);
Understanding (reached by studying Buddhist philosophy); and Realization
(highest personal attainment through practice of meditation and other
Yogic practices. Likewise in understanding the Six Yogas, the disciple
who hears of them, venerates them. Next, he gains the faith of
understanding by studying them. Third, he achieves the faith of
realization by practicing them. Hence, the relevance of calling the Six
Yogas also *The Book of the Three Faiths* \[or *The Book of Threefold
Faith* *Ed*.\].

[2](ettt09.htm#an_r_nar:2.md)<span id="an_n_nar:2"></span>. *Vajra Dhara:*
(Rdor-rje-chang, in Tibetan) lit. "Thunderbolt Holder." This is the
Buddha from whom all Tantric teachings originated, according to
tradition.

[3](ettt10.htm#an_r_nar:3.md)<span id="an_n_nar:3"></span>. *Supreme
Vehicle:* Tantric teachings, the Diamond Vehicle (Vajrayana). The term
"Tantricism" is not used in Buddhist countries, instead the terms
Hinayana, Mahayana, and for the esoteric teachings, Vajrayana, are used.

[4](ettt10.htm#an_r_nar:4.md)<span id="an_n_nar:4"></span>. *Paramita
Vehicle:* the Bodhisattva's Path; the esoteric teaching of the practice
of Mahayana Buddhism.

[5](ettt10.htm#an_r_nar:5.md)<span id="an_n_nar:5"></span>. *True Word
Vehicle:* Vajravana (Buddhist Tantricism); the esoteric teaching.
\[Literally "Thunderbolt Vehicle", associated with doctrines of sudden
enlightenment and the Short Path to liberation for those who take the
Kingdom by storm. The cognate Tibetan term rDo-rje connotes "Diamond,"
i.e. pure and irresistible.—*Ed*.\]

[6](ettt10.htm#an_r_nar:6.md)<span id="an_n_nar:6"></span>. *Lama
Rngog-pa:* One of the chief disciples of Marpa (See Biography of
Milarepa).

[7](ettt10.htm#an_r_nar:7.md)<span id="an_n_nar:7"></span>. Tantra of Two
Forms (Tibetan Stags-gnyis): The main Tantra of Hevajra.

[8](ettt10.htm#an_r_nar:8.md)<span id="an_n_nar:8"></span>. The implication
of this quotation is chat the student should advance step by step from
the practices of a novice serving

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

his guru until he understands the Doctrine of the Middle Way
(Madhyamika).

[9](ettt10.htm#an_r_nar:9.md)<span id="an_n_nar:9"></span>. *Goddess:* Lit.
the Sky-traveling-lady (Dakini), female angelic deity.

[10](ettt10.htm#an_r_nar:10.md)<span id="an_n_nar:10"></span>. *Three
Gradual Paths of Lam Rim:* Lam Rim (Steps to Buddhahood) was Tsong
[Khapa's](errata.htm#66.md) great contribution to Buddhist literature, in
which he pointed out the necessity for a *gradual* progress of the
disciple, beginning with the Lower Path (observation of ethics); through
the Middle Path (understanding of the Four Noble Truths); to the Highest
Path (observation of the Bodhisattva's Vow and Precepts).

[11](ettt10.htm#an_r_nar:11.md)<span id="an_n_nar:11"></span>. *Adisha* (A.
D. 980-1052): Famous Indian Buddhist who journeyed to Tibet and founded
the Bgha-gdams-b’a School.

[12](ettt10.htm#an_r_nar:12.md)<span id="an_n_nar:12"></span>. According to
Buddhist belief, the human embodiment is the best in which to work for
liberation, since the heaven-body is too blissful, whereas lower births
or embodiments are too full of suffering.

[13](ettt10.htm#an_r_nar:13.md)<span id="an_n_nar:13"></span>. *Dhayana:*
Buddhist term for a special psychic state of absolute concentration.

[14](ettt10.htm#an_r_nar:14.md)<span id="an_n_nar:14"></span>. Terms
referring to the illusory, non-real, and void nature of Samsaric
existence.

[15](ettt10.htm#an_r_nar:15.md)<span id="an_n_nar:15"></span>. The chief
aim of Mahayana Buddhism, to develop the Heart-for-Bodhi, includes two
aspects: (1) the wish or pure desire for this state, called
"Wish-for-Heart-of-Bodhi"; and (2) the vow to practice to achieve this
aim. "Practice-for-Heart-of-Bodhi."

[16](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:16.md)<span id="an_n_nar:16"></span>. *Eight
Non-Freedoms:* Conditions in which it is impossible to practice
Buddhism, such as falling into the realms of hell, hungry ghosts, or
animals; being born at a time when there is no Buddha, or before a
Buddha begins preaching, or in a country where there is no Buddhist
teaching; lacking the intelligence to understand Buddhism; becoming
absorbed in the Samadhi of non-form.

[17](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:17.md)<span id="an_n_nar:17"></span>.
*Habitual-Thinking:* The clinging of ego and the kleśas, is the cause of
all sufferings and Saṃsara, and has its roots in the peculiarly human
ceaseless, and automatic type of thinking (mentation).

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

[18](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:18.md)<span id="an_n_nar:18"></span>. *Mes-sdon
and Ngo-sdon:* Two chief disciples of Milarepa. Ngo-sdon is mentioned in
Milarepa's biography.

[19](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:19.md)<span id="an_n_nar:19"></span>. *Arising
Yoga:* The first stage of Yoga; Perfect Yoga is the final or complete
stage. The purpose of the Arising Yoga is to bring the mind and body to
perfect control and to set the mind upon the practice of *visionary*
concentration. The Perfect Yoga emphasizes the transformation of the
body and mind. It is a final psycho-physical practice.

[20](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:20.md)<span id="an_n_nar:20"></span>.
*Pith-Instructions:* The essential practical key directions for Yogic
practice communicated privately from Guru to disciple.

[21](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:21.md)<span id="an_n_nar:21"></span>. *Hevajra and
Bde-mchog:* names of two important Tantric Buddhas.

[22](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:22.md)<span id="an_n_nar:22"></span>. *Buddha's
Sons:* The Bodhisattvas.

[23](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:23.md)<span id="an_n_nar:23"></span>. *The
Fundamental Precepts:* Contain Fourteen Rules; the Secondary Precepts
are the so-called Eight Transgressions.

[24](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:24.md)<span id="an_n_nar:24"></span>. According to
the philosophy of reincarnation, in endless cycles of rebirths every
sentient being is related as parent to child.

[25](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:25.md)<span id="an_n_nar:25"></span>. The
incantation of Vajrasattva, which comprises one hundred words.

[26](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:26.md)<span id="an_n_nar:26"></span>. *The Two
Acts:* Offering self to Buddha, and offering self for the liberation of
sentient beings.

[27](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:27.md)<span id="an_n_nar:27"></span>. *Four Mighty
Ways:* (1) Public confession of one's past wrongdoings; (2) Taking an
oath never to repeat these wrong acts; (3) Performance of meritorious
deeds; (4) Meditation on *Śūnyatā*.

[28](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:28.md)<span id="an_n_nar:28"></span>. The sin,
sinner, and act of sin are likened to wheels turning about and keeping
the world of Saṃsara in manifestation.

[29](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:29.md)<span id="an_n_nar:29"></span>. Offerings
are more than acts of reverence. According to the law of Cause and
Effect, one reaps merits through sowing offerings. The more enlightened
the recipient, the greater the blessing; hence, the Buddhas and Gurus
are the best Fields of Merits for the disciples.

[30](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:30.md)<span id="an_n_nar:30"></span>. *Six
Buddhas:* In most Tantric mandalas these are deities of the four
directions and of the center, together with the [all
encompassing](errata.htm#67.md) primordial Buddha Rdo-rje-chang, making six
in all.

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

[31](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:31.md)<span id="an_n_nar:31"></span>. The
translator does not agree with Tsong [Khapa's](errata.htm#68.md) reasoning
here, since it implies that a Buddha may refuse to accept a sincere
offering. This would mean that the Buddha could be less than
all-compassionate, an impossibility. \[The sense of the text, however,
rather appears to be not that the Buddha would refuse to accept any
offering, but that there is no necessity that the Buddha will or should
make a special miraculous appearance in a personal nirmanakāya (body of
transformation) to do so, when the yogi's guru, who is already
personally accessible, can act as just such a vehicle or
channel.—*Ed*.\]

[32](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:32.md)<span id="an_n_nar:32"></span>. *Mandal:* a
bowl-like utensil, symbol of the universe, which is offered to Buddha.
The treasure in it are symbols of the most perfect wealth and gifts of
heaven and earth.

[33](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:33.md)<span id="an_n_nar:33"></span>. *The Inner
Offerings and Secret Offerings:* The Inner Offerings are the bliss and
enlightenment produced in the Tantric meditation—the meditation with
breathing and physical exercises. The Secret Offerings are the highest
bliss and ecstasy produced by the Third Initiation.

[34](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:34.md)<span id="an_n_nar:34"></span>. *The Three
Vajras:* The perfecting of body, speech, and mind. *Vajra* may be
translated as *Diamond*, meaning the strongest most precious; here, it
means the highest perfection.

[35](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:35.md)<span id="an_n_nar:35"></span>. *All the
Gates:* all the pores of the body, in addition to the nine chief
gates—two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, the mouth, the anus, and the sex
organ.

[36](ettt11.htm#an_r_nar:36.md)<span id="an_n_nar:36"></span>. *Subtle
defilements:* According to Mahayana Buddhism these are the subtle, or
fine, *Clinging of Dharma*, only to be destroyed in the Eight, Ninth and
Tenth *Bhumis* in the advanced stage of the Bodhisattva's path. (See
*Avatansaga Sutra and Yogacara Bhumi*.)

[37](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:37.md)<span id="an_n_nar:37"></span>. These names
are the title of the sub-schools or branches of Kagyutpa (the White
School, or the School of Marpa.)

[38](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:38.md)<span id="an_n_nar:38"></span>. This
quotation from the *Tantra of G’ye-rdo-rje* is incomplete, being only a
part or the original stanza. It therefore can be given many different
interpretations.

[39](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:39.md)<span id="an_n_nar:39"></span>. *The Tantric
Yogi:* The original text is *Brtul-zugs-chans*, meaning literally "the
one with oath."

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

[40](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:40.md)<span id="an_n_nar:40"></span>. *The Yoga of
Forms and Non-Forms:* This is not a perfect but an expressive
translation. The Tibetan term *Spros-pa* means "Nonsense" or
"Play-Words" which implies that all the conceptions and patterns of
human thought are relative and illusory; they are "play-words" when
applied to reality. For convenience, the translator has used the term
"Yoga of Forms," because in the practice of Arising Yoga one cannot free
oneself from conceptualism and symbolism. All visualizations,
recitations, and prayers practiced in the Arising Yoga have form, while
Mahamudra or the Yoga of Non-Forms transcends all these practices.

The reader may consider "The Yoga of Away-From-the Play-Words" and "The
Yoga with Play-Words" as alternative translations.

[41](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:41.md)<span id="an_n_nar:41"></span>. *Four
Castes:* the four castes of India.

[42](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:42.md)<span id="an_n_nar:42"></span>. *Four
Periods:* Morning, noon, afternoon, and evening. Here Tsong
[Khapa's](errata.htm#69.md) commentary is not explicit. The translator
presumes that he means that the Yogi meditates on a different part of
the body (corresponding to the Five Buddhas and their adornments) during
each of the four periods.

[43](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:43.md)<span id="an_n_nar:43"></span>. *"Sketchy
Visualization":* a general, non particularized mind-picture of the
tutelary deity.

[44](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:44.md)<span id="an_n_nar:44"></span>. *Tutelary
Pride:* to cure the Saṃsaric Pride-of-Ego, Tantricism teaches the yogi
to expand instead of abandon, as Hinayana Buddhism taught, this pride to
a cosmic scale—to the identification of one's self with Buddha, this
being the highest pride of all.

[45](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:45.md)<span id="an_n_nar:45"></span>. *Superb
Visions:* When the Yogi reaches this stage he no longer views the world
and its objects in the ordinary, common, Saṃsaric way but sees the outer
world as the Palace-Beyond-Measure and himself as the tutelary Buddha.

[46](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:46.md)<span id="an_n_nar:46"></span>.
*Bodhi-heart* means in this case, the male life-force or semen. Pad
symbolizes the stability and the union of the two forces (male and
female). <span id="fr_21"></span>[\*](#fn_21.md)

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

[47](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:47.md)<span id="an_n_nar:47"></span>.
*Mind-Functions:* Buddhism distinguishes between the mind and its
activity. Mind is that which acts, but the functions are the different
ways in which this mind manifests. According to Yogacara, the mind or
the No. 6 Consciousness has 51 mind functions.

[48](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:48.md)<span id="an_n_nar:48"></span>. *The
eighteen dhatus* (groups): The six outer-objects, the six sense-organs,
and the six consciousnesses.

[49](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:49.md)<span id="an_n_nar:49"></span>. *Ayatanas:*
The six places where the consciousnesses abide and the six objects
observed.

[50](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:50.md)<span id="an_n_nar:50"></span>. *Medrepa:*
The Guru of Marpa, an accomplished Indian Yogi.

[51](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:51.md)<span id="an_n_nar:51"></span>. The
philosophies of these schools are very complicated. Because of the
limitation of space, the translator cannot explain all their differences
here.

[52](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:52.md)<span id="an_n_nar:52"></span>. This is
[Tsong Khapa's](errata.htm#70.md) view and does not reflect that of Tibetan
scholars in general.

[53](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:53.md)<span id="an_n_nar:53"></span>. *Innate
Wisdom:* The perfect wisdom of Buddhahood, which is not made by humans
but is inborn in every sentient being.

[54](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:54.md)<span id="an_n_nar:54"></span>. This
complicated conception is unique in Tsong Khapa's philosophy. Tsong
Khapa's definition of the self-nature is very peculiar; his philosophy
of Middle-way is greatly different from those of the old schools and is
refuted \[rather, "opposed," for the Middle Way doctrine's meaning is
really not different from Mahamudra\] by many outstanding scholars of
these schools. Since it takes a great deal of careful thought and study
to understand Tsong Khapa's philosophy and how it differs from that of
the old schools, the translator believes that it is not wise to explain
the different views here briefly, for that would definitely lead to
misunderstanding. It is the wish of the translator to write an essay on
this topic at some later date.

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

[55](ettt12.htm#an_r_nar:55.md)<span id="an_n_nar:55"></span>. Here is
shown Tsong Khapa's "timidness" on Śūnyatā, and his materialistic view
is clearly reflected <span id="fr_22"></span>[\*](#fn_22.md).

[56](ettt13.htm#an_r_nar:56.md)<span id="an_n_nar:56"></span>. *Rtsa* in
Tibetan, *Nadi* in Sanskrit. All the tubular structures of the human
body, including the nerves, capable of transforming the fluids and
energies of the body. In the text this term is translated usually as
*nerve* or *nerves*. \[See also Part I, Ch. VII, Note 13. *Ed*.\]

[57](ettt13.htm#an_r_nar:57.md)<span id="an_n_nar:57"></span>. Literal
translation would be "enables me to become Buddha in eight lives in the
future."

[58](ettt13.htm#an_r_nar:58.md)<span id="an_n_nar:58"></span>. Naropa held
a professorship in an Indian college-monastery that had four doors. He
held the office of guardian of the North Door.

[59](ettt13.htm#an_r_nar:59.md)<span id="an_n_nar:59"></span>. Lacking
Marpa's original text, it is felt that the meaning of the Tibetan is
substantially conveyed by the three English terms given (barring any
esoteric meaning they might have carried and that is now lost).

[60](ettt13.htm#an_r_nar:60.md)<span id="an_n_nar:60"></span>. The Father
Tantra is one division of the highest, or Annutara Tantra, in which
emphasis is on the Skill \[*upāya* in the sense of perfect Love's
boundless means to aid. *Ed*.\] Teachings. The other division, called
the Mother Tantra by Tibetan scholars, is that which emphasizes the
Wisdom \[*prajñā*, in the sense of transcendental wisdom. *Ed*.\]
Teachings.

[61](ettt13.htm#an_r_nar:61.md)<span id="an_n_nar:61"></span>. "Light" is
the term used to symbolize the transparent nature of the pure
consciousness. This consciousness has, however, many degrees, hence many
terms are used to describe these gradations and manifestations of
consciousness, such as the Original or Mother Light, the Light-of-Sleep,
Light-of-Death, and Light-of-Bardo.

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

[62](ettt13.htm#an_r_nar:62.md)<span id="an_n_nar:62"></span>. Roma and
Rg’yng-ma: the Right and Left Channels.

[62a](ettt13.htm#an_r_nar:62a.md)<span id="an_n_nar:62a"></span>.
*gTum-ma:* Tibetan name for the Heat-Yoga. *Ed*.

[63](ettt13.htm#an_r_nar:63.md)<span id="an_n_nar:63"></span>. Tantrism
provides two types of teachings. The Skill Teachings instruct in those
methods used to carry the yogi beyond the habitual patterns of human
thought so that he may grasp that real beyond thought, the Pure
Consciousness. The Wisdom Teachings begin with the mind to penetrate
beyond it to the Realm of Pure Consciousness. \[Such skill is
technically called *thabs*. *Ed*.\]

[64](ettt13.htm#an_r_nar:64.md)<span id="an_n_nar:64"></span>. Here, Tsong
*Khapa* wishes to emphasize the differences between the blisses produced
by the experiences of ordinary meditation and those produced by Tantric
meditation.

[65](ettt13.htm#an_r_nar:65.md)<span id="an_n_nar:65"></span>. *Brave Ones*
(*Dpao Wo* in Tibetan): The male heavenly beings who practice
Tantricism.

[66](ettt13.htm#an_r_nar:66.md)<span id="an_n_nar:66"></span>. In tantric
meditation, the yogi visualizes himself as becoming the Patron Buddha or
yidam; he is no longer of human form.

[67](ettt13.htm#an_r_nar:67.md)<span id="an_n_nar:67"></span>. The special
belt wrapped around the body to keep it in the right posture for
meditation.

[68](ettt13.htm#an_r_nar:68.md)<span id="an_n_nar:68"></span>. This is
Tsong [Khapa's](errata.htm#71.md) own view which is refuted by Gamaba VIII
of the White School.

[69](ettt13.htm#an_r_nar:69.md)<span id="an_n_nar:69"></span>. *Two
pranas:* the up-going air and the down-going air; one negative and the
other positive.

[70](ettt13.htm#an_r_nar:70.md)<span id="an_n_nar:70"></span>. There are a
great number of pranas in the body of many different natures and
functions. In the past, thousands of different pranas were named and
classified. Today there still exists well-defined knowledge of fifty or
sixty pranas, but most of the traditional prana-knowledge has been lost.

[71](ettt13.htm#an_r_nar:71.md)<span id="an_n_nar:71"></span>. *Two lower
gates:* the anus and urethra.

[71a](ettt13.htm#an_r_nar:71a.md)<span id="an_n_nar:71a"></span>. *Tur Sel
Prana:* The down-going Prana.

[72](ettt14.htm#an_r_nar:72.md)<span id="an_n_nar:72"></span>. *Great
Symbol Thig-le:* A commentary on a Tantric book.

[73](ettt14.htm#an_r_nar:73.md)<span id="an_n_nar:73"></span> There are
various degrees of the Melting Bliss. Here, "disqualified" refers to a
lower, more mundane, bliss, rather than the highest actual Melting
Bliss.

[74](ettt15.htm#an_r_nar:74.md)<span id="an_n_nar:74"></span>
*Peaceful-Mind:* This refers to a special system of Tantric
[teaching](errata.htm#72.md) given by the *Gsan Adus Tantra*.
"Peaceful-Mind" is an expedient translation of a Tibetan term (Sems
Dben) which can be translated variously.

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

[75](ettt15.htm#an_r_nar:75.md)<span id="an_n_nar:75"></span>. There are
various levels of delusory thoughts to which sentient beings are
subject. The crude delusory thoughts such as resentment, anger, and
pleasure are easily recognized and felt by all conscious beings as well
as by those seeking [enlightenment](errata.htm#73.md). However, Buddhism
says that freedom from these gross illusory thoughts does not result in
enlightenment, since there are deeper, more subtle illusory thoughts in
sentient beings of which they are ordinarily unaware but which are the
source of bondage. These must be struggled with and eliminated before
enlightenment is obtained.

[76](ettt15.htm#an_r_nar:76.md)<span id="an_n_nar:76"></span>.
*Two-in-One-with-Learning* refers to all these teachings provided for
the instruction and enlightenment of those who have progressed up to the
stage just before Buddhahood. *Two-in-One-without-Learning* refers to
the stage of final enlightenment, Buddhahood, in which nothing remains
to be learned.

[77](ettt15.htm#an_r_nar:77.md)<span id="an_n_nar:77"></span>. The Tibetan
words *Snod* and *Bjud* \[pronounced "nu" and "ju". *Ed*.\] mean not
only the "Sentient beings" and the "Universe" but also "the supporter"
and "that which is supported"—implying the idea of the subjective and
the objective.

[78](ettt15.htm#an_r_nar:78.md)<span id="an_n_nar:78"></span>. *Two
Mandalas:* Here, [Tsong Khapa](errata.htm#74.md) does not clearly state
which Mandalas he refers to. Perhaps he means the Samaya Mandala and
Wisdom Mandala. See footnote 6 of Chapter IV (Initiation of Hayagriva)
on the "Samaya and Wisdom Buddhas."

[79](ettt15.htm#an_r_nar:79.md)<span id="an_n_nar:79"></span>. The original
text uses the term Dharma, which has the several meanings of existence,
objects, beings, becomings, Perceptions, etc.

[80](ettt15.htm#an_r_nar:80.md)<span id="an_n_nar:80"></span>. and
[81](ettt15.htm#an_r_nar:81.md)<span id="an_n_nar:81"></span>. These
statements reflect the typical thought of [Tsong](errata.htm#75.md) Khapa's
own philosophy, according to which there is a Voidness to be realized
and a (Reality) Voidness to be observed and contemplated, even from the
viewpoint of the Absolute Realm (the final transcendental truth). The
Old Schools declare that while in the Mundane Category it is permissible
to say that there is a giver and a receiver, a Voidness to meditate
upon, and one who meditates, etc.,

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

from the viewpoint of the Absolute Realm there is no Voidness to be
realized, nor anyone to realize this Voidness. As stated in the Diamond
Sutra by Gotama Buddha, himself:

"If anyone says, 'I see Buddha',  
 If anyone says, 'I hear the preaching of Buddha',  
 He treads a vicious path and will never behold Buddha."

Also in the same Sutra:

"Because there is no Wisdom to be attained, \[i.e., because the Buddha
knew this *Ed*.\]  
 Buddha said, 'I attained Wisdom'."

[82](ettt15.htm#an_r_nar:82.md)<span id="an_n_nar:82"></span>. This
statement reflects Tsong Khapa's philosophy of Voidness to the effect
that, briefly, "all conceptions are Void (Empty)" but that beings,
themselves, exist.

[83](ettt15.htm#an_r_nar:83.md)<span id="an_n_nar:83"></span>.
Main-meditation Stage: The period in meditation when the yogi is
concerned only with the central object of his meditation-practice in
contrast to the After-meditation Stage when he is engaged in daily
activities while, nevertheless, keeping his meditation experience in
mind.

[84](ettt15.htm#an_r_nar:84.md)<span id="an_n_nar:84"></span>. The meaning
of this sentence is not entirely clear. The translator presumes that a
solitary, isolated place is recommended as being most conducive to the
success of this yogic practice.

[85](ettt15.htm#an_r_nar:85.md)<span id="an_n_nar:85"></span>. Tantra: This
term may refer to a Tantra, a commentary on a Tantra, or to some other
book.

[86](ettt15.htm#an_r_nar:86.md)<span id="an_n_nar:86"></span>.
Perception-of-Mind: (Tib. Snang-wa). Tibetan terms have many meanings;
this the reader should keep in mind. In this case, not only
'perceptions' are meant but any subjects, objects, or visions created or
apprehended by the mind.

[87](ettt15.htm#an_r_nar:87.md)<span id="an_n_nar:87"></span>. The
absorbing process: The sinking of the different consciousnesses into one
fundamental consciousness during the process of death, enlightenment,
the Main-Meditation Stage, etc.

[88](ettt16.htm#an_r_nar:88.md)<span id="an_n_nar:88"></span>. Bardo: The
intermediate stage between life and death.

[89](ettt16.htm#an_r_nar:89.md)<span id="an_n_nar:89"></span>. *Beings of
Non-Intermission:* This refers to the most virtuous beings and the most
sinful beings. Both classes, because of their very strong Karma, are
said to have no Bardo experience but, instead, reincarnate immediately.

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

[90](ettt16.htm#an_r_nar:90.md)<span id="an_n_nar:90"></span>. Since Tsong
[Khapa's](errata.htm#76.md) commentary was designed for Tibetan scholars,
the quotations are often incomplete, for it was presumed that the
readers were familiar with the various Tantric texts, or had access to
the texts. At the time of this translation, these texts were not
available to the translator; therefore, it has proved most difficult to
translate and comment upon these scattered, fragmentary stanzas.

[91](ettt16.htm#an_r_nar:91.md)<span id="an_n_nar:91"></span>,
[92](ettt16.htm#an_r_nar:92.md)<span id="an_n_nar:92"></span>. These
statements reflect the typical polemic and pedantic characteristics of
Tsong [Khapa](errata.htm#77.md) and many other Tibetan scholars who have
been busily engaging in controversial argumentations on trifles and
matters of secondary importance in the past few centuries. Except for
Mahgi (the great woman philosopher of Tibet) and a handful of scholars,
few of them had a creative mind capable of producing a new philosophy
like the glorious teaching of Hwayan and Zen Buddhism of China. \[We do
not feel Tsong Khapa's explanations here so useless as the translator
alleges and suspect that a bit of understandable partisanship of his own
has colored his views here. See too [p. 244](ettt17.htm#page_244.md)
note.—*Ed*.\]

[93](ettt16.htm#an_r_nar:93.md)<span id="an_n_nar:93"></span>. *"Lazy man's
teaching":* In comparison with other teachings, the Bardo Yoga is much
easier and faster for attaining Buddhahood; hence the nickname.

[94](ettt16.htm#an_r_nar:94.md)<span id="an_n_nar:94"></span>. *The four
births of Saṃsara:* (1) the metamorphosis-born; (2) the egg-born; (3)
the womb-born; (4) the wet-born.

[95](ettt17.htm#an_r_nar:95.md)<span id="an_n_nar:95"></span>. *Realistic
and nihilistic extremes* (or the Realistic and Nihilistic Views):
According to Buddhism most of the philosophies and religious beliefs in
the world are either "realistic" or "nihilistic." Realistic Views are
those philosophies and beliefs that assert the absolute existence of
beings, god, retribution, etc. Nihilistic Views are those philosophies
that do not accept the existence of soul, reason, causation, and the
like. Both of these extremes are erroneous, says Buddhism; as a matter
of fact, these two *clingings* are basic causes of Saṃsara. The right
view is the view that transcends both extremes; namely, the Middle Way
Doctrine.

[96](ettt17.htm#an_r_nar:96.md)<span id="an_n_nar:96"></span>.
*Unparalleled Vehicle:* The Highest Division of Tantra, Anuttara Tantra.
\[This appellation is a term used by the Madhyamika apologists
themselves. Many would disagree. See the

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

discourse on the *Gotra* concept in the Introduction as well as the
previous footnote in the text.\] *Ed*.

[97](ettt17.htm#an_r_nar:97.md)<span id="an_n_nar:97"></span>. A little bit
presumptuous in the translator's opinion.

[98](ettt17.htm#an_r_nar:98.md)<span id="an_n_nar:98"></span>. This
paragraph is very confusing. Either Tsong Khapa himself made the mistake
by quoting this sentence that does not appear in the preceding
paragraph, or the negligence of the Tibetan book printer caused the
mistake. \[The sentence *is* mentioned and here we have straightforward
commentary. See our footnote on page [247](ettt17.htm#page_247.md).\] *Ed*.

[99](ettt17.htm#an_r_nar:99.md)<span id="an_n_nar:99"></span>. Here is
another incongruous statement about the quotation. The sentence that
appeared in the foregoing paragraph was "Ya!n grol ba na rlu!n gis ra!n
bzin rnyeg de." But here Tsong [Khapa](errata.htm#78.md) quotes it as "Ya!n
grol ba rlu!n gis ra!n bzin gyos te." The meaning and implications of
these two sentences are completely different. Since the original text of
the quoted matter is not available at present, the translator has no
sure way to correct this mistake. \[See editor's note to note 88 and
text. We disagree with the translator that there is any essential
difficulty here, the reference to the quotation existing and being
uniquely determinable.\]

[100](ettt18.htm#an_r_nar:100.md)<span id="an_n_nar:100"></span>. *Five
Paramount Crimes:* (1) matricide; (2) patricide; (3) killing an Arhat
(Buddhist saint); (4) causing disunion or division among the priesthood;
(5) malignantly causing Buddha to bleed.

[101](ettt18.htm#an_r_nar:101.md)<span id="an_n_nar:101"></span>. *Nine
gates of the body:* two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, rectum, urethra,
top of head.

[102](ettt18.htm#an_r_nar:102.md)<span id="an_n_nar:102"></span>. *Gate of
Purity:* another name for the Golden Gate or the gate of the head.

[103](ettt18.htm#an_r_nar:103.md)<span id="an_n_nar:103"></span>. According
to Tibetan lamas, the essential teachings of the Yoga of Entering
Another's Body was lost in Tibet. It was lost after the death of
Dharmadorje, son of Marpa.

See the biography of Marpa. \[See Tsong Khapa's own statement in the
last paragraph of Chapter 9.\]

[104](ettt18.htm#an_r_nar:104.md)<span id="an_n_nar:104"></span>.
*Confinement of Contemplation:* Any Buddhist who wants to practice
meditation in a serious manner must retreat to solitude or strictly
confine himself in hermitage for his devotion; he makes a vow not to go
beyond the boundary

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

of his room, hermitage, or the like for a certain period of time in
confinement to practice meditation.

[105](ettt18.htm#an_r_nar:105.md)<span id="an_n_nar:105"></span>. The
translator feels that it is necessary to add this sentence to make the
text understandable.

[106](ettt20.htm#an_r_nar:106.md)<span id="an_n_nar:106"></span>. This
sentence is not clear, nor did the writer clearly state which book he
referred to. \[*The Book of the Collected Pith-Instructions* appears to
be meant. See in the text five paragraphs above, [p.
263](ettt19.htm#page_263.md). Ed.\]

[107](ettt20.htm#an_r_nar:107.md)<span id="an_n_nar:107"></span>. Here
Tsong Khapa discredits the authenticity of the scriptures of the
Nyingmapa. In the translator's opinion Tsong Khapa fails to remember
that the entire Mahayana Buddhism, both Paramitayana and Vajrayana—the
teaching that he himself follows—was based on the very Sutras and
Tantras that have an accountable historical origin, so to speak; for
most of the Sutras and Tantras of Mahayana were "brought out" through
divine revelations. This is exactly the Nyingmapa way—receiving the
teaching from the Heavenly Treasures. According to the Nyingmapa Lamas,
the teachings from the visible human lineage are by no means better or
more reliable than the teachings received from revelation. As a matter
of fact, the latter are much superior, for they are closer, clearer,
"warmer," and more direct. Besides, there are less human prejudice and
dogmatic hocus-pocus involved.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_21"></span>[274:\*](ettt22.htm#fr_21.md) \[The translator
here, we feel, is imposing a very restricted interpretation on the text,
which may apply just as well to <span id="page_275">p. 275</span> a
female yogi, who also has Bodhi Heart. This term actually refers to the
inner love-power which is released or "melted" by "the taming of prana."
It is by no means simply to be conceived in any naive physical sense,
which would succeed only in mis-defining it as a false limitation. The
same is to be said of *Pad*.—*Ed*.\]

<span id="fn_22"></span>[276:\*](ettt22.htm#fr_22.md) We cannot agree with
the translator here. Tsong Khapa at this point is simply referring to
the error of the Nihilistic Extreme (see note 95). The *Anuttara Tantra*
(which Tsong Khapa follows, thus being on no account a materialist, as
the very next paragraph in the text also confirms) very explicitly
states that to reduce all things to non-existence is as wrong as to
affirm naively the ultimate reality of their phenomenal existence. The
Sūnyatā is not in question at all here.—*Ed*.
