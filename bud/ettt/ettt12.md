### CHAPTER THREE

### THE ARISING AND PERFECTING YOGA

In the second part, the actual practice of the Path, there are two
divisions—the *Arising Yoga* and the *Perfecting Yoga*.

We have heard some ignorant sayings from schools in Tibet that the
Arising Yoga is necessary only for the Mundane Accomplishments.
Nevertheless, according to the Mes-mds’ur and
Rngog[37](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:37.md)<span id="an_r_nar:37"></span> schools
of the Marpa lineage, the teaching of the Arising Yoga is given first.
Milarepa said:

"In the course of the arising and extinction of manifestation,  
 For the sake of developing the illuminated mind,  
 One should diligently practice both the Arising and the Perfecting
Yoga."

Many great teachers of the past said that to practice both the Arising
Yoga and Perfecting Yoga is necessary. Therefore, to dispense with the
Arising Yoga is against the teaching of Tantra and its authoritative
commentaries. It is also against the teaching of their own \[i.e. the
ignorant objectors’\] schools; hence, before the practice of Perfecting
Yoga, we must study and practice the Arising Yoga. As said in the
*Tantra of G’ye-rdo-rje:*

"If one says the two Yogas are equal[38](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:38.md)<span
id="an_r_nar:38"></span>,  
 It is a Tantra-infant's preaching."

 The same Tantra also says:

"Through practising the Arising Yoga,  
 The Tantric Yogi[39](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:39.md)<span
id="an_r_nar:39"></span> first practices the Yoga of
Forms[40](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:40.md)<span id="an_r_nar:40"></span>  
 Knowing the Yoga of Forms is dreamlike <span id="page_147">p.
147</span>  
 The Yoga of Form itself eventually becomes the Yoga of Non-Form."

The Holy Nagarjuna says:

"First one should master the Arising Yoga,  
 Then one should aspire to the Perfecting Yoga,  
 This is the teaching given by the Perfect Buddha,  
 It is like a ladder with rungs."

Thus in many sutras we find stated the necessity for practising the
Arising Yoga first. The main reason for this necessity is that the
Arising Yoga will lay a good foundation for the Perfecting Yoga, and
will ripen and produce in the Yogi's heart the complete enlightenment
experience of the Perfecting Yoga.

 

If the disciple has attained a stable Samadhi of Arising Yoga, he can
then begin practicing the Perfecting Yoga. In the course of this
practice, he first meditates solely on either the Father or the Mother
tutelary deity for the sake of convenience and ease. In such case he may
not be wrong. However, to think that this process can also be adopted by
the beginner is certainly against the principle of Tantra. Then, how
should one practice? According to those who retain the traditions and
principles of this teaching, the foundation of the teaching of the Six
Yogas is the Heat Yoga. This view is based mainly on the doctrine of
Hevajra, in which it is stated that any one of the four
castes[41](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:41.md)<span id="an_r_nar:41"></span> can be
led to practice this teaching.

Those revered masters in the past who devoted themselves mainly to
practicing this teaching acquired their Pith instructions from the
Tantra of Bde-mchog. From

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Gambopa, through
the transmission of Ladak and Mar, the Bde-mchog teaching of Ladak was
transmitted. In his youth, the Glorious Pag-mo-grub-pa practiced the
Bde-mchog teaching from Mar-do. Transmissions were derived from the
Bde-mchog Mandala of Sixty-two Tutelaries of the Lu-I-Pa School.
Although there are two such different transmissions, they both (provide
the methods of) producing bliss and joy; therefore the practice of
either one will do. One should thus practice the Yoga of Four
Periods[42](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:42.md)<span id="an_r_nar:42"></span> which
will lead to the unfoldment of the Mandalas from the feet—the Five
Buddhas and Bells—to the head.

Now, these experiences will be [encountered](errata.htm#24.md) during the
practice of Arising Yoga as the appropriate instructions are followed:

At first, (the yogi) should visualize the tutelary deity through the
gradual steps till the whole body of the tutelary is completed. If the
tutelary deity visualized has many faces and arms, the yogi may
disregard the others and concentrate on visualizing the two main arms
and the main face. There are two ways of visualizing the tutelary one's
body: the upward process from the feet to the head, and the downward
process from the head to the feet.

The tutelary-body should be envisioned as a whole, clearly and vividly.
At first, however, the yogi should visualize the body not in specific
detail but the body at once complete; then softly and loosely hold onto
the visualization without any distraction. If any disturbing or
diversified thought arises liable to cause the meditator to follow it,
the meditator should beware, and bring his mind back to the object of
meditation. If the visualization (mind-picture) becomes unclear, the
yogi should freshen it by seeing it vividly until it becomes clear
again. In the process

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

of his meditation, the yogi will have the following experiences; that
part of the tutelary-body he intensifies will appear clearly and
vividly, the part to which he pays no attention will never appear in his
mind-picture. Finally, the mind-picture will become so clear that he
will think that not even the actual eye could see it better.

If the yogi wants to rest his mind stably on the clear picture, he must
overcome drowsiness and distraction. Throughout the whole period of
meditation he must possess the power of concentration.

Having mastered the above-mentioned "sketchy
visualization"[43](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:43.md)<span
id="an_r_nar:43"></span>, the yogi should then visualize the other
faces, arms, adornments etc., until all the details are complete and
perfect. Thereafter the Mother tutelary deity should be visualized, then
the other deities. Eventually the yogi is able to picture clearly and
vividly all the deities (in the Mandala) and the objects in the complete
Beyond-Measure Palace, general and specific, all at once in perfect
concentration. The yogi is required to reach this stage.

Now the teaching of the Tutelary Pride[44](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:44.md)<span
id="an_r_nar:44"></span>:

The yogi should raise the Tutelary Pride and think to himself, "I am the
Buddha so-and-so," and concentrate on this. If the vision becomes
unclear, the yogi should freshen it again. In the beginning, this
meditation-with-effort-and-stress is needed. Later on, the yogi will be
able to maintain a stable feeling of the Tutelary Pride after the
meditation period in his daily activities. When he reaches this stage,
his mental power of retaining the visualization will be strong enough to
withstand the fluctuating circumstances, and he will maintain the
Tutelary Pride in between meditation periods. The Visualization Practice
and Tutelary Pride Practice should be exercised alternately. Working

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

on this superb meditation, consisting of both deities and their
dwellings, will eventually prevent the arising of the Samsaric visions;
only the Superb Visions[45](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:45.md)<span
id="an_r_nar:45"></span> will appear in the yogi's mind. The spontaneous
Tutelary Pride—capable of [maintaining](errata.htm#25.md) itself in all
fluctuating circumstances—is the cure which purifies the vulgar (or
Saṃsaric) attachments in the yogi's mind.

When the yogi arises from his meditation, whatever he sees—living beings
or the material world—he should think of as Buddhas and Buddhas'
dwelling-places. If he can stabilize this feeling, he can attain the
steadfast Samadhi. When he reaches this stage, he is admitted to have
purified the Common Visions through the practice of the Arising Yoga.

It is said in the *Tantra of Sdom-*a*byung:*

"The nature of the Three Kingdoms is the Beyond-Measure Palace. All the
living beings are the deities of the Mandala."

The saintly Apags-b’a-Iha said, "If you understand that the myriad
manifestations are the Mandala itself, how would it be
[possible](errata.htm#26.md) for your mind to become confused?" This
understanding is applicable to both the Arising and the Perfecting Yoga.
According to the principle of Vajrayana, all
[manisfestations](errata.htm#27.md) are the Mandala of Heaven; all feelings
and experiences are the Great Bliss; all thoughts are the Untreated. To
follow and to identify this principle is the main function of the
Arising Yogi. In the Arising Yoga, the Great Bliss of Perfecting
Yoga—produced by the entering of Life Prana into the Central Channel—is
not found. Nevertheless, since the practicer has attained a very stable
and clear visualization of Yab-Yum Buddha, he is able to unify wisdom
and skill, to stop wavering and fluctuating

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bodhi-heart, as
symbolized in the *Pad* word[46](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:46.md)<span
id="an_r_nar:46"></span>; and he will [experience](errata.htm#28.md) a
variety of blisses in Arising Yoga.

In short, the main objective and function of the Arising Yoga—the
practice of visualizing the Mandala—is to ripen the yogi, to bring his
consciousness forth to the realization of the identity of Buddha and
sentient beings.

 

The instruction of the Practice of Perfecting Yoga is given in three
parts: the basic principles, the step-by-step path, and the realization
of the fruit or accomplishment.

In the first part there are two divisions:

1\. The basic principle or real-nature of the mind.

2\. The basic principle or real-nature of the body.

For the sake of exposing the principles behind the complete practices,
the first exposition is introduced. For the sake of explaining the
points in the body with respect to which the visualization should be
carried out, the second exposition is introduced.

1\. The basic principle of the mind.

The *Tantra of Two Forms* says:

"The mind, the perceiver, is formless in its essence.  
 There is no sound and no hearer, no smell and no smeller,  
 no taste and no taster, no touch and no feeler.  
 Likewise there are no mind and
mind-functions[47](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:47.md)<span
id="an_r_nar:47"></span>."

"One should understand that the organs, the outer-objects,  
 and the consciousnesses of the organs  
 Are all the Goddesses.  
 Thus, the eighteen dhatus[48](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:48.md)<span
id="an_r_nar:48"></span> are preached.  
 From the very beginning, their essence is uncreated—never did they come
into being. <span id="page_152">p. 152</span>  
 They are neither false nor real;  
 Therefore, they are like the moon's reflection in the water.  
 Thus should you understand the Dakinis."

The \[visual\] form, sound, smell, taste, and \[touch\] stimuli are the
five outer objects, from the seer to the feeler are the five senses,
from the eye to the body are the five organs. In the terms of
[Skandhas](errata.htm#29.md), they all belong to the Aggregation of Form.
In the terms of Ayatana[49](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:49.md)<span
id="an_r_nar:49"></span> they belong to the ten Ayatanas of form; the
Nonself-nature of them is thus pointed out by the stanza. The so-called
mind (Sems) is the Aggregation of Consciousness, or the Ayatana of
Consciousness. The so-called mind-function is the Aggregation of
Feelings, Perceptions, and Emotions. The above stanza explains the
Non-self-nature of sense-data or the Ayatana of Dharma. The form-seer
and the sound-hearer mentioned in the stanza denote the egotistic
conception of beings. In short, this stanza illustrates both the
Clinging of Ego and the Clinging of Dharma.

The stanza says that the non-existence of essence means the absence or
the non-existence of self-nature in all Dharmas and living beings. These
sayings are the philosophy of the great master Mds’o-sg’yes as mentioned
in his commentary. They imply the Voidness or non-existence of the
self-nature or the non-existence of the definable nature of being—the
self-being as expressed in many other sources.

This truth of the non-existence of self-nature, or the nonexistence of
essence, or the never-come-into-being-self-nature, is by no means
previously untrue but intentionally and subsequently verified through
human reason and the holy edifications. This truth exists from the very
beginning, as said in the stanza "to understand the truth as it is";

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

this clearly demonstrates the aspect of the "Originally true".

Guru Marpa said:

"On the bank of the Ganges river in the East,  
 Through the grace of the great Medrepa[50](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:50.md)<span
id="an_r_nar:50"></span>,  
 I fully realized the original reality of the never-come-into-being.  
 This enlightenment kindles the void-nature of mind.  
 Clearly I beheld the original essence—the truth devoid of play-words,  
 And clearly saw the Three Bodies,  
 Whereby all the conceptualistic ideas in my mind were forever cleared
up."

Thus Marpa's understanding of Mahamudra was procured mainly from the
great master Medrepa, who, in this connection, particularly referred to
the *Thatness* among the *Ten Solenesses*. As he said in a stanza: "It
is neither with form nor without form." By this he meant the *Soleness
of the Originally True*, not the *Soleness With Form* nor the *Soleness
Without Form*. His disciple Lhan-j’ig-sg’yes-pai-rdor-rjes gave the
exposition to this stanza in his commentary:

"Without-Form means the doctrine of the Sutra School. These terms also
imply the True Form or Illusory Form of Yogachara, as favored by the
School of Yogachara of True Form and the School of Yogachara of Illusory
Form. This is also applicable to the Madhyamika Yogachara School—its
doctrine allows the mind-only philosophy, either With Form or Without
Form, of Yogachara in the field of mundane
truth[51](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:51.md)<span id="an_r_nar:51"></span>.

The doctrine of Two Truths should be established in a manner such as the
Great Yogi Milarepa explains:

(The printing is not clear in the two first lines.)

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

"Buddha says that all do exist.  
 But, in the category of Transcendental Truth,  
 There are no hindrances and even no Buddha.  
 There is no meditator nor meditation.  
 There is no practice nor experiences.  
 Neither is there any Buddha-body nor Buddha-wisdom—  
 Therefore there is no Nirvana.  
 All such terms are merely names and conceptions."

According to the Middle-Way doctrine of Nagrajuna, Aryadeva,
Zla-wa-grags-b’a, the very nature of causation itself is Soleness. So
this stanza implies that only these sages’ doctrine is
acceptable[52](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:52.md)<span id="an_r_nar:52"></span>.
Nagrajuna and Aryadeva, the Savior and the Holy One, were both
middle-wayists after the Sutra period. Subsequent to the period of these
two sages, there were many people who talked about Middle-Way
philosophy, but these people can only nominally be regarded as
middle-wayists. The superb being, Master Medrepa, and the meritorious
Dhawadrapa were two outstanding sages who really held Nagrajuna's and
Arydeva's view in a correct manner. Furthermore the *Treatise of the Ten
Solenesses* says: "Without the adornment of pith-instructions from one's
Guru, one can be considered only a mediocre follower of the middle way.

Zla-wa-zhaba said that, if a teacher has no pith-instruction as if an
adornment for himself, he can be only a mediocre follower of the middle
way. This right explanation of the ultimate truth by Zla-wa-zhaba should
be rightly followed.

Now, the explanations of "neither true nor false."

Says the *Sutra of the Sixty Rational Stanzas:*

"The beings that depend on and are caused by other beings, <span
id="page_155">p. 155</span>  
 Their nature is insubstantial like the moon's reflection in water.  
 All the stable and unstable living beings in Saṃsara  
 Are originally unborn and non-existent.  
 There is no fundamental truth nor Innate
Wisdom[53](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:53.md)<span id="an_r_nar:53"></span>,  
 There is neither Karma nor the effects of Karma.  
 Therefore, the Saṃsara never existed—even its name is meaningless!  
 O, the absolute truth is like this!"

Thus it is said that in the Transcendental Truth nothing whatsoever
exists, Saṃsaric or Nirvanic—not an iota ever existed. But immediately
the Sutra continues:

"Alas, if there is no sentient being,  
 From where have the Buddhas in the Three Times come?  
 If there are no causes there will be no effects.  
 In the sense of Mundane Truth  
 Both Saṃsara and Nirvana exist.  
 This is said by Buddha Shakyamuni himself.  
 The existence and the non-existence,  
 The entities and the emptiness,  
 The manifestations and the reality,  
 Are identical and of one taste.  
 In essence there is no difference between them at all.  
 There is no self-awareness nor other-awareness,  
 All and all are absorbed in the great two-in-one.  
 The sages who have realized this truth  
 See no consciousness but wisdom.  
 The sages who have realized this truth  
 See no sentient beings but Buddhas,  
 See no Dharma Form but Dharma Essence.  
 They are neither true nor false  
 One should not fall into these views."

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

Sentient beings and materials are all produced through respective causes
and conditions; they are consolidated through conceptualization;
therefore, they are not real, nor have they any substantiality. In other
words, all beings are void in their self-nature in the sense of the
actual existence of self-essence. If there were an independently-solid
self-nature in beings there would be no need for depending on any cause
or conditions (to form the beings themselves). Thus there never existed
even an atom of sense-data (outer-object) upon which the Clinging of
Existence arises[54](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:54.md)<span
id="an_r_nar:54"></span>.

This very truth does not impair the order and functions of the
causation-bound events in Saṃsara and Nirvana; as dream, magic, and
shadow, all the transpiring events manifest. Based on this view, one
should know that those who claim the Voidness as the non-existence of
the horn-of a-rabbit \[i.e. the non-existence of false notions Ed.\] are
mistaken. One should also know that those who claim nonexistence of the
delusory snake-perception arising from the rope, are also wrong. Thus,
one should know that this absolute non-existence of the sensedata upon
which the Clinging of Existence arises is the correct understanding of
Sunyata. Without such a horse-of-right-understanding, even if one rides
on a horse-of-Buddha, one will not be able to cross the stream of
Saṃsara.

Says the *Tantra of Rdo-rje-bgur:*

"In order to destroy the clinging of ego,  
 The Buddhas have preached the teaching of the Voidness."

This means that in order to destroy the Clinging of Ego and the Clinging
of Dharma, Buddhas have preached the philosophy of the Voidness. Though
the principle of the Transcendental Truth is as mentioned above, even in
the

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

category of Mundane Truth, if one decisively or unalterably identifies
existent things with dreams, magic, and illusory visions, one will
eventually come to the point of the
Nothingness[55](ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:55.md)<span id="an_r_nar:55"></span>
which is not allowed in my school. If one follows the wrong views of
other schools one is liable to fall into endless dangers.

Some hold that all manifestations are magic-like, and accept the
existence of all happenings in Saṃsara and Nirvana—such as the
attainment of Buddhahood. They also claim that all manifestations are
merely names and words denominated and conceptualized by human beings,
that the manifested beings in the causations are identical in essence
with the Voidness of non self-nature, that the existence and the
non-existence have never separated from each other. They further claim
that this is the special teaching given by the great masters in the
past, and that it is not necessary to follow the Two-Truths System of
the Middle Way doctrine. This kind of saying is not right; it is against
the teachings of the Buddhas and the exposition of them by sages. Not
only that, these sayings contradict their own doctrine, for on the one
hand they deny the Two-Fold Truth and on the other hand they accept the
principle of the identity of bliss and voidness. In short, one should
definitely search for the understanding of Voidness which is briefly
explained above.

 

2\. The basic principles or nature of the Body.

In the center of the Transformation-Wheel (Chakra) at the navel and the
other main Wheels in the body is pivoted the Central Channel; the upper
end and the lower end of

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

it, together with other points of the Wheels, are the most important
centers. These centers are viewed as vital points and are emphasized in
the Skill-in-Yoga-Teachings of Tantra.

According to the pith-instructions of Marpa, one should put emphasis on
the Heart and Throat Centers during sleeping, and should know the
critical teachings on the Navel and Forehead Centers during the practice
of Heat Yoga and Karma Yoga in the awakening stage. This is because
during these different times the Thig-le <span
id="fr_8"></span>[\*](#fn_8.md) upon which the consciousness relies
concentrates at these four different centers. According to the teaching
of Dus-*a*kor (Kalachakra) the Head Center and Navel Center produce the
Thig-le in the awakening stage; the Throat and the Secret Center produce
the Thig-le in dreaming stage; the Heart and the Precious Center produce
the Thig-le in the deep-dreaming stage. This agrees approximately with
the saying that at the end of the navel and genital center, the Thig-le
is produced in the four different times.

At the time of falling into sleep, the pranas will gather at the Heart
Center and the Precious Center. When they are heavily concentrated, one
will fall into sleep; thereafter, the pranas in these two parts
gradually become thinner and thinner. When (most of) the pranas come to
the Secret Center and Throat Center the fleeting dreams will appear;
when the pranas have gathered in these two parts for some time the
actual dreams (or steady dreams) will arise. When the pranas rise up to
the Center Head and Navel Centers, one will awake. From the Head Center
the Thig-le drops to the end of the precious organ; as it reaches the
different

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

centers as mentioned above it will produce the various blisses (or
so-called Four Blisses).

This is the meaning of the four times:

Through the power of the prana the Yogi manipulates in exercise, the
Downward-Bliss produces the Dim Innate when it reaches the center of the
navel; when it reaches the end of the precious organ the Bright Innate
is produced.

That these four centers are very important in the meritorious exercises
of dream and sleep by no means implies that they are not essential
points upon which the exercises of mental concentration should be
carried out during the daytime. Among all the centers in the body, the
Navel Center is the one upon which the Yogi should begin. One should
also know that to concentrate upon the different centers will produce
different effects and specific advantages.
