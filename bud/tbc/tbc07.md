### PREFACE

to the

## Forty-Second Edition.

The writer of this catechism has passed away from earth, but, before he
left the body, he had arranged with the High Priest Sumangala to make
some small corrections in the text. These are incorporated in the
present edition by the High Priest's wish, expressed to me in Colombo in
November 1907.

I have not altered the numbering of the questions, as it might cause
confusion in a class to change the numbers if some pupils had the older
editions and some the new.
