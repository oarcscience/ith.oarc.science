### PREFACE

to the

## Fortieth Edition.

The popularity of this little work is proved by the constant demand for
new editions, in English and other languages. In looking over the matter
for the present edition, I have found very little to change or to add,
for the work seems to present a very fair idea of the contents of
Southern Buddhism; and, as my object is never to write an extended essay
on the subject, I resist the temptation to wander off into
amplifications of details which, however interesting to the student of
comparative religion, are useless in a rational scheme of elementary
instruction.

The new Sinhalese version (38th edition) which is being prepared by my
respected friend, D. B. Jayatilake, Principal of Ânanda (Buddhist)
College, Colombo, is partly printed, but cannot be completed until he is
relieved of some of the pressure upon his time. The Tamil version (41st
edition) has been undertaken by the leaders of the Pañchama community of
Madras, and will shortly issue from the press. The Spanish

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

version (39th edition) is in the hands of my friend Senor Xifre´, and
the French one (37th edition) in those of Commandant Courmes.

So the work goes on, and by this unpretending agency the teachings of
the Buddha Dharma are being carried throughout the world.
