### THE DOCTRINE OF KARMAN AND TRANSMIGRATION, COSMOGONY, THEOGONY

I. Mechanism of transmigration. II. Classification of actions and
mechanism of their fructification. III. Destiny, free-will, solidarity.
IV. Cosmogony. V. Theogony.

#### I

The Buddhists did not discover the notion of Karman, but they were
amongst the first to emphasize its importance, and probably the first to
understand clearly its nature. It remains to be seen how the doctrine of
Karman provides them with a rationalistic theory of the soul as a
transmigrating non-entity, with a theory of cosmogony, or creation of
the world, and of theogony, or origin of the gods.

Man, according to the Buddhists, is not a metaphysical entity, an
individual, a thing in itself (*chose en sot*), a self. Were he a Self,
he could not be modified; he could not be extinguished; he would endure
as he is and as he

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

was, for eternity; he would be lifeless and unconscious, since life and
consciousness are succession and change. Man is a complex and
impermanence itself.

But, on the other hand, Man is not lacking in unity and continuity; he
is a living complex, not a haphazard succession of unconnected
phenomena; he is a chain of causes and effects.

The diverse elements of this chain are to be classified under three
headings: (1) passions or desires, (2) actions and (3) what is called
fruit (*phala*), that is sensations together with the immediate
conditions of sensation.

To be less technical. There arises a desire which may or may not be
followed by an action (act of volition and physical action). If there is
action, this action is to be rewarded; in Buddhist language, it ripens,
it produces fruit: the fruit is pleasant or unpleasant sensation,
together with the whole physical and psychical organism without which
sensation is impossible. Sensation, in its turn, produces desire—love or
hatred—which again produces action. The wheel continues to roll on this
'threefold rim': desire, action, ripening of action.

Such is the general principle.

Much space would be required to develop all

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

the consequences of this principle; but what follows is the essential.

If we consider the changes a being undergoes during the long journey
through transmigration—more exactly the changes which modify the complex
we call a being—it is evident that these changes are of a manifold
nature. On the one hand, they are either physico-psychical or moral. On
the other hand, they are either small or great, either of the nature of
an evolution or of the nature of a revolution.

There is an incessant change both physico-psychical and moral.

In the course of one existence, that is, between what is called
conception or birth and what is called death, physico-psychical changes
are, as a rule, small. When a being is born as a man, an animal, a god,
it lives and dies as a man, an animal, a god. There are exceptions. It
is, for instance, recorded that a certain monk for having abused the
congregation and having styled his colleagues "Women!" suddenly became a
woman. It happens that the murderer of a saint is thrown down alive into
hell, and, without dying as a man, is wrapped in a body of hell. Such
events are rare. The physico-psychical changes that take place during a
life do not, as

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

a rule, affect the general frame of the body or the mind.

Moral changes may, on the contrary, be enormous, as is the case when a
man becomes a saint or a murderer, when a man 'plants a strong root of
merit' or when he commits a hellish sin. Let us observe in passing that
man and woman alone are usually regarded as being capable of sin or good
deeds. The other states of existence, hells and paradises, are almost
exclusively states of enjoyment, of reward or punishment.

But then comes death. Death occurs when the mass of actions that were to
receive retribution in some existence is exhausted. A life as a rule—for
there are exceptions—is measured out with a measure, in length, in pains
and pleasures, to make up exactly the quantity and the quality of reward
for the enjoyment of which this life has been started. Death, we say, is
the moment for great physico-psychical changes which depend on moral
changes. At this moment, a sort of balance is made of the moral debit
and credit. The moral status is ascertained and the next existence is to
be in accordance with this status. A new physico-psychical complex
suited to this next existence is to be created, and, in order to create
it, the last state of consciousness,

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

that is, the dying consciousness, takes such and such a form. For
instance, if the new existence is to be hell, the dying man hears the
cries of the damned; he dies and, at the same moment, the dying
consciousness is continued into the first state of consciousness of a
new infernal being. This first state of consciousness of a new being is
what we call technically 'birth-consciousness' or
'conception-consciousness' (*pratisaṃdhivijñāna*).

 

Here we have to make a distinction.

Infernal beings and gods have no parents: their birth is 'apparitional,'
that is, is accounted for as a magical apparition. To put it otherwise,
the birth-consciousness of a new god or creature of hell is apt to make
for itself and by itself, out of unorganized matter, the body it is to
inhabit. Therefore the birth of such beings will follow immediately
after the death of the being which is to be reborn as infernal being or
god.

The case is different, as a rule, with animals, ghosts and men; with
such beings, birth or conception presupposes physical circumstances that
may not be realized at the moment of the death of the being to be
reincarnated. Physical

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

conditions of conception are wanting if a being is to be reborn as a dog
at a moment when the season of dogs is over. Physical conditions of
birth are wanting for such animals as maggots, which are born from
putrid meat, if there is no meat to be found in such a state. In these
cases, and in many similar cases, the dying consciousness cannot be
continued at once into the birth-consciousness of a new being.

Hence a difficulty which is clearly solved by the schools which maintain
the so-called 'intermediary existence' (*antarābhava*). According to
these schools, the dying consciousness is continued into a short-lived
being, named *Gandharva*, which lasts for seven days or for seven times
seven days—evidently a notion borrowed from the animistic theories of
old. This Gandharva, very like a disincarnated spirit, creates, with the
help of the conceptional elements, an animal embryo, a ghostly or human
embryo, as soon as it can find opportunity. It is driven by the wind of
acts towards the right matrix; but there are, sometimes, mistakes: for
instance it happens that the new animal is born as a jackal instead of a
dog.

 

The decisive element on which depends the

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

next existence is the dying consciousness. It is the dying consciousness
which originates the birth-consciousness, and which is the immediate
cause of the birth-consciousness.

That the moral dispositions at death are of great importance has been
admitted by many a religion, in India and outside India. And that these
dispositions depend on the life which is ending, that a man dies as he
has lived, this is also a common notion and not a bad piece of
psychology.

Ideas that have been cherished during life reappear at death; a man has,
in this crucial moment, a vivid memory of his sins and good deeds,—and,
in the latter case, of the reward for which he has been striving.

Śākyamuni says this in so many words: A man, who is endowed with merit,
has been thinking: "May I, when my body dissolves, obtain rebirth in a
powerful princely family!" He thinks this thought, dwells on this
thought, cherishes this thought, and this thought, which he has thus
cherished and fostered, will be his last thought. "This is, O monks, the
avenue and path which leads to rebirth in a powerful princely family."

The last thought is often a summary and the

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

result of the moral and intellectual life of a dying man. But such is
not always the case.

The last thought is to bring about the next existence; it is therefore
predetermined by the action which is to be rewarded in this next
existence—and this action may be a very ancient action, performed many
centuries ago. This will be made evident by an example.

When an animal is to be reborn as a man, it will have a dying
consciousness to this effect. This dying consciousness does not depend
on any action or thought of the animal, for animals are dull and
incapable of morality; this dying consciousness depends on some ancient
good deed which was to ripen into a human birth and which, for a long
time, has been prevented from producing its result: there was a mass of
bad actions first requiring retribution. Now that this mass of bad
actions has borne its fruit—let us say a score of infernal or animal
rebirths—the turn of the good action comes at last, and the last animal
in the score of animal rebirths cherishes in its last moment the ideas,
desires or images, which will cause a human rebirth.

The Buddhists say that if the seed of a plant has been dyed a certain
colour, this colour will reappear in the flower although it does not

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

exist in any of the stages of development of the plant, in the stem and
so on. A western comparison is better and really to the point: heredity.
A man may be like his grandfather, not like his father. The germs of a
disease have been introduced into the organism of an ancestor; for some
generations they remain dormant; they suddenly manifest themselves in
actual disease. So intricate is the living complex; so mysterious the
laws of heredity, we should say; so mysterious the reward of actions,
say the Buddhists.

We believe that this comparison is to the point. For every moment in the
life of these physico-psychical complexes which are called living
beings, is the heir of the preceding one, and carries all the
potentialities of a very long past.

#### II

A few remarks are necessary on the time of the reward of actions.

There are actions which are styled *lokottara*, supermundane, actions
that are not born from desire. They bear no fruit, except the fruit of
deliverance (*visaṃyoga*); they destroy desire; they cancel the reward
of the other actions;

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

they lead to Nirvāṇa; they are part of, or rather they constitute the
path to Nirvāṇa. We shall study them presently <span
id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47.md). We are now concerned with the actions
which foster transmigration, that is produce rebirth or reward: because
they originate from desire.

Some are necessarily rewarded, some are not.

I. The first are to be classified in three groups: acts rewarded in the
present life; acts rewarded in the next existence; acts rewarded later.

1\. When compared with the reward in another life, the reward in this
life is looked upon as small. Pain in this life is nothing when compared
with pain in hell; human pleasures cannot vie with celestial pleasures.

An important point is that the retribution of a sin depends to a large
extent on the moral status of the sinner.

When a man is deficient in merit, a slight evil deed will ripen into an
infernal existence. A good man, on the contrary, will expiate the same
evil deed in this life: a slight punishment, although, says the text, it
may appear not slight but very painful.

It is as if a man were to put a lump of salt into a small cup of water:
the water would be made salt and undrinkable. But if the same lump of
salt were put into the river Ganges, the water of the Ganges would not
be perceptibly modified <span id="fr_48"></span>[2](#fn_48.md).

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

In the same way, the moral status of a good man is not modified by a
small sin; but this sin, if complete, is to be rewarded; it is therefore
rewarded here below.

2\. Some acts are necessarily rewarded in the next existence. Their
retribution cannot be delayed by the retribution of any other act; and
they are accordingly styled 'immediate,' *ānantarya*. Parricide, for
instance. Such sins prevent the acquisition of Sanctity.

3\. There is a third category of sins, which, heavy as they may be, are
not necessarily rewarded in the following existence. Their retribution
may be delayed to make room for the retribution of other acts; in that
case they are rewarded 'later on.' Or, and this point is interesting, as
they do not prevent the acquisition of Sanctity, it happens that they
are turned into actions to be rewarded here below.

The classical illustration of this rule is the case of Aṅgulimāla, "the
man with a garland of fingers," a celebrated robber and murderer.
Śākyamuni converted him, owing to some ancient root of merit he
possessed hidden under a heap of sins. Aṅgulimāla became a monk and a
Saint, that is a man who has obtained deliverance and will not be
reborn; but he did not avoid the fruit of his sinful actions: when he
goes into the town

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

to collect alms, as the monks do every day, the populace greets him with
stones; he is covered with blood; his begging bowl is broken and his
robe torn. In this state he comes to Śākyamuni who says to him: "The
reward of your evil deeds, you should have experienced for long years,
for many thousands of years in hell; and you are now experiencing it
already in this life <span id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md)."

II\. A few words will give an idea of the actions which are not
necessarily rewarded, which may be abandoned or 'left behind.' A Saint,
who has acquired much merit, is not obliged to enjoy this merit in
paradise: he will, at death, reach Nirvāṇa. Again, a man who is to be
reborn in one of the highest heavens and to obtain Nirvāṇa there—in
technical language an Anāgāmin—abandons all the actions, good or evil,
that were to be rewarded in hell, here below, or in the inferior
paradises. In the same way, say the texts, a man who changes his
residence for ever, leaves his debts behind him.

We are now able to understand the mechanism of the fructification of
actions <span id="fr_50"></span>[2](#fn_50.md).

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

Existences are good or bad: human and divine existences are good;
infernal existence, ghostly existence, animal existence are bad.

An existence, a rebirth, is caused, technically 'projected' (*ākṣipta*),
by a single act. All men are reborn as men owing to a good action: how
is it then that so many men are unhappy? Because a number of acts
combine to condition an existence; hence the variety of the living
beings belonging to the same kind.

A man, owing to wrong views or bad inherited dispositions commits one of
the ten sins: he commits murder, theft, adultery; he uses mendacious,
malignant, rude, foolish language; he nourishes covetous designs,
hateful sentiments, wrong views. These sins are supposed to be complete,
that is, fully premeditated, consciously done, cherished and approved:
they are to be necessarily rewarded in the following existence; and
accordingly the man is reborn in hell. When the sin is very heavy (owing
to repetition, etc.) this man dies in some hell only to be reborn in
another' hell; and that ten times, a hundred times, a thousand times.
His infernal existences and his sufferings are what is technically
called the 'fruit of ripening' (*vipākaphala*) of his sin.

The birth-projecting force of the sin is not

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

yet exhausted; but it is diminished. Therefore, we have now animal
rebirths, one, ten, or a hundred animal rebirths. The sufferings
undergone in these animal existences are again the 'fruit of ripening';
but the nature of the animal is a fruit called *niṣyandaphala*, 'a fruit
similar to the action.' For instance a murderer will be reborn as a
tiger; a thief as a cunning animal, a serpent, and so on.

The birth-projecting force of the sin is now exhausted; accordingly,
there is room for the projecting power of some ancient good act which
was 'to be rewarded later'; and now this act projects a human life: this
human life, together with the pleasures to be enjoyed in this life, is
the 'fruit of ripening' of the good act.

But these pleasures will be few and small. Such a human existence will
not be a happy one. The former inhabitant of hell, the former animal,
although reborn as a man, remains under the influence of his ancient
sin. He suffers pains akin to this sin. An ancient murderer will be
short-lived, he will be crushed to death; a thief will be poor; an
adulterer will have an unfaithful wife, and so on. These pains are a
part of the *niṣyandaphala* of the ancient sin. The second part consists
in mental or moral dispositions

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

in accordance with the dispositions which, long ago, culminated in an
actual sin. The murderer, after a long abode in hell (*vipākaphala*),
has been reborn as a tiger (*niṣyandaphala*) and, suffered as a tiger
(*vipākaphala*). Dying as a tiger, he is reborn as a man (*vipākaphala*
of a former good act), but as a man destined to violent death and of a
cruel nature (*niṣyandaphala* of the sin). And so on. In short, Karman
explains everything that concerns 'the world of living beings'
(*sattvaloka*), inhabitants of hell, animals, ghosts, men and gods; the
power of gods and kings, the physical beauty of women, the splendid tail
of peacocks, the moral dispositions of every one.

#### III

Ancient India, as does also to a large extent the India of to-day,
believed in destiny, a τυχή, the *daiva*, from *deva*, god (also *vidhi*
or *haṭha*), a blind power against which human wisdom and endeavour are
weak. Man is not even free to be prudent and wise, *deus quos vult
perdere prius dementat*, a formula which could be the motto of many an
episode in the Mahābhārata.

Buddhism does not deny the power of

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

destiny; but it maintains that destiny is only one's own former action.
A man is born from his own deeds, not from his parents, or more exactly
he has the parents he merits to have:

My action is my possession; my action is my inheritance; my action is
the matrix which bears me; my action is the race to which I belong; my
action is my refuge <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md).

As it is said:

All that we are is the result of what we have thought and done.

But the question is whether "all that we do now, in this present life,
is the result of what we have done"? The conception of destiny left some
room for free-will: does the doctrine of Karman, understood strictly as
the Buddhists are prompt to understand it, leave any loophole?

Here we are, as is often the case with Buddhism, in the very middle of a
jungle of contradictions.

On the one hand, Buddhist ontology does not admit the existence of an
agent, a doer (*kartar*):

No doer is there, naught save the deed is found.

There is no Self, but only a 'series' of physico-psychical phenomena. We
have seen that a volition is only the further state of a desire.

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

On the other hand, we are told that our actual dispositions are
inherited. A man is not cruel or covetous because he chooses to be so,
but because he has just been a tiger or a lustful animal.

Further, living beings are without real connexion one with another. They
are water-tight series of thoughts. Each of them eats the fruit of his
own actions. Accordingly Śākyamuni teaches that "Nobody can harm or
benefit another," for "The Self is the protector of the Self: what other
protector could the Self have?" The most powerful demon cannot harm a
man who has not merited to be crushed by him; and, inversely, Buddha
himself cannot favour a disciple with a lesson which this disciple has
not merited to receive.

 

The problem of free-will is a difficult one, but it can be said that
Buddhism has added difficulties and contradictions of its own to a
problem in itself difficult. These difficulties are the more striking in
Buddhism, because Buddhism, which flatly denies freedom and solidarity,
is essentially a discipline of endeavour and benevolence.

Buddhist philosophers, it is true, do not

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

hide these difficulties, but they do nothing to explain them away.

There is no self, no doer, no free agent: *kartā svatantro nāsti*; there
is only a succession of psychical states. Every Buddhist knows quite
well this essential truth: not only in the scholastical texts but even
in the common language, the word *saṃtāna* or *saṃtati*, 'series,' is
used for what we call a soul: "At this time the series which is now
named Śākyamuni was called Sunetra." "When the Scripture says that
consciousness (*vijñāna*) is to take up its abode in the matrix, the
meaning is \[not that a conscious Self is reincarnated, but\] that a
series of states of consciousness continues to develop in the embryo."

The Buddhist authors are always aware that the soul is only a series.
This does not prevent them from preaching endeavour as the only means of
salvation, and, without paying any attention to verbal contradictions,
they say: "The series is to be drawn against the flow of passions by
means of good acts, owing to a strong endeavour; the series must be
driven away from pleasurable objects." They do not explain how an
unsubstantial series of thoughts can draw itself against passions and
prejudices which are the series itself.

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

Just as the Christian philosophers—Calvin or the Jansenists—who strictly
limit or are inclined to deny human free-will, are nevertheless fairly
good 'teachers of energy,' in the same way Buddhists lay all the stress
of their teaching on the cultivation of endeavour, on self-restraint
(*saṃyama*, *saṃvara* <span id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52).md). The virtue
of energy (vīrya) is indispensable, for the struggle is hard against
lust, hate, and error. Śākyamuni was an 'enlightened one,' *buddha*; but
he was equally a hero, a conqueror, *vīra*, *jina*; and his disciples
must be worthy of such a king.

A most happy contradiction indeed.

A second contradiction is no less striking and happy.

Buddha is not a saviour. "Buddha is only a preacher; the path to
deliverance is open to everybody; but, according to their dispositions,
some will be delivered, some will not." Again, the very fact that we are
reborn as men, in Jambudvīpa, in India, at the time when Buddha opens
the Path, is the result of our own good deeds accumulated during many
ages of men. But Buddha looks twice every day in all directions in order
to see whether he can help some of his fellow creatures; owing to his
'eye of a

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Buddha,' he is
keen to perceive any 'root of merit' which any miserable and wretched
man can have stored up at any time in the past; he takes any trouble to
bring this 'root of merit' to maturity by appropriate sermons or
miracles. Owing to his strength of benevolence, he converts whomsoever
he will. His disciples are urged to imitate, in some way, the virtues
and the peaceful conquests of the Master. They have to practise the best
sort of gift, the gift of the Doctrine (*dharmadāna*); they have to
convert and edify sinners by friendship and benevolence.

To sum up, the doctrine of Karman is the root of morality. It makes
clear the necessity of "avoiding what is evil, practising what is good,
purifying one's thought"; and "that is," in short, "the rule of Buddha."
The idea that our enemies are only the delegates of our old sins will
make us patient and compassionate: "My enemies do harm to themselves
when they try to harm me; and they do not harm me, nay they are very
useful to me." But there are certain consequences of the doctrine of
Karman. What is to be said about denial of free-will, impossibility of
benevolent action? Buddhists see and plainly state these consequences,
for they are candid men and good

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

scholars. But they do not trouble themselves about them; they write and
they live as if they had not seen them.

In that they are wise, and they only follow the golden principle of
Śākyamuni. It happened one day that, being questioned on the doctrine of
Karman, he soberly answered: "My teaching is to do good deeds, to avoid
evil deeds." And, more than once, he ventured to say that this doctrine
is inconceivable or incomprehensible (*acintya*), that is to a human
mind, for a Buddha is omniscient.

#### IV

The variety of the material universe (*bhājanaloka*), including the
hells, the earth with the plants, and the heavens, depends upon some
cause.

To admit that things are such as they are, because they are such as they
are, that lotuses are lotuses, thorns thorns, owing to their own nature
(*svabhāva*), such is the doctrine of the philosophers 'who attribute
the origin of all things to chance' ('fortuitous-originists <span
id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53)'.md).

That is pure nonsense. The truth is that actions bear a 'fruit of
mastery' (*adhipatiphala*),

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

that is, they create or organize the material things necessary to their
reward.

A being is to be reborn as a god—the Sun god for instance—of such a
size, of such a physical beauty and strength, destined to live so many
ages of men. All these advantages are the 'fruit of ripening' of the
good deeds of this being. But this god must have an abode, a celestial
palace—the moving chariot, fifty miles in diameter that we call the Sun:
this palace is the 'fruit of mastery.'

In the same way, at the beginning of a cosmic period, the whole material
universe is created by the 'mastering' energy of the mass of the ancient
acts that are to be enjoyed by its future inhabitants. The 'receptacle
world' (*bhājanaloka*) is the 'fruit of mastery' of the mass of the acts
of the 'world of living beings' (*sattvaloka*).

#### V

Another aspect of Karman, Karman as a theogonic power, has never been
emphasized in Brahmanism as it is in Buddhism.

The Brahmans sometimes venture to think that the gods are not eternal or
immortal. The gods have reached a divine status by their pious doings,
their sacrifices, their penances—not necessarily by 'good' actions. It
is well known

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

that many gods are bad, fond of killing, stealing, wantonly destroying,
and that Śākyamuni did his best to tame them. The gods die when their
reserve of divinity is exhausted by the very experience of divine
pleasures: they are the happy or rather unhappy possessors of a 'peau de
chagrin' and, as the hero of Balzac, they know that it is drawing in.

Further the Brahman gods have to struggle for life, for their divine
life. While they are enjoying their reserve of power, there are in the
vast world ascetics who are heaping up penances and merits, penances and
merits which can be, at the will of the ascetics, turned into divinity
at the cost of the actual gods. The gods defend themselves as they can.
The Epic (*Mahābhārata*) contains numerous stories of temptations, when
the gods, anxious about the accumulating austerity of some Muni,
dispatch to him heavenly damsels to disturb his pious exercises. A
dangerous employ: Śakuntalā, the most charming child of Indian fancy,
was born in such circumstances; but Menakā, her mother, perished.
Śākyamuni himself was attacked by the daughters of Māra, the god of love
and death.

But this theogony in terms of merit, penance, or sacrifice, is, in
Brahmanism, only a theoretical

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

view and a literary topic. It does not endanger the traditional
mythology or jeopardize the status of the supreme god, whether Brahmā or
Viṣṇu or Śiva,—so many names for the Absolute.

In Buddhism, Karman and transmigration apply, in fact as in theory, to
all beings.

The position of the gods, when compared with the Buddhist saints, is a
subordinate one. It is true that the actions resulting in the present
happiness and power of the gods are good actions; but these actions were
accomplished through 'worldly' motives: the gods have reached the reward
for which they have been striving: *vani vanam*. A monk who has begun
his career towards a loftier aim, Nirvāṇa, is by far superior to the
gods, even in magic.

As concerns Brahmā, who according to the Brahmans is Īśvara, the Lord,
the universal sovereign who cares for everything, who takes account of
actions and governs the transmigration of individual beings, who designs
the successive creations of the universe after the successive periods of
chaos—the Buddhists do not recognize him. They know that an infinite
number of gods, each with the title of Brahmā, but having a separate
name of his own, have reigned in succession, each during a cosmic

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

period (*kalpa*). Such gods are great gods; they enjoy the fruit of very
good deeds, the fruit of very high meditations tinged with
altruism <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md); they are quasi spiritual,
non-sexual gods, but by no means sovereigns of the world, creators, or
overrulers of the retribution of actions.

When, at the beginning of a cosmic period <span
id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_55.md), after the chaos, the inferior part of the
universe is to be rebuilt, the heaven or palace of Brahmā is the first
part of the 'receptacle world' to appear, as the 'fruit of mastery' of
the actions of the being who is to be the Brahmā of the period. Then
this Brahmā is produced in this palace. As he does not remember his
former existences, he is apt to believe that he is born from himself,
that he is self-existent (*svayaṃbhū*). After a time, he gets tired of
his solitude; he thinks that servants and companions would be pleasant,
and, at the same moment, there are produced the gods Companions of
Brahmā; that is to say, owing to the special nature of their own acts,
certain beings are born in the Brahmā's palace. Brahmā, of course,
believes that he has created them, and they, in turn, believe that they
have been created by Brahmā. They

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

adore Brahmā, and this religion of Brahmā has been propagated among men.

This is brought out in the following story <span
id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md):

There was a monk indulging, against the teaching of the Master, in
cosmological inquiries. In order to know where the world ends, he began
journeying far away in the sky, interrogating in succession the gods of
the successive heavens. The gods 'Servants of the Four Kings of the
cardinal regions,' said to him: "Ask the Four Kings"; the Four Kings
said to him: "Ask the Thirty Three Gods.". . . The monk finally arrived
in the heaven of the Servants of Brahmā: "We, monk," said they, "do not
know where the world ends. But there is Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the
supreme one, the mighty one, the all seeing one, the ruler, the lord of
all, the controller, the creator, the chief of all, appointing to each
his place, the ancient of days, the father of all that are and are to
be. He will know that."—"Where then is that Great Brahmā now?" asked the
monk.—"We, monk, know not where Brahmā is, nor why Brahmā is, nor
whence." "But," added the gods, "he may suddenly appear." And, before
long, Brahmā indeed became manifest, and the monk asked him where the
world ends. Brahmā answered: "I am the Great Brahmā. . . the father of
all that are and are to be."—"I do not ask you, friend," said the monk,
"as to whether you are indeed all that you now say. But I ask you where
the four great elements—earth, water, fire and wind—cease, leaving no
trace behind." Then the Great Brahmā took that monk by the arm, led him
aside, and said: "These gods, my servants, hold me to be such that there
is nothing I cannot see, understand, realize. Therefore I gave no answer
in their presence. But I do not know where the world ends. . . . Go you
now,

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

return to the Lord, ask him the question, and accept the answer
according as he shall make reply." The monk returned to Śākyamuni who
told him: "Long ago, O monk, sea-faring traders were wont, when they
were setting sail on an ocean voyage, to take with them a land-sighting
bird. . . . Such a bird would fly to the East, and to the South. . .,
and if no land were visible, it would come back to the ship. Just so, O
monk, do you, having sought an answer to this question, even up to the
world of Brahmā, come back to me."

Śākyamuni is the only source of truth. It happened that the god Indra
met some monks, and wondered at the wisdom of their sayings: "Here is,"
he said, "a fine doctrine. Did you discover it by yourselves?" The monks
answered: "When there are to be seen, in the neighbourhood of a large
granary, men bearing corn, some in baskets, some in their robes, some in
their hands, it is not difficult to guess where the corn comes from. In
the same way, every 'good and true saying'. (*subhāṣita*) comes from the
Lord <span id="fr_57"></span>[1](#fn_57.md)."
