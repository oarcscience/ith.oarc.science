### CHAPTER III

### BUDDHIST DEFINITION OF KARMAN

I. Introductory. II. Ancient history of Karman. III. Karman is volition
and voluntary action. IV. Karman is moral action.

#### I

The Buddhist 'soul,' a series of physico-psychical states, would come to
an end at death, when the physical organism dissolves, but for the
strength of the actions which are to be enjoyed in a future life by a
new physico-psychical apparatus, a continuation of the first one.

Action, in Sanskrit, *karman*, is one of the Indian words that the
theosophists and the neo Buddhists have made known in the West. We must
feel grateful for it. For we can say shortly 'doctrine of Karman,'
meaning all the speculations concerned with action, and especially the
dogma of the ripening (*vipāka*) of action.

The doctrine of Karman is more than the belief in the reward of good
actions and the punishment of bad ones, here below or in another life;
such

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

a belief is a very common one and has nothing specifically Indian.

The doctrine of Karman presupposes the belief in transmigration and is
primarily a rationalistic and moral explanation of the variety of the
conditions of living beings through many consecutive existences.

By a rationalistic and moral explanation, we mean an explanation which
is founded on the principle of causality understood as follows: "The
good deed is rewarded, the evil deed is punished"; an explanation which
leaves no place or very little place for any theological, mystical or
superstitious agency: it is in the very nature of a good deed to produce
reward; reward is automatically produced, that is independently of any
exterior factor, out of the very potentiality of the good deed.

The deep reason of the origin and of the spread of this doctrine was,
without doubt, a sentiment of justice. It is not just that crime should
remain unpunished and virtue unrewarded. Unmerited suffering and
unmerited pleasure offend us for the same reason. Hence a certitude, a
sort of scientific certitude, first that sin is certain to turn into
pain and a good deed into pleasure, just as for the modern physicist
motion

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

turns into heat, and, second, that pain and pleasure are respectively
the product of sin and of virtue.

It may be said without exaggeration that this certitude has been, for
centuries, the strongest and most popular feeling of India. Even to-day,
in the castes which practise child marriage, young widows are looked
upon as criminal: "What a sinner you have been to lose your husband so
soon!"

With the Buddhists, the doctrine of Karman is, as a rule <span
id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34.md), strictly understood, and is almost
everything. In the case of the non-Buddhists, with the possible
exception of the 'religions of devotion' (*bhakti*), it is no less
important, although it is not understood strictly <span
id="fr_35"></span>[2](#fn_35.md).

We propose to examine the history of Karman, and the part of Buddhism in
this history. The conclusion of this inquiry will be (1) that the
Buddhists did not discover Karman, but (2) that they were among the
first to give a reasonable and moral definition of Karman. Moreover the
Buddhists alone were successful in drawing from the doctrine of Karman
all its consequences:

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

human destiny, cosmogony and theogony are, in Buddhism, built on Karman.

#### II

There were, at the time of Śākyamuni, (1) unbelievers, deniers of soul,
transmigration and action, (2) believers in transmigration and in
destiny, (3) believers in transmigration who foreshadowed the doctrine
of action, (4) believers in transmigration and in action.

 

We have, but briefly, studied the development of philosophical analysis
which, for a long time, had been destroying the old religious and
cosmical notions of the Āryas. This analysis created an esoteric
theology—literally a gnosis—took a pantheistic or monistic direction,
and finally made prominent the idea of the universal Self.

But that is only one of the branches of the philosophical evolution, the
'orthodox' branch, or the Vedic or Brahmanic branch properly so called.
In contrast with pantheists and mystics, there were materialists and
positivists—many more, as it seems, in old India than later.

Our sources, which are both Brahmanic and Buddhistic, agree on the
whole <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md). Brahmanic

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

sources lay much stress on the impiety of the 'would-be philosophers,'
'philosophasters' (*paṇḍitamānika*) who do not believe in the Veda and
in Sacrifice. Buddhists, who themselves broke with sacerdotalism and
theology, are especially preoccupied with the negation of soul and
future life.

 

The common name for the 'unbelievers' is *lokāyata*, mundane,' and
*nāstika*, 'negator,' 'denier,' people who say: *na asti*, 'it is not';
that is, when a priest or a mendicant wants an alms: "There is nothing
for you"; and also: "There is no such thing as a gift, a sacrifice, an
offering, a result of good or evil deeds"; "there is no mother, no
father": parents are not entitled to any respect; "no ascetic or Brahman
has discovered truth or can ascertain the reality of another life": the
sacerdotal tradition and the revelations of the holy men, leaders of
ascetic orders, are alike falsehoods and vain pretences to extort money.

The unbelievers had probably a sort of philosophy. When we get more
precise information concerning them, that is some centuries after the
time of Buddha, we are told that the Nāstikas were strong materialists,
in the modern meaning of the word. Man is made of material elements;

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

psychical phenomena are to be explained by the special possibilities of
these elements when combined in a certain mixture: just as a mixture of
rice and water develops an intoxicating power, in the same way
consciousness arises in the living body.

However it may be with the ancient Nāstikas, the old Buddhist texts
report their views as follows <span id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37.md):

Man is composed of four elements. When Man dies, the earthy element
returns and relapses into the earth; the watery element returns into the
water; the fiery element returns into the fire; the windy element
returns into the wind; the senses pass into space. Four men, with the
corpse as a fifth, go to the cemetery, murmuring prayers. But the bones
are bleached in the flame, and the offerings of the living perish in the
ashes of his pyre. Wise and fool alike, when the body dissolves, are cut
off, perish, do not exist any longer.

Thus spoke Ajita of the garment of hair.

Therefore, as says Purāṇa Kassapa:

There is no guilt for the man who mutilates or causes another to
mutilate, who kills, takes what is not given, breaks into houses,
commits dacoity, or robbery, or adultery; and so on. . . . Should he
make all living creatures one heap, one mass of flesh, there would be no
guilt. . . . Were he to go along the Ganges giving alms, and ordering
gifts to be given. . . there would be no merit. . . .

Such were the strange sermons of the unbelieving ascetics; for ascetics
had an absolute

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

right of preaching the truth. As says the King Ajātaśatru: "How should
such a one as I am, think of giving dissatisfaction to any ascetic or
Brahman in my realm?" In India, thought was free; opinion was no crime;
but evildoers were summarily dealt with.

 

Side by side with the thorough Nāstikas, a few philosophers, while
believing in soul and transmigration, denied action and reward.

There are eighty-four hundred thousand periods during which both fools
and wise alike, wandering in transmigration, will at last make an end of
pain. . . . The happiness and pain, measured out, as it were, with a
measure, cannot be altered in the course of transmigration; there can be
neither increase nor decrease thereof. Just as a ball of string will
stretch just as far as it can unwind, just so both fools and wise alike
are wandering in transmigration exactly for the allotted term.

There is no cause, either ultimate or remote, for the depravity or
rectitude of beings; they become depraved or pure without reason and
without cause. There is no such thing as power or energy or human
strength or human vigour. Beings are bent this way or that by their
fate, by their individual nature.

Nor were the Brahmans very clear concerning the power which
predetermines transmigration. It is true that references to Karman are
not wanting:

The spirit, at death, takes upon itself another new form, a form of
Fathers or of Gandharvas, of divine or

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

human nature, or of any other kind of being. . . . As he acted and as he
walked, so he becomes. He who does good becomes a good being, he who
does bad becomes a bad being; he becomes pure by pure action, evil by
evil action.

Elsewhere we meet a formula which is distinctly Buddhistic in tone and
in meaning.

Man's nature depends on desire. As his desire, so is his aspiration; as
his aspiration, so is the course of action which he pursues; whatever be
the course of action he pursues, he passes to a corresponding state of
being.

But, according to an important passage in the same book, the doctrine of
Karman is a new doctrine, a doctrine to be kept secret. In the course of
a philosophical tournament—such tournaments are not a rarity from the
oldest times down to Akbar—Jāratkārava Ārtabhāga questions Yājñavalkya
on the destiny of the dead, and the celebrated Brahman answers: "Give me
your hand, my friend; we two alone must be privy to this; not a word on
that subject where people are listening." And the narrator dryly
summarizes the debate they had privately: "What they said, they said
regarding action; by pure action, man becomes pure."

To sum up, references to Karman are not numerous in the old Brahman
literature, the

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Brāhmaṇas or
Upaniṣads. In the view of the authors of these books, sacrifice and
esoteric wisdom are much more important than Karman. But it is only
natural that liturgical treatises (Brāhmaṇas) should consider sacrifice
as the best means of improving future life; and, as concerns the
philosophico-mystical treatises (Upaniṣads), they deal chiefly with the
merging of the individual Self in the great Self; the common idea is
that this great aim can be realized by the possession of a mystic
wisdom; and accordingly the Upaniṣads are little concerned with the
problem of action and reward. Therefore we are not justified in arguing,
from the relative silence of the old texts, that the doctrine of Karman
was not already widely known.

 

The best reason we have for believing that the doctrine of Karman was
not new, but was widely known at the time of Śākyamuni, is to be found
in the very teaching of Śākyamuni and in the history of the church.

Many, among the ascetics who joined the primitive brotherhood, were
believers in Karman. The Jaṭilas, the 'ascetics with matted hair,' were
to be admitted without the noviciate or probation of three months
imposed on others, "because

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

they believe in Karman." The Master, for this reason, made an exception
to the rule which wisely secured a thorough preparation for full
admission to the Order <span id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_38.md).

But our point is that the teaching of Śākyamuni on Karman is in no way
an improvisation, and clearly obtains a success which it could not have
obtained if it had been new. Śākyamuni taught a path to deliverance,
because many people were anxious to get deliverance. The same holds good
for Karman. Human destiny, free will, the efficacy of penance for
destroying sin,—together with such questions as 'Is the soul the body?',
'Is the universe infinite?'—were the topics of lively discussions among
hermits and mendicants; while the laymen, who actually fed all these
troops of spiritual men, took great interest in these philosophumena and
were disposed to admit the doctrine of Karman. This doctrine, as well as
the doctrine of transmigration which it so happily completes, was
already deeply rooted in the popular feeling.

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

#### III

As far as we can surmise—there are many more conjectures than
ascertained facts in this old history—Śākyamuni was the first or one of
the first to give a reasonable and moral definition of Karman.

That appears from the comparison between the Buddhists and the Jains, a
powerful mendicant order which originated or was reorganized a few years
before Śākyamuni.

The Jains are, in many respects, very much like the Buddhists, so much
like that the different origin of the two sects was for a long time
denied. They are good atheists—they even object to the common Indian
saying, *devo varṣati*, Ζεὺς ὕει; they believe that Karman is the
governing force in human destiny.

But they cherish the most materialistic idea of Karman. They are of
opinion that bodily and verbal actions are important, that they create a
subtle matter that envelops the soul and produces retribution—whereas
mental action is weak, inefficacious.

Buddhism, on the contrary, teaches that there is no Karman without
consciousness and even premeditation.

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

Karman is twofold: (1) volition (*cetanā*), or mental or spiritual
action (*mānasa*), and (2) what is born from volition, what is done by
volition, 'what a person does after having willed,' namely bodily and
verbal action <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md).

By giving gold, while intending to give a stone, a gift of gold is
indeed made; but, as it has not been premeditated or willed, the act is
as if it were not done. It is not 'appropriated'; it is not 'stored up'
(*upacita*); it will bear no fruit. In the same way, if a man kills his
mother when striking at what is believed to be a pumpkin, there is no
matricide, there is no murder, there is only destruction of a fruit.

The Jains criticize this doctrine strongly, and would believe that the
unintentional murderer of his mother is a hideous criminal. The man who
commits murder, or who harms in any way a living being, without intent,
is none the less guilty, just as a man who touches fire is burned.

But this would lead to palpable absurdities. The embryo and the mother
would be guilty of making each other suffer. The murdered man himself
would be guilty, for he is the object and therefore the origin of the
action of murder.

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Further the
comparison of the fire is not a happy one: a man would not be guilty of
murder if he got another person to commit it, for we are not burnt when
we touch fire by means of another. Again unconscious sin would be more
heavy than conscious sin: a man who touches hot iron without knowing
that it is hot, is likely to be more deeply burnt than the man who
knows <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md).

 

This contrast of the Buddhist doctrine with the Jain doctrine draws our
attention to this fact that the views of Śākyamuni, which seem to us
reasonable indeed, but rather evident, were bold and new, and of
far-reaching consequences.

To take the risk of acquitting the unintentional murderer was in fact to
break with the immemorial conception of sin. We do not mean that, in the
oldest times, a moral conception of duty and sin did not exist; but sin
was also looked upon as a sort of contagious fluid, a sort and the most
dangerous sort of impurity. One becomes sinful, hateful to gods and men,
not

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

only by sinful acts, but also by kinship or any sort of contact.

A consequence of this materialistic conception is that sin is to be
dispelled by physical contrivances, is to be burnt out by penances
(*tapas*), by the heat penance—standing between the four penitential
fires, with the sun above—when the sin is as it were 'extracted' from
the body along with the perspiration. Or the sin is to be washed away by
baths, especially by baths in the holy water of the Ganges.

These old and always living speculations have been somewhat
spiritualized in some Indian religions, but Buddhism alone radically
ignores or cancels them. We must consider this definition, "Karman is
volition, and bodily or verbal action which follows volition," as one of
the steps in the history of the Indian thought.

Volition is all important. Our future depends on our present volition,
and our present state depends on our past volition.

All that we are is the result of what we have thought; it is founded on
our thoughts; it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts
with an evil thought, pain follows him, as the wheel follows the foot of
the ox that draws the wagon.

We are what we think, we are what we will.

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

While emphasizing the all-importance of volition, Buddhism does not
minimize the importance of bodily and verbal action, the action that a
person does after having willed. To forsake the secular life and
actually join the Buddhist Brotherhood is an entirely different thing
from resolving to do so. To kill a man is more hideous than to resolve
to kill a man. It is true that, in the case of a Rishi, endowed with
magical power, the resolve to kill actually kills; but in the case of
ordinary mortals murder supposes a will strong and persistent.

A point of the later scholasticism is worth mentioning. While a pure
volition only leaves traces (*vāsanā*) in the series of thoughts, bodily
and verbal actions—which are corporeal and material—create a thing of a
particular nature, semi-material (*rūpa*) and semi-spiritual, which is
called 'action,' although it is really a result of action. Scholastics
name it *avijñapti*. Once produced by a voluntary verbal or bodily
action (*vijñapti*), the *avijñapti* exists and develops of its own
accord, without the agency of thought, whether a man is waking, sleeping
or absorbed in contemplation.

The idea which gave rise to the conception of *avijñapti* is clear
enough. A man who has taken the vows (*saṃvara*) of the religious life
by a solemn declaration (*vijñapti*)—a verbal action—is not a man like
others. He has engaged himself to avoid certain actions, killing,
stealing, etc., during his life-time. He is not always pondering over
this engagement during sleep or at any

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

other time; nevertheless as long as he has not formally given up his
vows or committed an action contrary to his vows, he remains a man who
has taken the vows, literally 'who is restrained (*saṃvṛta*)'; his
avoidance of sinful actions is another thing than the casual avoidance
of sinful actions by a man who has taken no vows.

An action, to be 'complete' and really 'fruitful,' apt to 'ripen,' must
consist of three parts: (1) the preparation, that is the first volition
and all the contrivances necessary to the so-called 'principal action.'
For instance, a butcher arises, takes some money, goes to the market,
buys a goat, has the knife in his hand; (2) the principal action: the
killing of the goat, the actual death-dealing blow; (3) the 'back' of
the principal action: the cutting up and selling of the meat, etc.

The Buddhist theory of confession is based upon these considerations.
The moral benefit or merit (*puṇya*) of a gift is totally or almost
totally lost for the giver if he regrets his generosity; in the same way
a sin is not done, it is only half done, if one regrets one's sin.
Confession, as it is practised by the Buddhist monks, is not a
sacramental rite; it is an expression of repentance, an affirmation: "I
will not do it again," and also the accomplishment of one of the vows

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

of a monk: "I will not tell lies." Confession does not destroy sin; but
it is the intention of concealing sin that makes sin 'complete.'

#### IV

According to the Buddhists, the only action (*karman*) is volition and
intentional word and deed; further action, to be complete, must be
'prepared'—not casual or impulsive—and 'backed up,' approved of
afterwards, not counteracted by repentance.

It must be added that Buddhists lay all the stress on the morality of
actions, and in this was a marked progress.

Morality, of course, was not unknown in ancient India; but, to say the
least, the ideas were somewhat confused by ritual prejudice. In
Buddhism, all the intricate fabric of the rites of purification and of
sacrifice falls to the ground. Whereas it was thought that Indra, King
of the gods, had obtained his sovereignty through a hundred sacrifices
(hence his name, Śatakratu), Buddhists believe that sacrifice is of no
avail, that sacrificial murder is a murder. Whereas austerities and
purifications of many kinds were deemed necessary, Buddhists condemn
them as

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

so many superstitions (*śīlavrata*). In the same way they abandon the
most pious among the pious works of yore, gifts to the dead, funeral
rites: the monks took no care of the funeral of Śākyamuni himself.

Morality alone makes the value of an act.

 

The fact has often been emphasized that the Buddhist rule of morality
is, or seems to be, a purely negative one: to avoid the ten sins. "Do
not kill, do not take what is not given, do not indulge in illicit
love,"—three bodily sins. "Do not use mischievous, rude, mendacious,
foolish language,"—four verbal sins. "Do not cherish lust, hatred, wrong
doctrines, especially the doctrine that there is annihilation at
death,"—three mental sins.

A layman has to accept this tenfold discipline or restraint (*saṃvara*)
to be admitted as a 'devotee' (*upāsaka*). Monks take a more strict
discipline: for instance, they renounce not only illicit love, but also
marriage; but the negative character of their morality (*bhikṣutā*) is
the same as it is for laymen.

Are we to conclude that positive morality, altruism or love, is foreign
to the Buddhist ideal of conduct? As is well known, scholars disagree.

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> R. Pischel,
following Taine, has maintained that love of one's neighbour is the
leading motive of Buddhism <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md).

It may be first observed that Indian philosophers have been from of old
keen enough to understand that man has always in view his own interest,
even when he seems to be the most generous and disinterested. They have
discovered La Rochefoucauld long ago. "It is for the sake of Self that
Man loves cattle, wife, sons or riches," says the Upaniṣad. And
Śākyamuni comforts the king Prasenajit and his wife the queen Mallikā
('Jessamine'); this loving pair ashamed at discovering that each of them
preferred his or her Self to anybody else: "I do not see," says
Śākyamuni, "any living being in the three worlds who does not prefer his
own Self to anything <span id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_42.md)."

Self-love, self-love well understood <span
id="fr_43"></span>[3](#fn_43.md), governs all the actions of a Buddhist,
whether monk or layman.

The monk has arrived at a stage in the spiritual career when a purely
egoist behaviour is necessary. The monk has not to practise

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

good actions,—such actions he has done in heaps in former births,—he has
only to avoid evil actions, to avoid any occasion of an evil action, to
extinguish desire. His ideal is absence of desire, absence of action.
The monk has broken natural and social bonds; he has no obligation
towards his former wife, his former children <span
id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md).

The case is quite different as concerns the layman. The layman has to
acquire merit, he has to do positive acts of morality, good acts. "A
good act is the act that benefits one's neighbour; a bad act, the act
that harms one's neighbour <span id="fr_45"></span>[2](#fn_45.md)."

Such a dogmatical definition of good and evil is scarce, and as a rule
the morality of acts is to be known by their fruits: "A good act is an
act that ripens into a pleasurable existence; a bad act, an act that
begets suffering." Proofs are innumerable that Buddhists recommend good
acts of every description. A man who does not commit any sin will be
reborn as a man, not as an inhabitant of hell, an animal or a ghost; but
if this sinless person is wanting in positive

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

meritorious actions, especially in giving, he will be reborn as a poor
man. Whereas a generous man, who has indulged in some sin, will, it is
true, pay for this sin by rebirth in an inferior state (hell, etc.); but
he will also, after being released from the ties of sin, enjoy on this
earth, as a rich man, or in heaven, as a god, the fruit of his gifts.

 

Among meritorious actions, giving is the most fruitful. It may be
interesting to state the principles of the valuation of the merit of
giving.

One must take into account:

1\. The qualities of the giver, faith, morality learning, and his
intention in giving: 'I give in order to receive in my turn,' 'I give
because I have received,' 'I give because my parents and grand-parents
were wont to give. . . .'

2\. The manner of giving: with respect, with the right hand, at the
opportune moment.

3\. The qualities of the object given, excellence in colour, smell, and
so on. There is nevertheless an episode parallel to the widow's mite.

4\. The qualities of the person who receives, that is, as Indians say,
the 'field' (*kṣetra*) on which the gift is poured. Much depends, in
Buddhism and in Brahmanism, on the fertility of the field. Our sources
distinguish (*a*) the

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

excellence in relation to the kind of existence: a gift to a wicked man
has a hundred times the value of a gift to an animal; (*b*) the
excellence due to suffering: gifts to the poor and to the sick are
especially productive of fruit; (*c*) the excellence due to services
received: our parents are our benefactors and have a right to our gifts;
the preacher, who teaches us the Buddhist doctrine, gives us a second
birth, better than the first; (*d*) last not least, the excellence due
to qualities, morality, knowledge, in a word to sanctity. Buddhists are
not as jealous as the Brahmans, and Śākyamuni extols the gifts made to
the ascetics of the rival sects. But a Buddhist monk is evidently a
better 'field' than a heretic. A gift to a Buddha, small as it may be,
is very good indeed.

The gift given by a man who does not care for reward, who gives in order
to free himself from greed, who understands fully the Buddhist
doctrine,—that is, who knows the unsubstantiality (*nairātmya*) of the
giver, of the gift and of the receiver,—that is the best gift.

 

The confusion of 'good' (*kuśala*) and 'meritorious,' 'bearing a
pleasant fruit' (*puṇya*), which seems to be one of the consequences of

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

the doctrine of Karman as understood by the Buddhists, leads to some
results that are not perfectly sound. For instance, a man will abandon
secular life in order to be reborn as a god and to enjoy pleasures
incomparably greater than the pleasures of human life. The story of
Nanda is a good illustration of this case: once this relative of
Śākyamuni realizes that his wife cannot vie with the celestial
damsels—just as the female apes cannot vie with his wife—he becomes a
monk, for he will obtain, through actual continence, sensual pleasures
of the highest degree <span id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md).

An action is good when it does not aim at immediate (*aihika*) ends,
when it is made in order to obtain reward in a future life; it is bad
when it aims at an immediate end, viz. pleasure in this life. This rule,
practically a golden rule, is possibly a little too empirical. But to
appreciate it without prejudices, we must remember, first, that a system
of morals is not to be estimated from the details of casuistry, and,
second, that the true Buddhist is the man who does not care for merit or
reward, but who strives for Nirvāṇa.

(chapter IV) forgets that Nāgasena teaches Milinda the very Jain
doctrine and the simile of the fire. In this connexion, compare Plato on
the 'lie in the soul' (*Rep*. Bk. II, 382), and Bourdaloue on the
'fausse conscience.'

<span id="fn_45"></span>[76:2](w2n05.htm#fr_45.md) The *Abhidharmakośa*
states that 'wrong view' (see above, [p. 46](w2n04.htm#page_46).md) is a
sin; then it proceeds to discuss this statement: "How can it be said
that 'wrong view' is a sin since a good act is the act that benefits
one's neighbour. . . ."
