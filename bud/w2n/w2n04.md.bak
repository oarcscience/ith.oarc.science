### CHAPTER II

### THE BUDDHIST SOUL

I. Buddhism a form of rationalism. II. Buddhist psychology;
contradictions. III. There is no Self: Man is a chariot. IV. There is
reward of actions in a future life. V. Whether Buddhists deny rebirth or
migration of a soul, while maintaining migration of *karman* or
character. VI. Buddhists admit a sort of soul.

#### I

We have given a general definition of the Indian disciplines of
salvation and tried to make clear that they are Paths leading. the
ascetic, beyond the ocean of transmigration, to some mysterious
somewhere. Buddhism has been, from the beginning, a religion, a religion
properly so called; that is, there have been, from the beginning,
Buddhists for whom Buddha was a god and who did not hope for a better
state than rebirth in Buddha's heaven; but this Buddhist religion has
nothing or little to do with the most authentic teaching of Śākyamuni.
Old Buddhism is essentially a discipline of salvation,—and this
discipline widely differs from the other disciplines of salvation.

If we were asked to characterise in a word the

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

old Buddhist discipline of salvation and the old Buddhism as a whole, we
should say that it is a form of rationalism. Every idea and every
practice made use of by Śākyamuni to build up his theory and his rule of
religious life have been freed from any tinge of mysticism.

Four points may be distinguished.

1\. The most conspicuous and 'buddhistic' feature of Buddhist
rationalism is the definition Śākyamuni and his disciples give of Man.
Man is to be delivered from transmigration; but what do we mean by the
word 'man'? Much depends on the answer, which will be studied in this
chapter.

2\. As concerns transmigration and the factors that govern
transmigration, the rivals of Śākyamuni believe that God, or the gods,
or destiny, or sacrifice are of greater or less importance. Śākyamuni,
on the contrary, teaches that transmigration depends on the actions of
Man himself <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md).

3\. As concerns the aim to be reached, deliverance. For the rivals of
Śākyamuni, deliverance is either the merging of the individual Self in
the great Self, or some mystical state of the Self; while Śākyamuni
takes a merely negative view of deliverance: the Buddhist deliverance or
Nirvāṇa is only cessation of rebirth, end of misery <span
id="fr_12"></span>[2](#fn_12.md).

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

4\. As concerns the Path leading to deliverance, the rivals of Śākyamuni
lay much stress on sacrifice, penance, ecstasies, esoteric wisdom, as
means to deliverance. With Śākyamuni, the essential part of the Path is
the understanding of a few very simple truths: 'Life ends in death,'
'Everything is misery <span id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md).'

 

We say that old Buddhism was rationalistic, thoroughly rationalistic;
but this thoroughness was not absolute, and could not be absolute. This
fact must be borne in mind, even when the rationalistic character of
Buddhism is emphasized, if we are to avoid the mistake of some
historians who describe the old Buddhists according to the pattern of
the agnostics or the materialists of to-day.

Buddhism originated in pagan and mystical surroundings. It is true that
it succeeded in explaining the cosmos and human destiny without having
recourse to any metaphysical agent; that it succeeded in making all the
popular beliefs—belief in transmigration, in paradises, in hells, in
magical powers—and nearly all the ascetic practices—penances and
ecstasies—subservient to its own rationalistic ideals and principles.

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But it did not
reject these beliefs, it did not contest the efficacy of these
practices: these beliefs and these practices are, in fact, essential
parts of the Buddhist doctrine.

Buddhism, therefore—we mean the Buddhism of the Books and of the most
learned monks—is a rationalism, but a qualified, an Indian rationalism.

Moreover, this rationalism is not always consistent with itself. A
number of inconsistencies might be quoted. For example the teaching of
the Master was strict on the point that merit is strictly personal. But
old India believed that merit, together with its reward, is something
that can be given by one individual to another. A doctrine of the
transfer of merit was tacitly lurking in some Buddhist circles and found
expression in several passages of the Scripture. We are told that the
right means of helping the dead is not to give them offerings, but to
make gifts to the living for the benefit of the dead; that the right
means of rendering homage to the deities is not to worship them, but to
give them a share in our own pious works. Later this doctrine of the
transfer of merit became the leading idea of neo-Buddhism (Mahāyāna) and
was developed into a dogma

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

comparable, in many respects, to the Christian dogma of the communion of
saints.

#### II

The Buddhist definition of Man is summarized in a word, *nairātmya*,
'selflessness,' not, as usually translated, 'soullessness.' The matter
is somewhat difficult, the more so because we do not agree with the
common opinion of scholars, and we cannot avoid discussing this opinion.

Two facts are well ascertained and beyond discussion: (1) Śākyamuni does
not admit the existence of a Self (*ātman*), a permanent individual; he
teaches that the so-called Self is a compound of material and spiritual
data called *skandhas*; (2) but he nevertheless teaches reward of
actions in a future life. There is, *prima facie*, a contradiction.

The common explanation of this contradiction is as follows: Śākyamuni
teaches annihilation at death, and denies rebirth or transmigration; but
he believes that, owing to the strength of actions, a new being is
created who is to inherit the actions of the dead man and to enjoy their
fruit. A man dies and is dead for ever, but his goodness or wickedness
persists and causes another man to be born.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

We shall show, to the best of our power, that this explanation lacks the
support of the texts and is inadmissible; and we shall set forth the
doctrine which is clearly delineated by the Buddhists themselves—not, it
is true, by the oldest Buddhists. There is not a Self, a permanent
substantial unity, but there is a person, to be described as 'a living
continuous fluid complex,' which does not remain quite the same for two
consecutive moments, but which continues for an endless number of
existences, bridging an endless number of deaths, without becoming
completely different from itself.

#### III

The primitive psychology, in India as elsewhere, was 'animistic.'

There is a principle of life and heat, which moves the body, feels and
wills. This principle, although it is often identified with the breath
(*prāṇa*), is not a spiritual entity. Rather is it a semi-material soul,
or an impalpable body—a 'subtle body' (*sūkṣma śarīra*) as the Indians
say—a double which, during life, may abandon the gross body, its fleshly
abode, when for instance it travels far away in dreams; and which, at
death, finally flies away by an aperture

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

at the top of the head, only to be reincarnated elsewhere.

The Brahmans started from these 'animistic' views to develop a
metaphysical psychology, quite different from the theories of the West.
It must never be forgotten that the Indian philosopher found his
materials, not in Nature, through a direct and scientific observation,
but in the crude surmises of the popular or ritualistic tradition. A
strong and truly philosophical thought came into contact, not with real
and ascertained facts, but with wild speculations. The result is often
somewhat bewildering.

The leading principle of the philosopher was that what is transitory
cannot be the Self. He therefore distinguished two constituents. The
first one is the subtle body of the old 'animistic' belief: subtle
elements, subtle earth, water, wind and fire, making subtle organs of
sensation, one of which is the mind. The second constituent is an
everlasting and spiritual principle, the Self that is enveloped in the
subtle body, in the semi-material soul.

On the nature of the S elf the Brahmans do not agree. Two schools are
prominent, the Sāṃkhya and the Vedānta.

According to Sāṃkhya, there are many Selves,

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

called *puruṣa*, a word which means Man. They are eternal, unmodifiable
and passive, producing nothing and doing nothing; they are enveloped in
the subtle body; they illuminate the play of the senses and of the mind;
they experience pleasure and disgust; they migrate from existence to
existence "until the day when, fully satiated and recognising themselves
as distinct from matter, they break partnership with it and return to
their primeval liberty and unconsciousness <span
id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md)." The Self has no longer anything to
illuminate.

With the second school or Vedānta, there is only one Self, the great,
unique and unmodifiable Self, another name of which is Brahman. This
unique Self becomes multiform in appearance, owing to the diversity of
the material envelopes in which it is wrapped; these envelopes—as well
as the whole cosmos—are the creation, the 'magic' of the Self; but it
does not know. When it knows, the illusions come to an end and the Self
is delivered from individuality and from pain.

In both these systems, the Self is, as the philosophers say,
transcendent to the psychical life. For Sāṃkhya, the Self is only a
light that illuminates the play of senses and mind, which

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

are material and by themselves unconscious; for Vedānta, only a magician
who takes interest in the magical shows that he unwillingly creates; for
Sāṃkhya and Vedānta, 'ideation' is exterior to the Self. The question is
whether it is not possible to dispense with such a Self. Śākyamuni
answers in the affirmative.

 

The Buddhist psychology, in sharp contrast with Brahman
psychologies—and, it may be said, with nearly all psychologies—avoids or
pretends to avoid any metaphysical surmise. It is built up of facts, of
the facts that seemed, in that old time, to be scientifically
ascertained. And it is a surprise that, but for one
point—transmigration—the theory concocted by the yellow-garbed monks of
yore agrees closely with one of the modern theories of the soul, the
theory of Hume or Taine and of many scientists.

According to the Buddhists, no Self, that is, no unity, permanent
feeling or thinking entity, comes into the field of inquiry. We know
only the body, which is visibly a composite, growing and decaying thing,
and a number of phenomena, feelings, perceptions, wishes or wills,
cognitions—in philosophic language, a number of states of consciousness.
That these states of consciousness

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

depend upon a Self, are the product of a Self or arise in a Self, is
only a surmise, since there is no consciousness of a Self outside these
states of consciousness; and a wrong surmise, since there cannot be
connexion between 'being' and 'becoming': "There are perceptions, but we
do not know a perceiver."

As a matter of fact, we are well aware of the origin of perceptions, of
the origin of all the states of consciousness.

There is an organism, a physico-psychical organism. On the one hand, the
gross body, with the five gross organs, eye and so on. On the other
hand, the subtle body, that is, the five true organs, subtle eye and so
on, and the intellectual organ, the mind: an organ, made of subtle
matter like the visual organ, which knows ideas as the visual organ sees
colours.

There are exterior objects which are brought into contact with this
organism.

Thus arises consciousness <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md): "The
colour blue being given, the organ of the eye being also given, there
arises a contact which originates a visual knowledge, namely a blue
image." This image is at once elaborated by the mind which

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

creates an intellectual or mental knowledge in giving a name to the
object: "that is blue."

Hence follows a sensation, pleasant or unpleasant, which produces desire
or disgust, which in turn produces an act of volition, an action. Buddha
is reported to have said that "there is action, but there is not an
agent."

A very bold statement, but a very logical one. For what the heretics,
that is the Brahmans, call a Self is not an individual, but a complex of
elements, some of which are material (*rūpa*) and gross—the visible
body—some of which are material and subtle—the organs properly
so-called—some of which are non-material (*arūpin*)—the states of
consciousness, feeling, naming, will, cognition. Man is made of these
elements (*skandhas*) <span id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md); he is a
compound; and no compound can be an individual, a being.

This position, denial of any entity—a soul—"which gives unity and
permanence to what we call the individual," is to be justified by
intricate speculations, both in the East, with the Buddhists, and in the
West, with our modern psychologists. But it is very simple in itself,
and was made intelligible to any one by similes.

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

The best known is the simile of the chariot; it is referred to in our
oldest documents (*Saṃyutta*), and it is explained at length in the
'Questions of King Milinda' (*Milindapañha*), a collection of dialogues
between .a Buddhist sage, Nāgasena, and the King Menander, one of the
successors of Alexander in the Far East, sovereign of North West India
in the second century B.C. There are some reasons to believe that this
*enfant perdu* of Hellenism was converted to Buddhism; and his
conversion began as follows:

 

Milinda asks: "What is your name?"

"I am known as Nāgasena; but Nāgasena is only a term, appellation,
designation, mere name, mere empty sound, for there an individual does
not exist."

"But," says Milinda, "if the individual does not exist, who is it then
who furnishes you monks with robes, food and so on? Who is it who keeps
the precepts of Buddha? Who is it who abandons these precepts and
commits sin? In that case, if there is no individual, there is no merit,
no demerit; neither is he a murderer who kills a monk, nor can you,
monks, have any teacher or preceptor or ordination. Do answer me, are
not your nails, teeth, skin, flesh Nāgasena? are not your body,
feelings, sensations, volitions, cognitions Nāgasena?"

Nāgasena answers in the negative and Milinda concludes: "You speak a
falsehood, a lie"; for, when one speaks of Nāgasena one has in view the
body of Nāgasena: "Nāgasena is fat or tall," and the 'soul' of Nāgasena:
"Nāgasena is wise, Nāgasena strives for Nirvāṇa."

Milinda is now to be questioned in his turn: "You

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

are of noble birth, prince, and if you walk in the middle of the day on
hot sandy ground, it is very bad for your feet, your body and your mind.
Pray, did you come on foot or in a chariot?"—"I came in a chariot."—"If
you came in a chariot, explain to me what a chariot is. Is the pole the
chariot?"

Milinda confesses that neither the pole, nor the axle, nor the wheels,
nor the frame, nor the yoke, nor any part of the chariot is the chariot;
and Nāgasena concludes: "When you said: 'I came in a chariot,' you spoke
a falsehood, a lie; there is no chariot <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md)."

For, as it is said elsewhere:

Just as the word 'chariot' is but a mode of expression for axle, wheels,
and other constituent members, placed in a certain relation to each
other; but, when we come to examine the members one by one, we discover
that, in an absolute sense, there is no chariot; just as the words
'house,' 'fist,' 'lute,' 'army,' 'city,' 'tree,' are only modes of
expression for collections of certain things disposed in a certain
manner, in exactly the same way, the words 'living being' and 'ego' are
only modes of expression for a complex of bodily and non-bodily
constituents <span id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md).

The problem of the whole and the parts (*avayava*, *avayavin*) has been,
in India, the topic of long and abstruse discussions. The Buddhists
maintain that the whole is only an *ētre de raison*; their opponents are
as clever as they are. That

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

this problem is a real one, not a mere logomachy, is made clear by the
following remark which well summarizes Nāgasena's thought: "If you infer
an entity behind an individual man, you must also logically infer it
behind every individual thing, such as a chariot. Buddhists reject both
entities, and Plato equally logically accepts both," when he recognizes
in a bed "the existence of some one Form, which includes the numerous
particular things to which we apply the same name" (*Rep*. x) <span
id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md).

 

But it may be urged that, among the constituents of the Self, there is a
constituent which is likely to be the very Self: the mind or thought or
consciousness, the thing that exerts itself, that keeps the memory of
its feelings and exertions.

Śākyamuni was well aware of this objection, and he scornfully rejects
it <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md).

Men, in general, even the non-Buddhists, willingly agree that this body,
composed of the four elements, earth, water, air and fire, is not the
Self; they easily divest themselves of passion for it: the increase and
the wasting away of the body are manifest enough. "But that, O monks,
which is called mind, thought, consciousness, here the non-Buddhist sees
his own Self, and he

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

is incapable of divesting himself of passion for it. Why do I say so?
Because, from time immemorial, from the beginning of transmigration
which is without beginning, the non-Buddhist has held, cherished and
loved this notion: 'this is mine, this I am, this is my Self.' But it is
less foolish to consider the body composed of the four elements as a
Self, rather than the mind. Why do I say so? Because it is evident, O
monks, that this body lasts for one year, for two, three, four, five,
ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years, lasts for a hundred years and
even more. But that, O monks, which is called mind, thought,
consciousness, keeps up an incessant round, by day and by night, of
perishing as one thing and springing up as another."

The conclusion that seems to be forced upon us has been vividly drawn by
Rhys Davids <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md):

Śākyamuni acknowledged the reality of the emotional and intellectual
dispositions, but he refused absolutely to look upon them as a unity.
The position is so absolute, so often insisted on, so fundamental to the
right understanding of primitive Buddhism that it is essential there
should be no mistake about it. Yet the position is also so original, so
fundamentally opposed to what is usually understood as religious belief,
both in India and elsewhere, that there is great temptation to attempt
to find a loophole through which at least a covert or esoteric belief in
a soul, and in the future life (that is of course of a soul), can be
recognized, in some sort of way, as part of so widely accepted a
religious system. There is no loophole, and the efforts to find one have
always met with unswerving opposition both in the Scriptures (Piṭakas)
themselves and in extra-canonical works.

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

#### IV

Are we to admit this conclusion?

If Man is a chariot, if there is no soul, there is no free will, no
responsibility, no sin, no merit, no future life, no reward of actions
in a future life. The remarks of Menander hold good. But it is an
ascertained fact that, from the beginning, Buddhism waged an obstinate
war against the materialists or unbelievers, the Nāstikas, that is, the
philosophers who say: "It is not," who deny the reward of good actions
and the punishment of bad ones in a future life.

We shall see <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) that these unbelievers
were numerous at the time of Śākyamuni—an epoch of philosophic
analysis—and that Śākyamuni, who is as a rule described as a denier of
soul, may be more exactly described as a strong maintainer of
responsibility and future life. He said:

To say that Man, when the body dissolves, is cut off, perishes, does not
exist any longer, that is heresy, heretical belief, heretical jungle,
heretical wilderness.

It is more than a heresy; it is the heresy; it is what is called
technically 'wrong view'

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (*mithyādṛṣṭi*),
the most dangerous and wicked among human errors and sins <span
id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) as it is destructive of all morality, and
precipitates the unbeliever into hell: "You say that there is no future
life. Well! the executioners of Yama, the king and the judge of the
dead, will soon change your opinion on the matter."

So much for the dogmatic evidences.

On the other hand, the texts which affirm the reward of actions, and the
personal character of this reward, are innumerable. There are hundreds
of Birth stories, Jātakas, legendary and moral tales, stories of the
days of yore: all end in the same stereotyped sentences with the so
called identification of the characters: "What do you think, O
monks?—says Buddha—I was then the wise white elephant, Devadatta was the
wicked hunter."

Elsewhere:

Ānanda—the beloved disciple—has committed such an act. Who will enjoy
the fruit of this act but Ānanda?

But the most emphatic affirmation of the

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

personality of reward is perhaps to be found in the beautiful text
(Devadūtasutta) which narrates the meeting of the sinner with Yama <span
id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md):

Have you, O man, when you reached old age, thought within yourself: 'I
am subject. . . to death; well, then! I will do good in thought, word
and deed'?. . . These your evil deeds your mother has not done, nor your
father, nor your brother, nor your sister, nor your friends and
advisers, nor your connexions and blood relatives, nor ascetics, nor
Brahmans, nor gods. It is you alone who have done these evil deeds; you
alone will enjoy their fruit.

#### V

Here is a riddle. Here is a flagrant contradiction. On the one hand, the
texts we have quoted and a large number of texts to the same effect—on
the composite nature of Man; on the chariot-like character of Man; on
the origination of consciousness, a mere sensationalism—force upon us
the conclusion that there is no Self. On the other hand, we cannot doubt
for a moment that actions are rewarded in a future life. The very text
(above [p. 43](#page_43).md) which emphasizes the mobility and the
unsubstantiality of 'what is called mind, thought, consciousness'
explains

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

that Man looks upon his mind, thought and consciousness as a Self,
because, from the beginning of ages, he is accustomed to cherish his
mind, thought and consciousness, as his Self.

This contradiction for a long time exercised the acuteness of scholars,
but it has finally been explained by a theory which has gained a fairly
general approval. This theory is summarized in the *lapidaire* sentence
of H. C. Warren: 'Rebirth, not Transmigration <span
id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md).'

There is no migration (*saṃkrama*, *saṃkrānti*), no passage of an
individual from this life to another. When a man dies, the physical
organism, which is the condition *sine qua non* of psychical life,
dissolves, and the psychical life therefore comes to an end.
Consciousness is only an "intermittent series of psychic throbs,
associated with a living organism, beating out their coming-to-know
through one brief span of life <span id="fr_26"></span>[2](#fn_26.md)."

But, on the other hand, although there is no migration, no future life
of a soul, there is rebirth, owing to the efficient force of the acts
which the dead man has accomplished and which inevitably

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

bear fruit <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md). This force originates an
'altogether' new being that is to inherit the acts of the dead man. This
being will be a god, a man, a ghost, an animal, an inhabitant of hell,
according to the nature of the acts he has inherited. In the words of A.
Barth, "The dead Buddhist does not revive, but another revives in his
stead," or, as Rhys Davids would say, there is no migration of a soul,
but there is migration of the character. A good man dies and he is dead
for ever; but his goodness does not perish, and causes another good and
happy man to be born <span id="fr_28"></span>[2](#fn_28.md).

But a consequence follows, that, if we are to accumulate merit, it is
not for our own sake, to be happy after death, but for the sake of the
heir of our acts. In the same way a miser would accumulate riches for
the sake of a distant relative. Again, if a Buddhist undergoes the
discipline that leads to Nirvāṇa—that is, the discipline owing to which
no new being is to be born in his stead—it is in order to diminish

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

by one the number of living and suffering beings.

Such a consequence is inevitable. With the exception of A. Barth, it was
or it is, more or less reluctantly, admitted by the historians of
Buddhism.

#### VI

The riddle or contradiction has been explained by the Buddhists
themselves. At the beginning, they held firmly les *deux bouts de la
chaîne*—there is no Self, there is rebirth—without troubling themselves
too much for an explanation. But they soon discovered the explanation
when they combined the two ideas that are prominent in the oldest
records of the Buddhist tradition, the idea of 'causation' and the idea
of 'transitoriness' ('momentaneity'). These two ideas are merged in the
idea of 'continuity.'

It is true that, but for action, there would not be rebirth; it is true
that the man who revives is the heir of the actions of the dead man; it
is true that the man who revives is a new being, and that, therefore,
there is no transmigration, no permanent identity (*śāśvata*): the
texts, both scriptural and scholastic, are clear to

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

that effect. But the Buddhist added, from the beginning, that there is
no annihilation, cutting off (*uccheda*), because—as it was soon
ascertained—if the being who revives is not the same as the old one, it
is not, on the other hand, different from the old one.

That seems a queer statement, but, in the words of the Brahman when
explaining intricate mysteries to his wife, "we are not to be perplexed
at this statement, it is really very simple." In any case, it is quite
Buddhist.

The problem of the non-identity of the 'new' being with the previous
one, is only a special instance of the general rule of existence.

Existence is transformation (*anyathābhāva*). What is called a being is
a complex of different constituents, a chariot: that is the static point
of view. But a being is also a series (*saṃtāna*) of successive states,
originating in dependence; a being is a fire or a plant. This point of
view, which may be styled dynamic, is to be traced in the Scriptures and
is frequently insisted on in the scholastic texts.

When milk is turned into curds, the nonidentity, the non-permanence
(*śāśvata*) is evident: curds are not milk. But, as a matter of fact,
there is no 'interruption' (*uccheda*), because there

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

has been an incessant and gradual change in milk, long before it was
curds, even when it seemed to be the same milk <span
id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md).

In the same way, Man is a living continuous complex, which does not
remain quite the same for two consecutive moments, but which continues
for an endless number of existences without becoming completely
different from itself <span id="fr_30"></span>[2](#fn_30.md).

 

If we consider a man at two different moments of his present life, it is
safe to say that he is not the same; but is it not equally evident that
he is not another?

The 'murderer' whom the executioners lead to the scaffold is not a
'murderer,' for he is not the same man who has committed murder; but he
merits punishment because he cannot be said to be another than the
murderer, being the 'continuation' of the murderer. The girl is not the
child; but she nevertheless belongs to the man to whom she has been
married when a child and who has paid the dowry. The father of the girl
has not the right of giving the girl to a new husband for a new dowry,
because the girl is the 'continuation' of the child <span
id="fr_31"></span>[3](#fn_31.md).

In the same way, the being who is to enjoy

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

the fruit of the acts of a dead man is the continuation of the dead man.

Here is a good simile <span id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32.md).

Let us imagine a jungle, bounded by a river, and a fire that is burning
this jungle. As a matter of fact we have no right to speak of a fire, as
if it were a unity. There is only a succession of flames; each of them
lasts only for a moment and dies together with the fuel it consumes at
the very place where it is born; but these flames are generated in
succession and strictly depending one upon another, although the fuel
they consume is spread over a large space. This fire, burning a jungle
bounded by a river, provides us with an exact image of the life of a man
during one existence. The physico-psychical life does not depend upon a
living principle (*jīva*) or a Self; in itself it is not a something; it
is lacking both in substance and in unity; it is only a series of
physical states and of states of consciousness generated in succession,
depending one upon another, although each of them lasts only for a
moment.

Now suppose that, owing to the strength of the wind, a fire were to
appear across the river, in another jungle, at the moment when the first

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

fire is dying on the nearer bank of the river. One cannot say that the
fire has crossed the river; one cannot say that the fire in the new
jungle is not the very fire that has burned the first jungle: in an
absolute sense, there is not one fire, there are not two fires; a fire
does not exist independently of the flames. In an absolute sense, we are
concerned with one succession of flames, and it is evident that this
succession has not been interrupted (*ucchinna*) by the river, in the
same way as it was not interrupted when it developed in the jungle
itself. The fact is that, but for the wind, this succession would have
been cut off on the nearer bank; but, owing to the strength of the wind,
a certain number of flames has been created, forming as it were a bridge
between the two banks.

That simile gives us an image of a living series extending over two or
many different existences. Owing to the strength of the wind of actions,
the ultimate state of consciousness in an existence—that is the
consciousness of the dying man, the death-consciousness (*maraṇāntika
vijñāna*)—begets or rather inaugurates a short series of states of
consciousness (coupled with a subtle organism), the last of which takes
up its abode in some matrix (*pratisaṃdhivijñāna*).

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

It is in this way that the Buddhist scholastic has solved the riddle and
understood one of the clearest statements of Śākyamuni: "If the
consciousness were not to descend into the maternal womb, the new being,
body and mind, would not arise."

 

How is therefore to be understood the Buddhist doctrine of
'selflessness'? Does it mean that there is no soul and no future life of
a soul? Certainly so, if we have in view a metaphysical entity, a soul
which is sometimes looking through the senses, as so many windows,
sometimes busied with itself, sometimes asleep; a soul which, without
being itself subject to change, is apt to take a new abode when the body
dissolves. The Buddhists do not admit any soul of this kind, for,
according to them, it would be master of its sensations and
feelings <span id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33.md); but, in its stead, they
recognize a living complex, a continuous fluid complex both bodily and
mental, a person which, in fact, possesses nearly all the characters of
a soul as we understand the word: it continues through many existences
eating the fruit of its acts; it controls itself; it makes exertions to
reach a better state; it may, when it is sublimized

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

by appropriate exertions, abandon its bodily constituents and live for
centuries in some immaterial heaven as a pure spirit.

But this person is not a substance and it is therefore capable of
dissolution. This dissolution is 'deliverance' or Nirvāṇa: the series of
the states of consciousness is interrupted at death when desire and
action have been destroyed, just as the fire dies on the nearer bank of
the river when there is no wind.

Heresy prevents the acquisition of holiness and of Nirvāṇa, but does not
prevent the acquisition of merit. A believer in the Self may be reborn
as a god and even as Brahmā. On the contrary, the denial of the reward
of actions in a future life is a sin, just as murder, theft, etc.
