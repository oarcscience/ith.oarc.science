### CHAPTER VI

### THE PATH TO NIRVĀṆA

I. The Path is the eradication of desire. II. A middle way between
asceticism and indulgence. III. A threefold training in the Buddhist
Truths. IV. A skilful practice of trances. V. Conclusion.

#### I

Nirvāṇa is the cessation of rebirth. Desire, with action consequent upon
desire, is the cause of rebirth. The path leading to deliverance from
rebirth must therefore be a path leading to deliverance from desire. In
order to avoid rebirth, it is necessary and sufficient to eradicate
desire, desire for pleasure, desire for existence, desire for
non-existence or hatred of existence; that is to become a Saint, an
Arhat, free from sorrow, hope, and fear.

On this point as on many another, we find in Brahmanism parallel
conceptions to the Buddhist doctrine. The Upaniṣads state that Man is
reborn in conformity with his desire, his aspiration, his conduct (see
above, [p. 64](w2n05.htm#page_64).md); but

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

what is the destiny of a man who is free from desire?

"When desire ceases, the mortal becomes immortal; he attains Brahman on
earth. He who is without desire, who is free from desire, who desires
only his own Self which is identical with the universal Self, he obtains
the accomplishment of his desire in the possession of his Self. He is
the universal Self and goes into the universal Self."

It is not probable that the primitive Buddhists ever heard of these
theories: the Self (*ātman*) which they know and reject is the
individual Self and they never mention the Nirvāṇa of the individual
Self in the great Self. But their doctrine of the Path may be shortly
described as a secularisation of the Upaniṣad teaching: to free oneself
from desire, while ignoring the universal Self and denying the human
Self.

On the other hand, the Buddhist path is a 'rationalisation' of a number
of practices which were common at this time among ascetics of every
faith and aspiration.

There were many 'ford-makers,' but Śākyamuni alone has discovered the
true 'ford,' or rather has re-discovered it, for the Buddhas of old had
discovered it long ago; and he has designed a

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

pattern of 'religious life' (*brahmacarya*) which is, has been, and will
be, the only means to deliverance.

To give a faithful and complete image of 'the religious life under the
rule of Buddha' would be a long affair. Every detail of the monastic
institution, every detail of the intellectual and moral training of the
monks, ought to be mentioned. Further, in order to appreciate the
historical interest of these manifold data, references ought to be made
to the rules of the contemporaneous sects and especially to the Brahman
institutions. The very word we translate 'religious life,'
*brahmacarya*, meant originally 'life of a young Brahman in the house of
his preceptor before his initiation and marriage <span
id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_73.md).'

But it will not be difficult to state the general principles of the
Buddhist Path. We have only, in the words of the Sanskrit poet, to make
a string on which to thread the jewels already pierced by others.

The Path is (1) a middle way between asceticism and laxity, (2) a
training in the Buddhist truths, (3) a skilful practice of trances or
ecstasies.

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

#### II

Laxity or indulgence means secular married life. Asceticism means, not
only, as usually with us, not indulging in morally allowed desire, but
inflicting pain, penance.

The origins of asceticism,—in Sanskrit *tapas*, a word that means
heat,—go far back into the past <span id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_74.md). In
historic India, asceticism has been turned into a religious and moral
institution—a self-torture to please the deity, to wash away the sins
one has consciously or unconsciously committed, to avoid sin by
mortifying the flesh. While assuming these new aspects, or, to put it
more uncompromisingly, while developing in a moral direction, *tapas*
remained and remains an essentially magical affair. In the ritualistic
books, it comes to the foreground of speculation as a creative power:
Prajāpati, the Lord of the generations, performed penance, became hot
and produced the worlds by the power of heat or penance. Prajāpati was a
great 'penitent'; ascetics, men who practise the most extravagant
penances, just as the modern fakirs, are penitents'

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

of a smaller size, but nevertheless demiurges in their own guise,
autonomous and irrepressible forces, frightful to the gods themselves.

The notion of holiness and wisdom was hopelessly confused with the
notion of penance: when the idea of deliverance was discovered, men
naturally thought that penitents only could have some chance of reaching
deliverance.

Accordingly when Gautama, the young prince of the Śākya race, abandoned
his home to secure his salvation, he first followed the common track and
lived for a time—for many years—as a Muni, that is as a solitary
penitent: hence his name Śākyamuni. He indulged in the most severe
abstinence from food, remaining upright and motionless, hoping for a
sudden illumination of mind. Five ascetics were his companions in these
austerities. A Greek sculptor, five or six centuries later, produced a
realistic and spiritualized representation of his emaciated body, which
is one of the masterpieces of Gandhāra art <span
id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md). But the illumination did not come, and
Śākyamuni felt very weak indeed: he understood that illumination
requires strength of mind; he took some food and soon reached the goal
for which he had long endeavoured in vain; he became

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

a Buddha. Intellectual achievements depend on intellectual efforts.

At the moment when Śākyamuni broke his fast, the five ascetics had
deserted him, and when Śākyamuni after becoming a Buddha approached them
again, they jeered saying: "Here is the one that failed in his
austerities." Śākyamuni told them that he had obtained complete
enlightenment. "But," they asked, "if you could not succeed in obtaining
enlightenment by asceticism, how can we admit that you have succeeded
when you live in abundance, when you have given up exertion?" To which
Śākyamuni replied that he had not given up exertion—for penance is not
the only exertion—and that his life was not a life of abundance; for the
path of the men 'who have given up the world' to obtain deliverance is a
middle path between the two extremes, asceticism and indulgence. "What
are the two extremes? A life addicted to sensual pleasures: this is
base, sensual, vulgar, ignoble, pernicious; and a life addicted to
mortification: this is painful, ignoble and pernicious <span
id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_76.md)."

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

While many ascetics, the Jains for instance, regarded penance as the
chief element of spiritual progress <span id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_77.md),
Śākyamuni depreciates and even, in some cases, forbids penance. (1) If
penance is practised in order to obtain worldly advantages, rebirth in
heaven or magical powers, the divine eye, etc., it is a purely mundane
affair; born from desire, it produces desire, and is far from leading to
salvation. (2) As concerns salvation, penance by itself is of no avail.
To hold the contrary is 'heresy,' technically the *śīlavrataparāmarśa*,
'believing in the efficiency of rites and ascetic practices.'

Śākyamuni does not condemn every penance, far from that. But he thinks
that, even when practised by the 'orthodox,' penance presents many
drawbacks.

One of them is that it is likely to beget spiritual pride, one of the
pitfalls of the monks:

"Whosoever is pure and knows that he is pure, and finds pleasure in
knowing that he is pure, becomes impure and dies with an impure thought.
Whosoever is impure and knows that he is impure, and makes effort to
become pure, dies with a pure thought."

Again some penances—abstinence from food,

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

for instance, not to mention mutilations—are injurious to body and
therefore to mind. Now full strength of mind is necessary to the
understanding of the philosophical truths that are really to purify the
thought. The body, therefore, must be treated without hatred if without
love; the monks have to take care of their body, but it is unjust to say
that they love it. As Nāgasena told the king Milinda <span
id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_78.md):

"Have you ever at any time been hit in battle by an arrow? "—"Yes, I
have."—"And was the wound anointed with ointment, smeared with oil and
bandaged with a strip of fine cloth?"—"Yes, it was."—"Did you love your
wound?"—"No."—"In exactly the same way, the ascetics do not love their
bodies; but, without being attached to them, they take care of their
bodies in order to advance in the religious life."

But, if the body is not to be crushed, the desires of the body are to be
crushed. Śākyamuni condemns every indulgence; the smallest concession
may be disastrous; desire is everywhere, for we are living desire <span
id="fr_79"></span>[2](#fn_79.md):

All things, O monks, are on fire. The eye is on fire, visible forms are
on fire, visual cognitions are on fire, impressions received by the eye
are on fire, and whatever sensations, pleasant, unpleasant or
indifferent, originate in dependence on impressions received by the

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

eye, these also are on fire. And with what are these on fire? With the
fire of lust, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of infatuation.

Ear and sounds, nose and smells, tongue and taste, body—that is the
organ of touch—and tangible qualities, mind and ideas are also on fire.

The right means to extinguish this fire is not the surgical
method—neither vow of silence, in order to avoid sins and desires of the
voice: for if that be the case, mute animals would be Saints; nor
absence of thought; nor craziness, real or simulated folly
(*unmattaka*), nor other stupid and stupefying devices, such as living
as a cow or a dog, nor mutilations and self-torture, nor suicide, this
*ultima ratio* of the Jain ascetics. Suicide is clearly an action
commanded by desire or by disgust: one commits suicide to be better
elsewhere or to avoid pain <span id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_80.md). The
Buddhist must wait his time, without longing for life, without longing
for death.

The right means to extinguish the fire is the intellectual method which
we shall outline presently, coupled with a moderate asceticism.

1\. There were, in the primitive Brotherhood, men of penitential
tendencies,—former adherents of penitential orders, for instance
Mahākāśyapa

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

and his followers, who had realized the superiority of Śākyamuni's
teaching, who had recognized in Śākyamuni the Omniscient One and the
leader of spiritual life. Śākyamuni did not provide for them a new rule:
he condemned the most morbid exaggerations of asceticism and the
indecent practices, nakedness and so on; but he permitted a number of
mortifications (*dhūtaguṇa*) which were not in themselves objectionable.

The 'hermits' (*āraṇyaka*), the 'men of cemeteries' (*śmāśānika*) form,
throughout the history of the church, a special class of monks,
dangerously like the non-Buddhist ascetics. They were holy men,
ecstatics and poets <span id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_81.md), but in some
respects they were 'heretics' as well <span
id="fr_82"></span>[2](#fn_82.md).

2\. The conception of the truly Buddhist religious life is to be found
in the Vinaya which contains the rules established by Śākyamuni and the
first generation of Elders for the monks and the nuns of common
observance. The more we study the Vinaya <span
id="fr_83"></span>[3](#fn_83.md), the more we wonder at the common sense
that is visible in the general principles and in many details.

The monks of common observance have been

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

by far the most numerous and the most important in the history of
Buddhism. Absolute continence, no private property; a very strict régime
which affords little or no scope for concupiscence or for individual
fancy, which seems very favourable to moral mortification while avoiding
any corporeal pain; the life of a wandering mendicant during the dry
season, and, during rains, a cenobitic life with all the mutual
concessions and admonitions this life implies. On the whole an
aristocratic form of asceticism, very much resembling the asceticism of
the Brahmans.

 

But Brahmans and Buddhists diverge on one point which is very
important <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_84.md).

The Brahmans are strong on the *mos majorum*. They say: "Win only the
knowledge of the Self and leave alone everything else <span
id="fr_85"></span>[2](#fn_85.md)"; but they nevertheless continue to
sacrifice to the gods, because the gods exist κατὰ δόξαν. They believe
that every sensible man has to try to obtain eternal deliverance, and
that a meditative, semi-penitential life is necessary in order to reach
this lofty aim. But they cannot admit that it

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

can be right to forsake the duties of caste; and, like their Āryan
ancestors, they cling to the theory of the four debts. Man pays his debt
to the gods by sacrifice, to the Veda by study, to the dead by the birth
of a son, to men by hospitality. When he has paid this fourfold debt,
then only may the Brahman abandon everything and take up his abode in
the forest in order to meditate, to save himself, to die as a holy man.

As usual, the Brahmanic point of view is forcibly expressed in the
Mahābhārata. We are told that an anchorite, who had 'left the world'
before marrying, came to a terrible place, which was in fact the pit of
hell. There he recognized his father, his grandfather, the long series
of all his ancestors, suspended one below another on the open mouth of
the abyss. The rope which prevented them from falling was slowly and
surely being gnawed by a mouse, a figure of Time. And so many voices,
some well known, reminding him of accents heard when a child, some
unknown yet appealing to a profound and hidden instinct, so many voices
cried: "Save us! save us!" The only hope of welfare for the long series
of the ancestors is the son to be born of their descendant. The
anchorite understood the lesson, married, and was able to save himself
without remorse, having saved his ancestors. (See *Paramatthajotikā*,
ii, i, p. 317.)

The Buddhists are more consistent. Laymen, however faithful, generous
and virtuous they may be, even if they practise the fortnightly
abstinence and continence of the Upavāsa,

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

cannot reach Nirvāṇa. The only Buddhist, in the proper meaning of the
word, is the monk who has broken all the ties of society; and the sooner
one becomes a monk, the better. Why delay in getting rid of occasions of
greed and of carnal desire? Therefore children are admitted, not to
religious vows, but to the apprenticeship of the vows, when they are
seven years old and big enough to drive away the rooks.

If by chance, and despite the theory, a layman obtains Sanctity, he is
miraculously turned into a monk; he suddenly appears shaved, garbed in
the yellow robe, alms bowl in hand, like, in all his demeanour, to a
monk who has fifty years of profession.

### III

The moderate asceticism <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86.md) we have
described is not, to speak exactly, a part of the Path leading to the
eradication of desire; it is rather only a preparation to the Path:
getting away from the occasions of desire. The Path is essentially a
training in the Buddhist truths.

Desire depends on the organs of sense and the exterior objects. Whereas
we are not allowed to destroy the organs, since suicide, mutilations,

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

fasting are objectionable, the pleasant exterior objects are too many to
be suppressed. In the same way, it is impossible to avoid every occasion
of anger; solitary life does not realize perfect loneliness; suffering,
disgust and anger follow the monk even in the 'empty room' (*śūnyāgāra*)
where he sits to meditate.

It is said <span id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_87.md):

There is not leather enough to cover the surface of the earth in order
to make it smooth. But put on shoes, and the whole earth will be smooth.

In order—not to avoid lust (*rāga*) and anger or disgust (*dveṣa*), a
mere palliative—but to eradicate them, the only method is to cure one's
self, to eradicate the delusion (*moha*) that originates lust and anger.
We exert no mastery over Nature or over the body, but we can master our
own mind and destroy the four mistakes (*viparyāsa*): looking at what
really is unpleasant, impure, transitory, and unsubstantial, as if it
were pleasant, pure, permanent, and substantial. We must learn to see
things as they really are; technically, we must possess the Four Truths:
every existence is a state of suffering or turns to suffering; existence
originates in desire; cessation of rebirth—Nirvāṇa—is perfect bliss; the
way

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

thither is cessation of desire. First and last, we must realize the true
nature of this intricate, deceiving, and most dear compound that men
style ‘I.’

The possession of the Truths brings about a complete renovation of the
mind <span id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_88.md). Desire cannot germinate in a
mind which is enlightened by true wisdom, as a plant cannot germinate in
salt. The agreeable and the disagreeable exist only because we believe
them to be lovable or hateful: they are creations of the mind. Pain
disappears as soon as we cease thinking ‘I.’ and ‘mine.’ It is said:

In the same way as a man resents the bad conduct of his wife while he
still loves her, and no longer; even so the pain of the body is no
longer resented when a man ceases to consider the body his own.

 

The possession of the Truths depends on three conditions, Faith
(*śraddhā*), Sight (*darśana*), Cultivation (*bhāvanā*).

1\. Śākyamuni alone has discovered the Truths; there is no hope of
salvation for a man who does not take refuge in the Buddha and in the
Truths revealed by him <span id="fr_89"></span>[2](#fn_89.md).

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

In some cases, it is possible to ascertain that the Buddha's word is
trustworthy; in others, one must say: "I admit that because I believe in
Buddha's word"; "Buddha knows and I do not know." The general principle
is as follows <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90.md): "One must meditate on
and understand the points of doctrine that are intelligible to an
ordinary man. For the others, one must willingly admit them, saying:
That belongs to Buddha's domain of vision." It is said <span
id="fr_91"></span>[2](#fn_91.md):

When Buddha, this lion of men, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies,
if anybody ventures to say that Buddha does not possess superhuman
virtues, that he does not know the absolute truth, that his teaching is
made up of dialectic, is accompanied by research, experience, individual
intuition,—if a man ventures to think or to speak in this way and does
not regret his thought or his word, he will be precipitated into hell.

2\. But faith is not sufficient. Truths accepted on the authority of
others do not really belong to us; they remain, as it were, extraneous
and precarious possessions; they are not turned into our flesh and
blood, *en sang et nourriture*. The Buddhist truths are to be understood
and realized; the Saint is the man who has become,

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

like Śākyamuni himself, but under the guidance of Śākyamuni, an
'enlightened' one.

Texts which recommend or rather enjoin personal inquiry and criticism
compare in strength and number with the texts which praise faith.
Śākyamuni does not demand a blind adhesion; he does not, as a rule,
perform miracles to convert his opponent. The real miracle is the
'miracle of the teaching.' Śākyamuni's teaching is 'accompanied by
proofs'; "it must not be accepted out of respect; on the contrary, it
must be criticized, as gold is proved in the fire <span
id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92.md)."

Now, O monks, are you going to say: We respect the Master and out of
respect for the Master, we believe this and that?—We will not say so.—Is
not what you will say to be true, that exactly which you have by
yourselves seen, known, apprehended?—Exactly so <span
id="fr_93"></span>[2](#fn_93.md).

This point, as many another, has been very well illustrated by
Oldenberg. Buddhas do not liberate their fellow creatures. A Buddha is
only a preacher, and he teaches men how to liberate themselves.
Disciples accept his preaching, not only because it comes from a man who
is visibly a saint, a *vītarāga*, that is 'a man free from passion,' and
who therefore, according to the

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Indian opinion, is
likely to be omniscient (*sarvajña*)—but because his preaching proves
accurate, because, as says Oldenberg, "aroused by his word, a personal
knowledge arises in their mind <span id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_94.md)."

Pascal says the same thing and he points out the deep reason of the
prestige of the great spiritual leaders:

On trouve dans soi-même la vérité de ce qu’on entend, laquelle on ne
savait pas qu’elle y fût, en sorte qu’on est porté à aimer celui qui
nous le fait sentir.

Buddhists are introduced into the realm of truth by Faith; they possess
truth only by Sight. They walk by sight and not by faith.

It may be remarked that the position of the Brahman philosopher towards
the Veda—more exactly, towards the Vedānta, the Upaniṣads—is almost the
same. No human being would have discovered the great axiom of the
Upaniṣads of the identity of the Self with the universal Self; but the
truth of this axiom, once by faith it has been admitted, is proved
beyond doubt by personal intuition.

3\. Sight must be followed by *bhāvanā*, that is cultivation, exercise,
meditation; pondering again and again, impressing.

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

As far as we can see, Cultivation does not bring an increase of
knowledge, a more accurate or more extended intelligence of
unpleasantness, impurity, impermanence, unreality. But it confers a
firmer knowledge which enables the ascetic to look always at things as
they are, without being ever deceived by their apparent pleasantness,
purity, permanence, reality.

To be accurate and technical, *darśana* destroys six of the ten passions
or errors (*anuśaya*) and turns an 'ordinary' man (*pṛthagjana*) into a
'converted' man (*srotaāpanna*); *bhāvanā* destroys the four remaining
*anuśayas* (*pratigha*, *rāga*, *māna*, *avidyā*) in so far as they are
concerned with Kāmadhātu, and turns the *srotaāpanna* first into a
*sakṛdāgāmin* (by the destruction of the first six degrees of these
*anuśayas*), then into an *anāgāmin* (by the destruction of the
remaining three degrees); *bhāvanā* again destroys *rāga*, *māna* and
*avidyā* which are concerned with the Rūpadhātu and the Ārūpyadhātu, and
turns the *anāgāmin* into an Arhat. There is no *pratigha* above the
Kāmadhātu.

One of the simplest and most important of the 'meditations' is the
'meditation on loathsomeness' (*aśubhabhāvanā*). We should like to
describe it shortly, not to bring disgrace on Buddhism, but in order to
give a more exact idea of the so-called 'spiritual training,' in order
to portray more faithfully the physiognomy of the ascetic. There are in
Buddhism so many

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

lofty feelings, and also so modern an effort towards 'rationalism,' that
the student—the compiler as well as the reader of a Manual—is likely to
forget its Hindu features.

Visits to cemeteries, where unburied bodies are left to decay, are a
duty of a monk, and there are in the Buddhist brotherhood ascetics who
choose to live in cemeteries—the *śmāśānikas*, men of the cemeteries—in
order to meditate uninterruptedly on the impermanence and the impurity
of the body. The meditation takes on rather physical and emotional
characters <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95.md).

Ten 'cemeteries,' that is ten aspects of the dead body, are to be
realized in turn,—to begin with the body one day dead, or two days or
three days dead, swollen, black—to continue with an older corpse eaten
by crows, with the corpse which has become 'this I know not what,
something that has no name in any language,' but which the Buddhists are
fond of describing at great length—to end with the bones rotting and
crumbling into dust, as they have been washed by the rains of years.

The monk, for days and months, lives with the idea: "Verily, my body
also has this nature, this destiny, and is not exempt."

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

Such is one of the forms of the meditation on loathsomeness. When it has
been practised long enough, it is not enough to say that the beauty and
the form of a woman have lost their natural attractiveness: they are no
longer perceived. The ascetic sees the skeleton only and the forthcoming
putrefaction.

 

Despite its 'romantic' adjuncts, *bhāvanā* is an intellectual affair,
the third degree of the realization of a truth.

To be taught impermanence, to be told that "Life ends in death" is one
thing. Young men, 'infatuated by the pride of youth,' may agree to this
statement: "Life ends in death," but they do not understand its true
import. That is Faith, adhesion to the word of the Master. To ascertain
this statement by personal inquiry, is what is called Sight. Finally, to
ponder over it, until it becomes not only familiar, but actually always
present to the mind, that is Cultivation.

#### IV

The path to deliverance would have been very reasonable—we mean, would
be thoroughly intelligible to us—if the Buddhists had been satisfied

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

with the realization of the Truths, positive statements to be believed,
'seen' or understood, 'cultivated' or pondered over; but the words Sight
and Cultivation, explained as above, do not convey the true import of
the Buddhist *darśana* and *bhāvanā*. A factor, a practically almost
necessary factor of *darśana* and *bhāvanā*, is what is called
concentration (*samādhi*), trance (*dhyāna*), attainment (*samāpatti*)—a
non-intellectual element.

 

The history of trance is a long and obscure one. Trance has been traced
in the semi-civilized civilisations. Just as penance is a common
practice among the medicine-men, the sorcerers of old, even so trance is
an archaic device. It was admitted that Man obtains, in semi-hypnotic
states, a magical power. The name of a thing is supposed to be either
the thing itself or a sort of double of the thing: to master, during
trance, the name, is to master the thing.

Just as penance, trance became a means to spiritual aims.

That is the case with Brahmanism. Trance is the necessary path to the
merging of the individual Self into the universal Self. To speak more
accurately, there is only one Self, which

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

is immanent in Man. For a time, the knowledge of our essential identity
with this Self was looked upon as sufficient. But the actual feeling of
identity was soon considered as necessary. Such feeling is impossible in
ordinary consciousness; therefore it must be realized in trances,
trances to be induced by hypnotic devices, the same as were practised by
the sorcerers, protracted rigidity of body, fixity of look, mental
repetition of strange sets of formulae, suppression of breath. Further,
the immanence of the Self is a very materialistic one: it has its seat
in the heart, where it is felt stirring and from which it directs the
animal spirits; it makes its way along the arteries. . . Psycho-physical
exercises are necessary to concentrate all the vital energies in the
heart, that is to withdraw the Self from the not Self <span
id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_96.md). Hence the intricate discipline known as
*Yoga*, with trance as an essential element.

 

It is only fair to state that the position of trance is, in Buddhism, a
quite different one. Trance, like asceticism, is not an essential part
of the Path, even if it were admitted that it is practically necessary,
*d’une nécessité de moyen*, to use a phrase of the Catechism.

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

Buddhism teaches in so many words that not every trance is good. A
trance which is not aimed at the right end, eradication of desire, is a
mundane (*laukika*) affair. When undertaken with desire, in order to
obtain either advantages in this life, namely magical powers, or some
special kind of rebirth, trances cannot confer any spiritual advantage.
Of course, if they are correctly managed, they succeed, as any other
human contrivance would succeed: a monk or any man who devotes himself
to the concentration called 'of the realm of the infinity of space,' in
order to live for centuries in the realm of the 'gods meditating on the
infinity of space,' will be reborn in this realm, provided he has not to
pay some old debts in hell or elsewhere; he will live there for
centuries, as he hoped for; but he will die there some day and continue
migrating.

But, on the other hand, it is an ascertained fact that Śākyamuni
obtained 'enlightenment' by the practice of trances, and accordingly
every monk has to practise trances if he is to make any progress. The
more Buddhism discourages 'mundane' trance, the more it extols
'supramundane' (*lokottara*) trance, that is trance entered into, in
order to cut off desire, by a monk who endeavours to get possession of
the

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Truths. The
intention of the ascetic and his moral preparation make all the
difference between mundane and supramundane trance.

Our texts clearly state that several of the Buddhist trances were
practised by non-Buddhists, and scholars agree that the Buddhists did
actually borrow from the common store of mystical devices.

 

The actual aim of trance seems to be, in Buddhism, twofold: to
strengthen the mind, to empty the mind.

1\. By means of trance, the ascetic concentrates the mind, strengthens
the power of attention, gets rid of distraction. There are many
technical contrivances, among which the ten *kṛtsnāyatanas* which seem
to deserve special notice <span id="fr_97"></span>[1](#fn_97.md).

The monk makes a disk of light red clay—such as is found in the bed of
the Ganges—one span four inches in diameter. He sits at a distance of
two and a half cubits from the disk, on a seat of a height fixed by
rule: if he were to sit further off, the disk would not appear plainly;
if nearer, the imperfections of the disk would be visible; if too high,
he would have to bend his neck to look; if too low, his knees would
ache. Then the meditation begins: the ecstatic has to look at the disk
as long as it is necessary in order to see

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

it with closed eyes, that is in order to create a mental image of the
disk. To realize this aim, he must contemplate the disk sometimes with
his eyes open, sometimes with his eyes shut, and thus for a hundred
times, or for a thousand times, or even more, until the mental image is
secured. All the time he conceives indifference for sensual pleasure; he
reflects on the qualities of Buddha; he affirms his confidence in the
efficacy of the exercise he is performing.

2\. Trances may be defined as efforts towards an actual simplification
or emptying of thought; as endeavours to get directly rid of the very
ideas of I, mine, being, non-being <span id="fr_98"></span>[1](#fn_98.md).
As it is said:

When being and not being no longer stand before the mind, then thought
is definitely appeased.

The method is not a view, either discursive or immediate, of
impermanence or unsubstantiality, but a mechanical process.

The mind, once concentrated (*samāhita*) and strengthened by exercise
with the clay disk or any other exercise of the same kind, is
successively to abandon its contents and its categories. The ecstatic
starts from a state of contemplation coupled with reasoning and
reflection; he abandons desire, sin, distractions, discursiveness, joy,
hedonic feeling; he goes beyond any notion of matter, of contact, of
difference; through the

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

meditation of void space, of knowledge without object, of nothingness,
he passes into the stage where there is neither consciousness nor
unconsciousness and finally he realizes the actual disappearance of
feeling and notion.

It is a lull in the psychical life which coincides with perfect
hypnosis.

At a moment which has been previously determined—modern physicians
explain how this is possible—the ecstatic comes back, through the same
successive steps, to the world of the living.

Does he come back in exactly the same condition as he was before? Can he
practise these 'spiritual' attainments again and again, every afternoon
after he has taken his only meal, sitting in an empty room or under the
shadow of a tree, without being psychologically and corporeally
affected?

The Buddhists believe that the mind remains, as it were, perfumed by the
trances. For some hours or for seven days, sensation and cognition have
been completely stopped. The ideas of I, mine, being, not-being are
likely to present themselves again—as a matter of fact, they present
themselves again as soon as mental life begins afresh—but they have lost
their inherited

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

power of arousing desire; they have been 'attenuated': "The mind of a
monk who has risen from the trance of the cessation of feeling and
notion is inclined to isolation, has a tendency to isolation, is
impelled to isolation." Thus says Śākyamuni.

We willingly agree. The professional ecstatic is likely to forget how to
see exterior objects: the mental reflexes he has cultivated turn to be
more real than the changing appearances; in the same way, the ecstatic
hears mysterious sounds. He becomes inaccessible to the desires that are
born from the senses, inaccessible to pain, for his nervous sensibility
is almost destroyed; he is happy; he is a Saint; he will not be reborn,
because he has introduced into the series of his thoughts such a number
of blank spaces that the further generation of thought and desire is
stopped.

#### V

There are many aspects of Buddhism, which are more attractive than the
aspect we have been studying. Apart from the religious developments
known as Mahāyāna, older Buddhism owes the popularity which it has
enjoyed in

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> India and which it
enjoys in the West, not to its intricate theories on the soul or on the
Path, but to its moral features, to the charming, if enigmatic,
personality of the Master, to the mild wisdom of its gnomic poetry, to
the legendary literature (Birth Stories) which contains so much
folklore, humanity and wit. In fact, we have been busied with the most
abstruse side of Buddhism, and, by no means, with the most important
from the historical standpoint. But, from the philosophical standpoint,
it is useful to make out clearly the reasons why this old query "Is
Buddhism, since it is atheist, a religion?" is not a real problem. An
inadequate knowledge of the nature of Indian mysticism and of the
twofold nature of Buddhism is responsible for the confusion that is
implied in such a view. Secondly, Buddhists have been credited with
opinions concerning Soul and Nirvāṇa, which are by no means correct. I
venture to think that it is worth while to consider anew these important
and controverted points, and that, while the last word will never be
said, our endeavours towards a more truly Buddhistic interpretation have
not been utterly vain. My late friend Cecil Bendall willingly confessed
that the only means to a right understanding of a

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

religion is to believe in this religion. I am not prepared to say that I
am a Buddhist, and moreover it is too late to take the *pabbajjā* under
Sāriputta; but I have spared no pains to think and to feel as did the
'yellow-robed monks' who have rendered so eminent services, not to
mankind as a whole, but to India, to China, to the Far East.
