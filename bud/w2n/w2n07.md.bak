#### I

Older Buddhism, more accurately the Buddhism of the old Books, is almost
exclusively a discipline of deliverance, deliverance from rebirth and
death, deliverance from transmigration. Like the other disciplines of
deliverance, the doctrine of the Upaniṣads or the Sāṃkhya, it is founded
on pessimism.

Indian or Buddhist pessimism is often looked upon as a natural
consequence of the belief in transmigration. Much has been written on
this subject—sometimes perhaps 'unintelligently,' as E. J. Thomas rather
strongly asserts <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md). India

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

as a whole has never been, as it were, hallucinated by the idea of
rebirth and death. Common religious people dreamt of paradises, of
eternal paradises; and there has been, from the beginning, side by side
with the Buddhist discipline of salvation, a Buddhist religion, a
moralized Hinduism. The doctrine of transmigration itself opens out
cheerful possibilities: rebirth does not necessarily mean rebirth as a
creature of hell, as an animal, a ghost, a miserable man. The
Śatapathabrāhmaṇa expressly states that rebirth in this world is a
reward. The so-called 'bad states' (*durgati*) are not without their own
satisfactions: to be a serpent or a ghost 'endowed with a great magical
power' is after all not despicable. But the most striking evidence that
transmigration did not frighten the Buddhist monks is that they have
built a number of heavens, fit for any temperament: enjoyable and
meditative heavens. They know, better than the Brahmans themselves do,
the path that leads to the heaven of Brahmā! In a word, Transmigration
is death again and again, but it is also inexhaustible life.

But there were in the days of Śākyamuni many men to whom the very idea
of death proved intolerable. Why, owing to what climatic,

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

racial, social circumstances it is so, is and will remain a mystery. But
the fact is beyond doubt, and it is well illustrated by the importance
given, in the old Buddhist Literature, to this simple statement, which
looks like a great discovery: "Life indeed ends in death <span
id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59.md)."

Śākyamuni teaches that the ocean is not large and deep enough to contain
the tears which through millions of existences fill the eyes of one man;
he comforts a mother who had just burnt on the funeral pyre her daughter
ironically named Jīvā, Life, by telling her that she had already burnt,
thousands of times, in the same burning place, the same daughter.

There is no happiness in life:

Then I asked them: "Can you maintain that you yourselves for a whole
night, or for a whole day, or even for half a night or day, have been
perfectly happy?" And they answered "No."

Buddhists go so far as to deny that *suṣupti*, the profound sleep
praised in the Upaniṣads, is free from suffering; they would refuse to
the Great King the few hours of rest which the Socrates of the Apologia
is willing to concede to him.

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

Then I said to them: "Do you know a way, or a method, by which you can
realize a state that is altogether happy?" And still to that question,
they answered "No <span id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_60.md)."

In a word, there were many, men and women, old and young, noblemen and
outcasts, merchants and robbers, who had learnt to despise the trivial
joys of existence, who wished for absolute happiness and despaired of
reaching it. Deliverance from rebirth seemed to them a goal for which it
was worth while to strive.

 

Deliverance, or Nirvāṇa, is the central idea of the teaching of
Śākyamuni and the *raison d’ētre* of the religious life:

"As the vast ocean, O monks, is impregnated with one flavour, the
flavour of salt, so also, O monks, this my Law and Discipline is
impregnated with but one flavour, with the flavour of deliverance <span
id="fr_61"></span>[2](#fn_61.md)."

 

It seems therefore that we should be amply provided with definitions of
Nirvāṇa and that there should be no doubt as to the actual meaning of
this word.

As a matter of fact, we know what Nirvāṇa

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

is as well as the Buddhists themselves, and it is not our fault if we
are not able to give an unambiguous statement. The Buddhists were
satisfied with descriptions which do not satisfy us.

On the one hand, whereas we have been for centuries trained to make our
ideas clear, this was not the case with Indians. The historian has not
to deal with Latin notions worked out by sober and clear-sighted
thinkers, but with Indian 'philosophumena' concocted by the ascetics
whom we shall describe presently: men exhausted by a severe diet and
often stupefied by the practice of ecstasy. Indians do not make a clear
distinction between facts and ideas, between ideas and words; they have
never clearly recognized the principle of contradiction.

Buddhist dialectic has a four-branched dilemma: Nirvāṇa is existence, or
non-existence, or both existence and non-existence, or neither existence
nor non-existence. We are helpless.

We are prepared to admit that there may be degrees in 'being,' pleroma
and kenosis. But our logical categories are not numerous enough for a
theory of degrees in 'voidness' or nonexistence as Mātṛceṭa states it:

Others than Buddha have won the same liberation or Nirvāṇa, but in
Buddha the superiority is altogether

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

great. All the liberated are void, but this leaves room for the
superiority of Buddha: the void of a pore of the skin compares but
poorly with the large void of the sky <span
id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62.md).

Moreover, we look at the Buddhist doctrines from the outside. Whereas
Nirvāṇa is for us—*pace* the neo-Buddhists—a mere object of
archæological interest, it is for Buddhists of paramount practical
importance. Our task is to study what Nirvāṇa may be; the task of a
Buddhist is to reach Nirvāṇa.

Comparisons are misleading; but the *Imitatio Christi* may be quoted:
"What avails the understanding of the holy Trinity, if we displease the
Trinity?" We have to please God, not to realize the nature of God.
Rather in the same way, Śākyamuni prohibited discussion concerning
Nirvāṇa. For a Buddhist, the important thing is, not to know what
Nirvāṇa is, but to reach Nirvāṇa; and inquiry concerning Nirvāṇa may
prove disastrous. As historical students, our only danger is to make
mistakes, and we can afford it.

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

#### II

The primitive meaning of this celebrated word, Nirvāṇa, seems to be
twofold: on the one hand, 'becoming cool, cooling'; on the other hand,
'blowing out,' 'extinguishing.' There is a *nirvāṇa* of a man who is
thirsty as well as of a candle <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md).

Hence two directions in the evolution of the religious or philosophical
meaning of the word. Cooling, refreshment, the refreshment of a man who
is suffering, the cooling of a man who is hot with desire, comfort,
peace, serenity, bliss. Also extinction, detachment or extinction of the
fire of the passions, negative bliss or extinction of suffering,
annihilation or extinction of individual existence.

Each metaphor is apt to convey two distinct ideas.

On the one hand, Nirvāṇa is Sanctity (*arhattva*). For a Saint (*arhat*)
has become cold (*śītībhūta*), as he is no more burned by the fire of
passions, and he has extinguished this fire.

On the other hand, Nirvāṇa is the ultimate end of a man, the state of a
Saint after death.

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> For Nirvāṇa may be
cooling of suffering—an eternal refreshment—or extinction of existence.

In the Pāli literature, it is not always evident whether the word
Nirvāṇa (*nibbāna*), with its numerous synonyms, means Sanctity, the
state of a living Saint, or the state of a Saint after death. The first
meaning is the more common. On the other hand, in the Sanskrit
literature of Buddhism, Nirvāṇa generally means the state of a Saint
after death. We will use the word Nirvāṇa in this last meaning and style
Sanctity the state of a living Saint.

 

Two points are beyond doubt:

1\. Nirvāṇa is the *summum bonum*.

2\. Nirvāṇa belongs to Saints and to Saints alone.

Let us consider the death of an ordinary man and the death of a Saint.
Men who at death are endowed with desire and who have not destroyed
their ancient Karman, have to be reborn according to their merit and
demerit. They continue transmigrating. A Saint has not to be reborn; he
has passed beyond birth, old age and death; in the technical phrase: "He
has destroyed rebirth; he has led the religious

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

life; he has done what he had to do; he has nothing more to do with life
here <span id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64.md)."

So much is certain.

But it can be maintained either (1) that the dead Saint is annihilated,
cut off, does not exist any longer; or (2) that he has reached an
immortal state; or (3) that we can only assert, without being able to
state positively what deliverance is, that he is delivered from
transmigration.

In other words, Nirvāṇa is either annihilation, or immortality, or
'unqualified deliverance,' a deliverance of which we have no right to
predicate anything.

It is fairly certain that, from the beginning, there have been Buddhists
who held one of these three opinions. The point is to realize the
relative importance of these conflicting views, and to state which is
the prevailing teaching of the Scriptures and the ruling idea of the
Buddhist religious life.

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

#### III

That Nirvāṇa is annihilation results—at least for us—both from the
general principles of Buddhist philosophy and from clear statements.

There is nothing permanent in Man. Man is a complex of bodily and
spiritual constituents which form a physico-psychical organism. In the
case of men who are not Saints, this organism is not cut off at death
when the body perishes, because, owing to desire and to Karman, it is
continued in a new organism, heir of the first. Now suppose that—as is
the case of a dying Saint—desire is destroyed and Karman to be
experienced (*vedanīya*) absent, there is no cause for rebirth. There
will not be a new complex of bodily and spiritual constituents to be
reborn when a Saint dies. And there is no existence possible outside
these constituents: the Buddhist criticism has sedulously destroyed all
the mystical or psychological data—idea of a transcendent soul
(Sāṃkhya), idea of an immanent absolute (Upaniṣads, Vedānta)—that could
give any support to a conception of survival of whatever kind.
Selflessness precludes all possibility of survival.

Moreover it is certain that the Buddhists—I mean the Buddhists who
compiled the Scriptures

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> —were well aware
of this consequence of the dogma of Selflessness. When the question is
discussed of the survival of the Saint, the answer is often—often, not
always—in the terms we have just stated: "Any matter or body (*rūpa*)
which could be said to be the matter or the body of the Saint no longer
exists," and so on with the immaterial (*arūpin*) constituents of the
human organism: "Any cognition whatever which could be said to be a
cognition of the Saint no longer exists." Elsewhere: "Henceforth, when I
shall be asked whether a Saint perishes at death or not, I shall answer:
Body is perishable <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65.md)."

It cannot be said that there is a chariot where there is neither pole,
nor axle, nor any of the constituent parts of the chariot. In the same
way, there is no Saint where there are not the elements which constitute
this pseudo-individuality called a Saint <span
id="fr_66"></span>[2](#fn_66.md).

 

It may therefore be safely maintained that Nirvāṇa is annihilation.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

Does that imply that Buddhists aim at annihilation? Not exactly so.
Scholars who have maintained that Nirvāṇa was chiefly looked upon as
annihilation do not say that a monk leads the religious life in order to
be annihilated at death, but that he leads the religious life in order
to become a Saint. Sanctity is the goal. Sanctity is the *summum bonum*,
deliverance, Nirvāṇa.

In the words of Rhys Davids <span id="fr_67"></span>[1](#fn_67.md), the
deliverance Śākyamuni preaches is "a salvation from the sorrows of life,
which has to be reached here on earth in a changed state of mind." The
hope of a monk is to obtain "a lasting state of happiness and peace to
be reached here on earth by the extinction of the fire of lust, hatred
and delusion." 'A lasting state of happiness. . .' from the moment when
Sanctity is attained to the hour of death. Buddhism would thus be only a
discipline of happy life here below.

 

Our opinion is that these statements are very wide of the mark. But it
is only fair to admit that much may be said in their favour and that
they are to some extent exact. We must honestly admit that
Sanctity—coupled with annihilation

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> —may have been and
has been, for many a monk, the ruling motive of the religious life.

According to the philosophical tenets of Buddhism—strictly understood—on
the one hand, transmigration is pain; on the other hand, the Saint, at
death, does not exist any longer. The life after death having lost any
interest for the Buddhist, he had only to work out a supreme ideal of
happiness in this very life. That he did. It is a professional
happiness. The monks, technicians of Sanctity—that is, absolute
detachment, mental and moral apathy—were apt to make Sanctity the chief
point of a discipline of their own. *Ils n’étaient pas Hindous pour
rien*.

India has always been full of awe and admiration for the ascetics and
ecstatics who have reached a thorough tranquillity, a perfect ἀταραξία,
insensible to pleasure and to pain and therefore altogether happy. Such
men were a natural product of the Indian soil. They have been the
pattern of Brahman and Buddhist Sanctity.

The Brahmans have worked out a metaphysical interpretation of the
ecstatic Saint. They style him a *jīvanmukta*, 'delivered yet living,'
and assert that he is actually identified with Brahman, that is to say
with the immanent Absolute.

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

The Buddhists have as a starting point the same type of Saint; but they
do not attempt any metaphysical interpretation. They are satisfied with
a study of the psychological ascertained facts. To put it shortly, the
Buddhist Saint is plunged in the concentration 'where notion and feeling
are destroyed.'

While dwelling in concentration, the Saint is happy. When he, sometimes,
opens his eyes to the spectacle of the world, he is also happy. He
contemplates from the shores of the island of serenity the painful
agitations of men: he is free, they are fettered by desire. He enjoys
one of the most delicate pleasures in this life, the pleasure of
self-complacence coupled with altruism. He says, in the style of the
Lucretian sage:

The wise, climbing the terraced heights of wisdom looks down upon the
fools; serene he looks upon the toiling crowd, as one who stands on a
mountain looks down upon those that stand upon the plain <span
id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_68.md).

A sublime pattern of this serene happiness was afforded by Śākyamuni. A
halo of mystery is not wanting. Neophytes long for such a happiness, for
such a perfection. To become like Śākyamuni is no mean ideal.

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

It may be urged that Sanctity being its own reward and ending in
annihilation is not a cheerful prospect.

But scholars who identify Nirvāṇa with annihilation would say:

1\. Annihilation is the end of the misery of life, and Buddhists are
pessimists, Buddhists are sick of existence <span
id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69.md).

2\. Indian philosophers, as a rule, do not attach. much importance to
the survival of personal consciousness, which is for us a necessary
characteristic of survival, or rather is the survival itself. With the
strict Vedāntists, Nirvāṇa (*brahmanirvāṇa*) is the end of the illusion
of individuality; with the Sāṃkhyās, Nirvāṇa is the eternal isolation
(*kaivalya*) of the soul, eternal unconsciousness. Therefore, when a
Buddhist admits that Nirvāṇa is annihilation he only goes a step
further.

Again a man works out his ideal of happiness after death from the
pattern of his ideal of happiness here below. According to the Buddhist
and Indian standard, the supreme happiness for a living man is to reach
and to dwell in the

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

concentration 'where feeling and notion are destroyed.' As a matter of
fact, annihilation (*uccheda*, *nirodha*) is this happy state of
concentration continued for eternity. Therefore annihilation is a state
and a happy state.

3\. Nevertheless Indian ascetics were men; and men long for immortality,
not immortal death, but immortal life. There was however a means, an
excellent means of gratifying the needs of the heart while maintaining
the dogma of annihilation.

Death has nothing awful for young people, who have the whole of life
before them, who do not realize that "Live indeed ends in death." In the
same way, annihilation in Nirvāṇa will be easily accepted if Nirvāṇa is
'postponed.'

The monk may be given some existences to reach Nirvāṇa.

At the beginning, almost all the disciples of Śākyamuni became Saints,
to be extinguished at death: but soon a new theory was framed according
to which the state of a Saint requires more than a life-long exercise
and, therefore, is to be realized by steps. There are disciples on the
road to Sanctity to whom seven or less numerous new existences, human or
celestial, are allowed to complete their sanctification.

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

It is worthy of notice that Brahmanism has built parallel theories of
gradual salvation. Side by side with the 'merging in Brahman during this
life'—the only notion known in the earliest texts—the Vedāntists
instituted a discipline leading to deliverance by steps (*kramamukti*).

The reasons of this new departure were certainly manifold. One was that
Sanctity came to be looked upon as a difficult task. The other, and
possibly the stronger, was that monks were really happy to postpone
Nirvāṇa. A 'half saint' is sure to reach Nirvāṇa at the end and sure to
enjoy pleasant rebirths on the way. His lot is a lucky lot indeed.

Neo-Buddhism—Mahāyāna—went far in this direction. Nirvāṇa was relegated
to a remote distance. According to the Lotus of the True Law, a man, to
reach Nirvāṇa, has to become first a Buddha, and, to become a Buddha,
thousands and thousands of strenuous and charitable lives are necessary.
In this way, Buddhism succeeded in getting rid, if not of the very
notion of Nirvāṇa, at least of Nirvāṇa as a practical ideal. The
starting point of this change is to be found in the old theory of the
steps to Sanctity.

#### IV

The preceding remarks have done full justice to the views of Childers,
Rhys Davids, Pischel and other scholars. But we do not believe that the
definition they have given of the aim of the Buddhist religious life,
viz. Sanctity coupled

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

with annihilation, conveys *the* right idea of Nirvāṇa.

It is true that, according to the doctrinal tenets, *strictly*
understood, a Saint is annihilated at death. It is true that there are
categorical statements to this effect, and Max Müller was wrong in
denying that Nirvāṇa in the sense of annihilation is a dogma of
Buddhism. It is a dogma of Buddhism. But Buddhism is not an orthodoxy, a
coherent system of dogmas; it is rather a practical discipline, a
training; and in this discipline, the notion 'Nirvāṇa-annihilation' is
chiefly a result of philosophical inquiry and, therefore, a notion of
secondary rank.

This notion was not an 'original purpose' of Buddhism, a doctrine aimed
at by Śākyamuni. Śākyamuni did not start with such a notion of the
deliverance from birth, old age, death and suffering; this notion was
forced upon him—or upon the Church—because he had been rash enough to
deny the existence of a Self and to invent—or to adopt—the theory of a
composite soul.

This fact must be emphasized, for it seems to be important both for the
history of Buddhism and the history of religion in general. Logic or
dialectic is a dangerous auxiliary of religious thought: doctrines may
be altogether reversed

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

by the development of some dogma; certain premisses being accepted,
conclusions will be as inevitable as destiny itself. But, when such
conclusions are out of harmony with the general spirit of the doctrine,
with the average temperament of the faithful, with common sense, either
they fail to obtain general acceptance and beget only heresies and
sects, or they remain mere theoretical and 'bookish' views, pure ideas,
without becoming what the philosophers style 'idées-forces.'

We have seen that the extreme consequence of the doctrine of Karman,
"What we do is the result of what we have done," has not been admitted
by the Buddhists, firm maintainers of Free-will despite their ontology,
their psychology and their ethics. Many another instance, Indian or
European, might be quoted. (1) The conception of Being in the Upaniṣads
and Vedānta logically ends in pure Monism (*advaita*); and Śaṃkara in
fact is a pure monist, or tries to be a pure monist. But there are many
Vedāntist schools which maintain a variety of 'qualified monisms'
(*viśiṣṭādvaita*). (2) The notions of predestination or absence of
Free-will are easily, we do not say logically, developed from the dogma
of God, creator and all-powerful. These notions found in Mahomedanism a
favourable ground: they agree with the uncompromising and austere
monotheism of Islam and with what is called 'oriental apathy.' While, in
Christendom, they have been repeatedly developed only to be repeatedly
checked.

In the same way, or rather, somewhat in the

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

same way, final annihilation was in Buddhism only a corollary of the
denial of a Self, a result, not an object aimed at by Śākyamuni, not a
postulate of the Indian mind, depressed as it may have been by the
miseries of life, intoxicated as it may have been by philosophical
meditations.

In fact, there are evidences that would lead us to believe that
Śākyamuni did his best to avoid this result, and even objected to a
definite statement of such a result.

 

These evidences are to be found in a number of texts which profess to
state the position taken by Śākyamuni as concerns metaphysics, as
concerns the existence of a soul (*jīva*) distinct from the body, as
concerns the survival of a Saint. This position is a sort of agnosticism
or pragmatism.

Śākyamuni knows everything, but there are truths he refuses to reveal.
The reason of his silence is that the knowledge of the truths which are
not necessary to Sanctity is a dangerous knowledge; or that a man and
even a Saint, is not intelligent enough to gasp certain truths.

That Śākyamuni knows everything, no Buddhist has ever doubted. One of
the most celebrated titles of a Buddha is *sarvajña*,

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'omniscient,' or
with more precision, *sarvākārajña*, 'who knows everything as it is.'
Buddhists believe that Śākyamuni, when he obtained *bodhi*, illumination
or enlightenment, acquired universal knowledge. He does not know, at any
moment, everything, because his knowledge, like all knowledge, consists
of so many distinct and successive acts of attention (*manasikāra*), but
he knows everything he desires to know. Śākyamuni, therefore, never
says: "I do not know," but in some circumstances he says plainly: "You
will not know, you shall not know."

Here is a simile <span id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_70.md):

Śākyamuni was staying at Kauśambī in the grove of Asoka trees. He took a
few Asoka leaves in his hand and said to his disciples: "What do you
think, O monks, whether these few leaves, which I have gathered in my
hand, are more, or the other leaves yonder in the grove? "—"The few
leaves which the Lord holds in his hand are not many, but many more are
those leaves in the grove."—"So also, O monks, is that much more which I
have learned and not told you than that which I have told you."

Śākyamuni is said to have left unsettled, to have set aside and rejected
the questions concerning the existence of a soul (*jīva*) distinct from
the body, and the nature of Nirvāṇa.

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

As a matter of fact, there are in the Canon many sayings of Śākyamuni
which, at least indirectly, settle these questions in the sense of
soullessness and annihilation. We may admit (1) that some disciples, or
many disciples, felt dissatisfied with the nihilistic doctrines, and
therefore hoped, at the bottom of their hearts, that they misunderstood
the Master. Let us not forget that the disciples of Śākyamuni came to
him as to the discoverer of the path to immortality (*amṛta*). Or,
possibly (2) there were monks without any prejudices, anxious only to be
made quite sure about Nirvāṇa, not by logical conclusions drawn from
psychological premisses, not by metaphorical and conflicting phrases,
but by a direct and definite statement from the lips of the Omniscient.
Last, not least, (3) there were monks who had never heard of the
nihilistic sayings of Śākyamuni and wondered at Śākyamuni's silence
concerning soul and survival.

Māluṅkyāputta was one of these monks <span
id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_71.md).

"There are," said Māluṅkyāputta, "questions that Buddha has left
unsettled, has set aside and rejected. . . whether the soul and the body
are identical; whether the soul is one thing and the body another;
whether a saint exists after death; whether a saint does not exist after
death; whether a saint both exists and does

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

not exist after death; whether a saint neither exists nor does not exist
after death. . . . The fact that Buddha does not settle these questions
does not please me. I will inquire. If he does not answer, in that case
I abandon the religious life under the rule of Buddha."

Māluṅkyāputta questions Buddha accordingly, and ends by uttering very
strong words: "If the Lord does not know, the only upright thing for one
who does not know, is to say: I do not know."

Buddha, of course, does not confess that he does not know, nor does he
answer the questions.

Did I ever say to you: "Come, lead the religious life under me and I
will explain to you these points"? or did you say to me: "I will lead
the religious life under you on condition that you will explain to me
these points"?

Māluṅkyāputta confesses that Buddha has not given any pledge to that
effect, and that he himself did not state any condition of his accepting
the Buddhist rule. And Buddha continues:

Any one who should say: "I will not lead the religious life under Buddha
until Buddha explains all these points," that man would die before
Buddha had ever explained these points to him.

Men are suffering from actual pains which are to be healed at once; they
are poisoned with desire, and desire prepares for them new rebirths and
new sufferings: desire is to be crushed.

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

It is as if a man had been wounded by an arrow thickly smeared with
poison, and this man were to say: "I will not have this arrow taken out
until I have learnt whether the man who wounded me belongs to the caste
of the warriors. . . before I have been told his name, his clan, his
stature, his complexion; before I have been told the nature of the bow,
of the bow-string. . ." This man would die before he knew.

As the knowledge of all these circumstances has nothing to do with the
removal of the deadly arrow, even so the knowledge of the metaphysical
points is totally extraneous to the discipline which abolishes suffering
and desire, to the discipline of Sanctity:

The religious life does not depend on the dogma that the soul and the
body are identical, on the dogma that the soul is one thing and the body
another thing, on the dogma that a saint exists, does not exist, both
exists and does not exist, neither exists nor does not exist after
death. Whether this or that dogma is true, there still remain birth, old
age, death, for the extinction of which I am giving instructions. . . .
What I have left unsettled, let that remain unsettled.

Thus spoke Śākyamuni.

These 'agnostic' statements are astonishingly to the point. Whatever
opinion a Buddhist may entertain concerning the destiny of a dead Saint,
this opinion is an obstacle to serenity, to detachment, to Sanctity, and
therefore to Nirvāṇa itself.

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

If Nirvāṇa be a happy state, the monk would strive for Nirvāṇa as one
would strive for a paradise, and he would accordingly miss it: he would
reach at death some paradise, an enjoyable but transitory paradise. If
Nirvāṇa be annihilation, Nirvāṇa would again inspire desire or
abhorrence: in both cases, Sanctity is impossible. Anxiety and
speculation concerning the life after death (*antagrāhaparāmarśa*) is
one of the five heresies. Therefore, "let that remain unsettled that has
not been settled by Śākyamuni." A monk will reach Sanctity and Nirvāṇa,
without knowing what Nirvāṇa is, and for this very reason that, owing to
this ignorance, he remains free from the desire of existence
(*bhavatṛṣṇā*), free from the desire of non-existence (*vibhavatṛṣṇā*):
"I do not long for life; I do not long for death."

We believe that the most exact and the most authoritative definition of
Nirvāṇa is not annihilation, but 'unqualified deliverance,' a
deliverance of which we have no right to predicate anything.

The idea of Nirvāṇa generally cherished by the Buddhists is not a
positive one. They know that existence is suffering. And they think that
there is an exit, a Nirvāṇa, deliverance from

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

transmigration, from birth, disease, old age and death; and that is
indeed enough.

Nirvāṇa is looked upon as a deliverance: just as a man who is in gaol
wants only to be free, even so Man do be happy; he only wants to be
delivered from the miseries of life. That is pessimism.

It is not absolute nihilism, nihilism boldly looked at in the face. It
is a negative attitude, which does not appeal to the most innate needs
of our mind; but it is also to some extent an expectant attitude, which
leaves some food to the needs of the human heart. The monk strives for
unqualified deliverance; he does not inquire whether deliverance is
destruction or a mysterious kind of existence; but he knows that
Śākyamuni is omniscient and compassionate, and such a 'caravan-leader'
is the great man upon whom it is safe to rely.

It remains to draw the conclusion of our inquiry, that is, to strike a
sort of balance between the contradictory statements with which we are
counted, and to reconcile these statements if possible.

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

According to the doctrinal tenets of Buddhism, accurately and profusely
explained in every part of the Scriptures, Nirvāṇa is annihilation:
selflessness is, from our point of view, incompatible with any kind of
survival of the Saint. But do the Buddhists draw from their tenets the
logical conclusion concerning Nirvāṇa? They do; or some of them do:
there are categorical statements to prove that the compilers of some
parts of the Scriptures identified Nirvāṇa with annihilation.

Moreover it is not doubtful that Sanctity was for many a monk the very
deliverance, the very Nirvāṇa preached by Buddha.

But this conception of Sanctity as a goal in itself, if it agrees with
the nihilistic view of Nirvāṇa,—Nirvāṇa in the sense of
annihilation,—agrees as well with the 'agnostic' texts, with Nirvāṇa in
the sense of 'unqualified deliverance.'

The whole Suttanipāta testifies to the Buddhist dislike of 'opinion.'
The religious life, as depicted in this book, one of the oldest, is not
compatible with any opinion. Everything supports our surmise that
'annihilation' is the result of the philosophical inquiry, a mere
scholastic corollary.

Moreover, while we are not willing to 'maximize' the importance of the
few scriptural texts

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

which affirm the existence of a Self, under the name of *pudgala* (an
individual, a person), these texts cannot be ignored altogether. They
are old; they are no less authentic than the selflessness texts; they
are the authoritative texts of the Sammitīya sect, an important school.
The maintainers of the *pudgala* theory will admit that Nirvāṇa, the
state of a Saint after death, is existence.

And, in this connexion, we are not sure that all the scriptural
passages, which describe Nirvāṇa as a happy and stable condition, refer
to Nirvāṇa in the sense of Sanctity; some of them at least may refer to
the state of a Saint after death. If they all refer to Sanctity, as is
often contended by scholars, the reference is more than once very
obscure.

The obvious conclusion is that the ancient Buddhist tradition was not
clear on the nature of Nirvāṇa as well as on many other points.

This conclusion does not please those scholars who are prepared to turn
primitive Buddhism into an orthodoxy. While we believe that the
scriptural contradictions—Nirvāṇa annihilation, Nirvāṇa immortality,
Nirvāṇa a prohibited problem—are to be accepted as they are; while we
believe that the true Buddhist state of mind

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

is a happy syncretism, scholars of a more orthodox or less catholic
temperament make a choice among the conflicting views; they deny,
expressly or tacitly, the authenticity or the authority of the texts
which support the view they have rejected <span
id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_72.md).

Much is to be learned from the position taken by the philosophers of the
Mahāyāna school (neo-Buddhism). They are both honest and clear-sighted;
they are plainly conscious of the contradictions of the Scriptures; they
are, on the other hand, firm believers in the authenticity of these
Scriptures; they cannot, therefore, resort to the Gordian method of
exegesis.

As *philosophers*, they have to make a choice and unanimously maintain
the nihilistic interpretation of Self and of Nirvāṇa. But, as
*historians*, they confess that Śākyamuni sometimes indulged in
'ontological' statements, sometimes simply prohibited inquiry concerning
the 'unsettled questions,' sometimes taught annihilation. They explain
why he did so, and the

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

reasons they give for the contradictions of the Master are of
far-reaching importance as concerns the philosophical solution of the
problem itself.

It is an old opinion among the Buddhists that Śākyamuni has modified his
teaching according to the needs of his hearers, according to their
intellectual and moral possibilities. Let us understand his position. A
Buddha is a physician, the physician of this mortal disease that is
named desire. Desire originates rebirth, suffering, death. In order to
cure this disease, Śākyamuni had to employ 'allopathic' contrivances. He
teaches that there is not a Self—and with such an emphasis that he
sometimes gives the impression of being a 'materialist'—because a man
who believes in the reality and permanence of his Self will love his
Self, will hate the Self of his neighbour, will be anxious about the
state of his Self after death, in a word will desire. He teaches that
there is rebirth, because the idea of annihilation at death is likely to
produce the heresy of "Let us live happily so long as we are alive." He
emphasizes the happiness of deliverance, in order to induce men to give
up the trivial hopes of transitory paradises and many foolish devices to
this end: deliverance is better than any conceivable state

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

of existence. Last, not least, Śākyamuni does not hide this fact that
deliverance is absolute silence and annihilation, the end of suffering,
because it is the end of feeling. Why does he teach such a doctrine? I
dare say, because the most pragmatist of the philosophers cannot help
sometimes describing things as he believes they are: deliverance *is*
annihilation—and there are some few disciples worthy to be told the
truth.

The simile of the physician is a Buddhist metaphor. There is another to
the same effect, more Indian and also very exact. A Buddha is a tiger or
rather a tigress. This tigress has to transport her cub, and accordingly
takes it into her mouth; she holds it between her double set of teeth.
But for the teeth, the cub would fall; but if the teeth were to be
tightly closed, it would be crushed. In the same way a Buddha saves
beings, transports them across the ocean of transmigration, by the
parallel teaching of permanence and impermanence, Self and Selflessness,
bliss of Nirvāṇa and annihilation in Nirvāṇa. Permanence, Self, bliss of
Nirvāṇa: so many falsehoods. Useful falsehoods: but for them one would
give up the religious training towards deliverance. Impermanence,
selflessness, annihilation: so many truths. Dangerous truths,

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

like a serpent with a jewel in its hood: it requires a clever hand to
take the jewel. In the same way, few men are able to avoid being crushed
by these sublime and terrible truths. Selflessness wrongly understood
would lead to the wrong view that there is no survival; the doctrine of
annihilation in Nirvāṇa would originate despair or distrust.

Therefore Śākyamuni has been obscure on these points, and did not avoid
some contradictions; and, when an inquirer was bold enough to ask for a
plain answer, he plainly answered: "You shall not know." *Cela ne vous
regarde pas*.

Buddhism ends in an act of faith. Śākyamuni will lead us to salvation
provided we close our eyes and follow blindly his ordinances. The
important thing in Buddhism is not dogma, but practice, not the goal,
the mysterious and unascertainable Nirvāṇa, but the Path, Sanctity.
