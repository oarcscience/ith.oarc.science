##### *b. Belief in the Existence of Atman in Things.*

As the World-honored One (*Bhagavat*), considering the inferior
intellectual calibre of Çrâvakas and Pratyekabuddhas, taught them only
the doctrine of non-personal âtman, \[and did not make any further

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

demonstration of the doctrine\], the people have in the meantime formed
a fixed idea on the transitoriness of the five skandhas, <span
id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_166.md) and, being terrified at the thought of
birth and death, have fanatically craved for Nirvâna.

In order that this clinging may be eliminated, be it clearly understood
that the essence of the five skandhas is uncreate, there is no
annihilation of them; that since there is no annihilation of them, they
are in their \[metaphysical\] origin Nirvâna itself; that if one be
absolutely freed from particularisation and attachment, one will
understand that all things both pure and defiled have only relative
existence.

Be it therefore known that all things in the world from the beginning
are neither matter (*rûpa*), nor mind (*citta*), nor intelligence
(*prajñâ*), nor consciousness (*vijñâna*), nor non-being (*abhâva*), nor
being (*bhâva*); they are after all inexplicable. The reason why the
Tathâgata nevertheless endeavors to instruct by means of words and
definitions is through his good and excellent skilfulness \[or
expediency, *upâya-kauçalya*\]. <span id="fr_167"></span>[2](#fn_167.md) He
only provisionally makes use of words and definitions to lead all
beings, while his real object is to make them abandon symbolism and
directly enter

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

into the real reality (*tattva*). Because if they indulge themselves in
reasonings, attach themselves to sophistry, and thus foster their
subjective particularisation, how could they have the true wisdom
(*tattvajñâna*) and attain to Nirvâna?

<span id="fn_167"></span>[112:2](taf26.htm#fr_167.md) See the second
chapter of the Saddharmapundarîka Sûtra, in which Buddha teaches how the
only one yâna (vehicle) is split through his transcendental upâya
(skilfulness or expediency) into three yânas: Çrâvakayâna,
Pratyekabuddhayâna, and Bodhisattvayâna.
