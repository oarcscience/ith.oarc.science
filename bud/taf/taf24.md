#### *2. The Refutation of False Doctrines.*

All false doctrines invariably come out of the âtman-conception. If we
were liberated from it, the existence of false doctrines would be
impossible.

There are two kinds of the âtman-conception: (1) Belief in the existence
of a personal atman \[or ego-soul\]; (2) Belief in the existence of
âtman in thing\[or things-in-themselves\]. <span

existence of things-in-themselves is one of the principal features of
the Mahâyâna as distinguished from the Hînayâna Buddhism.
