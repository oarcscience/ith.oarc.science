Asvaghosa's The Awakening of Faith is one of the most concise works on
Mahayana Buddhism, and was translated at an early date from the Sanskrit
to the Chinese. The original Sanskrit text is lost. The Awakening of
Faith has been used as a textbook for Buddhist priests. This translation
was the first into English; it is by Teitaro Suzuki, one of the
principal writers on Buddhism of the 20th century. Suzuki, a Zen
Buddhist scholar, manages to convey the difficult sense of this work,
which sometimes requires inventive English neologisms. For the
perplexed, there is a [glossary](taf30.md) at the end of the book.
