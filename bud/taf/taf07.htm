<p>There is not so much discordance in the traditions about the wanderings of A&ccedil;vaghosha as about his date, though indeed we do not have as yet any means of ascertaining his birth-place, other than the statements</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_18"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 18</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of discordant authorities. According to T&acirc;ran&acirc;tha,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> he was a son of a rich Brahman called Samghaguhya who married the tenth and youngest daughter of a merchant in Khorta. As a youth, when thoroughly familiar with every department of knowledge, he went to Odivi&ccedil;a, Gaura, T&icirc;rahuti, K&acirc;mar&ucirc;pa, and some other places, defeating everywhere his Buddhist opponents by his ingenious logic.</p>  
<p>All these places are situated in Eastern India, and among the Chinese traditions the <i>Record of the Triratna</i> (<i>Li tai san pao chi</i>) as well as the <i>Accounts of Buddha and the Patriarchs</i> (<i>Fo tsu tung chi</i>) agree with T&acirc;ran&acirc;tha in placing A&ccedil;vaghosha's native land in the East; but the <i>Life of Vasubandhu</i> makes A&ccedil;vaghosha a native of Bh&acirc;shita in &Ccedil;r&acirc;vast&icirc;, while in N&acirc;g&acirc;rjuna's work, the <i>Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na&ccedil;&acirc;stravy&acirc;khy&acirc;</i> <A NAME="img_01800"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/01800.jpg"> (<i>Shih mo ho yen lun</i>), he is mentioned as having been born in Western India, Loka being the father and Gho&#7751;&acirc; the mother. The <i>Record of Buddha and the Patriarchs Under Successive Dynasties</i> (<i>Fo tsu li tai t&#8216;ung tsai</i>) agrees with neither of the above statements, for it says (<A HREF="errata.htm#3"><i>fasciculus</i></A> 5): "The twelfth patriarch, A&ccedil;vaghosha Mah&acirc;sattva was a native of V&acirc;r&acirc;&#7751;as&icirc;." A further contradicting tradition is pointed out by Prof. S. Murakami in one of his articles on the history of Buddhism,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> quoting the <i>Shittanz&ocirc;</i> <A NAME="img_01801"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/01801.jpg"> (<i>fas</i>. 1), which makes A&ccedil;vaghosha a man of South India.</p>

<p>A majority of the traditions place his native country in East India; but there is no means of confirming these. One thing, however, seems to be certain, namely, that A&ccedil;vaghosha was not born in the northern part of India, which place is supposed by most Western Buddhist scholars to be the cradle of the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na school.</p>  
<p>Wherever the native country of A&ccedil;vaghosha may have been, both the Chinese and Tibetan records agree that he made a journey to Central India, or Magadha. it seems that every intellectual man in India, the people of which, living in affluence, were not occupied with the cares of making a living, sought to gain renown by dialectics and subtle reasonings, and A&ccedil;vaghosha, as a Brahman whose "intellectual acquirements were wonderfully deep," and whose "penetrating insight was matchless,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> could not resist the temptation. Not satisfied with his intellectual campaign against commonplace Buddhists in his neighborhood, who were crushed down as "rotten wood before a raging hurricane,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> he went, according to a Chinese tradition, to P&acirc;&#7789;aliputra, and according to the Tibetan, to N&acirc;landa. The <i>Life of A&ccedil;vaghosha</i> evidently refers to this fact when it states that Par&ccedil;va, the eleventh patriarch and eventual teacher of A&ccedil;vaghosha, on being informed of the paramount influence of the Brahman</p>

<p>t&icirc;rthaka (i.e., A&ccedil;vaghosha) in Central India and of the fact that his conquest over Buddhists had silenced the bell (<i>ghanta</i>) in some monastery (<i>vih&acirc;ra</i>), journeyed from Northern India to convert the bitterest opponent into a faithful follower of Buddha. He adds that A&ccedil;vaghosha left his home and lived henceforth in Central India. But according to the <i>Transmission of the Dharmapitaka</i> (<i>Fu fa tsang ch&#8216;uan</i>, <i>fas</i>. 5) we find A&ccedil;vaghosha even after his conversion still in P&acirc;&#7789;aliputra, from which he was taken by King Kanishka to the latter's own capital, Gandh&acirc;ra, in the Northwest of India.</p>  
<p>Thus all that we can say about the birth-place and wanderings of A&ccedil;vaghosha is: (1) he was a Brahman by birth either of South, or of West, or of East, but not of North India; (2) he acquired in Central India his highest reputation as a Brahman disputant, and, after his conversion, as the greatest Buddha follower of the time, intellectually as well as morally; (3) his later life was spent according to the Chinese authority in the North where he wrote probably the <i>Mah&acirc;lamk&acirc;ra-s&ucirc;tra&ccedil;&acirc;stra</i> (<i>Book of Great Glory)</i> which describes matters mostly relating to Western India.</p>
